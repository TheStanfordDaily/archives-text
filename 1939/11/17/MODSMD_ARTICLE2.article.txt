# Europe Set For Lengthy Sea Struggle
## Britain Claims Nazi Shipping Virtually Driven from Ocean 
### United Press 
Willi the war on the western
front bogged down, perhaps for the
entire winter, Europe's warring
powers mustered their strength to
day for a long and relentless strug
gle on the high seas.
This war, to a greater extent even
than the one of 1914-18, may be de
cided more by warships, U-boats,
blockade and counter-blockade than
by the soldiers massed along the
Siegfried and Maginot Lines.
Assaults on those deep lines of
fortifications which have replaced
the muddy trenches of 21 years ago
would take a toll of tens of thou
sands of lives, whereas the victor in
the war at sea stands to reap a "vic
tory of starvation."
CLAIMS SHIPPING STOPPED
British Chancellor of the Ex
chequer Sir John Simon, speaking
for gout - suffering Prime Minister
Chamberlain in the British House of
Commons yesterday, claimed Ger
man shipping had been virtually
driven from the seas by the British
and French blockade of Germany. \
Germany, he said, has lost six I
ships in less than two weeks while
Britain's own merchant shipping
soon is to be protected from U-boat
and sea-raider's attacks by in
creased naval convoys.
A British announcement, telling
of Anglo-French naval co-opera
tion, indicated the two allies are
pooling their world's biggest and
fastest fighting ships in an effort to
track down and either sink or cap
ture Germany's "pocket battleships,"
Deutschland and Admiral Scheer.
NAZIS WARN AGAIN
Europe's harried neutral nations I
were served with another Nazi
warning Thursday night. The offi
cial news agency in Berlin told the
neutrals they will suffer if they give
in to Britain's reported endeavors to
press the economic war against the
Reich still further by taking over
markets dominated by the Nazis be
fore the outbreak of war. The neu
trals' best chances of security, the
statement said, lie in peaceful and
profitable trade with Germany.
One of these fleet, 10,000-ton Nazi
battleships was reported from
South Africa to have sunk a British
tanker between the Portuguese East
African mainland and Madagascar.
It was the Deutschland which cap
tured the American freighter City of
Flint in the Atlantic on Oct. 9.
Germany, rejecting any prospects
of peace mediation until "the war
has ended victoriously for us," said
Germany's U-boats are increasing
their successes over the Allied
blockade, returning regularly to
their bases after sinking or captur
ing merchant ships.

were served with another Nazi
warning Thursday night. The offi
cial news agency in Berlin told the
neutrals they will suffer if they give
in to Britain's reported endeavors to
press the economic war against the
Reich still further by taking over
markets dominated by the Nazis be
fore the outbreak of war. The neu
trals' best chances of security, the
statement said, lie in peaceful and
profitable trade with Germany.
One of these fleet, 10,000-ton Nazi
battleships was reported from
South Africa to have sunk a British
tanker between the Portuguese East
African mainland and Madagascar.
It was the Deutschland which cap
tured the American freighter City of
Flint in the Atlantic on Oct. 9.
Germany, rejecting any prospects
of peace mediation until "the war
has ended victoriously for us," said
Germany's U-boats are increasing
their successes over the Allied
blockade, returning regularly to
their bases after sinking or captur
ing merchant ships.
Willi the war on the western
front bogged down, perhaps for the
entire winter, Europe's warring
powers mustered their strength to
day for a long and relentless strug
gle on the high seas.
This war, to a greater extent even
than the one of 1914-18, may be de
cided more by warships, U-boats,
blockade and counter-blockade than
by the soldiers massed along the
Siegfried and Maginot Lines.
Assaults on those deep lines of
fortifications which have replaced
the muddy trenches of 21 years ago
would take a toll of tens of thou
sands of lives, whereas the victor in
the war at sea stands to reap a "vic
tory of starvation."
CLAIMS SHIPPING STOPPED
British Chancellor of the Ex
chequer Sir John Simon, speaking
for gout - suffering Prime Minister
Chamberlain in the British House of
Commons yesterday, claimed Ger
man shipping had been virtually
driven from the seas by the British
and French blockade of Germany. \
Germany, he said, has lost six I
ships in less than two weeks while
Britain's own merchant shipping
soon is to be protected from U-boat
and sea-raider's attacks by in
creased naval convoys.
A British announcement, telling
of Anglo-French naval co-opera
tion, indicated the two allies are
pooling their world's biggest and
fastest fighting ships in an effort to
track down and either sink or cap
ture Germany's "pocket battleships,"
Deutschland and Admiral Scheer.
