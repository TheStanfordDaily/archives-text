### 
Pi c-Big Game "invasions" between
Stanford and the University of Cali
fornia continued Wednesday night
as eight Farm freshmen successfully
painted Cal's Big "C," and an un
known number of Berkeley students
painted large yellow "Cal's" and
"Californias" on the walks in front
of Jordan Hall on the campus.
Both the painting of the Big
"C" and the lettering on the Jor
dan liall walks arc in violation
of an inter-school agreement made
between the two universities In
193f», which reads as follows:
"In order to avoid any occur
rence that might endanger the
friendly relations that have ex
isted between our Universities for
so many years, and in order to
maintain the fine sportsmanship
that has been the tradition of our
'Big Game,' we, the representatives
of our student bodies, do hereby
resolve: (a) That there shall Ik
no 'invasions' by the students of
either University of the campus
of the other, and that students
participating in such violations
will be subject to severe disci
pline; and (b) That each student
body will undertake to cducatc its
members in the week preceding
the 'Big Game' to observe the
spirit of the foregoing resolution,
and to exercise every possible
measure to prevent any incident
arising that may lead to its vio
lation."
The agreement was signed by Jim
Reynolds, then president, of the
A.S.S.U., and Leonard Charvet, then
president of the California student
body.
Ken Cuthbertson, president of the
Associated Students, stated yester
day that "in accordance with the
agreement, any Farm student caught
damaging California property will
be disciplined by the proper author

The eight Stanford men YVednes

-1 died frosh had tried to do the night
I before—they painted the Big "C."
j Traveling to the Cal campus by way
I of Alviso, they circled behind Ber
: keley and parked on Grizzly Peak.
From there they walked to the mon
ument and proceeded to paint a large
| portion of it with bright red paint.
I There was no one guarding it, the
! informant said, and they were not
: interrupted. As they left, the chimes
L in the Campanile rang five o'clock.
| In the meantime, a number of
j California students, evidently want
ing to "get even" with Stanford for
the Card invasion Tuesday night,
painted "Cal" and "California" in
large yellow letters on the walks in
front of Jordan Hall. No one re
ported seeing them do it, but the fact
that the paint was still quite wet at
noon today suggested to observers
hat it had also been done early this
morning.
