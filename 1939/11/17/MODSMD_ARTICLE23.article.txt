# Injury-Riddled Cardinals Favored Over Cougars; Standlee to Start Came
## Play-off for Cellar Post in Coast Conference Looms; Injuries Ban Groves, Coldiron from Playing Field 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Injury-riddled almost beyond recognition, Stanford's shot football
troop must meet Washington State College at 2 o'clock tomorrow in
the Stadium.
If you look closely enough, you may recognize a familiar face in our
Indians' stalling line-up. It's not quite tliat had, luit if Tiny were to put

>Dll his first and second-string in
juries together—along with a center,
right guard, left tackle, fullback,
and left halfback—he'd have a squad
which could handle very well about
any team in the conference.
Tiny Thomhill's cripples and senti
cripplcs are quoted favorites—by uji
ever so slim margin, but favored
nevertheless. When our Indians
started tobogganing down the defeat
trail some weeks ago, the Stanford
adherents began looking forward to
the time when Orin E. "Babe" Hol
lingbery would bring his Cougara
down to the Farm.
STANFORD FAVORED
They figured that since W.S.C.
had been defeated by Cal, and Cal
had taken shellackings from the Tro
jans, College of the Pacific, et al.,
therefore, Stanford was a cinch
against the Cougars.
Tomorrow these two injury
racked football teams — Washington
State the least bad off—clash to stay
out of the conference cellar. The law
of averages, betting odds, and close
followers of the teams—everyone but
the law of injuries — say that our
doddering Indian is going to get its
first scalp of the year.
NO CARD SCRIMMAGE
So fearful was Tiny that he'd get
some more unlooked-for cripples
this week, that he called off all
scrimmages. At least through yester
day's workout, Stanford had no
more than two ends, a tackle, one
guard, two quarterbacks, one right
halfback, and three fullbacks—lo,
count, 'em — hobbling around on
crutches, with knee braces, etc.
Norm Standlee, who has averaged
well over three yards per crack in
six games, came up with a bad ankle
I Wednesday night, but the chief will
j start at full, however. Neither Thor
I Peterson nor John Casey, his subs,
I who haven't had to do much sub
bing to date, can be counted upon.
! Peterson still has a stiff back from
] his injury before the Husky tilt.
Jim Groves' decision to give up
football will leave Hugh Gallarneau,
: Pete Kmetovic, and Johnny Stur
| geon to carry on at right half.
Frankie Albert, Moon Mullin, and
"Cookie" South will be at left half.
! Bob Crane will start at quarter,
i alternating with Sturgeon. Gene
