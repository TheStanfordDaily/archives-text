# U.S. Justice Pierce Butler, New Deal Enemy, Dies at 73
## Successor to Be Fifth Roosevelt Appointee; McReynolds May Retire 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 16 (UP). — j
| Associate Justice Pierce Butler of |
| the U. S. Supreme Court, one ofl
1 the tribunal's two unyielding foes of j
! New Deal legislation, died today and j
i speculation on his successor pointed I
; to several prominent administration '
figures, especially Attorney General j
, Frank Murphy.
Death of the 73-year-old conserva
tive at 4:15 a.m. removed from the i
bench its only Catholic member and j
I guaranteed the perpetuation of a dis- i
tinct New Deal majority in the court j
for probably the next generation. j
[ His sucessor will be the fifth j
; Roosevelt appointee to join the nine- i
i man tribunal.
i OLD ERA OVER
Butler's passing, after several,
months of illness, was like the p-jss- I
ing of an era in the court's history.'
By enabling President Roosevelt to ;
name a fifth member of the tri- j
bunal, the death ended the bitter |
: political battle which started two.
J years ago when the chief executive i
| sought unsuccessfully to enlarge the I
membership of the highest judiciary '
! unit in the nation, presumably to j
• change the balance of power in fa- i
vor of the New Deal.
Butler, with his colleague, Asso- !
j date Justice James Clark Mcßey-|
nolds, clung to his so-called "con- i
i servative" principles to the end. The
! two fought relentlessly, if hopelessly,
| against each ruling in favor of the
i New Deal. They filed minority |
I opinions which crackled and bristled .
I with their condemnation of the new
I social and economic theories of gov
| eminent.
McREYNOLDS MAY RETIRE
Mcßeynolds alone remains. Pass- |
ing of the conservative majority left
him an unhappy old man. Thus it
was natural today the capital spec- j
ulated whether the death of his old j
friend might not hasten the retire- '
ment which he reportedly has been !
contemplating for some time.
Chief Justice Charles Evans
Hughes announced funeral services'
would be held tomorrow morning at
St. Matthews Cathedral here, with
the entire membership of the court
; present. The body then will be sent

to Butler's native Minnesota after
wards for another service at St.
Luke's Church in St. Paul next
Monday.


JUSTICE FIERCE BUTLER
