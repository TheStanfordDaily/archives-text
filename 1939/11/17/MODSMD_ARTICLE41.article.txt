# Rides for Game Dance Provided
## A.S.S.U. Arranges Bus Transportation 
### 
With the $5 tickets selling rapidly
at the A.S.S.U. office, Ned Pugh,
chairman of ticket sales for the Big
Game dance, yesterday stressed the
importance of buying them soon.
Today begins the final week of
sales before the celebration on
Nov. 25.
Jiminie Grier and his band will
be making their first appearance
before an exclusively Stanford au
dience. "The musical host of the
coast" has made several South
American tours and climaxed a long
list of engagements with a five-year
booking at the Biltmore in Los An
geles.
An additional service for the stu
dent body was announced yester
day by A.S.S.U. President Ken
Cuthberlson. For those who may
have difficulty securing a ride for
the evening, buses with a capacity
of 18 couples each will transport
celebrationists to and from the Mill
brae Country Club.
Cost of transportation will be $1
per couple, and reservations should
be made at the A.S.S.U. office, ac-
I cording to Cuthbertson.
