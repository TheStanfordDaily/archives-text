## Pfyl Stars as Firemen Trip El Toro in Grid Intramurals Firehouse Boys to Meet Zeta Psi Next Week in All-University Finals 
### JERRY MAYER, Sports Editor 
Behind the fancy passing and ball
carrying of Monte Pfyl, Firehouse
yesterday won its way into the finals
of the all-University football cham
pionship playoffs by defeating El
Toro, 12-0. The Firehouse boys will
meet Zeta Psi in the finals either
Monday or Tuesday.
1 Yesterday's game turned into a
brilliant passing duel between Pfyl
and Frank Van Acker of Toro, but
the speed and deceptive aerial attack
of the Firehouse proved the winning
factor.
Pfyl circled right end from two
yards out to post the first of the
winners' touchdowns, after two other
j scores during this same drive were
| called back because of penalties.
Pfyl dodged 11 yards through cen
ter to register the second score after
! his sensational running pass con
| nected to brother Frank Pfyl for a
| 40-yard gain to put the ball in posi

tion.
The Zetes entered the finals last
Wednesday when they nosed out the
Phi Psi's by an 8-6 margin.
Next week's final game will pit i
opposite each other two teams with |
first-class passing attacks. "Cootie"
Thompson, varsity baseball chucker, I
has been hurling passes far and
hard to Bill Hawkins and Howard
Hickingbotham for repeated gains
against Zeta Psi's opponents.
The small Firehouse team, fast,
tricky, and unpredictable, can't
match the Zetes for size, but with
their speed and agility the boys who
chase the blazes are a threat any
time they get their hands on the
ball.
No matter which team wins, the
trophy that goes to the champion will
change hands this year, as the de
fending champion Delta Chi outfit
was trounced by El Toro.
