## Noisy Fans, 700 Strong, Cheer Bouts Pavilion Matches Fast Ellett Beats Rosengren in Third 
### PAT NOWELL 
A howling crowd of more than
700 light fans cheered as eight new
novice champions were crowned
last night in Encina Pavilion.
Mel El let I. had the audience
shouting lustily as he unleashed a
ceaseless barrage of rights and lelts
to score a T.K. over Ken Rosen
gren in the third round in what
many considered the best fight ol
the evening.
Releree Jake Irwin stopped the
165-pound brawl when a hard right
to the jaw sent Rosengren to the
canvas for the first time in a bout
that was crammed with action. Ros
engren fought back gamely, but the
rugged, heavy-hitting Ellett was
just too tough.
BOUT LASTS MINUTE
In a short but exciting minute of
the first round, Jack Elliott won a
T.K.O. over Brownell Carr in the
light - heavyweight bout. Ellioti
walked out and started hitting Carr
on the chin with terrific punches.
Referee Irwin stopped the massacre
when Carr started reeling, and kept
him from an almost certain knock
out.
Jimmy McCloud pushed the 155-
pound fight all the way, and clev
erly outboxed James Thurmond to
get the decision. Experience won
this one, with Thurmond showing a
devastating light hand that blasted
the atmosphere and nothing else
throughout the battle.
This was McCloud's third appear
ance in the finals of the novice tour
nament, and he finally succeeded in
winning the golden boxing glove
trophy which he long ago promised
his mother.
ENCINA DISAPPOINTED
Partisan Encinamen booed their
disapproval as Blair Hyde edged out
l'rosh Frank Hewitt for the 135-
pound trophy. This was easily the
best boxing exhibition of the eve
ning, with both contestants showing
speed and skill. The highlight of
this bout was a brief resort to wres
tling when both fighters became en
tangled and half struggled, half fell
clear across the ring before the ref
eree could separate them.
The heavyweight match was a bat
tle of left hands, with Don Grant
finally copping the duke trom Bob
Leaver. The fight was close all the
way, with Grant's aggressiveness and
superior punching finally giving
him the nod.
After being dropped for no count
by a right to the chin in the second
round, Ted Doe came back to clearly
outpoint Terry Green in the 120-
pound class. Doe showed a good left
that kept Green from getting close
enough to do any damage through
out. most of the fight.
In the "fraternal battle" of the
evening, Dell Bill Jess won the de
cision going away from Delt Bob
Love. It was just, a case of too
much "older brother.'
TUMBLERS DEMONSTRATE
Dick Lyon, 127 pounds, came
back strongly in the third round to
salvage a close decision from
George Linsley.
Director of Minor Sports Harry
Maloney presented the awards. A
hand balancing act by Bill Van
born and an exhibition on the par
allel bars by tumbling coach Ken
Edwards and Al Kittell were pre
sented between the fourth and fifth
lights.
Johnny Seamans announced the
bouts; Jake Irwin refereed; Elwyn
ißugge, Hilmer Lodge, and Bill El
lington kept time; D. 13. Kearney
Dr. Ray Bangle, Fred Glover, and
Daniel Feeley acted as judges.

Partisan Encinamen booed their
disapproval as Blair Hyde edged out
l'rosh Frank Hewitt for the 135-
pound trophy. This was easily the
best boxing exhibition of the eve

speed and skill. The highlight of
this bout was a brief resort to wres

tangled and half struggled, half fell
clear across the ring before the ref
eree could separate them.

superior punching finally giving
him the nod.

round, Ted Doe came back to clearly

enough to do any damage through
out. most of the fight.

Love. It was just, a case of too
much "older brother.'
