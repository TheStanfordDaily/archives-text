STANFORD HAS ONE
When I was a little shirt-tailed
kid, I can remember a moving sym- ,
phony of steel-like muscle who j
used to perform under the name ol i
Jim Musick, University of Southern !
California fullback.
Every week 80,000 persons, or up
wards, used to jam the Los Angoles
Coliseum to see this man rip gaping i
holes in opponents' lorward walls.
He brought thrills to grown-ups as!
well as youngsters with his surging, |
splendid power. No one tackier
over knocked Jim Musick down; j
that was a job lor a whole team, j
not an individual.
tl lias always seemed (o me that
(here was no thrill (hat can quite
compare with watching a bone
cruiiching backliehl man hash his
way through a line, howling over
player after player on his mad
way to a score. I would much
rather watch a sharp-hitting hack j
break through for consistent six- j
and eight-yard gains that I would I
sec some fancy stepper snake-hip .
his way half the length ol the field [
to a touchdown.
It's not that I don't appreciate
the scintillating brilliance of the \
open field runner, but line-crashing'
just .seems to be the American way i
of playing a typically American |
game. Nothing fancy, just the j
straight and narrow path. Plus a i
generous amount of intestinal for
titude and determination.
Down through the years 1 have !
been watching line crashers come |
and go with more than ordinary in- !
terest because I was a genuine fa- ,
natic when it came to rooting lor j
them. But there weren't many of j
them to root for—especially on the j
Coast. Dave Anderson of Cal's great .
1937 outfit was a swell line-crasher!
to watch . . . our own Bobby Gray- '
son was one of the very best ... I
Gus Shaver of U.S.C. and Joe Kee
ble of U.C.L.A. were better than I
ordinary . . . but there weren't
many of them.
However, in our humble opin
ion Stanford has a man this year
that compares with any of those
mentioned above. Naturally we're !
referring to Norm Standlee, who j
powered his way through U.S.C.'s j
line for an average of over four
yards a play while his team was j
taking a 33-0 trouncing.
Against U.C.L.A. Standlee picked '
up over 100 yards by himself, while ;
his 3.6-yard average against j
Washington was postively phenom- |
enal considering the fact that the.'
Husky line was outcharging the In- j
dian forwards and oftentimes Stand- j
lee had to gain five yards to get a !
three-yard gain from scrimmage, so
tar back were the Indian linemen !
charged.
Tomorrow Standlee has a chance j
to go against a team that is perhaps !
the weakest outfit in the conference. 1
The Cougars have a pronounced im
potenee in the line. It looks to us
I that Standlee is in a great spot to
i really do some battering.
And from our safe perch high in
the press box we'll feel for every
poor Cougar who tries to stop him.
CORRESPONDENCE FROM
I HE PINE-TREE LAND
Says Charles Hatley, sports editor
1 of the Washington State Evergreen,
i "The common belief around these
j parts is that if we win one game it
I will surely be against the Indians."
j Mebbc so, Charley, but I have a
hunch that when you defeated
j Washington you won your one game.

| The U.C.L.A. Bruins sharpened their
punting and passing attack tonight in
the last hard workout before Satur
l day's Santa Clara game. Coach Babe
I Horrell said speedy Jackie Robinson
would be used "only in the bust re
