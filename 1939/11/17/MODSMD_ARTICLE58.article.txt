# Card Booters Hope to Stop Unbeaten Bears Tomorrow
## 
### 
Minus the services of Greyson
Bryan, stellar right half, the Card
soccer squad will journey to Berke
ley tomorrow for the lirst game of
a home-and-home series with the
undefeated California Bears.
Bryan twisted his knee in Wed
nesday's S.F.J.C. contest. Hank
Swaflord will take his place in the
starting lineup Swaflord will be the
first sophomore to crash the first
string all season.
CAL LEADS LEAGUE
A win for the Card hooters would
knock Cal out of the league lead.
With an undefeated team, the Bears
are gunning for their fourth suc
cessive conference championship.
In their last two games the Cards
have piled up a total of 15 goals to
a lone score for their opponents. Al
though they have dropped three
league games since opening against
Menlo J.C., no team has tallied more
than two goals against them in a
game. .
FARM DEFENSE TIGHT
Captain Bill Hamilton and Cam
eron Pierce are two of the finest full
backs that have worn Cardinal jer
seys in many a year. With Tito
Sanz-Agero in the nets the Farm
eleven presents a defense that is
well-nigh impregnable.
Sanz-Agero has been hampered for
the last two weeks by an injured
shoulder, but Rudy Munzer has*

pj'oven himself capable of filling in
for the tall Spaniard.
SAME FORWARDS OPEN
The Indian front line will be the
same as that which started against
j San Francisco Wednesday. Chris
! Son turn, the team's high scorer, will
j open at outside left, Al Pellas will
1 be at inside left, Wilson Clark will
[ start at center forward, George Dole
will be at inside right, and Bill
Arrasmith will hold down outside j
| I'ight.
Feeding the ball to the forwards
, will be Kenny Cuihbertson at left
| half, Bill Edwards at center half,
I and Swaflord at right half.
