ervices of Capt. Bob Plate.
On the eve of the "Big Game,'' Plate found himself embedded in a
lccnliar situation which may claim his eligibility, according to Dr. Thomas
Storey. A misunderstanding which caused one of his professors to believe

ihat the reason Plate was
n a subject was the amount ol time
le spent playing water polo, brought
ibout the ruling.
PROFESSOR REPORTS
The professor reported the situa
tion to Dr. Storey, who, in accord
nice with the school policy of not
etting athletics interfere with school
vork, ruled Plate out.
Plate is now seeking to reinstate
limself by straightening out the .situ
ition and proving I hat water polo is
lot the cause of his work in that
particular subject.
RECORDS TO DATE
Meanwhile, California and Stan
ford today will drag out the record
books and get them up to date.
There's a lot of history embedded
in the "Big Game" records. Ol

to form more headlines.
Stanford's team of Bill Bleecker,
Dave Noltage, Bob Allen or Duncan
Patty, Dick Hoover, Ted Moreno and
Frank Dowling or Bill Burns will be
slight favorites.
THE RECORDS
I In conference games, Stanford has
scored eight points to the opposi
tion's IG. California has 17 points to
its credit—to the opposition's 28.
According to Coach Nort Thorn

ton this gives Stanford an advantage
by the losing ratio of 4 to 2 against
7 to 4 for the Golden ones.
But a fact that will have a lot more
bearing on the outcome of this year's
series than history is whether or
not Frank Dowling will be able to
cast aside his week-old crutches for
a position in the Stanford goalie's
net.
The Indian Papooses will start the
game with Dan Dillon at sprint,
Johnny Hauerwass and Jack Bleeclc
er at the forward spots, Ralph Bolles
as center-back, Ritter and
Fred Doan at guards, and Jack Bohr
in the goal.

particular subject.
RECORDS TO DATE
Meanwhile, California and Stan
ford today will drag out the record
books and get them up to date.
There's a lot of history embedded
in the "Big Game" records. Ol
course, none of it will count today
when the '39 editions go to work
to form more headlines.
Stanford's team of Bill Bleecker,
Dave Noltage, Bob Allen or Duncan
Patty, Dick Hoover, Ted Moreno and
Frank Dowling or Bill Burns will be
slight favorites.
THE RECORDS
I In conference games, Stanford has
scored eight points to the opposi
tion's IG. California has 17 points to
its credit—to the opposition's 28.
According to Coach Nort Thorn

ton this gives Stanford an advantage
by the losing ratio of 4 to 2 against
7 to 4 for the Golden ones.
But a fact that will have a lot more
bearing on the outcome of this year's
series than history is whether or
not Frank Dowling will be able to
cast aside his week-old crutches for
a position in the Stanford goalie's
net.
The Indian Papooses will start the
game with Dan Dillon at sprint,
Johnny Hauerwass and Jack Bleeclc
er at the forward spots, Ralph Bolles
as center-back, Ritter and
Fred Doan at guards, and Jack Bohr
in the goal.
Stanford and California water polo teams will clash this afternoon al ;
! o'clock in Encina pool. And the Indians are very likely not to have (he }
ervices of Capt. Bob Plate.
On the eve of the "Big Game,'' Plate found himself embedded in a
lccnliar situation which may claim his eligibility, according to Dr. Thomas
Storey. A misunderstanding which caused one of his professors to believe

ihat the reason Plate was
n a subject was the amount ol time
le spent playing water polo, brought
ibout the ruling.
PROFESSOR REPORTS
The professor reported the situa
tion to Dr. Storey, who, in accord
nice with the school policy of not
etting athletics interfere with school
vork, ruled Plate out.
Plate is now seeking to reinstate
limself by straightening out the .situ
ition and proving I hat water polo is
lot the cause of his work in that
particular subject.
