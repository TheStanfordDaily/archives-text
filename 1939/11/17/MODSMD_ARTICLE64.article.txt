# Paint Brush Warfare
## 
### 
HIGH above the Berkeley campus a great,
yellow, cement "C"is set in a weedy hill
side. An object of little interest throughout
most of the year, suddenly each November it
assumes a peculiar attraction for the freshman
class of Stanford University.
All at once each square inch of its golden
surface temptingly invites the man who dares
to paint it red. And each year a gang of ma
rauders leaves Encina in the dead of night to
paint Cal's Big "C."
To date few injuries and only slight property
damage have resulted from these raids. Frosh
have been held captives in fraternity houses
and have had their heads shaved—and only
once did a Stanford man intentionally injure a
Cal student.
However, the Indians could not expect to con
tinue this sabotage year after year without the
Bears retaliating. Annually, during Big Game
week, the Quad breaks out in a rash of yellow
"Cals" and "C's" are burned in the lawns.
This is as far as the fun has gone to date.
But the situation has dangerous potentialities.
Realizing that such activities eventually might
lead to a break of friendly relations between
Stanford and Cal, three years ago the student
body presidents of both schools signed an
agreement outlawing all raiding and destruc
tion of property, and providing that students
should be informed of the fact in the week
prior to the Big Game.
Unfortunately the authors of the pact did not
foresee that the class of '43 would start its ex
peditions two weeks before the game.
Since they have been reasonably harmless
and conducted in the spirit of innocent fun thus
far, many people feel that the Big "C" raids
should be winked at. And these people are
right—as far as they think.
But they have considered the problem only
in the light of what has happened in the past,
not in regard to what may happen in the future.
Some night an unthinking frosh is going to
go a step too far. Property at Berkeley or on
the Farm is going to be materially damaged.
Or somebody is going to be seriously hurt.
A spirit of resentment will grow up between
the two Universities. They will sever relations.
And finally there will be no Big Game.
The fun of splashing red paint on that yellow
"C" doesn't seem worth the chance.

tinue this sabotage year after year without the
Bears retaliating. Annually, during Big Game
week, the Quad breaks out in a rash of yellow
"Cals" and "C's" are burned in the lawns.
This is as far as the fun has gone to date.
But the situation has dangerous potentialities.
Realizing that such activities eventually might
lead to a break of friendly relations between
Stanford and Cal, three years ago the student
body presidents of both schools signed an
agreement outlawing all raiding and destruc
tion of property, and providing that students
should be informed of the fact in the week
prior to the Big Game.
Unfortunately the authors of the pact did not
foresee that the class of '43 would start its ex
peditions two weeks before the game.
Since they have been reasonably harmless
and conducted in the spirit of innocent fun thus
far, many people feel that the Big "C" raids
should be winked at. And these people are
right—as far as they think.
But they have considered the problem only
in the light of what has happened in the past,
not in regard to what may happen in the future.
Some night an unthinking frosh is going to
go a step too far. Property at Berkeley or on
the Farm is going to be materially damaged.
Or somebody is going to be seriously hurt.
A spirit of resentment will grow up between
the two Universities. They will sever relations.
And finally there will be no Big Game.
The fun of splashing red paint on that yellow
"C" doesn't seem worth the chance.
HIGH above the Berkeley campus a great,
yellow, cement "C"is set in a weedy hill
side. An object of little interest throughout
most of the year, suddenly each November it
assumes a peculiar attraction for the freshman
class of Stanford University.
All at once each square inch of its golden
surface temptingly invites the man who dares
to paint it red. And each year a gang of ma
rauders leaves Encina in the dead of night to
paint Cal's Big "C."
To date few injuries and only slight property
damage have resulted from these raids. Frosh
have been held captives in fraternity houses
and have had their heads shaved—and only
once did a Stanford man intentionally injure a
Cal student.
However, the Indians could not expect to con
tinue this sabotage year after year without the
Bears retaliating. Annually, during Big Game
week, the Quad breaks out in a rash of yellow
"Cals" and "C's" are burned in the lawns.
