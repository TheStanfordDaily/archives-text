ONCE in the history of every great univer
sity a song or a yell is composed in which
is contained the whole essential spirit of the
institution. No subseguent yell ever takes the
place of it, no song ever after expresses its
thought guite so well. The concise words be
come the heart of tradition.
That moment came to Stanford just five yeais
after its founding when, in 1896, Will Irwin,
since famous as an author, and Chris Bradley
collaborated to produce the Axe Yell. They
wrote the yell with intent to murder California
in a baseball game two days later, and in so
doing founded the spirit of which we are still
proud.
Stanford's right in the Axe Yell therefore is
based upon the fact that the yell was written
by Stanford men, that it represents our earliest
tradition, that it was written in defiance of Cali
fornia, then the lion of the state's athletics. No
clearer right could be phrased; a copyright
would be guite superfluous.
But how Stanford's early graduates must
sguirm when they hear every university from
Seattle to Los Angeles plagiarizing the terse,
pointed sentiment, "Give 'Em the Axe!"
No university pilfers the victory songs of its
opponents. For Cardinal rooters to gloat to the
tune of "Bow Down to Washington" would be
meaningless as well as in poor taste.
Yet the victory-mad Huskies gave the Axe
Yell when Stanford met them a few weeks
ago.
Perhaps the fact that the yell does not include
the word "Stanford" makes it too readily adapt
able for other rooting sections. It is so worded,
unfortunately, that technically it can bo used

anywhere by anybody. But in spite of the
adaptability ol the yell, the principle holds true
that it does not mean anything to any university
but Stanford, and it is ridiculous for them to
use it.
Stanford's tradition is the story of a great
university springing up in a few short years. It
Is the story of early struggle for things which
today we take for granted.
The Axe Yell was the expression of sudden
coming •of • age, a demand for respect from
rival universities, a shout of defiance at those
smugly established institutions.
Now those universities have recognized Stan
ford by stealing the Axe Yell. All we can do
is ask them to desist. If they refuse, may they
know v/e think them no sportsmen.—J. B.

able for other rooting sections. It is so worded,
unfortunately, that technically it can bo used

anywhere by anybody. But in spite of the
adaptability ol the yell, the principle holds true
that it does not mean anything to any university
but Stanford, and it is ridiculous for them to
use it.
Stanford's tradition is the story of a great
university springing up in a few short years. It
Is the story of early struggle for things which
today we take for granted.
The Axe Yell was the expression of sudden
coming •of • age, a demand for respect from
rival universities, a shout of defiance at those
smugly established institutions.
Now those universities have recognized Stan
ford by stealing the Axe Yell. All we can do
is ask them to desist. If they refuse, may they
know v/e think them no sportsmen.—J. B.
ONCE in the history of every great univer
sity a song or a yell is composed in which
is contained the whole essential spirit of the
institution. No subseguent yell ever takes the
place of it, no song ever after expresses its
thought guite so well. The concise words be
come the heart of tradition.
That moment came to Stanford just five yeais
after its founding when, in 1896, Will Irwin,
since famous as an author, and Chris Bradley
collaborated to produce the Axe Yell. They
wrote the yell with intent to murder California
in a baseball game two days later, and in so
doing founded the spirit of which we are still
proud.
Stanford's right in the Axe Yell therefore is
based upon the fact that the yell was written
by Stanford men, that it represents our earliest
tradition, that it was written in defiance of Cali
fornia, then the lion of the state's athletics. No
clearer right could be phrased; a copyright
would be guite superfluous.
But how Stanford's early graduates must
sguirm when they hear every university from
Seattle to Los Angeles plagiarizing the terse,
pointed sentiment, "Give 'Em the Axe!"
No university pilfers the victory songs of its
opponents. For Cardinal rooters to gloat to the
tune of "Bow Down to Washington" would be
meaningless as well as in poor taste.
Yet the victory-mad Huskies gave the Axe
Yell when Stanford met them a few weeks
ago.
Perhaps the fact that the yell does not include
the word "Stanford" makes it too readily adapt
able for other rooting sections. It is so worded,
unfortunately, that technically it can bo used

anywhere by anybody. But in spite of the
adaptability ol the yell, the principle holds true
that it does not mean anything to any university
but Stanford, and it is ridiculous for them to
use it.
