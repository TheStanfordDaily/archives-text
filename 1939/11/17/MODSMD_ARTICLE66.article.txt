STIC KS AND STONES
i *NE of the Daily's more enterprising investigators
thought he could help undated men and undated
women by pointing out that there are dateless indi
viduals of both sexes. His theory was obvious: if men
without dates know that there are women without
dates, the men will get dates with the women, and
everyone will bo contented. Like so many neat eco
nomic theories counting on the rationality of the con
sumer, the Daily investigator was wrong. His plan
was much too sensible.
All he has succeeded in doing is getting the females
to stick their tongues out at the males, and vice-versa.
Now the picture of collegiate tongues being stuck
out at one another may not be all that could be do
sired from a standpoint of manners. And the mass
display of tongue-defiance may also be a sad com
mentary on collegiate reason. But it nevertheless pre
sents a highly intriguing comedy, in the eyes of any
one, as usual, except the comedians.
When confronted with the statistical evidence that
they are undated, women obviously feel called upon
to defend themselves. This procedure may not get
them dates, but it will nevertheless preserve their
dignity. And dignity is a thing which a woman can
not afford to lose. Her freedom, yes. But her dignity,
never.

jVOW the- men, on the other hand, cannot refrain
from pointing out to (he women that their dateless
state of chagrin is their own fault. If you weren't so
snooty, they defiantly accuse, you would have dates.
Oh. is that so, the not-to-be-outdone females retort.
Well, we have too got dates, mister smarty. So there!
The full beauty of this impasse will not be revealed
until Big Game night, when the still-dignified women
will still be dateless, and the analytical stags will slip
off for refreshments together and discuss the impla
cable irony of the woman-situation at Stanford. How
much more reasonable is this procedure than getting
dates is perfectly clear. The women still have their
dignity; the men have the gratification of feeling re
bellious. And nothing is lostâ€”except dates.
Some groups on the campus are so naively optimis
tic that they are vainly trying to start a date bureau.
It seems to me it would Im> a much more practical
procedure for the women to start a Preservation of
Feminine Dignity League. And for the men to found
a Society for the Reform of Stanford Women. Then
both organizations could get together at bi-monthly
"affairs." Instead of dancing on such occasions they
could line up on opposite sides of the room and, Jit a
signal from a neutral party, stick out their tongues at
one another.
Suitable music, of course, would have to be supplied.
