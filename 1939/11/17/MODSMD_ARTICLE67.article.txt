WHO'S GOT THE AXE YELL?

r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
Now that football fever h;is overcome practically
everyone on campus, I wonder if this isn t the time to
bring up the subject of the Axe Yell—particularly as
it applies to Big Game. At least, if we desire that Ca!
should not Rive that yell during the game, now is the
time to do something about it.
I believe we should decide whether the yell i.s our
ollicial yell, and so belongs to us alone, or whether it
is a Big Game yell going with the Axe, or whether it
is anyone's. If the first decision is reached, then our
yell leaders or someone else with authority should
meet with tin? appropriate persons at Cal and come to
a gentleman's agreement on the matter. If either of
the other two decisions is made, then this campus
should be told, so that they will know what to expect
at the game.
But at least let's not muddle along as we have be
fore, and have our whole rooting section made furious,
and our cheering program thrown off balance, by
the other school's use of a yell which most of us at
present feel they have no right to. Being angered in
that manner does not creale the kind of sportsman
ship which either Stanford or Cal desires.

EDITOR, SIR:
Each year al Big Game bonfire time, Enema's
frosh pry quantities of pickets from the bannisters
in order to beat off anticipated invaders. And each
year, these pickets must be painstakingly replaced by
carpenters. The frosh. of course, pay for both the
pickets and the labor.
Why doesn't the Class of '43 exercise a little fore
sight and save itself some cash by buying its clubs
before the bonfire instead of after it? For a small
sum, the class could buy enough clubs to supply each
member with one, either from the corporation yard
or from a local lumber company. Why pay the extra
amount required to pay several carpenters for a week's
work?
Sincerely,
W. H. Buell

r rHE EDITOH, SIK:
When McllinkofT says the Republican Parly is "a
little outmoded in this day and age perhaps," ho indi
cates that he is a little outmoded, and no PERHAPS.
Mr. M.'s viewpoint died in the last national election —
they just haven't made it lie down yet. II was a sickly
brat of a viewpoint even before that—the brainchild
of another Mr. M.—now forgotten—l believe his name
was Michelson.
Master M.'s ad hominem criticisms are unfortu
nately more applicable to the Democrats, whose "lead
ers," having the opportunities, have done more to harm
this country than Mr. Hoover didn't do to keep it
from harm.
Mr. M. may well be opposing a Republican drive as
a matter of self-defense. The lightning rod should
not be on his typewriter. Mr. M. is entitled to his own
opinion, thank God. but I hope henceforth he will he
intellectually honest when he makes any attempt to
foisf that opinion on others.
