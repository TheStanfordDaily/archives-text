• THE TAMING OF THE SHREW' now playing at the Curran in San
Francisco.
William Shakespeare must have a distant cousin who writes The
Bungles, for it is downright amazing—this startling similarity between
George and Ju of the comics and Pctruchio and Katherine in the current
play.
Of course the stage midgets throw no squiteh, nor are there any dia
monds on the theater floor, hul "The Taming of the Shrew" with Alfred!

Lunt and Lynn Fontanne has a
magic power all of its own. It would
probably please the old master no
end if he could sec the Lunts fight,
play, and stooge in the true Eliza
bethan manner.
For years the true comedy value
of "The Shrew" has been covered
with the dust of convention. Too
many analysts have avoided the
town drunk, the slap-happy midgets,
in fact the whole colossal jest.
But the Lunts, even down to Al
fred's somewhat east-sidish brogue,
are not ones to quibble with conven
tion when there is fun to be had.
You sit there feeling like you've
walked in on a high-class burlesque,
and it's an extremely pleasant
change. The greatest acting pair on
the American stage and their cast
of 45 seem to be just as happily en
grossed in their pioneering venture.
The Bungles are sissies in compari
son; Zooie and 800 Hoo are just a
couple of rank amateurs.
If there was a serious moment in
the embroglio, these study-worn
eyes must have missed it. But cer
tainly no one was offended and
Shakespeare ought to he sleeping
like a little lamb now that someone
has discovered the true essence of
his humor.—Jenks
