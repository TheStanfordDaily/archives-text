# Stoessel Trapped in Europe; Writes Impressions of War
## Debater Sends Ideas via Airmail; Gives Personal Opinions of Crisis 
### WALT STOESSEL 
Since the outbreak of the war, America has been virtually bom- !
barded with news-stories, feature articles, wild-eyed rumors and the j
like on the "actual" situation in Europe. As a former Stanford stu- 1
dent living in Switzerland, and at the risk of repeating things with
which most America is all too familiar, I would like to add some of

my own personal observations to
the tremendous mass of war mate
rial already in circulation.
Switzerland is a country which
rarely enters the conversation when
ever the subject of the "European
situation" is brought up. Neverthe-

less, by virtue of its geographic lo
cation alone, it assumes in time of
war a position of some importance
[ on the European scene. The coun
t try is central, neutral, and in many
I ways much like an island in the
J midst of a storm-tossed sea.
AGENTS' REFUGE
A natural for the espionage activ
; ity of both sides, at. present writing
j the country is literally seething with
I foreign agents, intrigue and counter
j intrigue—despite strenuous precau
: tionary measures taken by the gov-
I eminent. It Ls a center for Rod
! Cross activities, and when the "real
I fighting" begins, it will become—as
'it did in the last great war—a hospi
! tal for all Europe.
Newspapers and radio broadcasts
: in Switzerland are freer from propa
ganda, I believe than in any other
i European country—although I do
think that people in the United
| States know almost as much about
| what is going on in Europe as we in
Switzerland do, because of strin
j gent censorship laws which now pre- i
{ vail in every European country.
The Swiss army is completely
j mobilized—but other than that, liv
ing conditions are fairly normal.
The only things which remind us of
the nearness of war are our ration |
cards for food, and a few air-raid
j and bombing precautions.
ARMY READY
"Business as usual" is the order
' of the day, and the civil population
| is quite calm — although one feels
and senses almost everywhere an
j undercurrent of nervous tension,
j The main worry of the Swiss is that
there are a few hundred thousand
! Germans massed on the frontier
i above Basel and Schaffhausen, who
! might very possibly prefer to get at
I the Allies by way of the Swiss cen
tral plateau and over the low-lying !
Jura mountains, rather than try and
crack up the Maginot Line,
jCHANCES GOOD
i I was in Basel and Schaffhausen i
| the 30th and 31st of October. Both '
towns have been almost completely
evacuated, and Basel particularly is '
a huge and seemingly impregnable I
, fortress. Although the worthy Swiss I
burghers wouldn't be at all sur- j
prised to wake up some morning to i
j see German tanks rattling through ;
i the streets and to learn that, their j
I cherished neutrality had been vio- :
lated as a "precautionary measure," j
I hope and believe that Switzerland j
j will escape such a fate.
If the Germans do choose to at- I
| tack through a neutral country, and j
it is likely that they will, all signs'

as I write seem to point to Holland
as the logical victim. Switzerland is
strongly fortified, for one thing"—and
the central plateau, while easy to
pass through, might well prove a
cul de sac which would be a dis
astrous trap for the German forces.
Nevertheless, the Swiss are still
worrying about the possibility.
Blackouts have been effected many
times—and civilian exercises against
poison gas and air raids are fre
quent.
REPORTS DIFFER
Almost all radio programs from
both England and Germany are en
tirely propaganda—and some of it
from both sides is pretty "raw stuff."
I have some friends in Germany
who give me interesting angles on
the real conditions in that country,
and they are greatly different from
the English reports on the same sub
ject.
Of course, all German citizens are
more or less "encouraged" to write
favorable reports, but nevertheless I
feel that current English reports on
the results in Germany of the food
blockade are exaggerated. More and
more I am beginning to doubt the
efficacy of a policy of "starving
Germany to defeat," Germany has
been preparing for this war for a
long time, and the food reserves in
the country are tremendous.
The German people, too, are pos
sessed of tremendous tenacity, will
power and moral reserve, and they
will not be easy to "starve out."
From talks I have had with people
recently returned from Germany,
there is no "fighting in the streets

j for food," all stores are open, the-
I aters and cafes show no slack in
business—and every effort is being
made to keep living conditions as
normal as possible.
Germany's amazing organization
is well illustrated by the fact that
trains and mail are still running on
schedule, and that there was no
j confusion following the actual dec
i laration of war. Almost the opposite
; is true in France, where for the first
| month 50 million Frenchmen went
' nuts to the strains of the "Mar
[ seillaise," and train and mail service
is still one awful mess.
FUEHRER CONDEMNED
Of course, almost all German
citizens believe implicitly that Po
land was a dangerous menace to
Germany, that the English have
spurned the generous peace offers
jof their Fuehrer without reason,
| that England provoked the war with
i Germany because the latter was a
| menace to Great Britain's world -
I dominating imperialism, and that
j they have no other course left open
i but than to fight in self-defense.
What a terrible thing it is when a
j whole nation loses the power of in
| dividual reasoning and thinking!
; It's one thing to read about, and
| quite another — infinitely more
| shocking—thing when one comes in j
actual contact with the reality.

Switzerland is a country which
rarely enters the conversation when

cation alone, it assumes in time of
war a position of some importance
[ on the European scene. The coun

my own personal observations to

rial already in circulation.
Switzerland is a country which
rarely enters the conversation when
ever the subject of the "European
situation" is brought up. Neverthe-

less, by virtue of its geographic lo
cation alone, it assumes in time of
war a position of some importance
[ on the European scene. The coun
t try is central, neutral, and in many
I ways much like an island in the
J midst of a storm-tossed sea.
