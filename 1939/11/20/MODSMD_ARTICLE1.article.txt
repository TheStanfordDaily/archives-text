### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
I OUIS XVI was in his shop, tin
kering with locks, and Marie
Antoinette hadn't even thought of
feeding cake to the masses. The
cauldron of hatred that bubbled
over in the I 1 rench Revolution was
only simmering; Europe had to wait
13 years for the bloody storming of
the Bastille.
But in international law, the
French government set a precedent
that, for 153 years, has guided the
policy of nations at war on the sea.
That precedent, forgotten sometimes
for years, came to the attention of
the world again yesterday as Great
Britain and France proclaimed the
fact that their naval fleets will treat
as "enemy craft" any German mer
chant ships transferred to Russia
and flying the hammer and sickle
emblem.

The warning followed Scandina
vian reports that Russia has pur
chased a number of German vessels,
including the $20,000,000 Nazi liner
Bremen, and would pay for them by
deliveries of war materials and
other products to Germany. Le
Temps, France's conservative, semi
official daily, analyzed the Allies'
doctrine for dealing with such a
situation by quoting the July, 1776,
ruling that said:
* * *
wwCIHPS of enemy construction
or owned by enemy proprie
tors will not be considered neutral
or allied if several authentic docu
ments established in the presence
of public officers are not found
aboard to prove that the date of
sale or transfer was made to sub
jects of allied or neutral powers
before the commencement of hos- I
tilities."
Commenting on the 153-year-old
doctrine, Le Temps predicted that
an attempt "to transfer ships from
the German to the Soviet flag would
immediately encounter absolute ju
ridical and military veto by Britain
and France."
The French government rigidly
enforced this doctrine throughout
the 19th century and during the
Crimean War Napoleon 111 or
dered the capture of all Russian
merchantmen which the Czar's
government sold or transferred to
neutral powers. Britain and
France haven't always agreed
alntut the issue as happily as they
do now. For a time they were at
\ "aria nee on the enforcement of
the doctrine, but a compromise
was reached under Article No. 56
of the 1909 London Conference.
* * *
r |" , HE compromise stated, rather
clearly, that "the transfer of an
enemy ship to a neutral flag after
the opening of hostilities is null and
void unless it can be established that
said transfer did not take place with
the aim of eluding the consequences
attached to the character of an en
emy vessel."
By the time of World War, I,
France and England had ironed out
all disagreements over naval policy.
In January, 1915, the British and
French governments announced
that they were ready to enforce the
doctrine against Germany's reported
intention of transferring to another
power 546,607 tons of shipping
blocked in New York, Baltimore,
and Boston.
Yesterday's dispatches telling of
the transfer of the Bremen to the
Soviets, presumably for use in a
new service from Murmansk to
New York, raised the issue again.
Serious international complications
might very well develop.
Even though Norwegian dispatches
said the Soviets were taking over
the German liner New York, later
reports said the ship left the Soviet,
arctic port, of Murmansk on Nov. 4
for Germany, by way of Norwegian
and Swedish territorial waters.
