# Invaders Burn In Campus Lawn
## 
### 
Invaders, allegedly from the Uni
versity of California, last night
burned a large "C" in the lawn at
the upper end of Palm Drive and
attempted to burn another one on
the lawn in front of Roble Hall.
The attempted lettering of the
Roble lawn was interrupted when
two Stanford men chased away the
invaders and stamped out the fire,
which was set with small strips of
wax spread out on the lawn.
