### WALT STOESSEL 
(This is the second of three ar- j
tirles by a prominent Stanford un- 1
dergraduate, now interned in 1
Lausanne. Switzerland, by the Eu
ropean war.)
Italy remains a huge question |
mark in European affairs. I returned I
Oct. 22 from a month's traveling in J
Italy and in Albania, and came back
convinced that Italy herself does not
know what part she will play in the
war. Certainly, Mussolini does not
want to enter the war, as Italy
stands to make a tremendous profit
on war trade if she can stay neutral; |
but it is a question just how strongly
he is bound to Hitler and Hitler's
orders.
The Rome-Berlin axis is a polit- j
ical arrangement only and certainly ,
no "band of steel'—as I found that j
the average Italian hates the Ger- I
mans with a depth of passion which i
only a Latin could achieve. I think '
that Mussolini would be courting a 1
revolution if he decided to throw in
with Hitler at the present moment, i
Although it is dangerous to make i
predictions, it appears likely that.
Italy will attempt to form some sort j

of Balkan neutrality bloc, and that
Mussolini will remain sitting on the
fence just as long as possible.

was naturally welcomed with great
enthusiasm by France and England

or less certain, I imagine the final
vote came as a great relief to the
two countries.
Many Europeans seem to think it
now only a question of time until
America will enter the war, since
we have so definitely committed
ourselves to the Allied cause. Amer

despite English communiques to the
contrary, appear to be having some
trouble with the German airmen.
America now will assume the po
sition in relation to the Allies

I Russia will take for them —that of a
j huge storehouse of the raw materials
of war. and also, and very import -
I ant—a source of money and credit.
Russia, as always, is an enigma.
