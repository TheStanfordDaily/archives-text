### WALT STOESSEL 
(This is the second of three ar- j
tirles by a prominent Stanford un- 1
dergraduate, now interned in 1
Lausanne. Switzerland, by the Eu
ropean war.)
Italy remains a huge question |
mark in European affairs. I returned I
Oct. 22 from a month's traveling in J
Italy and in Albania, and came back
convinced that Italy herself does not
know what part she will play in the
war. Certainly, Mussolini does not
want to enter the war, as Italy
stands to make a tremendous profit
on war trade if she can stay neutral; |
but it is a question just how strongly
he is bound to Hitler and Hitler's
orders.
The Rome-Berlin axis is a polit- j
ical arrangement only and certainly ,
no "band of steel'—as I found that j
the average Italian hates the Ger- I
mans with a depth of passion which i
only a Latin could achieve. I think '
that Mussolini would be courting a 1
revolution if he decided to throw in
with Hitler at the present moment, i
Although it is dangerous to make i
predictions, it appears likely that.
Italy will attempt to form some sort j

of Balkan neutrality bloc, and that
Mussolini will remain sitting on the
fence just as long as possible.
The repeal of the embargo act
was naturally welcomed with great
enthusiasm by France and England

►and, although (ho outcome was more
or less certain, I imagine the final
vote came as a great relief to the
two countries.
Many Europeans seem to think it
now only a question of time until
America will enter the war, since
we have so definitely committed
ourselves to the Allied cause. Amer
ican planes, in particular, should he
of great support to the Allies, who,
despite English communiques to the
contrary, appear to be having some
trouble with the German airmen.
America now will assume the po
sition in relation to the Allies
l which the Germans evidently hope
I Russia will take for them —that of a
j huge storehouse of the raw materials
of war. and also, and very import -
I ant—a source of money and credit.
Russia, as always, is an enigma.
| But it does seem that, even if she
I does not intervene in a military way
; on Germany's side, she will provide
■ Germany with food and raw mate
' rials. Already, some exchanges have
; been made, and work is in progress
i to facilitate railroad communication
i between the two countries — made

difficult because of different gauge
sizes in the railroad system.
It has been evident for some time
that Turkey's sudden move into the
Allied fold was a bitter pill for Rus
sia to swallow—and it was obviously
a complete and disappointing sur
prise to the strategists of the Krem
lin.
In war-torn Europe, America is
regarded as a powerful moral force
for peace and democracy, which
force can only act to discourage Ger
many and give a sustaining drive to
the Allies. Roosevelt is regarded as
a great apostle of peace, and there is
some hope here that he may step
in eventually as a mediator and, in
some miraculous way, put an end to
the whole fracas.
To the average man over here,
Roosevelt represents what might be
called a "New Deal" (pardon!) in
international affairs, and in many
circles he is confidently expected to
do something about the situation —
although no one knows just what.
To the European, the repeal of the
embargo act seems only the begin
ning of America's fight for law and
order in a sick world.

Italy remains a huge question |
mark in European affairs. I returned I
Oct. 22 from a month's traveling in J
Italy and in Albania, and came back
convinced that Italy herself does not
know what part she will play in the
war. Certainly, Mussolini does not
want to enter the war, as Italy
stands to make a tremendous profit
on war trade if she can stay neutral; |
but it is a question just how strongly
he is bound to Hitler and Hitler's
orders.
The Rome-Berlin axis is a polit- j
ical arrangement only and certainly ,
no "band of steel'—as I found that j
the average Italian hates the Ger- I
mans with a depth of passion which i
only a Latin could achieve. I think '
that Mussolini would be courting a 1
revolution if he decided to throw in
with Hitler at the present moment, i
Although it is dangerous to make i
predictions, it appears likely that.
Italy will attempt to form some sort j

of Balkan neutrality bloc, and that
Mussolini will remain sitting on the
fence just as long as possible.
The repeal of the embargo act
was naturally welcomed with great
enthusiasm by France and England

►and, although (ho outcome was more
or less certain, I imagine the final
vote came as a great relief to the
two countries.
Many Europeans seem to think it
now only a question of time until
America will enter the war, since
we have so definitely committed
ourselves to the Allied cause. Amer
ican planes, in particular, should he
of great support to the Allies, who,
despite English communiques to the
contrary, appear to be having some
trouble with the German airmen.
America now will assume the po
sition in relation to the Allies
l which the Germans evidently hope
I Russia will take for them —that of a
j huge storehouse of the raw materials
of war. and also, and very import -
I ant—a source of money and credit.
Russia, as always, is an enigma.

I does not intervene in a military way

' rials. Already, some exchanges have

i between the two countries — made

difficult because of different gauge
sizes in the railroad system.
It has been evident for some time
that Turkey's sudden move into the
Allied fold was a bitter pill for Rus

a complete and disappointing sur
prise to the strategists of the Krem

In war-torn Europe, America is
regarded as a powerful moral force
for peace and democracy, which
force can only act to discourage Ger
many and give a sustaining drive to
the Allies. Roosevelt is regarded as
a great apostle of peace, and there is
some hope here that he may step
in eventually as a mediator and, in
some miraculous way, put an end to
the whole fracas.
To the average man over here,
Roosevelt represents what might be
called a "New Deal" (pardon!) in
international affairs, and in many
circles he is confidently expected to
do something about the situation —
although no one knows just what.
