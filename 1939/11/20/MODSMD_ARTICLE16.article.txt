HYDE PARK, N.Y., Nov. 19 (UP).
â€” President Roosevelt, laying the
cornerstone of a $350,000 library
which will house his personal papers,
digressed from his speech today to
comment sardonically on newspa
per writers who have speculated on
the posibility he may seek a third
term.
Mr. Roosevelt dedicated the li
brary to world peace, before a crowd
of 1,500 spectators which included
Federal Security Administrator Paul
V. McNutt, who admittedly is seek
ing the 1940 Democratic nomination
for President.
Some newspaper stories had been
written seeking to read third-term
significance into the fact that Mr.
Roosevelt's plans for the library call
for him to make his personal papers
public only a year after the end of
his second term.
