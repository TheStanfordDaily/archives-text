Will B. Ellington, iVho has held the position of associate director <>f
track and field athletics at Stanford since 1927, was officially confirmed af>
acting head coach for the remainder of the academic year at a B.A.CU
meeting last Friday night.
Also under discussion was the possible construction of the long-sought
bleachers for Aiigell Field. It was decided to postpone action on this sub-

>ject until the financial situation of
the B.A.C. is more settled.
Ellington replaces Robert Lyman
("Dink") Templeton, who is at pres
ent on a leave of absence, his con
tract as track director expiring in
September 1940.
ft was also announced at the meet
ing that Alfred R. Masters, general
manager of the 8.A.C., und Dr.
Thomas A. Storey, head of the de
partment of physical education and
hygiene, will go East during the
Christmas holidays to interview pos
sible candidates to succeed Temple
ton next year.
After coaching for several years
at Kingsburg High School in Yuba
City, Calif., Ellington came to Stan
ford in 1926 to get his degree. He
became a close friend of Templeton
and the latter asked him to stay at
Stanford as assistant coach. Elling
ton has been coaching the Indian
frosh track teams since then.
CAME HERE IN 1027
In 1927, his first year here, Elling
| ton took t,he Stanford track squad
East for the I.C.A.A.A.A. meet, while
from 1931 to 1933 he took over the
head coaching i*eins while Temple
ton was confined by illness.
Concerning the oft - discussed
bleachers for Angell Field, Pro
fessor James B. Wells of the civil
engineering department presented
plans and price estimates for three
different types of construction.
TO SEAT 15,000
According to Wells' plans the
seating capacity would be 15,000
persons in two stands, one running
along each straightaway. The Board
considered the erection of but one
stand, with a 7,500 capacity.
The plans and prices disclosed by
Professor Wells, with prices includ
ing the cost of two stands, were as
follows: a wood frame construction
costing $108,000; second, wood with
a steel underframe, $111,000; all
steel stands, $91,307.
FAVOR STEEL STANDS
The latter type was favored by
the Board because of its lower price
and greater durability. The reason
for the cheaper cost of the all-steel
construction was advanced as being
because the Virginia Bridge Com
pany, who would erect the all-steel
stands, has a special fabricated steel
| available, and also because this type
of stand would do away with exoibi
tant costs for painting and bolting
the wood.
The physics and aeronautics de
partments have both made tests
which disclose that, there would Im
no head-winds caused by the new
bleachers, only cross-winds which
would not affect the times of I hÂ«-
runners, according to Professor
Wells.
However, the discussion was
shelved until a later date when the
B.A.C.'s financial condition could be
more completely evaluated.
