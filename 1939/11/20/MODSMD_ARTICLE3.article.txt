# Five Ships Sent Down Off England
## British Claim Nazis Planted Mines To Sink Neutral Vessels 
### 
LONDON, Nov. 19 (UP). —Five
more ships were reported tonight to
have been sunk off the English coast
by mines, and the British Admiralty,
blaming Germany, said at least four
of them went down in circumstances
"similar" to the sinking of the Dutch
passenger vessel Simon Bolivar with
its loss of possibly 140 or 150 lives.
The five ships included four neu
tral vessels—ltalian, Swedish, Lithu
anian and Jugoslav. There was loss
of life aboard at least thx-ee of them.
The British Admiralty, listing four
of the new sinkings in a communi
que, said German mines planted in
"utter disregard" of international
law were responsible for the wave
of merchant and passenger ship
losses.
GERMANS BLAME BRITISH
Germany in turn blamed Britain
for the Simon Bolivar tragedy,
wfiit-h occurred Saturday almost
within sight of the English coast.
The new sinkings announced by
the Admiralty in a communique
were:
1. The 637-ton Jugoslav freighter
Carica Milica, out of Dubrobnik,
sunk this afternoon ofF the east coast.
The fate of the crew was not re
vealed.
2. The 5,857-ton Italian merchant
ship Grazia, out of Genoa, sunk early
today about five miles off the east
coast with a loss of five lives.
3. The 15,86-ton Swedish vessel
Doborjesson, sunk off the English
coast; seven members of her 20-man
crew missing.
4. The 2,492-ton British merchant
ship Blackhill, out of Newcastle,
sunk Saturday; twenty-two men
were rescued.
LITHUANIAN SHIP DOWN
In addition, a 1,530-ton Lithuanian
freighter, the Taunas, en route to
England without cargo, went down
Saturday in the English Channel
after striking a mine. One of its
crew of 17 was lost and the others
were landed at Zeebrugge, Belgium.
A gale along the Belgian coast
ripped many mines from their moor
ings and tossed them up on the sea
coast.
One of these "escaped" mines ex
ploded against the breakwater at
Breedene, Belgium, at 4:45 p.m. to
day, breaking the windows of a
military hospital in Ostend, three
miles away, the Exchange Telegraph
Agency reported. Another exploded
on the beach at Duyne, causing
damage.
Many floating German mines, cut
from their moorings by the gale, also
were reported to have been washed
up on (he British coast.
British authorities, disputing the
German claims, said that British
mines could not have sunk the Si
mon Bolivar and the other vessels
because when British mines break
loose they automatically are ren
dered unexplodable.
A mounting toll of dead and miss
ing indicated tonight that the sinking
of the Simon Bolivar, ripped to
picces by two mines while men,
women and children were "tossed
about like ten pins," might rank as
the worst civilian ship tragedy thus
far in the war.
A survivors' list issued by the
agents of the ship's owners indi
cated (hat about 150 passengers and
members of the crew were unac
counted for nearly 36 hours after
the disaster.

LITHUANIAN SHIP DOWN
In addition, a 1,530-ton Lithuanian
freighter, the Taunas, en route to
England without cargo, went down
Saturday in the English Channel
after striking a mine. One of its
crew of 17 was lost and the others
were landed at Zeebrugge, Belgium.
A gale along the Belgian coast
ripped many mines from their moor
ings and tossed them up on the sea
coast.
One of these "escaped" mines ex
ploded against the breakwater at
Breedene, Belgium, at 4:45 p.m. to
day, breaking the windows of a
military hospital in Ostend, three
miles away, the Exchange Telegraph
Agency reported. Another exploded
on the beach at Duyne, causing
damage.
Many floating German mines, cut
from their moorings by the gale, also
were reported to have been washed
up on (he British coast.
British authorities, disputing the
German claims, said that British
mines could not have sunk the Si
mon Bolivar and the other vessels
because when British mines break
loose they automatically are ren
dered unexplodable.
A mounting toll of dead and miss
ing indicated tonight that the sinking
of the Simon Bolivar, ripped to
picces by two mines while men,
women and children were "tossed
about like ten pins," might rank as
the worst civilian ship tragedy thus
far in the war.
A survivors' list issued by the
agents of the ship's owners indi
cated (hat about 150 passengers and
members of the crew were unac
counted for nearly 36 hours after
the disaster.
LONDON, Nov. 19 (UP). —Five
more ships were reported tonight to
have been sunk off the English coast
by mines, and the British Admiralty,

of them went down in circumstances
"similar" to the sinking of the Dutch
passenger vessel Simon Bolivar with
its loss of possibly 140 or 150 lives.
The five ships included four neu
tral vessels—ltalian, Swedish, Lithu
anian and Jugoslav. There was loss
of life aboard at least thx-ee of them.
The British Admiralty, listing four
of the new sinkings in a communi
que, said German mines planted in
"utter disregard" of international
law were responsible for the wave
of merchant and passenger ship
losses.
GERMANS BLAME BRITISH

for the Simon Bolivar tragedy,
wfiit-h occurred Saturday almost
