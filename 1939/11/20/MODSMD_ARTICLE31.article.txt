# Zetes, Firehouse Clash Today For Intramural Title
## Grid Finale Pits Power Vs. Finesse Undefeated Sevens Begin Contest at 4:30 On Intramural Field 
### DON SELBY 
Today is Intramural Big Game J
day.
After several weeks of regular !
league games the climax of Stan
ford's football season arrives today i
when Zeta Psi matches gridiron :
skill with the Firehouse in the final
game for the grid crawn of the !
University at 4:30 o'clock on the in
tramural field.
Both the Zctes and the Firehouse \
boys have rolled through all their
games to date without a set-back, j
but one of those teams is going to
have to yield today. The game can
not be tied, because if the score is j
tied at the end of the regular play
ing period, victory goes to the team
which gains the most yardage in an
extra period during which each >
team alternates on offense for ten j
plays.
ZETES HAVE POWER
The Zetes, with a big and powerful
team, have an offense that doesn't
appear well planned, but one which :
has proved to be very effective. Good
blocking and "Cootie" Thompson's
pitching arm are the two factors
which have brought the Zctes to
the finals.
Most* of the time on offense, i
Thompson, behind deadly blocking,
takes his time and lets go with a
bullet-like pass to Hawkins or
Simpson. The rest of the time the
Zetes send Thompson around end or j
speedy little Frank Tatum through
the middle. It's an attack that has
produced plenty of touchdowns.
The Firehouse, on the other hand, |
has a varied and flashy attack which
has run up big scores against some
tough opposition. The key man in j
their offense is versatile Monte Pfyl,
who is a pass tosser de luxe as well
as a fast and tricky runner. On the
receiving end of a good number of
Monte's passes is brother Frank
Pfyl.
PI'YLS STAR
In the Pfyl brothers, Jimmy Mc-
Cloud, and Tom Collins, the Fire
house has four boys who have
played plenty of football, and the
team is made up of a gang who
play ball for keeps.
Whether the smooth Firehouse of
fense can match the powerful Zete
attack is a question that will be an
swered definitely this afternoon.
No matter which way you look at
today's battle it's strictly an even
up proposition.
The line-ups: Zeta Psi—ends, Bill
Lee and Bill Hawkins; guard. Dick
Simpson; center, Derrol Huddelson;
backs, Quentin Thompson, Frank
Tatum, and Howard Hickingbotham.
Firehouse—ends, Charles Graham
