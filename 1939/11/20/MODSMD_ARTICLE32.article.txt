## 
### 
In a contest featured by rough
rifling and spills, Stanford's poloists j
came back to even their Utah series j
with a 3-2 win Saturday morning. I
Coining on the heels of their defeat j
by the Utes last Thursday, it was !
the Indian's first victory of the j
season.
After two scoreless chukkers in'
which a Stanford goal was disal- ;
lowed, the Cards tallied twice in I
the third to take the lead. Joe,
Smith drew first blood on a solo
dash from midfield and Len Weisen
burg banged through a set-up from !
30 yards out.
All th(> Utah goals were scored in j
(lie last period. Dave Boles pushed I
the ball in from a melee. But Smith
got. tin assist from his pony, who
straightened out a pass from Gale
Medlicott, to score Stanford's win
ning point and Capt. Pat Fenton's
last-minute goal for the visitors j
was just an afterthought.
Medlicott and Art Prade \Vere
injured by falls early in the contest
but both were able to finish the
game and will be ready to play
