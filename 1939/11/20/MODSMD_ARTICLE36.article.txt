# Bears Sink Card Waterdogs In First of Big Game Series
## 
### 
California left Stanford's water polo hopes at the bottom of Encina
Pool last Friday. . i
This Wednesday—with another whack at the Bears —the Indians will j
try and pick them up. But the chances aren't exactly bright—how could ]
they be when the Cal varsity took a surprisingly easy 5-1 victory after j

the Cubs had disposed of the
ooses 7 to 5 in the first games of j
the annual series?
It all happened suddenly. The j
Bears' Perry Lamb went wild to I
take advantage of a demoralized j
Stanford varsity in the second half j
and after that the Bears couldn't be •
touched by the ragged Indians.
TEAM DESPAIRS
It was discouraging to see the,
passing of what once promised to j
be a fine Card seven go to pieces in j
desperation.
Actually, in the first half, things j
went according to Hoyle. Stanford
was outscored 2 to 1. but still out- ;
played its opponents. The Bears only
took the lead when Ted Moreno was
tossed from the water leaving the
winners with a free man.
Aronson scored two of California's
points while Lamb was handling the
rest. Bill Bleecker scored Stanford's
lone digit.
PLATE PLAYS
Captain Bob Plate was allowed to
play, and will probably see action
again Wednesday when the Cards
play at Berkeley.
The yearling game in the prelimi
nary gave a foretaste of what was
to come. The Card pups drew first
blood on Jack Bleecker's early goal,
but the visitors quickly took charge
to lead 4-2 at half time.
Stanford drew up to within one
goal of Cal late in the game on tal
lies by Johnny Hauerwass and,
when a Cub defense man was ousted
for intentional climbing-on, had a
good chance to knot the count. But
sloppy passing on the part, of the
Papooses enabled Cal to score
while short-handed to salt away the
game..
