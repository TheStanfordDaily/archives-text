# All North Beach Sees 'Joe' Marry

### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 19 (UP), i'
—Joe DiMaggio and Dorothy Ar- !
nold were married today in St. J
Peter and Paul Cathedral, and San ,
Francisco's North Beach Italian ■
population turned out for the show '
in a carnival spirit that jammed 1
streets and broke police lines.
The wedding of the star New York i
Yankee outfielder and the Holly
wood starlet brought thousands of
gay, laughing Italians to the cathe- \
dial. They jammed the church, j
standing room was at a premium, ;
and the crowd overflowed into j
Washington Square outside. j
Even the wedding party had to j
battle the crowd for 15 minutes to ;
get inside the church. One woman
fainted in the crush at the doorway.
Although the wedding was called
for 2 p.m. the bridesmaids could not
get in until 2:14 and Miss Arnold
and her father were even later.
