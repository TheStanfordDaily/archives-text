# Scant 7000 See Cougars Defeat Indian Gridders
## Standlee Gains More Than W.S.C. Team as Three Scoring Drives Fail

Perhaps the Stanford football team has a phobia: Saturday's empty
Stadium may have shown that thoy .have that phobia which is a fear
of not having enough people around. Let's pin it on something, and on
something which the football team can be (vaguely) responsible for.
You see, all year anyone at all here on the campus who has been ac-

cused of not "living right" has been
i blamed for Stanford's defeats —and
! those guys arc getting tired of tak
ing the blame.
So let's blame it on the slim at
-1 tendance, on the mere 7000 persons

j who saw the game. Or rather, on t
their friends who stayed home.
Coach Orin E. "Babe" Holling- |
i bery's Washington Staters, who 1
! aren't used to more than that num
ber on their home lot, were in fine j
' trim and proceeded to lick the In- '
| dians, 7-0, in the first five minutes, j
i Graffled that the locals got scared i
| because no one was watching them
from the 30-yard line down, it seems
' almost certain that against Cal this
; Saturday they'll be rarin' and, tear
| in' up the field, stopping at no 20-
; or 30-yard line because of the lack
; of fan-atics. Instead of 7000 there'll
be 70,000 or up.
jSTANDLEE FORGOTTEN
The three times that Stanford was
i stalemated down in scoring terri
' tory, Norm Standlee, who gained his
j usual tremendous yardage, was for
; gotten. At the start, after Kmetovic
| and The Chief had rolled up 35
1 yards and two first downs, the In
dians called Standlee's number but
•
j once.
i When they got down there again,
Standlee tried once again. Then
I they thought he was done for, and
attempted 3 passes which dropped
incomplete. Standlee wasn't in
. j there another time and when they
did call his number, it was Thor
i Peterson at full and he lacked the
punch of The Chief.
Standlee was in rare form against
; the Cougars. He rolled up an even
• 98 yards from scrimmage but lost

six. The invaders gained but 96
yards on the ground and in the air.
The fullback ripped off 20 and 10-
yard gains, an eight, a seven, four
sixes, about three fives, and a
couple of fours during the course
of 23 tries. His average was four
yards a buck.

Standlee was in rare form against
; the Cougars. He rolled up an even
• 98 yards from scrimmage but lost

six. The invaders gained but 96
yards on the ground and in the air.
The fullback ripped off 20 and 10-
yard gains, an eight, a seven, four
sixes, about three fives, and a
couple of fours during the course
of 23 tries. His average was four
yards a buck.

Perhaps the Stanford football team has a phobia: Saturday's empty
Stadium may have shown that thoy .have that phobia which is a fear
of not having enough people around. Let's pin it on something, and on
something which the football team can be (vaguely) responsible for.
You see, all year anyone at all here on the campus who has been ac-

cused of not "living right" has been
i blamed for Stanford's defeats —and
! those guys arc getting tired of tak
ing the blame.
So let's blame it on the slim at
-1 tendance, on the mere 7000 persons

j who saw the game. Or rather, on t
their friends who stayed home.
Coach Orin E. "Babe" Holling- |
i bery's Washington Staters, who 1
! aren't used to more than that num
ber on their home lot, were in fine j
' trim and proceeded to lick the In- '
| dians, 7-0, in the first five minutes, j
i Graffled that the locals got scared i
| because no one was watching them
from the 30-yard line down, it seems
' almost certain that against Cal this
; Saturday they'll be rarin' and, tear
| in' up the field, stopping at no 20-
; or 30-yard line because of the lack
; of fan-atics. Instead of 7000 there'll
be 70,000 or up.
jSTANDLEE FORGOTTEN
The three times that Stanford was
i stalemated down in scoring terri
' tory, Norm Standlee, who gained his
j usual tremendous yardage, was for
; gotten. At the start, after Kmetovic
| and The Chief had rolled up 35
1 yards and two first downs, the In
dians called Standlee's number but
•
j once.
i When they got down there again,
Standlee tried once again. Then
I they thought he was done for, and
attempted 3 passes which dropped
incomplete. Standlee wasn't in
. j there another time and when they
did call his number, it was Thor
i Peterson at full and he lacked the
punch of The Chief.
