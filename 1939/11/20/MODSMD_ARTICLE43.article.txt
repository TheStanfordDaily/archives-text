# Cal Downs Frosh In Soccer Tilt
## 
### 
Stanford's victory-starved fresh
man soccer team went down to de
feat again Saturday against a supe
rior crew of Cal frosh, 5-1, in a
rough game at Berkeley.
The Cal offensive gathered steam
slowly, scoring in each of the first
two periods and then ramming
through three more goals in the
final half against the crumbling
Papoose defense. The Card year
lings' lone tally was made by Tommy
Trent in the third canto.
The tilt was marked by several
fouls and the spirited play nearly
caused altercations. The Cubs will
come to the Farm for the Papooses'
final battle Saturday morning.
