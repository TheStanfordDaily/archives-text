# Distance Runners Will Meet Bears
## 
### 
In what figures to be the closest |
cross-country meet in recent years j
between Stanford and California, the,
Indians and Bears will match spikes i
tomorrow afternoon over an approxi- !
mate four-mile course laid out on
the Stanford golf course.
Cal is the perennial favorite of
this annual event, but the Cards are
expected to put up a great fight this
year with either Marston Girard or
Jack Moore of the local contingent
given a good chance of winning the
race.
