# Seven to Nothing

THERE is no story about the Washington State
game on the front page today. Stanford lost
it, 7-0.
There was a story about the U.S.C. game there
a week ago, a story in big type. And Stanford
lost it, 33-0.
But in Los Angeles the boys in red faced one
of the greatest teams in the country and went
down fighting. Last Saturday they met an in
ferior aggregation and were defeated by their
own lack of spirit.
Not only did Stanford outgain the Cougars,
but one man alone, Norm Standlee, made more
yards from scrimmage than the entire Wash
ington State team. And yet the varsity did not
have the punch it takes to score.
The Stanford rooters knew this, and they were
ashamed of it —as ashamed as they had been
proud the week before when they saw the team
tear into the invulnerable Trojans. They real
ized Saturday that the players were not sip
porting their coach and their captain.
They still are carrying that thought in their
minds.
And next Saturday is the Big Game.
Always slow starters, in past years the Cards
have reached the heights of their potentialities
only when they took the field against California.
Sports writers said that it was the psychological
effect of the ancient rivalry.
But the team that went through the motions
agains Washington State looked like it was
past the point where psychology could have
any effect. It looked gutless.
This week the student body is going to enjoy
the Big Game tradition to the fullest extent.
From now until the final gun on Saturday the
"Beat Cal" spirit will boil and seethe.
But what about the team?
All the parades and rallies and bonfires and
rooting sections in the world will do no good
if the boys have lost the will to win.
A victory in the Big Game will mean a great
many things, the end of a three-year famine, a
conference record not entirely on the red side
of the ledger, the return of the Axe.
But, most important of all, it will mean the
restoration of self-respect.
Let us hope that next Saturday, win or lose,
we will see a team that looks like a Stanford
team.

THERE is no story about the Washington State
game on the front page today. Stanford lost
it, 7-0.
There was a story about the U.S.C. game there
a week ago, a story in big type. And Stanford
lost it, 33-0.
But in Los Angeles the boys in red faced one
of the greatest teams in the country and went
down fighting. Last Saturday they met an in
ferior aggregation and were defeated by their
own lack of spirit.
Not only did Stanford outgain the Cougars,
but one man alone, Norm Standlee, made more
yards from scrimmage than the entire Wash
ington State team. And yet the varsity did not
have the punch it takes to score.
The Stanford rooters knew this, and they were
ashamed of it —as ashamed as they had been
proud the week before when they saw the team
tear into the invulnerable Trojans. They real
ized Saturday that the players were not sip
porting their coach and their captain.
They still are carrying that thought in their
minds.
And next Saturday is the Big Game.
Always slow starters, in past years the Cards
have reached the heights of their potentialities
only when they took the field against California.
Sports writers said that it was the psychological
effect of the ancient rivalry.
But the team that went through the motions
agains Washington State looked like it was
past the point where psychology could have
any effect. It looked gutless.
This week the student body is going to enjoy
the Big Game tradition to the fullest extent.
From now until the final gun on Saturday the
"Beat Cal" spirit will boil and seethe.
But what about the team?
All the parades and rallies and bonfires and
rooting sections in the world will do no good
if the boys have lost the will to win.
A victory in the Big Game will mean a great
many things, the end of a three-year famine, a
conference record not entirely on the red side
of the ledger, the return of the Axe.
But, most important of all, it will mean the
restoration of self-respect.
Let us hope that next Saturday, win or lose,
we will see a team that looks like a Stanford
team.
