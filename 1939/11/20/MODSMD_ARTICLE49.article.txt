# Best of the Best

THE middle-aged man in the blue serge suit
watched the pajama-clad freshmen parade
over to Roble. Some of them came in the band,
some ran as if there was a chance Roble
wouldn't be there if they didn't get over in a
hurry, and some of them came in cars—eight
inside the car, and more than that hanging on
the outside.
The man watched them rush over to Roble,
shouting and jumping around as they ran, ex
cited by the band music, and then stop in front
of Roble and give a yell.
"Those kids don't know it," he said, "but they
are having the best time of their lives right
now." He watched them give their yells, and
then break into a disorganized roar of indis
criminate enthusiasm, and then pile helter
skelter on the cars and race for Palo Alto.
"Yep. The best time of their lives."
That is the way it will be all over the campus
this week from Wednesday on, with definite
overtones coming before. Stanford this week
will not be a university, a place of intellectual
learning. It will, instead, approximate the idea
the movies have in mind when they make all
those football pictures. It won't be like the pic
ture, mind you, but it will be like the idea they
have in mind.
No matter what the frosh bible says, this week
the freshmen—and the seniors—will not be
Stanford men and women. They will be a bunch
of kids having a good time.
Stanford simply postpones the life academic
for a few days, and its students all together pre
pare for something called the Big Game.
But it is a good week. The frosh, working
together Wednesday building the bonfire, work
ing together as a class doing something physical
that they can see, will be building, aside from
the bonfire, a memory which will last longer
lhan most they will get at Stanford.
And the emotion of Thursday night, the rally
in the Pavilion and the bonfire and the music,
building up a feeling which hits its peak as the
"pyre is set off, and mellows as the fire dies out.
Falsely emotional, perhaps, but not without a
certain strength. It is a rare night.
And then the Gaieties Friday afternoon and
night, with the proof that they are entertaining
year after year being the fact that the cast al
ways plays to a full house.
Bu above all, don't forget Saturday. Saturday,
the day 90,000 people will sit in the Stadium

and watch the pageant of the Big Game. No,
the Big Game can never miss. No matter
whether the teams are playing lor the Rose Bowl
bid or the cellar title, it can't miss. How could
it possibly be a Hop if 4,000 students plus 12,000
students have spent one week preparing for it,
and after 90,000 people have come to see it
played?—D. J.
