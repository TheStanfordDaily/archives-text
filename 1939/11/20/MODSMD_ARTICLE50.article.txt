# BULL SESSION
## ATOMS OF DUST 
### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
[VINE worlds of thought and feeling were lined up
against a wall in Prague,, blindfolded, and shot.
In each bullet-ended brain there were more neural
pathways than there are molecules in the universe. In
each mold-inherited head those myriad neurons had
made feelings and sensations and ambitions much like
those of a million other men, much like our own. Our
own and millions of other worlds of feeling go on
much the same. Nine worlds are nothing. That's all.
In the newspapers we read that the Storm Troopers
had executed nine men, and we read their deaths
not in terms of those nine men, but in terms of great
historical trends. Some of us thought of thousands of
other men who were executed by the world's tyran
nies from the time of the Egyptian Pharaohs and Aso
urbanipal of Assyria, under Alexander of Macedon
and Julius Caesar, under Napoleon, and under the
Czars of Russia. And we remembered that every tyr
anny has been crushed or decayed by the masses it
oppressed.
We wondered if the executions indicated that the
inevitable seeds of rebellion were beginning to sprout.
That is what Edouard Benes, a living patriot of de
ceased Czechoslovakia, thinks. And many students
and scholars agree with him. They are viewing the
executions with perspective. They are not thinking of
an incident involving nine lives. They are thinking of
great political pressures and economic trends, in terms
of millions of men and long periods of time.
ii< * * *
OUT* meanwhile the Allies are thinking about the
pressing events of today—about battleships and
submarines and advance defenses on the Western
Front. And the Nazi high command, grimly steeling
its empire's nerves, is thinking about the immediate
struggled of Deutchland — about the Siegfried Line
and the British blockade and martial law in the cities
where there are signs of rebellion.
And so the protagonists in long, slow struggles, feel
ing the dangers of the present, fight each battle sepa
rately. They are forced by current perils to put all
long-range ideas in the background. And so the pro
tagonists blunder. They make a treaty of Versailles,
under the pressure of immediacy, and do not think
about the long struggle's fruition. They play at power
politics and economic piracy, without remembering
the ultimate terror that power motives reap. They
butcher obedient soldiers with thoughts only of vic
tory—blind to the causes and blind to lasting peace.
And the Nazi dictatorship thinks only of executing
nine or fifty or a thousand men—not heeding the weak
ening foundations of their tyranny.
But meanwhile we live and are killed, small and
helpless as individuals. Meanwhile the nine worlds
in Prague are turning to mould.

an incident involving nine lives. They are thinking of
great political pressures and economic trends, in terms
of millions of men and long periods of time.

OUT* meanwhile the Allies are thinking about the
pressing events of today—about battleships and
submarines and advance defenses on the Western
Front. And the Nazi high command, grimly steeling
its empire's nerves, is thinking about the immediate
struggled of Deutchland — about the Siegfried Line
and the British blockade and martial law in the cities
where there are signs of rebellion.
And so the protagonists in long, slow struggles, feel
ing the dangers of the present, fight each battle sepa
rately. They are forced by current perils to put all
long-range ideas in the background. And so the pro
tagonists blunder. They make a treaty of Versailles,
under the pressure of immediacy, and do not think
about the long struggle's fruition. They play at power
politics and economic piracy, without remembering
the ultimate terror that power motives reap. They
butcher obedient soldiers with thoughts only of vic
tory—blind to the causes and blind to lasting peace.
And the Nazi dictatorship thinks only of executing
nine or fifty or a thousand men—not heeding the weak
ening foundations of their tyranny.
But meanwhile we live and are killed, small and
helpless as individuals. Meanwhile the nine worlds
in Prague are turning to mould.
[VINE worlds of thought and feeling were lined up
against a wall in Prague,, blindfolded, and shot.
In each bullet-ended brain there were more neural
pathways than there are molecules in the universe. In
each mold-inherited head those myriad neurons had
made feelings and sensations and ambitions much like
those of a million other men, much like our own. Our
own and millions of other worlds of feeling go on
much the same. Nine worlds are nothing. That's all.
In the newspapers we read that the Storm Troopers
had executed nine men, and we read their deaths
not in terms of those nine men, but in terms of great
historical trends. Some of us thought of thousands of
other men who were executed by the world's tyran
nies from the time of the Egyptian Pharaohs and Aso
urbanipal of Assyria, under Alexander of Macedon
and Julius Caesar, under Napoleon, and under the
Czars of Russia. And we remembered that every tyr
anny has been crushed or decayed by the masses it
oppressed.
We wondered if the executions indicated that the
inevitable seeds of rebellion were beginning to sprout.
That is what Edouard Benes, a living patriot of de
ceased Czechoslovakia, thinks. And many students
and scholars agree with him. They are viewing the
executions with perspective. They are not thinking of
an incident involving nine lives. They are thinking of
great political pressures and economic trends, in terms
of millions of men and long periods of time.
