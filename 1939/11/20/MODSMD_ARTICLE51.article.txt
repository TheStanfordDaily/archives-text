## HORTENSE AND HELL WEEK 
### 
r rHE EDITOR. SIR:
I do hope that you are not getting too tired of
my writing to you so very often, but I do feel that
you are one of the more understanding people that I
have had the pleasure of meeting in correspondence.
1 have exchanged letters with some charming indivi
duals through letter-writing clubs, but on eventually
meeting them our friendship always seemed to
dwindle. . . .
What really prompted me to write this letter was a
chat. I had with my boy friend the other evening. (My
boy friend calls me his Stanford stale-mate; don't
you think that is rather cute? I think what he means
is that I have him buffaloed). Anyway, as he called
on me early, and we soon got tired of playing double
solitaire, we got to just talking. He is a Row man,
you know, and sometimes gets quite excited over their
problems.
Right now it. seems as though everyone along there
is wondering what will become of "Hell Week." There
seems to be quite a movement under way, by certain
parties, to dispense with this period of initiation and
its "Hell." We agreed that they may have certain justi
fications to back up their contentions, but they do
seem shallow. . . .
r r , o US it really appears stupid to try and dispel
with a wave of the hand all that has come to us
as traditional. Our educational system may not be
as old as some, but at least we have the movies to
teach us what to expect of colleges. When the fresh
man arrives here it docs indeed seem that he has
certain ideas in the back of his mind as to what col
lege and its traditions should be; ideas planted there
by the cinema, and nurtured all through high school.
It is really fortunate that there is no break from
this wholesome and healthy attitude during his Encina
days, which must be just too, too wonderful. I really
think that everyone will agree that his freshman
months are happy and carefree, sprinkled with a de
lightful seasoning of horseplay, so essential to devel
oping the broad college man.
Are they going to cast him from this enlightened
paradise into an altitude of stuffy intellectual con
servatism? There is a place for the staid academic out
look, based on a feeling of scholarly understanding,
but certainly not on our Farm.

I AM firmly convinced that you will find the girls
strongly backing the boys in their contention "Hell
Week" is a tradition, and one going back through the
college hey-days of the late 1920'5, back through the
pre-war man's man period, even back far before the
turn of the century, when college had all those glorious
attributes that are all the whole being slulTed off by
well-meaning reformers. Really boys, it is your duty
1o try and again capture that golden age of the Ameri
can College, the period about 1928-29, which we see
portrayed so rarely, except for the movies and occa
sionally in Encina.
Perhaps you feel that this transition that is being
thrust upon the men of Stanford has little concern for
the co-ed, but. it is deeper than that, many of us have
brothers ready to come to Stanford, and we certainly
don't, want them to acquire the unhealthy intellec
tual attitude so prevalent among the older eastern col
leges. We want them to be real men, college men, in
every sense of the word. By gradually stripping from
us our traditions it will become increasingly difficult
for the younger fellows coming up to maintain this
attitude and feeling. I want my little brother, Ru
dolphe, to bo just like Joe Coberly, who occasionally
takes out a girl that rooms near me. Gee, I think he is
just grand.
I could close in no better way than declaring that
Stanford's My Standard,
