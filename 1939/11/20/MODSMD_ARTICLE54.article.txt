"THE ROAIUNG TWENTIES," nou
playing at the Fox Stanford.
Well, geez, I durmo what to tell
ya ta do about dis flicker, an' no
foolin'! If dey'd a spent less den I
twenty grand on it, ya coulda called
it a B pitcher, cuz hully chee, it sure
wuz. And foider dan dat, Chimmy
Cagney and Humphrey Bogart go
aroun' talkin' like dis, until you
could bile cher nails.
And if you can knife your way
through dialogue like that, you'll i
see what the rise and fall of a rack
eteer looks like according to Broth
ers Warner. The story opens with
three buddies in a shell hole,
toward the end of the 1914-18 Un
pleasantness in Europe. Returning
to the United States, the three go
their separate ways—Cagney back to
his former trade of mechanic, Bo
gart back to the underworld, and
Jeffrey Lynn into a law office.
Cagney, forced by the post-war
depression into small time boot
legging, is as brash as usual, goes
around clipping people on the jaw,
and loses the girl (Priscilla Lane) in
the end. His rise to the depths of
the bootleggers is deftly aided by
Lynn as his lawyer. He meets Bo
gart, finds in him a conspirator after
his own heart, and embarks upon a
career of mutual distrust until the
usual guns blaze after the usual
double cross, and Cagney dies melo
dramatically upon the steps of a
church.
The connection between this and
the decade of the twenties is dragged
in by means of a vinegar-voiced
commentator and some old news
reel clips they had around.
The "D" picture is called "No
Place to Go," and is the one about
the father who comes to live with
his son and daughter-in-law. There

are some swell football games in
the newsreel, however. —Littleboy
