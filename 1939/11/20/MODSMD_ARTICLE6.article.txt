# Gaieties to Headline Conga Written by Arias, Henshaw

### MARY ETTA FARRELL 
"And take Arias," said Charlie Bulotti, discussing the talent in the Big
Game (iaieties. "At 2 o'clock one afternoon, I told him to get Bucky Hen
shaw and go out and write a conga. At 1 o'clock they came hack with it
all written, words and music!"
The conga that Adolfo Arias and Bucky Henshaw whipped up in two

hours is going to be the big dance,
number of this year's Gaieties.
Why? Arias comes from Panama,
the land of the conga. So the conga
they wrote, which is entitled sim
ply, "Purum-ban-bon," is plenty
authentic.
Adolfo, a slight., vital, dark fel
low has become known as the Pana
manian jitterbug around the cam
pus; the result of last year's Spring
Show when he partnered Shirley
Jones in the big jitterbug number.
NO SWING IN PANAMA
I don't know why, though," says
Arias, "I never did any jitter-bug
ging until last year. In Panama we
don't have much swing."
The conga, according to Arias, can
only be compared to the bolero, al
though it has a certain similarity to
| a rhumba or tango in that the music
, has a very marked rhythm. It is
African in origin but the American
| version is the one that is done in
' Cuba. It has become very fashion
j able in the night spots of New York
i and Los Angeles during the past
year.
AKIAS PLAYS 14 ROLES
Arias is a sophomore at Stanford,
j and last year appeared in 14 pro
| ductions in the Memorial Theater,
I turning in performances in "The
' Lower Depths" and "No More
! Peace."
His early interest in the theater is
| evidenced by a play he wrote while
attending Georgetown Prep, near
Washington, D.C. "It was called
They Didn't Take It with Them,"
I he confesses. It was a light comedy
â€¢ of Central America.
Arias composed the jitterbug
| number in the Gaieties also, getting
I his ideas from innumerable movies
j But ihe conga, ho asserts, is the one
| big number.
