SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 19 (UP).
—Attempts to settle San Francisco's
waterfront tieup were inactive today
as striking C.1.0. ship clerks and
warehousemen and their employers
made no move to reach an agree
ment.
Old battle lines that have seen
service since the big strike of 1934
were forming steadily on either side
and it was feared Ihe tightening
deadlock might upset negotiations
now under way between other wa
terfront unions and their employers
for contracts.
