### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
WHENEVER Cordell Hull wants
** to take a slap at a foreign
power, he calls in his ace trouble
shooter, Sumner Welles.
Yesterday Welles "had a busy day.
Tired of interference with American
nationals and U. S. trade by Japa
nese military authorities at Tient
sin, Welles warned Tokyo that the
American government "takes a se
rious view" of continued trouble
from the Orient.
Mr. Welles said that his official re
ports showed interference is in
creasing despite the fact that our
government had informed the Japa
nese government that the United
States considers its citizens have
every right to carry on their trade
in China without interference.
* * *
This view, Mr. Welles said, has
been made clear repeatedly to the
Japanese authorities by American
consular and diplomatic chief
tains in both Japan and China.
Welles intimated that he was get
ting pretty tired of having Ameri
can rights invaded and American
citizens roughed lip by Japanese
military-men.
Mr. Welles told newsmen that the
American consul general at Tient
sin, John Caldwell, had telegraphed
the State Department a week ago
that difficulties of transit at the
military barriers were increasing.
This was a strange development,
because the insults to Americans
had been decreasing until recent
months. Mr. Caldwell said that al
though only a few cases of delay to
American citizens had been reported,
he was receiving many complaints
of delay, ranging from a few hours
to more than a day, to American
goods.
example, he said that Japa
nese military authorities have
required that loads of coal and
peanuts be dumped upon the
street for inspection.
The difficulty in the whole situa
tion is the delay to essential goods
that are bound for the American
concession. The lack of certain food
supplies—and, of course, coal—may
involve privation and distress for
American nationals. Of course, the
trouble is not sufficiently acute yet
to warrant any strong measures, but
Welles' pointed protest indicates
that the United States is displeased
at Jfjpahese moves to halt the ready
flow of necessities to our citizens in
the foreign concession zone.
* * *
AT THE crux of the whole mat
ter lies the position of Ameri
cans in the Orient. To the Japa
nese, China is their own province.
As long as three years ago they
said, "Dibs on China." And the
United States, if it wishes to trade
in China and deal with the Chi
nese, must realize that its trading
and dealing should conform to the
established procedure of the gov
ernment that rules that country.
* * #
Our interests in China are con
fined to a very few large investors.
Beyond that, we have small actual
interest there. If American nation
als arc willing to lake the risk of
living in areas that are governed by
military rule, they should abide by
the regulations that are established.
There is no reason why people who
have been warned repeatedly to va
cate dangerous areas should remain
under the protection of a benevo
lent, though distant, country that is
apparently willing to go to bat for
them whenever their rugs are spread
on the street for inspection or when
ever their coal is dumped ignomin
iously in the gutter to sec if it har
bors "a spy."
Of course, intelligent people
cannot condone a militaristic atti
tude that inflicts hardships on
neutrals in a foreign land—espe
cially when those neutrals have
every right to he there.
But, from a practical point of
view, United States investments do
not warrant the risk of involving a
nation of 130,000,000 people in argu
ments that can only lead to interna
tional ill-will and possible strife.
