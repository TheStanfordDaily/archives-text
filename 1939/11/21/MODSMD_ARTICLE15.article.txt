# Scoreboard Worker Claims 'Best Seat in Farm Stadium'
## 
### BUD AMES 
"Stanford's hall. First down, 10 yard to go. Second down, 13 yards
to go."
And behind all this Saturday-afternoon-tragedy stands Bob Wil
liams, the lanky good looking lad who chalks up Stanford's goose-eggs
inside the stadium's South scoreboard.

Bob—he's a freshman from up
Sausalito way—is one of the four
lads who tend the Farm's two score
boards. On game day, he reports to
the booth about 1:30 o'clock in or
der to arrange the numbers and
"unblank" the board. Ten minutes
after the final gun, he has taken
down the opposition's score, stored
away Stanford's, and is on his way
back to Encina.
DIVIDED INTO FLOORS
Technically speaking, the board is
about 18 feet tall, six feet deep, and
about 30 or 40 feet long. It's di
vided into two floors by a tier, with
Bob running the bottom half; that
is, the quarter and the yards to go
to a first down.
Up above, Bob's partner takes
care of the holes designating downs,
team with ball, and the score. To
taled, that makes about a "baker's
dozen" number of holes which the
pair must keep constantly filled
with figures.
NUMERALS BACK HOLES
As Bob explains it, each hole is
backed with a complete set of nu
merals—o to o—each printed on an
individual thin sheet-metal strip
measuring about 2'-j by 2 Vi* feet.
It's Bob's task to slide the proper
sheet into position as the occasion
demands.
Correct facts and figures are wired
to the scoreboard booth and Bob's
set. of ear phones by one "Baldy"
Wilson, that man you have seen
down on the field with the little
phone, and the miles of electrical
cord.
"You have to keep on your toes,
but the work comes in spurts," Bob
explained. "We watch all the game
through little slots in the board. It's
the Ix'st seat in the stadium."
