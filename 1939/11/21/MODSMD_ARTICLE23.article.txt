should be displayed on the float;
floats must be in line at the Fiji
house promptly at 5 o'clock Thurs

JUDGING STANDARDS
Judging will be done on the Post
Office steps on the basis of original
ity, simplicity, and novelty of idea.
Prizes to be awarded in the dif
ferent divisions of the float contest,
as listed by Lariy Freer and Pat
Smith, include five loving cups,
candy, a football, phonograph rec
ords, playing cards, book-ends,

The traditional finale of the an
nual pre-Big Game Thursday' activ
ity will be the Bonfire, planned by
Cardinals and to be built by!mem
bers of the Class of '43.
GOOD BONFIRE PLANNED
The Bonfire, according to all
available information, will lose none
of its former lake-bed glory'by its
transference to the field behind
Branner Hall. Telephone ' poles
forming the framework for the tow
ering pyre will be erected by Wed
nesday night, stated Jack Alltucker,
chairman of construction.
Poles will probably be the usual
height of 60 feet, mounted in two
equilateral triangles. If more wood
than can be accommodated by poles
of this height is secured by the
frosh, extensions can be erected atop
the poles, increasing the height to
approximately 75 feet.
To prevent repetition of the pub
lic objection encountered in former
years from the over-anxious and
enterprising freshmen violating pri
vate property rights in their search
for combustible material, a system
of checking has been instituted.
WOOD TO BE CHECKED
Sophomore and junior men will
ride the trucks with the freshmen,
starting at 6 o'clock Thursday morn
ing, to prevent the removal of any
tabooed material. Double-checking
will be handled at the site of the fire
where Head Encina Sponsor Joe
Weiner and A.S.S.U. President Ken
Cuthbertson will further approve
all wood brought in.
As a convenience to frosh work
ing on the fire, lunches will be
served by Betty Moses and her
committee of 40 women.
Another affair filling the pro
game period include the Big Game
jolly-up from 4 to 6 o'clock in the
Pavilion iollowing the matinee per
formance of the Big Game Gaieties.
Ernie Hecksher will provide the
music.
