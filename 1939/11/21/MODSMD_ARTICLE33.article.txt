# Youth of Europe Views War With Little Hope for Future
## 
### WALT STOESSEL 
(This is (lit' third and final article in a series on the European scene
by a prominent Stanford undergraduate wlio writes from Lausanne,
Switzerland.)

One of the most depressing results of the war so far, I believe, is the
reaction it has caused among the youth of Europe. For them, the future
is a dark one indeed. Their plans and ambitions have been smashed—and
there has come into being a certain hopelessness concerning their own
lives that is far from pleasant to come into contact with.

Several English friends of
conscripted about a month ago, have t
written me from posts in the interior |
of France, and, in reading their let- |
ters—heavily censored as they were
• —I had the queer feeling that I was
reading the words of men already
dead.
In a way those letters were in
spiring. They realize that the
chances are very good that they will '
die under fire, but nevertheless, j
they all said, with a curious unan- I
imity of feeling that, if they must ;
die, they would be glad to give their
lives for a worth while cause —that
of freedom. They have little hope
for themselves—but they seem to
feel that perhaps, by giving their
lives, the world of tomorrow will be j
a better one.
CO-OPERATION HOPELESS
Talk of international co-operation
and of tolerance seems out of char
acter in the present situation. All
the peoples of Europe appear so in
fused with theories of race suprem- J
acy, nationalism, fear of each other,
selfishness and hatred that co-opera
tion between them seems a hopeless
dream.
It is hard to be constructive when
one talks of the European situation.
I can see no solution for the prob
lems of Europe, and yet I realize,
as do even the men who are fight
ing at the front, that war is not the
"way out."
I have heard a great many people j
say quite confidently and callously I
that this war will mean a return to
the "Dark Ages" and the destruc
tion of our civilization. Such a dire
eventuality is certainly possible —
but I refuse to Ix'lieve in it.
SOLUTION IMPOSSIBLE
Because a solution appears almost
impossible is no reason why we;
should, out of sheer despair, join
the rapidly increasing ranks of the ;
spiritual defeatists, acknowledge;
mankind beaten and give up the!
battle completely.

Here in Europe the future is black
and depressing, but there are people
in the thick of the melee who, con
vinced that this does not mean the
end of civilization in Europe, refuse
to be traitors to the future of the
human race.
—And that is the one encouraging
observation I can find to make on
what is, in toto, a very discouraging
situation.

as do even the men who are fight
ing at the front, that war is not the

I have heard a great many people j
say quite confidently and callously I
that this war will mean a return to

SOLUTION IMPOSSIBLE
Because a solution appears almost
impossible is no reason why we;
should, out of sheer despair, join
the rapidly increasing ranks of the ;
spiritual defeatists, acknowledge;
mankind beaten and give up the!
battle completely.

Here in Europe the future is black
and depressing, but there are people
in the thick of the melee who, con
vinced that this does not mean the
end of civilization in Europe, refuse
to be traitors to the future of the
human race.

observation I can find to make on

One of the most depressing results of the war so far, I believe, is the
reaction it has caused among the youth of Europe. For them, the future
is a dark one indeed. Their plans and ambitions have been smashed—and
there has come into being a certain hopelessness concerning their own
lives that is far from pleasant to come into contact with.

Several English friends of
conscripted about a month ago, have t
written me from posts in the interior |
of France, and, in reading their let- |
ters—heavily censored as they were
• —I had the queer feeling that I was
reading the words of men already
dead.
In a way those letters were in
spiring. They realize that the
chances are very good that they will '
die under fire, but nevertheless, j
they all said, with a curious unan- I
imity of feeling that, if they must ;
die, they would be glad to give their
lives for a worth while cause —that
of freedom. They have little hope
for themselves—but they seem to
feel that perhaps, by giving their
lives, the world of tomorrow will be j
a better one.
CO-OPERATION HOPELESS
Talk of international co-operation
and of tolerance seems out of char
acter in the present situation. All
the peoples of Europe appear so in
fused with theories of race suprem- J
acy, nationalism, fear of each other,
selfishness and hatred that co-opera
tion between them seems a hopeless
dream.
It is hard to be constructive when
one talks of the European situation.
