Biggest thing in the Big Game 1
Gaieties, literally, will be u tre
mendous revolving stage, according j
to Chet Johnson, technical director.
The revolving stage will turn in full
view of the audience several times
and will furnish the basic unit for ;
the majority of the other sets.
"The revolving stage is included i
in our program to eliminate the un- i
fortunate pauses due to scene shifts,
which have caused complaints in;
other Gaieties. We are striving to i
make the sets simple yet effective ;
and, most of all, easy to change. It !
is going to be a really 'streamlined'
show," Johnson said.
40 PEOPLE WORKING
About 40 people are working day j
in and night out getting the sets
and technical-end ready to roll
when the curtain goes up on tho Big
Game Gaieties of 1939 at the matinee

"The revolving stage is included i
in our program to eliminate the un- i
fortunate pauses due to scene shifts,
which have caused complaints in;
other Gaieties. We are striving to i
make the sets simple yet effective ;
and, most of all, easy to change. It !
is going to be a really 'streamlined'
show," Johnson said.
40 PEOPLE WORKING
About 40 people are working day j
in and night out getting the sets
and technical-end ready to roll
when the curtain goes up on tho Big
Game Gaieties of 1939 at the matinee
at 2:15 o'clock Friday afternoon. In
varying stages of completion in the !
back shop, are the promenade deck ;
of an ocean liner, the dock along j
side, and a facsimile of Roble's i
lobby—switchboard, fireplace, "love '
seats," and all.
The technical crew is also work- |
ing behind closed doors on the big |
mystery number of the show, a |
number which will not be revealed
to the campus until performance 1
time.
CAST DINES TOGETHER
In order to keep the technical !
work and rehearsals going at full
speed, the cast and technical crew
observed an old Gaieties tradition I
last night by dining buffet style in 1
the Ram's Head room. Charlie Bu- j
lotti, director, and Johnson, tech- |
nical director, hosted the affair, also (
according to long-standing custom.
Assisting Johnson as technical di
rector will be Asher Wilson, stage
manager. Peter Wagenheim will be
crew manager; Lois Feldheym will
handle the lighting; A1 Agnew,
make-up; Florence Hinds, cos
tumes; and Betty Anne Wagner will
be in charge of properties.
This Gaieties will be Johnson's
last one—for a while at least. At j
the close of fall quarter, the Gaieties |
technical director and Ruth Martin, !
on the Gaieties production staff and j
one of the featured performers, will '
be married. They have both been J
active in Farm dramatics and are'
both Ram's Head members.
Biggest thing in the Big Game 1
Gaieties, literally, will be u tre
mendous revolving stage, according j
to Chet Johnson, technical director.
The revolving stage will turn in full
view of the audience several times
and will furnish the basic unit for ;
the majority of the other sets.
