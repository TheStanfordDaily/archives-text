# Card Harriers Meet Cal Today
## 
### 
Facing a strong California cross
country team, five Indian distance
men will enter the annual long
distance grind in the underdog role
this afternoon at 3:30 o'clock over i
an approximate four-mile route at j
the Stanford golf course.
With the first ten places counting, I
and only five Stanford entries, the !
Bears are favored to run up the I
highest score; but Marston Girard i
and Jack Moore are going to make j
it plenty tough for Cal's 14-man i
tsquad which is headed by Veteran j
Stan Sadaj.
Last week Girard was timed in j
22:37 running against Moore and sev- !
eral other distance men from Stan- j
ford and San Jose State. The j
other Indian entries are Paul Moore, j
Aubrey Seed, and Burman Skrable. I
Cal's starters include Bower, Bus- i
zek, Cooper, Ferrier, Mclntyre, Mil- j
ler, Sadaj, Sugden, Summers, Van !
Court, Vollmer, Wagener, and Bad
ger.
