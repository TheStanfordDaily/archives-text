### JERRY MAYER 
TRACKMEN PICKET EACH
OTHER AS SQUAD SPLIT

A cute little pickaninny with a
j wide smile and ivory-white teeth
! paraded out onto Angell Field the
| other day bearing a sandwich sign,
j one side of which read as follows:
| "Girard is a Scab," and the other
j side reading "Down with the
i Greens."
Thus was civil war launched in
! the ranks of Stanford's track team.
All this rivalry and competition
j is in preparation for the big intra-
I squad meet coming up Dec. 6.
Coach Bill Ellington has divided
the team into two squads, dubbed
the "Greens," who are captained by
Marston Girard, and the "Reds," led
by Craig Williamson. Every day
the cindermen work out with either
little red or green ribbons pinned on
to their jerseys, and things are be
coming so hot that the men on the
rival teams are even starting to lay
bets on the outcome.
Outstanding members of Captain
Williamson's Red team are himself
in the 440, distance men Jack and
Paul Moore, hurdler Dick Simpson,
and high jumper Jim Lincoln.
Besides himself running the mile,
Fuehrer Girard has sprinter Les
Johnsen, half-miler Barney 'Fergu
son, high-jumper Russ Wulff,
broad-jumper Ray Brown, and shot
putter A1 Grey among others.
Each team has been posting signs
degrading the other and by the
time Dec. 6 rolls around Stanford's
little civil war will probably as
sume gigantic proportions.
Why, the men may even show up
with guns concealed in their jer
seys.
STANFORD CINCH TO WIN
BIG GAME FROM CAL
The old saying that "comparisons
are odious" may be true but never
theless a Stanford man has to grasp
at any pillar that shows his team
has a chance for victory Saturday in
the Big Game.
And after much research Slants
finds that according to comparisons
the Indians figure to win TWO
points even though the Bears have
won one Conference game and the
Cards none.
Look over these comparative
scores against Conference foes:
Oregon State 12, Stanford 0
Oregon State 21, California 0
Oregon 10, Stanford 0
Oregon 6, California 0
U.C.L.A. 14, Stanford 14
U.C.L.A. 20, California 7
Washington 8, Stanford 5
Washington 13, California 6
U.S.C. 33, Stanford 0
U.S.C. 26, California 0
Washington State 7, Stanford 0
Washington State 7, California 13
There it is—compare each game
and total the results and by golly
Stanford is two points superior to
the Bears.

If you want to get some real
thrills, trot out to the Intramural
Field at 4 o'clock today and watch
those Ze-tes and Firehouse play—
what is laughingly called touch
football.
The two teams battled to a 6-6
tie in yesterday's championship '
game, and instead of playing it off
in the regular fashion by allowing I
each team five scrimmage plays !
from midfield, the outfits decided to
replay the whole game today.

I squad meet coming up Dec. 6.
Coach Bill Ellington has divided
the team into two squads, dubbed
the "Greens," who are captained by
Marston Girard, and the "Reds," led
by Craig Williamson. Every day
the cindermen work out with either
little red or green ribbons pinned on
to their jerseys, and things are be
coming so hot that the men on the
rival teams are even starting to lay
bets on the outcome.
Outstanding members of Captain
Williamson's Red team are himself
in the 440, distance men Jack and
Paul Moore, hurdler Dick Simpson,
and high jumper Jim Lincoln.
Besides himself running the mile,
Fuehrer Girard has sprinter Les
Johnsen, half-miler Barney 'Fergu
son, high-jumper Russ Wulff,
broad-jumper Ray Brown, and shot
putter A1 Grey among others.
Each team has been posting signs
degrading the other and by the
time Dec. 6 rolls around Stanford's
little civil war will probably as
sume gigantic proportions.
Why, the men may even show up
with guns concealed in their jer
seys.
STANFORD CINCH TO WIN
BIG GAME FROM CAL
The old saying that "comparisons
are odious" may be true but never
theless a Stanford man has to grasp
at any pillar that shows his team
has a chance for victory Saturday in
the Big Game.
And after much research Slants
finds that according to comparisons
the Indians figure to win TWO
points even though the Bears have
won one Conference game and the
Cards none.
Look over these comparative
scores against Conference foes:
Oregon State 12, Stanford 0
Oregon State 21, California 0
Oregon 10, Stanford 0
Oregon 6, California 0
U.C.L.A. 14, Stanford 14
U.C.L.A. 20, California 7
Washington 8, Stanford 5
Washington 13, California 6
U.S.C. 33, Stanford 0
U.S.C. 26, California 0
Washington State 7, Stanford 0
Washington State 7, California 13
There it is—compare each game
and total the results and by golly
Stanford is two points superior to
the Bears.

If you want to get some real
thrills, trot out to the Intramural
Field at 4 o'clock today and watch
those Ze-tes and Firehouse play—
what is laughingly called touch
football.
The two teams battled to a 6-6
tie in yesterday's championship '
game, and instead of playing it off
in the regular fashion by allowing I
each team five scrimmage plays !
from midfield, the outfits decided to
replay the whole game today.
