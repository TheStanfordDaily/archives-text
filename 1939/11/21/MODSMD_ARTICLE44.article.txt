# Coldiron Returns to Line-up As Cards Pose for Pictures
## 
### 
The home stretch.
Indian gridders opened the last
week of practice before the Big
Game with a long offensive drill
last night. Most of the session, after
photographers had finished shooting
pictures of the squad, was devoted
to running through plays.
It's the first time in 45 years that
a Farm eleven has come up to the
Cal game without a victory under
its belt, but the gang out there last
night had all the fire and spirit of a
championship ball club.
Gene Coldiron, scrappy red
headed quarterback who missed the
Washington State game because of a
bad knee, was back at his first string
position with a specially made brace
that enabled him to run as well as
ever.
DONAHUE STILL OUT
Corky Donahue, who has been on
the shelf since the Santa Clara game,
limped out to watch practice, but
was unable to work. It's possible
that he'll see action against the Bears
if a wrecked knee straightens out,
but he won't have much time to get
back in .shape.
Fred Meyer, sophomore end who
has developed into a first class wing
man during the season, was back in
a suit and took part in the session.
Stan Graff came out of the W.S.C.
tilt with a pair of injured ankles
and took a day off, but will be ready
to take the fieid Saturday. Bill Greer
took over his left end post for the
afternoon.
I Pete Kmetovic was in the first
string backfield with Coldiron,
Standlee, and Gallarneau. Kmet
compiled an average of eight yards
per try against the Cougars, but car
ried the ball only three times.
TINY DRILLS BACKFIELD
Tiny Thornhill had a pony back
field working on the second string.
Frankie Albert and Johnny Stur
geon, 165-pounders, were at the
halfbacks. Bob Crane was at quar
ter and Thor Peterson at full. Both
Crane and Peterson weigh in the
neighborhood of 180 pounds.
Bob Templeton, another injured
Indian, is not expected to be ready
to see action against Cal.
Chick Orme was working in the
right guard spot that has been weak
ened by injuries to Johnny Kerman
and Steve Keussef. Hamp Pool was
his running mate at left guard.
Swede Johansen was running plays
from right tackle with the first
bunch. Andy Stojkovich was at his
regular right end post, Jim Verdieck

I was at center, and Captain Stan An
derson was at left tackle.
In contrast to the long list of in
! juries on the Farm squad, Stub Al
j lison announced in Berkeley that the
| Bears will be at full strength for the
j first time since the season opened.
Ted Hubert and Lopin' Louie Smith,
j Cal backfield aces who have been
| out since early fall, are slated to see
' action.

to running through plays.
It's the first time in 45 years that
a Farm eleven has come up to the
Cal game without a victory under
its belt, but the gang out there last
night had all the fire and spirit of a
championship ball club.
Gene Coldiron, scrappy red
headed quarterback who missed the
Washington State game because of a
bad knee, was back at his first string
position with a specially made brace
that enabled him to run as well as
ever.
DONAHUE STILL OUT
Corky Donahue, who has been on
the shelf since the Santa Clara game,
limped out to watch practice, but
was unable to work. It's possible
that he'll see action against the Bears
if a wrecked knee straightens out,
but he won't have much time to get
back in .shape.
Fred Meyer, sophomore end who
has developed into a first class wing
man during the season, was back in
a suit and took part in the session.
Stan Graff came out of the W.S.C.
tilt with a pair of injured ankles
and took a day off, but will be ready
to take the fieid Saturday. Bill Greer
took over his left end post for the
afternoon.
I Pete Kmetovic was in the first
string backfield with Coldiron,
Standlee, and Gallarneau. Kmet
compiled an average of eight yards
per try against the Cougars, but car
ried the ball only three times.
TINY DRILLS BACKFIELD
Tiny Thornhill had a pony back
field working on the second string.
Frankie Albert and Johnny Stur
geon, 165-pounders, were at the
halfbacks. Bob Crane was at quar
ter and Thor Peterson at full. Both
Crane and Peterson weigh in the
neighborhood of 180 pounds.
Bob Templeton, another injured
Indian, is not expected to be ready
to see action against Cal.
Chick Orme was working in the
right guard spot that has been weak
ened by injuries to Johnny Kerman
and Steve Keussef. Hamp Pool was
his running mate at left guard.
Swede Johansen was running plays
from right tackle with the first
bunch. Andy Stojkovich was at his
regular right end post, Jim Verdieck

I was at center, and Captain Stan An
derson was at left tackle.
In contrast to the long list of in
! juries on the Farm squad, Stub Al
j lison announced in Berkeley that the
| Bears will be at full strength for the
j first time since the season opened.
Ted Hubert and Lopin' Louie Smith,
j Cal backfield aces who have been
| out since early fall, are slated to see
' action.
The home stretch.
Indian gridders opened the last
week of practice before the Big
Game with a long offensive drill
last night. Most of the session, after
photographers had finished shooting
pictures of the squad, was devoted
to running through plays.
