# Card Booters Beat S.M.J.C.
## 
### 
In a dull, uninspired game, Farm
soccermen gained a 2-0 victory over
San Mateo Junior College on the
Stanford field yesterday.
George Dole and Kenny Cuthbert
son made the Card scores. Cuth
bertson, whose regular position is
right ha I (back, moved up to inside
left in the forward line for a trial,
and came through with a tally.
It was the second win of the year
for the Cards over the San Mateo
team. In a game earlier in the sea
son, the Farm hooters came through
with a 5-0 win.
The last few minutes of the game
were played in almost complete
darkness. It was the last contest for
the Indian squad before they meet
Cal Saturday morning before the
Big Game. Last week in Berkeley
Harry Maloney's team held the fa
vored Bears to a 1-1 tic.
