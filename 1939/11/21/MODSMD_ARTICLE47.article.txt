# Card Splashers To End Season With Cal Game
## Play-off for Cellar Title to Take Place In Berkeley Pools 
### 
Stanford's last chance at saving it
sell from the Pacific Coast Confer
ence's water polo caller will be ex
hibited tomorrow.
It will consist of another shot at
the University of California, the same
Golden Bear team which mercilessly
pounded out a 5 to 0 victory over
the Cards last Friday afternoon.
CARDS ARE UNDERDOGS
The game was considered a near
toss-up, with a very slight advan
tage to Stanford, but this, the;
comeback try at Berkeley, will find
the locals in a definite underdog's j
role.
Possibly that's what the Indians:
need. All season long they have
been thrown into the favorite's spot,
and the extra strain which accom
panies such a role doesn't do a team
any good, it is pointed out by fol
lowers.
DOWLING MAY START
Meanwhile, tomorrow's game may, |
or may not, see Frank Dowling back
in the Cardinal goal. The rest of the
team will be composed of Captain
Bob Plate, whose educational diffi
culties are now straightened out,
Ted Moreno, Dick Hoover, Fred
Manwaring and Bill Bleecker.
Tomorrow's bill brings to a final i
curtain, the careers of Captain j
Plate, Hoover, Dowling, Bleecker, i
Bob Allen, and Bill Bums.
