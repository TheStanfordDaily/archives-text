STAMPING feet made the floors shake, roar
ing voices made the walls rock—but the
audience had as much fun as the actors when
the Big Game Gaieties was presented in the
old Assembly Hall.
None but the senior class, when it chooses to
be sentimental, can remember how Stanford
turned from the drafty old barn to the slick
plaster walls and soft red plush of Memorial
Hall for its first smooth edition of the Gaieties.
What the show had lost in pep and informality,
it made up in speed, spectacle, and general
professional tone.
Only one thing was wrong: it could not be
heard.
The expensive new sound system which was
constructed especially for the theater went
dead, and songs and gags passed by most of
the 1700 seats unnoticed.
Last year Gaieties technicians attempted to
remedy the situation by suspending huge, bat
like speakers over the orchestra pit. Despite
the uneasy glances upward of front row specta
tors, all went well during most of the first act.
But right in the middle of a big scene the micro
phones went dead again, and the rest of the
show went on unheard.
Memorial Hall is equipped with the finest
type of sound system available. Only once has
it failed during the Tuesday Evening Lecture
Series. And there is no reason why it should
die in the face of an eager student audience at
the Gaieties.
In case an able graduate engineering student
is not handy, the price of the tickets is high
enough to allow Ram's Head to hire an electrical
technician, a sound expert, or anybody who
can guarantee that the temperamental machine
will not go dead.
Previews and publicity blurbs indicate that
the 1939 Big Game Gaieties will be one of the
best shows in Stanford history—if it can be
heard.
