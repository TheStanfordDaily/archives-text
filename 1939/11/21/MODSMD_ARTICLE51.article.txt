# The 						Battle of the Sexes

### 
STANFORD'S women think the men slow; the
men are certain that the women have too
much conscious dignity to be fun on a date.
We have in this situation the makings of a
first-class civil war. We hate to suggest it, but
here is such material as revolutionists dream
of. Anything can happen. A glimpse into the
future reveals frightening possibilities.
What if the men boycott the women, refuse
to date them? Roble's doors will close every
night at dinner time, there will be no coke dates
leaving Lagunita, or any dates at all for that
matter. The men will hie their injured mascu
linity down the highway and take lonesome
solace in beer, or something worse.
Or perhaps the women will institute the boy
cott. "Sorry, she's not in," will be the only an
swer to a male voice on the telephone. Hefty
feminine guards will police Lagunita's doors and
shoo hopeful men away. The girls will stay
home and study, or whatever they do when
they're not out.
The whole situation is a little ridiculous, but
it has also an element of truth that makes it
worth considering. This world is reputed to be
a co-educational place, and it would seem wise
for Stanford's embittered sexes to get together
once in a while and forget their mad.
It is faintly reminiscent of the time when we
all said, "You can't play in my sand pile."
But in spite of Stanford's date phobia, tickets
for the Big Game Dance seem to be selling.
With four days yet to go, sale of the bids is

satisfactory, report the chairmen. The affair is a
natural for the night of the California-Stanford
epic, and will be well attended. The self-con
sciousness of Stanford daters won't jeopardize
it,
A large number of Stanford's so-far undated
1750 males will call a large number of Stan
ford's 700 undated women, sign them up for
Big Game night, and a menacing situation will
be averted.
That is, unless the men really are slow, and
the women actually too dignified to relax.—J. B.

first-class civil war. We hate to suggest it, but
here is such material as revolutionists dream
of. Anything can happen. A glimpse into the
future reveals frightening possibilities.
What if the men boycott the women, refuse
to date them? Roble's doors will close every
night at dinner time, there will be no coke dates
leaving Lagunita, or any dates at all for that
matter. The men will hie their injured mascu
linity down the highway and take lonesome
solace in beer, or something worse.
Or perhaps the women will institute the boy
cott. "Sorry, she's not in," will be the only an
swer to a male voice on the telephone. Hefty
feminine guards will police Lagunita's doors and
shoo hopeful men away. The girls will stay
home and study, or whatever they do when
they're not out.
The whole situation is a little ridiculous, but
it has also an element of truth that makes it
worth considering. This world is reputed to be
a co-educational place, and it would seem wise
for Stanford's embittered sexes to get together
once in a while and forget their mad.
It is faintly reminiscent of the time when we
all said, "You can't play in my sand pile."
But in spite of Stanford's date phobia, tickets
for the Big Game Dance seem to be selling.
With four days yet to go, sale of the bids is

satisfactory, report the chairmen. The affair is a
natural for the night of the California-Stanford
epic, and will be well attended. The self-con
sciousness of Stanford daters won't jeopardize
it,
A large number of Stanford's so-far undated
1750 males will call a large number of Stan
ford's 700 undated women, sign them up for
Big Game night, and a menacing situation will
be averted.
That is, unless the men really are slow, and
the women actually too dignified to relax.—J. B.
