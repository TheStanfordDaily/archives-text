HELL-RAIDERS

I NTERFRATERNITY COUNCIL seems to think that
certain aspects of Hell Week could stand refinement.
Such outstanding proponents of the Stanford spirit as
Hortense, however, have turned thumbs down on any
reform of sophomore-hazing. On one side are the
humanitarian, spare-the-sophomore men. And on the
other side are the unrelenting advocates of building
Stanford manhood with the paddle.
A please-all compromise of this deadlock can read
ily be found by turning back to those handy Greeks
and Romans. Rather than subject their own citizens
to indignity, the kind-hearted ancients used to capture
great numbers of foreigners, whom they used or mis
used as they pleased.
Why shouldn't Stanford take a really conservative
turn and take its cue from the Greeks? Every autumn,
in anticipation of the Hell Week to come, Interfra
ternity Council could organize raiding parties. Armed
with paddles and stick-pins our warriors could make
sudden and terrifying sorties on the neighboring uni
versities. They could seize whole bands of Cal and
Santa Clara men, bind them, and ship them back to
the Farm.
Â»!< * * *
captured an ample pledge class of prison
ers, Stanford men could assert their authority at
prescribed times without endangering the backs of
their real pledge's laps. How convenient it would be
to have a subjugated flock of whipping-boys stored
in some convenient place, like the fraternity garage.
Each time an upperclassman felt the need of exerting
his authority he could summon a crew of the house's
captives.
He could paddle them, make them recite assorted
rituals, feed them intestine-distressing beverages, dump
them in the Livermore mountains blindfolded, and
make them bring various curios back to the house
on foot. This procedure would result in immeasurable
psychological advantage to the initiator. It would con
vince him that he is a superior person, make a real
honest-to-goodness Stanford man out of him, and sup
ply him with killingly funny diversion.
Meanwhile the sophomore pledges could sit back
and reflect on their good fortune in being members of
an organization so well-supplied with prisoners. And
yet, to impress them with the relative humility of
their lower-classman station, they would be deprived
of the right to run the Cal men through their paces.
But, of course, they could look forward to that man
hood-sustaining privilege as juniors.
From every standpoint the idea of initiating Cal
and Santa Clara men is satisfactory. And it probably
would do wonders for the "characters" of the prison
ers, too.
