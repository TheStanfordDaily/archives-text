THE TROUBLE WITH STANFORD WOMEN
rpHE EDITOR, SIR:
Mr. MellinkofFs Friday column again throws the
verbal battle between the Stanford men and women,
as to "why Stanford women don't," into the promi
nent spotlight. However, Mr. Mellinkoff seems to be
suffering under a slight misunderstanding; we mem
bers of the male contingent aren't trying to pick a
quarrel with our fairer sex, but merely trying to assist
the undated majority.
If Mr. Mellinkoff choses to call our blundering at
tempts to be helpful a battle, then we must quietly
conclude that the males have certainly taken the first
round. Take the recent S.C. excursion for an example;
there was certainly "big doings" in Los Angeles that
night, at least, for the Stanford Farm boys.
We had the pleasure of attending a few of the
bright spots, and in numerous places we found our
Stanford brethren with an outstanding array of good
looking feminine talent; Stanford women? No, unfor
tunately not, definitely not. Where was the poor Stan
ford woman that night?

JYJR. MELLINKOFF mentions your dignity, ladies, as
the reason for your backward, archaic attitude.
No, we're sure this isn't quite correct. The rest of
your race maintains dignity, and we respect you for
it. All we men arc asking for is a few of the human
qualities which make you so desirable in our eyes;
don't worry, we can still both maintain our dignity.
We're not choosing you to any battle; in fact, we
often sit and try to figure out ways to help your de
plorable situation. But why must it be, that every
week-end a majority of Stanford men pour San
Francisco and homeward-bound searching for some
thing which they don't find here?
It's not too late, there is still lots of time for you to
do something about it. Just be plain human beings,
Stanford women, and then sit back and gloal and talk
about your dignity, if you insist; but theie will be a
change. Just watch the rush.

BE KIND TO THE THEATER
TPHE EDITOR, SIR:
I herewith make a sincere and well meant plea,
and it is "Please, may we, the students of Stanford
University, use our own discretion and our own imagi
nation as to whether or not a play is good or bad?"
This is a subject very dear to me. I have been very
close to the theater here in this University for the
last six years, and I have had occasion to read a great
many reviews, some excellent, some so-so, and some
out-and-out failures.
Now, please don't misunderstand me. I believe in
reviews and critics, especially in the theater world.
But please, put a little sugar in those literary master
pieces. We are only students trying to satisfy our fel
low students. Moreover, we are trying to establish
the theater in a conspicuous position here on this
campus. You know that, Mr. Editor, because you have
been the foremost champion in this course. However,
you and I are destroying all that we have tried to
build vip if we allow destructive reviews to be printed.
We will keep the customers away, far away, from the
theater if this continues.
Therefore, Mr. Editor, let us be kind and gentle
to the theater. ( Lot's wait for the theater to dominate
the scene, and then maybe we can challenge it with
some good sharp criticisms. Then it will be able to
take it. Now it is like scolding a child. Yours for no
more "Baby Killing."
Sincerely,
. Jack Temple
