# French Flier Philosophizes In New Book
## 
### 
"Wind, Sand and Stars" by Antoine
de Saint Exupery
Count Antoine de Saint Exupery
is a French commercial flyer with a
gift for getting his philosophy down
on paper. And his business has
given him a chance to develop a way
of thinking about life which is mov
ing and full of compassion for his
fellow man.
In "Wind, Sand and Stars," Saint
Exupery writes his autobiography
from the time he entered aviation in
1926 until the end of the Spanish
civil war. But the autobiography is
just a peg on which he hangs his
musings about life, death, and men.
FLYER'S STORY
One of the most compelling chap
ters in the book is about a flyer
named Guillaumet who crashed in
the Andes. For live days and four
nights, he tramped his way through
the snows and treacherous crags
of the Andes, back to civilization.
When he was found, his hands and
feet were frozen, his body was
racked with cold and hunger, yet,
as Saint Exupery expresses it, "he
had too much pride in the machine
of his body to give up and die even
though his mind told him he had
done his best."
CRASHES IN SAHARA
Saint Exupery had an opportunity
to experience somewhat the same
emotions when he crashed in the
Sahara, and nearly died of thirst
before he was found. It's one thing
to endure such an experience, and
quite another to record, hour for
hour, the impressions of a dying
man. He succeeds in this, using a
distinct and terribly descriptive prose
with sureness and feeling.
In his fellow flyers, Saint Exupery
found the men he considered worthy
of the name "man." His standards
are high, to be sure, but for the men
who cannot measure up to them he
has pity, for he feels that in each of
us there is a little of, perhaps Mo
zart, or Guillaumet, but civilization
has murdered it.—Nowell
