# Hainan Movies To Be Viewed
## Smith to Present Tuesday Series Film 
### 
A moving picture appraisal of the
Japanese military and naval base
and a description of the very primi
tive people of the interior of Hainan
will be given by Nicol Smith, pho
tographer, tonight.
The film, "The Island of Hainan,"
will be presented by the Tuesday
Evening Series at 7:30 o'clock in
Memorial Hall.
ATTAINS SIGNIFICANCE
Hainan attained its significance
when the Japanese captured it for
fortification purposes. It breaks the
British defense line between Hong
Kong and Singapore and is only
750 miles from the Philippines.
The moving picture shows the Loi
and Miaos people of the interior as
being still very primitive. Children
ten years old or less work the fabu
lously rich tin mines of Hainan.
These children are used because the
mine corridors are so low and be
cause they will work for lower
wages.
PRAISED BY McNAMEE
Graham McNamee, news commen
tator, and Joseph O'Brien, Universal
Newsreel editor, have praised the
picture as one of the finest of its
kind.
Mr. Smith is a graduate of Stan
ford University, class of 1933. He
was a member of the Chi Psi fra
ternity and majored in history.
