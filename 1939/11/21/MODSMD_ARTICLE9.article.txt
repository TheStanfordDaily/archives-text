# Poll Shows Farm Men Not So Slow
## 1350 Roughs to Dale On Big Game Night, According to Survey 
### WILSON CANNON 
In indignant response to the thrust
that "Stanford men are slow," the
Farm's masculine element yesterday
responded, in telling fashion, to a
Daily cross-section poll, which re
vealed that approximately 1,350 of
Stanford's 3,000 men will be dating
on Big Game night.
Figures revealed that from the J
Row to Encina, the Farm's "eligible
bachelorhood," in a two to one ra
tio, will be escorting a dato during
the festivities of Big Game night.
Pith of the poll lies in the fact
that, while 700 Stanford women were
represented as being without escorts
in a poll conducted last week, more
Farm men than the number of wom
en registered in the University will
be dated the evening of the Stan
ford-California gridiron classic.
MALES HAVE PLANS
Further tabulation of yesterday's
figures showed that only a small
fraction of Stanford's 1,750 dateless
males would be remaining on the
campus Big Game nightâ€”dates or
no dates.
"We'll all be celebrating," was the
almost unanimous response.
And from Stanford's masculine
dating population, concensus holds
| to the statement that "the Big Game
dance is the answer to the Big Game
Night problem."
GRIER TO PLAY
With Jimmy Grier and his 17-
piece orchestra slated to play at the
A.S.S.U.-sponsored dance at Mill
brae Country Club in the first edi
tion of a dance that is expected to
become a yearly tradition, response
in ticket sales shows that the price
of $5 per couple is "okay with the
campus." At 5 o'clock yesterday 120
bids had been sold.
Price of the bid includes decora
tions, favors, and incidentals at
Millbrae, largest club on the Penin
sula. Dancing will be held from 10
to 2 o'clock. Dress will be informal.
To the "Stanford men are slow"
indictment, the Farm male gives his
answer.
