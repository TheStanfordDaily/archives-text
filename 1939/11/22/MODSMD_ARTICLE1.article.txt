### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
SEVENTEEN down and any num
k ber to go.
This was the "box score" in the
last four days of Europe's naval
World War. It's a pretty fair rec
ord for the Germans. In fact, it's
almost a shut-out, a no-hit, no-run
game. The Nazis have sent 17 ves
sels—British, French, and neutrals—
to the bottom of the ocean in just
four days. And British naval au
thorities accuse the Germans of
some "bad pitches"—the sowing of
floating or magnetic mines in "utter
disregard of international law."
Angered at her rough treatment at
the hands of the Hitler-men, Eng
land went to bat yesterday with a
new stancc that is designed to pro
duce a triple every time. It might
even be good for a home run. For
Great Britain ordered the seizure of
all German exports on the high
seas in reprisal for the "ruthless bru
tality of German methods."

"YESTERDAY'S announcement
meant just one thing: World
War II is essentially an economic
war. And it's a swift, stream
lined, fast-moving economic war.
Not until World War I had been
under way nearly three years did
Britain take such reprisal against
U-boat warfare and yesterday's
pronouncement was a clear indi
cation of the intense, incisive speed
of (lie second world struggle.
England's drastic decision to seize
and sink Germany's exports as well
as her imports, thereby denying the
Reich large amounts of foreign ex
change for purchase of vital raw
materials to carry on the war, was
reached after deliberate study by
Chamberlain and his war cabinet.
It was no ill-considered, hasty
scheme to slow Germany's war
juggernaut. It was part of a long
range attempt to cripple the NazLs
by shutting off their credit abroad
and halting import of goods through
destruction of Hitler's foreign ex
change.

UNGLAND has taken a tremen-
J dous drubbing on the seas;
and her retaliation must be both
swift and capable of attaining
loug-range results. With the en
forcement of this new policy, the
war on the seas may spread to the
Mediterranean, because many of
Germany's exports arc being
shipped overland through Austria
and the Brenner Pass to Italian
ports for shipment abroad.

Immediately British warships
will start halting all ships suspected
of carrying German exports, includ
ing neutral vessels bound for North
America, South America, and the
Far East.
And the protects will begin to
pour in. Italy, the Scandinavian
countries, Belgium, the Nether
lands will bombard Chamberlain
with diplomatic notes. "You can't
do this," they'll say. "What right
have you to stop neutral vessels
and search them? What reason
can you give for seizing goods that
are being carried away from, not
into, a belligerent country by a
neutral ship?"
But Chamberlain, the cheers of
the House of Commons still ringing
in his ears, will be firm in his pur
suit of England's new sea policy.
Conscious of his constituents' anger
at Germany's unethical sowing of
"wild" mine fields and the effective
ness of the Nazis' marauding sea
rovers, Chamberlain probably will
not. consider very seriously the
protests of the Continent's neutrals.
"They'll have to look out for them
selves. We're going to use every
possible means of defeating Hitler,"
is what he may say.
