# Climbing Scribe Views Terrain From Libe Top
## 
### BUD AMES 
That's the Daily policy. Always
go after the bare facts. Even if you
have to climb to the tenth floor of
the Hoover Library and look right
down into the Encina pools where,
a nasty rumor has it, the lads swim
"raw."
Well, what does the hygiene de
partment intend to do about it? Dr.
Thomas Storey, general director,
"didn't see much he could say about
the situation."
"I am, however, much against the
use of swimming trunks in the
pools," he stated. So far so good.
THIS WAY, CAL SCOUTS!
But the trouble doesn't end
there; oh my goodness no. From
the tenth floor you can peek right
down into the "secret" practice field
where Tiny's little lads are "dream
ing up" a raft of plays.
Next year, all the thick-bespec
tacled pencil and pad men can
come snooping down from rival
universities and under Ihe pretense
of doing some research in the pam
phlet department, they can scout,
our plays even before you could say
"Herbert Hoover."
THE VIEW'S FINE
And it doesn't end here. Goodness
no. There is the front of Branner
and Toyon, and the South side of
Sequoia, and R«ble and Lagunita
halls. It isn't a matter of peeking.
All you have to do is look out a
window and there you arc right in
the rooms of any of these halls.
Why, even on a calm day, you
can just about spit into the north
Encina rooms.
THERE ARE ADVANTAGSE
And now you can see baseball
games free, and so on, and so on.
Yep, it raises a lot of serious prob
lems.
But, of course, that's the bad side
of the situation. People are already
taking advantage of the library's
many advantages. We know, for a
fact, that some lads are taking their
lassies up there of evenings for a
glance at the view, which inci
dentally is something unimaginable.
What an awful Jot of work just for
a glance at the view.
Last Sunday, several persons took
the afternoon off and scaled the
metal beams all the way to the top.
It oozed candid camera men. Only
prerequisites for the climb are a
strong heart, a pair of tennis shoes,
a will—and a stimulant to keep
your heart strong when those planks
begin to sag under your weight.
CONTENTS NOTED
The view from the top — and
they're up about 180 feet now—is
well worth the effort. The Quad
proper looks like a shot from
"Beau Geste"; the Row like an ar
row of vegetation pointing toward
the bookstore. Looking a little like
a wart, the chapel is about the most
conspicuous building on the campus.
The top of the Hoover Libe? Well,
you will wonder what goes on up
there. It's littered with cigar
wrappers, hastily dropped rivet ma
chines, and little packages of rolled
salt from some lunch box.
And a printed circular urging
Californians to buy "season tickets
to the World's Fair." Even on top
of the library. Eleven wavey floors
above nothing. Somebody must
have a good publicity agent.

conspicuous building on the campus.
The top of the Hoover Libe? Well,
you will wonder what goes on up
there. It's littered with cigar
wrappers, hastily dropped rivet ma
chines, and little packages of rolled
salt from some lunch box.
And a printed circular urging
Californians to buy "season tickets
to the World's Fair." Even on top
of the library. Eleven wavey floors
above nothing. Somebody must
have a good publicity agent.
That's the Daily policy. Always
go after the bare facts. Even if you
have to climb to the tenth floor of
the Hoover Library and look right
down into the Encina pools where,
a nasty rumor has it, the lads swim
"raw."
Well, what does the hygiene de
partment intend to do about it? Dr.
Thomas Storey, general director,
"didn't see much he could say about
the situation."
"I am, however, much against the
use of swimming trunks in the
pools," he stated. So far so good.
THIS WAY, CAL SCOUTS!
But the trouble doesn't end
there; oh my goodness no. From
the tenth floor you can peek right
down into the "secret" practice field
where Tiny's little lads are "dream
ing up" a raft of plays.
Next year, all the thick-bespec
tacled pencil and pad men can
come snooping down from rival
universities and under Ihe pretense
of doing some research in the pam
phlet department, they can scout,
our plays even before you could say
"Herbert Hoover."
THE VIEW'S FINE
And it doesn't end here. Goodness
no. There is the front of Branner
and Toyon, and the South side of
Sequoia, and R«ble and Lagunita
halls. It isn't a matter of peeking.
All you have to do is look out a
window and there you arc right in
the rooms of any of these halls.
Why, even on a calm day, you
can just about spit into the north
Encina rooms.
THERE ARE ADVANTAGSE
And now you can see baseball
games free, and so on, and so on.
Yep, it raises a lot of serious prob
lems.
But, of course, that's the bad side
of the situation. People are already
taking advantage of the library's
many advantages. We know, for a
fact, that some lads are taking their
lassies up there of evenings for a
glance at the view, which inci
dentally is something unimaginable.
What an awful Jot of work just for
a glance at the view.
Last Sunday, several persons took
the afternoon off and scaled the
metal beams all the way to the top.
It oozed candid camera men. Only
prerequisites for the climb are a
strong heart, a pair of tennis shoes,
a will—and a stimulant to keep
your heart strong when those planks
begin to sag under your weight.
CONTENTS NOTED
The view from the top — and
they're up about 180 feet now—is
well worth the effort. The Quad
proper looks like a shot from
"Beau Geste"; the Row like an ar
row of vegetation pointing toward
the bookstore. Looking a little like
a wart, the chapel is about the most
conspicuous building on the campus.
