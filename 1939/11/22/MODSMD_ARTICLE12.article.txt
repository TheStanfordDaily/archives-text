What, may prove to be the last
.shipment of Rhesus monkeys from
India for several months, due to
the present war, was reeeived by
the bacteriology department of the
School of Medicine recently.
The most recent shipment of 200
monkeys will be used to further the
department's battle against polio
myelitis—the dread infantile* paraly
sis—being conducted under the su
pervision of Dr. Edwin M. Schultz,
who has fought "polio" for 12 years
in the research laboratories.
He is now gointf into his sixth
year of experimentation under funds
made possible through the presi
dent's annual appeal.
Fear that additional cargoes of the
animals will not be obtainable for
some time to come is based upon
hazardous shipping conditions caused
by the war.
Under ordinary circumstances the
total of .'5OO monkeys now housed in
the cages behind the bacteriology
building would bo sufficient for
five or six months of experimenta
tion. When these are gone, it. will be
practically impossible to secure
others.
