# Ex Committee Approves Undergraduate Support Of Stanford Fund Appeal
## Endowment Donors to Be Solicited By Student Canvassers for First Time in History of Yearly Drive 
### RICHARD DUDMAN 
After listening to a proposal brought by a member of the Board of
Trustees, a professor, and the managing editor of a San Franeiseo news
paper, Ex Committee voted unanimously last night to take an aetive port
this year in the annual appeal for the Stanford Fund.
Various aspects of the fund and the annual appeal were explained to
Ihe committee by Frank Walker, newly appointed member of the Board

of Trustees; Paul C. Edwards, chair
man of the appeal committee and
managing editor of the San Fran
cisco News; and Prof. Chilton R.
Rush, director of the Stanford Divi
sion of Journalism.
After Ex Committee had voted Its
approval, President Ken Cuthbort
son appointed a subcommittee con
sisting of Mollie West and Rnrney
Ferguson to make a study of the
exact methods by which students
will aid in the yearly drive.
STUDENTS TO SOLICIT
Student support of the appeal, held
in February and March of each year,
will take the form of canvassing
prospective donors by student repre
sentatives, according to Cuthbertson.
He emphasized the point that stu
dents will not be asked for financial
contribution to the fundâ€”except for
seniors, who liave been solicited dur
ing all three years the appeal has
been made.
Mi-. Edwards opened discussion of
the proposal, explaining (he reasons
for setting up the Stanford Fund
four years ago.
"Income from the University en
dowment was cut during tho de
pression," he pointed out, "and it.
was evident that normal growth of
the University was threatened."
FICiURES STATED
Explaining that funds gathered
through the appeal are used to cover
current expenses, he termed these
funds "income from a living endow
ment," He said that 2700 alumni
participated last year in the drive,
which brought in $48,000.
"We solicit your aid," he told the
students, "as one of the four mem
bers of the great Stanford family,
which includes faculty, trustees,
students, and alumni."
Professor Bush pointed out that
the proposed student participation 111
the fund drive would be valuable in
bringing them into touch with needs
and problems of the University.
NEW PROBLEM VIEWED
That the financial problem is com
mon to colleges and universities
throughout the country was the
contention of Mr. Walker. Showing
that the problem has arisen only
recently, he said he paid no tuition
as an undergraduate 22 years ago
and that Stanford alumni gather
ings until recently had discussed the
Big Game and the 1.C.4-A. meet, to
the exclusion of financial problems.
Mr. Walker blamed Stanford's
present financial condition on the
present federal administration.
"The government's policy of bor
rowing for spending and the unbal
anced budget have cut income from
Stanford's investments by 40 per
cent," he said.
"The policy of national reckless
ness has skyrocketed taxes so that
you cannot go into business today
I and accumulate a fortune like those
i that have formed our large endow-
I ments in the past."
