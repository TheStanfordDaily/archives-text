## 
### 
LONDON, Nov. 21 (UP).—A Ger
man bombing plane, and possibly
another Nazi air raider, were shot
down at sea today by British de
fense planes off the east coasi after
another invasion of the British Isles
by enemy reconnaissance planes.
Air raid alarms and gunfire con
tinued along the northeast coast of
I'jigland this evening, indicating that
still more German planes had been
sighted.
The British victory brought to at
least 20 the number of Na/.i planes
shot down since Field Marshal Her
mann W. Goering's German air
force raided the British Meet at the
Firth of Forth on Oct. 1(5 and dropped
the first, bombs on British soil.
ENEMY INVADES ISLES
Nazi planes roared over England,
Scotland and the Orkney Islands off
the tip of Scotland today for the
third successive day while swift
British "spitfire" fighters and anti
aircraft guns went into action against
them.
Air raid sirens screeched for an
hour and 20 minutes tonight in the
Dumber district on the east coast,
between Yorkshire and Lincoln
shire.
British planes went up in dark
ness and fought, several enemy air
craft observed over the H umber
area shortly after 7 p.m., the Air
Ministry said.
Tuesday night a British ship land
ed three German airmen at an east
coast port after they were picked up
from a collapsible rubber boat drift
ing in the North Sea.
CIVILIAN CRASH
The Air Ministry revealed be
latedly a British civilian plane
crashed, killing its two occupants,
when it flew into one of the balloon
barrages yesterday. Steel cables
dangle from the stationary balloons,
intended to snare enemy planes.
The intensified German aerial ac
tivity over the British Isles brought
a new warning to the people to
scurry for cover at the first sign of
enemy planes.
The War Office announced that,
effective Dec. 1, the Orkney and
Shetland Islands will become pro
hibited military areas.
A.s in previous Nazi flights, no
bombs were dropped anywhere to
day, but there were growing fears

■ that the Germans might be testing
out defenses for some lightning blow
at the British Isles.
The Air Ministry announced that
the plane shut down off Deal on the
east coast, presumably where a Nazi
bomber sped to the outskirts of Lon
don Monday, was a grey-blue Dor
nier-17, a twin-engine reconnais
sance bomber known as "the flying
pencil,"
The fact that the plane, like one
shot down at the Firth of Forth, was
a Dornier indicated that the Ger
i mans are saving their newest and
| best bombers for more important
1 missions. Some of the Dorniers are
i commercial flying boats converted
into bombers.
