# Farm Aviation Class Increase Expected Soon
## Permission Subject To Purchase of Two Planes, Larger Staff 
### 
In the near future Stanford will
probably be allowed by the Civil
Aeronautics Authority to admit 20
more students to its aeronautics
course, according to Dr. David L.
Webster, instructor of the course.
Permission from C.A.A., according
to Dr. Webster, is subject to the
conditions that the University pur
chase two more planes, that two
more instructors be appointed, and
that, provision be made lor the new
students to do make-up work in
the ground school in order to catch
up with the remainder of the class.
QUOTA MUST BE FILLED
Because make-up work will have
to be done in special classes, the ex
pense will be too great unless there
are enough students.
If special classes are given, it will
not be necessary to limit ground
school to those who fly this term.
Students who have completed ground
school work will be preferred for
flying next year, Webster said.
PLANS STILL TENTATIVE
The C.A.A. has changed its rule
so that if a student obtains a place
in flight instruction due to a va
cancy, he will not have to pay lor
the former student's instruction to
date.
Because of the very tentative
basis of these plans and because they
are dependent upon the number of
students applying, anyone interested
is requested to please get in touch
with Dr. Webster as soon as possible.
