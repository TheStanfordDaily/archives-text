# Democrats Plan New Deal Reform
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Nov. 21 (UP).â€”
President Roosevelt left today for
Warm Springs, Ga., amid growing
indications he will temper spending
and other New Deal policies at the
next session of Congress in an ef
fort to achieve democratic harmony
before the 1940 election.
Legislative leaders expect the Ad
ministration program to be brief
and not as controversial as those of
the last six years. It probably will
be topped by an expanded national
defense measure and a proposal to
widen benefits under the Social Se
curity law.
Unless something transpires be
fore Congress meets on Jan. 3 to
change the picture, general revision
of the revenue laws probably will
not be undertaken before the
election.
