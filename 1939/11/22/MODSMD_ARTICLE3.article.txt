# Nazis Blame Murder Try On British
## Germans Arrest Two English Agents In Beer Cellar Bombing 
### United Press 
Hcinrich Himmlcr's Nazi Gestapo
announced Tuesday night the Mu
nich beer cellar bombing and at
tempt to assassinate Adolf Hitler two
weeks ago had been branded as a
"British crime" by the confession of
a 36-year-old German.
The Germans announced the ar
rest of two men described as high
officers of the British secret service
who were said to have tried to stir
up a revolution in Germany. The
Britons, identified only as a "Mr.
Best" and a "Captain Stevens," were
not linked directly with the Mu
nich bombing.
AN NO I NCE CONFESSION
The announcements of the con
fession of the obscure German, Georg
Elser, and the seizing of the British
secret agents—made separately but
nevertheless timed to coincide—read
like a detective thriller and Himmler
himself proudly described the Mu
nich bombing denouement as a thing
"unprecedented in the history of
crime."
"The instigators and those'who
supplied the money for the under
taking (the bombing) were the Brit
ish intelligence service," he said.
BLAME BRITISH
The Germans made it clear that
they regarded Elser as merely the
dupe. They said the British secret
service instigated the crime and that
its directing genius was Otto Stras
ser, a refugee anti-Nazi now in
France.
The British government laughed
off Germany's accusation, saying
neither the government nor its in
telligence agents had any part in the
attempt to kill Hitler.
BRITISH TO SEIZE GOODS
Secondary in headline interests to
the German disclosures but undoubt
edly far more portentous was Brit
ain's announcement Tuesday that all
German exports on the high seas
will be seized in reprisal for Ger
many's alleged "ruthless brutality"
blamed for the wave of ship sink
ings. Not until the World War was
nearly three years under way did
Britain resort to such measures.
The announcement was made as
the 11,930-ton Japanese liner Teru
kuni went down within sight of the
English east coast, victim of a mine.
The ship's passengers and crew es
caped.
NEUTRALS ANGRY
Reaction from the neutrals was in
angry tones. The Netherlands and
Belgium, who already have suffered
in lives and ships from the war of
blockade, said enormous hardships
would be inflicted upon them. The
Scandinavian states felt the same
way.
The British move threatened to
spread the war to the Mediterranean,
since many of Germany's exports are
sent overland to Italian ports for
shipment.
