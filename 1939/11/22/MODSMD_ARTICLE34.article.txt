# Axe-Hungry Card Varsity To Work Out with Frosh
## Donahue Expected to Practice; May Be Included in Game Line-up 
### JERRY BRUCKER 
With the deadline almost here, the Axe-hungry Indian griddcrs will
work against Cal plays as run by the frosh eleven in practice this afternoon.
A scrimmage is scheduled, but it's improbable that Tiny Thornhill will
give his injury-ridden squad much rough work with the Big Game only
three days away.
Corky Donahue, big right tackle who has been out with a knee injury.

is expected to be out for
today. Donahue has been on the
shelf since the Santa Clara game,
and is a big question mark as far
as the Big Game is concerned.
Whether or not he will play de- i
pends largely on how he looks if he 1
is able to come out for practice •
today.
STANDLEE WILL PASS
As Pete Kmetovic is tentatively
the starting left half, Norm Standlee
is being groomed to take over the
passing duties usually handled by
Frankie Albert or Moon Mullin. The
Chief will provide the power threat
in the starting backfield, while Pete |
Kmetovic and Hugh Gallarneau are ,
the speed-burners.
Swede Johansen was working at |
right tackle again yesterday. Ex- j
pected to hold down a regular tackle ■
position before the season started, j
Johansen proved too inexperienced i
for the job, so Donahue was shifted :
over from guard.
CARD TACKLES WEAK
Unless Donahue is able to play a
good part of the Cal game, the In
dians will be without an experienced
tackle to stop Lopin' Louie Smith's
weak side slants.
Stan Graff, who missed practice
Monday because of an ctnkle injury
in the Washington State game, was
back at his regular left end spot last
night, looking none the worse for
wear.
Chick Orme held down right
guard, and seems to be a definite
.starter at that position.
Last night's practice session was
spent running through plays against
imaginary opponents, and checking
assignments.
