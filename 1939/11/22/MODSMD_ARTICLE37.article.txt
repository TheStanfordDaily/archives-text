# Card Harriers Lose to Bears
## Cal Captain Vollmer Takes First Place 
### 
Ted Vollmer, California captain,
won the cross-country grind yester
day afternoon; but the real battle
was for second plÂ«ce when Stan
Sadaj, the Bears' star distance man,
barely eked out Jack Moore by a
one-second margin.
Coming into the last, yards, of the,
four-mile route out at the Stanford
golf course, Sadaj poured it on and
finished in 20:20.2, a step ahead of
Moore. Vollmer ran a fine race and
finished quite a bit ahead of the
field.
Cal won the race with 18 points as
against Stanford's 40. Cross-coun
try is like golf, the lowest man win
ning. Stanford, in one of its best
\ showings in several years, was no
match for the undefeated Bears.
Other Stanford entries finished in
the following places:
P. Moore, seventh; Girard, eighth;
Seed, eleventh; and Skrable, thir
! teenth. Only the first ten places
counted.
