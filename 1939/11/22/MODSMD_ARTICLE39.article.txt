## Firehouse Captures Grid Crown with 19-6 Victory Monte Pfyl Sparks Blaze Chasers As Zetes Taken by Aerial Attack 
### JERRY MAYER, Sports Editor 
Led by flashy Monte Pfyl, who
1 had a running and passing field day,
1 I he smooth - functioning Firehouse
! team yesterday ran wild to knock
j over the Zeta Psi seven by a score
of 19 to G to cop the Stanford intra
mural grid crown. The victors played
| much steadier ball than they did the
day before.
1 Starting in midfield where a poor
punt by the Zetes' Howard Hicking
bothain had gone out of bounds,
! the boys who chase the blazes started
to roll, with Monte Pfyl as the mo
i tivating power.
Pfyl tossed to Charlie Farrell and
then to Tom Collins to advance the
: ball to the Zete 31, then made a
beautiful fake ot an end run,
1 straightened up and tossed to Col-
I lins on the Zete 9.
From that point Pfyl flipped a
quick one to Farrell in the right flat
I for the score. The Pfyl to Pfyl pass
i combination clicked for the extra
j point.
Frank Pfyl stepped into the lime
! light to start the ball rolling for the

I next tally when he intercepted "Coo
| tie" Thompson's pass and rambled
i back to midfield. On second down
! Jimmy McCloud went into the tail
i back spot and threw a long pass to
i Motile Pfyl, who stole the ball from
j Thompson's outstretched hands and
j ran to the Zete 2-yard line before
j he was stopped. Monte hit the mid
j die of the line to the 6-inch line and
j then with time left for only one play
| fired to brothel Frank in the right
i flat for 6 points. The score caught
the entire Zete secondary flatfooted.
The final Firehouse score came a
few minutes later when Monte Pfyl
threw a long pass to Frank Pfyl, who
grabbed the ball without breaking
his stride as the oval skipped off the
fingertips of Zete Bill Lee.
The Zetes made a final rally which
netted G points when Thompson
fired a pass half the length of the
field to Lee who was stopped on the
Firehouse 6-yard line. On the next
play Thompson, on a fake end run,
threw to Simpson for the lone Zete
score.

mural grid crown. The victors played
| much steadier ball than they did the
day before.
1 Starting in midfield where a poor
punt by the Zetes' Howard Hicking
bothain had gone out of bounds,
! the boys who chase the blazes started
to roll, with Monte Pfyl as the mo
i tivating power.
Pfyl tossed to Charlie Farrell and
then to Tom Collins to advance the
: ball to the Zete 31, then made a
beautiful fake ot an end run,
1 straightened up and tossed to Col-
I lins on the Zete 9.
From that point Pfyl flipped a
quick one to Farrell in the right flat
I for the score. The Pfyl to Pfyl pass
i combination clicked for the extra
j point.
Frank Pfyl stepped into the lime
! light to start the ball rolling for the

I next tally when he intercepted "Coo
| tie" Thompson's pass and rambled
i back to midfield. On second down
! Jimmy McCloud went into the tail
i back spot and threw a long pass to
i Motile Pfyl, who stole the ball from
j Thompson's outstretched hands and
j ran to the Zete 2-yard line before
j he was stopped. Monte hit the mid
j die of the line to the 6-inch line and
j then with time left for only one play
| fired to brothel Frank in the right
i flat for 6 points. The score caught
the entire Zete secondary flatfooted.
The final Firehouse score came a
few minutes later when Monte Pfyl
threw a long pass to Frank Pfyl, who
grabbed the ball without breaking
his stride as the oval skipped off the
fingertips of Zete Bill Lee.
The Zetes made a final rally which
netted G points when Thompson
fired a pass half the length of the
field to Lee who was stopped on the
Firehouse 6-yard line. On the next
play Thompson, on a fake end run,
threw to Simpson for the lone Zete
score.
Led by flashy Monte Pfyl, who
1 had a running and passing field day,
1 I he smooth - functioning Firehouse
! team yesterday ran wild to knock
j over the Zeta Psi seven by a score
of 19 to G to cop the Stanford intra
mural grid crown. The victors played
| much steadier ball than they did the
