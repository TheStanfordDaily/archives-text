# Southern Grid Expert Offers Bowl Solution
## Small College Teams Would Settle Status At Close of Season 
### 
NEW ORLEANS, Nov. 21 (UP).—
Paul B. Williamson, football prog
nosticator, tonight suggested "one
or more" post season games to set
tle supremacy among the minor
gridiron powers.
"Some of these so-called minor
teams have enviable records, some j
undefeated and untied and would !
be tough opposition for their big ;
brothers," Williamson said. "They |
are teams that have large follow- ,
ings, teams that draw crowds up to
40,000."
For instance, it would be impos- j
sible to get a fair contest by match-
ing Pop Warner's San Jose State j
and Slippery Pock, both undefeated
and untied in their own leagues.
"... San Jose State and Fresno j
State, out on the West Coast, are |
football powers for reckoning in any
man's appraisal," Williamson said.
These teams, just outside the realm |
of the "majors," meet at Fresno j
Thursday night.
Williamson suggested the winner j
be matched in a "bowl" against j
some eastern teachers college—such
as Marysville, Mo., Teachers or
Louisiana Normal,
