# One-Fourth Awakes
## 
### 
LAST night representative members of three
branches of the Stanford family, the trus
tees, the faculty, and the alumni, requested the
aid of the fourth, the student body.
They appeared before Ex Committee to ask
for undergraduate co-operation in the annual
Stanford fund driveâ€”not merely for this year,
but for every year to come. Seeking no money
from the students, the heads of the appeal de
sire only help in obtaining donations from in
terested alumni and friends of Stanford.
And Ex Committee wholeheartedly has prom
ised its support.
The financial situation of Stanford is no differ
ent from that of every other privately endowed
university in the country. With rising prices and
sinking interest rates, the original endowment
today can accomplish only half the work it did
50 years ago. If it is to continue operating on
its present scale, Stanford must make up the
difference.
Huge grants of $1,000,000 and upward are
far more scarce today than they were in the
early part of the century. The policy of the
federal government has made it impossible for
men to accumulate great fortunes from which
they can lavish gifts on educational and philan
thropic institutions.
Today the University is forced to depend on
many small and medium-sized contributions
rather than a few large ones.
It is for the purpose of collecting these sums
that the Stanford Fund appeal is made. The
hundreds of small donations that are made each
year take the place of the annual income the
University would receive from a doubled en
dowment.
No student or alumnus of Stanford is under
any obligation to take part in this movement.
It merely provides an opportunity for graduates
and friends of the University to show their ap
preciation of it and their interest in it. They
receive no reward, other than personal satis
faction, these men and women who spend hours
each day campaigning for funds and who do
nate their money to the school.
It is the students who are attending Stanford
today who reap the benefits.
Therefore, it does not seem out of order for
the other three branches of the family to ask
the undergraduates for a little help with their
work.
The valuable experience in administration
and in personal contacts and interviews with
outstanding people that such activities offer the
student are obvious.
But even more important is the fact that they
give Stanford men and women a chance to help
their University while they are still part of it.
