A SHIPMENT of 200 Rhesus monkeys was
received here at Stanford yesterday—and
it was the biggest news of the day, in impor
tance if not in ostentation.
These 200 monkeys will be added to the
300 already in cages in the biology buildings,
and Stanford's greatest experiment for the
benefit of mankind will continue: the attempt
to find a cure for infantile paralysis.
And you can say that these experiments are
being handled by Dr. Edwin M. Schultz, who
has worked against "polio" for the last twelve
years, and that the experiments he is doing now
have been financed largely through donations
received in response to Dr. Wilbur's annual
appeal for funds. And that this current ship
ment is the largest received in several months,
and that Dr. Schultz and his staff have enough
monkeys on hand to continue their research
for another six months or so.
But there the favorable things you can say
stop.

At that point you have to stop being opti
mistic, and point out that it is feared that this
shipmen is the last which may come from India
lor an indefinite period; that 12 years of re
search may be stopped until—when?
It is becoming too dangerous to ship a load
of monkeys on the high seas. It is too likely that
their ship may be attacked, and that they will
be sent to the bottom of the ocean.
Twelve years devoted to trying to do a favor
for mankind, only to find that mankind isn't
really very interested. Mankind has other
more important things to think of; brand new
ways to kill itself, for instance.
No, General Sherman was wrong about war.
If you look at it right, war is amusing; awfully
amusing.—D. J.
