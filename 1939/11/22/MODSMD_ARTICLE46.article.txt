### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
DIES DIES HARD
|> AKNUM and Bailey certainly passed up a rare per
former when they let Congress get Martin Dies
away from them. That clown has spent over $200,000
in putting on one of the rarest shows in Washington.
In fact, if it were not the taxpayers' money and our
national legislature's time the antics would be laugh
able. But the sad truth is that this political acrobat
is not working for Barnum and Bailey or the King
ling Brothers. He is being paid by the people of Texas,
and United States currency is appropriated to support
what seems to be a Dies Committee to publicize Dies.
What other motive could explain the accusation that
Shirley Temple is implicated in seditious and revo
lutionary plots to overthrow the government? Well,
there are a number of possibilities. One is that the
self-inspiring Texan is suffering front buck-fever,
political hallucinations, or intellectual gas pains. But
whatever the sickness, the prognosis is not very en
couraging. Every day in every way Dies is getting
loonier and loonier.
His latest assault upon American intelligence has
been to accuse Rockwell Kent, the famous artist, of
being a communist. The fact that Kent denies the
charge and that Dies, as usual, has no proof whatever
for his statements doesn't seem to bother old Madcap
Martin in the least. He is still getting publicity, and I
suppose he is still satisfied.
$ * >1* *
|>UT the amazing thing about the Dies Committee is
that the rest of Congress tolerates it. There cer
tainly are enough comedians in the country without
paying a Texas representative to make an ass of him
self. There are the Marx Brothers, the Kitz Brothers,
Fred Allen, and there will soon be another picture star
ring Charlie Chaplin. With such a wide assortment of
people to laugh at, it is a little hard to understand
how Dies gets his drawing power.
But as long as Congress continues to support their
ace buffoon, he ought to be put to work on something
more in keeping with his abilities. He has been going
for years now on his amateur detective game, and so
far his so-called work has been about as productive
as a herd of legless geldings.
If Congress feels so desperately in need of a jester,
it might be better to just buy Martin a cap and bells
and pay him to cavort in long, dry sessions. Such rol
licking sport would no doubt appeal to a great au
dience. And maybe Hollywood, anxious to please the
public, would sign Dies up and co-star him with
Laurel and Hardy. Shirley Temple as the picture's
heroine would lend dramatic ajjpeal, as she would be
tensely playing opposite her former accuser.
But right now it looks like Congress is jealously
guarding their Martin. And Martin dies hard.

guarding their Martin. And Martin dies hard.
DIES DIES HARD
|> AKNUM and Bailey certainly passed up a rare per
former when they let Congress get Martin Dies
away from them. That clown has spent over $200,000
in putting on one of the rarest shows in Washington.
In fact, if it were not the taxpayers' money and our
national legislature's time the antics would be laugh
able. But the sad truth is that this political acrobat
is not working for Barnum and Bailey or the King
ling Brothers. He is being paid by the people of Texas,
and United States currency is appropriated to support
what seems to be a Dies Committee to publicize Dies.
What other motive could explain the accusation that
Shirley Temple is implicated in seditious and revo
lutionary plots to overthrow the government? Well,
there are a number of possibilities. One is that the
self-inspiring Texan is suffering front buck-fever,
political hallucinations, or intellectual gas pains. But
whatever the sickness, the prognosis is not very en
couraging. Every day in every way Dies is getting
loonier and loonier.
His latest assault upon American intelligence has
been to accuse Rockwell Kent, the famous artist, of
being a communist. The fact that Kent denies the
charge and that Dies, as usual, has no proof whatever
for his statements doesn't seem to bother old Madcap
Martin in the least. He is still getting publicity, and I
suppose he is still satisfied.

that the rest of Congress tolerates it. There cer
tainly are enough comedians in the country without
paying a Texas representative to make an ass of him
self. There are the Marx Brothers, the Kitz Brothers,
Fred Allen, and there will soon be another picture star
ring Charlie Chaplin. With such a wide assortment of
people to laugh at, it is a little hard to understand
how Dies gets his drawing power.
But as long as Congress continues to support their
ace buffoon, he ought to be put to work on something
more in keeping with his abilities. He has been going
for years now on his amateur detective game, and so
far his so-called work has been about as productive
as a herd of legless geldings.
If Congress feels so desperately in need of a jester,
it might be better to just buy Martin a cap and bells
and pay him to cavort in long, dry sessions. Such rol
licking sport would no doubt appeal to a great au
dience. And maybe Hollywood, anxious to please the
public, would sign Dies up and co-star him with
Laurel and Hardy. Shirley Temple as the picture's
heroine would lend dramatic ajjpeal, as she would be
tensely playing opposite her former accuser.
