(Reading time, one minute four seconds)
r rHE EDITOR. SIR:
Usually we aren't the type to complain about
such a moth-eaten subject as social morals, but a
situation is arising on campus which is just one step
and a half over the mark. Please digest the following
episode.
While indulging in a carefree half hour of "water
dogging it around - ' in the men's swimming pools, my
friend and I retired to a reasonably dry area near the
water to allow the sun to dry our tired limbs. Re
laxation, you know, is the spice of life. Almost in the
required state of coma, both of us were shocked by a
fact so significant and stunning that for three seconds
we were at loss for comment.
Yes, it was true. The steel workers on the Hoover
Libe were ogling down from their perch like so many
ill-mannered gargoyles. Now what, we wish to know
is: on completion of this mooring mast, will we as
lovers of nature be forced to swim in lace, or shall
field glasses and females be banned from a line placed
at the fifth floor level?
Another remedy would be to push the tower back a
few paces—but that would be impractical, wouldn't it?
Modestly yours,
Adolfo Arias
Dana Winters
P.S. Wow?
