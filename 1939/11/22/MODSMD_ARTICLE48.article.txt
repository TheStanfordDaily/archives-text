# WHAT'S BECOME OF TRADITION?
## 
### 
r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
Shades of eternal damnation? Wh;it to do? Will
they never learn? What I am getting at is the seem
ing lack of care on tho part of certain people in the
University for the traditions that have been a part of
this school for more years than most of them have
been alive.
I wouldn't want to come right out and say it, but
I have a sneaking hunch that the freshmen, the Class
of '43, are the major offenders in this respect. Maybe
they just don't know that we don't smoke on the
Quad. I don't doubt there are other seniors in the
school that feel the same way that I do about this. We
have respected tradition for lo these many years and
it does seem too much for us to expect the same from
people who will be seniors in our place some day—
God bless them.

CMOKING is not the only thing that this writer has
noticed. Men are the greatest offenders in this
item but the women are also getting in' their licks at
this 'down with tradition' drive. F3obby socks with no
silken shank covers with them is the main 'crime' of
the women. Roble-iills whose ears are burning, I
mean you! You will find that when they get in a
house that the sisters will take things into their own
hands and gently suggest that silk stockings be worn.
All kidding aside, both these things look like the
dickens to those who have been around here long
enough to expect that tradition be respected as it has
in the past. That is one of the things that makes
Stanford stand out ;is a more unified school than Cal.
We have our individualism, but we are not too proud
to respect tradition that has been set by those who
have gone before us.
How's about it?
