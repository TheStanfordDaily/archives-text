# Colorful Hapsburgs Offer Basis for Harding Triology
## 
### 
''IMPERIAL TWILIGHT." by Bertita Harding.
There's something about royalty and their doings thai spells romance
to the rest of lis commoners, and each of Europe's royal houses has a
fascinating history. But for sheer color, you cannot beat the Hapsburgs,
whose long and intricate history has been inextricably interwoven with
Europe's history—past and present. ♦

It is in this, the oldest of the mod
ern dynasties, that Bertita Harding
has found material for three books,
the latest being "Imperial Twilight."
In "Phantom Crown," the story of
Maximilian and Ca rlotfti of Mexico,
she wrote of the ill-fated Hapsburg
couple who were duped by Napo
leon 111 into attempting the rule of
Mexico. Franz Joseph and Elizabeth
of Austria were the subjects of her
second book, "Golden Fleece."
THIRD BOOK TIMELY
"Imperial Twilight" is the third
of the trilogy. Carrying the Haps
burg saga up to the Munich crisis,
the book, though it tells of events
closest to us in time, still seems the
least familiar, for present-day dic
tators have managed to overshadow
ex-kings in search of thrones.
The tale of Karl and Zita of Hun
gary would be a sad one, if it were
not for the magnificent way they
met their defeat. Karl was third in
line of succession for the Austro-
Hungarian throne at the time of
Crown Prince Rudolph's, mysterious
death at Mayerling. With the assas
sination of Archduke Ferdinand, at
Sarajevo, he became first, in line,
and succeeded to the dual crown
when old Franz Joseph died in 1916.
Pressure from the allied powers,
made it impossible for the Hungar
ians to risk further dismemberment,
by permitting him to assume the
throne. Karl and Zita were sent
into exile in Switzerland, and Ad
miral Horthy became regent for a
king who was not allowed to rule.
EMPRESS ZITA AMBITIOUS
Empress Zita was an ambitious
woman, and she forced her ill and
disillusioned husband to make two
futile attempts to gain his rightful
p}ace in Hungary* There is no
doubt that the people wanted him,
and Horthy, too, but outside pres
sure was too great.
Karl died in a poverty-stricken
exile on the island of Madeira, but
Zita continued her scheming in be
half of her son, the pretender
Arch-duke Otto. Until the Anschluss
her chances seemed good, but today
she sees little hope, and she and
her large family live in a drafty
Belgian castle dreaming of the day
when the Hapsburgs will return tc
what they have never ceased to con
sider their rightful place.
Miss Harding was able to con
tact personally most of the people
concerned in this book, and for this
reason, its authenticity cannot, be
questioned. A thorough knowledge
of her subject and an ability tc
write well and interestingly make
"Imperial Twilight" far more Ihar
a historical biography.
This is a picture of tumultous
events of our times seen through
the eyes of two idealistic people
born to rule, who were unable tc
cope with the swift march of events
from 1914 on. —Nowell

from 1914 on. —Nowell
''IMPERIAL TWILIGHT." by Bertita Harding.
There's something about royalty and their doings thai spells romance
to the rest of lis commoners, and each of Europe's royal houses has a
fascinating history. But for sheer color, you cannot beat the Hapsburgs,
whose long and intricate history has been inextricably interwoven with
Europe's history—past and present. ♦

It is in this, the oldest of the mod
ern dynasties, that Bertita Harding
has found material for three books,
the latest being "Imperial Twilight."
In "Phantom Crown," the story of
Maximilian and Ca rlotfti of Mexico,
she wrote of the ill-fated Hapsburg
couple who were duped by Napo
leon 111 into attempting the rule of
Mexico. Franz Joseph and Elizabeth
of Austria were the subjects of her
second book, "Golden Fleece."
THIRD BOOK TIMELY
"Imperial Twilight" is the third
of the trilogy. Carrying the Haps
burg saga up to the Munich crisis,
the book, though it tells of events
closest to us in time, still seems the
least familiar, for present-day dic
tators have managed to overshadow
ex-kings in search of thrones.
The tale of Karl and Zita of Hun
gary would be a sad one, if it were
not for the magnificent way they
met their defeat. Karl was third in
line of succession for the Austro-
Hungarian throne at the time of
Crown Prince Rudolph's, mysterious
death at Mayerling. With the assas
sination of Archduke Ferdinand, at
Sarajevo, he became first, in line,
and succeeded to the dual crown
when old Franz Joseph died in 1916.
Pressure from the allied powers,
made it impossible for the Hungar
ians to risk further dismemberment,
by permitting him to assume the
throne. Karl and Zita were sent
into exile in Switzerland, and Ad
miral Horthy became regent for a
king who was not allowed to rule.
EMPRESS ZITA AMBITIOUS
Empress Zita was an ambitious
woman, and she forced her ill and
disillusioned husband to make two
futile attempts to gain his rightful
p}ace in Hungary* There is no
doubt that the people wanted him,
and Horthy, too, but outside pres
sure was too great.
Karl died in a poverty-stricken
exile on the island of Madeira, but
Zita continued her scheming in be
half of her son, the pretender
Arch-duke Otto. Until the Anschluss
her chances seemed good, but today
she sees little hope, and she and
her large family live in a drafty
Belgian castle dreaming of the day
when the Hapsburgs will return tc
what they have never ceased to con
sider their rightful place.
Miss Harding was able to con
tact personally most of the people
concerned in this book, and for this
reason, its authenticity cannot, be
questioned. A thorough knowledge
of her subject and an ability tc
write well and interestingly make
"Imperial Twilight" far more Ihar
a historical biography.
This is a picture of tumultous
events of our times seen through
the eyes of two idealistic people
born to rule, who were unable tc
cope with the swift march of events
from 1914 on. —Nowell
