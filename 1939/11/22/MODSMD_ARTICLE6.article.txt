# Antioch Head Stresses Need Of Experience

"Instead of just taking jugs and
filling them with water, we try to
make them into steam engines."
In drawing this analogy yesterday,
Dr. A. D. Henderson, president of
Antioch College, was explaining
the objective of education at An
tioch: to give the student academic
theory plus an active personal expe
rience gained through holding a job.
Dr. Henderson, who has been
president of Antioch for three years
and a member of the faculty for 14
years, is taking advantage <>* his
sabbatical leave to visit the Pacific
Coast and make a few inquiries into
the philosophy of Jbusmess enter
prise. He will .speak beforw Lunch
eon Club today and intends to treat
fully the principles under which
education at Antioch is adminis
tered.
EACH STI'DENT HAS JOB
In requiring that each student fill
a temporary job outside the college,
the administration at Antioch finds
it necessary to maintain a complete
employment servict', according to Dr.
Henderson. "We have one student
(ill a job part of the time and then
another student takes over the same i
job. In this way we are always re
sponsible for filling that one job."
Although Antioch, which is in
Ohio, is the only co-educational
school in the country which has de
veloped this particular type of edu- |
cation to anything approaching its]
full extent. Dr. Henderson com- '
merited that the principles of the
method are now being applied at
Bennington school for girls in Ver
mont.
CHARACTERIZES SYSTEM
"The Bennington theory as applied
in some departments there is very
nearly identical with that in use at
Antioch. This i.s true in particular
of the social science department
there. Bennington students, how
ever, receive no salary for most of
the outside work they do."
Characterizing the Antioch system
i as primarily a "tempering process,"
j Dr. Henderson said, "We are trying
j to equip the student with the ca
] pacity to make the most out of the
I present and to live in the future."

employment servict', according to Dr.
Henderson. "We have one student
(ill a job part of the time and then
another student takes over the same i
job. In this way we are always re
sponsible for filling that one job."
Although Antioch, which is in
Ohio, is the only co-educational
school in the country which has de
veloped this particular type of edu- |
cation to anything approaching its]
full extent. Dr. Henderson com- '
merited that the principles of the
method are now being applied at
Bennington school for girls in Ver
mont.
CHARACTERIZES SYSTEM
"The Bennington theory as applied
in some departments there is very
nearly identical with that in use at
Antioch. This i.s true in particular
of the social science department
there. Bennington students, how
ever, receive no salary for most of
the outside work they do."
Characterizing the Antioch system
i as primarily a "tempering process,"
j Dr. Henderson said, "We are trying
j to equip the student with the ca
] pacity to make the most out of the
I present and to live in the future."
