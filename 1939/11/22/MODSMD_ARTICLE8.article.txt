"The Gaieties are going to be su
perlative this year. Why, man, they
can't help it. We've got all the old
hands back, aged in the wood, and a
lot of new blood besides," Marco
Thome, the Chappie's Old Boy,
gave the Big Game Gaieties of 1939
a press "blurb."
Marco, himself a Gaieties three
timer, was lurking behind the drops
on stage right of Memorial Theater,
waiting for his pantomime numbers
to go on in the first complete show
rehearsal Monday evening. Round
the old boy scurried innumerable
stage hands, prop girls setting
scenes, clearing scenes, and actors
just generally getting in the way.
Momentarily the back-stage hus
tle had quieted down while the big
revolving stage brought Bob Stevens
in view to croon "So Long to
the darkened house.
"Okay," someone on stage left
shouted. The spots dimmed and
came on full again to show a glee
club giving their all to the chorus of
Steven's number.
"And look at that revolving stage,"
Thorne rhapsodized. "It's a work of
genius. It's making the show the
smoothest thing on wheels — and
listen to the mike, it's perfect! And
the recording systlem, why I'm hav
ing my numbers recorded, even."
The fact that Thome's numbers
are pantomimes, with the assistance
of Bobbe Harris, on Stanford tradi
tions isn't bothering the ancient edi
tor. He claims he will be able to
hear his audience reaction, literally,
for the first time.
' "The Gaieties are really a Stan
j ford show this year," Thorne as-
I serted. "There's none of that imi
] tation Hollywood stuff, it's not built
|on splendor but on humor. The
show is accenting the Big Game
week-end, you might call it a dra
matic review of the week-end."
The curtain came down on the
glee club, and Stevens, and the
stage manager dashed up, berating
Thorne for not giving him a list of
his props. The Chappie's man of all
work started off for stage center.
"Hey," he yelled back, "don't for
get to say the finale—that's the big
mystery number—is the best thing
in the show. Muheim wrote it, the
whole cast is in it, and it's terrific!"

perlative this year. Why, man, they
can't help it. We've got all the old
hands back, aged in the wood, and a
lot of new blood besides," Marco
Thome, the Chappie's Old Boy,
gave the Big Game Gaieties of 1939
a press "blurb."
Marco, himself a Gaieties three
timer, was lurking behind the drops
on stage right of Memorial Theater,
waiting for his pantomime numbers
to go on in the first complete show
rehearsal Monday evening. Round
the old boy scurried innumerable
stage hands, prop girls setting
scenes, clearing scenes, and actors
just generally getting in the way.
Momentarily the back-stage hus
tle had quieted down while the big
revolving stage brought Bob Stevens
in view to croon "So Long to
the darkened house.
"Okay," someone on stage left
shouted. The spots dimmed and
came on full again to show a glee
club giving their all to the chorus of
Steven's number.
"And look at that revolving stage,"
Thorne rhapsodized. "It's a work of
genius. It's making the show the
smoothest thing on wheels — and
listen to the mike, it's perfect! And
the recording systlem, why I'm hav
ing my numbers recorded, even."
The fact that Thome's numbers
are pantomimes, with the assistance
of Bobbe Harris, on Stanford tradi
tions isn't bothering the ancient edi
tor. He claims he will be able to
hear his audience reaction, literally,
for the first time.
' "The Gaieties are really a Stan
j ford show this year," Thorne as-
I serted. "There's none of that imi
] tation Hollywood stuff, it's not built
|on splendor but on humor. The
show is accenting the Big Game
week-end, you might call it a dra
matic review of the week-end."
The curtain came down on the
glee club, and Stevens, and the
stage manager dashed up, berating
Thorne for not giving him a list of
his props. The Chappie's man of all
work started off for stage center.
"Hey," he yelled back, "don't for
get to say the finale—that's the big
mystery number—is the best thing
in the show. Muheim wrote it, the
whole cast is in it, and it's terrific!"
