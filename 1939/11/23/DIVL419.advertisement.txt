Yoird be surprised how telephone
engineers put tliem lo work for you
How to put more and more wires into a telephone cable
without increasing its diameter is an cver present problem
at Western Kleetric— manufacturing unit of llie Hell
System. Kxisting duets beneath eity streets limit l»olh the
number ami llie diameter of cables — but demand for tele
phone service continues to grow.
Until reecnllv, llie largest cable contained 3036 wires
j 7 n
in a diameter of 2~:'a inches. ears of study led to an en
tirely new insulating process that saved 3/1000 ol an inch
per wire. Multiply this tiny fraction of an inch by 3030,
and you provide enough space to place 606 more w ires
in llie same size cable! — a total of 4212.
\\ itli such resourcefulness, Bell S\ stem engineers meet
countless problems, iicsult: )ou can talk to almo-l any
one, anywhere—quickly, at low cost.
