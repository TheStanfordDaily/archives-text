### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
\ MERICAN-JAPANESE bad feel
ing has been pyramiding so
steadily that, if there's no turn for
the better by the first of the year,
the United States may impose eco
nomic sanctions against the Nip
ponese.
At any rate, this was the sub
stance of what Sumner Welles, Cor
dell Hull's right-hand man, indicated
yesterday. The existing trade pact
between the two powers expires on
Jan. 26, 1940. And the United
States Rave notice last July of a
desire to cancel its provisions. This
action was a reprimand for a num
ber of incidents involving American
citizens and interests which have
occurred in China since the Japa
nese invasion began. Those inci
dents didn't cease last July. In
stead, within the last month at least,
Japan has continued to insult
American nationals and to impede
the flow of goods to the U. S. con
cession zone in Tientsin.

And all of this interference and
harrassment of American commerce
and nationals in China is very dis
tasteful indeed to Sumner Welles.
He said so, pointedly, a few days
ago. Yesterday he reiterated his
earlier stand.
* >!« &
Expiration of the treaty between
the two countries will leave
America free to impose embar
goes, discriminatory tariffs and
other economic reprisals against
Japan. There has been consider
able agitation in Congress for in
voking economic sanctions against
the Japanese, but no responsible
Administration official has been
rash enough to admit that such a
step is an immediate prospect.

JJUNDREDS of millions of dol
lars are involved in the dispute.
Japan is this country's third best
customer. And she doesn't deal in
chicken feed. In 1938 she bought
$239,575,000 worth of American
goods and products. On the other
hand, American imports from Japan
totaled only $126,820,000. Silk, quite
naturally, was the greatest item of
import from Japan.
Americans hold over a hundred
million dollars worth of Japanese
bonds, which ultimately would be
hard hit in the event of a com
plete trade rupture, and United
States citizens wholly own or
have substantial interests in Japa
nese enterprises valued at an
other $46,700,000.
Welles went to unusual lengths
yesterday to blast reports here and
in Tokyo to the effect that repre
sentatives of the two powers are
active in seeking to prevent, a rup
ture of trade relations. Nothing of
the kind, he said. Usually he doesn't
permit himself to be quoted directly.
K* * alt
r ESTERDAY he did. Reading
from a prepared memorandum,
he said Ambassador Joseph Grew in
Tokyo is and has been for many
years in constant communication
with the Japanese foreign office. But
a stiffening of this government's at
titude toward Japan became notice
able early this year after that coun
try had ignored a formal note of
Hull's outlining in detail our com
plaints against Japanese military
acts in China and demanding as
surance that the situation would be
remedied. That situation was not
remedied—at least not to our gov
ernment's satisfaction.

Another potential trade problem
interested Welles today. lie said
he was making inquiries into the
reported new Argentina trade
policy under which that country's
importers would make most of its
purchases from Great Britain and
France, and avoid unnecessary
purchases from other countries.
That would mean a definite Al
lied foothold in the western hem
isphere—the advantages of which
arc debatable.
Senator King of Utah seemed to
keynote governmental opinion when
he said he would rather see the Al
lies obtain an economic advan
tage in Argentina than Germany.
