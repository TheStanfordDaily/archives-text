# Ex-Stanford Man Operates $5,000,000 Cement Plant
## 
### RICHARD DUDMAN 
Ever hear of the Permanente canyon cement plant It's colossal.
Situated 12 miles southwest of Stanford, just past Los Altos, the plant
will tap a limestone deposit large enough to last 10 centuries—-until 2939
A.I). The two-year job of construction is being jammed into six months,
and 900 builders are working 24 hours a day rushing tho job toward

.completion.
Colossal also is the story of how a
Stanford graduate became head of
what will l>e a $5,000,000 plant.
The graduate is Henry Kaiser, Jr.,
'39, son of Henry Kaiser of Boulder
Dam fame. When Henry Jr., D.U.
and manager of the 1938 football
leam, was finished with his studies
at the end of fall quarter of last
year, father and son carried on a
conversation that must have -gone
something like this:
PLANT NEAR FARM
Kaiser, pere: "Hank, you are
growing up and now you arc ready
to leave the Stanford Farm to take
your place in the business world."
Kaiser, fils: "Yes, Father."
K., pere: "You've enjoyed your
self a lot at Stanford, and it. so hap
pens that you can stay right near
there. Just 12 miles from the Farm
there is a big deposit, of limestone
with a certain kind of clay close by
—the two chief ingredients for the
cement I use in my construction
jobs.
$5,000,000 PLANT
"I'm going to build you a $5,-
000.000 cement plant there and put
you in charge."
K., fils: "Okay, Dad. When do we
start?"
Roughly, that is the way it was,
and they started immediately. The
way the infant Permanente Corpo
ration started out, success was prac
tically a sure thing. Going alter the
cement contract for the mammoth
Shasta Dam, Permanente undercut
by a large margin the combine of
five or six other companies that put
in the other bid for the job.
Careful planning enabled the
company to figure such a low pro
duction cost. An elaborate materials
handling system was outlined, mak
ing it unnecessary for human hands
to touch the limestone or finished
cement from the time it. is quarried
until storage cars are run off onto
the siding at Redding for use in
the Shasta Dam.
Construction of the plant started
June 15, and kilns, silos, processing
tanks, and conveyor belts began to
take shape at the mouth of Perma
nente canyon. Actual production of
cement is expected to start just
after the first of the year.
Although the quarry is at the top
of a 1800-foot hill over a mile from
the plant, the problem of transport
ing the limestone from quarry to
plant has been solved satisfactorily
by construction of a conveyor belt
stretching the whole distance. This
actually is a series of three endless
rubber belts that carry the crushed
rock down the hillside, one belt,
dumping the rock onto the next
when it is necessary to turn a
corner.
MOVED BY GRAVITY
Since the conveyor is on an in
cline, the weight of the rock is suf
ficent to keep the belt moving at a
rate of four or' five miles an hour,
without any outside power—only
small electric motors to control the
rate of speed.
Modern methods were applied
also to construction of the 275-foot
stack leading from the kilns and the
27 concrete silos capable of holding

700,000 barrels of finished cement.
Forms for big jobs like these are
very expensive and take a long
time to build, so the construction of
both was handled by a subcontrac
tor who specializes in such jobs.
Moving forms were used, being
moved upward an inch every 10
minutes as the concrete set and
more was poured. A Wooden form
could be used for the silos, but in
pouring the stack it was found nec
essary to use a metal form that could
be "taken up" as it progressed up
ward, since the stack tapers.
DUSTINESS GAS
Another place where modern
methods play an important part is in
removing dust from the flue gas
that will pass out of the big stack.
There was a little unpleasantness
for a while when residents of the
vicinity heard a cement plant was
to be built. They didn't want the at
mosphere clouded by dust.
But Perrnanente's plans already
included provision for construction
of a "Cottrell Precipitator"—a pat
ented device that removes dust by
ionization of the particles. Dust in
the stream of hot air from the kilns
is charged negatively as it passes
through a chamber filled with metal
rods which are charged positively.
Unlike signs attract, and collection of
*>00 tons of dust a day will be the
result. Since this dust is only ce
ment that failed to dry into chunks
or "clinkers," it can be moistened
again and passed through the kilns
a second time.
Outsiders cannot drive into the
area during the week, but Sunday is
visitors' day, and crowds come from
10 to fi o'clock to hear explanations
by experienced guides.

and 900 builders are working 24 hours a day rushing tho job toward

.completion.
Colossal also is the story of how a
Stanford graduate became head of
what will l>e a $5,000,000 plant.
The graduate is Henry Kaiser, Jr.,
'39, son of Henry Kaiser of Boulder
Dam fame. When Henry Jr., D.U.
and manager of the 1938 football
leam, was finished with his studies
at the end of fall quarter of last
year, father and son carried on a
conversation that must have -gone
something like this:
PLANT NEAR FARM
Kaiser, pere: "Hank, you are
growing up and now you arc ready
to leave the Stanford Farm to take
your place in the business world."
Kaiser, fils: "Yes, Father."
K., pere: "You've enjoyed your
self a lot at Stanford, and it. so hap
pens that you can stay right near
there. Just 12 miles from the Farm
there is a big deposit, of limestone
with a certain kind of clay close by
—the two chief ingredients for the
cement I use in my construction
jobs.
$5,000,000 PLANT
"I'm going to build you a $5,-
000.000 cement plant there and put
you in charge."
K., fils: "Okay, Dad. When do we
start?"
Roughly, that is the way it was,
and they started immediately. The
way the infant Permanente Corpo
ration started out, success was prac
tically a sure thing. Going alter the
cement contract for the mammoth
Shasta Dam, Permanente undercut
by a large margin the combine of
five or six other companies that put
in the other bid for the job.
Careful planning enabled the
company to figure such a low pro
duction cost. An elaborate materials
handling system was outlined, mak
ing it unnecessary for human hands
to touch the limestone or finished
cement from the time it. is quarried
until storage cars are run off onto
the siding at Redding for use in
the Shasta Dam.
Construction of the plant started
June 15, and kilns, silos, processing
tanks, and conveyor belts began to
take shape at the mouth of Perma
nente canyon. Actual production of
cement is expected to start just
after the first of the year.
Although the quarry is at the top
of a 1800-foot hill over a mile from
the plant, the problem of transport
ing the limestone from quarry to
plant has been solved satisfactorily
by construction of a conveyor belt
stretching the whole distance. This
actually is a series of three endless
rubber belts that carry the crushed
rock down the hillside, one belt,
dumping the rock onto the next
when it is necessary to turn a
corner.
MOVED BY GRAVITY
Since the conveyor is on an in
cline, the weight of the rock is suf
ficent to keep the belt moving at a
rate of four or' five miles an hour,
without any outside power—only
small electric motors to control the
rate of speed.
Modern methods were applied
also to construction of the 275-foot
stack leading from the kilns and the
27 concrete silos capable of holding

700,000 barrels of finished cement.
Forms for big jobs like these are
very expensive and take a long
time to build, so the construction of
both was handled by a subcontrac
tor who specializes in such jobs.
Moving forms were used, being
moved upward an inch every 10
minutes as the concrete set and
more was poured. A Wooden form
could be used for the silos, but in
pouring the stack it was found nec
essary to use a metal form that could
be "taken up" as it progressed up
ward, since the stack tapers.
DUSTINESS GAS
Another place where modern
methods play an important part is in
removing dust from the flue gas
that will pass out of the big stack.
There was a little unpleasantness
for a while when residents of the
vicinity heard a cement plant was
to be built. They didn't want the at
mosphere clouded by dust.
But Perrnanente's plans already
included provision for construction
of a "Cottrell Precipitator"—a pat
ented device that removes dust by
ionization of the particles. Dust in
the stream of hot air from the kilns
is charged negatively as it passes
through a chamber filled with metal
rods which are charged positively.
Unlike signs attract, and collection of
*>00 tons of dust a day will be the
result. Since this dust is only ce
ment that failed to dry into chunks
or "clinkers," it can be moistened
again and passed through the kilns
a second time.
Outsiders cannot drive into the
area during the week, but Sunday is
visitors' day, and crowds come from
10 to fi o'clock to hear explanations
by experienced guides.

Seven municipal jobs are held by
Emil Abel of Beedsville, Wis.
Ever hear of the Permanente canyon cement plant It's colossal.
Situated 12 miles southwest of Stanford, just past Los Altos, the plant
will tap a limestone deposit large enough to last 10 centuries—-until 2939
A.I). The two-year job of construction is being jammed into six months,

The graduate is Henry Kaiser, Jr.,
'39, son of Henry Kaiser of Boulder
Dam fame. When Henry Jr., D.U.
and manager of the 1938 football
leam, was finished with his studies
at the end of fall quarter of last
year, father and son carried on a
conversation that must have -gone
something like this:
PLANT NEAR FARM
Kaiser, pere: "Hank, you are
growing up and now you arc ready
to leave the Stanford Farm to take
your place in the business world."
Kaiser, fils: "Yes, Father."
K., pere: "You've enjoyed your
self a lot at Stanford, and it. so hap
pens that you can stay right near
there. Just 12 miles from the Farm
there is a big deposit, of limestone
with a certain kind of clay close by
—the two chief ingredients for the
cement I use in my construction
jobs.
$5,000,000 PLANT
"I'm going to build you a $5,-
000.000 cement plant there and put
you in charge."
K., fils: "Okay, Dad. When do we
start?"
Roughly, that is the way it was,
and they started immediately. The
way the infant Permanente Corpo
ration started out, success was prac
tically a sure thing. Going alter the
cement contract for the mammoth
Shasta Dam, Permanente undercut
by a large margin the combine of
five or six other companies that put
in the other bid for the job.
Careful planning enabled the
company to figure such a low pro
duction cost. An elaborate materials
handling system was outlined, mak
ing it unnecessary for human hands
to touch the limestone or finished
cement from the time it. is quarried
until storage cars are run off onto
the siding at Redding for use in
the Shasta Dam.
Construction of the plant started
June 15, and kilns, silos, processing
tanks, and conveyor belts began to
take shape at the mouth of Perma
nente canyon. Actual production of
cement is expected to start just
after the first of the year.
Although the quarry is at the top
of a 1800-foot hill over a mile from
the plant, the problem of transport
ing the limestone from quarry to
plant has been solved satisfactorily
by construction of a conveyor belt
stretching the whole distance. This
actually is a series of three endless
rubber belts that carry the crushed
rock down the hillside, one belt,
dumping the rock onto the next
when it is necessary to turn a
corner.
MOVED BY GRAVITY
Since the conveyor is on an in
cline, the weight of the rock is suf
ficent to keep the belt moving at a
rate of four or' five miles an hour,
without any outside power—only
small electric motors to control the
rate of speed.
Modern methods were applied
also to construction of the 275-foot
stack leading from the kilns and the
27 concrete silos capable of holding

700,000 barrels of finished cement.
Forms for big jobs like these are
very expensive and take a long
time to build, so the construction of
both was handled by a subcontrac
tor who specializes in such jobs.
Moving forms were used, being
moved upward an inch every 10
minutes as the concrete set and
more was poured. A Wooden form
could be used for the silos, but in
pouring the stack it was found nec
essary to use a metal form that could
be "taken up" as it progressed up
ward, since the stack tapers.
DUSTINESS GAS
Another place where modern
methods play an important part is in
removing dust from the flue gas
that will pass out of the big stack.
There was a little unpleasantness
for a while when residents of the
vicinity heard a cement plant was
to be built. They didn't want the at
mosphere clouded by dust.
But Perrnanente's plans already
included provision for construction
of a "Cottrell Precipitator"—a pat
ented device that removes dust by
ionization of the particles. Dust in
the stream of hot air from the kilns
is charged negatively as it passes
through a chamber filled with metal
rods which are charged positively.
Unlike signs attract, and collection of
*>00 tons of dust a day will be the
result. Since this dust is only ce
ment that failed to dry into chunks
or "clinkers," it can be moistened
again and passed through the kilns
a second time.
Outsiders cannot drive into the
area during the week, but Sunday is
visitors' day, and crowds come from
10 to fi o'clock to hear explanations
by experienced guides.

Seven municipal jobs are held by
Emil Abel of Beedsville, Wis.
Ever hear of the Permanente canyon cement plant It's colossal.
Situated 12 miles southwest of Stanford, just past Los Altos, the plant
will tap a limestone deposit large enough to last 10 centuries—-until 2939
A.I). The two-year job of construction is being jammed into six months,
and 900 builders are working 24 hours a day rushing tho job toward

.completion.
Colossal also is the story of how a
Stanford graduate became head of
what will l>e a $5,000,000 plant.
