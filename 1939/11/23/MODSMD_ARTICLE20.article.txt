# Pyre to Burn At 9 on Toyon-Branner Field
## 
### 
Once again the California Bear will
burn atop a towering pyre of oil
soaked wood.
Once again Stanford will rally
'round the leaping flames, flames
which for numberless years have in
stilled a spirit, a desire, a some
thing indefinable which nothing else
can replace.
To the field behind Branner and
Toyon halls instead of the traditional
dry bed of Lake Lagunita, Stanford
ites and spectators from miles around
will trek tonight at about 9 o'clock,
immediately after the rally, to wit
ness the annual touching off of the
huge blaze, amid a barrage of color
ful and ear-splitting fireworks.
At the crack of dawn this morning,
empty trucks laden with ambitious
frosh set out from the Bonfire site in
the day-long search for enough wood
to fill the gaping maw created by the
gaunt telephone pole framework.
WOOD TO BE CHECKED
Under the chairmanship of Cardi
nals' Dick Frank and Bill McCurdy
an efficient system of committees
has been set up to supervise the
frosh in their building of the fire.
In addition to the change of loca
tion from Lake Lagunita to the
Branner fields, the only difference
between this year's blaze and that,
of years past will be the strict check
ing of all wood used and the fact
that work did not get under way
until 6 o'clock this morning instead
of progressing throughout the entire
night.
However, Bob Breckner and his
committee on trucking and wood
scouting have made arrangements
for good supplies of combustibles
which will be picked up during the
day, by the 15 hoicks loaned by
local merchants.
CAL RAZES FIREWOOD
Of the repeated attempts of alleged
Cal raiders to bum material stored
for the Bonfire, one has been suc
cessful. A good supply of wooden
boxes and tree trimmings was razed
about 12:03 yesterday morning;
some material was saved and the
fire department quelled the prema
ture minor blaze. No other campus
damage was reported from the raid.
Because of the absence of the
Boathouse platforms for the yell
leaders, platforms are being erected
so that they will be able to get
above the crowd and lead the usual
songs and yells.
The large array of firework spe
cialties has been donated by Walt
Heinccke, local Shell Oil dealer.
Other Palo Alto merchants have
made various donations of food
which will be served to Bonfire
workers only, by a committee c»l"
Roble and upperclass serving women
headed by Betty Moses.

frosh in their building of the fire.
In addition to the change of loca
tion from Lake Lagunita to the
Branner fields, the only difference
between this year's blaze and that,
of years past will be the strict check
ing of all wood used and the fact
that work did not get under way
until 6 o'clock this morning instead
of progressing throughout the entire
night.
However, Bob Breckner and his
committee on trucking and wood
scouting have made arrangements
for good supplies of combustibles
which will be picked up during the
day, by the 15 hoicks loaned by
local merchants.
CAL RAZES FIREWOOD
Of the repeated attempts of alleged
Cal raiders to bum material stored
for the Bonfire, one has been suc
cessful. A good supply of wooden
boxes and tree trimmings was razed
about 12:03 yesterday morning;
some material was saved and the
fire department quelled the prema
ture minor blaze. No other campus
damage was reported from the raid.
Because of the absence of the
Boathouse platforms for the yell
leaders, platforms are being erected
so that they will be able to get
above the crowd and lead the usual
songs and yells.
The large array of firework spe
cialties has been donated by Walt
Heinccke, local Shell Oil dealer.
Other Palo Alto merchants have
made various donations of food
which will be served to Bonfire
workers only, by a committee c»l"
Roble and upperclass serving women
headed by Betty Moses.

Because of the last-minute inabil- |
ity of the Pacific Gas and Electric 1
Company, who have donated the i
poles for the framework of the Bon- |
fire, to set these poles in the ground, J
a crew of students yesterday were
forced to undertake this task them
selves so that the poles would be
set by this morning in time for ac
tual construction to get under way.
STUDENTS SET POLES
After receiving a bid of $90 from
the Corporation Yard to do the job,
the' student crew, led by A.S.S.U.
President Ken Cuthbertson and
composed of several freshmen and
members of the Bonfire Committee,
set to work yesterday afternoon and
after four and a half hours of hard
digging had the poles mounted in
position to receive the tons of wood
which will fill it this morning.
Committee Chairmen Bill Mc-
Curdy and Dick Frank, who helped
with the work, stated that a port
able crane loaned by the Palo Alto
city hall aided in raising the poles
into place.
Supervision of construction today
will be handled by Co-chuirmen
Jack Alltucker and John Moore.
lIORABIN'S GIVES OIL
Horabin's Oil and Burner Com
pany will, following its yearly tra
dition, donate the 500 gallons of oil |
which will be sprayed on the pyre !
late this afternoon after the con
struction has been completed.
Regulation of parking will be j
handled by campus police, who re- j
quest that no cars be driven or [
parked on the polo field, or at any j
other place close to the fire.
Once again the California Bear will
burn atop a towering pyre of oil
soaked wood.
Once again Stanford will rally
'round the leaping flames, flames
which for numberless years have in
stilled a spirit, a desire, a some
thing indefinable which nothing else
can replace.
To the field behind Branner and
Toyon halls instead of the traditional
dry bed of Lake Lagunita, Stanford
ites and spectators from miles around
will trek tonight at about 9 o'clock,
immediately after the rally, to wit
ness the annual touching off of the
huge blaze, amid a barrage of color
ful and ear-splitting fireworks.
At the crack of dawn this morning,
empty trucks laden with ambitious
frosh set out from the Bonfire site in
the day-long search for enough wood
to fill the gaping maw created by the
gaunt telephone pole framework.

leaders, platforms are being erected
so that they will be able to get
above the crowd and lead the usual
songs and yells.
The large array of firework spe
cialties has been donated by Walt

Roble and upperclass serving women

Because of the last-minute inabil- |
ity of the Pacific Gas and Electric 1
Company, who have donated the i
poles for the framework of the Bon- |
fire, to set these poles in the ground, J
a crew of students yesterday were
forced to undertake this task them
selves so that the poles would be
set by this morning in time for ac
tual construction to get under way.
STUDENTS SET POLES
After receiving a bid of $90 from
the Corporation Yard to do the job,
the' student crew, led by A.S.S.U.
President Ken Cuthbertson and
composed of several freshmen and
members of the Bonfire Committee,
set to work yesterday afternoon and
after four and a half hours of hard
digging had the poles mounted in
position to receive the tons of wood
which will fill it this morning.
Committee Chairmen Bill Mc-
Curdy and Dick Frank, who helped
with the work, stated that a port
able crane loaned by the Palo Alto
city hall aided in raising the poles
into place.
Supervision of construction today
will be handled by Co-chuirmen
Jack Alltucker and John Moore.
lIORABIN'S GIVES OIL
Horabin's Oil and Burner Com
pany will, following its yearly tra
dition, donate the 500 gallons of oil |
which will be sprayed on the pyre !
late this afternoon after the con
struction has been completed.
Regulation of parking will be j
handled by campus police, who re- j
quest that no cars be driven or [
parked on the polo field, or at any j
other place close to the fire.
Once again the California Bear will
burn atop a towering pyre of oil
soaked wood.
Once again Stanford will rally
'round the leaping flames, flames
which for numberless years have in
stilled a spirit, a desire, a some
thing indefinable which nothing else
can replace.
To the field behind Branner and
Toyon halls instead of the traditional
dry bed of Lake Lagunita, Stanford
ites and spectators from miles around
will trek tonight at about 9 o'clock,
immediately after the rally, to wit
ness the annual touching off of the
huge blaze, amid a barrage of color
ful and ear-splitting fireworks.
At the crack of dawn this morning,
empty trucks laden with ambitious
frosh set out from the Bonfire site in
the day-long search for enough wood
to fill the gaping maw created by the
gaunt telephone pole framework.
WOOD TO BE CHECKED
Under the chairmanship of Cardi
nals' Dick Frank and Bill McCurdy
an efficient system of committees
has been set up to supervise the
frosh in their building of the fire.
In addition to the change of loca
tion from Lake Lagunita to the
Branner fields, the only difference
between this year's blaze and that,
of years past will be the strict check
ing of all wood used and the fact
that work did not get under way
until 6 o'clock this morning instead
of progressing throughout the entire
night.
However, Bob Breckner and his
committee on trucking and wood
scouting have made arrangements
for good supplies of combustibles
which will be picked up during the
day, by the 15 hoicks loaned by
local merchants.
CAL RAZES FIREWOOD
Of the repeated attempts of alleged
Cal raiders to bum material stored
for the Bonfire, one has been suc
cessful. A good supply of wooden
boxes and tree trimmings was razed
about 12:03 yesterday morning;
some material was saved and the
fire department quelled the prema
ture minor blaze. No other campus
damage was reported from the raid.
