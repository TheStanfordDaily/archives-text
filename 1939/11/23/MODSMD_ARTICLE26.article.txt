# Thanksgiving Day Just 'Plain Old Thursday' At Stanford
## 
### JEFF LITTLEBOY 
Today is Thursday, November 2:s—Thanksgiving to most of the rest of
the U.S., hut just plain old Thursday to Stanfordites. Papers are due, class
bells will jangle, and all other traditions will be observed, we hope, but,
throughout the length and breadth of many of our United States, people*
will eat too much turkey and fall back exhausted among the scattered
sections of the morning paper.
Stilled will be the clatter of the Hoover Li he's riveting guns, the cheer
ful screech of its donkey engine, while the brawny gentlemen who daily)

.defy death upon its spidery girders
take an extra day of rest. Will that
situation crowd the library with ear
nest scholars, taking advantage of
tho cloisterly quiet of a legal holi
day? No one knows.
But some of the holiday spirit has
sneaked down Palm Drive and
spread its pleasant glow over the
campus. The frosh and the eating
clubs fed by Encina Commons will
get a full turkey dinner with fixin's
tonight, as will many of the frater
nity and sorority houses. And local
turkeys not laid low by today's on
slaught will get it in the neck again
next week, when Encina will dish
up for the Republican Thanksgiving.
So count your change carefully,
kiddies, for the banks are closed,
and don't meet the wrong train or
bus, for holiday schedules are in
force. The Democrats' challenge of
two turkeys in every pot has left us
mildly amused but secure at the top
of our ivory tower.

SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 22 (UP).
— Hans Linne, 76, internationally
known composer and orchestra con
ductor, died today after a brief
illness.
