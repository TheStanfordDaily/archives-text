Stanford rooters will sit on the
east side of the stadium Saturday
at the Big Game, giving up their
usual shady section in favor of the
visiting C'al students. This will be
the first time this season that Card
rooters have occupied the side
nearest the highway, and the sec
ond time in Big Game history.
