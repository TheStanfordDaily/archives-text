If that is true then perhaps it's
Stanford's turn to inaugurate a
three-year cycle of victories in Big
Game competition. For California
has won the last three classics, after
the Cards annexed victories from
1933 through '35.
This latest victory cycle business
started 'way back in 1924, just after
Stanford's thrilling rally that j
brought the Indians from the short
end of a 20-6 score with ten minutes :
to play to a 20-10 tie.
"Pop" Warner said right after the
game that the 1924 contest would be
the closest Cal would come to vic

j a game until 1931, with one tie game j
j breaking the monotonous string of 1
1 Card victories.
When the Vow Boys entered the
j scene for Stanford, 7-3, 9-7, and j
j 13-0 wins followed in '33, '34, and |
