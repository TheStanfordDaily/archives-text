Just like a story-book finish, Stanford water poloists got back on the

thrilling fashion.
Fred Manwaring started as a sub- I

two of the local's goals. Then Not- j

scored two more. Bill Bleecker j
handled a score, and then there was '
Plate's thrilling last second effort.
California opened the game with a i
goal and Stanford's Manwaring came j
back to tie it. California kept the
see-saw going with another, but i
Bleecker scored after a nice break j
the length of the pool by Dick Hoo- 1

Stanford went into a 3 to 2 lead j
with the start of the second half !
when Manwaring countered again. \
But California tied the score. Then
Nottage replaced Manwaring and
immediately scored. But again the
Bears came back. But Nottage was
hot and tipped a sensational shot in
the net on a pass from Patty. And
once again the Golden seven knot
ted it.
But Plate's shot felt the net with
the sounding of the gun and the
game at last was Stanford's
