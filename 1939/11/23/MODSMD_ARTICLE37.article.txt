# Intrasquad Meet to Offer Preview of Track Strength
## 
### 
One of the most interesting angles to the big intrasquad meet between
the Red-; and the Greens, Dec. (>, will be the comparison of the marks
recorded by participants against those chalked up by the Cal squad in a
similar meet at Berkeley two weeks ago.
Despite the fact that these are oIV-season performances, the compari-

son should shed some light on the,
1940 Big Meet. Cal won the classic
last spring, 74-50.

nalism to sandwich boards, the Hods
and the Greens have been showing
a lot of spirit during this past week
and both outfits are looking forward
to their first real competition this
year. Mushy Girard and Craig
Williamson, Green and Red captains,
respectively, haven't been on speak
ing terms for two weeks. Clyde
Jeffrey, ace sprinter, is not compet
ing in the meet.
Williamson and Girard accounted
for the best times turned in yester
day, with marks of 49 seconds flat
for the quarter and 1:54,3 for the
half, respectively. Ernie Clark also
turned in a 39-second 253-yard
dash.

One of the most interesting angles to the big intrasquad meet between
the Red-; and the Greens, Dec. (>, will be the comparison of the marks
recorded by participants against those chalked up by the Cal squad in a
similar meet at Berkeley two weeks ago.
Despite the fact that these are oIV-season performances, the compari-

son should shed some light on the,
1940 Big Meet. Cal won the classic
last spring, 74-50.
With everything from yellow jour
nalism to sandwich boards, the Hods
and the Greens have been showing
a lot of spirit during this past week
and both outfits are looking forward
to their first real competition this
year. Mushy Girard and Craig
Williamson, Green and Red captains,
respectively, haven't been on speak
ing terms for two weeks. Clyde
Jeffrey, ace sprinter, is not compet
ing in the meet.
Williamson and Girard accounted
for the best times turned in yester
day, with marks of 49 seconds flat
for the quarter and 1:54,3 for the
half, respectively. Ernie Clark also
turned in a 39-second 253-yard
dash.
The event will be scored on a
5-3-2-1 basis. The personnel of the
two teams is as follows:
RFDS: Williamson (cap.), Grant,
Guthrie, Alexander, Irwin, Doud,
Hitt, Wool, Smith, Arnold, J. Moore,
