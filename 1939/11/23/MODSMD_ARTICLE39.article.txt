# Intramural Cups May Be Cancelled
## 
### 
A possibility that intramural
sports teams may no longer be
awarded cups and trophies for their
achievements was foreseen yester
day by Harry Wolter, baseball
coach and Stanford's intramural di
rector.
"When organizations or individu
als get a kick out of taking trophies
rightfully won and possessed by
other groups, .steps must be takeu
to stop them," he said yesterday, : ,n
regard to the disappearance of sev
eral all-year cups on the campus in
recent months.
"While these cups have a high
original cost, their resale value is
practically nothing; so it looks like
someone with a dull sense of "humor
is spoiling the entire basis of our
award system," Wolter continued.
