//"P) ALLIES, parades, bonfires?"
11 "Where am I sending my boy—to a
country club?"
No, mister, this is no tour-year summer re
sort. But it isn't an academic monastery either.
Your boy goes to a school where they rea
lize that the most learned man in the world is
not the happiest, most successful man—where
they understand the supreme importance of
making the student a useful, well-adjusted so
cial being.
Stanford recognizes the fact that bonfires,
parades, and rallies have their place in the
complete undergraduate curriculum.
The building of the Big Game bonfire will
glue the freshman class together in a unit
which will remain unbroken throughout the
next four years. This day of sweat and dust
and dirty jeans will stick in the mind of every
frosh as long as he remembers Stanford.
For the rest of the campus the torchlight
parade with blaring band music and floats
crawling down the Row, the uninhibited enthu
siasm of the rally, and the spectacle of the
blazing bonfire are the vital elements of Big
Game week.
The cynic may sneer at such festivities, but
he is just as misguided as the man who believes
that college should run between mud-fights
and jolly-ups.
The ideal that the University is seeking is
the middle road, the production of the well
rounded Stanford man.
When freshmen sweat all day piling lum
ber on the pyre, when sophomores drive floats
down the Row, when juniors and seniors shout
and cheer tonight, Stanford is not neglecting
their education.
It is teaching them how to live.
