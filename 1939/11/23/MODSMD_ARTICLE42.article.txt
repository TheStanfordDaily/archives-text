# Staying Home, Eh?
## 
### 
SEVENTY-FIVE thousand people had yelled
themselves hoarse, but he hadn't heard
them. Seventy-five thousand people had
watched a football team clad in red and silver
fight for 60 minutes against a team dressed in
blue and gold, but for him there were but
22 men in the Stanford Stadium.
He had gone to yell for a football team and
see a football game, and what a game he had
seen.
But now the game was over. For the first
time he became clearly aware of the 75,000
who had come with him to the Stadium. They
swarmed out the entrances and down the stairs,
and he was with them, crowding into narrow
exits and spreading out on the field where the
cars were parked.
And walking out with them, listening to
them talk about the game and the crowd, he
heard someone ask the persons with him,
"Where are you going tonight?"
And he heard the answer.
When he got back to his fraternity (hall,
room in Palo Alto) his room-mate was already
there and ready to take a shower. He asked
him where he was going, and he thought of
the places he himself could go.
Well, he could go to the City. He could go
to a hotel and dance. Yes, he could qo there

and dance if all of Cal and the Stanford and
California alumni weren't going to be there.
No, that was out.
There was Del Monte. But that took a car.
To say nothing of the dough. Oh hell, he had
the money, but all that trouble —it wasn't worth
it. And where could he get a car?
There were other places around the Penin
sula. Sure. Nice and quiet. And dull.
Well, where could he go? Just one place.
The same place he had heard the people at
the game say they were going. The same
place his room-mate was going: to the Big
Game dance at the Millbrae Country Club.
Yes, that was the place to go—if he had a
date. But it was Saturday night. He didn't have
a date. He just hadn't called anyone, that was
all. He didn't know he would want to go out,
he didn't know until he left the Stadium after
that football game, and realized that every
one else was going out.
And now he didn't have a date.
But this is not your story. It is not a sketch
from your biography. Because right now it is
Thursday morning, not Saturday afternoon.
