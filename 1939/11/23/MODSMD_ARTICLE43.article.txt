### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
WITH SOUND AM) EVERYTHING
STANFORD has a lot of straight stufT in a school
year, enough seriousness to satisfy the tragic
spirits who will become our pillars of society. But an
essential of balanced living is a group of people who
can laugh at themselves. The maintenance of stand
ards depends upon constructive beliefs, but the pres
ervation of sanity calls for comics.
And the Farm, thank God, has its nothing-sacred
sect. Along with our ever-serious stalwarts, we still
have the Big Game Gaieties.
Tragedies may come, and Women's Council may go,
but the Gaieties still think we are funny. We can
lose football games; Dick Hyland can disown us; a
monster of steel can lour down at us where green
fields used to be; Cal men can shave the heads of our
freshmen; roughs may challenge the right of Stanford
women to be exclusive; and Hortense may persecute
the fourth page of The Daily. But Stanford spirit is
not dead so long as we can laugh with the Gaieties.

|N KEEPING with tradition this year's entertainers
have noticed the ridiculous sides of Farm life.
They have even noticed the satire in their own posi
tion, an observation which has often been as obvious
as ignored. There is one skit on writing a skit, for the
Big Game Gaieties. That is the acme of self-directed
laughter. The chap who can't laugh at himself will
probably grow up telling little children there is no
Santa Claus, swearing at his wife, chewing celery in
people's ears, and marrying one of the Daughters of
the American Revolution.
There has, however, been one serious objection
raised to Gaieties numbers in the past. Nothing much,
.just that you couldn't hear them. Pantomime is very
good in its place, of course, but a skit in which the
actors are attempting to talk is not one of those places.
But this year's Gaieties director has a scathing cam
pus opinion in this morning's Daily which spikes the
false rumor that tomorrow's show will not be a talkie.
Probably originating with California supporters or
Earl Browder, the accusation that Memorial Hall's
sound equipment will go dead in time to spoil the gag
lines is absolutely false.
It is to be hoped that this subversive sabotaging
will be one of the ridiculed subjects in the show. Cal
may have the Axe, and they may steal the Axe yell,
but Stanford still has its microphones.
So hail to the Gaieties! As usual, they will be funny,
and this time they will be heard!
