Dear Larry: It seems that once again wc are con
fronted with that annual bogey-man, the public ad
dress system of the Big Game Gaieties. I agree, as
who wouldn't, that the speaker system thus far has
not been satisfactory. However, my reason for writ
ing is to defend Ram's Head and the Gaieties against
your inference that we .sit. up nights plotting ways for
the P.A. to go dead for our own shows.
First of all, Memorial Hall is not equipped with the
finest type of sound equipment. Secondly, Memorial
Hall is not by any means acoustically perfect. During
last year's Gaieties, the P.A. went dead. That isn't our
fault or the fault of the equipment. That, might happen
at any time. Complete breakdowns will occur. What
wc are working for is better amplification as a whole
with the "perfect equipment" of which you speak.
♦ * * *
'Y'OU SAY that only once has the system gone dead
during a Tuesday Evening lecture. That makes the
Gaieties and the Tuesday Evening Lecture Series even
up on breakdowns. It's true, the other times you
could hear the speaker, but. you couldn't have heard
him any better than you'd hear us if he had been
singing instead of speaking, and had been accompanied
by a 16-piece band.
Therefore, the true test of that P.A. is how it works
in our shows. There it h;is to meet its greatest test,
and so far it hasn't passed too high. Therefore, we
have to experiment, and that we have been doing. I
think we improved in the Spring Show last year. This
year we have a new idea that, after preliminary tests,
promises highly satisfactory results.
So, to sum up, we are doing the very best wo can
with the equipment provided. It is good equipment
for lectures, but it needs adaptation for musical shows.
We've been making good progress in our experiments,
and at risk of repeating myself, Larry, you ought to
be able to hear the Gaieties this year unless you forget
to remove those ear-muffs.
I hope wc blast, you out of that four-bit scat.
Sincerely,
Charlie Bulotti

Every week Fred Waring plays college songs on
his radio program; last night ho asked for suggestions.
Stanford's "Stanford in Spring" would be beautifully
done by his glee club.
I believe it is one of the Ix'st songs Stanford has,
neglected as it is. and I am sure Waring will have his
glee club sing it if enough letters arc written request
ing it. Twenty-live letters will do it, and the first has
already been sent. 11 is worth writing for

wc are working for is better amplification as a whole
with the "perfect equipment" of which you speak.

'Y'OU SAY that only once has the system gone dead
during a Tuesday Evening lecture. That makes the
Gaieties and the Tuesday Evening Lecture Series even
up on breakdowns. It's true, the other times you
could hear the speaker, but. you couldn't have heard
him any better than you'd hear us if he had been
singing instead of speaking, and had been accompanied
by a 16-piece band.
Therefore, the true test of that P.A. is how it works
in our shows. There it h;is to meet its greatest test,
and so far it hasn't passed too high. Therefore, we
have to experiment, and that we have been doing. I
think we improved in the Spring Show last year. This
year we have a new idea that, after preliminary tests,
promises highly satisfactory results.
So, to sum up, we are doing the very best wo can
with the equipment provided. It is good equipment
for lectures, but it needs adaptation for musical shows.
We've been making good progress in our experiments,
and at risk of repeating myself, Larry, you ought to
be able to hear the Gaieties this year unless you forget
to remove those ear-muffs.
I hope wc blast, you out of that four-bit scat.
Sincerely,
Charlie Bulotti
Director '39 Gaieties

Every week Fred Waring plays college songs on
his radio program; last night ho asked for suggestions.
Stanford's "Stanford in Spring" would be beautifully
done by his glee club.
I believe it is one of the Ix'st songs Stanford has,
neglected as it is. and I am sure Waring will have his
glee club sing it if enough letters arc written request
ing it. Twenty-live letters will do it, and the first has
already been sent. 11 is worth writing for
Respect fully.

Dear Larry: It seems that once again wc are con
fronted with that annual bogey-man, the public ad
dress system of the Big Game Gaieties. I agree, as
who wouldn't, that the speaker system thus far has
not been satisfactory. However, my reason for writ
ing is to defend Ram's Head and the Gaieties against
your inference that we .sit. up nights plotting ways for
the P.A. to go dead for our own shows.
First of all, Memorial Hall is not equipped with the
finest type of sound equipment. Secondly, Memorial
Hall is not by any means acoustically perfect. During
last year's Gaieties, the P.A. went dead. That isn't our
fault or the fault of the equipment. That, might happen
at any time. Complete breakdowns will occur. What
wc are working for is better amplification as a whole
with the "perfect equipment" of which you speak.
