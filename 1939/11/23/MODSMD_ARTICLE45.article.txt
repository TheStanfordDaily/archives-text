# Child Soprano Rates Praise As 'Underpup'
## 
### 
Will Gloria Jean succeed Deanna
Durbin as the screen's favorite girl
singer? This question has been asked
by movie magazines, reviewers, and
fans ever since the lirst mention of
Gloiia Jean was made some months
ago.
"The Underpup" does not pro
vide the answer, but it gives a fairly
clear hint. For this round-faced kid
with the snub nose and independent
air can sing; and, what is even more
important, she can act.
STORY WEAK
She romps through a rather weak
story of a poor child thrust into the
snobbish atmosphere of a wealthy
girls' camp with the same ease as she
hits the high notes of her songs
(which, by the way, are the best
part of the show). Her dirty face,
tantrums, and general naturalness
should endear her to audiences bored
with the sugary sweetness of Shir
ley Temple and tixe spoiled bratti
ness of Jane Withers.
This potential successor to Deanna
Durbin looks enough like her rival
to be her sister. She seems very
much more like the little girl around
the corner than Deanna ever did,
however, and it is this quality of
down-to-earthness which is one of
her greatest assets. Her voice lacks
the unusual range and sweetness
that has made Deanna so popular,
but it will probably develop in a
few years.
SUPPORTING CAST FAIR
The supporting cast of "The Un
derpup" includes Nan Gray and
Robert Cummings, who stage a rath
er unconvincing romance when they
are not keeping Gloria Jean from
ducking her tormentors, or stopping
the other girls from teasing Gloria
Jean. C. Aubrey Smith makes a
sufficiently gruff grandfather and
furnishes several good bits of com
edy.
Gloria Jean seems to have what
it takes. With good direction to bring
out her definite flair for comedy,
and better stories she should conn
close to equaling Deanna Durban's
success. —Tremaine
