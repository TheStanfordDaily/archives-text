TUCKED INTO A BOX CANYON near Los Altos is the $5,000,000
Permanente canyon cement plant, now under construction, of which
Henry Kaiser, Jr., Stanford *38, is superintendent. Shown in this view
are the big blending tanks where clay is mixed in proper proportions
with crushed limestone. In the foreground is a section of the mile-long
conveyor belt that carries limestone from quarry to plant. (Photo by
