# Mine Destroys British Vessel
## Seventh Naval Ship Sunk in New Terror 
### United Press 
The wave of U-boat and "wild"
mine terror off the English coasts
has claimed the new British de
stroyer Gipsy with a possible toll of
40 lives, the British Admiralty re
vealed Wednesday night.
Announcement the Gipsy struck a
mine and settled on the bottom with
in sight of the English east coast
came as a government spokesman
was condemning Germany's mine
laying tactics as "the latest abomi
nation of German savagery."
The 1,335-ton Gipsy was the sev
enth British naval vessel to go down
since the start of the war, with a
total of more than 1500 lives lost.
Germany's alleged illegal sowing
of "wild" mines around the British
Isles will bring reprisals within 24
hours in the form of an Allied
blockade of all German exports, en
forced by British and French war
ships. The British ministry of eco
nomic warfare predicted the block
ade would tighten an economic
strangle-hold on Germany and will
"have the effect of shortening the
war."
German planes invaded England,
Scotland, France, and even Belgium.
A German plane was shot down at
sea along the English east, coast
Wednesday night after day-long air
battles near the Thames Estuary
outside London and a bombing and
machine-gunning raid on the north
ern Shetland Islands by six Nazi
planes.
