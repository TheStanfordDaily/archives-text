"Lot' s make this the biggest and
yet the most inexpensive bonfire
we ve ever had," Ken Cuthbertson,
student body president, told Encina
men last night at a pre-bonfire rally.
Cuthbertson warned the frosh to
be especially careful this year about
taking wood from private property,
a*; the A.S.S.U. has had to pay over
$200 in damages every year to prop
erty holders.
Bill McCurdy, chairman of the
bonfire building committee, out
lined to the freshmen the procedure
in building the fire, and the meeting
ended with yells led by Ken Koch
and Gordy Nicoll.
