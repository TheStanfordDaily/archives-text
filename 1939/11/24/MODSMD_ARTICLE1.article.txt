## Pyre Blazes As Cardinals Call for Axe Thousands Jain Brainier Field For Spectacle 
### PAT NOWELL 
Flaming pyre; Flaming spirit!
Higher go the flames . . . In
tense heat . . . Surging emotion.
THERE GOES CAE'S COFFIN!
Higher and higher the flames.
. . . Heat . . . Going to bring
back the Axe . . .
Cal's funeral pyre . . . There's
the band . . . Sing! Sing, you sons
of the Stanford Red.
It's dying down . . . Now —the
Hymn . . .
As the strains of the Stanford
Ilymn died away Stanford men and
women turned to go — each con
vinced of one thing. They're going
to bring back that Axe.
FROSH RELAX
Weary frosh grinned—and relaxed.
Thirty-six hours of working —
guarding against Cal raiders —work-
ing; the bonfire a success.
But it was Stanford's fire. Upper
classmen — Frank, Cuthbertson,
Moore, 'McCurdy, Breckner, Bull,
and many others —slaved and sweat
ed side by side with the frosh to
make it a real Big Game bonfire.
Five hundred gallons of oil were
used. Five thousand dry peach
boxes. Miscellaneous inflammables
collected from miles around. The re
sult—a great red blaze twisting
more than 100 feet into ihe sky.
Encina was burning! No, it was
just the bonfire reflected in a hun
dred Encina windows.
PYRE TREMENDOUS
Cal had burned part of the mate
rial. The work hadn't stalled until
G yesterday morning. But, four
thousand Stanford students and sev
eral thousand other spectators were
convinced the frosh had done a good
job.
And this was the first certified Big
Game bonfire in Stanford history.
Each box, each piece of wood, each
bit of debris had been checked by a
qualified inspection committee which
had been pledged to permit no grand
larceny by over-eager frosh.
The flaming pyre .slowly died
away. The crowd dispersed, and
Stanfordites went away filled with a
new winning spirit — the Big Game
spirit.
