# Troy, Bruins Lead Coast Grid Conference; U.S.C. Favored for Rose Bowl
## 
### BY DOUGLAS GUY 
The Thundering Herd of Troy broke from its pasture again this year
to. rule the I'aciUc Coast Conference football scene.
Although at this writing they are only tied in the percentage column
with U.C.L.A.. Coach Howard Jones' Trojans look well able to handle the

, vutns when the teams meet m tin
closing conference game at Lu.-, An
geles, Dec. !).
Even though U.S.C. now domi
nates the picture, it was oil to a
"bad" start this year when it w;is
tied by Oregon. But since then the
Hose Bowl champs have bowled
everyone in their way.
U-C.L.A.'s chance for a possible
title is due mostly to its star dusky
duo of Kenny Washington and Jackie
Robinson. The pair of Meet-looted
negroes, however, almost met their
Waterloo against Stanford when the
Indians played their best game ot the
year and were only tied when l!nl>-
inson intercepted a last-minute pass
and brought the ball back into .scor
ing position.
O.S.C. THIRD
Oregon State College is in the third
position in the conference picture.
The Beavers have rung up five vic
tories, one more than U.S.C. thus
far, but they were trampled by the
Thundering Herd of Troy.
Another not thern eleven, Oregon,
rests in the number four spot. Wash
ington, off to a slow .start, has kept
its nose above water by victories
over both Stanford and California.
The Washington State Cougars, re
cent conquerors of Stanford, 7 to 0,
are next in line.
And so California and Stanford
are in the damp cellar. The Golden
Bears are a step ahead of the In
dians because of a victory over
W.S.C.
CARDS TOUGHEST'
But Cougar players have been
quoted as saying they think Stan
ord the tougher of the two outfits.
And the fact remains that Stanford
pushed Washington State .ill around
the field—statistically.

O.S.C. THIRD
Oregon State College is in the third
position in the conference picture.
The Beavers have rung up five vic
tories, one more than U.S.C. thus
far, but they were trampled by the
Thundering Herd of Troy.
Another not thern eleven, Oregon,
rests in the number four spot. Wash
ington, off to a slow .start, has kept
its nose above water by victories
over both Stanford and California.
The Washington State Cougars, re
cent conquerors of Stanford, 7 to 0,
are next in line.
And so California and Stanford
are in the damp cellar. The Golden
Bears are a step ahead of the In
dians because of a victory over
W.S.C.

quoted as saying they think Stan

And the fact remains that Stanford
pushed Washington State .ill around
the field—statistically.

U-C.L.A.'s chance for a possible
