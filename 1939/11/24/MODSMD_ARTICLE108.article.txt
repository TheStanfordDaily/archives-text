# Freddie Apostoli Works Out Here
## 
### 
Freddie Apostoli, former world's
middleweight champion and now a
contender in the
division, worked out with Stanford's
boxing squad Wednesday afternoon.
Apostoli was the guest of Jackie
Rice, Card middleweight, and gave
several of the Farm boxers some
experience, Coach Clayton Fryc
stated.
Several novice champions and con
tenders have good chances to make
the varsity squad, Coach Fryc an
nounced. James Thurmond might
fill a gaping hole in the varsity Im
pound class, if he continues to im
prove.
Ken Hosengren, welterweight;
Jack Elliott, light-heavy, and Don
Grant, sophomore heavy, all have
chances of making the varsity squad.
All boxers are now preparing for
the All-University championships to
be held late in January.
