# Horse Polo Squad Rounds into Form
## 
### 
While a battle for positions is still
eing waged, especially at the num
-2 and 3 posts, Coach John
ruth's Stanford horse polo team
slowly rounding into form. After
opping live straight games, the
dians finally broke into the win
ing column last week-end when
i hey defeated the University of
J tali.
At present, Joe Smith is the regu
lar starter at the number 1 spot,
and Len Weisenburg seems a fix
ture in the back position. Ray Con
ner and eGorge Reid are on hand to
take over should either of them
falter.
In the middle of the Card team
there is still a fight for places with
Gale Medlicott and Stan Glikbarg
battling at number 3, and Art La-
Prade and Bob Strom contending
for the number 2 post.
