# Nuggets Win, 6-0, In Gold Bowl Tilt
## 
### 
JUNEAU, Alaska, Nov. 23 (UP).â€”
The Sourdough Nuggets won the
first football game here in 23 years
today with a 6-0 victory over the
B.iranof Bears as the early Alaskan
night held play to the ground.
More than 1,000 persons saw the
first annual Gold Bowl game, and
for many of them it was the first of
their lives. Laid out in the gulch
where Joe Juneau and Dick Harris
first discovered gold, the field was
as nigged as the play of the teams,
collected from mines and construc
tion camps.
