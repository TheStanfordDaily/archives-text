# Tiny Predicts Thrilling Game
## Team Members Have Yet to Whip Bears 
### 
"The two teams may not be on top
of the conference ladder, but it'll
probably be one of the best games on
the coast this year."
So said Indian Coach Tiny Thorn
hill on the eve of the Big Game.
"Most of the members of this squad
have never beaten Cal, even as fresh
men," he continued, "and they really
want to do it this year."
Tiny wouldn't commit himself as
to the outcome. "It'll be a tough
battle." he said, "and the trains are
very evenly matched."
End Coach Jim Lawson had only
three words to say: "It's a toss-up."
Determination was the word
among members of the squad. Their
predictions are as follows:
Captain Stan Andersen, a senior
who has never played on a team that
beat Cal—"This Ls the best chance
we've had to win a Big Game since
I've been here. I think we can
take 'em."
Hamp Pool, who went to U.C. some
years ago—"There's no game on our
schedule I'd rather win."
Andy Stojkovch. another senior
who's never won from the Bears—
"We haven't beaten Cal since I've
been here, and it looks like tomor
row's going to be the day."
Norm Standlee, the Chief, four
yards per try—"We'll really lower
the boom on the Bears, and I think
we'll get the Axe back."
Jim Verdieck, a transfer slated to
start his first Big Game tomorrow —
"I hope we'll be a real Big Red Ma
chine."
