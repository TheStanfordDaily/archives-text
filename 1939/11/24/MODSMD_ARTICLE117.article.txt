laAWKENCE, Kans., Nov. 23 (UP).
â€”The National Corn Husking Cham
pionship has evolved from a mod
est county affair once held to settle
hot stove arguments of local prowess
into a nation-wide competition.
The first bee was held in Des
Moines in 1924 in relative obscurity.
This year's contest drew a crowd of
of over 100,000 and the progress of
the event was broadcast by a nation
wide hookup. Contestants are judged
on the amount of corn picked and
shucked in an 80-minute period.
