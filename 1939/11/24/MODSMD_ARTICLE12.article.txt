# Hilarious '39 Model Gaieties To End Pre-Game Activities
## 
### 
When the curtain rises on the Big Game Gaieties of tonight at
8:15 o'clock, it will mark the next-to-last item on the program to "bring
hack the Axe." The matinee performance at 2:IS o'clock will give half the
Farm a chance to retire early tonight so as to have the edge on their fel

What the Hasty Pudding show is to Harvard, what the Triangle Club is

Bear-trapping by the Indians, the
Big Game Gaieties is a hilarious
campus musical with professional
finish.
While this year's show will be as
big and lavish as ever, the incor

technical director Chet Johnson
promises to make it faster and
smoother. According to Directors

Bulotti and Johnson, the sound sys

Guests of honor at last right's
dress rehearsal were the Stanford
varsity football team members. An
engagement in the stadium at 2
o'clock tomorrow afternoon pre

The songs and romance in the
show will be carried by the vocal
ists. Pat Bernard, Marian Guyscl
man, Georgia Haviland, Eloise Lam
bert, Ruth Martin, Margaret Pay,
Mickey Smith, Hay Stahl. Bob Ste

nine songs in the show, accompanied
by Art McCue and his big IG-piece
band from San Francisco.
A big choral group directed by
Tommy Dec and assisted by Myron
Birnbaum will add tremendously to
the musical side of the show. All
