# Hilarious '39 Model Gaieties To End Pre-Game Activities
## 
### 
When the curtain rises on the Big Game Gaieties of tonight at
8:15 o'clock, it will mark the next-to-last item on the program to "bring
hack the Axe." The matinee performance at 2:IS o'clock will give half the
Farm a chance to retire early tonight so as to have the edge on their fel
lows tomorrow night.
What the Hasty Pudding show is to Harvard, what the Triangle Club is
to Princeton —the Gaieties are to Stanford. A vital adjunct to the annual

Bear-trapping by the Indians, the
Big Game Gaieties is a hilarious
campus musical with professional
finish.
While this year's show will be as
big and lavish as ever, the incor
poration of a revolving stage by
technical director Chet Johnson
promises to make it faster and
smoother. According to Directors

Bulotti and Johnson, the sound sys
tem will be definitely in good work
ing condition.
Guests of honor at last right's
dress rehearsal were the Stanford
varsity football team members. An
engagement in the stadium at 2
o'clock tomorrow afternoon pre
vents their seeing tonight's perfor
mance.
The songs and romance in the
show will be carried by the vocal
ists. Pat Bernard, Marian Guyscl
man, Georgia Haviland, Eloise Lam
bert, Ruth Martin, Margaret Pay,
Mickey Smith, Hay Stahl. Bob Ste
vens, and Brad Young will sing the
nine songs in the show, accompanied
by Art McCue and his big IG-piece
band from San Francisco.
A big choral group directed by
Tommy Dec and assisted by Myron
Birnbaum will add tremendously to
the musical side of the show. All

are by Myron Birnbaum. This is his
fifth Stanford musical and his third j

1 WARM SPRINGS, Ga.. Nov. 23
! (UP). — President Roosevelt denied
i reports tonight that he has sum
moned American ambassadors to
J major European powers home for
' consultations and reports.
When the curtain rises on the Big Game Gaieties of tonight at
8:15 o'clock, it will mark the next-to-last item on the program to "bring
hack the Axe." The matinee performance at 2:IS o'clock will give half the
Farm a chance to retire early tonight so as to have the edge on their fel
lows tomorrow night.
What the Hasty Pudding show is to Harvard, what the Triangle Club is
to Princeton —the Gaieties are to Stanford. A vital adjunct to the annual

Bear-trapping by the Indians, the
Big Game Gaieties is a hilarious
campus musical with professional
finish.
While this year's show will be as
big and lavish as ever, the incor
poration of a revolving stage by
technical director Chet Johnson
promises to make it faster and
smoother. According to Directors

Bulotti and Johnson, the sound sys
tem will be definitely in good work
ing condition.
Guests of honor at last right's
dress rehearsal were the Stanford
varsity football team members. An
engagement in the stadium at 2
o'clock tomorrow afternoon pre
vents their seeing tonight's perfor
mance.
The songs and romance in the
show will be carried by the vocal
ists. Pat Bernard, Marian Guyscl
man, Georgia Haviland, Eloise Lam
bert, Ruth Martin, Margaret Pay,
Mickey Smith, Hay Stahl. Bob Ste
vens, and Brad Young will sing the
nine songs in the show, accompanied
by Art McCue and his big IG-piece
band from San Francisco.
A big choral group directed by
Tommy Dec and assisted by Myron
Birnbaum will add tremendously to
the musical side of the show. All
musical arrangement* in the show
are by Myron Birnbaum. This is his
fifth Stanford musical and his third j
Gaieties on the musical side,
A BIRD'S-EYE VIEW
And here's the show in brief:
Overture—by Birnbaum, done by i
McCue and all the lads.

with the entire cast doing a ditty in j

John Lawry in a take-off on writing

! (UP). — President Roosevelt denied
i reports tonight that he has sum
moned American ambassadors to
J major European powers home for
' consultations and reports.
When the curtain rises on the Big Game Gaieties of tonight at
8:15 o'clock, it will mark the next-to-last item on the program to "bring
hack the Axe." The matinee performance at 2:IS o'clock will give half the
Farm a chance to retire early tonight so as to have the edge on their fel
lows tomorrow night.
What the Hasty Pudding show is to Harvard, what the Triangle Club is
to Princeton —the Gaieties are to Stanford. A vital adjunct to the annual

Bear-trapping by the Indians, the
Big Game Gaieties is a hilarious
campus musical with professional
finish.
While this year's show will be as
big and lavish as ever, the incor
poration of a revolving stage by
technical director Chet Johnson
promises to make it faster and
smoother. According to Directors

Bulotti and Johnson, the sound sys
tem will be definitely in good work
ing condition.
Guests of honor at last right's
dress rehearsal were the Stanford
varsity football team members. An
engagement in the stadium at 2
o'clock tomorrow afternoon pre
vents their seeing tonight's perfor
mance.

show will be carried by the vocal
ists. Pat Bernard, Marian Guyscl
man, Georgia Haviland, Eloise Lam
bert, Ruth Martin, Margaret Pay,
Mickey Smith, Hay Stahl. Bob Ste
vens, and Brad Young will sing the
nine songs in the show, accompanied

band from San Francisco.

Tommy Dec and assisted by Myron
Birnbaum will add tremendously to

fifth Stanford musical and his third j
