# Freshmen Gridders Graduate to Varsity
## Cole Rated Among Nine 'Best Bets' Fullback Vucinich Resembles Bobby Grayson as Plunger 
### CHUCK SMITH 
From every freshman football
squad there are bound to be a few
standout prospective varsity men
but seldom a total of nine as is die
case of the football lettermen of the
class of '43.
This season's yearling squad had
a highly successful season with five
victories and only one defeat —that a
heartbreaking one-point loss to the
powerful U.S.C. Trobabes, 13-12.
The most prominent Card victory
was that over their arch rivals, die
California freshmen, 13-6.
Though the trend in football is
toward big men there are a couple
of mighty miugets that dominatec
the Papooses' backfield this year tha.
are liable to be big threats during,
their varsity career.
COLE SPARKPLUGS FROSII
First of these is A1 Cole, the real
sparkplug of the team. Cole's pass
ing was sensational and he was i
capable jack-of-all-trades, doing the
punting, punt returning, signal call
ing, and much of the ball carrying, j
The other is little .Eric Armstrong, j
who was kept out most of the sea- '
son by a knee injury. However, j
Coach Harry Shipkey saw enough
ability in Armstrong during the
practice sessions and during the
games in which he played to predict
for him a bright varsity career.
Another frosh ball player who is
bound to be an asset from his quar
terback position to any varsity club
is San Jose's Chuck Taylor. It was
Chuck's blocking that really made,
the frosh's ground attack roll and his
team mates appreciated his work
by electing him most valuable man
at the after-season banquqet.
RESEMBLES GRAYSON
Milt Vucinich, whose running so
resembles Bobby Grayson s, is an
other who will do a lot of ball carry
ing lor the varsity. Another back
field man who deserves mention as a
future varsity prospect is Red Rob
inson. Red functioned from either
halfback position and was especially
valuable lor his punting.
Of the frosh linemen who will be
able to stand up under the pressure
of varsity line play there seem to
be only four.
Foremost among these were Ship
key's first string guards from Okla
homa, Ed McCain and Dick Palmer.
Both these boys seemed to reach
their peak against U.S.C. and Cali
fornia where the go.ng was tne
toughest. Ed is the submarine type
of guard who knifes through now
and then to stop the ball player be
fore he gets started. He also oper
ated as running guard, bearing the
brunt of the blocking.
GUARDS FAST
On the other hand Palmer seemed
to play the waiting game, rearing up
to throw back the ball carrier when
he reached the line of scrimmage.
Both he and McCain arc fast and did
some fine punt coverage in the sea
son just passed.
Another lineman t > watch is Bruno
Banducci. 200 pounds of top-notch
tackle. Bruno moves fast for his
weight and bothered many an op
posing punter and passer who
wanted time to get that ball away.
liie fourth linem;,n is one of ,he
best end prospects to hit the school,
"Hard Luck" Hank Norbevg. Though
Hank saw very little real action, he
established himself early in the
practice season as a rugged, fast,
hard hitter.

Another frosh ball player who is
bound to be an asset from his quar
terback position to any varsity club
is San Jose's Chuck Taylor. It was
Chuck's blocking that really made,
the frosh's ground attack roll and his
team mates appreciated his work
by electing him most valuable man
at the after-season banquqet.
RESEMBLES GRAYSON
Milt Vucinich, whose running so
resembles Bobby Grayson s, is an
other who will do a lot of ball carry
ing lor the varsity. Another back
field man who deserves mention as a
future varsity prospect is Red Rob
inson. Red functioned from either
halfback position and was especially
valuable lor his punting.
Of the frosh linemen who will be
able to stand up under the pressure
of varsity line play there seem to
be only four.
Foremost among these were Ship
key's first string guards from Okla
homa, Ed McCain and Dick Palmer.
Both these boys seemed to reach
their peak against U.S.C. and Cali
fornia where the go.ng was tne
toughest. Ed is the submarine type
of guard who knifes through now
and then to stop the ball player be
fore he gets started. He also oper
ated as running guard, bearing the
brunt of the blocking.
GUARDS FAST
On the other hand Palmer seemed
to play the waiting game, rearing up
to throw back the ball carrier when
he reached the line of scrimmage.
Both he and McCain arc fast and did
some fine punt coverage in the sea
son just passed.
Another lineman t > watch is Bruno
Banducci. 200 pounds of top-notch
tackle. Bruno moves fast for his
weight and bothered many an op
posing punter and passer who
wanted time to get that ball away.
liie fourth linem;,n is one of ,he
best end prospects to hit the school,
"Hard Luck" Hank Norbevg. Though
Hank saw very little real action, he
established himself early in the
practice season as a rugged, fast,
hard hitter.

Barney Berlinger, former decathlon
champion from the University of

title with a record of 181 teet 1-3 !
title with a recor dof 181 feet 1 3 j

From every freshman football
squad there are bound to be a few
standout prospective varsity men

This season's yearling squad had
a highly successful season with five
victories and only one defeat —that a
heartbreaking one-point loss to the
powerful U.S.C. Trobabes, 13-12.
The most prominent Card victory
was that over their arch rivals, die
California freshmen, 13-6.
Though the trend in football is

are liable to be big threats during,
