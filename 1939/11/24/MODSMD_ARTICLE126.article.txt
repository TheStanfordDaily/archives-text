j With the spotlight on the gridiron
i all fall, it is hard to realize that bas
| ketball season is less than two weeks
; away. But on Dec. 1 Everett Dean's
i varsity cagers will clash with the
! U.S.F. Dons in the season opener in
I the Pavilion.
Three days later the team will
j meet the Olympic Club, also in the
local gym, and then start work pre
paring for their Eastern tour which
will include games with Nebraska,
| Rutgers, Dartmouth, Columbia, and
i Wisconsin.
| Coast Conference play gets under
j way for the Indians wiih a two
j game U.C.L.A. series Jan. 12 and 13.
Don Burness, big center who was
I out for a great part of last year with
j a bad knee, will see plenty of action
I this winter along with Kenny Da
! vidson, Don Williams, and Gil Rahn.
All four are lettermen from last year.
Two of the 1938-39 season's out
i standing frosh, Bob Penn, 6-foot 5-
' inch forward, and Bill Cowden, a

guard, are playing their first year on
the varsity and are expected to be
key men.
Anderson and Wensel, Modesto
J.C. transfers, will add strength to
the cage squad, probably as alter
nates.
After several weeks in September
of outdoor conditioning, and a great
deal of work on fundamentals later
in the fall, the team is bearing down
in the workouts in anticipation of
their opening game.
