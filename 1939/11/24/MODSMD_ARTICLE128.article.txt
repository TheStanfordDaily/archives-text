University, Thornhill replaced his
former chief as head coach.

Thomhill's right-hand man, was an

from 1923 to 1925.
"Husky" Hunt, who was head bas
ketball coach here in the early '20's,
now holds the responsible position
of chief scout on the coaching staff.
Ear] Hoos, backfield mentor and
first-string quarterback on the 1936
varsity, was an outstanding signal
caller and blocker in his college
days.
One of the greatest blockers in the
history of Stanford football, Robert
"Bones" Hamilton was an integral
part of the Vow Boys' backfield for
three years.
