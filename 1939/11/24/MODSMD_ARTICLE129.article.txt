# Indian Rooters to Face Bears In Crucial Battle Tomorrow
## Cuthbertson Shifted to Forward; Dick Harmon to Start at Right Half 
### 
There'll be one championship set
ed between Stanford and California
omorrow, and it won't be football.
With the California intercollegiate
joccer title and gold soccer balls at
stake, the Indians will be out to
vvhip the Bears on the local field at
.0 o'clock, and at the same time
.•uin C'al's conference crown uspira
dons.
Should the clubs deadlock again
as they did last week, 1-1, at Berke
ley, the intercollegiates will be de
jiaed the iollowing Saturday. How
ever, it will be a fast field as com
pared to the sloppy Edwards Field
ast week, and there may be lots of
scoring.
FITLE HOPES DIM
Cal's hopes for the Northern Cali
iornia soccer title were severely
,olted by the tie last week, it being
lieir fourth deadlock. However, the
Jears still hold onto a slim niathe
natical chance to snare the lead from
.he University of San Francisco and
ian Jose State.
Coach Harry Maloney's eleven
jloses its season against If.C.L.A. in
. non-conlerence tilt, Nov. 2d, and
. .S.F., here, Dec. 4. Victories to
lorrow and against the Dons would
it the Indians in third place.
Against the Bears last week, the
j.ndian forwards clicked in the open
ng minutes for a goal, but the Bears
ame back to boot one in. From there
jn in it was a furious battle of the
>rwards and backs with both sidet
eatening a number of times but
ting no farther.
aNZ-AGERO GOOD
Stanford's Tito Sanz-Agero staved
.£ Cal potential goals and was by
tr the outstanding Card on the

field. Stanford backs also playec. j
bang-up ball.
Coach Maloney's chief problem !
this season has been in attempting to I
find a starting unit which would
click offensively and defensively. I
Although he had potentially the best
material in yetirs, Maloney continu- [
ally shuffled his forwards trying to i
find a high-scoring unit.
Ken Cuthb&rtson was shifted to I
the front line in place of Pellas, who ]
was sent to the Rest Home. The '
move was intended to put a little !
life into the forwards. Dick Harmon i
will start at Cuthbertson's old posi- ;
.ion.
