### 
jSymbolizing the 47-year-old rivalry between
Stanford and California, the historic Axe has not
been seen on the Farm since Big Game day of
1936.
Originally flaunted by the Cardinals before
the Cal rooting section at a baseball game in 1899,
it was stolen by a group of Berkeley men and
spirited to the other side of the Bay where it was
kept for 30 years.
On April 3, 1930, the night of the annual Cal
Axe Rally, "the immortal 21" Sequoia men seized
the prize as it was being returned to its bank vault
by Custodian Norman Horner, upper right. Lead
ers of the group are shown, upper left.
Next morning excited members of the "500"
read the news on English Corner, while B.A.C.
Manager A1 Masters and A.S.S.U. President Jerry
Trautmann deposited the trophy in a Palo Alto
bank.
Later that year the Axe was made a perpetual
prize for the winner of the Big Game. Cal rally
committeemen are pictured, lower right, display
ing it at last year's game.
