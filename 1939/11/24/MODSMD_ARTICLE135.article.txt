# Gridman's Game Day
## 
### 
Jypical of the Stanford football player's game day is a Saturday
in the life of rugged, red-headed Gene Coldiron, first-string block
ing quarterback. Noted for his aggressiveness and spirit on the
field, Coldiron, a senior from Hoquiam, Washington, is also an
outstanding leader in campus activities.
Pictured from left to right, "Scrappy," as he is known to his
friends, begins his day with a healthy breakfast in the Cellar of
Encina Hall, where he is a freshman sponsor. A history major, he
attends a 10 o'clock class on Saturday morning, and dresses for
the game in the team's locker room shortly after noon.
Lower left, he is seen running out onto the field with Tackle
Bill Trout to warm up before the kick-off. During the game he is
snapped in the act of smashing down an enemy blocker.
Lower right, Coldiron is shown refreshing himself in a hot
shower after the final gun. And to vary the routine of tackling
and blocking, he takes his girl, Lucile Banol, to a show in Paly
that evening. Just before he gets into bed "Scrappy" surveys the
Sunday morning sports section to review the day's happenings
before he lives them again in his dreams.
