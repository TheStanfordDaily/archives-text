# Spirit Soars As Rallyers Jam Pavilion
## Roble Gamers Sweepstakes In Card Parade 
### CHARLES BULL 
Big Game week. Big Game
Rally. A jammed Pavilion. A
rollicking parade.
night Stanford proved to
itself and to everyone else that
whatever spirit may prevail dur
ing the rest of the year, Big Game
is different.
It is different because last night
Stanford turned out en masse to a
float parade and a Big Game Rally
with every bit of fighting spirit that
any group of students, large or small,
could possibly muster.
RALLYERS CHEER
With the Pavilion jammed to over
capacity, Coach Tiny Thornhill
forcefully told a cheering, yelling
crowd of rallyers that "We haven't
lost to California, and we don't ex
pect to lose to California." Tiny also
delivered a stinging accusation of
muck-raking sports writers "who
have tried to discredit Stanford's
team and the University."
First of the guest speakers, Paul
Speegle, '30, ex-head yell leader,
proved that he can still lead a mean
yell when he tackled the "new
spell," and made a hit with modern
Stanfordites with his witty words
and actions.
KEENE SPEAKS
A.S.U.C. President Jim Keene
brought beiit wishes from Cal and
an authentic map showing how to
get to the Big "C," which he would
present to any frosh bearing a hair
less head.
Had the rally continued much
longer the yells would have lasted
all night. They started with five
rahs, progressed as time went on
to six, twelve, and thirteen, as John
ny Seamans and Lloyd Whitman,
yell kings from the rival camps, tried
to outdo each other. All the yells
shook the steel rafters of the Pa
vilion, as only Big Game yells can
shake them, with the "Axe Yell"
highlighting the whole celebration.
Ex-A.S.S.U. President Bob Brown,
recalling the large scores of past Big
Games, pointed to the female-filled
north bleachers of the Pavilion and
stated, "We didn't have that, then."
He presented a supposed traditional
charm pair of red socks to Johnny
Seamans, which are supposed to
help win the Big Gome for Stanford,
ROBLE WINS

Garnering (heir second consecutive
sweepstakes win in the annual Big
Game float parade, the misses from
Roble decried the lack of male ini
tiative in asking them for Big Game
night dates with a colorful float of
true prize-winning caliber. A mam
moth number 5171 switchboard on
a truck displaying typical Roble
dates was followed by more than a
hundred anxious women all at

night Stanford proved to
itself and to everyone else that
whatever spirit may prevail dur
ing the rest of the year, Big Game
is different.
It is different because last night
Stanford turned out en masse to a
float parade and a Big Game Rally
with every bit of fighting spirit that
any group of students, large or small,
could possibly muster.
RALLYERS CHEER
With the Pavilion jammed to over
capacity, Coach Tiny Thornhill
forcefully told a cheering, yelling
crowd of rallyers that "We haven't
lost to California, and we don't ex
pect to lose to California." Tiny also
delivered a stinging accusation of
muck-raking sports writers "who
have tried to discredit Stanford's
team and the University."
First of the guest speakers, Paul
Speegle, '30, ex-head yell leader,
proved that he can still lead a mean
yell when he tackled the "new
spell," and made a hit with modern
Stanfordites with his witty words
and actions.
KEENE SPEAKS
A.S.U.C. President Jim Keene
brought beiit wishes from Cal and
an authentic map showing how to
get to the Big "C," which he would
present to any frosh bearing a hair
less head.
Had the rally continued much
longer the yells would have lasted
all night. They started with five
rahs, progressed as time went on
to six, twelve, and thirteen, as John
ny Seamans and Lloyd Whitman,
yell kings from the rival camps, tried
to outdo each other. All the yells
shook the steel rafters of the Pa
vilion, as only Big Game yells can
shake them, with the "Axe Yell"
highlighting the whole celebration.
Ex-A.S.S.U. President Bob Brown,
recalling the large scores of past Big
Games, pointed to the female-filled
north bleachers of the Pavilion and
stated, "We didn't have that, then."
He presented a supposed traditional
charm pair of red socks to Johnny
Seamans, which are supposed to
help win the Big Gome for Stanford,
