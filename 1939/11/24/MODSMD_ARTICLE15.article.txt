### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
|K the United States declares war,
there's a good chance you'll be in
uniform within 30 days.
Millions of Americans are totally
ignorant of the vast machinery that
has been prepared by the Joint
Army and Navy Selective Service
Committee to whip the nation into
shape for modern warfare. But, if
you're an eligible young fighter,
you'll know about it soon enough.
The government's ready to eon
script you. There'll be no delay,
no loss of valuable time as there
was in '17. Suppose Congress de
clares war. The morning after
(lie declaration, you'll pick up
your Oaily ami discover that the
President will speak over the larg
est radio hook-up ever arranged.
You listen to the President. He
tells you, if you're between the
ages of 21 and 30, to report to
your regular voting place within a
week. And, during that week, a
tremendous blast of publicity is
released—by poster, radio, news
paper.
CTANDING beside the line of men
K at your balloting place are sev
eral policemen.
Someone may begin to speak of
the futility and evil of war. He'll
lx* hustled away by the officers.
There'll be no talk of constitutional
rights. All that is forgotten.
Then you'll sign a card. It'll be
numbered. Maybe you're number
1211 in your district. The moment
your name is written on that card,
you're subject to military law. In
the same week, probably 12 million
other men have signed cream
coloi-ed cards. They'll be your war
time buddies.
Four days later, the government
holds its first gigantic lottery—a
lottery in human llesh. The Presi
dent draws the first number. At
your radio, you'll listen to the list
of numbers that are picked from
time to time. Finally they choose
yours—number 12.1. Five days
later you receive a long, compli
cated questionnaire. It's even
harder to fill out than Stanford's
application for admission. In ev
ery state cupltol today copies of
that questionnaire are ready to be
rushed to press.
A COUPLE of days after you mail
the questionnaire back to the
local Selective Service Board, you
net a note that says you're in Group
I. That means there's no reason why
you shouldn't be placed in military
service. Class II includes those, who
are engaged in necessary labor —
manufacturing munitions or raising
wheat. Class 111 means you have a
dependent family. And Class IV in
dicates that you're physically dis
abled.
When you pass your physical ex
am nine days later, you report to
camp. You're there with 300,000
other Americans. You're a member
of the United States' fighting force.
You're a private and you wear a
uniform and carry a gun. It's a
great feeling to be serving your
country. And you're ready to fight
the Germans or the Japanese or
whomever they tell you to.
All this is arranged for you. Be
cause, you see, America is pre
pared!

wheat. Class 111 means you have a
dependent family. And Class IV in
dicates that you're physically dis
abled.
When you pass your physical ex
am nine days later, you report to
camp. You're there with 300,000
other Americans. You're a member
of the United States' fighting force.
You're a private and you wear a
uniform and carry a gun. It's a
great feeling to be serving your
country. And you're ready to fight
the Germans or the Japanese or
whomever they tell you to.
All this is arranged for you. Be
cause, you see, America is pre
pared!
|K the United States declares war,
there's a good chance you'll be in
uniform within 30 days.
Millions of Americans are totally
ignorant of the vast machinery that
has been prepared by the Joint
Army and Navy Selective Service
Committee to whip the nation into
shape for modern warfare. But, if
you're an eligible young fighter,
you'll know about it soon enough.
The government's ready to eon
script you. There'll be no delay,
no loss of valuable time as there
was in '17. Suppose Congress de
clares war. The morning after
(lie declaration, you'll pick up
your Oaily ami discover that the
President will speak over the larg
est radio hook-up ever arranged.
You listen to the President. He
tells you, if you're between the
ages of 21 and 30, to report to
your regular voting place within a
week. And, during that week, a
tremendous blast of publicity is
released—by poster, radio, news
paper.
CTANDING beside the line of men
K at your balloting place are sev
eral policemen.
Someone may begin to speak of
the futility and evil of war. He'll
lx* hustled away by the officers.
There'll be no talk of constitutional
rights. All that is forgotten.
Then you'll sign a card. It'll be
numbered. Maybe you're number
1211 in your district. The moment
your name is written on that card,
you're subject to military law. In
the same week, probably 12 million
other men have signed cream
coloi-ed cards. They'll be your war
time buddies.
Four days later, the government
holds its first gigantic lottery—a
lottery in human llesh. The Presi
dent draws the first number. At
your radio, you'll listen to the list
of numbers that are picked from
time to time. Finally they choose
yours—number 12.1. Five days
later you receive a long, compli
cated questionnaire. It's even
harder to fill out than Stanford's
application for admission. In ev
ery state cupltol today copies of
that questionnaire are ready to be
rushed to press.
A COUPLE of days after you mail
the questionnaire back to the
local Selective Service Board, you
net a note that says you're in Group
I. That means there's no reason why
you shouldn't be placed in military
service. Class II includes those, who
are engaged in necessary labor —
manufacturing munitions or raising
wheat. Class 111 means you have a
dependent family. And Class IV in
dicates that you're physically dis
abled.
