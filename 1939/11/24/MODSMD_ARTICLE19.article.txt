# Game Bonfire Spectacle Brings History to Date
## 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
Death, as it must to all sinners, came last night (o the lowly Golden
i Bear.
Yesterday was Judgment Day for the California tree-climber. And he
; got his due. He died a slow, tortuous death that was too good for such as
heâ€”a death earned by a dissolute life. They teased him, poked sticks in

his eyes, singed his lurry hide,<
dragged him around the arena that
was so soon lo prove his linal un
doing.
He was scalped, skinned alive, and
prepared for the feast in the best
Indian tradition; they ceremoniously
tossed him on the funeral pyre and
he was roasted in efiigy to a glorious
brown.
BEGAN IN '92
And tradition is like that. Any
one knows why it was done, but no
one is exactly sure when they .started
the bonfire tradition. Old-timers,
like Mayfield Ike over at the foot
ball field, or references like the tiles
in the Daily Shack, will tell you
they first roasted the Bear 'way back
in the Dark Ages sometime around
'92, when the Indians first chased the
Bear in a game of hide and seek.
But maybe the 1939 tribe can re
member back as far as '29, the year
some of the boys derailed the old
Toonerville trolley that used to run
from Paly to the campus, broke it
up, and piled it on the blaze. It was
all right, though, because the street
car company announced they didn't
want it anyway. Service was dis
continued.
Advancing history to the year of
'.'l3, they say it wasn't compulsory to
cremate the fuzzy creature from up
north; the grid squad took care of
that angle to the tune of 7 to 3. And
anyway, that year attention was
centered on the lynching of two
slayers who were snatched from the
county jail by ;i mob of 20,000 down
in San Jose.
AXE COMES HOME
Then came '35, the year U.C.'s
hopes symbolically went up in smoke
at a bonfire which attracted 10,000
frenzied rooters. The Bear was an
nihilated 13-0. That year the Axe
was on hand for the first time at any
rally; "Doodles" Weaver, ex-Farm
funny man, was in his prime; and a
new song was written, "Get on the
Big Red Toboggan," to the tune of
"Put on Your Old Gray Bonnet."
In '36 Cal plotted to set off the Big
Game pyre prematurely, and stopped
at nothing short of an incendiary
bomb, concealed in the pile of ma
terial that formed the bonfire. How
ever, the plot w;ts foiled when Philip
Kellerman and Douglas Bryan laid
just claims to immortality by dis

covering the infernal machine before
it exploded. This was the year the
Stanford women rated "Jeemy" Cof
fis the ladies' favorite on the grid
squad.
Last year Roble women continued
j the tradition of serving lunches to
the bonfire workers, and the pile
rose just as high and burned as
brightly as ever before, only the Cal
men managed to beat the Indians 6-0.
And this year the Bear was early
I to his own funeral. He waxed over
| anxious, and came down Tuesday
night to burn what little wood had
already been accumulated by En
cinamen. But last night the entire
Stanford Indian tribe held their tra
ditional ceremonial to slaughter and
roast Cal's lowly symbol the same
as they have done for years gone
by . . . and will continue to do for
years to come.
