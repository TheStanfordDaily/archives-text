### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 23 (UP).
—The Industrial Accident Commis
sion has recommended a reduction
on rates for workmen's compensa
tion insurance which would save
California employers an estimated
$8,000,000 a year, Chairman George
G. Kidwell announced here tonight.
Kidwell disclosed his report to
Gov. Culbert Olson had suggested
a 26.8 per cent reduction in rates,
based on costs of the state fund
which writes about 30 per cent of
total insurance and on a study of
private insurance company costs.
Orv Mohler of U.S.C. holds the
all-time high scoring lead for one
season in the Coast Conference—B4
points.
