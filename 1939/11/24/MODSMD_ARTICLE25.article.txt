# Irwin Advises Best Ways Of Avoiding Traffic Jams, Parking Tie-Ups at Game
## Convenience, Safety of 60,000 Fans Will Be Assured Through Efforts Of B.A.C. Assistant, 1200 Helpers 
### JACK DALTON 
The IJ.A.C. takes over the functions of a good-sized city every Big Game
at Stanford. With his 1200 helpers, practically all students, Jake Irwin,
IJ.A.C. assistant, discharges all the duties necessary to the well-being of
oyer (>O,OOO fun-seeking fans.
"People seldom realize," says Irwin, ' that we're fulfilling many of the
functions of a city of about 250,000 when we handle so many fans in one

crowd. We're giving them traffic,
lice, first-aid, and fire services, sell
ing them tickets, piograms, and re
fi'eshments, and directing them in
and out of the parking lots and
stadium."
Big Game parking and traffic prob
lems are Jake's chief worries. "Fans
feeling good, out for a big time, and
thinking they know all about the best
place to park and how to get there,
are what bring us misery," he com
plained. Jake has a very simple but
thorough plan, whereby everybody
can be parked in such a way that the
Jols can be cleared in an hour and
a half after the final pun.
SOMETIMES COMPLICATED
At least it's simple on paper, but
when you try to tell some alumnus,
in his second childhood and feeling
high for the annual classic, just how
to go about parking and driving to
and from the stadium, then the
plan gets complicated.
There won't be any crossing traffic
at tomorrow's Big Game to cause
excessive horn-tooting, swearing,
and assorted forms of ill-will be
tween drivers if they will paik where
Irwin's helpers direct them. Through
traffic will be routed around the
University between 11 a.m. and un
til the grounds are cleared. Here are
Irwin's instructions to motorists:
For students coming from places
on campus — take either Galvez
Street and park on the l'rosh soccer
field north of Angell Field, or Ar
guello Street and park on the var
sity soccer field, the old baseball
grounds, or, if necessary, inside the
varsity football practice field. This
will eliminate crossing lanes of cars
attempting to get off-campus.
