BERKELEY, Nov* 23 (UP).—Dr.
Robert Gordon Sproul, University
of California president, said tonight
the state university would "do ev
erything in its power" to keep Pro
lessor E. O. Lawrence, inventor of
tlie cyclotron and Nobel Prize win
ner, at the university.
He expressed hope state aid would
be forthcoming to assist in keeping
Lawrence at the California school.
The famed physicist last week re
ceived an offer from the University
of Texas promising him funds nec
essary to build a 3.000-ton cyclotron,
a device with which Lawrence hopes
to explore regions of energies in the
atom, above one million volts.
