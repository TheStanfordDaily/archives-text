# War Relations To Labor Told
## Eliel Story Predicts Effects of Conflict 
### 
A rise in wages but a sacrifice of
many of its hard-earned rights
would be the lot of labor if war
came to the United States, Profes
sor Paul Eliel of Stanford Univer
sity predicts in an article in the De
cember issue of the Atlantic Monthly
magazine.
The Stanford professor of indus
trial relations, in his discussion of
"Labor and the War," also warned
American industry that, if the pres
ent European conflict continues for
any length of time, increases in
production will result in a shortage
of labor despite our many millions
of unemployed.
Fighting a war. he predicted,
would force modification or aban
donment of wage and hour limita
tions and might substitute com
pulsory mediation for the unlimited
right to strike.
One of the most difficult prob
lems, Professor Eliel said, would be
to work out procedures affecting the
freedom of workers to move from
one industry or area to another.
How limitations may be placed on
profits without at the same time im
posing impossible limitations on the
war procurement program, he con
cluded. is a problem which has
been sharply outlined by the war
in Europe as one of the most im
portant factors in a national defense
program.
