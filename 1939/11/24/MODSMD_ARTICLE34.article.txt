# AXE IS ON BLOCK AGAIN
## 
### WILSON CANNON 
1 IVE 'EM . . . the AXE!"
Through the haze ot tradition
that over-hangs the sandstone
buildings ot Stanford's Quad, none
is more sacred to Farm undergrad
uates; none more inspiring to teams
battling for the Cardinal; none that
can bring more vivid memories to
Farm graduates than the story of
the Stanford Axo.
Today, The Stanford Daily pre
sents a brief history of the symbol j
that has made so indelible a mark ;
on all who ever were associated with I
this university. For 31 years the
Stanford Axe was the lode-stone for
fistic rivalry between Stanford and
California. Since 1933 that .same Axe j
has been the trophy which marks
supremacy on the gridiron for one
of these two universities.
The hatchet has been buried . . .
but not the Axe.
* * *
\Y HEN, in 1933, the Axe was of
ferrcd as symbol of victory in
the Stanford - California yearly
gridiron classic, it marked the end
ing of an inter-university rivalry
that iiad stretched over three
decades.
This period was marked by the
possession of the trophy by Cali
fornia from 1X1)9 until 1930. Kept
in hiding throughout each year,
it was reserved to keynote each
rally held before a Rig Game.
Cardinal attempts to recapture the
prize met with failure until 1930.
when Sequoia's immortal twenty
one successfully brought the Axe
back to the Farm.
The Stanford Axe was born on
April 13, 1899. This great tomahawk,
boasting a 15-inch blade, keynoted
one of the biggest rally's ever held
on the Farm, held Stanford students
in fascination as undergraduate
leaders used the blade as a precious
symbol of victory.
Dull, and not an effective weapon,
! the Axe was sharpened on an enor
mous grindstone before the eyes of a
delighted student body.
Then it. was tested upon the neck
of a Blue and Gold effigy. With one
stroke, the now-keen blade severed
the dummy's head cleanly from the
i body, the signal for a vociferous ser
-1 pentine dance about the bonfire and
! the Axe that lasted far into the
night.
Two days later the Farm bowed
j to a superb California team. But a
stunned student-body forgot the
| defeat when it found that it had lost
the Axe.
Overpowering four Stanford
j guards, an estimated crowd of 300
| California rooters seized the symbol
and made their triumphant way
j back to Berkeley . . . thus starting
one of the most heralded collegiate
I leuds in history.
The list of Stanford attempts to
j regain the trophy began that same
' night. At a wild, impromptu Cali
j fornia rally Stanford men mingled
I with the joyous students in a valiant
attempt to recapture the Axe. But
j their work came to naught.
* # *
31 years the Axe remained
the target for Stanford at
tempt after Stanford attempt to
regain their lost dignity. Innu
merable plans, timed to perfec
tion. almost succeeded in re-cap
turing the trophy, only to fail
I through hard-luck on the part of
the Cardinal rescue parties.
The California scheme of keeping
the Axe in a bank vault during

these years, taking it out only for'
the Big Game rally, seemed impreg
nable.
One of the most famous Stanford
attempts at reprisal was the Cardi
nal raid upon the time-hallowed
California Senior Fence. Located
near Berkeley's North Hall, it was
built in the shape of a gigantic
Block C. Only seniors were allowed
to sit upon this landmark, and
proudly they had carved their names
upon it and left it to posterity.
Shortly after the seizure of the
Axe, a squad of 24 Cardinal stal
warts set out for Berkeley. Dividing
into three groups, they outwitted
California defenders and success
fully transported the old fence,
piece by piece, back to the Palo Alto
campus.

Their plan failed, for California
chose to look upon the matter as a
joke. Stanford kept the fence as
hostage and finally burned it as a
jinx.
The recapture of the Axu seemed
more of an impossibility train ever.
Subsequent attempts appeared for
ever doomed.
But. an immortal band of twenty
one men made the dream of recap
ture of the Axe a realization.
»|t * *
April (>, 1930. California held
its customary pre-game rally,
with the Axe as the center of the
celebration. Members of the Stan
ford group were present, and
when the armored car started for

the bank with its precious cargo,
maneuvered into positions on the
running hoard of (lie car.
Ten minutes before the rally
closed, live others of the Stanford
group drove to the bank, backed
their car onto the sidewalk, and
rigged up a camera in the rumble
se.it. Other Stanford men were sta
tioned in strategic points about the
bank door.
Nervously waiting in their posi
tions, the Cardinal band greeted the
arrival of the steel-covered car
with cries of "Let's have a good shot
of the Axe!" The California guards
drew back, and as the Axe custodian
stepped from the rear of the car an
overloaded shot of flashlight powder
was released with a blinding flash.
Dropping on the shoulders of the
Axe custodian, one Stanford stal
wart wrenched the Axe from his
hands, passed it through several
hands to the camera car.
* * +
AS TIIE AXE was stowed in the
car, a tear-gas bomb was
dropped directly in front of the
bank, causing the mob of Califor
i nia students to scatter in all direc
tions.
Fifty minutes later, eluding all
i pusuit, the Stanford group brought
i the trophy back to the Stanford
campus. Pandemonium greeted its
arrival, as hundreds of students
' were wakened from their beds by
I triumphant cries of "We've got the
Axe!"
An impromptu rally was started
at Hoble . . . the first Stanford Axe
rally in 31 years. Men wept to see
the sacred trophy at last regained.
* * *
r |MIE much-fought-over trophy
retired from view for three
years, with Stanford following the
Berkeley lead and keeping it se
cure in a Palo Alto bank vault.
Today the Stanford Axe is once
' again in California hands . . . this
time as a trophy won by victory on
i the football field. Tomorrow we will
j attempt to regain it; not through the
! strategem of twenty-one men and a
tear-gas bomb . . . but through tho
I prowess of eleven men and a pig-
I skin.

drew back, and as the Axe custodian
stepped from the rear of the car an

was released with a blinding flash.
Dropping on the shoulders of the

Through the haze ot tradition
that over-hangs the sandstone
buildings ot Stanford's Quad, none
is more sacred to Farm undergrad
uates; none more inspiring to teams
battling for the Cardinal; none that
can bring more vivid memories to
Farm graduates than the story of
the Stanford Axo.
Today, The Stanford Daily pre
sents a brief history of the symbol j
that has made so indelible a mark ;
on all who ever were associated with I
this university. For 31 years the
Stanford Axe was the lode-stone for

California. Since 1933 that .same Axe j
has been the trophy which marks
supremacy on the gridiron for one
of these two universities.
The hatchet has been buried . . .
but not the Axe.

\Y HEN, in 1933, the Axe was of
ferrcd as symbol of victory in
the Stanford - California yearly
gridiron classic, it marked the end
ing of an inter-university rivalry
that iiad stretched over three
decades.
This period was marked by the
possession of the trophy by Cali
fornia from 1X1)9 until 1930. Kept
in hiding throughout each year,
it was reserved to keynote each
rally held before a Rig Game.
Cardinal attempts to recapture the
prize met with failure until 1930.
when Sequoia's immortal twenty
one successfully brought the Axe
back to the Farm.
The Stanford Axe was born on
April 13, 1899. This great tomahawk,
boasting a 15-inch blade, keynoted
one of the biggest rally's ever held
on the Farm, held Stanford students
in fascination as undergraduate
leaders used the blade as a precious
symbol of victory.
Dull, and not an effective weapon,
! the Axe was sharpened on an enor
mous grindstone before the eyes of a
delighted student body.
Then it. was tested upon the neck
of a Blue and Gold effigy. With one
stroke, the now-keen blade severed
the dummy's head cleanly from the
i body, the signal for a vociferous ser
-1 pentine dance about the bonfire and
! the Axe that lasted far into the
night.
Two days later the Farm bowed
j to a superb California team. But a
stunned student-body forgot the
| defeat when it found that it had lost
the Axe.
Overpowering four Stanford
j guards, an estimated crowd of 300
| California rooters seized the symbol
and made their triumphant way
j back to Berkeley . . . thus starting
one of the most heralded collegiate
I leuds in history.
The list of Stanford attempts to
j regain the trophy began that same
' night. At a wild, impromptu Cali
j fornia rally Stanford men mingled
I with the joyous students in a valiant
attempt to recapture the Axe. But
j their work came to naught.
* # *
31 years the Axe remained
the target for Stanford at
tempt after Stanford attempt to
regain their lost dignity. Innu
merable plans, timed to perfec
tion. almost succeeded in re-cap
turing the trophy, only to fail
I through hard-luck on the part of
the Cardinal rescue parties.
The California scheme of keeping
the Axe in a bank vault during

these years, taking it out only for'
the Big Game rally, seemed impreg
nable.
One of the most famous Stanford
attempts at reprisal was the Cardi
nal raid upon the time-hallowed
California Senior Fence. Located
near Berkeley's North Hall, it was
built in the shape of a gigantic
Block C. Only seniors were allowed
to sit upon this landmark, and
proudly they had carved their names
upon it and left it to posterity.
Shortly after the seizure of the
Axe, a squad of 24 Cardinal stal
warts set out for Berkeley. Dividing
into three groups, they outwitted
California defenders and success
fully transported the old fence,
piece by piece, back to the Palo Alto
campus.

Their plan failed, for California
chose to look upon the matter as a
joke. Stanford kept the fence as
hostage and finally burned it as a
jinx.
The recapture of the Axu seemed
more of an impossibility train ever.
Subsequent attempts appeared for
ever doomed.
But. an immortal band of twenty
one men made the dream of recap
ture of the Axe a realization.

the target for Stanford at
tempt after Stanford attempt to
regain their lost dignity. Innu
merable plans, timed to perfec
tion. almost succeeded in re-cap
turing the trophy, only to fail
I through hard-luck on the part of
the Cardinal rescue parties.
The California scheme of keeping
the Axe in a bank vault during

these years, taking it out only for'
the Big Game rally, seemed impreg
nable.
One of the most famous Stanford
attempts at reprisal was the Cardi
nal raid upon the time-hallowed
California Senior Fence. Located
near Berkeley's North Hall, it was
built in the shape of a gigantic
Block C. Only seniors were allowed
to sit upon this landmark, and
proudly they had carved their names
upon it and left it to posterity.
Shortly after the seizure of the
Axe, a squad of 24 Cardinal stal
warts set out for Berkeley. Dividing
into three groups, they outwitted
California defenders and success
fully transported the old fence,
piece by piece, back to the Palo Alto
campus.

Their plan failed, for California
chose to look upon the matter as a
joke. Stanford kept the fence as
hostage and finally burned it as a
jinx.
The recapture of the Axu seemed
more of an impossibility train ever.
Subsequent attempts appeared for
ever doomed.
But. an immortal band of twenty
one men made the dream of recap
ture of the Axe a realization.

April (>, 1930. California held
its customary pre-game rally,
with the Axe as the center of the
celebration. Members of the Stan
ford group were present, and
when the armored car started for

the bank with its precious cargo,
maneuvered into positions on the
running hoard of (lie car.
Ten minutes before the rally
closed, live others of the Stanford
group drove to the bank, backed
their car onto the sidewalk, and
rigged up a camera in the rumble
se.it. Other Stanford men were sta
tioned in strategic points about the
bank door.
Nervously waiting in their posi
tions, the Cardinal band greeted the
arrival of the steel-covered car
with cries of "Let's have a good shot
of the Axe!" The California guards
drew back, and as the Axe custodian
stepped from the rear of the car an
overloaded shot of flashlight powder
was released with a blinding flash.
Dropping on the shoulders of the
Axe custodian, one Stanford stal
wart wrenched the Axe from his
hands, passed it through several
hands to the camera car.

AS TIIE AXE was stowed in the
car, a tear-gas bomb was
dropped directly in front of the
bank, causing the mob of Califor
i nia students to scatter in all direc
tions.
Fifty minutes later, eluding all
i pusuit, the Stanford group brought
i the trophy back to the Stanford
campus. Pandemonium greeted its
arrival, as hundreds of students
' were wakened from their beds by
I triumphant cries of "We've got the
Axe!"
An impromptu rally was started
at Hoble . . . the first Stanford Axe
rally in 31 years. Men wept to see
the sacred trophy at last regained.

Through the haze ot tradition

buildings ot Stanford's Quad, none
is more sacred to Farm undergrad

the Stanford Axo.
Today, The Stanford Daily pre

on all who ever were associated with I
this university. For 31 years the
Stanford Axe was the lode-stone for

\Y HEN, in 1933, the Axe was of
ferrcd as symbol of victory in
the Stanford - California yearly
gridiron classic, it marked the end
ing of an inter-university rivalry
that iiad stretched over three
decades.
This period was marked by the
possession of the trophy by Cali
fornia from 1X1)9 until 1930. Kept
in hiding throughout each year,
it was reserved to keynote each
rally held before a Rig Game.
Cardinal attempts to recapture the
prize met with failure until 1930.
when Sequoia's immortal twenty
one successfully brought the Axe
back to the Farm.
The Stanford Axe was born on
April 13, 1899. This great tomahawk,
boasting a 15-inch blade, keynoted
one of the biggest rally's ever held
on the Farm, held Stanford students
in fascination as undergraduate
leaders used the blade as a precious
symbol of victory.
Dull, and not an effective weapon,
! the Axe was sharpened on an enor
mous grindstone before the eyes of a
delighted student body.
Then it. was tested upon the neck
of a Blue and Gold effigy. With one
stroke, the now-keen blade severed
the dummy's head cleanly from the
i body, the signal for a vociferous ser
-1 pentine dance about the bonfire and
! the Axe that lasted far into the
night.
Two days later the Farm bowed
j to a superb California team. But a
stunned student-body forgot the
| defeat when it found that it had lost
the Axe.
Overpowering four Stanford
j guards, an estimated crowd of 300
| California rooters seized the symbol
and made their triumphant way
j back to Berkeley . . . thus starting
one of the most heralded collegiate
I leuds in history.
The list of Stanford attempts to
j regain the trophy began that same
' night. At a wild, impromptu Cali

possession of the trophy by Cali
fornia from 1X1)9 until 1930. Kept
in hiding throughout each year,
it was reserved to keynote each
rally held before a Rig Game.
Cardinal attempts to recapture the
prize met with failure until 1930.
when Sequoia's immortal twenty
one successfully brought the Axe
back to the Farm.
The Stanford Axe was born on
April 13, 1899. This great tomahawk,
boasting a 15-inch blade, keynoted
one of the biggest rally's ever held
on the Farm, held Stanford students
in fascination as undergraduate
leaders used the blade as a precious
symbol of victory.
Dull, and not an effective weapon,
! the Axe was sharpened on an enor
mous grindstone before the eyes of a
delighted student body.
Then it. was tested upon the neck
of a Blue and Gold effigy. With one
stroke, the now-keen blade severed
the dummy's head cleanly from the
i body, the signal for a vociferous ser
-1 pentine dance about the bonfire and
! the Axe that lasted far into the
night.
Two days later the Farm bowed
j to a superb California team. But a
stunned student-body forgot the
| defeat when it found that it had lost
the Axe.
Overpowering four Stanford
j guards, an estimated crowd of 300
| California rooters seized the symbol
and made their triumphant way
j back to Berkeley . . . thus starting
one of the most heralded collegiate
I leuds in history.
The list of Stanford attempts to
j regain the trophy began that same
' night. At a wild, impromptu Cali
j fornia rally Stanford men mingled
I with the joyous students in a valiant
attempt to recapture the Axe. But
j their work came to naught.
* # *
31 years the Axe remained
the target for Stanford at
tempt after Stanford attempt to
regain their lost dignity. Innu
merable plans, timed to perfec
tion. almost succeeded in re-cap
turing the trophy, only to fail
I through hard-luck on the part of
the Cardinal rescue parties.
The California scheme of keeping
the Axe in a bank vault during

these years, taking it out only for'
the Big Game rally, seemed impreg
nable.
One of the most famous Stanford
attempts at reprisal was the Cardi
nal raid upon the time-hallowed
California Senior Fence. Located
near Berkeley's North Hall, it was
built in the shape of a gigantic
Block C. Only seniors were allowed
to sit upon this landmark, and
proudly they had carved their names
upon it and left it to posterity.
Shortly after the seizure of the
Axe, a squad of 24 Cardinal stal
warts set out for Berkeley. Dividing
into three groups, they outwitted
California defenders and success
fully transported the old fence,
piece by piece, back to the Palo Alto
campus.

Their plan failed, for California
chose to look upon the matter as a
joke. Stanford kept the fence as
hostage and finally burned it as a
jinx.
The recapture of the Axu seemed
more of an impossibility train ever.
Subsequent attempts appeared for
ever doomed.
But. an immortal band of twenty
one men made the dream of recap
ture of the Axe a realization.

April (>, 1930. California held
its customary pre-game rally,
with the Axe as the center of the
celebration. Members of the Stan
ford group were present, and
when the armored car started for

the bank with its precious cargo,
maneuvered into positions on the
running hoard of (lie car.
Ten minutes before the rally
closed, live others of the Stanford
group drove to the bank, backed
their car onto the sidewalk, and
rigged up a camera in the rumble
se.it. Other Stanford men were sta
tioned in strategic points about the
bank door.
Nervously waiting in their posi
tions, the Cardinal band greeted the
arrival of the steel-covered car
with cries of "Let's have a good shot
of the Axe!" The California guards
drew back, and as the Axe custodian
stepped from the rear of the car an
overloaded shot of flashlight powder
was released with a blinding flash.
Dropping on the shoulders of the
Axe custodian, one Stanford stal
wart wrenched the Axe from his
hands, passed it through several
hands to the camera car.

AS TIIE AXE was stowed in the
car, a tear-gas bomb was
dropped directly in front of the
bank, causing the mob of Califor
i nia students to scatter in all direc
tions.
Fifty minutes later, eluding all
i pusuit, the Stanford group brought
i the trophy back to the Stanford
campus. Pandemonium greeted its
arrival, as hundreds of students
' were wakened from their beds by
I triumphant cries of "We've got the
Axe!"
An impromptu rally was started
at Hoble . . . the first Stanford Axe
rally in 31 years. Men wept to see
the sacred trophy at last regained.

r |MIE much-fought-over trophy
retired from view for three
years, with Stanford following the
Berkeley lead and keeping it se
cure in a Palo Alto bank vault.
Today the Stanford Axe is once
' again in California hands . . . this
time as a trophy won by victory on
i the football field. Tomorrow we will
j attempt to regain it; not through the
! strategem of twenty-one men and a
tear-gas bomb . . . but through tho
I prowess of eleven men and a pig-
I skin.
1 IVE 'EM . . . the AXE!"
Through the haze ot tradition
that over-hangs the sandstone
buildings ot Stanford's Quad, none
is more sacred to Farm undergrad
uates; none more inspiring to teams
battling for the Cardinal; none that
can bring more vivid memories to
Farm graduates than the story of
the Stanford Axo.
Today, The Stanford Daily pre
sents a brief history of the symbol j
that has made so indelible a mark ;
on all who ever were associated with I
this university. For 31 years the
Stanford Axe was the lode-stone for
fistic rivalry between Stanford and
California. Since 1933 that .same Axe j
has been the trophy which marks
supremacy on the gridiron for one
of these two universities.
The hatchet has been buried . . .
but not the Axe.

\Y HEN, in 1933, the Axe was of

the Stanford - California yearly
gridiron classic, it marked the end
