# Fight to Win
## 
### 
JUST before 2 o'clock tomorrow afternoon 36
men in red and silver will run out onto the
Stadium turf. And while they are warming up
and kicking and passing the ball around, some
of them may glance up at the Stanford rooting
section.
For a minute they may wonder what the
men and women sitting there are thinking.
They will be self-conscious for a reason.
It is impossible to lose six football games in
a season without asking oneself whether the
team is losing the respect and support of the
rest of the student body.
Tomorrow the gridman can forget thisfdoubt.
Just as he does, the rest of Stanford wants to
win this game 10 times more than any other.
Something more than blaring songs and fervid
cheers will indicate this spirit; the air will be
charged with it.
Forty-five years of rivalry, a life-long inter
est for every follower of Pacific Coast football,
and the promise of the return of the Axe stand
behind tomorrow's Big Game. The teams are
evenly matched—and Stanford senses victory.
The spark for this flame of confidence began
to burn at last night's rally, it flares on today,
and tomorrow it will become a roaring con
flagration.
After three long years, after a season which
to date lacks a single victory, the time has
come.
Stanford stands solidly behind the team.
And the team is ready for victory.
