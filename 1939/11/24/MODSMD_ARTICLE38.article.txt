# Something to Yell About
## 
### 
MORE than one contest will be fought in
the Stanford Stadium tomorrow.
While the boys in red jerseys are battling on
the gridiron, the men in white shirts will be
waging a war of their own in the stands.
Having carefully rehearsed it at their rally
last Wednesday night, the Cal rooters will
give the Axe Yell—and the Stanford rooters
will see red. Four thousand Indians will shat
ter their lungs to drown out 10,000 Bears.
Undoubtedly the men from Berkeley will
shout, "But not for me," at the appropriate point
whenever "Come Join the Band" is sung, and
they are sure to give Tiny Thornhill a rough
ride. But there, we hope, the fun is going to
stop.
Earlier this season California's President
Robert Gordon Sproul had occasion to state,
"The thoughtlessness of the rooting section is
creating a reputation for the University which,
if every member would only think about it, he
would regret as much as I."
Ten thousand rooters are hard to control.
Stanford's yell leader has an easier job with
4,000.
To date, the Cardinal section always has dis
played a rousing spirit, even in the face of a
33-0 defeat. And it never has given the outside
public any cause for criticism.
And so it will be tomorrow.
Songs and yells will be louder and more
frequent because it is the Big Game.
But Stanford will be yelling to run up its
score—not to run down Cal.
