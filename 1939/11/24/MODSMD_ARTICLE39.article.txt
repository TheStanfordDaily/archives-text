YOU have heard and read a lot of words
about how this is Big Game week, and
we've got to bring to Axe back home, and the
Gaieties are swell, and the jolly-up this after
noon is going to be swell, and the bonfire last
night was terrific.
And you are Stanford men and women; so
you didn't believe it. You are too self-con
scious to believe it. You don't like to believe.
That does not pertain alone to Big Game
week.
But this does: let's put the cards on the
table and say it the way it is. This is Big
Game week, and it's a hell of a good week.
Tomorrow is the climax. You may go into
that Stadium cold, but you can't stay that
way, not when you are there watching a team
from Stanford play a team from California.
And you will want to go out tomorrow night
and have a good time.
Now, you are saying, we come to the propa
ganda part. The Daily is diving its daily plug
for the Big Game dance.
Why? Because a representative of Stan

ford students worked out a way Stanford could
go out Big Game night and have a good time.
The Daily is trying to show them they can
have a good time.
Above all the other things which have been
said about the dance at the Millbrae Country
Club, it will be good because what happens
will be spontaneous.
They won't have to try to have a good time.
They can go to the dance and let the good
time come to them. â€”D. J.
