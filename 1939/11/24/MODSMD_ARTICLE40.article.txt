ON TIIE OLI) CAMPANILE
I )EAR CAL ROOTING SECTION:
Do you suppose it would tax your imagination too
much to think up and use yells of your own?
Pessimistically yours,
One of Your Stanford Friends
P.S.: It's not a really world-shaking issue, com
pared with the World War or the Rosevell third term.
It's not the sort of thing one likes to get ired about.
But we are just wondering where this business of
stealing the Axe Yell is going to lead.
Years ago, before the advent of Cal-Stanford peace
pacts, some of your more high-spirited brigands stole
the sacred Stanford Axe. The mighty and crafty Se
quoia roughs recaptured the Indian symbol with phony
newspaper cameras and tear gas. And a few years
ago we thought the Axe rivalry had been raised to the
plane of sportsmanship when the sought-after hatchet
was made the prize for Big Game victroy.
But we were overly optimistic. With no more in
centive to steal the Axe itself, you have now gone on
to more spiritual types of pilfering. You have now
stolen the Axe Yell.
* <t * *
1 [NFORTUNATELY Sequoia men can not .steal the
Axe Yell back. Some have suggested that the
Stanford rooting section start using "Grr-r-r-rah!" or
some other Cal yell. The obvious disadvantage to that
procedure is that we would be getting the short end
of the exchange-robbery.
But an even stronger argument is that we would
prefer not to drag the Big Game rivalry down to com
petitive yell-stealing. We may be old-fashioned, but
we rather like the game of football, in preference to
"Guess who's yell we've got," "Button, button; who's
got the button," or "Drop the handkerchief."
It is, however, a stimulating occupation to wonder
what the next move in this one-sided game will be.
Maybe you would like to get some new words to
"Come Join the Band" and use that, too. I imagine you
have some relatively original chaps in your poetry
classes who could think of the words, once given the
tune and arrangement. Or if that is too much trouble
perhaps you could just hum the song—spiritedly, of
course.
But I guess it would really be easier for you to just
come down here for the next Pre-Reg Program, leant
all about Stanford traditions, and then just carry out
a mass-copying program. The freshman bible will
serve as a good reference book.
Thank Heaven and Bethlehem Steel that the Hoover
War Libe is firmly cemented into the ground, or before
long you would have that, too —right on top of the old
Campanile.

Pessimistically yours,
One of Your Stanford Friends
P.S.: It's not a really world-shaking issue, com
pared with the World War or the Rosevell third term.
It's not the sort of thing one likes to get ired about.
But we are just wondering where this business of
stealing the Axe Yell is going to lead.
Years ago, before the advent of Cal-Stanford peace
pacts, some of your more high-spirited brigands stole
the sacred Stanford Axe. The mighty and crafty Se
quoia roughs recaptured the Indian symbol with phony
newspaper cameras and tear gas. And a few years
ago we thought the Axe rivalry had been raised to the
plane of sportsmanship when the sought-after hatchet
was made the prize for Big Game victroy.
But we were overly optimistic. With no more in
centive to steal the Axe itself, you have now gone on
to more spiritual types of pilfering. You have now
stolen the Axe Yell.

1 [NFORTUNATELY Sequoia men can not .steal the
Axe Yell back. Some have suggested that the
Stanford rooting section start using "Grr-r-r-rah!" or
some other Cal yell. The obvious disadvantage to that
procedure is that we would be getting the short end
of the exchange-robbery.
But an even stronger argument is that we would
prefer not to drag the Big Game rivalry down to com
petitive yell-stealing. We may be old-fashioned, but
we rather like the game of football, in preference to
"Guess who's yell we've got," "Button, button; who's
got the button," or "Drop the handkerchief."
It is, however, a stimulating occupation to wonder
what the next move in this one-sided game will be.
Maybe you would like to get some new words to
"Come Join the Band" and use that, too. I imagine you
have some relatively original chaps in your poetry
classes who could think of the words, once given the
tune and arrangement. Or if that is too much trouble
perhaps you could just hum the song—spiritedly, of
course.
But I guess it would really be easier for you to just
come down here for the next Pre-Reg Program, leant
all about Stanford traditions, and then just carry out
a mass-copying program. The freshman bible will
serve as a good reference book.
Thank Heaven and Bethlehem Steel that the Hoover
War Libe is firmly cemented into the ground, or before
long you would have that, too —right on top of the old
Campanile.
ON TIIE OLI) CAMPANILE
I )EAR CAL ROOTING SECTION:
Do you suppose it would tax your imagination too
much to think up and use yells of your own?
