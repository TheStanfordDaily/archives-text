# CAMPUS OPINION
## THE 						MICE SQUEAK UP 
### 
r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
So student government exists at Stanford? That's
really one for the books! When a group of students
supposedly representing the various fraternities gather
together as a unit and tries its very best to push those
organizations off of the campus, there must be the pro
verbial "nigger in the wood-pile."
How this group can so obviously voice the admin
istration's views on the fraternity set-up and still
maintain that those ideas are its own is beyond me.
These men, supposedly working for the betterment of
the various houses, do their level best to run the entire
fraternity organization off the campus, which is a se
rious thing. Everything to date done by the Council
can be traced to the Administration's unspoken views
on the situation.
* $ 3|: X.
bother with a Council that is so weak-kneed
" and yellow as to cater and crawl, when it would
be so much cheaper and so far superior to let the
Administration run the entire thing and allow the
fraternities to sit back and accept what is thrown at
them? It is obvious that the heads of the Council, as
shown by their attitudes and behaviors are literally
and actually kissing the ground the administration
walks on.
When this is true, and it must be so, why not do
the wise thing and do away with the council. As it is
now, it is only a mouthpiece for the administration and
not for the houses.
Of course there are some houses here on the cam
pus that are so spineless that they will vote on any
thing to remain in the good graces of the Admin
istration. It may be a good idea, but in this action they
speed their own destruction as well as the destruc
tion of all concerned.
Signed,
One of the men "Of Mice and Men"
