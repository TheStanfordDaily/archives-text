# THROUGH HELL FOR HORTENSE
## 
### 
r FHE EDITOR, SlR—and Hortense:
I agree with you that Hell Week and all that it
entails can't possibly be dispelled with a wave of the
hand. It takes more than that, it takes Rood common
sense and the united action of most of the modern
thinking students. (You do think, don't you, Hortense?)
The "Enlightened Paradise" wherein one bunch of
fellows mops up on a smaller bunch is very enlighten
ing indeed. It displays the good old German-vcrsus-
Polc spirit which ceases to be just a healthy tradition
when it becomes an actuality.
I just wonder if you've ever had your posterior
paddled until it felt like a bonfire in Hades, or if
you've ever been the recipient of the "red-belly" (sci
entifically administered), or been left naked thirty-odd
miles up in the hills with nothing but a pint of Scotch?
(You haven't, have you, Hortense?)
* * * *
YV/'HEN you mentioned our young Stanford ladies
and the fact, that some of them are inclined to
back "Hell Week" tradition it rather reminded me of
the well-groomed dandy who, upon watching a con
struction gang for some time, at length remarks to a
fellow loiterer, "Work fascinates me."
Just one more thing. Hortense, before I get to the
point of this letter. Speaking of the 1928-29 college
hey-day, it is always easy to whip up a lot of rustic
spirit with two or three snorts under your belt, but I
understand that went out of style some time ago.
Now to the point, Horty ... I couldn't get up
enough nerve to say this to your face (who could?)
but how about a date for "Drums Along the Mohawk"?
No fooling? Hot dog!! !
Affectionately,
Gussie
