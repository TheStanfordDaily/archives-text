## 
### 
"DRUMS ALONG HIE MOHAWK," now playing at the Stanford Theater.
Magnificent but not melodramatic. Superbly colorful but not gaudy
Romantic hut not sticky.
A boost for the integrity of these United States, litis exciting frontier
film is a bright star in a long galaxy of "Indian versus Yankee" dramas.
Rich, realistic technicolor plus the convincing acting of Claudette Colbert,

Henry Fonda, and an excellent sup-,
porting cast combine to make this a
Thanksgiving treat with a Fourth of
July angle.
FILMED IN UTAH
A story of the days when there
were Whigs and Tories instead of
Democrats and Republicans—and the
Indians were the Communists, the
drama quickened the pulses of the
audience with its tale of the trials
and tribulations of the Revolutionary
War. Laid in the Mohawk Valley
(but filmed in Utah, and inciden
tally you'd never know it), it tells
the story of the terror of the fron
tier before Cornwallis surrendered
to Washington.
Gil Martin (Henry Fonda) brings
his cake-fed wife, Lena (Claudette
Colbert), to their little log shack in
the Middle West and immediately
she is conditioned to tomahawks and
terror when the Indians, spurred on
by the British, attack the tiny set
tlement.
After the Martins' home is burned,
they are taken as hired help by a
war widow, Edna May Oliver, who
is her usual comical, brusque self.
THE PLOT THICKENS
The Mohawk Valley Americans
are then recruited and Gil barely
returns home from battle alive. Fi
nally the critical attack comes, and
when all ammunition is gone, Mar
tin runs for relief. The Yankees
march in, save the fort, and the au
dience cheers.
The film is well worth seeing just
for the gorgeous technicolor and the
collection of excellent stills. Prob
ably the best shots are of Henry
Fonda running for help and being
chased by three redskins. The sil
houettes of the four men are taken
against a glowing red sunset.—Steele
