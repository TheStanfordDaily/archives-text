# Farm to Hear Sayao Monday
## 
### 
Although Bidu Sayao has been fly
ing back and forth between coasts
all fall to meet opera engagements
here and in the East, she will have
to stay put once the Metropolitan
season opens, and her concert in
Memorial Hall Monday night marks
her final appearance on this end of
the route.
The Concert Series usually pre
sents two concerts during winter
quarter, but the young soprano
from Brazil this year shares the fall
quarter spotlight with the Don Cos
sacks, who opened the 1939-40 sea
son.
During winter quarter the Farm
will hear Lawrence Tibbett, and in
the final concert next spring the
San Francisco Symphony will play,
with Pierre Monteux conducting
and Isaac Stern, violinist, as guest
soloist.
Bidu Sayao's concert Monday
night will include two selections
from Massenet's "Manon,'' in which
she sang in San Francisco and Los
Angeles this fall.
Following two years of study in
Nice with the late Jean de Reszke,
Miss Sayao made her operatic de
but in Rio de Janeiro as Rosina in
"The Barber of Seville." She made
her American debut in Debussy'
"Blessed Demoiselle," accompanied
by the New York Philharmonic.
The largest primitive area in the
United States is in Southeastern
Utah a region almost without trails
and cut by deep canyons.
