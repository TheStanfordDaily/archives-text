ST. LOUIS, Nov. 23 (UP).â€”A se
vere earth tremor centering at Fes
tus, Mo., 30 miles south of here, to
day rocked a four-state area, caus
ing considerable alarm but only
minor damage.
Rev. James B. Macelwane, head
of the Department of Geophysics at
St. Louis University, said the shock,
so intense that one of the univer
sity's seismograph needles was
knocked off its hinges, lasted 30
seconds and was followed by lesser
tremors lasting about 15 minutes.
The longest run from a kick-off
in a Coast Conference game was
made by Milt Popovich of Montana.
Taking the ball two yards from be
hind the goal line, he ran the full
length of the field to a touchdown.
