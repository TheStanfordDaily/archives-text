—To settle finally the worth of El
l sie's knees, Mayor R. W. Miller

come to Bartlett and lift the hem
of her dress with "the prettiest girls
in Texas."
Miller offered to pay Elsie's round
trip transportation by airplane and
i all of her expenses if she would
push her knees beneath a banquet
I table while the city fathers toasted
"dimpled knees that. God put on
1 women for men to appreciate."
Miller said it would be a shame
for Elsie to return from her Holly
wood holiday to the cold Nevada
winter and bundle up her knees un
! til spring time.
