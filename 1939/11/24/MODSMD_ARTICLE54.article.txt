# Indians, Bears to Battle For League Cellar Title In Historic Grudge Fight
## Injuries Cost Each Team key Men; Cal Lacks Backfield Threat, Cards Will Have to Tighten Up Line Play 
### STAN COHN 
Spurts Kditor, The I>ail.\ California!!
Two of the nation's oldest rivals. California and Stanford, who a few
years hack battled furiously for first prize, the Kom Bowl bid. will be fight
ing Saturday for a prize which neither wants, a booby prize, the confer
ence doormat.
Hie Boars and the Cards, residing in seventh and eighth places respec
tively in the F.C.C.. seem to he racing toward oblivion. This year has

spelled disaster foi both schools on 4
the gridiron. But season records,
games won and lost, yardage accu- j
mulated, Pi > t downs made—all this
goes into the garbage can with the i
rest of the used material as tradition
makes its annual bow.
Tradition is.1 powerful worker.
Age of the two schools, history on
the football field, possession of the I
Axe, the 45th annual meeting -these J
form the foundation on which tradi
tion is built. These, combined with
the unpredictable air which .sur
rounds every meeting of the two
institutions, form the "Big Game."
This year more than ever should
find the game a thriller. This year
finds the two elevens evenly matched
for the first time since Vj'.)2 when
the tilt ended in a scoreless tie. Thi
year finds both .squads riddled with
injuries. Both hove lost key men, but
in different ways. The Bears find
themselves shy on backfield talent
with the loss of Fred Anderson,
Louie Smith, and Ted Hubert. Smith
and Hubert may bo available for
the contest, but can't possibly be
in shape. Andersen never had a
chance.
Stanford's injuries lie in both the
line and the backfield with the loss
of Jim Groves, Gene Coldiron, Corky
Donahue, and Bill Willard.
California so far has been dis
tinctly a first half team. In the open
ing quarters the Bears have played
even with the toughest of their op
ponents. But with the opening kick
off of the second half, the team seems
to take on a defeatist complex and
folds miserably.
A lack of offensive power has
halted almost every touchdown
drive. The one thing that Cal seems
to lack is a threat in the backfield.
Each tailback excels in only one de
partment of the game. When Firpo
plays we have a passing attack.
When Perry is in the left half slot
our ground attack is the best bet.
With one good back to combine these
two talents the Bears could really
roll.
The California line is as good as
any on the Coast. But a lack of
backfield material makes the line
useless. The possible return of Smith
and Hubert should raise the chances
of the Blue and Gold. Smith's kick
ing ability plus his running to the
weak side should give the Bears
more variation on the ground. Be
ing one of the best pass receivers in
captivity he may make the Cal aerial
attack work.
Hubert, in the few games which
he has played, has shown the ability
which was predicted of him when a
frosh. He has developed into a bet
ter-than-average blocker, and his
plunging gives Cal plenty of steam
through the middle. In addition he
seems to be the team's spark plug.
It's senseless to try to weigh one
team's chances against the other in
a Big Game. Even Houdini couldn't
tell you how it will end. At the
present time Cal is a slight favor
ite. Whether or not they deserve
the top spot is open to dispute.

Hie Boars and the Cards, residing in seventh and eighth places respec
tively in the F.C.C.. seem to he racing toward oblivion. This year has

spelled disaster foi both schools on 4
the gridiron. But season records,
games won and lost, yardage accu- j
mulated, Pi > t downs made—all this
goes into the garbage can with the i
rest of the used material as tradition
makes its annual bow.
Tradition is.1 powerful worker.
Age of the two schools, history on
the football field, possession of the I
Axe, the 45th annual meeting -these J
form the foundation on which tradi
tion is built. These, combined with
the unpredictable air which .sur
rounds every meeting of the two
institutions, form the "Big Game."
This year more than ever should
find the game a thriller. This year
finds the two elevens evenly matched
for the first time since Vj'.)2 when
the tilt ended in a scoreless tie. Thi
year finds both .squads riddled with
injuries. Both hove lost key men, but
in different ways. The Bears find
themselves shy on backfield talent
with the loss of Fred Anderson,
Louie Smith, and Ted Hubert. Smith
and Hubert may bo available for
the contest, but can't possibly be
in shape. Andersen never had a
chance.
Stanford's injuries lie in both the
line and the backfield with the loss
of Jim Groves, Gene Coldiron, Corky
Donahue, and Bill Willard.
California so far has been dis
tinctly a first half team. In the open
ing quarters the Bears have played
even with the toughest of their op
ponents. But with the opening kick
off of the second half, the team seems
to take on a defeatist complex and
folds miserably.
A lack of offensive power has
halted almost every touchdown
drive. The one thing that Cal seems
to lack is a threat in the backfield.
Each tailback excels in only one de
partment of the game. When Firpo
plays we have a passing attack.
When Perry is in the left half slot
our ground attack is the best bet.
With one good back to combine these
two talents the Bears could really
roll.
The California line is as good as
any on the Coast. But a lack of
backfield material makes the line
useless. The possible return of Smith
and Hubert should raise the chances
of the Blue and Gold. Smith's kick
ing ability plus his running to the
weak side should give the Bears
more variation on the ground. Be
ing one of the best pass receivers in
captivity he may make the Cal aerial
attack work.
Hubert, in the few games which
he has played, has shown the ability
which was predicted of him when a
frosh. He has developed into a bet
ter-than-average blocker, and his
plunging gives Cal plenty of steam
through the middle. In addition he
seems to be the team's spark plug.
It's senseless to try to weigh one
team's chances against the other in
a Big Game. Even Houdini couldn't
tell you how it will end. At the
present time Cal is a slight favor
ite. Whether or not they deserve
the top spot is open to dispute.
