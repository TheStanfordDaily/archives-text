### JERRY MAYER 
TWO TEAMS WON'T
LINE I P ON CRUTCHES
Two teams wlu> have had their
chances lor successful seasons ab
solutely Hiined by injuries limp
onto the Stanford Stadium turf to
morrow f?r the 45th renewal of the
classic Big Game series.
Take S anford, for instance. While
warming up just before the kickofT
of the seison-opening game against
Oregon State, Bill Willaid, alter
nate left end, strained the ligaments
in his lej| so badly that he was put
out of commission for the season.
That left only an inexperienced Bill
i Greer Ichind first-stringer Stan
i Graff.
Cone i Tiny Thornhill still had
two ex jerienrcd regular fiaukinen
in And / Stojkovich and Graff, with
I red Meyer, a sophomore, and
Greer playing behind them. Then
almos' simultaneously Greer and
Meyc turned up with injuries,
and liny found himself in one
game with only three ends on the
entire squad.

It seemed like a great move at the
i time when Tiny moved Ilamp Pool
! to the back field and Johnny Kerman
into the left guard position. Kerman
played brilliantly in the U.C.L.A.
i game, and just when great things
| were expected of him he turnel up
I with an injured leg that put him out
for the season.
At the same time when Kerman
was moved to the first string, light
guard Corky Donahue was shifted
to right tackle. But Corky was so
badly cracked up in the Santa Clara
game that he wasn't even able to
suit up for the U.S.C. end Washing
ton State games, and won't be at top

shape even if he does play tomorrow.
In tlie hackfield. Thor Peterson
wrecked his hack in practice right
after he had shown great promise
in the U.C.L.A. game as a relief
for Norm Standlee. His injury
kept Peterson out of action for
three games, forcing Standlee to
play almost (JO minutes of every
game.
Adding misery to misery, Gene
Coldiron turned in a brilliant line
backing game against U.S.C.. but
was carried off the field in the sec
ond half. Coldiron sat on the bench
during the Washington State game
and will be in far from good condi
tion against California.
As if all this wasn't enough, Jim
Groves decided to give up the sport
after the U.S.C. contest because of a
badly injured shoulder that had
been bothering him all season.
Of course, Cal can claim her
share of losses, too. First there
was Louis Smith, the lanky right
half who was being boomed for
All-American honors hut went out
with water on the knee. Smith,
who was the best kicker, passer,
blocker, and hall-carrier on the
Bear squad at the start of the sea
son. is expected to play tomor
row. hut it is almost impossible to
expect very much from him. what
with an almost seven-week lay
off.

Dave Queen, Couch Stub Alli
son's plucky lfi6-pound center, broke
his foot in practice before the sea
son started. Ted Hubert, fullback,
will play tomorrow but injuries cost
the Bears his services during the
