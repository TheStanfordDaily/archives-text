### JERRY MAYER 
TWO TEAMS WON'T
LINE I P ON CRUTCHES
Two teams wlu> have had their
chances lor successful seasons ab
solutely Hiined by injuries limp
onto the Stanford Stadium turf to
morrow f?r the 45th renewal of the
classic Big Game series.
Take S anford, for instance. While
warming up just before the kickofT
of the seison-opening game against
Oregon State, Bill Willaid, alter
nate left end, strained the ligaments
in his lej| so badly that he was put
out of commission for the season.
That left only an inexperienced Bill
i Greer Ichind first-stringer Stan
i Graff.
Cone i Tiny Thornhill still had
two ex jerienrcd regular fiaukinen
in And / Stojkovich and Graff, with
I red Meyer, a sophomore, and
Greer playing behind them. Then
almos' simultaneously Greer and
Meyc turned up with injuries,
and liny found himself in one
game with only three ends on the
entire squad.
# ❖ #
It seemed like a great move at the
i time when Tiny moved Ilamp Pool
! to the back field and Johnny Kerman
into the left guard position. Kerman
played brilliantly in the U.C.L.A.
i game, and just when great things
| were expected of him he turnel up
I with an injured leg that put him out
for the season.
At the same time when Kerman
was moved to the first string, light
guard Corky Donahue was shifted
to right tackle. But Corky was so
badly cracked up in the Santa Clara
game that he wasn't even able to
suit up for the U.S.C. end Washing
ton State games, and won't be at top

shape even if he does play tomorrow.
In tlie hackfield. Thor Peterson
wrecked his hack in practice right
after he had shown great promise
in the U.C.L.A. game as a relief
for Norm Standlee. His injury
kept Peterson out of action for
three games, forcing Standlee to
play almost (JO minutes of every
game.
Adding misery to misery, Gene
Coldiron turned in a brilliant line
backing game against U.S.C.. but
was carried off the field in the sec
ond half. Coldiron sat on the bench
during the Washington State game
and will be in far from good condi
tion against California.
As if all this wasn't enough, Jim
Groves decided to give up the sport
after the U.S.C. contest because of a
badly injured shoulder that had
been bothering him all season.
Of course, Cal can claim her
share of losses, too. First there
was Louis Smith, the lanky right
half who was being boomed for
All-American honors hut went out
with water on the knee. Smith,
who was the best kicker, passer,
blocker, and hall-carrier on the
Bear squad at the start of the sea
son. is expected to play tomor
row. hut it is almost impossible to
expect very much from him. what
with an almost seven-week lay
off.
* # *
Dave Queen, Couch Stub Alli
son's plucky lfi6-pound center, broke
his foot in practice before the sea
son started. Ted Hubert, fullback,
will play tomorrow but injuries cost
the Bears his services during the
greater part of the season. There
were others, but these arc the most
important.
So. tomorrow is tht game between
the "might-have-beens."
Somewhere along about 5 o'clock
i we'll know what team might have
been the greatest this year.
TEN CAKD GRIDDERS
MEET CAE LAST TIME
Ten Stanford gridders get their
last chance to tomahawk the Bears
tomorrow. Not one of them has
tasted victory over California.
These are the men who close their
Big Game careers tomorrow:
STAN ANDERSEN, left tackle.
Andersen luts played some great
football in his three years manning
the tackle positions—and some very
. mediocre ball. But when the team
elected him captain just before the
U.S.C. game, a change was wrought
in the big Norwegian. He is playing
with a purpose now, which makes
him perhaps the finest tackle on the
, coast.
GENE COLDIKON, quarterback.
For three years Coldiron has done
nothing but reflect credit on Stan
i ford. Activity man, he has mixed
I well. And while he has not been a
brilliant performer on the football
field, he was always a sincere one
who played to the top of his poten
tialities.
HAMPTON POOL, left guard. Af
ter transferring from California to
West Point and finally to Stanford,
the giant Pool turned from a fair
backfield man to an outstanding
guard. He played wonderfully
against Cal last year; there is no
! reason why he shouldn't be great
tomorrow.
<1 *
ANDY STOJKOVICIL right end.
The Stoker worked his way up from
! the ranks to become a regular,
i While he is not perhaps a natural
player, he is tops in a pinch and he's
got the will-to-win spirit that ihakes
for long-remembered Big Game per
formances.
i CORKY DONAHUE, right tackle.
Whether Corky will play or not is
still doubtful due to his injured leg,
| but if he does see action, he'll put
, guts and lots of drive into his play.
He always does.
BILL GREER, left end. This is
Greer's first year of action after sit
ting on the bench during the 1938
season. His inexperience handi
capped him, but not nearly as much
as his determination to succeed aided
I him.
$ *
STEVE KEUSSEFF, left guard.
There may be better offensive block
ers than Keusseff, but when he's
right, they don't come much better
' on defense.
I JOHN McDONOUGH, right tackle.
; McDonough got his chance when
Donahue was injured, and he came
! through. A fighter who took ad
vantage of his opportunity.
JACK (MOON) MULIJN, left half.
Jack stepped into the varsity left
half post and added the steadiness
that his two sophomore alternates
lacked. Mullin is a splended bullet
' passer.
JIM GROVES, right 1 iiilf. Groves
won't get into tomorrow's game, hav
ing turned in hir. suit a couple oi
weeks ago because of a shoulder in
jury. Groves might have been un
outstanding back if injuries hadn't
dogged him throughout his college
! career.

TWO TEAMS WON'T
LINE I P ON CRUTCHES
Two teams wlu> have had their
chances lor successful seasons ab
solutely Hiined by injuries limp
onto the Stanford Stadium turf to
morrow f?r the 45th renewal of the
classic Big Game series.
Take S anford, for instance. While
warming up just before the kickofT
of the seison-opening game against
Oregon State, Bill Willaid, alter
nate left end, strained the ligaments
in his lej| so badly that he was put
out of commission for the season.
That left only an inexperienced Bill
i Greer Ichind first-stringer Stan
i Graff.
Cone i Tiny Thornhill still had
two ex jerienrcd regular fiaukinen
in And / Stojkovich and Graff, with
I red Meyer, a sophomore, and
Greer playing behind them. Then
almos' simultaneously Greer and
Meyc turned up with injuries,
and liny found himself in one
game with only three ends on the
entire squad.
# ❖ #
It seemed like a great move at the
i time when Tiny moved Ilamp Pool
! to the back field and Johnny Kerman
into the left guard position. Kerman
played brilliantly in the U.C.L.A.
i game, and just when great things
| were expected of him he turnel up
I with an injured leg that put him out
for the season.
At the same time when Kerman
was moved to the first string, light
guard Corky Donahue was shifted
to right tackle. But Corky was so
badly cracked up in the Santa Clara
game that he wasn't even able to
suit up for the U.S.C. end Washing
ton State games, and won't be at top

shape even if he does play tomorrow.
In tlie hackfield. Thor Peterson
wrecked his hack in practice right
after he had shown great promise
in the U.C.L.A. game as a relief
for Norm Standlee. His injury
kept Peterson out of action for
three games, forcing Standlee to
play almost (JO minutes of every
game.
Adding misery to misery, Gene
Coldiron turned in a brilliant line
backing game against U.S.C.. but
was carried off the field in the sec
ond half. Coldiron sat on the bench
during the Washington State game
and will be in far from good condi
tion against California.
As if all this wasn't enough, Jim
Groves decided to give up the sport
after the U.S.C. contest because of a
badly injured shoulder that had
been bothering him all season.
Of course, Cal can claim her
share of losses, too. First there
was Louis Smith, the lanky right
half who was being boomed for
All-American honors hut went out
with water on the knee. Smith,
who was the best kicker, passer,
blocker, and hall-carrier on the
Bear squad at the start of the sea
son. is expected to play tomor
row. hut it is almost impossible to
expect very much from him. what
with an almost seven-week lay
off.
* # *
Dave Queen, Couch Stub Alli
son's plucky lfi6-pound center, broke
his foot in practice before the sea
son started. Ted Hubert, fullback,
will play tomorrow but injuries cost
the Bears his services during the
greater part of the season. There
were others, but these arc the most
important.
So. tomorrow is tht game between
the "might-have-beens."
Somewhere along about 5 o'clock
i we'll know what team might have
been the greatest this year.
TEN CAKD GRIDDERS
MEET CAE LAST TIME
Ten Stanford gridders get their
last chance to tomahawk the Bears
tomorrow. Not one of them has
tasted victory over California.
These are the men who close their
Big Game careers tomorrow:
STAN ANDERSEN, left tackle.
Andersen luts played some great
football in his three years manning
the tackle positions—and some very
. mediocre ball. But when the team
elected him captain just before the
U.S.C. game, a change was wrought
in the big Norwegian. He is playing
with a purpose now, which makes
him perhaps the finest tackle on the
, coast.
GENE COLDIKON, quarterback.
For three years Coldiron has done
nothing but reflect credit on Stan
i ford. Activity man, he has mixed
I well. And while he has not been a
brilliant performer on the football
field, he was always a sincere one
who played to the top of his poten
tialities.
HAMPTON POOL, left guard. Af
ter transferring from California to
West Point and finally to Stanford,
the giant Pool turned from a fair
backfield man to an outstanding
guard. He played wonderfully
against Cal last year; there is no
! reason why he shouldn't be great
tomorrow.
<1 *
ANDY STOJKOVICIL right end.
The Stoker worked his way up from
! the ranks to become a regular,
i While he is not perhaps a natural
player, he is tops in a pinch and he's
got the will-to-win spirit that ihakes
for long-remembered Big Game per
formances.
i CORKY DONAHUE, right tackle.
Whether Corky will play or not is
still doubtful due to his injured leg,
| but if he does see action, he'll put
, guts and lots of drive into his play.
He always does.

him perhaps the finest tackle on the

GENE COLDIKON, quarterback.
For three years Coldiron has done
nothing but reflect credit on Stan
i ford. Activity man, he has mixed
I well. And while he has not been a
brilliant performer on the football
field, he was always a sincere one
who played to the top of his poten
tialities.
HAMPTON POOL, left guard. Af
ter transferring from California to
West Point and finally to Stanford,
the giant Pool turned from a fair
backfield man to an outstanding
guard. He played wonderfully
against Cal last year; there is no

tomorrow.

ANDY STOJKOVICIL right end.
The Stoker worked his way up from

player, he is tops in a pinch and he's
got the will-to-win spirit that ihakes
for long-remembered Big Game per
formances.
i CORKY DONAHUE, right tackle.
Whether Corky will play or not is
still doubtful due to his injured leg,

, guts and lots of drive into his play.
He always does.
BILL GREER, left end. This is
Greer's first year of action after sit
ting on the bench during the 1938
season. His inexperience handi
capped him, but not nearly as much
as his determination to succeed aided
I him.

right, they don't come much better
' on defense.

Donahue was injured, and he came

vantage of his opportunity.
JACK (MOON) MULIJN, left half.
Jack stepped into the varsity left
half post and added the steadiness
that his two sophomore alternates
lacked. Mullin is a splended bullet
' passer.
JIM GROVES, right 1 iiilf. Groves
won't get into tomorrow's game, hav

TWO TEAMS WON'T
LINE I P ON CRUTCHES
Two teams wlu> have had their
chances lor successful seasons ab
solutely Hiined by injuries limp
onto the Stanford Stadium turf to
morrow f?r the 45th renewal of the
classic Big Game series.
Take S anford, for instance. While
warming up just before the kickofT
of the seison-opening game against
Oregon State, Bill Willaid, alter
nate left end, strained the ligaments
in his lej| so badly that he was put
out of commission for the season.
That left only an inexperienced Bill
i Greer Ichind first-stringer Stan
i Graff.
Cone i Tiny Thornhill still had
two ex jerienrcd regular fiaukinen
in And / Stojkovich and Graff, with
I red Meyer, a sophomore, and
Greer playing behind them. Then
almos' simultaneously Greer and
Meyc turned up with injuries,
and liny found himself in one
game with only three ends on the
entire squad.
# ❖ #
It seemed like a great move at the
i time when Tiny moved Ilamp Pool
! to the back field and Johnny Kerman
into the left guard position. Kerman
played brilliantly in the U.C.L.A.
i game, and just when great things
| were expected of him he turnel up
I with an injured leg that put him out
for the season.
At the same time when Kerman
was moved to the first string, light
guard Corky Donahue was shifted
to right tackle. But Corky was so
badly cracked up in the Santa Clara
game that he wasn't even able to
suit up for the U.S.C. end Washing
ton State games, and won't be at top

shape even if he does play tomorrow.
In tlie hackfield. Thor Peterson
wrecked his hack in practice right
after he had shown great promise
in the U.C.L.A. game as a relief
for Norm Standlee. His injury
kept Peterson out of action for
three games, forcing Standlee to
play almost (JO minutes of every
game.
Adding misery to misery, Gene
Coldiron turned in a brilliant line
backing game against U.S.C.. but
was carried off the field in the sec
ond half. Coldiron sat on the bench
during the Washington State game
and will be in far from good condi
tion against California.
As if all this wasn't enough, Jim
Groves decided to give up the sport
after the U.S.C. contest because of a
badly injured shoulder that had
been bothering him all season.
Of course, Cal can claim her
share of losses, too. First there
was Louis Smith, the lanky right
half who was being boomed for
All-American honors hut went out
with water on the knee. Smith,
who was the best kicker, passer,
blocker, and hall-carrier on the
Bear squad at the start of the sea
son. is expected to play tomor
row. hut it is almost impossible to
expect very much from him. what
with an almost seven-week lay
off.

Dave Queen, Couch Stub Alli
son's plucky lfi6-pound center, broke
his foot in practice before the sea
son started. Ted Hubert, fullback,
will play tomorrow but injuries cost
the Bears his services during the
greater part of the season. There
were others, but these arc the most
important.
So. tomorrow is tht game between
the "might-have-beens."
Somewhere along about 5 o'clock
i we'll know what team might have
been the greatest this year.
TEN CAKD GRIDDERS

Ten Stanford gridders get their
last chance to tomahawk the Bears
tomorrow. Not one of them has
tasted victory over California.
These are the men who close their
Big Game careers tomorrow:

TEN CAKD GRIDDERS
MEET CAE LAST TIME
Ten Stanford gridders get their
last chance to tomahawk the Bears
tomorrow. Not one of them has
tasted victory over California.
These are the men who close their
Big Game careers tomorrow:
STAN ANDERSEN, left tackle.
Andersen luts played some great
football in his three years manning
the tackle positions—and some very
. mediocre ball. But when the team
elected him captain just before the
U.S.C. game, a change was wrought
in the big Norwegian. He is playing
with a purpose now, which makes
him perhaps the finest tackle on the
, coast.
GENE COLDIKON, quarterback.
For three years Coldiron has done
nothing but reflect credit on Stan
i ford. Activity man, he has mixed
I well. And while he has not been a
brilliant performer on the football
field, he was always a sincere one
who played to the top of his poten
tialities.
HAMPTON POOL, left guard. Af
ter transferring from California to
West Point and finally to Stanford,
the giant Pool turned from a fair
backfield man to an outstanding
guard. He played wonderfully
against Cal last year; there is no
! reason why he shouldn't be great
tomorrow.
<1 *
ANDY STOJKOVICIL right end.
The Stoker worked his way up from
! the ranks to become a regular,
i While he is not perhaps a natural
player, he is tops in a pinch and he's
got the will-to-win spirit that ihakes
for long-remembered Big Game per
formances.
i CORKY DONAHUE, right tackle.
Whether Corky will play or not is
still doubtful due to his injured leg,
| but if he does see action, he'll put
, guts and lots of drive into his play.
He always does.
BILL GREER, left end. This is
Greer's first year of action after sit
ting on the bench during the 1938
season. His inexperience handi
capped him, but not nearly as much
as his determination to succeed aided
I him.
$ *
STEVE KEUSSEFF, left guard.
There may be better offensive block
ers than Keusseff, but when he's
right, they don't come much better
' on defense.
I JOHN McDONOUGH, right tackle.
; McDonough got his chance when
Donahue was injured, and he came
! through. A fighter who took ad
vantage of his opportunity.
JACK (MOON) MULIJN, left half.
Jack stepped into the varsity left
half post and added the steadiness
that his two sophomore alternates
lacked. Mullin is a splended bullet
' passer.
JIM GROVES, right 1 iiilf. Groves
won't get into tomorrow's game, hav
ing turned in hir. suit a couple oi
weeks ago because of a shoulder in
jury. Groves might have been un
outstanding back if injuries hadn't
dogged him throughout his college
! career.
TWO TEAMS WON'T
LINE I P ON CRUTCHES
Two teams wlu> have had their
chances lor successful seasons ab
solutely Hiined by injuries limp
onto the Stanford Stadium turf to
morrow f?r the 45th renewal of the
classic Big Game series.
Take S anford, for instance. While
warming up just before the kickofT
of the seison-opening game against
Oregon State, Bill Willaid, alter
nate left end, strained the ligaments
in his lej| so badly that he was put
out of commission for the season.
That left only an inexperienced Bill
i Greer Ichind first-stringer Stan
i Graff.
Cone i Tiny Thornhill still had
two ex jerienrcd regular fiaukinen
in And / Stojkovich and Graff, with
I red Meyer, a sophomore, and
Greer playing behind them. Then
almos' simultaneously Greer and
Meyc turned up with injuries,
and liny found himself in one
game with only three ends on the
entire squad.
# ❖ #
It seemed like a great move at the
i time when Tiny moved Ilamp Pool
! to the back field and Johnny Kerman
into the left guard position. Kerman
played brilliantly in the U.C.L.A.
i game, and just when great things
| were expected of him he turnel up
I with an injured leg that put him out
for the season.
At the same time when Kerman
was moved to the first string, light
guard Corky Donahue was shifted
to right tackle. But Corky was so
badly cracked up in the Santa Clara
game that he wasn't even able to
suit up for the U.S.C. end Washing
ton State games, and won't be at top

shape even if he does play tomorrow.
In tlie hackfield. Thor Peterson
wrecked his hack in practice right
after he had shown great promise
in the U.C.L.A. game as a relief
for Norm Standlee. His injury
kept Peterson out of action for
three games, forcing Standlee to
play almost (JO minutes of every
game.
Adding misery to misery, Gene
Coldiron turned in a brilliant line
backing game against U.S.C.. but
was carried off the field in the sec
ond half. Coldiron sat on the bench
during the Washington State game
and will be in far from good condi
tion against California.
As if all this wasn't enough, Jim
Groves decided to give up the sport
after the U.S.C. contest because of a
badly injured shoulder that had
been bothering him all season.
Of course, Cal can claim her
share of losses, too. First there
was Louis Smith, the lanky right
half who was being boomed for
All-American honors hut went out
with water on the knee. Smith,
who was the best kicker, passer,
blocker, and hall-carrier on the
Bear squad at the start of the sea
son. is expected to play tomor
row. hut it is almost impossible to
expect very much from him. what
with an almost seven-week lay
off.
