## 
### 
When Stanford and California tan
gle tomorrow in Stanford Stadium,
it will mark the tenth time that the
Big Game classic has been played on
the turf of the present plant, which
was built iti 1921.
Art Wilcox, a Stanford halfback,
had the honor of being the first play
er to score a Gig Game touchdown
on the new gridiron, although Cali
fornia, then in the midst of its
"Wonder Team" glory under the late
Coach Andy Smith, recovered from
the 7-0 deficit to score a smashing
42-7 victory.
Gene Van Gent was coach of the
Indians then, but was replaced the
following year by Tiny Thornhill
and Andy Kerr, now head mentor at
Colgate, who were sent ahead by
"Pop" Warner to get his system in
stalled while he was finishing up his
contract at Carlisle Institute. War
ner followed his two assistants West
in 15)24.
The original seating capacity of
Stanford Stadium was 60.000. but
enlargements in 1925 and 1927
brought the capacity tip to its piesent
, total of 90.000 persons.
While many complain th;<t of these
seats but 110,000 *if them are between
the goal posts, it is obvious that no
stadium of this size could possibly
put in more seats along two 100-yard
stretches. The only two Coast sta
diums biggci than the one at Stan
ford are at C;d and U.S.C.
