# Evenly Matched Cards, Bears To Clash in 45th Grid Classic
## Season's Records Go Out the Window as Old Rivals Collide with Axe as Symbol of Victory; Weaknesses Of Teams Promise to Make Battle Offensive Thriller 
### JERRY MAYER 
Sports Editor, The Stanford Daily
Forty-four times in the past Stanford University and the University of California hav
met on the football field. With the exception of the World War years of 1915-1918 th
Indians have opposed the Bears every season since 1892, first in rugby and later in America
football.
Tomorrow at 2 o'clock in Stanford Stadium, these two great Universities will face eac

other for the 15th time in a game that will decide which team stays out
n! the cellar of (he Pacific (.'oast Conference.
Mill to the Bay Region, and to every one of the thousands of Stanford
and California alumni scattered throughout the world, this is still TUil
Big fiame, where season records mean nothing compared (o the pride of
knowing that the famed Axe, ancient victory symbol of one of the oldest
rivalries in (lie annals of intercollegiate athletics, may reside in a promi
nent place on the campus of his alma mater.
California enters tomorrow's came as a slight favorite hut not sine.'
11)32. when the teams fought to a scoreless tic, has a Big Game appeared
as evenly matched as (he 1 !>!!!> edition looms.
Ilveiil.N matched in their impotence, perhaps, hut nevertheless, with
cufsidc pressure, such as a possible Hose Bowl bid, removed, this year's
game may take its place ?s one of the most thrilling Bear-Indian grid
games of all (inn*. F.ach outfit has its weaknesses—pronounced ones—but
cvciting football games are those in which each (earn bores at (he hole*, in
the opposing lineup. Tomorrow's game may well be one of the most spec
tacular offensive conflicts in I lie long history of (he series.
Cal's main weakness is in the center of the line and on (he flanks, which
means (hat !.<«• Artoe and Boh Kcinhard, (he two fine Bear tackles, will
have (heir work cut out for them.
When Norman Standlee. "The Chief," starts pounding through the Bear
guards. and speed-liurncr Pete Kinetovic whirls around the ends, Artoi
and Kcinhard are liable to find themselves with quite a task on their h nd
lidding the Bear line together.
( oach Leonard B. "Stub" Allison has a flock of promising sophomores
manning his flanks, plus a handful of mediocre holdovers from last year's
team, hut almost ever> foe luis run the Calfornia ends consistent'v I it

I substantial gains.
Charles Donohoe, a guard, has
played good defensive football in the
center of the Berkeley line, but lack
of any other outstanding talent in the
guard positions makes the territory
between the tackles a definite weak
ness. Partially remedying this de
ficiency is the line-backing prowess
of center Ralph Sauer.
Stanford's inexperienced right
tackles have been suckers for weaK
side plays all season, and tomorrow
I hey will be facing in Louis Smith,
Cal's lanky right half, a man whose
loping gait is liable to make those
sucker plays especially effective.
When Corky Donahue was holding
down the right tackle position his
experience made the right side well
nigh impregnable, but an injured
leg will prevent Donahue from start
ing, and even if he does see action
he will be in poor condition.
RESERVE TACKLES
That throws the burden on Ed
"Swede" Johansen, who will start,
and three equally inexperienced re
serves, John McDonough, Bill Trout,
and Jack Warnecke. However, Coach
Tiny Thornhill has hopes that he'll
get two good quarters of football out
of Donahue.
Chick Orme will start at right
guard and while he lacks speed, he
likes to get in and rough things up
one quality a number of the Cardinal
linemen haven't displayed in great
quantities this year.
The rest of the Stanford line has
proved itself already: Stan Graff,

left end; Captain Stan Andersen, left
tackle; Hamp Pool, left guard; Jim
Verdieck, center; and Andy Stojko
/ich, right end.
On a man-to-man comparison ba
sis, the rival backfields are approxi
mately even, with one man standing
out in each unit—Standlee for the
locals and Smith for the Bears.
STANDLEE—ALL-AMERICAN
Standlee's prowess needs no re
view; suffice it to say that he is an
All-American playing on a losing
team. Smith was being boomed for
national honors until water on the
knee put him on the shelf for several
weeks. Tomorrow he may be rusty,
due to his long layoff, but shaky oi
not he's a great threat in kicking,
passing, running, blocking, and pass
receiving. There's nothing this boy
xan't do.
Bear Glen Whalen and Indian Gene
Coldiran, rival quarterbacks, are
about a standoff, each being an un
j spectacular, effective blocking back.
Kmetovic, who is expected to open
| at left half for Stanford, and Tony
j Firpo, who plays the same position
j for the Bears, have each a peculiar
I talent.
Kmetovic can't pass hut he runs
J the ends like 'ell, while Firpo is an

excellent passer but only a mediocre
ball-toter. At right half, Smith takes
the nod from Stanford's Hugh Gal
larneau, while Standlee has a defi
nite advantage over Bear fullback
Ted Hubert.
CARD LINE BEST
All in all, the Indians should boast
a slight superiority in the line, with
the backiields even.
But the thing to remember is that
this is the Big Game, where yarns
like this just fill space and the play
ers turn in performances that belie
all the previous statistics.
And where the last minute lias
provided scores of spectacular touch
downs.
