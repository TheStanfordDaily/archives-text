Forty-four times in the past Stanford University and the University of California hav
met on the football field. With the exception of the World War years of 1915-1918 th
Indians have opposed the Bears every season since 1892, first in rugby and later in America
football.
Tomorrow at 2 o'clock in Stanford Stadium, these two great Universities will face eac

other for the 15th time in a game that will decide which team stays out
n! the cellar of (he Pacific (.'oast Conference.
Mill to the Bay Region, and to every one of the thousands of Stanford
and California alumni scattered throughout the world, this is still TUil
Big fiame, where season records mean nothing compared (o the pride of
knowing that the famed Axe, ancient victory symbol of one of the oldest
rivalries in (lie annals of intercollegiate athletics, may reside in a promi
nent place on the campus of his alma mater.

as evenly matched as (he 1 !>!!!> edition looms.
Ilveiil.N matched in their impotence, perhaps, hut nevertheless, with

game may take its place ?s one of the most thrilling Bear-Indian grid
games of all (inn*. F.ach outfit has its weaknesses—pronounced ones—but
cvciting football games are those in which each (earn bores at (he hole*, in

Cal's main weakness is in the center of the line and on (he flanks, which
means (hat !.<«• Artoe and Boh Kcinhard, (he two fine Bear tackles, will
have (heir work cut out for them.
When Norman Standlee. "The Chief," starts pounding through the Bear
guards. and speed-liurncr Pete Kinetovic whirls around the ends, Artoi
and Kcinhard are liable to find themselves with quite a task on their h nd
lidding the Bear line together.

team, hut almost ever> foe luis run the Calfornia ends consistent'v I it
