### ARCHIE RICE, '95 
(Ediotr's Note: The following letter by Archie Rice, '!)5. was pub
lislieil originally in (lie 19X5 Big Game edition of Tlie Stanford Daily.)

As I press-reported the first 24 Big Games, have witnessed some 70(1
gridiron, rugby, association, anil Gaelic foot hall contests, and 411 years
developed football charts, my present comments, flown across continent
from Washington, may have reader interest immediately preceding this
list California-Stanford meeting for the Big Came, an event that latterly

has ranked as the generally large.st-<
attended, most closely matched, most I
.sportsmanlike, most dramatically i
colorful, and spectacular and eli- .
maticnlly favored and high-class
athletic fixture in world history of
outdoor sports, and with the world's j
maximum number of intelligent '
women spectators.

S<fl Al> WEIGHED 17K
l'rior to the use of the shift in I
l%ti, to foster more open rugby, the I
heaviest Big Game varsity was
Stanford's 189-1 eleven, averaging
178 ; and the heaviest individual !
players were Haggard, '95, 22(i- J
pound center; Carle, '98, 212-pounds, j
liolh of Stanford, and Overall, 'Oil,
20!-]>ound California guard.
The probable potential All-Ameri- .
can material of the first 15-year pe
riod of the Big Games included:
Stanford—Williams, center; Carle,
Fiekert and McMillan, guards;
L'rager and Sprott, Uickles; Clarke,
end; Hunt, Ransome, Hall, Smith,
and Snedigar, bi.cks. The greatest
all-around kicker i>f that period was
Murphy, with Overall next.
The first Big Game was delayed
one hour because both teams forgot
It) provide a football.
PLAYERS SHOT BY CAE MAN
On the night of the 1894 Big
Game, Whitehouse, '90, former Stan
lord varsity tackle, and Rosenfeld,
.sub-halfback, were seriously
bullet-wounded and the face of Mc-
Millan, '97, former varsity guard,
was grazed by a third bullet from a
revolver lired at close range by a
disgruntled California undergradu
ate. Since there were no deaths, the
a (lair w;is hushed up and settled out
of court.
A l the 189(i Big Game, an incipient
riot, stalled by California students
allocking and wrecking the Stanford
core-board, was stopped by inrush
ing police.
The following year the roof over
Ihe center section, reserved for the
"society" set, hummocked down
and tobogganed three urchins, caus
ing a near panic, and bewildering as
to what had happened, so officials
promptly stopped the game four
minutes early, with Stanford near a
touchdown.
I I SPECTATORS KILLED
AI the last of the Thanksgiving
Big Games, in 1907, 14 spectators
were killed by the crash-in of a
skylight atop the roof of a nearby
gla works, where about 50 "dead
heads" were assembled.
A year later, at another Big
Game, 100 policemen with riot
clubs, patrolled the sidelines to pre
vent threatened mob reprisals by in
censed California students and
alumni, angered because "Locomo
tive" Smith had been debarred. A
neutral referee committee, composed
of alumni of 17 different Eastern
colleges, and appointed by the Uni
versity Club of San Francisco, had
decreed unanimously that Smith had
been guilty of deceit, of professional
ism as Oregon's paid varsity coach,
and Stanford was voted properly
justified in its protests and proofs.

ONE-COLOR COLLEGES
Oxford, Cambridge, Harvard, and
Yale are one-color colleges, and
proud of it. Wisconsin, Arkansas,
and Stanford are the only colleges
in the world using cardinal, and
cardinal alone. Almost 40 college in
lit utions are blue and gold.
San Francisco's wholesale florists
have determined that their flower
ales the day of the Big Game ex
ceed by approximately $50,000 the
flower sales of any other day in the
year.
Ignorant window dressers, wishing
1o balance blue and gold by two
colors, make Stanford red and
white. And florists take greater
profits .selling white chrysanthe
mums with a small red carnation in
the center than from huge bunches
ol red carnations alone.
'I iie result is that many present
tay Stanford collegians stupidly
■ oppose Stanford's colors are "red
and white"; while Stanford colle
i *iis jx*rmit the error, may they lose
each Big Game.
