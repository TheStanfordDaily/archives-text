Berkeley to run the Papoose losing
streak to four straight without a win
so far. Handicapped by lack of ex
perience, injuries, and ineligibilities,
Coach Tevfik Sadullah's boys drop
ped the opener to Menlo J.C. 5-2 and
then succumbed to Polytechnic High
of San Francisco, 4-0.
Then came their best game of the
dismal season, a 2-0 loss to a.strong
Peseadero High team. Last Satur
day's Cal tussle was a spirited one,
but the Stanford defense fell to
pieces in the final period and Cal
ran up three tallies in short order.
Because of their lack of experience,
there are few standouts on Sadul
lah's eleven. Tim Driscoll missed the
the first two combats because of in
eligibility but his presence at the
goalie spot has strengthened the
Papoose defense considerably.
Burton Berry, captain and center
half, has shown good form this year,
and Don Richards at wing has turned
in good performances.
