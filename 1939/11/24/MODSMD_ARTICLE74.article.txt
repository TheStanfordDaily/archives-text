# Thrills Headlight History of Big Game
## Cards Entered 1924 Game With No Chance, Earned 20-20 Tie in Last Seconds 
### PAT NOWELL 
20 to 20.
So ended the most thrilling Big
Game of all time —a game the late
Walter Camp called the greatest
contest he had ever seen.
This, the 1924 game, was the high
light of a series that started in 1892—
a series that has featured tense,
thrilling football year after year
with few exceptions.
Pop Warner's first Stanford team
went into the game as hopeless un
derdogs. They were playing one of
the finest of Andy Smith's Wonder
Teams without the services of their
two best backs, All-American Nor
man Cleaveland and a smashing,
plunging fullback named Ernie Nev
ers.
FOUGHT BEARS COLD
This Stanford club refused to be
lieve in Cal's invincibility. They
went out and fought the mighty
Bears to a complete standstill
throughout the first half, with Mur
ray Cuddeback booting two field
goals in the second quarter to put
the Stanfords out in front at half
time.
But Cal was a great team that day,
and they came back in the third
and first of the fourth quarters to
prove that they deserved the title
"Wonder Team." A pass, Cixon to
Imlay, went 47 yards to the Stan
ford nine, where Harry Shipkey
made a desperate tackle from be
hind. However, Cal scored two plays
later, and converted to lead, 7 to 6.
WONDER BOYS' LEAD
The early moments of the fourth
quarter found the "Wonder Boys"
converting another pass and a
blocked kick into two mere scores,
putting them comfortably out in
front, 20-6.
There were less than ten minutes
to play, and some of the less faithful
were starting ot leave the stadium,
when the fighting Cardinals came
back. Two lightning passes, and an
inspired leap by Ted Shipkey to
catch the ball in the end -zone gave
the Reds six points. Cuddeback's
conversion made it 13-20.
Then, with seconds left in the ball
game, Stanford powered down the
field to set up another touchdown
pass to Cuddeback. Cuddeback's
nonchalant conversion made it 20-
20, as 80,000 spectators went mad.
W ARNER COMMENTS
After the game Pop Warner la
conically commented:
"That'll be as close as Cal comes
to winning a Big Game for a long
time."
This was prophetic. The next year
Ernie Nevers, a flaming blond de
mon, handled the ball on all but
three of Stanford's offensive plays
to lead his team to a 27-14 victory—
Stanford's first win over California
in American football since 1905.

The Cardinal win streak extended
to 1931, broken only by a 13-13 tie
in 1928. The 1928 game rates up
near the 20-20 spectacle tor sheer
thrills. Cal led at the hall' 13-0, but
Si ink ins passbd to Frentrup in the
final seconds to tie the ball game.
BEARS WIN IN 1931
Little Hank Schaldach led Cali
fornia to its first victory in eight
years in 1931. The Indians missed
Phil Moffatt, star halfback, who sat
on the bench with an injured knee
while the Blue and Gold won, 0-0.
The next year found Stanford, a
definite pre-game underdog, rolling
over the mighty Bear for three
quarters, but failing ot score. Schal
dach, injury-ridden throughout the
season, came off the bench in the
fourth quarter to play the game of
his life and put Stanford on the
defensive, but the game ended 0-0.
The Vowing Sophs put the Red
shirts back in the win column in
1933, and managed to shut out the
Bears for three years.
CAL HOPES STOPPED
In their last Big Game in 1935, the
"sophomores" shattered the Rose
Bowl hopes of an undefeated and
untied Bear by the score of 13-0.
Grayson and Jimmy Coffis made the
two touchdowns in the first quarter
with apparent ease.
California has been tasting vic
tory for the last three years. In 1936
Perry Thomas made a miraculous
one-handed catch of Bottari's pass
and fell across the goal line to start
a parade of touchdowns and inter
cepted passes that ended with Cal
triumphant, 20-0.
CARDS LOSE IN '37
The Rose Bowl - bound Bears
squashed the Cards the next year,
13-0. Rain and mud slowed the In
dian speed backs, Paulman, Fay, and
CofiLs, and allowed the straight
ahead power of the Blue and Gold to
work to better advantage than the
Cardinal deception.
Last year the big red team twice
failed to score from the two-yard
line, and allowed the Golden Bear
to emerge triumphant, 6-0. The
game, although exciting, was a blow
to Cardinal supporters.

quarter found the "Wonder Boys"
converting another pass and a
blocked kick into two mere scores,
putting them comfortably out in
front, 20-6.
There were less than ten minutes
to play, and some of the less faithful
were starting ot leave the stadium,
when the fighting Cardinals came
back. Two lightning passes, and an
inspired leap by Ted Shipkey to
catch the ball in the end -zone gave
the Reds six points. Cuddeback's
conversion made it 13-20.
Then, with seconds left in the ball
game, Stanford powered down the
field to set up another touchdown
pass to Cuddeback. Cuddeback's
nonchalant conversion made it 20-
20, as 80,000 spectators went mad.

Ernie Nevers, a flaming blond de

three of Stanford's offensive plays
to lead his team to a 27-14 victory—
Stanford's first win over California
in American football since 1905.

The Cardinal win streak extended
to 1931, broken only by a 13-13 tie
in 1928. The 1928 game rates up
near the 20-20 spectacle tor sheer

BEARS WIN IN 1931
Little Hank Schaldach led Cali
fornia to its first victory in eight
years in 1931. The Indians missed
Phil Moffatt, star halfback, who sat
on the bench with an injured knee
while the Blue and Gold won, 0-0.
The next year found Stanford, a
definite pre-game underdog, rolling
over the mighty Bear for three
quarters, but failing ot score. Schal
dach, injury-ridden throughout the
season, came off the bench in the
fourth quarter to play the game of
his life and put Stanford on the
defensive, but the game ended 0-0.
The Vowing Sophs put the Red
shirts back in the win column in
1933, and managed to shut out the
Bears for three years.
CAL HOPES STOPPED
In their last Big Game in 1935, the
"sophomores" shattered the Rose
Bowl hopes of an undefeated and
untied Bear by the score of 13-0.
Grayson and Jimmy Coffis made the
two touchdowns in the first quarter

California has been tasting vic

and fell across the goal line to start
a parade of touchdowns and inter

triumphant, 20-0.

The Rose Bowl - bound Bears

This, the 1924 game, was the high
light of a series that started in 1892—
a series that has featured tense,
thrilling football year after year
with few exceptions.
Pop Warner's first Stanford team
went into the game as hopeless un
derdogs. They were playing one of
the finest of Andy Smith's Wonder
Teams without the services of their
two best backs, All-American Nor
man Cleaveland and a smashing,
plunging fullback named Ernie Nev
ers.
FOUGHT BEARS COLD
This Stanford club refused to be
lieve in Cal's invincibility. They
went out and fought the mighty
Bears to a complete standstill
throughout the first half, with Mur
ray Cuddeback booting two field
goals in the second quarter to put
the Stanfords out in front at half
time.
But Cal was a great team that day,
and they came back in the third
and first of the fourth quarters to
prove that they deserved the title
"Wonder Team." A pass, Cixon to
Imlay, went 47 yards to the Stan
ford nine, where Harry Shipkey
made a desperate tackle from be

BEARS WIN IN 1931
Little Hank Schaldach led Cali
fornia to its first victory in eight
years in 1931. The Indians missed
Phil Moffatt, star halfback, who sat
on the bench with an injured knee
while the Blue and Gold won, 0-0.
The next year found Stanford, a
definite pre-game underdog, rolling
over the mighty Bear for three
quarters, but failing ot score. Schal
dach, injury-ridden throughout the
season, came off the bench in the
fourth quarter to play the game of
his life and put Stanford on the
defensive, but the game ended 0-0.
The Vowing Sophs put the Red
shirts back in the win column in
1933, and managed to shut out the
Bears for three years.
CAL HOPES STOPPED
In their last Big Game in 1935, the
"sophomores" shattered the Rose
Bowl hopes of an undefeated and
untied Bear by the score of 13-0.
Grayson and Jimmy Coffis made the
two touchdowns in the first quarter
with apparent ease.
California has been tasting vic
tory for the last three years. In 1936
Perry Thomas made a miraculous
one-handed catch of Bottari's pass
and fell across the goal line to start
a parade of touchdowns and inter
cepted passes that ended with Cal
triumphant, 20-0.
CARDS LOSE IN '37
The Rose Bowl - bound Bears
squashed the Cards the next year,
13-0. Rain and mud slowed the In
dian speed backs, Paulman, Fay, and
CofiLs, and allowed the straight
ahead power of the Blue and Gold to
work to better advantage than the
Cardinal deception.
Last year the big red team twice
failed to score from the two-yard
line, and allowed the Golden Bear
to emerge triumphant, 6-0. The
game, although exciting, was a blow
to Cardinal supporters.
20 to 20.
So ended the most thrilling Big
Game of all time —a game the late
Walter Camp called the greatest
contest he had ever seen.
This, the 1924 game, was the high
light of a series that started in 1892—
a series that has featured tense,
thrilling football year after year
with few exceptions.
Pop Warner's first Stanford team
went into the game as hopeless un
derdogs. They were playing one of
the finest of Andy Smith's Wonder
Teams without the services of their
two best backs, All-American Nor
man Cleaveland and a smashing,
plunging fullback named Ernie Nev
ers.
FOUGHT BEARS COLD
This Stanford club refused to be
lieve in Cal's invincibility. They
went out and fought the mighty
Bears to a complete standstill
throughout the first half, with Mur
ray Cuddeback booting two field
goals in the second quarter to put
the Stanfords out in front at half
time.
But Cal was a great team that day,
and they came back in the third
and first of the fourth quarters to
prove that they deserved the title
"Wonder Team." A pass, Cixon to
Imlay, went 47 yards to the Stan
ford nine, where Harry Shipkey
made a desperate tackle from be
hind. However, Cal scored two plays
later, and converted to lead, 7 to 6.
WONDER BOYS' LEAD
The early moments of the fourth
quarter found the "Wonder Boys"
converting another pass and a
blocked kick into two mere scores,
putting them comfortably out in
front, 20-6.
There were less than ten minutes
to play, and some of the less faithful
were starting ot leave the stadium,
when the fighting Cardinals came
back. Two lightning passes, and an
inspired leap by Ted Shipkey to
catch the ball in the end -zone gave
the Reds six points. Cuddeback's
conversion made it 13-20.
Then, with seconds left in the ball
game, Stanford powered down the
field to set up another touchdown
pass to Cuddeback. Cuddeback's
nonchalant conversion made it 20-
20, as 80,000 spectators went mad.
W ARNER COMMENTS
After the game Pop Warner la
conically commented:
"That'll be as close as Cal comes
to winning a Big Game for a long
time."
This was prophetic. The next year
Ernie Nevers, a flaming blond de
mon, handled the ball on all but
three of Stanford's offensive plays
to lead his team to a 27-14 victory—
Stanford's first win over California
in American football since 1905.

The Cardinal win streak extended
to 1931, broken only by a 13-13 tie
in 1928. The 1928 game rates up
near the 20-20 spectacle tor sheer
thrills. Cal led at the hall' 13-0, but
Si ink ins passbd to Frentrup in the
final seconds to tie the ball game.
