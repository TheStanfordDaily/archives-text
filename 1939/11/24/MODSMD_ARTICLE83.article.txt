# Lettermen Bolster Cardinal Hopes for Good Net Season
## Sophomore Sensation Larry Dee, Transfer Jimmie Wade Rated High 
### BOB LOW 
Stanford tennis is on its way out of
the doldrums.
With five returning lettermen bol
stered by a sophomore who last year
was good enough to beat any man
on the varsity and a transfer who
already looks like the outstanding
doubles player in school, Coach
Sherrn Lockwood has hopes of hav
ing a team that will be among the
best in the nation when the season
opens next quarter.
Lockwood's hopes rest on the
shoulders of these two additions to
Stanford's tennis forces. Larry Dee,
captain of the yearlings last season,
is assured of being named the second
best junior in the United States
when the official rankings appear in
January.
DEE LISTED HIGH
In addition, Dee, by virtue of his
showing in the big time grass tour
naments last summer, may find him
self listed among the top twenty
amateurs in America. If Dee con
tinues to improve, Lockwood's hopes
may be realized, because Dee has
the potential ability to beat any man
m the coast conference.
Jimmy Wade, a transfer from
I Pasadena J.C., is the other man on
| whom Lockwood places his hopes.
; Teamed w.'th Dee in doubles, Wade
I will add tremendously to the
! strength of the Stanford line-up. and
| the pair shouldn't go into any colle
j giate match in the role of underdogs.
NUMBER 2 SPOT OPEN
i Wade will fight it out with Bob
Low, number one man on last year's
varsity, who turned in several good
wins in the Eastern circuit during
the summer, for the number two
singles berth.
j In Captain Dave Brock, Jim Sea
i ver, and Lloyd Gates, Stanford has
I three players who. have had two

years of varsity experience in addi
tion to several months of competition
in the East. These three can be ex
pected to take the majority of their
matches in the last three singles
positions.
But evefi these veterans can't be
sure of their posts, for there are two
other lettermen—Myron Folsom and
Stan Owen—who might edge one of
the others out of a starting place.
SC. FAVORED
On paper, Stanford has a power
ful bunch, but S.C. looks like the
pre-season favorite in the conference
race. The Trojans didn't lose a valu
able man from last year's second
place squad, and they will be
strengthened by the eligibility of
Bill Reedy, George Toley, Ted
Schroeder, and Myron McNamara.
California, defending champions,
have lost through graduation three
members of the team that many
thought was the best in the nation.
But the Bears will have Bob Har
man, Bob Peacock, and Glenn Hip
pensteil to start off with.

other lettermen—Myron Folsom and
Stan Owen—who might edge one of
the others out of a starting place.
SC. FAVORED
On paper, Stanford has a power
ful bunch, but S.C. looks like the
pre-season favorite in the conference
race. The Trojans didn't lose a valu
able man from last year's second
place squad, and they will be
strengthened by the eligibility of
Bill Reedy, George Toley, Ted
Schroeder, and Myron McNamara.
California, defending champions,
have lost through graduation three
members of the team that many
thought was the best in the nation.
But the Bears will have Bob Har
man, Bob Peacock, and Glenn Hip
pensteil to start off with.
Stanford tennis is on its way out of
the doldrums.
With five returning lettermen bol
stered by a sophomore who last year
was good enough to beat any man
on the varsity and a transfer who
already looks like the outstanding
doubles player in school, Coach
Sherrn Lockwood has hopes of hav
ing a team that will be among the
best in the nation when the season
opens next quarter.
Lockwood's hopes rest on the
shoulders of these two additions to
Stanford's tennis forces. Larry Dee,
captain of the yearlings last season,
is assured of being named the second
best junior in the United States
when the official rankings appear in
January.
DEE LISTED HIGH
In addition, Dee, by virtue of his
showing in the big time grass tour
naments last summer, may find him
self listed among the top twenty
amateurs in America. If Dee con
tinues to improve, Lockwood's hopes
may be realized, because Dee has
the potential ability to beat any man
m the coast conference.
Jimmy Wade, a transfer from
I Pasadena J.C., is the other man on
| whom Lockwood places his hopes.
; Teamed w.'th Dee in doubles, Wade
I will add tremendously to the
! strength of the Stanford line-up. and
| the pair shouldn't go into any colle
j giate match in the role of underdogs.
NUMBER 2 SPOT OPEN
i Wade will fight it out with Bob
Low, number one man on last year's
varsity, who turned in several good
wins in the Eastern circuit during
the summer, for the number two
singles berth.
j In Captain Dave Brock, Jim Sea
i ver, and Lloyd Gates, Stanford has
I three players who. have had two

years of varsity experience in addi
tion to several months of competition
in the East. These three can be ex
pected to take the majority of their
matches in the last three singles
positions.
But evefi these veterans can't be
sure of their posts, for there are two
other lettermen—Myron Folsom and
Stan Owen—who might edge one of
the others out of a starting place.
