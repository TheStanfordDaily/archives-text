# Newcomers To Bolster Swim Team
## Co-Captains Weeden, Vitousek to Head Group of Veterans 
### 
Around Co-Caplains Bill Wecden
and Roy Vitousek will ho built the
ID4O Stanford swimming team.
And with this pair as a start,
Coach Nort Thornton has a prom
ising outlook, in spite of the loss of
Paul Herron, the greatest freshman
swimming star in the nation last
year.
But Herron, holder or co-holder
with hi freshman mates of all but
three National freshman intercolle
giate marks, was not the only out
standing member of the outfit.
And .so up from the freshman
ranks will come Jim Canning, back
sl.rokor, Scott Dudley, breaststroker,
Gardner Miller and Brad Young,
free-stylers, and Howard Adams,
diver.
HOLDS RECORD
Dudley holds the national inter
collegiate freshman breast-stroke
j v cord, and Miller, while unable to
claim any individual mark, did some
iast paddling on the medley team
with Dudley and Herron, to set a
national record.
Adams is former Far Western
men's champion and the most prom
ising diving material since Roy
W-inkleman. He will be backed by
Bill Niccolls.
Canning won the frosh Big Meet
against California in faster time
than an oyf the Golden Bear var
sity baekstrokers, and in fast enough
time to take a third in last season's
varsity all-conference clash.
Pushing Canning for the No. 2
spot behind Co-Captain Bill Weeden
will bo a newcomer by the name
of Harry Dyck, a transfer, who has
faster high school times than Can
ning. fie is untried at collegiate
distances, however. George Concan
non is another comer.
Co-Captain Vitousek will do
both the breast-stroke and 50- or
100-yard free-style events. His
breaststroke marks are right on the
tail of those of Dudlej', whose frosh
mark is 2:.')0.7. Vitousek has done
2:31.2. Lloyd Wilson, a returning
letterman, has done 2:38.
learning in the sprints with Vi
tousek will be a fellow Islander,
Pete Okumoto. Pete made his debut
in the intramural meet last year
when his 50- and 100-yard times
were faster than those scored in
the Big Meet.
MILLER GOFS DISTANCES
Sophomore Miller was a sprinter
as a freshman, but he will be
shifted to the 220 and 440 by Coach
Thornton. Veteran Bob Livingston
will back him up.
Combining his best free-stylers,
Coach Thornton will have a 140-
yard relay team which can do 3.42,
probably a full second better than
any combination the championship
Southern California Trojans can
oft civ
"Those seven points," Thornton
points out. "are enough to win many
a swimming meet."
In summing it up, Thornton be
lieves things arc looking all right it
strength can be gained in the middle
distances â€”and all the new material
shapes up as expected.
