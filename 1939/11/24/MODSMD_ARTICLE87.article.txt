### 
I
Fifty-seven "men have turned out
for Coach H-irry Welter's baseball
squad, though the season is still
about 3 months away. This includes
lreshmen and varsity players togeth
er, and the total of 20 i'rosn is a
record for the yearlings for winter
baseball.
j Woltcr's prospects this year ap
| pear good, judging by last year's
j results, the few number of letter
| men who graduated, and by the new
talent that has either transferred
from Jaysecs or come up from the
frosh.
Though last year's team finished
tin fourth place in the conference,
! I hey won 8 games and lost 7. O!
this squad.only three men, A! La/.-
! zarone, Smokoy Clark, and Wally
doWitt have graduated.
The J.C. men whom Wolter will
be counting on are Alex Ccrghino,
j m outfielder from San Mateo Junior
i College, and Hal Costella. a first
| baseman also from San Mateo. Up
j from last year's hot. and cold frosh
j nine are pitchers Fied Meyer and
i Russ Smith, plus outfielders Milt

Vueinich and Johnny Sturgeon.
However, the bulk of the talent
lies in a bunch of juniors and seniors
who had experience from last sea
son. Wolter has an imposing pitch
ing staff in "Cootie" Thompson,
Claude Purlutt, Bill Masters, and
Gil Rahn.
Behind the plate will be either
Bill Jameson or Bill Adams. Norm
Juney, iast year's co-captain. Monte
Pfyl, Elton Boone. Dick Shortall,
Cookie South, Herb Bull, and Marty
Bains, all may be considered vet
erans.
The' returning outfielders are
Tlv-r Peterson, Bob and
Bili Adams.
