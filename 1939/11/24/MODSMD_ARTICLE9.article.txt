# Scribe Spies On Cal, Finds Gloomy Spirit
## 
### BUD AMES 
We spied on Cal.
Most of the Berkeley boy scouts
have gone running home to their
mothers for white meat and a shoul
der lo weep on. Those remaining
aren't any too happy about Big Game
prospects either.
Who's going to win the Big Game?
Unsuspecting California students,
who didn't know they were being
grilled by a nasty Stanford spy,
weren't so sure. Loyal souls, they
picked Cal as the possible victor—
but never by more than seven points.
HOW LACKS SriRIT
"Who cares about, the game?" a
fraternity man mumbled over his
morning pool cue. "I'm more inter
ested in the good time I'm going to.
have after the game!"
Heavens! At California too? That's J
the ol' tight—that's the old spirit.
"We've definitely got a first-half |
team," another stoogent admitted.;
["And if that southpaw Albert be-,
gins to connect with those passes— !
but he hasn't all season so why j
should he Saturday?"
I COPS PLAY BALL
Still another mentioned Firpo as a
"likely-to-star-Saturday" possibility.
! "He's good on defense; and we spend
i most of our time on the defense, so
i look for Firpo."
Yes, the boys up Berkeley way
I aren't ;iny too happy about this
; year's Big Game.
Neatest spirit - squelcher of the
week was pulled of! by Berkeley po
lice officers last Wednesday night.
Following tradition, the Cal lads built
bonfires in the streets, but instead
of arresting anybody, the police, us
ing child psychology, joined in the
fun. After all, it's no fun if you're
i not arrested, so the Cal lads finished
their all-day suckers, cleaned up
their bonfires, and went home to
| sulk. They're still sulking.
