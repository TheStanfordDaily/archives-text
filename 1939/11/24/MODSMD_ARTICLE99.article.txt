# Waterpoloists Lose Six Tilts In Nine Starts
## Veteran Squad Fails To Come Up to Early Season Predictions 
### 
Though they looked line at the
.start, Stanford's water polo team
went through one of the most dis
astrous of all seasons this year but
they did close with a 6-5 victory over
California.
Coach Nort Thornton's outfit
started the year with an outlook
brightened by a group of senior vet
erans—Bob Plate, captain, Dick
Hoover, Bill Bleecher, Frank Dowl
ing, Bill Burns, Bob Allen, and Roy
Vilousek.
Plate, Vitousek, Hoover, and Ted
Moreno, a junior, were second
string all-conference the year before.
Dowling was as good as Vilousek. j
Burns, ineligible last year had seen !
.second string all-conlerence honors,
two seasons back.
FORWARDS (iIVE TROUBLE
Bob Allen was chosen to handle
Ihe ccnterback post and managed
well from the start. But there was
some question about the forward
spots. Finally, with the first game
of the season against San Jose State,
Bill Bleecker and Dave Nottage were
given the starting assignments.
Following an easy win over the
Staters' vet* ran seven, came a Card
win over the Athens Club of Oak
land.
It was then that the Cardinals met
an immature season climax. With
the opening conference tilt against
U.C.L.A. Stanford was stopped.
DEFEAT U.S.C.
A loss to the San Francisco Olym
pic Club lollowed, and then the-
Cards got back on the band wagon
with a 3-2 upset of Southern Cali
fornia.
The next conference game was a
loss to U.C.L.A., then one to U.S.C.,
and then one to the University of
California. A last second goal
brought them a win over the Golden
Bears in a re-match.
The conference losses were pointed
by another licking at the hands ol
the Olympic Club and an upset by
San Jose.
Playing their last year for Stanford
this season were Plate, Hoover,
Bleecker, Burns, Dowling, and Allen.
Back for next season will be Mo
reno. Duncan Patty, who worked
himself into a first string centerback
spot, Vitousek, Fred Manwaring, and
Bill Weeden.

Plate, Vitousek, Hoover, and Ted
Moreno, a junior, were second
string all-conference the year before.
Dowling was as good as Vilousek. j
Burns, ineligible last year had seen !
.second string all-conlerence honors,
two seasons back.
FORWARDS (iIVE TROUBLE
Bob Allen was chosen to handle
Ihe ccnterback post and managed
well from the start. But there was
some question about the forward
spots. Finally, with the first game
of the season against San Jose State,
Bill Bleecker and Dave Nottage were
given the starting assignments.
Following an easy win over the
Staters' vet* ran seven, came a Card
win over the Athens Club of Oak
land.
It was then that the Cardinals met
an immature season climax. With
the opening conference tilt against
U.C.L.A. Stanford was stopped.
DEFEAT U.S.C.
A loss to the San Francisco Olym
pic Club lollowed, and then the-
Cards got back on the band wagon
with a 3-2 upset of Southern Cali
fornia.
The next conference game was a
loss to U.C.L.A., then one to U.S.C.,
and then one to the University of
California. A last second goal
brought them a win over the Golden
Bears in a re-match.
The conference losses were pointed
by another licking at the hands ol
the Olympic Club and an upset by
San Jose.
Playing their last year for Stanford
this season were Plate, Hoover,
Bleecker, Burns, Dowling, and Allen.
Back for next season will be Mo
reno. Duncan Patty, who worked
himself into a first string centerback
spot, Vitousek, Fred Manwaring, and
Bill Weeden.
Though they looked line at the
.start, Stanford's water polo team
went through one of the most dis
astrous of all seasons this year but
they did close with a 6-5 victory over
California.
Coach Nort Thornton's outfit
started the year with an outlook
brightened by a group of senior vet
erans—Bob Plate, captain, Dick
Hoover, Bill Bleecher, Frank Dowl
ing, Bill Burns, Bob Allen, and Roy
Vilousek.
