t'NGLAND may have another
small war on her hands.
At least, a sudden new Russian
threat to Finland, after a fortnight
of quiet in Soviet-Finnish relations,
« lincided this week-end with a
telling intensification of Germany's
sea war against Britain. It's pos
sible that the two latest develop
ments which dominate today's head
lines are not unrelated.
The Finnish-Russian conversations
in Moscow, over Russian demands
ostensibly prompted by need of
better defenses for vital Leningrad,
broke down because of Finnish re
sistance, supported largely by Brit
ain and great neutral America.

But Germany's successes at sea
with U-boats and mines have had an
important effect on the whole situa
tion. Not only have the British
losses been a serious blow to the
Allies, keeping them busy protect
ing themselves, but the Nazi sea
"blitzkrieg" caused Britain to deter
mine that things had gone far
enough. She decided to seize Ger
man exports, even from neutral ves
sels. And this move has caused a
perceptible cooling in relations be
tween Britain and the northern Eu
ropean neutrals, who ai"e, incidental
ly, important shippers and capable of
giving Johnny Bull some trouble.

along to act against Finland at
an opportune moment—and Che
Soviet press has indicated as much

There is really small chance that
any actual aid will be extended to
Finland by other powers.

Germany, over the week-end,
scored two major successes over
Britain on the sea. And London ad
mitted it. An armed auxiliary
cruiser and the former Polish liner,
Pilsudski, flying the Union Jack,
both were sunk. Possibly 300 lives
were lost and, in addition, four
smaller boats also were sent down
by torpedoes or mines.
The Russian-Finnish situation be
came steadily more intense. After a
week's bitter campaign against Fin
land by the Soviet press, it was an
nounced that Finnish artillery had
opened fire on Russian forces north
of Leningrad, killing or wounding
13 officers and men.
A strong note was handed the
Finnish ambassador in Moscow and
Russia demanded the immediate
withdrawal of the Finnish army
from the frontier area. Pravda, the
official Communist organ, accused
the Finns of "a foul and danger
ous game of trying to provoke war
against the Soviet Union" and
warned the Finnish premier, whom
it described as a "ridiculous buf
foon," that Finland may suffer the
same fate as Poland unless it sub
mits to Russia's military and terri
torial demands.

JpiNLAND categorically denied
firing on Russian troops and said
that removal of Irops from the bor
der, which would entail abandoning
their most important defense posi
tions, was not to be considei'ed. A
few hours later Pravda demanded
the resignation of iho Finnish gov
ernment and insisted that peaceful
negotiations couldn't proceed until
this condition was satisfied.
Molotov instructed the Soviet
troops not to return the fire. The
Red Army men were ordered to re
frain from any "enlargement of the
incident by retaliation."

The month-long negotiations be
tween the two nations have cen
tered around the defense of Len
ingrad. Molotov and Stalin have
contended that, inasmuch as Len
ingrad is only about 22 miles from
the Finnish border it is vulnerable
to artillery and air attack. If the
Finns moved back, as the Soviets
wish, they would be compelled to
abandon their "little IVlaginot
Line" of fortifications facing Rus
sia.

cruiser and the former Polish liner,
Pilsudski, flying the Union Jack,
both were sunk. Possibly 300 lives
were lost and, in addition, four
smaller boats also were sent down
by torpedoes or mines.
The Russian-Finnish situation be
came steadily more intense. After a
week's bitter campaign against Fin
land by the Soviet press, it was an
nounced that Finnish artillery had
opened fire on Russian forces north
of Leningrad, killing or wounding
13 officers and men.
A strong note was handed the
Finnish ambassador in Moscow and
Russia demanded the immediate
withdrawal of the Finnish army
from the frontier area. Pravda, the
official Communist organ, accused
the Finns of "a foul and danger
ous game of trying to provoke war
against the Soviet Union" and
warned the Finnish premier, whom
it described as a "ridiculous buf
foon," that Finland may suffer the
same fate as Poland unless it sub
mits to Russia's military and terri
torial demands.

JpiNLAND categorically denied
firing on Russian troops and said
that removal of Irops from the bor
der, which would entail abandoning
their most important defense posi
tions, was not to be considei'ed. A
few hours later Pravda demanded
the resignation of iho Finnish gov
ernment and insisted that peaceful
negotiations couldn't proceed until
this condition was satisfied.
Molotov instructed the Soviet
troops not to return the fire. The
Red Army men were ordered to re
frain from any "enlargement of the
incident by retaliation."

The month-long negotiations be
tween the two nations have cen
tered around the defense of Len
ingrad. Molotov and Stalin have
contended that, inasmuch as Len
ingrad is only about 22 miles from
the Finnish border it is vulnerable
to artillery and air attack. If the
Finns moved back, as the Soviets
wish, they would be compelled to
abandon their "little IVlaginot
Line" of fortifications facing Rus
