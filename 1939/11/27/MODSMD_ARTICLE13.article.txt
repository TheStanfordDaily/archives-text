# '39 GAME GAIETIES HITS NEW HIGH
## Bulotti Turns Out Excellent, Starless Show 
### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
Handicapped by the fact that he
has seen only four editions of the !
Big Game Gaieties, this reviewer
only can state that last Friday's
show unquestionably was the best of
the lot. But he suspects that even if
he had been hanging around Stan
ford since the start of the Gaieties'
career, he still would hang the medal
for the best evening's entertainment
on this one.
That it lacked a brilliant individual
star —a Doodles Weaver, a Bob Mai
lett, a J. P. Cahn —was fortunate
for this year's extravaganza. Re
alizing that he didn't have a crutch
to lean on, Director Charlie Bulotti
went ahead and created a real show.
No stars, nothing arty — just a
damned good show.
SKITS ARE BACKBONE
The skits, backbone of any Gaie
ties, were almost entirely the work
of Harry Muheim, who turned out
six bell-ringers and only one stink
er, an unusually high average for
any college show anywhere. Satir
izing the Administration, Ex Com
mittee, The Daily, Hall men, Row
men, and practically everything else
on the campus, "Branner Hysteria"
was the outstanding outburst of the
Muheim mind.
The high diving act, in which Bu
lotti made his single tasteful ap
pearance, the satire on skit writing,
and the finale in the cocktail bar at
the top of the Hoover War Library
all contained the stuff of which
good shows are made.
Explaining that he changed
Thanksgiving "just because he want
ed to screw things up," Shorty Gran
nis gave a classic impersonation of
President Roosevelt, which brought
hysterical tears to the eyes of Re
publicans who haven't laughed since
March of 1932.
Aside from the fact that the Stan
ley and Livingstone running gag, a
hangover from other years, began
to pall after the fourth time, the
only blot on Muheim's escutcheon
was his ribbing of the question and
answer radio programs which for
some unexplainable reason was not
cut out of the show.
PORCH ACT OUTSTANDING
The outstanding act of the 1939
Gaieties, in this reviewer's estima
tion, was the pantomime on the fra
ternity house sleeping porch in
which Aubrey Austin, Marco Thome,
and Tony Cefaratti kept the au
dience roaring for ten minutes
straight.
The musical score of the show
vfas even brighter than that of the
i three previous editions. High spots
among 13 excellent numbers were
Bob Staver's "So the Story Goes,"
Hal Moreno , and Jane Thornton's
"So Long Ago," and Anne Beech,
Thornton, and Staver's "I Sent You
Away." "Farm Girl's Lament" and
"Why Don't You Leave Me Alone"
both suffered from self-conscious
renditions.


NEDRA BOARDWELL AND ADOLFO ARIAS lead the chorus in "Purum-Ban-Bon," the spectacular Gaie
ties version of the rhythmic Latin American Conga.
