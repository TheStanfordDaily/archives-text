# Farm Has Good Time Despite Team's Defeat
## Cal Rooting Section Gives Comic Relief To Gloomy Saturday 
### JEAN NOWELL 
With four years' experience to
provide the pattern, Stanford found
that it. could lose the Big Game and
still have a good time.
It was still fun for the Farm to
yell out its lungs in the rooting sec
tion, to boo Cal's rendition of the
Axe Yell, and to laugh at the Ber
keley man who was escorted out of
the stadium for lobbing an orange at
an irate policeman.
One Bear rooter's penchant for
torpedoes provided a strange cli
max to the game, for the continued
explosions, together with the dam
aged-by-rain timer, so confused the
Cal contingent that they poured
down on the field and splintered the
goal-posts three minutes before the
game was over.
CO-ED HELPFUL
The lone co-ed who wandered into
the Bear backfield during the goal
post demonstration did her bit to
add to one of the oddest finales a
Big Game has ever had.
According to remarks from both
rooting sections, neither side's card
stunts were up to par. But there
was no question about the noise
they made. Stanford's yelling cli
max came at half-time, when, as the
Stanford band stood in an axe for
mation, the Stanford side ripped out
the Axe Yell with a fervor that
caused one Cal rooter to comment
grudgingly that "it really sounded
good."
SOCKS REALLY LOUD
Ex-Student. Body President Bob
Brown's "lucky" socks presented to
Head Yell Leader Johnny Seamans
at last Thursday's rally made up for
lack of potency with vividness. So
much of the rooters' attention was
concentrated on Seamans' bright
red feet that, they experienced dif
ficulty in following the yells he was
leading.
Noblest single-handed effort of the
day was chalked up for Chuck
Taylor, frosh footballer, whose val
iant defense of the goal-posts was
commendable, but. futile.
Stanford lost the Big Game, but
the spirit of the day carried over to
Big Game Night., as sparsely-popu
lated 8 o'clocks and lagging feet along
the Quad testify today.

iant defense of the goal-posts was
commendable, but. futile.
Stanford lost the Big Game, but
the spirit of the day carried over to
Big Game Night., as sparsely-popu
lated 8 o'clocks and lagging feet along
the Quad testify today.
With four years' experience to
provide the pattern, Stanford found
that it. could lose the Big Game and
still have a good time.
It was still fun for the Farm to
yell out its lungs in the rooting sec
tion, to boo Cal's rendition of the
Axe Yell, and to laugh at the Ber
keley man who was escorted out of
the stadium for lobbing an orange at
an irate policeman.
One Bear rooter's penchant for
torpedoes provided a strange cli
max to the game, for the continued
explosions, together with the dam
aged-by-rain timer, so confused the
Cal contingent that they poured
down on the field and splintered the
goal-posts three minutes before the
game was over.
CO-ED HELPFUL
The lone co-ed who wandered into
the Bear backfield during the goal
post demonstration did her bit to
add to one of the oddest finales a
Big Game has ever had.
According to remarks from both
rooting sections, neither side's card
stunts were up to par. But there
was no question about the noise
they made. Stanford's yelling cli
max came at half-time, when, as the
Stanford band stood in an axe for
mation, the Stanford side ripped out
the Axe Yell with a fervor that
caused one Cal rooter to comment
grudgingly that "it really sounded
good."
SOCKS REALLY LOUD
Ex-Student. Body President Bob
Brown's "lucky" socks presented to
Head Yell Leader Johnny Seamans
at last Thursday's rally made up for
lack of potency with vividness. So
much of the rooters' attention was
concentrated on Seamans' bright
red feet that, they experienced dif
ficulty in following the yells he was
leading.
Noblest single-handed effort of the
day was chalked up for Chuck
Taylor, frosh footballer, whose val
iant defense of the goal-posts was
commendable, but. futile.
Stanford lost the Big Game, but
the spirit of the day carried over to
Big Game Night., as sparsely-popu
lated 8 o'clocks and lagging feet along
the Quad testify today.
