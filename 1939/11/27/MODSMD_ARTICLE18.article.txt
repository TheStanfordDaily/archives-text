# California Swamps Cards in Lopsided Win, 32-14; Albert Rallies in Fourth
## Bears Keep Axe, Passing Effective As Stojkovich, Standlee, Donahue Prove Lone Stars for Stanford 
### JERRY MAYER 
The Axe will remain at California for another year, at least.
California's Bears, playing their greatest game of the season, easily
rolled over Stanford's steam-less Red Machine last Saturday in thr Stan
ford Stadium for a 32-14 victory and the most lop-sided triumph in a
Big (iamc since Stanford's 41-0 triumph in 191W).

Loosing a flock of sophomore backs
at the Card line, and completing six
out of seven passes, Coach Leon
ard B. "Stub" Allison's Bears ran
roughshod over the Indians for all
except a few moments in the fourth
quarter when Frank Albert let fly *
couple of long passes that led to
Stanford's pair of touchdown*.
HEROES CAVORT
Stanford's heroes were few, prin
cipal among them being Corky Don
ahue, who played his heart out at
right tackle despite a heavy brace
on his knee that was the onJy thing
that kept him from limping. The
Bears had no difficulty in breaking
wide holes in the Card line at ev
ery position except Donahue's
where the fighting Irishman repulsed
them time and again.
Andy Stojkovich, playing next to
Donahue at right end, also turned in
his greatest defensive game of the
season.
'CHIEF" OUTSTANDING
In the backfield, Stanford's stand
outs were equally sparse. Norm
Standlee never had a chance to get
going against the fast-charging
•Bear line. The first time he carried
the ball, "The Chief" recoiled off
his piJed-up interference and took
off around x*ight end on his own for
ten yards as three Bears had clean
shots at him but bounced off. After
that he was stopped cold. "
ALBERT WORRIED
Albert had his moments — both
good and bad. With the score 2t>-0
against Stanford, he threw two
passes to Fred Meyer, one for a
touchdown and the other to the
one-yard line, and he also cn&t the
Cards 30 yards in penalties for in
tentionally throwing the ball away
to prevent being set for heavy lofises.
Another time he called for a first -
down pass when Stanford had but
four yards to go for a touchdown,
and the ball was intercepted on tlic
two-yard line.
Stanford scored its first touch
down right after the latter intercep
tion.
The Bears kicked out from behind
the goal and a couple of plays later
the Cards had their score when
Meyer slipped into the end zone be
hind Tony Firpo, Bear safetyman., to
take Albert's long pass over his
shoulder. The play started from the
27-yard line.
NORM TAKES OVER
Immediately followuig the suc
ceeding kick-off, Swede Johansen
dived on a Cal fumble on the Bear
26. On the first play Albert lofted
another long one to Meyer, who
caught the ball on the one-yard line
between a pair of Cal defenders and
was immediately dragged down.
"You take it over, Norm," the In
dians told Standlee in the huddle,
! and "The Chief" obligingly plunged
i headlong into the end zone for the
I second Stanford score. Albert con
verted both touchdowns.

between a pair of Cal defenders and
was immediately dragged down.
"You take it over, Norm," the In
dians told Standlee in the huddle,
! and "The Chief" obligingly plunged
i headlong into the end zone for the
I second Stanford score. Albert con
verted both touchdowns.
The Axe will remain at California for another year, at least.
California's Bears, playing their greatest game of the season, easily
rolled over Stanford's steam-less Red Machine last Saturday in thr Stan
ford Stadium for a 32-14 victory and the most lop-sided triumph in a
Big (iamc since Stanford's 41-0 triumph in 191W).

Loosing a flock of sophomore backs
at the Card line, and completing six
out of seven passes, Coach Leon
ard B. "Stub" Allison's Bears ran
roughshod over the Indians for all
except a few moments in the fourth
quarter when Frank Albert let fly *
couple of long passes that led to
Stanford's pair of touchdown*.
HEROES CAVORT
Stanford's heroes were few, prin
cipal among them being Corky Don
ahue, who played his heart out at
right tackle despite a heavy brace
on his knee that was the onJy thing
that kept him from limping. The
Bears had no difficulty in breaking
wide holes in the Card line at ev
ery position except Donahue's
where the fighting Irishman repulsed
them time and again.
Andy Stojkovich, playing next to
Donahue at right end, also turned in
his greatest defensive game of the
season.
'CHIEF" OUTSTANDING
In the backfield, Stanford's stand
outs were equally sparse. Norm
Standlee never had a chance to get
going against the fast-charging
•Bear line. The first time he carried
the ball, "The Chief" recoiled off
his piJed-up interference and took
off around x*ight end on his own for
ten yards as three Bears had clean
shots at him but bounced off. After
that he was stopped cold. "
ALBERT WORRIED
Albert had his moments — both
good and bad. With the score 2t>-0
against Stanford, he threw two
passes to Fred Meyer, one for a
touchdown and the other to the
one-yard line, and he also cn&t the
Cards 30 yards in penalties for in
tentionally throwing the ball away
to prevent being set for heavy lofises.
Another time he called for a first -
down pass when Stanford had but
four yards to go for a touchdown,
and the ball was intercepted on tlic
two-yard line.
Stanford scored its first touch
down right after the latter intercep
tion.
The Bears kicked out from behind
the goal and a couple of plays later
the Cards had their score when
Meyer slipped into the end zone be
hind Tony Firpo, Bear safetyman., to
take Albert's long pass over his
shoulder. The play started from the
27-yard line.
NORM TAKES OVER
Immediately followuig the suc
ceeding kick-off, Swede Johansen
dived on a Cal fumble on the Bear
26. On the first play Albert lofted
another long one to Meyer, who
caught the ball on the one-yard line
between a pair of Cal defenders and
was immediately dragged down.
