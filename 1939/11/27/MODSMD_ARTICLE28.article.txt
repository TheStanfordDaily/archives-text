## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 2(1 (UP). â€”A fresh attack upon the Administra
tion's reciprocal trade program, hailed by Secretary of State Cordell Hull
as a powerful force for world peace, was made tonight by Sen. Key Pitt
man. 1).. Nov., who challenged legality of the treaties.
Pitt man is chairman ol' the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to

which all treaties, except
cial pacts, entered into between this
government and foreign powers are ]
referred. Loss of his support would j
be felt keenly by the Administration I
if, as Hull demands, it seeks to ex- i
tend the line of the reciprocal trade
act which is due to expire next !
June.
WRITES GRADY
The Nevada senator assailed the |
program in a letter to Henry F. j
Grady, assistant secretary of state,
dealing with the proposed treaty
with Chile under which excise taxes I
on copper would be reduced.
Declaring he believes that treaties
executed under the act are subject |
to Senate ratification, Pittman wrote !
Grady that "there is serious legal !
question whether, under ("he act, ex- ;
cise taxes can he reduced." He in-r
sisted that it was generally under- i
stood in the Senate that agreements I
made under the act should not apply |
to excise taxes.
TRADE POLICY QUESTIONED j
He raised the question whether the L
entire trade program should be con- j
tinued in the face of the European j
war and general world unrest.
"How can any scientific body in !
the United States determine the cost 1
of production abroad tomorrow, un- j
der present world conditions?" he j
asked. "What will be the exchange
value of the pound sterling tomor
row, or six months from now?
What will be the exchange value
of the French franc tomorrow, or six
months or a year from now?
"The answer to those questions
depends upon the result of the war.
Who is there among us that can
prophesy with regard to the present
war?"
Nearly ten million rivets were used
in constructing the hull of the
Queen Mary, transatlantic liner.
