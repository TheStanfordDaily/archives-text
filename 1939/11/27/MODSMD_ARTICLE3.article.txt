# Hollywood Wage Squabble Settled

### 
HOLLYWOOD, Nov. 26 (UP).â€”
The city of Hollywood, which spread
out to twke in 20 huge movie stu
dios, breathed easier for the first
time in days tonight because film
producers and 35,000 studio techni
cians settled their irksome squabble
over wage increases.
Prospect of immediate 10 per cent
bigger pay envelopes left the mem
bers of American Federation of
Labor unions happy and the pro
ducers drew some satisfaction from
plans for new negotiations.
Leaders of both sides spent the
day resting from a climax as dra
matic as any devised by the highly
paid Hollywood scenarists. Pro
ducers, after standing pat on their
refusal to grant higher pay, sur
rendered to demands of the unions
yesterday under threats to strike at
the studios and darken the nation's
theaters.
