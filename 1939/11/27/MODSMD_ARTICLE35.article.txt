# Card Soccermen Down Bears on Home Field
## Victory Gives Intercollegiate Title to Cards 
### 
Stanford's varsity soccermen claim i
tliat they evened the score against
California Saturday.
Even though the burly Bear grid- j
ders messed up the Indian football!
team in the afternoon, Coach Harry I
Maloney's soccer club batted 100
per cent when they tromped on Cal, j
2-1, in the morning on the Farm!
field.
That victory meant three things..
They won the California Intercol- j
legiate soccer championship — just i
Stanford and Cal figuring in the title!
fight. They put the Bears out of the !
running for the Northern California
soccer race. And they earned gold
soccer halls to be presented them at
a banquet next month.

A Farm soccer enthusiast prom
ised Coach Maloney early in the sea
son that he would reward the Stan
fords with ihe banquet and gold
balls if they won the title from Cal.
In spite of the victory, however, |
Stanford's position in the Northern j
California conference wasn't im- j
proved an iota, but Cal's defeat did ;
leave the championship strictly up j
to San Jose State and the Univer- I
sity of San Francisco.
One more game remains on the j
Indians' schedule. U.S.F. meets the !
locals here Dec. 4.
CARD DEFENSE STRONG
Saturday's win was the first vie- |
tory in two starts, Maloney's outfit |
carrying a deadlock from last week, j
1-1. It was a transformed Card'
eleven which met the Bears. They
played a bang-up defensive game—
especially the backs, and the for
wards put on a display of 100 per j
cent teamwork which they haven't
shown in many a game.
Chris Sontum, left wing and key 1
man in the Cards' scoring all sea- !
son, got the Indians out of a 1-0 '
deficit in the second quarter when !
he made good an attempted goal.
Then with the score deadlocked he
took a penalty kick 12 yards out ,
early in the fourth period for the 1
deciding point.
Cal threatened in the final min
utes but Tito Sanz-Agero, the lanky j
goalie, and his Stanford backs held
them off long enough to cop the de
cision. Rudy Munzer took care of '
the goal in the first half and put in
a good performance, as did Cam ,
Pierce, Ed Rogers, George Dole, and \
Ken Cuthbertson, Stanford's game- I
to-game spark plugs.
A game with U.C.L.A. for this
week-end has been cancelled, ac
cording to 'Maloney.

Ken Cuthbertson, Stanford's game- I
to-game spark plugs.
A game with U.C.L.A. for this
week-end has been cancelled, ac
cording to 'Maloney.
Stanford's varsity soccermen claim i
tliat they evened the score against
California Saturday.
Even though the burly Bear grid- j
ders messed up the Indian football!
team in the afternoon, Coach Harry I
Maloney's soccer club batted 100
per cent when they tromped on Cal, j
2-1, in the morning on the Farm!
field.
That victory meant three things..
They won the California Intercol- j
legiate soccer championship — just i
Stanford and Cal figuring in the title!
fight. They put the Bears out of the !
running for the Northern California
soccer race. And they earned gold
soccer halls to be presented them at
a banquet next month.

A Farm soccer enthusiast prom
ised Coach Maloney early in the sea
son that he would reward the Stan
fords with ihe banquet and gold
balls if they won the title from Cal.
In spite of the victory, however, |
Stanford's position in the Northern j
California conference wasn't im- j
proved an iota, but Cal's defeat did ;
leave the championship strictly up j
to San Jose State and the Univer- I
sity of San Francisco.
One more game remains on the j
Indians' schedule. U.S.F. meets the !
locals here Dec. 4.
CARD DEFENSE STRONG
Saturday's win was the first vie- |
tory in two starts, Maloney's outfit |
carrying a deadlock from last week, j
1-1. It was a transformed Card'
eleven which met the Bears. They
played a bang-up defensive game—
especially the backs, and the for
wards put on a display of 100 per j
cent teamwork which they haven't
shown in many a game.
Chris Sontum, left wing and key 1
man in the Cards' scoring all sea- !
son, got the Indians out of a 1-0 '
deficit in the second quarter when !
he made good an attempted goal.
Then with the score deadlocked he
took a penalty kick 12 yards out ,
early in the fourth period for the 1
deciding point.
Cal threatened in the final min
utes but Tito Sanz-Agero, the lanky j
goalie, and his Stanford backs held
them off long enough to cop the de
cision. Rudy Munzer took care of '
the goal in the first half and put in
a good performance, as did Cam ,
Pierce, Ed Rogers, George Dole, and \
Ken Cuthbertson, Stanford's game- I
