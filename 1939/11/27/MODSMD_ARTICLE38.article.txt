# The 						Stanford Daily SPORTS
## COULDN'T STOP CARD SCORE 
### JERRY MAYER, Sports Editor 

TONY FIRPO, shown above in the Cal-U.C.L.A. game, wasn't doing
much of this sort of running last Saturday afternoon. Team-mates
Smith, Perry, Hatcher. McQuary and Yotidall did most of the suc
cessful ball-carrying for the Bears. Albert's pass to Fred Meyer for
the first Stanford touchdown against Cal since 1935 went right over
Tony's head.
