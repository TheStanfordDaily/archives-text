Stanford's locker room after last
Saturday's Big Game presented a
study in dejection. The players had
honestly believed that they had a
chance to defeat California, and the
lop-sided trimming they received hit
them especially hard.
Frank Wickhorst, Bear line coach
and himself a great tackle at Navy
many years ago, came into the locker
room to give Captan Stan Andersen
a pat on the back. There were only
a few players left when Wickhorst
came in and the Bear coach apolo
gized for not getting there sooner.
"It was just one of those things
today. And we needed that vic
tory just as much as you did."
Anderson himself thought that
Cal last week-end was just as
tough as Southern California had
been.
"By golly, those guys hit hard
today," he said, sadly shaking his
head.
Corky Donahue, who turned in
a really great game at tackle, was
equally as downcast as Andersen.
"Man to man we're as good as al
most every team we've met this
year," said Corky, "but we just
couldn't seem to hit it off together.
I don't know, I can't figure it out."
But Donahue is too good-natured
to be down at the mouth for any
length of time, and a minute later
he was kidding about the date he
was going to try and get with Brenda
Frazier, the mil ion-dollar debutante,
in New York, where the team is now
en route for the Dartmouth game
next Saturday.
Hamp Pool couldn't seem to figure
things out.
"I could get my fingers on that
runner every time, but doggone if he
wouldn't rip away. It seemed to
happen on every play.

Corky Donahue and Gene Cold
iron played last Saturday with
braces on their logs, and most of
the time were playing on intestinal
fortitude alone. Coldiron took a
tremendous beating on his bad leg
and was limping badly after the
while Donahue, whom the
C;;l players gave credit as being
the only Stanford man who got
the front of his jersey dirty, earne
out somewhat better, although he
too was limping a little.

INDIAN GAME WITH
INDIANS IN NEW YORK
Stanford's Red Indians and Dart-

By JERRY MAYER

mouth's Green Indians have a little
rendezvous in New York come Sat
urday.
The word "rendezvous" is used
advisedly as it implies a secret
meeting and experts claim that the
Stanford-Dartmouth gartte prob
ably will be in the nature of a se
ciet practice session since it is
sure to be one of the poorest inter
sectional drawing cards in recent
years in New York.
Dartmouth's record is a little bet
ter than Stanford's, but even then
the Hanover Indians have lo.st to
every good team they've played,
which number only two —Princeton
and Cornell.
But Stanford can beat that
achievement—with the exception of
the U.C.L.A. tie, they've lost to
EVERY TEAM, good, bad, or indif
ferent.
