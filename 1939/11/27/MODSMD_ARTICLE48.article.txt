# A 						Tradition Is Born

### 
A LAW of economics worked Saturday
night.
Six hundred ten Stanford students created
a demand for an entertaining, yet inexpensive
Big Game night â€”and the A.S.S.U. dance at
the Millbrae Country Club supplied it.
Jimmy Grier's music was good, the clubhouse
was adequate, the Associated Students made
$169 profit, and, most important of all, every
body had a good time.
Enough bids had been purchased at the
A.S.S.U. office by Saturday morning to insure
the dance against any financial loss. And as
ticket after ticket was sold at the door, the fact
that Stanford wants and needs a Big Game
dance was proved conclusively.
Only one more step remains to be taken.
An off-campus after-the-game dance should be
made an annual affair.
With last Saturday night as a practical dem
onstration that the event involves no danger
ous precedent, Ex Committee can approve the
dance without hesitating next year. There need
be no battles over the council table, no frantic
search for a country club, no eleventh-hour
signing of an orchestra.
That there will be a second annual Big Game
dance is almost definite.
For already it has become a tradition.
