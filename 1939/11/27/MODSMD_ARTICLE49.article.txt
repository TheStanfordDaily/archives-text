# They Mean Well

THIS week the Youth Committee Against War
is issuing a "call" to America's young people
notifying them of a National Youth Anti-War
Congress. To each college newspaper, to each
organization of persons who fall into the un
certain classification "youth," have gone these
notices.
And so they will gather at Chicago Decem
ber 27-30, their avowed intentions being to
keep America out of the present war, to make
future world wars impossible. The worthiness
of their aims is unguestioned—their proposed
methods for achieving these aims constitute
perhaps the most impractical ideology yet fur
thered for the purpose.
America's youth cannot prevent war from
reaching this country, or prevent this country
from seeking war, by signing the Oxford pledge
and calling a strike.
The Youth Committee recommends that a
halt be called to the march of militarism in the
United States. The sentiment is laudable, until
they include national defense in this threaten
ing militarism. The practicality of a recom
mendation to halt the national defense can be
seriously guestioned.
They also urge adoption of a "genuine war
referendum amendment." With bland disre
gard of the effects of propaganda upon the
average voter, they would put the guestion of
peace or war upon the popular ballot. A glance
at the record of the Tammany machine in
propagandizing voters, buying votes, and
swinging pressure groups, makes the popular
referendum as applied to war a horrifying
prospect.
Other policies of the committee seek to abol
ish industrial mobilization laws—and inciden
tally hamstring any attempt at national de
fense. They call for a "real internationalism"—
with America letting down its immigration gates
for an oppressed horde of the world's refugees.
Just what this country is to do with the influx
is left to this "real internationalism," which
somehow seems to alter the cold fact that we
can't take care of the population as it stands at
present.
The cause of peace today needs no such rea
soning as this. Any solution must be based
upon knowledge and not upon emotion. The
Youth Committee Against War has a fine ideal,
but unfortunately the problem demands more
than good intentions.—J. B.
