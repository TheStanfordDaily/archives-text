# When Greek Meets Greek

### 
WHILE Stanford's down-at-the-mouth foot
ball team boarded its first-class train for
the East Saturday night, two other representa
tives of the University hopped onto a tourist
coach and headed for New York.
As president and secretary of Interfraternity
Council, Bob Moulton and Dick Hoover will
listen and speak for Stanford's 25 houses at
the annual session of the National Interfrater
nity Conference next week.

They will hear talks and will take part in sym
posia on many of the problems facing Greek
letter organizations at the present time. Rush
ing, finances, campus relations, pledge train
ing, social programs, co-operatives, and inter
fraternity activities are on the docket, according
to the Conference's announcement, but Hell
Week and scholarship, the current headaches
on the Row, are not specifically mentioned.
It is costing 25 fraternities approximately
$500 to send their representatives to the con
vention. Certain it is that the men will enjoy
themselves and that they will bring back a
number of valuable ideas with them.
But will the Stanford chapters derive $500
return from the trip?
The prestige that the representation of the
local Interfraternity Council brings is worth
something —and that much can be deducted
from the bill. But the Greeks still are on the
red side of the ledger unless the suggestions
that come out of the Conference are practical
and worth-while putting into execution at Stan
ford.
If Moulton and Hoover return with answers
for the Hell Week and scholarship problems,
their trip will be worth a great deal more than
the fraternities paid for it.
But if the houses do not take advantage of
the results of the Conference, they might just
as well spend the money on more steaks for
rushing next year.
