### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
SCHOLARS LOCKED OUT
WOME co-operative administrator has certainly been
doing his best to see that Big Game spirit shall
never lag. No study Thursday night; that was the
Big Game Rally. No study Friday night; who wants
to study after Stanford's most brilliant Big Game
Gaieties? No study Saturday night—obviously. And
Sunday, just to keep things harmonious, Quad rooms
are locked tighter than Roble at 3 o'clock in the
morning.
Well, that's fine. That makes the week-end com
plete. There was absolutely no danger of anyone's
sneaking in a quiet study hour before the Libc
opened.
But what about other Sundays and other nights,
when many or all rooms on the Quad are locked as
though they were filled with platinum desks and
black-diamond blackboards, and as though sneak
thieves were lurking on the Inner Quad. Any really
desperate criminal will not be stopped by a bolted
door; so why not leave the rooms open and let these
phantom desperadoes just walk in. Who knows —maybe
a few people will come in to study, along with the
thieves.
* # !<S *
|>ESIDES the anti-burgling explanation, there is,
however, another possible theory. Maybe the Uni
versity is staging a subtle hint that there is really no
good place 1o study besides the Quad. If so, the point
is well-taken, although irrelevant.
No, one cannot study in one's room with impunity.
Some good friend will always entertain one. And on
Monday nights laundry agents will smile you to death.
It is also true that the Libe is less a place for study,
and more a place for assorted social contacts and
ogling coke-dates. Then, of course, there are obvious
disadvantages to studying on the lawn, in the Union
Cellar, in so-called study rooms, or in the power
house.
But all that has just been taken for granted, like
the boorishness of people who set of! firecrackers at
football games or use other schools' yells. There is no
need for Quad rootns to be locked as a reminder that
there is no other place to study. In fact, it is almost
logical to assume that the already-crippled scholastic
endeavors of Stanford students should not be further
discouraged by keeping them out of refuges on the
Quad.
Oh. well, maybe we shouldn't try to study. One
learns so much more from experience anyway.

No, one cannot study in one's room with impunity.
Some good friend will always entertain one. And on
Monday nights laundry agents will smile you to death.
It is also true that the Libe is less a place for study,
and more a place for assorted social contacts and
ogling coke-dates. Then, of course, there are obvious
disadvantages to studying on the lawn, in the Union
Cellar, in so-called study rooms, or in the power
house.
But all that has just been taken for granted, like
the boorishness of people who set of! firecrackers at
football games or use other schools' yells. There is no
need for Quad rootns to be locked as a reminder that
there is no other place to study. In fact, it is almost
logical to assume that the already-crippled scholastic
endeavors of Stanford students should not be further
discouraged by keeping them out of refuges on the
Quad.
Oh. well, maybe we shouldn't try to study. One
learns so much more from experience anyway.
SCHOLARS LOCKED OUT
WOME co-operative administrator has certainly been
doing his best to see that Big Game spirit shall
never lag. No study Thursday night; that was the
Big Game Rally. No study Friday night; who wants
to study after Stanford's most brilliant Big Game
Gaieties? No study Saturday night—obviously. And
Sunday, just to keep things harmonious, Quad rooms
are locked tighter than Roble at 3 o'clock in the
morning.
Well, that's fine. That makes the week-end com
plete. There was absolutely no danger of anyone's
sneaking in a quiet study hour before the Libc
opened.
But what about other Sundays and other nights,
when many or all rooms on the Quad are locked as
though they were filled with platinum desks and
black-diamond blackboards, and as though sneak
thieves were lurking on the Inner Quad. Any really
desperate criminal will not be stopped by a bolted
door; so why not leave the rooms open and let these
phantom desperadoes just walk in. Who knows —maybe
a few people will come in to study, along with the
thieves.

versity is staging a subtle hint that there is really no
good place 1o study besides the Quad. If so, the point
is well-taken, although irrelevant.
