# CAMPUS OPINION
## TO A FIELD MOUSE 
### 
r rilE EDITOR, SIR:
We are replying to the letter of November 24th
written by "one of the men of Mice and Men." I am
not sure whether his criticism is really of the Inter
fraternity Council or of us personally. He is prob
ably not sure himself, since he obviously docs not
know a great deal about the matters which he pre
tends to criticize.
Nevertheless, this gentleman should know that In
tegrate rnity Council is not soliciting the approval of
the Administration, as such, nor is it anxious to have
the praise of individuals like him, who reason and
speak on the basis of partial information and misin
formation.
* * * *
| F\ MR. MOUSE would like to call some day at the
Interfraternity Council office, we should be glad to
have him read the Interfraternity Council Constitu
tion, the Interfraternity Board of Control Constitution,
and glance at the Fraternity Criteria. Also he will be
welcome to attend an Interfraternity Council Meeting
if he is not. a house president. Further, I believe I can
show him the reasonable basis for every action taken
thus far this year. The Administration is, in the main,
simply asking that we enforce our own rules—some
thing we have not done.
Mr. Man's letter is silly. He is not even funny. He
does not understand that at which his vindictive
criticism and poor reasoning is directed. I doubt if
Steinbeck would be proud of the signature.
Men sign their own names; mice don't.
