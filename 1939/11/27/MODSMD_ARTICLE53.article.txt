r rilE EDITOR. SIR:
In the interest of historical accuracy, may I cor
rect. the statement used in a "filler" in The Daily that
"Florida is the only state in the Union without a state
highway patrol system"? /Under Governor "Our
Dave" Schultz (1933-37) a highway patrol was estab
lished by gubernatorial order, and an honor guard of
motor patrolmen accompanied "Our Dave" in his ca
pacity of Grand Exalted Ruler of Elks to Los Angeles
for a national convention.
Although later eliminated by economy-minded in
cumbent Governor Fred P. Cone, the state highway
patrol was ordered re-established by act of the Florida !
Legislature in 1939. Cost of the patrol is being met by
a license tax of 50 cents on each auto driver.
Yours very truly.
