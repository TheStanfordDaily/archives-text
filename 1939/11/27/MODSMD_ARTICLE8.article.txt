# Stanford Men Liked Albert—Win or Lose
## 
### BUD AMES 
After the Big Game. So what
then? What do and don't Stanford
ites think concerning ljst Saturday's
game and Cardinal team?
"Confidentially—a Branner man
hissed with definiteness yesterday
morning.
"That goes for me too," a fellow
believer added. "It's a good tiling we
had Albert yesterday. He was the
whole team."
Such seems to be the consensus.
Stanford men generally select Al
bert as Saturday's Cardinal hero,
with Chief Standlee and Freddy
Meyer, the end who caught the first
touchdown pass and set up the sec
ond, tagging close behind.
"I picked Cal to win by about 13
points, but not by that score," the
Hall man continued. "In fact I was
so sure Cal was going to win that
I went out and made party-party
Friday night. I figured I might as
well enjoy myself while I could.
Boy, were we pad! Wow!"
Why was California so good? No
Stanfordite was sure, but all agreed
that the California players must have
worked themselves into such a psy
chological state that they played
far above their heads. All loved the
running of Hatcher and Perry.
In the Toyon lobby, a baggy-eyed
Hall man was chuckling to himself.
"Boy, that sure was some trick play
when they passed the ball to Stan
ford's invisible backfield man," he
mumbled. "If the pass from center
had gone a little higher, California
could have intercepted and run for
a touchdown. Ha, ha! Very funny!
And what did the happy little
Redmen do Saturday night after the
game?
FEW FACES SHOWN
The Redmen didn't show very
many faces in the San Francisco
hotels. A scientific survey-search of
the Palace, St. Francis, Mark, and
Fairmont hotels revealed only a few
—a very few—Stanford faces, most
of which were hidden insignificantly
in dark corners.
Southward was the trend—down to
Rio del Mar and the second campus
at Del Monte. Spies tell that Rio
del Mar had more celebrants—well,
hardly—than they could handle, and
almost 200 couples camped at Dei
Monte. Tliere is nothing like the deep
South after the Big Game.
PAST COVERED
So much for the dark past. As to
the future—
"The Dartmouth team will run our
line silly," a typical Row man ranted.
"I understand they've got a good
team. We've never lost to them be
fore and this one will be hard to
take."
"Gad, I wish we would win just
one game," another Row man wailed.
Come, come, gentlemen! We must
n't get bitter—or must we?
