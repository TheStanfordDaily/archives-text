# Stanford Men Liked Albert—Win or Lose

### BUD AMES 
After the Big Game. So what
then? What do and don't Stanford
ites think concerning ljst Saturday's
game and Cardinal team?
"Confidentially—a Branner man
hissed with definiteness yesterday
morning.
"That goes for me too," a fellow
believer added. "It's a good tiling we
had Albert yesterday. He was the
whole team."
Such seems to be the consensus.
Stanford men generally select Al
bert as Saturday's Cardinal hero,
with Chief Standlee and Freddy
Meyer, the end who caught the first
touchdown pass and set up the sec
ond, tagging close behind.
"I picked Cal to win by about 13
points, but not by that score," the
Hall man continued. "In fact I was
so sure Cal was going to win that
I went out and made party-party
Friday night. I figured I might as
well enjoy myself while I could.
Boy, were we pad! Wow!"
Why was California so good? No
Stanfordite was sure, but all agreed
that the California players must have
worked themselves into such a psy
chological state that they played
far above their heads. All loved the
running of Hatcher and Perry.
In the Toyon lobby, a baggy-eyed
Hall man was chuckling to himself.
