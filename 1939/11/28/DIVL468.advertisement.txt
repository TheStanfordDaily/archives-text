button points are so placed to effect an outward
roll of the collar, achieving that desirable casual
appearance. College men will especially ap
preciate this shirt for wear with tweeds and
rough finish clothes.
Ask your Arrow dealer for the Arrow Dover

also patterns. Sanforized-Shrunk (fabric shrinkage
