### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
weeks from today you're
going to be opening those blue
books again.
That's bad news and this is no
time to bring it up. England, though,
has been writing some blue books.
And, like a lot of Stanford blue
books, they've got her in ti-ouble.
The German government said
yesterday, with the tone of a strict
professor, that England's blue book
flunked her in the international
situation. The Nazis arc sure that
Britain's recent blue book on the
origins of the war contains in
disputable proof that Great Brit
ain played a "treacherous, two
faced game," which forced Poland
into war with Germany.

T™ German statement asserted
that on Aug. 28, three days be
fore the Nazi invasion of Poland,
the British government committed a
"forgery merely in order to gain
time" and stave oft the war for a
few days. This "forgery and sheer
lie," according to the Germans, was
a memorandum delivered to Ger
many from British Foreign Secre
tary Viscount Halifax saying that
Poland would send a plenipotentiary
to Berlin to negotiate a settlement of
Germany's demands.
Actually, they contend, Poland
hadn't consented to any such
measure and was feverishly pre
paring for war. The British blue
book was described by the Nazis
as "an unsuccessful attempt to es
cape responsibility—that is to say,
a feeble attempt at misrepresenta
tion of the truth."

any logical professor, then,
Germany went ahead to enumer
ate five specific points that, she said,
were "proven" by the British blue
book. The arguments, though, were
not so logical.
First of all, the Nazis said, Lord
Halifax "grossly deceived" the Ger
man government by asserting that
he had received word from Warsaw
that the Poles were ready for nego
tiations with Germany. The Poles
actually had made no such declara
tion, according to Hitler's aides.
Sir Howard Kennard, British
ambassador to Warsaw, delayed
carrying out instructions from
London to ask the Poles to enter
into negotiations and this "inten
tional" delay was so long that the
time-limit fixed by the Nazi ulti
matum to Poland elapsed. What
ever moves Germany took there
after may be directly attributed to
the delay caused by Chamberlain's
Warsaw chieftain. This, of course,
may or may not be true. There is
no way of settign the blame in
such a situation.
the Polish gov
ernment, the Nazis say, refused
to negotiate on the basis of "the
moderate German proposals" because
it believed in the British assur
ances of military aid which failed to
materialize. The obvious flaw in this
reasoning is that the Nazi proposals
were not exactly mild. Somehow,
Nazi proposals have never been not
ed for their moderation. And, too,
England did come to the assistance
of the Poles, even though that as
sistance was somewhat tardy.
France, anxious for a Polish
diplomatic representative to go to
Berlin, "also was deceived by
England." the Germans insist, be
cause the British "in reality had
done nothing to bring about the
negotiations on which peace or
war depended."

Summing up their indictment,
they pointed directly at the unholy
machinations of British diplomacy as
the cause for Poland's unhappy in
vasion. Because of the workings of
the English diplomats, the Poles
didn't send negotiators to Berlin
and the Polish ambassador there,
Josef Lipsky, was "not allowed to
discuss a peaceful settlement."
Hitler's sharp accusations against
the English are just one more indi
cation of the hate that Germany
holds for tlie British. Now Germany
accuses her of violating the "honor
code of international politics."
