# Timoshenko, Soviet Fugitive, Denounces Russian Tyranny
## 
### BUD AMES 
"No, I don't like Stalin, and I don't like his regime. And 1 don't know
anybody who does like him. Nobody can like a regime where they have to
string up barbed-wire to keep citizens from running out of the country."
Thus boomed the heavily accented voice of Stephen P. Timoshenko,
professor of theoretical and applied mechanics, fugitive from Russia, and

present a member of the Farm
faculty.
He was born in 1878, 61 years ago,
in the town of Kiev. That's in South
Russia about 700 miles from Mos
cow. His interest as a boy was in
the mechanical and structural, so it
was natural that he enter the ad
vanced engineering school at Peters
burg. He became a professor of en
gineering in the same city.
REVOLUTION CAME
And then came the revolution.
With the Communists came danger
for persons in the intellectual pro
fessions, so Mr. Timoshenko and his
wife, who comes from South Russia
too, fled across the border to War
i saw, the former capital of fonner
j Poland.
"Oh, yes, it was very hard to get
j out of the country," ho chatted on
j gutturally. "Our chance came dur-
I ing the Polish intervention in 1920.
We {led, but since the Polish army
was soon in retreat, it took us two
weeks to travel 400 miles to cross
the boi'der."
The next two years, until 1922,
the polite professor taught at Za
greb, the capital of Yugoslavia.
Then he moved to the United States.
In 1936 he joined the Stanford fac
ulty.
LIKES AMERICA
"Oh, yes, I like America," he said,
pondering. "But. I miss Russia. But
I never can go backâ€”fit. least not
I under the present regime."
During the war? Well, he served
in the Russian Navy as a consulting
engineer and later as a member of
the important Engineering Counsel
of the Russian Army. This work
was all out of uniform, and was
concerned with military inventions
and perfections, such as the tank.
All this for the Czar.
And the professor has written
many books on engineering in Rus
sian, English, French, and Dutch,
i SPEAKS REAL RUSSIAN
"I talk only Russian well." he con
j fvded. "That is the real Russian like
j they use in books. When 1 was in
] Russia there were no dialects like
j Ukrainian and White Russian."
As to Russia's present squabblings j
I with Finland, Mr. Timoshenko |
feels that his native land may go into !
a small war, with Finland, for ex- \
ample. But he doesn't feel that Rus- j
sia is established well enough to j
I start, a "big war."
