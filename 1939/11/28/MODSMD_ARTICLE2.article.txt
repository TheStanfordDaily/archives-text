# Soviet Radio Asks Finns To Revolt
## Moscow Observers Expect Quick Stab At Border Nation 
### 
MOSCOW, Tuesday, Nov. 28 (UP).
—The Soviet radio early today called
upon the Finnish people lo over
throw their government and "escape
the fate of Poland" after Finland's
official rejection of a Russian protest
against an alleged attack on Red
army troops by Finnish artillery.
Many observers in Moscow pre
dicted imminent action against Fin
land, asserting that Russia in the
past 24 hours has gone too far in
whipping up mass indignation
against the Finns to accept any com
promise settlement.
"If the Finns are going to force
us to act we will strike and in a
short time defeat the enemy on his
own territory," blared the radio,
quoting one of the hundreds of war
like resolutions from mass meetings
of workers, peasants and students.
HEATS SOVIET ANGER
Finland's reply—serving only to
increase Soviet anger—refused Rus
sia's demand of Sunday that all Fin
nish troops be withdrawn 12 to 15
miles back from the frontier north
of Leningrad.
The note agreed, however, to ne
gotiate a joint demilitarization of the
frontier whereby both Finnish and
Soviet troops would be pulled back.
Otherwise, it was said, there can
be no unilateral withdrawal of Fin
nish troops.
Finland's answer was delivered to
Soviet Premier and Foreign Com
missar Viacheslav M. Molotov at
12:30 a.m. by the Finnish Minister,
Baron A. A. S. Yrjoekoskinen.
Even as the two men talked at the
Kremlin the Soviet radio, in an ap
peal repeated over and over in the
Finnish language, was calling upon
the Finnish people to overthrow
their government.
ARTILLERY SILENT
Baron Yrjoekoskinen told Molotov
flatly that Finnish artillery had not
fired upon Red army troops along
the 50-mile-long Carelian Isthmus
frontier Sunday afternoon, killing
and wounding 13 officers and men, as
alleged in Molotov's ultimatum-like
protest.
As a matter of fact, the Finnish
envoy said, the Finns have no guns
at that point of the border capable
of firing into Soviet territory.
Informed quarters said that Molo
tov and Josef V. Stalin undoubtedly
will assail the Finnish reply as fur
ther evidence of Finland's alleged
"attempts to provoke war against the
Soviet Union."
