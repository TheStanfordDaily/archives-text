# Men's Council Sets Fines For Hell Week Violations; Awaits Wilbur's Approval
## Putnam Expects President's Reply By Saturday; Fraternity Control Board Marks Time on Regulations 
### 
Prosecution resulting from illegal initiation practices, allegedly com
mitted by 14 of the 25 Stanford fraternities, was completed l>y Men's Coun
cil in a decision handed down yesterday afternoon, imposing fine* and;
other penalties.
Immediately upon completion of the prosecution. Men's Council Chair
man Bob Putnam prepared the decision for release for publication. How-

.ever, it was found that the infor
mation would be delayed for public
release pending the approval of
President Ray Lyman Wilbur, now
in New York City.
ANSWER SATURDAY
Relayed by airmail to the execu
tive, an answer is not expected until
Saturday, according to Putnam.
Since Putnam chose to first obtain
Administration approval on the stu
dent governing body's decision, he
requested Acting President Edgar E.
Robinson to consider for approval
the Council's final decision. How
ever, Acting President Robinson re
ferred the situation to the attention
of President Wilbur.
OTHERS WAITING
Also awaiting announcement of
the Council's penalties, besides the
local chapters in question and the
general student body, is the Inter
fraternity Board of Control, which
postponed approval of new initia
tion period regulations for 1940 as
proposed by Interfraternity Council.
Interfraternity Board of Control
has postponed action until after
Men's Council completed its defini
tion of fraternity hazing. This, in
turn, was also delayed, together with
Men's Council's rulings on penalties
for initiation practices thus season,
by the necessity of President Wil
bur's approval of the hazing defini
tion.
JUDICIAL BODY
Men's Council is the student judi
cial body set up by the A.S.S.U.
under the provisions of the students'
constitution for self-government.
Putnam revealed that since he, as
chairman of the Council, would not
release information on the imposed
penalties until approved by Presi
dent Wilbur, he consequently did
not release information on specific
charges against the fraternities until
that time.
SOURCE UNCERTAIN
Source of the complaints to the
Administration in connection with
hazing practices during Hell Week,
resulting in punitive action by the
Council, was not obtainable.
Although punishment was believed
to have been precipitated by a se
ries of complaints to the Adminis
tration, including a rumored article
printed in a Los Angeles newspaper
describing illegal activities, it was
impossible to ascertain the c%act
source of the complaints.
