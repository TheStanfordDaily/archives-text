# Engineer Reveals Hoover War Libe, When Finished, Will Not Top Campanile
## 
### CHARLES BULL 
Forever quelling the argument as to the respective heights of Berke- I |
ley's Campanile and Stanford's Hoover Library on War, Revolution, and {
Peace, M. B. Rogers, structural engineer for the library, revealed the exact j
figures on the heights of the two edifices.
The Campanile stands 1105 feet front ground to tip, while the Hoover

Library will be 271 feet from the
ground to the top of the dome.
Of these 271 feet, 245 feet, the total
blight of the structural steel has
been erected, and the derrick and
boom are being lowered down the
side of the structure.
STUDENTS REACT
Disappointment was the general
student reaction expressed on learn
ing that Stanford's new shadow on
the skyline will not be as high as
the Berkeley spire.
"The fact that the Hoover Libe
was going to be taller than the Cam
panile was the only justification for
its construction," was the opinion of
one very concerned student.
Another interesting bit of War
Libe information just released is
that there will be a total of 43,518
rivets in the completed tower, of
which 28,000 are being pounded in
on the job, much to the distraction
of the entire campus. The rest were
installed by the Bethlehem Steel
Corp. in their fabrication of the 820
tons of steel girders at San Fran
cisco.
GOING ON SCHEDULE
All riveting will be completed
within about a week, according to
John Leavers, superintendent for the
Wagner Construction Co. He also
stated that construction is proceed
ing exactly on schedule.
Reinforcing steel is beginning to
encircle the gaunt steel girders, and
wooden frames are being put around
the girders to hold the concrete.
The concrete walls for the base
ment floor are being poured at the
rate of about 175 yards per day. The
walls of the first and basement floors
will take about 700 yards of concrete
to fill them.
The concrete being used is com
posed of large rock, small rock, sand,
cement, and water, all stored in the
large wooden building to the east
side of the building.
