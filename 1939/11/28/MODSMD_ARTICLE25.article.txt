# Police Hunt Cook-To Give Fortune
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 27 (UP).
â€”Attorneys were looking for Owen
Kenny, also known as Eugene Ken
ny, or Barney the Cook, tonight but
this time they offered him a fortune
instead of the threat of the gallows
that hung over him 33 years ago.
H. H. McPike, former United
States attorney, revealed he had re
ceived a letter from a New York
law firm asking the whereabouts of
Kenny. Kenny's brother had died
;ind left several blocks of real estate
in New York and Brooklyn. Barney
the Cook was the heir.
McPike said all trace of Barney
the Cook was lost after he ran
from a San Francisco court room
33 years ago when he was freed on
a writ of habeas corpus because
court records conecting him with the
murder of Patrick Dolan had been
destroyed in the fire and earth
quake.
