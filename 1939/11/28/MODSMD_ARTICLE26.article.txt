# Grade Envelopes Go on Sale Soon
## 
### 
Blue envelopes for the mailing of
fall quarter grades will go on sale
at a nickel apiece at the Information
window in the Administration
Building some time next week, ac
cording to an announcement made
by the Registrar's office. Benefits
from the sale of the envelopes will
go to the Convalescent Home.
Students do not necessarily have to
buy these envelopes in order to have
their grades mailed home, said Miss
Armista Cook at the Information
window. A stamped self-addressed
envelope is all that is necessary.
Grades will be mailed on Dec. 20
