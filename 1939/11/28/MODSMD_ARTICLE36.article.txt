# Indian Squad Heads East For Battle
## Card Underflows Face Favored Dartmouth Eleven on Saturday 
### JERRY BRUCKER 
Riding the rails some place be
tween here and New York, the be
draggled Indian gridders are still
looking for their first win of the
season. Odds will be high against
them when they take the lield Sat
urday against Dartmouth.
The Hanover squad, with two de
leats and a tie the only bad marks
on their eight-game slate, will be
favored to chalk up the first win for
Dartmouth in four games with Farm
teams.
Dartmouth went through their first
six games without a defeat, but on
Armistice Day they took their first
licking at the hands of the Princeton
Tigers, 9-7. A week later they were
soundly beaten by undefeated Cor
nell, 35-6. In their third game they
were held to a scoreless tie with
Navy. The high spot of the Dart
mouth season was a smashing 33-0
win over Yale.
HUTCHINSON TO PLAY
Bill Hut chinson, spectacular half
back who went on several solo
jaunts all over Stanford Stadium in
last year's game, has come through
lor Earl Blaik this season, and with
his long runs and towering kicks has
become the main backfield threat of
the Big Green team. In the line,
guard Lou Young and tackle Som
mers are standouts.
The Indians were underdogs last
year when they entered the Dart
mouth game, but came out with a
decisive 23-13 victory.
STANDLEE CARD HOPE
Stanford's hopes this year will be
pinned on the line smashing of Norm
Standlee and the erratic left arm
of Frankie Albert. If Albert con
nects with a few of his tosses as he
did in the second half of the Cal
debacle, the Cards have an outside
chance to upset the potent Dart
mouth eleven.
Tiny Thornhill may play some of
his sophomores who looked well
against the Bears. In addition to
Albert, Freddie Meyer. Doug Stahle,
Winkie Jones, Johnny Sturgeon, and
Bob Crane saw action last week,
and may play a good bit of the game
Saturday.
SOPHOMORES MAY STAR
Meyer, hampered by an injury for
a couple of weeks, snagged a couple
of passes against the Bears that set
up one touchdown and scored an
other.
It will be the first time Eastern
fans have seen Norm Standlee play
football, and if the Chief turns in
his usual game he may gain some
bids for All-American from New
York grid experts.

leats and a tie the only bad marks
on their eight-game slate, will be
favored to chalk up the first win for
Dartmouth in four games with Farm
teams.
Dartmouth went through their first
six games without a defeat, but on
Armistice Day they took their first
licking at the hands of the Princeton
Tigers, 9-7. A week later they were
soundly beaten by undefeated Cor
nell, 35-6. In their third game they
were held to a scoreless tie with
Navy. The high spot of the Dart
mouth season was a smashing 33-0
win over Yale.
HUTCHINSON TO PLAY
Bill Hut chinson, spectacular half
back who went on several solo
jaunts all over Stanford Stadium in
last year's game, has come through
lor Earl Blaik this season, and with
his long runs and towering kicks has
become the main backfield threat of
the Big Green team. In the line,
guard Lou Young and tackle Som
mers are standouts.
The Indians were underdogs last
year when they entered the Dart
mouth game, but came out with a
decisive 23-13 victory.
STANDLEE CARD HOPE
Stanford's hopes this year will be
pinned on the line smashing of Norm
Standlee and the erratic left arm
of Frankie Albert. If Albert con
nects with a few of his tosses as he
did in the second half of the Cal
debacle, the Cards have an outside
chance to upset the potent Dart
mouth eleven.
Tiny Thornhill may play some of
his sophomores who looked well
against the Bears. In addition to
Albert, Freddie Meyer. Doug Stahle,
Winkie Jones, Johnny Sturgeon, and
Bob Crane saw action last week,
and may play a good bit of the game
Saturday.
SOPHOMORES MAY STAR
Meyer, hampered by an injury for
a couple of weeks, snagged a couple
of passes against the Bears that set
up one touchdown and scored an
other.
It will be the first time Eastern
fans have seen Norm Standlee play
football, and if the Chief turns in
his usual game he may gain some
bids for All-American from New
York grid experts.
Riding the rails some place be
tween here and New York, the be
draggled Indian gridders are still
looking for their first win of the
season. Odds will be high against
them when they take the lield Sat
urday against Dartmouth.
The Hanover squad, with two de
leats and a tie the only bad marks
on their eight-game slate, will be
favored to chalk up the first win for
Dartmouth in four games with Farm
teams.
