### JERRY MAYER 
ROSE BOWL TEAM
NOT SETTLED YET
While it is taken for granted that
the winner of the Southern Cali
fornia vs. U.C.L.A. game in Los An
geles, Dec. 9, will decide the West
ern Rose Bowl nominee, it is not
an impossibility that Jan. 1, 1940,
may find Oregon State in the Tour
nament of Roses game.
While there is little doubt that the
Trojans are easily the finest team on
the Coast, especially after their .19-7
and 20-12 victories over Oregon
State and Notre Dame, respec
tively, still the official winner of the
Pacific Coast conference automatical
ly is chosen for the Rose Bowl bid—
and the Beavers can still win the
P.C.C. crown.
The Beavers have completed
their season, having a record of
five victories, one defeat, and one
tie in conference standings.
Neither U.S.C. nor U.C.L.A. has
dropped a game, but the Trojans
have one tie and the Bruins two
deadlocks to mar their conference
records. Each of the latter teams
has two more league games to play,
the Trojans against Washington
and U.C.L.A.. and the Bruins
against Washington State and
li.s.c.
One defeat would put the Bruins
below the Beavers in the league
standings, and one defeat would give
the Trojans a tie with Oregon State,
in which case U.S.C. would un
doubtedly be invited to the Bowl on
the strength of its victory over the
northerners.
At present the standings are as
follows:
W L T
U.S.C 4 ft 1
U.C.L.A 3 0 2
Oregon State 5 11
Should U.S.C. tie Washington and
lose to U.C.L.A., and the Bruins lose
to Washington State (a remote pos
sibility) and then trim the Trojans,
the standings would be as follows:

! W I, T
Oregon State 5 11
! U.C.L.A 4 1 2
i U.S.C 4 1 2
There are various possibilities
that by chance could shove the
Beavers into the Rose Bowl, but
there is little doubt in any of the
so - called "experts" minds that
U.S.C. will be facing Tennessee
come Jan. 1.
The Trojans have already scouted
the Volunteers in several games
this year, while Tennessee returned
j the compliment last Saturday at
I South Bend while the Thundering
1 Herd was defeating Notre Dame.
' CAL ROOTING SECTION
CHEERS NORM STANDLEE
When Stanford's battered Norm
Standlee dragged himself oft' the
field in the closing minutes of the
I fourth quarter last Saturday, Cal's
| rooting section gave him enthusiastic
j applause, while the Bear co-eds
| waved their pom-pons in a colorful
I and gracious salute to the Indian
! fullback.
All this despite the fact that
Standlee, playing on a bad ankle
as he was and handicapped by an
inferior line, was held down
throughout almost the entire game,
i It was a genuine tribute from a
group of rival students who re
alized that the tired Standlee had
given his all to a lost cause—only
to find that his all wasn't enough
in the face of an inspired Cal
team.
It's this kind of spirit that makes
[ the Big Game something that every
i Stanford and Cal student can look
| back upon as a long-remembered
j event of his early days. I'll always
| remember that the Berkeleyites
j cheered for a valiant Cardinal war
j rior, long after I forget who it was
that they cheered.
