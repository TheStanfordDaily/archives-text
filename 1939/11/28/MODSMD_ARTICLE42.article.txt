## 
### 
BUTTE. Mont., Nov. 27 (UP). —
Shapely Elsie Crabtree did her bit
yesterday for the Reno Professional
Football Club but even with a pair
of dimpled knees for inspiration, the
Nevada boys failed to rally.
Snuggled between a couple of
burly linemen on the Reno bench, an
abbreviated costume falling far
short of covering her much-pub
liced knees, Elsie watched her
team go down to defeat before the
Englewood club of the Butte-Ana
conda Independent League. The
score: 21 to 0.
By Haines of Washington scored
all the points in the 1935 football
game with U.S.C.—6 points for the
Huskies, 2 for the Trojans.
