MEN'S COUNCIL'S ruling on houses guilty
of violating the initiation regulations of
Interfraternity Board of Control yesterday pre
sents aspects both good and bad. In one way it
bolsters the prestige and proves the effective
ness of student government. In another it kicks
it in the face.
The fact that the Council heard all the evi
dence available on each fraternity's case, care
fully considered it, and rendered a series of
decisions demonstrates all that is best in judi
cial control of students by their peers.
But the fact that before it would release its
judgment, Men's Council sought administrative
approval—and when that was not readily avail
able, sent to President Wilbur in New York for
it—is a sad commentary on the potency and
independence of student control.
The Council is equipped to handle under
graduate discipline on the campus. And while
it does so it is not only giving excellent training
in democracy, but is building esprit de corps
among the students.
But, if every time it is forced to make a deci
sion of consequence, it is going to hide behind
the skirts of the Administration, the institution
is worthless.
Men's Council was in a constitutional position
to hand down a judgment yesterday.
It was its place to act as befits a court —not
in the role of a tool of the University Adminis
tration.
