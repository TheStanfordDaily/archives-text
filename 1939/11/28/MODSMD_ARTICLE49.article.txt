# They All Laughed
## 
### 
THE spectators laughed last Saturday when
they saw the burly policeman drag the Cal
rooter who had just hit him with a mud-ball from
the stands and escort him from the Stadium by
the collar.
They laughed because they thought that the
cop was merely throwing a scare into the kid—
and sounding a warning for the 50 other Cal
men who had pelted him with rocks, mud, or
anges, and apple cores when he reguested
them to stop disrupting the game by shooting
off firecrackers and torpedoes.
The spectators would not have laughed if
they had known that the U.C. rooter was going
to spend the night in the Palo Alto jail and was
going to be held for 5250 bail. At the time they
probably would have resented the policeman's
action as much as the California rooting section
did.
But they might have changed their minds by
the end of the game.
Berkeley students continued to shoot off
fireworks to imitate the final gun. And when
the Blue and Gold section crowded out onto
the field and tore down the goal posts three
minutes before the end of the game, alumni
and outside supporters of both universities be
came indignant.
The men responsible for this exhibition were
guilty of both stupidity and bad sportsmanship.
And they succeeded in giving another black
eye to intercollegiate football.
The Cal student who took the rap for the
whole mob will be tried in Palo Alto this after
noon.
Naturally no thinking judge is going to fine
or punish him to the extent that he will become
a martyr for a crime of which 50 men are guilty.
The action of that one rooter is insignificant;
the general conduct of the California section
is important.
Probably the effect of the trial will be to call
vividly to the attention of the administration of
the University of California and the officials of
the A.S.U.C. the destructive effect of such be
havior on the game of football.
Gate receipts for intercollegiate contests are
going down all over the United States. With
teams in the Conference cellar, Stanford and
California are taking an even harder beating
than most schools.
Even if the Big Game was not a great football
show, it could have been an exhibition of fine
sportsmanship—if the Cal rooters had wanted
to make it so.
