# Long Pants for America
## 
### 
TONIGHT four Stanford professors are going
to piece together a talk on whether there is
an American culture, and whether, in any case,
America needs a culture of her own.
That is a somewhat academic way of saying
it. What it means is: Is America as a nation
beginning to climb out of the cradle?
Yes, perfumed over with the faint aroma
which hangs about the word "culture" is this
announcement of what may be the most impor
tant program presented by the Tuesday Eve- !
ning Lecture Series this quarter.
It should be of interest to all of Stanford's j

4,000. It won't, of course, but it should, because
this lecture has potential interest for every be
ginning (and experienced) engineer, writer,
doctor, musician, teacher, and lawyer here at
Stanford.
Where, after all, did we get the phrase, "The
Great American Novel"? And why haven't we
seen the novel yet; why hasn't it been written?
If Stanford is lucky, it will hear a clue to the
answer to these questions. It will hear where
the great American novel (symphony, play)
may come from, and what it will be like. It
will hear exactly the chances open to American
men and women in professional fields.
And perhaps —perhaps—some Stanford stu
dent at that symposium may be inspired to
contribute a little to our culture from American
material.—D. J.
