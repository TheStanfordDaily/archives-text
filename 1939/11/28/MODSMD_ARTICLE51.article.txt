WHO lIATES WAR?
r pHE people should not decide whether or not the
people should go to war, we are told. It's an im
practical and foolish scheme.
And invariably the opponents of the popular-refer
endum war ballot give two contradictory reasons for
their stand. First they say that the referendum is cum
bersome; if the United States has to declare war quickly
it takes too long to get the people to act. Second,
they say that the people are easily influenced, that
propaganda will easily catapult the country into war
hysteria.
As to the first issue, everyone grants that a war of
defense—that is, defense of United States territory, and
not defense of France—should be immediate. As a
matter of fact, the constitutional fathers foresaw that
eventuality by giving the President power to com
mandeer the army and navy without a declaration of
war. But in a war on foreign soil the two arguments
against popular war-vote refute each other.
If it takes time and is cumbersome to .get the voters
to declare war, then how can the opponents of the
referendum in their second breath accuse the people of
being such easy dupes for war-propaganda?

IT IS, of course, true that we are relatively easy suck
ers for propaganda of any kind. But the only rea
sonable way to decide how readily the people would
vote for war is to compare their suggestability with
the suggestibility of Congress. It is not, unfortunately,
a question of the people versus stone-hearted judges.
When the powerful pressure-interests of the coun
try have wanted us to declare war in the past they
have had little trouble convincing Congress that they
were right. No group of American voters could have
been more feverishly hysterical than was the almighty
United States Senate in 1917. No group of American
voters could have more speedily sent American vot
ers to murder for the safety of world democracy.
The question that we must decide is how much we
really hate war, not how much propaganda the people
will swallow. If we truthfully believe that the United
States should fight only in self-defense, or if we sin
cerely believe that we should fight a foreign war only
in the most extenuating circumstances, then we should
set about to safeguard our neutrality by making it hard
to declare war. And on those grounds it must be ad
mitted that the first anti-referendum argument is per
fectly correct: it certainly will be a cumbersome job
to get the people to vote for war. But some of us
rather hope that the declaration of war will be cum
bersome, very cumbersome.
Cripples and corpses of future wars can't make
speeches in Congress. But the corpses-to-be can vote.
