## REVOLT AGAINST WAR 
### 
r I' , HE EDITOR, SIR:
We are faced, unhappily, with the utter boredom
of the European war. The only hope for the lifting of
the pall is the eventual end of first-round sparring by
belligerents and the spring release from Central Eu
ropean rain. While there is still time on our hands to
think, it. would bo interesting to consider certain phases
of America's relation to this conflict.
Of course, our leaders are steadfastly announcing
the conviction that, this time, we will not furnish the
shoulder for England and France to cry on. But since
such talk has preceded every war in which the United
States has taken part, it is becoming a little hollow.
Over on the East coast, in Boston, a group of people
are doing some talking in a different key, or at least
in a key that has singular disfavor —one might almost
say, suppression—in this land of fi*ee speech. It is the
consideration of resistance to militaristic enterprise.
>»« >1' * *
r I" , IIESE people are wondering about intensely prac
tical matters: whether a man alive is not a shade
more able to further any ideals society may call desir
able than a man dead; whether or not there isn't
homely truth in the fact that if all men of a nation do
not light, there will be no fighting; whether or not
this matter of "things worse lhan death" is not only a
mirage arising from our insistence that we will choose
which nations shall be allowed to cheat us econom
ically: being beaten in commerce by the British is an
honor, but by the Germans, an insult, or rather being
cheated by England is world trade, by the Nazis, blas
phemy on the name of the Constitution.
What will puzzle these practical philosophers most
of all is the fact that while men insist at the top of
their lungs that war is none of their pudding, they will,
when the time comes, march off with the rest of the
sheep, supposing that some natural power beyond con
trol forces them to go, and that only they, out of the
rest of the regiment, had any thoughts of sitting this
war out.
* * >!« *
r I I IIE difficulty is that most men are much too cow
ardly to refuse to go to war. They are brought up
to be little children following any piper's tune. They
have so little in the way of guts that they must mix
them on the ground with the guts of an entire infantry.
The man who stubbornly refuses to see the beauty
of a muddy de;ith for muddier principles is deprived
of the consolation of being in a crowd; he has only
himself to be proud of. And the worst of it is — the
way society runs these days —he will have to go
through it again in 25 years. The lucky man who went
to war had to go only once; a machine-gun bullet in
the head saved him a lot of worrying in the future.
This nation has so little confidence in its ideals. It
is a bully that feels he must compensate for his own
inferiority by fighting. The fact that American men
go to war is an expression of this inferiority complex,
nothing more.
This nation will probably follow in the brilliant
footsteps of England; what is muddling enough for
England is muddling enough for us!
We wre born by a Revolution against dull, tat
tered tradition. It is high time that we had another
revolt against war.

The man who stubbornly refuses to see the beauty
of a muddy de;ith for muddier principles is deprived
of the consolation of being in a crowd; he has only
himself to be proud of. And the worst of it is — the

through it again in 25 years. The lucky man who went
to war had to go only once; a machine-gun bullet in
the head saved him a lot of worrying in the future.
This nation has so little confidence in its ideals. It
is a bully that feels he must compensate for his own
inferiority by fighting. The fact that American men
go to war is an expression of this inferiority complex,
nothing more.

We are faced, unhappily, with the utter boredom
of the European war. The only hope for the lifting of
the pall is the eventual end of first-round sparring by
belligerents and the spring release from Central Eu
ropean rain. While there is still time on our hands to
think, it. would bo interesting to consider certain phases
of America's relation to this conflict.
Of course, our leaders are steadfastly announcing
the conviction that, this time, we will not furnish the
shoulder for England and France to cry on. But since
such talk has preceded every war in which the United
States has taken part, it is becoming a little hollow.
Over on the East coast, in Boston, a group of people
are doing some talking in a different key, or at least
in a key that has singular disfavor —one might almost
say, suppression—in this land of fi*ee speech. It is the
consideration of resistance to militaristic enterprise.

more able to further any ideals society may call desir
able than a man dead; whether or not there isn't
homely truth in the fact that if all men of a nation do
not light, there will be no fighting; whether or not
this matter of "things worse lhan death" is not only a
mirage arising from our insistence that we will choose
which nations shall be allowed to cheat us econom

honor, but by the Germans, an insult, or rather being
cheated by England is world trade, by the Nazis, blas
phemy on the name of the Constitution.
What will puzzle these practical philosophers most
of all is the fact that while men insist at the top of
their lungs that war is none of their pudding, they will,
when the time comes, march off with the rest of the
sheep, supposing that some natural power beyond con
