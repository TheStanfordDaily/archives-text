# Bette Davis Rings Bell Again, But Film Doesn't
## 
### 
"THE PRIVATE LIVES OI ELIZABETH AND ESSEX," now playing
at the Fox Stanford.
Bette Davis turns in another line acting performance in Warner Broth
ers' Jatest historical costume spectacle. Playing the part of the aging
Queen Elizabeth torn between her love for the young and impetuous Earl

of Essex and her desire to rule Eng- (
land well, Miss Davis further estab
lishes herself as the greatest actress
on the screen.
In unfortunate contrast, Errol
Flynn is a not-too-inspired Essex.
In a few scenes, especially those near
the end of the picture, Flynn shows
some of the fire that made him a
star, but. on the whole his perform
ance leaves something to be de
sired.
Olivia De Havilland, cast as Lady
Penelope Grey, is the top supporting
player. In the role of one of the
Queen's ladies-in-waiting who is
also in love with Essex, Miss De
Havilland gets the most out of her
part, although it is definitely sec
ondary to the plot.
The most, impressive scene of the
picture is the last, when Elizabeth
sits enthroned in a dark stone room
of the Tower of London listening to
the crescendo of drums that tell her
of her lover's execution.
Filmed in technicolor, the epic
was directed by Michael Curtiz. The
sets and costumes were good, but
the color was a little disappointing.
Experts explain the lack of clarity
in interior scenes by the fact that
infra-red light is not present.
Some of the credit for Miss Davis'
triumph must go to Perc Westmore,
who did the make-up. The picture
was based on the stage play by Max
well Anderson.
All in all, "Elizabeth and Essex"
is well worth seeing, but it is not
the best picture of the year. â€”
