# Brazilian Star Wins Audience
## Bidu Sayao Displays Promise in Concert 
### PAT SMITH 
Thunderous applause which 'called
for seven encores quite adequately
told what her Stanford audience
thought of Senorita Bidu Sayao, last
night.
More than average personal charm,
the crown jewels of Brazil, and a
voice that gives promise of some j
day rivaling the finest of her gen- j
oration, combined to make Miss
Sayao one of the most sparkling art
ists to appear here in some time.
Though apparently a little ill at
ease early in the evening, the lovely
Brazilian very soon warmed to her
task. Her first real hit came at the
end of the first group of songs when
she substituted the popular "Alle
lluia" by Mozart for the queen's aria
from "The Magic Flute."
Miss Sayao did not hesitate to
choose the aria "Caro Nome" from
Verdi's "Rigoletto," which a good
portion of her audience had heard
Lily Pons sing during the San Fran
cisco opera season. She suffered not J
at all from the comparison, although j
lacking a little of the polish of her |
more experienced rival.
High spot of the concert came, of !
course, with the two selections from j
Massenet's "Manon" in which she
made her triumphant debut in San
Francisco in this season's opener, j
The sentimental aria "Adieu, notre J
petite table" and the gay gavotte
from the festival scene gave Miss j
Sayao every opportunity to display j
her versatility, dramatic talent, and !
charming voice.
