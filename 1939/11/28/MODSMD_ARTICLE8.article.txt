# Red Cross Opens Drive Next Week
## Campus Workers To Canvass Row, Halls Beginning Tuesday 
### 
The annual Stanford Red Cross
Drive, under the direction of a
Cardinals committee headed by co-
Chairmen Mary Kay Horton and
Bob Beckham, will take place next
Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thurs
day, when workers will solicit con
tributions in campus living groups.
The money is raised in co-opera
tion with the Palo Alto Chapter of
the Red Cross as a part of the an
nual nationwide drive, Miss Horton
stated. Half is used in the local
humanitarian work of the organiza
tion and the other half becomes a
part of the national fund.
Stanford has always taken an ac
tive part in the annual Red Cross
Drive, last year raising over $1000
for the fund. The project depends
entirely on individual support, and
is not subsidized by any group, it
was pointed out.
WORKERS TO MEET
Drive workers will meet next
Monday afternoon in the Nitery at 5
o'clock for final instructions. The
drive will begin officially with an
