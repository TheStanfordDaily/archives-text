BROWN I E
I've collected a happy array of
beautiful things for you at
Brown's. Such unique Christ
mas Gifts you would have to
travel the world to find, for I
have been collecting them for
you from international sources.
These are terra cotta angels
from my heavenly collection of
a thousand immortal figurines.
They have white glazed robes.
Some hold choir books, some
hold candles and some just
pray. They make excellent gifts,
table decorations and flower ar
rangement props. They were
made in Berkeley
by Kay, The Potter. j^\\
This tiny cherub is
hand carved from
wood, brightly lac
quered and very
joyous.
The plate and mug are from
a limited supply of imported
Amalfi pottery in richly col
ored, ship designs.
Platters, luncheon and dinner
plates, cups, saucers, bowls,
and salad bowls make a tempt
ing list. Cups
and saucers are (tN-V
only $1.15, din- y
ner plates $1.00, "WB*
and large fruit O ,
bowls $3.40, to I \JmV
give you an idea \
of the prices.
I have a whole zoological gar
den of cute, tiny animals to de
light a Christmas heart. There
are fuzzy coons, rabbits, badg-;
ers; glass doxies, deer, pen
guins; and glazed ducks, cats,
doggies.
Next week I'll tell you about I
our Toys.
