### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
|> Y the first of winter quarter there j
may be no independent, neutral j
Finland.
Russia denounced her nun-aggres
sion treaty with the Finns and ma
chine gun and artillery fighting
flared along the border. The Red
Army has orders to annihilate the
Finnish troops if further "provoca- i
tions" occur. And, when Stanford !
treks back to the Reservation in
January, a month from now, Fin
land's independence may be gone,
just as that of Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania. Poland, too, learned what
it meant to oppose a conquest
hungry Stalin and Hitler.

In London the English are going
ahead with their plans to seize
German exports as well as im
ports. Cry as (hey may, the neu
tral European nations can't shake
Britain's determination to wreck
German foreign exchange — and
Chamberlain's blows must be swift,
for English commerce is taking a
tremendous beating at the hands
of German subs, mines, and pocket
cruisers.
Berlin reports that the U-boat
commander who sank the Royal Oak
has wrecked a 10,000-ton British
cruiser off the Shetlands, with a loss
of 700 persons.
IN Washington the Dies committee
continues its insane, publicity
mad investigations while intelligent
America wonders at the caliber of
its legislators.
Some Yale boys and "townics"
tried to overturn a car containing
Communist Party Secretary Earl
Rrowder after lie spoke on the
New Haven campus under the aus
pices of the Peace Council. As he
spoke the crowd shouted "Viva
Hitler" and "Go back to Moscow"
and some of them tossed pennies.
In a couple of weeks Stanford will
go home for Christmas holidays. All
over the world people will be cele
brating Christmas—some of them in
trenches, in bomb shelters, in dark
ened cities where searchlights sweep
the skies. Santa Claus and his rein
deer will have a tough time in that
sky. Maybe they'll be able to man
age it, though.
On Oct. 14, the New Yorker, our
eminent contemporary, spoke a
little of History. This is what
"Talk of the Town" had to say:
44 W/E saw a man off the other day,
on his way to be a war corre
spondent in Europe, on his way to
keep a rendezvous with History.
Where, we wanted to ask him, do you
expect to meet this dame? How are
you going to recognize her when
you do? Mr. Ernest Hemingway, an
old beau of hers, thought he recog
nized her in Spain, disguised as the
basic conflict between Fascism and
Communism. He had the wrong girl.
Many have claimed they saw her in
Moscow, a red angel of salvation.
This apparently was a mistake, too.
Within two years, she has turned up
in Vienna, Munich, Prague, and Dan
zig, but few of the correspondents
present on these occasions recog
nized her very clearly. They saw
something hurrying through the fog,
but whether it was History and what
she was up to was any man's guess.
She is sure to be around again soon
—at the West Wall, or in Switzer
land, Belgium, or even Italy. She
may, in fact, show up practically
anywhere, and in any disguise. It
is going to be very hard to catch her
for an interview. This is not the
History that used to love to jump
up on Richard Harding Davis' lap
and whisper in his car. This is an
other girl altogether."
