# TEAM LOSES, SHINES SCARCE
## 
### BUD AMES 
The shoe-shine business has hit \
bed rock. And Gus Richards, the
negro shine-man in Enema's base- i
ment, blames the drop in business on
the football team. What next?
"The fellow* arc si ill here, there's
plenty of luxury floating around, but
ever since four years ago when our
football teams started to get bad,
my business has sure gotten worse," ;
Gus said with an authoritative shake
of the head.
GOOD OLI) DAYS
And Gus should know. lie ram
bled on of "his good old days" when
he used to put a glow on 75 or 80 !
pairs of shoes a day, and make
about $12 a day. Now, that's all he
makes in a week.
Gus came to the Farm in 1919 from
a barber shop in San Francisco's ,
Mission district. He picked up his j
two-chair stand—which he says is
40 years old—and his chair cushions
in Palo Alto for SlO. The equipment
is the same today, even to the worn
cushions, except that the old red-
I wood footrests were replaced in '28
' by an oak set.
Biggest day in Gus's shiny life (
I was back in '28—before the crash,
. brother—when he took in $28 the 1
I day of a campus jolly-up. •
WANTS JALOPY
"That was when they held the '
dances on this end of the campus," j
| he mumbled in the best Southern !
j style. "Since they've moved tl 1 |
1 dances up around the Women's Gym. |
' I he slack has been something aw
i ful."
j Big item on Gus's debit list are the

magazines and newspapers he has to I
buy to keep potential customers |
hanging around the stand long |
enough for Gus to trap them.
"And I spend a lot of money on j
the bus to and from the campus. If j
things ever pick up—there was a |
sickening pause —well, I'm going to •
get me a jalopy."
And for you hoarders, Gus sends j
this sage advice on shining shoes, j
First clean, apply shoe dress—Gus I
mixes his own; shoe dressing, of |
course —clean, dry, and then apply i
the wax paste. After that, go to j
Gus for a good shine.
And Gus — love his heart — !
has dreams, haven't, we all? He i
doesn't wish for a wife. Oh, no! His !
heart lies in a San Francisco equip
ment shop and a nifty three-chair
stand with chrome-metal chairs.
Until then—?
"Boy, I sure wish I could think up
some scheme to get people down
here, just close to my stand."
And he was off to the door again,
with a flick of his brown, orange
spotted hat, for another spit.
