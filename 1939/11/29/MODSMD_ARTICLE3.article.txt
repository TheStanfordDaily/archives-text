# Excom Plans Fund Drive By Students
## Couples to Canvass Local Alumni For Annual Contribution 
### 
A vast hierarchy of student cam
paigners will canvass local alumni
next February soliciting contribu
tions for the Stanford Fund Appeal,
according to a program approved
unanimously by Ex Committee last
night.
Members approved the fund-so
liciting machine as outlined by Mol
lie West and Barney Ferguson. It
included provision for a chairman,
four sub-chairmen (to compose the
"Stanford Family Council") 16
"aides," and 160 "callers," who will;
do the actual collecting.
The whole program will be called
"The Stanford Family Call," accord
ing to the suggestion of Ferguson,
who said other names considered
had been "Indian Call" and "Co-or
dinating Committee to Solicit
Funds."
Couples making up the 160 call-;
ers will canvass alumni in Santa
Clara and San Mateo Counties, it
was explained. This will mean
about 2000 call, it was estimated.
With each man-woman pair re
sponsible for a certain area, money
wli lbe checked in at the A.S.S.U.
office, as in the case in the Con
valescent Home Drive.
President Ken Cuthbertson ex
plained that student solicitation for
the Fund Appeal will be on trial
this year, before it is put into the
by-laws and becomes a regular
function of the student body.
Other Ex Committee business fol
lows:
MEN'S GUIDANCE: Stanford men
need some sort of vocational guid
ance program similar to the one
that operates for the women, it was
concluded, as members discussed a
proposal from the Dean of Men's of
fice that Ex Committee help plan
such a program.
Although one problem appeared to j
be who would pay for such a proj- I
ect, it was felt that arousing inter- j
est would be.* a big service that would i
cost little.
John Partridge said he thought the j
chief problem was "getting the frosh I
to worry now about what they want j
to do for a living instead of waiting
until they're juniors and seniors."
Partridge and Student Manager
John Cobbs both declared that the
administration ought to take a part
in vocational guidance for the men.
Cuthbertson explained that such
j proposals always ran into the con-
I flict between educators who think a
university should give a liberal edu
cation to graduates and then let
them find their own jobs.
PEACE MOVEMENT: Whether
Stanfordites are interested in the
problem of world peace was argued
back and forth as members dis
cussed a proposal that a peace com
mittee put on a year-long program
this year instead of preparing for
j only a spring Peace Day program.
Cobbs said a peace program
"would fall into disrepute if we
I handed it over 1o one outfit, such as
! the American Student Union or the
j International Relations Club."
There are plenty of students in
terested to have a group start put
ting a meetings and forums on
peace, acording to Coline Upshaw.
"Putting it. off until April is wait
| ing too long," she said. "We are too
I satisfied with our own little world
land need to think about what's go
i ing on outside."
