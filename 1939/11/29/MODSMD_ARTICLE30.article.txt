# Oregon Beavers Can Slop Erosion
## 
### 
SALEM, Ore., Nov. 28 (UP).—The I
Oregon Slate Supreme Court today
ruled that Oregon Beavers — the
i'urry kind, not the football team—
can build erosion control damt al- |
most at will, and probably better t
than most humans.
The court's ruling came in the
case of Lloyd L. Johnson vs. Paid i

Stewart, from Harney County. John
son charged that Stewart had built
rock dams—and finally beaver dams
—on a stream above his home, and
had violated a 1925 adjudication of
water rights.
Testimony showed that the beav
ers, in two years, had done more to
check erosion than Stewart had in
ten years of building rock dams.
