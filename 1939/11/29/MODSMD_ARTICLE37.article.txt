# U.S. Culture Unappreciated, Say Speakers
## Professors Discuss American Society At Tuesday Lecture 
### 
Professors Craig, Allen, Heffner,
and White squubbled delightedly
over the question, "Is There an
American Culture?" for the Tuesday
Evening Series audience last night.
The concensus seemed to be that
there is an American culture, that
il is not appreciated in its own back
yard and, therefore, is in some dan
ger of being dumped out with the
trash.
Americans have a loose-jointed,
casual society with no conception of
the modern all-powerful sovereign
state. "We Americans are the only
really medieval people left, in the
world today," gloated historian Lynn
T. White, Jr.
Musician Warren D. Allen accused
Americans of a high-falutin' cul
ture complex. "Coffee, beer, and re
ligious devotion have always been
compartible in great music," he
smiled.
The "celophane-wrapped 99.44 per
cent pure" culture presented by
school teachers is anaemic, opined
Hubert C. Heffner, professor of dra
matic literature. True culture must
grow out of the crude ore of living
America.
The handsome cities which stand
in the place of the rude and plain
country towns of 40 or 50 years ago
are a justification of the faith the
people of the 1890's placed in edu
cation and culture. But culture as a
manner of living must be developed
out of the humanistic studies, philos
ophised Hardin Craig, professor of
English.
