# New Defense Program May Increase Army
## Other Expenditures Would Be Slashed To Meet High Cost 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 28 (UP).â€” !
The Administration's new national j
defense program probably will rec- :
ommend an increase in the per- j
sonnel of the army but not to the j
authorized peace-time strength of j
280,000, Congressional leaders indi- j
cated tonight.
Under a proclamation issued in the
state of limited emergency which he
declared soon after outbreak of the
European war, President Roosevelt
ordered the army strength brought
to 227,000, an increase of 25,000 from
its previous force.
Secretary of War Harry Woodring
and General John J. Pershing have
urged since the army be raised to
its authorized peace-time strength.
OPPOSITION EXPECTED
Preliminary soundings by Demo
cratic leaders, however, revealed
considerable existing and potential
opposition to such a move. One of
them said tonight the Administra
tion was not expected to recommend
it, and doubted it would go through
the appropriation committees of the
two houses if it is proposed.
There are ample indications the
national defense budget, expected to
reach a peace-time high of $2,200,-
000,000, will be examined carefully
before Congress approves it. This
will be doubly true if the legisla
tors are asked to vote new taxes to
defray part of the bulge of defense
spending during the coming fiscal
year over that of the current year.
RATIONAL PROGRAM'
Rumblings of displeasure already
are being heard. Senator Alva Ad
ams, D., Colo., a power on the Sen
ate Appropriations Committee, in-
I sisted on a "rational program" be
' fore departing for home.
He agreed wholeheartedly with
the President's plan to reduce other
federal expenditures to meet the in
creased cost of national defense. He
is determined to hold the coming re
lief appropriation bill to a maximum
of $1,000,000,000 and will drive for
an even lower figure if the current
business upswing continues.
