BERLIN, Nov. 28 (UP).—A young
Nazi commander who took his Ü
boat into Scapa Flow and sank the
British battleship Royal Oak on
Oct. 14 has torpedoed and "de
stroyed" a 10,000-ton British cruiser
with an estimated loss of 700 lives,
Nazis announced tonight.
The High Command announced
blond and rosy-cheeked Commander
Guenther Prien returned to the vi
cinity of his previous daring exploit
to attack the cruiser in the North
Atlantic.
Commander Prien's new blow at
the British fleet brings to 1,510 the
number of lives taken by his tor
pedoes in two attacks, assuming 700
perished on the cruiser.
650 CREW ABOARD
His new victim, the announcement
said, was of the London type—either
the Shropshire, Sussex, Devonshire
or the* London — which normally
carry crews of about 650 officers and
men.
The cruiser was said to have been
wrecked east of the Shetland Islands
oft the northern tip of Scotland.
The cruiser, according to the Nazis,
is the tenth British warship lost by
the British in the war at sea. The
ten sinkings have taken an estimated
toll of 2,400 lives.
The announcement of the 32-year
old commander's second feat came
as Nazi officials and the press boasted
the British fleet has been "driven
from the North Sea and the North
Atlantic" and Britain had suffered a
major blow in the sinking of the
converted warship Rawalpindi.
RAWALPINDI BURNED
The British Admiralty revealed
Monday night the Rawalpindi, a
passenger liner before being armed,
had gone down in flames last Thurs
day night off the Iceland coast after
a battle with the sea-raiding Nazi

pocket battleship Deutschland and
another German warship.
Hie Shetland Islands, where the
British cruiser was said to have been
torpedoed, are only a short distance
north of the Orkneys where Com
mander Prien quietly nosed,his sub
marine through the maze of mines
and nets protecting the Scapa Flow
naval base on the morning of Oct. 14
and sent torpedoes smashing into
the Royal Oak, sinking it.
As on the previous occasion, Com
mander Prien brought his U-boat
and crew safely back to their Kiel
base, it was stated.
