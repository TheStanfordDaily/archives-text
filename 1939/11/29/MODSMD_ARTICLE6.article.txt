# Cardinals Map Charity Drive
## Red Cross Workers To Start Next Week 
### 
The annual Red Cross Drive will j
reach the campus next week, open- j
ing officially on Monday night with \
announcements in all campus living !
groups and continuing through .
Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. ;
Mary Kay Horton and Bob Beck- '
ham, co-chairmen of the Cardinals j
committee conducting the drive, j
announced yesterday.
The fund is raised enti re 1y !
through individual contributions]
collected in living groups by drive
workers. Explaining that no group
quotas are set and that the fund is
not subsidized by any group, Beck- j
ham stated. "Most people like to j
give, and we believe it will be pos- j
sible to equal our contribution of
$1,000 raised last year without fore- 1
ing anyone to give who is not will
ing to do so freely and gladly."
All funds collected on the campus
pass through the Palo Alto Chapter
of the Red Cross. Half goes to the
national Red Cross for use in its
disaster and emergency relief pro
gram and half remains for use by
I the local branch.
The drive is in co-operation with
I the campaign conducted on a na-~
t ion wide scale by the Red Cross two
I weeks ago but postponed on the cam
pus because of the conflict with Big
Game preparations.
"Because of our excellent show
ing la Ft year, the Palo Alto Chapter
has been extremely co-operative in
allowing us 1o hold the drive on the
campus at this time," Beckham ex
plained.
