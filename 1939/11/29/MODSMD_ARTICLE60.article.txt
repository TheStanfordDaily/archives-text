# Delay Proposed In '40 Campaign
## Plan Still Tentative, Party Chairmen Told 
### 
WAI?M SPRINGS, Ga„ Nov. 28
(UP). —Proposals for a brief post
ponement of the 1940 Republican
and Democratic conventions have
entered several recent discussions in
which President Roosevelt has taken
part, informed sources disclosed to
night.
Presenting no intimation that the
proposals had any bearing on the
possibility that Mr. Roosevelt might
seek a third term, the sources said
several recent White House callers
had talked over the subject with the
President.
Under the plan, the 1940 conven
tions by which Republicans and
Democrats nominate presidential
candidates would be postponed a
month or a month and one-half.
The informed sources termed
"pipe dreams" a suggestion that
such a postponement might give Mr.
Roosevelt firmer control over Con
gress in an election year. The plan,
they said, still was highly tentative.
They doubted that it had yet been
placed before John D. M. Hamilton
or James A. Farley, national chair
men of the Republican and Demo
cratic national committees. The idea
behind the proposal, they said, is to
make the 1940 campaign short and
sv/eet, to save money for national
committees, and to avoid boring the
country with a protracted campaign
from June until November during a
time of international crisis.
In 1932, it was pointed out, Mr.
Roosevelt began his national cam
paign tour shortly after Sept. 1. and
did not begin his swing in 1930 until
Sept. 30, in both cases a consider
able time after winning the nomi
nation.
Disclosure of Mr. Roosevelt's dis
cussion of convention plans came
amid other evidence that the Presi
dent, was keenly aware of the polit
ical implications of his position as
leader of the party.
