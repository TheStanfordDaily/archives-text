## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 2S (UP).—Charles M. Kearney, Morrill, Neb.,
president of the National Beet Growers Association, today told the tenth
annual meeting of the group no sugar shortage exists in the United States
despite reports of such a shortage since the outbreak «f the European war.
"In a few isolated instances a temporary shortage may have occurred
because slocks of wholesalers and retailers have been low since the quota

has been in effect, bul the
■ fact is there was and is no shortage
lof sugar .supplies in the United
i States," Kearney said.
j SUGAR PRICE LOW
I "One incontrovertible proof of this
j is demonstrated by the punishingly
low price of sugar in recent years,
i Again, consumers of sugar in the
; United States still remember their
! experiences during the World War
i when sugar was rationed and later
when Continental beet sugar pro
ducers had sold all their sugar and
I overseas producers pushed up prices
: as much as 10 and 15 cents a pound."
Kearney, in his annual report to
the organization, described the asso
ciation's fight against the Cuban
trade pact before the Committee for
! Reciprocity Information.
"The proclamation of the President
J Sept. 11, 1939, wherein he 'found
! and proclaimed that a national
emergency existed with respect to
sugar' and suspended the operation
of Title II of the Sugar Act of 1937,
further complicated the Cuban tariff
! situation," Kearney said.
BEET FARMERS PUZZLED
"This action left the tax on sugar
|as it was. The Secretary of Agricul-
I ture subsequently announced no
, program and no conditional pay
t merits for the 1940 crop were in effect
nor contemplated. That makes for
an intolerable situation for our sugar
beet farmers. The farmers of our
I irrigated valleys of the West have
! done nothing to bring about a situa
j tion such as now exists and some of
I us are in a fog about it all and
j about where we go from here."
"We must insistently urge national
1 action to help shield all agriculture
from the full impact of the world
j wide situation."
Twenty - five representatives of
I eight states attended the conference.
California, Idaho, Utah, Montana,
Wyoming, Colorado, Nebraska and
South Dakota sent delegations and
Oregon and Washington were ask
ing for membership.
