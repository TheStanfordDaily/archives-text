### JERKY MAYER 
THE MEN WIIO MADE
THE SPORTS PAGE
With today's paper, The Daily
folds for the quarter and all the
little men who run in and out of
the sports office spread to the far
cornel's of the campus to do stupidly
conventional things—such as study
ing.
However, FRANK GUTHRIE, as
sistant sports editor, who has been
alternating between the varsity
football and varsity soccer beats with
JERRY PRUCKER, will start con
centrating on becoming a hurdler
for Coach Bill Elllington's track
team. Frank was sports editor of
the Santa Ana J.C. paper before
transferring to Stanford.
CHUCK SMITH, who gave de
tailed day-to-day reports on the
progress of the frosh football
team, is a candidate for Coach
Everett Dean's basketball team,
while 808 LOW will turn his
entire attention to tennis, a game
which he plays as well as he writes
about it.
JERRY BRUCKER handled the
Varsity football and soccer beats
with 'Guthrie in a clever, inter
esting style. He was the "Old
Faithful" of the sports stall' and
his typewriter geysered forth ream
after ream of good copy.
DOUGLAS GUY, former editor of
the San Mateo J.C. paper, covered
varsity w;?ter polo in a breezy, in
teresting style and tried to convince
readers that Stanford's third-place
outfit was a "Wonder Team."
JACK DALTON (Curse you, Jack
Dal ton) entertained the staff with
his Oklahoma drawl and he inciden
tally wrote stories about the frosh
soccer team that failed to win a
game, which is an achievement in
itself.
Handling the most thankless
beat on the entire paper, DON
SKLBY, second-string frosh lull
back to Milt Vucinich, tirelessly
covered intramural sports for
page 3.
MIKE NEAL, a transfer from
the University of Michigan, gath
ered news on both the horse polo
and frosh water polo outfits, and
in between strokes on his type
writer mumbled with dreamy eyes
of the vast superiority of "thos?
places along the highway" com
pared with Ann Arbor's.
HAP EVERETT took care of the
out - of - season sports, track and
basketball, and at odd times made
enemies by tooting a horn in the
Stanford band.
PAT NOWELL covered the novice
boxing tournament and will go on
next quarter with the boxing team.
Contrary to popular belief, Pat is not
a member of the boxing team.
There you are, men, exposed in
your true colors. You're on your
own now.
SENIORS FINALLY SEE
CARDS SCORE ON BEARS
Stanford seniors who watched
their last Big Game from the root
ing section last Saturday can get

' some consolation from the defeat in
that they finally saw Stanford score
a touchdown against the Bears.
When the present crop of sen
iors were frosh, California blank
ed the Cards 20-0. Then followed
l.'l-0 and <5-0 victories for the hoys
aero s the Bay.
So. thanks to the passing arm of
Frank Albert, Stanford's seniors
finally got to see the Indians ring
up a touchdown in the Big Game. |
BUT, they never did get to have the
thrill ol raising their glasses in
toast of a victorious Stanford team. 1
DISASTROUS QUARTER
FOR INDIAN ATHLETES
Perhaps no quarter in the history
of the school has presented such a
dismal record in athletics as this
• past quarter.
. Only the frosh football and var- ,
sity soccer teams were able to win |
! more games than they lost.
The Papoose gridders dropped but
i one game, a one-point verdict to the !
; U.S.C. Trobabes, and they ended j
I their season with a thrilling 13-0 |
j victory over the Calbabes.
The varsity hooters have drop
! ped three games, with two more j
I left to play, and they boast a vie- |
: tory and a tie with their California
i arch-rivals.
But in every other sport the i
Cards have taken it on the chin.
The football team hasn't won a
game.
The water polo team split with
i California in two games, but (in- j
ished iin next to last place in the
: standings.
The frosh water dogs dropped six |
; out of seven encounters, including
' two to the Bearcubs.
The frosh soccer team didn't break
into the victory column once in the !
entire season.
I The polo team won but a single I
1 game, being defeated consistently by
! large scores.
Even the fencing team didn't have
a successful autumn quarter record.

A hard head often goes along
j with a soft heart.
