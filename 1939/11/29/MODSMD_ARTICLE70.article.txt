# Casaba Positions Still Wide Open, Mentor Says
## 
### 
Only two men are sure of starting
positions when the basketball team
meets S.F.U. Friday night in the
local gym.
Kenny Davidson, a regular hist
year, will start the game at one of
the guard spots, and Don Burness
will probably open at center. Bur
ness was out for a great part of the
1939 season and has missed some
scrimmages this fall because of a
bad knee; but he will be in there
against the Dons for at least part of
the game.

The other positions arc wide open j
with several candidates fighting for
each berth and Coach Everett Dean
will not decide definitely on his
starting team until tomorrow or
Friday. Bill Cowden, Bob Penn,
Don Williams, Forest Anderson, and
Gil Rahn will see plenty of action

for Dean wants to get an idea of<
what the newcomers can do under
fire.
Fair and Porter will open at for
wards for S.F.U., Burman will be
at center, and Porter and O'Malley
will hold down the guard spots.
The Stanford frosh will start oft
their season with a game against the
S.F.U. frosh on Saturday, Dec. 2.
Jack Dana and Don Hall are sched
uled to be at forwards in a tentative
line-up released by Coach Beeb Lee
yesterday, with Ed Voss at center,
and Leo McCaffrey and Jack Eickle
man at guards.

It's hard to give a girl some
thing who's "got everything."
