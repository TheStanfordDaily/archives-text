### JERRY BUUCKER 
According to a special Daily correspondent with the Indian grrddcrs on
their transcontinental crusade, Coach Tiny ThornhilTs tentative starting
lineup against the (»rccn Indians of Dartmouth will he made up of eight
men playing their first season of varsity hall and three juniors.
Stan <«ralf, Mill Braheny, and Norm Standlec are slated to he the only
juniors on the Card eleven that will face Earl Blaik's crew at kick-oil' time

next Saturday afternoon in the Polo
Grounds.
The opening lineup, as it stand's
now, will have Graft' at left end.
Winkie Jones at left tackle, Braheny
at It-It guard, Doug Stable at center,
Ken Robesky at right guard, Swede
Johansen at right tackle, Freddie
Meyer at right end, Bob Crane at
quarter, Frankie Albert at left half,
Johnny Sturgeon at right half, and
Standlee at full.
ANDERSEN BENCHED
Robesky and Johansen are juniors
academically, but Jones, Stable,
Meyer, Crane, Albert and Sturgeon
played together On last year's un
defuated and untied Papoose eleven.
The shakeup will find Captain Stan
Andersen watching the opening
kickoff from the bench for the first
time this season. With Andersen on
the bench will be Jim Vcrdieck,
Andy Stojkovich and Hamp Pool.
STURGEON POLISHED
Albert and Meyer evidently won
their starting jobs because of their
passing demonstration in the fourth
quarter of the Cal game. Although

Sturgeon doesn't weigh over IGS
pounds, he is considered the most
polished blocking back on the In
dian squad, and i.s also an able pa;.s
snatcher.
Winkie Jones hasn't seen a great
deal of action this season, playing 1
behind Captain Andersen, but the j
big 22,')-pounder plays good ball 1
when he does get in.
Stable has shown a lot ol promise I
in the last few games, after working i
up from the third string pivot post..
Bob "Crunch" Crane got bis first '
real chance in the U.S.C. game, and
started the Washington State game
while Gene Coldiron was on the
bench with a bad knee.
