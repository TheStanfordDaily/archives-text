# Rooter Free; Judge Flays Cal Section
## 'Entire U.C. Group Guilty,' Claims Judge At Student's Trial 
### 
Asserting that one individual could
not be punished for misbehavior in
volving many, Judge Edward E.
Hardy yesterday dismissed Frank
Richer, University of California stu
dent charged with assault at Satur
day's Big Game, with a fine of $1,
which was suspended.
Present at the trial was James
Keene, president of the University
of California student body. Judge
Hardy dismissed Riebcr with the
understanding that Keene would do
everything in his power to assure
sportsmanlike conduct on the part
of Cal at future football games.
"It isn't a question of the guilt
of one individual—there is a much
larger issue involved," Judge Hardy
told Keene. "The California root
ing section is losing sight of the
purpose behind intercollegiate ath- !
I letics."
SPORTSMANSHIP
"That purpose is sportsmanship— i
not only by team members, but by |
rooting sections and spectators as!
i well. It it not fitting that the stu- j
I dents of two respected institutions |
[such as California and Stanford
j should bring the south-of-Markct
tactics customary to Kezar to a
traditional rivalry such as the Big j
Game.
"I sincerely hope that members of
the California rooting section are
ashamed of themselves—as well they
should be," the judge continued. "I
! have talked with various California ]
! alumni since the game, and they ;
j have all been truly disgusted with |
I the conduct of the students repre- j
' senting their institution."
DEMONSTRATION PLANNED
Interviewed after the trial, the j
I judge expressed the opinion that
i the demonstration would have taken
| place even if Cal had been only one
j touchdown ahead.
I .."Members of the stadium police
I heard California rooters planning to
'get. the goal pasts after this next
| play.' If tht? situation had been dif-*<
ferent, and Stanford had come from
behind in those last seconds, it
would have made a farce of the Big
Game," the judge declared.
"Such conduct is liable to become
much more serious if allowed to
continue. The next time, in an ef
fort to outdo their predecessors,
rooters may disrupt the game five
or even ten minutes before the
game ends.
"Under those circumstances, Uni
versity officials certainly could not
allow the rivalry to continue, and
we would have amateur football, as
exemplified by these two institu
tions, abolished.
"Semi-professional and profes
sional rooting tactics certainly have
no place in the relations of Stan
ford and California, although it is
regrettable that certain other local
institutions have allowed this type
of conduct to run rampant at their
football games," Judge Hardy con
cluded.
