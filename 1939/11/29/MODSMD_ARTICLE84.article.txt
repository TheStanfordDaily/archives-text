And Liberty, America's five-cent magazine
bargain, sells out another issue.
Of course the readers, duped by a mislead
ing title and a salacious illustration into think
ing they're going to get a thrill, are disap
pointed when they read the article. It isn t
really very sexy at all. But Liberty is careful
to write in a manner which leaves plenty of
room for inference, and that's almost as much
fun.
Healthy Bernarr Macfadden has a fine time
making lots of money. The readers of America
have a better time avidly gathering the drop
pings from his matchless brain. And the vic
tims he enthusiastically exposes once each
week can go chase themselves until he needs
them to sell out another issue.
Liberty's circulation is one of the largest in
America. The huge numbers who weekly read
the magazine constitute an important part of
the nation's opinion, despite the fact that indi
vidually their thoughts aren't exactly collectors'
items. Their opinion of college women is also
their opinion of universities, since college
women, football, and Communist professors
seem to be the only aspects of college life that
ever get any publicity.
Actually, university morals are the highest
for any group in the country with the possible
exception of ministers and church workers. The
clean records on Wassermann tests made
among college students as compared to the
record of the public support the high standard
of collegiate morals indisputably.
But Liberty never has been particularly in
terested in truth. Mr. Macfadden, the crusader
against vice, crime, liberalism, conservatism,
et al., is a smart publisher. He knows that the
word "college" placed in juxtaposition to the
word "morals" on the cover of his publications
will skyrocket circulation. Palo Alto's magazine
vendors demonstrated his wisdom by revealing
that the "college morals" number is the only
issue of Liberty to sell out in months.
So the universities are put on the block sim
ply to please a grasping old man, and America
can pay several million nickels and read all
about it in 8 minutes 55 seconds.—J. B.

And Liberty, America's five-cent magazine
bargain, sells out another issue.
Of course the readers, duped by a mislead
ing title and a salacious illustration into think
ing they're going to get a thrill, are disap
pointed when they read the article. It isn t
really very sexy at all. But Liberty is careful
to write in a manner which leaves plenty of
room for inference, and that's almost as much
fun.
Healthy Bernarr Macfadden has a fine time
making lots of money. The readers of America
have a better time avidly gathering the drop
pings from his matchless brain. And the vic
tims he enthusiastically exposes once each
week can go chase themselves until he needs
them to sell out another issue.
Liberty's circulation is one of the largest in
America. The huge numbers who weekly read
the magazine constitute an important part of
the nation's opinion, despite the fact that indi
vidually their thoughts aren't exactly collectors'
items. Their opinion of college women is also
their opinion of universities, since college
women, football, and Communist professors
seem to be the only aspects of college life that
ever get any publicity.
Actually, university morals are the highest
for any group in the country with the possible
exception of ministers and church workers. The
clean records on Wassermann tests made
among college students as compared to the
record of the public support the high standard
of collegiate morals indisputably.
But Liberty never has been particularly in
terested in truth. Mr. Macfadden, the crusader
against vice, crime, liberalism, conservatism,
et al., is a smart publisher. He knows that the
word "college" placed in juxtaposition to the
word "morals" on the cover of his publications
will skyrocket circulation. Palo Alto's magazine
vendors demonstrated his wisdom by revealing
that the "college morals" number is the only
issue of Liberty to sell out in months.
So the universities are put on the block sim
ply to please a grasping old man, and America
can pay several million nickels and read all
about it in 8 minutes 55 seconds.—J. B.
