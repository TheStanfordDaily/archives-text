EVERY June a great many men graduate from
the University with only a vague idea —or
none at all--of what they are going to do to
earn a living. Four years in college have given
them a cursory knowledge ol a number of
fields, but have done little to equip them for
the business of life.
To meet a similar situation, five years ago
the women of the University established a vo
cational guidance committee to collect a library
on the subject, to distribute interest tests, and
to bring outside speakers to the campus.
Meanwhile more and more men have left
Stanford to go to work in service stations, or,
if they were lucky, to sell insurance. And, to
date, nothing has been done about it.
Surely men students stand in far greater need
of vocational guidance than do women. Con
stantly changing majors and unsettled minds
among men in the senior year testify to the
number of undergraduates who will find no
relation between their college training and
their life's work.
If, by a system of education, lower division
students could be made to realize the impor
tance of preparing for the field they are going
to enter, if interest and ability tests, speakers on
professions, and a vocational library were avail
able, Stanford men would have a better chance
to apply their university education to their later
life.
When Ex Committee moved to satisfy this
need last night, it moved wisely and well.
