A LITTLE more than two months ago, when
the first Daily of the quarter was issued,
everyone was agog over what looked as if it
v/as going to be the beginning of the Second
World War,
Talk of the conflict buzzed through the Ad
Building on Reg Day, hummed along the Quad
and swarmed in bull sessions in the Cellar,
outside of the Libe, in halls, in fraternity houses.
In those first vivid days of roaring headlines
and blaring radio bulletins Stanford was keenly
conscious that the major powers of Europe wore
at war.

From that consciousness—and from the dis
illusioning aitermath of the First World War—
Stanford students, together with college men
and women throughout the nation, firmly de
termined that the United States must remain
at peace.
But two long months have gone by since that
time, and, viewed from this side of the Atlantic,
the struggle is becoming a bit dull. With a
philosophy as practical as that of the Chinese,
the land troops of both sides have stopped
fighting until the rainy season is over. And
the only actual warfare consists of sporadic
combats at sea and in the air.
Now, when the European conflict is losing
popular interest, Americans must guard more
jealously than ever their determination to stay
out of war. That resolution must not be al
lowed to weaken merely because fighting tem
porarily is at a halt.
Higher and higher the pyramid of public
opinion for peace must be built. And more
than any other single group, the college stu
dents of America bear the responsibility for this
task.
They are the educated people who can face
the problem intelligently and sanely. They are
the young people who will be killed if the
United States goes to war.
For the protection of their country, for the
protection of themselves, Stanford students
must keep v/orking for peace.
