## NORMAL DELUSIONS 
### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
|>SYCHIATRISTS have a lot of lunatics to treat who
have very vivid imaginations. Some of them think
they are married to the Duke of Windsor; some of
them think they are in the jaws of hell, being burned
by purgatory fires. Doctors call such beliefs delu
sions. They define a delusion as having three charac
teristics: First, the belief must be false. Second, the
Ix?licf must lx> resistant to logic. And third, the be
lief must lx? out of keeping with the patient's past
experience.
Tills third qualification is very necessary, because
if an insane delusion is merely a false, reason-proof
belief, practically the whole world is mad. Mobs in
Germany, mobs in Britain, mobs in America all have
fanatical ideas. But the mobs are the norm; so mob
false beliefs arc not insane delusions. Perhaps we
could call them normal delusions.
But mobs aren't the only ones. Almost every one
of us has some deep prejudice to which we cling in
spite of all persuasion. A few of us even want to shed
our stubborn fixations, but often we can't. Just as
in the case with the beliefs of lunatics, there is an
emotional foundation for these "normal delusions,"
and the feeling outfights the thought.
# * t- t
ASA SELF-TEST we need only shout a few com
mon epithets at ourselves and watch the preju
dicial, unreasoning response: Radical! Reactionary!
Foreigner! Any one of those words can settle import
ant issues for many of us without a moment spent
in thought. Maybe that is their biological use: ihey
save the trouble of thinking.
It has always been said that a college education
should give us some profession or skill and a good
cultural background. But if that's all it gives us,
our independent thinking days may well end with
commencement. Exposure to a varied assortment of
intellectual fields and ideals should give us graduation
degrees in open-mindedness, even if it shocks the folks
back home.
Many of our prejudices are drummed into us by
well-meaning childhood influences, and it takes
strength and intelligence to break the early traditions.
But at a university every person has the opportunity
that many do not take—to think for himself and
choose his own political beliefs, his own values, his
own standards of justice.
Th«> only prejudice lhat a Stanford graduate need
have is against Cal men. And that normal delusion
anyone who saw the Big Game will forgive.

of us has some deep prejudice to which we cling in
spite of all persuasion. A few of us even want to shed
our stubborn fixations, but often we can't. Just as
in the case with the beliefs of lunatics, there is an
emotional foundation for these "normal delusions,"
and the feeling outfights the thought.

ASA SELF-TEST we need only shout a few com
mon epithets at ourselves and watch the preju
dicial, unreasoning response: Radical! Reactionary!
Foreigner! Any one of those words can settle import
ant issues for many of us without a moment spent
in thought. Maybe that is their biological use: ihey
save the trouble of thinking.
It has always been said that a college education
should give us some profession or skill and a good
cultural background. But if that's all it gives us,
our independent thinking days may well end with
commencement. Exposure to a varied assortment of
intellectual fields and ideals should give us graduation
degrees in open-mindedness, even if it shocks the folks
back home.
Many of our prejudices are drummed into us by
well-meaning childhood influences, and it takes
strength and intelligence to break the early traditions.
But at a university every person has the opportunity
that many do not take—to think for himself and
choose his own political beliefs, his own values, his
own standards of justice.
Th«> only prejudice lhat a Stanford graduate need
have is against Cal men. And that normal delusion
anyone who saw the Big Game will forgive.
|>SYCHIATRISTS have a lot of lunatics to treat who
have very vivid imaginations. Some of them think
they are married to the Duke of Windsor; some of
them think they are in the jaws of hell, being burned
by purgatory fires. Doctors call such beliefs delu
sions. They define a delusion as having three charac
teristics: First, the belief must be false. Second, the
Ix?licf must lx> resistant to logic. And third, the be
lief must lx? out of keeping with the patient's past
experience.
Tills third qualification is very necessary, because
if an insane delusion is merely a false, reason-proof
belief, practically the whole world is mad. Mobs in
Germany, mobs in Britain, mobs in America all have
fanatical ideas. But the mobs are the norm; so mob
false beliefs arc not insane delusions. Perhaps we
could call them normal delusions.
But mobs aren't the only ones. Almost every one
of us has some deep prejudice to which we cling in
spite of all persuasion. A few of us even want to shed
our stubborn fixations, but often we can't. Just as
in the case with the beliefs of lunatics, there is an
emotional foundation for these "normal delusions,"
