# CAMPUS OPINION
## THE 						AGE OF FAITH

r JMIE EDITOR, SIR:
We were disappointed to read in The Daily an
editorial criticism of a peace proposal unaccompanied
by a report of the proposal itself. Wc refer to com
mentary on an invitation by the Youth Committee
Against War to college students to attend a national
congress in Chicago this Christmas vacation. Incor
porated in the committee's invitation were concrete
suggestions 10 bo discussed during the meetings, and
it was against these suggestions that the editorial was
directed.
We arc not. defending the national organization, but
do take exception to the criticisms expressed by The
Daily. One criticism was an expression of the fu
tility of youth's efforts. The solution of the problems
of peace and war needs more than good intentions, yes,
but, without good intentions it. can get nowhere. Start
ing with good intentions and an organization, the
youth of this country can provide a rallying point from
which the mobilization of public opinion for peace can
proceed. No one should attempt to assassinate such an
idea by branding it ineffective.

A NOTHER criticism was directed against, a war rcfer
endum. If a war referendum is inadvisable on the
grounds that voters are defenseless against the propa
gandist, then where is substance for the defense of any
kind of democratic proceedings? There can be no
more crucial governmental function than the decision
of one nation 1o demand of its youth organized mur
der on the youth of another group.
Do you, Mr. Editor, have no hope that intelligence
will defeat war as well as "Ham and Eggs?" If it were
our decision to choose war or peace could we not be
heard? Let us now be heard to the efTect. that we
want a voice in the declaration of war.
A third criticism was against the committee's stand
for a halt in U. S. militarization. We firmly l>olicve
ihat. continued absorption of our national wealth in
super armaments can only lead us into war! Adding
strength to our army and navy gives increase to our
international confidence and impudence. It saps our
financial stability, thereby creating "need for war."
We believe that such an expansive armament will not
be vised for defense of our shores, and that the United
States has no responsibilities as international police
man.
