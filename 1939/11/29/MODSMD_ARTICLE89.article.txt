# Frosh Woman Writes Satire On Dictators
## 
### 
''KEF.DI.E," liv Deirdre and
William Cnnselman, Jr.
Among the outstanding Robleites
of the class of '43 is Dee Conselman,
and to prove it, her first book is out
and aimed at the Christmas trade.
She and her brother Bill wrote it
this summer, as a satire on dicta
tors in general and one in particular
—Adolf Hitler.
Enlivened with the unique full
page illustration of Fred Fox, Keedle
tells the story of a little boy who
hated laughter worse than anything,
and while the other children played,
he fed bu«s to his pet spider. Be
tween times he wrote a book called
"Keedle's Kampf," grew up to be a
man with a mustache and became
a dictator. He finally got so Na
poleonic that he gave the world
twenty-four hours to get out.
This appealed to the world's sense
of humor pretty strongly, so that
as it laughed, Keedle began to de
flate. Although he tried to ignore
the noise, and stuffed synthetic cot
ton in his ears, it. didn't help, so
that he finally disappeared like a
bug between two gigantic thumbs.
Now this department would hate
to be accused of including this Ut
ile book under such a portentous
Classification as "counter-propagan
da," but when Keedle's land is de
scribed as a "Land of plenty," with
twice too much for everybody,"
readers over 10 will get a faint
whiff of rodents.
The book has real entertainment
value for all reader ages, however,
and when wrapped in Christmas
pretties will make a very interest
ing package for anybody's Yuletide
stocking.—Littlcboy
