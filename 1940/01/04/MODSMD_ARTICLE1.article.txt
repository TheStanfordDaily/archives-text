### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
r JMIOSE FINNS are taking the j
"blitz" out of Russia's "blitz
krieg."
Just as Stanford moved into final
exams, the Russians decided to break
through Finland's Mannerheim Line
and establish military protection for
Murmansk and Leningrad. But the
Finns had other ideas.
The result, for the past month, has
been a genuine, life-sized war in
northern Europe. The thing that
surprised you probably as much
that unexpected Christmas gift from
old Cousin Joe is the fact that small
Finland is dealing rather roughly
with big Russia. The worlds best
military strategists are at a loss to
explain it.
People Who Know About Those
Things agree that if the Russians
unleashed a steady heavy-artillery
barrage, instead of intermittently
blasting the Mannerheim Line with
small artillery, they could literally
blow Finland from the map. Any
number of explanations have been
advanced to explain Russia's com
plete military impasse. Poor staff or
ganization, lack of competent lead
ership, and internal dissension have
all been advanced as reasons for
the bog-down.

A II) from tlie Scandinavian
countries and the Allies may
also contribute to Finland's firm
stand. Yesterday, after vacillat
ing in hopeless indecision, Ger
many finally clarified her stand on
the Finnish invasion by warning
Norway, Sweden, and Denmark
not to permit assistance from Eng
land and France to reach the Finns.
This whole Russian invasion has a
strange international twist. For
years Stalin has fostered the broth
erhood of workers, the common bond
that binds together the laborers of
the world. Ever since her own rev
olution that toppled the aristocracy
and established a government of the
proletariat, Russia has been the
shrine of liberal, class-conscious re
formers.

with lightning ra
k pidity, that carefully cultivated
illusion of an idealistic Russian
democracy for the common man
was destroyed when Stalin pledg
ed his nation in alliance with Adolf
Hitler's fascist Germany. That was
a pragmatic agreement; a political
right-about-face with an economic
motive. And the world revised its
opinion in practice.
At this point the world decided
that Stalin was one of the century's
cleverest politicians. It watched
Russia play, with overwhelming
success, the steel-ribbed game of
power politics. It saw the comple
tion by Molotov of buffer alliances
with Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and
the swift pyramiding of Russian
prestige in diplomatic circles. Mos
cow became the capital of European
statesmanship. What Russia had
lost in the realm of ethics, she
gained in the field ol practical pol
itics.

4 ND then came that day when
Russia, realizing that strategic
Leningrad was just 22 miles from
the border of a hostile nation and
that vital Murmansk could be
swept by enemy fire, tried to bluff
little Finland into military conces
sions to the Soviets. The world saw
how that bluff failed, how the high
ly-touted Red Army was sum
moned forth to battle. And, for a
month, it has watched Russia's
hopeless floundering in the throes of
warfare that should have been ter
minated in two or three short
weeks.

There is small doubt that Rus
sian can, eventually, conquer Fin
land. No one will argue that the
Soviets, with limitless man power
and overwhelming supremacy in
war materials, cannot, sooner or ,
later, subdue the Finns. But,
meanwhile, for every Finn that |
dies, 12 Russians arc perishing. |
Tliis is no way to win a war.
