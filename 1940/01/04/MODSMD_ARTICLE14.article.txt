## Cement to He Poured On Third Floor Soon 
### 
Though its upward mushroom i
growth has ceased, Stanford's $600,- I
000 Hoover War Library has been |
acquiring a solid set of concrete]
walls and floors since the end of!
uatumn quarter.
Until the recent rain hampered i
construction activities, approxi- j
mately 70 men had been working on j
the 271-foot tower, stated Jim Dickie
of the Wagner Construction Com- j
pany. Time lost because of holiday!
lay-offs was also responsible for!
slowing up work during the school j
vacation.
Wooden frames from the base-!
ment walls, poured before December!
15, have been removed and concrete [
pouring has proceeded as high as the j
second floor. Floors are formed by i
a six-inch-thick slab of reinforced {
concrete.
The elevator hopper for raising the J
mixed aggregate up to the desired !
floor level has been moved up to the j
third floor in preparation for pour- j
ing of the floor slab at that height, i
Wall frames for the many second- I
floor cubicles or offices are being j
erected.
Plumbing and heating work began .
with the installation of steam pipes |
and other fixtures in the basement;
by Monahan & Stauffacher, plumb- ;
ing contractors.
