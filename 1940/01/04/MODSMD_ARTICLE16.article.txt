## 
### 
Road construction on Lomita
Drive will widen the street west of
the Quad and provide parking fa
cilities opposite the Physics Build
ing, according to the Engineer's of
fice in the Department of Buildings
and Grounds.
The new parking lot will be 50
feet deep and will run almost the
entire length of the Quad. Con
struction involved the removal and
transplanting of sevei'al trees, as
well as the leveling and scraping of
the land.
The project was begun last Sep
tember under the direction of J. W.
McDonnell, campus engineer, and the
time of its completion is as yet un
determined.
