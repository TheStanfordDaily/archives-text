# Quarterly Reg Pains Feature Stanford's 1940

### BUD AMES 
There's nothing as relaxing as a |
vacation.
And every Stanfordite had a "sim- 1
ply wonderful" vacation. It must be
true for they all—to the last man—
said so yesterday between stabs at j
their registration notebooks.
Favorite saying of the day was j
i "Happy New Year." One raincoated ,
: student with a fuzzy smile and a I
j tired look, happy-new-yeared four- j
i teen friends. We asked him why he
! said the same thing to every one.
HAPPY NEW YE All
"Oh, mostly because I can't re- |
I member their names," he chuckled. ;
! "If I beat them to the punch with a I
;Happy New Year, they think for
! sure that I remember their name and I
j go away happy. Get it?"
And he was swirled ofT into the
| seat-card line. Over on a writing j
i table a dazed blonde was thumbing j
frantically through her booklet.
"Oh, dear, I can't find pages 11 i
and 12 in my book," she moaned, j
"and I've looked everywhere."
A friend explained that those two j
| pages had been omitted by the Uni
versity.
Across the table, another blonde i
pondered, then turned to the girl !
on her right.
BLONDE BAFFLED
"Does physical training mean'
gym?" she questioned.
"I'm not sure," the other girl ad- |
mitted. "I just fill in 'no' every i
i quarter and nobody seems to mind."
Later, a thin male—he's a Daily
i business staff man—chuckled to him
' self over the employment page in his
; booklet. In the proper blank he
I stated that he earned 20 per cent of
i his college expenses. Then to a |
, friend he admitted that he never got i
j any work; but he always filled the)
i blank thusly because it made him
| feel that he was hard working.
The man on his right was drawing ■
i arrows from one blank to another. I
He explained that it was much easier j
I than copying his address over and i
over and over.
Time passed. Behind an adviser, '
J seven students waited for sage ad
i vice and a necessary signature. A
| woman, a brunette, was chatting
I with a sad-eyed male. He said some
! thing; her mouth dropped open and
she bleated:
I "Certainly my adviser signed my
S study card during pro-registration.
Do you mean to tell me that he
doesn't have to sign my card again—
I and that I've been waiting all this
| time for nothing? Isn't that silly?"
The sad-eyed man looked sadder
| and turned away his head.
And always in a crowd there are i
j those voices which arc heard, but |
i whose owners go unseen. The fol- j
I lowing pearls of wisdom were picked ]
