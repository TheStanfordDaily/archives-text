### 
A.S.S.U. President Ken Cuthbert
! son yesterday returned to Stanford
i by plane from the fifteenth annual
j congress of the National Student
Federation of America held in Min
| neapolis.
! Enthusiastic over the success of
j the congress, Cuthbertson stated
; that he had received many criticisms,
j compliments, and ideas for the sys
j tem of student government at Stan
j ford.
Attended by about 150 delegates
| from 130 member universities, the
j conference was held at (he Univer-
I sity of Minnesota and was presided
j over by Mary Jeanne McKay of
| Florida State Women's College.
I President elected to take office next
| June was John Darnell of Fresno
State College.
CO-OPERATION iS AIM
The organization has as ils aim
| achieving "... a spirit of co-opera
! lion among the students of the Uni-
J ted States to give consideration to
| questions affecting student mter
i ests"; developing an intelligent stu
! dent opinion on national and inter
| national questions, fostering peace
j and youth movements "independent
; ly of any political party or religious
: sect."
) Most of the business of the Con-
I gross was conducted in a series of
| round table discussions. The sub-
I jects of the round tables included
| "Revitalization of Student Govern-
Iment," "Campus Financial Prob-
I lems," "Student Elections," "Stu
j dent Conduct, Discipline, and the
i Honor Syslem," "Structure of Stu
i dent Government," "Freshman Ori
| entation," "Student, Faculty and
I Administration Relations," and "Stu
| dent Participation in Curriculum
I Change."
REVITALIZING GOVERNMENT
Under the topic of revitalizing
I student government, the many new
j functions of undergraduate govern-
I ment were brought up. Chief
among these was the vocational
guidance leadership for both men
and women. Cuthbertson stated
that a men's group would be estab
lished at Stanford in the near future
to supplement the aetivities of the
present women's guidance group. It
was also suggested that students be
urged to take a more active interest
in the student executive committee.
On the topic of .student elections,
the general opinion was that direct (
primaries were the most efficient
way of nominating campus officers.
; Cuthbertson hinted that several re
| visions in the Stanford election sys
] tem would be made in line with ideas
i gleaned from conference reports be
| fore the next A.S.S.U. elections.
STANFORD COMMENDED
Stanford's financial setup was |
highly commended by other schools.
"This school is one of very few
having a student manager and com
pletely student conti'olled budget,"
stated Cuthbertson. He also re
vealed that a Stanford-supported
resolution to abolish student officers'
salaries was passed.
Another subject in which Stan-!
| ford was termed "outstanding" was'
j student conduct, discipline, and
! honor system. "The main feature
| of our system which needs revision,"
! said the A.S.S.U. president, "is the
j substitution of aid for punishment
I in the treatment of honor code vio
j lators.
Stanford was also commended for
its program of freshman orientation,
but it was suggested that student
faculty relations should be made
smoother and should be continued
I throughout the entire year to a
[ greater extent than is done, at pres
ent, at Stanford.
I CUTHBERTSON LAUDS WORK
The possibilities of closer rela-
I tions between students and depart
j ments of the school in the formation
|of curricula were discussed and
I highly recommended to all colleges.
President Cuthbertson highly
| praised the work of the congress and
| hoped that more universities would
join the federation, ultimately giv
ing a unified, unbiased national
voice to the million students of
American colleges and universities.
"Even had I gained nothing from
the work of the congress, the asso
ciations and the atmosphere alone
justified the trip, despite the zero
weather," he said.

A.S.S.U. President Ken Cuthbert

i by plane from the fifteenth annual
j congress of the National Student
Federation of America held in Min

! Enthusiastic over the success of
j the congress, Cuthbertson stated

j tem of student government at Stan
j ford.
Attended by about 150 delegates
| from 130 member universities, the
j conference was held at (he Univer-
I sity of Minnesota and was presided
j over by Mary Jeanne McKay of
| Florida State Women's College.
I President elected to take office next

State College.
CO-OPERATION iS AIM
The organization has as ils aim
| achieving "... a spirit of co-opera
! lion among the students of the Uni-
J ted States to give consideration to
| questions affecting student mter
i ests"; developing an intelligent stu
! dent opinion on national and inter
| national questions, fostering peace
j and youth movements "independent
; ly of any political party or religious
: sect."
) Most of the business of the Con-
I gross was conducted in a series of
| round table discussions. The sub-
I jects of the round tables included
| "Revitalization of Student Govern-
Iment," "Campus Financial Prob-
I lems," "Student Elections," "Stu
j dent Conduct, Discipline, and the
i Honor Syslem," "Structure of Stu
i dent Government," "Freshman Ori

REVITALIZING GOVERNMENT
Under the topic of revitalizing
I student government, the many new
j functions of undergraduate govern-
I ment were brought up. Chief
among these was the vocational
guidance leadership for both men
and women. Cuthbertson stated
that a men's group would be estab
lished at Stanford in the near future
to supplement the aetivities of the
present women's guidance group. It
was also suggested that students be
urged to take a more active interest
in the student executive committee.
On the topic of .student elections,
the general opinion was that direct (
primaries were the most efficient
way of nominating campus officers.
; Cuthbertson hinted that several re
| visions in the Stanford election sys
] tem would be made in line with ideas
i gleaned from conference reports be
| fore the next A.S.S.U. elections.
STANFORD COMMENDED
Stanford's financial setup was |
highly commended by other schools.
"This school is one of very few
having a student manager and com
pletely student conti'olled budget,"
stated Cuthbertson. He also re
vealed that a Stanford-supported
resolution to abolish student officers'
salaries was passed.
Another subject in which Stan-!
| ford was termed "outstanding" was'
j student conduct, discipline, and
! honor system. "The main feature
| of our system which needs revision,"
! said the A.S.S.U. president, "is the
j substitution of aid for punishment
I in the treatment of honor code vio
j lators.
Stanford was also commended for
its program of freshman orientation,
but it was suggested that student
faculty relations should be made
smoother and should be continued
I throughout the entire year to a
[ greater extent than is done, at pres
ent, at Stanford.

The possibilities of closer rela-

A.S.S.U. President Ken Cuthbert
! son yesterday returned to Stanford
i by plane from the fifteenth annual
j congress of the National Student
Federation of America held in Min
| neapolis.
! Enthusiastic over the success of
j the congress, Cuthbertson stated
; that he had received many criticisms,
j compliments, and ideas for the sys
j tem of student government at Stan
j ford.
Attended by about 150 delegates
| from 130 member universities, the
j conference was held at (he Univer-
I sity of Minnesota and was presided
j over by Mary Jeanne McKay of
| Florida State Women's College.
I President elected to take office next
| June was John Darnell of Fresno
State College.
CO-OPERATION iS AIM
The organization has as ils aim
| achieving "... a spirit of co-opera
! lion among the students of the Uni-
J ted States to give consideration to
| questions affecting student mter
i ests"; developing an intelligent stu
! dent opinion on national and inter
| national questions, fostering peace
j and youth movements "independent
; ly of any political party or religious
: sect."
) Most of the business of the Con-
I gross was conducted in a series of
| round table discussions. The sub-
I jects of the round tables included
| "Revitalization of Student Govern-
Iment," "Campus Financial Prob-
I lems," "Student Elections," "Stu
j dent Conduct, Discipline, and the
i Honor Syslem," "Structure of Stu
i dent Government," "Freshman Ori
| entation," "Student, Faculty and
I Administration Relations," and "Stu
| dent Participation in Curriculum
I Change."
REVITALIZING GOVERNMENT
Under the topic of revitalizing
I student government, the many new
j functions of undergraduate govern-
I ment were brought up. Chief
among these was the vocational
guidance leadership for both men
and women. Cuthbertson stated
that a men's group would be estab
lished at Stanford in the near future
to supplement the aetivities of the
present women's guidance group. It
was also suggested that students be
urged to take a more active interest
in the student executive committee.
On the topic of .student elections,
the general opinion was that direct (
primaries were the most efficient
way of nominating campus officers.
; Cuthbertson hinted that several re
| visions in the Stanford election sys
] tem would be made in line with ideas
i gleaned from conference reports be
| fore the next A.S.S.U. elections.
STANFORD COMMENDED
Stanford's financial setup was |
highly commended by other schools.
"This school is one of very few
having a student manager and com
pletely student conti'olled budget,"
stated Cuthbertson. He also re
vealed that a Stanford-supported
resolution to abolish student officers'
salaries was passed.
Another subject in which Stan-!
| ford was termed "outstanding" was'
j student conduct, discipline, and
! honor system. "The main feature
| of our system which needs revision,"
! said the A.S.S.U. president, "is the
j substitution of aid for punishment
I in the treatment of honor code vio
j lators.
Stanford was also commended for
its program of freshman orientation,
but it was suggested that student
faculty relations should be made
smoother and should be continued
I throughout the entire year to a
[ greater extent than is done, at pres
ent, at Stanford.
