# F.D.R. Asks Defense Tax Expansion
## President Expresses Peace Expectations In Annual Message 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 3 (UP).—
President Roosevelt told Congress,
the people and the world today that
America expects to remain at peace,
but he called for a militant spirit of
unity and an expanded defense
program to safeguard the nation
from enemies at home and abroad.
Reporting in person on the state
of the Union as the third session of
the 76th Congress began, Mr. Roo
sevelt made only two specific legis
lative recommendations:
1. Increased national defense taxes.
2. Extension of the reciprocal trade
treaty act which expires in June.
DEFENDS NEW DEAL
He stoutly defended the New
Deal's economic and social program
and declared it must be continued
and strengthened to prevent internal
collapse and turmoil which spawned
foreign dictatorships. He admitted
many domestic problems, including
unemployment, remain unsolved.
Castigating dictators, flaying iso
lationists and pledging no entangling
alliances with foreign powers, he ap
pealed for non-partisan considera
tion by Congress of domestic and
foreign issues vital to the nation's
future welfare.
The President emphasized his fore
cast that America would remain at
peace with the declaration that it is
not contemplated to send United
States troops to fight on European
soil. He said this country has a
clean record of peace and good will.
REQUESTS NEW POWERS
His predictions of peace coincided
with a request to Congress, made on
the behalf of Secretary of the Navy
Charles Edison, for new emergency
powers which would permit the
chief executive to commandeer fac
tories, ships and materials of all
kinds in time of peace. Naval au
thorities said the proposal was of a
"precautionary" nature.
The message proposed no new con
troversial legislation. While it asked
for national defense taxes, it did not
fix an amount nor did it suggest how
or on whom they should be imposed.
ONLY INCREASE'
It was considered significant the
President said today national de
fense appropriations would be the
only ones increased in the budget
for the fiscal year beginning July 1.
He said "practically all other im
portant items show a reduction,"
substantiating reports that the over
all figure will be under $9,000,000,000.
Attention also centered on the
President's vigorous defense of the
trade treaty program which was
conceived and sincc has betn ad
ministered by Secretary of State
Cordell Hull. It has been reported
frequqently Hull had to "sell" the
program originally to the President
and Mr. Roosevelt was not much
concerned about its fate.
MUST KEEP UNITY
The President laid great stress
upon America's peaceful intentions
and the need of unity. With a warn
ing that America's 130,000,000 people
are certain to feel the shocks of the
European war, Mr. Roosevelt took
his first, cut at the isolationists.
He said he understood the feelings
of those who warn they will never
consent to sending American youth
to fight on European soil again.
"But, as I remember, nobody has
asked them to consent—for nobody
expects such an undertaking," he
observed.
