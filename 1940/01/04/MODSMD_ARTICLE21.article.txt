three men have been most promi

They are Buck Shaw of Santa Clai

Tex Oliver of Oregon.
Shaw and DeGroot are receiving
considerable backing because of
their familiarity with the Stanford
athletic setup. A southern alumni
faction is pushing DeGroot because
he holds A.B. and M.A. degrees from
Stanford, and was football captain,
student manager, a member of Phi
Beta Kappa, and a Warner system
coach.

Shaw because of his splendid coach
