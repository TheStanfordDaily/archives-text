most progressive institutions <

throughout the country, as reported j
by Bob Moulton, president of the j
Stanford Interfraternity Council.
Moulton attended the convention j
in company wilh Dick Hoover, sec
retary of the local council.

greatest anachronism, as evidenced j
by the resolution as passed," Moul
ton stated.
This resolution parallels legislation j
promoted by Moulton on the Stan- !
ford campus, still on the table in the |
hands of Men's Council. It was re- |
vealed at the convention held at the
