# Farm Professor Discovers New Antisyphilitic Drug
## 
### 
I A new drug which promises to he an effective weapon in combating |
syphilis has l>een offered to the medical profession hy ihe Stanford School
! of Medicine.
Discovered hy Dr. Paul J. Hansiik, head of the Department of Pharma
cology at Stanford, the new drug sobismol has been developed for oral \

►capsule use by him and assistant
| investigators at (he School of Medi
cine.
The product is a compound of me
tallic bismuth and has been devel
oped into capsule form so that it can
be swallowed and thus taken into
Ihe blood stream through the walls
of the stomach and intestine.
DRUG HEALS LESION
Because sobismol can be taken
i orally it has been found to be a very
useful drug since it produces prompt
! healing of syphilitic lesions and acts
with killing effect on syphilis germs
I in the blood and tissues. The cap
j sule treatment acts favorably with
j patients who are upset by injection |
j treatment.
Despite the drug's success it has j
| been ponited out that the "pills for j
! syphilis" are no more than an ad- j
1 vance in one sector of the battle
i against the disease. Stanford inves
tigators also offer the warning that
I the new treatment is not a quick
| cure-all, nor is it fit for self-pre-
I scription.
I SOBISMOL NOW USED
Sobismol must be taken in com
bination with injections of salvarsan
or other arsenical compounds. By
clinical experiments alternate treat
j merits of salvarsan in jections for .six
J to ten weeks and oral sobismol for
j 10 to 20 weeKs have proved most
satisfactory. Total treatment takes [
i nearly two years.
For nearly four years clinical trials
of the new drug have been carried
jon in syphilis clinics of San Fran
! Cisco, Los Angeles, Cleveland and
' Philadelphia. Approval of sobismol
jas an antisyphilitic agent by the
! Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry
jof the American Medical Associa
tion in December, means Ihat the
I product is now available for general
I use by the medical profession.
RELIEVES PAIN
Sobismol's abilily to penetrate the
brain and nervous system has en
| abled it to bring relief from pain in
1 a high percentage of cases in the
late stages of neurosyphilis. Neuro
syphilis is the destructive late stage
in which the disease attacks the !
brain.
Oral administration of bismuth
, presented a formidable problem to
Dr. Hansiik and his co-workers; for
I bismuth had been thought non
absorbable from the alimentary
canal into the bloodstream. Hunts
lor a chemical mix to make sodium
bismuthate, most stable bismuth
compound, soluble, finally resulted
in the complicated sobismol com
pound.

I SOBISMOL NOW USED
Sobismol must be taken in com
bination with injections of salvarsan
or other arsenical compounds. By
clinical experiments alternate treat
j merits of salvarsan in jections for .six
J to ten weeks and oral sobismol for
j 10 to 20 weeKs have proved most
satisfactory. Total treatment takes [
i nearly two years.
For nearly four years clinical trials
of the new drug have been carried
jon in syphilis clinics of San Fran
! Cisco, Los Angeles, Cleveland and
' Philadelphia. Approval of sobismol
jas an antisyphilitic agent by the
! Council on Pharmacy and Chemistry
jof the American Medical Associa
tion in December, means Ihat the
I product is now available for general
I use by the medical profession.
RELIEVES PAIN
Sobismol's abilily to penetrate the
brain and nervous system has en
| abled it to bring relief from pain in
1 a high percentage of cases in the
late stages of neurosyphilis. Neuro
syphilis is the destructive late stage
in which the disease attacks the !
brain.
Oral administration of bismuth
, presented a formidable problem to
Dr. Hansiik and his co-workers; for
I bismuth had been thought non
absorbable from the alimentary
canal into the bloodstream. Hunts
lor a chemical mix to make sodium
bismuthate, most stable bismuth
compound, soluble, finally resulted
in the complicated sobismol com
pound.
I A new drug which promises to he an effective weapon in combating |
syphilis has l>een offered to the medical profession hy ihe Stanford School
! of Medicine.
Discovered hy Dr. Paul J. Hansiik, head of the Department of Pharma
cology at Stanford, the new drug sobismol has been developed for oral \

►capsule use by him and assistant
| investigators at (he School of Medi
cine.
The product is a compound of me
tallic bismuth and has been devel
oped into capsule form so that it can
be swallowed and thus taken into
Ihe blood stream through the walls
of the stomach and intestine.
DRUG HEALS LESION
Because sobismol can be taken
i orally it has been found to be a very
useful drug since it produces prompt
! healing of syphilitic lesions and acts
with killing effect on syphilis germs
I in the blood and tissues. The cap
j sule treatment acts favorably with
j patients who are upset by injection |
j treatment.
Despite the drug's success it has j
| been ponited out that the "pills for j
! syphilis" are no more than an ad- j
1 vance in one sector of the battle
i against the disease. Stanford inves
tigators also offer the warning that
I the new treatment is not a quick
| cure-all, nor is it fit for self-pre-
I scription.
