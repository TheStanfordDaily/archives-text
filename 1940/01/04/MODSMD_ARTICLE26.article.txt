# Bailey Publishes Diplomacy Book
## 
### 
"A Diplomatic History of the
American People," written by Dr.
Thomas Bailey, professor of history,
was one of (he first books pub
lished by the Croft American His
tory Series in 1940.
Dubbed a "rapid up-to-the-min
ute survey of U. S. History" for
"'plain readers" in the last issue of
Time, Dr. Bailey's history covers
American diplomacy from the found
ing of Jamestown to Franklin
Roosevelt's Neutrality Proclama
tion. and is considered the most
readable book in the field.
Although Dr. Bailey's emphasis is
on public opinion, he has attempted
to place American diplomacy in its
proper economic, social, and polit
ical background. The author's stress
on personality and anecdotal style
makes diplomatic history lively
reading. The author is in the East
at the present time, and will not
resume his instruction at Stanford
until next fall quarter.
Norma Case, 1939 Atlanta high
school graduate, was neither late
nor absent during the twelve and
a half years she attended the public
schools.
