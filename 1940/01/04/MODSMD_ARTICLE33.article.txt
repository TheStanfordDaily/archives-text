# Waterfront Tie-up landed, Clerks Back
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 3 (UP).—
San Francisco's 54-day waterfront
tieup ended today as C.1.0. ship
clerks went back to work under a
truce that left the principal Issues
of the strike open for negotiation
and study.
Thousands of longshoremen and
other dock workers, who were shut
off from jobs when the cargo check
cr.; struck Nov. 10, trooped back to
the Embarcadero in a driving rain
storm.
The ship clerks' settlement re
newed the conditions of the contract
which expired Sept. 30 and provided
for a 10-day bargaining period to
begin Friday. At the end of that
time all unsettled points will be sub
mitted to a three-man arbitration
board, with the exception of the
number on union demand — for
union registration and pref?rential
hiring of all clerks. This issue will
be studied by a committee named by
Governor Culbert L. Olson, but the
committee's decision will not be
binding.
