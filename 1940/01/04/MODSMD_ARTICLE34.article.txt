### 
MINNEAPOLIS, Minn., Jan. ?>
(UP). â€”Charred bodies of the last ;
of 18 tenants known to have perished j
in the city's most disastrous lire
were removed late today from the
smouldering and ice-encrusted ruins
of the Marlborough apartment hotel.
Thirty of the 114 persons regis
tered at the. hotel were reported
missing by E. G. Gates, chief of the
Minneapolis Red Cross office, who
said he feared some of them also
might have perished. lie said it was
apparent not all tenants were reg
istered.
Assistant Fire Chief James A.
Craigie said the search revealed no
more bodies than the 18 which had
been removed to the county morgue.
He said it was possible, however,
that other tenants might have been
charred so badly that their bodies
were overlooked, or they might be
buried beneath the debris.
The game of chess came to Europe
by way of India and Persia but its
origin is lost in antiquity.
