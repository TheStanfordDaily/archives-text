# Movement for Return Of Stanford Boat Club Gains Alumni Support
## Redwood Harbor Suggested as Site Of Crew Activities; Jack Yates May Coach Cardinal Crewmen 
### JERRY BRUCKER 
Almost two decadcs have passed since crew laded out of the sports
set-up on (lie Farm. Now, with a movement under way to form a Boat
Club, it appears that rowing may again enter the Stanford athetic picture.
Several rowing enthusiasts now attending Stanford, including Jack
Yates, who rowed on the Caifornia crews of '34 and '.'{s that won two suc-

cessive Poughkeepsie regattas, have,
succeeded, during the past quarter,
in surmounting most of the obstacles
that defeated past efforts to get the
sport under way again here.
If an enthusiastic and satisfactory
response by the students is forth
coming, a Cardinal crew could be
on the water this season.
Ky Ebright, head crew coach at
California, has promised to furnish
a boat and a set of oars if a club is
formed here. Arrangements have
been made whereby the crew could
work out in Redwood Harbor.
HARBOR DREDGED
Redwood Harbor is only a 10-
minute drive from the campus, and
has recently been dredged so that
the water is deep enough for row
ing activities.
Yates, who was an assistant crew
coach at Cal under Ebright after he
finished his collegiate rowing career,
is now attending the Stanford Grad
uate School of Business and would
be able to coach-the oarsmen.
Arrangements have been made
for land on which a makeshift boat
house could be constructed, and
showers are available.
LAUNCH OFFERED
Mr. Ernile de Hoff, a crew man
himself at Heidelberg, who runs the
Redwood City boat works, has of
fered to furnish a coaching launch,
to act as boatman, and care for the
shells.
Alumni help has been promised if
the student response is satisfactory.
With alumni support, a boathouse
could be constructed where the row
ing shells could be kept.
Several former Cal crewmen now
doing graduate work at Stanford are
among those trying to bring crew
back. Among them arc Kirk Smith,
who stroked the Bears at Pough
keepsie last spring, and Jack Hoeffer,
who rowed on the Cal crew a year
ago.
MEETING TUESDAY
Yates intends to hold a meeting
next Tuesday to see how many would
be interested in going out for crew.
He said that pi-evious experience
was not necessary. While he was
at California, he continued, they had
trouble getting a turnout because
men who had no experience didn't
think they had a chance.
Those interested in the movement
should see either Jack Yates, 500
Encina; Lee Peake, 137 Encina; or
U ed Cole, 139 Encina.

If an enthusiastic and satisfactory
response by the students is forth
coming, a Cardinal crew could be
on the water this season.
Ky Ebright, head crew coach at
California, has promised to furnish
a boat and a set of oars if a club is
formed here. Arrangements have
been made whereby the crew could
work out in Redwood Harbor.
HARBOR DREDGED
Redwood Harbor is only a 10-
minute drive from the campus, and
has recently been dredged so that
the water is deep enough for row
ing activities.
Yates, who was an assistant crew
coach at Cal under Ebright after he
finished his collegiate rowing career,
is now attending the Stanford Grad
uate School of Business and would
be able to coach-the oarsmen.
Arrangements have been made
for land on which a makeshift boat
house could be constructed, and
showers are available.
LAUNCH OFFERED
Mr. Ernile de Hoff, a crew man
himself at Heidelberg, who runs the
Redwood City boat works, has of
fered to furnish a coaching launch,
to act as boatman, and care for the
shells.
Alumni help has been promised if
the student response is satisfactory.
With alumni support, a boathouse
could be constructed where the row
ing shells could be kept.
Several former Cal crewmen now
doing graduate work at Stanford are
among those trying to bring crew
back. Among them arc Kirk Smith,
who stroked the Bears at Pough
keepsie last spring, and Jack Hoeffer,
who rowed on the Cal crew a year
ago.
MEETING TUESDAY
Yates intends to hold a meeting
next Tuesday to see how many would
be interested in going out for crew.
He said that pi-evious experience
was not necessary. While he was
at California, he continued, they had
trouble getting a turnout because
men who had no experience didn't
think they had a chance.
Those interested in the movement
should see either Jack Yates, 500
Encina; Lee Peake, 137 Encina; or
U ed Cole, 139 Encina.
Almost two decadcs have passed since crew laded out of the sports
set-up on (lie Farm. Now, with a movement under way to form a Boat
Club, it appears that rowing may again enter the Stanford athetic picture.
Several rowing enthusiasts now attending Stanford, including Jack
Yates, who rowed on the Caifornia crews of '34 and '.'{s that won two suc-

cessive Poughkeepsie regattas, have,
succeeded, during the past quarter,
in surmounting most of the obstacles
that defeated past efforts to get the
sport under way again here.
