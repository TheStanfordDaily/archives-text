# Frosh Quintet Work on Plays
## Papoose Basketball Squad Drills for Game 
### 
With work on offensive as the
keynote, H. B. Lee, frosh basketball
coach, is putting his charges through
several strenuous workouts this
week in preparation for their game
with San Jose High School this Sat
urday evening at 7:30 o'clock. There
will be no admission charge for the
game.
When his boys returned from the
Christmas holidays Coach Lee found
that Don Hall, one of the best pros
pects at forward, had left school.
He is trying Ed Stamm, end on the
football team, at Hall's forward spot,
and the latter may start the San Jose
game at that position.
SCRIMMAGE SCHEDULED
Because the frosh need some hard
work to get back in condition after
the vacation, Lee has scheduled a
scrimmage against the strong San
Jose State freshman cagers for to
morrow afternoon at 3:30 o'clock.
Everyone on the squad will get into
the scrum, and it's quite likely that
Coach Lee will use performances
against the Staters to determine his
starting line-up for the San Jose
High game.
FROSH LOOK GOOD
As it stands now the starting line
up will be chosen from among the
following boys: McCaffrey, Voss,
Stamm, Dana, Eikleman, Meyer, and
Funabiki.
Ed Voss and Jack Dana, both
Oakland boys, have shown them
selves to the best scoring threats in
games with Lodi High, U.S.F. Frosh,
and the Stanford B team reserves.
The Frosh won the first two games
easily, but were tripped up by their
Stanford brethren.
