LOS ANGELES, Jan. 3 (UP).â€”
! Athletic Director Willis Hunter of
Southern California declared today
the Trojans are bound by a ruling
prohibiting charity games, in dis
cussing the proposed national clvim
pionship game between U.S.C.. the
Rose Bowl champion, and Texas A.
& M., the Sugar Bowl winner.
"Worthy as th'e Finnish relief
I fund cause is," declared Hunter, "a
Pacific Coast Conference ruling pro- i
! hibits division of gate receipts with
any third party. It would be neces
sary to obtain conference approval I
before we could act on such a pro- |
> posal."
Hunler declared the university's
attitude "would be that the season is j
ended," but he said any formal bid '
would be submitted to the athletic I
council.
