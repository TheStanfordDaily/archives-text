# Atherton Story Gets Spotlight At P.C.C. Meet
## Officials Predict Report Will Bring Re-organization 
### 
Although the first day's session
yesterday was devoted mainly to
routine matters pertaining to the eli
gibility of various athletes, rumors
seeping from behind closed doors at
the annual Pacific Coast Conference
meeting, now being held in Los An
geles, indicated that the main busi
ness today will be the far-famed
Atherton report.
Compiled by Edward N. Atherton,
a former member of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, the report
is expected to be one of the most
important documents ever presented
to the Pacific Coast Conference
meeting, which includes faculty rep
resentatives of the ten member uni
versities.
THREE-YEAR JOB
Atherton spent three years gather
ing his material, which consists of a
2,000,000-word treatise on athletes
and athletic conditions in the con
ference. Gathered at a cost of
$40,000. its contents will positively
not. be released for publication, ac
cording to Professor C. V. Ruzek of
Oregon State, president of the con
ference.
It was expected by informed cir
cles that the report will result in a
reorganization of the conference,
and many prominent members were
hinted to be in favor of the Pacific
Coast organization setting up a posi
tion of high commissioner, similar to
the post now held by Major John L.
Griffith in the Far Western Confer
ence, widely known as the Big Ten.
The high commissioner would
have the job of seeing that all the
rules in matters pertaining to ath
letics are enforced, including schol
arships. eligibility, and proselyting.
FIVE FAVOR PLAN
A check yesterday by the Asso
ciated Press on member school rep
resentatives showed that five of the
schools were in favor of such a plan.
A majority vote of six schools would
be necessary to have it put into
effect.
Atherton is being suggested as the
logical man for the post, if it mate
rializes, and it is understood that he
will give careful consideration to any
offers.
-Preliminary inspection of the con
tents of the report by faculty lead
ers has brought admissions that
many of the present regulations
need revising.
APPLICATIONS HEARD
At yesterday's opening session,
Chuck Bechtol, University of Wash
ington guard, was denied another
year of eligibility, while Bob Blen
kinsop, University of Oregon end,
had his application for another year
of eligibility approved.
Due to the President's Thanks
giving Day proclamation, it. was de
cided to set the opening of 1940 fall
football practice at Sept. 12, instead
of Sept. 11.
Announcement of 1940 conference
track-and-field dates was also ex
pected before the meeting closes.

-Preliminary inspection of the con
tents of the report by faculty lead
ers has brought admissions that
many of the present regulations
need revising.
APPLICATIONS HEARD
At yesterday's opening session,
Chuck Bechtol, University of Wash
ington guard, was denied another
year of eligibility, while Bob Blen
kinsop, University of Oregon end,
had his application for another year
of eligibility approved.
Due to the President's Thanks
giving Day proclamation, it. was de
cided to set the opening of 1940 fall
football practice at Sept. 12, instead
of Sept. 11.
Announcement of 1940 conference
track-and-field dates was also ex
pected before the meeting closes.
Although the first day's session
yesterday was devoted mainly to
routine matters pertaining to the eli
gibility of various athletes, rumors
seeping from behind closed doors at
the annual Pacific Coast Conference
meeting, now being held in Los An
geles, indicated that the main busi
ness today will be the far-famed
Atherton report.
Compiled by Edward N. Atherton,
a former member of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, the report
is expected to be one of the most
important documents ever presented
to the Pacific Coast Conference
meeting, which includes faculty rep
resentatives of the ten member uni
versities.
THREE-YEAR JOB
Atherton spent three years gather
ing his material, which consists of a
2,000,000-word treatise on athletes
and athletic conditions in the con
ference. Gathered at a cost of
$40,000. its contents will positively
not. be released for publication, ac
cording to Professor C. V. Ruzek of
Oregon State, president of the con
ference.
It was expected by informed cir
cles that the report will result in a
reorganization of the conference,
and many prominent members were
hinted to be in favor of the Pacific
Coast organization setting up a posi
tion of high commissioner, similar to
the post now held by Major John L.
Griffith in the Far Western Confer
ence, widely known as the Big Ten.
The high commissioner would
have the job of seeing that all the
rules in matters pertaining to ath
letics are enforced, including schol
arships. eligibility, and proselyting.
FIVE FAVOR PLAN
A check yesterday by the Asso
ciated Press on member school rep
resentatives showed that five of the
schools were in favor of such a plan.
A majority vote of six schools would
be necessary to have it put into
effect.
Atherton is being suggested as the
logical man for the post, if it mate
rializes, and it is understood that he
will give careful consideration to any
offers.
