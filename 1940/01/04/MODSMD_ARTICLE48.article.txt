# Dave Castillaux trims Contender

### 
TORONTO. Jan. 3 (UP). â€”Dave
Castilloux of Montreal, Canadian
lightweight champion, won a 10-
round decision over Leo Rodak,
lightweight contender from Chicago,
last night.
The fight was fairly even through
out. Castilloux kept a streaking left
jab continually in Rodak's face, and
got the belter of a brief bit of slug
ging in the fourth.
