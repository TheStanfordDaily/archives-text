# Swimming Team Wrecked By Injuries, Eligibility
## 
### 
The total wrecking of Stanford's national record holding freshman swim
ming relay team of last year was completed today.
The ruination of the three man squad started last year when Paul
Herron, all-around National champion, dropped from school, and was
made final with the announcement yesterday by Coach Nort Thornton

that Scott Dudley, National
man breaststroke champion and rec
ord-holder, and Gardner Miller,
free-styler on the trio, are out for
the season.
Dudley will be seholastically in
eligible, and Miller has been ruled
out of competition by doctor's
orders.
Chances for a conference cham
pionship were dunked beyond re- !
demplion by the losses.
But Coach Thornton still holds
four chances for first places in the
all-conference meet. Pre-dope calls
for Roy Vitousek, breaststroker and
freestyler; Bill Weeden, backstrok
er; Howard Adams, diver; and the
medley relay team of Vitousek,
Weeden and either Brad Young or :
Pete Okumoto to make conference j
"best" showings.
Young was also a member of the i
champion frosh team, and Okumoto '
made his debut with starting times j
in the interclass meet last year.
January 20 will see the same meet
run off this season. The clash will
be the first which makes up a
heavy schedule.
