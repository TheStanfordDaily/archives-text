CLUMBUSEN, 0., Jan. 3 (UP.â€”
Ohio State, defending Big Ten bas
ketball champions, weathered a last
minute California rally tonight to
defeat the touring Pacific Coast bas
ketball team, 49-45.
The game was enlivened by a fist
fight in ihe second period between
John Schick, Buckeye forward, and
Guard George Jung of California.
Both were withdrawn from the
game.
Ohio State led during the entire
contest except for a few minutes at
the beginning of each half. Califor
nia overcame a 22-14 disadvantage
to trail by 27-25 at half time.
Bob Alamadia, California, and Jee
Mees, Ohio State, tied for high-point
honors with 17 points each. Cap
tain Bob Lynch of Ohio State, who
paired with P/lees at guard, scored
1G points.
With four minutes to go, Califor
nia threatened the Buckeye's 46-40
lead. Alamadia slipped through Ohio
State's defense for two baskets, put
ting the Coast five within two points
of the Big Ten team. Ohio State,
however, took the offensive and con
trolled the ball the remainder of the
game. Jack Dawson's field goal sup
plied the clincher.

The magpie is very tame in Nor
way, nesting even in the gardens of
town houses.
