# Stanford Casaba Quintet Powers Over Easterners
## Critics Hail Card Quint 'Towering, Sensational, Clever' in Christmas Wins Stanford Casaba Victories Road Better in Quantity and Quality Than California Boars' Record 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Shades of Hank Luisetti and tlu' Laughing Boys of two years ago in
vaded Eastern basketball courts Christmas vacation, howled over five of
sis. comers, and were on their way home today basking in the knowledge
that their barnstorming record surpassed California's.
As soon as the team returns Saturday morning, the team will have its

work cut out for them for the next <
week. Pacific Coast Conference's
Southern Division play opens at the
local Pavilion next Friday and Sat
urday nights with the Indians enter
taining the Bruins of U.C.L.A. At
the .same time California moves to
Los Angeles to engage the team-to
beat, Southern California.
FORWARDS STRONG
Stanford, Cal, and U.S.C. were all
touring the East and all three teams |
saw their opponents in action at
some time during the tour. The
Uclans with a new coach and a
none-too-impressive Christmas cam
paign are not being figured any bet
ter than their old fourth place posi
tion in the four-team league. How-J
ever, Coach Dean won't let his men i
forget that last year the Bruins]
made things pretty interesting in a
couple of games.
Besides producing for Eastern
consumption a team which had crit
ics calling them towering, sensa
tional, and clever, Coach Everett
Dean gave his six opponents a look
at an unsung 6-foot forward, Don
Williams. And for Williams' run
ning mate at the other forward, Dean
produced another unnoticed player.
Forest Anderson.
COMBINATION SCORES
Williams and Anderson scored 151
points or almost half of the team's
total points. But what was even
more impressive, Williams and An
derson averaged 15 and 10 points
per game while the former went on 1
a scoring rampage in the Nebraska ;
game with 26 points before going j
out of the game on fouls.
Stanford's tour opened inauspi-]
ciously against the Cornhuskers
Dec. 20. when the Nebraskans tri- j
umphed 48-47 in the last minute of!
play after the Indians had led them '
by a comfortable margin all the way I
to the tape.
LOPSIDED SCORE
In their next tilt, the Cards
trounced one of the better Eastern;
cage teams. Rutgers University, 71-
43, in which all 12 men played at
some time during the game. For one
thing the game showed that Stan
ford's offensive strength was fairly \
well distributed throughout the
squad. Anderson poured in 18
points, Williams scored 15, Leon La
faille and Ken Davidson made 8
points each, while Dick Taylor net
ted 7 points.
The Rutgers game slat ted the sport
scribes on their way to finding out
different methods to describe the In
dians. They called them towering
but unless Rutgers were midgets
the scribes must have been looking
around for descriptive terms. The
Indians starting five averages just
over 0 feet as against Cal's 6 ft. 4 in.
out (it.
Dean got his men past the Uni
versity of Baltimore the day follow
ing Christmas, 45-43, and had to
rely on Anderson's sharp-shooting
that time for 13 points to get by.
DARTMOUTH AGAIN
In a pair of double-header pro
grams in Philadelphia, Stanford
thumped Dartmouth, 55-29, and Co
lumbia, 55-31. In the latter game,
Dean got his first line on the rela
tive strength of Stanford and Cal.
Cal barely nosed out the Lions,
43-156.
In both games Williams and An
derson were again top scorers, each
potting 2(5 points. Also in both
} ames. eleven men saw action and
the scoring was fairly evenly di
vided.
