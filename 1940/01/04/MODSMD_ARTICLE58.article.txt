# Card Professor To Lead NCAA
## Win. B. Owens Named Head for Third Time 
### 
Stanford Law Professor William B.
Owens was elected president of the
National Collegiate Athletic Associa
-1 tion for the third straight year at
the annual meeting of the N.C.A.A.
1 which was held in Los Angeles dur
' ing the recent Christmas recess.
Feature of the N.C.A.A. meeting
was a code framed and adopted by
that body which provided for en
forcement of restrictions placed upon
members of the association.
The particular paragraph of the
code which caused somewhat of a
controversy with the American
Football Coaches' Association, read
as follows:
"The membership of any member
failing to maintain acceptable schol
astic or athletic standards may be
terminated by the vote of two-thirds
of the delegates present at an an
nual convention."
Coach Lou Little of Columbia,
president of the Coaches' Associa
j tion, violently disagreed with that
' particular part of the code, saying,
I in part, that "you can't get any
! place by compulsion or restriction of
J . . .an agricultural school which
( does not have the high academic rat
i ings of ... a technical institution."
