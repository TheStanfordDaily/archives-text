# Card Trackmen Get New Stars
## Jaysee Sprinters Join Farm Team 
### 
Registration for winter quarter
adds three brilliant tracksters to
Stanford's already imposing array.
Coach Bill Ellington announced the
entrance to school of three crack
sprinters, Ken Battaglia, Lon Mc- \
Farland, and Don Williams.
All three are junior college trans- >
fers and all are capable of breaking'
10 fiat and 22 seconds, in the sprint ;
events. Battaglia was last year's Cali- 1
fornia jaysee spirnt champion and
hails from Santa Rosa J. C.
McFarland, who transferred from j
San Mateo, was right on Battaglia's
heels in last year's big meet. While 1
Williams, who hurls the javelin over I
200 feet as well as hustling the fur- !
long in 21.8. is from Sacramento
J. C.
The weather lately isn't very en- |
couraging for the tracksters and j
doesn't give them much chance to |
try out the newly surfaced Angell
Field track. In> order to get anyj
workout at all, the distance men will
spend their time jogging around thej
protected gravel runway halfway |
up the outside of the stadium until
the skies clear.
