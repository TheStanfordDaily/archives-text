# Card tankman Named All-Star
## 
### 
Dick Hoover, guard on Stanford
University's water polo team last
year, was named on an all-confer
ence by rival coaches in December.
Second string on the same mythi
cal team last year. Hoover was ihe
only Stanford player to gain a posi
tion.
Captain Bob Plate, Bob Allen and
Dave Nottage were given votes by
the coaches, but not enough to place
them on either team. Coaches are
allowed to cast one choice, but can't
vote for their own players.
Johnny Lamb, University of Cali
fornia star, and five U.C.L.A. play
ers completed the team.
