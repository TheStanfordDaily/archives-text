# Ram's Head Seeks Play Manuscripts
## 
### 
Ram's Head is issuing a call for
all amateur playwrights to submit
manuscripts in their second annual
one-act play contest. Dan Holtom,
drama society's one-act play direc
tor, announced yesterday that any
one interested in participating should
submit a manuscript. Previous ex
perience in play-writing classes, etc.,
is not necessary.
Winners will automatically be
come members of Ram's Head, their
plays will receive production, and
their names will be engraved on a
plaque. Three plays will be chosen
for production, and will be presented
sometime this quarter. The contest
deadline will be announced later.
Winners of the contest, inaugu
rated last year by Ram's Head to
stimulate and encourage original
dramatic writing on the campus,
were James Stone's "Beginning
Without End," Art Levinson's "Thir
ty Years," and June Lee Dimmitt's
"Angry Mountain."
