# The 						People's Coach

### 
EVER since the Big Game the most discussed
question on the campus has been: What
is Stanford going to do about the football situa
tion? v
From a tangle of suggestions ranging all the
way from paying salaries to the players to abol
ishing intercollegiate football one definite an
swer finally emerged. A change was needed in
the coaching set-up.
Taking its cue from student, alumni, and fac
ulty opinion, at its last meeting of 1939 the Board
of Athletic Control voted not to recommend the
renewal of Tiny Thornhill's contract for the
coming year. Thus the move to remedy the
Stanford football situation began.
However, the B.A.C.'s troubles have only
started. It is easy enough to get rid of the wrong
man for the job, but it is not so simple to get
hold of the right one.
The Committee on Staff, consisting of one
student, one faculty member, and one alum
nus, has been spending the weeks since the
meeting interviev/ing and investigating pros
pective coaches. And it may be expected to
recommend certain candidates at the Board
meeting next Sunday.
If such nominations are made, three repre
sentatives of the student body, Stan Hiserman,
Hampton Pool, and Ken Cuthbertson, will be
called upon to vote for the man that Stanford
wants for its head football coach.
By personally contacting people they know
these three men may have been able to get
some idea of campus opinion on this subject.
But they cannot be expected accurately to rep
resent the student body unless they are given
some practical aid.
That is why tomorrow morning The Daily will
take a poll of student opinion on who shall be
the new coach.
If a large vote results, the canvass will be a
valid guide for the B.A.C. representatives. If
only a few hundred ballots are cast, it will be
worthless.
Tomorrow the bleacher coaches will get a
chance to have their say.
Any griping they may do after that will be
iutile.

hold of the right one.
The Committee on Staff, consisting of one
student, one faculty member, and one alum
nus, has been spending the weeks since the
meeting interviev/ing and investigating pros
pective coaches. And it may be expected to
recommend certain candidates at the Board
meeting next Sunday.
If such nominations are made, three repre
sentatives of the student body, Stan Hiserman,
Hampton Pool, and Ken Cuthbertson, will be
called upon to vote for the man that Stanford
wants for its head football coach.
By personally contacting people they know
these three men may have been able to get
some idea of campus opinion on this subject.
But they cannot be expected accurately to rep
resent the student body unless they are given
some practical aid.
That is why tomorrow morning The Daily will
take a poll of student opinion on who shall be
the new coach.
If a large vote results, the canvass will be a
valid guide for the B.A.C. representatives. If
only a few hundred ballots are cast, it will be
worthless.
Tomorrow the bleacher coaches will get a
chance to have their say.
Any griping they may do after that will be
iutile.
