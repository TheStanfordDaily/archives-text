# Hello in Winter
## 
### 
NO matter what people say about Stanford
being the place where people used to say,
"Hello," but now are as unfriendly as they are
untraditional, Stanford and Stanford people are
more than friendly when new students come
into the Farm "family." Yes, they are—autumn
quarter.
In the fall, when 1000 or so people come here
for the firsi time, Stanford opens its gates and
opens its arms. Then, when new students come
in winter quarter, Stanford takes it all in stride,
without batting an eyelid. And without as much
as an abortive "Hi" to welcome the new stu
dents.
That is the way it used to be.
But this quarter, with upwards of 100 new
students coming to the Farm for the first time,
the A.S.S.U. is seeing that they don't have to
make their own way altogether and adjust them
selves in a purely hit-or-miss fashion.
Instead, it is giving these new students an
official welcome. A.S.S.U. President Ken Cuth
bertson and Vice-President Coline Upshaw will
greet them tomorrow afternoon in the Nitery,
and faculty members from 15 departments will
meet them.
And these new students will begin to feel at
home at Stanford. They will feel they are a part
of Stanford. This is not only a very decent
gesture on the part of the A.S.S.U. officers and
the faculty; five will get you ten that the results
from this friendly welcome will be registered at
the end of the quarter in bawlout averages.
Contacts will have been made, friendships
started, and these new students can get off to a
clear, clean start, academically and socially.—
