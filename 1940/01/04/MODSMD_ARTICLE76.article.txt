# Stanford in the Shells?
## 
### 
STANFORD is one of the few colleges located
near a navigable body of water that does not
have a crew.
After 18 years of reasonable success, the
sport was abandoned here in 1921 because of
the large financial outlay and small income it
entailed, because of somewhat unfavorable
rowing conditions on the Bay, and because
certain faculty members felt that the training
it required was too severe.
Today a movement is under way to revive
crew at Stanford.
Certain of the objections that killed it almost
20 years ago have been eliminated. Recently
dredged, the Redwood City Yacht Harbor nov;

offers an excellent course for rowing activities.
Many medical authorities now claim that crew
is no more taxing than most other intercollegiate
sport.
There remains the financial problem.
If a crew is formed here, it will bo organized
not as a major or a minor sport, but as a club
which will receive no outside support. It will
have to keep solvent through donations made
by alumni and other interested parties, a num
ber of which have been promised alreadyâ€”if
enough men turn out. Cal's coach Ky Ebright
has generously offered to lend the group a boat
and a set of oars.
Although it would be essentially an intra
mural affair at first, when the club had a chance
to develop it could compete with other uni
versities and junior colleges that go in for crew
on a small scale.
The boys are not counting on going to
Poughkeepsie next year. All they want is a
chance to experience the fun of rowing.
