HAVE A GOOI) VACATION?
IT'S HARD to explain what sort of a vacation one
has had. And of course the un-New-Year-likc
crowds in the Ad Building don't make it any easier.
"Have a good vacation?"
"Pretty good, I guess. How about you?"
Stock question, stock reply. All Reg Day conversa
tions can be expected to do is to re-enroll our way
ward Stanford vernaculars. It's amazing how quickly
Farm localisms are lost in the rush of a Christmas
vacation and a New Year's Eve of quiet self-com
munion, or other occupation.
Who would think of rushing down to the Christmas
tree bright and early at 11:30 Christmas morning and
saying to various members of the family with a jovial
slap on the back: "What's doin' kid? D'ja have a nice
Christmas Eve?"

F>UT local banter-habits aren't the only things that
change during an eighteen-day vacation. All the
quarter-established habits of thought and action —
largely the latter—are in conflict with a Stanfordless
vacation. It doesn't take long to get back in "the
spirit"—not when people are eternally wondering if
you "had a good vacation;" But looking back, home
and the gamut of Cluistmas-New-Year's activities were
a definite break in the steady steam of experiences
that all center around Stanford—.so much so that one
almost feels like a different person after five minutes
in the Ad Building. It isn't quite so dramatic as "Dr.
Jekyl and Mister Hyde"; it's no new horizon for Boris
Karloff. But changing personalities for eighteen days
and then changing back, no matter how placid the
change seems to be, is an interesting experience—one
that insures against drabness and ruts.
Thomas Jefferson thought it would stimulate democ
racy to have the Constitution voted on every twenty
years. Whether right or wrong in politics, the prin
ciple certainly applies ot individuals. It's mentally and
emotionally invigorating to change environments at
the end of every quarter, even if one engages himself
with more confetti than thought.
As a matter of fact one did engage himself with
more confetti than thought. Maybe that is the source
of this change of feeling. After all, it requires a cer
tain amount of mental alertness to think up trigger
quick answers to the same question for a whole week:
"D'ja have a good vacation?"

change during an eighteen-day vacation. All the
quarter-established habits of thought and action —
largely the latter—are in conflict with a Stanfordless
vacation. It doesn't take long to get back in "the
spirit"—not when people are eternally wondering if
you "had a good vacation;" But looking back, home
and the gamut of Cluistmas-New-Year's activities were
a definite break in the steady steam of experiences
that all center around Stanford—.so much so that one
almost feels like a different person after five minutes
in the Ad Building. It isn't quite so dramatic as "Dr.
Jekyl and Mister Hyde"; it's no new horizon for Boris
Karloff. But changing personalities for eighteen days
and then changing back, no matter how placid the
change seems to be, is an interesting experience—one
that insures against drabness and ruts.
Thomas Jefferson thought it would stimulate democ
racy to have the Constitution voted on every twenty
years. Whether right or wrong in politics, the prin
ciple certainly applies ot individuals. It's mentally and
emotionally invigorating to change environments at
the end of every quarter, even if one engages himself
with more confetti than thought.
As a matter of fact one did engage himself with
more confetti than thought. Maybe that is the source
of this change of feeling. After all, it requires a cer
tain amount of mental alertness to think up trigger
quick answers to the same question for a whole week:
"D'ja have a good vacation?"
HAVE A GOOI) VACATION?
IT'S HARD to explain what sort of a vacation one
has had. And of course the un-New-Year-likc
crowds in the Ad Building don't make it any easier.
"Have a good vacation?"
"Pretty good, I guess. How about you?"
Stock question, stock reply. All Reg Day conversa
tions can be expected to do is to re-enroll our way
ward Stanford vernaculars. It's amazing how quickly
Farm localisms are lost in the rush of a Christmas
vacation and a New Year's Eve of quiet self-com
munion, or other occupation.
Who would think of rushing down to the Christmas
tree bright and early at 11:30 Christmas morning and
saying to various members of the family with a jovial
slap on the back: "What's doin' kid? D'ja have a nice
Christmas Eve?"
