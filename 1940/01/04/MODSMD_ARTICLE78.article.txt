HP HE EDITOR, SIR:
... If there is to be a change, I am heartily in
favor of turning away from the highly publicized
purely professional football coach in favor of an
alumni staff. My work lakes me into a large number
of slates and I find that the alumni everywhere arc
hoping that we will help to rationalize collegiate ath
letics by returning them to the University, the student
body and the alumni. They are largely in accord that
even the alumni should become less active in their
demands for championship teams and permit the stu
dents to work out their destiny as they see fit. . . .
There is a rather prevalent feeling that such a
policy must be directed by a capable and unselfish
Stanford alumnus; a man who understands and be
lieves in the creeds and traditions of the University;
a man who will be able to instill these beliefs into the
students wilh whom he will come in contact. . . .
It is my sincere belief that Dudley S. DeGroot has
proven himself capable of undertaking such an assign
ment. . . .

r EDITOR, SIR:
. . . The cycle has run its course and it is up to
Stanford lo get a Stanford man to lead them out of
the wilderness. Stanford has developed leaders in
every other line, why shouldn't they have developed
leaders in fool ball? They have. Turn your eyes a
little south lo San Jose, where Dud DeGroot has done
a job that is talked about wherever football men get
together. . . .
Sutherland is good; so is Shaw; so is Smith; Oli
ver; etc. But none of them had as good a record be
fore they were put in charge of a major team as
DeGroot has right now. I ask for a Stanford man to
lead Stanford teams and in DeGroot I feel that we
will find the man that will do for Stanford's football
what Lanigan and Pressly did earlier; what Frank
"Husky" Guerrena did for crew; what Dink Templeton
did for track. . . .

r rHE EDITOR, SIC:
If Stanford wants a new coach and if the Stanford
Daily is interested in a few highlights on one of the
prominently mentioned successors, I refer you to the
files of the old Dippy, beginning in the fall of 1919.
You will find that one Dudley Sargent DeGroot was
among other things:
Football captain, a three-letter man and one of the
greatest centers Stanford ever had; a two-letter man
in basketball; three times national Intercollegiate back
stroke swimming champion; a member of a Stanford
water polo team that won the national intercollegiate
championship.
Olympic Games champion in rugby; student body
manager; a member of the Men's Council; student mem
ber of the 8.A.C.; student major of the R.0.T.C.; or
ganizer and first president of the Interfraternity Con
ference: one of the original freshman sponsors; mem
ber of Stanford's Glee Club; member of Stanford
choir and Phi Beta Kappa. . . .
