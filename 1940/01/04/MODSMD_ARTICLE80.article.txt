## 
### 
"No Time for Comedy" now playing at the Cumin Theater in San
Francisco.
For an actress of Kathcrinc Cornell's caliber, a slick drawing-room
comedy is easy; however, S. N. Behrman's "No Time for Comedy" is a play

quite up to her talents, and it's
pleasure to see her taking part in the .
witty goings-on up at the Curran.
"No Time for Comedy" is an in- j
telligently written story full of
barbed comments about a writer ol J
drawing-room comedies, who feels
that in these days of misery, hatred,
and fear, there is "no time for com
edy." Obviously, Behrman is ex
pressing his own sentiments through
his play. And his author, in the end.,
sees that his talent for comedy is |
necessary for a world in which
laughter is sadly lacking. So he be
gins to write a play about an author
of drawing - room comedies who
wants to write a serious play about
the horrible state of the world.
Get it?
Played by Francis Lederer, the au
thor is n spoiled, utterly charming
Austrian, given to tantrums and
colorful profanity. The intense emo
tionalism of this character enhances
and adds spice to Cornell's part—that
of his wife.
Linda is an actress married to this
pyrotechnic personality, and her cool
detached amusement at him serves
to infuriate the author, who com
plains wildly that his wife's per
sonality so unnerves him that he is
going to have to divorce her and
marry another woman just so he
can have the satisfaction of being
unfaithful to her.
Margalo Gilmore gives a clinical
portrait of the other woman, whose
hobby is discovering latent possi
bilities in the men in whom she
takes an interest. John Williams and
Tom Helmore speak the beautiful
Behrman dialogue with just the
right nuances.
Cornell never saves on her casts,
but us usual she manages to out
shine her excellent support.—Nowell

comedy is easy; however, S. N. Behrman's "No Time for Comedy" is a play

quite up to her talents, and it's
pleasure to see her taking part in the .
witty goings-on up at the Curran.
"No Time for Comedy" is an in- j
telligently written story full of
barbed comments about a writer ol J
drawing-room comedies, who feels
that in these days of misery, hatred,
and fear, there is "no time for com
edy." Obviously, Behrman is ex
pressing his own sentiments through
his play. And his author, in the end.,
sees that his talent for comedy is |
necessary for a world in which
laughter is sadly lacking. So he be
gins to write a play about an author
of drawing - room comedies who
wants to write a serious play about
the horrible state of the world.
Get it?
Played by Francis Lederer, the au
thor is n spoiled, utterly charming
Austrian, given to tantrums and
colorful profanity. The intense emo
tionalism of this character enhances
and adds spice to Cornell's part—that
of his wife.
Linda is an actress married to this
pyrotechnic personality, and her cool
detached amusement at him serves
to infuriate the author, who com
plains wildly that his wife's per
sonality so unnerves him that he is
going to have to divorce her and
marry another woman just so he
can have the satisfaction of being
unfaithful to her.
Margalo Gilmore gives a clinical
portrait of the other woman, whose
hobby is discovering latent possi
bilities in the men in whom she
takes an interest. John Williams and
Tom Helmore speak the beautiful
Behrman dialogue with just the
right nuances.
Cornell never saves on her casts,
but us usual she manages to out
shine her excellent support.—Nowell
