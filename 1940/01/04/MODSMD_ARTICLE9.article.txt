# Newcomers Will Meet At Reception
## A.S.S.U. Sponsors Gathering at Nitery Today, 3:30-5:30 
### 
J Because this winter's crop of over
| 100 new students has "no one to go
to" or any other way to get ac
quainted with Stanford or with it
self, the A.S.S.U. is sponsoring an
informal, non-faculty reception this
afternoon from 3:30 to 5:30 o'clock
in the Nitery for the benefit of all
newcomers to the Farm.
During the course of the afternoon
j campus leaders from 15 branches of
! the student government and activi
j ties will welcome guests, answer
! questions on all points of Stanford
J life, present themselves as advisers
! and friends.
