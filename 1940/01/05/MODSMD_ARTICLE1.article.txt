### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
/'ERMANY'S Number Two Nazi,
Hermann Goering, became Ger
many's Number One Nazi in the
realm of economics yesterday when
Hiller named him supreme director
of Germany's wartime economic
policy. It was a surprise move that
seems to point, somehow, to a long
struggle against Britain and France.
In Goering's hands will be gath
ered new wartime powers "in order
to meet the British blockade with a
superior chess move." And, at the
same time, new war taxes and regu
lations for compulsory savings of
portions of all higher incomes will be
decreed soon for the duration of the
war, it was rumored throughout
Germany.

These new taxes constitute just
one more indication that Germany is
settling down for a hard, long battle
against the Allies. The new war lev
ies will probably affect luxury
goods like champagne, wine, beer,
cigars, cigarettes, and theater tickets
while the compulsory savings will
apply to all incomes above 400 marks
or about $160, monthly. Portions of
incomes above 400 marks will be
deposited in regular or special sav
ings accounts in banks which will in
turn invest them in state obligations
for financing the war.

O n T feature of this new plan,
obviously, isihat such "pay as
you go" financing would practic
ally eliminate the issuance of the
usual war loans — provided, of
course, the income were great
enough to cover normal war-time
expenditures.
Goering hasn't said much about
his new appointment, but his chief
underling State Secretary Koer
ner, outlined what he called "three
necessary assumptions" which must
be followed if Germany is to cope
with, and defeat the British block
ade.
These "necessities" involve strict
centralization of authority and au
thoritarian direction of the entire
war economics system; permanent
and closest co-operation between all
government and party units as well
as producing units connected in any
way with war economy; and disci
pline and intelligent co-operation of
the entire German people. In addi
tion to these somewhat high-flown
phrases, Koerner described Ger
many's war economic policy as
"elastic and hard-hitting, inventive
and audacious in finding a new
method ... in opposing the Brit
ish economic war."

of the factors in (he Brit
ish economic attack that Gocr
ing will have to meet is the block
ade of exports leaving Germany
for foreign nations. London, de
spite the protests of neutral Euro
pean powers and, too, the United
States, is determined to continue
her halting of ships hearing prod
ucts destined for nations outside
belligerent Europe. In fact, yes
terday Great Britain informed the
United States that only under
"very exceptional circumstances"
will German products consigned to
this country he exempted from the
general British blockade of Nazi
exports.
The British were insistent, how
ever, in emphasizing that the answer
yesterday didn't constitute a reply
to our official American note of Dec.
8 in which we questioned the legal
ity of the export seizures under in
ternational law. They're going to
reply to that later, they say. It's
easy to see, however, that America's
protests are simply formal gestures;
England will not satisfactorily alter
her blockade plans for America or
for any other nation, no matter how
insistent become the cries.
So, when little, rotund Hermann
Goering steps into the most im
portant single job in Germany's
wartime set-up, that of engineering
the complex economic machinery
which, ultimately, tells the story of
success or failure on the battle
front, he'll have more problems to
tackle than ever he had as a field
marshal in Adolf Hitler's army.
