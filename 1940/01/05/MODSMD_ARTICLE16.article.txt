Today Stanford students are re
quested to vote for their choice of a
coach to succeed Tiny Thornhill.
Ballot boxes will l><* placed on the
English and Engineering corners, at
the entrance to the library, and in
the Union Cellar between 8 and 4:30
o'clock.
The object of the poll is to enable
the Board of Athletic Control—es
pecially the student members—to
consider the desires of Stanford stu
dents when voting for a new coach.
The poll is expected to furnish the
B.A.C. an accurate consensus of stu
dent opinion.
COACHES LISTED
In the adjoining column The Daily
has provided a list of the leading
coaches under consideration, with a
brief resume of each one's record.
The list is not complete. The B.A.C.
committee -on - staff, consisting of
student Hamp Pool, alumnus Wal
ter Ames, and faculty member
Thomas Storey, has, according to re
liable sources, assumed that every
coach in the country is available,
and has been working accordingly.
A write-in space has been pro
vided in case there is a preference
for a coach not listed.
B.A.C. MEMBERSHIP
The B.A.C. consists of nine mem
bers, each having one vote. There
are three student members—Hamp
Pool, Stan Hiserman, and Ken Cuth
bertson; three alumni members—L.
R. Weinmann, Walter Ames, and
Wesley Howell; and three faculty
members—Dr. Thomas A. Storey,
Professor William B. Owens, and
Dr. J. P. Mitchell. Howell, the chair
man, votes only in case of a tic.
Although lack of space prevents
The Daily from presenting data on
the organizational ability, character
standing, and general personality of
the coaches, students are asked to
consider these points.
The results of the poll will appear
in Monday's Daily, but they will lx
revealed to the B.A.C. members be
fore Sunday night's meeting.
