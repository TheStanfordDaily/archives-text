"Because of too many other ac
tivities and general disinterest grow
ing out of a lack of co-operation,"
President Andries Deinum of the
Stanford chapter of the American
Student Union resigned from ex
ecutive duties in a surprise move
effective last night.
"The people who have the time
and money are not sufficiently in
terested in the A.S.U. and do not
do anything about it, and the ones
who are interested have to work too
hard and haven't enough money to
do the work," Deinum stated in an
interview last night,.
Deinum refused to state whether
his action was caused by the recent
refusal of the National A.S.U. Con
vention in Madison, Wis., to brand
Russia the aggressor in its present
conflict with Finland.
