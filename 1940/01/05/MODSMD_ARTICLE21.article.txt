# Ex-Stanford Man Writes Best Seller
## 
### 
Cedric Larson, '34, co-author of
one of the year's best-selling non
fiction books, "Words That Won the
War," was a member and a col
umnist of the Stanford Daily staff
for several years.
Larson and James R. Mock's vol
ume is a study of the activities of
the Committee on Public Informa
tion which operated after American
intervention in the World War. This
was the so-called "propaganda min
istry" under Wilson, headed by
George Creel.
Larson has been doing special re
search in the Library of Congress
and the U. S. Adjutant-General's
office in Washington, DC.
