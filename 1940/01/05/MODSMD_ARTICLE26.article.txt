### JERRY MAYER 
THE LITTLE MAN WHO
JUST WON'T GO AWAY
This is about the time of the year
when athletic fans, after a long and
arduous football season, usually
settle back and devote their atten
tion to other sports. It is so all over
the country, with basketball com
manding most of the spotlight.
However, file Pacific Coast is
slill in the throes of football, and
the casaba sport is having its
troubles getting in the limelight.
Most of the post-season gridiron
activity is the result of the pub
lication of the Edwin N. Athcrton
report, involving athletics and ath
letic conditions in the ten Pacific
Coast Conference schools.
Now being mulled over and culled
through by the faculty representa
tives ol the conference schools, meet
ing in Los Angeles, the Atherton sur
vey is keeping football prominent on
the sports pages up and down the
Coast. And, from this distance, it
seems as though Stanford and South
ern California, the only two pri
vately endowed universities in the
Pacific Coast Conference, are engag
ing in a dog-fight over the subject
of tuition scholarships to athletes.
ItUT STANFORD HAS
OTHER TROUBLES
But Stanford has its own little
nest of troubles right at home, what
with the Board of Athletic Control
meeting Sunday night to begin dis
cussions on the subject of a new
football coach.
Just offhand, I can't think of more
than a half-dozen coaches in Amer
ica who haven't been mentioned for
the job, but the concensus is that the
list of most likely candidates has
been narrowed down to three menâ€”
Tex Oliver of Oregon, Buck Shaw
of Santa Clara and Dud DeGroot of
San Jose State.
These men have been established
as the favorites only on the basis
of conjecture. No official word
has escaped from any one of the
nine members of the 8.A.C., which
consists of three students, three
faculty members, and three alumni.
Ostensibly, the job is still wide
open.
So today the Stanford Daily is giv
ing Farm students a chance to take
advantage of student democracy. In
the past, Stanford has more or less
desultorily shrugged off its privilege
of participating in student affairs,
and it has paid. The Administration
has rung through rulings which the
students were heartily against, and
yet the faculty heads cannot be
blamed because most of the students
refused to take the trouble to in
form their representatives as to how
they felt.
The B.A.C. has complete authority
in this matter of hiring a new coach,
except for a final okay by Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur, and one-third of the
B.A.C. was elected by the A.S.S.U.,
and is morally obligated to carry out
the wishes of its constituents.
If enough Stanfordites vote to
day to form a representative con
census. then Ken Cuthbertson,
Stan Iliserman, and Ilamp Pool
would be guilty of disloyalty to the
student body if they did not sup
port the choice of the majority,
providing, of course, that the man
who wins the student poll is avail
able and desirous of the position.
The football team is made up of
Stanford students, and is supported
by Stanford students, who thus are
actually the ones who should have
the most important say as to who
shall succeed Tiny Thornhill.
Cuthbertson, Hiserman, and Pool
owe it to the student body which
elected them to accurately represent
student feeling in this matter.
Further emphasis on the im
portance of this poll to the stu
dents themselves seems unneces
sary.
This is the supreme test of stu
dent democracy, with the students,
the Administration, and the B.A.C.
alike being tested.
It would be criminal at a time like
ill is for Stanfordites to neglect the
opportunity thrust upon them.
