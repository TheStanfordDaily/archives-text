# Victorious Card Cagers Return Tomorrow
## Trojan Five Rated Best Indians Claim Second High Victory Record Over Eastern Teams 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
When the Indian cagers come
home tomorrow morning from
an eastern barnstorming tour,
they will be boasting the sec
ond best campaign record of six
Pacific Coast teams which invaded
basketball courts from Nebraska to
the eastern seaboard.
Only the powerful Trojans, of
Southern California surpassed the
Cardinals in the number of games
won and the impressive way in
which they toppled over opponents.
Sam Barry's veteran quintet, fa
vorites to usurp California's 1939
Southern Division cage crown, trip
ped five straight opponents of the
best Mid-west and Eastern caliber.
At the same time Everett Dean's
locals came through after a first
game defeat by Nebraska to triumph
five straight times over representa
tive Eastern clubs and a strong Big
Ten five.
CARDS BEAT WISCONSIN
Stanford has been on the road
home since defeating Wisconsin
University at Madison, 39-2(i, Tues
day night. Prior to that game the
Indians rode rough-shod over Rut
gers, Baltimore, Columbia, and
Dartmouth.
The Trojans opened with a 44-42
defeat of the strong DePaul outfit.
Then Purdue fell 38-34, a team which
two years ago won over El Troje in
Los Angeles. U.S.C. triumphed in
succession over Notre Dame, 55-38,
Long Island University, 57-49 —
breaking the Blackbirds' 41-game
unbroken victory string—and Tem
ple, 46-30.
In four games in the East and
Mid-west, Santa Clara won three
and lost one. The Broncos toppled
LaSalle, 54-29, College of the City
of New York, 52-30, and Montana
State, 44-25, while losing a 52-50
thriller to DePaul in Chicago, the
team which barely lost to the
Trojans.
BEARS RECORD POOR
The Southern and Northern Divi
sion's respective champions were
badly maltreated by opposing quints.
California didn't even have an even
break in seven games up to Wed
nesday night. Two teams which
Stanford defeated, Columbia and
Dartmouth, held the much-vaunted
Bears to narrow victories, while the
Cards defeated them by wide mar
gins in both games.
Stanford cuffed Columbia, 55-31;
Cal won, 43-36. The Reds dropped
Dartmouth, 55-29; Cal eked out a
42-30 win. The Bears' other victory
was 41-37 over Michigan State. Nibs
Price's towering outfit lost to Penn,
37-34, Marshall, 51-47, Ohio State,
49-45, Wednesday night, and Brad
ley Tech, 40-39.
Oregon's Webfoots Northern titlists
and Pacific Coast champs had an
even worse time losing four out of
six games, one of them to DePaul,
39-37. Oregon defeated Baltimore,
44-40. a team the Cards had a tough
time defeating, 45-43. Washington
State spilt two games with Wayne
University and Purdue.
BRUIN MATERIAL POOR
The Uclan Bruins, Stanford's op
ponents next week-end here in the
Pavilion in the first two conference
jousts, had a none-too-impressive
Christmas campaign on the Coast.
They lost to Santa Clara, 36-22, and
split with San Jose State, 31-40, and
46-33. Wilbur Johns, a former Bruin
forward, is the new U.C.L.A. coach
but his material is the weakest in
many years. Four veterans return
from last year.
