# 'Germany in Better Status For War Than in '14'—Lutz
## 
### JACK BURTT 
Contradicting much popular belief, Dr. Ralph Haswell Lutz, professor
of history and dean of graduate study, said in an interview yesterday that
"Germany is in a better economic position to carry on a long war now
than she was at the outbreak of the World War in 1914."
He pointed out that Germany is drawing on the Danubian and Scaiuli-

navian states, and on Belgium, Hol-<
land, Switzerland, and Italy for
supplies. Moreover, Germany is
maintaining her industry to con
tinue the exports which are essen
tial to her survival as a belligerent
power.
MAKES COLLECTION
Professor Lutz returned last; week
from Europe where he spent the en
lire summer and autumn on a col
lecting trip for the Hoover Library,
of which he is chairman of directors.
He spent the summer months in Ger- j
many, Switzerland, and Holland, ar- j
ranging for the acquisition of books, j
documents, and films on European
social movements since the World
War.
In Holland, Professor Lutz com
pleted negotiations begun earlier by
President Ray Lyman Wilbur for
what is perhaps the greatest 20th
century library on the social history
of Europe. In Germany he acquired
collections of German social history
since the World War, and a 70,000-
volume library on Germany's recent
economic history. He was in Ger
many at the outbreak of the present
war, leaving for Holland on the j
last scheduled passenger train out of |
Munich.
TRAVELS WIDELY
When the war began, Dr. Lutz was
I asked by President Wilbur to remain
I in Europe and establish collecting
agencies to gather materials on the
present war and on the events lead
ing up to it. In carrying out this as
signment he visited Belgium, Hol
land, Germany, the Scandinavian
and Slavic states, and Switzerland,
France, Spain, and Italy. The mate
rials thus acquired will be held by
the collecting agencies until the end
of hostilities, when they will be sent
to the library.
The first comment made upon his
observations of the present European
war was on the lack of a "hurrah"
spirit, which characterized the atti
tude of European peoples at the be
ginning of the last war. "All of the
belligerent peoples arc determined
to see it through," he said, "but they
aren't cheering about, it."
