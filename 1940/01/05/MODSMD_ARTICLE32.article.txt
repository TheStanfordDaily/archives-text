# Farm Entered First Coast Crew at Poughkeepsie in '15
## 
### JERRY BRUCKER 
Stanford's crews came very near ruling the waves hack in the days
when Frank Gucrcna's 1915 Cardinal eight, the first Pacific Coast crew to
enter the I'oughkeepsic Regatta, came in a strong second to Cornell.
Competing in the West against California and Washington, Stanford won
its share of races from schools which had superior equipment and
facilities. A —

OTHERS STARTING
The object of (he present move
ment lo return rowing to the Farm
is not to try and compete against
the Pacific crew giants immediately,
but there are enough schools on the
Coast lhat are in a position similar to
Stanford's to furnish opposition for
a Cardinal boat club.
The University of San Francisco
is organizing a crew for the first
time this year along lines similar to
those used successfully by several
eastern schools that have successfully
started rowing clubs. Oregon State
is another Coast school that is going
in for crew.
1 CONDITIONS IDEAL
j Some years ago U.C.L.A. formed a
crew under circumstances which
make the situation at Stanford look
like a perfect rowing set-up. For the
i first few years, the Bruins had to
travel 70 miles daily to row. Now
the Westwood school can put an
eight on the water that ranks with
any in the country.
Dartmouth, Williams, and Wash
ington and Lee are three of several
eastern schools that formed boat
' clubs with no more equipment than
is available for a Card crew. With
the Redwood City Yacht Harbor only
a 10-minute drive from the campus,
i Stanford has a better set-up for
: rowing than any school on the Pa
-1 ciPic slope, including Cal, except
! Washington.
NEW COMPETITION
Crew has developed so much
i throughout the country in recent
! years that an organization, the Dad
Vail Intercollegiate Rowing Asso
ciation, has been formed to foster
competition among schools who have
just begun rowing and do not have
the equipment to compete against
the more powerful crews.
The Association holds an annual
i spring regatta for its member schools
| which may some day rival the
Poughkeepsie meet.
In addition to the varsity shells of
| U.C.L.A., Oregon State, and U.S.F.,
' several high schools and junior col
leges in the state have crews that
I would be available for freshman
j competition.

Stanford's crews came very near ruling the waves hack in the days
when Frank Gucrcna's 1915 Cardinal eight, the first Pacific Coast crew to
enter the I'oughkeepsic Regatta, came in a strong second to Cornell.

The object of (he present move

is not to try and compete against
the Pacific crew giants immediately,

Stanford's to furnish opposition for
a Cardinal boat club.
The University of San Francisco
is organizing a crew for the first
time this year along lines similar to
those used successfully by several
eastern schools that have successfully
started rowing clubs. Oregon State
is another Coast school that is going
in for crew.

crew under circumstances which
make the situation at Stanford look
like a perfect rowing set-up. For the
i first few years, the Bruins had to
travel 70 miles daily to row. Now
the Westwood school can put an
eight on the water that ranks with
any in the country.
