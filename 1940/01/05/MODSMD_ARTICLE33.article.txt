# Intramural Ruling Hits at Forfeits
## 
### 
At a meeting last night of 70 rep
| resentatives of the various fraterni
! ties and other organizations partici
| pating in the intramural program, a
j rule was passed to remedy the sit -
I uation of forfeits in intramural ath
( letics.
The rule reads as follows: Any
| team which has two forfeits in any
j one sport or three forfeits in all the
| various sports during the year will
not be allowed to compete in in
j tramural athletics for the remainder
I of that school year.
Thus if a team forfeits two foot
j ball games, that team is automat
j ically ineligible for further compe
! tition in all branches of intramural
I activity. The result will be the
j same if a team forfeits one game in
I each of three different sports. The
! rule was suggested by Bill Leckie
I and Bob Plate.
