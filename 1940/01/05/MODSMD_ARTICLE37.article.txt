# Frosh Basketballers to Face San Jose Babes in Scrimmage
## Papooses Meet Strong State Five This Afternoon on Pavilion Floor 
### 
After only two days of practice (
! following the Christmas vacation,
j Coach Beeb Lee's frosh basket bailers
I will really turn on the heat this
I afternoon in a scrimmage against the j
! San Jose State Frosh in preparation
j for their first game this quarter,
| which is to be played against San j
j Jose High School at 7:30 o'clock to- 1
| morrow evening in the Pavilion.
The frosh cagers from State have
I been called the strongest freshman
! quintet to represent the Garden City
I college in history, and undoubtedly
I they will furnish the Papoose squad j
with plenty of competition,
j STARTING LINE-UP
This scrimmage in the Pavilion at
3:30 o'clock will give Lee another
I chance to view his charges in action, i
j and he will probably choose the i
! starting line-ufj for Saturday night's ;
! contest from performances (his af
ternoon.
In the three games they played
i before vacation the frosh won two
| from Lodi High and U.S.F. frosh,
I and dropped one to the Stanford B
; team reserves, m all of these games
. Ed Voss and Jack Dana came i

through with the highest point to
tals, and it's likely that Lee is bank
ing heavily on these two dead-eyes
to hang up lots of points against
San Jose High tomorrow night.
FItOKII SEEK REVENUE
It will be remembered that San
Jose High is the team that defeated
last year's l'rosh quintet in the lat
ter's first game. Naturally Coach Lee
would like to grab the victory to
even his score with that particular
high school, and he thinks that if his
boys play the basketball they are
capable of playing they can come out
on top.
Along with Voss and Dana there
are five other boys who stand a good
chance to start the game. They are
McCaffrey, Stamm, Eikleman, Meyer,
and Funabiki. In practice this week
McCaffrey, Eikleman, and Funabiki
have been working as guards, while
Stamm, Meyer, and Dana are for
wards and Voss is a center.
A clumsy steam wagon for haul
ing guns was constructed by Nich
olas Joseph Cugnot in 1771, but was
never put to practical use.
