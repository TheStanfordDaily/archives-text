# Prepare to Cast Them Now

FAR down on the ballot in the A.S.S.U. elec
tions in February and May there appear the
almost unnoticed names of the candidates for
B.A.C. representatives.
Usually outstanding varsity athletes run for
and are elected to these positions. The elec
torate, believing that any man who can break
48 seconds in the guarter mile or who can kick a
football more than 60 yards is good B.A.C. ma
terial, each year names two of them to voting
posts—without giving the matter any particular
thought.
There is no real reason why these athletes
should not make as good, if not better repre
sentatives than men from any other under
graduate group. But anyone who has regularly
attended meetings of the Board can testify that
they make a practice of taking a back seat in
discussions and allowing the A.S.S.U. president
to do most of the talking for the students.
The reasons that have been put forward to
explain this are (1) that athletes on scholarships
are afraid to disagree with faculty and alumni
groups upon whom their tuition depends; (2)
that physical education majors do not like to
come in conflict with the heads of their depart
ment.
Of course, both of these are weak excuses,
and probably most B.A.C. representatives, past
and present, would not admit, even to them
selves, that they have been influenced by them.
But the fact remains that the scholarship athletes
and the physical education majors have been
the silent members of the Board.
Sunday night the B.A.C. will consider a gues
tion in which every Stanford student —at least
every one who occupies a seat on the players'
bench or in the rooting section —is interested.
If the undergraduates are going to have any
voice in the selection of the new football coach,
the student representatives must do some talk
ing at the meeting. And they must have some
thing to talk about: an accurate idea of campus
opinion.
To this end, The Daily is conducting a poll
this morning to determine the popular choice
for a new coach. Twenty-six probable candi
dates and their records are listed on the front
page, and space has been provided for write-in
choices.
The poll will be a valid indication of campus
sentiment only if a high percentage of the stu
dent body votes. A few hundred ballots will
prove nothing.
A great many students have long complained
that they have no say in matters of this kind.
If Stanford knows whom it wants for its next
football coach, today is the time to say so.

dent body votes. A few hundred ballots will
prove nothing.
A great many students have long complained
that they have no say in matters of this kind.
If Stanford knows whom it wants for its next
football coach, today is the time to say so.
FAR down on the ballot in the A.S.S.U. elec
tions in February and May there appear the
almost unnoticed names of the candidates for
B.A.C. representatives.
Usually outstanding varsity athletes run for
and are elected to these positions. The elec
torate, believing that any man who can break
48 seconds in the guarter mile or who can kick a
football more than 60 yards is good B.A.C. ma
terial, each year names two of them to voting
posts—without giving the matter any particular
thought.
There is no real reason why these athletes
should not make as good, if not better repre
sentatives than men from any other under
graduate group. But anyone who has regularly
attended meetings of the Board can testify that
they make a practice of taking a back seat in
discussions and allowing the A.S.S.U. president
to do most of the talking for the students.
The reasons that have been put forward to
explain this are (1) that athletes on scholarships
are afraid to disagree with faculty and alumni
groups upon whom their tuition depends; (2)
that physical education majors do not like to
come in conflict with the heads of their depart
ment.
Of course, both of these are weak excuses,
and probably most B.A.C. representatives, past
and present, would not admit, even to them
selves, that they have been influenced by them.
But the fact remains that the scholarship athletes
and the physical education majors have been
the silent members of the Board.
Sunday night the B.A.C. will consider a gues
tion in which every Stanford student —at least
every one who occupies a seat on the players'
bench or in the rooting section —is interested.
If the undergraduates are going to have any
voice in the selection of the new football coach,
the student representatives must do some talk
ing at the meeting. And they must have some
thing to talk about: an accurate idea of campus
opinion.
To this end, The Daily is conducting a poll
this morning to determine the popular choice
for a new coach. Twenty-six probable candi
dates and their records are listed on the front
page, and space has been provided for write-in
choices.
The poll will be a valid indication of campus
sentiment only if a high percentage of the stu
dent body votes. A few hundred ballots will
prove nothing.
