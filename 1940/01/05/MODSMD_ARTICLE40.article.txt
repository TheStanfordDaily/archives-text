# Dangerous But Passable
## 
### 
PALO ALTO'S new underpass is still just a
twinkle in the engineer's eye, and it is also
a large stack of rubble making University Ave
nue useless as far as Stanford is concerned.
For the next six months Paly-bound traffic will
be forced to use Embarcadero Road.
But it takes more than a B.A.C. barrier to stop
a Stanford man. A tradition need not expire for
six months simply to accommodate Palo Alto's
civic betterment. The "Ride to Paly" conven
ience will continue.
To allow for the re-routing of traffic, it is sug
gested that students seeking rides to town wait
across the street from the northeast corner of
Encina, near the Pavilion. Most of the traffic
to Palo Alto will pass that point as it proceeds
toward the Embarcadero underpass.
To ride back to the campus, students should
wait at the corner of Alma and University,
either at the bus stop or across the street.
Enough campus-bound traffic will pass this
point to provide adeguate transportation for the
earless.
A little re-adjustment to the new situation will
insure a fine tradition being carried over until
the underpass is completed and Palo Alto will
be 24 seconds closer to Stanford.â€”J. B.
