# S.S.U.
## 
### 
IN this world of conflicting opinion there are
a good many zealots struggling for causes
that they actually know nothing about. These
men and women are so blindly unintelligent
that they will lend unquestioning support to
programs which really are working in direct
opposition to their declared objectives.
A striking example of such a group of un
comprehending minds is the delegation that
recently attended the national convention of
the American Student Union—at which no rep
resentatives of the Stanford chapter were pres
c*-^t
Most of them extreme liberals or radicals, the
members of the A.S.U. have become so hepped
on the subject of Communism that they rejected
by an overwhelming vote a resolution to brand
Soviet Russia the aggressor in its conflict with

Finland.
Simultaneously passing a motion condemning
the aggressions of Germany, the A.S.U. con
vention made itself the laughing-stock of the
nation, as well as a sure-fire target for censure,
by refusing to recognize the fact that the
U.S.S.R. is guilty of exactly the same crimes as
the Nazis.
The only balanced minds at the meeting seem
to have been those of the national chairman and
the executive secretary, both of whom refused
to agree with the majority and since have been
relieved of their posts.
The Stanford chapter as yet has taken no
action on the guestion, but on Registration Day
it announced that it was considering joining the
minority group which plans to force a referen
dum of the vote.
Then suddenly, dramatically, late last night
Stanford's A.S.U. president announced his res
ignation. Refusing to state whether this move
was connected with the convention's refusal to
censure the U.S.S.R., he gave reasons which can
best be summarized as the basic evils of the
capitalistic system.
Perhaps his group had better change its name
to The Soviet Student Union.
