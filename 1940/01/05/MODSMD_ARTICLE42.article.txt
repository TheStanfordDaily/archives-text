### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
SO LONG, TINY
I3ENITO MUSSOLINI, that paragon of fat-faced
Fascism, told the truth for once in his life when
he said, "The crowd is like a woman; it loves strong
men." No group of people is more painfully aware of
that truth than are collegiate football coaches. So
many of them have gotten the axe: Troy's Gloomy
Gus Henderson, Cal's Navy Bill Ingram, U.C.L.A.'s
Bill Spaulding, Stanford's Pop Warner, and now it's
Stanford's again—Stanford's Tiny.
When you are on top of the heap and you have the
cheers of the mob, you like to think that it is more
what you are than what you have done that makes you
the acclaimed hero. Maybe Tiny felt that way just a
few years ago, when Bobby Grayson and the Vow Boys
made Stanford's the best football team in the country.
Tiny was personally likeable then, as he is now. He
was and is popular with his teams. But it wasn't so
much Tiny that made him temporarily secure as a
coach; it was Tiny's teams. Howard Jones has just
enough personality to make him a good running mate
for Alf Landon; that funereal face of his would make
bashful Alf look like Jimmy Cagney. But Howard
Jones' teams win. That's why Jones is a coach.

IT ALL sounds perfectly reasonable. It is natural to
want a good coach. A coach is hired to teach foot
ball. And most of us want him to teach football well.
But no matter how practically you think about it, there
is still something sad about the excitement and en
thusiasm that is sprawled over the front page of The
Daily and all over the campus. Tiny was the toast of
alumni, the roar of rallies. Tiny's teams won. Now
Tiny's teams lose. And Tiny is unmentioned in the
news, lost in the hubbub, almost forgotten.
A new man will ride on Stanford enthusiasm. We
don't know who he will be yet (although many alumni
seem to be pretty sure of Dud DeGroot). But who
ever it is—Sutherland, Shaw, DeGroot, or any other—
the new man will be welcomed with optimism and
cheers. He will seem to draw with personal mag
netism all the Farm's rah-rah support. He will even
be given a certain amount of leeway for losses. But
in the long run, it will be the record of Stanford teams
that makes or breaks him.
The record broke Tiny, and for Stanford all there
remains to do is to start over again. The coach is dead.
Long live the new coach's victories. And meanwhile—
so-long, Tiny.
