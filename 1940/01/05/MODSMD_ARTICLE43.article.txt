# CAMPUS OPINION
## DELEGATION OF POWER 
### 
r rilE EDITOR, SIR:
The Daily in a recent front page article and in
a prominent editorial entitled "Unwritten Law," criti
cized the action of Men's Council with respect to vio
lations of the A.S.S.U.'s regulations on hazing and
public initiation. Both the article and the editorial
failed to present the true picture of the situation in
question.
The editorial maintained that the Council was
worthless "If every time it is forced to make a deci
sion of consequence, it is going to hide behind the skirts
of the Administration." The front page article laid
great stress on the delay caused by the necessity of
the President's approval of the Council's decision. The
whole write-up evidenced a lack of knowledge of the
constitutional provisions governing Men's Council. As
a result it placed the members of that Council and
its chairman in a bad light.
+ * * *
■REFERENCE to the A.S.S.U. constitution would have
disabused the writer of his misinformation. Tine
preamble contains this statement. "We, the students of
Stanford University, in order to exercise power dele
gated to us by the University . . . , do ordain and
establish the following Constitution." Likewise, Ar
ticle 111, Section I, Paragraph a: "The Councils for
student control shall have such jurisdiction over all
cases of a disciplinary nature pertaining to the student
body of Stanford University which is granted to the
Student government by the President of the Uni
versity ..."
Quite obviously, the Council is obligated to ac
count for its action to the President, since he has
delegated his power (vested in him by the Board of
Trustees) to the Men's Council. Not only in matters
of consequence but in all matters, including ihe pet
tiest water-bagging offenses, this Council, in con
formity with the custom established by previous Coun
cils, has always had its decisions approved by the
President.

inconvenience of the delay, alluded to in the
front page article, has also created a wrong im
pression. The local chapters had been informed of
their penalties. They had not been delayed. The In
terfraternity Board of Control need not formulate new
initiation rules until next spring, if necessary. A
week's wait wouldn't inconvenience them. The delay
argument holds no water, yet it has caused an ill
founded and undesirable reaction toward the Men's
Council among the student body.
emotional appeal the Daily made, not a rational one.
You jeopardize student government by arousing opin
ions unnecessarily. Any effort to make newsprint of
normal and conscientious functionings of the Council
can only be dismissed as verging on sensationalism. In
the past that hasn't been the policy typical of the offi
cial publication of the Associated Students.

emotional appeal the Daily made, not a rational one.
You jeopardize student government by arousing opin
ions unnecessarily. Any effort to make newsprint of
normal and conscientious functionings of the Council
can only be dismissed as verging on sensationalism. In
the past that hasn't been the policy typical of the offi
cial publication of the Associated Students.

The Daily in a recent front page article and in
a prominent editorial entitled "Unwritten Law," criti
cized the action of Men's Council with respect to vio
lations of the A.S.S.U.'s regulations on hazing and
public initiation. Both the article and the editorial
failed to present the true picture of the situation in
question.
The editorial maintained that the Council was
worthless "If every time it is forced to make a deci
sion of consequence, it is going to hide behind the skirts
of the Administration." The front page article laid
great stress on the delay caused by the necessity of
the President's approval of the Council's decision. The
whole write-up evidenced a lack of knowledge of the
constitutional provisions governing Men's Council. As
a result it placed the members of that Council and
its chairman in a bad light.
+ * * *
■REFERENCE to the A.S.S.U. constitution would have
disabused the writer of his misinformation. Tine
preamble contains this statement. "We, the students of
Stanford University, in order to exercise power dele
gated to us by the University . . . , do ordain and
establish the following Constitution." Likewise, Ar
ticle 111, Section I, Paragraph a: "The Councils for
student control shall have such jurisdiction over all
cases of a disciplinary nature pertaining to the student
body of Stanford University which is granted to the
Student government by the President of the Uni
versity ..."
Quite obviously, the Council is obligated to ac
count for its action to the President, since he has
delegated his power (vested in him by the Board of
Trustees) to the Men's Council. Not only in matters
of consequence but in all matters, including ihe pet
tiest water-bagging offenses, this Council, in con
formity with the custom established by previous Coun
cils, has always had its decisions approved by the
President.

inconvenience of the delay, alluded to in the
front page article, has also created a wrong im
pression. The local chapters had been informed of
their penalties. They had not been delayed. The In
terfraternity Board of Control need not formulate new
initiation rules until next spring, if necessary. A
week's wait wouldn't inconvenience them. The delay
argument holds no water, yet it has caused an ill
founded and undesirable reaction toward the Men's
Council among the student body.
