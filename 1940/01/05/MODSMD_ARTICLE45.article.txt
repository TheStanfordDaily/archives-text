# Paul Muni Stars in Film Version of Hilton Novel
## 
### 
"WE AIIE NOT ALONE," now playing at (lie Stanford Theater.
Another terrific Hilton drama. Another lYltmi sensation.
Tragedy moves across (he screen in this latest talkie version of a James
Hilton novel of the same name, when Paul Muni, a Hollywood piece de
resistance, becomes a philosophical small-town English doctor who is

hanged for a crime of which he is,
innocent.
As usual, this movie-ized Hilton
novel packs a hard moral punch and
presents an almost unsolvable prob
lem. This time Jane Bryan, an Aus
trian dancer, Muni, as Dr. New
come, and soldiers of World War I
are used as characters to convey ihe
idea that war demands the lives of
men who have committed no crimes.
No tear is spared for the movie-goer,
as Hilton, Muni, and Bryan revolt
against injustice.
BOY MISUNDERSTOOD
Paralleling this main theme is the
continuity thread of the film plot.
Newcome, Muni, and Jessica, his
wife, played by Flora Robson, have
one small son, Gerald, played by
Raymond Severen. The boy, high
strung and imaginative, is com
pletely misunderstood by his rather
cold, conventional and stupid
mother.

Jane Bryan, friendless and frus
trated, attempts suicide, becomes a
patient of Muni's, and eventually
comes to the doctor's home to be a
companion for small Gerald. Miss
Bryan is painted as a wicked woman,
gossip follows, Mrs. Newcome fires
her, and ships the boy to his uncle's.
WIFE TAKES POISON
War breaks out and Miss Bryan,
an Austrian, is naturally the butt of
English small-town animosity. Muni
takes the Austrian girl to a town to

catch a train home, and while they
are gone, the wife accidentally takes
a poison pill instead of a headache
pill and dies. Muni and Miss Bryan
are accused of the crime. The au- !
dience knows, however, the young J
Gerald, the recipient of his mother's i
cruel conditionings, is unwittingly J
the cause of her death.
Much of the film must be seen i
and heard to be appreciated. Little
things such as Paul Muni's violin
playing; the last shot of Gerald mur- j
muring a German ditty; Paul Muni
on trial 'as Dr. Newcome—all these j
make this film a fine drama.
