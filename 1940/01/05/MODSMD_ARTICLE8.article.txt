# F.D.R. Names Murphy For High Court
## F.D.R. Names Murphy For High Court Appointment Gives New Dealers Edge On Supreme Tribunal 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 4 (UP). -
President Roosevelt today nomi
nated 46-year-old Frank Murphy as
an associate justice of the Supreme
Court and named 47-year-old solici
tor general Robert H. Jackson to
succeed him as attorney general.
Mr. Roosevelt thus became the
first President since the late Wil
liam Howard Taft to name five jus
tices— a majority—to the Supreme
Court. He also achieved the result
he sought unsuccessfully in the
spring of 19137 when a rebellious
Congress rejected his Supreme Court
Reorganization Plan.
SENATE TO CONCUR
Speedy Senate confirmation was
expected for both Murphy and
Jackson, despite some Republican
opposition, as well as for the coinci
dental nomination of Francis Biddle,
a judge of the Third Circuit Court
of Appeals at Philadelphia, for the
Solicitor Generalship. Only seven
Senators voted against, confirmation
of Murphy as Attorney General.
Observers saw political implica
tions in Mr. Roosevelt's re-shuffling
of his legal advisers. Some felt Mur
phy's elevation indicated he would
not be available as a Vice-Presiden
tial candidate, a role frequently as
signed to him by political pundits.
POLITICAL IMPLICATIONS
Others regarded Jackson's eleva
tion as giving some degree of au
thenticity to rumors the White
House looks with favor on the idea
of a 1940 Democratic ticket headed
by Secretary of State Cordcll Hull
with the young New Yorker as Vice-
Presidential nominee. Two years
ago Mr. Roosevelt sought privately
to boost Jackson for the New York
governorship.
Murphy, red-haired, vigorous and
energetic, will replace the late Pierce
Butler on the high bench. As was
his predecessor, he will be the only
Catholic on the tribunal, and he will
join arch-conservative Justice James
C. Mcßeynolds as the second mem
ber of the court's bachelor corps.
