### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
WTUBBORN Prime Minister Ne
k ville Chamberlain, after shak
ing up his wartime cabinet this
week-end, may decide to defy the
clamor of popular opinion against
his "sacking" of Leslie Hore-
Belisha.
No one but Chamberlain would do
this, but maybe he can get away
with it. At any rate, he seems to be
prepared to defend his cabinet jug
gling before a secret session of Par
liament. And the late war minister,
dropped suddenly after a long feud
with the British army's high com
mand,' indicated that deep-seated
origins lay beneath his resignation.
At his 17th century home in Wim
bledon Commons, he told the press
that it was "very big, much bigger
than you imagine—it had to come."
The political storm over Ilore-
Belisha's resignation, obviously a
dismissal, gathered fury. London
papers were loud in demanding a
full inquiry and explanation.
llore-Belisha was a young and
reasonably liberal statesman. When
he was named head of England's
war activities he proceeded to make
sweeping alterations in the per
sonnel of the British high command.
In fact, he promoted one general
from as low as 50th in the rank of
officers to the position of chief of
foreign operations. This irked Eng
land's staunch, old-line military
class. It struck 'at the roots of a
system which has, for centuries,
been stable, unyielding, based upon
precedent and seniority, rank and
social standing. And, in sweeping
away restrictions that have governed
the manner in which Johnny Bull
ruled the land and sea, he aroused
antagonism from the high caste
brass hats.

tranced by Liddell-Hart's the
ory that the only way to win a war
is to fight a defensive battle. Ac
cent defenses and you'll emerge on
top, even though the war may be a
long one. This is what Liddell-Hart,
who is, after all, an outstanding mil
itary theorist, has always averred.
liore-Belisha was not wholeheart
edly a convert of Liddell-Hart. And
this fact, too, may have had some
significance in bringing about his
dismissal by Chamberlain.
Parliamentary leaders are
muchly perturbed right now; they
want to avoid a political contro
versy which might get beyond con
trol. Hence they would like to
have Chamberlain summon a se
cret parliamentary session "in
public interest" to hear an expla
nation of why liore-Belisha was
replaced by Oliver Stanley. Stan
ley was a former president of the
board of trade. To say his selec
tion drew lukewarm interest is
exaggeration; lie was widely at
tacked as a "failure" in six other
cabinet posts that he's held.
Parliament is afraid that a pub
licly-aired controversy might jeop
ardize Britain's wartime unity and
lead to debate which would be ex
ploited by the Nazis. The 45-year
old Hore-Belisha received a flood of
messages from all parts of the
country, indicating that his retire
ment had caused a sensation not to
be compared with any cabinet shift
of recent years.
IT EVEN eclipsed the resignation
in February, 1938, of popular An
thony Eden as foreign secretary be
cause of his outright opposition to
Chamberlain's "appeasement." Hore-
Belisha took a stand similar to that of
Eden's, too. He indicated that, for
his part, he'd enter no discussion of
the matter before he makes a state
ment in Commons after it reassem
bles on January 16. Eden made just
such a statement explaining his
stand after he quit as foreign secre
tary; and Alfred Duff-Cooper, an
other foe of Chamberlain's appease
ment program, also explained to
Commons after he quit as First Lord
of the Admiralty.
And, at this point, the focus of
political attention is upon the Man
sion House meeting with speculation
as to just what the Prime Minister
will say about his cabinet fineagling.
