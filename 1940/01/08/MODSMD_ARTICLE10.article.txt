# SORORITY PLEDGING SCHEDULED SATURDAY
## 
### 
Starting on the second round of
candle-light dinners and luncheons,
women's rushing continues this week
with dinners tonight and luncheons
and dinners scheduled tomorrow.
Neither intermittent rains nor the
failure of the electric light system
at Roble deterred each of the Row's
nine sororities from entertaining ap
proximately 100 women each during
the scries of 4 engagements over the
week-end. Nine hundred eighty
six bids went out to new women in
Roble, Lagunita, Ventura, and the
Union units.
No new women may accept more
than two dates with the same house
during the current second period of
three engagements, according to
Jeanne Cutler, president of Pan
hellenic Council. No contact will be
permitted between freshman or
transfer women and sororities on
Wednesday, the traditional Day of
Silence.
FORMALS TO BE WORN
Rushees will be splattering up the
Row in formals Thursday and Fri
day nights for preference dinners,
while pledging has been set for Sat
urday evening. Quad clothes will be
worn at lunch tomorrow, with
dressy silks and hats if desired be
ing considered appropriate for din
ners tonight and tomorrow. Sorority
women may wear formal dresses
during the coming set of dinners.
According to custom, open house
will be held at all the sororities Sat
urday night, when the houses will
hold informal jolly-ups to introduce
new pledges to the campus.
