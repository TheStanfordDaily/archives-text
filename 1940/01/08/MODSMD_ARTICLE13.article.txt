## CAA Report Lauds West Safety Record 
### 
According to the 1939 safety re
port recently submitted by the Civil
Aeronautics Authority in Washing
ton, technically trained graduates of
Stanford have played an important
role in contributing to the remark
able safety record of U.S. air lines.
The report shows that air lines,
which are now almost universally
j equipped with California - built
! planes, had but two fatal accidents
during 1939. It is here that Stanford
comes into the picture.
EQUIPMENT IMPROVED
Highly improved equipment, as
well as numerous safety measures
adopted by air lines, was responsible
for the safety record, according to
| the C.A.A. report. Twenty-nine
| Stanford graduates are now empoyed
as engineers, designers and techni
j cians in the airplane factories of
| Southern California, from which the
bulk of the transport ships used by
the major air lines is recruited.
Most of these men are former stu
dents of the famed Guggenheim
Aerodynamics Laboratory at Stan
ford, a nationally recognized center
of research and training. Today they
are working as technical experts in
eight California aircraft factories.
CALIFORNIA LEADS
Nearly 50 per cent of all floor j
space devoted to aircraft production j
in the United States is in California, |
making the industry essentially a
local one. This situation has caused
such expansion in the state aircraft
factories that they have added new
employees at the rate of 3000 month
ly. Aircraft payrolls in the state
(exclusive of accessories and parts
manufacturers) total $46,000,000 an
nually.
One Stanford graduate is the pres
ident of his own airplane factory.
Others have designed and are de
signing the newest commercial
transports. Still others are conduct
ing research which is contributing
greater safety, speed and efficiency
to flying.
