# U.S. Speeds Fortification Of Pacific
## Army, Navy to Build Powerful Philippine, Alaskan War Bases 
### United Press 
The United States was revealed
Sunday night to be speeding
strengthening of its defenses in the
Pacific as a precaution against the
spread of the European war to the
Far East.
Military circles in Washington
disclosed that the army and navy
have decided to convert Alaska, just
across the Bering Strait from Rus
sia's Deshnet Peninsula, into one of
the world's most powerful defense
bases. At the same time it was
learned that the United States is
swiftly completing a program for
strengthening defenses in the Phil
ippines and that the fortress of Cor
regidor, guarding the entrance to
Manila Bay and the best American
base in the Orient, has been greatly
strengthened in recent weeks.
Corregidor, closed to visitors ever
since the start of the European war,
was said to be able now to withstand
a siege of six months even if cut off
from all supplies.
TO ADD Alii FORCE
A Manila dispatch said that army,
navy and air force units in the
Philippines will be strengthened and
that long-range bombing planes
easily able to strike at the Asiatic
mainland will offer additional se
curity against any possible attack
from air or sea.
The Alaskan defense plan, accord
ing to Washington reports, would be
one of the most extensive ever un
dertaken in recent years and the
army soon will ask Congress for
authority to build a huge air base at
Anchorage. The navy meanwhile
will rush work on air bases at Ko
diak and Sitka while more funds will
be asked to build a naval base at
Dutch Harbor on the island of Una
laska close by the Asiatic mainland.
STRENGTHEN WEAK LINK
These Alaskan bases would forge
new links in a defense chain reach
ing down to San Diego and to Ha
waii and complete the northern apex
of a defense triangle intended to
guarantee the United States' Pacific
frontier from any flank attack.
Alaska always has been the weak
link in the U.S. Pacific defenses and
if an Asiatic power were to attempt
an invasion of the North American
continent this northern territory
probably would be the first objec
tive.

dertaken in recent years and the
army soon will ask Congress for
authority to build a huge air base at
Anchorage. The navy meanwhile
will rush work on air bases at Ko
diak and Sitka while more funds will
be asked to build a naval base at
Dutch Harbor on the island of Una
laska close by the Asiatic mainland.
STRENGTHEN WEAK LINK
These Alaskan bases would forge
new links in a defense chain reach
ing down to San Diego and to Ha
waii and complete the northern apex
of a defense triangle intended to
guarantee the United States' Pacific
frontier from any flank attack.
Alaska always has been the weak
link in the U.S. Pacific defenses and
if an Asiatic power were to attempt
an invasion of the North American
continent this northern territory
probably would be the first objec
tive.
The United States was revealed
Sunday night to be speeding
strengthening of its defenses in the
Pacific as a precaution against the
spread of the European war to the
Far East.
Military circles in Washington
disclosed that the army and navy
have decided to convert Alaska, just
across the Bering Strait from Rus
sia's Deshnet Peninsula, into one of
the world's most powerful defense
bases. At the same time it was
learned that the United States is
swiftly completing a program for
strengthening defenses in the Phil
ippines and that the fortress of Cor
regidor, guarding the entrance to
Manila Bay and the best American
base in the Orient, has been greatly
strengthened in recent weeks.
Corregidor, closed to visitors ever
since the start of the European war,
was said to be able now to withstand
a siege of six months even if cut off
from all supplies.
TO ADD Alii FORCE
A Manila dispatch said that army,
navy and air force units in the
Philippines will be strengthened and
that long-range bombing planes
easily able to strike at the Asiatic
mainland will offer additional se
curity against any possible attack
from air or sea.
The Alaskan defense plan, accord
ing to Washington reports, would be
one of the most extensive ever un
dertaken in recent years and the
army soon will ask Congress for
authority to build a huge air base at
Anchorage. The navy meanwhile
will rush work on air bases at Ko
diak and Sitka while more funds will
be asked to build a naval base at
Dutch Harbor on the island of Una
