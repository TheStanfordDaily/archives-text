# Stojkovich Sets Sign-up Deadline
## 
### 
With tlit; sign-up deadline set for
fi o'clock tonight, competition in bas
ketball and handball, the first sports
on the winter quarter intramural
program, gets underway this week,
according to Intramural Manager
Andy Stojkovich.
The intramural program is ex
pected to be much smoother from
now on because of the ruling made
in last week's intramural meeting
which is to the effect that any team
that forfeits two games in any one
sport or three games in different
sports will be barred from all fur
ther competition for the remainder
of the year.
The advisability of barring any
Stanford letterman from competi
tion in intramurals was discussed,
but it was decided to leave the
present rule unchanged, which
means that a letterman may com
pete in all intramural sports except
the one in which he made his letter.
The University of Alaska has an
enrollment of over 1000.
