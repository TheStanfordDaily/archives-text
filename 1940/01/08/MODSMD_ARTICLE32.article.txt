# Casabamen Concentrate On Opener
## Week Lay-off Ends As 'Last Lap' Begins For Card Hoopsters 
### 
The longest period Stanford's bas
ketballers have gone or will go with
out practice lor the rest of the sea
son ends this afternoon when Ev
erett Dean puts his cagers through
their first drill since last Tuesday
afternoon.
The last time the 12 barnstorming
cagers handled the ball was in
Madison, Wis., where the Cardinals
whipped the University of Wiscon
sin, 39-26, Wednesday night. Since
then the team has been on its way
home, pulling in Saturday morning,
and then Coach Dean immediately
declared a two-day additional vaca
tion from their basketball duties.
However, from now on \n the cag
ers will be concentrating on the
Southern Division of the Coast Con
ference's basketball opening this
Friday and Saturday night with
U.C.L.A. here.
BRUINS, CARDS CLASH
While the Bruins and Indians clash
in the Pavilion, the Bears and Tro
jans, who are favorites to fight it
out again for the conference crown,
tangle in Los Angeles. Cal moves
to the Farm the following week for
the first of the four grudge games.
Although Wilbur John's Uclans
are said to be headed for their nth
straight doormat title, Coach
Dean is inclined to believe that the
Bruins with dusky Jackie Robinson
will be a scrappier and tougher team
than last year's. And last season
they put up several hair-raising bat
tles, once leading their Trojan rivals
until the last five minutes.
It has been a long time since the
Bruin has won a conference game or
trimmed the Trojans. So with a new
coach and a flock of untried mate
rial, they are being named an un
known quintet and no one is dis
counting the possibility of their com
ing through at least once this year.
DEAN PREDICTS
Reminiscing over the barnstorming
trip, Coach Dean thought the 45-43
struggle with Baltimore was the
toughest but predicted that Dart
mouth and Nebraska, teams which
they deleated and lost to, would be
stronger as the season goes on.
Although both Don Williams and
Forest Anderson were outstanding i
in their offensive play, Dean was i
high in his praise of Leon Lafaille, I
who "was a better ball player on the |
trip than any time this or last year." {
A forward, Lafaille will be a valu- |
abie reserve.
Williams showed tremendous im
provement over last year and scored
most of his 90 points inside the foul
circle. Anderson had two bad |
gamesâ€”against Nebraska and Wis- j
consin, but otherwise topped or
shared scoring honors with Wil
liams.
Ken Davidson and Bill Cowden, j
the first-string guards, were con- '
sistently good, while Dick Taylor!
and Bob Penn shared the center job. j
Taylor was a tow*er of strength in 1
controlling the ball off the enemy !
backboard.
