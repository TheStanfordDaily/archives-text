### JERRY MAYER 
P.C.C. MOGULS
APPOINT CZAR
Swiftly, decisively—but not alto
gether surprisingly—the high moguls
of the Pacific Coast Conference,
meeting for four days last week in
Los Angeles, created the position of
"Commissioner of Athletisc for the
Pacific Coast Conference" and named
Edwin N. Atherton to the position.
Atherton, whose 2,000.(100 - word
survey of athletic conditions in the
conference led to his appointment,
was hailed as the only logical man
to fill the position. His studies
into the situation, which took bet
ter than two years and cost ap
proximately $40,000. fully qualifies
him for the task of riding herd on
the ten conference schools.
Atherton's survey supposedly "re
vealed" eye-raising tactics on the
part of alumni and athletic authori
ties at the various schools, such tac
tics directed toward the dastardly
end of luring good athletes—prin
cipally football players—into the re
spective schools represented by said
alumni and athletic authorities.
So the moguls forthwith passed
several stringent restrictions as to
the length to which alumni and
school authorities may go in their
quest for outstanding football tal
ent. It was decided that 110 pros
pective athlete may he entertained
in any way, shape, or manner.
If this regulation is violated, the
athlete becomes ineligible at the
school whose representatives, wheth
er official or not, tried to "entice"
him. The question is brought up
that this might work a hardship 011
some father who is an alumnus of
some Conference school and would
like his football-playing son to fol
low in his footsteps. Maybe the
conference will enact a separate rule
for such a situation.
FOOTBALL MAY BE
DOOMED ON* COAST
It's perfectly all light with us if
the Pacific Coast Conference wants
to crack down on poor young men
whose only chance of getting a col
lege education rests in their football
prowess.
Perhaps the Pacific Coast Confer
ence is to be commended for going
"honest."
BUT, if these various rules cur
tailing the "rushing" of football
players are carried out by the con
ference under the eagle-eye of
Commissioner Atherton (and the
meeting seemed sincere in a desire
to have the rules stringently ob
served), then the Pacific Coast
Conference might as well kiss
good-bye to big-time football.
The Coast Conference colleges
would be but lambs being led to
the slaughterhouse, the Rose Bowl
game would be a farce. Forcer

tainly none of the faculty representa- ;
tives who make up the annual Pa- |
cific Coast Conference meeting is I
naive enough to think that football j
players are going to take a long- I
shot chance at attending a school !
where they have no idea as to what I
is in store for them, and have no;
way of finding out.
* * *
Personally, it is my belief that the j
same practices will continue as have \
in the past. Possibly they will be
shielded more, but they will be
continued. You can't take ten
schools who have been subsidized as j
much as the Coast Conference j
schools have, and make them do a !
complete turnabout at an instant's I
notice.
I see no reason for believing such ;
practices will be abated in the near
future. Perhaps, with Atherton in
the driver's seat, the P.C.C. will I
eventually turn "honest," but while I
the process is going on there will be j
charges, counter-charges, and gen- ;
eral enmity all around.
No matter how much the other j
nine schools, including Stanford, }
try to level at U.S.C.. I'm still put- |
ting my money on them to con
tinue dominating the sports scene, i
In fact, to my mind, that's all
the present regulations are pointed J
at—keeping U.S.C. down.
Remember, you various members
of the Conference, what a helluva j
mess you'd be in if the Trojans de- I
cided they didn't like being pushed |
around and quit the conference.
Just think it over.
