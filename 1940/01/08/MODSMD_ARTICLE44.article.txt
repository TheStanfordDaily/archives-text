# And Still No Coach
## 
### 
THE doors of the B.A.C. were locked and
sealed yesterday. Even the sharpest-eyed,
nosiest-for-news reporter could not fathom what
was going on in the conference room where
nine men were sitting around a table, puffing
on cigarettes and cigars, and trying to pick a
new head football coach for Stanford University.
Only one fact is known: their terse announce
ment that the Board has not yet been able to
come to any decision. With 40 or 50 prospects
on the list of men who had filed applications or
who had been interviewed, it is little wonder
that the nine voting members could not make
up their minds between 2:30 and 9 o'clock on
a single rainy Sunday.
Dr. Thomas A. Storey had just returned from
a trip to the East, during which he had inter
viewed a number of candidates. Professor Wil
liam B. Owens had dashed back from the meet
ing of the Pacific Coast Conference in Los An
geles, where he had numerous opportunities to
contact football coaches from all over the coun
try who were convening there. The B.A.C.'s
committee on staff had not yet had an oppor
tunity to hold a final meeting.
However, despite these disadvantages, the
members of the Board did have several opin
ions to guide them.
Various alumni clubs had sent in the con
sensus of their members, differing widely, of
course, according to locality.
The members of the Block S Society, which
met lastweek-end in San Francisco, went on
record as favoring either Buck Shaw or Dud
DeGroot for the coaching job.
And the students of Stanford University, the
men who play on the field and who sit in the
rooting section, voted in last Friday's Daily poll
in favor of Shaw, with DeGroot a close second
and all other candidates trailing far behind.
Whether the Board of Athletic Control will
be influenced to any extent by these senti
ments is questionable. Its members are in a
position to take the view that they are experts,
far better qualified to select a coach than the
straw-ballot voter who has had little oppor
tunity to study the situation at first hand.
At any rate all is silence until the B.A.C.
reconvenes next Friday evening. And there is
no guarantee that the mystery will be dispelled
then, for Dr. Wilbur must okay the Board's se
lection before it is made public.
Thus, for another week Stanford is without a
football coach for the 1940 season.
The vacancy makes fine material for Daily
editorials and sports columns in the San Fran
cisco papers.
But the student body is becoming a bit im
patient.
Who is going to be the new football coach?
Who is going to be the new track coach?
Who is going to be the new president?
Too many mysteries.

DeGroot for the coaching job.
And the students of Stanford University, the
men who play on the field and who sit in the
rooting section, voted in last Friday's Daily poll
in favor of Shaw, with DeGroot a close second
and all other candidates trailing far behind.
Whether the Board of Athletic Control will
be influenced to any extent by these senti
ments is questionable. Its members are in a
position to take the view that they are experts,
far better qualified to select a coach than the
straw-ballot voter who has had little oppor
tunity to study the situation at first hand.
At any rate all is silence until the B.A.C.
reconvenes next Friday evening. And there is
no guarantee that the mystery will be dispelled
then, for Dr. Wilbur must okay the Board's se
lection before it is made public.
Thus, for another week Stanford is without a
football coach for the 1940 season.
The vacancy makes fine material for Daily
editorials and sports columns in the San Fran
cisco papers.
But the student body is becoming a bit im
patient.
Who is going to be the new football coach?
Who is going to be the new track coach?
Who is going to be the new president?
Too many mysteries.
THE doors of the B.A.C. were locked and
sealed yesterday. Even the sharpest-eyed,
nosiest-for-news reporter could not fathom what
was going on in the conference room where
nine men were sitting around a table, puffing
on cigarettes and cigars, and trying to pick a
new head football coach for Stanford University.
Only one fact is known: their terse announce
ment that the Board has not yet been able to
come to any decision. With 40 or 50 prospects
on the list of men who had filed applications or
who had been interviewed, it is little wonder
that the nine voting members could not make
up their minds between 2:30 and 9 o'clock on
a single rainy Sunday.
Dr. Thomas A. Storey had just returned from
a trip to the East, during which he had inter
viewed a number of candidates. Professor Wil
liam B. Owens had dashed back from the meet
ing of the Pacific Coast Conference in Los An
geles, where he had numerous opportunities to
contact football coaches from all over the coun
try who were convening there. The B.A.C.'s
committee on staff had not yet had an oppor
tunity to hold a final meeting.
However, despite these disadvantages, the
members of the Board did have several opin
ions to guide them.
Various alumni clubs had sent in the con
sensus of their members, differing widely, of
course, according to locality.
The members of the Block S Society, which
met lastweek-end in San Francisco, went on
record as favoring either Buck Shaw or Dud
DeGroot for the coaching job.
