TWO hundred Roble women will put on their
pretty clothes and trip delicately up the Row
this week, and then run home, sit in their rooms,
and worry like mad. And for what?
They want to be pledged. They want to join
a sorority. They want to become a part of Stan
ford's substitute for cafe society. They want to
wear a tag saying that they are blue-bloods.
They have been around; they know that a pure
bred dog costs more money, and they think it
is logical to assume that a blue-blood woman
will have more money spent on her.
That, of course, is being unfair. The fresh

man women don't work it out nearly that
clearly.
But the sororities have the drop on these
freshman women to begin with. In the first
place, the whole idea of social success and
failure hinging on joining a sorority has been
made clear to them long before they came to
Stanford. It is a generally known and believed
concept founded on conditions existing when
Cousin Clara went to college 10 years ago.
And the sororities take this, add an element
of competition, and get the 200 Roble girls mak
ing the rounds to fight and weep for the 100 or
so available sorority bids. And throw the blank
ness of adolescent despair over the 50 who are
not rushed at all.
Now sororities themselves are not wrong, nor
are they merely unnecessary collegiate ap
pendages. But the idea behind them is wrong.
That is not as much of a paradox as it may
seem. Sororities are entirely justified as small
living groups existing for and because of social
reasons, as places where certain girls like to
live.
But the idea that Row women are superior
socially to Hall women is false and ridiculous.
The point is, Roble, with all this rushing busi
ness going on this week, just take it easy. If
you want to join a sorority because of the sisters
living there now, work all your tricks, and see
what can be done.
But if you want to join a house because it has
a terrific national reputation or because Aunt
Theda back in Kansas thinks you have been
sold down the river if you don't let the Row
sign you up, forget it. Remember, you are
living at Stanford iu 1940, and not back in
Kansas in 1925.â€” D.J.
