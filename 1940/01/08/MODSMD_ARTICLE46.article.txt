PAGING THE MARX BROTHERS
/ 4NE of the more amazing farces of recent years has
been overlooked by Hollywood comedians. The
Marx Brothers' gag-men have certainly missed the
boat. They have used the opera, the Olympics, and
the circus. But it is a tribute to their blindness that
they have missed Geneva. The sophisticated tenacity
of the "concord of nations" is really a farce to behold.
Through war and rebellion, failure and insincerity
the knickerbockered diplomats have stuck by their
starched shirts. Grimly, resolutely, they have refused
to leave their high-sounding phrases in the face of
uncontrollable opposition to peace. Unflinchingly they
have marched in and out of the council room. And
all that without using any stronger weapons for peace
than strong words. By Jove (as Sir Samuel Hoare
has probably fearlessly remarked any number of
times) that takes nerve!
When Japan first invaded Manchukuo a good many
people wondered why the League didn't boycott Japan
and refuse to sell them war materials. But how much
more fitting it was to severely reprimand the aggres
sor, thus forcing drastic action: Japan resigned from
the League. That was showing those nasty war
mongers!
*** ' *
and Italy thought they could success
w fully oppose the will of the League of Nations, too.
But they found out differently. With the same mili
tant verbosity the Geneva debating society waged a
merciless war of words on the Fascist powers, forcing
them into Japan's hapless state of resignation. Not
resignation from their fields of conquest, t« be sure.
But resignation from the League of Nations. There
was a triumph, a telling blow for peace!
But the League's most glorious victory was saved
for the time in 1939 when the world exclaims, "Peace
on earth; good will toward men!" Incensed over Soviet
Russia's attack on Finland, the League Council met in
solemn session. They heard the eloquent plea of Fin
land's delegate. And then, with the unanimity born
of insignificance, they struck with lightning speed
They expelled Russia from the League of Nations!
The drama and suspense in such world-shaking
moves can hardly be overemphasized. In fact, they
can hardly be emphasized enough—except by the Marx
Brothers. I'll bet they could do it.
The futility of the world's first great experiment in
international civilization is discouraging enough to
prejudice a mildly skeptical man against all hopes for
world government. But those of us whose entire su
perstructure of beliefs depends upon world progress
still somehow manage to hope. It's almost startling,
when you stop to examine the frailty of the evidence
in favor of hope. Maybe It's just because a world full
of dramas like "The Mark Brothers at Geneva" would
eventually get boring. .
