# CAMPUS OPINION
## WHAT'S IN A NAME 
### 
r | I HE EDITOR. SIR:
During the American Revolution, Britishers were
annoyed by a serialized Campus Opinion appearing in
New England papers. Signed "Publius," these letters
to the editor were seditious, subversive, anti-status-quo
propaganda versus the Mother Country. Local redcoat
Dies committees fretted, but "Publius" was never re
vealed. Modern scholars (check Professor Savelle on
this) believe that the letter-writer was Sam Adams.
John Hancock, on the other hand, signed his John
Hancock to the Declaration of Indcpedence in such
bold and flourishing form that "King George can read
it without his spectacles." Said Declaration is still
enshrined in our hearts, as well as in the Archives
Building at Washington.
Three recent issues of the Daily which I have at
hand contain nine Campus Opinions (30 column inches)
of which only two (four and one-half column inches)
are signed with the proper names of the authors. Four
of those remaining must be known to the future only
as "P.C.," "R.H.M., "A.M.D.G.," and "S.G.O. of the C.
Committee." The others cagily identify themselves as
"Some Club Men," and "We Who Have Lost Our
Voices." Plus that firebrand, "'41."
Can vou not visualize the future? Blue books
signed, "No Aid Given or Received. We Who Are About
to Die." Bawlout entries such as, "One o' de Boys.
Somewhere in Nevada. '41. Up the Row." And at
dances: "Sorry, but I promised this one to 'Constant
Reader'."
Of course, a policy of printing all names on letters
to the editor would blight the crop. However, if a
I vogue of candidness could be started, rousing bull
sessions and intelligent conversation would be stimu
lated. Here's hoping.
