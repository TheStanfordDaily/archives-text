# Grown-Up Deanna Durbin Clicks In Cinderella Role
## 
### 
FIRST LOVE, now playing at the Fox Stanford.
A more impossible group of people or events could not have been eon- i
eeived by Universal for the story of "First Love," in whieh Deanna Durbin ■
grows up. But it is meant to be and is a Cinderella story done at a fast- j

moving pace and sprinkled with,
light dialogue and Deanna's singing.
The actual plot if a variation on
the Cinderella theme, complete with
grand ball and lost slipper. Deanna's
Prince Charming is Robert Stark,
who delivers her much-publicized
first screen kiss. He handles his part
in an easy stride and his good looks
make Miss Durbin's actions ex
plainable.
HOWARD TAKES HONORS
In the role of the son of the soci
ety relatives of Deanna, Lewis How
ard lazily sailed through his part to
take top honors in the supporting
cast. A large part of his success was
due to the way the role was handled
but Howard merits loud praise for
keeping the part from being boring.
The step-sisters in the original
Cinderella fairy tale evolved into a
cousin in the form of Helen Parrish.
She was thoroughly nasty, villain
ous, and beautiful.
DEANNA MATURES
Three years ago Universal found
a gold mine in the person of De
anna Durbin and they are still draw
ing on the original streak of ore.
"First Love" marks the end of De
anna's "difficult" middle-teen age
and she graduates into a grown
woman with a grown, mature voice.
The only thng that could keep a
moviegoer in search of an enjoyable
evening away from the Stanford in
the next few days is the double bill.
It is Joe E. Brown's latest epic
called "Beware of Spooks." The
picture was saved from the cutting
room floor by the sequence in a
beach spook-house, in which Mr.
Brown becomes utterly lost.—Spra
