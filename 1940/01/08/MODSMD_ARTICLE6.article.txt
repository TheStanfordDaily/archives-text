# 3121 Tells of His Troubles In Taking 1000 Calls Daily
## 
### BUD AMES 
"Go back and sleep it off, chum.
That buzzer rang in the room below
you."
Such was tho Sunday morning
| greeting of the Toyon telephone op-
I erntor. His more common name is
J 3121, and he lives in a little 4 by 10-
foot cigar bov room cached away on
Toyon's first floor.
Dictator of this switchboard which
controls the destinies of Branner.
Toyon, Union, and Encina is William
Rigden, who, although he has seen
better than 70 years, still rides his
shiny red bicycle to work in puttees
regularly six days a week. He
served about 15 years in the Austra
lian navy, 1
His working hours run from 7 a.m.
to 3 p.m., at which time one of the
11 student operators takes over for
a four-hour shift. These students
keep the lines open until 11 o'clock
at night.
"Working in four-hour shifts
really tightens up your nerves," a
student, operator .explained. "After
I close the board down at night I
can't sleep or even study for two
hours. It's the queerest feeling."
Heart of the switchboard system is
! a huge wall panel of neatly labeled
| buttons and signal holes one to a
I room, or a total of 520 in the four
! halls. When a roomer answers the
I operator's call, a little white flag ap-

! pears in the proper hole, signaling
the operator to plug in.
Bu.siest times are at 8 o'clock in
the evening and at noon, technically
j named "buzzer" and "noon" shifts,
! when two men are required to run
|the board.
"It's strange, but after lunch the
j telephoning slacks off," the operator
1 added. "And then at exactly 5:22 the
! whole board lights up like a Christ
| mas tree, and business booms until
j dinner."
He also explained that at present
| the board is not working at capacity,
j since strong-arm students have com
' pletely torn phones from the walls
j of the second floor Encina and the
I third floor Branner booths. Such an
occurrence takes place about once
every two months.
And now for those numbers, so
| much a part of the telephone busi
! ness. The operator wasn't certain,
! but he estimated th;it approximately
j and at least 1000 calls passed
I through his wires every day. The
j number naturally jumps during
' rainy weather.
"And speaking of calls," our
phone-friend went on, "let me here
explode the belief that operators
! listen in on conversations. We can
but we don't. We're so busy that
; we would go nuts trying to pick out

Such was tho Sunday morning
| greeting of the Toyon telephone op-
I erntor. His more common name is
J 3121, and he lives in a little 4 by 10-
foot cigar bov room cached away on
Toyon's first floor.
Dictator of this switchboard which
controls the destinies of Branner.
Toyon, Union, and Encina is William
Rigden, who, although he has seen
better than 70 years, still rides his
shiny red bicycle to work in puttees
regularly six days a week. He
served about 15 years in the Austra
lian navy, 1
His working hours run from 7 a.m.
to 3 p.m., at which time one of the
11 student operators takes over for
a four-hour shift. These students
keep the lines open until 11 o'clock
at night.
"Working in four-hour shifts
really tightens up your nerves," a
student, operator .explained. "After
I close the board down at night I
can't sleep or even study for two
hours. It's the queerest feeling."
Heart of the switchboard system is
! a huge wall panel of neatly labeled
| buttons and signal holes one to a
I room, or a total of 520 in the four
! halls. When a roomer answers the
I operator's call, a little white flag ap-

! pears in the proper hole, signaling
the operator to plug in.
Bu.siest times are at 8 o'clock in
the evening and at noon, technically
j named "buzzer" and "noon" shifts,
! when two men are required to run
|the board.
"It's strange, but after lunch the
j telephoning slacks off," the operator
1 added. "And then at exactly 5:22 the
! whole board lights up like a Christ
| mas tree, and business booms until
j dinner."
He also explained that at present
| the board is not working at capacity,
j since strong-arm students have com
' pletely torn phones from the walls
j of the second floor Encina and the
I third floor Branner booths. Such an
occurrence takes place about once
every two months.
And now for those numbers, so
| much a part of the telephone busi
! ness. The operator wasn't certain,
! but he estimated th;it approximately
j and at least 1000 calls passed
I through his wires every day. The
j number naturally jumps during
