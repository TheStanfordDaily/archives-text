### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
OHESIDENT ROOSEVELT gave
his formula for a New Deal suc
cess in the presidential election this
autumn. But, he was careful to
shield his third-term plans when he
warned Democratic leaders that the
party must cling to the liberal poli
cies that attracted independent vot
ers in 1932 and 1936 if it is to win
again.
The President was speaking to the
cream of the capital's democracy at
the $100-a-plate Jackson Day din
ner—and to thousands of radio lis
teners throughout the nation.
The American people, Roosevelt
said, recognize two facts today.
The world outside our hemisphere
is "in really had shape." And this
fact is so big that few people have
actually grasped its meaning, so
big that "our little partisan
squabbles are shameful in (lie light
of it." He said that the nation has
made "great gains" in economic
prosperity and in the security of
individual citizens and that these
gains must not he "chipped away."

the most part his remarks
were good-humored, but his
warning that the Democi-atic party
must continue to earn the support
of liberal Republicans, Progressives
and others who flocked to its stand
ards in 1932 and remained there in
1936 was blunt and forceful. It was
an unmistakeable declaration, once
and for all, that Democrats cannot
hope to win with a conservative
candidate for the White House. At
the same time it was an intelligent
analysis of a fact that political the
orists have realized for years—that
it was not Democrats who elected
Roosevelt in '32 and '36, but inde
pendent Republicans and liberals
from other groups.
This is a public recognition of
an enormously significant trend in
current politics, a tendency for
public interest to center more in
government and less in party af
filiation. One need only look at
the record of the last few national
elections. The story is there—more
independent voters, less old-line
party stalwarts; and, hence, an at
tendant increase in attention to
important national issues, such as
social legislation, and a decrease in
blind party patriotism.
More and more the voter of today
is interested in platforms and poli
cies; less and less often one hears,
"My suthui was a Democrat (or Re
publican) and so I am." Roosevelt
pleaded guilty to the "soft impeach
ment." that too many persons in his
administration are not active party
Democrats, but explained that he
believes in party organization only
in proportion to its proper place in
government.

IJOOSEVELT look as the theme for
his .speech that belief that "the
common denominator of our great
men in public life has not been
mere allegiance to one political
party, but the disinterested devotion
with which they've tried to serve
the whole country, and the relative
unimportance they've ascribed to
politics, compared with the para
mount. importance of government."
This seems to indicate, in a round
about way, that the door to a third
term is still open to Roosevelt. He
apparently hasn't made up his
mind.

Because they did "the big job," he
said, Alexander Hamilton, Thomas
Jefferson, Andrew Jackson and Ab
raham Lincoln were his heroes —
Hamilton probably because he
brought stability out of the chaos of
currency and banking difficulties;
Jefferson because he established the
new republic as a real democracy;
Lincoln because he made possible a
united country, and Jackson because
he saved the economic democracy of
ihe union for its westward expan
sion into a great nation.
