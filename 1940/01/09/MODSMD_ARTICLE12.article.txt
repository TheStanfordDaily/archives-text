# Mrs. David Starr Jordan Recalls Early Days on Farm
## 
### BUID AMES 
Mrs. David Starr Jordan swung open her front door and glanced up at
the prospective interviewer and two burdened camera men.
"Come in out of the rain, gentlemen," she said crisply. "And before
we get started I have a large trunk I want you to help move into the
basement." A little startled, the Daily men moved to the trunk and hauled

it to the basement.
Mrs. Jordan settled her small self
—she is about five feet tall—on her I
couch and began to chat informally.
The University, she said, had made
so many and such great changes
since 1891 when she first came to
Palo Alto with her husband, Dr.
David Starr Jordan, Stanford's first
president. Sadly, relations are no
longer as close as then —when Palo
Alto was just a flag station, two
benches back to back under a can
vas canopy.
MET AT CORNELL
Ware, Massachusetts, was her
birthplace and Worcester had been
her early home. It was at Cornell
that she met Dr. Jordan, then presi
dent of Indiana University. They
were married in 1887.
"We spent our honeymoon read
ing proofs on some of Dr. Jordan's'
scientific sketches," she said with a
smile. "Soon after we came to
Stanford, and I have never since had
any desire to live back East."
ACTIVE IN CLUB
Always active, she is at .present
putting in order papers, plans, and
correspondence left, by Dr. Jordan.
In addition to acting as his literary
secretary and writing associate, she
! has also been active in the Faculty,
| Palo Alto, and Mothers' Clubs, hu
i mane societies, the English Speaking
| Union, and a score of other organi
zations.
"But a severe sore throat has kept
me indoors of late," she continued.
| "I fear all the flag waving they are
J doing in the motion pictures now
: adays. But I will also say that the
j whole country is taking this present
| war situation differently than World
; War I. Feeling against war has
' grown enormously during the last
j ten years."
Inevitably her recollections drifted
i to the Stanford earthquake.
| "If it had to be, I wouldn't have
| missed it for the world," she said
| strangely. "It was a supreme and
! solemn experience. I was knocked
! flat three times trying to get out my
j bedroom door—just ten feet away,
i The next night everybody slept un
| comfortably outside, fearing another
| quake. But I slept inside because I
j preferred dying in my bed to spend
i ing an uncomfortable night out
j side."
PLANS MADE
Across the road from her present
j home stands the old Jordan home
j built by them in the spring of 1894.
j Senator Stanford, she confided, had
planned to build them a president's
| home in 1893. At last the contractor
came with the final contracts, but
busy Senator Stanford sent him away
and told him to return the next day.
That night, the Senator died.
Confined though she is, Mrs. Jor
! dan keeps constant and close touch
' with the campus.
"I favor Dud DeGroot as head
coach," she said with another smile,
brushing back a gray hair. "I met
him back when he attended Stan
ford."
