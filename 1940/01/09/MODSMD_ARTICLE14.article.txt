# Rain Reported Above Average

### 
Rainfall figures for the first week
in 1940 show that 6.65 inches of rain
had fallen at 9 o'clock yesterday
morning, which is more than the
average rainfall for the whole month
of January, according to A. D. Brad
bury, associate professor of physics.
This is 1.25 inches more than last
year at this time, he said.
Professor Bradbury declined to
comment on whether or not the
rain will continue. The San Fran
cisco Weather Bureau also took a
back seat on the question, saying
merely, "continued unsettled, signs
of clearing," in its daily forecast.
Cold cases have shown no marked
increase since the rain began, ac
cording to Dr. William Shepard,
Men's Health Service physician. At
the health service there have been
fewer cases than usual, and reports
from the Men's and Women's Rest
Homes show no unusual number.
Five out of the six students at the
hospital have colds.
No work is being done on the
Hoover War Library except for a
little carpentry work inside. The
work foreman stated that no prog
ress can be made on the structure
until the rain ceases. Work was also
suspended on the University Ave
nue-Palm Drive underpass in Palo
Alto.
