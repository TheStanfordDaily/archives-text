### JERRY BRUCKER 
Over 70 rowing enthusiasts were
present in the Women's Clubhouse

and indicated that, a Stanford crew
could be on the water before the
end of this quarter.
The group plans to take the mat
ter before Ex Committee at the reg
ular meeting tomorrow night.
Cole, as acting chairman, explain
ed in detail the foundation work
that had been done last quarter by
himself and two freshmen, Lee
Peake and Bob SchaefTer.
"There is no finer sport than row
the proposed boat club shouldn't
succeed if the students support it."
Continuing, he explained the ten
tative organization of the club and
the difficulties that "must be faced,
but can be overcome if student
support is firm."
Harry Maloney, director of minor
sports, gave a short talk about the
success of Stanford crews before the
sport was abandoned here in 1921.
He expressed the opinion that,
"There is no finer sports than row
ing."
Jack Yates, former assistant crew
coach at Cal talked about the prac
tical aspects and possibilities of a
boat club and crew at Stanford.
"The Farm," he said, "has as good
a set-up for rowing as any school
on the Coast."
Jack Hoeffer, a former California
crewman now in Business School
here, told the group about rowing at
Cal and the organization of the
Varsity Rowing Club at Berkeley.
He also remarked on the growing
popularity of rowing throughout the
country in the last few years.
Howard Dawson, who coached
the U.C.L.A. freshman crew last
spring, discussed the growth of
rowing at Westwood, where, he said,
conditions were much worse for the
sport than they are here.
Kirk Smith and Lawrence Burn
ley, former Cal crewmen now doing
graduate work here were intro
duced. Smith stroked the victorious
Bear eight at Poughkeepsie last
spring.
