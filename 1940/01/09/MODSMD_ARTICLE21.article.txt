# A.S.U. Elects Encina Frosh New President
## Richard Cecil Named Head; Lowe Remains As Vice-President 
### 
"As citizens of a nation, Ameri
can Student Union members see the
importance of youth to the nation."
Fulfilling to the letter this cardinal
point in their organization, mem
bers of the Stanford chapter of the
A.S.U. afTorded the campus its sec
ond surprise in a week by elevating
Richard P. '"Dick" Cecil, Encina
freshman, to fill the presidential va
cancy left by the sudden resigna
tion of Andries Deinum, according
to an announcement yesterday.
Bob Low remains as vice
president of the chapter, and Carl
Reynolds was named treasurer at
the same meeting.
PREPARES STATEMENT
Cecil, a frosh from New York
City, following his election refused
to release immediately any state
ment concerning the future policy
or plans of the A.S.U. He said that
such a statement is being prepared,
and that it will be ready Wednesday
or Thursday.
"Included in the statement," Cecil
said, "will be a resolution passed by
the local chapter concerning the
"recent refusal of the National A.S.U.
Convention to brand Russia the ag
gressor in its present conflict with
Finland."
Deinum's recent surprise resigna
tion from presidential duties was
caused by "too many other activities
and general disinterest growing out
of a lack of co-operation."
WORK TOO IIARI)
Effective with his retirement from
the position, Deinum made the fol
lowing statement, "The people who
have the time and money are not
sufficiently interested in the A.S.U.
and do not do anything about it, and
the ones who are interested have to
work too hard and haven't enough
money to do the work."
Soon after he resigned, Deinum de
nied the reason for his action was
due wholly or in part to the attitude
of the National A.S.U. Convention
concerning the Russo-Finn confla
gration when they refused to rec
ognize Russia as the aggressor.
