A conference of C.1.0. union lead
ers in Southwestern Washington to

Dick IÂ«iw. wife of an Aberdeen labor
official, the "first casualty in a reign
of terror" in Grays Harbor.
Reflecting the bitterness which had
made this city a "hot spot" in Pacific

conference issued a statement de
manding a federal grand jury in
vestigation of alleged "vigilante"
methods.
