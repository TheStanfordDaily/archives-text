# Italy Signs Anti-Russian Balkan Pact
## Military Defensive Plan with Hungary May Hinder Soviet 
### United Press 
Italy and Hungary were reported
Monday night to have agreed on a
defensive military alliance, aimed
directly at any possible Russian in
vasion of the Balkans, but there
were strong doubts that Mussolini
had entered the hard and fast com
mitments usually contained in armed
alliances.
There is no doubt that II Duce is
arming at a rapid pace, not so much
against the danger of embroilment in
the western war as against Russia's
expansion, but it is probable that any
defense agreement he may have
reached with Hungary has many
strings attached to it.
FORM RUSS BARRIER
Ever since the outbreak of the
European war Mussolini has been
striving cautiously to bring the
Balkan and Danubian states into a
bloc that will form a barrier against
any Soviet thrust into southeastern
Europe. But first of all he must find
a basis for peaceful relations among
the Balkan states themselves, a
means of ending their bickerings
over frontiers and minorities.
The reported agreement with
Hungary may be the first real step
in this direction.
FINNS WIN AGAIN
The war in Finland picked up
after a , brief lull and the Finnish
high command announced that an
other Russian army division of 15,-
000 to 18,000 men had been destroyed
with "many thousands" killed and
much booty captured along the
frontier just east of the town of
Suomusalmi.
The Russian 44th division, it was
said, was destroyed in almost the
same spot and by the same guerilla
entrapment actions that were cred
ited with annihilating the Red army's
163 rd division 12 days ago. The 44th
division, it was said, was surrounded
at the eastern end of Lake Kianta
near the town of Raate, which lies
only about a mile from the Russian
border.
U.S. LOANS TO FINNS
In Washington there was increas
ing support for a proposed $60,000,-
000 American loan to Finland, asked
in a bill introduced by Senator Pren
tiss M. Brown, Democrat of Michi
gan. Senator Carter Glass said he
favored the loan "even if we have to
borrow" the money. The State De
partment announced that it had noti
fied the League of Nations in Geneva
that the United, States is helping
Finland through the Red Cross and
other relief agencies.
Limited food rationing went into
effect Monday throughout Britain
and Northern Ireland, with the royal
family setting the example lor 47,-
000,000 men, women and children,
and there was little grumbling. To
day Prime Minister Neville Cham
berlain may tell the British people
in a speech at London's Mansion
House to prepare to make more
sacrifices, possibly warning that, be
fore long, Britain may have clothing
rationing such as Germany has al
ready in an effort to conserve raw
materials.
The ousting of Leslie Hore-Belisha
as British War Minister still had its
repercussions and there were pub
lished hints in London that a Min
istry of National Defense might be
set up under Winston Churchill. First
Lord of the Admiralty, who freely
criticized Hore-Belisha's work. La
boritcs were getting ready to demand
the immediate recalling of Parlia
ment, scheduled to remain in re
cess until Jan. 16, to hear an expla
nation from Chamberlain as to why
Hore-Belisha was dismissed.
