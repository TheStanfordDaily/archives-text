SO. FELLOWS
On page 4 of today's Daily appears
a Campus Opinion written by Ken
Cuthbertson, Stan Hiserman, and
Hamp Pool, the .three student rep
resentatives to I he nine-man Board
oi Athletic Control, in which they
take exception to a "challenge"
made by me to the effect that they
should base their actions in the de
termination of the new football
coach "strictly in accord,? with the
results of the student poll recently
conducted by The Stanford Daily.
In defense of my own point of
view, I am taking the liberty of
answering the Campus Opinion.
First of all, I in no way implied
(hat the issue I presented was in
the form of a "challenge." It was
a simple statement of fact that in
asmuch as Cuthbertson. Hiserman,
and Pool were elected by the stu
dents.' they represented the stu
dents on the B.A.C. I think no
one can deny that conclusion.
Therefore, as student representa
tives, it seems to me that they are
"morally obligated" to carry out the
wishes of Stanford's undergraduate
population to as great a degree as
possible. I may be wrong; perhaps
1 misunderstand the meaning of the
word "representative." I think not,
however.
The students voted overwhelm
ingly for Buck Shaw and Dud De-
Groot, two local men, which per
haps adds substance to the declara
tion under section three (3) of the
above-mentioned Campus Opinion
that they "have been exposed to a
locally limited amount of publicity
and propaganda regarding the choice
of the new coach."
Hill, (sn I he other hand, they
have seen in flesh and blood the
actual achievements of these two
men, and no one can deny that
they have both turned out smooth,
well-coached, successful teams.
There may be coaches from other
sections of the country under con
sideration by the 8.A.C., men whom
the students do not know about,
but the fact remains that Shaw and
DeGroot stack up favorably in re
gard to ability, character, and lead
< rship with any mentors in the busi
ness. We (speaking now for the
students) perhaps "do not have at
hand sufficient information to de
tennine definitely the proper man"
as alleged under section one,
but 1 don't quite see where the 500
students who voted for Shaw and
DeGroot fell down in respect to

showing preference for men who
have everything it takes.
Maybe they don't know about
Shaughnessy, Fan rot. and others,
but it is doubtful whether any
coaches in the country have any
thing on Shaw or DeGroot in the
matter of coaching ability, or
ganizational ability, personality, i
and the other things Stanford de- i
mands in a football instructor.
:fs :J: ijt
All other things being equal, such .
as availability, desirousness for tht
position, and salary demands. I fail
to see why the wishes of the stu
dents shouldn't be observed, espe-1
cially so when it is remembered that
it is from their ranks that the foot
ball players come, and that, they are
the ones who have to sit every Sat
urday in the rooting section.
So I repeat, all things being equal,
the vote of Cuthbertson, Hiserman |
and Pool should go to either Shaw |
or DeGroot, and I defy anyone to j
say that the students are showing!
gross ignorance in favoring these i
two men.
