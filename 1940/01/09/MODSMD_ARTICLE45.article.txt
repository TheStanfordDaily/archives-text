## JERRY MAYER, Sports Editor Card Cagers Workout Today for UCLA Game Robinson Reported As 'Fastest Thing In Basketball Suit' 
### 
Stanford officially started concen
trating on their basketball game
with U.C.L.A.'s Bruins yesterday.
In their first workout since the
Wisconsin game last Wednesday and
the first on the home floor since De
cember 16, Coach Everett Dean put
his squad through a light drill and
ordered a scrimmage for this after
noon at 4:30 o'clock.
Not until possibly tomorrow af
ternoon will Dean see what his
quintet can do against Uclan plays.
Right now he has enough .in mind
in getting his players back in shape
after a five-day complete lay-off.
Train-legs and lack of work didn't
seem to hamper the club yesterday
in shooting practice. Forest Ander
son and Don Williams were hitting
the hoop with fair regularity. Fol
lowing that the team brushed up on
its fundamentals and team work.
Stanford's starting line-up doesn't
promise any changes for the Bruin
games from the one which started
all but one eastern game. Anderson
and Williams, both spectacular in
their offensive play back East, have
a good corner on the forward posts.
Dick Taylor and Bob Penn are
stand-offs at center. Ken Davidson
and Bill Cowden have the edge at
guard.
From all reports, the Bruins will
have the fastest thing in a basket
ball suit when Jackie Robinson, the
sepia football flash, gets in the game.
Johnny Colla is the ace Bruin
forward, while the veteran guard,
Alex Rafalovich, who sank the win
ning basket against St. Mary's hst
week, is back.

More than a fourth of the farms
in the United States produce an
average of less than $o()0 worth of
products annually — and 15 per
cent of this number produce less
than $400 worth of commodities.
