# Frosh Drill for Washington, Salinas; Lee Praises Linari
## 
### 
Lots of work on fast break, as J
i well as individual work for condi- j
: tion, will be the keynote of this j
I week's practice sessions for the !
Stanford Frosh cage squad as they
| prepare for the coming contests with '
I Salinas J. C. and George Washing-!
I ton Hij>h School this week-end.
: Tlie Christmas holidays played |
havoc with the players' condition, |
and Coach H. B. Lee is counting on |
j a much classier brand of basketball
[ from his team when they get back in |
i good physical shape.
Lee was fairly well satisfied with
I the playing of the team in last Sat- i
I urday's victory over San Jose High !
School, considering the fact that
I there have been lots of changes in
[ the starting line-up, and the boys |
who started the game had had little i
| or no work as a unit. He was par- j
| ticularly pleased with the work of
| Fred Linari, who had only two days' |
| work with the squad previous to
Saturday's game. It was Linari who j
was largely responsible for j
i speeding u,.. ui il.r josh's play, j
during the second the game, j
Ross Meyer and Wa'. r unabiki also j
came in for thfM ,<nare of praise

from Lee on their playing against
San Jose.
Although Ed Voss was high-point
man for the Papoose team, Coach
Lee does not believe that "Big Ed"
fully capitalized on his height, and
looks for a big improvement during
the rest of the season.
"With his height, Voss should get
almost every backboard rebound,"
said Lee.
