# Hoop to Open Winter Murals
## Basketball, Handball Will Meet Monday 
### 
Intramural basketball and hand
ball, the first two sports on Stan
ford's winter quarter intramural
program, will meet for the first day
on Monday, January 15.
Although the sign-up deadlines
for these two sports have been ex
tended to 6 o'clock today, Intra
mural Manager Andy Stojkovich
will still be able to make up leagues!
and schedules by next Monday.
There is expected to be little or no !
forfeiting of games in intramural
competition this year because of the
rule passed last week which allows
a team only one forfeiture in any
one sport and only two forfeitures I
in different sports before that team
is barred from further participation (
in intramurals.
After official compilation of fall
quarter points for the All-Intramu
ral trophy, Alpha Delt takes the lead
with 95 points, while El Toro and I
Phi Kap trail closely with 80 and
77 points, respectively.

I the Young Men's Institute came
