THIS editorial might have been written yes
terday. Had it been, it might easily have
sounded like the gripe of a college editor who
had been requested to leave the Board of Ath
letic Control meeting when it went into secret
session on Sunday.
This is not any such complaint. Yesterday s
Daily made no mention of the fact that the
editor had been excluded from the "executive
session" which attempted to pick a new foot
ball coach. However, since several San Fran
cisco newspapers prominently displayed the
information, a brief explanation may be in order.
The Daily editor and the Alumni Secretary
are invited to attend B.A.C. meetings purely
through the courtesy of the Board. (The Alumni
Secretary has not been present since he ac
cepted the position of varsity line coach.)
Whenever the B.A.C. feels that it can proceed
more speedily and efficiently with only its nine
voting members and the General Manager
present, it holds the undisputed prerogative of
asking its guests to leave. Such action cannot
be decried as anything more serious than a
breach of the laws of hospitality.
Far more important, however, are reverbera
tions of the Board's closed session that were
heard both on the campus and among Stanford
supporters and alumni up and down the Coast.
Not only members of the Stanford family, but
also interested outsiders resent the methods
employed by the Farm's nine old men.
Aside from adding fuel to the fire of student
distrust, the secret meeting antagonized friends
of the University and members of the press.
(The latter group tends to treat Stanford none
too gently anyway.)
Public relations are extremely important to
any endowed institution, and it is certain that
the manner in which the coaching situation is
being handled is neither adding to the list of
prospective donors nor helping to fill the foot
ball stadium next season.
It may be argued—and it undoubtedly will
be by the B.A.C.—that the selection of a new
coach is no more the students', the alumni's, or
the public's business than is the choosing of a
new professor of chemistry. The directors of
business corporations select the officials of
their companies at closed meetings, it may be
claimed.
All this is true. But a difference exists in the
present situation.
Six of the nine members of the Board are
elected supposedly to represent certain inter
ested groups. The members of these bodies
want to know what their representatives are
doing. They become antagonized when they
are not allowed to know what is going on, and
they feel that they are not getting a square deal.
According to the evasive answers made by
those who attended last Sunday's confab, it may
be guessed that substantial progress was made
toward the final selection of a new football
coach.
That much may be guessed. But this much is
definitely known:
Holding that secret meeting did more harm
than good for Stanford.

distrust, the secret meeting antagonized friends
of the University and members of the press.
(The latter group tends to treat Stanford none
too gently anyway.)
Public relations are extremely important to
any endowed institution, and it is certain that
the manner in which the coaching situation is
being handled is neither adding to the list of
prospective donors nor helping to fill the foot
ball stadium next season.
It may be argued—and it undoubtedly will
be by the B.A.C.—that the selection of a new
coach is no more the students', the alumni's, or
the public's business than is the choosing of a
new professor of chemistry. The directors of
business corporations select the officials of
their companies at closed meetings, it may be
claimed.
All this is true. But a difference exists in the
present situation.
Six of the nine members of the Board are
elected supposedly to represent certain inter
ested groups. The members of these bodies
want to know what their representatives are
doing. They become antagonized when they
are not allowed to know what is going on, and
they feel that they are not getting a square deal.
According to the evasive answers made by
those who attended last Sunday's confab, it may
be guessed that substantial progress was made
toward the final selection of a new football
coach.
That much may be guessed. But this much is
definitely known:
Holding that secret meeting did more harm
than good for Stanford.
THIS editorial might have been written yes
terday. Had it been, it might easily have
sounded like the gripe of a college editor who
had been requested to leave the Board of Ath
letic Control meeting when it went into secret
session on Sunday.
This is not any such complaint. Yesterday s
Daily made no mention of the fact that the
editor had been excluded from the "executive
session" which attempted to pick a new foot
ball coach. However, since several San Fran
cisco newspapers prominently displayed the
information, a brief explanation may be in order.
The Daily editor and the Alumni Secretary
are invited to attend B.A.C. meetings purely
through the courtesy of the Board. (The Alumni
Secretary has not been present since he ac
cepted the position of varsity line coach.)
Whenever the B.A.C. feels that it can proceed
more speedily and efficiently with only its nine
voting members and the General Manager
present, it holds the undisputed prerogative of
asking its guests to leave. Such action cannot
be decried as anything more serious than a
breach of the laws of hospitality.
Far more important, however, are reverbera
tions of the Board's closed session that were
heard both on the campus and among Stanford
supporters and alumni up and down the Coast.
Not only members of the Stanford family, but
also interested outsiders resent the methods
employed by the Farm's nine old men.
Aside from adding fuel to the fire of student
distrust, the secret meeting antagonized friends
of the University and members of the press.
