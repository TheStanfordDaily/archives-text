A FEW days ago it was little more than a
thought. A good thought, but no one
could possibly predict whether student en
thusiasm would boil up to a pitch high enough
to carry the thought into a real possibility.
No one could predict it, but 70 rowing en
thusiasts, over twice the expected number,
turned out last night to attend what may have
been the first meeting of the Stanford Boat Club;
for with student support so unexpectedly en
thusiastic, it appears increasingly probable that
Stanford will have a boat club, that a Cardinal
eight will man a rowing shell for the first time
since 1921.
Tonight, the plans laid last night will be sub
mitted to Ex Committee. Subject to approval of
that governing body, Stanford has a crew.
The set-up will be somewhat unique in the
field of collegiate athletics. If the plans for the
club are approved, and there seems to be no
reason that they will meet with a hitch, a crew
will be organized. But it will not be organized
as a major or minor sport. The crew will be a
production of the club, and will be self-sup
porting.

According to present plans, funds will be
provided by a membership fee in the club, and
by several interested alumni groups. The use
of a shell and a set of oars has been offered by
Ky Ebright, head crew coach at the University
of California. Arrangements have been made
for a landing at the Redwood City Harbor. A
simple shelter for the shell will be the first
cash outlay.
It is hoped by the rowing enthusiasts that a
Cardinal crew may take the water soon this
quarter. By spring they will be ready for pos
sible races against junior college and college
crews of their own class. A trip south to meet
U.C.L.A. is not an impossibility, if they pay
their own expenses.
With several graduate students on the cam
pus who have had previous rowing experience
interested in forming the boat club, with finan
cial support already assured if enough turn out
for the sport, Stanford crew looks like a real
possibility.
Among the 70 who turned out last night may
be a few who will someday match oars with
California, perhaps ride a shell at Poughkeepsie.

provided by a membership fee in the club, and
by several interested alumni groups. The use
of a shell and a set of oars has been offered by
Ky Ebright, head crew coach at the University
of California. Arrangements have been made
for a landing at the Redwood City Harbor. A
simple shelter for the shell will be the first
cash outlay.
It is hoped by the rowing enthusiasts that a
Cardinal crew may take the water soon this
quarter. By spring they will be ready for pos
sible races against junior college and college
crews of their own class. A trip south to meet
U.C.L.A. is not an impossibility, if they pay
their own expenses.
With several graduate students on the cam
pus who have had previous rowing experience
interested in forming the boat club, with finan
cial support already assured if enough turn out
for the sport, Stanford crew looks like a real
possibility.
Among the 70 who turned out last night may
be a few who will someday match oars with
California, perhaps ride a shell at Poughkeepsie.

A FEW days ago it was little more than a
thought. A good thought, but no one
could possibly predict whether student en
thusiasm would boil up to a pitch high enough
to carry the thought into a real possibility.
No one could predict it, but 70 rowing en
thusiasts, over twice the expected number,
turned out last night to attend what may have
been the first meeting of the Stanford Boat Club;
for with student support so unexpectedly en
thusiastic, it appears increasingly probable that
Stanford will have a boat club, that a Cardinal
eight will man a rowing shell for the first time
since 1921.
Tonight, the plans laid last night will be sub
mitted to Ex Committee. Subject to approval of
that governing body, Stanford has a crew.
The set-up will be somewhat unique in the
field of collegiate athletics. If the plans for the
club are approved, and there seems to be no
reason that they will meet with a hitch, a crew
will be organized. But it will not be organized
as a major or minor sport. The crew will be a
production of the club, and will be self-sup
porting.

According to present plans, funds will be
provided by a membership fee in the club, and
by several interested alumni groups. The use
of a shell and a set of oars has been offered by

of California. Arrangements have been made
