FUR COATS AND FRANTIC FROSH
/ "'ARELESS psychologists claim that thirst is the
A strongest of human motivators. The rush of ain
bitous frosh women this week, bedecked in furs and
frosty smiles, flatly contradict any such scientific be
lief. Placed in a neatly-arranged little experimental
maze, with one alley leading to a thirst-quencher and
one alley leading to prestige, represented by a sorority
pin, Stanford women would crush one-another as they
crowded the alley to social distinction.
And one can hardly blame them.
Just look what they get for a $90 initiation fee:
(1) Demurely feigning a sweet feminine sympathy,
they can feel ever so superior to their less elite class
mates who don't join a sorority. (2) They can hold out
to prospective husbands the social allure of three
Greek letters, automatically stamping themselves as
good material for blue-blooded matrons. (3) They can
engage in any number of fascinating teas and lunch
eons, at which it is not necessary to discuss anything
deeper than a cup of tea or more complicated than a
permanent wave. (4) They are freed from all necessity
of thinking for themselves; every sorority has a fine
set of standards all ready to accept.

wonder that a woman will work so earnestly
k to construct an aura of desirability around herself.
Small wonder that she will try to give the impression
af being from a fine old family whose breadwinner is
president of a huge bank. Small wonder, on the other
hand, that the sorority women will search the lining
of their rushees' fui* coats to get an estimate of their
cost. Sisters of Sigh Sigh Sig, we cannot be too care
ful about the glamour and wealth that we pledge, can
we?
The whole business of sorority rushing is on a fine
sophisticated basis. Hardly any considerations of per
sonal feeling are necessary at all. The only necessary
standard is prestige: The rushed girls try to join pres
tige; the rushing girls try to maintain prestige. It's
sort of a game, like Cops and Robbers; some of the
players are elusive; others see what they can catch.
The only difference is that cops and robbers don't have
to wear furs and silk stockings, which represent the
remarkable degree of advancement we have achieved
over the age of ten.

But one thing that is hard to take about feminine
rushing is the customary weeping session that the
pledges put on for the benefit of their unpledged class
mates. As long as we are all being sophisticated and
practical about getting prestige, sisters of Sigh Sigh,
let's do a good job of it. Let's all line up on the Row
and thumb our properly-tilted noses at the non
sorority women as we smile and say, "Nyaaa! I'm elite
and you aren't!" And then we might even slyly stick
out our tongues.
