# CAMPUS OPINION
## THREE MEN ON A HORSE 
### 
HP HE EDITOR, SIR:
In regard to the student poll for football coach
and in regard to a challenge made by the sports editor
to the effect that we should make our B.A.C. actions
strictly in accord with the results of the student poll,
we would like to say:
1. That most students surely must realize that they
do not have at hand sufficient information to deter
mine definitely the proper man to represent Stanford
as football coach.
2. That we, as student representatives, have been
studying the present situation,from all possible angles.
3. That most students have been exposed to a lo
cally limited amount of publicity and propaganda re
garding the choice of men's coach.
4. That we do realize that the poll, if enough bal
lots are cast, will help us in our decisions by showing
the general popularity of certain men, regardless of
other much-needed characteristics.
5. That we are anxious to get more student opinion
and interest in all matters considered by the B.A.C.
Yours truly,
Ken Cuthbertson
