# LET'S HE SUBTLE, GIRLS!

r JpHE EDITOR, SIR:
Something must definitely be done. The Roble
women seemingly have come to think that they arc
definitely "in." As a matter of fact, some sort of a
new high was reached the other evening when one of
them phoned a campus representative and asked.
"Could you tell me who is playing at the Mark now?"
By a very mild stretch of imagination the whole
of the little drama will readily unfold before your
eyes.
"Hello, Mary (or maybe it was Jane or Helen, that
much is immaterial), how would you like to go up to
the Mark with me next Thursday?"
"Well, gee, Bill (again the name is unimportant),
I'd just love to, but I can't tell you right now. You
see, I might have to stay with the family that night.
Could you call me back some time tomorrow?"
"Hello, is this the campus representative? Well,
could you tell me who is playing at the Mark this
Thursday? . . . Jimmy Walsh? Thank you."
Well, maybe she likes Jimmy Walsh and when the
happy boy calls he will have a date. Maybe she doesn't,
and the poor boy is out of luck. It's kind of like the
chances you take with a slot machine.
For God's sake girls, let's be subtle!
N. K.
