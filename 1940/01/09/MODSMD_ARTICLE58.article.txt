"CHRIST IN CONCRETE"—Pietro di Donato
Anions the thousands of novels which annually tell the griefs and
joys of wage earners there sometimes appears, like a Livingstone in the
wilderness, a hook which comes from the pen of a man who has not
merely glimpsed the life of the wage earner, hut was one of them.

Actually by a man who has
and who is living in dependency of
daily wages, and who accepts this
need calmly, "Christ in Concrete"
is written in so natural a vein as to
be beyond imitation by any author i
who has not himself lived the story, j
Di Donato's book deals with a '
lusty group of Italian-American men i
and women who live their lives in an
American world which they have
made their own. The center of the 1
male existence i.s The Job, hi this
case bricklaying and the countless
duties that go with construction.
This sturdy gang of workers holds
The Job not as the means to an end,
but as the end itself. The women
live for The Home, and for their
men.
READER TRANSPORTED
In the opening pages of the book
we are transported into their very
lives, not as passive observers, but
as actual participants. In every ges
ture, in every tone, the iflusion is
carried through to its conclusion. Di |
Donato's characters speak the rough,'
quaintly-accented language that his
friends do in real life, but it is
readily intelligible — the feeling of j
transition appears only when the
book is finished and the conversa
tion of everyday life resumed.
The friends whom the author
knew, and whom he gives to us in
the pages of "Christ in Concrete"
are filled with the spark of vitality,
and the pictures of their lives are
well-rounded. Their days are not all
filled with sorrow, and not all glad. |
FATHER DIES
From the point in the story where
the foreman-father dies and the eld- j
est of his family of eight takes the (
family burdens on his frail shoul- j
ders, the story speeds through the
joys and sorrows of these Italian
citizens in a style that makes each i
happening stand clear in a smooth
running plot.
It is in the conclusion that the |
author shows his complete under
standing of his people. No stereo
typed sad or happy ending, the
story closes with the family bowed
at. the death of their beloved I
mother; yet facing the future with j
assurance.—Cannon
