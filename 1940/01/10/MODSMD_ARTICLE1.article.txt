### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
JJF Prime Minister Neville Cham
berlain had his way, the "friend
ly association" between the United
States and England would be a steel -
ribbed one.
While Ex Committee was naming
Larry Livingston its Peace Day
chairman, looking forward to that
April day when Stanford will dem
onstrate, en masse, its disapproval
of armed violence, England's war
time chief was casting a net of words
to draw America into the European
fight. In a "win the war" speech
which was broadcast to the world,
Chamberlain bitterly attacked the
rulers of Germany.

"Nowhere," he said, "have they
aroused greater detestation than
throughout the continents of North
and South America. In his recent
message to the Pope, the President
of the United States declared only
by the friendly association of the
seekers of light and the seekers of
peace everywhere could the forces of
evil be overcome. I profoundly
agree, but if the forces of right are
to prevail, we must not hesitate to
risk our blood and our treasure for
so great an end."
Chamberlain didn't ask directly
th.it American "blood and treas
ure" be risked, but Tiis forceful
comment on the President's state
ment made it clcar that he'd wel
come United States intervention
on the side of the Allies. In fact,
he indicated rather definitely that
he hoped—and expected—America
to fight for the ideals which we
hold in common with Britain.

/ TIAMBERLAIN'S speech, aside
4 from its vast international impli
cations, was a warning to England.
He warned the rich they'll have to
pay higher taxes. He warned the
workers they should not expect
wage increases which would meet
the rising costs of living. He warned
the entire population more severe
rationing of food likely would be
necessary in order to reduce the
imports of non-essential commodi
ties and free more British ships for
cari-ying war supplies.
In fact. Chamberlain went on a
"warning" spree. His speech seem
ed to keynote the beginning of a
general campaign by government
leaders to offset the slow pace of
lighting at present in order to
speed up armament production
and shorten the war by intensify
ing its prosecution. And no one
can deny that England's war cam
paign shows all the signs of bog
ging down. It will need plenty of
speeding up.

J>REDICTING that the arms and
munitions industries would ab
sorb all the unemployed, Chamber
lain said the demand for labor is go
ing to be so great that there'll have
to be extensive change-overs from
one occupation to another. He re
iterated Britain's pledge for sub
stantial aid to Finland.
Then Chamberlain slipped into
the sing-song of moral virtue. He
called the current war a "crusade"
(hat the "powers of wickedness" will
fight in vain against Britain and
France, who are "defending civiliza
tion." The world got a quick picture
of bayonets and barbed wire, iron
and steel and death from grey, fog
shrouded skies —a defense of civili
zation.
Chamberlain went on, too, to
show that England is conscious of
a growing tendency to hold the
German people responsible for the
war. where hitherto only the
Nazis, and Hitler in particular, had
been blamed. This, he thought was
I rue. It was not Hitler alone, but
the entire German race that caused
the Continent's whirlpool descent
into chaos.
Echoing something that French
Premier Edouard Daladier had said
a few months ago, he seemed to think
that, a probable "United States of
Europe" might result from the war.
But Chamberlain didn't say any
thing about his junking former War
Secretary Horc-Belisha. On that
point, he remained quiet.
