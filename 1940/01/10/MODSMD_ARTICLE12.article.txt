# Knight Errant Quits Europe To Study Aviation on Farm

### BUD AMES 
Don't turn around and stare now, hut a Cavalierc of the Order of the
Crown of Italy, knighted by the hand of the King of Italy, is taking courses
at Stanford in aerodynamics and airplane design—just as a hobby. His
name is Cyril F. Elwell, '07.
"I built a 714-foot radio tower for the Italians during the World War.

It's still the highest wooden struc
' ture in the world," he explained in
a slightly English accent. "They
j were so tickled that they knighted
me."
HUNTS WALLABIES
Mr. Elwell was born in Australia
j where he used to hunt wallabies—
! little kangaroos—so he could eat the
| meat in their powerful tail. It's a
I delicacy, he stated with conviction,
j He also throws a boomerang in true

After graduating from the Farm
j he went to work for the Federal
I Telegraph Company. His pioneer
[ work in "undamped" radio waves
! led the way to wireless telegra-
I phy. "Undamped" waves, he ex

i continuous.
! BIrtLDS RADIO STATION
j "When I began to increase the dis

less telegraphy set., Dr. David Starr
j Jordan, Stanford's first president,
j went up to Sacramento and talked
I to the mayor of Stockton."
I Everybody has heard about the
Eiffel Tower, but did you know that
1 Mr. Elwell equipped the selfsame
i tower with its first continuous wave
1 radio station? That was during the
| first World War, too, when Mr. El
! well built, high-powered stations for
J the English, French, and Italian gov
ernments.
AIDS IN INVENTION
This tower in 101(5 proved the
j scene of another Elwell triumph
j when it broadcast to Arlington, U.S.,
j in the first trans-oceanic wireless
j telegraphy conversation. The oscil
| lating tubes and amplifiers necessary
i for this broadcast were discovered
jin a Palo Alto laboratory headed
| by our friend.
"Look at this scrapbook," he said
J matter-of-faetly. "I built this radio
I station in Singapore in 1936, and
this one in South Africa in 1922. And
