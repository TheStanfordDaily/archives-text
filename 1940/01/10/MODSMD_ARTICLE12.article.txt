# Knight Errant Quits Europe To Study Aviation on Farm
## 
### BUD AMES 
Don't turn around and stare now, hut a Cavalierc of the Order of the
Crown of Italy, knighted by the hand of the King of Italy, is taking courses
at Stanford in aerodynamics and airplane design—just as a hobby. His
name is Cyril F. Elwell, '07.
"I built a 714-foot radio tower for the Italians during the World War.

It's still the highest wooden struc
' ture in the world," he explained in
a slightly English accent. "They
j were so tickled that they knighted
me."
HUNTS WALLABIES
Mr. Elwell was born in Australia
j where he used to hunt wallabies—
! little kangaroos—so he could eat the
| meat in their powerful tail. It's a
I delicacy, he stated with conviction,
j He also throws a boomerang in true
j native style.
After graduating from the Farm
j he went to work for the Federal
I Telegraph Company. His pioneer
[ work in "undamped" radio waves
! led the way to wireless telegra-
I phy. "Undamped" waves, he ex
| plained, are radio waves which are
i continuous.
! BIrtLDS RADIO STATION
j "When I began to increase the dis
tance I could reach with the wire
less telegraphy set., Dr. David Starr
j Jordan, Stanford's first president,
j went up to Sacramento and talked
I to the mayor of Stockton."
I Everybody has heard about the
Eiffel Tower, but did you know that
1 Mr. Elwell equipped the selfsame
i tower with its first continuous wave
1 radio station? That was during the
| first World War, too, when Mr. El
! well built, high-powered stations for
J the English, French, and Italian gov
ernments.
AIDS IN INVENTION
This tower in 101(5 proved the
j scene of another Elwell triumph
j when it broadcast to Arlington, U.S.,
j in the first trans-oceanic wireless
j telegraphy conversation. The oscil
| lating tubes and amplifiers necessary
i for this broadcast were discovered
jin a Palo Alto laboratory headed
| by our friend.
"Look at this scrapbook," he said
J matter-of-faetly. "I built this radio
I station in Singapore in 1936, and
this one in South Africa in 1922. And
that picture on the wall shows one
I built in England—first one the
British Broadcasting System ever
had."
RETURNS TO PALO ALTO
He moved about his littered study,
for he has just returned to Palo Alto
after 26 years in Europe. He pointed
to a picture of one of his towers
with an airplane, a Sopwith pursuit,
driven halfway through it. From
two black boxes he produced radio
tubes taken from an Austrian sub-
marine sunk in the Adriatic by the
Italians. Everywhere were clip-
pings and souvenirs.
Now he has returned to the Farm
and become a member of the fac
ulty, instructing graduates in elec
trical engineering. In his spare
time he studies airplane designing—
just for fun.

"I'm fed up with Europe, especially
after 26 years there," he said. "I
figure it a good exchange that I got
out of there before this war began.
I got over there just in time to get
into the first one."
Yes, Mr. Elwell has done about
everything. He has even climbed
8,000 feet up Mount Popocatepetl in
| Mexico and planted a Stanford pen
nant there, which is worse than the
I Los Angeles Chamber of Com
merce.
