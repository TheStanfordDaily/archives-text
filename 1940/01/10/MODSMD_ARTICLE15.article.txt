# Row President Calls Initiation, Paddle Archaic
## Men's Rush Period Features Dinner, Lunch Dates Today 
### 
"For the most part, Stanford's fra
ternity system is way ahead or at
least, tip with other college campuses
all over the country, except for the
outmoded Hell Week tradition and
use of the paddle."
First-hand observation of Inter
fraternity Council President Bob
Moulton, this statement high-light
ed reports made last night to the
Council by Moulton and Secretary
Dick Hoover on the recent National
Interfraternity Conference in New
York City.
While the last rushing period of
the season is in progress yesterday
and today in the form of lunch and
dinner affairs, Hoover reported to
the Council, "A perfect record for
fair play in rushing activities has
been obtained this year, and the
houses should see to it that the
record continues until the end of the
season Friday."
SUGGEST PUBLISHING RULES
To garner favorable publicity for
Stanford chapters the officers pro
posed publication of a fraternity
handbook, listing rushing and
pledging rules, together with both
the good and bad points of the
fraternity system.
Already in use on several cam
puses, such a publication would
counteract unfavorable publicity
found in certain picture magazines,
according to Moulton. Among those
named were "Look," "Pic," and
"Life."
Following a favorable reception by
the Council, Bob Plate, Delt, and
Kay McMurray, D.U., volunteered to
undertake the activity. Moulton
stated that expenses of the proposed
handbook would be covered by the
Council treasury.
The possibility of an Interfrater
nity public relations department was
also considered at the meeting.
PLEDGE PROM CLOSED
In connection with Friday's
Pledge Prom, Chairman Dick Lusby

bers to hall men, as this is the only
closed all-fraternity dance of the
year," Lusby added.
SILENCE PERIOD STRESSED
Moulton stressed rule six of the
rushing regulations to the effect that
"no contact of any nature between
fraternity men and rushees is per
missible within the period following
preference dinners Thursday night
at 8 o'clock until after pledging
Friday. "This rule applies to tele
phone as well as personal contact,"
Moulton concluded.

nounced in Friday morning's Daily,

er, Interfraternity Council auditor.
Mr. Turner announced that all
fraternity employees, including
house managers and cooks, are no
longer subject to the Social Secur

"For the most part, Stanford's fra
ternity system is way ahead or at
least, tip with other college campuses
all over the country, except for the
outmoded Hell Week tradition and
use of the paddle."
First-hand observation of Inter
fraternity Council President Bob
Moulton, this statement high-light
ed reports made last night to the
Council by Moulton and Secretary
Dick Hoover on the recent National
Interfraternity Conference in New
York City.
While the last rushing period of
the season is in progress yesterday
and today in the form of lunch and
dinner affairs, Hoover reported to
the Council, "A perfect record for
fair play in rushing activities has
been obtained this year, and the
houses should see to it that the
record continues until the end of the
season Friday."
SUGGEST PUBLISHING RULES
To garner favorable publicity for
Stanford chapters the officers pro
posed publication of a fraternity
handbook, listing rushing and
pledging rules, together with both
the good and bad points of the
fraternity system.
Already in use on several cam
puses, such a publication would
counteract unfavorable publicity
found in certain picture magazines,
according to Moulton. Among those
named were "Look," "Pic," and
"Life."
Following a favorable reception by
the Council, Bob Plate, Delt, and
Kay McMurray, D.U., volunteered to
undertake the activity. Moulton
stated that expenses of the proposed
handbook would be covered by the
Council treasury.
The possibility of an Interfrater
nity public relations department was
also considered at the meeting.

year," Lusby added.

Moulton stressed rule six of the
rushing regulations to the effect that
"no contact of any nature between
fraternity men and rushees is per
missible within the period following
preference dinners Thursday night
