### DICK DUDMAN 
After bending their hacks to the i«l> all week, Stanford's rowing en
thusiasts missed l»y a length having (heir charter adopted last night.
Ex Committee heard that l>2 men had signed up, listened to plan.s for
acquiring shells, read the charter, and was all set to vote its approval.
But then John Partridge raised the question of liability. What if some-

should drown? Would the
A.S.S.U. or the University be liable
in ease of suit?
This objection, however, need re
sult in no more than one day's de
lay in granting the charter for the
Stanford Boat Club. Sending the
document back for alterations, Ex
| Committee agreed to consider it.
' again in a telephone poll either to
night or tomorrow.
Officers of the club, it was an
nounced last night, will be Carl
Gerlach, president; Ted Cole, vice
president; Lee Peake, treasurer;
Bob Schaeffer, secretary.
Other business of the evening fol
lows:
PEACE DAY HEAD: The com
mittee unanimously approved Pres
ident Ken Cuthbertson's selection of
Larry Livingston, Daily editor, as
Peace Day chairman.
Said Cuthbertson: "I am suggest
ing Livingston for the position in
preference to a person from some
select group that might limit the
appeal of Peace Day."
FAMILY CALL: Members of the
committee approved the following
members of the "Family Council,"
executive committee of the under

Bob Moulton (chairman), Sally
Holt, Anne Townsend, Sherman Mel
linkoff, and Art Gore.
Opined Mollie West: "If we can't
get money out of people with those
kids, we can't get it with anyone."
DELAYED AWARD: Although the
date on the recommendation read
"June 14, 1939," it was just last, night
that Ex Committee approved the
awarding of block S emblems to
Ernie Clark and Sid Hayes.

Templeton and Alfred R. Masters,
general maanger of the BAC.,
would have won the awards last,
spring in track, had it not been for
injuries.

bertson explained, was that some
body lost the paper.

Ex Committee heard that l>2 men had signed up, listened to plan.s for

But then John Partridge raised the question of liability. What if some-

should drown? Would the
A.S.S.U. or the University be liable
in ease of suit?
This objection, however, need re
