Kecent lii'iiish and I< rcneh predictions thai the United States yet may
lÂ»f com polled to enter the war on the Allied side came closer to having
official status Tuesday when British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain,
referring in a speech to President Roosevelt's peace efforts, said he agreed
with the President's statement to Congress that only "the friendly asso-

caition" of peace - seeking forces,
could banish aggression and evil.
"But if the forces of right are to
prevail, we must not hesitate to risk
our blood and our treasure for so
great an end," Chamberlain added.
He was speaking, of course, of
Britain's readiness to risk her blood
and treasure but, in the same words,
he hinted that "friendly association"
from the United States is not enough
in the war which he said is one
being fought by the Allies in defense
of democracy.
Chamberlain bitterly attacked the
rulers of Germany and warned rich
Britons that they will have to pay
higher taxes. His speech also echoed
the prediction of French Premier
Edouard Daladier that some kind of
"United States of Europe" may re
sult from the war.
FINNS ASK LOANS
As Chamberlain reiterated a
pledge for substantial British aid to
Finland, from Helsinki came ap
peals to the world for loans and
credits to carry on the war against
Russia.
Remnants of the shattered 44th
Red army division were reported in
chaotic retreat to Russian soil as
briet communiques from the Fin
nish fighting fronts reported "noth
ing of importance." Unofficial dis
patches indicated that about 6,000
Russians were killed in the smash
ing of the 44th division in Ihe same
manner and in the same region that
the Russian 163 rd division was an
nihilated Christmas week. Hundreds
more were imported killed in the
retreat across the border.
GERMANS BOMB SEA
The war at sea broke with a new
fury Tuesday. The British Admir
alty announced that three ships ap
parently had been sunk off the
North Sea coast by German planes
which bombed and machine-gunned
at least 14 vessels. One officer was
killed and 32 of a 40-man crew were
wounded when a Nazi seaplane
bombed a lightship within sight of
the Norfolk coast and then raked its
decks with machine-gun fire.
Two ships were reported sunk in
the North Sea by mines.
The 10,002-ton British liner Dun
bar Castle with 198 passengers and
crew members aboard was wrecked
by a mine off the French coast in the
Channel. The captain and two crew
members were believed to be the
only fatalities, although many sur
vivors picked up from life boats
were said to be injured.
German planes also flew over the
Firth of Tay and the Firth of Forth,
British naval bases in Scotland,
where defense planes and heavy
anti-aircraft fire drove them off.
