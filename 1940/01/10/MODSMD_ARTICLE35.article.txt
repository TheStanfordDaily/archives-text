# U.C.L.A. Opens League Cage Season Here Friday Against Favored Indians
## Bruins Seek to End Losing Streak Of Twenty-nine Conference Tilts; Jackie Robinson Is Added Threat 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Here are a couple of items which will help distinguish Stanford from
U.C.L.A. come Friday and Saturday nights when the teams meet in the
Pavilion in the Southern Division basketball openers.
The Bruins have the dubious record of 2!) straight set-backs in South
ern Division play—not a victory in over two seasons of competition.
Neither team will recognize the other's personnel when they take the i
lloor. The Bruins will start just one veteran, Alex Rafalovich, and have j

two sophomores and two junior col-<
lege transfers comprising the rest of
lhe squad. Stanford will open with
Kenny Davidson as the only vet, al
though the Bruins did get a pretty
good look' at Don Williams down
south last year.
In the event the Bruins don't re
member, Williams came through as
a mere sub last year to score 10
points in one of the games while fill
ing in for Don Burness. Since then
Williams has taken his place regu
larly on the first string and Burness
lias been declared out with an in
jured knee. Williams' scoring average
is now ru, longer in' the 10-point
category but is up around 15 points
per tilt, his average in six barn
storming games in the East.
In addition to Williams and Da
vidson, Coach Everett Dean will
have one sophomore, Bill Cowden,
a junior transfer, Fordy Anderson,
and one junior sub, Dick Taylor,
making up his team.
Besides having an unknown and
unpredictable outfit, the Bruins will
start their new coach, Wilbur Johns,
former Bruin great, out on the tough
conference road.
ROBINSON IS SPEEDSTER
The two sophs on the Bruin team
are Sandy Cameron and Bill Ward,
a pair of tall men who are the prin
cipal scoring threats. In Johns'
system the two act as offensive pivot
men at center, while Rafalovich and
the two transfer forwards, Jackie
Robinson and Johnny Colla, stay in
the backcourt. Robinson, no mat
ter where he is, however, will be a
direct offensive threat and is defi
nitely one of the fastest men ever to
take the floor in the Conference.
Bruins boast that Rafalovich is
one of the best backboard men on
the Coast, and believe that here at
last is a combination which may put
the Uclans back on the winning trail.
Lloyd Anderson, Bob Null, and Har
ley Humes, veterans of past cam
paigns—none of whom has played on
a victorious Bruin team—will offer
capable subs.
Stanford faced the Bruins and
Robinson prematurely yesterday af
ternoon in the Pavilion. With a
third string outfit imitating the U.C.-
L.A. offense even to a man repre
senting Robinson, the varsity and
second teams took turns in meeting
them in a hard and fast scrimmage.
ANDERSON HITS
Kenny Davidson or Bill Cowden—
probably the former—will have the
task of keeping Robinson in check.
Their man yesterday was Frank
Wells, the fastest Card eager.
Although they easily out-scored
the "Bruins," the varsity looked a
bit on the ragged side, showing the
effects of having gone a long time
without working together. However,
both Anderson and Williams still
peppered the hoop.
