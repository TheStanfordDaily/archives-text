# Frosh Five to Face Pair Of Crack Cage Foes Here
## 
### 
Salinas Junior College and George Washington High School, the Stan
ford Frosh's cage opponents here for this week-end. are a pair of tough
teams to beat, if their respective records to date are any indication.
The Salinas J. C. Panthers' biggest bid for basketball fame this year
came when they captured top honors in a junior college basketball tourna-

! ment which they themselves spon-,
] sored during Christmas vacation.
! They took the final game from
Menlo J. C., which is recognized as a
better than average quintet, having
defeated the Stanford B team re
serves already this season.
The sparkplug of the Salinas team
is a 6-foot, 3-inch guard by the name
of Hansen who starts all of the Pan
thers' fast-break plays by getting
backboard rebounds. He is also a
tower of strength on defense. An
other of the strong points of the
Salinas outfit is the fact that they
have an unusually large squad, all
the members of which can and do
j play lots of good ball.
Lloyd Leith's George Washington
team has also done quite well this
I season, but they will probably give
away quite a bit of height to the
Stanford cagers if Coach Lee fields
a team made up of some of his taller
boys.
The Papoose basketballers are do
ing lots of work on conditioning and
fast break this week, and Lee be-
I lieves that by the end of the week
j his team will be in shape to cop a
I couple of victories.
MONTREAL. Jan. 9 (UP).â€”With
Paul Goodman putting up a fine
j goal - keeping effoi't. the Chicago
Blackhawks blanked lies Canadiens
2-0 here tonight in a National Hock
ey League game.
