ALTHOUGH its numbers are far from im
pressive, the Stanford chapter of the Amer
ican Student Union recently has become one of
the most newsworthy organizations on the
campus simply by virtue of its members' talent
for the unexpected.
Last quarter the A.S.U. loudly protested the
University's decision that it could not have a
representative of the Communist party for a
speaker at an open meeting. (The man has
since been arraigned for deportation on the
ground that he falsified his citizenship papers
in regard to his connections with Moscow.)
Opening 1940 with a bang, the Student Un
ion's president, Andries Deinum, suddenly re
signed, and this week the members elected for
his successor an Encina freshman. Especially
surprising is this action in the light of the fact
that three juniors, long active in the A.S.U., with
impressive records in other campus activities
and better than B averages, were available.
As if this were not mysterious enough, the
new president refused to make any statement
until later this week, at which time he also prom
ised to release the action of the local chapter
on the refusal of the national convention to
brand Soviet Russia the aggressor in its conflict
with Finland.
It is amazing indeed that after making an in
contestable success of the Co-operative Book
Store, the A.S.U. was unable to find an upper
division student capable of filling its presi
dency.
Perhaps there is some truth behind the re-
L cent murmurs along the campus grapevine that
t j : heads of the Book Store are about to separate
f rn Mm the Student Union because of their dis
as|Â®e for its radical policies.
jjlFPerhaps some of the left-wing members felt
*hat a man who has spent only one quarter at
Stanford could better represent them than a
more experienced man who might (perish the
thought) attempt to make the A.S.U. an organi
zation truly representative of and interested in
the campus.
After all the Book Store heads are rumored
to be ready to break away from the American
Student Union. And they are even making
profit on their enterprise, the capitalists!
Perhaps the first pronouncement of the new
president will be an order to purge them.
