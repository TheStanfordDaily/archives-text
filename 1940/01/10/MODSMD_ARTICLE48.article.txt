# Of Rats and Women

rpHE normal college girl's diet—assuming that
L Colorado University is correct in saying that
the normal college girl's diet consists of choco
late cake, candy, pickles, and soft drinks—
is steadily killing a group of white rats in Colo
rado's laboratories.
And worse, possibly, than that, when these
rats are fed on pellets of college girls' fare, they
all turn yellow and lose their hair before they
die.
Assumption number two is that what is good
for a rat is good for a college girl. According to
these nutrition tests at Colorado, the best thing
in the world for a rat is a diet of whole wheat
and milk.
Of course it would make everything easier
if a man could take a girl to some expensive
place for dinner and have her order whole
wheat and milk, but that is just ridiculous.
And while college girls are not rats (in the
concrete), and whole wheat and milk probably
is not the best thing they could eat all the time,
the things they do eat and drink and smoke are
undoubtedly injurious as far as health is con
cerned.
College girls are bigger than rats, of course,
and different in a number of other ways, so
their diet does not make their hair fall out.
Whether it makes them yellow or not would be
difficult to say. A good half of us would not
know never having got below the make-up.

But without a doubt—and seriously —college
girls, and women in general, should follow a
lew of the tips of science and watch their vita
mins and their weight. A lot of water has
passed under the bridge since Marie Antoinette
said, "Let 'em eat cake."
Colorado suggests instituting a government
project for force - feeding recalcitrant coeds.
Stanford might suggest adopting a new slogan
to replace the old one about alcohol:
Chocolate cake, candy, pickles, and soft
drinks don't mix.—D. J.
