# Contradicting LIFE

### 
rNTERFRATERNITY COUNCIL pulled one out
1 of the hat last night, and for a change it was
neither an Administration chestnut, nor a lemon.
True, they only got it half out, but it is worth
holding onto. "It" in this case was a proposal;
a proposal to write and print a book on frater
nities. Its purpose would be to counteract the
idea of fraternities as found in "LIFE, PIC, and
LOOK."
At the same time, the Council considered es
tablishing a public relations council.
The worth of these things is obvious. Aside
from the harmful publicity Stanford and other
universities receive every year from magazine
and newspaper articles, there is one much more
important reason for printing such a book:
Incoming freshmen get a completely cock
eyed conception of what a fraternity is like, and
the result when the time comes for them to
consider whether they will "go Row" is usually
confusion, and sometimes rather pitiful.
This condition is more typical of other schools
than of Stanford, but it does exist here. And if
this book can explain clearly that social dis
tinction between Hall and Row just doesn't
exist, and if it makes plain that there is not as
much holding of secret meetings as holding of
beer glasses and bull sessions, the freshmen
will be that much better off.
And if at the same time they can explain
precisely why the hell it is, as well as what the
hell it is, their book will be invaluable.â€”D. J.
