MILLIONS FOR TRIBUTE
YEAR when army-navy appropriations
loom on the congressional horizon military ex
perts find unthinkable gaps in our national defense.
Every year they tell us that a few hundred million dol
lars will make our fortifications well-nigh impreg
nable. But every year they find astonishing new
weaknesses that imperil our very homes. And the
"weaknesses" end up by imperiling the country with
jingoistic propaganda, to the tune of an astronomical
numbered fortune.
This year, to start 1940 off in the right tradition,
the navy is asking Congress for well over a billion
dollars "to strengthen our sea force," and for half a
million dollars to fortify Alaska. This last move, the
experts claim, will be doubly advantageous: it will
be a good defense position, and it will be a good base
for a "counter attack." Furthermore, our cheery ad
mirals have even ventured guesses that with England
all tied up in the war we may become the greatest
naval power in the world.
Since these same military experts have often ex
pressed their devout desire for peace, they must be
thinking of some imposing foe that is about to attack
our tranquil shores. Being the greatest naval power
in the world has no particular advantage in itself. If
we don't intend to use our sea strength we might just
as well build silver-plated jack-straws. They would
be just as useful and a lot more wholesome to play
with.

WO IT must be that our naval and military experts,
k who after all are very intelligent men, envisage
some savage invasion. Undoubtedly they are thinking
of Japan. Now it is true that Japan is spending more
than she can afford to enmesh herself in China, and
it is true that Japanese battleships don't have a cruis
ing range long enough to reach San Francisco with
out refueling, and it is true that our navy is already
40 per cent larger than Japan's. But there is still
the danger that the Japanese army will drop down
from the skies on us with parachutes or l'ockets. We've
got to watch out f6r them.
Of course Germany has a few little worries of her
own, but she will probably start bombing New York
as soon as her fleet polishes off the British. And we
always have to think about our vicious neighbors,
Mexico and Canada. They might close in on us with
a pincer maneuver. And just lately, with the mobili
zation of Finland, new threats to our security have be
come imminent. As soon as the Finns beat Russia they
are very likely to ski right over the Bering Strait
and converge on Yosemite.
Yes sir, it's certainly a good thing we arc spend
ing another thousand million dollars "for defense."
i There's not much else you could do with the money
now-a-days anyhow.
