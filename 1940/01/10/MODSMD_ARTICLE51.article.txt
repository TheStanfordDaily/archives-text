# CAMPUS OPINION
## A 						SATIRIST AT LARGE 
### 
r rilE EDITOR, SIR:
The Campus Opinion letter which recently hit
the Farm between the eyes contained, in my opinion,
one of ihe most sound and sensible suggestions ever
to appear in that department. Yes, indeed, our old
friend, Dave "Don't Be Ashamed to Sign It, Brother"
LefT has come through with an inspired idea.
By way of agreement with LefT: How annoying it
is to wade through a rather lengthy and impressive
Campus Opinion letter, only to find that you are left
dangling in mid-air by the meaningless nom-de-plume
which is attached. Why, half the enjoyment of read
ing an article comes from knowing who wrote it. For
example, wouldn't some of Robert Benchley's stuff
seem silly if we thought that it was turned out by
Santayana. On second thought, that's not such a good
example. I retract it.
What I am trying to say is that you may want to
find the writer of one of these letters and either con
gratulate or kill him, according to your respective
points of view. Now, if he doesn't sign the thing, you
won't be able to do that, will you. Of course not.
So here's for no more anonymity in Campus Opin
ion. We want letters and we want names.
Sincerely,
Oil famous
