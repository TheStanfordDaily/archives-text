# 'Dust Be My Destiny' Is Good Evening's Escape
## 
### 
"DUST BE MY DESTINY," now playing at Fox Varsity theater.
This picture is another one of those sociological yarns, but that needn't
i scare you out if all you want is an evening's escape.
Best avenue of escape is. I found, Priscilla Lane, whose uncombed
| blond hair looks swell when it's messy.

And then there's shifty-eyed John,
Garfield, who seems utterly compe
tent as he tricks the jailer to get out
of jail, hoists himself into a moving
box-car, or rides the running board
of the crime car, grappling with the
driver.
GARFIELD IS LUCKY
This Garfield has a lot of luck.
Happening to be on the spot when
the bandits shoot up the bank, he
grabs back his camera from the
hock-shop man, hides behind an
ashcan, and shoots a string of pic
tures that catch the bandits, get him
a job on a paper, and convert him
to respectability.
So you can see there's plenty in
"Dust. Be My Destiny" to keep it
| from being much like an Econ. 75
lecture.
The sociological side is well done,
however. He portrays the transient,
pursued for a crime he did not com
mit. He knows that he will be
judged for what he is—a homeless
tramp who escaped from a prison
camp—instead of for what he has
done. That keeps him on the run,
afraid to go back to face a trial.
ENDING SATISFIES
This trial happened to be the ex
ceptional one. The jury, seeing that
he really was a good boy, acquitted
1 him, and it turned out that dust
really wasn't his destiny. In spite of
the suddenness of the happy end
ing—and its improbability—it is sort
of satisfying to have things turn out
right .
On the same bill is "Hawaiian
I Nights," apparently about Hawaii,
featuring some persons named
Johnny Downs, Mary Carlisle, and
Eddie Quillan. A help to the pro
ceedings is Matty Malneck's orches
tra, whom you've heard on the radio
as "The Sophisticates."—Dudman
