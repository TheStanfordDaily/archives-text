# History ... 1940

### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
V'O PRESIDENT ever wants to im
pose new taxes on the eve of a
national elections. That's why
Roosevelt kept his 1941 budget low;
and that's why the Senate voted
unanimously yesterday to set up a
super committee to see whether the
Administration's estimates of $8,-
424,000,000 can be still further re
duced.
The president has warned his
legislators, at least the Democratic
steering committee in the House,
that they'd better stay within his
budgetary recommendations. He's
afraid that the national debt may
climb above the statutory $45,000,-
000,000 limitation.
The debt already is about $3.-
000,000,000 short of the ceiling.
And if Congress reacts like a pack
of good little troupers and votes
the $4(Â»0,000,000 in national defense
taxes that the President has hinted
at, the debt will he about $61,000,-
000 below the limit at the close of
the fiscal year beginning July 1.
At the same time there were minor
flare-ups in Congress. There's al
most sure to be a good floor battle
over Roosevelt's proposal to double
the merchant marine subsidy at a
time when operations of other fed
eral agencies are being curtailed.
Senatorial action yesterday co
incided with an unusual economy
move in the House. By a reported
vote of 14 to 11, the House appro
priations committee adopted a reso
lution morally binding its various
subcommittees not to exceed the
President's budget figures. This
resolution would make absolutely
impossible the recommendations for
an unbudgeted $250,000,000 for farm
parity payments such as was voted
in 1939.

y ETTING back to this "super-com
mittee," though, Congress de
cided that it would be made up of
24 members, drawn from the appro
priations and tax-making commit
tees of the two houses. The plan may
not be as significant as it now ap
pears on the surface; probably House
leaders will sidetrack the proposal
mid continue with their original
plan of jamming one appropriation
bill through the House each week
for 11 weeks.
Senator Adams of Colorado sum
marized the situation in Washing
ton pretty neatly when he told his
colleagues that the President again
has "outsmarted" them in his
budgetary recommendations. Fur
thermore, he said, "he did it with
a twinkle in his eye."

r wasn't news to the Senate.
Most of them knew it. They
knew that Mr. President had given
them the choice of accepting the cuts
he made, voting defense taxes and
slaying within the debt limit, or re
storing the cuts, denying additional
taxes and raising the debt ceiling.
Either decision, you can bet, packs
political dynamite.
If the presidential reductions
are approved, there will be yelps
from constituents who lose their
jobs. And, like the President, these
lawmakers shudder at the thought
of increasing taxes in election
year. Yet most of them don't want
to oppose national defense meas
ures at (he risk of being called
unpatriotic and they're plenty ap
prehensive of back-home reaction
to raising the debt ceiling to per
mit still more spending. They
realize that a good part of the na
tion is tired of that.

Senator Carter Glass pondered
the situation. Then, from the vast
store of his practical background of
politics, he posed this question:
' What makes you think this new
committee (the Senate's "super
committee" will recommend econ
omies? It might be composed of
members who never voted to reduce
a single appropriation and would
give away the capital if anyone
asked for it."
