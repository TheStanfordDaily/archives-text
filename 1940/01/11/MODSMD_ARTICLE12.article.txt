## More Plays Needed In Rams Head Contest 
### 
Renewing the call for scripts in the
Ram's Head one-act play contest,
Dan Holtom, one-act play director,
announced again yesterday that,
scripts may be turned in to Chester
Barker in Memorial Theater.
Deadline for submitting manu
scripts has been set for January 31,
and the winning three plays will be
presented on March 8 and 9. Scripts
from students enrolled in play writ
ing classes will be welcomed, but
any student may enter the contest.
Previous playwriting experience is
not necessary.
The winning plays will receive
presentation, and their authors will
automatically become members of
Ram's Head and their names will be
engraved on a plaque.
Inaugurated last year, the one
act play contest has become an an
nual event. Last year's winners were
ex-Daily Editor Jim Stone's "Be
ginning Without End," June Lee
Dimmitt's "Angry Mountain," and
Art Levinson's "Thirty Years."
The one-act play contest is an
attempt to develop the more con
ventional student-written drama on
campus. It also refutes the charge
occasionally made that Ram's Head
is a "closed shop," since the contest
is open to anyone, he said.
