# Rains Come; Make Lagunita Frogs Happy
## 
### BUD AMES 
And the Rains came.
From the source from which all
blessings How, the Palo Alto City
Hall, comes word that 5.67 inches
have fallen since January 1, all of
which goes to make the frogs in
Lake Lagunita very happy. Yester
day it dribbled .38 inches worth and
the day before .47 worth.
"The rain don't affect us," a fire
hou.se man mumbled with a glance
out the window. "In a way it cuts
fire hazards, but people use their
fire places more, which just about
balances things. Only thing that
worries us is having to take the
trucks nut in the mud and then
having to clean them."
ANGLEWORMS TURN OUT
And look what the rain has
brought out—the angleworms and a
voguish nightmare of practical water
shedders. Women have followed
muddy masculine footsteps and
have adopted the oily Sou'wester'
caps turned the wrong way.
Running a close second are crew
hats—green, brown, blue, and a re
pulsive but patriotic cardinal. The
latest touch are the calf-high rub
ber boots which keep out the water
and do nice things to their legs.
MEN WEAR PORK-PIES
The men have turned to pork-pies
but many have resurrected moth
bally reminders of better days—and
distant days they must have been.
Down Lake Lagunita way, the
cofTee-with-crcam colored water is
rapidly filling the bed. A1 last rend
ing it was touching just under the
2!)-foot mark, which brings the
water right up to the base of the
canoe ramps.
Over in the shadow of the Hoover
War Library, Foreman John Leavers
grunted at the rain.
"We're human; we can't work out
in that rain," he grumbled. "It's
plenty slippery up on those wet
girders. The water reaiiy helps the
cement set, but fellows can't take
their tools out in that stuff."
The librarian wasn't happy, either.
"Seems like everybody has been
studying in their rooms since the
rain began," he explained. "Why,
last quarter this reading room was
packed consistently, but it hasn't
been completely filled all this
quarter yet."
And the Toyon operator 3121 had
something to say.
"Heavens, I don't know whether
it's rushing or raining, but I've been
going all afternoon," he said. "This
is the busiest afternoon I've ever
seen."
And the Rains came.

water right up to the base of the
canoe ramps.
Over in the shadow of the Hoover
War Library, Foreman John Leavers
grunted at the rain.
"We're human; we can't work out
in that rain," he grumbled. "It's
plenty slippery up on those wet
girders. The water reaiiy helps the
cement set, but fellows can't take
their tools out in that stuff."
The librarian wasn't happy, either.
"Seems like everybody has been
studying in their rooms since the
rain began," he explained. "Why,
last quarter this reading room was
packed consistently, but it hasn't
been completely filled all this
quarter yet."
And the Toyon operator 3121 had
something to say.
"Heavens, I don't know whether
it's rushing or raining, but I've been
going all afternoon," he said. "This
is the busiest afternoon I've ever
seen."
And the Rains came.
From the source from which all
blessings How, the Palo Alto City
Hall, comes word that 5.67 inches
have fallen since January 1, all of
which goes to make the frogs in
Lake Lagunita very happy. Yester
day it dribbled .38 inches worth and
the day before .47 worth.
"The rain don't affect us," a fire
hou.se man mumbled with a glance
out the window. "In a way it cuts
fire hazards, but people use their
fire places more, which just about
balances things. Only thing that
worries us is having to take the
trucks nut in the mud and then
having to clean them."
ANGLEWORMS TURN OUT
And look what the rain has
brought out—the angleworms and a
voguish nightmare of practical water
shedders. Women have followed
muddy masculine footsteps and
have adopted the oily Sou'wester'
caps turned the wrong way.
Running a close second are crew
hats—green, brown, blue, and a re
pulsive but patriotic cardinal. The
latest touch are the calf-high rub
ber boots which keep out the water
and do nice things to their legs.
MEN WEAR PORK-PIES
The men have turned to pork-pies
but many have resurrected moth
bally reminders of better days—and
distant days they must have been.
Down Lake Lagunita way, the
cofTee-with-crcam colored water is
rapidly filling the bed. A1 last rend
ing it was touching just under the
2!)-foot mark, which brings the
water right up to the base of the
canoe ramps.
