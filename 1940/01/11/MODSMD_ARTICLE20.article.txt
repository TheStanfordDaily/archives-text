## Storm Closes Roads; Big Breakers Smash Beach Properties 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 20 (UP).
â€”Threats of flood increased in
California Wednesday as the state
took its 11th consecutive day of
rainstorms and new storms moved
in from the Pacific.
The rising San Joaquin River
endangered the preliminary con
struction work on Fraint Dam,
southern key of the vast Central
Valleys water project, near Fresno.
Engineers were preparing to defend
the site if the water comes any
higher.
The stormy Pacific Ocean smashed
beach homes in Southern California
and as far north as Santa Cruz.
HIGHWAYS BLOCKED
Highways were blocked by water
and slides. The State High 49 near
Coulterville in Mariposa County
was flooded. Slides closed No. 1
between Big Sur and San Luis Obis
po county line. No. 20 between
Ukiah and upper lake was under
three feet of water, forcing a four
mile detour. The Sacramento-
Woodland highway and Highway 90
in Yolo County were closed tempo
rarily.
The 11-day deluge, following an
autumn drouth, brought seasonal
rainfall totals far above those of last
year. Farmer's were jubilant as irri
gation dams and water supply reser
voirs filled and the mountain snow
packs assured water for next sum
mer.
BREAKERS TAKE TOLL
The Sacramento and American
rivers were high but were expected
to reach crests just below flood
stage.
Beach communities took the bat
tering of breakers that came as high
as 30 feet. Santa Cruz and Capitola
Beach front properties were badly
damaged, the Capitola casino being
nearly wrecked. The pier at Man
hattan Beach was split.
At Long Beach, discarded Christ
mas trees were jammed into the
sand to keep the beach from wash
ing away. Thirty beach homes were
flooded at Santa Barbara and off
shore oil wells were damaged.
A cloudburst near Folsom washed
out Southern Pacific freight tracks.
Northwestern Pacific's line through
the Redwood Empire was blocked by I
slides and passengers were carried !
by bus.
