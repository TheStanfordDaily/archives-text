### 
BARTLEY, W.Va., Jan. 11 (UP).—
(Thursday)—ln a race with death,
rescue crews worked valiantly 600
feet under ground early today in
the Bartley No. 1 mine of the Pond
Creek Pocahontas Coal Corp. to
reach 95 miners trapped by an ex
plosion.
With seven bodies recovered,
there was diminishing hope that, all
the entombed miners, whose num
ber was revised to 95 early this
morning, could be rescued alive.
As 2000 relatives and friends of thr
miners huddled anxiously around
bonfires, 25 to 30 rescue crews of
six men each awaited their turn to
go down into the mine in an effort
to reach the miners trapped two and
a half miles from the main shaft.
About 1500 to 1800 feet, from the
shaft entrance was unaffected by
the explosion, which ripped through
three sections of the diggings about
two and a half miles from the en
trance at 2:20 p.m. yesterday.
