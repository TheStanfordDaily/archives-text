>ter official. Iho charter was amended
by addition of a clause releasing tJic

accident to any participant in the
sport.

The amendment reads, "The Uni
versity, the A.S.S.U., and the Bont

inaugurated into the sports program
is to build a shelter for the shell
and a rowing barge on which to
train prospective crewmen.

cial support is adequate," Bob
SchacfTer, secretary, said last night.
"We have sent letters to several
alumni, and though we have already
received some replies we have not
received enough to go ahead.

to have a crew practicing by the
second week in February. But it all
depends upon how soon we can build
the boathouse and the barge."

The amended charter of the Stanford Boat Club was adopted unani
mously by eight members of Ex Committee voting in a telephone poll yes
terday aftrnonn, removing the last official obstacle to the plan which will
put a Stanford rowing crew on the water "sometime winter quarter."
Three members of Ex Committee could not be reached for the voting
yesterday, but the eight aflirmative votes were enough to make the char-

>ter official. Iho charter was amended
by addition of a clause releasing tJic
University, the A.S.S.U., and tho
Boat Club from liability in ea.sc of
accident to any participant in the
sport.
AMENDMENT MADE
The amendment reads, "The Uni
versity, the A.S.S.U., and the Bont
Club will not be responsible in any
way for those persons engaged in
rowing activities."
With Ex Committee approval, it
was revealed that the next step that
must be taken before crew can lx
inaugurated into the sports program
is to build a shelter for the shell
and a rowing barge on which to
train prospective crewmen.
"We can do this as soon as finan
cial support is adequate," Bob
SchacfTer, secretary, said last night.
"We have sent letters to several
alumni, and though we have already
received some replies we have not
received enough to go ahead.
PRACTICE BV FEBRUARY
"At any rate," he added, "we hopr
to have a crew practicing by the
second week in February. But it all
depends upon how soon we can build
the boathouse and the barge."
Tlie next meeting of the club is
tentatively scheduled for next Wed
nesday, at which time Schaeffer said
it was hoped even more students
would turn out. Seventy attended
the first meeting of the club early
this week.
MEMBERSHIP FEE
A vote on a possible membership
fee, to help finance the sport, will
be taken at the next meeting.

tained; Ky Ebright, head crew coach
