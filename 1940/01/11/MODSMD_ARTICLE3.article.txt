# British Bomb German Dam, Island Bases
## Finns Isolate Soviet Force, Claim 50,000 Red Troops Smashed 
### United Press 
Angered by German machine
gunning and bombing attacks on
merchant ships, Great Britain's
Royal Air Force turned its fury on
Germany's Helgoland Bay bases
Wednesday in an attempt to blast
with bombs the aerial menace to
shipping along Britain's North Sea
shores.
Various reports poured out of
Denmark that the British had suc
cessfully bombed Hindenburg Dam,
a narrow breakwater and roadway
between German Jutland and the
island of Sylt, but there was no
claim of this coming from the British
and the Germans likewise were si
lent.
One British plane was lost in bat
tling German planes during the
attack, the Air Ministry said in con
tradiction of a German announce
ment that three of nine British
bombers had been shot down over
Helgoland Bay. The Air Ministry
said one German Messerschmitt
fighter was seen to crash at sea and
that another made a forced landing
in Denmark while all but one of
the British planes returned safely.
FINNS STILL LEAD
In the Finnish-Russian conflict,
a Soviet force on the Sal la front
was said to be isolated from its base
and to face the threat of annihilation
or capture in the same manner that
the Red Army's 163 rd and 44th divi
sions were trapped and smashed
southward around Suomusalmi.
From the Finnish Northeastern
army near the Russian frontier came
reports that the Finns, in three major
battles on the Suomusalmi front
during the past 17 days, had almost
destroyed a Soviet army corps of
about 50,000 men and had crossed the
Russian frontier in pursuit of rem
nants of smashed divisions of the
Red army.
Evidently doping to bolster its air
force, which thus far has proved
ineffective in Finland, Russia ap
pointed A. I. Shakhurin as people's
commissar for the aviation industry,
succeeding Mikhail M. Kaganovitch
who was transferred to "another
post." It was believed Russia was
getting ready to launch a new air
plane construction program.
POPE ENTERS CONFLICT
In Vatican City Pope Pius XII was
reported to have sent assurances to
the Scandinavian states that he is
considering a plan in conjunction
with President Roosevelt to prevent
the spread of Bolshevism to the Nor
dic states.
In the United States the Recon
struction Finance Corporation and
the Export-Import Bank prepared to
establish credits up to $10,000,000
for Norway for purchase of agricul
tural and manufactured products.
Significant in tKs connection is the
fact that the two organizations re
cently provided up to $15,000,000
credit for similar purposes for Fin
land.
