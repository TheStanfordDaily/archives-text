# Chapin Recalls Air-Raid Perils
## 
### 
Air raids on the population cen- ,
ters of Europe such as are being
employed in World War II are re
sulting in the slow disintegration of
the culture of the warring nations,
according to Dr. Leland T. Chapin,
who spoke on "Thoughts During an
Air Raid" before the Luncheon Club
in the Nitery yesterday noon.
"Every man, woman, and child is
in this war," said Dr. Chapin. The
people are being roughened and
coarsened by miserable living con
ditions forced on them through pre
cautions against air raids, he added.
Dr. Chapin was visiting in Edin
burgh during the first two months
of war and went through three air
raids during this time.
Air raids on helpless people are
what "make you realize that war is
far worse than it used to be," said
Dr. Chapin.
