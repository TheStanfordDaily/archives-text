# Smith, Colyear Head Mermen
## Freshmen Favorites To Win Interclass 
### 
You can look to the frosh to be
right in the swim come January 20
for the interclass aqua meet in En
cina pool.
Coach Norton Thornton has pulled
up his beaten brow from under the
burden of hard luck early this year
when he lost Scott Dudley and
Gardner Miller of the varsity squad.
He is encouraged no end over the
possibilities of the Cardinal fresh
man paddlers.
Leading the 23 out for the team,
the largest number of aspirants in
the history of the school, are Don
Smith and Baylor Colvear.
SHADES OF HERRON?
Both offer shades of Paul Herron,
missing national frosh champion at
any event last year, because of their
versatility. But neither are quite up
to the great Paul's accomplishments.
First there is a local sensation, Don
Smith, from Palo Alto Iligh School,
a rating prep institution in swimming
circles.
Smith is already the school's num
ber one man in the 100 and 200. But
he can swim any event, including
the breaststroke and backstroke. As
a matter of practice, however, he
will be kept at the freestyle middle
distance matches.
STATE CIIAMP
The other ace, Collyear, is state
prep champion and record-holder in
the backstroke. His high school time
lor the 100 was 1:03.8, and as soon
as he gets used to the added 50 yards
lor intercollegiate races, co-Captain
of the varsity Bill VVeeden had bet
ter watch out. A great duel looms
between the pair in the interclass
meet.
Besides Colyear in the backstroke,
the frosh's strongest event, are Bob
Williams from Tamalpais and Ed
Sandman from Stockton.
Behind Smith in the freestyle
events arc several men of not sen
sational but outstanding ability. In
c'uded are Malcolm MacKillop, Phil
Philick, Don Dillon, a sprint on the
frosh water polo team, A1 Busch,
Bob Morris and Ralph Kiewit.
