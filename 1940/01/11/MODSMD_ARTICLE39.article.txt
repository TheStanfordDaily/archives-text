ABOUT THINGS AND STUFF
NEW FOOTBALL COACH—Ru
mor has it (as you have undoubtedly
read already) that Clark Shaugh
nessy, Chicago's high-and-dry grid
coach, is to be Stanford's new foot
ball mentor. Announcement of his
selection and acceptance is expected
to be forthcoming after tomorrow
night's Board of Athletic Control
meeting.
It is also rumored that Shaugh
nessy is a compromise choice in
the face of large, well organized, and
unyielding "pressure groups" back
ing Buck Shaw and Dud DeGroot.
These statements are all products of
hearsay, and are passed on as such,
although they sound reasonable. Es
pecially so when one remembers the
friendly conversation held t'other
day between Shaughnessy and Dr.
Wilbur.
LUISETTI'S SUCCESSOR—Read
somewhere or other: "Ray Bals
ley, California basketball captain
in 19157, watched Lou Smith (the
football player) play one game
with an Oakland Shell Oil team
last year and tabbed him 'tops in
natural ability'—lacking only ex
perience to compare him with
Hank Luisetti."
Next thing you know Cal will he
comparing their intramural touch
football stars with Ernie Nevers.
CONFERENCE FREEZEOUT —
Critics of the Coast Conference often
get quite bitter over the fact that the
round-robin cuts the independents
right out of the schedules of the
various conference schools. But
Stanford, in announcing its 1940 grid
schedule yesterday, displayed dates
with two of the leading independent
teams the critics have been hollering
for. Stanford thus becomes the first
Conference university to schedule
two of the Bay Region's strong trio
of Catholic independents in one sea
son since the round-robin came into
effect.
