# Cards Face Vowing Five From UCLA
## Bruin Quintet After First PCC Victory hi Two Lean Years 
### 
U.C.L.A.'s basketball team, with a |
brand new coach at the reins and j
four untested cagers on the starting
team, heads north this evening to j
start the Southern Division race j
with our Indians tomorrow and Sat
urday nights.
The Bruins, an unknown outfit,
will have the benefit of one of the
noblest of all vows to back them up
in the week-end double-header.
The vow—to win their first South- j
em Division game in 30 starts (a ;
long time in any league)—may not i
possibly be wasted, Coach Everett i
Dean of the Indians fears.
ONE VETERAN
Only Alex Rafalovich remains i
from last year's quintet, although |
Harley Humes, Lloyd Anderson, and j
Bob Null are playing on the second
string. The "new" Bruins have two
members of that Ucla frosh team
which stuck with the Trobabes in j
three games last year. Those men i
are the two scoring threats, Sandy !
Cameron and Bill Ward.
Johnny Colla and Jackie Robin- i
son, transfers from Sacramento and '
Pasadena Jaysees, make up the rest
of the team. Among the four of j
them, along with the veteran steadi- j
ness of Rafalovich, the quintet j
showed that they may be just the >
club to end an all-time high in the j
number of straight defeats —29
games.
WELLS FOR ROBINSON
Since Coach Dean figures on a |
scrapping Southern outfit, he had
some of his scrappiest third string
ers aping the Bruins the past two
practice sessions, using Bruin plays ]
as well as using Bruin names.
Frank Wells was Robinson and i
had the dependable Kenny David
son guarding him. The rest of the
Uclans were Kai Larsen. Ed DeMoss,
Bob Wensel, and Ralph Meigs. This
team kept the varsity on its toes, but
their "Bruin" offense was never able
to penetrate the Indian defense con- 1
sistently making only scattered
points.
LA FAILLE IMPROVES
All the first string points were di
vided among Fordy Anderson, Don
Williams, and Davidson. The team's
offense showed considerable im
provement over their Tuesday per
formance. but the squad still showed
the effects of their long layoff after
returning from the Eastern invasion.
A second team of Leon Lafaille—
the most improved man on the
squad, Gil Rahn, John Alltucker,
Tiff Denton, and Bob Penn took its
turn against the Bruin offense and
defense later in the workout.
The club scrimmages again this
afternoon and takes it easy to
morrow.
