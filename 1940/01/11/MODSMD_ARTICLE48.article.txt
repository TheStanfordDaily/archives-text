# Ring Veterans Return to Spar In School Meet
## Gridman Gallarneau Hack to Bid for Title Left Vacant by Ward 
### 
Coach Clayton Frye's boxers, both j
veterans and neophytes, are sweat- i
ing themselves into shape for the j
annual All-University tournament !
to be held Thursday night, January j
18. in Encina Pavilion.
This tournament, whose competi- j
tore furnish most of the material for :
the varsity boxing team, is featured !
this year by the return to the j
squared circle of Hugh Gallarneau, i
varsity gridder. Two years ago Gal- j
larneau was the class of the coast j
in the light-heavyweight division, I
and cleaned up in his heavyweight j
match against Cal.
PERSUADED TO RETURN
Last year he gave up boxing j
"forever," but he has been per- !
suaded to return and he will con- |
tinue to show Stanfordites some of
the classiest leather-pushing of any,
boxer in Stanford history, according j
to Coach Frye.
Gallarneau's superiority in the j
heavyweight division will probably I
be contested by Yank Levin, Ed Mc- !
Cain, frosh footballer, and Don
Grant, novice winner. At 175 pounds, i
hard-hitting novice winner Jack El-j
liott will be opposed by Dan |
O'Brien.
PLENTY OF VETS
Lettermen Doug Grant and Ed
Stein, and Ken Rosengren are in
the scrap at 165 pounds, while let
terman Tom Mac Michael, Jim Thur
mond, and possibly novice winner '
Jimmy MeCloud will battle for 155-
pound honors.
In the other weight divisions, let
termen Jack Rice, Johnny Wilson,
Bob Hovey, and Bruce Berg will
match haymakers with newcomers i
Frank Hewitt, Larry Winter, Ted
Doe, and several others.
Elimination bouts will start not
later than next Monday, and the en
try list will not be closed until that
time. Prospective contestants are
urged by Coach Frye to sign up im
j mediately, however.
