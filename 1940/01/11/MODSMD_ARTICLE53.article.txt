# They Know Not What They Do

DESPITE the firm opposition of the presidents
of all of the campus' 24 fraternities, Inter
fraternity Council President Bob Moulton is still
carrying on his fight for the reformation of Hell
Week and the abolition of the paddle.
Reporting on the recent National Interfrater
nity Conference before a meeting of the Coun
cil this week, he stressed the fact that Stanford s
Row outshines those of other colleges in every
respect but that of initiation practices.
He also announced that the convention had
passed a resolution condemning Hell Week
methods and urging the substitution of intelli
gent programs for physical hazing.
Because he is working for such a reformation
at Stanford and because he complied with a
University request to enforce some of Inter
fraternity Council's own rules which were
broken last quarter, certain fraternity men have
condemned Moulton as a tool of the Adminis
tration.
Anyone who has sense enough to view Stan J
ford's fraternity initiations in the unescapable
light of their puerile stupidity will know that
the Council president is fighting for what he
knows is right, not for what the University
wants him to.
The abolition of Hell Week already has come
to most colleges in the country. Only a few
schools on the Pacific Coast and in the East
maintain this archaic custom.
Inevitably it will be wiped out at Stanford,
despite the protests of petty minds and per
petual sophomores.
Meanwhile, like others before him, the presi
dent of Interfraternity Council is a prophet with
out honor in his own country.
