# A 						Move for Good Will
## 
### 
THE first public appearance of the 1940 Stan
ford football team under its as yet unknown
coach will not take place on the greensward of
the local stadium. Instead, the boys in red will
open their season with a contest against U.S.F.
in San Francisco's foggy Kezar Stadium.
Although four previous contests with the
Dons were held in the City through 1935, never
before has an opener been played away from
Stanford. Since this year's first game will be
in the nature of a debut for the new coach,
perhaps an explanation of this deviation from
hallowed precedent is in order.
As has been mentioned in these columns
before, public relations are extremely impor
tant to any endowed institution, especially to
a large university. One of the few contacts
that the outside world has with Stanford is
watching its football games.
The attendance at Stanford games has been
steadily dropping during the past few years.
Obviously the fact that the team has not been
winning them has a great deal to do with this.
The bleacher coaches demand victories in re
turn for their support.
However, another factor enters into the situ
ation. Since the Bay Bridge has been com
pleted, more and more San Francisco football
fans have discovered that it takes only 20 min
utes to drive over the bridge to Berkeley, while
it takes one hour to get down to Stanford. Only
a loyal friend and supporter will bother to do
the extra 40 minutes' driving.
It is in an effort to win such friends and sup
porters, to improve public relations in San
Francisco and the Bay Area, that Stanford is
playing the U.S.F. game at Kezar.
Naturally the fact that it will be the first game
under the new coach will make it an auspicious
occasion. It is surprising how much a move of
this kind can do to improve relations between
Stanford and the good citizens of the City.
We trust that nobody will mention the fact
that Stanford scheduled U.S.F. for the opener
because no other date was available.

perhaps an explanation of this deviation from
hallowed precedent is in order.
As has been mentioned in these columns
before, public relations are extremely impor
tant to any endowed institution, especially to
a large university. One of the few contacts
that the outside world has with Stanford is
watching its football games.
The attendance at Stanford games has been
steadily dropping during the past few years.
Obviously the fact that the team has not been
winning them has a great deal to do with this.
The bleacher coaches demand victories in re
turn for their support.
However, another factor enters into the situ
ation. Since the Bay Bridge has been com
pleted, more and more San Francisco football
fans have discovered that it takes only 20 min
utes to drive over the bridge to Berkeley, while
it takes one hour to get down to Stanford. Only
a loyal friend and supporter will bother to do
the extra 40 minutes' driving.
It is in an effort to win such friends and sup
porters, to improve public relations in San
Francisco and the Bay Area, that Stanford is
playing the U.S.F. game at Kezar.
Naturally the fact that it will be the first game
under the new coach will make it an auspicious
occasion. It is surprising how much a move of
this kind can do to improve relations between
Stanford and the good citizens of the City.
We trust that nobody will mention the fact
that Stanford scheduled U.S.F. for the opener
because no other date was available.
