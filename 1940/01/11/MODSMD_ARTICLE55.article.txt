# One-Act for Glory
## 
### 
RAM'S HEAD'S second annual one-act play
contest this quarter offers three students a
chance to hear an audience applaud their work,
to get their names on a plaque. To the winners
of the contest will come a moment of publicity,
a review in The Daily after it is all over.
But if this alone were the result of the one
act play contest, Ram's Head would be wasting
its time. If the three winners alone were to
receive the glory and satisfaction of placing in
the money, the contest would defeat its own
ends.
Actually, however, this is not so. The victors
get only a fair share of the spoils and there are
enough prizes for everyone.
The real purpose of the contest is to promote
Stanford drama, to develop such native talent
as is available, to give the greatest possible
number a chance to take part in Stanford's the
atrical program.

Every person who contemplates a play and
submits it for judging has thereby earned an
interest in local theater. And, more than that,
he has gained actual experience in writing
plays, which is usually considered an essential
step in a playwright's career.
The playwrights who miss top billing will
not be the only beneficiaries of the consolation
prizes inherent in Ram's Head's annual tilt. The
actors, directors, costumers, stage hands, and all
others connected with the production of the
winning plays will spend a crowded month
backstage. Even the audience wins, since a
Stanford audience attending a production in
which play, direction, and action is by Stanford,
is bound to enjoy the show.
The experience gained in this activity is un
usually valuable, for it enables the students con
cerned with it to take part in the production of
a drama from the first writing to the final per
formance. Such a view of the whole process is
not to be obtained in any one of the separate
phases of play production.
So Ram's Head offers a contest, and every
body wins.—J. B.

backstage. Even the audience wins, since a
Stanford audience attending a production in
which play, direction, and action is by Stanford,
is bound to enjoy the show.
The experience gained in this activity is un
usually valuable, for it enables the students con
cerned with it to take part in the production of
a drama from the first writing to the final per
formance. Such a view of the whole process is
not to be obtained in any one of the separate
phases of play production.
So Ram's Head offers a contest, and every
body wins.—J. B.
