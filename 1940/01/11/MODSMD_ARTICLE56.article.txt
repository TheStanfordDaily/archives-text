### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
IN THE SHADOW OF LADY GUILLOTINE
A RATHER attractive young lady from the Row
glared at me on the English Corner today and
asked, "Do you know that you're in the dog-house
with every sorority on this campus?"
"No," I lied. A good many other young ladies had
already posted me on the way in which my sorority
comments had been received by the houses. Not
warmly, I understand, but hotly.
Strainedly controlling an impulse to choke me, the
attractive young lady went on. "How dare you say
such things about our sororities? Some things might
be true, but such exaggerations!"
"Ha, ha!" I forced myself to chuckle. "Can't you
take a joke?" But there I was, backed into another
incensed female.
"Our initiation fees are not $90! They're only $65."
"I had no idea you were offering such bargains," I
said, sidling away as rapidly as possible.
And that's the way it went all day. Just now, as I
was typing the last line, a sorority woman on the
Daily stafT bopped me over the head with a Stanford
register booklet. 1 am grateful that those booklets
aren't made any thicker.

\ T RISK of parting company with my head, and at
peril of becoming Stanford's William Lloyd Gar
rison, I cannot say that I believe the attractive young
ladies are largely in the right. Some of them even
admit that "half" of the criticism aimed at the female
Greeks is justified. But they are members of a group
that tends to think unanimously—at least on the sub
ject of sororities and columnists—and so they all de
fend their sisterly social system. This unanimity of
thought is in itself a weak point, I think. But of
course I'm prejudiced—in the interests of self-preser
vation.
I really didn't mean, however, that shallow social
tricks are common to all sorority women. 1 merely
meant that the tricks are, in general, fostered rather
than discouraged by sororities.
Neither did I mean that time bombs should be
placed under every sorority house on the campus. No
democratically-minded citizen would favor such a
method. It's economically wasteful and extremely dis
courteous.
To go one step farther, I might even say that
sororities do a number of really constructive things.
It must be quite a problem, for instance, to feed so
many dieting women. If that be treason, make the most
of it.
For tea and their principles the Bostonians defied
the British. But they didn't know how light a sacri
fice they were making: The wrath of females is far
worse.

already posted me on the way in which my sorority
comments had been received by the houses. Not
warmly, I understand, but hotly.
Strainedly controlling an impulse to choke me, the
attractive young lady went on. "How dare you say
such things about our sororities? Some things might
be true, but such exaggerations!"
"Ha, ha!" I forced myself to chuckle. "Can't you
take a joke?" But there I was, backed into another
incensed female.
"Our initiation fees are not $90! They're only $65."
"I had no idea you were offering such bargains," I
said, sidling away as rapidly as possible.
And that's the way it went all day. Just now, as I
was typing the last line, a sorority woman on the
Daily stafT bopped me over the head with a Stanford
register booklet. 1 am grateful that those booklets
aren't made any thicker.

\ T RISK of parting company with my head, and at
peril of becoming Stanford's William Lloyd Gar
rison, I cannot say that I believe the attractive young
ladies are largely in the right. Some of them even
admit that "half" of the criticism aimed at the female
Greeks is justified. But they are members of a group
that tends to think unanimously—at least on the sub
ject of sororities and columnists—and so they all de
fend their sisterly social system. This unanimity of
thought is in itself a weak point, I think. But of
course I'm prejudiced—in the interests of self-preser
vation.
I really didn't mean, however, that shallow social
tricks are common to all sorority women. 1 merely
meant that the tricks are, in general, fostered rather
than discouraged by sororities.
Neither did I mean that time bombs should be
placed under every sorority house on the campus. No
democratically-minded citizen would favor such a
method. It's economically wasteful and extremely dis
courteous.
To go one step farther, I might even say that
sororities do a number of really constructive things.
It must be quite a problem, for instance, to feed so
many dieting women. If that be treason, make the most
of it.
For tea and their principles the Bostonians defied
the British. But they didn't know how light a sacri
fice they were making: The wrath of females is far
worse.
IN THE SHADOW OF LADY GUILLOTINE
A RATHER attractive young lady from the Row
glared at me on the English Corner today and
asked, "Do you know that you're in the dog-house
with every sorority on this campus?"
"No," I lied. A good many other young ladies had
already posted me on the way in which my sorority
comments had been received by the houses. Not
