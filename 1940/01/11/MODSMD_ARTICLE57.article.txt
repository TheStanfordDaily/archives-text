# CAMPUS OPINION
## A.S.U. MARCHES ON 
### 
r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
I was glad to see that The Daily is concerned
about the A.S.U., about its leadership, and its program.
Since the leaders were elected by the membership,
comment on that score is unnecessary.
The program of the A.S.U. is a different matter. If
the A.S.U. is to be, as The Daily desires, an organiza
tion truly representative of the campus, it must have
a broad democratic program. The Daily also pointed
out that if the A.S.U. is to be representative of the
campus, the campus must be interested in the A.S.U.
Therefore, when the A.S.U. releases its program, con
sider it carefully, if you like it (as I believe you will)
join the A.S.U.; if you don't like it, join the A.S.U. and
change it.
We can never have the best possible program with
out your help.
Sincerely,
Dick Cecil
