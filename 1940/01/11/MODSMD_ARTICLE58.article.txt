# MADAME RAT, TO YOU!

### 
r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
D.J. sounds like lie ale pickles himself. And I'll
bet he doesn't mix soft drinks with them. Who is any
man to go around making comments about a woman's
weight? I notice that they accept their waist-lines
with a philosophic detachment that would help any
dieting girl's disposition.
How do you want us—svelte and non-cooperative
or chubby and easy going? Anyhow, it was nice of
him to admit that our hair doesn't fall out, but it
didn't take any abnormal insight. And, if my powers
of observation are functioning properly, the men
around here should be eating the whole wheat and
milk. Look at the captain of the football teem and the
Student Manager. In the future I shall discount all
these lame excuses about chlorinated water.

A NY GIRL who is turning yellow around campus
will undoubtedly be snagged by the health service;
so he needn't really worry. Is this "not knowing, never
having got below the make-up," comment of D. J.'s a
sign that he is a misogynist or some such? I'm sure
I could find him any number of perfectly normal girls
who would be glad to wash their faces for him.
And besides, what with rushing going on now, we'll
just have to eat catch-as-catch-can for some time.
Feeding the frosh for a week is putting a positive
cavern in our budgets, and we won't be eating cake
either. Pickles are cheap, though.
You bet we're not concrete rats. We are a lot more
malleable than that. And, in regard to any spiritual
nection we may have with rats —move over D. J.
Sincerely,
Sister Rat
