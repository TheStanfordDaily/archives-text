"THE LAST FLOWER," by James
Thurber; Harpers
"JOHN BLACKS BODY," by Ben
Martin; The Vanguard Press
The instant that Adolf Hitler and
Neville Chamberlain gave the word
for the bombs to start faJling on the
map of Europe, the American press
started pouring forth a steady
stream of "we must keep out of
war" material.
Not far behind the journalists are
the publishers who have produced
two telling little anti-war picture
books which put across their mes
sages far more effectively than most
of the reams of words that have
been written on the subject.
THURBER CHANGES TUNE
James Thurber, famed for his New
Yorker satires and cartoons of
shapeless neurotics, has drawn an
earnest, bitter plea for peace in "The
Last Flower."
Similar to his magazine sketches
in technique, though not in spirit,
the pictures and the single sentence
on each page depict the destruction
of civilization by World War XII,
the rebuilding of society, and the
completion of the cycle with another
destruction by another war.
The last flower on earth epitomizes
the message of Thurber's book. It. is
this bent blossom that interests the
last man and the last woman in life
again, teaches them what love is, and
is responsible for the perpetuation of
the human race. But this last flower
turns out to be the embryo of a
civilization that is bound to destroy
itself as long as soldiers exist and
wars are waged.
READING TIME SHORT
Although its reading time is but
three or four minutes, "The Last
Flower" is a completely effective
satire, and it holds up well under
continued rereadings.
Perhaps not quite as brilliant as
Thurber's work, but still an ex
tremely telling bit of pictorial irony
is Ben Martin's "John Black's Body."
With loosely drawn cartoons, some
what in the style of the popular
Ludwig Bemelmans, he tells ihe
story of all the money that was in
vested in Average Man John Black
and which went up in smoke when
he was killed in a war.
The quaintly materialistic view
point of this book makes an inter
esting contrast, with "The Last
Flower," which is really a lyric fable
with a sour ending. Both volumes
are potent illustrations of the fact

that war is the stupidest, most futile
thing ever invented by man.
And their punch is largely due to
the fact that they keep the reader
smiling while he is realizing the
ugly ti'uth.â€”L. L.
