### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
IF THE Allies lose the war America
must protect the heritage of
western culture.
This sounds as if it were a weighty
and highly moral trust. You can
see dim visions of America stand
ing alone with the bright flame of
civilization clutched aloft in one
valiant hand. This was not, how
ever, the vision that confronted
Congress yesterday when it met to
consider a billion dollar national de- j
fense bill. The picture shaded off
into a maze of tonnage figures and
dollar signs, cold, clear statistics
that told the story of American
naval expansion, rearmament on
land and sea.

It was a strong, definite warn
ing that the chief of naval opera
tions for the United States told
Congress — a warning that the
United States must plan on build
ing a navy strong enough to meet
any combination of enemies which
might strike at this hemisphere
if Great Britain and France are
defeated in the European struggle.
Admiral Ilarold Stark didn't say
specifically what coalition of pow
ers might possibly mobilize for an
attack on the Americas, but in pre
vious testimony he named Ger
many, Russia, Italy, and Japan as
potential enemies.
Supporting his demand for a 25
per cent increase in naval tonnage
called for in the billion-dollar Vin
son Expansion Bill before the naval
committee, Stark said:

<»»YV/E must face the possibility of
an Allied defeat and then
measure the strength of the powers
which might combine for action
against the Americas. If our navy
is weaker than the combined
strengths of potential enemies, then
our navy Is too small. It is too small
viewed from that angle; so there is
just one answer—an increase is nec
essary."
The United States has been
forced to revise its naval plans too
many times in the last few years.
First there was Munich. After
that small episode in 191)8 when
Chamberlain and his umbrella be
came famous by selling out the
Czechs, American defense re
quirements became "more ur
gent." Again on that fateful fall
day when the legions of Adolf
Hitler marched into Poland.
American defense experts began
further upward revisions of the
defense budget.
And now the 25 per cent increase,
Stark said, represents a compromise
figure that takes into consideration
what the navy can lay down and
build with existing facilities and
what the country can afford to pay
for strengthening its oceanic de
fenses.

SENATOR DAVID WALSH, Dem
ocrat from Massachusetts, chair
man of the Senate Naval Affairs
committee, introduced a decided
controversy when he expressed
disapproval of "building another
paper navy" until existing blue
prints were converted into a billion
dollars of warships.
The Vinson measure, it seems,
simply authorizes plans for con
structing additional ships and
doesn't call for funds to put the
program in operation. That's why
Walsh insists it's a "paper navy."
If. however, the bill were adopted,
construction could go ahead as
money is appropriated.

Representative Vinson, author of
the bill, said that Walsh was abso
lutely wrong. The whole issue may
develop into a nice debate, because
Vinson insists that all the ships will
be under actual construction by the
end of the 1941 fiscal year.

Stark indicated that the problem
had been studied by naval experts
from both the theoretical and prac
tical viewpoint. "Theoretically," he
said, "we should add units to bring
the U.S. fleet up to not less than
that required to defend the United
States, its interests and possessions."

western culture.
This sounds as if it were a weighty
and highly moral trust. You can
see dim visions of America stand
ing alone with the bright flame of
civilization clutched aloft in one
valiant hand. This was not, how
ever, the vision that confronted
Congress yesterday when it met to
consider a billion dollar national de- j
fense bill. The picture shaded off
into a maze of tonnage figures and
dollar signs, cold, clear statistics
that told the story of American
naval expansion, rearmament on
land and sea.

It was a strong, definite warn
ing that the chief of naval opera
tions for the United States told
Congress — a warning that the
United States must plan on build
ing a navy strong enough to meet
any combination of enemies which
might strike at this hemisphere
if Great Britain and France are
defeated in the European struggle.
Admiral Ilarold Stark didn't say
specifically what coalition of pow
ers might possibly mobilize for an
attack on the Americas, but in pre
vious testimony he named Ger
many, Russia, Italy, and Japan as
potential enemies.
Supporting his demand for a 25
per cent increase in naval tonnage
called for in the billion-dollar Vin
son Expansion Bill before the naval
committee, Stark said:

<»»YV/E must face the possibility of
an Allied defeat and then
measure the strength of the powers
which might combine for action
against the Americas. If our navy
is weaker than the combined
strengths of potential enemies, then
our navy Is too small. It is too small
viewed from that angle; so there is
just one answer—an increase is nec
essary."
The United States has been
forced to revise its naval plans too
many times in the last few years.
First there was Munich. After
that small episode in 191)8 when
Chamberlain and his umbrella be
came famous by selling out the
Czechs, American defense re
quirements became "more ur
gent." Again on that fateful fall
day when the legions of Adolf
Hitler marched into Poland.
American defense experts began
further upward revisions of the
defense budget.
And now the 25 per cent increase,
Stark said, represents a compromise
figure that takes into consideration
what the navy can lay down and
build with existing facilities and
what the country can afford to pay
for strengthening its oceanic de
fenses.

SENATOR DAVID WALSH, Dem
ocrat from Massachusetts, chair
man of the Senate Naval Affairs
committee, introduced a decided
controversy when he expressed
disapproval of "building another
paper navy" until existing blue
prints were converted into a billion
dollars of warships.
The Vinson measure, it seems,
simply authorizes plans for con
structing additional ships and
doesn't call for funds to put the
program in operation. That's why
Walsh insists it's a "paper navy."
If. however, the bill were adopted,
construction could go ahead as
money is appropriated.

Representative Vinson, author of
the bill, said that Walsh was abso
lutely wrong. The whole issue may
develop into a nice debate, because
Vinson insists that all the ships will
be under actual construction by the
end of the 1941 fiscal year.

Stark indicated that the problem
had been studied by naval experts
from both the theoretical and prac
tical viewpoint. "Theoretically," he
said, "we should add units to bring
the U.S. fleet up to not less than
that required to defend the United
States, its interests and possessions."
IF THE Allies lose the war America
must protect the heritage of
western culture.
