action of the 8.A.C., and promised
full support when the new mentor
takes over April 1.
The opinions were as follows:
HAMP POOL, varsity guard,
member of the 8.A.C., graduating
senior — "The Board stopped at
nothing to get the best man for
Stanford. I am positive that Clark
Shaughnessy is the man. I know
that if every student knew as much
as I do about the situation, he would
feel the same way."

FRANKIE ALBERT, halfback—"l
think it's swell. I don't know much
about him, but I'm satisfied that he
is a good choice."

NORM STANDLEE, fullback
"I'm glad it's settled, and I believe
the fellows will work for him.
Shaughnessy's appointment will
mean new enthusiasm."

ANDY STOJKOVICII, end, grad
uating senior—"Shaughnessy is one
of the greatest offensive coaches of
the game. The team will support
him. Now I'll just sit back and
watch."

GENE COLDIRON, quarterback,
graduating senior—"The selection is
a wise one. In Shaughnessy we will
have a man who has gone a long way
both scholastically and athletically."

JIM' GROVES, halfback, graduat
ing senior—"l'm rather disappointed
in the choice, as it seems his record
is poor."
COLIN McCLINTOCK, center —
"Tony Calvclli, center on the '38
varsity, played for the Chicago Bears
last season, and knew Shaughnessy
then. He says he's a fine strategist.
We won't have to worry about cam
pus support, but how about the
alumni?"
STAN GRAFF, end—"l'm sort of
surprised at the choice, but I feel
sure the B.A.C. picked the right man.
I hear he's a fine offensive coach,
and the men I've talked to like the
idea."

DOUCi STAHLE, center—"l un
derstand the Chicago Bears ofTered
him a job, so he mu.st be good."
KEN RORESKY, guard — "He
seems to be all right. I understand
he's quite a scholarly man."
JOHN CASEY, fullback—"O. K.
Except, that all I know about him is
what I read in the papers. I'm sure
he'll work right in with the squad."
MILT VUCINICII. freshman full
back—"Evidently a fine fellow. I
know he's a good coach, and I'm told
he is the typ of man that ball play
ers are willing to work for."
CHUCK TAYLOR, freshman
quarterback "Very good. Very sat
isfied, and I'll be glad to see him.
The players I've talked to will l>c
glad to work under him."
DON SELRY, freshman halfback
"I hear that most other coaches rate
him as one of the best in the busi
ness. I expect he'll fit right in here."

MILT VUCINICII. freshman full
back—"Evidently a fine fellow. I
know he's a good coach, and I'm told
he is the typ of man that ball play
ers are willing to work for."
CHUCK TAYLOR, freshman
quarterback "Very good. Very sat
isfied, and I'll be glad to see him.
The players I've talked to will l>c
glad to work under him."
DON SELRY, freshman halfback
"I hear that most other coaches rate
him as one of the best in the busi
ness. I expect he'll fit right in here."
Displaying closely parallel opin
ions, 14 members of the varsity and
freshman football squads commented
yesterday upon the selection of Clark
Shaughnessy as head coach. With
few exceptions, they acclaimed the
action of the 8.A.C., and promised
full support when the new mentor
takes over April 1.
The opinions were as follows:
HAMP POOL, varsity guard,
member of the 8.A.C., graduating
senior — "The Board stopped at
nothing to get the best man for
Stanford. I am positive that Clark
Shaughnessy is the man. I know
that if every student knew as much
as I do about the situation, he would
feel the same way."

FRANKIE ALBERT, halfback—"l
think it's swell. I don't know much
about him, but I'm satisfied that he
is a good choice."

NORM STANDLEE, fullback
"I'm glad it's settled, and I believe
the fellows will work for him.
Shaughnessy's appointment will
mean new enthusiasm."

ANDY STOJKOVICII, end, grad
uating senior—"Shaughnessy is one
of the greatest offensive coaches of
the game. The team will support
him. Now I'll just sit back and
watch."

GENE COLDIRON, quarterback,
graduating senior—"The selection is
a wise one. In Shaughnessy we will
have a man who has gone a long way
both scholastically and athletically."

JIM' GROVES, halfback, graduat
ing senior—"l'm rather disappointed
in the choice, as it seems his record
is poor."
COLIN McCLINTOCK, center —
"Tony Calvclli, center on the '38
varsity, played for the Chicago Bears
last season, and knew Shaughnessy
then. He says he's a fine strategist.
We won't have to worry about cam
pus support, but how about the
alumni?"
STAN GRAFF, end—"l'm sort of
surprised at the choice, but I feel
sure the B.A.C. picked the right man.
I hear he's a fine offensive coach,
and the men I've talked to like the
idea."

DOUCi STAHLE, center—"l un
derstand the Chicago Bears ofTered
him a job, so he mu.st be good."
KEN RORESKY, guard — "He
seems to be all right. I understand
he's quite a scholarly man."
JOHN CASEY, fullback—"O. K.
Except, that all I know about him is
what I read in the papers. I'm sure
he'll work right in with the squad."
