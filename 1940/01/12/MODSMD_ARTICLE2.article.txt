# Nazi Planes Raid British East Coast
## Air Battles Fought Over Firth of Forth; Coast Ships Blasted 
### United Press 
The people of the British Isles re
ceived their biggest dose of war thus
lar when German planes roared
across a 500-mile stretch of the
Scottish and English east coasts
Thursday in raids that might have
been forerunners of Field Marshal
Goering's promised aerial "blitz
krieg."
Air battles were fought at six
points along the coast as swift Brit
ish spitfire fighters went into the air
against the German Heinkel bomb
ers and Dornier flying boats, and
anti-aircraft guns blazed daylong.
Again the German raids were
aimed at Britain's vital Firth of Forth
naval anchorage and coastal ship
ping and —for the first time since the
start of the war—the great New
castle-on-Tyne shipbuilding yards
were raided.
NO BOMBS DROPPED
The British Aid Ministry indicat
ed that, the raiders had dropped no
bombs on land, although five ships
near the coast were machine-gunned
and bombed by the German avia
tors before they were driven off. A
merchant ship was set ablaze off
the Norfolk coast, a trawler was
damaged off Scotland and three cargo
vessels were saved from bombing
by the timely arrival of British
planes.
The intensified German raids ap
peared to have been an answer to
the British Air Force's attack Wed
nesday on Germany's Sylt Island
seaplane base off Jutland where, ac
cording to Danish reports, bombs
damaged a dam and causeway con
necting the island with the German
mainland.
PLANES DOWNED
In the wake of raids along the
English and Scottish coasts, a Ger
man Heinkel bomber whose empty
bomb rack seemed evidence that it
was returning from an attack, was
forced down last night on Danish
territory and its four crew members
immediately set it afire. It was the
second German plane forced down
on Danish territory in 24 hours. A
third German plane, described by
the Nazis as an unarmed transport,
was forced down in Belgium. Bel
gium authorities prepared to protest
to Berlin against the landing of a
Messerschmitt plane on Belgian ter
ritory yesterday and the flight of
German planes over the little
country again today.

FINNS HEAR GUNFIRE
The war in Finland was brought
close to the capital city of Helsinki
Thursday when residents of the
partly evacuated city heard the loud
fire of what appeafed to be coastal
artillery guns on the nearby Gulf
of Finland coast. It. was indicated
that the guns were beating off a
Russian attack, either by sea or air,
on the Finnish fortresses there.

The Finnish high command re
ported two new victories over the
invaders on the bitterly cold north
ern fronts—near Petsamo just below
the Arctic coast and around Salla to
the north of Finland's "wasp waist"
where a large Russian force was re
ported facing a trap.
WESTERN FRONT LIVELY

Things were livelier on the west
ern front, with a series of air bat
tles and clashes between German
and French patrols. The Nazis ad
mitted that a French company in a
strong surprise attack had "broken
into' the German lines cast, of For
bach but said the enemy was re
pulsed and that a number of dead
and wounded Poilus were left in
No-Man's-Land.

the Arctic coast and around Salla to
the north of Finland's "wasp waist"
where a large Russian force was re
ported facing a trap.
WESTERN FRONT LIVELY

Things were livelier on the west
ern front, with a series of air bat
tles and clashes between German
and French patrols. The Nazis ad
mitted that a French company in a
strong surprise attack had "broken
into' the German lines cast, of For
bach but said the enemy was re
pulsed and that a number of dead
and wounded Poilus were left in
No-Man's-Land.
The people of the British Isles re
ceived their biggest dose of war thus
lar when German planes roared
across a 500-mile stretch of the
Scottish and English east coasts
Thursday in raids that might have
been forerunners of Field Marshal
Goering's promised aerial "blitz
krieg."
Air battles were fought at six
points along the coast as swift Brit
ish spitfire fighters went into the air
against the German Heinkel bomb
ers and Dornier flying boats, and
anti-aircraft guns blazed daylong.
Again the German raids were
aimed at Britain's vital Firth of Forth
naval anchorage and coastal ship
ping and —for the first time since the
start of the war—the great New
castle-on-Tyne shipbuilding yards
were raided.
NO BOMBS DROPPED
The British Aid Ministry indicat
ed that, the raiders had dropped no
bombs on land, although five ships
near the coast were machine-gunned
and bombed by the German avia
tors before they were driven off. A
merchant ship was set ablaze off
the Norfolk coast, a trawler was
damaged off Scotland and three cargo
vessels were saved from bombing
by the timely arrival of British
planes.
The intensified German raids ap
peared to have been an answer to
the British Air Force's attack Wed
nesday on Germany's Sylt Island
seaplane base off Jutland where, ac
cording to Danish reports, bombs
damaged a dam and causeway con
necting the island with the German
mainland.
PLANES DOWNED
In the wake of raids along the
English and Scottish coasts, a Ger
man Heinkel bomber whose empty
bomb rack seemed evidence that it
was returning from an attack, was
forced down last night on Danish
territory and its four crew members
immediately set it afire. It was the
second German plane forced down
on Danish territory in 24 hours. A
third German plane, described by
the Nazis as an unarmed transport,
was forced down in Belgium. Bel
gium authorities prepared to protest
to Berlin against the landing of a
Messerschmitt plane on Belgian ter
ritory yesterday and the flight of
German planes over the little
country again today.

FINNS HEAR GUNFIRE
The war in Finland was brought
close to the capital city of Helsinki
Thursday when residents of the
partly evacuated city heard the loud
fire of what appeafed to be coastal
artillery guns on the nearby Gulf
of Finland coast. It. was indicated
that the guns were beating off a
Russian attack, either by sea or air,
on the Finnish fortresses there.

The Finnish high command re
ported two new victories over the
invaders on the bitterly cold north
ern fronts—near Petsamo just below
the Arctic coast and around Salla to
the north of Finland's "wasp waist"
where a large Russian force was re
