# Dugan Constructs Model of War Libe
## 
### 
If you stand across the Adminis
tration Building lobby from the
model of the Hoover Library which
has been placed there, you can get
an idea of how the real structure
will look from the rim of the Frost
Memorial Amphitheater. Fire Chief
Robert E. Dugan of the Firehouse
built the model.
The miniature library is built on
a scale of a quarter of an inch to
the foot, and was made from left
over rough ends of lumber. The
model is complete with red roof and
statue of liberty on the top. The
sandy finish of the structure resem
bles the sandstone found in Quad
buildings.
