# Lawson, Shipkey To Retain Posts As Assistant Coaches
## 
### 
His 1925 Tulane midgets, the 168-
, pound team, was the first Southern
[ team ever to be invited to the Rose
I Bow! classic. The Administration
turned down the offer because the
team was too small. Two of his
! halfbacks there, Alfred Broun and
Peggy Flourney, were almost unani-
I mo us All-American halfbacks.
i In Shaughnessy's first season at
Tulane the total attendance at all
! games was 7,500. The Green Wave
had but one mud-soaked practice
i field and seemed hopelessly in debt.
; The new coadh built them the largest
stadium in the South and played to
! 35,000 in his farewell game, an ex
tremely large attendance in the deep
I South.

I COACHED AT LOYOLA
In 1927 he accepted a similar post
jat Loyola in New Orleans and re
mained there until called by Chicago
.in 1933.
Shaughnessy is 47 years old, of
Irish descent, weighs 190 pounds and
is exactly 6 leet tall. He is married
and has three children, the eldest of
whom is Clark, Jr., U.C.L.A.'s crack
senior javelin thrower.
Most encouraging news to many
campus followers of football is
Shaughnessy's assertion that he has

! the greatest faith in both Jim Law
j son, varsity assistant, and Harry
j Shipkey, freshman coach. Both these
I men will unquestionably retain their
j present positions, but outside help
j may possibly be employed for the
! backfield and line coaching assign
j ments if the new headman so desires.
