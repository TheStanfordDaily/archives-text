# Rain keeps Frosh Ball Club Indoors
## 
### 
Rainy weather is still keeping
Stanford's freshman baseball team
inside. Coach Harry Shipkey has
been putting his pitchers and catch
ers through indoor workouts and
skull practices are held five days a
week until the diamond dries off.
Shipkey appears to have the
nucleus of a last ball club this sea
son. There are bright chances for a
strong infield, although there is a
shortage of good pitching prospects
so far. Starting the second week in
February, two games a week will be
run off until the three-game series
with Cal in April.
