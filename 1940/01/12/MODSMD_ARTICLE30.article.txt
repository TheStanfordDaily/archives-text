# Frosh Cagers Heady for Tilt With Salinas
## ream in Top Shape For Contest Tonight On Local Court, 6:30 
### 
Finishing up the week's practice
j program with a fairly tough work
out last night, Coach Beeb Lee's
| frosh basketball team will do its
| best to take it easy today, despite
: formal pledging, in order to be in
top shape for its game with Salinas
j Junior College tonight at 6:30 o'clock
in the Pavilion.
Tonight's contest is probably the
; biggest hurdle the Stanford frosh
j have yet had to top, for Salinas
; boasts one of its best teams in years
and shows a record to date of seven

victories as against three defeats.
Ed Adams has coached his team in a
set offense, with lots of fast breaking
which has proved very effective so
far.
FUNAIiIKI'S DEFENSE GOOD
However, Walt Funabiki, diminu
tive guard, showed himself to be a
top-notch defender against fast
breaks in the game last Saturday
night against San Jose High School.
And with the rest of the boys play
ing heads-up ball, the frosh may be
able to slow down the Salinas out
fit considerably.
Giving his team only an even
chance to come out of this week
end's contest with a pair of victo
ries, Coach Lee said. "If our first
team had been working together as
a unit longer, I'd say that perhaps
we'd be slight, favorites. But as it is,
the game is a toss-up." he added.
FARM'S OPPONENTS TALL
The frosh will run up against
quite a bit of height tonight and to
morrow night, with the Salinas team
averaging 6:1, and George Washing
ton's front line will be even taller,
being the tallest Stanford has met,
although the guards on the eastern
team are of only average height.
In tonight's game Lee will start
Jack Dana and Ross Meyer at for
wards. Ed Voss at center, and John
Eikleman and Walt Funabiki.

ries, Coach Lee said. "If our first
team had been working together as
a unit longer, I'd say that perhaps
we'd be slight, favorites. But as it is,
the game is a toss-up." he added.
FARM'S OPPONENTS TALL
The frosh will run up against
quite a bit of height tonight and to
morrow night, with the Salinas team
averaging 6:1, and George Washing
ton's front line will be even taller,
being the tallest Stanford has met,
although the guards on the eastern
team are of only average height.
In tonight's game Lee will start
Jack Dana and Ross Meyer at for
wards. Ed Voss at center, and John
Eikleman and Walt Funabiki.
