# Hoop, Handball Top Quarters Mural Parade
## New Forfeit Rule Expected to Speed Action in All Sports 
### 
All decks are cleared for action,
arid everything is ready for the
grand getaway Monday of Stanford's
winter quarter intramural program.
Handball and basketball are the two
sports on tap for this quarter and
plenty of tight competition is ex
pected.
A.T.O. and Business School I, de
fending champions in basketball and
handball, respectively, are again
entering strong teams and stand a
good chance of repeating their per
formances of last year.
The intramural program is ex
pected to be run off in fine style
henceforth because of the new rul
ing which was put into effect at an
intramural meeting lasi week. The
rule is lo the effect that any team
which forfeits one contest in any
one sport, or two contests in dif
ferent sports loses its points for
those sports, but is not barred from
further competition. However, if
any team forfeits two games in one
sport or three games in different
sports, that team is out of any in
tramural competition whatsoever for
the remainder of the school year.
II any organization enters two
teams in one sport, forfeits by either
of those teams are counted against
the organization sponsoring them.
That is, if El Ropo enters two bas
ketball teams in the intramurals and
each one of those teams forfeits
once, El Ropo is automatically bar
red from all intramural competition
for the remainder of the year.
