# Tilden Schedules Exhibition Games
## 
### 
Big Bill Tilden. the iron man of
the tennis world, is at it again.
Tennis exhibition matches in the
San Jose Civic Auditorium next
Thursday night will feature three
sets between Tilden and Fred Perry,
who at one time or another has held
every major amateur singles title in
the world.
Tilden is still the big drawing
card. The 46-year-old master still
can play on even terms with the
best pros in the business, and his
matches in the current tour have
been scheduled so as to give him
plenty of rest between performances.
Tickets are on sale in Palo Alto at
Roos Brothers.
