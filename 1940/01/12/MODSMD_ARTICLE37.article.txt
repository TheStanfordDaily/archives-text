### JERRY MAYER 
SIIAK.HNFSKY OFFICIALLY
CONFIRMED AS NEW COACH
Clark Daniel Shaughnessy, who
suddenly found himself a director of
intramural athletics instead of a
football coach at the University of
Chicago, now finds himself over
night catapulted to the position of
head football coach at Stanford.
Although rumors the last few days
have had Shaughnessy pegged for
the position, nevertheless student
reaction yesterday as the news
spread around the campus seemed
to be one of surprise. While the
students undoubtedly had hunches
that Buck Shaw and Dud DeGroot,
who were the popular choices on
campus, were losing ground, an
ouncament of the ex-Chicago coach's
choice brought considerable adverse
comment.

Sideline Slants led the van
guard of student support for Shaw
and DoGroot, strictly on the basis
<il The Daily's poll, but now that
Shaughnessy is "in," we are going
to hack him to the limit, if for no
ether reason than the fact that he
is STANFORD'S coach, and our
future on the gridiron for the next
live years or more will ride on his
shoulders.

Dissension and internal strife
have too lon# been rile in Stan
ford's football set-up. If there is
ivnything that Shaughnessy will
need to insure him even a fair
chance of bringing the Indians out
of the doldrums, it is co-operation.
He'll get it from The Stanford
Daily.

Much is made of the fact that the
last two schools Shaughnessy hay.
coached at discontinued football
during his regime, and while that
does make good material for jests, ;;
they can be explained. Loyola of
New Orleans, a small college, gave
up the sport for lack of finances,
while Chicago will undoubtedly be
come a graduate school.
Before he went to Loyola, Shaugh
nessy was at Tulane for 12 years,
bringing that school from the bot
tom of the football ladder to a posi
tion of prominence in the grid I
world. He is known among coaches, I
who should know if anyone does, as
one of the most progressive leaders !
in the business.

VVe are not worired about
Shaughnessy as a coach. He is as
good as they come. What we are |
wondering is how the devil we're ;
going to lit that name in headlines, j

SIIAK.HNFSKY OFFICIALLY
CONFIRMED AS NEW COACH
Clark Daniel Shaughnessy, who
suddenly found himself a director of
intramural athletics instead of a
football coach at the University of
Chicago, now finds himself over
night catapulted to the position of
head football coach at Stanford.
Although rumors the last few days
have had Shaughnessy pegged for
the position, nevertheless student
reaction yesterday as the news
spread around the campus seemed
to be one of surprise. While the
students undoubtedly had hunches
that Buck Shaw and Dud DeGroot,
who were the popular choices on
campus, were losing ground, an
ouncament of the ex-Chicago coach's
choice brought considerable adverse
comment.

Sideline Slants led the van
guard of student support for Shaw
and DoGroot, strictly on the basis
<il The Daily's poll, but now that
Shaughnessy is "in," we are going
to hack him to the limit, if for no
ether reason than the fact that he
is STANFORD'S coach, and our
future on the gridiron for the next
live years or more will ride on his
shoulders.

Dissension and internal strife
have too lon# been rile in Stan
ford's football set-up. If there is
ivnything that Shaughnessy will
need to insure him even a fair
chance of bringing the Indians out
of the doldrums, it is co-operation.
