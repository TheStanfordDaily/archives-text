# Enter Mr. Shaughnessy
## 
### 
DRAWING aside the curtains of mystery,
yesterday the Board of Athletic Control
proudly presented Stanford with a new football
coach.
The selection of Clark Shaughnessy of the
University of Chicago to fill the not-too-com
fortable shoes of Tiny Thomhill came as a
surprise to most of the campus, especially to
those who had been putting their money on
Buck Shaw and Dud DeGroot.
Students close to the football picture were
almost unanimous in expressing their approval
of the appointment. Others, who only know
what they read in the newspapers, were dis
mayed that the B.A.C. should have picked a man
with as unimpressive a record as Shaughnessy's
has been during the past few years.
However, it is unfair to judge Clark Shaugh
nessy on the basis of the landslide losses he has
suffered in recent seasons. The determination
of President Robert M. Hutchins of Chicago to
crush proselyting of athletes and over-emphasis
on football would have killed the sport, no mat
ter who was coaching it.

Adding to Chicago's dropping intercollegiate
football the fact that Loyola of New Orleans,
where Shaughnessy coached in the late '20's
and early '30's, also dropped the sport, recently
led a San Francisco sports writer to conclude,
"wherever he has coached, football has died."

The injustice of this remark is immediately
apparent in the case of Chicago. And it is
equally unfair in the matter of Loyola, where a
skyrocket attempt to enter big-time football
failed to pay sufficient dividends.
But there are brighter days in Big Ten com
petition and sensational successes at Tulane of
which Stanford's new headman can boast. He
comes to Stanford with the recommendation of
almost every leading coach and gridiron au
thority in the country.

Clark Shaughnessy is supposed to.be a very
exceptional man. He will have to be to handle
the position of head football coach at Stanford.
First, he will have to know how to handle
alumni who will insist on telling him how to
run his squad. Certain wealthy graduates who
donate athletic scholarships always feel that
they have purchased the right to interfere with
the coaching of the team.

Any man who is going to make a successful
Stanford football coach must be able to tell these
alumni to go climb a tree when they insist that
either he plays their men or they will withdraw
their financial aid.

Second, Clark Shaughnessy will find that he
is entering the Pacific Coast Conference just at
the uncomfortable time when its members have
instituted a clean-up of proselyting and have
appointed Edwin N. Atherton chief policeman to
see that all rules are obeyed.

Third, the new coach will have to deal with
a group of football players who have had abso
lutely no respect for the authority of their coach
for the past three years, either on or off the field.
The actions of many of these men when they
have been representing Stanford on trips are
conclusive evidence that they felt no obligation
and little loyalty for their mentor. And it will
be up to Shaughnessy to win the respect of the
men who played on these teams.
Fourth, he will have to capture the admiration
and enthusiasm of one of the most indifferent
student bodies on any campus. He will have
to convince not only the 500 men and women
who voted for Shaw and DeGroot in the foot
ball poll, but also the 3,500 who were not inter
ested enough to cast a ballot, that he is the right
man for the job.
Judging from all advance reports, Clark
Shaughnessy is one of the few men in the
country capable of overcoming these opposing
forces.
Let us hope that at the close of his first season
he will have standing firmly behind him a
united Stanford, an enthusiastic Stanfordâ€”the
old Stanford.
