FOR more than half of Encina's freshmen this
may seem like the most important day of the
year.
This afternoon they will take the step from
which there is no returning. They will pledge
fraternities.
All the promises they have made, all the
meals they have eaten at other houses will be
forgotten in an overpowering burst of enthu
siasm for their chosen brotherhood.

Many of the frosh who pledge today will
move up the Row next year to remain there until
they graduate, playing cards or pool or golf,
or slinging the bull with the brothers.
This is a dangerous aspect of fraternity life.
Houses are not as all-important at Stanford as
they are on other campuses, but they do offer
convenient refuges from the new thoughts and
activities which are the most valuable features
of college life.
If every freshman that dashes up the Row
this afternoon will realize that he is not leaving
the rest of the campus behind, that his interest
in Stanford as a whole need to no extent be
lessened by his interest in his fraternity, he
will have no occasion to regret three and one
half years that he never learned to
know his way around at college.
To get the most out of fraternity life, it must
be viewed in the light of its own importance, not
in an exaggerated perspective.
Those pledge pins on your lapels will feel
awfully big tonight, frosh, but they still do not
hide your faces.
