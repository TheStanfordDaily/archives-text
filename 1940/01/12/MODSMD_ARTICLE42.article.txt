ON THE NATION'S HONOR ROLL
"NATION," Oswald Garrison Villard's maga
zine for liberals, has selected its annual "honor
roll"—a list of the American men and women whom
they believe have contributed most to society in 1939.
The list covered a wide variety of occupations: Charles
Evans Hughes, Senator Robert Wagner, John Stein
beck, Arthur Eggleston (San Francisco columnist),
and Carl Sandburg were a few of the men.
But probably most interesting to Stanford students
was the inclusion on the list of three Stanford pro
fessors. For their discovery of a cure for syphilis that
can be taken orally, Drs. P. J. Hanzlik, A. J. Lehman,
and A. P. Richardson were nationally applauded. How
ever provincial it may be, anyone affiliated with Stan
ford cannot help feeling a sense of pride in the humani
tarian achievement of three men who are a part of
this University. It is perhaps an unjustified pride for
most of us, who had nothing to do with the profes
sors' scientific success. But we can self-satisfactorily
if tritely excuse ourselves by saying "it's only natural."

A SIDE from this "natural" feeling of pride, in being
parts of the same institution as are nationally
recognized scientists, there Ls a second interest that
we have in any such constructive service. Every day
newspapers blaringly call to our attention the seem
ingly hopeless plight of a hard-pressed civilization.
The principle of might makes right—or its current ex
tension, brutality is best—sometimes comes close to
imbuing any ambitious student with implacable pes
simism. And, even if it is a purely emotional reaction,
humanitarian achievements of any kind help to main
tain the encouragement that prevents cynicism.
Hence, even wedged as it is between Nazi-British
air raids, the work of Stanford's scientists has con
tributed to more than medicine. It has also contrib
uted to the vitality of our morale.
It may be "womanish" or sentimental to glean a
livable amount of optimism from the cure of disease,
especially when no one seems to be finding a cure for
death by bombing. And bombed people usually stop
breathing at least as readily as mortally sick patients.
But people are inclined to feel that when intelligence
and altruism are still functional somewhere, there is
still hope.
And for the duration of the wax-, at least, an in
clination to hope can be an adequate substitute for
belief. Who knows? Maybe hoping, rather than seeing,
is synonymous with believing.

fessors. For their discovery of a cure for syphilis that
can be taken orally, Drs. P. J. Hanzlik, A. J. Lehman,
and A. P. Richardson were nationally applauded. How
ever provincial it may be, anyone affiliated with Stan
ford cannot help feeling a sense of pride in the humani
tarian achievement of three men who are a part of
this University. It is perhaps an unjustified pride for
most of us, who had nothing to do with the profes
sors' scientific success. But we can self-satisfactorily
if tritely excuse ourselves by saying "it's only natural."

A SIDE from this "natural" feeling of pride, in being
parts of the same institution as are nationally
recognized scientists, there Ls a second interest that
we have in any such constructive service. Every day
newspapers blaringly call to our attention the seem
ingly hopeless plight of a hard-pressed civilization.
The principle of might makes right—or its current ex
tension, brutality is best—sometimes comes close to
imbuing any ambitious student with implacable pes
simism. And, even if it is a purely emotional reaction,
humanitarian achievements of any kind help to main
tain the encouragement that prevents cynicism.
Hence, even wedged as it is between Nazi-British
air raids, the work of Stanford's scientists has con
tributed to more than medicine. It has also contrib
uted to the vitality of our morale.
It may be "womanish" or sentimental to glean a
livable amount of optimism from the cure of disease,
especially when no one seems to be finding a cure for
death by bombing. And bombed people usually stop
breathing at least as readily as mortally sick patients.
But people are inclined to feel that when intelligence
and altruism are still functional somewhere, there is
still hope.
And for the duration of the wax-, at least, an in
clination to hope can be an adequate substitute for
belief. Who knows? Maybe hoping, rather than seeing,
is synonymous with believing.
ON THE NATION'S HONOR ROLL
"NATION," Oswald Garrison Villard's maga
zine for liberals, has selected its annual "honor
roll"—a list of the American men and women whom
they believe have contributed most to society in 1939.
The list covered a wide variety of occupations: Charles
Evans Hughes, Senator Robert Wagner, John Stein
beck, Arthur Eggleston (San Francisco columnist),
and Carl Sandburg were a few of the men.
But probably most interesting to Stanford students
was the inclusion on the list of three Stanford pro
fessors. For their discovery of a cure for syphilis that
can be taken orally, Drs. P. J. Hanzlik, A. J. Lehman,
and A. P. Richardson were nationally applauded. How
