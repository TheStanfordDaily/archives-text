r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
From all authoritative sources, Clark Shaugh
nessy is a leader in the field of physical education, a
great coach, and a fine fellow. To quote one of his
many enthusiastic supporters, "Let anyone that is
doubtful about this selection talk to Clark Shaugh
nessy for ten minutes and the doubtful one will leave
the room a strong and enthusiastic supporter of
Shaughnessy."
There is no reason in the world why the entire
student body cannot meet Coach Shaughnessy at the
station as his train rolls in. There is less reason why
we shouldn't march up to the Memorial Theater and
hear a few words from our coach. In other words, let's
give him a real Stanford reception.
