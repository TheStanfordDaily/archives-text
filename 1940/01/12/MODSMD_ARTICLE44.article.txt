# A 						SISTER SPEAKS

r JPHE EDITOR, SIR:
It seems to me that there has been too much
criticism of sororities on this campus and not enough
praise of their worthwhile features. But that, of
course, is a typically male attitude—inability to think
straight when thinking about women. It takes a
woman to criticize a woman; this becomes very appar
ent when women are discussing women. (That last
sentence is just like a man's head; it has too many
"women" in it.)
Anyway, what I am trying to say is that sororities
give every girl who joins a house a chance to develop
her character. Living with a group of other girls
makes necessary a spirit of give and take—especially
take. Just getting used to observing the common
customs of the house, for instance, demands co-opera
tion.' And every well-bred college girl should learn
co-operation. It is as much a part of education as any
other kind of general background or culture.

r JPHOSE who criticize sororities seem to think that it
is the best possible thing to make girls complete
individualists. But I should like to know if girls really
ought to be so anti-social. Maybe it. is a better idea
to prepare ourselves for future social life by learning
to be social. That certainly sounds more logical than
learning to be social by being anti-social. Or maybe
that is too obvious for the complex masculine mind.
Another distinct advantage of living in a sorority
is the wonderful living accommodations provided.
Breaking girls up into groups makes it possible to
have more comfort in each house. Of course, our
critic would probably like us to live without comforts,
like pioneers or something. Well, living without com
forts is just as ridiculous as being anti-social, and there
is really no excuse for it.
There are many other points in favor of sororities
which would be obvious to anyone who has lived in
them. But that, like clear thought on the subject, is
beyond the reach of individuals wearing pants.
So listen to the girls' side of the discussion from the
girls, Mr. Editor. The girls' side, let me assure you,
is not uninteresting.
