# Notice to Escapists: Try Sonja's "Dream-on-Ice"
## 
### 
"EVERYTHING HAPPENS AT NIGHT," now playing at the Fox Stanford.
If you have a cold brought on by California's seasonable downpour and
you want to get away from rushing, or what have you, go see the Twen
tieth-Century Fox dreani-on-ice. Sonja Ilenie, in her current film, "Every
thing Happens at Night." There isn't too much of a story; but there are

lots of handsome people and
ing lines in what there is, and a
beautiful "waltz-on-skates" scene j
which is one of the best things to be 1
seen on the screen at present (ex
cepting, of course, that minor mir- !
acle of the Old South, ("G. W. j
W.T.").
Sonja is the daughter of a famous j
political figure who faked his own !
death to escape the pursuing arm of
a certain totalitarian state. He takes
refuge in a small Swiss village un
der an assumed name, with Sonja
masquerading as his nurse.
CHASED BY GESTAPO
There arrives on the scene an
American reporter for the Paris
edition of the New York Herald
Tribune and a journalist (pipe the
title) from the London Daily Mail.
The plot goes berserk at this point,
with the addition later of the Ges
tapo and an old-fashioned chase
scene.
Robert Cummings and Ray Mil
land. the reporter and journalist, re
spectively, are very good as the
rather Hollywoodish newspapermen.
Moreover, they wear the fanciest
assortment of male ski togs ever
seen in this hemisphere. Cummings
is a graduate /rom Deanna Durbin
supporting casts, and promises, with
a bit more experience, to add a fresh ,
face and a gift for comedy to the
ranks of the Powers and the Gables.
SNOW SCENES BEAUTIFUL
An excellent supporting cast fea
turing Maurice 'Moskovitch, and
some beautiful snow scenes help to
raise the general level of the pro- :
ceedings.
Also playing is "The Cisco Kid
and the Lady" wtih Cesar Romero
and Marjorie Weaver. I haven't
seen it, but it's a second feature.â€”
