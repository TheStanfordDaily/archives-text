# SHAUGHNESSY GETS COACHING JOB
## Former Chicago Headman Signs Five-year Contract To End Search for Talent Student Dope Bucket, Sportswriter 'Experts' Upset as Dark Horse Emerges to Win Director's Post 
### ARCH JENKINS 
Clark Daniel Shaughnessy, the University of Chicago's
; forgotten man of intercollegiate athletics, yesterday accepted
via telephone the formal offer of Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur to
! coach football at Stanford for the next five years.
Shaughnessy, distinctly a dark horse candidate as far as
j the student body and the general public were concerned, was
i named unanimously for the position officially termed "Direc
! tor of Football" at an executive session of the Board of Ath-

I letic Control last Sunday night. President Wilbur approved
the selection and tenure of contract Tuesday and Shaughnessy
telephoned his final acceptance to the President's office shortly
before noon yesterday.

i His approval of the contract, together with Dr. Wilbur's
1 formal consent to the agreement, precludes any necessity of
! another Board meeting tonight.

The secrecy that the B.A.C. has thrown over the entire
; selection proceedings since Claude "Tiny" Thornhill was
I ousted shortly after the end of the 1939 season has made front
J page sport news all over the country. Few of the writers,
| however, suspected that Shaughnessy would ultimately be
| nominated for the position.

Local sentiment had been strongly in favor of Buck Shaw of
Santa Clara or Dud De(iroot of San Jose State Teachers' College.
These and other favorite son candidates, however, were gradually
weeded out in favor of a man who had almost complete backing from
the writers and experts who have followed his career as well as the
genuine support of all the major coaches who only recently con
cluded their annual convention at Los Angeles.

It was at this convention, incidentally, that Shaughnessy created
his U-st impression, both in jjerson and through the hundreds of
informed men who pointed to him as the most eligible man in the
field.

NEW COACH IMPRESSED NEARLY EVERYONE
A1 Masters, general manager of the Hoard, William Owens, and
Walter Ames, faculty and alumni members respectively, consulted
nearly every mentor at the coaches' conclave as well as authoritative
sports scribes on tin* scene. Shaughncssy was unquestionably their
man, but Dr. Thomas Storey, director of hygiene and physical edu
cation, was scanning all available material in the East and Middle
West while the stay-at-home members continued to survey the local
talent.

Shaughncssy, partially through a desire to visit in San brandsco
and partially through the encouragement offered him by the IbA.C ..
then left for a week of almost unnoticed meetings with the other six
members, lie also met a number of the Stanford coaches, some of
the players, and other representatives of the Hoard and the Admin
istration.

His personal character coupled with the overwhelming recom
mendations which had piled up in his favor left nothing but linal
action to keep him out of the headman's job. Shaughncssy stated
late yesterday that he was "flattered" by the appointment and that he
would submit bis resignation to Chicago authorities soon and hoped
to be on the job by April 1.
