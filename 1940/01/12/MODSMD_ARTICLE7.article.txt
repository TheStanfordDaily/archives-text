# SHAUGHNESSY GETS COACHING JOB
## Former Chicago Headman Signs Five-year Contract To End Search for Talent Student Dope Bucket, Sportswriter 'Experts' Upset as Dark Horse Emerges to Win Director's Post 
### ARCH JENKINS 
Clark Daniel Shaughnessy, the University of Chicago's
; forgotten man of intercollegiate athletics, yesterday accepted
via telephone the formal offer of Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur to
! coach football at Stanford for the next five years.
Shaughnessy, distinctly a dark horse candidate as far as
j the student body and the general public were concerned, was
i named unanimously for the position officially termed "Direc
! tor of Football" at an executive session of the Board of Ath-

I letic Control last Sunday night. President Wilbur approved
the selection and tenure of contract Tuesday and Shaughnessy
telephoned his final acceptance to the President's office shortly
before noon yesterday.

i His approval of the contract, together with Dr. Wilbur's
1 formal consent to the agreement, precludes any necessity of
! another Board meeting tonight.

The secrecy that the B.A.C. has thrown over the entire
; selection proceedings since Claude "Tiny" Thornhill was
I ousted shortly after the end of the 1939 season has made front
J page sport news all over the country. Few of the writers,
| however, suspected that Shaughnessy would ultimately be
| nominated for the position.

Local sentiment had been strongly in favor of Buck Shaw of
Santa Clara or Dud De(iroot of San Jose State Teachers' College.
These and other favorite son candidates, however, were gradually
weeded out in favor of a man who had almost complete backing from
the writers and experts who have followed his career as well as the
genuine support of all the major coaches who only recently con
cluded their annual convention at Los Angeles.

It was at this convention, incidentally, that Shaughnessy created
his U-st impression, both in jjerson and through the hundreds of
informed men who pointed to him as the most eligible man in the
field.

NEW COACH IMPRESSED NEARLY EVERYONE
A1 Masters, general manager of the Hoard, William Owens, and
Walter Ames, faculty and alumni members respectively, consulted
nearly every mentor at the coaches' conclave as well as authoritative
sports scribes on tin* scene. Shaughncssy was unquestionably their
man, but Dr. Thomas Storey, director of hygiene and physical edu
cation, was scanning all available material in the East and Middle
West while the stay-at-home members continued to survey the local
talent.

Shaughncssy, partially through a desire to visit in San brandsco
and partially through the encouragement offered him by the IbA.C ..
then left for a week of almost unnoticed meetings with the other six
members, lie also met a number of the Stanford coaches, some of
the players, and other representatives of the Hoard and the Admin
istration.

His personal character coupled with the overwhelming recom
mendations which had piled up in his favor left nothing but linal
action to keep him out of the headman's job. Shaughncssy stated
late yesterday that he was "flattered" by the appointment and that he
would submit bis resignation to Chicago authorities soon and hoped
to be on the job by April 1.
"I didn't expect it," he told the
United Press in the Windy City. 1
just received formal notification of i
! my appointment. Although I have j
enjoyed my stay at Chicago, I'd
much rather coach intercollegiate |
i football than intramural football.
Now I'll be able to follow my pro- 1
fession again."
The approval of President Wilbur
was short, yet showed signs of much
careful consideration. Shaughnessy
likewise appealed to the Adminis
tration as an exceptional candidate,
exemplifying the higher qualities of
sportsmanship and educational qual
ities upon which they had insisted.
ADMINISTRATION PLEASED
"The tentative recommendations
| made to me by the Board of Athletic
Control," the President's note said,
j "have been carefully considered and
1 I have been able to act upon them
in such a way as to bring about the
acceptance at this time by Mr. Clark |
Shaughnessy of the position of Di- 1
rector of Football for a term of five !
i years."
Shaughnessy's record since 1933 as J
winning coach at Chicago has been |
I seriously hampered by a policy of j
| de-emphasis. Experts rated his ma
terial as on a par with the average j
junior college variety. Ten-cent ad- j
mission charges as sponsored by j
President Robert Hutchins and a
total lack of athletic scholarships ]
doomed his chances from the begin- |
j ning; and the graduate status of the
! school, with, most men coming in as
junior or senior transfer students, 1
j lowered the eligible list to an al
most negative figure.
STILL HAD SUCCESS
Shaughnessy, for example, pre
i sented a list of 40 prospects to the !
Committee on Eligibility early last
! fall. Twenty-three of these were ]
' immediately turned down, leaving

him with a squad of 23. Shaugh
nessy, however, has not been with
out some success in his present po
sition. His best pupil there, of course,
was the immortal all-AVnerican Jay
Berwanger, closest thing to a one
man football team in the history of
the game. Shaughnessy's material
was so weak that Berwanger was
allowed to scrimmage only once un
der Shaughnessy after his first
game.

GIVES UP POSITION
Shaughnessy, in accepting the In
dian post, is giving up a position as
director of intramural athletics
which reputedly pays him between
$7500 and $10,000 a year. When he
turned down the offer of a famous
New England institution recently,
the Chicago officials gave him a life
tenureship which would have made
him eligible for retirement on pen
sion in 18 more years. No salary
stipulations were announced in the
new position, but it is assumed that
the Board and the Administration
either met or went over his present
salary.

He comes to Stanford with 26
years in the intercollegiate coaching
profession behind him, 25 of them as
head coach or athletic director.
Born in St. Cloud, Minnesota, on
March 6, 185)2. he matriculated at
the University of Minnesota and
graduated there in 1914 with a Bach
elor of Arts degree. He was a three
sport winner in track, basketball, and
football.
In 1912 and 1913, he was selected
by different award groups as all-Big
Ten member in three diffcrnt posi
tions—'tackle, end, and fullback. He
ran the 440 and the 880 in track and
also competed in practically every
field event.
Immediately after graduation, he
became assistant coach at Minne
sota but left at the start of the 1915
season to take over the athletic
directorship and head football coach
position at Tulane. He dropped the
directorship in 1922 and remained as
football mentor through the 1926 sea
son.

Shaughnessy, for example, pre
i sented a list of 40 prospects to the !
Committee on Eligibility early last
! fall. Twenty-three of these were ]
' immediately turned down, leaving

him with a squad of 23. Shaugh
nessy, however, has not been with
out some success in his present po
sition. His best pupil there, of course,
was the immortal all-AVnerican Jay
Berwanger, closest thing to a one
man football team in the history of
the game. Shaughnessy's material
was so weak that Berwanger was
allowed to scrimmage only once un
der Shaughnessy after his first
game.

GIVES UP POSITION
Shaughnessy, in accepting the In
dian post, is giving up a position as
director of intramural athletics
which reputedly pays him between
$7500 and $10,000 a year. When he
turned down the offer of a famous
New England institution recently,
the Chicago officials gave him a life
tenureship which would have made
him eligible for retirement on pen
sion in 18 more years. No salary
stipulations were announced in the
new position, but it is assumed that
the Board and the Administration
either met or went over his present
salary.

He comes to Stanford with 26
years in the intercollegiate coaching
profession behind him, 25 of them as
head coach or athletic director.
Born in St. Cloud, Minnesota, on
March 6, 185)2. he matriculated at
the University of Minnesota and
graduated there in 1914 with a Bach
elor of Arts degree. He was a three
sport winner in track, basketball, and
football.
In 1912 and 1913, he was selected
by different award groups as all-Big
Ten member in three diffcrnt posi
tions—'tackle, end, and fullback. He
ran the 440 and the 880 in track and
also competed in practically every
field event.
Immediately after graduation, he
became assistant coach at Minne
sota but left at the start of the 1915
season to take over the athletic
directorship and head football coach
position at Tulane. He dropped the
directorship in 1922 and remained as
football mentor through the 1926 sea
son.
Clark Daniel Shaughnessy, the University of Chicago's
; forgotten man of intercollegiate athletics, yesterday accepted
via telephone the formal offer of Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur to
! coach football at Stanford for the next five years.
Shaughnessy, distinctly a dark horse candidate as far as
j the student body and the general public were concerned, was
i named unanimously for the position officially termed "Direc
! tor of Football" at an executive session of the Board of Ath-

I letic Control last Sunday night. President Wilbur approved
the selection and tenure of contract Tuesday and Shaughnessy
telephoned his final acceptance to the President's office shortly
before noon yesterday.

i His approval of the contract, together with Dr. Wilbur's
1 formal consent to the agreement, precludes any necessity of
! another Board meeting tonight.

The secrecy that the B.A.C. has thrown over the entire
; selection proceedings since Claude "Tiny" Thornhill was
I ousted shortly after the end of the 1939 season has made front
J page sport news all over the country. Few of the writers,
| however, suspected that Shaughnessy would ultimately be
| nominated for the position.

Local sentiment had been strongly in favor of Buck Shaw of
Santa Clara or Dud De(iroot of San Jose State Teachers' College.
These and other favorite son candidates, however, were gradually
weeded out in favor of a man who had almost complete backing from
the writers and experts who have followed his career as well as the
genuine support of all the major coaches who only recently con
cluded their annual convention at Los Angeles.

It was at this convention, incidentally, that Shaughnessy created
his U-st impression, both in jjerson and through the hundreds of
informed men who pointed to him as the most eligible man in the
field.

NEW COACH IMPRESSED NEARLY EVERYONE
A1 Masters, general manager of the Hoard, William Owens, and
Walter Ames, faculty and alumni members respectively, consulted
nearly every mentor at the coaches' conclave as well as authoritative
sports scribes on tin* scene. Shaughncssy was unquestionably their
man, but Dr. Thomas Storey, director of hygiene and physical edu
cation, was scanning all available material in the East and Middle
West while the stay-at-home members continued to survey the local
talent.

Shaughncssy, partially through a desire to visit in San brandsco
and partially through the encouragement offered him by the IbA.C ..
then left for a week of almost unnoticed meetings with the other six
members, lie also met a number of the Stanford coaches, some of
the players, and other representatives of the Hoard and the Admin
istration.

His personal character coupled with the overwhelming recom
mendations which had piled up in his favor left nothing but linal
action to keep him out of the headman's job. Shaughncssy stated
late yesterday that he was "flattered" by the appointment and that he
would submit bis resignation to Chicago authorities soon and hoped
to be on the job by April 1.
"I didn't expect it," he told the
United Press in the Windy City. 1
just received formal notification of i
! my appointment. Although I have j
enjoyed my stay at Chicago, I'd
much rather coach intercollegiate |
i football than intramural football.
Now I'll be able to follow my pro- 1
fession again."
The approval of President Wilbur
was short, yet showed signs of much
careful consideration. Shaughnessy
likewise appealed to the Adminis
tration as an exceptional candidate,
exemplifying the higher qualities of
sportsmanship and educational qual
ities upon which they had insisted.
ADMINISTRATION PLEASED
"The tentative recommendations
| made to me by the Board of Athletic
Control," the President's note said,
j "have been carefully considered and
1 I have been able to act upon them
in such a way as to bring about the
acceptance at this time by Mr. Clark |
Shaughnessy of the position of Di- 1
rector of Football for a term of five !
i years."
Shaughnessy's record since 1933 as J
winning coach at Chicago has been |
I seriously hampered by a policy of j
| de-emphasis. Experts rated his ma
terial as on a par with the average j
junior college variety. Ten-cent ad- j
mission charges as sponsored by j
President Robert Hutchins and a
total lack of athletic scholarships ]
doomed his chances from the begin- |
j ning; and the graduate status of the
! school, with, most men coming in as
junior or senior transfer students, 1
j lowered the eligible list to an al
most negative figure.

then left for a week of almost unnoticed meetings with the other six
members, lie also met a number of the Stanford coaches, some of
the players, and other representatives of the Hoard and the Admin
istration.

His personal character coupled with the overwhelming recom
mendations which had piled up in his favor left nothing but linal
action to keep him out of the headman's job. Shaughncssy stated
late yesterday that he was "flattered" by the appointment and that he
would submit bis resignation to Chicago authorities soon and hoped
to be on the job by April 1.
"I didn't expect it," he told the
United Press in the Windy City. 1
just received formal notification of i
! my appointment. Although I have j
enjoyed my stay at Chicago, I'd
much rather coach intercollegiate |
i football than intramural football.
Now I'll be able to follow my pro- 1
fession again."
The approval of President Wilbur
was short, yet showed signs of much
careful consideration. Shaughnessy
likewise appealed to the Adminis
tration as an exceptional candidate,
exemplifying the higher qualities of
sportsmanship and educational qual
ities upon which they had insisted.
ADMINISTRATION PLEASED
"The tentative recommendations
| made to me by the Board of Athletic
Control," the President's note said,
j "have been carefully considered and
1 I have been able to act upon them
in such a way as to bring about the
acceptance at this time by Mr. Clark |
Shaughnessy of the position of Di- 1
rector of Football for a term of five !
i years."
Shaughnessy's record since 1933 as J
winning coach at Chicago has been |
I seriously hampered by a policy of j
| de-emphasis. Experts rated his ma
terial as on a par with the average j
junior college variety. Ten-cent ad- j
mission charges as sponsored by j
President Robert Hutchins and a
total lack of athletic scholarships ]
doomed his chances from the begin- |
j ning; and the graduate status of the
! school, with, most men coming in as
junior or senior transfer students, 1
j lowered the eligible list to an al
most negative figure.
STILL HAD SUCCESS
Shaughnessy, for example, pre
i sented a list of 40 prospects to the !
Committee on Eligibility early last
! fall. Twenty-three of these were ]
' immediately turned down, leaving

him with a squad of 23. Shaugh
nessy, however, has not been with
out some success in his present po
sition. His best pupil there, of course,
was the immortal all-AVnerican Jay
Berwanger, closest thing to a one
man football team in the history of
the game. Shaughnessy's material
was so weak that Berwanger was
allowed to scrimmage only once un
der Shaughnessy after his first
game.

GIVES UP POSITION
Shaughnessy, in accepting the In
dian post, is giving up a position as
director of intramural athletics
which reputedly pays him between
$7500 and $10,000 a year. When he
turned down the offer of a famous
New England institution recently,
the Chicago officials gave him a life
tenureship which would have made
him eligible for retirement on pen
sion in 18 more years. No salary
stipulations were announced in the
new position, but it is assumed that
the Board and the Administration
either met or went over his present
salary.

He comes to Stanford with 26
years in the intercollegiate coaching
profession behind him, 25 of them as
head coach or athletic director.
Born in St. Cloud, Minnesota, on
March 6, 185)2. he matriculated at
the University of Minnesota and
graduated there in 1914 with a Bach
elor of Arts degree. He was a three
sport winner in track, basketball, and
football.
In 1912 and 1913, he was selected
by different award groups as all-Big
Ten member in three diffcrnt posi
tions—'tackle, end, and fullback. He
ran the 440 and the 880 in track and
also competed in practically every
field event.
Immediately after graduation, he
became assistant coach at Minne
sota but left at the start of the 1915
season to take over the athletic
directorship and head football coach
position at Tulane. He dropped the
directorship in 1922 and remained as
football mentor through the 1926 sea
son.
Clark Daniel Shaughnessy, the University of Chicago's
; forgotten man of intercollegiate athletics, yesterday accepted
via telephone the formal offer of Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur to
! coach football at Stanford for the next five years.
Shaughnessy, distinctly a dark horse candidate as far as
j the student body and the general public were concerned, was
i named unanimously for the position officially termed "Direc
! tor of Football" at an executive session of the Board of Ath-

I letic Control last Sunday night. President Wilbur approved
the selection and tenure of contract Tuesday and Shaughnessy
telephoned his final acceptance to the President's office shortly
before noon yesterday.

i His approval of the contract, together with Dr. Wilbur's
1 formal consent to the agreement, precludes any necessity of
! another Board meeting tonight.

The secrecy that the B.A.C. has thrown over the entire
; selection proceedings since Claude "Tiny" Thornhill was
I ousted shortly after the end of the 1939 season has made front
J page sport news all over the country. Few of the writers,
| however, suspected that Shaughnessy would ultimately be
| nominated for the position.

Local sentiment had been strongly in favor of Buck Shaw of
Santa Clara or Dud De(iroot of San Jose State Teachers' College.
These and other favorite son candidates, however, were gradually
weeded out in favor of a man who had almost complete backing from
the writers and experts who have followed his career as well as the
genuine support of all the major coaches who only recently con
cluded their annual convention at Los Angeles.

It was at this convention, incidentally, that Shaughnessy created
his U-st impression, both in jjerson and through the hundreds of
informed men who pointed to him as the most eligible man in the
field.

NEW COACH IMPRESSED NEARLY EVERYONE
A1 Masters, general manager of the Hoard, William Owens, and
Walter Ames, faculty and alumni members respectively, consulted
nearly every mentor at the coaches' conclave as well as authoritative
sports scribes on tin* scene. Shaughncssy was unquestionably their
man, but Dr. Thomas Storey, director of hygiene and physical edu
cation, was scanning all available material in the East and Middle
West while the stay-at-home members continued to survey the local
talent.

; forgotten man of intercollegiate athletics, yesterday accepted
via telephone the formal offer of Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur to
! coach football at Stanford for the next five years.
Shaughnessy, distinctly a dark horse candidate as far as
j the student body and the general public were concerned, was
i named unanimously for the position officially termed "Direc
! tor of Football" at an executive session of the Board of Ath-

I letic Control last Sunday night. President Wilbur approved
the selection and tenure of contract Tuesday and Shaughnessy
telephoned his final acceptance to the President's office shortly
before noon yesterday.

i His approval of the contract, together with Dr. Wilbur's
1 formal consent to the agreement, precludes any necessity of
! another Board meeting tonight.

The secrecy that the B.A.C. has thrown over the entire
; selection proceedings since Claude "Tiny" Thornhill was
I ousted shortly after the end of the 1939 season has made front
J page sport news all over the country. Few of the writers,
| however, suspected that Shaughnessy would ultimately be
| nominated for the position.

Local sentiment had been strongly in favor of Buck Shaw of
Santa Clara or Dud De(iroot of San Jose State Teachers' College.
These and other favorite son candidates, however, were gradually
weeded out in favor of a man who had almost complete backing from
the writers and experts who have followed his career as well as the
genuine support of all the major coaches who only recently con
cluded their annual convention at Los Angeles.

It was at this convention, incidentally, that Shaughnessy created
his U-st impression, both in jjerson and through the hundreds of
informed men who pointed to him as the most eligible man in the
field.

NEW COACH IMPRESSED NEARLY EVERYONE
A1 Masters, general manager of the Hoard, William Owens, and
Walter Ames, faculty and alumni members respectively, consulted
nearly every mentor at the coaches' conclave as well as authoritative
sports scribes on tin* scene. Shaughncssy was unquestionably their
man, but Dr. Thomas Storey, director of hygiene and physical edu
cation, was scanning all available material in the East and Middle
West while the stay-at-home members continued to survey the local
talent.

Shaughncssy, partially through a desire to visit in San brandsco
and partially through the encouragement offered him by the IbA.C ..
then left for a week of almost unnoticed meetings with the other six
members, lie also met a number of the Stanford coaches, some of
the players, and other representatives of the Hoard and the Admin
istration.

His personal character coupled with the overwhelming recom
mendations which had piled up in his favor left nothing but linal
action to keep him out of the headman's job. Shaughncssy stated
late yesterday that he was "flattered" by the appointment and that he
would submit bis resignation to Chicago authorities soon and hoped
to be on the job by April 1.
"I didn't expect it," he told the
United Press in the Windy City. 1
just received formal notification of i
! my appointment. Although I have j
enjoyed my stay at Chicago, I'd
much rather coach intercollegiate |
i football than intramural football.
Now I'll be able to follow my pro- 1
fession again."
The approval of President Wilbur
was short, yet showed signs of much
careful consideration. Shaughnessy
likewise appealed to the Adminis
tration as an exceptional candidate,
exemplifying the higher qualities of
sportsmanship and educational qual
ities upon which they had insisted.
ADMINISTRATION PLEASED
"The tentative recommendations
| made to me by the Board of Athletic
Control," the President's note said,
j "have been carefully considered and
1 I have been able to act upon them
in such a way as to bring about the
acceptance at this time by Mr. Clark |
Shaughnessy of the position of Di- 1
rector of Football for a term of five !
i years."
Shaughnessy's record since 1933 as J
winning coach at Chicago has been |
I seriously hampered by a policy of j
| de-emphasis. Experts rated his ma
terial as on a par with the average j
junior college variety. Ten-cent ad- j
mission charges as sponsored by j
President Robert Hutchins and a
total lack of athletic scholarships ]
doomed his chances from the begin- |
j ning; and the graduate status of the
! school, with, most men coming in as
junior or senior transfer students, 1
j lowered the eligible list to an al
most negative figure.
STILL HAD SUCCESS
Shaughnessy, for example, pre
i sented a list of 40 prospects to the !
Committee on Eligibility early last
! fall. Twenty-three of these were ]
' immediately turned down, leaving

him with a squad of 23. Shaugh
nessy, however, has not been with
out some success in his present po
sition. His best pupil there, of course,
was the immortal all-AVnerican Jay
Berwanger, closest thing to a one
man football team in the history of
the game. Shaughnessy's material
was so weak that Berwanger was
allowed to scrimmage only once un
der Shaughnessy after his first
game.

GIVES UP POSITION
Shaughnessy, in accepting the In
dian post, is giving up a position as
director of intramural athletics
which reputedly pays him between
$7500 and $10,000 a year. When he
turned down the offer of a famous
New England institution recently,
the Chicago officials gave him a life
tenureship which would have made
him eligible for retirement on pen
sion in 18 more years. No salary
stipulations were announced in the
new position, but it is assumed that
the Board and the Administration
either met or went over his present
salary.

He comes to Stanford with 26
years in the intercollegiate coaching
profession behind him, 25 of them as
head coach or athletic director.
Born in St. Cloud, Minnesota, on
March 6, 185)2. he matriculated at
the University of Minnesota and
graduated there in 1914 with a Bach
elor of Arts degree. He was a three
sport winner in track, basketball, and
football.
In 1912 and 1913, he was selected
by different award groups as all-Big
Ten member in three diffcrnt posi
tions—'tackle, end, and fullback. He
ran the 440 and the 880 in track and
also competed in practically every
field event.
Immediately after graduation, he
became assistant coach at Minne
sota but left at the start of the 1915
season to take over the athletic
directorship and head football coach
position at Tulane. He dropped the
directorship in 1922 and remained as
football mentor through the 1926 sea
son.
