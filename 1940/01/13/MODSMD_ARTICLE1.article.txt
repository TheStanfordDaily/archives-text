# Cards Trim Bruins 53-38, As Deanmen Win Loop Opener
## 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
U.C.L.A. is still a long way from winning a Pacinc Coast Conler
ence Southern Division b.isketball game as Staniord proved in defeat
ing the muins, 58-36, last night. Li that ineory runs true to form
Coach Everett Deans colorful quintet should be able to help Bre'r
Bruin stretcn his losing conterence streak to suaigiit in the Pavilion

.il S o'clock tonight.
Although the Uclans showed up
fairly well on the scoring side of
the ledger, the Southerners still
left a great ileal to lie desired.
Under a new coach, Wilbur Johns,
the Bruins showed that there is one
man upon whom the Indians to
night and other conference clubs
will have to put a tight clamp.
ROBINSON TOPS
He is Jackie Robinson, a feared
footballer last fall, who has brought
his threatened break-away grid tac
tics to the hardwood. Jack person
ally scored two-thirds of his team's
field goals, and won high scoring
honors by dropping seven foul
shots for 2.5 pointsâ€”one more than
Stanford's Don Williams. 11 is total
might have been even higher but
early in he fray he missed four foul
throws, and a couple of long tins
rimmed the basket but plopped out.
WILLIAMS STARS
The smoothest scoring man on
the floor was Co-Capt. Williams,
who accounted for 10 of the Indians'
22 field goals. Blocking, screening,
and passing to Williams was as
nearly perfect as possible and as a
result he had lots of time to make
his shots. He went out of the game
after .50 minutes of play, leading
the scorers at that time. Except
for a long deadly sidecourt shot at
the start of the game, all of Will
iams' baskets were executed from
nidrr the basket or around the foul
circle.
Co-Lapt. Ken Davidson, who
went out on personal fouls in the
second half after guarding Robin
son fairly effectively all evening,
was third high scorer with 13
points. Fordy Anderson dropped
in six points.
Success of the first night's stand
against the Bruins can be attribut
ed chiefly to the steady passing and
the excellent floor-play of Williams,
Davidson, and Anderson. However,
towering Dick Taylor, the center,
although scoring but one point, was
strong in controlling the ball off
the backboard, and seldom did the
Uclans have a chance to take more
than one close shot after missing a
long one.
COWDEN STARS
Bill Cowden, the only soph from
last year's frosh outfit, was as much
a defensive star as Williams and
Davidson were offensive.
The Bruins' criss-cross, fast
moving offense failed to work for
more than one shot. Never were
ihe Indians fooled by their maneu
vers as Bruin screen and block
tactics were sloppily executed.
1 hirty-two fouls were called.
Halftime score was 31-18.
California, put behind the eight
bail in the first half down in Los
Angeles, never were able to recover
from a 13-point (deficit and lost
their opener to the Trojans, 49-36.
Cal's defending titlists meet the
Indians next Friday night in the
Pavilion.
