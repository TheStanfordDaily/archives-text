# A.S.U. Statement On Russ-Finn War Still To Come
## 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
Will the Stanford American Stu
dent Union retuse to brand Russia
an aggressor nation?
Mill unanswered, this question
was today further postponed for
the third time this week by A.S.U.
officers.
"We don't want to say anything
till Sunday," said Gene Glasinann,
past president. "It's not ready yet;
I have to look up some more
things," she added.
POSTPONEMENTS
Miss Glasinann was designated
by President Dick Cecil to release
the resolution presumably drawn up
by the membership at a meeting
last Sunday, postponed until a meet
ing I hursday, at which time it was
postponed until yesterday.
Action on such a resolution was
instigated by the recent A.S.I . Nat
ional Convention which refused to
brand Russia as an aggressor in
its hinland war.
Making his first official statement
as president of the local chapter,
Cecil yesterday said, "I'd like to
stress emphatically there is no con
flict between the Co-operative Book
store and the A.5.U.," and stated
that a recent Daily editorial sus
pecting a lack of cooperation was
incorrect.
CO-OP RESOLUTION
A definitely-worded resolution on
this score, as reached by Cecil and
Russel Curtis, head of the book
store, was also postponed. This
one is due Monday, according to
Cecil.
Concerning future A. S. I". Pol
icy, "I think that the standard by
which we judge every resolution
and every move at present is peace.
If we think something is going to
help us to stay out 'of war, we're
for it; and if we think it's going to
help us get into war, we're against
it.
"We may make mistakes in judge
ment, and if we do it's up to the
student body to change them. Since
the A.S.U. is a democratic organi
zation it can be done very easily."'
"Larry Livingston, as chairman
of the Peace Council, i-- assured of
all A.S.U. support in any effort
which will help us out of war."
PEACE MEETING
Dr. Martin Hall of the German-
American League of Culture will
address an A.S.U. meeting, open to
the public, on "What price peace in
Europe?" Wednesday evening at 8
o'clock in the Women's Clubhouse.
Speaking on the migrant labor
problem, Carey McWilliams, state
commissioner of immigration and
housing, will address the A.S.U. at
the last meeting of the month Jan.
31 in the Women's Clubhouse.
Commissioner McWilliams is
known for his hook, "Factories in
the Field," hailed as a factual back
ground for John Steinbeck's "Grapes
of Wrath," according to Cecil.
Both meetings have been approv
ed by the Committee on Public Ex
ercises, headed by Dr. Edgar E.
Robinson.

The Daily thanks Jeanne Cutler,
Pan-Hellenic president for her co
operation on this issue.
