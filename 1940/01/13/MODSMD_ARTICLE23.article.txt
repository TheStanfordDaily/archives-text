# Roble Shuns Pledge Week Hysterics
## 
### M. J. MONTGOMERY 
Maybe the women of the class of
'43 have heard the truth that senior
women on both sides of the imag
inary Hall-Row barrier are always
glad that they have lived in the
place they chose as freshmen. May
be they are just trying to bre;ik the
tradition which says Ro'ble has
hysteria pledge week.
At any rate, with the same old
ratio of pledged and unpledged,
Roble has had less hysteria to ac
company its rushing and its pledg
ing this year than have previous
classes.
REALIGNMENT
Tonight marks the beginning of
realignment among the women in
the class of '43 who have chosen,
either through initiative or lack of
an alternative, to affiliate them
selves with one of nine sororities
or with the hall majority.
While it is to be questioned that
there is a sorority for every girl,
non-sorority women may live in a
Lagunita Court of 288, an Elm Cot
tage of 13, or any other size living
group to which they choose to
adapt themselves. They may choose
a place for broad acquaintances or
intimate ones, or both.
Madrono, which is approximately
the size of a sorority house, is favor
ed traditionally as the Greek letter
houses dominate the pledge week
scene. Also traditionally, as spring
quarter begins to end, freshmen
hate to leave Roble and will prefer
to continue the hall set-up in Lag
unita or Union.
NO ABRUPT CHANGE
For no Roble resident will the
change to her upper class living
group be abrupt. While the hund
red women behind the pledge pins
dine on Lasuen twice weekly, Lag
unita and Union groups will have a
series of events to begin sophomore
orientation.
These teas and luncheons will be
gin before some 140 women have
made the final choice of rooms for
next year, and will continue, after
the choice, anvong those who will
live together next year.
Just as this year's junior class is
known for the much-publicized re
volt which ended just in time to
keep it from accomplishing any
thing, Roble sponsors this year pre
dict that the present freshman class
will be marked by an absence of
the preclusive cliques which usually
restrict themselves to their own
corners of the lobby during winter
quarter.
CLASS UNITY
If that should be the case, Roble
women will continue to live accord
ing to their present living group
instead of their future onesâ€”and
that will be class unity.
Sophomore luncheons and the
Sadie Hawkins Hop prove that this
kind of class unity does not termin
ate in a summer vacation. So next
year when sophomores are con
forming to or being independent of
their new surroundings, they can
remain the Class of '43 without
leap year to cement the tic.
