# Sisters Bewail Rushing Nerves
## 
### 
"The one thing I like about rush
ing," said one Row lassie last night,
"is the free cigarettes. Oh, we all
like the new women and having
them join us, but the process is
just too hectic. For every nugget
snagged, somebody gets a bad case
of rushing nerves!" This same dam
sel added that her first reaction on
being rushed last year was "How
wonderful to be in a house where
there arc always cigarettes lying
around whenever you want them!"
Main complaint about rushing
from sorority women in general
seems to be that the restriction of
natural, normal contact through in
creasingly strict rushing rules pre
vents them from getting really ac
quainted with women they arc
pledging. "Artificial, strained, and
stupid," they label the system, but
they all have something to say.
JUDGING HARD
"As for the criticism that we
judge prospective pledges on a
superficial basis," clamored an irate
sorority upperclassman, "with the
present plan of rushing, what other
basis do we have a chance to decide
upon ?"
A tired panhellenic delegate stat
ed recently, "The one thing I'd like
to tell the Robleites each year is,
'Relax! We're as scared as you
are!'"
That the entire week is an annual
headache seems to be the opinion
of a large percentage of sisters
under-the-pin.
RUSH HEADACHE
"In our house we have a 'We
Hate Rushing Club," explained an
other disillusioned Row affiliate.
"Towards the end of the week
we felt less and less like rush
ing, and we thought the freshmen
must feel the same way. So we
were going to call ours up and tell
them they didn't have to come."
