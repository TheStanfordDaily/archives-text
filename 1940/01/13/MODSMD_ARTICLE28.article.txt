Half-way through tlie hrst half
the lrosii tound, themselves on the
stiuri end ol a 10-lo score, but held
goals by Koss Meyer, Walt Funa
biki, and Jack Dana sent Beeb Lee's
boys into a lead which they never
relinquished throughout the re
mainder ol the contest.
lilG MARGIN
Going into the second half with
an 11 point advantage at Jtt-18, the
Papoose quintet built it up midway
through the period to 09-24, the
biggest margin ot the game, mostly
011 baskets by Fred Linari and
Meyer.
Jack Dana, son of Herb Dana,
former Commissioner of Pacific
Coast Conference officials, was the
scoring star of the game with 18
points to his credit, tallying all of
these in the hrst half as lie went
scoreless in the second canto when
the frosh were out-scored by a 15-
14 margin.
Coach H. B. Lee was satisfied
with the play of his charges last
night, declaring it a big improve
ment over last week's contests.
OFFENSE GOOD
"Although we still need some
work on individual defense," said
Lee, "1 thought that our offense
was greatly improved, especially
our fast break 011 which many of
our points were scored."
Although his scoring total slipped
to 4 points for last night's game,
"Big Ed" Voss, 6 foot 6 inch cen
ter, turned in his best defensive
game so far, doing exceptionally
well 011 backboard rebounds. Walt
Funabiki, game-captain last night,
came through with his usual good
game, holding his man to three
points scored.
FROSH PLAY TONIGHT
Tonight in the Pavilion at 6:30
o'clock Coach Lee's boys match
baskets with George Washington
High School from San Francsico.
Coached by Lloyd Leith, one of the
outstanding basketball officials in
the country, George Washington
will field a team with a very good
record, and prospects loom for a
fast battle.
Lee is considering starting Linari,
who has been playing exceptionally
good basketball, in tonight's game
in place of Meyer or John Eikle
man. If so, Linari will go in at
forward and Meyer will move back
to guard.
