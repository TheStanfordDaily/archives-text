# Sororities Pledge 99
## Alpha Phi Signs 14 to Lead Close-Matched Rushing Race 
### 
Ninety-nine women students, 14 less than in 1939, had trekked up
the Row when the final check-up of pledges was made tonight. Of the
new pledges, 89 belong to the class of '43, three are sophomores, seven
are juniors.
Alpha Phi leads the pledge list gathering in 14 new members.

• 111cy arc trailed closely by Kappa
Alpha Tlieta and Kappa Kappa
Gamma, with 13 pledges each.
Delta Delta Delta and Chi Omega
followed with 11 each, Delta
Gamma and I'i Phi with 10, Gamma
I 'hi Beta with nine, and Alpha
Omicron I'i with eight complete
the list.
LEAD CHANGES HANDS
The Gamma Phis led last year
with 17 newcomers, breaking Delta
Gamma's two-year monopoly of the
field. The Tri-Dclts pledged lb in
1939, to place second in the listings.
In 1938 the Row s nine sororities
managed to push through the
"Roble Rebellion" and hang pins
on 89 pledges, a feat accomplished
chiefly through frantic last-minute
politics and a little appropriate
sisterly insistence. But the Roble
Hall Putsch nearly wrecked the
sororities.
They came up with a bounce in
! the following year, however, and
pledged a strong 113.
SENSIBLE PLEDGING
Pledging this year, according to
observers on the Row and in Roble,
was marked by an encouragingly
sensible attitude on the part of the
Roble residents. Little or no hys
terics, only a little over-excitement
—-this is the record that the sorori
ties, and the freshmen, attained this
year. Sorority leaders are agreed
that a "safe and sane" pledge per
iod will help strengthen the once
weakened positions of sororities on
the Farm.
