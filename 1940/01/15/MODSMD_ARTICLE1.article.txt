### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
W/'HEN the sudden breath of win
ter swept across the Continent,
German and French troops alike
settled down in their concrete
walled dugouts along the Maginot
and Siegfried lines. Heavy artillery
spoke occasionally from rain-soaked
camouflages; only in the shadow of
the Arctic circle the Finns were
staging a ski tournament; the West
wall was quiet.
Ink-spattered headlines pro
claimed new sea warfare, new dis
asters in the Channel and the North
Sea—mines and subs, but no fight
ing on the Western Front.
Into this cauldron of crystal
lized, static warfare that housed
the smouldering chemistry of hate,
some new element was poured. It
shifted the carefully-regulated
balance, brought about a notice
able changc of pace. The leth
argy of winter warfare in western
Europe shifted to dynamic activ

came so persistent that it bor
dered on fact, a rumor that German
legions were massing along the Bel
gian and Dutch boundaries, the two
small neutral powers in the "cock
pit of Europe" issued extensive or
ders for mobilization. After calling
out several divisions of troops and
cancelling all leaves on Saturday,
Belgium called an additional 30,000
to 40,000 men to the colors yester
day, coincident with a report that
unofficial Italian sources had warned
the government of an imminent at
tack by the Germans.
Yesterday's order, then, which
placed the country on a footing
just short of general mobilization,
brought the number of men under
arms nearly to 700,000, of whom
some (55,000 were of first line rat
ing. The warning against pos
sible invasion by the Nazis was
said to have been delivered Friday
night and to have come from an
excellent, although unofficial,
source in high Italian circles. The
identity of the person delivering
the message, however, was not
disclosed. The fact that it came
from Italy indicates that the
growing feeling of distrust be
tween the Mussolini-men and the
Hitler-men may blossom into an
outright junking of the Rome-
Berlin axis. There's nothing like
a good betrayal to blast the roots
of a mutual-consultation alliance.

ITALY has been playing the per
centages, like a cautious gambler.
In World War I she hopped on the
winning bandwagon. And there is
no reason why she won't do it
again in World War 11.
The Italian crown princess is Bel
gian and other non-official Italian
circles were said to maintain close
contact with Belgian authorities. All
night long Belgian troop trains shut
tled soldiers back to their units.
Dispatch riders on motorcycles
dashed about, delivering military or
ders. An unusual number of planes
were in the air. Hundreds of in
habitants of villages in the frontier
districts of Eupen, St. With and Mal
medy had left their homes and gone
to the interior of the country. The
general staff took over the handling
of press service, a contact previously
handled by the ministry of defense.
* * *
At. the same time, preparations for
fighting were continuing in Hol
land. All military leaves were can
celled and all soldiers on periodical
leave were recalled to their posts.
A special session of the cabinet at
The Hague was summoned to dis
cuss the international situation. It
was understood that the German
troops had been given orders to be
prepared to move at any given mo
ment, and that their supply trains
were so regimented as to allow them
to continue and advance indefi
nitely.
With the freshening of activity
throughout, the Continent, Europe
could expect to awake this morning
with, perhaps, new and bitter war
fare on the Western Front's "win
ter wonderland."

unofficial Italian sources had warned
the government of an imminent at

Yesterday's order, then, which
placed the country on a footing
just short of general mobilization,
brought the number of men under
arms nearly to 700,000, of whom
some (55,000 were of first line rat
ing. The warning against pos
sible invasion by the Nazis was
said to have been delivered Friday
night and to have come from an
excellent, although unofficial,
source in high Italian circles. The
identity of the person delivering
the message, however, was not

from Italy indicates that the
growing feeling of distrust be

Hitler-men may blossom into an
outright junking of the Rome-
Berlin axis. There's nothing like
a good betrayal to blast the roots
of a mutual-consultation alliance.
