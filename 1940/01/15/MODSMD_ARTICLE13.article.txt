# Symphony Is Farm Soph's Bid for Fame

### BUD AMES 
Stanford sophomore makes good.
He's William Laurenee Bergsma, 18,
who back in 1938 had his 50-page
symphonic ballet, the "Paul Bun
yan" Suite, played over the National
Broadcasting Company.
"I always wanted to be a com
poser," Bill admitted very modestly.
"But I was fooling around compos
ing when I should have been prac
ticing on the piano. Then I took up
the violin. In my first attempt, I
tried to fake the phonograph melody
of "Ramona," which didn't turn out
so well."
VERSATILE MUSICIAN
Today Bill plays the piano, violin,
and viola—and very well, although
he denies it.
Bill lays a great deal of his sym
phonic success to Mr. Howard Han
sen, director of the Eastman School
of Music, from whom he took a
music composition course during a
Southern California summer session.
PLAYED 12 PAGES
"I played him parts of my unfin
ished 'Paul Bunyan'—only about 12
pages of piano orchestration —and he
told me to send him the completed
work later," Bill went on.
"Tlie piano score was completed in
December of 1937, and I sent him
the complete orchestration of about
50 pages in March of 1938. By that
time, I was tired of the thing."
SHOWS MANUSCRIPT
By way of explanation, Bill pro
duced the weighty manuscript. It
is as thick as a best-seller novel,
has close to a million and a half
notes, and contains written parts for
every instrument from a flute to a
tuba—and all from the long, thin
fingers of Bill Bergsma.
First public performance of the
completed "Paul Bunyan" took
place in 1938 at the Symposium of
American Music held at Rochester,
N.Y. The same evening the suite
was broadcast by N.B.C.
"There — I've got the recordings
made of that broadcast," Bill said,
moving to the phonograph. "I don't
know what happened, but. almost at
the end of the composition, an ex
planation of Hitler's Sudeten speech
| cut into the broadcast. Very
| strange."
He played the recording, and near
I the conclusion, suddenly the twang
| ing voice of Ted Husing interrupted
! the piece, shouting something about
Hitler. Bill just shook his head
i mournfully.
j Bill's great work will be played by
; the Oakland Symphony the evening
1 of Jan. 24. which, Bill sadly admits,
is the same evening as the Tibbett
| concert here on the Farm. It will be
! played later at Stockton and pus -
j sibly later by the Duluth Sym
-1 phony orchestra.
Bill's list of works doesn't end
there. He has composed a quintet
for piano and strings, "Aucassin e
Nicolette" (a chamber opera), a
woodwind quintet, a set of dances.
| "Work in Progress," and five pie-
I ludes for which he has won many
| prizes.
1 Bill isn't majoring in anything
here at Stanford, just taking inter
esting courses. Next year he is go
ing to the Eastman School of Music
to study and compose.
And he's only 18 today. And he
1 goes to Stanford.
