# Artist Donates Paintings to Club
## 
### 
China's most famous woman
painter, Miss Chang Kwan-ye, now
a special art student at Stanford,
was honored at a reception given
by the Stanford Chinese Student
Club last Friday afternoon at the
Chinese Clubhouse.
Miss Chang, whose entire group
of paintings is being exhibited at
the Stanford Art Gallery for the re
mainder of the month, donated sev
eral of her paintings to the Stanford
Chinese Club to help perpetuate
"culturally, as well as historically,
(he fine friendship between America
and China."
The importance of this is attested
by the fact that her works have re
ceived prizes and medals in Bel
gium. Paris, and Berlin. Miss Chang
has been invited by the Italian gov
ernment to exhibit at the Ilalian In
ternational Exposition in 1942.
