## Farm Political Group Based on Yale Plan; Barclay Is Adviser 
### HARRIET FISHER 
Now that war has made it necessary
In impose restrictions on the freedom
ol' speech of the peoples of Europe,
American institutions are the only
ones which can possibly practice the
traditions of democracy. That is ex
actly what the Stanford Political
Union is doing, for the purpose of
the union is to provide an open
forum where any student may ex
press freely his opinion on any pub
lic question.
The political union was born at
Oxford in the late '20's and from
there it soon spread to other univer
sities. In 1934, Yale University
started the first group in ihe United
States.
DEBATERS LIKE PLAN
During spring vacation of 1938,
Carl Diesenroth and Gerald Marcus,
Stanford varsity debaters, attended
a union meeting at Yale while on a
debate tour, and they liked the idea
so well they decided to organize a
union here. The Stanford Political
Union was formed in May of that
year.
Meetings of the political union are
modeled on the procedure in the
British Parliament's House of Com
mons. The members are grouped
into three parties: liberals, conserva
tives, and laborites, according to
their political sympathies.
EXECUTIVE PICKS TOPIC
The subject for debate is chosen
by the executive council meeting in
a private meeting and is presented
to the parties. Then each party holds
a pre-meeting caucus in which the
members decide on the stand which
they will take on the question.
At. the meeting, a member of each
party gives an introductory speech
in which he voices his party's stand
on the question. Then the question
is opened to general discussion in
the form of argument and rebuttal.
YALE METHOD
At Yale, it was the custom to have
an authority express his opinion,
either pro or con, on the subject
before the actual debate. This idea
was adopted at Stanford, then
dropped by debater Vincent Lem
mon when he was president of the
union in the fall of 1938.
Under the newly elected president,
Oliver Wyman, who was a member
of the Yale union when he was a
student there, the speaker plan is
bring revived. Professor Thomas S.
Barclay of the political science de
partment, who has been faculty ad
viser of the organization ever since
its founding, will speak at this year's
first meeting next Thursday evening.
The subject of the debate is
whether or not the Dies Committee
should continue its activity. Meet
ings this year will be concerned
mainly with issues which will come
up in connection with the presiden
tial election in November.

their political sympathies.
EXECUTIVE PICKS TOPIC
The subject for debate is chosen
by the executive council meeting in
a private meeting and is presented
to the parties. Then each party holds
a pre-meeting caucus in which the
members decide on the stand which
they will take on the question.
At. the meeting, a member of each
party gives an introductory speech
in which he voices his party's stand
on the question. Then the question
is opened to general discussion in
the form of argument and rebuttal.
YALE METHOD
At Yale, it was the custom to have
an authority express his opinion,
either pro or con, on the subject
before the actual debate. This idea
was adopted at Stanford, then
dropped by debater Vincent Lem
mon when he was president of the
union in the fall of 1938.
Under the newly elected president,
Oliver Wyman, who was a member
of the Yale union when he was a
student there, the speaker plan is
bring revived. Professor Thomas S.
Barclay of the political science de
partment, who has been faculty ad
viser of the organization ever since
its founding, will speak at this year's
first meeting next Thursday evening.
The subject of the debate is
whether or not the Dies Committee
should continue its activity. Meet
ings this year will be concerned
mainly with issues which will come
up in connection with the presiden
tial election in November.
Now that war has made it necessary
In impose restrictions on the freedom
ol' speech of the peoples of Europe,
American institutions are the only
ones which can possibly practice the
traditions of democracy. That is ex
actly what the Stanford Political
Union is doing, for the purpose of
the union is to provide an open
forum where any student may ex
press freely his opinion on any pub
lic question.
The political union was born at
Oxford in the late '20's and from
there it soon spread to other univer
sities. In 1934, Yale University
started the first group in ihe United
States.
DEBATERS LIKE PLAN
During spring vacation of 1938,
Carl Diesenroth and Gerald Marcus,
Stanford varsity debaters, attended
a union meeting at Yale while on a
debate tour, and they liked the idea
so well they decided to organize a
union here. The Stanford Political
Union was formed in May of that
year.
Meetings of the political union are
modeled on the procedure in the
British Parliament's House of Com
mons. The members are grouped
into three parties: liberals, conserva
tives, and laborites, according to
their political sympathies.
