# Holland, Belgium Tighten Defenses; Fear Onslaught Of Fuehrer's Blitzkrieg
## Nazi Position on Frontier Reported Unchanged; Belgians Call Over 30,000 Men; Dutch Cancel Army Leaves 
### United Press 
Rumors thai Germany soon might loose its long-threatened Blitzkrieg
on the Allies in a combined land and air attack through Belgium and the
Netherlands spread through Europe Sunday as those two small neutral
nations suddenly adopted important new defense measures.
Neutral observers and competent quarters in London and Paris, however,
pointed out that neither of the two governments had issued official explana-

tions for their new precautions and<
asserted that Germany was reported
by reliable sources not to have made
any serious changes in her military
position on the Belgian and Dutch
frontiers.
BELGIANS CALL SOLDIERS
Belgium took the last step short
of general mobilization by calling
up from 30,000 to 40,000 men be
tween the ages of 20 and 35 in cate
gory "D," the supply services. This
action reportedly resulted from in
formation from an Italian source that
Germany was contemplating a gen
eral attack through cither Belgium or
the Netherlands or both. Belgium's
military manpower now will total
about 700,000 men, of which 65,000
are believed to be of first-line cali
ber.
The Netherlands canceled all mili
tary leaves and recalled soldiers on
leave because of "symptoms of an
international character," according to
the only official statement issued by
the government. There were uncon
firmed reports that the Germans had
reinforced their mobile units and
that new equipment had been in
vented to enable German troops to
cross portions of the Netherlands
which the Dutch are prepared to in
undate by opening the dikes in
event of an invasion.
GOVERNMENT PRECAUTIONS'
Informed sources asserted that the
government merely had taken pre
cautionary measures and that there
was no real basis for rumors that
Germany was preparing to open a
new and intensified phase of the
war.
Coinciding with the Low Coun
tries' new measures was an an
nouncement by the British War Of
fice that all leaves for the British
Expeditionary Force in France had
been suspended temporarily.
In Berlin, authorized Nazi sources
declined to comment on the Low
Countries' action, which was given
only the briefest mention in the
German press.
HELSINKI BOMBED
Continued intensive aerial activity
marked the Russo-Finnish conflict.
Helsinki, the Finnish capital, was
the target of two Russian bombing
attacks Sunday in which 500-pound
projectiles were among those
dropped by Soviet raiders. Several
bombs struck in the vicinity of the
country cottage of H. F. Arthur
Schoenfeld, United States Minister,
and bomb fragments struck the
house.
One Soviet plane was shot down
by Finnish anti-aircraft guns pro
tecting the capital and another in
vader craft was brought down at
Rishimaki, the Finns claimed. Han
ko and Tamisaari were bombed five
times Sunday.
Reports reaching Svanvik, Nor
way, said 40 Russian planes had at
tacked in the vicinity of Petsamo,
Finland's Arctic port, but results of
the raid were not determined.
Eight bombers dropped about
nine bombs on the Swedish seaport
of Luleaa, according to Stockholm
reports. No one was killed or in
jured in the raid, it was said.

tions for their new precautions and<
asserted that Germany was reported
by reliable sources not to have made
any serious changes in her military
position on the Belgian and Dutch
frontiers.
BELGIANS CALL SOLDIERS
Belgium took the last step short
of general mobilization by calling
up from 30,000 to 40,000 men be
tween the ages of 20 and 35 in cate
gory "D," the supply services. This
action reportedly resulted from in
formation from an Italian source that
Germany was contemplating a gen
eral attack through cither Belgium or
the Netherlands or both. Belgium's
military manpower now will total
about 700,000 men, of which 65,000
are believed to be of first-line cali
ber.
The Netherlands canceled all mili
tary leaves and recalled soldiers on
leave because of "symptoms of an
international character," according to
the only official statement issued by
the government. There were uncon
firmed reports that the Germans had
reinforced their mobile units and
that new equipment had been in
vented to enable German troops to
cross portions of the Netherlands
which the Dutch are prepared to in
undate by opening the dikes in
event of an invasion.
GOVERNMENT PRECAUTIONS'
Informed sources asserted that the
government merely had taken pre
cautionary measures and that there
was no real basis for rumors that
Germany was preparing to open a
new and intensified phase of the
war.
Coinciding with the Low Coun
tries' new measures was an an
nouncement by the British War Of
fice that all leaves for the British
Expeditionary Force in France had
been suspended temporarily.
In Berlin, authorized Nazi sources
declined to comment on the Low
Countries' action, which was given
only the briefest mention in the
German press.
HELSINKI BOMBED
Continued intensive aerial activity
marked the Russo-Finnish conflict.
Helsinki, the Finnish capital, was
the target of two Russian bombing
attacks Sunday in which 500-pound
projectiles were among those
dropped by Soviet raiders. Several
bombs struck in the vicinity of the
country cottage of H. F. Arthur
Schoenfeld, United States Minister,
and bomb fragments struck the
house.
One Soviet plane was shot down
by Finnish anti-aircraft guns pro
tecting the capital and another in
vader craft was brought down at
Rishimaki, the Finns claimed. Han
ko and Tamisaari were bombed five
times Sunday.
Reports reaching Svanvik, Nor
way, said 40 Russian planes had at
tacked in the vicinity of Petsamo,
Finland's Arctic port, but results of
the raid were not determined.
Eight bombers dropped about
nine bombs on the Swedish seaport
of Luleaa, according to Stockholm
reports. No one was killed or in
jured in the raid, it was said.
Rumors thai Germany soon might loose its long-threatened Blitzkrieg
on the Allies in a combined land and air attack through Belgium and the
Netherlands spread through Europe Sunday as those two small neutral
nations suddenly adopted important new defense measures.
Neutral observers and competent quarters in London and Paris, however,
pointed out that neither of the two governments had issued official explana-

tions for their new precautions and<
asserted that Germany was reported
by reliable sources not to have made
any serious changes in her military
position on the Belgian and Dutch
