# Dana Stars as Freshman Five Scores Double Win
## 
### DON SELBY 
Led by Jack Dana, who tallied a total of .'!! points, the Stanford fresh
man basketball team copped a pair of victories over the week-end from
Salinas J. C. and George Washington High School.
In Friday night's contest Coach Beeb Lee's charges had a fairly easy
time of it. taking the game by a 13-33 count, but it was a different story

Saturday night when they eked out,
n 23-22 win over Lloyd Leith's very
tough George Washington outfit.
The George Washington game was
a nip-and-tuck affair from the open
ing whistle to the final gun, with
never more than 4 points separating
the two teams. Going into the last
part of the second half on the short
end of a 15-16 score, the frosh cag
ers turned on the heat enough to
run their total to 23 points as Dana,
Ross Meyer, Ed Voss, and then
Dana again popped field goals.
MAESTRI SCORES
In the meantime they held the
George Washington Eagles to two
field goals and two free throws. The
Eagles' last bucket came on Maestri's
two-hand shot just, as the gun end
ed, the abbreviated second half, leav
ing the score 23-22 in favor of
Stanford.
George Washington put on a much
better exhibition of basketball than
Salinas J. C. did on Friday night,
and if it hadn't been for Dana's
dead-eye basket shooting Leith's
gang might well have won the fray.
As it was they came much too close
to allow Coach 11. B. Lee to sit in
ease during the last few minutes of
play.
VOSS, STAMM STAR
Good defensive rebound work was
turned in by Voss and Ed Stamm
during the first half, but in the sec
ond canto the Eagles tallied several
times on lollow-shots as Maestri, a
very good player Saturday night,
barged in to take the ball off the
hackboard.
Fred Linari, although he scored
only two points, played some good
ball, as did Ross Meyer after he re
covered from a bloody nose.
