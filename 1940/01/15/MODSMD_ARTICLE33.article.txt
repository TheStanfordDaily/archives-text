# Uclans Bow to Superior Card Team
## Indians, Trojans Capture Early Lead in Conference; Cal Loses U.S.C. Series Nibs Price's Bears Come to Farm Next Week-end for Grudge Game With Victorious Stanford Capers 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Stanford and the University of Southern California today were posted
on top of the Pacific Coast Conference Southern Division basketball heap.
Down in the lower half of the bracket were U.C.L.A. and California, (he
teams the Indian* and the Trojans drubbed in douhleheaders over the

week-end.
The teams switch opponents next j
Friday night with the burly Bears j
treking to the Farm, while the U.S.C. ;
club tries to subdue the Bruins in ;
Los Angeles. Stanford tripped ]
U.C.L A. 53-38 and 40-36 in the ;
two-night stand in the Pavilion for ;
the Bruins' 27th and 28th straight
conference defeats.
BEARS IMPROVING
Cal finished a barnstorming tour !
with a clear-cut deficit, winning j
only three games in the East. The |
slow start didn't help them any |
against U.S.C. â€”especially since the j
Ti'ojans are favored to cop Cal's j
basketball crown this year.
However, the Bears showed re- j
markable improvement in the Fri- \
day and Saturday games down |
south, losing the first 49-36, and j
dropping the second, 56-49. Coach j
Everett Dean has a lot of respect for |
Nibs Price's five and expects the im- j
provement to continue through a i
couple of more games.
GAME A TOSS-UP
The chances of Stanford's cop- j
ping Friday's game are the best in ,
two years. Last year the Indians!
drubbed an over-confident Bear I
team in the third tilt. Now with the j
Dean system fairly well established ,
the Indians can be expected to be j
even choices in every Bear game I
this season.
What capacity crowds saw Friday ,
and Saturday nights were entirely .
different contests. The Indians had !
little trouble in downing the Bruins j
in the opener but had their diffi- j
culties in the second.
Although the Bruins, with the ex- !
ception of Jackie Robinson, couldn't :
hit their hats when it came to scor- !
ing, the Southerners found Stanford !
in the same boat. Their scrappy, j
rough and tumble play forced the j
Cards to make more shots from far I
out than the previous night.
FORWARDS STRONG
Williams scored 22 points the first j
night but was off his stride Satur- j
day, sinking but four baskets. How- j
ever, the team missed the floor play
of Fordy Anderson, the other for
ward, who started the game with a j
headache and left with a slight char- !
ley horse in his right leg. He got
back late in the second half to help
stave off the recurring Bruin of
fensive threats.
