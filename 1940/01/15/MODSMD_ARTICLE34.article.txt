### JERRY MAYER 
LETS TALK ABOUT
THE CAGE SPORT
At other schools up and down the
country — also, over and across —
sports columnists (as I laughingly
like to call myself) have been dis
cussing basketball for several weeks
now. And I have just discovered
that today will be the first time that
I have dwelled on the cage sport this
school year. Horrors!
Of course, it couldn't really be
avoided, what with the firing of
Tiny Thornhill and the hiring of
Clark Shaughnessy, plus student
polls, etc. All in all, basketball
just couldn't seem to edge into
Sideline Slants.
The moral is: If you want to write
about basketball, don't be sports ed
itor at a college that has losing
football teams that hog all the at
tention by getting new coaches.
REFLECTIONS ON
THE UCLA SERIES
The Bruins convinced me that
this year they are going to break
their atrociously long conference
losing streak, which has now
reached 28 straight. They may not
win more than one conference
game this year, but I have a hunch
that at least they will win that
many . . . Perhaps against Cali
fornia, whom they would rather
beat than anyone else.
Other thoughts . . . Stanford
had gone off the floor for a pre
game pep talk from Coach Everett
Dean. U.C'.L.A.'s starting five men
were warming up under the Bruin
basket. A hall got away from
Robinson and rolled to the other
end of the floor with the colored
boy in leisurely pursuit. The
young fellow who sells peanuts
and adorns himself in a derby hat
and tailcoat picked the hall lip,
but instead of throwing it to Rob
inson he took a shot at the basket,
making the negro chase it still
further. If I were Robinson, I
think I might have poked the be
derbied one.
While Robinson is a sweet of
fensive player, his defensive work
sometimes is pretty sloppy. Kenny
Davidson was constantly feinting
him out of position and dribbling
past him. When the Bruins started
their rally late in Saturday night's
game, the U.C.L.A. coach and play
ers kept imploring Robinson to
keep his arm upraised when he was
guarding Davidson. . . . On one
play, Robinson, due to the shouts
from his bench, had his arm raised
on Davidson to prevent him from
shooting. But when Kenny clev
erly faked a pass out, Jackie imme
diately dropped his arm. There
upon, the Stanfordite turned around
and dropped a long bucket. The
Bruins on the bench nearly cried.
Hal Dornsife, former U.S.C. guard,
whose chief claim to fame is that he
once held Luisetti to 7 points,
scouted the Indians for his alma
mater last week-end. Domsife is
now playing for the Olympic Club.
