//QEEING no need to approve or condemn the
O actions of the National Convention, [the
Stanford chapter of the American Student Un
ion | will continue to concentrate its efforts on
. . . domestic issues."
Thus, yesterday the local branch of the A.S.U.
found itself awkwardly attempting to back out
of the trap it set for itself at the end of the
quarter when its leaders stated that they were
considering joining the minority group which
planned to force a referendum of the now-noto
rious action of its national convention.
The delegates to this conference, held in Mad
ison, Wis., during the Christmas vacation, over
whelmingly refused to pass a resolution naming
Soviet Russia the aggressor in its conflict with
Finland.
When Stanford's A.S.U. heads stated that they
were thinking of refuting this action, they caused
considerable surprise on the campus. Could it
be that at last they were using their own brains
instead of pirating thoughts direct from Earl
Browder's pamphlets?
But no, this embryonic faith in the A.S.U. was
destined to die stillborn.
After striding boldly into the room with its
original announcement, yesterday the Stanford
chapter attempted to back out of the door with
out being noticed. But it moved so clumsily that
it nearly tripped over the threshold.
The fact that the Student Union attempted to
conceal its embarrassment by talking loudly
about domestic relations, how it was going to
keep America out of war and guard our civil
rights and fight against racial discrimination,
could not fool anyone, even its own members.
The unescapable truth is that the local mem
bers of the A.S.U. are as blindly loyal to the
ideals of Moscow as were the delegates to the
national convention. True, they did not go so
far as to vote in favor of the pro-Soviet resolu
tion, but the implications of their refusal even to
consider it are obvious.
It is amazing, in the light of all that has hap
pened in Europe since last September, that most
American leftists cannot bring themselves to the
realization that Russia has long forgotten the
lofty, humanitarian ideals of socialism, that it is
as hungry for money and power as any other
nation.
In declining to act on the national resolution,
the A.S.U. goes on record as at least not oppos
ing it. This would not be considered objection
able if it were not for the fact that the convention
condemned Germany as the aggressor in Po
land at the same time it refused to brand the
Soviet as the initiator of the Finnish struggle.
The case is simply one of hypocritical incon
sistency.
For one brief moment this quarter it looked
as if the Stanford chapter was going to show
the rest of the American Student Union that it
would not obediently fall in line with the rest
of the blind parade.
It had its opportunity this week-end. Instead
of grabbing the chance, it merely tightened the
ring in its nose.
