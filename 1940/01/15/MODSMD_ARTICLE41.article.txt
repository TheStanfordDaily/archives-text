STANFORD'S well-organized winter program
of intramural athletics, ideally offering max
imum opportunity for participation instead of
stressing mere spectatorship, starts today.
As is conventional with the winter months,
basketball will be the major sport of the cal
endar, with handball also included for the bene
fit of those who prefer "non-team" competition.
Intercollegiate football, basketball, and track
are intensely thrilling spectacles. The Cardinal
cage sguad has started off well on what looks
like a good season, winning their first two con
ference games on consecutive nights. But the 1
individual value to the spectator, beyond a j

healthy excitation of the adrenal glands, is lim
ited to psychic satisfaction. Pushing through a
Pavilion crowd, while calling for ingenuity,
could hardly be termed beneficial exercise.
But in the intramural sports program is offered
an opportunity to get plenty of strenuous exer
cise. And, best of all, the muscular work can
be done under enjoyable conditions, stimulated
by keen competition. The dull fog of study,
friendly personal grudges, excess of energy all
can be worked off on the basketball floor or the
handball court, with definite inter-club rating as
the prize.
The intramural sports program is organized
to offer the residents of every living group, the
members of every eating club, persons in aca
demic groups from the Chemistry Building to
Engineering Corner, in short every student on
campus, a chance to compete.
Based on this principle of the greatest benefit
for the greatest number, the intramural sports
schedule is the most universal, all-campus ac
tivity on the calendar every guarter. —J. B.
