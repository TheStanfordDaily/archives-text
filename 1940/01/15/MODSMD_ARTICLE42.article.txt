The propeller starts to roar like a squadron of basso
profundo motorcycles. It gets fast enough to look as
though it's spinning around in the direction which it
isn't, and then it becomes a transparent film, with a
diagonal streak of light where the sun hits it.
They take the red blocks from under the wheels,
and the four cylinders roar like fifty. We "taxi," onto
the asphalt stretch. A louder roar, and we gather
speed down the straightaway. It feels as though we
are going to broad jump, but we don't jar or hurtle.
The yellow wings just lift into the air, into nothing,
and there is a gentle tilt and rocking.
While we climb, we have the feeling that some
thing impossible and anti-common-sense is happen
ing. There is no dizziness or shaking or faltering.
But it still seems as though the steadiness should fail,
as though the plane should fall.
All the unbelievableness vanishes when we level
off at two thousand feet. The even keel and the seem
ingly lazy motion convince us that being islanded by
air is perfectly natural, perfectly safe. And then we
can look down with keener interest.

The world of earth looks thoroughly divorced from
the world of sky. All below is remote and absolutely
without practical significance to us. Because of its
lack of practical significance, and because it is aLI so
neat and trim, the whole world is distantly beautiful.
•Not only the smooth miles of lawn and the trees and
the lakes are beautiful. But the telephone poles too,
and the cows and roads and the mud are beautiful.
They are all calm and without flaw, like delicate
miniatures.
We are turning around now, and the strong-looking
wings slope in a steep bank. For the first time a mo
mentary little sensation of fear mixes with the general
exhilaration. We have been on an even keel for so
long that now the unnatural feeling returns. The
plane ought to slide to the ground. But leveling out
again, the bank seems securely exciting—in retrospect.
We wish the plane would bank again.
It does, and it gives us a conquering sensation. But
we are slowly gliding down. And it seems dream
soiling to leave the air-world, where the solid earth
could never touch us. It is like leaving an absorbing
play, and finding that you have been sitting next to
ordinary people in an ordinary world.
But one feels more compelte as he gets out of the
plane, and fresher.
For an emotional aeration, get acquainted with a
member of the Flying Club; they are nice people to
know.
