## MISS FIGGINS AND MR. SHAUGHNESSY 
### 
r riffi EDITOR, SIR:
Isn't it just so wonderful to be back at Stanford
again? My what a feeling—to get away from all the
evil living that one comes up against while on vaca
tion, and back to a spot where the words morality and
clean living are not mental figments but pure reality.
The very first thing I did when I arrived back was
to walk briskly down to the Quad, and do you know
what I did? I just couldn't help it! I threw back my
arms, heaved my bosom and just breathed in, almost
absorbed, the wonderful atmosphere that hangs about
these lovely spots. Have you ever done the same, the
masculine equivalent I mean, what ever that is?
Everything seemed excellent, or as Browning
said, 'All's right with the world.' And isn't that true?
With the clearing of the football situation and the com
pletion of rushing, nothing is amiss.
* # * *
I REALLY am so glad that Mr. (Whatshisname)
Shaughnessy is our next coach. It really opens
up such possibilities for Stanford and its football. He
is such a fine man, I just know that he will spend
no end of time with the intramural squads helping
them along, and isn't that something that the coach
always should have done?
From the attitude in the past one would think that
the game is the thing. Character building is what
should be emphasized, and I am firmly convinced
that Mr. Shaughnessy is without a doubt just the man
to do it. How can a place like that unmentionable,
side-tracked, seminary to the south ever hope to do
anything for the souls of its men who play for them?
Not a bit.; all they want to do is win, win, win all the
time. I just know that a winning squad will be of
the smallest importance to a fine man like our new
coach.
What is winning games? Nothing. And don't you
think that our Board and Mr. Shaughnessy aren't
aware of this. College is the place one comes for
development, mental as well as physical, and I am
confident that, a team that consistently wins cannot
help but acquire a smug self-satisfied attitude very
detrimental to not only themselves, but to the school.
* * * *
thing: are we so sure that football, in
tercollegiate I mean, is such a worth while thing?
Football is probably on its way out, and if this is the
case what better man is there to gracefully accom
plish this than Mr. Shaughnessy? He has had no end
of experience in this sort of transition, both at Loyola
and Chicago.
One of the most truly gratifying things that could
occur to this school, I am sure would be the reorgani
zation of the athletic emphasis and the increasing sig
nificance of intramural like archery and horse shoes
that could not help but result.
I therefore remain, ever for the pure athlete,
Confidently,

absorbed, the wonderful atmosphere that hangs about
these lovely spots. Have you ever done the same, the
masculine equivalent I mean, what ever that is?
Everything seemed excellent, or as Browning
said, 'All's right with the world.' And isn't that true?
With the clearing of the football situation and the com
pletion of rushing, nothing is amiss.

I REALLY am so glad that Mr. (Whatshisname)
Shaughnessy is our next coach. It really opens
up such possibilities for Stanford and its football. He
is such a fine man, I just know that he will spend
no end of time with the intramural squads helping
them along, and isn't that something that the coach
always should have done?
From the attitude in the past one would think that
the game is the thing. Character building is what
should be emphasized, and I am firmly convinced
that Mr. Shaughnessy is without a doubt just the man
to do it. How can a place like that unmentionable,
side-tracked, seminary to the south ever hope to do
anything for the souls of its men who play for them?
Not a bit.; all they want to do is win, win, win all the
time. I just know that a winning squad will be of
the smallest importance to a fine man like our new
coach.
What is winning games? Nothing. And don't you
think that our Board and Mr. Shaughnessy aren't
aware of this. College is the place one comes for
development, mental as well as physical, and I am
confident that, a team that consistently wins cannot
help but acquire a smug self-satisfied attitude very
detrimental to not only themselves, but to the school.

thing: are we so sure that football, in
tercollegiate I mean, is such a worth while thing?
Football is probably on its way out, and if this is the
case what better man is there to gracefully accom
plish this than Mr. Shaughnessy? He has had no end
of experience in this sort of transition, both at Loyola
and Chicago.
One of the most truly gratifying things that could
occur to this school, I am sure would be the reorgani
zation of the athletic emphasis and the increasing sig
nificance of intramural like archery and horse shoes
that could not help but result.
I therefore remain, ever for the pure athlete,
Confidently,

Isn't it just so wonderful to be back at Stanford
again? My what a feeling—to get away from all the
evil living that one comes up against while on vaca
tion, and back to a spot where the words morality and
clean living are not mental figments but pure reality.
The very first thing I did when I arrived back was
to walk briskly down to the Quad, and do you know
what I did? I just couldn't help it! I threw back my
arms, heaved my bosom and just breathed in, almost
absorbed, the wonderful atmosphere that hangs about
these lovely spots. Have you ever done the same, the
masculine equivalent I mean, what ever that is?
