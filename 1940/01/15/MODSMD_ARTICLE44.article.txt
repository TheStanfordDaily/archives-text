# Eddy Struts, Vocalizes For Fans in 'Balalaika'
## 
### 
"BALALAIKA," now playing at the Fox Stanford.
Press agents have said among other things of Nelson Eddy's latest
picture that it combines warm romance with glorious music. When they
stop there the description fits.
The romance is certainly warm enough and the music is uniformly
glorious, hut anybody looking for plot or dramatic performances won't

find them. Nelson Eddy swaggers"
through a loosely put-together tale
of Russian nobility before and after
1917 with his usual toothpaste-ad
expression and magnificent voice.
And for the millions of Americans
who count themselves Eddy fans
"Balalaika" is first-class entertain
ment.
Ilona Massey does the best job
of acting in the cast, and her voice
blends with Eddy's in song seqviences
that aie a credit to both. Particularly
during an impromptu snatch from
"Carmen" she reveals a talent and
personality that fans will demand
more of. And by the way, she's
beautiful.
Charlie Ruggles and Frank Morgan
supply the comedy in their usual
matchless style. Morgan is particu
larly well cast as the excitable op
era director and makes the audience
roar even at such lines as "Make it
9 o'clock—B:6o sharp."
For those who like Nelson Eddy,
"Balalaika" is passable entertain
ment. There is practically nothing
there for other than Eddy fans.
Other half of the bill is a cops and
robbers thriller called "Nick Carter,
Master Detective." During a cru
cial scene, the woman in the next
seat remarked, "Aren't detectives
dumb?" That just about covers it.
