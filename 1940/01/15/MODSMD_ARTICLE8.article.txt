# The
						Underpass Can't Kill This Tradition
## 
### 
ONE of the most hallowed—and certainly the
most practical—of Stanford traditions is
in danger of becoming extinct: the ride to Palo
Alto.
Hitching rides at the usual spot, opposite Eng
lish Corner, suffered a temporary set-back a
year or two ago when chains across the road
became a permanent feature of Lasuen Street.
Now the tradition again is on the verge of limbo.
Since the construction job on the new under
pass began, campus motorists have deserted
Palm Drive in favor of Galvez Street (the road
that goes past the 8.A.C.), which runs directly
into the Embarcadero, now the main artery for
traffic to and from Palo Alto.
The change has thrown a real hitch into the
lives of habitual hitch-hikers.
A few men have tried standing on the corner
of Galvez and Serra streets, by the Pavilion, and
have met with considerable success. But a reg
ular spot for rides to Paly has yet to be officially
established.
Since the entrance to University Avenue will
remain closed at least for the duration of the
school year, The Daily recommends the follow
ing procedures for hitching rides down to and
back from town.
To get a ridfe to Paly: assume an expectant
smile and stand at the northeast corner of Galvez

and Serra streets, by the Pavilion, across the
street from Encina's front lawn (and out of the
reach of water-bags).
More Palo Alto-bound traffic will pass this
point than any other near the center of the
campus. Both cars running down Galvez from
the Row and those coming from Serra Street
(in front of Memorial Hall) will be prospective
timber for transportation.
To obtain rides back to the campus: stand on
the northwest corner of University Avenue and
Emerson Street in front of the yellow-fronted
shoe store, across the street from the American
Trust Company Bank.
There is a bus-stop at this point where cars
can conveniently stop without holding up traf
fic. After picking up their passengers, drivers
can swing back into line, continue on University
Avenue for one block, and turn left on High
Street, which leads directly to the Embarcadero
and the old underpass.
If campus drivers will co-operate to the extent
of adopting these two stations for picking up
hitch-hikers, they will solve the transportation
problem for those students who are not for
tunate enough to own cars.
Certainly no one wants to see the death of
the "rides to Paly" tradition, the best available
evidence that Stanford men are men of good
will.
