### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
cannons may be moving up
to new western fronts. As these
typewriter keys print their legend
in black ink on white paper, a de
tachment of German troops may be
crossing the border of Holland or
Belgium. The world doesn't knowâ€”
at least not at this instant.
All through yesterday's tense
ness Europe's neutrals stood their
ground against the mounting
threat of war. While Germany
charged that the British are "in
citing" neutral fears, the Allied
powers took the view that a big
scale aerial offensive by the Nazis
might he in the offing.
Belgium, with King Leopold in
command and the armed defense
forces within a step of general mo
bilization, Holland, with army leaves
definitely canceleld. Sweden and
Norway both strongly warned by
Soviet Russia against miiltary aid to
Finland, were all staring the threat
of war in the face. Italy, in the pre
carious boot-heel of Europe, was
showing still further concern over
Red Army operations. Any Soviet
thrust toward the Balkans would
draw Raly into outright warfare. So
far, however, she can count on Rus
sia's new "Finnish live-year plan,"
taking ail the Soviets' attention.

real reason for the sudden
concern in the neutral states
was vague. On the surface there
appeared to be no more reason for
it than there was a similar wave
of worry due to the Allied charges
several weeks ago that the Nazis
were plotting to invade the low
countries. Yet, fear spread through
the Continent.
Leaves were suspended for an in
definite period in the British Expe
ditionary Force in France. Simi
larly, Belgium recalled all her troops
from leaves, called up new men and
turned all military operations over
to the general staff. And the Neth
erlands cancelled all army leaves.
It was a strange situation, built
upon rumor and counter-rumor.
And there was no strong peg of
fact upon which to bang any gov
ernment's action. Tilings bad
reached, last night, that stage
where governments were taking
precautions without the slightest
explanation.

AN ACE military expert of the
Paris newspaper Petit Parisien
usserted that Holland and Belgium
had been apprehensive since Friday
over a rumor that Germany might
strike for the western front through
their territory next Saturday. Still
another unconfirmed report held
that Switzerland's army command
denied "foreign reports" that Ger
man troops had been concentrated
on the Swiss frontier. And Brussels'
supposedly informed "Italian sourc
es" continued to warn of an im
pending Nazi attack.
British newspaper correspondents,
telephoning news from Holland to
their offices in London, reported that
their conversations were repeatedly
interrupted by loud buzzing of the
line whenever they mentioned as
serted German troop concentration
on the Netherlands' southeastern
frontier.

The strange tiling was that there
seemed no real evidence of any
nature that could establish the
fact thai a German attack was
planned. In London, the concen
sus held that there was no real
threat of an early German thrust.
It is all propaganda, the British
think.
Still the unconfirmed reports
rolled in that, actually, Germany
was concentrating additional troops
on Holland's southeastern frontier,
including mobile units capable of
quick movement. In the next few
hours the mysterious quickening of
lempo in World War II may blossom
into actual fighting. Or it may be
just another incident in a long suc
cession of false stories and garbled
threats -another steel-ribbed joke.
