DISCUSSES PUBLIC APATHY
In discussing the Pacific Coast la

| rum last Wednesday, Mr. Sokolsky
I placed a large part of the blame
j upon the apathy of the American
I voting public.
"The people who talk about
j Bridges are largely responsible for
! his power. Thoy upbraid him and
then vote into high offices those who
endow Bridges with authority," he
accused.
Mr. Sokolsky also attacked labor
itself when he said, "Unfortunately,
labor is thrusting us toward the
brink of national disaster, that same
disaster that has overtaken the rest
of the world."
Mr. Sokolsky expressed his be

lief that the American capitalistic
system is the only natural and nor
mal form of government.
In Petrograd to observe the Rus
sian Revolution at first hand, Mr.
Sokolsky gained a wide understand
ing of the conditions. He edited the
"Russian Daily News," the only
English paper in (he Russian capital.
Asked to leave Russia because of
his political views, Mr. Sokolsky
went to China. While there he edited
various American newspapers pub
lished in China and acted as politi
cal correspondent for American and
English publications.

Mr. Sokolsky was awarded Co
lumbia University's medal for "Dis
tinction in Public Service" in 1938.
In defining his position Mr. Sokol
sky says, "I am a conservative in the
major ways of life, a capitalist in
my economic thinking, and a rigid
constitutionalist in my political
thinking. More than anything else,
I fear the concentration of power in
the hands of any one individual in
government.
