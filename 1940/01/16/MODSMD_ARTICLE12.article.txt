"A rag, a bone and a hank of hair"
may have been Kipling's definition
of a woman; with the addition of a
few more materials he would have
had a mobile.
Stanford has a mobile. A mobile
is considered the "latest thing" in
modern sculpture, and may be de
fined technically as "a moving three
dimensional abstraction which is an
| other form of expression of sculp
ture as opposed to forms of static
sculpture," according to Mr. Philip
Joseph of the graphic arts depart
ment.
To put it in plainer English, a
mobile is a composition of balanced
objects which will move when dis
turbed by a current of air or other
I stimulus.
Enid Kuchel and Miles Swanson,
two Stanford graduate art students,
constructed the mobile as an experi
ment. Their inspiration was the
mobile by Calder, the English sculp
! toi, which was on exhibition at the
j San Francisco Fair last year. Their
| materials were: some tin roofing, a
copper coil, string, a notched black
1 wood rod. a wooden darning egg, a
j fur-covered block, a blue glass disc,
and a brass rod. Balance them all
togethei and suspend them from a
redwood frame and you get the ob-
I ject pictured here.
