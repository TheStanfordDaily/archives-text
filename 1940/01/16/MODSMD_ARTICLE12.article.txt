# MODERN ART STUDENTS CREATE MOBILE
## Local Esthetes On Ears Over Moving Statue 
### MARY JUDSON 
"A rag, a bone and a hank of hair"
may have been Kipling's definition
of a woman; with the addition of a
few more materials he would have
had a mobile.
Stanford has a mobile. A mobile
is considered the "latest thing" in
modern sculpture, and may be de
fined technically as "a moving three
dimensional abstraction which is an
| other form of expression of sculp
ture as opposed to forms of static
sculpture," according to Mr. Philip
Joseph of the graphic arts depart
ment.
To put it in plainer English, a
mobile is a composition of balanced
objects which will move when dis
turbed by a current of air or other
I stimulus.
Enid Kuchel and Miles Swanson,
two Stanford graduate art students,
constructed the mobile as an experi
ment. Their inspiration was the
mobile by Calder, the English sculp
! toi, which was on exhibition at the
j San Francisco Fair last year. Their
| materials were: some tin roofing, a
copper coil, string, a notched black
1 wood rod. a wooden darning egg, a
j fur-covered block, a blue glass disc,
and a brass rod. Balance them all
togethei and suspend them from a
redwood frame and you get the ob-
I ject pictured here.


ENID KUCHEL AND lIEK MOBILE
It took Miss Kuchel and Swanson
1 about 20 hours last quarter's finals
i
j week to put the mobile together,
j "Most of the time was spent in run
ning around looking for the mate
rials," said Miss Kuchel. "We had an
j awful time getting a darning egg
; without a handle. You've no idea
| how few people use them now
adays."
MADE IN SECRECY
Made under the greatest secrecy,
the mobile proved a fascinating ob
ject of curiosity to others of the art
department. Repeated attempts
I were made by other students to get
i to the studio on the top floor of the
old Women's Gym, where the con
struction took place. Once the
workers were locked up in the stu
dio, with threats not to let them
out until they showed the mobile.
Another more daring attempt was
| made when a football player boost
! Ed a woman up over the roof out-
I side to try to spy on it. But the
j mobile was successfully kept secret
until the unveiling. It will be placed
on display in the art department
soon.
Although started as an experi
ment. mobiles are intended for home

use. They are supposed to prove a
satisfactory "objet d'art" for the par
lor, since the objects in this system
of physical balances move in rela
tion to one another to form patterns
and different shadow effects. "This
ought to carry out the theory that
physical balance will bring aesthetic
balance," said Mr. Joseph.
Since there was no final in the
Architectural Design course, Mi.ss
Kuchel and Swanson undertook to
make the mobile as an interesting
experiment, basing their construction
on the fact that it takes a small
object of greater density to balance
an object of lesser density.
They got an A in the course.

Enid Kuchel and Miles Swanson,
two Stanford graduate art students,
constructed the mobile as an experi
ment. Their inspiration was the
mobile by Calder, the English sculp
! toi, which was on exhibition at the
j San Francisco Fair last year. Their
| materials were: some tin roofing, a
copper coil, string, a notched black
1 wood rod. a wooden darning egg, a
j fur-covered block, a blue glass disc,
and a brass rod. Balance them all
togethei and suspend them from a
redwood frame and you get the ob-
I ject pictured here.


ENID KUCHEL AND lIEK MOBILE
It took Miss Kuchel and Swanson
1 about 20 hours last quarter's finals
i
j week to put the mobile together,
j "Most of the time was spent in run
ning around looking for the mate
rials," said Miss Kuchel. "We had an
j awful time getting a darning egg
; without a handle. You've no idea
| how few people use them now
adays."
MADE IN SECRECY
Made under the greatest secrecy,
the mobile proved a fascinating ob
ject of curiosity to others of the art
department. Repeated attempts
I were made by other students to get
i to the studio on the top floor of the
old Women's Gym, where the con
struction took place. Once the
workers were locked up in the stu
dio, with threats not to let them
out until they showed the mobile.
Another more daring attempt was
| made when a football player boost
! Ed a woman up over the roof out-
I side to try to spy on it. But the
j mobile was successfully kept secret
until the unveiling. It will be placed
on display in the art department
soon.
Although started as an experi
ment. mobiles are intended for home

use. They are supposed to prove a
satisfactory "objet d'art" for the par
lor, since the objects in this system
of physical balances move in rela
tion to one another to form patterns
and different shadow effects. "This
ought to carry out the theory that
physical balance will bring aesthetic
balance," said Mr. Joseph.
Since there was no final in the
Architectural Design course, Mi.ss
Kuchel and Swanson undertook to
make the mobile as an interesting
experiment, basing their construction
on the fact that it takes a small
object of greater density to balance
an object of lesser density.
They got an A in the course.
"A rag, a bone and a hank of hair"
may have been Kipling's definition
of a woman; with the addition of a
few more materials he would have
had a mobile.
Stanford has a mobile. A mobile
is considered the "latest thing" in
modern sculpture, and may be de
fined technically as "a moving three
dimensional abstraction which is an
| other form of expression of sculp
ture as opposed to forms of static
sculpture," according to Mr. Philip
Joseph of the graphic arts depart
ment.
To put it in plainer English, a
mobile is a composition of balanced
objects which will move when dis
turbed by a current of air or other
I stimulus.
