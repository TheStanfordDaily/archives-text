Europe's "war of nerves" reached out to embrace wider territory Mon
day night following Sunday's hurried defense precautions l»y Belgium and
the Netherlands because of rumors that some surprise German move in
volving the lowland countries might he imminent.
The French Foreign Oflicc warned of possible simultaneous action by
Germany and Russia against neutral nations in Western and Eastern

and promised the "formidable
| support" of Britain and France to
any neutral attacked by the Ger
mans. The British government was
reported to have advised both Swe-
I den and Norway that Britain will
1 assist them if their independence i.s
threatened.
All leaves of the British Royal Air
Force in France were canceled in
definitely, only 24 hours after an
nouncement of a similar order af
fecting 250,000 British troops on the
j western front, in a move described
! by the British as "calling the Ger
man bluff" regarding a poiwible sur-
I prise blow.
| SEND PROTEST
Russian bombing planes swarmed
| upon southern Finland from their
j Estonian bases Monday and, for the
I fourth consecutive day, carried out
what Finnish officials alleged to be
a methodical wave of terror against
women and children, hospitals and
workers' districts. At least 18 per
sons, including women and chil
dren, were reported killed and 9IJ
wounded.
Norway and Sweden sent protests
to Moscow against the alleged
bombing and violations of their ter
j ritory by Russian warplanes engaged
jin the invasion of Finland. The
j protests coincided with disclosure
that they have informed Russia that
i they intend to permit continued
I shipments of supplies and volunteers
| to Finland across their borders,
j The Dutch cabinet was informed
| that the tension along the eastern
I frontier had eased greatly during the
past 24 hours but that the cancella
tion of all army leaves would remain
in effect for the time being being
because "watchfulness is essential
to maintain our neutrality."
GUARI) BUILDINGS
Military guards with fixed bayo
j nets stood guard at public buildings,
] railroads and bridges in Belgium
I after additional troops had been
| called up to increase Belgium's
, armed forces to 700,000 men over
j whom King Leopold assumed su-
I preme command. Although tension
eased, the emergency precautions
I taken by Belgium to guard her in
| dependence and neutrality did not.
Germany accused Great Britain
| and France of purposely inciting
unfounded "invasion scares" in IIol
: land, Belgium, Norway and Sweden
| in an effort to spread the European
war and provide the Allies with new
bases for operations against the
Reich.
Great Britain answered the pro
test of the 21 American republics
against violation of their "neutrality
belt" with the statement that Britain
"must reserve full belligerent rights"
in those waters because the Pan
j American scheme cannot bo effec
tively enforced. The British reply
| avoided making an outright rejec
j tion and said that Britain is anxious
j for fulfillment of the American neu
trality hopes.
Meantime, the United States has
rejected a British protest that th»>
American neutrality law discrimi-
I nates against British ships. The pro
| test was said to have been based on
1 the provision requiring transfer of
! title on all materials shipped aboard
j British vessels before the shipment
I takes place, even though the ship
ment Is designed for ports outside
I combat zones.
