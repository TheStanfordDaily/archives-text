# Ky Ebright To Address Rowing Club
## Cal Mentor to Show Crew Films Tonight For Stanford Fans 
### 
Farm rowing enthusiasts will meet
the country's ranking crew coach
tonight when Ky Ebright, Univer
sity of California rowing mentor,
shows the newly organized Stanford
Boat Club rowing movies at 7:45
o'clock in room 214 of the History
Building.
Ebright plans to bring several
reels of film, including one which
shows a sample day in the life of a
crew man.
After the movies, temporary Presi
dent Carl Gerlach will call the sec
ond meeting of the club to iron out
the problem of raising funds for the
construction of a training scow. This
issue will determine when rowing
will actually start.
ROWING DELAYED
Theoretically, the Boat Club has
completed temporary arrangements
so that a crew could be put on the
water tomorrow, but it would not
be practical to start rowing until the
training barge is built.
The club's finance committee has
drawn up a budget that will be pre
sented at the meeting. This budget
is considerably under the original
estimate.
Definite and official permission to
row in the Redwood City Harbor
has been granted to representatives
of the club by the Port Commis
sioner.
TO ELECT OFFICERS
Also on the program will be the
election of regular club officers.
Gerlach has been serving as acting
president since the first meeting was
held a week ago.
Ted Cole and Lee Peake received
an enthusiastic response yesterday
when they attended a luncheon of
the San Francisco Alumni Club to
explain the Boat Club's plans.
ALUMNI ENTHUSIASTIC
While there they met Rix Maurer,
who stroked the 1915 Stanford crew
at Poughkeepsie. Maurer said that
rowing facilities are far better now
than they were when he rowed.
"Tlie Stanford crew," he said, "even
at the height of its success, was run
on a small scale similar to that you
propose."
Jack Yates, rowing coach, said
that any additional recruits who
were not present at the first meeting
should try and attend tonight.
