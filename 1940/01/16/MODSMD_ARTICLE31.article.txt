### JERRY MAYER 
Last week Life magazine came out
wilh the picture of Ralph Vaughn,
U.S.C.'s ace basketball forward,
splattered all over the cover.
Inside the magazine was a two
page spread in which readers were
informed that Vaughn is the na
tion's best basketball player. Life
also showed by a series of pictures
how the Trojan eager works bis
favorite fake.
For Vaughn's sake, I hope that
the same jinx doesn't overtake him
that has caught up with several
football players and coaches after
magazines had exploited them.
Several years ago when U.S.C.
was in the dumps and the alumni
wolves were hollering for Howard
Jones' scalp, the Trojan coach was
writing daily articles for a Loj; An
geles newspaper. It is significant
that since Jones hcis discontinued his
literary efforts the Trojans have
gone to the Rose Bowl two suc
cessive years.
Another national magazine had
an article about colorful "Slip"
Madigan, St. Mary's mentor. The
Gaels won their first two games,
and then finished the rest of the
season without a victory.
Paul Christman, Missouri's All-
American halfback, and Major Rob
ert Neyland, coach of Tennessee's
Rose Bowl eleven, were fortunate in
that it wasn't until the season was
nearly over that national magazines
published articles concerning them.
But the hex was still working.
Neyland's team took a tremendous
trouncing in the Tournament of
Roses game, while Christman was
stopped dead in Missouri's New
Year's D;iy game with Georgia Tech.

Just recently, a western magazine
came out with a story concerning
California's basketball team, and
how Coach Nibs Price had another
powerhouse on his hands. Maybe it
was just to spite the periodical, but
the Bears took some terrible trounc
ings on their eastern barnstorming
tour, and then opened their confer
ence schedule by dropping two
games to U.S.C.
So all things point to the jinx
attaching itself to Vaughn this
season. Only maybe it won't.
Because Vaughn scored 20 points
in the first game against the Bears
and 19 the following night. I doubt
very much whether you could prove
he's being jinxed off that record.
