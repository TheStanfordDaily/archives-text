# Vaughan, Trojan Forward, Leads Division Scorers; Indians Prep for Bears
## Williams in Third Place as Cards Place Three in fop Fen; Varsity Works Against Cal Offense Today 
### 
Off to a sizzling start toward recapturing the Southern Division's indi
vidual scoring tit It*. Ralph Vaughan of Southern California today was
credited with leading (he conference with 39 points, all scored against
California defending tit lists.
Thirea.'ening in second and third positions are Jackie Robinson, U.C.L.A.
Negro flash who has 35 points, and Stanford's Don Williams with an even

30. Bill Ogilvie of the Bears, last,
year's runner-up to Vaughan, was
held by the Trojans' ace guard, Tom
McGarvin, to a sixth place position
of 22 points. Davidson of Stanford
and Bickerton of Cal are fourth
with 23 points.
TROJANS HIGH SCORERS
Vaughan is already 23 points ahead
of his 1939 mark, and last year in
Stanford he supposedly had an eas
ier team to meet in the conference
opener. His dwn individual scoring
mark is 180 points, while as runner
up to Hank Luisetti as a sophomore,
the sharpshooting forward rang up
174 points. The Trojans ;ire the high
scoring team to date with 105 points
scored against the Bears, whom the
Indians meet Friday night in the
Pavilion.
Preparing for the Bear invasion,
Coach Everett Dean gave his third
stringers Cal assignments yesterday
in practice and for the next several
days the Indians' first and second
strings will work against them.
INDIANS EVEN VS. CAL
Despite the fact that Nibs Price's
basketball giants were whipped in
Los Angeles, the quintet showed
such improvement that come game
time it is doubtful if our Indians will
be more than even choices to take
the first trick from Cal. Stanford's
Eastern record is way and above
superior to the Bears', but in these
series past performances mean little
as witness the difficulty Luisetti and
company had in dismissing the Bears
in 1938.

up to Hank Luisetti as a sophomore,
the sharpshooting forward rang up
174 points. The Trojans ;ire the high
scoring team to date with 105 points
scored against the Bears, whom the
Indians meet Friday night in the
Pavilion.
Preparing for the Bear invasion,
Coach Everett Dean gave his third
stringers Cal assignments yesterday
in practice and for the next several
days the Indians' first and second
strings will work against them.
INDIANS EVEN VS. CAL
Despite the fact that Nibs Price's
basketball giants were whipped in
Los Angeles, the quintet showed
such improvement that come game
time it is doubtful if our Indians will
be more than even choices to take
the first trick from Cal. Stanford's
Eastern record is way and above
superior to the Bears', but in these
series past performances mean little
as witness the difficulty Luisetti and
company had in dismissing the Bears
in 1938.
