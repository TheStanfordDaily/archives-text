# Frosh Cagers To Face Menlo
## Basketballer Meet Paly High Saturday 
### 
With two more victories chalked
up on the black-ink side of their
ledger as a result of last week-end's
contests against Salinas. J. C. and
George Washington High School,
j Stanford's undefeated freshman cag
i ers get down to work today to pre
pare for a pair of battles with Menlo
Junior College and Palo Alto High
School this Friday and Saturday
I nights, respectively.
Although quite satisfied with Fri
day night's performance, Coach H.
j B. Lee thought, that his team was
I way off the track on Saturday
night against George Washington
r High, when they made lots of out
| standing mistakes.
This week Lee will give the frosh
I a good deal of work on a new of-
J tensive variation, which is styled
I especially for Menlo J. C. because
Hoy Hughes, Menlo mentor, has
the Stanford style of play so well
scouted. Then, too, the Cal game
is only a few weeks off, and a new
offense might come in handy against
the Stanford frosh's arch-rivals
from Berkeley.
The Papoose squad showed quite
I a hit of improvement last week
end over early-season play, but if
they want a victory over Menlo J. C.
they will have to do even better,
according to Beeb Lee. For Menlo
is supposed to have one of the best
teams in the northern California
junior college loop thus season.
