# Smoke Signals

### 
STANFORD men and women smoke on the
Quad.
There is no use denying what is obviously a
fact. The wind does not carry those cigarette
butts into the Inner Quadrangle.
True, tradition dictates that there will be no
smoking under the arches and in the courts, but
uncontestable evidence proves that a great
many people have forgotten this custom.
Not only does it make an extremely unfavor
able impression on visitors when they see the
Quad littered with the remains of cigarettes,
but it also strikes a sour note with alumni who
took pride in living up to the code when they
were in school.
Stanford always has believed in respect,
never in homage for its founders. When Mrs.
Stanford requested that students do not smoke
on the Quad, the University issued no edict on
the subject. The no smoking tradition merely
became a gentlemen's agreement.
Today, as far as some people are concerned,
that agreement no longer exists.
Stanford's traditions have grown up as ex
pressions of the popular will. Unlike those of
certain other universities, they never have been
mere disguises for University rules or student
hypocrisies.
Such a code becomes less than worthless if
its words have no real meaning for the student
body. Dissembling and double-dealing have no
proper place in matters of this kind.
Either Stanford students do not smoke on the
Quad, or they do.
And if they do, there is no point in trying to
hide the fact by shutting our eyes and pointing
to a tradition.
If it is worth dropping, Stanford should
drop it.
