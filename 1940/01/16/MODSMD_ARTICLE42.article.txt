YES, it was colder when you got out of bed
this morning. And tomorrow morning, if
you get up three hours early, it's an even
chance that you can get in a good hour's ice
skating on Lake Lagunita.
But this cold weather, in spite of all the dis
comfort which comes with it, has one great
advantage. It has settled precisely what Stan
ford is.
Stanford is not the Harvard of the West, nor
the Yale of the West, as a few rabid Eli propa
gandists have been claiming. It is the Wiscon
sin of the West. By next winter skiing will be
an intramural sport.
Even so, you can't get around the fact that this
winter is tough on a lot of people. Think of
the men and women sleeping on sleeping
porches, and of off-campus residents who can't
get their cars started two minutes before 8
o'clock, and of those who come in on bicycles.
But think particularly of the frosh living in
Encina. It must have been a lot warmer around
here 40 years ago when Encina was built. It
was built strictly on the refrigerator principle.
There is, however, one group of men on the
campus definitely glad to see this cold weather:
Gordy Davis and his crew of campus policemen.
Since last year, it has been part of their job to
keep Stanford men and women from parking
on the campus at night unless they parked in
clustered groups around one of the women's
residences.
But in this weather, no one would think of
parking any place, even in a clustered group.
Not, that is, unless they all got into the same
car. And, as Interfraternity Council ruled last
quarter, two's a company, eight's a group.â€”D. J.
