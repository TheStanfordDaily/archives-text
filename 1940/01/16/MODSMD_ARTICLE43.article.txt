JUDGING from a letter in today's Campus
Opinion column, certain members of the
A.S.U. do not seem to comprehend the signifi
cance of The Daily's stand on their refusal to
condemn the pro-Russian action of their na
tional convention.
Having adopted a definite and unmistakable
policy against the United States becoming in
volved in the European war, The Daily does not
advocate any American group's taking sides in
the conflict. That is one of the quickest and
most convenient ways of getting this country
into it.
The A.S.U. cannot be blamed because it did
not take a stand against Soviet Russia at its
convention. But it does stand wide open to
attack on the score that it did condemn the
aggressions of Nazi Germany at the same time.
Certainly nothing could be more stupid or
hypocritical than to score publicly one nation
and to refuse to blame the other.

There was no more occasion to brand Russia
an aggressor than there was to brand Germany.
The A.S.U. should have kept its nose out of the
entire affair.
However, when the national convention was
foolish enough to sentence one country and not
the other, it really stuck its neck out. The local
chapter should have taken advantage of its op
portunity to remove itself from this ridiculous
position.
But it did not see fit to do so.
The Daily is not arguing for condemnation
of Russia. It is campaigning for the condemna
tion of no country.
