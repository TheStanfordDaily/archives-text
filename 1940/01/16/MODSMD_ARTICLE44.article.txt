### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
OUR LITTLE WET BLANKET
ITOW anyone so lovable as that dear, dear Hortense
Figgins can be quite so antagonistic is more
mystifying than Dick Tracy. To coin a phrase, that
Figgins girl represents all that is undesirable in our
community.
Yesterday she described for us the glory of filling
her feminine lungs with Stanford air again. But no
sooner does she take a breath of Farm atmosphere
than she begins her customary blatting. This time she
joins those whispering philosophers who think that
Coach Shaughnessy has been hired to ease football out
of the Stanford picture, and to emphasize only our
spirited program of intramural sports. In fact, this
fluffy Miss Figgins thinks that getting rid of football
would be a fine thing.
Now before we make Clark Shaughnessy the In
tramural Manager and Hortense the official Stanford
fortune-teller, we might remember that Shaughnessy
had a secure, pension-promised position at Chicago,
where he was well-paid for doing what Andy Stojko
vich does at Stanford—organizing intramural sports.
It's pretty hard to think of two good reasons for
Shaughnessy to have come to Stanford if he had not
planned on again becoming a football coach. It's de
lightfully sunny out here on the coast—true. But
Shaughnessy seems to be a pretty rugged chap, not
one who would migrate twenty-five hundred miles
like a sparrow just because of the weather.
* * * *
]Y|R. SHAUGHNESSY, Miss Figgins declares with a
flourish of her snow-white hand, has had a good
deal of experience in eliminating football—at. Loyola
and Chicago. That, in its own Figginsy way, is like
saying that becausc a football moves every time Frankie
Albert punts we can make his leg go through the
proper motions by moving a football. Shaughnessy
had to move (or wanted to) every time football was
abolished where he coached, but that doesn't mean
that by moving Shaughnessy football will again be
eliminated. *
The fact is that most of us would enjoy life more
if there were less self-ordained prophets predicting
that football will be replaced by intramural sports or
quoits. Everyone, with the possible exception of that
chronic pain-christened Hortense Figgins, wanted a
new coach and a new spirit. Well, Shaughnessy can't
win the Rose Bowl game for us in mid-April. He
can't prove that he isn't really a secret service man
hired to nab all football players before he even
crosses the Rockies. But he can be a good coach when
he gets here—if the student body lets him.
Let's not give him any more to contend with than
a disorganized team and Hortense Figgins.

joins those whispering philosophers who think that
Coach Shaughnessy has been hired to ease football out
of the Stanford picture, and to emphasize only our
spirited program of intramural sports. In fact, this
fluffy Miss Figgins thinks that getting rid of football
would be a fine thing.
Now before we make Clark Shaughnessy the In
tramural Manager and Hortense the official Stanford
fortune-teller, we might remember that Shaughnessy
had a secure, pension-promised position at Chicago,
where he was well-paid for doing what Andy Stojko
vich does at Stanford—organizing intramural sports.
It's pretty hard to think of two good reasons for
Shaughnessy to have come to Stanford if he had not
planned on again becoming a football coach. It's de
lightfully sunny out here on the coast—true. But
Shaughnessy seems to be a pretty rugged chap, not
one who would migrate twenty-five hundred miles
like a sparrow just because of the weather.

]Y|R. SHAUGHNESSY, Miss Figgins declares with a
flourish of her snow-white hand, has had a good
deal of experience in eliminating football—at. Loyola
and Chicago. That, in its own Figginsy way, is like
saying that becausc a football moves every time Frankie
Albert punts we can make his leg go through the
proper motions by moving a football. Shaughnessy
had to move (or wanted to) every time football was
abolished where he coached, but that doesn't mean
that by moving Shaughnessy football will again be
eliminated. *
The fact is that most of us would enjoy life more
if there were less self-ordained prophets predicting
that football will be replaced by intramural sports or
quoits. Everyone, with the possible exception of that
chronic pain-christened Hortense Figgins, wanted a
new coach and a new spirit. Well, Shaughnessy can't
win the Rose Bowl game for us in mid-April. He
can't prove that he isn't really a secret service man
hired to nab all football players before he even
crosses the Rockies. But he can be a good coach when
he gets here—if the student body lets him.
Let's not give him any more to contend with than
a disorganized team and Hortense Figgins.
OUR LITTLE WET BLANKET
ITOW anyone so lovable as that dear, dear Hortense
Figgins can be quite so antagonistic is more
mystifying than Dick Tracy. To coin a phrase, that
Figgins girl represents all that is undesirable in our
community.
Yesterday she described for us the glory of filling
her feminine lungs with Stanford air again. But no
sooner does she take a breath of Farm atmosphere
than she begins her customary blatting. This time she
