## GASTRITIS ON THE COMMONS 
### 
r pilE EDITOR, SIR:
It, is high time the Administration investigated
the Encina food situation. Never of very high quality,
the food served last Saturday night was a positive
indication that something was figuratively and lit
erally rotten in Denmark.
When a goodly portion of Eneinamen, hashers, and
eating club members complain of diarrhea and worse
after a single meal, the strain upon mere coincidence
becomes a little too strong.
When all of us pay $70 or $80 a quarter to eat meals
provided by the Commons, one would certainly think
that we would get adequate quality to correspond with
those figures.
Roble isn't the only one that can have a rebellion,
and those of us not freshmen would far rather eat in
Palo Alto than be slowly poisoned by tainted food.
