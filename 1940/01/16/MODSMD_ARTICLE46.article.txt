# THE 						BREEZES BLOW

r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
It must be due to lack of facts and not personal
dislike for the A.S.U. or its members that, the campus
is being misled in regard to the A.S.U. First, the
statement released yesterday was passed unanimously
—both by the membership and the Executive Com
mittee of the A.S.U. So worry no more because "no
hint was given whether the membership would take
sides." Second, since past presidents of the A.S.U. still
in school are extended the courtesy of being on the
Executive Committee, I might say: "I was there. I saw
it happen!" But the statement was released by the
Executive Committee, not me. This is immaterial, but
student papers should be careful of sloppy reporting.
Feeling that graduate students should be here for
serious study and that motivation and activation should
come from the undergraduates in student organiza
tions, I have tried to assume no responsibility in the
present "squabble" between the A.S.U. and the Daily
—sitting by while unsubstantiated "rumors" and state
ments by non-existent "minority leaders" were printed
as facts. But since the responsibility for yesterday's
statement was inaccurately attributed to me, perhaps
you will allow a few comments in return.

all-important concern facing America today IS
how we can stay out of war, how we can preserve
those democratic civil liberties guaranteed under the
constitution, not the fact of whether Russia is ag
gressing on Finland. Certainly much of the red-baiting
today »is using tlie latter as a cover for depriving
these same civil liberties we all believe in. Your edi
torial passed over very lightly, even ridiculed, these
constructive items of the A.S.U. program. Can you
deny that they are more important than the fact of
Russia's aggression? I am willing to let the campus
judge as to who is screaming loudly and throwing up
a smoke screen to «r>nfuse the real issue.
No one who does not believe that the all-important
thing is for all groups to work together to keep the
United States out of war should ever accept the re
sponsibility of being chairman of the Stanford Peace
Committee!
Without even taking a poll, the breezes of campus
opinion indicate that the campus is as bored with the
present name-calling campaign as I am.

mittee of the A.S.U. So worry no more because "no
hint was given whether the membership would take
sides." Second, since past presidents of the A.S.U. still
in school are extended the courtesy of being on the
Executive Committee, I might say: "I was there. I saw
it happen!" But the statement was released by the
Executive Committee, not me. This is immaterial, but
student papers should be careful of sloppy reporting.
Feeling that graduate students should be here for
serious study and that motivation and activation should
come from the undergraduates in student organiza
tions, I have tried to assume no responsibility in the
present "squabble" between the A.S.U. and the Daily
—sitting by while unsubstantiated "rumors" and state
ments by non-existent "minority leaders" were printed
as facts. But since the responsibility for yesterday's
statement was inaccurately attributed to me, perhaps
you will allow a few comments in return.

all-important concern facing America today IS
how we can stay out of war, how we can preserve
those democratic civil liberties guaranteed under the
constitution, not the fact of whether Russia is ag
gressing on Finland. Certainly much of the red-baiting
today »is using tlie latter as a cover for depriving
these same civil liberties we all believe in. Your edi
torial passed over very lightly, even ridiculed, these
constructive items of the A.S.U. program. Can you
deny that they are more important than the fact of
Russia's aggression? I am willing to let the campus
judge as to who is screaming loudly and throwing up
a smoke screen to «r>nfuse the real issue.
No one who does not believe that the all-important
thing is for all groups to work together to keep the
United States out of war should ever accept the re
sponsibility of being chairman of the Stanford Peace
Committee!
Without even taking a poll, the breezes of campus
opinion indicate that the campus is as bored with the
present name-calling campaign as I am.

It must be due to lack of facts and not personal
dislike for the A.S.U. or its members that, the campus
is being misled in regard to the A.S.U. First, the
statement released yesterday was passed unanimously
—both by the membership and the Executive Com
mittee of the A.S.U. So worry no more because "no
