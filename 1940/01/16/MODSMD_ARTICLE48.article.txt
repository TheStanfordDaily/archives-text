# 'Bonanza Inn' Tells Lusty Tale of Gaudy, Old Frisco
## 
### 
"BONANZA INN"—Carrol I). Hall and Oscar Lewis
Besides the fact that "Bonanza .Inn" is a well written, fascinating story
of early San Francisco, it is worth reading simply because it will lead to
a new appreciation of that often-heard phrase, "the good old days."
Certainly few of us have witnessed a splendor equal in lavishness to

that attributed to the Palace by#
Carroll D. Hall and Oscar Lewis, !
author of "The Big Four," in their
recent best seller.
The Messrs. Hall and Carroll par
tially explain "America's first lux
ury hotel" by describing the back
ground in which it was conceived. !
San Francisco in the 70's was "ar
rogant, boastful, teeming with en
ergy, . . . eager for any grandiose j
scheme that might suggest itself."
FORESAW NEED
William Ralston Chapman built the
hotel because he envisioned San
Francisco as what it has become, a j
large metropolitan city, proud host ,
to the world's notables. He foresaw !
the need for adequate, if not ele- ,
gant, facilities for receiving them.
As a matter of fact, Chapman was a |
little too far-seeing. The maoJve,
block-long structure nearly became j
a white elephant.
But they finally came . . . the i
world's notables found San Fran- |
cisco and The Palace. And it is of j
this fabric of the famous that "Bon- '
anza Inn' is woven. David War- j
field, William Howard Taft, Robert;
Louis - Stevenson, Ulysses Grant, j
Sarah Bernhardt, ihe visits of all !
these brilliant personalities who l
passed through the grand court of I
the Palace arc recorded against a |
background rich in the color of,
early San Francisco.
SHARON STORY TOLD
This local color is not always rele
gated to the background; a good
fourth of the book occupies itself
with the story of Sarah Alathea Hill
and Senator William Sharon, whose ,
divorce case and subsequent lives
furnished the nation's newspapermen
with copy from the time the story
"broke" in 1883 until Sarah's pa
thetic death in the Stockton State;
Hospital in 1937.
Taken as a whole, the book is j
certainly worth reading, not only j
for the factual matter revealed'
therein, but because the writing is j
equal to the material. Both are ex
cellent.. —Mullany

that attributed to the Palace by#
Carroll D. Hall and Oscar Lewis, !
author of "The Big Four," in their
recent best seller.
The Messrs. Hall and Carroll par
tially explain "America's first lux
ury hotel" by describing the back
ground in which it was conceived. !
San Francisco in the 70's was "ar
rogant, boastful, teeming with en
ergy, . . . eager for any grandiose j
scheme that might suggest itself."
FORESAW NEED
William Ralston Chapman built the
hotel because he envisioned San
Francisco as what it has become, a j
large metropolitan city, proud host ,
to the world's notables. He foresaw !
the need for adequate, if not ele- ,
gant, facilities for receiving them.
As a matter of fact, Chapman was a |
little too far-seeing. The maoJve,
block-long structure nearly became j
a white elephant.
But they finally came . . . the i
world's notables found San Fran- |
cisco and The Palace. And it is of j
this fabric of the famous that "Bon- '
anza Inn' is woven. David War- j
field, William Howard Taft, Robert;
Louis - Stevenson, Ulysses Grant, j
Sarah Bernhardt, ihe visits of all !
these brilliant personalities who l
passed through the grand court of I
the Palace arc recorded against a |
background rich in the color of,
early San Francisco.
SHARON STORY TOLD
This local color is not always rele
gated to the background; a good
fourth of the book occupies itself
with the story of Sarah Alathea Hill
and Senator William Sharon, whose ,
divorce case and subsequent lives
furnished the nation's newspapermen
with copy from the time the story
"broke" in 1883 until Sarah's pa
thetic death in the Stockton State;
Hospital in 1937.
Taken as a whole, the book is j
certainly worth reading, not only j
for the factual matter revealed'
therein, but because the writing is j
equal to the material. Both are ex
cellent.. —Mullany
