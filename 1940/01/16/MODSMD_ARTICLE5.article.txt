# Craig to Feature Rhuma Rhythms
## 
### 
The fiery rhythm of the rhumba
or the lilting tempo of the tangoâ€”
these are part of the evening's pro
gram of "dancing time to rhythm
and rhyme" that Carvel Craig, pop
ular maestro, will play for the
Toyon-Branner winter formal on
Friday night, Jan. 2.
Craig terms his Latin-American
melodies "Recuerdos Latinos," and
his arrangements of them have won
nation-wide interest over four radio
networks. Bids for Craig's Stanford
appearance are on sale to the entire
campus at the A.S.S.U. office,
priced at $1.75.
