(Last fall quarter's Daily news editor, who graduated in December,
presents today the first personal interview with Head Football Coach
Clark Shaughnessy designed for Stanford readers.—The Editor.)

CHICAGO. 111., .lan. 15.—"Stanford's policy is my policy from now on,
and I am making and will continue to make every effort to find out wliat
Stanford wants and likes." So spoke Clark D. Shaughnessy, Stanford's
recently appointed head football coach, today in a special Daily interview.
A mild-mannered man with definite views on the relationship between
a university and its football team, Shaughnessy is highly enthusiastic

about his appointment to the posi
tion of head coach of the Indian var
sity.
"To me, Stanford has a fine sense
of balance between the mental,
physical, and social activities of un
dergraduates," he declared. "Foot
ball, its practice and its playing, has
distinct educational value. Educa
tion means more to me than just the
training of the intellect, and it is on
that point that I differ with Presi
dent Hutchins. This is one of the
main reasons why I decided to ac
cept the fine offer from Stanfoi'd
and leave the University of Chicago.
I want to continue coaching inter
collegiate football, a profession 1
have followed for the last. 25 years."
CAME AFTER STAGG
Coach Shaughnessy became head
football coach on the Midway in
1933 upon the retirement of Amos
Alonzo Stagg, who is now at the
College of the Pacific.
Speaking of the Maroon elevens of
the past seven years. Shaughnessy
revealed that 50 per cent of the Chi
cago varsity grid squads had never
played football before coming to
Chicago. He also related that there
were more 18-year-old boys on the
Chicago team than the rest of the
Big Ten teams put together, in
cluding Notre Dame.
"One of the reasons for the big
scores against Chicago was the Uni
versity policy of letting every player
who wanted to play get into the
game. We were hopelessly out
classed, anyway, and it made no par
ticular difference."
Shaughnessy made no definite ar
rangements with the Board of Ath
letic Control when he was on the
Farm ten days ago concerning as
sistant varsity coaches. He did say,
however, that he hoped Jim Law
son, assistant coach, would remain
at his present post.
