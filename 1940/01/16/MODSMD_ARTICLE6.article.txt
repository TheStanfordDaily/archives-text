(Last fall quarter's Daily news editor, who graduated in December,
presents today the first personal interview with Head Football Coach
Clark Shaughnessy designed for Stanford readers.—The Editor.)

CHICAGO. 111., .lan. 15.—"Stanford's policy is my policy from now on,
and I am making and will continue to make every effort to find out wliat
Stanford wants and likes." So spoke Clark D. Shaughnessy, Stanford's
recently appointed head football coach, today in a special Daily interview.
A mild-mannered man with definite views on the relationship between
a university and its football team, Shaughnessy is highly enthusiastic

about his appointment to the posi
tion of head coach of the Indian var
sity.
"To me, Stanford has a fine sense
of balance between the mental,
physical, and social activities of un
dergraduates," he declared. "Foot
ball, its practice and its playing, has
distinct educational value. Educa
tion means more to me than just the
training of the intellect, and it is on
that point that I differ with Presi
dent Hutchins. This is one of the
main reasons why I decided to ac
cept the fine offer from Stanfoi'd
and leave the University of Chicago.
I want to continue coaching inter
collegiate football, a profession 1
have followed for the last. 25 years."
CAME AFTER STAGG
Coach Shaughnessy became head
football coach on the Midway in
1933 upon the retirement of Amos
Alonzo Stagg, who is now at the
College of the Pacific.
Speaking of the Maroon elevens of
the past seven years. Shaughnessy
revealed that 50 per cent of the Chi
cago varsity grid squads had never
played football before coming to
Chicago. He also related that there
were more 18-year-old boys on the
Chicago team than the rest of the
Big Ten teams put together, in
cluding Notre Dame.
"One of the reasons for the big
scores against Chicago was the Uni
versity policy of letting every player
who wanted to play get into the
game. We were hopelessly out
classed, anyway, and it made no par
ticular difference."
Shaughnessy made no definite ar
rangements with the Board of Ath
letic Control when he was on the
Farm ten days ago concerning as
sistant varsity coaches. He did say,
however, that he hoped Jim Law
son, assistant coach, would remain
at his present post.
Questioned as to whether lie had
made any general plans concerning
(lie system he would employ, Mr.
Shaughnessy remarked, "There is no
.such thing as a system of offense
in football. There are eleven men
mi the offensive' side, a set of rules,
and there are defensive "habits."
The type of offensive maneuvering
depends entirely on the material
available and the defensive "set
ups" of the opposition. You lit your
system to the material. I personally
like rhythm, movement, and decep
tion in football."
Wiih a five-year contract, Shaugh
nessy hopes to set up a "good, firm
foundation for Stanford football."
"However, the welfare of the play
ers, scholastically and physically,
comes first with me," he declared.
Asked if he knew about any
members of Stanford's grid squad,
the new Card mentor said he had
heard a great deal of Norm Stand
lee. "I only saw him from across
the street, but he certainly looks
like a fine football player to me,"
remarked the "Big Chief's" new
boss.
SAW TROJANS PLAY
Shaughnessy said he had only
seen two games representing Pacific
Coast football, U.S.C. vs. Notre Dame
and the Trojans again in the Rose
Bowl against Tennessee.
"Regarding this Chicago situa
tion," concluded Shaughnessy, "I
wouldn't have left Chicago if foot
ball hadn't 'resigned,' as I didn't
want to 'run out' on a tough job.
1 sincerely believe that a successful
football team is made and built up
off the practice field as much, if not
more, than on the practice, field.
"Stanford's attitude and general
environment is much more accept
able to me in this regard than was
Chicago's. Yes, I certainly am glad
of this opportunity to go out to
Stanford, and hope the players, stu
dents, alumni, and the University
will feel the same way."

father received the Stanford grid
ofler. Son Clark, Jr., has been at
U.C.L.A. lor three years, while
daughter Marcia Mae got as far
west as Stephen College, Missouri,
where she is a freshman. According
to her dad she expects to transfer
to the Farm.
!!AS TWO DAUGHTERS
Youngest daughter Janice, a jun
ior at the University high school on
the Midway, backed up her father's
statement that she had planned to
to to Stanford ever since she was in
the sixth grade. "And when I was
on the campus three years ago, f
was sure of it," the attractive bru
nette daughter replied.
"I'm leaving Chicago for the West
Coast the first week in March," said
Mr. Shaughnessy, "and the rest of
the family, including our two
grandmothers, will follow in the
summer."
As this writer left the family cir
cle, daughter Janice was having
quite a time convincing her father
that he just had to wear a tuxedo
to a reception that evening.
