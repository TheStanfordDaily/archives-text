Walt Heinecke, ex-Stanford Ail-
American, was admitted to the Palo
Alto Hospital Saturday following an
attack of bronchial pneumonia. His
physician, Dr. Milton Saier, an

danger. The attack developed from
a slight cold.
Mr. Heinecke won his niche in
Stanford's hall of fame in the Farm
team's first Rose Bowl game in 1928.
He actually won the game with his
nose.
Stanford was leading 7 to 0, when
Pittsburgh made a touchdown. Hei

jumping in the air to have the ball
bounce off his nose.
Don Liebendorfer of the B.A.C.
called Heinecke the "best all-around
center we ever had." He has owned
and managed the two campus Shell
gas stations for the last five or six
years.
