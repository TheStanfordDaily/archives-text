SILK STOCKINGS ' \
No matter whose shoes you're in if . \ '% \
you want to get the maximum in mile- \ \
age and comfort out of stockings, \ \
you'll want to be in Town Chiffon. \
Because of the Magic Twist, a \
special way of twisting the silk,
these stockings look oh-so-sheer yet
have such durability you can caper
from 'morn till night without "wear
out" worries.
