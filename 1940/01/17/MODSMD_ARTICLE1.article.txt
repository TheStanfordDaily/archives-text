### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
[FRANCE'S Chamber of Deputies
is going to be a considerably
smaller body in a few days.
Tli in fact was assured yesterday
when, by a vote of 521 to 2, the
Chamber passed a bill that will
force out of office 61 to 72 Com
munist Deputies sitting in the body,
as well as stripping them of their
parliamentary immunity.
At the same time, during the de
bate on the measure, charges rocked
the Chamber that men prominent in
French public life have "connived"
with Chancellor Adolf Hitler. And,
in reply, the government promised
an investigation by a military tri
bunal empowered to order arrests.
These startling allegations were
made during argument over the
government's bill to expel from Par
liament all Communist deputies who
have refused to repudiate publicly
Josef V. Stalin and Russia's policies.
By simple the whole
situation has an odd local twist.
Whether in France or at Stanford,
it doesn't pay to condone Russia's
aggression in northern Europe. It
doesn't even pay, speaking in a
negative way, NOT to repudiate it.
The A.S.IJ. found that out after it
failed to brand the Soviets as ag
gressors. All the Deputies in
France who seemed pro-Russian
have lost their jobs; and all the
A.S.U. members at Stanford who,
whether or not they are pro-Rus
sian, participated in the recent
small fiasco, have been politely
slapped on the wrist by (he Fourth
Estate. Russia and all things Rus
sian are, currently, unpopular and
unhealthy.
* * *
r J"*HE allegation that Hitler, though,
had enrolled partisans among
prominent French figures was made
by Deputy Henri De Kerillis, editor
of the newspaper L'Epoque and a
nationalist leader. It brought, a
swift and angry retort from Rightist
deputies, including Pierre Etienne
Flandin, who was former premier
and leader of the Rightist Party of
Democratic Alliance. Flandin was
premier, you may remember, in
1935 when Hitler denounced the
Versailles Treaty's military clauses
and staged the invasion of the
Rhineland. He wired congratulations
to Hitler and other leaders after the
Munich conference of September,
1938, which split up Czechoslovakia.
* * *
J JEBUKING De Kerillis, Flandin
said he approved and signed a
poster approving Germany's annex
ation of the Sudetenland and "con
gratulated the signatories for having
avoided war and opened an era of
peace.
"If I opposed war in 1938 it was
because France was unable to go to
war then for reasons I can only
discuss in secret committees," Flan
din said. "Was it a crime to oppose
a war at a time when our premier
said it would be a crime to go to
war?" Vice-premier Camille Chau
temps announced the government
would summon De Kei'illis to ap
pear immediately before a military
tribunal which will be pledged to
order arrests "if his facts and names
justify."
Both Hitler and Stalin were at
tacked during the debate preced
ing passage of the hill ousting the
"pro-Moscow" Communist depu
ties. Louis Frossard. a Socialist,
said Stalin "deliberately precipi
tated" the European war in hopes
it would facilitate the spread of
Communism.
This whole incident marks the
first actual and avowed political dis
crimination within a country that
World War II has seen. By direct
legislation, France is publicly at
tempting to direct members of the
Communist groups. And once more
the tightening, squeezing process of
intense Nationalism is under way—
not that, underneath, it hasn't been
going on for a long time.

"If I opposed war in 1938 it was
because France was unable to go to
war then for reasons I can only
discuss in secret committees," Flan
din said. "Was it a crime to oppose
a war at a time when our premier
said it would be a crime to go to
war?" Vice-premier Camille Chau

would summon De Kei'illis to ap
pear immediately before a military
tribunal which will be pledged to
order arrests "if his facts and names
justify."
Both Hitler and Stalin were at

Communism.
This whole incident marks the
first actual and avowed political dis
crimination within a country that
World War II has seen. By direct

[FRANCE'S Chamber of Deputies

when, by a vote of 521 to 2, the
Chamber passed a bill that will
force out of office 61 to 72 Com
munist Deputies sitting in the body,
as well as stripping them of their
parliamentary immunity.
At the same time, during the de
bate on the measure, charges rocked
the Chamber that men prominent in
French public life have "connived"
with Chancellor Adolf Hitler. And,
in reply, the government promised
an investigation by a military tri
bunal empowered to order arrests.
These startling allegations were
made during argument over the
government's bill to expel from Par
liament all Communist deputies who
have refused to repudiate publicly
Josef V. Stalin and Russia's policies.
By simple the whole
situation has an odd local twist.
Whether in France or at Stanford,
it doesn't pay to condone Russia's
aggression in northern Europe. It
doesn't even pay, speaking in a
negative way, NOT to repudiate it.
The A.S.IJ. found that out after it
failed to brand the Soviets as ag

France who seemed pro-Russian
have lost their jobs; and all the
A.S.U. members at Stanford who,
whether or not they are pro-Rus
