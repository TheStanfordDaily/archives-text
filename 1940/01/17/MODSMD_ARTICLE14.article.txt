## Committee Named To Investigate Smoking Problem 
### 
Forty years ago, Mrs. Leland Stan
ford .said she wished students would
not smoke on the Quad.
Yesterday, 100 cigarette butts were
counted at the Law Building, 45 at
the English Building, and other scat
tered stubs elsewhere in the Inner
Quad.
Last night, Ex Committee pon
dered what it could do to save this
tradition.
DIVISION ON VOTE
During a lengthy discussion of the
subject, members were divided
among (1) those who thought stu
dents smoke on the Quad because
they don't know of the tradition and
would stop if so informed, and (2)
those who thought students smoke
on Quad because they want to and
that the tradition should be sub
jected to a vote of the student body.
The suggestion of a vote on the
tradition was opposed by several
members, chiefly on grounds that
there would be some chance the
tradition would be abolished.
A subcommittee composed of Co
line Upshaw and Anne Townsend
was appointed to study 1 lie problem.

DIVISION ON VOTE
During a lengthy discussion of the
subject, members were divided
among (1) those who thought stu
dents smoke on the Quad because
they don't know of the tradition and
would stop if so informed, and (2)
those who thought students smoke
on Quad because they want to and
that the tradition should be sub
jected to a vote of the student body.
The suggestion of a vote on the
tradition was opposed by several
members, chiefly on grounds that
there would be some chance the
tradition would be abolished.
A subcommittee composed of Co
line Upshaw and Anne Townsend
was appointed to study 1 lie problem.
