## 
### 
Four hundred more rooters tick
ets for Friday night's Stanford-Cal
basketball game in the Pavilion will
go on sale at the B.A.C. box office
this morning at 8:30 o'clock, ac
cording to Don Liebendorfer, pub
licity director.
Cal returned the tickets which
they were unable to sell because the
university has not yet opened. The
tickels will be available both to stu
dents for 40 cents, and for general
admission at $1.10. Each ticket must
be accompanied by a student body
card, but a student may present two
cards.
