# Rally, Assembly Will Welcome New Grid Coach
## 
### 
Donning jeans and gingham
dresses and leaving their many au
tomobiles idle, Stanford's 4,000 stu
dents will hold a "Back to the Farm"
week in March, according to pre
liminary plans approved last night
by Ex Committee.
A welcome to Clark Shaughnessy,
scheduled to arrive at that, time, will
climax the week of celebration —
station rally in Palo Alto, parade
down Palm Drive, all-University
assembly with the new coach as
speaker.
Jack Alltucker, member of Cardi
nals, and Bill Turner presented tJie
plan, explaining they had "thought,
it up in a bull session—where all
good things start."
DANCE, PICNIC SUGGESTED
They suggested the week begin
with a beard-growing contest. Into
the week-end of March 8 and 9, ac
cording to their plan, would be
jammed a barn dance, barbecue,
welcome to Coach Shaughnessy,
Founders' Day program, and open
ing of Lake Lagunita.
During these two days, they sug
gested, a "kangaroo court." in front
of the Library would imprison for
15 minutes all offenders against the
rules against automobiles, neckties,
and "smoothness" in general.
Alltucker and Turner explained
they thought Back to the Farm week
a good idea because it would help
bring back "the good old Stanford
spirit."
"People here are getting stuck up
and snobbish, driving around in
their big cars with their noses in
the air. It would be good to get
the ties off them for a while," All
tucker declared. "This is getting U>
be a rich man's school—you can't
deny it."
COBBS VETOES JAIL
Sole serious objector to the pro
jected rustic festival was Student
Manager John Cobbs. Said Cobbs:
"I don't want to throw cold water,
but. I think the whole thing is kind
of silly. I can't see that 15-minute
jail and the ban on cars. People
have important things to do.
"Friendship is a spontaneous emo
tion. You can't grab a fellow by the
shirt-front, and say, 'Dammit, 1m:
friendly.'"
COURT TO BE JOKE
Alltucker explained that compul
sion would play no part in the
celebration, that the kangaroo court
would be a joke rather than an en
forcement agency.
Ex Committee approved the gen
eral proposal, making the reserva
tion that a tentative program be pre
sented within two weeks.
Alpha Phi Omega, national serv
ice fraternity composed of former
Boy Scouts, applied for the job of
handling the Shaughnessy welcome,

the program through the Associated
