## 
### 
LONDON, Jan. l(i (UP). —The sinking of five and possibly six sub
marines—three of them British—in the intensified war at sea was an
nounced today simultaneously with disclosure of daring British undersea
raids on Germany's heavily-defended Helgoland naval bases.
The French naval command announced the sinking of a German U-boat

in tlu Atlantic oil' Brittany and said
another was believed to have been
destroyed by a French destroyer
when about to attack a convoy.
A British defense plane along the
English coast was reported (o have
sunk still another German subma
rine with bombs.
HELGOLAND ATTACKS
The submarine operations against
Helgoland Bay, called "the wet tri
angle" by the Germans, arc of the
most dangerous type but volunteers
never are lacking because of the
chance of bagging a Nazi warship
t here.
The sinking of three small-type
but. modern submarines marked the
first admitted German victories over
the Allied undersea fleets as com
pared with British and French
claims of between 150 and 40 U-boats
destroyed since the start of the war.
The manner of the sinking of the
three submarines — the 640-ton Sea
horse and Starfish and the 540-ton
Undine—was not revealed, but the
German radio announced that they
were "destroyed in Helgoland Bight
through German defense measures."
BAY PENETRATED
Helgoland Bay, a maze of mine and
net traps, and patrolled constantly
by German naval patrol ships, has
been penetrated several times re
cently by British submarines, the
British stated.
The Germans said some of the
crews of the Starfish and Undine
were rescued.
The Germans first announced the
"destruction" of the Starfish and
Undine, with no mention of the Sea
horse, and the British admiralty at
first dismissed the announcement
with the statement:
"We are getting tired of denying
these German claims."
THREE U-BOATS LOST
A short time later, however, it was
admitted officially that not two but
three British submarines had been
lost.
Prime Minister Neville Chamber
lain, in the House of Commons, ex
pressed sorrow over the loss of the
submarines and their men and said
that, beyond the German radio an
nouncement, he had "no informa
tion as to the possible surviors."

BAY PENETRATED
Helgoland Bay, a maze of mine and
net traps, and patrolled constantly
by German naval patrol ships, has
been penetrated several times re
cently by British submarines, the
British stated.
The Germans said some of the
crews of the Starfish and Undine
were rescued.
The Germans first announced the
"destruction" of the Starfish and
Undine, with no mention of the Sea
horse, and the British admiralty at
first dismissed the announcement
with the statement:
"We are getting tired of denying
these German claims."
THREE U-BOATS LOST
A short time later, however, it was
admitted officially that not two but
three British submarines had been
lost.
Prime Minister Neville Chamber
lain, in the House of Commons, ex
pressed sorrow over the loss of the
submarines and their men and said
that, beyond the German radio an
nouncement, he had "no informa
tion as to the possible surviors."
LONDON, Jan. l(i (UP). —The sinking of five and possibly six sub
marines—three of them British—in the intensified war at sea was an
nounced today simultaneously with disclosure of daring British undersea
raids on Germany's heavily-defended Helgoland naval bases.
The French naval command announced the sinking of a German U-boat

in tlu Atlantic oil' Brittany and said
another was believed to have been
destroyed by a French destroyer
when about to attack a convoy.
A British defense plane along the
English coast was reported (o have
sunk still another German subma
rine with bombs.
HELGOLAND ATTACKS
The submarine operations against
Helgoland Bay, called "the wet tri
angle" by the Germans, arc of the
most dangerous type but volunteers
never are lacking because of the
chance of bagging a Nazi warship
t here.
The sinking of three small-type
but. modern submarines marked the
first admitted German victories over
the Allied undersea fleets as com
pared with British and French
claims of between 150 and 40 U-boats
destroyed since the start of the war.
The manner of the sinking of the
three submarines — the 640-ton Sea
horse and Starfish and the 540-ton
Undine—was not revealed, but the
German radio announced that they
were "destroyed in Helgoland Bight
through German defense measures."
