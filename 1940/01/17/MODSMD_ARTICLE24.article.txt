publican party, leaders; in all walks
: of life, in education, labor organiza

I ASSAILS NEW DEAL
The publisher bitterly assailed the
' New Deal, declaring that "if the
i New Deal had gone, unbridled.
1 down the road President Roosevelt
started to lead it three years ago, we
should have nothing left today but
the empty form of constitutional
democracy.
"There is little chance that free
dom can survive if the principles
written into our charter of freedom
—the constitution—are abandoned,"
he said. "Unless we fight to main
tain those principles, unless we stop
the destruction of private enterprise,
unless we put an end to the New
Dealers' insidious, creeping accumu
i lation of power over our lives, the
blackout of liberty will come to
I America as surely as it came to the
; dictator-ridden countries of Eu
i rope."
