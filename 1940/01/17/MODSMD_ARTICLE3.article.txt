# Senate Split Over F.D.R.'s Aid to Finns
## Export-Import Bank Loans Called Danger To U.S. Neutrality 
### Bv United Press 
A hot congressional fight over
American aid to Finland sparked
international developments Tuesday
soon after President Roosevelt urged
consideration of non-military loans
to the Finns through the Export-
Import Bank. He gave assurance the
loans would not compromise United
States neutrality policies.
First to challenge the President's
position that such loans would be
within the neutrality law was Sena
tor Walter F. George, D., Ga., who
beat the Roosevelt "purge" of 1938.
He said the loans would constitute
"an unneutral act under interna
tional law"
NO DIRECT LOAN
Senate Majority Leader Alben W.
Barkley, D, Ky., explained a direct
loan to Finland was not intended.
Nevertheless he regarded the Fin
nish proposal as dangerous.
The President's letter on Finland,
read to the legislators, began by de
claring "There is without doubt in
the United States a great desire to
assist Finland to finance the pur
chases of agricultural surpluses and
manufactured produi .s, not includ
ing implements of war." Mr. Roose
velt was especially emphatic in his
declaration that the neutrality policy
would not be endangered.
SOVIETS PROTEST AID
The Soviet press gild radio fol
lowed the government's formal pro
tests against Scandinavian aid to
the Finns with accusations that
Swedish military and gover nent
officials are engaged in recruiting
volunteers for Finland.
From Stockholm ca 1 ie ■ ord that
Sweden and Norway, ,<nt in the
face of a "war of net ' with So
viet Russia, are speed, g .shipments
of men and war mate els to Fin
land. There were newsp per appeals
for young men to volunt sr for serv
ice in the Finnish army.
The Soviet press strucl- aut, too, in
anger against what it c? Ed "mon
strous inventions" abro; i of Red
army defeats in Finland . nd prom
ised the Finnish forces vould be
destroyed.
FINNS REPULSE PLANE
The Finns announced leir air
force had "repelled" inva " : v ; recon
naissance squadrons of the Russian
air force while enemy land assaults
were being repulsed on the 3 arelian
Isthmus and near SalUi ii. tb north.
Bombing attacks by Russiat planes
continued, but with far lesj vigor
than during the previous foui ,d *\s.
The e icitement over the wee -end
precautions by the Netherlana and
Belgium died down but. the F
Foreign Office warned that any ler
man attempt to invade the lov uid
countries would find 1,000,000 D lch
and Belgian troops fighting ak g
sidc the Allies.
