MORE ABOUT THE
COACH SITUA lON
Many persons are curious as to (he
exact reasons why the Board of
Athletic Control discarded Buck
Shaw, Dud DeGroot, and Tex Ol
iver as prospective Stanford coaches.
There were definite reasons in each
case, besides the fact that Clark
Shaughnessy was available and the
members of the board were tre
mendously impressed by his per
sonality and recommendations.
It seems that Shaw was discarded
because his entire experience—both
in education and coaching—was tied
up with parochial schools. Further
more, the B.A.C. didn't want to take
the chance of alienating the friendly
relations that have been built up
over the past few years between
Stanford and Santa Clara.
DeGroot was given the go-by
because he had had absolutely no
experience with big-time coach
ing, his successes at San Jose State
being considered strictly minor
league stuff. Also. DeGroot had
admittedly availed himself fully of
the proselyting and subsidizing op
portunities offered at San Jose,
and the B.A.C. wanted to shy
away from anyone who didn't
have a pure record, especially so
in view of the new regulations
passed in (he Coast Conference as
the result of the Atherton probe.
Finally, Oliver was summarily dis
missed from consideration because
he is coaching at a school in the
same conference, and it was decided
by the B.A.C. that to woo him away
from Oregon would constitute a se
rious breach of etiquette.

UP HERE AND THERE
Although Stanford is supposed
to be one of the worst schools in
the country when it comes to the
alumni getting after the scalp of
the football coach, the Indians
have had only three head coaches
in the past 20 years, excluding
Shaughnessy. They were Gene
Van Gent, Pop Warner, and Tiny
Thornhill. Andy Kerr also mcn
tored here for two years, but he
was iust paving the way for War
ner, who was serving out his con
tract at Carlisle. Not many col
leges in the country can boast
such a record.
The father of Sid Hayes, a 14.5
high hurdler last year who has
forsaken the cinderpath for base
hall this year, was a member of
Coach Harry Wolter's first Cardi
nal varsity ball club over 20 years
ago.

BOSTON, Jan. 1G (UP). —The
champion Boston Bruins climbed
into a tie for the lead of the Na
tional Hockey League Monday when
they defeated the Detroit Red Wings,
3-1, in a listless game before 9,000
fans in Boston Garden.

MORE ABOUT THE
COACH SITUA lON
Many persons are curious as to (he
exact reasons why the Board of
Athletic Control discarded Buck
Shaw, Dud DeGroot, and Tex Ol
iver as prospective Stanford coaches.
There were definite reasons in each
case, besides the fact that Clark
Shaughnessy was available and the
members of the board were tre
mendously impressed by his per
sonality and recommendations.
It seems that Shaw was discarded
because his entire experience—both
in education and coaching—was tied
up with parochial schools. Further
more, the B.A.C. didn't want to take
the chance of alienating the friendly
relations that have been built up
over the past few years between
Stanford and Santa Clara.
DeGroot was given the go-by
because he had had absolutely no
experience with big-time coach
ing, his successes at San Jose State
being considered strictly minor
league stuff. Also. DeGroot had
admittedly availed himself fully of
the proselyting and subsidizing op
portunities offered at San Jose,
and the B.A.C. wanted to shy
away from anyone who didn't
have a pure record, especially so
in view of the new regulations
passed in (he Coast Conference as
the result of the Atherton probe.
Finally, Oliver was summarily dis
missed from consideration because
he is coaching at a school in the
same conference, and it was decided
by the B.A.C. that to woo him away
from Oregon would constitute a se
rious breach of etiquette.
LOOSE ENDS PICKED
UP HERE AND THERE
Although Stanford is supposed
to be one of the worst schools in
the country when it comes to the
alumni getting after the scalp of
the football coach, the Indians
have had only three head coaches
in the past 20 years, excluding
Shaughnessy. They were Gene
Van Gent, Pop Warner, and Tiny
Thornhill. Andy Kerr also mcn
tored here for two years, but he
was iust paving the way for War
ner, who was serving out his con
tract at Carlisle. Not many col
leges in the country can boast
such a record.
The father of Sid Hayes, a 14.5
high hurdler last year who has
forsaken the cinderpath for base
hall this year, was a member of
Coach Harry Wolter's first Cardi
nal varsity ball club over 20 years
ago.
