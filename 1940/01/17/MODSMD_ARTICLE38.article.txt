# Delts, Phi Delts Capture Lop-sided Cage Victories
## 
### 
Intramural basketball continued to roil along as six more games were
played. In the Encina gym all the games were lop-sided but in the Delta
Tau Delta victory over Theta Delta Chi a smooth basketball machine was
seen in the Delts.
The Delts were led by sharp-shooting Jack Ehrhart who made 1G points
in the 515-17 slaughter. Another power was seen in the pavilion when the

â–º Phi Delts swarmed all over the Sig
| ma Nus, 45-12. Paine led the scorers
! with eighteen points which was high
I for the entire evening.
Andy Stojkovich announced that
| new stop watches hid been pur
! chased and therefore the timing will
j be more efficient.
