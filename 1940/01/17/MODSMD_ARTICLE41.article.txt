# Frosh Opens Outdoor Practice
## 
### 
Stanford's yearling baseball team
reported outdoors for the first time
this season Monday as Coach
Harry Shipkey sent his charges
through light batting and fielding
practice on a damp field.
With the opening game less than
four week from now, chances for a
successful year are fairly bright.
Shipkey and his assistant, George
Farrell, expect Phil Wolf, Marvin
Harmes, and Brent "Tex" Kickard
to handle the pitching duties with
Bill Hanlon probably seeing action
behind the plate.
The makings of a good infield has
shown up rith Ray Hammett, first.
Tommy Howard and Bill Cunha,
second, Ted Falasco at short, and
Clark Graham, third base, looking
like a promising inner circle. Frosh
footballers Eric Armstrong, Don
Hoover, aid Carl Kellenberger look
to be jne brightest flychasing
prospects.
