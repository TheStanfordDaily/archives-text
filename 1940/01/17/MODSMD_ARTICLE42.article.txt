# Stanford Fears Towering Bear staple Champs
## Cal Five Boasts Three Veterans In Fall Squad 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Can Stanford withstand the slam
bang brand of basketball California
produces when the clubs meet Fri- ;
day in the third local Southern
Division game?
That seems to be a serious factor ■
that must be considered before pick- |
ing either the Indians or Bears;
Stanford, with a small team except :
for one member, will be faced with |
one of the tallest man-for-man ag- j
gregations on the Coast.

Bi|l Ogilvie and Bill Biggerstaff
are two veritable giants and their '
height is matched only by Dick Tay
lor, the Cards' 6-foot 7-inch center,
who will guard Ogilvie Friday.
Early in the season Cal boasted that ;
it could floor a quintet which would j
reach way up into the ozone in j
comparison with other clubs.
TEAM lIUNS PLAYS
Coach Everett Dean of the Indians j
knows that his club meets a team j
which will be entirely different from |
that of last week-end. But the team
he used in running Cal plays yes- j
terday was far from the big team j
which invades the Pavilion.
Stanford had very little trouble in j
taking care of all backboard shots j
by the Bruins in both Friday and ,
Saturday games. The situation isn't !
going to be anything like that, since |
the Bears with their great height j
around the backboard will be out to I
score a lot of points on tip-ins. Their
following after the ball is known to j
be something terrific, and Stanford's |
small men—except Taylor and pos- '
sibly Bill Cowden—will have trouble
on their hands.
The Indians will have to rely upon :
a nearly perfect floor game with lots i
of deception in their plays to trim
Nibs Price's outfit. That isn't ex- j
actly an impossibility since the lo- ]
cals were very impressive in their
initial game with the Bruins.
PREDICTION DIFFICULT
To tab the game is difficult. Stan- j
ford would be logical choices be- '
cause of their nearly clean slate of ;
pre-conference and initial league
games. However, the Bears, with !
only three victories since Dec. 23 as
against 11 defeats, are a steadily im- j
proving quintet. Their role as de- '
fending conference champs with |
three returning lettermen also should
cast a large vote in their favor— I
record or no record.
Tapering off for the Cal game is
in order from this afternoon. The j
Bear offensive was given a test'
against Stanford's defense yesterday
with little success. The Indians' i
scoring seemed to have picked up. j
Fordy Anderson has been slowed
down with his charley horse but i
will be ready to start.

Nibs Price's outfit. That isn't ex- j
actly an impossibility since the lo- ]
cals were very impressive in their
initial game with the Bruins.
PREDICTION DIFFICULT
To tab the game is difficult. Stan- j
ford would be logical choices be- '
cause of their nearly clean slate of ;
pre-conference and initial league
games. However, the Bears, with !
only three victories since Dec. 23 as
against 11 defeats, are a steadily im- j
proving quintet. Their role as de- '
fending conference champs with |
three returning lettermen also should
cast a large vote in their favor— I
record or no record.
Tapering off for the Cal game is
in order from this afternoon. The j
Bear offensive was given a test'
against Stanford's defense yesterday
with little success. The Indians' i
scoring seemed to have picked up. j
Fordy Anderson has been slowed
down with his charley horse but i
will be ready to start.
Can Stanford withstand the slam
bang brand of basketball California
produces when the clubs meet Fri- ;
day in the third local Southern
Division game?
That seems to be a serious factor ■
that must be considered before pick- |
ing either the Indians or Bears;
Stanford, with a small team except :
for one member, will be faced with |
one of the tallest man-for-man ag- j
gregations on the Coast.

Bi|l Ogilvie and Bill Biggerstaff
are two veritable giants and their '
height is matched only by Dick Tay
lor, the Cards' 6-foot 7-inch center,
who will guard Ogilvie Friday.
Early in the season Cal boasted that ;
it could floor a quintet which would j
reach way up into the ozone in j
comparison with other clubs.
TEAM lIUNS PLAYS
Coach Everett Dean of the Indians j
knows that his club meets a team j
which will be entirely different from |
that of last week-end. But the team
he used in running Cal plays yes- j
terday was far from the big team j
which invades the Pavilion.
Stanford had very little trouble in j
taking care of all backboard shots j
by the Bruins in both Friday and ,
Saturday games. The situation isn't !
going to be anything like that, since |
the Bears with their great height j
around the backboard will be out to I
score a lot of points on tip-ins. Their
following after the ball is known to j
be something terrific, and Stanford's |
small men—except Taylor and pos- '
sibly Bill Cowden—will have trouble
on their hands.
The Indians will have to rely upon :
a nearly perfect floor game with lots i
of deception in their plays to trim
Nibs Price's outfit. That isn't ex- j
actly an impossibility since the lo- ]
cals were very impressive in their
initial game with the Bruins.
