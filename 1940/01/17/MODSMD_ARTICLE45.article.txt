# Transfers Give Farm Flashy Sprint Quartet
## 
### 
Two events which Coach Bill El
! lington won't have to worry about
I in the still di.stunt track season are
, the sprints. For Mr. Ellington has a
I battery of four sprinters who are
| capable of taking points against any
| team on the Coast, including even
■ U.S.C.'s mighty horde.
! This year's track team is captained
! by the best of the dash men, in fact,
; by the best white sprinter in the
world —Clyde Jeffrey. Clyde proved
| his claim to international fame by

I whipping soundly all the competi
| tion that European or Scandinavian
countries could offer him on his
tour last summer.
Besides JefT, Ellington will be
working with three junior college
j transfer speed-burners, Ken Bat
taglia, Don McFarland, and Bob
Williams. All of these three can do
! the furlong in less than 22 seconds.
Jn practice yesterday Stan An
dersen put the shot 51 ft. 9 in. and
I Amie Cornett twirled the discus 149

feet. Time trials are slated for the
end of the week.
