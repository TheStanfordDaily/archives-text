# "After They've Seen Paree"

### 
FOR more than a good many years now
people have been mourning the passing of
"the good old days" at Stanford.
Discussions on this subject always have been
something like the conversation of Mark
Twain's friends about the weather: everybody
talked about it, but nobody did anything
about it.
All this was true up to the time when Ex
Committee met last night. It was then that Bill
Turner and Jack Alltucker upset this insidious
precedent by appearing before the students'
governing body and proposing that for one
week in the year, at least, Stanford should forget
about its modern improvements and relive "the
good old days."
"Back to the Farm!" was their war-cry, and
"Back to the Farm!" became the by-word of Ex
Committee last night.
Enthusiastically the representatives voted in
favor of incorporating an unusual list of campus
events into a program of old-time Stanford spirit.
Included in the tentative plans were a beard
growing contest, wearing farm clothes for one
day, a barn dance, kangaroo courts, the second
annual Boathouse Day and barbecue, and per
haps even the elimination of cars from campus
driving for one day.
That the "Back to the Farm" movement is
something more than an undergraduate three
ring circus was definitely evidenced by the
fact that Ex Committee is considering including
in its schedule a welcoming celebration for the
new football coach.
Clark Shaughnessy is expected to arrive at
Stanford during the first week in March when
the program will take place. If a large group
of students were to meet him at the station,
escort him back to the campus, and listen to
him speak in Memorial Hall, they will be giving
him the best possible start for his coaching
career on the Farm.
The difficulties that the new coach is going to
have to face, indifference, individualism, and
the lack of a friendly, co-operative spirit are the
same troubles that menace every activity on
the campus.
"Back to the Farm" week is being designed to
eliminate this self-satisfied attitude and to sub
stitute the old-fashioned spirit, that spirit which
is best exemplified today by the "hello" tra
dition.
Perhaps one week of old-time fun and friend
liness will convince Stanford that they might
be worth while all year long.

something more than an undergraduate three
ring circus was definitely evidenced by the
fact that Ex Committee is considering including
in its schedule a welcoming celebration for the
new football coach.
Clark Shaughnessy is expected to arrive at
Stanford during the first week in March when
the program will take place. If a large group
of students were to meet him at the station,
escort him back to the campus, and listen to
him speak in Memorial Hall, they will be giving
him the best possible start for his coaching
career on the Farm.
The difficulties that the new coach is going to
have to face, indifference, individualism, and
the lack of a friendly, co-operative spirit are the
same troubles that menace every activity on
the campus.
"Back to the Farm" week is being designed to
eliminate this self-satisfied attitude and to sub
stitute the old-fashioned spirit, that spirit which
is best exemplified today by the "hello" tra
dition.
Perhaps one week of old-time fun and friend
liness will convince Stanford that they might
be worth while all year long.
FOR more than a good many years now
people have been mourning the passing of
"the good old days" at Stanford.
Discussions on this subject always have been
something like the conversation of Mark
Twain's friends about the weather: everybody
talked about it, but nobody did anything
about it.
All this was true up to the time when Ex
Committee met last night. It was then that Bill
Turner and Jack Alltucker upset this insidious
precedent by appearing before the students'
governing body and proposing that for one
week in the year, at least, Stanford should forget
about its modern improvements and relive "the
good old days."
"Back to the Farm!" was their war-cry, and
"Back to the Farm!" became the by-word of Ex
Committee last night.
Enthusiastically the representatives voted in
favor of incorporating an unusual list of campus
events into a program of old-time Stanford spirit.
Included in the tentative plans were a beard
growing contest, wearing farm clothes for one
day, a barn dance, kangaroo courts, the second
annual Boathouse Day and barbecue, and per
haps even the elimination of cars from campus
driving for one day.
