# No Smoking â€” No!
## 
### 
LAST night Ex Committee officially recog
nized the fact that a great many people
smoke on the Quad, pondered the problem, and
referred it to a subcommittee for investigation.
Next week Ex Committee will decide what it
is going to do about it.
On one score the student representatives
were unanimous: they expressed their con
viction that the "no smoking" tradition is in
every way desirable and that there is no point
in taking a vote to determine whether the
campus wants it abolished or not.
Anyone with a thorough knowledge of Stan
ford life realizes that neatly printed signs in
classrooms or other polite but firm reminders
probably would only have a negative effect.
Traditions cease to exist when they are written
as rules.
At the present time countless cigarette butts
in the Inner Quad testify to the fact that con
siderable smoking is done there every day.
How to put a stop to this constitutes a major
problem in diplomatic strategy.
Unfortunately Machiavelli and Metternich
were not at hand last night when President
Cuthbertson appointed his subcommittee.
