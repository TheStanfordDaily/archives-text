# Toward a Better Choice
## 
### 
UNCERTAIN is perhaps the word that most
nearly characterizes the average college
student as regards his choice of a vocation. He
may have a good idea of where his interests lie,
he may know what major subject he gets along
in best, but he does not have a definite view of
the possibilities in his chosen field.
Knowing what is expected in the way of
academic knowledge and experience in appli
cants for jobs in various businesses is very
important in training for those lines of work.
And that is where Stanford's Vocational
Guidance Committees come into the local pic
ture.
Organized about five years ago, re-organized
extensively last year, the women's committee
was formed to aid them in their choice of a
vocation. This year, under the sponsorship of
the office of the Dean of Men and the members
of E>: Committee, another group was organized
.ilong the same lines as the first to do the same

for the men students. Tonight, the Men's Vo
cational Guidance Committee meets for the first
time.
Experts in such fields as law, medicine, en
gineering, and business will meet with stu
dents, for a lecture and an hour of questioning.
The men's group will take up such ordinarily
mysterious subjects as the importance of grades
in getting and keeping a job, the length of time
required for a newcomer into the field to sup
port a wife, the best choice of a course of
study. These aspects of the committee's work
will add immeasurable practical value to the
ordinary university curriculum.
If the series do not actually determine the
futures of those attending the meetings, they
will at least add value and significance to the
courses in which the participants are enrolled.
