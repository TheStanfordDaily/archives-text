BRITISH APPLESAUCE â€¢
IVO MATTER what failings the English may have,
there is one field in which their supremacy Ls un
challenged: They are the most convincing and re
markable propagandists in the world. Most people
who read Chamberlain's and Churchill's word-wars
on aggression really believe that those fine old states
men are baring their undisguised souls.
It seldom occurs to us when we are reading the
impassioned words "'Hitler is a liar" that the British
have been pretty good at the diplomatic art of pre
varication themselves. It seldom occurs to us that
Britain broke her word to Ethiopia and made a profit
able deal with Mussolini for the "civilization" of that
"backward nation." It seldom occurs to us that Brit
ain played ball with Hitler in Czechoslovakia and Aus
tria, not so much in the interests of peace, but more
in the interests of the British pound.
But every one of Hitler's lies are almost imme
diately obvious. All he wanted was Austria; Germany
must have Sudetenland, too. All he wanted was
Czechosolvakia; Germany must have Poland, too. Such
obvious lies. Such lack of subtlety.

|>UT the British don't exactly lie; they just use diplo
macy. While it is profitable for them to flirt with
Fascism, they extoll the virtues of peace. While they
toy with the idea of gaining power by an alliance with
Russia, they say that Soviet Russia is really on the
side of democracy. And when it is no longer econom
ically advisable to give the Nazis a free rein, they
emphasize the need for international civilization. In
short, a shrewd British industrialist is never caught
without a convenient ideal.
Now all this doesn't make Hitler any more trust
worthy. I would much rather gamble for my life
with one of those one-armed bandit slot-machines
than trust Hitler if he told me the sun would rise in
the east tomorrow. That's the nice thing about British
propaganda: They use facts to conceal selfish motives.
When they tell us that. Hitler is a liar, we recognize
the facts as true. And hence we are too prone to
believe that the whole British cause is sincere.
So all that training at Eton and Oxford isn't wasted
on British statesmen. Just compare the "diplomacy"
of an English lord and an Austrian housepainter.
Britain's second line of defense is her navy. Her
first is her applesauce.
