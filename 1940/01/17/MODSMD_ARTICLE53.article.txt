# CAMPUS OPINION
## NO PIONEERS, WE HALL WOMEN 
### 
EDITOR, SIR:
At the risk of appearing disloyal to my sex,
and the "girls' side," I should like to point out to
"One of the Sisters":
1. That hall girls do not necessarily lack an oppor
tunity to develop character.
2. That one may be an individualist without being
anti-social.
3. That the halls are not without comforts, and that
the hall girls do not live "like pioneers or some
thing."
4. Hall girls also live with a group of other girls.
And it might be in order to conduct a research proj
ect to see if the opportunity for the well-bred collcge
girl to learn co-operation is limited entirely to
sororities.

r JpiIE EDITOR, SIR:
It seems to me that perhaps "one of the sisters"
on the Row needs to have certain facts brought, to her
attention. I noticed her letter, published in this col
umn on Friday, was addressed to the "complex mascu
line mind." However, I think a little clear thought on
her part might be well in order before she tries to
convince our masculine element on the campus about
anything. In truth, she succeeds only in disgusting
some of her own sisters by her remarks, for they see
that, she herself has not the ability to think straight
"when women arc discussing women."
Since when, may I ask, are individuals necessarily
anti-social? Certainly my sister means thus in saying,
"Those who criticize sororities seem to think that it
is the best possible thing to make girls individualists.
But I should like to know if girls really ought to be
so anti-social." The dictionary (The Winston Simpli
fied, 1930, if that will be sufficiently authoritative) de
fines an "individualist" as "one who thinks or acts in
dependently," while "anti-social" is defined as "adverse
or hostile to the principles on which society is based."

JjT'S LATE, and rushing has worn me out, but you
look up "independent," "think," and "act" and any
other words you don't understand. Now, are we agreed
that Hall women aren't anti-social? Oh, I guess there
are some, but living on the Row often makes it hard
to get acquainted with everyone, so maybe I don't
know.
Another thing, whatever makes you think all those
girls in Lagunita, Casa Ventura, and Union are "pio
neers?" ... Go over to Lagunita and look at the
barracks those poor girls are living in. You have
your comforts, so do we, but think of the University
housing the rest of the campus in such a place! It's
a shame. I guess it's the view out in the court that
makes you think they're pioneers—having such a
large, stretching vista. . . .
Don't think wo on the Row are so too, too utterly,
utterly—we're not, and we might as well take our
share of criticism. . . .
I'd love to hear from you, but if you do write,
why don't some other sisters stick by me. If you
other sisters don't it. might look to those Hall girls
as if we weren't individualists, that we will "co-oprr
ate" with anything ridiculous that's said or written
just because it's pro-Row. There must be some girls
who daro to think, aren't there?—besides the anti
social Hall people.
With all sincerity,
Another of the "Sisters"
P.S.: Remember tin- dictionary—"think."
