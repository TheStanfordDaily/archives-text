EVANS' HAMLET SINCERE
Any play that can command an .
audience's attention from 7:30 to [
11:30, without once causing a mo-|
ment of wonderment as to how long,
it'll be until the next intermission,
is good entertainment. And this is a j
mild statement of praise.
Hamlet, as conceived by Maurice j
Evans, is no weakling, a victim of j
indecision or helpless dismay; he is j
no sly, conniving revenge-seeker; he j
is no sad, melancholic orator of!
high-flown phrases. Maurice Evans' I
Hamlet is a normal young man I
whose reactions to the murder of his i
father and the twisted chain of events j
that follows are equally normal. He
is a sincere, thoughtful, average per
son facing "something rotten in Den
mark"; and he cleans it up.
STEEPED IN CLASSIC LORE
To say this implies that the cur
rent. production lacks the classic
tone that is traditionally associated
with Shakespearean drama. This is
not true, for Maurice Evans is al
ways an eloquent. Hamlet. He is
more lively than Leslie Howard in
the same role, wilh less of the lyric
quality that Howard gave the part.
Evans is straightforward, vigorous.
And his voice is capable of every
shading of emotion, every nuance of
expression.
You have a thrill awaiting you in ;
this performance of one of the great

est tragedies of all time — in the
graveyard scene, in Ophelia's mad
scene, in Hamlet's "to-be-or-not-to
be" soliloquy, in the play sequence.
The staging is magnificent, and
the supporting cast, including Mady
Christians, Henry Edwards, and
Raymond Johnson, is excellent.

uine experience.—Hutchinson

more lively than Leslie Howard in

Evans is straightforward, vigorous.
And his voice is capable of every
shading of emotion, every nuance of
expression.
You have a thrill awaiting you in ;
this performance of one of the great

est tragedies of all time — in the
graveyard scene, in Ophelia's mad
scene, in Hamlet's "to-be-or-not-to

The staging is magnificent, and

"HAMLET," with Maurice Evans, currently playing at San Francisco's
Geary Theater.
If you're contemplating a trip along San Francisco's "white way" to
the Geary where, for the next two weeks, Maurice Evans and his superb
group of Shakespearean actors are performing "Ilamlet," you'd better race

through an early dinner and forget#
that after-dinner coffee. You won't)
need it. because for four solid hours j
you'll follow the strange, fascinating I
tale of the Prince of Denmark.
EVANS' HAMLET SINCERE
Any play that can command an .
audience's attention from 7:30 to [
11:30, without once causing a mo-|
ment of wonderment as to how long,
it'll be until the next intermission,
is good entertainment. And this is a j
mild statement of praise.
Hamlet, as conceived by Maurice j
Evans, is no weakling, a victim of j
indecision or helpless dismay; he is j
no sly, conniving revenge-seeker; he j
is no sad, melancholic orator of!
high-flown phrases. Maurice Evans' I
Hamlet is a normal young man I
whose reactions to the murder of his i
father and the twisted chain of events j
that follows are equally normal. He
is a sincere, thoughtful, average per
son facing "something rotten in Den
mark"; and he cleans it up.
