# Stanford Women Rule Hawkins Hop
## 
### 
With the storm of Sadie Hawkins j
days and dances sweeping the col
leges of the country, Stanford's
Class of '42 is combining the leap ;
year influence and the ideas started
from the "Li'l Abner" comic strip
for their "Sadie Hawkins Hop" to he
held in the Women's Gym Jan. 27.
With the provision that women
are the only ones who can purchase
bids and must do the inviting, Stan- |
ford men are beginning to realize j
what it feels like to sit home waiting j
for a date.
Bids for the ''Go Hag" dance are
on sale in the A.S.S.U. office for $1.
Attire for the affair will be in the
true Dogpatch fashion with cords,
jeans, and ginghams predominating.
I Chairman Ruth Whitney and as
| sistants Jane Thornton and Libby (
' Eastman are following out the idea
i that the "Sadie Hawkins Hop" will (
jbe truly a closed affair with the i
j women doing all the work and all j
i the inviting. j
