### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
AN EPIDEMIC of attempts at
sabotage has blossomed all over
the world. World War II is taking its
toll of internal disquietude and
worry. And the fear isn't confined to
one country alone. America has her
"Christian front" of fantastic trai
tors. In San Mateo officers uncov
ered five crudely fashioned black
powder bombs in a former head
quarters of the Ham an' Eggs pen
sion plan and immediately the buga
boo of traitorship arose.
In England, six hundred thou
sand British railroad men were
put on the alert at the same time
against a reported plot by the Ger
man Intelligence Service to sab
otage communications, public
works, bridges, and railroads.

Europe was moderately quiet yes
terday, except for occasional cries
of alarm. In Sweden, the parliament
was thrown into an uproar when the
Foreign Minister, Richard Sandler,
strongly denounced the govern
ment's present policy of neutrality.
Sandler left his position in the Cabi
net not long ago after being criti
cized by German newspapers as agi
tating against the Nazis. In the par
liament meeting, he favored more
positive steps to protect Sweden and
defend its neutrality.

he said, "should have
k dispatched armed forces to
the Aaland Islands in order to se
cure their neutrality." The Aaland
Islands are strategically important
points and they lie between Sweden
and Finland at the mouth of the Gulf
of Bothnia. Under League of Na
tions regulations Finland has exer
cised sovereignty over them for some
time. What Sandler didn't seem to
consider was the fact that Swedish
aggression in the islands would have
been, under international law, just
as reprehensible as Russian aggres
sion there. Invasion is invasion, even
though the Swedes could have
avowed their fine, worthy inten
tions of helping the Finns.

Sandler was loudly cheered by
Ihe parliament — and by the gal
leries. Earlier in the day, govern
ment leaders had rejected propos
als for expulsion of Communists
from parliament. At least Sweden
didn't oust the Reds as France
bad done the day before.
Europe's western front was im
mobilized by extreme cold. The
Finns, though suffering intense cold,
reported successfully resisting a Rus
sian offensive on the Salla front
aimed at cutting the country in two.
In every land there was speculation
as to what will happen when the
winter breaks and in Italy there
were words that indicated a grow
ing question as to Fascist neutrality.
"We must not sleep in the illusion
that Italy's present stand regarding
the conflict will be perpetual," Gen
eral Ettore Muti, secretary-general
of the Fascist party, declared.
"Fascist Italy might find itself at
any moment faced with the neces
sity and duty of taking up arms."

'jPHIS was a strong assertion from j
Italy — the most definite stand
that the Fascists have made in re
lation to the international scene since
they blasted Germany for falling
prey to the menace of Communism
and destroying the barriers between
western Europe and the Soviets.
Italy's greatest concern, lately, has
been against the threat of a spread
of Bolshevism into the Balkans.
British government chieftains,
while they were taking precau
tions against Gcynan sabotage,
were understood to have informa
tion indicating that Adolf Hitler
was considering a great aerial at
tack on British ports and other
transportation centers some time
this spring. All of this frenzied in
ternal preparation—the enlisting
of hundreds of thousands of rail
road men and perhaps key men
in other positions—hinges around
the warnings that Neville Cham
berlain and other cabinet officers
have issued lately, warnings that
the war may soon enter a more
acute phase.
