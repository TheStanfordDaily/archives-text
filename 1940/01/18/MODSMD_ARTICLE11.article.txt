# Lunch Club Hears U.S. Liberty Praised
## 
### 
People in this country of German
birth, background, and descent are
not only loyal to American prin
ciples and institutions, but are ac
tually practicing and contributing to
the culture of the United States,
said Dr. Martin Hall, secretary and
organizer of the German-American
League for Culture in his speech
before the Luncheon Club in the
Nitery yesterday noon.
"I think we should not forget
what Germany is contributing to the
world when it puts out of the coun
try men like Einstein and Thomas
Mann," said Dr. Hall. These men, he
pointed out, come to America where
they have a freedom to work far
greater than they have ever had in
Germany.
Germans in the United Slates
realize what they are enjoying here
and what they would have to give
tip if they were to go back to Ger
many, said Dr. Hall. There are a
very small percentage who want to
go back, he said.
Although Dr. Hall is opposed to
the German-American Bund, he
does not underestimate its leaders.
"Just because people laugh at the
Bund means nothing," he said.
"People laughed at Hitler at first.
Under certain circumstances, espe
cially under certain economic cir
cusmtances, Fascism is possibly any
where, even here."
Dr. Hall prophesies a revolution
in Germany against Hitler at the
end of the war. Until then, he be
lieves, Americans who know the
true nature of Germany through her
immigrants should help to keep
alive her culture until .she has once
again regained her place.
