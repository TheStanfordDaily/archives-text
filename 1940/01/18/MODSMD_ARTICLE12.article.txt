# Henshaw Stars In Coming Play
## Berry to Co-star In 'Warrior's Husband' 
### 
Leap year, with its attendant man
hunts, is getting more than usual at
tention on the Farm this quarter,
what with the Sophomore class's
"Sadie Hawkins Hop" and the Divi
sion of Speech and Drama's produc
tion of "Tlie Warrior's Husband,"
which will take the boards of Memo
rial Hall for a three-performance
run beginning two weeks from to
night.
The men haven't a chance in this
satiric version of the old Greek
legend about the magic girdle of
the Amazon queen which gives her
and the women of her land the
power to rule over men. Hercules,
in expiation for a crime of youth,
is ordered by the gods to perform
12 labors. The ninth of these is to
get the girdle of Hyppolyta, the
Amazon queen.
It is here that both the Amazons
and the Greek army run into dif
ficulties, and oddly enough, the
Greeks have the most trouble when
they are in possession of the girdle
for the entire Greek army is nearly
demoralized.
Playing the romantic leads are
Sylvia Berry and Bucky Henshaw,
as Antiop, general of the Amazon
armies, and Theseus, general of the
Greek forces, respectively. Their
love affair, as the author of this
play paints it, is undoubtedly one of
the oddest on record.
Strange, too, is the marriage of
Hyppolyta, queen of the Amazons,
to Sapiens, charming and flirtatious
little son of one of her councilors.
Norman Ross plays the erring
husband-in-name-only in the Stan
ford version, and Sylvia Onesti is
his neglectful wife.
