# BOTANIST CLASSIFIES 360,000 FLOWERS

### BUD AMES 
Gilia Abramsii — it's a flowering
plant and it took its scientific name
from Professor Loßoy Abrams,
Stanford botanist and director of the
Natural History Museum.
Professor Abrams' heart interest
is the Dudley Herbarium, which to
you means a room where dried and
pressed plants are filed. He proudly
I pointed out his wards, close to 100
cases filled with specimens which
number about 260,000 mounted ones
and about 100,000 unmounted.
The modest professor graduated
from the Farm in '99.
I CAME AS JUNIOR
"And believe it or not, I came in
here as a junior from U.5.C.," he
said with a smile. "But that was be
fore they played football."
From here he moved to the Uni
versity of Idaho, back here, then to
Columbia, and in 1905 to the larg
est herbarium in the world, the
Smithsonian Institute in Washing
ton, as assistant curator of plants.
In 1900, just after the earthquake,
he returned to the Farm as an as
sistant professor. He wasn't sure
the exact year lhat he was made a
full professor but it was "long
enough ago."
INVESTIGATES HAY FEVER
Still modest, the professor would
give no scientific names but he esti
mated that he has discovered 25 to
30 new species of plants—a lot. of
hunting. In addition to the Gilia
Abramsii, he has had two other
plants named after him, the Gilia
Royalis—taken from his first name
and Abramsia, which is a flora grow
ing in the Fiji Islands.
"In addition to my other work,
j I've been doing some botanical hay
j fever investigation for the Southern
I Pacific Hospital," he continued. "I've
| been determining when and where

hay-fever-causing plants bloom. In
cidentally, around this region in
spring, rye grass is the biggest cause
of hay fever, and weeds and some
trees get in their work."
"And the golden rod isn't so bad
as they say. There's practically
none around here."
In addition to serving on Stan

ford's big four, the Advisory Board.
Graduate Study Board, Executive
Committee, and Student Affairs
Committee, the professor last year
acted as president of the Pacifiic di
vision of the Botanical Society of
America, which held a conference
on the Farm last summer.
"Of course we did read some sci

entific papers, but (he meeting was
men whose material we had been
more of a get-together of all (he
using," he explained. "Our situa
tion was similar to what Borah said
i about President Roosevelt. 'He can
make me believe anything. If I
want the truth, I've got to read it.'
So we didn't read many scientific
papers."
Professor Abrams' particular field
of study comes under the head of
Forest Botany, which includes
flowering plants, with the emphasis
on trees and shrubs.
! Auto field trips usually to Yose-
I mite is another innovation instituted
by the kindly professor since the
roads have become good. About 12
to 20 students make (his scientific
jaunt (o study (he trees and tree
| bells. The professor calls it the "de
luxe botany trip in the U.S."
WORKING ON BOOK
You couldn't count the papers and
pamphlets he's written on your
i hands and toes. He has also stepped
into (he book field wi(h a three
edition book, "Los Angeles Flora,"
and another called, "Trees and
j Shrubs of Southern California." At
i present he is working on the third
I volume of a series called "Illustrated
j Flora of the Pacific Coast. He
I pointed out a six-inch pile of manu-
I scripts by way of explanation.
Strictly a Stanford family, the
professor met Mrs. Abrams here on
j the Farm. Their daughter, Marget,
j whom they lost recently, graduated
from Stanford in 1932, a member of
j Cap and Gown.
On the way out, he again pointed
; proudly at his herbarium, his rows
jof cases. We mentioned the large
cardboard boxes on top of (he cases.
"Those are what we call the de
i pression files, since we haven't been
j able to afford others." he said with
another chuckle.

sistant professor. He wasn't sure
the exact year lhat he was made a
full professor but it was "long
enough ago."
INVESTIGATES HAY FEVER
Still modest, the professor would
give no scientific names but he esti
mated that he has discovered 25 to
30 new species of plants—a lot. of
hunting. In addition to the Gilia
Abramsii, he has had two other
plants named after him, the Gilia
Royalis—taken from his first name
and Abramsia, which is a flora grow
ing in the Fiji Islands.
"In addition to my other work,
j I've been doing some botanical hay
j fever investigation for the Southern
I Pacific Hospital," he continued. "I've
| been determining when and where

hay-fever-causing plants bloom. In
cidentally, around this region in
spring, rye grass is the biggest cause
of hay fever, and weeds and some
trees get in their work."
"And the golden rod isn't so bad
as they say. There's practically
none around here."
In addition to serving on Stan

ford's big four, the Advisory Board.
Graduate Study Board, Executive
Committee, and Student Affairs
Committee, the professor last year
acted as president of the Pacifiic di
vision of the Botanical Society of
America, which held a conference
on the Farm last summer.
"Of course we did read some sci

entific papers, but (he meeting was
men whose material we had been
more of a get-together of all (he
using," he explained. "Our situa
tion was similar to what Borah said
i about President Roosevelt. 'He can
make me believe anything. If I
want the truth, I've got to read it.'
So we didn't read many scientific
papers."
Professor Abrams' particular field
of study comes under the head of
Forest Botany, which includes
flowering plants, with the emphasis
on trees and shrubs.
! Auto field trips usually to Yose-
I mite is another innovation instituted
by the kindly professor since the
roads have become good. About 12
to 20 students make (his scientific
jaunt (o study (he trees and tree
| bells. The professor calls it the "de
luxe botany trip in the U.S."
WORKING ON BOOK
You couldn't count the papers and
pamphlets he's written on your
i hands and toes. He has also stepped
into (he book field wi(h a three
edition book, "Los Angeles Flora,"
and another called, "Trees and
j Shrubs of Southern California." At
i present he is working on the third
I volume of a series called "Illustrated
j Flora of the Pacific Coast. He
I pointed out a six-inch pile of manu-
I scripts by way of explanation.
Strictly a Stanford family, the
professor met Mrs. Abrams here on
j the Farm. Their daughter, Marget,
j whom they lost recently, graduated
from Stanford in 1932, a member of
j Cap and Gown.
On the way out, he again pointed
; proudly at his herbarium, his rows
jof cases. We mentioned the large
cardboard boxes on top of (he cases.
"Those are what we call the de
i pression files, since we haven't been
j able to afford others." he said with
another chuckle.

Gilia Abramsii — it's a flowering
plant and it took its scientific name
from Professor Loßoy Abrams,
Stanford botanist and director of the
Natural History Museum.
Professor Abrams' heart interest
is the Dudley Herbarium, which to
you means a room where dried and
pressed plants are filed. He proudly
I pointed out his wards, close to 100
cases filled with specimens which
number about 260,000 mounted ones
and about 100,000 unmounted.
The modest professor graduated
from the Farm in '99.
I CAME AS JUNIOR
"And believe it or not, I came in
here as a junior from U.5.C.," he
said with a smile. "But that was be

From here he moved to the Uni

Columbia, and in 1905 to the larg
est herbarium in the world, the
Smithsonian Institute in Washing
ton, as assistant curator of plants.

Graduate Study Board, Executive
Committee, and Student Affairs
Committee, the professor last year
acted as president of the Pacifiic di
vision of the Botanical Society of
America, which held a conference
on the Farm last summer.
"Of course we did read some sci

entific papers, but (he meeting was
men whose material we had been
more of a get-together of all (he
using," he explained. "Our situa
tion was similar to what Borah said
i about President Roosevelt. 'He can
make me believe anything. If I
want the truth, I've got to read it.'
So we didn't read many scientific
papers."
Professor Abrams' particular field
of study comes under the head of
Forest Botany, which includes
flowering plants, with the emphasis
on trees and shrubs.
! Auto field trips usually to Yose-
I mite is another innovation instituted
by the kindly professor since the
roads have become good. About 12
to 20 students make (his scientific
jaunt (o study (he trees and tree
| bells. The professor calls it the "de
luxe botany trip in the U.S."
WORKING ON BOOK
You couldn't count the papers and
pamphlets he's written on your
i hands and toes. He has also stepped
into (he book field wi(h a three
edition book, "Los Angeles Flora,"
and another called, "Trees and
j Shrubs of Southern California." At
i present he is working on the third
I volume of a series called "Illustrated
j Flora of the Pacific Coast. He
I pointed out a six-inch pile of manu-
I scripts by way of explanation.
Strictly a Stanford family, the
professor met Mrs. Abrams here on
j the Farm. Their daughter, Marget,
j whom they lost recently, graduated
from Stanford in 1932, a member of
j Cap and Gown.
On the way out, he again pointed
; proudly at his herbarium, his rows
jof cases. We mentioned the large
cardboard boxes on top of (he cases.
"Those are what we call the de
i pression files, since we haven't been
j able to afford others." he said with
another chuckle.

Gilia Abramsii — it's a flowering
plant and it took its scientific name
from Professor Loßoy Abrams,
Stanford botanist and director of the
Natural History Museum.
Professor Abrams' heart interest
is the Dudley Herbarium, which to
you means a room where dried and
pressed plants are filed. He proudly
I pointed out his wards, close to 100
cases filled with specimens which
number about 260,000 mounted ones
and about 100,000 unmounted.
The modest professor graduated
from the Farm in '99.
I CAME AS JUNIOR
"And believe it or not, I came in
here as a junior from U.5.C.," he
said with a smile. "But that was be
fore they played football."
From here he moved to the Uni
versity of Idaho, back here, then to
Columbia, and in 1905 to the larg
est herbarium in the world, the
Smithsonian Institute in Washing
ton, as assistant curator of plants.
In 1900, just after the earthquake,
he returned to the Farm as an as
sistant professor. He wasn't sure
the exact year lhat he was made a
full professor but it was "long
enough ago."
INVESTIGATES HAY FEVER
Still modest, the professor would
give no scientific names but he esti
mated that he has discovered 25 to
30 new species of plants—a lot. of
hunting. In addition to the Gilia
Abramsii, he has had two other
plants named after him, the Gilia
Royalis—taken from his first name
and Abramsia, which is a flora grow
ing in the Fiji Islands.
"In addition to my other work,
j I've been doing some botanical hay
j fever investigation for the Southern
I Pacific Hospital," he continued. "I've
| been determining when and where

hay-fever-causing plants bloom. In
cidentally, around this region in
spring, rye grass is the biggest cause
of hay fever, and weeds and some
trees get in their work."
"And the golden rod isn't so bad
as they say. There's practically
none around here."
