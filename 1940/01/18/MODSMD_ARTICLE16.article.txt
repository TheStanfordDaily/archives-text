# Eight Final Bouts Carded For All-University Boxing Tournament at 8 o'Clock
## Hugh Gallarnean, Don Grant Tangle In Heavyweight Feature; Seven Varsity Favored to Cop Titles 
### PAT NOWELL 
Haulers for the All-University championships square oIT tonight at X
o'clock in Encina Pavilion in a card that promises plenty of fast, exciting,
bouts. Admission is free with student body cards.
Coach Clayton Frye and his assistant. Bill Wilber. announced last night
that all contestants are in good physical condition and that upsets arc;

liable to be plentiful in spite of tho
number of varsity men competing.
In the heavyweight feature, Hugh
Gallarneau meets Don Grant. Gal
larneau will pit his speed and expe
rience against the heavier Grant.
Grant, although only a sophomore,
has improved tremendously each
time out. and may have a surprise or
two for his foe.
BOTH ARE SOUTHPAWS
Grant is in good physical condi
tion, and is a tough, willing fighter.
Both men, interestingly enough,
are natural southpaws who fight;
from a right-handed or normal
stance. This will definitely be a
battle of left hands.
At 175 pounds, there will be a
brawl which Frye thinks may be
the best of the evening. Ed Stein
will match the skill acquired in
varsity experience against the ter
rific punching of novice winner
Jack Elliott. Elliott is another comer.
In his three novice tourney fights he
simply continued throwing haymak
ers until his opponents crumpled.
PUNCHES HARI)
His boxing ability has been im
proving with practice, but he will
need all his newly acquired skill if
he hopes to land on Slein. Stein is
a mean puncher in his own right.
The surprising Bobby Oakford will
pit his aggressive, hooking style
against the southpaw stance of Doug
Grant in the 165-pound division.
According to Frye and Wilber, Oak
ford's style is particularly suited to
trouble the unorthodox Grant. But
Grant's two years of varsity experi
ence is a tremendous factor in his
favor.
Oakford's surprise dbcision over
Stein in the preliminary of tills divi
sion still has boxing circles buzzing.
There are those who staunchly as
sert that his improvement, coupled
with his style, will be enough to
swing the tide in his favor.
OLD HEADS TANGLE
Two old heads tangle in the 155-
pound class. Tom Mac Michael was
a mainstay of last year's varsity
squad. Jimmy McCloud, although
he has never fought for the varsity,
has been knocking around in nov
ice and All-U tournaments for
three yearsâ€”interspersed with spas
modic seiges of gym workouts un
der Frye.
During (his time he has become
good enough to cinch himself a berth
on the varsity if he chooses to give
up baseball and concentrate on box
ing. Both men are ring-wise, ag
gressive, and good punchers with
either hand. This will be one of
the best and closest scraps of the
evening.
The 135-pound go will be another
corker. John Wilson won the All-U
tourney last year and went on to
the varsity. Blair Hyde, track star,
is said by Frye to be the fastest
lighter he has seen in three years of
coaching Stanford boxers. Hyde has
had considerable experience in fights
at San Mateo Junior College and
won his novice bout, so he will not
Ix l lacking in experience. This
shows every indication of being one
<>1 those close ones that has the
crowd battling among themselves.
At 145 pounds, Jim Potts meets
Frank Hewitt, another varsityman.
At first glance this might seem one
sided. But Potts is by no means a
pushovei. A senior, he has been
trying for four years to get in shape
lor a tournament, but fluctuating
weight and uniortunate illness have
kept him inactive. However, he has
a great deal of gym experience, and
is finally in shape for his best effort.
KINSLEY MAY FIGHT BERG
George Linsley has tentatively
been recruited to oppose Veteran
Bruce Berg at 127 pounds. How
ever, there are several complicating
factors, not the least important of
which is that he and Berg are room
mates. There may be a last-minute
substitution or withdrawal in this
event.
The 120-pounders are having a
rematch. Terry Green has been
working with grim determination,
hoping to reverse Ted Doe's novice
decision over him.
Admission is 50 cents to non
holders of student body cards.
Holders ol high school and junior
college student body cards will be
admitted for 25 cents.
All contestants are requested to
weigh in with Coach Frye before 4
o clock tomorrow afternoon.
