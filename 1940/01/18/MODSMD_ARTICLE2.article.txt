# Italy Stabs Allies' Boast Of Success
## Fascist Leader Puts Black Shirts Hack In 'War Threat' Spot 
### United Press 
Italy told the world Wednesday
that Fascism may "at any moment"
take up arms in the European war,
and also assailed British and French
efforts to win Italy's friendship. The
warning came from General Ettore
Muti, secretary general of the Fas
cist party, as Great Britain reported
that the Allied blockade already was
more effective than after two years
of the World War.
Virginio Gayda, who often speaks
for the Italian Foreign Office, said
in the Gornale d'ltalia that Muti's
speech "may be a surprise to artful
interpreters beyond the frontiers,"
an obvious reference to Britain and
France.
ITALY MAY FIGHT
"We must not sleep in the illusion
that Italy's present stand regarding
the conflict will be perpetual," Muti
said. "Fascist Italy might find itself
at any moment faced with the neces
sity and duty of taking up arms."
Fighting fronts in both Western
Europe and Finland were immobi
lized for the time being by extreme
cold.
No rumors of "imminent develop
ments" in Belgium's relations with
her belligerent neighbors spread, in
cluding assertions by usually reli
able but unofficial quarters that a
German attack had been scheduled
for Wednesday or Thursday.
CALM GREETS REPORT
All of these rumors and reports
met with calm silence in official
quarters and there was no indication
what the "imminent developments"
might be, should they occur. But
residents close to the frontiers were
warned to be ready to evacuate if
warning sirens and bells were
sounded.
French military quarters in Paris
insisted that the Germans had again
massed 70 divisions—about 1,000,000
troops—along the Dutch and Bel
gian frontiers.
In Sweden the Riksdag was thrown
into an uproar when Richard J.
Sandler, until recently Foreign Min
ister, demanded that Swedish troops
be sent to Finland's Aland Islands
in order to better secure their neu
trality.
PI.ANT MINES
From the main islands Soviet
bombers could reach Stockholm
within half an hour if Russia should
seize the archipelago. The Aland
waters have been planted with mines
since the start of the invasion of
Finland.
Finnish troops were reported driv
ing Russian forces back on the Salla
front above the Arctic Circle where
wounded men were freezing to death
almost immediately in temperatures
as low as 54 degrees below zero.

No rumors of "imminent develop
ments" in Belgium's relations with
her belligerent neighbors spread, in
cluding assertions by usually reli
able but unofficial quarters that a
German attack had been scheduled
for Wednesday or Thursday.
CALM GREETS REPORT
All of these rumors and reports
met with calm silence in official
quarters and there was no indication
what the "imminent developments"
might be, should they occur. But
residents close to the frontiers were
warned to be ready to evacuate if
warning sirens and bells were
sounded.
French military quarters in Paris
insisted that the Germans had again
massed 70 divisions—about 1,000,000
troops—along the Dutch and Bel
gian frontiers.
In Sweden the Riksdag was thrown
into an uproar when Richard J.
Sandler, until recently Foreign Min
ister, demanded that Swedish troops
be sent to Finland's Aland Islands
in order to better secure their neu
trality.
PI.ANT MINES
From the main islands Soviet
bombers could reach Stockholm
within half an hour if Russia should
seize the archipelago. The Aland
waters have been planted with mines
since the start of the invasion of
Finland.
Finnish troops were reported driv
ing Russian forces back on the Salla
front above the Arctic Circle where
wounded men were freezing to death
almost immediately in temperatures
as low as 54 degrees below zero.
Italy told the world Wednesday
that Fascism may "at any moment"
take up arms in the European war,
and also assailed British and French
efforts to win Italy's friendship. The
warning came from General Ettore
Muti, secretary general of the Fas
cist party, as Great Britain reported
that the Allied blockade already was
more effective than after two years
of the World War.
Virginio Gayda, who often speaks
for the Italian Foreign Office, said
in the Gornale d'ltalia that Muti's
speech "may be a surprise to artful
interpreters beyond the frontiers,"
an obvious reference to Britain and
France.
ITALY MAY FIGHT
"We must not sleep in the illusion
that Italy's present stand regarding
the conflict will be perpetual," Muti
said. "Fascist Italy might find itself
at any moment faced with the neces
sity and duty of taking up arms."
Fighting fronts in both Western
Europe and Finland were immobi
lized for the time being by extreme
cold.
