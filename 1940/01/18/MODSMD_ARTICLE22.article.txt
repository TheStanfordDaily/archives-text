# Economy Bloc Shouts Down O'Connor's "Pork' Item
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 (UP). —The economy drive in Congress sur
vived its first major test today when the House noisily shouted down a
Democratic attempt to write a 522.000.000 "pork" item into the 5i.100.000,000
Independent Offices Appropriation Bill.
Virtually all Republicans and most Democrats voted against the pro-

posal, sponsored by Rep. James
O'Connor. D., Mont., which would
have increased the appropriation for
federal buildings and post offices
from $15,000,000 to $37,000,000. There
was no record vote.
Even O'Connor's argument—a po
tent one in an election year—that
constituents would regard Congress
men as derelict in their duty if they
did not vote funds for post office
construction, did not dent the econ
omy front. Chairman Clifton A.
Woodrum, D„ Va.. of the appropria
tions committee in charge of the
measure, contended that "this is not
the time for such a program and
anyway we haven't got the money."
He was so encouraged by the ob
vious strength displayed by economy
forces that he predicted the entire
$94,492.1 GG slashes from budget esti
mates for independent offices during
the fiscal year beginning July 1,
would be approved. This saving
would bring to nearly $102,000,000
economies made by the House so
far this session.
The most serious threat to the in
dependent offices bill lies in a fight
led by Chairman Schuyler Bland, D.,
Va., of the Merchant Marine and
Fisheries Committee, to restore
$75,000,000 cut from the Maritime
Commission budget. He told the
House today that the entire $200,-
000,000 recommended in the budget
was needed for national defense
and promotion of foreign commerce.

asked today by Governor Clarence
D. Martin.

MOSCOW, Thurs., Jan. 17 (UP).
—The Presidium of the Supreme
Soviet has awarded the Order of
the Red Banner to the Red Army's
19th Infantry regiment for "exem
plary execution of battle tasks"
against Finnish troops, it was an
nounced today.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 17 (UP). —The economy drive in Congress sur
vived its first major test today when the House noisily shouted down a
Democratic attempt to write a 522.000.000 "pork" item into the 5i.100.000,000
Independent Offices Appropriation Bill.
Virtually all Republicans and most Democrats voted against the pro-

posal, sponsored by Rep. James
O'Connor. D., Mont., which would
have increased the appropriation for
federal buildings and post offices
from $15,000,000 to $37,000,000. There
was no record vote.
Even O'Connor's argument—a po
tent one in an election year—that
constituents would regard Congress
men as derelict in their duty if they
did not vote funds for post office
construction, did not dent the econ
omy front. Chairman Clifton A.
Woodrum, D„ Va.. of the appropria
tions committee in charge of the
measure, contended that "this is not
the time for such a program and
anyway we haven't got the money."
He was so encouraged by the ob
vious strength displayed by economy
forces that he predicted the entire
$94,492.1 GG slashes from budget esti
mates for independent offices during
the fiscal year beginning July 1,
would be approved. This saving
would bring to nearly $102,000,000
economies made by the House so
far this session.
The most serious threat to the in
dependent offices bill lies in a fight
led by Chairman Schuyler Bland, D.,
Va., of the Merchant Marine and
Fisheries Committee, to restore
$75,000,000 cut from the Maritime
Commission budget. He told the
House today that the entire $200,-
000,000 recommended in the budget
was needed for national defense
and promotion of foreign commerce.
