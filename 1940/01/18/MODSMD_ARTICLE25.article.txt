BEST FEMININE screen performance for 1939 goes to vivacious
Vivien Leigh for her interpretation of Scarlett O'Hara in the much
publicized "Gone With the Wind." Miss Leigh was selected by
New York film critics. The same critics chose "Wuthering
Heights," starring Laurence Olivier, as best picture of the year.


CONSIDERED the world's
most potent agent for peace
is Pope Pius XI, whose latest
move has been to confer with
King Victor Emmanuel of
Italy on diplomatic maneu
vers, yet unknown to polit
ical speculators. Current con
jectures link President Roose
velt and Pope Pius in a col
laborated effort for peace. In
corroboration of this was the
appointment of Myron Tay
lor, industrial tycoon, as
United States representative
to the Vatican.


MOST PHOTOGRAPHED fire
1 in recent days was at Minne-
I apolis, Minn., where an un
controllable blaze completely
destroyed 45-year-old Marl
| borough Apartment Hotel.
Sub-zero weather was a dis
tinct handicap to the firefight
ers and was largely respon
' sible for the large loss of
lives. Toll was 18 known
dead, 23 severely injured,
and a few unaccounted for.
Residents, awakened, leaped
from windows. In this scene,
ice-coated firemen take down
I tarpaulin-wrapped body of a
1 fire victim.


FIRST OFFICIAL ACT of Sir
John Reich, new British Minister
of Information, was to refuse to
see newspapermen.


SOMEWHERE along Amer
ica's Western Front the larg
est joint army and navy
peacetime maneuvers in Unit
ed States history are getting
under way. Because of "cen
sorship" invoked to further
stimulate actual wartime con
ditions, complete details
about these pictures are not
available. But the charging
troops in the upper scene
and the machine gun detach
ment, poised in lower photo,
are in the "Blue" force de
fending vital west coast mili
tary objectives from attack of
the "Black" force. Scores of
naval vessels are convoying
"invaders" from various coast
cities. Decisive battle will
probably be fought in the
Monterey, Calif., area.

Sub-zero weather was a dis
tinct handicap to the firefight
ers and was largely respon

dead, 23 severely injured,

SOMEWHERE along Amer

est joint army and navy
peacetime maneuvers in Unit
ed States history are getting
under way. Because of "cen
sorship" invoked to further
stimulate actual wartime con
ditions, complete details
about these pictures are not
available. But the charging
troops in the upper scene
and the machine gun detach
ment, poised in lower photo,
are in the "Blue" force de
fending vital west coast mili
tary objectives from attack of
the "Black" force. Scores of
naval vessels are convoying
"invaders" from various coast
cities. Decisive battle will
probably be fought in the
Monterey, Calif., area.

BEST FEMININE screen performance for 1939 goes to vivacious

Italy on diplomatic maneu
vers, yet unknown to polit
ical speculators. Current con
jectures link President Roose
velt and Pope Pius in a col
laborated effort for peace. In
corroboration of this was the
appointment of Myron Tay
lor, industrial tycoon, as
United States representative
to the Vatican.
