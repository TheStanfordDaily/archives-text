# A.T.O.'s Crush Chi Psis, 35-5
## Defending Champions Off to Fast Start 
### 
A.T.0., last year's defending
champions, looked good again as
they pushed over Chi P.si, 35 to 5.
The A.T.O. defense was especially
good as they held their opponents
to no field goals. Larsen with 8,
Bhiston with 9, and Koch with 10
led the A.T.O. forces.
The Zetes powered over El Tigre
in a very smooth game 29 to 17.
Stan Graff and Jim Groves played
steady ball for the winners, but
Cartwright of El Tigre took high
point honors with 8 points.
Beta Theta Pi ran all over Los
Arcos, mostly because of the sharp
shooting of Gone Kern at guard, who
pushed through 16 points.
Don Selby led the smooth Delta
Chi five to a 22 to 17 overtime vic
tory, scoring 9 points. Sequoia
thundered their way to a 35 to 9
victory over the disorganized A.T.O.
second team. Although the game
was not a close one, it provided
thrills in sufficiency for the few fans
who came out for the 'mural tilts.
