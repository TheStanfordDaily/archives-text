### JERRY MAYER 
SOME MORE PRAISE
FOR SHAUGHNESSY
It seems that in whichever direc
! tion one turns he continues to come
in contact with newspaper appro
bation for Clark Shaughnessy, Stan-
I ford's newly-acquired football coach.
I It has been a gradual process that
started slowly, and has since built
up to almost unbelievable propor
: tions.
When Shaughnessy was first nam
ed as Tiny Thomhill's successor,
most of the papers featured the dis
content of alumni factions who were
supporting other men for the post.
Then gradually the laudations for
the new mentor started to pour in.
For the past week, almost every
newspaper on the Coast has been
carrying column upon column of
praise for the man in whose hands
rests Stanford's future on the grid
iron. But what have the papers
from the Midwest got to say about
Shaughnessy?
For the pasl seven years.
Shaughnessy's losing teams have
y been a blot on the football es
| cutcheon of that section of the
country. Do the sports columnists
j of the Big Ten cities consider
! Shaughnessy an inferior coach on
i the basis of his record at Chi-
I cago?
j We have at hand a couple of
: columns clipped from Middle
j Western newspapers, and if they
consider Shaughnessy a poor
coach you'd never know it.
I>ick Cullum of the Minneapolis
Times-Tribune says of Stanford's
new grid coach:
"Shaughnessy is not only a mas
ter coach. He is a person of supe-
I rior qualities. He has character and
ideals and friendliness and all the
qualities that will make the Big Ten
I miss him. . . .
i "When we speak of master coaches
' we speak of the men who originate
, the stuff the others take over—the
i advanced thinkers.
"Nobody now active has originated
more basic football than Shaugh
j nessy. . . *
"There are fine coaches in the Pa
j cific Coast Conference, but it is not
I a slur upon any of them to say
I that, from the moment he reports
for work, Shaughnessy will be the
| best of the lot."
<> * *
Advancing a unique viewpoint,
John P. Carmichael suggests in the
Chicago Daily News that if "(Stan
ford) had any doubts as to Clark's
abilities or fitness for the job they
, must have been dissipated, by the
reflection that (Chicago), after all,
I fired the team, not the coach, to end
the strain of. successive defeats."

Further, Carmichael quotes George
Halas, owner-coach of the powerful
Chicago Bears professional football
team, as follows:
"Shaughnessy has ... a flair for
play-designing which stamps him as
without peer among the country's
coaches. He is a master, second to
none, in the use of the forward pass.
Stanford will find it is getting a man
who can combine the spectacular
and the effective to a superlative
degree."
The opinion is oftentimes ex
pressed of late that Shaughnessy
isn't getting a fair break, what with
all this publicity. Fans will expect
and demand nothing less than a
Rose Bowl team his first year, 'tis
said.
I doubt very much whether
anyone who knows anything at all
about football will expect such a
remarkable inaugural season for
Shaughnessy. The Bay Region is a
section of the country where one
finds more intelligent sports fans
than in almost any part of the
land.
In my opinion, all the new
"headman" will have lo do to in
stall himself in their favor is to
turn out a well-coached, alert,
and colorful eleven — and win a
few games—this year.
He will have the material for that
much; he won't have the material
for a Rose Bowl eleven come Jan. 1,
1941. I doubt whether any thinking
fan expects Shaughnessy to turn
out a world-beater his first year, or
even in his first two or three sea
sons.
But, maybe after that . . . ?

and demand nothing less than a
Rose Bowl team his first year, 'tis
said.
I doubt very much whether
anyone who knows anything at all
about football will expect such a
remarkable inaugural season for
Shaughnessy. The Bay Region is a
section of the country where one
finds more intelligent sports fans
than in almost any part of the
land.
In my opinion, all the new
"headman" will have lo do to in
stall himself in their favor is to
turn out a well-coached, alert,
and colorful eleven — and win a
few games—this year.
He will have the material for that
much; he won't have the material
for a Rose Bowl eleven come Jan. 1,
1941. I doubt whether any thinking
fan expects Shaughnessy to turn
out a world-beater his first year, or
even in his first two or three sea
sons.
But, maybe after that . . . ?
SOME MORE PRAISE
FOR SHAUGHNESSY
It seems that in whichever direc
! tion one turns he continues to come
in contact with newspaper appro
bation for Clark Shaughnessy, Stan-
I ford's newly-acquired football coach.
I It has been a gradual process that
started slowly, and has since built
up to almost unbelievable propor
: tions.
When Shaughnessy was first nam
ed as Tiny Thomhill's successor,
most of the papers featured the dis
content of alumni factions who were
supporting other men for the post.
Then gradually the laudations for
the new mentor started to pour in.
For the past week, almost every
newspaper on the Coast has been
carrying column upon column of
praise for the man in whose hands
rests Stanford's future on the grid
iron. But what have the papers
from the Midwest got to say about
Shaughnessy?
For the pasl seven years.
Shaughnessy's losing teams have
y been a blot on the football es
| cutcheon of that section of the
country. Do the sports columnists
j of the Big Ten cities consider
! Shaughnessy an inferior coach on
i the basis of his record at Chi-
I cago?
j We have at hand a couple of
: columns clipped from Middle
j Western newspapers, and if they
consider Shaughnessy a poor
coach you'd never know it.
I>ick Cullum of the Minneapolis
Times-Tribune says of Stanford's
new grid coach:
"Shaughnessy is not only a mas
ter coach. He is a person of supe-
I rior qualities. He has character and
ideals and friendliness and all the
qualities that will make the Big Ten
I miss him. . . .
i "When we speak of master coaches
' we speak of the men who originate
, the stuff the others take over—the
i advanced thinkers.
"Nobody now active has originated
more basic football than Shaugh
j nessy. . . *
"There are fine coaches in the Pa
j cific Coast Conference, but it is not
I a slur upon any of them to say
I that, from the moment he reports
for work, Shaughnessy will be the
| best of the lot."
<> * *
Advancing a unique viewpoint,
John P. Carmichael suggests in the
Chicago Daily News that if "(Stan
ford) had any doubts as to Clark's
abilities or fitness for the job they
, must have been dissipated, by the
reflection that (Chicago), after all,
I fired the team, not the coach, to end
the strain of. successive defeats."

Further, Carmichael quotes George
Halas, owner-coach of the powerful
Chicago Bears professional football
team, as follows:
"Shaughnessy has ... a flair for
play-designing which stamps him as
without peer among the country's
coaches. He is a master, second to
none, in the use of the forward pass.
Stanford will find it is getting a man
who can combine the spectacular
and the effective to a superlative
degree."
The opinion is oftentimes ex
pressed of late that Shaughnessy
isn't getting a fair break, what with
all this publicity. Fans will expect
and demand nothing less than a
Rose Bowl team his first year, 'tis

Advancing a unique viewpoint,
John P. Carmichael suggests in the
Chicago Daily News that if "(Stan
ford) had any doubts as to Clark's
abilities or fitness for the job they
, must have been dissipated, by the
reflection that (Chicago), after all,
I fired the team, not the coach, to end
the strain of. successive defeats."

Further, Carmichael quotes George
Halas, owner-coach of the powerful
Chicago Bears professional football
team, as follows:
"Shaughnessy has ... a flair for
play-designing which stamps him as
without peer among the country's
coaches. He is a master, second to
none, in the use of the forward pass.
Stanford will find it is getting a man
who can combine the spectacular
and the effective to a superlative
degree."
The opinion is oftentimes ex
pressed of late that Shaughnessy
isn't getting a fair break, what with
all this publicity. Fans will expect
and demand nothing less than a
Rose Bowl team his first year, 'tis
said.
I doubt very much whether
anyone who knows anything at all
about football will expect such a
remarkable inaugural season for
Shaughnessy. The Bay Region is a
section of the country where one
finds more intelligent sports fans
than in almost any part of the
land.
In my opinion, all the new
"headman" will have lo do to in
stall himself in their favor is to
turn out a well-coached, alert,
and colorful eleven — and win a
few games—this year.
He will have the material for that
much; he won't have the material
for a Rose Bowl eleven come Jan. 1,
1941. I doubt whether any thinking
fan expects Shaughnessy to turn
out a world-beater his first year, or
even in his first two or three sea
sons.
But, maybe after that . . . ?
SOME MORE PRAISE
FOR SHAUGHNESSY
It seems that in whichever direc
! tion one turns he continues to come
in contact with newspaper appro
bation for Clark Shaughnessy, Stan-
I ford's newly-acquired football coach.
I It has been a gradual process that
started slowly, and has since built
up to almost unbelievable propor
: tions.
When Shaughnessy was first nam
ed as Tiny Thomhill's successor,
most of the papers featured the dis
content of alumni factions who were
supporting other men for the post.
Then gradually the laudations for
the new mentor started to pour in.
For the past week, almost every
newspaper on the Coast has been
carrying column upon column of
praise for the man in whose hands
rests Stanford's future on the grid
iron. But what have the papers
from the Midwest got to say about
Shaughnessy?
For the pasl seven years.
Shaughnessy's losing teams have
y been a blot on the football es
| cutcheon of that section of the
country. Do the sports columnists
j of the Big Ten cities consider
! Shaughnessy an inferior coach on
i the basis of his record at Chi-
I cago?
j We have at hand a couple of
: columns clipped from Middle
j Western newspapers, and if they
consider Shaughnessy a poor
coach you'd never know it.
I>ick Cullum of the Minneapolis
Times-Tribune says of Stanford's
new grid coach:
"Shaughnessy is not only a mas
ter coach. He is a person of supe-
I rior qualities. He has character and
ideals and friendliness and all the
qualities that will make the Big Ten
I miss him. . . .
i "When we speak of master coaches
' we speak of the men who originate
, the stuff the others take over—the
i advanced thinkers.
"Nobody now active has originated
more basic football than Shaugh
j nessy. . . *
"There are fine coaches in the Pa
j cific Coast Conference, but it is not
I a slur upon any of them to say
I that, from the moment he reports
for work, Shaughnessy will be the
| best of the lot."
