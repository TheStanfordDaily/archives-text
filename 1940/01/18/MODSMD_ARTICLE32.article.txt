# Frosh Cagers To Meet Menlo
## Voss May Be Out Of Tilt with Injury 
### 
Although they haven't been work- 1
ing too hard this week due to a j
slight epidemic of upset stomachs
since last week-end, the Stanford j
freshman basketball team now ap- i
pears to be in good shape lor their [
games with Menlo Junior College j
and Palo Alto High School this j
week-end, with one exception. That '
is Ed Voss, lofty center, who has |
been out of practce since he injured
an ankle in Monday's workout.
Coach Beebs Lee has been work- j
ing Ed Stamm in Voss' spot and is I
confident that the big Portland boy \
will fill the bill in fine fashion. It is j
quite probable that Stamm will!
start both games this week-end. j
since Voss will not see much action |
in either lilt unless he gets a chance j
to practice this afternoon on the new J
offense which Lee has designed fori
the Menlo contest.
Coach Lee has decided to put '
Stamm on big Jim Needam, high
scoring Menlo center, with hopes
that Ed will keep down Needam's â– 
scoring as well as balance the lat- |
ter's effectiveness on the back- |
boards.
Just who will guard Tommy La
thos, leading scorer for the Oaks and j
all-J.C. forward last season, Lee j
has not decided as yet, but the ;
chances are it will be John Eikle- j
man or Walt Funabiki. This after
noon's practice will feature defense j
against the Menlo offense, as coached !
by Roy Hughes, which is somewhat
similar to the attack used hy George
Washington High School and Santa j
Clara University.
Most of the time this week has j
been spent on the new offense. The
boys on the team seem to like the
new scheme of attack and have 1 een
making it look very good in prac
tice, according to Lee.
