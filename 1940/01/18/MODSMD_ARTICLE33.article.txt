## JERRY MAYER, Sports Editor Enthusiasm on Indian Squad Swings High for Cal Game Season Record Gives Cards Edge In Basketball Tilt Tomorrow Night 
### 
Just to look at Coach Everett :
Doan's cagers out there in the Pa- j
vilion every afternoon is enough to i
make the betting gentry think twice ;
before establishing any favorites to- j
morrow night.
Cal's the team the Indians are
working for. It's the first of a strung- j
out four-game Eig Basketball Series >
with the towering Bears.
The initial game means a lot to
both clubs. Stanford is tested so far
to the extent of six Eastern games
on their barnstorming tour and two
games last week with U.C.L.A. But
whether their tests were as severe
as those which Cal encountered on
its trip remains in balance.
BI(i TEST i OR CAL
The big test will be for Cal to set
if they can make a successful come
back against the Indians after hav
ing suffered so many defeats since
leaving Berkeley, Dec. 23. To start
out the Southern Division race with
twin losses to the Trojans did their
cause no good, while Stanford is ofl
to their best start in a couple of
years with two victories.
The Cal test will determine just
what sort of a game the Cards will
be playing from now on in. Morale
around the practice floor is high to
such an extent that it will take a
fast-moving Bear team to offset the
enthusiasm of the locals.
BASKET SHOOTING GOOD
Team members aren't predicting
anything, but they do know that they
have a home floor and crowd in their
favor. They also know that the
Bears are only three times winners
in their last 14 games, and it takes
quite a bit of time to recuperate from
such records.

In practices the past two after
noons, Don Williams and Fordy
Anderson have put on some excellent
exhibitions of basket shooting. Da
vidson, Cowden, and Taylor are
working into a smoother outfit every
time they take Ihe floor.
There's quite a bit to beating a
team as large as the Bears, but Stan
ford thinks that it has the stuff to
turn the trick. At least Coach Nibs
Price and his Bears will see a pol
ished outfit Friday which has a lot
of clever plays worked into an of
fense that will cause headaches ga
lore before the four-game series is
completed.
