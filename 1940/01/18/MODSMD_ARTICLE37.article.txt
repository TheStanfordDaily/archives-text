# The 						Stanford Peerage
## 
### 
RECENTLY a San Francisco sports writer,
running short of warmed-over copy about
the Stanford football coaching situation, turned
his inexpert attention to the Stanford student
body in an effort to fill out his reguired 20
inches.
For several paragraphs he talked about the
"landed gentry —comprised mainly of boys and
girls who bring with them the metropolitan
atmosphere of towns like Visalia and Dinuba—
who consider fooball players declasse; sort of
hired men brought to the Farm to amuse them.
Discounting the writer's attempt at sarcasm,
anyone with an intimate knowledge of Stanford
life realizes that his statement about the stu
dents' attitude toward gridmen is absolutely
untrue.
The losing athlete is not the hero that the
winning man would be—no. But anyone who is
working his way through school, whether he
be a varsity letter man or a Phi Bete in chem
istry, holds the respect of every financially
independent Stanford student.
In order to stay in school and remain eli
gible a football player must have as good or
better mental eguipment than the rest of the
student body. At this University there is no
separate code of entrance reguirements for
athletes, nor are there any distinctions made in
academic work, despite the long hours reguired
for practice.
When the San Francisco columnist stated that
the "landed gentry" make a practice of socially
ostracizing football players, he conclusively
proved that he did not know what he was talk
ing about. Athletes, especially gridmen, more
than any other group are sought after by power
ful fraternities, those houses to which a pre
ponderance of students from wealthy families
belong.
But even these men, regardless of whether
they associate with football players or not,
cannot fairly be called the Stanford aristocracy.
Although it undoubtedly will be difficult for
the City commentator to realize it, there is no
such thing as social distinction on the Farm.
When a man enters Stanford, his respectable
ancestors and his family's income are forgot
ten, unless he insists on reminding people of
them —in which case he becomes a laughing
stock.
Once he is on the Farm, a man is judged on
the basis of his own merit and ability. If his
personality or his prowess will not sell him,
nothing else will.
When students talk about the weakening of
the democratic tradition, they are referring to
the growing enrollment, the increasing number
of transfer students who are ignorant of local
traditions, and the gigantic fleet of automobiles
which is leading social life away from the
campus. They do not mean that class distinc
tions are arising here or that the University is
being run by any exclusive cligue.
Despite the claims of the San Francisco sports
writer whose column is in guestion, there is no
such thing as a "landed gentry" at Stanford.
Hereafter, if he wants material on snobbery,
he had better take a look around his own home
town.
