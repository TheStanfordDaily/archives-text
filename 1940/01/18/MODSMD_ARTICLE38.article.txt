BACK in the old days when John L. Sullivan
was fighting around in rural barns trying
to keep one jump ahead of the police, and fight
promoters were classed with blackmailers and
gamblers, boxing was considered the dirtiest
sport since Rome knew Nero.
Then in 1927 Jack Dempsey fought Gene
Tunney in Philadelphia in the rain. The sheriff
had no trouble finding this fight; it was ad
vertised all over the country. And he came, but
not to arrest Tunney and Dempsey for being
illegal, but to keep an eye on the till—and the
31,000,000 in it.
And there were women there in the audience,
women wearing short skirts and Clara Bow
hats. Prize fighting had become legal, and it
was on its way to becoming respectable.
But it is still a dirty game, just as anything
where there is bin money at stake in qate re

ceipts and bets, is likely to be.
Yet boxing, essentially the same sport which
kept John L. perpetually in hot water and which
has made fortunes for Jack Dempsey and Joe
Louis, among others, is one of the cleanest
college sports today.
In college, boxing is sport for the sake of j
sport, with nothing ulterior at stake but a gold
award.
And at Stanford boxing is particularly clean;
not clean in a simply no-graft-and-corruption ;
way, but clean in the way it is handled as far -
as the men themselves are coached.
It is clean because of the way it is worked by
Clayton Frye. Here in the middle of his third
year at Stanford, going into the finals of his :
third University boxing tourney, his sixth intra
campus boxing card, he has not let a single
man be seriously injured.
But he has given the people who come to his
matches—and they do come, in steadily increas i
ing numbers—action. He has given them a
sport to watch which keeps them coming back.
He has taught his boxers how to fight, and then ;
let them show it.
So tonight, for a good show, for an evening
of fast action, for clean sport, go to the Pavilion |
and watch Stanford boxers win their golden
gloves.—D. J.

of fast action, for clean sport, go to the Pavilion |
and watch Stanford boxers win their golden
gloves.—D. J.
BACK in the old days when John L. Sullivan
was fighting around in rural barns trying
to keep one jump ahead of the police, and fight
promoters were classed with blackmailers and
gamblers, boxing was considered the dirtiest
sport since Rome knew Nero.
Then in 1927 Jack Dempsey fought Gene
Tunney in Philadelphia in the rain. The sheriff
had no trouble finding this fight; it was ad
vertised all over the country. And he came, but
not to arrest Tunney and Dempsey for being
illegal, but to keep an eye on the till—and the
31,000,000 in it.
And there were women there in the audience,
women wearing short skirts and Clara Bow
hats. Prize fighting had become legal, and it
was on its way to becoming respectable.
But it is still a dirty game, just as anything
where there is bin money at stake in qate re

ceipts and bets, is likely to be.
Yet boxing, essentially the same sport which
kept John L. perpetually in hot water and which
has made fortunes for Jack Dempsey and Joe
Louis, among others, is one of the cleanest
college sports today.
In college, boxing is sport for the sake of j
sport, with nothing ulterior at stake but a gold
award.
And at Stanford boxing is particularly clean;
not clean in a simply no-graft-and-corruption ;
way, but clean in the way it is handled as far -
as the men themselves are coached.
It is clean because of the way it is worked by
Clayton Frye. Here in the middle of his third
year at Stanford, going into the finals of his :
third University boxing tourney, his sixth intra
campus boxing card, he has not let a single
man be seriously injured.
But he has given the people who come to his
matches—and they do come, in steadily increas i
ing numbers—action. He has given them a
sport to watch which keeps them coming back.
He has taught his boxers how to fight, and then ;
let them show it.
So tonight, for a good show, for an evening
of fast action, for clean sport, go to the Pavilion |
and watch Stanford boxers win their golden
gloves.—D. J.
