### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
AT THE CAFE BALALAIKA
ILONA MASSEY unquestionably has a great deal of
sex appeal, so much sex appeal that one doesn't
have to listen to her singing. Nelson Eddy is also
pretty good, too, if you like Nelson Eddy. In short,
the picture "Balalaika" was fairly good entertain
ment.
But its interpretation of Russian history was with
out doubt the most absurd fairy tale ever written.
Hans Christen Anderson had best look to his laurels.
Hollywood's versions and perversions of history make
"Jack and the Bean Stalk" look like a physics text.
A good many people don't care much for the Com
munistic regime in Russia. The movie "Ninotchka,
for instance, made that fairly plain in a well-directed,
witty way. But on the other hand, most informed
people don't think the Czarist government in Russia
was exactly a copy of Moore's Utopia or Plato's
Republic.
But in "Balalaika" ihe Russian nobility, famous for
its parasitic indolence and cruelty to the peasants, is
painted as an oppressed class in society. One of them,
a cossack who was in the gentlemanly habit of tram
pling people under the hoofs of his well-groomed
horse, finally sinks to being a waiter in Paris. Fairly
dripping with sympathy, one of the ex-aristocrats
watches the "fallen" noble and softly murmurs, "How
sad! He once lost ten thousand acres in a gambling
debt."
Now there's a situation to make the hardest heart
bleed! And furthermore, it proves that this class
struggle business is all wrong. The Russian nobles
were oppressed by the Revolution. The oppressed
masses should include, then, not only the "workers"
and the "have-not nations," but the Russian nobility
as well.
Of course, this method of rewriting history does open
the field for any number of new twists. And Holly
wood will unquestionably notice that. They have al
ready pictured in "Marie Antoinette" the intriguing
notion that the French Revolution probably would
not have hapepned if the Duke of Orleans hadn't lied
about Marie Antoinette's necklace. Now the next fea
ture will probably show us that the boys who ran
the Inquisition were being persecuted for believing in
God.
After that startling triumph, Hollywood can go on
and show how the Pilgrims were intolerant of old King
James. And then in rapid succession: George Wash
ington was trying to regiment King George; the serfs
in the Middle Ages made it hell for the feudal barons;
and the Romans' gladiators were always taking advan
tage of those hungry lions in the arena.
So I think we can agree with the advertisements
that "Balalaika" really blazed new trails in screen
history. (And political history as well.)
Showing next, week: "A Poor Pile of Faggots," pro
duced by Samuel Goldwynâ€”telling how Joan of Arc
persecuted the burning-stake.
