# STUDENT SOUNDING BOARD

### 
r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
In view of the recent publicity received by the
A.S.U., and the controversy regarding policies and
attitudes of the local and national organizations, I
would like to make clear the outlook and purpose of
the Stanford Political Union.
Active for almost two years in promoting under
graduate interest in national questions, the Political
Union follows no pattern of political, economic, or
social philosophy, and makes no attempt to influence
opinion on or off this campus.
On the other hand the Political Union offers the
framework, and opportunity for the discussion of crit
ical. contemporary, and immediate questions. It is
in this aspect that the organization departs from the
practices of the A.S.U. The three groups within the
Political Union (Conservative. Liberal, and Labor)
reflect the views of their membership, and from this
divergence of opinion emanates the three cornered de
bate which, in fact, is the reason for the existence of
the organization.

I VIY PURPOSE in this communication is to stress
1 the fact that the Stanford Political Union is no
crusading group that seeks to condemn, reform, or
support anything or anybody. Ratherâ€”it can be ihe
sounding board for all undergraduate opinion on that
which is of general public interest.
It is only too obvious that undergraduate opinion
is not one-sided, but it is reasonable to observe that
the A.S.U. oflers but a single avenue for its expression.
If this should remain the condition on this campus it
might reasonably be termed deplorable.
It is in consequence of this that I should like to in
| dicate the ability of the machinery outlined above to
! satisfactorily reflect the ideas and opinions of Stan
j ford's entire undergraduate body.
Oliver Wyman.
President, Stanford Political Union
