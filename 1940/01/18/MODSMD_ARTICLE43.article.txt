# 'Gulliver's Travels' Lacks Disney's Deft Handling
## 
### 
"Gulliver's Travels," now showing at the Fox Stanford, is Paramount's
i entry in the Disney-dominated field of feature length cartoons. As a
j whole, it's a respectable competitor, hut lacks that deft handling that
| Donald Duck's creator seems to have.
The color is excellent, and producer Max Fleischer is to he complimented

j on a wise choice of material
| he picked Jessica Dragonette and j
j Lanny Ross for the voice doubles of
| Princess Glory and Prince David.
The story itself sticks moderately
close to Jonathan Swift's, with the
addition of a red-haired individual ,
aptly named "Gabby," King Bombo,
and the Three Spies. All the ter
rific sequences come in the first half I
of the production, though. "Gabby" '
flight through the woods ("There's
a giant on the beach.") and the sub
sequent capture of the giant are
notable. After that, things seem to
drag a bit, but the Three Spies are
good for a laugh until the very end.
It seemed to this department that'
Fleischer's Prince and Princess were
inferior in characterization to Dis
ney's, but the fault probably lies in
the technical difficulty of catching!
I fleeting human emotions in a car- |
toon character's face.
Tunes of the picture are by Rain- j
ger and Robin; "Faithful Forever" j
Ls one you've been hearing. Be sure
to watch for the excellent animation j
in the lantern-light sequences and |
the camera angles during the march j
to the beach.
The other feature is "Our Neigh- i
bors the Carters." Bring an extra
I handkerchief.â€”Littleboy
