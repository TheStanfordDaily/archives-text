### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
JVNGLAND'S fears of German
sabotage were not without basis,
♦he British Isle found out yesterday.
After three terrific explosions in a
nitro-glycerine shed of the Royal
Gunpowder factory at Waltham Ab
bey which kil'ed five workers, in
jured at least 30, and damaged
property within a six-mile radius,
Scotland Yard was investigating
Nazi activity in England. The Yard's
suspicion of sabotage was founded
on anonymous information furnished
authorities that "accidents might
happen" there and at other facto
ries.
High police officials conferred
for hours with factory heads and
questioned scores of workmen.
And another possible reason was
introduced—the blast might have
been plotted by terrorists of the
outlawed Irish Republican army.
At the hearings, officials found
out that three other attempts had
been made to damage the factory.
Hundred* of workmen were ques
tioned by government agents.
Even as the blast occurred, in the
heart of a government arms man
ufacturing district 12 miles north
of London, Scotland Yard detec
tives were investigating a suspect
ed plot to wreck the big plant.
* * * v
CO TERRIFIC were the explosions
k that doors were blown from their
hinges nine miles away from the
scene. England got such a rocking
that practically all the populace in
the neighborhood was sure that
Germany's "blitzkrieg" aerial at
tacks had started. Scotland Yard,
with much more efficiency than de
tective novels give them credit for,
was on the scene immediately after
the explosion. One of the Yard's
"big five" took charge of the inves
tigation. The G-men of Britain, the
famed C.1.D., were probing every
possible source of information about
the blast. A preliminary report al
ready has been sent to the govern
ment, probably to the ministry of
supply which is in charge of the
wartime output of the power factory.
The gun powder works cover a
seven-square-mile area with each
department isolated in a shed, the
sheds being separated by high pro
tective earthworks and fences of
blankets to break the force of ex
plosions and minimize the danger of
flying debris. Nevertheless, six sheds
were wrr ked in yesterday's explo
sions when gigantic steel girders
were lipped away and hurled 500
yards.
* *
r pWENTY-FIVE miles away the
explosions were • heard. But
work at the plant didn't halt. The
men were told to cany on with their
jobs and. despite the fact that tre
mendous damage was done, work
continued in undamaged parts of the
plant. Ambulances, air raid pre
cautions officers and demolition
squads concentrated at the scene of
the explosion. Everyone thought
that, when Ihe mighty column of
fire lept into the air above the fac
tory and a great blanket of smoke
carried 300 feet into the grey Eng
lish sky, a German air raid had
been staged. Hitler's skymen got
credit, for a few moments, for
something they hadn't done.
It's a significant fact that, only
yesterday, nearly 600,000 British
railroad employes were mustered
into an "anti-spy" army after re
ports of German sabotage plot
against railroads and utilities. Still
other speculations sifted around
informed London circles, connect
ing the blast with the terroristic
activities of the Irish Republicans
who have been responsible for re
cent bombings in the British capi
tal. Commons heard, before the
outbreak of the war, that they had
been organizing a gigantic plot to
wreck important English centers.
