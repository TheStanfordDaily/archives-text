eral days of interne cold had largely
immobilized operations. New diplo
matic moves, suspected sabotage,
further defense measures in the
Netherlands and a Russian apology
for violation of Sweden's neutrality
were other highlights of the day's
developments.
Five planes presumed to be Brit
ish bombed the German island of
Sylt of! the Jutland coast, a sea
plane base, in what appeared to be

THREE SHIPS SINK
On the sea a Norwegian steamer
wjis shelled and torpedoed by a
German submarine, and two other
merchant ships, one British and one

A 45-minute artillery barrage
broke the quiet of the Western
Front. German and French guns
blazed away but reports said the fire
was ineffective. A German attack in
the vicinity of Vosges Mountains
was repulsed by French troops and
several prisoners were taken.
The suspected sabotage involved
the British Royal Powder Plant on
the outskirts of London. Five per
sons were killed and 30 injured in
three blasts. It was reported that
three other attempts had been made
to damage the factory and that hun
dreds of workmen had been ques
tioned by government agents.
COMMERCIAL BLOW
Great Britain dealt American
commerce the; most severe financial
blow thus far in the European war
when it was announced in the
House of Commons that Turkish to
bacco purchases would supplant a
business of millions of dollars a year
with the United States.
It was believed on this side of the
Atlantic that the United States
would continue to contest the Brit

to interfere with American mails on
the high seas.
