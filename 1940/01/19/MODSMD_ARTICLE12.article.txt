# Atherton Clarifies New Coast Conference Laws; Farm 'Czar' Also Acts
## Sports Manager Says 'Firehouse Still in Loop' 
### DICK DUDMAN 
Stanford almost had its own
pocket-size edition of the Pacific
Coast Conference shake-up yester
day.
The Firehouse was the local Uni
versity of Southern California.
Andy Stojkovich, student intra
mural manager, was the local coun
terpart of Edwin N. Atherton, new
czar of the Coast Conference.
Muttered charges' of proselyting
and professionalism were every bit
as frequent on the Farm as are
similar charges leveled at coast col
leges and universities.
PURGE' SUSPECTED
Things came to a head last night
when the Firehouse boys decided
they were being purged from the
intramural program because they
were "too good." (Last quarter the
Firehouse team was undefeated
champion of the intramural football
schedule.)
Acting in unison —an old Fire
house custom — the boys collabo
rated on 'o stormy letters to The
Daily protesting against what they
termed "undisguised discrimination."
(The two letters appear on page 4
of this issue of The Daily.)
But Stojkovich punctured the
bubble of controversy later in the
evening when he denied that the
Firehouse was disqualified for intra
mural competition. Harry Wolter,
chairman of the intramural com
mittee, agreed, declaring that 'the
Firehouse inmates are entirely quali
fied to enter a track team spring
quarter, a particular point of con
troversy.
WHAT DID STOKIE SAY?
Firehouse inmates suspected a
purge because of a statement made
by Stojkovich when they tried two
weeks ago to sign up late for hand
ball. According to the fire laddies,
this statement ran something as
follows:
"Even if it were still time to sign
up, the Firehouse would be ineli
gible because they're not a living
group and because they have too
many good athletes."
Denying he threatened ineligi
bility, Stojkovich says he may have
told them they "look like a bunch
of all-stars."
'LOVE FEAST' PLANNED
Belligerence was on the wane last
night, and interested parties sched
uled a meeting for 3:30 o'clock to
day at the 8.A.C., Wolter, Stojko
vich, and the Firehouse boys to be in
attendance.
Even tomorrow's "love feast" can't
settle the whole business, however.
The following persons still feel as
follows:
The Row boys don't like their
absent brothers winning games for
the Firehouse.
Harry Wolter as baseball coach
doesn't like his mittmen playing in
intramural sports during baseball
season.
And the Firehouse boys don't like
walking up the Row and hearing the
brothers sneer, "Ya-a-a, you're in
e'igiblc."
