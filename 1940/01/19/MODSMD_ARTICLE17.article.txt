# 'Big Game' Cage Fives to Clash Here Tonight
## Stanford Has Team Strength; Price Five Offers Vets, Height 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Stanford over California? The
Bears over the Indians?
Right now it is a toss-up between
Coach Everett Dean's and Coach
Nibs Price's rival cagers, who meets
to decide the initial issue of their
strung-out series at 8 o'clock .to
night in the Pavilion.
'It has been nearly a sell-out so
that 3000 fanatics will sit in on
perhaps the most evenly matched
game (on paper) in five years.
BEARS TALL
Stanford has the organization —
clever, tricky, fast-breaking, sharp-

shooting cagers; California has the
strength of a tall, well organized,
and veteran quintet, to back itself
up.
However, no matter what has
been said or will be said regarding
the respective merits of the two
teams, they will have to stand on
their talents as of tonight. In all
probability Stanford stands the best
chance of capturing the opener.
California has just completed a dis
organized barnstorming tour, and it.
may be yet a week before Price
has last year's champs in shape to
give battle to any team on even
terms.
CARDS' CONFIDENT
No one figures on the towering
Bears to be set-ups tonight for the
confident Card cagers. The Bears
have in Big Bill Ogilvie, Bill Big
gerstaff, and Captain Wall. Bickerton
just the men to make things mighty
difficult should the Cards get off to
a fast start. Along with these men
are Morgan, Alameida, and Biles—
Cal's forwards, who have yet to get
started in their shooting. Once that
is regained the Bears have all that
it takes to give any conference lead
ers a battle.
BUT THAT SIZE!
It is the size of the Bears which
has Stanford followers worried. They
wonder whether the Indians will be
able to stand up under a rough and
tumble basketball game. One chief
problem will be to keep Cal's giants
from crashing through to pick up
loose balls and score set-ups.
Stanford will be disadvantaged in
height under the basket. Taylor is
the only one who can match Ogilvio'.s
or Biggerstaff's tremendous statures,
and so when Stanford is on the of
fensive. it will depend a great deal
upon how sharp Fordy Anderson's,
Don Williams', and Ken Davidson's
eyes are on their first shots at the
basket. Otherwise Ogilvie and Big
gerstaff will have a better chance of
