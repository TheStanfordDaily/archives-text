# G-Man Explains 'Entertainment,' Tuition Lawn
## 
### 
In order to clarify the new regu
lations concerning the proselyting
and subsidizing of athletes competing
for Pacific Coast Conference univer
sities, Edwin N. Atherton, newly
appointed commissioner of athletics,
yesterday released a statement in
terpreting the two most important
new rules.
The new legislation was passed aL
the annual winter meeting of the
Pacific Coast Conference, which was
held this year in Los Angeles during
the first week of January, as a result
of the 2,000,000-word survey con
ducted by Atherton on athlete* and
athletic conditions in the conference.
PROSELYTING LAW
The first rule interpreted by Ath
erton in his statement yesterday con
cerns proselyting, the rule itself
reading as follows:
"Except as specified herein, en
tertainment of high school or
junior college athletes by member'*
of the Conference or their repre
sentatives or alumni is forbidden.
Violation of this rule shall render
the athlete or athletes involved
ineligible at the institution whose
representatives or alumni are in
volved in the violation. This rule
shall not preclude entertainment
of such athletes by a Conference
institution on its own campus,
when they are present for the pur
pose of athletic competition with
the institution's own team."
The word "entertainment," ex
plains Atherton, includes banquet*,
week-end excursions and other out
ings, trips to visit college campuses,
complimentary tickets to athletic
contests and other events, and simi
lar means of influencing promising
athletes toward one particular in
stitution.
RECRUITING RULING
The following rule, which ex
tends the restrictions on recruiting,
carries the same penalty as the one
just quoted:
"Trips by athletic officials or
coaches for the purpose of re
cruiting are forbidden. When
athletic officials or coaches arc on
trips they must not interview high
school or junior college athlete*.
A visit to a high school or junior
college athlete or his family by
an athletic official or coach, un
less he is a personal friend, can
generally be interpreted only as
recruiting."
General misunderstanding also ex
ists, according to Atherton, concern
ing the following new rules regulat
ing subsidization of athletes:
SCHOLARSHIPS ALU)WEI)
"(I) Athletes arc permitted to re
ceive scholarships awarded by the
institution on a competitive scholas
tic basis in competition open to
athletes and non-athletes alike; (II)
loans made to a student by the in
stitution in which he is enrolled,
under regulations applicable to all
students alike; and (III) grants in
aid for the payment of tuition from
funds received by the institution,
not exceeding the amount agreed
upon by the Conference for thy
equalization of differentials in tui
lion between the member institu
tions."
However, amendments to the rules
provide: "(1) that such loans (as
under !I) and grants in aid (as under
III) shall be made by the student's
inst it'.it i< -1 on the basis of need, after
investigation and approval by the
regular committee for the granting
of such aid to all students, and (2)
that athletic participation shall not
be a condition for such aid."
The amendments further provide
that those grants in aid which are
authorized by the rules cannot be
made "(a) by the institution by
canceling the payment of tuition;
(2) out ot athletic. Associated Stu
dent or institutional funds, except
through competitive scholarships as
' pecified above.
The foregoing rules, as well as
others adopted by the Conference,
are not retroactive but do become
effective immediately, concluded
Atherton.
