# 'Sen. Borah Near Death,' Doctor Says
## Cerebral Hemorrhage Strikes 74-year-old Isolationist Leader 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 18 (UP).—
Son. William E. Borah, 74, veteran
Idaho Republican whose legislative
fights won him world renown,
fought a losing battle against death
tonight and his personal physician,
Dr. Worth Daniels, said there is
"still no hope whatever" that he
might recover.
Dr. Daniels reported at 9:25 p.m.
that the condition of the veteran
isolationist leader, who was stricken
with a cerebral hemorrhage early
Tuesday, was unchanged and that
he had had only a few moments of
consciousness since 1 p.m.
He said it appeared that death was
only a matter of hours.
CAPITAL MOURNS
The capital remained in a state of
semi-mourning in which it was
plunged this morning when Mrs.
Borah tearfully announced that Dr.
Daniels and his consultant had
given up all hope that the 74-year
old "lion of Idaho" would survive.
Until this morning only a hand
ful of intimates had known the true
nature of his illness. His absence
since Tuesday from the Senate—in
which he has served nearly 33 years,
two longer than any other senator—
had been attributed to bruises suf
fered in a fall at his apartment that
morning.
First intimation that he was se
riously ill came from his office
shortly before Mrs. Borah met with
newspapermen to report the hope
lessness of his condition. She dis
closed that he had suffered the
hemorrhage at the time of his fall
in the bathroom of their spacious
apartment near Rock Creek Park.
BEYONI) MEDICAL AID
She said that he had been in a
coma almost all of the time. A phy
sician and two trained nurses were
in constant attendance. Brief bulle
tins issued from time to time dis
closed that medical science could
devise little effective aid.
Borah's colleagues, among whom
he is dean in point of service, could
talk of nothing but his illness, once
it was revealed, and they recalled
that on Monday, the day before he
was stricken, he had been at his of
fice and in the Senate, happily re
lating that a thorough examination
by his physicians had shown him to
be in excellent condition.
LEADERS GRIEVE
At the White House, President
Roosevelt was receiving frequent
reports on the Senator's condition,
and at one time telephoned Mrs.
Borah personally to convey his
sympathy.
Vice-President John Nance Gar
ner, departing from his usual calm,
paced the floor in his cubby-hole
hideaway near the Senate chamber
and said Borah "will be missed as
much as any member of the Sen
ate."
Known as an expert on interna
tional relations in view of his pre
vious chairmanship of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, and
as a lifelong foe of monopoly,
Borah's reputation has achieved al
most legendary proportions in this
country and abroad.

vious chairmanship of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, and
as a lifelong foe of monopoly,
Borah's reputation has achieved al
most legendary proportions in this
country and abroad.
WASHINGTON, Jan. 18 (UP).—
Son. William E. Borah, 74, veteran
Idaho Republican whose legislative
fights won him world renown,
fought a losing battle against death
tonight and his personal physician,
Dr. Worth Daniels, said there is
"still no hope whatever" that he
might recover.
Dr. Daniels reported at 9:25 p.m.
that the condition of the veteran
isolationist leader, who was stricken
with a cerebral hemorrhage early
Tuesday, was unchanged and that
he had had only a few moments of
consciousness since 1 p.m.
He said it appeared that death was
only a matter of hours.
CAPITAL MOURNS
The capital remained in a state of
semi-mourning in which it was
plunged this morning when Mrs.
Borah tearfully announced that Dr.
Daniels and his consultant had
given up all hope that the 74-year
old "lion of Idaho" would survive.
Until this morning only a hand
ful of intimates had known the true
nature of his illness. His absence
since Tuesday from the Senate—in
which he has served nearly 33 years,
two longer than any other senator—
had been attributed to bruises suf
fered in a fall at his apartment that
morning.
First intimation that he was se
riously ill came from his office
shortly before Mrs. Borah met with
newspapermen to report the hope
lessness of his condition. She dis
closed that he had suffered the
hemorrhage at the time of his fall
in the bathroom of their spacious
apartment near Rock Creek Park.
BEYONI) MEDICAL AID
She said that he had been in a
coma almost all of the time. A phy
sician and two trained nurses were
in constant attendance. Brief bulle
tins issued from time to time dis
closed that medical science could
devise little effective aid.
Borah's colleagues, among whom
he is dean in point of service, could
talk of nothing but his illness, once
it was revealed, and they recalled
that on Monday, the day before he
was stricken, he had been at his of
fice and in the Senate, happily re
lating that a thorough examination
by his physicians had shown him to
be in excellent condition.
LEADERS GRIEVE
At the White House, President
Roosevelt was receiving frequent
reports on the Senator's condition,
and at one time telephoned Mrs.
Borah personally to convey his
sympathy.
Vice-President John Nance Gar
ner, departing from his usual calm,
paced the floor in his cubby-hole
hideaway near the Senate chamber
and said Borah "will be missed as
much as any member of the Sen
ate."
Known as an expert on interna
tional relations in view of his pre
vious chairmanship of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, and
as a lifelong foe of monopoly,
Borah's reputation has achieved al
most legendary proportions in this
country and abroad.
