# Freshman Five To Play Menlo, Paly Prepsters
## 
### 
With another week of practice
completed and the team just that
much smoother, Coach H. B. Lee's
freshman basketball squad stands
ready to repulse the invasions of
Menlo Junior College and Palo A.to
High School this week-end.
In their game against Menlo J. C.
tonight at 6:30 o'clock, the frosh
will face one of the best junior
college quintets in these parts, a
team that definitely has a very good
chance to lead the northern Cali
fornia junior college ranks.
MENLO SCORERS
With Jim Needham, high-scoring
center. Tommy Lathos, all-J.C. for
ward last year, and Bruce Howard,
all-City forward from San Fran
cisco, in the front line, Menlo pres
sents a team that may well topple
the frosh from their undefeated
rank.
As if the Menlo outfit isn't tough
enough to face with a healthy team,
the frosh will probably have to en
ter the fray without the services of
Ed Voss, who injured his ankle in
practice Monday and hasn't worked
out since, and W..lt Funabiki, who
has contracted a slight case of the
flu.
STAMM REPLACES VOSS
In Voss' center position will be
Ed Stamm, frosh footballer, who
will be counted on to keep Need
ham from scoring too much and also
to diminish the latter's effectiveness
on the backboards. In the event
that Stamm can't handle the assign
ment, Lee may put Hank Norberg.
another gridder. on Needham. All
during their high school clays Nor
berg guarded the Menlo star and
did an excellent job of it, so he
may get another chance tonight.
If last week-end's games are any
criteria, Jack Dana, who tallied a
total of 31 points against Salinas
J. C. and George Washington High
School, will be the main offensive
threat of the Papoose squad. Dana,
whose father is Herb Dana, former
Commissioner of Pacific Coast Con
ference football officials, has been
hitting the bucket consistently for
the last two weeks, and Lee is count
ing on him for plenty of points
tonight and tomorrow night.
LINE- I P UNDECIDED
Because Voss and Funabiki are
likely to see only little action, if any,
the starting line-up of the frosh five
will have several new men in it, but
Lee has not as yet decided just who
he will have open the game. How
ever, the top six men seem to be
Ross Meyer, Dana, Stamm. John
Eiklemnn, Fred Linari, and Nor
berg.
Tomorrow night's contest with
Palo Alto High School will also start

School, will be the main offensive
threat of the Papoose squad. Dana,
whose father is Herb Dana, former
Commissioner of Pacific Coast Con
ference football officials, has been
hitting the bucket consistently for
the last two weeks, and Lee is count
ing on him for plenty of points
tonight and tomorrow night.
LINE- I P UNDECIDED
Because Voss and Funabiki are
likely to see only little action, if any,
the starting line-up of the frosh five
will have several new men in it, but
Lee has not as yet decided just who
he will have open the game. How
ever, the top six men seem to be
Ross Meyer, Dana, Stamm. John
Eiklemnn, Fred Linari, and Nor
berg.
Tomorrow night's contest with
Palo Alto High School will also start
at 6:30 o'clock.
With another week of practice
completed and the team just that
much smoother, Coach H. B. Lee's
freshman basketball squad stands
ready to repulse the invasions of
Menlo Junior College and Palo A.to
High School this week-end.
In their game against Menlo J. C.
tonight at 6:30 o'clock, the frosh
will face one of the best junior
college quintets in these parts, a
team that definitely has a very good
chance to lead the northern Cali
fornia junior college ranks.
MENLO SCORERS
With Jim Needham, high-scoring
center. Tommy Lathos, all-J.C. for
ward last year, and Bruce Howard,
all-City forward from San Fran
cisco, in the front line, Menlo pres
sents a team that may well topple
the frosh from their undefeated
rank.
As if the Menlo outfit isn't tough
enough to face with a healthy team,
the frosh will probably have to en
ter the fray without the services of
Ed Voss, who injured his ankle in
practice Monday and hasn't worked
out since, and W..lt Funabiki, who
has contracted a slight case of the
flu.
STAMM REPLACES VOSS
In Voss' center position will be
Ed Stamm, frosh footballer, who
will be counted on to keep Need
ham from scoring too much and also
to diminish the latter's effectiveness
on the backboards. In the event
that Stamm can't handle the assign
ment, Lee may put Hank Norberg.

may get another chance tonight.
