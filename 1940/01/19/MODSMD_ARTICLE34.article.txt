spectacular bo\ing.

it was a light all the way.

away and assumed control of the
fight after the first minute. Gallar-.

thing to watch, had a great deal of
trouble dt lending himself from
Grant's left —a potent weapon in
itself.
STEIN lOCS ELLIOTT
Ed Stein vindicated himself in
this tourney with a second-round
T.K.O. over Jack Elliot: in ihe 17a
pound division the only non-de
cision bout of the evening. Referee
Jake Irwin stopped Ihe fight when
Stein had Elliott gx'ojjgy lrom ter
rific rights and lefts to the head.
Doug Grant had two workouts to
night. The first came when he de
cisioned Bobby Oaklord in the 1(»5-
pound class. The second came while
he was trying, with only moderate
success, to keep from busting his
vest buttons at the showing made by
his "little brother, Don. against
Gallarneau.
In perhaps the best boxing exhi
bition of the evening, Tom Mac
lVlichael deeisioned Jimmy McCloud.
This one was close, with both ex
hibiting considerable ring wisdom.
MacMiehael came out on top be
cause his longer reach enabled him
to throw more telling punches than
McCloud.
WILD BRAWL
The wildest brawl of the whole
card occurred when lrosh Frank
Hewitt deeisioned Jim Potts. In the
first round. Potts put Hewitt down
for a nine-count, with a roundhouse
left flush on the button. Hewitt
wisely took the full count, then got
up and outboxed the hard-hitting
Potts cleanly for the rest of the fight.
