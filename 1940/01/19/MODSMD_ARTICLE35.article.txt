# Mural Mermen Set for Clash
## 
### 
Will Co-Captain Roy Vitousek or
Pete Okumoto win the freestyle
sprints tomorrow at 2 o'clock in tht
annual interclass swimfest at En
cina pool?
Will Don Smith make a brilliant
intercollegiate opening in the middle
distances? Can Vitousek come back
to beat veteran Lloyd Wilson in
the breaststroke and pull an "iron
man stunt? Can Freshman Baylor
Colyear give Co-Captain Bill Weed
en a backstroke race? Can the horde
of frosh freestylers give their class a
victory over the favored juniors?
This, plus many elements which
aren't so interrogative, such as a
diving victory lor Howie Adams,
will be up for reckoning tomorrow
when the swimmer's judgment day
will give Stanfordites and the rest
of the conference a preview of In
dian strength.
