# Ruggers Play Here Saturday
## 
### 
In the opening game of the 1940
season, Cardinal ruggers tangle with
the University Club of San Fran
cisco tomorrow afternoon in the
Stanford Stadium starting at 2:110
o'clock. Admission is free.
Although the recent rains have
hampered practice, Coaches Jim
Wylie, Willard Clausen and Harry
Maloney will field a team that will
be in good early season condition.
Two games will be played, the
"Â£]" game taking place at 3:30 o'clock.
Veterans from last year's champion
ship team will hold down most of
the starting berths on the "A" squad,
and the faces of such varsity foot
ballers as Norm Standlee, Hugh
Callarneau, and Pete Kmetovic will
be prominently in evidence.
