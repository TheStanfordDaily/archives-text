THE Firehouse Boys' charges that they are
being denied the right to play in intramural
sports (see Campus Opinion) and the denials
of Manager Andy Stojkovich (see page 1) bring
into the spotlight a somewhat startling aspect of
inter-organization athletic activities.
While accusations of proselyting and pro
fessionalism in varsity athletics are as numer
ous as the words on any American sports page,
to date intramural sports have been regarded
as lily-white and 100 per cent pure.
According to the fire laddies, Stojkovich
threatened to bar them from competition be
cause they are "a bunch of all-stars."
According to Stojkovich, he may have called
them all-stars, but he did not declare them in
eligible to take part in the intramural program.
This is one of those arguments that can only
be ironed out in a good long bull-session, such
as is scheduled to take place this afternoon with
all interested parties attending.
The significant aspects of the situation ap
pear in connection with the charges of prose
lyting and unfairness in intramurals. Although
no one is willing to make any formal accusation,
a number of fraternity and club men have ex
pressed the belief that the Firehouse admits
new residents only on condition that they agree
to play on its teams rather than on those of their
former affiliations.
It is only natural that the rest of the teams
should be gunning for the intramural football
champions. However, there are more satisfying
ways of knocking them off the top of the pile
than by official action. Stojkovich is being
accused of trying to hamstring the Firehouse in
the same way that Atherton is handling U.S.C.
It may be that Coast Conference athletics
have become so rotten that they need a police
man to clean them up. But certainly that is not
true of Stanford's intramural sports.
The entire purpose of such activities is com
pletely alien to any such accusations as have
arisen in the current controversy. Intramurals
are designed to promote friendly rivalries be
tween living groups and to give every man on
the campus a chance to participate in a health
ful, enjoyable sports program, free from the
strain of intercollegiate competition.
The Firehouse is a living group recognized
by the Dean of Men's office, and- if it has been
observing the intramural regulations, as well
as obeying coaches' training regulations, there
is no reason why it should be barred from
competition.
However, if it has not been living up to the
rules, both in letter and spirit, if it has been
proselyting players from other organizations, it
will have to suffer the consequences.
If the apple is rotten, it must be eliminated
before it contaminates what is otherwise a damn
good barrel.
