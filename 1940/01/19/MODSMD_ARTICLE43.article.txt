THE state has the power to enforce those laws
which it enacts for the public good. In like
manner, Stanford is entitled to support its writ
ten law, its constitution, its traffic code, its lock
out restrictions.
The laws are written, the judgments made are
based on precedent and are followed by sen
tence based on equal precedent.
But a tradition can no more be enforced than
can the ethics of social conduct. Stanford's "No
Smoking on the Quad" tradition is not subject
to policing.
Yesterday it was suggested that Circle "S"
Society take unto itself the job of tapping on
the shoulder those who persist in ignoring this
well-founded mode of conduct to smoke on the
Quad. Circle "S," as might be expected, did not
desire to take the job of "proctor" to the student
body and insist that between-classes cigarettes
be stamped out.
The consensus of student leaders last night
was that this was not the way of a tradition,
though the "police" method of enforcing the
particular tradition in question was tried about
eight or nine years ago, with success, by two
now-defunct organizations, "Skull and Snakes"
and "Quadrangle Club."
Tradition, however, is not law. It is simply
good taste, with a background in history. It
should be at the basis of every student's regard
for Stanford today, the foundation of conduct
at the University.
Unfortunately, since it is not law, it is very
easy to forget tradition, to slip into new and in
congruous ways of conduct. That is what has
happened to Stanford's "No Smoking on the
Quad."
What is needed is therefore not policing. "No
Smoking" is not an enforceable rule. But, like
the rivalry with California, like the frosh bon
fire and the "Ride to Paly," it is simply a matter
of memory.

Let each student, as he crosses the Quad,
think of it as a separate and distinct part of the
campus—a place old and hallowed, and grace
ful with that age. Thinking this, it will be easy
to remember that cigarettes are not to be lighted
before reaching the walks at the edge of the
Quad.
A tradition, remembered and respected, can
be kept by the individual action of each student
at Stanford; it would be a denial of tradition to
enforce it.—J. B.
