### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
FROM VENUS DE Mn.O TO DARNING EGGS
TMIERE has often been a little disagreement between
artists and art-lovers as to what the hell com
prises art.
John Galsworthy made some interesting comments
on this argument in a short story about a very artistic
novelist. This novelist chap was rather straightfor
wardly and naively attempting to write a good book.
He finally succeeded in getting a fairly interesting story
published, and it became a best-seller, like "The
Grapes of Wrath." But tlie author's friends, who were
novel-critics, said that the book was not very artistic.
It only had promise.
Being a conscientious writer, our heroic young nov
elist tried again. This time the book wasn't too popu
lar, but the critics thought it was getting more "ar
tistic." The novelist tried a third time, and a fourth
time. And all the while his books were getting pro
gressively less popular but progressively "more ar
tistic." And finally he created such a perfect work of
art that not even the critics could wade through it.
So the novelist, basking in the glory of his paragon of
art, took the book out to his garden, intending to read
his masterpiece. But the book was too boring, too
artistic. And the novelist just fell asleep.
* * * X'
IVOW it is possible that mobile sculpture is approach
ing the peak of art. At any rate, here is one argu
ment in favor of its being the highest of artistic
achievements. It is rather difficult to imagine many
people visiting an art gallery in which the statues
were made of copper coils, tin roofing, string, a brass
rod, and a wooden darning egg.
Personally, I was reared in a reactionary old school
of art; I have always felt that one should be able to
make heads and tails of a picture or statue. According
to this backward hypothesis, of course, the statue
loses a good deal of its aesthetic value if it is turned
upside down.
Mobile art is not cramped by such a limitation.
Venus de Milo may not look so good standing on her
head. But a darning egg is just about as beautiful no
matter how you look at it.
In fact, one of the finest features of mobile art is
that you can make the coils and strings and darning
eggs swing around and get even more artistic results.
One can readily see the advantages of such a system
by picturing the results if you were to swing Venus
de Milo around on a string or have a piece of tin
roofing banging around just below her head.
Yes, mobile art is definitely progressive. Just like
John Galsworthy's novelist.

make heads and tails of a picture or statue. According
to this backward hypothesis, of course, the statue
loses a good deal of its aesthetic value if it is turned
upside down.
Mobile art is not cramped by such a limitation.
Venus de Milo may not look so good standing on her
head. But a darning egg is just about as beautiful no
matter how you look at it.
In fact, one of the finest features of mobile art is
that you can make the coils and strings and darning
eggs swing around and get even more artistic results.
One can readily see the advantages of such a system
by picturing the results if you were to swing Venus
de Milo around on a string or have a piece of tin
roofing banging around just below her head.
Yes, mobile art is definitely progressive. Just like
John Galsworthy's novelist.

TMIERE has often been a little disagreement between
artists and art-lovers as to what the hell com
prises art.
John Galsworthy made some interesting comments
on this argument in a short story about a very artistic
novelist. This novelist chap was rather straightfor
wardly and naively attempting to write a good book.
He finally succeeded in getting a fairly interesting story
published, and it became a best-seller, like "The
Grapes of Wrath." But tlie author's friends, who were
novel-critics, said that the book was not very artistic.
It only had promise.
Being a conscientious writer, our heroic young nov
elist tried again. This time the book wasn't too popu
lar, but the critics thought it was getting more "ar
tistic." The novelist tried a third time, and a fourth
time. And all the while his books were getting pro
gressively less popular but progressively "more ar
tistic." And finally he created such a perfect work of
art that not even the critics could wade through it.
So the novelist, basking in the glory of his paragon of
art, took the book out to his garden, intending to read
his masterpiece. But the book was too boring, too
artistic. And the novelist just fell asleep.

IVOW it is possible that mobile sculpture is approach
ing the peak of art. At any rate, here is one argu
ment in favor of its being the highest of artistic
achievements. It is rather difficult to imagine many
people visiting an art gallery in which the statues
were made of copper coils, tin roofing, string, a brass
rod, and a wooden darning egg.
Personally, I was reared in a reactionary old school
of art; I have always felt that one should be able to
make heads and tails of a picture or statue. According
