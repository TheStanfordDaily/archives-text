# CAMPUS OPINION
## INTRAMURAL DISCRIMINATION 
### 
'yilE EDITOR, SIR:
The Stanford Firehouse has been informed that
they are no longer eligible for competition in Stan
ford's intramural athletic program. Manager Andy
Stojkovich gave as his reasons for the suspension the
claim that the Firehouse was not a living group and
that the Firehouse had too many members of bctter
than-average athletic ability.
I am sure that Manager Andy Stojkovich is aware
of the situation. He knows that the Firehouse has
complied with every rule of intramural competition.
It is his duty to hold up for the Firehouse, in the
face of the subversive elements that want the Fire
house disqualified.
May I point out the fact that the Firehouse is as
much a living group as any living group on the cam
pus, although there are no Greek letters over the door.
Surely the powers-that-be are aware that the Stanford
Firehouse is made up of 14 Stanford st J dents who
live in the Filehouse, study in the Firehouse, and
phone their friends from the Firehouse. The only real
difference is that to a man, the men in the Firehouse
depend upon their jobs as firemen to continue their
education at Stanford University and not upon the
checks from home.
* * * ;!<
MIGHT be said that of the 14 men in the Fire
house, two or three might possess better-than-aver
age athletic ability. But every living group on the
campus can boast of more than that. The very fact
that the Firehouse has not at any time violated any
intramural rules in regard to eligibility of individual
players should speak for itself. If the rules should
be changed, let's change the rules; but let's not fabri
cate illusions as to the superiority of the men in the
Firehouse. (The Zetes tied them twice.)

Tom Collins
