# THE 						FIREHOUSE PROTESTS
## 
### 
r J' , HE EDITOR, SIR:
Can you help us?
Andy Stojkovich (a bourgeois stooge) who is in
charge of the intramural program, has refused to per
mit any more Firehouse athletic teams to participate
in the intramural sports. His reasons, given orally,
are first, that the Firehouse Ls composed of students
who are, or have been "athletes," and second, that
orders have come down from "above" to the effect
that the Firehouse should be indefinitely suspended
from competition.
To dispose of the first reason, we need only point
out that, while it is true that the Firehouse does have
a number of "athlete" members, on the other hand,
its use of these men was no more promiscuous than that
of the other living groups in competition thus far.
It has complied with every requirement of the intra
mural tournament and by this very fact it should be
eligible to compete right now. If there is any question
as to whether the Firehouse is technically a living
group, we refer those in doubt to the Dean of Men's
office.

JJUT let's pass over the obvious and get to the core
of the situation. After debating upon Stojkovich's
announcement, we arrived at this conclusion: that
Stojkovich, probably a victim of circumstances, has
been, may we say, incited to this end by certain ele
ments which refrain from making their position known
to the public as well as the Firehouse.
We believe, furthermore, that we are rightfully
indignant at this undisguised discrimination. To the
man, we are hereby formally protesting, over the head
of Stojkovich, in the hope that those having the final
authority to decide on the eligibility of the Firehouse,
will, if not reinstate us, at least give their reasons as
much free air as we have (his protest.
