# King, Segal Shenanigans Steal 'Angel' Musical Hit
## 
### 
"I MARRIED AN ANGEL,"
Itodgers and liart musical cur
rently playing at San Francisco's
Curran Theater.
A pair of aces back to back are a
good start in a stud poker game, and
a pair of ace legitimate stage plays
side by side are even more attrac
tive (depending, of course, on where
your interests lie).
While Maurice Evans as "Hamlet"
fascinates one audience at the
Geary Theater, next door most of
the original New York cast is cur

! rently presenting the naughty little
musical comedy, "I Married an An
gel," which was one of the hits of
last summer's legitimate season on
Broadway.
Dennis King, who rose to fame
years ago with his stage and screen
portrayals of "The Vagabond King,"
i and Vivienne Segal, another old
j timer, mug cutely through their
parts, and their shenanigans com
pletely steal the show from Karen
! Van Ryn, the "Angel" who floats
; down from heaven when she hears
King say that the woman he mar
j lies would have to be an angel from
up above.
In the New York show, Zorina,
the petite foreign dancer, look the
! pail of the angel, and critics raved
j about her performance. The absence
fof the actress who originated the
part is probably what prevents "I
j Married an Angel" from being a
hilarious farce rather than what it
j is—a highly amusing comedy that is
j an ace of clubs rather than an ace
i of spades.
MUSIC, STAGING EXCELLENT
Vivienne Segal gets most of the
j risque lines, and puts them over re
] freshingly. Her beauty and trim fig
ure make the playgoer forget her
age, but King is obviously not quite
so young as he used to be.
Top songs from the "Angel" are
the title tune and "Spring is Here,"
while Vivienne Segal puts over a
j suggestive ditty entitled, "A Twinkle
I in Your Eye," which you will not
| hear in public places unless the
: words are changed a bit—if you get
j what I mean.
The staging is excellent, and the
j ballet scenes are expertly done.
All in all, it's splendid enter
l tainment.—Mayer

While Maurice Evans as "Hamlet"
fascinates one audience at the
Geary Theater, next door most of
the original New York cast is cur

! rently presenting the naughty little
musical comedy, "I Married an An
gel," which was one of the hits of
last summer's legitimate season on
Broadway.
Dennis King, who rose to fame
years ago with his stage and screen
portrayals of "The Vagabond King,"
i and Vivienne Segal, another old
j timer, mug cutely through their
parts, and their shenanigans com
pletely steal the show from Karen
! Van Ryn, the "Angel" who floats
; down from heaven when she hears
King say that the woman he mar
j lies would have to be an angel from
up above.
In the New York show, Zorina,
the petite foreign dancer, look the
! pail of the angel, and critics raved
j about her performance. The absence
fof the actress who originated the
part is probably what prevents "I
j Married an Angel" from being a
hilarious farce rather than what it
j is—a highly amusing comedy that is
j an ace of clubs rather than an ace
i of spades.
MUSIC, STAGING EXCELLENT
Vivienne Segal gets most of the
j risque lines, and puts them over re
] freshingly. Her beauty and trim fig
ure make the playgoer forget her
age, but King is obviously not quite
so young as he used to be.
Top songs from the "Angel" are
the title tune and "Spring is Here,"
while Vivienne Segal puts over a
j suggestive ditty entitled, "A Twinkle
I in Your Eye," which you will not
| hear in public places unless the
: words are changed a bit—if you get
j what I mean.
The staging is excellent, and the
j ballet scenes are expertly done.
All in all, it's splendid enter
l tainment.—Mayer
"I MARRIED AN ANGEL,"
Itodgers and liart musical cur
rently playing at San Francisco's
Curran Theater.
A pair of aces back to back are a
good start in a stud poker game, and
a pair of ace legitimate stage plays
side by side are even more attrac
tive (depending, of course, on where
your interests lie).
