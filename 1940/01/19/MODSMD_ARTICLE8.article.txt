With student executives faced with the delicate problem of forbidding a
violation—so far officially unrecognized—of an unwritten Farm statute,
the recent of smoking on Quad will lead to one week more of
campus controversy led by Coline Upshaw, vice-president of the student
body, and by Anne Townsend, it was announced yesterday. During the

W e»»k living groups will be
their opinions of "enforcement" of ]
the tradition, and the recommenda- j
tions will be given to Ex Committee. !
HOOVER DENIES STATEMENT
Dick Hoover, president of Circle S, i
minor sports honorary, denied the i
statement made yesterday afternoon j
to The Daily by Harry Maloney,
sponsor of Circle S, that he and
Hoover were to appear before Ex j
Committee to decide upon the ad- |
visability of choosing the 35 members
of the honorary to "tactfully in- i
struct" the code violators not to
smoke on Quad. Not only did he j
know nothing of the proposal, Hoo- ;
ver said, but he doubted if all mem
bers of Circle S would care to be
come "proctors."
"It's a good enough idea," Hoover
added, "but I'm not going to commit
: myself or the rest of the men on
! whether they will or no, if asked."
COBBS SILENT
When questioned John Cobbs, :
graduate manager, said that he knew
nothing of the Circle S plan, and
I made no further comment.
I The question of who will be named
I policemen will be raised at all house j
| and hall meetings Monday evening, j
; and Ex Committee will decide on
j final action at the recommendation
j of the two advisers.
"The situation is difficult to han
' die," Miss Upshaw said yesterday.
