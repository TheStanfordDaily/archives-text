### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
AFTER last week's little scare,
when Hitler's Nazi legions were
supposedly prepared to goose-step
across the yet untouched borders of
Europe's neutrals, the Continent has
been belligerently quiet.
You could almost hear a pin drop
along the Westwall. German and
Russian propagandists were at work
counteracting the advice to neutrals
that Winston Churchill had broad
cast last week. Most of World War
li s activity was on the high seas—
ships were sunk and bombs explod
ed; mines were laid; submarines
terrorized shipping. Up in Finland,
though, that section of the second
world conflict that has been most
bitter was in full swing.

The Russians were still conduct
ing their "Finnish five-year plan"
rather unsuccessfully. At least
one new and somewhat significant
development was apparent. Fin
land's air force carried the war to
a new sector yesterday. In re
prisal for the Soviets' mass aerial
attacks on Finnish cities and
towns, their winged death-dealers
sped across the Gulf of Finland
and bombed Russian air bases at
Baltiski and other points along the
Estonian coast. They were not
blasting at Russian forts and bases
on Russian soil, but on Estonian
territory.

/ 'APTURED Soviet airmen have
4 confirmed the fact that bombing
and machine-gunning red army
planes, sweeping over Finland by
the hundreds, have come from the
Baltic bases which Russia acquired
under her recent mutual air pact
with Estonia. If Finnish retaliation
this week-end has been effective, an
important source of Soviet strength
may be wiped out. The Finnish
pilots weie aided by volunteers
from Sweden, which gave the whole
incident a tinge of internationalism.
There Swedish volunteers are
mean men in a plane. According
to the Finnish high command,
they've shot down six Russian
planes in battle in (he past few
days. Furthermore, the white
garbed Finnish ski-men have cap
tured several more Russian strong
points along Lake Ladoga, improv
ing the small country's military
position.

r JTHERE was no new word of the
major battle developing on the
Salla front above the Arctic Circle
where the Russians are battling in
bitter cold to hold their new forti
fied lines around Lake Marka, 45
miles from their border, and offset
their 30-mile retreat of last week.
The Russians were fighting away
stubbornly and launching an occa
sional counter-attack spearheaded
by tanks.
* $ *
Incidentally, the Finns have a
novel way of dealing with Rus
sian tanks on the Salla front.
Armed with crowbars, two Finnish
lads leap out of hiding places in
the woods on the "blind" side of
the tanks, clamber atop them,
and begin prying open the lids of
the turrets. The Russians, unable
to fire on them, are as unprotected
as a canful of sardines after
someone has twisted off the cover.
They usually try to dislodge the
Finns by careening the tanks over
obstacles. But. leech - like, the
Finns nearly always hold on. After
they pry open the lids, they chuck
in a hand grenade or two. And
that clears up the matter.
