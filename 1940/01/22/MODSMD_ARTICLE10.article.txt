# Firehouse Men Eligible For Murals
## Stojkovich, Wolter Direct Appeasement In 'Confused Set-up' 
### VIC MINAHAN 
The Firehouse is eligible for In
tramural competition.
Stanford's own version of the war
of nerves, with Andy Stojkovich
and the Firehouse boys facing each
other over the name-calling fronts,
wound up in a Munich Friday af
ternoon, with Stojkovich and Harry
Wolters, intramural committee
chairman, directing the appease
ment moves.
Stojkovich, who had been accused
by t.he Firehouse boys of barring
them from intramural competition
on the ground that they were not a
living group, denied that he had
done so.
"I never said that they weren't a
living group," he said. "I said they
were a bunch of all-stars, and I still
say so.
STOJKOVICH EXPLAINS
"I believe that having one team
always stronger than the others is
bad for the league. A lot of people
agree with me, but under the pres
ent rules, we can't do anything. The
Firehouse is entirely eligible."
Stojkovich also decried the Daily
for comparing him with Edwin Ath
erton, Pacific Coast "czar."
Wolter, who, along with Stojko
vich, represented the intramural
committee at the conference Friday
afternoon, confirmed the eligibility
of the Firehouse. "There was never
any question of their being eligible,"
he said. "It was just a confused
set-up, and they all went away
happy."
FIRE LADS NOT HAPPY
The happiness of the Firehouse
boys was not too much in evidence
yesterday, though, with most of the
inmates still smarting under Stojko
vich's alleged statement that they
were not a living group. Tom Col
lins, who with Monty Pfly and Jack
Lodato made up the Firehouse clique
at the conference, was especially
bitter about Stojkovich's attitude.
"I think Andy has been very un
fair about the whole thing," he said.
"He definitely told two of our men
that we were ineligible for winter
quarter competition, and he hinted
as much to others. His denials at the
conference and afterwards are just
a belated attempt to 'save face.'
WOLTER IS PRAISED
"His statements regarding our be
ing bad for the league are entirely
without ground. Intramural par
ticipation went from 400 to 1200 this
year, and I think that the fact that
better men were playing helped
ralher than hindered it. It is ob
vious that the iot of people' agree
ing with him are merely jealous
fraternity factions."
Collins praised Harry Wolter's
handling of the situation. "He was
very fair about the whole thing," he
said.
