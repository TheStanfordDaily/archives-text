# Stanford Speakers Bureau Pages Soap-Boxless Orators
## 
### AUDREY STEELE 
Minus the pebbles and a fireside, 46' potential Stanford Demosthenes'
and F.D.R.'s are speaking before dozens of northern California service
groups every week.
Technically these half a hundred silver tongues arc called the Speak
ers Bureau. Organized in the spring of 1936, the bureau was the brain

child of an ambitious young sopho
more named Charles Shaefer.
Since then, in the short span of
four years, more than 40 new co
horts have been added and the
group welcomes a.ny new recruit
that wants to join the fold. The bu
reau claim is, "Join up and meet a
lot of people outside of school—if
you don't know how to talk, we'll
teach you how and even find some
thing for you to talk about."
ANNOUNCEMENT ISSUED
Fresh off the press today are some
500 copies of a Winter-Spring An
nouncement of 1940 speakers and
topics that will be sent out to in
terested clubs, schools, church, and
other organizations listing 46 names
and 66 blurbs of speeches of these
Stanford ambassadors.
Behind these 30-minute talks are
unusual stories of adventure, work,
and trips to strange places. Born in
Singapore and raised by a Chinese
amah, bureau member Serena
Frankel can spin tales of life on
that Oriental island. Jack Grover,
the magic man of the group, con
tinues to mystify audiences with
disappearing rabbits and traveling
50-cent pieces.
Jack Temple, grad student, takes
the listener through the intricacies
of making a "super" movie produc
tion, recounting personal expe
riences of two and a half years as
an assistant director at 20th Century
Fox. Reliving her travels through
Mexico, Margaretta Jakobsen traced
her trip through the land that is a
"Gateway to Adventure."
Guiding lights of this growing
campus activity are Hugh O'Don
nell, manager, and Mr. D. P. McKel
vey, faculty adviser. Officed on the
top floor of the Union, manager and
adviser also welcome any interested
executive-minded student.
University credit is given for
membership on the bureau.
