## Councils to Seek Out Popular Sentiments Concerning Tradition 
### 
Student leaders will attempt to
leam this afternoon the campus
opinions and solutions concerning
the newly arisen smoking-on-Quad
question, prior to making recommen
dations for action to Ex Committee
Tuesday evening.
At 1 o'clock Women's Conference,
led by President Annabelle Clark,
will determine the feeling among
women's living groups about whether
offenders against a sentiment laid
down by Mrs. Stanford should be
punished, or whether the sentiment
should be abolished.
UPSHAW TO REPORT
The findings of the confercnce will
be incorporated in the report of Co
line Upshaw, vice-president of A.S.-
S.U., and Anne Townsend, who have
been appointed by Student Body
President Ken Cuthbertson to in
vestigate the problem.
Later in the afternoon Bob Putnam
is expected to present the question
in Men's Council, with the idea of
reporting to Ex Committee.
The committee Tuesday will be
the deciding authority in determin
ing tl.o extent of the violation, the
feeling of the campus concerning it,
and in describing the remedy. The
advisability of appointing a student
committee to censure offenders will
be considered.
SITUATION DELICATE
Miss Upshaw, commenting on the
problem which arose in Ex Com
mittee meeting last week, said:
"It's a delicate situation. Once a
tradition must be made into a rule,
with penalties for violations, its
whole value Is lost. It will be im
possible to follow Stanford men and
women around the Quad checking
up on their smoking. There is no
authority forbidding it except the
attitude of the students themselves,
and to write down a law and punish
offenders would be silly and futile.
Still, I believe a solution can be
found that neither abolishes nor
policies."
