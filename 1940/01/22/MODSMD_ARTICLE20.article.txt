# University Orders Three New Encina Fire Escapes Installed Within 15 Days
## Chief Dugan Describes Old Escapes As 'More Hazard Than Protection'; Improvements to Cost Nearly $1,500 
### 
Installation of throe new fire eseapes in Encina Hall within the next 10
or 15 days nt a price of $1500 has been ordered by the University adminis
tration according to an announcement by Assistant Comptroller E. S. Erwin
last night.
Designed to provide fundamental protection from fire for the 500 in
habitants of the freshman donn, the new escapes will be placed at both

ends and in the rear of the structure,
following the specifications of a re
cent survey.
Mr. Edwin, when asked if the ad
ditional fire escapes are necessary
for fundamental protection of human
life in case of fire, answered, "Yes - ,
it's obvious that they need them."
JACKSON INTERVIEWED
Acting Comptroller J. Hugh Jack
son stated last night that the new
escapes have been on order for some
months.
Interviewed last night, Fire Chief
R. E. Dugan stated, "Fire protection
in Encina is very poor at the present
time; the two fire escapes are more
of a hazard than a protection."
Chief Dugan also stated that Un
repealed ringing of the fire alarm
system in the frosh donn by Inhabi
tants is a further detriment to fire
protection, since students pÂ«y little
attention to the alarm-
FROSH IGNORE ALARMS
One Encina resident, when ques
tioned of the effect of the ringing of
alarms during the night, stated, "I
just roll over and try to go back to
sleep."
"In case of a fire in Encina," Chief
Dugan said, "any one of the threo
stair wells would aid materially the
spread of fire throughout the build
ing, and in case the fire originated on
the basement floor, all three vertical
arteries could spread the fire."
MAIN EXIT FAULTY
Chief Dugan also stated that all
main exit doors of the building, one
of the fix*st built on the campus, open
inward, which violates a cardinal
point of fire safety for public and
quasi-public buildings.
The Chief stated that a further
safety problem is the fact that fire
hoses of the five-story building arc
dragged from their places and
"played with" by the students, par
ticularly during football season.
