CREW FIGHTS FLAMES
The Orazio was about 60 or 70
miles from Barcelona when the fire
broke out this morning and through
out the day members of the crew
lought the spreading flames.
At 6 p.m. the Orazio sent out a
distress call, saying the 600 passen
gers were being put into lifeboats
and that the fire was out of control.
The two French destroyers, the
names of which were not given be
cause of wartime censorship, imme
diately rushed to the scene.
Ambulances, doctors and nurses
were ordered to the wharfs at
Toulon and Marseilles and clinics in
both cities were prepared to receive
the injured and those suffering from
exposure.
