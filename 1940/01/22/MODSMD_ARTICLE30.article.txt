# 'Sentinel' Tells A.S.U. Motives
## Publication Clarifies Local 'Union' Policies 
### 
To further explain recent activi
ties of the local chapter of the
American Student Union, the Stan
ford Sentinel, carrying the motto,
"On Guard for Peace and Democ
racy," was recently distributed on
the campus.
Under the title, "Our Program,"
the mimeographed organ states,
"Wishing to clarify the position of
the Stanford chapter of the A.S.U.
on the much discussed action of the
national convention of the Student
Union, the Stanford chapter issues
the following statement and com
ment:
REFUSES TO CONDEMN
"The National Convention be
came the target of nationwide criti
cism when it refused to pass a mo
tion which would condemn Russia
as the aggressor in the present Rus
sian-Finnish conflict." Following
this statement is the recent resolu
tion of the local chapter as reported
in Monday's Daily.
Elsewhere in the publication, to '
be distributed weekly, is the follow- 1
ing statement in connection with the
question of local and national A.S.U.
policy:
NO INCONSISTENCY
"We feel that it is significant that
the National Convention did not
take a positive stand condemning
Russia, but rather refused to take
action on the matter. By doing so
the Convention refused to join an
active anti-Russian campaign which
would have been inconsistent with
its stand on peace.
"Refusal to deal with the problem
does not necessarily mean the dele
gates sanctioned or supported Rus
sia's action. The matter is entirely
secondary to the real aims of the
A.S.U."
