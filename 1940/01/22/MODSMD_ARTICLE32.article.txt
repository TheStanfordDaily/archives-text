# Ross Flays Up Female Foibles In Comedy Role
## Frosh Actor Flirts, Romps Through Part For 'Warrior' Satire 
### 
Norman Ross, who is Sapiens, the
comedy lead in "The Warrior's Hus
band," scheduled for production in
Memorial Hall on Feb. 1, 2. and 3, is
a freshman playing his first large
part on the Farm stage.
His other appearances have been
in minor roles in last quarter's "The
Great Divide" and the Gaieties'
"Branner Hysteria" skit.
PART IMPORTANT
The part of Sapiens is, in some
respect, the most important in the
Thompson farce, for it is almost en -
tirely through this character thai the
Amazonian social set-up is ex
plained. Sapiens is an Amazon man
â€”delicate, well-bred, and something
of a flirt. His mother, through a
political coup, brings about his mar
riage to Hyppolyta, queen of the
Amazons, played by Sylvia Onesti.
They are a typical married couple
in reverse. The wife has no time
to bother with hoi fo< lish little hus
band while she's fighting a war, and
he, in turn, feels neglected and hurt.
ATTEMPTS REVOLT
He hears about the Greek men
who "fight, drink, and ride astride"
and decides to give the men of his
country some of this new freedom.
He's satirically pictured as an ex
ponent of Amazon "flaming youth."
Ross has been presented with sev
eral problems during rehearsals. He
had to learn how to do a full court
curtsy without falling over his vo
luminous skirts; how to flirt after
the feminine manner, and how to be
properly coy and retiring when An
tiope, played by Sylvia Berry, makes
love to him.
