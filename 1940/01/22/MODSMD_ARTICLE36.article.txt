# Smashing Indians Smear Cal Quintet, 55-32
## Victory Over Hears Ties Farm, S.C.; Title Hinges On Crucial L.A. Contests Indians Down Strong C.O.P. Cagers By 60-36 Margin in Saturday's Tilt; Four New Ares Appear for Varsity 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Just in case nobody lias hoard, Stanford's sizzling basketball team
whipped the daylights out of a hapless, weary Golden Bear quintet. 55-32,
Friday night.
Then for good measure and as a warm-up for this week-end's task,
Coach Everett Dean's varsity and second stringers polished off a surpris-

ingly strong College of the
five, (>O-3(>, Saturday night.
The defeat of the ponderous, gi
gantic Bears—one of the worst in
the history of the Stanford-Cal
basketball rivalry—is now only sec- j
ond-rate in importance to the "croo- I
,shial" two-game series with the
Trojans of Southern California in j
Los Angeles this Friday and Satur
day nights.
ODDS MAY BE EVEN
The Trojans are deadlocked in I
the Southern P /ision standings
with the Indians as a result of
U.S.C.'s 54-32 smothering of U.C.L.A.
for the latter's 30th con
ference trimming.
What the Card series down South j
will solve is whether Dean's pol- I
Lshed cagers are in the same class I
as Sam Barry's title favorites. After j
the Indians had reckoned with the |
once-mighty Bears, most of the ex- !
ports were generally agreed that '
with the same kind of play, the J
locals will be even choices to come
out with a split of their games j
against Troy.
CARDS TAKE OFFENSIVE
Stanford took Cal's measure by a |
goodly 23 points. The Trojans last j
week were able to top the Bear |
totals by only 13 and seven points I
in two games.
A brief picture of how thoroughly !
the Indians stopped tHe shadow of a '
former great team runs like this:
Getting two points before the j
game was half a minute old on '
Fordy Anderson's set shot, the In- I
dians piled up such a total that I
they led 23-10 at the half, while their j
defense held the Bears to two field '
goals—a set and a side shot.
TAYLOR, COWDEN STAND OUT |
Stanford's previously unheralded
aces, Taylor and Cowden, were
standouts in turning the Bear de
leat into a rout. Sophomore Cowden
sank nine points, a good offensive 1
total for a guard, but what pleased ■
Dean more was his remarkable play !
in taking care of Bear shots off the |
backboard.
Taylor was cast in the role of ;
guard for Big Bill Ogilvie. All that
the last year's runner-up scorer to i
Ralph Vaughan of S.C. got was a
field goal and a foul throw for
three points. Taylor did himself
proud by sinking seven points.
The Indian defense was so tight ;
that Cal garnered but three set-up \
shots—the rest were long and far j
out. These shots, when missed, j
were rendered ineffective because
the Bears failed to follow them up, |
thus making Cowden's and Tay
lor's work easier. On the other j
hand quite a few Indian shots were
scored from tip-ins after long shots j
had missed fire.
The College of the Pacific game
showed up two substitute forwards, j
Lafaille and Penn, who'll be val- !
uable men when the club meets
Troy.
The newcomers between them sank
13 field goals.


SINKING 15 POINTS against Cal
Friday night, Don Williams re
mains high-point man on the Card
five and is challenging Jackie Rob
inson for the second place in the
conference.
