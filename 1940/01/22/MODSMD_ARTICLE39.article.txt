## Papooses Crush Paly High, 45-29; Stamm Sparkles in Victory 
### 
Menlo J. C. smashed the perfect
record of Stanford's freshman bas
ketball team Friday night when they
trounced the Frosh 41 - 33. The
Bulldogs hatted a late rally which
the Frosh five uncorked in the last
quarter, and won going away. Sat
urday night in a prelim for the var
sity clash with Pacific, the Frosh
conquered Palo Alto High easily,
43-29.
STARTS WELL
The IVlenlo game started off auspi
ciously for the yearlings, but with
the score 14-12 for the Frosh late in
the first half, the Bulldogs ran eight
straight tallies to lead 20-14 at the
midpoint. Opening the second half,
the Menlo five ran up ten more
points before Ross Meyer hit a free
throw for Stanford.
The Frosh then put on a spurt
of their own and ran up. a dozen
points to the Bulldogs' one. Jack
Dana, Henry Plate, James McCaf
frey and big Ed Stamm counted in
rapid-fire order and the Menlo club
found itself ahead only 25-32. The
Frosh had burned themselves out,
however, and Menlo closed with a
rush to win.
LATIIOS LEADS MENLO
Little Tommy Lnthos and big Win
Needham led the Menlo array with
11 and 10 points while Jack Dana
continued his high point antics for
the Frosh with six nifty field goals.
In the Paly High affair, Stanford got
off to an early lead and led by
Stamm, who sank 17 points and
played an alert floor game, coasted
in after a 29-15 lead at half time.
Stamm looked as though he might
hold his post as a regular even after
lanky Ed Voss recovers from in
juries which kept him from most of
the action over the week-end. Be
sides Stamm, Jim McCaffrey turned
in good all-around performances,
and Henry Plate suddenly blossomed
into a capable reserve.

Menlo J. C. smashed the perfect
record of Stanford's freshman bas
ketball team Friday night when they
trounced the Frosh 41 - 33. The
Bulldogs hatted a late rally which
the Frosh five uncorked in the last
quarter, and won going away. Sat
urday night in a prelim for the var
sity clash with Pacific, the Frosh
conquered Palo Alto High easily,
43-29.
STARTS WELL
The IVlenlo game started off auspi
ciously for the yearlings, but with
the score 14-12 for the Frosh late in
the first half, the Bulldogs ran eight
straight tallies to lead 20-14 at the
midpoint. Opening the second half,
the Menlo five ran up ten more
points before Ross Meyer hit a free
throw for Stanford.
The Frosh then put on a spurt
of their own and ran up. a dozen
points to the Bulldogs' one. Jack
Dana, Henry Plate, James McCaf
frey and big Ed Stamm counted in
rapid-fire order and the Menlo club
found itself ahead only 25-32. The
Frosh had burned themselves out,
however, and Menlo closed with a
rush to win.
LATIIOS LEADS MENLO
Little Tommy Lnthos and big Win
Needham led the Menlo array with
11 and 10 points while Jack Dana
continued his high point antics for
the Frosh with six nifty field goals.
In the Paly High affair, Stanford got
off to an early lead and led by
Stamm, who sank 17 points and
played an alert floor game, coasted
in after a 29-15 lead at half time.
Stamm looked as though he might
hold his post as a regular even after
lanky Ed Voss recovers from in
juries which kept him from most of
the action over the week-end. Be
sides Stamm, Jim McCaffrey turned
in good all-around performances,
and Henry Plate suddenly blossomed
into a capable reserve.
