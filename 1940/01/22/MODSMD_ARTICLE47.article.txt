# Potential Inferno

### 
THAT Encina is a firetrap is an undeniable
fact.
It measures up to all the requirements for a
public tinderbox set up by T. Alfred Fleming,
Supervisor of the Conservation Department of
the National Board of Insurance Underwriters:
The interior is built of fast-burning material,
the stairways are highly combustible, and the
stair-wells provide dangerous vertical drafts
which would insure the spread of a fire once it
started.
There are only two fire-escapes on the whole
building, a condition worse than if there were
none. In case of an emeregncy, so many people
would dash for them that some certainly would
be crushed and trampled.
There is no automatic sprinkler system.
The fire extinguishers and alarms are con
stantly abused by freshman residents of the
hall so that they are not always in working
order.
The exit doors open inward.
Strange as it seems, the University made no
public recognition of its knowledge of these
conditions until last Friday. At that time it took
its first step in the right direction by announcing
that fire-escapes will be installed in Encina.
Fortunately it did not take the charred body
of a freshman to demonstrate to the University
what obviously needs to be done.
