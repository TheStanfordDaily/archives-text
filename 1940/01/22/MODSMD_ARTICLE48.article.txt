# Second Fiddle for the Czar
## 
### 
A LOCAL version of the Munich Conference
took place Friday afternoon in the B.A.C.
It was a meeting called to determine whether
the allegedly "all-star" Firehouse teams are eli
gible to compete in intramural sports.
And like the world-shaking parley of Sep
tember, 1938, this turned out to be only a tourni
quet on a bleeding wound, a postponement of
inevitable war.
After amicably conferring with the men who
polish the big red machines, Intramural Man
ager Andy Stojkovich and Coach Harry Wolter
declared that the fire laddies are perfectly free
to take part in any sport they sign up for.
However, no sooner had this happy conclu
sion been reached, without even a Czechoslo
vakia being depoiled, than the mural manager
promptly reiterated his convictions that the Fire
house is a bunch of all-stars and that it is bad
for competition to have them in the league.
"Under the present rules," he admitted, "they
are eligible, and there is nothing that we can
do about it."
As far as this season is concerned, the matter
is temporarily settled. But as soon as the Fire
house starts winning again, the same charges of
proselyting and semi-professionalism are bound
to recur. And next time it may mean a Blitzkrieg
instead of a Munich Pact.
Of course, this is the Firehouse's first suc
cessful year in intramural competition. The
boys easily may return to the cellar after a sea
son or two.
However, if Manager Stojkovich is correct in
his charge that the Firehouse's competing has
a bad effect on the league, something must be
done to remedy the sitution now—something
like changing the rules.
There is no more reason for allowing one
team to wreck the intramural set-up than there
is for disqualifying a team merely because it
wins too often.
