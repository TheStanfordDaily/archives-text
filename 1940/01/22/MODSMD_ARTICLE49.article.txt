# Leap Year Blues
## 
### 
AN incredibly ingenuous senior weeps gently
in today's Campus Opinion because no
one has asked him to the Sadie Hawkins dance.
This is a momentous year for that senior.
Sometime in his life he has learned about Santa
Claus and then about the stork, in that order.
And now he will learn about Leap Year.
He is not alone, of course. There are un
doubtedly other men hopefully waiting for
some blonde to bring romance into their lives
in the guise of bid to the Sadie Hawkins dance.
These men should learn, in the first place,
how such dances are planned.
Even at its inception this affair was not de
signed as a vehicle to pull Stanford out of its
dating rut and give the women a chance to go
out with the men they really wanted to go out
with (in guotation marks). It was planned to
make money, like all dances at Stanford.
But even more, this naive senior and his hope
ful friends should learn a little about Stanford
women. They should not forget that there are
three Stanford men for every Stanford woman.
The women never forget it.
Why, they say, should we ask anyone to
something as crude as the Sadie Hawkins dance

when we can be asked to the City that night?
Or any night?
And Stanford women (this is not characteris
tic of the wcnien exclusively) will not jump at
anything as apparently unsophisticated as the
old-clothes Sadie Hawkins dance.
If Stanford women are "queens," they are so
only in the minds of the hopefuls and in their
own minds. And even so, Queen Elizabeth was
the only queen in the last 500 years who would
ask a man for a date.
Also, these hopefuls should learn about Stan
ford, and the status quo. ('Way out West at
Stanford where they have the status quo, and
the only guy who can get a date is the one
who's in the know . . .)
But it is only fair to the women to say that
the hopefuls will be able to go to see "The
Warrior's Husband" next week and see how the
vice-versa really works. They won't like it.â€”
