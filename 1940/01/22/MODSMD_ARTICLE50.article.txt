TO ENJOY OR NOT TO ENJOY
CAN FRANCISCO audiences have been "enraptured"
by Maurice Evans 1 "Hamlet." The critics told us
that New Yorkers were thrilled by Evans. San Fran
ciscans themselves tell us that they are thrilled too.
There may be some connection between what the
critics told San Franciscans they ought to feel and
what San Franciscans say they did feel.
But most of the enthusiasm for Maurice Evans is
undoubtedly genuine. People really like the noble
tone of voice, the "beautiful" quality with just a sug
gestion of pump-throb.
Equally genuine, however, is the concensus among
Stanfordites who saw the play that they were not so
thrilled by Evans' interpretation of The Bard. Here,
then, we have a real divergence of taste. Why should
Stanford theatergoers disagree with San Franciscans
and New Yorkers, and with the "critics"? Maybe be
cause we are just ignorant. But most of us like to
think that there is a more pleasant reason.
The traditional "Hamlet" is declaimed rather than
acted. With many a sentimental lilt and melodra
matic gesture, actors have been Hamlet and Macbeth
and Othello with a type of "power" that suggests,
"This is the immortal work of the Bard, and I have a
beautiful voice!"

TVTOW perhaps we should enjoy that sort of drama
if we are to rank with the apostles of culture. But
the question, "To enjoy or not to enjoy" should really
be settled on other grounds than the word of the en
throned critics. And so some of us who saw Maurice
Evans feel that we have a right to stick out our youth
ful and unauthoritative necks and say that we would
rather have Hamlet acted than orated.
To many Shakespearean authorities the suggestion
that the orthodox "Hamlet" is not the best or most
genuinely dramatic one is heretical. "That's Shake
speare," they say.
In the face of such stalwart opposition to the dra
matic tastes of "this younger generation," it is re
freshing to take Dr. Margery Bailey's course in
"Shakespeare." There one finds an amazing phenom
enon: An English professor who doesn't go for the
Shakespearean melodrama that "high school students
imitate at Saturday afternoon festivals," as she puts it.
So cultural heretics like us Stanford students, who
didn't think Evans' lyric voice made up for his af
fected tone, need not despair. Critics may be profes
sorial. But, fortunately, all professors are not pro
fessorial.
I saw Dr. Bailey at the fights Thursday nightâ€”an
encouraging sign in itself. "I'm going to see Evans
Saturday night," she said, "but I'm not expecting too
much." And then, "Do you think there will be any
more good fights?"
That is a specific wind of freedom.
