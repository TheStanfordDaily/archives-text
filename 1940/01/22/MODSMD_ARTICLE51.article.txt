# CAMPUS OPINION
## THE
						GHOST TALKS 
### 
THE EDITOR, SIR:
The reports of our death are greatly exaggerated,
I hasten to assert on behalf of the Stanford Radio Club
in reply to the Excom's announced intention to dis
solve our organization. The Radio Club is definitely
active—we have three officers and practically fifteen
members, among them some of the finest minds in the
Engineering Department.
We have a new clubhouse, new transmitters, new
antennas, and five dollars in the treasury. If that
isn't achievement, I'd ilke Mr. Cobbs to show me one.
Furthermore, if Mr. Cobbs had read the Dippy of
the day before, he would have seen definite evidence
of our existence. If Mr. Cobbs wants more proof, we
would be glad to oblige—in our own way. Would
Mr. Cobbs like to inspect our five thousand volt power
supply?
Oswald G. Villard, Jr.
President, Stanford Radio Club
