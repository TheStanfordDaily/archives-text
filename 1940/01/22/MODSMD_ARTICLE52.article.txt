# HURRY UP, GIRLS

r pi-IE EDITOR, SIR:
I thought this year was supposed to be Leap
Year? What is the matter with the Stanford women
then?
For a week, The Daily has announced the "Sadie
Hawkins Hop" on Jan. 27. I was at the A.S.S.U. office
this afternoon and discovered only five bids have been
sold to women. No, I'm not chairman of the dance.
In fact, I'm a senior and have nothing to do with the
actual dance. I'm merely trying to discover why Stan
ford co-eds who in the past have accused the Stanford
men of being "slow," aren't getting their dates any
faster now that they have their chance. Talk about
being slow—the women look like a bunch of bashful
"Mortimer Snerds" in comparison to us.
If for no other reason, the women ought to take
us to this dance as a matter of courtesy. We, the
men, have been taking out the gals for quite a few
years now. I think we are entitled to being the invited
ones at least once during Leap Year.
* * * #
|F THE women plan on waiting until the last minute
to ask us, I advise them to change their plans.
After all, don't we have to call their Majesties, the
"Stanford Queens" (?) two weeks in advance in order
to get a date? We ought to be able to demand the
same right and privilege.
Maybe the Stanford women are too modest to ask
us—l doubt it! They're probably afraid of losing a
little pride to ask a man for a date. If this is the truth,
they had better get off their high horses and get to a
telephone. It's a matter of choosing beween holding
your pride or your men, girls!
So far, I think your pride has been on the winning
side. Here's your chance to make a big hit with that
boy you're particularly interested in, I hope the girl
I'm interested in seeing this.

sold to women. No, I'm not chairman of the dance.
In fact, I'm a senior and have nothing to do with the
actual dance. I'm merely trying to discover why Stan
ford co-eds who in the past have accused the Stanford
men of being "slow," aren't getting their dates any
faster now that they have their chance. Talk about
being slow—the women look like a bunch of bashful
"Mortimer Snerds" in comparison to us.
If for no other reason, the women ought to take
us to this dance as a matter of courtesy. We, the
men, have been taking out the gals for quite a few
years now. I think we are entitled to being the invited
ones at least once during Leap Year.

|F THE women plan on waiting until the last minute
to ask us, I advise them to change their plans.
After all, don't we have to call their Majesties, the
"Stanford Queens" (?) two weeks in advance in order
to get a date? We ought to be able to demand the
same right and privilege.
Maybe the Stanford women are too modest to ask
us—l doubt it! They're probably afraid of losing a
little pride to ask a man for a date. If this is the truth,
they had better get off their high horses and get to a
telephone. It's a matter of choosing beween holding
your pride or your men, girls!
So far, I think your pride has been on the winning
side. Here's your chance to make a big hit with that
boy you're particularly interested in, I hope the girl
I'm interested in seeing this.
Signed,
A Hopeful Senior
