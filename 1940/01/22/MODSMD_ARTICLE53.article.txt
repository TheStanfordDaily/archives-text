"SEVEN CENTURIES OF PAINT
ING an exhibit of great European
and American art, is on display un
til Jan. 28 at the M. H. DeYoung
Museum in Golden Gate Park and
the Palace of the Legion of Honor
in Lincoln Park in San Francisco.
This magnificent collection ar
ranged by Dr. Walter Heil from the
European paintings exhibited at the
New York World's Fair and import
ant private collections, undoubtedly
surpasses any other that has been
shown in recent years in Northern
California, with the possible excep
tion of the old masterpiece shown
on Treasure Island.
Tlie only reason the exhibition is
hung in two different museums is to
cut the tremendous cost of insur
ance on the paintings. Although
each of the galleries contains can
vasses arranged from the fourteenth
to the twentieth century, the dis
play is supposed to be viewed as a
single unit, according to Dr. Heil.
MADONNA' SHOWN
Among the most famed pictures
in the collection are Van Eyek's
"Ince Hall Madonna," a miniature
masterpiece of jewel-like craftsman
ship and loving detail, and Ver
meer's "Milkmaid," a perfect image
of the cool repose and contented
domesticity of the Dutch people
which too often has been badly re
produced on calendars.
El Greco's fervently emotional
"Pieta," a loan from a private col
lection in Paris, is one of the finest
things the exhibition has to offer,
and the thrilling "St. John the Bap
tist" by the same master is almost
as great.
Included in the display are half a
dozen Rembrandts, of which the best
is his telling, incisive character
study, "Head of Christ." Outstand
ing examples of Italian Renaissance
painting are two Titians and a
Tintoretto. Particularly charming,
though perhaps not as spectacular
as some, is a tiny primitive "Cruci
fixion" of the fourteenth century by
Daddi.
The works of the French Impres

sionist school are well represented
by a number of fine Renoirs, Degas,
Van Goghs, Manets, and Monets.
Also a group of brilliant Cczannes
are hanging at the Legion of Honor.
Among contemporary paintings,
Grant Wood's "Daughters of the
American Revolution," a biting satire
on middle-aged club women, has
aroused the most interest and com
ment. Another controversial picture
which is on exhibit is Thomas Ben
ton's luscious nude "Persephone,"
which was banned from galleries
when it first was hung in Kansas.
And there are several works by
Dali and other surrealists for those
whose minds run that way.
"Seven Centuries of Painting"
claims just a bit more than this ex
hibition includes, for it is weak in a
few important departments. But on
the whole, particularly in the Dutch,
impressionist, and contemporary
schools, it is one of the greatest art
displays that has ever visited San
Francisco.â€”L. L.
