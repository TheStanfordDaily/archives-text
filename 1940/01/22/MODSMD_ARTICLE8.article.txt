# Boathouse Closed For Rest of Week
## 
### 
Contrary to a report issued last
week, the boathouse will not be open
to students this week, according to
an announcement made by John
Cobbs, student manager.
The rowboat, property of the
University which is used in
life saving, was stolen up at Felt
Lake last summer and must be re
placed before the lake can be offi
cially opened. Also, all floating
timber must be taken from the lake
by life guards, and the water is too
cold for anyone to go in yet., said
Cobbs.
