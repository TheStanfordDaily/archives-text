### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
A CLERK is busily at work in a
deserted committee room of the
Capitol building.
With screwdriver in hand, he
bends over a battered oak table. Fi
nally he straightens. He looks at the
small, shiny object in his hand.
Carefully he wraps it in tissue pa
per, places it in a box. Addressing
it and tieing it securely, he drops
it in a capitol mail-box.
This small, shiny thing which
occupied the obscure clcrk's at
tention for a few minutes yester
day afternoon in that quiet room
was a brass plate. On it were en
graved the words "William Edgar
Borah." For 28 years it had
adorned Borah's place in the For
eign Relations Committee table
where he had sat in varying ca
pacities. Yesterday it was on its
way to Mrs. Borah, a memento of
her husband's distinguished ca
reer.
And the body of William Borah
was en route to Boise, Ida., after
the nation had paid homage to him
at a solemn but simple state funeral
in the Senate Chamber, where he
rose to world fame. At yesterday's
rites for the 75-year-old statesman
who died Friday night, President
Roosevelt, Chief Justice Charles Ev
ans Hughes and members of the Su
preme Court, diplomats, cabinet of
ficers, his Senate colleagues, mem
bers of the House and other digni
taries gathered in somber array to
pay him tribute.
jpoii three hours before the start
of the unpretentious service, the
body of the Senate dean lay in state,
with the casket closed. At 12:15
Vice-President Garner convened the
chamber and then instructed at
tendants to bring in the invited
guests. Mr. Roosevelt was the last
to take his seat. The services lasted
25 minutes.
As the chaplain of the House
intoned the familiar words, "I am
the Resurrection and the Life,"
Mr. Roosevelt, his face grave, sat
with bowed head, his fingers
clutching the black-bordered fu
neral program. After the last
"Amen" had sounded in the hush
ed chamber, the mourners filed
out slowly, led by Mr. Roosevelt.
The diplomatic corps moved down
the center aisle and each member
bowed his head as be passed the
casket.
$ * *
r JMIE galleries and the chamber
were crowded, save for the va
cant desk and chair where Borah
held independent sway for 33 years.
A spray of red roses lay across the
desk. At 5 o'clock the casket was
carried down the capitol steps,
through a double line of police who
stood at attention with their hands
raised in salute. An escort of mo
torcycle police preceded the hearse
on the short journey to Union sta
tion.
The congressional delegation ac
companying the body back to
Boise, where another funeral
service will be held Thursday,
consisted of ten Senators—five Re
publicans and five Democrats—and
ten members of the House, five
Democrats, four Republicans, and
one Progressive. The gray steel
casket was placed in a special car
attached to a train which left at
(» o'clock last night for the long
journey.

In a sense, a distinct era of Con
gressional history came to an end
with Borah's death. His 33 years in
the Senate bridged a transitional
period in American life. Conserva
tive, often prejudiced, he was one
time chairman of the Foreign Rela
tions Committee, even though he
had never crossed the borders of
(he United States. A staunch iso
lationist, he saw his country in
volved in a great European war, died
as his nation looked across the At
lantic at another struggle develop
ing into savage, bitter slaughter.
