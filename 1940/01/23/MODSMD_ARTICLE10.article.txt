# Vocom to Answer Women's Queries
## 
### 
Questions submitted to Vocom
this week for replies at the "In
formation Please" on writing next
Thursday indicate that the field will
be approached from many angles,
according to Virginia Meserole,
Vocom chairman.
Several cards have been returned
asking for specific advice on how to
submit manuscripts to magazines
and another card asks just what, type
of material should be submitted.
These and other questions will be
dealt with by the board of experts
under the chairmanship of Miss
Edith Mirrielees, professor in the
English department.
Mrs. Hazel Pedlar Faulkner, who
will be on the board, is well known
for her activities in San Francisco
in the capacity of publicity director
for the women's division of both the
recent Fair and the Republican
County Central Committee. Mrs.
Kathleen Cassidy Doyle, also on the
board, was formerly society reporter
for the San Francisco Examiner.
