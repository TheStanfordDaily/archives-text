# Deadline for Quad Photos Set Today
## 
### 
Today is the last day in which
fraternity, sorority, dormitory, or
eating club members may have pic
tures taken for the 1940 Stanford
Quad, according to Newton Russell,
editor.
The Quad studio was reopened for
a few days to enable newly pledged
fraternity members to be photo
graphed. Organizations scheduled
for today are Delta Upsilon, Delta
Kappa Epsilon, Phi Sigma Kappa,
Roble Club, and Japanese Club.
Other students who have failed to
do so may also have their pictures
taken any time today.
The photographer will be in the
Quad office from 9 to 12 o'clock this
morning and from 1 to 5 o'clock
this afternoon.
