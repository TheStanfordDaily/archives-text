# British Get Three Notes Of Protest
## U.S., Japan, Holland Object to Breaches Of Neutrality Law 
### United Press 
Great Britain was revealed Mon
day as being on the receiving end of
protests from three nations—Japan,
the United States and the Nether
lands —in connection with her meth
ods of prosecuting the war against
Germany.
These diplomatic troubles of His
Majesty's government overshadowed
the actual fighting on Europe's bat
tle fronts, which included more ship
losses, almost complete inactivity on
the snow-bound western front, and
reported continued successes by
Finnish troops against the Russians.
The Japanese government en
tered the picture with a sharp pro
test to Britain over action of a Brit
ish warship in removing from the
Japanese liner Asama Maru 21 Ger
man sailors who were returning to
Germany. The Japanese described
this as an "unfriendly act" and
served notice that the government,
"reserves the right in advance" to
demand return of the Germans.
RETALIATION FEAREI)
Possible retaliation by Japanese
seizure of British merchant shipping
in Far Eastern waters unless Brit
ain gives satisfaction was seen in this'
matter.
In London, it was said unofficially
that the British government prob
ably would reject the protest, ex
plaining that Germany set a prece
dent by seizing British sailors from
neutral craft. It was pointed out
that Japan already had been noti
fied that British warships would stop
Japanese ships carrying German
sailors as passengers and seize those
Gerntans of military age.
The new British difficulty with the
United States involved a charge that
American ships passing through the
Straits of Gibraltar were delayed
three times as long as Italian vessel.-;
by British blockade authorities. Sec
retary of State Cordell Hull said in
the note that his government ex
pects "the British government will
at least take suitable and prompt
measures to bring about immediate
correction of this situation."
REJECT U.S. CLAIM
The British government recently
rejected a United States contention
that Britain was violating interna
tional law by examining the U.S.
mails.
Regarding this latest American
protest, it was said in London by
Foreign Office officials that there
had been no discrimination against
American ships and that if the Italian
vessels cleared the blockade more
rapidly it probably was because the
latter complied more fully with the
system whereby manifests of ships.'
cargoes are deposited with British
consular officials before sailings.
The Netherlands protest was sent
to Germany as well as to Britain,
calling attention of these countries
to the fact that Dutch neutrality was
violated Monday by British and Ger
man warplanes flying over Nether
lands territory. The British Air
Ministry said that a check revealed
that no British planes could have
been involved.
