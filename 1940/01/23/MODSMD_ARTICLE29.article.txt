# Jury Convicts Earl Browder On Two Counts
## U.S. Communist Get Four-year Sentence On Passport Frauds 
### 
NEW YORK. Jan. 22 (UP).â€”Earl
Browder, the nation's No. 1 Com
munist, today was convicted of pass
port fraud and sentenced imme
diately to four years imprisonment
and fined $2,000.
The middle class jury which con
victed him in a four-day trial, fea
tured by a conclusion in which
Browder addressed the jurors in his
own behalf, required but 45 min
utes to announce its verdict after
receiving the case from Judge Alfred
Coxe.
Pending appeal, the Communist
general secretary's bail of $7,500 was
continued until Wednesday. Judge
Coxe, anxious to speed the case to a
conclusion, said he was continuing
the bail with the understanding j
Browder would perfect his appeal
before Wednesday.
FALSE REPRESENTATION
Browder presented no evidence
against the charge, which alleged on
two counts he used a passport ob
tained in 1934 on a false representa
tion that he had not previously had
a passport.
The government established on
three previous occasions, extending
back to 1921, he had used passports
in the names of Nicholas Dozenberg, |
George Morris, and Albert Henry
Richards, that he had been seen
twice in Mosco\v on occasions when
he had no passport in his own name,
ynd that in 1937 and 1938 he used
the 1934 passport, obtained in his
own name, to enter this country.
Though he did not testify and
presented no other witnesses, Brow
der made a surprise appearance be
fore the jury of 11 men and a
woman, substituting for his chief
counsel, George Gordon Battle, in
summation of the defense case.
SPEAKS FOR SELF
He spoke at first quietly observing
he was a "correspondence school
lawyer," but as his address continued
he was nettled frequently by inter
ruptions of U. S. Attorney John T.
Cahill and Judge Coxe, who cau
tioned him frequently he must not
discuss the law of the case, which
was the court's province, but only
the facts. Toward the end of his
summation Browder was shouting
and pounding his fist on the rail of
the jury box.
Browder might have been sen
tenced to a total of ten years' im
prisonment and $4,000 fine. Cahill,
recalling he previously had been
convicted of evading the World War
Draft Act and served two years in
Leavenworth Penitentiary, asked for
a total of five years imprisonment
and $5000 fine. The judge reduced
this, making it a sentence of two
years and $1,000 fine on each of the
two counts.
