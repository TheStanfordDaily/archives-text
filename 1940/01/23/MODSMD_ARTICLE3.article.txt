# Poll Upholds 'No Smoking' As Tradition
## Sentiment, Low Fire Rates Considered As Living Groups Vote 
### 
Representatives of the Farm's liv
ing groups voted informally and
unanimously yesterday to uphold
the 49-year-old tradition of no
smoking on Quad. The discussion
will be continued in the meeting of
Executive Committee tonight.
Reasons for the desire to continue
the non-tobacco policy as given by
Women's Conference, Men's Council
and various living groups were prac
tical or sentimental. For the sake
of the tradition itself, it was put
forward (3) that Mrs. Stanford's ex
pressed the wish that students
would never smoke on Quad, (2)
that Stanford's first student body
voted against smoking on Quad one
week after classes began and (3)
that David Starr Jordan endorsed
the policy.
Practical backing was given to
the tradition on the score that (1)
Stanford Quad is attractive because
of being free from cigarette butts
and (2) fire insurance rates for the
University buildings are lower be
cause of reduced fire hazards.
QUAD FIRE RATE LOW
Commenting upon this last point,
the office of the Comptroller de
clared yesterday that while "it can
not be said that Stanford insurance
premiums are lower because of the
student practice of not smoking on
the Quadrangle, it is usually true
that insurance rates in general are
based on fire experience." The Quad,
the office added, has had a very low
fire rate, perhaps because of the
tradition.
Bob Putnam, president of Men's
Council, said that the group will
recommend to Ex Committee that
the students themselves continue the
practice, but that no remedy will
be proposed.
TRADITION SUPPORTED
An informal show of hands put
Women's Conference on record as
upholding the tradition, and it was
suggested that the feeling of the
conference be reported by Coline
Upshaw and Anne Townsend, both
of whom were appointed last week
by A.S.S.U. President Ken Cuth
bertson to investigate the practice
and its violations, to the student
body committee tonight. The reso
lution, as far as the women's living
groups are concerned, will be left
to Ex Committee.
The consensus was that any en
forcement other than individual de
sire to conform would be "unneces
sary and useless."

Stanford Quad is attractive because
of being free from cigarette butts
and (2) fire insurance rates for the
University buildings are lower be
cause of reduced fire hazards.
QUAD FIRE RATE LOW
Commenting upon this last point,
the office of the Comptroller de
clared yesterday that while "it can
not be said that Stanford insurance
premiums are lower because of the
student practice of not smoking on
the Quadrangle, it is usually true
that insurance rates in general are
based on fire experience." The Quad,
the office added, has had a very low
fire rate, perhaps because of the
tradition.
Bob Putnam, president of Men's
Council, said that the group will
recommend to Ex Committee that
the students themselves continue the
practice, but that no remedy will
be proposed.
TRADITION SUPPORTED
An informal show of hands put
Women's Conference on record as
upholding the tradition, and it was
suggested that the feeling of the
conference be reported by Coline
Upshaw and Anne Townsend, both
of whom were appointed last week
by A.S.S.U. President Ken Cuth
bertson to investigate the practice
and its violations, to the student
body committee tonight. The reso
lution, as far as the women's living
groups are concerned, will be left
to Ex Committee.
The consensus was that any en
forcement other than individual de
sire to conform would be "unneces
sary and useless."
Representatives of the Farm's liv
ing groups voted informally and
unanimously yesterday to uphold
the 49-year-old tradition of no
smoking on Quad. The discussion
will be continued in the meeting of
Executive Committee tonight.
Reasons for the desire to continue
the non-tobacco policy as given by
Women's Conference, Men's Council
and various living groups were prac
tical or sentimental. For the sake
of the tradition itself, it was put
forward (3) that Mrs. Stanford's ex
pressed the wish that students
would never smoke on Quad, (2)
that Stanford's first student body
voted against smoking on Quad one
week after classes began and (3)
that David Starr Jordan endorsed
the policy.
Practical backing was given to
the tradition on the score that (1)
Stanford Quad is attractive because
of being free from cigarette butts
and (2) fire insurance rates for the
University buildings are lower be
cause of reduced fire hazards.
