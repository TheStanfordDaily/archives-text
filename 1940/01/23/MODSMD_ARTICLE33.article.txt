# N.S.F.A. Urges Vocational Aid
## Guidance Stressed at Meeting 
### 
The need for adequate vocational 1
guidance in education in the face of
serious unemployment among col- i
lege students was stressed at the re- !
cent congress of the National Fed- i
eration of America, held at the Uni- '
versity of Minnesota.
Discussing problems from world l
politics to student government, dele
gates voted that salaries should not j
be paid to student officers. It was ;
thought that such a move would lead ,
to an increase in campus graft and <
political connivance.
OPPOSE DIES GROUP
The congress opposed the methods
of the Dies committee as "entertain- |
ing witnesses of only one point of
view, using discredited witnesses. ,
issuing faulty subpoenas, and nar
rowing investigation to a few groups |
instead of to all groups."
Unanimously approved was the |
work ol the National Youth Admin- :
istration, and consideration of an j
increase in the NYA appropriation •
was urged. Federal aid to education ,
was described as "necessary for the i
preservation of our democracy," j
but strong warning was sounded ;
against federal control of education
al policies.
MAINTAIN PEACE HERE
The delegates resolved that the
United States should not partici- |
pate in war, either with military or j
economic aid. "Our great, obliga- j
tions," they said, "are to maintain
peace here, and to preserve our j
democratic institutions." The con- :
gress agreed that the United States I
should lead the neutral nations in
world peace negotiations.
Student health programs were
declared inadequate, and the dele
gates recommended changes.
