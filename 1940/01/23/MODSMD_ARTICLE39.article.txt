# Troy Enters Card Series As Favorite
## S.C. Has Undefeated Record; Don Williams Nears Scoring Lead 
### 
Stanford's surprising basketballers j
have applied for and undoubtedly j
will get (he role of underdog in |
their all-important cage series with |
Southern California this week-end.
The Indians' claim to this role
hinges primarily on the record of the
Trojans. Sam Barry's quintet, first
of all, entered the Southern Division
race co-favorites with California to
win the crown.
liOTII RECORDS GOODS
They exploded the Bear myth
two week-ends ago with a set of
victories, 49-36, and 56-49. Then
Stanford further lowered the boom
on Nibs Price's defending champs,
55-32, last Friday night.
El Trojan has a record of an un
defeated season to date, including
a string of victories on their eastern
and mid-western barnstorming tour
Christmas vacation. Stanford's won
and lost record on their own trip
was just about as good, but the In
dians failed to meet any team the
Trojans did. Thus there is no com
parison to draw between the two
with the exception of using Cal as i
the guinea pig.
INDIANS SET I OR TROY
Although underdogs, Stanford's!
chances of tripping U.S.C. haven't
been shelved entirely. In fact, the j
Indians will be "set" for the Tro- |
jans and may be able to split the j
series. An undefeated team like the j
Trojans usually makes a pretty |
good target for teams like the i
Cards.
Ralph Vaughn, ace forward of El
Trojan and the man Ken Davidson j
will have to watch Friday and Sat- 1
urday, is still the conference's lead- |
ing scorer, although Jackie Robin- j
son of U.C.L.A. and Don Williams
pared his lead considerably.
WILLIAMS' AVERAGE HIGH
Held to but two field goals by j
U.C.L.A. but sinking seven foul j
shots, Vaughn brought his total to j
50 points. However, Robinson out- !
scored him in the fiasco down south '
to advance to 48 points. Williams j
worked his way up to 45 points with !
15 digits against Cal. Williams leads j
in the number of field goals with 20. j
as against 17 for Vaughn and Rob- j
inson.
Besides Williams, Davidson, Bill |
Cowden, and Fordy Anderson were
listed ,by Don Liebendorfer, official j
scorer of the conference, among the j
first 10. Davidson is in sixth place, j
with 29 points, just a point behind j
Bill Biggerstaff of the Bears. Cowden j
has 22 and Anderson has 17.
