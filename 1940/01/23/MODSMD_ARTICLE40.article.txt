SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 22 (UP).
â€”James Edward' (Jimmy) Britt, 60,
one of San Francisco's best-known
sports figures who once claimed the
world's lightweight boxing title, was
found dead today, apparently of
heart disease.
The body was found on the floor
of Britt's Apartment by his mother,
Mrs. Mary E. Britt. She summoned
Dr. Benjamin Hagan, who said Britt
apparently had been dead at least
a day.
During his prize-fighting career,
Britt fought such boxers as Joe
Clans, Battling Nelson, Young Cor
bett (Rothwell), Jabez White, Kid
Lavigne, and Toby Irwin, now a
referee in Oakland.
