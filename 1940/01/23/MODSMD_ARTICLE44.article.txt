### MIKE NEAL 
(Editor's Note: Mike Neal takes
over this galley of type today to
eulogize a man who has eulo
gized himself by his own ex
ploits.)
Last December when the experts
were holding forth on the respective
merits of the conference basketball
teams and their chances in the race,
Stanford's cagers found themselves
cast in much the role that the Farm
football team played.
They were a team that "might"—
they might stage an upset or two by
beating S.C. or California and thus
make the conference race more in
teresting; they might even scramble
into a tie for second; but they were
definitely inferior to the Bear in the
north and the Trojan in the south,
Their logical position come March
would be in third place.
The season got under way and
what has happened since is too re
cent history to repeat here. It's
enough to say that to date the In
dians have dropped only one game
and that by one point while their
victories have left no doubt as to
who was the better team.
Last Friday night, the crowd
trailing from the Encina Pavilion
was as of one mind 011 what they
had just seen—Stanford's almost
unbelievable humbling of the erst
while mighty Bear — "What a
coach!"
This tribute to Everett Dean's
wizardry was in no way a reflection
on the ability of the Indian players;
rather it was an acknowledgment
of the fact that Stanford had won
because its teamwork was the bet
ter, because its plays were masked
and set up more cleverly, and lastly
because it had demoralized the Cal
attack by making the Bears, when
I hey did get control of the ball, fight
to work it even past midcourt, in
short, because the Cards were better
coached.
Now this writer is a newcomer
to the Farm and hails from Michi
gan, which lies in the confines of
the Big Ten. In that far-off con
ference the annual opinion when
December rolls around is that any
team that can stop Indiana and
Purdue will win the casaba title
hands down, and to these sensi
tive cars have come whisperings
that the ancient mid western hat
tlecry of "Stop Indiana" is now
being raised in some of California's
seats of higher learning.
For Everett Dean is the latest to
come from that state of fabulous
basketball to join the ranks of Coast
Conference mentors and his present
edition of the Big Red Machine is in
a more-than-fair way to upset the
pre-season dope and the apple-cart
of his erstwhile rival in the East,
the Trojan's Sam Barry.
This week-end, Dean and Barry
will again take up a feud that was
resumed last year after an 11-year
lapse. Belore Barry followed How
ard Jones from lowa his squads
were often thorns in Hoosier sides
and to mid-westerners it will be like
old times to see the pair master
minding from opposite sides of the
court in a game that will decide a
conference championship.

the Big Ten. In that far-off con
ference the annual opinion when
December rolls around is that any
team that can stop Indiana and
Purdue will win the casaba title
hands down, and to these sensi
tive cars have come whisperings
that the ancient mid western hat
tlecry of "Stop Indiana" is now
being raised in some of California's
seats of higher learning.
For Everett Dean is the latest to
come from that state of fabulous
basketball to join the ranks of Coast
Conference mentors and his present
edition of the Big Red Machine is in
a more-than-fair way to upset the
pre-season dope and the apple-cart
of his erstwhile rival in the East,
the Trojan's Sam Barry.
This week-end, Dean and Barry
will again take up a feud that was
resumed last year after an 11-year
lapse. Belore Barry followed How
ard Jones from lowa his squads
were often thorns in Hoosier sides
and to mid-westerners it will be like
old times to see the pair master
minding from opposite sides of the
court in a game that will decide a
conference championship.

Last December when the experts
were holding forth on the respective
merits of the conference basketball
teams and their chances in the race,
Stanford's cagers found themselves
cast in much the role that the Farm
football team played.
They were a team that "might"—
they might stage an upset or two by
beating S.C. or California and thus
make the conference race more in
teresting; they might even scramble
into a tie for second; but they were
definitely inferior to the Bear in the
north and the Trojan in the south,
Their logical position come March
would be in third place.
The season got under way and
what has happened since is too re
cent history to repeat here. It's
enough to say that to date the In
dians have dropped only one game
and that by one point while their
victories have left no doubt as to
who was the better team.
Last Friday night, the crowd
trailing from the Encina Pavilion
was as of one mind 011 what they
had just seen—Stanford's almost
unbelievable humbling of the erst
while mighty Bear — "What a
coach!"
This tribute to Everett Dean's
wizardry was in no way a reflection
on the ability of the Indian players;
rather it was an acknowledgment
of the fact that Stanford had won
because its teamwork was the bet
ter, because its plays were masked
and set up more cleverly, and lastly
because it had demoralized the Cal
attack by making the Bears, when
I hey did get control of the ball, fight
to work it even past midcourt, in
short, because the Cards were better
coached.
