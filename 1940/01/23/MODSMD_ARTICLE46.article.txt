# Loss Fails to Halt Papoose Cagers
## 
### 
The Stanford frosh basketballers
lost their first game last Friday
I night when Menlo copped a 41-33
I victory, but that isn't going to slow
down the Papoose squad, according
j to Coach H. B. Lee.
Since there are no games for the
j frosh this week-end, practice will
| ease up a little during the week, but
j heavy work is scheduled again for
next week. Big Ed Stamm, who
| played exceptionally good brill when
| the Papoose quintet downed Paly
I High Saturday night, stands a good
I chance to keep the starting post
I given him when Ed Voss was in
; jured.
Jack Dana, whose point-making
kept the frosh. in the game last Fri
-1 day night, has shown himself to be
i a deadly one-hand shot, and at times
; looks like a potentially great eager.
