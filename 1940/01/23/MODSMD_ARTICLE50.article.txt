# Business School, El Campo Triumph in Mural Hoop Tilts
## 
### 
Intramural basketball rolled into
its second week in a very dull style.
The games were all low scoring and
not very interesting. The best game
of the evening was the triumph of
the Business School over the Japa
nese Club by a 23-13 count. Lin
Hamilton led- the Business five, ac
counting for 13 points. The Japanese
Club rallied in the second half and
pulled up within four points, but the
Business men used their superior
height to put the game on ice.
El Campo completely routed a sad
Alpha Sigma Phi team 32-6. The
outcome of the game was not in
doubt from the start. Seotty Craw
ford with 16 and Ed Rabjohn with
10 led El Campo in the score
column.
Out of the four Encina teams that
took the floor. Encina 3W looked the
best in scoring a 20-12 win over

been much higher but for the nu
merous substitutions.
