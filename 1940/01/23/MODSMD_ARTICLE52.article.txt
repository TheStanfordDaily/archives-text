# Neale Paces Frosh Netters
## 
### 
After four months of tennis on
j the Stanford courts, the frosh netters
\ stack, up about as they did last Sop
i tember. Jimmy Wade is now a
! sophomore, and as such will com
| pete for Coach Sherm Lockwood's
| varsity this spring. Wade is second
I only to Larry Dee on the varsity
j "ladder" and will probably team with
I him in doubles as the two have done
| so far this year.
With Wade no longer a freshman,
! the top frosh spot is being filled by
1 Emery Neale, recently elected cap
j tain for the coming season. Right
i behind Neale rank lanky Chuck
i Hutchinson from Los Angeles and
i diminutive Harper Ink, who does a
j remarkable job of court coverage
I for a man of his size.
Tom Kruger and Hal Lamb are
giving these boys plenty of compe
l tition. as is Carl Livingston, Penin
j sula flash.
These are the men at the top of
I the heap and they are being pressed
by a flock of promising tennis
; players, including Herb Nurmi of
Fresno, Clarence PeLss, Connecticut
; state doubles champ, Jim Frolik,
Jim Hodge and others.
I Japanese have reopened the iron
| mines in Chahar, North China.
