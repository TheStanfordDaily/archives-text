# The 						Comeback Trail

### 
FEW of Stanford's four thousand students
have ever come to the Farm because the
athletic teams here appealed to their innate
sense of hero worship. But there are probably
just as few of them who have relished the
thought of being razzed publicly for the
mediocrity of their major sport squads during
the past four years.
Being proud of Stanford is one thing, being
held responsible for dismal football and other
sports showings is another. That is probably
why Stanford men and women cheered and
smiled when Everett Dean s underdog basket
ball quintet so roundly thumped the defending
California Bear five last week-end.
The Stanford men and women probably
thought back to the days of the Laughing Boys
and Hank Luisetti, of the Vow Boys, and the
national championships of Dink Templeton's
many superior track squads. Maybe they felt
that this little basketball team of theirs is the
guiding light that will lead them along the come
back trail to athletic greatness.
If Stanford had no intercollegiate athletics at
all, the enrollment figures would probably drop
little or not at all, but as long as the Farm is a
part of the big time in the sports world (with
slim chance of any serious de-emphasis), it
doesn't hurt even a Stanford man's ego to ride
with a winner once in a while.
After all, when some heckler begins to rib
them about goose-eggs and grade-school per
formances, it probably does sound a bit silly to
say, "Yes, but our rat laboratory is among the
first five."—A. I.
