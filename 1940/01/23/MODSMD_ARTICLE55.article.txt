# No Bayshore on the Farm
## 
### 
THE rerouting of Palo Alto-bound traffic from
Palm Drive and University Avenue to Galvez
Street and the Embarcadero has led to more
complications than just the moving of the sta
tions for hitching rides to and from town.
Following the doubtful logic that when a
street becomes a main artery, its speed limit
automatically is increased, dozens of campus
drivers have been tearing up and down Galvez
as if it were the Bayshore Highway. And they
have not been getting away with it.
Gordy Davis and his ever-vigilant prowling
squad have been working overtime looking for
speeders on the new main drag, and they have
been passing out tags without restraint for any
thing over 25 miles per hour.
Yesterday an unusually large number of male
traffic violators plunked out their dollars at
Men's Council meeting. And next Thursday a
proportionate number of women law-breakers
will have to do the same thing.
Speeding on Galvez is not only extremely
dangerous, but it is the least pleasant way yet
devised for a student to waste his money. It
is even more fun to light a cigarette with a
dollar bill than it is to lay it down for a traffic
fine.
Therefore, add this to the code of the mythical
Stanford gentleman: He does not exceed the
25-miles-per-hour speed limit on Galvez Street.
And remember: He always stops at the
northeast corner of Galvez and Serra Streets,
by the Pavilion, to give hitch-hikers rides to
Paly, and at the northwest corner of University
Avenue and Emerson Street, across from the
bank, to bring them back to the Farm.
