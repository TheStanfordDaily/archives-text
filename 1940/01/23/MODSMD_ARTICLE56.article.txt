# On a Practical Level
## 
### 
NATIONAL student organizations seem to
possess a penchant for adopting resolutions
which are either so impractical as to be worth
less, or which, like the recent refusal of the
National A.S.U. to term Russia an aggressor in
Finland, are actually unintelligent.
But an encouraging new high in student reso
lutions was set in a series of decisions made
last month at the National Student Federation of
America Congress.
The Federation went on record as opposing
the methods of Congressman Martin Dies and
his committee in their ferret-like exposures of
those persons and organizations who, in Mr.
Dies' opinion, are a danger to our government.
The students then went on to "strongly en
dorse the idea of disclosing the purposes of and
revealing the activities of all political groups in
the United States," thus advocating the work
of the Dies investigation with none of the meth
ods of inguisition which that group employed.
Specifically, they scored the Dies probers
for "entertaining witnesses of only one point
of view, using discredited witnesses, issuing
faulty subpoenas, and narrowing investigation
to a few groups instead of to all groups.''
Immediately constructive, too, were resolu

tions passed urging an extension of inadequate
student health programs, an increased NY A
appropriation, and a furtherance of vocational
guidance in education.
These resolutions passed by the student con
gress are of practical, imminent value. They are
resolutions for the most part which delegates
to the conference can promote at their own
campuses. Action such as this can do much
to remove the bad flavor that the words "stu
dent conference" possess in the public's mouth.
