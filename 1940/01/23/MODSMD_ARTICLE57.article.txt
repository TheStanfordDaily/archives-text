### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
THE AMAZONS
r I' , HE Sadie Hawkins Dance and "The Warrior's Hus
band" are not only two of the year's outstanding
opportunities for entertainment. They are also two of
the year's outstanding experiments. The leap-year
dance is sponsoring the idea that women should ask
men for dates. And "The Warrior's Husband" shows
what happens if women get very aggressive with their
men.
At first thought Stanford men might quake at the
prospect of two such radical departures: A dance with
a feminine stag (or doe) line, and a play in which
the militant lady warriors rule the roost. But on sec
ond thought the Stanford male may really get interest
and satisfaction from the Leap Year Dance and the
Amazons. They both have possibilities.
The Sadie Hawkins affair has masculine value, of
course, in its financial aspects. Professor Fagan once
spoke of buying a dance-bid as the making of an in
vestment, upon which ample returns are usually ex
pected. Well, it is comforting to know that in this case
the women are making the investment, while we ex
pect the returns just the same. It is very true that the
expectation of returns may be doomed to disappoint
ment. That's a risk common to all ventures, fortunately
or unfortunately. But in this case the women pay,
whether the returns materialize or not.
As a matter of fact, since the women are making the
investment, it may be that the investment will be more
likely to bring returns.

\"OW "The Warrior's Husband" also has distinct mas
culine utility. It, is true that the Amazon women
really give their helpless men a rough time of it. But
it may not. be such a bad idea at all, from the mascu
line point of view, to hold up a little more vigorous
example to Stanford womankind.
And in the end, of course, a few of those Amazons
don't have it entirely their own way with the Greeks
in the play. Hippolyta's girdle may still be in the
hands of the Amazons at the end of the war. And
Hercules may not be strong enough to scare a good
Amazonian sergeant. ("Good" is not used in the moral
sense.) But a few of the Grecian warriors do carry
off a woman or two as a result of the battleâ€”even if
their fights do just begin with marriage.
So by a week from this Saturday night Stanford men
may not be in such a bad position at all. The women
can take us to the dance. And the Amazons can be
supreme in their own camp. But the men will end up
in the driver's seat. I'll wager.
Except for the three-to-one ratio.
