# THE 						FIREMAN AND THE CZAR

### 
r rilE EDITOR, SIR:
With Intramural Director Coach Harry Wolter
presiding over the Friday afternoon meeting between
the representatives of the Firehouse and Intramural
Manager Andy Stojkovich, several important facts
were brought to li«ht. The Firehouse was eligible for
intramural competition; there had never been any
doubt about it in the mind of Harry Wolter. It came
to light that the matter should have been taken up
with Director Wolter in the first place. Last but not
least, it was clearly evident the "Czar" Stojkovich
would admit nothing, denied everything.
The Firehouse apologizes to Coach Harry Wolter
for not taking the matter to him at the start, in view
of the fact that Director Wolter has the only authority
in such matters. But the Firehouse is sorry for the
"Czar," for it must have been uncomfortable to squirm
and deny every statement the Firehouse representa
tives made in regard to ineligibility. The Firehouse
is willing to accept Mr. Stojkovich's exhibition for what
it was, a rather crude and amusing attempt at face
saving.
The Firehouse sincerely hopes that no injury has
been done to the cause of intramural activities nor
to its fair and square director, for intramural activi
ties fill a very definite need at Stanford University.
The very fact that intramural activities have increased
three-fold in the last two years should be proof enough
of their place at Stanford. But. student managers of
the activities should not get themselves into face
saving situations.
Sincerely,
Tom Collins
