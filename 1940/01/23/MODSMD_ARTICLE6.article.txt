# STRICKLAND SEEKS 'GEMS'
## New Director Sets Brilliant Acting aw Goal 
### BUD AMES 
"And that will make it better for
you, Achilles."
Achilles had disappeared back
stage.
The voice of F. Cowles Strickland,
new director in the Division of
Speech and Drama, twanged again
out of the Memorial Hall darkness
from back around row B. It was the
fifth time that the actors had re
hearsed that little action for "The
Warrior's Husband"—but Mr. Strick
land gets what he wants.
"We'll just keep after those rough
spots and soon they will all be gems
of acting," he continued, advancing
down the aisle toward the stage. His
left hand was in his trouser pocket.
He seldom draws it out, even to
gesture.
DIRECTOR RESPECTED
Mr. Strickland's words are often
sarcastic, often a little bitter, but
they bring the desired results. His
student actors certainly respect him.
Never once during the rehearsal was
any nickname used. It was always
"Mr. Strickland."
"All right, BEGIN AGAIN."
This time he was good-naturedly
booming directions in the Shake
spearian tones of Maurice Evans,
whom he imitates frequently. And
he backed up the aisle again into
the darkness.
TEMPLE TAKES OVER
As business-like as he is, Mr.
Strickland still permits his "War
rior's Husband" cast frequent inter
missions for theatrical horsing
around. Something is always hap
pening.
The rehearsal started off last night
minus the leading man, Bucky Hen
shaw, who had bronchitis. So Jack
Temple—Shirley's big brother who
is assistant director and straight
fr»m Hollywood — stepped nto the
part. The rehearsal staggered on.

A few minutes later Bud Cady,
Stanford theater bigwig of a few
years ago, ambled nonchalantly onto
the stage, thus breaking up a dra
matic dissertation. Recognized Cady
was chased to backstage by a few
old friends for a round of hand
shaking. And the rehearsal went on.
"No, no, no," the voice of Mr.
Strickland twanged again from the
darkness. '"You say those lines like
an old Methodist minister. Yes, you
—Tilly-push."
Mr. Strickland has difficulty in
remembering names. Tilly - push
served the need of the moment.
The action was resumed, only to
be broken up a few minutes later
by assistant Jack Temple, who com
plained of tearing his trouser cuff.
Next Mr. Temple began to wave hi>;
arms about, confidentially describing
a certain dramatic action to a fellow
actor. The actor moved as he had
been directed.
"Are you boys waltzing?" Mr.

Strickland broke in—and the re
hearsal went on.
He forgets nothing, this Mr.
Strickland. Frequently he quotes
complete passages of one or all of
his actors. Once he threw himself
to the floor, blue suit and all, to
show the poet Homer exactly how to
fall when tripped by an Amazon.
And then the leading man ap
peared with a snuffy nose. Who
wouldn't with a leading lady like
Sylvia Berry?
And the rehearsal went on . . .
"And that will make it better for
you, Achilles."

TEMPLE TAKES OVER
As business-like as he is, Mr.
Strickland still permits his "War
rior's Husband" cast frequent inter
missions for theatrical horsing
around. Something is always hap
pening.
The rehearsal started off last night
minus the leading man, Bucky Hen
shaw, who had bronchitis. So Jack
Temple—Shirley's big brother who
is assistant director and straight
fr»m Hollywood — stepped nto the
part. The rehearsal staggered on.

A few minutes later Bud Cady,
Stanford theater bigwig of a few
years ago, ambled nonchalantly onto
the stage, thus breaking up a dra
matic dissertation. Recognized Cady
was chased to backstage by a few
old friends for a round of hand
shaking. And the rehearsal went on.
"No, no, no," the voice of Mr.
Strickland twanged again from the
darkness. '"You say those lines like
an old Methodist minister. Yes, you
—Tilly-push."
Mr. Strickland has difficulty in
remembering names. Tilly - push
served the need of the moment.
The action was resumed, only to
be broken up a few minutes later
by assistant Jack Temple, who com
plained of tearing his trouser cuff.
Next Mr. Temple began to wave hi>;
arms about, confidentially describing
a certain dramatic action to a fellow
actor. The actor moved as he had
been directed.
"Are you boys waltzing?" Mr.

Strickland broke in—and the re
hearsal went on.
He forgets nothing, this Mr.
Strickland. Frequently he quotes
complete passages of one or all of
his actors. Once he threw himself
to the floor, blue suit and all, to
show the poet Homer exactly how to
fall when tripped by an Amazon.
And then the leading man ap
peared with a snuffy nose. Who
wouldn't with a leading lady like
Sylvia Berry?
And the rehearsal went on . . .
"And that will make it better for
you, Achilles."
Achilles had disappeared back
stage.
The voice of F. Cowles Strickland,
new director in the Division of
Speech and Drama, twanged again
out of the Memorial Hall darkness
from back around row B. It was the
fifth time that the actors had re
hearsed that little action for "The
Warrior's Husband"—but Mr. Strick
land gets what he wants.
"We'll just keep after those rough
spots and soon they will all be gems
of acting," he continued, advancing
down the aisle toward the stage. His
left hand was in his trouser pocket.
He seldom draws it out, even to
gesture.
DIRECTOR RESPECTED
Mr. Strickland's words are often
sarcastic, often a little bitter, but
they bring the desired results. His
student actors certainly respect him.
Never once during the rehearsal was
any nickname used. It was always
"Mr. Strickland."
"All right, BEGIN AGAIN."
This time he was good-naturedly
booming directions in the Shake
spearian tones of Maurice Evans,
whom he imitates frequently. And
he backed up the aisle again into
the darkness.
