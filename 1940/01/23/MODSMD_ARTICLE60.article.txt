# 'ENLARGE OUR LOYALTY'

### 
[ r rHE EDITOR. SIR:
I have read with great interest the letters in this
column stating the case for individualism, as it was
presented by Hall and Row women and I would like
to point out something which seems to have been
overlooked.
There must, I suppose, be some geographical, if not
sociological, distinction between Hall and Row women,
by virtue of the fact that their Stanford homes are
separated. However, individuality has nothing to do
with that distinction. Perhaps it would be well to
remember that the University was founded for indi
vidual achievement, both intellectual and social, but
Hall or Row has absolutely nothing to do with this.
Perhaps also, it is idealistic to feel that we are all
Stanford students, living together as members of the
same University. This should be our strongest affilia
tion.
As for being anti-social: that becomes a very in
congruous idea when considering any concept of good
citizenship. Loyally to a group is an excellent and a
natural thing, but why not enlarge our loyalty a bit
and lie loyal to the Stanford group as a whole?
Isn't the important thing that we are all living in
the same community and sharing the privileges that
community has to offer? I may be wrong. I hope
that I'm not.
Sincerely.
