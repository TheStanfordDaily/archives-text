# 'Four Wives' Entertains Despite Baby Cavalcade
## 
### 
"FOUR WIVES," now playing at
the Fox Stanford.
If in a family blessed with four
charming daughters there can occur
within a very short time two wed
dings, a maternity false alarm, an
adoption, birth of a girl, and also
twins, then ours is truly an age of
remarkable speed.
But a movie with four leading
characters must have situations and
so in "Four Wives" the maternity
theme is utilized; even if the an
ticipations and arrivals of the off
spring are more than a little con
fusing.
STORY UNFOLDS
The story unfolds as if it were a
vital statistics column in a newspa
per: Gale Page, eldest sister, antici
pates a child, but learns that she
will never be able to have one, Lola
Lane, after adopting a girl, has twins
of her own. Priscilla, wife of John
Garfield, who died in "Four Daugh
ters," also becomes a mother and
marries Jeffrey Lynn. Only Rose
mary fails to visit the maternity
ward as a patient, but she marries
Eddie Albert, the doctor who de
livers her sisters' babies.
Regardless of illogical, confused
situations, "Four Wives" is thorough
ly enjoyable and much credit is due
to the very clever dialogue and di
rection, The photography was well
handled and as the Lemp family is
a musical one, music plays an im
portant and pleasing role.
"Four Wives" is extravagantly

cast with top-notch feature actors,
namely Claude Rains, May Robson,
Frank McHugh, and Dick Foran,
but a stage actor, Eddie Albert, takes
all the laurels for his convincing
performance, which possesses an un
usual amount of ease and natural
ness.
And now that the "Four Daugh
ters" have become "Four Wives," we
must patiently wait until they all
become "Four Mothers" — which is
their next picture.— Silverman
