# Tibbett Concert to Include Special Request Numbers
## 
### 
For the third time in the last ten years Stanford will bear its most
popular concert artist when I.<awrence Tibbett sings in Memorial Hall to
morrow evening on Ujc A.S.S.U. Concert Series.
Mr. Tibbett's program of German Lieder and American folk songs will
include by special request a selection of operatic arias which he seldom

sings in concert. i
Manager John Collins has an
nounced that tickets are on sale now
at the Concert Series office for seats
which have been set upon the stage.
Although "America's baritone"
has been singing Italian, French,
and German opera since his Metro
politan debut in 1925, he has much
to say regarding American opera for
the future.
OPERA IS BAD THEATER
He feels that the future of opera
in America depends on its adapta
tion to the strongly individual tastes
of the American public, and that it
must be given in English.
"Various aspects of production
must be revised," he continues.
"Americans abhor bad theater â€”
most current opera is ludicrous the
ater. In the matter of drama itself,
in the acting and in the staging, most
contemporary opera outrages the
highly discriminatory tastes of the
American theater-going public."
FOR AMERICAN OPERA
Favoring the development of a
larger repertoire of operatic works
by native composers and librettists,
he emphasizes its past success: "The
success of 'The King's Henchman,'
'Peter Ibbetson,' 'Emperor Jones,'
and 'Merry Mount' proves that
Americans can be just as responsive
to native works as are Germans,
Italians, Frenchmen and Russians."
Concluding his statements on the
future of opera in America, Mr. Tib
bett said, "It is illuminating to note
that in the past ten years no im
ported opera by a contemporary
composer has held the boards as
long at the Metropolitan as have the
four works just mentioned."
