### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
A ROUND the pivot of this Russo-
Finnish war revolves a greater
European conflict. It's easy to for
get that there are more fundamen
tal issues at stake than those which
the Soviets and the white-garbed
Finnish skiers are deciding up there
in the Arctic circle.
Before spring quarter the Allies
may send British and French volun
teers to Finland to bolster their in
fluence among the neutral nations.
You may remember that during the
Spanish Civil war—which seems a
long time ago and very small in
comparison to the present light—the
word "volunteer" became a syno
nym for an expeditionary force.
And that's probably what the Finn
ish episode will turn out to be.
This is another sign that Allied
policy is definitely moving in new
directions, far different from that
of last September when Britain
and France were trying to neu
tralize Russia or even win the
Soviets' benevolent neutrality.
The feeling is growing stronger
and stronger in Britain and France
that Russia is a potential encmv if
not already a "co-enemy" with
Germany. American opinion,
sympathizing so definitely with
Finland against Russia, and the at
titude of the Scandinavians and
other neutrals have buttressed this
attitude.
1(1 * *
IN the economic field, the Allied
contraband control of German
exports and imports falls far short
of a decisive blockade. While Eng
land continues to halt outbound
ships bearing Nazi goods intended
for the world market, she antag
onizes neutrals whose boats she de
lays. And, at the same time, prod
ucts are slipping into Germany from
unexpected sources. From Italy and
the Balkans, from Scandinavia, and
from other neutral areas the neces
sities of warfare are being supplied
the Nazis. There is scant hope of
bringing the Nazis to their knees
economically so long as Germany
enjoys continued access to these raw
materials and food markets.
Winston Churchill's somewhat
outspoken radio appeal last week to
the neutrals to "stand together
with the British and French em
pires against aggression and wrong"
seems to reflect England's convic
tion that the neutrals would not only
insure their own survial but would
shorten the war by siding with the
Alließ.
* * *
jfF the Allies were to react po
litely as England's bidding, the
development would compel the dis
persal of Germany's military forces
and deprive Germany of a great
many vital markets. Of course thus
could be true only if the neutrals
withstood pressure and possible vio
lence from the Nazfs.
The evolution of Allied policy is
a thing to behold. It. is most striking
in relation to Russia—and, hence, in
regard to Finland, too.
In September, 1938, Britain pro
posed to Moscow the opening of
commercial negotiations which, if
successful, would have diverted
Russian raw materials from Ger
many to the Allies and perhaps
would have led to a restoration
of political friendship among Mos
cow, Paris, and London. But the
English diplomats bungled the job
badly. They were left cooling their
heels in Joe Stalin's outer office
while German statesmen, includ
ing the cagey former champagne
salesman, Rihhcntrop, angled Ger
many into a solid spot. Stalin
ignored the Allied approaches and
drew closer to the Nazis.
And finally he signed the now re
nowned mutual consultation pact
with Germany, invaded Poland and
later, Finland. Even while London
was trying, in those early days of
the war, to make a friend of Russia,
France stood for a colder policy
toward the Soviets. Now the English
feci much the same way.

would have led to a restoration
of political friendship among Mos
cow, Paris, and London. But the
English diplomats bungled the job
badly. They were left cooling their
heels in Joe Stalin's outer office
while German statesmen, includ
ing the cagey former champagne
salesman, Rihhcntrop, angled Ger
many into a solid spot. Stalin
ignored the Allied approaches and
drew closer to the Nazis.
And finally he signed the now re
nowned mutual consultation pact
with Germany, invaded Poland and
later, Finland. Even while London
was trying, in those early days of
the war, to make a friend of Russia,
France stood for a colder policy
toward the Soviets. Now the English
feci much the same way.
A ROUND the pivot of this Russo-
Finnish war revolves a greater
European conflict. It's easy to for
get that there are more fundamen
tal issues at stake than those which
the Soviets and the white-garbed
Finnish skiers are deciding up there
in the Arctic circle.
Before spring quarter the Allies
may send British and French volun
teers to Finland to bolster their in
fluence among the neutral nations.
You may remember that during the
Spanish Civil war—which seems a
long time ago and very small in
comparison to the present light—the
word "volunteer" became a syno
nym for an expeditionary force.
And that's probably what the Finn
ish episode will turn out to be.
This is another sign that Allied
policy is definitely moving in new
directions, far different from that
of last September when Britain
and France were trying to neu
tralize Russia or even win the
Soviets' benevolent neutrality.
The feeling is growing stronger
and stronger in Britain and France
that Russia is a potential encmv if
not already a "co-enemy" with
Germany. American opinion,
sympathizing so definitely with
Finland against Russia, and the at
titude of the Scandinavians and
other neutrals have buttressed this
attitude.

IN the economic field, the Allied
contraband control of German
exports and imports falls far short
of a decisive blockade. While Eng
land continues to halt outbound
ships bearing Nazi goods intended
for the world market, she antag
onizes neutrals whose boats she de
lays. And, at the same time, prod
ucts are slipping into Germany from
unexpected sources. From Italy and
the Balkans, from Scandinavia, and
from other neutral areas the neces
sities of warfare are being supplied
the Nazis. There is scant hope of
bringing the Nazis to their knees
economically so long as Germany
enjoys continued access to these raw
materials and food markets.
Winston Churchill's somewhat
outspoken radio appeal last week to
the neutrals to "stand together
