# Campus Cooks Reveal Secrets
## Powers Behind Stove Air Culinary Tastes 
### BUD AMES 
A cross section picture of the
people who cook the food that feeds
the grey matter that produces those
A's—the Farm's cooks.
A house where Stanford men can
get a free meal and a place to air
their troubles regardless of their
ability to pay is the future hope of
Louise Joaquin, negress kitchen
commander at the Fiji house.
FROM LONG LINE OF COOKS
"How did I start cooking?" Louise
answered from behind her perpetual
smile. "If you ask a fat woman like
me that, there must be something
wrong."
She was born in Maryland, a
member of the Harris family, a clan
of negro farmers known through
out the South for their cooking. The
first school and Sunday school of
the district was started in Louise's
mother's kitchen. From there Louise
went to Storer College, where she
took courses in food value which
are standing her in good stead
today.
"And in my free time I take
Fanny Farmer cooking courses by
mail, and exchange recipes with
people," she added.
TIM'S PASTRY FAMOUS
Down the block Tim Fong, a Chi
nese who has been on the Farm 25
years, rules the Gamma Phi stove.
He got his start as second boy at the
Tri Delt house and 13 years ago
moved over to the Gamma Phis as
head man.
"They eat almost, as much as men,"
Tim confided with a gasping laugh.
He is always chuckling. "They like
fancy things; and I make all their
party and fancy stuff. Here—have
an eclair."
Canton, China, was Tim's birth
place, and he moved to San Fran
cisco at 15 with his parents. He's
been cooking, "oh, a very long, long,
long time." Chicken and rice are his
favorite dishes. Strange—who ever
heard of a Chinese who liked rice.
"I'm 47 years old in China and 46
in America," he explained. "Over
there you are a year old in January
even if you're born in December.
That makes a year's difference over
here."
We explained that that was the
same way that race horse ages were
measured—and he looked a little
hurt. Rather than risk interna
tional complications we left—
For the D.U. house, which is fed
by Ben Van Zandet, a negro who
tame from San Antonio, Texas, to
Stanford about three years' ago. Be
fore he came here, Ben acted as din
ing car cook on the Texas and Pa
cific R. R. for 27 months. The car
got "too hot for him" and he start
ed to catch colds, so he quit.
"I learned how to cook in the
army," Ben continued. "And say, I
got shot right through the leg when
I went down into Mexico with the
2-itli Infantry to capture Pancho
Vila in 191(>. See."
And he pulled up his left trouser
leg and proudly displayed two bullet
hole scars, one on either side of the
thigh just .'lbove the knee. Inci
dentally, he wears green garters.
"Roast beef and potatoes and
brown gravy are my favorites," he
added with a smile. "And I sure
like pies, especially lemon and
chocolate cream."
A wistful smile covered his face.
