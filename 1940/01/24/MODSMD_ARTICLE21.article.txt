# Excom Hits Quad Smoking But Votes Down Police Enforcement of Tradition
## Law Grails Called Worst Offenders: Former Scouts' Group to Handle Local 'March of Dimes' Campaign 
### DICK DUDMAN 
Recent controversy over the no-smÂ»king-on-thc-Quad tradition came
to a head last night as Ex Committee reached the following decisions:
(1) That there must he no formal policing to enforce this tradition.
(2) That law grads are the worst offenders and should he reminded

,of the tradition.
Quad smoking has been the sub
ject of discussion ever since two
members of Ex Committee reported
last week that the tradition was
breaking down, that cigarette stulx,
litter the Inner Quad.
PUBLICITY NO HELP
"Don't you think all the publicity
is having a good effect?" someone
asked .
"No," answered Coline Upshaw,
whose committee has been studying
the situation and polling campus
opinion on the subject during the
past week.
"We counted cigarette butts to
day and found 250 to 300 in front of
the law school and only a dozen or
so in front of each of the other de
partments. There even were some
empty packages in front of the
law school.
"I don't see why it's just the law
grads that do it. They must have
some legal reason they've figured
out."
SHARP LETTER PLANNED
Members of Ex Committee ap
proved a suggestion lhat a sharp
letter be sent to the law students,
"reminding them of the tradition
being observed elsewhere on the
campus."
The letter will be sent to the Law
School and the legal honorary so
cieties, it was decided.
Acting on a complaint that the
Library steps also were messy with
cigarette stubs, members authorized
the writing of a letter to Acting
Comptroller J. Hugh Jackson, asking
that sand-filled pots be located
there.
