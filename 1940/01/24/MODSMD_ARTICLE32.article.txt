### DOUGLAS GUY 
(Editor's Note: The much-op- \
pressed Stanford mermen swim
into Sideline Slants' special tank
today with Douglas Guy acting as
their publicity man.)
We spend most of our time trying
to get Jerry Mayer, regular "mayor" I
of this column, to find space for!
swimming stories.
It's not always so easy, not that
Jerry can't see swimming as a sport. :
but newspaper space is limited and j
every time something "hot"' comes j
up aver at Encina pool, something
"hot" comes up at the Firehouse, or I
some other place.
But now that Jerry is suffering
from hitch-hikersitis, a sore thumb,
and can't type, maybe we have ;
our chance.
Ferinstance. did you know that ;
newcomer Bayard Colyear, the j
new frosli backstroker, did 1:46 on j
his first whack at the
intercollegiate distance? Coach
Nort Thornton thinks that's swell, i
because all too often ace high !
m-Iimo! backstrokers are lost at the
added 50 yards.
Colyear clipped off a state record 1
of 1:03 for the 100 while in high
school in Long Beach. He must j
have had a time fighting his way '
past the Southern schools on his
way up here.
Then there's the all-Honolulu
fight going on between Pete Oku- :
moto and Co-Capt. Roy Vitousek. ;
The big blonde and the short dark
complectioned met for the first time '
in the interclass. Roy had to swim
under the 50 and 100-yard free ,
style marks he took the Big Meet in ;
last year to beat Pete.
The latter, you'll remember,
made his swim debut at Stanford
by winning the interclass events
in sensational times just a year
ago. Now lie's under Nort for bis
first varsity season and will be
one of the conference's best.
Another newcomer who is as
fast as a Hollywood >.hiek is Don
Smith. Smith hails from the local
Palo Alto High School, where he
set new records in the 100 and
220 at the Peninsula Athletic
League and North Coast Section of
the C.I.F. affairs.
Paly prep swimmers are among
the best in the state and Smith was
the best among them. He spent his
senior year running over to Stan
ford to get extra tips from Nort.
Even before coming to Palo Alto,
Smith was a star at Shanghai.
Now, as a frosh, he's the coast's
best at the 220 and 440. His time in
the latter event is already under
last year's Big Meet "best." Nort ex
pects him to hit the conference rec
ord before he's finished around here.
And he can do the breast-stroke and
backstroke, too.
All those other frosh free stylers
paddling through Encina waters are
San Franciscans, for the most part.

The big blonde and the short dark
complectioned met for the first time '
in the interclass. Roy had to swim
under the 50 and 100-yard free ,
style marks he took the Big Meet in ;
last year to beat Pete.
The latter, you'll remember,
made his swim debut at Stanford
by winning the interclass events
in sensational times just a year
ago. Now lie's under Nort for bis
first varsity season and will be
one of the conference's best.
Another newcomer who is as
fast as a Hollywood >.hiek is Don
Smith. Smith hails from the local
Palo Alto High School, where he
set new records in the 100 and
220 at the Peninsula Athletic
League and North Coast Section of
the C.I.F. affairs.
Paly prep swimmers are among
the best in the state and Smith was
the best among them. He spent his
senior year running over to Stan
ford to get extra tips from Nort.
Even before coming to Palo Alto,
Smith was a star at Shanghai.
Now, as a frosh, he's the coast's
best at the 220 and 440. His time in
the latter event is already under
last year's Big Meet "best." Nort ex
pects him to hit the conference rec
ord before he's finished around here.
And he can do the breast-stroke and
backstroke, too.
All those other frosh free stylers
paddling through Encina waters are
San Franciscans, for the most part.

pressed Stanford mermen swim
into Sideline Slants' special tank
today with Douglas Guy acting as
their publicity man.)
We spend most of our time trying
to get Jerry Mayer, regular "mayor" I
of this column, to find space for!
swimming stories.
It's not always so easy, not that
Jerry can't see swimming as a sport. :
but newspaper space is limited and j
every time something "hot"' comes j
up aver at Encina pool, something
"hot" comes up at the Firehouse, or I
some other place.
But now that Jerry is suffering
from hitch-hikersitis, a sore thumb,
and can't type, maybe we have ;
our chance.
Ferinstance. did you know that ;
newcomer Bayard Colyear, the j
new frosli backstroker, did 1:46 on j
his first whack at the
intercollegiate distance? Coach
Nort Thornton thinks that's swell, i
because all too often ace high !
m-Iimo! backstrokers are lost at the
added 50 yards.
Colyear clipped off a state record 1
of 1:03 for the 100 while in high
school in Long Beach. He must j
have had a time fighting his way '
past the Southern schools on his
way up here.
