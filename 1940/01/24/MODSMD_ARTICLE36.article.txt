# Anderson III With Flu; Cagers Prep For U.S.C.
## ken Davidson Guards Ralph In Crucial Two-Game S.G. Series; Dean Works on Fast-Break Defense 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
iJy.il mu> was the oniy tiling of outstanding import to come out of
Stanford's training tamp yesterday, where Coach Everett Dean's cagers
are getting set for the Tiujans this week-end.
Fordy Anderson, who fouled himself out of the Cal game in ainiost
record time after scoring seven points, was put to Led with a slight case

of flu. Stanford will need Anderson<
Friday and Saturday nights in Los
Angsles, because with Dun Williems
and Ken Davidson he forms part of
ihe scoring backbone of the club.
CLEVER FLOOR MAN
Observers readily admit that An
derson is one of the cleverest ball
handlers on the court today. Al
though he has failed to demonstrate
in actual figures the same kind of
scoring that he showed on Eastern
courts, he nevertheless showed
flashes of his ability in the first
U.C.L.A. game. On offense he is
unusually clever in his passing, wit
ness his work in feeding set shots to
Don Williams when the latter tanked
22 points against the Bruins the first
night.
Defensively he is hard to get
around and he has proved by his
ball stealing that it is dangerous for
enemy guards to handle the ball
sloppily while preparing to put it
into play.
Dean's pressing man-to-man de
fense, which so disorganized the
Bears last week, is again expected
to be a strong suit against Troy's
offense. The varsity has already had
a good look at last year's pictures of
the Indian-Trojan games, and Mon
day and yesterday Dean went to
work mapping out strategy to stop
Vaughn and Sears.
TROJAN PLAYS FAST
Stanford expects U.S.C. to put its
ace guard, Tom McGarvin, on Wil
liams. U.S.C. probably already has
guessed that Davidson will trail
Vaughn. Even Bill Cowden will get
some instructions on guarding
Vaughn.
The Trojan offense against which
Dean is working is one which uses
the fast break and short passes,
playing usually to the pivot man—
in this case Sears. A forward, who
would be Vaughn, passes to the
other forward, Morrison or Lambert,
and attempts to cut to the foul mark
where a block is set. That's what
the Indians' man-to-man defense
must break up.


FORDY' ANDERSON, Stanford
basketball forward, is suffering
from a slight touch of the flu. but
will be ready for the all-important
series with U.S.C. this week-end.

ball-handlers ever seen 011 the

CLEVER FLOOR MAN
Observers readily admit that An
derson is one of the cleverest ball
handlers on the court today. Al
though he has failed to demonstrate
in actual figures the same kind of
scoring that he showed on Eastern
courts, he nevertheless showed
flashes of his ability in the first
U.C.L.A. game. On offense he is
unusually clever in his passing, wit
ness his work in feeding set shots to
Don Williams when the latter tanked
22 points against the Bruins the first
night.
Defensively he is hard to get
around and he has proved by his
ball stealing that it is dangerous for
enemy guards to handle the ball
sloppily while preparing to put it
into play.
Dean's pressing man-to-man de
fense, which so disorganized the
Bears last week, is again expected
to be a strong suit against Troy's
offense. The varsity has already had
a good look at last year's pictures of
the Indian-Trojan games, and Mon
day and yesterday Dean went to
work mapping out strategy to stop
Vaughn and Sears.
TROJAN PLAYS FAST
Stanford expects U.S.C. to put its
ace guard, Tom McGarvin, on Wil
liams. U.S.C. probably already has
guessed that Davidson will trail
Vaughn. Even Bill Cowden will get
some instructions on guarding
Vaughn.
The Trojan offense against which
Dean is working is one which uses
the fast break and short passes,
playing usually to the pivot man—
in this case Sears. A forward, who
would be Vaughn, passes to the
other forward, Morrison or Lambert,
and attempts to cut to the foul mark
where a block is set. That's what
the Indians' man-to-man defense
must break up.


FORDY' ANDERSON, Stanford
basketball forward, is suffering

Fordy Anderson, who fouled himself out of the Cal game in ainiost
record time after scoring seven points, was put to Led with a slight case

of flu. Stanford will need Anderson<
Friday and Saturday nights in Los
