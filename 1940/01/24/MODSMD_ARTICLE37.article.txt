i shauser will remind his frosh track
sters that they, have a meet with
San Mateo J. C. coming up next

start bearing down during the com
ing weeks. The meeting will be held

j The squad is not at full strength
yet because several men are out for
| basketball; but things are shaping

j jump, turning in the best perform
ances of any of the freshmen so far
in any event.

and a couple of good shot-put
j heaves by Stan Andersen, one of
I the puts getting out just a shade
under the 52-foot mark. More time
