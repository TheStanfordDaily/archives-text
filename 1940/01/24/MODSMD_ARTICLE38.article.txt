### 
Harry Wolter, director of intra-
I mural sports, sent out a call yester
• day for candidates to succeed Andy
• Stojkovich as intramural sports man
! agev when "Stoke" vacates the post
: at the end of the year.
Those interested in taking over the
[ job will be taught the duties and
responsibilities so that one of them
can step into the post next fall.
The managership is open prefer
j ably to sophomores, as the job usu-
I ally lasts for two years, but any un
l dergraduate can try out for the job.
Some of the duties of the intra
j mural manager are drawing up
I schedules, hiring referees, buying
I trophies, and keeping statistical rec
j ords. Stojkovich said that, although
! the work is hard, the experience
j gained made up for it, and recom
-1 mends the job to anyone interested
I in physical education.
