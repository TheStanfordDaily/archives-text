W-KTO smoking on the Quad'' is a tradition
IN that Stanford wants to keep —as a tra
dition.
This fact was established clearly and con
clusively last night when Ex Committee ac
cepted the report of its sub-committee appointed
to investigate the problem. Informal polls of
living groups determined campus sentiment,
and added the conditions that the tradition
should not be made a rule, nor should any
attempt be made to enforce it.
This closed the issue—as far as all but one
branch of the University is concerned.
Investigations have revealed that most Quad
smoking is done by students in the Law School.
Cigarette butts and wrappings in their area out
number those on all the rest of the Inner Quad
by a ratio of six to one.
It may be that the law students, many of
them having taken their undergraduate work
at other schools, are ignorant of the tradition.
However, a letter written to their Dean by
Men's Council to remind them of it over a week
ago has produced no visible results.
Perhaps the stronger note recommended by
Ex Committee last night will have more no
ticeable effects.
Or it may be that in order to get a law student
to respect a tradition, you have to make it a
law.
