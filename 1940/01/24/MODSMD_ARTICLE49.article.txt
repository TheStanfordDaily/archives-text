# War of Words
## 
### 
IN between valorous attempts to establish the
fact that the A.S.U. is unequivocally open
minded and leans neither to the right nor left,
a letter in today's Campus Opinion chances
upon an important point which a great many
students undoubtedly have overlooked.
Alfred Duff Cooper of Britain and Eve Curie
of France are the two speakers scheduled on
the A.S.S.U. Lecture Series this year. Both have
been appointed official propaganda agents by
their respective governments.
Now no sensible person would suggest that
either of these talks be canceled. While Duff
Cooper is going to talk about the war, Mile.
Curie has announced the relatively neutral
topic, "The Magic of Radium." Even if she
should decide to make references to the war,
strongly partisan ones, there can be no harm in
themâ€”as long as Stanford remembers who is
doing the talking.
The danger in the Lecture Series lies in the
fact that members of the audience may forget
that they are listening to speakers with axes to
grind. They may push their way out of Memo
rial Hall muttering, "Those dirty Germans . . .
Those lousy Russians . . . Those poor Finns."
It was words like these, reactions to potent
Allied propaganda, that made the United States
ready and willing to enter the last World War
when that momentous April day in 1917 arrived.
While a war is raging in Europe, with London
and Paris anxious to drag us into it, we must
keep our eyes open for indoctrination of this
kind, whether it be expressed openly from the
lecture platform or more subtly through other
channels.
If France and Britain (or Germany and Rus
sia, for that matter) by hypodermic injections of
propaganda can succeed in convincing the
United States that their cause is worth fighting
for, all they will have to do is make sure an
other Lusitania is sunk.
And we will be in the war.
