# But Don't Go Near the Water
## 
### 
EX COMMITTEE has really been thrashing in
and out among the inconsequentials the
last week or two. The high point, the absolute
high point, in their official discussion has been
last night's report about the lake.
Here Ex Committee members go to their
meetings at night, bundled within an inch of
their oxygen supplies, wearing hats and rain
coats for fear it may rain, and spend the evening
crying hub-a hub-a-hub a, when are we going
to open Lagunita?
Then last night they heard the Student Man
ager's profound decision that they wouldn't
open it for a while yet.
This conclusion might have developed from
someone's realizing that we haven't had our

annual February rains yet. But if this was the
reason, no indication of it was given.
While admitting that it was really a little cold
to be swimming in the lake, the Student Man
ager spent most of his time mulling around
about some boats.
We can't open the lake, he said, until we get
the right kind of boats.
Oh, yes, he did mention something about not
opening the lake until there were two warm
days so that the life-guards could clear the de
bris from the water.
Yes, let us above all have at least two warm
days before we open the lake.
But let's hope that these two days come after,
not before, February. It would be a pity if a
cloudburst sank those two new boats while Ex
Committee was out on the lake sunning itself.â€”
