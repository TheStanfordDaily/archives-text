SCIENTIFIC BALLOTS
IN MOST democracies people vote for one candidate
to fill one position. This seems to be a rather
straightforward, simple procedure to most observers.
If you want Mr. Lemon to be president, you vote for
Mr. Lemon.
But this system is much too simple for us. At Stan
ford we use a good complicated, preferential balloting
system that has it all over the simple, crude method —
theoretically. Instead of voting for just one man,
like Lemon, you indicate the order in which you favor
all the candidates. You give Mr. Lemon a first place,
Mr. Prune a second place, and Miss Poach a third
place.
Naive theorists assume that by voting for first, sec
ond, and third choices the voter has indicated that he
would like to see Mr. Lemon elected best of all, that
he thinks Mr. Prune is the next best man, and that
he thinks Miss Peach is the worst of the candidates.
What it usually means, however, is this: I want Lemon
for president, and I think that Miss Peach is the sec
ond strongest candidate. So I give Lemon a first and
Miss Peach a last place. Again Miss Peach has been
penalized. And the result is that a Prune and a Lemon
have the best chances of winning, while a Peach is
thrown out.
This happens in a surprisingly large number of
cases.

IN BRIEF, the preferential ballot gives voters the best
possible chance to stab candidates who look like
good men. Now this business of candidate-stabbing
may be a fine thing—as practice for the great, cruel
world that awaits us college-sheltered lambs. If that
is true, if student government should encourage slightly
soiled politics, then let us by all means keep the pref
erential ballot.
But if we pretend to give ourselves constructive
training in democracy, why don't we start by junking
that complex phony, the preferential ballot? There
will be a general student-body election coming up in
about three weeks. It could be one of the most useful
elections in recent years, if we passed an amendment
adopting the more democratic direct primary.
Prunes and Lemons usually get crated away any
how. But let's not give them the inside track.

SCIENTIFIC BALLOTS
IN MOST democracies people vote for one candidate
to fill one position. This seems to be a rather
straightforward, simple procedure to most observers.
If you want Mr. Lemon to be president, you vote for
Mr. Lemon.
But this system is much too simple for us. At Stan
ford we use a good complicated, preferential balloting
system that has it all over the simple, crude method —
theoretically. Instead of voting for just one man,
like Lemon, you indicate the order in which you favor
all the candidates. You give Mr. Lemon a first place,
Mr. Prune a second place, and Miss Poach a third
place.
Naive theorists assume that by voting for first, sec
ond, and third choices the voter has indicated that he
would like to see Mr. Lemon elected best of all, that
he thinks Mr. Prune is the next best man, and that
he thinks Miss Peach is the worst of the candidates.
What it usually means, however, is this: I want Lemon
for president, and I think that Miss Peach is the sec
ond strongest candidate. So I give Lemon a first and
Miss Peach a last place. Again Miss Peach has been
penalized. And the result is that a Prune and a Lemon
have the best chances of winning, while a Peach is
thrown out.
This happens in a surprisingly large number of
cases.

IN BRIEF, the preferential ballot gives voters the best
possible chance to stab candidates who look like
good men. Now this business of candidate-stabbing
may be a fine thing—as practice for the great, cruel
world that awaits us college-sheltered lambs. If that
is true, if student government should encourage slightly
soiled politics, then let us by all means keep the pref
erential ballot.
But if we pretend to give ourselves constructive
training in democracy, why don't we start by junking
that complex phony, the preferential ballot? There
will be a general student-body election coming up in
about three weeks. It could be one of the most useful
elections in recent years, if we passed an amendment
adopting the more democratic direct primary.
Prunes and Lemons usually get crated away any
how. But let's not give them the inside track.
