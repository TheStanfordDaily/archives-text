# CAMPUS OPINION
## WITH ONE EYE CLOSED 
### 
TP HE EDITOR, SIR:
Today it is Oliver Wyman of the S.P.U. whose
information about the Stanford A.S.U. needs to be cor
rected. His statement that "the A.S.U. ofTers but a
single avenue for its expression," is entirely inaccu
rate, in view of the fact that up to now all our meet
ings have presented at least two sides of any contro
versial question.
We have only to remind Wyman of our meetings
concerning the youth movement in Germany, Italian
Fascism, and, in spite of all opposition, the Russo-
German pact.
Oliver Wyman, as the head of a student organiza
tion, must realize that the Committee on Public Exer
cises would insist that we present both sides of any
controversial issue, even if, as is not the case, we
were trying to grind our own axe in public. Nor did
the A.S.U. deliberately seek the disproportionate pub
licity it received from The Daily. If Oliver Wyman
wants publicity for his organization, I advise him
simply to disagree with Mr. Lawrence Livingston, Jr.
While we ai'e on the subject of onc-sidedness, I
would like to ask whether the students of Stanford
are aware that on most vital issues they receive only
one point of view here on the campus. Do they know
that two official propagandists of the Allied govern
ments, namely Alfred Duff Cooper and Eve Curie,
have been invited to address them? To the best of my
knowledge, no representative of the opponents has been
asked. Likewise, Harry Bridges has not been given
an opportunity for a rejoinder against George Sokol
sky.
I am very glad that the S.P.U. is impartial enough
to present three viewpoints and intelligent enough to
handle its own publicity.
Sincerely,
Andries Deinum
