# HITCH-HIKER'S LAMENT

r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
I am disgusted, very disgusted, with a great num
ber of our Stanford students who drive to Palo Alto
every day wilh emplv cars. I feel qualified to speak
on this matter because in the past year I have driven
back and forth twice a day, and have never failed to
pick up whoever needed a ride.
Now, with the main road to Palo Alto closed, it is
increasingly difficult for less financially fortunate stu
dents, including myself, to obtain rides.
Standing on the corner of Emerson and University
last night I watched car after car pass me by—and
not by mistake.
Don't get the impression that. I'm railing at Stan
ford's fine spirit because I'm not, but it's pretty rotten
to feel that one has to have as schoolmates some of
these young "aristocrats" who coast lazily by with a
casual glance out. of the windows of their new cars.
They couldn't think of stopping every time they go
to town and back. So much stop-and-go driving
would be a waste of the valuable gas provided by their
respective fathers and, no doubt, a serious drain on
the family budget. . . .
Then, too, there are the coupes which roll by with
two men in them. They seem immune—filled up. It's
so much trouble to slide over, and not vei'y com
fortable driving that mile with three in the front seat.
Besides, that fellow won't get much colder in another
ten minutes. . . .
I recognize that everybody has an inalienable and
incontestable right to do as he wishes with his own
property, but a little charitable thought for the other
fellow wouldn't hurt our daily lives a bit.
Sincerely,
Philip Dirstinc
