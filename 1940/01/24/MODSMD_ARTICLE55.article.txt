# 'Three Waltzes' Is Long On Ruffles, Short on Plot
## 
### 
Gosh, how those French do flutter! Of course it may have been the
photography—or the directing—or just these particular Frenchmen.
"The Three Waltzes" started oIT with a lace-edged announcement that
this is tho reign of Louis Napoleon and Strauss, Sr., is writing dance music.
Louis sits in the background while the Empress starts trouble by demand-

ing to be presented to the Marquise
de Chalancey—trouble because she
foolishly assumes that the young
lady embracing the Marquis is his
wife. Strauss' music must have been
mentioned only as an interesting
historical fact.
LOVE OR BRAID?
At this point a helpful aunt ex
plains to the wholly ineligible balle
rina (the one that was kissing the
Marquis) that if she marries him he
will have to leave the army. So she
nobly sacrifices her love for a couple
of extra strips of gold braid.
A second lace-edged announce
ment jumps the action up thirty
three years. History repeats itseli
in the second generation. Only thii
time he jilts her because she won't
abandon her career, wear a lot more
clothes, and live in the country.
The third generation of Marquises
and actresses meet in Hollywood
She is a temperamental foreign stai
and he is an insurance salesman,
They break precedent and ignore
family name and stage career to gel
married.
YARDS OF ERMINE
The high point of all this is the
French version of a Hollywood di
rector's yell. Ermine is ordered by
the yard. Actresses throw things
The photography is bad, resembles
the newsreel revivals of Mary Pick
ford films.
The star, Yvonne Printemps, has a
lovely voice; but she should have
stopped playing sweet sixteen before
the reign of Louis Napoleon. Pierre
Fresnay turns n a fair piece of act
ing as a Marquis. He at least does
not flutter.
Paris fashions have for a lon,t
time been something to speak of wit!
awe. The costumes for "The Three
Waltzes" were apparently not de
signed in Paris. That is the only
logical conclusion. The formula
seemed to be: when in doubt, add i
ruffle.—Richmond

photography—or the directing—or just these particular Frenchmen.
"The Three Waltzes" started oIT with a lace-edged announcement that
this is tho reign of Louis Napoleon and Strauss, Sr., is writing dance music.
Louis sits in the background while the Empress starts trouble by demand-

ing to be presented to the Marquise
de Chalancey—trouble because she
foolishly assumes that the young
lady embracing the Marquis is his
wife. Strauss' music must have been
mentioned only as an interesting
historical fact.
LOVE OR BRAID?
At this point a helpful aunt ex
plains to the wholly ineligible balle
rina (the one that was kissing the
Marquis) that if she marries him he
will have to leave the army. So she
nobly sacrifices her love for a couple
of extra strips of gold braid.
A second lace-edged announce
ment jumps the action up thirty
three years. History repeats itseli
in the second generation. Only thii
time he jilts her because she won't
abandon her career, wear a lot more
clothes, and live in the country.
The third generation of Marquises
and actresses meet in Hollywood
She is a temperamental foreign stai
and he is an insurance salesman,
They break precedent and ignore
family name and stage career to gel
married.
YARDS OF ERMINE
The high point of all this is the
French version of a Hollywood di
rector's yell. Ermine is ordered by
the yard. Actresses throw things
The photography is bad, resembles
the newsreel revivals of Mary Pick
ford films.
The star, Yvonne Printemps, has a
lovely voice; but she should have
stopped playing sweet sixteen before
the reign of Louis Napoleon. Pierre
Fresnay turns n a fair piece of act
ing as a Marquis. He at least does
not flutter.
Paris fashions have for a lon,t
time been something to speak of wit!
awe. The costumes for "The Three
Waltzes" were apparently not de
signed in Paris. That is the only
logical conclusion. The formula
seemed to be: when in doubt, add i
ruffle.—Richmond
Gosh, how those French do flutter! Of course it may have been the
photography—or the directing—or just these particular Frenchmen.
