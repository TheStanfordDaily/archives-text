### 
RIVERSIDE, Jan. 23 (UP).â€”The
March Field air base reported to
right a two-motored army bombard
ment plane, dragged down by ice
forming on its wings, crashed and
partly burned as it. attempted to
come in on a light beam. Four of
six occupants were reported killed.
The dead were identified as Lieu
tenant Raymond M. Sumi, of Nash
wauk, Minn., the pilot; Lieutenant
Benjamin G. Holloway, Columbus,
0., co-pilot; Sergeant Gerald D.
Wilcox, and Private Leonard E.
Riley.
Two men, Sergeant Cecil Purvis
and Private Frank Carroll, para
chuted to safety.
RADIOED PREDICAMENT
March Field spokesmen said Lieu
tenant Sumi had radioed the pre
dicament of his plane, a huge B-18
bomber type capable of carrying 14
men, as it came over Box Springs
grade late today.
Sumi gave orders for his men to
jump as the ice formed and the
plane lost altitude.
Purvis and Carroll made the leap.
The others apparently were still at
tempting to get into their para
chutes when the big plane struck
the ground and caught fire.
ICE PROVED FATAL
A light beam had been turned on
for the plane but the ice proved too
heavy and the mechanical parts
froze, it was said.
The plane apparently was flying
low because of the added weight.
Two ambulances were sent to re
move the bodies and give emergency
treatment to Purvis and Carx-01l if
necessary.
General Jacob E. Fiekel, com
mandant of the First Wing General
Headquarters Air Force, and Colo
nel Rush Lincoln, March Field com
mandant, were directing the investi
gation.
BODY THROWN 150 FEET
When the big craft struck the
hillside, burying its motor deep into
the ground, the body of one of the
crew members was thrown 150 feet
from the plane. The other bodies
were found near the wreckage, it
was reported.
It had been raining steadily in the
vicinity for several hours, and visi
bility was poor.
) The plane was on a routine train
ing flight from Sacramento to March
Field when it ran into the storm.
38 PLANES DOWNED
Just a few hours earlier, the army's
I attempt at a mass transportation
(light of an entire battalion of troops
from Hamilton Field to March Field
in 38 planes was foiled by the same
storm and they were ordered down
at Bakersfield.
Army men said the planes battled
snow, sleet and rain in an effort to
got over the Tehachapi Mountains.
Only one plane, commanded by
Colonel Carlyle H. Wash and carry
ing 10 soldiers, reached March Field
finally. The other 37 planes were
downed at the Bakersfield airport.
The plane that crashed was not
taking part in the mass maneuver,
but was of the same type bombard
ment plane.
