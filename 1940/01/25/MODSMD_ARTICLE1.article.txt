### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
r pHE Senate banking and currency
committee yesterday paved (he
way to possible non-military loans to
Finland and other Scandinavian
countries when it approved, 17 to 2,
a bill increasing the Export-Import
Bank's revolving fund by $100,000,-
000.
Despite the fact that this seems to
be an overwhelming vote —17 to 2
—the measure still faces plenty of
obstacles. And, even if it hurdles
them there is no guarantee that Fin
land will get a loan. The bill now
goes to the Senate foreign relations
committee. If it wins approval there,
it must pass successively through
the Senate, one or more House com
mittees, and then the House.
* * ate
And, if the Bank's fund is in
creased, loans then would be at
the discretion of Federal Loan Ad
ministrator Jesse Jones, who told
reporters that he'd he governed
"by the circumstances if and
when Finland applies for further
credit." Several days ago Jones
said that any loan to Finland
which would be used for purchase
of military supplies would consti
tute a violation of the Neutrality
Act. He told the Senate that
when he discussed the Bank's po
sition and policies. You can see
that Finland, then, is still a long
way from getting any actual cash
from Uncle Sam.
* >:< *
jyiEANWHILE, in Europe's cock
pit. reports were drifting about
that the Soviet's have made im
portant economic concessions to Ger
many, even involving mineral rights
in northern Russia, in exchange for
a Nazi promise to engage in general
staff consultation in regard to Fin
land and the Balkans.
These reports, published in the
Paris press but lacking actual au
thoritative confirmation, said the
general staff consultations will be
held this month in Moscow to dis
cuss Nazi-Soviet collaboration in the
face of the increased resistance of
the neutrals.
Ilussia was said to have in
formed Germany that it is neces
sary, for reasons of Russian pres
tige, whatever prestige is left, for
the Red Anr.f to conclude its
campaign in Finland before at
tempting any joint or single oper
ations in the Balkans or any other
European sector.
This new agreement, which re
sulted in German troops occupying a
30 to 35-mile wide corridor of Polish
Galicia on Monday, was reported to
have developed from a proposal
which Soviet Premier and Foreign
Commissar Viacheslav M. Molotov
submitted to the German Ambassa
dor in Moscow on Jan. 14.
* * »»«
()NE of the first consequences of
the new accord was that Russia
turned over to Germany control of
the 1080-mile railroad in Galicia
over which Rumanian oil is carried
to Germany and Germany's military
occupation of that strip of the Rus
sian-held portion of Poland. Since
Monday Germany has a new fron
tier with Rumania through the Ga
lician corridor, guarded by Nazi
troops based at Lwow and menacing
both Rumania and Hungary. These
two countries are not, hence, very
pleased with the last few hours'
development.
On the Belgian-Dutch frontier
where Germany is understood to
have 81 divisions or more than
1,250.000 troops massed, there was
still fear that the Nazis might he
gin a inarch. Along the Western
Front fresh troops were reported
to he arriving from training
camps in the German interior.
German troops were occupying
Galicia, which is the "bay window"
of Danubia and the Balkans." The
French regard this as a definite and
strong threat of a possible German
push to the Black Sea.

the new accord was that Russia
turned over to Germany control of
the 1080-mile railroad in Galicia
over which Rumanian oil is carried
to Germany and Germany's military
occupation of that strip of the Rus
sian-held portion of Poland. Since
Monday Germany has a new fron
tier with Rumania through the Ga
lician corridor, guarded by Nazi
troops based at Lwow and menacing
both Rumania and Hungary. These
two countries are not, hence, very
pleased with the last few hours'
development.
On the Belgian-Dutch frontier

have 81 divisions or more than
1,250.000 troops massed, there was

committee yesterday paved (he
way to possible non-military loans to
Finland and other Scandinavian
countries when it approved, 17 to 2,
a bill increasing the Export-Import
Bank's revolving fund by $100,000,-

Despite the fact that this seems to
be an overwhelming vote —17 to 2
—the measure still faces plenty of
obstacles. And, even if it hurdles
them there is no guarantee that Fin
land will get a loan. The bill now
goes to the Senate foreign relations
committee. If it wins approval there,
it must pass successively through
the Senate, one or more House com

creased, loans then would be at
the discretion of Federal Loan Ad
ministrator Jesse Jones, who told
reporters that he'd he governed
"by the circumstances if and

credit." Several days ago Jones
said that any loan to Finland
which would be used for purchase
of military supplies would consti
