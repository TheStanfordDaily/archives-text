# Stanford Junior Spins Yarn Of 'Four Men on an Island'
## 
### BUD AMES 
A secret three-months trip to nowhere.
That was the offer made to William Stewart Markham, Farm junior, by
the United States government in 1936. Markham accepted and in June
found himself left ashore on tiny Howland Island, square on the equator,

1800 miles from Honolulu.
"Nobody was sure who owned the
island. It was half British and half
American, and even the Japanese
wanted it for an air base," Mark
ham explained. "So the U. S. sent
four of us down there to move in
and claim the island. It all had to
be done quickly and secretly. Even
then there were plenty of com
plaints."
HE'S PART HAWAIIAN
At the time, he was attending a
military school in Honolulu. His
skin is dark and his teeth contrast
ingly white for a great deal of Ha
waiian blood flows in his veins.
Above his desk in Sequoia is a pic
ture of Bill Anahu, Santa Clara all-
American, with whom he used to
play football.
"Besides that, they wanted the
island as a place for Amelia Earhart
to land on her round-the-world
flight," Markham continued. "And
thirdly, we were to take weather re
ports every hour of the day, since
the U.S. is planning a possible Clip
per plane route down that way. But
the birds on the island are a worse
hazard to flying than the weather."
On June 18, Markham and four of
his friends were rowed to Howland's
sandy beach with a stock of canned
goods and two sacks of onions to
prevent scurvy. That was the last
contact the quartet had with the
outside world for two and a half
months—not even a ship passed
them since the island is off the
shipping lanes. Once vessels sailed
those waters because the boys found
an old gun from a wooden whaling
boat wrecked on the island.
"As they took us ashore the
Schmeling-Louis fight was about to
begin. We had to wait two and one
half months to hear the results, be
cause we didn't have any radio," he
laughed. "And by the time we came
off the island, the Spanish war had
begun."
NO FIREARMS
The four had no boats since they
were allowed none by the govern
ment. Ocean currents pull from the
island and there was fear of drift
ing to sea. No fire-arms were allow
ed for fear that one of the four
would go mad from the heat and
monotony and shoot somebody.
"We built walks, stone walls, and
a sort of wooden house in our spare
time—anything to keep from going
crazy," Markham chuckled. "Fished,
too, hut we had to watch out for
.sharks and sting-rays. It got aw
fully monotonous. The island was
only a mile and a half long, a half
mile wide, and 20 feet above
water."
Though thousands of miles from
his home, Honolulu, Markham still

| carries on a few Hawaiian habits.
I Sundays he heads for Santa Cruz
| tor a day of surfing. But he doesn't
' think much of the cold water, or of
California's climate.

American, and even the Japanese
wanted it for an air base," Mark
ham explained. "So the U. S. sent
four of us down there to move in
and claim the island. It all had to
be done quickly and secretly. Even
then there were plenty of com
plaints."
HE'S PART HAWAIIAN
At the time, he was attending a
military school in Honolulu. His
skin is dark and his teeth contrast
ingly white for a great deal of Ha
waiian blood flows in his veins.
Above his desk in Sequoia is a pic

American, with whom he used to
play football.
"Besides that, they wanted the
island as a place for Amelia Earhart
to land on her round-the-world
flight," Markham continued. "And
thirdly, we were to take weather re
ports every hour of the day, since
the U.S. is planning a possible Clip
per plane route down that way. But
the birds on the island are a worse
hazard to flying than the weather."
On June 18, Markham and four of
his friends were rowed to Howland's
sandy beach with a stock of canned
goods and two sacks of onions to
prevent scurvy. That was the last
contact the quartet had with the
outside world for two and a half
months—not even a ship passed
them since the island is off the
shipping lanes. Once vessels sailed
those waters because the boys found
an old gun from a wooden whaling
boat wrecked on the island.
"As they took us ashore the
Schmeling-Louis fight was about to
begin. We had to wait two and one
half months to hear the results, be
cause we didn't have any radio," he
laughed. "And by the time we came
off the island, the Spanish war had
begun."
NO FIREARMS
The four had no boats since they
were allowed none by the govern
ment. Ocean currents pull from the
island and there was fear of drift
ing to sea. No fire-arms were allow
ed for fear that one of the four
would go mad from the heat and
monotony and shoot somebody.
"We built walks, stone walls, and
a sort of wooden house in our spare
time—anything to keep from going
crazy," Markham chuckled. "Fished,
too, hut we had to watch out for
.sharks and sting-rays. It got aw
fully monotonous. The island was
only a mile and a half long, a half
mile wide, and 20 feet above
water."
Though thousands of miles from
his home, Honolulu, Markham still

A secret three-months trip to nowhere.
That was the offer made to William Stewart Markham, Farm junior, by

found himself left ashore on tiny Howland Island, square on the equator,

1800 miles from Honolulu.
"Nobody was sure who owned the
island. It was half British and half
American, and even the Japanese
wanted it for an air base," Mark
