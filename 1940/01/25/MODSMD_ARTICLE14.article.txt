j ties at the carnival will be made
i and important announcements will
i be given out at the meeting, said
; McDufTie.
Plans for entry in the skiing com
petition have already been made. A
team to represent Stanford in the
j women's slalom which will be held
Saturday afternoon, Feb. 3, has al
ready been chosen. Members of the
j team are Eleanor Watson, Mary
! Cowles, and Anne Searls.
RESERVATIONS DUE
i "Final selection of the men's team
I will be made thus week-end at Yose
i mite," said McDuffie, "so it is very
j important that all aspirants are up
] there." Reservations for rooms
l must be made before noon today at
the A.S.S.U. office.
The carnival is the second spon
i sored by the University of Nevada
, and will be held Feb. 2, 3, and 4 in
I Reno. Last year, over 2000 contest
j ants and spectators attended. Six
j western universities were repre-
I sented.
PROSPECTS GOOD
| Stanford is expected 1o make a
i good showing at the 1940 carnival.
Three men from the club, Bill Janss,
McDuffie, and Phil Clayburgh turn
i ed in excellent performances at the
I Jeffcrs Ski Cup Tourney, held in
I Sun ValLey last week-end.
j Judging from the times turned in
by these three, Stanford should
excel both in the downhill race on
Saturday afternoon and the slalom
on Sunday morning. There will be
a jumping contest on Sunday after
noon and trophies will be presented
immediately after this event.
All events will take place at Mt.
Rose, which is about 20 minutes'
