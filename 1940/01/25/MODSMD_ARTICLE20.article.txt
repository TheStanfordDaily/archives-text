# TRACK COACH NAMED
## Frank 'Pitch' Johnson Recommended by BAC For Five-Year Contract Drake U. Mentor Gets Nomination In Surprise Action; Appointment Awaits Wilbur's Approval, Feb. 15 
### ARCH JENKINS 
lii a .surprise move that caught the press and the general public entirely
unaware, Stanford's Board of Athletic Control last night unanimously
nominated.Franklin Pitcher (Pitch) Johnson, present coach at Drake Uni
versity, as the Farm's director of track and field.
The nomination, proposed for five years beginning with the 1941 season,
is to he considered by President Ray Lyman Wilbur at the next regular

meeting of the Board of Trustees on
Tuesday, Feb. 15.
Johnson, long famous as the di
rector of the annual Drake Relays
and as president of the National Col
lege Track Coaches' Association, suc
ceeds R. L. "Dink" Templeton and
the acting director, Bill Ellington.
Ellington, however, will continue to
coach the squad through the present
season and seems likely to retain
the same assistantship under John
son that, he formerly held under
Templeton.
MADE TWO VISITS
The new director made two visits
to the campus during the past
month, meeting members of the
Board and other interested local
officials on both occasions. His se
lection last night was an almost
about-face from the long, ill-publi
cized campaign that followed the
course of selection of a new football
mentor through the fall and winter
months.
"We feel," said a member of the
B.A.C. after the selection, "that the
election of a new coach now will
preclude any possibility of verbal
battles in the local press and be
tween various alumni factions. The
bad publicity of that long campaign
has been avoided by the early se
lection of a truly superior coach."
Johnson will retain his mid-west
varsity post at the Dos Moines,
lowa, institution until the end of
the summer campaign. His first, offi
cial duties on the Stanford campus
will probably begin with fall track
workouts and cross-country imme
diately after the opening of the com
ing autumn quarter.
A native of St. Louis, Missouri,
Johnson will bring an enviable rec
ord as a competitor and coach to
the local picture. Hi.s selection, in
cidentally, marks the third time in
as many years that the Board of
Athletic Control has dug into the
cream of the mid-western crop for
a major sports coach. Only Base
ball Coach Harry Wolter and Ten
nis Coach Sherman Lockwood re
