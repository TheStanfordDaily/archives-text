# TRACK COACH NAMED
## Frank 'Pitch' Johnson Recommended by BAC For Five-Year Contract Drake U. Mentor Gets Nomination In Surprise Action; Appointment Awaits Wilbur's Approval, Feb. 15 
### ARCH JENKINS 
lii a .surprise move that caught the press and the general public entirely
unaware, Stanford's Board of Athletic Control last night unanimously
nominated.Franklin Pitcher (Pitch) Johnson, present coach at Drake Uni
versity, as the Farm's director of track and field.
The nomination, proposed for five years beginning with the 1941 season,
is to he considered by President Ray Lyman Wilbur at the next regular

meeting of the Board of Trustees on
Tuesday, Feb. 15.
Johnson, long famous as the di
rector of the annual Drake Relays
and as president of the National Col
lege Track Coaches' Association, suc
ceeds R. L. "Dink" Templeton and
the acting director, Bill Ellington.
Ellington, however, will continue to
coach the squad through the present
season and seems likely to retain
the same assistantship under John
son that, he formerly held under
Templeton.
MADE TWO VISITS
The new director made two visits
to the campus during the past
month, meeting members of the
Board and other interested local
officials on both occasions. His se
lection last night was an almost
about-face from the long, ill-publi
cized campaign that followed the
course of selection of a new football
mentor through the fall and winter
months.
"We feel," said a member of the
B.A.C. after the selection, "that the
election of a new coach now will
preclude any possibility of verbal
battles in the local press and be
tween various alumni factions. The
bad publicity of that long campaign
has been avoided by the early se
lection of a truly superior coach."
Johnson will retain his mid-west
varsity post at the Dos Moines,
lowa, institution until the end of
the summer campaign. His first, offi
cial duties on the Stanford campus
will probably begin with fall track
workouts and cross-country imme
diately after the opening of the com
ing autumn quarter.
A native of St. Louis, Missouri,
Johnson will bring an enviable rec
ord as a competitor and coach to
the local picture. Hi.s selection, in
cidentally, marks the third time in
as many years that the Board of
Athletic Control has dug into the
cream of the mid-western crop for
a major sports coach. Only Base
ball Coach Harry Wolter and Ten
nis Coach Sherman Lockwood re
main <>f (he old quintet.
WENT TO ILLINOIS
Johnson first became a track
prominent as an undergraduate at.
Illinois from 1922 through 1924. He
was a high and low hurdler and
broad jumper and captained his
team in 1924. He tied the world' 1 ,
record for the 110-meter hurdles in
the '24 Olympics at, Boston with a
mark of 14 .8 seconds, later reaching
the semi-finals of the Olympics in
Paris.
Soon after graduation, Johnson
became an assistant to Harry Gill at
I his alma mater. He retained this
post through the 1927 season and
! then moved to Drake as head coach.
His teams won the Missouri Valley
I titles in 1931, 1933, 1935, and 1936,
| placed second four times, won third
twice, and went as low as fourth
only once.
In the conference's indoor cham-
I pionships, his Drake squads have
won six firsts, two seconds, and one
! third, with no meets being held in
1932 and 1933.
Johnson has been especially suc
! cessful in cross-country, one of
i Stanford's most dismal sports. In
| 10 years, his teams have won 25
dual grinds while dropping but
( seven. In three years of the Nation
lal Collegiate Cross-Country cham
j pionships in 1937-38-39, Drake has
j finished second, third, and fourth,
respectively.
IS AN EXECUTIVE
The new mentor has likewise
been especially successful as an ex
ecutive in most of the coaching and
rules organizations. Since 1933, he
has been either president or secre
tary-treasurer of the N.C.T.C.A. and
jhe has served several terms as a
! member of the track and field com
| mittee of the Amateur Athletic
Union. He was just re-elected to a
four-year term on the rules com
mittee of the N.C.A.A.
Johnson is 39 years old, married,
and has one 11 and one 7-year-old
son. He is an excellent badminton
and squash player but likes to brag
more about his golf game, which
usually stays well in the 80's.
Less than half of the Orkney Is
lands off the Scottish coast are in
habited.

I titles in 1931, 1933, 1935, and 1936,

In the conference's indoor cham-
I pionships, his Drake squads have
won six firsts, two seconds, and one
! third, with no meets being held in

Johnson has been especially suc

( seven. In three years of the Nation
lal Collegiate Cross-Country cham
j pionships in 1937-38-39, Drake has
j finished second, third, and fourth,
respectively.
IS AN EXECUTIVE
The new mentor has likewise
been especially successful as an ex
ecutive in most of the coaching and
rules organizations. Since 1933, he
has been either president or secre
tary-treasurer of the N.C.T.C.A. and
jhe has served several terms as a
! member of the track and field com
| mittee of the Amateur Athletic
Union. He was just re-elected to a
four-year term on the rules com
mittee of the N.C.A.A.
Johnson is 39 years old, married,
and has one 11 and one 7-year-old
son. He is an excellent badminton
and squash player but likes to brag
more about his golf game, which
usually stays well in the 80's.
Less than half of the Orkney Is

lii a .surprise move that caught the press and the general public entirely
unaware, Stanford's Board of Athletic Control last night unanimously
nominated.Franklin Pitcher (Pitch) Johnson, present coach at Drake Uni
versity, as the Farm's director of track and field.
The nomination, proposed for five years beginning with the 1941 season,
is to he considered by President Ray Lyman Wilbur at the next regular

meeting of the Board of Trustees on
Tuesday, Feb. 15.
Johnson, long famous as the di
rector of the annual Drake Relays
and as president of the National Col
lege Track Coaches' Association, suc
ceeds R. L. "Dink" Templeton and
the acting director, Bill Ellington.
Ellington, however, will continue to
coach the squad through the present
season and seems likely to retain
the same assistantship under John
son that, he formerly held under
Templeton.
MADE TWO VISITS
The new director made two visits
to the campus during the past
month, meeting members of the
Board and other interested local
officials on both occasions. His se
lection last night was an almost
about-face from the long, ill-publi
cized campaign that followed the
course of selection of a new football
mentor through the fall and winter
months.
"We feel," said a member of the
B.A.C. after the selection, "that the
election of a new coach now will
preclude any possibility of verbal
battles in the local press and be
tween various alumni factions. The
bad publicity of that long campaign
has been avoided by the early se
lection of a truly superior coach."
Johnson will retain his mid-west
varsity post at the Dos Moines,
lowa, institution until the end of
the summer campaign. His first, offi
cial duties on the Stanford campus
will probably begin with fall track
workouts and cross-country imme
diately after the opening of the com
ing autumn quarter.
A native of St. Louis, Missouri,
Johnson will bring an enviable rec
ord as a competitor and coach to
the local picture. Hi.s selection, in
cidentally, marks the third time in
as many years that the Board of
Athletic Control has dug into the
cream of the mid-western crop for
a major sports coach. Only Base
ball Coach Harry Wolter and Ten
nis Coach Sherman Lockwood re
main <>f (he old quintet.
WENT TO ILLINOIS
Johnson first became a track
prominent as an undergraduate at.
Illinois from 1922 through 1924. He
was a high and low hurdler and
broad jumper and captained his
team in 1924. He tied the world' 1 ,
record for the 110-meter hurdles in
the '24 Olympics at, Boston with a
mark of 14 .8 seconds, later reaching
the semi-finals of the Olympics in
Paris.

Johnson will retain his mid-west
varsity post at the Dos Moines,

will probably begin with fall track
workouts and cross-country imme

A native of St. Louis, Missouri,
Johnson will bring an enviable rec

WENT TO ILLINOIS
Johnson first became a track
prominent as an undergraduate at.
Illinois from 1922 through 1924. He
was a high and low hurdler and
broad jumper and captained his
team in 1924. He tied the world' 1 ,
record for the 110-meter hurdles in
the '24 Olympics at, Boston with a
mark of 14 .8 seconds, later reaching
the semi-finals of the Olympics in
Paris.
Soon after graduation, Johnson
became an assistant to Harry Gill at
I his alma mater. He retained this
post through the 1927 season and
! then moved to Drake as head coach.
His teams won the Missouri Valley
I titles in 1931, 1933, 1935, and 1936,
| placed second four times, won third
twice, and went as low as fourth
only once.
In the conference's indoor cham-
I pionships, his Drake squads have
won six firsts, two seconds, and one
! third, with no meets being held in
1932 and 1933.
Johnson has been especially suc
! cessful in cross-country, one of
i Stanford's most dismal sports. In
| 10 years, his teams have won 25
dual grinds while dropping but
( seven. In three years of the Nation
lal Collegiate Cross-Country cham
j pionships in 1937-38-39, Drake has
j finished second, third, and fourth,
respectively.
IS AN EXECUTIVE
The new mentor has likewise
been especially successful as an ex
ecutive in most of the coaching and
rules organizations. Since 1933, he
has been either president or secre
tary-treasurer of the N.C.T.C.A. and
jhe has served several terms as a
! member of the track and field com
| mittee of the Amateur Athletic
Union. He was just re-elected to a
four-year term on the rules com
mittee of the N.C.A.A.
Johnson is 39 years old, married,
and has one 11 and one 7-year-old
son. He is an excellent badminton
and squash player but likes to brag
more about his golf game, which
usually stays well in the 80's.
Less than half of the Orkney Is
lands off the Scottish coast are in
habited.
lii a .surprise move that caught the press and the general public entirely
unaware, Stanford's Board of Athletic Control last night unanimously
nominated.Franklin Pitcher (Pitch) Johnson, present coach at Drake Uni
versity, as the Farm's director of track and field.
The nomination, proposed for five years beginning with the 1941 season,
is to he considered by President Ray Lyman Wilbur at the next regular

meeting of the Board of Trustees on
Tuesday, Feb. 15.
Johnson, long famous as the di
rector of the annual Drake Relays
and as president of the National Col
lege Track Coaches' Association, suc
ceeds R. L. "Dink" Templeton and
the acting director, Bill Ellington.
Ellington, however, will continue to
coach the squad through the present
season and seems likely to retain
the same assistantship under John
son that, he formerly held under
Templeton.
MADE TWO VISITS
The new director made two visits
to the campus during the past
month, meeting members of the
Board and other interested local
officials on both occasions. His se
lection last night was an almost
about-face from the long, ill-publi
cized campaign that followed the
course of selection of a new football
mentor through the fall and winter
months.
"We feel," said a member of the
B.A.C. after the selection, "that the
election of a new coach now will
preclude any possibility of verbal
battles in the local press and be
tween various alumni factions. The
bad publicity of that long campaign
has been avoided by the early se
lection of a truly superior coach."
