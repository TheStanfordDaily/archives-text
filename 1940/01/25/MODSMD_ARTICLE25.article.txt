# Buck Speaks On U.S. Role In Neutrality
## Lunch Club Speaker Opposes Cash, Carry Policy of Congress 
### 
America should abandon every
objective except to be the determin
ing' influence in (Jie peace settlement
of the present war, declared Profes
sor Philip W. Buck of the political
science department when he spoke
on "Practical Aspects of Neutrality"
before the Luncheon Club in the
Nitery yesterday noon.
"It might be possible for us to
dodge the war in some way, but it
is impossible for us to dodge the
peace. The world must have con
certed action on that," Dr. Buck
said.
CONDEMNS NEW POLICY
Professor Buck condemned the
cash-and-carry policy on the
grounds that sooner or later the cash
of the rest of the world will run
out and the United States will be
forced by economic interests in the
country to extend credit. "Credit
helped to put America in for the
last war," he said.
"The cash-and-carry policy does
not make us neutral," Dr. Buck de
clared. He pointed out that the
practice of this policy puts us on
the side of the Allies because they
are the only belligerents who can
afford trade on such a basis.
ISOLATION SCORED
Besides, he said, the cash-aid-carry
policy is not bringing the United
States the expected economic re
turns because Europe is conserving
her cash in order to stretch it out as
long as possible.
The result of extreme isolation
ism, Professor Buck stated, would be
to land us in the midst of another
depression. From 40 to 50 per cent
o# our trade is carried on with
Europe, he said, and isolation would
involve a complete upset of our
economic system.
