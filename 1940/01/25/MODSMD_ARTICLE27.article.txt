# Lewis Sees Defeat If F.R. Runs Again
## 
### 
COLUMBUS. 0., Jan. 24 (UP).â€”
John L. Lewis today denounced
President Roosevelt and the Demo
cratic party for failure to solve
major national problems and pre
dicted "ignominious defeat" if Mr.
Roosevelt is nominated for a third
term.
Lewis, president of the United
Mine Workers of America and of
the Congress of Industrial Organi
zations, apparently ended a seven
year close association with the New
Deal in a bitter, sharply worded
statement to the mine union's jubi
lee convention.
