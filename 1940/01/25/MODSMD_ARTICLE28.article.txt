# Smiths Surge Ahead to Lead Bawlout Race
## Johnson National Rating Inapplicable On Farm; 20 Listed 
### VIC MINAHAN 
The fable of the guy who went '
visiting a person named Bob Smith \
in New York and didn't bother to J
take his address because he could :
"just look him up in the telephone j
book" could be applied to Stanford :
just as well as Gotham.
There are G4 Smiths in the winter
quarter bawlout, of whom five are
Roberts, three Charles, and two 1
Harolds. There are also two Willies,
though they try to fool you by listing
one under "Bill" and the other under
"William."
According to national surveys, the
Johnsons have been creeping up on
the mighty Smiths in the last decade,
but on the Farm they are not only
'way behind in that race, but are
tied by the lowly Jones at 20 each.
There seems to be a controversy
ever whether the Johnstons and
Johnsens should be included (in
cluding them would give the Stan
ford Johnsons 27). The Johnsons
demand a euphonious listing, while
the Joneses say that orthography is
the thing. Maybe thoy ought to ask
the Johnstons what they think about
it, or, in a dire emergency, forget
about the whole thing.
