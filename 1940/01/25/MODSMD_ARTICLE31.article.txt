# 'Fordy' Contracts Flu, Card Cage Stock Falls
## Leon LaFaille, Penn Replace Star Forward 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
If Stanford's basketball team is
going to be a come-through team
this year, it'll have to start right in
this week-end against the Terrible
Trojans in Los Angeles.
Although he may make the trip,
Fordy Anderson's value to the team
come tomorrow and Saturday nights
is going to be nil. Anderson went to
the hospital yesterday with a 102
temperature.
Burden of taking his place at for
ward will fall on Leon Lafaille and
Bob Penn. However, Coach Everett
Dean expects both men to come
through for the Indians as they have
been playing very satisfactory ball
in the past few games.
OK EH AGAINST PACIFIC
Against the College of the Pacific,
both Lafaille and Penn were good
for 15 points each, tying for high
scoring honors. Although Stan
ford's chances for upsetting the Tro
jans aren't going to be so great,
nevertheless the quintet may click
as well as it did against the Bears
when Anderson went out on per
sonal fouls.
Twelve men will probably make
the trip south. The team shoves off
via Southern Pacific this evening.
The probable traveling team will be:
Williams, Lafaille, Denton, Wells,
Anderson, Taylor, Perm, Davidson,
Cowden, Rahn, Alltucker, and
Wensel.
LIGHT WORKOUTS
Workouts this week have been
strictly light, working out defenses
and offenses tor the high-scoring
Trojans. Their defense has been de
signed to halt both Ralph Vaughn
and Dale Sears, the conference's
No. 1 and No. 4 best scorers.
However, the Indians aren't for
getting the scoring threats at the
other forward, Lambert and Mor
rison, and Guards Lippert and Mc-
Garvin. Neither team is knee deep
in reserves. Stanford will count on
its regular starting five with at the
most three substitutions, while Sam
Barry will have to follow the same
plan.

ford's chances for upsetting the Tro
jans aren't going to be so great,
nevertheless the quintet may click
as well as it did against the Bears
when Anderson went out on per
sonal fouls.
Twelve men will probably make
the trip south. The team shoves off
via Southern Pacific this evening.
The probable traveling team will be:
Williams, Lafaille, Denton, Wells,
Anderson, Taylor, Perm, Davidson,
Cowden, Rahn, Alltucker, and
Wensel.
LIGHT WORKOUTS
Workouts this week have been
strictly light, working out defenses
and offenses tor the high-scoring
Trojans. Their defense has been de
signed to halt both Ralph Vaughn
and Dale Sears, the conference's
No. 1 and No. 4 best scorers.
However, the Indians aren't for
getting the scoring threats at the
other forward, Lambert and Mor
rison, and Guards Lippert and Mc-
Garvin. Neither team is knee deep
in reserves. Stanford will count on
its regular starting five with at the
most three substitutions, while Sam
Barry will have to follow the same
plan.
