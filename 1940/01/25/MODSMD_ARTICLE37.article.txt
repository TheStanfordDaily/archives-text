hut Slants has decided to let
J Frank Guthrie, assistant sports

lington ahead of time.)

THE MAN WHO HEADS
OUR TRACK DESTINIES
Back in 1930 when Dink Temple
ton had to foresake track coaching
temporarily, they picked out W. B.
(Bill) Ellington to take charge of
the Indian squad. Bill was nominally
head coach for three seasons, 1930,
1931, and 1932, but as long as Dink
was actually still track and field
coach on the Farm very few sports
writers mentioned that Bill was
really responsible i'or the squads.
Bill told me yesterday that once
when someone asked Dink who this
Bill Ellington was, Dink was at a
loss. All he knew was that Bill had
been appointed his assistant in the
spring of 1927 —he didn't even know
if Bill had ever been interested or
closely associated with track and
field prior to that time.
"So," Bill told me, "I dragged out
a picture I had taken when cap
tain of my high school team in
Sutter, showing me with knee
length shorts. I told him that the
next time anyone asked ahout me
that here was proof that I once
was a trackman. And you can tell
them that I was a of a half
miler."
ELLINGTON? HE VAULTED
AND RAN THE HALF-MILE
In high school Bill ran the half in
2:01 and was vaulting around 10 feet
6 inches when the world's record
was only 11-8. After graduating in
1901 he went to Vandernalin's En
gineering School in San Francisco
and became a civil engineer. While
a Sutter County surveyor, he spent
all of his spare time teaching track,
basketball, and baseball at the high
school, his first attempts at coaching.
"There have been such tremen
dous changes in the coaching in
the past 15 years. It has become
more scientific and it has been the
adaptation of this scientific coach
ing which has so changed times
and distances in track."
Bill gives a lot of credit to Dink
for what he knows. However, he
differs from Dink in the way to
train his athletes.
"I may be wrong but I believe
that a trackman should be interested
enough to want to work hard rather
than have to be forced as was Dink's
method," Bill said
MORE POWER. BILL
—THE TRACKMEN
Being on Bill's team, I think that
he has the right idea. There's not a
fellow who isn't for him and who
won't work hard to make his first
year as actual head coach a success.
Fortunately for Stanford the dis
tance men and sprinters are knee
deep and there's going to be a lot
of spirit when it comes to making
the team which goes north spring
vacation.
