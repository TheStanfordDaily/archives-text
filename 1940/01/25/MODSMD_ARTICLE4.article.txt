# Satiric Drama To Open Soon
## Playwright Razzes Legendary Heroes 
### 
The play, which one critic has
termed the "finest bit of historical
kidding that has appeared on our
stage," will take the stage of Me
morial Hall at 8:15 o'clock, just one
week from tonight.
The play is "The Warrior's Hus
band," and its author is Julian
Thompson. In the play, Thompson
j fries to a nice golden brown most of
| the ancient legends about Hcrcules,
Homer, Ajax, Achilles, and the
famous girdle Diana wore around
her waist, and which was handed
down and down till it reached the
Queen of the Amazons.
GIRDLE ALL-IMPORTANT
To lose this girdle was to lose
the Amazonian prowess in battle.
And then the gods commanded that
Hercules go forth on his ninth la
borâ€”to gain the girdle of Hippolyta,
j Queen of the Amazons.
Into this wish-country of Women-
Who-Are-Forceful and Men-Who-
Are-Mere-Mush comes a Greek
army, led ostensibly by Hercules
but really by Theseus, who is the
brains of the expedition. They have
stopped off to pick up the girdle on
! their way to Troy, where a Trojan
| named Paris has taken Helen, "wife
I of a friend of theirs."
HOMER DOES PUBLICITY
| Homer is the expedition's press
I agent. He's doing a serial on Her
cules' adventures. Hercules is a
nervous giant who, "just because he
strangled a python in his cradle,
has had to live up to that reputation
ever since."
Thompson takes his greatest glee
j in left-handed swats at our present
j day social structure. His portrayal
of the land of the Amazons with Its
fierce, two-fisted women and gen
tle, delicate little men is a saw
toothed satire on modern feminine
and masculine social conventions.
