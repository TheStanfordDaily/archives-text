# Why a New Coach?
## 
### 
LAST night, just as the closing bell rang in the
Library, the Board of Athletic Control was
nominating a new track coach for Stanford.
Its recommendation now has only to be ap
proved by President Wilbur and the Board of
Trustees to take effect.
A large number of students probably are
surprised at this move. Possibly some are
wondering, "Why pick a man at this early date,
before the season has even started?" Others
may be asking, "Why not give Acting Coach
Bill Ellington a chance to prove himself this
season, and if he is successful, give him the
job?"
There are sound answers to both these ques
tions.
First, as long as the problem of who is to
be head coach remains unsettled, Stanford
leaves itself open to the same headaches in
track that it suffered in football from the open
ing of last season up to the time that Shaugh
nessy's appointment was confirmed.
An empty post gives the alumni a chance to
split up into factions and squabble over who
is to get the job. It gives those who are rabid
enough on the subject an opportunity to disrupt
the team by attempting to influence the mem
bers, to whom they are giving scholarships, as
to who their next headman should be.
Even the trackmen themselves could not help
but wonder what is going to happen next year.
Student body sentiment probably would be split
almost as many ways as that of the alumni,
although it is doubtful that as much name
calling would result.
With the track coach a question-mark, the
City sports writers could once again start grind
ing out their reams of prognosticating copy,
running Stanford through the mill—just as they
did before the football mentor was named.
All these evils were avoided by selecting a
new coach last night.
But there is still the second question: Why
not give Bill Ellington a chance?
The answer is that he already has had one.
In 1930, '31, and '32 he was acting head coach
during the illness of Dink Templeton, and in
all of these years he met with extraordinary
success.
The members of the B.A.C. knew that when
they accepted Templeton's resignation, they
knew it when they recommended Tex Byrd,
they knew it when Byrd turned down the job—
when they made Ellington acting coach for the
year. If the Board were going to give old Bill
the job, they certainly would have done it then.
He already had proved himself, and still they
did not consider that he was quite the right man
for the head coach position. Any success he
might make this coming season would not
change their minds.
It should be obvious from the appointment
of Shaughnessy that the Stanford Board of Ath
letic Control does not base its recommendations
on the number of games a man has won and
lost.
Moreover, there is a third reason, more im
portant than either of the two previously cited,
why "Pitch" Johnson received the unanimous
recommendation of the Board last night.
He is the outstanding young track, field, and
cross-country coach in the nation, available to
take over the post at Stanford. Possessing a
remarkably fine record in his own conference,
he has made a name for himself throughout the
country as director of the Drake Relays.
Johnson is interested in more than track. He
is interested in men.
And so when next fall rolls around, we will
have one new coach on the gridiron and an
other on the track. Stanford will be equipped
with the man-power necessary to pull it out of
its athletic doldrums—and put it back on top,
v/here it belongs.
