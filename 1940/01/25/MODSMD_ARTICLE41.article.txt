ABOUT 50 Stanford students are being |
trained by the federal government to oper
ate military airplanes, although the course of
instruction is given under the label "Civilian."
At least that it what the Committee on Mili
tarism in Education purports to have discovered
about the Civil Aeronautics Authority plan to
train 10,000 citizen pilots yearly—and Stanford
is included in that plan.
This militaristic aspect of the training pro
gram is hardly news. At the time the plan went
into effect last year, it was generally concluded
that the government wasn't handing out free
flight training for nothing. Happy Sunday after
noons in the air were not what Uncle Sam had
in mind.
But the Committee seems to think the matter
important, and has gone to considerable pains
to substantiate ils claim with quotations from j

testimony at a Senate hearing on national de
fense.
It is apparent that American universities are
being used as the training ground for a genera
tion of pursuit pilots. The army has said that
the plan will provide a vast, valuable reserve,
which can be pressed into military service with
a minimum of time and effort. America's youth,
they say, will be "air conscious."
And inevitably America's youth will also be
"war conscious." It will be a part of the drive
for re-armament, and it cannot help but be
affected by the fever.
The argument for the training of pilots is
based on the assumption that we do need a
vaster air force. If we must build planes, then
we must teach men to use them effectively.
But the question of whether we do need more
planes, or a bigger navy or army, has not been
satisfactorily answered. Navy men boast of
the prowess of our fleet, and then turn around
and urge that we build still more. Army men
are agreed that our anti-aircraft defenses are
inadequate.
The one fact that makes sense in this mess is
simply that the United States is 3,000 miles dis
tant from Europe, 6,000 from the Orient. An
attack on this country would be a fiasco because
of this barrier of ocean.
Meanwhile, each year 10,000 pilots will be
trained. Congress will pass huge "defense"
appropriations. We will build an immense army
and navy, with dreadnaughts and sleek de
stroyers and table-top aircraft carriers.
And when we have the tools, whether we
need them or not, it will be tragically easy to
use them.—J. B.

noons in the air were not what Uncle Sam had
in mind.
But the Committee seems to think the matter
important, and has gone to considerable pains
to substantiate ils claim with quotations from j

testimony at a Senate hearing on national de
fense.
It is apparent that American universities are
being used as the training ground for a genera
tion of pursuit pilots. The army has said that
the plan will provide a vast, valuable reserve,
which can be pressed into military service with
a minimum of time and effort. America's youth,
they say, will be "air conscious."
And inevitably America's youth will also be
"war conscious." It will be a part of the drive
for re-armament, and it cannot help but be
affected by the fever.
The argument for the training of pilots is
based on the assumption that we do need a
vaster air force. If we must build planes, then
we must teach men to use them effectively.
But the question of whether we do need more
planes, or a bigger navy or army, has not been
satisfactorily answered. Navy men boast of
the prowess of our fleet, and then turn around
and urge that we build still more. Army men
are agreed that our anti-aircraft defenses are
inadequate.
The one fact that makes sense in this mess is
simply that the United States is 3,000 miles dis
tant from Europe, 6,000 from the Orient. An
attack on this country would be a fiasco because
of this barrier of ocean.
Meanwhile, each year 10,000 pilots will be
trained. Congress will pass huge "defense"
appropriations. We will build an immense army
and navy, with dreadnaughts and sleek de
stroyers and table-top aircraft carriers.
And when we have the tools, whether we
need them or not, it will be tragically easy to
use them.—J. B.
ABOUT 50 Stanford students are being |
trained by the federal government to oper
ate military airplanes, although the course of
instruction is given under the label "Civilian."
At least that it what the Committee on Mili
tarism in Education purports to have discovered
about the Civil Aeronautics Authority plan to
train 10,000 citizen pilots yearly—and Stanford
is included in that plan.
This militaristic aspect of the training pro
gram is hardly news. At the time the plan went
into effect last year, it was generally concluded
that the government wasn't handing out free
flight training for nothing. Happy Sunday after
noons in the air were not what Uncle Sam had
in mind.
