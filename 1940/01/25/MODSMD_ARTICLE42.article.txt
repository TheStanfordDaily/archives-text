### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
AFTER YOU. ADMIRAL
iil'M sorry," said the Japanese foreign office in ap
propriate diplomatic language, "but you really
shouldn't have stopped our battleship. According to
international law you British had no right to take
Nazi sailors off the boat by force."
"We are very regretful that we must disagree with
you," countered the British foreign office, "but we
did have a right to take the Nazi sailors, by virtue
of our position under the rules applying to the high
seas."
And so, in ultra-courteous terms, the nations of
the world reprimand one another for breaking the
"rules" of this delightful little game of war. It's all
highly civilized.
And it's all highly convenient. As long as the
rules don't matter, you observe them. If a nation you
want to "get" breaks the rules, you have a very polite
excuse for attacking her ships. And best of all, if
you feel restricted by the rules, you just resort to
force. It's very simple.
British and German torpedoes are destroying mil
lions of dollars worth of human effort. On one bat
tleship sent to the bottom enough money was spent to
build Stanford University. And quite a few healthy,
mentally alert men —as yet unconvicted of idiocy or
murder —were rather messily blown apart.

IN FACT, it is a little difficult to picture a more
complete descent to barbarism and vandalism than
is involved in naval (or military) warfare. Most people
grant that—in principle. But just because the British
and the Japanese and the Germans arc being savages
is no reason, they feel, to abandon diplomatic cour
tesy and tongue-service to a futile and impotent in
ternational law. And they aren't the only ones. We
did it in 1917.
Now as long as we are all agreed on this somewhat
paradoxical set of customs, why not make the war
game even more formal and orderly. We could just
have the battleships, loaded with men, sail through
regulated lanes shooting one another to bits. Or bet
ter still, the enemy forces could line up on either
side of the International Date Line and take turns
with their guns.
Particularly sporting commanders, the Thomas Lip
tons of the navies, would probably be very gentle
manly about the whole thing.
Winston Churchill might say, "Go ahead, Adolph,
you shoot first."
"Ach no!" Adolph would reply in a well-modulated
bellow. "After you."
And then they would blow each other up.
At the rate we are becoming civilized, that situa
tion may not be too much to hope for.
After you, admiral!
