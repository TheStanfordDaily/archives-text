# CAMPUS OPINION
## MUTTERINGS OF REVOLT 
### 
HPHE EDITOR, SIR:
As a long-suffering Encina freshman I have eaten
uncomplainingly at Encina Commons for more than a
whole quarter. I have eaten meat loaf that was little
more than compressed hash; I have eaten hundreds
of kinds of meat which was so disguised in creams
and dough that it was unrecognizable; I have eaten
tasteless vegetables and all sorts of incredibly doughy
and gooey pastries; but now I have decided to rebel.
I have become convinced that there is a definite reason
why no visitors are permitted at Encina Commons- —
the lousy food.
The first quarter I became accustomed to seeing
meat first a dried out beef, then a compressed hash,
and then as the filling for a sort of meat pie. How
ever, when the food this winter quarter started out at
the end of this unappetizing schedule with compressed
hash, I smelled a rat. I am not a biologist, but I am
rather sure that compressed hash kept two weeks,
whether in refrigerators or not, isn't very good for
one.
* ♦ * *
r DIRECTOR of Encina Commons gave a very
assuring statement to The Daily about the quality
of Encina food after the recent wave of gastrointes
tinal disturbances, but my roommate, who ate at no
fraternity that day and who does not drink became
violently ill near my bed the night after we were fed
tainted hominy, and. I believe, steaks which had
spoiled. I ate only a little bit of these things because
I am, shall we say, more fastidious than my room
mate and I was only slightly uncomfortable.
The Daily has carried the torch for a great many
fine causes on the campus, such as the preservation
of the ride to Paly tradition, and I believe that it
would be doing the present Eneinamen and future j
freshmen a great service if it would suggest that some '
impartial committee be appointed to investigate the !
food served here.
