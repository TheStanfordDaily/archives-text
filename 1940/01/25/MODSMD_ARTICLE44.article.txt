# Toyon Maestro
## Craig to Play At Hall Dance Former Stanfordite Returns for Evening 
### 
Carvel Craig, whose musical styl
ings have earned him a position
among Stanford's favorite bands,
will play for the Farm's first formal
dance of winter quarter in Toyon
Lobby tomorrow night from 9 to 1
o'clock.
After completing his "one-night
er" on campus, Craig will head north
to Seattle for a long engagement in
the Olympic Bowl, popular supper
room.
FULL COMPANY
Craig's full company, with 11
pieces, and Reges Clark, vocalist,
will entertain dancers at the Toyon-
Branner formal, according to Bob
Einstein, dance chairman.
With four violins, used effectively
in rhumba and tango interpretations,
the former Stanford maestro will
bring back to the Reservation his
distinctive "dancing time to rhythm
and rhyme." His band has been fea
tured over N.8.C., C.8.5., and Mu
tual broadcasting coast-to-coast net
works.
WINS PRAISE
Such New York columnists as
Walter Winchell, Nick Kenny, Mau
rice Zutlow, and such trade maga
zines as Variety and Billboard have
given Craig wide publicity for his
impressive, modern arrangements
and his smoothly-melodic tempos.
Toyon lobby, scene of tomorrow's
dance, has been decorated for the
occasion. Lighting will be effective,
while not ornate, Einstein declared.
Bids, offered to the entire campus at
$1.75 a couple, are on sale in the
A.S.S.U. office and may be obtained
at the door as long as they last, he
said.
