# 'Hunchback' Spectacular If Somewhat Overdone
## Laughton's Acting Excellent, But Hugo Wouldn't Know His Story 
### 
"THE lIUNCHDACK OF NOTRE DAME," now showing at the Fox
Stanford.
A terrific, dynamic, colossal, world-shaking, epoch-making feature is
rolling through the projector down in I'aly. It's also kaleidoscopic and
a trifle confusing, too. The flicker is notable for the well documented evi-

dence of the incredible ignorance
and superstition of *he Middle Ages,
and also for the fact that Charles
Laughton only has about 100 words
of dialogue in two and a half hours
of feature. In spite of that, he packs
more Thespian ability into those
few than all the rest of the cast
boiled in oil.
The production is far too long and
mystifying; plot is sacrificed for the
sake of the spectacle all the way
through. You get the feeling that if
the picture had been in Technicolor,
the mind would have snapped un
der the impact.
MOBS HANDLED WELL
But on the other hand, the hand
ling of the millions of extras in the
mob scenes is really excellent, and
the musical score will be one of the
notable ones of 1940.
Edmund O'Brien as the young
poet Gringoire and Maureen O'Hara
as the gypsy girl are two newcom
ers. Miss O'Hara manages to keep
herself pretty clean and unsullied
among all the medieval filth, too.
Sir Cedric Hardwicke is his usual
sinister self, as Ferolo the Chief
Justice, and Thomas .Mitchell acts
instead of mugs for a change as the
king of the beggars. Walter Hamp
den, of Shakespearean fame, turns
in a good characterization of the old
king.
HEAVILY MADE UP
Spectacular scenes, including that
of Laughton buried under tons of
"boo" make-up, are the festival, the
pillory, and the mob storming the
Cathedral to rescue the gal. You'll
also get quite a jolt when the hunch
back swings down on a rope and
spirits Esmeralda away right under
the hangman's eyes'.
Lon Chaney's version in the silent
days was faT more scary, as this de
partment recollects, and had him
swimming under water through the
sewers of gay Paree, breathing
through a sort of periscope. Either
way, Victor Hugo wouldn't recognize
his story.â€”Littleboy
