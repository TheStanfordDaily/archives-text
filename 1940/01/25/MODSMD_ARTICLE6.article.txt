# Farm Acclaims Tibbett's Voice
## Hall Packed; Baritone Gives Many Encores 
### 
America's beloved Lawrence Tib
bett gave Stanford everything he
had of glorious voice and friendly
charm in Memorial Hall last night.
Stanford responded with sincere
enthusiasm that called him back to
the stage time after time.
The entire program gave evi
dence of Mr. Tibbett's effort to sat
isfy a predominantly youthful au
dience, and no artist could have
been more gracious in responding to
special requests.
VERDI STANDS OUT
The three Verdi arias probably
occupied the stand-out spots in the
performance. "Eri Tu?" from The
Masked Ball a brilliant combi
nation of tenderness and hatred and,
as always, thunderous applause ac
claimed the popular "Cortigiani, vil
razza dannata" from Rigoletto.
The third Verdi selection, "lago's
Creed" from Othello, was included as
a special x - equest encore, and to
judge from the applause, a more
welcome choice was hardly pos
sible.
SPIRITUALS ALWAYS POPULAR
Other memorable selections in
cluded Malotte's "Among the Liv
ing," Loewe's "Edward," and
Tschaikowsky's "None but the Lone
ly Heart." As popular as ever was
the closing group of Negro spirituals,
particularly "Water Boy."
To round out a well-nigh perfect
evening, Mr. Tibbett's accompanist,
Stewart. Wille, drew an encore of
his own. A talented artist in his own
right, Mr. Wille put real feeling into
his selections, particularly "Ca
priccio" by Bortkiewicz.â€”Pat Smith
