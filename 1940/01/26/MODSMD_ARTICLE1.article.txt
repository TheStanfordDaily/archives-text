### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
r rHE phantom vision of a "just and
sensible peace" between Ger
many and the Allies to stem the
creeping tide of Bolshevism in west
ern and central Europe occupied the
attention of the Netherlands yes
terday.
The Foreign Minister of Holland
spoke in alarm against the Red
menace that threatens to swallow
the Continent. At the same time
Van Kleffens warned the belliger
ents against meddling with the neu
trality of cither the Netherlands or
Belgium.
This was a direct slap al the
broadcast of Winston Churchill
last week when he admonished
(lie neutrals to join the Allies in
their crusade against Germany.
With this statement of Holland's
opinion, almost all the neutral na
tions are on record as thoroughly
irked at Churchill. His speech, so
far. has provoked practically
nothing except criticism from the
powers struggling to keep out of
war.
Van Kleffens was both eloquent
and logical in his speech yesterday,
in sharp contrast to most orators in
war-crazed Europe. "I deny the ex
istence of any juridical or moral
duty on the part of Holland to par
ticipate in the war. We took care to
stand free and we maintain —as able
statesmen in other countries used to
understand in quieter times —that it
is our duty to be master of our own
house."

r PHE Dutch statesman pointed out
that lie believes neither side
will be able to conquer the other.
Regulation based on realism anW jus
tice, he said, with mutual respect
for the rights of other peoples guar
anteeing peace for a long time, can
not be reached. In some foreign pa
peitfs, he indicated, everybody who
dares to talk for peace is accused of
acting under the influence of somj
war-weary belligerent. But, he said,
"I think that this should keep no
body from contributing his bit to
the salvation and well-being of the
western world."
The foreign minister said that
the Belgian-Dutch crisis of last
November and again last week —
when rumors, still current, spread
throughout the land that the Ger
mans planned an invasion—were
not "taken light-heartedly and
were not without reason." As long
as his land remains independent
and thus, like Belgium, establishes
an element of quietude in Europe,
as long as it keeps its sense for
liberty, its pleasure in work, its
enterprise and pushing energy in
all directions, and so long as the
nation is willing to give up every
thing for the integrity of its ter
ritory and its independence, no
l>ig power can allow itself to see
"our territory in other hands in
Europe or in Asia," he said.

| IE was sorry for the rough hand
ling the Germans got at the
end of the World War I, he declared.
The small amount of aid given them
was a strong contrast to the aid
given France by other European na
tions after the Napoleonic Wars in
1815.
The last world war was a lesson
in how European post-war reor
ganizations should not be carried out.
At the same time, he said that Hol
land should remain a member of
the League of Nations and that the
government hadn't lost hope be
cause of the failure of the recent
joint peace efforts of Queen Wilhel
mina and King Leopold of the Bel
gians.
He took his parliamentary speech
as an occasion to blast at Britain's
seizure of the mails leaving Europe.
Holland was the first power to
voice its disapproval of English
seizure and halting of boats carrying
exports and mails from the Conti
nent. The United States followed
the Netherlands — and the issue is
still unsettled. Van Kleffens said
that Holland reserves all rights and
will "protest the practical applica
tion of this measure"—the British
blockade of German ports — when
and if the proper occasion arises.
