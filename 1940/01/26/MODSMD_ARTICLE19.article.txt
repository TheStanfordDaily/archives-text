J school can," said Jim Thurman yes
| terday, commenting on the possi
! bility of the Alpha Phi Omega's
! drive against infantile paralysis re
- suiting in 100 per cent contribution.
The drive had its origin last week
!in a Branner smoker, and Bill
' Moore and Thurman showed that it
j could be done on at least part of the
i campus by collecting not only one
| thin "marching" dime from each man
! in the hall but a respectable sur
i plus for good measure.
j Excotn got hold of the idea Wed
j nesday and awarded the responsi
bility of a campus-wide drive to
the pledges of the national honorary
| service fraternity with Al Nadeau as
general chairman and a $400 goal,
j With "Join the 400" as the drive
(slogan, contributions will be gath
ered until Wednesday of next week
| from boxes placed in all living
; groups and a thermometer on the
' Libe steps will record the (low of
j dimes from day to day.
Leaders of the drive also noted
I the great steps in research taken in
ihe last few years and remarked on
the work accomplished by Stanford,
1 California, and U.S.C. laboratories
with $77,000 given them by the state.
These funds were taken from the
I state's collection during last Jan

I amounted to something over $"00,000.
