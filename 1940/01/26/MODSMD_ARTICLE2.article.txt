# Cards Face Tough Battle In S.C. Tilt
## 'Split Series'' Is Hope Of Dean men in Race To Share Top Spot 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Even though Los Angeles is some
400 miles south of the Farm and Ber
keley is just across the bay, the bas
ketball series between Stanford and
the University of Southern California
is going to hog the sports spotlight
tonight and tomorrow. The games
will be broadcast at 8 o'clock.
California and U.C.L.A., currently
holding down cellar positions in the
Southern Division, scrap at Berke
ley, while our Indians and the Ter
rible Trojans make passes at each
other trying to decide the issue at
the top.
CARDS WOULD LIKE SPLIT
It would be to everyone's satis
faction on the Farm if Coach Everett
Dean's club splits the series. The
betting gentry on Los Angeles'
Spring Street probably were offer
ing even odds that the surprising
Indians would do just that thing
after taming Cal, 55-32, last Friday.
Their chances of winning a game,
and thus coming back still sharing
the division leadership, has been
slightly dimmed what with Fordy
Anderson, sophomore forward, still
in the hospital running a tempera
ture. The moaning over Anderson's
loss hasn't, however, exactly hit the
squad. They know that their clever
forward would make a lot of dif
ference in the scoring potentialities
of the team, but they also remember
that played only 10 min
utes against Cal and that the rest of
the time Leon Lafaille and Bob Penn
did a masterpiece of subbing.
TWELVE MAKE TRIP
Twelve players and Coaches Dean
and "Beeb" Lee of the frosh will
carry Stanford's fortunes against the
Trojans. The men are Don Williams,
Ken Davidson, Dick Taylor, Bill
Cowden, Lafaille, Penn, Gil Rahn,
Frank Wells, John Alltucker, Tiff
Denton, Bob Wensel, and Ralph
Meigs.
It will be interesting to note just
what tactics will be employed by
the rival coaches, Dean and Sam
Barry. Both clubs have shown high
scoring qualities while their defenses
have been equally important factors
in accounting for their splendid rec
ords to date. However, the concen
sus is that it will be more of an
offensive game than defensive. Then
there is the possibility that neither
team's high scorer will do much
either tonight or tomorrow.
That, however, will be up to the
respective guards of Ralph Vaughn,
