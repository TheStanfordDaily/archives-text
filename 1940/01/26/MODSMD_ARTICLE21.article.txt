# 'SADIES' TO REIGN AT DANCE
## Tables to Turn At Tomorrow's 'Hawkins' Hop 
### 
Women v/ill rule supreme on the
Farm tomorrow night.
For tomorrow night is the Sadie
Hawkins Hop in the Women's Gym
at 9 o'clock.
Little did A1 Capp know, a couple
! of years ago, when he conjured up
- the idea of a Sadie Hawkins Day in
his comic strip, "Li'l Abner," that
it would exert a profound nation
wide influence, reaching as far away
from the Kentucky mountains as the
| end ol Palm Drive.
Little did he know thai more than
200 college campuses and 188 cities
would practically convert his brain
' child into a new national holiday.

► Now it all started when Hezekiah
Hawkins, one of the influential set
tlers of Dogpatch, couldn't get his
daughter a husband. So one day
after Sadie had reached the ripe old
age of 35 without an offer, he gath
ered all the eligible bacheloi's to-
I gether. When he fired his gun the
j men started to run. On the second
I shot, Sadie started after them. If
she caught one, he had to marry her.
Well, she caught one of the boys,
and thus inspired the anger of all
1 the other old spinters. Thereupon
Sadie Hawkins Day was made an
annual event and any women who
caught a man in the annual chase
could make him her husband.
WOMEN STALK MEN
Within a very short time after the
| fateful comic strips appeared, Sadie
, Hawkins Days started springing up
I all over the country. Details dif
| fered but the general idea was the
; same—the setting of a time when
j girls might openly stalk the men
j folks and, upon capture, claim them
I for their own.
| Here on the Farm the claim is a
I little less drastic—merely that the
; men when summoned must let their
I particular Daisy Maes take them to
i the sophomore - sponsored Sadie
' Hawkins Hop tomorrow night. But
! Ihe Stanford men have changed an
! other detail. They are not running.
I In fact, they are waiting, wondering,
| and hoping that someone will ask
them to the Hop.
PET PKi IS PRIZE
They have even agreed to furnish
j transportation if their summoner
! does not have a car.
Sophomore women, headed by
! Chairman Ruth Whitney, have ar
i ranged several special features for
] the dance, which it is hoped will
! become an annual afTair. As a door
i prize will be given a "second cousin"

would practically convert his brain
' child into a new national holiday.

► Now it all started when Hezekiah
Hawkins, one of the influential set
tlers of Dogpatch, couldn't get his
daughter a husband. So one day
after Sadie had reached the ripe old
age of 35 without an offer, he gath
ered all the eligible bacheloi's to-
I gether. When he fired his gun the
j men started to run. On the second
I shot, Sadie started after them. If
she caught one, he had to marry her.
Well, she caught one of the boys,
and thus inspired the anger of all
1 the other old spinters. Thereupon
Sadie Hawkins Day was made an
annual event and any women who
caught a man in the annual chase
could make him her husband.
WOMEN STALK MEN
Within a very short time after the
| fateful comic strips appeared, Sadie
, Hawkins Days started springing up
I all over the country. Details dif

; same—the setting of a time when
j girls might openly stalk the men
j folks and, upon capture, claim them
I for their own.
| Here on the Farm the claim is a
I little less drastic—merely that the
; men when summoned must let their
I particular Daisy Maes take them to
i the sophomore - sponsored Sadie
' Hawkins Hop tomorrow night. But
! Ihe Stanford men have changed an
! other detail. They are not running.
I In fact, they are waiting, wondering,
| and hoping that someone will ask
them to the Hop.
