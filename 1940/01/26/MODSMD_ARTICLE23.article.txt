# U.S. Treaty Ends, Japan Faces Crisis
## Trade Pact Dropped In American Effort To Stall Nippon War 
### 
TOKYO, Friday, Jan. 2(3 (UP).â€”
The Japanese-American commercial
treaty, which has governed all basic
relations between the two great Pa
cific Ocean powers since 1911, ex
pired today and brought one of the
gravest crises that has confronted
the Nipponese empire since the
Russo-Japanese war.
The treaty was abrogated by
President Roosevelt six months ago
as part of the effort of the United
States government to restrain
Japanese military activities in China
and protect American rights in tliat
country.
TRADE ENDANGERED
Beginning at 12:01 a.m. today, in
the Japanese view, relations with the
United States were on a basis of do
mestic and international law, and
trade between the two countries,
valued conservatively at around
$250,000,000 a year, was certain to
be endangered.
It was made clear, however, that,
the action of the United States will
not alter Japan's China program or
cause this country to abandon its
determination to create a "new or
der in east Asia."
Diplomats saw a possibility, how
ever, that the drastic American move
may restrain the more ardent of the
extreme Japanese Nationalists and
contribute to more lenient terms by
Japan when peace with China finally
is made.
MEASURES TAKEN
The foreign office spokesman, in a
statement released at midnight, said
that trade relations for the moment
were expected to continue without
change becau.se of measures taken by
both governments to prevent the ap
plication of automatic penalties.
The advent of a "no treaty situa
tion," he said, is deplored in Japan
and would seem to be not desirable
from the viewpoint of the United
States because of dislocations in
Japanese - American trade which
may ensue.
Japan confidently hopes negotia
tions for some sort of an agreement,
can be continued, the spokesman
said.
TO SEEK READJUSTMENT
Citing the importance of mutually
beneficial trade relations and the ex
istence of many fields of endeavor
in which Japan and third powers
can co-operate to create a better
situation in east Asia, the spokes
man said the Japanese government
"deemed it appropriate to elucidate
further its position to the American
government and to seek a readjust
ment of relations."
The spokesman denied Japan
seeks to eliminate the "just and
reasonable interests of third powers
in China" and added the "Japanese
government has no intention of dis
criminating in any way against
American goods or vessels."
TRADERS UNEASY
Despite the government's reas
suring statements, the Domei News
Agency said traders were uneasy at
the prospects of a protracted no
treaty situation, fearing Washington
might decide at any moment unilat
erally to abolish the present situa
tion, thereby sharply affecting com
mercial transactions.
The agency believed, however, the
serious economic consequences which
will result in the United States from
a decrease of Japan's purchases in
that country will react on American
opinion and create a situation fa
vorable to the signing of a new
treaty.
