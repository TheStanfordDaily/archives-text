# Kiss—Don't Gargle, Says S.F. Doctor
## Osculation Generates Heat to Kill Germs, Is Physician's Edict 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 25 (UP).—
Kissing is "good for 'em," said Dr,
Simon L. Katzoff, San Francisco
physician, tonight when he heard
the University of California was
considering a two months' ban on
campus kissing to stop the spread
of colds and influenza.
"The University people have for
gotten their chemistry," Dr. Katzoff
said. "Kissing generates enough
heat to destroy the germs and it
builds up resistance."
Katzoff, who has been consulting
physician with the San Francisco
Institute of Human Relations for 20
years, said heat is the greatest anti
septic in the world, and the kisses
of virile youth are self-purifying.
NOTHING PLATONIC
"And 1 don't mean the kind be
tween Mrs. Brown and Mrs. Jones
at the Tuesday Bridge Club," he
added.
"Besides, the modern girl uses
enough lipstick and other paint to
kill any germ. There is no need for
hauling around a jug of diluted car
bolic acid to wash with after every
kiss.
"If there is an influenza epidemic
at the University, I might suggest
there has not been enough kissing
lately. Come to think of it, they
just got over their winter exams,
and probably they have been too
busy."
STIMULATING, HE SAYS
Dr. Katzoff said kissing stimulates
the circulation, which builds up the
resistance to al! contagious germs.
Dr. Katzoff said the heat generated
by a genuine kiss was comparable to
an electric action.
"It is like an electric current mag
netized by the masculine and femi
nine polarities," he explained.
University authorities said they
knew of no proposed ban on campus
kissing, but suggested the rumor
might have come from a recent
warning by Dr. William G. Donald,
University physician. Dr. Donald
warned students that influenza might
be prevalent during the next two
months and that it was a "mouth to
mouth" disease.
"SOUNDS FISHY"
"It sounds fishy," remarked Pro
vost Monroe E. Deutsch. "It is just
the kind of story that seems to
originate around universities."
Student Body President Jim Keene
said he knew of no impending regu
lations on campus kissing, but re
marked succinctly:
"I do not think the normal routine
of University students should be in
terrupted in any way."
Virginie Hoisholt, women's rep
resentative on the Student Council,
gasped, "Why, I never,'' when she
heard of the story.
"What do they think we are?" she
asked.

there has not been enough kissing
lately. Come to think of it, they
just got over their winter exams,
and probably they have been too
busy."
STIMULATING, HE SAYS
Dr. Katzoff said kissing stimulates
the circulation, which builds up the
resistance to al! contagious germs.
Dr. Katzoff said the heat generated
by a genuine kiss was comparable to
an electric action.
"It is like an electric current mag
netized by the masculine and femi
nine polarities," he explained.
University authorities said they
knew of no proposed ban on campus
kissing, but suggested the rumor
might have come from a recent
warning by Dr. William G. Donald,
University physician. Dr. Donald
warned students that influenza might
be prevalent during the next two
months and that it was a "mouth to
mouth" disease.
"SOUNDS FISHY"
"It sounds fishy," remarked Pro
vost Monroe E. Deutsch. "It is just
the kind of story that seems to
originate around universities."
Student Body President Jim Keene
said he knew of no impending regu
lations on campus kissing, but re
marked succinctly:
"I do not think the normal routine
of University students should be in
terrupted in any way."
Virginie Hoisholt, women's rep
resentative on the Student Council,
gasped, "Why, I never,'' when she
heard of the story.
"What do they think we are?" she
asked.
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 25 (UP).—
Kissing is "good for 'em," said Dr,
Simon L. Katzoff, San Francisco
physician, tonight when he heard
the University of California was
considering a two months' ban on
campus kissing to stop the spread
of colds and influenza.
"The University people have for
gotten their chemistry," Dr. Katzoff
said. "Kissing generates enough
heat to destroy the germs and it
builds up resistance."
Katzoff, who has been consulting
physician with the San Francisco
Institute of Human Relations for 20
years, said heat is the greatest anti
septic in the world, and the kisses
of virile youth are self-purifying.
NOTHING PLATONIC
"And 1 don't mean the kind be
tween Mrs. Brown and Mrs. Jones
at the Tuesday Bridge Club," he
added.
"Besides, the modern girl uses
enough lipstick and other paint to
kill any germ. There is no need for
hauling around a jug of diluted car
bolic acid to wash with after every
kiss.
"If there is an influenza epidemic
at the University, I might suggest
there has not been enough kissing
lately. Come to think of it, they
just got over their winter exams,
and probably they have been too
busy."
