# Indian Nine to Meet Semi-Pros
## Wolter's Sluggers Meet S.F. All-Stars Tomorrow On Stanford's Diamond Fans Put Faith in Cootie Thompson To Down Recreational Department Batters in Cardinals' Third Contest 
### 
Farm diamond fans will gel another look at Harry Wolter's 1!)40 Card
nine tomorrow afternoon when they play the San Francisco Recreation
Department All-Stars <111 the Sunken Diamond, if Che Diamond isn't ac
tually submerged. Game time will he 2:!!0. The All-Stars will bring down
a team of semi-pro and minor league ball players who winter in the Hay

Region.
The last two games have given
Coach Welter something of a line
on his material. Tomorrow's stall
ing line-up may turn out to be the
regular nine, although every man 011
the squad will probably play.
Cootie Thompson still rates as'the
aee of the Card pitching staff. The
big boy has looked very good in his
two appearances to date. Against
the Erie All-Stars he whiffed live
of the six men who faced him, and
Wednesday he blanked the power
ful Kenealy Seals during his three
inning stay on the mound.
FROSII IS SOUTHPAW
Claude Purkitt and Bill Masters
are the only other experienced
chuckers on the squad. Both have
shown a great deal of improvement
over last year.
Wo Iter is working on two new
moundmen with no previous varsity
experience, Russ Smith and Sid
Hayes. Smith, who did most of the
deceiving for last year's frosh nine,
is the only left hander on the staff.
He's inexperienced, and somewhat
wild, but has a good fast ball and
a sharp breaking hook.
Sid Hayes traded in his track
pants for a monkey suit, and shows
promise of becoming a fine pitcher.
Sid ran into a little trouble against
the Seals, but has a nice motion and
a lot of poise.
COSTELLO AT IST
Hal Costello is working in nicely
at first base. A junior college trans
ter, Costello banged out two doubles
and a single Wednesday, and is a
smooth fielder.
Dick Shortall, Monty Pfyl, and El
ton Boone have looked best in the
other infield positions so far, al
though Harry Parsons, another
transfer, has a good chance to get
the second base job.
Alex Cereghino has a long lead
on the other candidates for the cen
ter field position, although Johnny
Sturgeon has been hitting the ball
hard. Jim Verdieck and Norm
Juney lead the other outfield hope
fuls.

deceiving for last year's frosh nine,
is the only left hander on the staff.
He's inexperienced, and somewhat
wild, but has a good fast ball and
a sharp breaking hook.
Sid Hayes traded in his track
pants for a monkey suit, and shows
promise of becoming a fine pitcher.
Sid ran into a little trouble against
the Seals, but has a nice motion and
a lot of poise.
COSTELLO AT IST
Hal Costello is working in nicely
at first base. A junior college trans
ter, Costello banged out two doubles
and a single Wednesday, and is a
smooth fielder.
Dick Shortall, Monty Pfyl, and El
ton Boone have looked best in the
other infield positions so far, al
though Harry Parsons, another
transfer, has a good chance to get
the second base job.
Alex Cereghino has a long lead
on the other candidates for the cen
ter field position, although Johnny
Sturgeon has been hitting the ball
hard. Jim Verdieck and Norm
Juney lead the other outfield hope
fuls.
Farm diamond fans will gel another look at Harry Wolter's 1!)40 Card
nine tomorrow afternoon when they play the San Francisco Recreation
Department All-Stars <111 the Sunken Diamond, if Che Diamond isn't ac
tually submerged. Game time will he 2:!!0. The All-Stars will bring down
a team of semi-pro and minor league ball players who winter in the Hay

Region.
The last two games have given
Coach Welter something of a line
on his material. Tomorrow's stall
ing line-up may turn out to be the
regular nine, although every man 011
the squad will probably play.
Cootie Thompson still rates as'the
aee of the Card pitching staff. The
big boy has looked very good in his
two appearances to date. Against
the Erie All-Stars he whiffed live
of the six men who faced him, and
Wednesday he blanked the power
ful Kenealy Seals during his three
inning stay on the mound.
FROSII IS SOUTHPAW
Claude Purkitt and Bill Masters
are the only other experienced
chuckers on the squad. Both have
shown a great deal of improvement
over last year.
Wo Iter is working on two new
moundmen with no previous varsity
experience, Russ Smith and Sid
Hayes. Smith, who did most of the
deceiving for last year's frosh nine,
is the only left hander on the staff.
He's inexperienced, and somewhat
