BUNK YOUII EYES—
NEW TRACK MENTOR
It certainly is a fine thing when
a person can't even trust the ad
ministrative staff of his own uni
versity. Here we innocently decide
to take a short vacation from the
typewriter to enable a mashed hand
to heal, and what does the afore
mentioned Administration do but
select a new track coach the same
day a gracious guest columnist eu
logizes the present mentor.
Furthermore, we suspect an in
sidious plot on the part of the
higher-ups to undermine the au
thoritativeness of The Daily in the
fact that they didn't announce
their decision until it was too late
to make a couple of changes in
the guest column that dealt with
the Man Who Was Stabbed in the
Back.
By golly, fellows, it's tough
enough trying to rake up guest col
umnists without you making it
tougher by ridiculing their columns
by your decisions.

Franklin Pitcher Johnson becomes
Stanford's new track coach, effec
tive next fall. He was selected a year
previous to his actually taking over,
says a B.A.C. member, to "preclude
any possibility of verbal battles in
the local press and between various
alumni factions. The bad publicity
of that long campaign has been
avoided by the early selection . . ."
So old Bill Ellington will not he
Stanford's head track coach next
year. No matter how successfully
his trackmen come through the
11)40 season. "Pitch" Johnson will
take over the reins in 1941. The
B.A.C. decided Old Bill just wasn't
the man for the position, although
it is questionable just how they
came to that decision, what with
Old Bill having yet to lead his first
team into battle.
• It has been pointed out that Bill
was practically head coach for three
years while Dink Templeton was
confined with illness. But anyone
who knows Dink also knows that
Bill didn't get much of a chance to
put his own ideas into practice as
long as Dink was well enough to
talk.

But the B.A.C. didn't want any
"bad publicity" — which must
mean criticism of their actions. The
B.A.C. didn't want any alumni fac
tions—after all, an alumni faction
might want Ellington to remain.
But if the B.A.C. thinks it has es
caped criticism by naming a new
coach so far in advance, they should
hear what most of the track men
think.
This is not directed at Johnson,
who, for all we know, may be the
greatest coach in the world. There
is just a matter of lack of principle
and fairness involved that grates
against our grain.
