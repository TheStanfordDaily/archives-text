# Reno Ski Tryouts Set for Week-end
## 
### 
Final ski team tryouts and the
selection of those who will compete
in the Reno carnival meet will be
held by the Ski Club tomorrow and
Sunday at Yosemite.
With skiing already good at Bad
ger Pass, where the depth s of the
snow is 39 inches, a new fall has
started, assuring light powdery snow
for the week-end.

[ This will be the final practice for
the team before the carnival, which
will be held next week-end, Feb. 2,
! 3, and 4 under the direction of stu
i dents of the University of Nevada.
For those who prefer to be specta
tors, many of California's best skat
i ers will be competing in the 7th
Annual California State Champion-
I ships this week-end on the outdoor
i rink at Yosemite.
