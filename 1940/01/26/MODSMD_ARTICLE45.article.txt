# Greenhorns on Skis
## 
### 
HAVE you noticed how many people have
been hobbling around the campus on
crutches this week? "Skiers," you may con
clude â€”but you are wrong. They are not skiers.
It is true that the few broken legs and the
many sprained ankles were acquired during
the course of last week-end's trips to the snow,
but they resulted from too little skiing rather
than too much. In almost every case those who
have had experience in the sport have arrived
home quite whole, and the novices are the ones
who have been injured.
No one, not even a Stanford superman (or
a Roble woman) can learn to ski in one week
end. If those who visit Yosemite, or some other
winter resort, for the first time would use a
little judgment, accidents would be avoided.
Instead of attempting the big runs right away,
they should first gain experience on the prac
tice slopes.
Despite the fact that ii is suffering the tem
porary disadvantage of being fashionable, ski
ing is one of the finest, healthiest, most enjoy
able of all sports. And if it is indulged in sen
sibly, the chance of injury is not great.
Therefore, this week-end, and every week
end until the last snow melts, let all Stanford
skiers realize their own limitations. Let green
horns stay away from the steeper, faster slopes.
For the only thing that can ruin Stanford's
skiing is too many accidents.
