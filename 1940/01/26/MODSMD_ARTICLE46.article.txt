# Comes the Revolution

### 
TWO surprisingly good - looking Stanford
women were walking past the Bookstore
toward the Education Building yesterday after
noon. About to cross the street, they paused at
the curb as a snappy convertible came charging
down the Row. Speeding around the corner,
it splashed a great wave of muddy, water all
over the skirts and stockings of the fair pedes
trians.
And the driver of the car sped on.
Now anyone who is at all acquainted with
the campus roads knows that they were never
designed for wet-weather driving. At the first
sign of rain those ravines and chuck-holes in
the asphalt get so full of water that you could
almost make a gullible stranger believe that he
is in a speeding motor boat.
Huge waves dash over the sides of the carâ€”
and they also splash over any unfortunate pe
destrian who happens to get in the way.
Now that the rain definitely seems to be with
us, perhaps it would be a neat idea if Stanford
drivers would exercise a little care at all pedes
trian crossings and intersections. This business
of splashing the walking populace smacks a
bit too strongly of the habits of pre-Revolution
French aristocrats.
If there were any justice, offenders would
be punished in a Lake Lagunita ducking-stool.
