STANFORD has its fingers crossed today.
Stanford thinks it has a winning athletic
team. It has found out week after week what
it is to lose, and now it thinks it has found a
bunch who can win. But Stanford is afraid to
believe, really believe, that that is so.
Everett Dean took his basketball team back
East, and they did win all but one of their
games. They have won all their games here
on the Farm since winter quarter began, in
cluding three conference games. And in one
of those they did give Cal one of the worst
beatings in their rivalry.
But Stanford can't help fearing U.S.C. today.
Coast newspapers say U.S.C. is king. Long
Island University played the Trojans this year,
and its record bears the scar of that game.
Even in the Middle West, where basketball is

to the hoi polloi what the Civil War was to
Scarlett O'Hara's contemporaries, U.S.C. is
mentioned with respect,
Stanford has its fingers crossed.
There is no question but that Stanford will
be in the southern division Conference race this
year. That is clear. But what Stanford wants is
a team that will come out undisputedly on top.
That means beating U.S.C. in at least two of their
four-game series.
The sports pages have said that the Trojans'
Ralph Vaughn is a better player than Hank
Luisetti. Those at Stanford who saw Luisetti
play say definitely that it is not so.
But no one at Stanford is saying definitely
that Stanford will win tomorrow. They think
Stanford can win. They hope Stanford will
win. They've got their fingers crossed.â€”D. J.
