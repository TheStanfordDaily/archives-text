### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
WHEN YOU COME RIGHT DOWN TO IT
A VERY practical girl on the Daily staff walked into
the Shack today with a campus opinion burning
in her breast. She decided not to write it, however;
so I feel free to steal her ideas.
"Why," she demanded, "is there so much criticism
of women around here? It only creates verbal hatred.
And when you come right down to it, everybody likes
everybody else anyway."
"Partially true," I had to admit. "Almost everybody
likes quite a few people."
"Well," said the advocate of peaceful boy-girl rela
tions, "how about you? Don't you really like the
women —when you come right down to it?"
And there the lady-apostle of the peace-loving sex
really had me. Yes, when you come right down to it,
most of us really like women—really.
We criticize feminine artifices; we condemn the
Stanford brand as being slow, fast, affected, or what
have-you. But, to quote our lady-critic, we just
couldn't do without women.
* * * *
CUCH a profound analysis of the woman situation
reminds one of those great debates we all used to
have when we were six. "I'd rather be a boy than a
girl," we said to the little neighbor-girl. "I wouldn't,"
the little neighbor-girl retorted. "Well," we pointed
out triumphantly, "how could you get along without
men to make a living for you?" "Is that so?" the
little girl replied. "Well, where would you be if you
didn't have a mother?" That stopped us. We didn't
know.
And at the age of six we had reached a philosoph
ically invulnerable impasse: Men can't get along with
out women, and vice-versa. But there was an impli
cation of this truistic philosophy which was just pointed
out to me today—by the girl on the Daily staff. If
women and men are mutually indispensable, why
should they criticize one another?
Just think of the misguided married couples who
go around violating this fundamental truth! Why, it's
appalling. If I ever have a wife I am certainly going
to impress upon her the fact that she cannot logically
criticize me.
And I am trying very hard not to muse over my
hypothetical wife's reaction. One thing that invariably
occurs to me, though, is that she might discover that
she could do without me, individually. I hope, but
can't see why, she won't think of that.
Anyhow, we who have criticized Stanford women
certainly ought to observe a little more humility—l
suppose. No matter what you say about them, women
are a very real institution.
Yup! It looks like they're here to stay.

in her breast. She decided not to write it, however;
so I feel free to steal her ideas.
"Why," she demanded, "is there so much criticism
of women around here? It only creates verbal hatred.
And when you come right down to it, everybody likes
everybody else anyway."
"Partially true," I had to admit. "Almost everybody
likes quite a few people."
"Well," said the advocate of peaceful boy-girl rela
tions, "how about you? Don't you really like the
women —when you come right down to it?"
And there the lady-apostle of the peace-loving sex
really had me. Yes, when you come right down to it,
most of us really like women—really.
We criticize feminine artifices; we condemn the
Stanford brand as being slow, fast, affected, or what
have-you. But, to quote our lady-critic, we just
couldn't do without women.

CUCH a profound analysis of the woman situation
reminds one of those great debates we all used to
have when we were six. "I'd rather be a boy than a
girl," we said to the little neighbor-girl. "I wouldn't,"
the little neighbor-girl retorted. "Well," we pointed
out triumphantly, "how could you get along without
men to make a living for you?" "Is that so?" the
little girl replied. "Well, where would you be if you
didn't have a mother?" That stopped us. We didn't
know.
And at the age of six we had reached a philosoph
ically invulnerable impasse: Men can't get along with
out women, and vice-versa. But there was an impli
cation of this truistic philosophy which was just pointed
out to me today—by the girl on the Daily staff. If
women and men are mutually indispensable, why
should they criticize one another?
Just think of the misguided married couples who
go around violating this fundamental truth! Why, it's
appalling. If I ever have a wife I am certainly going
to impress upon her the fact that she cannot logically
criticize me.
And I am trying very hard not to muse over my
hypothetical wife's reaction. One thing that invariably
occurs to me, though, is that she might discover that
she could do without me, individually. I hope, but
can't see why, she won't think of that.
Anyhow, we who have criticized Stanford women
certainly ought to observe a little more humility—l
suppose. No matter what you say about them, women
are a very real institution.
Yup! It looks like they're here to stay.
WHEN YOU COME RIGHT DOWN TO IT
A VERY practical girl on the Daily staff walked into
the Shack today with a campus opinion burning
in her breast. She decided not to write it, however;
so I feel free to steal her ideas.

of women around here? It only creates verbal hatred.
