## PRO-PREFERENTIAL 
### 
r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
In yesterday's Bull Session, Mellinkoff pointed
out that under the preferential ballot system many a
voter does not give second choice to the candidate he
considers second best. Wishing to aid the candidate of
his first choice, the voter may give his second choice to
the candidate he considers to be the weakest com
petitor; he thus "stabs" the man who appears to be
the strongest competitor against the first-choice can
didate. I agree that many people do vote this way
and that such voting is undesirable. However, the
fault, is not with the preferential system but rather
with the voters who fail to undei'stand it.
The second choice on any ballot is not considered
unless the first-choice candidate on that ballot has
been eliminated from the race. Thus whether we vote
for Miss Peach or for Mr. Prune as second choice it
will not be considered at all unless Mr. Lemon, our
first choice, has been put out of the running. And
if Mr. Lemon has been put out of the running, it is
obvious that no good can be done for his cause lay
voting for the weakest of the other two candidates.
But we should, therefore, vote for the BEST of the
other two candidates for our second choice. Chi
canery will avail us nothing.
Therefore it seems to me that the preferential sys
tem is not open to criticism on this account. And
rather than changing the system, we should wise up
the voters.
Sincerely,
Reid Moran
