# NEUTRAL LECTURE SERIES
## 
### 
r JPHE EDITOR, SIK:
I do not wish to be drawn into the already tire
some argument revolving around the A.S.U. I simply
would like to say a few words in explanation of the
choice of speakers for this year's Lecture Series.
Both Alfred Duff Cooper and Eve Curie were
signed to appear at Stanford long before the present
European war broke out. Both were signed before
they received their present appointments as agents of
their countries. Consequently, any discussion of motive
in signing these two speakers is pointless.
Personally, I want to hear what these speakers
have to say. I agree with The Daily's stand that, the
lectures should be given, and hasten to recommend
that anyone incapable of taking into consideration who
is doing the talking should stay home.
Grey son Bryan,
Chairman, A.S.S.U. Lecture Series
