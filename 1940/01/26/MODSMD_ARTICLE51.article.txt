# REPAVE PALM DRIVE
## 
### 
'"THE EDITOR, SIR:
It seems to be apparent that most of the roads
on the Stanford campus are in pretty pooc shape
with their ruts, holes, and generally poor surface.
Now that one entrance into Palo Alto is cut off. and as
a result Palm Drive is, to a great, extent, dead, why
could not the University close Palm Drive from traffic
and repave it?
Certainly it is a bad road, presents an unpleasant
appearance to visitors to our campus, and is unfit
for heavy traffic. This seems to be the ideal time for
such a project. What does the campus think of the
suggestion?
