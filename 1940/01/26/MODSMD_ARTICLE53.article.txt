# Turkey Seeks Quake Counsel
## 
### 
For use in reconstruction follow
ing the recent quake in Turkey, in
formation about earthquake-resist
ant structures in California was re
quested in a letter received by
Bailey Willis, emeritus professor of
geology, early this week.
The letter came from American
Red Cross headquarters, and the
information will be relayed through
them to the Turkish national gov
ernment.
Research on earthquake - proof
construction has been carried on in
the geology department, since the
local shock of 1906, according to Dr.
Willis. Dr. John C. Branner, founder
of the department and second presi
dent of the University, originated
the studies in the hope that people
might some day build safely in
earthquake areas, Dr. Willis said.
Many of the buildings in Turkey,
according to Dr. Willis, are built of
mud and stone; walls are con
structed about 18 inches apart, and
filled with rubbish of all sorts. Ar
cheologists have found valuable
carvings and statues inside these
walls, as well as rags and tin cans.
As the habits of the people can
not be changed to a large extent, Dr.
Willis' main recommendation is the
use of iron rods to be bolted through
the walls with washes and nuts.
This type of construction has been
used successfully in Palestine under
British government regulations, to
solve similar earthquake problems,
he stated.
A University of Southern Califor
nia professor has just completed a
survey which shows that the average
cost to a student for cutting a class
runs to about $1.30.
