# Cold Epidemic Fills Hospital
## 'Pest House' Opened To Relieve Overflow 
### 
To prevent over-crowding of the
Palo Alto Hospital, the Isolation
Hospital on Old Portolu Road will
be opened to students, according to
Dr. Thomas A. Storey, medical ad
viser of men.
The number of respiratory infec
tions and colds, which has reached
its . usual late-January peak, has
made it. necessary to provide extra
accommodations. The Isolation Hos
pital will be ready for occupancy
today, and will remain open until
the new annex to the Palo Alto Hos
pital is completed, within the next
three weeks.
'"We want the students to have
the best hospital accommodations we
can provide for them," Dr. Storey
explained, pointing out that for ade
quate medical care it is best to keep
occupancy of the Palo Alto Hospi
tal within its normal capacity.
New equipment has been installed,
including new heating and lighting
systems to make the so-called plague
house comfortable. It will be admin
istered under the supervision of the
hospital.
