VANCOUVER, 8.C., Jan. 25 (UP).
â€”Criticism of Canada's war-time
defense regulations broke forth
anew today as the left-wing Co-op
crative Commonwealth Federation
considered a possible mass protest
meeting.
Secretary Herbert Hargrave said
he received an "unsatisfactory" re
ply from the office of Prime Min
ister MacKenzie King to protests
against restrictive features of the
regulations.
