### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
r PHE Allies are fighting a sloppy
war. Not content to allow mili
tary affairs to drift through the quiet
winter months, England and France
have found ways of antagonizing
neutral powers whose European
sympathy would be a valuable asset
to their cause.
All England has to do is unleash
Winston Churchill. Give the first
lord of the Admiralty a microphone
and let him make enemies of all the
Continent's neutrals. Two weeks ago
he told them which side their bread
was buttered on. "Join the Allies,"
he said. Resenting the inference
that they were incapable of making
an intelligent decision, Europe's
neutrals promptly told England and
her belligerent spokesman that
they knew precisely what the hell
they were doing—without any out
side advice. The adverse effects of
Churchill's speech are growing
rather than diminishing as time
passes.
If one can judge by the tone of
the Italian press, the friendship of
Hie Balkans toward Britain and
Fiance has cooled considerably in
Ihe past few weeks. There was a
time when the Allies could count
on the support of the entire Bal
kan bloc, but that time has gone.
The Anglo-French pressure of Ru
mania because of her large supply
of oil is definitely driving Rumania
closer to her Balkan neighbors—
and. hence, into the orbit of Ital
ian influence.

yi ND, as a result, Rumania is more
willing now than she was two
weeks ago to reach a compromise
with Hungary and Bulgaria on their
territorial claims against her. If the
Balkan nations solve all their cur
rent troubles and reach an entente,
with Italy as the king-pin, the Allies
will be forced to deal with Musso
lini. And the fascist chief, who has
been angling for Balkan support for
a long time now, will be in a con
siderably more potent position.
Soon after the outbreak of the
war, the world felt that all was
not well in the Rome-Berlin axis.
Mussolini, like a clever horse
trader, was shying away from too
close an alignment with Hitler.
The Italians were playing the per
centages. Incensed at Hitler's "un
holy alliance" with Russia, Mus
solini was unwilling to support the
Nazis in any substantial way. Ob
servers were willing to wager that
Italy might stage a repetition of
her maneuvers in World War I.
Everyone thought she would hop
the Allied bandwagon if it came
to a showdown. While Italian in
terests are. of necessity, centered
primarily in the Balkans, her po
sition in northern Europe is stra
tegic.

onized Italy by halting her boats
—many of them bearing German
manufactured goods that have been
shipped across the Alps to Italian
ports—and since always-tactful Mr.
Churchill has not bettered matters
by preaching the Allied gospel to
neutrals, there has been a noticeable
shift in Italian sympathy toward the
German cause.
Meanwhile Germany, satisfied
with her victory in the struggle
for Rumanian oil. has assured Ihe
Bucharest government that it need
not fear any imminent Russian
attempt to seize Bessarabia. No
one seems to know the exact scope
of Hitler's reported assurances to
King Carol 11, hut Germany seems
confident of continued large oil
shipments from Rumania and is
anxious to preserve peace in the
Balkans as protection for these
shipments as well as for large
supplies of grain and foodstuffs.
