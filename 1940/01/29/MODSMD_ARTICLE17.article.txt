# 'Mystery Man' Of Farm Lives In Vivid Legend
## Peter Coutts, Famed In Campus History, Has Unsolved Story 
### BUD AMES 
The mystery of Peter Coutts, the
Farm's "eccentric old Frenchman,"
still goes unsolved. Exactly who
was he; why did he come to Cali
fornia? Questions concerning him
are countless; unquestionable an
swers are few. We can only guess.
Known it is, however, that in the
spring of 1875 a heavy-set, distin
guished-looking Frenchman, who
gave his name as Peter Coutts, came
with his wife and two children to
establish a home on what is now
the Stanford campus. He was then
63. Early Mayficlders recalled his
sparse white hair, his cane, his snufl
box, and the long tufts of hair which
grew out of his ears.
FLED FROM FRANCE
His real name was Paulin Caperon.
He had taken the name and identi
fication papers of Peter Coutts, his
cousin, as a means of fleeing France,
then engaged in the Franco-Prussian
War. But why did he flee his noted
position as publisher of the news
paper "La Liberte"?
Almost a dozen theories have been
given, but of these, only four are
worth mentioning. They are that
Peter Coutts fled France after:
(1) Antagonizing Napoleon 111 by
opposing France's entry into the
Franco-Prussian War.
(2) Murdering a member of the
nobility.
(3) Disappearing from his office
as Paymaster General in the French
army, leaving a $5,000,000 shortage.
(4) Absconding with money de
posited in his brother's Strassburg
bank and refusing to pay war tax
on that money.
COUTTSPARDONED
Of these four theories, opinion
seems to be that the first is correct,
because in 1882 Coutts was pardoned
and allowed to return to France. His
reasons for fleeing were, then, po
litical, ndot criminal.
In 1875, Peter Coutts purchased
1400 acres which were later to be
come a part of the 8,247.64-acrc
Stanford farm and placed them in
trust for his two children. His me
dieval tastes soon took the material
form of a chalet, which Dr. Jordan
later named Escondite Cottage, and
of a brick library which he crammed
with 8000 valuable volumes, the
product of Elzevirs, famous Italian |
typographers.
Peter Coutts loved the soil and !
called California "the coming coun- \
try." At once he set about creating !
the ideal farm. He stocked the |
land with fine horses and blooded J
cattle with which he won many ;
prizes at Sacramento fairs. His pride i
was a 100-stall barn. In 99 of the
stalls he kept choicest Ayershire ,
and Holstein cows, in the remaining !
one a large ox which he named j
"Monsieur Curate." Each cow was
scrupulously attended, provided
with a silver bell, and given a name
such as "Madame Cosette" or "Ma
dame Marie."
SOUGHT WATER SUPPLY
He also tunneled his land with
over two miles of tunnels, seeking an
underground river which would
flood his land and irrigate his crops.
For two years men burrowed day |
and night but discovered no river.
In all they dug six tunnels converg
ing from the artificial lake which
Coutts had walled off at the foot
of Mystery Hill.
Today remnants of only three of
these tunnels remain. One colorful j
story has it that Coutts had a secret i
refuge in one of these tunnels, and :
that hearing that the San Francisco |
French consul was coming to Palo ;
Alto to question him, he had fled to j
this underground room. There, he
lost the key to the door, and when j
the gophers blocked the air pas- j
sages, he and his family suffocated, j
This is just another of the stories I
told concerning his sudden and ques- !
tionable disappearance.
Still standing as a reminder of j
Coutts' love of the medieval is i
"Frenchman's Tower," a doorless 1
brick tower which he planned as the !
location of a large water tank. He j
planned to pump water from the j
creek up into this tower and from I
there ot his gardens near the lake I
via pipes or underground tunnels. j
Coutts gave or made work for i
many neighboring people. Once he j
advertised for "100 men not afraid j
of hard work," and when many more I
came he made up jobs for all. Al- I

ways he gave preference to married
men. Gophers were his enemies,
and he once—or so it is told—or
dered his workmen to fill up all the
gopher holes on his 1400-acre tract.
That he hired many workers was
evidenced by his eye-opening pay
roll. Every Friday 5.000 silver dol
lars would arrive, from San Fran
cisco and on Saturday another $2500
in gold from San Jose. Where he got
this money is not known.
Coutts also loved the trees, and
he spent a major portion of his time
landscaping. Many of the Farm's
trees were planted by him or by his
workers. Many he started from
acorns, and all his landscaping he did
"as though he was going to live
400 years," as he put it.
SUDDEN DISAPPEARANCE
And then suddenly Peter Coutts
disappeared. He left most of his
personal belongings. Back to Brus
sels he went, and there built a castle
at Evain-les-Bains. Soon after in
1888 he moved to his Paris town
house, where he died two years
later.
In 1890, Paulin Caperon, alias
Peter Coutts, died, far from his be
loved home here, what is today a
part of our Quad. But the colorful
stories of him and his life continue
on and on.
