# 'Mystery Man' Of Farm Lives In Vivid Legend
## Peter Coutts, Famed In Campus History, Has Unsolved Story 
### BUD AMES 
The mystery of Peter Coutts, the
Farm's "eccentric old Frenchman,"
still goes unsolved. Exactly who
was he; why did he come to Cali
fornia? Questions concerning him
are countless; unquestionable an
swers are few. We can only guess.
Known it is, however, that in the
spring of 1875 a heavy-set, distin
guished-looking Frenchman, who
gave his name as Peter Coutts, came
with his wife and two children to
establish a home on what is now
the Stanford campus. He was then
63. Early Mayficlders recalled his
sparse white hair, his cane, his snufl
box, and the long tufts of hair which
grew out of his ears.
FLED FROM FRANCE
His real name was Paulin Caperon.
He had taken the name and identi
fication papers of Peter Coutts, his
cousin, as a means of fleeing France,
then engaged in the Franco-Prussian
War. But why did he flee his noted
position as publisher of the news
paper "La Liberte"?
Almost a dozen theories have been
given, but of these, only four are
worth mentioning. They are that
Peter Coutts fled France after:
(1) Antagonizing Napoleon 111 by
opposing France's entry into the
Franco-Prussian War.
(2) Murdering a member of the
nobility.
(3) Disappearing from his office
as Paymaster General in the French
army, leaving a $5,000,000 shortage.
(4) Absconding with money de
posited in his brother's Strassburg
bank and refusing to pay war tax
on that money.
COUTTSPARDONED
Of these four theories, opinion
seems to be that the first is correct,
because in 1882 Coutts was pardoned
and allowed to return to France. His
reasons for fleeing were, then, po
litical, ndot criminal.
In 1875, Peter Coutts purchased
1400 acres which were later to be
come a part of the 8,247.64-acrc
Stanford farm and placed them in
trust for his two children. His me
dieval tastes soon took the material
form of a chalet, which Dr. Jordan
later named Escondite Cottage, and
of a brick library which he crammed
with 8000 valuable volumes, the
