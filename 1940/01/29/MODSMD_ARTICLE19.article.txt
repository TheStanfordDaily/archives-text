# Vatican Report Discloses Persecution of Catholics By Nazi Police in Poland
## Documents Prepared for Pius XII Claim at Least 15 Priests Killed, Church Properties Confiscated 
### 
\ AI I( AN ( II Y, Jan. IK (LP).—Scnsalionsl allegations of the. wide
spread murder and persecution of Catholic priests in Poland by the Ger
man Gestapo (secret police) and soldiers arc contained in documents pre
pared for Pope Pius XII, it was revealed todr-y by Polish sources at the
Vatican.
The detailed documents were said to bear the authorization of Cardinal
Hlond, primate of Poland, and list with names and dates at least l. r > priests

to have been killed by shoot
ing, beating and ill treatment at the
hands of the Germans.
The report describes how Gestapo
agents, in the middle of the night,
swoop down on homes, herd together
Polish civilians at the point of guns
and haul them away to prison camps,
later to exile them "into the un
known."
POLKS OUSTED
The report to the Pope dwelt in
detail on the chaotic conditions said
to prevail in the archdioceses of
Poznan (Posen) and Gniezno, which
have been incorporated into the
Reich and from which all Poles are
being removed.
"The persecution soon will have
achieved its aim," it was said.
"The most Catholic diocese of
Poland with more than 7,000,000
Catholics will soon become a land
of infidels."
The report described indignities
inflicted upon priests and nuns,
wholesale confiscation of church
property and funds and "orgies" by
the Gestapo in seized churches.
FORCED EXODUS
"Without mentioning the public
and secret shootings, without ex
posing the horrors being committed
in prisons and concentration camps,
mention must nevertheless be made
of the forced expulsion of the popu
lation from these (two) archdio
ceses," the report said.
"Almost the entire Polish nobility,
particularly landowners, tens of
thousands of peasant families, town
dwellers and almost all the culture
class were exiled by the general
government.
"They lose all—everything they
own and hold dear—which they are
deprived of without compassion or
retribution. Their money is even
stolen from them and they arc only
allowed to take 10 marks (nominally
about $4) with them. Only a few
industrial and agricultural workers
and servants are left on the spot."
RADIO PROTESTS
The documents follow recent
broadcasts by the Vatican radio sta
tion of accounts of "inexcusable ex
cesses" in German-occupied Poland
and formal complaints by the Ger
man ambassador to the Holy See, Dr.
Diego von Bergen, against the broad
casts. One of these accounts was by
a speaker identified as a Jesuit priest,
recently escaped from Poland.
The new documents prepared for
Pope Pius Xll's study purport to
describe not only the murder of
priests but the confiscation of church
funds, the stripping of basilicas of
precious ornaments, and the humili
ating of priests and profaning of
church symbols.
Not only priests but nuns have
been subjected to this persecution
and humiliation, the report alleges,
and children have been turned out
of Catholic orphanages.
Where churches remain, it was
said, they are allowed to be open
only on Sundays from 9 to 11 a.m.
and sermons must be in the German"
language, although few sermons are
preached "since they serve as a pre
text. for the elimination of priests."
