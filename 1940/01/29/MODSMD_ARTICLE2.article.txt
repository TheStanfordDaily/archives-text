# Grad School To Conduct Smoking Poll
## Campus-wide Survey Questions Smokers On Habits, Attitudes 
### 
To discover the percentage of
Stanford students who do smoke,
don't smoke—and why—loo students
in the first year class of the Grad
uate School of Business will carry
out a campus-wide survey which
will begin with the distribution of
questionnaires to all eating groups
this noon. The poll will be an ex
ercise in compiling and interpreting
statistics for the business students as
well as an informational account for
the benefit of the Farm as a whole.
Dick Stepp, student chairman in
charge of publicity, said yesterday
that off-campus eating groups, the
Cellar, the Halls, and the houses on
the Row will distribute the "forms to
be filled out during the noon meal
today, and that everyone on cam
pus is expected to receive a blank.
He asked especially that the women
bring pencils to the table with them
to enable the presidents of the liv
ing groups to get the forms filled out
and returned as soon as possible.
DEANS APPROVE'
Technical adviser of the survey is
Professor Robert T. Martin, who in
1930-35 was editor of the "Statis
tical Abstract of the United States."
Both Miss Mary Yost, dean of wom
en, and John Bunn, dean of men,
approve the poll, Stepp declared.
Miss Yost said yesterday that she is
"very interested in the survey."
The data will be tabulated by
various committees of the class and
results will be published in The
Daily in three or four weeks.
The questionnaires are • divided
into three sections as follows: Gen
eral (age, major, should students
smoke on Quad); to non-smokers

dices against smoking); and to

moted by any tobacco firm, Stepp
declared.
