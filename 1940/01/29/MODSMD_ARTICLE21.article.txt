# Soviets Fail To Outflank Finnish Line
## Finns Turn Offense into 'Dismal Failure,' Drive Against Reds 
### 
HELSINKI, Jan. 28 (UP).—Fin- j
nish forces were reported tonight to j
have turned the tide of Russia's ;
eight-day offensive north of Luke
Ladoga and to be advancing at sev- j
oral points against the Red army's ;
badly battered divisions.
What was to have been a decisive
blow to smash Finland's Mannerheim j
Line on the Karelian isthmus from j
the rear and left flank ha.> turned out j
to be another "dismal failure" such j
as the frustrated Russian attempt to j
cut Finland in half at her narrow j
waistline, military leaders here said. !
It was reported in Helsinki to- :
night that General Scmion Budenny, ;
famous swashbuckling Russian cav- j
airy leader whose exploits are Rus- j
•sian folklore, is commanding the'
Red army's attacks after the "dis- I
grace" of General Kyril A. Mere- |
tskov, commander of the Leningrad i
military district.
ATTACKS WEAKEN
Tonight's military communique, I
describing yesterday's battles above i
the northern shore of Lake Ladoga, ]
said the Russian attacks were j
"weaker than on previous days" and I
that hundreds of dead were added to (
the steadily mounting Russian losses. |
Since the Russians unleashed the j
Lake Ladoga offensive, it is estima- |
ted here, they have suffered between
20,000 and 25,000 casualties, including
several thousand killed in battle
and many more wounded who froze
to death on the sub-zero battle fields |
before aid could be given them.
The Finns were described as fight
ing toward victory in their greatest 1
battle since the wiping out of the i
Red army's 142 nd and 63rd divisions
near Lake Marka at Suomussalmi j
during the holidays, and the fact that
they are crushing the superior num- i
hers of Russians thrown into the
Ladoga offensive has given them
fresh courage and vigor.
RUSSIAN THREAT
Nevertheless, the Russian threat
to swing down the northern and
western shores of Lake Ladoga to
strike at the Mannerheim Line from i
behind has not yet been eliminated i
completely, although every Finn be- ;
lieves tonight that the enemy's
chances of reassembling his shat- |
tered forces are slim indeed.
The Russian attacks are fewer and
weaker but they continue because a
complete debacle in this offensive
might compel the Russian command
to postpone, at least until early i
March when there is a break in the
weather, its plans for a break
through in this vital section.
