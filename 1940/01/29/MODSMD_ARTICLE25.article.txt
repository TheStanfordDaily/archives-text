# Stagging Pigs Run Berserk At Hawkins Jig
## 
### 
Farm women showed they could
j take it and turned out in large
numbers for last Saturday's Sadie 1
i Hawkins Dance. The campus went j
j wild, did what they've been wanting 1
to do for years—and the results fol- ,
j low.
Smartest idea of the evening was |
I pulled off by the Gammas Phis who i
j hired a hay wagon, with hay, and j
i used it to transport their dates to the ,
j dance. In the confusion, one male I
j rubbed lipstick all over a woman's!
j face without her discovering it. And
j she wondered why people snickered.;
A theater bigwig was shoved to j
and from the Women's Gym in a
wheelchair by a Row junior. Several i
women provided roller skates and
did it the hard way.
Two live pigs camn to the dance. ;
j Necessity forced their removal to 1
j the wide open spaces where they!
broke their halters and both eS
| caped. The white one ended up in ■
Encina where a few inmates began a j
tour, dropping the pig into bed with :
sleeping freshmen.
It seems everybody got wind of J
I the dance. Several San Francisco,
j medical students appeared, and the
I fever even spread to Mills women, j
j who dug up surprised males and
j drove them down to the Farm.
And one man laughed as the i
j waiter presented his date with a |
I check for $0.50.
