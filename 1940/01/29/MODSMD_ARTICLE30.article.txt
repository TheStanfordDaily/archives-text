## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Jan. 28 (UP).â€”
The Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee will begin immediate con
sideration of Japanese embargo
measures when it meets Wednesday,
Chairman Key Pittman, D., Nev.,
said tonight on his return from Sen.
William E. Borah's funeral at Boise,
Ida.

He said he sees nothing "critical"
in Japanese-American relations re
quiring hurried action, but that Sec
retary of State Cordell Hull, or some
other representative State Depart
ment official, will be asked to appear
before the committee and outline
developments since expiration of the
U.S.-Japanese treaty of commerce
last Friday.
