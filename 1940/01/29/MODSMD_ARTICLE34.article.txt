# Card Five Bows Twice To U.S.C.; 51-48, 53-37
## Double Victory Leaves Troy Loop Lenders 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Any doubts critics may have en
tertained that Sam Barry's Uni
versity of Southern California bas
ketball five isn't (lie logical claim
ant to the Southern Division
crown were thoroughly dispelled
at our Indians' expense this week
end.
The Trojans, a truly powerful
quintet which showed that it has
live lorwards of almost equal scor
ing ability on its line-up,
have virtually cleaned up on its con
ference opponents so far. The Cards
meet Santa Clara and St. Mary's
Friday and Saturday this week in
Kezar Pavilion in San Francisco.
To put it adequately, Coach Ev
erett Dean's outfit gave all it had
Friday night but come Saturday
night the club was tuckered out and
had to give way in what was not
their best basketball performance of
the season.
week-end scores
The week-end scores: U.S.C. 51,
Stanford 48; and U.S.C. .53, Stan
ford 37.
However, the Trojans are only the
logical claimants for the time being,
because they still have two games
to play with both the Berkeley
Bears and our Indians in the North,
and then we can't discount the re
vitalized Bruins who have Jackie
Robinson.
HEADACHES AHEAD
With the Indians still a dangerous
quintet despite two setbacks and
the comeback of the Golden Bears,
Sam Barry is going to have at least
Jour headaches next month when he
brings his club to the B;iy area.
Stanford's lone alibi for its double
defeat is that they didn't have the
services of one of its best players, j
Fordy Anderson, who was left '
home running a huge temperature. |
At least the Indians could have j
used him the first night when a .
three-point defeat was pretty hard j
to swallow, especially when our In- |
dians actually out-fieldgoaled the I
Trojans, 21-20.
SLOW START
In the first game, the Indians
started slowly and were led 26-20
at the half. They let the Trojans I

ond stanza, before Leon Lal'aille. Bob i
Penn, and Bill Cowden started)

but fouls called on Stanford in try
ing to get the ball away from the j
stalling Trojans gave S. C. two more [
points. To further control the sit- |
nation S.C. took only one of its two I
allotted charity tosses in both in- !
stances, putting the ball in play at
mid-court as allowed in (he new
rules.
WILLIAMS STOPPED
As expected, neither Ralph Vaughn 1
nor Don Williams scored many j
points. Kenny Davidson kept the '
league's highest scorer to 14 points j
in the two games—usually a good ;
evening's score for Vaughn. Tom ■
McGarvin had Williams even more
bottled up, holding him to nine
points—two in the first game.
Also, as was predicted that one of i
the other forwards or a guard would
lead the Trojan scoring, Jack Lip- i
pert, a guard, stole the scoring show
with 20 points Friday and .11 Sat- j
urday.

WILLIAMS STOPPED
As expected, neither Ralph Vaughn 1
nor Don Williams scored many j
points. Kenny Davidson kept the '
league's highest scorer to 14 points j
in the two games—usually a good ;
evening's score for Vaughn. Tom ■
McGarvin had Williams even more
bottled up, holding him to nine
points—two in the first game.
Also, as was predicted that one of i
the other forwards or a guard would
lead the Trojan scoring, Jack Lip- i
pert, a guard, stole the scoring show
with 20 points Friday and .11 Sat- j
urday.

The Trojans, a truly powerful
quintet which showed that it has

ing ability on its line-up,
have virtually cleaned up on its con
ference opponents so far. The Cards

Friday and Saturday this week in
Kezar Pavilion in San Francisco.

their best basketball performance of
the season.

The week-end scores: U.S.C. 51,

However, the Trojans are only the
logical claimants for the time being,
because they still have two games
to play with both the Berkeley
Bears and our Indians in the North,
and then we can't discount the re
vitalized Bruins who have Jackie
Robinson.

quintet despite two setbacks and
the comeback of the Golden Bears,
Sam Barry is going to have at least

brings his club to the B;iy area.
