# Papoose Basketballers Meet S.F. Polytechnic Wednesday
## 
### 
Eight days have elapsed since their
last contest, a victory over Palo
Alto High School, and the frosh bas
ketball ers are once again ready to
go to battleâ€”this time against Poly
technic High School in the Pavilion
Wednesday evening.
The coming week-end marks an
other open date for the Papoose cage
squad while they prepare for their
opening game of the annual three
game series with the Cal frosh. The
game will be played a week from
Friday at Berkeley as a preliminary
to the second game of the split
series between the Cal and Stanford
varsities.
POLY MAY PULL UPSET
Wednesday's contest with the Poly
High outfit should give the frosh
what they need in the way of com
petition before the all-important Cal
game. But Poly, with a team that
drubbed Commerce High 46 to 25
last week, is in a position to pull a
decided upset.
A little 110-pound package of dy
namite by the name of McCubbin
has shown himself to be the spark
plug of the Poly quintet by scoring
16 points in his last appearance. The
team's other high scorer is Mota,
McCubbin's running mate at for
ward, who is credited with the high
est point total in a single game in
the San Francisco prep loop this
season.
The Stanford freshman cagers now
appear in their best .shape since Ed
Voss came up with an ankle injury

I a few weeks ago. Voss took it easy
i all last week, and now looks as if
he will be able to play some ball
i again. The return of Voss will mean
additional height, an important fac
j tor on any basketball club. How
ever, Ed Stamm, who took Voss'
! spot, and did a good job of it, may
i be difficult to displace.
All other injuries or sicknesses
since the last games have been
j cleared up and today's and tomor-
I row's workouts should put the frosh
in shape for the Poly tilt.
