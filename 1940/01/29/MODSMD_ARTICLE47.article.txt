# Gloomy Sunday
## 
### 
OUTSIDE the window of this battered, old
Daily Shack, grimy with dust and silent
sentiment, the sky and the street are gray, and
even the trees and the grass seem to have some
grayness in them. This is the kind of day when
you shove away your typewriter with disgust
and mutter, "To hell with everything."
This is the kind of day when you slump back
in your chair moodily thinking, endeavoring
to form something concrete from the shadowy
train of long-range view parading past you. The
teletype machine is banging in the outside
office, and the kids on the staff are-hysterically
debating how much heat is generated from a
kiss.
In the midst of all this hubbub, your first
inclination is to dive into a reverie of self-analy
sis, pulling your ears in after you. But soon
you abandon the idea for fear of coming upon
an inadequacy or a maladjustment, and your
mind turns to its inevitable second choice, your
environment.
Stanford. Is it true what all these pessimists
are saying, these nostalgic seniors and dissatis
fied frosh? Is Stanford really on the down
grade?
Where Is Our Spirit?
No one can deny that school spirit is at a low
ebb. Some people claim that that sort of thing
is passe, that it disappeared with the advent of
the Depression and the decade of "grim reality."
But anyone who saw the Stanford stands go
mad over the Vowing Sophs and the Laughing
Boys knows that a vestige of the old spirit re
mained in the dirty thirties—at least on the days
when we had winning teams.
It takes victories to create emotion of that
kind. The little bit of it we tasted a week ago
last Friday night when the basketball team
trounced Cal conclusively proves that. Stream
ing out of the Pavilion, the rooters were grinning
and nudging their comrades and saying how
good it felt to win again.
Three years of losing football games and
changes and unrest in the coaching staff have
been disastrous for Stanford morale. They are
responsible for dragging school spirit down to
the cold, damp depths where it lies today.
However, this has happened before at other
universities, and they have recovered and risen
to the top of the cycle again. It isn't easy to
overcome the glooms, but they can be licked.
Almost 10 years ago California was lurking
in the sporting shadows, in the days when Nibs
Price was head football coach. One disastrous
season followed another, the alumni were
howling for his scalp, and the student body was
completely demoralized.
But Cal came back. In fact, it recovered so
completely that its supporters sometimes failed
to recognize where enthusiasm ends and hood
lumism begins.
The realization may be buried deep in the
back of our minds, but almost all of us realize
that as far as sports go Stanford teams and Stan
ford spirit soon will be on top again.
Going to the Dogs?
A great many of us, however, are thinking
about other things, more important than games,
things which the pessimists believe are bound
to be the Achilles' heels of Stanford.
To bring a privately endowed university
through the Depression years with its finances
unreduced and its brilliance undimmed is an
absolute impossibility—ask President Hutchins
of Chicago if it isn't. Considering the odds he
has been up against, painful reductions in in
terest of the University's bonds and once gen
erous alumni and benefactors pinching their
pocketbooks, President Wilbur has done an im
pressive job at Stanford.
Not only have we weathered the Depression
years, but we have come out of them in far
better financial shape than most similar insti
tutions. However, it was inevitable that salaries
should be cut down somewhat, that the staff
and facilities of the University should be slightly
reduced.
People complain about the number of build
ings that have been erected on the campus
during hard times, but they do not stop to
realize that one of these was in response to a
demand and financial aid of the Associated
Students, and the others were direct, earmarked
gifts that it would have been foolish to refuse.
Everywhere you hear students complaining
about the conservative attitude of the Adminis
tration. (And these columns are no exception
to the rule.) However, in comparison with other
universities, Stanford students are given more
free rein, more self-government, more voice in
the running of the school than almost anywhere
else.
Stanford University is far from perfect; any

sane person will grant that. But on the other
hand, it is not nearly as badly off as a great
many sour undergraduates point out. Com
plaints, after all, are chronic irritations which
come with winter guarter weather, too much
studying, and head colds.
And as I sit staring out the window, the gray
afternoon has become a blue-gray evening. Bud
Ames is standing on the curb waiting for some
one tcJ give him a ride home.
I still feel lousy, but Stanford is a pretty
damn good place after all.
