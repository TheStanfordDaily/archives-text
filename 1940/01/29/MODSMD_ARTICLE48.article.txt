NEW ANGLES FOIt KISSING
A SAN FRANCISCO physician, as everyone now
knows, said that kissing is a fine medication for
colds. And ever since, people have become imbued
with the spirit of medical science. It is amazing, the
number of willing Pasteurs and Florence Nightingales
we have developed all of a sudden.
Now kissing is a fairly archaic institution. History
has seldom if ever been devoid of mutual lip-massage,
and in pre-historic times, very likely, tfie Cromagnon
cave men kissed the Cromagnon women in the fire
shadows of their cozy caves. The Eskimos, it must be
confessed, rub noses, but who can be sure that they
don't kiss too in those sealed up igloos?
With so many centuries of practice behind the kiss,
it is rather disappointing that medicine failed to find
this new prophylactic value until 1940. But it just
goes to show that the most old-fashioned habits can
always develop a new angle. The modern automobile
has developed a lot of new kissing angles, I under
stand. But just as that source of originality was run
ning low, this new twist appeared in the oral horizon.
What I am picturing chiefly is the packed cold ward
in the hospital. I can see a coeducational row of wheel
chairs, occupied by patients using the self-help method
of cure. The nursing staff, of course, will have to be
enlarged a good deal to make up for the three-to-one
ratio—obviously unhealthful for the men.

DUT there is one bad factor that must be consid
ered: As colds are wiped off the face of the earth,
in an unheard-of epidemic of cure, people are going
to develop terrible cases of hypochondria. All Stan
ford will besiege the Men's and Women's Health Serv
ice, complaining of imaginary head-colds that demand
immediate attention.
Dating women, too, will probably be on the look
out for over-zealous humanitarians, burning with a
wish to cure colds. And no respectable young lady
will dare to be so blunt as to complain on the English
Corner, "I have a terrible cold!" She will have to con
fine herself to a demure blowing of the nose. That
will be ample to call forth plenty of side glances and
nudges—and phone calls. But engaged women whose
fiances are away had better keep extremely healthy.
There's many a cold between engagement and mar
riage.
In general this kissing-cure is going to involve a de
lightfully new set of customs. Campus cops might
start the social revolution by giving sneezers parking
permits.
Now remember, men, kissing is curative, but the
law will get you for petting.
I wonder what else this "famous physician" can
pull out of his hat?
