# CAMPUS OPINION
## THE
						CRUCIFIXION 
### 
nTHE EDITOR, SIR:
An innocent man was crucified on the Stanford
campus several days ago. You, Mr. Editor, wit
nessed and sanctioned that crime.
Bill Ellington got the dirtiest deal I can imagine,
and you, Sir, did not question it.
Your Slants writer acknowledged a lack of "prin
ciples and fairness"—to use his words—for which you,
Sir, had no regard.
Because you are interested in justice, I would like
to suggest that you discuss the problem of Mr. Elling
ton with those who know him best—his men on the
track squad.
I can assure you, Sir, that these trackmen are as
much interested in one man, as you say a certain man
is "interested in men."
Sincerely,
Bob Morton
P.S.: Possibly Mr. Ellington, too, is "interested in
men."
