# DON QUIXOTE RIDES A BULL
## 
### 
r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
Bull Sessioner Mellinkoff rode off in Wednesday
morning's column like Don Quixote to prevent the
"stabbing" of A.S.S.U. candidates through the use of
the preferential ballot. Maintaining a deliberately
moderate pace, he moved through the array of fruit
so temptingly employed as candidates, and pointed out
that "the preferential ballot gives voters the best pos
sible chance to stab candidates who look like good
men." It's the first time he's failed to see clearly the
whole of a topic (can't make this too rough, for I've
got to live with the guy) and I wouldn't have noticed
it if it hadn't been for his choice of names. I hate
prunes.
If your voter votes first for Mr. Lemon, second for
Mr. Prune, and last for Miss Peach, Mr. Mellinkoff
says he may be giving the young lady last choice in
order to favor Lemon. Knowing that Prune hasn't got
a chance, he believes that by his preference he has
put the girl in the cellar. The impression that prefer
ential ballot functions to that effect is held by a great
many voters, and I think it would be a good idea to
have the whole system carefully explained.
I ANDIDATES should be considered in preference
A according to which ones the voter would most like
to have in office. That is, Mr. Lemon, Miss Peach,
and last, Mr. Prune. Second and third choice votes
arc not counted until all the first choices have been
tallied. If a majority is not obtained by this initial
count, then the candidate whose first choice votes
were lowest is cast out, and the second choices on his
ballots are read as first choice and then added to the
the running. Thus, you sec, if Mr. Lemon, to whom
we gave first choice, has the lowest number of first
choice votes of the three candidates, he is auto
matically out of the race and our ballot is added to
the votes for Miss Peach.
You see, our preference didn't make a bit of dif
ference until our candidate had already lost. Our vote
has given Miss Peach the majority and she is elected
by virtue of the second choice votes. Now, Mr. Mel
linkoff, comes the reckoning. If you vote as you sav
so many do, giving second choice to TVTr. Prune over
Miss Peach even though you know her to be the bet
ter candidate, you have perhaps thrown the office to
Prune. How often this happens can be seen by the
number of candidates winning even though their first
choice votes were less than the winning candidate.
I stoutly maintain, in opposition to the Bull Ses
sion article on the subject, that the preferential ballot
is to be preserved.

so temptingly employed as candidates, and pointed out
that "the preferential ballot gives voters the best pos
sible chance to stab candidates who look like good
men." It's the first time he's failed to see clearly the
whole of a topic (can't make this too rough, for I've
got to live with the guy) and I wouldn't have noticed
it if it hadn't been for his choice of names. I hate
prunes.
If your voter votes first for Mr. Lemon, second for
Mr. Prune, and last for Miss Peach, Mr. Mellinkoff
says he may be giving the young lady last choice in
order to favor Lemon. Knowing that Prune hasn't got
a chance, he believes that by his preference he has
put the girl in the cellar. The impression that prefer
ential ballot functions to that effect is held by a great
many voters, and I think it would be a good idea to
have the whole system carefully explained.
I ANDIDATES should be considered in preference
A according to which ones the voter would most like
to have in office. That is, Mr. Lemon, Miss Peach,
and last, Mr. Prune. Second and third choice votes
arc not counted until all the first choices have been
tallied. If a majority is not obtained by this initial
count, then the candidate whose first choice votes
were lowest is cast out, and the second choices on his
ballots are read as first choice and then added to the
the running. Thus, you sec, if Mr. Lemon, to whom
we gave first choice, has the lowest number of first
choice votes of the three candidates, he is auto
matically out of the race and our ballot is added to
the votes for Miss Peach.
You see, our preference didn't make a bit of dif
ference until our candidate had already lost. Our vote
has given Miss Peach the majority and she is elected
by virtue of the second choice votes. Now, Mr. Mel
linkoff, comes the reckoning. If you vote as you sav
so many do, giving second choice to TVTr. Prune over
Miss Peach even though you know her to be the bet
ter candidate, you have perhaps thrown the office to
Prune. How often this happens can be seen by the
number of candidates winning even though their first
choice votes were less than the winning candidate.
I stoutly maintain, in opposition to the Bull Ses
sion article on the subject, that the preferential ballot
is to be preserved.
