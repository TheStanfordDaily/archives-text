# 'Earl of Chicago' Proves Montgomery A-Plus Actor
## 
### 
"Earl »f Chicago," now playing at
the Varsity.
A couple of years ago, M.G.M.
bought the movie rights to an Eng
lish play called "Night Must Fall."
Robert Montgomery, against the ad
vice of the metromoguls, played,
and played magnificently, the part
of a psychopathic killer.
Well, either because movie-men
hate to admit a man's an actor in
stead of a witty, well-dressed cream
puff, or because they don't know an
actor when they see one, Robert
Montgomery was sent right back to
his usual well-tailored roles.
Apparently Montgomery, after a
suitable interim, tried again to prove
he was an actor; and he's good—so
good, that we are once again filled
with rage at a Hollywood which
searches even unto the far reaches
of Outer Mongolia for an ACTOR
"Earl of Chicago" has a simple
plot; it's the story of a Chicago
hoodlum who succeeds to a great
English title. But it's not in the
plot that the strength of the thing

J lies. Montgomery brings to his por
trayal of Silky a vivid understanding
of the psychological twists of his
pathetic and difficult character,
i To show by a look or a gesture the
! innate breeding existing at the core
J of a hard, near-illiterate, raw-nerved
! gangster, is a job of acting no
I glamour boy could have done, with
l out making the character a" sort of
j under-privileged Little Lord Faunt
i leroy. In this movie, a superb sup
! porting cast can do no more than
serve as a yardstick by which Mont
gomery's acting stature may be
measured.—Nowell
