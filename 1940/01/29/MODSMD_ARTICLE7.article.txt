# Research Shows Ample War Grain

At the outset of the present war,
European countries are in a far bet
ter position than in 1914 to hold
down their essential requirements
for overseas wheat, according to a
study completed recently by the
Stanford University Food Research
Institute.
"Recurrence of a world wheat
stringency like that of 1917-18 seems
improbable for at least two years
and possibly three, and would prob
ably not occur later except in the
event of abnormally low yields per
acre in the overseas exporting coun
tries," stated Dr. Merrill K. Bennett,
author of the study.
"There is little likelihood," he said,
"of German wheat production de
clining more than 20 per cent or 25
per cent, whereas it dropped 40 per
cent in the last war."
