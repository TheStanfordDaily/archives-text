### 
Edward C. Lipman, consulting pro
fessor of the Graduate School of
Business and vice-president and
managing director of the Emporium,
will speak on "merchandising" to
night at the third of the Men's Voca
tional Guidance Series at Encina
Hall.
Mr. Lipman's talk will take the
form of a combination lecture and
consultation. He will speak extem
poraneously for about 45 minutes,
leaving a quarter of an hour for
members of the audience to ask
questions. His talk is Ihe second of
a "series within a series," which was
inaugurated last week by Dean
Jackson of the business school.
ALL MEN WELCOME
Assistant Dean of Men Stanley L.
Sharp, who is directing the series,
emphasized that the talk will last
only one hour, from 7 to 8, and that
all men students of the university
are welcome. The talks are being
held in Encina Hall so that they
will be especially accessible to
freshmen and sophomores.
The series is an attempt on the
part of the Dean of Men's office to
give men students a chance to get
"inside dope" on various professions
and business opportunities. A spe
cial effort has been made this year
to bring in speakers who have had
practical experience in their various
fields.
