### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
r pHE Russians and the Finns have
been fighting for two months
now. And the Soviets hold, today,
considerably less Finnish territory
than they held four weeks ago.
With a stubbornness and mili
tary skill that has amazed the
world, the Finns have been driv
ing the Russians back—even across
their own boundary at several
points—and inflicting a toll of
casualties that some estimates
place at well above 100,000.
* * *
Where they've been able to dig a
foothold on Finnish soil, the Rus
sians have built fortifications and
are waging a defensive war for the
most part in an effort to hold their
gains. Everywhere, except possibly
on the northern front where forces
are small, the Russian losses have
been tremendous in proportion to
the number of troops involved and
particularly in comparison to the far
out-numbered Finns. The north has
been quiet; only on the Karelian
Isthmus and northeast of Lake La
doga have wave after wave of red
infantry been hurled against the
Finnish lines.
The last month has been one of
a series of failures for the Soviets.
Since these rebuffs, they've begun
to dig in at the spots where they
were halted—or behind them. At
some places, such as Salla, a line
of Russian fortifications has been
abandoned in favor of a line closer
to the border, easier to defend and
assuring better protection of com
munication lines.

r J I HE change from an offensive to
a "positional" warfare in the
north is the reason for the com
parative calm above the Arctic cir
cle and directly south of it follow
ing the Russian debacle at Suomu
salmi. The main question occupy
ing the attention of the Finnish com
manders now Ls whether or not the
Russians will start a new offensive—
and when—now that their offensive
northeast of Lake Ladoga appeal's to
have been shattered after nine days
of assaults that claimed probably
25,000 Red Army deaths. There are
strong reports from Finland that new
Soviet divisions are arriving on the
Salla front, perhaps for another at
tempt to drive across Finland at
their narrow waistline and reach the
Gulf of Bothnia to cut Finland in
half.
If a drive such as this were suc
cessful. it would go a long way
toward stopping war materials
and volunteers pouring into Fin
land each day and might be of
tremendous aid to the Russian di
visions stalled on the Karelian
Isthmus before the Mannerheim
Line and north of Lake Ladoga.
If you're going to make any bets
on the international situation,
though, it would be smart not to
count on any new Russian of
fensive until spring.

of a spring campaign over a win
ter one have been argued fre
quently, but without conclusion. In
summer the Russians, most people
think, would certainly be able to
make every use of the long day
light and attack for hours on end,
on land and in the air. Warmer
weather would enable the Russians
to remain in the open for 24 hours
a day without freezing to death, such
as they do now.

They might be able to turn the

There are reports even now that
the Russians are contemplating send
ing these mounted cossack troops
against their enemy, but reports of
Russian intentions are plentiful

If the world were to anticipate
every Russian move, the world would
be plenty busy. And the Russians
would be busy, too. Right now,

they've got their hands full.

salmi. The main question occupy
ing the attention of the Finnish com
manders now Ls whether or not the
Russians will start a new offensive—
and when—now that their offensive
northeast of Lake Ladoga appeal's to
have been shattered after nine days
of assaults that claimed probably
25,000 Red Army deaths. There are
strong reports from Finland that new
Soviet divisions are arriving on the
Salla front, perhaps for another at
tempt to drive across Finland at
their narrow waistline and reach the
Gulf of Bothnia to cut Finland in
half.
If a drive such as this were suc
cessful. it would go a long way
toward stopping war materials
and volunteers pouring into Fin
land each day and might be of
tremendous aid to the Russian di
visions stalled on the Karelian
Isthmus before the Mannerheim
Line and north of Lake Ladoga.
If you're going to make any bets
on the international situation,
though, it would be smart not to
count on any new Russian of
fensive until spring.

r J' , HE advantages and disadvantages
of a spring campaign over a win
ter one have been argued fre
quently, but without conclusion. In
summer the Russians, most people
think, would certainly be able to
make every use of the long day
light and attack for hours on end,
on land and in the air. Warmer
weather would enable the Russians
to remain in the open for 24 hours
a day without freezing to death, such
as they do now.

They might be able to turn the
tables on the now more mobile
Finnish forces—if tliey could find
the proper terrain for it — by
sending tens of thousands of cos
sack cavalrymen against the
Finns.

There are reports even now that
the Russians are contemplating send
ing these mounted cossack troops
against their enemy, but reports of
Russian intentions are plentiful
these days.
If the world were to anticipate
every Russian move, the world would
be plenty busy. And the Russians
would be busy, too. Right now,
though, cossacks or no cossacks,
they've got their hands full.
