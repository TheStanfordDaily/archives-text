# MRS. ALLEN NURSES 'ROUGHS'
## 'My Boys' Idols Of Men's Rest Home Director 
### BUD AMES 
"The Mother of All Men West of
the Mississippi" is the self-assumed
title of Mrs. Clifford G. Allen, head
lady of the Stanford Men's Rest
Home over on Alvarado Road.
"It might even go farther than
that because I've certainly had
men in this homo from all over the
globe,"she laughed. "About 1,900
of them in all since I took over this
job about four years ago. I'm just
loony about my work here at the
home."
USES PSYCHOLOGY
And a home it is—Mr. and Mrs.
Allen built it here about 25 years
ago. She graduated from Stanford
in 1912. After her husband's death
four years ago, Mrs. Allen turned it
into a place where sick Stanford
boys could go.
"When one of the boys comes
into my home, I treat him just like
he is coming on a visit," Mrs. Allen
explained. "Of course I don't tell
them right, out, but they understand.
And they never abuse the privileges
of my home, not even with the ra
dios that they bring in.
"And I don't mind the boys who
are well enough having calls from
women. There comes a time when a
woman's call will do a fellow a lot
more good than a game of pinochle."
WORK 'NATURAL'
Mrs. Allen took over her present
task four years ago because, as she
put it, she "needed to be needed."
For the 12 preceding years she had
kept constant vigil at the bedside of
her husband, Stanford's late Pro
fessor Allen, stricken with sleeping
sickness. The Rest Home was a nat
ural step forward.
A staunch Stanfordite, Mrs. Allen
sent her son John to the Stanford
Business School, and her second
son. Bob, will graduate from the
Farm this spring.
Her strongest attribute seems to
be her ability to get along with men,
whom she calls collectively "my
boys." Stanford men she considers
as "swell, considerate, and cour
teous."
GIRLS ARE NICE'
'"I remember once when on of my
boys whistled at me down in Palo
Alto and yelled, 'Hey, Mother Su
perior.' I liked it, but one of my
friends thought it was disrespectful,"
she said with another laugh.
"Of course I think girls are nice,
too, but only if they are nice to my
boys."
With regard to The Daily's recent
article on osculation as a means of
killing germs, Mrs. Allen also had
definite opinions.
"Scientifically, I don't know
whether or not a kiss will kill
germs," she said. "But I think cer
tain kisses are worth a chance even
if they do spread germs."
FISH HOBBYIST
A telephone broke off her good
natured chatting. It must, have been

' the fifth time—her telephone is al
ways ringing. And she doesn't waste
words over the wires. A couple of
"O.K.'s," a quick "what's his tem
perature," and then she hangs up.
Raising tropical fish is one of her
; hobbies. At one time she had 14
stocked tanks, but now she has nar
rowed her interests to one tank in
the living room. Her two dogs are
t her second prides—especially Deuce,
who will climb a tree at her com
mand.
"But I'd rather raise boys," she
stated. "It's a much better invest
j ment."

job about four years ago. I'm just
loony about my work here at the

USES PSYCHOLOGY
And a home it is—Mr. and Mrs.
Allen built it here about 25 years
ago. She graduated from Stanford
in 1912. After her husband's death
four years ago, Mrs. Allen turned it
into a place where sick Stanford
boys could go.
"When one of the boys comes
into my home, I treat him just like
he is coming on a visit," Mrs. Allen
explained. "Of course I don't tell
them right, out, but they understand.
And they never abuse the privileges
of my home, not even with the ra
dios that they bring in.
"And I don't mind the boys who
are well enough having calls from
women. There comes a time when a
woman's call will do a fellow a lot
more good than a game of pinochle."
WORK 'NATURAL'
Mrs. Allen took over her present
task four years ago because, as she
put it, she "needed to be needed."
For the 12 preceding years she had
kept constant vigil at the bedside of
her husband, Stanford's late Pro
fessor Allen, stricken with sleeping
sickness. The Rest Home was a nat
ural step forward.
A staunch Stanfordite, Mrs. Allen
sent her son John to the Stanford
Business School, and her second
son. Bob, will graduate from the
Farm this spring.
Her strongest attribute seems to
be her ability to get along with men,
whom she calls collectively "my
boys." Stanford men she considers
as "swell, considerate, and cour
teous."
GIRLS ARE NICE'
'"I remember once when on of my
boys whistled at me down in Palo
Alto and yelled, 'Hey, Mother Su
perior.' I liked it, but one of my
friends thought it was disrespectful,"
she said with another laugh.
"Of course I think girls are nice,
too, but only if they are nice to my
boys."
With regard to The Daily's recent
article on osculation as a means of
killing germs, Mrs. Allen also had
definite opinions.
"Scientifically, I don't know
whether or not a kiss will kill
germs," she said. "But I think cer
tain kisses are worth a chance even
if they do spread germs."

A telephone broke off her good

words over the wires. A couple of

Raising tropical fish is one of her
; hobbies. At one time she had 14
stocked tanks, but now she has nar

"The Mother of All Men West of
