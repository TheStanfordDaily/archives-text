# 'Dimes March' Reaches Climax Here Tomorrow
## Branner, Theta Chi, A.T.O. Reach 'Honor List' for Polio Drive 
### 
Tomorrow's the last day to "join
the 4()0."
With two more living groups added
to its "honor list" and contributions
mounting by the hour, the Stanford
"March of Dimes" drive enters its
last two days today.
The drive, which is being con
ducted on the Farm by Alpha Phi
Omega, national service fraternity, is
a result of a nation-wide appeal by
President Roosevelt for funds with
which to fight infantile paralysis.
The money collected is divided pro
portionately among the national in
stitution at Warm Springs, Ga., and
various colleges and universities
which conduct research for means of
curing the disease.
HONOR LIST' NAMED
Branner Hall, Alpha Tau Omega,
and Theta Chi are the only campus
living groups to reach the goal of "a
dime from each resident," the requi
site for honor list standing. Bran
ner, where the Stanford drive origi
nated, made it early last week, and
A.T.O. and Theta Chi reported their
limit reached yesterday morning.
The A.P.O. has divided the cam
pus into ten districts, each in charge
of an A.P.O. pledge. Letters have
also been sent to the heads of 59 liv
ing groups, explaining to them the
purpose of the drive, and requesting
them to appoint reliable men as col
lectors for their respective groups.
$400 GOAL
A giant thermometer has been set
up in front of the Libo, but because
many of the dimes contributed have
not yet been taken from the col
lecting cans and counted, the "mer
cury" is far below the actual mark,
according to Jim Thurmond, pub
licity director of the drive. "Join the
400" signs have been displayed at
prominent places on the campus,
and in large halls such as Encina
men have been appointed to cover
each corridor.
Thurmond pointed out that if the
goal of $400 is to be reached by to
morrow night, an average of a dime
from each University student must
be collected. "We'll have to go some
to make that!" he said.

morrow night, an average of a dime
from each University student must
be collected. "We'll have to go some
to make that!" he said.
Tomorrow's the last day to "join
the 4()0."
With two more living groups added
to its "honor list" and contributions
mounting by the hour, the Stanford
"March of Dimes" drive enters its
last two days today.
The drive, which is being con
ducted on the Farm by Alpha Phi
Omega, national service fraternity, is
a result of a nation-wide appeal by
President Roosevelt for funds with
which to fight infantile paralysis.
The money collected is divided pro
portionately among the national in
stitution at Warm Springs, Ga., and
various colleges and universities
which conduct research for means of
curing the disease.
HONOR LIST' NAMED
Branner Hall, Alpha Tau Omega,
and Theta Chi are the only campus
living groups to reach the goal of "a
dime from each resident," the requi
site for honor list standing. Bran
ner, where the Stanford drive origi
nated, made it early last week, and
A.T.O. and Theta Chi reported their
limit reached yesterday morning.
The A.P.O. has divided the cam
pus into ten districts, each in charge
of an A.P.O. pledge. Letters have
also been sent to the heads of 59 liv
ing groups, explaining to them the
purpose of the drive, and requesting
them to appoint reliable men as col
lectors for their respective groups.
$400 GOAL
A giant thermometer has been set
up in front of the Libo, but because
many of the dimes contributed have
not yet been taken from the col
lecting cans and counted, the "mer
cury" is far below the actual mark,
according to Jim Thurmond, pub
licity director of the drive. "Join the
400" signs have been displayed at
prominent places on the campus,
and in large halls such as Encina
men have been appointed to cover
each corridor.
Thurmond pointed out that if the
goal of $400 is to be reached by to
morrow night, an average of a dime
from each University student must
be collected. "We'll have to go some
to make that!" he said.
