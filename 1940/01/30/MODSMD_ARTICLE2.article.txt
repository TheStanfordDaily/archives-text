### 
HELSINKI, Jan. 29 (UP). â€”Rus-
sian bombing planes today swept
across southern Finland in bomb
ing and machine - gunning attacks
that killed about 55 persons and
wounded 60 others in what Finns
called brutal revenge for the smash
ing of a nine-day Russian offensive
northeast of Lake Ladoga.
Tonight's military communique
said that in a day of fierce fighting
on the Ladoga front 1,250 Russians
were slaughtered and several enemy
"strong points" captured.
Finnish sources estimated that the
offensive has cost the enemy 25,000
to 27,000 casualties, including about
9,500 dead, without seizing a foot of
ground for a flanking assault on the
Mannerheim Line.
SOVIET PLANES DOWNED
Ten Russian planes were shot
down during today's terrorizing air
raids which were the worst since the
first few days of the war, it was an
nounced officially.
Three of the Red bombers were
brought down at the southern port
of Aabo (Turku) where 30 persons
were killed and 50 wounded when
10 Russian planes dropped explosive
and incendiary bombs that set fire
to many buildings.
Russian planes bombed a Red
Cross military hospital behind the
Finnish lines on the Karelian Isth
mus, killing 23 of the 30 persons
there, which included wounded sol
diers trapped in their beds as flames
devoured the structure. Four women
perished.
HOSPITALS HIT
Hospitals, churches, an ambu
lance train and a funeral procession
were the targets of the air raiders
sweeping across the Gulf of Finland
from Russia's newly-acquired Es
tonian air bases, it was stated.
Four times the Russian bombers
tried to reach Helsinki during the
day but each time they were driven
off by anti-aircraft fire and one
Russian bomber was shot down on
the outskirts.
Finland's air raids precautions
chief, Genei'al Aarne Sihvo, alleged
tonight, that the Russian fliers are
using explosive bullets in their ma
chine-guns in ''strafing" fleeing
civilians.
i(> CITIES ATTACKED
He said the reports had been re
ceived "the murder of Finnish civil
ians had caused great pleasure among
the Moscow leaders" who have
hailed these attacks as victories.
"It is stupid to believe," Gen.
Sihvo said, "that, such brutal acts
could break the unanimous will of
(he Finnish people to defend them
selves."
Gen. Sihvo's report on last week's
air raids said that. Russian planes
attacked 46 cities, towns and com
munities, killing 24 civilians and
wounding 56.
