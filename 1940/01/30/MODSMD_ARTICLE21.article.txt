### 
Kccau.sc of the recent startling increase in trallic accidents and speeding
offenses, Men's Council yesterday took action to make Stanford road* wafer
for pedestrians and autoists.
Hereafter, according to Chairman Rob Putnam, all campus offenders
who are brought up before the Council three times on speeding or recklew.

> driving charges will be forbidden the
t use of their cars on the campus for
any period deemed necessary by the
Council duo to the seriousness of
the offenses.
This provision can be enforced
through the fact that the Stanford
campus is private property and
right to pass over the roads thereon
may be revoked by the owners at
any time.
PRORATION PLANNED
Students who at the present time
have two offenses against their rec
ord will be placed on probation,
stated Council spokesmen. Other
business considered at the meeting
included fining of students who
"still insist on parking in the Edu
cation Building parking lot."
Chairman Putnam emphasized his
former warning that campus offi
cers will strictly enforce the provi
sion that this parking area will be
reserved for faculty cars only.
FIGURES RELEASED
Campus traffic violations are re
ported by the following figures re
leased by the accounting department
for the University year 1938-39:
Speeding tickets 113
Parking tickets 357
Total lines collected $748
Putnam stated that "students are
beginning to have the opinion that
Men's Council is just an easy for
mality to hurdle and has no regu
latory power. We have adopted the
plan of limiting the number of of
fenses to three in an attempt to
curb the overly large number of
offenses against campus automo
bile regulations."
