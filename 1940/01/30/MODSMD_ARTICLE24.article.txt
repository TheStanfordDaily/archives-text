# Hanya Holm Applauded At Recital
## Small, Enthusiastic Audience Acclaims Good Performance 
### ROSEMARIE MULLANY 
There is just one compensation to
an artist for a semi-filled house.
Ilanya Holm, ,who instructed a class
in modern dance at Stanford for a
short time last year, and her com
pany received that compensation in
full last Sunday night at the Curran
Theater in San Francisco when a
scattered hut intensely interested
audience applauded the perform
ance longly and as loudly as its num
bers allowed.
Miss Holm accepted the tribute
with such unaffected pleasure that
one almost expected to see her step
off the stage and shake hands with
each member of the audience. Her
attitude and that of her group is
one of sharing with, not giving to,
the audience.
DANCE THEMES HARD
Regrettably, everyone Sunday
liight was unable to share complete
ly with Miss Holm some parts of
her program. There were times
when the theme of the dances was
}>oyond the grasp of one only gen
erally familiar with choreographic
interpretations. It was far from un
pleasant, however, at such interludes
to concentrate on the purely techni
cal aspect of the dancing.
In all modern dance there is an
expression of free movement sea
soned with purposiveness and bal
ance. Miss Holm's technique not
only embodies these fundamentals
but intensifies them. Musical ac
companiment suggests rhythms that
the dancers amplify with precise,
frequently complex movement.
lIOIJVI IS AUTHOR
Choreography for the entire pro
gram was composed by Miss Holm.
She is obviously unshackled by
standard notions of symmetry in
these designs, hcnce imbues the pat
terns with the essential spirit of
modern danceâ€”free, yet directed,
movement.
One final word of praise is cer
tainly deserved by Miss Henrietta
Greenhood, a member of the group,
who, whether from consistent skill
or inspirational flash, contributed
outstandingly to an already excel
lent recital.
