# Card Cage Squad Rests After Battle With Troy
## Dean Schedules Light Workouts For This Week 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Bruised and battered from their
two stormy Trojan basketball
games, the ndlians were given free
rein yesterday by Coach Everelt
Dean even though the cagers have
two tough 'uns'Friday and Satur
day in San Francisco's Kezar Pa
vilion.
Id fact there won't be a lot of prep
aration by Dean for the Santa Clara
and St. Mary's games, for he has
decided to let the boys off Thurs
day also and has scheduled only
light, workouts for this afternoon
find tomorrow.
lIFAVY DRILLING DROPPED
Dean figures that his men will be
in much finer fettle this week-end
without a lot of heavy work than
â– they would be if he ran them
through heavy drills right on top of
the rough-and-tumble tilts in Los
Angeles.
While Stanford wasn't quite the
team to stop the Trojans' long win
ning streak, the team members think
that they've salvaged something
from the two games. And that is
Hank Luisetti's all-time scoring
record of 234 points in Southern
Division play.
Thanks to Co-Capt. Ken David
son, Ralph Vaughn, who was sup
posedly the man to turn the trick,
hung up only 14 points and in
creased his total to 64 points for the
season. It will take a "superman's"
effort to ring up an average of bet
ter than 24 points in his next seven
games to top Luisetti's "high."
SFARS' SCORE HIGHER
With Cal and U.C.L.A. idle until
this week-end when they play at
Berkeley, Stanford and U.S.C. play
ers virtually monopolized the first
10 in scoring, as compiled by Don
Liebendorfer. Dale Sears of Troy
has 55 points, a jump from fourth
place.
Don Williams of Stanford is still
in third place with 54 points, but
leads in the number of field goals
with 23 to Vaughn's 22. Jackie Rob
inson of Ucla, who with any sort of
basketball shooting this week
should usurp Vaughn's place, is
fourth with 48 points.
Ken Davidson has 45 points, Cow
den has 35, and Dick Taylor has 33,
thus placing all Stanford varsity
men except Fordy Anderson on the
high scoring list. Anderson, who
was left home last week-end, will
not be used this week against the
Broncos or Gaels, according to Dean,
who wants his ace to be in top shape
for .second Cal game, Feb. 9.
