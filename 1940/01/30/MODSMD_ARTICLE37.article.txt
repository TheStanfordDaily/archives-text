## JERRY MAYER, Sports Editor Frosh Hoopsters Prepare For Polytechnic Tussle 
### DON SELBY 
Getting together for the first time since last Thursday, the frosh basket
ball team yesterday put in a still' practice session in preparation for their
game wtih Polytechnic High School of San Francisco in the Pavilion to
morrow night at o'clock.
This coming week-end's open date has been partially filled by a game

with Piedmont High School, which,
will be played in the Pavilion at
7:30 o'clock Saturday night. The
Friday night date was left open in
order that the frosh players might
see the Stanford-Santa Clara game
in San Francisco on that night.
VOSS' ANKLE WEAK
Although Ed Voss, who injured his
ankle in practice a few weeks ago,
has returned, the layoff may have
hampered his condition, in which
case it may be several days before
he will be ready to go at top speed
again.
When Voss gets back in condition
Coach H. B. Lee declares that he
may use both Voss and Ed Stamm,
who took over Voss' spot when the
latter was injured, at the same time,
thus fielding a team with more
height. In all probability this will
mean more rebound ability.
POLY RATED HIGH
In Beeb Lee's estimation Poly has
just reached its peak, as evidenced
by their lop-sided victory over
Commerce High last week, and, al
though the Poly outfit isn't very tall,
it is exceedingly fast. With tiny
McCubbin as the spearhead, the Me
chanics feature a last break which
may prove troublesome.
Although he is not sure of it, Lee
believes that he will have Walt
Funabiki guard McCubbin while
Jim McCaffrey will be assigned to
Mota, Poly's other outstanding
eager, who leads the S. F. prep loop
in scoring so far this season.
