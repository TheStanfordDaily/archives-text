# Janss Regains Top Ski Rating
## Blackburn Fractures Leg at Badger Pass 
### 
I With Bill Janss regaining his top
; ranking, final ski team tryouts were
j held Sunday at Badger Pass to de-
I termine Stanford's representatives
jin the Reno meet. Janss, whose
times at Sun Valley were bettered
by both Bud McDufne and Phil
Clayburgh, clinched his old number
one spot with the top slalom per
formance.
Sheets of ice from Friday night's
rain made conditions on the slopes
very bad resulting in several spec
tacular spills, one of which was a
! severe blow to the ski team. Jack
j Blackburn broke his leg when he
caught a .ski edge at a high speed.
| Blackburn, who spent last winter
i in the Austrian Tyrol, would have
i been one of the outstanding men on
j the team.
McDuffie copped the number two
position on the team and was pre
! vented from equaling Janss' time by
several unlucky crack-ups. Clay-
I burgh, despite the longest spill of
I the day, finished third with Jack
j Ditz fourth.
Paul Nau, a jumper from Oregon,
is liable to furnish a surprise in the
meet this week-end. Others who
' earned places on the squad are
| Chris Sontum, Eilest Stoeren, Bob
I Shiner, Dave Nottage, Stan Vander
i burgh, Dave Welch. Barney Fergu
j son, Bob Warren, and Gerson Gold
smith.
