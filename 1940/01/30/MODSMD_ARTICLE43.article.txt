# El Toro Whips Sigma Nu, 26-2, On Hardwood
## Encina 1W Spurts During Second Half To Beat 3W Squad 
### 
Encina 1W, after sleeping for a
half, pulled itself out of the doldrums
and put on a second half spurt
that handed them a 21-16 victory
over their arch rivals, Encina 3W.
Bob Kennedy led the winners in
the delayed drive by scoring a total
of 8 points, all in the second half, to
lead in the scoring. The losers were
lead by David Doud, who played a
stellar floor game and managed to
make 4 points.
The red-shirted El Toro five look
ed very impressive in handing a
weak Sigma Nu II outfit a 26-2
thumping. Bob Morton at forward
topped the scoring with 10 points.
