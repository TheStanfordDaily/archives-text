### JERRY MAYER 
THOSE POWERFUL BRUINS
TERRORS OF THE COAST
Recent announcement that U. C.
L. A. has abandoned rugby brings
to mind the pitiable plight oi the
Bruins, athletically speaking. After
the last football season the West
wood school was riding on top of
the world. It had attained national
recognition, the team had gone un
defeated although tied four times,
and the Bruins were co-champions
: of the Pacific Coast Conference.
But the next football season is a
whole year off, and in between come
j several sports in which U.C.L.A. fig
ures to take it on the chin again—
just as it has ever since the school
j entered the Pacific Coast Conference
j in 1928.
Look at the Bruin basketball
team, for instance. It hasn't won a
league game since and has a
losing streak that has extended
through the Uclans' last 2!) south
ern division games.
In track the hapless southern-
I ers often suffer the ignominy of
: opposing teams scoring 100 points
against them, and even many of
the small colleges in Southern
California «*m give them an even
tussle. Last year at the Fresno Re
lays, U.C.L.A. was the butt of nu
merous jests because it was out
' scored by George Pepperdine Col
lege. a liny denominational school
in Los Angeles that is only a
couple of years old and has hut
a handful of students.
In past seasons the Uclans have
had some good baseball teams but
a few years ago most of the campus
jobs allotted to the horse-hiders
I were taken away, and since then the

Bruins have become a doormat in
that sport.
The Wcstwooders usually have an
adequate tennis team, but it has
been several years since they have
contended for the net champion
ship.
* * *
Stanford's soccer outfit traveled*
south to meet the southern booteijs
last quarter, and dumped them by a
10-1 score, meanwhile using every
substitute v/ho made the trip. While
Coach Harry Maloney had one of
I his best teams in recent years they
I couldn't handle even the local
i jaysees as easily as they dud the
| Bruins.
VJ.C.L.A.'s golf team lives up to
the record of the other sports, with
most of its members shooting
j higher scores than some of Stan
ford's intramural divolmen.
In polo, the Bruins looked around
I for enough men to make up a four
! man team, and finally had to find a
I girl to round out the quartet.
; Last autumn U.C.L.A. suffered
j the humiliation of having to dis
j continue its freshman football

Recent announcement that U. C.
L. A. has abandoned rugby brings
to mind the pitiable plight oi the
Bruins, athletically speaking. After
the last football season the West
wood school was riding on top of
the world. It had attained national
recognition, the team had gone un
defeated although tied four times,
and the Bruins were co-champions
: of the Pacific Coast Conference.
But the next football season is a
whole year off, and in between come
j several sports in which U.C.L.A. fig
ures to take it on the chin again—
just as it has ever since the school
j entered the Pacific Coast Conference
j in 1928.
Look at the Bruin basketball
team, for instance. It hasn't won a
league game since and has a
