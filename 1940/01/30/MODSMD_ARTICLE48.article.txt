# Three Strikes and You're Out

\\T TIT their pocketbooks, and they will re-
J_ J. member the law," has long been the
motto of Men's Council in dealing with traffic
violations on the campus.
However, it seems that in this year of grace,
1940, the purses of Stanford speeders are so
well lined that fines have ceased to make very
deep impressions. The 135 speeding tags dis
tributed two years ago were reduced to 113 last
year, but already the '39-'4O total appears to
be on the up-grade.
Unable to cope with the situation with fiscal
penalties, Men's Council yesterday declared its
intention of using more direct methods to stamp
out illegally fast driving on the campus. Any
one who receives three tags for speeding or
reckless driving will be forbidden to drive his
car on the campus for a period to be determined
by the Council according to the enormity of the
offense. ,
To some this penalty may seem rather diffi
cult to enforce. But the Stanford campus is pri
vate property, and the University, or the student
government to which it has given its mandate,
can keep anyone it wants to from using its
roads. Violations of the orders of the Council
will be treated as breaches of the Honor Code.
To others this punishment may seem a little
stringent. However, with a constantly diminish
ing ratio of more than one car to every three
students, keeping Stanford free from traffic ac
cidents is an enormous task. The first time that
someone is killed or seriously injured in a
campus crack-up, Men's Council will get its
share of the blame.
Therefore, if fines have no effect on the local
playboys and their flashy convertibles, some
other cure must be devised. At least on paper,
depriving third-time offenders of their cars
seems to be an extremely practical method.
Stanford students are good drivers, but they
are too often careless and unthinking at the
wheel. And they always are in a hurry.
The recent string of off-campus accidents
shows quite clearly where a potential danger
lies.
If the baby won't stop chewing his rattle,
Men's Council will have to take it away.

tributed two years ago were reduced to 113 last
year, but already the '39-'4O total appears to
be on the up-grade.
Unable to cope with the situation with fiscal
penalties, Men's Council yesterday declared its
intention of using more direct methods to stamp
out illegally fast driving on the campus. Any
one who receives three tags for speeding or
reckless driving will be forbidden to drive his
car on the campus for a period to be determined
by the Council according to the enormity of the
offense. ,
To some this penalty may seem rather diffi
cult to enforce. But the Stanford campus is pri
vate property, and the University, or the student
government to which it has given its mandate,
can keep anyone it wants to from using its
roads. Violations of the orders of the Council
will be treated as breaches of the Honor Code.
To others this punishment may seem a little
stringent. However, with a constantly diminish
ing ratio of more than one car to every three
students, keeping Stanford free from traffic ac
cidents is an enormous task. The first time that
someone is killed or seriously injured in a
campus crack-up, Men's Council will get its
share of the blame.
Therefore, if fines have no effect on the local
playboys and their flashy convertibles, some
other cure must be devised. At least on paper,
depriving third-time offenders of their cars
seems to be an extremely practical method.
Stanford students are good drivers, but they
are too often careless and unthinking at the
wheel. And they always are in a hurry.
The recent string of off-campus accidents
shows quite clearly where a potential danger
lies.
If the baby won't stop chewing his rattle,
Men's Council will have to take it away.
\\T TIT their pocketbooks, and they will re-
J_ J. member the law," has long been the
motto of Men's Council in dealing with traffic
violations on the campus.
However, it seems that in this year of grace,
1940, the purses of Stanford speeders are so
well lined that fines have ceased to make very
deep impressions. The 135 speeding tags dis
tributed two years ago were reduced to 113 last
year, but already the '39-'4O total appears to
be on the up-grade.
