# A
						Dime to the Good

BECAUSE the cost of attending Stanford is
high, students are prone to complain every
time that they are asked to contribute to some
worthy cause. Everywhere campaigners hear
the cry, "First it's the Red Cross, then it's the
Convalescent Home, and then it's something
else!"
While there is more than a grain of truth in
this, Stanford students would be wise to give
fair consideration to how much they are re
guested to give and how great a need exists
before they moan about being bled.
This week the local chapter of Alpha Phi
Omega, a national service fraternity, is asking
everyone on the campus to give a dime—two
cokes, two-thirds of a pack of cigarettes—to aid
research for the prevention and cure of infantile
paralysis.
The sum is one that every student can afford,
and the need is apparent to any person who is
acguainted with a polio victim or who knows
the work that is being done at Warm Springs.
For those who may be skeptical about just
where the money goes, it may be interesting to
note that last year right here at Stanford scien
tists received $20,000 to further their important
infantile paralysis research.
Today, when you pass a "Join the 400" sign
on the Quad, in the Cellar, or outside of the
Libe, don't just hurry by. Stop for 30 seconds
and think.
And you will contribute a dime.
