# Remember the War?
## 
### 
YESTERDAY morning "History 1940" said that
the Allies are fighting a sloppy war, and
Stanford read it and said, "Oh, really?" and
turned to the intramural results.
Today on the first page of The Daily Stanford
will read that the Soviets have sent a fleet of
bombing planes over southern Finland in one
of the worst raids in that two-month-old war.
Stanford will think, "It is cold in Finland now,"
and turn to the back page to see what is playing
at the movies.
And why not?
Remember the excitement here on the West
Coast on that Sunday two weeks before autumn
guarter when France and England declared
war on Germany? And how that excitement
was still alive when school began, and The
Daily ran stories about Stanford people still in
Europe, and colleges all over the country were

conducting polls on war, and people were
writing campus opinion letters about war? And
the excitement again just before finals last quar
ter when Russia attacked Finland?
Where is that excitement today, the fear of
war, the feeling of adventure in war? The war
itself is six thousand miles away. The spirit of
war is nearly that far away, for that reason.
War is still vivid in the East. You see that
by reading The New Yorker, by reading letters
from cities on the East Coast. But war is close
there. War is going on in the ocean in front
of their homes. They are in closer contact with
people recently in Europe.
But here in the West, here at Stanford, we
hear of the war almost exclusively in the news
papers and radio press reports. The datelines
"Western Front", "Helsinki", "London", "Ber
lin", are no longer new. They don't catch the
eye, even under headlines which scream that
55 people were killed by Soviet bombs.
At Stanford the war is simply a matter of
words and headlines. A Stanford basketball
victory is more important than any European
battle.
And why not?â€”D. J.
