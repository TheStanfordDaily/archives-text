### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
BOMBS. BOMBAST. AND BERLIN
I>ERNARR McFADDEN, who mixes heart-throbs and
platitudes very profitably, has again strained the
gullibility of the American public with one of his
"sensation stories." This time it was H. G. Wells in a
pleasant little number about "bombing Berlin.''
Wells' well-paid imagination envisages a mass at
tack on Nazi cities to crush once and for all the Ger
man phoenix. In his book, "Things to Come, the
famous author predicted some years ago that civiliza
tion would come to a savage end around 1941. At first
glimpse it would seem that Wells is doing his part to
make the prophecy come true.
The British pamphlet air-raid of Germany had a
measure of plausibility about it. The leaflets dropped
from the sky to say that Britain was fighting the
Nazi leaders, and not the German people. But H. G.
Wells is all for reversing the British attitude. Let's
finish this business in short order, he says. That's fine,
H. G., we're killing the pride of our manhood now.
Let's start on the women and children.

|>UT Wells' stand is not solitary evidence of the anti
humanity course that the second World War is
taking. Neville Chamberlain and Edouard Daladier
told the world a few days ago that the Allies, already
planning the next "Armistice," have a great scheme for
permanent peace. The essential features revolve around
a domination of Europe by the governments of Britain
and France. It looks as though Germany is to be
crushed once again. In Vei'saillcs, on some quiet No
vember 11th, the clock can be turned back to 1918.
Of course, the prospect of a German "peace" isn't
exactly cheery.
Few people think that Adolph and his comrades
would sponsor a very cozy little federation of Euro
pean states. A democracy in which everyone would
have a perfect right to agree with Hitler or die would
be about the best one could hope for.
But the British plan, to start things all over again
from the 1918 basis, doesn't hold much hope for world
civilization either. Men struggled for national democ
racy a long time. It looks like the struggle for inter
national democracy will be a long one too. And
meanwhile we have bombs and bombast.
It would be nice if we could rig up a private little
projection room with three comfortable chairs in it.
Chamberlain. Daladier, and H. G. Wells could sit there
and watch a well-done production of Mr. Wells' mas
terful movie, "Things to Come." It shows how eternal
warfare reduces the world to a pile of black ashes.
