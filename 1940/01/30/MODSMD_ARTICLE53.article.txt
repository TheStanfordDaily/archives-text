# PEST HOUSE PROTESTS
## 
### 
r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
We of the Pest House demand recognition. Surely
we are not unreasonable in maintaining that our place
of retreat is on a social par with the Hospital and the
Rest Home. Imagine our chagrin in finding that for
all our suffering we did not receive the solace of seeing
our names in print. Class preference, that's what it is.
And besides, how can we get any flowers or candy if
no one knows we're sick?
Ward A, The Pest House
