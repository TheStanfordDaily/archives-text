# CAVIAR ON THE COMMONS
## 
### 
HPHE EDITOR, SIR:
At the risk of being branded a scab in the pay of
Encina Commons and a traitor to the cause, I would
like to register a vehement protest against the senti
ments expressed by "An Encinaman" in The Daily, on
the subject of the food at Encina. I dislike poor food
as much as the next fellow, but I would like you to
know that there are few of us here, a minority I
must admit, who are sick and tired, not of the food,
but of hearing the continual complaining and grum
bling that goes on in the dining halls every meal.
Of course, it's too bad for the poor boys who have
spent their lives minching caviar at the Ritz or guz
zling filet mignons every evening at some ultra-ultra
prep school to have to lower themselves to eating or
dinary food for a change. I might suggest that one can
get meals fit for a fastidious palate at the President
Hotel in Paly: naturally, they would charge a slight
bit more than they do at Encina, but what is a slight
detail like that to a true gourmet.
# » * *
I WOULD just like to know how many of the suf
fering have ever had an intimate acquaintance with
(he diet of the average wage-earners family in these
prosperous United States, not to mention the starving
Armenians, or should I say starving Finns?
How many of them get fresh milk three times per
day or meat, any kind, shape, size, or color, even once
a day?
Anyone taking the trouble to do a little analyzing
on the subject could discover that the diet at Encina
Commons, while not a custom made model, is fully
balanced and has sufficient nutritional value to keep
even a hard-working(?) freshman alive and kicking.
In spite (if the foregoing, I have no objection to any
food committee that might be formed. You might call
it the Committee for the Investigation of Un-American
Activities in Encina Commons, or "Who Put the For
eign Element in Mrs. Murphy's Chowder?"

ments expressed by "An Encinaman" in The Daily, on
the subject of the food at Encina. I dislike poor food
as much as the next fellow, but I would like you to
know that there are few of us here, a minority I
must admit, who are sick and tired, not of the food,
but of hearing the continual complaining and grum
bling that goes on in the dining halls every meal.
Of course, it's too bad for the poor boys who have
spent their lives minching caviar at the Ritz or guz
zling filet mignons every evening at some ultra-ultra
prep school to have to lower themselves to eating or
dinary food for a change. I might suggest that one can
get meals fit for a fastidious palate at the President
Hotel in Paly: naturally, they would charge a slight
bit more than they do at Encina, but what is a slight
detail like that to a true gourmet.

I WOULD just like to know how many of the suf
fering have ever had an intimate acquaintance with
(he diet of the average wage-earners family in these
prosperous United States, not to mention the starving
Armenians, or should I say starving Finns?
How many of them get fresh milk three times per
day or meat, any kind, shape, size, or color, even once
a day?
Anyone taking the trouble to do a little analyzing
on the subject could discover that the diet at Encina
Commons, while not a custom made model, is fully
balanced and has sufficient nutritional value to keep
even a hard-working(?) freshman alive and kicking.
In spite (if the foregoing, I have no objection to any
food committee that might be formed. You might call
it the Committee for the Investigation of Un-American
Activities in Encina Commons, or "Who Put the For
eign Element in Mrs. Murphy's Chowder?"
