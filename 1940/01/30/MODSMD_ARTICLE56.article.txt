# 'Victor Herbert' Offers Good Music but Old Plot
## 
### 
"THE GREAT VICTOR HERBERT," now playing al the Fox-Stanford.
Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy gels girl.
Thus in nine words tbe plot of "The Great Victor Herbert" is de
scribed, although necessity requires some alteration and additions to the
time-worn theme. The picture is disappointing in that the life of Victor

Herbert is not depicted; he is used,
only as an excuse for another boy
meets-girl production.
"The Great Victor Herbert" deals
with the gay nineties, the romance
and trajedies of the light opera
stage. Mary Martin achieves stage
success through Herbert's star
singer, Allan Jones, whom she mar
ries not knowing that he is one big
heel. She has a great stage future
ahead, but retires from the stage so
that her husband may have all of
the spotlight, but he hits the down
ward trail through his conceit and
selfishness.
Disappointment No. 2 is that Mary
Martin was given the build-up as
the "Heart Belongs to Daddy Girl,"
yet she did not sing one torchy swing
song. But being a very beautiful
woman and singing Herbert's class
ics very well, Mary Martin's debut
on the screen was more than satis
factory.
Allan Jones again depends upon
his voice and curly hair, for his act
ing is far from polished. Walter Con
nelly as the toothless Victor Her
bert, or the toothless Connelly as
Herbert, was well cast in the role.
"The Great Victor Herbert" just
misses the classification of "mediocre
movie" by its excellent music and
presentation of colorful scenes from
Herbert's operettas.â€”Silverman
