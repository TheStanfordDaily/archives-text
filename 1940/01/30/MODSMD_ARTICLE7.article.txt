# Boat Club Men To Build Scow
## Redwood May Build New Float for Crew 
### 
With almost all obstacles removed,
Stanford's Boat Club will meet to
morrow to discuss definite plans to
build a training scow. Forty-three
members have signed up and pledged
to pay the $5 membership fee. The
club already has $90 in its treasury.
Ted Cole, club president, said that
barring Ihe unexpected, the rowers
should be on the water before the
end of February.
Lumber for the barge has already
been ordered. At present the plan
is to have members build the barge
from plans already drawn up.
The Redwood City Recreation
Committee has tentatively offered to
construct a float which can be used
for crew in the spring and for swim
ming in the summer. If the plan is
officially confirmed, the Boat Club
will be saved an expenditure of over
$500. Redwood City has also tenta
tively agreed to provide some used
lumber for the construction of a
building.
Members of the Boat Club also are
going to do the construction work
on the boat house. The contracting
company that is building the Hoover
War Libe is another possible source
of lumber.
Executive officers of the club have
been keeping up correspondence to
try and determine how much alumni
support they can count on.
