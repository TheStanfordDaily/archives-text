# Johansen Designs Geometric Sets to Portray Amazons
## 
### 
Sets, which Technical Director Waldcmar Johansen considers the best
used in a Stanford production since "Twelfth Night," given during the
summer of '37, are being planned for "The Warrior's Husband," which
will be produced Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights in Memorial Hall.
Johansen's primary problem was to discover just what a land of Ama-

zon women would be like. Since,
there are no actual records of the
land, and even some doubt if it did
exist at all outside Greek mythology,
he was forced to use his imagination.
DESIGNS TYPICAL
Reasoning that the Amazons must
have been primitive and barbaric,
Director Johansen decided to use
geometric designs because these are
typical of most primitive folk.
Dominant feature of the throne
room set is a huge ramp running
the entire width of +he stage. At its
highest point, it stands 11 feet above
the stage level.
BARBARISM STRESSED
Warm colors — pinkish brown for
the furnishings and ramp, and tur
quoise for the sky projected on the
cyclorama — have been used to em
phasize the barbaric effect.
According to Johansen, the warmth
of the colore absorbs so much light
that every piece of lighting equip
ment in the theater has been called
into use.
TENTS FAKED
Though the second act set, an
Amazon field camp, requires only
three actual tents, an encampment
of 5,000 warriors had to be sug
gested. To this end thousands of
tents stretching into the distance
will be projected onto the cyclo
rama.
In contrast to the warmth of the
first two sets, the last scene in
Theseus' tent utilizes cool blue
draperies and very simple furnish
ing. Color will be supplied by the
glittering Greek and Amazon cos
tumes during the Bacchanalian rev
elry climaxing the third act.
Tickets are 50 cents and may be
reserved by telephoning P.A. 22041.
