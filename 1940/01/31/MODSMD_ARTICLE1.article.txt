### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
WEVEN years ago AdoLf Hitler rose
K to power in Germany.
And last night, in a surprise
speech that marked the anniversary
of this accession to authority, Hitler
proclaimed the fact that Germany's
strength is near its peak. His
countrymen, Hitler says, are ready
to carry the fight to Great Britain
and France in the "second phase"
of the war.
Before a "hciling" crowd in Ber
lin's huge Sportspalast, the Chan
cellor blasted the Allies for till
minutes. His speech, for the most
part, was delivered in a mono
tone, describing the injustices
heaped upon (he German people
after the World War and Brit
ain's desire to "crush and destroy"
them.

"They wanted the war, and I can
lell Britain and France they will get
war," Hitler said, his voice breaking
with emotion.
Accepting what he called "Brit
ain's challenge," he said he hoped
"bombs will begin to fall and that
women and children will not be
spared." As he spoke, German
planes were winging across the
channel to drop their messages of
death on England's coastal cities.

/ I ERMANY is prepared for the
second phase of the war, Hitler
.said. Because friendly Italy and
Russia stand guard against any Al
lied attempt to attack Germany
from the rear as they did in 1914-18,
the Nazis are today secure, he indi
cated- Hitler addressed part of his
speech directly to French Premier
Edouard Daladier. "Monsieur Dala
dier," he said, "you will get to know
Germany's regiments personally."
Significantly, Hitler boasted up
on the failure of all Allied efforts
to entice Italy and Soviet Kussia
away from Germany and he dwelt
in detail upon Italo-Gcrman
friendship which he promised will
be enduring. Significantly, too, he
made no reference to neutrals. He
did not warn them against Brit
ish-French efforts, such as those
of Churchill, to draw them into
the war. Other Nazi leaders have
recently warned the neutrals
against the Allies. Nor did he
mention the rigors and sacrifices
which the German people must
endure.
Instead he ridiculed Neville
Chamberlain, said that Germany is
ready for Churchill's challenge. On
the day of the outbreak of war Hit
ler announced he was donning his
uniform to take it off only "in vic
tory or death." And he reiterated
his willingness to sacrifice his life to
be "the saviour of the German peo
ple." And this anniversary speech
was Der Feuhrer's first formal one
since his visit to the Munich beer
parlor and shrine of Naziism on
Nov. 9, where he escaped assassina
tion by 11 short, dramatic minutes.

JLJITLER'S speech yesterday was
""" one of contrast with his speech
of a year ago when he spoke to a
rapidly-arming Germany on the
sixth anniversary of the rise of
Naziism. Then he assailed the "Bol
shevik chaos" of Russia, where he
said thousands of priests were but
chered and burned. Just for a laugh,
it's interesting to recall that he men
tioned on that occasion that "there
can scarcely be any difference of
opinion" between Poland and Ger
many, which he callcd the "true
friend of peace."
Yesterday Hitler was effusive in
his boasts of his alliance with Rus
sia. Assailing Daladier as a "brutal
madman," he considered the French
as "lured into the conflict by Brit
ain." Sarcastically he referred to
Allied war aims, foreseeing a Euro
pean confederation with the barriers
of heavy armaments and restricted
trade torn down.
