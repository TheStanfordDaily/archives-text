# $15 Missing From Farm 'Dime' Cans
## Polio Finance Drive Terminates Tonight; Goal May Be Reached 
### 
Approximately $15 worth of dimes
are missing in the "March of Dimes"
drive, it was revealed late last night,
when three collection cans were im
ported gone. Two were missing since
6 o'clock last night from the library,
one upstairs, the other outside in
front; and the third, from the post
office, has been gone since Sunday.
General Drive Chairman George
Nadeau and Kirby Low, treasurer,
reported the loss, estimating it from
the fact that the usual day's take
per can in the library is about $5.50.
Issuing a formal statement, Bob
McNeil, president of Alpha Phi
Omega, who is organizing the drive,
said, "It is indeed unfortunate that
the work of a service organization
in attempting to bring relief to crip
pled children should be so seriously
hampered by the unscrupulous per
son who has wilfully appropriated
the receptacles publicly displayed
for the collection of dimes."
Last-minute reports showed Offi
cer George Bums and Bob McNeil
checking on possible suspects.

DRIVE ENDS TODAY
The call for $400 to donate to Pres
ident. Roosevelt's nation-wide fight
against infantile paralysis ends to
day. Collection cans and canvassers'
reports will be tabulated tonight and
Stanford's total contribution will be
announced.
According to Jim Thurmond, pub
licity director for the drive, chances
for reaching the goal of $400 are very
good. "The money in hand adds up
to only $100. but there is much more
than that in the contribution cans,
which won't be opened until the
drive is over," he said in an inter
view last night.
HONOR ROLL INCREASES
Seven more living groups have
been added to the "honor roll" of
groups reporting a dime collected
from evpry resident. The roll at 9
o'clock last night stood as follows:
Branner Hall, Theta Chi, Alpha Tau
Omega, Alpha Kappa Lambda, Fire
housc, Elm Cottage, Casa Olivo (La
£unita), Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Phi
Delta Theta, and Sigma Nu.
As a part of an eleventh-hour
drive initiated at an A.P.O. meeting
Monday afternoon, seven Roble girls
were detailed to contact faculty
members for contributions today.
The seven are: Leslie Langnecker,
Marjorie Reed, Elizabeth Griffin,
Virginia Kirkland, Joan Litchfield,
Francis Winston, and Carol Kasch.
Approximately $15 worth of dimes
are missing in the "March of Dimes"
drive, it was revealed late last night,
when three collection cans were im
ported gone. Two were missing since
6 o'clock last night from the library,
one upstairs, the other outside in
front; and the third, from the post
office, has been gone since Sunday.
General Drive Chairman George
Nadeau and Kirby Low, treasurer,
reported the loss, estimating it from
the fact that the usual day's take
per can in the library is about $5.50.
Issuing a formal statement, Bob
McNeil, president of Alpha Phi
Omega, who is organizing the drive,
said, "It is indeed unfortunate that
the work of a service organization
in attempting to bring relief to crip
pled children should be so seriously
hampered by the unscrupulous per
son who has wilfully appropriated
the receptacles publicly displayed
for the collection of dimes."
