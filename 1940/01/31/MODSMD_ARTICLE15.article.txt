# Wolter Leaves Big Leagues To Coach Stanford Baseball
## 
### BUD AMES 
Gibraltar of Stanford's coaching staff is Harry Meiggs Wolter, director
of baseball and a coach who really grow up in his business.
Harry's Farm days began hack in l!Mf> when he coached the varsity
nine "for nothing and just for fun," as he put it. As he chatted, he kept
constant watch on two of his pitchers who were warming up. He pointed

to Stanford's ace hurdler, Sid Hayes,
one of the pitchers.
"That was the year that Sid's
father was baseball captain," Harry
recalled. He can remember the
names and dates of all his baseball
teams, but he stumbled modestly
when asked about his life.
PLAYS AT SANTA CLARA
Harry broke into the baseball
business down at his alma mater,
Sailfa Clara. In 1900 he played as a
pitcher and an outfielder on the pro
fessional Fresno nine.
"I played in the outfield five days
a week and pitched the other two.
We only played seven days a week,"
he said seriously, but he soon started
chuckling. Jokes are his pets; if he
can confuse one of his players he is
happy.
From then on, his history reads
like a tourist's itinerary. In 1907 he
was sold into the big leagues to Cin
cinatti for more pitching and out
fielding. The next year he played
in an "outlaw league" and then in
1909 he was sold for a higher price
to the Boston Red Socks.
STARS FOR YANKEES
His next stop was the New York
Yankees, where he starred until he
broke his leg in 1914. Ho rested out
here in Los Angeles, and that's
where he first became associated
with Stanford. Then suddenly a hurt
look came over Harry's face.
"I spent 1921 and '22 guaging for
the Standard Oil Company," he ad
mitted. A blow to a baseball man.
"Then in '23 —I think it was '23—
yes, no, yes. In 23 I came to Stan
ford as the baseball coach."
Today in addition to running a
team he is director of intramurals,
which he terms "as good as any in
the country," and a golf instructor
twice a week.
"Picking the best player I ever
had is one tough job," Harry said. "I
think one of the best pitchers I ever
