### 
Stanford's spring trysting place,
Lake Lagunita, according to all avail
able sources, will be open for gen
j eral use by Saturday.
I Two new flat-bottom row boats
i for the life guards will arrive by
Friday, Student Manager John
Cobbs revealed yesterday. Repre
senting the boathou.se crew, Jack
Behr said that one day after the
new boats arrive Lagunita will be
ready to open.
The new boats are needed to clear
heavy debris now floating around
on the lake. "If the boats come by
Friday, we can have the lake cleared
I and everything ready by Saturday,"
; Behr stated.
He also urged all living groups
owning boats which are in need of
repairs or paint jobs to finish the
work by the end of this week so
that this will not interfere with
normal operations at the boathouse
when the lake is open to all stu
dents.
It is estimated by life guards that
j at the present time there is more
! water in Lagunita than there was
|at any time last year.

Crewmen Meet
Tonight a 18:30

Club to Discuss Plan
For Building Barge

Ted Cole, president of the Stan
ford Boat Club, announced a meet
ing of crew members in Room 214
of the history building at 8:30
o'clock tonight to discuss plans for
starting construction of a training
barge and a shed to house the club's
shell.
The plan is to divide the 43 mem
bers into groups to go to Redwood
City every day and work. Lumber
for the barge has already been or
dered, and several sources have
promised to provide used lumber
for the shed.
Any men who are interested in
going out for crew, but were unable
to attend the first two meetings, are
urged by Cole to attend tonight and
sign up. If they can't get to the
meeting, they can still sign up in
Room 139 at Encina.
The club now has $105 in its treas
ury from membership fees, but over
half of those who signed up at the
last meeting haven't paid yet.
"If student support continues,"
Cole said last night, "we'll be able
to put a crew on the water within
a few weeks regardless of whether
we get any alumni help."
