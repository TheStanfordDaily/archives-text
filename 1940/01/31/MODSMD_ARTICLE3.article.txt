# Nazi Bombs Hit 12 Ships Off Britain
## Renewed 'Blitzkrieg' Takes Over 65 Lives During Past 48 Hours 
### 
LONDON. Jan. 30 (UP).—A wave
of German bombing planes sweeping
upon the British coasts for the sec
ond consecutive day bombed and
machine-gunned at least 12 ships
today and increased to G5 or more
the lives of seamen taken in the
"Blitzkrieg" attacks of the past 48
hours.
British fighting planes, rising to
meet the challenge of the Nazi aerial
offensive against British and neutral
shipping, shot down one Heinkel
bomber at sea and disabled another,
presumably killing its rear gunner,
the Air Ministry reported.
Today's attacks, lasting from dawn
until darkness, again extended
along a 500-mile stretch of the Eng
lish and Scottish coasts and were
staged by 20 German planes—the
largest fleet sent across the North
Sea by the Germans since the start
of the war.
LINER BOMBED
The 5,070-ton Ellerman passenger
liner City of Bath was bombed and
machine-gunned off the Firth of
Tay on the Scottish coast in two
separate attacks but drove off the
raiders with her anti-aircraft guns
after which British planes pursued
the Germans out to sea.
During the past 24 hours at least
25 ships of all sizes and nationalities
have been bombed and machine
gunned, it was reported.
In Berlin it was announced 19
ships have been destroyed since
Monday morning, including 14 armed
merchantmen and five patrol boats,
and that German planes today sank
seven merchantmen and two patrol
ships and damaged several others.
It was admitted one German plane
failed to return from today's at
tacks.
'GERMANS EXAGGERATE'
A government spokesman insisted
tonight, however, that the German
claims were "grossly exaggerated."
The ships attacked today included
thi-ee armed trawlers off Great Yar
mouth; the steamer Jersey Queen,
the tanker British Triumph and the
collier Coryton off the east coast, a
lightship and the Grimsby trawler
Alcoma. Some of the ships were
traveling in naval convoy and others
were alone.
The trawler Lady Shirley was at
tacked some miles at sea but pre
sumably was not seriously damaged
and proceeded on her voyage.
Today's wave of attacks was
launched at dawn when anti-aircraft
guns along the Tyneside went into
action against a German bomber
which dropped two bombs at an out
going steamer while British planes
sped in pursuit but were unable to
catch the raider. The last attack
was at 5 o'clock when a Nazi plane
dropped four or five bombs on a
trawler off Great Yarmouth.

action against a German bomber

trawler off Great Yarmouth.
LONDON. Jan. 30 (UP).—A wave
of German bombing planes sweeping

meet the challenge of the Nazi aerial
offensive against British and neutral
shipping, shot down one Heinkel
bomber at sea and disabled another,
presumably killing its rear gunner,
the Air Ministry reported.
