## JERRY MAYER, Sports Editor Baseball Team Loses Jameson Year with Jaysee Varsity Makes Captain of Stanford Nine Ineligible For Coast University Competition 
### 
Captain Bill Jameson will not play ball this year for Harry Walter's
Card diamond nine.
Elected last spring to skipper the club, Jameson has been declared in
eligible because of a year of competition at Sacramento Junior College.
He was held out of the lirst two practice games his team played while his
case was investigated. *

Jameson's only year of competi
tion al Sacramento was not ac
cepted as equal to a freshman year
because the Capitol nine played a
varsity schedule. He has played two
years in a Stanford uniform since
coming to the Farm,
I.El) CARD BATTERS
Last spring, as regular catcher, he
led the Cards in batting with a .380
average and was one of the best all
around backstops in the league. His
timely hits pulled several ball games
out of the fire.
With Jameson on the bench, his
position as first-string receiver will
be wide open. Sid Lewis and Jack
Randall will be top candidates for
the spot. Neither has had much ex
perience, although Lewis saw some
action last year, mainly as a pinch
hitter. Randall is a junior college
transfer who has worked well in the
practice games.
PLAY ALL-STARS
The Woltermen will take on San
Francisco's Gaddini All-Stars this
afternoon on the Sunken Diamond.
Starting time will be 3:15 o'clock
and admission will be free.
Sid Hayes, better known as a high
hurdler, will start in the box for the
Cards. Hayes started last Wednes
day against the Kenealy Seals. A
combination of a wet ball and
some major league hitters caused
him to retire after the first inning
with two runs scored.
COSTELLO ON FIRST
Hal Costello is slated to open at
first. Costello, by his work against
the Seals, seems to have just about
cinched the post. Harry Parsons
will start at second. Another trans
fer, Parsons is fighting Dick G hortall
for the job of guarding the keystone
sack. Monty Pfyl will get the call
at short and Elton Boone will be on
third.
Norm Juney will be the only man
in the starting outfield that was on
hist year's club. Transfer Alex
Cereghino and gridder Jim Ver
dieck will be in center and right
fields.
