### JERRY MAYER 
IS INDIAN GRID
OPENER A BUTCHV
It begins to look as if some very
! well-laid plans by Stanford's sched-
I ule-makers bounced right back in
their faces when California an
nounced the other day that the Bears
would open their li) 40 football sea
son by playing an intersectional
game with Michigan in Berkeley's
' Memorial Stadium.
For on the very same day, Sept.
28, Stanford will be opening its sea-
I son against a very tough University
of San Francisco team in the Bay
City's Kezar Stadium.
When it was announced recently
that Stanford would open the sea
i son against the Dons, the news
was received by Cardinal fans
with mixed emotions. II was
! pointed out that U.S.F., with a vet
eran team returning, would be
I gunning for a victory over the In
dians, who will be playing their
first game under a new coach and
will be trying for the first time
under fire a system that they
have never used before.
If there ever was a spot for the
Dons io crack the headlines by
{ defeating a big-league team, this
is it. Furthermore, U.S.F. has
absolutely no national ranking in
the football world and a defeat at
i its hands would be comparable to
Notre Dame losing its first game
to College of Pacific next year.
At least, these persons argued, if
we lost to Santa Clara or a confer
! ence team in our opener we would
be dropping a game to a nationally
recognized football team and our
reputation would not suffer ,«uch a
| serious blow.
On the other hand, if Stanford tri
umphs over San Francisco, it will
: be fully expected and nothing will
1 be gained except the bruises.
However, the game was supposedly
scheduled in order to promote more
cordial relationships between Stan
ford and a San Francisco sports
going populace that has shown a
notable apathy toward attending
| Stanford games. It was thought by
| the schedule makers that by playing
; the Dons, the Indians could gain
i thousands of Bay City supporters
| who usually root wholeheartedly for
! California.
San Francisco's fans may be
! grateful for the opportunity given
[ U.S.F. to break into a Coast Con
ference schedule, but there is no
i doubt now that 70.000 persons or
thereabouts will jam Memorial
j Stadium to see the Bears face a
| Michigan team that will be lead
by the great Tom Harmon in an
I important intersectional game.
. while Kezar Stadium will he for
tunate to have 15.000 attend the
Don-Cardinal contest.
So now all the Cards have is a
J game with a team which it can gain
! nothing by beating, and can lose a
I lot of face by not beating. And
| California will continue to have (he
j fans in the habit of watching—and
rooting for—the Bears.

It begins to look as if some very
! well-laid plans by Stanford's sched-
I ule-makers bounced right back in
their faces when California an
nounced the other day that the Bears
would open their li) 40 football sea
son by playing an intersectional
game with Michigan in Berkeley's
' Memorial Stadium.
For on the very same day, Sept.
28, Stanford will be opening its sea-
I son against a very tough University
of San Francisco team in the Bay
City's Kezar Stadium.
When it was announced recently
that Stanford would open the sea
i son against the Dons, the news
was received by Cardinal fans
with mixed emotions. II was
! pointed out that U.S.F., with a vet
eran team returning, would be
I gunning for a victory over the In
dians, who will be playing their
first game under a new coach and
will be trying for the first time
under fire a system that they
have never used before.
If there ever was a spot for the
Dons io crack the headlines by
{ defeating a big-league team, this
is it. Furthermore, U.S.F. has
absolutely no national ranking in
the football world and a defeat at
i its hands would be comparable to
Notre Dame losing its first game
to College of Pacific next year.
At least, these persons argued, if
we lost to Santa Clara or a confer
! ence team in our opener we would
be dropping a game to a nationally
recognized football team and our
reputation would not suffer ,«uch a
| serious blow.
On the other hand, if Stanford tri
umphs over San Francisco, it will
: be fully expected and nothing will
1 be gained except the bruises.
However, the game was supposedly
scheduled in order to promote more
cordial relationships between Stan
ford and a San Francisco sports
going populace that has shown a
notable apathy toward attending
| Stanford games. It was thought by
| the schedule makers that by playing
; the Dons, the Indians could gain
i thousands of Bay City supporters
| who usually root wholeheartedly for
! California.
San Francisco's fans may be
! grateful for the opportunity given
[ U.S.F. to break into a Coast Con
ference schedule, but there is no
i doubt now that 70.000 persons or
thereabouts will jam Memorial
j Stadium to see the Bears face a
| Michigan team that will be lead
by the great Tom Harmon in an
I important intersectional game.
. while Kezar Stadium will he for
