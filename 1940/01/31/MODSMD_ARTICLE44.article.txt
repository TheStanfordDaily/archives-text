# Broncs, Gaels To Meet Card Five at Kezar
## Indian Casers Hold Spotlight in Week-end Double-headers in City 
### 
It will be a star-studded show
that Stanford's cagers go into Fri-
J day and Saturday nights in Kezar
Pavilion at San Francisco.
Making up the impressive basket-
I ball slate, which has been designed
| to whip up more interest in the
sport with Bay city fans, are Coach
Everett Dean's second-place South
i ern Divisioners, St. Mary's, Santa
' Clara, and the University of San
S Francisco.
The teams probably rank in that
order, although last year it turned
out that the three top teams were
pretty well matched. Again the all
| star set-up may be turned topsy
] turvy should the favorites get ofT
| to slow starts.
I TWO DOUBLE-HEADERS
It will be a double-header both
nights, similar to the games played
at Berkeley last week. With Stan
\ ford and Santa Clara taking the
j spotlight in the first night, U.S.F. and
the Gaels will start the proceedings
j at 7:30 o'clock.
Then it will be vice-versa in op
i ponents the next night, with the In
dians taking on Harlan Dykes'
Moragans in the headliner, while
Santa Clara entertains U.S.F. in the
| preliminary. For 50 cents per head
I or 25 cents per Stanford student body
! card holder that's quite a show for
! an evening's entertainment,
j COLORFUL STARS
Although losers by close margins
j to the Bears last week, the Gaels
| and Broncos are actually two smart
i ly-handled ball clubs, and have had
1 reasonable success in games to date
ito back up their contentions. Santa
! Clara was impressive in its Christ
! mas vacation tour of the East, losing
I by two points to DePaul, one of the
I Mid-West's strongest contingents.
Santa Clara has a hot-shot for
ward, Giannini, who once was
! called a counterpart of the great
| Hank Luisetti when they played
against each other in San Francisco
high school competition. St. Mary's
1 has a colorful player in Feerick.
[ Besides these men, Stanford's two
I rivals have some other good shots to
' back them up.
OUT FOR REVENGE
Stanford took it on the chin last
year in a similar series in the local
Pavilion. The Broncos took them
51-48 and the Gaels came through
in another close one, 37-34. Smart -
I ing under the double set-back to
last year's brethren, the Indians
will be out to avenge those defeats.
However, as far as workouts go,
Coach Everett Dean isn't doing
much about getting the boys pre
| pared for the games. After two
bruising games down South against
the Trojans, Dean decided rest
would do the team a lot of good so
he called off practices for last Mon
day and tomorrow. However, (he
team is slated for a light session this
afternoon, topping off yesterday's
equally light drill.
Men can live within a range of
! 200 degrees of temperature vana
j tion. but their body temperatures
J cannot vary 20 degrees.
