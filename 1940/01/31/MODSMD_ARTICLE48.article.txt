THERE are some stories that even The Daily
hates to print. But facts are facts, and there
is no point in trying to whitewash them.
Yesterday, President Roosevelt's birthday,
three "March of Dimes" receptacles were miss
ing from their places on the campus. Approxi
mately 15 dollars was appropriated by some
person who, no matter how poor he is, does
not need it nearly as badly as the unfortunate,
crippled children to whose aid it was supposed
to go.
If this job was the work of a would-be come
dian, by this time he knows what a complete
failure his attempt at humor has been. It is
difficult to believe that there is anyone on the
Stanford campus mean enough or stupid enough
to have stolen the containers with malice afore
thought.
Yet somebody must have taken it; the re
ceptacles did not get up and walk away under
their own steam. Whoever the guilty person
is probably is dogged by thoughts of misshapen
little spines and twisted legs and useless arms
right now.
Fortunately, most of us would rather starve.
