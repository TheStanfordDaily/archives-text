TWO years ago this quarter Women's Con
ference decided to eliminate the tears and
heartbreaks from the feminine side of campus
politics. In order to avoid the grief that custom
arily followed the selection of candidates by
Hall and Row caucuses, Conference set itself
up as a board to examine all prospective women
candidates and to select a "recommended"
slate.
This sifting process was designed to have
no effect whatever on ambitious female poli
ticians who did not rate the august okay. They
were eligible to run too, provided they were
nominated by their friends.
Conference merely was trying to make sure
that the best qualified women ran for every
office and that all the candidates understood
fully the duties of the offices for which they
were vying. However, inevitably the blessing
of Conference came to spell victory, and other
possible nominees were discouraged from run
ning.
In an effort to eliminate these unfair odds,
and at the same time to retain the advantages
of better candidates and fuller appreciation of
responsibilities, this year Women's Conference
has decided to withhold its recommendations
until all other nominations have been an
nounced.
Of course, only 27 women, representing ev
ery female living group on the campus, will
know which aspirants for office will get the
nod, and of course not one of them would think
of breathing it to a soul.
Furthermore, once the nominations are closed
the names of the favorite daughters will be an
nounced, and they still will have the advan
tages of Conference's approval in the final reck
oning.
It is true that the women are doing everything
possible to democratize their new nominating
system. But it is just a little like trying to give
a minority party a break in Nazi Germany.
