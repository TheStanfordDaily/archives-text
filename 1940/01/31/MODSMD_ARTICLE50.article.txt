ANY suggestions which can be expected to
cut into the "seasonal" rush at the hospitals
and rest homes, where yesterday 55 Stanford
men and women were confined, will save a
tremendous amount of human time and effort.
Yesterday Dr. Thomas A. Storey, medical
adviser of men, issued a few health suggestions
which he considered valuable in preventing in
fluenza and colds, the current complaints at
the' rest homes, and also commented upon Stan
ford styles and fads as they affect the health
of the student body.
Especially lauded was the current appearance

on the campus of high rubber boots, worn by
a large number of the women students. The
boots are not only practical in wet weather, but
they look good, too, the doctor commented.
That Stanford students do not wear enough
clothing in cold weather was the gist of his
criticism. He suggested that light sweaters,
open shirts, hatless heads, thin dresses, were
poor protection.
Also suggested was avoidance of wet feet,
contact with others who have colds, sudden
temperature changes, and, for those especially
susceptible, sleeping on open porches.
In spite of rumors to the contrary, the day
when a kiss may be expected to kill cold germs
has not arrived. But a little practical care at
the present time may relieve the demand for
hospital beds.—J. B.
