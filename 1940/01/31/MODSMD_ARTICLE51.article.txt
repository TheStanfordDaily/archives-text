CONFESSIONS OF A PREFERENTIAL VOTER
OOLITICAL science majors and my roommate have
descended upon me with gusto. One harmless
little criticism of the preferential ballot and I have
been subjected to an involuntary education: "How to
Vote" the course is entitled, days and hours at the
mercy of my assorted professors.
My original allegation was, as I remember it, that
preferential voting is fine in theory, but fails in prac
tice. That much my critics agree with. But I then
asserted that preferential ballots give the voter a per
fect opportunity to assist his favorite by stabbing other
worthies in the back. There I was wrong, I have dis
covered—not entirely on my own resources. The pref
erential ballot, when misused, gives malicious voters
like myself an opportunity to stab themselves, not
other candidates. And so the solution seems to lie in
education of us ignoramuses, and not in changing the
voting system.
If I want Mr. Prune to be President of the Food
Club, I give Mr. Prune my first-choice vote. I may
then figure to myself that Miss Peach is the next
strongest candidate. So I may give her my third -
choice vote, and give Lemon, obviously a weak sister,
my second-choice vote. If I do that, however, I have
not helped my Mr. Prune at all, contrary to the belief
of myself and a good many other voters. I have not
helped Prune because my second-place vote will not
be counted until Prune has been thrown off the ballot
for want of first-place votes.
* * * *
"tfAD I voted second for Miss Peach, as obviously I
should have done. I would not have weakened
poor Prune's chances of winning at all. because my
second-choice vote for that attractive Peach number
would not have been counted until Prune was out of
the running. So in my blind devotion to a Prune, I
would have penalized a Peach—yes. But the unre
deemable Mr. Prune was beyond the pale; even my
ignorance could not assist the poor chap.
All in all the preferential system resolves itself
down to this: a voter can well penalize a Peach, ig
norantly; but he cannot help a Prune with more than
his first-choice ballot. What distresses me, however, is
that so many people agreed with or were convinced by
the argument that the voter can misuse the prefer
ential ballot to the betterment of his favorite candi
date. Apparently our pre-registration education was
neglected. It was left, for political science majors and
my roommate to show us the light with diagrams and
debate briefs.
And so once again a suggestion seems in order:
how about letting the voters in on the secret of how the
preferential system works bright and early in their
freshman year? I will volunteer the services of my
roommate and the poly sci department. They have a
way about them.
Prunes are beyond the pale, but Peaches are being
squashed.
