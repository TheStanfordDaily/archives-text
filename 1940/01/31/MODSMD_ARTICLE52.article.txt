# CAMPUS OPINION
## TRY A BRUNETTE 
### 
r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
I see by Friday's Daily that a San Francisco phy
sician advocates kissing as a means of killing cold
germs. Kissing, he says, generates sufficient heat to
kill the organisms.
During the last few days I have not been feeling
well, but kissing gives me no relief. My trouble seems
more serious than a cold. What must I do?
Sincerely,
Anxious
