# HE SPEAKS FOR SPEECH

r rHE EDITOR. SIR:
Contributors to The Daily are always abounding
with suggestions for things they believe need to be
done. No doubt, many of these are valid. But I hope
the day is not too distant when on this campus there
will be built a Stanford Speech Clinic, equipped with
all the modern devices, staffed with a complete trained
personnel for the treatment of defective speech.
Stanford today has a clinic of this sort, which has
been doing a great deal of hard work, with limited
personnel, and in crowded quarters. The clinicians
have met with patients wherever they could round up
a room in the basement of the English Corner, or in
the Business School, or even in the Amphitheater.
In spite of these handicaps, and the absence of a cen
tral library for corrective speech, several recording
devices, etc., the clinic does the best it can, and has
enabled students to get jobs in fields where their voices
might have kept them out.

IT IS estimated that only ten per cent of the student
body of an American university have clear, distinct
voices. Fifty per cent are not using their voices effec
tively. A considerable percentage are really defective.
Stanford has long been thought of as an experimental
center in the Bay Area, offering its services in the
field of psychology, education, dramatics, English, and
many other fields. Certainly, this service to school and
locality could be extended greatly if only the clinic
might be housed in a small but up-to-date plant.
The clinic building is not, nor should be, the sub
ject, of feverish arguments, pro and con. But it is cer
tainly a subject which could be thought over. In the
modern world, 95 per cent of all communication is
oral. The vast amount of attention given to written
communication at this and nearly all other schools
should be balanced by some work in the field of cor
rective speech. This cannot be done adequately, no
matter how well it may be organized, with the present
facilities.
Concrete accomplishments of the clinic here can be
indicated by numerous examples. Surely, Stanford
owes this attention to its student body, men and women
it is purportedly sending out into the world with a
certain degree of culture. When a building is com
pleted on this campus, and dedicated as the Stanford
University Speech Clinic, the job of treating and train
ing voices can be done adequately and well.
Sincerely,
Jack R. Anderson
