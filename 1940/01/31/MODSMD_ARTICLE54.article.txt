# Book Reveals Glamorized Stanford to Little Sister
## 
### 
"JOAN'S FRESHMAN YEAR AT
STANFORD," by Dorothy Plum
mer.
If you have a little sister, and
want her to come to Stanford, give
her "Joan's Freshman Year at
Stanford," for girls from 12 to 15.
It's authentic in detail from descrip
tions of pre-reg activities and Roble
sponsors to the Big Game Bonfire
and sorority rushing.
But don't read it yourself for a
good 15 or 20 years hence. The book
would delight a lassie in her early
teens to whom Stanford is a happy
hope in the dim futui'e; it would
warm the heart of an aging grad
whose memories of the Farm had
faded to a sentimental haze. But its
necessarily idealized view of campus
life would call forth only a cynical
snort from the average undergrad
uate.
ALL-AROUND GIRL
Joan Whitney is one of those all
around personality girls who (all in
her freshman year!) manages to
make good in dramatics, serve on
sundry committees, be elected class
secretary, help design a set of prize
winning houses for an art class,
pledge her pet sorority, have a let
ter home to mama published as a
news article in the San Francisco
Chronicle, and incidentally earn a
large part of her expenses by typing
theses in her spare time (whew!).
None of this seems to interfere with
her dating extensively and making
honor grades, and she always seems
to find time for a coke in the cellar!
What's more, her brother is cap
tain of the football team, an honor
student in law, also earns a large
portion of his expenses, and is stu
dent body president in his spare
time. Theoretically it's all possible,
except that real-life Farm students
never seem to have any spare time.
BROTHER MAKES GOOD
The book ends gloriously after
brother Hugh has completed a pass
to make the winning touchdown in
the last three seconds of the Big
Game, Joan's villainness-vamp of a
sorority sister has seen the error of
her ways and decided to reform, and
Joan's number one boy friend has an
offer of partnership in her father's
firm after graduation.
In spite of all the frosting, Miss
Plummer's book presents a well
rounded and complete view of Stan
ford life. Joan and her friends havfe
enough problems and disappoint
ments to show the hopeful teenster
that college isn't all "just for fun."
The character portrayals of Joan's
campus friends are typical and
amusing. Emphasis is also placed on
problems of vocational guidance, a

subject woefully neglected in the
average college story.
Of course it sounds a wee bit im
probable when Joan and her friends,
in intimate Roble Bull Sessions, dis
cuss little more than how to pass a
final or what they want to be when
they graduate, but the 12 to 15
year old intended readers probably
aren't too interested in men yet,
anyway.
Miss Plummer does show keen un
derstanding of undergraduate atti
tudes and needs, as well as a real
knowledge of Stanford lore. It's fun
to see what were probably your
own reactions on walking along the
row of brass plates in the Inner
Quad or taking a Western Civ final,
recorded in print.â€”Kline
