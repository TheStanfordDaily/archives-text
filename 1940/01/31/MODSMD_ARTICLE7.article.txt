# Bud Cady Aids In Amazon Epic
## Actor Helps Stage 'Warrior's Husband' 
### 
The man who does everything—
that's Cady.
If you want someone to act in a
television play; understudy the stock
company's lead in, say, Brattleboro,
Vt., or London; or do offstage sound
effects with a pair of coocnuts, ask
Frank Randolph (Bud) Cady, '38,
if he will oblige. The chances are
he will.
Right now he's stage manager for
"Warrior's Husband" while he pre
pares for a Master's degree that will
let him coach college theatricals, and
has his hands full of a job that makes
him responsible "for all the butches,
but none of the glory."
ACTED IN LONDON
Between his graduation and re
turn to the Farm he spent eight
months in England during the Mu
nich crisis, when war was always
"12 hours away." As bit pJayer and
understudy at the Westminster The
ater in London he appeared in
"Marco's Millions" by Eugene O'-
Neill and Schnitzler's "Farewell
Supper," and was a member of the
Phoenix Theater's permanent com
pany.
"That was a new thing," Cady said
of the Phoenix Theater. "The idea
was to have a crew of actors who
had worked together constantly, and
to give them chances to do some of
the newer plays of a higher type.
Runs were anywhere from four to
nine weeks. J. B. Priestley was a
part owner."
This was the period of his career
when he understudied 13 parts for
three plays, and threw in a 8.8.C.
television program for good measure.
And for three nights he spoke five
lines instead of two, because some
body or other was sick.

With Fred Clark, former Stanford
theater favorite who introduced
"baby-killing" to the campus from
the South, Bud Cady worked out
with the well-known Brattleboro
stock company during this last sum
mer.
For seven weeks he acted, prompt
ed in live out of six productions,
later turned down a chance to play
on the road in the company's pro
duction of "Night Must Fall," in
which he was the keeper.
This job was one of three that he
turned down, Cady said, in order to
come back to Stanford for his degree
so that he might teach.
For the "Warrior's Husband,"
which will be presented Thursday,
Friday and Saturday nights, Cady
must sec that scenes get changed,
that the cast's on the stage, and un
der him are the property men and
the prompter.

"Warrior's Husband" while he pre
pares for a Master's degree that will
let him coach college theatricals, and
has his hands full of a job that makes
him responsible "for all the butches,
but none of the glory."
ACTED IN LONDON
Between his graduation and re
turn to the Farm he spent eight
months in England during the Mu
nich crisis, when war was always
"12 hours away." As bit pJayer and
understudy at the Westminster The
ater in London he appeared in
"Marco's Millions" by Eugene O'-
Neill and Schnitzler's "Farewell
Supper," and was a member of the
Phoenix Theater's permanent com
pany.
"That was a new thing," Cady said
of the Phoenix Theater. "The idea
was to have a crew of actors who
had worked together constantly, and
to give them chances to do some of
the newer plays of a higher type.
Runs were anywhere from four to
nine weeks. J. B. Priestley was a
part owner."
This was the period of his career
when he understudied 13 parts for
three plays, and threw in a 8.8.C.
television program for good measure.
And for three nights he spoke five
lines instead of two, because some
body or other was sick.
GIVES UP CAREER
With Fred Clark, former Stanford
theater favorite who introduced
"baby-killing" to the campus from
the South, Bud Cady worked out
with the well-known Brattleboro
stock company during this last sum
mer.
For seven weeks he acted, prompt
ed in live out of six productions,
later turned down a chance to play
on the road in the company's pro
duction of "Night Must Fall," in
which he was the keeper.
This job was one of three that he
turned down, Cady said, in order to
come back to Stanford for his degree
so that he might teach.
For the "Warrior's Husband,"
which will be presented Thursday,
Friday and Saturday nights, Cady
must sec that scenes get changed,
that the cast's on the stage, and un
der him are the property men and
the prompter.
The man who does everything—
that's Cady.
If you want someone to act in a
television play; understudy the stock
company's lead in, say, Brattleboro,
Vt., or London; or do offstage sound
effects with a pair of coocnuts, ask
Frank Randolph (Bud) Cady, '38,
if he will oblige. The chances are
he will.
Right now he's stage manager for
"Warrior's Husband" while he pre
pares for a Master's degree that will
let him coach college theatricals, and
has his hands full of a job that makes
him responsible "for all the butches,
