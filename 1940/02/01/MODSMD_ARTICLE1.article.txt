### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
GERMANY'S intensified U-boat
and aerial efforts toward a
"starvation blockade" against Eng
land have the Britishers worried.
Besides bidding for available Amer
ican ships to use in carrying raw
materials to the British Isles, the
government will assume, today,
complete control of Britain's vast
shipbuilding industry.
This will mean that they'll
requisition more than 9,000,000
tons of cargo liners in ;» move to
defeat the Germans. The 5,026-
ton British steamer Vaclile was
the latest victim of a German Ü
boat, which, in turn, was homhed
and sunk by a British flying boat
a few days ago. Most of the Nazi
crew, more fortunate than the
men aboard most attacked subma
rines, escaped with their lives and
were taken prisoners aboard
Hritish warships.
The crew of the Vaclite was res
cued by an Italian ship, part of the
line of convoyed merchantmen, and
some of (he survivors of the Ü
boat's crew were picked up from a
dinghy. The battle was dramatic,
unlike most annals of war. The fly
ing boat sighted the sub through
heavy clouds and, without diving,
dropped bombs. The U-boat opened
fire with its anti-aircraft gun and
the plane began machine gunning
the bout.

IV/ORLD WAR II has been fought
so largely on the sea that his
torical writers a generation from
now may call it a naval world war.
Or maybe, "when spring breaks
through again," they'll be fighting
on the western front. Bogged down
in Europe's rains and snow, they're
sitting tight in their cement-walled
dugouts right now. On the sea and
in the air they're fighting, though.
And in Finland.
The war on the sea has had
some dramatic and amusing over
tones. Aside from the little game
of military water polo off the coast
of South America during Christ
mas vacation, there have been
other headline-commanding per
formances. There was the weird
disappearance of the German liner
Bremen. Remember those news
reel pictures of the Bremen leav
ing New York harbor and sailing
away, dropping out of men's con
sciousness for those question
filled weeks? As far as I know,
(he Bremen is somewhere in some
German port now.

JF WE can believe Dr. Martin Hall,
representative of the German -
American League of Culture, who
spoke at an A.S.U. meeting not too
long ago, there was no element of
luck in the Bremen's strange odys
sey. She passed through the British
blockade lor very specific reasons.
The Bremen, you see, was insured
by Germany with an insurance com
pany of a neutral nation; the neu
tral insurance company had insured
the boat with Lloyds of London.
And, hence, the Bremen trotted
through the blockade like Kenny
Davidson or Fordy Anderson duping
the Cal cagers.
The Na/.i liner Columbus, ru
mor has it, was scuttled at Hitler's
command to collect the insur
ance money which he could con
vert into immediate buying power
for purchase of raw materials.
Five hundred of the Columbus'
crew are hanging out on Angcll
Island now, I understand. And
they're having quite a good time.
When Hitler's speech was broad
cast (he other day, half of them
listened to Der Feuhrer. The
other half, though, went bass fish
ing.
I confess that I rather envy those
people who are confined in the West
Indies for the duration of the war.
At. the expense of the ship com
pany they're having a good time. A
really good time, far away from
blackouts and anti-aircraft beacons
cutting across death-filled skies; far
away from forced drafts and uni
forms and mud and frenzied speech
es by military-mad "leaders."
