# 'Soup in a Brick' Will Be Advertising Class Subject
## 
### BUD AMES 
It was the first meeting of the National Campaigns class. The 25 stu
dents chatted while the instructor, Richard A. Russell, his back to the
class, fumbled mysteriously in a box. Suddenly he turned and tossed a
frost-covered, reddish brick on the table.
"That, gentlemen, is tomato soup," he said.

> Thus were his 25 advertising satel
lites introduced to "quick frozen
foods," the product for which they
will this quarter draw up a complete
advertising campaign. This course,
a part of the journalism department,
is given annually. Last year they
campaigned for tomato juice, the
year before for electric heaters, and
this year it's frozen foods.
REALISTIC COURSE
"Outside of forge, it's the most
realistic, matter-of-fact course at
Stanford," one of the students stated.
"You really learn advertising."
The entire class is organized like
an advertising agency with Mr. Rus
sell, who really works in a San
Francisco agency, as the directing
head. In other words, the 25 mem
bers are split into small groups, one
to do research on the product, an
other to study distribution methods,
another packaging, another — well,
this goes on for quite a way.
Though this year's class is dealing
with frozen foods, their means and
methods are typical of those used
every year. The first step is to con
tact the consumer and to find out
what he thinks about the product.
SUBMIT QUESTIONS
"We submitted questions and made
up a questionnaire," (he student
added. "Then we each took twelve
and started questioning housewives
in San Jose, San Francisco, and
Palo Alto. First you mention you're
from Stanford and that usually opens
the door. Then quick-like, you say
you're not selling anything. You'd
be surprised how many doors we get.
slammed in our faces."
Here are a couple of the sample
questions asked by the class mem
bers:
(1) Where did you first taste
quick frozen foods?
(2) Do you serve (hem mostly in
summer, or winler?
Nineteen such questions are asked
— and answered if the housewife
hasn't been frightened away by Ihe
two mimeographed pages and Ihe
demonstration cartons. Having ob
tained this necessary information, the I
students mix it with research mate
rial and ideas—and the result is the
actual written and drawn advertise
ments such as you see in the maga
zines and newspapers.
In addition, the class members de- 1
sign new cartons, decide how much
directions are necessary to guide the
buyers, decide for what class of
people their product is best suited—
and this, too, goes on for quite a
way.
Climax of the quarter's work is
the "presentation," given the owner
of the company. He is invited to
the Farm, where he is shown the
completed advertisements, the new
cartons, and all other advertising
done by the class. If he feels he
can use the advertisements, he is
given the entire campaign — for
nothing.
So look carefully at the next
frozen food advertisement you see.
It may have been born here on the
Farm.
