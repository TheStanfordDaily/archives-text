# Onesti, Ross To Play Leads In Poll Winner
## 
### 
"The Warrior's Husband," Julian
Thompson's witty, iconoclastic ver
sion of an ancient Greek legend, will
begin its Stanford run tonight at
8:15 o'clock in Memorial Hall. Re
peat performances will be given to
morrow and Saturday nights.
With Sylvia Onesti and Norman
Ross playing the comedy leads, and
Sylvia Berry and Bucky Henshaw
supplying the romantic interest, the
play retells the story of Hercules'
ninth "labor"—the one in which he
gained the magic girdle of Hippolyta,
queen of the Amazons.
TOLD AS HISTORIC JOKE
Thompson has chosen to regard
the- whole supposedly glamorous
affair as a historical joke in which
Hercules' tasks are a huge publicity
stunt staged for Homer so that he
can have material for his travel
books. In it, Hercules is a timid soul
who lets Theseus do his labors and
Homer his publicity.
The Stanford production has been
staged in a lavish and spectacular
fashion by Technical Director Wal
demar Johansen and Costume Direc
tor Helen Green. Huge, spectacular
sets and rich, colorful costumes have
been utilized to give this effect.
CHOSEN IN POLL
"The Warrior's Husband" was
chosen in a poll conducted last quar
ter by the Division of Speech and
Drama to determine just what play
the students wanted to see presented
in their theater.
In depicting the land of the Ama
zon women, Thompson has wedged
his tongue in his cheek and turned
out a satire on society which one
critic has called "one of the best
in our time." Men are the pursued
and women the pursuers in this re
versal of normal social procedure.

Drama to determine just what play
the students wanted to see presented
in their theater.
In depicting the land of the Ama
zon women, Thompson has wedged
his tongue in his cheek and turned
out a satire on society which one
critic has called "one of the best
in our time." Men are the pursued
and women the pursuers in this re
versal of normal social procedure.

peat performances will be given to
morrow and Saturday nights.
With Sylvia Onesti and Norman
Ross playing the comedy leads, and
Sylvia Berry and Bucky Henshaw
supplying the romantic interest, the
play retells the story of Hercules'
ninth "labor"—the one in which he
gained the magic girdle of Hippolyta,
queen of the Amazons.
TOLD AS HISTORIC JOKE
Thompson has chosen to regard
the- whole supposedly glamorous
affair as a historical joke in which
Hercules' tasks are a huge publicity
stunt staged for Homer so that he
can have material for his travel
books. In it, Hercules is a timid soul
who lets Theseus do his labors and
Homer his publicity.
The Stanford production has been
staged in a lavish and spectacular
fashion by Technical Director Wal
demar Johansen and Costume Direc
tor Helen Green. Huge, spectacular
sets and rich, colorful costumes have
been utilized to give this effect.
