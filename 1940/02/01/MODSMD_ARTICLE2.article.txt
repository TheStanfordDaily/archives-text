# Chamberlain Dabs Salve On Neutrals
## Prime Minister Bids To Calm U.S., Japan Wrath Over Shipping 
### 
LONDON, Jan. 31 (UP).â€”Prime
Minister Neville Chamberlain today
made a strong bid for the friendship
of neutral nations, particularly the
United States and Japan, with the
statement that their sympathies and
"ultimate interests" must lie on the
side of an Allied victory.
Adroitly attempting to calm the
outburst of neutral anger stirred by
the Jan. 20 speech of Winston
Churchill inviting the non-belliger
ents to join up with the Allies against
Germany, Chamberlain told them
they had nothing to fear from either
Britain or France.
It is Germany, he said, who
"threatens the existence of states too
small and weak or too near them"
for defiance, and the Nazis constantly
are showing "the most callous in
difference" to neutral rights.
SYMPATHIZES WITH NEUTRALS
Expressing sympathy for neutral
losses in the war at sea, Chamber
lain explained that Britain is com
pelled to take all available means of
thwarting her "powerful and utterly
unscrupulous" enemy.
Chamberlain's bid for Japan's
friendship was an almost personal
appeal to the Japanese government
and people to settle the controversy
over a British warship's seizure of
21 German seamen from the Japanese
liner Asama Maru near the Japanese
coast.
Not in a long time had such friend
ly remarks regarding Japan come
from a British government leader.
WANTS PEACE WITH JAPAN
Chamberlain said Britain wants to
"live in peace" with Japan but he
gave no hint that the 21 Gel-man
seamen would be released as de
manded by the Japanese.
He admitted the British and Jap
anese governments might disagree in
interpreting international law in the
Asama Maru incident but said that
"such issues are not the strongest
influences in the lives of nations or
the hearts of men."
JESTS ABOUT HITLER
Except for a jesting remark about
the extreme secrecy surrounding
German Chancellor Adolf Hitler's
surprise speech in the Berlin Sports
palast Tuesday night, Chamberlain
made scant reference to the German
Chancellor.
Turning to the United States,
Chamberlain asserted when the war
is ended Britain intends to begin
the reconstruction of Europe on the
basis of "our (economic) agreement
with the United States a little over a
year ago."
By that policy of reciprocal trade,
he said, Britain hopes to put an end
to the vicious policy of economic
nationalization and autarchy, which
upset the last peace settlement."
He expressed regret for the upset
in British trade with the United
States along with other neutrals as
a consequence of the war.
