# Union Plans To Reinstall Nickelodeon
## Authorities Approve Record Player Trial, Cellar Redecoration 
### 
Decision to place a nickelodeon in
the Union Cellar for a "trial pe
riod" which will extend until the
end of winter quarter was made yes
terday at a meeting of the Union
Board of Governors.
The plan received official board
approval after the reading of peti
tions signed by several hundred
Farm students urging the return of
the Cellar music machine. The
nickelodeon will be installed within
a few days.
TO INSTALL FOUNTAIN
Plans were also approved at the
meeting to install a new cellar soda
fountain, and to enlarge the serving
counter so as to allow for more
working space. The work will
probably take place during spring
vacation.
Miss Christine Ricker, director of
the Union, said yesterday that the
replacement of the soda fountain
was an absolute necessity, because
"the fountain had outlined its use
fulness."
WILL ENLARGE COUNTER
Enlargement of the counter was
planned to coincide with the re
placement of the fountain, she said.
Alterations include larger and more
convenient self - service facilities,
which will be created by cutting a
long, diagonal section from the pres
ent counter nearest the cellar back
room.
At yesterday's meeting, the board
also voted to continue using 75 per
cent of Cellar profits toward meet
ing payment on Memorial Hall for a
five-year period.
The nickelodeon which was in the
Cellar last year was removed in
June because of many complaints
that it was "too noisy," A.S.S.U.
President Ken Cuthbertson said.
Cuthbertson stated that last year
the machine cut into the Cellar
profits because many persons object
ed to the music during meals.
QUIET AT MEALTIME
In an attempt to rectify this dif
ficulty, quiet hours extending from
11:30 to 2 o'clock, and 5:30 to 8
o'clock, have been set. During these
periods the machine will not be
played.
Suggestions and criticisms for and
against the machine will be wel
comed during the two-month trial
period. Miss Ricker said.
EARNED BIG PROFIT
The nickelodeon, which was for
merly in the Cellar, was installed in
February, 1939. During the four
month period it played for Union
occupants a profit of $237 was re
alized, according to an A.S.S.U. of
fice report.
After Excom had voted to give the
first $34.50 profits to the March of
Dimes, the remainder, amounting to
$212.50, was turned over to the
boathouse fund.
Profits realized during the present
two-month trial period will also Ik:
given to the boathouse.

The nickelodeon, which was for
merly in the Cellar, was installed in
February, 1939. During the four
month period it played for Union
occupants a profit of $237 was re
alized, according to an A.S.S.U. of
fice report.
After Excom had voted to give the
first $34.50 profits to the March of
Dimes, the remainder, amounting to
$212.50, was turned over to the
boathouse fund.
Profits realized during the present
two-month trial period will also Ik:
given to the boathouse.
Decision to place a nickelodeon in
the Union Cellar for a "trial pe
riod" which will extend until the
end of winter quarter was made yes
terday at a meeting of the Union
Board of Governors.
The plan received official board
approval after the reading of peti
tions signed by several hundred
Farm students urging the return of
the Cellar music machine. The
nickelodeon will be installed within
a few days.
TO INSTALL FOUNTAIN
Plans were also approved at the
meeting to install a new cellar soda
fountain, and to enlarge the serving
counter so as to allow for more
working space. The work will
probably take place during spring
vacation.
Miss Christine Ricker, director of
the Union, said yesterday that the
replacement of the soda fountain
was an absolute necessity, because
"the fountain had outlined its use
fulness."
WILL ENLARGE COUNTER
Enlargement of the counter was
planned to coincide with the re
placement of the fountain, she said.
Alterations include larger and more
convenient self - service facilities,
which will be created by cutting a
long, diagonal section from the pres
ent counter nearest the cellar back
room.
At yesterday's meeting, the board
also voted to continue using 75 per
cent of Cellar profits toward meet
ing payment on Memorial Hall for a
five-year period.
The nickelodeon which was in the
Cellar last year was removed in
June because of many complaints
that it was "too noisy," A.S.S.U.
President Ken Cuthbertson said.
Cuthbertson stated that last year
the machine cut into the Cellar
profits because many persons object
ed to the music during meals.
QUIET AT MEALTIME
In an attempt to rectify this dif
ficulty, quiet hours extending from
11:30 to 2 o'clock, and 5:30 to 8
o'clock, have been set. During these
periods the machine will not be
played.
Suggestions and criticisms for and
against the machine will be wel
comed during the two-month trial
period. Miss Ricker said.
