### 
Presenting (he case for Germany
in (he present European conflict,
Prince Kurt B. Zer Lippe spoke
yesterday afternoon al a closed meet
ing of the International Relations
Society.
Prince Lippe, who has no official
connection with the Nazi govern
ment but is a close friend of Fritz
Weidemann, the German consul in
San Francisco, explained the back
ground of the first World War ac
cording to his country's point of
view in older to give his audience
an understanding of his opinions on
the present situation.
The prince maintained that Eng
land, having become the gold center
of the world, kept the balance of
power by lending just so much
money first to one country and then
to another so that they became jeal
ous of each other.
Britain permitted Germany to re
cover partially after the first war,
he explained, because the former
believed Germany would clash with
Russia and thus preclude the growth
of Communism which Britain feared.
The prince recommended that
America should stay out of the
present conflict and exert her re
sources toward the building of a
"United States of the Americas"
which could some day join with a
united Europe, Asia, and Africa to
help realize the Utopia of Â«vhich
Woodrow Wilson, America's ex-
President, once dreamed.
