# New Concrete Construction Slows Up War Libe Progress
## 
### 
Hoover War Library is still going up.
Though many of the Libe's daily onlookers may often be heard (o re
mark that "they sure aren't doing much these days," or "the work is cer
tainly going'along slowly," students will have to gear themselves to the

new construction schedule.
For those who last quarter were
used to seeing steel rise in 32-foot
sections, Superintendent John Leav
ers stated yesterday thai the work
of constructing forms and pouring
concrete is a much slower-progress
ing job than steel erection.
In addition to this, rainy weather
has somewhat slowed down the con
struction schedule, though this same
rain will make for stronger con
crete. However, wooden forms have
now been removed from all levels |
up to the second floor section of
cubicles.
This whole floor will be composed
of small single-room cubicles for in- i
dividual study and research, similar!
to those on the second floor of the
Cubberly Education Building.
However, the visible concrete
work is not all that is being done at
the present time. A good part of
the steam, water, and drainage pipes
have been installed in the basement'
and first floor levels. Most of the'
first floor steel window sashes have j
been put in place.
