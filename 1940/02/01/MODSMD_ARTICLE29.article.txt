# 'Europe Faces Moral Decline,' Says Dr. Lutz
## Approach of Second Dark Ages Indicated By Attitude of Youth 
### 
Europe today is on the brink of a
a second Dark according to
Dr. Ralph H. Lutz, head of the
Hoover Library, who spoke before
the Luncheon Club in the Nitery
yesterday noon.
"Moral standards are lowering
throughout Europe," said Dr. Lutz
and he referred to the greater con
sumption of alcohol among young
people as the first sign of cultural
decline which he observed on his
European tour. He pointed to the
advance of paganism, especially in
Russia and Germany, as further in
dications of a general weakening of
moral fiber.

"If the world is to be saved, it
must be regenerated," said Dr. Lutz,
"and this must be accomplished by
a sane peace settlement."
America must have an active part
in this settlement, he said, because
its culture, despite the depression,
has increased more than any other
country's since 1920.
' We cannot permit another peace
settlement without our being there,"
Dr. Lutz said. He pointed out that
the United States is the only great
neutral power with no definite com
mitments in Europe.
