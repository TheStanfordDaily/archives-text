# Frosh Cagers Conquer Polytech Squad, 40-34
## Prosh Sparkle in Fast Tilt; Poly Ace Stars 
### DON SELBY 
Despite the brilliant efforts of Gus
Mota, PolyV Mexican forward, Stan
lord's frosh basketball team grabbed
a 40 to 34 victory over Polytechnic
High School in the Pavilion last
night.
oMta, although he was the high
point man of the game with 14 digits,
couldn't match the scoring of the en
tire frosh team, hs H. B. Lee's boys
spread their tallying chore over
seven men, none of whom made
more than nine points.
Led by Fred Linari and Jim Mc-
Caffrey, each of whom scored nine
points, ihe Papoose quintet poured
in bucket after bucket in rapid suc
cession to keep in front of their
rivals all through the game. Ed
Stamm, rangy center, started the ball
rolling with a field goal on a pivot
shot, followed by a free throw, but
Mota sunk two charity tosses and a
bucket from about eight feet out to
put the Mechanics into a 4-3 lead.
LINARI, DANA SCORE
However, Linari and then Jack
Dana hit on a pair of floor-shots to
end the frosh hoopmen into a lead
that they refused to relinquish fol'
the remainder of the battle.
Going into the second half on the
long end of a 21 to 18 score, the
frosh had to turn on the heat to stay
in front of a hustling Poly five as
Mota flipped in three consecutive
floor-shots. But Linari matched the
flashy Mexican boy basket for bas
ket, and with the aid of two field
goals by McCaffrey and Norberg,
managed to give Stanford a three
point margin as the third quarter
came to a close.
I'OLY STAR MISSES
Tiny McCubbin, who hit for 1(!
points against Commerce last week,
failed to aid the Poly cause much
tonight as far as scoring was con
cerned, but his smooth ball han
dling was one of the factors that
kept the Mechanic quintet in the
game until the very last.
The closest Poly came to catching
the frosh in the last quarter was
when they drew up to within three
points of the Card frosh at 33-36
on consecutive tallies by Mota, Dro
po and Rodmas. However, Ed Voss
and Dana potted four points be
tween them, and the frosh had an
other victory on their ledger.
NEW OFFENSE WORKS
For the frosh there was no out
standing point maker, but Jim Mc-
Caffrey, who only recently broke
into the starting line-up, played
outstanding ball, as did Linari, Nor
berg and Funabiki. Stamm and Voss
were powerhouses under the bucket.
As a team the l'rosh worked the ball
into the hole nicely for lay-in shots,
and appeared to h;tve their new of
fense well in hand.
L ist night's win gives the Papoose
quintet a record of eight victories in
nine starts, their only defeat having
been inflicted by Menlo J.C. two
weeks ago. This Saturday evening
Lee's charges get an opportunity to
run their list of wins to nine when
they tangle with Piedmont High
School at 7:30 in the Pavilion.

lord's frosh basketball team grabbed
a 40 to 34 victory over Polytechnic
High School in the Pavilion last
night.
oMta, although he was the high
point man of the game with 14 digits,
couldn't match the scoring of the en
tire frosh team, hs H. B. Lee's boys
spread their tallying chore over
seven men, none of whom made
more than nine points.
Led by Fred Linari and Jim Mc-
Caffrey, each of whom scored nine
points, ihe Papoose quintet poured
in bucket after bucket in rapid suc
cession to keep in front of their
rivals all through the game. Ed
Stamm, rangy center, started the ball
rolling with a field goal on a pivot
shot, followed by a free throw, but
Mota sunk two charity tosses and a
bucket from about eight feet out to
put the Mechanics into a 4-3 lead.
LINARI, DANA SCORE
However, Linari and then Jack
Dana hit on a pair of floor-shots to
end the frosh hoopmen into a lead
that they refused to relinquish fol'
the remainder of the battle.
Going into the second half on the
long end of a 21 to 18 score, the
frosh had to turn on the heat to stay
in front of a hustling Poly five as
Mota flipped in three consecutive
floor-shots. But Linari matched the
flashy Mexican boy basket for bas
ket, and with the aid of two field
goals by McCaffrey and Norberg,
managed to give Stanford a three
point margin as the third quarter
came to a close.
I'OLY STAR MISSES
Tiny McCubbin, who hit for 1(!
points against Commerce last week,
failed to aid the Poly cause much
tonight as far as scoring was con
cerned, but his smooth ball han
dling was one of the factors that
kept the Mechanic quintet in the
game until the very last.
The closest Poly came to catching
the frosh in the last quarter was
when they drew up to within three
points of the Card frosh at 33-36
on consecutive tallies by Mota, Dro
po and Rodmas. However, Ed Voss
and Dana potted four points be
tween them, and the frosh had an
other victory on their ledger.
NEW OFFENSE WORKS
For the frosh there was no out
standing point maker, but Jim Mc-
Caffrey, who only recently broke
into the starting line-up, played
outstanding ball, as did Linari, Nor
berg and Funabiki. Stamm and Voss
were powerhouses under the bucket.
As a team the l'rosh worked the ball
into the hole nicely for lay-in shots,
and appeared to h;tve their new of
fense well in hand.
L ist night's win gives the Papoose
quintet a record of eight victories in
nine starts, their only defeat having
been inflicted by Menlo J.C. two
weeks ago. This Saturday evening
Lee's charges get an opportunity to
run their list of wins to nine when
they tangle with Piedmont High
School at 7:30 in the Pavilion.
