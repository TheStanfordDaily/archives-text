TRIVIA—ODDS AND ENDS 1
ON TIIE SPORTING FRONT
It has always been our conten- j
lion that athletics are the great lev- j
eler. That is, the important thing in j
sports is ability, courage, and per- |
sonality, One athlete admires an- I
other because of his relationships on I
the field of combat—either as a
teammate or as an opponent. Polit- j
ical or national doctrines do not en
ter into it, it's purely a case of'
conduct in the fray.
To prove our point we quote an !
excerpt from a post card sent to !
the American Lawn Tennis Asso- j
ciation by Henner Ilenkcl. Ger- .
man Davis Cup tennis star, and j
which was printed in the latest j
issue of that organization's official {
magazine:
"Since the first days of Septem- |
ber I am at the Western frontier in j
the first lines waiting for the attack |
of Petra, Pellizza, or Charley Hare." i
The irony and hidden whimsy |
of Henkel's statement lies in the J
fact that Ilare. a British Davis I
Cupper, and Petra and Pellizza. j
French tennis aces, were great pals j
of Henkel's before the present |
war. Now the German is on one i
side of the Maginot Line fighting
the three men who are—and al- !
ways will he—his friends.
For, there can be no doubt that a |
war being fought because of the (
lust, selfishness, and ignorance of j
men who don't know what the I
word "athletics" means will never j
be able to break an admiration based .
on the competition of a tennis i
court.
Perhaps the secret to America's j
apparent indifference to the fool- |
ish, selfish slaughter being waged |
overseas lies in America's inter- !
est in athletic rivalry and its at
tendant sportsmanship and whole
some comradic.
Ii that is the reason for American j
indifference let it always be so, be- ;
cause the competition of war knows]
nothing that is clean and whole- ;
some.

Figures released yesterday by the j
Big Ten show that Chicago led all
schools in the conference in value j
of scholarships granted to athletes.
Such figures, on their face, make
it seem that Chicago was being a
hypocrite for dropping football be
cause of "a general over-empha-

sis" of the sport at other schools.
But when the situation is ana
lyzed. it is realized that if Chicago
was spending all that money on ath
letes alone the Maroons could cer
tainly have better teams. In other
words, those scholarships were
awarded not because the student was
an athlete but because of his schol
astic abilities. His being a football
player is purely coincidental to his
being a scholar.
It is possible that the Big Ten
is trying to revenge itself upon
Chicago for the latter's recent slap
at the rest of the conference in
respect to subsidizing and prose
lyting tactics?
It would seem so when such mis
leading figures are given out and
not interpreted.
Stanford employs 249 professors.
There are 147 full professors, 72 as
sociate professors, and 51 assistant
professors.

Figures released yesterday by the j
Big Ten show that Chicago led all
schools in the conference in value j
of scholarships granted to athletes.
Such figures, on their face, make
it seem that Chicago was being a
hypocrite for dropping football be
cause of "a general over-empha-

sis" of the sport at other schools.
But when the situation is ana
lyzed. it is realized that if Chicago
was spending all that money on ath
letes alone the Maroons could cer
tainly have better teams. In other
words, those scholarships were
awarded not because the student was
an athlete but because of his schol
astic abilities. His being a football
player is purely coincidental to his
being a scholar.
It is possible that the Big Ten
is trying to revenge itself upon
Chicago for the latter's recent slap
at the rest of the conference in
respect to subsidizing and prose
lyting tactics?
It would seem so when such mis
leading figures are given out and
not interpreted.
Stanford employs 249 professors.
There are 147 full professors, 72 as
sociate professors, and 51 assistant
professors.
TRIVIA—ODDS AND ENDS 1
ON TIIE SPORTING FRONT
It has always been our conten- j
lion that athletics are the great lev- j
eler. That is, the important thing in j
sports is ability, courage, and per- |
sonality, One athlete admires an- I
other because of his relationships on I
the field of combat—either as a
teammate or as an opponent. Polit- j
ical or national doctrines do not en
ter into it, it's purely a case of'
conduct in the fray.
To prove our point we quote an !
excerpt from a post card sent to !
the American Lawn Tennis Asso- j
ciation by Henner Ilenkcl. Ger- .
man Davis Cup tennis star, and j
which was printed in the latest j
issue of that organization's official {
magazine:
"Since the first days of Septem- |
ber I am at the Western frontier in j
the first lines waiting for the attack |
of Petra, Pellizza, or Charley Hare." i
The irony and hidden whimsy |
of Henkel's statement lies in the J
fact that Ilare. a British Davis I
Cupper, and Petra and Pellizza. j
French tennis aces, were great pals j
of Henkel's before the present |
war. Now the German is on one i
side of the Maginot Line fighting
the three men who are—and al- !
ways will he—his friends.
For, there can be no doubt that a |
war being fought because of the (
lust, selfishness, and ignorance of j
men who don't know what the I
word "athletics" means will never j
be able to break an admiration based .
on the competition of a tennis i
court.
Perhaps the secret to America's j
apparent indifference to the fool- |
ish, selfish slaughter being waged |
overseas lies in America's inter- !
est in athletic rivalry and its at
tendant sportsmanship and whole
some comradic.
