# Swimmers to Defend Indian Freestyle Crown Tomorrow
## 
### 
Roy Vitousek, co-captain of the swimming team, and Pete Oknmoto
will defend the Paeilie Association 50-yard freestyle swimming crown,
held by Stanford through Paul Herron of last year's freshmen, tomorrow
night at the Fairmont Hotel. The meet will draw the West Coast's best
into action. Vitousek is defending junior champion. Frosh Don Smith and

Ehrlich will supplement Vitou
| sek's work.
Saturday night the swimmers give
! the Athens Club of Oakland their
| best chance in the years of arch
| rivalry between the squads. The
Athens have never won, but unless
Stanford's power is utilized to the
Utmost, they will this time.
| "Our four-men relay team and all
j our usual first-place men will have
I to come through without a hitch,"
j Coach Nort Thornton explains. "Even
i then I can't see a better than 38 to
I 37 victory."
j A feature race will be between
; Co-Capt. Bill Weeden and his young
] brother, Al, who has broken his
J older brother's high school record,
i Al is a junior at Richmond High
' School.
Much depends upon Okumoto's
ability to handle the flashy ability of
sprinter Bob Irvine of (he Club.
Vitousek may have to swim four
events to assure victory.
