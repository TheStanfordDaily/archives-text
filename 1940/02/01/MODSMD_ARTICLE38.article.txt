# Cardinal Nine Cancels Game
## Wet Grounds Cause Diamond Rain Check 
### 
For the second time in five days,
wet grounds caused the Card base
ball team to cancel a scheduled game
yesterday. Slated to meet the Gad
dini All-Stars in a practice tilt, The
Cards found the infield of the Sunk
en Diamond too muddy for a game.
The next practice game on the list
will be against the Al Erie All-Stars,
the club that lost to the Farm nine
in the season's opener. Unless the
sun dries out the field before Satur
day, however, that game, too, will
probably be called off.
The Indians now have a record for
the 1940 season of four games
scheduled, one won, one lost, and
two rained out. If the inclement
weather continues, the team is likely
to get a slow, start in the league
competition, as the hitters won't have
had time to sharpen their batting
eyes.
A new layer of dirt was spread
on the infield of the sunken diamond
during vacation, and before it could
be rolled and raked the weather
changed.
Louis Joliet and Father Marquette
discovered the first coal reported
within the boundaries of the United
States.
