## Cobb, Eyston Ride Bikes to War Jobs

SALT LAKE CITY, Utah. Jan.
31 (UP). England's auto racing
kings John Cobb, Capt. George
Eyston and Sir Malcolm Campbell
must now confine their speed at
tempts to bicycles as Europe's war
continued to curb usual activities,
Ted Allen, secretary of the contest
board of the American Automobile
Association, disclosed.
Allen said that word received
from London showed that England's
knights of the roaring road have
been pressed into military service,
and other fields.
Capt. Eyston, who drove his
Thunderbolt to a record on the
Bonneville Salt fiats here two years
ago, is working in a military capac
ity at a British munitions plant. Sir
Malcolm Campbell is connected with
the ministry of information, and
Cobb is representing his govern
ment on somi of its engineering pur
chases in the United States, Allen
related.
"You would be interested in see
ing speed kings like Cobb and Eys
ton riding bicycles to work these
days," Sammy Davis, sports editor
of the British magazine, The Auto
car, wrote to Allen.
The war with its gasoline ration
ing that forces Cobb and Eyston to
ride bicycles will keep them out of
the racing game for some time, Allen
