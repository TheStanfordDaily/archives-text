EVER since the Division of Speech and Drama
made its debut in Memorial Hall with a
series of arty flops, it has been striving whole
heartedly, if only half successfully, to satisfy
the campus' entertainment tastes.
After trying everything from "Hippolytus" to
"Johnny Johnson," the actor-folk finally realized
that the only way to find out what the students
wanted was to ask them. The result of this
brainstorm was last quarter's drama poll, in
which "The Warrior's Husband" came out on
top.
Resolving to prove itself to the campus, the
Division immediately went to work on this pro
duction. The cast was carefully chosen, elabo
rate settings and brilliant costumes were cre
ated, and night after night was spent in painful
rehearsal. In addition, this quarter the show
was blessed with an understanding, skillful new
director.
This evening at 8:15 the Stanford student
body will have a chance to see the results of its
choice. According to all advance reports, it was
a good one, for "The Warrior's Husband" is
supposed to be the funniest play that has ever
hit the stage of Memorial Hall.
Since the campus selected the production, it
certainly bears an obligation to the Speech and
Drama crowd to take a look at what it has done.
The price of admission is reasonable, three
nights are available to see the show, and it
seems that it is going to be jvell worth the time.
If "The Warrior's Husband," the students' own
choice, fails to make a hit, Stanford's actors
might as well lock the doors of the Memorial
Theaterâ€”and hit the long, hard trail to Broad
way.
