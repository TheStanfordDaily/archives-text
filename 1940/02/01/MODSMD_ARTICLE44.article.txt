# Goodman vs. Gastritis

AMAZING are the workings of democracy.
At the close of last spring quarter the
nickel phonograph was removed from the Un
ion Cellar because a number of the patrons
complained that it interfered with their diges
tion. And it took until yesterday for the Union
Board of Governors, in response to petitions
bearing the signatures of hundreds of students,
to decide to have it reinstalled in its old spot.
Originally outlawed because swing music
interfered with the flow of gastric juices of cer
tain faculty members and graduate students
who eat regularly in the Cellar, the machine
will be back in its place within a few days.
However, in an effort to keep both dinner
eating jive-haters and coke-drinking jitterbugs
happy, the phonograph will be disconnected
during the lunch and dinner hours.
It is true that 50 per cent of the take of the
nickelodeon goes to pay off the A.S.S.U.'s debt
on the Boathouse, but at the same time the
student body is receiving 75 per cent of the
Union profits to pay for Memorial Hall.
Last year, when the machine was running at
meal times, the Cellar's trade took a tumble.
Since dinners rather than cokes are the back
bone of profits, the Associated Students would
take a worse beating if it failed to consider the
long-hairs than if it catered to the swing fans.
At least on paper, the new system looks as
if it will satisfy all parties concerned.
They can try to chew their steaks without
accompaniment. And we'll sip our cokes to
Benny Goodman.
