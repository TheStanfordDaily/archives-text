STANFORD, with its usual lethargy, is letting
another minor campus emergency drift right
on by without doing a thing about it.
Stanford's four - wheeled plutocracy is re
fusing to give the people, yes, rides back and

forth from Palo Alto. Stanford's plutocracy is
saying it is too much trouble.
What is too much trouble?
"Well," they would say, "all those directions
about where to pick people up are too much
trouble," saying it in their usual inarticulate
way. "We can't bother to figure out all that
stuff."
But what is stopping Stanford's (holy) rollers
from picking up Stanford's unmounted when
they accidentally pass them on the road?
Naturally everyone doesn't go to Palo Alto
by the same route. But everyone does pass
people looking for rides to or from the campus.
And just what is it that keeps them from
picking up these people? Are Stanford people
so stodgy that they can only stop to pick up
passengers at two places, and only at these
places if they are on the same street and in a
reasonably straight line?
It appears so. Yes, Stanford: the home of the
one-track mind.—D. J.
