SOUK GRAPES OF WRATH
I YLE BOREN is a Congressional Representative from
Oklahoma, and he has trampled out his own per
sonal vintage of wrathful grapes. His father, "whose
hair is silvery in the service of Oklahoma," was a
tenant farmer. And the Congressman offered himself
to the House of Representatives as objective evidence
that the sons of tenant farmers are fine people. This
proved, in Boren's eyes, that "The Grapes of Wrath"
is "a damnable, dirty, lying, infernal creation of a
twisted, distorted mind." Quite a sweeping proof,
isn't it?
But that isn't all the righteous Representative Boren
proved. He went on to tell his colleagues that "an
apology needs to be made by California for being
the parent of such offspring" as John Steinbeck. And,
of course, the same arguments would apply to Stan
ford, because Steinbeck is one of our alumni.
So as members of the Stanford student body I
think we all ought to write a letter of apology to Okla
homa's outraged congressman. We ought to tell him
how sorry we are that this "twisted offspring" of
ours told us all about the living conditions of Okla
homa's former tenant farmers—now known as migra
tory workers.

JOHN STEINBECK spent quite a bit of time finding
out about the poverty and filth in which hundreds
of our citizens have been living. And the facts have
since been recognized by the United States govern
ment, an attempt to remedy the misery of Mr. Boren's
pride.
How nice it would have been if everything could
have been kept strictly secret. Nice and chummy like.
Hundreds of people were trying to rear families on
dirt and a dearth of food. But that's all right. Lyle
Boren's father, the one whose hair is now "silvery,"
was once a tenant farmer. And look at Lyle now. He's
a representative in Washington, with an angry vocab
ulary. The migratory workers, if Steinbeck had just
let them suffer in peace, would undoubtedly have all
been elected to Congress.
Of course, if we assume that all respectable people
have splendid educational opportunities and com
fortable homes and plenty of food and medical care,
then Steinbeck's characters were not respectable. This
is apparently the theory on which Oklahoma's cham
pion was working. The fact that these disowned ten
ant farmers don't have all those things doesn't seem to
bother Boren. He is more concerned over his pride
than the welfare of his state's paupers.
One begins to wonder whom Oklahoma should be
ashamed of—its ex-tenant farmers or Representative
Boren. The farmers were disowned and impover
ished. But Boren is drawing a nice salary from his
state.
Maybe we need a Steinbeck Committee for the sup
port of Lyle Boren's proud name. His hair will un
questionably grow "silvery" some day, as he eloquently
ignores the facts and tramples sour grapes of wrath.
