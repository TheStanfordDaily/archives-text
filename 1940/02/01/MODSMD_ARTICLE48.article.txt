# FOUR-STAR PRODUCTION
## 
### 
r JMIE EDITOR, SIR:
I have just shot scenes from the final dress re
hearsals of "The Warrior's Husband." This show will,
in my opinion, be the greatest production the Stanford
theater has presented.
The show is beautifully costumed and the sets are
excellently designed thanks to the skilled efforts of
Helen Green and Waldemar Johansen. Director Strick
land, working under splendid co-operation of the ac
tors and staff, has produced a show packed with
actors whose clever lines and acting will "bring
down the house" with laughter.
Frankly, in the three years that I have been photo
graphing plays in the Memorial Theater, I have never
had the privilege of shooting any show of such high
caliber as "The Warrior's Husband" promises to be.
The Stanford students selected this play, and if
every Stanford student doesn't see this show at least,
one night, they'll not only be betraying the faith of
the Speech and Drama group, but they'll miss a night
of laughs and entertainment they'll never forget.
I'll guarantee if everyone will take time out to see
this show, they'll get their biggest 50 cents worth of
entertainment.
Sincerely yours,
Howard E. Roberts, '39
