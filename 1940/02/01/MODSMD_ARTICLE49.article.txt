# ENCINA ALUMNI SPEAK
## 
### 
r EDITOR, SIR:
There are several statements in order regarding
the campus opinion by "An Encinaman" about the food
at Encina Commons.
1. Although it is unadvertised, visitors are allowed
to eat at Encina Commons free. We have seen them.
2. If the hominy in question had been tainted, it is
reasonable to assume that everyone who had eaten it
would have become affected but' this is contrary to
fact.
3. You can please some of the people some of the
time; you can't please all of the people all of the time;
and some people are just downright unreasonable.
4. Before "An Encinaman" makes public the fa
mous Encina secret recipe for meat loaf, he might at
least first ask someone who knows.
5. "An Encinaman" should, if he wants conditions
improved, take his ideas to the person who will do
the improving if any is in order.
