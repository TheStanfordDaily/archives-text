# Foreign Pressmen Reveal Inside Story on Europe
## 
### 
"TIIE INSIDE STORY," edited by Robert Spiers Benjamin, on sale at
the Stanford Bookstore.
The members of the Overseas Press Club of America, whose members
evidently felt impelled to rush into print their innermost secrets, have done
so. Their mentor, guide, and editor, the above mentioned Mr. Benjamin, is

evidently no D'Artagnan of the
pencil, judging from the mass of un
related nature of the book's con-1
tents.
That is somewhat of a fine point ;
to put upon a very respectable col- i
lection of foreign correspondents'
own "best stories" but the fact re- '
mains that the trend of the stories
would at the outset seem to hinge
on the events relating to the Euro
pean situation.
KALTENBORN GOOD
So, it's somewhat of a mild shock I
to get a modest diatribe regarding
John L. Lewis and the Latin Amer
ican nations' Communistic attitudes
toward socialization of industry,
which, if it contains the germ of a
news story, this hungry critic will
eat the book from cover to cover
without mustard.
The good chapters are: "Radio
Goes to War," by CBS news analyst
H. V. Kaltenborn; "The February
Fascists," by Harvardman Hal Lehr
man, and lastly, "War Without Mus
solini," by United Press ace Tom i
Morgan.
Kaltenborn's story is good be
cause Kaltenborn himself is good;
his discussion of the radio as a fac
tor in news casting is concise, well
thought out, yet vital. "The Feb
ruary Fascists" is colorful, exciting, j
yet imbued with no pretentious
pseudo-significant news value. And
"War Without Mussolini" really has j
some merit, with its new light on the !
oft-discussed Rome-Berlin Axis.
INCLUDES FEATURES
On what the editor self-conscious
ly calls "the distaff side" there is a
melancholy rehash of I'afTaire Simp
son and the Prince of Wales, by
Carol Weld, some interesting rem
iniscences on the English suffrag
ettes by Irene Kuhn, and a beauti
fully written human interest story
on the "Jobless Queens of Europe,"
by Mary Knight.
Also, there is a too utterly precious
feature by Cornelius Vanderbilt,
who, it seems, lost $1600 at cards
once, the rakehell. â€”Littleboy
