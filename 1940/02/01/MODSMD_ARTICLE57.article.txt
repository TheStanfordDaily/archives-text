Barrett F. McFaden, associate
professor of accounting in the Grad
uate School of Business, discussed
"Public Interest in Corporate Finan
cial Statements" last night on the
Stanford University Hour over KGO.
He explained that most people
have savings invested in corpora
tions at least in some indirect man
ner such as through insurance or
bank deposits. Professor McFaden
added that simplifications in finan
cial statements which have resulted
irom public pressure are likely to
continue.
Approximately 2,Gf)0,000,000 dozen
eggs are produced in the United
States annually. This amounts to
224,000 carloads, of 400 cases each.
