# 'Dime March' Drive Totals Over $250
## Paralysis Campaign Draws Seven Times Last Year's Record 
### 
By late last night $250.43 marched
into the Stanford paralysis aid col
lection, according to Alpha Phi
Omega "March of Dimes" Chairman
A1 Nadcau.
Key points on the campus and
collections from Encina, Roble, and
Lagunita totaled $200, and the bal
ance came from the 56 other boxes
placed in fraternities, sororities, and
clubs.
Beating last year's total of $34.50
by over seven times, l!)40's "March
of Dimes" saw 18 living groups con
tribute 100 per cent to the drive.
Goal of the drive was $400 â€”a dime
from every student in school.
This money will be turned over to
state officials tonight or tomorrow
night in an official ceremony, ac
cording to Kirby Low, treasurer.
Two of the three collecting cans
reported stolen Tuesday night have
reappeared, according to a state
ment issued yesterday by A1 Na
deau, chairman of the drive.
An employee of the Library had
put these cans in a back room for
the night, and the A.P.O. heads con
cluded that they had been stolen.
DETECTION DIFFICULT
"The drive boxes in front of the
post office have definitely been
stolen, though," he said. "Although
the loss will only be about $5, we're
doing all we can to find who did it."
Because the box was taken dur
ing the night, when there is nobody
near the post office, it will be hard
to do any effective detective work,
Nadeau said.
"We've checked with the post of
fice authorities, but that's about all
we can do for the present," he de
clared.
