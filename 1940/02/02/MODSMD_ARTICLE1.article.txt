### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
A COMMON and curious case came
up before California's Supreme
Court a few days ago. It involved
what the defendants liked to call
"freedom of the press," a phrase
much bandied about. Actually, the
whole issue was a matter of clear
cut, open-and-closed legality. And
the defendants were ruled guilty on
three of five counts.
The Supreme Court affirmed
three contempt convictions against
the Los Angeles Times for alleged
prejudicial editorials. It reversed
the Superior Court on two other
similar convictions. The Times
case has been hanging fire now for
a good many months, loudly pro
tested by Publisher Harry Chand
ler. The action was originated by
Secretary J. Lewis Elkin of the
Los Angeles County Bar Associa
tion in protest against editorials
which dealt mainly with Los An
geles labor matters. Five convic
tions were returned in the court
of Superior Judge Emmctt Wilson
and the matter was taken to the
State Supreme Court.
* * *
r | I HE state split, 4-2, in the decision;
Associate Justices Jesse W. Cur
tis, Jesse W. Carter, John W. Shenk,
and John F. Pullen signed the ma
jority opinion upholding the three
convictions. Associate Justices Phil
S. Gibson and Douglas L. Edmonds
returned dissenting opinions, hold
ing for reversal of all five convic
tions.
The result was that the Times
was fined $100 each on the first
two counts and $.'lOO on the third.
Managing Editor L. D. Hotchkiss
was fined $100 for the first and $50
for each of the last two, while
Harry Chandler was acquitted in
fhe first and fined $100 for each of
the last two.
The three affirmed convictions
were for editorials that the Times
printed between December, 1937,
and June, 1938. One of them com
mended the conviction of 22 sit
down strikers at the Douglas Air
craft plant before sentence was
passed. The second approved the
conviction of Erwin P. Werner and
his wife, "Queen Helen," on bribe
charges. And the third opposed
probation for two "goon squad"
members of a teamsters' union con
victed of felonous assault on truck
drivers.
>1* *
r jpilE (wo editorials on which the
convictions were reversed were
an editorial captioned "A Black
Committee Here" which pi'otested an
alleged censorship committee set up
by the Los Angeles Bar Association;
and an editorial entitled "Curious
Reasoning" which commented on the
contempt' proceedings then pending
against the Times.
In earning the court's decision,
the Times apparently violated one
of the cardinal rules of journalism
—that a writer may not comment
on decisions of trial courts before
they are released or as long as
the case may be appealed and the
criticism can he construed as an
attempt to influence the appellate
court.
* * #
The dissenting opinion said all
convictions should be reversed on
ordinary civil procedure, holding
(hat comments to be in contempt of
court must be made in the presence
of the court and must interfere with
the proceedings in some way. It
pointed out that, in the Times case,
all three of the editorials were writ
ten after the trials were concluded.

In earning the court's decision,
the Times apparently violated one
of the cardinal rules of journalism
—that a writer may not comment
on decisions of trial courts before
they are released or as long as
the case may be appealed and the
criticism can he construed as an
attempt to influence the appellate
court.

The dissenting opinion said all
convictions should be reversed on
ordinary civil procedure, holding
(hat comments to be in contempt of
court must be made in the presence
of the court and must interfere with
the proceedings in some way. It
pointed out that, in the Times case,
all three of the editorials were writ

A COMMON and curious case came
up before California's Supreme
Court a few days ago. It involved
what the defendants liked to call
"freedom of the press," a phrase
much bandied about. Actually, the
whole issue was a matter of clear
cut, open-and-closed legality. And
the defendants were ruled guilty on
three of five counts.
The Supreme Court affirmed
three contempt convictions against
the Los Angeles Times for alleged
prejudicial editorials. It reversed
the Superior Court on two other
similar convictions. The Times
case has been hanging fire now for
a good many months, loudly pro
tested by Publisher Harry Chand
ler. The action was originated by
Secretary J. Lewis Elkin of the
Los Angeles County Bar Associa
tion in protest against editorials
which dealt mainly with Los An
geles labor matters. Five convic
tions were returned in the court
of Superior Judge Emmctt Wilson
and the matter was taken to the
State Supreme Court.

convictions. Associate Justices Phil
S. Gibson and Douglas L. Edmonds
returned dissenting opinions, hold

The result was that the Times
was fined $100 each on the first
two counts and $.'lOO on the third.
Managing Editor L. D. Hotchkiss
was fined $100 for the first and $50
for each of the last two, while
Harry Chandler was acquitted in

The three affirmed convictions
were for editorials that the Times
printed between December, 1937,
and June, 1938. One of them com
mended the conviction of 22 sit
down strikers at the Douglas Air
craft plant before sentence was
passed. The second approved the
conviction of Erwin P. Werner and
his wife, "Queen Helen," on bribe
charges. And the third opposed
probation for two "goon squad"
members of a teamsters' union con

drivers.
