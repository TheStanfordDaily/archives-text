# Syphilis Tests To Be Offered
## Free Examinations To Be Given in Gyms 
### 
Once again the health services at
Stanford will offer students free
Wassermann tests for syphilis. Ac
cording to Dr. Thomas A. Storey,
chairman, faculty committee on stu
dent health, he and his associates are
interested in finding positive react
ors who have no history of exposure
to the disease.
Under the direction of Dr. C. E.
Shephard and Dr. Helen Pryor the
tests will be given without cost to
men and women students who re
port to their respective gyms for
such purpose tomorrow between 9
and 11 o'clock.
Dr. Storey stated that these tests
are being conducted at Stanford as a
part of a national investigation under
the United States Public Health
Service.
The Wassermann tests are being
given in colleges because of the
greater opportunity of selectivity and
because there are supposedly fewer
people there who have been exposed
to syphilis. Twenty-five other uni
versities in the country have made
similar extensive studies.
