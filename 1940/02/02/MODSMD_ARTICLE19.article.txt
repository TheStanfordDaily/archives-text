# Salamander Eaters Escape Deadly Poison
## Students Describe 'Rusty' Taste, Tough Skin of Amphibians 
### BUD AMES 
At the height of last year's gold
fish-eating craze, two Stanford stu
dents, Craig Williamson and Robert
Connell, tilted back their heads,
opened their mouths and each swal
lowed a live and kicking salamander.
Death might have resulted, for just
a week ago Farm biologists made
public the discovery of a toxic poison
found in the eggs and embryos of
such California salamanders. One
gram of this toxin will kill 75,000
mice, 600 monkeys, or, roughly
speaking, about 21 men.

in a stagnant pool. I topped it off
