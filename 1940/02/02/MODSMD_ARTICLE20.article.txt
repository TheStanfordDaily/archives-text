# Bids for Prom To Sell at $3
## 
### 
The Senior Prom, slated for Feb.
IG, offers the frosh their first chance
to attend a big Stanford dance.
This dance usually must vie for
popularity with the Junior Prom,
but this year a detailed date sched
ule has postponed the latter until
spring quarter.
The fact that the prom is open to
the whole University—not just the
seniors—was emphasized yesterday
by co-Chairman Dick Wright.
TUXES RULED OUT
"You don't need a tux," he an
nounced. "The dance is semi
formal—that means formals for the
women and dark suits for the men,
unless they just have to wear tuxes."
Wright pointed out that this Val
entine Dance—two days after Feb.
14—-is a chance for freshman men
to make their debuts into Stanford's
social life.
"Grab your roommate's dark suit,
borrow his car, call one of those 250
women in Iloble, and you're all set,"
he told them.
Meeting last night, the prom com
mittee set the price of bids defi
nitely at $3. A limited number of
bids, 400, will go on sale at the
A.S.S.U. office.
14 MEN AND A GIRL'
Music for the affair will be pro
vided by Joe Reichman, "the
Panliacci of the piano, and his 14
men and a girl."
Well known to the Pacific Coast,
Reichman opens the following night
at the Mark Hopkins for his third
engagement at that hotel. He has
had two engagements at Cocoanut
Grove in Los Angeles.
Promising sweet, danceable music,
Reichman will play from 8:45 to 1
i o'clock.
