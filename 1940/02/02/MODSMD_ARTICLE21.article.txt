# Indians Take Up Rivalries With Bronco, Gael Fives In Week-end Court Series
## Kezar Pavilion Will Be Arena; Bears to Meet Bruins at Berkeley As Uclans Hope for First Victory 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Stanford's colorful basketball team temporarily leaves all thought* of
Southern Division play behind tonight and tomorrow to test their luck
against some bay college talent.
Resuming rivalries with Santa Clara and St. Mary's quintets, Coach
Everett Dean's cagers headline two San Francisco Kezar Pavilion

doubleheaders, meeting the Broncos
at 9 o'clock tonight and the Gaels in
the main wind-up tomorrow.
U.S.F. and St. Mary's open to
night's festivities at 7:30 o'clock
sharp, and then take on the Broncs
in the first tilt tomorrow. Admis
sion is 50 cents and a capacity crowd
of 8500 fans is expected for both
games.
BEARS NOT IDLE
Across the Bay the Berkeley Boars
will not be exactly idle, meeting
their now much more respected Los
Angeles brothers, the Bruins, in a
two-game series which will relegate
one of the two to the cellar. Should

the teams split it would be note
worthy for it would be the first.
Bruin victory in conference compe
tition in 31 games.
That possibility, what with Jackie
Robinson acting as a one-man outfit,
for the Bruins, is not unlikely either.
The Bears, on the other hand, rep
resent a tremendously improved
quintet and will be hard to stop
from now on in.
That's what Stanford fears, too,
especially since the Cards will travel
to the Bear gym next Friday night,
in the second of the two teams' four
important meetings. In the two
games against Santa Clara and St.
Mary's Stanford will have a fairly
good chance to see how its club
stacks up now with the Bears since
Cal met and whipped those two last
week-end..
GAME SLOW
In a slow game with the Broncos,
Cal won, 36-34, but they moved into
high scoring gear the next night,
trimming the Gaels, 54-41. The In
dians' main job will be to win as
impressively—a mean task consid
ering the fact that both opponents
have been playing outstanding ball
the past several weeks.
Stanford will start the games with
the same line-up that bowed to
U.S.C. last week—sans Fordy An
derson, first-string forward. Just
getting over the effects of the flu,
Anderson will be in top shape next
week for the Bear joust—the one
game Coach Dean really wants him
in shape for at the present moment.
With him last week the team
would have had a good chance of
winning the first game in lieu of
losing, 51-48, even though Leon La
faille and Bob Penn carried on re
markably well. Either Lafaille or
Penn, along with Don Williams at
the other forward post should make
things interesting for Bronco and
Gael guards. With Williams tied up
down South, Penn came through to
snare scoring honors for the team.
TAYLOR SURPRISES
At the pivot post will be Dick
Taylor who surprised everyone —
and himself—by scoring more points
than anyone on the squad against,
the Trojans last week. His play has
been improving from week to week
and he'll be the main cog next week
when he tries to stop Bill Ogilvie,
high-scoring Bear center, all over
again.

Students are urged to be at Ke
zar Pavilion no later (ban 7:r»0
o'clock either tonight or tomorrow
if they want to he assured of good
scats, Don Licbendorfer, B.A.C.
publicity director, said today.
