rain between now and kick-oil'
time; otherwise it will he held on
the frosh football practice field.
This will be the first tilt of t.he
season for U.S.F. The Dons claim
to have the largest and most en- j
thusiastle turnout of recent years,
and are confident they will be able

The open date last week-end has
given Coaches Jim Wylie and Harry l
Maloney an opportunity to iron out ;
several kinks that showed in the [
Cards' 6-3 victory over the Univer- j
.sily Club two weeks ago, and the |
Stanfords, who have lost only four
games in the last eight years, are
confident of adding another scalp 'â€¢
to their belts.
The Stanford B's will meet the !
Olympic Club seconds at 3:30 o'clock.

"A" team:
Backs: Gallarneau, Kmetovic, i
Austin, Rogers, McMurray, Jedenoff, j
Olden; scrum: Ugrin, Barnard, Hick- j
ingbotham (Capt.), deMailly, Pugh, I
Pierce, Morgan, Thompson.
