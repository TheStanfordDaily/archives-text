# Frosh to Meet Piedmont Five
## Chances for Victory Over Cal at Stake 
### 
With a victory over Polytechnic j
High School under its collective j
belt. Stanford's high riding frosh j
basketball team takes the floor again i
; tomorrow night to match baskets;
with Piedmont High School. The ■
game is scheduled for 7:30 o'clock j
! in the Pavilion.
Although Piedmont trimmed Hay- j
! ward in their last appearance to re- i
' tain their league leadership, they j
1 took a trouncing at the hands of the I
Cal frosh to the tune of 45 to 27. j
j All of which probably adds up to I
i Piedmont's having a good team, and j
j Cal's having a tremendous frosh ;
i outfit.
j TOUGH TIME EXPECTED
The frosh. expect to have a tough J
time with the Piedmont gang, but ;
realize that they will have to down j
the boys from across the bay if they j
; are to keep up their chances for a !
j victory over the Cal Cubs next Fri
| day night.
The Papoose squad came out of i
i Wednesday night's tussle with Poly j
I in line shape and will go into the '
I Piedmont battle at full strength. !
I Coach H. B. Lee used his reserves j
! quite a bit in the last couple of!
! games and may be able to send a j
I strong ten-man squad against the I
5 rest of the freshman team's op- !
1 * !
j ponents.
NOT HITTING HOOP
Although he wasn't hitting the
J hoop with his usual consistency
I Wednesday night, Jack Dana will
1 nrobably find his eye for tomorrow
, c ' -"'s fray. His scoring ability
means 'n the frosh squad's of
fense, but in . n oly game every
other man on the ' neppered
the basket in fine style.
Stanford will start Saturday nign*
game with the same live that opened i
the Poly contest, according to Beeb i
Lee, frosh mentor. They are Linari 1
and Dana, forwards; Stamm, center;
McCaffrey and Funabiki, guards.

NOT HITTING HOOP
Although he wasn't hitting the
J hoop with his usual consistency
I Wednesday night, Jack Dana will
1 nrobably find his eye for tomorrow
, c ' -"'s fray. His scoring ability
means 'n the frosh squad's of
fense, but in . n oly game every
other man on the ' neppered
the basket in fine style.
Stanford will start Saturday nign*
game with the same live that opened i
the Poly contest, according to Beeb i
Lee, frosh mentor. They are Linari 1
and Dana, forwards; Stamm, center;
McCaffrey and Funabiki, guards.
Fifteen to 20 per cent of the J
weight of a fowl is lost in dressing i
With a victory over Polytechnic j
High School under its collective j
belt. Stanford's high riding frosh j
basketball team takes the floor again i
; tomorrow night to match baskets;
with Piedmont High School. The ■
game is scheduled for 7:30 o'clock j
! in the Pavilion.
Although Piedmont trimmed Hay- j
! ward in their last appearance to re- i
' tain their league leadership, they j
1 took a trouncing at the hands of the I
Cal frosh to the tune of 45 to 27. j
j All of which probably adds up to I
i Piedmont's having a good team, and j
j Cal's having a tremendous frosh ;
i outfit.
j TOUGH TIME EXPECTED
The frosh. expect to have a tough J
time with the Piedmont gang, but ;
