# Card-Athens Club Meet Promises Tough Battle For Farm Swim Team
## 
### 
Coach Nor! Thornton will have to do a good joh of utilizing tomorrow
night at Oakland if Stanford's win-monopolizing swimming policy toward
the Athens Club is to he continued.
For when the squads meet tomorrow night at o'clock, the Athens
Club will have its best chance in all its years of unsuccessful trying.

Tonight Roy Vitousek, Pete Oku
motor, Don Smith, and Bill Ehrlich
will defend Stanford honors in the
senior and junior divisions of the Pa
cific Association meet at Fairmont
Hotel plunge in San Francisco.
SHIFTS IN RELAY TEAM
Tomorrow night's meet will see
some fancy shifting by Coach
Thornton which will probably have
much to do with the outcome. Things
depend a good deal upon the ability
of the relay team to come
through. As wasn't the case last
week, the medley trio will also be
pressed. To remedy this Vitousek
will replace Lloyd Wilson in the
breaststroke. But this will put the
pressure on Okumoto in the free
style dashes.
Okumoto- is expected either to
beat or come awfully close to the
Athens freestyle man, Bob Irvine,
in the 50. But the latter will be
favored in the 100 and Vitousek,
stronger at the event than Okumoto,
will probably take over.
FACE TOUGH COMPETITION
Vitousek will also carry the bur
den in the 200-yard breaststroke.
Howie Adams will be pressed to
the limit in the diving event, and a
loss here would also be* enough to
hand the Athens team the meet.
A race between Bill Weeden and
his brother Al, a junior in high
school, will be another feature. Ai
has bettered Bill's prep mark.
