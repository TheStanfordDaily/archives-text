TO those who have been complaining of the
one-sidedness of the British and French
speakers to be featured on the Lecture Series
it must be gratifying to know that an uncom
promising proponent of the German cause spoke
on the campus this week.
Free to express himself candidly at a closed
meting, Prince Kurt B. Zer Lippe had no qualms
about presenting an unvarnished Nazi view of
the European picture. Although he has no offi
cial connection with the Hitler government, no
one who attended the meeting was allowed any
doubt as to where his sympathies lie.
Prince Lippe is only one of a number of
speakers who present their views on world
shaking, controversial issues at closed meetings
of the International Relations Society. A closed
session signifies that only members and their
guests may attend. But since any student is
eligible for membership, actually nobody is ex
cluded from the meetings.
Because of the nominally private nature of
the assemblies, the University is relieved of all
responsibility for what the speakers say, and
communists, fascists, laborites, economic royal
ists, pacifists, and militarists frankly can speak
their minds without any kind of censorship.
An organization of tihis kind, one that is open
to every Stanford student and presents men of
all conflicting views, is an extremely valuable
institution in any university. There are a great
many administrations which will not permit such
freedom of the rostrum, even in private sessions.
However, despites its critics' accusations that
Stanford can see only the Republican side of
every question, the Administration will allow
any party to express its views for the benefit
of the students on this campus.
Hitler and Stalin and Harry Bridges all would
be welcome here —just so long as the University
would not have to be responsible for what they
might say.
