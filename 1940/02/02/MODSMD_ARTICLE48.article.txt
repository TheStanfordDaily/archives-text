# A 						Worth-While Service

### 
TIME was when the word "syphilis" was con
fined to medical usage, when the public
would not dream of uttering the ugly syllables.
Even though a cure had been discovered at the
beginning of the century, attempts to stop the
killer were unavailing, simply because no one
would admit that he had contracted the disease.
But this is 1940, and tomorrow, as a result of
the campaign to "popularize" the treatment of
syphilis, Stanford will assume an important part
in the nation-wide fight against the scourge.
Data as to how freguently the Wassermann
test for syphilis gives a positive reaction when
there is no record of previous exposure to the
disease are needed. The accuracy of this test
for use on the general public can be increased
if these data are available.
To get the information, the United States Pub
lic Health Service is sponsoring the administra
tion of the test in 25 universities. College stu
dents have been chosen for the tests because
their record of exposure is extremely low.
Tomorrow, between 9 and 11 o'clock, any
student who desires to take the test may report
to the men's or women's health services for the
few minutes that the test reguires.
Stanford will act as guinea pig for the nation,
and another important step toward the eventual
eradication of syphilis will be taken.â€”J. B.
