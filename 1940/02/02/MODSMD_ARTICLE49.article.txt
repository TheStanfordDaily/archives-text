# Look Out for Bridges

THE average college basketball schedule will
include anywhere from 25 to 40 games. That
means that an institution with any kind of ac
commodations should offer approximately half
of that number for student body consumption.
A first-rate team with first-rate facilities could
get as many as three-fourths of their series in
their own backyard.
Stanford has the first-rate team and a first
rate schedvle. But the local Pavilion handles the
crowds in about the same way that a two-seat
calaboose would serve the purpose in a crime
swept metropolis.
Despite the apparent need for better basket
ball housing, the Board of Athletic Control has
been unable to provide it. Except when angels
like Luisetti come along, the maple game —like
most other sports-—depends on football revenue.
If the new coaching regime and simon-purity
in the Conference does anything, perhaps
the Board can remedy the situation before the

present barn explodes under the impact of a
Big Series yelling bee.
We of the present generation, however, must
take what we can get. And that, for one reason,
is why we are playing Santa Clara and St.
Mary's in San Francisco tonight and tomorrow.
Both games are likely sell-outs and might pay
a small portion of the expenses incurred by the
team on their Eastern invasion.
Likewise, the general public must not be
denied its few glimpses of our Indian sports
sguads. The Bay Bridge to Berkeley's giant
pavilion and the cheap rent of the Kezar arena
are two little items that make a 32-mile trip down
the death-trap Bayshore an unnecessary form of
relaxation.
Anyhow, this might sound like a logical ex
planation for the schedule maker's slight. But,
if money is the real object, why not play all
four of the California series in San Francisco's
Civic Auditorium? Then maybe Stanford bas
ketball could reverse the traditional procedure
and support football.
However, no matter where we play them, the
fact remains that the Broncos and Gaels beat us
on successive nights last year.
A little revenge might be in order.—A. J.
