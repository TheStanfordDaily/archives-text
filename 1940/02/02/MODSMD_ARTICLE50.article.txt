### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
BROTHER RAT
YV/ILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST'S northern repre
sentative, The San Francisco Examiner, ran one
of those sensational cartoons yesterday. It showed a
rather ugly, sweating rat who was tremendously
grieved to read that the Dies Committee had been
given funds for another year. The Dies Committee
is bad news, the Hearstling explains, "for those who
gnaw at the foundations of democracy. Only traitors
and foes of this nation wanfed to see the expose of
treason halted. Their vicious hopes are disappointed.
There we have a typical Hearstian humbug. The
words themselves are patriotic, if a little melodramatic,
but the meaning is as false and malicious as a long list
of Willy Randolph's public hoaxes.
While on the subject of "those who gnaw at the
foundations of democracy," we could very well take
Hearst as a living definition. He colored and twisted
the news to get us into the Spanish-American War.
He publicized forged documents in an attempt to dis
credit United States senators who opposed our pre-
War fight with Mexico. He published articles by fake
ex-Communists in an effort to brand liberal college
professors as "Reds."
And this list could go on through every sort of
cowardly deceit. It could go on through shifting polit
ical stands and the most amazing of journalistic gym
nastics. As one of his biographers puts it, the bogus
Mr. Hearst has been consistent in only one respect:
He has consistently been for Hearst.

A ND YET with the shameless gall that has always
characterized America's genius of yellow journal
ism, Hearst never tires of calling other people (pref
erably progressive ones) "rats who gnaw at the founda
tions of democracy." His eternal branding of other
people as social traitors really tells us more about
Hearst than it does about the other people.
His support of the Dies Committee is a case in
point. For months Martin Dies has disgusted the na
tion by totally unfounded slandering of public fig
ures ranging from Rockwell Kent to Shirley Temple.
With an eye for publicity and apparently unscrupu
lously truth-blind, Dies has flooded the market with
unproved accusations. But he has succeeded in feed
ing the Hearst-sponsored phobia against anyone more
liberal than the Daughters of the American Revolution.
Samuel Insull, the utilities magnate whose holding
companies sacked the savings of thousands of invest
ors, used to tell his propaganda agents, "Don't argue
with those who oppose you; just call them Reds."
Hearst and Dies don't believe in presenting any rea
sonable or provable arguments either. They just call
people "gnawing rats."
The country might very well nominate Hearst and
Dies for president and vice-president of the Public
Rodent. Society. Or else we might significantly send
each of them a large piece of cheese.
