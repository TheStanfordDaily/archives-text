# AND HE GOES TO STANFORD!
## 
### 
r PHE EDITOR, SIR:
One of the most, obnoxious traditions recently
given much space in this column, is that of running
"taxi service" gratis to students commuting from Palo
Alto. There are several reasons why I think this cus
tom should be taken with a grain of salt.
1. The person receiving the lift takes it. as a matter
of course, and manifests no appreciation whatsoever.
2. Should an accident occur, nine times out of ten
the driver will be sued by his ungrateful guest.
3. The tradition causes boundless inconvenience.
God knows that traffic is bad enough on University
Avenue without the jams resulting from retardation
of vehicles to pick up "our unfortunates."
4. Guests, even though unknowingly, scrape mud
and flick ashes on one's floor and upholstery. This is
especially trying in wet weather. Some of these stu
dents have the infernal crust to bum a cigarette, per
haps the driver's last one.
Stanford is a school which, catering to none, fosters
the development of self-reliance and individuality. No
student, should come to Stanford who cannot provide
himself with adequate means of transportation. He
forces himself upon others .and creates a literal burden
to those who are self-reliant and have been thoughtful
enough to provide their own transportation.
Sincerely yours,
"'4O living in Paly"
