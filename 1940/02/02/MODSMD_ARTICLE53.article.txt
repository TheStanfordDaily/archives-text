# NECKTIE PARTY
## 
### 
r pilE EDITOR. SIR:
Perhaps it. would be worth while to find just
what the Farm was like at the time the "Back to the
Farm Week" suggests, I am under the impression that
neckties were worn on the Farm twenty years ago, and
that to appear without one was very, very bad.
Sincerely,
R. B. M.
