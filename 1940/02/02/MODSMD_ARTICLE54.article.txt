# Timeworn 'Swanee River' Saved by Foster Ballads
## 
### 
"SWANEE RIVER." now playing at the Fox Stanford.
Twentieth-Century Fox, not to be outdone by the rest of Hollywood's
major studios, presents to its public a combination salad of overworn
senitinental gufT, generously seasoned with the best of Stephen Foster's

songs.
By far the best of the current mu
sicals, "Swanee River" is a beauti
fully done bit of music and drama
despite the fact that the plot is time
worn and despite the fact that the
writers took license with the true
life of "America's troubador."
In the role of the famous composer,
mellow-voiced Don Ameche turns in
a delicately rounded and sensitive
performance. His voice was per
fectly suited to such songs as "My
Old Kentucky Home" and "I Dream
of Jeanie with the Light Brown
Hair."
JOLSON COMES BACK
A1 Jolson makes a comeback as
the minstrel singer who sings the
Foster songs that Ameche misses.
His natural hammy manners are
heavily taxed. He was right at home
in blackface, making it the minstrel
man A1 Jolson. not the minstrel-man
as played by A1 Jolson.
The script writers concentrated so
much on the characters of Foster
and the minstrel singer, that they
ran out of material when they came
to the part of Foster's wife, Jean.
Andrea Leeds did the part, well, but
didn't have much to do. Incidentally,
she should always be cast in Tech
nicolor pictures.
NEGRO VOICES
Special mention is due to the Hall
Johnson Choir, a choir of negro
voices that added much to the bal
lads of Foster.
Also on the double feature is a
little epic called "The Honeymoon
Is Over," which is guaranteed to put
the most energetic "rough" into a
disturbed slumber.â€”Sprager
