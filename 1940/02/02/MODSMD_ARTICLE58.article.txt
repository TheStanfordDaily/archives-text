# Smoking Statistics Not Yet Available
## 
### 
Because the committee in charge
has not completed tabulating the
answers on the smoking survey
questionnaires, statistics on the
number of students who do and who
do not smoke on campus are not yet
available, Dwight Zook, chairman of
the business graduates who are con
ducting the poll, declared yesterday.
As an exercise in gathering and
interpreting statistics, 100 members
of the Graduate School of Business
distributed questionnaires Monday
concerning the extent of smoking on j
campus. Dick Hall is in charge of I
the survey, which is being directed 1
by Professor Robert Martine of the
Business School.

There is one student from each of
the following foreign countries at
Stanford this quarter: Central
America, Eire, Hungary, Norway,
South Africa, and Switzerland.
