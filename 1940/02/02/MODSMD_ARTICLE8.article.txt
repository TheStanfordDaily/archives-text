# Warrior's Husband Insures Stanford Dramatic Future
## 
### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
A line of people stood outside the hox office of Memorial Hall last night
as the curtain went up on Julian Thompson's "Warrior's Husband," the
inaugural attempt of Stanford's hewly revamped Division of Speech
and Drama.
And, if what they saw when they finally secured seats indicates the

future of Farm dramatics, they may<
well expect entertainment that will
keep week-end crowds away from
the flicker palaces of Palo Alto and
the Geary "white-way" of San
Francisco. For Stanford's produc
tion of "The Warrior's Husband," di
rected by F. Cowles Strickland and
acted by a cast of 30 (mostly wom
en), was what Stanford liked to see.
It was a damn good show.
A lusty, blustering comedy that
kept the audience chuckling, laugh
ing, or sitting on the edge of its
scats for the gags, "Warrior's Hus
band" is strong on sex. Only this
time the sexes are reversed, and the
resulting situation is a natural.
MEN ACT LIKE WOMEN
There's something basically comic
about men acting like women and
women imitating men. When a good
playwright dreams up a neat com
edy, you can nearly always count
on Sex as an important theme. This
time the "character-reversal" trick
makes it the dominant theme.
This is the humor of a strange,
upside-down world, a burlesque of
Aristophanes, a slight fantasy with
searchlight perception. The world
of "Warrior's Husband" is complete
ly unreal—so unreal that it, by its
very incongruity, holds up a mirror
to a modern world which, too, wc
discover, is strange and confused.
ONESTI IS STANDOUT
Sylvia Oncsti as the Amazon
queen. Hippolyta, was easily the
standout character in a cast that
maintained a uniformly high level.
She swashbuckled just the right
amount; she blustered in the proper
spots; and her interpretation
squeezed every ounce of meaning
from the lines that Johnson had
given her.
Your week-end's entertainment
