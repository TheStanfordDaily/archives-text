# Warrior's Husband Insures Stanford Dramatic Future
## 
### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
A line of people stood outside the hox office of Memorial Hall last night
as the curtain went up on Julian Thompson's "Warrior's Husband," the
inaugural attempt of Stanford's hewly revamped Division of Speech
and Drama.
And, if what they saw when they finally secured seats indicates the

future of Farm dramatics, they may<
well expect entertainment that will
keep week-end crowds away from
the flicker palaces of Palo Alto and
the Geary "white-way" of San
Francisco. For Stanford's produc
tion of "The Warrior's Husband," di
rected by F. Cowles Strickland and
acted by a cast of 30 (mostly wom
en), was what Stanford liked to see.
It was a damn good show.
A lusty, blustering comedy that
kept the audience chuckling, laugh
ing, or sitting on the edge of its
scats for the gags, "Warrior's Hus
band" is strong on sex. Only this
time the sexes are reversed, and the
resulting situation is a natural.
MEN ACT LIKE WOMEN
There's something basically comic
about men acting like women and
women imitating men. When a good
playwright dreams up a neat com
edy, you can nearly always count
on Sex as an important theme. This
time the "character-reversal" trick
makes it the dominant theme.
This is the humor of a strange,
upside-down world, a burlesque of
Aristophanes, a slight fantasy with
searchlight perception. The world
of "Warrior's Husband" is complete
ly unreal—so unreal that it, by its
very incongruity, holds up a mirror
to a modern world which, too, wc
discover, is strange and confused.
ONESTI IS STANDOUT
Sylvia Oncsti as the Amazon
queen. Hippolyta, was easily the
standout character in a cast that
maintained a uniformly high level.
She swashbuckled just the right
amount; she blustered in the proper
spots; and her interpretation
squeezed every ounce of meaning
from the lines that Johnson had
given her.
Your week-end's entertainment
safely provided for by the Division
of Speech and Drama, you'll like
Bucky Henshaw in his first grown
up role. It's a solid, sympathetic
part that he handles with skill and
genuine artistry. As Theseus the
Warrior, he's all that the part de
mands.
Sylvia Berry was consistent as
the Amazon princess, Antiope. Never
once during the performance did
she relax into Americansms, as some
of the other members of the cast
did. Her portrayal was excellent
in every way, rivaling the interpre
tation of Hippolyta by Sylvia Onesti.
MUHEIM PLUGS HOMER
Norman Ross as Sapiens took
good care of a tough part; Sapiens
Major, Garrett Starmer, was a riot
by virtue of mere costuming. Harry
Muheim with his Bronx accent
plugged Homer, "publicity man of
antiquity," to the limit —if some
what unconventionally. Ineffectual
Hercules, the object of Homer's
blurb-writing, was gagged along
neatly by Charley Bulotti. Dan Hol
tom nearly went to pieces as Achil
les, but bore up well enough to fin
ish. And a flock of newcomers gave
life and freshness to the whole
affair.
Ponposia was disappointingly
weak as played by Mary Margaret
Roth. Louise Goldman, Jean Now
ell, Jane Harrington, Nancy Buiv
kett, Jane Harrington, Nancy
Behlke, Jean Pennington, and sev
eral other members of the Amazon
crew filled small speaking-roles
handily.
A new round of applause greeted
each act as the audience expressed
approval of Waldemar Johansen's
magnificent staging.
JOHANSEN NEVER FAILS
In scores of Memorial Hall produc
tions, Johansen has never turned in
a dud. His skill at designing and
executing the gay, garish settings of
the first act, the straightforward,
simple second-act backgrounds, and
the broad, loftily-draped interior
for the last act exhibited the wealth
of talent and artistry at his com
mand. Costuming was a major task
and was "spectacularized," Cecil B.
deMille-like, by Helen Green.
The whole goings-on was directed
by F. Cowles Strickland, who comes
to Stanford with a background in
the professional theater that equals
that of any director in the country.
If his first Farm show is any indica
tion of the things that are to follow
during his reign as sub-chief to
Hubert Heffner, this section of the
Peninsula is lucky. "Warrior's
Husband" will continue to amuse
full houses, probably, tonight and
tomorrow night—from 8:15 to 10:30
o'clock.
