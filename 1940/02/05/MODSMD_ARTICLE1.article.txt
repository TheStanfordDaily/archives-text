vision of Balkan unity that
has seemed, during the past two
decades, so near to realization is
doomed.
Once again the four members of
the famous Balkan Entente—only
existing accord styled expressly for
the defense of small powers—are
forsaking their alliance, turning in
stead to their own devices for keep
ing out of Europe's second World
War.

From Belgrade, where the for
eign ministers of Yugoslavia, Ru
mania, Turkey, and Greece, arc
finishing an Entente conference,
comes confirmation to the steadily
growing belief throughout the
world that their national interests
are too strongly divergent ever to
allow extension of their anti-Bul
garian agreement to an iron-bound
decision to steer clear of Europe's
battles.
The much-touted Yugoslav-Ru
manian plan for "economic neutral
ity" is abandoned. At least all the
teeth have been removed from the
proposed agreement. And the Bal
kans, considered for a moment as on
the road to unity, are once more the
intensely nationalistic "powder keg
of Europe."

jyiEAN WHILE, Russia and Ger
many arc making cats-eyes at
the southeastern part of Eui'ope.
And Pravda, Communist party
paper, accuses England and France
of seeking to establish a new war
front against Germany by diplo
matic maneuvering down there.
Germany publicly declares that she
will pursue a "hands-off" policy in
the Balkans. "We're only interested
in seeing that peace is preserved in
the Balkan countries," she says.
At this point it will take some
thing like a first rate heavenly dis
pensation to preserve any sem
blance of unity in these small,
independent nations. The literal
boundary of western and eastern
culture, they're holding to their
usual unpredictable course. In
this strange, frothing mixture of
the Orient and the Occident, com
binations shift over night and po
litical stability is an expression
that inspires laughter. It may be
that the Balkans are govern
mentally naive. In nearly every
instance of strife and disagreement,
they've been beset by European
nations seeking political or eco
nomic concessions. Any trouble
that has come to southeastern Eu
rope has come over the mountains
from northern and central Eu
rope.

when the Balkans proclaim
k their vain but noble desire to
stay out of the Continent's problems,
they're whistling by the graveyard
in the dark. They'd like to handle
their own small affairs in their own
small way, but they'll never be per
mitted to do that.
Yugoslavia is already in close
co-operation with Hungary and
ISulgaria, and all three are under
the sway of Mussolini's Italy. Old
line friend of England, Greece is
playing a consistent game with
the British in co-operation with
another British ally, Turkey. A
new English-Turkish trade agree
ment has just been signed, modi
fying and enlarging one that was
approved in 1936.
Rumania, afraid of Hungarian and
Russian attempts at "territory-grab
bing," is pinning her hopes on Ger
many. The Nazis have promised
that they'll protect Rumania—at a
price. That, price is a guarantee of a
lai-ge contract for oil and other raw
commodities with the Germans. The
Nazis need those supplies fi'om
southeastern Europe. And they'll go
to some lengths to insure the steady
exchange of goods with Rumania.
