### 
WASHIJNUTUIN, *eD. 4 (Urj. â€”
Chairman John D. M. Hamilton of
the Republican National Committee
tonight blasted in the same breath
the Russian regime and the Ameri-
I can Youth Congress which Mrs.
i Franklin D. Roosevelt has defended
against charges of Communism.
He described Soviet policy as "im
moral, imperialistic and autocratic"
! and announced that he would not
' assign a Republican speaker to a
forthcoming AYC meeting because
!of the organization's failure to
I "purge" allegedly Communistic
I groups from its ranks.
HAMILTON INVITED
The twin attack was contained in
j a letter to Joseph Caddcn, executive
secretary of the AYC, who had in
vited Hamilton to send a represen
tative of the GOP to the youth
| group's session on civil liberties and
! citizenship which will be conducted
here next Sunday.
"Until the American Youth Con
gress purges itself of its Commun
istic elements which, according to
the Dies Committee (on un-Ameri
| can activities) dominate it, I shall
J not request any Republican to at
tend a meeting of your organiza
tion," Hamilton wrote.
MEMBERS ABSOLVED
He absolved some of the AYC's
I member organizations from Com
munistic charges, saying thai. "I do
not mean in any way to reflect on
the several very fine and really
American organizations of youth af
filiated with the American Youth
Congress."
Besides a number of purportedly
j Communist or Communist "front"
| organizations, the AYC's affiliates
1 include the Young Men's Christian
| Association, the Young Women's
j Christian Association, various church
' youth organizations and college
! groups.
