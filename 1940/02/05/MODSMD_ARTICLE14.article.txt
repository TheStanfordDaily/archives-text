survey of library calls and includes
"House Beautiful," "Mademoiselle,"
"Vogue," "Harper's Bazaar," "Ladies
Home Journal," "Colliers," "Lib
erty," "Cosmopolitan," "Red Book,"
and "Woman's Hume Companion."

Sixty per cent of the drive pro
ceeds will lie used for the running
expenses of the organization, ac

at the migratory camp in San Jose
and scholarships to the Workers'
School and the Asilomar Confer
ence.
