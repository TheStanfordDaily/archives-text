## A.S.S.U. Schedules Ex-Admiralty Lord To Speak Thursday 
### 
Regarded throughout the British
Empire as one of England's most
brilliant "younger statesmen," Al
fred Duff Cooper, former First Lord
of the British Admiralty, will give
Stanford students sidelights on the
present European fray when he

on "How It Happened."
According to Greyson Bryan, man
ager of the A.S.S.U. Lecture Series,

GLARE FOCUSES
Although Dull' Cooper had attained
no mean degree of prominence in
England's political life, the full glare
of the international spotlight did not
focus on him until he resigned from
his Admiralty post in October, 1938,
because he felt that he could not
support Chamberlain's "peace at any
price" settlement of the Chechoslo
vakian crisis with Hitler.
His political history reads like that
of a Gilbert & Sullivan hero: Secre
tarial post in the War Office in 1928,
Minister of War in 1935 and First
Lord of the Admiralty in 1337. In
his spare time he has knocked off
three books, "Talleyrand," "Haig,"
and "House of Lords of Senate."
WON AWARD
Duff' Cooper was educated at Eton
and at Oxford; he served in the
crack Grenadier Guards during the
World War and won the coveted
D.S.O. for his services.
The ex-First Lord is married to
the former Lady Diana Manners,
daughter of the Duke of Rutland.
She is familiar to many American
playgoers through her appearance in
Max Reinhardt's "The Miracle."
