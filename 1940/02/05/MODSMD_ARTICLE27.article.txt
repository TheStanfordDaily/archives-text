# Hungarian Student Recalls Thrills of First Gliding Days
## 
### 
Miklos John Hoff, Stanford gradu- J
ate student in Mechanical Engineer
ing, adjusted his black - rimmed
glasses and modestly admitted that |
he was the first Hungarian ever to
receive a German class A gliding [
license.
"Airplanes and airplane structures j
have been my main interests since j
I graduated from the Zurich Insti
tute of Technology in Switzerland," j
he said in almost perfect English, i
"After graduation I went to Ger- ,
many and took up gliding. There |
were only about 200 class A gliding j
licenses then, in 1929, and I was the 1
first Hungarian to get one."
BECAME LEADER
His German training led Mr. Hoff
back to his native Hungary where j
he became an instructing leader in |
the gliding movement that was j
sweeping the country about that |
time.
"But my gliding days are over,
because 1 crashed and broke my j
neck," he said sadly. "While waiting
for a takeoff, a gust of wind flipped
my plane over backward and sent it !
crashing upside down down the hill.
I busted two vertebrae."
A whistle on his teakettle began
to hiss, so Mr. Hoff hurried off to j
the kitchen. He appeared soon with
the kettle and a box of cookies.
DRINKS TEA
"Of course, I had some tea back !
in my native town of Magyarovar>
near the old Austrian border, but
not as much as I've had here. My j
roommate is English and I have'
acquired his customs," he laughed. :
Mr. Hoff came to Stanford from a
Hungarian airplane factory in order
to carry on Strength-of-material and
stability tests under Professor Ste
phen Timoshenko. He is also doing
some theorizing with Professor Ja- |
cobsen in the vibrations laboratory.
His goal is a doctor's degree.
He most emphatically stated that
he was not representing Hungary's

aeronautical department, nor was he j
studying at Stanford seeking infor- I
mation which will better his coun- |
try's airplanes. Stanford has merely
offered him the opportunity and the
time to carry theoretical research in
the aeronautical structural field for
himself. His nine years in an air
plane factory have given him enough
of a practical basis.
"I never will return to Hungary if
war is declared," he said. "But there
is no reason why war should be de
clared. Germany can have and al
ways has had our products, so war
is not necessary."
PAMPHLETS NUMEROUS
Mr. Hoff's pamphlets on aeronau
tical structural matters are numer
ous, some having appeared in the
Journal of the Royal Aeronautical
Society. One of his best papers—on
which he spent about 1000 hours—
is "Korszeru Repulogepszerkezetek,"
which to you means "Modern Air
plane Structures" when translated
from Hungarian.
"I keep my Hungarian refreshed
by talking with Professor Szego,
head of the mathematics department,
who is Hungarian too," he said with
a smile. "In addition I speak Ger
man and French—and English too."
HOBBY IS SKIING
Skiing is his hobby; it has been for
21 years since he went swooping
down the Alps. A twisted ankle has
kept him from testing American
snows, but next week-end he plans
a trip to Yosemite.
"Your America is a marvelous
place," he said. "Your people act so
youthful, and they do not have the
heaviness of Europe. It Is a fine
thing not to be weighted with the
traditions of your grandfathers and
great-grandfathers."

Oi-Mekon, East Siberia, is said to
be the coldest place in the world.

"I never will return to Hungary if
war is declared," he said. "But there
is no reason why war should be de
clared. Germany can have and al
ways has had our products, so war
is not necessary."
PAMPHLETS NUMEROUS
Mr. Hoff's pamphlets on aeronau
tical structural matters are numer
ous, some having appeared in the
Journal of the Royal Aeronautical
Society. One of his best papers—on
which he spent about 1000 hours—
is "Korszeru Repulogepszerkezetek,"
which to you means "Modern Air
plane Structures" when translated
from Hungarian.
"I keep my Hungarian refreshed
by talking with Professor Szego,
head of the mathematics department,
who is Hungarian too," he said with
a smile. "In addition I speak Ger
man and French—and English too."
HOBBY IS SKIING
Skiing is his hobby; it has been for
21 years since he went swooping
down the Alps. A twisted ankle has
kept him from testing American
snows, but next week-end he plans
a trip to Yosemite.
"Your America is a marvelous
place," he said. "Your people act so
youthful, and they do not have the
heaviness of Europe. It Is a fine
thing not to be weighted with the
traditions of your grandfathers and
great-grandfathers."

Oi-Mekon, East Siberia, is said to
be the coldest place in the world.
Miklos John Hoff, Stanford gradu- J
ate student in Mechanical Engineer
ing, adjusted his black - rimmed
glasses and modestly admitted that |
he was the first Hungarian ever to
receive a German class A gliding [
license.
"Airplanes and airplane structures j
have been my main interests since j
I graduated from the Zurich Insti
tute of Technology in Switzerland," j
he said in almost perfect English, i
"After graduation I went to Ger- ,
many and took up gliding. There |
were only about 200 class A gliding j
licenses then, in 1929, and I was the 1
first Hungarian to get one."
BECAME LEADER
His German training led Mr. Hoff
back to his native Hungary where j
he became an instructing leader in |
the gliding movement that was j
sweeping the country about that |
time.
"But my gliding days are over,
because 1 crashed and broke my j
neck," he said sadly. "While waiting
for a takeoff, a gust of wind flipped
my plane over backward and sent it !
crashing upside down down the hill.
I busted two vertebrae."
A whistle on his teakettle began
to hiss, so Mr. Hoff hurried off to j
the kitchen. He appeared soon with
the kettle and a box of cookies.
DRINKS TEA
"Of course, I had some tea back !
in my native town of Magyarovar>
near the old Austrian border, but
not as much as I've had here. My j
roommate is English and I have'
acquired his customs," he laughed. :
Mr. Hoff came to Stanford from a
Hungarian airplane factory in order
to carry on Strength-of-material and
stability tests under Professor Ste
phen Timoshenko. He is also doing
some theorizing with Professor Ja- |
cobsen in the vibrations laboratory.
His goal is a doctor's degree.
He most emphatically stated that
he was not representing Hungary's

aeronautical department, nor was he j
studying at Stanford seeking infor- I
mation which will better his coun- |
try's airplanes. Stanford has merely
offered him the opportunity and the
time to carry theoretical research in
the aeronautical structural field for
himself. His nine years in an air
plane factory have given him enough
of a practical basis.
"I never will return to Hungary if
war is declared," he said. "But there
is no reason why war should be de
clared. Germany can have and al
