# Rome Press Makes Bid For Balkans
## Italy Claims Stalin Has 'Double Crossed' Hitler; Warns Allies 
### 
ROME, Feb. 4 (UP).—The Italian
Press asserted today that Josef V.
Stalin had "double-crossed" Chan
cellor Adolf Hitler and at the same
time warned Great Britain and
France that Italy is riot neutral but
merely non-belligerent in the Eu
ropean conflict at present.
The statements were made in con
nection with the Allied-German
struggle for advantages in the Bal
kans by the newspapers of Max*shal
Italo Balbo and Virgino Gayda.
In a biter 5,000-word editorial
headed ''Bolshevik Aims," the editor
of Balbo's Corriere Padano of Fer
rara said that Russia "already has
completely abandoned the Reich."
WARNS GERMANY
The editorial carried a strong
warning to Germany and other Eu
ropean powers that Stalin still
clings to the dream of world revo
lution and hopes to reach the Medi
terranean by a drive through the
Balkans.
"But in this," the Corriere Pa
dano's editor, Nicolo Quirici, said,
"Stalin has been halted by the
strong resistance of the Balkans—
Turkey and above all Italy.
ITALY IS SURE
"We are sure that if Germany had
not been engaged at the present mo
ment in a total and urgent problem
on another front Stalin would have
found his way barred also by Ger
man interests.
"There is no doubt that Stalin's
action in the Balkans and especially
his aggression of Finland were far
beyond any px-evious accord with
Hitler.
"The Soviets already are unscru
pulously trampling all German in
terests.
Gayda, writing in the Voce d'ltalia
in an undoubtedly inspired vein,
warned the Allies against being mis
led by Italy's concentration on na
tional problems.
EUROPE UPSET
"This does not mean that Italy is
absent in the great drama which is
upsetting a large part of Europe,"
he said.
"Though non-belligerent—but not
neutral — Italy is always present in
European affairs."
Italy, Gayda said, like Germany,
has grievances and demands in con
nection with the settlements after
the World War.
