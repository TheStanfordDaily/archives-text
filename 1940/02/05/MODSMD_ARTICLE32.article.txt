# Card-Bear Hoop Chances Evened by Series Upsets As Uclans Overcome Cal
## Indians Helpless Against Bronc, Gael Onslaughts in Week-end Series at S.F. But Promise Close Contest Friday 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Even though our Indians looked a little helpless in losing to St. Mary's
because they couldn't hit their hats, and even though they looked a little
outclassed by Santa Clara because the Broncs got hot in one short spurt,
all is not lost for next week's tussle with Cal Friday.
If what Brother Bruin of U.C.L.A. did to Brother Bear of California at

Berkeley Saturday night is any
dieation, then a record of four
straight defeats for the Stanfords
shouldn't deter anyone from think
ing that our chances against Cal
aren't just as good as they ever
were.
UCLANS RISE
Wandering out of the wilderness
of 30 straight defeats at the hands
of Stanford, Cal and U.S.C., the
Uclans got up off the floor where
Cal had left them Friday night to
smite the once-mighty Bear, 34-32;
thus ending a better than two-year
stretch of successive defeats.
EVERYONE WORRYING
Thanks to the Bruins, Stanford
eagers are still fairly well entrenched
in second place in the Southern Di
vision standings, and it's going to
take a lot of work to get them out.
In preparation for the second
game of the series, Coach Everett
Dean is going to give the Cards
some more rest. Monday and
Thursday afternoon workouts have
been called off.
CARDS UNCOLLECTED
Stanford's defeat by Santa Clara,
42-40, Friday night was of the heart
breaker variety. Going into the final
.seven minutes of play, the Indians
held what they thought was a com
fortable seven-point lead, 37-30. In
one of those spurts which are hard
to stop, the Mission outfit rolled up
four field goals before the Cards
could collect themselves.
Then after posting their final
points, the Santa Clarans put on a
dizzy demonstration of keep-away.
They had plenty of chances to make
shots in the last two minutes, but
preferred to stall and hang onto the
ball.
GAELS WERE TOPS
St. Mary's held the upper-hand
throughout the second game and
won going away, 33-30. However, it
was the Indians' coldness which
gave them the victory. Their plays
were working against the Gael zone
defense, which played right into the
Card offense, but no one outside of
Don Williams could connect. St.
Mary's was tops against the Cards,
while the Indians couldn't even
make points from their favorite
spots.

Even though our Indians looked a little helpless in losing to St. Mary's
because they couldn't hit their hats, and even though they looked a little
outclassed by Santa Clara because the Broncs got hot in one short spurt,
all is not lost for next week's tussle with Cal Friday.
If what Brother Bruin of U.C.L.A. did to Brother Bear of California at

Berkeley Saturday night is any
dieation, then a record of four
straight defeats for the Stanfords
shouldn't deter anyone from think
ing that our chances against Cal
aren't just as good as they ever
were.
UCLANS RISE
Wandering out of the wilderness
of 30 straight defeats at the hands
of Stanford, Cal and U.S.C., the
Uclans got up off the floor where
Cal had left them Friday night to
smite the once-mighty Bear, 34-32;
thus ending a better than two-year
stretch of successive defeats.
EVERYONE WORRYING
Thanks to the Bruins, Stanford
eagers are still fairly well entrenched
in second place in the Southern Di
vision standings, and it's going to
take a lot of work to get them out.
In preparation for the second
game of the series, Coach Everett
Dean is going to give the Cards
some more rest. Monday and
Thursday afternoon workouts have
been called off.
CARDS UNCOLLECTED
Stanford's defeat by Santa Clara,
42-40, Friday night was of the heart
breaker variety. Going into the final
.seven minutes of play, the Indians
held what they thought was a com
fortable seven-point lead, 37-30. In
one of those spurts which are hard
to stop, the Mission outfit rolled up
four field goals before the Cards
could collect themselves.
Then after posting their final
points, the Santa Clarans put on a
dizzy demonstration of keep-away.
They had plenty of chances to make
shots in the last two minutes, but
preferred to stall and hang onto the
ball.
GAELS WERE TOPS
St. Mary's held the upper-hand
throughout the second game and
won going away, 33-30. However, it
was the Indians' coldness which
gave them the victory. Their plays
were working against the Gael zone
defense, which played right into the
Card offense, but no one outside of
Don Williams could connect. St.
Mary's was tops against the Cards,
while the Indians couldn't even
make points from their favorite
spots.
