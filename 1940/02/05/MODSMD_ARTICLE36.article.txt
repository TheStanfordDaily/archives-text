# Wily Yearling Team Wallops Piedmont 54-16
## Win Over Trans-bay Squad Gives Frosh Edge for Cal Game 
### 
Stanford's once-beaten frosh bas
ketball team annihilated an ineffec
tual five from Piedmont High
School 54 to 16 Friday night in En
cina Pavilion. Spreading their scor
ing fairly evenly over four men, the
trosh stepped immediately into the
lead and were never threatened.
The tilt makes possible an op
timistic prediction of next Friday
night's battle against the Cal frosh
at Berkeley. The Bear Cubs also
trounced the Piedmont boys but
only by 45-29.
The Piedmont cagers obviously
suffered from stage-fright and were
a hopelessly inadequate crew, espe
cially during the first half, the end
of which saw the Farm yearlings
ahead only 29-2. The visitors failed
to garner a field goal during the first
two quarters.
GAME CONTROLLED)
Jack Dana and Lee McCaffrey re
peatedly stole the ball from their
opponents and even when the Pied
nionters snapped out of it in the

control.
Ed Stamm handled most of the
duties at center while Ed Voss still
lavored his bum ankle. Stamm sank
eight counters, little Freddie Linari,
9, and Dana and big McCaffrey
rammed through 13 and 11 points,
respectively, to lead the tallying.

ond-sUingers into action at the

rammed through 13 and 11 points,
respectively, to lead the tallying.
SUBS MASSACRE
Coach Becb Lee rushed his sec
ond-sUingers into action at the
three-quarter point and, paced by
husky guard Johny Eikuman, the
subs kept up the massacre.
Despite the wcefi.i opposition,
some of. the freshmen turned in
promising performances. The ball
handling of Linari and McCaffrey
and Walt FunabikiV defensive wo:'k
deserve mention.
The lo*; score:
Dana (13) F Whitson
Linari (9) F Hiskey (3)
Stamm (8) C Aver (16)
Funabiki G Higgins (1)
McCaffrey (11) G Witter (2)
Stan. Fr. (54) Pos. Piedmont (l(i)
Subs: Stanford—Meyer (3), Plate
(2), Voss (2), Norberg, Eikelman
(4), Agnew (2); Piedmont —Hawley,
Miller, Siegrist, Kurjian, Smith,
Cuttle, Harbert (4).
Stanford's once-beaten frosh bas
ketball team annihilated an ineffec
tual five from Piedmont High
School 54 to 16 Friday night in En
cina Pavilion. Spreading their scor
ing fairly evenly over four men, the
trosh stepped immediately into the
lead and were never threatened.
The tilt makes possible an op
timistic prediction of next Friday
night's battle against the Cal frosh
at Berkeley. The Bear Cubs also
trounced the Piedmont boys but
only by 45-29.
The Piedmont cagers obviously
suffered from stage-fright and were
a hopelessly inadequate crew, espe
cially during the first half, the end
of which saw the Farm yearlings
ahead only 29-2. The visitors failed
to garner a field goal during the first
two quarters.
GAME CONTROLLED)
Jack Dana and Lee McCaffrey re
peatedly stole the ball from their
opponents and even when the Pied
nionters snapped out of it in the
second half and caged 14 points, the
frosh kept the game well under
control.
Ed Stamm handled most of the
duties at center while Ed Voss still
lavored his bum ankle. Stamm sank
eight counters, little Freddie Linari,
9, and Dana and big McCaffrey
rammed through 13 and 11 points,
respectively, to lead the tallying.
