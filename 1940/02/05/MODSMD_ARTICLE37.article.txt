## 
### 
Dud DeGroot, '24, and Bill Hub
bard, '30, two men who very nearly
became head coaches at the Farm,
yesterday announced that they were
resigning as head football and bas
ketball mentors, respectively, at San
Jose State to accept three-year con
tracts at the University of Roches
ter in New York.
DeGroot, who coached the Spartan
gridders through .13 games without a
defeat last season, was mentioned
prominently in connection with the
head coaching job at Stanford which
finally went to Clark Shaughnessy.
Hubbard, assistant grid coach to
DeGroot and head basketball men
tor at San Jose, was carefully con
sidered for Stanford's head basket
ball coaching position when John
Bunn resigned to become Dean of
Men. Everett Dean was finally se
lected to replace Bunn.
The Maharajah of Bwailor, India,
is reported to be the second richest
man in the world. His jewel chest
has been appraised at $20,000,000.
