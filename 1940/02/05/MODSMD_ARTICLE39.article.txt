### JERRY MAYER 
I LOOSE ENDS PICKED
j UP HERE AND THERE
I On January 15, the Monday fol
| lowing Stanford's double victory
over U.C.L.A.'s basketball team,
J Sideline Slants contained the fol
lowing paragraph:
"The Bruins convinced me that
! this year they are going U> break
I their atrociously long conference
| losing streak which has now reach
ed 28 straight. . . . perhaps against
California, whom they would
rather beat than anyone else."
The Uclans then proceeded to run
their streak to 30, but yesterday
morning's headlines announced:
| U.C.L.A. ENDS LOSING STREAK
* *
It seems that the new regulation
passed by the basketball rules com
mittee allowing the team fouled in
the last five minutes of play the op
tion of taking the foul or putting the
ball into play from out-of-bounds
at midcourt has changed basketball
from a 40-minute game into a 35-
minute contest.
Because, under the new rules,
once the leading team gets posses
sion of the hall within the last five
minutes it can stall its way to vic
tory. If the losing team fouls, then J
the leading team retains posses
sion by merely putting the ball in
play at midcourt instead of taking ;
a chance of losing the ball by tak
ing a foul shot.
Therefore, once that final five
minute rule is put into effect it di
minishes the losing team's chances
of victory a thousand-fold. Take
last Friday night's Santa Clara- |
Stanford game, for instance.
The Broncos took the lead in the
i last five minutes, and immediately
started controlling the ball in the
backcourt. The game was over as
soon as the Santa Clarans com
menced these antics because there
was no possible way Stanford could
get hold of the ball except by an
interception. But when any good
team, like Santa Clara, starts stall
ing, an interception is almost im
possible.
If Stanford fouled the Broncs,
the latter merely took the ball out
of bounds at midficld and retained
, control. Thus the last five min
utes of the game produced no scor
-1 ing and Stanford's hopes were
blasted.
Of course, the old rules, too, were
! inadequate. Before the new regu
; lation came in, Stanford would un
! doubtedly have deliberately fouled
! the Broncos and forced them to take
j a foul shot which, if sunk, would
1 give the Indians the ball, and which,
: if missed, would give the Stanfords
| an equal chance of rebounding it
and gaining possesion that way.
The drawbacks here are ob
vious, also, making for rough play
ing in the final minutes. Many of
us can remember the time U.S.C.
was practically tackling Hank Lui
setti in the final minutes of one
' of the Laughing Boys' games in

order to make Luisetti take a foul
shot and give the Trojans a chance
to gain control of the ball.
But the fact cannot be denied that
basketball has now become a 35-
minute game.
THIS AND THAT: Dr. Thomas W.
MacQuarrie, president of San Jose
State, who has been publicly ridi
culing the new conference athletic
code, is a Stanford alumnus. Dr.
Donald M. Erb, president of the
University of Oregon, who said his
school would "kick down the drain"
the Atherton code if the other
schools did not fully observe it, was
a member of Stanford's Department
of Economics before ascending to his
present position. Irony: Stanford
President Ray Lyman Wilbur was
one of the chief instigators of the
Atherton probe. . . .
Kumor has it that Clark Sliaugh
nessy will sign Marchmont
Schwartz, former Notre Dame
I'oothall hero, as his hackficld as
sistant. Schwartz recently re
signed as head coach at Crelghton
University in Omaha. . . .
Five former Stanford football
players will play prominent parts
on the professional team that will
face Kenny Washington's All-Stars
in Kezar Stadium next Sunday—Er
nie Nevers, who will coach the pros,
Bill Paulman, Pete Fay, Jimmy
Coffis, and Louis Tsoutsouvas.

Because, under the new rules,
once the leading team gets posses
sion of the hall within the last five
minutes it can stall its way to vic
tory. If the losing team fouls, then J
the leading team retains posses
sion by merely putting the ball in
play at midcourt instead of taking ;
a chance of losing the ball by tak
ing a foul shot.
Therefore, once that final five
minute rule is put into effect it di
minishes the losing team's chances
of victory a thousand-fold. Take
last Friday night's Santa Clara- |
Stanford game, for instance.
The Broncos took the lead in the
i last five minutes, and immediately
started controlling the ball in the
backcourt. The game was over as
soon as the Santa Clarans com
menced these antics because there
was no possible way Stanford could
get hold of the ball except by an
interception. But when any good
team, like Santa Clara, starts stall
ing, an interception is almost im
possible.
If Stanford fouled the Broncs,
the latter merely took the ball out
of bounds at midficld and retained
, control. Thus the last five min
utes of the game produced no scor
-1 ing and Stanford's hopes were
blasted.
Of course, the old rules, too, were
! inadequate. Before the new regu
; lation came in, Stanford would un
! doubtedly have deliberately fouled
! the Broncos and forced them to take
j a foul shot which, if sunk, would
1 give the Indians the ball, and which,
: if missed, would give the Stanfords
| an equal chance of rebounding it
and gaining possesion that way.
The drawbacks here are ob
vious, also, making for rough play
ing in the final minutes. Many of
us can remember the time U.S.C.
was practically tackling Hank Lui
setti in the final minutes of one
' of the Laughing Boys' games in

order to make Luisetti take a foul
shot and give the Trojans a chance
to gain control of the ball.
But the fact cannot be denied that
basketball has now become a 35-
minute game.
THIS AND THAT: Dr. Thomas W.
MacQuarrie, president of San Jose
State, who has been publicly ridi

I On January 15, the Monday fol

over U.C.L.A.'s basketball team,
J Sideline Slants contained the fol
lowing paragraph:
"The Bruins convinced me that
! this year they are going U> break
I their atrociously long conference

California, whom they would
rather beat than anyone else."

It seems that the new regulation
passed by the basketball rules com
mittee allowing the team fouled in
the last five minutes of play the op
tion of taking the foul or putting the
ball into play from out-of-bounds
at midcourt has changed basketball
from a 40-minute game into a 35-
minute contest.
Because, under the new rules,
once the leading team gets posses
sion of the hall within the last five
minutes it can stall its way to vic
tory. If the losing team fouls, then J
the leading team retains posses
sion by merely putting the ball in
play at midcourt instead of taking ;
a chance of losing the ball by tak
ing a foul shot.
Therefore, once that final five
minute rule is put into effect it di
minishes the losing team's chances
of victory a thousand-fold. Take
last Friday night's Santa Clara- |
Stanford game, for instance.
The Broncos took the lead in the
i last five minutes, and immediately
started controlling the ball in the
backcourt. The game was over as
soon as the Santa Clarans com
menced these antics because there
was no possible way Stanford could
get hold of the ball except by an
interception. But when any good
team, like Santa Clara, starts stall
ing, an interception is almost im
possible.
If Stanford fouled the Broncs,
the latter merely took the ball out
of bounds at midficld and retained
, control. Thus the last five min
utes of the game produced no scor
-1 ing and Stanford's hopes were
blasted.
Of course, the old rules, too, were
! inadequate. Before the new regu
; lation came in, Stanford would un
! doubtedly have deliberately fouled
! the Broncos and forced them to take
j a foul shot which, if sunk, would
1 give the Indians the ball, and which,
: if missed, would give the Stanfords
| an equal chance of rebounding it
