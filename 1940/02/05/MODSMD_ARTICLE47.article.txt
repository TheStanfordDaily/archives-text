FOR practically the first time since the lurid
red curtains of Memorial Hall first parted,
almost every seat in the theater was filled this
week-end. Playing to houses numbering ap
proximately 200 per cent over any of its arty
predecessors, "The Warrior's Husband" not only
packed 'em in but had 'em rolling in the aisles.
The success of this boisterous comedy proves
one thing: Give a Stanford audience what it asks
for, and it will eat it up. However, the establish
ment of this fact only leads to a question: If the
audience gets what it wants, will it come back
for more?
Obviously a university division attempting
to teach students how to act cannot produce
nothing but uproarious comedies of sex. But it
can make its selections —in every field from
Shakespearean tragedy to George S. Kaufman —
with an eye to audience appeal.
Every play cannot attract 700 or 800 specta
tors, but the Division of Speech and Drama will
find that with two or three productions of the
"Warrior's Husband" type each year it can
greatly increase the average size audience for
all of its presentations.
It seems as if a musical comedy should be
next in line, something like "Of Thee I Sing"
or "Anything Goes." After the success of "The
Warrior's Husband" shows like these could
hang out the "Standing Room Only" sign every
night for a week.
