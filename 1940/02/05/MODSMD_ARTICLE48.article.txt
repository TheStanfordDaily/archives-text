# An Elephant Never Forgets

IN line with an old Republican tradition, Na
tional Committee Chairman John D. M. Ham
ilton stuck his neck out yesterday when he
attacked in one breath the government of Soviet
Russia and the American Youth Congress.
Claiming that the youth organization has
failed to purge Dies-branded Communist ele
ments in its ranks, the factotum of the G.O.P.
refused to send a representative to an AYC
sponsored meeting on civil liberties and citi
zenship.
Actually the Youth Congress is an extremely
idealistic yet relatively harmless group which
devotes itself to such projects as trying to secure
an embargo on exports to Japan. Its member
ship is mainly composed of elements no more
subversive than the Y.M.C.A., the Y.W.C.A., and
young people's church organizations. Even
Stanford is indirectly connected with the body,
since the National Scholastic Federation, of
which the A.S.S.U. is a member, sends a dele
gate to all AYC meetings.
Undoubtedly there actually are representa
tives of left-wing groups in the American Youth
Congress, perhaps even members of the Young
Communists League, as Mr. Hamilton claims.
But when he couples in the same paragraph an
attack on the AYC and a blast at Soviet Russia,
the Chairman of the Republican Party puts him
self in the same ridiculous category as Repre
sentative Dies.
Perhaps the sole purpose of Mr. Hamilton's
denunciation was to criticize Mrs. Franklin D.
Roosevelt who recently defended members of
the Youth Congress from the onslaughts of the
Dies Committee and referred to them in her
column as "my young friends."
After all, taking cracks at Eleanor Roosevelt
is just about the only pleasure left to the Re
publicans these days.
