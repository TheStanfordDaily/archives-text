ONLY two out of 4000 students get the
chance to represent Stanford on this year's
nation-wide debate tour, and in many ways they
are the two most fortunate sudents at Stanford.
One of them is Sherman Mellinkoff. The
other has not yet been named by Debate Coun
cil. But when he is named and the two of them
leave on the last day of finals for a 28-day tour
over the country, they will be in a position to
get a bird's-eye view of a kind of education
seldom got in or out of college.
During those 28 days, they will visit and de
bate at approximately 20 colleges and universi
ties. They will argue four important unsolved
current guestions; they will see what students
in the Southwest, in the Deep South, in the East,
in the Middle West, in the Rocky Mountains
are thinking about these things. And they will
learn from first-hand observations what people
all over the country are interested in; the think
ing people. They will see how university peo
ple are doing things in all parts of this country.
And Stanford is fotunate in having them go.
Not in any ulterior, publicity sense necessarily,

but merely in being able to send two of its
students around the country to get a slice of
perspective, perhaps, and practical training
which should insure their graduating with an
education worthy of Stanford and worthy of
themselves.
This is liberal education. â€”D. J.
