### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
TUITION PLUS A FORI) V-8
I AM trying hard to believe that the writer of Fri
day's Campus Opinion condemning the Stanford
"taxi service" was a very poor satirist. "No student
should come to Stanford," he warned, "who cannot
provide himself with adequate means of transporta
tion." If that statement was meant to be funny or
ironical, its author certainly has a warped conception
of his own abilities. If he thought he was being hu
morous or sarcastic, he would have to conduct quite a
search to find one reader who shared his opinion.
On the other hand, if our anti-pick-up-picket in
tended to be taken seriously, he might be termed a
spokesman for snobbery. Hence, we are faced with
the unpleasant choice of assuming (1) that Campus
Opinioner is linguistically bankrupt, or (2) that he
is decidedly snooty—to indulge in a delicate under
statement. Obviously our no-rides advocate is nour
ishing the belief that he can write; after all, he did
write. So we shall be generous with him and assume
that he is just plainly snobbish.

OUT we certainly must give him credit for unpopu
lar ingenuity. To ferret out such a wealth of ab
surdities requires a man of no mean ability. Take his
idea that Paly-bound riders ruin the upholstery of
the driver's car, for instance. Can't you just see one
of those vandals masquerading as a hitch-hiker? He
tears off the car-door as he vaults in, stuffs cigar butts
in the driver's pockets, and, taking out a cigarette
lighter, starts to burn the seat with a pyromaniacal
gleam in his eye. Obviously, the driver's only re
course is to break the speed limit in an effort to
shorten the ride.
The increased speed, of course, involves the likeli
hood of a crack-up. And then the poor, persecuted
car-owner is immediately sued by his malicious pas
senger. No one has ever heard of such a thing around
Stanford, but this probably shows that the Commun
istic Order of Hitch-hikers has muzzled the courts
and the newspapers. Tragic, isn't it?
But the anti-rides revolt reaches the he.ights of
absurdity (and the low-ebb of thought) when it sug
gests that people who can't provide their own trans
portation had better not come to college at all. I've
always wondered about the purpose of that annoying
page in registration books asking, "If you do not have
a car, just get the hell off this campus!" Owning a car,
after all, really brands one as an exceptionally gifted
scholar—and a "keen guy," if he is careful not to let
another soul ride with him.
This spring quarter we can all make checks pay
able to Stanford University as follows: One hundred
and fifteen dollars plus a Ford V-8. I hope this mad
capitalistic whirl slows down a bit. Soon Campus
Opinioners will be asking for a new sign over the Ad
ministration Building: "Only students admitted who
are children or intimates of sixty families."
