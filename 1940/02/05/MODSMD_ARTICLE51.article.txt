# CAMPUS OPINION
## THE 						SECOND COMING 
### 
'T'HE EDITOR, SIR:
To you know who:
At last, a leader for our cause!
Thou strong and self-radiant rugged individualist,
thou holder of a warrant from the Almighty, wilt thou
deign to pause a moment and listen to this humble one?
Dawgawnit, man, you've got to be careful. There
arc those of us who daily give thanks that we are
suffered to tread the same campus walks as you, but
there are some—a radical fringe—who would encroach
upon your rights. They would attempt to inflame the
rabble with such specious and spurious argument as,
"Who would not ride were his papa possessed of so
firm a hand on the pen and so full a checkbook as
thine?"
But though the demagogues may rant and howl,
and though soon may come the revolution down Paly
way, od not despair. As one who is carrying on the
good fight, you have begun, and who will be at your
side at the barricades, I send thee greeting.
You arc not alone.
"One living in Paly II"
