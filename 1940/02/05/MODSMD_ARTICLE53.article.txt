# "THE UNFORTUNATES" RETORT
## 
### 
'T'HE EDITOR, SIR:
I was truly amazed at the letter in Campus Opin
ion written by " '40 living in Paly." How anyone could
be so un-Stanford in spirit is beyond me. His var
ious oiJtlindd arguments against our hitch-hiking
tradition made me mad enough, but his last paragraph
got me! Especially his last sentence—"He forces him
self upon others and creates a literal burden to those
who are self-reliant and have been thoughtful enough
to provide their own transportation."
Dear " '40 living in Paly," I truly consider myself
self-reliant. I earn my tuition 'during the summer
working in a packing house. I earn my board washing
dishes in Paly. But I'll be damned if self-reliance will
buy a car for me—and being "thoughtful" doesn't
seem to help much either.
This brings me to his logical conclusion: "No stu
dent should come to Stanford who cannot provide him
self with adequate means of transportation." In other
words, Stanford should be a school for only the rich.
The "unfortunates" shall go to Cal or be damned. If
that is the opinion of the majority here, a good many of
us "unfortunates" had better move out.
Naturally your letter was blessed without your
signature. Perhaps you were ashamed to sign it. But
not I!
Sincerey yours,
Herbert Casey, '42
