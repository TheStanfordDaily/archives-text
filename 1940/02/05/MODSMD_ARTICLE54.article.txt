# EXCHANGE DINNER ETIQUETTE
## 
### 
HTHE EDITOR, SIR:
We'd heard of Encina Commons but wo didn't
realize it was that common! It's bad enough to have
to endure the torture of wading through acres of
curious faces, looking for someone with your number,
without being practically inundated in the process.
We sheltered Robleites just aren't used to being
greeted with water-bagsâ€”of course it is delightfully
informal, but it has the queerest effects on one's hair
do and suede shoes, to say nothing of tempers. I defy
anyone to scintillate at dinner after dodging liquid
bombs!
