# Stewart, Sullavan Love By Mail in Lubitsch Film
## 
### 
"THE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER," now playing at the Stanford
Theater.
"Then I looked into niail-box number 237 and there you were."
That's rather cramped quarters for a fellow as elongated as Jimmy
Stewart, hut this current Ernst Lubitsch production—co-starring Marga-

ret Sullavan—is all about a
by mail; hence Miss Sullavan must
have felt some pangs of deep emo
tion every time she found a bundle
of words in 237.
Anyhow "The Shop Around the
Corner" is another one of those typ
ical Stewartian epistles in which he
continues to bend over to talk to
short girls, a mite of a shop man
ager (Frank Morgan), and a little
messenger boy. But this author
lines up his forces against such
other reviewers as Time and John
Mosher to say that "The Shop" is
extremely relaxing entertainment. If
Stewart has "mugged" and leaned
his way to fame, give us more of it. I
PLOT TYPICAL
The plot is mainly enacted in a
typical leather gift shop in Buda
pest just around the corner from the
busy part of town and has a pair of
interesting, if undramatic love
stories to solve. While Stewart, one
of the clerks, is carrying on his in
tellectual mail order romance with
Miss Sullavan, Morgan begins to
have troubles with his wife of 22
years. Nobody gets killed or stabbed
and everybody except the heel who
stole Morgan's rejuvenated spouse
gains his ends in the climax. But
we still liked it.
Closest thing to tragedy was a
suicide attempt by the despondent
Morgan, but he just missed his head
and becomes joyful again on Christ
mas Eve when his two-by-four es
tablishment grosses something like
nine thousand six hundred dollars,
and some pennies.
JIM HAS TROUBLE
Stewart has a little trouble in his
marriage plans when he (a) gets
fired, (b) finds out that his unknown
correspondent is the little sales girl
with whom he has quarreled for six
months. He, too, works out his des
tiny on Christmas Eve and fades out
in the final scene by raising his
pants-legs in front of Miss Sullavan
to prove he is not bowlegged. That
disclosure, however, is open to
question.
The supporting cast, including
either Iranoff or Bulanoff of "Ni
notchka" fame, is exceptional.
"Smashing the Money Ring," the
companion picture is a weird cop
and robber yarn; still the son of a
G-man on the campus vouches for
the story's authenticity.—Jenkins
The ancients believed precious
stones to be alive and to possess
souls.

That's rather cramped quarters for a fellow as elongated as Jimmy
Stewart, hut this current Ernst Lubitsch production—co-starring Marga-

ret Sullavan—is all about a

tion every time she found a bundle
of words in 237.
Anyhow "The Shop Around the
Corner" is another one of those typ
ical Stewartian epistles in which he
continues to bend over to talk to
short girls, a mite of a shop man
ager (Frank Morgan), and a little
messenger boy. But this author
lines up his forces against such
other reviewers as Time and John
Mosher to say that "The Shop" is
extremely relaxing entertainment. If
Stewart has "mugged" and leaned
his way to fame, give us more of it. I
PLOT TYPICAL
The plot is mainly enacted in a
typical leather gift shop in Buda
pest just around the corner from the
busy part of town and has a pair of
interesting, if undramatic love
stories to solve. While Stewart, one
of the clerks, is carrying on his in
tellectual mail order romance with
Miss Sullavan, Morgan begins to
have troubles with his wife of 22
years. Nobody gets killed or stabbed
and everybody except the heel who
stole Morgan's rejuvenated spouse
gains his ends in the climax. But
we still liked it.
Closest thing to tragedy was a
suicide attempt by the despondent
Morgan, but he just missed his head
and becomes joyful again on Christ
mas Eve when his two-by-four es
tablishment grosses something like
nine thousand six hundred dollars,
and some pennies.
JIM HAS TROUBLE
Stewart has a little trouble in his
marriage plans when he (a) gets
fired, (b) finds out that his unknown
correspondent is the little sales girl
with whom he has quarreled for six
months. He, too, works out his des
tiny on Christmas Eve and fades out
in the final scene by raising his
pants-legs in front of Miss Sullavan
to prove he is not bowlegged. That
disclosure, however, is open to
question.
The supporting cast, including
either Iranoff or Bulanoff of "Ni
notchka" fame, is exceptional.
"Smashing the Money Ring," the
companion picture is a weird cop
and robber yarn; still the son of a
G-man on the campus vouches for
the story's authenticity.—Jenkins
The ancients believed precious
stones to be alive and to possess
souls.
