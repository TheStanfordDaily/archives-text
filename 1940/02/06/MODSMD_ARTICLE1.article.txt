### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
PRENCH soldiers stood at atten
tion around the grey walls of
the Paris war office yesterday. They
stood watchfully at attention in the
slow Paris rain.
Inside the building, 14th and 15th
century medieval armor - priceless
and grim—stood against the corridor
walls. The masked faces of the iron
suits stared down superciliously
from their silent formation. They
looked at another array—the gath
ering of the fifth and probably most
significant conferenec of the Allied
supreme war council. The warriors
of medieval France were inspecting
the warriors of modern France.
For here, in day-long session,
sat the Big Men of Europe, pon
dering (he destiny of their west
ern army. Headed bj * rime Min
ister Neville Chamberlain and
Premier Edouard Daladier, the
council discussed the prospects of
an unleashing of the "real war"
this spring and spent a great part
of their time in co-ordinating
plans to supply the British and
French armed forces and home
fronts. In the words of Daladier,
the consultations "were really
formidable."

yi/HILK the Allied premiers and
their key cabinet ministers
discussed economic and diplomatic
moves designed 'o check-mate Ger
mn;iy, the army. navy, and air force
general staffs engaged in technical
conversations. The representation
and detail of the war council dis
cussions indicated that the Allies are
looking forward to possible big
scale action on the fighting fronts
as soon as weather permits.
The British leaders came to i
France in complete secrecy, pre
sumably by airplane, for the fifth
session of the war council but,
unlike the other meetings, an
nouncement was made before the
British conferees had returned
safely to London.
The British delegation, in addi
tion to Chamberlain, included such
leaders as Secretary of Foreign Af
fairs Viscount Halifax, First Lord of
the Admiralty Winston Churchill,
War Minister Oliver Stanley, Air
Minister Sir Kingsley Wood, Ad
miral Sir Dudley Pound, Air Mar
shall Peirse, British Ambassador Sir
Ronald Campbell, General Sir Ed
mund Ironside, who is chief of the
British imperial general staff. It was
y long list of notables.

AS representatives from France
were Daladier, General Gamelin,
Navy Minister Campinchi, Air Min
ister LaChambre, General Vuillemin
of the air force. Admiral Darlan,
Alexis Leger of the foreign office,
General Decamp, and Chapetier De
Ribes, under-secretary of foreign
affairs. If the Germans had bombed
Paris yesterday, they would have
annihilated the whole crop of Allied
diplomats and military strategists
who have been giving them the most
trouble.
Unofficial reports that filtered
through the line of sentries out
side the war building seemed to
show thai Allied aid to Finland
will he increased and speeded.
The Allies apparently believe that
the menace of the war's spread to
Scandinavia is greater than any
possible danger to Holland and
Belgium at the present moment.
Daladier, the rumors had it, fa
vored breaking off all diplomatic
rcaltions with Russia. This would
act as a tremendous incentive to
the French government's stern
anti-Communistic policy at home,
hut Chamberlain put thumbs down
011 the idea. The Britishers were
willing to wait and let Moscow
take the initiative along these
lines.
At the same time the British be
lieve that the help which probably
will reach Finland soon can hold off
the Russian air force. Finland's
military air corps has been quad- 1
rupled since the Soviet, invasion be- I
gan two months ago, it's estimated.
This would mean that the supply
from abroad of fighting, reconnais
sance. and bombing planes has been
staggering.

diplomats and military strategists
who have been giving them the most

The Allies apparently believe that
the menace of the war's spread to
Scandinavia is greater than any
possible danger to Holland and

Daladier, the rumors had it, fa

willing to wait and let Moscow
take the initiative along these
lines.
At the same time the British be
lieve that the help which probably
will reach Finland soon can hold off
the Russian air force. Finland's
military air corps has been quad- 1
rupled since the Soviet, invasion be- I

This would mean that the supply
from abroad of fighting, reconnais

walls. The masked faces of the iron
suits stared down superciliously
from their silent formation. They
looked at another array—the gath

significant conferenec of the Allied
supreme war council. The warriors
of medieval France were inspecting
the warriors of modern France.
