# Stanford Funds Bring Migrants Camp Playroom
## 
### BUD AMES 
Little Jimmy Keep looked out
from under his bowl haircut in
sheepdog fashion and wiped his
nose with the back of his hand.
Jimmy, 7, is typical of the 78 little
migratory workers' children who
live—exist—in San Jose's Migratory
Camp.
"We came from Cheyenne, Wyo
ming," he coughed. "I hitch-hiked
out here with my pop, mom, and my
brud, Bill. We don't have a car and
my pop don't have a job. I sure like
playing here in this house."
Y' MAINTAINS CABIN
Jimmy was referring to the "li
brary" cabin which the social di
vision of Stanford's Y.W.C.A. main
tains as a means of bringing some
pleasure into the overly-serious lives
of these children. The cabin — a
present from the camp owner last
year—was cleaned and decorated at
the expense of the VW.C.A.
A portion of the proceeds of Stan
ford's "Y" drive which is now in
progress will be used to maintain
this library for another year—to
buy paste, crayons, benches, a stove
and many much-needed things.
EACH TELLS STORY
As Jimmy spoke, his comrades filed
in from the muddy corners of the
camp. As each child arrived he in
troduced himself to the four "Y"
girls who drive down to the camp
every Tuesday afternoon and Satur
day morning. Each had a story to
tell.
"I'm Billy Keep," a little 5-year
old youngster mumbled. "I like
playing in here a lot better than
picking beans with my pop like I
used to. Besides I never got paid.
Pop got all the money."
COUGHS PREVALENT
He broke into a laugh and the
laugh turned into a hacking cough.
It appears that all the camp children
have coughs and colds due to the
water and mud which is outside
every door.
"I'm Gail," chirped a surprisingly
clean blond boy. "I'm not sure where
we come from. I'm 10, and I have a
sister and two brothers. But they
can't come today because my sister
has to stay home and watch after my
brother who has the whooping
cough."
LOCAL PUPILS UPPITY'
We asked him where all the chil
dren were.
"Well, the church people came and
took most of them away for a wood
work class this morning," Gail con
tinued. "I couldn't go because I
didn't have any shoes at first, until
my mother got me some."
Gail, like the other old-enough
camp children, goes to a San Jose
school. He said he liked it "well
enough" but he did feel that some
of the regular kids were "kinda'
uppity" toward the migratory chil
dren.
Running everywhere were red
heads. They arc members of the
Watson family. Ruby, about 6, spoke
for the group.
"I'm not sure where we came
from, but I think it was some place
in Canada," she mumbled, as she
crayoned a picture torn from a book.
"My father doesn't have a job now,
but he is looking all the time. No,
we don't have very much to eat."
STORIES SIMILAR
The stories of most of them were
about the same. All are young and
yet they are all surprisingly old.
They think like adults but they still
like to play like children. They
pleaded for piggy-back rides and
sat. silently listening to a story. Their
favorite game is "rotten egg" which
entails a lot of jumping and shaking.
Children were running pell-mell
about the 24-by-24-foot cabin. Sud
denly Jimmy shouted.
"Want a nickel?"
"Yes, Jimmy."
"Suck a pickle."
All the children laughed and a
few began to cough.
