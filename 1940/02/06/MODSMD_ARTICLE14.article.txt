# Speeding Cases Show Decline
## Parking Fines Still High, Says Putnam 
### 
A definite decrease in campus
speeding for the past week was an
nounced yesterday by Men's Coun
cil and Campus Officer Gordy Davis.
Chairman Bob Putnam stated that
the new policy of banning student
cars from the campus after three
speeding offenses has materially de
creased speeding cases and im
proved general auto conduct.
Last week's fines collected for
speeding totaled $32, while at yes
terday's meeting only $9 was taken
in fines from campus speeders.
However, the percentage of total
collected from parking violators
more than doubled during the past
week, jumping from $13 to $28.
A new violation for which cam
pus drivers are being cited was re
vealed by Officer Davis. Students
are permitted to park in the field
behind the Education Building
parking lot, he stated, but because
of the soggy condition of the ground
in the field students are parking
with part of their cars protruding
onto the pedestrian sidewalk, forc
ing people to walk cither into the
street or the field.
Violators of this regulation will be
.continuously apprehended by Davis
until the situation is entirely cleared
up.
Another matter on the Men's
| Council docket yesterday was that
I of parking in the Branner loop. This
area was restricted at the request
of students in the dormitory sev
eral years ago, and Branner men are
now getting up a petition to the
I Comptroller's office to have these re
strictions rescinded. However, until
(definite action is taken by the ad
j ministration, Chairman Putnam em
phasized that tickets will be given to
I students parking in the Loop.
