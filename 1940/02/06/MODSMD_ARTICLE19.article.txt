# Wilbur Criticizes Motion Picture Industry's Attack On Theater Booking Law
## President Brands Movie Methods As 'Irresponsible'; Calls Neely Bill Safeguard from War Propaganda 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 5 (UP). â€”Dr. Rav Lyman Wilbur, president
of Stanford University and chairman of the Motion Picture Itesearch
Council, today sharply criticized the motion picture industry for "irre
sponsible" methods in opposing the Neely Kill outlawing block hooking
of films by the nation's theaters. a

Dr. Wilbur told the council the
Neely Bill was essential to help
protect cinema-goers from "propa
ganda" films or undesirable pictures.
"The critical world situation to
day," he said, "is apt to further di
minish the .sense of local responsi
bility for community activities. No
matter what is going on abroad we
have our children to protect, our
homes to care for, and our imme
diate needs to meet.
LITTLE ESCAPE
"Now there is but little escape
possible from all sorts of war propa
ganda. For the most part we have
to take films as they are given to
us, with but little choice on the
part of parents. The choices come
from the movie heads and are a
mixture of good, indifferent or
worse. . . ."
Wilbur said the "tremendous in
fluence" of motion pictures should
be kept sensitive to the will of local
communities.
"Centralized control of an educa
tional medium as important as the
so-called entertainment film would
permit blind forcing of undisclosed
propaganda into communities
throughout the land. It is abhorrent
to American traditions and ideals,"
Wilbur said.
SORE SPOTS?
Wilbur said spokesmen for the
movie industx'y were attacking or
ganizations supporting the Neely
Bill as "sore spots of democracy."
"To characterize such organiza
tions as the National Congress of par
ents and teachers, the Association of
American University Women, the
National Council of Catholic Wom
en, and the Protestant Episcopal
Church as sore spots on democracy
is more than irresponsible," Wilbur
said.
"We must question the advisabil
tiy of leaving in the hands of those
who stoop to such attacks the edu
cation of our citizens, young and old,
through the medium of motion pic
tures."
MEANS OUTLINED
Wilbur said the movie industry
was seeking public support by
methods comparable to a situation
in the film "Mr. Smith Goes to
Washington."
"The public relations organization
of the movie business," he said, "is
seeking to create a situation like
that depicted in 'Mr. Smith Goes to
Washington,' where thousands of
well-meaning citizens were led to
send telegrams denouncing a Senator
whose activities were misrepresented
to them.
"The trade papers report a cam
paign is under way for industry
employes to secure letters opposing
the Neely Bill irom the tradesmen
they patronize, without presenting
copies of the bill for study," he said.
