# Soviets Lose 18,000 Men, Say Reports
## Finns Said to Have Dispersed or Killed Entire Red Division 
### 
HELSINKI, Tues., Feb. (i (UP).
Unofficial quarters, commenting
on Scandinavian reports, said
early today Finnish troops might
have dispersed and perhaps com
pletely wiped out a Russian divi
sion of about 18.000 men in the
crushing of a strong Red Army of
fensive northeast of Lake Ladoga.
' Last night's military communique
announced the capture Sunday of a
"strong enemy point" on the shore
of Lake Ladoga, where the Russian
defenders were said to have fled
over the bodies of more than 500 of
their comrades.
The communique also reported
the crushing of six Russian attacks
along the eastern frontier from the
Karelian Isthmus north to Salla but
officials in Helsinki said they were
unable to confirm Stockholm dis
patches describing the wiping out of
the Red Army's 18th Division with
nearly 18,000 dead.
NO QUICK VICTORY
If the Russian division finally has
been wiped out —as the Red Army's
44th the 103 rd Divisions were trap
ped and annihilated at Suomussalmi
—it was believed the process prob
ably was spread over two weeks of
fighting.
The Russians appeared to have
spent their strength in days of ham
mering at the Mannerheim Line on
the Karelian Isthmus and at Aitto
joki to (he north of Lake Ladoga
because Sunday's enemy assaults
were far weaker and easily repulsed,
tonight's communique said.
But the Russian Air Force showed
no relaxation of its mass bombing
attacks on towns and villages from
the Arctic Ocean to the Gulf of Fin
land and continued to heap explo
sives ranging up to 550-pound
bombs on civilian centers with a
steadily mounting toll of dead, it
was stated.
AIR FORCE WEAK
Finland's skeleton air force strug
gled to beat off the aerial invasion
and on Sunday brought down at
least 9 and perhaps 13 Russian
planes, the communique said.
An official air raid precautions re
port. today said that, in one week,
from Jan. 28 to Feb. 3, daily mass
attacks by fleets of 50 to 400 Rus
sian planes killed 145 civilians and
injured 179 in 141 raided communi
ties. Six hospitals were among the
targets of the Russian fliers, who
were said to have dropped a total
of 6,800 bombs during the week.
