# Jackie Cps League Cage Score Lead
## Robinson Garners 27 Points for U.C.L.A. In Cal Hoop Games 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
As was predicted by most bas
ketball experts last week. Jackie j
Robinson, who personally led (lie
[{ruins of mil of the j
throes of ."><) straight defeats, i
usurped Ralph Vaughn's place at
the head of the Southern Division |
individual scoring parade.
Robinson didn't quite do il all by j
himself, but his 27 points over the j
week-end wore surely a good share |
of the tonic the Bruins needed to !
grab, finally, a conference victory, j
The Bruin flash now.has 75 points!
on 27 field goals and 21 free throws, j
and he leads Vaughn, the Trojan I
terror, by 11 points.
WILLIAMS NOW FOURTH
Don Williams, as a result of Rob- j
inson's spectacular rise, dropped into !
fourth place in the scoring, a point j
behftid Dale Sears of U.S.C. Sears j
has 55 points and Williams 54.
Stanford, U.S.C., and California j
have three men each in the top 10. j
Below Williams are Ken Davidson !
with 45 points in seventh place, and j
Bill Cowden in 10th place with 35 |
points.
A noticeable feature of this year's |
race is the fact, that all four teams j
have yielded about the same num- j
ber of points. U.S.C* has had 202 |
points scored against them and Stan- I
ford 210. California and U.C.L.A., J
although they have won but a game j
each, have had but 227 and 218
points, respectively, scored against
them.
TROJANS HIGH TEAM
The Trojans are the high-scoring j
team, with 263 points, while Stan
ford is 30 points behind, with 233 in
live games. The Trojan average is
52 points a game; Stanford's 47.
In games this week, California is
host to Stanford, and the Bruins !
meet their deadly Trojan rivals with
the determination to rub out a long :
string of defeats at U.S.C.'s hands
which goes back to 1935.
Coach Everett Dean has ordered
some more rest for his team this
week. The quintet didn't practice
yesterday and probably won't work
out Thursday afternoon.

The Bruin flash now.has 75 points!
on 27 field goals and 21 free throws, j
and he leads Vaughn, the Trojan I
terror, by 11 points.
WILLIAMS NOW FOURTH
Don Williams, as a result of Rob- j
inson's spectacular rise, dropped into !
fourth place in the scoring, a point j
behftid Dale Sears of U.S.C. Sears j
has 55 points and Williams 54.
Stanford, U.S.C., and California j
have three men each in the top 10. j
Below Williams are Ken Davidson !
with 45 points in seventh place, and j
Bill Cowden in 10th place with 35 |
points.
A noticeable feature of this year's |
race is the fact, that all four teams j
have yielded about the same num- j
ber of points. U.S.C* has had 202 |
points scored against them and Stan- I
ford 210. California and U.C.L.A., J
although they have won but a game j
each, have had but 227 and 218
points, respectively, scored against
them.
TROJANS HIGH TEAM
The Trojans are the high-scoring j
team, with 263 points, while Stan
ford is 30 points behind, with 233 in
live games. The Trojan average is
52 points a game; Stanford's 47.
In games this week, California is
host to Stanford, and the Bruins !
meet their deadly Trojan rivals with
the determination to rub out a long :
string of defeats at U.S.C.'s hands
which goes back to 1935.
Coach Everett Dean has ordered
some more rest for his team this
week. The quintet didn't practice
yesterday and probably won't work
out Thursday afternoon.
