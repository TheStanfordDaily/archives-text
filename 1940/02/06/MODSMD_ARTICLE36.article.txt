# Moisture Daunts Stanford Nine
## 
### 
Four score and some centuries ago
the Stanford diamondeers played a
baseball game.
That's what Western Civ students
are going to be learning one of these
days if the weather man continues
to plague Harry Wolter's ball club
by deluging the Sunken Diamond
with liquid sunshine the day before
every scheduled game.
The moisture has contributed to
agriculture by fostering a fine crop
of assorted weeds on the infield, but ;
the ball-players are afraid to ven- j
ture out into the morass unless a I
derrick is handy.
Harry Wolter is seriously consid- j
ering equipping his infielders with I
snowshoes for their game against i
the University of San Francisco
Dons tomorrow. If that won't work,
he might borrow some horses from
the R.O.T.C. and mount his players.
