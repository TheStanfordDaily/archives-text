WHY NOT NON-ATHLETES
FOR It.A C. NOMINATIONS?
Up on the Row and down in the
Halls, Those Who Are Interested in
Politics are gearing political ma
chinery for the annual mid-winter
elections which will be held next
week.
Usually the mid-winter elections
are very tame compared to the
fiery caucuses connected with the
spring balloting, Ii tradition holds
suiay for the coming winter elec
tions. a few of the Hall and Row
bigwigs will get together in their
respective groups and throw to
gether a quick list of candidates,
who then will he voted upon next
week.
The campus will take it just as
lackadaisically as usual, and there
undoubtedly will be a very small
percentage of Stanford students tak
ing the trouble to stop off at the
polls long enough to cast their bal
lot.
Personally, Sideline Slants
shares the general apathy of the
campus toward the coming elec
tion—except at one post, that of
student representative on the
Board of Athletic Control.

For years it has been the custom
for both campus factions to put up
an athlete for the position of B.A.C.
representative, probably on the the
ory that athletes are better quali
fied to know the intricate prob
lems of the Board.
That is good logic in itself, ex
cept for the fa< t that a good per
centage of these athletes are also
pbyAal education majors who ex
pect k< get good recommendations
fsom Stanford's Department of
Physical Education when i< ey an
piv for coaching jobs.
Of course, no one honestly be
lieves that the Department of Phys
ical Education would attempt to co
erce these students' decisions in any
way, but as long as the l possibility
is there the average student is going
to be scratching his head.
Let's take the hypothetical case
of student 15.A.C. representative
Stan Ford, who is sincerely op
posed to a certain measure the

alumni members of the Board are
advocating. But it so happens
that one of the B.A.C. alumni
members is also closely connected
| with the organization that has
been helping Ford, a star mem
ber of the cricket team, through
school. Ford naturally is in a
tough spot.
But it could be even worse. Per
| haps the Department of Physical
| Education is also behind the alumni
members of the B.A.C. in respect to
j this debated measure. Stan Ford
| wants to be a cricket coach when he
! graduates from his alma mater and
a recommendation from the head of
his physical education department
would certainly aid him to land a
good job. That puts him in a double
hot-seat.
I

It seems obvious to us that if the
politicians who are making out the
How and Hall slates want to really
do the student body a favor, they
will nominate for the position of
B.A.C. representative men who have
absolutely no obligations to anyone
concerned with the Board of Ath
letic Control or the Department of
Physical Education. They will nomi
nate fire-snorting undergraduates
who can get up and speak their
piece with no worry about their fu
ture tucked away in the backs of
their minds.
The men they nominate can he
athletes — hut don't need to he.
There is no reason for believing
that a non-athlete couldn't make
every hit as good—if not better—a
B.A.C. member than an athlete.
Furthermore, a non-athlete could
lake a detached, impersonal view
of the proceedings that would be
almost impossible for any athlete
to take.
Slants is firmly convinced that
this is a good, sound suggestion guar
anteed to give the student body a
maximum of voice with its three
votes on the Board.
