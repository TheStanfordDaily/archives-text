## 
### 
With weather conditions had and Lady Luck against them, members
of the Stanford ski team managed to win a solid third place in ihe Reno
Winter Carnival held last week-end under the sponsorship of the Uni
versity Â»>f Nevada.
The slalom event of the meet, which should have been the best show-

ing for Stanford, was won by
Janss, ski team captain, but Stan-1
ford's total score in the event won '
only third place. Bud McDuffie,
who has turned in good times on the
slalom, fpl) on his first run, ;md could |
not make up for it in the second.
Scores in tournaments of this kind
are determined by adding together
the times of the three fastest men
from each team and ranking the j
schools by these totals.
CAL WINS LANGLALT
In the cross-country race, Cal j
turned in a surprising first place,
followed by Nevada and Stanford.
Storen of Stanford showed up un- i
usually well in this event, although J
he is used to longer cross-country !
runs, he said.
The downhill event was won eas- I
ily by Janss, with McDuffie and \
Phil Clayburgh turning in good
times.
The surprise event as far as Stan- j
ford is concerned was the jumping, j
Stanford, with the first jumping team S
in her history, showed well. Janss j
did the best with a jump of 75 feet.
McDuffie, who began jumping only |
two weeks ago, showed excellent j
form and looks very promising, said j
the judges.

Eleanor Watson, last year's carni- |
val queen, took a third for Stanford j
in the women's slalom.
