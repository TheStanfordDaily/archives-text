# D.U., Theta Xi Gain Victories
## Kessel Buckets 29 Points, Breakers Win 
### 
Flashy Jack Kessel set the high
scoring mark for the season by scor
ing an amazing 29 points as the Delta
Upsilon five threshed a bewildered
A.K.L. team, 51-8, last night. Kessel
was unstopable and broke away to
score almost at will.
The black-shirted Theta Xi team
routed a very weak Theta Chi live,
43-12. Hugh O'Donnell led the win
ners by getting away for 14 points.
