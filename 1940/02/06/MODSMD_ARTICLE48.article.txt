TODAY and tomorrow nominations are open
for the annual mid-term elections which take
place one week from today. Among the offices
to be filled is that of B.A.C. representative, a
post which receives very little consideration at
the polls, yet one which becomes a storm-center
every time the Board of Athletic Control makes
a significant decision.
Actually the B.A.C. berth is an extremely
important job. Two student members, one
elected in winter guarter and one in spring,
together with the - president of the A.S.S.U.,
possess one-third of the responsibility for every
action taken by the Board.
When a track coach or a football coach is to
be chosen or when a track stadium is to be built
everyone blesses or blames the undergraduate
representatives. But when these men actually
are elected, the voters give little or no thought
to their gualifications.
On the surface it appears that the only re
guirements are that a candidate possess a thor
ough knowledge of the Stanford athletic set-up
and that he be in close touch with student opin
ion. Naturally he must be completely unpreju
diced in all of his decisionsâ€”and here is where
the present situation fails to measure up.
Almost every elected B.A.C. representative
in recent years has been either a physical edu
cation major or an athlete on a scholarship. As
long as students in either of these categories
are on the Board, an undeniable danger exists
that pressure may successfully be brought to
bear on them.
No one is being accused of any dirty work,
but such things could come to pass.
Physical education majors must depend on
the heads of their department to secure jobs
after they have graduated from school. Schol
arship athletes are at the mercy of the alumni
who are paying their tuition.
The evils of the situation are obvious.
Without any reflection on the high type of
men who have served as B.A.C. representatives
in the past, without any slur on the activities of
the faculty and alumni members, it is clear that
the man with no ties or obligations whatsoever
is the only one who can fairly represent the
student body on the Board.
