# 'Charity Begins at Home'
## 
### 
WHEN students are hit for contributions to
such causes as, say, a "Fund to Aid Ti
betan Veterans," their fingers tighten convul
sively on their billfolds. Instead of helping the
charity, they spend their nickels at the Union.
But the story is different when the purpose
of the drive is close to home, when the results
can be seen, and when the organization has a
past record of conscientious service.
Yesterday, the campus Y.W.C.A. began its
annual fund drive. Their goal, $700; their pur
pose, practical, immediate. Contributions to the
drive will be used in part for running expenses,
the remainder to provide popular periodicals in
the library, to support their recreation center for
children at the San Jose migratory workers'
camp, and to give scholarships to the annual
"Y" conference at Asilomar.
Contributors may earmark their donations,
specifying whether the money is to be used
for running expenses or in the pursuit of a
Y.W.C.A. activity.
A record of past "Y" projects on the Stanford
campus reveals a multitude of practical, helpful
services. It is a record that should aid the drive
considerably.
For instance, besides the migrant children's
library, the "Y" has formerly been responsible
for the pre-reg program, the freshman hand
book, the Roble sponsor system, the Women's
Clubhouse, the Employment Bureau, and the
Sophomore Luncheons. Each of these activities
is now an integral part of Stanford life.
If they reach their S7OO goal, the members
plan to devote $415 to running expenses, and
$285 to service activities. The service program
includes the children's recreation center, S5O;
Asilomar scholarships, $75; the San Francisco
workers' school, $60; and the Stanford Library,
$100.

Wisely setting their charities within the limits
of practicality, and following their plans with
achievement, the campus Y.W.C.A. can be ex
pected to utilize drive funds efficiently and well.

If they reach their S7OO goal, the members
plan to devote $415 to running expenses, and
$285 to service activities. The service program
includes the children's recreation center, S5O;
Asilomar scholarships, $75; the San Francisco
workers' school, $60; and the Stanford Library,
$100.

Wisely setting their charities within the limits
of practicality, and following their plans with
achievement, the campus Y.W.C.A. can be ex
pected to utilize drive funds efficiently and well.

WHEN students are hit for contributions to
such causes as, say, a "Fund to Aid Ti
betan Veterans," their fingers tighten convul
sively on their billfolds. Instead of helping the
charity, they spend their nickels at the Union.
But the story is different when the purpose
of the drive is close to home, when the results
can be seen, and when the organization has a
past record of conscientious service.
Yesterday, the campus Y.W.C.A. began its
annual fund drive. Their goal, $700; their pur
pose, practical, immediate. Contributions to the
drive will be used in part for running expenses,
the remainder to provide popular periodicals in
the library, to support their recreation center for
children at the San Jose migratory workers'
camp, and to give scholarships to the annual
"Y" conference at Asilomar.
Contributors may earmark their donations,
specifying whether the money is to be used
for running expenses or in the pursuit of a
Y.W.C.A. activity.
A record of past "Y" projects on the Stanford
campus reveals a multitude of practical, helpful
services. It is a record that should aid the drive
considerably.
For instance, besides the migrant children's
library, the "Y" has formerly been responsible
for the pre-reg program, the freshman hand
book, the Roble sponsor system, the Women's
Clubhouse, the Employment Bureau, and the
Sophomore Luncheons. Each of these activities
is now an integral part of Stanford life.
