### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
QUITE A CARD
/1Y PERKINS, that famous hay seed (the original
farmer in traveling salesman stories), went to the
"big city" one time. "Heh, heh!" old Cy chortled to
his friends upon his return. "I shore did fool them city
slickers!"
"G'wan, Cy," said Elmer Hick, "us'ns can't put
anythin' over on them city slickers! They're oily crit
ters."
"Yes, I did too," Cy came back. "I told all them
city fellers my name was Jones. And it ain't Jones
at all; it's Perkins."
Yes, sir, old Cy Perkins was quite the card. And
it seems that our Farm has its very own Cy Perkins.
A real, sly article. He wrote a Campus Opinion to
The Daily, that now-famous Campus Opinion criti
cizing the Stanford cusotm of giving free rides to Paly.
And he signed some other chap's name to the letter.
This other chap, known to the Campus as "40 living
in Paly," didn't intend to decry the Stanford "taxi
service" at all. Neither did the practical jokester who
actually wrote the letter. He forged someone else's
name. He thought he was just awfully funny.
Yup, he shore did put it over on the whole campus.
He told us his name was "40 living in Paly," and that
ain't his name at all. How the Jello Company ever
hired Jack Benny with a wit like that running around
is really hard to understand.

/ \UR secret agents (D-l and D-2), of course, ap
prehended the funny man as he was in the act of
writing a gloat-letter to The Daily. His somewhat
tardy epistle is in the mails now, and will probably
arrive this afternoon.
From a pragmatic point of view, the letter didn't
do any harm. It stirred up a lot of valuable support
for the free-rides-to-Paly movement. But it is a little
sad to think that the support had to come from a
half-baked clown who will unquestionably grow up to
be a check-forger. It's just lucky for him that Agents
D-l and D-2 are absolutely loyal to The Daily and
have as yet not affiliated themselves with J. Edgar
Hoover.
Another sad commentary on this whole sordid busi
ness is the type of humor that some Stanford stu
dents are capable of. We thought tht "'4O living in
Paly" had a paranoid conception of his literary abil
ity. We are now forced to abandon our former opin
ion. This poor pigmy-of-whimsy doesn't have an ex
aggerated notion of his literary ability. It is his imag
inary value as a comedian that has dazzled the lad.
I can just see him now as he sat in a morphine
like dream of glory. "Groucho Marx? Fred Allen.'
he mused. "Ha! I've got them all beat. Funny? Why,
I'm just a scream!"
Hereafter our agents are going to work in co-opera
tion with the Psychology Department. We must take
practical steps to disabuse some of our would-be hu
morists of their self-dazzling ideas of brilliance. If not,
we will soon be having some misguided soul imper
sonating President Roosevelt on the front porch of
The Daily shack. "My friends," he will say. And he
will be unable to go on as he roars with laughter.
