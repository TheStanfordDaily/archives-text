r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
With respect to the letter of " '40 Living in Paly,"
we wish to submit our whole-hearted approval of his
damning that obnoxious tradition of bumming rides.
We cei-tainly do agree. No appreciation! When we
give students rides they never offer any thanks. Why,
the last parasite one of the boys picked up wiped his
feet on the upholstery, stole the cigarette lighter, and
then said, "Well, where can I let YOU out?" And this
accident-liability! After one of the boys rolled his
car (it was only the eighth time) on Palm Drive, he
was sued by the relatives of two of his passengers.
And furthermore this stop-and-go-driving is put
ting us in the hole. We figure it costs us ,0012-plus
cents per stop per hitch-hiker, and this sum is begin
ning to cut in on our country-club fees. We find that
"our unfortunates," are not even sorry about the bound
less inconvenience that they cause us self-reliant stu
dents who arc thoughtful enough to provide ourselves
with cars (thanks to the old man).
Yes, that nawsty tradition is certainly a bother.
