r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
In answer to the letter of.Mr. "'4O Living in
Paly," I can only say that a ride with him would be
much more trying on his passenger than on Mr. '40.
It is fortunate indeed that there are a number of car
owners on the campus not so small and petty as our
friend in Paly, who will go a bit out of their way to
give a fellow student a much appreciated ride.
1. I have never failed to see a person receiving a
ride thank his benefactor immediately upon getting
into the car.
2. So far as I can determine, there have been no
accidents involving both drivers and guests. I would
like to know just where our big-hearted friend in Paly
gets his statistics that nine out of ten riders will sue
their drivers in the event of an accident. . . .
I must admit, that the giving of rides does place a
small burden upon the car owner especially when that
person is self-centered and burdened with his own
training in "self-reliance" and "individuality." It
must be indeed gratifying to have such little need for
the good will of one's fellow students.
Sincerely,
B. N. R.
