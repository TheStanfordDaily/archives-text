# LET 'EM EAT CAKE
## 
### 
HTHE EDITOR, SIR:
I've seen some rather dirty blots of the honor
of Stanford, and even a few on that of the Class of '40.
but that letter in Friday's paper is most certainly the
worst! I can well understand why the writer should
want to remain anonymous—wisely so.
Under ordinary circumstances, I am one of those
fortunate enough to have a car, and am always glad
to offer lifts to anyone apparently in want of one.
Contrary to his assertions, these rides are appreciated,
usually with verbal thanks. And where the h does
lie get that stuff about not coming here unless a per
son can afford transportation? Sounds like the "let
'em eat cake" attitude that lost a certain French queen
her head. . . ,
Yours for more Paly rides,
Junius Cary
