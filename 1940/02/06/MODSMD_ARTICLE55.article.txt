# Ballet Russe Closes Run With Vivid Performance
## 
### 
Concluding their San Francisco season with a varied and excellent
program, the Ballet Kussc bowed out of the Opera House last night. The
last performance included "Lake of the Swans," "Three-Cornered Hat,"
"Afternoon of a Faun," and that delight of the infrequent ballet-goer,

"Gaiete Parisienne."
"Lake of the Swans," the lovely
classical ballet about a Swan
Queen, was beautifully danced by
Alexandra Danilova, Andre Eglev
sky, and Roland Guerard.
Remarkable for its Picasso decor
and brilliant Popova costuming was
"Three-Comered Hat." Efrem Kurtz
conducted the De Falla music with
the fervor that it deserves. The mu
sic has all the warmth and color of
old Spain and it spread infectiously
through the audience until even the
most reverent ballet enthusiast was
tapping his toes on the back of the
seat in front of him.
COSTUMING WEAK
The choreographic tableau, "Af
ternoon of a Faun," has of course
practically no action, but Igor
Yousekevitch contributed a beauti
ful physique to the Faun. The cos
tuming of the nymphs, however, was
too conventionalized to make the
eroticism of the Faun seem credible.
"Gaite Parisienne" credits the
French capital with the charm and
gaiety *'Le Beau Danube" gives to
Vienna. One could not escape the
thought, however, that Massine
should have restrained the Peruvian
when writing this ballet. There is
just too much Massine.
GOOI) ENTERTAINMENT
The lovely faces of the feminine
dancers, the composition of the
group disposition on the stage, and
the uniformly excellent scenery
combined to make the entire evening
a very satisfactory experience. The
charm and flavor of another happier
era that the ballet conveys does a
creditable job bf effacing the some
what unpleasant taste left by an
overdose of the realistic theater.â€”
