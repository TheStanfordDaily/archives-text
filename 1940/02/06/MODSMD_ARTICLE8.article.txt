# Youth Congress Challenges House
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 5 (UP).—
American Youth Congress leaders,
meeting at the White House with
members of the United States Con
gress, tonight defended their refusal
to expel allegedly Communist-dom
inated groups from their organiza
tion by asserting they were being
asked to do something the federal 1
Congress would not do itself—out- j
law Communists.
"They told us, in effect, that we
were asking them to do something
we didn't have the intestinal forti
tude to do ourselves," said a House
member, who asked that his name
not be used.
Youth Congress leaders, it was
learned, explained that the Congress
itself is merely a central organiza
tion with no membership of its own
but with G2 affiliated organizations.
