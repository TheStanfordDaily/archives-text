### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
(JN THE SHORES of Lake Ge
neva stands a white marble pal
▼ ace dedicated to peace.
It's good for the tourist trade—
that is, it was good—and it used to
be thronged with diplomats. Some
of Europe's statesmen hope the
United States won't enter the cur
rent world war for one good rea
son. "Look," they say, "at what she
left us after the other war — the
League of Nations." And, lately, the
League has been an object of slight
embarrassment to some of the men
who so light-handedly maneuver
the destiny of Europe. Yes, the
League has fallen into disrepute.
But today at The Hague a
League of Nations committee may
hear still another proposal to end
hostilities—both in northern Eu
rope and along the western front.
The latest proposition, rumor has
it, will come from a neutral
power—like the plans earlier last
autumn from Belgium and Hol
land. But the important item is
that the prohahle peace moves arc
inspired by Germany — and that
the neutral power is simply acting
as a front for Hitler.

r | ,, HEIIE is no sound basis for be
lief in the matter. It's only
hearsay. But the League of Nations,
the broadest agency for peace ever
conceived by a civilization, may
hear the plan officially today. The
rumors were persistent last night,
especially in Scandinavia. After
hearing that the Allies feared the
spread of Russian domination across
the Baltic countries, Scandinavia
was ridden with whispered ques
tions, doubts, fear, and hopes. May
be Hitler really was ready to call it
off. Maybe Hitler was actually go
ing to undertake peace overtures to
end not only the Russo-Finnish con
flict but his own war with France
and Britain as well.
Reports from United Press corre
spondents in Copenhagen repre
sented that Hitler hopes to mediate
the northern war through his en
voys in Moscow and Finland. Dis
patches to the Copenhagen Extra
bladet from Oslo and Stockholm
said reports were curi-ent through
out Scandinavia that a six-point
program, on which Field Marshall
Hermann Goering was said to have
suggested that Germany might agree
to peace, will be laid before the
League committee for discussion.

of course, officially
denied the whole thing. Au
thorized sources in Berlin said the
proposals would be "practically im
possible at this stage of the war." A
Nazi spokesman said that "peace
cannot be won any longer by de
liberations." Hitler, you may re
member, has already declared him
self against any German peace ini
tiative, but at. the same time he will
very likely not issue a flat denial
of the reports at present.
The six-point program, as re
ported by Extrahladct, provided
that neither side will claim any
reparations. This automatically
eliminates one of the most serious
points of contention in World War
I. Furthermore, the colonial ques
tion will he settled immediately,
with return of several of Ger
many's 1!)14 colonies assured, in a
conference of belligerents.

The third provision said that Su
deten Germany will remain part of
the Reich. Similarly, the Polish cor
ridor, Danzig, and a few other Ger
man-speaking districts which were
part, of 1914 Germany, will remain
with the Nazis.
Austria, however, will hold a
plebiscite on the question of unity
with the Reich, under supervision
of a commission of Austrians, Ger
mans, French, and British. And still
another commission will study the
possibility of establishing the
Czechs, Poles, and Slovaks as small
independent states with a guarantee
never to take up arms against Ger
many. These are the rumors.
Whether or not they be true, no man
knows.
