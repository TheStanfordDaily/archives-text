# Finns Repulse Five Attacks
## Officials Say Soviets Suffer Heavy Losses 
### 
HELSINKI, Feb. (5 (UP). â€”Rus-i
sian losses are mounting "into the I
thousands" in the heaviest fighting!
of the war along a 11-mile battle
front near Surnma, where crack
Russian divisions are trying to blast
a hole in Finland's Mannerheim
Line, according to military reports
direct from the Karelian Isthmus
tonight.
The Finnish high command re
ported in a comunique that five
waves of Russian attacks, led by the
best trained and equipped troops yet
used against the Finns and more
than 100 tanks, were thrown back
yesterday between morning and
midnight by the Mannerheim Line
defenders, with the enemy suffering
heavy casualties and loss of 22
tanks.
RUSSIANS RETREAT
Meanwhile, on the bitterly cold
battlefront northeast of Lake La
doga, Russian units described as
part of the enemy's 18th Division
were reported to be fighting des
perately to break through encircling
Finns and reach their own lines.
Entrapment of the Russians there is
not yet an accomplished fact, but
the Finns are hopeful of a victory
there which would rank with the
biggest of the war.
A young Finnish officer just re
turned from the Mannerheim Line
described tonight how, day and
night for a week, the Russians have
been hurling their heaviest blows
against the line, using 200 bombing
planes at a time, 300 guns, fleets of
150 or more tanks, and 100 "trojan
horse" armored sledges pushed
ahead of the tanks.
LOSSES iiic;ii
The Russians' losses are mount
ing "into the thousands," he said,
while the Finnish casualties are com
paratively small despite the shatter
ing Russian fire.
The Soviet "trojan horses," loaded
with soldiers and plated on lops and
sides with steel, are being blasted to
pieces by anti-tank guns, the offi
cers said.
"The Russians are carrying their
own coffins with them," he added.
On Monday 100 or more of the
armored "trojan horse" sledges
were pushed against the Finnish
lines by Russian tanks but the as
sault was repulsed by anti-tank fire,
machine-guns being as useless as
pop-guns against the queer-looking
monsters.
