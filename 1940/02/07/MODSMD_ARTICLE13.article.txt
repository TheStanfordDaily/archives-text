# 'Y' Plays Vital Role in Rise Of Traditions

Stanofrd without the Cellar? The
pre-reg program? The Frosh bible?
The Roble sponsor system? Wom
en's Clubhouse? Employment Bu
reau? Sophomore luncheons?
Incredible as it may seem, each of
these institutions grew out of a "Y"
activityâ€”serving sandwiches and hot
soup in a basement on the Quad,
programs to help freshmen make
the adjustment to Stanford life,
finding part-time jobs for women
students, converting the attic of an
art building into a rest room and
club room while campaigning for
the present. Women's Clubhouse.
DEPENDS ON CONTRIBUTIONS
In spite of the multiplication of
activities during the past few years,
the "Y" still depends for its run
ning expenses and service funds on
voluntary contributions solicited
during the annual finance drive. The
$700 which "Y" members hope to
raise during this week's campaign
will make it. possible for them to
carry on their activities another
year.
One of the most active groups
within the "Y," the social service
group, has during the past, year
maintained a recreation center at.
the migrant camp at San Jose. Its
members have also visited the set
tlement house in San Francisco and
held discussions with prominent so
cial workers to discover the oppor
tunities and needs in the field.
INTRODUCES NEWCOMERS
Freshman and transfer discus
sion groups still carry on the re
sponsibility of introducing new
women to Stanford life and helping
them to find their places in campus
activities. Acquainting newcomers
with campus dramatics is the spe
cific function of the drama group.
Sophomore luncheons were begun
by the freshman discussion group of
last year who felt the need of keep
ing in touch with widely-scattered
Roble friends.
Two series of discussions spon
sored by the "Y" are arousing par
ticular interest on the campus this
quarter, that on personal philosophy
in which professors are quizzed re
garding their personal beliefs and
philosophies, and one on marriage
and the home, for which various
authorities have led informative
discussions.
PROVIDES MUSIC HOURS
For the musically inclined, the
"Y" provides a program of record
ings each week. This quarter the
music group, under the direction of
Virgil K. Whitaker, professor of
English, will follow the development
of western music.
Each year a large number of
Stanford men and women take part
in the "Y" conference at Asilomar,
and the Stanford "Y" also co-oper
ates to make possible the Workers'
School in San Francisco each sum
mer, when labor leaders and stu
dents from all over the country
gather to study social and economic
problems.
