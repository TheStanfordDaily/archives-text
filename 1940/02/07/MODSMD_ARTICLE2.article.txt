# Student Aid Scholarships Cut $7,500
## Atherton's Rulings Will Bar Further B.A.C. Contributions 
### 
The slashing of approximately
$7,500 from scholarship funds for
the coming year to athletes and
other students receiving funds
through the Student Aid Commis
sion from Stanford University was
disclosed yesterday.
Approximately 175 students re
ceive over $20,000 from the Univer
sity each year in scholarships.
The cuts were caused by changes
in policy affecting two main sources
of revenue:
1. Recent rulings by Edwin N.
Atherton, Pacific Coast Intercol
legiate Athletic Conference czar,
will act as an injunction against
the Stanford Board of Athletic
Control in prohibiting the for
warding of profits from athletic
contests to the Student Aid Com
mission. These profits amounted
to $5,000 last year.
2. The Stanford Bookstore, a co
operative organization, will de
clare a profit rebate to all patrons
on a 5 per cent basis at the con
clusion of the school year in June,
as contrasted with its past' policy
o* dividing profits between the
Student Aid Commission, the Uni
versity Loan Fund, and the Schol
arship Commission. Last year the
Student Aid Commission received
$2,500 of the Bookstore profits.
These profits totaled $7,500.
Just how many scholarships, ath
letic or otherwise, will be curtailed
in the future by these actions could
not be ascertained by Mr. Karl
Cowdery, associate registrar and
academic secretary, who released
the information in connection with
the Student Aid Commission.
"The only direct effect of the new
Conference rules is that the B.A.C.
must not contribute any money to
student aid," said Mr. Cowdery.
"This will mean a difference of
$5,000 to the Student Aid Commis
sion next year as compared with
funds contributed during the present
school year.
"However, there will be no direct,
effect on the Student Aid Commis
sion itself; its policies and practices
will not be changed by the Con
ference ruling," he added.
PROCEDURE OUTLINED ,
Mr. Cowdery explained that if any
athletes are to get help, the aid
must not come from athletic sources,
and that, in assigning scholarships
the Commission will consider solely
the student's scholarship and need
for aid, as it docs for all other ap
plicants.
The only other legal method of
granting scholarships is by means of
alumni or other outside sponsorship
of an applicant, so long as the ap
plicant is sponsored by a non-ath
letic source.
Such contributions would go into
the University funds, such as the
Buck-of-the-Month Club, and ad
mission of the applicant would be
subject to approval by the Univer- |
| sity, according to Mr. Cowdery. Ap- |
! proval is subject to satisfactory
1 evidence of scholarship and need.
RULING STATED
"If such a sponsor were to sup
port a student, he could not legally
stipulate that the student partake in '
athletics, and should the student
fail to make a team, or otherwise
prove dissatisfactory to his sponsor,
he could not be withdrawn imme
-1 diatelj'."
Mr. Cowdery outlined that to
qualify for help from the Student
I Aid Commission a student must be
at least partially self-supporting, and
have a C average. He does not have j
| to be an athlete.

Professor D. E. Faville, president

Professor Faville added that in
the last four years Bookstore profits
have contributed $24,500 toward
scholarship grants, providing $19,500
lor student aid, and dividing the
balance, $5,000, between graduate
loan funds and the scholarship fund.

2. The Stanford Bookstore, a co

on a 5 per cent basis at the con

as contrasted with its past' policy
o* dividing profits between the
Student Aid Commission, the Uni

Student Aid Commission received
$2,500 of the Bookstore profits.
These profits totaled $7,500.
Just how many scholarships, ath

in the future by these actions could
not be ascertained by Mr. Karl
Cowdery, associate registrar and

the information in connection with
the Student Aid Commission.
"The only direct effect of the new
Conference rules is that the B.A.C.
must not contribute any money to
student aid," said Mr. Cowdery.
"This will mean a difference of
$5,000 to the Student Aid Commis
sion next year as compared with
funds contributed during the present
school year.
"However, there will be no direct,
effect on the Student Aid Commis

PROCEDURE OUTLINED ,
Mr. Cowdery explained that if any
athletes are to get help, the aid
must not come from athletic sources,
and that, in assigning scholarships
the Commission will consider solely
the student's scholarship and need
for aid, as it docs for all other ap
plicants.
The only other legal method of
granting scholarships is by means of
alumni or other outside sponsorship
of an applicant, so long as the ap
plicant is sponsored by a non-ath
letic source.
Such contributions would go into
the University funds, such as the
Buck-of-the-Month Club, and ad
mission of the applicant would be
subject to approval by the Univer- |
| sity, according to Mr. Cowdery. Ap- |
! proval is subject to satisfactory
1 evidence of scholarship and need.

PROFITS LISTED
Professor D. E. Faville, president
1 of the Bookstore board, stated that
j the 5 per cent rebate in June will
| be from profits of the school year
| 1939-40.
Professor Faville added that in
the last four years Bookstore profits
have contributed $24,500 toward
scholarship grants, providing $19,500
lor student aid, and dividing the
balance, $5,000, between graduate
loan funds and the scholarship fund.
The slashing of approximately
$7,500 from scholarship funds for
the coming year to athletes and
other students receiving funds
through the Student Aid Commis
sion from Stanford University was
disclosed yesterday.
Approximately 175 students re
ceive over $20,000 from the Univer
sity each year in scholarships.
The cuts were caused by changes
in policy affecting two main sources
of revenue:
1. Recent rulings by Edwin N.
Atherton, Pacific Coast Intercol
legiate Athletic Conference czar,
will act as an injunction against
the Stanford Board of Athletic
Control in prohibiting the for
warding of profits from athletic
contests to the Student Aid Com

academic secretary, who released
the information in connection with
the Student Aid Commission.
"The only direct effect of the new
Conference rules is that the B.A.C.
must not contribute any money to
student aid," said Mr. Cowdery.
"This will mean a difference of
$5,000 to the Student Aid Commis
sion next year as compared with
funds contributed during the present
school year.
"However, there will be no direct,
effect on the Student Aid Commis
sion itself; its policies and practices
will not be changed by the Con
ference ruling," he added.
PROCEDURE OUTLINED ,
Mr. Cowdery explained that if any
athletes are to get help, the aid
must not come from athletic sources,
and that, in assigning scholarships
the Commission will consider solely
the student's scholarship and need
for aid, as it docs for all other ap
plicants.
The only other legal method of
granting scholarships is by means of
alumni or other outside sponsorship
of an applicant, so long as the ap
plicant is sponsored by a non-ath
letic source.
Such contributions would go into
the University funds, such as the
Buck-of-the-Month Club, and ad
mission of the applicant would be
subject to approval by the Univer- |
| sity, according to Mr. Cowdery. Ap- |
! proval is subject to satisfactory
1 evidence of scholarship and need.
RULING STATED
"If such a sponsor were to sup
port a student, he could not legally
stipulate that the student partake in '
athletics, and should the student
fail to make a team, or otherwise
prove dissatisfactory to his sponsor,
he could not be withdrawn imme
-1 diatelj'."
Mr. Cowdery outlined that to
qualify for help from the Student
I Aid Commission a student must be
at least partially self-supporting, and
have a C average. He does not have j
| to be an athlete.
PROFITS LISTED
Professor D. E. Faville, president
1 of the Bookstore board, stated that
j the 5 per cent rebate in June will
| be from profits of the school year
| 1939-40.
Professor Faville added that in
the last four years Bookstore profits
have contributed $24,500 toward
scholarship grants, providing $19,500
lor student aid, and dividing the
balance, $5,000, between graduate
loan funds and the scholarship fund.
