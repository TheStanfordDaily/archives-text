# Democrats Meet In Washington

### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 6 (UP).—
Democratic National Committeemen
and party workers, here to open the
1940 White House campaign, shook
hands with President Roosevelt to
day but left for home with no an
swer to the nation's most baffling
political question: Will he seek a
third term?
The President exchanged greetings
and quips with state chairmen soon
after he had returned from a week
end rest at his Hyde Park, N.Y.,
home. Later Mrs. Roosevelt received
the committeemen and committee
women who yesterday voted to hold
this year's nominating convention in
Chicago, 111., where Mr. Roosevelt
was nominated in 1932.
Among the callers were several
openly plumping for a third term;
some lukewarm and some privately
opposed, and two candidates for the
nomination —Vice-President John N.
Garner and National Chairman
James A. Farley. As far as could he
learned the issue was not raised by
the visitors and Mr. Roosevelt vol
unteered no information.
