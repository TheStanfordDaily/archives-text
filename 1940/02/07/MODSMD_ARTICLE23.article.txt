# Excom Goes on Record As Opposed to A.S.S.U. Support of Finn Benefit
## Committee Decides Planned Local Relief Program Violates Precedent; Stress Laid on Neutrality Angle 
### DICK DUDMAN 
If tlie University holds a Finnish relief program Feb. 15, the affair will
be without the official student body support or approval.
Last night Ex Committee turned down an application for a date by
the newly-formed Finnish Relief Committee and refused to make the
proposed entertainment a student body activity.

, The final motion, passed by the
committee after it had rejected sev
eral others, follows:
"Sincc it is an established A.S.S.U.
policy not to participate in parti
san causes, wo decline to make the
proposed entertainment a student
body activity."
NEUTRALITY SOUGHT
Recalling former Ex Committee
decisions on similar questions, mem
bers agreed the body has tried to
remain neutral and consistently re
fused aicl to partisan causes, al
though occasionally the committee
has denied appeals and then haÂ«
recommended informal support by
individual students.
"Always before we have said we
hoped students would give a drive
their support," Coline Upshaw said.
"Shouldn't we say that now?"
She was answered by a practically
unanimous "No."
The controversy arose out of a
routine application for a date. Bruce
Jessup, representing the Finnish
Relief Committee, applied to Ex
Committee for a date, Feb. 15, from
8 to 9 o'clock.
TRUEBLOOD HEADS GROUP
President Ken Cuthbertson told
members of Ex Committee the Finn
ish Relief Committee is a student
faculty organization headed by D.
Elton Trueblood, Stanford chaplain.
First objection to the granting of
official A.S.S.U. support to the pro
gram was raised by Bob Putnam.
"I don't like fund drives for Fimi
ish relief, Chinese relief, or any
other kind of relief but American
relief," he declared.
"It wouldn't be neutral, and that
is what we are supposed to be,"
Mollie West commented.
HOOVER TOUCH SEEN
A member asked if perhaps he
didn't "see Mr. Hoover's hand in
this Finnish relief entertainment."
Cuthbertson replied that, although
Mr. Hoover's connection with relief
work past and present may have
been an influence, the local program
was started by Dr. Trueblood, Dr.
Wilbur, and interested students.
At, the opening of the discussion
several members said they feared to
take any action that might be con
strued by outsiders as opposition to
Finnish relief in general and result,
in unfavorable publicity for the Uni
versity. Larry Livingston, Daily
editor, condemned this attitude.
IMPORTANCE STRESSED
"This is the most important deci
sion the committee has had to make
this year, and it's no time to back
slide for fear of bad publicity," he
said. "There's a war in Europe and
this may lead to getting us into it."
Dr. Trueblood, asked by Dr. Wil
bur to head the relief committee,
said last night he considered Ex
Committee's decision a "snap judg
ment.
"It's a terrible thing for Stanford
to be the university that doesn't
when all the others do, especially
since Mr. Hoover is at Stanford," lie
declared.
TEN ON COMMITTEE
The relief committee met for thn
first time yesterday, he said. It was
composed of five students and five
faculty members.
"There's no use holding the pro
gram," said Dr. Trueblood, "unless
the students of Stanford want it. We
hit this unexpected snag that nobody
had dreamed of."
