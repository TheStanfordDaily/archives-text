TWO WRECKED RUSSIAN tanks (above) are abandoned when Finnish troops swooped down on the
Soviet's 44th Division on the road to Suoniussalmi. Finland, and wiped it out. In front of tanks is the body
of a Russian soldier frozen into the grotesque position by intense cold. lielow, blankets, wagons, tanks, and
tractors are abandoned by retreating practically annihilated 44th Division.
