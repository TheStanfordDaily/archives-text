# Swain Predicts Extension Of All Socialized Medicine
## 
### 
"There is no place for hostility in the field of science; science recog-t
nizes no natural boundaries," explained Robert E. Swain, Stanford pro
fessor of chemistry, to the audience of the Tuesday Evening Series last
night. From this he drew his prophesy that the nations of the world will
learn from the fields of research.
Edwin W. Schultz, professor of bacteriology and experimental pathol
ogy, drew attention to the international spirit of science and went on to

the extension of socialized
| medicine and remarked upon the
shift of medical research from war
; distracted Europe to the United
States.
WHAT OF IT?
He pictured the world before the
j recent advances in science, before
I the knowledge of anesthesia, mi
l crobes good and bad, nutrition, and
| dentists, "hated for what they are
! about to do and loved for what they
i have just done."
j "And what of it?" people some
| times ask scientists when they are
shown the bottles of fruit flies with
I many-colored eyes or tanks of tiny
salamanders. Dr. Charles V. Tay
j lor pointed out that many of the
greatest scientific discoveries have
been stumbled upon quite by acci
dent and the basic knowledge for all
j of them has been pieced together by
• innumerable such experiments.
I IMPORTANCE OF CELL
He continued to explain how the
common unit of the cell related all
i the discoveries of biological science
and made them applicable to our
I present-day society.
"And it is to these laws that final
| appeal must be made," Dr. Taylor
concluded in his summary of the
: probable influence science will have
| in governing the society of tomorrow.
