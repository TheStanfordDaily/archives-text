# Tides Wash Out Newport Seawall
## 
### 
. NEWPORT, Ore., Feb. (5 (UP).â€”
Mountainous tides whipped up by
storms in the North Pacific today
washed out a 500-foot section of the
! concrete seawall protecting the beach
town of Newport. It was feared that
the remainder of the wall would
collapse if the tides continued.
Although the destruction of the
I wall exposed the surfaced shore
| drive to the tides, it was not believed
: any dwellings or business houses
I were in immediate danger.
