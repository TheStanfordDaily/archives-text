i sion attributed to the outlawed Irish !

DEMAND UNION
The executions, bringing loud pro- I
I tests from Ireland, may lead to re
| newed widespread violence in the '
I l.R.A.'s demand for a union of Eire I
j —the former Irish Free State—and I
i Northern Ireland, or Ulster.
Every available man of Scotland I
j Yard's "ClD"—the G-men of Brit- I
, ain—was on duty today as the hour j
jof the executions neared. Nearly |
1 10,000 were held in readiness in the i
j London area and throughout the
; country there were other elaborate j
j precautions.
