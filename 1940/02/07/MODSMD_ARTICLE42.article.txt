# Stanford Quintet Favored To Win Friday Night's 'Big Game' Casaba Clash
## Freshman Outfits to Trade Shots In Big Double-header at California Pavilion; Bears Change Line-up 
### 
Rivalry and tradition—of the Real McCoy brand—will be combined in
the neatest double-header of the current basketball season Friday night.
First of all we have the second game of the Stanford-California basket
ball feud and a capacity crowd of 0000 is scheduled to watch it. Then
we have the future varsit> Indian and Hear cage teams battling in the

preliminary, the treshmen meeting,
in the first of three games.
Coach Everett Dean's varsity al
ready has one leg over the Cal
hurdle, having copped the first
game, 55-32, at a time when the
Bear behemoths were having their
downs. Since that time they've been
chiefly on the up-grade.
That last .meeting found the
Bears in bad condition and poor
morale after almost successive beat
ings in the East and in Los Angeles.
Stanford, playing a top-notch game
and acting the part of one of the
smoothest outfits on the Coast, was
easily the master of Coach Nibs
Price's quintet.
BEARS REVAMPED
The Bears started revamping im
mediately. Friday their line-up
will be materially changed from
forward to guard. Only veterans
Bickerton and Ogilvie will remain
at their did positions at guard and
center.
Loss of Chalmers and Thomas
from last year's team stymied the
Bears' attack in the front line. So
Bill Biggerstaff, the former 6-foot
ti-inch guard, was moved to forward
and a transfer named Tamm went to
the other forward post. They've
made these positions really danger
ous from the scoring point of view.
NEW CAL STAR
A really fine defensive and of
fensive guard has been found in Irv
Hodes to make up for Biggerstaff's
moving to forward. Thus radically
changed, the Bears will present a
stronger club against the Indians.
The Stanfords will make a bid to
improve their play with Fordy An
derson scheduled to make a brief
appearance in the line-up after
.spending a week in bed and a week
getting back in shape. The Card
line-up will start with the same
men who played in the San Fran
cisco double-headers.
With Monday off. Coach Dean put
the cagers through a drill yester
day afternoon and has another one
lined up for this afternoon. The
varsity is scheduled to rest again
1 omorrow.

smoothest outfits on the Coast, was
easily the master of Coach Nibs
Price's quintet.
BEARS REVAMPED
The Bears started revamping im
mediately. Friday their line-up
will be materially changed from
forward to guard. Only veterans
Bickerton and Ogilvie will remain
at their did positions at guard and
center.
Loss of Chalmers and Thomas
from last year's team stymied the
Bears' attack in the front line. So
Bill Biggerstaff, the former 6-foot
ti-inch guard, was moved to forward
and a transfer named Tamm went to
the other forward post. They've
made these positions really danger
ous from the scoring point of view.
NEW CAL STAR
A really fine defensive and of
fensive guard has been found in Irv
Hodes to make up for Biggerstaff's
moving to forward. Thus radically
changed, the Bears will present a
stronger club against the Indians.
The Stanfords will make a bid to
improve their play with Fordy An
derson scheduled to make a brief
appearance in the line-up after
.spending a week in bed and a week
getting back in shape. The Card
line-up will start with the same
men who played in the San Fran
cisco double-headers.
With Monday off. Coach Dean put
the cagers through a drill yester
day afternoon and has another one
lined up for this afternoon. The
varsity is scheduled to rest again
1 omorrow.
Rivalry and tradition—of the Real McCoy brand—will be combined in
the neatest double-header of the current basketball season Friday night.
First of all we have the second game of the Stanford-California basket
ball feud and a capacity crowd of 0000 is scheduled to watch it. Then
we have the future varsit> Indian and Hear cage teams battling in the

preliminary, the treshmen meeting,
in the first of three games.
Coach Everett Dean's varsity al
ready has one leg over the Cal
hurdle, having copped the first
game, 55-32, at a time when the
Bear behemoths were having their
downs. Since that time they've been
chiefly on the up-grade.
That last .meeting found the
Bears in bad condition and poor
morale after almost successive beat
ings in the East and in Los Angeles.
Stanford, playing a top-notch game
and acting the part of one of the
smoothest outfits on the Coast, was
easily the master of Coach Nibs
Price's quintet.
