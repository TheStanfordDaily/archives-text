# Schedule Mix-up Nets Double Bill
## 
### 
Stanford's athletic management
found itself in an embarrassing po
sition Monday when they discov
ered that the U.S.F. grid opener,
set, for Kezar Stadium Sept. 28, had
been scheduled for a place and date
already taken by neighboring Santa
Clara for the Bronco's inaugural
with Utah.
The three local schools have de
cided to take the easiest way out
and have upset all football prece
dent by agreeing to a double
header. Only Utah's acceptance is
now required to make the event a
sure thing.
