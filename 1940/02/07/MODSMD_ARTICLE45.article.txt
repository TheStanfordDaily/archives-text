# Freshman Cage Hopes on Rise For Cal Tilt
## Coach Lee Changes Ed Voss to Forward; Northon Out with Flu 
### 
! Following their strong showing
against Piedmont High School last
j Saturday night, stock in Stanford's
j freshman basketball team took a
! sudden rise. And chances for a vic
tory against the Cal Cubs now loom
bri' t, according to Beeb Lee, frosh
i mentor.
With the exception of Dick North
-1 on, reserve center, who is out with
the flu, the Papoose cagers are in
j good physical condition. Lee is also
I of the opinion that the mental atti
! tude of his charges has improved
| quite a bit for their coming all -
| important contest against their arch
[ rivals from across the bay.
At the present time there are four
| first-string men in the front line.
| They are Ed Stamm, Ed Voss, Jack
1 Dana, and Fred Linari. Among
I them they will divide the work at
[ the center and two forward posts,
j However, only three of them can
j start, and Lee hasn't decided just
i which three it will be.
In order that he may get a larger
i variety of combinations on the floor,
! Coach Lee has big Ed Voss working
I at forward as well as at his old cen-
I ter spot. He will play both posi
j tions. Leo McCaffrey and Walt
I Funabiki are still top men at the
! guard posts.
