# Farm Diamondmen to Tangle With U.S.F. Dons Here Today
## 
### 
Sid Hayes is slated to start on the j
mound if the Stanford baseball team
i>lays a practice game with the Uni- I
versity of San Francisco Dons on
the Sunken Diamond this afternoon. :
Starting time will be 3:15 o'clock if
the infield dries out enough for the
diamondmen to play their first train
ing tilt in two weeks.
Harry Wolter will start what he j
considers his strongest nine against i
the Dons. Hal Costello at first, Harry
Parsons at second, Elton Boone at |
third, and Monty Pfyl at short make ;
up what seems likely to be the reg- j
ular infield when the league season !
opens.
Norm Juney will open in left field, i
Alex Cereghino will start in center, '

and Jim Verdieck will get the call in
right. This trio tops the outfield
prospects so far. Juney was an out
fielder for a time last year until he
shifted to first. He's a good
hitter with men on the bases and
an experienced fielder.
Cereghino is a junior college
transfer who has looked good in the
two practice games the Cards played
between rains. In those tilts
"Cherry" played great defensive ball
and connected for several base hits.
Verdieck is a powerful hitter who
should give opposing chuckers
something to think about.
Herb Atkinson will don the "tools
of ignorance" to catch Hayes for
the first few innings. Hayes is divid-
