# Peace Insurance

### 
LAST night Ex Committee deliberately took
the strongest, most effective stand for peace
that has been made on the Stanford campus
since the European war began.
Refusing to give the official sanction of the
A.S.S.U. to a University plan to hold a Finnish
Relief benefit on the campus, the student repre
sentatives expressed their definite belief that
any such program would be non-neutral and
might serve to draw the United States into war.
One might go so far as to term this inde
pendent attitude of Ex Committee's morally
courageous, for in taking it, the members knew
they were throwing a hitch into the Adminis
tration's plan and opposing the favorite project
of Stanford's most famous son.
Yet, despite these pressure points and de
spite the fact that other colleges throughout the
country are holding such benefits, Ex Commit
tee held fast to its carefully thought-out prece
dent of giving no aid to partisan causes.
No one can deny that feeding and clothing
needy citizens of invaded Finland is an ex
tremely worthy and important cause. But un
fortunately just now the Finns are engaged in
an international conflict, a war into which the
United States might easily be drawn.
It would be both provincial and selfish to say
that Americans should contribute nothing to
the victims of war on the other side of the
Atlantic. And Stanford students give evidence
that they harbor no such belief when they
contributed to the Red Cross, an organization
which distributes funds solely according to
need, whether it be in Finland, in Germany, in
England, or in Russia.
Raising funds for Finland today is comparable
to making donations for Belgian relief in
1915. Although at first we gave only sympathy
and cash, it was not long before we started
sending our men.
This could easily happen again.
That is why Ex Committee was wise last night
in helping to insure that the Yanks are not
coming.
