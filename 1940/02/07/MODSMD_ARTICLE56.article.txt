THE Stanford Bookstore's decision to cease
contributions to the Student Aid Fund,
coupled with an announcement of the B.A.C.
that the new conference rules prevent its sup
porting the cause any longer, is an extremely
unhappy turn of events.
For years Student Aid scholarships have en
abled athletes and non-athletes alike to remain
in the school of their choosing when other finan
cial sources let them down. The unfortunate
student who had a C average, a good University
record, and a pressing need looked upon Stu
dent Aid as practical insurance for his future in
college.
In four years the Bookstore has given $19,500
to the fund. Last year, when 175 individual
scholarships were given, the Board of Athletic
Control gave $5000, for the use of both athletes
and non-athletes.
The position of the B.A.C. is easily under
stood when you realize that the Atherton code
prohibits any donations to sources from which
athletes may draw. But the Bookstore's posi
tion is much more difficult to explain.
The Bookstore organization, in deciding to
issue student rebates up to 5 per cent of the
purchase price, is merely attempting to give the
students something in return for their patronage.
If they continue to contribute to Student Aid,
they will not be considered as operating a co
operative enterprise in the eyes of tax-collecting
government officials.
The amount of those taxes would eat up any
profits that might be given to the Student Aid
Fund.
Thus its only chance to share those profits is
by offering a rebate. The average student will
be lucky to get as much as a measly two dol
lars in three quarters. And nearly two hundred
Fund recipients are going to face a crisis that
will undoubtedly endanger their chances of
graduating from Stanford.
Undoubtedly alumni and students will rally
to some plan which will continue to finance the
most democratic award scheme that the Farm
has to offer.
Bookstore purchase slips might be deposited
in central containers and the dividends then
turned over to the Commission for Student Aid
and used as they have been in the past. Two
dollars is a small price to pay for the academic
success of 200 needy scholarship recipients.—

unhappy turn of events.
For years Student Aid scholarships have en
abled athletes and non-athletes alike to remain
in the school of their choosing when other finan
cial sources let them down. The unfortunate
student who had a C average, a good University
record, and a pressing need looked upon Stu
dent Aid as practical insurance for his future in
college.
In four years the Bookstore has given $19,500
to the fund. Last year, when 175 individual
scholarships were given, the Board of Athletic
Control gave $5000, for the use of both athletes
and non-athletes.
The position of the B.A.C. is easily under
stood when you realize that the Atherton code
prohibits any donations to sources from which
athletes may draw. But the Bookstore's posi
tion is much more difficult to explain.
The Bookstore organization, in deciding to
issue student rebates up to 5 per cent of the
purchase price, is merely attempting to give the
students something in return for their patronage.
If they continue to contribute to Student Aid,
they will not be considered as operating a co
operative enterprise in the eyes of tax-collecting
government officials.
The amount of those taxes would eat up any
profits that might be given to the Student Aid
Fund.
Thus its only chance to share those profits is
by offering a rebate. The average student will
be lucky to get as much as a measly two dol
lars in three quarters. And nearly two hundred
Fund recipients are going to face a crisis that
will undoubtedly endanger their chances of
graduating from Stanford.
Undoubtedly alumni and students will rally
to some plan which will continue to finance the
most democratic award scheme that the Farm
has to offer.
Bookstore purchase slips might be deposited
in central containers and the dividends then
turned over to the Commission for Student Aid
and used as they have been in the past. Two
dollars is a small price to pay for the academic
success of 200 needy scholarship recipients.—
THE Stanford Bookstore's decision to cease
contributions to the Student Aid Fund,
coupled with an announcement of the B.A.C.
that the new conference rules prevent its sup
porting the cause any longer, is an extremely
unhappy turn of events.

abled athletes and non-athletes alike to remain
