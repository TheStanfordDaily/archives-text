IF The Daily today ran a front page story say
ing 11 men and women had been elected to
the 11 A.S.S.U. positions to be voted on next
week, it would mean absolutely nothing to
anyone but the 11 persons whose names were
listed.
That would be the case, judging from the
interest in this mid-winter election being evi
denced by the campus at large.
Late last night the Halls did pick a slate, but
there was a time when they wouldn't have
waited until the second night of nominations to
do this.
The Row so far has done absolutely nothing.
More than that, the houses don't even seem to
be guite aware that there is an election coming
up—and that is true as well for the majority
of Hall men, at least.
Some people will claim this relative absence
of caucuses is a Utopian sign, an indication that
Farm politics are clean and idealistic. But no
matter what you say against Hall-Row political
rabble-rousing, such a condition does indicate
definite interest in an election; interest in the
people running, and the offices they are to fill.
There is little of that this year.
It is even impossible to find out at this date
exactly who will be running. The election
board chairman ran up to the City last night to
play some kind of a you-can't-find-me game with
the sophomores from his fraternity—without
bothering to open up the nomination boxes and
announce the first round returns. —D. J.
