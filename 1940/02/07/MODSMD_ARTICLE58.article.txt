### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
CHICAGO GETS THE CIRCUS
CUNNY JIM FARLEY and the boys are going to
move in on Chicago. Many cities vied for the
honor of entertaining the Democratic Convention, but
the Kelly-Nash machine swung the deal for the windy
city's hotel owners and activity-hungry business men.
Philadelphia made a strong bid, earning thirty-eight
votes to Chicago's forty-eight. And Houston, Texas,
made a feeble and futile thrust in the interests of
their favorite son, John "Cactus Jack" Gamer. Hous
ton piled up all of two votes, one of which was
Garner's.
These national conventions are exciting, brawling
festivals—open hunting grounds! for political sharp
shooters and big-time cigar-chewers. Publicity men
think up shows for the public, ranging from the usual
banner-waving to loose-hipped dancers (as tried by
the Garner delegation in 1932).
And behind the scenes old-line party bosses make
trades and patronage-deals. There is lots of oppor
tunity for political piracy and back-stabbing revenge.
If your name is McAdoo and a Tammany politician
named Smith cuts you out of a nomination in your
prime, you just wait until you control a nice bunch
of convention delegates when Smith wants something.
Then at the last minute you swing your power from
Garner to Roosevelt, and you leave this "Happy War
rior" Smith hung out on a limb, grumbling and glow
ering and not "happy" at all. It's just as good as a
Stanford caucus.

JIM FARLEY hasn't announced the date of the Demo
cratic convention yet. He's going to wait until the
Republicans decide on the time for their convention.
This obviously leaves an opening for the Republican
gag mep. "What a sad spectacle," says John D. M.
Hamilton, "a party has been in power for seven and a
half years and it can't even decide when it wants to
have its convention. It has to wait for the minority
party to give it a cue."
And tomorrow Charley Michelson, the brains be
hind the Democratic machine, will probably write a
sarcastic little squib for one of the Democratic spokes
men—telling Hamilton he has a lot more to worry
about than the date of the Democratic convention.
Back and forth the national big-wigs will banter and
maneuver. It's all a great game. The conventions ax-e
big circuses.
But the campaigners who engage in this political
sport are not playing for cupie dolls or blue ribbons.
They are playing for rather expensive political plums,
and out of the whirl will come a man whose job it will
be to lead the country against unemployment, economic
maladjustment, and the danger of getting into war.
Our chief executives are set against a background of
log-rollers, sharpsters, and circuses.
The onlv compensation is a look elsewhere. In some
countries they have circuses at which it is the custom
to stab people with real, steel knives and to shoot
opponents with very real guns.
Politics is great—the world over.

CHICAGO GETS THE CIRCUS
CUNNY JIM FARLEY and the boys are going to
move in on Chicago. Many cities vied for the
honor of entertaining the Democratic Convention, but
the Kelly-Nash machine swung the deal for the windy
city's hotel owners and activity-hungry business men.
Philadelphia made a strong bid, earning thirty-eight
votes to Chicago's forty-eight. And Houston, Texas,
made a feeble and futile thrust in the interests of
their favorite son, John "Cactus Jack" Gamer. Hous
ton piled up all of two votes, one of which was
Garner's.
These national conventions are exciting, brawling
festivals—open hunting grounds! for political sharp
shooters and big-time cigar-chewers. Publicity men
think up shows for the public, ranging from the usual
banner-waving to loose-hipped dancers (as tried by
the Garner delegation in 1932).
And behind the scenes old-line party bosses make
trades and patronage-deals. There is lots of oppor
tunity for political piracy and back-stabbing revenge.
If your name is McAdoo and a Tammany politician
named Smith cuts you out of a nomination in your
prime, you just wait until you control a nice bunch
of convention delegates when Smith wants something.
Then at the last minute you swing your power from
Garner to Roosevelt, and you leave this "Happy War
rior" Smith hung out on a limb, grumbling and glow
ering and not "happy" at all. It's just as good as a
Stanford caucus.

JIM FARLEY hasn't announced the date of the Demo
cratic convention yet. He's going to wait until the
Republicans decide on the time for their convention.
This obviously leaves an opening for the Republican
gag mep. "What a sad spectacle," says John D. M.
Hamilton, "a party has been in power for seven and a
half years and it can't even decide when it wants to
have its convention. It has to wait for the minority
party to give it a cue."
And tomorrow Charley Michelson, the brains be
hind the Democratic machine, will probably write a
sarcastic little squib for one of the Democratic spokes
men—telling Hamilton he has a lot more to worry
about than the date of the Democratic convention.
Back and forth the national big-wigs will banter and
maneuver. It's all a great game. The conventions ax-e
big circuses.
But the campaigners who engage in this political
sport are not playing for cupie dolls or blue ribbons.
They are playing for rather expensive political plums,
and out of the whirl will come a man whose job it will
be to lead the country against unemployment, economic
maladjustment, and the danger of getting into war.
Our chief executives are set against a background of
log-rollers, sharpsters, and circuses.
The onlv compensation is a look elsewhere. In some
countries they have circuses at which it is the custom
to stab people with real, steel knives and to shoot
opponents with very real guns.
