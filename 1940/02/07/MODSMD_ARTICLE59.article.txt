# CAMPUS OPINION
## D-1 AND D-2 COME THROUGH 
### 
r JTHE EDITOR, SIR:
A cogitate reflection of Mr. Mellinkoff's reprisal
to my letter would seem to express the opinion that
only those inspired from above; only those who pos
sess a sweeping linguistic style, should feel at liberty
to contribute to this column. That would indeed be a
dirty shame, for hardly one letter would be published
per month.
If we have to argue about style and rhetoric, let
us glance over the specimen submitted by filibusterers
Herb Casey and B. Ambrose. Please note the last
paragraph in Casey's letter. Would one call that gram
matically perfect? Nor can I credit B. Ambrose with
the contribution of an erudite "belle-lettre." (That is
French borrowed from Latin, Shermie!) It is not mis
taken that both of these men signed their names after
their statements; Herb Casey calling me a dastardly
coward for not publishing mine.

A FTER ALL, Herb, you are in a much better posi
tion than I to sign your name; and besides, isn't
God on your side?
Sherman's conception of the pyromaniac was very
amusing and also*•%•*>; y*saitastically exaggerated. You
sturdy pioneers, you robust men who advocate the
principle of self-reliance coupled with hitch-hiking
would be surprised to know that I earned every cent
of tho $1000 which I paid for my car. Perhaps if
"Nickel-Beer" MellinkofF had a similar car he would
learn to take care of it, and even he would be a trifle
ired when some campus ringer burned a hole in his
upholstery. Or, Sherman, do you want to start a cru
sade among "our unfortunates to buy seat covers to
help offset the "Stanford Man's Burden"?
Sincerely yours,
'40 Living in Paly
P.a.: I can give you a good deal on the Brooklyn
Bridge, Sherm.
