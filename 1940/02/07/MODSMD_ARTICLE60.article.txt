# Selznick Works Wonders In 'Gone With The Wind'
## 
### 
"GONE WITH THE WIND," now playing at the VVarfield Theater in
San Francisco.
For most of the hundred and thirty million people in these United
States, there's magic in the very title. With the possible exception of
"Snow White." no motion picture has ever been as impatiently awaited

as the Selznick version of Margaret
Mitchell's "Gone With the Wind."
Now that it's here, those who have
seen it, including your reviewer, are |
at a loss for words. It's a dangerous I
business to describe any man-made
masterpiece as "perfect," but the
emotional effect of nearly four
hours of being completely engrossed
in the lives of many gallant people
leaves one in no mood for destruc
tive criticism.
ENTIRE CAST PRAISED
Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh
are undoubtedly magnificent actors,
but the greatness of their present
performances lies not in their ability
to create characters but in their
faithfulness to the vivid characters !
already familiar to millions. The
suave Captain Butler, the green-eyed
girl with her passion for living seem
to have been lifted bodily from the
pages of the book.
Too much can not be said in praise
of the entire cast. Mention of ex
cellent individual performances
could be almost endless, but seems
hardly appropriate. The most re
markable thing about the production
is the complete co-operation of
every member of the cast.
SCRIPT FOLLOWS NOVEL
Technically, "Gone With the j
Wind" couldn't be better. It's a
photographer's holiday throughout, |
and some of the scenic effects are as j
fine as you'll see in a long time. !
Keep an eye open particularly for \
the camera angles on Scarlett when j
she swears she'll never be poor j
again.
The late Sidney Howard did an
excellent job on the script. It fol- !
lows Miss Mitchell's story so faith- I
fully that one forgets to notice the
omission of two babies and various
other details. Incidentally, the Hayes
office was away on vacation during
most of the filming.
It's your reviewer's guess that be
fore long not having seen ".Gone
With the Wind" will be considered
as bad a social error as not having
read the book.—Pat Smith

suave Captain Butler, the green-eyed
girl with her passion for living seem
to have been lifted bodily from the
pages of the book.
Too much can not be said in praise
of the entire cast. Mention of ex
cellent individual performances
could be almost endless, but seems
hardly appropriate. The most re
markable thing about the production
is the complete co-operation of
every member of the cast.
SCRIPT FOLLOWS NOVEL
Technically, "Gone With the j
Wind" couldn't be better. It's a
photographer's holiday throughout, |
and some of the scenic effects are as j
fine as you'll see in a long time. !
Keep an eye open particularly for \
the camera angles on Scarlett when j
she swears she'll never be poor j
again.
The late Sidney Howard did an
excellent job on the script. It fol- !
lows Miss Mitchell's story so faith- I
fully that one forgets to notice the
omission of two babies and various
other details. Incidentally, the Hayes
office was away on vacation during
most of the filming.
It's your reviewer's guess that be
fore long not having seen ".Gone
With the Wind" will be considered
as bad a social error as not having
read the book.—Pat Smith
"GONE WITH THE WIND," now playing at the VVarfield Theater in
San Francisco.
For most of the hundred and thirty million people in these United
States, there's magic in the very title. With the possible exception of
"Snow White." no motion picture has ever been as impatiently awaited

as the Selznick version of Margaret
Mitchell's "Gone With the Wind."
Now that it's here, those who have
seen it, including your reviewer, are |
at a loss for words. It's a dangerous I
business to describe any man-made
masterpiece as "perfect," but the
emotional effect of nearly four
hours of being completely engrossed
in the lives of many gallant people
leaves one in no mood for destruc
tive criticism.
ENTIRE CAST PRAISED
Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh
are undoubtedly magnificent actors,
but the greatness of their present
performances lies not in their ability
to create characters but in their
faithfulness to the vivid characters !
already familiar to millions. The
suave Captain Butler, the green-eyed
girl with her passion for living seem
to have been lifted bodily from the
pages of the book.
