# Geology Field Trip Open to All Students
## 
### 
Students interested in making a
field trip to Selby Smelter Friday
are asked to sign up in the mining
or geology buildings. Since members
will leave from the mining building
at 8:30 o'clock Friday morning to be
gone all day, they are advised to
provide lunches.
