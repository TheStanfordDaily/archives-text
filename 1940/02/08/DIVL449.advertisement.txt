VALENTINES
AT CONGDON AND CROME
For those who love —
Sweethearts, wives, husbands, family members; or
for good friends: a range of Valentine sentiments
starting with the most mild and ending with the
most ardent.
For those who laugh—
The saucy missives abound at Congdon £r Crome's.
Hundreds of the good old reliable—the comic val
entine —in new, clever ideas and arrangements.
Yet each provides fun in the best of taste.
THE VALENTINE
that says it best!
