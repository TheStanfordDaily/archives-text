### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
r | I WO "martyred" Irish terrorists
died in Birmingham's Winton
Green Prison yesterday.
And England settled down to pre
pare for a new crisis in Anglo-Irish
relations. This hurried preparation
coincided with what the English
thiak is a German effort to promote
an uprising of the outlawed Irish
Republican Army.

In Dublin, demonstrating crowds
were promised that "the cause of
Ireland will have revenge for
those murders." With Ireland
stirred to wrath, the Republican
army appeared to have gained a
popular issue with which to push
its campaign for forcible union of
independent Eire and Northern, or
Ulster, Ireland. Ulster is currently
a part of the United Kingdom.
The British think that the I.R.A.
is receiving direct aid from Germany
by way of the United States. This
aid is purely financial, but they feel
that the execution of these two men
will induce the Nazis to increase
their attempts to promote Irish-
British difficulties.

r JpHE affair has even further de
tails. If Irish - Americans be
come incensed at the harsh British
steps to grind out terrorism, they,
too, may attack the English gov
ernment in this country. Any ad
verse publicity in America isn't go
ing to help England's international
standing. And this, though it's a
small issue right now, is giving the
Elder Statesmen a small brain
twister.
Eamon De Valera, who was born
in New York, is stuck right now
with a dangerous situation—one of
the most difficult of his turbulent
career as Irish prime minister. By
ironic circumstances He Valera,
who was one of the leaders of the
1!)I6 Easter Rebellion and a prob
lem child for Britain during the
World War I, now represents
Britain's best hope of avoiding
serious trouble with the Irish.
He still maintains, of course, an
uncompromising demand for an end
of the Eire-Ulster partition. At the
same time, though, he has been
firmly opposed to the I.R.A.'s ex
tremist demand that Eire take ad
vantage of Britain's preoccupation
with the war to seize the six north
ern counties by force.

r J| IE two men—Barnes and Rich
ards—wore hanged for planting
a bomb in a bicycle basket on the
main street of Coventry last Aug,
25. It went off, killed five persons,
wounded 50 more. And that, you
may recall, was the worst of a long
series of outrages attributed to the
I.R.A. and extending over a period
of time from January, 1939, to the
present.
There were no new outrages
yesterday, but the internal war
time tension in England was no
ticeably heightened. Around ev
ery public building you could see
grim lines of guards. Special
watches were placed over tlie
homes of judges who presided at
the trials of any I.K.A. men. Lon
don was almost in a state of seige
by the ollicers. Ten thousand ace
Scotland Yard detectives supple
mented the ordinary uniformed
and plain clothes policemen.
In Dublin about 1,000 members of
the Unemployed Workers Rights
Association carrying black flags
marked with skulls and cross bones
demonstrated in protest as soon as
word of the executions reached
Dublin. They wandered around the
city somewhat aimlessly, demanding
an audience with De Valera, only 1o
be told, curtly, that he was "in
conference."
