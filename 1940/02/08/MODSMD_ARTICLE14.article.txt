# Farm Valjean Roams Quad Underground
## 
### BUD AMES 
From the bowels of the earth came
the clanking of metal. Clouds of
steam billowed upward. Then the
manhole opened and out crawled
Stanford's Jean Valjean, the man
who moves in darkness in the
Farm's underground tunnels.
His name is Dick Worry and he
is master of his tiny hollow world,
his approximate two miles of steam
tunnels which burrow under the
Quad. Like Jean Valjean he dis
appears underground and like Jean
Valjean he has one daughter.
COMMUTES ON BICYCLE
Here the analogy ends, for Dick
rides to his work on a bicycle. Each
morning he enters bus tunnels at 7
o'clock to turn on the Farm's steam
pipes instead of running through the
sewers of Paris a la Victor Hugo.
With no other weapon than a flash
light he begins his long, heated
walk. Where does he go?
He plods in his thick-soled boots
through two miles of hot tunnels.
These tunnels run completely around
the Quad and have branches ex
tending to Sequoia, to Encina Com
mons, and a short one to the Mining
Engineering Building. Through
these brick tunnels, which range in
height from five to eight feet, run
the smaller steam pipes which sup
ply I lie campus with heat.
SECURED JOB IN IJM7
As Dick moves he opens key
valves allowing steam to flow. At 3
o'clock in the afternoon he begins
his tour again, this time shutting off
the steam.
"Dick got the Job 'way back in
1917, but he's been around Palo Alto
for about 50 years," one of his
friends in the power house stated.
"He got the job because he was so
short and could go through tunnels
where a man of medium height
couldn't move. He's only 5 feet 1
inches high."
Dick is short, and his shoulders
have become a little rounded and
stooped from frequent bending in
the low tunnels. His face is half
friendly, half serious, never seeming
to change in expression. He moves
about in the upper sunlight blinking
at people over his thick spectacles
and looking as though he bears the
weight of the world.
"It's damn hot down in those tun
nels," the friend continued. "But
Dick doesn't seem to mind. He's
happiest when he's running around
down there turning on that steam.
It's funny, but the heat doesn't ever
seem to affect his weight. If any
thing he's growing downhill from
all that stooping."
Rats —there are none in the tun
nels to bother our Jean Valjean. Of
course ground squirrels fall in every
once in a while. Dick just waits
till they d»e, then he tosses them
out.

short and could go through tunnels

couldn't move. He's only 5 feet 1

Dick is short, and his shoulders
have become a little rounded and
stooped from frequent bending in
the low tunnels. His face is half
friendly, half serious, never seeming
to change in expression. He moves
about in the upper sunlight blinking
at people over his thick spectacles
and looking as though he bears the
weight of the world.
"It's damn hot down in those tun
nels," the friend continued. "But
Dick doesn't seem to mind. He's
happiest when he's running around
down there turning on that steam.
It's funny, but the heat doesn't ever
seem to affect his weight. If any
thing he's growing downhill from
all that stooping."

Stanford's Jean Valjean, the man
who moves in darkness in the
Farm's underground tunnels.
His name is Dick Worry and he
is master of his tiny hollow world,
his approximate two miles of steam
tunnels which burrow under the
Quad. Like Jean Valjean he dis
appears underground and like Jean
Valjean he has one daughter.

Here the analogy ends, for Dick
rides to his work on a bicycle. Each
morning he enters bus tunnels at 7
o'clock to turn on the Farm's steam
pipes instead of running through the
sewers of Paris a la Victor Hugo.
With no other weapon than a flash
light he begins his long, heated
walk. Where does he go?
He plods in his thick-soled boots
through two miles of hot tunnels.
These tunnels run completely around
the Quad and have branches ex
tending to Sequoia, to Encina Com
mons, and a short one to the Mining
Engineering Building. Through
these brick tunnels, which range in
height from five to eight feet, run
the smaller steam pipes which sup
ply I lie campus with heat.
