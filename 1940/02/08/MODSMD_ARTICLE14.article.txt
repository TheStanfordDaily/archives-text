# Farm Valjean Roams Quad Underground
## 
### BUD AMES 
From the bowels of the earth came
the clanking of metal. Clouds of
steam billowed upward. Then the
manhole opened and out crawled
Stanford's Jean Valjean, the man
who moves in darkness in the
Farm's underground tunnels.
His name is Dick Worry and he
is master of his tiny hollow world,
his approximate two miles of steam
tunnels which burrow under the
Quad. Like Jean Valjean he dis
appears underground and like Jean
Valjean he has one daughter.
COMMUTES ON BICYCLE
Here the analogy ends, for Dick
rides to his work on a bicycle. Each
morning he enters bus tunnels at 7
o'clock to turn on the Farm's steam
pipes instead of running through the
sewers of Paris a la Victor Hugo.
With no other weapon than a flash
light he begins his long, heated
walk. Where does he go?
He plods in his thick-soled boots
through two miles of hot tunnels.
These tunnels run completely around
the Quad and have branches ex
tending to Sequoia, to Encina Com
mons, and a short one to the Mining
Engineering Building. Through
these brick tunnels, which range in
height from five to eight feet, run
the smaller steam pipes which sup
ply I lie campus with heat.
SECURED JOB IN IJM7
As Dick moves he opens key
valves allowing steam to flow. At 3
o'clock in the afternoon he begins
his tour again, this time shutting off
the steam.
