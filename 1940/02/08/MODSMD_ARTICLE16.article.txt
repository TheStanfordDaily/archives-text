# Two Solutions Unravel Future Of Scholarships
## Increased Subsidies, Granting of Profits From Co-op Offered 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
The maze of red tape clouding the
fate of future scholarships to Stan
ford athletes and non-athletic needy
students was partially unraveled
yesterday with the revelation of two
possible solutions:
1. Increased alumni subsidiza
tion of needy applicants, with the
provision that such applicants
would not be required to go out
for athletics, or be judged suc
cessful athletes by their sponsors,
*as stipulated in the recent Coast
Conference ruling.
2. Evidence of student favor
toward the granting of the co
operative Bookstore profits to the
Student Aid Commission next
year, in preference to this year's
rebate system.
Immediate alleviation of the
problem arising out of the cancella
tion of Be .d of Athletic Control
contributions to Student Aid funds,
amounting to $5,000 this year, may
be found in any of the following al
ternatives as outlined by Professor
D. E. Faville, president of the
Bookstore board:
1. Students patronizing the
Bookstore may assign rebate slips
to the Student Aid Commission
directly, or to some representative
person.
2. Patrons may forego their re
ceipts in the hope the Bookstore
would give these profits to the
Commission. There is no guaran
tee the Bookstore would take
such action, although Professor
Faville, personally, appeared to
favor the possibility.
!{. A box under the name of the
Commission may be placed in the
Bookstore, in which students may
deposit receipts, unsigned.
4. Patrons could request the
Bookstore management to assign
their rebates to the Commission at
the end of the school year in June,
at the time rebates are declared.
5. Patrons could deposit rebate
checks in a Commission box lo
cated in the Bookstore, when re
bates are distributed in June.
The B.A.C. is prohibited from
contributing to Student. Aid by the
Atherton ruling that no athletes may
rcceive scholarships from funds to
which money is contributed by ath
letic sources.
NO AID THIS YEAR
Professor Faville pointed out that
since the bulk of the sales for 1930-
40 have already taken place, most of
the above alternatives would not.
yield a very great, amount of money
for Student Aid if carried out this
year.
Furlher, lie stated that the rebate
system for this year cannot be
changed now to a system of grant

other recipient because the Book
store has attracted patronage this
