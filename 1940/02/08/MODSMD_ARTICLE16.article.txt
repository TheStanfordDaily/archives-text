# Two Solutions Unravel Future Of Scholarships
## Increased Subsidies, Granting of Profits From Co-op Offered 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
The maze of red tape clouding the
fate of future scholarships to Stan
ford athletes and non-athletic needy
students was partially unraveled
yesterday with the revelation of two
possible solutions:
1. Increased alumni subsidiza
tion of needy applicants, with the
provision that such applicants
would not be required to go out
for athletics, or be judged suc
cessful athletes by their sponsors,
*as stipulated in the recent Coast
Conference ruling.
2. Evidence of student favor
toward the granting of the co
operative Bookstore profits to the
Student Aid Commission next
year, in preference to this year's
rebate system.
Immediate alleviation of the
problem arising out of the cancella
tion of Be .d of Athletic Control
contributions to Student Aid funds,
amounting to $5,000 this year, may
be found in any of the following al
ternatives as outlined by Professor
D. E. Faville, president of the
Bookstore board:
1. Students patronizing the
Bookstore may assign rebate slips
to the Student Aid Commission
directly, or to some representative
person.
2. Patrons may forego their re
ceipts in the hope the Bookstore
would give these profits to the
Commission. There is no guaran
tee the Bookstore would take
such action, although Professor
Faville, personally, appeared to
favor the possibility.
!{. A box under the name of the
Commission may be placed in the
Bookstore, in which students may
deposit receipts, unsigned.
4. Patrons could request the
Bookstore management to assign
their rebates to the Commission at
the end of the school year in June,
at the time rebates are declared.
5. Patrons could deposit rebate
checks in a Commission box lo
cated in the Bookstore, when re
bates are distributed in June.
The B.A.C. is prohibited from
contributing to Student. Aid by the
Atherton ruling that no athletes may
rcceive scholarships from funds to
which money is contributed by ath
letic sources.
NO AID THIS YEAR
Professor Faville pointed out that
since the bulk of the sales for 1930-
40 have already taken place, most of
the above alternatives would not.
yield a very great, amount of money
for Student Aid if carried out this
year.
Furlher, lie stated that the rebate
system for this year cannot be
changed now to a system of grant
ing profits to Student Aid or any
other recipient because the Book
store has attracted patronage this
year on the basis of the rebate sys
tem. This rebates will be
computed upon the basis of an esti
mated 5 per cent of goods purchased.
STUDENT OPINION SOUGHT
Professor Faville stated that
about 40 per cent of the students
pay no attention to rebates, and
that "if everybody claimed their
rebates we wouldn't be able to give
5 per cent."
"We've got to know whether the
student body wants a change before
we can make one. We vote next
September on the method of dis
pensing the co-operative's profits lot
next year," he added. "We're will
ing to do anything the students
want to do in connection with the
profits.
VOTE IS NECESSARY
"The real way to solve the prob
lem is to have a vote," he con
tinued. He also recommended that
student representatives appear be
fore the Booktsore board to discuss
the situation.
"If the students voted the funds
be directed to Student. Aid," he
said, "as an organization that doesn't
give rebates, we would have to face
the problem of attracting trade in
the face of competition, and we must
keep our patronage to retain
profits."
Professor Faville pointed out that
since the Bookstore is organized
under co-operative laws, it is nec
essary to pay income tax when
profits are not distributed. This tax,
he stated, prohibits the giving of
grants to such organizations as
Student Aid, since, to be considered
by the government as operating a
co-operative enterprise, it must de
clare rebates.
TAX SUGGESTED
The possibility of voting a rebate
system again next, year to avoid the
tax. and of setting up a box at the
same time in the Bookstore for Stu
dent Aid was suggested. The degree
to which students co-operated with
this plan would determine its suc
cess, he added.
"At the present time, the only way
we can give the benefit of the non
profit organization to the students is
by means of a rebate. Bookstore
prices can't be cut. because of the
Fair Trade Act."
STATISTICS ANNOUNCED
The last rebate, declared about
five years ago, was on the basis of
3 per cent.
Contradicting the report in yes
terday's Daily, he said that last
year's Bookstore profits totaled ap
proximately $10,000, of which in
come taxes consumed $1,200. Fol
lowing payments for repairs, wages,
and other costs, $7,500 was distrib
uted equally between the Student
Aid Commission, the University
Loan Fund, and the Scholarship
Commission.

NO AID THIS YEAR
Professor Faville pointed out that
since the bulk of the sales for 1930-
40 have already taken place, most of
the above alternatives would not.
yield a very great, amount of money
for Student Aid if carried out this
year.
Furlher, lie stated that the rebate
system for this year cannot be
changed now to a system of grant
ing profits to Student Aid or any
other recipient because the Book
store has attracted patronage this
year on the basis of the rebate sys
tem. This rebates will be
computed upon the basis of an esti
mated 5 per cent of goods purchased.
STUDENT OPINION SOUGHT
Professor Faville stated that
about 40 per cent of the students
pay no attention to rebates, and
that "if everybody claimed their
rebates we wouldn't be able to give
5 per cent."
"We've got to know whether the
student body wants a change before
we can make one. We vote next
September on the method of dis
pensing the co-operative's profits lot
next year," he added. "We're will
ing to do anything the students
want to do in connection with the
profits.
VOTE IS NECESSARY
"The real way to solve the prob
lem is to have a vote," he con
tinued. He also recommended that
student representatives appear be
fore the Booktsore board to discuss
the situation.
"If the students voted the funds
be directed to Student. Aid," he
said, "as an organization that doesn't
give rebates, we would have to face
the problem of attracting trade in
the face of competition, and we must
keep our patronage to retain
profits."
Professor Faville pointed out that
since the Bookstore is organized
under co-operative laws, it is nec
essary to pay income tax when
profits are not distributed. This tax,
he stated, prohibits the giving of
grants to such organizations as
Student Aid, since, to be considered
by the government as operating a
co-operative enterprise, it must de
clare rebates.
TAX SUGGESTED
The possibility of voting a rebate
system again next, year to avoid the
tax. and of setting up a box at the
same time in the Bookstore for Stu
dent Aid was suggested. The degree
to which students co-operated with
this plan would determine its suc
cess, he added.
"At the present time, the only way
we can give the benefit of the non
profit organization to the students is
by means of a rebate. Bookstore
prices can't be cut. because of the
Fair Trade Act."
STATISTICS ANNOUNCED
The last rebate, declared about
five years ago, was on the basis of
3 per cent.
Contradicting the report in yes
terday's Daily, he said that last
year's Bookstore profits totaled ap
proximately $10,000, of which in
come taxes consumed $1,200. Fol
lowing payments for repairs, wages,
and other costs, $7,500 was distrib
uted equally between the Student
Aid Commission, the University
Loan Fund, and the Scholarship
Commission.
The maze of red tape clouding the
fate of future scholarships to Stan
ford athletes and non-athletic needy
students was partially unraveled
yesterday with the revelation of two
possible solutions:
1. Increased alumni subsidiza
tion of needy applicants, with the
provision that such applicants
would not be required to go out
for athletics, or be judged suc
cessful athletes by their sponsors,
*as stipulated in the recent Coast
Conference ruling.
2. Evidence of student favor
toward the granting of the co
operative Bookstore profits to the
Student Aid Commission next
year, in preference to this year's
rebate system.
Immediate alleviation of the
problem arising out of the cancella
tion of Be .d of Athletic Control
contributions to Student Aid funds,
amounting to $5,000 this year, may
be found in any of the following al
ternatives as outlined by Professor
D. E. Faville, president of the
Bookstore board:
1. Students patronizing the
Bookstore may assign rebate slips
to the Student Aid Commission
directly, or to some representative
person.
2. Patrons may forego their re

would give these profits to the

mated 5 per cent of goods purchased.
STUDENT OPINION SOUGHT
Professor Faville stated that
about 40 per cent of the students
pay no attention to rebates, and
that "if everybody claimed their
rebates we wouldn't be able to give
5 per cent."
"We've got to know whether the
student body wants a change before
we can make one. We vote next
September on the method of dis
pensing the co-operative's profits lot
next year," he added. "We're will
ing to do anything the students
want to do in connection with the
profits.
VOTE IS NECESSARY
"The real way to solve the prob
lem is to have a vote," he con
tinued. He also recommended that
student representatives appear be
fore the Booktsore board to discuss
the situation.
"If the students voted the funds
be directed to Student. Aid," he
said, "as an organization that doesn't
give rebates, we would have to face
the problem of attracting trade in
the face of competition, and we must
keep our patronage to retain
profits."
Professor Faville pointed out that
since the Bookstore is organized
under co-operative laws, it is nec
essary to pay income tax when
profits are not distributed. This tax,
he stated, prohibits the giving of
grants to such organizations as
Student Aid, since, to be considered
by the government as operating a
co-operative enterprise, it must de
clare rebates.
TAX SUGGESTED
The possibility of voting a rebate
system again next, year to avoid the
tax. and of setting up a box at the
same time in the Bookstore for Stu
dent Aid was suggested. The degree
to which students co-operated with
this plan would determine its suc
cess, he added.
"At the present time, the only way
we can give the benefit of the non
profit organization to the students is
by means of a rebate. Bookstore
prices can't be cut. because of the
Fair Trade Act."
STATISTICS ANNOUNCED
The last rebate, declared about
five years ago, was on the basis of
3 per cent.
Contradicting the report in yes
terday's Daily, he said that last
year's Bookstore profits totaled ap
proximately $10,000, of which in
come taxes consumed $1,200. Fol
lowing payments for repairs, wages,
and other costs, $7,500 was distrib
uted equally between the Student
Aid Commission, the University
Loan Fund, and the Scholarship
Commission.
The maze of red tape clouding the
fate of future scholarships to Stan
ford athletes and non-athletic needy
students was partially unraveled
yesterday with the revelation of two
possible solutions:
1. Increased alumni subsidiza
tion of needy applicants, with the
provision that such applicants
would not be required to go out
for athletics, or be judged suc
cessful athletes by their sponsors,
*as stipulated in the recent Coast
Conference ruling.
2. Evidence of student favor
toward the granting of the co
operative Bookstore profits to the
Student Aid Commission next
year, in preference to this year's
rebate system.
Immediate alleviation of the
problem arising out of the cancella
tion of Be .d of Athletic Control
contributions to Student Aid funds,
amounting to $5,000 this year, may
be found in any of the following al
ternatives as outlined by Professor
D. E. Faville, president of the
Bookstore board:
1. Students patronizing the
Bookstore may assign rebate slips
to the Student Aid Commission
directly, or to some representative
person.
2. Patrons may forego their re
ceipts in the hope the Bookstore
would give these profits to the
Commission. There is no guaran
tee the Bookstore would take
such action, although Professor
Faville, personally, appeared to
favor the possibility.
!{. A box under the name of the
Commission may be placed in the
Bookstore, in which students may
deposit receipts, unsigned.
4. Patrons could request the
Bookstore management to assign
their rebates to the Commission at
the end of the school year in June,
at the time rebates are declared.
5. Patrons could deposit rebate
checks in a Commission box lo
cated in the Bookstore, when re
bates are distributed in June.
The B.A.C. is prohibited from
contributing to Student. Aid by the
Atherton ruling that no athletes may
rcceive scholarships from funds to
which money is contributed by ath
letic sources.
NO AID THIS YEAR
Professor Faville pointed out that
since the bulk of the sales for 1930-
40 have already taken place, most of
the above alternatives would not.

for Student Aid if carried out this
year.
Furlher, lie stated that the rebate
system for this year cannot be
changed now to a system of grant
ing profits to Student Aid or any
other recipient because the Book
store has attracted patronage this
year on the basis of the rebate sys
