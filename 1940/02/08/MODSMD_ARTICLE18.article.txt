mittee 'I lie*day night when it refused to sanction a proposed campus bene

to sample student opinion on whether

should be held. Keti Cuthbertson,
A.S.S.U. president, has called a spe
cial meeting of the student officers

posal.
STATEMENT OF THE PRESIDENT
President Wilbur's statement fol
lows:
"There seems to be some confu
sion in thinking on the Finnish re
lief problem. This is not. surprising,
with the propaganda of all sorts that
is flying about.
"Feeding the starving and clothing
the naked have nothing to do with
neutrality. The action of a private
citizen, an organization, or a news
paper in giving or collecting funds
for civilian relief in another country
is accepted as decent, desirable and
correct.
"The purchase of arms or the mak
ing of loans or gifts by governments
are in a different category, and even
there we can look at some of the facts
with some clarification. We are
sending hundreds of millions of
dollars' worth of oil and steel to
Japan for war purposes, we are pro
viding a quarter of a billion, dollars'
worth of goods and war supplies to
France and England, belligerents in
a declared war, and we have loaned
considerable sums to China for
food.
STANFORD HAS A PART
"There is not the slightest reason
why the Stanford students should
tie their own hands and fail to help
those who need it, no matter where
they may be. it is important for us
all to learn that we belong to the
whole human family and that what
ever happens to others happens to
us. This talk of helping our own
first is most heavily emphasized by
tho.su who take no part in it.
"It is right, for the Associated
Students to decide that as an or
ganization it will or will not ap
propriate funds for special causes or
give official entertainments for the
raising of funds; but. it. is a mistake
for it to view its actions as if taken
by members of the United States
Senate with direct governmental re
sponsibilities.
"We must retain our right to help
those who suffer, wherever they are,
and not let. the presence of a war
prevent us from helping children and
civilians who are damaged by it.
Neutrality does not mean heartless
ness; nor docs kindness to children
lead to war."

STATEMENT OF THE PRESIDENT
President Wilbur's statement fol
lows:
"There seems to be some confu
sion in thinking on the Finnish re
lief problem. This is not. surprising,
with the propaganda of all sorts that
is flying about.
"Feeding the starving and clothing
the naked have nothing to do with
neutrality. The action of a private
citizen, an organization, or a news
paper in giving or collecting funds
for civilian relief in another country
is accepted as decent, desirable and
correct.
"The purchase of arms or the mak
ing of loans or gifts by governments
are in a different category, and even
there we can look at some of the facts
with some clarification. We are
sending hundreds of millions of
dollars' worth of oil and steel to
Japan for war purposes, we are pro
viding a quarter of a billion, dollars'
worth of goods and war supplies to
France and England, belligerents in
a declared war, and we have loaned
considerable sums to China for
food.
STANFORD HAS A PART
"There is not the slightest reason
why the Stanford students should
tie their own hands and fail to help
those who need it, no matter where
they may be. it is important for us
all to learn that we belong to the
whole human family and that what
ever happens to others happens to
us. This talk of helping our own
first is most heavily emphasized by
tho.su who take no part in it.
"It is right, for the Associated
Students to decide that as an or
ganization it will or will not ap
propriate funds for special causes or
give official entertainments for the
raising of funds; but. it. is a mistake
for it to view its actions as if taken
by members of the United States
Senate with direct governmental re
sponsibilities.
"We must retain our right to help
those who suffer, wherever they are,
and not let. the presence of a war
prevent us from helping children and
civilians who are damaged by it.
Neutrality does not mean heartless
ness; nor docs kindness to children
lead to war."
