CHARTER CHANGED
Approving the minutes of Publica
tions Council, Ex Committee upheld
a change in charter enacted by the
Council at its malting Monday.
The change modifies the provision
thai, the managing editor of The
Daily shall be ineligible for the posi
tion of editor, making the paragraph
read as follows:
"The managing editor shall be
eligible to compete in the election
for editor only with the express'con
sent of Publications Council. This
shall not be construed as altering
the provisions of section 3, para
graph E, part 3, of article 4, Pub
lications Council charter.
"In the event of the position of
editor being vacated during the
course of a volume the managing
editor shall become editor for the
remainder of the volume."
PETITION NECESSARY
The clause mentioned above as
not being changed provides the
method whereby a third candidate
besides the two associate editors can
be nominated. It reads in part as
follows:
"A petition bearing the signature
of a majority of staff members qual
ified to vote shall place in nomina
tion a staff member, provided such
petition be filed with the chairman
of the A.S.S.U. election board, three
days before the date of election."
