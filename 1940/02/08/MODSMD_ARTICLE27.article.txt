ONE of the most doubtful of
news stories released recent
ly in England asserts that
Fuehrer Hitler has already
chosen a ruler or "Gauleiter"
for Great Britain, when the
Nazis win the war. The Gaul
eiter is supposed to be Ernst
Wilhelm Bohle, contact for
foreign Germans.


TALL TALES were related by the crew of the United States freighter, City of Flint, when it
docked in Baltimore after 116 days at sea. The crew displays a Nazi flag that once flew on
the ship. The freighter was captured by a German warship, taken to an eastern Russian port,
and eventually released.


TOSSING HIS HAT into the proverbial election "ring," Wal
ter lohnson, former "Big Train" of the Washington Senators
and now a dabbler in politics, announces that he will run
for Congress in the Republican column in the Germantown,
Maryland, district.


RIGHT, the forest of derricks that marks every oil field may
be radically affected by the revolutionary new portable
telescopic derricks, such as this one developed by the Shell
Oil Company for* use in Texas and California. Costing
516,000, including truck, this portable derrick differs from
the others in that it stretches 84 feet high, can economically
service wells deeper than the 2,500-foot limit of those now
in use.

WARRING EUROPEAN NATIONS would no doubt be overjoyed to make use of this "Airacobra," photographed during
tests at Boiling Field, Washington, D.C. But United States army officials will not permit sale to foreign powers of its newest
weapons. Virtually a mechanized bullet, the plane carries a one-pound cannon in its nose plus four machine guns. Its
speed is 400 miles per hour and it can cruise 1,000 miles at 36,000 feet.
