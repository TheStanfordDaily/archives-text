# Cards Face Revived Cal Five Tomorrow Night
## Berkeley Clash Declared Toss-up Despite Farm's Win in First Game; Anderson's Return Still Uncertain 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
News item: Stanford meets Cal tomorrow night at Berkeley.
look at past performances of Stanford's and California's basket
hall teams—both pretty good since the first ol the year. Then you elimi
nate their records because you can't tell a thing about basketball from
one game ti» the next especially between such rivals as the Cards and Bears.

Then you look at Cal's and Stan-*
ford's respective teams. Cal has tre- I
mendous height and some new tal- j
ent, while Stanford looks the part |
ol one of the smoothest-functioning
quintets on the Coast. But you have 1
to discard that because you don't
know what game-time may produce.
ODDS ARE EVEN
Then you look at the odds. As
far as anyone can make it out it's !
a toss-up, with the possibility that |
it'll be the ding-dongest Cal-Stan
lord basketball battle since Hank
Luisetti and Company had to fight
off the Bears in 19138.
It's so close that neither Coach j
Everett Dean of Stanford nor Coach j
Nibs Price of the Bears wants his |
club to be favored over the other.
So they're both willing to let it ride j
as a toss-up, hoping to instill some!
more spirit into the playing of their
respective players.
PRACTICES ARE LIGHT
For the second straight week the j
Indians have taken things easy, hav
ing had Monday off and light work
outs Tuesday and yesterday. This |
afternoon they £ct another leave of
absence from the basketball court, j
The Bears on the other hand are
working fast to get into shape against
Stanford. Their second String de
feated U.S.F. Tuesday night to give
those men a little experience for
tomorrow's game.
BRUINS FINALLY WIN
While the Card-Bear clash will j
have their immediate attention, both
Dean and Price will be eyeing the
outcome of the U.C.L.A, and U.S.C.
game down in Los Angeles on the
side. The Bruins finally have won
a ball game after 30 unsuccessful at
tempts in over two years of South
ern Division play.
Stanford's stock to defeat the
Bears will be greatly increased if
Fordy Anderson, who has been out
of the Trojan series and the double
header last week with Santa Clara
and St. Mary's, is able to get in
the starting line-up. Whether An- (
derson starts will not be known
until game time.

side. The Bruins finally have won
a ball game after 30 unsuccessful at
tempts in over two years of South
ern Division play.
Stanford's stock to defeat the
Bears will be greatly increased if
Fordy Anderson, who has been out
of the Trojan series and the double
header last week with Santa Clara
and St. Mary's, is able to get in
the starting line-up. Whether An- (
derson starts will not be known
until game time.
News item: Stanford meets Cal tomorrow night at Berkeley.
look at past performances of Stanford's and California's basket
hall teams—both pretty good since the first ol the year. Then you elimi
nate their records because you can't tell a thing about basketball from
one game ti» the next especially between such rivals as the Cards and Bears.

Then you look at Cal's and Stan-*
ford's respective teams. Cal has tre- I
mendous height and some new tal- j
ent, while Stanford looks the part |
ol one of the smoothest-functioning
quintets on the Coast. But you have 1
to discard that because you don't
know what game-time may produce.
ODDS ARE EVEN
Then you look at the odds. As
far as anyone can make it out it's !
a toss-up, with the possibility that |
it'll be the ding-dongest Cal-Stan
lord basketball battle since Hank
Luisetti and Company had to fight
off the Bears in 19138.
It's so close that neither Coach j
Everett Dean of Stanford nor Coach j
Nibs Price of the Bears wants his |
club to be favored over the other.
So they're both willing to let it ride j
as a toss-up, hoping to instill some!
more spirit into the playing of their
respective players.
PRACTICES ARE LIGHT
For the second straight week the j
Indians have taken things easy, hav
ing had Monday off and light work
outs Tuesday and yesterday. This |
afternoon they £ct another leave of
absence from the basketball court, j
The Bears on the other hand are
working fast to get into shape against
Stanford. Their second String de
feated U.S.F. Tuesday night to give
those men a little experience for
tomorrow's game.
BRUINS FINALLY WIN
While the Card-Bear clash will j
have their immediate attention, both
Dean and Price will be eyeing the
outcome of the U.C.L.A, and U.S.C.
game down in Los Angeles on the
side. The Bruins finally have won
a ball game after 30 unsuccessful at
tempts in over two years of South
