In an effort to build up a new
era in freshman track at Stanford,
Coach Jack Weiershauser yesterday
issued a plea for all inmates of En
cina who are interested in the cin
der sport to report for practice im
mediately.
"There are two different types of
prospective frosh track candidates
in Encina," said Weiershauser,
"those who competed in school
but have not turned out here be
cause of reports that the squad is
reserved for stars, and those who
would like to take up track for the
first time but are scared of too
much competition."
Weiershauser went on to point out
lhat with the exception of the high
jump every frosh event is weak,
and the pole vault candidates are
especially inexperienced. As for
those who are afraid to turn out be
cause they have never competed be
fore, Weiershauser had this to say:
"In four years it is surprising what
a person with two legs and some
confidence can do. When Ben East
man entered Stanford he had never
bettered 52 seconds in the 440, yet
when he graduated he held the st ill -
standing world record of 40.4 in the
event.
