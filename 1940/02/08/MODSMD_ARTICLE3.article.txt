not be entertained for dinner as he
makes a policy of never dining out
before a lecture. He will be accom
panied by his wife, the former Lady
Diana Manners, who is remem
bered for the part she took in Max
Reinhardt's production of "The Mir
acle" given here a number of years
ago.
STILL IN PARLIAMENT
Since his dramatic resignation in
October, 1938, Mr. Cooper has re
tained his seat in Parliament and
his leadership in the bloc of "young
er statesmen" headed by Anthony
Eden.
Any drastic reorganization of the
British Cabinet to meet a great na
tional emergency, according to re
ports from London, is almost bound
to see him back in the cabinet, sec
ond in power only to Eden, himself.
Following tonight's lecture, Mr.
Cooper has announced that he will
receive interested students in the
Green Room of the Memorial The
ater to speak to them and to answer
their questions.
