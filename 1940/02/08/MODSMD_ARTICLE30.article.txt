That mention iti Sideline Slants
some time ago about putting Hank
Luisetti's jersey, No. 7, into the
trophy case forever and ever seems
to have passed into oblivion, but
there's nothing like reviving an old
cause, especially when it has such
merits as this one.
Luisetti was for three years with
out an equal in national collegiate
basketball. It is more than barely
possible that there never was an
other like him in any kind of bas
ketball, eollei?e or pro.
lie brought to Stanford Univer
sity as much, if not more, ath
letic fame than any athlete you
can name—am! that includes Big
Ben Eastman, Ernie Nevers, and
the rest of a long line of world
champions who performed for
Stanford.
Nevers, probably the finest full
back Stanford ever had, was
deemed worthy of having his jersey
withdrawn from competition and
placed in the trophy case. Since
1925 there hasn't been a No. 1 on
Stanford's football teams.
Executive Committee ruled
that Nevers' shirt was never to
he used again at a meeting Tues
day, Nov. 24. 1925. Stanford really
loved Blond Ernie that year—lie
brought them the first victory
Stanford had scored over Cali
fornia in 20 years, and that meant
something in the roaring '20'.-..
Now, here is Luisetti, every bit
the champion Nevers was, and no
body wants to make the move that
will give him the same honor. Ex
Committee has the power to fix
things up, so why not indicate to
Hank that all that hand-clapping in
his last games for the old school
was not just a passing show? If
any man ever deserved to have his
jersey taken out of use, it's Lui
setti.
