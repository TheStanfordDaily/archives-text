# Lee Rates Cub Cagers as Best In Six Seasons
## Stanford Papooses Clash with Cal Frosh In Preliminary Battle 
### 
"We'll have to play oui best game
; to beat the Cal Frosh, for they have
the best team that I've seen play
lor them in the six years I've watch
-1 ed them."
That was the way H. B. Lee,
! former member of the Laughing
I Boys and present Stanford fresh
! man basketball coach, rated the
1940 Cal Cubs, and his team's
chances of licking them. And up
Berkeley way they agree with Lee,
boasting that this is the best quintet
to represent the Cal freshmen on
i the basketball court in at least
j seven years.
| So it's evident that the Papoose
I yearlings are due for a tough strug
! gle when they meet their arch-rivals
in the preliminary to the Cal-Stan
| ford varsity game at Berkeley to
! morrow night.
i STAR CAL FORWARDS
In Bill Durkee and Gordy Garet
| son, Bob Herwig, Cal frosh mentor,
| has a pair of speedy, sharp-shooting
' forwards who are especially effec
i tive under and near the bucket,
where their height and aggresive
! ness may be used to the greatest
j advantage.
However, Stanford's "Big Eds,"
| Voss and Stamm, are no slouches
i when it comes to working in the
| melee within the 10-foot circle, and
j they should be able to hold their
i own with Durkee and Garetson, ac
cording to Lee.
CENTER, GUARD SPOTS
Bob Wylie at center, and J'oe Ol
iver and Frank Bush at guards
make up the rest of the smooth
working combination. Oliver, who
has only recently been shifted to
guard from forward, is very highly
touted, and with Garetson is rated
the best prospect for the varsity.
Working on the theory that too
j much work is as bad as too little,
j Coach Beeb Lee called off practice
j for this afternoon after sending his
charges through a stiff workout both
yesterday and the day before.
Following the Cal frosh contest
I Friday night, the Papoose squad

CENTER, GUARD SPOTS
Bob Wylie at center, and J'oe Ol
iver and Frank Bush at guards
make up the rest of the smooth
working combination. Oliver, who
has only recently been shifted to
guard from forward, is very highly
touted, and with Garetson is rated
the best prospect for the varsity.
Working on the theory that too
j much work is as bad as too little,
j Coach Beeb Lee called off practice
j for this afternoon after sending his
charges through a stiff workout both
yesterday and the day before.
Following the Cal frosh contest
I Friday night, the Papoose squad
I does battle with Galileo High School
! on Saturday night in the Pavilion.
"We'll have to play oui best game
; to beat the Cal Frosh, for they have
the best team that I've seen play
lor them in the six years I've watch
-1 ed them."
That was the way H. B. Lee,
! former member of the Laughing
I Boys and present Stanford fresh
! man basketball coach, rated the
1940 Cal Cubs, and his team's
chances of licking them. And up
Berkeley way they agree with Lee,
boasting that this is the best quintet
to represent the Cal freshmen on
i the basketball court in at least
j seven years.
| So it's evident that the Papoose
I yearlings are due for a tough strug
! gle when they meet their arch-rivals
in the preliminary to the Cal-Stan
| ford varsity game at Berkeley to
! morrow night.
i STAR CAL FORWARDS
In Bill Durkee and Gordy Garet
| son, Bob Herwig, Cal frosh mentor,
| has a pair of speedy, sharp-shooting
' forwards who are especially effec
i tive under and near the bucket,
where their height and aggresive
! ness may be used to the greatest
j advantage.
However, Stanford's "Big Eds,"
| Voss and Stamm, are no slouches
i when it comes to working in the
| melee within the 10-foot circle, and
j they should be able to hold their
i own with Durkee and Garetson, ac
cording to Lee.
