## 
### 
In anticipation of a tough game
with the ruggers fi'om U.S.C.,
Coaches Wylie, Maloney, and
Clausen are pouring it on in rugby
practice this week. The U.S.C. game
will be played Saturday in 'the
Stadium.
Pleasing to the coaches is the im
proved work of Pete Kmetovic,
Hugh Gallarneau, and Kay McMur
ray in the Cardinal backfield. How
ever, a long scrimmage held last
Monday indicated that the Big Red
forwards are not working together

| in tip-top fashion.
Another tough scrimmage was j
held last night, and one is planned j
for this afternoon in an effort to get;
the squad in shape for what will j
undoubtedly be a bitterly contested '
battle. Members of Coach Howard 1
Jones' Rose Bowl champion foot
ball team form the nucleus of the j
Trojan rugby squad.
The name Idaho is derived from J
the Indian "Edae hoe," meaning;
'"light, on the mountain.''
