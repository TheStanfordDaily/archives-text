# Reichman Plans Request Prom
## 
### 
Music Stanford wants is what Joe
Reichmann will play Feb. 16 when
he comes to the Farm for the Senior
Prom.
Instead of discouraging requests,
as do many orchestras, Reichmann
asks for them, making up his pro
grams as the evening progresses.
Gaieties tunes have been sent to
him, and he plans to play them at
the prom, as well as his arrange
ment of "Come Join the Band."
Since the Prom is a valentine
dance, heart-shaped souvenir bids
will be sold, bearing the words, "Be
My Valentine at the Senior Prom."
Only the stubs will be taken at the
door, Co-chairman Dick Wright an
nounces.
Priced at $3, the bids go on sale
tomorrow at the A.S.S.U. office.
Tuxes are optional.
Meanwhile, the other co-chiarman,
Jane Le Cutler, announces a change
in deadline for the contest for a
free bid to the Prom. Lists of songs
whose titles contain the word "heart"
must be turned in at the A.S.S.U.
office by next. Wednesday noon, she
said last night.
Other members of the committee
are Powers Cameron, Carl Phillips,
Frank Birbeck, Bob Hadeler, Mollic
