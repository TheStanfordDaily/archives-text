# Alms for Finland—or Men?
## 
### 
FROM many parts of the campus yesterday
came reverberations of Ex Committee's re
fusal to give A.S.S.U. support to the proposed
program for Finnish relief.
President Wilbur attacked the stand on the
ground that all humanitarian work is neutral,
students' letters to the editor decried it as "yel
low," "cowardly," and "anti-British," and the
Finnish Relief Committee planned to ask Ex
Committee's approval of sampling campus sen
timent on the issue.
Despite all the noise that proponents of the
suggested program are making and the com
parative silence of its opponents, the funda
mental issue remains unchanged: Is the giving
of relief to a single nation out of a group of
belligerents an unneutral act and one which
eventually might lead to the United States be
coming involved in the war?
Those who believe in aiding the Finns point
to the United States' exports to Japan, its sales
of airplanes and other commodities to France
and England, and the loans to China and Fin
land that are under consideration. These are
perfectly neutral, they claim, because the gov
ernment has passed no law against them.
As a matter of fact they are not neutral. Ex
perience has taught this country that "cash and
cari-y" is the only workable policy—and nothing
can be done about an admittedly pro-Allies ad
ministration until next November.
Proponents of the view that humanitarian
relief for the Finns is non-partisan point out the
fact that at any time we could give a similar
benefit for the Germans or the Russians. True,
we could do such a thing within the law, but
to think that we might is ridiculous.
Certain critics have disapproved Ex Com
mittee's action on the ground that contributing
to humanitarian relief on one side could not
possibly lead us along the road to war. These
people fail to realize the formidable might of
propaganda and the sweeping power of any
sympathy which can so easily be transformed
into partisanship.
And once the United States becomes defi
nitely partisan, it will take only a spark, in the
form of another Lusitania or a brutal civilian
bombing in which Americans are killed, to light
the fuse of war. Anyone who does not believe
this can see it concretely proved by looking
through the files of any newspaper from 1914
to 1917.
Fortunately, today we are only arguing about
giving civilian relief to a belligerent. But if some
group, even though it be one as insignificant
as the Associated Students of Stanford Univer
sity, does not stand up and point out that such
aid is not neutral, next year we may be ha
ranguing over a far more serious guestion:
Shall Stanford encourage the United States'
sending men to help the Allies win the war?

ranguing over a far more serious guestion:
Shall Stanford encourage the United States'
sending men to help the Allies win the war?
FROM many parts of the campus yesterday
came reverberations of Ex Committee's re
fusal to give A.S.S.U. support to the proposed
program for Finnish relief.
President Wilbur attacked the stand on the
ground that all humanitarian work is neutral,
students' letters to the editor decried it as "yel
low," "cowardly," and "anti-British," and the
Finnish Relief Committee planned to ask Ex
Committee's approval of sampling campus sen
timent on the issue.
Despite all the noise that proponents of the
suggested program are making and the com
parative silence of its opponents, the funda
mental issue remains unchanged: Is the giving
of relief to a single nation out of a group of
belligerents an unneutral act and one which
eventually might lead to the United States be
coming involved in the war?
Those who believe in aiding the Finns point
to the United States' exports to Japan, its sales
of airplanes and other commodities to France
and England, and the loans to China and Fin
land that are under consideration. These are
perfectly neutral, they claim, because the gov
ernment has passed no law against them.
As a matter of fact they are not neutral. Ex
perience has taught this country that "cash and
cari-y" is the only workable policy—and nothing
can be done about an admittedly pro-Allies ad
ministration until next November.
Proponents of the view that humanitarian
relief for the Finns is non-partisan point out the
fact that at any time we could give a similar
benefit for the Germans or the Russians. True,
we could do such a thing within the law, but
to think that we might is ridiculous.
Certain critics have disapproved Ex Com
mittee's action on the ground that contributing
to humanitarian relief on one side could not
possibly lead us along the road to war. These
people fail to realize the formidable might of
propaganda and the sweeping power of any
sympathy which can so easily be transformed
into partisanship.
And once the United States becomes defi
nitely partisan, it will take only a spark, in the
form of another Lusitania or a brutal civilian
bombing in which Americans are killed, to light
the fuse of war. Anyone who does not believe
this can see it concretely proved by looking
through the files of any newspaper from 1914
to 1917.
Fortunately, today we are only arguing about
giving civilian relief to a belligerent. But if some
group, even though it be one as insignificant
as the Associated Students of Stanford Univer
sity, does not stand up and point out that such
aid is not neutral, next year we may be ha
ranguing over a far more serious guestion:
