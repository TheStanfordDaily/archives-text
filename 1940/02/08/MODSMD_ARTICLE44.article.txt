# Save Student Aid
## 
### 
THE announcement of the news that the new
Atherton code and the Bookstore's distribu
tion of profits will drastically reduce the funds
available for Student Aid scholarships spelled
a summary end to a Stanford education as far
as a number of deserving men and women were
concerned.
The Pacific Coast Conference clean-up un
questionably prevents the B.A.C. from turning
over any money to the Student Aid Commission.
That much income must be kissed goodbyeâ€”
unless the alumni take some kind of action to
make it up.
In the case of the Bookstore profits, a great
deal more hope is in evidence. Although the
store must be run on a co-operative basis in
order to gain exemption from taxes which would
eat up all the surplus otherwise, there is nothing
to prevent the customers' turning back their
rebate slips, thus automatically allowing the
money to go to Student Aid.
At present 40 per cent of the purchasers do
not bother with their slips anyway. The highest
rebate that a student possibly can gain is two
dollars per year, and most of the returns are
clser to 50 cents.
Comparing what probably happens to this
half dollar and the good that could be done if
the Bookstore were allowed to turn the money
over to the Student Aid Commission, what
should be done to remedy the coming emer
gency is obvious.
A definite expression of student opinion is
all that is necessary to revert from the system
of paying rebates to collecting the funds for
scholarships.
With the Bookstore remaining on a nominally
co-operative basis, if anyone felt that his four
bits was sufficiently important an exception
could be made in his case.
