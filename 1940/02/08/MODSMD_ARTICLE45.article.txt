### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
THIS ISN'T PROPAGANDA
I COOPER, smooth young British statesman,
is a traveling spokesman for England. Much of
the campus has been up in arms over the "threat to
our neutrality" and the invasion of Stanford by "propa
ganda agents."
In a sense, one cannot criticize the neutrality
minded opponents ol Duir Cooper's speech. Like a
good many of us, they are sincerely thinking of Ameri
can peace. In particular, they are thinking of the flood
of propaganda that inundated America in 1914. They
are thinking of the uselessness of the first World War,
and, perhaps, the vain losses in life that Stanford and
the whole country suffered in 1017 and 1918. One
cannot blame them for being wary of British spokes
men.
But the blanket effort to avoid propaganda can
sometimes make well-meaning ears tone-deaf. The
campus has been more than adequately advised of the
fact that Duff Cooper is a "public-relations" man for
the Allied cause. Some of us even suspected that his
sympathies were with the Briti.sh before TIME told
us about his official affiliations. A former First Lord
of the Admiralty can reasonably be suspected of har
boring a spot of loyalty for His Majesty's cause in
Europe.
* # * *
IT WOULD seem, then, that Stanford has been rather
completely inoculated against any partisan infec
tions that may insidiously attack us from the open
rostrum tonight. Duff Cooper may be a brilliant ora
tor. But I think he will have a fairly difficult job on
his hands if he tries to convince us that he isn't a
little prejudiced on the subject of Britain and her
allies.
Rather than imitate that virtuous little trio of Chi
nese monkeys, then, who cover their eyes, ears, and
mouths to avoid the intake or output of evil, we might
do well to hear what one of Britain's leading states
men has to say. It is a little hard to visualize a Stan
ford audience so intellectually defenseless that it can
not listen to a partisan commentator without a rea
sonably critical attitude.
It would be another story if Duff Cooper were being
heralded by the political science department and the
Board of Trustees as an impartial authority on the
World War. But I understand that he really isn't
going to slip into Memorial Hall masquerading as an
unprejudiced American. It is even logical to assume
that he will have a tell-tale English accent. Per
haps he will even have a spot of tea at 4 o'clock this
afternoon.
Along with those who condemn the Lecture Series
for letting Alfred Duff Cooper speak, I believe in
American neutrality. Along with Lecture Series
critics I want to hear both sides of the question. But
tonight I am going to listen to Duff Cooper. And I
feel buoyantly self-confident that I will not come home
tonight wearing a sergeant's uniform in the British
army.

tions that may insidiously attack us from the open
rostrum tonight. Duff Cooper may be a brilliant ora
tor. But I think he will have a fairly difficult job on
his hands if he tries to convince us that he isn't a
little prejudiced on the subject of Britain and her
allies.
Rather than imitate that virtuous little trio of Chi
nese monkeys, then, who cover their eyes, ears, and
mouths to avoid the intake or output of evil, we might
do well to hear what one of Britain's leading states
men has to say. It is a little hard to visualize a Stan
ford audience so intellectually defenseless that it can
not listen to a partisan commentator without a rea
sonably critical attitude.
It would be another story if Duff Cooper were being
heralded by the political science department and the
Board of Trustees as an impartial authority on the
World War. But I understand that he really isn't
going to slip into Memorial Hall masquerading as an
unprejudiced American. It is even logical to assume
that he will have a tell-tale English accent. Per
haps he will even have a spot of tea at 4 o'clock this
afternoon.
Along with those who condemn the Lecture Series
for letting Alfred Duff Cooper speak, I believe in
American neutrality. Along with Lecture Series
critics I want to hear both sides of the question. But
tonight I am going to listen to Duff Cooper. And I
feel buoyantly self-confident that I will not come home
tonight wearing a sergeant's uniform in the British
army.
THIS ISN'T PROPAGANDA
I COOPER, smooth young British statesman,
is a traveling spokesman for England. Much of
the campus has been up in arms over the "threat to
our neutrality" and the invasion of Stanford by "propa
ganda agents."
In a sense, one cannot criticize the neutrality
minded opponents ol Duir Cooper's speech. Like a
good many of us, they are sincerely thinking of Ameri
can peace. In particular, they are thinking of the flood
of propaganda that inundated America in 1914. They
are thinking of the uselessness of the first World War,
and, perhaps, the vain losses in life that Stanford and
the whole country suffered in 1017 and 1918. One
cannot blame them for being wary of British spokes
men.
But the blanket effort to avoid propaganda can
sometimes make well-meaning ears tone-deaf. The
campus has been more than adequately advised of the
fact that Duff Cooper is a "public-relations" man for
the Allied cause. Some of us even suspected that his
sympathies were with the Briti.sh before TIME told
us about his official affiliations. A former First Lord
of the Admiralty can reasonably be suspected of har
boring a spot of loyalty for His Majesty's cause in
Europe.

IT WOULD seem, then, that Stanford has been rather
completely inoculated against any partisan infec
tions that may insidiously attack us from the open
rostrum tonight. Duff Cooper may be a brilliant ora
tor. But I think he will have a fairly difficult job on
his hands if he tries to convince us that he isn't a
