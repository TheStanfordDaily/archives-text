## ISOLATIONIST EXCOM?

HTHE EDITOR, SIR:
Of all the yellow, cowardly actions that have
ever happened, that taken by our Ex Committee
concerning the Finnish relief fund is the worst.
Can it be that the attitude of all Stanford is typi
fied by such selfish thoughtlessness? The Finns are
just like you—and they're fighting for existence.
Is there still a standard of right and wrong in the
world? If so, the best and most patent definition of
right and wrong occurs in the Russo-Finnish war. It's
unmistakable. And, because of some absurd prattle
about our being drawn into war, our Ex Committee
refuses to help the Finns.
It leaves only one conclusion. Either a few of our
representatives are yellow "peace at any price-ers,"
or they unwittingly let a couple of dumb women lead
them by the nose.
