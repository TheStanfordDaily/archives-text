# BE FAIR TO THE FINNS

npHE EDITOR, SIR:
Certain factions of Stanford's student body have
nobly blocked a campus attempt to raise money for
the Finnish Relief Fund on the grounds that it is un
neutral. A little careful thought makes it quite evi
dent that attempting to help homeless people in a
land devastated by horror and death is merely humani
tarian.
Furthermore, may we ask those scintillating anti-
British who persist in feeling that aiding the Finns is
unneutral, if they are opposed to charity in general,
or only charity which might cause their rosy-hued
friends to think ill of them? Charity may begin at
home, but when it fails to leap t.he walls of our tradi
tional provincialism, the time has come for Stanford
to wake up.
The Finns built an eight million dollar stadium for
the benefit of American and other athletes who
were to participate in the Olympic Games, but it
would be unneutral for Stanford to attempt to repay
a little of this. Stanford's '"cardinal red" has been
mentioned at times in connection with its intellec
tual sympathy as well as its collegiate symbol. In
blocking on our campus this highly thought-of. nation
wide drive, we are giving our accusers ample am
muntion. .
