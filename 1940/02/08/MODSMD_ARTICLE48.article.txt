# HONOR NOT FOR SALE
## 
### 
r pIE EDITOR, SIR:
It was with a great deal of personal interest that
I read your sports editor's column in this morning's
Daily. As a member of the 8.A.C., as a graduate stu
dent in Physical Education, and as a former Stanford
trackman, the implications put forth by the Sports
Editor evidently point to me and the other student
concerned as having "sold our honor" to the Director
of the School of Physical Education in order to in
sure our success scholastically and professionally in
Physical Education.
As a matter of fact I have opposed the Director and
other members of the BA.C. on a number of occa
sions. If your Sports Editor's accusations of coercion
by the Physical Education Department is correct, then
I had better find some field other than Physical Edu
caiton in which to earn a livelihood.
After two years as a member of the board I have
yet. to hear the Director of any member of the board
say "vote this way, or else." If such coercion has ever
been used by the Physical Education Department, it
must have occurred previous to my term on the board.
Sincerely,
Stan Hiserman
