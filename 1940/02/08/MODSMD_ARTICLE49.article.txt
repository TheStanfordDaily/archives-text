# THANK THE NICE MAN

### 
r FIIE EDITOR. SIR:
Sorry to see anybody, especially a Stanford stu
dent, maintain an attitude which causes its victim to
believe a traffic jam in Paly is more important than
an occasional democratic expression of friendliness and
generosity toward a fellow student.
However, "guests who manifest no appreciation
whatsoever" would tend to gripe a guy.
Sincerely,
I Ride
