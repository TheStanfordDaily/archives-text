# Coward Proves Versatile In Short Story Venture
## 
### 
"TO STEP ASIDE" l>,\ Noel Coward I
Now that Noel Coward is firmly |
set in his place as premier writer
of slick drawing-room comedies, he !
has turned to other literary fields, |
whether to prove His worth as some
thing besides a playwright or just
for the hell of it is probably not ;
clear to anyone but the übiquitous
Mr. Coward.
First Coward turned his pen to his
amusing and egotistic autobiography j
"Present Indicative," which topped i
best seller lists for a decent period, j
and now in "To Step Aside" he has
entered the fiction field with this col- j
lection of .short stories.
ATTEMPTS DEEPER THINGS
Characterized both in private and
public life as a super-sophisticate, he j
still, from time to time, takes a turn
at the deeper things of life. This he
did well in "Cavalcade," badly in
"Point Valaine," and with varying |
success in some of the "Tonight at
8:30" cycle. His autobiography was |
completely wnat one might call j
"Coward-plus," but none of the seven
stories in "To Step Aside" is in the |
expected Coward manner.
He seems to be at his best when !
he is dealing with superficialities
which make up the world he lives in,
but deep dealings with superficiali
ties can be sharp enough to make
you squirm.
CAFE SOCIETY TREATED
In "Wooden Madonna" and "Na
ture Study" he goes beneath the sur- |
face of the international crowd, |
pointing out, in the first case, the j
utter stupidity of a slightly dazed |
successful playwright, and in the
second case the tragedy in a Hip,
wealthy marriage.
"What Mad Pursuit" should win
Coward a whole raft of cold shoul
ders from the New York cafe so
ciety crowd, for this malignant dia
tribe succeeds in making the whole
group not only very funny but
crushingly futile, in their wearing,
useless existences.
A poignant recollection of a sor- j
did but withal gallant childhood is

beautifully told in "Aunt Tittie,"
and it makes one wonder just where
he got the story. It seems almost
too real. "Cheap Excursion" is a
portrait of a middle-aged actress
foolishly and hysterically in love
with a young actor who hardly
knows her.
But it is from "Traveller's Joy"
that the book really gains most of
its merit. It is a pathetic tale told
with deep insight into the unhappi
ness of a humble hunch-backed
woman, whose frustrated harmless
dream of love is smashed by an un
witting look of loathing from an
egoistic actor.—Nowell

But it is from "Traveller's Joy"
that the book really gains most of
its merit. It is a pathetic tale told

dream of love is smashed by an un
witting look of loathing from an

"TO STEP ASIDE" l>,\ Noel Coward I
Now that Noel Coward is firmly |
set in his place as premier writer
of slick drawing-room comedies, he !
has turned to other literary fields, |
whether to prove His worth as some
thing besides a playwright or just
for the hell of it is probably not ;
clear to anyone but the übiquitous
Mr. Coward.
First Coward turned his pen to his
amusing and egotistic autobiography j
"Present Indicative," which topped i
best seller lists for a decent period, j
and now in "To Step Aside" he has
entered the fiction field with this col- j
lection of .short stories.
ATTEMPTS DEEPER THINGS
Characterized both in private and
public life as a super-sophisticate, he j
still, from time to time, takes a turn
at the deeper things of life. This he
did well in "Cavalcade," badly in
"Point Valaine," and with varying |
success in some of the "Tonight at
8:30" cycle. His autobiography was |
completely wnat one might call j
"Coward-plus," but none of the seven
stories in "To Step Aside" is in the |
expected Coward manner.
He seems to be at his best when !
he is dealing with superficialities
which make up the world he lives in,
but deep dealings with superficiali
ties can be sharp enough to make
you squirm.
CAFE SOCIETY TREATED
In "Wooden Madonna" and "Na
ture Study" he goes beneath the sur- |
face of the international crowd, |
pointing out, in the first case, the j
utter stupidity of a slightly dazed |
successful playwright, and in the
second case the tragedy in a Hip,
wealthy marriage.
"What Mad Pursuit" should win
Coward a whole raft of cold shoul
ders from the New York cafe so
ciety crowd, for this malignant dia
tribe succeeds in making the whole
group not only very funny but
crushingly futile, in their wearing,
useless existences.
A poignant recollection of a sor- j
did but withal gallant childhood is

beautifully told in "Aunt Tittie,"
and it makes one wonder just where
he got the story. It seems almost
too real. "Cheap Excursion" is a
portrait of a middle-aged actress
foolishly and hysterically in love
with a young actor who hardly
knows her.
