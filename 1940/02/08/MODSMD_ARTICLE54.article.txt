# Luncheon Club Hears Student
## Workers' School Has Value, Says Speaker 
### 
Attending a workers' school is of
great value to a college student be
cause it puts him in contact with
people who are doing things about
which he is reading and studying,
Erma Celventra, Stanford junior,
told Luncheon Club in the Nitery
yesterday noon.
"The experience I had at the Pa
cific Workers' School in Berkeley
last summer could not have taken
the place of my courses in college,
but it certainly amplified and added
to them," she said.
Outside the artificial atmosphere
of a university a student can learn
what people who must earn their
living are really thinking and doing,
she pointed out.
Courses in labor and economic
subjects are held in the morning,
round table discussions on subjects
of national interest in the afternoon,
and lectures on foreign peoples and
their problems in the evening.
Every walk of life, every union
ism, and every political belief—even
Communism—was represented at the
school, she added.
