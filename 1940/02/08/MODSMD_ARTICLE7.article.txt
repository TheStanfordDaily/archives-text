# Senate Ponders Aid to Finland
## House Stops Bills Aimed at Russia 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 7 (UP).—
The Senate Foreign Relations Com
mittee cleared the decks for finan
cial aid to war-invaded Finland and
China today while the House de
feated two proposals aimed at break
ing off diplomatic relations with
Russia.
The committee approved, 12 to 6,
a bill increasing the Export-Import
Bank's capital by $100,000,000, of
which $20,000,000 could be loaned on
a non-military basis to China and
$20,000,000 to Finland although
names of both nations are omitted.
The proposed Chinese loan came
as a surprise and was interpreted in
some quarters as a new blow at
Japan in protest against her treat
ment of Americans in China.
WANT CHINESE LOAN
China is now repaying a $25,000,000
loan made last year. The one tenta
tively approved today was sponsored
by Committee Chairman Key Pitt
man who said "There is the greatest
desire on the part of the Adminis
tration to make the loan."
The House action came on two
amendments to the Stale Department
appropriation bill. They were spon
sored by Representative John Mc-
Cormack, D., Mass., and would have
eliminated funds for keeping open
the American embassy in Moscow
and for paying the $ 17,500 salary of
Ambassador Laurence Steinhardt.
The first was rejected 95 to 38 and
the second 108 to 105, after heated
debate in which many Congressmen
heaped calumny on Russia for her
invasion of Finland.
LOAN EXPANSION
The Senate is expected to take up
the loan bill tomorrow. Under its
provisions the Export-Import Batik,
at its discretion, can loan up to $20,-
000,000 of new money to "any coun
try." As drawn by the Senate
Banking and Currency Committee it
originally provided no more than
$5,000,000 could bo loaned to China,
the amount the Far Eastern nation
has repaid on its previous loan.
Pittman put through an amend
ment changing the language so China
can borrow up to $20,000,000. At the
same time Federal Loan Adminis
trator Jesse Jones confirmed a re
cent United Press dispatch saying
negotiations were under way with
Chinese officials for a new loan and
China was asking for $75,000,000.
Finland already has borrowed
$10,000,000.
Senator Prentiss Brown, D., Mich.,
said tomorrow he will introduce a
bill to authorize the Reconstruction
Finance Corporation to loan back
to Finland, without any restrictions,
$5,890,000, the amount the republic
has paid in principal and interest on
its post-war debt of $8,233,577.

cial aid to war-invaded Finland and
China today while the House de
feated two proposals aimed at break
ing off diplomatic relations with
Russia.
The committee approved, 12 to 6,
a bill increasing the Export-Import
Bank's capital by $100,000,000, of
which $20,000,000 could be loaned on
a non-military basis to China and
$20,000,000 to Finland although
names of both nations are omitted.
The proposed Chinese loan came
as a surprise and was interpreted in
some quarters as a new blow at
Japan in protest against her treat
ment of Americans in China.
WANT CHINESE LOAN
China is now repaying a $25,000,000
loan made last year. The one tenta
tively approved today was sponsored
by Committee Chairman Key Pitt
man who said "There is the greatest
desire on the part of the Adminis
tration to make the loan."
The House action came on two
amendments to the Stale Department
appropriation bill. They were spon
sored by Representative John Mc-
Cormack, D., Mass., and would have
eliminated funds for keeping open
the American embassy in Moscow
and for paying the $ 17,500 salary of
Ambassador Laurence Steinhardt.
The first was rejected 95 to 38 and
the second 108 to 105, after heated
debate in which many Congressmen
heaped calumny on Russia for her
invasion of Finland.
LOAN EXPANSION
The Senate is expected to take up
the loan bill tomorrow. Under its
provisions the Export-Import Batik,
at its discretion, can loan up to $20,-
000,000 of new money to "any coun
try." As drawn by the Senate
Banking and Currency Committee it
originally provided no more than
$5,000,000 could bo loaned to China,
the amount the Far Eastern nation
has repaid on its previous loan.
Pittman put through an amend
ment changing the language so China
can borrow up to $20,000,000. At the
same time Federal Loan Adminis
trator Jesse Jones confirmed a re
cent United Press dispatch saying
negotiations were under way with
Chinese officials for a new loan and
China was asking for $75,000,000.
Finland already has borrowed
$10,000,000.
Senator Prentiss Brown, D., Mich.,
said tomorrow he will introduce a
bill to authorize the Reconstruction
Finance Corporation to loan back
to Finland, without any restrictions,
$5,890,000, the amount the republic
has paid in principal and interest on
its post-war debt of $8,233,577.
