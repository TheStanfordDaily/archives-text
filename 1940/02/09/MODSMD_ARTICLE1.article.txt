Stanford grants aid to the
unfortunates of the world, it
plays no favorites.
If wo ever doubted that, we know
it today. When Excom appoints its
impartial, omniscient committees
next Tuesday night, and when the
Farm comes to the "benefit of bene
fits" next Thursday, the trouble
will just begin. All eligible groups
may apply for a cut of the funds-
Turkey for its earthquakes, the
United States for its migrants, Mo
naco for its Monte Carlo, the Abys
sinians for Hailie Selassie, Afghan
istan for its Amir, India for pants
for Mahatma Ghandi, Ireland for the
1.R.A., the Eskimos for igloos with
central heating—and, if there's any
left, the Finns may even get their
four-bits.
You can see there's practically
no limit to tliis sort of thing. Eng
land and France are not shower
ing their assistance over quite as
hroad a section of the globe,
though. After that General Staff
conference of Allied leaders this
week. Great Britain and France
are rushing to fortify Finland
with armed aid and manpower.
These reports coincided with word
from Helsinki that the Finnish
army is "suffering reverses" in its
attempts to beat back the Russian
invaders.

r JPIIE extent of these "reverses"—
about the first time the Finns
have admitted that things are not
well up that way—wasn't, known,
but British military experts believe
the Russians will be unable at this
time to force a decision in their
eight-day-old offensive against the
Mannerheim Line on the Karelian
Isthmus.
The English are interested in
seeing a Finnish victory. Any
losses in the Baltic region would
menace the security of Scandina
via. And every Finnish win is a
loss for the Russians—and for the
Germans. That's why Prime Min
ister Chamberlain told the House
that further British aid is en route
(o Finland and called their stand
an "admirable one."

THE first British volunteers for
Finland, including a lot of re
tired army officers, are expected to
leave for the Finnish fighting fronts
next week. France hasn't done
much in the way of sending actual
troops, but she is aiding the Finn
ish— and Allied — cause in other
ways. The French are relaying on
to Finland numbers of Italian war
planes which Germany refused to
allow to cross Reich territory en
route to Finland for fear of Russian
antagonism. Already some British
planes are in use with the Finnish
air force.
Great Britain and France, not
only helping to send Italian planes
to the Finns, are also prepared to
facilitate shipment of Italian vol
unteers to Finland. One group of
several hundred Mussolini-men
are supposedly ready to leave for
the north right now, hut due to
Germany's relations with Russia
it's impossible for them to lake a
direct route through the Reich.
So the French are ready to help
them across France, after which
they'll embark on a British ship
for Finland.
The British volunteers are prom
ised about two shillings a day—the
same pny they would receive in the
British army and considerably
higher than the French army pays.
The English think that, now, the
Finns will be able to handle their
own war for a while. The real crisis
will come in a few months, they be
lieve. And then Britain and France
may be able to pour troops into
Finland on a scale comparable to
Ihe German and Italian legionnaire
forces in the Spanish civil war.

eight-day-old offensive against the

next week. France hasn't done
much in the way of sending actual
troops, but she is aiding the Finn

ways. The French are relaying on
to Finland numbers of Italian war
planes which Germany refused to
allow to cross Reich territory en
route to Finland for fear of Russian
antagonism. Already some British
planes are in use with the Finnish
air force.
Great Britain and France, not
only helping to send Italian planes
to the Finns, are also prepared to
facilitate shipment of Italian vol
unteers to Finland. One group of
several hundred Mussolini-men
are supposedly ready to leave for
the north right now, hut due to
Germany's relations with Russia
it's impossible for them to lake a
direct route through the Reich.
So the French are ready to help
them across France, after which
they'll embark on a British ship
for Finland.
The British volunteers are prom

British army and considerably
higher than the French army pays.
The English think that, now, the
Finns will be able to handle their
