# Cooper Lays Full Blame On Germany
## Englishman Absolves Versailles Treaty Of All Responsibility 
### 
Under the title, "How It Hap
pened," Alfred Duff Cooper last night
gave a frankly pro-British, strongly
anti-Nazi account of the present
crisis in Europe. He labeled the suc
cessive acts of the Nazi government
during its power as the main cause
of the strife.
In attempting to trace the primary
causes of the second World War,
Mr. Cooper repudiated the claim that
the Versailles Treaty was respon
sible.
"The Treaty of Versailles was not
in any way responsible. I said, 'In
any way.' In one way it may have
been. It may have been too gen
erous, but it was not too rigorous."
BRITAIN DESIRED PEACE
Another contributing cause may
have been, according to Mr. Cooper,
the principle which guided Great
Britain after 1919â€”that of avoiding
war at all costs. "That is the most
dangerous principle possible," he
said.
"For many reasons the failure of
the League of Nations is one of the
causes of the present war," he con
tinued. "It inspired the confidence
of Europe, ... but its lack of en
, forcemcnt power was its great weak
ness.
SILVER LINING
"Although much evil came out of
the last war, some good came too:
(he world came to a new apprecia
tion of what war means."
As he neared the end of his lec
ture, Mr. Cooper's rhetoric efforts
doubled. He spoke tenderly of the
small republics of Latvia and Es
thonia, fiercely of a "horde of servile,
impudent . . . Bolsheviks, and stir
ringly of the "small, free, and glo
rious Finns."
An extreme reaction to Mr. Coo
per's lecture was displayed by the
woman who rushed up to the speaker
later during his informal question
period and, waving her fist, de
manded: "What do you know about
the Big Five?"
