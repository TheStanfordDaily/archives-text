of Hotinen, in the Sununar district,
with eight iron and concrete artillery
forts.
CAPTURE FIVE FORTS
"In the sector between Ladoga
Lake and Suvasijarvi Soviet troops
have captured five defensive iron
and concrete artillery forts.
"In both cases the enemy .suffered
great losses,
"Soviet aviation successfully
bombed military objectives."
It. was the first claim of a victory
on the Karelian Isthmus that the
Russian command had made in days
and appeared to mean that the Soviet
