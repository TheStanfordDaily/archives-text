# Ex Committee Accepts Impartial Relief Show In Compromise Action
## Executive Body in Special Session Decides on Non-Partisan Program; Show Slated for Thursday Night 
### DICK DUDMAN 
Finns, Poles, English, C.ermans, Russians, French, and earthquake
refugees in Turkey—all these can benefit from Stanford's revamped relief
entertainment.
Everyone who deserves it will get a share, including unfortunates in
the United States, when the time comes to divide the proceeds.

This was the compromise solution
to the current relief controversy,
reached yesterday when Ex Commit
tee broke the Stanford Union's bread
of peace at a joint luncheon meeting
with representatives of the campus
Finnish Relief Committee.
At the meeting yesterday, Ex Com
mittee stood by its refusal Tuesday
night, to make the proposed enter
tainment a student body activity, but.
passed a motion authorizing the
Finnish Relief Committee to present
the non-partisan entertainment.
Members of the relief organization
agreed yesterday afternoon by tele
phone vote to undertake the re
vised program, although the Finns
will be eligible for only part of the
proceeds.
THURSDAY GRANTED
Ex Committee, voting by telephone
last night, granted next Thursday
night as the date for the program,
which is to last from 8 to 5) o'clock
in Memorial Hall.
The motion approved by Ex Com
mittee follows:
"Tlie committee approves an en
tertainment for non-partisan re
lief, the proceeds to be distributed
to distressed areas of the world as
directed by a committee of our
own appointment. Every nation
shall have an equal opportunity
for consideration by the commit
tee."
After the motion had been framed,
Rob Putnam asked, "Mr. Chairman,
I assume that includes the United
States?" *
"Yes. No country will be pre
cluded from consideration," answer
ed President Cuthbertson.
Members decided to wait until
their meeting next Tuesday to ap
point the committee which will de
cide upon an equitable distribution
of funds collected through the en
tertainment.
AID FOR NAZIS?
During discussion of the motion to
approve the program, it. was sug
gested the Nazis and Communists
might need relief as much as the
Finns and Poles but "might not come
around to apply."
"That shouldn't enter into it; no
aggressor needs relief," Barney Fer
guson declared. "We all agree Rus
sia and Germany arc the aggres
sors."
Larry Livingston, Daily editor dis
agreed with this contention.
"I personally think Russia is the
invader," he said, "but. neither I
nor Hoover nor Wilbur nor Barney
Ferguson can decide for certain who
is an aggressor."
PARTISANSHIP DENIED
The question whelher or not the
national Finnish Relief Drive is
partisan was discussed, Bruco Jes
sup, representative of the local re
lief group insisting it. is not.
"Mr. Hoover would be the first to
deny his program is partisan," Jessup
declared.
"Didn't we decide Tuesday night
Finnish relief is partisan?" Living
ston asked.
Marian Guyselman, another mem
ber of the relief committee, said she
considered a poll of campus opinion
the" only logical solution. The com
mittee decided against a poll, how
ovc-r, after healing the arguments
offered by Student Manager John
Cobbs.
"This committee was elected to
handle matters of this sort," said
Cobbs. "1 can see no reason for a
poll.
negative result feared
"Supposing a poll should show
opinion to be against Finnish relief
instead of being a routine decision
on a specific question, Ex Commit
tee's action would become general
condemnation of a national humani
tarian program.
"An objectively worded question
Would give Finnish relief just as
good a chance of losing as of win
ning in an opinion poll. If it lost,
the University would take an awful
licking."
An opinion survey had been sug
gested earlier in the week by the Re
lief Committee in an effort to ap
peal Ex Committee's decision to
members of the student body.
Bill Woolston, third representative
of the relief group, said, however, a
poll would not be worth the pos
sible adverse publicity for the Uni
versity.
FINNS WILL GET SOME*
"Neither side wants to back
down, and I think a non-partisan j
entertainment will satisfy us both,"
he said. "Furthermore, the Finns
will get some of the money any
way."
Although several members asked
why funds collected could not be
distributed through the Red Cross,
they decided to name a special com
mittee for that purpose instead.
"The Red Cross is not primarily
for relief to civilians," Cuthbertson
explained.
Dr. D. Elton Trueblood, chairman j
of the Relief Committee, called a |
meeting of the group for this after-!
noon to continue plans for the en- I
tertainment.

An opinion survey had been sug
gested earlier in the week by the Re
lief Committee in an effort to ap
peal Ex Committee's decision to
members of the student body.
Bill Woolston, third representative
of the relief group, said, however, a
poll would not be worth the pos
sible adverse publicity for the Uni
versity.
FINNS WILL GET SOME*
"Neither side wants to back
down, and I think a non-partisan j
entertainment will satisfy us both,"
he said. "Furthermore, the Finns
will get some of the money any
way."
Although several members asked
why funds collected could not be
distributed through the Red Cross,
they decided to name a special com
mittee for that purpose instead.
"The Red Cross is not primarily
for relief to civilians," Cuthbertson
explained.
Dr. D. Elton Trueblood, chairman j
of the Relief Committee, called a |
meeting of the group for this after-!
noon to continue plans for the en- I
tertainment.
Finns, Poles, English, C.ermans, Russians, French, and earthquake
refugees in Turkey—all these can benefit from Stanford's revamped relief
entertainment.
Everyone who deserves it will get a share, including unfortunates in
the United States, when the time comes to divide the proceeds.

This was the compromise solution
to the current relief controversy,
reached yesterday when Ex Commit
tee broke the Stanford Union's bread
of peace at a joint luncheon meeting
with representatives of the campus
Finnish Relief Committee.
At the meeting yesterday, Ex Com
mittee stood by its refusal Tuesday
night, to make the proposed enter
tainment a student body activity, but.
passed a motion authorizing the
Finnish Relief Committee to present
the non-partisan entertainment.
Members of the relief organization
agreed yesterday afternoon by tele
phone vote to undertake the re
vised program, although the Finns
will be eligible for only part of the
proceeds.
THURSDAY GRANTED
Ex Committee, voting by telephone
last night, granted next Thursday
night as the date for the program,
which is to last from 8 to 5) o'clock
in Memorial Hall.
The motion approved by Ex Com
mittee follows:
"Tlie committee approves an en
tertainment for non-partisan re
lief, the proceeds to be distributed
to distressed areas of the world as
directed by a committee of our
own appointment. Every nation
shall have an equal opportunity
for consideration by the commit
tee."
After the motion had been framed,
Rob Putnam asked, "Mr. Chairman,
I assume that includes the United
States?" *
"Yes. No country will be pre
cluded from consideration," answer
ed President Cuthbertson.
Members decided to wait until
their meeting next Tuesday to ap
point the committee which will de
cide upon an equitable distribution
of funds collected through the en
tertainment.
AID FOR NAZIS?
During discussion of the motion to
approve the program, it. was sug
gested the Nazis and Communists
might need relief as much as the
Finns and Poles but "might not come
around to apply."
"That shouldn't enter into it; no
aggressor needs relief," Barney Fer
guson declared. "We all agree Rus
sia and Germany arc the aggres
sors."
Larry Livingston, Daily editor dis
agreed with this contention.
"I personally think Russia is the
invader," he said, "but. neither I
nor Hoover nor Wilbur nor Barney
Ferguson can decide for certain who
is an aggressor."
PARTISANSHIP DENIED
The question whelher or not the
national Finnish Relief Drive is
partisan was discussed, Bruco Jes
sup, representative of the local re
lief group insisting it. is not.
"Mr. Hoover would be the first to
deny his program is partisan," Jessup
declared.
"Didn't we decide Tuesday night
Finnish relief is partisan?" Living
ston asked.
Marian Guyselman, another mem
ber of the relief committee, said she
considered a poll of campus opinion
the" only logical solution. The com
mittee decided against a poll, how
ovc-r, after healing the arguments
offered by Student Manager John
Cobbs.
"This committee was elected to
handle matters of this sort," said
Cobbs. "1 can see no reason for a
poll.
negative result feared
"Supposing a poll should show
opinion to be against Finnish relief
instead of being a routine decision
on a specific question, Ex Commit
tee's action would become general
condemnation of a national humani
tarian program.

Marian Guyselman, another mem
ber of the relief committee, said she
considered a poll of campus opinion
the" only logical solution. The com
mittee decided against a poll, how
ovc-r, after healing the arguments
offered by Student Manager John
Cobbs.
"This committee was elected to
handle matters of this sort," said
Cobbs. "1 can see no reason for a
poll.
negative result feared
"Supposing a poll should show
opinion to be against Finnish relief
instead of being a routine decision
on a specific question, Ex Commit
tee's action would become general
condemnation of a national humani
tarian program.
"An objectively worded question
Would give Finnish relief just as
good a chance of losing as of win
ning in an opinion poll. If it lost,
the University would take an awful
licking."
An opinion survey had been sug
gested earlier in the week by the Re
lief Committee in an effort to ap
peal Ex Committee's decision to
members of the student body.
Bill Woolston, third representative
of the relief group, said, however, a
poll would not be worth the pos
sible adverse publicity for the Uni
versity.
FINNS WILL GET SOME*
"Neither side wants to back
down, and I think a non-partisan j
entertainment will satisfy us both,"
he said. "Furthermore, the Finns
will get some of the money any
way."
Although several members asked
why funds collected could not be
distributed through the Red Cross,
they decided to name a special com
mittee for that purpose instead.
"The Red Cross is not primarily
for relief to civilians," Cuthbertson
explained.
Dr. D. Elton Trueblood, chairman j
of the Relief Committee, called a |
meeting of the group for this after-!
noon to continue plans for the en- I
tertainment.
Finns, Poles, English, C.ermans, Russians, French, and earthquake
refugees in Turkey—all these can benefit from Stanford's revamped relief
entertainment.
Everyone who deserves it will get a share, including unfortunates in
the United States, when the time comes to divide the proceeds.

This was the compromise solution
to the current relief controversy,
reached yesterday when Ex Commit
tee broke the Stanford Union's bread
of peace at a joint luncheon meeting
with representatives of the campus
Finnish Relief Committee.
At the meeting yesterday, Ex Com
mittee stood by its refusal Tuesday
night, to make the proposed enter
tainment a student body activity, but.
passed a motion authorizing the
Finnish Relief Committee to present
the non-partisan entertainment.
Members of the relief organization
agreed yesterday afternoon by tele
phone vote to undertake the re
vised program, although the Finns
will be eligible for only part of the
proceeds.
THURSDAY GRANTED
Ex Committee, voting by telephone
last night, granted next Thursday
night as the date for the program,
which is to last from 8 to 5) o'clock
in Memorial Hall.
The motion approved by Ex Com
mittee follows:
"Tlie committee approves an en
tertainment for non-partisan re
lief, the proceeds to be distributed
to distressed areas of the world as
directed by a committee of our
own appointment. Every nation
shall have an equal opportunity
for consideration by the commit
tee."
After the motion had been framed,
Rob Putnam asked, "Mr. Chairman,
I assume that includes the United
States?" *
"Yes. No country will be pre
cluded from consideration," answer
ed President Cuthbertson.
Members decided to wait until
their meeting next Tuesday to ap
point the committee which will de
cide upon an equitable distribution
of funds collected through the en
tertainment.
AID FOR NAZIS?
During discussion of the motion to
approve the program, it. was sug
gested the Nazis and Communists
might need relief as much as the
Finns and Poles but "might not come
around to apply."
"That shouldn't enter into it; no
aggressor needs relief," Barney Fer
guson declared. "We all agree Rus
sia and Germany arc the aggres
sors."
Larry Livingston, Daily editor dis
agreed with this contention.
"I personally think Russia is the
invader," he said, "but. neither I
nor Hoover nor Wilbur nor Barney
Ferguson can decide for certain who
is an aggressor."
PARTISANSHIP DENIED
The question whelher or not the
national Finnish Relief Drive is
partisan was discussed, Bruco Jes
sup, representative of the local re
lief group insisting it. is not.
"Mr. Hoover would be the first to
deny his program is partisan," Jessup
declared.
"Didn't we decide Tuesday night
Finnish relief is partisan?" Living
ston asked.
