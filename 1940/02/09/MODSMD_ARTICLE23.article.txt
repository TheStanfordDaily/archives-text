# Russell Sets Final Proof Deadline
## 
### 
Quad proofs which have not been
returned from either this quarter or
last quarter must be taken to Room
15 in the Union before Wednesday,
Feb. 14, according to Newton Rus
sell, editor. It is necessary for pic
tures to be sent to the engravers
next week so it is imperative that
they be returned by that time.
All proofs are property of Mr.
Doherty, of the Fischer Studio in
San Francisco and must not be kept
by students. If students do not state
their preference as to which picture
they want in the annual, the Quad
staff will choose the print.

At Eskimo dinners, guests are re
quired by etiquette to carry away
the left-over food to show that they
enjoyed the meal.
