# Smoking Vote Reaches 2100
## Business Graduates To Tabulate Results 
### 
Over 2,100 Stanford students—ap
proxinii tely 50 pci cent of those reg
istered—-responded to the question
naires distributed recently for the
campus smoking survey conducted
by the Graduate School of Business,
and thereby provided what Profes
sor Robert Martin, chairman of the
survey committee, called "an amaz
ingly large sample."
The questionnaires were turned
over to the tabulations committee,
chairmanned by Dwight Zook, whose
work will be to record the answers
to the 55,000 items contained on the
total number of blanks.
The committee's first job, he de
clared yesterday, is to check the cov
erage of the returns to insure a l'ep
resentative sample, and to determine
if there is too low a proportion of
men, or of women, or of the various
living groups included in the sample
group to correspond with the actual
ratios on campus. It will be a week
or ten days before his committee can
turn over the findings to Robert
Smith, chairman of the tables and
charts committee.
