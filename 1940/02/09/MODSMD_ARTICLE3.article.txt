# Indian, Cal Game Rated Wide Open
## Cards Await Second Round Bell for Cage Battle Across Bay 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Making no predictions of any sort
at all but carrying with them every
trick they've learned this year, the
Stanfords cross the Bay Bridge to
night to come out fighting when the
bell rings for their second round
against California.
Coach Everett Dean's proteges, the
Indians, were awarded the first of
this four-round cage battle when
they out-pointed and out-finessed a
groggy Golden Bear quintet, man
aged by Coach Nibs Price, 55-32,
three weeks ago.
With this first T.K.O. basketball
victory under their belts, the locals
carry the fight to the Bears' lair in
Berkeley at 8 o'clock tonight in the
huge Men's Gymnasium. The little
Indians and the little Bears mix in
the preliminary at 6:30 o'clock, but
for the Class of '43ers that'll be just
as important as the varsity game.
NO FAVORITES PICKED
No efforts have been made to es
tablish a favorite for tonight's joust
in spite of the records. From Coach
Dean's viewpoint it'll be the team
which is hot that'll capture this all
important round. And that seems to
tell the whole story. No one knows
which team and which men will
have their shooting eyes—so unpre
dictable is this basketball!
From the Indians' standpoint,
they'll have to win in order to keep
within hailing distance of the South
ern Division leaders, the Trojans.
ANDERSON TO START
After part of a week of silence re
garding Fordy Anderson, regular
forward, Dean has announced that
the former Modesto Jaysee ace will
start against the Bears and prob
ably will play half the game. One
of the cleverest ball-handlers in the
business, Anderson was sorely missed
in the U.S.C. games and last week's
double-header with St. Mary's and
Santa Clara.
His work was capably handled by
Leon Lafaille and Bob Penn, but
with Anderson back Stanford's
splendid offensive showing in the
first game against Ucla may be re
peated. Again Don Williams, Stan
ford's high scoring forward, will be
more of a threat what with the
Bears having to concentrate on An
derson and him.
To show that records don't prove
a thing let's go into the past two
