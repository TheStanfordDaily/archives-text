## U.S.C. Tilt Tops Home Sports Slate Varsity Footballers Lead Troy Line-up; Close Bout Expected 
### PAT NOWELL 
fn the first game of the 1!)40 in
tercollegiate season, the Stanford
rugby team tangles with U.S.C.
tomorrow afternoon at 2:30 o'clock
in the Stadium. Admission is 25
cents with student body cards, and
50 cents to the general public.
This will be the first game of the
season for the Trojans, while Stan
ford has played — and won—one
game, defeating the University Club,
6-3.
U.S.C. varsity footballers form
the backbone of the line-up for El
Trojan. Jack Banta, hard-hitting
fullback, is one of the mainstays of
the club that will play tomorrow,
as is Ed Dempsey, regular center
from Howard Jones' team. Other
gridders who will be in the South
ern California starting combination
are Bob Jones, Floyd Phillips, Rus
sel Roquet, and Charles Morrill.
For Stanford, Coaches Jim Wylie,
Willard Clausen, and Harry Maloney
will pit American footballers Hugh
Gallarneau, Pete Kmetovic, Jake
Thompson, and Paul Ugrin against
the men of Troy. The rest of the
Cardinal line-up is composed mostly
of veterans from last year's once
defeated outfit.
In anticipation of a tough, hard
fought contest, the Farm coaching
staff has been pouring it on in
practice, and has pronounced the
squad to be in good shape for to
morrow's contest.
Despite S.C.'s lack of practice
games, the Cards are not underesti
mating their opponents' ability. The
lads from Los Angeles and vicinity
are big, fast, and plenty tough, and
can always be expected to produce
opposition of the stiffest caliber.
The probable line-ups:
Stanford: Forwards—Ugrin. Bar
nard, Morgan, Pierce, Hicking
botham (c), deMailly, Thompson,
Pugh; backs — Rodgers. Olden,
Kmetovic, Gallarneau, McMurray,
Jedenoff, Geissler.
Southern California: Forwards—
Jones, Phillips, Vail, Folmer,
Doyle, Roquet, Dempsey, Tyler;
backs—Morrill, McKenzie, Banta,
Wood, Steckel, Hindley, Beeson.
