## JERRY MAYER, Sports Editor Potent Frosh Five Faces Cal Tonight at Berkeley First Series Game Rivalry keen As Papooses Meet Much-Heralded Blue-and-Gold Cub Basketballers 
### 
Willi all hands on deck and ready for action, Stanford's freshman bas
ketball team does battle tonight with the California frosh in the Men's
| Gymnasium at Berkeley.
in (his, the first of the annual three-game series between the two
teams, Stanford faces one of the most potent Cub quintets in many a year.

However, potent or not, the Berke-+
i leyites just did manage to eke out a i
] 37-36 victory over the U.S.F. frosh I
i last Tuesday.
The Papoose cage squad will go i
i into tonight's contest with a bril- '
! liant record in the Cal-Stanford i
i frosh series to uphold. For the Card ;
J yearlings have won the first game, j
| and the series, for the last several I
i years. In 1938 the frosh took the |
Cubs down the line in three straight |
: games, while in '39 they copped the i
first two contests to win the series,'
: but lost the final game.
FROSII AT PEAK
The frosh have about reached |
j their peak of condition, both phys- '
ically and mentally, according to j
Frosh Coach Lee. They have been j
I pointing for this game all year, Lee
| said.
Of course, the Card yearlings may II
lose tonight and then come back to
take the next two games and the!
j series; but a win tonight woukl ease
the pressure.
RECORDS PREDICT TUSSLE
i It' records are any criteria, to
; night's tussle will be a nip-and-tuck 1
affair from the opening whistle, for j
both Cal and Stanford present fresh
man teams that have topped almost
: all of their respective opponentsâ€”
1 almost, because each team has
dropped one game this season.
According to Lee, the Stanford
frosh will start with Walt Funabiki
and Leo McCaffrey at guards, and
three of the following four boys at]
I the center and two forward posts: j
| Jack Dana, Ed Stamm, Fred Linari, I
and Ed Voss. If Voss opens at cen- j
1 ter, it will be Dana or Linari at for
wards; but if Stamm takes the cen
ter spot at the outlet, a combination :
from the Dana-Linari-Voss trio will !
open at forwards.
