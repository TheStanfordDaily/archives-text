CASCADING torrents of criticism from places
as high as the President's office and as
low as Encina basement have failed to budge
Ex Committee from its conviction that giving
humanitarian relief to a single warring nation is
not neutral.
Although they stood firm in this belief, at
the same time the representatives disproved
charges that Stanford students are smug, self
centered, and disinterested in the significant
events that are taking place outside of their
own petty sphere. They decided to hold a
benefit entertainment, not just for the Finns,
but for the relief of stricken areas all over the
world.
One cry Ex Committee did not answerâ€”the
accusation made by several students that main
taining a policy of strict neutrality (in an actual
as well as a political science classroom sense)
is cowardly and dishonorable.
These immature, ill-considered contentions of
the "Make the World Safe for Democracy
Again" partisans really are not worthy of con
sideration. It is evident that they do not believe
in the principle of learning something of value
from a bitter experience.
On Nov. 2, 1914, the headline in The Daily
Palo Alto (forerunner of The Stanford Daily)
read: STANFORD TO BE VANGUARD IN BEL
GIAN RELIEF CAMPAIGN.
On April 7, 1917, it said: BE READY WHEN
TIME COMES, PRESIDENT WILBUR AND WAR
CHIEFS URGE.
If The Stanford Daily for Feb. 7, 1940, had
campaigned for the A.S.S.U. to lead in partisan
relief once again, it easily could have been in
viting history to repeat itself.
However, in this campus move to insure
peace, as in every worth-while project, someone
was bound to go overboard. Yesterday morn
ing the Stanford Sentinel, official publication of
the local chapter of the American Student Un
ion, not only advocated that solutions of all the
United States' economic problems must be
reached before we can give aid to any foreign
country, but also carried certain misleading in
formation about ex-President Herbert Hoover.
Implying that Stanford's most famous alum
nus is conducting his relief work with partisan
intent, the A.S.U. organ quoted statements al
legedly made by him, refusing to give aid to
Russia during the great famine of 1921, "even
if it means hundreds of thousands of children
starving." As a matter of fact, at that time
Hoover was doing humanitarian work not only
in the Allied nations but also in Germany and
Soviet Russia.
The American Student Union obviously is
suffering from another case of over-enthusiasm.
The attitude that we must not give a single
cent to aid the victims of foreign wars and nat
ural disasters until the last unemployed work
er and migrant have disappeared from the face
of the United States is open to a certain amount
of condemnation as a narrow one.
It is true that we have problems at home that
are crying for solution, but that is no reason why
we should not help foreigners caught in emer
gency situations, man-made and otherwise.
Since Ex Committee's scheduled benefit is
unquestionably non-partisan, since the money
it will raise will go to clothe the naked and
feed the starving, there can be no criticism of
the plan on either of these scores.
But it may become a little embarrassing when
every nation in the world comes to claim its
share of the money.
