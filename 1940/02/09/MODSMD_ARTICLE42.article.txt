# The
						Rabble Roars
## 
### 
TONIGHT many from Stanford will go over
to the University of California basketball
pavilion where the rabble is rowdy and their
noise is great in volume and small in sports
manship.
Those who have not made the trip to Berkeley
before will have their eyes opened. It is not
simply that they will see Stanford outnumbered
five to one, and easily out-shouted at every turn.
It is that they are certain to be shocked at the
poor sportsmanship in the California rooters'
mass enthusiasm.
A sports columnist wrote recently in an Oak
land newspaper that the Bears can count on at
least 10 points a game from their loyal sup
porters.
He knew what he was talking about.
It is natural that California rooters should
yell, and that their 6000 voices should distract
Stanford's basketball team, used to the small
Farm Pavilion.
But it is not natural that they should boo the
officials' decisions with such vehemence that
nine times out of ten they will be forced into
relaxing their authority or tightening up to the
point of pettiness to prove they can't be bluffed.
It is not natural for Stanford to play a five- |
man basketball team with 6000 ringers.—D. ]. j
