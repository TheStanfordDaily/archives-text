NEUTRALITY MAKES STRANGE BEDFELLOWS
r JpiIE Finns and the Russians aren't the only ones who
are fighting. The Stanford campus is warring from
the English Corner to the President's home. And it is
interesting to note how the hodge-podge of world
views has affected opinion on the Finnish Relief Pro
gram and neutrality.
Lined up against Stanford support of the Finns are
the A.S.U. and some of the A.S.U.'s most steadfast
critics. (See editorial one column over.) At first glance
it would seem that neutrality is a rather non-partisan
affair—a free-for-all with the road open to liberals,
conservatives, and radicals.
Some neutrality-minded warriors think that Finn
ish aid is bad because Russian aid is better. Other
"neutrals" (neutral in a very limited sense) think that
Finnish aid is bad because partisanship is bad. Still
others think that Finnish aid is good because it has
nothing to do with neutrality and a great deal to do
with humanity. There is a perfect set-up for a phi
losopher—a field day for value theorists.

¥>ART of the confusion of sides and opinions arises
from the fact that a good many of us are not sure
just what to believe in. Most people unite in con
demning a few relatively obvious results of the great
economic and political forces that result in periodic
explosions: war, persecution, and aggression. And a
few of the more broad-minded include starvation.
But as to the economic and political forces them
selves, few have any long-range convictions. And so
the specific decisions—from Finnish relief to cash
and-carry export—can't always be justified on the
basis of some desirable, future-bent program. In
terest is focused not on long-range convictions, but on
sensational, specific cases: helping the needy or keep
ing hands off. Important as such good Samaritan
issues are, there are more important, if less dramatic
issues that demand American attention.
Chief among these is the solution of our country's
economic maladjustments. It was economic pressure
more than funds for the wounded that forced us into
the last war. This economic pressure, unfortunately,
can be alleviated only by economic measures, not by
closing our ears to Duff Cooper.
But meanwhile it is a good thing that Stanford has
finally compromised on a relief drive for all nations'
wounded. For a while yesterday it looked as though
a soap-box on the English Corner was the next move.

losopher—a field day for value theorists.

¥>ART of the confusion of sides and opinions arises
from the fact that a good many of us are not sure
just what to believe in. Most people unite in con
demning a few relatively obvious results of the great
economic and political forces that result in periodic
explosions: war, persecution, and aggression. And a
few of the more broad-minded include starvation.
But as to the economic and political forces them
selves, few have any long-range convictions. And so
the specific decisions—from Finnish relief to cash
and-carry export—can't always be justified on the
basis of some desirable, future-bent program. In
terest is focused not on long-range convictions, but on
sensational, specific cases: helping the needy or keep
ing hands off. Important as such good Samaritan
issues are, there are more important, if less dramatic
issues that demand American attention.
Chief among these is the solution of our country's
economic maladjustments. It was economic pressure
more than funds for the wounded that forced us into
the last war. This economic pressure, unfortunately,
can be alleviated only by economic measures, not by
closing our ears to Duff Cooper.
But meanwhile it is a good thing that Stanford has
finally compromised on a relief drive for all nations'
wounded. For a while yesterday it looked as though
a soap-box on the English Corner was the next move.
NEUTRALITY MAKES STRANGE BEDFELLOWS
r JpiIE Finns and the Russians aren't the only ones who
are fighting. The Stanford campus is warring from
the English Corner to the President's home. And it is
interesting to note how the hodge-podge of world
views has affected opinion on the Finnish Relief Pro
gram and neutrality.
Lined up against Stanford support of the Finns are
the A.S.U. and some of the A.S.U.'s most steadfast
critics. (See editorial one column over.) At first glance
it would seem that neutrality is a rather non-partisan
affair—a free-for-all with the road open to liberals,
conservatives, and radicals.
Some neutrality-minded warriors think that Finn
ish aid is bad because Russian aid is better. Other
"neutrals" (neutral in a very limited sense) think that
Finnish aid is bad because partisanship is bad. Still
others think that Finnish aid is good because it has
nothing to do with neutrality and a great deal to do
with humanity. There is a perfect set-up for a phi
