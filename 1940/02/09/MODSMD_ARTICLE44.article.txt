# CAMPUS OPINION
## NEUTRALITY BE DAMNED 
### 
r jpHE EDITOR, SIR:
Words fail me in expressing my disappointment
and digust at the action of the Ex Committee, even to
the extent of expressing the hope that students would
give the drive their support.
The statement by one of the members of the Ex
Committee to the effect that "it supposed to be neu
tral and that Ls what it is supposed to be," illustrates
the effectiveness of peace propaganda which has un
dermined the morals of America. What satisfaction
anyone gets out of trying to be neutral in the Russian-
Finnish War is something I just can't understand. . . .
. . . This insane submission to isolationist and ultra
pacifist propagandaâ€”this relief that always being neu
tral is something to be proud of, is plain offensive to
the intelligence and the dignity of the American
people.
It is to be hoped that the local Finnish Relief Com
mittee will not be stopped by the "morally courag
eous"(?) stand of the Ex Committee. While it can't
expect to rally the support which attends such worthy
and valuable functions as Back-to-the-Farm-Wear-
Your-Overalls-Don't-Shave Week, nevertheless it will
attract the support of some who don't pretend to be
neutral and are not ashamed of it, and who believe
that the cause of Finland is worthy of all the aid
possible.
