Dr. Wilbur in his opposition to the A.S.S.U.'s
stand on Finnish relief fails pitifully to distinguish be
tween neutrality and humanitarianism.
Certainly it would be very humanitarian to give
the Finns aid in the form of medical supplies, food,
clothing, ctc., because they are starving, freezing, and
dying of illness. But, I'll wager fifty Russians are
starving to death for every one Finn that's dying. If
that is so, why don't we send our money to both Fin
land and Russia? Why? Because we aren't neutral.
Moreover, Dr. Wilbur and his Finnish relief friends
ax*e doing a very one-sided job of playing Santa Claus.
