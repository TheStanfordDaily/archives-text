# THEY PAY THEIR DEBTS

EDITOR, SIR:
. . . The Finns are innocent victims and any
victories which they may make are due to their great
desire for peace, not to any military advantages over
their enemy. . . . Haven't the Finns proved their good
will toward the United States more than any other
country? When other wealthier nations were spending
their money on rearmament and programs of war, Ihe
Finns preferred to pay their debt to us . .
Students of other colleges have often accused Stan
ford students of being high-brow. If we take such a
ridiculous stand on a question which has national sup
port, we shall have merited this reputation.
Sincerely,
Mildred Olsen, '41
