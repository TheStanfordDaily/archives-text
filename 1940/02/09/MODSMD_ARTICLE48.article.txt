# DOES RELIEF MEAN WAR?
## 
### 
r pIE EDITOR. SIR:
The "morally courageous" Excom can now rest
content, with its step to keep the United States out of
war by its refusal to officially sanction the proposed
Finnish Relief drive. . . .
It was asserted in your column Wednesday that the
donations for Belgian relief in-the last war was an
expression of sympathy by our people which was one
in a long list of events ending with our active par
ticipation. I suppose if we hadn't raised the relief
fund we would have stayed out. of war? (Incidentally,
are we clad the Allies won that war?)
It may bo that most of Stanford's undergraduates
don't care whether human riphts are erased outside
j out holders or not. or if thov do. thev must bo in the
| same chicken-coop with Excom, claiming non-action
j the cure-all for international wrong, and (he guardian
I angel of these United States.
