The Editor, Sir:
. . . We travel a path in 1918,
and come back for another look in
1940. This nation really needed
Borah. But in our case, suppose we
pretend for once that Stanford is an
intellectual institution with the abil
ity to foresee to some slight degree
the true implications of its actions.
Vernon Donlavy, Jr.
