The Editor, Sir:
... If the Ex Committee's action
is representative of the way Amer
ica is going to stay out of war, then
it would seem certain that we will
be in it very soon, for if we can
not face the problems with a clear
mind, and if we do not have the
courage and foresight to recognize
the facts as they are, how can we
possibly solve these problems. The
Ex Committee is emulating the well
known ostrich.
The members of it (with the happy
exception of Miss Coline Upshaw,
who evidently knows what is going
on in the world) would do well to
try to understand the situation be
fore they proudly beat, their breasts
and exclaim that they are keeping
us out of war. . . .
