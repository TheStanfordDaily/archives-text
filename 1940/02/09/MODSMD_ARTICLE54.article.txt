### 
"KITTY FOYLE," by Christopher Morley; J. H. Lippincott Company.
Friends of Christopher Morley as America's pet second-string essayist
are in for a hard, rude jolt. In Kitty Foyle, his newest novel—reprinted
eight times since its appearance in October—the whimsical bystander of
"Swiss Family Manhattan" not only writes the story of, but IS. a gutty.

middle-class little Irish tougme who<
refers to herself as "that wench K. I
Foyle."
The reaction of the reader is as
important, almost, as the story that j
underlies Kitty's stream - of - con
sciousness reminiscences of her rau- j
cous Orangeman of a father, her j
girlhood in Philadelphia, and her
business life in New York. The way
Morley gets under the skin of a
woman as realistic, as knowing, as
utterly female as K. Foyle is more
than uncanny or amazing.
COMMITS SOME ERRORS
Sometimes he commits errors in j
taste, completely aside from the,
ones Kitty indulges in spasmodically;
but always there's this sense ol' how
did he do it? And you finally de
cide (a) that he patched the story up
out of innumerable fragments from
his imagination, (b) that he really
knows this type of womankind that '
well, or (c) that someone had a few
too many and had to cry it out to
someone, and it happened to be
Christopher.
Kitty begins in 1924 with her life
as the daughter of Philadelphia's
most beloved cricket coach, who
knows all the swells. She jumps
forward and back: to her high school,
her short fling at college, her meet
ing with Delphine Detaille (Elizabeth
Arden, Helena Rubenstein, or some- i
one like them).
LOVE AFFAIR THEME
All through is the thread of her
wild, hurting, and often sordid love j
affair with Wyn Stafford VI, who ■
was so one of Philadelphia's best !
families that he had an inferiority i
complex about his social superiority. ■
Perhaps he was a heel, you don't ;
know.
All you realize is that by the time j
Kitty is an executive in the most
glamorous cosmetic concern in the
country in 1938, she is absolutely at
the end of her tether, and she faces
a choice of being a bitter white- j
collar girl for the rest of her life or j
marrying a man whom she finds ]
kind, attentive, and utterly repulsive, i
Otherwise she is sitting on top of the j
world.
UNTOUCHED PERIOD
This book's worth as a literary |
document will be based, aside from
Morley's amazing trick, on his telling i
the story of an average working girl I
during a period scarcely touched j
upon, and intensely interesting — I
1930-38.
It's a complete picture of a small j
social and economic revolution, of i
the ethics resulting from the war and |
the depression, a testimonial to the j
utter inviolability of the middle class j
in America.—Gould
