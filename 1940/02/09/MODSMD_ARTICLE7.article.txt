THE EFFECT of 2,000.000 elecrtical volts on a 2x4 wooden plank is
vividly demonstrated in this double exposure picture. The original
exposure is that of the electrical holt contacting the plank; an ex
posure a fraction of a second after shows the same lw>ard split in two.
The experiment was conducted in the Ryan High Voltage laboratory
using the new lightning machine.
