# Farm Professors Construct Powerful Lightning Machine
## 
### 
A switch closed, and more electricity than runs through San Francisco
power lines crashed through the atmosphere of Stanford's Ryan High
Voltage laboratory forming a 2,000,000-volt spark. Such is the power
of the Farm's recently perfected lightning machine.
But why a lightning machine? Three Stanford professors constructed

( this new generator as a means of
carrying on extensions in the re
search program of the laboratory.
With it they will study the protec
tion of power systems from wild
lightning.
WATCH LIGHTNING
"One of the ways to learn about
lightning is to watch wild lightning
in the sky, to photograph it and
measure it if possible," explained Dr.
William C. Hoover, co-constructor of
the generator. "The other is to work
with 'tamo' lightning in the labora
tory, where it is easily controlled
and measured at will."
The lightning bolt created by this
machine is, however, far from being
tame. It can comse down the grain
of a piece of timber splitting it in
two, and it can explode a copper
wire to nothingness, at, the same
time leaving the surrounding cotton
insulation untouched. And its spark
can jump 10 feet through space.
POWER GAINED
One of the largest and most mod
ern of generators in American uni
versities, the Ryan laboratory gen
erator gains its power from a flow
of only 25 kilowatt-seconds which
are stored in electro-static condens
ors during the charging period.
"It is all very simple," said Dr.
Hoover, describing the lightning gen
erator. "There are 20 electrostatic
condensers. These are charged to
100,000 volts each. They are then
connected in series so that the total
voltage is the sum of 20 individual
voltages, and they discharge with a
force of 2,000,000 volts."
"That is all."
