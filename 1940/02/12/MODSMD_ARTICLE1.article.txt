r jPHE political speech-making and
ballyhoo, the blare of brass
bands, and America's three-ring
circus of election time are all on
the way.
There's something in the air.
Maybe you haven't noticed it. The
Finns and the Russians have been
taking up the headline space. Boats
have been torpedoed and blockades
established. And, ever since that
fateful day last September when the
legions of Adolf Hitler goose-stepped
into Poland, Europe has held the
spotlight.
* * *
In the next few months, though,
America's own |M>litical side-show
will begin to sneak a little atten
tion. When Farley's Democrats
decided to hold their convention
in Chicago, the Republicans speed
ed their G.O.P. machinery. There's
strong sentiment in their ranks to
hold their nominating convention
on July 1 and rededicate the party
to what they call "a new spirit of
independence."
Right now the choice of a conven
tion city lie between Chicago, where
the Democrats will hang out, and
Philadelphia, the runner-up. A $200,-
000 bid from Houston, Texas, isn't
regarded very seriously. The time
and place probably will be definitely
decided when the national commit
tee meets in Washington next Fri
day.

J>ARTY chieftains have about
abandoned hopes of delaying
their convention until the Demo
crats have selected a candidate and
a platform. These plans were chang
ed after the Democratic national
committee empowered Farley to set
the date last week. He said he
would do so immediately after the
Republicans act. And this savors of
the old Alphone-Gaston business.
At least this bit of Democratic
strategy has stopped agitation from
Republicans that the convention
be held in early autumn instead
of mid-summer for purposes of
economy and in order that public
interest may be better maintained
in the presidential campaign. The
general feeling now is that since
the Republicans can't out wait the
Democrats, there's no advantage
in delaying choice of a candidate
and a platform.
House Majority Leader Martin,
wha was, you may remember, east
ern campaign manager for former
Governor Alf Landon, who toted the
Republican standard in 1936, often
has been mentioned as a potential
vice-presidential candidate —if the
G.O.P. selects a mid-westerner to
head its ticket in November .He
doesn't much want second place,
preferring the House speakership if
Republicans should win control of
that chamber.
# * sjt
they might do it. Only a
five per cent increase in the
Republican congressional vote in
November would give the party 64
additional seats in the House and a
working majority provided, of
course, that none of the present mi
nority members is unseated. Martin
not only is confident, that Repub
licans will win control of the House,
but said that a recent poll by an
eatern firm showed that the G.O.P.
would regain the presidency by a
minimum of 312 electoral votes. Of
course Martin didn't say who made
the estimate.
Anyway, at the end of the week !
Martin was about the only Repub
lican leader left in the capital. The
others arc scattered around the na
tion making Lincoln Day speeches
or pushing their presidential can
didacies. Vandenberg spoke in a
radio duel in Washington with
Senator Byrnes over budget bal
ancing and economy. Landon and
Farley shared a non-partisan plat
form at Springfield, 111., and Thom- j
as Dewey is on a quest for west
ern delegates.

strong sentiment in their ranks to
hold their nominating convention
on July 1 and rededicate the party
to what they call "a new spirit of
independence."
Right now the choice of a conven
tion city lie between Chicago, where
the Democrats will hang out, and
Philadelphia, the runner-up. A $200,-

their convention until the Demo

a platform. These plans were chang
ed after the Democratic national
committee empowered Farley to set
the date last week. He said he
would do so immediately after the
Republicans act. And this savors of
the old Alphone-Gaston business.
At least this bit of Democratic
strategy has stopped agitation from
Republicans that the convention
be held in early autumn instead
of mid-summer for purposes of
economy and in order that public
interest may be better maintained
