# Lagunita Nears Overflow Mark
## 
### 
With the water only four inches
below the overflow mark, Lake La
gunita is at its highest level in two
years.
In the first week of boat house ac
tivity, a few hardy swimmers have
already braved the water's mid
winter chill and four boats have
been launched. Three floats, two in
the middle of the lake and one near
the dock, are now in use.
Until wanner weather, the boat
house will only be open from 1 to 5
in the afternoon on weekdays, and
from 10 to 6 on Saturdays and Sun
days. A coke machine is on hand,
and candy and cigarettes may go on
sale soon.
With a capacity for 54 canoes, the
boathouse is expected to be filled
as soon as all the dormitories, clubs,
and houses have installed their boats.
