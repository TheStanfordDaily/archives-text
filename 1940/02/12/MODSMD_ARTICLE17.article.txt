## Health Service Diagnoses 22.000 Cases Annually 
### BUD AMES 
"Jones, Jones—oh, Mr. Jones."
Quiet-voiced Nurse Dorothy Davis
was calling from behind her desk
in the Men's Health Service to a
waiting student who sat leafing
.through a magazine. The student
] jumped suddenly to his feet and
J walked confidently into the doctor's
office.
In just the same way last year
J Mrs. Davis called to over 22,000 visi
| tors, representing 85 per cent of all
j Stanford men, who liad come for
| medical advice — not medical treat
j ment.
DIAGNOSIS ONLY
"The Health Service doctors give
to each student requesting it an ex
ceptionally good office examination
following diagnostic principles,"
said Dr. Thomas A. Storey, general
director of the School of Hygiene
and Physical Education. "But it must
be understood that the Health Serv
ice is not in competition with the
private practitioner. We help a boy
arrive at. an understanding of his
trouble and then hi> selects the doc


NAME PLEASE." asks Nurse Dorothy Davis of the advice-seeking Warren Sleeper, who is just one of
he 22.000 to call at the Men's Health Service during the year.
tor he wants to take care of him."
The present Health Service is the
product of the experience of almost
500 American universities in their
dealings with student health prob
lems. It is supported today by funds
from the University, and
gymnasium fees; and its director is
Dr. Charles E. Shepard.
SHEPARI) IS TOPS
"There is no better man in this
line of work in the United States
than Dr. Shepard," stated Dr.
Storey.
And behind Dr. Shepard stand
two other full-time doctors, seven
part-time men, and 21 consultants
who may be called for completion of
examinations or for special diag
nosis—for which service they charge
nothing. Incidentally, there is no
practitioner of medicine in Palo
Alto at the present time who is not
working, or has not at some time
worked, on Stanford's Men's Health
Service.
TWO NURSES AID
And behind this army of medical
men stand the service's two attend
ing nurses, Mrs. Dorothy Davis and
Miss Dorothea Rickenberg.
""'Mrs. Davis is our public relations
conimittee," said Dr. Storey. "Our
service must be a friendly service,
and it's up to Mrs Davis to see that
each student gets what he wants."
In her quiet, business-like way,
Mrs. Davis does just that. As each
student approaches her desk, he
gives his name to her and expresses
his needs. Mrs. Davis always smiles
and then turns to
her files, in which are kept the con
fidential medical records of every
Stanford man. Then she ushers the
student to a chair or magazine table.
As she turns, another student ap
proaches and it begins all over again.
RICKENBERG TESTS
In her free moments, Mrs. Davis
chats through the open door with
Miss Rickenberg, who works in the
adjoining laboratory. Miss Ricken
berg is a short woman who—as she
busies herself with test tubes, tem
peratures, and blood samples — al
ways seems to bd laughing from

behind glasses. She loves to chat
with the complaining men.
And ther\ a buzzer hums, and a
little arrow jerks indicating that
another doctor is free. Mrs. Davis
leaps into action.
"Smith, Mr. Smith, you can go in
now."
And in the laboratory, Miss R.:'k
enberg is chatting with a student
who holds a thermometer in his
mouth and reads a newspaper.
