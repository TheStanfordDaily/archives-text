# Farm Officials, Palo Alto Ask Highway Commission Funds to Build Underpass
## Supporters Propose Unification Of Palm Drive, El Camino Railroad Projects to Save Building Expense 
### JACK BURTT 
University officials and the City of Palo Alio are co-operating to
the California State Highway Commission to appropriate nearly $100,000,
half the sum required, to finance construction of the proposed El Camino
Ideal-University Avenue underpass before the railroad underpass is com
pleted.
Both the city and the University point out that unification of the two
projects would he a convenience to the public, since the end of University

is already closed, and Palm
Drive can lie shut of! without great
added inconvenience.
"Besides conveniencing the public,
about $35,000 could l>e saved by
building both underpasses at the
same time," Dean Samuel B. Morris,
of the School of Engineering, com
mented. Dean Morris is also head
of the Palo Alto Board of Public
Works, which last week addressed a
letter to the Highway Commission
urging tljat the highway underpass
be built at the same time as the rail
road underpass.
FINANCES MAY BE OBSTACLE
He said that the money would be
saved because surplus dirt, available
from the railroad underpass, could
be used for fills, and because it would
be cheaper to tie in the approach to
the railroad underpass with the end
of Palm Drive if the two were built
at the same time.
Only sticking point in the plans
to save the University about six
' months' use of Palm Drive is that
finances may not be available. The
El Camino Real underpass will cost,
about $200,000, of which only about
$90,000 is at hand. The City of Palo
Alto has already authorized the state
to appropriate this amount from city
gasoline tax incomes for the next two
bienniums.
UNIVERSITY TO GRANT LANDS
The University, it is understood,
will grant the necessary lands for the
project as soon as construction is
authorized. The University holds
title on the land from the highway to
the railroad 1 racks, north to San
Francisquito Creek and south to the
printing plant. The land is leased to
Palo Alto.
Plans for the projected highway
underpass, which will route traffic
underneath the University Avenue
entrance to the campus, have been
under consideration since the rail
road underpass was conceived sev
eral years ago.
STATE MAKES PLANS
A federal appropriation, as a part
of the government program to elim
inate railroad grade crossings, fi
nanced the railroad underpass now
under construction. The plans were
worked out. by the state, Palo Alto
furnished the right-of-way, and the
city and the railroad jointly agreed
to maintain the structure.
The highway underpass was first
presented over a year ago as a PWA
project, with the city furnishing 55
per cent and the federal government
45 per cent of the funds. The fed
eral grant was denied.
The University has already granted
one and one-quarter acres of land
for the railroad underpass, and will
grant, four or five more for the high
way project. The total value of the
land is placed at between $10,000
and $20,000.
If the Highway Commission is un
able to furnish the money at. present,
the project will be carried through
sometime between 1041 and 194.'5,
according to present plans of the
Highway Commission. This will
mean that Palm Drive and University
Avenue will be shut off again for a
period of about six months.

the railroad underpass with the end
of Palm Drive if the two were built
at the same time.
Only sticking point in the plans
to save the University about six
' months' use of Palm Drive is that
finances may not be available. The
El Camino Real underpass will cost,
about $200,000, of which only about
$90,000 is at hand. The City of Palo
Alto has already authorized the state
to appropriate this amount from city
gasoline tax incomes for the next two
bienniums.
UNIVERSITY TO GRANT LANDS
The University, it is understood,
will grant the necessary lands for the
project as soon as construction is
authorized. The University holds
title on the land from the highway to
the railroad 1 racks, north to San
Francisquito Creek and south to the
printing plant. The land is leased to
Palo Alto.
Plans for the projected highway
underpass, which will route traffic
underneath the University Avenue
entrance to the campus, have been
under consideration since the rail
road underpass was conceived sev
eral years ago.
STATE MAKES PLANS
A federal appropriation, as a part
of the government program to elim
inate railroad grade crossings, fi
nanced the railroad underpass now
under construction. The plans were
worked out. by the state, Palo Alto
furnished the right-of-way, and the
city and the railroad jointly agreed
to maintain the structure.
The highway underpass was first
presented over a year ago as a PWA
project, with the city furnishing 55
per cent and the federal government
45 per cent of the funds. The fed
eral grant was denied.
The University has already granted
one and one-quarter acres of land
for the railroad underpass, and will
grant, four or five more for the high
way project. The total value of the
land is placed at between $10,000
and $20,000.
If the Highway Commission is un
able to furnish the money at. present,
the project will be carried through
sometime between 1041 and 194.'5,
according to present plans of the
Highway Commission. This will
mean that Palm Drive and University
Avenue will be shut off again for a
period of about six months.
University officials and the City of Palo Alio are co-operating to
the California State Highway Commission to appropriate nearly $100,000,
half the sum required, to finance construction of the proposed El Camino
Ideal-University Avenue underpass before the railroad underpass is com
pleted.
Both the city and the University point out that unification of the two
projects would he a convenience to the public, since the end of University

is already closed, and Palm
Drive can lie shut of! without great
added inconvenience.
"Besides conveniencing the public,
about $35,000 could l>e saved by
building both underpasses at the
same time," Dean Samuel B. Morris,
of the School of Engineering, com
mented. Dean Morris is also head
of the Palo Alto Board of Public
Works, which last week addressed a
letter to the Highway Commission
urging tljat the highway underpass
be built at the same time as the rail
road underpass.
FINANCES MAY BE OBSTACLE
He said that the money would be
saved because surplus dirt, available
from the railroad underpass, could
be used for fills, and because it would
be cheaper to tie in the approach to
the railroad underpass with the end
of Palm Drive if the two were built
at the same time.
