# First Lady Speaks For Finn Relief
## Youth Congress Urged To Decide Question For Itself, However 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 11 (UP). —
Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt told the
American Youth Congress tonight
that she sympathizes with Finland
as she would with any other small
nation attacked by a larger one but
didn't believe the AYC should pass
a resolution condemning the Russian
invasion unless it wanted to.
Mrs. Roosevelt, who has attended
all sessions of the institute since it
opened Friday night, has defended
the congress on several occasions
when it has been criticized, partic
ularly by the Dies Committee.
Her statement was made in re
sponse to a question handed her by
one of her relatives, Archie D.
Roosevelt—grandson of former Pres
ident Theodore Roosevelt—who rep
resented the League of Decency in
Advertising.
QUESTION OF SYMPATHY
His question repeated President
Roosevelt's assertion of Saturday in
a speech to the Youth Congress that
98 per cent of the American people
sympathize with Finland in its ef
forts to stave of! the Russian inva
sion and asked if Mrs. Roosevelt
didn't agree that the Youth Con
gress should express such sympathy.
Mrs. Roosevelt, under questioning,
agreed that the stand for democracy
should have been taken in the Ital
ian-Ethiopian war, then added:
"I also agree with your sympathy
for Spain, China and Czechoslovakia,
but I also have sympathy for Fin
land."
FINNS DEMOCRATIC
Mrs. Roosevelt told the approxi
mately 3500 delegates that she re
alized some young people felt the
Finnish government had "certain
fascist tendencies" but declared that
the present government is "what the
people want it to be or the whole
people wouldn't be making the fight
they are."
Mrs. Roosevelt spoke after Jose
Perez, president of the Brotherhood
of Cuban Youth, had attacked the
President's "good neighbor" policy,
contending that changes in its fun
damental principles during recent
months had endangered the neutral
ity of the Western Hemisphere na
tions.
Perez said that "reactionary
groups" in Cuba who previously op
posed the policy because it offered
possibility of establishing democratic
governments in Latin American and
opposition to the spread of fascism
now were "happy because they feel
sure that America is going to enter
the war and they see the chance of
making huge profits."
F. Stephen McArthur, president of
the Kearny (N.J.) Young Demo
crats Club, was ejected from the
Citizenship Institute of the Congress
when he attempted to introduce a
resolution calling for expulsion of
the Young Communist League and
its "red front groups" from the
youth organization.

sion and asked if Mrs. Roosevelt
didn't agree that the Youth Con
gress should express such sympathy.
Mrs. Roosevelt, under questioning,
agreed that the stand for democracy
should have been taken in the Ital
ian-Ethiopian war, then added:
"I also agree with your sympathy
for Spain, China and Czechoslovakia,
but I also have sympathy for Fin
land."
FINNS DEMOCRATIC
Mrs. Roosevelt told the approxi
mately 3500 delegates that she re
alized some young people felt the
Finnish government had "certain
fascist tendencies" but declared that
the present government is "what the
people want it to be or the whole
people wouldn't be making the fight
they are."
Mrs. Roosevelt spoke after Jose
Perez, president of the Brotherhood
of Cuban Youth, had attacked the
President's "good neighbor" policy,
contending that changes in its fun
damental principles during recent
months had endangered the neutral
ity of the Western Hemisphere na
tions.
Perez said that "reactionary
groups" in Cuba who previously op
posed the policy because it offered
possibility of establishing democratic
governments in Latin American and
opposition to the spread of fascism
now were "happy because they feel
sure that America is going to enter
the war and they see the chance of
making huge profits."
