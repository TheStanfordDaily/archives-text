SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 11 (UP).â€”
A frightened little monkey infected
with infantile paralysis germs in a
laboratory experiment at University
of California Hospital eluded cap
ture today in the dense foliage of
Sutro Forest.
After escaping from his scientist
keepers at the hospital's Hooper
Foundation research laboratory, the
monkey fled to the nearby forest.
Hooper Foundation scientists said
although the monkey was infected
in an advanced stage of the disease,
with poliomyelitis germs, he was not
and probably would be too fright
ened to come sufficiently near a
uman to harm him.
