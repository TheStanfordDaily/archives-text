# Cal Free Throws Beat Cagers
## Indians Unable to Convert Charity Tosses as Bears Nip Rally for 38-36 Win Fouls Costly as Cowden, Davidson Ousted in Final Minutes; Cards Hold Second Place in Race Despite Loss 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
If (lie law of averages hadn't done our Indian cagers dirt Friday night,
there might have been a diiVerent story to tell on the campus today about
the Stanford-California basketball fracas.
As it is, everyone knows that in a thriJl-a-minute game at Berkeley,
(lie revamped Golden Bears sneaked in a knockout punch late in the
game to take a 38-36 decision

Coach Everett Dean's quintet.
The law of averages, of which we
are speaking, is about the Indians'
hard luck in finding the hoop via
the charity throw route. Given 11
chances at the foul line the Cards I
made only four of 'em good. On the j
other hand the Bears capitalized j
on 8 of 14 free throws.
BEST FROM FLOOR
However, showing the basketball |
clientele that they are still one of I
the best scoring teams from the |
field, the Indians chalked up 10 j
field goals to 15 for Cal. With any
sort of luck on those foul tosses—at
least 70 per cent should be made ;
good in any game—the Injuns might ,
have taken the Bears to the clean- j
ers by a narrow margin instead of |
losing by one bucket.
Thanks to the doughty Bruins of
U.C.L.A., the Stanfords are still in 1
the coveted second place in the
Southern Division, leading their j
arch Berkeley rivals by a game—the
game the Bruins took front Cal last |
week-end.
SHOO-IN FOR TROY
Almost a clear line of march to
the title is open now to the rough
and tough Trojans, who swamped
the Bruins, 60-26, Friday, for their
sixth straight conference victory.
Games this week pit the Indians
against what will be a tougher Bruin
team than the quintet which took a
double .shellacking in the first two
games of the season in Los Angeles.
The Trojans meanwhile have the
first of two doubly-important series |
to contend with, meeting Coach Nibs I
Price's giants across the bay.
Then Feb. 23 and 24 the Trojans
meet Stanford here. About that j
time the Indians will know if there |
is any ray of hope for them to beat j
out U.S.C. for the title.
NIP AND TUCK
From start to fiinish the Stanford- |
Cal joust had its thrills and spills, i
Never in the first half did the In- j
dians get any closer than two points j
and were behind, 20-18, at the half- j
time gun. The real fireworks took |
place when the lead changed hands j
four times and the score was dead- !
locked at least seven times in the
second half.
Stanford found its bolt just about
completely shot late in the game,
when it lost both Ken Davidson and J
Bill Cowden on personals. With a |
38-32 lead, Fordy Anderson per- j
sonally took charge of a belated '
rally to bring the score to its final !
figu re.
The Indians found a stronger j
Bear club than the team which lost, j
55-32, three weeks ago. The moving
of BiggerstafT to forward, addition j
of Ray Tamm, a soph, at the other
forward, and Irv Hodes at guard !
greatly increased the scoring poten- !
tialities of the Bears.
LAFAILLE SHINES
The Indians had the services of
Anderson to start the game, but
found that they couldn't have gone j
far without Leon Lafaille as the lat
ter tanked five field goals and made
the second half interesting from the
Stanford point of view with his long
goals which didn't even touch the
rim.
Again the biggest Bear behemoth,
Bill Ogilvie, was smothered. His i
captors were Dick Taylor and Bob j
Penn, who played fine defensive j
ball. Don Williams shared the Stan
ford scoring with 10 points.
