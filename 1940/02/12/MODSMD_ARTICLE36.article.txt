# Papoose Five Ekes Out 35-34 Win Over Cubs
## Cardinal Yearlings Trim Galileo, 41-25; Stay in Win Column 
### 
In a game that had the spectators
on their feet for the last three ac
tion-filled minutes of play, Stan
ford's high-riding frosh cagers cop
ped the first game of their annual
three-game series with the Cal
Frosh by a 35-34 score at Berkeley
Friday night.
They kept up their work in the
win column Saturday night by tak
ing Galileo High School down the
line by a 41-25 count. In this game
the second team played most of the
game for Stanford, with the first
outfit going in only long enough to
run up an 18-point lead.
CARDS TRAIL
The Cal frosh game was just as
close as the score indicates for, al
though the Card yearlings were on
the short end of the count during
most of the game, there were never
more than five points separating the
two teams and most of the time only
one or two points.
Going into the last 10 minutes of
play on the short end of a 25-23
count, the Stanford frosh really went
to work in earnest, taking a sliver
sizec! lead that they refused to re
linquish for the remainder of the
game. Their never-say-die attitude
which characterized this late-game
drive was the outstanding factor in
their victory, according to Beeb Lee,
freshman basketball mentor.
LINARI STARS
After Stanford went into a 27-25
lead on buckets by Leo McCaffrey
and Walt Funabiki, diminutive Fred
Linari hit for three baskets in a
row and followed with two free
throws to run the Papoose total to
34 and a five-point margin.
The frosh went into the contest as
tight as a drum and didn't loosen
up until well into the game, which
accounts for their erartic passing, ac
cording to Lee. Ed Stamm was high
scorer with 10 points.
YEARLINGS AHEAD
The victory gave the Card year
lings the first leg of the Cal series,
and promised them a better-than
even chance of copping the series.
Fol* most of the game Saturday
night's contest against Galileo High
was even-stephen, but when the first

game, the frosh moved away from
their opponents in speedy fashion.

though the Card yearlings were on
the short end of the count during
most of the game, there were never
more than five points separating the
two teams and most of the time only
one or two points.
Going into the last 10 minutes of
play on the short end of a 25-23
count, the Stanford frosh really went
to work in earnest, taking a sliver
sizec! lead that they refused to re
linquish for the remainder of the
game. Their never-say-die attitude
which characterized this late-game
drive was the outstanding factor in
their victory, according to Beeb Lee,
freshman basketball mentor.
LINARI STARS
After Stanford went into a 27-25
lead on buckets by Leo McCaffrey
and Walt Funabiki, diminutive Fred
Linari hit for three baskets in a
row and followed with two free
throws to run the Papoose total to
34 and a five-point margin.
The frosh went into the contest as
tight as a drum and didn't loosen
up until well into the game, which
accounts for their erartic passing, ac
cording to Lee. Ed Stamm was high
scorer with 10 points.
YEARLINGS AHEAD
The victory gave the Card year
lings the first leg of the Cal series,
and promised them a better-than
even chance of copping the series.
