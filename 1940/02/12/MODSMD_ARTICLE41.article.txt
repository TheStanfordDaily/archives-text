# Freshman Nine Drops Opener
## Frosh Defense Fails As Balboa Wins. 11-6 
### 
Tough breaks and nervous fielding
I caused the Stanford freshmen to
, drop their season baseball opener to
Balboa High School 11-6 last Fri
day afternoon here. The high school j
j club from San Francisco took ad- j
i vantage of four frosh errors and
never relinquished the lead after the
| third, inning.
Tomorrow at 3:30 o'clock on the
frosh diamond St. Ignatius High
| School of San Francisco will play, j
i with either "Tex" Rickard or Marvin j
i Harmes pitching for the Papooses, j
Phil Wolf will probably hurl Friday j
against Commerce High, also from ;
| the city.
j Friday's tilt was marked by sloppy ,
I fielding, which showed the frosh's j
lack of infield practice the previous j
week due to the rains. Catcher Bill j
(Ace) Hanlon showed up well be- i
hind the plate and KeUenberger in
left handled his post well.
Coach Harry Shipkey was heart- '
1 ened by the hitting of Carl Kellen- j
| berger, who smashed a double and !
triple in three trips, and of Pitcher I
I Wo It and Thirdsacker Ted Falasco, j
i who each garnered a two-baser and j
1 single in four appearances. Short- ;
| stop Clarke Graham and Catcher!
I Oscar Holmes also rammed long I
doubles.
The score:
It II E
Balboa 30 3 01 2 2—ll !) 2
' Stanford .... 30 I 01 0 1— (i !) I
Batteries: Adams, Frascheri, and
1 Jordan Wolf and Hanlon, Holmes.
