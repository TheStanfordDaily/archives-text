# Farm Rugby Team Ties Troy, 0-0
## Cards Control First Half of Saturday's See-Saw Encounter 
### 
Stanford ruggers won nothing and
lost nothing in their first intercol
legiate game of the 1940 season,
when they tied U.S.C., 0-0, in the
Stanford Stadium Saturday.
Although the Cards had the ex
perience of one game under their
belts, they were apparently out
conditioned by the Trojans, who were
playing their first game. Stanford
had two scoring opportunities in the
first half, but were completely bot
tled up in the second period by the
big, hard-hitting boys from South
ern Cal.
The Stanford backs looked good
whenever they got the ball, but the
aggressive, hard-tackling S.C. for
wards prevented many Cardinal
passing rushes. The Trojans out
tackled the Farm lads throughout
most of the game.
FORWARDS LACK ALERTNESS
Kicks that failed to go out of
bounds time and again had the play
sweeping up and down the field, but
at no time was either team able to
capitalize on superior kicking ability.
After the game, Coaches Jim
Wylie, Harry Maloney, and Willard
Clausen pointed out that the Big Red
forwards lacked alertness on many
occasions, and promised that this dif
ficulty would be ironed out in heavy
practice sessions during the forth
coming week.
PUGIi EARNS PRAISE
In the Card forward rank, Ned
Pugh earned the praise of the coach
ing staff for his aggressive play.
Pete Kmetovic, Hugh Gallarneau,
and Ken McMurray looked good in
the Stanford backfield.
Captain Howard Hickingbotham
was taken from the game in the sec
ond half with a back bruise, but he
will be ready to go next week when
Stanford meets the Trojans in a re
turn game in Los Angeles.
U.S.C. presented an attack which
showed flashes of brilliance, but
wore unable to get off any sus
tained drives. However, with a little
experience, they will be a hard club
for any team to beat, and the Stan
ford coaching staff will have to do
a lot of hard work if they expect to
win next week.

Wylie, Harry Maloney, and Willard
Clausen pointed out that the Big Red
forwards lacked alertness on many
occasions, and promised that this dif
ficulty would be ironed out in heavy
practice sessions during the forth
coming week.
PUGIi EARNS PRAISE
In the Card forward rank, Ned
Pugh earned the praise of the coach
ing staff for his aggressive play.
Pete Kmetovic, Hugh Gallarneau,
and Ken McMurray looked good in
the Stanford backfield.
Captain Howard Hickingbotham
was taken from the game in the sec
ond half with a back bruise, but he
will be ready to go next week when
Stanford meets the Trojans in a re
turn game in Los Angeles.
U.S.C. presented an attack which
showed flashes of brilliance, but
wore unable to get off any sus
tained drives. However, with a little
experience, they will be a hard club
for any team to beat, and the Stan
ford coaching staff will have to do
a lot of hard work if they expect to
win next week.
Stanford ruggers won nothing and
lost nothing in their first intercol
legiate game of the 1940 season,
when they tied U.S.C., 0-0, in the
Stanford Stadium Saturday.
Although the Cards had the ex
perience of one game under their
belts, they were apparently out
conditioned by the Trojans, who were
playing their first game. Stanford
had two scoring opportunities in the
first half, but were completely bot
tled up in the second period by the
big, hard-hitting boys from South
ern Cal.
The Stanford backs looked good
whenever they got the ball, but the
aggressive, hard-tackling S.C. for
wards prevented many Cardinal
passing rushes. The Trojans out
tackled the Farm lads throughout
most of the game.
FORWARDS LACK ALERTNESS
Kicks that failed to go out of
bounds time and again had the play
sweeping up and down the field, but
at no time was either team able to
capitalize on superior kicking ability.
After the game, Coaches Jim
Wylie, Harry Maloney, and Willard
Clausen pointed out that the Big Red
forwards lacked alertness on many
occasions, and promised that this dif
ficulty would be ironed out in heavy
practice sessions during the forth
coming week.
