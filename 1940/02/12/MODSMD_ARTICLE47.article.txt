# Heaven on Earth

### 
WAITING for the trains to pass when the
safety gates were down before work
started on the underpass was extremely irritat
ing to the speed-crazed twentieth century mind.
Undoubtedly it was an enormous waste of time.
Almost equally annoying is waiting for the
Palm Drive stop signal to change before one can
proceed into Palo Alto or onto the highway. It
is merely a cause for fidgeting —until 11:30
o'clock when it is turned off. Then it turns the
intersection of Palm Drive and El Camino Real
into a potential death trap.
Originally plans were made to remedy both
of these situations by building two underpasses,
one running University Avenue beneath the
railroad tracks and the other sinking the high
way beneath the Stanford-Palo Alto artery.
Because the federal government is waging a
campaign to get rid of railway crossings, it
was willing to finance the sub-Southern Pacific
underpass. But the responsibility for the other
one was left to the City of Palo Alto and the
State Highway Commission.
Thus the construction of one of the projects
is now well under way, and the fate of the other
lies limp in official hands, hands which seem to
want to postpone it for at least two more years.
The excuse offered is not unusual—insufficient
funds.
However, because Palo Alto has expressed its
willingness to pay half the costs, because Stan
ford University has offered to donate the neces
sary four or five acres of land, because approxi
mately $35,000 can be saved by building both
underpasses at the same time, the sensible thing
is to build it now, *
Dirt scooped out for one project can be used
to fill in the other, the connection between the
two can be constructed much more economi
cally, and, perhaps most important of all, build
ing them simultaneously will shorten by six
months the period during which University Ave
nue must be closed.
For the sake of efficiency, economy, and the
convenience of the motoring public, the Palm
Drive underpass should be started at once.
We had better not let the state officials know
about it, but it will put Heaven on earth for
Stanford drivers too.

underpass. But the responsibility for the other
one was left to the City of Palo Alto and the
State Highway Commission.
Thus the construction of one of the projects
is now well under way, and the fate of the other
lies limp in official hands, hands which seem to
want to postpone it for at least two more years.
The excuse offered is not unusual—insufficient
funds.
However, because Palo Alto has expressed its
willingness to pay half the costs, because Stan
ford University has offered to donate the neces
sary four or five acres of land, because approxi
mately $35,000 can be saved by building both
underpasses at the same time, the sensible thing
is to build it now, *
Dirt scooped out for one project can be used
to fill in the other, the connection between the
two can be constructed much more economi
cally, and, perhaps most important of all, build
ing them simultaneously will shorten by six
months the period during which University Ave
nue must be closed.
For the sake of efficiency, economy, and the
convenience of the motoring public, the Palm
Drive underpass should be started at once.
We had better not let the state officials know
about it, but it will put Heaven on earth for
Stanford drivers too.
WAITING for the trains to pass when the
safety gates were down before work
started on the underpass was extremely irritat
ing to the speed-crazed twentieth century mind.
Undoubtedly it was an enormous waste of time.
Almost equally annoying is waiting for the
Palm Drive stop signal to change before one can
proceed into Palo Alto or onto the highway. It
is merely a cause for fidgeting —until 11:30
o'clock when it is turned off. Then it turns the
intersection of Palm Drive and El Camino Real
into a potential death trap.
Originally plans were made to remedy both
of these situations by building two underpasses,
one running University Avenue beneath the
railroad tracks and the other sinking the high
way beneath the Stanford-Palo Alto artery.
Because the federal government is waging a
campaign to get rid of railway crossings, it
was willing to finance the sub-Southern Pacific
underpass. But the responsibility for the other
one was left to the City of Palo Alto and the
State Highway Commission.
