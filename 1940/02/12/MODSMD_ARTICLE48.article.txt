DURING last January's noisy storm over the
selection of a football coach and in the trail
of the recent appointment of a new track mentor,
certain dissatisfied students often accused their
representatives on the Board of Athletic Control
of being under the thumbs of the alumni and
faculty members.
Actually no scrap of evidence exists to justify
this conclusion. But it is true that the two elected
student members were scholarship athletes and
physical education majors.
It is also true that it is possible for the alumni
to bring pressure to bear on any athlete who is
here on a scholarship and for men on the phys
ical education faculty to influence students who
will need their recommendations in order to get
jobs when they have finished school.
There has been no trouble in this direction
as yet, but unquestionably a definite danger
exists.
In the face of these facts, last week Hall and
Row politicians still saw fit to nominate four
athletes, all of them in all probability on schol
arships or receiving unofficial alumni aid, for
the position of B.A.C. representative.
All of them are not physical education majors.
However, each of the candidates has a thor
ough knowledge of the Stanford athletic set-up.
Each is a member of the varsity in a major sport,
and at least one of them has had actual expe
rience working with the Board.
The politically lethargic Stanford student
body is going into tomorrow's election with its
eyes open. From a potential field of approxi
mately 3,000 men it has allowed four scholar
ship athletes to be nominated.
If a major controversy arises on the B.A.C.

during the next year, the students will have no
right to complain that their representatives are
stooges lor the alumni and the faculty members.
They will have only themselves to blame
for being tools in the hands of their own poli
ticians.
