### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
THE WRONG HONORABLE DUFF
IIIOST of us who heard Duff Cooper Thursday night
are agreed on one thing: The Right Honorable
Duff is a smooth number—lots of audience appeal and
a polished speaker. He knew the psychology of his
listeners, but a few of his listeners, I think, knew
his psychology too.
We all feel reasonably sure that Hitler is just a
little unreliable, and most of us have a sneaking sus
picion that Finland is a good bit smaller than Russia.
Cooper knew he could use these obvious facts for
sympathy, and he counted on their emotional value to
sarry us to his dubious citadel of very British con
clusions.
Yes, most of the basic facts were correct: Hitler is a
liar. Compared to some treaties in history the Ver
sailles affair was Christian mercy. And Finland has
a population of four million while the Russian census
registers over 100 million.
There were some things passed off as facts, of
course, which are at variance with the opinions of
reporters like John Gunther: Poland, for example, was
not a "happy, prosperous nation" as Cooper told us.
Large portions of its population, as a matter of fact,
were starving. But it is undoubtedly true that the
Poles would rather have starved without the added
torment of war and conquest. At any rate it wasn't
the incorrect information that bothered us so much.
It was mainly the far-flung conclusions and the things
that were left unmentioned.

talked as though Britain had dealt Ger-
J many a royal flush at Versailles, and that now the
ingrates are simply biting the hand that fed them. Re
gardless of how the Versailles Treaty is apologized
into a legal halo, the fact remains that Hitler rose to
power on the economic misery of Germany. Naziism
could never have enslaved the German people, who are
really very much like us and the English and not
'"teutonic barbarians" at all, had it not been, for the
poverty in Germany that made for dissatisfaction.
And it would be fatuous to deny that Germany's
poverty was in part a result of the economic domina
tion of Europe by England and France—Versailles
Treaty or no Versailles Treaty. Now it may be per
fectly true that no peace in Europe can be achieved
while ruthless, megalomanic Hitlers are commanders
of war machines. But it is equally true that no last
ing peace will prevail in Europe if England and France
plan to make peace by fortifying their economic dom
ination of Europe and by intensifying the mad strug
gles of economic nationalisms.
And sadly enough it is a little difficult to see how a
progressive, humanitarian peace can be brought about
when civilized Englishmen are again comparing the
Germans to the "barbarian hordes that swept down
upon the Roman Empire."
For what are the Allies fighting—peace or the Brit
ish pound?
