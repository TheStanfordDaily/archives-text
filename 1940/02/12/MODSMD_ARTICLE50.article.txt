# CAMPUS OPINION
## DUFF COOPER HAD A HEEL 
### 
r IMIE EDITOR, SIR:
The Right Honorable Alfred Duff Cooper per
formed efficiently with respect to his known purpose,
which was to swing as much sympathy as possible.
In my own mind, however, there are not a few gaps
and inconsistencies left by his speech, which I should
be interested to hear an Anglophile fill or reconcile. . . .
He picked out as one of the greatest goods that
came out of that Epitome of Sweet Reasonableness,
the Peace Conference, mankind's new hatred and hor
ror of war. A moment later this inestimable good had
become the chief defect of recent British foreign pol
icy. Is it possible, then, that the traditional demands
and forms of British diplomacy are in conflict with the
best welfare of mankind?
In order to demonstrate his democratic sentiments,
DufT Cooper emphasized that a government is not the
absolute master of a people's interests and ideals, but
a mere "trustee." Consequently, he said, a govern
ment cannot sacrifice what does not belong to it, and
the sort of sacrifice that is moral in an individual is
highly immoral in a government.
s»« $ * >i«.
B UT to nie these very words mean that a govern
ment can not only sacrifice what does not belong
to it—life—but can in the first place decree that it
must be lives that are sacrificed and not. something
else, such as pride. The government can even decide
which lives are to be blotted out, and how many and
by what means. Surely this is a surprising preroga
tive in a mere trustee. Incidentally, I have not heard
of the British trustees' putting the war question before
its master, the people, in the form of a referendum.
The last major paradox in DufT Cooper's speech is
palpable. How in the world are we going to establish
a just, rational, unembittered supra-national system
at the next Peace, when we are already preaching that
the last Peace was "too generous"? In connection with
this point I might remark that Marshall Foch's com
plaint and his conviction that "We'll have to do it all
over again' suggest to me (hat France has spent the
intervening 20 years looking for trouble. . . .
Finally, may I add that there were many people
present who are familiar with the history of tile Peace
Conference and can point to specific actions of the
Allies as unjust: for example, the blockade that was
held against starving non-combatants until July, 1919,
and the war guilt clause.
Sincerely,
Willis Butler
