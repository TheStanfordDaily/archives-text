yHE EDITOR, SIR:
Last week a student asked me, "Why hasn't Stan
ford a glee club?"
Lest there are others who are ignorant of the fact,
may I publicly announce that Stanford has a glee
club; a glee club that, since September, has grown
from about eight members to its present enrollment of
more than thirty.
The organization, composed of both men and wom
en. was started last, year from the remains of the Wom
en s Glee and Men's Glee. These previous clubs have
flourished at several periods in Stanford's past.
The present Mixed Glee Club, now sufTering from
growing pains, gives promise of active, worth-while
existence in the near future. On March 13 the club
will sing a 15-minute program over KGO for the regu
lai Stanford Hour series, and plans are under way
for a Spring Concert.
If anyone doubts the existence of a Stanford Glee
Club, let him join us at rehearsals: 8 o'clock Monday
nights and 4 to 5:15 on Wednesday afternoons. Any
Stanford student is welcomed and the roll books are
never closed.
Sincerely,
Joel Carter
