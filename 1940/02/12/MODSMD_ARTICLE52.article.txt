"DESTRY RIDES AGAIN," at the Stanford.
Some of us like to think we are very much grown up. But this fact
remains to thwart our collegiate egotism: We liked Western pants
hitching pictures on Saturday afternoons when we were 12, and we still
get a kick out of shooting-hooting thrillers.

"Destry Rides Again" is nut a<
work of art nor good for a steady j
diet. But if you l'eel like cinematic \
excitement and the sentimental lift I
that only a two-gun hero can give,
then go to see Young Tom Destry I
(Jimmy Stewart) clean up "Bottle- !
neck," the rip-roar ingest sinful town j
in the West.
NO TENDERFOOT
Tom starts out as a singularly new
type of sheriff. He aims to bring !
back law and order without any 1
shooting. But don't worry. Our up- J
standing defender of the honest folks j
CAN shoot when he wants to.
"See those little sticks up there?"
drawls Tom. And he takes the out
law's six-shooter and knocks every
one of the sticks down at a hundred
feet. "Nice toys when you know
how to use them," he adds signifi
cantly as he hands back the gun and
hitches his pants.
AUEIt, MERKEL SCORE
Charles Winninger, as usual,
makes a sympothy-getting, good
hearted drunk whose honest back is
plugged by the cowardly bad men.
That's enough to rouse the fighting j
blood that Destry inherited from his i
two-gunned father. And the audi- I
ence cheers as Destry rides again, j
Yippee!
Comedy is successfully supplied
by Mischa Auer, who "vonts to be
a cossack," and by Una Merkel, who
looks aptly ridiculous and indignant
in her ample petticoats after she
loses a dress in a free-for-all with
"Frenchy."
RIDE 'EM, COWBOY
Unlike most Westerns the sheriff
doesn't start out with guns and a i
fast right uppercut. Tom Destry just j
whittles a hunk of wood and tells j
little anecdotes about "a friend of i
mine." But that gives you plenty of 1
time to get really mad at the kid- j
killing, widow-robbing, card-cheat
ing band of thieves. And things I
really start happening when Destry |
takes his pistols off the wall.
Yes sir! Bottleneck cheers and I
you will scream when "Destry Rides |
Again."â€”Mellinkoff
