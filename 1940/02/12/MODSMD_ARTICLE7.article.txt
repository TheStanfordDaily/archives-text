GOOD ATTENDANCE
There are three more talks to be i
given this quarter under the direc
tion of the men's vocational guid- I
ance committee and the office of the j
dean of men, and the discussion to- |
night is the fourth of the talks on j
the subject of business and finance,
he added.
Concerning the response of the
students to the series, Mr. Sharp I
said that talks so far had been i
"well attended."
FRESHMEN PREDOMINATE
"Of course there are more fresh- i
men coming, since the meetings are i
held in the Encina lobby," he re
marked, "but I think it is safe to |
say that the number of students j
present at the talks that concern I
their chosen fields is very good."
"Many people have asked me why
Monday night was chosen for these
vocational talks," he continued. "It's
simple: Tuesday night is lecture se
ries, Wednesday pledges go to the
Row, Thursday they study for econ
and other exes, and Friday's not
such a good night for a business
forum."
