# Duff Coopers Left in Lurch At Paly Station
## 
### 
From the House of Parliament to
the Greyhound bus stationâ€”through
the courtesy of Bob Moulton and
Greyson Bryan. That's the quick
change accomplished after his lec
ture here Thursday by the Right
Honorable Alfred Duff Cooper and
his wife, the former Lady Diana
Manners.
Hurrying away from an after-lec
ture forum to catch the 10:25 o'clock
train to the city, Mr. Duff Cooper
and Lady Diana were brought, to
the Palo Alto station by Greyson
Bryan, chairman of the A.S.S.U. Lec
ture Series, and Bob Moulton as the
train was ready to leave.
With courtesy and dispatch Moul
ton put the British statesman's
steamer trunk in the baggage car.
The train started to move.
Mr. Duff Cooper jumped aboard.
Lady Diana, afraid, refused to
follow suit.
Mr. Duff Cooper jumped off.
And the trunk went to San Fran
cisco, and Moulton took the former
First Lord of the Admiralty and the
celebrated beauty to the Greyhound
bus station, where, after a wait of
10 minutes, they took the 10:39 bus
away from Palo Alto.
