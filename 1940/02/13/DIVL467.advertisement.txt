I SHE SAW A DRESS—
100 MILES AWAY!
A girl was reading her home-town newspaper, when she saw a dress
advertised by a store back home, a hundred miles away. \ lew days
later she was wearing the same dress to a danee!
Magic? No —she had simply discovered how l<> shop by news
paper!
Newspaper advertising can act as a magic carpel for you, 100. I(
can save you miles of steps, by displaying the stores" merchandise
right in your own home. Telling you the important things you would
ask about in the store itself —sizes, range of colors, labric, wash
ability, details of fashion.
The girl bought her dress with utter confidence, because the
store s advertisement had told her just what she needed to know
and she knew its printed statement could be trusted. )on can buy
with equal confidence, because the advertisement is your guarantee
that what you buy will be exactly as you saw it in the paper.
I'age through this newspaper and notice the wide selection ol
1 merchandise —the unexpected chances for saving. ou will discover
for yourself the new leisure and economy of shopping "the news
paper way!
