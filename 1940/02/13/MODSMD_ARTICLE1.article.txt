### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
HP HE "outs" were shouting at the
"ins."
While the Democrats remained
strangely silent yesterday, the Re
publicans unleashed a barrage of ar
guments across the nation, the open
ing guns in their fight to recapture
the White House in November. Doz
ens of Lincoln Day speeches charged
New Deal business and fiscal poli
cies have split the nation and threat
en its ruin.
From platforms in most of the
nation's key cities, Republican
leaders cried out against class
prejudices reputedly aroused by
New Deal measures; against the
"failure" of the government to
solve the unemployment problem:
against the skyrocketing national
debt, and against attacks on busi
ness by Administration officials.
* * *
r pHEY chorused a general plea
that the voters return the G.O.P.
to power in the interests of "na
tional unity." The curtain was tug
ged upward, revealing the 1940
battle, by nearly every standout Re
publican hopeful, including former
President Herbert Hoover. Speaking
at Omaha, Hoover submitted a 10-
point remedial program to restore
the well-being and confidence of
the country
Stanford's best known alumnus
called on the nation to stay out of
war; turn from government spend
ing to national thrift; change from
"our national drift to statisni to
making a civilization of free men";
turn away from class conflict and
inspire co-operation among men.
District Attorney Thomas E. Dew
ey of New York paused in his barn
storming tour of the Northwest long
enough to fire a blistering salute at
the New Deal from a Portland van
tage point. He charged it has adopt
ed a policy of ruling by dividing the
people on issues and said that while
this strategy may help the Admin
istration "it can only hurt the
country."

r PHE Administration's foreign poli
cies came in for a drubbing from
Rep. Hamilton Fish of New York,
another possible presidential nomi
nee, who told Illinois Republicans
that re-election of Roosevelt or elec
tion of "any New Deal internation
alist" would draw this nation into
the European war three months after
inauguration day.
Sen. 11. Styles Bridges sounded
off' down in Oklahoma, asserting
that men cannot be free if "mil
lions are dependent upon the gov
ernment for necessities of life."
Senator Wiley of Wisconsin as
sured Texas Republicans that the
"people have been fooled long
enough and their eyes are being
opened." Asserting that the pres
ent era will go down in history as
the "tinkering age" because "we
have been tinkering so much with
a lot of false but apparently at
tractive ideas," he said that Lin
coln would base his prediction of a
coming change on the fact that
people realize "business and in
dustry are being restricted by men
who are 'theory ridden'."

Senator Arthur Capper of Kansas
wasn't idle yesterday, either. He
told the Alexander Hamilton Club
of Baltimore that the United States
form of government is in immediate
danger, and said if President Roose
velt is renominated "it will be ac
cepted by the country, and should
be regarded by the country, as a plan
to overturn the American system."
The flood of anti-Administration
speeches surged in Grand Rapids,
where Gov. Arthur James of Penn
sylvania spoke; in Greensboro, N.C.,
where Senator Taft chirped at the
bogey of dictatorship; in New York,
where John D. M. Hamilton forecast
Republican victory. Lone Democrat
who ventured out on Lincoln's Day
was Sen. Burton K. Wheeler, who
defended the nation as engaged in
genuine economic and social wel
fare.
