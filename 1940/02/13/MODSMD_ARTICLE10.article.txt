son Cannon, Henry McMicking,
Hugh O'Donnell, Ed Stein, and Roy
Trowbridge.
ANDERSON STATES
Anderson stated that the new
Council will start with a perfectly
clean slate; all honor code cases have
Ijeen disposed of and the number of
parking and speeding cases is on the
decline.
He said that under his chairman
ship Men's Council would attempt
to co-operate with the students and
"maintain at all times a student atti
tude on questions of discipline."
"A student disciplinary body
should have this as its aim, and
should not strive at representing the
Administration," he continued.
APPRECIATES HELP
Outgoing Chairman Bob Putnam
as his last official word said, "I very
much appreciate the help of all those
who have made my term successful."
Yesterday's docket contained only
parking offenses, with fines of $23
collected from violators, and three
speeding charges with fines of $10.
Tliis continues the decline in speed
ing which has accompanied the
Council's new policy of banning a
student's car from the campus after
he has been apprehended for speed -
ing tlu'ee times.
