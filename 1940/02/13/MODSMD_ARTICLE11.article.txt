# Encina Announces Informal Dance
## 
### 
Encina's first dance of the school
year will be held Saturday night, in
Encina lobby from 9 to 1 o'clock, to
the music of Hal Moreno and his
orchestra.
That the dance is open to the en
tire student body is stressed by Pub
licity Chairman Bill Kroener. Price
of the bids is to be 75 cents, and the
low price is due to the fact that the
Encina Club dues are subsidizing
the dance in part, according to
Kroener.
Co-chairmen for the informal af
fair are Tiny Mosher and Bob Blake.
Moreno's orchestra is well known to
campus dancers, having played sev
eral previous engagements on the
Farm, and should prove a popular
attraction, according to the chair
men.
