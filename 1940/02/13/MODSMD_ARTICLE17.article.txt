each in charge of four aides. Under
each of the four aides will be 10
callers.

tion at the dinner will be Paul C.
Edwards, Ofi, associate editor of the
San Francisco News, and chairman
of the annual appeal committee;
Mrs. Almon E. Roth, '11; Mrs. Fred
erick H. Fowler, '08, and Mrs.
George H. Whisler, '17.
WORTHY CAUSE
Mrs. Fowler, who is the daughter

solicitation effort.
In anticipation of this year's drive,
Moulton stated last night, "The drive
is something that concerns every
Stanford graduate and undergrad
uate, and will be carried on with
this in mind. Therefore, it deserves
the support of the entire 'Stanford
'Family'."
