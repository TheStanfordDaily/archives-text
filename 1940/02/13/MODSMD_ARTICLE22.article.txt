HELSINKI. Finland, Fob. 12 (UP). —Attempts l>y the Ilecl Army to
flank hotli ends of the Manncrhcim Line last night were crushed by the
heavy lire of Finnish forts, today's war communique revealed.
The Russian strategy was an attempt to cut in on Summa from the
vicinity of Koivisto on the Gulf of Finland and Taipale on Lake Ladoga,

while a continued l'rontal attack on,
the Summa spearhead sought to
mask the move.
KI SS AIR ACTIVITY
From Kirkenes came news of in
tense Russian air activity on the Pet
s;imo front, which had been quiet
for several weeks. The activity
continued until after dark. Scores
of Russian planes were seen flying
southward. It was believed lhat
Hovaniemi, important mid-Finland
city, was the object of an air at
tack.
The Russian big guns which hud
pounded the Finnish positions all
Friday and Saturday lifted their fire
yesterday to allow new waves of
tanks and infantry to renew frontal
assaults on the Manncrheim Line.
At the same time a desperate at
tempt was made to gain a foothold
on the shore of Suomenlaahti—the
Gulf of Finland — southeast of the
Koivisto forts which have been pour
ing heavy enfillade fire into the Rus
sian columns ever since the war be
gan. Simultaneously an identical at
tempt was made on the shore of
Lake Ladoga near Taipale.
FINN BATTERIES FIRE
The Finnish Koivisto and Taipale
batteries shifted their fire to blast
the Russians of! the ice as they at
tempted to reach the shores. These
attempts, especially the effort to land
near Koivisto, apparently were in
tiie hope of attacking Summa from
another angle.
If the guns of Koivisto could be si
lenced and heavy Russian guns
moved into position between there
and Summa, 15 miles away, the stub
born Finnish forces which have re
pulsed one Russian attack after an
other for 11 days might be forced
out and backwards toward Viipuri.
As a part of the new strategy, the
Russians late yesterday reopened for
the first time in many days the long
range artillery bombardment of Vii
puri. Two series of 20 shells each
were hurled into the port city, now
almost deserted. An aid raid fol
lowed the artillery bombardment.
