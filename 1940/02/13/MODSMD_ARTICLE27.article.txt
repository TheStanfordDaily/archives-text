Stanford too has its four muske
teers—the Lagunita Lovers, who are
more commonly known as the Boat
house Boys.
"And we've got about as much
privacy as that goldfish," laughed
Fred Seebach, one of the quartet.
"Our front porch is glassed in, our
second-floor bedrooms are just level
with the ground outside, and there
is always somebody running through
our basement."
ALL ARE EXPERT
Fred's three cohorts are Jack
Behr, Dave Nottago, and Hadley
Bacon, who is manager of the or
ganization. All are expert swimmers
as is evidenced by the fact that See
bach and Bacon are on the varsity
swimming team and all, with the
exception of Seebach, are members
of the waterpolo squad.
It i.s the task of these four to keep
the Boathouse open seven days a
week. In return for carrying canoes,
doling paddles and rescuing drown
ing damsels — 120 hours of hard

I work —they are given their room in
the Boathouse for three quarters.
' If the season i.s long, the four earn
I extra money as soon as they have
worked off their required 120 hours.
SEASON LOOKS LONG
"And it looks like a nice long
season," said Seebach, with a grin
j and a glance at the gurgling over
flow pipe.
And what are the Boathouse liv
ing accommodations like? There are
i two rooms with an adjoining bath
room. Furniture consists of double
decker beds, a desk and dresser
apiece, and two electric heaters to a
room. And the water in the show
ers is cold—all cold.
"Underline that word 'cold'," said
one of the four.
ALWAYS BUSY
The four are almost always busy.
In their spare moments, however,
they run around in dark glasses,
listen to swing music on the radio,
which blares continually, drink a
couple of cokes, and "help'a lot of
' other people drink their cokes." In
