# Student Aid Cuts Spring Scholarships
## Fund Slash to Result In Subsidy of Less Than Five Students 
### 
Tuition scholarships granted by
the Student Aid Commission will be
cut to the extent of "relatively few"
in number spring quarter, probably
as few as only three or four, it was
revealed yesterday by David S. Ja
cobson, assistant director of the
Stanford Fund.
Cause of the slash in funds this
year is the loss of $8,500 from pre
viously available sources, namely
$5,000 from the Board of Athletic
Control and $3,500 from the Book
store.
COURSE APPARENT
"If neither the appropriation from
the 8.A.C." or from the Bookstore
is available next year it is apparent
the Student Aid Commission at the
best can grant only about one-third
the scholarships it has granted in the
past," Mr. Jacobson stated.
Cancellation of contributions from
the BA.C. has been caused by re
cent Coast Conference rulings; thasc
funds amounted to $5,000 in the
years 1937-38 and 1938-39.
In the same years the Bookstores
contributed $6,000 from its profits;
but subsequently cut advances to
Student Aid to $2,500 for the year
1939-40. Other contributions each
year amounted to $4,000. Thus, in
each of the two preceding years a
total of $15,000 was received, while
only $6,500 was i-eceived this year,
causing the slash in funds for spring
quarter.
PROSPECTS CITED
As to the prospects for more ex
tensive contributions to Student Aid
next year, Mr. Karl Cowdery, asso
ciate registrar, stated, "If there is
real student support for the sug
gestion in The Daily that Bookstore
profits be assigned to Student Aid
next year, the funds and available
scholarships will be materially in
creased."
Mr. Cowdery pointed out that a
possible source of revenue in June
would be the granting of unclaimed
Bookstore rebates to Student Aid,
as indicated recently by Professor D.
E. Faville, head of the Bookstore
board.
FAVILLE URGES
Professor Faville recently stated
that if student opinion favored the
granting of Bookstore profits to Stu
dent Aid rather than in the form of
rebates, the Bookstore board would
be glad to consider the plan at its
meeting in September.
Bill Leckie, chairman of the elec
tion board, yesterday stated that
"there is no reason why such a
proposition can't be put on the bal
lot in the May elections" to evidence
student opinion.
Leckie plans to present the matter
to Ex Committee for approval in
order to have the proposal listed on
the ballot in the elections on the
third Tuesday in May.
FUNDS NOT AVAILABLE
Mr. Jacobson stated that funds
not available this year include BA.C.
contributions, amounting to $5,000,
which would make possible 50 schol
arships; that $3,500 from the Book
store will not be forthcoming, and
that 60 scholarships made possible by
the A.S.S.U., alumni, and friends
will be the only ones that can be
counted on as in the past. In the
past approximately 145 scholarships
were granted.
He said that $100 each to 30 stu
dents was granted autumn quarter,
and that 24 $100 and 12 $50 scholar
ships were granted winter quarter.
The 24 $100 scholarships included
the Mrs. Anna Holman Memorial
Scholarship and the Grace Torrey
Scholarship, each $100.
Mr. Cowdery said that students
interested in applications for spring
quarter scholarships from the Stu
dent Aid Commission should fill out
and turn in their applications by
March 1. Blanks may be obtained at
the Administration Building infor
mation window.
