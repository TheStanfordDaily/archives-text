# Ucla Star Holds Cage Score Lead
## Vaughn Cuts Goal Margin Of Robinson Don Williams jumps To Third Position In Loop Basket Race 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Attempts by U.S.C. to muffle
Jackie Robinson and by U.C.L.A.
to stop Ralph Vaughn didn't work
out as the rival camps bad fig
ured it last week.
- So today the Bruins' one-man
scoring machine, Robinson, still
maintains his lead over Vaughn, al
though it was cut to a mere seven
points.
Robinson, whom the Stanford In
dians will have to halt in this
week-end's games in Los Angeles,
has run up 85 points to Vaughn's
78 in six Southern Division confer
ence games. Robinson has 32 field
goals to 29 for Vaughn. That's an
average of 14 points per game for
Robinson.
COWDEN OUSTED
Don Williams of Stanford, who
was fourth last week,, is back in
third with 64 points, one ahead of
Walt Bickerton of California who
has 03. Bickerton came up from fifth
place as a result of his 13 points
against the Cards last week.
Co-Capt. Ken Davidson is the
only other Stanford man to make the
"Big Ten" in scoring, as Bill Cow
den was ousted from the top flight.
Davidson has 52 points for seventh
behind Dale Sears and Jack Lippert
of U.S.C. with 60 and 54 points.
FA FAILLE CONTENDS
However, Leon LaFaille is 11th
with 39 points and Cowden is in 12th
place with 32 points. Although Wil
liams has 28 field goals he has the
least foul throws to his credit of any
of the top five scorers. With some
fancy shooting against the Bruins,
he may be able to work his total up
to second place.
Southern California increased its
team offensive total over Stanford
by scoring (50 points against the
Bruins. They now have 319 to the
Cards' 268 digits. The Trojans and
Stanford are also first and second in
defensive strength with 228 and 248
points scored against them. The av
erage Trojan score is 53-38; Stan
ford's, 45-41.
INDIANS (JO SOUTH
Games this week send the Indians
South Thursday night to meet a
"newly found" Bruin team, and
Southern California meets a tall
California outfit in Berkeley. The
games in Los Angeles will determine
whether or not Stanford can mathe
matically remain in the Southern
Division title race. The Trojan-Bear
series will mean a lot to the Trojans,
who can practically cinch the title
with a double victory.
The Indian had a light workout
yesterday afternon. A heavier
schedule is called for this afternoon
and tomorrow by Coach Everett
Dean.
