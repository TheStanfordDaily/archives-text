### JERRY MAYER 
j OPEN LETTER TO
EX COMMITTEE:
On a Tuesday night more than 14
years ago—the exact date was Nov.
24, 1925—Stanford's student Exec
utive Committee voted that the foot
ball jersey worn by the great Ernie
Nevers was never to be used again.
. Since that time (here has never
1 been a Number 1 on Stanford foot
ball teams, just like the Univer
| sity of Illinois has never had a 77
i since the days of the immortal
j "Red" Grange.
But the time has come, after 14
I years, for Stanford to lay aside an
j other number that brought all-time,
j all-American fame to the Farm. As
| long as people discuss basketball
! players, Angelo Henry Luisctti's
i name will always be mentioned,
! along with that of Nat Holman, who
I starred for C.C.N.Y. and the famous
j professional Celtics.
Luisetti and his Number 7 brought
j fame to Stanford that three Vow
j Boys' Rose Bowl football teams could
| not equal. His name and number
I are synonymous with perfection of
ability and sportsmanship. His rec-
I ord of 52 points scored in a single
| game against Duquesne may never
I be equaled in a major college game.
The time has come when a bas
j ketball jersey with number 7 on it
should take its place in Stanford's
i trcf by room beside a football shirt
that bears the single numeral 1.
Luisetti and Nevers, superb per
j fection. Stanford's all-time All
| Americans.

CREW MEN STILL
QUIETLY WORKING
When the oO Stanford Crew Club
members, who are currently work
j ing on the framework of a training
j scow in the Memorial Theater work
-1 shop, finally launch their boat near
1 the end of this month, one of the
most commendable attempts to in
augurate an activity in Stanford his
tory will be well on its way to ac
complishment.
Two lower division students, Ted
Cole, a sophomore transfer, and
. Lee Peake. a freshman, have been

the guiding lights behind the drive
for Stanford lo put a crew on (lie
water after almost a 20-year
lapse.
These two students contacted
other schools on the Coast for help
and advice. Coach Ky Ebright at
Cal has donated a shell.
The Redwood City Recreation
Committee passed a recommendation
that a swimming float be built in
the Redwood Harbor that will be
equally adequate for both the Stan
lord crew and persons swimming for
pleasure. The Redwood City Port
Commission has promised that land
will be given Stanford to build a
boathouse and shower rooms, al
though the actual building would
have to be done by the Crew Club
members themselves. Oregon State
had to face the same problem before
it had a boathouse, but the Beaver
crew enthusiasts hove to and built
their own locker and shower rooms
just as the Indians will have to do.
A usual training scow costs in
the neighborhood of $(>OO. hut by
doing their own labor the local
embryo crewmen are cutting the
cost down to less than $200. which
money lias been collected from
dues contributed by the members.
Stanford's Crew Club is on its
way to success, sparked by 30 stu
dents who may well go down in Farm
history as defiant organizers who re
fused to take "no" for an answer
and surmounted all discouragements
to success.
Why don't we all get on the band
wagon?

j OPEN LETTER TO
EX COMMITTEE:
On a Tuesday night more than 14
years ago—the exact date was Nov.
24, 1925—Stanford's student Exec
utive Committee voted that the foot
ball jersey worn by the great Ernie
Nevers was never to be used again.
. Since that time (here has never
1 been a Number 1 on Stanford foot
ball teams, just like the Univer
| sity of Illinois has never had a 77
i since the days of the immortal
j "Red" Grange.
But the time has come, after 14
I years, for Stanford to lay aside an
j other number that brought all-time,
j all-American fame to the Farm. As
| long as people discuss basketball
! players, Angelo Henry Luisctti's
i name will always be mentioned,
! along with that of Nat Holman, who
I starred for C.C.N.Y. and the famous
j professional Celtics.
Luisetti and his Number 7 brought
j fame to Stanford that three Vow
j Boys' Rose Bowl football teams could
| not equal. His name and number
I are synonymous with perfection of
ability and sportsmanship. His rec-
I ord of 52 points scored in a single
| game against Duquesne may never
I be equaled in a major college game.
The time has come when a bas
j ketball jersey with number 7 on it
should take its place in Stanford's
i trcf by room beside a football shirt
that bears the single numeral 1.
Luisetti and Nevers, superb per
j fection. Stanford's all-time All

The Redwood City Recreation

that a swimming float be built in
the Redwood Harbor that will be
equally adequate for both the Stan
