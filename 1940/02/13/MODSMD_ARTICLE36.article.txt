# Frosh Baseballers Play Host To Strong S.F. Team Today
## Bill Harms will Hurl for Papooses Against Powerful St. Ignatius Nine 
### 
I Stanford's freshman baseball learn will go after their first victory of
the year today when thev clash with the perennially strong St. Ignatius
High School team of San Francisco today at 3:30 on the frosh diamond.
To plug a defensive weakness that developed in last Friday's season
j opener against Balboa High. Coach Harry Shipkey experimented yester-

i day in practice with Bill Cunha and,
! Tommy Howard in right field. Cun-
I ha and Howard will probably also
handle second base duties today.
Hurling for the lrosh nine today
J will be Bill Harms. Phil Wolf, who
dropped Friday's Balboa tilt, 11-6,
! will probably rest until next Friday,
when the frosh are hosts to Com
i merce High School, also of San
Francisco. Waiting to relieve Harms
! in event of possible emergency will
J be Brent Rickard.
j St. Ignatius has always been a
I power among city high school dia
j mond teams and their ace pitcher is
j good enough to hurl for the Kenealy
S All-Stars. He pitched for the
j Kenealys yesterday against the Farm
| varsity, however, and probably won't
be available for mound work today.
