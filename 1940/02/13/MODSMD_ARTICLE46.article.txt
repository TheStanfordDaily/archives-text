# Slip the Ballot to Me
## 
### 
TODAY less than half of the student body
will exercise its constitutional franchise in
the winter elections.
The Hall vote will be smaller than it generally
is in spring chiefly because the A.S.S.U. presi
dency is not at stake, and the Row will neglect
the polls because the houses do not fine their
members for not voting in this election.
However, if, in addition to the usual 1500 or
fewer voters, everyone who has any kind of
personal interest in the actions of the successful
candidates will cast a ballot today, the total
number of votes will be considerably higher.
If every man who has appeared before Men s
Council to pay a traffic fine will express his pref
erence regarding the new members:
If every woman who has been brought to the
bar of Women's Council for too many lockouts
will vote on the future members of that body:
If everyone who has disapproved of the ac
tions taken by the BA.C. will cast a ballot for
the new student member:
If every person who has cursed the yell lead
ers from the stands for giving the wrong yell
at the wrong time will pick his men in today's
election:
If everyone who has disagreed with the poli
cies of Ex Committee will express his choice for
the new graduate member, the new junior man,
and the new sophomore woman:
Today's election actually might turn out to
be truly representative of the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University after all.
