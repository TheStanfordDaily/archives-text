AS the nation's legislators gather in clubby
groups in Washington to mull over the
national budget, grimly deciding that the United
States must this year spend more money on
armaments than in any previous year, the di
minutive appropriation lor the National Youth
Administration is almost hidden in the midst of
astronomical figures.
Since this year the nation must economize,
yet somehow build battleships, Congress has
threatened to slash NYA funds by $15,000,000.
That that diminutive sum could actually make
the national debt look smaller is ridiculous. The
NYA cut is merely a sop to the budgeters' con
sciences.
The A.S.U. at a recent national convention
aptly stated the real aspect of this situation when
it said, "We condemn any sacrifice of vital social
objectives, such as the administration's proposal
for a slashing reduction in funds for social legis
lation, with an additional two billion dollar out
lay for arms."
The $15,000,000 would, if it were not cut, aid
40,000 college students, 100,000 high school
students, and 25,000 young people who are not
in school. It is also less than half the price of
a decent battleship. That such a substantial
amount of education should be sacrificed for
such an unsubstantial amount of national de
fense seems fantastic.
If the cut is made, 100 of 400 stu
dents on NYA may be expected to lose their
support. That the money denied those 100 stu
dents would not provide enough guns to defend
the Hoover War Library is ironically humorous.
But, humorous or fantastic, the proposed
315,000,000 cut raises a potent question. Does
this trend from textbooks to bayonets signify
-the fate of America?—J. B.
