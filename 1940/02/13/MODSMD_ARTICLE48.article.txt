# Cash Crisis
## 
### 
THAT only three or four Student Aid schol
arships will be available next quarter instead
of the usual 30 vividly illustrates the fact that
the Student Aid Commission is facing a crisis.
In all probability next year scholarship funds
will be reduced to a mere one-third of their
present total, and the prospects for future years
will be even blacker, unless something is done
to remedy the situation.
The reason for the shortage of funds lies in
the fact that the two main sources of Student Aid
income have been shut off. The Atherton purity
purge has denied the B.A.C. the privilege of
donating money that might possibly go toward
athletic scholarships, and the Bookstore now
turns over its profits in the form of rebates to its
customers to avoid having to pay corporation
taxes.
Only the gifts of the A.S.S.U., alumni, .and
friends of the University remain to support the
hamstrung Student Aid. Although this income
probably will not be discontinued, it is scarcely
enough to keep the Commission going.
When Mr. Atherton rules that B.A.C. dona
tions are outlawed, they definitely are out of
the question. Thus, it appears that the sole ray
of hope on the dark horizon is a scheme where
by the Bookstore still can work on a co-operative
basis and at the same time turn over its profits
to Student Aid.

According to the directors of the Bookstore,
such a system would be feasible if the students
were in favor of it. Already a move is under
way to sound their sentiments on the ballot in
the next spring elections.
It seems as if keeping 30 worth-while people
in Stanford is just a little bit more important than
getting a 50-cent rebate from the Bookstore after
finishing one's last final in June. It is up to the
, student body to save Student Aid.
