# BULL SESSION

### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
THE DISPOSSESSED
r | I HE DAILY stair is in more than its usual state of
excitement. Tomorrow afternoon staff members
will vote for a new editor, and soon the powers-that
be, the Editorial Board, will hand out promotions.
But one sad member of the staff, namely myself, will,
for length-of-serviee reasons, be unable to vote.
The obvious attitude for such a voteless member to
assume is one of amazed indignation. It is, after all,
somewhat unfashionable to be a disenfranehized male
in the Western Hemisphere. And the tempting shout
ing and tumult seems a little beyond my reach. I can't
vote; I am not vying for a promotion.
But on second thought there are compensations. I
have decided, in fact, not to picket the polls or hire
a "goon squad" to smash the ballot box. Perhaps one
of my pre-Ape Man ancestors was the fox that jumped
at luscious grapes and decided they were sour. But I
am really enjoying an objective view at my struggling,
voting buddies.
It isn't, of course, so serious a question as "To be or
not to be." And besides, my state of not being (a
voter) is quite beyond my control. But there are ad
vantages in not having the yoke of promotion press
ing on one's life-bent shoulder blades.

r T , HE first advantage is one of undisrupted convivial
ity. No one around here actually smiles for a
purpose, but that is the traditional belief that hangs
around elections. And who wants even a traditional
fallacy despoiling the visceral pleasure of an unsus
pected smile?
The second advantage is an economic one. No po
tential promotion obviously implies no obligation to
let people bum cigarettes. And anyone at the Daily
shack who does not smoke reefers or some scented
Oriental blend must look sharp to keep his package
full. There are, of course, two sides to the tobacco
question. A vote (or two votes as the higher execu
tives have) can serve as a fair wedge in the fine art
of smoking at the expense of your fellow man and
your lungsâ€”but not at the expense of your pocketbook.
Then there is an ethereal philosophical advantage
to this disenfranchisement business. There must be,
because so many writers have written so many words
about the spiritual value of "not having." But I've
given up trying to understand that riddle of verbal
velvet. In fact, extremist that I am. I am almost in
clined to believe that many spiritual values have
more to do with a full stomach than some poets have
assumed. And by corollary, not having a full stomach
would then become just an empty stomach and not a
spiritual value at all.
But that line of reasoning is dangerous. It might
convince me that I should resent not having a vote.
So I will bite my lip and smile and rise above the
earthly fetters of the ballot box. There was a man
named Benedict Spinoza who gave up material things.
I wonder if he has a typewriter up in heaven. Move
over, Benedict. Here I come.
