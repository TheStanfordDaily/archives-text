# CAMPUS OPINION
## TRADITIONS ARE WORTHWHILE 
### 
r jpHE EDITOR, SIR:
In the few weeks or so The Daily has given quite'
a lot of space to two of the traditions of this institu
tion. These are, "smoking on the Quad" and "the
ride to Paly." The "smoking on the Quad" issue raised
very little if any controversy, but the "ride to Paly"
caused quite a furor since we received a negative
argument from a so-called "Stanford man." I do not
want to argue either way on either of these subjects,
but only want to express an opinion.
The Daily crusaded for the upholding of these tra-i
ditions for almost two weeks. This is right and fine
but it seems to me that it should be unnecessary. Tra- 1 '
dition to me has always meant something that a group
of people living together have kept close to
hearts with a pride that, is beyond description. When
it becomes necessary to use publicity to uphold a
"tradition," that "tradition" no longer exists except in
name. (
As I am only a frosh, perhaps I am just a little bit
too sentimental about such matters. I know though |
that the Stanford "traditions" are what make this
place different from any other college. If we lose this
difference we have lost our course and no amount of
publicity can bring us back. I came to Stanford partly
because of its "traditions" and I for one intend to up
hold them.
Thanks for the space.
