r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
In a recent study by Johns Hopkins University,
it was discovered that the life expectancy of the to
bacco smoker is cut short some ten years. Dr. David
Starr Jordan, warning against the habit, said, "With
the false impression of soothing the nerves, nicotine
sets them on edge, producing a condition which de
mands more, as a means of allaying the irritation it
has already caused. . . . That tobacco does mischief
to everyone that uses it is our first count against it."
Dr. William J. Mayo, one of the famous Mayo broth
ers of Rochester, said, "I do not smoke and I do not
approve of smoking. If you will notice, you will see
that the practice is going out among the ablest sur
geons, the men at the top. No surgeon can afford to
smoke."
If athletes are requested to abstain from smoking to
increase endurance, so likewise, the physical stamina
of the average person is improved by abstinence.

JJN addition to health, there are other factors to be
considered. Evtrtv day the papers carry stories of
the loss of life and property by fire caused by cig
arettes. . . . Smoking's an expensive habit, and the
money goes to enrich the magnates of the industry,
while deplorable labor conditions exist in field arid
factory.
As non-smokers seldom complain, smokers are not
generally aware of the discomfort they cause others.
A Stanford student recently remarked to her com
panion, "When I was home I had it out with my
mother. Why shouldn't I smoke when everyone else
does?" Is not "everyone else" merely the sum of in
dividuals who all should hoed Dr. Jordan's challeng
ing call to young people, "So live that your af terse If
the man you ought to be may in his time be possible
actual"?
Very truly yours,
Elsie R. Renne
