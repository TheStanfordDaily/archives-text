"THE CAT AND THE CANARY," starring Bob Hope, Paulctle God- j
dard, and Douglass Montgomery, and currently playing at the Varsity j
Theater in Palo Alto. ,
ll' one wants laughs, chills, and Bob Hope at his hest all rolled into j
one, "The Cat and the Canary" is one's best bet.

The picture concerns seven people
who have to stay in a wierd old
house for one night to fulfill the
conditions stipulated in the will of a
crazy man who was "so crooked that
when he died he had to be screwed
into ihe ground."' (Quote Bob Hope.)
Then begins a grotesque evening
interspersed with trap doors myste
riously opening, a couple of killings,
a monster in the shape of a cat who
creeps around and generally scares
the cast, the audience, and even the
usherettes in the theater.
Bob Hope is at his funniest, for a
number of reasons. First of all, he
isn't straining to get his stuff over
and, secondly, the audience becomes
so tense during the picture that any
attempt at humor provides a natural
release.
The cast is uniformly good, with
each thespian continually arousing
one's suspicions until the spectators
get a little bit silly with it all.
Incidentally, Paulette is a sweet
little dish to look at. —Mayer
