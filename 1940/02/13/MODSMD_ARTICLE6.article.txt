# Benefit to Star Excom Take-off
## Relief Program Set For Thursday Night 
### 
A musical comedy Ex Committee,
burlesquing the real executive body,
will perform a set of antics on the
stage of Memorial Hall Thursday
night—all in the interests of non
partisan relief.
The program is slated for 8 to 9
o'clock. The price of admission will
be 25 cents.
A phony President Ken Cuth
bertson will be there, trying to bring
peace among warring factions.
A fake Bob Putnam will rail
against relief "for anyone but Amer
icans."
A.S.U. BURLESQUED
An ersatz Coline Upshaw will play
the role of "a slap-happy vice-pres
ident of the associated students,"
according to advance notices of the
program.
Even the American Student Union
will be represented in the burlesque
that will be one of the highlights of
Stanford's non-partisan relief pro
gram Thursday night.
Meanwhile, the real Ex Commit
tee prepares to select, at its regular
meeting tonight, the non-partisan
committee that will divide the pro
ceeds of the entertainment among all
the distressed areas of the world.
PROGRAM BROADENED
As originally planned, the program
was to raise funds for the Finnish
Relief Fund headed by Herbert Hoo
ver. Ex Committee last week, how
ever, broadened the program so it
will benefit needy all over the world.

lief Committee, headed by Chaplain
D. Elton Trueblood, agreed to take
over the revamped program, chang
