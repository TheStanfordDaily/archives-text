### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
INTERNATIONALLY speaking, the
United States is no longer an in
fant in swaddling clothes.
The United States has come of
age. Abandoning for the first time
its practice of relying upon friendly
nations to help protect the security
of this country, America has taken
her place in the parade of adult
nations.
Adopting a policy of sclf-de
pcndcncc it has instituted a se
ries of measures recently that are
designed to make it self-sufficient
in an international sense.
One of these measures is a war
ship expansion program designed to
give the nation a navy "second to
none." Couple with this "streamlin
ing" of the regular army and na
tional guard. Then add the constant
improvement of war equipment such
as cannon, rifle, tanks, gas masks,
and ammunition. Similarly, in avia
tion, the increase in research has
made U.S. aircraft superior to that
of any other country in the world.

A N , extremely significant item is
the creation of a huge, inter
locking system of coastline and
island defense bases. Future world
developments and the whims and
fancies of future national adminis
trations and congresses may reverse
the present trend, but the prospects
of such a change in the immediate
future appear slim.
From New England to the Carib
bean and the Panama Canal,
northward again to the west coast
and Alaska, and thence far into
the Pacific, the vast network of
land, sea and aerial fortifications
is taking shape slowly and syste
matically to ring the United States,
if not the entire Western Hemi
sphere. with a formidable band of
aggression - resistant steel.
Along with the construction of
these far-flung outposts and bases,
the navy is engaged in the largest
peace-time shipbuilding program in
the nation's history and the army's
compact land forces are being trans
formed swiftly into one of the most
highly mechanized and streamlined
fighting units in the world. The
aviation arms of both services are
being expanded at an unprecedented
rate.
Aside from considerations of de
fense, the fortifications network and
the expansion of the sea, land and
air forces are calculated to lend a
firmer air of authority to the voice
of the United States in interna
tional affairs—to enable it to speak
for itself no matter what happens to
the influence of Great. Britain and
France in the affairs of Europe, Af
rica and the Far East.

IN EFFECT, it's a program de
signed to permit the United
States to bring to maturity other
elements in its character which have
lagged behind the early coming of
age of its economic power. It is an
attempt at swift, transition from
adolescence to full voting stature in
' the quarreling parliament of na
tions.

Admiral Stark, chief of U.S.
naval operations, recently told the
House Naval Affairs Committee,
"we must take into consideration"
the possibility of an Allied defeat
in Europe. He urged speedy re
habilitation of the fleet, further in
creases in authorized strength and
rapid completion of projected At
lantic and Pacific bases.
Probably the most significant de
velopment in the defense picture is
the sudden attention which has been
paid to the nation's Atlantic shore
line, and particularly the Atlantic
approach, via the Caribbean, to the
Panama Canal—the "lifeline" which
permits speedy transfer of the sea
fighting forccs from one ocean to
another.
