# Card Boatmen Produce Own Training Scow
## 
### BUD AMES 
Nine parts planning and working
for every one part of materials and
capital is the formula being used by
Stanford Boat Club members in
building their practice rowing scow.
The resulting mixture is the 32-
foot-long wooden frame, in the base
ment of the Memorial Theater,
which is rapidly becoming a com
pleted and reported]// floatable prac
tice scow.
"Oh, it'll float right, but we
don't know how high the water linl
will be," explained Carl Gerlach,
who has been the directing genius
behind the constructor. go. l
the basic plans for the barge from
the California scow. Theirs floats, so
I guess ours will."
MEMBERS BUILD SCOW
Construction began about two
weeks ago after a decision by Boat
Club members to build the scow
rather than a shed to house the row
ing shell which Cal has promised to
lend to Stanford. Such lending,
however, will take place only upon
completion of a shed which will
protect that shell from the elements.
"The members want to get on the
water and start practicing, so the
shed will have to wait for a while,"
continued Gerlach. "Our funds,
which we collected from dues and
one donation, are first going into
building the practice barge."
GERLACH DRAWS PLANS
Basic plans for the scow came out
of the briefcase of Jack Yates, for
mer California assistant crew coach,
who will direct the Farm's future
rowers. Using these drawings as a
guide, Carl Gerlach drew new plans
which discarded or at least allevi
ated structural difficulties. With
these plans, which Gerlach must
frequently be called to interpret, 10
Boat Club members have been
working.
Statistically, the scow will meas
ure 32 feet in length, G feet wide,
| and 14 inches at its deepest point.
The majority of the frame is of
â–  Douglas fir. The bottom will be
I half-inch plywood and the 10 row
i ers seats of white pine.
"Tlio.se rowing seaLs are plenty
: tricky," continued Gerlach. "Each
j one runs in a track and rolls back
I forth on eight fibre rollers. And
i down the center ot the scow will run
i a catwalk so the coach can move
i among the rowers and give them in- 1
; structions. He can even hit them '
lover the head if he wants to."
BUILT TO LAST
Outstanding difficulty to date has 1
j been the creation of metal outrig- !
jgers which will hold the oars. As an !
j economical solution Gerlach has
| carved a wooden pattern of an out
-1 rigger using a California model. This 1
model will be used in the Stanford
| foundry to mold cast iron outriggers.
The Boat Club men are taking no
chances with their barge. Every
thing is strong and lasting. The
! rfolid, thick side pieces are about the
j longest pieces ol such lumber on the
Peninsula. And all the bolt heads
j have been chromium plated to pro
tect them against sea water. It ought
I to float.
The age of a rattlesnake is not
computed by the number of his rat
tles. A rattler may grow two to four
buttons a year.
