# Card Boatmen Produce Own Training Scow
## 
### BUD AMES 
Nine parts planning and working
for every one part of materials and
capital is the formula being used by
Stanford Boat Club members in
building their practice rowing scow.
The resulting mixture is the 32-
foot-long wooden frame, in the base
ment of the Memorial Theater,
which is rapidly becoming a com
pleted and reported]// floatable prac
tice scow.
"Oh, it'll float right, but we
don't know how high the water linl
will be," explained Carl Gerlach,
who has been the directing genius
behind the constructor. go. l
the basic plans for the barge from
the California scow. Theirs floats, so
I guess ours will."
MEMBERS BUILD SCOW
Construction began about two
weeks ago after a decision by Boat
Club members to build the scow
rather than a shed to house the row
ing shell which Cal has promised to
lend to Stanford. Such lending,
however, will take place only upon
completion of a shed which will
protect that shell from the elements.
"The members want to get on the
water and start practicing, so the
shed will have to wait for a while,"
continued Gerlach. "Our funds,
which we collected from dues and
one donation, are first going into
building the practice barge."
GERLACH DRAWS PLANS
Basic plans for the scow came out
of the briefcase of Jack Yates, for
mer California assistant crew coach,
who will direct the Farm's future
rowers. Using these drawings as a
guide, Carl Gerlach drew new plans
which discarded or at least allevi
ated structural difficulties. With
these plans, which Gerlach must
frequently be called to interpret, 10
Boat Club members have been
working.
Statistically, the scow will meas
