## 
### 
Beards and blue jeans for the men, gingham dresses for womenâ€”these
will he the rule at Stanford the week-end of March 8, according to plans
approved last night by Ex Committee.
Approving a program outlined by Bill Turner, chairman of the Back to
the Farm Celebration, the committee ratified his selection of the follow-

ling assistants: Jack Alltucker, head
of the Vigilantes; Bill Kimball, barn
dance; Pete Whittlesey, Alastair
Mac Donald, and Bud Ames, pub
licity. A beard-growing chairman is
yet to be appointed.
BARN DANCE SCHEDULED
Tied in with the week-end pro
gram will be Coach Clark Shaugh
nessy's arrival at Stanford March 7.
A barn dance is scheduled for the
next night.
March 9, Founders' Day, will in
clude the official opening of the
Boathouse'and a barbecue, which is
in charge of Axe Society.
During the whole week-end, Tur
ner explained, students must wear
clothing reminiscent of "the days of
the Rough and the 500." Vigilantes
and a "kangaroo court" will en
force this ruling, Turner said.
"We're leaving it general so there
will be room for originality," Turner
said.
AVOID EXTREMES
"We don't want people to go too
far, the way I hey did in the old
Rough Day, when some of them be
gan to see how much they could
look like Mother Death."
Barney Ferguson reported that
Dean of Men John Bunn had sug
gested a "Know-Your-Universily"
day be incorporated in the program.
The committee decided, however, to
restrict the activities to the Back to
the Farm theme.
