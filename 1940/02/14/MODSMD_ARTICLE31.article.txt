LOOSE ENDS PICKED
L P HERE AND THERE
Dean of Men John Bunn recently
had a book published entitled "Bas
ketball Methods." Put out by Mac
millan Company, it has received
very good reviews. Dean Bunn was,
of course, Stanford's varsity coach
for seven years before he moved to
his present position, the great
Laughing Boys, led by Hank Lui
setti, being his outstanding contri
bution during that period.

The University of San Fran
cisco is taking up crew for the
first time this year. In their first
practice row the Dons circled a
Russian freighter Hying the ham
mer-and-sickle flag, meanwhile
making numerous wisecracks
meant solely for Soviet consump
tion. Enough of the Russians un
dertsood English that the Coast
Guard cutter that arrived soon
after was none too early.
