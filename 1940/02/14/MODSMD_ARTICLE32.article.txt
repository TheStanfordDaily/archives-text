## JERRY MAYER, Sports Editor Varsity Nine To Meet Seal All-Stars Here Dahlgren May Play In Diamond Battle Slated Today at 3:15 
### 
Major and minor league baseball
stars will take over again today on
the sunken diamond when Harry
Wolters' Card varsity plays host to
the Kenealy Seals, a San Francisco
all-star club. Game time is 3:15, with
no charge for admission.
The last time the Seals came down,
when they the Cards, 8-7,
Babe Dahlgreu, Dario Lodigiani, Ted
Jennings, and George Mandish were
in the lineup. The same bunch is
expected today, with the probable
addition of Augie Galan.
Dahlgren is the regular first
saeker for the world champion New
York Yankees, having stepped into
Lou Gehrig's post when the "Iron
Horse" was forced to retire last sea
son. Although not a slugger, Dahl
gren is one of the smoothest fielders
in either major league.
Lodigiani, making his third ap
pearance this season on the Farm
diamond, will step into the regular
second-base job when Connie Mack's
Athletics head south this spring.
Ted Jennings is one of the most
promising prospects in the Pacific
Coast League. He works at third for
the San Francisco Seals. Mandish
starred for Hollywood last season.
Augie Galan broke into the majors
several years ago with the Chicago
Cubs, and has since been traded to
Brooklyn.
