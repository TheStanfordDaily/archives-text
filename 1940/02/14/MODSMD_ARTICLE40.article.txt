# Ski Roster Claims 340 Snow Fiends
## Farm Barrel-Stave Club Swells Rapidly Since 1937 Inception 
### 
The Stanford Ski Club of today, |
with ils membership of 340, bears j
rot even a family resemblance to j
its ancestor, the Ski Club of 1937. j
Three years ago, only a handful
of students made the trip to Yose- j
mite, and it was unheard of to go j
any farther than 200 miles for skiing. )
Today, over a hundred Stanford |
students make the Yosemite trip to- |
gether every week-end of the sea- |
son, and ski teams from the Farm
c< mpete in meets as far away as !
Sun Valley.
A great deal of this change is due, |
of course, to the growing enthusiasm j
of Americans in general for skiing, ,
but a large part of Stanford's in- j
terest in the barrel-stave sport is i
due to the activities of the Ski Club. |
STARTED 15V SWISS
The Ski Club was started by |
Ernst Willy Meyer, an energetic I
little Swiss who came to Stanford j
in the fall of 193fi. Meyer had skied |
all his life, and being a ski en- j
thusiast of the first order, ho could !
hardly believe Jim Reynolds, who
was then student body president,
when he told him that the only ski
club in existence at Stanford j
was the exclusive Alpine Club, most j
of whose members had already grad- |
uated.
Meyer was not daunted by the ap- j
parent lack of interest in skiing on j
the campus, and he gathered around .
him the few who really loved the I
sport. These he organized into the |
Stanford ski team, which surprised j
everyone by placing fourth in the i
Coast Intercollegiate meet at Yose- j
mite in the spring of 1937.
COURSE STARTED
That fall, Meyer returned to |
school determined to make Stanlord |
ski conscious. With the sport start- j
ing to take hold all over the country, j
he had no trouble in getting stu- j
dents interested in a course in dry j
skiing which ho started on the cam- I
pus. He and Bill Janss, now cap
tain of the ski team, together started j
the Ski Club.
In January of 1938, members of the i
club applied to Ex Committee for
offiical minor sport recognition on
the campus. It was denied them on j
the recommendation of Harry Ma-!
loney, minor sports director, who j
Ijelieved that skiing was "just a j
mushroom that will disappear over
night."
SPORT RECOGNIZED
Last year with skiing grown from j
a fad into a recognized winter sport, j
Ex Committee granted official rec- i
ognition to the sport. A team from
the club took part in the first an- i
nual Reno Winter Carnival to be ]
sponsored by the University of Ne- |
vada.
This year, the Ski Club has set- |
tied into the groove of a smoothly
run, well-established organization.
Student rates on the upski, rental j
of equipment, and rooms at Yose
mite are made possible through the ,
efforts of the club.
Ski teams made up of the mem
bers of the club have competed in i
events at Yosemite and Sun Valley, j
as well as taking third place at the i
Reno Winter Carnival the first
week-end of this month.

the Ski Club.
In January of 1938, members of the i

SPORT RECOGNIZED
Last year with skiing grown from j
a fad into a recognized winter sport, j
Ex Committee granted official rec- i
ognition to the sport. A team from
the club took part in the first an- i
nual Reno Winter Carnival to be ]
sponsored by the University of Ne- |
vada.
This year, the Ski Club has set- |
tied into the groove of a smoothly
run, well-established organization.
Student rates on the upski, rental j
of equipment, and rooms at Yose
mite are made possible through the ,
efforts of the club.
Ski teams made up of the mem
bers of the club have competed in i
events at Yosemite and Sun Valley, j
as well as taking third place at the i
Reno Winter Carnival the first
week-end of this month.
The Stanford Ski Club of today, |
with ils membership of 340, bears j
rot even a family resemblance to j
its ancestor, the Ski Club of 1937. j
Three years ago, only a handful
of students made the trip to Yose- j
mite, and it was unheard of to go j
any farther than 200 miles for skiing. )
Today, over a hundred Stanford |
students make the Yosemite trip to- |
gether every week-end of the sea- |
son, and ski teams from the Farm
c< mpete in meets as far away as !
Sun Valley.
A great deal of this change is due, |
of course, to the growing enthusiasm j
of Americans in general for skiing, ,
but a large part of Stanford's in- j
terest in the barrel-stave sport is i
due to the activities of the Ski Club. |
STARTED 15V SWISS
The Ski Club was started by |
Ernst Willy Meyer, an energetic I
little Swiss who came to Stanford j
in the fall of 193fi. Meyer had skied |
all his life, and being a ski en- j
thusiast of the first order, ho could !
hardly believe Jim Reynolds, who
was then student body president,
when he told him that the only ski
club in existence at Stanford j
was the exclusive Alpine Club, most j
of whose members had already grad- |
uated.
Meyer was not daunted by the ap- j
parent lack of interest in skiing on j
the campus, and he gathered around .
him the few who really loved the I
sport. These he organized into the |
Stanford ski team, which surprised j
everyone by placing fourth in the i
Coast Intercollegiate meet at Yose- j
mite in the spring of 1937.
COURSE STARTED
That fall, Meyer returned to |
school determined to make Stanlord |
ski conscious. With the sport start- j
