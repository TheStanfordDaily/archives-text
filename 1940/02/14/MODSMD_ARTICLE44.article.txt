# Ski Tournaments Test Speed, Skill, Control in Four Events
## 
### 
Competitive skiing is grouped into
four divisions, downhill racing, sla
lom racing, cross-country, and
jumping. The first two are gener
ally of the greatest intei'est to ama
teur skiers since few acquire the
skill required by the most danger
ous events.
Downhill races are won on speed.
They are held over long steep slopes,
and the skier going through the fin
ish flags first takes the prize, pro
viding he hasn't cut any forbidden
corners.
Courses for this event are from a
mile to five miles long and drop be
tween 1,000 to 5,000 feet.
Slalom racing is a severe test of
skill and control as well as of speed.
Competitors are required to run
through pairs of flags set at fairly
close intervals to provide a zig-zag
course.
The slalom winner is the skier
who can negotiate all the turns and

! hazards of the course in the shortest
I time. Entrants race one at a time,
being clocked at start and finish.
Slalom racing is considered less;
dangerous than the other types of
racing because speeds attained are
not so great. It gains added interest
from the fact that the flags may be
| placed to correspond to trees in
open country running.
Cross-country races are usually
the longest, and involve skiing over j
l all types of country and under all
conditions. Contestants start at in
tervals and are judged by their time j
in covering the course.
Ski jumping is the most danger- j
ous type of ski competition. It is j
judged on both distance and form, )
the contestant making the longest !
jump without falling and in reason- I
ably good form taking the prize.
