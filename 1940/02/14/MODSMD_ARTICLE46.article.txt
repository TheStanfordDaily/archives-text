# Skating Motion Used For Running on Level
## 
### 
On a slight down-grade, too gen
tle to run, the skating motion is used.
As in ice skating, the motion is
rhythmical and is used to some ex
tent in cross-country skiing. Strik
ing off with the right foot, one shoulrj
edge the right ski before momentum
has been lost, push hard to the lcXt,
lifting the right ski high and out of
the way.
