# Farm Ski Team Captain Outlines 'Arlberg Turn' Technique, Traces Origin
## 'Shining,' Started by Scandinavians, Spreads to U.S.; Stanford Grad Promotes Popularity in California 
### BILL JANSS 
Captain, Stanford Ski Team
Skiing lias finally come into full bloom in America. By many skeptics |
i( had been thought merely a flare-up of interest in a foreign novelty, but
ski resort increase and increased sale in ski goods have dispelled the
idea. With such great resorts as Vosemite, Lake Placid, and Sun Valley |
leading the way. it has readied an amazingly high peak in a very short
period.
Skiing ;ts a specialized scientific sport has existed in its modern sense
for less than thirty years. The pioneer skiers of Scandinavian terrain, j
where skim;' amounted to little more A _ i

than running cross-country, were
confronted with unprecedented diffi
culties when they first found them
selves on the steep, abrupt slopes oi
the Alps. They knew little of turn
ing. Their excellence came in then
ability to move quickly over the flat
land, jusi as they are doing today in
their light to save their homes.
TERM DDI INED
It was the Scandinavians, by the
way, who originated the term ski
ing (pronounced shiing). When they
moved across the dry, powdery snow,
their skis caused a "shi" sound every
stride they made. The sound caught
their fancy as well as their car, and
thus the term originated.
At the beginning of tliis century,
the focal point of .skiing moved to
the Alps, where great interest was
being shown.
Here the steep .slopes caused the
skiers to develop an entirely new
technique, one that involved high
speed running as well as controlled
turns. Willi the advent of this type
of technique, thousands quickly took i
it up.
ARLEBEIIG TECHNIQUE
Its details were developed and
perfected by Ilannes Schneider in
the Arlberg in Austria, and the fa
mous Arlberg school e,f skiing re
mains today as the most successful
and popular technique in the world.
It has been primarily fostered in
California by Dr. Don Tresidder, a
Stanford graduate, a member of the
Board of Trustees, and president of
the Yosemite Park and Curry Com
pany. At the present time the Yo
semite Ski School, under the direc
tion of Luggi Foeger, formerly head
instructor of the famous Schneider
School, ranks one of the most
outstanding schools in the United
States.
METHOD DEFINED
The Arlberg technique, as taught !
by Luggi, can be summed up in two i
phrases: first, bodyvswing, and sec- |
ond, forward lean. Counter swing
or body swing, the initial phase of
a turn, may be described as a "wind
up" preparatory to the turn.
It obviously implies turning the
shoulders to the direction opposite
the turn in order to have some force
from which to initiate the principal
swing, which is used to execute the j
actual turn. However, an unweight- I
ing of the skis must be co-ordinated :
with the body swing-to in order to I
enable the skis to slide around more j
easily.
STABILITY NEEDED
The unweighting is accomplished j
by slightly crouching while in the J
counter-swing position, and rising '
as the swing starts. When the turn 1
is completed the skier drops back !
into tin crouch position for stability.
"Vorlage" or "forward lean" en
ters skiing in the midst of the turn
also. As the weight is lifted, there
should be a forward lean. This al
lows the rear of the skis to become
unweighted, enabling them to slide '
around easier. The forward lean :
lends stability as well as aiding in '
a clean-cut turn.

Skiing lias finally come into full bloom in America. By many skeptics |
i( had been thought merely a flare-up of interest in a foreign novelty, but
ski resort increase and increased sale in ski goods have dispelled the
idea. With such great resorts as Vosemite, Lake Placid, and Sun Valley |
leading the way. it has readied an amazingly high peak in a very short
period.
Skiing ;ts a specialized scientific sport has existed in its modern sense
for less than thirty years. The pioneer skiers of Scandinavian terrain, j
where skim;' amounted to little more A _ i

than running cross-country, were
confronted with unprecedented diffi
culties when they first found them
selves on the steep, abrupt slopes oi
the Alps. They knew little of turn
ing. Their excellence came in then
ability to move quickly over the flat
land, jusi as they are doing today in
their light to save their homes.
TERM DDI INED
It was the Scandinavians, by the
way, who originated the term ski
ing (pronounced shiing). When they
moved across the dry, powdery snow,
their skis caused a "shi" sound every
stride they made. The sound caught
their fancy as well as their car, and
thus the term originated.
At the beginning of tliis century,
the focal point of .skiing moved to
the Alps, where great interest was
being shown.
Here the steep .slopes caused the
skiers to develop an entirely new
technique, one that involved high
speed running as well as controlled
turns. Willi the advent of this type
of technique, thousands quickly took i
it up.
ARLEBEIIG TECHNIQUE
Its details were developed and
perfected by Ilannes Schneider in
the Arlberg in Austria, and the fa
mous Arlberg school e,f skiing re
mains today as the most successful
and popular technique in the world.
It has been primarily fostered in
California by Dr. Don Tresidder, a
Stanford graduate, a member of the
Board of Trustees, and president of
the Yosemite Park and Curry Com
pany. At the present time the Yo
semite Ski School, under the direc
tion of Luggi Foeger, formerly head
instructor of the famous Schneider
School, ranks one of the most
outstanding schools in the United
States.
METHOD DEFINED
The Arlberg technique, as taught !
by Luggi, can be summed up in two i
phrases: first, bodyvswing, and sec- |
ond, forward lean. Counter swing
or body swing, the initial phase of
a turn, may be described as a "wind
up" preparatory to the turn.
It obviously implies turning the
shoulders to the direction opposite
the turn in order to have some force
from which to initiate the principal
swing, which is used to execute the j
actual turn. However, an unweight- I
ing of the skis must be co-ordinated :
with the body swing-to in order to I
enable the skis to slide around more j
easily.
STABILITY NEEDED
The unweighting is accomplished j
by slightly crouching while in the J
counter-swing position, and rising '
as the swing starts. When the turn 1
is completed the skier drops back !
into tin crouch position for stability.
"Vorlage" or "forward lean" en
ters skiing in the midst of the turn
also. As the weight is lifted, there
should be a forward lean. This al
lows the rear of the skis to become
unweighted, enabling them to slide '
around easier. The forward lean :
lends stability as well as aiding in '
a clean-cut turn.
