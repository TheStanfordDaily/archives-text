# Skiing Becomes Popular Sport Among Colleges
## Norwegian Sport Fools Critics; Jumps To Prominent Spot 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
"Whistling in the dark" was the
laconic criticism leveled by critics a
very few years ago to pass off Ihe
arguments of ski fans that skiing
would eventually become an im
portant college sport.
But few, if any, predicted that the
Norwegian sport would catch on al
most overnight to become not only
a nationwide recreation, but an in
tegral part of the college life of a
vast number of students in univer
sities throughout the country.
The rush to participate in the
thrill-packed sport framed the im
portance of skiing as it exists today;
not only as a means to fascinating
intercollegiate competition, but a
means to week-end enjoyment for
thousands of outdoor - minded col
legians.
INSTRUCTORS HIRED
Predominantly a New England
sport, skiing in the east has devel
oped a characteristic sideline of "ski
instruction" which has been capital
ized upon by many Atlantic *sea
board collegians, who use adopted
Scandinavian names to lure custo
mers from the packed snow trains
from New York, inaugurated by
business-hungry eastern railroads.
Taking their cue from eastern ex
amples, and promoting extensive ad
vertising campaigns, ski outfitters
and winter sports projects such as
Sun Valley have brought the sport
to the western states in recent years
to a greater degree by creating a
demand for, and easy transportation
to, snow areas.
It has been estimated that the
number of skiers has tripled each
year in the United States lor the
last three winters, until there are
now almost a half million people
who may be found each week-end
on the slopes at any one of the
American centers. The vast majority
of these enthusiasts are college stu
dents.
TECHNIQUE DEVELOPED
Skiing really came into its own
after the development of modern ski
technique by the famous Arlberg
school in St. Anton, Austria. This
technique made it possible to nego
tiate the steepest slopes with safety,
by utilizing turns. Thus, skiing was
brought out of the hazardous class
into a sport which everyone could
enjoy.
One of the foremost colleges in
the United States to popularize the
sport through the "lean years" of
â– development has been Dartmouth,
known for its promotion and tor its
excellent ski teams.
Foremost western college propo
nents of skiing include the Univer
sity of Nevada, University of Wash
ington, University of California,
University ol Utah, and Stanford
University's team, captained by Bill
Janss.
JANSS LEADS TEAM
A fortnight ago Janss led the
Stanford team to a third place po
sition in the fourth Intercollegiate
Ski Tournament sponsored by the
University of Nevada near Reno.
California won the event with
33.38 points, garnering first place
in the slalom team classification and
first in cross-country to displace
Nevada, defending champion for the
last three years. Stanford won the
downhill race and slalom.
