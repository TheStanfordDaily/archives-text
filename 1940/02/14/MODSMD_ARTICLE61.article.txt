Ever since skiing became Amer
ca's favorite winter sport for men
ind women, ski fashions have been
ncreasingly important, especially
rom the feminine point of view.
\fter the warmth problem was set
led, women turned their thoughts to
rolcr and fabric, and last of all to
mick-knack accessories for ski ex
cursions.
San Valley, as the recognized lead
•r in fashion for western ski fans,
las reported increasing changes in
ki costume themes. Tyrolean styles
re prevalent as they always have
Deen, but since war conditions have
nade it increasingly difficult to im
port German and Czechoslovakian
•oods, Norway has become the fa
vorite for the latest imported ski
ash ions.
•ASTKLS POPULAR
Popular colors have taken a turn
or pastel shades this year as a
,'liange from the ever-practical navy
jlue. Pale greens, gray-greens and
natural shades have been the choice
>f women skie-s this year, and all
white costumes, are vying with red
or those who want "glamah" when
daloming or spilling. Novelty shades
ike- Dartmouth green or Redwood
usl are still seen only occasionally.
Most women still rely on a bright
jcarf or hat for variety.
Glamour can be carried further by
nvesting in a new outfit of the new
processed poplin. Although this
abric gives a richer look to ski togs,
t has not yet proven itself as prac
tical nor as warm as the old stand
by, water-repellent gabardine.
NORDIC FAVORITES
Imported socks, caps, and gloves
from Norway are favorites, made of
goat and sheep wools woven in black,
brown, and white Nordic motifs of
reindeer and tree designs.
Latest in the accessory line are
round red wool pouches with black
and white Tyrolean borders, in
which ski wax, cigarettes, lipstick,
jr any other feminine gadget can fit.
The belts on which these pouches
hang should be hung with bells if
you want, to follow this years gay
styles. Bells are found on every
hing, from caps on down to socks.
Lodge lashions are becoming in
creasingly informal. Dresses are
rarely seen these days, the trend is
toward slacks and shirts every
where. The casual note is what ev
eryone is striving for in after-ski
comfort.
Socks with leather soles are worn
in the lodges to the exclusion of al
most any other type of footgear.
Usually in bright colors, these handy
slipper-socks are embroidered in
Tyrolean style, with bell laces and
water-proof cowhide soles.
The chief crops of Spain are wheat,
rye, barley, oats, corn, rice, potatoes,
sugar beets, olives and grapes.
