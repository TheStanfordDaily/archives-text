# Ski Equipment Demands Care
## Preparation for Hot Weather Essential 
### 
The true ski enthusiast spends as
much time taking care of his tem
peramental equipment as he spends
in the snow.
When the season is over the skier
must prepare his skis for the warm
summer months. To prevent the
warping ol skis, the tops should be
refinished, and the bottoms shel
lacked. This keeps the moisture con
tent fairly consistent.
They should be stored in a cool
dry place, never in an attic. The
best method of blocking the ski is
to cut a two-by-four the length of
the ski, strap one ski on each side,
and place a one-inch block under
each loot plate.
Boots should be kept waterproof
by occasional greasing. Soles may
be treated with a coat of lacquer or
linseed oil. Too much greasing will
make the uppers porous and use
lessly soft. Soles should never be
greased.
