# Uphill Maneuvers Demand Practice

### 
To come down, you must first go
up. This is a fundamental principle
in skiing as in everything else. On
the average slope, the most efficient
method of ascension (going up) is
"herringboning," which consists of
going directly uphill with skis at
right angles to each other. Placing
one ski forward at a time, you leave
a series of V's in your path.
Switch-back or zig-zagging is used
on stec r ~r slopes, while the worst
inclines require slow but sure side
stepping. On a slight incline it is
possible to advance perfectly straight
with skis parallel, providing you
make proper use of the poles and
have done a good job of waxing on
the skis.
