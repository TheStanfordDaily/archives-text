# Men's Togs Use Light Fabrics, Bright Colors
## Waterproof Socks, Norwegian Mittens Grow in Popularity 
### 
For those winter week-ends of
| skiing at Yosemite, the Sugar Bowl,
\ or elsewhere, proper equipment is
| essential. And that means in the
! line of clothing as well as the skis
I themselves.
Lightweight, smooth fabrics are
| now being featured for men's ski
: garments in contrast to the heavy
| woolly ski suits of the past. They
I shed the water and snow and still
\ keep one warm through the coldest
weather.
Of primary concern is the ski
boot. The soles should be made of
I heavy leather with a steel shank
j and straight sides to lit the bindings
snugly. The toes should be square
; with steel reenforcements and the
I heels may be made of either leather
j or rubber, but necessarily must be
j grooved to hold the heel strap ol the
I binding.
j WOOL SIIIItTS POPULAR
; Tw< pairs ol wool socks should be
I worn, a light pair next to the foot,
I with a heavier pair over them. The
best socks are the imported hand
made type such as the Norwegian
Selbu, which are more completely
waterproofed by the natural oil of
the wool.
i The next garment of importance
| to consider is the ski pants. In place
! of the loose, long pants coming to
I the ankle, the long, narrow, stream-
I lined pants have become popular,
j Wool gabardine is the most practical
material and they are made with a
■ band under the instep to keep them
i in the boots.
Jackets or windbreakers of poplin
| are most popular and practical.
■ They should be worn over wool
I shirts or sweaters.
MITTS FLANNEL-LINED
Wind mitts keep the hands the
j warmest and driest. They are can
i vas gauntlet style with flannel lin
; ings. They iasten snugly at the wrist
; to keep out snow.
I Anything goes in the way of color,
| but navj' blue pants are the most
popular with brown a close second.
Jackets may be in bright colors but
natural or sand seem to rank first.
And be sure to get contrasting col
ors unless you are very proficient in
j your skiing because a perfectly
I matched outfit is the first mark of a
I novice.

waterproofed by the natural oil of
the wool.
