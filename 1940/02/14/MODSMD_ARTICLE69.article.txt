DEAR Jack and Doug:
In the face of years of hallowed tradition
it is quite out of step with convention that I
should be addressing this letter to two men
instead of the usual single defeated associate
editor. The accepted practice is to run a "sorry,
old man; hate to lose you" editorial the morning
afterâ€”and try to forget about the evils of the
system until the next election comes along.
However, this year the apple-cart was upset
when three candidates ran for the editorship.
And I frankly must admit that I was not sorry
to see it happen.
Starting about four years ago and tracing
history backv/ard, one soon discovers that Daily
elections used to involve more dirty politics
than has ever been seen on this campus before
or since. Every kind of crooked deal was at
tempted, and many of them worked.
A rigid constitutional system was Instituted to
clean up this corrupt mess. What the reformed
set-up guaranteed was this: Two associate edi
tors ran for editor, one of them won, and the
other smiled sadly and walked off into the
sunset. A clause did exist (and still does) al
lowing the members of the staff to nominate a
third candidate, but it was so seldom used that
the two-man slate almost became an unwritten
law.
This system was good for The Daily in that
it purged it of political graft. But at the same
time it did the paper a great deal of harm by
depriving it of the services of one of its two
best men each volume. The losing candidate
never would come back to run again because it
wasn't the thing to do.
More often than not the two strongest men
were picked to stage a good fight for the editor
ship for the first half-year, and two weaker con
testants were left for the second volume. Every
one agreed that it was a rotten system, but no
one did much more than shrug his shoulders
and shake his head about it. Obviously The
Daily had become the victim of its own purge.
Yesterday, however, the once-holy precedent
was broken. Bublications Council saw fit to
give the managing editor constitutional permis
sion to run, a majority of the staff was willing
to put his name on the ballot, and it voted for
him to seal the bargain.
With the idol destroyed, it is extremely prob
able that in future elections not only managing
editors, but also defeated associates will be
given the chance to run. It is to be hoped that
other unsuccessful candidates will be wise
enough to follow your lead, Jack, and accept
other top positions on the staff.
Because it broke the two-man tradition, I be
lieve that the Daily election for Volume 97 will
go down in local history as a successful experi
ment.
And now, if this were a traditional editorial,
I would pat you both on the back and tell you
what fine work you have done as associate edi
tors. But you and I know that there is no real
meaning in that.
Both of you have given the best that you
have to The Daily, and I believe that you have
been completely successful in all the work you
have undertaken.
I could thank you for myself and for the staff,
but I did that this afternoon. Now I am going to
extend the thanks of the students cf Stanford
University to whom for the past few years you

have contributed far more than nimble minds
and skillful fingers on the typewriter keys. You
have given yourselves.
Larry
