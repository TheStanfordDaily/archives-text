EXCOM last night approved Cardinals' plans
for a "Back to the Farm" week-end, March
7, 8, and 9. The celebration won't have much
social significance, it is not a "cause," no per
sons or countries will be beneficiaries.
But in spite of this, or perhaps because of it,
Stanford's old home week will be the most im
portant item on the University calendar for a
week.
Students will be given a rare chance to sate
that peculiar desire to "dress up," to be some
body else, to escape from the real v/orld into
a fantasy of make-believe.
Mustaches, hesitant or full-blown, will be
cultivated. The clothes worn by the Rough will
be resurrected from wherever they have been
laid, to make a brief, nostalgic return to the
Quad. Gingham dresses and hair ribbons will
turn Stanford women into demure misses.
A barn-dance, a barbecue, and the opening of
the Boathouse on Founders' Day will make the
celebration a thoroughly local affair.
Into this unusual Stanford will step Clark
Shaughnessy, when he arrives March 7. Per
haps his inauguration as head football coach
during this three-day return of the old order will
presage a like return of the Big Red Machine
next fall.
Since it is not a relief drive, Stanford's old
clothes week won't mean much to the world
at-large. But who cares that? If it achieves
a boom in Cardinal spirit, that will be enough.
