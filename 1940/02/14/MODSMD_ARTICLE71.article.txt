### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
APOLOGIES TO HERB CAEN
JY'fEMO TO MYSELF: Seven o'clock, two young Stan
ford blades taking a shower in one of Encina's
most popular shower rooms. One of the showerers
forgot his towel. Rumor says he used tissue paper.
Very funny stuff.
Ten o'clock. Stanford's cafe society starts in the
morning. Union Cellar was agog with gay young Row
women and Farm smooth boys clinking cokes and cof
fee cups. I have it 011 inside information that a cer
tain prominent lady from the Pi Phi house will soon
be wearing a Zete pin. The Zete doesn l know it yet.
Fine predicament.
One o'clock question: Who is the so-called biology
major who checks out of lab every day for a look at
the hills out Searsville way? And incidentally, what's
the attraction on the Sandhill Road?
Nine p.m. (skipping the sleepy afternoon hours):
L'Omelette jammed. I'm not sure yet, but there must
be some famous orchestra conductor's daughter sing
ing there. I have yet to find a place that, doesn't
have an orchestra conductor's daughter. And she's
pretty charming.
SCOOP: Clark Shaughnessy will be Stanford's new
football coach, I have it on reliable authority! The
boys in on the know say that Chicago's contribution
to football has a winning personality. (Bill Leiser
claims to have printed this information some time ago.
Have you been reading my column, Bill?)

U 1 YETEMS: Lots of them in the Roble lobby. One
belongs to that sleek new Packard convertible
seen so often in the hands of a certain law grad. . . .
Crowded polls on the Engineering Corner. Row afraid
the Halls are organized, and vice versa. Neither one
really is, they say . . . Daily Shack bubbling over
with excitement in anticipation of election returns,
their own returns. In the commotion the chorus of
the Union song "Solidarity" was heard a block away.
I wonder what a certain prominent Republican would
say?
VERY DISGUSTING STUFF: A senior broke his
leg skiing and someone kicked the crutches out from
under him. Wo were amazed and shocked. (Are we
socially conscious!)
THESE FOOLISH THINGS: One boy made a slip
of the tongue with a sorority gal. He didn't know
that the popular name for the Phi Psi fraternity had
a double implication. . . . Another slip: history stu
dent didn't know his prof was standing right behind
him when he was complimenting the prof on being
better than Ovaltineâ€”for putting people to sleep.
Great to be a gossip!
