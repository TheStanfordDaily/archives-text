## HONORS FOR NO. 1 LAUGHING BOY 
### 
r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
While this column has been filled with articles
on the Finns, rides to Paly, etc., a matter was brought
up in Sideline Slants today that really deserves at 4
tention.
It was suggested that Hank Luisetti's number 7 be
put away with Ernie Nevers' number 1. It is amazing
that this hasn't been done before. After all, Hank was
the greatest collegiate basketball player, with even
fewer to dispute his title than Ernie Nevers has had.
In three years Hank made basketball a paying, pop
ular sport at Stanford. Aided by the other Laughing
Boys, Dinty Moore, Howie Turner, Jack Calderwood,
and Art Stoefen. Hank made the rest of the United
States realize that Stanford was one of the leading
basketball schools.
All the proselyting and subsidization that any schools
may use will probably not turn out another Luisetti.
As a tribute to him and basketball, Ex Committee
should vote to take No. 7 out of competition as soon
as possible.
