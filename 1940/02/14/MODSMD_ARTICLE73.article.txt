r rilE EDITOR, SIR:
'Twas reallv a surprise 1o me 1o read in The
Daily that I would be doing "Russian Baby-killing" in
the forthcoming neutral show Thursday night. It was
probably due to some misunderstanding. Surely "Rus
sian Baby-killing" would be quite unneutral and we
wouldn't want to do that. (Shhh. Thorne. they*ll think
you're a Communist sympathizer.)
The truth of the mutter is that yours truly is sched
uled to do an "Adult Killing" act—the reverse of ihe
baby-killings. The idea was first given in the Gaieties
a few years back bv Hal Kahn, back in the old As
sembly Hall days. Horrors, man. we must stay neutral.
