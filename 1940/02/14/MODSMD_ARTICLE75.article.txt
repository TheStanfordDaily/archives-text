"APPOINTMENT IN SAMARRA"—
John O'llara.
To understand the kaleidoscopic
career of its author is to understand
the cogent fatalistic drama of John
O'Hara's novel, "Appointment in
Samarra," recently reissued in pock
et-size edition.
That this masterfully handled, yet
brutal story of America's contempo
rary "sinning" middle class "packs a
wallop" is unmistakably a truth and,
at the same time, unmistakably an
understatement.
And the power behind the wallop:
springs from the life of the author, i
who was kicked out of three prep |
schools, and consequently skipped i
college.
KALEIDOSCOPIC CAREER
The kaleidoscope of O'Hara loomsj
as a refined stumblebum's paradise: j
evaluating engineer, steward on a!
ship, secretaiy in a briqueting plant, |
call-boy and freight clerk on the
Pennsylvania Railroad, soda jerker, |
reader of gas meters, guard in an \
amusement park, laborer in a steel j
mill, movie press agent, and secre-»
tary to Hey wood Broun. Ten years j
in newspaper work preceded his de- l
but as a novelist.
O'Hara's hard-boiled dialogue, his'
passionate descriptions, and steady
succession of compromising situa
tions centering around the destined ,
life of the protagonist are well done.
But the real beauty, if beauty it is,!
is found in the fatalistic import of I
the novel.
This fatalism of "Appointment in I
Samarra" is characteristically pre- j
ordained in the masterful preface j
by W. Somerset Maugham, from j
which the work takes its name.
MIDDLE CLASS SAGA
Perfection of plot is sacrificed to j
some extent, as is the climax, for de- j
velopment of what might be termed j
the saga of an eastern or middle- j
western middle class businessman, I
who finds time to drop in at the of- i
fice to worry about business when
country club brawls and champagne j
parties will permit. The denouement
is as inevitable as it is predictable.
Around his protagonist. O'Hara i
groups a small-town circle
the late 'twenties: jealous wiws,
country club gossip, social complica- j
tions of industrial areas, bootlegger, j
pimp, "friendly" cutthroat business j
competitors, roadhouse, champagne,j
gunman, mistresses. Throw in a bot- j
tie of Scotch, the background and j
ability of the author, and you have j
the unmistakable ingredients for a j
powerful novel.
HUMOR IS RELIEF
By way of comparison, O'Hara's!
language, like Steinbeck's, is hardy I

as a chestnut, and often downright
funny. That it should be hardy is
determined by the subject matter,
honestly portrayed. That it is funny
proves to be the only vacation the
author gives his characters from
destiny.
By way of comparison, "Appoint
ment in Samarra" finds its position
in literature as an epitaph to the
futility of the 'twenties, in the same
fashion Tarkington's "Turmoil"
evaluated industrialization's nouveau
riche.—Shafer
