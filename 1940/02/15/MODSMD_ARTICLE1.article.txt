### DWICHT HUTCHINSON 
r T , HE world hasn't forgotten that
little water polo game off the
coast of South America during
Christmas vacation.
After that incident, so packed
with drama, when the British
cruisers crippled the pocket battle
ship Graf Spee and forced it to run
for shelter, the president of Panama
protested to Germany, France, and
Britain in the name of all the signa
tories of the Panama Conference
declaration. And yesterday Ger
many formally rejected as "without
grounds" the protest of the Amer
ican republics against the violation
of the western hemisphere's "safety
zone" by belligerent warships.

The German reply was contained
in a note to the Panamanian foreign
minister. Britain and France replied
previously, so this made the third
of the series. They, however, re
jected the safety zone unless Ger
man warships could be kept out of
the American coastal waters.
The German note wasn't a frank
and definite rejection. There was
still room for negotiation. Ger
many, it said, would be willing to
discuss the subject further but
could see no hope for such future
discussions unless the attitudes of
Britain and France were revised.

GOOD bit of World War ll's
difficulties center around the
sea, vast, neutral and intensely im
portant. Britain's detention of
American vessels at blockade port
is an item that has aroused plenty
of indignation here. Yesterday the
United States' anger was levelled
equally against Germany after she
announced that "theoretically," at
least, our ships might be considered
fair prey for Naiz U-boats.
If Germany torpedoes any Amer
ican ship forced into belligerent
waters by British blockade regula
tions, the United States could hold
both Great Britain and the Nazi gov
ernment responsible. American ves
sels are forbidden by the U. S. Neu
trality Act to enter belligerent areas
voluntarily.
Hardly had the German threat of
reprisals for the British blockade
reached this country than Secre
tary of State Cordell Hull went into
a hurrie.i conference with Lord
Lothian, the British ambassador, to
discuss anew this nation's demands
that Britain stop taking U.S. ships
into forbidden war areas.

AT a press conference earlier, Hull
wouldn't comment on the Nazi
announcement except to say the
rights of belligerents to sink neutral
vessels are well defined in interna
tional law. From Capitol Hill way,
Chairman Key Pittman of the in
fluential Senate Foreign Relations
Committee, called the German state
ment a "violent and illegal threat"
but added it's "within the power of
Great Britain, by ceasing its prac
tice of forcing our ships into its
ports, to remove this very grave
danger." On the other hand, Sena
tor Guy Gillette, Democrat, de
scribed the German announcement
as "hardly open to criticism."

Aside from a small group, how
ever, Senators and Congressmen
were extremely wary about making
any statements. It was a ticklish
situation and they insisted upon
playing it cagey. Pittman's state
ment seemed to lack a good bit of
the fire and invective that he usu
ally packs into dissertations on to
talitarian governments.
The German announcement was
actually—at least by virtue of its
timely appearance — an excuse for
torpedoing that Dutch liner, the
Burgcrdijk, off the English channel.
