# Two Soph Men Cop Prom Bids
## Moran, Bull Eke Out Win in Song Contest 
### 
A free bid to tomorrow night's
Senior Prom was awarded yester
day to Sophomores Charles Bull
and Bill Moran, joint winners of a
contest for the longest list of dance
tunes whose titles contain the word
"heart."
The content was inspired by the
valentine motif of the dance, which
will be held tomorrow night in the
Women's Gym from 9 to 1 o'clock.
After three ineligible song titles
had been stricken out, the winning
list contained 121 titles.
BROCK TAKES SECOND
Runner up was Dave Brock, whose
list contained 118 titles. Six others,
among the scores of entries, con
tained more than 100 song titles us
ing the word "heart."
Music for the Prom will be pro
vided by Joe Reichman, the "Pag
liacci of the Piano," who promises
smooth, danceable music and says
he will play any number his patrons
request.
OPTIONAL FORMAL
Dress will be "optional formal,"
according to Prom Chairman Dick
Wright, who defines this term as
formals for women and either tuxes
or dark suits for men.
Cokes will be served at 5 cents a
bottle, it was announced yesterday,
Bill Kimball having been granted
the concession.
