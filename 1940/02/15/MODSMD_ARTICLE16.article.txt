# Fire Specialists Install Encina Safety Exits
## $1500 Fire Escapes To Relieve Hazard Of Former Ladders 
### 
The gleaming new silver iron
work on the south face of Encina
Hall represents $1,500 worth of
safety fire escape for the notably
inadequately equipped hall.
Ordered by the University several
months ago from a San Francisco
firm of fire escape specialists, the
new outside emergency exits are
designed to adequately insure Ihe
clearance of the dormitory's 500
residents in case oi fire or other
emergency.
LADDERS REPLACED
The newly installed escapes are
replacing two old ladders which
scaled the side of the hall and which,
according to Fire Chief Dugan, were
"more of a hazard than a protec
tion."
Also added to the safety exits for
the hall is an escape from the "Bull
Pen" or third floor rooms above the
main lobby. No escape was for
merly provided for this part of the
hall in case a fire swept up the
main stairwell cutting off the normal
entrance to the "Bull Pen."
BULL PEN ESCAPK
This escape comes out of two of
the windows, descends in a "Y" to
the roof connecting the hall to the
Commons kitchen and living quar
ters.
Another cardinal principle of fire
safety is that all main exit doors
should open outwards. At present
no action is being taken to relieve
the fact that all main exit doors in
Encina open inwards, contributing
to a slower emergency clearing of
all hall residents.
