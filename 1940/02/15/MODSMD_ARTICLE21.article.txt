# Chapin Discusses British Hysteria
## 
### 
Dr. Leland T. Chapin, associate
professor of speech and drama, gave
his reactions of "The War from a
British Window" last night on the
Stanford University Hour.
He told of the apparent war hys
teria in the British Isles before the
war as he saw on his recent Eu
ropean trip. He told of the air raid
warnings in Scotland during the
Firth of Forth bombing.
Dr. Chapin attributed the lack of
air raids during the night to the ef
fective use of the blackout. "Any
householder who has even a fine
streak of light shining from a win
dow is immediately warned, and if it
is not remedied, he is subject to im
prisonment and fine."
