## Government Licenses Subjects to Enlist Despite 1870 Law 
### 
LONDON, Feb. 14 (UP). —
Great Britain today officially
opened the doors to British sub
jects wishing to enlist in the Finn
ish Army to aid in the fight
against the Russian invaders.
Finnish sources said that 2,000
Britons already had volunteered for
service at a recruiting office near
the Finn legation here.
Charles Peake, Home Office un
der-secretary, announced in the
House of Commons that a general
license had been granted British
subjects to enlist in the Finnish
army.
Meanwhile, the National Labor
Council decided to submit, to the
government a report urging imme
diate dispatch to Finland of war
materials, especially heavy guns and
airplanes.
BRITONS VISIT FINLAND
The report was made after a visit
to Finland by a delegation headed
by Sir Walter Citrine, British labor
leader..
Peake told the House of Commons
that the government had carefully
considered the matter of permitting
Britons to enlist in the Finnish army
in the light of the League of Na
tions' resolution of Dec. 14.
Peake said that the government
believed it would be "inconsistent
to the spirit of the terms of the reso
lution that British subjects who wish
to volunteer for service in Finland
should be hindered by provisions of
the Foreign Enlistment Act, seeing
that the act contains the power to
grant dispensations."
FINN AID PROMISED
Great Britain had informed the
League of Nations that she would
aid Finland as much as possible in
her war with Russia.
The announcement that Great
Britain was going to furnish men for
Finland came after Laborite Dennis
Nowell Pritt had demanded that per
sons organizing a volunteer corps
for Finland be prosecuted.
Pritt had asked the Home Office if
it was aware that an organization
was at work in London for the pur
pose of enabling volunteers to pro
ceed to Finland.
The Laborite directed attention to
the Foreign Enlistment Act of 1870
which made it illegal for any Brit
ish subject to enlist for service with
the forces of any foreign state en
gaged in warlike operations with a
friendly state.
LICENSE GRANTED
Peake replied that there were cer
tain dispensations in the act which
permitted Great Britain to grant
license for enlistment in the forces
of other nations.
"Accordingly," Peak said, "a gen
eral license has been granted Brit
ish subjects to enlist with the Finn
ish forces. A license, too, has been
granted for a recruiting organiza
tion which has been established in
London."
Anticipating an answer to Pritt's
question, Ivan Maiski, Soviet am
bassador to London, was in the dip
lomatic gallery during question time
but actually did not hear the reply
because it was not reached during
that period.

The announcement that Great
Britain was going to furnish men for
Finland came after Laborite Dennis
Nowell Pritt had demanded that per
sons organizing a volunteer corps
for Finland be prosecuted.
Pritt had asked the Home Office if
it was aware that an organization
was at work in London for the pur
pose of enabling volunteers to pro
ceed to Finland.
The Laborite directed attention to
the Foreign Enlistment Act of 1870
which made it illegal for any Brit
ish subject to enlist for service with
the forces of any foreign state en
gaged in warlike operations with a
friendly state.
LICENSE GRANTED
Peake replied that there were cer
tain dispensations in the act which
permitted Great Britain to grant
license for enlistment in the forces
of other nations.
"Accordingly," Peak said, "a gen
eral license has been granted Brit
ish subjects to enlist with the Finn
ish forces. A license, too, has been
granted for a recruiting organiza
tion which has been established in
London."
Anticipating an answer to Pritt's
question, Ivan Maiski, Soviet am
bassador to London, was in the dip
lomatic gallery during question time
but actually did not hear the reply
because it was not reached during
that period.
LONDON, Feb. 14 (UP). —
Great Britain today officially
opened the doors to British sub
jects wishing to enlist in the Finn
ish Army to aid in the fight
against the Russian invaders.
Finnish sources said that 2,000
Britons already had volunteered for
service at a recruiting office near
the Finn legation here.
Charles Peake, Home Office un
der-secretary, announced in the
House of Commons that a general
license had been granted British
subjects to enlist in the Finnish
army.
Meanwhile, the National Labor
Council decided to submit, to the
government a report urging imme
diate dispatch to Finland of war
materials, especially heavy guns and
airplanes.
BRITONS VISIT FINLAND
The report was made after a visit
to Finland by a delegation headed
by Sir Walter Citrine, British labor
leader..
Peake told the House of Commons
that the government had carefully
considered the matter of permitting
Britons to enlist in the Finnish army
in the light of the League of Na
tions' resolution of Dec. 14.
Peake said that the government
believed it would be "inconsistent
to the spirit of the terms of the reso
lution that British subjects who wish
to volunteer for service in Finland
should be hindered by provisions of
the Foreign Enlistment Act, seeing
that the act contains the power to
grant dispensations."
