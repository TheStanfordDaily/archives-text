# Stanford Ruggers Whip Dons, 21-6, in Muddy Tilt
## Cards Show Improvement In Easy Win Kmetovic Leads Indian Scorers; Wylie Lauds Play of Farm Squad 
### PAT NOWELL 
Playing on a sloppy field, Stan
ford's ruggers out-mucked an in
experienced U.S.F. club 21-(> last
night on the practice field, and
showed marked improvement while
doing so, according to Head Coach
Jim Wylie.
The Dons drew first blood when
Pete Franchesi, American football
star, intercepted a Cardinal lateral
and galloped 25 yards for a try. The
conversion failed, and the Indians
went to work, ringing the bell for
21 points before Smith of U.S.F.
scored on a short passing rush near
the end of the game.
KMETOVIC SCORES
Pete Kmetovic opened the Indian
scoring when he scooped up a loose
ball and dashed 45 yards to pay
dirt; Austin converted. The next
two Stanford scores followed drib
bling rushes â€” Yank Levin getting
credit for one when he fell on the
ball over the goal, and Ned Pugh
and Aubrey Austin grabbing the ball
over the goal for the other. Austin
converted one and missed one, the
half-time score reading 13-3.
Stanford missed two other scoring
chances in the first half when Aus
tin and Pierce missed difficult free
kicks.
AUSTIN CONVERTS
One minute after the second half
opened, Kmetovic finished a 15-yard
(.Kissing rush by crunching over the
goal through three Don tacklers.
Austin converted again, and ten
minutes later turned a free-kick
into three more points and the final
Cardinal tally.
Coach Wylie was particularly
pleased with the improved work of
the forwards, and praised Austin,
Pugh, and Pierce particularly. The
backs, although hampered by the
wet ball, staged some fancy passing
rushes, and showed greatly im
proved teamwork, according to the
coaching staff.
Backfield men Kmetovic and Mc-
Murray earned the praise of the
Coaches with fine team play.
