# Card Hoopmen Entrain Today To Face Uclans
## Twelve Farm Capers Travel South to Play Improved Bruin Five 
### 
When California became the vie- j
lim of U.C.L.A. this season, an old i
score the Bruins held against the j
! Southern Divisioners finally was
! settled.
Not satisfied with having taken
! care of the record of 30 straight
| conference defeats, the Bruins are
| out to settle some even longer
| scores—and these are directed against
j our own Indians and the terrible
| Trojans.
After beating the Bears late in
j 1937, it took the Uclans a little more j
than two years to work up another 1
! good offense to drub the Bears and !
! end the streak.
RRUIN VICTORY
[ Now we come to the grudge '
« against Stanford. Once upon a time, j
I when the "Laughing Boys" were j
i mere sophomores, the Bruins de
{ leafed the Indians, 44-37, in a real
upset. That was Jan. 11, 1936, in Los •
Angeles.
Since then the Bruins haven't i
come close to taking the Farm's j
measure, and a total of 1(5 games
have elapsed since the Westwood
' ers last caught Luisetti and Co. Un- j
| awares.
The last time fhe Bruins had a
j real conference scoring threat was
I in 193(J when Johnny (Basket) Ball
! was runner-up to Luisetti. Today
: the Southerners have Jackie Robin
son, Negro flash who has managed to ;
i score 85 points or about 40 per cent j
i of his team's total.
RECORD THREATENED
I An even longer losing streak to f
j U.S.C. remains unbroken and even :
, that record may be threatened be- j
I fore the Bruins end their series
| against the Trojans this year.
In both games won by Stanford j
from Ucla the first of the season,'
j 53—38. and 40-36 ,the Indians kept t
j the Bruins from making more than I
i a handful of set shots. The rest of !
j them were from 15 to 20 feet out on
the floor. The Bruins can set up |
| blocks but all their shooting has had |
| to come from far out. and it will be j
I that which the Indians will have to J
I stop.
Twelve men leave on the South- j
ern Pacific at 7:40 o'clock tonight |
for the Southland. These are Don !
Williams, Ken Davidson, Dick Tay
-1 lor, Bob Penn, Fordy Anderson,
j Leon Lafaille. Bob Wensel, Bill |
Cowden, John Alltucker, Gil Rahn, j
, Tiff Denton, and Frank Wells. The
i game is scheduled for U.C.L.A,'s
Westwood gym.
