# Papooses to Swim Against S.F. State
## 
### 
The Stanford freshman swimmers
meet the combined freshman and
varsity mermen of the San Fran
cisco Slate College tomorrow at 4
o'clock in the Encina Pool.
Judging from the results of their
meet with the California varsity, the
San Francisco team seems to be a
potent outfit and should give the
liosh a tough afternoon.
