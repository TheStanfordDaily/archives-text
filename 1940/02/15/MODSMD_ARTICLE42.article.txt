# Papoose Netmen Vie for Standings
## 
### 
Top notches on the freshman ten
nis ladder will be the objective of a
series of intrasquad matches which
began last week. Ladder standings
will determine the line-up for in
terschool matches.
Outstanding candidates for the six
singles and three doubles positions
are Captain Emery Neale, Harper
Ink, Charles Hutchinson, and Tom
Kruger. Hutchinson and Kruger
spent their prep years collecting
cups and titles in the Southland and
Neale and Ink are national ranking
juniors.
Ladder play will be continued un
til the beginning of the regular
match schedule Feb. 23. Rain last
week forced the racketeers indoors
to oil up their strokes under cover
of the Pavilion.
