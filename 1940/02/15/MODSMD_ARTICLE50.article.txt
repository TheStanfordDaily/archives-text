# All This and Heaven Too

ALTHOUGH they were at each other's throats
on most aspects of the situation, both op
ponents and proponents of Finnish relief in the
recent campus controversy agreed on one thing:
It was a wholesome sign that such a topic of
international importance should have been the
subject of universal interest and violent debate.
Now that the winds of freedom have blown
their course, Stanford is prepared to offer fur
ther evidence that it is not only level-headed
but also broad-minded. Tonight the campus is
going to laugh at the humorous aspects of the
situation at the benefit show for non-partisan
relief.
That the actions of any representative gov
erning body make first-rate material for comic
opera has been apparent ever since Gilbert and
Sullivan first formed a partnership. Anyone
familiar with their works or who knows what
the United States government looked like in
"Of Thee I Sing" will realize that Stanford's
Ex Committee offers almost limitless possibili
ties.
A satire on the relief controversy will be the
featured act in the "Little Gaieties" tonight in
Memorial Hall. But in addition to the witticisms
of Messrs. Bulotti and Muheim, the audience will
have an opportunity to hear a violin solo by
Maestro Ferenc Molnar, a light talk by Dr. Wil
bur, and a comic lecture by the econ depart
ment's celebrated Professor Fagan.
Although it will be especially strong on com
edy, the program will offer acts to suit every
tasteâ€”and all for a mere 25 cents.
To remark that the quarters received will go
to a worthy cause would be an understatement
of the worst kind.
When you consider that it is going to aid vic
tims of the Turkish earthquake and the Georgia
tornado, the starving Chinese, and hundreds of
load families in California's central valley in
addition to civilian sufferers in the nations en
gaged in the European war, the relief program
is more than charitable. It is really incredible.
