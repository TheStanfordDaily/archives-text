# Tough on Horse Rustling
## 
### 
DISPLAYING commendable foresight, Univer
sity officials recently locked their barn
door before the horse was stolen. But they did
not completely forestall a future nag-napper.
Carelessly they left the back door open, and
the horse can still be led out that way.
Spidery new fire-escapes are now clinging
like English ivy to the walls of Encina. Five
hundred freshmen may rest secure in their
knowledge that if someone drops a lighted
cigarette and the whole hall goes up in smoke
they can take to the windows and scramble to
the ground.
Offhand, this would seem to secure the horse
against any possible knavery.
But there remains a loophole in the defense.
Six main doorways to Encina still open inward;
six large doors, the focal points of escape for
a frightened mob, swing into the hall, not out
ward.
The potential traffic tie-up at these points in
the event of a panic could be tragic. There is
no reason to expect the new fire escapes to
bear the whole brunt of a hasty exit. It is rea
sonable to expect that some of the six doors
would not be involved in a fire, and would thus
provide an even better exit than escape ladders. |

Fire officials and fire regulations insist that
exits from a building swing outward. The safety
factor is obvious.
For a comparatively small expense, Stanford
can re-hang the doors, completing Encina's
needed fire safety program. Only then can the
horse munch his oats in complete assurance,
and laugh at the horse thieves left out in the
cold.—J. B.
