# Watch It!

EVER since the recent rumpus about the pass
ing of the smoking on the Quad tradition,
cigarette butts have been few and far between
beneath the sandstone arches.
At the same time the steps in front of the
Library have remained as littered as the floor
of a dime-a-dance hall. More smoking is done
there than at any other place on the campus, and
the result is an unsightly mess.
The other day, upon Ex Committee's sugges
tion, two stone receptacles filled with sand were
placed in front of the Libe. Their function is
obvious: they are meant to be filled with cigar
ette butts.
No longer need the Library steps look any
messier than the walk in front of the Chapelâ€”
if smokers will only have consideration enough
to throw their stubs in the ash receivers instead
of stamping them out on the ground.
