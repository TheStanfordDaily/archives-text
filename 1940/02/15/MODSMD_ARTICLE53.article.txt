### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
HERMAN, lIEAVEN, AND lIITLEK
" r pHERE have been two great men in the world's
history," Hitler once admitted, ''Jesus Christ and
myself." Then he added, "And Christ is dead."
It is my personal guess that old Adolph would want
to amend that statement now. He would want to in
clude his man Herman Goering as one of the world's
immortals. That would give the Nazi regime a two
thirds vote in the Holy Trinity, as Herman edged out
the Holy Ghost.
Exercising his divine prerogatives this week Saint
Herman told neutral nations that they would be held
responsible for any anti-Nazi statements that appeared
in their newspapers. Now there is a really angelic
dictum from one of Germany's jailers. Germany has a
controlled press. Editors are employees of Der Fueh
rer, paid with marks or bayonets, as the case may
warrant. It isn't hard to understand, then, why self
sanctified Herman should make the rather nervy as
sumption that democratic nations should regiment
their press. Herman is just being his usual old ab
normal self.
But one element in this daring line of reasoning
is hard to understand, even from the Nazi point of
view. Hitler's controlled press, from time to time,
blast neutral nations with the greatest of gusto. Her
man's own little journalistic mouthpiece insults the
statesmen of other countries by calling them "war
mongers. murderers, and organs of democracy." And
then with that consistent inconsistency characteristic
of Nazi propaganda, Herman tells these same neutral
nations to hold their editorial tongues.
Now it may be true that Adolph and Herman are
geniuses, as many people often claim, but even geniuses
are not qualified to assume the rest of the world to
be composed of morons. But apparently that is what
the rest of the world is in the minds of Nazi leaders —
just morons. Who but a moron could seriously con
sider a request for journalistic "decency" from Her
man Goering? It is as though some nice polite fellow
like A1 Capone objected to the use of euns. If A1 made
such an objection there might very well be some people
who would consider him reasonable. But they would
all be in guarded institutions.
The assumption that the rest of the world has no
brains at all is customary with people who have been
used to winning battles with ruthless ease. They mis
take a relative reticence on the part of the rest of
the world to become complete savages for a lack of
intelligence. Ruthlessness .and wit are one and the
same with Herman and Adolph.
If Hitler's voice were just a little bit more powerful
he would probably shout orders to God. "Ho there,
Wotan," he would say, "hold up the sun for an hour;
I'm still sleepy."

myself." Then he added, "And Christ is dead."
It is my personal guess that old Adolph would want
to amend that statement now. He would want to in
clude his man Herman Goering as one of the world's
immortals. That would give the Nazi regime a two
thirds vote in the Holy Trinity, as Herman edged out
the Holy Ghost.
Exercising his divine prerogatives this week Saint
Herman told neutral nations that they would be held
responsible for any anti-Nazi statements that appeared
in their newspapers. Now there is a really angelic
dictum from one of Germany's jailers. Germany has a
controlled press. Editors are employees of Der Fueh
rer, paid with marks or bayonets, as the case may
warrant. It isn't hard to understand, then, why self
sanctified Herman should make the rather nervy as
sumption that democratic nations should regiment
their press. Herman is just being his usual old ab
normal self.
But one element in this daring line of reasoning
is hard to understand, even from the Nazi point of
view. Hitler's controlled press, from time to time,
blast neutral nations with the greatest of gusto. Her
man's own little journalistic mouthpiece insults the
statesmen of other countries by calling them "war
mongers. murderers, and organs of democracy." And
then with that consistent inconsistency characteristic
of Nazi propaganda, Herman tells these same neutral
nations to hold their editorial tongues.
Now it may be true that Adolph and Herman are
geniuses, as many people often claim, but even geniuses
are not qualified to assume the rest of the world to
be composed of morons. But apparently that is what
the rest of the world is in the minds of Nazi leaders —
just morons. Who but a moron could seriously con
sider a request for journalistic "decency" from Her
man Goering? It is as though some nice polite fellow
like A1 Capone objected to the use of euns. If A1 made
such an objection there might very well be some people
who would consider him reasonable. But they would
all be in guarded institutions.
The assumption that the rest of the world has no
brains at all is customary with people who have been
used to winning battles with ruthless ease. They mis
take a relative reticence on the part of the rest of
the world to become complete savages for a lack of
intelligence. Ruthlessness .and wit are one and the
same with Herman and Adolph.
If Hitler's voice were just a little bit more powerful
he would probably shout orders to God. "Ho there,
Wotan," he would say, "hold up the sun for an hour;
I'm still sleepy."
HERMAN, lIEAVEN, AND lIITLEK

history," Hitler once admitted, ''Jesus Christ and
