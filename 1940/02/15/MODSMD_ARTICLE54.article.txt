# CAMPUS OPINION
## IT GAVE HER A LIFT 
### 
EDITOR, SIR:
It is a matter of record which can be easily
verified by reference to Ambrose and Smith's "Treatise
on Life Expectancy" (1929 â€”N.Y.) that a cigarette
smoker's health is not necessarily impaired by consist 7
ent usage of tobacco.
My gi'andmother died at the age of 103, having
been an inveterate smoker for 83 years. The consult
ing physician, when interrogated by inquisitive parties,
states, "It is probable that her life would have been
prolonged at least a decade had she not been pregnant
at the time of her fall from the polo pony."
However, I do not profess to be overbearing upon
this subject. Smoking is indeed an expensive habit.
I am acquainted with a famous surgeon who chose the
tobacco habit when confronted with starvation. So
please don't misconstrue my statements. Just because
my father owns 50 shares in The American Tobacco
Company is no reason for me to be biased.
Sincerely yours,
"Smoking Joseph"
