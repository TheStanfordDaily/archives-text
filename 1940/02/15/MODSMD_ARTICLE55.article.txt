# HEAVEN IN THE HALLS

HPHE EDITOR, SIR:
From what I hear, being only a transfer, every
year about this time the elections conjure up Row
and Hall spirit. This seems valuable to me if only the
fact that these opinions give many underclassmen a
chance to solemnly nru theii heads and see their
smallest problems seriously appear in print. This
Greek question looked very important to me in my
Frosh year, and so immediate became the social pres
sure that I joined . You see anyone can
be a frat man at the U. of , where these organi
zations are surprisingly democratic.
Out of my hall window this morning I can look
across at Encina men, some of whom have pledged
and others who I know hav» regained independents.
Isn't it strange, Mr. Editor, that many frosh I know,
who are disinterested in women, find no social prob
lems at all? I see no difficulty with the Greek ques
tion. Call Encina Sigma Rho, arm the sponsors with
paddles, and you have it. In a while you will see the
Frosh looking longingly over at Toyon.
As a senior transfer, worried about medical ac
ceptance. give me a hall!
