# 'Fighting 69th' Rehashes World War Melodramas
## 
### 
"THE FIGHTING (J9TH," now showing at the Stanford Theater in Palo
Alto, starring James Cagney, Pat O'Brien, and George Brent.
For those who like a noisy, blood-and-thunder film epic with scattered
scenes of tender sentiment, and for those who want to he impressed by
the super-magnificent spirit of the U. S. Army, this is the show.

, It's just another World War pic
ture, with the old melodramatic plot
concerning a yellow soldier who
comes through at last in a burst of
glory and machine-gun fire to save
his regiment, and do his bit to make
the world safe for militarism. This
version, however, also has the added
attraction of Pat O'Brien's cheerful
mug in the role of a Catholic priest,
olic priest.
WITH BUGLES, SOFTLY
There are the usual long scenes,
too, of awe-inspiring parades. The
U. S. Army bravely marches by, the
cornerstone of the Citadel of Peace,
and all that guff again. It. must be
admitted that producer Jack Warner
did give a realistic picture of the
horrors of the trenches, but there
are some touching shots of melo
drama that even insult this D aver
age intelligence,
Jimmy Cagney gives another un
impressive, rather hyterical por
trayal of the coward who makes
good, and George Brent turns in a
flat performance as a hard-boiled
officer. O'Brien handles his pious
role in a somewhat indifferent fash
ion, but even so, he's more convinc
ing than the rest of the boys.
NEXT WEEK, lIEDY
Incidentally, there isn't a single
girl in the show. Not even to kiss
the brave lads good-bye as they
leave for France. This corner was
more interested in the trailer shots
of Hedy Lamarr's new picture, "I
Take This Woman," with Spencer
Tracy. On the same program is a
Philo Vance detective puzzler with
a dozen hams trying to unwind a
really complicated plot.—Dalton

"THE FIGHTING (J9TH," now showing at the Stanford Theater in Palo
Alto, starring James Cagney, Pat O'Brien, and George Brent.
For those who like a noisy, blood-and-thunder film epic with scattered
scenes of tender sentiment, and for those who want to he impressed by
the super-magnificent spirit of the U. S. Army, this is the show.

, It's just another World War pic
ture, with the old melodramatic plot
concerning a yellow soldier who
comes through at last in a burst of
glory and machine-gun fire to save
his regiment, and do his bit to make
the world safe for militarism. This
version, however, also has the added
attraction of Pat O'Brien's cheerful
mug in the role of a Catholic priest,
olic priest.
WITH BUGLES, SOFTLY
There are the usual long scenes,
too, of awe-inspiring parades. The
U. S. Army bravely marches by, the
cornerstone of the Citadel of Peace,
and all that guff again. It. must be
admitted that producer Jack Warner
did give a realistic picture of the
horrors of the trenches, but there
are some touching shots of melo
drama that even insult this D aver
age intelligence,
Jimmy Cagney gives another un
impressive, rather hyterical por
trayal of the coward who makes
good, and George Brent turns in a
flat performance as a hard-boiled
officer. O'Brien handles his pious
role in a somewhat indifferent fash
ion, but even so, he's more convinc
ing than the rest of the boys.
NEXT WEEK, lIEDY
Incidentally, there isn't a single
girl in the show. Not even to kiss
the brave lads good-bye as they
leave for France. This corner was
more interested in the trailer shots
of Hedy Lamarr's new picture, "I
Take This Woman," with Spencer
Tracy. On the same program is a
Philo Vance detective puzzler with
a dozen hams trying to unwind a
really complicated plot.—Dalton
