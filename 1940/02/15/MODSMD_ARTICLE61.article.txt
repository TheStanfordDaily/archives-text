NEW YORK. Feb. 14 (UP).—Se
lected industrial issues met strong
demand on the Stock Exchange to
day but the main body of stocks
drifted irregularly lower in quiet
trade.
Bulls said the showing was "sig
nificant" because the heavy buying
in the special issues indicated a
plentitude of idle funds awaiting in
vestment. But the Bears contended
the poor action of the so-called lead
ers was a sign that the financial com
munity would not support an ad
vance at this time.

In the years immediately preced
ing the war and the years following
it, it is estimated the farm mortgage
debt in the U. S. was increased
$450,000,000,000.
