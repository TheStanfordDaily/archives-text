a thousand fronts the his

That's a familiar sentence — over
the radio, on a screen, in print.
Coupled with a military tune, strong
with crescendo, the roll of drums
and blaring brass, it's pretty dra
matic. It's an emotional phrase
that, if you're impressionable, may
cause a thrill—the thrill of a flag
in the wind or a national anthem or
a Stanford rooting section hitting
that last "hail" in the alma mater.

This may be the drama of history,
whatever history is. Often though,
its real drama is beneath the sur
face, subjective. It's the drama of
the particular. And, too often, there's
no element of the dramatic at all.
Wilson called history the mem
ory of a people. And Webster de
scribed it as a narrative (hat re
cords and explains past events in
relation to human progress. That's
very impressive, but it doesn't
really tell the whole story. His
tory may be synthesis, reached
through the process of thesis and
antithesis. After writing under the
staggering title of "History 1910"
for nearly five months, I'm not
precisely sure what history is.
When I wrote my first column I
knew what it was; now I'm not so
sure.

of events flows in—from Paris,
from Londv) \ from Tokyo, from
Berlin, and and Rome and
Washington. On the United Press'
pounding teletype, the swift pattern
of words, written in the fire and
struggle of the vivid moment, makes
a variable story. Sometimes the
21,000 words that summarize each
day the record of the world tell of
death from wintery skies or grey
water—the quick, violent death of
bombs and torpedoes. Or occasion
ally it's a more pleasant tale. Presi

cruise in the gulf. Maybe he'll in
spect the defenses of the Panama
Canal and the offshore neutrality
patrol. Probably, though, he'll just
fish.
In Finland, the correspondents
are writing of a big battle on the
Karelian Isthmus along the Man
nerheim Line. For every Finn that
dies they say six Russians perish.
Occasionally the Soviets win a
battle, they tell us, but not so
often as the Finns. And if all this
is true, Russia must be depopu
lated and the Finns must each, in
dividually, be supermen.

JV UMBER Two Nazi Goering says
that Germany can't be beaten,
economically, militarily, or morally.
England, though, Goering says, is
feeling insecure right now. Cham

Along the Westwall two Ger
man raids on French advance posts
were repulsed with heavy losses,
even though the Germans assert
that they picked up a lot of French
prisoners. The German legation
in Oslo reports, officially, that
Germany is not co-operating with
Russia against the Finns. The
women of the Finnish Diet ap
pealed. yesterday, to the women
of the world to "let husbands and
sons come to our aid."
And the strange, tangled chron
icle unfolds, day by day and minute
by minute.
