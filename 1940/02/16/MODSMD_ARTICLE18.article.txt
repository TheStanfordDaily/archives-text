# Ducks Dunked As Chemistry Students Play

### BUD AMES 
"Shoot the sodium hydroxide to
me, Herman boy. And dilute a little
of that sulfuric acid. Oh, heavens,
it's almost time for the ultracentri
fuge experiment."
Such were the happy words last
night of the white-smocked students
who were mixing solutions and
erecting apparatus for Stanford's an
nual Chemistry Open House.
"This year's show is being put
on through the joint co-operation of
two chemistry fraternities and one
sorority, Alpha Chi Sigma, Phi
Lambda Upsilon and lota Sigma Pi,"
explained J. Wallace Jensen, one of
the student directors. "We had 150
spectators last year, and with this
year's publicity, we expect 300 to
night—despite the Finnish Relief
show."
OH, HORRORS!
Suddenly the protesting quacks of
a duck shattered the auditorium air.
Human hands dropped the duck into
an aquarium—and he floated. Then
the same hands rubbed the blaring
bird with a chemical substance,
dropped it back into the water —and
the duck sank.
"That's the same experiment de
picted by Life a couple of months
ago," explained Jensen. "We wash
the bird's feathers with a detergent,
something like soap, which removes
the oil. With no oil in its feathers,
the duck sinks."
As the open - house exhibitions
continued, Mr. Jensen acted as in
terpreter. One graduate student gave
a demonstration of ultracentrifuge
which resembles cream separation
on a scientific scale. This centrifuge
machine rotates up to about 4000
revolutions per second, and spins so
fast it can separate the sugar out of
a sugar solution.
WRAP IT UP
"Oh, why you can use the centri
fuge machine for lots of useful
things," Mr. Jensen continued. "We
have used it to pull the heavy pro
teins out of salamander eggs."
An assistant pushed forward with
an open jewel case in his hand.
"This is a real ruby and a real
aqua-marine," he expaincd, pointing
to two perfect stones. "But they were
made. The Germans have developed
a cheap process of making them out
of heated aluminum dust. They are
absolutely real though. As a result,
the price is dropping right out of the
ruby market."
And then science was forgotten.
Someone mentioned food, and the
crowd swept down the hall to the
refreshment table.

Lambda Upsilon and lota Sigma Pi,"
explained J. Wallace Jensen, one of
the student directors. "We had 150
spectators last year, and with this
year's publicity, we expect 300 to
night—despite the Finnish Relief
show."
OH, HORRORS!
Suddenly the protesting quacks of
a duck shattered the auditorium air.
Human hands dropped the duck into
an aquarium—and he floated. Then
the same hands rubbed the blaring
bird with a chemical substance,
dropped it back into the water —and
the duck sank.
"That's the same experiment de
picted by Life a couple of months
ago," explained Jensen. "We wash
the bird's feathers with a detergent,
something like soap, which removes
the oil. With no oil in its feathers,
the duck sinks."
As the open - house exhibitions
continued, Mr. Jensen acted as in
terpreter. One graduate student gave
a demonstration of ultracentrifuge
which resembles cream separation
on a scientific scale. This centrifuge
machine rotates up to about 4000
revolutions per second, and spins so
fast it can separate the sugar out of
a sugar solution.
WRAP IT UP
"Oh, why you can use the centri
fuge machine for lots of useful
things," Mr. Jensen continued. "We
have used it to pull the heavy pro
teins out of salamander eggs."
An assistant pushed forward with
an open jewel case in his hand.
"This is a real ruby and a real
aqua-marine," he expaincd, pointing
to two perfect stones. "But they were
made. The Germans have developed
a cheap process of making them out
of heated aluminum dust. They are
absolutely real though. As a result,
the price is dropping right out of the
ruby market."
And then science was forgotten.
Someone mentioned food, and the
crowd swept down the hall to the
refreshment table.
"Shoot the sodium hydroxide to
me, Herman boy. And dilute a little
of that sulfuric acid. Oh, heavens,
it's almost time for the ultracentri
fuge experiment."
Such were the happy words last
night of the white-smocked students
who were mixing solutions and
erecting apparatus for Stanford's an
nual Chemistry Open House.
"This year's show is being put
on through the joint co-operation of
two chemistry fraternities and one
sorority, Alpha Chi Sigma, Phi
Lambda Upsilon and lota Sigma Pi,"
explained J. Wallace Jensen, one of
the student directors. "We had 150
spectators last year, and with this
