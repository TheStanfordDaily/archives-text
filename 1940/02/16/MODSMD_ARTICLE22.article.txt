# Tonight's Prom Offers Medley Of Farm Songs
## Reichman Will Play Dancers' Requests; Decorations Lavish 
### 
Colored lights, valentine decora
tions, and a smooth orchestra will
transform the Women's Gym into a
festive ballroom at 8:45 o'clock for
the annual Senior Prom.
Limited to 400, bids have been on
sale all week at $3 at the A.S.S.U.
office. More than half of these had
beon sold when the office closed last
night. If there are any left after to
day's sales, they will be sold at the
door tonight.
'VALENTINE HOUSE'
Describing the decorations yester
day, Carl Phillips, decorations chair
man, told of a "valentine house"
which will be set up behind the
band stand. He said a spotlight, a
rotating mirror light, and colored
floods—red, white, and silver—will
provide a novel cffect.
Music will be by Joe Reichman,
often called the "Pagliacci of the
Piano," who brings his entire or
chestra to the Farm for the prom.
This will be his first engagement in
the bay area in some time, since it
is not until the following night, that
he opens at the Mark Hopkins in
San Francisco.
TO PLAY REQUESTS
Promising to play the music Stan
ford wants, Reichman sends word
he will play any tune requested. He
has formed a policy of making up
dance groups as the evening pro
gresses.
The dance is "optional formal,"
according to Dick Wright and Jane
LeCutler, co-chairmen of the prom
committee. They explain this term
as meaning formats for the women,
either tuxes or dark suits for the
men.
DRESS CIUESS
"I expect about half the men to
wear tuxes," Wright said yesterday.
Patrons and patronesses for the
Prom will be Mr. and Mrs Paul H.
Davis, Mr. and Mrs. David S. Jacob
son, Dr. and Mrs. Donald J. Gray,
Mr. and Mrs. David Bassett.
