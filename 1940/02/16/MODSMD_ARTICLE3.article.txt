# Goering Says Nazis Cannot Be Defeated
## Cities Plan to Import Million Pole Farmers To Bolster Economy 
### 
BERLIN, Feb. 15 (UP). —Field
Marshal Hermann Wilhelm Goering,
No. 2 Nazi and economic dictator of
Germany, in a broadcast speech to
German farmers tonight announced
sweeping measures to "assure the
German people's food and fat supply,
no matter how long the war lasts."
He declared Germany cannot be
beaten "militarily, economically or
morally," and England "now is feel
ing insecure."
He said 1,000,000 Poles would be
imported to work Rcich farms and
thousands of soldiers would be re
leased from the colors to do farm
work. Hitler youth also will be
called up to do spring work on the
land, he said.
DAIRY PRICES UP
Goering announced the price of
full milk and of butter would be in
creased —the first departure from

rigidly fixed foodstuff prices in sev
eral years. The Field Marshal said
Germany has 7,000,000 tons of grain
stored. Therefore, he said, Germany
must turn with all her energy to
counter the British blockade on fats
—credited by many with bringing
about Germany's defeat in the last
war—as the most important single
agricultural factor in German econ
omy.
Goering spoke for an hour and
seven, minutes to farm men and
women in his capacity as chairman
of . the ministerial council for Reich
defense. The place from which he
spoke was kept secret—a precau
tionary war measure accorded all
German leaders—but it was consid
ered probable he spoke from his
office here.
GOERING BOASTS
He boasted Germany's fat ration
was larger than Britain's.
'"The watchword for this produc
tion campaign is: Every hectare must
be planted," he told the farmers.
''We are devoted to our old prin
ciples of diligence and industry and
we thus have won the hate and envy
of the enemy. From all of you we
expect great achievements. The
weather has shortened the period of
growth but we expect you to do your
best."
POLISH WORKERS COME
Of the million Polish farm work
ers he said, "The first tens of thou
sands are already here. They were
not forced to come. They come be
cause they find work and bread and
money in Germany."
Referring to the German coal
shortage, Goering said: "Some of us
have been cold. This does not im
prove morale. We must, however,
not capitulate but conquer the diffi
culties."
He declared there was no i*eal coal
shortage because after the recovery
of Upper Silesia from Poland the
Reich had sufficient coal for all de
mands.

beaten "militarily, economically or
morally," and England "now is feel
ing insecure."
He said 1,000,000 Poles would be
imported to work Rcich farms and
thousands of soldiers would be re
leased from the colors to do farm
work. Hitler youth also will be
called up to do spring work on the
land, he said.
DAIRY PRICES UP
Goering announced the price of
full milk and of butter would be in
creased —the first departure from

rigidly fixed foodstuff prices in sev
eral years. The Field Marshal said
Germany has 7,000,000 tons of grain
stored. Therefore, he said, Germany
must turn with all her energy to
counter the British blockade on fats
—credited by many with bringing
about Germany's defeat in the last
war—as the most important single
agricultural factor in German econ
omy.
Goering spoke for an hour and
seven, minutes to farm men and
women in his capacity as chairman
of . the ministerial council for Reich
defense. The place from which he
spoke was kept secret—a precau
tionary war measure accorded all
German leaders—but it was consid
ered probable he spoke from his
office here.
GOERING BOASTS
He boasted Germany's fat ration
was larger than Britain's.
'"The watchword for this produc
tion campaign is: Every hectare must
be planted," he told the farmers.
''We are devoted to our old prin
ciples of diligence and industry and
we thus have won the hate and envy
of the enemy. From all of you we
expect great achievements. The
weather has shortened the period of
growth but we expect you to do your
best."
POLISH WORKERS COME
Of the million Polish farm work
ers he said, "The first tens of thou
sands are already here. They were
not forced to come. They come be
cause they find work and bread and
money in Germany."
Referring to the German coal
shortage, Goering said: "Some of us
have been cold. This does not im
prove morale. We must, however,
not capitulate but conquer the diffi
culties."
He declared there was no i*eal coal
shortage because after the recovery
of Upper Silesia from Poland the
Reich had sufficient coal for all de
mands.
