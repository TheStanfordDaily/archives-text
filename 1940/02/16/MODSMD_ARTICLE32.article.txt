month, 30 additional students were
named as "callers" yesterday.
These "callers," of whom 1(50 will

contributions to the University from
800 Palo Alto alumni.

Grannis, Bob Hadeler, Carlotta

nel!, Clair Peck, Rosamond Upson,
Oliver Wyman, George Reid, Mizi
Hinds, George Hislop, Virginia Ster
ry, Patty Bouchard, Mary Jane Den
nis, and Bob Billings.
Although no quotas have ever
been set by the Fund officers in
the past four years, the total col
lections by the Stanford Family
amounted to $48,000 last year.
NO QUOTAS SET
Branches of the Stanford Family
are students, faculty, alumni, and
friends, according to Bob Moulton,
chairman of the Council.
Members appointed to serve in the
student branch of the Family may
secure manuals describing the work
at the office of Mr. Dave JacoKson,
associate director of the Fund, up
stairs in the Administration Build
