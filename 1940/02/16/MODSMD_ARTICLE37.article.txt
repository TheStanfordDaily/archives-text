### JERRY MAYER 
Dear Frank:
it's all yours from here on in.
Starting Monday it will be your duty
to sit yourself down in this chair
every afternoon for the express pur
pose of filling a galley of type.
Some days it will lie easy, and
your fingers will mow down the
typewriter keys like Sherman
mowed down Georgia's grain fields
011 his way to the sea. But other
days it will come hard. Fervently
you'll pray for an idea—any idea.
And. In-other, what a god-awful
tooling it is to see a futilely empty
piece of paper in your machine
while the night editor is howling
for your copy so it can he set.
I don't know whether I accom
plished anything or not, Frank. But
I tried. I called them as I saw them
and let the chips fall where they
would. There's no point, as 1 see it. in
holding down a position like sports
editor unless you do your little part
in smoothing out any flaws you
think you see.
Let's see now what f stumped for
during Volume !)(i:
1. To retire Hank Luisetti's
number 7 from active competition,
first Sideline Slants published a
column written on the subject two
years ago by Walt Peterson, then
sports editor of The Daily.
Then Tuesday morning we wrote
an open letter to Ex Committee,
which met that night. The result
was that Excom appointed a sub
committee to look into the subject,
and they will undoubtedly vote the
measure through at the end of bas
ketball season. In case they forget,
Frank, a little prod from you would
n't. do any harm.
2. For the student members of
the B.A.C. to back up the school's
choice (as expressed in The Daily's
poll) for tile new football coach.
Of course, we know that Clark
Shaughnessy received their sup
port, but at least I think Slants
made the three student B.A.C.
members realize that the under
graduates who elected them were
vitally interested in how their rep
resentatives were voting. That in
itself makes us feel that we
emerged triumphant in this issue,
because for the last few years the
B.A.C. student members have more
or less been tools of the alumni
and faculty.
3. For the Row and Hall political
big-wigs to nominate a non-scholar
ship athlete for B.A.C. representa
tive opening at the mid-winter elec
tions. As it turned out, Clyde Jef
frey, a scholarship athlete, was elect
ed, but that makes us happy. We are
confident that Jeffrey has the per
sonality and intelligence to capably
represent the student body.
*!< *
We also took time out to nip at
the heels of the entire B.A.C. for
their actions in regard to the track
coaching situation.
First, when Tex Byrd was al
lowed to reject the head coaching
spot vacated by Dink Templeton.
!t was some finagling on the part
ol the Board that caused Byrd to
make academics his future rather
than athletics.
Second, when the B.A.C. named
Frank "Pitch" Johnson to succeed
Bill Ellington as head cinder man
at the end of this season, no matter
how successful a year Old Bill's
team enjoyed. I still think Ellington
should have been given a one-year
chance, at least, to make good.
In the matter of predictions we
didn't do .so badly; not too well,
either, come to think about it. Ev
ery time we picked the Indian grid
ders to win, they lost. But for that
matter they lost quite a few times
when we didn t even hazard a guess,
so that absolves us of all blame for
Stanford's string of defeats.
Way back in the early part of
January we predicted U.C.L.A.
would end its basketball losing
streak, and that California would
probably be the victim. We hit
that one right on the nose.
That's about all, Frank. Good
luck .
Yours sincerely,
Jerry
P.S.: You'd better put a new rib
bon in this typewriter. This one is
just about worn out.

the ratio of from 5 to 207 parts per

Let's see now what f stumped for
during Volume !)(i:
1. To retire Hank Luisetti's
number 7 from active competition,
first Sideline Slants published a
column written on the subject two
years ago by Walt Peterson, then
sports editor of The Daily.
Then Tuesday morning we wrote
an open letter to Ex Committee,
which met that night. The result
was that Excom appointed a sub
committee to look into the subject,
and they will undoubtedly vote the
measure through at the end of bas
ketball season. In case they forget,
Frank, a little prod from you would
n't. do any harm.
2. For the student members of
the B.A.C. to back up the school's
choice (as expressed in The Daily's
poll) for tile new football coach.
Of course, we know that Clark
Shaughnessy received their sup
port, but at least I think Slants
made the three student B.A.C.
members realize that the under
graduates who elected them were
vitally interested in how their rep
resentatives were voting. That in
itself makes us feel that we
emerged triumphant in this issue,
because for the last few years the
B.A.C. student members have more
or less been tools of the alumni
and faculty.
3. For the Row and Hall political
big-wigs to nominate a non-scholar
ship athlete for B.A.C. representa
tive opening at the mid-winter elec
tions. As it turned out, Clyde Jef
frey, a scholarship athlete, was elect
ed, but that makes us happy. We are
confident that Jeffrey has the per
sonality and intelligence to capably
represent the student body.
*!< *
We also took time out to nip at
the heels of the entire B.A.C. for
their actions in regard to the track
coaching situation.
First, when Tex Byrd was al
lowed to reject the head coaching
spot vacated by Dink Templeton.
!t was some finagling on the part
ol the Board that caused Byrd to
make academics his future rather
than athletics.
Second, when the B.A.C. named
Frank "Pitch" Johnson to succeed
Bill Ellington as head cinder man
at the end of this season, no matter
how successful a year Old Bill's
team enjoyed. I still think Ellington
should have been given a one-year
chance, at least, to make good.
In the matter of predictions we
didn't do .so badly; not too well,
either, come to think about it. Ev
ery time we picked the Indian grid
ders to win, they lost. But for that
matter they lost quite a few times
when we didn t even hazard a guess,
so that absolves us of all blame for
Stanford's string of defeats.
Way back in the early part of
January we predicted U.C.L.A.
would end its basketball losing
streak, and that California would
probably be the victim. We hit
that one right on the nose.
That's about all, Frank. Good
luck .
Yours sincerely,
Jerry
P.S.: You'd better put a new rib
bon in this typewriter. This one is
just about worn out.
Gold occurs in the sea water in
the ratio of from 5 to 207 parts per
100,000,000 of water.
Dear Frank:
it's all yours from here on in.
Starting Monday it will be your duty
to sit yourself down in this chair
every afternoon for the express pur
pose of filling a galley of type.
Some days it will lie easy, and
your fingers will mow down the
typewriter keys like Sherman
mowed down Georgia's grain fields
011 his way to the sea. But other
days it will come hard. Fervently
you'll pray for an idea—any idea.
And. In-other, what a god-awful
tooling it is to see a futilely empty
piece of paper in your machine
while the night editor is howling
for your copy so it can he set.
I don't know whether I accom
plished anything or not, Frank. But
I tried. I called them as I saw them
and let the chips fall where they
would. There's no point, as 1 see it. in
holding down a position like sports
editor unless you do your little part
in smoothing out any flaws you
think you see.

vitally interested in how their rep
resentatives were voting. That in
itself makes us feel that we
emerged triumphant in this issue,
because for the last few years the
B.A.C. student members have more
or less been tools of the alumni
and faculty.
3. For the Row and Hall political
big-wigs to nominate a non-scholar
ship athlete for B.A.C. representa
tive opening at the mid-winter elec
tions. As it turned out, Clyde Jef
frey, a scholarship athlete, was elect
ed, but that makes us happy. We are
confident that Jeffrey has the per
sonality and intelligence to capably
represent the student body.

We also took time out to nip at
the heels of the entire B.A.C. for
their actions in regard to the track
coaching situation.
First, when Tex Byrd was al
lowed to reject the head coaching
spot vacated by Dink Templeton.
!t was some finagling on the part
ol the Board that caused Byrd to
make academics his future rather
than athletics.
Second, when the B.A.C. named
Frank "Pitch" Johnson to succeed
Bill Ellington as head cinder man
at the end of this season, no matter
how successful a year Old Bill's
team enjoyed. I still think Ellington
should have been given a one-year
chance, at least, to make good.
In the matter of predictions we
didn't do .so badly; not too well,
either, come to think about it. Ev
ery time we picked the Indian grid
ders to win, they lost. But for that
matter they lost quite a few times
when we didn t even hazard a guess,
so that absolves us of all blame for
Stanford's string of defeats.
Way back in the early part of
January we predicted U.C.L.A.
would end its basketball losing
streak, and that California would
probably be the victim. We hit
that one right on the nose.
That's about all, Frank. Good
luck .
Yours sincerely,
Jerry

Dear Frank:
it's all yours from here on in.
Starting Monday it will be your duty
to sit yourself down in this chair
every afternoon for the express pur
pose of filling a galley of type.
Some days it will lie easy, and
your fingers will mow down the
typewriter keys like Sherman
mowed down Georgia's grain fields
011 his way to the sea. But other
days it will come hard. Fervently
you'll pray for an idea—any idea.
And. In-other, what a god-awful
tooling it is to see a futilely empty
piece of paper in your machine
while the night editor is howling
for your copy so it can he set.
I don't know whether I accom
plished anything or not, Frank. But
I tried. I called them as I saw them
and let the chips fall where they
would. There's no point, as 1 see it. in
holding down a position like sports
editor unless you do your little part
in smoothing out any flaws you
think you see.
Let's see now what f stumped for
during Volume !)(i:
1. To retire Hank Luisetti's
number 7 from active competition,
first Sideline Slants published a
column written on the subject two
years ago by Walt Peterson, then
sports editor of The Daily.
Then Tuesday morning we wrote
an open letter to Ex Committee,
which met that night. The result
was that Excom appointed a sub
committee to look into the subject,
and they will undoubtedly vote the
measure through at the end of bas
ketball season. In case they forget,
Frank, a little prod from you would
n't. do any harm.
2. For the student members of
the B.A.C. to back up the school's
choice (as expressed in The Daily's
poll) for tile new football coach.
Of course, we know that Clark
Shaughnessy received their sup
port, but at least I think Slants
made the three student B.A.C.
members realize that the under
graduates who elected them were
vitally interested in how their rep
resentatives were voting. That in
itself makes us feel that we
emerged triumphant in this issue,
because for the last few years the

and faculty.
