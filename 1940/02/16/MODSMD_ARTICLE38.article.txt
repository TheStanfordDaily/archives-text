# Frosh Five Set for Two Tough Tills
## Papooses will Face Marin, Santa Clara In Week-end Games 
### 
Hot on the trail of their sixth ar.d
seventh wins since they wore knock
ed over by Menlo .J. C. four weeks
ago, Stanford's freshman basket
bailers yesterday wound up prac
tice for a pair of tough contests
this week-end. They take on Marin
Junior College and Santa Clara
Frosh on Friday and Saturday
nights, respectively.
From all reports the Marin outfit
is one of the best teams that the
frosh have met all season, and per
haps better than any team they will
meet for the remainder of the sea
son. And the Santa Clara yearlings
are no slouches either, although
their record is not as impressive as
Marin's.
Marin drubbed Menlo Junior Col
lege 48-36 a lew weeks ago, and
since Menlo is the only team to
have defeated the Papoose squad
this season, the Marin quintet must
be rated favorites this Friday night.
Jack Dana, who was elected cap
tain for the season before the Cal
game, is still battling with Ed Voss
and Fred Linari for the forward
posts for the Card frosh. However,
Dana has been in a shooting slump
tor the last tew weeks, and, unless
he shakes it, may see the start of
the Marin fray from the bench.
The rest of the first quintet, Ed
Stamm, Walt Funabiki, and Leo
McCaffrey, are all in fine fettle and
are slated to start the week-end
contests.
