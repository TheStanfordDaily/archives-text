# Dear Arch:
## 
### 
IT was one bright xnorning three and a half
years ago that I found myself in a Western
Civ clas? sitting next to a good-looking blonde
from my home town.
Turning a little toward me in her chair and
mumbling an obligato to the instructor's lecture
cn the Cro-Magnon man, she remarked, "You
know, I'm trying out for the Daily staff; it s an
awful lot of fun." And she challenged, "Why
don't you go out for it?"
"Hell, I don't know anything about news
paper work; I couldn't write a story if I had to," I
hissed back.
Nevertheless, somehow or other I found my
self leaving Encina and walking past the Cellar
that same afternoon. The greenest of all green
frosh, I looked out of the corner of my eye at
the brown-haired girl with a seemingly perma
nent smile who was striding along almost be
side me.
"Hello," I gasped. She grinned back.
After hesitating a moment I blurted, "Can you
tell me where the Daily Shack is?"
"Certainly I can; I'm going that way myself."
It was just a little disconcerting when that
same smiling face was presented to the try
outees' meeting as Annalee Whitmore, manag
ing editor of The Stanford Daily.

A great many events have taken place since
that afternoon 1 first met Annalee walking
down the street. (For one thing the good-looking
blonde has been married.) Enough has hap
pened to make news for seven volumes of The
Daily. Scores of outstanding personalities have
disappeared from the Farm but just as many
new ones have come to replace them.
Despite the constant turnover in events and
people, this Stanford of ours does not show a
great deal of change. Perhaps it has improved
a little, we like to think.
If the last four years have made it a better
University, the students who have served it are
as much to be congratulated as are the Admin
istration and the faculty.
Gone are Jim Reynolds, Jeeb Halaby, Betty
Grover, Hank Luisetti, Don Moulton, Barbara
Paine, Irvin Jorgensen, Barbara Murphy, John
Dern, Tom Killefer, and the dozens of other
men and women who were outstanding in their
devotion to Stanford. Today there are Ken
Cuthbertson, John Cobbs, Coline Upshaw, Bob
Livingston, Jack Calderwood, Sherman Mellin
koff, Bob Moulton, and many others carrying
on their work.

Traditions have played an immensely impor
tant part in the building of Stanford. The friend
ly "hello" spirit is what makes this University
different from any other. But with one automo
bile to every three students and 4,200 in the
school it is becoming increasingly difficult to
hold on to it.
That The Daily had to fight to preserve the
Ride to Paly and No Smoking on the Quad
this volume indicates there is good reason for
all those who are really interested in Stanford
to worry a little. Maintaining our traditions
against the onslaughts of mechanical progress,
war-time cynicism, and junior transfers will con
stitute one of the biggest student problems for
the next few years.

Now that the end of Volume 96 is here, I real
ize that there are hundreds of other things I have
not gotten around to writing about. But it is too
late.
However, before I pound out my last 30-line
on this typewriter, there are just a few hasty
tributes that I want to pay:
To Bud Ames for writing more and better
stories, for doing the finest work as feature edi
tor that I have seen in three and a half years
at Stanford.
To Dwight Hutchinson for turning out an in
telligently written, comprehensive, informative
edition of my own favorite child, "History—
1940," every day.
To Jerry Mayer, who, assisted by Frank Guth
rie, Jerry Brucker, and company, has kept the
sports page lively not only when Stanford teams
won, but—what was far more difficult—when
they lost.
To the singing islander, WilLe Cannon, and
Scoot Hislop, and Lyman Wear for efficient,
well-organized night-editing that never let us
down.
To Mary June Montgomery for adding a

much-needed woman's touch to The Daily.
To Sherman Mellinkoff for following nobly
in a family tradition, turning out Bull Sessions
that were both humorous and thought-provok
ing.
To Gardner Miller for being the first Daily
head photographer who did not consider him
self an artistic genius and therefore never to
be depended on—and incidentally, for produc
ing excellent pictures at a fabulous rate.
To Herm Silverman, Marge Hovey, and Bob
bie Grass, all fine department heads; to Charlie
Bull, Jean Nowell, Mary Etta Farrell, Rosemarie
Mullany, Pat Smith, and Betty Kline, who as
head copy editors were likewise; to Mary Jud
son, Jeff Littleboy, Chuck Smith, and Harva
Sprager, who were of the same high caliber as
United Press editors.
To Ade Lurie, who graduated last December,
for handling practically every job that otherwise
would have been left undone—and all under
the title of news editor.
To Jack Burtt and Doug Jaques, whom the new
teletype machines made the first associate edi
tors who really had a definite job to do, for ex
cellent administrative work in the news room
and in the back shop, and for turning skillful
hands to writing editorials.
To Dick Dudman, the first associate editor who
did not consider his defeat in the election as a
personal insult, who came back to The Daily
to do brilliant writing, to offer willing aid and
valuable advice, and who has made himself an
indispensable part of our organization.
And to you, Arch, without whose friendship,
co-operation, and understanding, Volume 96
could never have succeeded.
When I promised last June that I was not
going to conduct any editorial purges or initiate
any superfluous campaigns, I meant it. This
volume merely has tried to meet situations
squarely and honestly as they have arisen. That
is the way I believe that a college newspaper
should be run—and besides I like to drink beer.
Six months from now, Arch, I think you will
appreciate the fact that I am not just turning
over to you the paper and the staff. I am leav
ing in your hands a share in the future of this
Stanford that we love so well.
Larry
