### SHERMAN MELLIN KOFF 
HOW TO FOOL YOUR FRIENDS AT A SYMPHONY
may be one of those unfortunate people who do
not honestly enjoy classical music. But there is
no need for you to despair. With a little self-discipline
and average deception-ability you can fool your
friends into thinking that, you are really mad about
Beethoven. From your tux collar to your patent
leather shoes you can come up to all visible conven
tional standards of culture.
Take (he symphony for instance. It is no trick at
all to dress the part of an enraptured music-lover.
And once you become the tenant of an appropriate
outfit, the evening's drama becomes a simple (if te
dious) matterâ€”well worth the approval of your aes
thetic friends.
The first move is to read Alfred Fi-ankenstein's re
view of the concert the day before you hear it. This
supplies the emotionally-petrified but ambitious aes
thete with an acceptable fund of proper comments
for an entire evening. With a really enthusiastic set
of inflections and suitable paraphrasing Frankenstein's
comments will sound like your very own ideas.

'T'HE difficult part of fooling your friends is sitting
through a couple of hours of sounds which mean
nothing to you. But the hardy actor can do it, realiz
ing as every society-conscious person does that the
show must go on.
The first thing to do is to assume an intent posture,
just as though you were listening. As a matter of fact
you will be watching the conductor's "expressive" ges
tures and observing what the rest of the people are
wearing. But don't relax for a moment. The stubborn
ness of the seat will do its best to dishearten you. The
atmosphere will be much too warm, and the lady sit
ting next to you will be wearing atrocious perfume.
But just sit there like a little martyr and look intent.
By all means do not clap until other people com
mence; you may reveal your ignorance by clapping at
the end of the first movement. But watch like a hawk
for an applauding hand raised at the wrong time. If
you see one, look down your nose, nudge the chap sit
ting next to you, and purse your lips as though to say,
"What a boor! What an ignorant boor! I'll wager he
never reads Alfred Frankenstein."
At the end of the concert, if you really want to make
an exceptionally musical impression, beat your friends
to the draw. Repeat the newspaper critic's comments
before they get a chance.
You will be a socially musical success. And hardly
anyone will be able to detect you. Your date may
even think you are a superior person. And before
long, you will begin to believe her.
