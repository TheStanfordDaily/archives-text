## SELF-CONSCIOUS PROFS 
### 
r jPHE EDITOR, SIR:
The other day I invited one of my professors to
be my guest at my dormitory's weekly faculty dinner.
He said, "No thank you"—and added merrily that I
seemed to "be an opportunist, with midterms right
upon us!"
Now. I don't apple polish. If I respect and admire
a man who's an authority in his Held, and I wear shoes
and behave myself, there's no reason why I can't
take advantage of an arrangement made by the Ad
ministration whereby I can know my professors out
side the classroom.
This man gave an example of a self-consciousness
that's getting more and more marked here at Stanford
and one that's just about destroying a pleasant, in
teresting tradition of American colleges. And I'm
sorry.
One of the things I came to this particular univer
sity for was the presence of a lot of good professors
who. in the peculiar atmosphere that is Stanford,
might be expected to put out more to their students
than an hour, three times a week, of lecture facts.
It s hard not to resent the whole damned thing.
Sincerely,
Hall Woman
