# Ex-Convict's 'Hell Trial' Wallows in Horror Tales
## 
### 
"IIELL ON TRIAL." by Rene Belbenoit, on sale at the Stanford Rook
store.
Here is the follow-up to Rene Belbenoit's "Dry Guillotine," which made
a considerable swirl in literary waters a few seasons ago. "Hell on Trial"
attempts to take up again a few aspects of life on and relative to the

French penal colony, Devil's Island, 4
and bare them to the bonified gaze .
of a literary world.
Bare them he does, too, with that j
well known Gallic frankness. Bel- |
benoit tells of leprous prisoners!
abandoned to their fate on an island
in the middle of the Maroni river.
Even though they are regularly in
spected by doctors, their lot is never
ameliorated.
He describes the life of the pris- I
oners in the penal colony—of liberes !
and relegues, condemned by some '
obscure workings of the French penal J
code to remain exiled in the jungle j
hell-on-earth after their regular !
sentences have expired.
INDICTMENT BITTER
Coupled with malaria, brutal 1
guards, poor food, maladministra- j
tion. Devil's Island stands as "a blot
on the name of a civilized nation," J
the author asserts with a commend- j
able mass of facts to back him up.
The book suffers a loss of power j
on three points—due mainly from !
factors not inherent. First of all,'
Devil's Island has been batted |
around in so many "B" pictures, sen- j
sational news and magazine articles,!
and radio thrillers that it just ain't j
news any more. Secondly, the author I
feels impelled to press the horror'
of the whole thing home with French j
explosiveness—with the result that !
every paragraph has at least two ex- i
clamations in it. And thirdly, the j
whole macabre opera boufle at
mosphere of the book makes the
work seem horribly unreal.
PLENTY OF THRILLS
Yet the book is not entirely de- j
void of thrills. There are adventure
stories galore in each isolated ac
count of a desperate prisoner's es
cape, and the more extreme human
emotions are close to the surface all
the way through.
Belbenoit is no faker. An ex
convict himself, he experienced har
rowing flights in a dugout canoe to
the South American mainland,
prison terms in solitary, fevers,
sweat, and starvation. His indict
ment of the French penal system
seems well founded, and every word
he writes carries with it another po
tential jail sentence for his expose
of the graft-ridden administration.
If you're in a bad mood, don't at
tempt this saga of death and crime
in the tropics. It's conducive to
gloom.—Littleboy
