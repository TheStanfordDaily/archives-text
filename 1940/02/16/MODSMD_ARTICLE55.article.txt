WASHINGTON, Feb. 15 (UP).—
Bitter denunciation of Great Brit
ain's seizure of U. S. mails broke
out in both houses of Congress to
day, concurrent with a warning to
Germany by Sen. Key Pittman, D.,
Nev., that the torpedoing of Amer
ican ships might drive this nation to
an "extreme point" short of actual
war.
Secretary of State Cordell Hull
emphasized at a press conference
American vessels still are under
strict orders to refuse convoys such
as Great Britain reportedly is pre
pared to offer U. S. ships.
OAKLAND. Feb. 15 (UP).—Eight
persons were injured yesterday in a
spectacular four-car crash that tied
up traffic in the Montclair district
and brought throe ambulances and
six police radio cais to the scene.
