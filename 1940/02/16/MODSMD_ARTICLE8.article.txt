# Relief Benefit Antics Fill Hall
## Fagan, Excom Satire Set Pace for Show 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Probably the majority of the au
dience which packed Memorial Hall
last night to see Stanford's non
partisan relief benefit didn't give a
damn who gets the cut—the Finns or
the Firehouse—but they did care
about the caliber of the show they
were going to see.
And they weren't disappointed.
It was a miniature Gaieties, with
out the build-up and slick produc
tion, but with a wit and a sponta
neity that kept the audience in the
aisles despite the fact that the show
indicated that it had been put to
gether in a hurry.
FAGAN FOR THE GAIETIES
Personally we are instituting a
campaign, stalling as of right now,
to put faculty members into Ram's
Head Shows. Our particular nomi
nee is Professor Fagan, who made
the problem of "just where the
money is going" an economic howl.
Marco Thome, replete in swad
dling clothes and an all-day-sucker,
killed a number of deserving, though
hypothetical, adults in a manner
which may nose out his more fa
mous baby killings.
'10 IN PALY RIBBED
The vignette ribbing " '40 in Paly"
was one of the neatest pantomimes
we've seen and Tony Cefaratti and
Thome said more without saying
anything than the whole list of vit
riolic campus opinions.
Two pianos and four musical
screw-balls—Dana Winters, Charlie
Bulotti, Bud Cady and Harry Mu
heim—turned a jam session into a
hilarious 15 minutes, with Muheirii
interpolating the lyrics to his own
"Top of the Libc."
EXCOM TAKES IT
With Excom proper sitting in the
first two rows and brazenly throw
ing pennies under a glaring spot
light, the much publicized Excom
take-off proceeded to rib unmerci
fully the whole relief set-up,
Hoover, Wilbur, the A.S.U., and
every member of Excom. It's a good
thing for John Lawry that Daily pro
motions are all wound up, for his
rendition of our man Livingston was,
to say the least, vivid. But. then he
works here.

Bulotti, Bud Cady and Harry Mu
heim—turned a jam session into a
hilarious 15 minutes, with Muheirii
interpolating the lyrics to his own
"Top of the Libc."
EXCOM TAKES IT
With Excom proper sitting in the
first two rows and brazenly throw
ing pennies under a glaring spot
light, the much publicized Excom
take-off proceeded to rib unmerci
fully the whole relief set-up,
Hoover, Wilbur, the A.S.U., and
every member of Excom. It's a good
thing for John Lawry that Daily pro
motions are all wound up, for his
rendition of our man Livingston was,
to say the least, vivid. But. then he
works here.
Probably the majority of the au
dience which packed Memorial Hall
last night to see Stanford's non
partisan relief benefit didn't give a
damn who gets the cut—the Finns or
the Firehouse—but they did care
about the caliber of the show they
were going to see.
And they weren't disappointed.
It was a miniature Gaieties, with
out the build-up and slick produc
tion, but with a wit and a sponta
neity that kept the audience in the
aisles despite the fact that the show
indicated that it had been put to
gether in a hurry.
FAGAN FOR THE GAIETIES
Personally we are instituting a
campaign, stalling as of right now,
to put faculty members into Ram's
Head Shows. Our particular nomi
nee is Professor Fagan, who made
the problem of "just where the
money is going" an economic howl.
Marco Thome, replete in swad
dling clothes and an all-day-sucker,
killed a number of deserving, though
hypothetical, adults in a manner
which may nose out his more fa
mous baby killings.
'10 IN PALY RIBBED
The vignette ribbing " '40 in Paly"
was one of the neatest pantomimes
we've seen and Tony Cefaratti and
Thome said more without saying
anything than the whole list of vit
riolic campus opinions.
Two pianos and four musical
screw-balls—Dana Winters, Charlie
Bulotti, Bud Cady and Harry Mu
heim—turned a jam session into a
hilarious 15 minutes, with Muheirii

"Top of the Libc."
