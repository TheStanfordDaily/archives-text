# Cards, Ucla Open Second Hoop Series
## Indians Travel South As Bears, Trojans Meet at Berkeley 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Stanford, U.C.L.A., Southern Cali
fornia and California tonight start
their final stretch drive for the
Southern Division basketball cham
pionship.
Tuning up for their two-game
series with U.S.C. here next week
end, the Indians will make their bid
to stay in the title race when they
meet the Bruins in the Westwood
Pavilion at 8 o'clock tonight and
tomorrow.
CARDS FAVORED
Favored to win their 17th and 18th
straight games from the hapless
Uelans, the Cards are still guarding
against an upset and are taking the
Southerners as seriously as if they
really were a major threat.
A pair of tilts which will attract
more attention than the games in
Los Angeles are on tap for the Bay.
Troy brings up its powerful, crack
basketball contingent to meet the
Bears, a quintet which is 100 per
cunt stronger than the club which
lost to Troy last month.
BEARS MAY SURPRISE
If it is within their means, the
Trojans are going to sew up the title
in this series ... if they do there
won't lie any conference doubts
when they come to Palo Alto next
Friday. However, the odds say that
the Bears are good enough to cop
one of the games—maybe two if luck
is with them.
The Indians' biggest problem down
South will be keeping Jackie Rob
inson from hitting the hoop as often
as he has of late. When the Cards
chopped the Bruins down, 53-38,
and 40-36, last month, Robinson
personally scored 35 points. His fa
vorite trick is to jump into the air
while on the run and then>shoot. As
a result it is going to take some very
smart guarding by Ken Davidson to
keep him from connecting.
STARTING LINE-UPS
Stanford's usual starling five —
Williams, Anderson, Taylor, David
son, and Cowden—will stall one of
the two frays. However, Coach Ev
erett Dean promised that Bob Penn,
lanky soph center and forward, and
Leon Lafaille, senior forward with
the best eye on the squad in long
range shooting, would start one of
the games.
The work of Bob Wcnsel, who
came with Anderson from Modesto
Jaysee, has caught the eye of Dean,
who will shoot him in as first-string
sub for Davidson or Cowden. Wen
sel's floorwork is such that he won't
slow the squad down in its fast
breaking tactics, and his shooting is
above average.
