# Backshop Duo Bosses Shack Behind Scenes
## 
### ROSEMARIE MULLANY 
"Ask Charlie or Bat."
Every once in a while that terse
instruction is tossed over the Daily
editor's desk at a doubting night
editor. It means that a question of
some import is on its way to the
High Appeal in the Shack.
These two are the boys who trans
pose the typewritten sheets chron
icling the campus into the finished
product found the following morn- i
ing in every living group â€” The'
Stanford Daily.
SERVES 17 YEARS
Charlie, who drops the molten j
facts into place on the page, is the -
old guard of the duo. With a 17-
year stretch to look back on, he re
calls the six-column Daily fore
runner, "The Daily Palo Alto."
' Yes, we worked in the daytime
then," he reminisced. "It was a 7 to 4
o'clock shift and the paper was out
right afterwards. Later on when we
moved into this new press building
lit became a full-flledged, eight
column morning paper."
He might have been cut out of the
same pattern as Scattergood Baines,
this Charles Wegner, except that he
has a more active outlook. Many's
ihe night editor who has culled facts
from the silvery haired gent "out
back" on every subject from fishing
to migrant workers. To say nothing
of night editing.
JUNIOR PARTNER'
L. R. Batman, who sits at Ihe
linotype from 4 to 12 o'clock pound
ing the "infernal machine," is the
"junior partner in this tight-knit
corporation with the strong voice in
affairs of The Daily.
"Been here for six years," said Bat,
adjusting the line count on the lino
type. "Gee," he said in an unbe
lieving voice, "that's almost half as
long as Charlie has been working
here."
OBJECTIVE ATTITUDE
While they are both strongly in
terested in The Daily and its start,
they manage to maintain an objec
tive attitude which aids them o#n
! siderably in semi-annual predictions
on Daily elections. If they ever took
it up on a large scale, Mr. Gallup
would have to fold. They seldom
miss.
Copy was coming in from the desk
and Bat settled down into his chair
with the sawed-off legs, jacking up
his speed a little. As we took the
hint and started to leave, he threw a
parting shot:
"That story'd better be good."
