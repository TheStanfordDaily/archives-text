# Olson Defies Coalitionists In Relief Bill Controversy
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO. Feb. IK (UP). —Legislative opponents of Gov. Culhert
Olson tonight discussed additional concessions to he made in regulations
governing the administration of relief to obtain nine more votes needed
for final passage of a $12,200.00(1 appropriation hill to carry the dole to
June 1.

When the temporary relief bill
went to a test vote on Saturday the
count was 45 ayes and 33 against,
while 54 votes are required for the
two-thirds majority to pass an ap
propriation.
WILL TRY AGAIN
The measure -comes up again to
morrow on an administration mo- !
tion for reconsideration, and already :
much-revised relief restrictions will |
be modified further to effect a final I
compromise.
Governor Olson's spokesmen de- i
clared that under no circumstances
will they vote for the appropriation
bill in its present form, which in- '
eludes a $58 per month ceiling, three- |
year residence requirement, ban on '
relief to aliens illegally in this coun- j
try, restriction of political activity
by SRA employes and other tightly- j
woven restrictions.
COMPROMISE ADVISED
Some members of the majority
coalition of anti - administration j
Democrats and Republicans argued i
that the bill should be allowed to !
die — with relief payments lapsing
until another proposal could be
drafted — but leaders of the group
counselled a compromise. Both sides |
held caucuses in preparation for to- •
morrow's crucial session.
Even if final approval is obtained
on the appropriation tomorrow there
may be a few days' delay in distri- !
bution of current relief checks.
SRA Director Walter Chambers
said that payrolls have been pre- j
pared several days in advance on j
the basis of his request for allot
ment of $8,500,000 for March and the
remainder of February.
