# Finland Calls New Troops For Defense
## Russian Air Forces Strike; Mannerheim Line Remains Intact 
### 
HELSINKI. Feb. 18 (UP).â€”The
Finnish government tonight called
to the colors all men between 22
and 4.'5 years of age who for rea
sons of health or other causes had
not had military training, although
today's communique told of a dis
tinct slackening of Russian pres
sure on the revamped Manncr
hcim Line.
News from the fronts indicated
the great Russian "anniversary
drive" against Viipuri had passed its
peak with the Mannerheim Line's
main defenses still intact, but the
Reds struck heavily by air yesterday
and today.
SENI) TO CAMPS
Tonight's government decree called
up for a new examination al! men
of classes from 1897 to 1918. Those
found fit for military service will be
sent to camps, it said. The number
of conscripts from these 22 classes
was expected ' be small, however,
<ts only a small percentage of the
make population has not had nili
tary training and many members of
the classes named have joined the
army already as volunteers.
A Finnish aviation command com
munique said that Russian warplanes
had bombed Viipuri several times
today and again had attacked in the
vicinity of Helsinki. Hyvinkaa,
north of here, and Karjaa, to the
west of Helsinki, also were bombed.
It was not disclosed if there were
casualties.
SOVIET PLANES FALL
Tonight's communique claimed
that 24 Russian planes were shot
down yesterday in raids against Fin
nish population centers, one of the
highest numbers ever claimed for a
single day.
The Russian air force also contin
ued its severe raids against Finnish
Mannerheim Li 'lefonses, the com
munique said
Finns cave I their expanding air
force much of the credit for slow
ing the Russian "anniversary drive"
against Viipuri which for 17 straight
days has pounded at Finnish posi
tions careless of the cost in men and
materials.
FINNISH RAIDS
The Finnish air force, although
vastly outnumbered by the Russians,
raided troop concentrations and sup
ply lines, making it impossible for
the Red forces to maintain the sup
ply of munitions and men necessary
to sustain their drive.
Enemy pressure became weaker
yesterday on the isthmus between
the Gulf of Finland and Vuoski, the
Finnish communique said, and ex
cept for local skirmishes and the
vigorous air activity, the day was
calm.
TANKS DESTROYED
Many enemy tanks were destroyed
and at Taiplake and Suvanto there
was artillery activity as usual, the
communique .said.
Tonight's communique, in which
the critical Koivisto-Vuoski sector
was described as quiet except for
skirmishes, seemed to indicate that
the withdrawal which Field Mar
shal Baron Carl von Mannerheim
executed yesterday was not done
under .severe pressure but. for tac
tical reasons.
The new, heavier defense line
across the "Summa corridor," which
Mannerheim ordered manned yester
day, had been organized to some
depth and was prepared for any new-
Russian challenge, military circles
here said.
