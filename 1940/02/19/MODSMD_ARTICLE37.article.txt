# P.C.C. Quintets Divide Games; Indians Second
## Deanmen Lose To Bruins; Bears Take Troy in First 
### CHUCK SMITH 
The order in the Pacific Coast
Conference basketball race re
mained unchanged despite a week
end in which each team saw the
heights of one victory and the
depths of one defeat during their
two game series.
Coach Everett Dean's Card cagers
poured eight quick points through a
shattered U.C.L.A. defense in the
final minutes of a close game to win
Friday night 51-42. However, on
Saturday night it was the Bruins
that applied on the pressure near

the close of the game, in fact so
late in the game that it was in the
overtime. The regular game ended
with the score tied at 37-37, and the
Bruins managed to hold the Cards
scoreless and to collect 5 points in
the five-minute overtime to win
42-37.
As for individual scoring, Stan
ford's co-captain was the most con
sistent scorer with 10 points the first
game and 11 the second for a total
of 21. Both Forrest Anderson,'ln
dian forward, and Jackie Robinson,
flashy Bruin star, each got the same
total. They each scored 14 points on
the night their respective teams
were winning and were held to only
7 digits while losing.
Meanwhile up at Berkeley, U.S.C.'s
mighty basketball team felt what it
was like to lose for the first time this
year. Not since last year in the play
off of the Coast Conference when
they bowed to Cal's giants in the
same pavilion had the Trojans lost.
Yet. on Friday night Cal's fast im
proving' hoopsters shocked the ex
perts and Trojan Coach Sam Barry
by knocking over the favored south
erners 38-30.
On Saturday night the wrath of
Troy could not be denied and, led
by Ail-American Ralph Vaughn,
U.S.C. swept to a 49-33 victory. Fri
day Mr. Vaughn was kept pretty
well under control by the Bears;
but on the following night he went
wild, scoring 21 points.
Stanford's loss down south re
moved practically all hope of a con
ference title for Everett Dean and
his men. U.S.C. now remains in un
disputed lead of the conference race
â€”three full games away from the
second place Stanford team. It
seems virtually impossible that the
mighty Trojans will lose two games
to Stanford, whom they have beaten
twice, and two to U.C.L.A., whom
they have treated in the same fash
ion.
Next week-end the Indians play
host to the Terrible Trojans.
Whether Everett Dean will alter his
policy and hold practice four times
a week instead of two in prepara
tion for Troy i*emains to be seen.
