# Frosh Five Sparkles in Wins Over Marin, Bronc Freshmen
## 
### 
While tlu* varsity was having its troubles with U.C.L.A. down south, the
Stanford Frosh hung another pair of games on their victory hook over the
week-end as they defeated Marin J.C., 38-30, and the Santa Clara Frosh,
34-25. The two wins marked the Frosh's eleventh and twelfth victories
of tlu i season as against one loss. They were defeated hy Menlo J.C. some

five weeks ago.
Inspired by Marin's impressive
reputation, the Papoose quintet
jumped into a quick 4-1 lead and
stayed in front for the rest of the
game. Starting the second half with
a 3-point margin, the Card yearlings
popped three field goals in hurried
succession, and from there on in it
wasn't even close, with never less
than 8 points separating the two
teams.
For most of the game against
Santa Clara the little Broncos were
in the lead, and with only 10 min
utes to go in the game Stanford was
on the short end of a 24-17 score.
At this point, however, the entire
aspect of the game changed as the
Card frosh started to move like a
whirlwind, ringing up 17 points in
the remaining 10 minutes and hold
ing S.C. to a single free throw.
Leo McCaffrey with 13 points and
Ed Voss with 11 tallies led the Stan
ford scorers in Saturday night's
fray.
With practice called off for today,
the frosh go to work in earnest to
morrow as they prepare for week
end tilts with Modesto J. C. and
Lowell High School.
Twleve of the 34 mineral springs at
Vichy, France, belong to the state.
