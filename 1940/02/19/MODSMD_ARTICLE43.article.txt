# S.C. Out-lucks Card Ruggers
## Trojans Get Breaks, Indians, 10-3 
### 
The Trojans of U.S.C. nut-lucked
the Stanford ruggers in the Colise
um Saturday, and emerged trium
phant, 10-3, in a hard-fought, thrill
ing contest.
S.C.'s first score came late in the
first half when Wood fell on the ball
over the goal while Hugh Gallar
neau, A1 Wool, and Pete Kmetovic
stood by and watched. Beeson con
verted and it was 5-0.
The second Trojan try followed
Tyler's interception of a Stanford
lateral pass, and a hair-raising pass
ing rush that carried 45 yards to the
Indian Â»10 before it was finally
stopped.
The score followed immediately,
when the ball squirted over the Card
goal out of a five-yard scrum With
Jones of S.C. on top of it. Beeson
again converted.
Stanford's lone tally was made
early in the second half when Aub
rey Austin made an angled penalty
kick from 25 yards out good for 3
points.
The most spectacular play of the
game occurred when Gallarneau
pulled a Warner reverse to Kmeto
vic on the 45-yard line. Kmetovic
then dodged, bounced, clawed, and
crawled his way down the sideline
to the Trojan 10, but the scoring
chance missed fire when S.C. was
awarded a penalty kick following a
Stanford offside.
