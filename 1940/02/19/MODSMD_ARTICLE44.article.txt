# Vim to Meet Kenealy Seals Again Today
## Squads Rated Even In Postponed Match Oil Sunken Diamond 
### 
Rained out of their scheduled
game against the McCormack Inde
pendents Saturday, Stanford's var
sity diamondmen will take on ihe
Kenealy Seals this afternoon on the
Sunken Diamond in a tilt postponed
since last Wednesday. There will be
no admission charge, and starting
time will be 3:15 o'clock.
The Seals already hold one win
over the Cards, having copped an
8-7 decision in a game played here
early in the training grind. Last
week the Seals pounded out a 5-3
win over the California Bears.
SEALS TOUGH
Several major league ball players
and some promising minor leaguers
probably will be in the Seals' line
up. Dario Lodigiani of the Philadel
phia Athletics and Babe Dahlgren of
the New York Yankees will make up
one half of the infield at second and
first, respectively.
Ted Jennings, who was made a
free agent Saturday by the San
Francisco Seals, has been holding
down third for the Kenealy club
during the off season.
There is a possibility that Augie
Galan, who performed for Larry Mc-
Phail's Brooklyn Dodgers in the big
show last summer, will hold down
one of the outfield positions for the
Seals. Galan was scheduled to play
last Wednesday.
CARD LINE-UP
Harry Wolter will start what at
present is his first nine. Hal Cos
tello has a strangle hold on the Card
first-base job. Harry Parsons and
fiery Monty Pfvl will be guarding
the keystone sack. Elton Boone will
be on third.
The starting outfield will be made
up of Norm Juney in left, Alec
Cereghino in center, and either Jack
Parsons or Jim Verdieck in right.
Either Claude Purkitt or Russ Smith
will start on the hill, with Sid Lewis
or Jack Randall on the receiving
end.
