### 
The Stanford freshman swimmers
lost their first meet of the season
when they were nosed out .38-36 by
the combined freshman and varsity
swimmers of San Francisco State
College here Saturday.
As at past meets, Stanford's mer
men were kept in the meet by the
outstanding work of Don Smith and
Bayard Colyear. These two boys
were elected co-captains of this
year's Papoose team immediately
preceeding the meet.
