### FRANK GUTHRIE 
lERRY MAYER, my sports boss!
!** last volume, has just cleared out
l his set of three drawers and given
j me the Yale to the 10-by-20-foot
l sports office.
Over in the far corner, they've i
stuck an Underwood on which (tor i
| some Gawd-awful number of hours a
day) I'll be banging away, turning
| out what I hope will be some inter- j
i esting columns. I'll be working un-
I der the -same difficulties the three
I previous sports editors must have
j had when they racked their brains i
j for column fodder.
Comrade Mayer warned me that i
j it wouldn't be an easy job. Ye pres
j ent editor Arch Jenkins probably
J told Jerry the same thing. John
Shallenberger, now in Harvard's j
j business school, undoubtedly had a
I word with Arch.
* * *
As nervous as a horse in the Santa !
Anita "Hundred Grand Handicap, v I
have to sit here with pictures of j
some of (he Farm's famous athletes
frowning down upon me. I wonder
what they're thinking? Methinks
| Mayer, Jenkins, and Shallenberger '
! probably looked upon them and
j tried to out-stare them as I'm doing
i now.
* sic *
On the wall there are a good !
, dozen pictures. Reading from right j
| to left, there is Hank Luisetti tak- j
i ing a shower after a strenuous ball |
1 game on the court. Slants will con- J
| tinue to prod Ex Committee (if they
; need prodding) about putting Hank's j
| No. 7 away for posterity.
Claude E. (Tiny) Thornhill, for 1
I seven years head man of the In
j dian grid affairs until alumni wolves
| helped the B.A.C. dismiss him,
i smiles benevolently down upon me.
\ He looks as if ho were thinking of
j better days. Upside down is a pix
j of Cal's Top Sarge, Stub Allison.
Bobby Grayson, of vow boy'
j fame, Ben Winkleman, ex-line coach
; and recently appointed San Jose
I State mentor to succeed Dud De-
Groot, and Bill Paulman, 1938 grid
j der and now playing rugby for the
; University Club, are directly in
i front of me. Grant Stone, 1937 end,
j is there too.
* *
pRED LEDEBOER, the three-posi
| tion backfield man in '38, is mak-
I ing a face out on the practice field.
I Dink Templeton, the former boy
i wonder track coach who resigned
; last fall, surveys the field grimly—
j probably watching his protege, Clyde
I Jeffrey, running a blitzkrieg "hun
: dred."

Over to the left Ken Davidson,
co-captain of the basketball club
with Don Williams, is placed
alongside of Harlan Copsey, for
ward on last year's club. David
son is Coach Everett Dean's nom
inee for the best all-around
guard in the Southern Division.
Further over is Tony Calvelli,
who played center for the Detroit
Lions in the pro league last fall and
now is taking graduate work in the
education school. By West of '38
grid eleven is below him. Remem
ber he topped off his varsity career
by scoring a touchdown against
Dartmouth? And he was a tackle,
too.
All by themselves way over are
four athletes, two of whom we'll re
member quite a while. Stan Ander
son, football captain last fall,
threatens to throw the 16-pound
shot out of the lot every time he
picks it up these days. He's the
backbone of Coach Bill Ellington's
weight squad. Then there is Pete
Zagar, '38 all-Coast tackle and
N.C.2A. discus champ, who was as
sistant frosh football coach last fall.
Billy Kirsch and Bob Dakan, '38
halfback and guard are alongside.

with Don Williams, is placed
alongside of Harlan Copsey, for
ward on last year's club. David
son is Coach Everett Dean's nom
inee for the best all-around
guard in the Southern Division.
Further over is Tony Calvelli,
who played center for the Detroit
Lions in the pro league last fall and
now is taking graduate work in the
education school. By West of '38
grid eleven is below him. Remem
ber he topped off his varsity career
by scoring a touchdown against
Dartmouth? And he was a tackle,
too.
All by themselves way over are
four athletes, two of whom we'll re
member quite a while. Stan Ander
son, football captain last fall,
threatens to throw the 16-pound
shot out of the lot every time he
picks it up these days. He's the
backbone of Coach Bill Ellington's
weight squad. Then there is Pete
Zagar, '38 all-Coast tackle and
N.C.2A. discus champ, who was as
sistant frosh football coach last fall.
Billy Kirsch and Bob Dakan, '38
halfback and guard are alongside.
lERRY MAYER, my sports boss!
!** last volume, has just cleared out
l his set of three drawers and given
j me the Yale to the 10-by-20-foot
l sports office.
Over in the far corner, they've i
stuck an Underwood on which (tor i
| some Gawd-awful number of hours a
day) I'll be banging away, turning
| out what I hope will be some inter- j
i esting columns. I'll be working un-
I der the -same difficulties the three
I previous sports editors must have
j had when they racked their brains i
j for column fodder.
Comrade Mayer warned me that i
j it wouldn't be an easy job. Ye pres
j ent editor Arch Jenkins probably
J told Jerry the same thing. John
Shallenberger, now in Harvard's j
j business school, undoubtedly had a
I word with Arch.

As nervous as a horse in the Santa !
Anita "Hundred Grand Handicap, v I
have to sit here with pictures of j
some of (he Farm's famous athletes
frowning down upon me. I wonder
what they're thinking? Methinks
| Mayer, Jenkins, and Shallenberger '
! probably looked upon them and
j tried to out-stare them as I'm doing
i now.

On the wall there are a good !
, dozen pictures. Reading from right j
| to left, there is Hank Luisetti tak- j
i ing a shower after a strenuous ball |
1 game on the court. Slants will con- J
| tinue to prod Ex Committee (if they
; need prodding) about putting Hank's j
| No. 7 away for posterity.
Claude E. (Tiny) Thornhill, for 1
I seven years head man of the In
j dian grid affairs until alumni wolves
| helped the B.A.C. dismiss him,
i smiles benevolently down upon me.
\ He looks as if ho were thinking of
j better days. Upside down is a pix
j of Cal's Top Sarge, Stub Allison.
Bobby Grayson, of vow boy'
j fame, Ben Winkleman, ex-line coach
; and recently appointed San Jose
I State mentor to succeed Dud De-
Groot, and Bill Paulman, 1938 grid
j der and now playing rugby for the
; University Club, are directly in
i front of me. Grant Stone, 1937 end,
j is there too.

pRED LEDEBOER, the three-posi
| tion backfield man in '38, is mak-
I ing a face out on the practice field.
I Dink Templeton, the former boy
i wonder track coach who resigned
; last fall, surveys the field grimly—
j probably watching his protege, Clyde
I Jeffrey, running a blitzkrieg "hun
: dred."
