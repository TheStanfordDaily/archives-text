# Dear Larry . . .
## 
### 
THIS goodbye and hello procedure between
the old and new department heads on The
Daily has come to be as much a tradition as
any practice that the Farm has to offer.
And while you know by now that I am far
from being a sentimental cuss, I still hesitate to
put an end to one of the few remaining sym
bolisms that we have preserved. Smoke rings
waft upward from the Quad sanctuary and the
daughters of rich and independent capitalists
coyly walk up and down the Law steps with
seldom a boo to thwart their efforts. The Roughs
are wearing fifteen-dollar slacks, too, and it
takes a fellow with a hypnotic thumb to beg a
ride in from Paly.
But a couple of seniors like you and me must
like Stanford pretty well to put in four years of
effort in a little two-by-four wooden building,
with only the barest chances of ever reaching
a position of comparative importance. Certain
it is that both of us would go on just about the
same trail if we had it all to do over again.
After all the presentations and little speeches
the other night, I think you know how the hun
dred of us feel about your volume. Just give
me the same ovation in June that they gave you
and I'll be the happiest kid in the Class of '40.
* ★ ★
people have already asked me
1 > v out policy. "Was Livingston right in de
' .a- ig a program of neutral relief in prefer
to aid to one belligerent nation?" "Are
conna give the A.S.U. a break in The
Daily?" and "Why don't you do something
about that damned Board of Athletic Control?"
Well, that's a sample of what I mean. Come
to think of it, maybe you yourself have a few
questions about the plans of this new weapon
that you've turned over to me. How does this
sound to you?
1. I hate Communism but the A.S.U., the
Don't-Send-Bridges-Back-to-Australia Club, and
all the rest may rabble all they want so long as
they don't tread on the toes of our collective
Stanford.
2. Stanford is not the best of all possible uni
versities; yet it is one of the best and as such
demands an open student mind and the same
break from the undergraduates that the under
graduates consistently demand of it.
3. The Administration has made and will
make more mistakes, just as you know I will
do. The Daily, as in the Finnish relief question,
will always try to side with student opinion and
to work problems out to a sensible solution,
with no aspects of either faction's desires being
withheld.
4. The Daily will discourage all alumni of the
perpetual sophomore breed from meddling in
the affairs of either the Board of Athletic Con
trol or the administration proper. Loyal and im
partial support from the outside, on the other
hand, will be encouraged and applauded.
5. Student government must certainly be
preserved; still that can be effected without
resort to an Inquisition or a bunch of little Dies
Committees. Doesn't it seem to you that we say
a whale of a lot for men of our age and expe
rience, most of us still dependent on others
for our food and clothing?
We never used to threaten a purge on our
Moms and Pops when they sent us to bed with
out any supper. We went to bed.
S3 don't worry about ole '97, Larry. If 96
other editors made the grade, it's pretty
logical that we'll get by okeh—unless one of
our mutual antagonists drops a little round bomb
under the Shack.
And that ain't legal.

S3 don't worry about ole '97, Larry. If 96

THIS goodbye and hello procedure between
the old and new department heads on The
Daily has come to be as much a tradition as
any practice that the Farm has to offer.
And while you know by now that I am far
from being a sentimental cuss, I still hesitate to
put an end to one of the few remaining sym
bolisms that we have preserved. Smoke rings
waft upward from the Quad sanctuary and the
daughters of rich and independent capitalists
coyly walk up and down the Law steps with
seldom a boo to thwart their efforts. The Roughs
are wearing fifteen-dollar slacks, too, and it
takes a fellow with a hypnotic thumb to beg a
ride in from Paly.
But a couple of seniors like you and me must
like Stanford pretty well to put in four years of
effort in a little two-by-four wooden building,
with only the barest chances of ever reaching
a position of comparative importance. Certain
it is that both of us would go on just about the
same trail if we had it all to do over again.
After all the presentations and little speeches
the other night, I think you know how the hun
dred of us feel about your volume. Just give
me the same ovation in June that they gave you
and I'll be the happiest kid in the Class of '40.

people have already asked me

' .a- ig a program of neutral relief in prefer
to aid to one belligerent nation?" "Are
conna give the A.S.U. a break in The
Daily?" and "Why don't you do something
about that damned Board of Athletic Control?"
Well, that's a sample of what I mean. Come
to think of it, maybe you yourself have a few
questions about the plans of this new weapon
that you've turned over to me. How does this
sound to you?
1. I hate Communism but the A.S.U., the
Don't-Send-Bridges-Back-to-Australia Club, and
all the rest may rabble all they want so long as
they don't tread on the toes of our collective
Stanford.
2. Stanford is not the best of all possible uni
versities; yet it is one of the best and as such
demands an open student mind and the same
break from the undergraduates that the under
graduates consistently demand of it.
3. The Administration has made and will
make more mistakes, just as you know I will
do. The Daily, as in the Finnish relief question,
will always try to side with student opinion and
to work problems out to a sensible solution,
with no aspects of either faction's desires being
withheld.
4. The Daily will discourage all alumni of the
perpetual sophomore breed from meddling in
the affairs of either the Board of Athletic Con
trol or the administration proper. Loyal and im
partial support from the outside, on the other
hand, will be encouraged and applauded.
5. Student government must certainly be
preserved; still that can be effected without
resort to an Inquisition or a bunch of little Dies
Committees. Doesn't it seem to you that we say
a whale of a lot for men of our age and expe
rience, most of us still dependent on others
for our food and clothing?
We never used to threaten a purge on our
Moms and Pops when they sent us to bed with
out any supper. We went to bed.
