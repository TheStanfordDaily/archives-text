r rifE EDITOR, SIR:
I have a bone to pick with Friday's article on the
relief benefit held Thursday night.
(> ranted that Mr. Fagan was good, that Marco
rhorne was good, that Excom members needed a little
ribbing, and that the four piano players showed off
thein well developed egos to good advantage, but WHY
didn't the article mention that two people, both famous
in their fields, were kind enough to contribute to the
entertainment

The applause that greeted Dr. Trueblood's good
natured little speech and Mr. Ferenc Molnar's beau
tiful music should have convinced the reviewer that
they were also "worthy" of comment.
