EDITOR, SIR.
I am an opponent of cigarette smoking. I have
always been so. When I see students of Leland Stan
ford Junior Et Cetera University dragging themselves
down, it grieves me.
I refer to a letter written by a "Smoking Joseph"
which appeared this morning in your columns. He
refers facetiously to his grandmother who died "at the
age of 103." He claims the dear old lady was pregnant
at the time. We can dismiss this as pure twaddle. Jo
seph, if this be his x - eal name, then cites as reference
one Ambrose and Smith, "Life Expectancy." There is,
I can safely assert, no such book. I looked it up this
morning. The nearest to it is a J. N. Ambrose and R. L.
Snitley, "Improved Techniques in Date Growing in the
Coachella Valley," 1923 (Document Division.) I am
sure this is NOT the publication to which Joseph
refers.
I point in turn to a very real bookâ€”"Drugs and the
Human Body," published in 1935 by Cawther Brothers
and written by Pearse, Thomasin, and Falconer. On
page 243 (Chapter on The Cigarette, Vice and Preten
sion), the authors declare, "The pernicious indulgence
in cigarettes in the city of Pedsburg (Ok.) alone (1933
figures) exceeded the total amount spent in kasbirs
for lettuce in Istanbul, foreign section, in the fall of
1928."
I trust friend Joseph will read this and think deeply
on the subject. To me it is a crime to see Stanford
students ruining themselves, and then laughing it off.
Healthfully yours,
"Against Drugs"
