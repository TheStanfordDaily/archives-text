BOLSHEVISM REARS ITS UGLY HEAD
/"kVER the U.P. wires yesterday came a sensational
story about collegiate radicalism. The student
body of Young Harris College in Georgia was up in
arms. Like united brothers of the proletariat they
picketed the administrative powers-that-be.
When the faculty tried to exploit student labor by
banning smoking, drinking, dancing, gambling, card
playing, and outside dates, the Young College broth
erhood suffered in silence. But when President T. Jack
Lance outlawed bi-sexual hand-holding two hundred
and fifty students struck.
The outraged young strikers finally had to capitu
late to bourgeois terms, however, when the President
announced, "This is one institution where the faculty
will not brook bolshevism."
Thank God and my philosophy professor for the
relativist theory of value. Now we can more fully
appreciate the comparatively libertine environment of
Stanford University. If Young Harris College is the
standard, Farm students are debauchers with every
cigarette consumed (on or off the Quad). And little
did we suspect that the Cactus Gardens are a hot-bed
of bolshevism.

JJUT it seems to me that this unflinching defender of
the faith down in Georgia is really using the
wrong methods to attack the Internationale. If hand
holders are bolshevists, how can we expect to keep the
world safe for democracy? Far from stamping out
Communism, this anti-hand-holding campaign is go
ing to encourage even more radical sects and parties.
The share-the-hands bolshevists are bad enough.
But wait until Young College has kissing anarchists
to deal with, and out and out necking nihilists. Rad
icalism will groiv by leaps and bounds as it becomes
progressively more alluring.
Of course, President T. Jack Lance will not be
caught unpreparedâ€”even if he is caught without any
students. He will no doubt institute a stringent pro
gram to curb such immoral signs of delinquency as
the absolutely naked faces of college women. And
the shameful practice of singing will go the way of all
savageiy. Anyone caught humming "The Man that
Comes Around," of course, will be turned over to the
Dies Committee, if he escapes hanging.
If all this is bolshevism, we are really in a sad state
of revolution. But it is much more likely that Thomas
Jefferson held hands at the University of Virginia,
and that T. Jack Lance is paid by Joe Stalin to be
paint the head of bolshevism with sinister charms.
