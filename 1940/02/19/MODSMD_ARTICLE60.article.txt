# Hedy Lusciously Ludicrous In Turgid Dramatic Effort

"I TAKE THIS WOMAN," now
playing at the Stanford.
"Time wounds all Heels" or "I
Take This Woman - ' stars Spencer
Tracy and Hedy Lamarr with Verree
Teasdale holding up Tracy, and both
of them holding up the picture. It
was good comedy.
Comedy in the picture was sup
plied by quick-witted Miss Teasdale,
who rushed about New York selling
expensive clothes and "scotching"
Phil Mayberry, played by Kent Tay
lor, the above-mentioned "heel."
TRACY STRUGGLES
The part played by Tracy was not
up to the standard set by him in
"Captains Courageous" but he fought
well against the almost insurmount
able odds of poor plot and lines.
The story is one of a young doc
tor who, while returning home from
the tropics, prevents a young lady
from committing suicide and then
sets about to mend her heart as one

j would a broken leg.
Tracy, the young doctor, estab
, lished his mastery over Miss La
i marr in the opening scenes by
knocking her out, and he held his
1 mastery throughout the picture.
In his quiet way he talks Miss
Lamarr into some common sense
| and self-confidence only to renounce
i her.
Tracy, happy in his Eastside
clinic reaches high to become the
partner of a successful but poor so
ciety doctor so that his wife, Miss
[ Lamarr, might keep her position in
the "cafe society."
AUDIENCE LAUGHS
Not used to pure glamour and no
degree of either acting ability or
stage presence, the audience laughed
at Miss Lamarr when she tried to do
her best, but she was funny at her
best.
The newsreel was good anyhow.—

MANZANILLO, Mexico, Feb. 18
(UP). —Arrival of ship cargoes des
tined for Russian ports gave fur
ther evidence today that this once
quiet Mexican harbor has become
an important American base for
shipment of war supplies and food
to support the Soviet war with Fin
land.
