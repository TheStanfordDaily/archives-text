# Final Attitude Tests Offered
## Last Junior Psych Test Due This Week 
### 
Attitude interest tests will be of- j
fered tonight, tomorrow night, and <
Wednesday for all juniors who en- j
tered Stanford in 1937 and did not
take the test last quarter.
Testing will take place in Room
100 between 7:30 and 9:30 o'clock;
students may come at any time j
between these hours. The complete j
tests will last. 38 minutes.
Bob Morris, who is conducting the I
tests for the psychology department, â– 
urges all those juniors who have I
not repeated the tests to do so, as!
complete results are necessary to!
make the tests valid.
The tests were given all freshmen j
in 1937 and are being repeated to j
determine the transition of attitudes :
and interests of students after two j
years at Stanford.
There are still 108 men and 8!
women who have not repeated the 1
tests, and Morris emphasized that, it |
is important to get the results of !
these students, as they probably
have different attitudes and inter
ests than those who repeated the I
tests last quarter.
