### WILSON CANNON 
YESTERDAY President Roosevelt,
aboard the U.S.N, cruiser Tus
caloosa, was fishing "somewhere off
(he coast of Florida"; but whether
he was angling for promises of
peace in Europe or for swordfish,
reporters still did not know.
And while Franklin D. basked in
the Florida sun in a cruise which
since his departure three days ago
has been veiled in secrecy, the Nor
wegian press frantically urged that
he be placed at the head of an arbi
tration court of neutral experts to
decide the rights of the German
prison ship Altmark case.
(The case in question involves the
recent capture and grounding of the
Altmark in neutral waters off Nor
way by a British cruiser. Following
the capture 326 Briton prisoners
were removed and taken back to
England.)
Nazi Germany, furious over the
incident, has fired one diplomatic
barrage after another at the Scan
dinavian nation. Britain, in her
turn, has made Norway the target
of all War Ministry broadsides.
Both warring powers blamed Nor
way alone in connection with the
affair, which grows steadily in
magnitude.
Those officials who back the plan
to put Roosevelt in charge of a
court of mediation are quoted as
believing that both Germany and
England would accept the proposal.
Should either nation refuse to par
ticipate, it would be taken as an
admission of guilt, they claim.

B UT „ Foreign Minister Koht, who
called the Norwegian Parlia
ment in special session in a fran
tic attempt to "prevent the incident
from drawing this country" and per
haps all Scandinavia, into the west
ern conflict, was not so sure.
Fearing that Hitler would never
consent to submit arbitration to the
head of a neutral felt to be in sym
pathy with the Allied cause, the
Norwegian Foreign Minister last
night advised Germany that they
intend to submit the Altmark inci
dent to the League of Nations. Al
though no official reply was re
ceived, Germans close to Der Fueh
rer indicated that the memorandum
was couched in a "satisfactory"
tone.
And while the neutral nation of
Norway shivered beneath the
blasts of diplomatic ire, one more
neutral power, this time on what
may soon become the "Southern
Front," moved drastically last
night as the Turkish government
decided to enforce the national de
fense law, which will mean virtual
dictatorial powers for the cabinet.
* * *
Confirming the strategy of the re
cent Allied move which sent a re
serve force of 500,000 French and
Anzaes to the Mediterranean area,
the Turkish government - controlled
press warned that the decision
means the foreign situation is such
that Turkey must be prepared for
any eventuality . . . including
"drastic action."
A short time ago, on the eve of
the recent Balkan Entente, Turkey
plainly let it be known that it was
not neutral but considered itself a
non-belligerent ally of Britain and
France. Last night this policy was
reaffirmed by official statement
which claimed all action was neces
sitated by the German attitude
toward the Balkans.
Newspapers openly warned Ber
lin that Germany has no chance
of maneuvering Turkey into a po
sit ion of complete neutrality lie
cause that country "considers it
to be Turkey's duty" to make ev
ery effort to assure a final Allied
victory.

YESTERDAY President Roosevelt,
aboard the U.S.N, cruiser Tus

he was angling for promises of
peace in Europe or for swordfish,

And while Franklin D. basked in
the Florida sun in a cruise which
since his departure three days ago
has been veiled in secrecy, the Nor
wegian press frantically urged that
he be placed at the head of an arbi
tration court of neutral experts to
decide the rights of the German
prison ship Altmark case.
(The case in question involves the
recent capture and grounding of the
Altmark in neutral waters off Nor
way by a British cruiser. Following
the capture 326 Briton prisoners
were removed and taken back to
England.)
Nazi Germany, furious over the
incident, has fired one diplomatic
barrage after another at the Scan
dinavian nation. Britain, in her
turn, has made Norway the target
of all War Ministry broadsides.
Both warring powers blamed Nor
way alone in connection with the
affair, which grows steadily in
magnitude.
Those officials who back the plan
to put Roosevelt in charge of a
court of mediation are quoted as
believing that both Germany and
England would accept the proposal.
Should either nation refuse to par

admission of guilt, they claim.
