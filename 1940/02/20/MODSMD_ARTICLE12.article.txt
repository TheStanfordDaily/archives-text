# Holtom Names Casts of Two One Act Plays
## 
### 
Casts of two of the three Ram's
Head one-act plays to be given
March 8 and 9 in the Little Theater
were announced last night by Dan
Holtom, director, along with the an
nouncement of several change in the
production plans.
The cast for "Saturday Night" is
as follows: Kay, Yvonne Hazlett;
Paula, Bobbe Harris; Ginny, Jean
Nowell; Carolyn, Kay Anderson;
Sue, Barbara Lombard; Dotty, Joan
Woodard; and Mary Jay, Barbara
Hebron. Gloria Workman, author of
the play, presents a remarkably ac
curate and realistic cross-section of
sorority life, according to Holtom.
TITLE CHANGED
"Meet Mr. Smith" is the new
name for Bud Cady's prize-winning
play, which was originally entitled
"Mr. Jones Goes to Dinner." The
cast includes: Charles Bulotti as Mr.
Jones; Louise Goldman as Mrs.
Jones; Mel Mack, Mr. Smith; Tony
Cefaratti, Mr. B. O. Smith; and
Harry Muheim as Smith.
"Meet Mr. Smith" has been char
acterized as a comedy of line and
situation by the Ram's Head produc
tion staff. A glimpse of Cady's rec
ord in campus dramatics emphasizes
his capabilities in the humorous line.
He was long a mainstay of Gaieties
and Spring Show casts and has col
laborated on past Ram's Head pro
ductions.
ALLEN REVISES SCENE
The revised final scene of Ted Hat
len's play, "We Shall Not Sleep,"
will be air-mailed from the Uni
versity of Idaho, where Hatlen has
joined the teaching staff of the Eng
lish and Drama departments. The
script is expected in time for final
tryouts Wednesday.
Tryouts for "We Shall Not Sleep"
will be held today in Room 125 in
Memorial Theater. The complete
casting will be announced as soon
as production plans are completed.
