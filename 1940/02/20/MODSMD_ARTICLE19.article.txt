# Johansen Plans Somber Setting In English Play
## 'George, Margaret' Comedy Emphasized By Dull, Dark Colors 
### 
To emphasize the light-hearted
comedy mood of "George and Mar
garet," famous English play sched
uled for production in the little the
ater of Memorial Hall on February
26, 28, 29, and March 1, 2, Waldemar
i Johansen, technical director, has
planned two interiors in the somber
I mood of the tragedy.
According to Johansen, the dark
greens he is using in the living
i room interior will point up the play's
â–  inconsequential feeling. In the din
-1 ing room set, he does an artistic
I about face and the scene blazes out
! in salmon pink.
j The two sets depict a pleasant
I middleclass home which is not quite
'in the London suburbs. The at
j mosphere is homelike and with
| something of the "You Can't Take
1 It with You" about, it.
Only problem which has cropped
' up during this show has been the
i matter of making sets for the little
! theater which look solid, at the same
! time being easily moved.
Because the technical aspects of
J this play are negligible when com
j pared with the last production,
"Warrior's Husband," Johansen has
j found time to hold a one-man
water-color show at the Paul Elder
Galleries in San Francisco.
Tickets for "George and Margaret"
are 50 cents and they may be re
served by telephoning Mr. Barker,
secretary of the Division of Speech
j and Drama at P.A. 22041.
