port, revealed their ship was cut in
two by a German torpedo and they
rode the stern half for four days
before they were rescued by a
British warship. Two men were
drowned.
"We saw nothing of the submarine
until there was a terrific explosion
and we found the ship completely
cut in two and rapidly drifting
apart," a survivor said. "We took to
the boats but saw that the stem half
was still afloat, whereupon we re
turned and found the engines still
workable although half a ship was
hard to manage and we drifted a
lot."

Forty survivors of the 8,022-ton
British tanker Imperial Transport,
who landed yesterday at a Scottish
port, revealed their ship was cut in
two by a German torpedo and they
rode the stern half for four days
before they were rescued by a
British warship. Two men were
drowned.
"We saw nothing of the submarine
until there was a terrific explosion
and we found the ship completely
cut in two and rapidly drifting
apart," a survivor said. "We took to
the boats but saw that the stem half
was still afloat, whereupon we re
turned and found the engines still
workable although half a ship was
hard to manage and we drifted a
lot."
