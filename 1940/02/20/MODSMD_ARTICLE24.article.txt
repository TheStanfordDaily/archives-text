# S.P.U. Decides 'No Third Term'
## 
### 
With only 14 people attending the
meeting last night, the Stanford Po
litical Union decided against a third
term for Rooseelt by the narrow
margin of one vote.
The labor party was split open by
the question of whether or not the
benefit received by labor from the
President's public works projects
were great enough to offset the harm
caused by legislation which "ap
parently lacked a unifying purpose."
Liberals maintained that there is
no other man on the American scene
who can do any better than Roose
velt. They condemned Taft because
of his approval of the calling out of
the state militia to break an Ohio
strike.
The conservatives maintained that
the United States needs a man who
puts administration before political
policy. They did not name such a
man, however.
