# junior Psych Tests Continue
## Attitude Quizzes End Tomorrow Evening 
### 
The psychology department will
continue to offer the attitude-inter- |
est tests tonight and tomorrow night
| to all juniors who entered Stanford
I in 1937 and did not repeat the test I
I last quarter.
Testing will be in Room 100 be- i
! tween 7:30 and 9:30 o'clock; stu
i dents may come at any time during
| these hours to take the test, which
' lasts for 38 minutes.
In 1937 all freshmen took this test,
| and the repetition of it is an effort'
jto understand student attitudes,]
j problems, and interests, and to have 1
j an understanding of changes in these
' attitudes after two years at Stan- 1
j ford.
To insure valid results, every jun
l ior who took the test in 1937 must
! repeat it, according to Bob Morris,'
in charge of the testing.
