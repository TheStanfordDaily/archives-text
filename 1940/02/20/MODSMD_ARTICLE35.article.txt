# Stanford Hams' Contact 130 Stations
## 
### 
One hundred and thirty amateur ]
radio stations in 29 states were con
tacted by the Stanford Radio Club
during the 20 hours preceding mid
night. Sunday.
Taking part in a nationwide com
petition against many of the 15.000
American "hams," the local organi
zation piled up what is believed may
be a new Pacific Coast record as well
as a high national score. In a simi
lar contest held a year ago, the
Farm "hams" managed to win third
place from all competing stations
west of the Mississippi.
Accomplishments of the radio
club's station have been considered
outstanding because of the handicaps
under which it is operated. First , the
station uses a wave-length close to
public broadcasting stations which is
generally considered useful for
distances of but a few hundred
miles. Secondly, a position on the
edge of the continent doesn't give
the advantages of a more centrally
located position.

| However, in this contest, stations
as far away as New York, Massa
chusetts, and Connecticut were con
-1 tacled.
The Stanford Radio Club recently
reorganized in order that its A.S.S.U. j
I charter be retained. Mike Villard,
elected president, immediately be
gan preparations for the contest.
These plans included stringing a
i half-mile-long antenna among the
1 120-ft. high towers of the Ryan
High Voltage Laboratory.
The club's transmitter, which ra- !
diates enough "energy" to light an j
average house, is located a mile and
! a half southeast of the campus near
the Ryan Laboratory.
Fifteen students, all government
licensed amateur operators and radio
; club members, operate the station.
Most of them are studying electrical
i engineering.
The recent contest was sponsored
by the American Radio Relay
| League with national headquarters
in Hartford, Conn. This is the parent

organization which co-ordinates the
work of "ham" operators through
out the United States. Individual re
ports from the various stations tak
ing part in the contest were sent in
to the league, the results to be issued
as soon as a full tabulation is
made.

; club members, operate the station.
Most of them are studying electrical

The recent contest was sponsored
by the American Radio Relay
| League with national headquarters
in Hartford, Conn. This is the parent

organization which co-ordinates the
work of "ham" operators through
out the United States. Individual re
ports from the various stations tak
ing part in the contest were sent in
to the league, the results to be issued
as soon as a full tabulation is
made.
One hundred and thirty amateur ]
radio stations in 29 states were con
tacted by the Stanford Radio Club
during the 20 hours preceding mid
night. Sunday.
Taking part in a nationwide com
petition against many of the 15.000
American "hams," the local organi
zation piled up what is believed may
be a new Pacific Coast record as well
as a high national score. In a simi
lar contest held a year ago, the
Farm "hams" managed to win third
place from all competing stations
west of the Mississippi.
Accomplishments of the radio
club's station have been considered
outstanding because of the handicaps
under which it is operated. First , the
station uses a wave-length close to
public broadcasting stations which is
generally considered useful for
distances of but a few hundred
miles. Secondly, a position on the
edge of the continent doesn't give
the advantages of a more centrally
located position.

| However, in this contest, stations
as far away as New York, Massa
chusetts, and Connecticut were con
-1 tacled.
The Stanford Radio Club recently
reorganized in order that its A.S.S.U. j
I charter be retained. Mike Villard,
elected president, immediately be
gan preparations for the contest.
These plans included stringing a
i half-mile-long antenna among the
1 120-ft. high towers of the Ryan
High Voltage Laboratory.
The club's transmitter, which ra- !
diates enough "energy" to light an j
average house, is located a mile and
! a half southeast of the campus near
the Ryan Laboratory.
Fifteen students, all government
licensed amateur operators and radio
; club members, operate the station.
Most of them are studying electrical
i engineering.
