DID YOU KNOW . . .
That Stanford's cagers really were
connecting against the Bruins last
Friday night in their field goals?
Figures compiled during the game
showed that just about every other
ball Davidson, Williams, and com
pany tossed at the basket was good
for two digits.
It was 4(i per cent to he exact,
with 23 out of 51 shots from the
floor going through the hoop.
That's just about I<> more per
centage points above an average
evening's work. Even the Bruins
—usually the coldest quintet—had
a good evening with Hi baskets out
of 45 attempts.
Coach Dean, however, once coach
ed an Indiana U. team which used
a delayed offensive—nothing like the
present fast break—against Michi
gan and it sank 11 of 21 shots from
the floor.

WHILE TALKING BASKETBALL
Did you know that the Indians
lost Saturday's hall game on their
inability to connect from the foul
throw line? The club led 10-13 in
field goals at the end of the regu
lar game time, hut had sunk only
5 out of 14 charity throws—one
more would have she" them a
victory instead <if an overtime
defeat.

COACH EVERETT DEAN . . .
Got a real gift the other day, when
Don Spencer, who promoted the
Baltimore double-header during
Christmas vacation in which the In
dian cagers took part, sent him a
gold pocket watch. By the way, the
boys had one of their toughest early
season games with Baltimore, barely
winning, 54-50.

PERHAPS YOU SAW . . .
Where four Farm cindermen ran
the mile relay in 3:15.7 the other
day. Those who know track prob
ably appreciate that time more than
others. When you stop to consider
that the world's record set by
U.S.C. a couple of years ago is only
four second away, then it looks
pretty promising that Jeffrey, Hyde,
Clark, and Williamson will be flirt
ing with that record by May.
Jeff ran 47.7 in that relay, so we
know what lie can do. But don't
think for an instant that William
sen and Clark who ran it in 4!)
seconds aren't going to he a sec
ond or so better themselves when
they really get in shape. Hyde,
who also has run the half-mile,
can he counted upon for at least
a high 48-second race.
All the interest that was attracted
last year in the twilight meets should
\yc increased tremendously this win
ter, what with Bill Ellington coach
ing what is considered the best Farm
cinder team in many years.
