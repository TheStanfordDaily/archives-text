# El Tore Downs Theta Xi, 20-17
## Frank Walt Sparks Winners to Victory 
### 
Before one of the largest and most
enthusiastic crowds seen at intra
murals, the powerful El Toro five
hung tenaciously to a small lead and
registered a hard-fought 20-17 win
over Theta Xi.
The winners set up their air-tight
defense and smothered Theta Xi for
the better part of the game. Only
toward the last few minutes did the
losers get moving and this was
mainly due to two long loop shots
by Hugh O'Donnell.
For the winners quiet Frank Walt
proved to be the offensive spark
plug. He pushed through 6 field
goals for 12 points and Bob Morton
hit for 7.
In another hot game, the Breakers
put on a last-minute rally to win
over Kappa Sigma 25-23. The Break
ers jumped to a 14-7 lead at half
time and seemed to have the game
on ice, but Kappa Sigma came out
in the second half fighting mad and
poured through baskets to lead 23-
20 with a minute to go. Here the
Breakers pulled their rally and
clinched the game.
The outstanding man on the floor
was diminutive Bruce Clark, whose
fiery floor game was superb and
who led the scorers with 13 points.

Before one of the largest and most
enthusiastic crowds seen at intra
murals, the powerful El Toro five
hung tenaciously to a small lead and
registered a hard-fought 20-17 win
over Theta Xi.
The winners set up their air-tight
defense and smothered Theta Xi for
the better part of the game. Only
toward the last few minutes did the
losers get moving and this was
mainly due to two long loop shots
by Hugh O'Donnell.
For the winners quiet Frank Walt
proved to be the offensive spark
plug. He pushed through 6 field
goals for 12 points and Bob Morton
hit for 7.
In another hot game, the Breakers
put on a last-minute rally to win
over Kappa Sigma 25-23. The Break
ers jumped to a 14-7 lead at half
time and seemed to have the game
on ice, but Kappa Sigma came out
in the second half fighting mad and
poured through baskets to lead 23-
20 with a minute to go. Here the
Breakers pulled their rally and
clinched the game.
The outstanding man on the floor
was diminutive Bruce Clark, whose
fiery floor game was superb and
who led the scorers with 13 points.
