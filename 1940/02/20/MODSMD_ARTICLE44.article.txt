# Dean Blames Cagers' Slump On Free Throws, Defense
## 
### 
| Coach Everett Dean divided the .
| blame for the slump which has I
j dropped Stanford's cagers from the j
| position of potential Coast Confer- !
I ence champions to that of only a l
j strong second-place team among ;
I three different departments of the
Cardinals' game.
Foremost of the weaknesses was i
the failure to hit free throws in the
last three conference games. Until :
the Cal game last Friday, the In- !
diu ere coasting along with a
free tluow average of 61 per cent, as
j high as any other team in the coun- j
J try. However, in the last three tilts, I
: they have hit a meager 13 for 36 of
! their charity tosses for an average i
j of only 36 per cent.
Another glaring defect was the
| failure to cash in on easy points on
follow-up shots. True, Dean's for- ,
j wards, Anderson, Williams, and La- â€¢
; faille, are not physically capable of
j getting a lot of tip-ins. And yet
j Dean feels that they and the rest of j
j the team have been neglecting to get j
I in position for a few of those bas- 1

. kets the easy way.
The third point the Card coach |
touched in reviewing the last three j
\ games was that of individual de- I
. tense. Here again it was a matter of j
| position that allowed rival forwards
I to slip away for easy buckets and j
, also caused the Indians to commit too
I many fouls trying to recover them- !
! selves.
The practice schedule this week j
i will be intensive drill in these three j
1 departments in preparation for the |
two-game visit this coming week- 1
' end by those Terrible # Trojans.
