BOULDER, Colo., Feb. 19 (UP).â€”
A formal petition signed by 35 mem

"Big Seven" champion football team
demanding the immediate discharge
of Coach Bernard F. (Bunny) Oakes,
was presented today to the univer
sity's Board of Regents.
Coach Oakes, who was given a
vote of "complete confidence" by the
board last October after his team
lost its first three games and then
went on to win the conference title,
is under a five-year contract.
