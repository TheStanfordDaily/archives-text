# Democracy Blackout?
## 
### 
\\"W"OU may be next!"
i. Those were the words that I found em
blazoned on my office door this morning on the
outside of a p.p. (propaganda pamphlet). After
talking yesterday about bombs under the Shack
and musing inwardly regarding thin men with
black coats and blacker beards, I was afraid my
time had come. But it turned out to be another
appeal to my sense of democracy and a prayer
for the rehabilitation of the Constitution's Bill
of Rights.
The general idea of this latest appeal is, like
mos of the other appeals, an effort to glean
funds to foster higher court efforts for William
Schneiderman, Sam Darcy, and Earl Browder,
ex-Communist leaders and perpetual candidates
for everything. Personally their pleas for as
sistance aren't worth the plugged dime one of
the brothers pawned off on me last week. The
only trouble about having them in jail is that
we as future tax-payers will bear the brunt of
feeding and clothing these expounders of a
faith completely alien to all decent American
traditions.
"Wall Street is driving toward war," they
yelp; yet it seems that the United States is a
good deal farther from actual battle than Rus
sia, beloved fatherland of the faith. And there
isn't any Wall Street—or a New Montgomery
either—in the environs of Leningrad or Moskva,
hangouts of Stalin the Terrible.
The expounders of the cause will tell you that
their leaders were encased behind bars on
"flimsy technical charges," but even if they
were, didn't they finally get A1 Capone on an
income tax evasion? It might be the sissy's
way to gain his desired ends, but they still don't
qet our plugged dime.
If, as they say, the Dies Committee, the De
partment of Justice, and the Associated Farmers
are whipping up war hysteria and trying to
round up our "alien agitators" and "foreign
agents," then we shall immediately ship the
slug to one of those agencies.
Provided of course that Congressman Dies
promises to leave Shirley Temple alone with
her dolls.
