TWO years ago, when Gerald Marcus and
Carl Deisenroth returned from an Eastern
debate tour, they handed the Farm a new po
litical plaything.
It was an idea they had picked up at Yale—
the notion of a Political Union, patterned after
the Oxford Union. It was to follow the plan of
a legislative body, complete with officers and
boasting three parties representing divergent
political views. This body would debate im
portant and timely national and international
issues, then vote its opinion. Stanford thought
it was a good idea.
Attacked from too many sources for its de
tached, away-from-the-world manner, Stanford
was glad to show critics that, given the oppor
tunity, it could argue intelligently about mat
ters of genuine importance. Party chiefs were
elected by the Laborites, Liberals, and Conser
vatives. Tryoutees were interviewed for mem
bership and a long waiting list resulted. The
idea went over with a bang-bang.
But this year, when political issues are hottest
and international argument runs rife, the S.P.U.
has been waning. Attempting to revive flag
ging interest last month, President Oliver Wy
man broke a charter rule, invited a political
science professor to address the group.
And last night the Stanford Political Union,
nearing its three-year mark, met in an obscure
corner of the School of Letters. The topic it
discussed—a third term for President Roosevelt.
Thirteen members were present, where once
nearly two hundred attended.
And this is not flattery for either Stanford 01
President Roosevelt.—D. H.
