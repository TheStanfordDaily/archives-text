# CAMPUS OPINION
## THE 						GOOD DIE YOUNG 
### 
'FHE EDITOR, SIR:
In answering the letter signed "Against Drugs,"
wc feel that it is our duty, being free, white, and so
forth Stanford "students." and we hereby submit the
general theme—mind your own business.
It is our unfailing opinion that we are free to do
what we please in our private lives so long as it is
becoming to a Stanford man. When we smoke on the
campus we follow the tradition of abstinence in the
proper places. That is the opinion of the students and
wc abide by that unwritten authority.

If we want lo smoke and give ourselves enlarged
heart and broken down lungs we're just independent
enough to do so and enjoy it all along. If some stu
dents don't want to smoke, let it be so; but why in
goodness gracious name can't they let us dope fiends
alone. We like it and if we're to die young let us do
it in peace.
