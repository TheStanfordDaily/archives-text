# UP IN SMOKE

r |MIE EDITOR, SIR:
Someone finally wised up and put two lovely
enormous ash receivers on the Libe steps for victims
of that demon nicotine. How nice, we all say, now
the steps won't look like the Cellar floor at 10:40 p.m.
Well, hell, it seems that there are always a few half
wit individuals who, either because of a lack of good
breeding, or out of a purely stinko insolent nature, go
on their merry way, crushing out snipes on the steps.
It isn't bad enough to have the ash receptacles ig
nored, but these rugged individuals drop their fags
within a foot or two of the darned things.
It looks like the devil—it really does—and I think
a mass necktie party for the tramps who have been
messing up things would be a wonderful project for
somebody with influence and suction to undertake.
Meanwhile, why don't you guys and gals about
whom I speak try to hit the bucket once in a while?
It takes a little energy, sure, but it's really worth it.
You aren't as rough as you think you are.
