### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
FATHER COUGHLIN AND DETECTIVE DIES
COUGHLIN has been accepted by the Dies
Committee as a volunteer witness. The man whose
Fascist voice enraged a democratic radio audience is
going to "expose un-American activities." Coughlin
and Dies are a good pair; neither one of them has
any inhibitions against slander or a modicum of love
for proof.
And Coughlin as a defender of democracy is good
for the best laugh of the week. But there the good
points of this latest insult to American intelligence
ends. When Coughlin starts to campaign against un-
American activities, it is time for Sally Hand to lecture
on modesty.
In fact, if the Detroit demagogue is an apostle of
Americanism, this country is really in for some thor
ough-going foreignizing. If Father Coughlin is a mod
ern prophet of the Spirit of '76 ,then our whole social
structure needs reorganizing. First of all, the League
of Nations will have to reconvene for the purpose of
electing Adolph Hitler president of the Council. And
the new president's first move should be to expel
Switzerland for fomenting war. (Neither Britain nor
Germany are sinking those neutral ships; it must be
the Swiss who are guilty.)
* * * Sjc
we will also have problems of re
adjustment. J. Edgar Hoover must go; turn the
rascal out. If Coughlin is defender of the Constitution,
then A1 Capone should be head of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.
Other appointments might include the following:
Mrs. Roosevelt for President of the Deaf-mutes So
ciety; the U.S.C. football team for Edward Atherton's
bodyguard; Billy Rose, of Aquacade fame, for Dean of
Women; W. C. Fields for chairman of the Prohibition
ist Party; and Shirley Temple to lead the old-age
pensioners.
Yes, the Dies Committee is going to have quite a
problem on its hands if it follows the Coughlin-democ
racy style. Its overeonfidence borders on comic-strip
pipe-dreaming. Martin Dies must have been reading
"Superman" or "Flash Gordon."
And the irreverent Father Coughlin must have been
studying "Mein Kampf" as a Civics text.
His indictments will commence in a few days. And
I understand they are going to substitute a single ques
tion for the sobriety test: "Do you believe Father
Coughljn's indictments of Americanism, or have you
been drinking straight Scotch with gin chasers?"

we will also have problems of re
adjustment. J. Edgar Hoover must go; turn the
rascal out. If Coughlin is defender of the Constitution,
then A1 Capone should be head of the Federal Bureau
of Investigation.
Other appointments might include the following:
Mrs. Roosevelt for President of the Deaf-mutes So
ciety; the U.S.C. football team for Edward Atherton's
bodyguard; Billy Rose, of Aquacade fame, for Dean of
Women; W. C. Fields for chairman of the Prohibition
ist Party; and Shirley Temple to lead the old-age
pensioners.
Yes, the Dies Committee is going to have quite a
problem on its hands if it follows the Coughlin-democ
racy style. Its overeonfidence borders on comic-strip
pipe-dreaming. Martin Dies must have been reading
"Superman" or "Flash Gordon."
And the irreverent Father Coughlin must have been
studying "Mein Kampf" as a Civics text.
His indictments will commence in a few days. And
I understand they are going to substitute a single ques
tion for the sobriety test: "Do you believe Father
Coughljn's indictments of Americanism, or have you
been drinking straight Scotch with gin chasers?"
FATHER COUGHLIN AND DETECTIVE DIES
COUGHLIN has been accepted by the Dies
Committee as a volunteer witness. The man whose
Fascist voice enraged a democratic radio audience is
going to "expose un-American activities." Coughlin
and Dies are a good pair; neither one of them has
any inhibitions against slander or a modicum of love
for proof.
And Coughlin as a defender of democracy is good
for the best laugh of the week. But there the good
points of this latest insult to American intelligence
ends. When Coughlin starts to campaign against un-
American activities, it is time for Sally Hand to lecture
on modesty.
In fact, if the Detroit demagogue is an apostle of
Americanism, this country is really in for some thor
ough-going foreignizing. If Father Coughlin is a mod
ern prophet of the Spirit of '76 ,then our whole social
structure needs reorganizing. First of all, the League
of Nations will have to reconvene for the purpose of
electing Adolph Hitler president of the Council. And
the new president's first move should be to expel
Switzerland for fomenting war. (Neither Britain nor
Germany are sinking those neutral ships; it must be
the Swiss who are guilty.)
