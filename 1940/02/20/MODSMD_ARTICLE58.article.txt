# WARM LIKE THE MONTH OF MAY

Yes, as they say, Spring is coming.
(Spring is a great thing; "it is a great thing to be
in the midst of, and a great thing to write about.)
But without checking on the canoes on the Lake or
looking around outside, I know spring is on the way.
I have seen one tell-tale bandage covering a barbed
wire gash on a female arm, and they tell me there is
at least one case of poison oak rolling around the Farm
today.
