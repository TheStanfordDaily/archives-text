# AND SPRING'S PLAGUE
## 
### 
But one of the boys on the campus was going to be
cagey this year. Early in the quarter he started taking
regular shots to insure antitoxin against poison oak
in preparation for spring.
It was about a week ago that they gave him an
overdose.
He is wishing now that he had just gone out in the
country and caught poison oak the way everyone else
gets it.
