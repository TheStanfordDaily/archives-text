# Poughkeepsie Race Tradition Backs Up Stanford's Crew
## 
### BY ROSEMARIE MULLANY 
If anyone's at all worried about a tradition for the new crew to fall
back on, let him now take heart.
In 1J)12 the Farm had a crew so good that it was decided to pack the
Card oar-dippers off to Poughkecpsic for the annual crew classic . . . .
one small, persistent obstacle, however, was the financial situation.

, It was estimated that the cost of
getting eight men, a coach and a
coxswain back to that New York
waterway would be approximately i
$2000. On April 24, 1912, the Daily
Palo Alto (four columns) went off
the two-column end and ran the
first of numerous stories campaign
ing for funds.
$1,300 COLLECTED
At the end of the Palo Alto's pub
lishing period, less than a month be
fore the crew would have to leave,
$1,300 had been collected, more was
coming from enthusiastic alumni,
and everything pointed to a Stanford
shell on the Hudson come June.
The entrance petition submitted
by the Cardinals was accepted by
regatta officials and the month-long
campaign with its discouragements
and doubtful moments was culmi
nated when the crew arrived at
Poughkecpsic on June 14 and started
a brief training period.
lIEAT WAS INTENSE
"The summer heat was intense," I
the 1914 Quad records, "and the var- j
sity could train only in the morn- j
ings. Previous to the race, the var- ;
sity covered the course in better j
time than the winning Cornell j
crew."
Which seems to be as good a way j
as any of saying that the Cardinal \
crewmen did not win the regatta, j
No, they crossed the finish line sixth j
with Cornell, Wisconsin, Columbia, j
Syracuse, and Pennsylvania pre- j
ceeding them in that order.
ENTHUSIASM HIGH
During those years from 1904 to
1913, however, crew as a sport at
Stanford had all the push and en
thusiasm behind it that is today as
sociated with varsity football, if the i
records are to be trusted.
The motto of that ambitious 1912 !
bunch, the tag-line under which |
they raised the $2000 seems not ill- !
fitting to dangle now at Stanford's |
1940 crew:
"On to Poughkecpsie."
