One of the bovs was down town recently to buy a
recording of "The Princess Poo-Pooly." There was one
record of it left at the record store, and two girls in
their early teens were listening to it behind closed
doors, jitter-bugging around.
The guy waited for them to come out. and asked
them if they were going to buy it.
"No, you can have it," they said. "The rhythm is
swell, but we don't see anything to those words at all."
