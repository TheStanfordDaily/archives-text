# Britisher Stalks Dictator In Emotion-Packed Novel
## 
### 
"ROGUE MALE," by Geoffrey Household.
You can read this book in an hour and a luilf. Rut I'm willing to
prophesy tliat you won't forget it until long after the present Europeon
scrimmage has graduated from 100-point banner lines to the pages of the
history texts. +

Packing the same emotional shock
as last spring's much discussed "Ad- i
dress Unknown," this book depends
on understatement of a fundamen- '
tally melodramatic plot for its im
pact.
It is the diary of an upper-class
Englishman — you never know his
name, but the quiet confidence with
which he assumes you will know it,
makes the thing even more fasci
nating—who tells of his attempt at
stalking the biggest game in the
world, man. In this case the man is
an unnamed dictator, but there's ab
solutely no question as to who he is. 1
PSYCHOLOGICAL STUDY
Underlying the story of his first 1
attempt, during which he is cap- j
tured. his escape, and his search for
sanctuary in England, is the com- \
plex problem of the man's mind. He
cannot admit that he tried the stalk
for anything but the sport of it —to
see whether it could be done—and
he swears that he had no intention
of pulling the trigger.
Smash climax comes when, in the
unspeakable filth and damp of a i
tiny cave where he is being held I
prisoner by two Nazi agents, he
suddenly comes to the realization
that, more than anything else in the
world, he wanted to kill that dicta
tor; and that he still does.
MAN'S BOOK
The predicament of a man who |
takes unto himself a job of such
international scope without any
backing at all, has rather horrible
ramifications. No man, operating
lone-wolf style can, if he is a gen
tleman, ask the protection of his
government or his friends.
Thus, though he is in England, he
is only one jump ahead of the Nazi
agents, and when they finally cap
ture him, he can look for no help I
outside himself.
"Rogue Male" is a man's book, for j
it is the stox - y of a man living under
jungle law—kill or be killed. In the
end, he escapes to try his luck
again, and this time you know he
will not fail. All the mixed emo
tions of his early mood are gone, and I
he has congpaled into a man with |
one aim. Kill that Dictator. The i
reader understands.—Nowell
