## Salamander Poison Kills Cougar in Zoo 
### 
Internally, the Stanford rough is
coming back.
No doubt Craig Williamson and
Robert Connell, Stanford's own sala
mander eaters, are getting tired of
the gory publicity they have been
receiving as a result of their am
phibian-eating escapade last year,
but the little creatures have of late
taken up poisoning animals at the
Alameda County Zoological Gar
dens in Oakland, and the obvious
comparison has proved too much
for Coast newsmen.
Under headings such as "Stan
ford Men Tougher than Cougars,"
the press gleefully pointed out yes
terday the fact that a cougar cub
died Sunday as a result of eating
amphibians of the same species as
those devoured by Williamson and
Connell.
According to Sidney Snow, direc
tor of the zoo, the salamanders in
habit a creek which runs through
the grounds, from which they crawl
up to the cages where they are de
voured by the animals. Several
cases of sickness have been noted
before, but Sunday's incident was
the first case in which an animal
has died of the poison secreted in
the creatures.
According to Stanford biologists,
who made the original discovery of
the poison, Williamson and Connell
were unaffected by their meal for
one of two reasons: either the sala
manders were males, which are not
poisonous; or, if they were females,
they must have resorbed their eggs
before they were eaten.
