### WILSON CANNON 
jIAMMER and Sickle stock soared
to a new high on the interna
tional market last night.
Russia's war machine found tife
missing cog in its gears and shifted
into high speed on the southern tan
gent of the Mannerheim Line near
the vital Finnish seaport of Viipuri.
Checked by the desperately fighting
defenders lor three weeks, the
Soviet army climaxed a consecutive
21-day drive on the 60-mile battle
front by achieving its most im
portant victory of the war.
While Finnish foreign releases at
first strongly denied — then signifi
cantly refused to discuss — Russian
claims to an overwhelming victory
in that area, Danish and Swedish
sources revealed that the new Finn
ish defense line runs five miles
southeast of Viipuri . . . with that
city itself included in the new Man
nerheim defense system.

Reports issuing from Moscow
based their paen of victory on the
capture of the key fortress of
Koivisto, situated on Bjorkoe
Island and guardian of the sea ap
proach to Viipuri. (Authoritative
sources in Helsinki admitted the
loss of this fortress but denied
Russian claims of further victory
nearer the threatened seaport.)
The fortress formerly anchored
the Mannerheim Line to the Gulf
of Finland but since the with
drawal of the Finnish forces it
was believed that a new anchor
has been drawn to the south.
If the Russian claim to the capture
of Koivisto is true, it means that
Viipuri is doomed within the next
few weeks . . . and if Viipuri falls
the Finnish defense would be dealt
an almost fatal blow—a blow which
would leave Finland little chance to
defend the remainder of its south
ern coast.
»»« At
r J' , HE biggest factor in the Finnish
defense thus far has been the
strategic nature of its defense line.
A twisting, turning, baffling line of
hills, lakes and rivers has allowed
the swiftly moving Finns to strike
paralyzing blows at the Russians
without fear of mass reprisal at
tacks.
But Mother Nature, who has so
long given its best to the little
Scandinavian country, has finally
decided to pull a long-delayed ace
from her sleeve marked "Joe Stal
in, with regards."*-
Once the Soviet forces gain
Viipuri they can pull the full-speed
ahead handle. Ahead of them will
lie . . . not a natural wall of lakes
and rivers, but a softly rolling plain
with no major strategic point from
which the defenders can base their
greased-lightning raids. Foreign
observers believe that from Viipuri
the Russians will merely have to go
through the gestures, the real fight
will be over. Moscow can slip the
leashes on its war dogs, send them
on a flanking movement around the
southern end of the Mannerheim
Line, and attack the Finnish de
fenses from the rear.

yiIPURI, which the best brains in
the Finn board of military
strategy claimed would never fall,
seems ready to give up soon. If the
Russians have Koivisto they have
the key, for while Viipuri could
possibly handle attack from inland,
its island-laden harbor is completely
lacking in fortifications.
And the final slap to the wrist
of Finnish resistance is a solid,
glimmering sheet of ice now cov
ered with a layer of hard-packed
snow. For the harbor of Viipuri
is frozen solid . . . thick enough
to allow mechanized Soviet forces
to surge forward in a direct with
ering attack under which the Finn
ish seaport must fall . . . unless
foreign aid comes mighty soon.
Ironically enough, the question of
foreign aid hinges on a Scandinavian
brother; for Sweden, now in prac
tical revolt over the question, must
change its stand on the matter of
foreign relief troops crossing her
borders en route to Finland before
help will come. The good big man
is coming close to winning the de
cision.
