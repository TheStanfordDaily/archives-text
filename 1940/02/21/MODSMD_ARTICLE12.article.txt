# Gallery Features Gold Rush Photos

Photographs of the gold country
where Bret Harte wrote "Outcasts
of Poker Flat" and Black Bail held
up stages in the High Sierras are on
display in the art gallery until the
end of the month. They were taken
over a period of 15 years by Louis J.
Stellman for his book, "Mother
Lode."
An experienced cameraman who
has sold many of his pictures to
California newspapers, Mr. Stellman
is noted for his ability to get the
atmosphere of the once booming
ghost towns into his photographs.
Scenes of Bret Harte's town of
Slumgullion, of Robinson's ferry,
which made $10,000 in one week, of
the iron-shuttered doors and win
dows to guard against fire and
bandits, a bridge across the Yuba,
where a mob hanged a woman in
the early 'fifties, and other scenes
all tell dramatically the history of
the Gold Era.
