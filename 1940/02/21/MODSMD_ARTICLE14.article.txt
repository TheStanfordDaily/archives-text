# Luck Attends Play Director
## 'George, Margaret' Cast Adopts Mascot 
### MARY JUDSON 
Does Stanford believe in four
leaf clovers? Do Farm students be
lieve in horseshoes, or that the third
chance is a charm?
If Stanford does, then campus au
diences are due for a lucky break
with "George and Margaret," ac
cording to F. C. Strickland, who is
directing the play.
Recalling two former outstanding
runs of "George and Margaret,"
Director Strickland reported a
packed house for a Washington per
formance which, following a series
of other benefit plays, was given
for the benefit of the players them
selves. In Boothe, Maine, audiences
braved a 10-day fog to see Gerald
Savery's London hit when other
plays didn't draw.
ANOTHER "MEN
Following "The Warrior's Hus
band" hit, Director Strickland feels
that once again "George and Mar
garet" will stand him in good stead
remembering that three's a charm,
and that another good luck omen has
turned up.
Just before the opening perform
ance of "Richard II" in St. Louis,
Mr. Strickland found a homeless dog
on the steps of the theater. He
brought, tlie pup in and kept him.
The show was successful and there
after the dog was a much-petted
mascot.
'EXCURSION' LUCK
The luck continued. On the way
to the opening night of "Excursion,"
given in Washington, Mr. Strick
land found a lost pup wandering in
the streets. Once again he took care
of the dog. An excellent run of "Ex
cursion" followed, once more pro
viding the lucky director with a
mascot.
It seems inevitable that the charm
should turn up a third time. The
night that "The Warrior's Husband"
opened on the campus, a third home
less dog wandered in for Director
Strickland's protection. Christened
"Hercules" in honor of the play, the
"perp," according to Mr. Strickland,
has a permanent home insured in
return for the luck he carries for
Stanford players.
