ulty representative on the Conference, told the Interfraternitv Council

>at a dinner meeting at the Fiji

tertainment or rushing of boys of
known athletic ability, before they
, have enrolled, through fraternities,
service clubs, or other organiza
j tions.
2. There will he no restrictions
on jobs, hashing or otherwise,
granted to athletes in fraternities
1 so long as they are bona-fide jobs.
