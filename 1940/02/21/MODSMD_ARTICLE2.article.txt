# Finns Claim Nazi Threat To Sweden
## King Gustav Battles For Scandinavian Neutrality in War 
### 
COPENHAGEN, Denmark, Feb.
20 (UP). â€” Leading Scandinavian
newspapers charged today Ger
many had threatened to involve
Sweden in the European war if
Sweden actively participated in
the military defense of Finland.
They said that from the declara
tions of the Swedish Premier and
the Swedish King it was clear some
country or countries had threatened
Sweden with war. Leading Swedish
and Finnish newspapers claimed
Germany was that country.
The semi-official Finnish news
paper Helsingin Sanomat, in Hel
sinki, accuscd Sweden of hurting the
"vital interests of Sweden" by giv
ing way before the "real or imagi
nary threat" of involvement in a
general war.
THREATENS WAR
Commenting on King Gustaf's
proclamation yesterday that Sweden
could not intervene on behalf of
Finland without herself being drawn
into a general war, the newspaper
openly accused Germany with
threatening war in order to halt
Sweden's desire to aid the Finns
militarily.
"Germany, who 20 years ago
helped us against Communism, now
follows a policy which surrenders
us to Russia," the paper said.
INSISTS ON AID
Foreign reports that the Swedish
army intends to force the govern
ment's hand over the King's head by
insisting on military aid for Fin
land were denied categorically by
Swedish authorities.
On the contrary, hundreds of tele
grams from all over Sweden poured
into the King's palace today con
gratulating him for his clear ex
planation of Sweden's position.
Many of them came from former op
ponents of the government's policy.
MAY FORCE ABDICATION
(The Stockholm correspondent of
the Oslo Tidens Tegn, commenting
on Sweden's position regarding Fin
land, had suggested that the Swe
dish "activists" or those favoring
military intervention to aid the
Finns, might force a solution of Swe
den's problem by a coup d'etat in
which King Gustaf would be forced
to abdicate in .favor of the Crown
Prince, who would form a new cab
inet.)
All opposition to Sweden's com
plete neutrality, it was felt in Stock
holm, has been completely quashed
by the King's realistic explanation
that Swedish aid to Finland would
be decreased by any intervention
which would involve Sweden in a
major war.
