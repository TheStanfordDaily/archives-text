# Indian Stamp Fans Wanted
## 
### 
Radio station KSFO is on a talent
hunt on the Stanford campus—only
in this case it's specialized talent
required.
Eight philatelists from the Farm
are wanted to appear on March 31
from 4:30 to 5 o'clock to take part
in a spell-down program conducted
by Sydney Goldic, stamp editor of
the San Francisco Examiner.
Questions will be simple, the Daily
was assured, and at the conclusion
of the program the winner will re
ceive a prize, rumored to be an ex
clusive album.
KSFO would also like to have a
faculty member interested in stamps
as a guest on the program, accord
ing to information received.
It's a case of first come first
served—the first eight students who
turn in their applications to The
Daily will be the ones on the pro
gram.
