# Frosh Five Faces Modesto Friday
## 
### 
When the Card frosh cagers take
the court next Friday evening in the
preliminary to the Stanford-U.S.C.
tilt, they will face what is probably
the best team that they have met all
seasonâ€”Modesto Junior College.
Marin was rated high in the? jun
ior college hoop loop too until the
Frosh knocked them over, but it
took the very best brand of ball on
the part of Beeb Lee's charges to
turn the trick. However, whether
they can turn back the Papoose
cagers or not, Modesto J. C.is prob
ably still strong enough to cop their
conference crown.
Modesto holds a victory, with a
six-point, margin, over the Cal Cubs,
a team that Stanford just did beat
by one point; all of which goes to
show that Modesto will be no mean
opponent.
