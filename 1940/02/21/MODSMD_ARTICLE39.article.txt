NIGHT BASEBALL . . .
Will be introduced to the Farm
nine next week. Nope, the B.A.C.
isn't contemplating the installation
of lights out on the Sunken Dia
mond— although that might be a
good bet in predicting the future
of Stanford's athletic plant.
St. Mary's will use the lighted
Seals Stadium, home of the San
Francisco P.C.L. club, as their own
grounds this season for both
night and afternoon ball games.
Coach Harry Woltcr's nine helps
the Gaels inaugurate after-dinner
tilts next Wednesday, Feb. 28, and
then March (i, the Injuns play
under the huge ma/das with Earl
Sheely's Moragans.
All told the Gaels will play about
seven tiffs at night. Perhaps we'll
see college nines playing all their
games after dark, just as minor loop
teams and Softball clubs do.

NO INDIANS . .
Are going to hit the diamond dust
this year, without giving a real fight,
quoth Coach Wolter. He's not claim
ing the intercollegiate baseball title
lor his club, but the team isn't go
ing to be kicked around by anyone.
Wolter thought the Indians
looked much better than at any
other time this season against
Kenealy's Seals, a San Francisco
semi-pro team, Monday. Stan
ford's defense in the infield is go
ing to be one of the team's great
est fortes, although no one's over
looking the fact that "Cootie"
Thompson, No. 1 Hurler, is one of
the best college chuckers in the
business. The Seals got hold of
several of "Cootie's" pitches but a
tight defense held them to three
hits in 11 inning^.
IT'S TOUGH . . .
That rugby, the only sport here
that doesn't ask for any awards for
its players, has to be tied down to
the apron strings of the P.C.C. Those
are Coach Harry Maloney's senti
ments, and after talking with him
for half an hour or so, those are mine
also.
Because rugby is under the
guardian care of the conference,
the usual rules for eligibility are
invoked, tl shouldnt' he, Ma
loney argues.
Since ruggers get no tangible re
ward for participating, Maloney and
Slants can't see why anyone who
wants to can't be eligible for the
sport, barring ,of course, those who
are in scholastic difficulties. Ma
loney knows of a number of grad
uates and transfers on the Farm
who'd get a bang out of playing if
the present barriers were lowered.

Because rugby is under the
guardian care of the conference,
the usual rules for eligibility are
invoked, tl shouldnt' he, Ma
loney argues.
Since ruggers get no tangible re
ward for participating, Maloney and
Slants can't see why anyone who
wants to can't be eligible for the
sport, barring ,of course, those who
are in scholastic difficulties. Ma
loney knows of a number of grad
uates and transfers on the Farm
who'd get a bang out of playing if
the present barriers were lowered.
NIGHT BASEBALL . . .
Will be introduced to the Farm
nine next week. Nope, the B.A.C.
isn't contemplating the installation
of lights out on the Sunken Dia
mond— although that might be a
good bet in predicting the future
of Stanford's athletic plant.
St. Mary's will use the lighted
Seals Stadium, home of the San
Francisco P.C.L. club, as their own
grounds this season for both
night and afternoon ball games.
Coach Harry Woltcr's nine helps
the Gaels inaugurate after-dinner
tilts next Wednesday, Feb. 28, and
then March (i, the Injuns play
under the huge ma/das with Earl
Sheely's Moragans.
All told the Gaels will play about
seven tiffs at night. Perhaps we'll
see college nines playing all their
games after dark, just as minor loop
teams and Softball clubs do.

NO INDIANS . .
Are going to hit the diamond dust
this year, without giving a real fight,
quoth Coach Wolter. He's not claim
ing the intercollegiate baseball title
lor his club, but the team isn't go
ing to be kicked around by anyone.
Wolter thought the Indians
looked much better than at any
other time this season against
Kenealy's Seals, a San Francisco
semi-pro team, Monday. Stan
ford's defense in the infield is go
ing to be one of the team's great
est fortes, although no one's over
looking the fact that "Cootie"
Thompson, No. 1 Hurler, is one of
the best college chuckers in the
business. The Seals got hold of
several of "Cootie's" pitches but a
tight defense held them to three
hits in 11 inning^.
IT'S TOUGH . . .
That rugby, the only sport here
that doesn't ask for any awards for
its players, has to be tied down to
the apron strings of the P.C.C. Those
are Coach Harry Maloney's senti
ments, and after talking with him
for half an hour or so, those are mine
also.
