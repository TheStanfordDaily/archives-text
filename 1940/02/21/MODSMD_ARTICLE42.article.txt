# Cagers Prepare for Trojans
## 
### 
Concentrating on individual de-
I lense today in a light scrimmage,
I Stanford's basketballers will bring
j to a close their week of practice in
j preparation for their two games with
U.S.C.'s conference-leading cagers
here this week-end.
Coach Everett Dean is keeping
j practice at a minimum this week
in order to insure the Indians' being
in lop shape for (ho two grueling
| games in store tor them. Rebound
| ing and scrapping against such big
| men as- Sears, McGarvin, and Mor
! rison, and having to contend with a
! long string of capable Trojan subs
I told heavily on the Card cagers in
) their first encounter with Troy,
j However, with everybody in the
| best of condition and sure ol being
â€¢ well rested by Friday night, Stan
| ford's hoopsters should bounce back
I and play the game they are capable
! of -
The squad held competitive free
j throwing in practice yesterday in
order to bolster their falling free
throw average. Dean also had his

charges hounding that backboard in
a semiscrimmage as the first and
second strings ran their offense
against the reserves.
