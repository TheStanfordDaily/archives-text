ens Club of Oakland iust long !
enough to be charged with the de- j
feat, in a game played earlier in the !
season.

it two in a row off the Erie club. !

FRANK PFYLIN
Frank Pl'yl, big brother of the
Cards' veteran shortstop, is a sur
prise nominee for the regular right
field job held down so far by Jnck
Parsons and Jim Verdieck. Piyl
started against the Kenealy Seals
Monday and connected ior one ol
hir. team's six hits.
The other two outfield posts are
being held down by Norm Juney and
Alex Cereghino. Juney regained his
j batting eye Monday, cracking out
j two singles in three trips to the
I plate. Elton Boone also showed
I signs of snapping a batting slump,
j getting one bingle and hitting the
j ball hard several times.
USE SEVERAL HURLERS
1 Harry Wolter plans to use as many
j pitchers as he can tomorrow in an
effort to get a final line on his hurl
ing staff. Cootie Thompson is a
cinch to start a lot of ball games,
but another starting chucker will
have to be developed from Claude
Purkitt, Russ Smith, Bill Masters,
] and Dyck.
The infield tomorrow will be
I composed of Hal Costello at first,
| either Harry Parsons or Dick
j Shortall at second, Boone at third,
! and Monty Pfyl at short.
