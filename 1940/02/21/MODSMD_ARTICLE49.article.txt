# Fighters Meet Bears Tonight
## 
### 
With the respective captains
clashing in a welterweight "grudge"
battle, the boxing teams of Stanford
and California tangle tonight in the
Bear's gym in their sixth meeting.
Stanford's Jack Rice, recently
elected captain, has fought Capt.
Juel Droubay of Gil five times in
the 145-lb. division and has won
three of the bouts. The two rivals
will be out to bash each other with
all the friendly hatred of a long
series of fights.
Indian Don Grant tackles George
Wharton in the heavyweight wind
up, with plenty of fireworks expected
to satisfy those boisterous Cal fans.

120 lb.—Ted Doe (S) vs. Handa (C)
127 lb.—Bruce Berg (S) vs. Foster
