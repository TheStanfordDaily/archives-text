TNTERFRATERNITY COUNCIL mulled over
1 some of the more technical provisions of the
mythical "Atherlon Code" last night and there
by clarified some tenets which should prove
a boon to Stanford.
The general idea of the whole new arrange
ment is to prevent athletes from "riding"
through college without working for their board
and keep. Neither Atherton nor the Pacific
Coast Conference desires to keep any deserving
physical specimen out of the school of his own
choosing. And Interfraternity Council, in ex
plaining the true meaning of the rulings, has
set an example that all the eating clubs and
living groups can well follow.
Any athlete may earn the eguivalent of room
and board from any available source—frater
nity, eating club, or lodging house —so long as
he can show that he is working for his wages.
The prevailing wage scale, now fifty cents an
hour, has been set as an arbitrary figure. That
means that the athletes still can hash, cut lawns,
make beds, or any of the other odd-hour tasks,
and receive as much as fifty dollars a month (or
room and board) for their labors.
No one is harmed except those who never
wanted anything more than a joy-ride through
the fun half of college, and it's almost a cer
tainty that the ambitious high school athletes
would never have resorted to loafing tactics in
the first place if over-energetic rush committees
and enthusiastic alumni hadn't given them the
wrong cue.
Even this year, in the various club and house
groups, there are probably well over 25 per
cent of the pledges who have been promised
everything from the basement to the roof on the
house if they only pledged dear old Tappa Keg.
Of course, Atherton and the Conference will
suffer a lot of attack from every imaginable
angle, still the chances are mighty bright for the
athletes of the future to graduate with a good
deal more ambition and willingness to learn
than some of the boys who have gone before.

wanted anything more than a joy-ride through
the fun half of college, and it's almost a cer
tainty that the ambitious high school athletes
would never have resorted to loafing tactics in
the first place if over-energetic rush committees
and enthusiastic alumni hadn't given them the
wrong cue.
Even this year, in the various club and house
groups, there are probably well over 25 per
cent of the pledges who have been promised
everything from the basement to the roof on the
house if they only pledged dear old Tappa Keg.
Of course, Atherton and the Conference will
suffer a lot of attack from every imaginable
angle, still the chances are mighty bright for the
athletes of the future to graduate with a good
deal more ambition and willingness to learn
than some of the boys who have gone before.
