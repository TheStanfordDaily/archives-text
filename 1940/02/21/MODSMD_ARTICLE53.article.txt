to the Farm" once again promises to
JD become a battle cry on the campus.
"Back to the Farm"—a three-day period of fun,
March 7, 8, and 9; a time when one may once
again say "hello" to a passer-by without re
ceiving a look of utter astonishment, a time
when cars will be put away except for the
most needy of causes, a time when one will
wear either cords or jeans or gingham dresses.
It should be fun in the old-time way—a bar
becue, a boathouse day, a barn dance, and most
important of all it will be a fitting manner in
which to introduce Clark Shaughnessy to the
Farm and to Farm spirit.
Years ago "Back to the Farm" days were held
annually but, as was the case of the "mud fight"
and many other Stanford traditions, it too be
came a farce far out of all bounds of propriety,
and like the others passed on out of the picture.
But don't let this revival of one of the old
traditions go to the extreme as in the past. Stan
ford needn't sacrifice good taste for a week-end
of fun.—G. H.
