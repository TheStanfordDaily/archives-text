'THE EDITOR. SIR:
Perhaps the fact that a man is a football player
nd a Physical Education major qualifies him to ref
<ne an intramural basketball game. I think not.
Somewhere in this university there must be a few men

who know more about basketball than what is to be
learned through reading textbooks.
Let's see the intramural manager either locate them
or issue brass knuckles to the players and let them
have a real battle. Our current officials seem to feel
that anything short of attempted manslaughter is
cause for a "jump ball."
After all, basketball is, supposedly, a game of speed
and skill, not brute force.
