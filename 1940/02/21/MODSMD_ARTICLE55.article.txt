If R. MELLINKOFF, CUR:
We feel that the lack of humanity on your pail
has been unreasonable. What happens? We lose a
beautiful little two-months-old Irish setter, advertise
in your paper, ask your aid; but you are above it all.
You must write about the National Labor Relations
Board which is more lost than our little puppy.
If the dignity of your column is above rendering
assistance to a heartbroken lover of canines, it's in no
small sense going to the dogs.
These are the facts—we lost an Irish setter puppy
at 2 o'clock Tuesday afternoon before the Memorial
Theater. Yes, a red puppy.
We beg your assistance, as we know you cannot be
so unkind ,as you have loved the dog as we have—it
has licked your hands.
Do not fail us. Our phone is 5063.
Your Doggone Friends,
The Gentlemen from Sin Valley
