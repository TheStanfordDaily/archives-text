### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
THE TIIIRI) TERM AND RED HERRINGS
Stanford Political Union turned thumbs down
on a Roosevelt third term yesterday. Most of the
Stanford campus would probably do the same. And
some of Roosevelt's opponents have coherent argu
ments against re-election of the most popular man in
the United States. They point to the tremendous naval
appropriations and the recent neglect by the New Deal
of the country's domestic problems—unemployment,
industrial slack, and both migrant and immobile slums.
But one of the most disappointing arguments
against Roosevelt's re-election is that old bogey, that
verbal red herring: "A third term is dangerous—dic
tatorial." The only advantage of this political super
stition is that it serves as subject matter for otherwise
vacuous speeches by candidates like Senator Taft
of Ohio.
At. first glance the third term taboo argument
sounds like some of the things we used to say at gram
mar school elections. "I'm not going to vote for Jim
my," we would say, "because he's already treasurer of
the monitors club."
ift * $ >k
B UT John D. M. Hamilton shakes a well-paid finger
at us and says that this third term danger is
really a Fascistic menace. Before we shiver and shake
and say "Kiel" to Fuehrer Franklin, it might be a good
idea to ask ourselves what the important causes of
dictatorship are, and whether a third term president is
one of them.
The answer to that question is written in the mod
ern history of Germany, Italy, and Russia. Those three
dictatorships grew out of widely divergent political
systems—out of Russian monarchy, German democ
racy, and Italy's limited monarchy. But the economic
conditions were strikingly similar. Poverty was a
common feature.
And in the United States today our great safe
guard against dictatorship must be the solving of our
economic problems. To meet these problems we need
intelligent, progressive leadership. These qualities are
the important personal issues in the Presidential elec
tion—not the sterile words, "third term."
But some presidential possibilities have already be
gun to evade the nation's vital problems, for which
they offer no constructive program, and satisfy them
selves by talking at great length about the menace of
a third term. They seem To feel that such lip-service
to democracy frees them from the fetters of our prac
tical problems, and in a sort of euphoric surge of self
confidence they imagine that they are striking at the
heart of the political crisis. In some parts of the
country it is a kind of sickness—the Republican nar
cosis.

THE TIIIRI) TERM AND RED HERRINGS
Stanford Political Union turned thumbs down
on a Roosevelt third term yesterday. Most of the
Stanford campus would probably do the same. And
some of Roosevelt's opponents have coherent argu
ments against re-election of the most popular man in
the United States. They point to the tremendous naval
appropriations and the recent neglect by the New Deal
of the country's domestic problems—unemployment,
industrial slack, and both migrant and immobile slums.
But one of the most disappointing arguments
against Roosevelt's re-election is that old bogey, that
verbal red herring: "A third term is dangerous—dic
tatorial." The only advantage of this political super
stition is that it serves as subject matter for otherwise
vacuous speeches by candidates like Senator Taft
of Ohio.
At. first glance the third term taboo argument
sounds like some of the things we used to say at gram
mar school elections. "I'm not going to vote for Jim
my," we would say, "because he's already treasurer of
the monitors club."

B UT John D. M. Hamilton shakes a well-paid finger
at us and says that this third term danger is
really a Fascistic menace. Before we shiver and shake
and say "Kiel" to Fuehrer Franklin, it might be a good
idea to ask ourselves what the important causes of
dictatorship are, and whether a third term president is
one of them.
The answer to that question is written in the mod
ern history of Germany, Italy, and Russia. Those three
dictatorships grew out of widely divergent political
systems—out of Russian monarchy, German democ
racy, and Italy's limited monarchy. But the economic
conditions were strikingly similar. Poverty was a
common feature.
And in the United States today our great safe
guard against dictatorship must be the solving of our
economic problems. To meet these problems we need
intelligent, progressive leadership. These qualities are
the important personal issues in the Presidential elec
tion—not the sterile words, "third term."
But some presidential possibilities have already be
gun to evade the nation's vital problems, for which
they offer no constructive program, and satisfy them
selves by talking at great length about the menace of
a third term. They seem To feel that such lip-service
to democracy frees them from the fetters of our prac
tical problems, and in a sort of euphoric surge of self
confidence they imagine that they are striking at the
heart of the political crisis. In some parts of the
country it is a kind of sickness—the Republican nar
cosis.
