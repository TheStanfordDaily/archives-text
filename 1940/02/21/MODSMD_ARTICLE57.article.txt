## W. FIRST-PERSON-SINGULAR S. 
### DOUG JAQUES 
William Saroyan, the American short story author
writing in San Francisco who comes from Fresno and
whose ancestry traces to Armenia, has written some
of the best stories of our day, and many of the worst.
It is rumored in Heaven that since Saroyan began
writing stories in the first person singular, Gabriel
has become increasingly more interested in pension
plans.
A few years ago fame caught up with this intelli
gent young Armenian who wears his heart on his
sleeve and, probably, gravy on his vest. San Fran
cisco columnists call him Bill, and New York gossip
writers refer to him in an awed sort of way as a young
man with a brain.
J. V. Cunningham, of the Stanford English depart
ment, knew him well a few years ago before fame
and the critics had taken him up.
Cunningham stepped on a San Francisco street cat
one day during this period at a crowded traffic hour.
Saroyan was at the other end of the car, and over the
startled heads of the crowd he yelled at Cunningham
in typical Saroyan fashion:
"Hey, Jim! How goes it? There's a guy out in
Brooklyn who thinks I'm a genius!"
