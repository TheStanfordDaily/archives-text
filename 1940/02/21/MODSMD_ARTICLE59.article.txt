Saroyan's cousin is a freshman here at Stanford
now and works on The Daily.
The first day he was around here he went up to a
group of the shots who were giving the tryoutces a
few rough lessons, and someone said he was William
Saroyan's cousin.
"Oh, really?" they said. "William Saroyan's cousin,
eh? Ah, yes." and went into a close huddle to find
out who William Saroyan was.
One of the freshman females standing on the outer
edge of this huddle supplied the answer. "Oh. he's
the famous German novelist." she said.
The only similarity I have noticed between Sa
royan's cousin and Saroyan as I find him in his
stories occurred the other day when young Saroyan
was explaining how he happened to flunk the English
A exam (all of us who are any good do).
Sounding exactly like his cousin, ho said, "I got so
interested in that short story that I forgot all about
the rules."
