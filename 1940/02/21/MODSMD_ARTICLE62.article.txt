# City, San Jose Programs Fill Concert Series Gap
## 
### 
Stanford music lovers who find '
the wait between A.S.S.U. con- j
certs too long, and who have the ;
wherewithal to get to either San ,
Jose or San Francisco, need not suf- I
fer for the next three weeks, for two I
excellent concerts and the San Carlo
Opera Company are nobly filling in ;
this interim. '
Most important, of course, is the
Marian Anderson concert scheduled
for a week from tomorrow night at
8:30 o'clock in San Jose's Civic Au
ditorium. Unquestionably the great- j
est contralto on the concert stage,
this famed singer can be depended |
on to give a thrilling performance j
any time.
SLENCZYNSKI RETURNS
Most of us remember the chubby
little piano prodigy, Ruth Slenc
zynski. She's fifteen now and will
give her first piano recital on the |
Coast in two years, on Thursday.!
March 7. She appears under the :
auspices of the Commission for Po- I
lish Relief.
The San Carlo Opera Company, on !
its annual tour, opened Monday |
night in the city and will be there j
through March 3.
The group sticks pretty close to
the traditional Italian repertoire,
and, of course, they are proudest of
their little Japanese soprano Hizi
Koyke, who is the most authentic
Madame Butterfly of all time. "But
terfly" will play a one-night stand
at the San Jose Civic Auditorium on
Monday, March 4.
