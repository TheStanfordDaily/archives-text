â€¢ CONFIDENCE
I The confidence of your physician
in' the purity of the prescription
chemicals and drugs we dispense
is fully justified. Scores of labora
tory tests are necessary before
these chemicals are released for
use by those who make them.
There are tests for the quality of
the raw materials; then a series of
tests throughout the process of
conversion; finally the exacting
tests of the finished product before
it is packaged for distribution.
Little wonder then that your phy
sician prescribes and we dispense
with full confidence in the purity
and reliability of the ingredients
which go into your prescription.
