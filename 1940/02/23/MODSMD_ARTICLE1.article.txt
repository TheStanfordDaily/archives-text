### WILSON CANNON 
pOUR snow-dusted soldiers hud
dled behind the scant shelter of
an uprooted fir tree. Knifing
through the branches and whistling
above their heads, a raging blizzard
pushed great blobs of snow through
the air, sent freezing breaths through
their thick winter clothing. Their
bodies were pushed closely together
for warmth, and one wearily lifted
a mittened hand to push the snow
from four rifles which were almost
covered by a rapidly-forming drift.
Four Finnish soldier's ... an out
post somewhere near Viipuri.
The scene abouJ them reflected
tiic same cold dreariness. In the
foreground, scant feet from the
four men, a silent figure leaned
against the side of what had been
an armed tank, hut lie did not
move. He was dead.
At his feet were two silent figures,
both seemingly molded from the
same icy pattern. Their eyes were
open and their arms were in a
strange position ... as if they
were try ing to ward of! some unseen
force. Behind them lay more fig
ures, and more, and more, until it,
seemed as though the snow was a |
great barren graveyard and all the
world was dead. Through the si
lence roared the great blast of the
blizzard, its voice the only sound on
the desolate scene.
For nearly 15 minutes there was
no movement within the small
group behind the fir tree. They
seemed a part of that great group
that would never move again. Then
one stirred and stiffly raised himself
to peer over the sheltering branches
Another spoke:
Ht s|c *
is it? Do you hear
them?'
"It is still quiet. But they will
come again. They always do." The
speaker's voice is thickly guttural,
almost unintelligible as it issues
from the heavy Halaklava helmet
which covers his head and face ex
cept for narrow inch-wide slits over
his eyes.
"Heinar, he is all right? Poor boy,
he is so young. He told them he
was 22, but he will not shave for
three years more."
"I think Heinar will never need a
razor. He has 100 many bullets in
him now. What do they think, we
Finns are not supermen."
The man slumped back to his
sitting position, his hroad hack
again covering the blunt nose of
die machine gun hidden beneath
I lie tree.
"How many Russians did we
kill tonight?"
"Maybe 500. They cannot fight.
When we shoot they stop and try
to hide in the snow. But there are
so many of them and no more of
us."
The sullen roar of motors was
heard through the blast of the storm
and the men peered upward toward
the airplanes. Nothing could be
seen.
* * *
<•4 do they go. Why can
they not stop bombing Vii
puri? They have been there seven
eight. times tonight. Maybe my wife
and son are still there. Why can
we do nothing?"
"It makes no difference. Viipuri
will fall. And when it docs the
Russians can sweep through Fin
land."
The first man turned and patted
(lie muzzle of (he gun behind
him.
"They do not while I have this.
Besides, I hear that England will
help us."
"What do you know? You have
been on the front six weeks. The
English cannot come. Sweden will
not let them through and King
Gustav is afraid."
The men lapsed again into silence,
too tired even to think. When would
help come?
Then one cursed.
"Quick, they come again."
Three pulled themselves to their
feet. The fourth sat still. The first
man leaned down and shook his
shoulder rorghly . . . and a great
red stain blotted the front of the
sitting man's uniform.

same icy pattern. Their eyes were
open and their arms were in a
strange position ... as if they
were try ing to ward of! some unseen
force. Behind them lay more fig
ures, and more, and more, until it,
seemed as though the snow was a |
great barren graveyard and all the
world was dead. Through the si

blizzard, its voice the only sound on
the desolate scene.
For nearly 15 minutes there was
no movement within the small
group behind the fir tree. They
seemed a part of that great group
that would never move again. Then
one stirred and stiffly raised himself
to peer over the sheltering branches
Another spoke:
Ht s|c *
is it? Do you hear
them?'
"It is still quiet. But they will
come again. They always do." The
speaker's voice is thickly guttural,
almost unintelligible as it issues
from the heavy Halaklava helmet
which covers his head and face ex
cept for narrow inch-wide slits over
his eyes.
"Heinar, he is all right? Poor boy,
he is so young. He told them he
was 22, but he will not shave for
three years more."
"I think Heinar will never need a
razor. He has 100 many bullets in
him now. What do they think, we
Finns are not supermen."
The man slumped back to his
sitting position, his hroad hack
again covering the blunt nose of
die machine gun hidden beneath
I lie tree.
"How many Russians did we
kill tonight?"
"Maybe 500. They cannot fight.
When we shoot they stop and try
to hide in the snow. But there are
so many of them and no more of
us."
The sullen roar of motors was
heard through the blast of the storm
and the men peered upward toward
the airplanes. Nothing could be
seen.

<•4 do they go. Why can
they not stop bombing Vii
puri? They have been there seven
eight. times tonight. Maybe my wife
and son are still there. Why can

"It makes no difference. Viipuri
will fall. And when it docs the
Russians can sweep through Fin
land."
The first man turned and patted
(lie muzzle of (he gun behind
him.
"They do not while I have this.
Besides, I hear that England will
help us."
"What do you know? You have
been on the front six weeks. The
English cannot come. Sweden will
not let them through and King
Gustav is afraid."
The men lapsed again into silence,
too tired even to think. When would
help come?
Then one cursed.
"Quick, they come again."
Three pulled themselves to their
feet. The fourth sat still. The first
man leaned down and shook his
shoulder rorghly . . . and a great
red stain blotted the front of the
sitting man's uniform.

dled behind the scant shelter of
an uprooted fir tree. Knifing
through the branches and whistling
above their heads, a raging blizzard
pushed great blobs of snow through

bodies were pushed closely together
for warmth, and one wearily lifted
a mittened hand to push the snow
from four rifles which were almost
covered by a rapidly-forming drift.

almost unintelligible as it issues
from the heavy Halaklava helmet
which covers his head and face ex
cept for narrow inch-wide slits over
his eyes.
"Heinar, he is all right? Poor boy,
he is so young. He told them he
was 22, but he will not shave for
three years more."
"I think Heinar will never need a
razor. He has 100 many bullets in
him now. What do they think, we
Finns are not supermen."
The man slumped back to his
sitting position, his hroad hack
again covering the blunt nose of
die machine gun hidden beneath
I lie tree.
"How many Russians did we
kill tonight?"
"Maybe 500. They cannot fight.
When we shoot they stop and try
to hide in the snow. But there are
so many of them and no more of
us."
The sullen roar of motors was
heard through the blast of the storm
and the men peered upward toward
the airplanes. Nothing could be
seen.

<•4 do they go. Why can
they not stop bombing Vii
puri? They have been there seven
eight. times tonight. Maybe my wife
and son are still there. Why can
we do nothing?"
"It makes no difference. Viipuri
will fall. And when it docs the
Russians can sweep through Fin
land."
The first man turned and patted
(lie muzzle of (he gun behind
him.
"They do not while I have this.
Besides, I hear that England will
help us."
"What do you know? You have
been on the front six weeks. The
English cannot come. Sweden will
not let them through and King
Gustav is afraid."
The men lapsed again into silence,
too tired even to think. When would
help come?
Then one cursed.
"Quick, they come again."
Three pulled themselves to their
feet. The fourth sat still. The first
man leaned down and shook his
shoulder rorghly . . . and a great
red stain blotted the front of the
sitting man's uniform.
Heinar was dead.
