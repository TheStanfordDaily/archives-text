# Crazy Characters, Nonsense Add Hilarity to English Play
## 
### 
George Bernard Shaw achieves comic effect by making sense nonsense.
Gerald Savcry, contrariwise, makes sense out of nonsense to bring in the
laughs. So it is with "George and Margaret."
According to Director Strickland, this is not a play about "dilly"
people, but rather one about intelligent but tense personalities, who work

themselves up over any subject of
momentary interest.
This is best illustrated by the
character of Alice, the mother,
played by Sylvia Onesti. She por
trays the fluttery type of woman
whose agile mind jumps like a flea
from subject to subject, and who
can work herself into hysterics over
something, and forget about it the
next minute.
MANHUNTING DAUGHTER
The play revolves about the fem
inine efforts of Frankie played by
Mary McClerkin, screwy daughter of
a cuckoo family, who is out. to get
her man. When all her tricks fail,
Malcolm, the father, played by Dana
Winters, hauls out a new angle and
pulls her through.
The part of Beer, the new maid,
by Barbara Sweetland, is conceded
by most critics to be the funniest
part in the whole play. But Beer
isn't seen until the third act, and
she never says a word.
NO TITLE ROLES
In most plays the title roles are
the most, important. In Savory's
comedy, George and Margaret are
ever-present, though they are never
seen or heard throughout the whole
performance. The part of a maid is
usually comic. In "George and
Margaret" the maid Gladys, Nancy
Burkett, is the only sensible char
acter.
Other roles are Dudley, played by
Quentin Warren; Claude, Asher
Wilson; and Roger, Ted Marcuse.
Swinging into the last rehearsals
this week-end, the play is complete
except for the finishing polish, ac
cording to Mr. Strickland.
