SEEK 'FREE' FUNDS
The idea of a Fund Drive is new
at Stanford, according to Peck. In
augurated on the Farm just four
years ago at alumni instigation, it
seeks to provide "un-earmarked"
dollars to solve the most pressing
needs of the University budget.
And the record of past contribu
tions is impressive. While the Farm's
annual appeal does not rival that of
Harvard or Yale, which have been
in operation for years, it provides a
valuable assistance to over-loaded
academic budgets. In 1937, the first
year of the drive, $32,142 was con
tributed by alumni. Last year that
total had climbed to $48,126. This
year Stanford Associates expect to
net still further aid for the school.
CALLERS LISTED
Jack Burns, one of the aides in the
drive, said yesterday that Larry
Dee, Dud Smith, Jesse Hazlett, Bob
Breckner, Jim McKeller, Nancy
Morse, Virginia Dean, Libby East
man, Lee Allen, and Jean Crook had
been selected to assist him.
Jack Ditz, John Bates, Harold
Barnard, John Cooper were named
as callers by Howard Hickingboth
am. Bob Anderson announced that
John Curran, By Carlson, John Wil
son, Peter Whittlesy, and Pat Ber
nard had been added to the list of
drive callers.
