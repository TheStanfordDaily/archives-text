## P.A.A. Pilot Asserts Bayoneted Guns Used To Force Inspection

WASHINGTON, Feb. 22 (UP).—
British seizure of trans-Atlantic
U. S. air mail at gunpoint was
called "a hell of a note" by Sena
tor Harry a. Truman, D., Mo.,
today, and Senator Lewis B.
Schwellcnbacb, I)., Wash., warned
Britain that continued interfer
ence with American neutral rights
may lose them (his nation's friend
ship and sympathy.
Fresh resentment over Allied
blockade control measures resounded
in Capitol corridors following dis
closure that British censorship offi
cials in Bermuda had used bayonet
fixed rifles to force Captain Charles
Lorber of Pan-American Airways to
permit them to examine his Clipper
plane mail cargo.

Truman demanded the State De
partment take drastic steps to pre
vent recurrences of this nature.
"I think that's a hell of a note," he
exploded. "I think we ought to stop
the whole business of sending our
planes over there—and I'm not neu
tral. Just stop the Clippers from
running until the British have
learned to behave themselves, and
stop their ships from landing in our
ports."
NO STATE DEPT. COMMENT
Schwellenbach, ardent administra
tionist and a member of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, said
he did not regard the incident as
"very much worse" than others. He
added "it is an indication of the
extent to which England will go in
her attitude toward neutrals."
"If England doesn't watch out, she
will bring about a definite antago
nism on the part of our people to
ward herself," he asserted.
The State Department withheld
comment, but it was learned there'
had been no mention of the use of
force in previous reports which it
received regarding the Jan. 18 inci
dent. It was doubted any formal
protest would be made.
