# 'Stop Payment on Checks, Erwin Requests, as Police Seek Union Safe Robbers
## Thieves Break into Cellar Early Wednesday Morning, Carry Away 200-pound Safe Containing $1,600 
### 
A request that all students who cashed checks at the Union Cellar last
Tuesday stop payment at their hanks immediately was voiced yesterday
by Ernest S. Erwin, assistant comptroller of the University, as an after
math to the $1.(500 burglary of the Stanford Union early Wednesday

.morning.
An unknown number of thieves
entered the Union some time be
tween midnight and 4:.'50 o'clock
Wednesday morning, opened the iron
grill-work fence which leads into
the Cellar, and took a 200-pound
safe from the cashier's office. The
safe contained the entire day's in
take plus a $500 revolving fund.
The loss is fully covered by in
surance.
SAFE STILL MISSING
No trace of the missing safe or its
contents had turned up last night.
The burglars left no clues, though
police are cheeking for possible fin
gerprints. The tile stairway was
marked by the safe as they dragged
it toward the door.
The burglary was reported by
E. M. House, Cellar custodian, to
William Hogan, night watchman,
when the latter made his rounds
early Wednesday morning. House
was working in the Cellar during
the early morning, and apparently
was there while the burglary took
place, according to Fred Frehe,
campus officer. It seemed probable
that the thieves watched his move
ments and chose a time when he
was in another part of the building
to make their raid.
MAIN DOOR LOCKED
The main door to the Cellar was
locked at the 11 o'clock closing
time, officials said. But the en
trance from Union Court and the
side door by the barber shop were
open. The iron grill leading to the
cashier's office was not locked, ac
cording to reports.
The San Jose sheriff's office and
University police are co-operating
on the case, but have turned up no
evidence so far. University police in
dicated yesterday that "several
suspects were under questioning,"
and that the burglary looked like
an inside job by a person or persons
familiar with the layout of the
Cellar.
$1,600 TO $1,700 STOLEN
There was a large amount of
checks in the safe, but it was be
lieved the bulk of the loot was in
cash. The amount stolen was con
sidered a normal day's receipts at
the Union. Reports were that be
tween $1,000 and $1,700 was taken.
Officers pointed out. more than
one man was implicated in the job,
as a single person would have had
great difficulty moving the safe. It
was the first major burglary at
Stanford. An attempt to crack, the
Bookstore safe ten years ago failed.
