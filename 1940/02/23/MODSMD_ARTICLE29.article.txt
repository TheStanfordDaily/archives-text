BERKELEY, Feb. 22 (UP). —Dr.
Stanley Freeborn, assistant dean of
the University of California's Col
lege of Agriculture, today warned
that California's migrant problem
may multiply rapidly in the near fu
ture if Negroes start coming in
from the deep South.
"California already is carrying a
tremendous burden of migrants
from other states," said Dr. Free
born. "But the current problem is
nothing compared to what it might
be if a migration of Negroes started
in the South where there are 8 to
10 men for every job."
Figures obtained by the university
show an increase of 344 per cent in
migrants in eight San Joaquin Val
ley counties in the last two years.
He said California's higher relief
payments were largely responsible
for attracting the migrants from
other states.
