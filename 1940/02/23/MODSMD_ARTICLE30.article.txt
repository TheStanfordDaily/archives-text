# 'Cook's Tour' of Lagunita Reveals Culinary Marvels
## Kitchen Stall Works Night and Day To Feed Dorm's 260 Ravenous Girls 
### ROSEMARIE MULLANY 
Two hundred and sixty guests for dinner.
Against a background of white enamel and gleaming steel, the Lagunita
kitchen stall deftly advances cm this staggering prospect which material
izes at (>:l5 o'clock each evening.
"Oh, it's not so hard," protested smiling Mrs. Velma Cornell, head cook

and immediate supervisor of
nary operations.
WITHOUT FUSS
Her remark was well evidenced. J
With the deadline little more than |
an hour away eight white-garbed ]
members of the force performed j
their tasks with a minimum of ef- i
fort or strain. The elements of j
drudgery, rush and uncertainty I
were absent.
While pantry-woman Margaret \
Melville expertly turned shiny, red ;
gelatine molds on to green lettuce j
leaves, Clarence Sexton, jovial sec- i
ond cook, stood by supervising the !
job.
'"How's this?" he exclaimed sud- j
denly, striking a typical cook's at
titude with two knives crossed be- '
fore him for the benefit of The j
Daily photographer.
MRS. LEIIAN DIRECTS
In front of a wall completely ob- j
scured by a row of refrigerators,
assistants set four long pans of |
steaming golden banana squash on J
the flat surface of the .stove where)
they awaited seasoning. On the I
other side of the immense kitchen, |
fresh pineapples were losing their j
tough hides. Close by, anotherj
member of the kitchen corps was j
dressing meat for the approaching I
meal.
Behind this obviously smooth- i
running organization is Mrs. Erna B. j
Lehan, dining hall director. From
her petite, homelike office just off
the kitchen, she oversees and par- j
ticipates in the whole procedure: !
menu-planning (files from years j
back are kept for reference and to j
avoid repetition), ordering, hiring
and firing, planning and carrying
out festive decorations for the din
ing room.
HOLIDAY THEMES
"We do try not to forget the holi
days," she remarked, fingering a!
small red, white, and blue place
card standing on her desk. "Last
year, for days before the Christmas
dinner, I kept the kitchen staff busy
cutting out tin foil angels."
Activity in the kitchen starts at 5 j
or 6 o'clock when the cooks arrive, i
They work until after lunch, leave
and come back again at 3 o'clock to
start preparations for dinner.
''Sometimes the bakers arrive
earlier in the morning," said Mrs.
Lehan, "because practically all hot

breads, pastries and rolls are made
in our own kitchen, with the excep
tion of loaf bread.
"There are deliveries of produce
locally twice every day," she con
tinued. "Meat, comes daily from the
city and there are four big deliveries
of produce from the city each week.
We use fresh fruits and vegetables
as much as possible, depending on
the season and prevailing prices."
Mrs. Lehan, who has held her
present position since Lagunita was
opened in 1934, also furnished fig
ures indicating the large-scale food
consumption which must be planned
on: per week. 272 gallons of milk, 228
pounds of butter, and 192 dozen eggs
are ordered. More staple foods are
ordered in large quantities and
kept on hand to meet the need.
