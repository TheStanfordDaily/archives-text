dent on the Stanford campus since I

Club in the Nitery.
"There is no reason why there'
should be loss of life due to reck- j
less driving, either," he continued, i
"if all of us follow common rules of;
courtesy and sanity." Ho urged 1
students to take a few seconds more I
to get to their destinations.
Questioned about the 25-mile-an- :
hour speed limit on Palm Drive, he !
surprised his audience by stating :

miles an hour to save just a min- ■
ute's driving time on the road.
