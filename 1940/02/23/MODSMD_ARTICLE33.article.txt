PLANKS ANI) PLATFORMS . . .
Are what politicians stand upon '
when up for election, and then they i
go about their merry way breaking !
them with reckless abandon once in ,
office. Before Volume 97 gets too j
far along .Slants figures it's about I
time to establish a few tenets upon j
which its policy will be governed i
between now and June.
Slants doesn't believe in firing j
verbal broadsides or salvos just to '
be at odds with any person or gen- ;
eral campus opinion. But when it j
believe.'- that the athletic set-up can I
be successfully remedies by a few j
words then it will be out in front j
taking stands trying to improve the i
situations.

SOME IDEAS . . .
Which Slants may express pos- j
sibly may be at odds with your own. |
First of all. this column would like |
to encourage any "Letters to the !
Sports Editor." If the athletically !
concerned readers have any pot
gripes or opinions agreeing or dis
agreeing with Slants, we'd like to
have 'em write in and tell us about
them.
Our idea is to devote a single col
umn as often as we can to excerpts
from letters to Slants. That way we
can get ideas of student athletic
opinion, whether it concerns the
8.A.C., attitude at campus games, or
just general chatter about what you
think we ought to know.

THE B.A.C. . . .
May have its faults—or what we
may think are faults—-but by and
large it conducts Stanford's ath
letic program remarkably well when
you stop to consider handicaps of
location, aid to athletes, etc.
There are a half a dozen persons !
in the B.A.C. with whom we'll try I
to help as problems warrant. There's j
Al Masters, graduate manager, and !
Don Liebendorfer, publicity expert, |
with whom we'll be glad to work if !
they think we can smooth over a j
few wrinkles.
Professor W. B. Owens, of the law I
school and president of the N.C.2A. I
and Stanford representative ol the j
P.C.C., will see lit, we hope, to let i
us help in the straightening out of j
the new Atherton Code for the con- j
ference.
j
WE CANT UNDO . . .
Any of those five-year contracts
the B.A.C. has tendered to new J
iootball head man, Clark Shaugh- j
nessy, nor to Frank (Pitch) John
son. who'll take over track duties
next fall. We regret, however, that
W. B. (Bill to us trackmen) Elling- j
ton wasn't given any sort of a l
chance to prove his worth as head I
track coach before the B.A.C. signed '
a new one.
MAJOR SPORTS . . .
Are foot ball, basketball, track and 1
baseball, but only the grid and cage !
sports seem to capture the fancy of
Staniord's athletic minded. Both
track and baseball teams have what
it takes to come damn close to win
ning titles this year.
What we'd like to do is promote
a little more interest in these for
gotten sports. Can't you just see j
how much better Capt. Clyde Jef- '<
Ircy will run with a women's root- '
ing section piercing the din, and!
"Cootie" Thompson mowing 'em j
down with the gals behind him on !
(•very pitch?
STRANGE. TOO . . .
It seems that the Sunken Dia- j
mond, the best college field on the |
Coast and perhaps the nation,
houldn t be filled week after week
when the horse-hiders continue to
smack down semi-pro teams. It's
really a well-balanced club.
On the other hand, Angell Field
11 ackmen who have angled for a new
set ol bleachers for over a year have
had to run to practically empty
stands.
There ain't no justice, say track
slers and baseballers.

THAT'S ALL . . .
For now. We sort of got off onto I
tangents at times but at least you ;
have a hazy idea of what we're go- j
ing to plug in this column.
