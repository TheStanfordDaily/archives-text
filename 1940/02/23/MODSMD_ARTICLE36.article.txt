# Strong Modesto Five Tests Frosh Basketballers Tonight
## 
### 
Stanford's once-beaten frosh bas- I
ketball team will meet their tough- j
est test of the year tonight at 6:30 |
o'clock. The tilt will be a prelimi- !
nary to the Varsity-U.S.C. battle. In
another prelim tomorrow at the ;
same time, the frosh will face Lowell
High of San Francisco.
Modesto, one of the strongest fives
in the Northern California J. C. loop,
hung up a convincing 45-38 trounc
ing on the Cal frosh last week-end. I
Since Stanford's freshmen barely
managed to nip the Bear Cubs by j
one point in their first battle two
weeks ago, there is plenty to scare ;
Coach Beeb Lee tonight.
FORWARDS FAST
Two slippery forwards, Jacobson 1
and Hale, paced the Modesto boys i
against Cal with 16 and 13 points, j
respectively. Lee will probably put
Lee McCaffrey and Walt Funabiki
at guards to stop these two.
Ed Voss, center, and Freddie
Linari and Jack Dana, forwards, j
have been working with these two
in practice sessions on the first- j
string line-up and will probably j
start tonight. Big Ed Stamm will i
help Voss with the pivot duties.
LOWELL HIGH STRONG
Lowell High is one of the stronger j
of the city high school clubs, but it j
dropped a 31-21 decision to flu Cal j

yearlings last week. The two games
this week-end will be the Papoose
five's final tussles until their con
cluding two-game series with Cal's
frosh next Friday and Saturday.
Coach Lee's men have hung up an
enviable record so far with the
only defeat in a dozen frays coming
at the hands of Menlo J. C. several
weeks ago.
