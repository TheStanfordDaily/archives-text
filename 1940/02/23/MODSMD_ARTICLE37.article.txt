## 
### 
Because of the wet weather, to
day's baseball game between the
Stanford freshmen and Santa Rosa
J. C. here has been postponed until
tomorrow morning at 9:30 o'clock.
Coach Harry Shipkey said that the
tilt will probably be cancelled if
any more rain falls today or tonight.
Pitcher Phil Wolf will hurl for the
frosh tomorrow, and if there is no
game, he will start against San Jose
High here next Saturday. The Pap

this year and is still looking lor

tryside in the winter to keep deer
and elk healthy.
