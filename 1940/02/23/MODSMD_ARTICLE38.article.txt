## Fans May See Pitchers' Duel In Circuit Till 
### 
With a .500 aveiage for five prac
tice games, Stanford's varsity dia- j
mondmen will travel to Santa Clara j
tomorrow to play their first league
game against the high-flying Bronc
os. Undefeated in five straight ;
games, the Santa Clarans are being
hailed already as the best nine to j
represent that school in many a '
year.
A pitcher's battle is in prospect
for the Pruneville diamond tomor
row, with "Cootie" Thompson slated j
to start on the mound for the Wol- j
termen and "Lefty" Collins, ace j
Bronco southpaw, likely to get the |
call for the home club.
The Broncos walloped a strong j
St. Mary's nine, 8-3, last Sunday in (
the first league game of the season. |
Tuesday they became the first local 1
college team to take the measure ol j
the Kenealy Seals, strong San Fran- j
cisco All-Star nine that tied the
Cards the day before, 4-4.
STARTERS NAMED
Alex Cereghino, hard-hitting Farm j
center fielder, will not start if Col- j
