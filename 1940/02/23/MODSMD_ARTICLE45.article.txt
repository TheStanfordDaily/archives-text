# Partisan Relief

WTT'VERY cent of every dollar goes directly
J_i to Stanford University and is to be used
to meet the most pressing needs of the year."
That's the slogan or watchword of this year's
Stanford Fund Drive, the fourth annual alumni
effort to keep the Farm in the select group of
privately endowed schools. In 1937, the drive
netted $32,142; last year, it netted $48,126. The
three-year total is nearly $120,000.
The Stanford Fund Drive, moreover, has never
attempted high-pressure or forceful donations.
Too many of our local money-raising activities
unfortunately have resorted to personal ridicule
and "don't be a heel" campaigns. For anyone
who has been in attendance here for more
than a year, it hardly seems necessary to men
tion these extortion plots by specific name.
But this Fund drive is definitely advanta
geous. We get every cent of it ourselves. That
naturally makes it a strictly partisan gesture and
might make some of our more benevolent com
patriots guite vexed at us again. The idea of
us furnishing workers and moral support for a
drive that won't buy an ounce of ammunition
for Finland, Poland, China, or anyone else who
should suddenly be oppressed, might be down
right absurd. Yet it's going to keep and bring
some of the better professors to Stanford, it's
going to buy eguipment and supplies for every
school and department; in other words we and
our alumni are attempting to maintain the Farm
at the top of the heap as long as it is humanly
possible.
The only way to build that kind of reputation
and respect is by soliciting and then obtaining
large grants-in-aid. Any undergraduate or
alumnus, who likes to see Stanford as "King of
the Mountain" but does not like the idea of a
drive for support, is cordially invited to suggest
a better way to glean the necessary simoleons.
Those who do not like Stanford in the first place
don't make enough difference in the long run
for us to bother with them.
The nice thing about the Stanford Fund Drive
is that the undergraduates contribute primarily
through furnishing the man - power for the
house-to-house canvass for two days and two
nights. These callers get nothing except a
goodly share of personal satisfaction and per
haps a chance at ringing door-bells with one of
the campus beauties.
So don't sell short the finest pursuit of
all the endeavors of the Stanford Associates.
They're pulling for Stanford, and besides they
won't club anyone over the head with a
bludgeon or cry shame-shame at those unable
or unwilling to contribute.
May their tribe increase.

The Stanford Fund Drive, moreover, has never
attempted high-pressure or forceful donations.
Too many of our local money-raising activities
unfortunately have resorted to personal ridicule
and "don't be a heel" campaigns. For anyone
who has been in attendance here for more
than a year, it hardly seems necessary to men
tion these extortion plots by specific name.
But this Fund drive is definitely advanta
geous. We get every cent of it ourselves. That
naturally makes it a strictly partisan gesture and
might make some of our more benevolent com
patriots guite vexed at us again. The idea of
us furnishing workers and moral support for a
drive that won't buy an ounce of ammunition
for Finland, Poland, China, or anyone else who
should suddenly be oppressed, might be down
right absurd. Yet it's going to keep and bring
some of the better professors to Stanford, it's
going to buy eguipment and supplies for every
school and department; in other words we and
our alumni are attempting to maintain the Farm
at the top of the heap as long as it is humanly
possible.
The only way to build that kind of reputation
and respect is by soliciting and then obtaining
large grants-in-aid. Any undergraduate or
alumnus, who likes to see Stanford as "King of
the Mountain" but does not like the idea of a
drive for support, is cordially invited to suggest
a better way to glean the necessary simoleons.
Those who do not like Stanford in the first place
don't make enough difference in the long run
for us to bother with them.
The nice thing about the Stanford Fund Drive
is that the undergraduates contribute primarily
through furnishing the man - power for the
house-to-house canvass for two days and two
nights. These callers get nothing except a
goodly share of personal satisfaction and per
haps a chance at ringing door-bells with one of
the campus beauties.
So don't sell short the finest pursuit of
all the endeavors of the Stanford Associates.
They're pulling for Stanford, and besides they
won't club anyone over the head with a
bludgeon or cry shame-shame at those unable
or unwilling to contribute.
May their tribe increase.
WTT'VERY cent of every dollar goes directly
J_i to Stanford University and is to be used
to meet the most pressing needs of the year."
That's the slogan or watchword of this year's
Stanford Fund Drive, the fourth annual alumni
effort to keep the Farm in the select group of
privately endowed schools. In 1937, the drive
netted $32,142; last year, it netted $48,126. The
three-year total is nearly $120,000.
