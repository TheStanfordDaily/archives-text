## DISCRIMINATION 
### 
r rHE EDITOR. SIR:
As this is National Negro History week, I think
that it is fitting for us to consider the situation of the
American Negro.
Negro slave labor was the basis of Southern econ
omy before the Civil War. The Negro people testified
to their hatred of this system by constant rebellion
prior to, and during the war. Under the leadership of
Frederic Douglass, .they were an indispensable factor
in the democracy victory of 1865.
After the war, traitors in the North combined with
the ruling class of the South to crush Negro attempts
at democracy. Since then they have been discrimi
nated against in every possible way. The Negro has
legal equality (usually unenforceable) without any
chance for political, social, or economic equality. It is
only in a very few fields that Negroes have had any
chance to reveal their great capacities. American
music is enormously indebted to such splendid musi
cians as Paul Robeson and Marion Anderson.
Modern jazz is founded on the work of Negroes and
is almost their own creation. In sports the accomplish
ments of Joe Lotus, Kenny Washington, Jesse Owens,
Henry Armstrong, and Jackie Robinson, to mention
only a few, speak for their capabilities.

A notorious example of racial prejudice such us the
Scottsboro case is an affront to all Americans whether
they be black or white. Discrimination destroys the
foundations of democracy. In defense of our own free
dom, we must make sure that the Negroes and other
minority groups enjoy democratic liberties. We must
recognize that the Negroes, despite extremely limited
opportunities, are an integral part of American life
and culture. We will all gain when these opportunities
are broadened.
Sincerely yours,
Dick Cecil
