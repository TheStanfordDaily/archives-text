# BARBARA'S DOLLS
## 
### 
r |MIE EDITOR, SIR:
Last Friday after reading your editorial, Barbara
Murphy was somewhat surprised to find that Barbara
Murphy was among those gone from the Stanford
campus. Her policy was always doing or dying for
the dear old Farm. At present she is actively engaged
in the latter with her role as nursemaid and house
mother to nine very unattractive (we think, but then
what is our modest opinion against that of thousands
of others?) dolls at Elm Cottage (propaganda).
Elm Cottage, in case any of you are interested, is
that leaky-roofed shack to which they threaten to
send untidy Robleites. It is pleasantly situated in the
backyard of the deceivingly facaded S.A.E. mansion.
When we are not enjoying intermittent blackouts, at
tributable to the perverted S.A.E. sense of humor and
the easy accessibility of our light switch, the Chinese
on the other flank are continually celebrating New
Year's Eve at odd intervalsâ€”when the S.A.E.'s aren't.
Love,
Those Elmites (not to be
confused with termites)
