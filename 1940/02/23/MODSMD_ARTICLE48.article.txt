### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
GONE WITH TIIE WIND: $1.(55
a solid year a friend of mine heard sighs and
eulogies about Margaret Mitchell's literary thun
derbolt: "Gone With the Wind." For three more anx
iety-packed years my friend awaited the impending
paragon of cinematic drama: "Gone With the Wind."
Last night my friend saw "Gone With the Wind." And
this morning my friend is the most, disillusioned man
in shoe-leather. Gone with the wind are pipe-dreams
of artistry, pipe-dreams of a great story, and pipe
dreams of $1.65.
And the tragic thing about it all is that my friend
can't breathe a word of criticism under his own name.
Legions of Saint Margaret's zealots would hang him
to the nearest tree. Heaven preserve me—my friend's
malicious mouthpiece.
In justice to the director of "Gone With the Wind"
it must be said that he only had a four-and-a-half
hour show in which to cram every sentimental inci
dent that a woman can think of. He only had twice
as much film as the normal director in which to cover
everything from General Sherman's marauding to the
pangs of thrice-married love.
A great chronicle of the Old South, people say.
Yes, as a glorified pictorial of the Civil War days
M.G.M.'s technicolor did a fine job. But historical
accuracy is a poor excuse for a poor drama. And
drama is a bad name for a conglomeration of fortui
tous incidents that do not spring from character, but
only from the vast fund of trite sentimentalisms that
produce little girls' breaking their necks on horseback,
dying mothers, and six-year loves illogically resolved
in five minutes.
The characters, of course, have always been good.
* Ms * -Y-
Why shouldn't they be good now? We have the high
spirited girl (with green eyes) who is materialistic
but oh so strong; the "bad" man with a good heart, in
spite of his crudities; the dreaming, noble, weak man;
the proud Irish father who loves the land; and the self
effacing, Valjean-like, forgiving woman—too good to
live really. It is not amazing that the characters should
be trite. But it is amazing that one authoress could
have gathered so many of them in a scant thousand
pages.
Like "Anthony Adverse," "Gone With the Wind"
satisfies the public's four major appetites: (1) Excite
ment and sentiment by the' bushel—unconnected and
irrationally motivated. (2) Mildly risque humor-pas
sages that inspite this sort of thought: "There is naked
life—realistic life. But I'm so glad everything is ro
mantically glossed over; otherwise it would be crude."
(3) Profound philosophy like Scarlett's closing line—
spoken with those naughtily vital eyes raised heav
enward: "There is always tomorrow!" (4) The up
lifting feeling that the story is a real epic because it
has covered hundreds of disjointed events.
Please understand—all this is what a friend of
mine thought. Some of the rest of us might disagree
with him, mightn't we? Well, every man to his own
opinion, I always say. That's life, you know.

eulogies about Margaret Mitchell's literary thun
derbolt: "Gone With the Wind." For three more anx
iety-packed years my friend awaited the impending
paragon of cinematic drama: "Gone With the Wind."
Last night my friend saw "Gone With the Wind." And
this morning my friend is the most, disillusioned man
in shoe-leather. Gone with the wind are pipe-dreams
of artistry, pipe-dreams of a great story, and pipe
dreams of $1.65.
And the tragic thing about it all is that my friend
can't breathe a word of criticism under his own name.
Legions of Saint Margaret's zealots would hang him
to the nearest tree. Heaven preserve me—my friend's
malicious mouthpiece.
In justice to the director of "Gone With the Wind"
it must be said that he only had a four-and-a-half
hour show in which to cram every sentimental inci
dent that a woman can think of. He only had twice
as much film as the normal director in which to cover
everything from General Sherman's marauding to the
pangs of thrice-married love.
A great chronicle of the Old South, people say.
Yes, as a glorified pictorial of the Civil War days
M.G.M.'s technicolor did a fine job. But historical
accuracy is a poor excuse for a poor drama. And
drama is a bad name for a conglomeration of fortui
tous incidents that do not spring from character, but
only from the vast fund of trite sentimentalisms that
produce little girls' breaking their necks on horseback,
dying mothers, and six-year loves illogically resolved
in five minutes.
The characters, of course, have always been good.
* Ms * -Y-
Why shouldn't they be good now? We have the high
spirited girl (with green eyes) who is materialistic
but oh so strong; the "bad" man with a good heart, in
spite of his crudities; the dreaming, noble, weak man;
the proud Irish father who loves the land; and the self
effacing, Valjean-like, forgiving woman—too good to
live really. It is not amazing that the characters should
be trite. But it is amazing that one authoress could
have gathered so many of them in a scant thousand
pages.
Like "Anthony Adverse," "Gone With the Wind"
satisfies the public's four major appetites: (1) Excite
ment and sentiment by the' bushel—unconnected and
irrationally motivated. (2) Mildly risque humor-pas
sages that inspite this sort of thought: "There is naked
life—realistic life. But I'm so glad everything is ro
mantically glossed over; otherwise it would be crude."
(3) Profound philosophy like Scarlett's closing line—
spoken with those naughtily vital eyes raised heav
enward: "There is always tomorrow!" (4) The up
lifting feeling that the story is a real epic because it
has covered hundreds of disjointed events.
Please understand—all this is what a friend of
mine thought. Some of the rest of us might disagree
with him, mightn't we? Well, every man to his own
opinion, I always say. That's life, you know.
