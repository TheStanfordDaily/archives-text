# Lightly and Politely
## EARLY IN THE MORNING 
### DOUC JAQUES 
Waking up early in the morning, early when you
consider what time he went to bed, he rolled out of
bed.
Oh, my God, my head.
He groped for his cigarettes.
Where did I put my glasses? Why is brandy so
smooth the night before, and like this the next day?
He wished he were still asleep, or that he had a
real hangover, a whiskey hangover. Brandy left him
clogged up, and foggy. His head didn't hurt, it just
felt thick and slow.
He found his glasses, and beside them were 1 his car
key and a note. He stared at the note, not picking it
up, and then looked again for his cigarettes. He lit
one and went back to the note It was written by the
guy he had loaned his car to the night before.
"Dear Willy, don't be alarmed about your car," it
began.
Oh, my God.
"Some gasoline leaked from the carburetor and set
the exhaust on fire."
Is it fire insurance I have? How does it work? Oh,
my head.
"We wouldn't drive it home because it was too hot.
We left it at the Firehouse."
When he feels better he's going over to look at his
car.
