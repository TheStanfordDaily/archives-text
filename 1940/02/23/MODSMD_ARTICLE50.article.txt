She had a good dog, a really good dog, the kind of
a dog she would like have be a father.
One dav she saw a female dog of the same breed.
How would you like to be a father, she said to her
dog, and left him there with the female for an hour
or so.
During the hour she was quite happy. She prom
ised several of her friends first-rate puppies. She
found homes for all of them. Then she went back
and picked up her dog.
Some time later she found that she did not know
precisely how it is with canine love affairs.
