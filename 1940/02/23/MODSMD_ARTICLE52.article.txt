'•RAFFLES," with David Nivcn
and Olivia de Havillaiui, now play
ing at the Stanford.
j The devilishly clever machina
tions of Raffles, suave jewel thief,
are known to almost every devotee
of mystery stories, from reading
"The Amateur Cracksman" or from
the earlier film version of "Raffles,"
made in 1930 with Ronald Colman.
Samuel Goldwyn has dusted off
the old favorite, and under the di
rection of Sam Wood it emerges as a
pleasant, if not novel bit of enter
tainment. Although the yarn of the
altruistic gentleman who, like Robin
Hood, steals from the rich to help
his friends, has become somewhat
hackneyed with age, David Niven's
Rover Boy charm and good per
formances by the supporting cast
rescue it from the "also showing"
class.

A. J. Raffles, London man-about -
town and expert cricket player,
; amuses himself and pays his bills
by committing ingenious thefts that
utterly baffle Scotland Yardmen (as
usual), until he falls in love. Olivia
.deHavilland is'the girl, who causes

Raffles to swear oft his nefarious
pastime.
But soft-hearted Raffles, never
one to desert a friend in trouble, re
solves to steal an emerald necklace
in order to save Olivia's brother
from disgrace. The necklace belongs
to the hostess of a house-party.
Complications arLse when a rival
second-story man also tries to take
the gems.

Meanwhile Scotland Yard in the
person of Dudley Digges, has ar
rived on the scene. After that the
plot resolves itself into:

els?
2. Will he be caught?
Although by this time the audi
ence will have decided that Raffles
is infallible and Scotland Yard per
petually doomed to be baffled, the
whirlwind finish manages to provide
a few surprises.

the old favorite, and under the di
rection of Sam Wood it emerges as a
pleasant, if not novel bit of enter
tainment. Although the yarn of the
altruistic gentleman who, like Robin
Hood, steals from the rich to help
his friends, has become somewhat
hackneyed with age, David Niven's
Rover Boy charm and good per
formances by the supporting cast
rescue it from the "also showing"
class.
BAFFLES YARD'
A. J. Raffles, London man-about -
town and expert cricket player,
; amuses himself and pays his bills
by committing ingenious thefts that
utterly baffle Scotland Yardmen (as
usual), until he falls in love. Olivia
.deHavilland is'the girl, who causes

Raffles to swear oft his nefarious
pastime.
But soft-hearted Raffles, never
one to desert a friend in trouble, re
solves to steal an emerald necklace
in order to save Olivia's brother
from disgrace. The necklace belongs
to the hostess of a house-party.
Complications arLse when a rival
second-story man also tries to take
the gems.
PLOT THICKENS
Meanwhile Scotland Yard in the
person of Dudley Digges, has ar
rived on the scene. After that the
plot resolves itself into:
1. How will Raffles get the jew
els?
2. Will he be caught?
Although by this time the audi
ence will have decided that Raffles
is infallible and Scotland Yard per
petually doomed to be baffled, the
whirlwind finish manages to provide
a few surprises.
'"All Women Have Secrets," an in
volved yarn of married undergrad
uates, devotes itself to proving the
statement of one of the characters:
"Pretty girls and test-tubes are like
oil and water; they don't mix."—

j The devilishly clever machina
tions of Raffles, suave jewel thief,
