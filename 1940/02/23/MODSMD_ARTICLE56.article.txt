### 
LONDON, Feb. 22 (UP). â€” Two
explosions attributed by police to
the outlawed Irish Republican Army
occurred in the West End tonight,
injuring at least nine persons and
causing minor property damage.
After the explosions, the first in
London since the recent execution
of two I.RA. terrorists at Birming
ham, police began a systematic
search of telephone kiosks, letter
boxes, shop windows and under
ground stations for more bombs.
