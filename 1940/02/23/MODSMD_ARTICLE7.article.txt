# Mlle. Eve Curie To Speak Here
## Lecturer to Talk On 'Magic of Radium' 
### 
Lecturing is only one activity in
the varied career of Mile. Eve Curie,
who will speak to Stanford audiences
Monday, March 4, in Memorial Hall,
on "The Magic of Radium," Al
though not widely known in the
United States before the publication
of her biography of her mother, the
name of Eve Curie has long been
notable in cosmopolitan Paris.
Admitting that science overawed
her, Mile. Curie broke with family
tradition, when she turned from re
search to music and became a con
cert pianist.
Directing her talents to another
field, she wrote music criticism un
der a pen name for Paris papers.
Later she drifted into adapting
Broadway plays for the Paris stage;
"145 Wall Street," a Parisan success,
was Mile. Curie's version of the
American "Spread Eagle."
WRITES BIOGRAPHY
After her mother's death in 1934,
publishers persuaded Mile. Curie to
write the moving biography of the
discoverer of radium which became
a best seller in the United States.
Lecture tours in this country added
to her popularity and made Eve
Curie a celebrity in her own right.
At the beginning of the present
war, Mile. Curie was made coordi
nator and director of women's war
activities under the French Com
missariat of Information. As official
spokesman for all the women of
France, Mile. Curie served there
until granted a leave of absence to
come to the United States on her
current lecture tour.
BREAKS INTO NEWS
Two weeks ago Eve Curie came
into her own as a personality in the
news; Time Magazine, in publishing
her picture on its cover, acknowl
edged her as the Woman of the
Week, characterizing the distin
guished Frenchwoman-as "brilliant"
and "elegant."
"The Magic of Radium" is the
title of Mile. Curie's lecture.
