# Troy Battles Indian Five At 8 Tonight
## Anderson's Return Bolsters Card Team For Crucial Series 
### CHUCK SMITH 
They'll be here tonight: those
Terrible Trojans and their best-in
the-nation basketball team. Stan
ford's rooters have every reason to
believe that in at least one of the
week-end's two games Coach Ev
erett Dean's cagers will rise to the
heights they are capable of and
trip the mighty Trojan. In the first
place, they have never seen Dean's
proteges lose a game in the present
season on the Pavilion floor.
FORDY SPARKS ATTACK
A second and more important rea
son will be the presence of one For
rest Anderson, at the starting posi
tion at forward for the Cardinal
varsity. Fordy had become the
main cog in a point-crazy, fast
breaking team until he was struck
down by a "strep" throat just before
the first U.S.C. series.
Another strong argument in favor
of the Cardinal to upset S.C. at least
once is the spirit and zip the In
dians showed during practice this
week. Most of the team seemed to
iron out their difficulties at. the foul
line during the practice sessions.
SPIRITED SCRIMMAGE
In the scrimmage on Wednesday
which concluded the week's work in
preparation for U.S.C., the first and
second stringers scored at will on
quick breaks and on their set. of
fense plays, and stopped all imita
tions of Vaughn, McGarvin, etc., by
the resei*ves.
No longer can the Indian team be
called a five-man outfit. Now they
have, through the recent develop
ment of several players, plenty of
dependable subs. Of course, Bob
Penn and Leon Lafaille had already
been counted upon before the sea
son to play lots of good ball. But
unexpected, and certainly not un
welcome, has been the improvement
of the two second-string guards,
Bob Wensel and John Alltucker.
FLASHY FIRST STRING
As for that first string which will
open against Sam Barry's men to
night; they need plenty of superla
tives to describe them. At one guard
will be the conference's highest
scoring guard and undoubtedly the
smoothest eager on the coast, co»-
Captain Ken Davidson. His running
mate will be the best sophomore
ball player in the conference, Bill
Cowden.
At center will be the most im
proved and tallest hoopster of the
lot, Dick Taylor. At one forward
will be Don Williams, the highest In
dian scorer and the third highest
scorer in the league. And the other
forward will be Fordy Anderson,
who will be the fastest man on the
court.

breaking team until he was struck
down by a "strep" throat just before
the first U.S.C. series.
Another strong argument in favor
of the Cardinal to upset S.C. at least
once is the spirit and zip the In
dians showed during practice this
week. Most of the team seemed to
iron out their difficulties at. the foul
line during the practice sessions.
SPIRITED SCRIMMAGE
In the scrimmage on Wednesday
which concluded the week's work in
preparation for U.S.C., the first and
second stringers scored at will on
quick breaks and on their set. of
fense plays, and stopped all imita
tions of Vaughn, McGarvin, etc., by
the resei*ves.
No longer can the Indian team be
called a five-man outfit. Now they
have, through the recent develop
ment of several players, plenty of
dependable subs. Of course, Bob
Penn and Leon Lafaille had already
been counted upon before the sea
son to play lots of good ball. But
unexpected, and certainly not un
welcome, has been the improvement
of the two second-string guards,
Bob Wensel and John Alltucker.
FLASHY FIRST STRING
As for that first string which will
open against Sam Barry's men to
night; they need plenty of superla
tives to describe them. At one guard
will be the conference's highest
scoring guard and undoubtedly the
smoothest eager on the coast, co»-
Captain Ken Davidson. His running
mate will be the best sophomore
ball player in the conference, Bill
Cowden.
At center will be the most im
proved and tallest hoopster of the
lot, Dick Taylor. At one forward
will be Don Williams, the highest In
dian scorer and the third highest
scorer in the league. And the other
forward will be Fordy Anderson,
who will be the fastest man on the
court.
They'll be here tonight: those
Terrible Trojans and their best-in
the-nation basketball team. Stan
ford's rooters have every reason to
believe that in at least one of the
week-end's two games Coach Ev
erett Dean's cagers will rise to the
heights they are capable of and
trip the mighty Trojan. In the first
place, they have never seen Dean's
proteges lose a game in the present
season on the Pavilion floor.
FORDY SPARKS ATTACK
A second and more important rea
son will be the presence of one For
rest Anderson, at the starting posi
tion at forward for the Cardinal
varsity. Fordy had become the
main cog in a point-crazy, fast
breaking team until he was struck
down by a "strep" throat just before
the first U.S.C. series.
