### WILSON CANNON 
I Franklin and Cordell:
Things don't look so good for
that "peace mission" of yours, do
they? Evidently Adolf Hitler, Ne
ville Chamberlain, Albert Lebrun,
and the rest of the boys in Europe
aren't too enthusiastic about your
big idea. You surely must have no
ticed.
Maybe when you sent Under-
Secretary of State Sumner Welles
over there you expected everyone to
believe he really was going on an
observation tour, with a scheduled
scries of conferences in all the key
points of Europe merely a part of
the itinerary. Or did you throw in
that explanation just to fool those
persons who believe that America
should keep it.s nose completely out
of European affairs?
At any rate, it seems to be al
most public gossip around these
parts that Mr. Welles was sent
with the definite purpose of at
tempting to effect some sort of a
compromise peace proposal among
the warring powers of Europe.
And the hoys who run things on
that continent seem to have fig
ured things out along the same
lines.
Remember that rousing speech
Chamberlain gave two days ago in
England? Maybe he wasn't refer
ring to your man Welles at all, but
he wasnt' kidding when he said that
the Allies were determined to keep
going until what he termed "Hitler
ism" had been completely wiped
from the face of the European con
tinent . . . even if Great Britain
had to apply the soap and water all
by herself.
Perhaps Chamberlain is still listen
ing to your assertions that the Welles
tour is purely an observation trip.
He might be glad to know what it is
all about. Better tell him before
lie sends his soldiers after any more
of our mail . . . somehow people
over here don't like that sort of
thing.

Y"ESTERDAY l' lo newspapers said
that the French are anxious to
receive Mr. Welles with as much
ceremony as war-time limitations
will allow. That sounded mighty
cheering, Mr. President, until we
read the next paragraph. That's
where they told you that if Mr.
Welles was doing anything except
"observing," he might as well pack
up his little peace treaties and start
back home.
Maybe 50 million Frenchmen
arc wrong about the matter, hut
they are all almost certain that
Welles is at least over there to
smooth the way for some media
tion effort that you two have up
your sleeves. As a matter of fact,
they were sure enough to prepare
a few "minimum essentials for
peace" for the Under-Secretary of
State to bring hack to you.
This sounds line. At least they
are interested enough to give you
two a working basis from which to
start. But their minimum demands
included restoration of the inde
pendence of Poland and Czechoslo
vakia, plus ample damages to be
paid by Germany for what they
termed war destruction and atroci
ties. What do you think Germany's
Fuehrer will say to that?

JJEMEMBER Hitler's speech at
Munich last week? His prom
ise to keep Germany's army on the
field until it had assured Nazi domi
nation on the continent; his demand
for more "living room" in more of
Germany's former colonies; and his
hints of a possible further expan
sion in new hemispheres after "Ger
many had won the war," certainly
didn't sound as though he was wait
ing for Mr. Welles with open arms.
But things might turn out after
all. You probably didn't hear about
Stanford's Finnish relief battle and
how it finally went through in great
shape. For a while Stanford was
afraid it might grease the skids that
*..ould send America into the war.
. . . but no one has heard any
complaints from Europe yet. Maybe
your plan for world peace will be
gin laying golden eggs.

persons who believe that America
should keep it.s nose completely out
of European affairs?
At any rate, it seems to be al
most public gossip around these
parts that Mr. Welles was sent
with the definite purpose of at
tempting to effect some sort of a
compromise peace proposal among
the warring powers of Europe.
And the hoys who run things on
that continent seem to have fig
ured things out along the same
lines.
Remember that rousing speech
Chamberlain gave two days ago in
England? Maybe he wasn't refer
ring to your man Welles at all, but
he wasnt' kidding when he said that
the Allies were determined to keep
going until what he termed "Hitler
ism" had been completely wiped
from the face of the European con
tinent . . . even if Great Britain
had to apply the soap and water all
by herself.
Perhaps Chamberlain is still listen

tour is purely an observation trip.
He might be glad to know what it is
all about. Better tell him before
lie sends his soldiers after any more
of our mail . . . somehow people
over here don't like that sort of

the Allies were determined to keep
going until what he termed "Hitler
ism" had been completely wiped
from the face of the European con
tinent . . . even if Great Britain
had to apply the soap and water all
by herself.
Perhaps Chamberlain is still listen
ing to your assertions that the Welles
tour is purely an observation trip.
He might be glad to know what it is
all about. Better tell him before
lie sends his soldiers after any more
of our mail . . . somehow people
over here don't like that sort of
thing.

Y"ESTERDAY l' lo newspapers said
that the French are anxious to
receive Mr. Welles with as much
ceremony as war-time limitations
will allow. That sounded mighty
cheering, Mr. President, until we
read the next paragraph. That's
where they told you that if Mr.
Welles was doing anything except
"observing," he might as well pack
up his little peace treaties and start
back home.
Maybe 50 million Frenchmen
arc wrong about the matter, hut
they are all almost certain that
Welles is at least over there to
smooth the way for some media
tion effort that you two have up
your sleeves. As a matter of fact,
they were sure enough to prepare
a few "minimum essentials for
peace" for the Under-Secretary of
State to bring hack to you.
This sounds line. At least they
are interested enough to give you
two a working basis from which to
start. But their minimum demands
included restoration of the inde
pendence of Poland and Czechoslo
vakia, plus ample damages to be
paid by Germany for what they
termed war destruction and atroci
ties. What do you think Germany's
Fuehrer will say to that?
4* * il«
JJEMEMBER Hitler's speech at
Munich last week? His prom
ise to keep Germany's army on the
field until it had assured Nazi domi
nation on the continent; his demand
for more "living room" in more of
Germany's former colonies; and his
hints of a possible further expan
sion in new hemispheres after "Ger
many had won the war," certainly
didn't sound as though he was wait
ing for Mr. Welles with open arms.
But things might turn out after
all. You probably didn't hear about
Stanford's Finnish relief battle and
how it finally went through in great
shape. For a while Stanford was
afraid it might grease the skids that
*..ould send America into the war.
. . . but no one has heard any
complaints from Europe yet. Maybe
your plan for world peace will be
gin laying golden eggs.
Sincerely yours,
History, 1940
