# Fagan's Hat Manufacturers Make Econ Points Easier
## 
### JACK BURTT 
Popping energetically from one end of the lecture platform to the other,
hands gesturing feverishly, Professor Fagan creates Mexican laborers
making Panama hats.
"And this little Mexican laborer making Panama hats, and this little
Mexican laborer making Panama hats, and this little Mexican laborer
Panama hats . .

In no time a small army of little
Mexican lalx>rers is engaged in the
production of Panama hats. The
class understands that here is an ex
cellent illustration of the growth of
an industry, complete with such
data as decreasing and then increas
ing marginal costs. And the class also
understands economics a little better
thereby.
PRODUCES WIDGETS
Abruptly, his point across, the
agile professor strangles the busy
Mexicans with an ATUC curve and
tosses them of! the rostrum to make
way for the next number on the
program—the "widgets."
Widgets are easier to produce than
Mexican laborers—they require no
manual demonstration, so he just
announces them. Now a widget is
actually an arbitrary unit of pro
duction, but. it's much more fun to
call it a "widget."
In a trice a large factory has been
set to manufacturing widgets by the
carload. The class is shown what
happens when all these widgets hit
the market, under given conditions
of supply and demand, under condi
| tions of perfect and imperfect cotn

j GEOMETRICAL METHOD
1 "Now this is what happens to the
J unit cost of production of widgets
when we add units of input!"
The long arms stretch frantically,
the blackboard is quickly cross
hatched with a sweeping series of
curves. It's called the geometrical
method of demonstration, and is al
legedly useful in explaining coni-
I plex economic problems.
But, in spite of the Mexican la
borers and the widgets, Professor
Elmer D. (for Daniel) Fagan has no
teaching method. Or so he says.
HAS NO SYSTEM
"I have no conscious system," he
! asserts. "It just happens. I try only
I to know enough about the subject
| to keep students interested."
Twelve years in the Stanford eco
nomics department have proved the
| efficacy of his "methodless" dra-
I matic teaching of economies. Stu
i dents, from wide-eyed sophomores
to worldly graduates, are amazed at
: his quick classroom repartee, re
i spectful of his authority, periodically
j convulsed by his un-selfconscious,
graphic examples. And they all
learn a heck of a lot of economics.
SUNDAY HORSE RACES
Most of Professor Fagan's life has
revolved around economics. The
works of Harvard's famed economist,
Frank William Taussig, first aroused
his interest. His ambition as early
as high school days in Kansas was
to attend Harvard and study under
the master.
The Fagan family had come to
' Kansas from the South. They
brought with them a Southern tradi
tion that, included a stable of fine
j horses. The native Kansans were a
j little shocked at Sunday horse races
on ihe Fagan track, but to young
I Elmer it was thrilling sport.
His chief extra-curricular activity
during his college years at Univer
sity of Oklahoma was dramatics.
While this training may be respon
-1 sible for his easy stage-presence in
the classroom, he is insistent that it \
has nothing to do with the manner
in which he teaches economics.
His dramatics experience did not, j
however, prevent stage-fright on the !
occasion oi his first lecture. The first
class lor every professor, like a !
pilot's solo flight, is a huge and some- 1
what frightening milestone at the!
outset of a career. Mr. Fagari passed
his with something bordering on the j
sensational.
STUDENT STUMPS HIM
The young instructor, walked into !
the classroom, his knees shaking \
just a little, and laid his impressive, j
black briefcase on the lecture stand
with a flourish calculated to reveal
long experience. Eut a student in i
the first row sized up the situation I
with hoxrible insight.
"Pretty proud of it, aren't you,;
Professor," he drawled, pointing to j
the briefcase.
His professorial dignity bespoiled, j
but with aplomb unruffled, the j
young instructor did the only thing j
left to do. He laughed out loud. The '
class followed his example and the |
ice was shattered.
WOWS EM SINCE
He's been wowing 'em ever since,
if a colloquialism may be permitted
on .so academic an issue.
But it must not be presumed that
Professor Fagan's bon mots are his j
chief pastime. They are spontane- |
ous incidentals, undoubtedly arising |
from his real joy of living. His chief j
work is still economics.
In the field of taxation, primarily I
in the relationship between fiscal |
policy and the business cycle, he is
an important authority. He has pub- |
lished frequent papers in such as- :
tute periodicals as the "Journal of |
Political Economy" and the "Quar- j
terly Economic Journal." His papers j
may be fovind in the proceedings of,
important conventions of economic j
associations.

i spectful of his authority, periodically
j convulsed by his un-selfconscious,
graphic examples. And they all
learn a heck of a lot of economics.
SUNDAY HORSE RACES
Most of Professor Fagan's life has
revolved around economics. The
works of Harvard's famed economist,
Frank William Taussig, first aroused
his interest. His ambition as early
as high school days in Kansas was
to attend Harvard and study under
the master.
The Fagan family had come to
' Kansas from the South. They
brought with them a Southern tradi
tion that, included a stable of fine
j horses. The native Kansans were a
j little shocked at Sunday horse races
on ihe Fagan track, but to young
I Elmer it was thrilling sport.
His chief extra-curricular activity
during his college years at Univer
sity of Oklahoma was dramatics.
While this training may be respon
-1 sible for his easy stage-presence in
the classroom, he is insistent that it \
has nothing to do with the manner
in which he teaches economics.
His dramatics experience did not, j
however, prevent stage-fright on the !
occasion oi his first lecture. The first
class lor every professor, like a !
pilot's solo flight, is a huge and some- 1
what frightening milestone at the!
outset of a career. Mr. Fagari passed
his with something bordering on the j
sensational.
STUDENT STUMPS HIM
The young instructor, walked into !
the classroom, his knees shaking \
just a little, and laid his impressive, j
black briefcase on the lecture stand
with a flourish calculated to reveal
long experience. Eut a student in i
the first row sized up the situation I
with hoxrible insight.
"Pretty proud of it, aren't you,;
Professor," he drawled, pointing to j
the briefcase.
His professorial dignity bespoiled, j
but with aplomb unruffled, the j
young instructor did the only thing j
left to do. He laughed out loud. The '
class followed his example and the |
ice was shattered.
WOWS EM SINCE
He's been wowing 'em ever since,
if a colloquialism may be permitted
on .so academic an issue.
But it must not be presumed that
Professor Fagan's bon mots are his j
chief pastime. They are spontane- |
ous incidentals, undoubtedly arising |
from his real joy of living. His chief j
work is still economics.
In the field of taxation, primarily I
in the relationship between fiscal |
policy and the business cycle, he is
an important authority. He has pub- |
lished frequent papers in such as- :
tute periodicals as the "Journal of |
Political Economy" and the "Quar- j
terly Economic Journal." His papers j
may be fovind in the proceedings of,
important conventions of economic j
associations.
Popping energetically from one end of the lecture platform to the other,
hands gesturing feverishly, Professor Fagan creates Mexican laborers
making Panama hats.
"And this little Mexican laborer making Panama hats, and this little
Mexican laborer making Panama hats, and this little Mexican laborer
Panama hats . .

In no time a small army of little
Mexican lalx>rers is engaged in the
production of Panama hats. The
class understands that here is an ex
cellent illustration of the growth of
an industry, complete with such
data as decreasing and then increas
ing marginal costs. And the class also
understands economics a little better
thereby.

But, in spite of the Mexican la
borers and the widgets, Professor
Elmer D. (for Daniel) Fagan has no
teaching method. Or so he says.
HAS NO SYSTEM
"I have no conscious system," he
! asserts. "It just happens. I try only
I to know enough about the subject
| to keep students interested."
Twelve years in the Stanford eco
nomics department have proved the
| efficacy of his "methodless" dra-
I matic teaching of economies. Stu
i dents, from wide-eyed sophomores
to worldly graduates, are amazed at
: his quick classroom repartee, re
i spectful of his authority, periodically
j convulsed by his un-selfconscious,
graphic examples. And they all
learn a heck of a lot of economics.
SUNDAY HORSE RACES
Most of Professor Fagan's life has
revolved around economics. The
works of Harvard's famed economist,
Frank William Taussig, first aroused
his interest. His ambition as early
as high school days in Kansas was
to attend Harvard and study under
the master.
The Fagan family had come to
' Kansas from the South. They
brought with them a Southern tradi
tion that, included a stable of fine
j horses. The native Kansans were a
j little shocked at Sunday horse races
on ihe Fagan track, but to young
I Elmer it was thrilling sport.
His chief extra-curricular activity
during his college years at Univer
sity of Oklahoma was dramatics.
While this training may be respon
-1 sible for his easy stage-presence in
the classroom, he is insistent that it \
has nothing to do with the manner
in which he teaches economics.
His dramatics experience did not, j
however, prevent stage-fright on the !
occasion oi his first lecture. The first
class lor every professor, like a !
pilot's solo flight, is a huge and some- 1
what frightening milestone at the!
outset of a career. Mr. Fagari passed
his with something bordering on the j
sensational.
STUDENT STUMPS HIM
The young instructor, walked into !
the classroom, his knees shaking \
just a little, and laid his impressive, j
black briefcase on the lecture stand
with a flourish calculated to reveal
long experience. Eut a student in i
the first row sized up the situation I
with hoxrible insight.
"Pretty proud of it, aren't you,;
Professor," he drawled, pointing to j
the briefcase.
His professorial dignity bespoiled, j
but with aplomb unruffled, the j
young instructor did the only thing j
left to do. He laughed out loud. The '
class followed his example and the |
ice was shattered.
WOWS EM SINCE
He's been wowing 'em ever since,
if a colloquialism may be permitted
on .so academic an issue.
But it must not be presumed that
Professor Fagan's bon mots are his j
chief pastime. They are spontane- |
ous incidentals, undoubtedly arising |
from his real joy of living. His chief j
work is still economics.
In the field of taxation, primarily I
in the relationship between fiscal |
policy and the business cycle, he is
an important authority. He has pub- |
lished frequent papers in such as- :
tute periodicals as the "Journal of |
Political Economy" and the "Quar- j
terly Economic Journal." His papers j
may be fovind in the proceedings of,
important conventions of economic j
associations.
Popping energetically from one end of the lecture platform to the other,
hands gesturing feverishly, Professor Fagan creates Mexican laborers
making Panama hats.
"And this little Mexican laborer making Panama hats, and this little
Mexican laborer making Panama hats, and this little Mexican laborer
Panama hats . .

In no time a small army of little
Mexican lalx>rers is engaged in the
production of Panama hats. The
class understands that here is an ex
cellent illustration of the growth of
an industry, complete with such
data as decreasing and then increas
ing marginal costs. And the class also
understands economics a little better
thereby.
PRODUCES WIDGETS
Abruptly, his point across, the
agile professor strangles the busy
Mexicans with an ATUC curve and
tosses them of! the rostrum to make
way for the next number on the
program—the "widgets."
Widgets are easier to produce than
Mexican laborers—they require no
manual demonstration, so he just
announces them. Now a widget is
actually an arbitrary unit of pro
duction, but. it's much more fun to
call it a "widget."
In a trice a large factory has been
set to manufacturing widgets by the
carload. The class is shown what
happens when all these widgets hit
the market, under given conditions
of supply and demand, under condi
| tions of perfect and imperfect cotn
[ petition.
