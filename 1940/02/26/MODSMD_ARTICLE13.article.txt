### 
COPENHAGEN, Feb. 25 (UP).—
The Scandinavian nations today
formed a solid bloc to defend their
neutrality, keep out of either of
Europe's two wars and obtain com
pensation for war'losses.
The foreign ministers of Sweden, i
Norway and Denmark conferred for,
four and a half hours formulating a
I common policy to keep Scandinavia
out of war. A joint communique is
sued after the meeting declared that
the Scandinavian nations were vic
tims of warfare carried on in viola
lion of international law and told the I
world what they proposed to do
about it:.
The conference of ministers:
| Decided that in the future the
Scandinavian governments will
act ;is a unit, supporting each other}
in all negotiations with belligerents, I
and agreed they will object strongly
to violations of international law iti
the conduct of naval warfare, such
as Britain's invasion of Norwegian
territorial waters to rescue the Alt
mark's prisoners.
2 Demanded formally that the ricu- |
I tral rights of the Scandinavian I
I states, "victims of warfare carried |
I on in violation of international law,"
jbe respected by all belligerents.
| They further agreed they will de- j
j mand compensation for war losses
| sustained by the Scandinavian coun- |
| tries—the United Press was in-'
j formed reliably, on this latter point
I although the communique avoided;
j mention of it.
!'» Decided the Scandinavian bloc i
j' will insist to belligerents that!
j the maintenance of Scandinavian !
j shipping, which has suffered heavy
I losses in the wai. is necessary for
j legitimate Scandinavian trade and
I simultaneously will protest the loss j
! of Scandinavian lives and ships caus
jcd by naval warfare. At the same |
I time they said the Scandinavian na
| l ions would "gladly welcome any j
j endeavor to initiate negotiations be
! tween the belligerents with a view
! to a just and permanent peace."
The Scandinavian nations will put
i pressure on all belligerents to re
| spect their neutral rights in con
, formity with international law, the
J communique said.
The foreign ministers unanimous- '
ly expressed the desire that the]
I Russo-Finnish war should be set
tled quickly by negotiation, with i
j Finland maintaining her independ- I
ence.
