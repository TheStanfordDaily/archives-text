# Comic Play Starts Run Tonight, 8:15
## 'George, Margaret' Combines Zany Plot, Screwy Characters 
### MARY JUDSON 
Nonsensical sense, screwball
characters, and rib-tickling lines
await Stanford audiences tonight
when the "good luck play," "George:
and Margafet," opens in the Little
Theater at 8:15 o'clock, beginning a
five-night run.
Written by Gerald Savory, "George
and Margaret" might well be called
an English varsion of "You Can't
Take It With You," because it aL%<>
deals with the humors of an ec
centric family which let.s itself go.
The characters' complete unconcern
for "what people may think" is easily
explained by the author's claim that
most of the punch lines were in
spired by retorts to uppity people
that he thought of too late.
REOPENED IN LONDON
Coming to Stanford after a suc
cessful two-year run in London,
Gerald Savory's galloping comedy
has reopened in London as the first
play to open since the war closed
down the theaters. It isn't often
that the Farm can offer shows cur
rently running in the top theaters.
Described as a "screwy" play by
Director F. Cowles Strickland,
"George and Margaret" contains two
romantic plots. One tells the story
of Frankie, the cuckoo daughter who
is out to snag a husband by any
means and who finally does it by
the unusual expedient of following
parental advice.
The other love interest is sup
plied by Claude, the painfully pe
dantic son who falls in love wilh
the maid, the only sensible person
in the household.
BEER' WON'T TALK

the making of a nutty comedy in

who gives the funniest perform

who is hard put to it to keep up
with his excitable wife.

Onesti, with Dana Winters as Mal
colm, the father, and Mary Mc-
Clerkin as Frankie. Claude and

the making of a nutty comedy in
clude George and Margaret, the title
characters who make the play but
who never appear; Beer, the new
maid # who never says a word but
who gives the funniest perform
ance in the play; and the poor father
who is hard put to it to keep up
with his excitable wife.
Cast as Alice, the mother, is Sylvia
Onesti, with Dana Winters as Mal
colm, the father, and Mary Mc-
Clerkin as Frankie. Claude and
Dudley, the sons are played by Ash
er Wilson and Quentin Warren, with
Ted Marcuse as Roger, their friend.
Nancy Burkett. plays the part of
Gladys, the maid, and Barbara
Sweetland will be Beer, the new
maid.
Tickets are 50 cents and may be
purchased at the box office or re
served in advance by phoning P.A.
22041.
Nonsensical sense, screwball
characters, and rib-tickling lines
await Stanford audiences tonight
when the "good luck play," "George:
and Margafet," opens in the Little
Theater at 8:15 o'clock, beginning a
five-night run.
Written by Gerald Savory, "George
and Margaret" might well be called
an English varsion of "You Can't
Take It With You," because it aL%<>
deals with the humors of an ec
centric family which let.s itself go.
The characters' complete unconcern
for "what people may think" is easily
explained by the author's claim that
most of the punch lines were in
spired by retorts to uppity people
that he thought of too late.
REOPENED IN LONDON
Coming to Stanford after a suc
cessful two-year run in London,
Gerald Savory's galloping comedy
has reopened in London as the first
play to open since the war closed
down the theaters. It isn't often
that the Farm can offer shows cur
rently running in the top theaters.
Described as a "screwy" play by
Director F. Cowles Strickland,
"George and Margaret" contains two
romantic plots. One tells the story
of Frankie, the cuckoo daughter who
is out to snag a husband by any
means and who finally does it by
the unusual expedient of following
parental advice.
The other love interest is sup
plied by Claude, the painfully pe
dantic son who falls in love wilh
the maid, the only sensible person
in the household.
