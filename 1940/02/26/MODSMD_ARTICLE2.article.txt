# Farm Fund Appeal Sent To Alumni
## Student Canvassers To Carry Family Call To 800 Local Homes 
### 
The "Stanford Family Ca'l" hav
ing received student support on the
Campus during the past few weeks,
will be heard throughout the world
today as the Stanford Fund Bulletin
is mailed to 33,000 alumni.
Bob Moulton, chairman of the stu
dent committee, announced last night
that 70 canvassers had been enlisted
to carry the Family Call to Palo
Alto's 800 alumni homes. The re
mainder of the 160 callers will be an
nounced tomorrow.
SUPPLEMENT BULLETIN
These students will supplement the
work of the Fund Bulletin, which is
a four-page review of some notable
Stanford achievements during 1939.
The students will explain the place
which the Fund has in the con
tinuing of Stanford life.
Paul C. Edwards, '06, is chairman
of the appeal, inaugurated this year
to become annual. It is designed as
a "living endowment" to replace the
support which Stanford has received
in the past from the kind of private
fortune which no longer exists under
present income and inheritance taxes.
A Family Call dinner is being
planned for tomorrow night in the
Union. The 180 enlisted students will
attend as guests of the Stanford
Fund, and receive suggestions for
carrying out their assignment. They
will then adjourn to make their
rounds of alumni homes.
APPEAL TO SENIORS
Members of the senior class will
be asked for contributions to the
Stanford Fund early next quarter,
according to an announcement of
Stan Swafford, chairman of the Sen
ior Fund Committee.
In a statement supporting the
Fund, Piesident Wilbur said:
"Donors with special interests are
apt to support them, but unspecified
giving is vital to the growth and
advancement of the University.
"New fields of interest, the pro
tection of a developing staff, the
further exploration of good leads, all
depend upon funds that can be var
ied in their use as the needs arise."
