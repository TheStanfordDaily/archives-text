# Curie to Relate Radium History
## Lecturer Renowned As Biography Writer 
### 
As the biographer of her mother, ■
Eve Curie first won renown; as a
lecturer Mile. Curie again tells the j
story of the discovery of radium, j
Her lecture here next Monday eve- j
ning at 8:30 o'clock in Memorial
Hall is entitled "The Magic of Raj
dium." I
Two years ago, shortly after the j
death of the Nobel prize-winner, ,
American publishers persuaded Eve j
Curie to write the story of her moth- 1
er's life. "Madame Curie," translat- j
ed by Vincent Sheean, became a best
seller in this country.
PERSONAL BIOGRAPHY
The biography was a personalized j
one, picturing Madame Curie as a |
wife and mother, rather than de- |
scribing only her scientific achieve- !
ments. Madame Curie, the discov
erer of radium, was, of course, a
famous figure, but of her personal
life little was known before the ap- i
pea ranee of this book.
Mile. Curie has followed the sue- !
cess of her book by equally popular
lecture tours. This season's series is
her second in the United States. She
plans to be in this country two
months.
TO WRITE NEW BOOK
When she can spare time from her
lectures and her work in the
French Commisariat of Informa
tion, Mile. Curie plans to write an
other book—this one on the lives of
other women scientists who have
contributed to the advancement of
civilization.
Tickets for next week's lecture
are on sale at the A.S.S.U. office, at
50 cents for students and 75 cents
for the general public. The A.S.S.U.
is sponsoring the event.
