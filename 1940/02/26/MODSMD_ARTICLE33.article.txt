### 
LOS ANGELES, Feb. 25 (UP). â€”
Defense counsel said today Dr.
| George K. Dazey, middle-aged so
| ciety physician, will take the wit
j ness stand tomorrow to deny the
; charge that he murdered his beau- I
I tilul actress wife, Doris, by chok- i
j ing her lungs with carbon monoxide |
j gas to simulate suicide.
| Dr. Dazey's alibi is that he was
j busy either in his office or at a
Santa Monica hospital throughout
: the afternoon and early evening
| when Mrs. Dazey was found dead in
I the family garage. Her death was j
| listed as a suicide until relatives
| opened a new investigation.
The defense contends Dr. Dazey
j was shocked to find his wife dead,
I rather than driven into a murder-
I ous rage because he suspected some
i one else was the father of his wife's
; child, four-year-old Walter Dazey. I
