# Kmetovic Stars as Ruggers Whip University Club, 8-3
## 45-yard Run Breaks Tie; Card B's Beat Club Seconds, 14-0 
### 
Pete Kmetovic grabbed (he glory
Saturday afternoon when he sprinted
45 yards for the winning try against
the University Club rugby team
with less than three minutes to play
in the second half.
The score was deadlocked at 3-3
when Kmet took matters into his
own hands, received the bail from
Jedenoff, and swivelled and smashed
his way down the middle of the field
through practically the whole U.
Club team. Austin converted, and
there was the ball game; Stanford 8,
University Club 3.
The Cardinals, tired after Thurs
day's battle with the Olympic Club,
had trouble throughout most of the
game. The club took the lead early
in Ihe first half when rugged little
Louie Casciani bounced over for a
fry following a 10-yard passing rush.
Bill Paulinan failed to convert, but
the 3-0 lead looked plenty big until
Aubrey Austin tied it up with a
beautiful 35-yard penalty kick after
10 minutes of the second half had
elapsed.
The Cardinal coaching staff was
pleased with the kicking to touch
of Fullback Frankie Albert, but be
moaned the fact that the wet ball
and muddy field hampered the work
of the Indian backs.
In the second game the Stanford
B's frounced the University Club
seconds, 14-0.
