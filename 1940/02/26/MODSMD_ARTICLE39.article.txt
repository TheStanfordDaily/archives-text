# Frosh Win Two Hoop Contests
## Lee's Men Favored To Take Cal Clashes 
### 
I With two sparkling triumphs over
! Modesto J.C. and Lowell High hist
j week-end, Coach H. B. Lee's frosh
i basketballers will prepare for the
j final series of the season this week-
I end against California's freshmen.
| Friday night the Papoose squad
; journeys to Berkeley to play the
! preliminary to the varsity-Cal clash.
Saturday the same clubs play in
the Pavilion here to close the season.
Modesto's quintet, fresh from a
45-38 trouncing of Cal'.s Cnbs, went
1 down to defeat, 47-30, last Friday
j against the finest performance the
j Card yearlings have shown this year.
1 The Modesto five battled on even
j terms with the frosh until midway
I in the second half.
MCCAFFREY SCORES TWICE
With the count then only 24-23
j for the Papooses, big Lee McCaffrey
( hit two beautiful hook shots and Ed
! Voss and Jack Dana followed up
with fast buckets to put the frosh out
, in front 32-23. From then on in,
j Dana and Voss scored almost at will
and Modesto never threatened.
The Lowell tilt was a 44-21 push
over. Dana, Voss, and Freddie Li- j
nari put the frosh off to an insur- '
! mountable lead right from the start, i
; and Lee yanked his first stringers at
half-time with the tally 30-8. The
! second and third teams played' on
\ even terms with the city club the
! second half.
FAVORED TO BEAT CAL
Since Lowell lost to the Cal Cubs
only 31-21, the two games, with
S Stanford's 35-34 win over the Cubs ;
| two weeks ago, serve to make Lee's |
I men favorites this week-end. The !
! closeness of the first Cal-Stanford '
j frosh tilt, however, and the tradi- 1
Itional rivalry make any predictions I
' extremely hazardous.
Big Ed Voss hit his best stride this '
year, counting 14 and 12 points and i
handling his pivot duties and defen
sive work beautifully. Dallmar, out
standing city high school center for
Lowell, w:is held without a field goal
by Voss and Ed Stamm, after count
ing 16 of his team's 21 points against
i Cal two weeks previously.

I With two sparkling triumphs over
! Modesto J.C. and Lowell High hist
j week-end, Coach H. B. Lee's frosh
i basketballers will prepare for the
j final series of the season this week-
I end against California's freshmen.
| Friday night the Papoose squad
; journeys to Berkeley to play the
! preliminary to the varsity-Cal clash.
Saturday the same clubs play in
the Pavilion here to close the season.
Modesto's quintet, fresh from a
45-38 trouncing of Cal'.s Cnbs, went
1 down to defeat, 47-30, last Friday
j against the finest performance the
j Card yearlings have shown this year.
1 The Modesto five battled on even
j terms with the frosh until midway
I in the second half.
MCCAFFREY SCORES TWICE
With the count then only 24-23
j for the Papooses, big Lee McCaffrey
( hit two beautiful hook shots and Ed
! Voss and Jack Dana followed up
with fast buckets to put the frosh out
, in front 32-23. From then on in,
j Dana and Voss scored almost at will
and Modesto never threatened.
The Lowell tilt was a 44-21 push
over. Dana, Voss, and Freddie Li- j
nari put the frosh off to an insur- '
! mountable lead right from the start, i
; and Lee yanked his first stringers at
half-time with the tally 30-8. The
! second and third teams played' on
\ even terms with the city club the
! second half.
FAVORED TO BEAT CAL
Since Lowell lost to the Cal Cubs
only 31-21, the two games, with
S Stanford's 35-34 win over the Cubs ;
| two weeks ago, serve to make Lee's |
I men favorites this week-end. The !
! closeness of the first Cal-Stanford '
j frosh tilt, however, and the tradi- 1
Itional rivalry make any predictions I
' extremely hazardous.
Big Ed Voss hit his best stride this '
year, counting 14 and 12 points and i
handling his pivot duties and defen
sive work beautifully. Dallmar, out
standing city high school center for
Lowell, w:is held without a field goal
by Voss and Ed Stamm, after count
ing 16 of his team's 21 points against
i Cal two weeks previously.
