# Three-mile Run Highlights Meet
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Feb. 25 (UP).—After
nearly a decade of glorifying the
| mile run, the United States now may
j enter upon a "distance era" because
!of a significant and stimulating
three-mile performance last night in
the National A.A.U. campionships.
Fifteen thousand track and field
enthusiasts at Madison Square Gar
! den roared their delight when J.
i Gregory Rice, the half-pint board
blazer from South Bend, Ind., hung
up a new indoor world record of 13
minutes 55.9 seconds in winning the
three-mile event, a reaction in sharp
contrast to their virtual apathy when
Chuck Fenske won his sixth straight
mile in the smart time of 4:08.8,
eclipsing by far the only mile ever
j run in the Internationals before—
| Gene Venzke's 4:15 of 8 years ago.
Track experts believe that the
l Rice run last night, smashing Fin
| nish Willie Ritola's 15-year mark of
j 13:56.2, may launch American run
j ners upon u campaign for distance
I records.
