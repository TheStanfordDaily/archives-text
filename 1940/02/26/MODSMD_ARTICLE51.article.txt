# Potential Suicide

### 
PERHAPS Monday morning is a bad time to
bring up the subject of careless or irrespon
sible driving, but a warning about the grue
some aspects of night and pleasure-time might
not be entirely unnoticed. The equally grue
some after-effects of a double holiday usually
leave a man far more sober than when the big
party or series of parties began.
Chief Raymond Cato of the California High
way Patrol has proved that a good many of the
state's drivers are involved in mishaps when
the drivers were under the influence of liquor.
One county reported over 50 per cent of its
crashes as due to alcoholism. In all such cases
the accidents occurred during darknessâ€”the
hours between 6 p.m. and 4 a.m.
But you might ask, "Why the sudden Puri
tanical stand? College boys and girls are going
to drink, and no one is going to stop us."
That, too, is very true. The Administration
has never raided any bar (and probably never
will), but they have thrown men out of the
University who became involved in scrapes
where alcohol had a hand. Once again it's the
after-effects that tear a man down. Luckily
enough, none of the present school year's mis
haps resulted in expulsion, nor did any of the
highway patrol reports show any indication of
drunkenness.
All the student wrecks, however, have been
after dark. Drowsiness has been proven to be
responsible for two of them. Four cars were
total wrecks, one senior is dead, a junior's shoes
liad to be ripped off before they could remove
jiis horribly mangled, unconscious body from
the wreckage. Another junior, a passenger,
narrowly missed having his head severed when
his Death Wagon telescoped against the rear
of a ten-ton semi-trailer. Last year two very
prominent freshmen were killed at night just
off the campus. A campus cop commented that
they "were just a mess of mashed potatoes"
when he started to assemble the debris.
Two men and one woman I knew as freshmen
are dead. Another classmate is hovering be
tween them and life at this very moment,
Kinda makes you think, doesn't it?
