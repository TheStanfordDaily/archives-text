# The 						Turning Point?
## 
### 
AFTER winning a wholehearted "okay" from
the campus for its first show of this quar
ter, "Warrior's Husband," the Division of Speech
and Drama will venture forth tonight about 8.15
with another production.
Having picked up a fair number of converts
on its initial and successful attempt, the Division
is in the uneasy spot of staging a repetition of
its earlier triumph. If it should fail, the letdown
would damage the Division's prestige. And if
Jonight's show should ring the bell again, the
Division's future Farm patronage will be hap
pily on more solid ground.
Like "Warrior's Husband," tonight's show is
designed to make us laugh. In London, after
a successful run of two years, "George and
Margaret" reopened the other day—the first
new legitimate play since blackouts swept
through the English theater last autumn.
With a plant such as Memorial Hall, and with
outstanding men such as Hubert Heffner, F.
Cowles Strickland, and Waldemar Johansen,
the "golden age of Stanford drama" may be
just around the corner. It should be—after a
long and somewhat spotty career. Every play
is a hurdle, and tonight's final curtain may dis
pose of another one.
A tense, war-scared London is laughing at the
screwball humor of "George and Margaret."
Maybe Stanford will find a chuckle or two
there, too.—D. H.
