f PHK EDITOR. SIR:
What is there about a superior intellect that
makes it disagree with anything 't'he people" like?
How individualistic one must feel who opposes, with
out one word of praise, the approval of the country!
Of course, I suppose, it's even more to the credit of
said "friend"' that he could criticize the "sentimental
ity of the author" when he (admittedly if rumor is
right) has never bothered to read the book. And as
for types, I wonder if this "friend" can cite many
characters as totally selfish as Scarlett, whom he
classifies with indifferent ease. It seems to me she is

at least a slight deviation from type—and that
inost characters are little more than that.
Clever defiance is hard to dispute, but I might
point out that historical accuracy in "Gone With the
Wind" is not usually offered as "its excuse for being"
but rather as part of the triumph. If the actualities
of the seige of Atlanta are too trite for print, what
would "Bull Session want" Miss Mitchell to do—apol
ogize for the reality of historical drama?
There is also the thought that perhaps this "friend"
is not very familiar with Atlanta or Southern people.
Neither am I, but Miss Mitchell is. This is obviously
only my opinion; of course, the critic knew there
would be disagreement, but 1 ask him not to view this
too scornfully, thinking, "Yes, 1 would be misunder
stood. There had to be objections when 1 panned that.
Nobody would agree with my strange—well, intelli
gent ideas." And finally I might add—why spoil an
extremely clever citicism with a saying that is un
believably trite—"that's life you know"—immediately
following a condemnation of Scarlett's own skillfully
expressed attitude (philosophy as this critic says).
You are such a scholar, too!
