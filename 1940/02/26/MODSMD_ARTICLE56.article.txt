THE IDEAL WIFE
r | I IIE optimism of many members of the California
student body is an appauling study. According to
the San Francisco Examiner, a few Cal men have al
ready figured out exactly what their wives are going
to be like. With many a Berkeley banality, Vie Bottari
and Jim Dieterich describe "the ideal wife."
Here is a frank, straight-from-the-shoulder re
mark by Cal's ail-American halfback: "I like a girl
to be my equal in intelligence. I don't like the 'dumb'
type." After this modest beginning Bottari runs on
to a revolutionary, unequivocal stand on sophistica
tion. "Sophistication is nice in a girl when the occa
sion calls for it," he declares, sinking his teeth into a
really vital problem.
I wonder who called signals in the Cal backfield.
Not to be outdone by his muscular fellow student,
Jim Dieterich comes through with a few snappy re
marks of his own. "As I am only five feet five," he
confides, "I dislike girls who wear high heels." The
euthenics move has nothing to fear when vital young
men arc probing so deeply into the problems of mar
riage.

|>UT the Cal men are not alone in their analysis of
marital futures. Patty Pruyn, candidate for queen
of the Big "C" Circus, lists her standards of the ideal
husband: "He should be good-natured, loyal, and a
conservative, dresser." Well, that excludes flashy race
track sports anyway.
And Margaret Appenzeller enlarges upon the fash
ion requirements for her dream man: "I hate sloppy
dressers," she warns, "and boys who wear sweaters
without shirts."
A mildly curious observer might wonder just who
governs romance at Berkeley—Dan Cupid or Phelps-
Terkel?
For years those who worry about the future of the
race have pleaded for the use of intelligence in selec
tion of mates. Nature has not given us the proper
insurance against unhappy marriages and poor speci
mens of humanity for offspring, they say. Man must
think his way into propagation.
If the Cal opinions represent man's eiTort to use
intelligence in the selection of mates, nature may not
have done such a bad job after all. A good basic
urge would certainly be preferable to looking around
for a girl who doesn't wear high heels.
But actually these marital prophets who describe
their mates-to-be in the shade of the old Campanile
are probably hiding the real facts under a newsy mist
of clothes-propaganda. In spite of deceiving appear
ances, those California commenters on connubial bliss
are probably very normal people.
I'm just wondering if Vic Bottari can find his "equal
in intelligence." It will be a tough job, Vic. But give
it a try. Look around.
