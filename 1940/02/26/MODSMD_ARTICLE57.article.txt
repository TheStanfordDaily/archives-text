### DOUC JAQUES 
G.W.T.W.
Three Farm girls (women) went down to San Jose
(village) last Thursday night (vacation) to see Gone
With the Wind (prelude to The Grapes of Wrath).
They went to a place after the show, getting there
a little after 12 o'clock, and one of them called Grey
hound. "When does the next bus leave?"
"At 5:25, madamc."
It was with infinitely less self-confidence that she
called the Southern Pacific and asked the same ques
tion.
"Four o'clock, madame."
Here these three girls were, looking lockouts right
in the face, 20 miles down the peninsula in San Jose,
of all places.
Now what could they do? Call a cab, as you would?
Not these girls, cagcy as they arc.
They went to all the bars within walking distance
until they found some Stanford guys, who generously
gave them a ride back to school in their turtle-back.

LIFE WITH FATHER
A Stanford couple up in a third-rate night club
in the City Saturday night were jostled by an elderly
pair who were hoofing it around the small dance floor
like mad.
The old man turned to the Stanford couple as they
danced casually by, and said, "Jazz it up! Jazz it up!
You're dead on your feet," and breezed on by.

ANYTHING GOES
At night on the Theta sleeping porch a girl in a
top bunk sat straight up, not waking up. but sitting
up, and said, "There are three other girls on the com
mittee, but I'm the most important."
And that same night, with the memory of what?
running across her mind, another girl on the same
porch cried repeatedly, "No, no, no."

Three Farm girls (women) went down to San Jose
(village) last Thursday night (vacation) to see Gone
With the Wind (prelude to The Grapes of Wrath).
They went to a place after the show, getting there
a little after 12 o'clock, and one of them called Grey
hound. "When does the next bus leave?"
"At 5:25, madamc."
It was with infinitely less self-confidence that she
called the Southern Pacific and asked the same ques
tion.
"Four o'clock, madame."
Here these three girls were, looking lockouts right
in the face, 20 miles down the peninsula in San Jose,
of all places.
Now what could they do? Call a cab, as you would?
Not these girls, cagcy as they arc.
They went to all the bars within walking distance
until they found some Stanford guys, who generously
gave them a ride back to school in their turtle-back.

LIFE WITH FATHER
A Stanford couple up in a third-rate night club
in the City Saturday night were jostled by an elderly
pair who were hoofing it around the small dance floor
like mad.
The old man turned to the Stanford couple as they
danced casually by, and said, "Jazz it up! Jazz it up!
You're dead on your feet," and breezed on by.

ANYTHING GOES
At night on the Theta sleeping porch a girl in a
top bunk sat straight up, not waking up. but sitting
up, and said, "There are three other girls on the com
mittee, but I'm the most important."
And that same night, with the memory of what?
running across her mind, another girl on the same
porch cried repeatedly, "No, no, no."
