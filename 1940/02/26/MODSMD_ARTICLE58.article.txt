# Astaire Show Illustrates Diminishing Utility Theory
## 
### 
"BROADWAY IMELODY OF 1040," now playing at the Stanford.
Some people think that if one of sonk'thing is good, two of it should
he twice as good, and so on lip into infinity. That's the rule which was
used in Broadway Melody of 1 !»40, hut any Econ I student could dis
prove the above premise with just the hare rudiments of the theory of

marginal utility.
! Fred Astaire was good in inti
mate musical comedies; so he should
be better in a tremendous musical
spectacle. Fred Astaire is one of
the best dancers in the country; so
he'd probably be three times as good
if he had Eleanor Powell, also one
of the best dancers in the country,
and George Murphy, no slouch, as
I his partners.
NEEDS AMUSING PLOT
But they forgot a couple of things.
I Astaire's brand of witty comedy and
brilliant dancing need a light
weight, amusing plot, to give them
some reason for being. Miss Pow
ell's dancing is superb, but she can
not crack out a comedy line with
Ginger Rogers' dead-pan finesse
| even il she has the lines, which she
hadn't. And George Murphy has a
pleasing enough personality to merit
more than the part of a heel, even
if he is regenerated at the finale.
The dancing in the show couldn't
be better, especially the fencing
routine done by Astaire and Mur
phy, and the tap rhumba done by
Miss Powell and Astaire to Cole
Porter's unforgettable "Begin the
Beguine."
UNINSPIRED PLOT
These make the show worth see
ing—worth seeing, that is, if you
can stand a completely uninspired
back-stage plot concerned with two
struggling hoofers, one of whom gets
the part the other one should have
had, and then gets swell-headed.
There's the last-minute switch in
parts because the leading man is
drunk, and nearly every other
cliche we've been seeing in one form
or another since "Golddiggers of
Broadway."
Dances are staged on sets that
would make Rockefeller Center bow
politely and say, "After you," and
there are thousands of luscious
chorines, but luckily the mob re
tires when Astaire and Powell start
to dance. Still the cast deserves bet
ter. —Nowell

Some people think that if one of sonk'thing is good, two of it should
he twice as good, and so on lip into infinity. That's the rule which was
used in Broadway Melody of 1 !»40, hut any Econ I student could dis
prove the above premise with just the hare rudiments of the theory of

marginal utility.
! Fred Astaire was good in inti
mate musical comedies; so he should
be better in a tremendous musical
spectacle. Fred Astaire is one of
the best dancers in the country; so
he'd probably be three times as good
if he had Eleanor Powell, also one
of the best dancers in the country,
and George Murphy, no slouch, as
I his partners.
NEEDS AMUSING PLOT
But they forgot a couple of things.
I Astaire's brand of witty comedy and
brilliant dancing need a light
weight, amusing plot, to give them
some reason for being. Miss Pow
ell's dancing is superb, but she can
not crack out a comedy line with
Ginger Rogers' dead-pan finesse
| even il she has the lines, which she
hadn't. And George Murphy has a
pleasing enough personality to merit
more than the part of a heel, even
if he is regenerated at the finale.
The dancing in the show couldn't
be better, especially the fencing
routine done by Astaire and Mur
phy, and the tap rhumba done by
Miss Powell and Astaire to Cole
Porter's unforgettable "Begin the
Beguine."
UNINSPIRED PLOT
These make the show worth see
ing—worth seeing, that is, if you
can stand a completely uninspired
back-stage plot concerned with two
struggling hoofers, one of whom gets
the part the other one should have
had, and then gets swell-headed.
There's the last-minute switch in
parts because the leading man is
drunk, and nearly every other
cliche we've been seeing in one form
or another since "Golddiggers of
Broadway."
Dances are staged on sets that
would make Rockefeller Center bow
politely and say, "After you," and
there are thousands of luscious
chorines, but luckily the mob re
tires when Astaire and Powell start
to dance. Still the cast deserves bet
ter. —Nowell
