# Varsity Nips Cocky S.C. Quint 46-45
## Penn Sinks Deciding Goal from Mid-floor During Final Seconds 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Showing their old drive, speed, and
deception, Stanford's basketball team
became the best in the country for
one night when they nipped a cocky
U.S.C. quintet at its best, 46-45, in
last Friday's thriller.
The brand of basketball by both
teams on Saturday was far below
that of the previous night as the
Trojan powerhouse rolled to a 39-
32 victory over a tired Card five
that just couldn't hit when the
pressure was on.
DEAN PLEASED
"I was certainly proud of the per
formance of every boy on Friday
night," said Coach Everett Dean
yesterday. "The drive and deter
mination the team showed on Sat
urday gives them nothing to be
ashamed of."
It would have been a crime if the
Indians had lost on Friday, which
they came so close to doing. After
out-finessing, out-fighting, and out
shooting El Trojan for 39 minutes of
the game, the Cards stood dumb
foundedly to watch their carefully
built 5-point lead vanish into a
1-point deficiency on three soaring,
story book field goals by those re
markable Trojans, Jack Lippert and
Ralph Vaughn.
PENN THE HERO
But it couldn't happen here! The
desperate Cards hustled the ball
down court to Bob Penn, who earned
himself a heio's title by lofting
through a 35-foot field goal just be
fore the gun. It was A beautiful
come - through performance and
sewed up one of the most thrilling
games the Pavilion has ever seen.
There were lots of things that
contributed to Friday's win. As was
predicted, Fordy Anderson made a
whale of a difference in the Card
team. In fact, Fordy made 15 points
difference as he flashed through the
Troy defense or stole the ball for
set-up after set-up.
VAUGHN HANDCUFFED
Co-Captain Ken Davidson, who
played himself into unconsciousness
at gun-time, handcuffed a sizzling
hot Vaughn for a minimum of shots
at the basket as well as contributing
11 points to Stanford's total. Big
Bill Cowden, voted the only "body
boy" on the team, fought off those
Trojans time and time again on the
defensive backboard.
On Saturday Dean kept the line
up as fresh as possible, using Tiff
Denton, Bob Penn, Leon Lafaille,
and Bob Wensel to spell the first
stringers; but still the inevitable
happened. The talented Trojans em
ployed mainly their individual bril
liance rather than any team work to
turn back the Cards.
The order in the conference again
remained unchanged after a week
end of play, for with U.C.L.A. beat
ing California once, each team won
and lost one game.

they came so close to doing. After
out-finessing, out-fighting, and out
shooting El Trojan for 39 minutes of
the game, the Cards stood dumb
foundedly to watch their carefully
built 5-point lead vanish into a
1-point deficiency on three soaring,
story book field goals by those re
markable Trojans, Jack Lippert and
Ralph Vaughn.
PENN THE HERO
But it couldn't happen here! The
desperate Cards hustled the ball
down court to Bob Penn, who earned
himself a heio's title by lofting
through a 35-foot field goal just be
fore the gun. It was A beautiful
come - through performance and
sewed up one of the most thrilling
games the Pavilion has ever seen.
There were lots of things that
contributed to Friday's win. As was
predicted, Fordy Anderson made a
whale of a difference in the Card
team. In fact, Fordy made 15 points
difference as he flashed through the
Troy defense or stole the ball for
set-up after set-up.
VAUGHN HANDCUFFED
Co-Captain Ken Davidson, who
played himself into unconsciousness
at gun-time, handcuffed a sizzling
hot Vaughn for a minimum of shots
at the basket as well as contributing
11 points to Stanford's total. Big
Bill Cowden, voted the only "body
boy" on the team, fought off those
Trojans time and time again on the
defensive backboard.
On Saturday Dean kept the line
up as fresh as possible, using Tiff
Denton, Bob Penn, Leon Lafaille,
and Bob Wensel to spell the first
stringers; but still the inevitable
happened. The talented Trojans em
ployed mainly their individual bril
liance rather than any team work to
turn back the Cards.
The order in the conference again
remained unchanged after a week
end of play, for with U.C.L.A. beat
ing California once, each team won
and lost one game.
Showing their old drive, speed, and
deception, Stanford's basketball team
became the best in the country for
one night when they nipped a cocky
U.S.C. quintet at its best, 46-45, in
last Friday's thriller.
The brand of basketball by both
teams on Saturday was far below
that of the previous night as the
Trojan powerhouse rolled to a 39-
32 victory over a tired Card five
that just couldn't hit when the
pressure was on.
DEAN PLEASED
"I was certainly proud of the per
formance of every boy on Friday
night," said Coach Everett Dean
yesterday. "The drive and deter
mination the team showed on Sat
urday gives them nothing to be
ashamed of."
It would have been a crime if the
Indians had lost on Friday, which
they came so close to doing. After
out-finessing, out-fighting, and out
shooting El Trojan for 39 minutes of
the game, the Cards stood dumb
