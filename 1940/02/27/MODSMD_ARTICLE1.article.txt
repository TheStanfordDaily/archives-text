### WILSON CANNON 
is an interesting story mak
ing the rounds among the little
people of Germany. They say that
Hitler is not so sure he wants Italy
on the side of the, Nazis . . . be
cause he would need only one divi
sion of soldiers to keep the Italians
under his first, but would have to
waste 20 divisions to rescue Musso
lini from the French.
But Der Fuehrer is a wise states
man. If he ever voiced any such
opinion of Italy's power he would
be sure to do so in a very subtle
whisper. For neutral Italy, vast
enigma of the present war, straddles
the lifelines of Europe like a giant
spaghetti-legged octopus.
And with Mussolini straining
every effort to prevent each new
war incident from involving Italy
in the early stages of World War 11,
this Juliet of nations finds itself in
the not-too-unpleasant situation
of being wooed by three Romeos
—Germany, France, and Britain.
Both sides in the European con
flict need Italy's aid, both sides are
even more aware that Italy could
easily prove a dangerous enemy . . .
largely through her strategic posi
tion on the map of present-day Eu
rope. And neither side is com
fortably sure whether Mussolini is
speeding the construction of fortifi
cations around her Alpine border
and adding daily to her fleet of over
2,000 war planes in order to be a
powerful ally for one side ... or
strong enough not to have to fight
against either.

/ 1 ERMANY, which would be able
to send its armed might through
the Brenner Pass and around
France's Maginot Line — if Italy
picks the swastika bouquet instead
of the French Jily—took great joy
in an Italian "hypothetical victory"
iii a sham battle against the French
at the eve of the war.
But Germany has more than an
Italian "hypothetical victory" to show
her that the Nazis need a military
wedding along the Rome-Berlin
axis. They need no prophet to show
them the dark shadow of II Duce's
might lengthening along the Medi
terranean.
For Italian air and sea bases in
(lie south and on the island of
Sardinia are giant scissors which
can clip France's munition lines
to Africa, and British communica
tions to India. And Mussolini's
submarines are based on Corsica
and Sardinia . . . ready to slip out
through Gibraltar to give John
Hull's merchant vessels a run for
their money on the Atlantic.
But Germany knows just as well
that the Italian boot can prove as
effective against the Nazi shin as it
could against John Bull. Fortifica
tions on the southeastern toe of
Mussolini-land give Italy an air
tight lock on the Adriatic . . . Ger
man lifeline through the Balkans to
minerals and Roumanian oil.

Iho Brenner Pass, possible
gateway to a Nazi invasion of
Franco, does not have (he same ap
peal to Nazi statesmen when they
discuss the possibilities of an Allied
army sweeping through en route to
Berlin.
Mussolini is acting the part of a
war-time Juliet . . . but he knows
well that Italy is vulnerable. If
she joins the Allies Germany could
storm through the Brenner pass.
Should she wed Germany, France
would seep past scattered defenses
over many Alpine passes. And
coal-less Italy treasures her Alpine
hydro-electric plants.
The military air fields which are
I lie pride of Italy's war ministry
would prove easy targets for
bombers which might easily force
her sky fleet to the ground ... a
la Poland. And her populous
southern citics would be crushed
by psychological air attacks that
might prove disastrous.
Italy gets six-sevenths of her im
ports by water. Should Britain send
her bulldogs to Gibraltar and Suez
she could starve her for oil, cotton,
coal, and foodstuffs . . . and Italy
needs these imports to survive.
