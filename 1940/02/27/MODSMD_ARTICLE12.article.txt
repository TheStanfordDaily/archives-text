# Farm Players Chalk Up Hit With 'George and Margaret'

They did it again.
Last night the Stanford Players turned out another comedy hit, when
their production of "George and Margaret" opened a five-night run in the
Little Theater of Memorial Hall.
It was a light-weight little play completely lacking in any profundity

►or social significance, but. it did what
it was meant to do, i.e., it got the
laughs. A competent cast held out
Savory's witty lines in both hands
and the audience literally sat for
ward in their scats and reached for
them.
Parts of the production were
ragged and the cast, used to the
vast reachcs of the big theater,
showed an almost unanimous tend
ency toward over-projection; but a
general good time was enjoyed by
all despite these objections, and
probably these things will be im
proved in the rest of the perform
ances.
Dana Winters, in a make-up which
made him look surprisingly like
Rudyard Kipling in later life, gave
what, was unquestionably the best
performance.
As the mild, somewhat bewildered
father, who still managed to keep
pretty close tabs on the affairs of
his family, be consistently kept his
voice within the intimate limits of
the theater, and still managed to put
over his lines with a subtle timing
and placement which added much to
the charm of the character.
In one of those classic silly female
