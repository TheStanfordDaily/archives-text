# Farm Players Chalk Up Hit With 'George and Margaret'
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
They did it again.
Last night the Stanford Players turned out another comedy hit, when
their production of "George and Margaret" opened a five-night run in the
Little Theater of Memorial Hall.
It was a light-weight little play completely lacking in any profundity

â–ºor social significance, but. it did what
it was meant to do, i.e., it got the
laughs. A competent cast held out
Savory's witty lines in both hands
and the audience literally sat for
ward in their scats and reached for
them.
Parts of the production were
ragged and the cast, used to the
vast reachcs of the big theater,
showed an almost unanimous tend
ency toward over-projection; but a
general good time was enjoyed by
all despite these objections, and
probably these things will be im
proved in the rest of the perform
ances.
Dana Winters, in a make-up which
made him look surprisingly like
Rudyard Kipling in later life, gave
what, was unquestionably the best
performance.
As the mild, somewhat bewildered
father, who still managed to keep
pretty close tabs on the affairs of
his family, be consistently kept his
voice within the intimate limits of
the theater, and still managed to put
over his lines with a subtle timing
and placement which added much to
the charm of the character.
In one of those classic silly female
j parts, so dear to the English play- j
I wright's pen, Sylvia Onesti was i
! nearly on a par with Winters, though \
I certain of the vocal mannerisms, no j
j doubt necessary to the part, began
; to pall along toward the end of the
third act. This, however, is a minor
j criticism ol what was a perform- |
ance of the high caliber audiences j
i have come to expect from this ex-
I eel lent comedienne.
WILSON C ARICATURES
Almost a caricature of a carica- j
Ituie was Ash Wilson's rendition of a|
: completely dull man, and he, too,'
j got his laughs with ease and dis- 1
j patch. However, the over-projection j
j quibble can be made in his case.
The play itsell is tHo story of a
j few weeks in the life of one of!
i those screwy families who must be
j delightful, if rather trying to know.,
| Savory uses line rather than situa
tions for his effects, and some of I
those lines are the sort the Stan
ford rough glories in. Not exactly j
earthy, but more, perhaps, upper
class risqueness, slightly on the |
dirty side. Winters' oil can with its !
| attendant implications is only one. j
CONTRAST PART
Ted Marcuse handled his part j
' with a sort of tongue-in-cheek so- !
! phistication. which contrasted nicely |
j with the family's frantic goings, and j
I which also served to point up his j
I sudden reversion to their own j
I brand of hysteria.
Mary McClerkin, Nancy Burkett,
1 and Quentin Warren lacked the rest
iof the cast's polish, probably be- i
j cause none of them has had as much j
experience. However, they were ;
each more than adequate.
Beer, the silent maid, played by
j Barbara Sweetland, suffered from
| too much build-up from the rest of
j the cast, with the result that the play j
I ended in almost un-understandable i
! confusion. But it didn't really rnat
j ter. It was a swell show.
Repeat performances will be giv- j
I en tomorrow, Thursday, Friday, and I
1 Saturday nights.
