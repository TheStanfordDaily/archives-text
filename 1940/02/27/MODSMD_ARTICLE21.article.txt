# Stanford's [Nut Farm Raises Hybrid Variety of Chaparral
## 
### JAN GOULD 
"The hell wilh Chaparral!" ,
And immediately the upstairs
window flies open, and the tSanford
Chaparral — represented by Marco
Thorne, as editor, or by the 75 staff
members as indispensable executives
—asks some hcckling Daily man
what, please, is the matter?
THORNE TELLS ALL
Marco Thorne, baby and adult i
killer, teetered around in his swivel
chair fhe other afternoon and started
to tell about the magazine which he I
says is not "his" but the "kids',",
thusly:
"Hurt, will you stop racing your
motor?" he said aside to his com- j
plaining associate editor . . .
"Chappie, because of its printing :
arrangement . . . Wait a minute."
"Stan . . . Hey, SWAFF. how
about those scissors?" And he got
up to go and interview Stan Swaf- j
ford, busness manager, about whe- 1
ther the aforementioned Marco could ,
have a pair of scissors, if he im- j
proved his attitude.
"I can't tell you what Chappie is
like without telling you about the !
printing process," he continued . . . ;
HUMOR IN ONE LESSON
"Through the University Press!
with Rod and gun!" shouted Bob j
Rieser, "do that, Marco! Look, here's;
; an idea of John Elliot's. A guy car
; ries a gal into the Chapel, all the 1
(other guys chasing him. Guy yells
| 'Sanctuary!' Get it?"
By this time the two Chaparral
I offices had filled up with what looked
! like all 24 staff artists.
! Thorne sat there in his chair,
watched Jane Armstrong. Anne
Dyer, and Lois Enrry—who. under
| the direction of Doris Tucker, were
; cleaning up the office or typing—
; Claire Burtchaell, editor in charge
! of the 100 exchange magazines, from
I which Chappie gets ga;;s and an oc
: easional cartoon. (Chappie has re
j ceived 30 requests Jrom other maga-
I /.ines for permission to reprint car
toons since January.)
"The artists are all bats," contin
ued Marco, "and the writers are just
the same. Ben Parkinson, who writes
those corny things about Ronald
Dare, comes up here and we have to
pry his stuff out of his hand. Then

we laugh, and set it. Wiggins is
good—quotes poetry all the time and
drives us nuts. Taylor over here's
been writing couplets about 'The
Editor Is Dead—To a Certain Ex
tent.' And at the same time the
whole staff has to sit around kibitz
ing whille you do this article.
"Did I tell you about the way we
publish Chappie? . . .
"Oh well, that's not Chappie. It's
right up here in this nut house. 1
figure it' the kids have a good time,
they'll make a good magazine. It's
really one happy family of 75 kids—
and I have to handle them. It's fun.
"Remember the Old Boy's motto?
"Tis better to have lived and laughed
than never to have lived at all.'
That's it.
"Will you kids stop racing your
motors?"

Marco Thorne, baby and adult i
killer, teetered around in his swivel
chair fhe other afternoon and started
to tell about the magazine which he I
says is not "his" but the "kids',",
thusly:
"Hurt, will you stop racing your
motor?" he said aside to his com- j
plaining associate editor . . .
"Chappie, because of its printing :
arrangement . . . Wait a minute."
"Stan . . . Hey, SWAFF. how
about those scissors?" And he got
up to go and interview Stan Swaf- j
ford, busness manager, about whe- 1
ther the aforementioned Marco could ,
have a pair of scissors, if he im- j
proved his attitude.
"I can't tell you what Chappie is
like without telling you about the !
printing process," he continued . . . ;

Rieser, "do that, Marco! Look, here's;
