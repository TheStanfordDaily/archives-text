STANFORD'S HORSEIIIDE . . .
Chasers opened their league sea- I
son on a gfloomy Saturday last ]
week-end by dropping a 2-1 heart- j
breaker to Santa Clara's touted |
Broncos. The defeat put the Cards j
in the cellar of the California Inter- 1
collegiate Baseball Association, but j
with the material on hand, it's not!
impossible that Harry Wolter's boys :
will wind up on top when the pen- !
nant scramble ends late in April.
Quentin Thompson, big right
handed hurler who considers the I
day lost when he allows more than j
half a dozen hits, is the Farm nine's
biggest asset. The backbone of a
well-balanced mound staff, Cootie
probably set some kind of a league
record last year for games lost by
one run. Unless someone cuts his
throwing arm off at the shoulder,
Thompson will be able to take his
pick of major league contracts when
he hangs up his Stanford uniform
for the last time in the spring of '41.
Claude Purkitt is another right
hander who can be counted on for
some winning efforts this spring.
"Purk" isn't as fast as Thompson,
but his control has improved
greatly since last season, and ho was
just lis effective as Coot in the prac
tice games. He'll probably start
against St. Mary's in Seals Stadium
tomorrow night.
A QUARTET . . .
Four good pitchers are on hand to ]
t:»ki; over if either of the starting j
moundsmen falters. Bill Masters has
been slow rounding into top form
this year, but off last season's rec
ords his effectiveness should im
prove. Sophomore Russ Smith is the
only portsider on the staff. Harry
Dyck, a newcomer to the squad,
worked well in the practice games.
Sid Hayes, who takes time out be
tween flights of hurdles to throw
strikes, has improved steadily since
hfe came out.
The receiving corps took it on the
chin when Captain Bill Jameson
was declared ineligible. Big Sid
Lewis, who took his place in the
line-up, is a good catcher and han
dles the moundsmen well, but can't
pick runners off the bases the way
Bill did. Jack Randall is a good
backstop, but his stickwork hasn't
been very impressive as yet. Herb
Atkinson is the most consistent hit
ter of the three candidates for the
job, but his lack of size is against
him.
FOUR JUNIOR COLLEGE . . .
Transfers have won places in the j
Card batting order, three of them
from San Mateo J. C. A trio of
regulars from last year's team round
out the opening roster.
The three former Bulldogs are
Alex Cereghino, Hal Costello, and
Frank Pfyl. Cereghino stepped into
the center field spot soon after the
practice season got under way. He's
the lead-off man in the batting or
der, and Saturday singled to drive
in the only Stanford run. "Cherry"
takes his cuts from the first base
side of the plate.
Frank Pfyl, twin brother of Monty
Pfyl, first-string short stop, won the
right field job from Jack Parsons
and Jim Verdieck. Hal Costello, an
other ex-San Matean, holds down the
initial sack and is the most danger
ous long distance hitter on the club.
Harry Parsons is a reliable second
sacker, and has a steadying influence
on volatile Monty Pfyl. Elton Boone
returned from last year's squad to
work at thircl base. Boone hits clean
up, although he hasn't shown the
power at the plate that he had last
season. Harry Wolter expects him
to start pounding the ball again soon.
"Old Reliable" Norm Juney, left
fielder, covers a lot of ground in the
gardens and is the most consistent
hitter on the club to date. Norm got
two for four in Santa Clara Sat
urday.
So the stuff is there for a good
ball club, and with the league as
evenly balanced as it is, the Cards
might wake up on top of the heap
some balmy day this spring.

for the last time in the spring of '41.
Claude Purkitt is another right
hander who can be counted on for
some winning efforts this spring.
"Purk" isn't as fast as Thompson,
but his control has improved
greatly since last season, and ho was
just lis effective as Coot in the prac
tice games. He'll probably start
against St. Mary's in Seals Stadium
tomorrow night.
A QUARTET . . .
Four good pitchers are on hand to ]
t:»ki; over if either of the starting j
moundsmen falters. Bill Masters has
been slow rounding into top form
this year, but off last season's rec
ords his effectiveness should im
prove. Sophomore Russ Smith is the
only portsider on the staff. Harry
Dyck, a newcomer to the squad,
worked well in the practice games.
Sid Hayes, who takes time out be
tween flights of hurdles to throw
strikes, has improved steadily since
hfe came out.
The receiving corps took it on the
chin when Captain Bill Jameson
was declared ineligible. Big Sid
Lewis, who took his place in the
line-up, is a good catcher and han
dles the moundsmen well, but can't
pick runners off the bases the way
Bill did. Jack Randall is a good
backstop, but his stickwork hasn't
been very impressive as yet. Herb
Atkinson is the most consistent hit
ter of the three candidates for the
job, but his lack of size is against
him.
FOUR JUNIOR COLLEGE . . .
Transfers have won places in the j
Card batting order, three of them
from San Mateo J. C. A trio of
regulars from last year's team round
out the opening roster.
The three former Bulldogs are
Alex Cereghino, Hal Costello, and
Frank Pfyl. Cereghino stepped into
the center field spot soon after the
practice season got under way. He's
the lead-off man in the batting or
der, and Saturday singled to drive
in the only Stanford run. "Cherry"
takes his cuts from the first base
side of the plate.
Frank Pfyl, twin brother of Monty
Pfyl, first-string short stop, won the
right field job from Jack Parsons
and Jim Verdieck. Hal Costello, an
other ex-San Matean, holds down the
initial sack and is the most danger
ous long distance hitter on the club.
Harry Parsons is a reliable second
sacker, and has a steadying influence
on volatile Monty Pfyl. Elton Boone
returned from last year's squad to
work at thircl base. Boone hits clean
up, although he hasn't shown the
power at the plate that he had last
season. Harry Wolter expects him
to start pounding the ball again soon.
"Old Reliable" Norm Juney, left
fielder, covers a lot of ground in the
gardens and is the most consistent
hitter on the club to date. Norm got
two for four in Santa Clara Sat
urday.
So the stuff is there for a good
ball club, and with the league as
evenly balanced as it is, the Cards
might wake up on top of the heap
some balmy day this spring.

STANFORD'S HORSEIIIDE . . .

Bill did. Jack Randall is a good
backstop, but his stickwork hasn't
been very impressive as yet. Herb
Atkinson is the most consistent hit
ter of the three candidates for the
job, but his lack of size is against
him.
FOUR JUNIOR COLLEGE . . .
Transfers have won places in the j
Card batting order, three of them
from San Mateo J. C. A trio of
regulars from last year's team round
out the opening roster.
The three former Bulldogs are
Alex Cereghino, Hal Costello, and
Frank Pfyl. Cereghino stepped into
the center field spot soon after the
practice season got under way. He's
the lead-off man in the batting or
der, and Saturday singled to drive
in the only Stanford run. "Cherry"
takes his cuts from the first base
side of the plate.
Frank Pfyl, twin brother of Monty
Pfyl, first-string short stop, won the
right field job from Jack Parsons
and Jim Verdieck. Hal Costello, an
other ex-San Matean, holds down the
initial sack and is the most danger
ous long distance hitter on the club.
Harry Parsons is a reliable second
sacker, and has a steadying influence
on volatile Monty Pfyl. Elton Boone
returned from last year's squad to
work at thircl base. Boone hits clean
up, although he hasn't shown the
power at the plate that he had last
season. Harry Wolter expects him
to start pounding the ball again soon.
"Old Reliable" Norm Juney, left
fielder, covers a lot of ground in the
gardens and is the most consistent
hitter on the club to date. Norm got
two for four in Santa Clara Sat
urday.
So the stuff is there for a good
ball club, and with the league as
evenly balanced as it is, the Cards
might wake up on top of the heap
some balmy day this spring.

STANFORD'S HORSEIIIDE . . .
Chasers opened their league sea- I
son on a gfloomy Saturday last ]
week-end by dropping a 2-1 heart- j
breaker to Santa Clara's touted |
Broncos. The defeat put the Cards j
in the cellar of the California Inter- 1
collegiate Baseball Association, but j
with the material on hand, it's not!
impossible that Harry Wolter's boys :
will wind up on top when the pen- !
nant scramble ends late in April.
Quentin Thompson, big right
handed hurler who considers the I
day lost when he allows more than j
half a dozen hits, is the Farm nine's
biggest asset. The backbone of a
well-balanced mound staff, Cootie
probably set some kind of a league
record last year for games lost by
one run. Unless someone cuts his
throwing arm off at the shoulder,
Thompson will be able to take his
pick of major league contracts when
he hangs up his Stanford uniform
for the last time in the spring of '41.
Claude Purkitt is another right
hander who can be counted on for
some winning efforts this spring.
"Purk" isn't as fast as Thompson,
but his control has improved
greatly since last season, and ho was
just lis effective as Coot in the prac
tice games. He'll probably start
against St. Mary's in Seals Stadium
tomorrow night.
A QUARTET . . .
Four good pitchers are on hand to ]
t:»ki; over if either of the starting j
moundsmen falters. Bill Masters has
been slow rounding into top form
this year, but off last season's rec
ords his effectiveness should im
prove. Sophomore Russ Smith is the
only portsider on the staff. Harry
Dyck, a newcomer to the squad,
worked well in the practice games.
Sid Hayes, who takes time out be
tween flights of hurdles to throw
strikes, has improved steadily since
hfe came out.
The receiving corps took it on the
chin when Captain Bill Jameson
was declared ineligible. Big Sid
Lewis, who took his place in the
line-up, is a good catcher and han
dles the moundsmen well, but can't
pick runners off the bases the way
Bill did. Jack Randall is a good
backstop, but his stickwork hasn't
been very impressive as yet. Herb
