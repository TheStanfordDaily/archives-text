# Frosh Hoopsters Warm Up for Cal
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman basketball
team had a light practice yesterday
with stifTer work scheduled for this
afternoon in preparation for their
last-lap series with the Cal frosh
Friday and Saturday. Coach H. B.
Lee's charges have a chance to hang
up the best record set by a Card
frosh five in a decade.
Wins in the final series this week
end will mean a season slate with
only one loss in sixteen frays. Last
year's Papoose cagers dropped only
three games. Friday night's tilt will
be at Berkeley as a preliminary to
the varsity clash. Saturday night
the teams move to the Pavilion.
