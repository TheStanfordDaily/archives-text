# Runner-up Spot at Stake When Indian Meets Bear In Week-end Cage Battles
## Dean Limits Practice to Two Days As Cards Rest after U.S.C. Tilts; Records Promise Close Contests 
### 
Since their upset victory over Southern California a week and a half
ago, California's baslcetballcrs have had the idea that they, and not Stan
ford, will win the runner up position to Troy in the Southern Division of
the Pacific Coast Conference.
But since Stanford's well earned victory over those same Southern

►California eagers, it seems that the
| Bears' chance of beating out or even
tying Coach Everett Dean's men is
I less than average. However, proof
ol whether Cal or Stanford will gain
that second place in the conference
will come this week-end when Bear
meets Indian on Friday and again
on Saturday night.
COACH LIMITS PRACTICE
Again Coach Dean will limit prac
tice for the Cards to two days this
week. Only today and tomorrow
will the Indians prepare for their
trip to Berkeley on Friday and for
j the return visit by Cal's towering
| cagers on Saturday.
I In the first encounter, Dean's men
j ran rampant, smothering the Bears
j 55-32; but in the second contest they
| folded in the final minutes to give
j Cal a tight 38-3G win. It's true that
Nibs Price's coaching has finally tak
en effect at Cal, and the Bears have
improved noticeably. Still they will
have trouble with a Stanford outfit
that beat them handily in the first
meeting and since then beat U.S.C.,
supposedly the best team in the
country, at its best game.

Robinson has again taken over the
league scoring lead which he re
linquished to Vaughn for a week.
Dale Sears, roly poly Trojan center,
moved ahead of Stanford's Don
Williams as the result of last week
end's games. However, Ken David
son maintained his fifth place posi
tion and the title as the highest
scoring guard in the conference.

Since their upset victory over Southern California a week and a half
ago, California's baslcetballcrs have had the idea that they, and not Stan
ford, will win the runner up position to Troy in the Southern Division of
the Pacific Coast Conference.
But since Stanford's well earned victory over those same Southern

►California eagers, it seems that the
| Bears' chance of beating out or even
tying Coach Everett Dean's men is
I less than average. However, proof
ol whether Cal or Stanford will gain
that second place in the conference
will come this week-end when Bear
meets Indian on Friday and again
on Saturday night.
COACH LIMITS PRACTICE
Again Coach Dean will limit prac
tice for the Cards to two days this
week. Only today and tomorrow
will the Indians prepare for their
trip to Berkeley on Friday and for
j the return visit by Cal's towering
| cagers on Saturday.
I In the first encounter, Dean's men
j ran rampant, smothering the Bears
j 55-32; but in the second contest they
| folded in the final minutes to give
j Cal a tight 38-3G win. It's true that
Nibs Price's coaching has finally tak
en effect at Cal, and the Bears have
improved noticeably. Still they will
have trouble with a Stanford outfit
that beat them handily in the first
meeting and since then beat U.S.C.,
supposedly the best team in the
country, at its best game.
JACKIE LEADS SCORERS
Robinson has again taken over the
league scoring lead which he re
linquished to Vaughn for a week.
Dale Sears, roly poly Trojan center,
moved ahead of Stanford's Don
Williams as the result of last week
end's games. However, Ken David
son maintained his fifth place posi
tion and the title as the highest
scoring guard in the conference.
The rating of the first five confer
ence scorers is as follows:
Player Team FG FT TP
Robinson U.C.L.A. 52 31 135
Vaughn U.S.C. 49 30 128
Sears U.S.C. 37 23 97
