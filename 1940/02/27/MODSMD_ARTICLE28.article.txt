# Indian Ruggers Point for Title
## Two More Games Win Championship 
### 
With two more league games to
play, the Stanford rugby team stands
an excellent chance of winning the
championships of both the North
ern California Rugby League and
the Intercollegiate League.
At the present time the Indians
lead the Northern California League
with no defeats. California and the
Olympic Club are tied for second
place with one loss each. Since the
Cards play the O. C. next Saturday,
and the Bears the following Satur
day. a win over either team will as
sure them of no worse than a tie
for the championship, while victories
in both games will clinch the top
spot.
With only Cal, S.C., and Stanford
in the Intercollegiate league, the
Cards are now in second place
standing. Cal leads, following their
3-0 win over the Trojans last Sat
urday on a 50-yard penally kick.
In this league, only the Stanford-
S.C. 0-0 tie counts in the stand
ings,* becaues the second game with
the Troymen, which the Indians
dropped, was listed as a courtesy
game. Thus, if the Big Red gets by
Cal two weeks hence, they will
clinch the intercollegiate pennant.
Last year Stanford wound up in a
three-way tie with Cal and S.C. for
the championship in the Intercolle
giate League, and took second place
to the Bcrkeleyites in the Northern
California League.
Harry Maloney, director of minor
sports and accurate mental statis
tician of more than three decades of
Stanford athletics, comes up with
the information that the Cardinal
ruggers have dropped only five
games in the last eight years, and
have won the championships of both
leagues three times each during
that period.
