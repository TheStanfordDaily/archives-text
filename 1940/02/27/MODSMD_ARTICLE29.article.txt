# Frosh Cancel Cinder Debut
## 
### 
The 1940 debut of the freshman
track squad has been washed off the
map with the San Mateo J.C. open
er indefinitely and a
probable cancellation of this week's
Sacramento J. C. meet in the offing.
Coach Jack Weiershauser said
yesterday that the proximity of the
San Mateo school would enable a
midweek cinderfest between the
Bulldogs and Little Injuns later in
the season.
The frosh did their bit in last
week's twilight meet, with Bob
Smith turning in a good 660 and
Bud Sherman clearing 11 ft. 6 in. in
the pole vault. Vern Hart, standout
high jumper, did not compete.
Both varsity and freshman squads
are thoroughly rained out for at
least two days.
