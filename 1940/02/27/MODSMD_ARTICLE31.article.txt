# Frosh Nine Cancels San Jose High Tilt
## 
### 
Rain has forced postponement of
the freshman baseball squad's game
today with San Jose High. Coach
Harry Shipkey said the tilt will be
run off later in the week, probably
Saturday morning, weather permit
ting. San Mateo J. C. will play here
Friday at 3:30 o'clock.

Most sprinters run the 100-yard
dash without breathing.
