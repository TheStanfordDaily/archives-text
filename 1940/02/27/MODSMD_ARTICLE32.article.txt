AIMING TO HAVE THE FASTEST squad in the Pacific baseball loop, the Los Angeles club has engaged
Dean Cromwell, U.S.C. track coach, to teach the boys seme speed tactics. Slow base-running was blamed
for L.A.'s pennant loss last year. Here Cromwell is instructing Gordon Donaldson and Lou Stringer in the
art of fast starting.
