# Safety Raids
## 
### 
IT won't be very often that these columns will
harp on the same subject on successive days,
but six thousand motorists were halted in Santa
Clara County Sunday in a "safety raid" con
ducted by California State Highway patrolmen,
the county police, deputy sheriffs, and liquor
enforcement agents. A move such as that
should make some of us rush out for quick re
pair jobs on these thunder-buggies in which we
whiz up and down the Peninsula highways.
Only the current torrential fogs kept that
crew of 30 "little. G-men" from rounding up
fifteen or twenty thousand of our local drivers.
The first star-light night will undoubtedly see
a continuance of this four-wheel purge that by
now should have you shaking in your wet
weather boots.
Drivers are being apprehended for everything
from sobriety (or the lack of it) to the driver's
license that is inevitably parked at home in the
top bureau drawer. The correction of steering
and lighting malformations is equally as im
portant in this current drive as avoidance of
that now famous two jiggers alcohol, one jigger
gasoline cocktail.
Four immediate solutions to save your legal
necks seem imminent:
1. Pay cash to have your cars put in proper
running order.
2. Charge repairs at a Paly garage where
every Stanford man is considered a good credit
risk.
3. Leave your car at home.
4. Leave your car at the last place where you
happen to remember what you are doing.
