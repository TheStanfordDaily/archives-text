# Mud in Your Eye!
## 
### 
T ELAND STANFORD Jr. University in the
-L-j past four years has made many far-reaching
improvements on buildings and grounds—the
Frost Amphitheater, Memorial Hall, Cubberley
Education Building, the new Hoover War Li
brary, one of the most outstanding libraries in
the country, and a paved parking lot for the pro
fessors. But the Libe parking lot goes on for
ever.
It remains still one of the few traditions left
on the covered walks of the Stanford Quad
rangle.
Year after year during the rainy season, stu
dents drive in through a thousand muddy lakes,
large and small, park their cars any which way
no matter whether the other fellow can get
out or not—and slop their way through a sea
of wet dust into the libe or to class.
The more it rains, the more cars must be ac
commodated, because students who ordinarily
walk to class or to the libe bring cars to school
in wet weather.
While it is difficult to keep the approach from
being cut up by trucks, the University in order
to alleviate the situation somewhat might (1)
gravel the parking lot, thus eliminating the mud;
(2) mark off set parking places, leaving all places
with a way out into an alley-way circling
through the lot.—G. H.
