MELLINKOFF. SIR:
I have heard that the greatest compliment that
one can bestow on a newspaper columnist is to let

him know that his stuir is being read, even by one
person. In spite of this I can't resist the urge to put
in my two cents worth concerning "Red Herrings."
"A third term is dangerousâ€”dictatorial." Well, per
haps not, but with 150 years precedent to support it,
it would seem that the burden of proof is upon the
advocates. The fact that a third term is seriously con
sidered is indicative of a change of thought or condi
tions. Until we are sure what that change is we may
well consider it dangerous. It has always seemed to
me that power is either a cause or a manifestation of
dictatorship. F.D.R. has more power than any other
president has had. A third term would in all proba
bility lead to an increase in that power and certainly
an extension of that already given. Of course this is
not perfect reasoning, but isn't it enough to justify the
approach that a third term might be dangerous? It
seemed to me that your answer to the "red herring,"
when reduced to its simplest form, was merely, "A
third term is not dangerous, not dictatorial, so there."
You aroused my sense of justice by drawing one red
herring across another.
The word, "narcosis" not inc. I had to look it up.
I agree perfectly with you here, especially if you meant
that F.D.R. was the "dope."
After seven years I have succumbed to the insane
urge to write a "Campus Opinion," in sorrow, I remain
Very truly yours,
W. N. Snell
