### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
BLUE RIBBONS AND BULLETS
IVAPOLEON BONAPARTE was a great general; he
knew how to get his soldiers to die for him. He
knew the heart-moving phrases about honor and glory
and the decorations and the standards of bravery. "A
man will die die," Napoleon wrote, "for a motto or a
blue ribbon."
Modern generals, dictators, and statesmen are prov
ing the truth of Napoleons' psychology lesson every
day. It is very probable that the Finnish and the Rus
sian soldiers who are co-operating with the cold in
killing one another do not understand the great
"causes" for which they are fighting. If Ivanavitch,
the Russian, and Paavo, the Finn, understand the
forces behind their battles they are way ahead of at
least some of the world's most famous minds, because
the experts disagree. But Ivanavitch and Paavo will
die—not for the causes which they do not understand,
but for flowery speeches and society's verbal medals
for bravery.
Prime Minister Chamberlain says, "British soldiers
know they are fighting for the right; lhat is our great
est strength." Maybe the "graying, 71-year-old Prime
Minister" knows what he is talking about. But it is
doubtful that British privates know what he is talking
about. Surely they do not understand the economic
struggles of the British Empire that have laid the
foundations for what Chamberlain calls "the right."
But what the British "Tommy" does respond to is the
uplifting rhetoric—the emotion and not the thought in
corporated in such words as "right," "honor," and
"God's cause."

A ND the most obvious case of soldiers who die for
causes they do not understand is behind the
Siegfried Line in Germany. How can German pri
vates understand the Nazi ideals when Hitler prob
ably doesn't understand them himself? How can any
one make sense out of "Deutschland Über Alios,"
which translated into "Germany Over All" makes just
as little sense as it does in German?
The favorite verbal theme to cover up some ma
terialistic cause, of course, is an appeal to the Divinity.
Surely God cannot be on the side of Chamberlain and
the side of Hitler at the same time. But in the last
few days German and British leaders have told their
peoples that they can't lose, because any nation and
God are always a majority.
A. E. Housman has a very intelligent comment to
make on this sort of military appeal to God. He de
scribes the flaring beacons of the English countryside
—burning to celebrate Queen Victoria's 50th birthday.
Everyone is shouting, "God save the Queen!"
And Housman says,
"Oh God will save her; fear you not.
Be you the men you've been,
Get you the sons your fathers got,
And God will save the Queen."

Siegfried Line in Germany. How can German pri
vates understand the Nazi ideals when Hitler prob
ably doesn't understand them himself? How can any
one make sense out of "Deutschland Über Alios,"
which translated into "Germany Over All" makes just
as little sense as it does in German?
The favorite verbal theme to cover up some ma
terialistic cause, of course, is an appeal to the Divinity.
Surely God cannot be on the side of Chamberlain and
the side of Hitler at the same time. But in the last
few days German and British leaders have told their
peoples that they can't lose, because any nation and
God are always a majority.
A. E. Housman has a very intelligent comment to
make on this sort of military appeal to God. He de
scribes the flaring beacons of the English countryside
—burning to celebrate Queen Victoria's 50th birthday.
Everyone is shouting, "God save the Queen!"
And Housman says,
"Oh God will save her; fear you not.
Be you the men you've been,
Get you the sons your fathers got,
And God will save the Queen."

IVAPOLEON BONAPARTE was a great general; he
knew how to get his soldiers to die for him. He
knew the heart-moving phrases about honor and glory
and the decorations and the standards of bravery. "A
man will die die," Napoleon wrote, "for a motto or a
blue ribbon."
Modern generals, dictators, and statesmen are prov
ing the truth of Napoleons' psychology lesson every
day. It is very probable that the Finnish and the Rus
sian soldiers who are co-operating with the cold in
killing one another do not understand the great
"causes" for which they are fighting. If Ivanavitch,
the Russian, and Paavo, the Finn, understand the
forces behind their battles they are way ahead of at
least some of the world's most famous minds, because
the experts disagree. But Ivanavitch and Paavo will
die—not for the causes which they do not understand,
but for flowery speeches and society's verbal medals
for bravery.
Prime Minister Chamberlain says, "British soldiers
know they are fighting for the right; lhat is our great
est strength." Maybe the "graying, 71-year-old Prime
Minister" knows what he is talking about. But it is
doubtful that British privates know what he is talking
about. Surely they do not understand the economic
struggles of the British Empire that have laid the
foundations for what Chamberlain calls "the right."
But what the British "Tommy" does respond to is the
uplifting rhetoric—the emotion and not the thought in
corporated in such words as "right," "honor," and
"God's cause."
