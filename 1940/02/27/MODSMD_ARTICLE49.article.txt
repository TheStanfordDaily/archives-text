When the guy with the cabin down near Gilroy and
his friend asked the two Gamma Phis to go down there
with them on a Saturday, they had it all planned.
This cabin was at a lonely place near Gilroy. which
is saying a lot because Gilroy is a lonely place to
begin with.
The gills thought they were going on a picnic; calm
and peaceful; social, at least.
But when they got there, the guys proposed a hike.
"Just a little walk, you know."
The little wnlk w;is 7 miles over rough country, to
say nothing of being over hills. It lasted, naturally,
several hours. At the end, the girls had tired feet, sore
muscles, and torn stockings. Later they found they had
poison oak as well.
They got back to school tired and hysterical, on
the verge of laughing or crying.
They told the sisters what had happened.
"Oh, so you were rung in on that," one of the sis
ters said. "So was I once. Those two 'gentlemen' are
looking for wives. They use that hike as a test. They
say it proves whether a girl has a sense of humor
or not."
