The Young Melbourne, by Lord
David Cecil.
Anything written about the Lord
Byron - Caroline Lamb - Lord Mel
bourne affair is almost bound to have
an element of bias in it. It was prob
ably the most spectacular scandal of
the nineteenth century. It was the
only contemporary topic of conver
sation among the Old World "elite"
that rivaled the stor> of Napoleon.
Lord Cecil has handled with fair
ness Ills biography of William Lamb
before he became the second Vis
count Melbourne and Prime Minis
ter of England—a difficult task when
literary historians are still arguing
over Melbourne, his eccentric wife
Lady Caroline, and Byron.
BYRON ACHIEVES FAME
Byron was an obscure country
lord in 1812 when the first part of
his romantic poem "Childe Harold"
was published. In that year Byron,
as he himself later described it,
awoke one morning and found him
self famous.
From then on for four years the
idolized poet, the lion of London
society, pursued his merry, tragic
way, forming liaisons with the wives
of the ruling nobles (the first of
whom was Caroline Lamb), until so
cial ostracism finally forced him into
exile for the rest of his life.
AITAIR OBSCURES CAREER
"L'affaire Byron" dominated all of
the early part of William Lamb's
public career; that is, until both his
wife and Byron were dead in 1826.
The author depicts his subject dur
ing this time as the faithful, forgiv
ing husband ,but as being so only
because it was the path of least re
sistance.
William Lamb's mother, the first
Lady Melbourne, was a brilliant,
gifted leader of Whig society, who
completely dominated her son. Thus,
she secured for him, practically by
right of inheritance, his public of
fices. lie had to exert very little
effort, and was therefore made some
what of a coward. He became skill
ful at the art of compromise, and was

[ inevitably a cynic.
j Excusing many of her escapades us
I evidences of her oncoming insanity,
I Lord Cecil is perhaps too generous to
i Caroline Limb. Her escapades were
[ well known long before her mental
I breakdown, and her eccentricities
j might just as easily have been the
I cause of the later insanity.
"The Young Melbourne" is a good,
well-written book of a difficult, in
teresting, and very human man. It
is worth reading as much for the
presentation of the English Regency
country gentleman background as
! for the character study. Let us hope
j that Lord Cecil will give u.s the
I rest, and probably the most outstand
-1 ing part, of Lord Melbourne's life.—
