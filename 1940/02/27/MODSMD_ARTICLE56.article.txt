# Men's Vocom Hears Engineer
## 
### 
Hubert H. Hall, chief engineer of
the Standard Oil Company of Cali
fornia, gave the seventh of the
Men's Vocational Guidance talks last
night at Encina. "Engineering" was
the subject of the talk.
Mr. Hall pointed out that engi
neering is the application of science
in the solving of practical problems,
and said that over half of those who
graduate with engineering degrees
never practice, that many of the
others use it as a stepping stone to
other jobs, and that there was a
special field for metallurgical engi
ners at the present time.
Business School experience is val
uable to the engineer in addition to
the fundamental science courses, Mi-
Hall said.
.The la.it talk of the scries will be
given next week by Dean Kirk wood
of the Stanford Law School.
