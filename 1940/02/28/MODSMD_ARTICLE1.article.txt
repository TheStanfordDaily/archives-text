# History ...1940

### WILSON CANNON 
r JPHE President is still playing the
role of a sphinx, but he isn't
losing any of his 1940 chances by
doing it.
For Roosevelt's nerve-racking si
lence on the third-term question is
continuing to'make more noise than
any of the Republican voices which
have almost monopolized political
microphones during the past two
weeks.
But in playing the lone hand
which he dealt himself when he
snapped at reporters a short time
ago by refusing to deny or affirm
reports (hat the Roosevelt fedora
would again land in the presiden
tial ring, the man in the White
House is continuing to keep poker
faced Jim Farley, Democratic Na
tional Chairman, behind the eight
hall.
Farley's Republican counterpart,
John Hamilton, has already un
leashed a wave of G.O.P. aspirants,
formed a list of platform sugges
tions, and begun a nation-wide flood
of assurances that a new Utopia will
come under a Republican adminis
tration.
Farley's hands remain tied. Until
Roosevelt, whom both parties admit
is by far the best standard bearer
the Democrats can find for 1940,
makes his decision, the big Post
master General can only toot the
Democratic whistle ... he can't
set the wheels rolling.

in the meantime, hopefuls
such as Vice-President John
Nance Garner, Henry A. Wallace,
Cordell Hull, Harold L. lekes, and
Paul V. McNutt are not letting Miss
Democratic Party forget that they
would appreciate an invitation to
the big doings next November. Even
Farley has eased his hat over close
to the ring in preparation for the
Democratic Convention July 15.
How these aspirants would re
act to a third-term declaration by
the President is not known even
by those well versed in Capitol
affairs. But the general run of
opinion indicates that they are
clearing the way for a fight to the
finish . . . even if Roosevelt sails
in and drydocks himself on the
ways that will launch him for a
third try at the White House.
That the G.O.P. is not underesti
mating the likelihood of such a
move by the President was shown
last week when Republican spokes
man Hamilton issued a challenge in
which he urged Roosevelt to run
because then "we would have a
showdown on the New Deal, Frank
lin Roosevelt, and the third term â€”
and we would finish off all three."

Jj > UT Republican pep meetings, al
though outwardly dripping with
opt imism, are overshadowed by a
realization that Roosevelt would be
a hard campaigner to beat in No
vember . . . always provided that
conservative Democrats do not bolt
the Presidential stables during the
Chicago Democratic primaries in
July.
Republican wheelhorses, who re
alize that the time to make progress
is while the opposition is mired in
the mud of uncertainty, are pushing
their candidates through the late
fall months before spring ushers in
the fishing season and Roosevelt
prepares for four more years as
president.
Onlookers see Robert A. Taft
running away with the delegate
hunt; racket-busting Thomas E.
Dewey barnstorming the country;
still-coy Arthur 11. Vandcnberg
moving into a strategic position;
and former President Herbert
Hoover gathering momentum in
the national spotlight. Party
spokesmen give these aspirants an
inside track for the Republican
bid during the June 21 convention
in Philadelphia.
But. the third-term bugaboo still
hangs over the G.O.P. banner, de
spite yesterday's move by the Re
publican-controlled New York Sen
ate (Roosevelt's home state) in which
they memorialized him or any other
president not to seek a third period
of office.
