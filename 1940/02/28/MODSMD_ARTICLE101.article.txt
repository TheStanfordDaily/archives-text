buying gabardine shirts to wear as
light jackets over their blouses.
And the men retreat faster into,
any safe places they can find, taking J
with them what is left of all their j
possessions which Stanford women j
have not expropriated as smart and .
cute to adapt to their own casual i
fashions.
Years ago women calmly took to '
slacks, beer jackets, sweaters, and j
the rest, but, as one man remarked,
they had the grace to adapt, not to j
steal outright. The majority of men's
shops in Palo Alto share this view,
and deplore, at the same time, Farm i
women's buying clothes outright j
from the men's departments, and
carrying them off to "push the '<
sleeves up and the rest of it!"
"The other day," this same shop
owner said bitterly, "one of these
girls came in and asked about odd
jackets in natural camel's hair.
WANTED MAN'S COAT
"They were for men, I told her. j
It didn't matter. A friend of hers;
had bought and was wearing a small j
man's coat, and everybody thought
it was smart.
"I finally persuaded her that we
couldn't get one small enough for
her. I have to protect my regular
customers."
Another dealer, down the street,:
"The men fight shy of clothes they
see women going around in. No
man wants to feel that he's going to
meet up with his own jacket, worn
with a string of pearls."
ADOPT CUMMERBUNDS
Even the field of formal dress was
invaded a while back when there
was started a small run on black
isilk cummerbunds, which the women
I wore with tailored formals to make
j their middles look smaller.
: Other examples of devitalizing
; men's fashions are women's pur
. chases of heavy work shoes to wear
i with woolen socks — again, men's
! socks; but not striped—and they're
buying gabardine shirts to wear as
light jackets over their blouses.
