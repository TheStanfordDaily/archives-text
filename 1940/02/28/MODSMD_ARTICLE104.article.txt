# For the Easter Parade
## 
### BY ROSEMARIE MULLANY 
The Easter outfit this year will summarize a season which has intro
duced no radical trends, has effected no sweeping changes in established
styles, lines, or colors. Apparent, however, are the influences of the South
American boom and the militaristic struggle raging abroad.
Looking like a vestige from some general's jacket is the self-material

cording which binds the coat of a,
faded rose dressmaker suit now being
shown in one of the Palo Alto em
poriums. Consisting of a %'inple, one
piece dress and a tailored coat with
a flared, gored skirt, the ensemble is
one which would lend itself to a va
riety of accessory changes.
ADAPTED TO ACCESSORIES
The perennial blue of spring would
harmonize with the old rose of the
costume for the present season; later
brown could be used. The simple,
semi-V neckline of the dress also
adapts itself well to costume jewelry
touches. The coat exaggerates the V
of the dress neckline and reveals
most «>f the dress front.
More on the breezy side is the
black and white striped jersey dress
being shown at the same shop. It
features one of the few definite
trends apparent at present: the ex
tended torso line. Used with a
striped material, it completely en
cases the torso in black, revealing
a peasant type shirtwaist, and an
all-around pleated skirt.
ACCENTED IN RED
Accented with a red belt, the dress
provides ample opportunity for many
different colored accessories.
The severe, lightweight-wool black
and/or blue coat for spring fills
rack upon rack in all shops at the
present time, varied with lapel gad
gets, white touches, and odd neck
lines.
The übiquitous print is just that.
Blue and white, grey and white cos
tumes are, however, all accented in
red this season. The flaring touches
do not stop with the dress, either.
They extend to hat, bag, and gloves.
GREY WITH RED
One grey outfit featured a short
sleeved bolero over a shirtwaist type
dress. The print is a circular white
one against the grey background.
Accents come in down-the-front
buttons which are covered in red
silk. A bunch of warm-colored
flowers on the shoulder completes
the effect.
Another grey outfit shows the same
red touches, differs only in that the
jacket is a longish, loosefiting
butcher-boy affair.
