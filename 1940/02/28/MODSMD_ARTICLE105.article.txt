# Spring Prints Use Trademark, Tweed Design
## 
### 
The trend in new prints seems to be
toward tilling up every conceivable
and available space on the material.
The resulting effect is a harmony of
color, gay and cheerful.
The dominant colors for this type
of print lean on the side of bright
blues, purples, and reds. Flowers
are the main design, but some of the
most popular prints are just splashes
of harmonious colors.
SILK LOOKS LIKE TWEED
One of the latest devices of the
fashion experts is the silk suit made
of a print designed to look like
tweed. The effect of seeing a smart
tweedy suit, become silk is most
startling. Here white is used as the
background color combined with
blues, wine, and brown.
Flowers are still the most popular
print design, ranging all the way
from little forget-me-nots to mam
moth chrysanthemums. Well - de
signed leaf displays are crowding the
(lowers as popular print designs, es
pecially since green has become an
important fashion color.
ISE TRADEMARKS
The newest fad in print designs
is Iho use of well-known trademarks
of large companies ranging from beer
manufacturers to a bus line. These
prints will be found mostly in cas
ual sport clothes rather than in
dressy afternoon frocks.
Cotton prints for formals arc as
popular as they were last year. Once
a jain flowers are the chief motif, but
small, many-colored moons and stars
on a white background are right in
keeping with the mood of a formal.
HUNT PLAY CLOTHES
Although the traditional white for
tennis courts had greatly influenced
tlu- materials for play clothes, the
gay cotton print will hold its own
in the play suits of this season. All
sorts of figures, from initials to Pin
oechio, will be found in gardens and
on heachcs.
The animated cartoons also have
their influence on the new prints.
Donald Duck, Ferdinand, and Pin
oechio have found their way onto
cool white cottons, not to mention
Snow White and her friends.
