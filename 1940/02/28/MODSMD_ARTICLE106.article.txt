# Hawaii Sends Spring Patterns
## 
### 
Because the tragedy that is En- |
rope of today cannot supply spring j
fashions in the gay mood, designers |
are turning to the Pacific, particu
larly Hawaii, for their ideas.
These are shown in the new cot
ton evening gowns with lei neck
lines and in the splashing flower j
patterns of the Tahitian playsuits. :
The gowns are usually patterned j
after the dirndl of the last two sea
sons, but the shirt-maker tops have
round necks, and are usually col
larless.
