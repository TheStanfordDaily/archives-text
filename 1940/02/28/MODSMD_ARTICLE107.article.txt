# Spring Toppers Show Gay Flare
## Flowers Decorate Brimmers or Berets 
### 
"Easter Bonnet" season previews
show women's hats a little less crazy,
with a definite flare for dashing
saneness.
Snoods are on the way out, though
the downward trend continues with
ribbons in the back and down hair
dos. Hats will be decorative thi: year
to give the light, confident touch to
spring costumes.
Flowers on the crowns with a
touch of veiling will prove very
popular to go with the increasingly
feminine trend in styles this year.
Birds continue in effectiveness for
gay bonnets, while brim bowlers
keep up with the fashions for sport
suits.
SAILOR BRIMS TO FORE
Sailors and wide brims have come
to the fore in styles for the mora
dressy suit, with straw as the most
popular for these styles. Fabrics
have a wide range this year with
ribbon, felt, straw, and angora hold
ing the limelight. Practical for all
round use is a new ripple belting
that is crush-proof and can be made
up in any color for casual, smart
hats.
Stitched angora for sport hats
along with hand embroidered yarn
designs on the crown of the new pas
tels, will be just the thing for a new
spring outfit in pastel chalk colors.
Long streamers, known as "beau
catchers" to grandmother, are back
after a year or so absence.
BICYCLE ERA STRAWS
Along with the "Back to grand
ma's days" trend comes the black
and white straw modelled on the
men's straws so popular in the "bi
cycle built for two" era.
Colors are following the military
influence in placing navy as tops
with red and white trim in ribbons,
buttons, braid, or what have you?
Natural straw is still seen to carry
on the movement to beiges, tans, and
khakis.
Gray is in for the military too, and
shows well with red. The latest col
or combinations to vie with patriotic
colors is navy, yellow, and red. which
strikes a bright note for spring
shades.
Hats this year can have any width
in brim and can be almost any basic
style, from sailors to berets and back
again.

SAILOR BRIMS TO FORE

to the fore in styles for the mora
dressy suit, with straw as the most
popular for these styles. Fabrics
have a wide range this year with
ribbon, felt, straw, and angora hold

that is crush-proof and can be made

hats.

spring outfit in pastel chalk colors.

catchers" to grandmother, are back

BICYCLE ERA STRAWS

ma's days" trend comes the black
and white straw modelled on the
men's straws so popular in the "bi
cycle built for two" era.
Colors are following the military
influence in placing navy as tops
with red and white trim in ribbons,
buttons, braid, or what have you?
Natural straw is still seen to carry
on the movement to beiges, tans, and
khakis.
Gray is in for the military too, and
shows well with red. The latest col
or combinations to vie with patriotic

in brim and can be almost any basic

again.
