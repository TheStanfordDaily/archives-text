# Parisians Strive For 'Ivory Tower'
## 
### 
Trying to preserve a semblance of
civilized life in that Parisian wartime
routine are the Baron and Baronne
Max de Reutern, prominent in the
Paris younger married set.
La Baronne has furnished a
French apartment in the spacious
manner—lots of room to move
around in—and has lighted the
rooms indirectly from decorative
plaster shells. Her husband is a di
rector of Paquin and is currently
engaged in launching a nfcw per
fume for that house.
