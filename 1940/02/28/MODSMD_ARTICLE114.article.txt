# Small Flowers Gain Popularity In Corsages
## 
### 
Spring ushers in a whole new
host of blossoms in the floral world.
Bright dalTodils, carnations, or Af
rican daisies are just the thing for
spring suits. Violets centered by a
dainty rose, too, are popular.
Wristlets of camellias, gardenias,
or small orchids with a matching
flower for the hair are making
headlines for evening wear. Dainti
ness and petiteness are the keys to
everything in flowers this spring.
Butterfly orchids are being featured
much more than the other types.
Small arrangements in little pas
tel vases are fast taking the place of
larger cut flowers which are difficult
to arrange, and take up more space
in a small room.
All sorts.of new things are being
done with flower headdresses. A
pixie cap of carnations or perhaps a
fragrant arrangement of bouvardia
and delicate dendrobium orchids
adds the finishing touch to any
lovely spring formal.
