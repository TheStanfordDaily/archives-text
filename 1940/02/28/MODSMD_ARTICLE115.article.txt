# Mexican Shoes Still Cross Border
## 
### 
Influences from south of I he border
have been creeping across the in
ternational boundary line in the form
of thousands of Mexican shoes and
gadgets yearly growing more popular
in the United States. The huarache
has made Mexico famous in Ameri
can fashion circles.
Newer types of huaraches consist
of merely two strips of leather which
cross over the toe. They look very
conspicuously handmade as they are
stitched up the back and around the
soles with saddle leather in different
shades. Some in the traditional style
have Aztec calendars carved on the
leather over the toes.
