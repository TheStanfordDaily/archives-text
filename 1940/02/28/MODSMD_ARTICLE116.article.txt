## 
### 
Springing up with the daffodils art' the ever-faithful redingotes and silk
prints. They are especially good tliis spring \vi(h the new draped Java
nese turbans of silk print to match the dress. They will look very nice
emerging from the Chapel on sunny Sunday mornings.
For practical peoplu who want a spring coat which will he ever right

( and ever smart, the shops are stock
ing variations of the navy blue reef
er. In a dressy material with a spic
and-span white pique collar and one
of the new little Dutch bonnets lop
ped with white pique flowers, a
"farmerette" is set for come-what
may—an evening of hotel dancing,
an afternoon of city shopping, or even
attending a spring wedding.
ADMIRAL'S STYLE
Other reefers being shown, and
worn, include sophisticated »navy
blue, in the Admiral style—four
rows of gold braid for cuffs and a
similar row of braid on the collar.
Also good are huge new pockets.
Double-breasted reefers, fly-front
reefers, and just plain reefers will
continue to be good throughout the
spring both for sports and dressy
occasions.
NEW PASTEL TWEEDS
Rivaling the reefer, topcoats are
marvelous in pastel tweeds. One of
the lovliest seen on Quad so far
this spring is a pastel plaid. Hounds
tooth checks in brown and white
and blue and white continue to be
popular.
Gray is headline news this spring
also, and Easter Sunday will prob
ably mark the debut of many a
new gray coat. Amazingly enough,
shirring and drapery styles are be
ing featured in the newest coats,
I giving very soft feminine lines to
[ the new coats.
