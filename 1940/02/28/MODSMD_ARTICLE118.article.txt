# For Spring!
## 
### BY JANET GOULD 
Anything goes.
That's the verdict on fashions
given by Palo Alto dress shops in
their spring openings Friday.
The college woman can blossom
in sprigged organdy or swagger in
tailored sharkskin; she can wear
past a Is or circus stripes; she can
live in classic box suits or princess
style broadcloth; she can have a low
waistiine or a high, snug one. In
fact she can do anything she likes
so long as she looks feminine.
STYLES ARE FEMININE
And even though every shop on
the other side of the street shows
diametrically opposite styles, each
one agrees that femininity is the
keynote of spring, more so this year
than ever before.
One designer from a high-priced
shop summed it up this way:
"Women want to look like women
this year. Perhaps it's the war, or
maybe it's the fact that we're draw
ing out of a very exaggeratedly ele
gant season- one that stressed all
the 'frou-frou' and fripperies of the
1870's on up.
"Casualness? Casual, don't-give
a-damn looks are over, except in
sport and play clothes. The custo
mer now has a less-lull figure, she's
more lithe, and she doesn't want
flounces and frills and confectionery
touches. Her effect is much more
controlled and subtle.
"In every way I think clothes are
more becoming this spring than ever
before. The average American col
lege woman didn't look 'elegant,'
anyway," she added.
VARIETY IS KEYNOTE
As an illustration of the diversi
fied styles that make up the new
trend, she pointed to a sky-blue
embroidered organdy dance dress,
one faintly reminiscent of high
school graduations, with puffed
sleeves, square and a fitted
bodice which tappered into a full
skirt with panier shirring over the
hips. A cluster of white flowers at
the corsage had streamers falling
almost to the hem, and the whole
effect, was, as the designer said, art
less.
On another mannequin, however,
was a dinner dress of striped silk
jersey with a deep V neckline, long
shirred waist, and a draped skirt.
Similarly, at a shop around the cor
ner was a two-piece ensemble of
candy-striped sharkskin skirt, cut
on the bias, and navy blue acetate
blouse with sharp shoulders and a
square neck. Only ornament was
six mother-of-pearl buttons, sewn
to represent a double-breasted jac
ket.
On down the street an evening
dress in the window was of black
chiffon, the skirt of which was al
ternate panels of black, chartreuse,
black and hydrangea blue. The
waistline was high. In the same
window appeared a pink creation
with a long torso line.
FULL SKIRTS POPULAR
Date dresses and afternoon frocks
agreed on one point: full skirts.
Pleated or gored, they all intensi
fied a trim hip-line and a small,
fit. waist. Necklines for spring were
high or V. sleeves had the moderated
boxlike shoulder, and came to the
elbow, to three inches above the
wrist, as well as three quarters of
the way to the elbow.
Everywhere was the classic shirt
maker, and its variations. Most of
the ones shown had the long line
buttoning down the front, flared
skirt, square shoulders, and a nar
row belt. These appeared all the
way from sheer wools to acetates to
broadcloth, the last emerging into
the play-suit category.
Suits, sports and dressmaker, were
on prominent display. In keeping
with the trend toward longer waist
lines, most of the jackets were fitted
and flat, and were around two inches
longer than the ones shown at this
time last year. Some outfits for
small people had square short boxy
little jackets, and the skirts were
mildly flared. The axiom for the
bob-tailed coats seemed to be to
have them collarless; the longer
jackets had the classic lapels with
man-tailoied shoulders.
BLOUSES ARE SHEER
With these ensembles the consen
sus of opinion pointed to sheer
blouses of chiffon or handkerchief
linen or batiste—very sturdy, the
saleswomen declared, in spite of their
looks.
Odd jackets are fewer for the com
ing season, but five shops had gam
bled heavily on the popularity of
sheer wool frocks, pastel, with
matching or contrasting tailored jac
kets.
Self-trimming aside from little
veils, great bunches of flowers, and
the rest, seemed to he most promi
nent. Four patch pockets, instead of
the usual two, appeared on most of
the jackets, as well as elaborate ar
rangements that looked like modified
little saddle-bags and pouches fairly
hiyh on the hips of some street suits.
Lots of covered buttons, with velvet
loops. Lots of shiny metal or mother
of pearl buttons. Quilting- good old
fashioned bedspread quilting—was
the sole ornament on many dress
maker suits, and extravagant col
lars and cufTs of starched stuff that
resembled a grandmothers "fancy
work" appeared a often as the more
conservative pique.
Colors were more uniform. Scar
let. left over from winter to touch
up print; s old land by navy blue

was very much in evidence, and ap
peared on warm grey wool suits and
dresses. Pastels are less water-color,
have an almost chalky appearance,
and run to thick pinks, the much
touted hydrangea blue, greyed blue,
pepper-and-salt greys, and some
thing called watermelon pink. Off
shades of blue, the shops announced,
are the best bet. Prints are shown,
as well, but they haven't reached
the summer stage.
Fabrics are diversified. New. and
very much stressed, was twill in its
various textures, then gabardine—
usually cotton—and the usual sheer
wools and acetates that imitate
everything from Cheney silks to
Forstmann wools. Heavy sharkskin
is being supplanted by a new fab
ric called luana cloth, which looks
like a light-weight version of Congo
cloth, used for tropical suits that
want to appear more substantial
! than linen. Very fine broadcloth that
i looks almost like a light poplin ap
{ pears in wash dresses, in the lower
I brackets, in "tub frocks" for a little
I more money, while sheer wool re

Anything goes.
That's the verdict on fashions
given by Palo Alto dress shops in
their spring openings Friday.
The college woman can blossom
in sprigged organdy or swagger in
tailored sharkskin; she can wear
past a Is or circus stripes; she can
live in classic box suits or princess
style broadcloth; she can have a low
waistiine or a high, snug one. In
fact she can do anything she likes
so long as she looks feminine.
STYLES ARE FEMININE
And even though every shop on
the other side of the street shows
diametrically opposite styles, each
one agrees that femininity is the
keynote of spring, more so this year
than ever before.
One designer from a high-priced
shop summed it up this way:
"Women want to look like women
this year. Perhaps it's the war, or
maybe it's the fact that we're draw
ing out of a very exaggeratedly ele
gant season- one that stressed all
the 'frou-frou' and fripperies of the
1870's on up.
"Casualness? Casual, don't-give
a-damn looks are over, except in
sport and play clothes. The custo
mer now has a less-lull figure, she's
more lithe, and she doesn't want
flounces and frills and confectionery
touches. Her effect is much more
controlled and subtle.
"In every way I think clothes are
more becoming this spring than ever
before. The average American col
lege woman didn't look 'elegant,'
anyway," she added.
VARIETY IS KEYNOTE
As an illustration of the diversi
fied styles that make up the new
trend, she pointed to a sky-blue
embroidered organdy dance dress,
one faintly reminiscent of high
school graduations, with puffed
sleeves, square and a fitted
bodice which tappered into a full
skirt with panier shirring over the
hips. A cluster of white flowers at
the corsage had streamers falling
almost to the hem, and the whole
effect, was, as the designer said, art
less.
On another mannequin, however,
was a dinner dress of striped silk
jersey with a deep V neckline, long
shirred waist, and a draped skirt.
Similarly, at a shop around the cor
ner was a two-piece ensemble of
candy-striped sharkskin skirt, cut
on the bias, and navy blue acetate
blouse with sharp shoulders and a
square neck. Only ornament was
six mother-of-pearl buttons, sewn
to represent a double-breasted jac
ket.
On down the street an evening
dress in the window was of black
chiffon, the skirt of which was al
ternate panels of black, chartreuse,
black and hydrangea blue. The
waistline was high. In the same
window appeared a pink creation
with a long torso line.
FULL SKIRTS POPULAR
Date dresses and afternoon frocks
agreed on one point: full skirts.
Pleated or gored, they all intensi
fied a trim hip-line and a small,
fit. waist. Necklines for spring were
high or V. sleeves had the moderated
boxlike shoulder, and came to the
elbow, to three inches above the
wrist, as well as three quarters of
the way to the elbow.
Everywhere was the classic shirt
maker, and its variations. Most of
the ones shown had the long line
buttoning down the front, flared
skirt, square shoulders, and a nar
row belt. These appeared all the
way from sheer wools to acetates to
broadcloth, the last emerging into
the play-suit category.
Suits, sports and dressmaker, were
on prominent display. In keeping
with the trend toward longer waist
lines, most of the jackets were fitted
and flat, and were around two inches
longer than the ones shown at this
time last year. Some outfits for
small people had square short boxy
little jackets, and the skirts were
mildly flared. The axiom for the
bob-tailed coats seemed to be to
have them collarless; the longer
jackets had the classic lapels with
man-tailoied shoulders.
BLOUSES ARE SHEER
With these ensembles the consen
sus of opinion pointed to sheer
blouses of chiffon or handkerchief
linen or batiste—very sturdy, the
saleswomen declared, in spite of their
looks.
Odd jackets are fewer for the com
ing season, but five shops had gam
bled heavily on the popularity of
sheer wool frocks, pastel, with
matching or contrasting tailored jac
kets.
Self-trimming aside from little
veils, great bunches of flowers, and
the rest, seemed to he most promi
nent. Four patch pockets, instead of
the usual two, appeared on most of
the jackets, as well as elaborate ar
rangements that looked like modified
little saddle-bags and pouches fairly
hiyh on the hips of some street suits.
Lots of covered buttons, with velvet
loops. Lots of shiny metal or mother
of pearl buttons. Quilting- good old
fashioned bedspread quilting—was
the sole ornament on many dress
maker suits, and extravagant col
lars and cufTs of starched stuff that
resembled a grandmothers "fancy
work" appeared a often as the more
conservative pique.
Colors were more uniform. Scar
let. left over from winter to touch
up print; s old land by navy blue

was very much in evidence, and ap
peared on warm grey wool suits and
dresses. Pastels are less water-color,
have an almost chalky appearance,
and run to thick pinks, the much
touted hydrangea blue, greyed blue,
pepper-and-salt greys, and some
thing called watermelon pink. Off
shades of blue, the shops announced,
are the best bet. Prints are shown,
as well, but they haven't reached
the summer stage.
Fabrics are diversified. New. and
very much stressed, was twill in its
various textures, then gabardine—
usually cotton—and the usual sheer
wools and acetates that imitate
everything from Cheney silks to
Forstmann wools. Heavy sharkskin

Anything goes.
That's the verdict on fashions
given by Palo Alto dress shops in
their spring openings Friday.
The college woman can blossom
in sprigged organdy or swagger in
tailored sharkskin; she can wear
past a Is or circus stripes; she can
live in classic box suits or princess
style broadcloth; she can have a low
waistiine or a high, snug one. In
fact she can do anything she likes
so long as she looks feminine.
STYLES ARE FEMININE
And even though every shop on
the other side of the street shows
diametrically opposite styles, each
one agrees that femininity is the
keynote of spring, more so this year
than ever before.
One designer from a high-priced
shop summed it up this way:
"Women want to look like women
this year. Perhaps it's the war, or
maybe it's the fact that we're draw
ing out of a very exaggeratedly ele
gant season- one that stressed all
the 'frou-frou' and fripperies of the
1870's on up.
"Casualness? Casual, don't-give
a-damn looks are over, except in
sport and play clothes. The custo
mer now has a less-lull figure, she's
more lithe, and she doesn't want
flounces and frills and confectionery
touches. Her effect is much more
controlled and subtle.
"In every way I think clothes are
more becoming this spring than ever
before. The average American col
lege woman didn't look 'elegant,'
anyway," she added.
VARIETY IS KEYNOTE
As an illustration of the diversi
fied styles that make up the new
trend, she pointed to a sky-blue
embroidered organdy dance dress,
one faintly reminiscent of high
school graduations, with puffed
sleeves, square and a fitted
bodice which tappered into a full
skirt with panier shirring over the
hips. A cluster of white flowers at
the corsage had streamers falling
almost to the hem, and the whole
effect, was, as the designer said, art
less.
On another mannequin, however,
was a dinner dress of striped silk
jersey with a deep V neckline, long
shirred waist, and a draped skirt.
Similarly, at a shop around the cor
ner was a two-piece ensemble of
candy-striped sharkskin skirt, cut
on the bias, and navy blue acetate
blouse with sharp shoulders and a
square neck. Only ornament was
six mother-of-pearl buttons, sewn
to represent a double-breasted jac
ket.
On down the street an evening
dress in the window was of black
chiffon, the skirt of which was al
ternate panels of black, chartreuse,
black and hydrangea blue. The
waistline was high. In the same
window appeared a pink creation
with a long torso line.
FULL SKIRTS POPULAR
Date dresses and afternoon frocks
agreed on one point: full skirts.
Pleated or gored, they all intensi
fied a trim hip-line and a small,
fit. waist. Necklines for spring were
high or V. sleeves had the moderated
boxlike shoulder, and came to the
elbow, to three inches above the
wrist, as well as three quarters of
the way to the elbow.
Everywhere was the classic shirt
maker, and its variations. Most of
the ones shown had the long line
buttoning down the front, flared
skirt, square shoulders, and a nar
row belt. These appeared all the
way from sheer wools to acetates to
broadcloth, the last emerging into
the play-suit category.
Suits, sports and dressmaker, were
on prominent display. In keeping
with the trend toward longer waist
lines, most of the jackets were fitted
and flat, and were around two inches
longer than the ones shown at this
time last year. Some outfits for
small people had square short boxy
little jackets, and the skirts were
mildly flared. The axiom for the
bob-tailed coats seemed to be to
have them collarless; the longer
jackets had the classic lapels with
man-tailoied shoulders.
BLOUSES ARE SHEER
With these ensembles the consen
sus of opinion pointed to sheer
blouses of chiffon or handkerchief
linen or batiste—very sturdy, the
saleswomen declared, in spite of their
looks.
Odd jackets are fewer for the com
ing season, but five shops had gam
bled heavily on the popularity of
sheer wool frocks, pastel, with
matching or contrasting tailored jac
kets.
Self-trimming aside from little
veils, great bunches of flowers, and
the rest, seemed to he most promi
nent. Four patch pockets, instead of
the usual two, appeared on most of
the jackets, as well as elaborate ar
rangements that looked like modified
little saddle-bags and pouches fairly
hiyh on the hips of some street suits.
Lots of covered buttons, with velvet
loops. Lots of shiny metal or mother
of pearl buttons. Quilting- good old
fashioned bedspread quilting—was
the sole ornament on many dress
maker suits, and extravagant col
lars and cufTs of starched stuff that
resembled a grandmothers "fancy
work" appeared a often as the more
conservative pique.
Colors were more uniform. Scar
let. left over from winter to touch
up print; s old land by navy blue

was very much in evidence, and ap
peared on warm grey wool suits and
dresses. Pastels are less water-color,
have an almost chalky appearance,

pepper-and-salt greys, and some
thing called watermelon pink. Off

Anything goes.
That's the verdict on fashions
given by Palo Alto dress shops in
their spring openings Friday.
The college woman can blossom
in sprigged organdy or swagger in
tailored sharkskin; she can wear
past a Is or circus stripes; she can
live in classic box suits or princess
style broadcloth; she can have a low
waistiine or a high, snug one. In
fact she can do anything she likes
so long as she looks feminine.
STYLES ARE FEMININE
And even though every shop on
the other side of the street shows
diametrically opposite styles, each
one agrees that femininity is the
keynote of spring, more so this year
than ever before.
One designer from a high-priced
shop summed it up this way:
"Women want to look like women
this year. Perhaps it's the war, or
maybe it's the fact that we're draw
ing out of a very exaggeratedly ele
gant season- one that stressed all
the 'frou-frou' and fripperies of the
1870's on up.
"Casualness? Casual, don't-give
a-damn looks are over, except in
sport and play clothes. The custo
mer now has a less-lull figure, she's
more lithe, and she doesn't want
flounces and frills and confectionery
touches. Her effect is much more
controlled and subtle.
"In every way I think clothes are
more becoming this spring than ever
before. The average American col
lege woman didn't look 'elegant,'
anyway," she added.
VARIETY IS KEYNOTE
As an illustration of the diversi
fied styles that make up the new
trend, she pointed to a sky-blue
embroidered organdy dance dress,
one faintly reminiscent of high
school graduations, with puffed
sleeves, square and a fitted
bodice which tappered into a full
skirt with panier shirring over the
hips. A cluster of white flowers at
the corsage had streamers falling
almost to the hem, and the whole
effect, was, as the designer said, art
less.
On another mannequin, however,
was a dinner dress of striped silk
jersey with a deep V neckline, long
shirred waist, and a draped skirt.
Similarly, at a shop around the cor
ner was a two-piece ensemble of
candy-striped sharkskin skirt, cut
on the bias, and navy blue acetate
blouse with sharp shoulders and a
square neck. Only ornament was
six mother-of-pearl buttons, sewn
to represent a double-breasted jac
ket.
On down the street an evening
dress in the window was of black
chiffon, the skirt of which was al
ternate panels of black, chartreuse,
black and hydrangea blue. The
waistline was high. In the same
window appeared a pink creation
with a long torso line.
FULL SKIRTS POPULAR
Date dresses and afternoon frocks
agreed on one point: full skirts.
Pleated or gored, they all intensi
fied a trim hip-line and a small,
fit. waist. Necklines for spring were
high or V. sleeves had the moderated
boxlike shoulder, and came to the
elbow, to three inches above the
wrist, as well as three quarters of
the way to the elbow.
Everywhere was the classic shirt
maker, and its variations. Most of
the ones shown had the long line
buttoning down the front, flared
skirt, square shoulders, and a nar
row belt. These appeared all the
way from sheer wools to acetates to
broadcloth, the last emerging into
the play-suit category.
Suits, sports and dressmaker, were
on prominent display. In keeping
with the trend toward longer waist
lines, most of the jackets were fitted
and flat, and were around two inches
longer than the ones shown at this
time last year. Some outfits for
small people had square short boxy
little jackets, and the skirts were
mildly flared. The axiom for the
bob-tailed coats seemed to be to
have them collarless; the longer
jackets had the classic lapels with
man-tailoied shoulders.
BLOUSES ARE SHEER
With these ensembles the consen
sus of opinion pointed to sheer
blouses of chiffon or handkerchief
linen or batiste—very sturdy, the
saleswomen declared, in spite of their
looks.
Odd jackets are fewer for the com
ing season, but five shops had gam
bled heavily on the popularity of
sheer wool frocks, pastel, with
matching or contrasting tailored jac
kets.
Self-trimming aside from little
veils, great bunches of flowers, and
the rest, seemed to he most promi
nent. Four patch pockets, instead of
the usual two, appeared on most of
the jackets, as well as elaborate ar
rangements that looked like modified
little saddle-bags and pouches fairly
hiyh on the hips of some street suits.
Lots of covered buttons, with velvet
loops. Lots of shiny metal or mother
of pearl buttons. Quilting- good old
fashioned bedspread quilting—was
the sole ornament on many dress
maker suits, and extravagant col
lars and cufTs of starched stuff that
resembled a grandmothers "fancy
work" appeared a often as the more
conservative pique.
Colors were more uniform. Scar
let. left over from winter to touch
up print; s old land by navy blue

was very much in evidence, and ap
peared on warm grey wool suits and
dresses. Pastels are less water-color,
have an almost chalky appearance,
