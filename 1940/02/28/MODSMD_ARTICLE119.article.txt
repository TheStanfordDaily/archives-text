# Turbans Catch Spring Spotlight
## 
### 
Turbans are tops this spring. Not
the turbans of last summer, careless
and slung-together looking, but in
tricately draped and beautifully tied
turbans.
Made of straw or silk, turbans are
perfect with afternoon dresses, espe
cially if they are trimmed with a
flower, either artificial or fresh. Vel
vet and lame turbans give an exotic
touch to sophisticated evening
dresses, and many silk jersey formals
have their own matching turbans.
Turbans are even used with more
informal clothes. One manufacturer
has what he calls a "turbaned suit"
with the turban matching the blouse
of the suit. Turbans of printed and
striped cotton to match beach clothes
are life-savers for ladies with hard
to-manage hair.
