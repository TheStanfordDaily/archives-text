# Row Men Cheat Death As Creek Sinks Canoe; Boathouse Rides Flood
## Lake Lagunita Crowds Banks At 38-foot Mark 
### JACK BURTT 
More water than last year's Junior
Water Carnival publicity man ever
dreamed of piled down from Scars
ville Lake during yesterday's storm
to assure Stanford that Lake Lagu
nita will be brimful for most of
spring quarter .
And when the water level in the
lake stood at 38 feet, one foot short
of the levee top, the rest of the flood
just took a short cut around the
corner of Roble Hall, inundated Lo
mita Drive in front of ihe Daily
Shack, gorged the underground
drainage system of the whole cam
pus, and what was left ran down the
neck of every student who stepped
outside.
BOATHOUSE WON'T FLOAT
Firmly anchored, the Boathouse
seemed to be in no danger, though
sizeable white-caps, whipped up by
a strong wind, slapped around the
wooden skirting a few inches below
the floor level. Corporation Yard en
gineers, called into action at the re
quest of Student Manager Cobbs,
took steps to prevent the lake from
rising any higher.
The overflow stand-pipe, just off
shore from the Boathouse, is 36 feet
highâ€”tall enough to take care of any
ordinary flood and keep the lake at
a reasonable level. But the water
stood two feet above the top of it
yesterday. It was like bailing the
Normandie with a teaspoon.
Emergency sluice gates were
opened by the engineers, and they
guaranteed the water would rise no
higher. They even thought to cut
the gates back a little, so that all the
precious water wouldn't run out.
RAMPS POINT UP
To slickered students whose cu
riosity prompted them to go to the
the Boathouse for a first-hand view,
the whole picture was just too ironic.
Where last year the wooden canoe
ramps slopped downward at a steep
angle into a measly puddle of a lake,
today they sloped upward, and so
steeply that they threatened to pry
themselves off the boat deck.
The emergency gates were opened
just before the water had raised the
ramps enough to tear the boards oil
at the juncture of the ramps with the
deck.
Meantime, the remainder of the
campus ran like a river. A portable
pump was placed in service in front
of the Bookstore to empty an over
taxed drain. Sand-bags were piled
in front of a man-hole by the Press
Building to keep the water that
flooded the street out of the steam
pipes.
BRIDGE TOO LOW
The creek on the east .side of Roble
ran over, not under, the bridge.
Nearly every corner had a stand of
water sufficient for deep wading.
But with floods choking every
creek on the Peninsula, and large
parts of Redwood City under water,
the Farm's drains appeared to be
doing a commendable, if inadequate,
job.
In the 24 hours of the storm from
Monday night until the calm at 3
o'clojck yesterday afternoon, 2.22
inches of rain had deluged the Farm.
The season's total rose to 16.56
inches, as compared with last year's
dry 8.4. The 30-year average is
11.65.
And with flood and storm warn
ings out from Washington to South
ern California, the San Francisco
Weather Bureau predicts more rain
today.
