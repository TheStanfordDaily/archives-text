# College Girls Disguise Their Dorm Rooms
## 
### 
It's axiomatic that youi college
room will reflect your personality.
If it's neat and well-ordered, it
will reflect an ordered college lile
with time foi leisure and lime for
play, say our advisors. More im
portant than that, however, is, as
they used to say in the old melo
dramas, that it b(> a cheerful, gay
place to come back to alter a busy
day.
Outstanding among rooms which
answer this requirement is that of a
certain Robleite. It resembles
nothfhg more than one of the semi
tropical living rooms currently lec
tured in "smart" magazines.
DESK SUBSTITITF
She has substituted for the regu
lar dorm desk a long, low desk cov
ered with a straw fabric with a pol
ished lightwood top. Light green
grass matting covers the floor.
A royal blue duck cover and
huge, blu-c; duck covered pillows
with white tufted borders turn the
bed into a modernistic couch. She
cleverly camouflages a small trunk
by transforming it, with the aid of
more blue duck and white tufting,
into an ottoman.
The curtains arc thin red, white
and blue striped material with a
cream background and edged with
royal blue denim to match the
couch, 'il.e Robleite can always
count on cries of amazement when
she admits that the curtains are of
the same material of which race
horseblankets are made.
A white radio, on another small
table, her own sketches in bamboo
frames, and a flat blue bowl with
white flowers, floating in it make this
room a thoroughly enjoyable place
for work or relaxation. And the
total cost for this room was very
reasonable.
STANFORD BUT FEMININE
Other clever rooms observed
throughout the dormitory deserve
mention; one in red and white shows
school spirit and yet retains the
feminine touch, another features
pale yellow, white, and light woods,
and another room has an early
American theme with a huge wing
arm chair, tufted lamp shades, all
using shades of blue.
Numerous novelties and well
loved gadgets add touches of gaiety
to rooms all over the campus. Cur
rently enjoying a big run are white
pottery heads, with little grooves in
the skulls. The grooves are planted
with grass seed, the head is filled
with water, and almost immediately
there is a touch of spring-like green
in your room.
