USES LEAP YEAII TIIEME
The program announced that this
was a spring fashion show with a
leap year theme. Be that as it may,
the outstanding style notes seemed
to be these:
1. Anything at all may be called
a hat and perched on the head,
but it's apt to be somewhat reminis
cent of kitchen equipment and is
pretty likely to be adorned with
yards and yards of veil, possibly em
broidered. There seems, however, to
be a certain trend toward larger,
even Merry Widow, brims, the most
becoming of all possible headgear,
2. The rumors we heard about
more formal beach and sports clothes
are being substantiated.
3. Chartreuse again is very, very
good, and all the pastels are popular.
4. Navy blue is the best of all.

I If you re going to have new furs i
this season, they just about have to
be silver fox.
G. More and more formats are 1
showing up with those useful hoods i
and pockets attached, and a good
deal of beaded embroidery is going '
■ to parties along with them.
Being more specific, these are a;
few of the stand-outs picked at
j random fiom among the more than j
sixty outfits:
White tailored slacks with a cun-'
nil it-; little quilted jacket and a large
j blue hat, the whole thing accented!
| with bright red.
A floor length wrap-around skirt
in bright yellow worn over shorts
I and with a halter of the same ma
terial.
A very short multi-colored skirt
::nJ chartreuse blouse worn with a
ti vmendous natural straw brim that, I
| lacking a crown altogether, can't
! really be called a hat.
DRESSY SPORTS WEAR
Getting into the more dressy sports
; wear, a bright blue and white print
| with a short silk jacket of the same
bright blue is worthy of mention.
'I he jacket shoulders well padded,
and the hat a sporty white sailor
; with, of all things, a bright green
; scarf attached.
A skirt-length many-colored plaid
cape worn over a light blue dress.
Coming around to more dressy
afternoon clothes, a black crepe
| tucked from neck to hem and ac
cented with bright red accessories.
A steel grey dressy coat, fitted
tight at the waist and flaring at the
j hem, with a gorgeous blue fox col
-1 lax*.

I SILVER FOX GLAMOROUS
A glamorous silver fox jacket,
j waist length, with an intriguing
, round-and-round treatment of the
i fur in the sleeves.
To lead oft' the formal group, a
simple straw-yellow organdy worn
J with a wide-brimmed natural straw
i hat tied under the chin with a bright
i green scarf.
A chartreuse georgette skirt with
the blouse and large pockets of
j starched lace in the same shade.
I And finally the Brown twins in
i net, one lavender and the other deep
I rose, with lovely orchid corsages.
BRIDES PARADE
To round out the show came the
| traditional parade of brides, this time
j leap year brides for the years 11)04,
, 1912, 1920, 1928, and 1940. The crowd
| roared at the ladies of yesterday,
I especially the white satin gown of
| 1928, chopped off at the knees in
j front and extending out back into
three or four yards of train.
SPRING WEDDING
1940's bridal party was dressed in
| a most unusual but entirely lovely
■ spring theme. The four bridesmaids
I were in net skirts of rainbow hue
j and cream colored blouses.
Two carried dep blue hyacinths
! and th eother two carried the same
i flowers in deep rose. Their hats had
I wide transparent brims and long
! streamers to match the bouquets.
The maid of honor was dressed
| entirely in the cream colored net
| and carried yellow hyacinths. The
1 streamers on her hat and -bouquet
were of bright green.
The lovely bride herself, Jane
Jackson, Cal's Sweetheart of Sig

ma Chi last year, was dressed in
the traditional garb of brides, white
satin. The gown was made with a
very full skirt and leg-o-mutton
sleeves, and her bouquet was, of all
things, of white tulips. But the ef
fect was wonderful.
