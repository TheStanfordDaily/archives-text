# Accessories Don't Match This Season
## Multi-Colored Outfit To Depend on Basic Beige, Gray Themes 
### 
When the rain and fog clear away,
thought. l ' of the Staniord woman
will turn to springâ€”and clothes.
Alter choosing ji.st the right spoils
dress and finally deciding on her
spring dress foi the City, she'll pon
der the problem of what accessories
to wear with them.
And this year shoes, purse, hat
and gloves will definitely not match.
The day of two-color costumes has
been gone for some time. They
should be ;i pleasing contrast, cer
tainly, but not monotonous. Beige
and gray will be the two basic col
ors for many costumes. With beige
will be worn darker tans and brown,
not the deed brown of a few years
ago and yet not rust.
(iRAY COMPLIMENTS MANY
Gray will be combined with navy
blue, always a popular spring color.
And black will be worn only as a
trimming for white. The old orchict
and French blues are out, they have
taken on an icy tone and are softer.
The new blues stand up especially
well under artificial lighting.
After the color problem has been
solved, it will be a question of what
kind of a hat or shoes or purse to
get. Hats are not as silly and ab
surd as they were last spring, but
they are definitely frivolous.
STRAWS BRIMMED. VEILED
Straw is still the popular spring
materiel with beige, burnt sugar,
and navy blue the leading colors.
The straws nearly all are trimmed
with fluffy veils, usually twined
around the brim or crown, and fall
ing down on the shoulders. Others
may be trimmed with clusters of
berries and an occasional bird in the
pre-war style.
Bonnets are sharing equal honors
with the sailor variations, another
sign ol the end ot the glamor styles.
Another style can't really be classi
fied; they are just a bunch of flow
ers at the front of the head, fas
tened by a ribbon in back.
PATENT IS CIIIC
Shoes this year welcome the re
turn of patent leather, which most
ol us haven't worn since we out
grew Mary Janes. Black patent will
give that finishing touch to many
costumes, where it used to be con
sidered too flashy for good taste.
The round moccasin toes look par
ticularly well in patent. Alligator
is anothei popular trimming, espe
cially wills suede and doeskin.
Purses are huge again, often
large gathered suede pouches that
are bulky but practical. Soft leather
is often used, with patent leather
appearing here too.
