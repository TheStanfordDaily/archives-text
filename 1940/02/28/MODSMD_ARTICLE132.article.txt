# Colorful Gloves Provide Accent
## 
### 
Gloves, like all other accessories,
are extremely important as a color
note this spring. They come in ev
ery conceivable shade of every color,
from fire-engine red for your mili
tary blue suit to thick pink for warm
weather dresses, from glowing Pa
cific blue to misty hydrangea blue.
Gloves can either match your en
semble or contrast with it this spring.
Manufacturers of different accesso
ries have formed a "color combina
tion." That is, you may now get hats
and shoes to match, purses and
gloves, hats and gloves, or any other
combination which does the most
for your costume.
Mittens are being shown by some
novelty shops. These come as a hold
over, no doubt, from the heavy yarn
and angora mitts worn last season.
This spring's mittens come in doe
skin and other light-weight leathers
in colors to go with your pastel
dresses.
