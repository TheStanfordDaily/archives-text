# Milady Chooses Spring Make-up In Natural Red
## 
### 
Cosmetics have become practical.
No move unhealthy purples and or
anges, no more dead-white powder.
Make-up is natural but far from pale
this year.
And besides that, cosmetologists
.ire beginning to realize what iheir
customers have to go through \o
enoose the right shades from die
many offered them. So most of the
leading houses are showing matched
make -up — foundation, powder,
roir.'.e, lipstick all keyed to the same
shades.
One of the most becoming new
colors for wear with those spring
pastels appearing on the Quad is
Watermelon, a deep reddish pink the
exact shade of the heart of a water
melon.
KNOCKOUT Mil)
And the same company thai pro
duced it has a week-old wonder "or
brunettes who like clear red shades.
It's called Knockout Red, and the
i ntire set, lipstick, rouge, foundation,
an 3 powder, comes in a little bDx
shaped like the bell at the side of a
prize ring. It's a knockout!
Now that spring is here, and pco-
I le are getting tired of heavy Orien
tal perfumes, try the new cologne
named Essence Conversation. It
smells heavenly, and has an oil base
that makes it last forever.
BURBLE-BATHS LUXURIOUS
With a new pink-and-white com
plexion, a girl can't afford to have
the effect spoiled by blackheads, so
give a thought to the herbal meal
made by a well-known cosmetolo
gist. It is solt and fine as powder,
and just as smoothing to the skin.
Because of its extra mildness, it
doesn't work wonders overnight, but
with steady treatment, it's guaran
teed to leave the skin clear.
When completely renovated for
spring, and in need of that final
touch of luxury before a date, try
the new colored bubble bath. It
comes in shades of green, pink, blue,
and yellow, scented wilh natural
cologne that smells marvelous at the
time, but disappears so that it won't
conflict with the perfume one is
wearing.
COMPACTS WHIMSICAL
And speaking of the perfume,
watch for the scent called Confetti.
It isn't available at local stores yet,
but advance reports predict that it
will be as gala as it sounds.
And for the final touch of whimsy
that spring seems to require, carry
one" of those gold compacts shaped
like a mask with wickedly slanting
black eyes. It's so different that
even "dates" won't mind carrying it
in a pocket.

And the same company thai pro
duced it has a week-old wonder "or
brunettes who like clear red shades.
It's called Knockout Red, and the
i ntire set, lipstick, rouge, foundation,
an 3 powder, comes in a little bDx
shaped like the bell at the side of a
prize ring. It's a knockout!
Now that spring is here, and pco-
I le are getting tired of heavy Orien
tal perfumes, try the new cologne
named Essence Conversation. It
smells heavenly, and has an oil base
that makes it last forever.
BURBLE-BATHS LUXURIOUS
With a new pink-and-white com
plexion, a girl can't afford to have
the effect spoiled by blackheads, so
give a thought to the herbal meal
made by a well-known cosmetolo
gist. It is solt and fine as powder,
and just as smoothing to the skin.
Because of its extra mildness, it
doesn't work wonders overnight, but
with steady treatment, it's guaran
teed to leave the skin clear.
When completely renovated for
spring, and in need of that final
touch of luxury before a date, try
the new colored bubble bath. It
comes in shades of green, pink, blue,
and yellow, scented wilh natural
cologne that smells marvelous at the
time, but disappears so that it won't
conflict with the perfume one is
wearing.
COMPACTS WHIMSICAL
And speaking of the perfume,
watch for the scent called Confetti.
It isn't available at local stores yet,
but advance reports predict that it
will be as gala as it sounds.
And for the final touch of whimsy
that spring seems to require, carry
one" of those gold compacts shaped
like a mask with wickedly slanting
black eyes. It's so different that
even "dates" won't mind carrying it
in a pocket.
Cosmetics have become practical.
No move unhealthy purples and or
anges, no more dead-white powder.
Make-up is natural but far from pale
this year.
And besides that, cosmetologists
.ire beginning to realize what iheir
customers have to go through \o
enoose the right shades from die
many offered them. So most of the
leading houses are showing matched
make -up — foundation, powder,
roir.'.e, lipstick all keyed to the same
shades.
One of the most becoming new
colors for wear with those spring
pastels appearing on the Quad is
Watermelon, a deep reddish pink the
exact shade of the heart of a water
melon.
