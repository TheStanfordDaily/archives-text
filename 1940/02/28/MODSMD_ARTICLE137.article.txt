# Food Leaves Kitchen For Fabric Market
## 
### 
With various wars making im- l
ported fabrics prohibitive in price,
manufacturers are developing new
synthetic fabrics to take their place.
A substitute for wool has been i
made from meat, and spun glass has
been found to provide an exciting
material for evening dresses. Corn,;
wheat, and milk have been experi- i
rnented with. and the resulting fab- 1
rics will soon be on the market. |
