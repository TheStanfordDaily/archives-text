# TAFFETA CHECKS AND VELVET BOWS FOR SPRING IN 1940
## 
### 

JANICE BRADBURY, '43, settles down into yards of black and white checked taffeta that make this formal
from Livingston's. The dress has black velvet trimming on the square neckline and its new pinafore pockets.
Mademoiselle specifies that this dinner dress of swishy rayon taffeta with velvet on the basque bodice and
peiked-up sleeves be worn by the impâ€”"a gamin of a girl." The impish style is less Competition for the fradi
ditional diaphanous skirts of marquisette and old organdy than a variation of the girl graduate theme.
