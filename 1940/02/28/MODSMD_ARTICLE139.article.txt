# Chiffon Scarfs Appear in New Pastel Shades
## 
### 
And then, of course, there are
scarfs—those square silk or cotton
or chiffon things that people wear to
early breakfast because they didn't
have time to comb their hair or tie
around their neck so they will have
something to match their bobbie
socks. Only this spring they are all
chiffon. No silk and no cotton.
Most of them are plain, but occa
sionally a print appears just to be
different.
When they are plain, they are in
muted tones- dusty pink, beige, moss
green, and lots of other shades with
manufactured names.
Ihe prints come in enough flowers
to give a botanist a nervous break
down—they just miss looking like
something we've seen somewhere
before. If not flowers, then plaids.
And the plaids are pastel to accom
pany new spring dresses.
