# Storms Pound State Coast In Fourth Day
## Olson May Summon Legislators to Act In Flood Emergency 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 27 (UP)
—Record-breaking rainstorms to
day pounded Northern California
for the fourth consecutive day,
threatening a repetition of the
1937 flood disasters.
Hundreds of families moved out
of flooded farmlands and scores of
persons were marooned by the
rising waters. Highways and rail
roads were under water. No loss
of life was reported, but crop and
property damage mounted hourly.
The storm struck from the Te
hachapi Mounltains near Bakersfield
north to the Oregon line, and ranged
from the coast to the Sierra Ne
vadas. It was expected to spread
into Southern California.
MORE RAIN FORECAST
The downpour was expected 1o
continue at least until tomorrow
night. Many areas had six inches of
rain in 24-hour periods. Small craft
storm warnings were up along the
coast.
Flood conditions were serious in
the upper Sacramento Valley, with
homes evacuated and persons ma
rooned at Redding, Colusa, Gerber,
Tehama, Red Bluff and other points.
A cloudburst thundered down the
San Lorenzo Valley in the Santa
Cruz area, pouring 8.75 inches on
Boulder Creek within 17 hours. In
Marin County, the Waldo approach
to the Golden Gate Bridge was par
tially blocked, .small craft were torn
from moorings, and schools closed
because of flooded highways.
RESCUED BY BOAT
Pescadero was under water, six
feet deep in places, and 15 families
were rescued by rowboats. Bayshorc
Highway was partially blocked.
The U.S. Weather Bureau said a
new storm was brewing 700 miles
west of Eureka and was moving to
ward the coast. Its greatest; force
was expected to hit Oregon and
Washington. It was described as a
huge counterclockwise motion of air,
the outer fringes of which set, up
strong southerly winds that at times
reached gale force along the coast.
The old storm had spent itself and
was passing inland over Wyoming.
LEGISLATURE MAY MEET
Meanwhile state officials consid
ered reconvening the legislature for
emergency action. The legislature
recessed only last Sunday and may
lie reconvened on three days' notice.
But if the emergency i.s held not to
be within the scope of the legislative
call, it would be necessary for Gov
ernor Culbert, L. Clson to issue a
new or supplementary call.
Southern Pacific rerouted trains
and passengers at three points in
Northern California —on the San
Francisco-Portland main line, on
the San Francisco-Sacramento line,
and on the San Jose-Santa Cruz line,
all blocked by slides and washouts.
