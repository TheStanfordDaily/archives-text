vide lor the women in her audience
an example of true Parisian chic.

women in Paris.
Schiaparelli makes all of Mile.
Curie's daytime costumes, Suzy de
» ign.s her hats, and Chanel her
evening clothes. However, Mile.
Curie marvels at American ready
made clothes; in Paris, she explains,
it is not possible to buy fine dresses
ready to wear. One must order them
made, and consequently endure many
tedious fittings.
LIKES OUR PLAY CLOTIIES
Mile. Curie particularly likes
American sports clothes — slacks,
cotton dresses, and bathing suits.
She admits that even Paris, the
world's fashion capital, cannot excel
American designers in the creation
of sports apparel.
Hie special wardrobe assembled
for her current lecture tour includes
several of the new navy dresses for
both day-time and evening wear.
Her dinner dresses for lecturing are
severely simple: high necks and long j
sleeves achieve the covered-up look.
WEARS SUITS OFTEN
Mile. Curie wears suits a great
deal, both in wool and in silk, and I
accents them with colored blouses. '
She also has a great fondness for J
that pet of French women—the "lit - |
tie black frock," that can be worn i
'round the clock. With these she !
seldom wears ornaments other than I
fin occasional striped bow.
She has simplified the millinery |
problem by wearing one style almost
exclusively—the pillbox. With these
she wears detachable snoods. She
has a number of them in various
colors and fabrics.
FASHION CREDO
Notes from Eve Curie's fashion
credo:
"I always wear black and white or
navy blue—never striking clothes.
If you do not have many clothes they
must not be striking."
She does not like jewelry or gadg
ets—she feels that they attract at
tention away from her face and in
terfere with the lines of her gown.
She usually has a pel dress. The
current one is a restaurant dress,
which she describes as "slender and
dark." It has a little jacket ol the
same material with embroidery on
the shoulders and sleeves. Schiapa
relli designed it.
SCHIAPARELLI COAT
Outstanding in her present ward
vobc is a Sehiaparelli-designed black
oil-skin coat lined with flufTy lamb's
wool and equipped with huge pock
ets.
Mile. Curie wears her red-brown
hair in a pompadour style, reminis
cent of the coiffures worn tit the time
that her mother was a young woman.
Parted across the head from ear to
ear, the back hair is cropped like a
little boy's and swirled slightly to
one side. The front is drawn up into
a waved pompadour on each side of
a center part.

FASHION CREDO
Notes from Eve Curie's fashion
credo:
"I always wear black and white or
navy blue—never striking clothes.
If you do not have many clothes they
must not be striking."
She does not like jewelry or gadg
ets—she feels that they attract at
tention away from her face and in
terfere with the lines of her gown.
She usually has a pel dress. The
current one is a restaurant dress,
which she describes as "slender and
dark." It has a little jacket ol the
same material with embroidery on
the shoulders and sleeves. Schiapa
relli designed it.
SCHIAPARELLI COAT
Outstanding in her present ward
vobc is a Sehiaparelli-designed black
oil-skin coat lined with flufTy lamb's
wool and equipped with huge pock
ets.
Mile. Curie wears her red-brown
hair in a pompadour style, reminis
cent of the coiffures worn tit the time
that her mother was a young woman.
Parted across the head from ear to
ear, the back hair is cropped like a
little boy's and swirled slightly to
one side. The front is drawn up into
a waved pompadour on each side of
a center part.
Although she comes here as a lec
turer next, week. Eve Curie will pro

Her perfect mannequin's figure and

ment as one of the ten best-dressed
women in Paris.

made clothes; in Paris, she explains,
it is not possible to buy fine dresses
ready to wear. One must order them
made, and consequently endure many
tedious fittings.
LIKES OUR PLAY CLOTIIES

American sports clothes — slacks,

She admits that even Paris, the
