# Printed Silk Jersey Favored For Informal Date Dresses
## 
### 
"Gone With the Wind" lias influenced more than the moviegoers' ac
cents—it has invaded the field of college fashions by bringing wasp waist
lines, full skirls, and extended shoulder lines.
Full skirts feature impressed pleats, gores, flares, and combinations of
pleats and gores. A few novelty jeweled belts are seen, but, as a rule,

waist lines are undecorated to
that "sixteen inch" appearance.
In the crepe dresses, horizontal I
midriff tucking aids the narrowing
influences. Skirts remain the same
length or a little shorter.
Pockets are the main ornamenta- j
tion. Wide pockets, patch pockets, j
inset, slit pockets, false pockets add |
character and decoration to the
dresses.
The new silk jersey in printed de- (
signs and plain pastels is the most |
popular fabric, although a few crepe j
dresses are seen. Small prints, wild j
splashes of color, on black or navy
blue backgrounds run a close second
in popularity to the conventional
navy, black, and gray. The navy
blue and black numbers are livened
by the "lingerie trim"—small touches
ot lace and eyelet embroidery at (lie
neck-line and on (he pockets.
For very early spring wear, jac
ket. ensembles are shown. These
consist of plain blue or black skirts
wi!h printed tops and a bolero or
coat which is lined with the same
print.
Sleeves are short, or three quarter
length and in the usual extended
shoulder style. Necklines are high,
featuring more costume jewelry.
Draped cowl and V necks are also
popular.
Matching or contrasting turbans
cither in print or plain complete the
outfits. Small black or white straws
give that finished ''chic" appear
ance.
