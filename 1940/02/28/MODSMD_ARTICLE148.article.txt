# Lace Comes Back In Cloves, Blouses
## 
### 
Lace is coming back! In fluffy
blouses, dress trimming, formal eve
ning gowns and even gloves one
finds this typically feminine mate
rial.
Camouflage is evident in the
blouses with the body of Ihe gar
ment being of baptiste, the front
garnished with lace trimming so
that milady's suit reveals a charm
ing, sheer bit of fluff. Latest in
evening gowns is white lace over a
black slip, which sounds ghastly but
greates a quite chic effect.
