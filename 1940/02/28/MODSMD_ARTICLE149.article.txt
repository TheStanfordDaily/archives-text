# Plaster-White Silk Comes in Tiers
## 
### 
A dinner costume in tiers is the
one of the newest and smartest pos
sible. A spring dress of plaster
white silk crepe, tiers of tucks for
the bodice, tiers of fringe flowing
irom a low hip-line, topped by a
matching turban strikingly com
mands attention.
For trim many strands of heavy
pearls, a heavy bracelet, and huge
ornament on the turban complete
this altogether different costume.

Isabelle of Bavaria in the 15th cen
tury wore such high head-dresses
that the doorways of her castle were
raised to accommodate her.
