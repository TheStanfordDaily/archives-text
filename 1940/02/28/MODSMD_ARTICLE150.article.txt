that could be the origin of feminine
trinkets and gadgets for this spring j
season.
Wood, gold, lhinestones, nickel, |
hammered copper, leather, cro- ,
cheted wool. Little figures of ani
mals, a pair of wooden shoes, the |
Cross of the Legion of Honor repro- |
duced in blue, white and red jewels. |
There is literally no end to the in- j
ventiveness and diversity behind the ;
manufacture of the tiny objects used
as ornaments and accessories to
women's costumes.
Most of the fad-gadgets start as j
imported favors, found in foreign
shops. Then, when the novelty mak
trs realize that a trend is set, they ■
undertake to reproduce the articles !
and devise variations of their own.
FOREIGN FADS
An example, cited by a specialist
in this line, is the popularity of j
Swedish costumes and their acees- |
sories: the dirndl, the knitted "ba- j
boushka" cap, that heavy ivory lace
work, the coarse wool embroidery,:
the small wood and leather lapel ;
trinkets. The influx of ski fashions |
had contributed to this general fad, j
under the title of '"Tyrolean" fash- i
ions. And with the sentiment toward |
Czechoslovakia and Finland during 1
the last year, the style is definitely ;
established.
This last summer saw sponsored a !
drive to buy Chinese costume jew- ;
elry and even old gold, lapis lazuli, 1
and jade ornaments of twisted
beauty.
SOUTII OF TIIE BORDER
Recently the shops from Maine to ]
Washington and points south were
flooded with huaraches from Mexico,

and later from New Jersey. The J
heavy silver concha belts, which will
probably never become completely
nationwide because of their price,
aie nothing more than the'silver—
or copper—conchas from the saddles
of the Mexican "charros," strung to
gether by silver links.
The narrow serape belt which ties
to let its ends fall halfway to the,
hemline is another importation from
south of the border, as is the natural
silk "charro" shirt with its nation
alistic embroidery.
The war has been responsible for
many new gadgets, some of them
very lovely, others strictly masculine
in style.
MILITARY INFLUENCE
For a while there were bullion
epaulets, worn on the shoulders of
tailored suits to give the military
touch. Some designers added a Sam
Browne belt. All costumes for spring
stress buttons—big, shiny, engraved
ones, with all the crests and mottoes
of regiments that can be reproduced.
The latest novelties, however, are
the facsmilos of decoration? for he
roism. The Cross of the Legion of
Honor has appeared in large clear
jewels, with a small guard crest of
some anonymous British regiment.
The Croix de Guerre has been repro
duced with the needed changes, as
have the more elaborate orders
which range anywhere from one and
a half to three inches in diameter,
and are worn o, 1 . the shoulder of
formal and very simple dresses alike.
But some could not afford the
lhinestones or crystal reproductions
and have compromised on bars of
red, blue, white, and green ribbons
to set off their shoulder-lines.

An example, cited by a specialist

Swedish costumes and their acees- |
sories: the dirndl, the knitted "ba- j
boushka" cap, that heavy ivory lace
work, the coarse wool embroidery,:
the small wood and leather lapel ;
trinkets. The influx of ski fashions |
had contributed to this general fad, j
under the title of '"Tyrolean" fash- i

Czechoslovakia and Finland during 1
the last year, the style is definitely ;
established.
