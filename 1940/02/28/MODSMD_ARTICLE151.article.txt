# Lapels in Limelight
## 
### 
Fantastic metal flowers will bloom
on the lapels of the new suits this
spring, as fashion forsakes the comic
leather figures of former seasons for
gleaming rhinestone and enamel
floral sprays. Brilliant tropical fish
will be the motif for many other
designs.
Silver seems to be the preferred
color, but solid silver figures are rare.
One of the loveliest consists of a
number of family crests dangling
from two silver cutlasses.
Stones are usually blue or red,
with variegated colors running a
close second. Moonstones are popu
lar, as well as glazed pottery. White
pique flowers are often worn in
preference to the imitation ones of
last spring.
TWIN LAPEL PINS
Some pins come in sets that can
Ije attached to' opposite lapels, or
one underneath the other on the
same side. These are commonly pen
guins, animals, or chessmen of
enamel and rhinestone.
One of the trickier new animal
pins utilizes the "cat and canary"
theme. Clarabell the Cow and a
stiff-legged colt with a wire mane
are now being reproduced in pot
tery. Punch and Judy and several
comic heads also appear in the same
material.
In the main, glazed pottery is be
ing used to make the realistic flower
pins of California poppies, wood vio
lets, and lady slipper orchids in life
like colors. Pottery is also used for
figures from the Southwest—cactus,
burros, and Mexican characters.
One pin in a Palo Alto shop is
made with white enamel leaves and

| tiriy blue lilies-of-the-vallcy dan
gling from the stern. One of the
rhinestone ornaments consists of two
1 flowers and a bud of blue glass set
in a gold background.
The trend toward gracefulness is
| carried further by twinkling rhine
! stone feathers and plumes. Tiny
i silver hands hold flower bouquets.
Pique flowers come in all varieties
! —daisies, lilies, carnations, violets,
| and even cherries—chiefly in white.
| Tight little imitation nosegays are
also popular, as weil as small bunches
of realistic fruit.
In the oddity class may be listed
black and white leather flowers, vel-»
vet leaves, and most original of all—
! the feather puffs like the ones worn
i on hats for the last year or so.
