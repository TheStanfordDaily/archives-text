# Anything Is Jewelry
## 
### 
; Militaristic influences arc appar
i ent in jewelry as well as in every
| other field of women's fashions this
j spring. And red, white, and blue
| are the predominant colors,
i Carved wooden ornaments are
| still popular for lapels and neck
| lines, and metal is also Rood. Every
thing imaginable serves as decora
j tion. Horrible, painted pirate heads;
; Zulu medicine men with great, gold
i rings in their noses; shining metal
\ skis, and silver ice skates.
For the dresses and sweaters that
so often require some finishing toiuh
; of chic, the choker type necklace
j comes in every possible color, ma
| terial, and design. Real shells and
nuts make novel necklaces, and
I gaudy celluloid bangles in bright
I colors are light weight and striking
! in effect.
Wear a garland of clear-white

posies at the neck, a bunch of trans
parent, iridescent baubles, a necklace
of plaster white and gilt bugles, or
just a chain of multi-colored daisies.
Anything goes, or if it hasn't yet
been manufactured, it soon will be.
