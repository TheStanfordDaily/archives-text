# Firemen, Police Save Phi Sigs From Drowning
## 
### 
Al Zadig and Walter Fairwcather,
members of Phi Sigma Kappa, nar
rowly escaped drowning in swollen
San Francisquito Creek yesterday
afternoon, when a canoe in which
> they were attempting to "shoot the
| rapids" overturned in midstream.
Ed Rogers, who participated in
| the rescue, and Zadig were confined
j to the Palo Alto Hospital last night
j for treatment for exhaustion and
exposure as a result of the accident.
| It was not known whether they
would be sufficiently recovered to bo
{ released today.
The creek, normally a mild stream
no more than 10 to L r > feet wide, has
become a swift, rough river within
the last two days due to the heavy
rains, and is now al least 80 feet wide
and from 5 to 10 feet deep.
ESCAPE MIRACULOUS
Fred Frehe, University officer,
commented that he thought their es
cape "miraculous."
Two others who stood in the frigid
river for half an hour while Zadig's
rescue was accomplished were ap
parently uninjured by their immer
sion. They were Rex Shoop, also a
Phi Sig, and Arden Hatley, a captain
in the Stanford Fire Department.
At least 15 members of the Uni
| versity and Palo Alto police and fire
departments participated in the res
cue at 4:30 o'clock yesterday. Sev
eral spectators were pressed into
service to hold the life lines against
the swift water.
PLAN TO RUN RAPIDS
Fairwcather, Zadig, Rodgers, and
Shoop conceived the idea of .shoot
ing down the flooded creek. They
took the Phi Sig canoe from the
Boathouse, lowered it into the creek
just below the bridge at the fourth
tee, and two of them pushed off
in it.
They managed to stay upright for
about 25 yards, but the tremendous
head of water in the creek was too
much for them and their canoe
spilled them out. Fairweather was
washed into quiet water a short dis
tance below the scene of the acci
dent, and was recued by Hatley
who waded in after him.
Zadig was swopt downstream about
I . r )0 yards, finally hanging up on a
j tree in midstream. From that point,
j his fraternity brothers, and police
j and firemen, rescued him by means
I of two long life lines stretched from
shore.
RESCUERS SUFFER COLD
Rodgers, Shoop, and Hatley strip
ped and plunged into the stream t/>
fasten the lines to trees. They re
mained in the stream until Zadig
was rescued, and were then pulled
to shore one at a time. All three
were suffering severely from cold
and exhaustion.
The canoe was swept under the
rapids and > was not found after the
i accident, according to reports re
ceived at the Boathouse. It. was be
; lieved to be a total loss.
