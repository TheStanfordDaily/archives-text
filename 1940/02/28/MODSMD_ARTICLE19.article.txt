## Welles Mission Faces Dark Future As France Echoes British Feeling 
### United Press 
The dove of peace, which harassed neutral nations have heen seeking
(o discover in the silk hat of President Roosevelt's personal observer of
the European scene. Stunner Welles, appeared today to have retreated
hcyond the eye of man.
Talk of peace—a peace which would end the Russo-Einnish conflict as
a preliminary to a negotiated settlement of the full dress Allied-German

v/ar continued, but it seemed to be,
1;ilk and nothing more.
The worst blow to the "peace of
fensive," which many Europeans
have seen in the Welles mission and
the simultaneous accrediting of My
ron C. Taylor as President Roose
velt's special envoy to the Vatican,
was a scathing address Tuesday by
Britain's choleric F'irst Lord of the
Admiralty, Winston Churchill, who
again warned Europe's hard-pressed
neutrals that, they should support the
Allies, threatened Germany with a
vastly strengthened British Navy,
and again indicated Britain's deter
mination to see through the war to
a knockout victory.
FRENCH SUSPICIOUS
French informants, who have been
suspicious of the Welles mission ever
since it was announced, echoed the
Churchill sentiments and again re
called the Saturday speech of Brit
ish Prime Minister Neville Cham
berlain announcing the Allies' deter
mination to win a clear-cut victory.
The Churchill speech presumably
was timed to carry a new warning
to the world and Germany in advance
ol Welles' arrival in Berlin Friday
for conversations with Adolf Hitler
and Foreign Minister Joachim von
Ribbentrop.
The Under Secreatry stuck to his
previously announced intention to
say nothing and withhold all infor

He did reveal at a press confer

Mussolini again when he returns
to Rome from his swing through
Germany, Britain and France.
Asked il he had been consulted
about the unexpected communique
on his conversation with Mussolini,
which was released by the Italian
government Monday night, Welles
answered, somewhat shortly: "No.
The communique was drawn up and
put out entirely without my knowl
edge."
Welles said he expects to leave
Zurich for Berlin Thursday morning
and to arrive in the German capital
Friday morning. The letter from
President Roosevelt which he pre
sented Mussolini, he said, was merely
a letter of introduction containing
greetings from the President to II
Duce.

The worst blow to the "peace of
fensive," which many Europeans
have seen in the Welles mission and
the simultaneous accrediting of My
ron C. Taylor as President Roose
velt's special envoy to the Vatican,
was a scathing address Tuesday by
Britain's choleric F'irst Lord of the
Admiralty, Winston Churchill, who
again warned Europe's hard-pressed
neutrals that, they should support the
Allies, threatened Germany with a
vastly strengthened British Navy,
and again indicated Britain's deter
mination to see through the war to
a knockout victory.

The communique was drawn up and
put out entirely without my knowl
edge."
Welles said he expects to leave
Zurich for Berlin Thursday morning
and to arrive in the German capital
Friday morning. The letter from
President Roosevelt which he pre
sented Mussolini, he said, was merely
a letter of introduction containing
greetings from the President to II
