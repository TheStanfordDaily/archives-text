This was the action members of
Ex Committee took last night, but
they didn't pass the motion until a
half hour after the meeting was over
and they had gone home.
Selection of one of the two can

typographical or involved omitted
words and misplaced paragraphs.
John Porter, new graduate man on

Wilson Cannon and Dwight Hutch
inson are the newly-appointecl joint
editors of next fall's Frosh Hand
book and Constitution.
This was the action members of
Ex Committee took last night, but
they didn't pass the motion until a
half hour after the meeting was over
and they had gone home.
Selection of one of the two can
didates was to have been made last
week, but the committee decided to
ask them if they would collabo
rate. Last night, the matter was
omitted from the agenda on the as
sumption Cannon and Hutchinson's
acceptance was sufficient.
TELEPHONE VOTE TAKEN
A telephone vote after the meet
ing last night made official the ap
pointment of the joint editors.
Numerous minor errors in this
year's printing of the constitution
were pointed out by Mary June
Montgomery and Jack Harris, who
had studied the document during the
last week. Most of the errors were
typographical or involved omitted
words and misplaced paragraphs.
John Porter, new graduate man on
Ex Committee, asked if gambling
was mentioned in the constitution.
He said some freshmen had asked
about this and that perhaps the con
stitution should be distributed more
widely by publishing it in the same
volume with the "Frosh Bible."
President Ken Cuthbertson sug
gested gambling probably is cov
ered by the "conduct unbecoming"
clause.
SEPARATE VOLUMES
Committeemen decided the two

rately for reasons of economy.
