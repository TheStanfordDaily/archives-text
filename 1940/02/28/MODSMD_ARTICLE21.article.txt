Low-rent housing and city plan

both in this country and abroad, in
the auditorium of the Education

The author of "Modern Housing,"
"Elements of English Housing Prac
tice," "Housing Progress and the
Southeast," and "Labor and the
Housing Program," Miss Bauer has
made a wide study of many angles
of the problem. She visited Europe
in 1930 and 1932 to investigate hous
ing, modern architecture, and city
planning. She was in Sweden when
the present war broke out and com
pelled her to return to this country.
Since 1934 Miss Bauer has been
executive secretary of the Labor
Housing Conference, consultant to
the PWA housing division and the
suburban resettlement division of
the Resettlement Administration. At
the present time she is director of
research and statistics for the United
States Housing Authority.
While in Europe she collaborated
with Lewis Mumford in a series of
housing articles for "Fortune," and
in 1931 she won a $1,000 prize from
"Fortune" for an essay, "Art in In
dustry," on housing in Frankfort,
Germany.
