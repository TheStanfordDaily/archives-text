MEN PROMISE WHISKERS
i Already Stanford men have prom
! ised to raise whisker crops for the
j contest. Hugh Gallarneau believes
i he can raise a longer beard than the
I rest of his football teammates. Doug
| Grant has promised to represent the
: boxers. And Blackie in the Encina
Cellar says he's going to raise a
i beard "just to show the freshmen
| how."
"But just because he doesn't want
j to enter the contest is no reason the
i every Stanford man can't raise a
j beard," concluded Alfred. "He can
start now, anil by Saturday, March 0,
when the contest ends, he can have a
swell beard. Palo Alto merchants
have donated prizes for the longest
