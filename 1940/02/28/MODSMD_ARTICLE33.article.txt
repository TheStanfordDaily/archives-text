CONFERENCE'CZAR"
GETTING SUPPORT
Ever since Jan. 4, when Edwin N.
Atherton, former G-man, had the
Commissioner of Athletics post cre
ated for him by the Pacific Coast
Conference, there hasn't been a great
deal of stir about it. Pledged sup
port for his "code' has been given
him by Stanford's Ex Committee and
Cal's student body.
Atherton welcomes these asser
tions that various groups are behind
him in his work. He is favorably im
pressed by the attitude of Stanford
alumni and officials, he says, as evi
denced by their willingness to abide
by the new rules.
GOOD FAITH RULE
GOVERNED SURVEY
Atherton was hired in January,
lfio7, to conduct a survey of the
conference's athletics. Every uni
versity promised to supply all the
information asked by Atherton and
bis aides. Good faith was the rule.
Good faith couldn't be aban
doned immediately upon the con
lerence's adoption of (he new legis
lation and the creation of the new
oflice. So it's going to he up to
all 10 conference schools to cur
tail any violations they may see
within their own individual ranks.
It can't be expected that Atherton
and his two helpers—a co-worker
and a stenographer—are going to be
able to "put the finger" only on vio
lations that they see happen. A good
share is going to have to come from
those universities which wanted this
clean-up.
lo make (he new office a go is
going (o take an awful lot of co
operation 11'om all concerned.
Whether (hey like it or not, the
institutions officials are going to
have to report their own violations.
And as violations are reporled,
penalties will be inflicted which
are going to hurt many of those
who take pride in their school's
athletics.
Yes, athletes rushed illegally will
be ineligible from any competition at
that school. If he's more serious
about a football education than an
academic one, he can move to our
alumni's rival institution.
Oh, the heartache of it all.

RECRUITING PRACTICES
WERE lIIGII-POWERED
Primarily, the new legislation is
supposed to eliminate recruiting
practices by university alumni,
coaches, and well-wishers. Ques
tionable tactics along this line were
practiced at all 10 schools, Ather
-lon's report showed.
Atherton's report criticized the
high - -powered, high - pressure
methods of recruitment. lie found
that for the most part footballers
were lined up for a certain school
almost by coercion.
In other words, the university
chose the student's institution for
him on the basis of what it could
give him in the way of financial and
other inducements. Atherton be
lieves that because of these pressure
tactics, the athlete's views of the
importance of football to a college
education were greatly distorted.
It was because it wasn't conducive
to (he training of good citizens that
Atherton favored strict regulation
of these practices.
