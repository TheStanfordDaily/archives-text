# Weather Cancels Card-Gael Game
## 
### 
Stanford's diamondmen will have
to wait a week before taking their
first crack at playing night baseball.
Tonight's scheduled game against the
St. Mary's Gaels under the arc lights
of Seals Stadium has been canceled
because of wet grounds.
The contest will be played later in
the season.
Weather permitting, the Cards will
meet Santa Clara's Broncos in a re
match Saturday on the Sunken Dia
mond. It will be the first home
league game of the season for the
local nine. Harry Wolter will shoot
Cootie Thompson back at the league
leading Broncs.

Plant spores collected on dirigible
and airplane flights over the U.S.
give government scientists informa
tion on atrial movement of plant
diseases like black stem rust of
grain.
