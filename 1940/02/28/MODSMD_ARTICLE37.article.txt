# Frosh Cagers Prep for Cubs
## Cal Games Will End Season for Papooses 
### 
Working the same five that turned
in two brilliant wins last week-end,
: Coach H. B. Lee gave his frosh bas
ketball squad a fast workout yester
day. Friday night the freshmen
travel to Berkeley to face .the Cal
; frosh and Saturday the two play here
jat 6:30 before the varsity clash. !
Big Ed Voss, high-point man last '
j week, worked at center with Caplain
| Jack Dana and little Freddie Linari j
lat the forward spots. Lihari's scin- I
I filiating floor work against Modesto
i and Lowell High ranked with Voss's i
under-the-basket play as last week's
j stand-out work.
Leo McCaffrey, a husky guard who
j usually manages to handle his share
\ of the rebounds, and little Walt Fu
! nabiki, a hustling, steady feeder, re
! tain their guard posts. The chief
j threat to this probable starting five is
I Ed Stamm, who can work at guard
! or center.
Lee plans another fast session to
l day at 2 o'clock with a light work
i out tomorrow at 4 o'clock. The two
i tilts this week end the season for
; the frosh. They have won 13 and lost
I only one so far.
