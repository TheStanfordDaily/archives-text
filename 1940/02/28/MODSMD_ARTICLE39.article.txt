# Williams Injures Knee In Practice As Varsity Drills For Final Series
## 
### 
Although it isn't exactly in the
serious stage, a knee injury ac
quired l>y Don Williams. 155-pound
Farm forward, in yesterday's prac
tice session isn't going to helo the
Indians any in their week-end
twin hill with Cal for conference
runner-up honors.
Williams, the slightly built, high
scoring Indian eager, who has been
one of the principal cogs in the Card
basketball machine, came out of a
scuffle under the basket with his
knee hurt.
He was hustled off to the B.A.C.
infirmary where he took some heat
treatment, and then reported at din
ner that it-was still stiff. It may turn
1 out to be one of those which will be
gone by Friday or else hang around
j to hamper him in his play.
WILL TEST TODAY
Coach Everett Dean will let Wil
liams test his knee this afternoon
in the Pavilion to see whether there
is anything radically wrong. It will
be the last session for the Stanfords
! before their game at Berkeley Fri
day night.
It appears rather doubtful if the
injury will put Williams completely
out of commission. However, if he
can't play his usual role in the week
! end games it will be a serious blow
I to Farm chances. All Stanford needs
j to walk off with second place behind
' U.S.C. is to split the series, and (.he
best chance to win will be in the
, Berkeley gym the opening nitht.
INDIANS TIRED
A Bear win Friday would dead
lock the teams. Then upon Satur
day's outcome would hinge the
teams' final positions.
I Tired from last week-end's fiascos
with Troy, when they split the se
ries, the Indians were given consid
erable rest Monday and yesterday.
The same program is scheduled for
today. Only shooting practice from
the floor and the foul throw line will
be in order.
Pictures of the first Stanford-Cal
t game this year, won by the locals,
55-32. will be studied at dinner to
| night by the cagers in lieu of prac
| ticing against a dummy Bear team
made up of reserves. The team had
I quite a bit taken out of them physi
' cally against Troy's rough-and-tough
cagers.
