# For Women Only

### 
IF Hattie Carnegie gives Schiaparelli some bad
moments, it's nothing to what a few Stanford
women would do to the poor expert's design
for living. Because while Hattie Carnegie may
recognize Schiaparelli's superiority come Paris
openings, Stanford women never will.
Farm women aren't that way about every
thing. They accept Graham Stuart's word on
neutrality, Dr. Guerard's views on Thomas
Mann—and some even believe what Max Fac
tor has to say about cosmetics.
But Schiaparelli has competition. And she
can't supersede that unimpeachable authority,
the Stanford woman.
She bows to herself—the girl whose Quad
clothes have been described as "classic," "dem
ocratic," and sloppy; who dresses so that San
Francisco will know she is not a Mills girl; who
at once sets the standard she is maintaining and
scrupulously maintains the standard she is set
ting.
When Schiaparelli drops a hint that Pari
siennes are wearing knapsacks because their
men are at war, Harper's and Vogue and the
Shelbyville Democrat guote it as the universal
law inviolable. To prove it, Brenda Frazier, Con
nie Bennett, and Bettye Lucik (Shelbyville) im
mediately appear in knapsacks.
Smug Stanford continues to work and play in
sweaters and skirts and black crepe cocktail
dresses.
And with all of this failure to keep up with
the times Stanford is looking younger every
day. Full little short skirts and a veto of the
sophisticated coiffure keep the reactionaries
from looking conservative even in the Welles
ley way.
And still they haven't broken faith with the
collective Stanford woman; they just let Schia
parelli go to the trouble of reviving an old style
which only supplements Stanford fashion in its
broader sense (for precedent, see Chaparral for
April, 1912).
Hoods and rubber boots, stylish this season,
were seen at Stanford. But not because they
were stylish this season. It was a rainy winter,
Stanford has no drainage system; and Peninsula
fog proves that down hair is more than a trend.
If this be rationalization, no one has uttered it
as such. These clothes were silently adopted,
and because they fitted the weather and the
women nobody thought they were very stylish.
Stanford is still "how" about traditions, espe
cially with high heels being spotted more fre
quently on Quad now that people are looking
for cigarette butts.
And as for all the fashion plates who walked
into Roble come Pre-Reg, they're still fashion
plates. But it's not Schiaparelli's fault. They
just know how to get along with tradition.—

Francisco will know she is not a Mills girl; who
at once sets the standard she is maintaining and
scrupulously maintains the standard she is set
ting.
When Schiaparelli drops a hint that Pari
siennes are wearing knapsacks because their
men are at war, Harper's and Vogue and the
Shelbyville Democrat guote it as the universal
law inviolable. To prove it, Brenda Frazier, Con
nie Bennett, and Bettye Lucik (Shelbyville) im
mediately appear in knapsacks.
Smug Stanford continues to work and play in
sweaters and skirts and black crepe cocktail
dresses.
And with all of this failure to keep up with
the times Stanford is looking younger every
day. Full little short skirts and a veto of the
sophisticated coiffure keep the reactionaries
from looking conservative even in the Welles
ley way.
And still they haven't broken faith with the
collective Stanford woman; they just let Schia
parelli go to the trouble of reviving an old style
which only supplements Stanford fashion in its
broader sense (for precedent, see Chaparral for
April, 1912).
Hoods and rubber boots, stylish this season,
were seen at Stanford. But not because they
were stylish this season. It was a rainy winter,
Stanford has no drainage system; and Peninsula
fog proves that down hair is more than a trend.
If this be rationalization, no one has uttered it
as such. These clothes were silently adopted,
and because they fitted the weather and the
women nobody thought they were very stylish.
Stanford is still "how" about traditions, espe
cially with high heels being spotted more fre
quently on Quad now that people are looking
for cigarette butts.
And as for all the fashion plates who walked
into Roble come Pre-Reg, they're still fashion
plates. But it's not Schiaparelli's fault. They
just know how to get along with tradition.—

IF Hattie Carnegie gives Schiaparelli some bad
moments, it's nothing to what a few Stanford
women would do to the poor expert's design
for living. Because while Hattie Carnegie may
recognize Schiaparelli's superiority come Paris
openings, Stanford women never will.
Farm women aren't that way about every
thing. They accept Graham Stuart's word on
neutrality, Dr. Guerard's views on Thomas
Mann—and some even believe what Max Fac
tor has to say about cosmetics.
But Schiaparelli has competition. And she
can't supersede that unimpeachable authority,
the Stanford woman.
She bows to herself—the girl whose Quad
clothes have been described as "classic," "dem
ocratic," and sloppy; who dresses so that San
Francisco will know she is not a Mills girl; who
at once sets the standard she is maintaining and
scrupulously maintains the standard she is set
ting.
