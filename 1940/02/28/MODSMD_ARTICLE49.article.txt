# CAMPUS OPINION
## BLANKETY BLANK 
### 
'THE EDITOR, SIR:
What strange infantile paralysis of thinking has
afflicted these campus opinioners? What childish hurt
has produced this reaction to an intelligent criticism
of "Gone With the Wind?" (Personally, I enjoyed
the show, but was in sympathy with Mr. Mellinkoff's
view that the picture was trite and long-winded
drama.)
Indignant Ida seems to be laboring under that old
illusion of the mediocre mind that anyone who criti
cizes what most other people like does so for the
effect. That is always the easy attitude. "You're cer
tainly hard to please!" is considered by many small
minds av an adequate answer to well-constructed
criticism.

Mr. Bulotti was at least intentionally funny, humor
having been effortlessly achieved by Indignant Ida.
But must that nonsense about .so-and-so-many mil
lion people proving anything at all about art be re
peated at a University even in jest? Most people who
rave about best-sellers have never read writers like
Galsworthy and Tolstoy, whose works survive wind
fall fashions in literature. There is nothing wrong with
being ignorant. But there is a great deal wrong with
making popular ignorance a virtue.

4 ND as for Mr. Blank the Second, he has given him
self away in his name. To paraphrase Gertrude
Stein, the matter may perhaps best bo impressed upon
him by saying "a blank is a blank is a blank."
As to the picture, "Gone With the Wind," it was, in
spite of its triteness, a fairly good Hollywood adven
ture story. The Daily's Bull Sessioner made criticisms
that were founded upon the assumption that Miss
Mitchell's work can be considered as a great book. I
don't think it can. It is just a terribly long Saturday
Evening Post story.
Hoping this heresy to the great God Popularity, suh,
is not deserving of a necktie party on the grounds that
