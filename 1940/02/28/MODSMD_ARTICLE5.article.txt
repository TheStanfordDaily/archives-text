# Tuesday Speaker Condemns Hollywood's Political Attitude
## 
### 
"The legitimate theater is, I believe, coining into its own again partly
because it can be as free-tongued as it wishes," said S. Stephenson Smith
in his lecture, "Broadway and Hollywood Tackle Politics," last night.
He traced the progress of the political comedy by specific plays from
jazz (o swing. Modern musical satire began during the depression

Kaufman and Riskin's "Of
Thee I Sing," Professor Smith ex
plained.
'IGNORED FACTS'
"I think the most notable advance
into politics that Hollywood has
made is 'Mr. Smith Goes to Wash
ington'," he commented; but he
continued to call it "immoral" be
cause "it ignored the fact that
American politics has to proceed by
making deals."
By painting things sharp black
and white in Horatio Alger fashion,
Hollywood earned the indignation of
Congress, was Professor Smith's
opinion.
"It did violence to their sense of
political realities," he declared.
•ASSUMED NAIVETE'
" 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington'
also assumed an incredibly naive
audience," the speaker said, "but
we're acquiring a more sophisticated
and, if you will, a more cynical
point of view."
What it takes to make a success
ful musical satire was summed up
by Professor Smith —funny enough
to please the top gallery but with
double meaning in the broad com
edy style for the more discerning.
