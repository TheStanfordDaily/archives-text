# BULL SESSION

### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
SONS (AND DAUGHTERS) OF THE
STANFORD RED
EVENING; I represent the Stanford Fund
Drive Committee. May I talk to you for a few
minutes?"
Thus will one hundred and sixty enthusiastic Stan
ford undergraduates descend upon the peninsula's
Stanford alumni. The doorbells will ring just as
though the caller were a Fuller brush man. And the
first, ever-anticipated greeting will be in the orthodox
salesman vogue: "Good evening." Every home-owner
has heard the words a hundred times, with the dread
feeling that someone is trying to sell him something.
But callers for the Stanford Fund Drive are not
salesmen. They will not plague a contented populace
by "talking it into something." They will call without
demonstration kits or free samples.
Every Stanford graduate has had his demonstration
already, and his sample of Stanford life. The Univer
sity's four-year demonstration must have given him a
great many things that are his for a long time —until
death or senile dementia. Among those things that
Stanford graduates have taken from the Farm is prob
ably a sense of pride in being a son (or daughter) of
the Stanford red.
* * *
r J I HERE are always criticisms that Stanford men and
women level at the school they are proud of. (Any
Daily man is quite sure of that.) But it would be hard
to find a misanthrope so incorrigibly cynical that he
does not at least inwardly bask in the traditions of the
Stanford name. Harvard may be the oldest; Cornell
may have its crew; S.C. may have an Atherton-doomed
football team; and the Campanile may be three feet
higher than the Hoover War Libe. But to any Stan
ford man Stanford means more than any of the world's
collegiate religions. Partly it is Stanford's well-de
served reputation as one of the best universities in the
world. But partly it is just having been given once and
for life a part of Stanford.
And that is why the Stanford Fund callers will not
have to use high-pressure tactics. That is why the
appeal for funds to maintain the material foundation
of the Stanford name does not rest upon salesmanship
or commercial ardor.
Any Stanford alumnus has a diploma which proves
that he has been made proud to be a son (or daugh
ter) of the Stanford red.
Any Stanford alumnus will do what he can to
maintain Stanford's high scholastic standards.
That is why the Stanford Fund callers have an easy
job—only the rain to contend with. And the rain is
much warmer than sales resistance.

But callers for the Stanford Fund Drive are not
salesmen. They will not plague a contented populace
by "talking it into something." They will call without
demonstration kits or free samples.
Every Stanford graduate has had his demonstration
already, and his sample of Stanford life. The Univer
sity's four-year demonstration must have given him a
great many things that are his for a long time —until
death or senile dementia. Among those things that
Stanford graduates have taken from the Farm is prob
ably a sense of pride in being a son (or daughter) of
the Stanford red.

r J I HERE are always criticisms that Stanford men and
women level at the school they are proud of. (Any
Daily man is quite sure of that.) But it would be hard
to find a misanthrope so incorrigibly cynical that he
does not at least inwardly bask in the traditions of the
Stanford name. Harvard may be the oldest; Cornell
may have its crew; S.C. may have an Atherton-doomed
football team; and the Campanile may be three feet
higher than the Hoover War Libe. But to any Stan
ford man Stanford means more than any of the world's
collegiate religions. Partly it is Stanford's well-de
served reputation as one of the best universities in the
world. But partly it is just having been given once and
for life a part of Stanford.
And that is why the Stanford Fund callers will not
have to use high-pressure tactics. That is why the
appeal for funds to maintain the material foundation
of the Stanford name does not rest upon salesmanship
or commercial ardor.
Any Stanford alumnus has a diploma which proves
that he has been made proud to be a son (or daugh
ter) of the Stanford red.
Any Stanford alumnus will do what he can to
maintain Stanford's high scholastic standards.
That is why the Stanford Fund callers have an easy
job—only the rain to contend with. And the rain is
much warmer than sales resistance.
SONS (AND DAUGHTERS) OF THE
STANFORD RED
EVENING; I represent the Stanford Fund
Drive Committee. May I talk to you for a few
minutes?"
Thus will one hundred and sixty enthusiastic Stan
ford undergraduates descend upon the peninsula's
Stanford alumni. The doorbells will ring just as
though the caller were a Fuller brush man. And the
first, ever-anticipated greeting will be in the orthodox
salesman vogue: "Good evening." Every home-owner
has heard the words a hundred times, with the dread
feeling that someone is trying to sell him something.
