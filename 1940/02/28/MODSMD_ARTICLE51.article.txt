# Lightly and Politely
## ABSOLUTELY NO IMAGINATION 
### DOUG JAQUES 
While the party was going on at the ofT-eampus
house, one of the guys living there was asleep in the
next room, but that of course did not stop the party.
And then all of a sudden they heard a bellow from
the next room. There is nothing a party likes as much
as noise. The people at a party are making noise
themselves and looking for noise, so when the guy
in the next room yelled, they were all immediately
attracted to this noise.
They found the guy sitting up in bed. "Does any
one," he said, "does anyone know any good dreams?"
It was a mixed party. No one answered.
