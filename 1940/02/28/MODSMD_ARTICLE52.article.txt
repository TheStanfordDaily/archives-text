Through all this downpour, the Kappa roof has been
leaking.
The current campus question is, can the Kappas
really float, or ean't they?
Year after year they have surprised everyone at the
Junior Water Carnival by being able to get more
women in a canoe at one time without the canoe
sinking than any other sorority on the campus.
To be on the safe side, it might be well for them
all to sleep in a canoe tonight.
Unless the Kappas have changed greatly, I sup
pose that will mean sleeping standing up.
