# ON THE JERSEY SIDE

### 
It was interesting to see the Palo Alto section of the
George and Margaret audience relax Tuesday night
and begin to enjoy the play during the brief third
act love-making scene between Roger and Frankie
(a female).
Their attitude during most of the play was one of
stern, shocked disapproval.
Perhaps they went to the play believing what they
had heard about the vagueness of the Englishman's
sense of humor. They expected parlor, not bedroom,
gags.
