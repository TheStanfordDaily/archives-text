He took to a bar after the show was out, and I hey
met some friends of theirs. She didn't drink anything
while they were there, but he had a couple and they
and their friends talked and danced.
They had been there about an hour, sitting there
in the stuffy room with the smoke all around, when
she said, "Shall we go?" He saw that she was pale and
there were beads of perspiration on her brow.
They started to leave. He stopped to talk to some
people on the dance floor, thinking she had stopped
with him. Then he turned to leave, just in time to
see her weave toward the bar, bounce off the bar to
the wall on the other side, lurch forward and fall out
the door right on her face.
He rushed over and picked her up. He waited
until he saw she was feeling better before he got the
car. She was all right again after she got in the car.
"I iust felt faint, that's all." she said.
"Sure."
"Gee, it's lucky you got to me when you did. If
you hadn't, I would have fallen out that door right on
my face."
And he told u little white lie.
