# Satire, Pathos Characterize Mystic Tales
## 
### 
"BOOK OF MIRACLES" by Ben
Hccht.
This collection of short stories is |
apt to come as quite a shock to those |
whose literary knowledge of Ben
Hecht is confined to his plays writ- j
ten in collaboration with Charles I
Mac Arthur. In "Book of Miracles"
the down-to-earth, tough writer of
"Front Page," "Lulu Belle," and
"Twentieth Century" has turned
mystic.
The surprising thing about this
turn of events is that the book is
good, and in the case of one or two
of the stories, downright superb.
Fortunately Hecht's compact, slug
ging style gives his subject matter a
force which keeps the plots, which
otherwise might have come near sen
timentality, definitely in touch with
the grimy reality of this world as
we know it.
DOUBTS GOI)
Bitter cynicism runs through most
of the tales, for Hecht seems to doubt
the efficacy of a miracle in this ma
terialistic age. And furthermore he
doubts God's ability to cope with
the problems it presents.
Two stories, one biting satire, and
the other hauntingly pathetic, illus
trate his attitude. The satire con
cerns a beautiful but dumb movie
actor, who is assigned to play the
part of the Christ in a Hollywood
spectacle complete with technicolor.
The Almighty happens to look down
from Heaven on the day they are
filming the crucifixion, and, shocked
to see hisiory repeating itself, trans
ports the actor to heaven.
ACTOR CONVINCES GOD
The actor manages to explain how
it is with Hollywood, and God ap- I
proves the idea of retelling the story
so that all may get the message
through the new medium. And to
make the thing more authentic, He
puts His light on the actor's brow.
The result is that the actor's career
is ruined, for he simply will not pho
tograph any more. All the film re
cords is a bright white light where
his face should be. He winds up a
bitter man, distinctly annoyed with
the whole Heavenly afiair.
The other story puts God in a more
sympathetic light, for He sees the
state of affairs on earth, and sends
the Archangel Michael to become
the second Son of God. Michael
grows to young manhood, and be
gins to live the life of a Savior, but
he sees the terrible plight of the
steel workers in a Pennsylvania
town, and turns against his God.
He dies a man, the poorest and
most beaten of them all, but even at
his death he refuses to acknowledge
God, for he has come to know that
man's heroic courage in simply living
at all is more magnificent and im
portant than the mere recognition of
his Creator.
TELLS OF POGROM
Best of the whole lot, however, is
the story which begins after a tre
mendous European pogrom has been
progressing for a few days. A few
of the oldest and most devout of the
orthodox Jews have gathered in a
tiny New York synagogue to hear
their learned and holiest of rabbis
pray.
Suddenly he sends them home, and
in the silence of the little church he
blasphemes ajyunst Jehovah and
begs Him to destroy His chosen
people, because their creation was
a mistake. It's impossible to put
across the impact of that prayer, full
of the tragedy and hopelessness of
an old man sick of the age-long
struggle of his race.
Other miracles are concerned with
a steel worker's soul imprisoned in
a steel girder, and a rabbi who is
murdered by the descendant of a
renegade Jew who had turned Jesuit
and become the most fierce of the
Inquisitionists.
Cutting through Hecht's mystic
yarns is its hard-boiled recognition ol
what the ordinary folks' reactions
wouid be. He writes of miracles, but
he has no faith in them.—Nowell

spectacle complete with technicolor.
The Almighty happens to look down
from Heaven on the day they are
filming the crucifixion, and, shocked
to see hisiory repeating itself, trans
ports the actor to heaven.
ACTOR CONVINCES GOD
The actor manages to explain how
it is with Hollywood, and God ap- I
proves the idea of retelling the story
so that all may get the message
through the new medium. And to
make the thing more authentic, He
puts His light on the actor's brow.
The result is that the actor's career
is ruined, for he simply will not pho
tograph any more. All the film re
cords is a bright white light where
his face should be. He winds up a
bitter man, distinctly annoyed with
the whole Heavenly afiair.
The other story puts God in a more
sympathetic light, for He sees the
state of affairs on earth, and sends
the Archangel Michael to become
the second Son of God. Michael
grows to young manhood, and be
gins to live the life of a Savior, but
he sees the terrible plight of the
steel workers in a Pennsylvania
town, and turns against his God.
He dies a man, the poorest and
most beaten of them all, but even at
his death he refuses to acknowledge
God, for he has come to know that
man's heroic courage in simply living
at all is more magnificent and im
portant than the mere recognition of
his Creator.
TELLS OF POGROM
Best of the whole lot, however, is
the story which begins after a tre
mendous European pogrom has been
progressing for a few days. A few
of the oldest and most devout of the
orthodox Jews have gathered in a
tiny New York synagogue to hear
their learned and holiest of rabbis
pray.
Suddenly he sends them home, and
in the silence of the little church he
blasphemes ajyunst Jehovah and
begs Him to destroy His chosen
people, because their creation was
a mistake. It's impossible to put
across the impact of that prayer, full
of the tragedy and hopelessness of
an old man sick of the age-long
struggle of his race.
Other miracles are concerned with
a steel worker's soul imprisoned in
a steel girder, and a rabbi who is
murdered by the descendant of a
renegade Jew who had turned Jesuit
and become the most fierce of the
Inquisitionists.
Cutting through Hecht's mystic
yarns is its hard-boiled recognition ol
what the ordinary folks' reactions
wouid be. He writes of miracles, but
he has no faith in them.—Nowell
"BOOK OF MIRACLES" by Ben
Hccht.
This collection of short stories is |
apt to come as quite a shock to those |
whose literary knowledge of Ben
Hecht is confined to his plays writ- j
ten in collaboration with Charles I
Mac Arthur. In "Book of Miracles"
the down-to-earth, tough writer of
"Front Page," "Lulu Belle," and
"Twentieth Century" has turned
mystic.
The surprising thing about this
turn of events is that the book is
good, and in the case of one or two
of the stories, downright superb.
Fortunately Hecht's compact, slug
ging style gives his subject matter a
force which keeps the plots, which
otherwise might have come near sen
timentality, definitely in touch with
the grimy reality of this world as
we know it.
DOUBTS GOI)
Bitter cynicism runs through most
of the tales, for Hecht seems to doubt
the efficacy of a miracle in this ma
terialistic age. And furthermore he
doubts God's ability to cope with
the problems it presents.
Two stories, one biting satire, and
the other hauntingly pathetic, illus
trate his attitude. The satire con
cerns a beautiful but dumb movie
actor, who is assigned to play the

portant than the mere recognition of
his Creator.
TELLS OF POGROM
Best of the whole lot, however, is
the story which begins after a tre
mendous European pogrom has been
progressing for a few days. A few
of the oldest and most devout of the
orthodox Jews have gathered in a
tiny New York synagogue to hear
their learned and holiest of rabbis
pray.
Suddenly he sends them home, and
in the silence of the little church he
blasphemes ajyunst Jehovah and
begs Him to destroy His chosen
people, because their creation was
a mistake. It's impossible to put
across the impact of that prayer, full
of the tragedy and hopelessness of
an old man sick of the age-long
struggle of his race.
Other miracles are concerned with
a steel worker's soul imprisoned in
a steel girder, and a rabbi who is
murdered by the descendant of a
renegade Jew who had turned Jesuit
and become the most fierce of the
Inquisitionists.
Cutting through Hecht's mystic
yarns is its hard-boiled recognition ol
what the ordinary folks' reactions
wouid be. He writes of miracles, but
he has no faith in them.—Nowell
