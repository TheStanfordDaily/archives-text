# Sport Clothes Stay Practical Even Though Glamorous
## Denim Makes Playsuits As Longer Shorts Appear 
### 
Active sports clothes this year may he practical, glamorous, or just
cute, depending on your type and sporting propensities. However, a lew
trends, hinted at last year, are now in full hlooin.
Shorts are longer and fuller with pleating in hoth front and hack.
Skirls to wear over play clothes are now practically de-rigour and these

are, without exception, very full.<
Tern lis and badminton suits are one
piece, designed for freedom of move
ment and practical use.
The bare mid-riff is taking hold,
no doubt for those who yearn for
tan tummies. Biggest new thing is
the "loafer" or "bush" coat with
tremendous "cash-and-carry" pock
ets. The "loafer" is a boxy loose
jacket, with six-inch slits up the
r ides to be worn with slacks or
shorts.
DENIM'S TIIE STUFF
Many of these outfits are being
made in a new soft denim in all the
pastel shades. Also being used is a
new Norwegian cloth, rather of the
denim texture, which is guaran
teed to last the life of the garment.
Heavy coarse, hand-knit "shortie"
sweaters are also being used with
slacks.
Checks, plaids, and stripes arc be
ing combined with faded-blue den
im in the play suits. The suits are
made in the bright-colored fabrics
and then loafer jackets in blue den
im are used with a detachable hood
lined in the same fabric as the
play suit.
TAILORING PREFERRED
Separate sport shirts are still
along the classic Hendan lines, but
striped shirts with long sleeves will
be running them a close second.
Draped fronts are struggling
against tailored slacks in some of
the shops, but they're having a
tough time. For it slacks are for
YOU at all, the sleek tailored line is
much the best, or so the sales-girls
say.
Slack tops are in two types: the
beer-jacket type which is worn on
the outside alone; and the "inner or
outer" designed to be worn just
what the name implies.
For over-skirts plain cloth, strip
ed. or wild tahitian prints may be
had. These often have a matching
play-suit with a hooded jacket lined
in the same fabric, though the jack
et will be in contrast.
FEMININE TOUCHES
Among the more feminine wrin
kles in the play-clothes market is
the white jersey tennis dress being
featured by one of the local shops.
I! is designed with built-up shoul
der- and a white jersey petticoat
under the short full skirt. Tight -
litting jersey panties complete the
ensemble. This same shop is also
showing full white shark-skin shorts
with boat-necked uppers of red
jersey.
THE HEACII OUTFITS
Another Paly store is featuring the
startling beach outfit shown on a re
cent Mademoiselle cover. This is the
one with red jersey skirt, wide gold
"irdle, and striped blue and white
jersey top. White shark-skin tai
lored slacks worn with brilliant
i oman-striped bengaline shirts are
also on display.
Best, of the whole slack collection,
however, are the imported white or
maize flannel Braemars with plaid
trim, and you can get classic
Braemar sweaters to match.
