Now that skirts are short and get
ting shorter, legs are once more in
the public eye. Once more the
shape of women's legs becomes im
portant.
"Feet first." is the motto of most

in size 5 shoes is not only ruining
the good looks of her feet, and legs
but also her general health, and in
many cases, her disposition.
Ankles, calves, and thighs with a
circumference greater than that
demanded by beauty can be made
smaller through conscientious exer
cise. And knees, says one expert,
are considerably better shaped if
ihe girl foregoes round garters.
