# Fashion Quirks To Complicate Sun Bathing
## New Dark Classes Give Beach-Goers 'Flower Face' Look 
### 
This early in the season, it's diffi
cult to predict just what new screwi
nesses in the way of beach novelties
will arise to make the simple act of
getting a tan even more involved,
but one or two things have come up.
Primary among these are the new
sun glasses with pie-crust rims,
which are supposed to aid in mini
mizing glare. These come in bright
red, and they give the wearer a look
which can only be described as
"flower-laced."
Of course, the tremendous rubber
lined beach bag will be back, simply
because it's so practical. These hold
your suit, cap, towel, a complete set
of sun-tan goo, and will undoubt
edly, in the very near future be de
signed so that a beach umbrella will
just fit.
Big, vari-colored hats, for those
who burn, are as good as ever be
fore, and the beach robe can be seen
in the classic long terry cloth in all
hues, or in swim-suit lengths with
hoods.
