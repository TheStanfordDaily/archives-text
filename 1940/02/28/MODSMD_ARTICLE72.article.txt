# Wedge Heels Give Shoes a Build-Up
## 
### 
This year shoes are receiving a
j build-up and platform soles as well.
1 Of course low-heeled oxfords and
saddle-shoes are old standbys for
campus wear.
II you want to try something new
in evening slippers there's a red
kid sandal with a high wedge heel
;or you can have a hooded-ankle
slipper with a new cantilever heel.
Play shoes are using dyed calf in
stead of fabric this season. There's
a pair of blue reversed calf with
wedge heels that you'll want the
1 minute you see them. Calfskin shoes
I with contrasting platform or rubber
soles have first place this season.
