## 
### 
Parisian couturiers started the cur- |
rent vogue for pockets at the out-j
break of the war. In times of emer- |
gency they were much more practi- j
cal than purses. And now the ide.i |
has spread to American fashions.
The newest spring skirts feature i
huge pouchy pockets, many of them j
hung lrom the belt. Jackets have as,
many as eight of them in neat rows.
Full pockets on straight skirts give |
a peg-top effect that relieves the i
severity of line, and they're wonder- :
ful for those scores of "little things"!
that women never have a plate for.
