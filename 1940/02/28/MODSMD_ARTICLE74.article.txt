gabardines.
To go with these trousers, found
usually in navy or black, stores are
showing waist-length jackets made
of water-proof materials. Elastic in
the waist band of one jacket gives
that "slim middle" look. One store
in Palo Alto shows these jackets
with a detachable hood in beii'.e, rust,
and light blue.
