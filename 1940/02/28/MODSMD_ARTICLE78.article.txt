# Old-Fashioned Lingerie Goes Back to Nightie
## 
### 
"Old-fashioned and feminine" is
fashion's dictum for lingerie this
season, and as spring approaches the
young woman's fancy turns to rib
bons and ruffles.
Quaint as the bustle and more
charming is the camisole slip, revived
last fall and giving promise of en
hancing many a sheer blouse this
spring. Shown in dnlicate cotton
dimities and batistes as well as the
usual silk and rayon fabrics, they
are as daintily beribboned as those
our mothers and grandmothers wore.
A tantalizing variety of petticoats
are to be found. Rustling taffetas, in
stripes, plaids, and plain colors vie
with the pink and blue ribbon bead
ing and dainty eyelet embroidery of
demure dimities.
NIGHTGOWNS POPULAR
In nothing is the feminine trend
more evident than in nightgowns,
and the most confirmed pajama
wearer would weaken at the sight
of the lovely printed dimities. One
in a red and white candy stripe with
lace-edged square neck and im
mensely full skirt particularly takes
the eye.
The prices of these lovely cotton
articles are positively a revelation to
most, and speaking of materials, they
tell us batiste will reappear this sea
son for the first time in many years.
PAJAMAS ARE LOUDER
Manufacturers have not over
looked the fact that some pajama
wearers refuse to be converted, and,
in spite of the trend, pajamas are
louder than ever, bright prints,
stripes and plaids predominating. For
convenience' sake try the three
piece outfit; a loose jacket has been
added for studying or loafing.
When it comes to girdles and the
like, fashion tells us boning and
lacing are a modern necessity, and
who knows, we may come to it yet.
If the seven teen-inch waist seems a
little far fetched, corsetieres claim to
create the illusion without sacrificing
100 much comfort. Scarlett, what
have you done to us?

stripes, plaids, and plain colors vie
with the pink and blue ribbon bead
ing and dainty eyelet embroidery of
demure dimities.
NIGHTGOWNS POPULAR
In nothing is the feminine trend
more evident than in nightgowns,
and the most confirmed pajama
wearer would weaken at the sight
of the lovely printed dimities. One
in a red and white candy stripe with
lace-edged square neck and im
mensely full skirt particularly takes
the eye.
The prices of these lovely cotton
articles are positively a revelation to
most, and speaking of materials, they
tell us batiste will reappear this sea
son for the first time in many years.
PAJAMAS ARE LOUDER
Manufacturers have not over
looked the fact that some pajama
wearers refuse to be converted, and,
in spite of the trend, pajamas are
louder than ever, bright prints,
stripes and plaids predominating. For
convenience' sake try the three
piece outfit; a loose jacket has been
added for studying or loafing.
When it comes to girdles and the
like, fashion tells us boning and
lacing are a modern necessity, and
who knows, we may come to it yet.
If the seven teen-inch waist seems a
little far fetched, corsetieres claim to
create the illusion without sacrificing
100 much comfort. Scarlett, what
have you done to us?
