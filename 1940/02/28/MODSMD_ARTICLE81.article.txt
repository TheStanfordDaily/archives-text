# Shoes Follow Trend Toward Quiet Elegance
## Black, Navy Prevail For Dress; Sports Use Gayer Styling 
### 
Pushkin wrote sonnets praising the
j beauty of w°>'ien's feet. Today, de
signers of women's footwear accent
| and beautify the lines of the feet.
Following the prevailing emphasis
on quiet elegance, footwear is lovely
to look at but never sensational or
extreme.
Black and navy hold the spotlight
j for color; any other shade for dress
j wear seems just a little out of place.
(However, you can be as gay as you
! like for sports wear.) But it's a mis
j take to think that shoes must look
uninteresting: combinations of dull
and glowing materials, colored trims
in small amounts, and clever styling
prevail.
WEDGIES GAIN FAVOR
And then there are the wedgies.
This style, that looked so bizarre
three years ago, has steadily been
gaining favor both for its comfort
and for its possibilities of novel
treatment. Wedgies having con
quered the beach now enter the
drawing room.
They are seen everywhere, and
worn for everything. In gleaming
satin for formal wear, in luminous
patent for daytime dress, and in
sturdier leathers for sport. A local
store has black patent dancing-school
pumps, which achieve sophistication
with their two-and-one-half-inch
wedge soles.
SMALL TOE-OPENINGS
Fashion seems unable to make up
her mind about open toes. Open
heels are rare, but exposed toes are
still very much with us, despite dis
paraging comments from the men.
However, this season, the toe-open
ings are very small; only a tantaliz
ing glimpse is afforded.
A great many shoes completely
cover the toe; and niany are boxed,
as the fall shoes were. Some are
even squared off and built up to
suggest a Dutch girl's wooden shoe.
SPORTS PUMPS REMAIN
Breathe a sigh of relief—spectator
sports pumps and saddle oxfords are
still as ever. For those who
want innovation, some of the pumps
now have high wedge-heels while
some designers add new interest to
saddles by tying them at the side, or
putting colored soles on them. Some
saddles have wedge-soles, too.
The importance of matching ac
cessories has been recognized by
many designers. One forward-look
ing firm puts out an ingenious chart
that shows what color hosiery to
wear with each of the more impor
tant colors.

SMALL TOE-OPENINGS
Fashion seems unable to make up
her mind about open toes. Open
heels are rare, but exposed toes are
still very much with us, despite dis
paraging comments from the men.
However, this season, the toe-open
ings are very small; only a tantaliz
ing glimpse is afforded.
A great many shoes completely
cover the toe; and niany are boxed,
as the fall shoes were. Some are
even squared off and built up to
suggest a Dutch girl's wooden shoe.
SPORTS PUMPS REMAIN
Breathe a sigh of relief—spectator
sports pumps and saddle oxfords are
still as ever. For those who
want innovation, some of the pumps
now have high wedge-heels while
some designers add new interest to
saddles by tying them at the side, or
putting colored soles on them. Some
saddles have wedge-soles, too.
The importance of matching ac
cessories has been recognized by
many designers. One forward-look
ing firm puts out an ingenious chart
that shows what color hosiery to
wear with each of the more impor
tant colors.

Following the prevailing emphasis

WEDGIES GAIN FAVOR
And then there are the wedgies.
This style, that looked so bizarre
three years ago, has steadily been
gaining favor both for its comfort
and for its possibilities of novel
treatment. Wedgies having con
quered the beach now enter the
drawing room.
They are seen everywhere, and
worn for everything. In gleaming
satin for formal wear, in luminous
patent for daytime dress, and in
sturdier leathers for sport. A local
store has black patent dancing-school
pumps, which achieve sophistication
with their two-and-one-half-inch
wedge soles.
