# Spring's Song For 1940 Lies In Novel, Daring Color Scheme
## 
### 
Songs of the 1940 spring are the
new exciting pastels — blues with
new daring punch—pinks that are
warming up—yellows that are turn
ing gold—and greens that are dash
ing in their vivacity.
Giddy plaids, precious, precise
shepherd checks, delicate, muted
stripes, and flocks of polka-dots are
popping out in the gamut of spring
pastels. Almost any design can be
found on almost any kind of fabric—
wool, jersey, pique, silk, or linen ot
suit any ensemble or taste.
PASTEL SPRING SONG
Theme of this new spring song is
pastel accessories. Colored gloves—
dusty rose to accent a warm grey—
pale blue to contrast with navy—are
practically a necessity.
And going along as close as "hand
in glove" are matching spring posies
for the lapel or bonnet and sheer
pastel blouses. Imagination can run
rampant in matching pastel colors to
a new hat — perhaps the Easter
bonnet.
With the now trick of this year's
spring being to look discreetly dress
ed-up in a simple way, first and
foremost among the musts are soft
wool pastel dresses, suits and dress
maker coats.
LIGHT-WEIGHT WOOLS
Fresh wearables of the coming sea
son are light-weight pastel woolen
dresses with matching jackets—bo
leros, short basques, long tunics, or.
redingotes.
Invading the field of wraps, spring
pastels are popularizing new trends
in coats. Some, in peppery yellow,
sky blue, or tomato pink, are fitted
at the waist and Hare, others swing

loosely from the shoulder—but most
are pastel-hued, with or without
spring fur collars.
NATURE IN BLOOM
Cotton pastels again come into
their own, and follow styles around
the clock. Nature in full bloom has
no better mirror than in the new
pastel seersuckers, chambrays, and
linens. Wear them in shirtmakers,
formals, suits, play-clothes — but
wear them in pastels.
Inspiring combinations of the new
canyon tan or kelly green or the
soft steel gray—or simple one-color
blues, pinks, or yellows—wear these
as you please—but wear pastels, the
excitement of this year's spring.

PASTEL SPRING SONG
Theme of this new spring song is
pastel accessories. Colored gloves—
dusty rose to accent a warm grey—
pale blue to contrast with navy—are
practically a necessity.
And going along as close as "hand
in glove" are matching spring posies
for the lapel or bonnet and sheer
pastel blouses. Imagination can run
rampant in matching pastel colors to
a new hat — perhaps the Easter
bonnet.
With the now trick of this year's
spring being to look discreetly dress
ed-up in a simple way, first and
foremost among the musts are soft
wool pastel dresses, suits and dress
maker coats.
LIGHT-WEIGHT WOOLS
Fresh wearables of the coming sea
son are light-weight pastel woolen
dresses with matching jackets—bo
leros, short basques, long tunics, or.
redingotes.
Invading the field of wraps, spring
pastels are popularizing new trends
in coats. Some, in peppery yellow,
sky blue, or tomato pink, are fitted
at the waist and Hare, others swing

loosely from the shoulder—but most
are pastel-hued, with or without
spring fur collars.
NATURE IN BLOOM
Cotton pastels again come into
their own, and follow styles around
the clock. Nature in full bloom has
no better mirror than in the new
pastel seersuckers, chambrays, and
linens. Wear them in shirtmakers,
formals, suits, play-clothes — but
wear them in pastels.
Inspiring combinations of the new
canyon tan or kelly green or the
soft steel gray—or simple one-color
blues, pinks, or yellows—wear these
as you please—but wear pastels, the
excitement of this year's spring.
Songs of the 1940 spring are the
new exciting pastels — blues with
new daring punch—pinks that are
warming up—yellows that are turn
ing gold—and greens that are dash
ing in their vivacity.
Giddy plaids, precious, precise
shepherd checks, delicate, muted
stripes, and flocks of polka-dots are
popping out in the gamut of spring
pastels. Almost any design can be
found on almost any kind of fabric—
wool, jersey, pique, silk, or linen ot
suit any ensemble or taste.
