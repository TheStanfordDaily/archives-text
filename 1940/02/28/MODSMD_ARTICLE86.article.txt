# Coeds Ignore Hair Whims
## New Hats Influence Sleek Coiffures 
### 
Simplicity and informality have
i always been the primary requisites
j of college girls for their hair-dos.
j Numerous tight curls, stiff lacquered
I waves being scorned as unfit for
| campus wear with flats and tweeds,
I even coiffures for evening remaining
1 relatively simple. So it is that fash
i ion's elaborate hair whims receive
| little attention from the co-ed.
However, recent developments in
j the fashion world forecast greater
| adaptability of fashion's latest inspi-
I rations to the needs of college girls.
I The much - publicized "up" hair
dress, decreed as the only fashion-fit
I hair style in '38 and '39, has died an
| ignominious death. Although the
i fever for piling milady's hair on the
I top of her head is still with the hair
stylists, it is now being gone after
j in much more subtle fashion.
COIFFURE ASPIRES
The upward line is now being
achieved by swirling the hair up from
the sides, or up from the forehead,
and the long bob, once so scorned by
fashion fanatics, again reigns su
preme. Gone are the elaborate, in
tricate pilings of curls on the tof>s of
heads. Instead, simplicity and sleek
ness are the keynotes for spring.
Probably spring hats are the great
est influence for the sleek mode, for
Vogue predicts that turbans, close
to-the head hats, casual, slouchy
hats, and the immortal sailor will
dominate the spring scene. Hair
dressers this year, through necessity,
must devise smooth, sweeping styles
that are capable of fitting beneath
tight turbans and coming out none
the worse for wear. Nor do trim
sailors go well with fussy, impracti
cal coiffures.
RULES OF THE GAME
While revamping the hair's per
sonality, bear in mind continually
the following questions, and chances
of success will be doubled. (1) Does
it do something for the particular
shape of face? (2) Is it practical for
the kind of hair? (3) Is it well pro
portioned to the figure? (4) Does it
suit the age and way of living? (5)
Does it show proper respect for
fashion? (6) Is it neat and well
groomed? (7) Is it equally good with
or without a hat? (8) Can it be
adapted to special social occasions
with ease? (9) Can it be easily
cared for between visits to the hair
dresser? (10) Do friends often say,
j "How nice your hair looks'*?

Probably spring hats are the great
est influence for the sleek mode, for
Vogue predicts that turbans, close
to-the head hats, casual, slouchy
hats, and the immortal sailor will
dominate the spring scene. Hair
dressers this year, through necessity,
must devise smooth, sweeping styles
that are capable of fitting beneath
tight turbans and coming out none
the worse for wear. Nor do trim
sailors go well with fussy, impracti
cal coiffures.
RULES OF THE GAME
While revamping the hair's per
sonality, bear in mind continually
the following questions, and chances
of success will be doubled. (1) Does
it do something for the particular
shape of face? (2) Is it practical for
the kind of hair? (3) Is it well pro
portioned to the figure? (4) Does it
suit the age and way of living? (5)
Does it show proper respect for
fashion? (6) Is it neat and well
groomed? (7) Is it equally good with
or without a hat? (8) Can it be
adapted to special social occasions
with ease? (9) Can it be easily
cared for between visits to the hair
dresser? (10) Do friends often say,
j "How nice your hair looks'*?
Simplicity and informality have
i always been the primary requisites
j of college girls for their hair-dos.
j Numerous tight curls, stiff lacquered
I waves being scorned as unfit for
| campus wear with flats and tweeds,
I even coiffures for evening remaining
1 relatively simple. So it is that fash
i ion's elaborate hair whims receive
| little attention from the co-ed.
However, recent developments in
j the fashion world forecast greater
| adaptability of fashion's latest inspi-
I rations to the needs of college girls.
I The much - publicized "up" hair
dress, decreed as the only fashion-fit
I hair style in '38 and '39, has died an

i fever for piling milady's hair on the
I top of her head is still with the hair
stylists, it is now being gone after
j in much more subtle fashion.
COIFFURE ASPIRES
The upward line is now being
achieved by swirling the hair up from
the sides, or up from the forehead,
and the long bob, once so scorned by
fashion fanatics, again reigns su
preme. Gone are the elaborate, in
tricate pilings of curls on the tof>s of
heads. Instead, simplicity and sleek
