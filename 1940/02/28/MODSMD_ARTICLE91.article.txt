# Military Influences Seen in Color, Style of Spring Suits
## New Silhouette Follows Lines Of Uniforms 
### MARY JUDSON 
"Three Cheers for the Red, White
and Blue" is the patriotic call of
the fashion designers this year as
they swing into a new spring sea
son of designing .suits for milady.
The army and navy rate this year
in a big way when it comes to styles
lor suits. Everything has taken a
turn for the military for spring cos
tumes. as war influences seep over
from Paris.
The craze for epaulets last winter
just started the fad which has
turned to a military silhouette to
keep iu tune with soldier boys.
Wide shoulders and slash pockets
c;irry out this idea, and new suits
with braid trim in the way of frog
buttonholes and pocket loop designs
nnd insignia give that Major-Gen
eral look. White button trims are es
pecially effective as sergeant or
corporal stripes on the sleeve or
pocket.
NAVY TOP COLOR
Navy is the top color this year,
with dashing touches of red and
white for accessory shades. Middy
blue is a new shade which is fast
becoming popular, especially when
turned out in the novel Covei't
cloth, a smooth-weave, all-wool
fabric with faint white threads wov
en in to give the illusion of a stripe.
Khaki is also making a comeback
and will be seen a lot, especially
when lighter cotton fabrics take over
for summer costumes. Accessories
for this shade will be good in red
or in the new brown—"milk choco
late."

Gray hasn t been forgotten either,
as it ranks second to navy, and is
especially effective when trimmed in
red braid or buttons. Smooth flan
nels or light serges in this color
have proven best to give that "uni
form" appearance. Black, of course,
is ever popular.
For college wear the pastels still
hold forth as most becoming and
popular. Light tweed suits in spring
shades, either solid color or com
bined, are still close to the heart of
the co-ed. Three-piece suits of this
type are proving exceptional buys
this year.
FITTED SILHOUETTE
The fitted form in suits carries on,
but wider seaming is making an
appearance on lapels. Pastel Glenn
plaids arc found to be the most popu
lar for contrast jackets, as a carry
over from winter's plaid craze. Fab
rics which will make more of a
showing as the season wears on are
rayon crepe, bengaline, and twill
worsted.
Accessories for suits show more
jewelry for lapels and less and less
in the flower line. Wide hats arc
very good this year for wear with a
spring costume, and the white "lin
gerie" touch is becoming in the
form of lacy jabots and blouse
fronts.

showing as the season wears on are
rayon crepe, bengaline, and twill
worsted.
Accessories for suits show more
jewelry for lapels and less and less
in the flower line. Wide hats arc
very good this year for wear with a
spring costume, and the white "lin
gerie" touch is becoming in the
form of lacy jabots and blouse
fronts.
"Three Cheers for the Red, White
and Blue" is the patriotic call of
the fashion designers this year as
they swing into a new spring sea
son of designing .suits for milady.
The army and navy rate this year
in a big way when it comes to styles
lor suits. Everything has taken a
turn for the military for spring cos
tumes. as war influences seep over
from Paris.
The craze for epaulets last winter
just started the fad which has
turned to a military silhouette to
keep iu tune with soldier boys.
Wide shoulders and slash pockets
c;irry out this idea, and new suits
with braid trim in the way of frog
buttonholes and pocket loop designs
nnd insignia give that Major-Gen
eral look. White button trims are es
pecially effective as sergeant or
corporal stripes on the sleeve or
pocket.
NAVY TOP COLOR
Navy is the top color this year,
with dashing touches of red and
white for accessory shades. Middy
blue is a new shade which is fast
becoming popular, especially when
turned out in the novel Covei't
cloth, a smooth-weave, all-wool
fabric with faint white threads wov
en in to give the illusion of a stripe.
Khaki is also making a comeback
and will be seen a lot, especially
when lighter cotton fabrics take over
for summer costumes. Accessories
for this shade will be good in red
or in the new brown—"milk choco
late."

Gray hasn t been forgotten either,
as it ranks second to navy, and is
especially effective when trimmed in
red braid or buttons. Smooth flan
nels or light serges in this color
have proven best to give that "uni
form" appearance. Black, of course,
is ever popular.
For college wear the pastels still
hold forth as most becoming and
popular. Light tweed suits in spring
shades, either solid color or com
bined, are still close to the heart of
the co-ed. Three-piece suits of this
type are proving exceptional buys
this year.
FITTED SILHOUETTE
The fitted form in suits carries on,
but wider seaming is making an
appearance on lapels. Pastel Glenn
plaids arc found to be the most popu
lar for contrast jackets, as a carry
over from winter's plaid craze. Fab
rics which will make more of a

rayon crepe, bengaline, and twill
worsted.
