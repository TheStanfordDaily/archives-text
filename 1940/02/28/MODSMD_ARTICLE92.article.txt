# New York Adopts Mexican Buckles
## 
### 
Smart New Yorkers are taking
over the wonderfully carved Mexi
can leather belts so popular with
Western ranchers for many years.
These can be obtained in a variety
of designs, from roses to intricate
leaf patterns. The broad, true West
ern type usually buckle in front with
twin fastenings.
Solid silver buckles, made by the
Navajo craftsmen, arc added to sports
dresses for variety. Buttons made
lo match the buckles arc gaining in
popularity, as are the gay blue, red
and yellow wool belts woven by the
Indian tribesmen.
