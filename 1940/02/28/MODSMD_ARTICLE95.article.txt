# Men Concede Ignorance Of Female Garb
## 
### 
It is an established principle of
j our society that no man should
I comment on women's clothes with
j out first reading Emily Post and
| consulting a successful diplomat.
Compared to the perils and pit
falls that lie in a simple remark
about the way a dress looks, and
African jungle complete with black
mambas and unfed tigers is as safe
as a nursery.
If a man says he doesn't know
| enough to comment, he is called
callous, self-centered, blind, and ho
is left with Ihc impression that to
remain in character, he must club
the next baby he runs across. If
his remarks show a knowledge of
the subject, there are suspicious
looks; eyebrows arch like an irri
tated cat; and somebody asks, in
I good imitation of a monk of the In-
I quisit.ion how he got to know so
I much about women's clothes.
RUIN I.OOMS
Just to call a slip a slip instead of
ja "watdyucallit" is enough to ruin
a man's reputation.
I And so the wise male will stick to
that ancient remark, "It looks gor
geous, my dear." This may sound a
bit thin at times, but it is tested
and proved thoroughly safe. There
are no elusive connotations waiting
to spring when your back is turned,
no subtle shades of meaning that
may turn and snap at you.
HANDY TIIAI'-DOOli'
In short, this is a convenient trap
door that provides escape from that
dangerous question: "How does it
look?"
Never, men do have ideas on
women's clothesâ€” vague ones, most
of which come from reading the lin
gerie ads that talk about the com-
I forts of cross ventilation and ver
tical pull as opposed as air condi
tioning and lateral adjustment.
