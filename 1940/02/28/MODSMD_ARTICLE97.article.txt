# 'Back to Farm' to Quiet Clothes Conscious Rough
## 
### MARGE HOVEY 
For years Stanford men have been
complaining that the women dress
too fussily on Quad. And the women
have retaliated with the charges that
"the good old days of the rough" are
no more. The women have been ac
cused of following the dictates of
Hollywood's colleges, and the men,
of Phelps-Terkel.
But next week all will be happy
because it's "Back to the Farm Week"
and the roughs and women of the
"days of the 500" will reign again.
This idea appeals to most of us un
til we start wondering what to wear.
Looking through some of the pre
war Quads one sees women in skirts
and shirtwaists, practically the same
as skirts and shirts today. But if
one goes back 20 years more to the
days when Mrs. Stanford was sell
ing her jewels to "give poor boys
an education," the clothes become
amusing and certainly different.
IN OS TIIEY WORE—
The skirts had definite bustles,
while the blouses all had long
sleeves and high collars fastened
with large brooches. And in carry
ing this costume out, add black cot
ton stockings and shoes covering the
j ankles.
But the founders of "Back to the
, Farm Week" don't insist on a com
i plete return to the old-fashioned
; styles. And probably the most popu
lar costume will be bright gingham
dresses and bobby socks, with the
| old taboo lifted for a few days.
CHAIRMAN QUESTIONED
Co-Chairman Bill Turner, when
i questioned about the proper clothes,
> said "I don't know much about fash
ions, but the girls can think up all
sorts of combinations, either in the
! old-fashioned style or the farm
I type."
This leaves a wide range of cos
| tumes, one can either be a farm girl
1 and comfortable or a 500 woman
! and historical. And don't forget the
short skirted, long-waistcd dresses
of the late twenties—that was the 500
era too.
MEN WORE TIES
The men will probably be disap
j pointed to know that in the good
; old days all men wore ties, but they
| will probably omit thus last authen
tic touch in their costumes. At any
! rate Prof. Gallup could have a field
day testing farm opinions of how the
' other sex should dress after they

have "gone back to the farm."
Several of the Paly stores have
large stocks of inexpensive cotton
dresses in bright shades, stripes, or
any other pattern you want. Pina
fore dresses that are enjoying a re
vival in the warm country will prob
ably adorn many a farm girl.
HEELS (iO IN DISURACE
Heels have never been approved
for quad wear and a week from Fri
day will definitely not be the day to
try them. Hair ribbons will com
plete the unsophisticated costumes.
Climax to the celebrations, in a
fashion sense, will be the "Dance
of the 500" on March 8. Chairmen
have planned to award prizes to
the most appropriate costumes there.
