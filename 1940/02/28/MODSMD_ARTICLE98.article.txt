# Table-cloth Checks Brighten Costumes
## 
### 
Table-cloth-checked in red and
white in spun rayon, grey-and-yel
low combined in a slightly tailored,
but still feminine chiffon blouse, are
special favorites this spring.
Blouses, frothy at the throat of
white mousseline de soie or some j
sheer material, with bibs, bows, and
culfs trimmed with pleated laces,
are the height of femininity.
