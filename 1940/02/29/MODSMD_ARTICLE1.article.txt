(•tpOGO sticks and silken pants
for Finland."
In a move that at first looked like
the first active demonstration of
Finnish aid from a foreign nation,
the House of Representatives yes
terday passed the Senate-approved
export-import bank bill providing
for loans of a non-military nature to
Finland, China, and other needy
nations.
But the offer of assistance turned
into "sorry, boys, that's the best we
can do for you," when the House
refused to remove restrictions
against the purchase of American
arms and munitions by belligerent
nations. Observers saw in the de
nial to lift the restriction a victory
for Congressmen who feared possible
Russian commercial reprisals against
too-great American aid for Finland.
The old marble corridors of the
staid capitol building rang with a
barrage of verbal warfare that
carried from the meeting room at
the close of the two-day debate
and overflowed into crowded
streets before the capitol. Non-in
terventionists who had carried the
day found themselves opposed by
less cautious members who
claimed the arms ban put an iron
clad restriction on Finnish pur
chases and left the Scandinavian
nation with the same eight-ball
staring it in the face.
Irate pro-Finnish Representatives
painted a picture in which they en
visioned grim-faced Russian sol
diers dressed in'heavy helmets and
coats —and grasping hand grenades
and submachine guns, in a ferocious
attack against the Finns—wearing
silken scanty pants and mounted on
pogo sticks.
* * *
yt/HEELHORSES in blocking the
arms bill were Speaker Wil
liam B. Bankhead and Majority
Leader Sam Rayburn. Their action
was termed the result of a personal
charge from President Roosevelt to
deflect amendments not compatible
with the neutrality law and the
President's war-time defense proc
lamations. Roosevelt is expected to
sign the bill soon after he returns
from his vacation.
House action on the measure came
as the crest of a rising tide of pro-
Finnish and anti-Russian sentiment,
all now dry-docked, which aimed at
the opening of the American arms
market to Finland.
Almost entirely forgotten in
the maze of oratory was the inclu
sion of China in the loan bill.
Japanese representatives, however,
expressed resentment and said the
Tokyo government would be
forced to take proper measures if
American "oppression" contin
ued.
The bill increased capital for loan
purposes by $100,000,000, and em
powers discretional loans not ex
ceeding one-fifth of that amount.
Loanable funds are reported avail
able immediately, not only to Fin
land and China, but also to neutrals
such as Sweden, Norway, Denmark,
and several South American coun
tries.
To the non-aggressor nations of
Finland and China will go the full
$20,000,000 credits allowed by the
bill. This sum will be in addition to
previous grants which gave Finland
$10,000,000, and China $25,000,000.

Capitol observers, who see a pos
sible left-handed victory for the pro-

through which the Finns could or

fighters . . . "just for pleasure craft"

too-great American aid for Finland.
The old marble corridors of the
staid capitol building rang with a
barrage of verbal warfare that
carried from the meeting room at
the close of the two-day debate
and overflowed into crowded
streets before the capitol. Non-in
terventionists who had carried the
day found themselves opposed by
less cautious members who
claimed the arms ban put an iron
clad restriction on Finnish pur
chases and left the Scandinavian
nation with the same eight-ball
staring it in the face.
Irate pro-Finnish Representatives
painted a picture in which they en
visioned grim-faced Russian sol
diers dressed in'heavy helmets and
coats —and grasping hand grenades
and submachine guns, in a ferocious
attack against the Finns—wearing
silken scanty pants and mounted on
pogo sticks.

yt/HEELHORSES in blocking the
arms bill were Speaker Wil
liam B. Bankhead and Majority
Leader Sam Rayburn. Their action
was termed the result of a personal
charge from President Roosevelt to
deflect amendments not compatible
with the neutrality law and the
President's war-time defense proc
lamations. Roosevelt is expected to
sign the bill soon after he returns
from his vacation.
House action on the measure came
as the crest of a rising tide of pro-
Finnish and anti-Russian sentiment,
all now dry-docked, which aimed at
the opening of the American arms
market to Finland.
Almost entirely forgotten in
the maze of oratory was the inclu
sion of China in the loan bill.
Japanese representatives, however,
expressed resentment and said the
Tokyo government would be
forced to take proper measures if
American "oppression" contin
ued.
The bill increased capital for loan
purposes by $100,000,000, and em
powers discretional loans not ex
ceeding one-fifth of that amount.
Loanable funds are reported avail
able immediately, not only to Fin
land and China, but also to neutrals
such as Sweden, Norway, Denmark,
and several South American coun
tries.
To the non-aggressor nations of
Finland and China will go the full
$20,000,000 credits allowed by the
bill. This sum will be in addition to
previous grants which gave Finland
$10,000,000, and China $25,000,000.

Finland, China, and other needy
nations.

into "sorry, boys, that's the best we

yt/HEELHORSES in blocking the
arms bill were Speaker Wil
liam B. Bankhead and Majority
Leader Sam Rayburn. Their action
was termed the result of a personal
charge from President Roosevelt to
deflect amendments not compatible
with the neutrality law and the
President's war-time defense proc
lamations. Roosevelt is expected to
sign the bill soon after he returns
from his vacation.
House action on the measure came
as the crest of a rising tide of pro-
Finnish and anti-Russian sentiment,
all now dry-docked, which aimed at
the opening of the American arms
market to Finland.
Almost entirely forgotten in
the maze of oratory was the inclu
sion of China in the loan bill.
Japanese representatives, however,
expressed resentment and said the
Tokyo government would be
forced to take proper measures if
American "oppression" contin
ued.
The bill increased capital for loan
purposes by $100,000,000, and em
powers discretional loans not ex
ceeding one-fifth of that amount.
Loanable funds are reported avail
able immediately, not only to Fin
land and China, but also to neutrals
such as Sweden, Norway, Denmark,
and several South American coun
tries.
To the non-aggressor nations of
Finland and China will go the full
$20,000,000 credits allowed by the
bill. This sum will be in addition to
previous grants which gave Finland
$10,000,000, and China $25,000,000.

|>OSSIBLE joker in the deck will
be revealed next week when the
Senators confer on an amendment
proposed by their brother represen
tatives which, if passed, will au
thorize Finland to purchase Ameri
can-built airplanes for non-military
purposes in this country.
Capitol observers, who see a pos
sible left-handed victory for the pro-
Finnish leaders, foretold loopholes
through which the Finns could or
der Douglas bombers and Vultee
fighters . . . "just for pleasure craft"
. . . then arm the planes after ar
rival for use against the Russian en
forces.
At an)' rate, an unarmed army
plane would do the Finns a darn'
sight more good than a pogo stick
. . . even if the pogo stick had syn
chronized machine guns mounted on
(he handle.
