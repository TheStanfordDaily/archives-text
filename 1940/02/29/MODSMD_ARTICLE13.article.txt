# Canoe Disappears For Second Time
## 
### 
The Phi Sigma Kappa canoe,
lost in the San Francisqiiito rapids
Tuesday, was found this morning
about 100 yards downstream from
the point where it tipped over—
but when the Phi Sigs went over
to the creek at 5 o'clock to pick
it up, it had disappeared again.
II was believed to have been
stolen, since the flood waters had
not damaged it beyond repair.
When found, the canoe was bent
half around a tree but was not
broken seriously.
Al Zadig, one of the canoeists
who was tipped out into the creek
yesterday, and Ed Rodgcrs, his
rescuer, were released from the
Palo Alto Hospital this morning,
