# 'HALF DON'T SMOKE' Student Poll Shows Farm Percentage
## 
### JANET GOULD 
Offer a Stanford student a cigar
ette—and the scientifically computed
chances are fifty-fifty that he or she
will refuse.
For the "I don't smoke" contin
gent on the Farm is made up of
exactly 47 per cent of the men, and
53 per cent of the women on cam
pus, it was announced yesterday in
a press release from Dick Stepp,
publicity chairman for the first-year
students in the Graduate School of
Business who are completing work
on a Bawlout-wide survey of just
how many students at Stanford do
and don't use tobacco.
Ray Hill is director of the poll
which has been a statistical exercise
for 100 students in the graduate
school.
CIGARETTES MOST USED
Of the 2,100 persons filling out the
smoking questionnaires distributed
recently, 76 per cent of the men
smokers use cigarettes, 26 per cent
smoke pipes as well as cigarettes,
and 9 per cent puff cigars "on occa
sion."
The women smokers reported us
ing cigarettes exclusively.
The preliminary check, which has
been made by Dwight Zook, chair
man of the tabulations committee,
showed that the percentage of stu
dents who smoke increases with
each class, and in general with cor
responding increases in the age of
the students.
Tlie findings, Zook declared, are

accurate and dependable.
"In addition to our extensive cov
erage with over 2,100 returns," he
explained, "our sample has the same
proportions of the men and women
smokers of the different classes and
nearly the same ages as arc en
rolled in the University. We even
checked the proportion of students
owning cars and of those working
part time.
"We found some shortage in the
oldest age group and in off-campus
residents, but otherwise our sample
is nearly perfect," he declared.
Professor Robert F. Martin, lec
turer in the Graduate School of Bus
iness, and general chairman of the
survey, declared earlier that the
students' methods were as accurate
as any commercial survey, and that
the workers had avoided the pit
falls and inaccuracies which nor
mally would throw off professional
statisticians' figures.
DIGEST MISSES
He cited particularly the failure
of the Literary Digest poll in 1936
to get a representative sample of
voters in its prophecy as to the win
ner of the presidential campaign.
By next week, it was declared,
Zook will have finished computing
results from the questionnaires on
a tabulating machine brought to
Stanford for use on the survey, and
will be able to give information
concerning the brands of tobacco
used by the students.

used by the students.
Offer a Stanford student a cigar
ette—and the scientifically computed
chances are fifty-fifty that he or she
will refuse.
For the "I don't smoke" contin
gent on the Farm is made up of
exactly 47 per cent of the men, and
53 per cent of the women on cam
pus, it was announced yesterday in
a press release from Dick Stepp,
publicity chairman for the first-year
students in the Graduate School of
Business who are completing work
on a Bawlout-wide survey of just
how many students at Stanford do
and don't use tobacco.
Ray Hill is director of the poll
which has been a statistical exercise
for 100 students in the graduate
school.
CIGARETTES MOST USED
Of the 2,100 persons filling out the
smoking questionnaires distributed
recently, 76 per cent of the men
smokers use cigarettes, 26 per cent
smoke pipes as well as cigarettes,
and 9 per cent puff cigars "on occa
sion."
The women smokers reported us
ing cigarettes exclusively.
The preliminary check, which has
been made by Dwight Zook, chair
man of the tabulations committee,
showed that the percentage of stu
dents who smoke increases with
each class, and in general with cor
responding increases in the age of
the students.
Tlie findings, Zook declared, are

accurate and dependable.
"In addition to our extensive cov
erage with over 2,100 returns," he
explained, "our sample has the same
proportions of the men and women
smokers of the different classes and
nearly the same ages as arc en
rolled in the University. We even
checked the proportion of students
owning cars and of those working
part time.
"We found some shortage in the
oldest age group and in off-campus
residents, but otherwise our sample
is nearly perfect," he declared.
Professor Robert F. Martin, lec
turer in the Graduate School of Bus
iness, and general chairman of the
survey, declared earlier that the
students' methods were as accurate
as any commercial survey, and that
the workers had avoided the pit
falls and inaccuracies which nor
mally would throw off professional
statisticians' figures.
DIGEST MISSES
He cited particularly the failure
of the Literary Digest poll in 1936
to get a representative sample of
voters in its prophecy as to the win
ner of the presidential campaign.
By next week, it was declared,
Zook will have finished computing
results from the questionnaires on
a tabulating machine brought to
Stanford for use on the survey, and
will be able to give information
concerning the brands of tobacco
used by the students.
