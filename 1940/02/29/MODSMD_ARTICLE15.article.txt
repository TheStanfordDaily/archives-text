## 
### 
Moral support for the Allies in the present European war was asked
yesterday by Dr. I). Elton Trucblood, University chaplain.
The chaplain condemned the attitude that "It is not our war"—an alti
tude he said is growing in America today.
Addressing the weekly session of Luncheon Club, Dr. Trucblood spoke

,overtime, giving no opportunity for
questions from his audience. He in
vited any who disagreed with him
and others interested to a gather
ing at his home Sunday night at 8
o'clock.
PUTS BLAME ON NAZIS
Full blame for the present war —
for events since 1933, at least—must
be placed upon the German Nazi
party, said Dr. Trucblood, who de
clared repeatedly the time has come
for America to pronounce moral
judgment.
"The United States is partly to
blame for the war, because we stood
off at the end of the first World War
and refused to help Europe make a
lasting peace," he said.
EXPLAINS GERMAN STRATEGY
Quoting from Hitler's "Mein
Kampf," the chaplain explained
Germany's process of defeating its
enemies, notably Poland, by under
mining their strength and propa
gandizing their leaders.
He cited recent newspaper com
ments unfavorable to England as
evidence that Hitler may be suc
ceeding already in the beginning of
! a campaign to bring American
i democracy to an end and the United
! States to his aid.
Dr. Trucblood emphasized the fact
1 he spoke as a moral philosopher, not
! a political scientist.
TALKED TO PRISONERS
"The easy way is for us to say it's
j none of our affair," he said. "But
j this is a world in which we must
! make moral judgments, which are
i hard to make but nevertheless nec
j essary."
The chaplain described the Nazi
party as "so dreadful we hardly can
I imagine it." He told of conversations
: with former prisoners in Nazi con-
I centration camps.
i Twice during the talk, Dr. True
: blood declared himself a pacifist.
