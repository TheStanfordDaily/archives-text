# Chimes Ring Quarter Hour For 40 Years

### JEFF LITTLEBOY 
People who have cherished the
thought of jimmying up the Stan
ford chime-clock that rears its squat
frame back of the Memorial Church
had better let it die a-borning.
It'd be an awful job to rearrange
four small cast iron wheels which
actuate four rods which, in turn,
actuate four bell hammers, just to
make it play "How Dry I Am" in
stead of its time-honored Westmin
ster cadence.
The clock has been banging out its
quarter-hourly messages since ap
proximately 1901, when it was orig
inally installed atop the old Memo
rial Church. When the earthquake
of 1906 jolted the campus, it calmly
rode the seismological waves and
didn't even fall.
However, under the campus re
habilitation program, it was re
moved to the basement of the old
power house in 1906. It stayed there,
in what, is now the Mechanical En
gineering power lab, until about
1908. From that time until 1914 it
hid its bronze face in the campus
basements performing the not very
glamorous function of ringing the
class bells.
In 1915 it was placed in its present
little niche back of Memorial
Church, where it has been rapping
out its brazen notes ever since.
The heart of the entire contrap
tion is a little Telechron motor about
the size of a saucer, which operates
