# Chimes Ring Quarter Hour For 40 Years
## 
### JEFF LITTLEBOY 
People who have cherished the
thought of jimmying up the Stan
ford chime-clock that rears its squat
frame back of the Memorial Church
had better let it die a-borning.
It'd be an awful job to rearrange
four small cast iron wheels which
actuate four rods which, in turn,
actuate four bell hammers, just to
make it play "How Dry I Am" in
stead of its time-honored Westmin
ster cadence.
The clock has been banging out its
quarter-hourly messages since ap
proximately 1901, when it was orig
inally installed atop the old Memo
rial Church. When the earthquake
of 1906 jolted the campus, it calmly
rode the seismological waves and
didn't even fall.
However, under the campus re
habilitation program, it was re
moved to the basement of the old
power house in 1906. It stayed there,
in what, is now the Mechanical En
gineering power lab, until about
1908. From that time until 1914 it
hid its bronze face in the campus
basements performing the not very
glamorous function of ringing the
class bells.
In 1915 it was placed in its present
little niche back of Memorial
Church, where it has been rapping
out its brazen notes ever since.
The heart of the entire contrap
tion is a little Telechron motor about
the size of a saucer, which operates
the hands. The chimes are powered I
by a big weight, operating in the !
same manner as the weights in a I
grandfather clock. The electric mo- !
tor still operates the class bells.
The electrical engineering lab, j
foreseeing an almost certain con- \
tingency, built a six-tube amplifier
which cuts in dry battery power !
when the University power fails. If j
both ever fail, the old pendulum that '
used to operate it. in the old days is j
still attached to the motor frame of
the clock.
The chimes and various other I
gadgets are under the care of four I
men—two alternate night watchmen
and two electricians from the cor
poration yard, who see that the
chimes are turned off at. 10:30 at
night and on again at 7:30 in thf !
morning. There is a cam-and-lever j
arrangement that chokes the clangor i
of class beils for Sunday peace and
quiet.
So, when your girl tells you she
lay awake in the wee small hours
thinking of you and hearing the
clock strike the hours, you'll know ,
what to believe—or will you?
