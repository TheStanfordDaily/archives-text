# Sacramento River Pours Over Levees
## WPA Gives $10,000 For Flood Relief As 4,000 Homeless 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Feb. 2H
(UP). â€” The Sacramento River
poured over the tops of its levees
along a 100-mile front tonight,
leaving 4.000 persons homeless
with damage running into millions
of dollars.
Although a four-day downpour
has dwindled to sporadic showers,
every stream in northern Califor
nia bulged with flood waters that
had taken at least two lives.
The Sacramento, gathering from
the mountain streams near the Ore
gon line, sent a deadly flood cours
ing down its huge, rich valley and
spilling over the levees to farmlands
and cities.
ABOVE FLOOD STAGE
The crest gathered at Kennett, in
the foothills where several rivers
join to a single channel. The river
went to 37 feet, far above flood
stage and higher than any recorded
level.
At Redding, a few miles to the
south, Mayor Joseph R. Sober pro
claimed a state of emergency as the
crest passed all records and made
800 homeless. The Red Cross and
American Legion fed and housed the
refugees. The new Redding water
plant was flooded with nine feet of
water, threatening pumping facili
ties.
Governor Culbert L. Olson tonight
announced WPA had appropriated
$10,000 for emergency flood relief
and he has asked Washington for a
total allocation of $100,000.
WPA WILL HELP
State Engineer Edward Hyatt said
by tomorrow there would be 650
WPA employees available to patrol
levees.
Tomorrow's forecast for the San
Francisco Bay Region is for
clearing weather with showers in
the morning; Friday unsettled; de
creasing southwest wind; moderate
temperature.
In Berkeley, Strawberry Creek
burst a culvert and flooded the
northern section of the city, causing
an estimated $100,000 damage to 20
stores. The Reid Pharmacy lost, most
of its stock in the flood, with loss
estimated at $25,000. Martinez had
a "flash flood" after a cloudburst.
RESORT HOMES LOST
The Russian River, which runs to
the sea north of San Francisco Bay,
ripped out resort properties and
summer homes. An accurate check
of the Guerneville and Monte Rio
area was prevented because com
munications were cut off.
The State Highway Department
estimated a $500,000 loss. U. S. 99,
the main inland route to Oregon,
was blocked on both sides of Red
ding by slides, high water and
washed-out bridges. U. S. 101, the
coast route, was cut at three places
between Santa Rosa and Eureka.
High water and slides also crippled
many other main highway arteries,
particularly in the lower Sacramento
Valley.
The main railroad lines from Cali
fornia to Oregon also were sevei-ed
in the Redding area. Trains were
rerouted by way of Reno and the
Alturas cut-off.
