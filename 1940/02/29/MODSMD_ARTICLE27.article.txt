iiekkekt was founder
The A.S.C.AP., which controls the
fund, was founded in 1914 by Vic
tor Herbert, America's great com
poser of romantic music, as an ag
ency for the protection of music
copyrights. His successors, now
numbering 1,200, hope this competi
tion may reveal creative talent that
mitfht otherwise be overlooked.
In keeping with the principles of
the organization, there is strict pro
vision that all lights inherent in the
competing works shall remain the
property of the creators. A.S.C.A.P.
will submit the winning entries to
theatrical and motion picture pro
ducers.
students must file
The entire country is divided into
eight zones for the award of the
fellowships. California is grouped
with Arizona, New Mexico, and Ne
vada.
Students intending to compete are
required to file advance notice, giv
ing details of the proposed work,
which may be an original musical
play, musical comedy, opera, light
opera, operetta, or musical revue.
To qualify, the work must be pro
duced before an audience of at least
200. The deadline is May 1 and de
cisions will be reached by May 15.
FACULTY TO JUDGE
A board of judges will be selected
from college faculties in each of the
< regions. Their judgments will
lie final. II in their estimation the
entries lack sufficient merit, they
may withhold the award.
A.S.C.A.P. stresses the importance
of practicality with a view to ulti
mate commercialization on stage or
screen and the value of America's
traditions and native lore as a pos
sible source fit' both comedy and
tragedy.
