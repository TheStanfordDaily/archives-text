# Injured Williams Tabbed Doubtful Starter Friday
## 
### 
There is still doubt in the mind of Coach Everett Dean as to whether
or not his ace forward. Don Williams, will be in shape to start Friday
night's crucial game with California.
Williams, who twisted his knee in a Hurry under the offensive back
board last Tuesday, worked out only lightly with the other first stringers

yesterday. If his knee has not
sufficiently by Friday, he will be re
placed by Leon Lafaille.
SHORT PRACTICE
Dean sent his regulars coasting
through a 40-minute practice ses
sion at only half throttle. The team
appeared as fresh as possible and
with a lay-off today and tomorrow
they should be in top condition for
the two grueling games this week
end.
The first stringers: Ken Davidson |
and Bill Cowden at guards, Dick
Taylor and Bob Penn working at
center, Leon Lafaille, Don Williams,
and Fordy Anderson at forwards,
showed their old fire at offensive
practice. A second string consisting
of Tiff Denton and Frank Wells at
forwards, John Alltucker at center, j
and Gil Rahn and Bob Wensel at
guards outscrimmaged a bunch of
reserves 8-6.
CRUCIAL GAME
Friday night's tilt will be a crucial
one for the Cards. For California j
will be back from the south and j
still feeling the sting of their second â– 
beating at the hands of a scraggly
L'.C.L.A. quintet. Also they will be j
playing in their home court, which 1
usually gives them a large psycho
logical margin over the invaders, j
And lastly, they can capture-second ;
place in the conference if they drop
the Indians twice.
But Everett Dean's charges have
come through tougher tests than
this with Hying colors. With con
fidence built from their brilliant
showing against the mighty men of
Troy this last week-end, they
should erase the memory of their
last game with Cal. Friday night
should be a repetition of that night
back in January when the Indians j
met the Bears for the first time and
smothered those Cal cagers 55-32.
