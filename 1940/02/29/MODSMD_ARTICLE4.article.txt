Elliot G. Reid. professor of aero
dynamics, who spoke on the Stan
ford hour last night, said that the
safety, reliability, and performance
of aircraft, and the reduction of the
manufacturing costs are the prin
cipal objectives of modern aeronau
tical research.
The subject of Professor Reid's
talk was "Aeronautical Research on
the West Coast." He said that Stan
ford has been engaged in this re
search for 24 years.
He spoke of the apparatus and
methods used in testing by research
engineers, and explained that Stan
ford's location near Sunnyvale is
particularly valuable to students of
aeronautical engineering.
