PACIFIC COAST CONFERENCE
legislation early this year, which
was careful to put more teeth in
the existing rules regarding the re
cruitment of athletes and aid after
enrollment, has met with a snag—a
misinterpretation.
In a few days Edwin N. Ather
ton. P.C.C. commissioner of ath
letics. hopes to have a bulletin in
tin hands of junior colleges, high
schools, and active alumni de- j
signed to interpret the amended ;
rules. However, he has yet to j
hear from several of the five men i
en the committee ot the commis
sioner.
Atherton presented the bulletin to
the committee to get their inter
pretation on the rule regarding the
period of grace granted the mem
bers', before the- rules on the re
cruiting of athletes went into effect.

ANY COMMITMENTS MADE un
der the old rule and in effect at the
time of the amendments aren't to
be affected. Thus any promises
made to the ace backfield man will
be kept, and any arrangements made
to a high school athlete not yet en
rolled but made before the new
ruling are to be recognized.
It was the idea of some—and
not Atherton's—that the period of
graee after Jan. 4. 1940, was to
last until June. Their idea was
that that period would he an "open
season" on athletes when they
could make any number of last
minute offers.
It isn't logical to enact legisla
tion designed to curtail these prac
tices, and then turn around and al
low a wholesale corraling and stock
ing up of good athletes. It would
look rather silly. It seems that two
are holding out for the above inter
pretation.

ONLY A QUESTION of time re
mains before other conferences and
independent schools will be adopting
the same program as those in the
P.C.C.. Atherton contends.
The best evidence of that is the
new constitution adopted by the Na
tional Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion in their meeting after the
P.C.C. conclave.
"It is patterned along the same
general lines of legislation of this
conference, and it shows how oth
er colleges are thinking. They
hope to take the emphasis off foot
ball and safeguard it as a game,"
Atherton explained.
Professor W. B. Owens of the
Staj lford law school and in his

fourth year as president of the
N.C.2A. was instrumental in putting
the new legislation over.

TRIAL AND ERROR method will
be used in working out the details of
his new office. Some rules will have
to be strengthened, and others will
have to be modified to meet rising
conditions.
Atherton figures on about two
to three years before the new ma
chinery will be functioning satis
factorily. Asked if he expected a
great deal of trouble from active
alumni, he said that there will al
ways be a minority hard to control.
His "report" which was aired at
the P.C.fc. meeting last month, has
the names of alumni and others who
supported athletes in the past. There
fore, he figures it won't be as diffi
cult to pick out violators of the new
code. *

THE BEAUTY OF ALL these eli
gibility rules is that an athlete may
be ruled out no matter what length
of time has elapsed since an infrac
tion of the new legislation.
