THE United Press says there's more rain on
the way. After that brie! sunny interlude
yesterday, everyone is concerned. Frank Sulli
van's friend, the cliche expert Mr. Arbuthnot,
was in the Shack yesterday when it first started
to rain.
He didn't have much to say about the Euro
pean war. No, the war dropped out of polite
conversation yesterday. The Finns can stage
their last-ditch stand in the ice-ripped rim of
the Arctic Circle and wary scouting parties of
French troops can snoop along the Westwall.
It was all right with Mr. Arbuthnot—and the
world was not interested in any war yesterday.
America was back to normal. The weather,
the dear, tired and always-present weather had
returned to its former spot at the top of con
versational lists.
"Let's talk about the weather," Mr. Arbuthnot
said. "Remember what Mark Twain said?" Be
fore I had time to flee, he continued. " 'Every
body talks about the weather but nobody does
anything about it.'"
Determined to halt further conversational
bromides, I parried with a hackneyed descrip
tion of Stanford in the rain—the library parking
lot, its usual quagmire, the two black-hearted
motorists who drenched me as I walked from
the Union to the Press Building, unable to find
even elementary shelter in the sparse bushes
that grow between the sidewalk and the wall. I
was just droning on about the request I'd sent
the Coast Guard for assistance and their reply
to "buy a pair of water wings," when I noticed
that Arbuthnot was no longer there.
I saw him vanish into a cloud of mist outside
the door of the Shack.—D. H.
