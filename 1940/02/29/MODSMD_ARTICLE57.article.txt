# Hot Trumpet Solo

D. H. and his good friend, Arbuthnot, have
established beyond much doubt that this
rainy weather is a bad time to jump on poor,
downtrodden Congressman Dies, or the mildly
uproarious California Legislature, or even the
current festivities in Europe. This is sleepy
weather, the kind of day when we like to listen
to the rain on the roof and dream of what all
these pennies from Heaven will mean to the
Farm's social spring guarter. Spring guarters
are those eleven-week affairs that make the
junior transfers wish they had come to Stan
ford as freshmen.
Spring guarter also brings the campus' big
gest all-University dance â€” the Junior Prom.
And that reminds us of a sun-tanned orchestra
leader named Fletcher Henderson who played
piano in his own band a couple of years ago in
the most successful campus dance in a decade.
The dingy Pavilion was sold out days before the
date of the prom. Staid and social Stanfordites
whistled and hooted from 11 to 1 o'clock in
order to get the dark horn blowers to play 'em
fast and rhythmic. Nothing has ever superseded
the affair in the memories of those who were
there.
The current junior class committees, them
selves feeling the social urge of a wet day, have
started looking for bands suitable for the affair.
Undoubtedly they do not want to lose as much
money as the senior class did on their recent
fiasco. Precedent would seem to establish the
fact that the elite group hereabouts will jump
and jive with the rest of them if given a little
incentive.
All this chatter, of course, is just a passing
hint to a committee just started to work that
Stanford wants a change from the society bands
of the past two years. After all, we can hear
sweet and romantic airs any night in the City,
for a lot less than the three-buck dun usually
charged on the campus.
And those of us whose "Feet's Too Big" will
just stand up front and listen.
