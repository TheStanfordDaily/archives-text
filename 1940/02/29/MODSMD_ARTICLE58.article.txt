## RHAPSODY IN BLACK

r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
Attention was called in a recent letter to the
Negro's contribution to American culture. I wish to
record my complete agreement with the writer and
supplement his remarks concerning Negro musicians.
Our nation is fortunate and proud to have so great
a quartet of singers as Dorothy Mayor, "The Ameri
can Flagstad.'' Marian Anderson, Roland Hayes, and
Paul Robeson. Thr percentage of Negroes who sing
is astonishingly hit{h and Negro choral groups have
achieved signal success as witnessed by the Fisk Jubi

lee Singers, the Marion Herby Chums, the Hall John
son Choir, and others.
Since the begninings of American minstrelsy, one
of our foremost indigenous culture patterns, the Negro
has distinguished himself in theatrical music. A vast
racial vitality is to be found in "Green Pastures," "Run
Little Chillun," the great American folk opera, "Porgy
and Bess," and "John Henry," now opening on Broad
way.
* ♦ * *
roster is not limited to entertainers. Creative
artists of the first magnitude have added to the
rapidly growing list of significant American compo
sitions. A few of these are Henry Burleigh, Nathaniel
Dett, Clarence White, Henry Freeman, Rosamund John
son, and William Grant Still, not to mention Duke El
lington, Cab Calloway, Louis Armstrong and the host
of Negro musicians in the popular field.
Fortunately the lot of the Negro is steadily im
proving, due, I'm afraid, more to his own efforts than
our. Hampered at every turn by social and economic
discrimination, the American Negro has infused cul
tural life blood into a society that, for the most part,
has held him in contempt.
