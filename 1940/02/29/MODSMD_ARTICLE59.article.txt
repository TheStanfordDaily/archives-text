A LIBERAL EDUCATION
r |' , HERE is an intriguing book out, "A New Design
for Women's Education"—written by President
Constance Warren of Sarah Lawrence College for the
future of education and two dollars a copy. Miss War
ren is the head of a "laboratory college," which is
seeking to eliminate "the lag between education and
the dynamic content of life."
The dynamic content of life, of course, takes in
quite a few things that college doesn't. Sarah Law
rence may eventually have to make its curricula both
liberal and libertine.
Aside from this elusive generality about keeping up
with life, however, some of President Warren's sug
gestions sound promising. The thesis of her book is
that modern universities have too many sacred cows
that need sacrificing. Among these holy domestic ani
mals is the rigiditj' of prescribed courses.
Miss Warren believes that students are capable of
choosing their own programs. That may be going a
little too far. Some of us might have been taking 15
unifs of puppetry, badminton, and social tactics if we
had been left to our own devices.
But there certainly is some truth in the criticism
of the assorted scholastic requirements that ax-e ir
relevant to both the careers and the interests of stu
dents. A prospective geologist, for example, may have
fairly secure grounds for wondering why he must
take over three years of two different languages.

OUT one of the most wasteful elements in our edu
cational system is the false sense of progress that
has recently filled the breasts of high school educa
tors. It all started with ideas like Miss Warren's that
education was too formal. Reading, writing, and arith
metic are all right in their place, but we must broaden
our little charges into cultured human beings—this
has been the keynote of the high school's cascades of
progress. And in the strain to avoid being old-fash
ioned, many high schools are giving history survey
courses and sociology training that are usually beyond
the students —and sometimes beyond the teachers.
Creative-writing is begun in the eleventh grade—
undoubtedly a noble venture. But the blunt fact is too
often overlooked that most high school graduates can't
even write a coherent letter, even while they are learn
ing to emulate Alexander Pope.
And while universities are taking progressive sug
gestions from pioneers like the President of Sarah
Lawrence College, it might be well to take a look at
the foolish extremes which high schools have effort
lessly been able to achieve. Before the crown of cul
ture should come a reasonable head on which to wear
the crown. And before sociology, should come rela
tively fundamental things—like writing letters.
Ethel, our colored cook, has a boy in a Los Angeles
high school. He has a good deal of trouble finding the
difference of two three-digit numbers. But he has a
very good excuse. He is not studying arithmetic. He
is studying "science."
