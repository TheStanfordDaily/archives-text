### DOUG JAQUES 
AFTER SEEING GEORGE AND MARGARET
(The scene is the breakfast-room of the house.
It is breakfast time, conveniently enough, as the
curtain rises. Seated around the table are Mother,
Father,* their daughter Frankie, their two sons,
Claude and Dudley, and a guest of the family, 28-
year-old Roger.)
Frankie: What were you doing in the maid's room last
night, Claude?
Claude: Nothing, nothing at all. She had something in
her eye, that's all. I got it out for her.
Frankie: Oh yeah?
Claude: My dear sister. I am strict and honorable.
Mother: But is the maid? That's what I want to know.
Roger: I'm so shy.
Mother: Claude, did the maid seduce you?
Claude: Mother!
Father: I saw a man yesterday.
Dudley: What did he want., father?
Father: I don't know. I saw him out the window as he
was walking by.
Mother: I'm going to fire that maid.
Dudley: I am an artist, and ever so popular.
Frankie: Is there anything dirty about a bathroom?
Father: Nothing that a little oil won't fix.
Roger: I'm so shy.
Frankie: Father, I'm in love with Roger.
Father: I know, my dear. I've known all along. Any
man could tell.
Frankie: Oh, then Roger must know, too.
Father: Perhaps.
Frankie: But you said any man would know.
Father: Yes.
Frankie: Then maybe Roger isn't . ..
Roger: I'm so shy.
Claude: I am a dignified person, and you people are
immoral and have dirty minds.
Dudley: You're talking like an ass.
Claude: Don't use such dirty language.
Mother (to Father): Have you been in the bathroom
this week?
Father: Of course. Several times.
Mother: Oh.
Frankie: Where's the maid.
Dudley: In the kitchen.
Mother: What is she doing?
Dudley: She's making an egg.
Mother: Claude! Do you hear that? She's making an
egg. •
Claude: Yes. mother.
Mother: Is she making it for you? »
Claude: Yes, mother.
Mother: Oh.
Father: Claude is in love.
Mother: With the maid?
Father (smugly): I've known it all the time.
Roger: I'm so shy. Kiss me, darling.
