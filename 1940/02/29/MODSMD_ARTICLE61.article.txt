# 'Front Page' Rehash Rated Swell Comedy
## 
### 
"His Girl Friday," now playing at
the Stanford.
Frankly, when we first heard about
this picture, we were upset. The
idea of a re-make of "The Front
Page" with a girl, even if she was
Rosalind Russell, playing the part of
Hildy Johnson, sacred to the mem
ory of Lee Tracy and Pat O'Brien
enraged all our theatrical sensi
bilities.
We considered the thing no less
sacrilegious than the Shirley Temple
version of "Wee Willie Winkie."
But it's all right. As a matter of
fact, it's swell. They've changed the
set of the protagonist, but the hard
boiled, tough - talking newspaper
story is still there.
AUTHORS' TRIBUTE
Hecht and Mac Arthur's story is
admittedly a tribute to their hectic
days on the Chicago Tribune, gone,
but wistfully remembered by many
an old-time newspaperman.
"His Girl Friday," too, admits in a
sly little program note that this
sort of thing no longer takes place.
Then the show turns to and lets its
audience in on one of the fastest,
brightest comedies of the year.
GRANT PLAYS M.E.
Cary Grant, as the managing edi
tor, with a complete dearth of any
emotions or morals which are not
directly concerned with the news
paper business, has his best part
since "Gunga Din."
For sophisticated, adult comedy,
there are few actresses who can beit
Rosalind Russell. It is her per
formance of Hildy which makes the
turn-about part acceptable.
GOOD TEAM-WORK
Particularly good are the scenes
in the press room at the city hall,
in which the easy team-work of
such experienced actors as Roscoe
Karns, Cliff Edwards, Gene Lock
hart, and several more of the men
you see all the time, but whose
names you somehow never remem
ber, is a thing of beauty.
Ralph Bellamy has been the dumb
guy the heroine turns to when her
real love fizzles, for so long now,
that you can practically call each of
his facial expressons in turn, but
he's still funny, and as the little
street-walker who loves the crimi
nal, Helen Mack makes a minor part
memorable.
If either Hecht or Mac Arthur were
dead, they would have no call to
turn over in their graves; as both of
them are still among the quick, they
are probably collecting royalty
checks without a qualm in the
world.—Nowell

"His Girl Friday," now playing at
the Stanford.
Frankly, when we first heard about
this picture, we were upset. The
idea of a re-make of "The Front
Page" with a girl, even if she was
Rosalind Russell, playing the part of
Hildy Johnson, sacred to the mem
ory of Lee Tracy and Pat O'Brien
enraged all our theatrical sensi
bilities.
We considered the thing no less
sacrilegious than the Shirley Temple
version of "Wee Willie Winkie."
But it's all right. As a matter of
fact, it's swell. They've changed the
set of the protagonist, but the hard
boiled, tough - talking newspaper
story is still there.
AUTHORS' TRIBUTE
Hecht and Mac Arthur's story is
admittedly a tribute to their hectic
days on the Chicago Tribune, gone,
but wistfully remembered by many
an old-time newspaperman.
"His Girl Friday," too, admits in a
sly little program note that this
sort of thing no longer takes place.
Then the show turns to and lets its
audience in on one of the fastest,
brightest comedies of the year.
GRANT PLAYS M.E.
Cary Grant, as the managing edi
tor, with a complete dearth of any
emotions or morals which are not
directly concerned with the news
paper business, has his best part
since "Gunga Din."
For sophisticated, adult comedy,
there are few actresses who can beit
Rosalind Russell. It is her per
formance of Hildy which makes the
turn-about part acceptable.
GOOD TEAM-WORK
Particularly good are the scenes
in the press room at the city hall,
in which the easy team-work of
such experienced actors as Roscoe
Karns, Cliff Edwards, Gene Lock
hart, and several more of the men
you see all the time, but whose
names you somehow never remem
ber, is a thing of beauty.
Ralph Bellamy has been the dumb
guy the heroine turns to when her
real love fizzles, for so long now,
that you can practically call each of
his facial expressons in turn, but
he's still funny, and as the little
street-walker who loves the crimi
nal, Helen Mack makes a minor part
memorable.
If either Hecht or Mac Arthur were
dead, they would have no call to
turn over in their graves; as both of
them are still among the quick, they
are probably collecting royalty
checks without a qualm in the
world.—Nowell
