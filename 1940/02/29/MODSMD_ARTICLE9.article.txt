# Pacifist Condemns Futility of War

Dr. Vein James, noted Quaker
pacifist, addressed the International
Relations Society yesterday after
noon on the futility of war as a
method of settling any dispute. He
condemned Chamberlain for not
having the courage to pursue his
appeasement policy and for having
reverted to war.
Ho closed with the statement that
past experience should indicate that
wars are never settled on (he battle
field and that people should demand
their governments to seek peaceful
solutions.
