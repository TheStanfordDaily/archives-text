### WILSON CANNON 
I IGHTS burned late at Number 10
Downing Street last night.
Behind drawn curtains Prime
Minister Neville Chamberlain and
members of his war-time cabinet
discussed a list of five terms which
they hoped might change the his
tory of the present day world.
The intense little group buried
themselves in the latest of a group
of recently received terms under
which the most unpredictable of dic
tators, Adolf Hitler, is purportedly
seeking an immediate armistice and
open peace negotiations with the Al
lied powers.
Grim-faced members of Brit
ain's key-group sat about a ma
hogany table in the Chamberlain
drawing room as the umbrella
carrying prime minister read aloud
the proposal which they hoped
would prove to be the first au
thentic peace plan yet offered by
the Berlin government.
But behind the mask that, hid each
statesman's feelings ran the same
thoughts. Thoughts that said that
another false-alarm —if sent from
Berlin sent only as a "sounding
board'' of British sentiment — had
been received.

SUBMITTED to the foreign office
k by Lord Tavistock, chairman of
the British council for Christian set
tlement in Europe, the proposal was
said to have reached English hands
through the German legation in
Dublin.
The proposal, which was delivered
by Tavistock to Foreign Secretary
Viscount Halifax, was said to have
received close attention in official
circles, culminating in the meeting
last night.
Halifax reportedly said he had
"no doubts as to the authenticity"
of the document. He later ex
pressed a feeling of doubt that the
terms expressed the final views of
tho German government.
Hope that the proposal may
prove genuine was further dim
med when a spokesman in Berlin
declared that he was unable to
obtain any authorization either to
deny or confirm officially the au
thenticity of the report.
But England's cabinet, in spite of
rumors which ballyhooed any au
thenticity of the proposal, continued
their concentration on the list of
terms . . . hoping only that there
might be some scrap of fact, some
working basis, within them.

r | l lIE five-point document was said
to include "{he following {errnsf
(1) Germany would grant inde
pendence to Slovakia provided that
country remains neutral.
(Occupied by Hitler in 1939 as he
moved to prove the truth of Bis
mark's statement, "The master of
Bohemia is the master of Europe."
Germany needs this outlet to neces
sary raw materials.)
(2) Germany would give a recon
stituted Poland full independence,
allowing her an outlet to the sea, in
cluding a railway line and the use
of the Vistula River.
(3) Germany might arrange a
plebiscite in Austria but regards
her relations with Austria as an
internal matter.
(Absorbed in 1938. Since then
filled with German citizens so as
to prevent any loss by a possible
plebiscite.)
(4) Germany is prepared to dis
arm, provided others do likewise.
(5) Germany is prepared to re
enter the League of Nations pro
vided the League will guarantee that
all grievances will be dealt with
fairly and not set.aside by the action
of dominant powers such as Britain
and France.
Maybe . . . the world will see
peace by spring.
