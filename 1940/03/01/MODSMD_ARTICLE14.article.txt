# Frosh Prime For Week-end Cal Cage Tilts
## Showings Establish Papooses Favorites Over Berkeley Rivals 
### JACK DALTON 
Set to make their 1939-40 season
the best in over a decade of Stan
ford history, Coach H. B. Lee's
freshman basketball team took a day
off yesterday before their supreme
effort tonight at Berkeley against
the California frosh.
Saturday night the Papoose five
winds up the schedule, meeting the
Cubs again. Both battles will be run
off at (3:30 o'clock as preliminary to
the Varsity-Cal clashes.
Three weeks ago at Berkeley, Lee's
charges barely nosed out their op
ponents 35-34 but their showings the
past two weeks have probably estab
lished Stanford as favorites. In such
emotionally-charged battles, how
ever, previous showings count for
little and the fierceness of the first,
game is expected to be duplicated
tonight.
YEARLINGS WIN 14
With 14 wins in 15 tries, the Card
yearlings can count, i>er>idos the Cal
frosh, Modesto J. C., Marin J. C.,
and George Washington High of San
Francisco among its victims, top
notch clubs all. Their only reversal
came at the hands of Menlo J. C.'s
strong array a month ago, 41-33.
With Dana in the front line to
night. will be little Freddie Linari,
a spark-plug forward with nearly
flawless floor work. Voss will open
at his usual pivot post and Lee Mc-
Caffrey and Walt Funabiki are slat
ed to hold down the guard posts.
McCaffrey's passing and backboard
work and Funabiki's tight defensive
play have stood out all year.
SUBS TO SEE ACTION
Husky Ed Stamm, first-string end
on the frosh football team last fall,
will probably be the first sub to see
action, going in for Funabiki or
Voss. Big John Eikelman, guard or
forward, and Ross Meyer, speedy
forward, will also see their share of
sub duty.
Following is the accumulative
scoring for the highest eight men
this year:
FG FT PF TP
Dana, f 66 9 12 141
Voss, c 51 9 19 111
McCaffrey, g 41 8 20 90
Linari, f 31 8 11 70
Stamm, c 25 9 18 59
