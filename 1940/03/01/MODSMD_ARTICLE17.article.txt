# Indians, Bears to Battle For Second League Spot In Last of Grudge Series
## Co-Captain Williams Still Described As 'Doubtful Starter'; Rough Game Foreseen Tonight in Berkeley Gym 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Willi or without Don Williams, hot or told, Stanford's haskclhall loam
will have to heat California's rejuvenated cagers in at least one of thi*
week-end s two names in order to maintain that second-place position in
the 1 acilic Coast Conference which they so rightfully deserve.
Tonight at Berkeley Indian meets Bear at 8 o'clock in the first of the
two games to decide the runner-up in the conference. The second game

.will be on Saturday in Stanford's
pavilion. The frosh will play a pre
liminary with Cal's frosh on lx>th
evenings, their game beginning at
G:3O.
WILLIAMS DOUBTFUL
An injured knee, it .seems, is
pretty undepcndable and unpredict
able. The latest reports .still term
Don Williams and that knee he
twisted last Tuesday as "doubtful
starters." Just in case that Williams
finds that lie can't cut and drive as
usual come game time tonight, ho
will be replaced by Loon Lafaille,
the two-handed shot artist.
Tonight's and tomorrow's tilts are
not going to be easy for Coach Ev
erett Dean and his hoopsters by any
means. That news about Cal being a
rejuvenated team is largely true.
Last week-end down at U.C.L.A. big
Bill Ogilvie, sloppy Bear center,
scored 11 and 13 points as his team
split with the Bruins. Lately he has
shown signs that he is regaining his
eye and Bob Pcnn and Dick Taylor,
the Stanford centers who will bo
guarding "Ugly O." will have to
keep their hands up and waving in
order to stop his set long shots.
SOPH HAS PUNCH
Bear Coach Nibs Price has found
a forward with scoring punch in Roy
Tamm, hefty sophomore transfer
from Marin Junior College. The
other forward starting for the Ber
keley team tonight will be either the
veteran senior, tricky Dud Morgan,
or sophomore John McGec.
Walt Bickerton, who has proved
himself to be the only dependable
performer in the Cal lineup, and
lanky Biil BiggerstafT will round out.
the Bears' starling lineup at the
guard positions.
Look for a rough and tumble game
by the Bears tonight—a game which
they play best under the protection
of their own gym and before their
8,000 rooters. While Dean's men will
use their best scoring weapon, the
fast break, as often as the opportu
nity presents itself.

Tonight's and tomorrow's tilts are
not going to be easy for Coach Ev

SOPH HAS PUNCH
Bear Coach Nibs Price has found
a forward with scoring punch in Roy
Tamm, hefty sophomore transfer
from Marin Junior College. The
other forward starting for the Ber
keley team tonight will be either the
veteran senior, tricky Dud Morgan,
or sophomore John McGec.
Walt Bickerton, who has proved
himself to be the only dependable
performer in the Cal lineup, and
lanky Biil BiggerstafT will round out.
the Bears' starling lineup at the
guard positions.
Look for a rough and tumble game
by the Bears tonight—a game which
they play best under the protection
of their own gym and before their
8,000 rooters. While Dean's men will
use their best scoring weapon, the
fast break, as often as the opportu
nity presents itself.

ball tonight and tomorrow.

Tonight at Berkeley Indian meets Bear at 8 o'clock in the first of the
two games to decide the runner-up in the conference. The second game

WILLIAMS DOUBTFUL
An injured knee, it .seems, is
pretty undepcndable and unpredict
able. The latest reports .still term
Don Williams and that knee he
twisted last Tuesday as "doubtful
