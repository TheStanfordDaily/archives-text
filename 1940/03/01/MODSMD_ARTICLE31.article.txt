## Bauer Explains Need For Modern Homes 
### 
'"It's just about time the average
citizen looks into some of these
technical problems of housing and
makes them part of his equipment,
because I don't think we can pro
ceed very much farther with them
until that has been done,'' said
Catherine Bauer, housing authority,
last night.
Miss Bauer spoke on "Housing
Standards Fit for a Democracy," ex
plaining that to a very great extent
the details of low rent and slum
clearance are decided by the voters
through the state legislatures or city
councils.
"A cheap house is very expensive
to live in,"' she stated in answer to
the common charge of too great ex
pense.
That according to a 1936 survey,
31.1 per cent of the population of
the United States lives in substand
ard dwellings, and 10.1 per cent live
in substandard dwellings which are
lacking in proper sanitary facilities
was quoted by Miss Bauer.
