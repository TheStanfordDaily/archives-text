# Flood Subsides As Storm Flees Bay Region
## Sacramento River Waters Isolate 100 at Butte City 
### 
! SAN FHANCISCO, Feb. 29 (UP).—
The flooding Sacramento River be
gan to fall tonight after breaking
levees and spending its fury on a
thinly populated section near the
center of its 250-mile course to the
sea.
Butte City, a little town of 300 '
population, was isolated when the
levees burst between Princeton and
Glenn. About 100 persons were ma- ,
rooned there while 200 others gof
out before the levees gave way to
the flood that had made approxi- i
mutely 4,000 persons homeless.
The Butte City break, however,
acted as a floodgate and relieved the
j pressure elsewhere along the river.
SI N SHINES
On the third day of the flood,
which followed a four-day down
pour, bright sunshine prevailed and
the rains were over. Colder temper
atures in the mountains stopped the
melting of snow which had poured
down into the single raging channel
of the Sacramento.
The Weather Bureau announced
yesterday:
Bay Itegion: Fair and mild but
with occasional cloudiness Fri
day and Saturday; gentle north to
east wind.
Northern California: Fair and
mild but with occasional cloudi
ness; cloudiness north portion Fri
day and Saturday and becoming
unsettled extreme north portion
Saturday; moderate northwest
wind off the coast.
LEVEES FALL
The levees in the Butte City area,
I built higher and stronger after the
floods of December, 1937, fell before
I the record-breaking flood crest and
j rich farmlands were flooded as deep
j as 12 feet. There were few buildings
j or towns in the area, however.
Workmen patrolled the levees from
j Kennett, above Redding, down to
I Sacramento. Most of the levees were
| reinforced after the 1937 flood which
caused about $7,000,000 damage.

LEVEES FALL
The levees in the Butte City area,
I built higher and stronger after the
floods of December, 1937, fell before
I the record-breaking flood crest and
j rich farmlands were flooded as deep
j as 12 feet. There were few buildings
j or towns in the area, however.
Workmen patrolled the levees from
j Kennett, above Redding, down to
I Sacramento. Most of the levees were
| reinforced after the 1937 flood which
caused about $7,000,000 damage.
