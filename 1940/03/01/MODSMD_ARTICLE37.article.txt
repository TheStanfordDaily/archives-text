## Game Draws Largest Mural Season crowd; Larson Paces Losers 
### CHES SAROYAN 
In one of the wildest, wooliest and
still the best played games of the
year the Phi Delta Theta team
knocked the powerful Alpha Tau
Omega five out of the championship
race by a 26-23 count. Both teams
fought their hearts out and thrilled
the largest and most boisterous in
tramural crowd of the season.
The game started very fast with
the A.T.O. team jumping to an early
four-point lead due to two fast
baskets by Kai Larsen and Paul
Blanton. The Phi Delts were un
daunted and led by Wilbert Ander
son fought back and held a slim 14-
13 lead at hall time.
At the start of the second half
both teams hit into a defensive
deadlock until Jack Haraway of the
losers hit a one-handed push shot
from 30 feet out. Haraway then hit
a dump shot to put A.T.O. into a 17-
14 lead. A.T.O. kept working on the
basket and stretched their lead to
21-16, at which point Paul Blanton
was ejected from the game for four
fouls.
The ejection of Blanton proved to
be the turning point of the game for,
from this point on, the Phi Delts
turned on the power, and led by the
shooting of Howard Paine, huge cen
ter, took the lead, which they never
relinquished.
For the winners the outstanding
man was Wilbert Anderson, red
headed guard. Anderson scored 10
points in the first half and added
four in the second to take high
point honors. For the loseis Kai Lar
sen turned in a brilliant perform
ance. Larsen covered the back
board like a hawk and was A.T.O.'s
highest scorer with 8 points.
In the other game of the evening
Phi Kappa Psi turned loose a well
organized outfit to take Encina 1W
into camp by a 27-22 count. The
winners started fast and led
throughout the game.
