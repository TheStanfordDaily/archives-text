# Handicap Field Dwindles to 12
## Seabiscuit Will Run If Rain Holds Off 
### 
ARCADIA, Feb. 29 (UP). — The
field for the sixth running of the
Santa Anita handicap will be drawn
tomorrow and in the opinion ol the
men who make horses their business
only 12 thoroughbreds will be sent
after the $100,000 purse when the
bell rings on Saturday.
That would be the smallest num
ber in the history of the mile-and
a-quarter gallop which has drawn as
many as 20 hoi'scs and never has
lured less than 15, but the lack of
quantity will not portend any lack
of quality. If anything, the 1940
field is better balanced than those
which have gone in years before and
its comparatively small size will
permit a truer race.
If the track is fast, here is the
field that will go: C. S. Howard's
Seabiscuit, Circle S. Ranch's Heel
fly, A. C. Taylor's Whichsee, A. A.
Baroni's Specify. J. C. Brady's War
Plumage, Valdina Farm's Viscounty,
Binglin Stable's Don Mike, Myron
Selznick.'s Can't Wait. W. L. Ranch's
Kant an, Gafier & Sattler's Wedding
Call. L. B. Mayer's Beautiful 11.
The present Italian royal family
ruled for centuries over Savoy,
which is now a part of France.
