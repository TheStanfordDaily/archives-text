# TOM BARCLAY: POLITICIAN
## Farm Professor Participates In Party Affairs 
### DICK DUDMAN 
In and out of politics, Stanford's
Professor Thomas Swain Barclay is
an alert, hard-boiled sort of person.
As an active politician he has held
numerous positions in the Demo
cratic party, having attended a score
of political conventions, national,
"state, and city, since 1904. He at
tended both national conventions in
1936—as an observer at the Republi
can gathering, as delegate from the
i Eighth Congressional District to the
! Democratic convention.
He is a member of both the Santa
I Clara County Democratic Committee
I and the State Democratic Central
j Committee.
QUICK ON TIIE TRIGGER
Moreover, he's alert and hard
i boiled in the lecture room and in his
| book-lined office in the Inner Quad,
j He watches his step even when it
i comes to granting an interview to
; The Stanford Daily, following the
j unorthodox procedure of doing the
; writing himself, and taking care to
| tell which of his frank comments
! would better be left off the record.
In the lecture room. Professor Bar
| clay presents so many first-hand ex-
I planations of political tactics that
j students sometimes think him a
j politician first, a professor second.
He says, however, that his interest
!in contemporary political affairs
j stems from the field of research he
i has selected in political science—leg
j islation and political parties, "espe
cially Congressional politics and
j parties from 1900 to 1918."
NEAR SENSATION'
Although Dr. Barclay dislikes be
j ing thought of as a "character," he
! borders at least remotely on the
i spectacular in the eyes of the 49
i men and one woman in his after
i noon class as well as those in his
' morning lectures.
Jingling some keys and small coins
: almost continuously, he speaks in a
| harsh voice, softly most of the time,
, loud and crackling when he's driving
home a conclusion. A careful dress
| er, he frequently wears a matching
bit of blue in his shirt, tie, and
j handkerchief.
No matter what he is saying, it
j always is put in maiter-of-fact
! terms.
"Probably none of you understand
| what I've just said," he will tell his
class. "Those of you who take the
course over will get it then."
THE INSIDE STORY
i "Tilden was elected, and then
i Hayes was inaugurated," he will
j say. "That is a known historical
I fact now. The Democrats probably
j stole the election and the Republi
-1 cans stole it back—we're sure of the
! last part at least."
Professor Barclay likes Stanford
students—especially those of the
last few years.
"There has been among the Stan
ford students a notable, and in my
opinion, a healthy growth of inter
est in national politics and issues,"
he declares.
It was as a college student at the
University of Missouri that Dr. Bar
clay's interest in politics first was
aroused. Born in St. Louis in "a
region of border state politics," he
attended the university.

No matter what he is saying, it

"Probably none of you understand

i "Tilden was elected, and then
i Hayes was inaugurated," he will
j say. "That is a known historical
I fact now. The Democrats probably
j stole the election and the Republi
-1 cans stole it back—we're sure of the
! last part at least."
Professor Barclay likes Stanford
students—especially those of the
last few years.
"There has been among the Stan
ford students a notable, and in my
opinion, a healthy growth of inter
est in national politics and issues,"
he declares.
It was as a college student at the
University of Missouri that Dr. Bar
clay's interest in politics first was
aroused. Born in St. Louis in "a
region of border state politics," he
attended the university.

In and out of politics, Stanford's
Professor Thomas Swain Barclay is
an alert, hard-boiled sort of person.
As an active politician he has held
numerous positions in the Demo
cratic party, having attended a score
of political conventions, national,
"state, and city, since 1904. He at
tended both national conventions in
1936—as an observer at the Republi
can gathering, as delegate from the
i Eighth Congressional District to the
! Democratic convention.
He is a member of both the Santa
