EXPENSIVE LOOKING CAMPUS I
SWEATERS NEED NOT BE EXPENSIVE
Take this new Roos slip-on for instance. *
It's knitted of a mixture of imported
I Shetland and mohair yarns, usually found
only in more expensive sweaters. This
smooth blend of yarns makes it feel
almost as soft as cashmere, and it 3 loose
knit gives it the appearance of a hand
knit sweater. We think that when you see
and touch this sweater you'll agree with
us: here is a swell sweater for college
men at a sensible w goinfc-to-sohool w price.
