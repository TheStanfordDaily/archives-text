### WILSON CANNON 
r JPHE war on the Western Front
had a birthday yesterday.
A birthday that saw no celebra
tions, no commemorative candles.
On the deadlocked Maginot - Sieg
fried Line soldiers of the Reich and
Allied forces continued to play
their parts in the grim game of
war. From Germany came only a
strongly-worded statement by Hitler
after conference with American
"Peace Ambassador" Sumner Welles.
From England, silence.
Six months ago, on Sept. 11, 1939,
England's Prime Minister Neville
Chamberlain told radio listeners
throughout a shocked world that
Britain was at war with Germany.
France followed the announcement
a few hours later with a similar
declaration. Germany had marched
on Poland two days before to set
the match to the war bomb.
A half-year has passed, and still
the world is waiting for the threat
ened "total war" that is expected to
turn the no-man's land between the
now-waiting armies into a blood
soaked arena. And persistent belief
still holds that active warfare will
break out with the advent of spring
. . . now three weeks away.
* * *
|>UT for the first half of its exist
ence, World War II has been
more a series of diplomatic wheed
lings; more sparirng for economic
superiority; more a question of
neutral rights . . . than any war is
expected to be.
The conflagration thus far has
been vastly unlike the first World
War, where, after a few months of
fighting, thousands of bodies lay on
the Western Front, and in Eastern
Germany the Russian forces were
annihilated at Tannenberg with
terrible loss of life.
Like two boxers, both aware of
their own ability but remembering
from past experience that the other
has a lethal punch, both armies
have been playing a waiting game
on the field. But at sea, in the air,
and on the economic front, the
war has been going on with no in
terruption.
Allied losses for the first six
months of the war have been esti
mated at from 3.000 to 4,000, a large
part of this number being killed at
sea. Although Germany has not an
nounced casualties, its losses are
fixed at approximately the same
amount.
In the war at sea the British have
lost almost twice as many vessels as
they did during the similar period in
1914. But although the number of
ships lost is greater, the tonnage is
much less . . . due to the Nazi at
tack upon enemy fishing craft.
"J* * *
the German claim to a
higher tempo of sinkings will
come true is a question that has kept
higher-ups in the British admiralty
worried. Berlin has already an
nounced unrestricted submarine
warfare, whereas in World War I
the under water dogs were kept
leashed until 1917.
But British counter-claims are
singing a different story. Press dis
patches from London assert that
Nazi submarines are being destroyed
much faster than they can be re
placed. Winston Churchill, first lord
of the admiralty, told interviewers
that England has mastered the mys
tery of magnetic mines to a degree
that might soon cripple the Reich
sub fleet.
And from German headquarters
come reports that submarines arc
being built at the rate of one each
day. They also claim that the
much-vaunted British convoy sys
tem is taking on the aspects of a
sieve, and point to examples of
successful "convoy cracking" as
proof.
Yes, the war had a birthday. And
the only tangible proof to newspa
per-reading Americans that, some
where in Europe there are armed
men fighting for existence are
counter-claims upon counter-claims.
They lea ve one feeling much as if
he heard the little man who wasn't
there is now using rimless spec
tacles without lenses to read be
tween the lines of the unwritten
law.

ence, World War II has been
more a series of diplomatic wheed
lings; more sparirng for economic
superiority; more a question of
neutral rights . . . than any war is
expected to be.
The conflagration thus far has
been vastly unlike the first World
War, where, after a few months of
fighting, thousands of bodies lay on
the Western Front, and in Eastern
Germany the Russian forces were
annihilated at Tannenberg with
terrible loss of life.
Like two boxers, both aware of
their own ability but remembering
from past experience that the other
has a lethal punch, both armies
have been playing a waiting game
on the field. But at sea, in the air,
and on the economic front, the
war has been going on with no in
terruption.
Allied losses for the first six
months of the war have been esti
mated at from 3.000 to 4,000, a large
part of this number being killed at
sea. Although Germany has not an
nounced casualties, its losses are
fixed at approximately the same
amount.
In the war at sea the British have
lost almost twice as many vessels as
they did during the similar period in
1914. But although the number of
ships lost is greater, the tonnage is
much less . . . due to the Nazi at
tack upon enemy fishing craft.
"J* * *
the German claim to a
higher tempo of sinkings will
come true is a question that has kept
higher-ups in the British admiralty
worried. Berlin has already an
nounced unrestricted submarine
warfare, whereas in World War I
the under water dogs were kept
leashed until 1917.
But British counter-claims are
singing a different story. Press dis
patches from London assert that
Nazi submarines are being destroyed
much faster than they can be re
placed. Winston Churchill, first lord
of the admiralty, told interviewers
that England has mastered the mys
tery of magnetic mines to a degree
that might soon cripple the Reich
sub fleet.
And from German headquarters
come reports that submarines arc
being built at the rate of one each
day. They also claim that the
much-vaunted British convoy sys
tem is taking on the aspects of a
sieve, and point to examples of
successful "convoy cracking" as
proof.
Yes, the war had a birthday. And

more a series of diplomatic wheed
lings; more sparirng for economic
superiority; more a question of
neutral rights . . . than any war is
expected to be.
The conflagration thus far has
been vastly unlike the first World
War, where, after a few months of
fighting, thousands of bodies lay on
the Western Front, and in Eastern
Germany the Russian forces were
annihilated at Tannenberg with
terrible loss of life.
Like two boxers, both aware of
their own ability but remembering
from past experience that the other
has a lethal punch, both armies
have been playing a waiting game
on the field. But at sea, in the air,
and on the economic front, the
war has been going on with no in
terruption.
Allied losses for the first six
months of the war have been esti
mated at from 3.000 to 4,000, a large
part of this number being killed at
sea. Although Germany has not an
nounced casualties, its losses are
fixed at approximately the same
amount.
In the war at sea the British have
lost almost twice as many vessels as
they did during the similar period in
1914. But although the number of
ships lost is greater, the tonnage is
much less . . . due to the Nazi at
tack upon enemy fishing craft.

the German claim to a
higher tempo of sinkings will
come true is a question that has kept
higher-ups in the British admiralty
worried. Berlin has already an
nounced unrestricted submarine
warfare, whereas in World War I
the under water dogs were kept
leashed until 1917.
But British counter-claims are
singing a different story. Press dis
patches from London assert that
Nazi submarines are being destroyed
much faster than they can be re
placed. Winston Churchill, first lord
of the admiralty, told interviewers
that England has mastered the mys
tery of magnetic mines to a degree
that might soon cripple the Reich
sub fleet.
And from German headquarters
come reports that submarines arc
being built at the rate of one each
day. They also claim that the
much-vaunted British convoy sys
tem is taking on the aspects of a
sieve, and point to examples of
successful "convoy cracking" as
proof.
Yes, the war had a birthday. And
the only tangible proof to newspa
per-reading Americans that, some
where in Europe there are armed
men fighting for existence are
counter-claims upon counter-claims.
They lea ve one feeling much as if
he heard the little man who wasn't
there is now using rimless spec
tacles without lenses to read be
tween the lines of the unwritten
law.
