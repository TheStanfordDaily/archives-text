# Finnish Cause Receives $100 From Benefit
## Other Grants Due After Investigation By Committee Ends 
### 
One hundred dollars was donated
to ex-President Herbert Hoover's
Finnish relief fund Friday by the
A.S.S.U. - appointed committee in
charge of dividing the profits of the
recent non-partisan benefit show.
At the first of a series of meetings
to decide to what groups the $300.70
collected should go, the members of
the committee unanimously voted to
give one-third of the money to the
Finns "because of the immediate
emergency need and because at
least one-third of the people who
contributed favor Finnish relief."
Only one other request for a share
of the funds was received by the
committee, a plea from the Palo
Alto Committee to Aid Agricultural
Workers. Action was postponed until
this and other non-partisan relief
agencies can be investigated.
Among depositories for the re
maining $200 which were considered
was the American Friends Service
Committee, an agency devoted to
giving humanitarian relief to civil
ians of all nations suffering from the
war. Carlen Pickett, head of this
group, will be interviewed when he
visits the campus this week.
Members of the committee to di
vide the proceeds of the benefit are
Professor Edgar Eugene Robinson,
head of the history department, Dr.
D. Elton Trueblood, University
chaplain, John Cobbs, student man
ager, and Larry Livingston, former
Daily editor and chairman of the
Peace Council.
