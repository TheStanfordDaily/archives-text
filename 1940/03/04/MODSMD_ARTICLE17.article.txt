# State Board Authorizes Grant for Construction Of El Camino Underpass
## University Avenue Will Be Raised Over Highway in Cloverleaf Plan; New Construction to Start in June 
### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
Authorizing an appropriation of $7H,000, (he California Highway Com
mission last Friday made possible (he immediate construction of tiic Uni
versity Avenue-Kl Camino Ileal underpass.
I alo Alto will add $92,000 in gasoline ta\ funds for two hienniums to
complete the financing of the project, it was revealed.
Announcement of the appropriation followed swiftly on the heels of a
conference between Palo Alto civic leaders. Acting Comptroller J. Hugh

, Jackson, Assistant Comptroller Al
fred L. Trowbridge, and the High
way Commission in Sacramcnto last
Friday.
TWO UNDERPASSES
At Friday's conference, represent
atives of the University, the Palo
Alto city council, and the board of
public works petitioned the Com
mission for construction of the high
way job so that it might be built
at the same time the railroad under
pass is being installed, thereby mak
ing possible a considerable saving,
since dirt needed to fill the track bed
can be transported ea.sily from the
excavation of the highway.
According to Dean Jackson, exca
vation of the site may begin by June
1. Meanwhile, state engineers are
completing the working plans for the
underpass. Construction should oc
cupy four or five months, Jackson
indicated. This would mean that the
project may be completed by late
October, he said.
EL t AMINO LOWERED
Preliminary plans show Univer
sity Avenue elevated about one foot
at the intersection and El Camino
Real depressed, at a gradient of two
per cent, to pass underneath Uni
versity.
El Camino's dip under Palm Drive
would occupy a distance of 1,600
feet, extending from the present
hospital road 1o a point approxi
mately opposite the city's corporation
yard. Before construction can begin,
however, engineers must design pos
sible side roads to accommodate the
traffic that normally crosses the
present intersection, the busiest
cross street from San Francisco to
San Jose.
CLOVERLEAF PLANNED
Early plans which have been
drawn up indicate that the high
way will have two 36-foot roadways,
separated by a curbed strip six feet,
wide. University Avenue will be
continued from the railroad under
pass, already begun, with two 25-
foot roads and a six-foot separation
strip. One-way side roads giving
access to the University grounds
would parallel the highway, serv
ing as what engineers describe as
an elongated "clover-leaf" pattern.
Four acres of land, valued at ap
proximately $20,000, will be donated
by the University to complete the
right-of-way, according to Dean
Jackson.
