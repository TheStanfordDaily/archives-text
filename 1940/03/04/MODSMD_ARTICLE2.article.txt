# Mlle. Curie To Lecture Tonight, 8:30
## Biographer to Speak On 'Radium Magic'; Tells Mother's Life 
### 
Eve Curie, biographer, journalist,
pianist, will lecture here tonight at
8:30 o'clock in Memorial Hall. Her
lecture, entitled "The Magic of Ra
dium," is sponsored by the A.S.S.U.
Known throughout the United
Stales for her biography of her
mother, the Nobel prize winning dis
coverer of radium, Mile. Curie added
lecturing to a long list of accom
plishments last year. Her popularity
as a speaker was such that she was
granted a leave of absence from
her position with the French gov
ernment to make a return trip to
the United States this year.
NOT SCIENTIST
Mile. Curie, unlike her mother and
her sister, is not a scientist. As a
young girl, she studied chemistry
and physics, but she soon abandoned
research for the concert stage, as a
pianist, and for writing. She has
written music criticism, and adapted
American plays for the Paris stage.
Her most notable literary accom
plishment is her biography of her
mother, Marie Curie, which topped
best-seller lists for over a year. A
human and authentic memoir, it
gives a picture of the self-abnegat
ing scientist of whom the world
knew little outside her scientific ac
complishments.
DISCOVERY OF RADIUM
Mile. Curie remembers her
famous parent, not as the discov
erer of radium, but as a mother. She
recalls the privations and hardships
that Madame Curie endured in or
der to carry on her research.
The isolation of radium made
possible its use for medical science
and for commercial purposes. Since
the first gram of the rare element
was extracted from pitchblende resi
due, science has constantly found
new uses for it.
The story of the discovery and
subsequent uses of radium will be
told by Eve Curie in her lecture to
night. Tickets are on sale at the
A.S.S.U. office, at 50 cents for stu
dents and 75 cents for the general
public. They will be sold at the box
office tonight.
