# Encina's a Great Place— Seen from the Shower Out
## 
### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
The Encina shower system is a great leveler. a great democratic insti
tution. Everyone appears in his own natural finery—invidious clothes
comparisons are impossible.
Maybe it is this foundation of democracy that forges Encina shower
takers into a great gay brotherhood. Or maybe it is the fact that the hot
1 + water starts to peter out at 11 o'clock

I that creates the happy atmosphere,;
everyone going on the theory that |
| he had better enjoy the steamy con
viviality while he may.
But whatever the cause, there can
I be no doubt that Encina's troubles j
| are washed down the shower drains j
| and waited out the vents on the
! wings of water vapor and sentiment- '
I al songs.
TIIE MELTING POT
The whole business is an inter- i
; esting study in hydrotherapy. Glow- j
ering football players, world-weary
! scholars, and jaded play-boys come |
| gloomily shuffling down the hall — j
the braver ones at 7 o'clock, the j
average ones at 8:30, pooped boys at 1
11, smooth boys before dinner dates, j
and hot-water sleepers at 10:30. But
whatever the time and no matter j
how glum the pre-shower counte
nance, song sounds out as the water
rumbles through the pipes.
As a general rule there are three
types of shower music; old camp
fire ballads, current and dated sweet!
songs, and the more lyric operatic [
refrains. Campfire ballads are fa- j
vorites just before the grim pros- j
pect of an Encina bed. There is ■
something about the imminence of |
| sleep that produces the long-drawn j
! notes of "Home on the Range," j
; "Glorious, Glorious," "There's a j
! Long, Long Trail A-winding," and
i "Around Her Leg She Wore a Pur
j pie Garter."
! SHOWER SINGERS
Popular band enthusiasts as well
las men who silently envy their
I crooner friends love to sing a few f
; words of the sweet songs and dum- j
i dum-dum-dum-de through the:
I words that only the real record- '
authorities remember. Someone in
variably earns a half-envious, half
| disgusted glance from one of the av
erage singers by booming through
j with every word of "All the Things
j You Are" in a Crosby-like musical
j drool high above the tones of his
I comrades-in-key.
The operatic fragments are usu
-1 ally neglected. But. every now and
then someone who wishes he liked
j the whole opera as much as the j
Toreadore song from Carmen rends
I the title with lots of notes and a j
i lew Ilalian words.
i
But there is one constant factor
< in the Encina shower system: No :
| matter what they sing or at what;
J time, all shower - takers eventually
i get bald. The girls say it is the
j Stanford male's natural unattractive-
I ness. But actually it's the chlorine.
