# Cagers Half Final Series; Earn Second P.C.C. Spot
## Wild Basketball Defeats Bears Friday at Cal 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Stanford's "oft and on" cagers
closed their 1940 season in typical
fashion, beating California 35-33 last
Friday, but dropping Saturday's
game 31-27.
During the week-end, the Cards
mixed fast and brilliant play with
sloppy and listless ball in both
games. Still, by virtue of the win
Friday night, Everett Dean's pro
teges sewed up second place in the
Coast Conference behind U.S.C. with
a league record of six games won
and six lost.
Friday the Indians flashed a
smooth and tricky offense and re
peatedly pierced Cal's defense for
set-ups. What they had in scoring
punch they certainly lacked in de
fense for they allowed the Bears to
make a close game out of what
should have been a walk-away.
BEARS MISS CHANCES
Proof of (he Cards' poor work in
trying to slop the Bears on the
march was the fact that they al
lowed the Bears about twice as
many shots at basket, as they, got
themselves.
That's the main reason why Cal
was able to come with a rush in the
last live minutes to cut the Indian's
G-point lead down to only 2 points.
And truly, Davidson and Company
were lucky to have won, for a half
dozen Bear shots rimmed in and out
in those final hysterical minutes.
WILLIAMS IN SHAPE
Despite all that pre-game talk
about an injured knee, Don Wil
liams played and performed well on
both Friday and Saturday. How
ever, it was Ken Davidson and
Fordy Anderson who led the Cards
attack on Friday with 9 points
apicce. Bob Penn, first of Everett
Dean's two dependable reserves, hit
the bucket for 8 points, but Leon
Lafalile, the other replacement, dis
located his left forefinger warming
up on Friday and wasn't able to play
that night.
Saturday it seemed as though I
bofh teams were entirely tired of |
basketball and were playing merely j
for convention's sake. That is, all I
except big Bill Ogilvie, who showed j
again and for the first time this year |
the form that made him all-Coast!
last year. Ogilvie, still the most un- |
orthodoxly built basketball player in '
the conference, was effective, how- I
ever, scoring 14 of his team's 31 I
points.
DAVIDSON STANDS OCT
The Indians were dead on their j
feet and had a tough time even hold
ing onto the ball. They sparkled
briefly after the second half opened
when they slashed Cal's half-time
lead of 7 points to a mere 1 point,
with three quick field goals.
From there ou in they crumpled,
and the Bears pulled away to win
with ease in an exceedingly dull
game. Again Davidson, the boy the
coaches left off their all-Coast team,
though he was plainly off his game,
led the Cards' scoring with 8 points.
Anderson gathered 7 points in the
defeat and Coach Dean substituted
very freely throughout the game.

Stanford's "oft and on" cagers
closed their 1940 season in typical
fashion, beating California 35-33 last
Friday, but dropping Saturday's
game 31-27.
During the week-end, the Cards
mixed fast and brilliant play with
sloppy and listless ball in both
games. Still, by virtue of the win
Friday night, Everett Dean's pro
teges sewed up second place in the
Coast Conference behind U.S.C. with
a league record of six games won
and six lost.
Friday the Indians flashed a
smooth and tricky offense and re
peatedly pierced Cal's defense for
set-ups. What they had in scoring
punch they certainly lacked in de
fense for they allowed the Bears to
make a close game out of what
should have been a walk-away.
BEARS MISS CHANCES
Proof of (he Cards' poor work in
trying to slop the Bears on the
march was the fact that they al
lowed the Bears about twice as
many shots at basket, as they, got
themselves.
That's the main reason why Cal
was able to come with a rush in the
last live minutes to cut the Indian's
G-point lead down to only 2 points.
And truly, Davidson and Company
were lucky to have won, for a half
dozen Bear shots rimmed in and out
in those final hysterical minutes.
WILLIAMS IN SHAPE
Despite all that pre-game talk
about an injured knee, Don Wil
liams played and performed well on
both Friday and Saturday. How
ever, it was Ken Davidson and
Fordy Anderson who led the Cards
attack on Friday with 9 points
apicce. Bob Penn, first of Everett
Dean's two dependable reserves, hit
the bucket for 8 points, but Leon
Lafalile, the other replacement, dis
located his left forefinger warming
up on Friday and wasn't able to play
that night.
Saturday it seemed as though I
bofh teams were entirely tired of |
basketball and were playing merely j
for convention's sake. That is, all I
except big Bill Ogilvie, who showed j
again and for the first time this year |
the form that made him all-Coast!
last year. Ogilvie, still the most un- |
orthodoxly built basketball player in '
the conference, was effective, how- I
ever, scoring 14 of his team's 31 I
points.
DAVIDSON STANDS OCT
The Indians were dead on their j
feet and had a tough time even hold
ing onto the ball. They sparkled
briefly after the second half opened
when they slashed Cal's half-time
lead of 7 points to a mere 1 point,
with three quick field goals.
From there ou in they crumpled,
and the Bears pulled away to win
with ease in an exceedingly dull
game. Again Davidson, the boy the
coaches left off their all-Coast team,
though he was plainly off his game,
led the Cards' scoring with 8 points.
Anderson gathered 7 points in the
defeat and Coach Dean substituted
very freely throughout the game.
