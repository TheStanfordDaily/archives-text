# Indian Ruggers Beat Winged O In Slow Game
## Gridder's Defensive Play Sparks Indians To 8-3 Win Saturday 
### 
Stanford defeated the Olympic
Club rugby team Saturday, 8-3, but
it took the phenomenal kicking of
Fullback Frankie Albert to save the
game.
Time and again the spectacular
southpaw prevented O. C. scores with
tremendous boots out-of-bounds,
just when it seemed a lackadaisical
Cardinal team was going to fold
completely.
The Indians took the offensive long
enough in the first half to enable
little Jake Thompson to seize a ball
that had been batted high out of a
line-out, and struggle 15 yards for
the first try. Austin converted, and
the Cards led at half-time, 5-0.
Following this score, Stanford
went back on the defensive and re
lied on Albert's kicks until Hugh
Gallarneau suddenly broke loose
with a 50-yard sideline sprint to pay
dirt midway in the second hall'.
The Winged "O" made their three j
points following a five-yard scrum j
when Curly Partridge, former In- J
dian rugger, fell on the ball over the '
line.
After the game Coach Harry Ma- |
loney said:
"The forwards, except for Pugh, 1
Austin, and Thompson, were dead on j
their feet, and the backs fumbled ;
chances time and again. We cer- j
tainly don't stand a chance of beat
ing Cal next week unless the boys |
snap out of it and play the kind of
ball of which they are capable. Al
bert's kicking was the only thing i
that saved us from a defeat today." !
