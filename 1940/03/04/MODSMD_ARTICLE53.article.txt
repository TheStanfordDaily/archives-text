# Organized Bag Throwing

### 
IF Leap Year were going to last forever, the
Men's Vocational Committee would probably
be far less disturbed than it is over being unable
to secure a subsidy from A.S.S.U. funds.
But with a mere eight months remaining, the
men think that it is absolutely ridiculous for
the women, whom theoretically they will sup
port in the future, to get $150 a year for voca
tional guidance when they get none.
But last year it was something else concern
ing the sex they claim they can't understand,
that the men though was absolutely ridiculous.
It was organization. A group of w.omen had
said, "We're organized," and the kindest of
the many comments which followed were those
of the Daily columnists who expressed the "Oh
well, it will keep them out of mischief" attitude.
The cause and effect here is that it is through
the Women's Conference budget that the wom
en's vocational committee is financed.
Of course people aren't saying "Can't you
just see a Men's Conference?" for nothing. It
would probably just accentuate the water-bag
situation.
But some application of the principle which
launched a thousand labor unions would have
no good reason for failing to help the men get
a program to help them get the right job—and
incidentally a better way to keep the women
out of mischief.
Organization! Humph!
But people have stooped lower for $150.—
