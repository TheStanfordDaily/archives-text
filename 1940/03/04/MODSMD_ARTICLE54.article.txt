T. HUGH JACKSON, Dean of the Business
J School and Acting Comptroller, and A1 Trow
bridge, Assistant Comptroller, deserve a world
of credit for their part in securing an appropria
tion that will have an underpass built at the
El Camino intersection before Christmas of this
year.
These two men have been acting in their
nominal positions as agents of the University,
but it is doubtful if the California Highway Com
mission could have been persuaded to act so
quickly by men less capable. The University
itself deserves no small degree of campus ap
preciation, since it contributed four acres of its
most valuable property for the project. Inter
ested Stanford men on the Palo Alto Council
and Board of Public Works toiled unnoticed
and strenuously for several years for a clover
leaf intersection that they knew would solve a
serious problem and protect scores of both stu
dent and civilian lives.
Their months of agitation and planning have
been rewarded now in full, but there is one
thing that we shouldn't forgetâ€”a vote of thanks.
Whenever the Administration jumps down
our throats or imposes restrictions that we don't
like, we are the first to moan and pout. The
Daily is no small exception to this cardinal prin
ciple of student life. This time, however, the
Administration was dead right all the way. It
offered its time and money and the services of
its valuable men for a project that several times
seemed doomed to failure.
Their work is now capped with deserved
success. A slight vote of applause from the
student body is all that remains to be con
tributed.
