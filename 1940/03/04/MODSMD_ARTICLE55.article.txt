REPERCUSSIONS

r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
How about enlisting your support for a cam
paign to got Stanford another memorial theater? The
procedure is simple . . . we merely listen to Dr.
Trueblood and DufT Cooper telling us that, Hitler is a
devil, therefore being Christians with a mania for
crusades we beain a campaign of the massacre of
Germany's male population and starvation of its fe
male and child population. This will make the world
safe for freedom and decency, two nice words that
have replaced the no longer glamorous word "democ
racy."
In the fiuhting a number of Stanfordites will be
killed and quite naturally another auditorium will be
built, dedicated to them. Who knows, perhaps you
will be able to see "George and Margaret" at 7 o'clock
and then slip over t<» the other theater for the 9
o'clock production. (Incidentally, this will boost drama
i.etivities on the Farm.)
Yes, the number of gold star mothers is on the
decrease, and there are vacant rooms in the veterans'
hospitals . . leaving room for plenty of Stanford
la<!s VVY can use those social misfits from Oklahoma

for bayonet drill dummies, ton.
Who was the Stanford sociologist who said, "What
isn't blamed on sex is blamed on Hitler."

LOOKS LIKE AN EPIDEMIC

'JpilE EDITOR. SIR: •
Although my feeble protest will drift away in the
winds of freedom, I now wish to voice my complaint
against the "Back to the Rough" week which Is forth
coming. I don't object to the idea itself, but it is the
part which features attire of jeans and cords that
seems so abominable to me.
Alter I spend at least ten to fifteen minutes primp
ing my hair and earnestly trying to make myself at
tractve for the benefit of those around me, I am forced
to sit next to a boy who wears filthy jeans (the same
pair) every morning to my 8 o'clock. His appearance
is, of course, ragged and unpleasant, but more than
that, he represents a filthy and unhealthy picture. To
verify the "unhealthy" assertion, I refer to a text by
Sylvester H. Claussen, professor of bacteriology at
Ruggles Clinical College in Pocatello, Idaho. He says,
"Unknown to many, even those in the medical pro
fession, is a small virus actually living off of the mate
rial in the common laborer's jeans' This virus slowly
goes into the skin by a process of osmosis and even
tually causes Nagrussey's Disease (Anthropidoidal-
Parametrethedus)."
I really hope this letter will influence some of you
"roughs" to take a bath, even if you do persist in
wearing dirty jeans and cords.
Sincerely yours,
Rosalie Ann Shafter
