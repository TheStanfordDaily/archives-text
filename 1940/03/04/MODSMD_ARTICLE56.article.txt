### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
fAPAN has long been a foe of the ponderous Rus
sian Bear that lumbers to the cast of the Chinese
War. Since the Russo-Japanese War the Rising Sun
of the East has harbored a patriotic hate for its vast
neighbor. And when the Russian Revolution inaugu
rated communism, the Oriental war lords were really
angry. "We are the arch-foes of Bolshevism," they
told us. "Japanese honor will defend the East from
Communism."
These nationalistic hates and honors sounded rather
impressive, if bellicose. There was the Imperial Japa
nese Government, reigned over by a descendant of
the Son of God, announcing to the world its staunch
opposition to Communism.
That was before Japan felt the pinch of material
need. The refusal of the United States to continue its
Japanese trade agreements has touched Japanese honor
where it is sure to be felt—right in the pocketbook.
Japanese newspapers no longer are fighting a verbal
battle with the red menace. They now are suggesting
that the attitude of the United States is likely to
drive Japan into the "Soviet Camp." This time they are
probably telling the truth.

J7OR economic reasons Japan would forget its vio
lent hate of Russia and Communism. And once "in
the Soviet Camp" those artful oriental diplomats,
fully as skillful as western wigglers, will find all sorts
of honorable reasons for a purely materialistic move.
"Japan and Russia are joining to free the East of the
yoke of western democracies"—something lyric and
high-sounding like that.
At the time of the Manchukuoan invasion one Japa
nese diplomat implied that Japan was really "declar
ing peace on China." Something diplomatically asinine
like that will no doubt herald the Russo-Japanese
alliance.
Lincoln Steffens was once asked what his motto
was. The questioner no doubt expected a fine new
phrase for the Boy Scouts of America. But the answer
was simple and suggestively sarcastic. "My motto is
one word long," Steffens said, "Wiggle." The nations
of the world work on a similar premise, just three
words longer—honor, hate, wiggle, and war.
In some ways this policy is a splendid institution.
How drab world history would be if warring nations
just went around explaining their moves in terms of
cold economics. Economics, as everyone knows, is
much too practical, and its language is decidedly
drab.
It is much more romantic to dress materialistic mo
tives up in nice honorable phrases, avoiding dilemmas
with artistic wiggling. Isn't it much nicer to say that
honor, rather than commercialism, makes diplomacy
go 'round?

How drab world history would be if warring nations
just went around explaining their moves in terms of
cold economics. Economics, as everyone knows, is
much too practical, and its language is decidedly
drab.
It is much more romantic to dress materialistic mo
tives up in nice honorable phrases, avoiding dilemmas
with artistic wiggling. Isn't it much nicer to say that
honor, rather than commercialism, makes diplomacy
go 'round?
fAPAN has long been a foe of the ponderous Rus
sian Bear that lumbers to the cast of the Chinese
War. Since the Russo-Japanese War the Rising Sun
of the East has harbored a patriotic hate for its vast
neighbor. And when the Russian Revolution inaugu
rated communism, the Oriental war lords were really
angry. "We are the arch-foes of Bolshevism," they
told us. "Japanese honor will defend the East from
Communism."
These nationalistic hates and honors sounded rather
impressive, if bellicose. There was the Imperial Japa
nese Government, reigned over by a descendant of
the Son of God, announcing to the world its staunch
opposition to Communism.
That was before Japan felt the pinch of material
need. The refusal of the United States to continue its
Japanese trade agreements has touched Japanese honor
where it is sure to be felt—right in the pocketbook.
Japanese newspapers no longer are fighting a verbal
battle with the red menace. They now are suggesting
that the attitude of the United States is likely to
drive Japan into the "Soviet Camp." This time they are
probably telling the truth.

of honorable reasons for a purely materialistic move.
"Japan and Russia are joining to free the East of the
yoke of western democracies"—something lyric and
high-sounding like that.
At the time of the Manchukuoan invasion one Japa

like that will no doubt herald the Russo-Japanese
alliance.
Lincoln Steffens was once asked what his motto
was. The questioner no doubt expected a fine new
phrase for the Boy Scouts of America. But the answer
was simple and suggestively sarcastic. "My motto is
one word long," Steffens said, "Wiggle." The nations
of the world work on a similar premise, just three
words longer—honor, hate, wiggle, and war.
