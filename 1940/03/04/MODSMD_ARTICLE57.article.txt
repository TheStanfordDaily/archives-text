APOLOGY TO SPRING
I would love to climb a mountain and reach the
highest peak, but it doesn't thrill me half as much
as dancing cheek to cheek.

YES, SPRING
Here today, Sunday, the boys and girls here in the
Shack are singing, and more than that, Ihey are sing
ing in their Spring clothes.
On the Quad they were looking like Spring, Spring
with a capital letter, being a part of Spring. There
are canocs on the Lake, loafing through the water, and
people loafing around the boathouse watching the
canoes and Spring.
And every time you see an overcoat on the Quad,
you know that there is a female in shorts under it.
Yes, a female sublimating her feeling of Spring to
the moral feeling of the Administration.

TO THE EXTREME
Campus Opinion's A Hopeful Senior took his date
canoeing the night of the Roble spring formal, as
some of you will remember, the year he was a fresh
man.
Now A Hopeful was quite a singer on a date.
Through his nose he would sing, "I hadn't anyone but
you," but that was a year later. I can't remember
what he might have been singing that year, but it
was something as far from the song about four of us
at a table for two as he could find.
And on this night he was wearing his tux. and the
girl was in her pretty clothes when they went out in
the canoe.
Hopeful sang to her. I suppose she paddled while he
sang; with his eyes closed.
And then he reached—for a high note, perhaps—and
upset the canoe.

ENCORE
A year later at the Junior Water Carnival the old
Boathouse collapsed and hit him on the head.
He was out of his mind for several hours. Several
of us were there at the time, and the doctor told us
he wa.s a little out of his head.
"How can you tell?" we said.
"Listen to him," the doctor said.
We shrugged politely.

NO. LADY
last spring a Farm girl went over to the
men s gym one afternoon, walked in, got clear in as
far as the room where they give out the towels.
She stepped in the room and right before her was
a verv. very nude man.
"Oh!" she said, throwing her hands over her face.
"I thoiieht this was the I! AC."
