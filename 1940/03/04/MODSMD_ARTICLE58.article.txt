"NORTHWEST PASSAGE," now
playing at the Fox Stanford.
"Don't attack until you hear me
give the cry of a loon."
That command, plus 150 men
dressed up like Robin Hood, beau
tiful north woods scenery, excellent
color photography, and a bloody,
bloody fracas at an Indian camp, is
M.G.M.'s impression of "Northwest
Passage."
The movies, however, were smart
this time. When "Anthony Adverse"
was filmed, they tried to condense
over 1,000 pages into three hours of
celluloid. They tried the same thing
in "Gone with the Wind."
NO CONDENSATION
But in filming Kenneth Roberts'
heralded novel of strong men and
America, the moguls simply drama
tized one of the three books that
make up the novel. "Northwest
Passage" is actually the story of
Rogers' Rangers.
It is a drama of intrepid adven
turers intent upon wiping out the
home camp of a flock of marauding
Indians and a few unpopular French
men. The time, 1759—just before
the French and Indian wars.
HARDSHIPS GALORE
Rogers' Rangers is a near-guer
rilla troop of green-clad hearties who
set out 200 strong and come back
with a handful. The entire picture
is devoted to unbelievable hard
ships, Indian fights, men slogging
through a wilderness, and sequences
full of Spencer Tracy's strong jaw
line.
Robert Young is one of the heroic
band. He is expelled from Harvard,
spurned by his girl's father because
he wants to be an artist, and induced
into the Rangers because he can
make such lovely maps.
But there is real adventure here.
The photoplay is fast, bloody, fairly
convincing. A minimum of love in
terest and a maximum of hardy
heroics make it an engrossing film.
The technicolor photography is ex
cellent.—Burtt

America, the moguls simply drama
tized one of the three books that
make up the novel. "Northwest
Passage" is actually the story of
Rogers' Rangers.
It is a drama of intrepid adven
turers intent upon wiping out the
home camp of a flock of marauding
Indians and a few unpopular French
men. The time, 1759—just before
the French and Indian wars.
HARDSHIPS GALORE
Rogers' Rangers is a near-guer
rilla troop of green-clad hearties who
set out 200 strong and come back
with a handful. The entire picture
is devoted to unbelievable hard
ships, Indian fights, men slogging
through a wilderness, and sequences
full of Spencer Tracy's strong jaw
line.
Robert Young is one of the heroic
band. He is expelled from Harvard,
spurned by his girl's father because
he wants to be an artist, and induced
into the Rangers because he can
make such lovely maps.
But there is real adventure here.
The photoplay is fast, bloody, fairly
convincing. A minimum of love in
terest and a maximum of hardy
heroics make it an engrossing film.
The technicolor photography is ex
cellent.—Burtt
