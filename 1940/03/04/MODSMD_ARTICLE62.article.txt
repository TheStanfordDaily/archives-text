# TWO MEN DIE IN BLAZE
## 
### 
AUBURN, March 3 (UP).â€”Trap
ped in their blazing cabin, two men
were burned to death early today.
They were identified as Edward
Strand, W.P.A. worker, and A. C.
Knoll, a gardener.
More than 60 trillion ultra-viruses,
nature's smallest living things, and
deadly enemies of mankind, can be
crowded into a square inch.
