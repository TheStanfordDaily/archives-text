ARCADIA, March 3 (UP).-Sea
biscuit has passed Sun Beau by—
but he isn't through with racing yet.
That was what owner Charles S.
i Howard indicated tonight while
local turf historians still were busily
recording the various and sundry
broken records the doughty veteran
left behind while rolling to victory
in the sixth running of the $100,000
| Santa Anita handicap.
Howard said he and Trainer Tom
. Smith would confer at length before
t a iinal verdict is reached but he in
timated broadly that the horse may
i continue to run at least through
| the summer in an attempt to stretch
| his brand new earnings mark of
j $437,730 even higher. There is little
! chance that the Biscuit again will
tour the nation's tracks, however, as
if he remains in training he will be
pointed for the third running of the
i $50,000 Hollywood gold cup, a prize
I he won in 1938.
If Howard decides not to send him
back to the wars, Seabiscuit will be
retired to the Howard ranch near
! San Francisco and there placed at
I stud.
Joseph Jefferson, who made the
| role of Rip Van Winkle famous on
j the stage, was also a landscape
painter.
