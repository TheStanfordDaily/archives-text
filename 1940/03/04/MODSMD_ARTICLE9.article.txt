## 
### 
Roving reporter and photographer
Julian Bryan, many of whose films
have been featured by "March of
Time," will tell his experiences in
"I Saw Warsaw" tomorrow for the
Tuesday Evening Series at 7:30
o'clock in Memorial Hall.
When he heard last August that
Hitler's troops had marched into
Poland he started for Warsaw. On
the 6th he was in Lublin, which
the Polish government, had then
j made its capital. Unaware of this,
! he put in a call to the embassy at
j Warsaw and because of official red
j tape was not told that the person he
j was attempting to contact was then
in the very town from which he
| was trailing.
For the first few days he wan
dered about Warsaw without any
J official military permits, constantly
I risking arrest, in the spy-conscious
| city. Mr. Bryan remained in War
i saw until the 21st, taking motion
i pictures and still photographs.
During the last eight years Mr.
' Bryan has been a roving reporter

I taking documentary films in the
Soviet Union, and the almost inac
cessible regions in the Caucasus,
Siberia, Manchukuo, Japan, China,
Turkey, Poland, Finland, and Ger
many.
