# History ... 1940

### WILSON CANNON 
years ago yesterday Presi
dent Franklin Delano Roosevelt
took the helm of the American ship
of state.
For millions of men and women
throughout these United States the
occasion was one for joy and cele
bration. Roosevelt was to the voters
the Messiah who would lead them
out of the economic wilderness.
Solemn and auspicious was the
state cercmony which saw the
new President sworn into office.
Thousands thronged the stops of
the Capitol building to hear Mr.
Roosevelt take the oath of 'office
in a voice that brimmed with
emotion.
Seven years from last January 19,
Adolf Hitler became the rudder of
the German state battleship.
Millions of men and women
through the Reich wondered what
would become of the German Re
public. Hitler to them was a polit
ical question mark ... a man whom
they knew only as a radical.
The ceremony in which the Fueh
rer bcame Germany's leader was not
witnessed by howling thousands. It
was a political coup de grace which
unrolled with only four persons as
witnesses.
Hitler. Ilugenbcrg, and von
Papen entered President von Hin
denhurg's sleeping quarters at 11
o'clock the evening of January 29,
1!)3.'5. The Old Man was roused
from sleep to hear that civil war
in Germany was imminent. He
drowsily heard the plans which
would create a Nazi-Nationalist
government.
The world-weary 'president fell
for the plan. He appointed Hitler
chancellor, von Papen vice-chancel
lor . . . then rolled over and went
back to sleep.
An Austrian-born ex-corporal
was head of the Reich.
* *
the Rooseveltian regime ush
ered out the first seven years of
the New Deal and heralded the
eighth last night, no indication of
Roosevelt's third-term plans had yet
been received by a curious American
voting public.
The President's stand in 1940 re
mains the enigma of the current
American political scene.
But in Germany the paunchy little
ex-corporal needs no assurance of a
voting majority behind him. The
mailed fist of the Reich waves in the
face of every citizen.
The last reasonably fair (from an
Anglo-Saxon standpoint), election,
on March 5, 1933, gave Hitler a 37
per cent, majority vote of confidence
... in spite of the fact that it oc
curred under the shadow of the
great. Reichstag fire. If an election
were held in Germany today Der
Fuehrer would probably better that
margin considerably.

IN AMERICA, the Republican
party, under the whip of national
chairman John Hamilton, is well un
der way in the fourth-year pageant
of mumblings and grumblings that
is expected of the political under
dog.
In the German 1933 election there
were some 12 million opposing votes.
But in succeeding plebiscites the
"nein" votes have been sadly miss
ing. Citizens of the Reich vote "ja"
because they have no delusions as
to their voting status.
In the senate yesterday, John
Nance Garner, vice-president and
outstanding Democratic candidate
for the White House, silently laid
before the chamber a resolution
of the New York legislature which
asked that legislation he enacted
lo "prevent any President from
seeking a third term."
No such document will appear be
fore the Reichstag. Hitler is the
German Messiah, and he will remain
there a.s long as the Nazi field army
remains the best in the world.
"Theirs but to do or die . . . ours
but to reason why."
