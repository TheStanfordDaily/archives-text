# Grad Solves National Park Radio Puzzle
## Invention Facilitates 'Two-way Broadcasts 
### JOHN HORRALL 
Solving a problem which has long
puzzled the National Park Service
is the distinction Millet G. Morgan,
Stanford graduate electrical engi
neering student, holds today.
Morgan, in collaboration with W.
C. Hilgedick, radio engineer for the
Park Service, perfected a mobile
radio antenna, making possible long
distance, two - way communication
between motorized units equipped
with small transmitters. Thurlow
Gordon,' Jr., graduate student in
electrical engineering, aLso assisted
in the work.
U.S. DONATES $2,500
Morgan and Hilgedick worked at
the Ryan Laboratory for three
months experimenting with the out
fit. The two were given $2,500 by
the United States government for
expenses and a car to try out the
antenna.
Hilgedick made a demonstration
tour of the national parks while
Morgan stayed here aid finished his
thesis on the subject.
"The Los Angeles Bureau of Light
and Power had a boat on Lake Mead
at Boulder Dam," quoted the young
engineer, "which could carry on
boat-to-shore communication cov
ering only , r >o per cent of the lake's
area.
"The new antenna, with an overall
length of seven feet less than that
| used by the Los Angeles bureau,
covered the lake 100 per cent. Rocky
Mountain and Death Valley parks
could be reached besides."
SUCCESSFUL TESTS
The apparatus, which works on an
input power of 15 watts, was so
successful in its first trial that 10
are now in the Blue Ridge Parkway
i in Virginia, and one i.s installed per
jinanently at Boulder Dam.
Yellowstone National Park wants
10, and Pan-American Airlines, the
U.S. Army Signal Corps, the high
way departments of California, Ore
gon, and Washington, and the Cali
fornia State Forestry Division are
making investigations for possible
use.
