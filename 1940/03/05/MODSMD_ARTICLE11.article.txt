# Grad Solves National Park Radio Puzzle
## Invention Facilitates 'Two-way Broadcasts 
### JOHN HORRALL 
Solving a problem which has long
puzzled the National Park Service
is the distinction Millet G. Morgan,
Stanford graduate electrical engi
neering student, holds today.
Morgan, in collaboration with W.
C. Hilgedick, radio engineer for the
Park Service, perfected a mobile
radio antenna, making possible long
distance, two - way communication
between motorized units equipped
with small transmitters. Thurlow
Gordon,' Jr., graduate student in
electrical engineering, aLso assisted
in the work.
U.S. DONATES $2,500
Morgan and Hilgedick worked at
the Ryan Laboratory for three
months experimenting with the out
fit. The two were given $2,500 by
the United States government for
expenses and a car to try out the
antenna.
Hilgedick made a demonstration
tour of the national parks while
Morgan stayed here aid finished his
thesis on the subject.
"The Los Angeles Bureau of Light
and Power had a boat on Lake Mead
at Boulder Dam," quoted the young
engineer, "which could carry on
boat-to-shore communication cov
ering only , r >o per cent of the lake's
area.
"The new antenna, with an overall
length of seven feet less than that
| used by the Los Angeles bureau,
covered the lake 100 per cent. Rocky
Mountain and Death Valley parks
could be reached besides."
SUCCESSFUL TESTS
The apparatus, which works on an
input power of 15 watts, was so
successful in its first trial that 10

Mr. Bryan took 500 still photo- j

Knowing that he could never sim

German lines, he worked out plans
which he refuses to reveal for his
movies. He managed to smu_*<»le the
stills through, but the bulky motion
picture films could not follow any
simple route, fie returned to the
United States and three months later
received them.
"I have learned one thing from
my travels: that whatever the dic
tators and militarists of the world
may desire, the vast majority of all
populations, the common people like
ourselves, want peace and are bit

has written.
For this reason he has spent the
last eight years photographing the ,

U.S. DONATES $2,500
Morgan and Hilgedick worked at
the Ryan Laboratory for three
months experimenting with the out
fit. The two were given $2,500 by
the United States government for
expenses and a car to try out the
antenna.
Hilgedick made a demonstration
tour of the national parks while
Morgan stayed here aid finished his
thesis on the subject.
