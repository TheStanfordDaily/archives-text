# Card Ski Team Places Second In Coast Meet
## McDuffie, Ditz Upset Dope; Nevada Drops To Third, Cal First 
### 
A surprise 95-foot jump by Bud
McDuffie hoisted Stanford into sec
ond place behind the University of
California at the fifth Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate ski meet held last
week-end at Yosemite.
University of Nevada's Bob
Roecken won the jumping event with
140.2 points—not a high enough
score, however, to put Nevada into
the second place she had expected.
McDuffie's 125.9 points and fourth
place were enough to upset that, ex
pectation, leaving Nevada in third
place.
Tills Badger Pass meet, with 12
coast colleges and universities par
ticipating, was McDuffie's second try
at competitive jumping.
Total points for the meet gave
California 393; Stanford, 374.73; Ne
vada, 370.2(5.
DITZ UPSETS DOPE
Second upset of the three-day
week-end was Jack Ditz' surprise
third, place in downhill Saturday
afternoon. His speedy no-check, no
fall run helped Stanford take second
place behind Nevada in the event.
Captain Bill Janss of the Card
team took sixth place in downhill
and Dave Nottage also placed. Le
roy Rust of Fresno State won the
event.
Farm skiers started their heavy
scoring Friday afternoon, when
Janss took first place in cross coun
try with a time of 38:17.3. California
won the cross country with Stanford
second. Two other Stanford con
tenders, Eilert Stoeren and Nottage,
placed 6th and 14th, respectively.
JANSS FASTEST
In slalom competition Saturday
morning, Janss placed third, making
the fastest individual run of the day,
52 seconds, over the fast, hard
packed course. McDuffie was 12th.
The event was won by Captain
George Gester of California, whose
run gave Cal the event, leaving the
Cards in second place.
The meet continued with downhill
that afternoon and jumping Sunday
morning.
As a result of last week-end's
competition, five Stanford skiers al
ready have earned their letters, ac
cording to Captain Janss—McDuffie,
Ditz, Stoeren, Janss, and Phil Clay
burgh.
POISON OAK STRIKES
Clayburgh entered the slalom, al
though his face was covered with
poison oak ointment and his vision
i was impaired. Paul Nau turned an
j ankle while practicing for the down
i hill and was unable to compete.
Back at Stanford late Sunday
I night after the three-day compcti-
I lion, McDuffie and Janss planned to
return to Yosemite next week-end
for the state downhill and slalom
tournament, in which will par
ticipate as individuals instead of as
I part of a team.
Additional recognition for these
! two as well as Ditz came Sunday in
i the form of the gold intercollegiate
I medal awarded to all three.
