# Ruggers Prepare For Bear Match
## 
### 
Coaches of the Stanford rugby
team started intensive practice last
nifjht in preparation for the Big
Game next Saturday against Cal.
Heavy scrimmage was in order, as
Coaches Harry Maloney, Jim Wylie,
and Willard Clausen set about iron
ing out the numerous kinks that
showed themselves in last Satur
day's close game against the Olym
pic Club, which Stanford won, 8-3.
Opposition of the toughest sort is
expected from the Bears, who make
up in ruggedness what they lack in
finesse. The Card coaches have gone
on record as expecting a Cardinal
shellacking unless the team plays
far above last Saturday's standard
and much closer to its potentialities.
