THERE'S A QUESTION we'd like
to ask Clark Shaughnessy when he
arrives Thursday morning to meet
the local students at an assembly.
It's about the $1000 worth of grid
equipment which Shaughnessy won
while at the University of Chicago
last year for the best "hard-luck"
story of the year.
He won the Spokane Sports
Round Table award in a breeze,
while football was still being
played at Chicago. Now it has
been abandoned in favor.of in
tramural football. So just to be
facetious, did the B.A.C. get the
equipment lined up for Stanford
delivery when they signed the
new coach?

STANFORD AND CAL lock horns !
in two more sports this week-end. j
The squared-ring performers meet j
in the Pavilion Thursday night in a
rematch, which will be more inter- i
esting because of the seventh meet
ing between the rival captains, Jack '
Rice and Jules Droubay, who fight j
in the 145-pound class.
Perhaps because the two box
ers were on edge in their last
meeting that we can account for
the draw. The score stands three
to two for Rice, one of the most
colorful Card mittmen.

TWO CROWNS WILL be decided
in one game Saturday, when the
Indian rugby club meets Cal at Ber
keley. If scores are to be reckoned
as good criterions then the locals
should cop the Intercollegiate con
ference and the Northern California
Rugby titles.
But scores in rugby as in other
sports don't mean a thing. So look
for a hard-fought and close match.
* * *
DOT'S SO . . . This isn't exactly
news because he's been appointed
for more than two months now, but
did you know that Bob Dofflemyer
will be head football manager next
fall? . . . Art McDearmid, who also
plays on his house's intramural five,
goes out soon as head basketball
manager . . . This is merely hear
say, but I've heard that he's been a
real manager, and handled that east
ern trip swell . . . He'll be succeeded
by one of three: Joe Ferry, Charles
Haber, Chuck Ott, present junior
managers . . ,
Clark Shaughnessy will be on
the campus no longer than an hour !
before he'll be shunted off to the j
City to speak at the Press Club, j
Thursday noon, to the sports writ
ers . . . Then he'll make a circuit '
of California on a series of speak
ing engagements before alumni
groups and newspapermen . . .
Maybe you've wondered why Sam J
Barry was reprimanded by Referee '
Lloyd Leith in the second U.S.C. I
game here a week ago . . . Barry
objected to the time Stanford men !
took in getting the ball in play on i
out-of-bound plays . So Barry j

THERE'S A QUESTION we'd like
to ask Clark Shaughnessy when he
arrives Thursday morning to meet
the local students at an assembly.
It's about the $1000 worth of grid
equipment which Shaughnessy won
while at the University of Chicago
last year for the best "hard-luck"
story of the year.
He won the Spokane Sports
Round Table award in a breeze,
while football was still being
played at Chicago. Now it has
been abandoned in favor.of in
tramural football. So just to be
facetious, did the B.A.C. get the
equipment lined up for Stanford
delivery when they signed the
new coach?

STANFORD AND CAL lock horns !
in two more sports this week-end. j
The squared-ring performers meet j
in the Pavilion Thursday night in a
rematch, which will be more inter- i
esting because of the seventh meet
ing between the rival captains, Jack '
Rice and Jules Droubay, who fight j
in the 145-pound class.
Perhaps because the two box
ers were on edge in their last
meeting that we can account for
the draw. The score stands three
to two for Rice, one of the most
colorful Card mittmen.

THERE'S A QUESTION we'd like
to ask Clark Shaughnessy when he
arrives Thursday morning to meet
the local students at an assembly.
It's about the $1000 worth of grid
equipment which Shaughnessy won
while at the University of Chicago
last year for the best "hard-luck"
story of the year.
He won the Spokane Sports
Round Table award in a breeze,
while football was still being
played at Chicago. Now it has
been abandoned in favor.of in
tramural football. So just to be
facetious, did the B.A.C. get the
equipment lined up for Stanford
delivery when they signed the
new coach?

STANFORD AND CAL lock horns !
in two more sports this week-end. j
The squared-ring performers meet j
in the Pavilion Thursday night in a
rematch, which will be more inter- i
esting because of the seventh meet
ing between the rival captains, Jack '
Rice and Jules Droubay, who fight j
in the 145-pound class.
Perhaps because the two box
ers were on edge in their last
meeting that we can account for
the draw. The score stands three
to two for Rice, one of the most
colorful Card mittmen.

TWO CROWNS WILL be decided
in one game Saturday, when the
Indian rugby club meets Cal at Ber
keley. If scores are to be reckoned
as good criterions then the locals
should cop the Intercollegiate con
ference and the Northern California
Rugby titles.
But scores in rugby as in other
sports don't mean a thing. So look
for a hard-fought and close match.

DOT'S SO . . . This isn't exactly
news because he's been appointed
for more than two months now, but
did you know that Bob Dofflemyer
will be head football manager next
fall? . . . Art McDearmid, who also
plays on his house's intramural five,
goes out soon as head basketball
manager . . . This is merely hear
say, but I've heard that he's been a
real manager, and handled that east
ern trip swell . . . He'll be succeeded
by one of three: Joe Ferry, Charles
Haber, Chuck Ott, present junior
managers . . ,
Clark Shaughnessy will be on
the campus no longer than an hour !
before he'll be shunted off to the j
City to speak at the Press Club, j
Thursday noon, to the sports writ
ers . . . Then he'll make a circuit '
of California on a series of speak
ing engagements before alumni
groups and newspapermen . . .
Maybe you've wondered why Sam J
Barry was reprimanded by Referee '
Lloyd Leith in the second U.S.C. I
game here a week ago . . . Barry
objected to the time Stanford men !
took in getting the ball in play on i
out-of-bound plays . So Barry j
yelled at Leith to give a verbal j
count . . . and so Leith slapped a '
technical foul on U.S.C. .
