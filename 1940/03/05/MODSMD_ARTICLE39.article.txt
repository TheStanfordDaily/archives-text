# Strong Texas Squad to Meet Card Splashers
## Longhorns Favored To Whip Weak Farm Mermen Tomorrow 
### 
In their first invasion of the Pa- j
cific Coast, the University ot Texas j
Longhorns will bring an impressive
record in intercollegiate swimming
to Stanford tomorrow and are fa- j
vored to whip the Indians in the
outstanding dual meet of the season. '
The Farm has its weakest team in |
years and the Steers, boasting one j
of the most powerful aggregations in
the country, should win the meet j
handily. Coach Nort Thornton will j
pin his slim hopes on Corcaptains j
Roy Vitousek and Bill Wceden, ]
Howie Adams, and Pete Okumoto. i
After trouncing the Stanford pad- |
dlers here Friday, Fullerton J. C.'s
Yellowjackets whipped California!
the following day 53 to 22 to top off |
their victorious northern junket, j
Fred Gass, the Hornets' backstroke j
star, shattered pool records at both j
Stanford and Cal.

onstrate his supremacy in coast j
ing with a beautiful series of op- j
tional dives Friday afternon. Adams J
will face Billy Brink, southwest j
conference champ, Wednesday, for
his toughest competition yet this
season.
