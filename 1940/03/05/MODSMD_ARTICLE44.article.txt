# Frosh Horsehiders To Face Mariners
## 
### 
Heartened by wins last week
against San Mateo J. C. and San
Jose high school, Stanford's frosh
baseball club will meet Marin J. C.
this afternoon at 2:30 o'clock. Coach
Harry Shipkey indicated that Phil
Wolf will pitch.
Friday's tilt with Lowell High has
been postponed until Saturday,
1:30 o'clock, as the frosh are
angling for a possible game with
Palo Alto High for Friday.
