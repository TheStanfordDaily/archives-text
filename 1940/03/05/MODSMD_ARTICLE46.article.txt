# Endowment Dilemma
## 
### 
REMEMBER the Carnegie Foundation for the
Advancement of Teaching? In case you
don't, it's the famous Eastern body that has
done so much in the past decade for the fur
therance of education in colleges and second
ary schools. Its report on the detrimental and
beneficial aspects of intercollegiate and inter
scholastic athletics will go down in history as
the first exhaustive study of a sporting world
run rampant with proselyting and subsidiza
tion. Ed Atherton was a child playing cops and
robbers when this august body first went to
work on problems and cures in education.
The Carnegie's latest annual report contains
several especially timely divulgences on the
endowment situation. The problem of finance
is becoming acute in the privately endowed
college. No one has to elaborate on that prem
ise for the Stanford Administration officials.
Surprising, however, may be the disclosure
that state institutions are leading the private
ones in income from both philanthropic and en
rollment sources. Too much of the money that
schools such as Stanford do obtain is ear
marked for specific researchâ€”such pursuits at
Stanford as the Guggenheim research labora
tory, marriage surveys, the Ryan laboratory,
and so on.
How, then, will the schools in the same classi
fication as Stanford keep up the general well
being and prestige that they have built up over
a period of years? By handpicking students and
getting and keeping only the best of eguipment
and professors would seem to be the only logi
cal answer.
But students will not go where the professors
are childish or where the eguipment looks like
the remains of the 1906 earthquake. It just isn't
logical.
And the good professors nowadays aren't
working for peanuts. Nor can you buy class
room equipment on the FHA.
Carnegie didn't say this, but the only sane
way of replacing peanuts with dollars is to go
out into the alumni field and solicit unearmarked
nickels and dimes to protect this $43,000,000
investment that is Stanford.
And if some enterprising solicitor comes
around when you are a senior or an alumnus,
think over the Carnegie facts and figures, then
write a two-buck check or more, even if you
have to post-date it, and dedicate it to the great
est four years that you'll ever live.
