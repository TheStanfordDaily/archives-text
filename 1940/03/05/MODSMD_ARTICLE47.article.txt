STANFORD UNIVERSITY, March 5 (CNS*).—
In spite of Stanford's well-organized Health
Service, there is a threatened epidemic of Na
grussey's Disease (Anthropidoidal-Parametrethe
dus) according to Rosalie Ann Shafter, Campus
Opinion contributor.
The situation will be greatly aggravated by a
Back to the Farm Week" which, planned by
the student body, has as part of its festivities the
extensive wearing of jeans. Miss Shafter claims
that these jeans form the medium in which the
virus of the dread disease lives.
Miss Shafter has taken a particular dislike to
one pair of jeans worn by the boy who sits next
to her in her eight o'clock because she is sure
that this is the main breeding place of the virus
and that it spreads to the rest of the campus
from there.
According to campus medical authorities,
however, danger of an epidemic is not immi
nent, and student body leaders say that the
planned "Back to the Farm Week" will continue
with the wearing of jeans still one of its major
planks.
A representative sampling of the student body
shows that it hopes that Miss Shafter will con
tinue to take ten to fifteen minutes each morn
ing to make herself attractive because, as they
aptly put it, "we appreciate her efforts to make
herself attractive."
