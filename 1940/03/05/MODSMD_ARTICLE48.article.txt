HE IJKES IT DREAMY

'JMIE EDITOR, SIR:
I cannot help feeling that a current of mental
retrogression, although in a nuclear state, is weaving
itself in the mind of our Daily editor. Last week an
article appeared which more than subtly suggested a
policy of reinitiation for "swing" music here at Stan
ford.
There is nothing distasteful about such music in
i4s proper environment, that is, in an immoral Negro
barroom in West Harlem, but at Stanford, there is
nothing to accommodate this "jitterbug" society. I at
tended the dance some time ago when Fletcher Hen
derson, of whom I had never heard, and his group of
so-called "musicians" ran rampant in the basketball
pavilion. My opinion, in accordance with at least a
dozen or more of my friends, was that the only
audible sounds were high-screeching brass notes and a
lot of chaotic pounding by various percussion instru
ments. How is anyone but a "jitterbug" expected to
dance in the midst of such nebulous tumult?
If Stanford really wants to put over a successful
dance, why can't we have more bands like Harry
Owens' or Chuck Foster's? The popular approval by
intelligent people mid the musicianship of these bands
is indisputable; and further, it is possible to DANCE,
to them, not just vibrate like an electric drill.
Yours for Good Music,
Smooth

NON-REPRESENTATIVE REPRESENTATION

HTHE EDITOR, SIR:
Your editorial of March 1 refers to the "fight"
of the "campus" against Finnish relief. I am not aware
that the campus made any such fight. If you are
proud of the "fight" of The Daily, please take specific
credit for it. It is unfair to represent yourself (or the
Executive Committee of the A.S.S.U.) as speaking for
the campus on any such issue.
