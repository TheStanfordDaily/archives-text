ALL TIIE THINGS YOU ARE
I "J EAR SWEETHEART:
Now that Spring is here I figure I had better get
romantic and tell you how much 1 love you, how beau
tiful you are, and that sort of thing. But popular song
writers have made this business rather difficult. They
have cornered so damn many things that a chap's
love ought to be that it all gets very confusing.
If you were really "the tops" you would be, to men
tion a few, "all these things": "a melody," "as i-e
-freshing as a white gardenia," "the promised breath of
Springtime,' "the angel glow that lights the stars," "the
dearest things I know," "a Schiaparelli gown," "a red
rose in Spring," "an angel on the east side of heaven,"
"a mint julep," "the bubbles in a glass of cham
pagne," "a heat wave," and, in plain old-folksy lan
guage, "a sweetheart."
Frankly, if you put all those things together—from
a mint julep to an angel—l think you would have the
most ridiculous looking gargoyle since Frankenstein's
monster. But fashionable romanticists say that you
are actually all those things. And I don't want you to
be old-fashioned, lest you slip off into the category of
supplanting wine by drinking to me only with thine
eyes.

I>UT the hazards of making love to you don't stop
with trying to get a human being out of Holly
wood's descriptions. Just look what I would have to
do if I wanted to prove my undying affection: "pluck
the stars out of the blue," "spank you and thank you
for all you've done," "tie a string around the world
and give it afl to you," "have you under my skin
night and day," "have smoke get in my eyes," and
(most difficult of all) "be faithful for ever and ever
dear." After all, I am not, as you know, Hercules.
Why should I be given all these labors?
And then if I should ever be driven so completely
mad as to write a poem to you, I would have to fill
up the lines with rhymes like these: dove-love-above,
blue-you-true, June-moon-tune, arms-charms, tears
years, and heart-apart. After filling a page with stuff
like that, I would have to say, "believe it, beloved,"
because almost everyone else has.
To summarize my predicament, dearest, I may say
that writing love-letters isn't what it used to be—be
fore Irving Berlin and Cole Porter began to glut the
market. But I trust you will understand what I am
up against. Anyway, maybe you can get along with
out love-letters very well.
Here's hoping,
Sherm
