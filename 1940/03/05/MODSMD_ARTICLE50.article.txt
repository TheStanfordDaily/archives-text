Down at Sunnyvale, where there are a lot of pecu
liar things besides a mammoth hangar, they have a
school for dogs.
A smart dog can get a diploma in six weeks. Like
all graduates, after he gets out he wonders what the
hell good it is, but he at least can remember that he
has been to school and he can say he does have a
diploma, and that makes him different.
A dumb dog flunks out in two weeks; and goes
home to his mamma to live in the lap of luxury.
One woman who had her dog in school asked to
have him back every week-end. 1, 1 get so lonesome
for him," she said.
They wouldn't let her have him. It would spoil him,
they said. He wouldn't be properly educated then,
they said.
One dog, they say, was so spoiled that every time
they told him to do anything, he sat down and cried.
Well, if the women who own these dogs would
rather have that dog school than marriage or free
love or something, it's all right with me.

When the guy drove up in front of Encina with his
date the other night and yelled for the guy whose light
he saw on the third floor, both he and the date were
quite surprised to see the guy come to the window
stark naked.
The guy was equally surprised to see the female.
"Oh, pardon me," he said. "I was just shaving."
