# Eve Curie Tells Colorful Story of Parent's Lives
## 
### 
A life devoted to science and the
achievements of that life was the
subject of the lecture by Eve Curie
last night. Mile. Curie wove into her
tale of the research and experiment
I that culminated in the isolation of
the precious element, the picture of
"a woman following an all-consum
ing passion"â€”Madame Marie Curie.
Tracing the narrative of her par
ents' work from the first meeting of
Marie Skodovska and Pierre Curie
in 1894, she told a tale of indefa
tigable devotion and unselfish col
laboration.
REFUSE PATENT
The study of uranium rays led to
the realization of the existence of
radium in 1898. But the greatest
I part of the work, the isolation of the
Intractable element, lay ahead. There
followed four years of minute re
search and sheer physical labor.
It was necessary for the fragile
Polish woman to treat tons of pitch
blende residue in order to extract a
minute quantity of radium. Once
this was accomplished the Curies
literally threw away a fortune by
refusing to take out patents, thus
giving the fruits of their labor to
the world.
GET NOBEL PIIIZE
Although the award of the Nobel
Prize to the Curies brought fame, it
brought no happiness. "Fame was
the enemy of their work," declared
Mile. Curie.
She concluded, "The Madame Cu
rie whose love of research made her
world famous kept the secret of a
j simple, valiant life."
