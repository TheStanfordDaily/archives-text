### WILSON CANNON 
WPRING is almost here.
* A season which on the Farm
means Lake Lagunita, convertibles,
and a search for 15 easy units. The
lime of year when things in gen
eral look brightest.
But to the war-bound continent
across the sea the approach of
spring brings the threat that armies
on the Western Front will swing
literally into high gear. For spring
thaws will make the extensive use
of mechanized units and equipment
feasible.
For more than six months the
spotlight of world interest lias
been focused upon the Maginot-
Siegfried theater of war. Dress re
hearsals have been almost contin
uous, but each principal in the
grim play lias done his part to
postpone opening night until spring
weather sets the stage.
Yesterday one member of the
neutral audience let the box office
know she hadn't cancelled her or
chestra seat.
Little Switzerland, self-styled
"neutral of neutrals," speeded up
military preparations to an extent
that will make her the'most heavily
mobilized nation in the world in
proportion to her population. Close
to 70,0U0 men reported yesterday,
swelling the Swiss army to over
450,000.
#<«>{<
SIGNIFICANT is the fact that the
k major portion of Swiss armed
forces are concentrated on the Ger
man frontier, while only small
guard units are stationed along the
French border.
Yesterday, highways leading to the
Reich frontier were jammed with
green-grey clad Swiss soldiers rang
ing from 18 to (>0 years of age. Each
of these reserves has already had at
least six weeks' active training.
On the German-Swiss border,
massed on the tangent between the
towns of Basle and Schaffhausen,
are openly displayed Swiss anti
tank and anti-aircraft batteries . . .
ready for instant action.
(United Press dispatches, how
ever, emphasize flic fact that a
conscious effort not to irritate
Germany or any other belligerent
is strongly apparent.)
That Switzerland is taking her
military preparations seriously is
evidenced by reports which tell of
soldiers being blindfolded by their
officers before being taken into
fortresses facing the German border.
This secrecy, it is said, is partly to
guard vital information *and partly
to prevent soldiers from talking
about any preparations.

r |MIE gallant Swiss took their
preparations seriously during
World War I . . . contemporary his
torians credit them with being so
well prepared that Germany took
the other outlet—Belgium—en route
to France because they were wary
of the Swiss legions.
The same intense national spirit
that was present in I!) 14 is pres
ent today. 'The cost of living has
risen tremendously; trade has
suffered; freight rates have climb
ed; other factors have contributed
to hard times . . . hut flic Swiss
are not complaining. They are
determined to preserve their neu
trality even if it takes the last man.
Conscripts while not on duty keep
their equipment at home. Army
regulations permit them to use their
rifles for target practice any time
they wish. The Swiss are already
world-famous for their marksman
ship.
Even the women are ready to join
their men-folk on the front, if need
should arise. Plans for an instanta
neous mobilization of women have
already been completed by the Lau
sanne government.
The Lion of Lucerne is stirring,
the lilies of France are still be
tween its paws.

Yesterday one member of the
neutral audience let the box office
know she hadn't cancelled her or

Little Switzerland, self-styled
"neutral of neutrals," speeded up
military preparations to an extent
that will make her the'most heavily
mobilized nation in the world in
proportion to her population. Close
to 70,0U0 men reported yesterday,
swelling the Swiss army to over
450,000.

SIGNIFICANT is the fact that the
k major portion of Swiss armed
forces are concentrated on the Ger
man frontier, while only small
guard units are stationed along the
French border.
Yesterday, highways leading to the
Reich frontier were jammed with
green-grey clad Swiss soldiers rang
ing from 18 to (>0 years of age. Each
of these reserves has already had at
least six weeks' active training.
On the German-Swiss border,
massed on the tangent between the
towns of Basle and Schaffhausen,
are openly displayed Swiss anti
tank and anti-aircraft batteries . . .
ready for instant action.
(United Press dispatches, how
ever, emphasize flic fact that a
conscious effort not to irritate
Germany or any other belligerent
is strongly apparent.)
That Switzerland is taking her
military preparations seriously is
evidenced by reports which tell of
soldiers being blindfolded by their
officers before being taken into
fortresses facing the German border.
This secrecy, it is said, is partly to
guard vital information *and partly
to prevent soldiers from talking
about any preparations.
