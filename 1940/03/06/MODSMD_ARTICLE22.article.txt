# Curie Relates Activities In War-Ridden France
## Raids Force Schools into Country, Women Take Over Men's Positions 
### ROSE DOUGLASS 
The schools and universities of France have adjusted themselves to
the war and are now carrying on their usual work. Mile. Eve Curie
said in an interview Monday night.
Rigid air-raid protection regulations, however, have forced some
schols to decrease their enrollment, and others have moved from the

larger cities, she added.
Mile. Curie expressed the feeling |
that the w;tr may indirectly lead to I
the increase of co-education in
French schools. Under normal con- I
<lit ions students are, for the most !
part, segregated; but in removing!
young people to the country, it was j
necessary in many places to estab- 1
lish schools for both girl and boy I
students.
The luxury trades, Mile Curie de- 1
clared, have suffered most; the eco- j
nomic warfare has curtailed their |
export business, and cut down their
sale at home. She emphasized that
it was necessary, even in war-time,
I<> protect these businesses, because
much of the prosperity of France
depends upon them.
Speaking of her own work as di
rector of women employees now
filling places left vacant by men at I
the front, she laughed and said, "Oh, |
1 don't do much; my job is just to j
help the employers find women to j
carry on the work."
