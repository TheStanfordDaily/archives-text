cent Congressional proposals to
make technical advancements in
U. S. equipment available to South
and Central American nations.

government had agreed to take (he
artillery "as is" and "where is." The
Army still has nine of the old-type
guns left.
GOOD NEIGHBOR POLICY
The War Department report on
surplus stocks showed they con
sisted primarily of several thousand
British Enfield shoulder rifles, about
70,000 British and French 30-caliber
machine guns designed principally
for mounting on aircraft, about 300
British 755, more than 250 British
eight-inch howitzers with ammuni

guns, more than 200 Stokes mor
tars and about 100,000 shells.
It was pointed out the Brazilian
sale is in keeping with the Presi

Latin America. It also recalled re

WASHINGTON, March 5 (UP).
—The War Department made its
first sale of old World War
equipment to Brazil today and
afterwards informed President
Roosevelt it still has on hand
large stocks of 1!)1X rifles, artil
lery, machine guns and ammuni
tion which can foe sold to non
belligerent nations friendly to the
United States.
The Brazilian sale, involving 90
six-inch field guns, followed Mr.
Roosevelt's recent order for a sur
vey of Army and Navy surplus
stocks with a view to selling them
under an act passed in 1920. Swed
en and Haiti also are understood to
be interested in purchases of this
type of war equipment which the
Army and Navy no longer use.
CONDITION GOOD
War Department officials stressed
that the equipment is fully service
able and in good condition. How
ever, its use has been supplaned in
the U. S. Army by newly developed
or improved models.
The price at which the six-inch
guns were sold was not disclosed,
but authoritative sources said it was
low. One official said the Brazilian
government had agreed to take (he
artillery "as is" and "where is." The
Army still has nine of the old-type
guns left.
