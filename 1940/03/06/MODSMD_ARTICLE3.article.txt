# Excom Sets Aside Hank's No. 7 Jersey
## Committee Approves 8 Block S Awards, 15 Frosh Numerals 
### 
Never again will a Stanford bas
ketball player wear number 7—
the number that llank Luisctti
made famous two years ago.
Action takin/.; the number out of
circulation was taken last night by
Ex Committee, which also au
thorized President Ken Cuthbert
son to investigate the possibility of
placing Luisctti's number 7 jer
sey in the Stanford trophy room.
"Sterilising" the number was first
suggested by Walt Peterson, Daily
sports editor two years ago. Twice
this quarter The Daily has recom
mended such action through Sideline
Slants.
The committee's action followed a
report by Hill Rapp, who had been
asked to investigate the situation.
TALKED WITII COACHES
After conversations with Dean
John Bunn, former basketball coach,
Everett Dean, present coach, and
some of Luisctti's teammates, Rapp
reported there was no objection to
taking the number out of play. He
said that action was not taken two
years ago because of the recent re
fusal to put Bobby Grayson's num
ber aside.
Committeemen agreed the jersey
itself should be taken out of play if
possible—"the genuine, moth-eaten,
original one."
"Taking the number out of circu
lation won't make much of an im
pression—the actual jersey or an old
shoe is what counts," suggested
Arch Jenkins, Daily editor.
Acting on recommendations from
coaches and the Board of Athletic
Control, Ex Committee approved
the granting of eight block S awards
and 15 block numerals.
The following varsity basketball
players were awarded block S:
Forrest Anderson, Bill Cowden,
Ken Davidson, Leon Lafaille, Bob
Penn, Dick Taylor, Bob Wensel, and
Don Williams.
The following frosh basketball
players were awarded block nu
merals:
Ed Agnew, Jack Dana, John
Eikelman, Verne Freeman, Walter
Funabiki, Fred Linari, Leo McCaf
frey, Ross Meyer, Hank Norbcrg,
Dick Northon, Henry Plate, Ed
Stamm, Jim Sullivan, Ed Voss, and
Russell Vail (for exceptional work.)
Bill Rapp and Mary June Mont
gomery were appointed a committee
to consider the general provisions
for block S awards and awards on
the basis of exceptional work. By
laws may be changed by Ex Com
mittee next Tuesday as a result of
this committee's report, it was in
dicated.

night follows:

AID FOR SIGHTLESS: John Por

G.G.I.E. DUCATS; Mrs. Rose Hen
dy, Santa Clara county ticket chair
man for the 1040 fair, outlined to
Ex Committee a money-making
scheme involving sale of fair tick
ets on the campus.
Committeemen rejected the pro
posal on grounds it would not be a
legitimate A.S.S.U. function, being
"purely a commercial project"; that
it would set a dangerous precedent;
that the tickets might not sell; and
that such a venture would tend to
jeopardize the success of the Con
valescent Home Drive.

it was impossible," said Mrs. Hendy.

"purely a commercial project"; that
it would set a dangerous precedent;
that the tickets might not sell; and
that such a venture would tend to

John Bunn, former basketball coach,
Everett Dean, present coach, and

Committeemen agreed the jersey
itself should be taken out of play if
possible—"the genuine, moth-eaten,
original one."
"Taking the number out of circu

shoe is what counts," suggested
Arch Jenkins, Daily editor.

Never again will a Stanford bas
ketball player wear number 7—
the number that llank Luisctti
made famous two years ago.
Action takin/.; the number out of
circulation was taken last night by
Ex Committee, which also au
thorized President Ken Cuthbert
son to investigate the possibility of
placing Luisctti's number 7 jer
sey in the Stanford trophy room.
"Sterilising" the number was first
suggested by Walt Peterson, Daily
sports editor two years ago. Twice
this quarter The Daily has recom
mended such action through Sideline
Slants.
The committee's action followed a
report by Hill Rapp, who had been
asked to investigate the situation.
TALKED WITII COACHES
After conversations with Dean
John Bunn, former basketball coach,
Everett Dean, present coach, and
some of Luisctti's teammates, Rapp
reported there was no objection to
taking the number out of play. He
said that action was not taken two
years ago because of the recent re
fusal to put Bobby Grayson's num
ber aside.
Committeemen agreed the jersey
itself should be taken out of play if
possible—"the genuine, moth-eaten,
original one."
"Taking the number out of circu
lation won't make much of an im
pression—the actual jersey or an old
shoe is what counts," suggested
Arch Jenkins, Daily editor.
Acting on recommendations from
coaches and the Board of Athletic
Control, Ex Committee approved
the granting of eight block S awards
and 15 block numerals.
The following varsity basketball
players were awarded block S:
Forrest Anderson, Bill Cowden,
Ken Davidson, Leon Lafaille, Bob
Penn, Dick Taylor, Bob Wensel, and
Don Williams.
The following frosh basketball
players were awarded block nu
merals:
Ed Agnew, Jack Dana, John
Eikelman, Verne Freeman, Walter
Funabiki, Fred Linari, Leo McCaf
frey, Ross Meyer, Hank Norbcrg,
Dick Northon, Henry Plate, Ed
