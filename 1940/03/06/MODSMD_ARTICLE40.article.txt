# Texas Mermen Face Cards Today
## Noted Divers Head Strong Steer Team Texans Eight Times Winners of Southwest Swim Championship 
### 
Complete with their "flying cir
cus" trio of nationally famous div
ers, the University of Texas Long
horns invade Encina Pools this ai
ternoon at 4 o'clock in the role of
heavy favorite for an important dual
meet with Coach Nort Thornton's
Indian swimming team. The meet
will be open to the public.
Eight times winner of the South
west Conference tank title and
fifth-place winers in last year's
N.C.A.A. meet, the Steers boast one
of the most powerful and best-bal
anced swim squads in the nation.
This is Texas' first invasion of the
Pacific Coast and they are expected
to take the weak Stanford team right
in - stride.
STEER STARS
Coached by a former Michigan
star, Tex Robertson, the Longhorns
feature several Southwestern Con
ference champions, including Cap
tain Bob Tarlton, outstanding back
stroke and individual medley per
lormer, Harris McClamroch, who
set a new conference mark for the
100-yard free-style last season, and
Bill Chuniski, defending 220 'and 440
champ.
Bill Brink heads the Longhorn's
famed flying circus, which also in
cludes two former Fullerton J. C.
diving stars. Brink placed third at
the National A.A.U. outdoor cham
pionships in the tower diving event
and his dual with Stanford's Howie
Adams should be one of the high
lights of the meet. The other two
men are Hank Chapman and Babe
Papich, with whom coast diving fans
are already familiar.
STANFORD MAINSTAY
Big Boy Vitousek, Farm co-cap
tain, will carry most of the burden
for Stanford and Coach Thornton is
relying on the Honolulu blond for
victories in the 50-yard freestyle
and the 200-yard breaststroke.
In the breaststroke, Vitousek will
meet the "flying fish twins," Mike
Sojka and Dick Beeler, experts at
the Hying breaststroke. Sojka has
placed second in the 200-yard
breaststroke at the A.A.U. meet for
two years and is consistent at around
2:36.
Bill Weeden of Stanford faces
Tarlton in the 150-yard backstroke
in one of the feature events. Both
men are champions in their respec
tive conferences.
With the outcome of the meet
hinging upon the 220, 440, and re
lay, all weak events for the Indians,
the Texas boys loom as heavy fa
vorites for this afternoon's clash.

BOSTON. March 5 (UP).â€”Eighty
five-year-old Mrs. Lois A. Mitchell
is "delighted" at the amazement of
spectators whenever she skates over
the frozen lagoon in the Public Gar
den. Working hard and playing
hard is the way to keep young, ac
cording to the 98-pound, 5-foot
woman, who works as a furrier.
