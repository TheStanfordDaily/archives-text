# Cal, Card Boxing Captains to Clash
## 
### 
A "battle of the century" looms
I tomorrow night in Encina Pavilion
when Jack Rice and Jules Droub
day, each a middleweight and each
the captain of his team, meet for the
| eighth time as Clayton Frye's box
i ers engage the Cal team in the wind-
J up of the season.
| Both men have won three times,
i and their last meeting at Cal two
I weeks ago ended in a draw—a rarity
in college boxing.
This is a pivotal battle—if Cap
j tain Jack can come through to
i morrow. Coach Frye hopes to reverse
j the team verdict Cal won at Berke
! ley. On the strength of the other
! boxers' showings in their last fights,
| Frye and Assistant Coach Bill Wil
] ber are anticipating hard-fought,
[close battles throughout the card.
