The Gaels poked over the winning j
run in the eighth frame of that j
game on some loose Bear fielding.
St. Mary's only loss was to Santa |
Clara in the opening game of the j
season. The Cards have gained an
even break in two games against the '
Brones, losing a 2-1 heart-breaker j
on the hazardous Pruneville field
and then coming back to breeze to a j
G-3 win behind Cootie Thompson's j
five-hit pitching.
If O'Niell, a right-handed chucker, j
does start in the box, the Stanford
line-up will be the same that opened
the last two games, according to
Wolter. '

| Lewis working behind the plate, Hal
I Costello at first, Harry Parsons at
[ second, Elton Boone at third and
Monty Pfyl at short. Norm Juney,
