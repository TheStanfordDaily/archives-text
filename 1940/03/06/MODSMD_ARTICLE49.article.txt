# Swedish Relief
## 
### 
YESTERDAY morning's Daily authoritatively
reported that Stanford's administrators are
considering the possibility that the Farm may
become the training grounfl for 200 Swedish
airmen.
At this point the whole thing is extremely
tentative. A limited number of facts are avail
able. We do know that a representative of the
Swedish government, a submarine commander,
was present on the Stanford campus last week.
We know that he conferred informally with Dr.
Wilbur and Professor David Webster. He visited
the Palo Alto airport with a view to considering
its facilities for military aviation training.
More than this we do not know, except that
the Swedish consulate in San Francisco con
firmed the fact that their representative* was
investigating the possibility of training pilots on
the Farm.
The disadvantages of such a plan are so ob
vious they scarcely need reiteration. Sweden,
currently neutral in name at least, is obviously
assisting Finland in a military way. There is
every assurance that she will continue to aid
the Finns—as long as there are any Finns left.
And, furthermore, there is a strong possibility
that Sweden will be unable to stay out of World
War 11. If the Soviet advance continues, and if
fighting flares along the Western Front in the
next few months, Sweden may be unable to
preserve even her present nominal neutrality.
For all practical purposes, then, Sweden is
no neutral.
The procedure of training pilots of a "semi
belligerent" nation in a completely neutral
country is, I believe, unprecedented. That
Stanford should be the site of such training is
still more discouraging. The advocates of Fin
nish relief had an arguing point. They asserted
that they were assisting unfortunates—women
and children placed at the mercy of wartime
aggression.
But the proponents of this plan to train avia
tors in America have no such argument. No
matter how the issue is considered, this coach
ing of pilots would be definitely military. And
it would be un-neutral. It would mean training
men for a clear purpose—the destruction of
other men (and possibly women and children).
To train such aviators—flyers of a foreign and
belligerent nation—at Stanford would be a re
grettable move.
At a time when neutrality is so urgently pur
sued and so easily lost, let Stanford, at least,
retain a reasonably free, liberal, unbiased atti
tude.—D. H.

belligerent nation—at Stanford would be a re
grettable move.
At a time when neutrality is so urgently pur
sued and so easily lost, let Stanford, at least,
retain a reasonably free, liberal, unbiased atti
tude.—D. H.
YESTERDAY morning's Daily authoritatively
reported that Stanford's administrators are
considering the possibility that the Farm may
become the training grounfl for 200 Swedish
airmen.
At this point the whole thing is extremely
tentative. A limited number of facts are avail
able. We do know that a representative of the
Swedish government, a submarine commander,
was present on the Stanford campus last week.
We know that he conferred informally with Dr.
Wilbur and Professor David Webster. He visited
the Palo Alto airport with a view to considering
its facilities for military aviation training.
More than this we do not know, except that
the Swedish consulate in San Francisco con
firmed the fact that their representative* was
investigating the possibility of training pilots on
the Farm.
The disadvantages of such a plan are so ob
vious they scarcely need reiteration. Sweden,
currently neutral in name at least, is obviously
assisting Finland in a military way. There is
every assurance that she will continue to aid
the Finns—as long as there are any Finns left.
And, furthermore, there is a strong possibility
that Sweden will be unable to stay out of World
War 11. If the Soviet advance continues, and if
fighting flares along the Western Front in the
next few months, Sweden may be unable to
preserve even her present nominal neutrality.
For all practical purposes, then, Sweden is
no neutral.
The procedure of training pilots of a "semi
belligerent" nation in a completely neutral
country is, I believe, unprecedented. That
Stanford should be the site of such training is
still more discouraging. The advocates of Fin
nish relief had an arguing point. They asserted
that they were assisting unfortunates—women
and children placed at the mercy of wartime
aggression.
But the proponents of this plan to train avia
tors in America have no such argument. No
matter how the issue is considered, this coach
ing of pilots would be definitely military. And
it would be un-neutral. It would mean training
men for a clear purpose—the destruction of
other men (and possibly women and children).
To train such aviators—flyers of a foreign and
belligerent nation—at Stanford would be a re
grettable move.

sued and so easily lost, let Stanford, at least,
