QUASIMODO WALKS

r |MIE EDITOR, SIR:
My, how I wish I were the Super-Man, so that I
could stride to Paly with no effort at all. Once
in a blue moon yours truly goes into that haven of
merchants t'other side of the S.P. tracks and transacts
business there. Once upon a time yours truly also had
a Model A Ford in which he took thumbing Stanford
waifs into Paly on his way down. But now I have no
car so must either take the infrequent bus or thumb
a ride. Knowing that Stanford students are gentlemen
and gentlewomen I stood at an appropriate corner where
all the cars must pass on the way to Paly. For 30
minutes (1:47 p.m. to 2:17 p.m.) I stood on this corner
awaiting a ride. People passed by in all sorts of cars
-pink ones, yellow ones, grey ones. Some had merely
the driver, some were big like busses, and had only
two people. Acquaintances of mine who drove the
car- offered me encouragement by waving their hands
to me; others looked at me and laughed as they passed
by.
I looked down at my clothes—no, I had them
cleaned just a few days ago, so they wouldn't soil
anyone's car. 1 did not have a cigarette in hand; no
ashes would go on the floor or burn the upholstery.
Perhaps this ugly face of mine (a mirror proves it)
was scaring them away. 1 smiled, I nearly held my
hands up in prayer to passing cars but to no avail. I
was desperate: I had to into Paly. No bus, plenty
of cars with plenty of room—but no ride.
Finally, there came a Model A Fold—oh! irony,
it was just like the one with which I used to take
people into Paly. The driver courteously offered me a
ride and took me into Paly.
Coming back I got stuck on Palm Drive and cars,
what few came over that man-made desert of the
Drive passed bv. except one who offered me a ride.
It's a uood thing we were by the hospital because
when I swooned I might have knocked my head
ayamst a rock and been hurt. But he picked me up
and took mc in. I've traveled on box-cars, and in an
old Model T, but that trip to Paly was the most
grueling I ever took. Perhaps Tony Cefaratti and I
shouldn't have done that "Hide to Paly" thing in the
benefit show it gave people the wrong impression of
hitch-hikers on campus.

Why not make dark suits optional and tuxes the
rule for the .Junior Prom? After all, the big dance of
the quarter deserve* considerable prestige, eelat, joie
• l«• vivir, and Ijon vivant, it you pursue tne.

At id also I wish to take exception to Smooth's
I plea for sweet music. This type of commercial trash,
also known to the trade as oosh music, is all very well
for spots who wish to get mediocre musicianship for
a corresponding fee. But let me assert at this point
that the jump-jump bands can outplay the commer
cial bands in every department—smoothness, rhythm,
and melody.
To make this quite clear, Goodman, Shaw, Dorsey,
and Norvo have at times put on little acts in which
they imitate Lombardo, Garber, Freddy Martin, and
other current style bands. Very creditable imitations
they were, too. But you'll never hear Lombardo imi
tating Goodman. It takes real musicians to play swing
and exhibit free improvisation at its best.

I Why not make a feature of reprinting every day
one of Mellinkoff's columns in which he does not criti
cize something? It seems to me that if the world is
the kind of place where something is wrong with
everything, as Mr. Mellinkoff seems to think, a little
spreading of joy and uncritical spirit would help it
along.
This suggestion of mine would also be good in that
it. would save The Daily so much to fill with U.P.
feature stories.

PS.: My roommate says to add a few words to this
vitriolic piece of satire:
"If Mr. Mellinkoff has to criticize Mr. Mellinkoff in
the person of Hortense Figgins, in order to get some
thing to criticize, the value of his column certainly
' must be slight."

that the jump-jump bands can outplay the commer
cial bands in every department—smoothness, rhythm,
and melody.
To make this quite clear, Goodman, Shaw, Dorsey,
and Norvo have at times put on little acts in which
they imitate Lombardo, Garber, Freddy Martin, and
other current style bands. Very creditable imitations
they were, too. But you'll never hear Lombardo imi

awaiting a ride. People passed by in all sorts of cars

the driver, some were big like busses, and had only
two people. Acquaintances of mine who drove the

to me; others looked at me and laughed as they passed

that the jump-jump bands can outplay the commer

and melody.
To make this quite clear, Goodman, Shaw, Dorsey,

they imitate Lombardo, Garber, Freddy Martin, and
other current style bands. Very creditable imitations
they were, too. But you'll never hear Lombardo imi

I Why not make a feature of reprinting every day
one of Mellinkoff's columns in which he does not criti
cize something? It seems to me that if the world is
the kind of place where something is wrong with
everything, as Mr. Mellinkoff seems to think, a little
spreading of joy and uncritical spirit would help it
along.
This suggestion of mine would also be good in that
it. would save The Daily so much to fill with U.P.
feature stories.

PS.: My roommate says to add a few words to this
vitriolic piece of satire:
"If Mr. Mellinkoff has to criticize Mr. Mellinkoff in
the person of Hortense Figgins, in order to get some
thing to criticize, the value of his column certainly
' must be slight."

My, how I wish I were the Super-Man, so that I
could stride to Paly with no effort at all. Once
in a blue moon yours truly goes into that haven of
merchants t'other side of the S.P. tracks and transacts
business there. Once upon a time yours truly also had
a Model A Ford in which he took thumbing Stanford
waifs into Paly on his way down. But now I have no
car so must either take the infrequent bus or thumb
a ride. Knowing that Stanford students are gentlemen
and gentlewomen I stood at an appropriate corner where
all the cars must pass on the way to Paly. For 30
minutes (1:47 p.m. to 2:17 p.m.) I stood on this corner
awaiting a ride. People passed by in all sorts of cars
-pink ones, yellow ones, grey ones. Some had merely
the driver, some were big like busses, and had only
two people. Acquaintances of mine who drove the
car- offered me encouragement by waving their hands
to me; others looked at me and laughed as they passed
by.
I looked down at my clothes—no, I had them
cleaned just a few days ago, so they wouldn't soil
anyone's car. 1 did not have a cigarette in hand; no
ashes would go on the floor or burn the upholstery.
Perhaps this ugly face of mine (a mirror proves it)
was scaring them away. 1 smiled, I nearly held my
hands up in prayer to passing cars but to no avail. I
was desperate: I had to into Paly. No bus, plenty
of cars with plenty of room—but no ride.
Finally, there came a Model A Fold—oh! irony,
it was just like the one with which I used to take
people into Paly. The driver courteously offered me a
ride and took me into Paly.
Coming back I got stuck on Palm Drive and cars,
what few came over that man-made desert of the
Drive passed bv. except one who offered me a ride.
It's a uood thing we were by the hospital because
when I swooned I might have knocked my head
ayamst a rock and been hurt. But he picked me up
and took mc in. I've traveled on box-cars, and in an
old Model T, but that trip to Paly was the most
grueling I ever took. Perhaps Tony Cefaratti and I
shouldn't have done that "Hide to Paly" thing in the
benefit show it gave people the wrong impression of
hitch-hikers on campus.
