### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
ALL S IIIGHT WITH THE WORLD
J>EAL journalists have advised me that it is a bad
policy to answer Campus Opinion letters in public.
And I had just about resigned myself to public silence
on all letters but Hortense's, But from one of this
morning's commentators came a diatribe that puts me
in this odd position: To answer Hortense, The Daily's
dream girl, I must first answer those who answer
Hortense.
Campus Opinioner is one of a group of skeptics
who seems to think that I am Hortense and Hortense
is I. In so far as he means to say that Hortense
hasn't a whole mind of her own, I agree with him.
But how he can have been driven so completely faith
less as to guess that Hortense springs from what is
smilingly called my mind is beyond me. At an early
age he must have dreamed of shredded wheat and
awakened to find himself chewing the mattress. Few
other things could have made him so mistrustful.
Why anyone should call himself a "crock of sour
grape juice" under a pseudonym I don't quite know.
But "C.J." seems to think he has the answer. Roughly,
it must go like this: I am so hypercritical, such a
nasty pessimist, that I am even driven to criticize my
self, under the pen-name of Hortense Figgins.
* # * *
TO DISCLAIM any identity (or more than bitter
relationship) with Miss Figgins is to put the matter
very politely. But it is not so much being accused of
masquerading under the name of Hortense that dis
turbs me. The really exasperating thing is to be called
so cynical that I cannot find anything good in the
world—even myself.
Along with this morning's optimistic writer, I have
seen the sun showering its oh-so-sunny beams on
Lake Lagunita. I have heard the cute little birds twit
tering in the trees and, as he likes to put it. "spreading
joy in the world." And the cloud-veiled stars never
cease to inspire me with that "uncritical spirit" that
"helps the world along."
I have even pondered over the fact that there really
must be some good in the European War. The spring
time flowers, for example, will no doubt be much
more fragrant as a result of the carrion-made fer
tilizer that, will seep into their little roots —carrying
on the great mystery of life all about us.
It isn't that I am a cynic whose eyes are closed
to the great, wide, beautiful world. It is just that
Campus Opinion writers are so much better at
"spreading joy in the world."
But let's set aside today for a cheerful, optimistic
view of things. Let's just define the world as a warm
place inhabited by butterflies.

But "C.J." seems to think he has the answer. Roughly,
it must go like this: I am so hypercritical, such a
nasty pessimist, that I am even driven to criticize my
self, under the pen-name of Hortense Figgins.

TO DISCLAIM any identity (or more than bitter
relationship) with Miss Figgins is to put the matter
very politely. But it is not so much being accused of
masquerading under the name of Hortense that dis
turbs me. The really exasperating thing is to be called
so cynical that I cannot find anything good in the
world—even myself.
Along with this morning's optimistic writer, I have
seen the sun showering its oh-so-sunny beams on
Lake Lagunita. I have heard the cute little birds twit
tering in the trees and, as he likes to put it. "spreading
joy in the world." And the cloud-veiled stars never
cease to inspire me with that "uncritical spirit" that
"helps the world along."
I have even pondered over the fact that there really
must be some good in the European War. The spring
time flowers, for example, will no doubt be much
more fragrant as a result of the carrion-made fer
tilizer that, will seep into their little roots —carrying
on the great mystery of life all about us.
It isn't that I am a cynic whose eyes are closed
to the great, wide, beautiful world. It is just that
Campus Opinion writers are so much better at
"spreading joy in the world."
But let's set aside today for a cheerful, optimistic
view of things. Let's just define the world as a warm

J>EAL journalists have advised me that it is a bad
policy to answer Campus Opinion letters in public.
And I had just about resigned myself to public silence
on all letters but Hortense's, But from one of this
morning's commentators came a diatribe that puts me
in this odd position: To answer Hortense, The Daily's
dream girl, I must first answer those who answer
Hortense.
Campus Opinioner is one of a group of skeptics
who seems to think that I am Hortense and Hortense
is I. In so far as he means to say that Hortense
hasn't a whole mind of her own, I agree with him.
But how he can have been driven so completely faith
less as to guess that Hortense springs from what is
smilingly called my mind is beyond me. At an early
age he must have dreamed of shredded wheat and
awakened to find himself chewing the mattress. Few
other things could have made him so mistrustful.
Why anyone should call himself a "crock of sour
grape juice" under a pseudonym I don't quite know.
