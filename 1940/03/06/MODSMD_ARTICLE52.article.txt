### DOUG JAQUES 
TO A I)AIIK LADY

When the drunk woman at the bar said, "You look
like Clark Gable," I got the hell out.
When the female in the flashy clothes said, "You
know, some day I'd like to drink all the champagne
I could," I quickly introduced her to a friend of mine
When the small blonde said, "Do you like double
ring weddings?" I said, "That's what my last wife
asked me," and she got the hell out.
When the girl in the first grade said, "Will you be
my boy friend, huh?" I said, "For how long."
Hut when you said, "Come into my parlor," I came
in. liqhtly and politely.
That was two years ago. I have let you lead me
on for two long years. "Now can I have a date?" I
would ask, and you would say. "Later." I tried Yard
ley's, Ipana, and lettuce. I ate fish, read thick books,
learned a poem, and once tried to write a sonnet
(which I finished as a dirty limerick). Nothing has
done any good.
Time after time I have gagged my way into your
parlor, and you have gagged me right on out again.
You have made ty/o brunettes and a blonde very
jealous. They just raised hell with me. But did I
give you up? Even when they said no more necking?
Well. no.
You have never been faithful to me. But at least
you have done me the courtesy to cavort (how faun
like that sounds) with men I don't know.
But, lady, make a note of this: If you don't stop
flirting with mv small, dark colleague, I'm going to
come over and blacken youse up.

(I wrote this before you flirted, lady.)
We met in the hot month of May.
, I said, "Mav I come in and play?''
"Don't be 'Mi ass.
You can't make a pass
At a woman whose feet are not clay."
