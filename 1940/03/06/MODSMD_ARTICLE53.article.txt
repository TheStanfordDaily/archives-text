"ANOTHER CYNTHIA," by Doris Ixslic, 011 .sale at (lie Stanford
i Bookstore.
According to Miss Leslie, this is a biography of Cynthia. Each Ffulkes,
i reconstructed from her memoirs whieli were found behind' a secret
| panel in a house in Berkeley Square. That's all very well, aside from the

| minor fact that it is obvious that
I Cynthia, Lady Ffulkes, never existed
jat i» 11 outside Miss Leslie's imagina
; tion, and she should have been left
there.
"Another Cynthia" would have
i been much better if it had been kept
j within the limits of a straight piece
jof light fiction about a beautiful
] actress, no better than she should
j be. who lived in the time of the
Georges, and who, contrary to all
j previous moralistic commentaries on
the subject, ends up a respected,
wealthy woman.
DOESN'T RING TRUE
But. the author keeps interspers
[ ing little bits from her supposedly
j authentic journal. The trouble is
j that the quotes don't ring true.
After the manner of Jeffrey Far-
I nol's rip-roaring adventure stories
j laid in the same period, the charac
{ ters in "Another Cynthia" are uni
| formly dashing, hard-drinking,
j hard-riding, and in general nostal
| gically swashbuckling. It was a
time of easy morals, and Cynthia, up
j from the gutter, has no difficulty in
j finding a young heel who is delight-
I ed to set her up in the style a mis-
I tress of those days required.
Here the story slips out of the
I vein in which it is best, for poor
I Cynthia, faithful to her lover, finds
that it is she who must support the
establishment with her earnings as
an actress.
TAGGED A LADY
She endures numerous hardships,
calculated to take the bloom off any
woman's cheek, including desertion
i by her lover, the death of her baby,
and a bad case of smallpox. How
ever, none of these things harms her
beauty or her lovely soul, and she
winds up conveniently married to a
young man with a social conscience
who has been turning up from time
to time. He, startlingly enough, is a
renegade member of the upper
classes, who is trying tv do some
thing for the working classes. Thus
Cynthia winds up neatly tagged a
lady.
When Cynthia is younger and
struggling tooth and nail for a place
in the half-recognized world of the
theater, the book is good, and the
characters have the fabulous quality
we've come to associate with the
Directoire era. After she begins to
suffer the pangs of true love, she
gets dull, and the book goes right
along with her.—Nowell
