# British Coal Seizure Deals Hard Blow to Neutral Italy
## 
### 
LONDON, March 5 (UP). â€”Britain defied Italy's displeasure by seizing
six Italian ships loaded with German coal today and headed quickly
toward a show-down with the Reich's axis partner.
Four other Italian colliers had left Rotterdam ami it was presumed
they also would be seized by British warships enforcing the Allies' contra
band control.

In the face of a strong Italian pro
test note declaring Britain's embargo
on German coal illegal, Ronald
Cross, Minister of Economic War
fare , reaffirmed Britain's position
and indicated a retreat by London
was unlikely. He told Parliament
today German coal exported by way
of Holland to Italy now is liable to
seizure as a prize of war and an
nounced the first such seizures had
been made.
ESCORTED TO PORT
The Italian ships were escorted
by British warships to The Downs,
British contraband control base
off Deal. They must remain there
until a contraband committee de
cides their fate, normally an
nounced within a few days. The
British Press Association said the
coal would be retained by Brit
ain as a prize of war.
Stoppage of Italian coal shipments
was the hardest blow dealt to the
trade of any neutral nation since
the Allies applied their "reprisals"
blockade of German exports in De
cember, an action they said was
justified by Germany's submarine
and mine warfare.
Germany for years has been
shipping Italy between 5,000,000 and
(5,000,000 tons of coal annually by
sea, and another 3,000,000 to 4,000,000
tons was sent by rail.
BRITAIN TO SELL COAL
Britain, however, seemed ready
to soften the blow and at the same
time help her own economy by
selling Italy British coal on terms
acceptable to Italy.
Negotiations to supplant German
coal with the product of Welsh
mines broke down recently when
Britain insisted on payment in air
plane engines and munitions. Italy
offered to pay with fruits and vege
tables and Premier Mussolini re
fused to jeopardize his friendship
with German Chancellor Adolf Hit
ler by selling arms to the Allies.
