" 'Saturday is absolutely
typical of sorority life," said Dan
Holtom yesterday about Gloria
Workman's one-act play which will
begin a two-night run in the Little
Theater Friday night at ft o'clock.
"Meet Mr. Smith," by Bud Cady,
and "We Shall Not. Sleep," by Ted
Hatlen, completes the trio of win
ners of the Ram's Head one-act.
contest, which will be given Friday
and Saturday.
Miss Workman's play is a sketch
of the regular Saturday night activ
ity in any house up the Rowâ€”girls
going out and girls staying in. The
set will portray a room in any girl's
living group and will reach a new
high in realism, according to Lois
Reldhym, co-technical director of
the one-act.
"Clothes everywhere, you prob
ably won't be able to see the furni
ture for them. One uirl taking ex
ercises, another wandering in in
shower cap and towel, another try
ing to study, a bull-session going
on."
The ;ill-girl cast is as follows: Kay,
Yvonne liazlett; Paula, Bobbo Har
ris; Ginny, Jean Nowell; Carolyn,
Kay Anderson; Sue, Barbara Lom
bardi; Dotty, Joan Woodard; and
Mary Jay, Barbara Hoibron.
The cast of "Meet. Mr. Smith" in
cludes Charles Bulotti, Louise Gold
man, Dan Holtom, Tony Cefaratti,
and Dana Winters.
Holtom has announced that "Back
to the Farm" regalia should bo worn
to the one-acts presentations on Fri
day and Saturday night, also that the
Friday night performance will end
in ample time to attend the dance
that night.
The one-acts can be considered as
part of the "Back to the Farm"
movement, according to Holtcm, be
cause the plays are student-written,
student - directed, and student -
acted. The Ram's Head one-act play
contest, this week-end's plays are
the second group of winners, paral
lels a nation-wide movement toward
the development of collegiate crea
tive drama.
Tickets for the one-acts are 50
cents. Though they are not on rc
'serve, they may be secured by
phoning P.A. 7712.
