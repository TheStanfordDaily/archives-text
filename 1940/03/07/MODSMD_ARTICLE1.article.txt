### WILSON CANNON 
r hand that controls the' English
piece on the European chess
board made a strong move yester
day.
Ignoring a vigorous protest from
Rome, Britain seized as prizes of war
the eoal cargoes of eight Italian
ships en route to their home ports
from Germany. Seven more Italian
ships were intercepted during the
day by the British navy and taken
to the Downs.
England's validation for the move
was the British embargo on German
coal exports which went into effect
at midnight, March 1. It is expected
that the coal will be held for the
duration of the war, as the property
of a neutral. The ships, however,
will be released as soon as the car
goes have been unloaded.
Observers saw in British action
a tacit answer to Monday's for
mally-worded Italian note of pro
test. Unofficial London spokesmen
said that Britain's formal answer
will reject the Italian contention
that the embargo is illegal, but
will be conciliatory in tone.
Members of the enemy exports
committee in England consider that
their action puts the next move
squarely up to Rome.

r JMIA T the Italian government con
siders the issue a vital one was
suggested by the formal tone of all
diplomatic relationships involving
this particular question. They claim
that the coal "represents an immut
able necessity to the life and work
of the Italian people.
A little research shows that, tech
nically speaking, the Italians are
right.
Mussolini's country does lack coal
. . . one of the most necessary of
raw materials. She produces a scanty
4 per cent of her requirements, is
forced to depend entirely upon im
ports for the remainder. Italy indi
cated yesterday, through unofficial
circles, that the crisis might be one
of major magnitude . . . that with
out coal she would be forced to her
economic knees.
Englishmen close (o the enemy
exports committee give a vastly
different angle of the Italian coal
story. One official, who "referred
(o discuss the question anony
mously," made three points in
Britain's stand dear:
(1) Italy is dependent upon for
eign coal; but hardly upon imports
from Nazi Germany.
(2) She can obtain more than
enough coal from nearby friendly
nations. . . .
(3) . . . and, incidentally, Eng
land is one of the greatest coal pro
ducers in the world; mines almost
hall again as much as she needs;
and has a great deal available for
export.

has already offered to
Italy in exchange for Italian
goods a trade which is strongly com
parable to the present barter trans
actions between Italy and Germany.
The English, who have been
watching ships leaving Rome en
route to Germany for coal, see a
logical conclusion that Italy is car
lying munitions for Berlin in ex
change. Just as logically, they sec
no reason why the Italian ships
shouldn't be carrying these cargoes
to England in a swap for Welsh
coal.
And England sees no present
reason why the move shouldn't
be a strong diplomatic victory for
herself; give them a new and
hungry market for their exports
of coal; and add another link to
the economic blockade around
Germany.
The English bulldogs are still
strongest on the sea. Germany
would be at a diplomatic disadvan
tage were she forced to torpedo
Italian coal ships en route from
England. As for the Italians: "Let
them eat cake," says Britain.
