# Farm To See One-Act Plays This Weekend
## 
### 
Ram's Head one-act, plays will be
gin a two-night run tomorrow night
at 8 o'clock, in the Little Theater.
The three plays, "Saturday Night,"
by Gloria Workman, "Meet Mr.
Smith" by Bud Cady, and "We Shall
Not Sleep" by Ted Ilatlen, are win
ners of the recent Ram's Head one
act. play contest.
The contest was inaugurated last
year. In addition to having their
plays presented, the winners auto
matically become members of Ram's
Head, and have their names engrav
ed on the Ram's Head plaque in the
foyer of Memorial Hall. More than
30 scripts were handed in for this
year's contest.
Cady's "Meet Mr. Smith" is a do
mestic comedy, depending on line
and situation for its humors. "Sat
urday Night" is a story of typical
sorority life.
Hatlen's "We Shall Not Sleep" is a
very difficult piny to do, according
to Holtom. A wide variety of scenes
makes it a "problem play" for the
technical stafT. Lois Feldhym and
Pete Wangenheim, technical direc
tors of the one-acts, have mounted
the stylized sets on rollers to facili
tate rapid scene changes.
