# Editor Speaks On Publishing
## Helen Fay Praises New Poeket Editions 
### 
Miss Helen Kay, author, editor,
publisher, was guest speaker at |
Luncheon Club yesterday. Speaking j
on "Making a Book," Miss Fay il- >
lus I rat°d her talk with sample book !
covers, galley proofs and other!
paraphernalia connected with the
business ol book publishing.
In the course of her lecture Miss j
Fay traced the steps in the process
of making a book from the writing
of the story, through the printing |
I process, until the book is bound and J
J ready to be sold. She put forward j
i the suggestion that the author and 1
| illustrator should co-operate, point — I
j ing out that lack of co-ordination of I
I pictures and book, sometimes results !
when artist and author are working
I separately.
, The paper-bound pocket editions
1 of good books recently put on the '
1 market are, in the opinion of Miss !
1 Fay, the smartest move that pub
! Ushers have made recently. More- |
i over, she explained, having read !
I the book the purchaser may return I
the hook to the publishing house j
[ and have the price of the book ap
j plied to the price ol a more valuable J
j book.
As for the reading public, Miss j
i Fay expressed her belief that a book j
should read for itself, not for what 1
I lie author has written before. She'
believes that the critical faculty is j
| sometimes overworked, and de
i elan d that readers should read for j
enjoyment.
Miss Fay is one of the editors of |
I "Story Parade," a child's fiction |
i magazine, and the former juvenile !
] editor ol "Holiday House" published j
in New York. At one lime she was I
the manager of the co-operative |
bookstore of New York State Col- j
lege at Albany.
