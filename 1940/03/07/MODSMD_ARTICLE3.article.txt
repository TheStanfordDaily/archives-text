# New Rulings For Hospital Aid Students
## Regulations Eliminate Necessity of Visitor Permits from Deans 
### 
New regulations governing stu
dent visitors to student patients in
the Palo Alto Hospital were an
nounced yesterday by Dr. C. E.
Shepard, Director of the Men's
Health Service.
Most notable change in the rules
was in that governing men students
visiting women patients and vice
versa. Formerly the visitor in this
case had to get a special permit from
the Dean of Men or the Dean of
Women; the new rules make this un
necessary.
GET PERMITS AT DESK
In place of the former custom of
getting visiting permits from one of
the Deans, these permits will now
be gotten from the hospital infor
mation clerk in exchange for the
visitor's student body card. An op
posite exchange will take place
when the visitor leaves.
Other rules include a recommen
dation for handling of violations by
Men's and Women's Councils, and
regulation of packages and notes
brought to patients by visitors.
