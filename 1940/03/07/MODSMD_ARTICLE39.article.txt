A PLUG FOR Intramural bas
ketball is in order—in fact overdue.
So far about the only persons who've
been taking in these lively matches
have been club or house members.
That's all right except, other Farm
men and women ought to come
around Monday and Wednesday
nights of next week and see the
scrappy ball these teams play in
semi-final and final rounds.

AN INJUSTICE WAS done our
Indian basketballers—especially Ken
Davidson—this week. No one was
more surprised than was this cam
pus when Southern Division coaches'
selections for the all-conference
team to find nary an Indian on the
"all" five.
That Davidson was not selected
wsa nut only an injustice to Ken
ny but to the team. It was Stan
ford which defeated the Trojans
at their very best . . . and then
went on to win the second place
in the division. It was our Indian
ball team which game after game
put on a sterling brand of bail,
making the most of the fast
breaks Coach Everett Dean taught
them.
And it was Kenny who slipped in
ahead of Dale Sears of Troy to win
third place in the individual scoring,
and who was a great factor in keep
ing the Cards rolling smoothly.

COACH DEAN HAD a few words
to say about the season and the
team yesterday:
Several people have asked me
about next year's team. Basket
ball is too uncertain to forecast
results. Injuries and sickness hurt
the team tiiis year and these evils
are always iust around the corner
every season for every team.
"However, with most of our team
intact and if a few of the better
freshman players come through,
then we will have a good team.
The 1940 Stanford basketball team
was composed ol a high class group
of boys who put a lot of effort in
their season. It has been a real
pleasure to work with and asso
ciate with these boys."

MORE ABOUT OUR Indian team
can be told by Chuck Smith, Slants'
adjective-slinging scribe:
"This year's outfit was a team
in the true sense of the word. It
depended more upon Dean's plan
ned offense and the competitive
drive of the players . . . It's strong
est weapon was the quick break
which scored time and again easy
buckets and always kept its riv
als backpedaling.
"A lot more ball games would
have been won il the Indians had
learned one rule of ball possession.
They were prone to forget that when
they had possession, the other team
wasn't any sort of a threat. And
they often hurried their plays and
shots . . . rather than wait for bet
ter opportunities.
"Still the strength of the team
cannot he told fairly by the sea
sonal record. When Fordy An
derson was sick, the Cards drop
ped five games in a row. three to
conference members and two to
practice teams . . . Only once—
and that was the second Trojan
game—were they actually beaten."
