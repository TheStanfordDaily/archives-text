### 
WINTER HAVEN. March 6 (UP).
â€”Carl Hubbeil admits his screwball
was the cause ol all the trouble he
has had with his left arm the past
few seasons, but the 37-year-old
southpaw figures he will be good
enough to win ll> or 18 games for
tin- New York Giants this year.
Hub says his arm feels better this
spring thi(i) it has in years,'and he's
taking cart- not to try throwing hard
too early in. the season.
