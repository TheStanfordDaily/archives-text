# Sick-Bed Etiquette

wtaTHEN we send students to the hospital,
VV we send them there because they are
sick."
And those words of Dr. Charles Shepard,
director of the Men's Health Service, are as good
a reason as any for the newly announced
"Code" or set of rules for conduct around the
interned members of the student body. But
these new rules are not a whimsy of either the
Administration or the Health Service. Dr. Shep
ard and other faculty members, as well as
student leaders, have been working on the
problem for weeks. Their findings and deci
sions will undoubtedly prove their worth in
short order.
Chief sore point of the old scheme was a
laxity in the number of visitors a patient could
have in a day. Before the revision, fifteen or
twenty of the brothers could barge in on con
valescing Frathouse Freddie, smoke cigarettes
and play games all afternoon with no control
over their antics. When they departed, they
left Freddie behind with a relapse in a room
so full of smoke that one doctor swears he had
to cut his way to a sighing man's bedside.
Naturally, normal convalescing patients,
those with broken legs and the like, like to talk
and see their friends whenever they can. No
one should complain when the medical authori
ties themselves allow four persons each visiting
period, or eight a day, into a sick man's room.
The principal duty of both the doctors and the
Health Services is to get the student patients
back into the everyday college swing as soon
as possible. Not a soul will be harmed except
a few die-hards who will have to bull session
at home now instead of in the hospital room of
an invalid comrade.
While most of the changes are in the form of
restrictions, one important concession has been
granted. That is the outmoded and prudish rule
which formerly reguired students desiring to
see patients of the opposite sex to obtain per
mits from the appropriate Dean's office. So long
as the individual doctors put no restrictions on
visitation privileges, men and women may now
see one another as often as is otherwise allowed.
Which might be one way of saying that time
still marches on.
