# Prepping for Life
## 
### 
ARE you interested in Engineering, Law,
Medicine? Or don't you know what you
are going to do? Maybe you came to college
because it was the thing to do. Or again maybe
you came to discover something worth while
that you would like to do. This latter point is
where the Men's Vocational Guidance Com
mittee hopes that it may be of some help to
you.
All this quarter it has sponsored "vocational
guidance talks" by prominent men, who are
leaders in their respective fields and who have
something worth while to say. Such men as
Dean Chandler of the School of Medicine and
Dean Jackson of the Business School have
spoken. Last night Dean Kirkwood of the Law
School presented the concluding subject of the
quarter.
These talks are something tangible which the
undecided student can understand and put his
mind to work on. He may use the information
which he gains to find out what he is destined
for —what he wants to prepare for.
The committee has done an excellent job
both in sponsoring such talks and in picking
such experienced and talented men to discuss
the various possibilities. The committee has
done something more than just meet and argue.
It has presented a definite program and carried
it out well.
Looking to the future with an eye toward con
tinuing the fine start, they have prepared an
intelligent questionnaire which they hope will
be filled out and returned by all men students.
Let's fill out the questionnaire and look to
planning our futures.—G. H.
