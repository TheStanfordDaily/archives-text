## BANKERS' WAR 
### 
'THE EDITOR. SIR:
The sec ret eablegram sent from England by Walter
Mines Page to President Wilson one month before war
was declared in I!M7 gives the cue to our official mo
tive for war: . . The pressure of this approaching
crisis. I am certain, has gone beyond the ability of the
Morgan financial interests or the British and French
(iovernments . . It i-> not improbable that the only
way <>f maintaining our present pre-eminent trade
position and averting a panic is by declaring war on
Germany.
"We could keep on with our trade and increase it.
till the war ends, and after the war Europe would

purchase food utid an enormous supply of materials
with which to re-equip her peace industries. We
should thus reap the profit of an uninterrupted trade
over a number of years, and we should hold their
securities in payment."

r jpHIS cablegram was kept hidden from the American
people until discovered and published by the Sen
ate Munitions Investigations Committee, December
1934.
Yet even the profits did not roll in as Page ex
pected, for there followed the inevitable post-war
depression and the Allies were unable to pay their war
debts. However, the House of Morgan did not lose,
for, according to an A.P. dispatch, Jan. 9, 1935, they
confessed to the Senate investigating committee that
the U. S. government took $29-1,000,000 of British war
debts off the Morgans' hands in 1918.
Upon learning of the Page cablegram, one man
who had lost the flower of his family on the false
slogan. "To save the world from democracy," ex
claimed, "I could only wish that every word of this
cablegram could be written in blood and read by
every American."
