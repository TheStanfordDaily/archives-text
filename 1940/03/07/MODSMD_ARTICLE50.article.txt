'THE EDITOR, SIR:
The guy who wrote that smooth-band letter is
one of the weirdest individualists this side of a hermit.
He objects to the nation's outstanding popular musi
cians (like Flptcher Henderson, Benny Goodman, and
Duke Ellington) and is all for "Chuck Foster." Why
doesn't he hold a Graveyard Prom in the Chapel—
featuring Guy Deadpan and his Royal Organists?
Yours
Not a Rug-Cutter
