FEMALES AND POLITICS
LEA NOR ROOSEVELT has been a favorite target
of Republican gagmen. They have likened "My
Day" to a grown-up Girl Scout's diary. And they have
invented a prayer for the President which begins,
"Dear God, please keep Eleanor quiet . . ."
But despite Republican laughter, Mrs. Roosevelt
has been no small source of worry to Mr. John D. M.
Hamilton and his defeat-harried campaigners. Thi'y
know that no matter what popular guff appears in
"My Day," Franklin's wife Eleanor is a powerful po
litical asset to the Democratic machine.
Mrs. Roosevelt may supply a good after-dinner
joke every time she writes a column or proclaims her
interest "in the Girl Scout movement," but every time
she makes a public move she insures more votes for
her husband. And democratic votes are not funny at
all in the eyes of the Republican chiefs. So it has al
ways been a sort of bitter mirth that Mrs. Roosevelt
has supplied the President's political enemies.
% >t« # s*
I>ROOF that Republicans have envied the amazingly
popular appeal of America's most active woman,
is the recent dawning on the political horizon of an
other vote-getting female, Martha Taft. Governor Taft
is a colorless personality with a voice more lethal
than ten grains of morphine. (Rumor has it that when
he speaks at a political banquet the guests use no
doze instead of sugar in their coffee.)
But Martha Taft—ah, there's a Taft with public
appeal! She campaigned for her husband when he
ran for Governor of Ohio and won more votes by
discussing homesy-folksy problems at women's clubs
than many a pamphlet did with tiring political prom
ises. And now those self-same Republican humorists
who thought Mrs. Roosevelt was so "funny" are prim
ing Martha Taft for a real publicity campaign. They
say that Mrs. Taft will steer clear of womanly banali
ties and stick to political issues. But attempts to
keep a woman away from a woman's forte is a dubious
endeavor.
And there is one thing about Mrs. Roosevelt that
Martha will have difficulty in duplicating. That is
one of Eleanor's undeniable long suits—courage. When
she frankly and openly upbraided the Daughters of
the American Revolution for their insulting and big
oted treatment of Marian Anderson, Mrs. Roosevelt
earned the respect of millions of voters —including
liberal Republicans.
The only thing that worries me is the possibility
of a banality contest between Martha and "My Day."
The women of the French Revolution used to write
secret political messages in their knitting. But it would
be terrible to think that America's females might re
duce their political activity to a knitting-bee plane,
discussing teas and girl scouting.

FEMALES AND POLITICS
LEA NOR ROOSEVELT has been a favorite target
of Republican gagmen. They have likened "My
Day" to a grown-up Girl Scout's diary. And they have
invented a prayer for the President which begins,
"Dear God, please keep Eleanor quiet . . ."
But despite Republican laughter, Mrs. Roosevelt
has been no small source of worry to Mr. John D. M.
Hamilton and his defeat-harried campaigners. Thi'y
know that no matter what popular guff appears in
"My Day," Franklin's wife Eleanor is a powerful po
litical asset to the Democratic machine.
Mrs. Roosevelt may supply a good after-dinner
joke every time she writes a column or proclaims her
interest "in the Girl Scout movement," but every time
she makes a public move she insures more votes for
her husband. And democratic votes are not funny at
all in the eyes of the Republican chiefs. So it has al
ways been a sort of bitter mirth that Mrs. Roosevelt
has supplied the President's political enemies.
% >t« # s*
I>ROOF that Republicans have envied the amazingly
popular appeal of America's most active woman,
is the recent dawning on the political horizon of an
other vote-getting female, Martha Taft. Governor Taft
is a colorless personality with a voice more lethal
than ten grains of morphine. (Rumor has it that when
he speaks at a political banquet the guests use no
doze instead of sugar in their coffee.)
But Martha Taft—ah, there's a Taft with public
appeal! She campaigned for her husband when he
ran for Governor of Ohio and won more votes by
discussing homesy-folksy problems at women's clubs
than many a pamphlet did with tiring political prom
ises. And now those self-same Republican humorists
who thought Mrs. Roosevelt was so "funny" are prim
ing Martha Taft for a real publicity campaign. They
say that Mrs. Taft will steer clear of womanly banali
ties and stick to political issues. But attempts to
keep a woman away from a woman's forte is a dubious
endeavor.
And there is one thing about Mrs. Roosevelt that
Martha will have difficulty in duplicating. That is
one of Eleanor's undeniable long suits—courage. When
she frankly and openly upbraided the Daughters of
the American Revolution for their insulting and big
oted treatment of Marian Anderson, Mrs. Roosevelt
earned the respect of millions of voters —including
liberal Republicans.
The only thing that worries me is the possibility
of a banality contest between Martha and "My Day."
The women of the French Revolution used to write
secret political messages in their knitting. But it would
be terrible to think that America's females might re
duce their political activity to a knitting-bee plane,
discussing teas and girl scouting.
