### DOUC JAQUES 
IMCIIES AM) RAGS
Now I don't, know precisely how it was on the
Farm 30 or 40 years ago. I suppose a guy could say
Hello to his friends without feeling conscious of being
a part of tradition, but I know they did have a spirit
of their time which built an atmosphere at Stanford
for them. And I doubt whether they were as clothes
conscious as our own Back to the Farm movement
would make you believe. The boys and girls probably
just bought what everyone else was buying at Phelps,
as they do today, without thinking a great, deal about it.
This current reviving of tradition is really rather
amusing. The spirit of a place is implicitly in the
place itself, and cannot be forced. We have our own
spirit today as much as the people of past generations.
That was proved even by today's vigilante spokes
man, who was explaining for The Daily that persons
not playing Back to the Farm games tomorrow would
bo thrown into jail or, he added, "They may buy a
ticket to the canoe raffle or 500 Dance."
The spirit of the students at Stanford today is, more
than anything else, tied in with the idea of making
money.
Did you ever sit in on a meeting of a class discussing
the plans for a dance? What do they talk about most
of the time. How the dance will be a lot of fun?
Sure.

TURKISH DELIGHT
I see by The Daily that the director of the Ram's
Head one-acts says that "Saturday Night'' is "absolutely
typical of sorority life."
That strikes me as rather a surprising thing for a
Phi Kap to Joe saying as if he knew all about it from
first hand.

PRIZE Itll)
They tell me the guy who can think of the most
original form of transportation expressing "Back to
the Farm" spirit will get. a prize.
I suggest a railroad. The railroads brought Stan
ford here to begin with.

SERI()I'S PURPOSE
After the show they took their dates out to an
ofT-campus house where one of the guys lived. The
nirls were signed out, the radio was playing softly,
and outside it was a beautiful early spring night.
Everything was good.
Yes. for five minutes. Until one of the guvs said,
"Oh, I think I II go home and translate my Spanish.
What do you want to do. Joe""
