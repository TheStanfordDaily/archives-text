# German Businessman Escapes Nazis, Becomes Farm Janitor
## 
### JEFF LITTLEBOY 
From a $400-a-month job in a
German textile company to the posi
tion of a mop-jockey in a Stanford
dormâ€”that's the saga of one of the
members of the Farm's janitorial
staff.
Mr. X, who must be nameless for
fear of Nazi reprisals on his rela
tives in Germany, is a fugitive from
a German concentration camp. He
left Germany in May of 1939, "le
gally, with a visa," as he expressed
it, and arrived in Los Angeles via
the Panama Canal. His departure
was hastened by the death of his
brother in a Nazi prison camp.
CHICKEN RANCH JOB
In Los Angeles he was met by
his cousin, with whom he stayed un
til he got a job on a Petaluma
chicken ranch. From there, he got
his job as janitor at Stanford. His
main object is to learn the language,
he said.
"There wasn't much opportunity
to learn it on the chicken ranch,"
he said.
Mr. X was born in the environs
of Breslau, Silesia, eastern Ger
many. He went through the lower
grades and thence to high school,
or a "gymnasium." as they are
called in Germany. Then, after a
course in business school, he got a
job in one of Germany's largest
textile plants in Cologne.

| In Jin equivalent of an American
I success story, he gradually rose to
sales manager, after gaining a
! thorough knowledge of all phases of
i the industry.
ERSATZ' DISPLACEMENT
"Then in 1935," he said, taking a
I meditative swipe at the gleaming
j Mies of a Branner shower room,
"they began to have little need for
an expert buyer of raw textile ma
terials, due to the German program
of 'ersatz* or substitute materials."
So after a three-year period of
traveling for his firm over Czecho
slovakia, Belgium, England, and
France, economic and political fac
tors caused him to appeal to his
uncle in Spokane. His uncle sent
him credentials, and the necessary
deposit, and he left for America.
We're still regarded as the land
j of opportunity over there, he says.
