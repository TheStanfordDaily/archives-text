# Olson Recall Action Started
## Racing, Dictagraph Scandals Begin Move 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, March (»
(UP). — California — battleground
of pension plans. "Grapes of
Wrath," and waterfront strikes—
tonight appeared moving toward a
full-dress recall campaign against
Governor Culberl L. Olson, Demo
crat, which may hulk large in a
Presidential year.
The new recall action, by far the
most powerful of several that have
been started, bounded into public
attention from the springboard of
two scandals which legislative com
mittees now are trying to tie to the
Olson administration. They are:
liASES FOR MOVE
1. A dictagraph found in the
hotel room of Assembly Speaker
Gordon Garland and at least indi
rectly traced to Olson's official
family.
2. Charges Olson lieutenants
tried to shake down southern Cali
fornia's fabulously rich horse
racetracks for campaign contribu
tions in return for choice racing
dates.
The recall — which would be the
first in California history—assumed
national importance because Olson
is President Roosevelt's number one
elective official boosting for a third
term.
Olson has repeatedly plumped
for a movement to draft Roose
velt and has even said he would
enter the California primaries him
self as a stalking horse if necessary.
SOMI) FOR I D R.
He and his lieutenant governor,
Ellis E. Patterson, have healed an
old breach for the express purpose
of Throwing a Roosevelt punch into
the Democratic National Conven
tion. They split long ago over pen
sion and oil controversies.
The latest and most potent, recall
is backed by a Southern California
group headed by C. C. C. Tatum and
J. A. Smith of Los Angeles. For the
first time the recall moved into
Northern California. The group won
a major victory when a court ruled
that, its petitions must bear the sanc
tion of the organization. This de
feated an alleged maneuver of Olsor
forces to file recall petitions them
selves before the recall group wa;
ready and soak up the time allotted
lor gathering signatures.
