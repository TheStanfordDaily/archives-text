# HISTORY—1940
## 
### Wilson P. Cannon, '41 
J.JISTORY . . . a narration of
events, an acount of happenings
past and present. And so today, as
Stanford slips into chronological
reverse, History 1940 delves into the
highlights of those vivid memories
of the Farm gone by to find:
That Stanford's color was once
gold. "Pshaw, too much like Cal!"
said a group of "reds" who had de
cided that cardinal would be a much
more "satisfying hue." And so in
1891 at the first Stanford-Cal Big
Game a small but vociferously sat
isfied block of students defiantly
waved cardinal handkerchiefs to the
annoyance of previously blissful
Gold cohorts.
A battle seemed inevitable, but
one inspired cardinal agitator slip
ped a clinking handful to a city
sportswriter. That was enough.
Next day headlines announced,
"Cardinal Defeats Blue and Gold."
Cardinal was in, and Stanford went
of! the Gold standard.

That the first jolly-ups on the
campus were for men students only.
They were sponsored by the Y. M.
C. A., and were planned for "jollity
and fun" . . . hence the name. The
first mixed jolly-up did not occur
until 1910, when the Junior class
made the initial plunge. They
"hoped the affair might help men
and women students become better
acquainted."
That in 1921 the student body
voted 100 per cent for the honor
system, after The Daily editorial
pages sponsored the plan with the
criptic statement that "the aver
age student is not a crook either by
nature or early training."
That the trosh Pajamarino was
inaugurated on a night in the '90's
when nearly 1300 Encinamen march
ed to Mayfield in their nightshirts
to celebrate a Stanford victory over
Cal.

The same year seven juniors were
suspended because of risque lines
in the class play dedicated every
year to "Plug Ugly."
That in 1923 Excom proposed an
amendment that underclassmen be
denied the use of cars on the cam
pus. The same year The Daily
thundered that cars suggest the de
cline of Stanford democracy, the
foundation of a car-owning aristoc
racy, and the creation of a false
social barrier.
That in .1901 the name "Bawl-out"
was originated because it literally
scolded those seniors who were in
reality lower division students, when
the number of units were published
for the first time. In 1933 the little
booklet received official Daily con
demnation when the editorial col
umns called it a "viper in the edu
cational grasses."

That in 1892 the Farm had its first
intramural field day. Any kind of
event was included in which some
competitor thought he excelled. One
athlete became the campus hero be
cause he soared over 5 feet, one-half
inch, in the high jump.
That in the early '90's the football
men had their own brand of "S"
which no other sport could copy.
And that in a Stanford-Cal game in
that period both teams appeared in
uniform, warmed up . . . then dis
covered that neither team had
brought a football.
That Stanford—yesteryear or to
day—is our University.
The first recognized Allied air
raid on German territory occurred
four months after the beginning of
the first world war.
