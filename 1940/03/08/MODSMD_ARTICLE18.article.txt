# The
						FUND DRIVE.
## Our Alumni Contributing. Seniors Are Not Doing Well. Mr. Swafford Prods Class. Graduates Offer Their Mite. 
### 
After a fortnight's concerted drive,
the fourth annual Stanford Fund
appeal will wind up its most suc
cessful year Saturday noon, with
unprecedented returns from alumni
solicitations surpassing all expecta
tions, and the senior class drive lag
ging considerably.
Co-chairman Stan Swaflord of the
senior drive yesterday urged all
callers to complete solicitations and
turn in results to the A.S.S.U. office
as soon as possible, while David Ja
cobson, Fund assistant director, an
nounced that the off-campus solici
tations will have doubled last year's
figures by both the number of con
tributors and monetary totals, when
all returns are in.
Support Urged
In connection with the senior Fund
and Alumni Association membership
drive Swafford stated last night, "At
present, looking at the slow returns,
it does not appear as if the class of
1940 is responding to the Fund and
Alumni Association appeals to the
extent we had anticipated after ob
serving the success of last year's
drive.
"We sincerely hope to see returns
coming in today and Saturday
morning that will show that our
senior class can demonstrate its ap
preciation for the benefits of Stan
ford University." Deadline is Sat
urday noon.
Drive Extended
He also announced that, since re
ports from the off-campus seniors are
coming in slowly, this part of the
drive has been extended until next
F>iday, under the leadership of Bill
Hamilton.
Mr. Jacobson stated that actual
contributions have been made by
170 Palo Alto alumni, amounting to
$1,641, and that approximately 150
who have signified their intention
have not yet consummated their
gifts. Last year there were 132
donors.
Double Last Year
"By the time all results are com
puted we estimate we will have
doubled last year's figures by both
tfhe number of contributors and
monetary totals," he said. "Figures
are incomplete because 15 couples
have not yet reported.
"We appreciate the fine work done
by Chairman Bob Moulton and the
Council of 160 callers and sub-chair
men. This has been an extremely
fine job," he added.
