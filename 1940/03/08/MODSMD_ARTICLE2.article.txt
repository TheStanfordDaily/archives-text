# FARM ACTORS.
## Ramshead One-act Plays. Chills, Thrills, Laughs, Tears. 'Saturday Night' Is Best. Will Please Local Audience. 
### 
A subtle combination of mad hu
/nor, realistic comedy, and stark
tragedy makes Ram's Head's pro
gram of one - act plays a well
rounded evening of dramatic enter
tainment. Seen in dress rehearsal
last night, "We Shall Not Sleep,"
"Saturday Night," and "Meet Mr.
Smith" promise to be liked by Stan
ford audiences.
Ted Hatlen's impressionistic "We
Shall Not Sleep." an episodic drama
of youth and war, achieves a sus
tained mood of futility and irony.
Technical difficulties encountered in
scene changes (five of them) are
somewhat alleviated by the use of
background music during the shifts.
'Saturday Night' Best
Best of the three is "Saturday
Night," a true-to-life story of so
rority life, despite the anomaly it
presents in showing four of the sis
ters sitting home dateless on Satur
day night. Barbara Thrasher, who
stepped into the part of Paulie, one
of the principals, only last nght, de
serves praise fcr adroit handling of
her part. The illness of Barbara
Harris, originally cast in the role,
necessitated a last-minute summons
to Miss Thrasher.
Comedy Unexciting
"Meet Mr. Smith" by Bud Cady
combines a hint of comedy with
several well-timed belly laughs, in
an almost plotless domestic sketch.
Charles Bulotti, Dana Winters, and
Dan Holtom turn in their usual good
performances as erratic characters
which Farm audiences have come to
expect li;om these Gaieties veterans.
On the whole, the plays are, if not
brilliant, at least good entertainment.
Sets well designed as to detail and
general effect add much. Expert and
painstaking direction by Dan Holtom
is responsible for the successful pro
duction of the plays.
