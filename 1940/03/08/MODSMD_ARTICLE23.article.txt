# ENVOY IN PARIS.
## Welles Calls on Dictator A 						Big Discussion of Peace The 						Premier's War Aims. 
### 
I'A'MS, March 7 (UP). —Premier
Kdouard Duludicr today outlined to
Stunner Welles, President Roose- j
envoy, a five-point Allied pro- j
I'i.tm calling for the crushing of Hit- J
Jen in regardless of cost.
Welles, who arrived in Paris to- j
day, held unexpectedly long con- I
It icnces v/it both Daladier and
Pr< sident Albert Lebrun. He re- I
ctived from them France's war!
aim:; and the conditions on which |
France will discuss peace with i
Nazi Germany.
Daladier, whose statements were i
« xpt (ted to be repeated Ijy the Brit- ;
i li when Welles arrives in London '
on Sunday, was understood to have !
told the American President's em- \
issary:
1. There can he no peace and
no compromise as as Adolf
Hitler and the present Nazi re
gime are masters of Germany lie
cause the Allies refuse any peace
which would Itc only a lull be
tween storms.
2. The Allies are pledged to ac- j
repi no peace which does not in
volve the liberation of Poland and |
Czechoslovakia.
3. There cannot be peace until all
Europe receives "substantial as well j
as "moral" guarantees for the se- '
curily of peoples and the integrity
of the independence and frontiers
of all nations.
4. France and Britain refuse to set |
up a detailed project for the reor- j
ionization of world economy — in !
which the United States is vitally j
interested and which is one of the j
principal objects of Welles' European |
lour until peace has been achieved
on the war fronts and "Hitlerism j
crushed," after which the Allies will
welcome the collaboration of the j
United States and all neutrals in I
the realization that peace to be last- ;
irig cannot be a victor's peace but !
must be one affecting all nations.
5. There can be no disarmament j
until there is lull reorganization of I
soild peace after victory, where- J
upon France and Britain must re
tain a "margin of security" over
Germany, at least for a time.
It is evident, even before Welles J
talked with Daladier that France !
is no more disposed than Germany j
to reach a compromise peace and |
that both sides are digging in for :
a long war, confident of eventual
victory. Frenchmen talk of the war
lasting four or five or even six I
years and take the prospect calmly.
During the past ten years 10.011
persons have been killed and 89,780
have been injured in pedestrian ac
cidents.
