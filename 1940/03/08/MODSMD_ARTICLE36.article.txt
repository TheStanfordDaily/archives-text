{ men needn't be so particular now
| about smooth shaves and the girls
won't have to use the kind of rouge
that doesn't rub off,
Bccause "cheek to cheek" dancing
has been placed under the ban.
First the faculty frowned on that
popular sport.
And now the thing has been made

"The attention of the women's con
ference has been called to ihe extent
of 'check to cheek' dancing on this
campus," read a letter the women's

"Considerable criticism has been
made by both men and women chap
erons."
Then the letter says the confer
ence stands behind the attitude of
the faculty.
And that is supposed to settle it.
