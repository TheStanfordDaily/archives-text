I stronger odor of plain, honest-to- |
J goodness cigarettes, issuing through!
; keyholes and from under door sills]
jin the women's dormitory, Roble
| hall, at Stanford, must cease, ac- 1
: cording to Miss Harriet Bradford, j
dean of the women at Stanford uni
versity, who called the co-eds to

and belongings, last term, she saw j
a silver cigarette case lying non- j
I chalantly on the counter next to a]
! one-piece bathing suit and a pair
|of frilly embroidered unmention- j

â€¢ evade the law bv a technicality.
