# LABOR BOARD.
## A
						Rough and Tumble Fight. Over the New Amendments Anti-New Deal Sentiment. 
### 
WASHINGTON, March 7 (UP).—
Friends and foes of the National La
bor Relations Board squared off to
night for a rough and tumble fifcht
after a sharply divided special House
committee offered 21 sweeping Wag
ner Act amendments, including re
placement of the present NLRB.
The amendments were introduced
by Committee Chairman Howard
Smith, anti-New Deal Virginia Dem
ocrat, and two Republicans—Repre
sentatives Charles A. Halleck. In
diana, and Harry N. Routzohn, Ohio
—three-man majority of the com
mittee which spent six months in
vestigating the Labor Board and op
erations of the Wagner Act.
Initial congressional reaction was
mixed, but it was apparent that Pres
ident Roosevelt supporters will
fight the recommendations vigor
ously. Substantiating this was the
refusal of the two New Deal mem
bers of the committee—Representa
tives Arthur D. Healey, D., Mass.,
and Abe Mutdock, D., Utah—to go
along with the majority.
They declared that the proposed
changes would "eviscerate the act
and deprive labor of guarantees
which are the fruits of many years
of struggle and hardship.''
The amendments were offered
along with analytical statements by
the majority and minority and were
immediately referred to the House
Labor Committee whose chairman,
Representative Mary T. Norton, D.,
N.J., promptly predicted the House
would defeat them.
She called her committee lo meet
next Wednesday for preliminary
consideration of the changes but
said she did not believe the House
should take final action until after
Smith's committee makes its final re
port. Today's recommendations were
in the nature of an interim report.
