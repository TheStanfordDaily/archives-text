# PROPER ATTIRE.
## Hashers Participate in It. They Smoke Their Pipes. 
### 
"Order, please."
The hungry student in the Union
Cellar looks up, ready to ask for a
ham on rye, but instead of the usu
ally well-groomed hasher, he sees
one with hair messed, smoking a
corn-cob pipe, wearing a tie but
lacking a shirt. Between the short
apron and stockingless feet his hairy
legs are revealed.
Yes, the Cellar hashers had joined
the "back to the Farm" movement.
Between the serving of entrees and
dessert Wednesday noon, conspiring
hashers decided to defy all regula
tions and go "Rough."
At noon yesterday all hashers on
duty, and those coming on, slipped
off their shirts and socks and
marched out en masse. The smoking
of pipes was soon halted, however,
as the entire Cellar was engulfed in
the smoke screen.
