# RACQUETEERS.
## We Play Against Berkeley. Mumps Remove Mr. Brock. Conference Play in View. 
### 
Stanford's tennis team will be
without the services of Captain Dave
Brock when it meets the Berkeley
Tennis Club on the varsity courts at
2 o'clock tomorrow afternoon.
With the visitors defending cham
pions in the Bay Region Interclub
League, the Indians would have
their hands full with Brock in the
lineup, and his play is bound to be
missed. Brock is out with a case of
the mumps.
Kovacs Not Expected
Contrary to reports received on
Wednesday, Frank Kovacs will prob
ably not appear; but the number one
singles match will lose none of its
appeal with the veteran Gene Smith
lacing Larry Dee. The pair met in
the* finals ol the Del Monte tourna
ment last spring, and Smith eked out
a victory in the deciding set.
Jim Wade, the transfer from Pasa
dena J.C. who has jumped into sec
ond spot on the Card list, will be
matched against Bud Chandler, like
Smith a comparative oldster in ten
nis circles. Chandler was national
itilei collegiate doubles champion,
playing lor Cal more than ten vears
back.
Troy Matches Mar. 23
Tomorrow's match is Stanford's
last warm-up affair before the Coast
Conference fireworks start booming
with the Trojan match here on
March 23. The Indians travel to Los
Angeles lor four other encounters
during the spring vacation.
Practice matches with the West
Side T.C. and the Los Angeles T.C.
will give the Cards an opportunity to
get in top form for a return engage
ment with S.C. and the first of two
matches with U.C.L.A.
