however, are taking advantage ol
the special student rates at Sun Val
ley. This is just twice the number

Bill Janss and Bud McDufiie, the

Snow Fall Great
A report from Sun Valley states
that the total snow on the valley
floor is 23 inches deep, and has
reached a total of 66 inches on Baldy

in the Ram, Sun Valley night spot,
for all Stanford students who will
be there during spring vacation.
