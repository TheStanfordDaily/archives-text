# The 						NEW COACH.
## An Enthusiastic Reception. Mr. Clark Shaughnessy Talks. 1,400 Roisterous Students. Football Said 'Educational'. 
### Gerald H. Mayer, '41 
Fourteen hundred Stanlord stu
dents trooped into Memorial Hall
yesterday morning to meet Clark
Shaughnessy. They came away en
thusiastic supporters of the man who
will be the Farm's football coach for
the next five years.
"They say I'm Irish, hot-headed,
and sentimental," Coach Shaugh-
I nessy told the assembly, "and per
haps they are right. I may say
something sharp to you football
players out there on the practice
field, but it won't mean a thing."
"Sometimes," he added with a
warm smile.
Definite Opinions
Stanford's new mentor, who will
■ succeed Claude E. Thornhill, had
| definite opinions concerning the
dropping of football by the Univer
sity of Chicago, where he coached
before accepting the local offer.
Although he did not mention the
I name of Dr. Robert Maynard Hutch
| ins, president of the University of
Chicago, who has long advocated less
stress on athletics in the educational
field, Shaughnessy declared that he
sincerely believed that athletics in
general—and football in particular—
was a necessary adjunct, to a well
rounded collegiate education.
"Some of the bright minds at Chi
cago decided that football has no
place in the academic field," said
Stanford's new Director of Football,
"but I think they are wrong.
Courage Advocated
"I have a theory that the jails are
filled with young men who refused
to take the hard way to get ahead.
It, doesn't take courage to hit a man
over the head. But it does take
courage to face your problems,
j study them, and work out your own
| solution the honest way.
"I think a football field is one of
I the finest places for teaching a
j young man discipline, co-operation,
I and courage.
"I suppose you would all like to
win some games," he addressed the
audience, and smiled at the answer
ing roar.
Win Some Games
"Well, zo would I," and it was the
audience's turn to smile.
"I don't mind telling you I got. a
stiff neck looking at the scoreboard
last season," he continued.
"But as much as I want to win,
the welfare of my players comes
first. I want all you football players
to consider me as your best friend,
and if you ever have any troubles I
want you to come to me first."
Shaughnessy leaves for Southern
California this afternoon for a series
of talks to alumni groups, but is ex
' pected to return in a week to pick
a home.
Head Yell Leader Gordy Nicoll led
i three yells for "Coach Clark" to
! round out the assembly.

"But as much as I want to win,
the welfare of my players comes
first. I want all you football players
to consider me as your best friend,
and if you ever have any troubles I
want you to come to me first."

Head Yell Leader Gordy Nicoll led
i three yells for "Coach Clark" to
! round out the assembly.
Fourteen hundred Stanlord stu
dents trooped into Memorial Hall
yesterday morning to meet Clark
Shaughnessy. They came away en
thusiastic supporters of the man who
will be the Farm's football coach for
the next five years.
"They say I'm Irish, hot-headed,
and sentimental," Coach Shaugh-
I nessy told the assembly, "and per
haps they are right. I may say
something sharp to you football
players out there on the practice
field, but it won't mean a thing."
"Sometimes," he added with a
warm smile.
Definite Opinions
Stanford's new mentor, who will
■ succeed Claude E. Thornhill, had
| definite opinions concerning the
dropping of football by the Univer
sity of Chicago, where he coached
before accepting the local offer.
Although he did not mention the
I name of Dr. Robert Maynard Hutch
| ins, president of the University of
Chicago, who has long advocated less
stress on athletics in the educational
field, Shaughnessy declared that he
sincerely believed that athletics in
general—and football in particular—
was a necessary adjunct, to a well
rounded collegiate education.
"Some of the bright minds at Chi
cago decided that football has no
place in the academic field," said
Stanford's new Director of Football,
"but I think they are wrong.
Courage Advocated
"I have a theory that the jails are
filled with young men who refused
to take the hard way to get ahead.
It, doesn't take courage to hit a man
over the head. But it does take
courage to face your problems,
j study them, and work out your own
| solution the honest way.
"I think a football field is one of
I the finest places for teaching a
j young man discipline, co-operation,
I and courage.
"I suppose you would all like to
win some games," he addressed the
audience, and smiled at the answer
ing roar.
Win Some Games
"Well, zo would I," and it was the
audience's turn to smile.
"I don't mind telling you I got. a
stiff neck looking at the scoreboard
last season," he continued.
