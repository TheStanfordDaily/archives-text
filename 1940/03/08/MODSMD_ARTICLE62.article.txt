CLARK SHAUGHNESSY—every
story seems to star* out with Clark
Shaughnessy—made two tremendous
hits yesterday, and they were made
off the two most important groups—
the groups which will be watching
him about as closely as anyone for
the next five years (if not longer).
No. 1 group was Stanford's own
students, who jammed the theater
to get a first-hand look at the gen
tleman, scholar, and coach who will
direct the Farm's football destinies.
A home run was scored there right
away.
The big test was to score with No.
2 group, the press—those Bay .sports
writers who've been writing all
those g</)d, bad. and indifferent
things about him since Jan. 11 last,
when he accepted Stanford's propo
sition.

ABOUT 50 GUESTS of the B.A.C.
met in the S.F. Press Club yester
day noon to quiz and then analyzq
Clark Shaughnessy. Needless to say
Clark showed l he gentlemen of the
press that he has the intellect, in
tegrity, and personality to put his
job as football coach across.
Rather than express too many
opinions, I would rather let Slants'
readers in on what went on in that
two-hour session. So here goes: a
running account of the questions
and answers:
=.« *
WHAT WILL BE his principal
purpose? It will be his interest to
take care of Stanford and Stanford
football players first, last, and al
ways. No player will be sent into a
game with an injury from which may
result permanent injury.
Everyone was interested in who
will be Clark s assistants. But that
will be decided from a long list of
men at the next board meeting,
March 14. We know already, how- !

fever, that Jim Lawson was recom
| end coach.

HOW HE FELT about running up
j big scores was asked. "I ought to
! know how it felt to have big scores
j run up against my team." However,
] it's something that can't be helped
: when third-stringers get in there and
! want to show the home folks what
they can do.

We ve been reading all along that
i Shaughnessy doesn'i believe much
;in a system. He tries to fix up a
j set of assignments and select the
j style of game which fits the team.
; And if Clark has his way, it'll be an
j open game which his teams will plav
j "It's more interesting and the boys
j like it better. I'd much rather out
| maneuver the defense and get them
out of position."

i Asked about Norm Standlee, the
; bone-crushing 220-pound fullback.
I he said, "We're figuring out what to
do about a good fullback." Later
about Frankie Albert: "A fine little
j player; I hope he grows, though."
He knew a lot of players' numbers:
Standlee's 22. Jim Verdieck's No. 3,
j and a "5" and a "3" whom this writer
i can't place right now without a score
card.
! Clark wishes the rules weren't
, changed so often "so we can catch
!up with them." He would suggest,
however, the forward pass be thrown
| from any place behind the line. Fear
of copying the pros keeps the simon
i pures from changing this rule, he
! believes.

SCOUTING IS ESSENTIAL. Clark
jsaid. However, he doesn't believe
j you can get as much out of scouting
las you can from pictures. But pic
i lures are banned and if anyone ever
| asks him to see some pictures "he
; took at some game," he'll "absolutely
) refuse to see them."
When he was signed as head
I coach, Clark immediately asked for
all pictures of the Indian games the
| past two seasons. "I watched only
one man in every game straight
through so you can figure how many
| times I had to go over each picture."
About diagrams in newspapers,
"they don't reveal a thing. No, I
don't mind."

THEY ASKED HIM about funda
mentals and whether he would stress
them. "Strategy is a grand thing
but they have to be executed. How
ever, the same is true il' you can
execute them but have no plays.
You can't neglect one at the expense
of the other."
Well, that's about all for the space
we have. Believe me. however, Stan
ford has a real coach.
