# Our CHAMPIONS.
## Rugby Men to Do Battle. California—The Bitter Rival. Two Crowns at Stake. 
### Patterson Nowell, '41 
Two championships—in both the
Northern California Rugby Union
and the California Intercollegiate
! Conference—will be decided tomor
j row when the Cardinal hooters tan
gle with the rugbymen from Cal.
The varsity game will be played
in the California Memorial Stadium
starting at 2:30 o'clock in the after-
noon, and will be followed by a game
between the B teams of both schools
at 4 o'clock.
The Indians are undefeated in the
Rugby Union, while Cal has lost one
game to the Olympic Club. Thus the
Cards are assured of a tie, even if
they lose tomorrow. However, in
the Intercollegiate Conference, Cal
leads with a victory over S. C., whom
the Cards tied in their conference
game. Staniord must win tomorrow
to come out on top in this league.
