# BIG BALL GAME.
## Stanford Baseball Game. Will We Defeat the Gaels? Furious Duel on Mound. 
### 
Stanford baseball fans will he
treated to probably the best bin I
game of the year tomorrow when
Quentin "Cootie" Thompson and St.
Mary's Emmet O Neill hook up in
what should be a red-hot mound
duel.
The Cards will be out to avenge
the 8-4 pasting Earl Sheeley's slug
gers gave Mr. Purkitt in Seals Sta
dium Wednesday night. Game iime
will he 2:30 o'clock, li will be ihe
last time the Farm nine will play
until alter finals, and the last home
game until next quarter.
Thompson and O'Neill rate as the
two top (lingers in coast collegiate
circles. Cootie led the California In
tercollegiate Baseball Association
last spring in the earned run de
partment. The Gael twirler led the
league in strike-outs and also had
the highest percentage of games won
and lost.
Southern Trip
After the two weeks' lapse lor
finals, Coach Harry Wolter will herd
his crew down to Los Angeles to
meet Southern California and U.C.-
L.A. The Troy nine will be played
March 25 and 20, and the Bruins will
furnish the opposition March 21)
and 30.
Their hitting evidently hampered
somewhat by the lights, the Cards
were no match for the owl-eyed
Gaels. Claude Purkitt, working his
first league game of the year on the
mound, had almost perfect control,
issuing only one free ticket to first,
but couldn't throttle the hard-hitting
Moragans.
From Glen Sinnot's second-inning
circuit blow to the clinching three
run rally in the eighth, base hits
rained off the Gael bats.
Frank Maderas, Sheeley's surprise
pitching nominee, kept seven Stan
ford blows well scattered and fanned
11 Cards.
Positions Uncertain
That Wolter isn't decided yet as
to who will work in the right field
post was demonstrated when Frank
Plyl and Jim Verdieck split time
at the position Wednesday. Elton
Boone rammed out his first hit in a
league game, a sharp single through
the infield.
