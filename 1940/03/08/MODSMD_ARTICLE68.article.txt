# PUGILISTS LOSE.
## However, Mr. Rice Wins. Cal Victorious in Fisticuffs. 
### 
Cleaning up in the last of a four
year series of fights, Jack Rice ham
mered out a two-round K.T.O. over
Jules Droubday of Cal last night in
Encina Gymnasium before about 400
fans.
Cal won the team decision by a
score of 5M> to 3' 2.
The 145-pound fight between the
two team captains was easily the
best of an otherwise slow card. Rice
came out slowly and coolly went to
work on his man. He staggered
Droubday several times in the first
and second rounds with hard left
hooks to the head.
Cut Eye Decisive
One of these opened a cut on the
Cal scrapper's left eye, and he wasn't
allowed to come out for the third.
This gave Rice his fourth victory
over Droubday, against one defeat
and one draw.
In the 155-pound class Tom Mac-
Michael pounded Cal's Benny Mitch
ell unmercifully with blasting rights
to the chin to earn a clean-cut deci
sion. Mitchell, a southpaw, was com
pletely outclassed; but showed an
amazing ability to absorb punches.
Doug Grant, Stanford 165-pounder,
picked up an unpopular draw against
Ty Barre. Grant forced the fight all
the way, but apparently lost the nod

I when Barre landed some hard
' punches late in the third round.
In the light-heavyweight final, In
j dian Don Grant lost the decision to
| Ray Greenwood in a slow fight.
| Little damage was done by either
; fighter. Bruce Berg dropped the de
cision in the 127-pound class to Bear
i Don Flaherty.
Three Forfeits
The program was marred by three
forfeitsâ€”two by Stanford in the 120-
I and 135-pound divisions, and one by
j Cal in the heavyweight class. Jack
I Downey acted as referee and called
j the decisions.
Al Kittell and Ken Edwards gave
an exhibition on the parallel bars.
Cold figures by a highway research
board show that automobile drivers
between 19 and 21 years of age kill
220 persons annually, per each 100,-
j 000 drivers; yet this group makes
the best records in driving tests.
