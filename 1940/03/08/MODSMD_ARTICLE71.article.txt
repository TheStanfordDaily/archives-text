# Dear Ma
## 
### 
YESTERDAY you wrote me and gave me the
holy devil for not writing any news to you
in four or five weeks.
Well, I guess you know by now that
ford is a very screwball school. We can go for
weeks and weeks without a sign of life. Then
of a sudden, somebody appoints a committee
to revive this or that, the committee appoints
sub-committees, who in turn get some ambitious
sophomores to do all the work (because the
sophomores are ambitious), somebody writes
something in The Daily or gives away a canoe,
and we suddenly go wild with an enthusiasm
that belies our otherwise egotistical existence.
And that is why I finally found some news to
write to you. The committees and their political
tools have done an exceptionally good job. The
old Farm is going to raise a wild brand of hell
this week-end, and I thought I'd better get this
missive out of the way before the party started.
The general idea is this: Remember the old
traditions and that swell spirit Uncle Gus said
they used to have when he was here? And I
guess he wasn't a big shot either, unless that
sergeant-at-arms job in his tong was more im
portant than it is now. Well, that old spirit and
most of those traditions have died a horrible,
horrible death. Sophomores, when they speak
to freshmen at all, just bow humbly, mutter,
"How's your work?" and go on their cussedly
independent way. Nobody wants to fight v/ith
anybody, play with anybody, or talk to any
body.
Aw, you know what I mean—self-satisfied,
kinda superior. Anyway, this Back to the Farm
celebration (that's the news, Ma) is supposed to
raise the kids from their dead-end complexes
and bring back some of the swell times Uncle
Gus always raves about. I'm the kind of a fellow
who hates to have alumni and others rave about
the times "that was," but darned if I don't think
maybe we did miss the good old days. Even
now some of the fellows are griped as heck
because they have to walk two blocks tomor
row.
Oh, yes, the other news is about Clark
Shaughnessy, that forgotten man of big-time
football whom I mentioned to you before. He
arrived today and I heard him twice, once be
fore the student body and later at a Press Club
lunch in San Francisco. Gosh, Ma, even Uncle
Gus would have been tongue-tied in his boots,
but Clark, or Shag, or Shawnee (Indians, get it?)
or Mr. Shaughnessy, made the most gracious
and convincing appearance for a new coach
that I have ever seen. The students went wild
as they well should have, and Shag, Shawnee,
Mr. Shaughnessy could have had those news
hounds begging for mercy if he were forced
to do it.
He said men were getting soft and lazy. I, like
2,500 other kids, thought he was talking to me
personally, so I rushed down to the gym and
worked out for an hour to get back in his good
graces.
Maybe it was lucky for this new master that
Stanford's Back to the Farm movement had just
started because they cheered and applauded
him for almost ten minutes. Do you suppose
maybe this fine and conscientious man is
ushering a new era onto the Farm? Of course,
it would be nice to have Stanford playing win
ning sports again, but we have so many other
things that no one ever gets hepped up about.
My gosh, things get so dead sometimes that
Beltramo's tables have an inch of dust on them.
And that is dead!
So we are all concentrating now that the spark
set off by old Shag (I feel like I know him now)
and this Back to the Farm thing is going to be
the turning point for another really outstanding
chapter in Stanford's history. We've got some
thing here, Ma, that we want to keep and build
up so when we get a batch of kids they can
listen to the guff that we remember, like the
alumni now do. Once we regain our lost
ground, no one will ever stop us again.
Oh, by the way, dear Momma, if you will
loan me five dollars I know where I can get two
to one on next year's Big Game. And am I
gonna grab it!

Oh, yes, the other news is about Clark
Shaughnessy, that forgotten man of big-time
football whom I mentioned to you before. He
arrived today and I heard him twice, once be
fore the student body and later at a Press Club
lunch in San Francisco. Gosh, Ma, even Uncle
Gus would have been tongue-tied in his boots,
but Clark, or Shag, or Shawnee (Indians, get it?)
or Mr. Shaughnessy, made the most gracious
and convincing appearance for a new coach
that I have ever seen. The students went wild
as they well should have, and Shag, Shawnee,
Mr. Shaughnessy could have had those news
hounds begging for mercy if he were forced
to do it.
He said men were getting soft and lazy. I, like
2,500 other kids, thought he was talking to me
personally, so I rushed down to the gym and
worked out for an hour to get back in his good
graces.
Maybe it was lucky for this new master that
Stanford's Back to the Farm movement had just
started because they cheered and applauded
him for almost ten minutes. Do you suppose
maybe this fine and conscientious man is
ushering a new era onto the Farm? Of course,
it would be nice to have Stanford playing win
ning sports again, but we have so many other
things that no one ever gets hepped up about.
My gosh, things get so dead sometimes that
Beltramo's tables have an inch of dust on them.
And that is dead!
So we are all concentrating now that the spark
set off by old Shag (I feel like I know him now)
and this Back to the Farm thing is going to be
the turning point for another really outstanding
chapter in Stanford's history. We've got some
thing here, Ma, that we want to keep and build
up so when we get a batch of kids they can
listen to the guff that we remember, like the
alumni now do. Once we regain our lost
ground, no one will ever stop us again.
Oh, by the way, dear Momma, if you will
loan me five dollars I know where I can get two
to one on next year's Big Game. And am I
gonna grab it!

YESTERDAY you wrote me and gave me the
holy devil for not writing any news to you
in four or five weeks.
Well, I guess you know by now that
ford is a very screwball school. We can go for
weeks and weeks without a sign of life. Then
of a sudden, somebody appoints a committee
to revive this or that, the committee appoints
sub-committees, who in turn get some ambitious
sophomores to do all the work (because the
sophomores are ambitious), somebody writes
something in The Daily or gives away a canoe,
and we suddenly go wild with an enthusiasm
that belies our otherwise egotistical existence.
And that is why I finally found some news to
write to you. The committees and their political
tools have done an exceptionally good job. The
old Farm is going to raise a wild brand of hell
this week-end, and I thought I'd better get this
missive out of the way before the party started.
The general idea is this: Remember the old
traditions and that swell spirit Uncle Gus said
they used to have when he was here? And I
guess he wasn't a big shot either, unless that
sergeant-at-arms job in his tong was more im
portant than it is now. Well, that old spirit and
most of those traditions have died a horrible,
horrible death. Sophomores, when they speak
to freshmen at all, just bow humbly, mutter,
"How's your work?" and go on their cussedly
independent way. Nobody wants to fight v/ith
anybody, play with anybody, or talk to any
body.
Aw, you know what I mean—self-satisfied,
kinda superior. Anyway, this Back to the Farm
celebration (that's the news, Ma) is supposed to
raise the kids from their dead-end complexes
and bring back some of the swell times Uncle
Gus always raves about. I'm the kind of a fellow
who hates to have alumni and others rave about
the times "that was," but darned if I don't think
maybe we did miss the good old days. Even
now some of the fellows are griped as heck
because they have to walk two blocks tomor
row.

to one on next year's Big Game. And am I
gonna grab it!

YESTERDAY you wrote me and gave me the
holy devil for not writing any news to you
in four or five weeks.
Well, I guess you know by now that
ford is a very screwball school. We can go for
weeks and weeks without a sign of life. Then
of a sudden, somebody appoints a committee
to revive this or that, the committee appoints
sub-committees, who in turn get some ambitious
sophomores to do all the work (because the
sophomores are ambitious), somebody writes
something in The Daily or gives away a canoe,
and we suddenly go wild with an enthusiasm
that belies our otherwise egotistical existence.
And that is why I finally found some news to
write to you. The committees and their political
tools have done an exceptionally good job. The
old Farm is going to raise a wild brand of hell
this week-end, and I thought I'd better get this
missive out of the way before the party started.
The general idea is this: Remember the old
traditions and that swell spirit Uncle Gus said
they used to have when he was here? And I
guess he wasn't a big shot either, unless that
sergeant-at-arms job in his tong was more im
portant than it is now. Well, that old spirit and
most of those traditions have died a horrible,
horrible death. Sophomores, when they speak
to freshmen at all, just bow humbly, mutter,
"How's your work?" and go on their cussedly
independent way. Nobody wants to fight v/ith
anybody, play with anybody, or talk to any
body.
Aw, you know what I mean—self-satisfied,
kinda superior. Anyway, this Back to the Farm
celebration (that's the news, Ma) is supposed to
raise the kids from their dead-end complexes
and bring back some of the swell times Uncle
Gus always raves about. I'm the kind of a fellow
who hates to have alumni and others rave about
the times "that was," but darned if I don't think
maybe we did miss the good old days. Even
now some of the fellows are griped as heck
because they have to walk two blocks tomor
row.
Oh, yes, the other news is about Clark
Shaughnessy, that forgotten man of big-time
football whom I mentioned to you before. He
arrived today and I heard him twice, once be
fore the student body and later at a Press Club
lunch in San Francisco. Gosh, Ma, even Uncle
Gus would have been tongue-tied in his boots,
but Clark, or Shag, or Shawnee (Indians, get it?)
or Mr. Shaughnessy, made the most gracious
and convincing appearance for a new coach
that I have ever seen. The students went wild
as they well should have, and Shag, Shawnee,
Mr. Shaughnessy could have had those news
hounds begging for mercy if he were forced
to do it.
He said men were getting soft and lazy. I, like
2,500 other kids, thought he was talking to me
personally, so I rushed down to the gym and
worked out for an hour to get back in his good
graces.
Maybe it was lucky for this new master that
Stanford's Back to the Farm movement had just
started because they cheered and applauded
him for almost ten minutes. Do you suppose
maybe this fine and conscientious man is
ushering a new era onto the Farm? Of course,
it would be nice to have Stanford playing win
ning sports again, but we have so many other
things that no one ever gets hepped up about.
My gosh, things get so dead sometimes that
Beltramo's tables have an inch of dust on them.
And that is dead!
So we are all concentrating now that the spark
set off by old Shag (I feel like I know him now)
and this Back to the Farm thing is going to be
the turning point for another really outstanding
chapter in Stanford's history. We've got some
thing here, Ma, that we want to keep and build
up so when we get a batch of kids they can
listen to the guff that we remember, like the
alumni now do. Once we regain our lost
ground, no one will ever stop us again.
Oh, by the way, dear Momma, if you will
loan me five dollars I know where I can get two
to one on next year's Big Game. And am I
gonna grab it!
