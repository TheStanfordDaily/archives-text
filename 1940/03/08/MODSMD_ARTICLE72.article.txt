SLOWED TO A WALK

EDITOR, SIR:
Please, Marco Thorne, let me send my deepest
regrets to you. Had I known you were a cripple, and
unable to walk into Paly in 30 minutes, I surely would
have surrendered my pride and given you a lift.
Rosalie Ann Shafter cried on my shoulder though, for
45 minutes. She is sure you have Nagrussey's Disease;
thus explaining your disability.
With a tear or two,
"40 Living in Paly"

DONKEY PARADE

HPHE EDITOR, SIR:
In view of the difficulty the committee in charge
of the antics for the week seems to be having in slo
ganizing some of the unwilling students into ap
proved action I humblv submit the following as a
slogan of some possible benefit:
THIS IS "BACK TO THE FARM WEEK"
BUT DON'T BE A MULE;
MAKE AN ASS OF YOURSELF

RUMIILE SEAT ONE-STEP

HPHE EDITOR, SIR:
Three cheers for Stompy Joe. Give me a swing
anytime. Of course, like anything else, a steady diet
of swing is no good.
And, as far as jitterbugs are concerned, what's
wrong with them, Smooth? You'll find those who
"jitter" don't go to dances to "sit in a car all eve
ning," decorate a bar, or have an excuse to drape
themselves on their partner; they go to "dance!" (be
lieve it or not). What's more, they dance every dance.
They're the best dancers on the floor, too, if you'll
bother to notice. (However, I wouldn't give two cents
for a jitterbug who couldn't dance super-swell to
sweet music when the time came.)
I'm afraid these "grey-beards" (with all apologies
to you Smooth) would "jitter" too—if they knew how.
