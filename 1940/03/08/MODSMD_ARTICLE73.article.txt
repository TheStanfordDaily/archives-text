lIIS MAJESTY THE BOX OFFICE

'J 1 HE "Lampoon," Harvard's humor magazine, has
entered the movie-awards field. They selected
the ten worst pictures of 1939. And it seems to me they
exercised remarkably good taste. Pictures like "Broad
way Melody of 1939," starring that homeliest of tap
dancers, Eleanor Powell, were on the Lampoon's list.
But Jimmy Fiddler, one of the Hollywood gossip
columnists, thinks he has mortally wounded the Har
vard claim to intellectual ability by pointing out that
most of the Lampoon's "ten worst pictures" were box
otlice successes.
There is room to wonder whether Jimmy Fidler
lias made a criticism of popular taste or the Harvard
Lampoon.
The fact that a picture is popular does not. neces
sarily prove that it is a stinker—although "Broadway
Melody's" success might convince one that popularity
is a fairly accurate negative test. But box office ap
peal, on the other hand, surely does not prove that
a movie is not a stinker.
It would be to bad to think that the money-making
ability of Bobby Breen and Jane Withers proves that
those two cuties are artists. In fact, it is too bad to
think that Bobby Breen and Jane Withers are making
money at all.
* * * *
the sad truth is that all sorts of cinematic
garbage is gobbled up by the people who pay.
And movie producers are not in the business to im
prove the public taste; they make movies to reap a
handsome profit from the public taste.
It is perhaps asking too much, then, to expect
'Hollywood's business men to produce good movies
when bad cheap ones make money. But surely it is
not askintr too much to expect Jimmy Fidler to find
a better reason for criticizing the ten-worst-pictures
selection than box-office success.
Louis Brown, one of America's more discriminating
authors, once explained why it is that incidental mu
sic in a movie is seldom remembered. "The sense of
sight," he said, "is much more impressive than the
sense of sound. And when the sense of sight is sup
plemented by the sense of smell, the combination is
unbeatable."
Yes, it must be admitted that most movies success
fully combine visual and nasal effects.
And Barnum was right. The people like it.

'J 1 HE "Lampoon," Harvard's humor magazine, has
entered the movie-awards field. They selected
the ten worst pictures of 1939. And it seems to me they
exercised remarkably good taste. Pictures like "Broad
way Melody of 1939," starring that homeliest of tap
dancers, Eleanor Powell, were on the Lampoon's list.
But Jimmy Fiddler, one of the Hollywood gossip
columnists, thinks he has mortally wounded the Har
vard claim to intellectual ability by pointing out that
most of the Lampoon's "ten worst pictures" were box
otlice successes.
There is room to wonder whether Jimmy Fidler
lias made a criticism of popular taste or the Harvard
Lampoon.
The fact that a picture is popular does not. neces
sarily prove that it is a stinker—although "Broadway
Melody's" success might convince one that popularity
is a fairly accurate negative test. But box office ap
peal, on the other hand, surely does not prove that
a movie is not a stinker.
It would be to bad to think that the money-making
ability of Bobby Breen and Jane Withers proves that
those two cuties are artists. In fact, it is too bad to
think that Bobby Breen and Jane Withers are making
money at all.
* * * *
the sad truth is that all sorts of cinematic
garbage is gobbled up by the people who pay.
And movie producers are not in the business to im
prove the public taste; they make movies to reap a
handsome profit from the public taste.
It is perhaps asking too much, then, to expect
'Hollywood's business men to produce good movies
when bad cheap ones make money. But surely it is
not askintr too much to expect Jimmy Fidler to find
a better reason for criticizing the ten-worst-pictures
selection than box-office success.
Louis Brown, one of America's more discriminating
authors, once explained why it is that incidental mu
sic in a movie is seldom remembered. "The sense of
sight," he said, "is much more impressive than the
sense of sound. And when the sense of sight is sup
plemented by the sense of smell, the combination is
unbeatable."
Yes, it must be admitted that most movies success
fully combine visual and nasal effects.
And Barnum was right. The people like it.
