WATCH IT

When the guy who wrote the feature yesterday
on the German refugee who works as a janitor here
on the Farm first tried to find out about this man,
he went to the head janitor.
"Who," he asked, "is that Gtflman janitor around
here?"
"Oh, we've got a couple of those radicals. We've
got to put a slop to it. One of them was goose-step
ping around Toyon the other day."

THE WOMEN

They say that men at all ages are dying off much
faster than women. Stanford women, in this man
made paradise of theirs, should take particular note
of this.

GREY SKIES

You might know it. As soon as they (whoever it is)
found out about Boathouse Day (wait until next spring
quarter when Boathouse Day will become a bi
weekly affair, the way things are going) the wind
came up and the clouds blew over. I predict un
reasonable weather by tomorrow.
However, I believe this predicted unpleasant weather
will be a perfectly legitimate conspiracy. The heav
ens are doing all they can to save the Junior Water
Carnival, which Stanford's high-pressure organizers
arc desperately trying to kill.
Lake water events week after week do lose just a
little of their zest, you know. They're not like beer in
the afternoon.
Yes, someday these Boathouse days are going to be
really overdone, and watch out. for the rain. Wait
until the lake hits Roble.

REVELATION

This is a revelation, yes, but it started as quite the
opposite.
It came from watching the Stanford girls walk
around the campus yesterday in their Back-to-the-
Farm clothes, black cotton stockings and all:
I know now why no one wrote sex novels 50 years
ago.

TIGHT

I hear that the Pi Phis will all be dressed alike to
day. I suppose that means they will all be wearing
sweaters of the same color.
