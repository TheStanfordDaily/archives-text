### 
"The Grapes of Wrath," opening
tomorrow at the Stanford.
Whether or not you think Stein
beck's book about the plight of the \
migrant workers, as depicttd in his ;
saga of the Joad family, was accu
rate, you still cannot deny that it
was a fascinating story. This, of
course, is, if you were able to look
at the book objectively, something
a number of Californians were un- <
able to do.
The movie version may also be
classed as a darn good yarn. For
cinematic reasons, Steinbeck's propa
gandistic musings have been cut, but
the story of the Joads is there in
tact, and it speaks for itself.
Scenarist Nunnally Johnson and
Director John Ford were faced with
the delicate problem of getting the
picture past the Hays office. That
the two succeeded in this, and still
preserved the essential feeling of
the brutally frank talk and action i
of the Oklahoma share-croppers, is
tribute enough to the intelligence of
the adaptation.
Ford has put over his points by
sheer understatement. He gives you
plenty of time to look at the Joads; j
takes it easy on the near-melodra- I
ma tic things that happened to them; ,
and lets you draw your own con
clusions.
Superb Photography
Magnificent photography using de
liberately harsh cffects and shadows !
highlighting the hungry, staring eyes
of the Okies, does much to drive
home the tragedy of the homeless
people. The only background music
used is "Red River Valley" played on
an accordion and banjo. R's sur
prising how this contributes to the
mood. It's nice to hear the truck
rattling down the dusty highway;
the croaking frogs in the willows;
the whistle of the wind as it lifts the
dust and swirls it around the de
serted Oklahoma homes.
The picture has no real stars,
though Henry Fonda is ostensibly
the star. The nondescript actors
who play role after role, without any
fanfare, have taken over this picture,
and there isn't a bad performance
in it.

John Qualen as Muley, sitting in
a deserted house, telling of his evic
tion in a flat, dead voice; O. Z.
Whithead flirting with the Okie dam
sels; Eddie Quillen, dreaming of be
ing a radio expert; Doris Bowden's
tired, hopeless, whining Roscsham;
Charles Grapewin's dirty, querulous
Grandpa; Jane Darwell's granite
portrayal of Ma Joad, fighting to
hold the family together; Fonda's
quiet, hard Tom.
You can quibble about how any
group of uneducated Okies could be
capable of such high-minded prin
ciples, but once you accept them,
you must admit the picture's worth.
