### WILSON CANNON 
pMGHTING weather in Europe was
good last week.
With the Russo - Scandinavian
question apparently settled by the
fall of Finland, Spring was heralded
into the remaining arenas of war by
the coming of—not wee robins—but
huge fleets of bombing planes, re
newed activity in the sea lanes, and
increased tension in the Maginot-
Siegfried tangent that loomed near
the bursting point.
In what may be termed the first
real Allied outburst since the first
day of World War II last Sep
tember. London engaged in an
aerial game of tit-for-tat with
Berlin when a fleet of British
bombers laid a ten-hour barrage
of explosives on the Nazi air base
at the Sylt sandspit near Den
mark.
In grim retaliation against a
week-earlier Berlin bombing party
held at Scapa Flow off northern
most Scotland, the British air force
braved barking anti-aircraft guns
to cause considerable damage to the
German base, key for possible air
attacks on the British Isles.
But American observers saw a
deeper significance to the attempted
leveling of the Sylt position. They
termed the attack a means to the
end of opening the way for raids on
Kiel and Swinemunde—Adolf's prize
submarine nests —and both on a
dotted line from Britain, through
Sylt, to the Baltic.
* ♦ *
p'URTHER Allied operations were
spiced by the beginning of Brit
ish submarine action in the Baltic,
apparently aimed at plugging the
hole in the blockade occasioned by
the German use of Norway coastal
waters. Braving Norwegian protests,
England's U-boats sunk three Nazi
ore boats in the shadow of the
Scandinavian country's fjords.
Politeness is becoming difficult to
find in British-Norwegian relations.
United Press reports hinted that
the Downing Street attitude was
caused by the now apparent Al
lied haste to come to grips with
Hitler before he can erect more
military, economic, and diplomatic
barriers around the Reich.
The Allies realize they must open
up a new front somewhere, either
in Scandinavia, the Low Countries,
the Balkans or the Near East. Ship
ping incidents in the Baltic, such as
the Altmark episode, may prove to
be the testing grounds for a new
armed tangent.
The brains in the town-on-the-
Thames had looked to the Finland
crisis as a possible springboard for
concerted action on the part of the
Allies. This opportunity now lost,
they may be tracking down another
in the same area.
Hitler's "come and get us if you
can" attitude was explained by one
correspondent who said that the
Reich is building 'her barriers for
a siege, not for an attack.
* * ♦
J>OSSIBILE opportunity for a new
non-slumbering front in the
Near East reached an impasse last
week when the pro-ally Turkish
government refused to okeh a Brit
ish proposal that the Dardanelles be
opened to Allied war vessels. Rea
son given was the time-hallowed
"we do not wish to give undivided
support" one.
Results for the Allies was that
their 800,000 standing army contin
ued to be merely the southeastern
plug for the blockade of Germany—
not the spearhead of a fiercely
functioning war machine heading for
Berlin.
Vulnerable section of the Hitler
Protective Assn. should be the
Near Eastern region. The axis
still protects his southern frontier,
Russia his eastern borders, the
Westwall his western boundaries,
and the fall of Finland is expected
to protect his posterior.
But Britain is still looking toward
the Baltic, with a weather eye cast
backward toward the Near East, as
the possible bottlenecks through
which the Allied troops may march
into the Reich. Opinion holds that
they will jump—but which way is
not known.

J>OSSIBILE opportunity for a new

Near East reached an impasse last
week when the pro-ally Turkish
government refused to okeh a Brit
ish proposal that the Dardanelles be
opened to Allied war vessels. Rea
son given was the time-hallowed
"we do not wish to give undivided
support" one.
Results for the Allies was that
their 800,000 standing army contin
ued to be merely the southeastern
plug for the blockade of Germany—
not the spearhead of a fiercely
functioning war machine heading for
Berlin.
Vulnerable section of the Hitler
Protective Assn. should be the
Near Eastern region. The axis
still protects his southern frontier,
Russia his eastern borders, the
Westwall his western boundaries,
and the fall of Finland is expected
to protect his posterior.
But Britain is still looking toward
the Baltic, with a weather eye cast
backward toward the Near East, as
the possible bottlenecks through
which the Allied troops may march
into the Reich. Opinion holds that
they will jump—but which way is
not known.
pMGHTING weather in Europe was
good last week.
With the Russo - Scandinavian
question apparently settled by the
fall of Finland, Spring was heralded
into the remaining arenas of war by
the coming of—not wee robins—but
huge fleets of bombing planes, re
newed activity in the sea lanes, and
increased tension in the Maginot-
Siegfried tangent that loomed near
the bursting point.
In what may be termed the first
real Allied outburst since the first
day of World War II last Sep
tember. London engaged in an
aerial game of tit-for-tat with
Berlin when a fleet of British
bombers laid a ten-hour barrage
of explosives on the Nazi air base
at the Sylt sandspit near Den
mark.
In grim retaliation against a
week-earlier Berlin bombing party
held at Scapa Flow off northern
most Scotland, the British air force
braved barking anti-aircraft guns
to cause considerable damage to the
German base, key for possible air
attacks on the British Isles.
But American observers saw a
deeper significance to the attempted
leveling of the Sylt position. They
termed the attack a means to the
end of opening the way for raids on
Kiel and Swinemunde—Adolf's prize
submarine nests —and both on a
dotted line from Britain, through
Sylt, to the Baltic.
