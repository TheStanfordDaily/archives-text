# Tryouts Continue For 'Richard II'
## 
### 
Tryouts for "Richard II," to be
given by the Stanford Players the
first week in May, will continue to
night and tomorrow from 7:30 to 10
o'clock in the evening, according to
Director F. Cowles Strickland.
The tryouts will be a continu
ance of those taken last quarter. Al
though students who have already
tried out do not have to attend this
quarter's sessions, Mr. Strickland
wishes to see all that are still inter
ested for a short time this evening.
All of the women's parts except
one have been filled, but there are
several important masculine parts
open, according to Mr. Strickland.
