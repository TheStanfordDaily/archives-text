# ROBINSON RECALLS OLD FARM DAYS
## 
### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
By LARRY LIVINGSTON

It was a hot. summer afternoon in
July of 1911, and the heavy silcnce
of desertion hung over the red tile
roofs of the Quad. Driving up Palm
Drive from Palo Alto station in an
open carriage, a handsome young
history instructor from Wisconsin
and hi.s wife took their first look at
Stanford.
Edgar Eugene Robinson, today
head of the history department and
chairman of the Committee on Pub
lic Exercises and the Committee on
the Independent Study Plan, still
vividly remembers that afternoon
when he walked into the old Library,
now the Administration Building,
and received a cordial handshake and
a warm welcome from President
David Starr Jordan.
He has been teaching at Stanford
ever since then, with the exception
of one year he spent at Yale and
one at Minnesota. Close to the sur
face of his dignified manner lies an
interest in student activities, per
haps more vital than that of any
other faculty member.
In his brilliant lectures on the his
tory of the American West, deliv
red with oratorical finesse ol the old
school. Professor Robinson makes
continual references to the latest, de
velopments in undergraduate life.
When he first came to Stanford
there were only 1800 students here.
"Everything moved slower then," he
reminisces.
Very few cars were to be seen on
the Farm before the War. Only
horse-and-buggies were allowed on
Palm Drive, and what few automo
biles there were had to enter and
leave the campus by Galvez Street,
which runs past Encina.

"Almost all the students used to
ride the old trolley-cars to Palo Alto
in those days," Professor Robinson
smiles. "The faculty men usually
walked."
He remembers one festive eve
ning when several interurban street
cars were chartered to take the sen
ior class to the Hotel Vendome in
San Jose for their Senior Ball.
LIBE POPULAR
The biggest sudden change in
campus life came when the new
Library was built, according to Pro
lessor Robinson. All at once the
students who thronged the Quad,
site of the old Libe, during the af- |
ternoons and evenings deserted it !
lor the new building.
The event which remains most [
vivid in his mind is that day in the
spring of 1917 when most of the stu
dents had to transfer from their
classes to military drill.
"The expectation of immediate
war made that entire semester hec
tic," Professor Robinson recalls,
"but when it did come, campus life
was completely disrupted. Some stu
dents left for camp, and some stayed
on until Commencement, which was
then held in May."
FARM STUDENTS TRAIN
He tells how the Student Army
Training Corps brought most of the
men back to school for next fall.
They spent about half their time
studying and about half in military
training.
In Professor Robinson's opinion i
the gap between college life and j
life after graduation was far greater
in the old days than it is now. Both
the automobile and an incieased in
terest in outside affairs have brought
the students in far closer contact
with the outside world.
PRAISES HONOR CODE
Pie believes that student self-gov
ernment and the Honor Code are
responsible for a fine sense of re
sponsibility on the part of Stanford
students. "It is comparable to the !
attitude of undergraduates in some '
of the better foreign universities," j
he said.
"The Honor Code has grown up 1
naturally from our own experience, |
just like the United States' Consti- |
tution grew out of the experience of
the founding fathers. It was used in i
a great many of our departments
long before it was officially adopted i
by the Associated Students."
"I have never remained in the |
classroom as long as I have been j
giving examinations here," he con- j
eluded.
And the 29 years of Stanford his
tory that he has witnessed seemed
to parade behind his brown eyesâ€” I
which are focussed sharply and un- ;
derstandingly on the present.
Men office workers have been !
more adversely affected by the in- |
stallation of bookkeeping machines j
than women.
