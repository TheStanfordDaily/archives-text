### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
By LARRY LIVINGSTON

It was a hot. summer afternoon in
July of 1911, and the heavy silcnce
of desertion hung over the red tile
roofs of the Quad. Driving up Palm
Drive from Palo Alto station in an
open carriage, a handsome young
history instructor from Wisconsin
and hi.s wife took their first look at
Stanford.
Edgar Eugene Robinson, today
head of the history department and
chairman of the Committee on Pub
lic Exercises and the Committee on
the Independent Study Plan, still
vividly remembers that afternoon
when he walked into the old Library,
now the Administration Building,
and received a cordial handshake and
a warm welcome from President
David Starr Jordan.
He has been teaching at Stanford
ever since then, with the exception
of one year he spent at Yale and
one at Minnesota. Close to the sur
face of his dignified manner lies an
interest in student activities, per
haps more vital than that of any
other faculty member.
In his brilliant lectures on the his
tory of the American West, deliv
red with oratorical finesse ol the old
school. Professor Robinson makes
continual references to the latest, de
velopments in undergraduate life.
When he first came to Stanford
there were only 1800 students here.
"Everything moved slower then," he
reminisces.
Very few cars were to be seen on
the Farm before the War. Only
horse-and-buggies were allowed on
Palm Drive, and what few automo
biles there were had to enter and
leave the campus by Galvez Street,
which runs past Encina.
