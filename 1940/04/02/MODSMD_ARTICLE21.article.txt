# First Day Registration Figure Reaches 3,870; '3 to 1 Average' Dwindles
## Total Registration Lowest of Year As Many Late-Comers Expected; Women Registrants Show Increase 
### 
Figures released last night by University Registrar J. P. Mitchell show
a total spring quarter registration yesterday of 3,870 students, an increase
of 2T,l over last spring's figures. The number ups the total increase to date
for the 1939-40 session to 594.
The more clever Stanfordites who think up those wisecracks on tlio
3 to 1 ratio will have to twist their tongues a bit this quarter, for oflkial

♦figures combined wth Daily office
mathematics show the ratio to be
exactly 2.201 to 1. This combined
with figures from this year's autumn
and winter quarters shows- a steady
increase in the number of women
registrants.
The total registration is the lowest
for this year, however, lagging 337
behind autumn quarter's all-time
high of 4207, and 96 behind winter
quarter's 3966.
Due to the comparative shortness
<>f the vacation, many late-comers
are expected to register within the
next week. Many students who live
in the East are forfeiting the $2 fine
in ordei to have an extra day home.
Complete registration figures will be
■ released next week.
