# Card Debate Team Downs U. of Texas
## Mellinkoff, Moulton Win First Major Encounter of Tour 
### 
Sherman Mellinkoff and Bob
Moulton were victors in the first
major debate of their eastern for
ensic tour when they were awarded
a two-to-one decision against the
University of Texas at Austin on
March 26. The following evening
the Farm team met Rice Institute
debaters in Houston for a non-de
cision argument.
Both debates were on the ques
tion, "Resolved, that the United
States should maintain a strict mili
tary and economic isolation policy
toward all nations outside the West
ern Hemisphere engaged in armed
international or civil conflict." Stan
ford upheld the negative in the first
debate and the affirmative in the
Rice meet.
MEET SOUTHERN SCHOOLS
Next scheduled stops were Uni
versity of Alabama at Tuscaloosa
and University of Georgia at Athens
on March 29 and 30. The debaters
plan to complete their tour by April
22.
Before Sherman Mellinkoff left
for the East, he stopped long
enough to win the Medaille Joffre
debate in the 46th annual contest
between University of California and
Stanford, held in Berkeley on March
13. His victory broke a 22-22 tie
between the two schools, which
have met 46 times in a series that
began with the Carnot medal and
continued for the Joffre award.
TAKES AFFIRMATIVE
Arguing on the affirmative, Mel
linkoff debated on the specific topic,
"Resolved, that French post-war
aims should be orientated toward
European reorganization rather
than security of France." Milton
Marks, Jr., and Lin Moses were the
other members of the three-man
Farm team.
Two Cal debaters placed second
and third, Philip Verleger and
James Keene, Jr., U.C. student body
president. Third member of the
California squad was Llewellyn
Evans.
