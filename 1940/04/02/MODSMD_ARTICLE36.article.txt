# Book Exchange To Open Under New Sponsors
## Former A.S.U. Store Reorganized; Co-op Group to Take Over 
### 
Recently reorganized, Stanford's
Co-operative Book Exchange us now
open to buy and sell used textbooks
on a non-profit basis. For the first
week of this quarter the book ex- {
change will be open from 8 to 12 !
and from 1 to 4 o'clock every day.
Students are requested to bring in
books that they wish to sell as soon
as possible. There is a special de
mand for Economics 2 texts.
Under the new organiaztion the
j book exchange is operated as a
j Rochedale Co-operative, under the
sponsorship of the Co-operative
j Book Exchange Society. Each mem
| ber of the society pays a 25-cent fee.
| as a stock subscription. These mem
! bers elect a board of directors which
| in turn elects the manager.
Manager Russ Curtis reports that
| the exchange, under the manage-
I ment of the A.S.U. last quarter, col
lected a total of $417.62 and paid out
$375 leaving a balance of $35 which
will be returned in rebates to mem
bers who purchased books from
the exchange.
At present there are 2G persons
working for the book exchange;
none of them receive payment for
their work. Books will be taken on
consignment to be held at the ex
change until they are sold. Al
though the greatest demand for
I texts is at the beginning of the quar
ter, the co-operative will be open
for a few hours every week all
quarter.
