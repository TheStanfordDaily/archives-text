# Indian Nine Will Face Gaels Tonight In City
## Thompson Star In Southland Winning Streak 
### JERRY BRUCKER 
By JERRY BRUCKER

After gaining an even split in J
four panics played in the south- |
land over vacation, Harry Wolter's j
Stanford diamondmen will take
the field tonight in Seals Stadium |
against the St. Mary's Phoenix.
Game time is 8 o'clock, with ad- j
mission free to Stanford students, j
Quentin "Cootie" Thompson was
the hero of the southern campaign,
opening it by pitching a 3-1 win
over U.S.C. and closing it with a 3-2
decision over the Uclan nine. Be
tween turns on the mound he played
first base and right field, leading
Card batters with a .400 average.
Cootie turned in one of the best
mound jobs of the year in throttling 1
the Bruins, giving up only three hits
and whifling 12. He allowed the
league-leading Trojans only five hits
when he worked against the Barry
men.
TROY WINS SECOND
Claude Purkitt started the second
S.C. game and pitched shutout ball
for three innings. Going into the
last of the fourth the Cards were
ahead, 4-0, but the ball game blew
up in Purkitt's face, and when the
dust had cleared eight Trojans had
crossed the plate and Russ Smith |
was on the mound. The game ended
8-4. «•*> ffe
The less said about the first U. C. I
L. A. "contest" the better. Every
thing the Reds tried was wrong,
and the Bruins coasted through to
a 7-0 win.
PURKITT TO lIURL
Center fielder Alex Cereghino and
left fielder Norm Juney were the
only other Cards who hit over .300
lor the trip. Both had .375 aver
ages, and both contributed a homel
and a brace of two-base hits to the
attack.
Big Claude Purkitt will be Harry
Wolter's choice to take the mound
tonight against the Sheelymen.
"Purk" is still trying for his first
league victory, having been on the
losing end in two games so far this
season. Frank Maderas will probably
oppose him.
Sid Lewis, first-string backstop,
was out with a split finger during
the vacation games, little Herb At
kinson taking over the job. Hal Cos
tcllo, Harry Parsons, Monty Pfyl,
and Elton Boone will make up the
Card infield tonight.
Either Jim Verdieck, Milt Vuci
nich, or Frank Pfyl will start in
light field, with Cereghino in cen
ter and Juney in left.•
