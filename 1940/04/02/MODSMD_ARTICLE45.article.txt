# Bimelech Favored To Win Derby, 2-1
## 
### 
NEW YORK, April 1 (UP).â€”The
Hag won't fall on the Kentucky
Derby for 33 more days but the
odds on Bimelech to win it jelled
tonight at 2-1 with no guarantee
this newest price won't sink to even
money before the idle hour colt so
much as quits his barn for a tune
up race.
The surprisingly one-sided y-end
is best explained by James J. Car
roll of St. Louis, for years one of
the most prominent commissioners.
Carroll says he has received more
wagers and taken in more money
on Bimelech than on all other 126
Derby eligibles combined, and adds
the money still is rolling in.
Next to Bimelech, the heaviest
turnover has been attracted by C. S.
Howard's Mioland. The Oregon
bred opened at 100-1. Then he won
the $10,000 San Juan Capistrano
Handicap at Santa Anita and the
price was slashed to 50-1. Since then
the western money has been flowing
in and now the prices are 15. 6 and 3.
In this slot he is even with Carrier
Pigeon and Flight Command.
The card game of rummy is said
to have originated in Texas.
