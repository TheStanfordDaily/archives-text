# Shaughnessy Plans Spring Grid Confab
## Hopefuls Will Meet New Head Tomorrow; Assistants to Attend 
### 
With his four aides on hand,
three of them new to the Farm,
Clark Shaughnessy, Stanford's new
head coach, will clear the decks for
spring grid practice with a meeting
of all prospective gridders tomor
row at 3:15 o'clock in Room 214 of
the History Building.
Shaughnessy urged that all men
on the campus who are at all in
terested in going out for football
next fall be present at the meeting,
eveij, if they are competing in some
other sport this quarter that would
make it impossible for them to take
part in spring drills.
DAYS FOR PRACTICE
The main purpose of the meeting
will be to determine which days will
be best for spring drills in view of
conflicts with afternoon labs. The
first actual workout will probably
be held Thursday. The new Indian
mentor plans to work the squad in
track suits for the first few sessions
before contact work starts.
Present plans are to hold three
drills a week during April and to
hold four sessions a week from May
1 until, the 30 days allowed for
spring practice have been used.
LAWSON STILL ASSISTS
The only familiar face on the
coaching staff when drills start will
be that of Jim Lawson, end coach.
Shaughnessy's new assistants are
Marehie Schwartz, former Notre
Dame backfield ace; Phil Bengston,
line coach; and Bernie Masterson.
Masterson, ace quarterback of the
Chicago Bears, will be on hand dur
ing spring practice to teach back
field technique.
