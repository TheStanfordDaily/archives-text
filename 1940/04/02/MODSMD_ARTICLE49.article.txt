# Trackmen 'Shine' In Vacation Tilts
## 
### 
While the rest of the Farm was
| vacationing, Stanford's cinder team
was busy; breaking, tying, and
threatening world records. Their
victories in the Long Beach Relays
and in the California Relays have
established them as a great team
and possible successor to U.S.C.'s
title as the best team in the country.
Down at Long Beach they out
pointed a representative U.S.C. out
fit to walk off with the team victory.
Clyde Jeffrey's world record tying
century dash was the highlight of
the meet.
Next, the Indians smothered Cali
fornia in the newly inaugurated Cal-
Stanford Relays, 36 1-3 to 23 2-3. It
was in these relays that the two
mile team of Jack Moore, Burman
Skiable, Paul Moore, and Mushy
Girard broke the national intercol
legiate record in the time of 7:37.7.
In this meet also, the Card mile re
lay team of Ernie Clark, Charlie
Shaw, Craig Williamson, and Jeffrey
came within two-tenths of the world
record, clicking off their four-quar
ter miles in 3:10.8.
Coach Bill Ellington and his crew
now have their eyes on Olympic
Club's great array of stars which
will invade the Farm this coming
Saturday.
