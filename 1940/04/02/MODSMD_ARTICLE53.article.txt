WE at Stanford who have followed the in
tellectual crucifixion of Bertrand Russell
by the New York Supreme Court and several
dried-up Boards of Education, can once again
be thankful for our Die Luft der Freiheit motto
and spirit.
Mr. Russell, one of the few great philoso
phers of our present era, has been given the
academic bounce because he has written and
advocated certain religious and moral codes
which have often been out of focus with the
"established order."
We at Stanford cannot quite understand why
such a great figure should be tossed aside. We
have been brought up in an atmosphere in
which our professors' private lives, their views
on sex and religion may be their own, so long
as they teach the subjects which they have been
hired to expound. The restrictions placed on
them are certainly no more stringent than those
placed on the individual student. Neither stu
dent nor instructor can ever truthfully say that
he has been ostracized because he was a Catho
lic, an Episcopalian, an atheist, a common gut
ter Communist, or a part-time dipsomaniac.
Our academic freedom here in the great open
minded West is now all the more dear to us.
"American youth," says the American Com
mittee for Democracy and Intellectual Free
dom," must develop its own judgments through
a knowledge of conflicting views, not by living
in the shelter of ignorance and cloistered se
curity. Certainly an institution has an obliga
tion to offer its student body every available
opportunity to examine different views about
the nature and future of society."
Two of Stanford's most eminent professors
are members of the American Committee.
In mathematics and logic, even his fiercest
critics readily admit that the brilliant Mr. Rus
sell is on a pinnacle by himself. Why, then,
should these staid and conservative gentlemen
wish to deprive us of a scholar's superior learn
ing simply because ihat scholar's views on
other subjects are completely foreign to their
own? Russell himself has provided us with the
best defense of educational liberalism:
"The habit of considering a man's religious,
moral, and political opinions before appointing
him to a post or giving him a job is the modern
form of persecution, and it is likely to become
quite as efficient as the Inquisition ever was.
If, in practice, certain opinions lead a man to
starve, it is poor comfort to him to know that
his opinions are not punishable by law."
A course by Russell at Stanford would un
doubtedly draw well over five hundred seri
ously interested students, including at least one
good Baptist.

Mr. Russell, one of the few great philoso
phers of our present era, has been given the
academic bounce because he has written and
advocated certain religious and moral codes
which have often been out of focus with the
"established order."
We at Stanford cannot quite understand why
such a great figure should be tossed aside. We
have been brought up in an atmosphere in
which our professors' private lives, their views
on sex and religion may be their own, so long
as they teach the subjects which they have been
hired to expound. The restrictions placed on
them are certainly no more stringent than those
placed on the individual student. Neither stu
dent nor instructor can ever truthfully say that
he has been ostracized because he was a Catho
lic, an Episcopalian, an atheist, a common gut
ter Communist, or a part-time dipsomaniac.
Our academic freedom here in the great open
minded West is now all the more dear to us.
"American youth," says the American Com
mittee for Democracy and Intellectual Free
dom," must develop its own judgments through
a knowledge of conflicting views, not by living
in the shelter of ignorance and cloistered se
curity. Certainly an institution has an obliga
tion to offer its student body every available
opportunity to examine different views about
the nature and future of society."
Two of Stanford's most eminent professors
are members of the American Committee.
In mathematics and logic, even his fiercest
critics readily admit that the brilliant Mr. Rus
sell is on a pinnacle by himself. Why, then,
should these staid and conservative gentlemen
wish to deprive us of a scholar's superior learn
ing simply because ihat scholar's views on
other subjects are completely foreign to their
own? Russell himself has provided us with the
best defense of educational liberalism:
"The habit of considering a man's religious,
moral, and political opinions before appointing
him to a post or giving him a job is the modern
form of persecution, and it is likely to become
quite as efficient as the Inquisition ever was.
If, in practice, certain opinions lead a man to
starve, it is poor comfort to him to know that
his opinions are not punishable by law."
A course by Russell at Stanford would un
doubtedly draw well over five hundred seri
ously interested students, including at least one
good Baptist.
