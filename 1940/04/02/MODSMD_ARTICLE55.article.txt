# CAMPUS OPINION
## FIFTH AVENUE FRILLS 
### 
r jniE EDITOR, SIR:
I am writing to state my ideas of what Stanford
should be. Before I came here I had the idea that
Stanford was an upperclass school, but on my ar
rival I was sadly disillusioned. The University was
founded by a wealthy man, and I feel that its real
purpose was to afford an education for the sons of
the wealthy. The idea of students coming here and
paying their way either wholly or partially by outside
work is degrading in the reports that go out to the
country at large.
In spite of what the freshman handbook says, each
student should have a car. This would make a better
showing for the campus and would eliminate the hitch
hiker riff-raff which occupies every campus street
corner. I have heard visitors remark that these hitch
hikers give the campus a frowsy appearance.
Why can't we pattern our university after those
in the East. There they have a higher ideal of social
life. No male student would think of appearing in
class in the sloppy clothes that they wear out here.
The students here have become slop in a dish of
gold. Let us restrict the enrollment so that a man
may say that he is a Stanford graduate and experience
a thrill of pride (hat only a few may feel. This is my
opinion and in the opinion of my parents is what
Stanford should signify. I hope that this change may
soon come.
