# SLEEPING BEAUTY
## 
### 
ANGELES is a huge jig-saw puzzle that was
never pieced together very carefully. It has a
hundred disjointed parts, ranging from valley cow
country to the gaudy splendor of Hollywood Boule
vard.
But wildest and showiest of all in Los Angeles is
that champagne-bubble world whose axis is the Movie
Industry. Hollywood is a great big jangling place with
lots of swing and jazz and verve. There is ample money
in Hollywood, but so far the wealth has clouded the
sky with "colossal' things, beyond which one must
look hard for occasional flashes of brilliant art.
In general, Hollywood is the modern gold-rush cen
ter. Like California in its bonanza days, it is untamed,
crude, and high-spirited. For all three of those quali
ties, Hollywood is interesting.
But some of the most boring people in the world
are members of the colony which has side-show attrac
tiveness. They are the average over-paid performers
and writers who are sure that Newton was wrong
about the sun: Hollywood is the center of the universe.

r are vital and intelligent men, of course, and
artistic geniuses. But you can always spot one of the
small-minded boys by his wise-cracks, which are of
gum-chewing caliber. Their horizon is "their public,"
whom they know only as a mass of inferiors who some
how are gifted with the ability to applaud Hollywood's
extravaganzas. But to the realities beyond their arti
ficial show-world, most movie-men are blind.
There is a very clever stage show which has been
running for weeks now at the Hollywood Playhouse
entitled, "Meet the People." The opening number is a
chorus routine about. "Sleeping Beauty." "Shhhh!" the
girls whisper between leg gyrations, "Sleeping Beauty
must not be awakened." And a curtain opens on a
silk-clad lady(?) who blissfully sleeps while all around
her bed run strikers, policemen, robbers, politicians,
and soldiers.
The silk-clad lady is very attractive, and over her
bed is her name: Mademoiselle Hollywood. It's too bad
Prince Charming is only a myth, because if she ever
wakes up, Sleeping Beauty will really dazzle America.
