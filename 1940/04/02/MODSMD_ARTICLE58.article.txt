## VACATION NOTES 
### DOUC JAQUES 
The boys, they toll me, found that on the beaches
of Southern California when you want to pick up a
junior college female, say, tell them you are from
S>Vfm<Â§ord.
By "picking up" I mean simply getting a blind date
in person on the spur of the moment, so to speak.
Most middle-aged women and Stanford girls think the
phrase connotes a cigarette drooping from a guy's lips
and a libidinous leer in his eyes. No, I mean just pick
ing them up.
When you try to pick them up, you can tell them
anything: that they are young and beautiful with the
wind and the rain in their hair, that you have nothing
but time on your hands and that they are much better
holding than time, that you have a whole quart of
beer just over there. It won't do you any good.
The thing to tell them is that you come from Stan
ford. It was quite a surprise finding this out after
being up here so much where Stanford doesn't mean
a thing; when you are lucky, that is.
At Carmel they also ran. Mascara and all.
