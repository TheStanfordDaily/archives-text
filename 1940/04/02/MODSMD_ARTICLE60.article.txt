# WITHOUT REHEARSALS

### 
During finals week last quarter a few of the boys
were having a little poker game over in Toyon, I un
derstand, when they heard a knock on the door.
"Who the hell is it?" One of the guys yelled.
The knock was repeated.
"Well, come in."
They came in: two gentlemen, the presidents of
Stanford and Rochester universities. Dr. Wilbur wanted
to show his colleague what a typical Stanford dormitory
was like.
Yes.
