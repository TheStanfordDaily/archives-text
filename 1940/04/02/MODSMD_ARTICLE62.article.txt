# Crosby, Hope Hit the Spot In 'Singapore'
## 
### 
"Road to Singapore" and "Vigil in
the Night," now playing at the Stan
ford.
The above statement should be
qualified. "Road to Singapore" is
playing at the Stanford. "Vigil in
the Night" is not playing; it's stand
ing soggily on the sidelines feeling
sorry for itself. You might possibly
get a couple of laughs out of the
"Vigil," but you certainly weren't
intended to.
However, the cries of pain about
this unfortunate drama can be post
poned for the nonce, because, de
spite the producer's no doubt well
meant efforts, it is definitely the
second half of this double bill. It's
so second, as a matter of fact, that
we advise careful timing in your at
tendance so that you can miss it
altogether.
GOOD COMBINATION
It's a pleasure to write about "Road
to Singapore." This is the best
Crosby picture in years; and that
nice individual who first thought of
teaming Crosby and Bob Hope is
one of the brighter minds of the
decade. Completely happy-go-lucky,
with lots of laughs, and music, not
quite inspired, but catchy, "Road to
Singapore" is as fine a way to spend
an evening as we've seen in a long
time.
Dorothy Lamour wanders around
in a native costume (no, not a sa
rong) and an accent, adding femi
nine interest and a song or two. The
fact that she can't act is unimportant,
because she's not required to. Jerry
Colonna lets out that voice of his
with the usual effect and his mus
tache and eyes combine with his
brand of crisp insanity, to keep you
happy when Hope and Crosby are
not around.
OTHER PICTURE STINKS
As for "Vigil in the Night," it's
rank. Carole Lombard suffers and
suffers as a nurse who loves her pro
fession forsaking all else. And is
she noble! She never makes a mis
take; but she takes the blame for
everything.
If nursing is like that, then her
little sister, who loathed the pro
fession, had the right idea. But they
couldn't even let the sister (played
excellently by Anne Shirley) main
tain her healthy and quite under
standable attitude. Oh no, she had
to save a dying child's life, catch the
disease, and die herself, gasping out
her new-found love for the profes
sion during the proceedings.
TOO MANY TEARS
Miss Lombard doesn't let out her
raucous laugh once; and, if she man
ages a smile, it's literally through
tears. That a crack comedienne like
Lombard was cast in such a role is
a supreme tribute to the genius of
some mis-casting department. If the
picture had to be made, they might
at least have had the decency to
keep her out of it. She has abso
lutely no business walking wanly
down the foggy streets and through
hospital corridors in nondescript
English clothes or starched uniforms.
Also in there struggling valiantly
against the horrors of plot and lines
is Brian Aherne, who has something
of a reputation as an actor, as we
recall. But the boys and girls have
a hopeless task.â€”Nowell
