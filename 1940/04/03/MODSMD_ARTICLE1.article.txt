### WILSON CANNON 
A FEELING of tension umbrellaed
Number 10 Downing Street in
London last night.
And in Berlin, the nervous goose
steps of the top men on Der Fueh
rers' diplomatic staff rang through
the frescoed halls of the German
Chancellory.
Minds in both war-time capitols
were tuned to the same wave
length—waiting for the same voice.
But here similarity ceased. The key
men in London, and the leaders in
Berlin, were hoping for a vastly
differing message.
Focal point of attention was
Rome, where Benito Mussolini,
final missing link in the great chain
of opposing powers, had hinted
that, perhaps, he was about to
make up his mind.
The hint was dressed in quietly
voiced statement issued by the Ital
ian council of ministers to the ef
fect that from yesterday on, Italy
would be in a state of civil mobiliza
tion throughout the country in the
event of war.
It was the "in the event of war"
phrase that set the war-lords in
London and Berlin wondering.

HPHESE four words mark the
' strongest terminology that the
mouthpieces in Rome, cagiest in a
world of war-time super-diplomats,
have yet used. Statesmen through
Europe took them as a honeyed
threat that Mussolini may finally be
ready for positive action.
Latest strong stand made by Italy
was remembered with mingled feel
ings by members of the rival camps.
The incident, now almost a month
old, occurred when Rome strongly
protested British seizure of Italian
coal ships, en l'oute from German
loading docks to their home ports in
Italy.
England, remembering this, had
a case of the jitters yesterday
when she reasoned that the inci
dent may have delved deeper into
Italian economic needs than re
alized, perhaps remained rankling
in tlie? Italian file of international
memories.
Berlin, recalling the aftermath of
the incident, worried over possible
soothing effects of the smooth diplo
matic touch shown by Britain's for
eign staff in Italy after the Rome
protest. England at the time, ap
parently, had played the "little Miss
Fixit" role to perfection.

DOTH Romeos 111 the European
balcony have good reason to
woo Italy, the present Juliet of na
tions.
For Juliet has a potent mailed fist,
and the question of whether Italy
would make a strong friend or a
portent ious enemy needs no an
swering.
Largest reason for the contro
versy over Italian friendship is the
strategic position of the Italian
peninsula . . . strategic in both a
military and an economic sense.
And to this strategic position, Mus
solini has added the utmost in mili
tary strength in a whirlwind of pre
paredness which has included con
struction of a powerful war ma
chine and the formation of forts
along her Alpine border.
Should Italy pitch her tent in
one of the opposing camps, the
Maginot-Sicgfricd stymie would no
longer exist. Brenner Pass would
prove the handy route around the
lower elbow of the tangent on the
Western Front . . . for either
side. The Po Valley would play
no favorites in the search for a
hattle ground.
And the dark shadow of II Duce's
economic might along the Meditei"-
ranean would prove welcome shade
for either Berlin or London. The
Allies know well that Italian bases
in this area could effectively block
Franco-British munition and com
munication lines to vitally important
colonies in Africa and India.
And Italian scissors on the Adriatic
could cut German life lines through
the Balkans to minerals and Rou
manian oil with similar ease.

But here similarity ceased. The key
men in London, and the leaders in

Focal point of attention was
Rome, where Benito Mussolini,
final missing link in the great chain
of opposing powers, had hinted
that, perhaps, he was about to
make up his mind.
The hint was dressed in quietly
voiced statement issued by the Ital
ian council of ministers to the ef
fect that from yesterday on, Italy
would be in a state of civil mobiliza
tion throughout the country in the
event of war.
It was the "in the event of war"
phrase that set the war-lords in
London and Berlin wondering.

HPHESE four words mark the
' strongest terminology that the
mouthpieces in Rome, cagiest in a
world of war-time super-diplomats,
have yet used. Statesmen through
Europe took them as a honeyed
threat that Mussolini may finally be
ready for positive action.
Latest strong stand made by Italy
was remembered with mingled feel
ings by members of the rival camps.
The incident, now almost a month
old, occurred when Rome strongly
protested British seizure of Italian
coal ships, en l'oute from German
loading docks to their home ports in
Italy.
England, remembering this, had
a case of the jitters yesterday
when she reasoned that the inci
dent may have delved deeper into
Italian economic needs than re
alized, perhaps remained rankling
in tlie? Italian file of international
memories.
Berlin, recalling the aftermath of
the incident, worried over possible
soothing effects of the smooth diplo
matic touch shown by Britain's for
eign staff in Italy after the Rome
protest. England at the time, ap
parently, had played the "little Miss
Fixit" role to perfection.
