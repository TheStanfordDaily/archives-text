# THIRD TERM SCORED Poll Reveals Farm's Political Opinion
## 
### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
Whether President Roosevelt should be elected for a third
term is no problem at all for Stanford students.
They voted 59 per cent against a third term; and 38 per cent
of that majority named Thomas E. Dewey, New York's racket
buster, as their choice for presidential election.
In a survey conducted by The Stanford Daily, 59 per cent of j
the students queried voted "no," 29 per cent "yes," and 12 per j
cent "don't know," to the question, "If President Roosevelt is
nominated, will you vote for him for a third term?"
THIRD TERM HINGES ON EUROPE
A substantal group disapproved a third term, provided Euro
pean conditions become less critical than at present, and that
capable men are named opposing candidates—otherwise Roose
velt would be their choice through necessity. Others strongly
opposed a third term on grounds that "precedent should not be
disregarded," "we've had enough of F.D.R.," and "the country
will go to the dogs if he is in for another four years."
The 59 per cent who disapproved a third term were asked
whom they favored as the next President, and answered as
follows:
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES
Thomas Dewey 38% Cordell Hull 9%
Arthur Vandenberg . 11% John Garner 7%
Herbert Hoover 3% Undecided, but want
Undecided, but want a Democrat 5%
a Republican 27%
(Others listed were Robert Taft and Paul McNutt.)
ROOSEVELT POLLS HIGHEST, BUT . . .
Significant is the fact that Roosevelt received 29 per cent of
the total votes, yet Dewey was named by only 22 per cent of all
those participating. This does not consider, however, the 12 per
cent who were undecided on the third term question, nor the 27
per cent who desired a Republican but did not know whom.
A breakdown of the cross section according to sex indicates
women students condemn a third term more strongly than men.
When the sample was divided according to classes and grads,
no unusual currents of opinion were revealed, except that fresh
men were 99 per cent opposed to a third term.
Results of the third term question, according to class, follow:
Yes No Undec.
Freshman . . . • 1% 99% 0%
Sophomore 39% 61% 0%
Junior 33% 39% 28%
Senior 37% 55% 8%
Graduate 31% 52% 17%
(Any percentage less than . 5 is considered 0.)
These facts were secured through a survey of student opinion
on the campus recently completed by The Daily by means of a
scientifically compiled cross-section of Stanford students. Fac
tors considered were sex, class, affiliation with Row, Hall, or In
dependent (living in private residence or at home). Each classi
fied group was polled in proportion to its total representation
on campus.

a Republican 27%
(Others listed were Robert Taft and Paul McNutt.)
ROOSEVELT POLLS HIGHEST, BUT . . .
Significant is the fact that Roosevelt received 29 per cent of
the total votes, yet Dewey was named by only 22 per cent of all
those participating. This does not consider, however, the 12 per
cent who were undecided on the third term question, nor the 27
per cent who desired a Republican but did not know whom.
A breakdown of the cross section according to sex indicates
women students condemn a third term more strongly than men.
When the sample was divided according to classes and grads,
no unusual currents of opinion were revealed, except that fresh
men were 99 per cent opposed to a third term.
Results of the third term question, according to class, follow:
Yes No Undec.
Freshman . . . • 1% 99% 0%
Sophomore 39% 61% 0%
Junior 33% 39% 28%
Senior 37% 55% 8%
Graduate 31% 52% 17%
(Any percentage less than . 5 is considered 0.)
These facts were secured through a survey of student opinion
on the campus recently completed by The Daily by means of a
scientifically compiled cross-section of Stanford students. Fac
tors considered were sex, class, affiliation with Row, Hall, or In
dependent (living in private residence or at home). Each classi
fied group was polled in proportion to its total representation
on campus.

(Ed. Note: This is the first in a series of reports on a recent
poll of student opinion. Tabulations on other subjects will
follow in early issues.)
Whether President Roosevelt should be elected for a third
term is no problem at all for Stanford students.
They voted 59 per cent against a third term; and 38 per cent
of that majority named Thomas E. Dewey, New York's racket
buster, as their choice for presidential election.
In a survey conducted by The Stanford Daily, 59 per cent of j
the students queried voted "no," 29 per cent "yes," and 12 per j
cent "don't know," to the question, "If President Roosevelt is
nominated, will you vote for him for a third term?"
THIRD TERM HINGES ON EUROPE
A substantal group disapproved a third term, provided Euro
pean conditions become less critical than at present, and that
capable men are named opposing candidates—otherwise Roose
velt would be their choice through necessity. Others strongly
opposed a third term on grounds that "precedent should not be
disregarded," "we've had enough of F.D.R.," and "the country
will go to the dogs if he is in for another four years."
The 59 per cent who disapproved a third term were asked
whom they favored as the next President, and answered as
follows:
REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES
Thomas Dewey 38% Cordell Hull 9%
Arthur Vandenberg . 11% John Garner 7%
