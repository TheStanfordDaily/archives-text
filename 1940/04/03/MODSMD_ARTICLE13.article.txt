# Dewey Leads In Wisconsin Party Primary
## Garner Trails F.D.R. 2 to 1 in Democratic Preferential Contest 
### 
MILWAUKEE, April 2 (UP).—
Thomas E. Dewey, 38-year-old New
York district attorney, led Wiscon
sin's presidential parade in early re
turns from the state's presidential
primaries.
The returns showed President
Roosevelt leading Vice - President
John Nance Garner almost two to
one in the Democratic preferential
primary but their total vote was
trailing the total cast in the Republi
can delegate contest.
Returns from 118 of the state's
3,011 precincts gave for delcgates
at-large:
Garner slate: Callahan 1,384,
Fitzsimmons 1,030, Finnegan 1,015,
Port 1)72: Roosevelt-Farley slate:
Henney 1,212, Rubin 1,328, Wallis
1,2(53, Werner 1,055; Roosevelt
slate: Hammerslcy 1.274, Keller
1,214, McGovern 1,483, and Seyfert
1,039.
The Republican National Conven
tion delegate slate pledged to Thomas
E. Dewey for President led a slate
pledged to U.S. Senator Arthur H.
Vandenberg of Michigan almost two
to one tonight in returns from 101 of
Wisconsin's 3,011 precincts.
The vote for Dewey delegates at
large was 13,236; for Vandenberg's
delegates at large, 7,224.
The Progressives, whose third
party strength was great enough to
swing the national convention del
egate election of either the Re
publican or Democratic party, ap
peared to be indifferent to both in
the early returns. Voting was
sluggish throughout the day and
indications were that not more
than 500,000 votes would be cast.
The contest between Mr. Roosevelt
and Garner was complicated by the
fact two slates of delegates pledged
to Mr. Roosevelt were before the
voters as against one for Garner.
Thus, it was mathematically possible
Mr. Roosevelt could lead Garner in
the voting but still lose the conven
tion delegation to the Vice-President.
Twenty - four delegates will be
chosen for each convention, two from
each of the 10 Congressonal dis
tricts and four from the state at
large. Delegates elected are bound
to their candidates at the conven
tions as long as the candidates ap
pear to have a chance for nomination.

sin's presidential parade in early re
turns from the state's presidential
primaries.
The returns showed President
Roosevelt leading Vice - President
John Nance Garner almost two to
one in the Democratic preferential
primary but their total vote was
trailing the total cast in the Republi
can delegate contest.
Returns from 118 of the state's
3,011 precincts gave for delcgates
at-large:
Garner slate: Callahan 1,384,
Fitzsimmons 1,030, Finnegan 1,015,
Port 1)72: Roosevelt-Farley slate:
Henney 1,212, Rubin 1,328, Wallis
1,2(53, Werner 1,055; Roosevelt
slate: Hammerslcy 1.274, Keller
1,214, McGovern 1,483, and Seyfert
1,039.
The Republican National Conven
tion delegate slate pledged to Thomas
E. Dewey for President led a slate
pledged to U.S. Senator Arthur H.
Vandenberg of Michigan almost two
to one tonight in returns from 101 of
Wisconsin's 3,011 precincts.
The vote for Dewey delegates at
large was 13,236; for Vandenberg's
delegates at large, 7,224.
The Progressives, whose third
party strength was great enough to
swing the national convention del
egate election of either the Re
publican or Democratic party, ap
peared to be indifferent to both in
the early returns. Voting was
sluggish throughout the day and
indications were that not more
than 500,000 votes would be cast.
The contest between Mr. Roosevelt
and Garner was complicated by the
fact two slates of delegates pledged
to Mr. Roosevelt were before the
voters as against one for Garner.
Thus, it was mathematically possible
Mr. Roosevelt could lead Garner in
the voting but still lose the conven
tion delegation to the Vice-President.
Twenty - four delegates will be
chosen for each convention, two from
each of the 10 Congressonal dis
tricts and four from the state at
large. Delegates elected are bound
to their candidates at the conven
tions as long as the candidates ap
pear to have a chance for nomination.
