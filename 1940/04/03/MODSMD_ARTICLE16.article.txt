# Roth Describes Waterfront Labor Set-Up
## 
### 
"This is primarily a pressure game,
and we might as well be realistic
about it," declared Almon E. Roth,
president of the San Francisco Em
ployers' Council, in describing the
waterfront labor conditions for the
Tuesday Evening Series last night.
Mr. Roth remarked that there is
talk of co-operation between em
ployer and employee "all through the
top leadership."
"In other words the unions have
voluntarily established checks," he
explained in connection with the
present tendency among the unions
to require that the employers be
notified before a strike may be called.
STRESSES CONTRACTS
To illustrate the increasing sta
bility of the labor problems in San
Francisco, Mr. Roth quoted the ex
istence of 225 unions and the more
than 300 collective bargaining agree
ments.
"If we could get both parties to live
up to their contracts we'd have this
thing settled because our contracts
are fair," he said, and continued
later, "You get back to good faith in
' the last analysis."
CO-OPERATION NEEDED
Mr. Roth condemned the irrespon
sibility of many of the labor leaders.
He explained that as the unions
achieve their just aims they arc
forced into excessive demands to
justify their continued existence.
As an example of this attitude he
quoted a prominent official as say
ing "You're either going to give me
something for my men or I'm going
to make you trouble because that's
the only way I can hold my union
together."
"I'm not enthusiastic about gov
ernment regulation in this matter,"
Mr. Roth stated. He expressed the
opinion that "enlightened self-in
terest" on the part of the unions'
members when they realize the prac
tical need for co-operation will ac
complish more than government in
tervention could.
