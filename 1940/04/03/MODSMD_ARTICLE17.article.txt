# Seven Students Pass CAA Tests
## 
### 
Helen Ford of Stanford was the
first woman in the West to earn her
Civil Aeronautics Authority civilian
air training certificate when she and
six Stanford men won their pilot's
wings in final tests at the Palo Alto
Airport on March 29. The men were
Fred Breer, Jr., Robert K. Smith,
Frederick Kimball. William Ballhaus,
Robert Rand, and Edward Rust.
Of the seven students, Breer and
Smith completed their course under
their own volition, without any aid
from the C.A.A, Both of them took
the air training program under a
restricted classification as they were
compelled to wear glasses.
Successful applicants will now re
ceive their private pilots' certificates
enabling them to fly for pleasure,
and to carry non-commercial pas
sengers. Each has had 35 hours of
controlled flying in the air.
