### 
NEW YORK. April 2 (UP).â€”Coun
: el for Bertrund Russell, whose ap
pointment to the faculty of the City
College of New York was rescinded
by w Supreme Court ruling because
ol his moral and religious advoca
cies, made a second attempt late
today to reopen the case.
Osmond Fraenkel, Russell's at
torney, filed with Supreme Court
Justice John E. McGvfhan a mo
tion requesting the British philoso
pher and mathematician be made a
party in the suit.
In an earlier action today, McGee
han, whom Russell described as "ob
viously a very ignorant fellow," de- j
ilied a show cause order in which 1
Fraenkel sought to have the case I
reopened to give Russell an oppor- j
1 unity to defend himself and his:
writings against charges of immor
ality. Russell's appointment to the !
faculty was rescinded Saturday by i
McGeehan.
