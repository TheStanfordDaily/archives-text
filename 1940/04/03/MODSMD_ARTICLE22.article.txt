# SOCIALITES AID STRANDED NAZIS
## 
### 

S. F. SOCIALITE VOLUNTEERS distribute books, games, and cards, supplied by the Red Cross, to ISO
stranded members of the crew of the Nazi liner Columbus. The men are interned at Angel Island and
have the run of the entire island. "Ruppert's liuh" (Ruppert's Rest) was built by the sailors and named for
one of their officers.
