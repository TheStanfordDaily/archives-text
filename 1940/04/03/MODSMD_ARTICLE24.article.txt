# Hart, Star Trackman, Out with Appendicitis
## 
### 
Bad luck took another poke at
Jack Weiershauser, freshman track
coach, recently when Vern Hart,
outstanding hurdler and high
jumper, was stricken with appen
dicitis. Hart, who was expected to
garner high-point honors in the
Little Big Meet, is definitely lost for
the season. The frosh meet the Pen
insula All-Stars this Saturday.
