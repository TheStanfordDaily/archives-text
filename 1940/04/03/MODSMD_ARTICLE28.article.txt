Stanford's newly reorganized Co

ness yesterday of over $200, Russ
Curtis, manager, announced today.
The book exchange is open from 8
to 12 o clock and 1 to 4 o'clock every
day in the basement of the Women's
Clubhouse. Students are urged to
bring in used textbooks as soon as
possible. These books will be taken
on consignment to be held at the
co-operative until they are sold.
i here is a demand for Economics
2 texts; Mac Donald's "Labor Prob
lems on the American Scene"; and
Martin and James, "The Republic of
Latin America."
Any student interested in joining
the Co-operative Book Exchange
Society which sponsors the book
exchange, may do so by purchasing
a 25-cent stock subscription.
Such stock entitles the member to
vote for the board of directors, and
to share in rebates made from
profits. The 25-cent payment may
be made in the basement of the
Women's Clubhouse or to any mem
ber of the society.
