bathers, if Ex Committee takes ac
tion on a suggestion considered at
its meeting last night.

NEED $84 EOR DECK
President Ken Cuthbertson said
he will consider the matter with
Student Manager John Cobbs and
Daily Editor Arch Jenkins and re
port to the committee next week.
Expenditure of $84 would be nec
essary to outfit the new sundeck, it
was suggested.
A group of students already have
volunteered, it was reported, to can
vass the campus to raise this amount.
Some of the committeemen intimated
such a plan might be rejected be
cause it would constitute a fund
drive.
Other business ti'ansacted at the
meeting follows:
STUDENT RELIEF: The Commit
tee denied a request for funds made
by the European Student Service
Fund, which is engaged in providing
relief for Far Eastern and Central
European refugee students. The rea
son: Ex Committee's policy of giving
financial aid to no outside groups.

Cuthbertson appointed John Porter
and Sylvia Berry as a committee to
report next week whether or not
Stanford should send delegates to
the convention of the California
Youth Legislature in Los Angeles

He said a week's thought should
be given the matter since there were
indications that Stanford's sending
of delegates might be "twisted into
an endorsement of ther program."
NEW RELAYS: So that Stanford
cindermen who competed in the
first annual Stanford-Cal relays held
last March 23 may have their rec
ords in that meet apply on Block "S"

an endorsement of ther program."

cindermen who competed in the
first annual Stanford-Cal relays held
last March 23 may have their rec
ords in that meet apply on Block "S"
awards, President Cuthbertson ap

NEED $84 EOR DECK
President Ken Cuthbertson said

Student Manager John Cobbs and
Daily Editor Arch Jenkins and re
port to the committee next week.
Expenditure of $84 would be nec
essary to outfit the new sundeck, it
was suggested.
A group of students already have
volunteered, it was reported, to can
vass the campus to raise this amount.
Some of the committeemen intimated
such a plan might be rejected be
cause it would constitute a fund
drive.

by the European Student Service
