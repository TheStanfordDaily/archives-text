While about 3950 students got a
whirl ol some easy life over spring
vacation, about 20 Indian trackmen
were left stranded on the dullest
campus you ever s;>w. They were
propping lor a track meet with
Fresno State which was never held.
They felt their time a bit wasted
also when ol' Sol failed to show up
sc that they could have track meet
ings every morning at the Boat
house.

LP A'l CAL in the first annual
relays (it'll probably be annual be
cause ol its great success both in
drawing in the fans and getting an
idea ol what the Indians and Bears
look like a month before their Big
Meet) a few things can be gleaned
lrom the results for consumption in
this column.
I tig Clyde Jeffrey, the fastest
thing on two feet, fairly hurncd
up the cinders with three races
(all relays). Most everyone came
out to see him heca ise only a week
catlicr he had tied the world's
100-yard dash record of :!).4 sec
ends.
A lot of publicity has been given
to Stanford's two crack relay teams
the mile and two mile. It'll be
only a matter of time before the
Card juggernauts will hold world
marks in these two events. If they
don't do it before, then they'll get
their chance at the Fresno Relays,
May 11. on the fastest track in the
West.

NO ONE HAS saicl a heck of a
lot; about a couple of unsung field
men. Maybe that's because their
work isn't exactly in the spectacular
stage as yet, but it's coming awfully
close.
No. 1 man is Ray Brown, who
threatens to do a mean job of
hroadjuinping this spring. Ray
won the event at Cal at 23:11. Take
a look at the results up and down
the Coast so far and you'll find
that no one has bettered that. The
prospects are that Brown will be
jumping 21 feet regularly this year
but he'll have a hit of competi
tion from Thor Peterson and Jack
Kern.
Walt. McKenzie went down to the
Long Beach Relays and surprised
everyone with a 13:5 vault—his best.
Walt's so modest that he doesn't
oven tell his fraternity brothers
about his achievements, but one of
these days all they'll have to do is
read it in the papers and not wait
lor Walt. Mac also has some stern
competition to keep him moving in
Bob Kenyon and Ed Tomaso (the
man who "missed all six jumps" in
the Cal Relays).
Ol I{ IH'RDLERS have a story to
(<•11 about the relays. It's about Mel
Long, the ace Bear hurdler, who was
getting his picture in the Bay City
papers just about every night before
the meet.
Sid Hayes and Dick Simpson,
our :14.6 and : 1 -1.7 hurdlers, who
can beat Long any time in the
week, decided to have a little fun
at his expense. So they took a
little Brownie camera with no
film and started to take pictures
ol Mel when he was warming up
for the shuttle hurdle event.
They told him that they were tak
ing the pictures for "The Stanford
(Jazette.' It must have upset him
because this writer was able to keep
within hailing distance of him in
the first leg of the race.
To top oIT it all. Long got his
picture in .Monday morning's
Chronicle. And were Sid and Dick
burned!

THIS DEPARTMENT could put
on a sportorial campaign for a new
set of bleachers at Angell Field, but
the chances of the B.A.C.'s getting
around to it aren't very likely. It's
been talked about so much that the
trackmen are a bit disgusted.
They won't get free (raveling
jackets—unless they pay for 'em
—like the football and basketball
teams. If the reason is that the
track team doesn't make any
money, then the B.A.C. should lis
ten to this.
With the trackmen hotter than
blazes and getting all kinds of fa
vorable publicity in the city papers
InM-ause ol the track burnin' sprint
ers and relay men, Angell Field
would be completely sold out every
meet.
Next year it's not going to do 'em
as much good as it would this, be
cause the team will be definitely
weaker with .the graduation this
•lune of most of the point-getters
on Bill Ellington's squad.
