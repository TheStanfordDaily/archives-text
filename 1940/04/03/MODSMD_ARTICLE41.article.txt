# Papoose Nine Hops Sixth Win
## 
### 
Minus their coach but playing with
the spirit that only a winning streak
can call forth, Stanford's freshman
baseball team turned in their sixth
straight win yesterday by trouncing
Albany High 5-3. Hurler Bill Harms
was relieved by Phil Wolf after the
fourth frame but received credit for
his second victory of the season.
Coach Harry Shipkey is now de
voting most of his time to football,
so Art Esslinger, assistant coach, will
handle the revived nine most of the
time from now on.
Losers of their first four tilts to
four of San Francisco's best high
school clubs, the Papooses now seem
to have hit their stride and will go
after their seventh Friday against
San Mateo high school.
Yesterday's battle was practically
iced in the first inning when an
error, a walk, a double-stael by Ray
Hammett and Ted Falasco, and sin
gles by Hammett and Harms netted
three tallies. Captain Clark Graham
drove in the fourth run in the sec
ond round following a pass to
Catcher Oscar Holmes.
Chunker Wolfs blow in the ninth,
plus a walk and another Albany
error ended the scoring for the
frosh in the sixth. Although they
made no errors, the yearlings showed
the effects of over three weeks' idle
ness and there is room for improve
ment before the Cal frosh series
starts a week from Saturday.
