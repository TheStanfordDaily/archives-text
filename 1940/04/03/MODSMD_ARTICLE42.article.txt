# Stanford, O.C. Clash Saturday In Track Meet
## Preston, Humphreys, McCurdy Lead Club Stars into Close Tilt 
### 
Last year the Stanford-Olympic
Club track meet ended in a dead
head, 05':>-(55'/a, which is something
mighty rare iov track, competition. 1
Again this year tht two teams very
closely matched.
The Club will field its usual ar- 1
ray ol ex-college stars and if they I
are all in top condition, they should
be able to take Bill Ellington's out- '
lit; lor they are truly the cream of |
(he Pacific Coast's recent crop of '
cindermen.
MEET TO BE CLOSE
However, the old-timers are often i
not in the best of condition 01* un
derrate (he new blood that is always !
crowding into the spotlight of track
and field. Therefore Saturday's j
encounter will probably be pretty
close and is bound to have plenty of
good performances.
The Cards will undoubtedly take '
the majority of the points in the j
track events but will be just as badly j
beaten on the field. Captain Clyde i
Jeffrey is, as usual, unbeatable in
the sprints, arid little Ken Battaglia
will give the Club's Ray Dean a |
couple of good races.
CARDS MAY SWEEP 440
Look for a sweep by the great
trio of Indians in the quarter mile.
Blair Hyde and Paul Moore ought
to be able to romp home in this or
der in the 880 unless the old war
horse, Bill McCurdy, ex-Stanford
track captain, starts acting up. Mush
Girard should breeze to victory in
the mile and Burman Skrable may
be the next man back.
Jack Moore will find things tough
in the two-mile with Ed Preston for
his competition. In the high hur
dles, Sid Hayes has a chance of re- I
peating his indoor victory over" Tom j
Moore and Jim Humphreys; and if
he does, he will confirm that rumor
that he is the hurdler on the 1
Coast.
VICKERY FAVORED
However, in the low hurdles, the
Clubmen should, with Earl Vickery !
and Moore running, dominate their
only field event. The relay's five
points will come in mighty handy
for Bill Ellington and his boys if the j
affair is as close as pre-meet dope
sheets make it.
Yesterday afternoon, in prepara- I
tion for Saturday's meet, Dick Simp- j
son skimmed the 220-yard hurdles |
in 24.6; Paul Moore wheeled through i
three laps in 3:02 with Mushy Gir- i
ard right at his shoulder; and Les
Johnson paced Charlie Shaw
through a swift 1:42 660-yard run.
McKENZIE INJURED
It was annovinced that Walt Mc-
Kenzie, Cardinal pole vaulter who !
has gone higher than any other In
dian this year, 13 ft. 5 in., will be
out of competition for about a week
and a half with a badly sprained
ankle.
Paul Moore and Marston Girard j
ran a dead heat Monday in the one- j
mile and (he half race in 6:48.4. That
is (he fastest time ever recorded by ]
Stanford distance runners.
