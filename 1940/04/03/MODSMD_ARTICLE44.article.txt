# To Whom It May Concern

EDITORIALS expressing petty beliefs and
sponsoring insignificant projects are usu
ally unimportant in themselves. An editorial
writer can expound about the war in Europe
or Asia, about Finnish relief, or a third term;
and very often his brilliant but unknowing
words fill the press of the nation.
The words in this column today are based
on intense study of the subject at hand; only
one small source of authority needs to heed our
current suggestions. We ask for no reprints,
no laudations or condemnations in the nation's
news.
We are campaigning for a 25-foot brass rail.
Brass rails have not been newsworthy since
Carrie Nation quit throwing running blocks on
the burly barkeeps back in the days when most
of us weren't even in swaddling clothes.
The Board of Governors of the Stanford Union
has done a commendable bit of construction in
enlarging the Cellar fountain. No longer need
the Cellar hashers worry about collisions on
the blind corners. The new four-lane passage
ways and the additional chair space are a wel
come addition to a constantly improved layout.
But the use of that big and gruesome iron
gate which must have been originally taken
from a tank town calaboose spoils the whole
effect. That's the gate kept two-thirds closed
at the top of the steps to prevent cusomers from
unconsciously walking where they used to tread
before the reformation.
A shiny, brass rail, comparatively inexpen
sive and unquestionably more beauteous,
would take away the jail or dungeon effect in
short order. Any well-equipped junk yard
should have an overabundance of rails in stock.
The rail we advocate for the Cellar of course
will be approximately waist high and not of the
left foot model now seen only in vestigial es
tablishments like Izzy Gomez' and Shanty
Malone's. The additional light and spaciousness
as well as comeliness of the Cellar with a rail
installed will be an established fact.
Hail the Rail!
