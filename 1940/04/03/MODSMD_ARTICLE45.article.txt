THE following headline appeared in the Car
mel Pine Cone at the close of what might be
called "Stanford Week at Carmel-by-the-Sea":
"THEY'RE SWELL KIDS, THESE BOYS AND
GIRLS FROM COLLEGE; HOPE THEY HAD A
GRAND TIME IN CARMEL."
It is a credit to the students who spent Easter 1
Week at Carmel and to Stanford when such a
notice appears in the resort newspaper, usually
the first to voice its anger against the noise and
rowdiness of students relaxing after examina
tions.
The editorial continued saying, "They were
free from studies, free and happy. They made
some noise, caused a little discomfort, packed
taprooms so tightly local citizens couldn't get
in sidewise for a drink. But they didn't do a
thing worth mentioning that would make us
sorry they came here."
A notice such as this is out of the ordinary,
since it is usually a case of the local press con
demning the youth as wild and irresponsible
instead of praising them for their good be
havior.
Other schools both here and at other beaches
on the Coast have achieved records far distant
in the opposite direction; yet Stanford with very
few exceptions has been able to conduct itself
in such a way that the local people and press

praise them for their conduct, wish them to
stay, and ask them to return another time to
their sleepy, quaint villages.
There were incidents where owners of houses
complained that 18 girls rented a house and 27
turned up to occupy it, but this is more humor
ous than a violation of good conduct and the
Pine Cone termed such complaints as "good
natured."
"The invasion of Carmel's musty sanctity by
a band of happy carefree youth from college
is a welcome one."—G. H.
