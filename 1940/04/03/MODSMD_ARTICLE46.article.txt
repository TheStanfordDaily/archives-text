### RE JAN GARBAGE 
r JMrE EDITOR, SIR:
I salute "Smooth" for firing a timely broadside
against the jitterbug music which is so distasteful to
the great majority of Stanfordites. Ordinarily we are
able to choose the right type of band such as Jan
Garber or Gus Arnheim for our musical consumption,
but now I see that Mellinkoff's mental misfits have
signed Duke Ellington and his self-styled "Harlem aris
tocrats of jazz" for the Junior Prom. As a member of
the Stanford family who attends all the jolly-ups and
other campus functions, I wish to protest strongly
against such a choice. I am sure that the dictates of
good taste back me up. We do not want any Voodoo
display or return to our simian ancestors.
Perhaps the "back to the Farm week" encouraged
a return to a more civilized type of music at Stanford
functions. I sincerely hope that our University will not
be changed from the Harvard to the Harlem of the
West.
