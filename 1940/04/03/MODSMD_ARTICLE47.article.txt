### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
AT A TEXAN UNIVERSITY
A USTIN, Texas.—"Remember the Alamo" is no long
er on the lips of every Texan. But Texans
haven't forgotten the Alamo. Davy Crockett, last man
to fall in shooting it out with the Mexican army, and
Sam Houston, avenger of the Alamo slaughter, are
the state heroes. And Texans remember their Civil
War heroes. There are monuments here at the state
capitol to Jefferson Davis, President of the Confeder
acy, and the sharp-shooting regiment known as "Ter
ry's Texas Rangers."
Those wild shooting days, of course, are history.
People don't wear chaps and hitch their pants around
here any more. Austin is a thriving metropolis—with
downtown traffic, big stores, and beautiful "you-all"-
ing women. But the high spirit that Texans are proud
of in their history is still characteristic of the state.
Everything this high-spirited crowd at Texas Uni
versity does, they do in a big way: They are having
student-body elections now, and the campus is flooded
with quarter-cards, small bill-boards, mid hand bills.
"O'Keefe for President" . . . "Sinclair for Editor of
the Texan" . . . "Independents! Elect your man Win
ston!" . . . and "Who is Candidate Carter?"
And their beauty contests (for the title of "Texas
Sweetheart") are organized in a big way, too. Three
hundred women were entered. And frankly, the top
fifty would be sure winner at Stanford.)

yHEIR campus newspaper has a staff in the hun
dreds, is ten pages long (with a thirty-five page
"round-up" edition planned), and the students own a
city-paper sized rotary press which does everything to
the newspaper but read it. The "Texan's" circulation
rivals that of the metropolitan newspapers.
Texas University's academic standing and faculty,
say their rivals at Rice Institute, are rather weak.
But the physical plant has been built with Texan
pride—and money. They have a rare-books library
valued at a million dollars, a student union (comp
arable to our nitery and Union Cellar) which is twice
as big as Toyon Hall, and a 27-story library tower that
makes the Campanile-War Libe argument sound like
a tempest in a teaspoon.
Texas is very proud of its universities and every
thing Texan. And Texans are very cordial, too, but
they insist—at the rate of five words a minute—that
our accents "are most peculiah." "In fact," one Texas
belle told us,'"Yo' all nearly tawks like damned Yan
kees."
Thank God for that word "nearly." (Texans don't
like my first name!)
