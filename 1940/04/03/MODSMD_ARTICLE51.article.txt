# MRS. F.D.R.
## 
### 
Mrs. Roosevelt, unlike her husband, does not give
fireside chats: she Rives kitchenette conferences.
A man named C. V, R. Thompson, who wrote a
book called. "I Lost My English Accent," spreads the
report th;it. Mrs. Roosevelt never goes into a house
but what she ends up in the kitchen.
He himself had heard this story, but was inclined
not to believe it.
But one time there was some sort of a meeting at
some sort of a house, and it was thought advisable at
this meeting at this house to have no liquor around.
However, the gentlemen of the press being invited
en masse, brought their own liquor and kept it in the
kitchen, sub rosa so to speak. Mrs. Roosevelt particu
larly was not to know.
But at one point she wandered blissfully into the
kitchen. .
Mrs. Roosevelt, entirely unlike her husband, is mak
ing nothing but money, however.
