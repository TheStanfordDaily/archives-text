# Woolcottisms Give Sparkle To Curran Hit
## 
### 
"THE MAN WHO CAME TO
DINNER." with Alexander Woolcolt,
now playing at the Curran Theater
in San Francisco.
This piece is written for those
few unfortunate individuals who
have not as yet gotten around to
seeing the George S. Kaufman-
Moss Hail play which has been de
lighting Bay area audiences since
the week before finals.
TOWN-CRIER STARS
Probably this group has already
heard most of the cracks and sit
uations, but right here and now let
me add that they're infinitely fun
nier at first hand than they are at
second or third.
The play is all about Alexander
Woolcott, lhat fabulous character,
who loves odd crimes, Harpo Marx,
and the Seeing Eye, and who as a
reviewer, author, lecturer, and all
round raconteur, has been keeping
himself in the public eye for over
two decades now. This production
boasts the presence of the "town
crier" himself in the title role of
Sheridan Whiteside.
HOWLING SATIRE
Whether Woolcott can act or not
is beside the point; it's his play and
who is better fitted to portray a
famous man than the man him
self".' Authors Kaufman and Hail
have taken every Woolcottism that
ever grew, even to his predilection
for "Over the Waves," and have
woven them into a satire which is a
constant howl.
But Woolcott is not the only great
who is taken for a ride. Noel Cow
ard, Harpo Marx, and international
cafe society in general all come in
for a roasting by the masters. It's
the satire and the lines which make
the play; for as a piece of dramatic
writing, the thing doesn't hang to
gether at all. The plot is poor, and
the devices used to keep the thing
together are nearly crude, they are
so obvious.
COWARD MIMICKED
Better even than Woolcott, how
ever, is the satire on Noel Coward.
Absolutely undisguised under the
pseudonym of Beverly Carlton,
Coward is shown down to the last
minute detail, language, vocal
tricks, walk, gestures; and a gem
within a gem of mimicry is the
Cowardian song written, I under
stand, by Cole Porter, and destined
for that reason never to be pub
lished.
Borah Minnevitch handles the
part of Banjo (Harpo Marx) in a
loud suit and a vaudeville come
dian technique, and Doris Nolan is
an actress and what an actress.—

"THE MAN WHO CAME TO
DINNER." with Alexander Woolcolt,
now playing at the Curran Theater
in San Francisco.
This piece is written for those
few unfortunate individuals who
have not as yet gotten around to
seeing the George S. Kaufman-
Moss Hail play which has been de
lighting Bay area audiences since
the week before finals.
TOWN-CRIER STARS
Probably this group has already
heard most of the cracks and sit
uations, but right here and now let
me add that they're infinitely fun
nier at first hand than they are at
second or third.
The play is all about Alexander
Woolcott, lhat fabulous character,
who loves odd crimes, Harpo Marx,
and the Seeing Eye, and who as a
reviewer, author, lecturer, and all
round raconteur, has been keeping
himself in the public eye for over
two decades now. This production
boasts the presence of the "town
crier" himself in the title role of
Sheridan Whiteside.
HOWLING SATIRE
Whether Woolcott can act or not
is beside the point; it's his play and
who is better fitted to portray a
famous man than the man him
self".' Authors Kaufman and Hail
have taken every Woolcottism that
ever grew, even to his predilection
for "Over the Waves," and have
woven them into a satire which is a
constant howl.
But Woolcott is not the only great
who is taken for a ride. Noel Cow
ard, Harpo Marx, and international
cafe society in general all come in
for a roasting by the masters. It's
the satire and the lines which make
the play; for as a piece of dramatic
writing, the thing doesn't hang to
gether at all. The plot is poor, and
the devices used to keep the thing
together are nearly crude, they are
so obvious.
COWARD MIMICKED
Better even than Woolcott, how
ever, is the satire on Noel Coward.
Absolutely undisguised under the
pseudonym of Beverly Carlton,
Coward is shown down to the last
minute detail, language, vocal
tricks, walk, gestures; and a gem
within a gem of mimicry is the
Cowardian song written, I under
stand, by Cole Porter, and destined
for that reason never to be pub
lished.
