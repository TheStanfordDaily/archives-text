# Nine Elected To Cap, Gown
## Hall, Row Seniors Honored in Ceremony

Winding through the dining rooms
of hall and row living groups, Cap
and Gown chose nine members in
the traditional "tapping" ceremony
on the Wednesday preceding last
quarter's finals. The new members
were all seniors.
Winter selection of new members
is unusual, according to Barbara
Gilbert, president of the honor
society, and was held so new mem

are chosen on a basis of scholarship
and their prominence and achieve
ments in extracurricular activities.
