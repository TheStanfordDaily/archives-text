### WILSON CANNON 
r was magic in the London
air last night.
Usually staid Britishers broke the
age-old rules of English solemnity
as top-hatted Lords mingled with
Eastside cockneys, and solemn
judges set aside their powdered
wigs to hurry from the courts and
join the parades in the streets.
The magic in the air was the name
of Winston Churchill, man whom
London journalists call "the in
comparable," and term the most vital
and pungent figure in the British
public eye today.
Churchill had just been named
the "strong man" of the British
streamlined war cabinet by Prime
Minister Neville Chamberlain. He
was given four and perhaps five
Cabinet positions which amounted
to putting him in complete charge
of England's war strength.
In an extensive Cabinet shakeup
which cut the "War Cabinet" to
eight members, dynamic Mr.
Churchill was named head of the
Army and Air Force commands as
well as the Ministry of Supply — all
these supplementing his year-old
position as First Lord of the Ad
miralty.
In addition to these positions,
United Press reports indicated that
Churchill would probably take over
the duty of Defense Co-ordinator
vacated by the resignation of Lord
Cbatfield yesterday. With or with
out the title, his command of every
branch of the fighting service as
sures him, at least, co-ordination
duties.

r PODAY, at G5, the squat, reddish
haired figure of Britain's man
of the hour is the idol of every
Englishman. They remember his role
in World War I, when, as First Lord
of the Admiralty, he revamped the
broken-down British war machine
in a spectacular flurry of energy and
ability, and aimed it toward Berlin.
Still better they remember him as
the Messiah of the 1929-39 wilder
ness, when he became the leader of
a small group of die-hard imperial
ists who fought the quasi-liberal
Baldwin regime.
These were the years when
Churchill, almost alone among
British politicians, hammered in
cessantly of the peril to England
surrounding Hitlers' rise to power
in Berlin. Alone, at first unheard,
he spoke, wrote, argued, about the
danger of Hitler and especially his
rearmament program in Germany.
He was finally heard, but too late
for Britain to stop the tide of the
Reich and her Fuehrer. Then, with
the Chamberlain Cabinet against
him, he gained the confidence and
hopes of the country. Finally Prime
Minister Chamberlain accepted the
inevitable, and in 1939 Churchill re
entered the Cabinet. Again he be
came the Admiralty's First Lord.

AS he was the first to correctly
appraise Hitler's power, so was
he the first to see that huge-scale
British rearmament was inevitable.
He pushed it from the start, and the
English man on the street feels se
curity in the knowledge that he
will push it even more today.
Stocky, powerfully built, with a
very big head that has earned him
the nickname of the "British Bull
dog" in Berlin, Churchill's personal
courage, energy, and pertinacity are
by-words whenever members of
Parliament get together for a staid
bull session.
He chooses words with delibera
tion, loves rhetoric, and writes as
fluently and well as he speaks.
He lias never pulled a punch.
Last night, his pink cheeks flushed
a ruddy red with pride and deter
mination, Winston Churchill, Brit
ish war-lord de luxe, loomed in the
British eye as the man who would
give them victory. A victory with
no frills and no fancies—but a vic
tory with lasting peace to follow.
No longer will Britishers be
forced to the ignominity of reading
of fleets of English bombing planes
invading the Reich only to drop
pamphlets and propaganda matter.
Churchill will drop explosives — if
that doesn't work he'll probably in
vade Berlin himself in a parachute.

r PODAY, at G5, the squat, reddish

of the hour is the idol of every
Englishman. They remember his role
in World War I, when, as First Lord
of the Admiralty, he revamped the
broken-down British war machine
in a spectacular flurry of energy and
ability, and aimed it toward Berlin.
Still better they remember him as
the Messiah of the 1929-39 wilder
ness, when he became the leader of
a small group of die-hard imperial
ists who fought the quasi-liberal
Baldwin regime.
These were the years when
Churchill, almost alone among
British politicians, hammered in
cessantly of the peril to England
surrounding Hitlers' rise to power
in Berlin. Alone, at first unheard,
he spoke, wrote, argued, about the
danger of Hitler and especially his
rearmament program in Germany.
He was finally heard, but too late
for Britain to stop the tide of the
Reich and her Fuehrer. Then, with
the Chamberlain Cabinet against
him, he gained the confidence and
hopes of the country. Finally Prime
Minister Chamberlain accepted the
inevitable, and in 1939 Churchill re
entered the Cabinet. Again he be
came the Admiralty's First Lord.

AS he was the first to correctly
appraise Hitler's power, so was
he the first to see that huge-scale
British rearmament was inevitable.
He pushed it from the start, and the
English man on the street feels se
curity in the knowledge that he
will push it even more today.

very big head that has earned him
the nickname of the "British Bull

bull session.
He chooses words with delibera

He lias never pulled a punch.
Last night, his pink cheeks flushed

no frills and no fancies—but a vic
tory with lasting peace to follow.
No longer will Britishers be

Cbatfield yesterday. With or with
out the title, his command of every
branch of the fighting service as
sures him, at least, co-ordination
duties.

r PODAY, at G5, the squat, reddish
haired figure of Britain's man
of the hour is the idol of every
Englishman. They remember his role
in World War I, when, as First Lord
of the Admiralty, he revamped the
broken-down British war machine
in a spectacular flurry of energy and
ability, and aimed it toward Berlin.
Still better they remember him as
the Messiah of the 1929-39 wilder
ness, when he became the leader of
a small group of die-hard imperial
ists who fought the quasi-liberal
Baldwin regime.
These were the years when
Churchill, almost alone among
British politicians, hammered in
cessantly of the peril to England
surrounding Hitlers' rise to power
in Berlin. Alone, at first unheard,
he spoke, wrote, argued, about the
danger of Hitler and especially his
rearmament program in Germany.
He was finally heard, but too late
for Britain to stop the tide of the
Reich and her Fuehrer. Then, with
the Chamberlain Cabinet against
him, he gained the confidence and
hopes of the country. Finally Prime
Minister Chamberlain accepted the
inevitable, and in 1939 Churchill re
entered the Cabinet. Again he be
came the Admiralty's First Lord.

AS he was the first to correctly
appraise Hitler's power, so was
he the first to see that huge-scale
British rearmament was inevitable.
He pushed it from the start, and the
English man on the street feels se
curity in the knowledge that he
will push it even more today.
Stocky, powerfully built, with a
very big head that has earned him
the nickname of the "British Bull
dog" in Berlin, Churchill's personal
courage, energy, and pertinacity are
by-words whenever members of
Parliament get together for a staid
bull session.
He chooses words with delibera
tion, loves rhetoric, and writes as
fluently and well as he speaks.
He lias never pulled a punch.
Last night, his pink cheeks flushed
a ruddy red with pride and deter
mination, Winston Churchill, Brit
ish war-lord de luxe, loomed in the
British eye as the man who would
give them victory. A victory with
no frills and no fancies—but a vic
tory with lasting peace to follow.
No longer will Britishers be
forced to the ignominity of reading
of fleets of English bombing planes
invading the Reich only to drop
pamphlets and propaganda matter.
Churchill will drop explosives — if
that doesn't work he'll probably in
vade Berlin himself in a parachute.
