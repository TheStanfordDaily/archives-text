### 
When Herbert Hoover, ex-President of the United States, speaks thii
morning a i 10 o'clock in Memorial Hall his remarks will be strictly off the
record, according to Professor E. E. Robinson, chairman of the Public Ex-
I ercises Committee.
Professor Robinson last night confirmed information received by The
Daily that Mr. Hoover's remarks on foreign and domestic matters will

not bo reported for publication.
Speaking before the first all-Univer
sity assembly of the quarter, for
which 10 o'clock classes will be ex
cused, Mr. Hoover will answer ques
tions which have been submitted by
students and faculty members.
LEADS FINN RELIEF
Mr. Hoover returned to his home
at Stanford last week after a long
stay in the East where he has been
one of the leaders in the much
publicized Finnish Relief drive.
Broached to Stanford's Ex Commit
tee, that body refused to sponsor a
program for the Finns, but later
sanctioned a non-partisan benefit.
From net proceeds of $nOO, $100 was
finally given the Finns.
Students in today's audience will
hear Professor Robinson introduce
the only living ex-President of this
country. Although it has been an
nounced that Mr. Hoover will base
his talk on queries from students
and faculty, no information was
available last night concerning the
definite nature of the questions.
FARM ALUMNUS
Probably Stanford's most noted
alumnus, Mr. Hoover has been a
member of the Board of Trustees
since 1912 and has made his home
on the campus since 1917.
Faculty members and prominent
students will be seated on the stage
at tomorrow's assembly and are
asked by the Public Exercises Com
mittee to enter the stage through the
Green Room. The assembly will
