# Churchill Assumes Lead Of Britain's 'War Effort' In Wide Cabinet Shakeup
## Britons Count on 'Supreme Military' Effort' from Popular Leader; Food, Air, Defense Offices Get New Men 
### 
LONDON, April 3 (UP). —First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Church
ill, Britain's most popular personality of the war, tonight became the
"strong man" of the nation's war effort in an extensive Cabinet shake-up
that affected 11 ministers.
Because of Churchill's ranking as the arch-foe of Naziism and his

desire for smashing blows against
Germany there was speculation
among Britons the war may "really
get started" at last.
Prime Minister Neville Chamber
lain's announcement of the shifts
placed new men in the key posts of
air, shipping, food and defense co
ordination after increasing com
plaints against the government's war
policies.
CABINET WHITTLED
The executive "War Cabinet" of
Chamberlain was whittled down
from nine to eight members with
Churchill administering Britain's
war effort insofar as it. concerns ac
tual fighting. He will preside over
sessions of the Army and Air Force
commands as well as the Ministry
of Supply, in addition to continu
ing - his control over Britain's most
powerful weapon, her Navy.
Figuring in (he shakeup were:
Air Minister Sir Kingsley Wood,
replaced by Lord Privy Seal Sir
Samuel Iloare, with whom he
traded posts after bitter attacks in
Parliament on the slowness of
aviation production.
Minister of Food Supply Wil
liam S. Morrison, replaced by
Lord Woolton, adviser on supplies
to the War Officc.
Minister of Defense Co-ordina
tion Lord Chatficld, resigned after
sending a letter to Chamberlain
complaining that his authority was
crippled because he did not sit in
the "War Cabinet." No successor
was named for Lord Chatficld and
to Churchill probably will fall the
bulk of the authority which he
has held.
Robert S. Hudson, Secretary of
•Overseas Trade, became Minister
of Shipping replacing Sir John
Gilmour, who died last Saturday
in the midst of bitter attacks on
his work.
Kingsley Wood, Morrison and
Gilmour all had been under partic
ularly heavy attacks in Parliament,
in the press and by the public.
SIIAKEUP ESSENTIAL'
Chamberlain explained the shake
up was necessary to "secure full
co-ordination" in the government
and it carried "no reflection" on the
affected ministers.
Although there may be some criti
cism in Parliament and the press
that the changes represent only "a
reshuffling of the old team" the
shifts undoubtedly will find public
favor because of Churchill's in
creased authority.
The one-man reduction in the
War Cabinet is only a small sop to
critics who have been demanding a
four or five-man Cabinet to push
the war more effectively.
The shakeup also involved a series
of lesser shifts.

SIIAKEUP ESSENTIAL'
Chamberlain explained the shake
up was necessary to "secure full
co-ordination" in the government
and it carried "no reflection" on the
affected ministers.
Although there may be some criti
cism in Parliament and the press
that the changes represent only "a
reshuffling of the old team" the
shifts undoubtedly will find public
favor because of Churchill's in
creased authority.
The one-man reduction in the
War Cabinet is only a small sop to
critics who have been demanding a
four or five-man Cabinet to push
the war more effectively.
The shakeup also involved a series
of lesser shifts.
