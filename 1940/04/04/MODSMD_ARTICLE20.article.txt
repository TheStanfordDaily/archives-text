# Encina Schedules Dance for April 12
## 
### 
In spite of the fact that Junior
Prom publicity men are billing the*
Class of '41 affair as "the first dance
of the spring quarter," Encina Club
officers are busy preparing for the
second Encina Club Prom to be held
April 12.
Carvel Craig and his orchestra
have been signed for the affair,
which will feature the spacious En
cina lobby made up as a "Marine
Room" and a surprise theme myste
riously referred to as "The Top of
the Hall."
This is the first, year that the En
cina dance has been open to the
public, last year's affair being a
private hall dance. Club officers
plan to use the proceeds for work
on the Encina Library and other
club projects.
