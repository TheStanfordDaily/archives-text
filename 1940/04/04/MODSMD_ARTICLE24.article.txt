# Lisser to Talk On Gland Work
## Cal Clinic Professor Lectures Tomorrow 
### 
Touching upon a field which has
taken tremendous strides in the
past two decades, Dr. Hans Lisser,
clinical professor of medicine at the
University of California Medical
School, will lecture on "Outstanding
Achievements in Endocrinology" to
morrow evening at 8 o'clock in Lane
Hal], Stanford School of Medicine,
in San Francisco.
Dr. Lisser will discuss diseases of
endocrine or ductless glands, which
are caused either by excessive or
deficient secretion of a hormone,
constituting a disturbance in func
tion. The ductless glands are in
terrelated and interdependent; hence
the aim of precise diagnosis is to
find the precise gland at fault and
to restore it to normal functioning
status.
Surgery is used to cut away and
reduce the secretion of an over
functioning gland, operations re
quiring exceptional surgical skill.
In the case of a disease due to
inadequate secretion of a ductless
gland, the physician has to admin
ister the particular hormone orally,
in tablet or capsule form, absorp
tion through the skin, through the
mucous membranes, or by subcuta
neous or intramuscular injection.
