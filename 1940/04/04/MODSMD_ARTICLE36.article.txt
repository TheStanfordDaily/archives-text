Basketball rules have been chang
ed and altered from time to time in
the past ten years in order to speed
lip the game. The first major rules
affecting the art of stalling by the
team which had gained an advan
tage late in the game.

ABOUT 1» YEARS ago, the Tro
jans put on one of the dullest cage
games before Los Angeles fans when
they played keep-away in the back
court from the Bruins for more than
ten minutes. That brought about a
protest which gradually had been
growing to change the situation.
The tempo of the sport was im
mediately increased 100 per cent
when the national committee ruled
that the offensive team must get
the hall across the center line
within 10 seconds. At the same
time the center iump was elimi
nated. and the team which was
scored against gained possession of
(he casaha.
NEW FOUL RULE
Last year the moguls of basket
ball figured out a new rule which
was supposed to enhance the scor
ing of the losing team. That rule
allowed the team fouled to take the
ball out of bounds instead of taking
the free throws, i.e., a team could
take one shot of two free throws and
then take the ball at the center line.
The rule makers figured that that
way the team behind possibly
could make the iitfht a little closer
and give the fans an added thrill
of a really close game.

TIIE PURPOSE was defeated,
however, when the winning quintet
took advantage of the rule to put
the ball in play from the sidelines
instead of using free shots. It caused
worse stalling than there had been
in the previous eight years.
TEAMS GET ROUGH
The team behind naturally tried
every means to get control and
usually fouled the stalling team
—which in turn look the ball out
side to continue control. It also
made for a rougher game than was
anticipated.
Pacific Coast conference coaches
were almost unanimous in opposing
it at the recent rules meeting in the
East. However, the rule was kept in
effect, and it looks as if the South
ern Division fans will have to put
up with it next year whether they
like it or not.
It certainly hasn't increased the
speed of the game or added to the
thrill of the sport as in the past
when both teams peppered away
at the basket in the closing min
utes.

DID YOU KNOW that over a six
year period (1935-40) Stanford bas
ketballers have scored just four less
lield goals than U.S.C., 1195-1191

B.A.C. publicity director)?
KICK FACES RICE
That Jack Rice, the 145-pound
Indian boxing captain, will marry
Kitty Lawrence. I'i Phi graduate,
next Tuesday morning?
That Stanford's trackmen aren't
the only ones shooting for records?
Roy Vitousek will put in his bid for
a Hall of Fame niche when he goes
after the 50-yard breaststroke mark
here Saturday.
That Big Claude I'urkitt is im
proving every time he steps on
the mound? The last time he faced
the Gaels of St. Mary's he was
pounded for 14 hits. Tuesday night
lie was touched for only seven.

NEW FOUL RULE
Last year the moguls of basket
ball figured out a new rule which
was supposed to enhance the scor
ing of the losing team. That rule
allowed the team fouled to take the
ball out of bounds instead of taking
the free throws, i.e., a team could
take one shot of two free throws and
then take the ball at the center line.
The rule makers figured that that
way the team behind possibly
could make the iitfht a little closer
and give the fans an added thrill
of a really close game.

TIIE PURPOSE was defeated,
however, when the winning quintet
took advantage of the rule to put
the ball in play from the sidelines
instead of using free shots. It caused
worse stalling than there had been
in the previous eight years.

every means to get control and
usually fouled the stalling team
—which in turn look the ball out
