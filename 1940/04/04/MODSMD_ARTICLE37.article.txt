# Frosh Trackmen To Meet All-stars
## 
### 
With particular strength in the
shot - put, a fairly well - balanced
Stanford freshman track team will
meet the Peninsula All-Stars Sat
urday morning at 10 o'clock.
Coach Jack Weierhauser likes to
gloat over his weight men, Hank
Norberg, Ed Stamm, Jack Grey, Ed
Voss. and Bob Millington, but he
fears the All-Stars in the other
events, particularly the sprints and
hurdles.
Bob Smith, quarter-miler, turned
in a 40 flat 352 last night despite a
cold wind in the stretch.
