# Record Spring Grid Turnout Greets Three New Coaches
## 
### 
One of the largest spring turnouts in the history of football at Stan
ford greeted Clark Shaughnessy yesterday when over 100 hopefuls at
tended a meeting called to organize plans for spring practice.
As about a do/en ol those present yesterday are competing in other
sports this spring, the actual number that will report for the lirst drill

tomorrow will probably be between
80 and 90.
Practice sessions will be held Tues
day, Wednesday and Friday during
April, with blackboard drills slated
for Monday and Thursday. From
May 4 until the close of practice
June 1 there will be four sessions
weekly.
WORK OUT TOMORROW
The gridders will work out on the
frosh field tomorrow afternoon.
Equipment is to be issued imme
diately, but shorts will be worn for
i the first three practices. Tomor-
I row's drill will be open to stu
! dents.
Coach Shaughnessy explained
what he expected from the players
in the way of training rules, and
said that every candidate would
have to work and hustle for a berth
on the team. He requested that he
be called simply "Coach" by the
men on the team, instead of "Shag,"
"Get Foxy," "Soup" and the rest of
the nicknames suggested by San
Francisco sports writers.
'"Team morale," he said, "is a
vital factor in a winning ball club.
There'll be no loafing or horse play
on the practice field."
GRAYS TO BE REINSTATED
The Stanford Grays slipped out of
existence three years ago, but will
be reinstated under Shaughnessy.
Husky Hunt will act as coach for
j this group. In the past, several ace
! gridders who had gotten lost in the
| practice shuffle worked up from the
[ Grays to first string posts.
Assistants Coaches Jim Lawson.
Harry Shipkey, Phil Bengtson,
I Marchie Schwartz, and Bernie Mas
| terson wore at the meeting. Schwartz
'will coach the backs, Bengtson and
I Shipkey the linemen, Lawson the
j ends, and Masterson the quarter-
I backs.
All the assistants emphasized the
fact that there is a lot of work to
be done this spring in order to pre
pare for the introduction of the
"Shaughnessy system," whatever it
; may turn out to be, to Coast grid
j irons next fall.
