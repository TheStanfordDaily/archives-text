## 
### 
At an intramural meeting last
night, a new rule for eligibility of
swimmers was adopted. The hew
rule says, "anyone who has repre
sented Stanford or any other uni
versity, college, or junior college in
any scheduled aquatic event is in
eligible for intramural swimming,
except freshmen who after compet
ing in a scheduled event, remain a
full year without competition."
The rule was adopted to eliminate
experienced athletes in swimming
I from participating in intramurals.
Jake Irwin of the B.A.C. store dis
played equipment for Softball and
the meeting adopted shoes with soft
rubber cleats. All spikes were de
clared illegal. Also each organiza
tion is required to furnish a ball
which costs not less than ninety
cents.
Andy Stojkovich, chairman of the
| meeting, appointed a Rules Com
! mittee to look over all intramural
j rules and to submit any suggestions
[ at the next intramural meeting.
