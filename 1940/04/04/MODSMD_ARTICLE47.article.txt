# Farm Trackmen Must Nab Unforeseen Field Victories To Defeat Winged-O Stars
## 
### 
If Rill Ellington's trackstcrs are to keep their seasonal reeord intact
and defeat Olympic Club's great team of present and former stars, they
will have to come through with unexpected places io the field events.
On the track the Cardinals will he all powerful, but in the throw-and
junip events the> appear to he completely outclassed. One of the few

apparent first places for the Indians(
seems to he in the shot put where
hefty Stan Andersen should beat his
former teammate and present club
man, Bill Wohle. Kay Allee of the
Olympic Club, and the fast im
proving Card putters, Bill Trout and
A1 Grey, will all be close in their
tight lor that precious remaining
point.
DISCUS IS WEAK
Andersen, who has taken up the
discus in earnest only this year, will
be the Indians' strongest contender
in this event. But it looks as though
the Winged O's Pete Zagar and Phil
Fox, both former Stanfordites, will
be in front of Stan.
Clubmen Lorren Todd and Johnny
Mottram are favored to lead the
Held in the javelin with Bob Stone,
whose season's best is 200 feet, as
the lone Cardinal hope.
The competition in the broad
jump won't be as tough as it is in
the other events, and the Indians
ought to take another first place if
Ray Brown is in form. Against Cal
in the relays, Ray leaped 23 ft. 10 in ,
as good as his last year's best, and
he plans Thor "Intramural Champ"
Peterson should take a good share
of the points for Ellington's outfit.
WULFF FACES ACES
Stanford's Russ Wulil will find
tough pickings in the high jump. He
faces three men. Mumbert Smith,
Les Steers, and Connie Varneck.
who have all done better than his
best ol 6 ft. 5 in. Yet Russ' con
sistency around 6 ft. 4 in, might
keep him ahead of Smith and Var
neck but will hardly beat the high
soaring Steers.
With two 14-foot pole vaulters,
Cornelius Warmerdam and George
Varoff representing the Olympic
Club in the pole vault it seems that
all the Cards can hope for is that
third place' one point. Yet Indians
Bob Kenyon and Ed Tomaso, with
out the help of their team-mate,
Walt McKenzie, who is out with a
badly sprained ankle, will be hard
pressed for even third place, for the
Club also has Bud Deacon and
Keith Monroe.
Right now on paper the meet
looks like a toss-up. But if only
some of Ellington's throwers and
jumpers can squeeze in here or there
for some unexpected third places, it
would mean a Cardinal victory.
