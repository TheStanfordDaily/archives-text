# Bunn Suggests Housemothers For Row Men
## Annual Report Hits Fraternity Grades, Hell Week Activities 
### 
Containing a recommendation
from Dean of Men John Bunn that
housemothers bo installed in each
chapter house of local fraternities,
expressing disfavor toward "hell
week," and shedding light on facts
and figures of every phase of Uni
versity life, the Annual Report of
the President was issued recently.
Dean Bunn, in his first report as
Dean of Men, reports: "During the
past nine years at Stanford I have
had an opportunity to observe at
close range our fraternity prob
lems. The plan of organization for
the control and guidance of the fra
ternities seems to mc to bo ideal
and in many respects a model for
other universities.

"I do not. believe, however, that
our fraternities as a whole in prac
tice are contributing to the Univer
sity or to the experience of the stu
dents to the extent that is possible
from the very nature of such organi
zations. Records show that consist
ently the influence of the fraternity
has been detrimental to good schol
arship.
"During the past year the frater
nities have created many social
problems which need attention. Also
it is a little difficult to justify the
practices of the fraternities during
"hell week" with the University
regulations in regard to holding
public initiations and hazing.

"I would suggest that the fraterni
ty alumni councils maintain closer
contacts with their respective chap
ters in order that they may give
helpful advice as to the operation of
their houses. I feel sure that if each
fraternity would secure a house
mother, her presence and influence
would add much toward making the
house a real home and giving each
member a mother to turn to at a
time when he is away from his own
home. These factors would tend to
raise the level of our fraternities and
make them a real asset to the Uni
versity."
Further, he states that he consid
ers the autumn quarter Interfrater
nity Council conference a "most
far-reaching step on the part of our
•fraternities toward the building of a
constructive fraternity program
which can have the understanding
and co-operation of all members.

nity Council conference a "most
far-reaching step on the part of our
•fraternities toward the building of a
constructive fraternity program
which can have the understanding
and co-operation of all members.
Containing a recommendation
from Dean of Men John Bunn that
housemothers bo installed in each
chapter house of local fraternities,
expressing disfavor toward "hell
week," and shedding light on facts
and figures of every phase of Uni
versity life, the Annual Report of
the President was issued recently.
Dean Bunn, in his first report as
Dean of Men, reports: "During the
past nine years at Stanford I have
had an opportunity to observe at
close range our fraternity prob
lems. The plan of organization for
the control and guidance of the fra
ternities seems to mc to bo ideal
and in many respects a model for
other universities.
ROW DETRIMENTAL
"I do not. believe, however, that
our fraternities as a whole in prac
tice are contributing to the Univer
sity or to the experience of the stu
dents to the extent that is possible
from the very nature of such organi
zations. Records show that consist
ently the influence of the fraternity
has been detrimental to good schol
arship.
"During the past year the frater
nities have created many social
problems which need attention. Also
it is a little difficult to justify the
practices of the fraternities during
"hell week" with the University
regulations in regard to holding
public initiations and hazing.
MOTHERS MAKE HOME
"I would suggest that the fraterni
ty alumni councils maintain closer
contacts with their respective chap
ters in order that they may give
helpful advice as to the operation of
their houses. I feel sure that if each
fraternity would secure a house
mother, her presence and influence
would add much toward making the
house a real home and giving each
member a mother to turn to at a
time when he is away from his own
home. These factors would tend to
raise the level of our fraternities and
make them a real asset to the Uni
versity."
