IT would take a pretty narrow-minded indi
vidual to truthfully say that Herbert Hoover
is not the outstanding graduate in Stanford's
short history.
There are unquestionably a good many stu
dents who have never been able to see eye to
eye with Mr. Hoover on most of his political
views. If this difference of opinion detracts in
the least from the ex-President's intelligence or
ability, then college has taught us only how to
follow the mob, that surging mass of public
opinion which is quick to forget virtues, quicker
to detect unfortunate flaws.
Herbert Hoover is still the world's greatest
engineer. Had he been elected President in a
prosperous era—such as the boom terms of
Calvin Coolidge—he would have been called
the Messiah of the Twentieth Century.
It is certainly not a matter of politics to re
member here that Hoover's Reconstruction
Finance Corporation is one of the few really
successful agencies of the New Deal. Nor is it
more political to say that seven years after
Hoover, we still have serious trouble between
capital and labor, in agriculture, in unemploy
ment and nearly every other domestic regime.
The New Deal has spent billions to find out that
Hoover was licked by a darn sight more than
his own inability.
Mr. Hoover speaks this morning to a full
campus audience for the first time in over four
years. His willingness to answer student ques
tions and his personal request for as little pub
licity as possible on the meeting itself are in
themselves proof of the non-political aspects
of the affair.
l or most of us, it will be a worthy addition
to our collegiate diaries.
