# Sons of the Wealthy

STANFORD is academically at ease—neither
goaded by the press of examinations nor
slumbering in the usual mid-quarter rest. It's
a good time to revive the old discussion of just
who is the good student.
Some new light was shed on the subject a
few days ago at the University of Louisville by
Professor Lawrence M. Whistler. After testing
all of last fall's entrants, he concluded that
families with prosperous backgrounds, particu
larly the newly rich, furnished more than their
quota of immature students. Best students, on
the other hand, are apt to be from small towns
and large families, he said.
This observation, though in no way conclu
sive, should make someone such as Tuesday's
Campus Opinioner, A New Yorker,'' pause for
a moment. He remarked that "the University
was founded by a wealthy man, and I feel that
its real purpose was to afford an education for
the sons of the wealthy."
The typical Stanford student is neither poor
nor fabulously wealthy. He belongs to that
section of the population known as the middle
class—possibly a little on the upper fringe.
Some Stanfordites, economically speaking,
lapse into the upper brackets, and some into the
lower.
But, socially, most of Stanford shares a com
mon feeling, one that began in Encina and,
somehow, lasted. That common belief would
make most of Stanford agree with today's "Con
tented New Yorker.'' The distinction between
Stanford's rich and poor is much less noticeable
than that in the majority of colleges.
And, perhaps, academically it would be a
tough job for Professor Whistler to make any
predictions on the Farm.—D. H.
