# CAMPUS OPINION
## WE STANFORDITES

r rilE EDITOR, SIR:
this letter represent that large majority of
us who do not wish to l)e included with our obviously
pagan and ignorant writer under the beginning "We
at Skinfold

We at Stanford believe that the eity of New York's
attitude in dismissing Bert rand Russell-was remark
ably well taken. He has been proved to be one of
the most sinful men the world has ever known.
Philosophy is recognized as the most embracing sci
ence in the field of human knowledge, and, in the
chair of philosophy, Russell would have the right to
cover in detail or by casual reference all the filthy
matter ascribed to him.
How dare you talk of academic freedom? I know
damn well what your academic freedom would be
an easy toleration of the best textbook on "The New
Morality" (first edition, 800 8.C.), and a wild en
thusiasm for the professor of the Social Contract on
Campus who says "standards have changed." For
the professor who happens to seriously mention God
or religion in his lectures you would have a smile or
half-hidden sneer as you gently persuade your house
pledges that his courses are "pretty dry and uninter
esting."
That's your paganism. And your ignorance lies in
the fact that you do not realize that all the clever
word play of false logic and all the mathematics in the
world is not so important as word from a professor
expressing Christian good faith. *
