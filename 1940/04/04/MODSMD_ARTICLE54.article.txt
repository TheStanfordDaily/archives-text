r A NEW YORKER, SIR:
In regard to your letter, very narrow minded
indeed ,your conclusions are based on unfounded
facts. May I suggest that, you spend a few of your
leisure hours reading a little of the background of the
University? I am sure that you will find that Senator
Stanford intends this school to be for those that were
unable to "pay for an education.
If you expressed your ideas truthfully, I would
suggest that you pack your belongings and travel back
across those 3000 miles and hang your hat in one of
those eastern schools for the sons of the filthy rich.
Your inference to the ideals of Stanford would
not be accepted in the best of circles, even among the
"rich" man's schools of the East.

P S.: Why don't you and "'4O from Paly" get together
and have a bull session?
