BULL-NECKS, BICEPS, AND BRAINS
J JOUSTON, Texas.—Rice Institute is one of the
brainiest schools in the Syuth. It specializes in
turning out Phi Betes in Chemistry and Engineering.
But brains make business, and business at Rice is Ath
letics. So competing with math majors in populating
the campus are bull-necked, mammoth-shouldered
men of brawn; they make Joe Louis look like an
aesthete.
There is very little pretense about amateurism at
Rice. Atherton doesn't speak their language. Ap
parently the Board of Athletic Control just buys good
performers, and athletes and scholars think of the
athletes as paid empolyees. This system may bring
Rice a nice return on its investment, but it doesn't
promote the ultimate in democratic spirit on the
campus.
"Sorry you boys are staying in the dorm," our host
told us. "All the P.E.'s (i.e., athletes) live there." And
the connotation was, "Athletes are pretty low around
here; we've got a caste system."
The Athletes seem to recognize their fifth estate
position, and they express school spirit, aside from paid
athletic performances, in fire-hose water fights. But
some of the Rice athletes may well be the envy of
brilliant chemists. Fred Woolcott, world's greatest
hurdler, is a blond Adonis that Hollywood is foolish
to overlook.

INSTITUTE has, in a sense, carried subsidized
athletics to its logical extreme; they maintain high
scholastic standards, and at the same time carry on
athletics as an efficient business. But if the athletic
caste is the logical extreme of subsidized athletics, it
is probably a good thing that Coast schools have agreed
to find a logical middle course.
It isn't that Rice athletes are underprivileged in a
material sense. Fred Woolcott, according to one of his
laundry customers, makes more than the average chem
ist does after graduation. And he drives an alumnus'
gift that would delight Houston's most exclusive belles.
But regardless of what one may take for granted
at Stanford, Rice makes one appreciate the feeling
that Norm Standlee and Clyde Jeffrey are different
from the rest of us only in their athletic ability. The
Trojans may not understand this. But let's hope Ath
