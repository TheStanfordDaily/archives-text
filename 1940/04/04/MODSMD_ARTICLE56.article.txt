Two cars running parallel to each other on El Ca
mino stopped together when the signal turned red at
Mayfield.
In one car there were nothing but women, hut it
was dark.
In the other car there were nothing but women, but
it was dark.
The women in one car yelled across, "Do you have
any men in there?"
And the answer coming across from the other car
was, "No, not here, but I have two at home; one
extra. Come on."
The signal turned green. Both cars raced for Palo
Alto.
