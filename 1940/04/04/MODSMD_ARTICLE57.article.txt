I can remember way back when only part of the
typewriters here in the Shack were nailed down to
their benches, but now they are all nailed down. Yes,
one was stolen last spring. Someone came and took
it away.
Yesterday he brought it back. He slipped .in here
in the dark of the night and left it on a table.
It was a wreck. It's no damn use at all. So he
brought it back.
It had a brand new ribbon, however.
