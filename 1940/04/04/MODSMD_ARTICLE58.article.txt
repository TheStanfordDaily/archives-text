# OH. WHAT YOU SAID

Reading, they tell me, is broadening; if not down
right contusing. I have absorbed these startling facts
from a few of our recent magazines:
1. Charles Boyer was (a) once the toast, the abso
lute toast, of Paris, and got around plenty, (b) During
this time Boyer smoked 200 cigarettes a night. Now
assuming a night for a man like Boyer is 12 hours,
which is a lot of night, he would have four minutes
to smoke each cigarette, and no time out for coughing
or anything. That wouldn't leave him much time to
do all those things the magazine intimated he did.
2. Jean Arthur, who is a movie actress, is admit
tedly two-faced, having one face painted on for her
pictures and the real McCoy for her husband and
friends, but doesn t want it to get around too much.
3. Germany is certain to have a revolution some
time. It may not come until after Germany owns
hurope, but it will come. Hitler or someone may be
killed.
4. Swing music gave birth to the jitterbug and the
jitterbugs in turn gave birth to swing music in a very
vicious circle, and now they are both fast at work
killing each other oIT.
