# Farm Junior Airs First-hand Views of European Situation
## 
### WALT STOLSSEL 
(Editor's Note: This is the first of a series of articles on the author'*
observations made while studying in Europe. He returned to the Farm
a few weeks ago because of the increasing war crisis.)

Will the long-;»u;uted "Big Push" start this spring—or will the two
armies facing each other across the Rhine continue to sit out the dance
of death until next fall? Mosf European observers answer that question

much as did William Philips, Ameri-«
can ambassador to Italy, when I ask
ed him what he thought of the possi- |
bilities of a general offensive starting
this spring.
He said, "Well, the fighting might
start this spring, but then again it
may not. I don't know." Nobody else
seems to know much more.
PEACE CHANCE SEEN
If the present so-ealled "Sitzkrieg"
could be kept up for a few more
months, there is some chance that the
warring countries could come to an
agreement. In that possibility lies the
only hope for Europe. Once the
stalemate is ended and the big
pushes get under way the situation,
chiefly the question of what will
come after the war, would become
so chaotic and hopeless that it is
almost impossible to see a way out.
Many observers in Europe feel
that there is good reason to believe
that there will be no great offensive
launched for many months. All the
talk one hears in England and
France is of a German offensive
people rarely mention the proba
bilities of a French or English at
tack.
NAZIS STRONG
And Germany is in a stronger po
sition now than at the beginning of
the war—she could well afford to
wait another year and would will
ingly do so if it was felt that a
peace could be arrived at which
would permit Germany to keep her
advances in central Europe. The
month of March, Hitler's favored
month for action, in which many
people felt Germany would attack,
has come and gone without any ma
terial change in the situation. It is
possible that Hitler will choose to
wait out the summer months. He
can afford to.
When I left Italy a month ago, the
thing that most impressed me in the
European situation was the strength
of Germany's position. It appears to
be well-nigh impenetrable. To the
north, the Scandinavian countries
are sympathetic to the Reich. Swed
en is supplying much of Germany's
mineral needs—almost three-fourths
of the country's copper and iron go
ing into Germany.
In the East. Russia backs Germany
up. It is impossible to say what
will come out of the Russ-German
pact—almost anything could. Cer
tainly the Allies will have to recog
nize her as a belligerent before they
start any offensive against Germany.
HITLER'S BACKING
Rumors are rife in Europe. There
are many people who feel that the
final upshot may bring Germany to
do an about-face again; join with
England and France against Com
munism. After what has happened
in the last year, one feels that al
most anything could happen. The
German people, although appreciat
ing the help Russia can give them,
fear their neighbor to the east, and
dislike the idea of co-operating with
the Bolshevists. In Germany, they
say that Stalin is busy writing a
book called "Sein Kampf, Mein
Sieg" (His Struggle, My Victory).
DISLIKE SOVIETS
The sight in the newsreels of a
German officer discussing plans with
a Russian officer is enough to set a
German muttering under his
breath, despite the Gestapo. But the
treaty, whatever its worth, exists.
Russian food and oil have already
begun to be delivered into Ger
many, and German technicians are
hard at work in Russia attempting
to improve and straighten out the
tangled production and transporta
tion systems.
Russia, however potentially dan
gerous she might be, must be con
sidered as Germany's ally. I per
sonally feel she will remain as such.
