ONE0 NE of the war's ghost ships slip
ped into Honolulu yesterday
afternoon.
No lei-carrying crowd of island
ers was at the dock to fete the ves
sel and her passengers. Hula danc
ers stayed away.
The vessel was the huge 36,000-
ton British liner Mauretania. Gray
daubed, almost comical in her ap
parent effort at inconspicuousness,
her arrival was a surprise to Hono
lulu except for members of the
British consulate and American cus
toms officials.
Second only to the German liner
Bremen insofar as World War II
mystery ships are concerned, the
Mauretania sailed from New York
harbor March 20. Her departure
was clouded with secrecy.
Not even those generally best in
formed in American news circles
were aware of the wheres-or-whys
of the huge ship's journey. Specu
lations as to her whereabouts ab
ruptly ended yesterday with the
official dispatches concerning her
arrival in Honolulu.
Seemingly most predominant of
all "Mauretania stories" claimed
she was en route to Australia to
carry troops of Anzacs to the scene
of fighting activities in Europe.
* * *
|>UT Honolulu is far north of the
ordinary Panama - Australia
route. Present theory holds that the
Mauretania either is dodging regu
lar steamer lanes or headed toward
the British possession of Hong Kong.
Each theory has its advocates, many
consider that the real reason is a
conglomeration of both.
At any rate, the one fact over
which there can be no speculation
is the fact that the big vessel was
almost gazelle-like in her approach
to the Islands—attempting to avoid
possible Nazi submarines.
She was smudged a dirty grey to
decrease visibility. She was held at
half-speed to avoid suspicion.
And. until she was just off the
Makapu lighthouse, around the
island from scenic Diamond Head
point, the Mauretania flew no en
sign to signify whether she was a
merchantman or a war vessel.
Not until her prow had turned
into the famed Molokai channel be
tween the islands of Molokai and
Oahu did she hoist her pennant. It
was a tiny blue ensign, signifying
that her captain was a naval reserv
ist, and that the ship was traveling
as an ordinary merchantman.
Tiny coast guard patrol ships
buzzed minutely about the huge
vessel as she entered the harbor.
Customs officials were everywhere.
Water supply lines were attached
to the vessel immediately after
docking. But no gangplank was low
ered. Instead, orders were given
that no crewmen would be permit
ted ashore.
* it
/ kNLY gun visible on the ship was
a three-inch piece on the stern
deck. Much stress was put on this
fact in news dispatches, for preced
ing her New York departure rumor
had it the Mauretania was to be
heavily armed.
Strictest care is to be exercised,
during the as yet undetermined pe
riod that the ship will remain in
port, by customs officials. Their sur
veillance is expected to closely con
form to every aspect of continental
American neutrality legislation.
No date for (he departure of the
vessel was available yesterday.
But the consensus held that the
ship would weigh anchor as soon
as refueling operations were con
cluded. Reason given was the
longer the stay, the closer-knit
the cordon of searching German
underwater-dogs.
The Mauretania is one of two
British liners at present on the run
for home and safety. The Queen
Mary, which left New York shortly
after her sister-ship, is still unheard
from. The Queen Elizabeth and the
Normandic are still in New York.
But, even if the Queen Elizabeth
pulled into Honolulu Princess Papuli
and her papaia would stay at home.
