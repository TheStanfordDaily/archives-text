# Second Year Growing Pains Attack Co-Op
## 
### ROSEMARIE MULLANY 
Down in the basement of the
Women's Clubhouse the co-opera
tive movement is getting its start at
Stanford. The recently reorgan
ized Book Exchange has just passed
the first anniversary mark and is
now thinking in terms of expansion,
board of directors' meetings, and
general policies.
The exchange, which was organ
ized on a shoestring and a few
books Winter Quarter of '38 as a
subsidiary of the A.S.U. is now in
dependently organized as a co-oper
ativc and its wobbly shelves hold
2000 books.
CRAMPED QUARTERS
The business area of the Ex
change extends back from the
counter about 8 feet and at the
widest point is no more than 4 feet.
When more than two clerks are
working, the place looks like the
scene of a psych experiment.
Russ Curtis, the present manager,
says that expansion is imminent.
Right now the overflow of Spanish,
German, and sociology books is
stocked in the kitchen of the club
house along with the files and cash
box.
SHOE BOX FILES
Speaking of files, they consist of
four shoe boxes. The cash box is a
converted fishing tackle box.
Under the present working ar
rangement every customer who
joins the society (fee, 25c) has one
vote in choosing the board of direc
tors and in determining the general
policy. The board of directors han
dles the business, selects the man
ager, and approves the employees
appointed by the manager.
Today is somewhat of a milestone
for the exchange. The new board
of directors meets for the first time
this afternoon to start its duties.
Newly elected, its members are Bob
Low, Lin Moses, Bob Peckham,
Walter Tsang, John Moore.
CHECKS MAILED
The post office is also handling
today the first of over 180 checks
amounting to $300 which are being
sent to owners of books which have
been sold this week at the exchange.
Manager Curtis has discovered a
saying of Senator Stanford's which
he feels justifies and should en
courage co-operatives at Stanford.
The Senator spoke to the first board
of trustees of the "great advantage
of co-operation, by which each indi
vidual has the benefit of the intel
lectual and physical forces ol his
associates."
