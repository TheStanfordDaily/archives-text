## Drastic Action Necessary to Help Maintain Farm's Financial Balance; Faculty, Students Submit Queries 
### JEFF LITTLE BOY 
Stanford I.Diversity's financial situation is pointing for a crisis, Ex-
Presidcnt Herbert Hoover revealed yesterday in the lirst all-University
assembly of spring quarter. Mr. Hoover blamed the artificial lowering of
interest rates as a partial cause of the deficit.
"We must keep endowed schools free of tax support ui order to pre-

serve educational liberty," hp said.
The prominent Stanford alumnus
intimated drastic measures may
have to be taken in order to main
tain the school's financial balance.
Selecting 11 questions from over
2.") submitted by students and fac
ulty, Mr. Hoover told a capacity au
dience his views on major world and
domestic problems. Previously
planned as ''off the record," Mr.
Hoover opened his address to quo
tation at the last minute.
MIGRANT PROBLEM
In his opinion, the California
migrant problem Is a direct result
of cotton policies in the South, 90
per cent of the migrants arc South
ern sharecroppers, not Dust Bowl
refugees, he asserted.
Mr. Hoover indicated that reset
tling the migrants on 3 to 5-acre
homes through the agricultural sec
tions of the country, giving them a
"root in the soil," would be his solu
tion to the problem.
Discussing the European situation
in general, Mr. Hoover hoped for an
early peace, but believed it would
be Carthaginian rather than Utopian.
So far the hates and enmities gen
erated by the war have not been in
tense, but when major damage is
done, hate will reach an unprece
dented velocity, Mr. Hoover pre
dicted.
FINNISH RELIEF
Answering a query on the admin
istration of his own project, the
Finnish Relief Fund, the ex-Presi
dent said the fund's purpose was to
care for over 700,000 Finnish women
and children made homeless by the
"barbaric attack" of the Russians.
Of the Russo-P'inn treaty Mr.
Hoover said:
"Immoral treaties can never sur
vive; nor ones based on immoral
terms."
The Stanford alumnus declared
that the h ei 'oic defense put up by
the Finns pricked the bubble of the
mighty Communist army, and shifted
the destiny of the present European
war by relieving (he smaller nations
of their fears.
INTERNATIONAL
Mr. Hoover added five more
Horsemen to the original four of
the Apocalypse when he named Im
perialism, Collectivism, Atheism,
Hate, and Intolerance potential de
stroyers of mankind. He cited the
United States as the possible savior
of civilization after the present con
flict ceases.
Youth's employment problem, Mr.
Hoover said, is tied in with the gen
eral employment problem in the
United States. General employment;
under free enterprise involves the
restoration of initiative of entrepre
neurs, lie asserted. He quoted sta
tistics showing 90 per cent of the
graduating class will have jobs with
in GO days of graduation.
NATIONAL AFFAIRS
With 15 to 18 million persons sup
ported on various forms of relief,
the ex-President indicated that the
use of United States surpluses to
ameliorate their lot is the country's
first duty. He asserted that the ma
jority of relief problems are caused
by maladministration.
"It is the first duty of the Ameri
can people to support America," Mr.
Hoover declared.
