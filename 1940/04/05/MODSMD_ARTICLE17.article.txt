# Mellinkoff Out; Chaos Looms In Nominations
## A.S.S.U. Presidential Field Opens; Row, Halls Slate Caucuses 
### ROWAN HALL 
Because Sherman MellinkofT—jun
ior class president, debater, bull-ses
sioner, Encina sponsor, and minia
ture dynamo extraordinary—does not
choose to run for A.S.S.U. president,
Stanford politics, both Hall and Row,
enter this week-end in a state of
chaos.
With nominations set for next
Tuesday and Wednesday and cau
cuses scheduled Tuesday night, po
liticos on both sides of the fence are
busily beating the bushes for can
didates. A lack of available out
standing talent in the class of '41
has created what is virtually an open
field.
Before leaving on his transconti
nental debate tour, MellinkofT, who
dopesters figured would walk away
with the election, definitely stated
that he would not run and asked
his friends not to nominate him.
His reason is that he expects to enter
medical school next year.
ROW PROSPECTS
With the major Hall threat defi
nitely oul of the way, the Row has
sprouted a forest of presidential tim
ber this week. Fair-haired boy of
the Upper Row is Greyson Bryan,
Phi Psi, chairman of the A.S.S.U.
Lecture Series and the Junior Prom.
Down on the Lower Row the Phi
Delts are booming blond Art Gore,
co-chairman of the Student-Faculty
Field Day and president of his fresh
man class. At the same time com
petition looms across the street at
the S.A.E. house in Bob Newell, de
bater and chairman of last year's
Sophomore Carnival.
Handsome, football-playing Chick
i Orme probably will be the candidate
i from the Zete manse, and Delta Chi
Ned Pugh, Pre-registration chair
man, Encina sponsor, Cardinal, and
rugbyman, is reputed to have a
strong organization behind him.
POTENTIAL SPLIT
Hugh O'Donnell, Theta Xi. a major
cog in the Pugh machine, may bolt
and run in his own right, rumor has
it. Considered a strong potential
Row candidate, Bruce Jessup, chair
man of Men's Vocational Guidance
and a member of the Non-partisan
Relief Fund Committee, will not be
eligible to run because he is not reg
istered in school this quarter.
The sole chance of the Halls to
i win the A.S.S.U. presidency seems to
l lie in lanky Jack Alltucker, El Toro,
J Encina sponsor, basketball player,
j nnd co-inventor of "Back to the
Farm."
MellinkofT and Bryan arc close
j personal friends, and it. is generally
| believed that the Phi Psi will enter
j the race with the blessings of the
! Hall man. Questioned yesterday
j about a telegram he was aoout to
send MellinkofT, Bryan asserted that
I he was merely going to wish him
luck in one of his debates ".because
i I didn't get a chance to say goodbye
I to him when he left."
Although the Women's Nominating
j Committee met yesterday and will
1 meet again today behind closed doors
I to pick its recommendations, English
Corner talk has it that Anne Town
send, Lagunita, former Roble spon
sor, and sophomore woman on Ex
Committee, will be the Hall candi
date for vice-president of the Asso
cated Students.
Pi Phi Betty Moses, Cardinal and
prominent committee woman, is ex
pected to gain the support of the Row
for this office. Chairman of this
year's Conference County Fair Mar
tha Nordling, flying Deegee, prob
ably will get the Nominating Com
mittee's nod for chairman of Wom
en's Conference.
For president of the senior class
the only prominently mentioned pos
sibility on the Row is "Red-hot" Bill
Turner, Delt, chairman of "Back to
the Farm' and former sophomore
man on Ex Committee. The Halls
may run Fred Hudson, EI Toro,
member of Rally Committee, and
prominent in Hall affairs, or Dwight
Hutchinson, Toyon manager, Daily
associate editor, and committeeman

Ross Anderson, A.T.O. committee
man, is the only candidate mentioned
for senior man on Ex Committee at
' this stage of the game.
Rowmen who are being groomed
for junior class president include
Delt Jim Haugh. Alpha Delt Bob
Breckner, A.T.O. Bob McNeil, and
Beta Jim McKellar.
Sequoia always prominent and
powerful in politics, has yet to .show
any sign of life. However, its well
oiled machine is expected to swing
into action in time for the meeting of
Interclub Council next Monday eve
ning at El Cuadro at which candi
dates will be picked.
The official Hall caucus will as
semble Tuesday night in Toyon
lobby to rubberstamp the Council's
selections—unless someone tampers
with the tracks.
