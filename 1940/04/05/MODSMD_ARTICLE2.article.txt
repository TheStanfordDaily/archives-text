# Chamberlain Cabinet Hit By Critics
## "Victory Ten Times More Certain,' Says Anglo Prime Minister 
### 
LONDON, April 4 (UP). —
Prime Minister Neville Chamber
lain today met complaints against
his "puss-in-the-corner" Cabinet
reorganization with an assertion
he is "ten times as confident of
victory" as he was when the war
started seven months ago.
While the public and press re
acted critically to the Cabinet shake
up, despite the fact fiery Winston
Churchill gained broad authority
over the strategic conduct of the
war, the 71-year-old Prime Minister
pushed measures aimed at strangling
Germany economically.
The biting comment of the press
indicated the reshuffling might, be
only temporary leading to a drastic
shake-up at some later date.
In the face of the criticism, the
government today pushed its war
efforts with these developments:
1. Chamberlain said in a speech
that in Britain's intensified eco
nomic warfare "the strangling ef
fect of the blockade will more and
more drain the life blood out of
our enemy" and that "Hitler miss
ed the bus" because he failed to
wage big-scale warfare at the out
set of the war. This seven-months
breathing space, said Chamberlain,
has given the Allies the strength
they need.
2. Chamberlain announced a se
cret session of the House of Com
mons will be held next Thursday to
debate the program for intensified
economic warfare, a subject "of
great importance and one which
perhaps might be difficult to debate
in public."
3. Ronald Cross, Minister of
Economic Warfare, told Commons
the question of a $08,000,000 in
crease in United States exports to
Italy. Russia, Holland, Belgium,
Switzerland and Scandinavia over
a four-months period ending in
December was being "watched
and reviewed" to learn whether
the United States might be indi
rectly supplying the Nazis.
4. Chancellor of the Exchequer
Sir John Simon, given greater au
thority in the economic warfare un
der the Cabinet reshuffle, revealed
the creation of a new organization
aimed at wresting away Germany's
markets or potential markets in Bul
garia, Greece, Hungary, Rumania,
Turkey, and Jugoslavia.
While Chamberlain was telling
the Central Council of the domi
nant national union of conserva
tive and unionist associations that
Britain is ready for an intensified
war or a long one, the British
press struck at his Cabinet shifts
with bitterness and sarcasm.
Chamberlain in his speech before
the council of the national union
which represents 387 of the 615 scats
in Commons, referred obliquely to a
threat, yesterday by Field Marshall
Hermann W. Goering that Germany
is ready to "strike in the West" and
end the war.
Britain ir. fully ready for what
ever Germany may attempt,
Chamberlain said.
Germany, the Prime Minister as
serted, has not a real friend in the
world—only neutrals who are afraid
of her and who know in their hearts
that an Allied victory spells free
dom for them. He dwelt at length
upon the blockade, always Britain's
strongest weapon, and one which is
to be tightened now.
The Prime Minister pointedly told
the neutrals Britain intended to
clamp a tight blockade on Germany
and would not be deterred by the
technicalities of neutrality.
