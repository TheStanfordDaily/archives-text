# Hilgard Wins Psych Medal For Studies
## Stanford Professor Revises Conditioned Response Theories 
### 
For researches which have forced
revision of the classic theory that
conditioned responses are strictly
automatic and beyond the control of
the will, Ernest R. Hilgard, Stanford
professor of psychology, has been
awarded the Howard Crosby War
ren medal, one of the outstanding
honors in psychology.
In presenting the award, the So
ciety of Experimental Psychologists
cited Professor Hilgard "lor his
analysis of the conditioned response
and his demonstration of its inte
gration with the verbal and volition
al processes in learning and reten
tion."
RESPONSES MODIFIED
In less formal language, this
means that his experimental work,
much of it conducted with Stanford
students as subjects, has shown con
ditioned responses to be very much
modified by the subject's attitudes
and by his voluntary efforts to con
trol what happens.
In one experiment,'students were
subjected to sudden puffs of air
striking the eye. A light was flashed
on just before the jet of air was
released. After a while, the eye
would blink at the flash of light,
even though the puff of air were
withheld.
DOG DISAPPOINTED
Up to this point the subject's be- !
havior was in conformity with the
classic theory of Pavlov, who condi
tioned a dog so that when a bell
rang its mouth would water, whether
or not food were placed before it.
Hilgard, however, went on to show
that the student-subject's response
to the light flash was modifiable. It
could be controlled by an effort of
the will. In turn, this finding opens
the way to study of the suscepti
bility of different persons—different
psychological types of persons —to
controlling their responses through
will power.
