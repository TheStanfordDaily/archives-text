### 
WASHINGTON, April 4 (UP).â€”
Amid cries of "throw him out," the
Dies Committee today ejected Phil
Frankfeld, executive secretary of
the New England Communist party,
from its hearing room and made
him No. 5 on its contempt citation |
list of recalcitrant Communist wit
nesses.
Frankfeld precipitated the furor
by refusing to answer questions un
til he could read a resolution con- |
demning the committee's recent raid J
on Boston Communist headquar
ters. Lustily pounding his gavel,
Chairman Martin Dies, D., Tex.,
shouted:
"You are held in contempt of this j
committee!"
