# Wilbur's Annual Report Cites Growth of J.C. Competition
## 
### BUD AMES 
According to the recently pub
lished "Annual Report of the Presi
dent of Stanford University for the
Year Ending August, 1939," the
mushroom, overnight growth of jun
ior colleges in California is proving
"seriously embarrassing to institu
tions of higher education such as
Stanford.
"The advance of junior colleges,
both in numbers of institutions and
in the size of the student bodies, is
disturbing the original mechanism
of the four-year colleges and state
teachers' colleges," the report states.
"These tendencies present a dilemma
that is almost an emergency at the
present time in California."
JAYSEES THREATEN
The report, published annually by
the University Press, continues, ex
pressing a fear that these junior
colleges will become four-year col
leges once they can be state-sup
ported. As such they will "do great
harm to the fine educational struc
ture that has been built up in recent
decades" since "there is only so much
money available for education in the
state."
Summarizing Stanford's latest
complete year, the report mentions
academic progress which has been
brought about through the organi
zation of the School of Social Sci
ences.
CO-ORDINATION
This school has "made it possible
at Stanford to bring about some co
ordination in these fields: history,
political science, economics, social
science, and sociology. It is in this
area that we have the most discus
sion of public problems and the most
criticism."
Complementary light is also
thrown on the recent development
of research through gifts made to
Stanford. "In reviewing the gifts
made to the University during recent
years, we find that there h<us been a
steady flow from various sources,
particularly the Rockefeller Rounda
tion, of funds to support research al
ready established in the University,"
the report declares.
"It would be of great advantage
to the University if this fund—the
small general research fund of $4,000
—could be at least $20,000."
BIOLOGY GRANT
The report lauds the $200,000 out
right grant made for the support of
work in biology, and the $15,000
giant for the development of Far
Eastern studies until 1944. Important
mention is also made of the academic
>1 rides taken by the Guggenheim
Aeronautical Research Laboratory,

and of the recent selection of Stan
ford as a civilian aviation training
center by the Civil Aeronautics Au
thority.
Concluding the report on academic
progress, the report cites the return
of faculty salaries to 95 per cent of
their standings at the time the 10
per cent cut was made, and promises
that "every effort will be made to
continue this program until the full
100 per cent is again in force.''
