# Luncheon Club Hears Traveler
## Anne Guthrie Speaks On Java, Far East 
### 
"Spread out your world—move
outside your own closed clique—
learn what the fellow in the next
corner is doing and thinking!" Thus
admonished Miss Anne Guthrie,
Stanford graduate, Far Eastern trav
eler, and dynamic speaker, when she
spoke at the Luncheon Club meeting
yesterday at 12 o'clock in the Nitery.
Drawing in photographic instances
of her life and work in the Philip
pines, Java, China, and Korea, Miss
Guthrie gave a unique formula for
interesting and useful living. Pictur
ing the world as a huge flat checker
board with horizontal lines repre
senting degrees of security and ver
tical lines of differences of race, na
tionality and political thought, she
stressed the importance of "spilling"
over into one another's squares, to
relieve pressure and achieve broth
erhood.
TALKS PRO-CHINA
Talking pro-China but with a
definite realization that China's op
pressor must be compromised and
not • condemned, Miss Guthrie
stressed the Chinese slogan of to
day, "Resist and construct." She
told of a unique Chinese student
center in Yunan, situated in a series
of caves, where plans for a new
democratic China are born and prac
ticed. Facilities there arc poor. From
there, these young leaders of the new
Asia go out in China to preach the
gospel of a "new China" and co
operation with Japan.
The Japan-China conflict is one of
ideas, basically, averred the speaker.
It is the exalted militarism of the
Japanese -ersus the exalted scholas
ticism of the Chinese.
CO-OPERATION URGED
Co-operation and intelligence are
necessary to solve other problems
such as the illustration of China and
Japan, stressed Miss Guthrie. Col
lege students were urged to stretch
their imaginations, broaden their
views, make connecting links and
contacts, and "keep a scientific at
titude toward facts, but a loving at
titude toward people."
Luncheon Club will be held next
week on Wednesday, April 10, as
usual. The speaker will be an
nounced later, according to Dr. D.
Elton Trucblood, faculty adviser.

The gasoline lax, which recently
marked its 21 st anniversary, has
yielded approximately 8 billion dol
lars in revenue from American
motorists.
