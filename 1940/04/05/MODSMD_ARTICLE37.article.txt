# Swedes Resist British Effort To Buy Metals
## English Ask Increase Of Iron Ore Exports To Stave Germans 
### 
STOCKHOLM, April 4 (UP).—
Sweden will resist any British effort
to buy up her exportable iron ore
output as a means of starving the
German war machine, officials inti
mated today while an Anglo-Swedish
trade group consulted here.
Reports that Charles Hambro of
the British Ministry of Economic
Warfare, now in Stockholm, had
asked an increase in ore shipments
to Britain under the two countries'
trade pact of last January were de
nied in official circles.
The joint commission, it was said,
merely is discussing practical ap
plication of the treaty's terms.
SWEDES APPREHENSIVE
News of the reshuffling of the
British cabinet, following closely
upon announcement that the Allies
will intensify their economic war
fare—particularly in regard to Scan
dinavian ore deliveries to Germany—
was received with intense interest
and considerable apprehnsion in
Swdish political circles.
The increase in the powers of Win
ston Churchill indicated to Swedish
observers that Britain intends to
conduct the war on a more realistic
basis and that Sweden must be alort
against any new perils to her neu
trality.
REPORTS DOUBTED
Informed quarters doubted reports
originating abroad that Germany
contemplates sending an expedition
ary force of 400,000 troops across the
Baltic to protect her Scandinavian
ore routes.
There have been reports tnat uer
many had canceled all consignments
of Swedish ore en route by rail to
the Norwegian port of Narvik on the
North Sea and had assembled a fleet
of small craft at German Baltic ports
and advised the Scandinavian nations
that she had several hundred thou
sand men ready to embark in them
for Scandinavia if necessary pro
tect her vital ore supply.
