When athletes at most college:
work hard over a long period ol
time, there is usually some sort ol
an award attached. The same is
true at Stanford in only a couple
oi cases —football and basketball.
♦ #
THE FOOTBALL TEAM—usually
about 155 of 'em—get travelling jack
ets on their jaunts up and down the
Coast . . . but a lot of those grid
ders don't get Block S's.
'I lie basketball team usually
gets a couple of swell trips and
perhaps a junket around the
country. It's true that not all of
them—not even as high a percent
age of them as football—get the
Block S—hut they do get travel
ing jackets, which amounts to
some sort of an award for their
long hours 011 the court.
But. that's as far as the B.A.C.
goes in handing out jackets — you
know the kind—the red sleeves and
leather coat.
THE ONLY ATHLETIC squad
which practices from October 1 to
June 15 is the track team. Like the
other sports, only a certain number
will win letters. (They have to
place in either the California, or
U.S.C. meets.)
A (rip to Washington to meet
cither the Huskies or the Cougars
was called off for spring vaca
tion. This wasn't Stanford's fault
—the hoys 115) there just couldn't
see their getting beaten. '
Therefore, the B.A.C. saved a lot
of money (I wouldn't hazard a guess
as to how much), and now they re
fuse to supply the team with jackets
(just jackets) for the U.S.C. jaunt,
May 4.

THE TRACKMEN CAN'T see
why the B.A.C. can figure on buying
new equipment for Coach Clark
Shnughnessy when they got a new
stock last fall for Tiny Thornhill.
01 course, Mr. Shaughnessy gave his
reasons why — that the footballers
could be tackled easier with the type
ol pants they used then—those silver
beauties.
So the Board can buy new foot
hall unies, hut 115 or 40 Stanford

s I cindermen can't have jackets— at
f 1 about $(> per—just because they
I haven't got any money.
s j And so the boys out there whe
■ 1 have worked from 4 to 6 o'clock
about every day since autumn quar
ter can buy their jackets if thej
' want 'em bad enough — and thej
• probably will.

THE CONCENSUS of opinior
j after Coach Shaughnessy's three
quarter? of an hour get-acquaintec
talk to 105 would-be gridders Wed
nesday was that he's going "to get
j results this spring—and next fall
too.
After a talk like the one he gave,
I even us listcners-in couldn't help
get a tingle out of the way he
! talked about getting down to busi
ness—no favorites . . . 110 fool
ing around . . . 110 monkey busi
i ncss . . . promptness . . . hard
work . . . coining on the run when
J called, etc.
I 11 must have shocked some of the
boys who didn't work for Coach
Thornhill last fall, but my guess is
that these boys will be the ones
who'll work the hardest for Coach
Shaughnessy.
Spring practice should be inter
esting because the coach and his
assistants assure the would-be
footballers that it'll he a hit of
fun as well as hard work.
WE DON'T LIKE the nicknames
j that all but one of the Bay city pa
pers have tacked onto Coach
Shaughnessy. You know what they
! are and who says 'em, so we won't
repeat.
This column and The Daily
sports scribes will call the coach
I either Coach Shaughnessy or Mr.
Shaughnessy. It'll never he just
Shaughnessy.
As far as headline writing is con-
I cerned, it looks as if we're going to
! have to use "Clark" on one-column
I heads, but it'll be "Shaughnessy" on
two-column ones.
And if we're not wrong Coach
Shaughnessy will make enough
news for us from now on in that
we won't have to use the single
column head. We hope we're
right.
