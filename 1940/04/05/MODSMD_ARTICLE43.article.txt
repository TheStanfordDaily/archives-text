# Farm Baseballers to Tangle With Gaddinimen Saturday
## 
### 
Not content with a tough three-game schedule for next week, the
Stanford diamondmen take on the Gaddini All Stars at 3:15 o'clock Sat
urday afternoon in the Sunken Diamond.
This will be the Indians' fourth contest with the Gaddinimen, and they
go into the fray on even terms with their opponents, each team having

won one game while the other game
was "called" with the score tied.
Coach Harry Wolter indicated that
he would use all of his top three
moundsmen in the game, probably
starting "Cootie" Thompson, who
will be relieved by Claude Purkitt
and Bill Masters.
PROBLEM UNSOLVED
The big problem on the Card nine
still hasn't been solved: a good right
fielder who can whack the pellet
still hasn't shown up. Wolter, who
is more conscious of the difficulty
than anyone else, has not decided
who will start in that position Sat
urday.
The rest of the starting line-up
will probably remain unchanged,
with Herb Atkinson behind the
plate, Hal Costello on first, Harry
Parsons at the keystone sack, Monte
Pfyl at short, Elton Boone at the
"hot corner," Norm Juney in left
field, and Alec Cereghino in center
field.
BUSY TEAM
Wolter, an advocate of hard work
and plenty of it, figures that the
Gaddini game will help his boys get
ready for their tough schedule next
week when they take on Ucla, Santa
Clara, and Cal in succession.
With the U.C.L.A. game on Mon

day, the Cards will start their drive
to get out of the conference cellar
in the baseball standings.
