# Winged ‘O’ Cindermen Favored over Indians; Hayes Unable to Start
## Former Indian Stars Holster Winged O Team 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Manned mainly by former Stan
ford stars, Coach Charlie Hunter's
brilliant array of Olympic Club
tracksters tomorrow invade Angell
Field to meet Stanford's blossoming
cindermen. Ihe javelin throw will
begin at 1:45 and the lirst running
event on the program will be the
mile run, starting promptly at 2
o'clock.
Coach Bill Ellington and his crew
face what may turn out to be their
toughest test of the season. Minus
the services of Sid Hayes, the best
collegiate hurdler on the Coast, who
was counted on for 8 or 10 points
against Olympic Club, Stanford's
chances of whipping the great ag
gregation of stars are slim.
CLI MIEN PICKED
'Ihe Daily's dope sheet tabbed the
Winged "O" as the winner with 71
points to the Cards' GO, and other
predictions have favored the "old
men" over the collegians by even
greater scores. Yet if Ellington
chooses to double up in some events,
he can make it mighty hot for the
favorites.
And if the Olympians do beat the
Indians, it will be largely because of
the points taken by former Stanford
stars who have turned on their "alma
mater." In the sprints there will be
tiny Ray Dean, a former Stanford
captain, who will probably get a
second in the hundred and possibly
in the 220.
McCURDY TO RUN
Another former Farm track cap
tain, Bill McCurdy, will carry the
Olympic Club's colors in the middle
distances. All three places in the
discus may go to former Stanford
men performing for the Club: Pete
Zagar, Phil Fox and Jack King.
Humbert Smith in the high jump,
Bud Deacon in the pole vault, John
ny Mot tram in the javelin, and Bill
Wohle in the shot will all be ex-
Stanfordites taking points away from
their old school.
HAYES SICK
Hayes will be unable to compete
because of a bad cold and his ab
sence will rob the meet of its two
most exciting races. For Sid s flight
of high hurdles against Clubmen
Tom Moore and Jim Humphreys and
his flight of lows against Earl Vick
ery and Moore promised to be a
pair of thrillers.
Dean may be able to push Captain
Clyde Jeffrey to a mighty fast time
in the hundred but Clyde's long
legs should help him win easily over
the Club's sprinter in the 220.
SPEEDY 440 MEN
Those three crack Indian quarter
milers, Ernie Clark, Craig William
son, and Charlie Shaw, may chase
each other home in close to 47 sec
onds flat in another close one.
In the longer races it all depends
upon the condition of Olympic Club's
old-timers as to whether or not they
will iivc up to the predictions. None
of the Clubmen in the best of con
dition, however, would be able to
give Paid Moore in the half-mile or
Mush Girard in the mile any argu
ment, but conditioning will count
for a few precious second- and third
place points.
( LIU SWEEPS FIELD
The greatest source of Olympic
Club's points should come from the
field events' where they threaten
clean sweeps in the discus, javelin,
pole vault, and high jump. The
Cards, with Stan Andersen and Ray
Brown, should sneak in for wins in
tho shot put and broad jump re
spectively.
Losing to Olympic Club won't have
the bitter sting that dropping a meet
to Cal or U.S.C. would have; and
regardless of the results, tomorrow's
meet will give Bill Ellington's boys
a lot of experience and competition
and the track fans some close races
and good performances.
