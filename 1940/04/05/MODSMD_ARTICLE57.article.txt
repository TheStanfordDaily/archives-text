## FRANK GUTHRIE. Sports Editor Farm Gridders Start Spring Training Today Shaughnessy to Drill 90 in Fundamentals; 'Field Dayâ€™ Planned 
### 
Practice will begin in earnest this
afternoon for some 90 candidates for
next fall's Stanford varsity. Coach
Clark Shaughnessy and his six as
iistants will launch the spring prac
tice season at 3:45 o'clock this af
ternoon on the lrosh field.
The first three drills will be de
voted entirely to fundamentals and
conditioning, with no heavy work
scheduled until late next week. The
squad got their first inkling of the
brand of football they'll bo play
ing next fall at a chalk talk yester
day afternoon.
PRACTICE DAYS
Drills will be held three times a
week, on Tuesdays, Wednesdays,
and Fridays, for the rest of thjs
month. Blackboard drills will be
aeld on Mondays and Thursdays.
The new Indian coach plans to
hold several secret sessions during
the course of spring practice. Nei
ther students nor the press will be
admitted to these workouts.
BETTER CONCENTRA'I lON
Shaughnessy's idea is that the
players will be able to concentrate
on their work better if there are no
outsiders on the field.
Marchy Schwartz, new back Held
coach, will be in charge of the ''First
Annual Stanford Football Field Day"
slated to replace the spring game as
the climax of the training season.
The program for this event will be
made up of contests in fundamentals
open to all members of the squad.
Snow cover in the Sierras is above
normal at high elevations this
spring.
