AINTREE, Eng., April 4 (UP).
At least 30 jumping horses arc ex-
J pected to start tomorrow down the
four-mile and 856-yard Aintree
i course in a wide-open race for the
$25,000 purse of the 102 nd Grand
National Steeplechase — tho most
| gruelling turf contes' in the world.
For the one day the government
has lifted its ban on war-time gath
i erings, more than half a million Eng
lishmen will crowd the spacious
grandstands and the triangular track
for a glimpse of the 10-minute chase
while 300 A.P.P. wardens, members
of the ambulance corps, and nurses
| patrol the grounds to assist their
| countrymen in the event of an air
raid.
Visitors streamed into Liverpool
■ and Aintree from London by the
I thousands tonight to find the gov
| ernment has taken the most clabo
j rate precaution's against a possible
I r;jid. Sirens have been fitted up on
! every corner of the course and huge
placards have been posted on the
i grandstands giving details of what
1 to do if enemy planes are sighted.
T ; ie favorites were topped by Mrs.
Dorothy Paget's Kilstar, who fluc
tuated around 7-2 as a heavy choice
| to lead all the others home over the
I 30 hazardous jumps which stud the
! gleaming green strip of turf.
