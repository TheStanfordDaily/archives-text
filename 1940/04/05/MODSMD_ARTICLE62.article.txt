NO one who heard Herbert Hoover in his
most interesting appearance yesterday has
anything but praise for the ex-President's ex
cellent presentation of an hour of questions and
answers.
The only irate group is that swarming mass
ol students, numbering from an estimated five
hundred to over two thousand, who were po
litely but firmly informed outside the portals
of Memorial Hall that the inner shell was full
to the peep holes in the roof. Even the boxes
where the stooges revel during the Gaieties
shows and the orchestra pit were flooded.
It's bad enough to live on the same campus
with Mr. Hoover for four years without seeing
him; it's worse to finally get such a chance and
then have to miss it simply because a Demo
cratic professor on the other side of the Quad
refused to dismiss his class early.
The only natural soothing salve for those
turned away has been a torrid criticism of the
townsfolk of Palo Alto and vicinity for having
the audacity to sit in a seat on which the aver
age student feels he has a nine-month option
by virtue of having planked down a cool three
hundred and forty-five pieces of folding money
for the privilege.
But those in charge—the Committee on Pub
lic Exercises and the ushering crew—insist that
there were no more than fifty spectators out
side of students and faculty sitting in those
seats, some of which had not been dusted off
since the above-mentioned Gaieties sold the
place out last fall.
The doors were not opened until very shortly
before 10 o'clock and the student rush. No
doddering Palo Altan had a chance once the
campus horde began their quiet but surging
stampede for vantage points. There are a flock
of Democrats in Paly anyway.
The real cause of friction is a simple matter
of arithmetic. Four does not go into two, except
in halves. Most of Stanford's four thousand
syllabus payers are nominally entities instead
of fragments. And except for the stooge boxes
and similar spots, Memorial Hall does not have
breathing walls.
The presentation of student body cards, as
suggested by some of the rain-check holders,
would have created a situation that could only
have caused unreasonable delay. The Commit
tee did a fairly successful job in keeping out
as many townsfolk as it did.
Someone might present Stanford with a mil
lion-dollar grant to build a "Hall-for-Living-Ex-
Presidents-and-Wives-of-Same," seating 4,500,
and the local housing problem would be solved
post-haste.
The only other idea worth mentioning is to
have our illustrious speakers put on two shows,
as Fred Allen does for the East and West coasts.

refused to dismiss his class early.
The only natural soothing salve for those
turned away has been a torrid criticism of the
townsfolk of Palo Alto and vicinity for having
the audacity to sit in a seat on which the aver
age student feels he has a nine-month option
by virtue of having planked down a cool three
hundred and forty-five pieces of folding money
for the privilege.
But those in charge—the Committee on Pub
lic Exercises and the ushering crew—insist that
there were no more than fifty spectators out
side of students and faculty sitting in those
seats, some of which had not been dusted off
since the above-mentioned Gaieties sold the
place out last fall.
The doors were not opened until very shortly
before 10 o'clock and the student rush. No
doddering Palo Altan had a chance once the
campus horde began their quiet but surging
stampede for vantage points. There are a flock
of Democrats in Paly anyway.
The real cause of friction is a simple matter
of arithmetic. Four does not go into two, except
in halves. Most of Stanford's four thousand
syllabus payers are nominally entities instead
of fragments. And except for the stooge boxes
and similar spots, Memorial Hall does not have
breathing walls.
The presentation of student body cards, as
suggested by some of the rain-check holders,
would have created a situation that could only
have caused unreasonable delay. The Commit
tee did a fairly successful job in keeping out
as many townsfolk as it did.
Someone might present Stanford with a mil
lion-dollar grant to build a "Hall-for-Living-Ex-
Presidents-and-Wives-of-Same," seating 4,500,
and the local housing problem would be solved
post-haste.
The only other idea worth mentioning is to
have our illustrious speakers put on two shows,
as Fred Allen does for the East and West coasts.
NO one who heard Herbert Hoover in his
most interesting appearance yesterday has
anything but praise for the ex-President's ex
cellent presentation of an hour of questions and
answers.
The only irate group is that swarming mass
ol students, numbering from an estimated five
hundred to over two thousand, who were po
litely but firmly informed outside the portals
of Memorial Hall that the inner shell was full
to the peep holes in the roof. Even the boxes
where the stooges revel during the Gaieties
shows and the orchestra pit were flooded.
It's bad enough to live on the same campus
with Mr. Hoover for four years without seeing
him; it's worse to finally get such a chance and
then have to miss it simply because a Demo
cratic professor on the other side of the Quad
refused to dismiss his class early.
