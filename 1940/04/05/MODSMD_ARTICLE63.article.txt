THE spring quarter athletic season opens with
a bang this week-end when Roy Vitousek
attempts to break the world record in the 50-
yard breast stroke. But this is just one of nine
athletic contests which will take place upon the
Farm.
Most of the campus, however, instead of
going to such places as the Sunken Diamond,
the Encina Pools, or the golf course will hie it
self off to the City, or the hills, or the foggy
beach because they suffer under the delusion
that greener pastures are always on the other
side of the fence.
Perhaps if those with the wanderlust or the
itching shoes were to stay on campus for a
week-end and look around they would find that
there are spots in their own yard that are green
—not because of them but because of some
one else.—G. H.
