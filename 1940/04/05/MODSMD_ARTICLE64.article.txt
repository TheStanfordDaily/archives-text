r pIE EDITOK. SIR:
Apparently the campaign, inspired by the admin
istration and encouraged by certain student elements,
for forcing fraternities on the Stanford Campus to ac
cept housemothers is well under way. The administra
tion states that this would improve the grades and con
duct of fraternities, as well as imparting a more home
like atmosphere to those "dens of iniquity" on the
Farm.
Is such the case, however? The grade average of
all fraternities is, and has been, virtually identical with

that of the vaunted Halls of Stanford. Admittedly
some fraternities drop at times below this average, but
to pick single cases is absurd reasoning. I could easily
pick a corridor of one of the halls with a low grade
average and loudly proclaim, "House-mothers for the
Halls," but my reasoning has not, 1 hope, as yet sunk
to such levels of asininity.
The crux of the problem is not grades, however,
but conduct. Does the administration, who so long
have attributed the misconduct of students to imma
turity, in other words, to lack of sound experience in
the affairs of the world, believe that this immaturity
can l>e corrected by keeping the students under the
brooding care of a house-mother? Maturity cannot be
attained tied to a woman's apron strings. The reputa
tion that Stanford has has been derived from the men
it has turned out, the men for whom Stanford has
been the transition from home to world, from boy
hood to manhood. To prevent this transition, to ren
der Stanford a mere continuation of a home rather
than a training field for the problems that must be
faced in the world, would perhaps result in more im
proved conduct here at Stanford, but would scarcely
turn out men.
Such a course would negate the most valuable
thing th/'t Stanford or any other college can offer its
students, the ability and the experience to take their
place in the world. The men and women who spend
their years at Stanford would go forth with nothing
more than small bits of abstract knowledge, as yet
unmodified to practical use, into a world which they
would not be adjusted to. There they would make the
same foolish mistakes they now make here, but with
far more serious consequences. Instead of a Univer
sity, Stanford would be a glorified high school, not
even then affording that modicum of priceless expe
rience that the average high school Rives its students.

their years at Stanford would go forth with nothing
more than small bits of abstract knowledge, as yet
unmodified to practical use, into a world which they
would not be adjusted to. There they would make the
same foolish mistakes they now make here, but with
far more serious consequences. Instead of a Univer
sity, Stanford would be a glorified high school, not
even then affording that modicum of priceless expe
rience that the average high school Rives its students.

Apparently the campaign, inspired by the admin
istration and encouraged by certain student elements,
for forcing fraternities on the Stanford Campus to ac
cept housemothers is well under way. The administra
tion states that this would improve the grades and con
duct of fraternities, as well as imparting a more home
like atmosphere to those "dens of iniquity" on the
Farm.
Is such the case, however? The grade average of
all fraternities is, and has been, virtually identical with

that of the vaunted Halls of Stanford. Admittedly
some fraternities drop at times below this average, but
to pick single cases is absurd reasoning. I could easily
pick a corridor of one of the halls with a low grade
average and loudly proclaim, "House-mothers for the
Halls," but my reasoning has not, 1 hope, as yet sunk
to such levels of asininity.
The crux of the problem is not grades, however,
but conduct. Does the administration, who so long
have attributed the misconduct of students to imma
turity, in other words, to lack of sound experience in
the affairs of the world, believe that this immaturity
can l>e corrected by keeping the students under the
brooding care of a house-mother? Maturity cannot be
attained tied to a woman's apron strings. The reputa
tion that Stanford has has been derived from the men
it has turned out, the men for whom Stanford has
been the transition from home to world, from boy
hood to manhood. To prevent this transition, to ren
der Stanford a mere continuation of a home rather
than a training field for the problems that must be
faced in the world, would perhaps result in more im
proved conduct here at Stanford, but would scarcely
turn out men.
Such a course would negate the most valuable
thing th/'t Stanford or any other college can offer its
students, the ability and the experience to take their
place in the world. The men and women who spend
their years at Stanford would go forth with nothing
more than small bits of abstract knowledge, as yet
unmodified to practical use, into a world which they
would not be adjusted to. There they would make the
same foolish mistakes they now make here, but with
