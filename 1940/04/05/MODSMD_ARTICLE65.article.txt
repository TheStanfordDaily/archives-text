### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
SHADES OF THE SOUTH
jV'EW ORLEANS, La. —We had just bought some ran
cid sandwiches from the vendor on the train and
we started to sit down. The conductor approached us
with a confidential air and whispered, "We can't let
you boys sit here; this is the nigger car."
We knew, but we had forgotten. The sign on the
coach read, "Under the laws of Texas and Louisiana
failure to make provision for transportation of per
sons of the negro and white race in different and sepa
rate compartments shall constitute a misdemeanor
which is punishable by a fine of not less than $100."
The sign typifies the prevailing attitude of the
South: We don't want to hurt the niggers, but they
must be kept in their place. Train conductors, college
students and intelligent business men give the same
answer.
The sharp law-enforced division between negroes
and whites was a little strange to us. Southerners
know that. But northerners don't understand, they
say, because the North doesn't have the same prob
lem. The Negro population in the South is almost 50
per cent in some states. Starting with this premise
and proceeding on the assumption that Negroes are
an inferior race, intelligent Southerners argue ra
tional terms —with a slightly indignant expression half
suppressed on their faces. I don't think they like the
idea of Northerners "telling them what to do."

AND in justice to the intelligence of the South it
must be admitted that great, masses of ignorant
Negroes might fundamentally change the views of a
Northerner on the Jim Crow Laws. But the proximity
of so many illiterate Negroes in the South has unques
tionably raised a white prejudice that hurts most of
all the intelligent Negro. His chances of living up to
his ability are often thrown in the same lot with those
black thugs on Basin Street.
But all the shades of this problem are not dark.
The states do provide well-built universities for col
ored students. And our train conductor in New Or
leans made a statement which would probably shock
Stanford's great psychologist, Dr. Terman, who thinks
I.Q.'s do not change. "Yes," said the conductor, "these
niggers have gotten a bit more intelligent in the last
ten years."
Education may offer a partial solution. But for the
present the attitude of the South on Negroes doesn't
invite a personal argument—in the South. We were
a little worried when Ed McGah, an Oakland baseball
player on our train, candidly asked one of New Or
leans' leading citizens, "Say, aren't you folks a little
prejudiced against colored people down here?"
Fortunately, the dignified old gentleman was
slightly deaf.
