It was in Madrono, I believe, that the boys walked
in and saw the two girls asleep, lying there on their
stomachs. Each girl had an open book lying face down
across what has been called her fanny.
The boys wanted, and got, an explanation:
The girls had been taking a course in psychology;
or it might have been Yogiism. It's hard to say. At
any rate, they had read—and believed—the theory
that knowledge can be absorbed through the body
while you are asleep.
Now I got this story from one of the guys who
interrupted these girls in their unique and rather
Utopian way of studying. He had an honest face. He
and I believe the story.
But I am rather curious about the reason for the
particular placing of the books.
