# DARK HORSE

### 
In a small and very select poll I asked a few from
Roble what was keeping Roble happy these days, and
they said, "Encina." Then I asked a few of the frosh
from Encina what was keeping that joint happy these
days and they said, believe it or not. "Roble."
And a small delegation from Gamma Phi said, "Is
that so?"
