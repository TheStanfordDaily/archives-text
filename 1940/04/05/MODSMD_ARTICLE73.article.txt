# Fields' Antics In "Chickadee" Rate Bouquets
## 
### 
"MY LITTLE CHICKADEE," with
W. C. Fields and Mae West, now
playing at the Stanford Theater.
There are a certain number of
people to whom the Fieldian style of
humor is one of the funniest on the
screen. Then there are tho.se to
whom the rotund comic apppcars
exceedingly obnoxious.
This reviewer, being one of the
former and therefore blessed with
debatable mentality, will toss ran
dom bouquets to the inimitable
"W.C." for his antics in "My Little
Chickadee." Of course there is an
other character whose Bowery ac
cent, peroxide hair, and motile hips
make her rather impossible to miss
WEST TYPED
Thoroughly typed, Miss West's
characterizations have, through the
activities of (he riays office and also
time, lost much of their flavor since
the days of "1 m No Angel."
However, Fields definitely carries
Ihe show with his witty cracks, both
old and new, and his never-ending
line of egotistical chatter.
Despite the fact that there Ls prac
tically a complete absence of co
herent plot, the thing is still funny.
Mae West portrays a woman of you
know-what repute who handles a
six-shooter as easily as a fingernail
polisher.
For a carpetbag full of liver-pill
-ids which look like century notes
she marries Fields; only the mar
riage is a fake. Cuthbert Twillie
(Fields) later senses a "Übangi in
•he fuel supply." Complications are
furnished by a masked bandit, the
town boss, a righteous editor, and
Fields' becoming the sheriff
SCENE IS WEST
Incidentally the whole think takes
place somewhere in the wild and
woolly West of the 1880's or there
abouts.
Margaret Hamilton of wicked witch
fame in the "Wizard of Oz" plays a
similar part well, the town gossip
and undoubtedly chairman of the
temperance union and women's up
lift society. Other supporting roles
are handled by Joseph Callcia, Dick
Foran. and Donald Meek.
The rest of the program is taken
up by Warren William, Joan Perry,
some thugs, and some cops dillying
around with a stolen pearl necklace,
plus a phony duplicate, of course, in
"The Lone Wolf Strikes."—Bull

"The Lone Wolf Strikes."—Bull
"MY LITTLE CHICKADEE," with
W. C. Fields and Mae West, now
playing at the Stanford Theater.
There are a certain number of
people to whom the Fieldian style of
humor is one of the funniest on the
screen. Then there are tho.se to
whom the rotund comic apppcars
exceedingly obnoxious.
This reviewer, being one of the
former and therefore blessed with
debatable mentality, will toss ran
dom bouquets to the inimitable
"W.C." for his antics in "My Little
Chickadee." Of course there is an
other character whose Bowery ac
cent, peroxide hair, and motile hips
make her rather impossible to miss
WEST TYPED
Thoroughly typed, Miss West's
characterizations have, through the
activities of (he riays office and also
time, lost much of their flavor since
the days of "1 m No Angel."
However, Fields definitely carries
Ihe show with his witty cracks, both
old and new, and his never-ending
line of egotistical chatter.
Despite the fact that there Ls prac
tically a complete absence of co
herent plot, the thing is still funny.
Mae West portrays a woman of you
know-what repute who handles a
six-shooter as easily as a fingernail
polisher.
For a carpetbag full of liver-pill
-ids which look like century notes
she marries Fields; only the mar
riage is a fake. Cuthbert Twillie
(Fields) later senses a "Übangi in
•he fuel supply." Complications are
furnished by a masked bandit, the
town boss, a righteous editor, and
Fields' becoming the sheriff
SCENE IS WEST
Incidentally the whole think takes
place somewhere in the wild and
woolly West of the 1880's or there
abouts.
Margaret Hamilton of wicked witch
fame in the "Wizard of Oz" plays a
similar part well, the town gossip
and undoubtedly chairman of the
temperance union and women's up
lift society. Other supporting roles
are handled by Joseph Callcia, Dick
Foran. and Donald Meek.
The rest of the program is taken
up by Warren William, Joan Perry,
some thugs, and some cops dillying
around with a stolen pearl necklace,
plus a phony duplicate, of course, in
