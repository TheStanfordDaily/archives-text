### WILSON CANNON 
IJURING the past 16 years So
cialist party presidential hopes
have fallen three times with Norman
Thomas as their candidate for the
highest post that America can offer.
Yesterday the Socialists met in
Washington. For the fourth time in
as many presidential years Thomas
headed their slate. And for the
fourth time Socialist hopes will fall
again with Thomas.
And for the fourth time Socialist
hopes will fall again with Thomas.
No one concedes him a chance.
Except a few scattered party
members. Even most of these
will grant that his best bet is
third place . . . especially if no
fourth party enters the presi- '
dential ring.
But Socialist party whips did not
need to urge on the crowd of 250
delegates that whooped and hol
lered when Thomas was nominated.
They cheered him for fully three
minutes.
The 55-year-old hardy perennial
was unopposed at the Socialist
caucus. His running mate, May
nard C. Krueger, also went through
the caucus with no competition.
The caucus vote lines up a former
Presbyterian minister of New York,
Thomas, with a professor of eco
nomics, Kreuger. Socialist politicians
like the cap and gown combination.
Party platform was not fixed at
yesterday's meeting. But the group
did vote 159-28 against a proposal
that the United States should give
economic aid tp the Allies.

indication that if Thom
as rides through the November elec
tion America will oppose any aid
Ihrough World War II was evident
at the meeting. The Socialists went
on record as favoring a program in
opposition to war, and especially
denounced foreign dictatorships.
So the next four years may
find America an isolationist na
tion. All Thomas has to do is win
the presidency come next No
vember.
But Thomas himself seemed to
feel that his chances are merely a
shot in the dark.
Previously, the 55-year-old cam
paigner had resolved not. to run. But
he accepted yesterday's nomination
because "for the Socialist party to
run no ticket" be backing
down under the fire of present na
tional and international conditions.

IN ACCEPTING the nomination he
said that he would have preferred
an alignment between the Socialists
and some larger group . . . either
the Republicans or the Democrats.
He also indicated that little hope
remained that one of these two
parties would accept the Socialist
program, and said that now his hat
was in the ring he would fight no
matter what either of the other two
parties did in their conventions.
"We fight because we know pov
erty can be conquered in this great
land," he said in his specch of ac
ceptance. "But this can be done
Thomas' subtle inference that he
only through a positive program."
realizes his chances are slim ran
through the entii'e meeting, despite
brave flag-waving and the promise
of a platform of platforms.
Hut, their platform, which will
appear at an early date, won't
show any weaknesses. Neither will
any of their publicity. And neither
will Norman Thomas, now that he
is definitely planning to run.
Nevertheless, the Socialists, as
well as those who watch their do
ings every year because it is an in
teresting sideshow, know that the
cause, at least for 1940, is a losing
one.
But there is one lesson which
Ihese Socialists could teach their
older brothers in the political field.
They haven't, for four presidential
years, been forced to build up their
candidate from a field of promising
runners-up. One man has been
their political entity for 16 years.
But they'll never have to worry
over a third-term question.
Liquor drinking motorists and
pedestrians in California figured in
594 fatal accident cases in 1939.
