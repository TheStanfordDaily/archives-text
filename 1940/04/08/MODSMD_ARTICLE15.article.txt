# School of Education Sponsors Reading Improvement Class

### JANET GOULD 
Teaching Stanford's dyed-in-the-wool gilt-edged I.Q.'s how to read—
that's the job of John H. CornehLscn, Jr., late of St. Lawrence University
and now conducting the spring quarter reading center in the School of
Education.
The course, Reading I, listed in last year's Announcement of Courses

'as Psychology R, undertakes to in
crease the average student's reading
and comprehension capabilities with
the help of instruction in tech
niques, a smattering of social serv
ice, and the help of three large,
black, efficient machines.
All this for one unit and an eight
dollar fee. Registration for the
course is still open.

In order to cope with the 30 stu
dents who are permitted to register
for the course, Mr. Cornehlsen, who
looks more like an ex-college ath
lete in business than a psychologist
and educator, uses records from the
dean's offices, health departments,
aptitude tests—all the personal data
on each student —and is assisted by
a staff of students and half a dozen
special reading tests.
The laboratory machines are the
junior metronoscope, ophthalmo
graph, and Keystone telebinocular.
The first gives the student a con
cept of pacing and rhythmic control
as he reads a line. The ophthalmo
graph photographs eye movements,
records the jerks and stops—called
fixations in the education business —
to record any deviation from the
usual 80 fixations per 100 words. The
telebinocular is a device for testing
eyesight, although, Mr. Cornehlsen
said carefully, the department can
not take responsibility for medical
diagnosis.

' The importance of proper read
ing habits is being stressed all over
the country, although it is a fairly
recent development in education,"
he continued. "But if you consider
that upon entering college the
amount of reading you must do is
about 15 times as much as what you
were required to do before—well,
something has to be done about it.
It's just a question of increasing ef
ficiency," he said. "Nothing far
fetched."'
A considerable number of under
graduates who have trouble with
reading and study are now well ad
justed to the various aspects of col
lege life, he Jtkled. Therefore, a
great deal of the work is orientation.

"Not that this course clears the
way for future life,'' he grinned.
The students themselves endorse
the center. Over 30 per cent of old
students questioned were helped;
even one straight B man had his
capacity per hour raised from lfi to
32 pages of the average textbook.
Approximately 63 per cent under
stand their material better for hav
ing taken the course, and over ihree
quarters recommend it. uncondition

One graduate remarked that the
center is not a clinic for dumbbells.
Another student recommends it be
cause "it has brought back to me
self-confidence I had lost because
of discouraging realities. I learned to
read words not as mere words but
as ideas." Still another acquired a
desire to read more than he did be
fore. while a fourth was impressed
with his new ability to skim, an
nounced an intention to keep up the
use of the metronoscope during the
coming quarter.

In order to cope with the 30 stu
dents who are permitted to register
for the course, Mr. Cornehlsen, who
looks more like an ex-college ath
lete in business than a psychologist
and educator, uses records from the
dean's offices, health departments,
aptitude tests—all the personal data
on each student —and is assisted by
a staff of students and half a dozen
special reading tests.
The laboratory machines are the
junior metronoscope, ophthalmo
graph, and Keystone telebinocular.
The first gives the student a con
cept of pacing and rhythmic control
as he reads a line. The ophthalmo
graph photographs eye movements,
records the jerks and stops—called
fixations in the education business —
to record any deviation from the
usual 80 fixations per 100 words. The
telebinocular is a device for testing
eyesight, although, Mr. Cornehlsen
said carefully, the department can
not take responsibility for medical
diagnosis.
