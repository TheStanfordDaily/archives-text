# U-Boat Sinks Neutral Ship As 12 Drown
## Norwegian Goes Down As She Carries Coal From Britain to Oslo 
### 
LONDON, April 7 (UP).â€”Pres
sure against Sweden and Norway
in the intensified war of blockade
was aggravated today with an
nouncement that a German U-boat
had torpedoed and sunk the 2,118-
ton Norwegian ship Navarra in
storm-lashed Scottish waters with
a loss of 12 lives.
The Navarra, carrying a cargo of
coal from Swansea up around the
tip of Scotland to Oslo, went down
at 2:30 a.m. Saturday about 30 miles
from the coast of Scotland. Fourteen
survivors suffering from exposure
and injuries were rescued after nine
hours in a lifeboat.
STRESS NEUTRAL RIGHTS
The loss of the Navarra occurred
shortly before Norway's Premier and
Foreign Minister made speeches in
Oslo insisting on respect for trade
rights and warning that any one
sided interference might "immedi
ately involve Norway in war."
Sinking of the Navarra brought
the sea warfare losses of neutral
Norway to 55 ships totaling 122,000
tons and the lives of 404 sailors and
passengers.
PROPAGANDISTS DISAGREE
British naval quarters asserted
that on February 21 Vice-Admiral
Schneiwidt, chief of the German
naval staff, promised the Norwegian
Shipowners' Association that "Nor
wegian vessels voyaging from Britain
with coal or similar cargoes will not
be attacked by German naval forces
unless convoyed, but they may be
examined."
British naval authorities said the
Navarra was not traveling in a
British convoy when attacked but
was well lighted and her identity
was painted in large letters on
both sides.
(The Scandinavian wireless re
ported from Oslo that it was "un
derstood'' that the Navarra was
torpedoed while traveling in a
British naval convoy.)
