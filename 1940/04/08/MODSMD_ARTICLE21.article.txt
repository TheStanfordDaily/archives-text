# Row Jitters Heightened As Jessup Enters Race For A.S.S.U. Presidency
## Alltucker Still Best Bet for Halls As Politicos Reiterate Mellinkoff's Desire to Steer Clear of Elections 
### ROWAN HALL 
Row politique jitters heightened over the week-end when Bruce Jes
sup. Beta Theta Pis favorite son, entered the crowded A.S.S.U. presidency
race already spoken for by Grayson Bryan, Phi Psi; Art Gore, Phi Delt;
Ned Pugh, Delta Chi; and Boh Newell, S.A.E.
Down in the Halls the Sherman McllinkofT question seemed a closed

book when friends of the junior
class prexy again asserted that The
Daily Bull Sessioner would not mix
medicine and politics next year.
Lanky John Alltucker is still pic
tured as the Hall's candidate for the
top spot next year.
NOMINATIONS TOMORROW
Nominations for a successor to
Ken Cuthbertson open tomorrow
and iclose Wednesday. Election

Bo'ard Chairman Bill Leckie an
nounced last night that petition
slips, requiring 15 names, would be
available at the regular polls from
8 to 6 o'clock on both days.
Jessup's candidacy, assured yes
terday when Dean Marion Kirk wood
of the Law School disclosed that
Jessup is in no wise ineligible be
cause he is not in school this
quarter. Dean Kirkwood is the
A.S.S.U.'s constitutional interpreter.
Meanwhile, supporters of the
Bryan - Gore - Pugh-Newell quartet
kept phones hot seeking possible
supporting slates for their candi
dates. Disclosure of Jessup's candi
dacy may throw two or more of the
above blocks together for .self
protection.
IDEAL COMPROMISE
Beta brothers of Jessup's believe
that the tall athlete-scholar is an
ideal compromise between now
widely-split factions on the Row.
Upper Row politicians are still
strong for Greyson Bryan, Phi Psj,
but a host of other houses have in
dicated that some middle-of-the
road candidate would have to ap
pear if the Row is to escape splits
such as those which have endan
gered their position in the past two
elections.
The existence of strong Lower-
Row pressure for blond Phi Delt. Art
Gore continued throughout the
week-end to strengthen the need for
a candidate favorable to all factions.
Ned Pugh, the Delta Chi's rugby
and soccer stalwart, Encina sponsor,
head of the Japanese-American stu
dent conference, member of Cardi
nals and Axe Society, pushed his
machine over the week-end in an
attempt to become the dark horse of
the Row caucus. Likewise, Bob
Newell, S.A.E., has given away little
ground in his attempt to become the
acceptable middle - course candi
date.
Feature of the entire Row situa
tion is the present tendency for ap
plicants seeking positions other than
A.S.S.U. presidency to keep clear of
entanglements until the favorite son
appears.
Among strangely silent Hall poli
ticians, some semblance of unity has
appeared since Friday.
