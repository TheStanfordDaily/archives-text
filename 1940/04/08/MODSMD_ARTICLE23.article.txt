THE NEW "STRATO-CUPPER," built for Pan American Airways by Boeing, is shown here reposing
alongside a tiny 411 horsepower, lift-foot Aeronca Trainer. The giant four-engined plane with a wingspread
of 107 feel will carry passengers above the storms in a super-charged cabin at an altitude of 25.000 feet.
