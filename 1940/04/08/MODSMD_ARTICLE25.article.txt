### 
NEW ORLEANS, April 7 (UP).â€”
Death-dealing winds ripped through
Louisiana lor the third time within a
month last night and today, killing
at least five persons and causing
more than $500,000 property damage.
Amite, a strawberry center 69 miles
north of here, was the hardest hit.
The Red Cross established Amite
headquarters in the wind-torn court
house. Only three large structures
in the six-block business section
withstood the storm. St. Helena's
I Catholic Church and a Methodist
church were destroyed. Sixty-five
houses were demolished and 75
others damaged, leaving 400 home
less.
CCC AID SENT
Two CCC camps sent men to clear
debris and search for dead and in
jured. State police were on hand to
guide rescue work and the WPA
announced 50 workers would arrive
at Amite early tomorrow to help in
rehabilitation.
Fourteen guests at the McMichael
Hotel in Amite narrowly escaped in
jury. The hotel roof blew away and
windows were shattered by the twis
ter, which left no other two-story
structures in the block standing.
PLASTER CAVES IN
"The windows of our room caved
in," a guest said. "Then the plaster
from the ceiling fell in. That's when
we got out of there. Holes already
I had appeared in the second floor and
just as we got out, the roof went off."
Three weeks ago, on March 12,
12 persons were killed and $2,000,000
property damage done when a tor
nado struck Shreveport. On March
29, five persons were killed at the
village of Pierre Part, another was
j killed near Amite, and another near
Bogalusa.
