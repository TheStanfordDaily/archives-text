# Phil Wolf Leads Frosh to Win
## Yearling Nine Takes 7th Victory in Row 
### 
Phil Wolf set San Mateo High
School down with a solitary hit Sat
urday and struck out 16 men in nine
innings as the freshman baseball
team easily grabbed their seventh
win in a row, 11-1.
Wolf, a husky, quiet lad who has
been showing flashes of form all
year, was at practically top form in
picking up his fourth straight tri
umph as against only two defeats.
The San Mateo blow had nothing to
j do with their lone tally. Two walks
| and a single in the third were the
; only times Wolf let an opponent
I reach first except when his mates
! made two errors.
A walk, stolen base, passed ball,
j and an error let in the only run for
j the opponents, but the frosh jumped
' ahead from the start and already
had a 4-1 lead when they burst
forth with seven counters in the
sixth frame. Six errors by the Ma
teans helped the frosh cause.
Left Fielder Carl Kellenberger
slammed three straight singles in
four trips and Third Baseman Ted
Falasco, First Sacker Ray Hammett,
and Wolf all got two blows in four
times up. Hammett and Tommy
Howard, second base, garnered
doubles.
Tomorrow afternoon at 3:30
o'clock, Coach Art Esslinger's men
meet Santa Clara High in their last
preparatory tilt for the Cal Series.
The frosh will go to Berkeley for
the next two Saturdays and the
Cubs will play the third of the series
here April 27.
