# Indian Cindermen Sweep Through Weakened O.C. Squad to Tune of 77-53
## Cards Keep Slate Clean in Beating Vaunted Winged 'O' Team; Simpson Hated 'Come-through Boy' of Meet 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Putting together four or five "best
over" performances, several brilliant
upsets, and the fact that some of
Olympic Club's ex-stars were not
in the best of condition, Coach Bill
Ellington's Stanford tracksters de
feated the Olympic Club 77 11-15 to
53 4-15.
The Winged "O" outfit, potentially
the greatest track team in the coun
try, was minus the services of Cecil
Cole, Jim Humphreys, and Elton
VVeiman. More damaging than this
was the fact that several of the men
they were counting on for winning
points weren't in condition enough
to equal their past performances.
Hay Dean folded after the first 60
yards of the hundred and lasted only
a little longer in the furlong to yield
the Cards a clean sweep in both
splints. Bill MeCurdy wasted the
little breath he had trying to stay
with Ellington's three flying quar
ter-milers and consequently was way
back in the half-mile,
VICKERY WAY BACK
Earl Vickery, former intercolle
giate champion, was four yards back,
in third place, in a flight of low hur
dles in a time which he had once
bettered by more than a full second.
And on the field, Humbert Smith in
the high jump, Bill Fitzpatrick in
the broad jump, and George Varoff
in the pole vault just didn't pay off.
But the meet wasn't won by Stan
ford on the failings of the Winged
"O" stars to perform as was ex
pected. It was won by a really blos
soming Indian track team whose
every member was at his best or
even better.
Charlie Shaw started the "best
ever" performances when he roared
the quarter-mile in 47.4, two-tenths
of a second better than previously.
His running mate, Craig Williamson,
also ran his best race; he was caught
in 47.7. Ken Battaglia certainly sped
through one of his best hundreds
when he stayed within 2>2 yards of
the flying Captain Clyde Jeffrey in
that 9.6 century. Ken didn't yield
a foot to Clyde after the first 50
yards.
SIMPSON STARS
Next came the high hurdles and
the real come-through boy of the
meet. It was Dick Simpson who ran
a 14.6 race, being right at Tom
Moore's shoulder in 14.5. A couple
of events later Dick whipped Moore
;md the formerly great Vickery in
the low hurdles with a best-ever
time of 23.9 for him.
Blair Hyde, aided and abetted by
Paul Moore, turned in the half-mile
in 1:54, a full second's improvement
tor him. And in the discus, big Stan
Andersen, who had already won the
shot put at 52 ft. 3 in., moved his
personal mark out a foot to 154 feet.
"It's been an awful long time since
Stanford has swept the broad jump
against any team," said Bill Elling
ton. But, aided by a surprise win
ner and greatly improved jumper,
Thor Peterson, the Cards did just
this. Thor got out there one-half
inch short of 23 feet, and te.immate
Kay Brown was only an inch behind
him

The best long-distance runner and
good Samaritan of the meet was tire
less Paul Moore. Paul turned into
the straightaway of a 4:16.9 mile run
as fresh as a daisy and slowed up
in an effort to get a tie with Mushy
Girard, but the judges gave the de
cision to Girard.
Likewise in the half mile, Paul ran
a beautiful, apparently effortless
race and' attempted again to get a
tie where he could have won. But
the judges couldn't see the tie and
picked Blair Hyde the winner.
Next Saturday the undefeated
Cards meet a real soft touch, U.C.-
L.A. Though the meet won't be
close, it is bound to be interesting,
for Ellington lias announced hio in
tention to try for that world's record
in the mile relay.

shot put at 52 ft. 3 in., moved his
personal mark out a foot to 154 feet.
"It's been an awful long time since
Stanford has swept the broad jump
against any team," said Bill Elling
ton. But, aided by a surprise win
ner and greatly improved jumper,
Thor Peterson, the Cards did just
this. Thor got out there one-half
inch short of 23 feet, and te.immate
Kay Brown was only an inch behind
him

The best long-distance runner and
good Samaritan of the meet was tire
less Paul Moore. Paul turned into
the straightaway of a 4:16.9 mile run
as fresh as a daisy and slowed up
in an effort to get a tie with Mushy
Girard, but the judges gave the de
cision to Girard.
Likewise in the half mile, Paul ran
a beautiful, apparently effortless
race and' attempted again to get a
tie where he could have won. But
the judges couldn't see the tie and
picked Blair Hyde the winner.
Next Saturday the undefeated
Cards meet a real soft touch, U.C.-
L.A. Though the meet won't be
close, it is bound to be interesting,
for Ellington lias announced hio in
tention to try for that world's record
in the mile relay.
Putting together four or five "best
over" performances, several brilliant
upsets, and the fact that some of
Olympic Club's ex-stars were not
in the best of condition, Coach Bill
Ellington's Stanford tracksters de
feated the Olympic Club 77 11-15 to
53 4-15.
The Winged "O" outfit, potentially
the greatest track team in the coun
try, was minus the services of Cecil
Cole, Jim Humphreys, and Elton
VVeiman. More damaging than this
was the fact that several of the men
they were counting on for winning
points weren't in condition enough
to equal their past performances.
Hay Dean folded after the first 60
yards of the hundred and lasted only
a little longer in the furlong to yield
the Cards a clean sweep in both
splints. Bill MeCurdy wasted the
little breath he had trying to stay
with Ellington's three flying quar
ter-milers and consequently was way
back in the half-mile,
VICKERY WAY BACK
Earl Vickery, former intercolle
giate champion, was four yards back,
in third place, in a flight of low hur
dles in a time which he had once
bettered by more than a full second.
And on the field, Humbert Smith in
the high jump, Bill Fitzpatrick in
the broad jump, and George Varoff
in the pole vault just didn't pay off.
But the meet wasn't won by Stan
ford on the failings of the Winged
"O" stars to perform as was ex
pected. It was won by a really blos
soming Indian track team whose
every member was at his best or
even better.
Charlie Shaw started the "best
ever" performances when he roared
the quarter-mile in 47.4, two-tenths
of a second better than previously.
His running mate, Craig Williamson,
also ran his best race; he was caught
in 47.7. Ken Battaglia certainly sped
through one of his best hundreds
when he stayed within 2>2 yards of
the flying Captain Clyde Jeffrey in
that 9.6 century. Ken didn't yield
a foot to Clyde after the first 50
yards.

Next came the high hurdles and

Moore's shoulder in 14.5. A couple

;md the formerly great Vickery in
the low hurdles with a best-ever
time of 23.9 for him.
Blair Hyde, aided and abetted by

ever" performances when he roared
the quarter-mile in 47.4, two-tenths
of a second better than previously.
His running mate, Craig Williamson,
also ran his best race; he was caught
in 47.7. Ken Battaglia certainly sped
through one of his best hundreds
when he stayed within 2>2 yards of
the flying Captain Clyde Jeffrey in
that 9.6 century. Ken didn't yield
a foot to Clyde after the first 50
yards.
SIMPSON STARS
Next came the high hurdles and
the real come-through boy of the
meet. It was Dick Simpson who ran
a 14.6 race, being right at Tom
Moore's shoulder in 14.5. A couple
of events later Dick whipped Moore
;md the formerly great Vickery in
the low hurdles with a best-ever
time of 23.9 for him.
Blair Hyde, aided and abetted by
Paul Moore, turned in the half-mile
in 1:54, a full second's improvement
tor him. And in the discus, big Stan
Andersen, who had already won the
shot put at 52 ft. 3 in., moved his
personal mark out a foot to 154 feet.
"It's been an awful long time since
Stanford has swept the broad jump
against any team," said Bill Elling
ton. But, aided by a surprise win
ner and greatly improved jumper,
Thor Peterson, the Cards did just
this. Thor got out there one-half
inch short of 23 feet, and te.immate
Kay Brown was only an inch behind
him

The best long-distance runner and
good Samaritan of the meet was tire
less Paul Moore. Paul turned into
the straightaway of a 4:16.9 mile run
as fresh as a daisy and slowed up
in an effort to get a tie with Mushy
Girard, but the judges gave the de
cision to Girard.
Likewise in the half mile, Paul ran
a beautiful, apparently effortless
race and' attempted again to get a
tie where he could have won. But
the judges couldn't see the tie and
picked Blair Hyde the winner.
Next Saturday the undefeated
Cards meet a real soft touch, U.C.-
L.A. Though the meet won't be
close, it is bound to be interesting,
for Ellington lias announced hio in
tention to try for that world's record
in the mile relay.
Putting together four or five "best
over" performances, several brilliant
upsets, and the fact that some of
Olympic Club's ex-stars were not
in the best of condition, Coach Bill
Ellington's Stanford tracksters de
feated the Olympic Club 77 11-15 to
53 4-15.
The Winged "O" outfit, potentially
the greatest track team in the coun
try, was minus the services of Cecil
Cole, Jim Humphreys, and Elton
VVeiman. More damaging than this
was the fact that several of the men
they were counting on for winning
points weren't in condition enough
to equal their past performances.
Hay Dean folded after the first 60
yards of the hundred and lasted only
a little longer in the furlong to yield
the Cards a clean sweep in both
splints. Bill MeCurdy wasted the
little breath he had trying to stay
with Ellington's three flying quar
ter-milers and consequently was way
back in the half-mile,
VICKERY WAY BACK
Earl Vickery, former intercolle
giate champion, was four yards back,
in third place, in a flight of low hur
dles in a time which he had once
bettered by more than a full second.
And on the field, Humbert Smith in
the high jump, Bill Fitzpatrick in
the broad jump, and George Varoff
in the pole vault just didn't pay off.
But the meet wasn't won by Stan
ford on the failings of the Winged
"O" stars to perform as was ex
pected. It was won by a really blos
soming Indian track team whose
every member was at his best or
even better.
