## FRANK GUTHRIE, Sports Editor Card Nine Will Meet Uclans In Deciding Game Today, 3:15 
### 
With Quentin '"Cootie" Thompson, i
the only Indian flinger who has won
a league game this season, on the
mound, Stanford's baseball club ,
takes on U.C.LA. in the Sunken ;
Diamond at 3:15 o'clock this after- !
noon. This will be the third and
deciding game of the Card-Bruin
series, the two teams having split
the first two games played down j
south during spring vacation.
The Uclans, who have already
played four games on their northern
tour, do not present a very impres
sive record, having only won one of
their four games played last week.
They split a double-header with
Cal, winning the first game 5-3 and
losing the night-cap 12-2; next came
a 7-2 defeat from St. Mary's, fol
lowed by a 19-9 shellacking by j
Santa Clara.
The Indian nine, which can boast
of only three league games won this
season, is hoping to use the Bruins
as their first step on the way out of
the cellar of the league standings.
And if the team gives Thompson
good support, the chances of the
Cards doing just that appear very
bright, according (o Coach Harry
Wolter.

Oakland took an early-season lead
in the Pacific Coast League Sunday
with a double-header victory over
San Francisco that gave the Oaks a
6-1 decision on the week's series.
With Quentin '"Cootie" Thompson, i
the only Indian flinger who has won
a league game this season, on the
mound, Stanford's baseball club ,
takes on U.C.LA. in the Sunken ;
Diamond at 3:15 o'clock this after- !
noon. This will be the third and
deciding game of the Card-Bruin
series, the two teams having split
the first two games played down j
south during spring vacation.
The Uclans, who have already
played four games on their northern
tour, do not present a very impres
sive record, having only won one of
their four games played last week.
They split a double-header with
Cal, winning the first game 5-3 and
losing the night-cap 12-2; next came
a 7-2 defeat from St. Mary's, fol
lowed by a 19-9 shellacking by j
Santa Clara.
The Indian nine, which can boast
of only three league games won this
season, is hoping to use the Bruins
as their first step on the way out of
the cellar of the league standings.
And if the team gives Thompson
good support, the chances of the
Cards doing just that appear very
bright, according (o Coach Harry
Wolter.

day's game, the Indians were on the
short end of a 3-2 score, but in that
seventh frame they turned on the
