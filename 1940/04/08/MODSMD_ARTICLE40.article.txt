NEW YORK, April 7 (UP).—The
New York Yankees today were es
tablished the shortest favorites in
history to win the American League
pennant and become the first team
ever to capture five successive
championships. Jack Doyle, who
has been setting the baseball odds
for more than 30 years, quoted the I
Yanks at 7-20—he lays 35 cents
against your dollar.
