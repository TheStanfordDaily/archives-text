# The 						First Lady

### 
THE best-known woman in America will speak
at Stanford tonight. When she walks onto
the stage of Memorial Hall at 8 o'clock, she will
find 1,800 people waiting to hear her views
on "America Faces the Future."
Many of those people who will listen to Mrs.
Roosevelt would attend a lecture by any "bi.g
name" personality. They'd be happy to pay
their money through the ticket window to hear
any headline-spattered speaker.
Because Eleanor Roosevelt is the wife of the
President of the United States, she draws a
crowd anywhere she chooses to appear. Be
cause, too, as first lady of the land she chooses
to carry that title, literally, to every portion of
the country, she has acguired still further men
tion in the nation's press. People disagree more
violently about Mrs. Roosevelt, perhaps, than
they do about any other public figure.
But if those of us in Memorial Hall tonight
overlook the fact that we are face to face with
the President's wife, if we forget to be dazzled
—or, maybe, irate—we should hear a genuinely
important discussion of American problems and
policies. Gracious, sincere, and energetic al
most beyond human comprehension, Eleanor
Roosevelt is as well known to the coal miners
in western Pennsylvania, the migrants of cen
tral California, and the share-croppers of Geor
gia as she is to official Washington.
And, as an intelligent lady, thoughtful, lib
eral, and well informed, she has valuable in
formation for a Stanford audience.
Within five days Memorial Hall will have
been crowded twice—and Stanford will have
gained tremendously in the process.—D. H.
