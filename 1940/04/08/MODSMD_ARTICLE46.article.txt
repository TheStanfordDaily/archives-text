# A 						Problem in Motherhood
## 
### 
TODAY'S Campus Opinion columns give, in
no uncertain terms, a little of the pro and
con of the current house-mother discussion.
Possibly you disagree violently with either
or both of the writers. The intention of The
Daily is merely to show that a problem does
exist. A majority of the houses on the campus
unquestionably lack the feminine touch, but
as one Row man said, "If I had wanted a woman
around, I would have pledged Pi Phi."
Another writer even went so far as to sug
gest house fathers for sororities. After all, may
be they need the masculine touch as much as
the men require womanhood in their lives. A
house father could act concurrently as (a) the
official chaperone and (b) as a house detective.
Without a doubt many of the fraternities on
this campus are ill kept and unreasonably
boisterous. Some member eat their meals out
because the twice-a-day three-ring circus isn't
conducive to the sound functioning of a strug
gling digestive tract.
Down to now the following ideas have been
suggested. Maybe none of these will ever be
adopted. Then again a gradual metamorphosis
may come about. It would seem to be some
thing that the fraternities should work out for
themselves. Take your pick:
1. House mothers, selected through a place
ment bureau.
2. House mothers, selected by the houses
themselves.
3. House fathers.
4. Proctors, being graduate students respon
sible to the houses' alumni boards and to a
committee of house officers. This plan has defi
nite advantages and is a threatening rebuttal
to those who do not like the ruffle of middle
aged petticoats.
Interfraternity Council could do no harm in
investigating a few of the possibilities.
