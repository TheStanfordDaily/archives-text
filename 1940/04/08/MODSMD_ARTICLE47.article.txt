r rilE EDITOR, SIR:
In a recent Daily I notice that Dean Bunn sug
gests housemothers for the fraternities. The reason
he gives was quoted a.s follows:
"Her presence and influence would add much
toward making the house a real home and giving
each member a mother to turn to at a time when
he is away from his own home."
I wondered if he finds a mother so necessary to the
lives of our students, why he hasn't considered that
perhaps they also need a father to guide them
iti the troubles which all too easily come to boys,
lie certainly cant be thinking that such a father ex
ists m the cold, uncompromising oflice of the Dean.

Very few boys will ask for aid when their problems
will not bo understood and in the majority of cases
will not be even considered fairly. Perhaps he re
alizes that most of the boys still go to Dean Culver
where they receive sound advice, sympathy, and a true
understanding by a mail who knows boys and wishes
to help them.
