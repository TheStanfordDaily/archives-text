# LITTLE BRATS
## 
### 
rpHE EDITOR, SIR:
No house mothers for Stanford students because
they would curb the students' idea that when they are
away from home they can break all the rules of good
behavior, courtesy and consideration for others! Do
you go to college to learn to take your place in the
world or to spend four years being BRAT 3? A hou.se
mother would remind them that there are certain de
cencies and obligations that heretofore have been ruth
lessly set aside when the students enroll at Stanford.
Stanford students are known all over the world as
"ill-mannered BRATS," so, of course, anything that
would ruin that reputation would not be good.
The very fact that the authorities at Stanford are
beginning to be aware of this "lovely reputation" and
the necessity of doing something about it, even to the
extent of suggesting house mothers, is completely ig
nored by the students in their rejection of the idea.
One said that a few better table manners would not be
worth the price. Anything that would show the world
that Stanford students are something besides BRATS
would be worth any price.
