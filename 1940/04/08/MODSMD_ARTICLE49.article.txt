### SHERMAN MELIINKOFF 
THE SOIJD SOUTH
r jPUSCALOOSA, Ala.—There is only one answer to
the political question in Alabama: "Ah'm a Demo
crat." And the answer comes with the same proud
and confident expression that one might use in af
firming an orthodox religious belief.
Roosevelt jokes are funny, but a vaudeville team
touring the South would do well to get some good gags
about the Republicans. Very few people would be
offended.
It isn't that Roosevelt is God's right hand down
here. The President is generally very popular, but
many Southerners share Republican-sponsored dis
taste for some of the New Deal's more liberal meas
ures—like the National Labor Relations Act. But
those Southerners who strongly criticize President
Roosevelt need not elate the hearts of John Hamilton
or Thomas Dewey. Approval of President Roosevelt
or disapproval of President. Roosevelt—the Republic
ans will have no particular reason for a festival spirit
south of the Mason-Dixon Line.
Party politics are overwhelming. Democratic
nomination for a state office is tantamount to election.
And here is the way an anti-Roosevelt Southerner
explains his case: "Ah don't lahk Roosevelt; he's too
radical. Hull or Gahnah would be bettah. But if the
Democrats nominate Roosevelt? Well, ah'm a Demo
crat. Ah b'lieve Roosevelt would carry the state."
* * * #
so we are finding out what political science
students mean when they speak of the "Solid
South." Dewey wouldn't even make a popular screen
attraction in Tuscaloosa—for all his glamour. The
people prefer "Gone with the Wind" for entertainment.
Furthermore, although it may shock Cactus Jack
Garner, Texas college students don't think the Vice-
President deserves even money in his home state.
Many Texans are proud of their native son whom
John L. Lewis called "a whiskey drinking, evil old
man." But few sons of the Lone Star State are ready
to gamble a lean steer on Garner's chances of win
ning the nomination.
Cordell Hull is respected by all and advocated for
the presidency by some. But Roosevelt seems to be
the favorite, if he should choose to seek third-term
support from Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, and like
minded Yankee-damners.
The one disconsonant note in the solid South, how
ever, appears in Roosevelt's great enemy, the Press. A
columnist in the Birmingham Age-Herald roasted the
New Deal today, but not with Southern style cooking.
He spoke of Dewey as a "courageous Roosevelt critic"
and claimed "a good sound head" for Taft, even if the
Senator, "frankly, has a dry personality."
But Roosevelt, of course, won over the opposition
of the press in 193 G. And whether or not he wins in
the East and West in 1940, it will take some rather
imposing issues and expensive campaigns to dissolve
the solid South.
I can still hear Gorman Jones, one of Alabama's
finest debaters, as he faced the audience to argue a
Roosevelt third term. "Ladies and gentlemen," he be
gan, "I want to make it clear that I am a Democrat!"
(applause).

so we are finding out what political science
students mean when they speak of the "Solid
South." Dewey wouldn't even make a popular screen
attraction in Tuscaloosa—for all his glamour. The
people prefer "Gone with the Wind" for entertainment.
Furthermore, although it may shock Cactus Jack
Garner, Texas college students don't think the Vice-
President deserves even money in his home state.
Many Texans are proud of their native son whom
John L. Lewis called "a whiskey drinking, evil old
man." But few sons of the Lone Star State are ready
to gamble a lean steer on Garner's chances of win
ning the nomination.
Cordell Hull is respected by all and advocated for
the presidency by some. But Roosevelt seems to be
the favorite, if he should choose to seek third-term
support from Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, and like
minded Yankee-damners.
The one disconsonant note in the solid South, how
ever, appears in Roosevelt's great enemy, the Press. A
columnist in the Birmingham Age-Herald roasted the
New Deal today, but not with Southern style cooking.
He spoke of Dewey as a "courageous Roosevelt critic"
and claimed "a good sound head" for Taft, even if the
Senator, "frankly, has a dry personality."
But Roosevelt, of course, won over the opposition
of the press in 193 G. And whether or not he wins in
the East and West in 1940, it will take some rather
imposing issues and expensive campaigns to dissolve
the solid South.
I can still hear Gorman Jones, one of Alabama's
finest debaters, as he faced the audience to argue a
Roosevelt third term. "Ladies and gentlemen," he be
gan, "I want to make it clear that I am a Democrat!"
(applause).
THE SOIJD SOUTH
r jPUSCALOOSA, Ala.—There is only one answer to
the political question in Alabama: "Ah'm a Demo
crat." And the answer comes with the same proud
and confident expression that one might use in af
firming an orthodox religious belief.
Roosevelt jokes are funny, but a vaudeville team
touring the South would do well to get some good gags
about the Republicans. Very few people would be
offended.
It isn't that Roosevelt is God's right hand down
here. The President is generally very popular, but
many Southerners share Republican-sponsored dis
taste for some of the New Deal's more liberal meas
ures—like the National Labor Relations Act. But
those Southerners who strongly criticize President
Roosevelt need not elate the hearts of John Hamilton
or Thomas Dewey. Approval of President Roosevelt
or disapproval of President. Roosevelt—the Republic
ans will have no particular reason for a festival spirit
south of the Mason-Dixon Line.
Party politics are overwhelming. Democratic
nomination for a state office is tantamount to election.
And here is the way an anti-Roosevelt Southerner
explains his case: "Ah don't lahk Roosevelt; he's too
radical. Hull or Gahnah would be bettah. But if the
Democrats nominate Roosevelt? Well, ah'm a Demo
crat. Ah b'lieve Roosevelt would carry the state."
