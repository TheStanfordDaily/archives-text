### DOUG JAQUES 
When he was filling out an application for a job
the other night, he asked, "What is a high sounding
word for kennel club?"
What docs he want? You would think a guy would
settle for: And in the summer of 07 I was an attend
ant. at a kennel club, when what, he really means to
say is, during the summer of 07 I was a bookie at a
race track.
You remember those days, madamc, when gambling
was occasionally profitable if not exactly legal. And
your husband would put his savings ($2 cash) on the
wrong dog, and fall by the wayside. And a traveling
chatauqua would come in and pitch a tent over him
and sing, "Down with booze, down with booze; we
want groceries and wc want shoes."
No, madamc, if you are a freshman you won't re
member this.
