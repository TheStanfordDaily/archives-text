"VIRGINIA CITY," now playing
at the Fox-Stanford Theater.
Warner Brothers made sure this
was no ordinary "hoss oprey" by
adding to the usual western pro
duction tricks the Civil War, gold
bullion, three stars and about
$1,000,000.
Virginia City is now a ghost town
about 20 miles from the Biggest Little
City in the World, Reno. In the
days.of the Civil War, and the set
ting of the picture, it was one of the
richest cities in the United States.
The rich mines were owned by
Southerners and that is the basis of
the story.
CONFEDERATES SEND MONEY
When the position of the South
became worse in the last months of
the Civil War, the mine owners of
Virginia City, the Southern ones, of
fered the Confederate government
$5,000,000 in gold bullion. The plot
of the picture concerns itself with the
valiant efforts of the Confederate
sympathizers to get the gold into the
South.
Randolph Scott is given the best
break he has had for months, cast as
the Confederate officer who lead the
packtrain carrying the gold. The
part was made to order and his quiet
Southern manner was a perfect foil
to Errol Flynn's dashing brilliance.
FLYNN IS RIVAL
Flynn, naturally, was Scott's rival
both in love and in war, and in addi
tion was his usual gallant, dashing,
and handsome self. He galloped,
shot, and loved his way through the
picture in his best movie manner,
which is everything a woman movie
goer could ask for.
A far cry from her heavy, dra
matic roles, Miriam Hopkins cast as
a saloon entertainer who works as a
Southern spy in her spare time, re
veals some hidden talent as a singer
and can-can dancer. Remembering
"The Old Maid," it is hard not to
feel that she was wasted in this pic
ture.
ALSO MARCH OF TIME'
The worst bit of casting is found
in the case of Humphrey Bogart,
who was the leader of a gay gang
called Morell's Gorillas.
An extremely interesting and ab
sorbing March of Time on the Vati
can City completed the program.â€”
