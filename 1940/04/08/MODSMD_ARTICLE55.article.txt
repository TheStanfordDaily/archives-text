# Meeting of Fund Heads Postponed
## 
### 
Last Saturday's scheduled meeting
of executives in charge of the Stan
ford Fund and senior drive for the
fund was again postponed, for the
third time, until some future date
at which reports will be ready for
consideration.
Such action pends the completion
of* reports by the senior committee,
headed by Stan Swafford and Bob
Livingston, senior president.
