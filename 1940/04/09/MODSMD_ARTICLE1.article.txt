r T*HE bees of Hell hummed in Eu
rope last night.
As this column went to press, dis
patches from all centers of the globe
were telling an unbelieving world
that German troop ships were en
route to Norway; that Nazi troops
had crossed the frontier into Den
mark.
Last official bulletin received from
Berlin was a caustic denial of all
Danish reports. Significantly, no
mention was made of the Norwe
gian crisis.
Lines of communication from
■ Norway alternately buzzed and
stopped, as frantic efforts to keep
contacts open met with only par
tial success. All reports of the
Danish invasion were received
from London.
Off the Norwegian coast, British
and German worships met in a naval
encounter near the narrow Skag
gcrak straits. High point of naval
events was the sinking of a heavily
laden German troopship with much
loss of life.
London press reports were sur
prisingly certain that information of
the Danish invasion was correct.
They said that parts of the Danish
capital were occupied by soldiers of
the Reich. They described the ar
rival of three large German trans
ports in the Copenhagen harbor.
«• >> *
press bulle
k tins told an almost unbelievable
story of pressure against a fright
ened Norwegian kingdom. They
told of a pitched battle in which
coastal batteries ejected several un
identified foreign warships from the
Oslo fjord. The .foreign warships
were believed to be Gentian.
In Norway, all precautions
were taken to repulse a possible
dircct attack from German troop
ships. Air raid practices were
held, all lighthouses were extin
guished, gas masks were issued for
the first time, the Norwegian army
was warned that "danger from a
foreign foe was imminent."
Strangely paradoxical was the
situation of the Norwegian govern
ment.
Bone of the Norwegian conten
tion was the extension of the British
blockade to include Norway's coastal
waters. Three complete mine fields
were laid in this area by England.
This was the German reason for
preparations against the little Scan
dinavian country.
But all prcparatons in Norway
were made against possible invasion
by German troops or warships. For
a cause that was neither Norway's
fault nor in her power to handle.
♦ ♦ *
1 AYING of the mine fields by
J Britain was answered by a
sharp Norwegian note of protest. To
no avail. Then Norway turned to
the Reich for a possible diplomatic
conference. Again there was noth
ing doing.
Last night's events put Norway
in the unenviable position of the
innocent, bystander. But events of
the next few days, perhaps of the
.next few hours, must pull her
headlong into World War 11.
Again, strangely enough, Norway
will probably be forced into a mili
tary alignment with Britain, the
power which was directly responsible
for her dramatic entrance into the
conflict. The one strong statement
which emerged from the chaos of
press reports was that in which
Norway said: "If German troops
land, it means war!"
Which apparently is the point.
England, long-searching for a
new war front, look her chances
in Norway with this end in mind.
Berlin, knowing that her ore im
ports from Scandinavia were es
sential, must light for them or
perish economically.
All of which must help Norway's
feelings immensely.
As these lines are being written
reports are still coming in from ev
ery nerve center of Europe. All of
these tell a talc of a frightened Nor
wegian nation . . . one ready to
fight in any eventuality. And one
which will in all probability be
forced to fight a war for existence
in the near future.
