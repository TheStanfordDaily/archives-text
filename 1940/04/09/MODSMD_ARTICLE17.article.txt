# Campus Political Battle Reaches Peak Tonight At Row, Hall Caucuses
## Upper, Lower Row Factions Select Slates 
### ROWAN HALL 
Lacking only songs by Cole Porter,
Stanford's current sophisticated, mu
sical-comedy political campaign will
reach the finale of its first act to
night when both Hall and Row
name their candidates at their re
spective caucuscs.
Two representatives from each
fraternity and sorority, chairmanned
by Dean Johnson, Fiji, will meet in
the basement of the Women's Club
house at 7 o'clock to pick the Row
slate. Each house will be allowed
but one vote in the balloting, ac
cording to Bud McDufiic, Plii Dell,
and Bob Richardson, Phi Psi, unoffi
cial heads of the Lower and Upper
Row factions.
HALLS TO APPROVE LIST
Hall men will convene at 10 o'clock
in Toyon lobby to rubberstamp a
list of candidates previously selected
for them at a meeting of Interclub
Council at 7:30 o'clock. In an effort
to unite the voting power of the
men's and women's halls, representa
tives of the Lagunita casas and the
Union units have been invited to
attend the caucus tonight.
This afternoon at 2 o'clock moguls
of the Upper Row will hold a pre
liminary caucus at the Phi Psi house
to line up their supporters firmly
behind the favorite sons. At 4 o'clock
the Lower Row chiefs will run off
a meeting at the Chi Psi lodge for
the same purpose.
LOWER ROW SLATE
Bruce Jessup, Beta, and Art. Gore,
Phi Delt, were picked as running
mates on the Lower Row slate at a
pow-wow run by McDufiic yesterday
afternoon at the Beta house. Repre
sentatives present were requested to
ask their houses which of these men
they would prefer for their candidate
for A.S.S.U. president, assuming that
the other man will run for senior
class president.
Although he was not given first
"consideration at the conclave, Ned
Ptigh signified his willingness to tag
along with the Jcssup-Gore machine.
The Lower Row line-up will be
completed when the houses indicate
whom they want in the number-one
spot at this afternoon's meeting.
UPPER ROW SLATE
Meanwhile, the brass-hats of the
Upper Row went into a huddle last
night and emerged with a tentative
slate headed by Greyson Bryan, Phi
Psi, for A.S.S.U. head, and Pete
Whittlesey, Kappa Sig, for senior
prexy. This slate will be presented
to the caucus for approval, but the
up-town swamis stated they would
abide by the caucus' decision if
beaten, and not split Row ranks.
The Hall ticket remains mostly
rumor. The latest name put for
ward for student body chief was
that of Dwight Hutchinson, El Cani
po and manager of Toyon. El Toro's
basketballing Jack Alltucker is still
very much in the running. Others
jockeying for the senior starting
posts are Frank Bray, Sequoia's claim
to fame; Bob Einstein, El Carnpo;
and Stan Glikbarg and Bob Low,
both of the Toro club.
