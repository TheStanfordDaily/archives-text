### 
BULLETIN
WASHINGTON. Tuesday, April 9 (UP). —The State Department re
ceived word early today in a telegram from the United States Minister at
Oslo that the Norwegian Foreign Minister had informed her that Norway
is at war with Germany.
The department's statement:
"The American Minister to Oslo, Mrs. J. Borden Ilarriman, tele
graphed the Department of State tonight that the Foreign Minister in
formed her that the Norwegians have lired on four German warships
coming up the Oslo Fjord and that Norway is at war with Germany."

Attaches at the Norwegian 1c- <
gation here said they had been
advised by the State Department
of its communication from Mrs.
Harriman but that they had no
other information.
STOCKHOLM, Tucs., April 9
(UP). —The Norwegian radio said
today that German troops have
landed on the south coast of Nor
way.
OSLO, Norway, Tucs., April 9
(UP). —Fears Germany may attempt
to land troops in Norway spread
early today after a 75-minute air
raid alarm in Oslo while unidenti
fied planes droned overhead and it
was reported 100 Nazi warships and
planes are converging upon the
southern coast.
The warships, said in some ac
counts to be led by a Nazi "pocket
battleship," were reported steaming
toward the narrow Skagerrak
Straits, where British submarines
sank a troop-laden German military
transport and two or three other
Nazi ships yesterday.
TROOP SHIP SINKS
The statement that the Rio de Ja
neiro, which went down with three
torpedoes in her just outside the
three-mile limit of territorial waters,
was en route to land troops on Nor
wegian soil were not confirmed by
any other sources, however.
There was speculation the sol
diers aboard the transport might
have been Germans who fought in
the Spanish civil war whose return
home had been delayed by the Eu
ropean war.
Should Germany attempt to land
troops many believe that the nation
would have no alternative but war.
GOVERNMENT ACTS
The government during the night
took strong warlike measures as a
precaution, including:
1. The blacking out of all coasts
and an air raid alarm In Oslo,
probably a test.
2. Ex t i ng u is he d lighthouses
along the coasts.
3. Issued gas masks to military
units.
4.Cancelled leaves of all soldiers
and sailors at the iron ore port of
Narvik, 2500 miles above the Arc
tic Circle and chief port of supply
for Germany's iron ore require
ments.

OSLO, Norway, Tucs., April 9
(UP). —Fears Germany may attempt
to land troops in Norway spread
early today after a 75-minute air
raid alarm in Oslo while unidenti
fied planes droned overhead and it
was reported 100 Nazi warships and
planes are converging upon the
southern coast.
The warships, said in some ac
counts to be led by a Nazi "pocket
battleship," were reported steaming
toward the narrow Skagerrak
Straits, where British submarines
sank a troop-laden German military
transport and two or three other
Nazi ships yesterday.
TROOP SHIP SINKS
The statement that the Rio de Ja
neiro, which went down with three
torpedoes in her just outside the
three-mile limit of territorial waters,
was en route to land troops on Nor
wegian soil were not confirmed by
any other sources, however.
There was speculation the sol
diers aboard the transport might
have been Germans who fought in
the Spanish civil war whose return
home had been delayed by the Eu
ropean war.
Should Germany attempt to land
troops many believe that the nation
would have no alternative but war.
GOVERNMENT ACTS
The government during the night
took strong warlike measures as a
precaution, including:
1. The blacking out of all coasts
and an air raid alarm In Oslo,
probably a test.
2. Ex t i ng u is he d lighthouses
along the coasts.
3. Issued gas masks to military
units.
4.Cancelled leaves of all soldiers
and sailors at the iron ore port of
Narvik, 2500 miles above the Arc
tic Circle and chief port of supply
for Germany's iron ore require
ments.
