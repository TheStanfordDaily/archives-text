# Pacific Coast Forensic Croup To Meet at Stanford in 1941
## 
### 
Stanford will be host to the Pacific Forensic League convention in
spring quarter next year, it was decided last week-end at the league's j
annual meet, held this year at Oregon State College, in Corvailis.
Farm delegates attending the Oregon conference were Syd Terry, Boh !
Newell, Colgate Dorr, Maurice Knox, Milton Marks, Jack Walnuts, Kay

Kitagawa. and Dr. Lee T.
varsity debate coach.
The conference discussions were
divided in two sections, competitive j
and problem-solving. Each partici
pating school was allowed to enter
one contestant in each of the three
competitive divisions. Representing
Stanford in the oratorical meet was
Kay Kitagawa, who achieved the
finals. Syd Terry entered the ex
temporaneous speaking contest and
Bob Newell spoke for the Farm in
the after-dinner speech division.
NEW TYPE OF DEBATE
General topic for the entire con
vention was "Propaganda." Pioneer
ing a new approach in the debate
field, the league instituted a new
type of problem-solving debating.
The ultimate object is to arrive at a
compromise, after all sides of the
question have been argued and
weighed.
The problem-solving sections was
subdivided to consider (1) definition
of the term; (2) connected problems;
(3) possible solutions; (4) speeches
of advocacy. It is believed that this
relatively new style of debate will I
give a broad, comprehensive view :
of the subject.

Stanford will be host to the Pacific Forensic League convention in
spring quarter next year, it was decided last week-end at the league's j
annual meet, held this year at Oregon State College, in Corvailis.
Farm delegates attending the Oregon conference were Syd Terry, Boh !
Newell, Colgate Dorr, Maurice Knox, Milton Marks, Jack Walnuts, Kay

Kitagawa. and Dr. Lee T.
varsity debate coach.
The conference discussions were
divided in two sections, competitive j
and problem-solving. Each partici
pating school was allowed to enter
one contestant in each of the three
competitive divisions. Representing
Stanford in the oratorical meet was
Kay Kitagawa, who achieved the
finals. Syd Terry entered the ex
temporaneous speaking contest and
Bob Newell spoke for the Farm in
the after-dinner speech division.
NEW TYPE OF DEBATE
General topic for the entire con
vention was "Propaganda." Pioneer
ing a new approach in the debate
field, the league instituted a new
type of problem-solving debating.
The ultimate object is to arrive at a
compromise, after all sides of the
question have been argued and
weighed.
The problem-solving sections was
subdivided to consider (1) definition
of the term; (2) connected problems;
(3) possible solutions; (4) speeches
of advocacy. It is believed that this
relatively new style of debate will I
give a broad, comprehensive view :
of the subject.
Colleges and universities attend
ing the April 3, 4, and 5 conference j
included Oregon State, U.S.C., Po- j
mona, C.0.P., University of Oregon, j
Washington State, University of
Washington, Willamette, University
