# Encina Dance Set For Friday Night
## 
### 
Under the direction of Ralph
Schaffarzick, work is progressing on
the extensive decorations for the sec
ond annual Encina Prom scheduled
for next Friday, April 12.
The theme of the dance is sea-life,
with the, lobby billed as the "Marine
Room," and an intriguing mystery
theme so far known to the public
only as the "Top of the Hall." The
dance is being opened to the public
for the first time this year, and it is
hoped by the Encina Club officers
that it will become an annual cam
pus affair.
Bids for the dance, priced at $2 per
couple, are being sold in the hall by
members of publicty director Ben
Parkinson's contact committee, and
are also on sale at the A.S.S.U. of
fices. Carvel Craig and his orchestra
have been signed for the affair, and
ample refreshments have been prom
ised by Co-chairmen Bob Blake and
Bill Kroener.
