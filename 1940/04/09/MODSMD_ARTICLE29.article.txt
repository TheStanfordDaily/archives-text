PORTLAND, Ore., April 8 (UP).
â€”The city of San Francisco's grants
to relief recipients are the highest
in the nation, Mayor Angelo J.
Rossi told more than 100 executives
at the Western Conference of May
ors today, but even so they do not
provide for existence on a "health
and decency" basis.
Rossi, discussing "unemployment
in western cities," said "it is admit
tedly impossible for federal and
local agencies to supply adequate
relief, and we must find another way
out. That way is increased produc
tion - more jobs, more salaries, more
expansion.
Countryfolk of Gloucestershire
have observed a cheese-rolling cere
mony for centuries. Runners roll a
wheel downhill, and the winner of
the race gets a cheese.
