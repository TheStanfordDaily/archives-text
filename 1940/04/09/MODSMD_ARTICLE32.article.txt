The Woltermen got one more in
the fourth inning when Boone, who
had a .500 day at bat. singled to right
field, stole second, went to third on
Guyer's error of Pfyl's rap, and

with Costello and Russ Smith on
base. However, Sinclair made a good
stop of "Coot's" hard-hit ball down
the third base line, forcing Costello
at third to end the game.

Tallying three runs in a hectic seventh inning on one hit, two walks,
and two errors, the U.C.L.A. basehallers defeated Stanford 3-2 yesterday
afternoon to sink the Indians deeper into the league cellar.
Dspite (he fact that he pitched almost flawless hall, giving up only one
hit, Quentin "Cootie" Thompson, Stanford's ace moundsman. was charged

with another defeat, his third
the league season.
The turning point in the game |
came when Sinclair opened the sev
enth inning for the Bruins with a
Texas Leaguer into short center j
field. Jackie Robinson, the U.C.L.A.
all-sport ace, forced Sinclair at sec
ond but was safe at first on a fielder's
choice and moved to second when
Thompson walked Guyer.
BRUINS SCORE
On a double steal Robinson and
Guyer each advanced a base, and the j
dusky negro star scored on Moore's j
infield out. Null was walked, Bart
lett drove the ball through "Ike"
Boone, scoring Guyer, and pinch
hitter Hill scored Null on a fly to
right-center field which Bob Tem
pleton barely failed to catch. Bell
grounded out to Monte Pl'yl to end
the inning.
The game opened as the Cards set
the Bruins down one, two, three, and
tallied one run in their half of the
frame on Harry Parsons' hit to cen
ter field and Boone's double to deep
left.
The Woltermen got one more in
the fourth inning when Boone, who
had a .500 day at bat. singled to right
field, stole second, went to third on
Guyer's error of Pfyl's rap, and
scored on a double steal when the
catcher, Bell, pegged to second in an
attempt to nip Pfyl.
CARDS COME CLOSE
Following Boone's score in the
fourth canto, the stage was set for
more tallying when Templeton and
Costello walked to fill the bases, but
little Herb Atkinson passed a strike.
Fate gave Thompson a chance to
be the hero and win his own game
when, in the last half of the ninth
with the score 3-2 against him, the
big Indian hurler came to the plate
with Costello and Russ Smith on
base. However, Sinclair made a good
stop of "Coot's" hard-hit ball down
the third base line, forcing Costello
at third to end the game.
Tomorrow afternoon at 3:15 o'clock
in the Sunken Diamond the Indians
will take on the Santa Clara Broncos
in a league game. Claude Purkitt
will be on the mound for Stanford.
