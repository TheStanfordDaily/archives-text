# Cardinal Cindermen Warm Up For Bruin 'Practice' Meet
## 
### 
Coach Bill Ellington made several
startling discoveries in yesterday's
track practice concerning the ability
of his middle-distance men. With
U.C.L.A.'s ragged track team as com
petition this Saturday, Ellington has
no current worries and consequently
took time off yesterday to do a little
experimenting.
In the first place he sent Ernie
Clark through a 669-yard run to
strengthen his third-best quarter
miler, who would probably be tops
on any other normal track team.
Ernie convincingly showed that he
needed little strengthening, for he
ran 1:20 at this odd distance, clipping
two full seconds off his own best
time.
HYDE RUNS MILE
For the same purpose, Ellington
sent Blair Hyde, Stanford's winner
in the half-mile against Olympic
Club in last Saturday's meet, whirl
ing through three laps. Blair showed
that now he is a full-fledged track
man and that boxing was only a
side line when he ran those three
laps in 3:07. To realize just how good
this is, consider that Blair was able
to struggle the last lap in a poor 70
seconds to complete the mile.
This would make his time 4:17, a
mighty fine mile. Yet Blair is not a
miler but a half-miler with more
speed than endurance. This race
showed definite signs of his gaining
the strength he needs and the n?xt
time he rambles the half, look for a
time approaching 1:52.
SKRABLE TRIES QUARTER
The third victim of Ellington's ex
periments was Burman Skrable, who
always runs better in practice than
in meets. Burman and four other
distance men, Hyde, Paul and Jack
Moore, and Mushy Girard, were
told to run a 53-second lap. Skrable
didn t understand that he was sup
posed to come as close as possible
to this time but got out there and
ran like the dickens.
The result was a 50.7 quarter
mile for Burman, a mighty fine time
considering that he is a novice at
this distance. So, in view of this
fact, Ellington has decided to run
Skrable in the 440 against U.C.L.A.

this Saturday. It's not that "Old
Bill" hasn't enough quarter-milers,
but against U.C.L.A. his top three
men in this event will be resting
themselves for their crack at the
world's record in the mile relay,
Les Johnson will also run with
Skrable in this event Saturday. The
fact that Captain Clyde Jeffrey will
run only the 100-yard dash and that
Charlie Shaw will save liimself for
the relay leaves the Cards appar
ently barren in the 220-yard dash.
But Don McFarland and Ken Bat
taglia, though they were third and
fourth respectively last Saturday
against the Club, should come home
one-two against the Bruins.
