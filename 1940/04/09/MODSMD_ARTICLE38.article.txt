NEW YORK. April 8 (UP).—The
most engaging personality in base
ball is Theodore Francis Williams,
the kid outfielder of the Boston Red
Sox. His boyish enthusiasm, his
twinkling eyes and his burning am
bition to become the greatest hitter
in baseball history are seen and felt
within the first few minutes you are
with him.
Ted Williams is the boy who
played hookey from school. He's
Huckleberry Finn, Horatio Alger,
Penrod and Tom Sawyer all rolled
into one. He's the Ail-American
boy playing a man's game and be
fore he's through he is liable to be
the biggest idol the game's ever
known—if misfortune doesn't over
take him.
At 21. Williams, with a style all
his own and utterly different from
any ever used by a ball player be
fore, can drive a ball farther than
any player in baseball.
