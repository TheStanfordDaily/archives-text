LONDON, Tuesday, April 9 (UP).
â€”British sourecs reported today that
German forces have invaded Den
mark and that troops landed from
three German warships have occu
pied parts of the Danish capital.
The Danes apparently made no
resistance.
The German invasion, the British
Exchange Telegraph Company re
ported, was carried out by land and
sea.
Airplanes earlier had scouted all
over Denmark.
Three large German ships, re
portedly transports, were in the Co
penhagen harbor.

The troop transports anchored in
the "Little Belt" and men started
going ashore in barges.
Ordinary communications between
London and Copenhagen were in
terrupted.
Fragmentary messages, however,
indicated that the Germans were
swarming in with such speed that
occupation of key centers in the
little Danish state might be com
pleted within 24 hours.
A Danish garrison at Sonderburg
was reported retreating southward
to avoid contact with the Germans.
