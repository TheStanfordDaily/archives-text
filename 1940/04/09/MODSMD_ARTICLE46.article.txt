POLITICS is a funny business.
Collegiate politics is hilarious.
But the amazing thing is that we at Stanford
have an unusual knack of getting the right
people into the top elective positions. We may
caucus ourselves to death and make more deals
than Jim Farley and Huey Long combined have
in their equally compromising careers, but our
ultimate results are far from inferior. And
strangely enough, no successful Farm candi
date has ever been seriously hampered in the
execution of his job because of over-enthusias
tic campaign promises.
The only thing that Stanford lacks is some
system of self-control over her caucus system.
Caucuses are fun, like going to the movies in
Menlo Park, but it seems that every house,
club, or individual desiring some ultimate end,
rushes to the nearest telephone and calls the
boys together. The resulting chaos is obvious.
The sophomores gather to fight the juniors
and seniors, the women gather to assert some
degree of independence from the little hier
archy being built up by Women's Conference's
own pet nominating committee. The Hall men
have had several pre-caucus meets already and
will have one big set-to tonight in which the
candidates unquestionably agreed upon al
ready will be put to the "open" meeting.
The situation on the Row has been as com
plicated with five and sometimes six top stu
dent body presidential aspirants as well as a
few lesser lights going to as many as five or
six meetings in a single day in an effort to
align with the "right" group.
College politics sounds particularly silly
after hearing the rather foreboding news last
night that Denmark had been invaded and Nor
way had declared war on Germany. This some
what inane discussion now sounds all the more
ludicrous with the land troops starting to move
in Europe.
The thought of other college men and women
being deprived of the right to laugh and to
hold all the caucuses they darn well please
makes one's back tingle.
So maybe it's all right for us to stick to our
own little collegiate world with all its funny
politics and situations.
One international situation could blow up
that world.

few lesser lights going to as many as five or
six meetings in a single day in an effort to
align with the "right" group.
College politics sounds particularly silly
after hearing the rather foreboding news last
night that Denmark had been invaded and Nor
way had declared war on Germany. This some
what inane discussion now sounds all the more
ludicrous with the land troops starting to move
in Europe.
The thought of other college men and women
being deprived of the right to laugh and to
hold all the caucuses they darn well please
makes one's back tingle.
So maybe it's all right for us to stick to our
own little collegiate world with all its funny
politics and situations.
One international situation could blow up
that world.
POLITICS is a funny business.
Collegiate politics is hilarious.
But the amazing thing is that we at Stanford
have an unusual knack of getting the right
people into the top elective positions. We may
caucus ourselves to death and make more deals
than Jim Farley and Huey Long combined have
in their equally compromising careers, but our
ultimate results are far from inferior. And
strangely enough, no successful Farm candi
date has ever been seriously hampered in the
execution of his job because of over-enthusias
tic campaign promises.
The only thing that Stanford lacks is some
system of self-control over her caucus system.
Caucuses are fun, like going to the movies in
Menlo Park, but it seems that every house,
club, or individual desiring some ultimate end,
rushes to the nearest telephone and calls the
boys together. The resulting chaos is obvious.
The sophomores gather to fight the juniors
and seniors, the women gather to assert some
degree of independence from the little hier
archy being built up by Women's Conference's
own pet nominating committee. The Hall men
have had several pre-caucus meets already and
will have one big set-to tonight in which the
candidates unquestionably agreed upon al
ready will be put to the "open" meeting.
The situation on the Row has been as com
plicated with five and sometimes six top stu
dent body presidential aspirants as well as a
few lesser lights going to as many as five or
six meetings in a single day in an effort to
align with the "right" group.
