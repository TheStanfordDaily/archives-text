# CAMPUS OPINION
## ON FATHERLY ADVICE 
### 
r |MIE EDITOR, SIR:
Yesterday some smart chap wrote an extremely
derogatory sketch on Dean Bunn, and this same chap
had the temerity to sign his name "A Boy in Need of
a Father." He was at least correct on this score, for
anyone with good breeding, regardless of his sincerity,
should have better taste than to uphold a personal
grudge publicly.
In the first place, your condemnation of the Dean's
office is far from the truth. Ask anyone who knows
the Dean what kind of a reception they received from
him, and you will undoubtedly discover to your utter
amazement that he is a pretty fine fellow. And your
uncalled-for remark about boys going largely to Dean
Culver these days is the most erroneous statement yet.
Mr. X, you may not care for house mothersâ€”un
doubtedly they would cramp your style. It would be
shameful if you absorbed some manners. But every
man is free to enjoy his own opinion, you have yours,
and I have mine; nevertheless, let me suggest that
you show discretion with your maleficent opinions.
And by the way, Mr. X, I am graduating soon, I
hope; so this epistle should have no effect upon my
position here at Stanford.
