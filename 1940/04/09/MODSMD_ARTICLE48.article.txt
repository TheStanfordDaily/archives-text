r |MIE EDITOR, SIR:
Stanford men may boast of pood sires, but they
certainly cannot claim to be well-bred. We are now
attending an advanced nursery school for egocentric
children. Water fights, bonfires, and the annual repair
bill in Encina demonstrate the lack of respect for oth
ers or for property.
You have all heard the complaint: "Where can I
study?" One's own room and desk is the proper place
for study. If fraternity houses are noisy, it is because
of training in Encina, the University-sponsored dormi
tory. That is the place to start with housemothers.
Good manners can be exercised at meal times: why not
try it at Encina Commons?
Segregating the freshmen has the wonderful effect
of preventing them from learning University tradi
tions and good study habits from the uppcrclassmen.
Doctoring up the fraternities is a year too late, but
even so, let's have housemothers, and Stanford will
have better disciplined and more respectable grad
uates.
