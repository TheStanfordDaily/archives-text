# BULL SESSION
## 
### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
VL'ASIIINGTON, D.C.—Up the most photographed
steps in the United States, under the news-reel
familiar dome, to the right, and up the elevator to

the third floor. The room is large and imposing, with
stained glass angels looking down from the ceiling, 35
Presidents' statues in high niches, a gallery all around
the room, and two divisions of seats and desks on the
floor. It is the home of the greatest debating society
in the world—the United States Senate.
Nicotine and whiskey-soaked "Cactus Jack" Gar
ner, Washington's finest poker player, raps his gavel
at 12 noon and the highest legislative body in America
is in session. A shrewd old man who looks like a 6-foot
mole with white hair, rises to his feet with
years of self confidence. "Mr. Chairman," Pat Harri
son of Mississippi drawls, "I should like to call the
attention of the Senate ..."
Horse-trader Pat Is actually not calling the Sen
ate's attention to anything, because only 25 of the 96
Senators are present, and 20 of these are chattering
good-naturedly to one another, four are reading news
papers. Only Senator Hattie Carraway is listening half
heartedly. The Senators listen only to vital speeches
that may change votes, and most of them attend only
crucial voting sessions.

B UT Harrison is good for a few old political maneu
vers. He gradually draws an audience and then
when Senator LaFollette begins a dynamic oration on
his amendment to the Reciprocal Trade Bills, the Sen
ate is in a minor verbal turmoil. Should there be three
or one cabinet members on the committee to review
the treaties?
"Three," says Republican Floor Leader McNary.
"One," says Garner-like Senator Connely of Texas.
"If I were president, and one of my cabinet members
voted against me, he wouldn't be on the committee
more'n a minute and a half—and neither would the
gentleman of the opposition. So why have three cabinet
members? They'll all say the same thing."
Senator O'Mahoney, a Fourth of July orator from
Wyoming, rises to attack the whole principle of recip
rocal trade. He is a dyed-in-the-wool protectionist.
He believes the Senate should ratify all trade agree
ments.
"Will the Senator yield?" asks Senator Mead of
New York.
"Gladly," O'Mahoney answers dryly, "perhaps the
Senator can enlarge upon my arguments."
"Is the distinguished Senator from Wyoming aware,"
asks Mead, "that the six trade agreements from Mc-
Kinley's administration are still waiting for Senate
ratification?"
Coughs from O'Mahoney.
♦ * V
the Senators are seldom at a loss for words.
Each one is a skilled debater, an orator to whom
emotional words are stock-in-trade. Each one is used
to badgering; each one is a badgerer.
Finally LaFollette, who looks and talks like his
fearless, anti-war father, rises to defend his program
with a 15-minute extemporaneous speech. Vote is
called for; the amendment passes.
But Senators Key Pittman and Arthur Vandenberg
are at each other now. It goes on all day.
In 1940 as in 1893, the Senate is a ceaselessly vig
orous debate society. To the right of the capitol dome
there is a maximum of free speech.
