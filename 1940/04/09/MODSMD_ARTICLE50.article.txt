HISTORY. 1942
In the spring of '42, affairs took a sudden and sur
prising turn here, as you can find by reading E. E.
Jones' revealing book, "How It Was on the Farm in
'42."
It started out like any other spring. The word got
around that there was going to be an election, then
the sophomores became very excited and wouldn't
speak to anyone but each other, making every sopho
more prove he was a sophomore and nothing but a
sophomore by a secret test they had.
The Betas called the Phi Delts and said, "How would
it be if we got together some night?" And the Phi
Delts answered, "Fine, but we arc a little busy this
week. Let's make it some time after the elections are
over."
Then the Phi Delts called the Phi Psis and said,
"Will you support our man?" and the Phi Psis hung up.
So: there were three caucuses that year. The
S.A.E.'s wanted to hold a caucus—they had held
one as far hack as anyone could remember—but
they were having a little trouble. No one would
come. They were forced to hold a Hall caucus.
The Hall men would let none of their sophomores
attend, but the rest of them went. An S.A.E. got
himself elected chairman of the meeting, and the
house was happy again for another year.
The other three houses were busily arranging their
caucuses in the meantime. Their sophomore runners
were busily running from house to house in what
looked from an airplane like a series of neat double
crosses.
Then someone remembered the small houses, the
Balkan houses, the small entente. The misconception
that those houses were united and voted as one house
was again abroad.
The Betas called the small entente. "Will you come
to our caucus?"
"Well," they said, "are the Pi Phis going to he
there?" The Balkan houses had learned from hit
ter experience that they wouldn't get any men up,
and that they might as well get a little fun out of
the meeting itself.
"We're working on it." the Betas said.
Then the Phi Delts called them. "Will you
come to our caucus?"
"How about the Pi Phis?"
"That's a long story," the Phi Delts said.
And the Phi Psis called: ditto.
No soap, the small entente said. No pay-ofT.
Then one of them had an idea. Why didn't they
themselves hold a caucus and invite the Pi Phis?
It was a wild night when that idea struck the
Balkans.
The next morning a guy got on the phone. He was
very nervous. He had never called the Pi Phis before.
With shaking hands he looked up their phone number.
"Will you come to our caucus?" he gasped, and
fainted dead away.
"Yes, we would be glad to."
But he didn't know. He hadn't called the Pi Phis.
He had called the French house.
G. G. Glotz. the famous psychologist, has ex
plained how this mistake was made. The hoy who
had made the call had associated certain ideas with
the Pi Phis. They centered around glamor and
Paris, and one or two other things: his eye had
caught the name "French House." He immediately
dialed that number.
But none of the small entente knew this had
happened. When the girls came to their meeting
that night, they thought they were Pi Phis.
They were scared.
Little by little, however, their nervousness wore
off. the tension let up. What's so hot about these
females, they said. We've seen better. A lot bet
ter. Pi Phis. Huh!
It gave them great courage, finding out like this
that the Pi Phis were just females, and not so hot
at that, and when they heard one of the guys say
during a pause. "Hey, babe, what about a date," noth
ing could stop them.
They felt a new power. Nothing could stop them,
that night or all week. They put up a slate, and backed
it. They bluffed the Betas, high-hatted the Zetes.
Their men swept into office in complete victory.
Since then, however, their power has gone com
pletely. One of them at last saw a Pi Phi.

Then the Phi Delts called them. "Will you
come to our caucus?"
"How about the Pi Phis?"
"That's a long story," the Phi Delts said.
And the Phi Psis called: ditto.
No soap, the small entente said. No pay-ofT.
Then one of them had an idea. Why didn't they
themselves hold a caucus and invite the Pi Phis?
It was a wild night when that idea struck the
Balkans.
The next morning a guy got on the phone. He was
very nervous. He had never called the Pi Phis before.
With shaking hands he looked up their phone number.
"Will you come to our caucus?" he gasped, and
fainted dead away.
"Yes, we would be glad to."
But he didn't know. He hadn't called the Pi Phis.
He had called the French house.
G. G. Glotz. the famous psychologist, has ex
plained how this mistake was made. The hoy who
had made the call had associated certain ideas with
the Pi Phis. They centered around glamor and
Paris, and one or two other things: his eye had
caught the name "French House." He immediately
dialed that number.
But none of the small entente knew this had
happened. When the girls came to their meeting
that night, they thought they were Pi Phis.
They were scared.
Little by little, however, their nervousness wore
off. the tension let up. What's so hot about these
females, they said. We've seen better. A lot bet
ter. Pi Phis. Huh!
It gave them great courage, finding out like this
that the Pi Phis were just females, and not so hot
at that, and when they heard one of the guys say
during a pause. "Hey, babe, what about a date," noth
ing could stop them.
They felt a new power. Nothing could stop them,
that night or all week. They put up a slate, and backed
it. They bluffed the Betas, high-hatted the Zetes.
Their men swept into office in complete victory.
Since then, however, their power has gone com
pletely. One of them at last saw a Pi Phi.
HISTORY. 1942
In the spring of '42, affairs took a sudden and sur
prising turn here, as you can find by reading E. E.
Jones' revealing book, "How It Was on the Farm in
'42."
It started out like any other spring. The word got
around that there was going to be an election, then
the sophomores became very excited and wouldn't
speak to anyone but each other, making every sopho
more prove he was a sophomore and nothing but a
sophomore by a secret test they had.
The Betas called the Phi Delts and said, "How would
it be if we got together some night?" And the Phi
Delts answered, "Fine, but we arc a little busy this
week. Let's make it some time after the elections are
over."
Then the Phi Delts called the Phi Psis and said,
"Will you support our man?" and the Phi Psis hung up.
So: there were three caucuses that year. The
S.A.E.'s wanted to hold a caucus—they had held
one as far hack as anyone could remember—but
they were having a little trouble. No one would
come. They were forced to hold a Hall caucus.
The Hall men would let none of their sophomores
attend, but the rest of them went. An S.A.E. got
himself elected chairman of the meeting, and the
house was happy again for another year.
The other three houses were busily arranging their
caucuses in the meantime. Their sophomore runners
were busily running from house to house in what
looked from an airplane like a series of neat double
crosses.
Then someone remembered the small houses, the
Balkan houses, the small entente. The misconception
that those houses were united and voted as one house
was again abroad.
The Betas called the small entente. "Will you come
to our caucus?"
"Well," they said, "are the Pi Phis going to he
there?" The Balkan houses had learned from hit
ter experience that they wouldn't get any men up,
and that they might as well get a little fun out of
the meeting itself.
"We're working on it." the Betas said.
Then the Phi Delts called them. "Will you

HISTORY. 1942
In the spring of '42, affairs took a sudden and sur
prising turn here, as you can find by reading E. E.
Jones' revealing book, "How It Was on the Farm in
'42."
It started out like any other spring. The word got
around that there was going to be an election, then
the sophomores became very excited and wouldn't
speak to anyone but each other, making every sopho
more prove he was a sophomore and nothing but a
sophomore by a secret test they had.
The Betas called the Phi Delts and said, "How would
it be if we got together some night?" And the Phi
Delts answered, "Fine, but we arc a little busy this
week. Let's make it some time after the elections are
over."
Then the Phi Delts called the Phi Psis and said,
"Will you support our man?" and the Phi Psis hung up.
So: there were three caucuses that year. The
S.A.E.'s wanted to hold a caucus—they had held
one as far hack as anyone could remember—but
they were having a little trouble. No one would
come. They were forced to hold a Hall caucus.
The Hall men would let none of their sophomores
attend, but the rest of them went. An S.A.E. got
himself elected chairman of the meeting, and the
house was happy again for another year.
The other three houses were busily arranging their
caucuses in the meantime. Their sophomore runners
were busily running from house to house in what
looked from an airplane like a series of neat double
crosses.
Then someone remembered the small houses, the
Balkan houses, the small entente. The misconception
that those houses were united and voted as one house
was again abroad.
The Betas called the small entente. "Will you come
to our caucus?"
"Well," they said, "are the Pi Phis going to he
there?" The Balkan houses had learned from hit
ter experience that they wouldn't get any men up,
and that they might as well get a little fun out of
the meeting itself.
"We're working on it." the Betas said.
Then the Phi Delts called them. "Will you
come to our caucus?"
"How about the Pi Phis?"
"That's a long story," the Phi Delts said.
And the Phi Psis called: ditto.
No soap, the small entente said. No pay-ofT.
Then one of them had an idea. Why didn't they
themselves hold a caucus and invite the Pi Phis?
It was a wild night when that idea struck the
Balkans.
The next morning a guy got on the phone. He was
very nervous. He had never called the Pi Phis before.
With shaking hands he looked up their phone number.
"Will you come to our caucus?" he gasped, and
fainted dead away.
"Yes, we would be glad to."
But he didn't know. He hadn't called the Pi Phis.
He had called the French house.
G. G. Glotz. the famous psychologist, has ex
plained how this mistake was made. The hoy who
had made the call had associated certain ideas with
the Pi Phis. They centered around glamor and
Paris, and one or two other things: his eye had
caught the name "French House." He immediately
dialed that number.
But none of the small entente knew this had
happened. When the girls came to their meeting
that night, they thought they were Pi Phis.
They were scared.
Little by little, however, their nervousness wore
off. the tension let up. What's so hot about these
females, they said. We've seen better. A lot bet
ter. Pi Phis. Huh!
It gave them great courage, finding out like this
that the Pi Phis were just females, and not so hot
at that, and when they heard one of the guys say
during a pause. "Hey, babe, what about a date," noth
ing could stop them.
They felt a new power. Nothing could stop them,
that night or all week. They put up a slate, and backed
it. They bluffed the Betas, high-hatted the Zetes.
Their men swept into office in complete victory.
Since then, however, their power has gone com
pletely. One of them at last saw a Pi Phi.
