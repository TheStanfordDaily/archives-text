# Farm Queens' Queer Queries Lighten Libe Runners' Lives
## 
### JEFFREY LITTLEBOY 
A beautiful and breathless Stan
ford gal rushes up to the desk in the
reserve book room, points an ac
cusing finger at the attendant, and
says: "Do you have Syphilis, the
Shadow Over the Land?"
Does the attendant become pink
and confused? No indeed. That's
just all in the day's work for the
boys behind the book toboggan. In
then three-hour shifts of turning out
two tomes a minute to tireless un
dergraduates, the lads have made
quite a study of the Stanford mind
at work.
In addition to coping with verbal
requests like, "Where is The Ex
pectant Mother?" or "Do you have
Wisdom of the Body?" the staff has
to translate "Thomas—The Unadul
terated Young Lady" into Thomas—
"The Unadjusted Girl."
BEER HERE?
Then there's always somebody
who slides up through the mob and
says: "Do you have the mind that
found itself beer?" After a little
cross questioning, this turns out to
be "The Mind That Found Itself"—
Beer.
Spelling of authors' names on the
call slips reaches an all time low in
the reserve book room, the boys re
port. But all the fault isn't on the
student's side. If Polish gentlemen
with names like Pyzrobityski or
Przbyszewski write books, a few
misplaced y's, z's, and x's must re
sult inevitably.
AARON TO ZINSSER
The ground floor section of the
Stanford Libe has about 4000 books
on its shelves, ranging in alphabet
ical order from Aaron, "The Com
mon Ailment," to Hans Zinsser's
"Rats, Lice and History." Some of
the more eye-catching titles are
"Big Fleas Have Little Fleas," Heg
ner; "You Must Relax," Jacobs;
"Sleep and How to Get It," Laird;
"500 Delinquent Women," Gluck;

and "Paying Through the Teeth,"
Philips.
SMILE SWEETLY, GUiLS
The Stanford queen is the worst
offender when it comes to request
ing a book.
"Did you see that blond girl
that left just a minute ago?" one
will say. "Well, I want to take out
the book she just turned in."
But the giii who will live forever
in the hearts of the staff, the one
who brought the brightest ray of
pure idiocy into their lives, and the
one who almost made the entire per
sonnel run screaming from the Libe
was the one who submitted the fol
lowing call slip:
Title: Ibid
Author: Unknown
