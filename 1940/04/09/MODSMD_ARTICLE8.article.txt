# First Lady Claims American Future Depends on the People
## 
### 
Calling upon Americans to exert
their genius for co-operating, Mrs.
Franklin D. Roosevelt declared that
America's future depends upon the
people themselves last night from
Stanford's Memorial Hall stage.
"The leaders of the nation rellect
the ideas of the people," she stated.
"This means that your administra
tors can only go as far as the people
themselves will allow them. Thus
the future of the country is your re
sponsibility alone."
We are often tricked by the tem
porary advantages to this country of
a European war, the First Lady said,
but we do not realize its long-run
disadvantages.
"We can do better by remaining
at peace," she continued. "However,
we cannot draw walls about us
while the rest of the world goes to
destruction, not even in a land as
self-sufficient as ours. For instance,
we use 50 per cent of the world's
rubber and the same amount of the
world's coffee, producing neither.
Therefore anything that happens
concerns us."
MACHINERY FOR PEACE
Mrs. Roosevelt asserted that some
kind of machinery must exist for
deciding peace. Pointing out that
even in this country force is often
resorted to instead of reason in the
settlement of disputes, the White
House's official hostess said that the
same must be expected of nations.
"We turned down the League of
Nations," she recalled, "but that is

behind us. We didn't believe in it.
But we must be thinking how to
build for the future some method
for continued peace.
In regard to unemployment among
younger age groups, Mrs. Roosevelt
believed that our studies into that
field should be mainly concentrated
on youth. Declaring that young
people are in danger of losing their
devotion to democracy if their prob
lems are not met. sho suggested that
the communities of the United States
be organized to help them get prac
tical experience.
YOUTH JEOPARDIZED
"Our young people, those under
the age of 25, arc not being prepared
for the problems of today," she
claimed. "And youth with no fu
ture on the horizon tends to get dis
couraged, hopeless, apathetic.
"The future of this country lies in
the hands of the younger genera
tion," she continued. "Democracy
must meet their needs."
In response to a query directed to
her in the question period following
her lecture, Mrs. Roosevelt enthu
siastically supported the American
Youth Congress. She discounted the
fact that there may be radicals in
the Youth Congress, adding:
"Many of us when we were young
said and did things we didn't mean.
They are just a group of young
people attempting to solve the prob
lems of their generation and when
they ask advice of us we should have
the common good sense to attempt
an answer."
