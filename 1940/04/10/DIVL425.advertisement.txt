He doesn't
LOOK good
There is a story of a borse-tradcr who seemed reluctant to sell one of
111 is horses to a prospective buyer because, as he said, "That horse
doesn't look good.*"
I he buyer, suspecting that the dealer was trying to outwit him,
felt the horse over carefully, looked in its mouth, and decided that
the horse looked very well. Whereupon he bought the animal and
led it to his stable.
When he larnessed it and started down the road, he soon dis
covered that the dealer had been light. The horse did n't "look good."
It. was blind.
Modern buyers need have no fear of such underhand practices.
