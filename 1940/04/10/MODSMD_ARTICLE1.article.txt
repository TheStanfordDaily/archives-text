### WILSON CANNON 
IJER FUEHRER,
Care of Oslo and Copenhagen,
Heel Hitler:
I am what some people might call
an American capitalist. At any rate,
some time ago one of my friends
Cave me a few stocks. All of them
were investments in Norway and
Denmark.
Since that time I have been ex
pecting to finish Stanford and then
settle down and clip the two or three
coupons I have. You know, one of
the idle rich. But all these newspa
per stories about you have me wor
ried. Looks like I'll have to get a
job somewhere instead.
All the papers I read are telling
about your G-men, or whatever
you call them, invading Norway
and Denmark. Even the boys and
girls on The Daily were excited
about it last night.
There are some more of us capi
talists in America. And I was talk
ing to some of the boys who tell
me that all together there is two
hundred million dollars in Ameri
can money invested in those two
countries.
I remember what you did when
you took over Poland. All her obli
gations to foreign investors were
cancelled. No one over here knows
exactly what happened to the
money. Maybe Goering used it to
buy a few more uniforms.
At any rate, everyone is expect
ing you to do just about the same
thing with the American invest
ments in the latest of your two
blitzkriegs. You probably will, if
England and France keep up this
sitzkrieg attitude.
* # *
in the city the other
day was up on a soapbox. He
was telling the people that you were
getting a bit out of hand. He said
the American people weren't getting
a square deal from you. Then he
waved a little red flag.
He finished up his little speech in
grand style. It went something like
this:
"We Americans can't stand any
more of this here Hitler's stuff.
Pretty soon he's going too far. Then
we'll climb into the war and cram
everything back down his throat."
But here's the thing, Adc. You
may be taking two hundred mil
lions of American money when
you take over Norway and Den
mark. Still, you'll have to do a
iot more than that before you ex
pect me to pick up a gun and
light.
Now don't, get me wrong, Fueh
rer. Don't think I figure we can't
jump in there and lick you. That's
happened once before and it can
happen again.
You have to figure us American
people differently this time. We
read too many press notices in 1917
and we jumped in there half
cocked. This time it's going to be
run differently.
* * *
WE' RE going to be the first ones
to head for Berlin if something
important happens. But these people
who hire a brass band and try to get
us excited over a few dollars in
Norway and Denmark are going to
have a tough time.
As far as I'm concerned you can
keep my two or three shares of
stock. You can even use them to
paper your walls. But don't expect
me to come running over after you.
Maybe I'm the only capitalist who
feels like this. But there are lots of
other people who feel that their
pretty pink and white stocks are
G.W.T.W. And they'll let them go,
too.
After all, remember the saying
about the ill wind? Maybe these
stocks will be blowing back some
day.
Lovingly,
History 1940
P.S.: I've got a big bunch of Ger
man stamps. When I totaled up the
value they amounted to well up in
the trillions of marks. Maybe we
can figure out a trade.

in the city the other
day was up on a soapbox. He
was telling the people that you were
getting a bit out of hand. He said
the American people weren't getting
a square deal from you. Then he
waved a little red flag.
He finished up his little speech in
grand style. It went something like
this:
"We Americans can't stand any
more of this here Hitler's stuff.
Pretty soon he's going too far. Then
we'll climb into the war and cram
everything back down his throat."
But here's the thing, Adc. You
may be taking two hundred mil
lions of American money when
you take over Norway and Den
mark. Still, you'll have to do a
iot more than that before you ex
pect me to pick up a gun and
light.
Now don't, get me wrong, Fueh
rer. Don't think I figure we can't
jump in there and lick you. That's
happened once before and it can
happen again.
You have to figure us American
people differently this time. We
read too many press notices in 1917
and we jumped in there half
cocked. This time it's going to be
run differently.
* * *
WE' RE going to be the first ones
to head for Berlin if something
important happens. But these people
who hire a brass band and try to get
us excited over a few dollars in
Norway and Denmark are going to
have a tough time.
As far as I'm concerned you can
keep my two or three shares of
stock. You can even use them to
paper your walls. But don't expect
me to come running over after you.
Maybe I'm the only capitalist who
feels like this. But there are lots of
other people who feel that their
pretty pink and white stocks are
G.W.T.W. And they'll let them go,
too.
After all, remember the saying
about the ill wind? Maybe these
stocks will be blowing back some
day.

and we jumped in there half
cocked. This time it's going to be
run differently.

WE' RE going to be the first ones
to head for Berlin if something
important happens. But these people
who hire a brass band and try to get
us excited over a few dollars in
Norway and Denmark are going to
have a tough time.
As far as I'm concerned you can
keep my two or three shares of
stock. You can even use them to
paper your walls. But don't expect
me to come running over after you.
Maybe I'm the only capitalist who
feels like this. But there are lots of
other people who feel that their
pretty pink and white stocks are
G.W.T.W. And they'll let them go,
too.
After all, remember the saying
about the ill wind? Maybe these
stocks will be blowing back some
day.
Lovingly,

P.S.: I've got a big bunch of Ger
man stamps. When I totaled up the
value they amounted to well up in
the trillions of marks. Maybe we
can figure out a trade.
