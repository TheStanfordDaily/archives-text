# Program Change Deadline Monday
## 
### 
Monday is the last day study lists
may be changed without petitioning
the Registration Committee and
paying a fine. All program changes
made since registration must be
filed at the Registrar's office on the
regular revised study-list cards.
Students are held responsible for
courses and units as they appear on
their official study-lists filed at the
time of registration, and no credit is
given for courses that do not appear
there. This rule applies to physical
education as well as academic sub
jects.
After Monday all program revi
sions must be made by petition to
the Registration Committee, subject
to a $2 fine for each course added
or dropped, or $3 when one course
is substituted for another.
