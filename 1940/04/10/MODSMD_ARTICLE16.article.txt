# Final Series Concert Tonight Presents Symphony and Stern
## 
### 
Bringing to a climax Stanford's l!>:{!)-4() concert season tonight, the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra with guest soloist Isaac Stern will present
a concert particularly chosen for a Stanford audience.
At 8:15 o'clock Memorial Hall's curtain will rise and the orchestra will
open with Beethoven's second overture to his only opera, "Fidclio," known
«as "Lconore No. 3."

This will be followed by the fea
ture of the program, Tschaikowsky's
"Concerto for Violin and Orchestra
in D Major," in three movements,
presenting the soloist Isaac Stern.
This selection is one originally con
sidered too difficult to play on the
violin, but the young concert vio
linist is said to give a masterful
rendition of the concerto.
DEBUSSY NOCTURNES
Pierre Monteux, who is famed
both in this country and in Europe
for his symphonic interpretations of
modern composers, will direct the
orchestra in two of Debussy's best,
known Nocturnes, "Clouds" and
"Festivals."
Jan Sibelius' famous nationally
inspired tone poem, "Finlandia," will
be presented. During the war, this
piece was banned in Finland be
cause of its moving qualities.
The field of opera will be repre
sented by a selection from Wag
ner's "Tristan und Isolde" — the
"Prelude and Love Death." In this
selection all the major themes of
Wagner's greatest music drama arc
synthesized. Originally two sepa
rate pieces, it has been combined for
concert performance.
POPULAR CONCLUSION
Concluding the program with a
popular note, Mr. Monteux will pre
sent one of Johann Strauss' most
typical and beautiful waltzes, "Tales
from the Vienna Woods."
Though all tickets for the concert
have been sold, a few might be on
sale at the box office tonight if
turned in by those not attending.
Concert Manager John Collins urged
all who are not planning to use
their tickets to turn them in at the
Concert Series office today or at the
box office before the performance.
