# â€˜Science Not Human,' Says DeSantillana
## Italian Philosopher Lectures on History Of Science and Art 
### 
"It is the artist who is the inter
mediary of nature; it is not the sei- I
enlist," said George de Santillana i
describing Renaissance philosophy in |
his lecture on the history of science J
last night for the Tuesday Evening |
Series.
To illustrate this basic difference,
he discussed Leonardo da Vinci's [
engineering genius as a part of his j
art,
"He does not think of the utility |
of the flying machine; he thinks of j
breaking the ancient taboo."
LEFT OUT DETAILS
Dr. de Santillana quoted from the j
writings of da Vinci who did not |
put all the details into his diagrams,
"because with such a machine I J
know just what man would do. With j
such a machine man could rain death !
from the skies."
"Today there is no artistic inter- j
pretation in science. I'd say science j
i.s getting more and more inhuman
as it gets more precise," Dr. de San- J
till ana stated.
SCIENTISTS ISOLATED
"Science is now made up of iso- !
la ted technicians, isolated from so
ciety, isolated among themselves," i
according to Dr. de Santillana's dif- i
ferentiation between modern and j
Renaissance views.
Dr. de Santillana pointed out one j
contribution of the Renaissance to |
government techniques, in "the idea
that nothing is impossible," which
he said is now called Blitzkrieg.
RENAISSANCE INFLUENCE
That "the artist was attempting a
construction that was valid for all
men," was contrasted by Dr. de San
tillana with the modern artist's idea
that "art is what you like and no
one else likes." This viewpoint of a
quest for truth is the one held by
research workers today, he said.
"This attitude of geographic emi
nence made the Italy of da Vinci a
"turbid Hood," that made possible
many later developments, the lec
turer explained. Of modern progress
that grew from this, he said, "We are
children of the Renaissance. The
Renaissance was the beginning of
all our mistakes, but after all so is
birth."

birth."
"It is the artist who is the inter
mediary of nature; it is not the sei- I
enlist," said George de Santillana i
describing Renaissance philosophy in |
his lecture on the history of science J
last night for the Tuesday Evening |
Series.
To illustrate this basic difference,
he discussed Leonardo da Vinci's [
engineering genius as a part of his j
art,
"He does not think of the utility |
of the flying machine; he thinks of j
breaking the ancient taboo."
LEFT OUT DETAILS
Dr. de Santillana quoted from the j
writings of da Vinci who did not |
put all the details into his diagrams,
"because with such a machine I J
know just what man would do. With j
such a machine man could rain death !
from the skies."
"Today there is no artistic inter- j
pretation in science. I'd say science j
i.s getting more and more inhuman
as it gets more precise," Dr. de San- J
till ana stated.
SCIENTISTS ISOLATED
"Science is now made up of iso- !
la ted technicians, isolated from so
ciety, isolated among themselves," i
according to Dr. de Santillana's dif- i
ferentiation between modern and j
Renaissance views.
Dr. de Santillana pointed out one j
contribution of the Renaissance to |
government techniques, in "the idea
that nothing is impossible," which
he said is now called Blitzkrieg.
RENAISSANCE INFLUENCE
That "the artist was attempting a
construction that was valid for all
men," was contrasted by Dr. de San
tillana with the modern artist's idea
that "art is what you like and no
one else likes." This viewpoint of a
quest for truth is the one held by
research workers today, he said.
"This attitude of geographic emi
nence made the Italy of da Vinci a
"turbid Hood," that made possible
many later developments, the lec
turer explained. Of modern progress
that grew from this, he said, "We are
children of the Renaissance. The
Renaissance was the beginning of
all our mistakes, but after all so is
birth."
