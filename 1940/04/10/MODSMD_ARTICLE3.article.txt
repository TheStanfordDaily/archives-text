# Britain, France Struggle To Break German Grasp On Norwegian Coastline
## Norse, Allies Battle Nazi Airmada; Hitler 'Strengthens Protection’ As 1500 Troops Die in Warship Plunge 
### 
STOCKHOLM, April 9 (UP). —Allied and German warships and planes
fought bitter battles along the German-held coasts of Norway tonight as
Great Britain and France struggled to break the grip of Chancellor Adolf
Hitler's "protective" occupation of Norway and Denmark.
The German high command announced by radio that Nazi planes had
"badly damaged" four British and French warships—two battleships and

two heavy cruisers—in a battle
the Norwegian port of Bergen. The i
British said they were only "slightly
damaged."

Scandinavian wireless reports said
the 26.000-ton German battleship
Gnelsenau was sunk in the Skager
rak with 1,500 of her crew and an
other Nazi warship went down in
Oslo Fjord, presumably under the
guns of Norwegian batteries.
SWIFT DEVELOPMENTS
Germany's lightning invasion of
Denmark and Norway in retaliation
for the Allies' mining of Norwegian
territorial waters along the lifeline
of the Reich's iron ore shipments
brought these developments:
1. The Norwegian government of
Premier Johan Nygaardsvold re
signed, after fleeing from Oslo, and
Vidlcun Quisling of the anti-Com
munist and Nazi-type National Un
ion party proclaimed himself pre
mier by radio with the statement
that Germany's occupation was "sal
vation from the Allies' frightful act
of force."
2. The German high command an
nounced occupation of all Norwegian
points of "military importance" at
nightfall, including airdromes and
naval centers.
NAZIS PLANT MINES
3. The German navy mined the
entrances to the Atlantic ports, pre
sumably to prevent any attempted
landing by Allied forces from the
sea, and offered pilot service to Nor
wegian shipping.
The Norwegian army was reported
to be throwing up a new defense
line between Oslo and Hamar, to
which the government and the royal
family fled before German cavalry
and machine-gunners marched into
Oslo. Hamar is GO miles north of
Oslo.
CONTROL STRAITS
5. German armed forces, includ
ing planes, pushed through unre
sisting Denmark to Aalberg on the
Skagerrak to control both sides of
the 50-mile-wide straits between the
North Sea and the Baltic.
6. Premier Stauning of Denmark,
appealing to the Germans by radio
to respect Danish lives, said members
of the opposition would be brought
into the government—a possible ref
erence to the Nazis.
7. The Swcdish-Amerika Line ship
Amasis was reported to have been
sunk at 5 p.m. by a British submarine
while en route to Oslo through the
Skagerrak from Germany's Baltic
port of Stettin.
8. Sweden, fearing that the war
may be brought to her territories
next, received a note from Germany
demanding "strict neutrality" and
replied with a statement that she is
determined to fight, if necessary to
maintain her integrity against any
power. Germany denied the re
ported threat.
