# Cards to Meet Broncs
## Claude Purkitt To Take Mound For Indian Nine 
### 
Still trying to cop their first series
of the current league season, the
Stanford nine go to bat again to
morrow afternoon at 3:15 o'clock in
the Sunken Diamond against the
Santa Clara Broncos.
Claude Purkitt will be on the
mound for the Cards as they at
tempt a quick comeback following
their 3-2 defeat by U.C.L.A. Mon
day. Santa Clara's starting flinger
will probably be either Lefty Collins
or Russ Lebeck.
'I lie Indians will be fighting, for
the victory which will partially
drag them ouit of last place in the
league baseball standings. They are
credited with three victories as
against seven defeats, while U. C.
L. A., in next to last place, has
lour wins and six losses. A win to
day would leave Stanford only one
half a game behind the Bruins.
DECIDES SERIES
In the last Card-Bronc meeting on
the diamond, Stanford, with "Cootie"
Thomptfm pitching, squeezed out a
2-1 victory to even the count with
their rivals from down the penin
sula. Earlier in the season Santa
Clara copped the first game of the
series. Thus the victor in today's
game will be the series winner as
well.
Claude Purkitt will be trying for
his first win in conference compe
tition this year, a victory which he
really deserves. Against Gaddini's
All-Stars last Saturday, "Purk," al
though he pitched only two innings,
was given credit for the win. Of the
four twiilers who worked the game,
he was the only one to pitch no-hit
ball.
The Indians are still in a pinch
for a slugging right fielder and a
catcher who can hit at least once in
a while. None of the Card right
fielders has smacked out a good solid
bingle lor so long that few remem
ber just when it happened last.
BOONE IN FORM
In the catching spot it's a question
of offensive power vs. defensive
strength. Sid Lewis showed by his
single as a pinch-hitter Monday that
he can hit. but he is outclassed as a
catcher by little Herb Atkinson,
who is having his troubles at the
plate. A third catcher, Jack Ran
dall, is also lacking in hitting
power.
A favorable sign for the Wolter
men, however, is the return to hit
ting form of Elton Boone, Stanford's
peppery third sacker, who has col
lected four hits, one of them a
double, in his last eight trips to the
plate.
Aside from the questionable right
field and catching spots, the Cards'
starting line-up is fairly well set
with Hal Costello at first, Harry Par
sons at second, Monte Pi'yl at short,
Boone at third, Norm Juney in left
field, and Alec Cereghino in center
field.
