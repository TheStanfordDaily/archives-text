FARM IHTLESS
WONDERS—SOMETIMES
To borrow a phrase from Mr.
Fields, he of the crimson beak,
"There's t an Ethiopian in the fuel
supply."
In the person of one Quentin
"Cootie" Thompson Stanford has
the greatest college pitcher to per
form on C.1.8.A. diamonds since Joe
Gonzales was on the firing line for
Sam Barry's Trojans five years ago.
j Monday Cootie turned in the best
! pitched game seen on the Sunken
! Diamond for many a day, limiting
U.C.L.A. to one hit, yet the Bruins
won, 3-2, and shoved the Cards
deeper into the cellar.
Thompson has been consistently
stung with base hits. The big right
hander has hurled six full games
(his season, and in none of them
did he yield more than five safe
ties. He's a cinch to cop league
honors in the earned-run depart
ment with a figure around 1.5 per
nine-inning game, yet he's been
charged wtih the defeat in three of
the six contests he worked be
cause of spotty defensive play and
the repeated failure of hitters to
come through in the pinch.
Batting averages of the Farm
regulars would look like a weight
chart for a bunch of midgets, but
the whole story doesn't lie there.
College baseball scores often re
semble the half time tally of a bas
ketball game, but not once this year,
in league competition, has Harry
Wolter's nine scored more than
half a dozen runs.
And strangely enougn, the first
guy to land on my neck when he
sees this will be—Cootie Thompson.
MR. SHAUGHNESSY
TAKES OVER
There's a minor revolution taking
place on the Farm these days. About
40 men who probably haven't played
lootball since high school days are
playing hookey from Lake Lagunita
three days a week to attend spring
grid practice.
No more than ."jft of the huskies
working out under Head Coach
Clark Shaughnessy are holdovers
from last fall's varsity and frosh
squads, the rest have given up
their usual spring quarter pursuits
to try and win a position on the

1 !>4l Indian varsity.
Whether these hopefuls stick or
i not depends entirely on themselves,
j With six assistants on hand to help
| Coach Shaughnessy round the squad
! into shape, there's little chance that
anyone who shows ability will be
! passed up. In addition to the posi-
I tions on the varsity, the revival of
| the Stanford Grays offers an oppor
j tunity for these men to work up to
the first squad.

(Editor's Note: With Frank
Guthrie in the rest home. Assist
ant Sports Editor Jerry Brucker
takes over Slants for a day or so.)
