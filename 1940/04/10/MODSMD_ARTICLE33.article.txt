# Farm Tennis Men Pin Hopes on Dee
## 
### 
Traveling to Berkeley tomorrow,
the Stanford varsity netmen will
face the California tennis stars in a
battle for second spot in the con
ference race. The match is sched
uled for 2 o'clock on the California
courts.
Coach Sherman Lockwood has
said that the match is a toss-up but
that he is hoping for a victory. Most
of Stanford's hopes lie on the shoul
ders ol Larry Dee, sophomore num
ber one man.
Dee is counted upon to defeat
either Bob Harmon or Bob Peacock
whichever Cal man plays first. Then
he teams with Jimmy Wade to try
and upset Cal's number one doubles
team. Harmon and Peacock. These
two wins are almost essential for a
Stanford victory.
