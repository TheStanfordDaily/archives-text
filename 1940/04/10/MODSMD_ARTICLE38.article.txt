# Relay Team Aims at New World Mark
## 
### 
Four flying Cardinal trackmen
may make a coach's dream come
tiue this Saturday. The coach Ls
Bill Ellington, Stanford's "filler
inner" as track mentor.
The four Cards are Charlie Shaw,
Ernie Clark, Craig Williamson, and
Clyde Jeffrey, Stanford's mile relay
team in that order, and the occasion
will be a determined onslaught on
the world's mile relay record.
Though Ellington's one-year stand
has already produced a tied record
in the 100-yard dash by Jeffrey and
a new intercollegiate mark in the
two-mile relay, this race Saturday
could eclipse any of these others
with its brilliance.
The world record stands now at
3:11.6, but these four Indians are po
tentially a second better than this
mark. Clark has run 48 flat this
season; Williamson 47.7, Shaw 47.4,
and Jeffrey 47.4, which all adds up to
a phenomenal 3:10.5.
NO UCLA COMPETITION
The only hitch in Saturday's set
up is the fact that the competition
ottered by U.C.L.A.'s Bruins will be
practically nil. Now Clark and Wil
liamson are pretty consistent at their
best marks, and are improving daily
with or without competition. But
Shaw and Jeffrey are definitely pres
sure runners and accomplish their
best only when somebody can be
heard pounding behind them.
Yet even without this usually
necessary incentive, the Indians
have a strong chance of putting to
gether their best efforts and bring
ing home a new world's record. In
the first place they have been point
ing for this Saturday's race a long
time. Also, every man except Jef
frey, who will ease through a 100-
yard dash to warm up a bit, will not
have run any race that day until
relay time.
SATURDAY'S TREAT
World records aren't broken ev
ery day and this Saturday, with
ideal weather conditions, Stanford
track fans may be given the treat of
their lives, seeing their team break
one.
The only other thing of interest
to the fans will be the continued
improvement of the Indian team in
general and of the jumpers and put
ters in particular. For if they are
to beat U.S.C.'s mighty horde, El
lington's charges will have to raise
their sights in most of the field
events.
ELLINGTON HOPES
Ellington is hoping that A1 Grey
and Bill Trout will start flirting with
50 feet in the shot as they did last
year. He hopes that Stan Andersen
and Emerson Hiler will add a few
feet to their bests in the discuss.
Thor Peterson could easily break
into the 23-foot mark in the broad
jump and Ray Brown might get
back to his earlier season form.

a phenomenal 3:10.5.
NO UCLA COMPETITION
The only hitch in Saturday's set
up is the fact that the competition
ottered by U.C.L.A.'s Bruins will be
practically nil. Now Clark and Wil
liamson are pretty consistent at their
best marks, and are improving daily
with or without competition. But
Shaw and Jeffrey are definitely pres
sure runners and accomplish their
best only when somebody can be
heard pounding behind them.
Yet even without this usually
necessary incentive, the Indians
have a strong chance of putting to
gether their best efforts and bring
ing home a new world's record. In
the first place they have been point
ing for this Saturday's race a long
time. Also, every man except Jef
frey, who will ease through a 100-
yard dash to warm up a bit, will not
have run any race that day until
relay time.
SATURDAY'S TREAT
World records aren't broken ev
ery day and this Saturday, with
ideal weather conditions, Stanford
track fans may be given the treat of
their lives, seeing their team break
one.
The only other thing of interest
to the fans will be the continued
improvement of the Indian team in
general and of the jumpers and put
ters in particular. For if they are
to beat U.S.C.'s mighty horde, El
lington's charges will have to raise
their sights in most of the field
events.
ELLINGTON HOPES
Ellington is hoping that A1 Grey
and Bill Trout will start flirting with
50 feet in the shot as they did last
year. He hopes that Stan Andersen
and Emerson Hiler will add a few
feet to their bests in the discuss.
Thor Peterson could easily break
into the 23-foot mark in the broad
jump and Ray Brown might get
back to his earlier season form.
Four flying Cardinal trackmen
may make a coach's dream come
tiue this Saturday. The coach Ls
Bill Ellington, Stanford's "filler
inner" as track mentor.
The four Cards are Charlie Shaw,
Ernie Clark, Craig Williamson, and
Clyde Jeffrey, Stanford's mile relay
team in that order, and the occasion
will be a determined onslaught on
the world's mile relay record.
Though Ellington's one-year stand
has already produced a tied record
in the 100-yard dash by Jeffrey and
a new intercollegiate mark in the
two-mile relay, this race Saturday
could eclipse any of these others
with its brilliance.
The world record stands now at
3:11.6, but these four Indians are po
tentially a second better than this
mark. Clark has run 48 flat this
season; Williamson 47.7, Shaw 47.4,
and Jeffrey 47.4, which all adds up to
a phenomenal 3:10.5.
