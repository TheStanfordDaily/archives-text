## 
### 
Swede Johanscn, big tackle, became tho first casualty of the spring
Straining season yesterday on the varsity practice field when he came
up with a minor leg injury. Johanscn should he ready to hear down
again today or Friday.
The whole squad showed improvement in mastering the plays Coach

Shaughnessy luts given them tc,
I work on. Almost half the session
was spent with the club broken up
into four groups of two teams each
; running through plays.
Frankie Albert, Pete Kmetovic,
Hugh Gallarneau and Norm Stand
lee make up the "A" backfield at
this early date. Albert, a left half
] last fall, has been moved to quarter
in the new set-up, with Kmetovic
i at left half, Gallarneau at right half,
j and Standlee at fullback.
In the formations that have been
| used so far, Albert takes the ball
j from center on every play, giving it
to one of the other three backs.
The first half of yesterday's ses
sion was spent working on funda
| mentals, with the squad split into
; five groups. Phil Bertgston and Har
ry Shipkey handled the linemen in
one bunch, concentrating on block
ing the dummies. Jim Lawson tu-
I tored the wingmen.
The backs were split into three
groups, working on passing under
Marchy Schwartz, on ball handling
j under Bernie Masterson, and on
kicking and receiving punts under
i Iluskv Hunt.
