# Into the Foaming Brine

EX COMMITTEE does not like to sunbathe.
Because the paltry sum of eighty-four dol
lars seemed too much of ail investment for the
actual completion of Stanford's quasi-finished
Boathouse, our highest assembly last night ve
toed a plan whereby the north deck of their
own monument to spring quarter foolishness
would have been converted into a second sun
porch. Under their dicta, the north deck will
continue to be nothing more than a plain old
tar and gravel roof.
This ignominious fate is not exactly a com
pliment to the committee's foresight in their
original budgeting of the sun and water plant.
Certainly if the hastily and expensively built
Boathouse was worth the first cost of close to
ten thousand dollars, the additional expenditure
of less than a hundredth of that amount is jus
tified.
No one denies that the work will have to be
done sooner or later anyway, possibly next
spring, or maybe when an overload on the
south end tips the committee's pride and joy
into the murky brine. Stranger things have
happened on old Lagunita.
Even the addition of a practically costless
floor, for sight-seeing purposes, with no soft
cushions or rainbow-colored mattresses, would
be better than nothing at all. It's a matter of
investing ten thousand dollars and getting re
turns from only half of that amount.
Certainly the safety precautions provided as
well as additional spectator and relaxing space
is worth an appeal in The Daily. If it were a
campaign we wanted or more news stories, we
would need only turn to Europe and Washing
ton where strange things are happening with
amazing regularity.
But sun-bathing is more fun.
