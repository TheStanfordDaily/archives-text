# Cruel, Cruel Woild

is so broadening" ... it gives all
of us an opportunity to delay specializ
ing in anything, and employers love it in terms
of diplomas. But when we go to apply for the
position we want, and the next week when we
are looking for a job, it won't be all about
Aeschylus and Cimabue that fills in the records.
The employer, permeated as he is with the prac
ticality of the cruel world, will ask even the
five-year men and women how well they can
do the job he has to offer; and why.
Technical training in education is the obvious
answer to this; therefore the trend of late has
been toward vocational and specialized techni
cal training in trades and industries as well as
professions in all schools.
That picture looks complete. But employers
don't like the kind of technical training provided
by schools. Mrs. Roosevelt pointed that out
Monday night, and she got her informaion from
Owen D. Young who is responsible for that
sort of thing on a national scale. More funda
mental even than this discrepancy is the lag in
education as a preparation for our economic
and social living. This lag is from 6 to 20 years
according to surveys guoted by Dr. Hand of
Stanford's school of education.
While our elders quibble over what we shall
be taught, it seems left for us to do a little
learning—just to bridge the gap.—M. J. M.
