# CAMPUS OPINION
## LOOK â€™EM OVER 
### 
r rilE EDITOR. SIR:
Since the Rate is open and the sky is the limit
how about a "lockout system for the men's living
quarters"?
Since Dean Bunn has admitted the administration's
predilection to discipline, why not go "the whole hog"
and follow in the footsteps of some of our Eastern
constituents?
It's true that when our men enroll they are sup
posed to be beyond the need of discipline; but are
they? It might make an interesting project to find
the correlation between the maladministration of free
time and failure in studies. Certainly the maintenance
of regular hours, that is a drawing of the line in regard
to staggering in at 3 o'clock in the morning. Even a
study table might not be out of place. If the women of
this school can exist under such a paternalistic sys
tem and profit from it, as we so proudly claim, why
can't the men?
At least il would prevent a lot of "the oil-campus

varieties" and furthermore it might save some of the
ugly rich a little of their father's dough.
Despite their "sophistication" the sons of Stanford
are not old enough to conduct themselves without
adult restraint.
