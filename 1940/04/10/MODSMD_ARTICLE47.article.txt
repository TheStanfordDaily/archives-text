# CLEAN EARS

r EDITOR, SIR:
Several of us Eneina men were discussing Mr.
Dunn's House Mother idea. We agree heartily with
Mr. Dunn on this plan, only we feel that he is starting
in the wrong place. We believe that the freshmen at
Encina are much more in need of a mother than those
who have been here more than a year.
We are just children, not yet used to college life,
and we miss our mothers constantly. We feel that a
mother in each corridor of our hall would do wonders
with the boys. She would undoubtedly make us study
more, and we would feel that Encina was a home and
we would spend less time at various places along the
highway. She would get us home from our dates at a
reasonable hour, and tuck every boy in bed by ten
thirty.
No longer would the men at Encina be a bunch of
rowdies; under the influence of a Corridor Mother we
would be happy, smiling, punctual children, scrubbed
clean behind the ears. Then when we went to live at
a fraternity we would expect and feel the need of
House Mothers.
Of course for the Hallmen there would have to be
mothers at Toyon, Dranner, and Sequoia, or they
would be much too rowdy for the mothered Row-boys
to associate with. Dut we leave for our Dean the solu
tion to the problem of what we would do for mothers
after we graduated.
