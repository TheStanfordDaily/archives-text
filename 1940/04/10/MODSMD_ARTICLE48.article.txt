# BULL SESSION

### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
SENATOR VANDENBERG AND PAUL McNUTT
yt/ASHINGTON, D.C.—Senator Vandenberg had just
delivered a speech to the Senate, a tirade against
the Democrats. But he came out to the reception room
as relaxed as a cool golfei - , with one quarter of a cigar
moving easily between his teeth.
"We wanted to meet the next President of the
United States," we began, with a tell-tale smile.
"God preserve me from that," was the Senator's
comment. And he acted as though he meant it. "Peo
ple think .1 took a drubbing in those Wisconsin pri
maries. But as a matter of fact I didn't know one
candidate for the Wisconsin delegation. Those boys
don't bother me!"
"How about the southerners," we asked, "don't they
bother you, Senator? The Democratic party is a re
ligion down there."
"Boys," Vandenberg said with a chew on his cigar,
"Jesus Christ has to stay up nights to stay ahead of
the Democrats down South."
But even the relative security of his arch-foes
south of the Mason-Dixon line didn't seem to cause
Michigan's favorite son any great nervousness or
alarm. The game he is playing—politics—is too un
predictable to worry about, says Vandenberg. Every
thing is left to the campaign managers, everything but
orations. And everything includes worry.

T HE
same easy politician's cheer characterized the
Democrats' Adonis, Federal Securities Administra
tor Paul McNutt. Indiana's ex-governor is, in fact, even
more the genial politician than is Vandenberg. He
looks like Hollywood's conception of a silver-haired
mogul—a sort of bank-president-looking giant with
cigarette-smoking self-possession. As is the custom
with Democratic leaders these days, the Governor ide
alizes Roosevelt's power and popularity. On his desk
he has a big picture of F.D.R. which is inscribed, "To
my old friend Governor McNutt, Franklin Roose
velt."
But as to the third term, McNutt, like all the coun
try, is in the dark. "Nobody knows," he said. "But
personally I don't think the President will run again.
He doesn't want to commit himself, because that would
destroy his prestige abroad and his power in Congress."
And whatever Roosevelt's plan may be, he is cer
tainly maintaining his hold on Democratic leadership.
McNutt is not inherently a great New Dealer. But his
statements to the press have always been prefaced with
praise of what Roosevelt has done.
Whatever goes on in their heads or in their cam
paigners' schemes, however, McNutt and Vandenberg
share what most of Washington's feature-actors have:
flexibility and outward calm. Politics is a game for
them. And games should not spoil digestion.

same easy politician's cheer characterized the
Democrats' Adonis, Federal Securities Administra
tor Paul McNutt. Indiana's ex-governor is, in fact, even
more the genial politician than is Vandenberg. He
looks like Hollywood's conception of a silver-haired
mogul—a sort of bank-president-looking giant with
cigarette-smoking self-possession. As is the custom
with Democratic leaders these days, the Governor ide
alizes Roosevelt's power and popularity. On his desk
he has a big picture of F.D.R. which is inscribed, "To
my old friend Governor McNutt, Franklin Roose
velt."
But as to the third term, McNutt, like all the coun
try, is in the dark. "Nobody knows," he said. "But
personally I don't think the President will run again.
He doesn't want to commit himself, because that would
destroy his prestige abroad and his power in Congress."
And whatever Roosevelt's plan may be, he is cer
tainly maintaining his hold on Democratic leadership.
McNutt is not inherently a great New Dealer. But his
statements to the press have always been prefaced with
praise of what Roosevelt has done.
Whatever goes on in their heads or in their cam
paigners' schemes, however, McNutt and Vandenberg
share what most of Washington's feature-actors have:
flexibility and outward calm. Politics is a game for
them. And games should not spoil digestion.
SENATOR VANDENBERG AND PAUL McNUTT
yt/ASHINGTON, D.C.—Senator Vandenberg had just
delivered a speech to the Senate, a tirade against
the Democrats. But he came out to the reception room
as relaxed as a cool golfei - , with one quarter of a cigar
moving easily between his teeth.
"We wanted to meet the next President of the
United States," we began, with a tell-tale smile.
"God preserve me from that," was the Senator's
comment. And he acted as though he meant it. "Peo
ple think .1 took a drubbing in those Wisconsin pri
maries. But as a matter of fact I didn't know one
candidate for the Wisconsin delegation. Those boys
don't bother me!"
"How about the southerners," we asked, "don't they
bother you, Senator? The Democratic party is a re
ligion down there."
"Boys," Vandenberg said with a chew on his cigar,
"Jesus Christ has to stay up nights to stay ahead of
the Democrats down South."
But even the relative security of his arch-foes
south of the Mason-Dixon line didn't seem to cause
Michigan's favorite son any great nervousness or
alarm. The game he is playing—politics—is too un
predictable to worry about, says Vandenberg. Every
thing is left to the campaign managers, everything but
orations. And everything includes worry.
