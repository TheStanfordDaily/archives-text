You can drive out in the hills with her. Sir, but do
not park near a house. You can go with him, Madame,
but do not make any noise. Above all, do not get
stuck in the mud.
Two guys and their females went riding out in the
hills the other night, and they saw a car stuck in the
mud, and a boy and girl out in the road flagging them
down.
They stopped.
"Can you help us? We're stuck."
They hooked a rope between the cars, and began
pulling it out. noisily.
Suddenly a bullet whizzed over their heads. An old
dame came out of the woods carrying a gun.
"Git out!."
They got out.
