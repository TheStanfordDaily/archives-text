# First Novel Wins Acclaim For Young Negro Writer
## 
### 
"NATIVE SON," by Richard
Wright.
If the social novel is to achieve a
position of functional importance in
our culture, it should fulfill two
qualifications. First it ought to re
produce an authentic and convincing
picture of a more or less acute so
cial condition, and it should also
stand up under certain literary
tests.
In style, characterizations, and de
velopment of theme and plot, it
must be at least equal to those works
which deal wtih "nicer" topics than
"social conflict." Mr. Wright's por
trayal of the plight of the American
Negro today possesses the first
quality, in superb fashion; the sec
ond more than adequately, although
there is room for improvement.
WRIGHT'S FIRST
"Native Son" has been hailed as
the 1940 successor to "The Grapes
of Wrath," but the two are not ex
actly parallel cases. "Native Son" is
not so controversial and lacks the
sentimentality which helped sell
Steinbeck's masterpiece. A young
Negro, making his first full-length
literary appearance, Mr. Wright has
presented a courageous, honest, and
first-hand account of the problems
facing the Negro youth today.
Rising from a common Mississippi
Negro family, Wright steps incon
testably into the ranks of Steinbeck,
Dos Passos, Farrell, and Caldwell
with his first novel. Wright has a
certain kiek-in-the-face naturalism
which Steinbeck seems incapable of
attaining, even with his coarsest
dialogues.
NOT FOR THE TIMII)
This harrowing tale is "powerful"
in the true sense of this hackneyed
description. It is not for the faint of
heart. The behavior of a frustrated
Negro youth, for whom our society
seemingly has no place, is not apt to
bring up thoughts of lavender and
old lace.
With no attempt at romanticizing,
the writer draws the central figure
faithfully and makes his behavior
unquestionably authentic under the
circumstances. The plot, though
smacking sometimes of melodrama,
has all the thrills of a good murder
mystery. Two killings, one actual
and one supposed rape (over which
all the usual race prejudice is
aroused), a ransom note, the chase
and capture, and the trial comprise
a drama both "tough" and compel
ling.
PLUMBS NEGRO MIND
Prohibited by law or the stronger
forces of convention and economic
pressure from participating in the
same activities as whites, the Negro's
reactions of frustration are apt to be
violent and counter to our accepted
standards of conduct. This psychol
ogy Wright puts forth vividly and
with a minimum of righteous indig
nation.
As to style, there are some weak
points. Parts of the first third and
the very end of the book are some
times awkward, but this should
easily be remedied in further works.
Some of the characters are not too
convincing, and all except the chief
one are not drawn quite so defi
nitely as they should.
The writer is obviously a "find,"

however, and should rank at or very
near the top among American nov
elists. The book is a prerequisite
for any study of the American
Negro and problem of his assimila
tion. â€”Dalton
