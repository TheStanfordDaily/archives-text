# Excom Refuses New Sun Deck For Boathouse
## Temporary Platform May Be Constructed For Water Carnival 
### 
Stanford's sun bathers were de
nied an additional sun deck at the
Boathouse last night, when Ex Com
mittee refused to authorize the nec
essary expenditure this spring.
Boarding over the roof of the
north wing of the Boathouse would
have constituted the chief expense,
according to the proposal, intro
duced last week by Daily Editor
Arch Jenkins.
Despite this turn-down, however,
spectators at the Junior Water Car
nival possibly will be able to occupy
both roofs instead of crowding the
single deck that has been 'completed.
FINANCES ARGUED
President Ken Cuthbertson said
he would notify the junior class
they may find it feasible to arrange
for temporary platforms for use on
the unfinished roof the day of the
water carnival. These might be ob
tained from Dr. Wilbur or the 8.A.C.,
committeemen suggested.
Opinion of the committee was di
vided as to the need for the new
sun deck.
"Why put more money into it?"
Coline Upshaw said.
"The present deck gets very
crowded spring quarter," Mollie
West suggested.
Burroughs Anderson, chairman of
Men's Council, said he thought there
was no need for the new deck.
MOTIVES QUESTIONED
"There's no need for it. Jenkins
is just trying to make a news story
out of it," he declared.
Two methods of financing the job
were suggested (cost has been esti
mated at $84). They are (1) through
an informal drive or contributions
from living groups, and (2) through
adding this expense to the present
unpaid balance on the Boathouse,
which is $5100.
Cobbs objected to the first method
on grounds it would jeopardize the
Convalescent Home Drive to be held
this quarter.
Cobbs objected to the second
method on grounds the $5100 debt
probably will be "with us for 10
years."
MAYBE NEXT YEAR'
"If we wait until next year, per
haps we can pay for the improve
ment out of operating profit from
canoe rentals," he said.
His motion that action on the mat
ter be deferred until next year was
passed by the committee.
Other Ex Committee business
follows:
YOUTH LEGISLATURE: Ex
Committee accepted a subcommittee
report by John Porter, in which it
was suggested the A.S.S.U. send no
official delegate to the convention of
the California Youth Legislature, to
be held at Los Angeles next Friday
and Saturday.
Porter quoted students and pro
fessors as commending the youth
legislature. They warned, however,
he said, that the charge of Commun
ism has been leveled unjustly at
such groups at times when minority
groups have tried to control their
meetings.

PEACE COUNCIL: Committee
men decided to defer action on the
Co-operative Book Exchange So
ciety's application for two seats on
Peace Council until Cuthbertson
has consulted further with the co
operative. Porter's motion provided
for a telephone vote of Ex Commit
tee later in the week.
Cobbs and Mollic West contended
a place on Peace Council would be
outside the scope of the Book Ex
change Society. Porter suggested
that justification might be found in
the fact that the co-operative pro
gram is national in scope and works
for education and co-operation in
all fields.
NEW RELAYS: Accepting the re
port of its sub-committee (Barney
Ferguson and Jack Harris), the
committee decided against granting
the Block "S" on the basis of the
annual Stanford-Cal relays ini
tiated last March 23.
On the basis of consultation with
Coach Bill Ellington and trackmen,
Ferguson suggested that track
blocks are not difficult to earn, a
good cinderman could enable poorer
ones to get the award, trackmen
might lose interest after winning a
block since the relays are early in
the season, and the awards could not
logically be granted for this meet
and not for the Fresno Relays.
DATES GRANTED: April 11,

litical Union; April 27, Gamma Phi;
May 4, Delts, Betas; May 4, Chap
pie; May 11, A.T.0.; May 18, Dee

The first recognized Allied air-raid
on German territory occurred four
months after the beginning of the
World War.
