# NO WAR FOR FARM Students Vote Entry of U.S. Unlikely
## 
### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
Carrying guns on the battlefield instead of books on the Quad
appears as a remote possibility to most Stanford students.
In a survey conducted by The Stanford Daily, 44 per cent of
the campus believes it "unlikely" the United States will become
involved in the European war, while an additional 32 per cent
feels this country has a 50-50 chance of remaining neutral. One
per cent indicated it is "impossible." Only 16 per cent of the
students answered that our entrance is "probable," 2 per cent,
"sure," and 5 per cent, "didn't know.''
'IF WE ENTER. HOW SOON?'
The question asked of the campus cross-section was, "Regard
less of what you hope, what do you think the chances are that
the United States will be drawn into the war?" A division of this
question is, "If you think the United States will enter the war,
how soon will it be?" which was answered as follows:
Between 1 and 2 years 48% Under 6 months 0%
2 or more years 20% Undecided 16%
6 to 12 months 16%
(Any percentage less than .5 is considered 0.)
A breakdown of the sample according to living groups re
veals the Row, with 50 per cent believing American entrance
unlikely and merely 15 per cent saying war is probable, is much
more optimistic than Hall residents, only 36 per cent of whom
vote "unlikely" while 29 per cent consider intervention "prob
able.'' Independents, students living in private homes, went to
neither extreme in their beliefs.
WOMEN, FOREIGNERS SEE DARK SIDE
Campus women are more pessimistic than the men, as are all
foreign students. All of the latter group who were questioned
predicted that the United States cannot possibly remain out of
the conflict.
An analysis of the cross-section according to classes and
grads presents an unusual general tendency; the upper division
and grads are more optimistic on the war question than the lower
division, and the more advanced the class the less is its fear, as
indicated by the following percentages:
Class Sure Probable 50-50 Unlikely Imp. Undec.
Freshman 0 27 27 46 0 0
Sophomore 0 33 34 21 6 6
Junior 0 17 44 39 0 0
Senior 5 1 35 45 0 14
Grad 3 10 25 59 0 3
These opinions, representative of the student body, were
compiled from an opinion survey of a scientifically prepared
cross-section of the Stanford campus. This survey was conducted
before Germany's invasion of Denmark and Norway; thus, these
developments, which undoubtedly will influence students opin
ions, have not been considered.

recent poll of student opinion conducted by The Daily. Tabula

appears as a remote possibility to most Stanford students.
In a survey conducted by The Stanford Daily, 44 per cent of
the campus believes it "unlikely" the United States will become
involved in the European war, while an additional 32 per cent
feels this country has a 50-50 chance of remaining neutral. One
per cent indicated it is "impossible." Only 16 per cent of the
students answered that our entrance is "probable," 2 per cent,
"sure," and 5 per cent, "didn't know.''
'IF WE ENTER. HOW SOON?'
The question asked of the campus cross-section was, "Regard
less of what you hope, what do you think the chances are that
the United States will be drawn into the war?" A division of this
question is, "If you think the United States will enter the war,
how soon will it be?" which was answered as follows:
Between 1 and 2 years 48% Under 6 months 0%
2 or more years 20% Undecided 16%
6 to 12 months 16%
(Any percentage less than .5 is considered 0.)
A breakdown of the sample according to living groups re
veals the Row, with 50 per cent believing American entrance
unlikely and merely 15 per cent saying war is probable, is much
more optimistic than Hall residents, only 36 per cent of whom
vote "unlikely" while 29 per cent consider intervention "prob
able.'' Independents, students living in private homes, went to
neither extreme in their beliefs.
WOMEN, FOREIGNERS SEE DARK SIDE
Campus women are more pessimistic than the men, as are all
foreign students. All of the latter group who were questioned
predicted that the United States cannot possibly remain out of
the conflict.
An analysis of the cross-section according to classes and
grads presents an unusual general tendency; the upper division
and grads are more optimistic on the war question than the lower
division, and the more advanced the class the less is its fear, as
indicated by the following percentages:
Class Sure Probable 50-50 Unlikely Imp. Undec.
Freshman 0 27 27 46 0 0
Sophomore 0 33 34 21 6 6
Junior 0 17 44 39 0 0
Senior 5 1 35 45 0 14
Grad 3 10 25 59 0 3
These opinions, representative of the student body, were
compiled from an opinion survey of a scientifically prepared
cross-section of the Stanford campus. This survey was conducted
before Germany's invasion of Denmark and Norway; thus, these
developments, which undoubtedly will influence students opin
ions, have not been considered.
(Editor's Note: This is the second in a series of reports on a
recent poll of student opinion conducted by The Daily. Tabula
tions on other subjects will follow in early issues.)
