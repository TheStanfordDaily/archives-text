## 
### 
"He came in with a cold, but he
got a warm greeting."
More than a little surprised was
Brownell Carr, sophomore, when he
arrived at the Men's Rest Home late
yesterday afternoon to recuperate
from a cold, for he immediately was
informed that he had the honor of
being patient No. 2000 during Mrs.
Clifford G. Allen's 4-year reign as
head of the Home and mother to all
Stanford men.
Asked about any celebration or
ceremony held in honor of the event,
Mrs. Allen chuckled. "Well, Brown
ell is just the 2000 th boy, but he
did get some special attention —on
his dinner tray we placed a little
vase with a rose bud in it, and we
gave him some extra ice cream."
Ten other fellows, recuperating
from a variety of ailments, partici
pated in festivities with an extra
helping of ice cream, too, although
patient No. 1999, James McCargar,
was vexed at himself for not waiting
a while before getting sick.
Mrs. Allen thinks nothing of moth
ering 2000 boys. In fact, she says

she will never stop—even after tak
ing care of a million. "All you have
to do," Mrs. Allen explains, "Is
spread your wings a little further."
