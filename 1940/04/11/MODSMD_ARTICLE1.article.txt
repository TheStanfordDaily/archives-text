group of politicos from hiring their
own little brass bands and slipping

During the past three days Mr. A.
American Citizen has been tuned in
on the Scandinavian crisis. The na

be sure, that the campus politico has

on the Farm.
Nevertheless, while news atten
tion has been focused elsewhere,
the national game of politics has
staggered on despite the lack of
an appreciative audience. Politi
cians will he hack on the stage
soon, they fade without the spot
light.
Since the Nebraska and Illinois
primaries the leading man in each
party has been silent. With good
reason. Each already has a com
manding jump in his respective
field.

made President Roosevelt and
