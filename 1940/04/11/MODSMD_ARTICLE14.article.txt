# Powerful Neighbors Bolster Germany's Strategic Position
## 
### WALT STOESSEL 
The strength of Germany in the present war is bolstered by several
important strategic factors besides the Russian alliance. Economic and
geographic considerations have forced the Balkans into friendly relations,
whether they like it or not. Although the Allies are attempting to counter
act German influence—chiefly in Rumania—they are making little actual

headway.
King Carol likes (he idea of Allied
money pouring into Rumania, but he
and his advisers also know that Ger
many and Russia are immediate and
dangerous neighbors, who will an
swer any change in Rumania's pres
ent, attitude by cutting the country
to pieces. The English offers, while
perhaps dazzling, do not blind Carol
to the fact that, while England is far
away, Germany and Russia are aw
fully close. Fear of invasion will
keep the Balkans friendly to Ger
many.
ITALY LINED UP
Italy, on the south of Germany, is
also an ally. This is no more than
a very strong hunch, but I believe
that, if and when Raly goes to war,
she will go in with Germany.
I spent two weeks in Raly shortly
after Christmas, and found that the
pronounced dislike for the German
cause among the people, so marked
last fall, had cooled off a great deal.
The Italian army would not revolt
if Mussolini ordered war against
England, as it appeared they would
have done in October.
R is no exaggeration to say that
Raly is the key to the military situ
ation. Although Italy appears to be
adroitly playing both sides, I be
lieve that when Hitler gives the
word, Mussolini will do as he says.
WESTERN BULWARK
On the west is Germany's Sieg
fried Line which General Gamelin,
comamnder-in-chief of the French
Army, has estimated would take
over 500,000 men to break through.
Germany's position is strong strate
gically. She has enough food and
resources to wait out another two
years.
Her army is superior. The Ger
man air force is now and will con
tinue to be far ahead of the Allied
forces for some time to come. Amer
ican planes help the Allies, but they
will not be present at the front in
sufficient quantities to charge the
ratings for several months.
The present German air force can
be duplicated every seven months
by the German factories, and by next
fall Goering has said that the time
will be down to four months. Ger
many can afford to wait with her
offensive, but 1 doubt if she will.

to pieces. The English offers, while
perhaps dazzling, do not blind Carol
to the fact that, while England is far
away, Germany and Russia are aw
fully close. Fear of invasion will
keep the Balkans friendly to Ger
many.
ITALY LINED UP
Italy, on the south of Germany, is
also an ally. This is no more than
a very strong hunch, but I believe
that, if and when Raly goes to war,
she will go in with Germany.
I spent two weeks in Raly shortly
after Christmas, and found that the
pronounced dislike for the German
cause among the people, so marked
last fall, had cooled off a great deal.
The Italian army would not revolt
if Mussolini ordered war against
England, as it appeared they would
have done in October.
R is no exaggeration to say that
Raly is the key to the military situ
ation. Although Italy appears to be
adroitly playing both sides, I be
lieve that when Hitler gives the
word, Mussolini will do as he says.
WESTERN BULWARK
On the west is Germany's Sieg
fried Line which General Gamelin,
comamnder-in-chief of the French
Army, has estimated would take
over 500,000 men to break through.
Germany's position is strong strate
gically. She has enough food and
resources to wait out another two
years.
Her army is superior. The Ger
man air force is now and will con
tinue to be far ahead of the Allied
forces for some time to come. Amer
ican planes help the Allies, but they
will not be present at the front in
sufficient quantities to charge the
ratings for several months.
The present German air force can
be duplicated every seven months
by the German factories, and by next
fall Goering has said that the time
will be down to four months. Ger
many can afford to wait with her
offensive, but 1 doubt if she will.
(A (bird installment of Stoessel's
first-hand review of European
power politics in the present war
will appear in an early issue.)
The strength of Germany in the present war is bolstered by several
important strategic factors besides the Russian alliance. Economic and
geographic considerations have forced the Balkans into friendly relations,
whether they like it or not. Although the Allies are attempting to counter
act German influence—chiefly in Rumania—they are making little actual

headway.
King Carol likes (he idea of Allied
money pouring into Rumania, but he
and his advisers also know that Ger
many and Russia are immediate and
dangerous neighbors, who will an
swer any change in Rumania's pres
ent, attitude by cutting the country
to pieces. The English offers, while
