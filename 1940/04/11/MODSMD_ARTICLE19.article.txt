# Nazis, British Battle In Major Sea Fight off Norwegian Coast
## Second Jutland Still Undecided; 3 Warships Sink 
### United Press 
The greatest battle of the Eu
ropcan war is being fought in a
vast triangle extending across the
North Sea from the northern coast
of Denmark to Scotland and
northward to the Arctic Ocean
near Narvik and Tromsoe, Nor
way.
British, French and Norwegian
forces are engaged against the Ger
mans. The result of the action —
which rages on land, sea and in
the air—still is in doubt.
It would be premature to say thai
the action will be decisive although
it seems cetrain that it may have a
vital bearing on the final outcome of
the war.
GREAT NAVAL ATTACK
Briefly- what has happened, since
Britain laid mine fields in Norwe
gian coastal waters early this week
in an effort to stop German ship
movements along the Norwegian
coast, is this:
Germany has occupied Denmark
and parts of Norway included most
strategic points on the Norwegian
coast. Britain has struck back with
one of the great naval attacks of
history, has sunk a considerable
number of German ships and has
forced at least a temporary en
trance through German mine fields
into the outer Skagerrak—the broad
sea channel between North Den
mark and South Norway.
Germany has retaliated with mass
air raids on the great shipping cen
ters of the British Isles from the
Firth of Ftfrth to the British naval
base at Scapa Flow.
REPORT BERGEN TAKEN
Allied troops landed from war
ships were reported to have cap
tured the Norwegian Atlantic ports
of Bergen and Trondheim from the
Germans, though Berlin denied
this.
Norway joined the Allies smashing
asaults by sea and air with a burst
of resistance north of Oslo, where
rallying Norwegian trops were re
ported to have driven back German
forces around Elversum, with heavy
numbers of dead and wounded.
King Haakon of Norway was said
to have defied a formal German de
mand a Nazi government be set up
in Norway.
WARSHIPS SUNK
Three or four German warships
and two or three military transports
loaded with Nazi trops were re
ported sunk in the Skagerrak battle,
which continued far into the night
just off the Swedish coast.
The bodies of German soldiers and
sailors were washed up on the shore
around the Swedish town of Goth
enburg.
In the most violent naval fighting
since the World War at least 10 war
ships were sunk, bringing to nearly
20 the number which have gone
down off Norway's coasts in 48
hours.
The day's sinkings, certain to be
increased when the smoke clears
from the Skagerrak battle, num
bered about 25, including seven
German freighters and military sup
plies ships.
The Skagerrak battle continued to
rage at 10 p.m. off the Swedish
coast after the British fleet appeared
to have forced its way through the
80-mile-long Skagerrak between
Norway and Denmark.
