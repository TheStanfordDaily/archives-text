# Lunch Club Hears White Deride East
## Professor Compares Stanford, Princeton, Harvard School Life 
### AUDREY STEELE 
Lunchers rollicked through an
hour of laughs yesterday noon with
Assistant Professor Lynn T. White
acting as good humor man. Sched
uled to compare American Eastern
and Western university life, he nar
rowed his remarks down to Harvard,
Princeton, and Stanford.
Speaking to a capacity crowd in |
the Nilery, Professor White kept the
audience in a constant state of gig
gles as he aptly described the cam
pus life and antics of the "coupon
clipping" heirs of the Ea.st as com
pared with the movements of the
' ainoi phous masses" here.
"The students of the western
schools are victims of a slovenly
.system of teaching the English
language," the history professor
maintained.
EASTERNERS CAN WRITE
"When they teach you to write the j
English language in the East, even (
the most moronic freshman can I
write a logical sentence with the I
proper subject and verb in Harvard
and Princeton. That is more than
even some of the most brilliant stu
dents can do here, some of the
time," he deplored.
The principal difference between
Harvard, Princeton, and Stanford is
that there are no women attending
the first two. Harvard and Prince
lon campus life is a perpetual stag
party.
Professor White pointed out that
less than 10 per cent of the Harvard
and Princeton students come from
public high schools. Most of them
attend special stylized prep schools
that concentrate on cramming their
students with the necessary knowl
edge for passing college entrance ex
aminations.
TWO-SEMESTER YEAR
There are very few transfers at
the two eastern universities. There
is not the shifting of« students as
there is in the West. Harvard and
Princeton work on the two-semes
ter, four class basis and the class
feeling is very strong. There are no
effective summer sessions, since they
are penal institutions for flunkers.
The University of California has
developed a vibrating machine to
shake dirt off sugar beets.
