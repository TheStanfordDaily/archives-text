# Theater Custodian Attends Lights, Late-leaves, Grades
## 
### 
Painted on the door of a little office
facing onto the huge Memorial Hall
workshop is the name, "James J.
Walters, Custodian." But 5 will get
you 50 that you won't find the owner
of the name in that office.
More likely you'll find him*-a
medium-sized man with a purpose
ful walk, dressed in white overalls
with "Jim" emblazoned on the breast
pocket. He circulates around among
the pulleys, half-painted "flats" and
ramps amid a deafening din of ham
mers wielded by the various stu
dents who are working sets for
"Richard III" at present.
SOUP TO NUTS
The title "Custodian," according to
Walters, includes keeping the equip
ment in shape, scheduling times
when the Hall is in use, seeing that
such affairs as the Tuesday Series
and the Biology Lectures do not
take place in total darkness. He
also keeps watch over the building's
heating system, setting up the pub
lic address system, setting up the
stage for the various lecturers and
other folk who use the stage. These
are only a few of the things his
official job includes.
THEATER MOTHER
But these, in themselves, are not
enough to make the name Jimmy
Walters akin to that of the Holy
Ghost among the students who spend
i their time over at the theater. It's

his, what might be called, extra- j
curricular activities which give him
his name and fame among the Speech
and Dramaites.
Walters classifies his custodian j
jobs under the general heading of
"seeing that they don't tear the place
down." Outside of that he is gen
eral friend and counselor to the
budding actor and technician.
"I help build sets on the side, help
the kids work out their technical j
problems, watch out for the girls' j
late leaves when they're rehearsing, j
check the Bawl-out averages of the j
students when they get themselves
parts in plays . .
NO HOUSE MOTHERS •
In .conjunction with the last func
tion, Walters came out flatly against
the plan for fraternity house mothers
and late leaves for men.
"Watching out for them doubles
my work," he said, shooting a side
long glance at a boy in blue jeans
with a couple of hammers sticking
out of his hip pocket.
Jimmy Walters first came to Stan
ford in 1927 when he held down the
post of electrical technician in the
B.A.C. He left Stanford to attend
Sacramento Jaj-see, and then re
turned to the Farm where he worked
on the construction of the Women's
Gym, Lagunita Court, and the The
ater itself.
