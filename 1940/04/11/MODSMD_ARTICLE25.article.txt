# Frosh Trackmen Crush All-stars
## 
### 
Showing unexpected strength in
several events, the freshman track
squad routed die Peninsula All-
Stars last Saturday 76-45 at Angell
Field.
Bud Sherman in the pole vault,
Ed Stamm and Hank Norberg in the
weights, Ed Voss in the high jump,
Bob Smith and Bob Walt in the mid
dle distances turned in outstanding
performances for the Papooses.
Kenny Taix, curly-haired sprinter
from San Jose High, won both the
100 and 220 from Dick Scott, who
is not in the best of shape.
San Mateo J.C.'s powerful Bull
dog cinder squad crushed the frosh
Tuesday in a dual meet.
