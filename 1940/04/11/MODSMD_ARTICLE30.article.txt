# Broncos Take Card Nine; 7-4
## Indians Drop Last of Series With S.C. Men 
### DON SELBY 
A three-hit. two-run rally in the
last hall" of the ninth inning failed
to pull Stanford's baseball ciub
out of the hole yesterday after
noon, so the Santa Clara Broncos
took a 7-4 game and the series
from the Indians.
The game, which lacked twenty
minutes of lasting three hours, was,
lor the most part, a dull affair en
livened only by the few occasions
one or the other team put together
a pair of hits. Through walks and
.i lew hits Stanford put plenty of
men on the bags, but no one could
hit in the clutches, hence not much
scoring for the Indians, aside from
the last canto.
The Woltermen started out like
they meant business, tallying twice
in the first inning in the following
manner: Alec Cereghino walked,
and went to second on McFadden's
error on Harry Parson's bunt. Both
Cards advanced on Elton Boone's
infield out, and, following Juney's
walk, Cereghino scored on a wild
pitch. Monte Piy 1 walked, and Tem
pleton drove in Parsons on an in
fielder's choice, Pfyl being forced
out at second. *
Claude Purkitt, Stanford's start
ing flinger, lasted only one and two
thirds innings, replaced by Russ
Smith when he walked a run in with
two out in the second inning. Smith
fared little better, and was relieved
by Bill Masters in the next inning
after walking three straight batters.
Masters worked the remainder of
the game, allowing five hits, which,
in addition to walks and Norm Ju
ney's error on a fly ball, drove in
.six runs. However, Smith was
charged with the defeat because he
put the winning runs on the bases
by walking three men.
The Cards will play Cal at Berke
ley next Saturday.

a pair of hits. Through walks and
.i lew hits Stanford put plenty of
men on the bags, but no one could
hit in the clutches, hence not much
scoring for the Indians, aside from
the last canto.
The Woltermen started out like
they meant business, tallying twice
in the first inning in the following
manner: Alec Cereghino walked,
and went to second on McFadden's
error on Harry Parson's bunt. Both
Cards advanced on Elton Boone's
infield out, and, following Juney's
walk, Cereghino scored on a wild
pitch. Monte Piy 1 walked, and Tem
pleton drove in Parsons on an in
fielder's choice, Pfyl being forced
out at second. *
Claude Purkitt, Stanford's start
ing flinger, lasted only one and two
thirds innings, replaced by Russ
Smith when he walked a run in with
two out in the second inning. Smith
fared little better, and was relieved
by Bill Masters in the next inning
after walking three straight batters.
Masters worked the remainder of
the game, allowing five hits, which,
in addition to walks and Norm Ju
ney's error on a fly ball, drove in
.six runs. However, Smith was
charged with the defeat because he
put the winning runs on the bases
by walking three men.
The Cards will play Cal at Berke
