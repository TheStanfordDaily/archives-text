# Jeffrey Runs 47.1 Quarter As Cards Prep for Bruins
## 
### 
Led by "Bullet'' Clyde Jeffrey, Stanford's four-man mile relay team
previewed their hoped-for world's record-breaking performance this com
ing Saturday against U.C.L.A.'s Bruins in a practice 440 yesterday
Captain Clyde led Craig Williamson, Charlie Shaw, and Ernie Clark in
this order to the tape in a featured quarter mile in the near record time

of This time by Clyde is the
best in the best in the nation this
year for the 440 and proved that the
husky sprinter can stretch his legs to
the longer race.
A surprise to the fans was that
hair's breadth second place little
Craig Williamson stole from Charlie
Shaw. These two were a full 3
yards behind their flying sprinter
teammate in 47.6 and 47.7. Back
about 6 yards was the fourth mem
ber of the team, Ernie Clark, who
loafed the last 10 yards and was
caught in 48.6.
POSSIBLE RECORD
Add up these four times and you
get a mark for the mile relay which
breaks by .6 of a second the existing
world record set by U.S.C. in 1936.
The Cards can improve even the
mark of 3:11 flat which their four
races yesterday added up to for
three of them will have running
starts on Saturday.
PRESSURE RUNNERS
Jeffrey and Shaw are plainly
pressure runners and run to win.
But Ernie Clark, as he proved when
he ran that 1:20 660-yard run the
other night all alone that he can do
better on his own hook. Ernie likes
to come off the last turn a-flying
and it he has to go out and around
the pack as he did yesterday he is
liable to tie. Saturday he should
have the road all to himself and con
sequently will run better.
Williamson is a veteran at this
distance and ought to be able to do
close to his best, 47.6, any time he
wants. These four times turned in
yesterday, plus the fact that the
runers will all be fresh for the relay,
and are pointing for the record, all

add up to a mighty fine chance for
their success.
Also last, night Mush Girard ran
almost as sensational a race as Jeff
when he pounded out a 4:13.8 mile.
Paul Moore, who is taking things
easy under doctor's orders, paced
Girard through the first three laps,
which were run in 3:07. Then a
mighty tired Mush pushed on by
himself to run the best mile in Stan
ford history, breaking his own pre
vious best by .7 of a second.
