Ah, the mystery which has sur
rounded the Trojan track and field
team, which is supposed to lick all
comers per usual this spring, is now
not a mystery at all. The Daily got
its exchange copy of The Daily Tro
jan yesterday with all the facts and
figures on Dean Cromwell's men
who performed in a practice work
out with the Southern California
Athletic association's all-stars Sat
urday.

BUT THE ARTICLE headlined
with "Wilson's 6:8 high jump high
light's SCA meet," o.ily gives our
Indians a skeleton, because never at
this time in the year (just two weeks
away from the Trojan-Cal meet and
three from the Trojan-Indian "de
cider") do Trojan times and dis
tances stand up to Stanford marks.
In fact. I can almost hear Crom
well moaning clear up here—ex
cept that I. as well as Bill Elling
ton, know better. It's just an old
line. Anyway, if the Indians could
meet the Trojan Saturday instead
of the Bruin, there wouldn't he a
doubt that the Cardinal tracksters
would triumph gloriously. That's
because Cromwell, who believes in
bringing his men around slowly,
never figures his men to do their
best until around the lirst of May.
Stanford meets U.S.C. May 4.

SO WE HAVE Mickey Anderson
running a 9.7 "hundred" and get
ting a second in a 22-second "fur
long." Howard Upton took things
easy in a 49.1 four-forty, while three
Stanford quarter-milers did 47.4,
47.8, and 48.5 Saturday.
Even the great Louie Zamperini.
who still must have an injured
foot, didn't perform up to snuff.
He was edged out by a soph, Lc
roy Weed, in a 4:18.8 mile. Looks
like trouble here.
Ivy Bledsoe and Biewener ran
two nice hurdle races in 14.9 and
15 fiat, but that doesn't equal either
Sid Hayes' or Dick Simpson's 14.6
races. Art Laret came in with a
24.8 low hurdle race, but he'll run
faster—and so will Dick Simpson,
who ran 23.9 last week.

ON THE FIELD the shot putters
are just flirting with 48 feet and
the discus throwers are around 150
feet. However, here's a field where
coming along slowly doesn't help,
and you couldn't possibly go stale.
Practice here makes for improve
ment—so watch Stan Andersen in
the discus—he's around 155 now and
"going up."
Johnny Wilson, who did 6:8, is
way ahead of any of our men. He's

the fellow who jumps with one
shoe on and the other off. Be
sides him the Trojans have a
couple of others who are way up
there in (he ozone.
Their broadjumpers are around 22
feet, so it looks as if it's going to be
a race to see who can improve the
faster, our Brown, Peterson, and
Chambers, or their Bleeker and
Cromwell.
The javelin throwers — they are
even more so ahead of our men.
They have Bob Peoples, and who's
going to beat him this year unless it
is teammate DeGroot?

JACK RICE, a Stanford alumnus
and track enthusiast, has given the
trackmen something to shoot at.
Just after the Cal-Stanford relays,
March 23, he offered to give indi
vidual trophies to any individual or
any team which breaks a world's
record.
That, of course, means Clyde
Jeffrey, who must break either the
9.4 record which he already holds
jointly with Wykoff, and Owens,
or the various relay teams which
Stanford can field—the 410 on up
to the two-mile.
The trophies will amount to $25
per man and only the baton and the
fame will go to the University. So
maybe our mile relay team will be
No. 1 to break a world's record come
Saturday.
The two-mile team already has
received trophies for their intercol
legiate record at Cal; and should
they break the world's record, they'll
just have that inscribed underneath
the former.

HERE'S A STORY about Louie
Zamperini, the flashy Trojan miler,
in the Long" Beach Relays. Louie
had injured his ankle while in the
S. F. Finnish Relief meet and had
reinjured it in N.Y.C. on one of his
numerous flying trips around the
country.
Once after lining up for a race,
Handsome Louie got out of line,
went to his stooge, dragged out his
comb (part of his equipment), and
proceeded to comb his locks. Then
he ran his race. Wouldn't it look
good now if Jeffrey were to hold
things up to comb his hair, or have
a couple of "maids-in-waiting" for
him as he wandered about the oval
waiting lor his race?
