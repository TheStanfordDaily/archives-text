# Democracy
## 
### 
ONE nice thing about the nominating system
at Stanford is the fact that anyone who has
fifteen friends and the necessay units can get
himself on the ballot.
Unlike Los Angeles City College, where the
candidates have been compelled to name their
national party affiliations, Stanford asks nothing,
requires no residence, no scores of names on a
petition. It is a very democratic idea. That is,
it seemed democratic before somebody learned
the meaning of the word caucus. Caucus is a
dangerous term, like sabotage, or lockout.
Every time a group of the boys or girls got
together during the past eight days, they were
headed either for. the Union coke-bar or an
important caucus.
Now all the candidates have been named.
Democracy has taken its course. Most of the
nominees on both Hall and Row slates are lead
ers of certain houses and clubs. As a group
they could represent Stanford as typical Farm
residents. Unfortunately, some extremely good
men have been left off the ballot, preferring
to keep faith with pre-campaign promises of
solidarity to ruining a faction's chance of suc
cess by splitting the vote.
Regardless of the rather underhanded stigma
which has been placed on the caucus, it is and
probably always will be a part of American and
American collegiate politics. We like to call it
representative democracy. That takes care of
the caucus' limitation of membership and opin
ion. Every group adhering to the caucus has
delegates, who in turn are supposed to speak
for that group. Nine times out of ten the repre
sentatives are dictators or bosses of their own
groups.
This is naturally good, sound American de
mocracy. We need little bosses and some big
bosses to insure the perpetuation of the group
in power.
But some people still don't like the system;
so Stanford has provided an easy means where
by anyone with the aforementioned fifteen
friends or relatives can run for office. Stanford
doesn't care, who splits what ticket or why.
It's one of those guarantees of civil liberties or
something.
And just to show that the system does work
in actual practice, at least two men are going
to run for important offices in the current elec
tion without any caucus backing.

dangerous term, like sabotage, or lockout.
Every time a group of the boys or girls got
together during the past eight days, they were
headed either for. the Union coke-bar or an
important caucus.
Now all the candidates have been named.
Democracy has taken its course. Most of the
nominees on both Hall and Row slates are lead
ers of certain houses and clubs. As a group
they could represent Stanford as typical Farm
residents. Unfortunately, some extremely good
men have been left off the ballot, preferring
to keep faith with pre-campaign promises of
solidarity to ruining a faction's chance of suc
cess by splitting the vote.
Regardless of the rather underhanded stigma
which has been placed on the caucus, it is and
probably always will be a part of American and
American collegiate politics. We like to call it
representative democracy. That takes care of
the caucus' limitation of membership and opin
ion. Every group adhering to the caucus has
delegates, who in turn are supposed to speak
for that group. Nine times out of ten the repre
sentatives are dictators or bosses of their own
groups.
This is naturally good, sound American de
mocracy. We need little bosses and some big
bosses to insure the perpetuation of the group
in power.
But some people still don't like the system;
so Stanford has provided an easy means where
by anyone with the aforementioned fifteen
friends or relatives can run for office. Stanford
doesn't care, who splits what ticket or why.
It's one of those guarantees of civil liberties or
something.
And just to show that the system does work
in actual practice, at least two men are going
to run for important offices in the current elec
tion without any caucus backing.
ONE nice thing about the nominating system
at Stanford is the fact that anyone who has
fifteen friends and the necessay units can get
himself on the ballot.
Unlike Los Angeles City College, where the
candidates have been compelled to name their
national party affiliations, Stanford asks nothing,
requires no residence, no scores of names on a
petition. It is a very democratic idea. That is,
it seemed democratic before somebody learned
the meaning of the word caucus. Caucus is a
dangerous term, like sabotage, or lockout.
