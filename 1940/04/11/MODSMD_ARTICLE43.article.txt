IN Oslo lived a valiant race of people; the
Norwegians. First in democracy, they, from
the wealthy to the poor, lived educated, rich
lives. They co-operated, as in America, to build
a powerful, respected nation. They lived, as
in Switzerland, a life of peace and brotherly
love.
But the Norwegians committed a sin, and the
world found them unfit to live. The Norwegians
were unlucky enough to possess natural re
sources; they committed the sin of prospering.
Prosperity when others wish to be rich, too, is
selfish; prosperity in wartime is fatal.
For both England and Germany knew that if
they were to go on reaching for riches, they
must first protect Norway, each from the other.
Germany, gripped by blockade, desired the
privilege of trading with Norway; because Ger
many (the nation, not the people) had a war
machine to maintain. Great Britain, to preserve
the blockade, could not permit Germany to con
sort *vith Norway; and incidentally needed
Norway's coal and steel herself.
So Norway's trim cities and rich plains were
made her own funeral pyre - she supplied the
body and the fuel. Britain mined her waters;
Germany lost a troopship. Germany landed
troops to keep open the precious flow of raw
materials; Britain pointed her guns at Norway
and Norwegians to protect them from the Ger
mans. The Germans occupied Oslo to protect
Norwegians from the British.
And the British told the Germans to get out
of Oslo, or they'd shell it to pieces.
