# CAMPUS OPINION
## PRO DUKE 
### 
r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
It has come to our eagle eyes that some ancient
museum piece around campus is trying to put the
blocks to swing on the ■Hallowed Stanford Campus."
We don't mind this sort of misinformed flat-arched
Romeo who thinks he's smooth floating around Quad,
but we do resent such a screwball that doesn't know
chalk from cheese blabbing about something which
he, she, or it is unconscious of.
Fletcher Henderson happens to be one of the fathers
of modern music and his name, whether you know it
or not, has been placed on the same plane with Paul
Whiteman. (Ever hear of that so-called "musician")?
What do you think this place is, Daly City Barber
College or the Gallen Kamp Shoe Factory?
No, we're not jitterbugs, and we do appreciate such
TOP rate bands as Glen Miller, T. Dorsey, Fred War
ing. We also have noticed that Chuck Foster and
Harry Owens just jam the record machines around
here with their records.
Your letter rubbed us the wrong way, right from
the start, when you classified such music as being fit
for an immoral and relatively ignorant society. That
is a pure insult to Stanford students and it's a good
thing you didn't sign your letter. It floors us to think
that such a letter could have been dreamed up, and
we do mean dreamed, by an evident upperclassman.
And Lii closing, we would like to ask one question—
did you ever hear of Duke Ellington?
Yours for Better Music
A Couple of Stanford Men
