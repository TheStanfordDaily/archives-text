MR. HUGHES ANI) EIGHT YOUNG MEN
D.C.—The building is the same—
the smooth marble pillars, the square architec
ture, the long terrace of steps, and the court room
heavily draped because of bad acoustics. The situa
tion is the same —a shrewd corporation lawyer bends
confidently over a rostrum and faces the nine highest
jurists in the United States. The plea is an old one—a
cabinet official (Miss Perkins) made demands upon a
steel corporation unauthorized by the government wage
law.
But there are many new faces above the black
robes, on the high judicial bench. Novelty, however,
has not detracted from the dignity of the show. Spec
tators are quiet and tense as the deep-toned southern
dx-awl of the corporation lawyer drives home his point
—courteously, very courteously, but forcefully.
"Your honors," he begins, ''she (Miss Perkins) fixed
the wages (of the Steel Corporation) in accordance
with arbitrary boundaries of prevailing wages, when
she was prevented from doing so by Congress' law and
intent. This fact makes her stipulations illegal . . ."

r JpHE lawyer had glossed over an uncertainty in the
law with vigorous terms. Justice Frankfurter, a
small, delicate-looking man with a soft Bostonian ac
cent, interrupts. "What is fact to which you refer?"
The lawyer realizes what "his honor" is driving at,
but it is too late to withdraw. "Why (cough), the
fact is the word 'locality'."
Frankfurter, still very quiet and reserved: "What
does the word locality mean?"
The lawyer, realizing that the word locality is
poorly defined by the law: "Why (cough, cough), the
word locality means what restriction is meant to be
imposed by the Congress." Justice Frankfurter smiles
broadly. The lawyer hastens to state that he is sure
the word locality does not mean what Miss Perkins
took it to mean.
The lawyer proceeds smoothly and convincingly
until he runs into another indefinite word; he draws
an unwarranted distinction between area and locality.
Chief Justice Hughes leans forward and cocks a white
eyebrow. Justice Douglas smiles. Justice Black in
terrupts with the antithesis of'a Boston accent—a slow
and solid Alabama drawl: "Ah fail to see any real
distinction between the wuhds 'area' and 'locality.'
Can you explain that to the Coht?"
"If your honor please ..."
And so the battle of some of the most brilliant
minds in the countrv proceeds. The spectators may
miss the full significance of the legal technicalities.
But it is impossible to miss the acuteness of the show,
the intentne.ss of the 18 eves that face the suavely
shrewd representative of the Steel Corporation.
Sharp-cutting winds of freedom blow in the Su
preme Court building.
