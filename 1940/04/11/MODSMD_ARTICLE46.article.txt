Joe and the general -were sitting there in that
little hole watching the shells fly by.
"How wouldja like to have a blonde now. chief,"
Joe said.
"Don't like blondes, myself," the general said.
A shell lit near them, digging another hole.
"We can move over there if it gets too cold here,"
Joe said.
"Yeah. I'd rather have a brunette myself."
"All right," Joe said. "I'll take all the blondes, and
you can have the brunettes."

They wiggled out of (lie hole and crawled to
the next shell hole. Empty. They covered about
a mile of hole-coverd country before they gave
up.
Joe look off his shoes and emptied the dirt out
of (hem. "How wouldja like to have a good cigar
now. chief," lie said.
"Don't like cigars, myself," the general said.
"How about a cigarette?"
They got out of the hole and crawled around for
another hour. No cigars. No cigarettes. They sat
down in another hole.
"Where do you think the army is now, general?"
Joe asked.
"Crawl around if you want to," the general said. "I
like it here."
"No, I was just curious."

turned over, and then prodded him with his havo
net.

crawled hack in. Joe said. "Got a case of beer on
