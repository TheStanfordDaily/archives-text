# New Rendition Emotionalizes 'Romeo, Juliet'
## 
### 
"ROMEO AND JULIET," with
Laurence Olivier and Vivien
Leigh, now playing at the Geary
Theater in San Francisco.
It seems that something of a con
troversy is raging over this particu
lar rendition of the bard's great love
story. Of course it is the same bat
tle every time. Ask anybody—Les
lie Howard, Walter Huston, Maurice
Evans—they've all been Elizabethan
bones of contention in their time.
The thing is that everyone inter
prets his Shakespearean characters
differently, and he simply boils if
an actor's interpretation differs from
his own; in the present Geary pres
entation, it's Laurence Olivier who
is bothering the multitudes.
SHOW, LEAD GOOD
Right here and now let me state
that I'm all for Olivier; and I'm also
for the show in general. Thus, the
subsequent analysis will be given
from the favorable angle; those who
object may do so in the adjacent
Campus Opinion column.
What you'll see at the Geary is
two emotional adolescents suffering
the pangs of passionate, unexpected
love. Every effort has been made to
keep the two as near their age as
called for in the play, as possible,
and Mercutio, Benvolio, and Tybalt
are equally young.
HAMLET AWKWARD
The result is that Romeo, hitherto
one of the drama's poorer pieces of
characterization, becomes, in Olivier,
an awkward, near-gauche youngster,
completely emotional, and, not much
of a thinker.
He's the sort of boy who gives
himself over completely to the love
which hits him when he first sees
Juliet and makes pretty much of a
fool of himself at the Capulet party.
Equally violent is the despair which
overtakes him in Friar Lawrence's
cell when he finds he has been
banished.
Olivier, in his attempt to bring out
this idea, has over-emphasized, in
some places, for instance in the bal
let scene and in the Friars' cell. Miss
Leigh is completely the 14-year-old
in love for the first time; but she
cannot be called for over-emphasis.
"Our Scarlett" was fine.
As good, in its way, as the youth
ful interpretation, is the youthful
good looks of the cast. They're
a clear-cut looking bunch — brash
and likeable.
MERCUTIO STRONG
Mercutio, as played by Edmond
O'Brien, is the equal, of both prin
cipals; and his death scene is one of
the best pieces of acting I've ever
seen.
A revolving stage is used to get
quick transition. One point for those
who are considering seeing the show.

keep the two as near their age as
called for in the play, as possible,
and Mercutio, Benvolio, and Tybalt
are equally young.
HAMLET AWKWARD
The result is that Romeo, hitherto
one of the drama's poorer pieces of
characterization, becomes, in Olivier,
an awkward, near-gauche youngster,
completely emotional, and, not much
of a thinker.
He's the sort of boy who gives
himself over completely to the love
which hits him when he first sees
Juliet and makes pretty much of a
fool of himself at the Capulet party.
Equally violent is the despair which
overtakes him in Friar Lawrence's
cell when he finds he has been
banished.
Olivier, in his attempt to bring out
this idea, has over-emphasized, in
some places, for instance in the bal
let scene and in the Friars' cell. Miss
Leigh is completely the 14-year-old
in love for the first time; but she
cannot be called for over-emphasis.
"Our Scarlett" was fine.
As good, in its way, as the youth
ful interpretation, is the youthful
good looks of the cast. They're
a clear-cut looking bunch — brash
and likeable.
MERCUTIO STRONG
Mercutio, as played by Edmond
O'Brien, is the equal, of both prin
cipals; and his death scene is one of
the best pieces of acting I've ever
seen.
A revolving stage is used to get
quick transition. One point for those
who are considering seeing the show.
It starts at 8 o'clock sharp, and it
lasts until 11:30 o'clock.—Nowell
"ROMEO AND JULIET," with
Laurence Olivier and Vivien
Leigh, now playing at the Geary
Theater in San Francisco.
It seems that something of a con
troversy is raging over this particu
lar rendition of the bard's great love
story. Of course it is the same bat
tle every time. Ask anybody—Les
lie Howard, Walter Huston, Maurice
Evans—they've all been Elizabethan
bones of contention in their time.
The thing is that everyone inter
prets his Shakespearean characters
differently, and he simply boils if
an actor's interpretation differs from
his own; in the present Geary pres
entation, it's Laurence Olivier who
is bothering the multitudes.
SHOW, LEAD GOOD
Right here and now let me state
that I'm all for Olivier; and I'm also
for the show in general. Thus, the
subsequent analysis will be given
from the favorable angle; those who
object may do so in the adjacent
Campus Opinion column.
What you'll see at the Geary is
two emotional adolescents suffering
the pangs of passionate, unexpected
love. Every effort has been made to
keep the two as near their age as
called for in the play, as possible,
and Mercutio, Benvolio, and Tybalt
are equally young.
