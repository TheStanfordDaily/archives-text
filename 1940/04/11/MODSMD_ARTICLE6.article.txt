# Jackson Tells Budget Straits
## Comptroller Shows Steady Fee Increase 
### 
The business side of the Stanford
picture was explained briefly by
Acting Comptroller J. Hugh Jack
son last night in an informal talk
before Alpha Phi Omega, national
service fraternity.
In his talk, Dean Jackson pointed
out the steady increase in the per
centage of total University revenue
paid by the students. Citing figures
of 20 and 10 years ago, as compared
with last year, he showed the per
centage has increased from 22.63
per cent in 1919-20 to 48.05 per cent
last year.
INCOMES GROW
In 1919-20, total income per stu
dent from student fees, endowment
income, gifts, and miscellaneous in
come was $579.99. In that year, each
student paid $131.25 to the Univer
sity. Last year, total income per
student, equalled $761.37, while each
student paid, on the average, $365.85,
Whether or not student fees will
continue to rise was not stated.
"That is entirely in the hands of
the president and the board," Dean
Jackson commented. "We can say
nothing at the present time."
Dean Jackson emphasized the in
creasing difficulty of balancing the
University budget during the past
ten years, and blamed major reduc
tions in interest rates for the lower
ing of income. He said drastic econ
omies in physical plant, such as
roads and buildings, had been made
necessary because of the reduced
income.
ADDITIONS NEEDED
"We have tried to keep expenses
down;" he said, "but the steady
growth of the University has pre
vented this. We have had to add to
physical plant, departments, and the
academic curriculum, even though
the income has been reduced."
He pointed out the University
spends aobut $3,000,000 yearly; which
is divided between comptroller's ex
penses on the physical plant of about
$500,000, and the academic budget of
$2,500,000.

In 1919-20, total income per stu
dent from student fees, endowment
income, gifts, and miscellaneous in
come was $579.99. In that year, each
student paid $131.25 to the Univer
sity. Last year, total income per
student, equalled $761.37, while each
student paid, on the average, $365.85,
Whether or not student fees will
continue to rise was not stated.
"That is entirely in the hands of
the president and the board," Dean
Jackson commented. "We can say
nothing at the present time."
Dean Jackson emphasized the in
creasing difficulty of balancing the
University budget during the past
ten years, and blamed major reduc
tions in interest rates for the lower
ing of income. He said drastic econ
omies in physical plant, such as
roads and buildings, had been made
necessary because of the reduced
income.
ADDITIONS NEEDED
"We have tried to keep expenses
down;" he said, "but the steady
growth of the University has pre
vented this. We have had to add to
physical plant, departments, and the
academic curriculum, even though
the income has been reduced."
He pointed out the University
spends aobut $3,000,000 yearly; which
is divided between comptroller's ex
penses on the physical plant of about
$500,000, and the academic budget of
$2,500,000.
The business side of the Stanford
picture was explained briefly by
Acting Comptroller J. Hugh Jack
son last night in an informal talk
before Alpha Phi Omega, national
service fraternity.
In his talk, Dean Jackson pointed
out the steady increase in the per
centage of total University revenue
paid by the students. Citing figures
of 20 and 10 years ago, as compared
with last year, he showed the per
centage has increased from 22.63
per cent in 1919-20 to 48.05 per cent
last year.
