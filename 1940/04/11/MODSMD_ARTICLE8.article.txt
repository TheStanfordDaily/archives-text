# S.F. Orchestra Wins Cheers; Stern Praised
## 
### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
Setting no milestones in musical
history but perfectly keyed to the
ears of a Stanford audience was last
night's "pops" concert by the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra in
Memorial Hall.
Playing under the baton of Pierre
Monteux, one of the world's great
conductors and a musician of ex
traordinary energy and genius, the
orchestra presented an enthusias
tically-received program of roman
tic music.
STERN SHOWS PROMISE
Isaac Stern, 19-year-old violinist,
was the soloist in Tschaikowsky's
D Major concerto. He gave a solid,
masterful performance of the work
which is packed with technical acro
batics and singable melodies typical
of the composer.
The young artist lacked some of
the depth of feeling and understand
ing that one expects from a more
mature artist. However, in last
evening's instance this may have
been to his advantage because an
overdose of emotion can turn
Tschaikowsky into something which
can only be described as "schmaltz."
SECOND MOVEMENT
Particularly fine was the melodic,
minor second movement which was
played with convincing sincerity, al
though the breath-taking long move
ment was a true technical feat. In a
few years one can expect things
from Mr. Stern which will be com
pletely satisfying to both the emo
tions and the intellect of his audi
ences.
The genius of Maestro Monteux
was especially noticeable last, night
to those in the audience who have
observed the remarkable transition
of the San Francisco Symphony from
a high-grade group B orchestra to an
organization with an undisputable A
rating during the past few years.
The program opened with a fin
ished, mellow performance of the
dignified, stirring Leonore Overture
No. 3 (the one most often heard in
concert) by Ludwig van Beethoven.
Outstanding in the second half were
two nocturnes, "Clouds" and "Fes
tivals" by the French impressionist,
Claude Debussy, who is one of Mon
teux's specialties.
The thrilling blend of physical
passion and spiritual love that is the
fabric of Wagner's "Tristan and
Isolde" was conveyed by a magnifi
cently moving rendition of the Pre
lude and Love Death. One wonders
why the exquisite love duet from
the second act is not included in the
frequently heard symphonic syn
theses from this opera.
Completing the concert was a
jovial interpretation of the familiar
waltz, "Tales from the Vienna
Woods," by Johann Strauss, and the
overworked tone poem, "Finlandia,"
of Sibelius.

observed the remarkable transition
of the San Francisco Symphony from
a high-grade group B orchestra to an
organization with an undisputable A
rating during the past few years.
The program opened with a fin
ished, mellow performance of the
dignified, stirring Leonore Overture
No. 3 (the one most often heard in
concert) by Ludwig van Beethoven.
Outstanding in the second half were
two nocturnes, "Clouds" and "Fes
tivals" by the French impressionist,
Claude Debussy, who is one of Mon
teux's specialties.
The thrilling blend of physical
passion and spiritual love that is the
fabric of Wagner's "Tristan and
Isolde" was conveyed by a magnifi
cently moving rendition of the Pre
lude and Love Death. One wonders
why the exquisite love duet from
the second act is not included in the
frequently heard symphonic syn
theses from this opera.
Completing the concert was a
jovial interpretation of the familiar
waltz, "Tales from the Vienna
Woods," by Johann Strauss, and the
overworked tone poem, "Finlandia,"
of Sibelius.
Setting no milestones in musical
history but perfectly keyed to the
ears of a Stanford audience was last
night's "pops" concert by the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra in
Memorial Hall.
Playing under the baton of Pierre
Monteux, one of the world's great
conductors and a musician of ex
traordinary energy and genius, the
orchestra presented an enthusias
tically-received program of roman
tic music.
STERN SHOWS PROMISE
Isaac Stern, 19-year-old violinist,
was the soloist in Tschaikowsky's
D Major concerto. He gave a solid,
masterful performance of the work
which is packed with technical acro
batics and singable melodies typical
of the composer.
The young artist lacked some of
the depth of feeling and understand
ing that one expects from a more
mature artist. However, in last
evening's instance this may have
been to his advantage because an
overdose of emotion can turn
Tschaikowsky into something which
can only be described as "schmaltz."
SECOND MOVEMENT
Particularly fine was the melodic,
minor second movement which was
played with convincing sincerity, al
though the breath-taking long move
ment was a true technical feat. In a
few years one can expect things
from Mr. Stern which will be com
pletely satisfying to both the emo
tions and the intellect of his audi
ences.
The genius of Maestro Monteux
was especially noticeable last, night
to those in the audience who have
observed the remarkable transition

a high-grade group B orchestra to an
