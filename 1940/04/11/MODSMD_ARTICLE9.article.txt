# Library Displays Printing Exhibit
## 
### 
Printing, ranging from a sample of
Guttenberg's 42-line Bible to out
standing American works are on
display in the Library honoring the
500 th anniversary of printing.
Although printing was done for a
number of years before 1440, that
date is celebrated because it was
then that Guttenbcrg experimented
with movable types instead of the
former carved pages which could be
used for one job only.
Pre-Guttenberg books, both of
the wood-block and the still earlier
hand manuscript varieties, are in
cluded in the display. A rare ex
ample of the latter is a facsimile of
Petrarch's copy of Virgil.
