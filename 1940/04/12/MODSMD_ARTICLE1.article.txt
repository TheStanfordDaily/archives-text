### WILSON CANNON 
just can't win.
Remember the explanation your
old high school teacher gave you
about a dilemma and its two horns?
That's Norway's situation. Only
trouble is she can't even choose her
own horn. Someone else will blow it
for her.
One of the little Scandinavian
country's predicaments is quite evi
dent. That horn is the political ab
sorption of Norway by the Reich,
which is now in the process of com
pletion.
Unless England and her French
ally can prevent it. .
There's where the second horn
comes into the picture. England,
self-appointed savior of little coun
tries, hits a policy snag. Yesterday
Winston Churchill, First Lord of the
Admiralty, etc., ad infinitum, told
the House that when the Germans
are driven from Norway, England
will take over.
Quite an outlook for Norway.
Either she is defeated by Ger
many, and engulfed; or she is res
cued by England with the same
eventual political result.
Funny thing about these Norwe
gians. Among the staunchest of all
national-conscious peoples, they
would appreciate "rescue" little
more than "defeat." To them the
end would be the same regardless
of the means.
Norway's situation is strongly
reminiscent of the oft-mentioned
innocent bystander.
* * *
Many are apt to forget, however,
that before the goose can be eaten,
the fowl must be basted.
Biggest question now before Ger
many, then, is to baste her goose.
Last night's press reports pre
sented their usual vari-colored pic
ture of the events of the Scandina
vian war. Taking Berlin claims and
London's assertions and balancing
them, the war appeared to be still
in deadlock.
While British naval victories ap
peared to he almost overwhelming,
Germany still maintained its stra
tegic hold on Norway's key ports.
Continual attempts by (he Reich to
bolster her forces on Scandinavian
soil met with varying success.
But Norway will find itself forced
to lay golden eggs even should the
British succeed in their now-deter
mined effort to oust the Nazi in
vaders. The English army of occu
pation would safeguard "Norwegian
interests" as closely and firmly as a
victorious Reich force would.
And the golden eggs of victory
are as important to the British as
similar metallic hen-fruit would be
to the Germans. Only difference
would be in the channels victory
would take.
* * *
SHOULD the Reich succeed in their
k Norwegian campaign, as Propa
ganda Minister Goebbels claims it
will, it will mean that North Sea
lanes will be a continuous thread of
ore-boats bound from Norway to
Germany. Berlin must have Norwe
gian iron to continue her part in
World War 11.
Conversely, if the English oust the
Germans from Norway, as spokes
man Churchill claims they will,
North Sea lanes will be extremely
empty, as far as ore-boats bound
from Norway to Germany are con
cerned. Britain needs to clamp
down on this supply route if the
war is to be an assured Allied vic
tory.
But for little Norway, the situ
ation is not cased by knowledge
of this. She still finds her bounda
ries a sieve for incoming foreign
ers. And she still doesn't like it.
Unfortunately there is little she
can do about it. She certainly could
not stop invading Germany by a plea
of neutrality. And good old helping
England will lend a hand whether
Norway wants it or not.
Anyway, Norway will make a
good battleground.

That's Norway's situation. Only
trouble is she can't even choose her
own horn. Someone else will blow it
for her.
One of the little Scandinavian
country's predicaments is quite evi

which is now in the process of com
pletion.

ally can prevent it. .
There's where the second horn
comes into the picture. England,
self-appointed savior of little coun
tries, hits a policy snag. Yesterday
Winston Churchill, First Lord of the
Admiralty, etc., ad infinitum, told
the House that when the Germans
are driven from Norway, England
will take over.
Quite an outlook for Norway.
Either she is defeated by Ger
many, and engulfed; or she is res
cued by England with the same
eventual political result.
Funny thing about these Norwe
gians. Among the staunchest of all
national-conscious peoples, they
would appreciate "rescue" little
more than "defeat." To them the
end would be the same regardless
of the means.
Norway's situation is strongly
reminiscent of the oft-mentioned
innocent bystander.

Biggest question now before Ger

Last night's press reports pre
sented their usual vari-colored pic
ture of the events of the Scandina

London's assertions and balancing
them, the war appeared to be still
in deadlock.
While British naval victories ap
peared to he almost overwhelming,
Germany still maintained its stra
tegic hold on Norway's key ports.
Continual attempts by (he Reich to
bolster her forces on Scandinavian
soil met with varying success.
But Norway will find itself forced
to lay golden eggs even should the
British succeed in their now-deter
mined effort to oust the Nazi in
vaders. The English army of occu
pation would safeguard "Norwegian
interests" as closely and firmly as a
victorious Reich force would.
And the golden eggs of victory
are as important to the British as
similar metallic hen-fruit would be
to the Germans. Only difference
would be in the channels victory
would take.
