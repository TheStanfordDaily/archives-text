# Nominations Over; Hall, Row Relax
## No Declination Slips Reported; Nominees Introduced to Farm 
### ROWAN HALL 
The race for Hall and Row
nominations safely out of the way,
Form politicos yesterday relaxed
to repair jaded forces before the
onslaught on A.S.S.U. and class
posts next Tuesday.
Biggest political event of the day,
purely a Row show, was the elec
tion of Pete Whittlesey to head In
terfraternity Council next year. Bill
Weeden was named Council secre- j
tary.
Routine business was yesterday's
all-University assembly, at which
candidates were introduced by I
President Ken Cuthbertson. Mark
ing the first time in Stanford his- |
tory that a write-in candidate has
appeared on the stage with officially
named contestants, Kenny Davidson,
proposed for B.A.C. representative;
Ken Koch, graduate man on Ex
Committee naminee; and Mary Jean
Haynes, proposed for secretary of
the junior class, all appeared at yes
terday's conclave.
Their nomination blanks were not
received by Election Chief Bill
Leckie by Wednesday and it was
disclosed they would seek their of
fices as write-in candidates.
John Alltucker, official Hall can
didate, first A.S.S.U. presidency
nominee to be introduced by Cuth
bertson, said he saw no need for
extensive reform in student admin
istration, enumerating, however, the
problems that would face the next
student executive. Among these he
listed decreasing interest rates of
University income and possibly rise
| in tuition, and living-group innova
tions proposed by the Dean of Men.
Powers Cameron, independent
candidate, discussed the University's
social structure, pleading for an end
to the traditional Hall-Row split that
marks student body elections. He
urged that voters "support the man
best, qualified for the position rather
than voting along party lines."
Bruce Jessup, Row nominee, stated
that it was impossible, he thought,
to foresee what the problems of the
executive job would be. He an
nounced that, if he were elected, he
would treat each issue as it arose in
the light of its particular ramifica
tions.
Brief speeches were given by
Betty Moses and Anne Townsend,
Row and Hall nominees, respec
tively for the A.S.S.U. vice-presi
dency.
Bill Leckie had announced no
declinations to The Daily at a late
hour last night.
Declination statements must be
filed with Leckie by 12 o'clock noon
today. Still undetermined last night
was whether or not Delt Bill
Turner would continue on the slate
for senior member on Ex Commit
tee. Ray Diekemper had been se
lected by the Row caucus to oppose
Dwight Hutchinson, Hall nominee
and only other man in the race.
The position of Alumni Council
Representative for the Class of 1940
was without a nominee, according
to Bill Leckie, election chairman,
last night, and will be filled by a
write-in candidate.

Representative for the Class of 1940
was without a nominee, according
to Bill Leckie, election chairman,

The race for Hall and Row
nominations safely out of the way,
Form politicos yesterday relaxed
to repair jaded forces before the
onslaught on A.S.S.U. and class
posts next Tuesday.
Biggest political event of the day,
purely a Row show, was the elec
tion of Pete Whittlesey to head In
terfraternity Council next year. Bill
Weeden was named Council secre- j
tary.
Routine business was yesterday's
all-University assembly, at which
candidates were introduced by I
President Ken Cuthbertson. Mark
ing the first time in Stanford his- |
tory that a write-in candidate has
appeared on the stage with officially
named contestants, Kenny Davidson,
proposed for B.A.C. representative;
Ken Koch, graduate man on Ex
Committee naminee; and Mary Jean
Haynes, proposed for secretary of
the junior class, all appeared at yes
terday's conclave.
Their nomination blanks were not
received by Election Chief Bill
Leckie by Wednesday and it was
disclosed they would seek their of
fices as write-in candidates.
John Alltucker, official Hall can
didate, first A.S.S.U. presidency
nominee to be introduced by Cuth
bertson, said he saw no need for
extensive reform in student admin
istration, enumerating, however, the
problems that would face the next
student executive. Among these he
listed decreasing interest rates of
University income and possibly rise
| in tuition, and living-group innova
tions proposed by the Dean of Men.
Powers Cameron, independent
candidate, discussed the University's
social structure, pleading for an end
to the traditional Hall-Row split that
marks student body elections. He
urged that voters "support the man
best, qualified for the position rather
than voting along party lines."
Bruce Jessup, Row nominee, stated
that it was impossible, he thought,
to foresee what the problems of the
executive job would be. He an
nounced that, if he were elected, he
would treat each issue as it arose in
the light of its particular ramifica
tions.
Brief speeches were given by
Betty Moses and Anne Townsend,
Row and Hall nominees, respec
tively for the A.S.S.U. vice-presi
dency.
Bill Leckie had announced no

hour last night.
Declination statements must be

Turner would continue on the slate
for senior member on Ex Commit
tee. Ray Diekemper had been se
lected by the Row caucus to oppose
Dwight Hutchinson, Hall nominee
and only other man in the race.
