# White Claims U.S. to Gain Cultural Lead
## Professor Foresees New U.S. Leadership 
### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
"The world is in the midst of a
second Hundred Years' War that
began in 1914."
This, according to Lynn T. White,
assistant professor of history, will re
sult in a shift of the cultural center
from Europe to the United States.
And that shift already has begun,
Dr. White says.
"The peace from 1918 to 1939 was
merely an Armistice. There will be
other temporary respites, but they
will not last." And, as he continues,
Dr. White describes the analogy of
the 20th century and the 15th cen
tury.
CULTURE FLED FRANCE
At the end of Europe's first Hun
dred Years' War, France relin
quished her artistic and cultural su
premacy. And it was not until 200
years later—at about the time of
Louis XlV—that she again attained
definite leadersihp.
When France was laid waste by
these periodic battles, the culture
she had known fied to Italy. From
Italy it was transferred for a brief
time to Spain, and to the Nether
lands, Dr. White said.
Drawing an analogy between the
Europe of that day and the Conti
nent today, he said Europe's modern
cultural leadership is being trans
ferred to America. "And this will be
even more noticeable in the next
few years" he indicated.
LEADS IN MEDICINE
Already in the field of medicine,
the United States offers everything
that any European university can
teach the student.
In technique and research the
United States has equalled the Con
tinent for several years. "What
America lacks is a means—or series
of means—to co-ordinate these ac
tivities," Dr. White believes. And,
rapidly, America is developing a
variety of learned journals and
publications that supply savants with
information about the research of
their contemporaries.
At the same time, it is essential
that the universities and colleges of
the western world train scholars and
students to continue the cultural
heritage that Europe is sending to
these shores. Dr. White feels
strongly about this.
