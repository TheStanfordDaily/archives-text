# Gridders to Don Moleskins Today
## 
### 
Next fall's Big Red Machine will
make its first full dress appearance
this afternoon on the practice field.
For the first three workouts the In
dian gridders have been going
through practice in shorts, but to
day they will don moleskins and go
to it in efirnest.
During the rest of April, with the
squad on a three-drills-a-week
schedule, only one workout weekly
will be open to the public and the
press. Every Tuesday the gates
will be open. On Wednesdays and
Fridays they will be locked.
Coach Clark Shaughnessy's pur
pose in holding closed practice is not
to hide state secrets, but to give the
players a chance to concentrate on
learning the new system.
