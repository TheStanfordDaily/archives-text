# Indians Seek World's Record In Mile Relay Against U.C.L.A.
## 
### CHUCK SMITH 
H«w badly they heat U.C.L.A.'s spotty track team will not be the
chief worry of Coach Bill Ellington's cindermen in tomorrow's meet with
the Bruins on Angell Field.
The big question in their minds w ill he whether or not their teammates,
Clyde Jeffrey, Craig Williamson. Charlie Shaw, and Ernie Clark will
break the world record for the mile relay.
For tomorrow at approximately 3:30 this quartet will make a planned
and determined attack 011 the standing mark of 3:11.6. The composite
best times of these four form a standing start breaks the existing mark
by a full second and tomorrow three of the team's members will have run
ning starts. *

For convention's sake a regular
meet with the Bruins, beginning at
1:45 with the javelin and at 2 o'clock
with the mile run, will proceed the
climactic relay. "Conventional" is
the word, for the Indians should
clean up on their rivals from the
South. Conservatively, the Daily
Dope Sheet has picked the Cards to
win by 86 to 45, and the margin of
victory could easily be much greater.
Captain Clyde Jeffrey will be the
only performer on the relay team
to run a race during the earlier
part ol the meet. He will run, and
should easily win, the 100-yard
dash, with little Ken Battaglia, who
rambled 0.7 yesterday, giving the
Bruin speed burner, Hal Sinclair, a
heck of a battle.
SINCLAIR FAVORED
In the 220-yard dash the striding
Sinclair will be favored with a best
thne of 21.4. Even with their four
best men saving themselves for a
worid record try, the Indians with
Les Johnson and Burman Skrable
should take one-two from the
U.C.L.A. ace, Tom Bradley, who is
out ol condition in the 440.
Paul Moore and Blair Hyde should
go one-two in the half; Mush Girard
and the same Moore, one-two in
the mile; and Jack Moore and A1
Soldate another one-two in the
two-mile to pretty well handle the
distances lor Stanford.
THREE CLEAN SWEEPS
Bruins Bill Lacefield in the highs
with a best of 14.6 and Captain Carl
Mcßain with a mark of 23.6 in the
lows will make interesting compe
tition for the Farm's hurdler, Dick
Simpson. Watch for "Simp" in the
highs, but it looks like the Bruin
captain in the lows.
On the field there may be three
clean sweeps, two by the Cards and
one by the Bruins. In the broad J
jump the invaders may take all
three places with Lacefield and Pat j
Turner flirting with 25 feet and
John Schilling way back at 24 feet.
HIGH JUMP TO BE CLOSE
The Cardinal weight men, Stan
Andersen, Bill Trout, A1 Grey, Arn 1
Cornet, will have a field day and !
should take every point. Indian Bob j
Stone and the Card football coach's I
son, Clark Shaughnessy, Jr., will |
have a close contest in the javelin, j
There will be a hot fight for the
points in the high jump with Indian j
Russ Wulff and Bruins Paul Shoaff
and John Schilling all» around 6 ft
4 in. In the pole vault U.C.L.A.
has a boy who they hope will hit
14 feet before the year is up. This
Jim Edinger should take the vault
with Bob Kenyon of the Cards and
Roy Steed of Ucla close together
for second.
