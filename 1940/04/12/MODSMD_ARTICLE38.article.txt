# Frosh Tracksters To Meet Modesto
## 
### 
With several new men just round- i
ing into shape, the freshman track j
squad is improving steadily, still in
possession of slim hopes of beating
Cal in the Little Big Meet, April 26.
The frosh get their final tune-up [
tomorrow when they meet Modesto
J.C. at Angell Field. Jim Mitchell
and Dick Scott looked good in prac
tice yesterday. Scott ran a 352 in
39.6 and Mitchell ran a couple of j
laps with the varsity distance men, !
finishing nicely.
