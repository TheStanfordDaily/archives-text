# Card Sluggers Plan Comeback Against Bears
## 
### 
In an attempt to wipe away the
memory of their two set-backs
earlier this week, when they lost
lo U.C.L.A. and Santa Clara,
Stanford's hard-luck basehaliers
journey to Berkeley tomorrow to
take a crack at the California
Bears at o'clock.
Coach Harry Wolter will send
Quentin "Cootie" Thompson, prob- j
ably the league's best flinger, to the j
| mound us the Indians go after the
] first game of the annual Stanford-
Cal series. A series victory over the j
Bears would about salvage an oth
erwise not-too-good season for the [
Card nine.
California presents a club which,
although it isn't very high in the j
league standings—fourth place to ;
be exact—can and probably will
cause the Indians plenty of trouble, i
Wolter believes, however, that his
boys can give the Bears all the com
petition they want if only Thompson
| gets some support, both at bat and
in the held. Stanford's trouble to
date has been combining pitching
and fielding strength on the same
days.
Clint Evans' outfit up at Cal has
won four games in league competi
tion so far this season, as against
three victories for Stanford, a com
parison which makes the two teams
look pretty even. In the lost col
umn, however, the Bears have more
of an advantage with only six de
feats as against eight for the Indians.
Although he has made no definite
announcement, Evans has indicated
that he will probably start Mike
Colla on the hill against Stanford.
