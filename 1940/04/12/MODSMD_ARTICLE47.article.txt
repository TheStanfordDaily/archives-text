# Dear Ma 2

### 
T JUST got back from the Boathouse, that half
-1 finished structure I was telling you about.
The sun and the girls and the canoes over
there belie the fact that our staid old campus
is seething with activity again, the activity of
young and ambitious politicians at play.
The only trouble is that some of them play
rough, and the whole lot of them are prejudiced
toward their particular favorite candidates.
Even The Daily is taking a lambasting from
some groups because the budding party statis
ticians figure we are offering more reader in
terest for some of the nominees than for others.
Sometimes the Hall and the Row, our two dif
fusions of interests, or parties, have both been
mad at us at the same time. Twice I had to eat
meals at the Chinaman's because other thresh
olds were barred to me, due in the main to some
articles we ran by a fellow named Rowan Hall.
As you know, the Chinaman has never played
politics.
It's very funny how these biases develop.
The Hallmen snub me because we called their
candidate "lanky" and "ranch-bred," the Row
touts were burned because the lanky candi
date's name came first in the story. Some of
my buddies have asked me whyinhell I don't
move into the Halls and make my coup com
plete.
Oh yes, and the Hallmen are mad because
we called the Row candidate, who is blond
and good-looking, blond and good-looking.
Incidentally, mom, the lanky Hall candidate
is called "Cowboy" by some of his mates and
he played basketball, where his height was
very valuable. But The Daily is still being
heckled no end. It's the truth that hurts, yeah,
it hurts the guy who tells it down here.
Then there's another fellow who announced
that he was going to buck the Hall and run
independently. Naturally this guy was the
news of the moment and got the top play. Boy,
the other two factions were well-nigh violent.
It's probably a good thing for us that most of
the campus is nominally conservative. A couple
of accurate bomb-throwers wouldn't let us off
so easily.
It seems to me that all three are missing the
angles when it comes to campaigning. If I
were the lanky one, I'd wear a pair of the oldest
cow boots I could find and give the electorate
a chance to point at me and say, "That's Lanky
Louie, who's promised us honesty, open-mind
edness, and fair play." Teddy Roosevelt, Jack
Garner, and a lot of others rode into office on
down-to-earth policies. And many of them rode
in on a horse.
Back-to-the-Farm showed us that Stanford
people can and will be as common and as low
brow as the students at any state college.
And the politicians are sore instead of thank
ful!

ticians figure we are offering more reader in
terest for some of the nominees than for others.
Sometimes the Hall and the Row, our two dif
fusions of interests, or parties, have both been
mad at us at the same time. Twice I had to eat
meals at the Chinaman's because other thresh
olds were barred to me, due in the main to some
articles we ran by a fellow named Rowan Hall.
As you know, the Chinaman has never played
politics.
It's very funny how these biases develop.
The Hallmen snub me because we called their
candidate "lanky" and "ranch-bred," the Row
touts were burned because the lanky candi
date's name came first in the story. Some of
my buddies have asked me whyinhell I don't
move into the Halls and make my coup com
plete.
Oh yes, and the Hallmen are mad because
we called the Row candidate, who is blond
and good-looking, blond and good-looking.
Incidentally, mom, the lanky Hall candidate
is called "Cowboy" by some of his mates and
he played basketball, where his height was
very valuable. But The Daily is still being
heckled no end. It's the truth that hurts, yeah,
it hurts the guy who tells it down here.
Then there's another fellow who announced
that he was going to buck the Hall and run
independently. Naturally this guy was the
news of the moment and got the top play. Boy,
the other two factions were well-nigh violent.
It's probably a good thing for us that most of
the campus is nominally conservative. A couple
of accurate bomb-throwers wouldn't let us off
so easily.
It seems to me that all three are missing the
angles when it comes to campaigning. If I
were the lanky one, I'd wear a pair of the oldest
cow boots I could find and give the electorate
a chance to point at me and say, "That's Lanky
Louie, who's promised us honesty, open-mind
edness, and fair play." Teddy Roosevelt, Jack
Garner, and a lot of others rode into office on
down-to-earth policies. And many of them rode
in on a horse.
Back-to-the-Farm showed us that Stanford
people can and will be as common and as low
brow as the students at any state college.
And the politicians are sore instead of thank
ful!

T JUST got back from the Boathouse, that half
-1 finished structure I was telling you about.
The sun and the girls and the canoes over
there belie the fact that our staid old campus
is seething with activity again, the activity of
young and ambitious politicians at play.
The only trouble is that some of them play
rough, and the whole lot of them are prejudiced
toward their particular favorite candidates.
Even The Daily is taking a lambasting from
some groups because the budding party statis
ticians figure we are offering more reader in
terest for some of the nominees than for others.
