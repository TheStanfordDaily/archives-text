STANFORD'S track team is very much in
evidence on Angell Field these days. Even
though the B.A.C. didn't erect those bleachers
to accommodate the throngs that will sweep
onto the Farm at Big Meet time, the track squad
is bearing up well. They haven't any fancy
traveling jackets—and they won't be making
any long, luxurious trips. They even awoke
one morning to find next year's coach picked
right under their nose—before this season
started.
Harassed by such major and minor difficul
ties, Bill Ellington's outfit drew a crowd of 3,000
last week to watch them trounce the Olympic
Club. This week's meet is a more important
affair.
The eyes of the sporting world are centered
on the Farm's oval, where the nation's fastest
four-man relay team will battle a stop watch for
a new record. When Charlie Shaw, Ernie Clark,
Craig Williamson, and Clyde Jeffrey gang up
on the present mark of 3:11.6—if they are
pressed at all by the U.C.L.A. men—the world
may see a new record.
And if they don't chalk up one tomorrow, no
one will be disappointed. There are plenty of
meets to come.—D. H.
