## GARBER GARBLE 
### 
r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
I thought only extreme cases of high school love
sickness were attracted to the type of "music" ground
out by him who so modestly refers to himself as "The
Idol of the Airlanes." I realize that the tastes in music
of Stanford as a whole are more conservative than
mine, but I'll bet that less than a quarter of those who
danced to Garber in the City will side with the "Idol."
Every man in Ellington's band is a real musician,
and he doesn't bury his nose in the notes as is the
custom with the members of most bands. The slight
est remarks about the colored race in the article men
tioned above doesn't merit discussion. Come on, folks,
go to the dance with an unbiased mind and give the
Duke a listen.
Of the small minority of stuffed shirts on this cam
pus would let down their hair once in a while, they
might discover that there's more to dancing than me
andering monotonously and trying to bend their girls'
arms double.
Sincerely your,
Palmer McCurdy
