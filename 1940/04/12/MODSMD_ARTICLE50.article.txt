### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
SENATOR LA FOLLETTE, JR.
IV/ASHINGTON, D.C. —Senator Robert LaFollette's
office in Washington, like most Senators' offices,
is efficient and new-looking, with secretaries on sev
eral phones and a date-book which is being filled as
fast as it is being depleted. But over the Senator's
desk is a gray-haired reminder that the LaFollette
name is not new in Washington. It is the first Senator
LaFollette, "Fighting Bob," who as Governor and Sen
ator from Wisconsin disproved the old politician's
maxim: Every man has his price.
In the picture, square-jawed Senator LaFollette
Senior is smiling. The small, fiery eyes are not in
dignant as they were in 1917, when LaFollette and
Norris defied a war-hysterical Senate—when LaFol
lette roared in defense of his refusal to vote for dec
laration of war, "The man who calls me unpatriotic
lies in his throat!"
And just as the crusading dynamo smiles in the
picture, so the same square jaw, the same small eyes,
and the same straight forehead are cheerful and cor
dial behind the young Senator's desk. Robert LaFol
lette Junior is a living x-eplica of his father, with the
same incorruptible courage, with the same energetic
voice. But to visitors, the Senator is friendly and
pleasant—more interested in the visitors than he is in
the Reciprocal Trade debates.
* * # *
ILTIS secretaries and the phone interrupt him period
ically, to ask about train reservations and after
noon appointments. But there is no pompous rush in
his conversation, no rhetorical condescension in his
voice. *
He asks about Stanford's debate schedule; about
his fathers' friend and "one of America's great men," *
Ben Lindsey, who fought corruption in the spirit and
era of "Fighting Bob." He remarks calmly upon the
fact that his Progressives seem to have lost some
ground in the Wisconsin primaries. No, he doesn't
know any more about the President's intentions ofr a
third term than does anyone else, and he doesn't be
lieve Washington correspondents do either—despite
some claims to the contrary.
There is none of this Mr.-Smith-Goes-to-Washing
ton naivete or awkwardness about the heir to one of
America's most unimpeachable names. The LaFol
lette courage and the LaFollette honesty are in the
hands of a young man whom no one would find eccen
tric, whom Stanford men would describe as a "good
guy."
Only the picture on the wall and two generations
of LaFollette reputation remind one that Wisconsin's
Senator is a political freak—an honest Progressive in
Washington.
