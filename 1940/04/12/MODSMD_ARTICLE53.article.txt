# Kipling Movie Shows Book's Plot Confusion

"THE LIGHT THAT FAILED," now
playing at the Stanford Theater
For those to whom a Kipling pic
ture means a continuous pageant of
British Tommies fighting for Queen
and Country, Indian scenery, and
troops on parade, "The Light That
Failed" will be a disappointment.
But if you like some of the drama
of human emotions combined with
local color, you will agree that it is
an excellent production.
"The Light That Failed" was Kip
ling's most ambitious novel, and the
one that brought forth the most con
troversial criticisms. This was
mainly because in this work Kipling
attempted a straight novel of con
flict, and abandoned his usual re
liance on atmosphere to embellish
somewhat ordinary plots.
SEEKS FAME AS ARTIST
The story concerns a war corre
spondent (played by Ronald Col
man) returned from the Sudan to
seek fame as an artist in London.
Temporarily distracted from striv
ing for lasting artistic achievement
by his pursuit of temporary popu
larity, he finally succeeds in paint
ing his masterpiece as blindness
overtakes him, only to have it de
stroyed by the spiteful Cockney
wench (Ida Lupino) who serves as
his model.
Colman is then faced with a future
in which all that he holds worth
while is denied him because of his
blindness. The remainder of the
picture is devoted to Colman's solu
tion of a fitting end for his life, and
as a true Kipling character, he does
it in a way fit for a hero.
PLOT OVER-ELABORATE
The movie version suffers from the
same defects that hamper the novel
—over-elaboration of plot, and the
confusion of too many cross-cur
rents of conflicts.
Photography is superb, and the
acting of Ronald Colman polished
and convincing. Ida Lupino, grad
uated from fluffy blonde roles, proves
that she can handle real dramatic
roles. Walter Houston and Dudley
Digges turn in their usual good per
formances in character parts.—Doug
