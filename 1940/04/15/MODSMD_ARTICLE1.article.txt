### WILSON CANNON 
r Netherlands are beginning to
join the parade of "frightened"
neutral nations.
Thus far almost unmentioned in
the American press, and apparently
untouched by the war scares, this
little kingdom evidenced a severe at
tack of the jitters over the week
end.
Queen Wilhelmina yesterday is
sued a royal decree extending the
nation's martial law areas to cover
almost the entire kingdom. Her
move greatly strengthened the hand
played by elderly Premier de Geer
and his Army High Command.
Emotional temperatures in this
neutral country rose sharply dur
ing the past week due to Nazi
successes in Scandinavia. The
easy absorption of Denmark, and
Hie pat hand held by the Reich m
Norway were taken as indirect
threats to the sovereignty of the
Netherlands.
And they have good reason to
worry.
Since the first day of World War
11, the Netherlands have taken a
stand not uncommon to neutrals of
that size and military strength.
"We want no part of this fight,"
was their song. "Go ahead and
scrap, but leave us out. We want to
be neutral."
In the early days of the war, this
type of ballad was quite acceptable.
Even to the warring nations, ap
parently. International law; right of
nations; rule of "cricket"; and all
that seemed to assure the safety of
the minor powers of Europe.
* « *
B U , T the warring powers seem to
have changed their tune. Top
song on World War II hit parade has
become "I will go as far as I like
with you."
Especially conscious of this is the
Kingdom of the Netherlands. And
most especially during the past
week as the saga of neutral nations
was borne home by Norwegian-Dan
ish casualties. Besides, the Nether
lands has not forgotten the painful
lesson learned by Belgium during
World War I.
Exactly whom the Netherlands
fear cannot he certain. Both the
Allies and the Reich have been
extremely active in their propa
ganda. Watch out for the "other
side" is commonly heard in Queen
Wilhclmina-land.
However, that they are preparing
for any eventuality became certain
over the week-end. Martial law
zones, covering key points; military
guards at all public properties (ra
dio stations, ministries, airfields);
oiling the wheels of the military ma
chine are only a few of the defense
measures authorized recently.
# * *
SPECIAL attempt to keep these
u measures and others from the
general eye high-lighted the Neth
erlands move. But press reports not
ed that even to the casual observa
tion of the foreign population there
was a noticeable feeling of tension.
The Dutch know that their sea
coast would present extremely fa
vorable bases for either English or
German ships and planes. Germany
could add Netherlands airfields to
the Danish ones which now give
them shorter flying distance to the
British Isles.
English military experts see the
Netherlands an important ally for
two main reasons: (1) Base for
bombing expeditions deep into the
Reich. (2) Base for submarines
which from this vantage point
could flank German supply fleets.
But the Dutch see a more im- j
portant use for the Netherlands, j
They would rather use it as a place 1
to live—free from foreign domina- j
tion. They do not want to fight; they
do not want anything from World i
War II except neutrality.

SPECIAL attempt to keep these

The Dutch know that their sea
coast would present extremely fa
vorable bases for either English or
German ships and planes. Germany
could add Netherlands airfields to
the Danish ones which now give
them shorter flying distance to the
British Isles.
English military experts see the
Netherlands an important ally for
two main reasons: (1) Base for
bombing expeditions deep into the
Reich. (2) Base for submarines
which from this vantage point
could flank German supply fleets.

portant use for the Netherlands, j
They would rather use it as a place 1
to live—free from foreign domina- j
tion. They do not want to fight; they
do not want anything from World i
War II except neutrality.
"Nice work if they can get it ..." I
r Netherlands are beginning to
join the parade of "frightened"
neutral nations.
Thus far almost unmentioned in
the American press, and apparently
untouched by the war scares, this
little kingdom evidenced a severe at
tack of the jitters over the week
end.
Queen Wilhelmina yesterday is
sued a royal decree extending the
nation's martial law areas to cover
almost the entire kingdom. Her
move greatly strengthened the hand
played by elderly Premier de Geer
and his Army High Command.
Emotional temperatures in this
neutral country rose sharply dur
ing the past week due to Nazi
successes in Scandinavia. The
easy absorption of Denmark, and
Hie pat hand held by the Reich m
Norway were taken as indirect
threats to the sovereignty of the
Netherlands.
And they have good reason to
worry.
Since the first day of World War
11, the Netherlands have taken a
stand not uncommon to neutrals of
that size and military strength.
"We want no part of this fight,"
