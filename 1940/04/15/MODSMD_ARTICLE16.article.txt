## 
### 
Stanford will streamline Shakespeare in (lie staging of "Richard II"
when the play is presented by the Speech and Drama Division in Memorial
Hall, May 2, 3, and 4.
The stage streamlining has been effected by Waldemar Johansen, tech
nical director, with his super-colossal 28-foot sets, designed for the
Shakespeare tragedy. Excepting^

the two intermissions, the play will
flow along with no scene shift,
breaks.
Mr. Johansen has designed 10 sets
for the 15 scenes of the play, and
speed of scene shifting will be
achieved by a system of set se
quences which will alternate large
and small sets. Scenes within scenes
in the manner of the London Globe
Theater, original playhou.se for
Shakespearean dramas, will aid in
the streamlining attempt.
A music score will be composed
to carry out the period effect and
to supplement the carrying action
with fanfares and flourishes. This
action will take place before a drop
curtain while rapid and quiet, shift
ing of sets, built on castored wag
ons, will go on behind.
Emphasizing the period of the
play will be the stylized Gothic de
sign of the sets. Most of the scenes
will be viewed through a Gothic
arch, and even the trees in the out
dor scenes have been styled to
carry out the Gothic motif. A con
vincing interior of Westminster Ab
bey has been achieved by reproduc
ing the filigree of Westminster ar
chitecture.
Color theme of the play will be
violet, brown and green, which is
to form an effective contrast and
complement to the costumes of the
