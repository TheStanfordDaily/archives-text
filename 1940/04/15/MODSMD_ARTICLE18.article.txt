## 
### 
Tribute to Henry Newell, Utah
mining engineer who left $200,000
to establish 30 scholarships for Utah
students at Stanford, was paid by
President Wilbur a Salt Lake City
dinner last week.
Dr. Wilbur especially lauded the
wisdom and foresightedness of Mr.
Newell, who was a contemporary of
Senator Stanford in the 'eighties,
saying, "No one can even begin to
kow what values can come from such
an investment."
