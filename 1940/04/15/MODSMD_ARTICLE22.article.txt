Greyson Bryan, candidate or the
Upper Row caucus for the A. S.
S. U. presidency, announced to
The Daily last night that he
would definitely run in tomor
row s final elections as a write-in
candidate.
His voluntary nomination now
makes a balanced four-man, Hall-
Row election possible. Previously
the names of John Alltucker and
Powers Cameron, Hallmen, and
Bruce Jessup, Beta Thcta Pi, had
been officially made.
Bryan, manager of the Concert
Bureau and chairman of the Junior
Prom committee, intimated that a
careful study of the preferential bal
loting system had convinced him that,
his candidacy would in no wise harm
the chances of the other Row
nominee.
LARGE WRITE-IN SLATE
"A complete study of the prefer
ential ballot shows unquestionably,"
he told The Daily, "that there is no
such thing as a party split under this
ballot. I feel that my candidacy
gives me a shot at something I cer
tainly would like to have without
hampering the chances of any of
the other candidates if they prove
to be a choice of the majority."
The four-man race now makes it
almost definite that, no one of the
quartet will be nominated on the
first, or possibly even the second
ballot. Under the preferential sys
tem the low man of the nominees is
dropped after each count and his
second votes tallied until one of the
candidates has a majority.
Bryan's decision gives Stanford
one of its largest preannounced
slates of write-in hopefuls on rec
ord. These include, Ken Koch, D.U.,
graduate man on Ex Committee; Ken
Davidson, D.K.E., B.A.C. member;
Mary Jean Haynes, Union, secre
tary-treasurer, junior class; and
Larry Livingston, alumni council
representative.
NO DECLINATIONS
Bill Leckie, election board chair
man, has also announced that he
received no declinations from candi
dates prior to the deadline last Fri
day noon. This means that Bill
Turner, Delt and senior Ex Commit
tee nomnee, had decided to buck
the Row caucus and seek the posi
tion he held as a sophomore.
Most of the campus politicians,
excluding a few of the caucus
bosses, felt the the additional can
didacies will do no harm to their
slates. They base their confidence
on the weeding-out process of the
preferential plan in which the least
popular of their standard bearers
will lose out in an early round.
Their wind-up campaigns today
and tonight, however, will unques
tionably accentuate the fact that,
their constituents should vole for
party men in both the first and
second choice squares, so as to in
sure the eventual election of the
most popular of the two.
