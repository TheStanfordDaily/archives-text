## Baltic Mines to Mottle Up Nazi Navy At Kiel, Off Norway, Sweden: George VI Promise's Norwegians Aid 
### 
By REAR ADMIRAL YATES STIRLING, U.S. Navy. Retired
NEW \ ORK. April I I (TP).— I lu* British Admiralty claims it has mined
(he Baltic.
The locations given appear to be aimed at bottling up the German fleet
:il Kiel and also halting shipments of ore ami dairy products from Sweden.
The mine fields should act to shut off the German and Danish co;>sts to

all shipping and result in a virtual,
stoppage of water-borne commerce
to German Baltic ports from the
world sea lanes.
MINES A THREAT
Probably the fields are not mined
<!• psely and may be swept up by
German warships unless guarded by
the British. However, Britain by
announcing existence of these fields
to the world can continue legally the
mining of these areas, constantly
threatening all ships carrying mate
rials toward Germany.
Success of this dangerous plan,
should it be undertaken, would

result in isolating Norway and
Sweden Irom Germany, except by
air, and would be a great help to the
Allies in driving out the German
troops from Norway and giving them
the use ot Norwegian air fields.
Finally, it also would tend to pre
vent ultimate seizure of Sweden by
the Germans.
BITTER STRUGGLE WAGING
The losses in ships and men on
both sides to date in Germany's
sudden invasion of Norway tell us
oi the bitterness of that struggle.
Four important German warships,
including a battle cruiser and a
heavy cruiser among a host of less
valuable ships, have been sunk.
Britain acknowledges the loss of four
destroyers. Germany risked her
best warships against the over
whelming superiority of the Allied
fleet. What crucial objective caused
Hitler to jeopardize his already
weakened Navy?
All the key cities on the Atlantic
Coast of Norway, together with the
capital, Oslo, on the Skagerrak were
seized and are in Germany's posses
sion. The British Navy attacked vig
orously enemy ships; but. being un
accompanied by troops, that age old
maxim of the futility of warships at
tacking land forces was again ex
emplified.
ALL HELP' ASSURED
Despite German warship losses this
invasion of Norway is a serious blow
to British naval power.
King George VI has assured Nor
way of 'all help,' which can only
mean that in Allied army will soon
be landed to aid the hard-pressed
Norwegian troops. Will it be of suf
ficient size to defeat the German
troops?
