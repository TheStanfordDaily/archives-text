# Scholarship Aid Study Released
## Booklet Traces 742 Ex-Farm Students 
### 
A booklet tracing the growth of
scholarship aids at Stanford over a
period of 40 years was released re
cently by the Stanford Associates
and the Stanford Fund. It contains
a factual study of 742 alumni of
Stanford who held scholarships when
they were in college.
Of the above total, 134 are now
professors or instructors in univer
sities and college above the junior
college level. Fifty-two are asso
ciated with educational institutions
below the junior college level. The
remainder of the whole group is
spread out in the fields of medicine,
law, business, science, and others.
Only two rften and six women are
unemployed. Among the two dozen
who are in miscellaneous occupa
tions, one is a traffic officer and one
a special agent of the FBI; one plays
professional baseball and one is a
civilian attache of the Japanese Im
perial Navy; one is a United States
Marine and one a Naval Aviation
cadet.
Reviewing the scholarship situa
tion as a whole, the booklet states
that "available aids to students are
grossly unequal to the needs of
young persons who are worthy of
higher education but unable to pay
I its whole cost."
