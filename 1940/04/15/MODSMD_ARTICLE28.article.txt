# Vitousek Smashes Mark at Ucla Meet
## 
### 
Roy Vitousek established a new
Coast Conference record for the
200-yard breaststroke Saturday as
Stanford's swimming team nosed out
U.C.L.A. 38 to 37 at Westwood.
The Farm's big blond paddler was
clocked in 2:29.9.
Stanford got an even break out of
its invasion of the southland, being
crushed by S.C. Friday.
