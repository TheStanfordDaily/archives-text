"With the war situation the way
1 it is now, I do not know when I
will get back."
With this plaintive remark, Miss
Elsa Pehrson, Swedish newspaper
woman, visitor in the United States,
and guest of the University last Fri
dty, summed up her present status.
The blonde and youngish Scandi
navian has spent the past eight
months in Mexico and Southern
California, acting as correspondent
for both her own magazine and the
Stockholm daily paper. Last week
she came to San Francisco to inter
; view Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt.
I While she was there, the news of
Adolf's latest "coup" started ticking
into this country.
"Relations between my country
and Norway are very friendly. My
J countrymen are probably anxious to
help the Norwegians, but the min
ute we let down our northern de
fenses we can expect the Russians."
As she sat at luncheon in the La
l gunita dining room, during the peak
of the day's heat Miss Pehrson ob
served the girls in bright colored
cottons and remarked:
"Why do the)' not wear slix? Down
J in Hollywood all the women wear
' slix."
"Slix" were of course slacks and
Miss Pehrson had to be filled in on
the Lagunita rules concerning this
j garb.
Later in the day, Miss Pehrson and
her companion, Miss Mildred Wors
: wick, secretary to (he Public Exer
! cises Committee, visited the Delta
Gamma house and Miss Pehrson
called on Dean of Men John Bunn.
