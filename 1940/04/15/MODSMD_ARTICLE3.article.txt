front from Skanres Hills to Mine
sund and were preparing to blow
up a bridge over the River Varma.
Ski troops were operating around

an advantage over the German
mechanized forces.

tleship Admiral Scheer and British
leaders sent a message of hope to
the Norwegian people saying "Brit
ish soldiers are coming" to chase the
German army from Norwegian soil.
The Allied mine-field blockade of
Germany, it was said in an official
announcement, has been extended
completely across the Baltic to the
coasts of Lithuania and German
East Prussia in a daring effort to

BALKANS RUMBLE
Balkan diplomats reported tonight
that Premier Benito Mussolini has
concentrated the Italian fleet in the
Dodecanese Islands at the entrance
to the Dardanelles, presumably if is
part of axis strategy agreed upon by
Mussolini and Adolf Hitler.
The Italian fleet, in the entrance to
the Aegean and close to the Turkish
coast would tend to restrain the Al
lies and Turkey from moving against
Germany in the Balkans while Hitler
is trying to secure his domination
of Scandinavia.
The Balkan diplomats here are
convinced that Germany, in the near
future, will inform the Danubian
countries that she had decided to
police the Danube and send a
strong force of gunboats to patrol
the river and protect German ship
ments of Rumanian and Russian oil.

ish soldiers are coming" to chase the
German army from Norwegian soil.
The Allied mine-field blockade of
Germany, it was said in an official
announcement, has been extended

BALKANS RUMBLE
Balkan diplomats reported tonight
that Premier Benito Mussolini has
concentrated the Italian fleet in the
Dodecanese Islands at the entrance
to the Dardanelles, presumably if is
part of axis strategy agreed upon by
Mussolini and Adolf Hitler.
The Italian fleet, in the entrance to
the Aegean and close to the Turkish
coast would tend to restrain the Al
lies and Turkey from moving against
Germany in the Balkans while Hitler
is trying to secure his domination
of Scandinavia.
The Balkan diplomats here are
convinced that Germany, in the near
future, will inform the Danubian
countries that she had decided to
police the Danube and send a
strong force of gunboats to patrol
the river and protect German ship
ments of Rumanian and Russian oil.
