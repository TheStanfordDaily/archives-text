# Papoose Nine Loses Cal Tilt
## Hectic 15-12 Game Spotted by Errors 
### 
A valiant attempt to overcome a
ten-run deficit after four innings
failed Saturday, as the Stanford
frosh baseball team dropped a hec
tic affair to California freshmen, 15-
12. The tilt was the first of the an
nual three-game series. This Satur
day Coach Art Esslinger's boys again
will go to Berkeley lo try to even
the series.
Saturday's clash was a baseball
nightmare. Pitcher Phil Wolf's wild
ness and poor fielding, combined
with erratic support, let Cal shove
across nine tallies in the first two
frames on only three hits.
Left Fielder Kellenberger's home
run with two on in the third was
the first blow for the Papooses, but
starting the fifth the frosh were be
hind 13-3.
Timely hitting by Clark Graham,
Bill Cunha, Ray Hammett, and Kel
lenberger, plus a fine example of
not giving up even when everything
goes wrong enabled the yearlings to
press the issue right up to the last
out.
The Cal nine garnered their 15
j scores on only eight hits, having re
! ceived nine passes, 11 errors, and a
hit by pitched ball. The Cub pitch
ers were even more gratuitous, giv
ing 12 walks, but their teammates
made only three mistakes. The loss
broke an eight-game win strenk.
Tomorrow at 3:30 o'clock, the frosh
j will play their last practice game,
! meeting Menlo J. C. here. Bill Harms
