# Cards Smash World Relay Mark
## Record Time Set at 3:10.5 By Farm Team 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Four pairs of Hying legs brought
a world record to Stanford and a
world of satisfaction to one of
Stanford's grand old. men
The eight legs belonged to Charlie
Shaw, Ernie Clark, Craig William
son, and Clyde Jeffrey. The world
record was their time of 3:10.5 for
the l'our-man mile relay, breaking
by more than a second the old mark
held by a U.S.C. team of 3:11.6.
And the gentleman, a gentleman
who was the happiest person in the
world last Saturday, was Stanford's
track coach, Will B. Ellington.
POLE FOR CARDS
The Bruin team, which look the
outside lane for the relay, was given
a 15 '/li-foot lead to compensate for
the curve. Charlie Shaw erased this
lead and built up a 20-yard one of
his own as he poured it on for a
47.5 first lap. Ernie Clark took over
for the second lap and rambled his
distance in 48.3 to open the margin
up to about 50 yards. A poor pass
from Clark to Craig Williamson cost
the Cards about half a second but
little Craig poured it on to run 47.4.
Captain Clyde Jeffrey stretched a
75-yard lead into around 120 yards
as he rolled his 440 in 47.3.
But this wasn't the only record
broken as the Indians trampled the
Bruins 90'/j to 40'.;. In the first
event on the program Paul Moore
and Mushy Girard staged another of
their thrilling mile races. Paul lay
back until the final stretch, allowing
Mush to set the pace, and then
came like a house afire to take his
teammate by two yards in the new
University record of 4:12.6.
MOORE DOUBLE WINNER
Before running his anchor lap on
the relay team, Jeffrey warmed up
with a 9.6 hundred yard dash. Away
rather slowly. Jeff was a yard back
of U.C.L.A.'s speedy Hal Sinclair at
the 40-yard mark. But there the
Stanford capta n really went to work
and overhauled the negro ace to win
by a yard and a half.
Moore established himself a
double winner when he came back
to take the half-mile in 1:55 away
from Blair Hyde. Stan Andersen,
Card weightman, was another double
winner for the Indians, taking both
the shot and the discus.
Stanford's pole vaulter. Bob Ken
yon, reached a new ceiling when he
hoisted himself over 13 feet 6 inches
to win the event from the favored
Southerner, Edinger. Dick Simpson
and Frank Guthrie ran one-two in
the high hurdles but were forced to
take a second and a third to U.C.-
L.A.'s Captain Carl Mcßain.
Other Stanford winners for the day
were little Jack Moore in the two
mile and Bob Stone in the javelin.
