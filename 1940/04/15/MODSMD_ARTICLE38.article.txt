# Varsity Baseball Team Drops Tough 4-0 Game to Cal Bears
## 
### 
Getting to slender Mike Koll for only five hits while their opponents
were pounding "Coot" Thompson for twice that number of hinglcs, the
Stanford haschallcrs dropped the first contest of the annual Big Game
series to California's Golden Bears by a 4-0 count at Berkeley Saturday.
The Bears jumped into a quick lead when they bunched three hits in

the second inning to bring two runs,
across the plate, and they added one
more tally in both the sixth and
seventh frames for good measure.
Third-baseman Stan Griffith was
California's big gun, offensively bat
ting in three runs with a triple and
a single.
BATTING WEAK
Stanford's failure to bunch their
five bingles spelled "shut-out" in
the run column for the Indians.
Only in the fourth inning when El
ton Boone and Norm Juney each
collected a single did the Cards put
together two hits in the same canto.
Boone, Card third-sacker, also col
lected another single from Koll to
keep intact his four-game-old rec
ord of two hits per game, and was
the only Indian to get more than one
hit. Bob Templeton and Hal Cos
tello got the other Stanford, hits.
The defeat, Stanford's ninth of the
current league season, dropped the
Indians deeper into the cellar in the
conference standings. It was Thomp
son's fourth loss of the season as
agaiqst three wins, a record which
certainly doesn't do justice to the
big right-hander from Oakland,
who has been, and is being given
the once-over by more than one big
league ivory hunter.
ONE CARD ERROR
On the field the Cards played good
ball. Thompson making the only er
ror of the game, but Cal was just as
good defensively and had their bat
ting eyes as well, a combination
which was too much for the Wolter
men to beat.
The second game of the series will
be played next Saturday. The Cards
take on the University of Southern
California here one week from to
day in the deciding game of the
Trojan-Indian series.
In another league game Saturday
U.S.C. topped the high-riding St.
Mary's Gaels 7-4 to retain a mathe
matical chance for the champion
ship which these same two teams
shared last year.

Mary's Gaels 7-4 to retain a mathe
matical chance for the champion
ship which these same two teams
shared last year.
Getting to slender Mike Koll for only five hits while their opponents
were pounding "Coot" Thompson for twice that number of hinglcs, the
Stanford haschallcrs dropped the first contest of the annual Big Game
series to California's Golden Bears by a 4-0 count at Berkeley Saturday.
The Bears jumped into a quick lead when they bunched three hits in

the second inning to bring two runs,
across the plate, and they added one
more tally in both the sixth and
seventh frames for good measure.
Third-baseman Stan Griffith was
California's big gun, offensively bat
ting in three runs with a triple and
a single.
BATTING WEAK
Stanford's failure to bunch their
five bingles spelled "shut-out" in
the run column for the Indians.
Only in the fourth inning when El
ton Boone and Norm Juney each
collected a single did the Cards put
together two hits in the same canto.
Boone, Card third-sacker, also col
lected another single from Koll to
keep intact his four-game-old rec
ord of two hits per game, and was
the only Indian to get more than one
hit. Bob Templeton and Hal Cos
tello got the other Stanford, hits.
The defeat, Stanford's ninth of the
current league season, dropped the
Indians deeper into the cellar in the
conference standings. It was Thomp
son's fourth loss of the season as
agaiqst three wins, a record which
certainly doesn't do justice to the
big right-hander from Oakland,
who has been, and is being given
the once-over by more than one big
league ivory hunter.
ONE CARD ERROR
On the field the Cards played good
ball. Thompson making the only er
ror of the game, but Cal was just as
good defensively and had their bat
ting eyes as well, a combination
which was too much for the Wolter
men to beat.
The second game of the series will
be played next Saturday. The Cards
take on the University of Southern
California here one week from to
day in the deciding game of the
Trojan-Indian series.
