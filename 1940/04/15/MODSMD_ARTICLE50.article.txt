# The 						Preferential Ballot
## 
### 
IT is virtually impossible to split a party under
the preferential ballot election system.
This, of course, is news to the scores of po
litical bosses in present-day and historical Stan
ford who have always felt that the only way to
protect their faction was through the use of the
chug-chug power of a caucus, a pre-caucus for
the more select, and a pre-pre-caucus for the
elite. What goes on before then has escaped
detection.
If Stanford wants proof of the preferential
ballot's strength, she has only to watch the
progress of tomorrow's election. It is unfor
tunate that one of the four outstanding men
for the A.S.S.U. presidency post failed to get
his name on the ballot but those in back of the
latest of the quartet are confident that their man
will prove the worth of the Stanford voting sys
tem and the relative ineffectualness of the
caucus when it comes to selecting the outstand
ing candidates. Naturally they are hoping that
a majority of the electorate will take time
enough to write in their man's name.
For the benefit of a good many people on
the campus who still are dubious as to the
preferential ballot's usefulness, The Daily is
giving the following election results in an
effort to show the utter farcicality behind plots
to run only one man per party where two or
more deserve the honor and the chance at
glory. Stanford is fortunate this year in that one
additional Hall (or Independent) man as well
as one extra Row choice is running. All are
capable; no one will hurt the chances of the
others unless the electorate deems that man
the best of the lot.
For The Daily's mock election, let us assume
that Allen and Conger of the Hall contingent are
facing James and Brady of the Row.
When the votes are counted for the first time,
Allen leads the race with 500 votes; Conger
has 100; James, 200; and Brady, 400. This is a
total of 1200 votes but no one has a majority,
so the preferential plan takes effect as follows:
Conger is dropped as the low man. His sec
ond choice votes are then counted. Fifty of
these are for Allen, giving him 550. Brady got
25 of them for a 425 total; and James also got
25 for a total of 225. Still no majority. James is
then dropped and his second votes are checked.
His entire second choice went to the other
Row man, Brady, who wins therefore with 625.
Allen ended up with only 550. He led for
two rounds but failed to get a majority because
(a) his own party failed to unanimously sup
port him on second choices, (b) the Row
switched no second-choice votes to his side.
Naturally enough the party leaders want sup
port on both the first and second choices in
asmuch as they will inevitably count for or
against a party in a four-man field. But the
number of men in the running won't affect
the ultimate outcome in any manner.
The preferential ballot is a general and a
primary election in the same contest. Even if
every crack-pot in the University feels that he
should be allowed to run for office, the system
won't be affected. The only danger of the
system not working comes from the inability
of the voters to fathom it.
Undoubtedly you have heard the local ward
heelers say, ''Be sure to vote for that fink Glutz
for second choice, so we don't hurt our
chances!"
Every voter must realize that he should have
an alternate candidate in the event that his
candidate doesn't win a majority. So long as
your candidate is not slashed off the list, his
second votes do not count. But if he is slashed
off, then it would be better to cast a vote for
whom you consider the second best man in
stead of an oily radical or an effeminate con
servative.
The Hall and Row leaders at Stanford have
expressed confidence in the preferential bal
lot and feel sure that the loyal party followers
will support them in both first and second
choice votes. The Independents hope for votes
from both sides, ask for a cutting of party lines.
All the factions, all the parties get a fair deal
so long as the electorate understands the sys
tem. The only ones hurt are the steam-rolling
boys who want no one but their own little pets
to make the race.
The willingness of men to buck caucuses and
the proper use of the preferential ballot is the
only thing that can beat the bosses.

will prove the worth of the Stanford voting sys
tem and the relative ineffectualness of the
caucus when it comes to selecting the outstand
ing candidates. Naturally they are hoping that
a majority of the electorate will take time
enough to write in their man's name.
For the benefit of a good many people on
the campus who still are dubious as to the
preferential ballot's usefulness, The Daily is
giving the following election results in an
effort to show the utter farcicality behind plots
to run only one man per party where two or
more deserve the honor and the chance at
glory. Stanford is fortunate this year in that one
additional Hall (or Independent) man as well
as one extra Row choice is running. All are
capable; no one will hurt the chances of the
others unless the electorate deems that man
the best of the lot.
For The Daily's mock election, let us assume
that Allen and Conger of the Hall contingent are
facing James and Brady of the Row.
When the votes are counted for the first time,
Allen leads the race with 500 votes; Conger
has 100; James, 200; and Brady, 400. This is a
total of 1200 votes but no one has a majority,
so the preferential plan takes effect as follows:
Conger is dropped as the low man. His sec
ond choice votes are then counted. Fifty of
these are for Allen, giving him 550. Brady got
25 of them for a 425 total; and James also got
25 for a total of 225. Still no majority. James is
then dropped and his second votes are checked.
His entire second choice went to the other
Row man, Brady, who wins therefore with 625.
Allen ended up with only 550. He led for
two rounds but failed to get a majority because
(a) his own party failed to unanimously sup
port him on second choices, (b) the Row
switched no second-choice votes to his side.
Naturally enough the party leaders want sup
port on both the first and second choices in
asmuch as they will inevitably count for or
against a party in a four-man field. But the
number of men in the running won't affect
the ultimate outcome in any manner.
The preferential ballot is a general and a
primary election in the same contest. Even if
every crack-pot in the University feels that he
should be allowed to run for office, the system
won't be affected. The only danger of the
system not working comes from the inability
of the voters to fathom it.
Undoubtedly you have heard the local ward
heelers say, ''Be sure to vote for that fink Glutz
for second choice, so we don't hurt our
chances!"
Every voter must realize that he should have
an alternate candidate in the event that his
candidate doesn't win a majority. So long as
your candidate is not slashed off the list, his
second votes do not count. But if he is slashed
off, then it would be better to cast a vote for
whom you consider the second best man in
stead of an oily radical or an effeminate con
servative.
The Hall and Row leaders at Stanford have
expressed confidence in the preferential bal
lot and feel sure that the loyal party followers
will support them in both first and second
choice votes. The Independents hope for votes
from both sides, ask for a cutting of party lines.
All the factions, all the parties get a fair deal
so long as the electorate understands the sys
tem. The only ones hurt are the steam-rolling
boys who want no one but their own little pets
to make the race.
The willingness of men to buck caucuses and
the proper use of the preferential ballot is the
only thing that can beat the bosses.
IT is virtually impossible to split a party under
the preferential ballot election system.
This, of course, is news to the scores of po
litical bosses in present-day and historical Stan
ford who have always felt that the only way to
protect their faction was through the use of the
chug-chug power of a caucus, a pre-caucus for
the more select, and a pre-pre-caucus for the
elite. What goes on before then has escaped
detection.
If Stanford wants proof of the preferential
ballot's strength, she has only to watch the
progress of tomorrow's election. It is unfor
tunate that one of the four outstanding men
for the A.S.S.U. presidency post failed to get
his name on the ballot but those in back of the
latest of the quartet are confident that their man
will prove the worth of the Stanford voting sys

caucus when it comes to selecting the outstand

the best of the lot.
For The Daily's mock election, let us assume
that Allen and Conger of the Hall contingent are
facing James and Brady of the Row.
When the votes are counted for the first time,
Allen leads the race with 500 votes; Conger
has 100; James, 200; and Brady, 400. This is a
total of 1200 votes but no one has a majority,
so the preferential plan takes effect as follows:
Conger is dropped as the low man. His sec
ond choice votes are then counted. Fifty of
these are for Allen, giving him 550. Brady got
25 of them for a 425 total; and James also got
25 for a total of 225. Still no majority. James is
then dropped and his second votes are checked.
His entire second choice went to the other
Row man, Brady, who wins therefore with 625.
Allen ended up with only 550. He led for
two rounds but failed to get a majority because
(a) his own party failed to unanimously sup
port him on second choices, (b) the Row
switched no second-choice votes to his side.
Naturally enough the party leaders want sup
port on both the first and second choices in
asmuch as they will inevitably count for or
against a party in a four-man field. But the
number of men in the running won't affect
the ultimate outcome in any manner.
The preferential ballot is a general and a
primary election in the same contest. Even if
every crack-pot in the University feels that he
should be allowed to run for office, the system
won't be affected. The only danger of the
system not working comes from the inability
of the voters to fathom it.
Undoubtedly you have heard the local ward
heelers say, ''Be sure to vote for that fink Glutz
for second choice, so we don't hurt our
chances!"
Every voter must realize that he should have
an alternate candidate in the event that his
candidate doesn't win a majority. So long as
your candidate is not slashed off the list, his
second votes do not count. But if he is slashed
off, then it would be better to cast a vote for
whom you consider the second best man in
stead of an oily radical or an effeminate con
servative.
The Hall and Row leaders at Stanford have
expressed confidence in the preferential bal
lot and feel sure that the loyal party followers
will support them in both first and second
choice votes. The Independents hope for votes
from both sides, ask for a cutting of party lines.
All the factions, all the parties get a fair deal
so long as the electorate understands the sys
tem. The only ones hurt are the steam-rolling
boys who want no one but their own little pets
to make the race.
The willingness of men to buck caucuses and
the proper use of the preferential ballot is the
only thing that can beat the bosses.
IT is virtually impossible to split a party under
the preferential ballot election system.
This, of course, is news to the scores of po
litical bosses in present-day and historical Stan
ford who have always felt that the only way to
protect their faction was through the use of the
chug-chug power of a caucus, a pre-caucus for
the more select, and a pre-pre-caucus for the
elite. What goes on before then has escaped
detection.
If Stanford wants proof of the preferential
ballot's strength, she has only to watch the
progress of tomorrow's election. It is unfor
tunate that one of the four outstanding men
for the A.S.S.U. presidency post failed to get
his name on the ballot but those in back of the
latest of the quartet are confident that their man
will prove the worth of the Stanford voting sys
tem and the relative ineffectualness of the
caucus when it comes to selecting the outstand
ing candidates. Naturally they are hoping that
a majority of the electorate will take time
enough to write in their man's name.
For the benefit of a good many people on
the campus who still are dubious as to the
preferential ballot's usefulness, The Daily is
giving the following election results in an
effort to show the utter farcicality behind plots
to run only one man per party where two or
more deserve the honor and the chance at
glory. Stanford is fortunate this year in that one
additional Hall (or Independent) man as well
as one extra Row choice is running. All are
capable; no one will hurt the chances of the
others unless the electorate deems that man
the best of the lot.
