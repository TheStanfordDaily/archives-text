THIS is election year—time for political con
ventions. Stanford has a political union.
Therefore Stanford will have a political nomi
nation convention.
The Stanford Political Union, or S.P.U. as it
is commonly termed here, is the off shoot of
the one at Yale, which in turn was inspired by
the one at Oxford, v/here it is closely allied
with the political system of England.

The idea of the union migrated to the cam
pus in the mind of Gerald Marcus, who attended
one of the meetings at Yale while in the East
on a debating tour. Since its organization two
years ago it has run the gamut of vicissitudes
on the campus.
When it first began, it was quite popular,
probably because Stanford likes something new
to play with until the novelty wears off—which
it did. But the leaders, most of whom were
seniors, graduated, leaving the Union to struggle
on, dropped by those whose pleasures are the
things which are being done this season.
Being something worth while, however, it
has continued, not always too successfully but
kept going by the fight of one man, the presi
dent whose responsibility it was to keep it
going. It is not a radical organization; it never
has been. Instead, it is a forum of free speech
where students may receive experience in voic
ing their opinions on current national and in
ternational affairs.
On Wednesday of this week, campus leaders
will lead an open discussion of current national
affairs, a discussion of the men whose hats are
in the Presidential ring for 1940.
