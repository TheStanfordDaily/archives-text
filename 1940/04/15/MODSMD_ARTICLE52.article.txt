### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
THE GREAT WHITE WAY
IVEVV YORK, N.Y. —There are ten stage shows off
Times Square—ten stage shows and twenty mov
ies and a thousand neon signs. And the night looks
like Hollywood's version of night-life. The atmosphere
is actually electrified to the point of whiteness, and
the huge Planter's Peanut sign that butts into every
movie about New York glares down on the most met
ropolitan city blocks in the United States.
For dozens and dozens of blocks around, skyscrap
ers loom like a surrealistic dream—from Park Avenue
and Radio City to the Empire State Building, the Mt.
Everest of the Manhattan ranges. It all has two diverse
effects upon any Western yokel from hamlets like Los
Angeles and San Francisco. It makes one feel small
and countrified. And it sends hyper-thyroid pulsa
tions of high-tension life through one, and makes one
want to imbibe all the excitement, all of the noisy
glitter of "The Great White Way."
These two conflicting feelings are characteristic of
the attitude of New Yorkers. The high-tension livers,
with the money to get the best of New York, look
upon their city as the pinnacle of the twentieth cen
tury—the concentrated acme of all "white ways." And
they feel the need of the stimulation and thrill of a
city of Brobdingnagian splendors.
♦ * * >u
OUT many average New Yorkers feel too small, too
lost in the maze of specializations. And the high
tension harries them and gives them a chronic case of
social nerves. They are smothered by the inexorable
whirr. And they want to breathe slowly and freely
where there is lots of space and lots of natural things
and not so many man-made wonders.
We felt a little sheepish, a little bit like hicks, when
we asked the information clerk at Radio City "just why
Rockefeller built this place." The clerk laughed and
told us, and apologized. "We're from the sticks, as you
can readily tell," we said.
But the clerk didn't feci superior and he didn't
think we were stupid. He envied us. "I wish I lived
in the sticks," he said. "This place moves too damned
fast."
But if you can keep up with the pace, you don't
want to slow down. You want to be in the center of
all the excitement, and you think of smaller places as
duller and slower and behind the times—the New York
times.
But even if you are on top of New York, you must
feel sorry for the millions of regimented sheep for
whom the whirr is only a foot-sore nervous irritation.
A visitor, however, feels above all the incredible
hugeness of the place. And he is always open to the
embarrassment of a boy from the Bronx whom we
saw today. "Whatta ya doin', Gawdge?" his friend
asked him. "Gapin' again?"

city of Brobdingnagian splendors.

OUT many average New Yorkers feel too small, too
lost in the maze of specializations. And the high
tension harries them and gives them a chronic case of
social nerves. They are smothered by the inexorable
whirr. And they want to breathe slowly and freely
where there is lots of space and lots of natural things
and not so many man-made wonders.
We felt a little sheepish, a little bit like hicks, when
we asked the information clerk at Radio City "just why
Rockefeller built this place." The clerk laughed and
told us, and apologized. "We're from the sticks, as you
can readily tell," we said.
But the clerk didn't feci superior and he didn't
think we were stupid. He envied us. "I wish I lived
in the sticks," he said. "This place moves too damned
fast."
But if you can keep up with the pace, you don't
want to slow down. You want to be in the center of
all the excitement, and you think of smaller places as
duller and slower and behind the times—the New York
times.
But even if you are on top of New York, you must
feel sorry for the millions of regimented sheep for
whom the whirr is only a foot-sore nervous irritation.
A visitor, however, feels above all the incredible
hugeness of the place. And he is always open to the
embarrassment of a boy from the Bronx whom we
saw today. "Whatta ya doin', Gawdge?" his friend
asked him. "Gapin' again?"
THE GREAT WHITE WAY
IVEVV YORK, N.Y. —There are ten stage shows off
Times Square—ten stage shows and twenty mov
ies and a thousand neon signs. And the night looks
like Hollywood's version of night-life. The atmosphere
is actually electrified to the point of whiteness, and
the huge Planter's Peanut sign that butts into every
movie about New York glares down on the most met
ropolitan city blocks in the United States.
For dozens and dozens of blocks around, skyscrap
ers loom like a surrealistic dream—from Park Avenue
and Radio City to the Empire State Building, the Mt.
Everest of the Manhattan ranges. It all has two diverse
effects upon any Western yokel from hamlets like Los
Angeles and San Francisco. It makes one feel small
and countrified. And it sends hyper-thyroid pulsa
tions of high-tension life through one, and makes one
want to imbibe all the excitement, all of the noisy
glitter of "The Great White Way."
These two conflicting feelings are characteristic of
the attitude of New Yorkers. The high-tension livers,
with the money to get the best of New York, look
upon their city as the pinnacle of the twentieth cen
tury—the concentrated acme of all "white ways." And
they feel the need of the stimulation and thrill of a
city of Brobdingnagian splendors.
