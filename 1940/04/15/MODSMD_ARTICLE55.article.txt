# ALL IN A BUNCH

### 
Speaking of long shows, one of our girls a few
years ago was sitting through a very long love-story
movie. Women were gasping and sighing all around
her, but she herself just sat there, and her feet went
to sleep.
She started to leave during one of the saddest of a
whole series of sad parts. Only she forgot to wake
her feet up first, and flopped in the aisle.
The audience gave her the razzberry. That dates
that story, doesn't it? Audiences felt more strongly
about things like that in the old days.
