# WISE GUYS

A few of the Stanford boys didn't believe that stuff
about how Bill Ellington's mile relay team was going
to break the worlds record Saturday, and went over
to Cal for the meet there.
They wanted to .see that guy over there who was
going to crack the 440 mark, just the way the Berkeley
propagandists said he was going to.
Yes: he placed third in a slow race, and the boys
left. Skipping the pole vault altogether, they went
over to the baseball game.
Then a guv broke the pole vault record.
And Stanford lost the baseball game.
