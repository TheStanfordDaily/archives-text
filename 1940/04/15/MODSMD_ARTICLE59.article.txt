# 'Pinocchio' Company Set New High in Disney Films
## 
### 
'TINOCCIIIO," now playing at the Stanford Theater.
Yes, it's more charming, more delightful, more Disneyesque than
"Snow White." It's the finest production to date of an unusual, highly
imaginative genius. Of course, its "Pinocchio."
Following the outline of the childhood classic, the amazing Walt Disney

and his staff have added several new,
characters, a few new incidents, and
a number of touches of twentieth
century whimsey.
Chief among the expanded parts
is that of Jiminy Cricket, the debo
nair, worldly-wise little bug who
acts as Pinocchio's official con
science. However, the outstanding
characters are Figaro, the human,
petulant little kitten, and Cleo, the
goldfish with sex appeal.
The villains of the piece, J. Worth
ington Foulfellow, the fox, and his
stooge, Gideon, the cat, are excellent
satiric sketches, and their song, "Hi
diddle-de-de, An Actor's Life for
Me," is the best in the picture.
Gepetto, the kind old wood
carver, Strombolli, the wicked old
puppeteer (who is sufficient excuse
for Mussolini to ban the picture),
Monstro, the terrifying whale, and
Pinocchio himself, the Mickey -
Mouse-juvenile of the picture, all
turn in perfect performances, by
courtesy of their creators.
The animation of the human char
acters in "Pinocchio" is far superior
to that in "Snow White," in which
the lovely heroine and her Prince
Charming jumped around like they
had a mild case of St. Vitus dance.
The smoothness of her animation
even makes it possible to stomach
the new film's saccharine Blue
Fairy.
Brilliant color is used in the car
toon with artistry and taste, and the
quaint, toy-Tyrolian backgrounds
are things of real beauty. Spectacu
lar, miniature miracles are the
scenes when all the mechanical
clocks in the toyshop strike, the
elaborate puppet show, and the un
derwater search for Monstro, the
whale.
"Pinocchio" is far more than a
breath-taking technical achieve
ment. It is a near-perfect example
of fantasy, and probably the finest
thing that the movies have ever ac
complished in that field.
By this time evei'yone knows
that Disney's pictures are not made
for an exclusively pre-adolescent
audience. Anyone who is too blase
to enjoy "Pinocchio" had better shoot
himself.—Livingston

to enjoy "Pinocchio" had better shoot
himself.—Livingston
'TINOCCIIIO," now playing at the Stanford Theater.
Yes, it's more charming, more delightful, more Disneyesque than
"Snow White." It's the finest production to date of an unusual, highly
imaginative genius. Of course, its "Pinocchio."
Following the outline of the childhood classic, the amazing Walt Disney

and his staff have added several new,
characters, a few new incidents, and
a number of touches of twentieth
century whimsey.
Chief among the expanded parts
is that of Jiminy Cricket, the debo
nair, worldly-wise little bug who
acts as Pinocchio's official con
science. However, the outstanding
characters are Figaro, the human,
petulant little kitten, and Cleo, the
goldfish with sex appeal.
The villains of the piece, J. Worth
ington Foulfellow, the fox, and his
stooge, Gideon, the cat, are excellent
satiric sketches, and their song, "Hi
diddle-de-de, An Actor's Life for
Me," is the best in the picture.
Gepetto, the kind old wood
carver, Strombolli, the wicked old
puppeteer (who is sufficient excuse
for Mussolini to ban the picture),
Monstro, the terrifying whale, and
Pinocchio himself, the Mickey -
Mouse-juvenile of the picture, all
turn in perfect performances, by
courtesy of their creators.
The animation of the human char
acters in "Pinocchio" is far superior
to that in "Snow White," in which
the lovely heroine and her Prince
Charming jumped around like they
had a mild case of St. Vitus dance.
The smoothness of her animation
even makes it possible to stomach
the new film's saccharine Blue
Fairy.
Brilliant color is used in the car
toon with artistry and taste, and the
quaint, toy-Tyrolian backgrounds
are things of real beauty. Spectacu
lar, miniature miracles are the
scenes when all the mechanical
clocks in the toyshop strike, the
elaborate puppet show, and the un
derwater search for Monstro, the
whale.
"Pinocchio" is far more than a
breath-taking technical achieve
ment. It is a near-perfect example
of fantasy, and probably the finest
thing that the movies have ever ac
complished in that field.
