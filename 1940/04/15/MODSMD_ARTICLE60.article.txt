# Mysterious Fire Burns Encina Car
## 
### 
Fire of mysterious origin rated a
car parked in Ihe Encina Bull Pen
early hist night and was put out by
the campus fire department only
after the car had been reduced to
practically a total loss.
Water bags flung from Encina
windows in the early stages of the
fire failed to halt the headway of the
flames.
The car, jacked up and apparently
under repair, belongs to an employee
of the Encina Commons. The car
was valued at about $250.
