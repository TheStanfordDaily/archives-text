# 'Jo' Haskell Aids Stanford Dance Addicts
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Most Stanford women have some
thing or other to say on the subject
of Modern Dance. These comments
can usually be divided into three
general categories as follows:
(a) Took it to fill the dance re
quirement and it nearly killed me;
(b) Saw the condition my room
mate was in from it so took some
thing else; (c) Took it, found it did
n't actually kill me, and got to like
it so well that I'm taking it again.
Those in the last category — the
strong ones who didn't fall by the
wayside—are giving the whole
campus a demonstration of what you
can do with modern dance once you
got past the charlie-horse stage.
This is the annual Orchesis and
Junior Orchesis concert which will
be given tomorrow night in Memo
rial Hall.
PROLIFIC COMPOSER
In charge of the affair will be Miss
Margaret Jewell, dance instructor,
and at the piano will be Josephine
Haskell, "Jo" to the dancers who
toil thrice weekly to the strains of
her piano. She's a prolific composer,
is Jo, and nine of the compositions
being given tomorrow night will be
danced to her music. As a matter of
fact, the only two composers, not
named Haskell, who will be repre
sented in the program arc named
Traditional and Shostakovitch.
"In composing for a dance the
mood is most important," she says,
lightly dismissing the minor points
about being able to compose at all.
"The girls work out the dance, then
they dance it for me and we work
out the time together. Then I go
home and compose the music, see
ing, always, that the music takes on
the emotional quality of the dance
it's for."
POSES PLEASANTLY
Here she stopped, at the photog
rapher's request, and smiled pleas
antly for an interim while he fina
gled his camera into a position
where he could include both Miss
Haskell and two dancers who were
poised rather precariously, each on
one leg.
Continuing, she pointed out that
the moods in this concert's composi
tions range through satire, ridicule,
triumph to deep tragedy. "If you
compose for dancers, you must be
versatile if nothing else," she com
mented.
THEATER PIANIST
Jo began accompanying for Stan
ford's dance classes four years ago,
but she didn't begin her composing
activities until a year after her de
but when Miss Jewell took over the
modern dance instructorship here.
She finds her work as a theater
pianist, during the silent movie days
invaluable, because most of the mu
sic for vaudeville skits (remember
vaudeville?) was in script; thus
reading her own script now is not
so difficult.
What bothers incipient Stanford
dancers most is how she managers to
accompany the various violent, and
mild exercises Miss Jewell puts them
through at. the drop of a hint. Miss
Jewell demonstrates what she is go
ing to do; the class starts to emu
late more or less; and immediately
Jo swings into an absolutely appro
priate accompaniment.
"Miss Jewell's instructions to the
class are mine, too," she says. "I just
improvise along."
