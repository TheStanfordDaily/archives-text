W/HICH camfc first, the chicken or
the egg?
A generation back this question
was tops as a national brain teaser.
But during the past five years its
place has been taken over by:
Which is the backbone of the
fleet, the battleship or naval air
craft?
Yesterday the naval question ap
peared solved.
Speaking before the Senate Naval
Affairs Committee, Admiral Har
old R. Stark gave the navy's official
answer. And the battlewagon won.
Stark (and the navy), did not
forget the airfleet, however. In
stead, lie had nothing hut praise
for the airdogs. But he admitted
that tacticians felt the battleship
to be the superior offensive and
defensive weapon.
He qualified his statement a mo
ment later. "Aircraft alone, or bat
tleships alone, cannot control the
sea. Together . . . they can."
Then as pro-battleships believers
swelled silently, and mollified pro
ponents of naval aircraft relaxed,
Stark subtly tossed a few verbal
bombs into the collective lap of the
committee. Some bombs were good,
some were duds, and some were in
different.

1/fOST explosive of these was the
surprising unofficial statement
that unless expansion of the Amer
ican fleet soon become realized, Jap
anese naval strength would come
"uncomfortably close" to that of the
United States.
"Uncomfortably close" meaning
that the Stars and Stripes would no
longer be unquestionably supreme
in the Pacific. Meaning possibility of
the Rising Sun spreading its rays to
include the Philippines and other
portions of Oceania. Meaning possi
bility, in case of war, of Japanese
conlrol over Hawaii.
Stark claimed no absolute in
formation concerning Japan's nav
al construction. But with sure,
swift sentences he drew a picture
centered about almost complete
naval equality between these two
nations . . . unless something
happens soon.
He took an indirect slap at the
pending Vinson naval bill, soon to
come before Congress. Aid the
committee listened attentively as he
claimed that the Vinson bill's 11 per
cent increase in the fleet is less than
one-half the needed increase.
Then, belore committee members
had a chance to think things over,
Stalk committed a right-about-face,
this time to toss a bouquet in the
general direction of the navy.

MOST imposing bunch of roses
included a statement that
American-made warplanes, older
and slower than those now used by
the U. S. army and navy, are out
fighting Germany's finest combat
planes.
(Stark was referring, indirectly, to
successful use of American aircraft
nations . . . unless something
Allies. During the past six months
America has shipped many planes
for foreign use. Luckily enough, al
most each shipment has been im
mediately preceded by an improve
ment. by American aircraft engi
neers. Which still leaves the United
States with the cream of the crop.
In what was perhaps the first
public admission that army ex
perts have been tinkering with a
new super-explosive, Stark claim
ed that no improvement had yet
been found. TNT is evidently still
tops in the explosive field.
What particularly interested for
eign observers was an inched-in
statement concerning the present
conflict on the Western Front. Stark
said flatly that the Reich's vaunted
air force was helpless because its air
bases are too far from British bases.
Informally quizzed after the meet
ing, Stark made no comment on lat
est German advances into Norway
and Denmark . . . and the possible
advantage they would give the Reich
