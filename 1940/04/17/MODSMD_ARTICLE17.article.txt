# JESSUP, TOWNSEND WIN ELECTION
## Row Chalks Up Victory; Takes Fourteen Offices To Halls Nine; 2,111 Vote Gore Voted Senior Class President As Hutchinson, Boggs Take Excom Posts; No Write-in Candidates Win 
### 
Bruce Jessup, Beta, and official Row nominee, today became the now
president of Stanford's Associated Students as approximately 2,111 voters
went to the polls to select their next year's representatives.
Sweeping 14 nominees into ofTice, the Row chalked a clear victory
over the Halls' nine elected officials. Last year, for 29 jobs, the Row tri-

umphed 15-14.
Anne Townsend, Lagunita, an
easy favorite, became Vice-Pre.si
dent of the Associated Students to
succeed Colleen Upshaw. She was
opposed by Betty Moses, Pi Phi.
Jessup, it w/ts revealed yesterday,
enrolled for spiing quarter Monday,
carrying 13 units. Since he had
completed his junior requirements
at the end of winter quarter, he
planned not to enroll in school again
until next fall. President Ray Ly
man Wilbur advised him, however,
that to be eligible to run he must bo
enrolled and a member of the Asso
ciated Students at the time of the
election.
Significant was the fact that no
write-in candidate was elected to the
ofTice he sought, commented Election
Chairman Bill Leckie tonight.
Today's balloting was larger than
last year's 1,782 by about 240 votes.
It topped the previous year's record
of 2,033 by approximately 78 ballots.
Close rivalry occurred in several
Ex Committee posts. Bill Turner,
Delt, who did not receive the Row's
nomination, narrowed Dwighi
Hutchinson's lead as second choice
votes were considered, but failed to
triumph. Widney Watson, Lagunita.
lost to Muriel Boggs, Alpha Phi, by
148 votes.
Ninety-six votes, separated Jes
sup and his nearest contestant, John
Alltucker, Hall nominee, as first
choice votes were considered.
Art Gore, Phi Delt, won over both
Stan Glikbarg, Hall nominee, and
Bob Newell, write-in and S.A.E., for
the post of Senior Class President.
