### MARY JUDSON 
Hubert Heffner's brown eyes shone enthusiastically behind his glasses
as he punctuated each statement with an expressive wave of his hand.
"1 came to Stanford to head the Drama Division because 1 saw here
an opportunity to build up one of the outstanding theaters of America.
I can see on the West Coast the coming field of culture. Here we have

scope and enthusiasm which is fresh
and new.'
With this opening statement Pro
fessor HefTner sat back and pro
ceeded to outline his hopes for Stan
ford's drama future.
Coming' to the Farm after nine
years as head of Northwestern's
theater department, Mr. HefTner
brings with him years of experience
in the theater from his undergrad
uate days at North Carolina through
his work as an actor, writer, direc
tor and teacher of dramatics, up to
his present task of building Stanford
into a Coast drama center.
TALENT FROM DUMPS
"Stanford has a great founda
tion," Mr. Heffner continued. "But
that foundation is a great dramatic
plant, and you can't do everything
on a material basis, some of thn
greatest work has come out of
dumps. What we want to build up
is an outstanding faculty to bring
out the best in outstanding stu
dents.
By building up the drama staff
and in consequence the courses,
Stanford will attract the best cali
ber drama student, according to Mr.
HefTner. Setting a standard in in
struction will lead to excellence in
every art field. The great problem
is now to build up.
NEED FARM SUPPORT
"We need the support and inter
est of the whole university to make
Stanford a leader in the drama
field," Mr. Heffner declared. "We
don't want just those who are in
terested in the theater as a career;
we need the help and interest of
everyone in the community."
His first step is to give the audi
ence good shows. This means giving
them what they like and also some
of what they don't know they like.
A balanced diet in drama is the goal
of every theater, big or small. Dif
ferent kinds of productions not only
uive the actor experience, but also
educate the audience in many
subjects.
