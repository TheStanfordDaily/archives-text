# Economic Inequality Blamed For Present European War
## 
### WALT STOESSEL 
The present war is being fought
because of the economic inequality
which exists in the present-day set
up in Europe. Many of Germany's
claims have a basis of truth, and it
cannot be denied that Great Britain
is fighting this war to preserve the
Empire.
It is barely possible that a peace
may be arrived at which would
stipulate disarmament and embody
the principle of collective security in
Europe, if no military action is taken
for some months. But the chances
are slight. England would have to
back down, and lose too much pres
tige to agree to the German demands.
TOOTH AND NAIL
But if no peace is made the out
look indeed seems hopeless for the
future. If England wins, any peace
plan for the reorganization of Ger
many which England would try to
put into effect would be opposed
tooth and nail by the German people.
To get rid of Hitler, which is the
avowed aim of Ihe Allies, would ac
complish little. The German people
have been too thoroughly inocu
lated with Nazi philosophies ever to
knuckle under to the English. With
the collapse of the totalitarian state
would come terrific economic dislo
cation, the possible advance of com
munism, and a situation which
would inevitably produce a war
like avenger of Germany's wrongs
within 15 years.
BETTER OUT'
Although the majority of Euro
peans believe that the United States
will come into the war within a few
months, America could be of more
service by staying out. America
could act as a humanitarian agent,
help with the reorganization and
peace plans—but for the present we
have no business in the European
mess.
To say that this country has a
moral duty to defend democracy is
a sad joke. The sooner the American
people arouse themselves and be
come excited about staying out of
Europe the better.
ECONOMIC WAR
This is an economic war, brought
about as much by the selfish and
hesitant policy of Great Britain as
by the land-grabbing of Hitler. Even
if Germany won, which at the mo
ment seems quite oo.ssible, the idea
of a Nazi danger to the United States

)is sheer nonsense. Our best defense
1 against the spread of the totalitarian
j philosophies is education of the peo
l pie within our own borders—not by
; an expeditionary force to Europe.
