# Simpson Fights Dewey Support
## Stassen to Keynote Republican Parley 
### 
PHILADELPHIA. April 16 (UP).
—Gov. Harold E. Stassen of Minne
sota was selected keynote speaker
for the Republican National Con
vention today as Kenneth F. Simp
son, national G.O.P. committeeman
from New York, promised "a hell
of a fight" against what he described
as an attempt by Dewey-for-Presi
dent managers to purge him from
the Republican party leadership.
Stassen, 33, is regarded as a pos
sible Republican presidential can
didate in 1944.
Rep. Joseph W. Martin of Massa
chusetts, minority floor leader, was
selected as the convention's perma
nent chairman.
Simpson stole the show, however,
because of the possibility the New
York party row may develop into a
stop-Dewey movement within the
92-vote delegation which will rep
resent the state at the nominating
gathering on June 24.
''My present plan is not to inject
any presidential candidate into the
purge fight," Simpson said in ex
plaining he would stump the state
in a campaign to prevent his re
moval from the national committee
post.
Simpson's emphasis upon the
word "present," suggested to his
questioners that the national com
mittee contest may develop before
convention time into a direct chal
lenge to Dewey's candidacy in his
home state.
The jinriksha was invented in 1871
by an American, the Rev. Mr. Jona
than Goble, a Baptist missionary in
Yokohama.
