# Ex Committee Approves Sun Deck for Boathouse; Athletic Awards Granted
## Members Override Manager Cobbs In Controversy; Cost of Addition Estimated at Eighty-four Dollars 
### DICK DUDMAN 
Ex Committee last night handed local sun bathers the Boathouse sun
deck it had snatched away the week before.
Reopening its discussion of the issue, the committee authorized the
necessary appropriation for boarding over the unfinished north roof of
the Boathouse.
Student Manager John Cohhs stood alone in opposition to the new
deck, proposed in recent Daily editorials. He said the estimated $84 should

not be spent until more ol the
nal expense has been paid off.
Discussion was reopened at the
suggestion of Bob Low, who made
a new motion proposing the im
provement.
ANDERSON CHANGES
Burroughs Anderson, who op
posed the new deck last week, said
he had changed his mind after talk
ing to the Boathouse attendants and
finding all three in favor of it.
"It was so crowded last week-end
that people had to crawl over one
another," M. J. Montgomery re
ported.
"1 was up there last Saturday, and
there was just a pleasant little
crowd, a very nice comfortable little
crowd," Cobbs declared.
"We have a whale of an investment
up there, and we're putting too much
money into it," he continued. "This
L> just another in the succession of
expenses that have been coming up.
END OF LINE
"It's not that I want the student
body to sleep on gravel, but I just
think we've come to what should be
the end of the line."
After the committee had passed
the motion, Cobbs, who has no vote,
said he wanted to "go on record as
opposed to putting any more money
into that damn' chicken coop."

Ex Committee last night handed local sun bathers the Boathouse sun
deck it had snatched away the week before.
Reopening its discussion of the issue, the committee authorized the
necessary appropriation for boarding over the unfinished north roof of
the Boathouse.
Student Manager John Cohhs stood alone in opposition to the new
deck, proposed in recent Daily editorials. He said the estimated $84 should

not be spent until more ol the
nal expense has been paid off.
Discussion was reopened at the
suggestion of Bob Low, who made
a new motion proposing the im
provement.

Burroughs Anderson, who op
posed the new deck last week, said
he had changed his mind after talk

"1 was up there last Saturday, and
there was just a pleasant little
crowd, a very nice comfortable little
crowd," Cobbs declared.
"We have a whale of an investment
