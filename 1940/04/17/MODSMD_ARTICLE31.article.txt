# SIDELINE SLANTS

### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Everyone is so used to seeing the
Trojans of Southern California j
ranked among the top five in sport
after sport, that it may be a sur
prise to them except to a select golf
ing group that El Troje doesn't rate
with Stanford on the links. Nor does I
any other team in the country stack j
up with Coach Eddie Twiggs' divot !
diggers.
* « >H
IT USED TO BE that the Ivy
Leaguers and other Eastern and
Mid-Western universities were their
own self-appointed champions of
the nation in the various sports.
That was until Stanford, California,
and U.S.C. came out year after year
to thresh them in football, basket
ball, track, and now golf.
For the past two Junes, Stanford
has sent six representatives to the
National Coilegiates and come back ,
twice with the team title. And in
sending out six each year, a mini- i
her of excellent golfers had to be
left behind . . . but that couldn't
be helped.
That same situation is inevitable I
this June, because Eddie has a j
formidable array, and from one '
match to the next and week to week I
the standings which he posts inside !
the pro shop on the University
course are constantly shifting. So '
by June there's going to be a lot of
effort being put in by these men to
make that trip to the N.C.2A. cham
pionships.
* * *
HOWEVER. THE B.A.C. is hesi
tating about sending Twiggs and his
six men back for the reason that it
costs money which the Board hasn't
got.
We'd like to see a lot of our
various teams make that eastern
trek this spring. There's the track
men and the tennis squad, besides
the golf contingent.
But the chances are that for the
money, the golf team would really i
make the best showing. And any- j
way, the track team has given up
hope for a trip to the 1.C.4A. So i
maybe a little dope about the golfers |
will help their case out.

IN THREE COLLEGIATE matches
here on the Coast, which gave the
Farm the Southern Division cham- '
pionship, the opponents compiled a I
stupendous total of 7 1 •> points—lV2 i
each to U.S.C., U.C.L.A., and Cali- 1
fornia. Stanford's totals were 24 1 :» j
each.
This Saturday Warren Berl, Don
Kennedy, and company will go to
the Clareniont course in Berkeley
for a return match with the Bears,
whom they humiliated last Satur
day 011 our course. In that first
match the first four men all came
in with scores of 75 or better.
They were Berl. Kennedy, Gordon
Hough, a jaysee transfer from
Citrus, and Frank Tatum.
Guy Showley and George Brad
ley held down the rest of the singles, !
while Hal Stone, Jack Showalter. ;
Sherm Selix, and Don Haslett team
ed in doubles. To show you how
those standings fluctuate from week
to week, Stone and Showalter play
ed singles against the Trojans and
Bruins. Yes indeed, there's compe
tition here.
• ♦ *
IT'S A TOSS-UP whether the

B.A.C. will hand out that $1000 to
send the boys back, but it's a cinch
the university can't lose, what with
the swell advertising it gets. Yearly
the easterners are impressed by the
sportsmanship and fine play of the
Farm representatives.
Coach Twiggs is widely recog
nized as one of the best colle
giate coaches in the business. He
tells me that his team last June
at the VVakonda course, Des
Miancs, lowa, was the most publi
cized at the N.C.2A. champion
ships.
The Des Moines newspapers had
big picture layouts of Twiggs, the
team, and single pictures of Berl,
who became runner-up in the indi
vidual play. Berl is one of the out
standing choices for the crown this
June —if he goes.
And to add to Stanford's golf
ing publicity, the Farm will be
hosts to the N.C.2A. in 1942, if
present plans don't fall through.

National Coilegiates and come back ,
twice with the team title. And in
sending out six each year, a mini- i
her of excellent golfers had to be
left behind . . . but that couldn't
be helped.
That same situation is inevitable I
this June, because Eddie has a j
formidable array, and from one '
match to the next and week to week I
the standings which he posts inside !
the pro shop on the University
course are constantly shifting. So '
by June there's going to be a lot of
effort being put in by these men to
make that trip to the N.C.2A. cham
pionships.
* * *
HOWEVER. THE B.A.C. is hesi
tating about sending Twiggs and his
six men back for the reason that it
costs money which the Board hasn't
got.
We'd like to see a lot of our
various teams make that eastern
trek this spring. There's the track
men and the tennis squad, besides
the golf contingent.
But the chances are that for the
money, the golf team would really i
make the best showing. And any- j
way, the track team has given up
hope for a trip to the 1.C.4A. So i
maybe a little dope about the golfers |
will help their case out.

IN THREE COLLEGIATE matches
here on the Coast, which gave the
Farm the Southern Division cham- '
pionship, the opponents compiled a I
stupendous total of 7 1 •> points—lV2 i
each to U.S.C., U.C.L.A., and Cali- 1
fornia. Stanford's totals were 24 1 :» j
each.
This Saturday Warren Berl, Don
Kennedy, and company will go to
the Clareniont course in Berkeley
for a return match with the Bears,
whom they humiliated last Satur
day 011 our course. In that first
match the first four men all came
in with scores of 75 or better.
They were Berl. Kennedy, Gordon
Hough, a jaysee transfer from
Citrus, and Frank Tatum.
Guy Showley and George Brad
ley held down the rest of the singles, !
while Hal Stone, Jack Showalter. ;
Sherm Selix, and Don Haslett team
ed in doubles. To show you how
those standings fluctuate from week
to week, Stone and Showalter play
ed singles against the Trojans and
Bruins. Yes indeed, there's compe
tition here.

IT'S A TOSS-UP whether the

B.A.C. will hand out that $1000 to
send the boys back, but it's a cinch
the university can't lose, what with
the swell advertising it gets. Yearly
the easterners are impressed by the
sportsmanship and fine play of the
Farm representatives.
Coach Twiggs is widely recog
nized as one of the best colle
giate coaches in the business. He
tells me that his team last June
at the VVakonda course, Des
Miancs, lowa, was the most publi
cized at the N.C.2A. champion
ships.
The Des Moines newspapers had
big picture layouts of Twiggs, the
team, and single pictures of Berl,
who became runner-up in the indi
vidual play. Berl is one of the out
standing choices for the crown this
June —if he goes.
And to add to Stanford's golf
ing publicity, the Farm will be
hosts to the N.C.2A. in 1942, if
present plans don't fall through.
Everyone is so used to seeing the
Trojans of Southern California j
ranked among the top five in sport
after sport, that it may be a sur
prise to them except to a select golf
ing group that El Troje doesn't rate
with Stanford on the links. Nor does I
any other team in the country stack j

costs money which the Board hasn't
got.
We'd like to see a lot of our
various teams make that eastern
trek this spring. There's the track
men and the tennis squad, besides
the golf contingent.
But the chances are that for the
money, the golf team would really i
make the best showing. And any- j
way, the track team has given up
hope for a trip to the 1.C.4A. So i
maybe a little dope about the golfers |
will help their case out.

IN THREE COLLEGIATE matches
here on the Coast, which gave the
Farm the Southern Division cham- '
pionship, the opponents compiled a I
stupendous total of 7 1 •> points—lV2 i
each to U.S.C., U.C.L.A., and Cali- 1
fornia. Stanford's totals were 24 1 :» j
each.
This Saturday Warren Berl, Don
Kennedy, and company will go to
the Clareniont course in Berkeley
for a return match with the Bears,
whom they humiliated last Satur
day 011 our course. In that first
match the first four men all came
in with scores of 75 or better.
They were Berl. Kennedy, Gordon
Hough, a jaysee transfer from
Citrus, and Frank Tatum.
Guy Showley and George Brad
ley held down the rest of the singles, !
while Hal Stone, Jack Showalter. ;
Sherm Selix, and Don Haslett team
ed in doubles. To show you how
those standings fluctuate from week
to week, Stone and Showalter play
ed singles against the Trojans and
Bruins. Yes indeed, there's compe
tition here.

IT'S A TOSS-UP whether the

B.A.C. will hand out that $1000 to
send the boys back, but it's a cinch
the university can't lose, what with
the swell advertising it gets. Yearly
the easterners are impressed by the
sportsmanship and fine play of the
Farm representatives.
Coach Twiggs is widely recog
nized as one of the best colle
giate coaches in the business. He
tells me that his team last June
at the VVakonda course, Des
Miancs, lowa, was the most publi
cized at the N.C.2A. champion
ships.
The Des Moines newspapers had
big picture layouts of Twiggs, the
team, and single pictures of Berl,
who became runner-up in the indi
vidual play. Berl is one of the out
standing choices for the crown this
June —if he goes.
And to add to Stanford's golf
ing publicity, the Farm will be
hosts to the N.C.2A. in 1942, if
present plans don't fall through.
Everyone is so used to seeing the
Trojans of Southern California j
ranked among the top five in sport
after sport, that it may be a sur
prise to them except to a select golf
ing group that El Troje doesn't rate
with Stanford on the links. Nor does I
any other team in the country stack j
up with Coach Eddie Twiggs' divot !
diggers.

IT USED TO BE that the Ivy
Leaguers and other Eastern and
Mid-Western universities were their
own self-appointed champions of
the nation in the various sports.
That was until Stanford, California,
and U.S.C. came out year after year
to thresh them in football, basket
ball, track, and now golf.
For the past two Junes, Stanford
has sent six representatives to the
National Coilegiates and come back ,
twice with the team title. And in
sending out six each year, a mini- i
her of excellent golfers had to be
left behind . . . but that couldn't
be helped.
That same situation is inevitable I
this June, because Eddie has a j
formidable array, and from one '
match to the next and week to week I
the standings which he posts inside !
the pro shop on the University
course are constantly shifting. So '
by June there's going to be a lot of
effort being put in by these men to
make that trip to the N.C.2A. cham
pionships.
