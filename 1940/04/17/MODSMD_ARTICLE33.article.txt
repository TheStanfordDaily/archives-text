# Indian Gridders Practice New System of Play
## 
### 
Concentrating for over an hour !
on fundamentals. Clark Shaugh
nessy sent his Indian gridders
through the only open workout
of the week yesterday afternoon
on the practice field. About 50 j
spectators watched the squad go j
through its paces.
The players circulated among j
three groups working on the tack- i
; ling dummies, the blocking dum
j mies, and practicing live tackling.
The second half of the session was
, spent running through dummy
: scrimmage.
Ragged ball-handling has marked
j most of the drills so far, as the J
; backs are still unaccustomed to the |
! new system. With the quarterback
j taking the ball from center on ev
ery play Coach Shaughnessy has
j given the squad, there's a lot of
razzle-dazzle behind the line.
The new formations have caused
| several backfield shifts. Frankie
Albert, a left half last fall, is at
quarter now. Hugh Gallarneau has
moved from right to left half, and
| Pete Kmetovic from left to right.
Chuck Taylor, star frosh quarter
last year, has been moved to tackle, j
The red-head was an all-P.A.L.
| tackle in his high school days at
j San Jose.
Bill Willard, who was hurt a few
j minutes before the Oregon State
I opener last fall, had his bad knee
j operated on last week. The carving
was pronounced "successful," but it j
is not known whether or not Wil
lard will be able to play ball next
season.
