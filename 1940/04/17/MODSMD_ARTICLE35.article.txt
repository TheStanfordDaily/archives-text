# Cootie May Pitch At Cal Saturday
## 
### 
When Coach Harry Wolter sends
his Stanford baseballers against the
University of California Saturday at
Berkeley in Ihe second game of the
annual Big Game series, the chances
are that "Cootie" Thompson will
again be on the hill for the Indians.
Although Wolter might gamble,
and use his ace hurler against U.S.C.
in the final game of that series Mon
day in an effort to cop at least one
series this year, that move seems
doubtful. In all probability either
Claude Purkitt, Russ Smith, or Bill
Masters will fling for the Indians
against the Trojans.
Stanford can still win the Cal se
ries—a feat an Indian nine hasn't
accomplished for many a moon
