# Moore Plans New Assault On Record
## 
### 
Just last Saturday four members
<;f Stanford's track team went out
and with malice aforethought
broke a world's record.
And again today one of Stanford's
star performers, Paul Moore, en
dorsed by Coach Bill Ellington just
as the Card relay team was on Sat
urday, will make a planned assault
on another world mark.
Ellington expects Paul to shatter
the record in the three-quarter-mile
run of Jules Ladoumegue of 3:00.(5
if conditions are just right. Last
week in practice, Paul ran an ap
parently effortless three laps in 3:
02.6. That is why Ellington thinks
that he can lower the accepted world
record if he sets his mind to it and
has Mushy Girard at his heels push
ing him most of the wi'y around.
NOT MUCH TROUBLE
The world-beating effort will take
place at 4:30 this afternoon on An
gell Field as the first event of a
regularly scheduled dual meet with
San Jose State. Though Ellington
and his crew don't expect to have
much trouble or competition with
the San Jose team, it will be a good
opportunity for the Indians to stretch
their legs this week. They will have
no meet this week-end and instead
will play the part of interested spec
tators at the U.S.C.-California duai
meet in Berkeley.
The Spartans will send their dis
tance ace, Ruble, into the classic
three-quarter-mile today. Ruble is
capable of 4:26 in the mile and of
1:58 in the half-mile. Rather weak in
the track events the invaders have
Kerr, a 10 and 22 fiat sprinter; Sie
mon, another 10 flat hundred man
and a 2.8 low hurdler.
SPARTANS STRONG
However, in the field events the
Spartans are noticeably stronger.
Presley hurled the shot just a half
an inch short of 50 feet last Saturday
against Fresno State. Sunseri
cleared 13 feet 6 inches in the pole
vault against Fresno and Vaseon
cellos leaped 23 feet 4>2 inches in the
broad jump.
These few stars can hardly expect
to dent the Cardinal juggernaut for
more than 30 or 35 points in a reg
ular meet. Yet it will be worth while
lor Farm track fans to come out in
the cool of the afternoon to watch
taking the next two games from the
Bears.

ular meet. Yet it will be worth while
lor Farm track fans to come out in
the cool of the afternoon to watch
taking the next two games from the
Bears.
Just last Saturday four members
<;f Stanford's track team went out
and with malice aforethought
broke a world's record.
And again today one of Stanford's
star performers, Paul Moore, en
dorsed by Coach Bill Ellington just
as the Card relay team was on Sat
urday, will make a planned assault
on another world mark.
Ellington expects Paul to shatter
the record in the three-quarter-mile
run of Jules Ladoumegue of 3:00.(5
if conditions are just right. Last
week in practice, Paul ran an ap
parently effortless three laps in 3:
02.6. That is why Ellington thinks
that he can lower the accepted world
record if he sets his mind to it and
has Mushy Girard at his heels push
ing him most of the wi'y around.
NOT MUCH TROUBLE
The world-beating effort will take
place at 4:30 this afternoon on An
gell Field as the first event of a
regularly scheduled dual meet with
San Jose State. Though Ellington
and his crew don't expect to have
much trouble or competition with
the San Jose team, it will be a good
opportunity for the Indians to stretch
their legs this week. They will have
no meet this week-end and instead
will play the part of interested spec
tators at the U.S.C.-California duai
meet in Berkeley.
The Spartans will send their dis
tance ace, Ruble, into the classic
three-quarter-mile today. Ruble is
capable of 4:26 in the mile and of
1:58 in the half-mile. Rather weak in
the track events the invaders have
Kerr, a 10 and 22 fiat sprinter; Sie
mon, another 10 flat hundred man
and a 2.8 low hurdler.
SPARTANS STRONG
However, in the field events the
Spartans are noticeably stronger.
Presley hurled the shot just a half
an inch short of 50 feet last Saturday
against Fresno State. Sunseri
cleared 13 feet 6 inches in the pole
vault against Fresno and Vaseon
cellos leaped 23 feet 4>2 inches in the
broad jump.
These few stars can hardly expect
to dent the Cardinal juggernaut for
more than 30 or 35 points in a reg
ular meet. Yet it will be worth while
lor Farm track fans to come out in
the cool of the afternoon to watch
taking the next two games from the
