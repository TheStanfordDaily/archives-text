# Frosh Cindermen Plan Triple Meet
## 
### 
As if one junior college wasn't
enough for a week-end's competi
tion, Jack Weiershauser's freshman
cinder squad takes on Menlo J. C.
and Stockton J. C. in a triangular
meet this Saturday at Angell Field.
Zip Walt's 2:01.t> last Saturday was
his best time for the half-mile yet
this season, although he took second
behind Modesto's middle distance
