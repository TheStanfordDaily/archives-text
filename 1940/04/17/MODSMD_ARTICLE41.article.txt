# Stretching a Point
## 
### 
EX COMMITTEE is to be commended for
changing its mind last night.
If it had clung to its original ruling, Stanford
might have lived for years in the shadow of
an unfinished Boathouse. Because Excom
showed a willingness to use the woman's pre
rogative, we can now bask on twice as much
space as we had before. And a lazy guy lying
in the sun does not like to be trampled over
by a hundred other sol-worshippers who have
been deprived of a two-by-four piece of floor.
Stanford in the spring is lazy and likes to stretch.
Ex Committee, by recognizing this fact, has now
established a principle that sun-bathing and
canoeing are as integral a part of this term as
are books and syllabus fees.
Disregarding the recreational benefits of the
coming second sun - porch construction, Ex
Committee has also recognized that more
people can now get vantage points for the
Boathouse Days and Water Carnivals in the
years to come. There will be no unbalanced
loads of spectators on the top of Boathouse II
such as doomed Boathouse I to a watery death.
Naturally enough, the expenditure of an ad
ditional $85 where S5OOO is still due does not
sound like logical budgeting until the deeper
aspects of the problem are considered. That
extra apportionment is merely going to build
something that should have been included in
the original estimates. More of us go to Lake
Lagunita to lounge than to row, and the fact
that our highest tribunal recognizes that fact is
a tribute to the God of the Sunâ€”and to our own
innate laziness.
