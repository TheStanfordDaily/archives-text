# Town Hall Tonight
## 
### 
TONIGHT at 7:30 the Stanford Political Union
will conduct a presidential nominating con
vention in a preview of midsummer's national
party confabs.
The Union has been fighting with its back
against the wall, and it has been a fight made
all the more difficult because of shortsighted
ness and the lack of interest people have in any
thing beyond their own personal world.
This convention is an attempt to create some
interest in the Union among the student body
by having six student leaders support and
defend their candidates in short open speeches.
When these speakers have set the pace for
the convention, the entire audience will join in
the debate, either refuting or supporting "favor
ite son" candidates. At the close of this debate,
the whole assembly will vote to determine
whether Stanford favors a Republican, a Demo
cratic, or a third-term candidate.
The S.P.U. in general and this convention in
particular fulfill the need on this campus of a
public forum where the students may express
their ideas on current national affairs and gain
a great deal of valuable knowledge and expe
rience in organizing and presenting their ideas
to strangers in such a manner that it is inter
esting and understandable.
If Stanford, by which I mean the men and
women who make up the University, is inter
ested in something besides running down the
highway, or paddling a canoe around the lake,
or tripping lightly up to the City for dancing,
here is a cause and an organization which
should be supported. But most of all here is a
chance to lift our noses from our own special
penny-ante game and discuss some of the prob
lems that will face the whole country this com
ing November.
On to the Political Union Nominating Con
vention, tonight. G. H.
