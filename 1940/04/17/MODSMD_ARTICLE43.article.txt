## THE 						BIG ISSUE 
### 
'THE EDITOR, SIR:
While I suppose you have had a lot of fun print
ing the letters regarding "House Mothers' and while I
admit they have been amusing, I think that you are
"fiddling while Rome bums." What I mean is, why
waste a lot of time about House Mothers when there
may not be a Stanford as we know it a few years
hence.
If the tuition rates are raised as is rumored, a lot of
the best men at Stanford will be unable to stay on.
Moreover, a lot of other deserving men who do not
have rich parents will be unable to enter. Then what?
Stanford will be a college for the sons of rich men.
Are you going to do nothing about this issue? Get
off the House Mother subject, which is only froth on
the surafce, and get going on something of vital im
portance to the University. Get Stanford students to
express their thoughts on this subject, as if you do
not we may have higher fees to stomach and no means
to do it with. If we do not make our side heard can
we blame the University and the Trustees if they as
sume that we are able to take the added load. Now
is the time to have our say and not afterwards when
action has been taken.
Stanford is in a tough spot. Dean Jackson told us
that recently and Mr. Hoover hinted at it too. All
tucker touched upon it in his talk last Thursday and
the time is ripe. We can not be expected to know all
about the University but we should let it be known
to the President and the Trustees that we are worried
about the raise and that if it goes through many of us
will be unable to pay the bill. This thing is going to
hit Stanford right between the eyes and I urge you to
start the ball going in The Daily.
How about a petition to the Trustees? How about
asking what the increase will be? How about asking
why the raise is necessary? Can the University cut
down on some things not essential instead of raising
rates?
Very truly yours,
A Friend
