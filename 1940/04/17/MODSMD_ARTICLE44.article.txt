STANFORD-BINET I.Q.'S
YORK CITY.—Off the crowded, noisy streets
of the slum district there is a New York public
school. Inside the children, whose families are on
relief, are eating a free meal, and the teacher is having
a little trouble with one of New York's "problem
children."
We ask the teacher if we may look around, and she
calls two of her smart pupils to take us to the Prin
cipal s office. Steve has the physique of a six-year-old
child, but he is nine years old in appearance. Steve is
blond, with quick light eyes, and Louie is dark-haired
with a sensitive, alert expression on his face.
Both of the children are clothed poorly, but they
are neat and courteous. "What are you going to do
when you grow up, Louie?' we ask.
His face lights up; he is anxious to tell us all about
his plans and poorly-grounded dreams. "I'm gonna be
a wonderful aviator," Louie answers.
Steve is a little more sober and a little more accu
rate. "I don't know what I'm gonna do," he says.
"I'm just leamin'."
We arrive at the Principal's office, and offer Steve
and Louie a dime for ice cream cones. The boys don't
get many ice cream cones, but they are proud and
dignified, even with their East-side accents. "No,"
says Steve, "we didn't do anythin'. We can't take that.
Thanks."
And Steve and Louie return our smiles and walk
back to class.

Principal of the school is an intelligent, educated
man who is well aware of the tremendous prob
lems he has to face; he is interested in his work. Most
of the children are "retarded" in their studies, he tells
us. But there are a few bright ones. Sixty per cent
are average; 30 per cent are below average, and 10 per
cent are superior students.
"What about the superior students," we ask the
Principal. "Do you ever give thern I.Q. tests?"
"Yes," the principal answers gravely. 'Some of them
have I.Q.'s of one hundred and forty or forty-five.
Sometimes their sisters and brothers are subnormal.
But once in a while we may have three or four bril
liant children in one family. Very few of them get to
college, though. They have to work."
The next time someone tells me that "genius will
out I will strain to be polite. I will wonder how much
of an opportunity Steve and Louie will get—outside of
a chance to make a high score on the Stanford-Binet
Revision Test.
