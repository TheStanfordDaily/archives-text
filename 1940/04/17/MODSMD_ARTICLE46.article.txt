# YO, MYSELF, NO HABLO EL ESPANOL
## 
### 
A guy from Yale has written a book about his
travels around the world, and he includes in a chap
ter the time he talked to a Spanish instructor from
Stanford.
"Wo talked away there for quite a while," he says.
"Finally I asked him where he was from. He was from
Stanford. And here all the time we had both thought
the other was a Spaniard."
Yes, that's all right about two Americas convincing
each other that they were Spaniards.
But could they have fooled a Spaniard?
