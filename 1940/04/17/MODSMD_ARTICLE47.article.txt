# ODE TO ODOROUS

When I hear my friends all say:
"Here it is, almost May,
The month you really should be sharp,
Going into the woods, lying on a tarp,
Look at you."
"You have more hair on your head
Than there's horse-hair in a mammoth bed
Why don't you get a season ticket
To a barber shop, or become a picket.
Look at you."
"We've made a sound analysis.
It comes to this:
Your ears must be snipped,
Or your hair clipped.
Look at you."
There s only one thing I myself can say:
I m sick of hearing you groan this way.
If you can t stop that bloody furor,
Get thee into a size eight mirror
And look at you.
