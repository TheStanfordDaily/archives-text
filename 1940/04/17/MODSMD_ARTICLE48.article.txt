# Dance Recital Shows Talent, Good Planning
## 
### 
The normal calm of the Tuesday
Series was pleasantly jolted last
night when Orchesis, Stanford's
modem dance group, took over the
proceedings to present a vital and
colorful program in its own par
ticular.
Proving itself worthy of an im
portant place among the Farm's older
activities, the three-year-old organi
zation, under the direction of Mar
garet Jewell, presented an entertain
ing and intelligently planned recital,
designed to show the fullest capa
bilities of the group—and those ca
pabilities are not to be dismissed
lightly.
First on the program was a demon
stration of the various dance move
ments done by the full group. Using
sections or individuals moving now
in contrast, now in unison, the dem
onstration became more than a series
of movements; it seemed to express
sheer pleasure in easy execution of
difficult physical feats.
DANCERS LAUGH AT SELVES
"So What," which followed, poked
hilarious fun at the demonstration,
clearly illustrating what can happen
to even a good dancer, if she has no
intellectual or emotional drive be
hind her dance.
"Danger—Girls at Work," a nutty
satire on the Hoover War Libe;
"Dancer's Dream," in which every
threadbare piece of dance music was
woven into the nonsense of a dream;
and "Polka," a piece in the "ro
mantic" mood gone overboard,
rounded out the uniformly excellent
lighter section.
"Alarm" expressing the moods of
repose and sudden flight, was done
without accompaniment, and seemed
to me weak in comparison with the
other serious efforts. However, the
vignette on propaganda, '"The Peo
ple Speak," gave a vivid impression
of the insidious workings of this
modern problem.
SARABANDE EXCELLENT
In a mood of complete coldness,
showing the near-cruel formality of
the Spanish Renaissance court, "Sa
rabande" was vaguely reminiscent
of the Joos Ballet's "Pavane for a
Dead Infanta," though abstract.
The two solos, "Prelude to Con
quest" and "Broken Lullaby," were
each superb in their kind, though the
haunting emotion of the lattter gave
it more human appeal. Completely
abstract were the delightful "Twelve-
Beat Invention" and the vigorous
"Trio," while "Primitive Mode" with
its wild drum rhythm and garish,
savage movement was by far the
most spectacular of the dances.
Lighting and costuming were com
pletely satisfactory; and pianist Jo
sephine Haskell deserves special or
chids all for herself. The whole
recital was Miss Jewell's orchid.—

DANCERS LAUGH AT SELVES
"So What," which followed, poked
hilarious fun at the demonstration,
clearly illustrating what can happen
to even a good dancer, if she has no
intellectual or emotional drive be
hind her dance.
"Danger—Girls at Work," a nutty
satire on the Hoover War Libe;
"Dancer's Dream," in which every
threadbare piece of dance music was
woven into the nonsense of a dream;
and "Polka," a piece in the "ro
mantic" mood gone overboard,
rounded out the uniformly excellent
lighter section.
"Alarm" expressing the moods of
repose and sudden flight, was done
without accompaniment, and seemed
to me weak in comparison with the
other serious efforts. However, the
vignette on propaganda, '"The Peo
ple Speak," gave a vivid impression
of the insidious workings of this
modern problem.
SARABANDE EXCELLENT
In a mood of complete coldness,
showing the near-cruel formality of
the Spanish Renaissance court, "Sa
rabande" was vaguely reminiscent
of the Joos Ballet's "Pavane for a
Dead Infanta," though abstract.
The two solos, "Prelude to Con
quest" and "Broken Lullaby," were
each superb in their kind, though the
haunting emotion of the lattter gave
it more human appeal. Completely
abstract were the delightful "Twelve-
Beat Invention" and the vigorous
"Trio," while "Primitive Mode" with
its wild drum rhythm and garish,
savage movement was by far the
most spectacular of the dances.
Lighting and costuming were com
pletely satisfactory; and pianist Jo
sephine Haskell deserves special or
chids all for herself. The whole
recital was Miss Jewell's orchid.—

The normal calm of the Tuesday
Series was pleasantly jolted last
night when Orchesis, Stanford's
modem dance group, took over the
proceedings to present a vital and
colorful program in its own par
ticular.
Proving itself worthy of an im
portant place among the Farm's older
activities, the three-year-old organi
zation, under the direction of Mar
garet Jewell, presented an entertain
ing and intelligently planned recital,
designed to show the fullest capa
bilities of the group—and those ca
pabilities are not to be dismissed
lightly.
First on the program was a demon
stration of the various dance move
ments done by the full group. Using
sections or individuals moving now
in contrast, now in unison, the dem
onstration became more than a series
of movements; it seemed to express
sheer pleasure in easy execution of
difficult physical feats.
