### WILSON CANNON 
J J ERR HITLER seems ready to
make his biggest gamble.
Master of the international dice
cubes, Der Fuehrer is covering all
floor bets in his latest game of
chance. And the maestro of the
Reich rarely guesses wrong.
Hitler is betting that the British
Navy can be defeated by German
air strength. And, while he has not
set the hour or time of the trial,
international bookies are saying that
it will be soon.
Stakes arc tremendous. For
when the German leader chooses
to cast the ivories, victory or de
feat for the Reich in World War II
will ride with them.
Once the chips are on the table,
the two greatest powers in the world
will be face to face.
On one side of the table will be
the British Navy. Queen of the seas
almost since time immemorial. The
most powerful fleet in the history of
the British empire. And the fleet
upon which that empire must ride
or sink.
Opposing this battlewagon power
house is the airfleet of the German
Reich. Not the largest air armada in
the world has Adolf Hitler, nor the
newest. But he does control the
most efficient and most concentrated
air power now engaged in World
War 11.
Detonations from such a colli
sion would be greater than those
which followed Krakatoa. Almost
every corner of the world would be
afTected in some way.

SHOULD the British fleet fall it
would doubtless herald the crash of
the English Empire from its seat in
the international sun. For without
her navy the ocean-bound kingdom
could not protect her supply lines.
And without a constant stream of
imports, the British Isles could not
live.
But the stakes the Reich stands to
lose are just as great. Should the
English cripple the German air fleet
the end would be close for this dream
of a German world-wide empire. A
grounded Germany would have
about as much effect as a water
pistol in a rain storm. There just
wouldn't be anything there.
Cagey Hitler will make no move
until he is ready. And he is the
man who must call the play. The
Reich airfleet can tangle with Lon
don any time they wish. Unfor
tunately, for the English, their sea
fleet is watcrbound.
What makes the international ex
perts think the time of the trial is
near is the groundwork now being
laid by the Hitler war machine.
Hitler almost threw away his navy
during his last-week rush into
Scandinavian Norway. He sacrificed
the finest of his warships to gain this
objective. But he knew what he was
doing.
Â»}t
NORWAY, and from Den
mark, the German airfleet can
flank the British Isles from the skies.
The bomber can sacrifice tons of
gasoline for tons of explosives . . .
the mileage saved is that important.
Unless international opinion has
erred, the British fleet will soon send
naval replacements to the North
Sea. For it was fleet commitments
in the Mediterranean and the Near
East that enabled Hitler's successes
on the northern front. And it may
be replacements in the North Sea
which will stop further attack by
the Reich.
Perhaps the most vital reason
for a shifting of British naval
power to the north is the case of
little Belgium. Statisticians on
both sides know the strategic
worth of this nation. British re
ports hint that Ilitler is headed
there next.
Concentration in the North Sea
may cause Hitler to reconsider any
plans concerning Belgium. The
British cannot afford German occu
pation of this nation. For her stra
tegic position is such that it could
command both the Maginot line and
air lanes to London.

The forest service estimates 630,-
000,000 acres of timber land is suf
ficient to meet the country's needs.
