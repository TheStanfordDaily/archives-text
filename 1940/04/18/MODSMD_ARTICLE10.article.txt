SWEDISH-NORWEGIAN FRON
TIER, April 17 (UP). —Swedish sol
diers worked furiously at various
points along this frontier today lay
ing barbed wire entanglements and
digging machine gun emplacements
as precautions against a possible
blitzkrieg attack.
The atmosphere in Sweden is
tense. When the Finnish war ended
the Swedes resumed their old calm,
believing the dangers to their se
curity had passed. Today Sweden is
concentrating all her efforts toward
maintaining a position which can
best be described as "armed neu
trality."
All preventative measures such as
building air raid shelters, distribu
tion of gas masks, partial evacua
tions, blackouts and the mining of
Swedish territorial waters were
taken.
The general tone of Swedish news
papers indicates there is no cause
yet for outright pessimism. Political
quarters point out that any attempts
to invade Sweden would require too
many troops, which the European
belligerents cannot .spare from other
fronts.
There is no sign that Sweden is
supplying materials of any kind to
the Norwegians. Unofficial sources
said this is due to a "secret ultima
tum" from the Germans in view of
the great amount of help Sweden
sent Finland.
