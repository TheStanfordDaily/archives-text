# New President Makes Initial Statement
## 
### 
I wish to take this opportunity
to express my appreciation for the
support I received in the recent
election.
In my opinion it is unwise at
this time to attempt to lay out any
detailed program for next year, but
I hope in the interval before tak
ing office to fully acquaint myself
with the technical aspects of the
position so as to be prepared to
meet the problems of student
government as they arise next se
mester.
I am sure I speak for all the
newly elected officers in saying
that we feel deeply honored at
being elected, that we fully rec
ognize the responsibilities that we
will have, and that we will ear
nestly strive by our actions to
merit the confidence that has been
placed in us.
