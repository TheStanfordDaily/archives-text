# GLENN MILLER TOPS IN POLL
## Goodman Takes Second; Farm Likes 'Sweet' 
### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
Goodman has 'em all beat!
Aw, he doesn't hold a leather to Count
Basie.
But Glenn Miller can outblow any of them.
And so the controversy rages, around juke
boxes, in bull sessions, or wherever students
gather. Each jive lover or sweet advocate has
his own favorite, but the largest single group
on campus agrees on one thing:
Glenn Miller is the king.
Asked "Which is your favorite big name
band?" 28 per cent of Stanford students gues
tioned named Glenn Miller, who topped Benny
Goodman, with 10 per cent, by almost triple the
votes. Orrin Tucker and Tommy Dorsey are
tied for third place with 9 per cent, closely
followed by Guy Lombardo with 8 per cent.
Tied as fifth place favorites are Kay Kayser and
Ray Noble, 7 per cent; then, Freddy Martin, 4
per cent; Eddie Duchin, 3 per cent; Count Basie,
2 per cent; Sammy Kaye, Artie Shaw, Larry
Clinton, Andre Kostelanetz —all with 1 per cent.
Nine per cent "like them all; no particular
choice."
As part of this opinion survey conducted by
The Stanford Daily, a second guestion was
asked: "Do you like 'hot' bands better than j
I sweet' bands?"—with the following results:
NO 59%
YES 32%
Undecided 9%
Campus women protested against the hot
bands much more emphatically than did the ]
, men, who were closely divided on the guestion
of "hot better than sweet," as is seen by the
! following:
No Yes Und.
Women 70% 13% 17%
Men 54% 40% 6%
Of all the guestions asked so far in The Stan
ford Daily survey, the "favorite band" question
has raised the greatest disagreement among tne
cross-section interviewed. A large number of
the sample were emphatic in praise of their
favorite and disparaging toward the other top
rankino bands.

"What a silly question; Benny heps like
no one can possibly hep!" "Ye gads, not
Tucker—never." "Who said Lombardo has
a band?" "Please don't even try to compare
T. Dorsey's swing with all that other wishy
washy stuff."

Some unanimity of opinion was revealed in
the comments on Duke Ellington. The cross
section indicated Ellington is an institution in
American music, not a fad as are the time-to-time
favorites. And in answer to the charge that
Ellington is only a "hot" band, one student re
marked, "If the Duke can't play everything, in
cluding the best of 'sweet,' what do you call
his best numbers, 'Sophisticated Lady,' 'Mood
Indigo,' and 'In My Solitude'?"

Goodman has 'em all beat!

Of all the guestions asked so far in The Stan
ford Daily survey, the "favorite band" question
has raised the greatest disagreement among tne
cross-section interviewed. A large number of
the sample were emphatic in praise of their
favorite and disparaging toward the other top
rankino bands.

"What a silly question; Benny heps like
no one can possibly hep!" "Ye gads, not
Tucker—never." "Who said Lombardo has
a band?" "Please don't even try to compare
T. Dorsey's swing with all that other wishy
washy stuff."

Some unanimity of opinion was revealed in
the comments on Duke Ellington. The cross
section indicated Ellington is an institution in
American music, not a fad as are the time-to-time
favorites. And in answer to the charge that
Ellington is only a "hot" band, one student re
marked, "If the Duke can't play everything, in
cluding the best of 'sweet,' what do you call
his best numbers, 'Sophisticated Lady,' 'Mood
Indigo,' and 'In My Solitude'?"

Goodman has 'em all beat!
Aw, he doesn't hold a leather to Count
Basie.
But Glenn Miller can outblow any of them.
And so the controversy rages, around juke
boxes, in bull sessions, or wherever students
gather. Each jive lover or sweet advocate has
his own favorite, but the largest single group
on campus agrees on one thing:
Glenn Miller is the king.
Asked "Which is your favorite big name
band?" 28 per cent of Stanford students gues
tioned named Glenn Miller, who topped Benny
Goodman, with 10 per cent, by almost triple the
votes. Orrin Tucker and Tommy Dorsey are
tied for third place with 9 per cent, closely
followed by Guy Lombardo with 8 per cent.
Tied as fifth place favorites are Kay Kayser and
Ray Noble, 7 per cent; then, Freddy Martin, 4
per cent; Eddie Duchin, 3 per cent; Count Basie,
2 per cent; Sammy Kaye, Artie Shaw, Larry
Clinton, Andre Kostelanetz —all with 1 per cent.
Nine per cent "like them all; no particular
choice."
As part of this opinion survey conducted by
The Stanford Daily, a second guestion was
asked: "Do you like 'hot' bands better than j
I sweet' bands?"—with the following results:
NO 59%
YES 32%
Undecided 9%
Campus women protested against the hot
bands much more emphatically than did the ]
, men, who were closely divided on the guestion
of "hot better than sweet," as is seen by the
! following:
No Yes Und.
