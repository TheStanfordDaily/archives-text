# Hoover Library To Be Finished Late This Year
## Building to Include Individual Cubicles For Student Work 
### VIC MINAHAN 
The Hoover Library on War,
Revolution, and Peace will not be
ready for dedication until at least
December, 1940, according to an es
timate made yesterday by Super
intendent John Leavers.
Most of the work now being done
on Ihe structure is the construction
of the concrete walls and floors.
Pouring of the tenth floor will begin
today, but because of the complica
tions incurred in the pouring of the
less uniform higher walls and floors,
the cement work will not be com
pleted until Ihe middle of July.
FEATURES STUDY ROOMS
One of the main features of the
building will be a number of small
cubicles especially suited to indi
vidual study. The entire second
floor and much of the tenth floor
will be made up of these.
The rumor on campus that the
cubicle-like room at the tip of the
structure was intended for an of
fice for ex-President Herbert Hoo
ver or Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur was
denied by Mr. Leavers, who explain
ed that offices for both these men
have been provided on the eleventh
floor. This floor will also contain the
offices of Professors Harold H. Fisher
and Ralph H. Lutz and their secre
taries.
SIX STACK FLOORS
The floors between the third and
the ninth will be the stack floors,
and will contain most of the library's
documents. Only the first three of
these will be outfitted for immediate
use, however.
The first floor will contain the of
fices of the librarian, the reference
librarian, Dr. Wilbur's custodian,
several secretaries and typists, and
a Maps and Prints Room. Also on
the plans for this floor is a Radio
Room, the exact use of which was
not divulged by Mr. Leavers.
BASEMENT STORAGE SPACE
Approximately half of the base
ment, will be used as storage space
for a large collection of newspapers
published during and after the last
war and which contain much import
ant data. Space for more newspapers
which will be collected during the
present and possible future wars
will be left in the west portion of
the basement.
The building will be steam-heated,
and floors without windows to the
outside, which include most of the
stack floors, will be air-conditioned.

The rumor on campus that the
cubicle-like room at the tip of the
structure was intended for an of
fice for ex-President Herbert Hoo
ver or Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur was
denied by Mr. Leavers, who explain
ed that offices for both these men
have been provided on the eleventh
floor. This floor will also contain the
offices of Professors Harold H. Fisher
and Ralph H. Lutz and their secre
taries.
SIX STACK FLOORS
The floors between the third and
the ninth will be the stack floors,
and will contain most of the library's
documents. Only the first three of
these will be outfitted for immediate
use, however.
The first floor will contain the of
fices of the librarian, the reference
librarian, Dr. Wilbur's custodian,
several secretaries and typists, and
a Maps and Prints Room. Also on
the plans for this floor is a Radio
Room, the exact use of which was
not divulged by Mr. Leavers.
BASEMENT STORAGE SPACE
Approximately half of the base
ment, will be used as storage space
for a large collection of newspapers
published during and after the last
war and which contain much import
ant data. Space for more newspapers
which will be collected during the
present and possible future wars
will be left in the west portion of
the basement.
The building will be steam-heated,
and floors without windows to the
outside, which include most of the
stack floors, will be air-conditioned.
The Hoover Library on War,
Revolution, and Peace will not be
ready for dedication until at least
December, 1940, according to an es
timate made yesterday by Super
intendent John Leavers.
Most of the work now being done
on Ihe structure is the construction
of the concrete walls and floors.
Pouring of the tenth floor will begin
today, but because of the complica
tions incurred in the pouring of the
less uniform higher walls and floors,
the cement work will not be com
pleted until Ihe middle of July.
FEATURES STUDY ROOMS
One of the main features of the
building will be a number of small
cubicles especially suited to indi
vidual study. The entire second
floor and much of the tenth floor
will be made up of these.
