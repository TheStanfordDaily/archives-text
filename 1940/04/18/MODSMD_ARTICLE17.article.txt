# Stanford Political Union Nominates Cordell Hull; G.O.P. Takes Back Seat
## Forum Hears Livingston Swing Vote As Farm Indicates 'Straws in Wind' For 1940 National Political Battle 
### 
Bases for Stanford's reputation as a rock-ribbed Republican stronghold
were weakened at last nigbt's Political Union meeting, where the final
balloting was between two Democrats, Roosevelt and Hull. Mr. Hull, in
whose behalf Larry Livingston, former Daily editor, spoke, finally received
the nomination by «» 41 to 22 vote.

, The two Republicans who .sur
vived tht; preliminaries were Bob
Tuft, characterized by his sponsor,
Walt Stoessel, as "comfortable and
safe as a pair of old carpet slip
pers," and Thomas Dewey, whose
qualifications were adequately prc*-
sented by Anne Killefer.
In the second to last ballot the
votes tallied as follows: Hull led
with 25; Roosevelt held the also-ran
spot with 17; and Taft and Dewey
trailed with 13 and 10, respectively.
REPUBLICANS SLIPPING
Livingston advanced as his first
premise the theory that the Repub
lican party would not win another
election as long as it represented a
minority of (he electorate, that is,
the upper middle class and big busi
ness. He cited Hull as potential
Democratic nominee rather than
Roosevelt because of (1) the strength
of the two-term tradition; (2) Roo
sevelt's weakened physical condition,
substantiated by his wife's recent
comment that "he's extremely tired."
FOREIGN RELATIONS
Hull's familiarity \vith the inter
national situation was advanced as
a point in his favor in view of the
fact that, in Livingston's opinion,
the next U. S. President will be
having close dealings with the Euro
pean war dogs.
In reviewing the other possible
Democratic nominees, Livingston
had occasion to refer to Paul V. Mc-
Nutt as having one principal advan
tage. "He's a Beta, you know," the
speaker said, nodding at Bruce Jcs
sup, A.S.S.U. president-elect and a
Beta, "and they are very strong in
politics."
Pete Whittlesey, Interfraternity
Council proxy, spoke effectively for
Jim Farley; Bill Turner, enthusiastic
Delt, gave his verbal nod to Roose
velt, and Mollie West stumped for
Paul V. McNult. Proposed from the
floor and eliminated in the first bal
lot along with Farley and McNutt
were Herbert Hoover and Burton K.
Wheeler, senator from Montana.
