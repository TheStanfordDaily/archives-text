### 
LULEA, Sweden, Thursday, April IK (UP). —A hitler battle between
British-Norwegian and German forces for the entire Narvik region in
northern Norway is raging north of Herjangs Fjord, reliable information

BRITISH GAIN FOOTIIOLI)
Other British troops are along the
South side of Ofoten Fjord, which
leads into Narvik harbor. They re
portedly have gained a foothold in
the village of Ankenes, which is on
the west side of Narvik Bay.
The Germans inside Narvik still
hold the town, however, according to
the latest reports reaching here.
Earlier the Germans in the town had
been reported in imminent danger
of being driven out.
The British plan apparently is to
try to regain Romback heights, which
were given up by the Norwegians,
and attempt to cut off the German
retreat to Sweden before beginning
final assault on the town. The Brit
ish would try to trap the Germans
in the fjord valley.
