## Appropriation Gives Third Pair of Locks For Panama Defense 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 17 (UP).—
The Senate today passed the $223,-
000,000 War Department-Civil Func
tions Appropriation Bill, increased
nearly $20,000,000 above House-ap
proved figures and carrying $15,000 -
000 for a start of a third set of locks
at the Panama Canal.
The canal funds had been elimi
nated by the House on recommenda
tion of its Appropriation Committee
which contended the project was be
ing pushed too rapidly. This ired
President Roosevelt, who warned
that the locks are indispensable to
ihe national defense.
INCREASE KILLED
Pa-sagf* came by a voice vote after
• conomy forces beat down efforts to
increase funds for flood control
work from $70,000,000 to $100,000,000.
The bill now goes to conference.
Sei.. Alva B. Adams, D., Colo., a
leading economy advocate, sought to
block the canal appropriation on the
grounds that Congress was being
stampeded into huge expenditures
by "imaginary dangers of imminent
war." The $15,000,000 had been in
cluded in Mr. Roosevelt's "bedrock"
J 941 budget.
Sen. Robert A. Taft, R, 0., de
nounced the proposed increase in
flood control funds, terming it a
"pork barrel" proposition. The in
crease was approved by the Appro
priations Sub-committee in charge
of the bill but was rejected by the
full committee.
FLOOD CONTROL
In addition to the $70,000,000 for
general flood control work, the bill
now provides $30,000,000 for Missis
sippi River flood control projects,
$24,300,000 for rivers and harbors
work, $2,000,000 for construction of a
hydroelectric plant at Fort Peck
Dam, Mont., and $3,400,000 for a
similar plant at Bonneville Dam,
Ore.
A total of $44,248,771 is provided
'or the Panama Canal, exclusive of
the money to start work on the new
bomb-proof locks which eventually
will cost $277,000,000.
