# Sholem Asch's 'Nazarene' Shows Reverence, Polish
## 
### 
"THE NAZARENE." by Sholem Asch. On sale at the Stanford Book
store.
Though this book is about the last years in the life of Christ, it is far
more than a reverent narrative. Written by a Polish Jew, it is a superbly
scholarly work written with authority and polish.

♦ Asch tells his story from the
viewpoints of three men, all of
whom had dealings with Jesus. The
first of these is Cornelius, the Rom
an officer in command of the An
tonia Fortress in Jerusalem and sec
ond to Pilate as representative of
the Empire in Palestine.
Second comes the story of Judah
Ish Kariot (Judas) as told by him
self. This manuscript (Asch, of
I course, is the author, but the piece
| is completely convincing) ends just
before Christ makes his entry into
Jerusalem on Palm Sunday.
i Then the story is taken up by
Joachim, pupil of the Rabbi Nicco
demon, who watches the events of
that swift week with sympathetic
eyes, though neither he nor his
rabbi is converted to the New Faith.
Asch integrated his narrative with
a device which is nearly as fasci
nating as the story itself. He him
j self takes the part of a student of
| Hebrew from a Polish ghetto, called
| in to aid an ancient scholar who
hates Jews. The old man is half
mad and ho has spells during which
he thinks he is Cornelius, the Hege
| mon of Jerusalem.
The young Jew records the old
man's ravings and translated the
manuscript of Judas. Then, he him
self becomes so steeped in the an
j cient stories that for a time he be
comes Joachim. Asch tells this
i strange tale simply and directly, with
no excuses or psychological expla
nations.
The result is that in the book, you
actually feel the shimmering heat
| of Palestine; you move among the
teeming, colorful crowds of Jerusa
lem; and you smell the garlicy.
sweating humanity of ihe city. But
more than that, Asch puts you in
side the Jewish mind and forces you
to feel their emotions.
Each minor character is carefully
drawn: the 'Magdalene, whom he
calls Miriam of Migdai; Simon, the
fisherman; the effete, worldly sons
of the House of Hanan; John the
Baptist; Herod Antipater and his
wife Herodias; Salome, who, it turns
out, could not have been more than
nine years old when she performed
her famous dance; the wise old
Rabbi Niccodemon, who fights for
a fair trial for Christ, though he
does not embrace his teachings.*
Christ, himself, is portrayed with
an incredible beauty and reverent
understanding. Most of the early
story of Christ is told through the
eyes of Judas, and the motivation
for Judas' betrayal is completely
logical, and also understandable.
For two resaons, the book should
