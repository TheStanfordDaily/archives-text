### 
The first 50 people at the A.S.S.U.

50 who'll hear Duke Elling
ton at Friday night's Junior Prom.
This was the announcement re
leased last night by Greyson Bryan
and his dance committeemen. The
original quota of 450 bids was ex
hausted yesterday, Bryan indicated.
In response to repeated demand, an
additional fifty ducats are being
printed.
' There will be absolutely no more
than fifty tickets offered for sale.
Demand has far exceeded our ex
pectation, but we feel that those who
have already purchased bids should
not be subjected to the inconveni
ence of a crowded dance floor.
That's why the sale will be
strictly limited," Bryan stated.
If the tickets are sold today and
tomorrow morning, none will be
available at the door on Friday
night, Bob Anderson reiterated. He
further urged all prospective Prom
goers to purchase tickets today.
The Duke will play for dancing
from 9 to 1 o'clock in the Pavilion.
Dress will be semi-formal, and Bob
Newell and his committeemen will
begin the process of decorating the
scene of the "black and white Prom"
this afternoon.
