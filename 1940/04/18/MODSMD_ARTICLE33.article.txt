### FRANK GUTHRIE 
I was talking things (that means
everything from track to soccer) !
over with Harry Maloney the other i
clay. As this likeable Irishman likes
to do and of which he is the best j
authority, Harry started rcminisc- |
ing in the dim Stanford athletic i
past.
However, what he had to say
and till about didn't bring about
much of an impression until we
went next door into the trophy
room, where we could see the bun- I
dreds of silver and bronze tro- }
pit ics and framed pictures that
represent Stanford athletic his
tory—the Farm's achievements
from 1X92 to the present.
* H> *
WHAT I SAW I dare say very
few persons on the Farm today have I
ever taken time out to see. That '
isn't their fault, because, you see, [
the so-called trophy room is locked
the better part of the day. That is
because the B.A.C. hasn't anyone to :
take care of the room and keep a
watch out that nothing is taken.
* * *
THE TROPHY ROOM is some- |
thing which should interest the
alumni of Stanford and recall to
them the memories of such things
as the three ties and a victory by
Stanford over California in 1892, '93,
'94 and '95, or the greatest of all |
Big Games, the 20-20 deadlock in I
'24.
The student's interest is just
shallow unless he sees a trophy |
and vaguely remembers that he j
heard about that famous team or
player. Thus he connects the
award with the past.
« :,H *
WHEN TIIE ALUMNI come back j
to look over the place, the chances !
are 100-1 that he won't get a look
at his or his pal's athletic achieve
ments. That is merely because the '
trophy room in Encina gym is not
ideally situated. It seems to have
become more like a storehouse for a
lot of valuable antiques which no |
one wants to show his friends.
Then when it came time to make j
that annual Stanford Fund drive it
might not be so hard to get them
to contribute.
* * *
WHAT SLANTS SUGGESTS, and
what most everyone over at the j
B.A.C. would like to see in the in- j
terest of Stanford, would be for the
University to find some prominent
place on the Quad which could be j
used as an appropriate Trophy j
Room.
We suggest Oat before any defi
nite plans have been made in the
new Hoover Library that a room
be allocated for the purpose of
housing our athletic trophies.
If that wouldn't work, then why !
couldn't the present Hoover iTibe site !
in the Main Libe be used for a ;
Trophy Room? It's something to j
look into.
* * *
A CUSTODIAN OF TROPHIES
would also be in order, that person
to be some prominent athlete who j
would be elected for a year. At the
present time, the trophies haven't !
been too well taken care of, they \
aren't all in the trophy room, and ;
they haven't been kept up to date, j
So if this trophy room project
goes through, in the near future
lhc.se four men who set a new
world mile relay standard of 3:10.5
last Saturday, Clyde Jeffrey. Char- !
lie Shaw, Craig Williamson, and
Ernie Clark, will be coming back
to see their red and white baton
in a sacred place.
