# Coast Mermen To Clash Here
## 
### 
With one of the greatest 50-yard
freestyle fields ever gathered at a
single meet, and a battle royal for
second place behind the mighty Tro
jans, the southern division Confer
ence swimming championships here
Saturday should again prove the
blue ribbon event of western aquatic
competition.
This amazing bunch of sprinters
is headed by U.S.C.'s Paul Wolf and
Bobby Sellers, two of the country's
outstanding men in the short dash
and includes six men who have
beaten 24 seconds. Never before has
the meet been won in less than 24
flat.
Bill Kuehne of U.C.L.A., Marty
Lloyd and Steve Aranson of Cal, and
Stanford's Co-captain Roy Vitousek
will battle the two Trojan stars in
what should be a headache for the
judges at the finish.
In the 200-yard breaststroke, Vi
tousek will attempt to wrest the
title from Dick Whitney of S. C. in
revenge for his defeat at the con
ference meet last year. Vitousek
beat Whitney handily in the Stan
ford-S.C. dual clash last year, only
to lose in the closing yards of the
conference championships. The con
ference record of 2:30 flat may top
ple.
The 400-yard freestyle relay, final
event of the afternoon, should be a
great race between S.C., Cal, and the
Bruins with each school having its
best team in many a year. The In
dians are weak in this event and
don't figure to drag down any
points.
