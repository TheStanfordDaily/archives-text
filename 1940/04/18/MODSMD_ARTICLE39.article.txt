# Card Gridders Continue Drills
## 
### 
Behind locked doors on the prac
tice field yesterday Coach Clark
Shaughnessy sent His Indian grid
ders through secret practice. There
was nothing in the drill, however,
that possible scouts could not see in
any of the open spring practice ses
sions.
Following the same routine used
in every drill so far, the gridders
started with a period of calisthenics,
then divided the remaining time be
tween practicing fundamentals and
running through plays.
The squad will have a day of rest
this afternoon, with a chalk talk
scheduled. Friday another secret
workout will be held, with only the
press admitted.
