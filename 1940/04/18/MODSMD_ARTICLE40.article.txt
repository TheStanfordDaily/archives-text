# Hopes Run High For Net Victory
## 
### 
Hopes for a Card tennis victory
over California are running high
out around the tennis courts. Al
though the tennis men were turned
back 5-4 in their first match, most
observers feel that with a few
"come through" performances the
Cards can reverse the decision.
All this week the Card netmen
have been working out in the hot
sun and are almost in perfect shape.
Larry Dee, the number one man for
the Cards, worked on his serve and
ovei'head for almost two hours yes
terday and will continue his work
outs for the remainder of the week.
Meanwhile the Card frosh are
also working out for their coming
struggle with the Cal frosh Satur
day morning. The Bear Cubs have
several outstanding stars on this
year's team, including George Spen
cer and Tom Brown, leading junior
star from San Francisco.
