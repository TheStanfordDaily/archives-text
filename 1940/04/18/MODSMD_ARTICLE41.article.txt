# Moore Takes Record
## Three-quarter Mark Cut To 2:58.7 as Cards Down San Jose Staters 110-21 
### 
Smashing all existing records fur three-quarters of a mile, Paul Moore
yesterday matched strides with Mushy Girard for three laps and finished
going awav in 2:58.7. the best time ever hung up for the odd distance.
liili Ellington, who makes a habit of forecasting records for his run
ners, freely predicted that Paul would better the world mark; but he

never told anyone that Girard
come in for a share of the glory. And
that's just what Mush did when he j
finished four or five yards behind
his teammate in 3:00.1.
Yesterday's amazing performance
by Stanford distance stars wiped out
the previous mark, Jules Ladoume- j
gue's accepted world record of 3:00.6.
FAST FIRST LAP
Getting oft to a good start, P.iul
moved out in front and was clocked
in 58 sec. {or the first lap, a step :
ahead of Girard, who took over the i
pace for the next 600 yards, leading
Paul through a 61 sec. second lap.
Running smoothly with little evi
dence of his old bobbing, bouncing
stride, Paul showed no sign ol tie
ing up as he passed Mushy at the
end of the back-stretch and came
off the far turn a couple of strides
in front.
He finished with plenty of kick as
Girard slowed down and a shout
from the head timer indicated that
the record had been smashed. A
slight breeze was blowing at the
time of the race, but does not influ
ence any race over a 660.
FOURTH RECORD
It was the fourth great accom
plishment of Ellington's boys this
season. First Clyde Jeffrey, Farm
captain, equalled the record for the
hundred with a 9.4 performance at
the Long Beach Relays. Then the
Cardinal two-mile relay team set a
new intercollegiate mark and the
mile relay quartet shattered the
world rcord by more than a second.
And what's more. Ellington tells ev
j erybody that these things are going
j to happen beforehand.
I By way of background for this
world record assault yesterday af
j ternoon, San Jose State and Stan
: ford staged a better-than-average
j dual meet with the Indians crush

.Into 91 J
Smashing all existing records fur three-quarters of a mile, Paul Moore
yesterday matched strides with Mushy Girard for three laps and finished
going awav in 2:58.7. the best time ever hung up for the odd distance.
liili Ellington, who makes a habit of forecasting records for his run
ners, freely predicted that Paul would better the world mark; but he

never told anyone that Girard
come in for a share of the glory. And
that's just what Mush did when he j
finished four or five yards behind
his teammate in 3:00.1.
Yesterday's amazing performance
by Stanford distance stars wiped out
the previous mark, Jules Ladoume- j
gue's accepted world record of 3:00.6.
FAST FIRST LAP
Getting oft to a good start, P.iul
moved out in front and was clocked
in 58 sec. {or the first lap, a step :
ahead of Girard, who took over the i
pace for the next 600 yards, leading
Paul through a 61 sec. second lap.
Running smoothly with little evi
dence of his old bobbing, bouncing
stride, Paul showed no sign ol tie
ing up as he passed Mushy at the
end of the back-stretch and came
off the far turn a couple of strides
in front.
He finished with plenty of kick as
Girard slowed down and a shout
from the head timer indicated that
the record had been smashed. A
slight breeze was blowing at the
time of the race, but does not influ
ence any race over a 660.
FOURTH RECORD
It was the fourth great accom
plishment of Ellington's boys this
season. First Clyde Jeffrey, Farm
captain, equalled the record for the
hundred with a 9.4 performance at
the Long Beach Relays. Then the
Cardinal two-mile relay team set a
new intercollegiate mark and the
mile relay quartet shattered the
world rcord by more than a second.
And what's more. Ellington tells ev
j erybody that these things are going
j to happen beforehand.
I By way of background for this
world record assault yesterday af

Smashing all existing records fur three-quarters of a mile, Paul Moore
yesterday matched strides with Mushy Girard for three laps and finished
going awav in 2:58.7. the best time ever hung up for the odd distance.
liili Ellington, who makes a habit of forecasting records for his run
ners, freely predicted that Paul would better the world mark; but he

never told anyone that Girard
come in for a share of the glory. And
that's just what Mush did when he j
finished four or five yards behind
his teammate in 3:00.1.
Yesterday's amazing performance
by Stanford distance stars wiped out
the previous mark, Jules Ladoume- j
gue's accepted world record of 3:00.6.
FAST FIRST LAP
Getting oft to a good start, P.iul
moved out in front and was clocked
in 58 sec. {or the first lap, a step :
ahead of Girard, who took over the i
pace for the next 600 yards, leading
Paul through a 61 sec. second lap.
Running smoothly with little evi
dence of his old bobbing, bouncing
stride, Paul showed no sign ol tie
ing up as he passed Mushy at the
end of the back-stretch and came
off the far turn a couple of strides
in front.
He finished with plenty of kick as
Girard slowed down and a shout
from the head timer indicated that
the record had been smashed. A
slight breeze was blowing at the
time of the race, but does not influ
ence any race over a 660.
FOURTH RECORD
It was the fourth great accom
plishment of Ellington's boys this
season. First Clyde Jeffrey, Farm
captain, equalled the record for the
hundred with a 9.4 performance at
the Long Beach Relays. Then the
Cardinal two-mile relay team set a
new intercollegiate mark and the
mile relay quartet shattered the
world rcord by more than a second.
And what's more. Ellington tells ev
j erybody that these things are going
j to happen beforehand.
I By way of background for this
world record assault yesterday af
