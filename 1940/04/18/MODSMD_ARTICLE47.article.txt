# Stanford Nine To Face Bears
## 
### 
Although the stand-out event of
the day at Berkeley this Saturday
may be the Cal-U.S.C. track meet,
there will be a mighty hot game of
baseball played that same afternoon
at Edwards Field.
Foi at that time Stanford's cellar
residing has*, bailers will take an
other whack at a California gang
that beat them 4-0 last Saturday. At
that, the Golden Bears had to play
what their coach, Clint Evans, called
their "best game of the season" to
turn the trick over an Indian nine
which wasn't exactly playing their
best brand of ball.
In view of the inconsistent ball
that both teams have been playing
this season, however, the Bears' vic
tory last Saturday doesn't exactly
make them a sure thing this week.
Cootie Thompson may pull one of
his one or two-hit ball games out
of the bag on the same day that his
team-mates decide to really go to
town at the plate.
If this were to happen Saturday,
the Indians would more than give
Cal a rough time of it; for Stanford
still has the same team (with the
exception of Bill Jameson) that was
rated in pre-season dope to be one
of the top teams in the league this
season.
