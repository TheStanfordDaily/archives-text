# The
						Aftermath

### 
NOW that a fully capable crew of student
body officials has been ushered into office,
it might not be a bad idea to remind those who
aspire to be Stanford's political maestros in 1941
that our nomination system is badly in need of
repair.
No one is denying the fact that a thoroughly
capable ticket was elected and no one fears even
a little that these successful men and women
won't be representative of Stanford. But more
than a few people have commented that too
small a number of candidates had their names
on the ballot. For example, it is absurd for the
Row or the Hall to say that only one man from
among them is worthy enough to be •allowed
the honor and privilege of running for student
body president or other high office.
Of the several men who preferred bucking
caucuses with independent nominations, or even
bucking them with a hurried write-in campaign,
one man drew 307 first choice votes for A.S.S.U.
president. Another candidate spurned by his
colleagues by a house vote of 23 to 9 drew one
and a third times as many votes as did the
caucus choice.
But the faction leaders will argue again next
year that the Row (or the Hall) will win unless
we unite, men. One or two experts in the art
of chug-chug will gather the clan together,
throw out the houses and men opposed to them,
and end up with only one candidate per office.
As in the past, these candidates will probably
be good, reliable timber, but not one machine
boss can honestly say that his product is the
only one to lead the group out of the political
wilderness.
All The Daily asks is that the future bosses
2nd candidates remember that there can be no
party split under the preferential ballot system,
that two, three, even five or six men can run for
a single position without hurting the entity of
the party behind them.
The candidates who ran independently and
as write-ins this year have set the pace for the
future politicos. All of the "forgotten" men of
the present elections will be back to remember
how their little ambitions and hopes were
guashed by steam-roller opposition. Perhaps
they won't want the same thing to happen to
friends of theirs.
No one is saying that the winners of this elec
tion would not have triumphed anyway, but the
same men would have triumphed in a large field
if they were the men that the electorate wanted.
The crime is not in being defeated in an open
election but rather in being denied a chance to
face that electorate on the merits of ability, past
performance, and future promise.
