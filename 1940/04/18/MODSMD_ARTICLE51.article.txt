EVEN though Stanford, according to Herm
Silverman's Gallup-style poll, lists a pre
dominantly "sweet" band as its favorite, Junior
Prom committeemen snapped up the chance to
sign an orchestra whose reputation rests prin
cipally on jazz or swing music.
If it had been any other outfit than Duke El
lington's, whose position among the "greats" of
American music is secure, Greyson Bryan and
his cohorts would have been taking a gamble.
But, after offering traditionally "smooth" Stan
ford a relatively hot band, the class of '41 waited
hopefully, but with some trepidation—until
the Farm's reaction to its move became appar
rent. By yesterday that reaction had cinched
the success of this year's Prom. It is seldom, as
troubled Student Managers can testify, that a
dance sells out its guota of 450 bids two days
before the final night. The Prom did that.
With class coffers already full, Bryan and his
dance committee last night determined not to
pack the Pavilion so that dancing would become
an impossibility. At the same time, in response
to reguests from people who waited too long to
buy their Prom bids, the Juniors agreed to offer
a limited number of additional bids exactly
50—for sale as long as they last.
Stanford may not like swing, but played by
the right crew it's strictly okay. The box office
tells the tale. -D. H.
