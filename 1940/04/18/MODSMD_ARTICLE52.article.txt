THE EDITOR. SIR:
"Smooth" wants to know who in hell Ellington,
lines. Waller, etc., are. To quote trom "Jazzmen."
>ne ol tin.' best books on the subject <»f jazz music; "1

I don't know of any jazz orchestra tor as musically fer
tile as Ellington. In an Ellington performance it is a
rare three minutes in which something of orchestral
fascination doesn't occur. Of how many other bands
can the same be said?"
Hines, Waller, Basie, and Wilson are the four great
est piano players known to jazz today, not to mention
Stacy, Sullivan, Ammonds, Johnson, Mary Lou Wil
liams, and Joe Bushkin.
"Smooth" shows his ignorance of the whole mat
ter when he mentions Erskine Hawkins and Louis
Armstrong in the same breath. Another trumpet play
er, Frankie Newton, is the greatest exponent of the
blues in the Negroid manner. For technical perfec
tion on the trumpet, we must mention Roy Eldridge.
Today, Sidney Bechet is the only soprano sax
player, while Coleman Hawkins is admittedly the
greatest performer on the alto and tenor saxes.
Ray, Lunceford, and Kirk subordinate themselves
to their orchestras, which are among the best in the
country. Cab Calloway and Stulf Smith are showmen
par excellence. Benny Carter can express himself
equally well on any instrument.
Among the musicians mentioned are several top
rank composers. Ellington's "Sophisticated Lady" and
his "Solitude" are jazz classics, while Hayes' "In the
Mood," Smith's "I'se A-Muggin'," Horace and Fletcher
Henderson's "King Porter Stomp" and "Down South
Camp Meetin'," and Mills' "Caravan" have been equally
successful.
Smooth obviously wrote his letter to start an argu
ment. He has one now!
Very truly yours,
George Reis, Jr.
P.S.: If "Smooth" wants to know who the hell
George Washington and Abraham Lincoln are, I'd be
glad to tell him in words of one syllable.

Ray, Lunceford, and Kirk subordinate themselves

Henderson's "King Porter Stomp" and "Down South
Camp Meetin'," and Mills' "Caravan" have been equally
successful.
