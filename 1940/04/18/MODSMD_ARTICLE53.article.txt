# BULL SESSION
## EASTSIDE, WESTSIDE 
### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
jVEW YORK, N.Y.—On the Westside we can see
plainly the huge, beautiful architectural wonders
of New York—Radio City, the Chrysler Building, and
the Park Avenue Apartment Canyon. But we are on
the Eastside, and for blocks around the tenement
houses are filthy, overcrowded. The gutters are dirty
and smelly, so are the sidewalk business stalls, and
so are the $14-a-month rabbit hutches that house
millions of New Yorkers.
There is a sign: "Freshly renovated rooms for rent."
Let's have a look. We walk up three flights of narrow
stairs, and the walls seem to be closing in on us be
cause the air is so fetid. We walk through the door
of our "apartment." It looks like a subdivided Encina
room, except that the walls, light-sockets, and floors
are barren. But this room, we must remember, has
(he luxury of a two-family lavatory—fully three feet
by four. And from the window we can look out on a
sooty brick court, 5 feet by 7, where three families
hang their laundry.
* * * *
I JP another flight of stairs and we can see the roof—
the "top of the tenement." There is a hungry cat
prowling over tarred roofing, and if we climb over
some rusty pipes we can look down. The view is very
inspiring. On one side there is a narrow alley, with
trash and tin cans piled along the edge, and on an
other side there is a panoramic view of our neigh
bors' homes and our neighbors' businesses. There are
maze-like terraces of black fire-escapes and laundry
and trash and ragged looking buildings. And there are
hundreds of side-walk peddlers—offering bargains in
everything from food to clothes.
"Well," asks our landlord agent, "how about it?"
"No, thanks,' we tell him, "the kids wouldn't like
it."
But lots of kids have to like it. Lots of kids have
to get used to the fetid air, and share the four-by-three
lavatory with another family, and look out on dirty
brick and trash-laden alleys for inspiration.
Maybe once in a while they look from the Eastside
to the Westside and see the fifty-million-dollar build
ings jutting into the sky. And maybe a few of them
think as we did—that the trouble with New York tene
ments is that the landlords don't live in them.

prowling over tarred roofing, and if we climb over
some rusty pipes we can look down. The view is very
inspiring. On one side there is a narrow alley, with
trash and tin cans piled along the edge, and on an
other side there is a panoramic view of our neigh
bors' homes and our neighbors' businesses. There are
maze-like terraces of black fire-escapes and laundry
and trash and ragged looking buildings. And there are
hundreds of side-walk peddlers—offering bargains in
everything from food to clothes.
"Well," asks our landlord agent, "how about it?"
"No, thanks,' we tell him, "the kids wouldn't like
it."
But lots of kids have to like it. Lots of kids have
to get used to the fetid air, and share the four-by-three
lavatory with another family, and look out on dirty
brick and trash-laden alleys for inspiration.
Maybe once in a while they look from the Eastside
to the Westside and see the fifty-million-dollar build
ings jutting into the sky. And maybe a few of them
think as we did—that the trouble with New York tene
ments is that the landlords don't live in them.
jVEW YORK, N.Y.—On the Westside we can see
plainly the huge, beautiful architectural wonders
of New York—Radio City, the Chrysler Building, and
the Park Avenue Apartment Canyon. But we are on
the Eastside, and for blocks around the tenement
houses are filthy, overcrowded. The gutters are dirty
and smelly, so are the sidewalk business stalls, and
so are the $14-a-month rabbit hutches that house
millions of New Yorkers.
There is a sign: "Freshly renovated rooms for rent."
Let's have a look. We walk up three flights of narrow
stairs, and the walls seem to be closing in on us be
cause the air is so fetid. We walk through the door
of our "apartment." It looks like a subdivided Encina
room, except that the walls, light-sockets, and floors
are barren. But this room, we must remember, has
(he luxury of a two-family lavatory—fully three feet
by four. And from the window we can look out on a
sooty brick court, 5 feet by 7, where three families
hang their laundry.

I JP another flight of stairs and we can see the roof—
the "top of the tenement." There is a hungry cat
prowling over tarred roofing, and if we climb over
some rusty pipes we can look down. The view is very
inspiring. On one side there is a narrow alley, with
trash and tin cans piled along the edge, and on an
other side there is a panoramic view of our neigh
