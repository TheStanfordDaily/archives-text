# Popper Talks To Lunch Club On Musical Life
## Self-exiled Musician From Czechoslovakia Praises U.S. Genius 
### 
"Europeans think that all Ameri
can musical life is a conglomeration
of fabulously paid Hollywood stars,
mediocre chorals, symphonies, and
chamber musicians. In fact, the
United States is thought to be a sort
of musical exile," joked Dr. Herbert
Jan Popper yesterday when he
spoke before Luncheon Club.
The soft-spoken, dramatic young
Czech conductor delighted lunch
crs with acocunts of experiences of
his musical life in Czecho-Slovakia.
Starting his professional career
when he was 16 years old, Dr. Pop
per described how he accidentally
pushed a button which brought
down the curtain in the middle of
an opera on the night of his debut
as a conductor.
OPERA PRICES LOW
Admission prices to operas arc as
low as 5 cents, in Europe, and the
choicest place in the house isn't over
$1.10. Before the war, Germans and
Czcchoslovakians had their choice
nightly of any of three operas. So
they went to the picture show, in
serted Dr. Popper slyly.
"I was directing the second act of
Tosca one evening when the crisis
came in • September of 1938. We
never started the third act. Scarpio,
who had just been murdered, got
up and donned his uniform when
mobilization was declared. Every
one understood. We had to move in
a hurry.
ENTERS AIR CORPS
"I joined the air corps. One day
the commander lined us up and told
us it was over—for us. They played
the national anthem. That was the
end of Czechoslovakia. But that's
enough of that," and Dr. Popper con
tinued in a lighter vein.
Europe loses its best musicians to
America, because they are better
paid over here, Dr. Popper ex
plained. He believes that such
symphonies as the NBC and such
conductors as Pierre Monteux are
every bit as good as the European
symphonies and conductors.
