### WILSON CANNON 
W/IRES from Rome had the hic
cups again yesterday.
Alternately spluttering friendship
to Berlin and neutrality to London,
Italian communiques again played
the two-handed back-slapping role
(one hand for each side) that has
been characteristic of Mussolini
since the first days of World War 11.
Evidently one of the telegraph op
erators was hiccoughing too. For
once the communiques didn't add up
even. Something which for politique
Italy is quite unbelievable.
Over the tangle of telegraph wires
which emanate from Rome like
spaghetti from a pot came a mes
sage toppling the scales of neutral
ity toward a stronger Rome-Berlin
axis. The message in brief:
"An exchange of military . . .
experts and technicians ... is oc
curring between Italy and Ger
many . . . to maintain constant
contact between the armed forces
of the two nations."
Which may mean anything, but
which on the surface is a thinly
veiled threat that neutral Italy is just
about ready to hop on the Nazi
bandwagon. Perhaps.
Italian-German conversation has
been of the snuggest for the past
month or so. But so has each com
munication from Berlin to London.
Foreign experts last night were of
the opinion that this latest com
munique complicated, rather than
clarified, the situation.
>{: * $
at least the past few days
British and French efforts have
swung between indirect demands
that Italy remain strictly neutral;
and indirect attempts to increase
friendly relations with the Fascist
state.
And they seemed to be gaining
ground. In fact, certain optimistic
Frenchmen were about ready to
discuss a screen test for the shy
Italian belle. Some of them felt
the contract was as good as signed.
Foreign sources which usually
know their bread and butter last
night held to the opinion that the
threatening communique did not
mean much in respect to Italy's im
mediate entry into the conflict. The
reason for it all, they suggested, was
to create Allied concern over such a
possibility.
They have an idea there. Remem
ber the recent British semi-decision
to move part of their Mediterra
nean fleet into the North Sea? Pur
pose of this was to offset recent
gains in Norway by the Reich war
machine.
ITALY has a considerable lleet of
battleships in the Mediterranean.
They also have widely spaced bases
which might control British and
French supply lines from Africa and
the East. They could do a lot of
damage down there if the British
fleet left.
So, as long as the English Cabinet
feels an imminent danger of Italy
entering the war, the British fleet
will remain in the Mediterranean.
To carry the story out still further:
as long as English fleet reserves re
main away from the North Sea, the
German advance will remain prac
tically unchecked.
Good move. Strategic to the nth
degree for Germany.
Italy also pulled a few more
good moves . . . for Germany.
The tone of the official Fascist
press during the past few weeks
lias been noticeably hostile toward
the Allies. Meanwhile, a new
class of men were drafted into
service in Rome. And a yet more
threatening move occurred when
Italy sent 23.000 men to Albania
as "miners."
But most diplomats in London
still believe that Italy will not enter
the war at all. They feel that in
many ways the Fascist nation is not
ready, and that she can never be
completely prepared for war. They
base their claims on Italy's pre
carious defensive position, and her
many vital imports which .she must
have to survive.
They aren't relaxing in London on
that account, however. They have
n't forgotten Italy's newly acquired
aii- strength, and her strategic posi
tion.

They have an idea there. Remem
ber the recent British semi-decision
to move part of their Mediterra
nean fleet into the North Sea? Pur
pose of this was to offset recent
gains in Norway by the Reich war
machine.
ITALY has a considerable lleet of
battleships in the Mediterranean.
They also have widely spaced bases
which might control British and
French supply lines from Africa and
the East. They could do a lot of
damage down there if the British
fleet left.
So, as long as the English Cabinet
feels an imminent danger of Italy
entering the war, the British fleet
will remain in the Mediterranean.
To carry the story out still further:
as long as English fleet reserves re
main away from the North Sea, the
German advance will remain prac
tically unchecked.
Good move. Strategic to the nth
degree for Germany.
Italy also pulled a few more
good moves . . . for Germany.
The tone of the official Fascist
press during the past few weeks
lias been noticeably hostile toward
the Allies. Meanwhile, a new
class of men were drafted into
service in Rome. And a yet more
threatening move occurred when
Italy sent 23.000 men to Albania
as "miners."
But most diplomats in London
still believe that Italy will not enter
the war at all. They feel that in
many ways the Fascist nation is not
ready, and that she can never be
completely prepared for war. They
base their claims on Italy's pre
carious defensive position, and her
many vital imports which .she must
have to survive.
They aren't relaxing in London on
that account, however. They have
n't forgotten Italy's newly acquired
aii- strength, and her strategic posi
tion.

Italy is quite unbelievable.

many . . . to maintain constant
contact between the armed forces
of the two nations."
