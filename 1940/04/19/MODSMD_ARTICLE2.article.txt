# F.D.R. Backs Hull's Stand On Far East
## French Ambassador Regards Statement As 'Right to Point' 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 18 (CI»).
—President Roosevelt toda.v back
ed up Secretary of State Cordcll
Hull's statement that the United
States will look with suspicion
upon any tampering with the
Dutch East Indies, saying Hull's
statement covers the situation
adequately.
Hull yesterday said invasion of
the Netherlands possessions, source
of United States rubber, tin and
other vital supplies, or alteration of
their status quo, would be prejudi
cial to peace in the Pacific.
Mr. Roosevelt discussed the
statement at his semi-weekly press
conference as he prepared to depart
for Warm Springs, Ga., for a delayed
vacation. Length of his visit will de
pend upon foreign developments.
We hope, he said, repeating Hull's
words, that the status quo in the Pa
cific can be maintained in the in
terests of peace.
FRENCH INDORSE STAND
The United States' attitude was
endorsed by French Ambassador
Count Rene de Saint Quentin, who
conferred with Undersecretary of
State Sumner Welles. He said he
did not regard Hull's statement, as a
threat but as a firm statement, right
to the point. Dispatches from Paris
yesterday said France would sup
port whatever position this country
took.
The possibility Hull's maneuver
may be the prelude to economic re
taliation against Japan, should she
invade the Dutch islands, was raised
by Sen. Key Pittman, D., Nev., chair
man of the influential Senate For
eign Relations Committee. From
Reno, Nev., where he is resting,
Pittman warned any Japanese en
croachment would be answered by
economic pressure.
BILLS PIGEON-lIOLED
Significance of this lies in the fact
Pittman's committee has under con
sideration a number of far-reaching
Japanese embargo bills. They were
introduced when nnti-Nippon senti
ment was at high pitch in protest
against mistreatment of Americans
in China, the reason why President
Roosevelt abrogated the U.S."Japa
nese treaty of commerce.
The bills were pigeon-holed for
"future reference" at the request, of
Hull, who asked that he be allowed
a free hand in guiding American
policy in the Orient.
