# 'Little Indian' Stars in Success Story
## Chappieman Dixon Makes Ideas Pay 
### JEFF LITTLEBOY 
The man with a thousand ideas—
that's Jack Dixon, Chappie big
wig and cartoonist extraordinary.
You've seen his cross-eyed Indian
peering pugnaciously from' Stan
ford windshields, with his two red
and white feathers sticking up.
And, too, you've probably noticed
the window full of Indian dolls that
the Bookstore had a short time ago.
Those are Jack s biggest success to
date. The Bookstore was entirely
sold out in four days, and the little
dolls, dressed in green with a big
block "D," are being sold back at
Dartmouth with the same success.
DESIGNS CALENDAR
j Another big Dixon smash hit is
the College Year Calendar which is
tacked to Encina's walls and quite a
few fraternity phone booths. Jack
first got the idea when he drew up
a series of 15 cartoons of the little
Indian, took them downtown to
show them to the local merchants.
Jack was a little skeptical, but the
entrepreneurs seemed to go for the
id^a
"So, I drew up the little Indian in
various poses around the outside of
the card," said Jack, leaning back
against the Chappie's window sill,
"put a calendar in the center of the
sheet, and there it was. I plan to
revise it next year, making the cal
endar a little bigger."
MEETS CARTOONISTS
Jack s main interest since he was
seven years old has been cartooning.
He is largely self-taught, picking up
pointers here and there by corre
sponding with Percy Crosby and
others. Jack once walked three miles
through the rain to meet the late E.
C. Segar, creator of Popeye the
Sailor. Segar, making a radio ap
pearance, took time out to give Jack
an autographed cartoon of Popeye
handing young Mr. Dixon the cus
tomary can of spinach.
At fifteen, while attending Los
Angeles' Belmont High, Jack was
dx-awing a regular strip for the Los
Angeles Shopping News called "Easy
Grumbles. ' An athletic scholarship
in track, of all things, brought him
to the Farm, where he starred on
the staff of Chaparral under Gil
Gist.
PLANS CARTOON SERIES
Right now the center of the Dixon
pinwheel of ideas is a plan for a
political cartoon syndicate. With a
little outside assistance he plans to
sign up a lot of California's small

town independent newspapers, send
ing them six cartoons a week. The
panels would deal with the Califor
nia political arena, adding a few
pertinent penpoints on the inter
national field for good measure.
"Boy, if I can land about a hun
dred papers, I can retire," grinned
Jack.
His major is architectural design
in the Graphic Arts department, and
after graduating this June he would
like to do a "big time" comic strip.
Or, he might even settle for a job
as a movie art director, he thinks.
DOES MOVIE ADS
While attending a movie some
time ago, Jack was sitting with well
concealed boredom through the reel
of plugs for local merchants. Bang!
like that an idea hit him. Why not
add a few cartoon stills and make
the plugs more palatable?
So Jack talked to the theater man
ager, who in turn talked to still
higher ups, and everybody became
more and more enthusiastic. Now,

when the merits of local merchants
are extolled on Paly screens, Stan
fordites can.watch for the little In
dian giving his shirt and moccasins
to a well-known nearby broker.
You'll soon see the sticker Indian
on the backs of playing cards, smiling
this time, for psychology's sake. He
will come in sets of two, with his
girl friend, an entirely new creation,
we were assured, on the alternate
nark

dx-awing a regular strip for the Los
Angeles Shopping News called "Easy
Grumbles. ' An athletic scholarship
in track, of all things, brought him
to the Farm, where he starred on
the staff of Chaparral under Gil
Gist.
PLANS CARTOON SERIES
Right now the center of the Dixon
pinwheel of ideas is a plan for a
political cartoon syndicate. With a
little outside assistance he plans to
sign up a lot of California's small

town independent newspapers, send
ing them six cartoons a week. The
panels would deal with the Califor
nia political arena, adding a few
pertinent penpoints on the inter
national field for good measure.
"Boy, if I can land about a hun
dred papers, I can retire," grinned
Jack.
His major is architectural design
in the Graphic Arts department, and
after graduating this June he would
like to do a "big time" comic strip.
Or, he might even settle for a job
as a movie art director, he thinks.
DOES MOVIE ADS
While attending a movie some
time ago, Jack was sitting with well
concealed boredom through the reel
of plugs for local merchants. Bang!
like that an idea hit him. Why not
add a few cartoon stills and make
the plugs more palatable?
So Jack talked to the theater man
ager, who in turn talked to still
higher ups, and everybody became
more and more enthusiastic. Now,

when the merits of local merchants
are extolled on Paly screens, Stan
fordites can.watch for the little In
dian giving his shirt and moccasins
to a well-known nearby broker.
You'll soon see the sticker Indian
on the backs of playing cards, smiling
this time, for psychology's sake. He
will come in sets of two, with his
girl friend, an entirely new creation,
we were assured, on the alternate
nark

The man with a thousand ideas—
that's Jack Dixon, Chappie big
wig and cartoonist extraordinary.
You've seen his cross-eyed Indian
peering pugnaciously from' Stan
ford windshields, with his two red
and white feathers sticking up.
And, too, you've probably noticed
the window full of Indian dolls that
the Bookstore had a short time ago.
Those are Jack s biggest success to
date. The Bookstore was entirely
sold out in four days, and the little
dolls, dressed in green with a big
block "D," are being sold back at
Dartmouth with the same success.
DESIGNS CALENDAR
j Another big Dixon smash hit is
the College Year Calendar which is
tacked to Encina's walls and quite a
few fraternity phone booths. Jack
first got the idea when he drew up
a series of 15 cartoons of the little
Indian, took them downtown to
show them to the local merchants.
Jack was a little skeptical, but the
entrepreneurs seemed to go for the
id^a
"So, I drew up the little Indian in
various poses around the outside of
the card," said Jack, leaning back
against the Chappie's window sill,
"put a calendar in the center of the
sheet, and there it was. I plan to
revise it next year, making the cal
endar a little bigger."
MEETS CARTOONISTS
Jack s main interest since he was
seven years old has been cartooning.
He is largely self-taught, picking up
pointers here and there by corre
sponding with Percy Crosby and
others. Jack once walked three miles
through the rain to meet the late E.
C. Segar, creator of Popeye the
Sailor. Segar, making a radio ap
pearance, took time out to give Jack
an autographed cartoon of Popeye
handing young Mr. Dixon the cus
