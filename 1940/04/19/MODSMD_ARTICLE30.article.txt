vidual titles.
Vitousek will carry on his i'eud
with S.C.'s Dick Whitney in the
breaststroke and Weeden will be de
fending his backstroke crown from
Burt Smith of Troy and Steve Aran
son of the Bears.
ADAMS INJURED
Howie Adams, Stanford's sopho
more diving sensation, will not be in
good shape but Brnie Brandsten,
Farm springboard coach, is confi
dent that his ace will be able to
compete. Adams injured his ankle
about two weeks ago and has not
worked out in the water for a long
while. Because he is out of condition,
Howie will enter the meet underdog
to Dick Smith of S.C.
Headed by Paul Wolf, freestyle
star, the Trojans should waik away
with the meet. Wolf leads six crack
sprinters into the classic 50-yard field
which is a cinch to better the existing
mark of 24 flat.

ord holders, eight defending con
ference champs, and the finest
