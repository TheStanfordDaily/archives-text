## FRANK GUTHRIE, Sports Editor Stanford Nine to Meet Bears In Second Contest of Series 
### 
For the second Saturday in a row Stanford's baseball club makes the
jaunt across the hay to Edwards Field in the Berkeley hills where they
take on California's Golden Bears. The game will start at approximately
3:30 o'clock, following Ihe C'al-U.S.C. track meet.
Although the Stanford nine was handed its ninth setback of the season

by the Bears last Saturday,
Harry Wolter's outfit is definitely i
out for a win tomorrow. And what's
more, they think that they have a |
good chance of getting that win.
COOTIE TO HURL
The Cards have not had any games
this week, outside of an intrasquad !
fray on Tuesday, while Cal has en
gaged in two contests, winning from |
Santa Clara and Cal Aggies. From
these results it would look as if the
Bears have hit their peak, but they
can't be very much better than they
were last Saturday when they
played errorless ball and clubbed
"Cootie'' Thompson for ten safe- j
ties.
Thompson will have his chance '
for revenge, along with the rest of
the team, for Wolter will send his
big right-hander to the mound to
morrow in an attempt to quiet the
Bears' big bats. Thompson, who
has pitched the Indians to their j
only three victories of the league sea- j
son. has had the scouts watching him j
all season, and will probably be the
center of attraction again tomorrow.
EVANS TO START KOLL
Clint Evans, Cal baseball mentor,
will probably use Mike Koll on the |
hill for his club, hoping that his ace |
will hog-tie the Indians as well as
he did last week when he yielded
only five bingles.
Since Sid Lewis' injury at Cal last
week, Herb Atkinson and Jack Ran
dall have ben battling it out alone
for the catcher's spot, and it looks
as if Atkinson will get the starting
call tomorrow.
Wolter will vise his regular line-up
which is composed of Hal Costello
at first, Harry Parsons at second,
Monte Pfyl at short, Ike Boone at
third, Norm Juney in left field, Alec 1
Cereghino in center field, and Bob j
Templeton in right field.

the team, for Wolter will send his
big right-hander to the mound to
morrow in an attempt to quiet the
Bears' big bats. Thompson, who
has pitched the Indians to their j
only three victories of the league sea- j
son. has had the scouts watching him j
all season, and will probably be the
center of attraction again tomorrow.
EVANS TO START KOLL
Clint Evans, Cal baseball mentor,
will probably use Mike Koll on the |
hill for his club, hoping that his ace |
will hog-tie the Indians as well as
he did last week when he yielded
only five bingles.
Since Sid Lewis' injury at Cal last
week, Herb Atkinson and Jack Ran
dall have ben battling it out alone
for the catcher's spot, and it looks
as if Atkinson will get the starting
call tomorrow.
Wolter will vise his regular line-up
which is composed of Hal Costello
at first, Harry Parsons at second,
Monte Pfyl at short, Ike Boone at
third, Norm Juney in left field, Alec 1
Cereghino in center field, and Bob j
Templeton in right field.
For the second Saturday in a row Stanford's baseball club makes the
jaunt across the hay to Edwards Field in the Berkeley hills where they
take on California's Golden Bears. The game will start at approximately
3:30 o'clock, following Ihe C'al-U.S.C. track meet.
Although the Stanford nine was handed its ninth setback of the season

by the Bears last Saturday,
Harry Wolter's outfit is definitely i
out for a win tomorrow. And what's
more, they think that they have a |
good chance of getting that win.
COOTIE TO HURL
The Cards have not had any games
this week, outside of an intrasquad !
fray on Tuesday, while Cal has en
gaged in two contests, winning from |
Santa Clara and Cal Aggies. From
these results it would look as if the
Bears have hit their peak, but they
can't be very much better than they
were last Saturday when they
played errorless ball and clubbed
"Cootie'' Thompson for ten safe- j
ties.
Thompson will have his chance '
for revenge, along with the rest of
the team, for Wolter will send his
big right-hander to the mound to
