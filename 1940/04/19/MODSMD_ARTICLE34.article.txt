# Farm Skiers Win Fifth at Yosemite
## 
### 
With snow melting fast from the !
j ski grounds, spring skiing is prac
tically over. The Stanford ski team, j
in its last competition for this season,
took fifth place in the Vanderbilt
Meet which was held at Yosemite
last week-end.
Bill Janss and Bud McDuffie, who i
have been the mainstays of the team 1
i this year, were unable to attend the
\ meet. Stanford took a third in the
j cross country race and a fourth in
: the slalom. California placed first in
I the meet.
Already Ski Club members are
I looking forward to next year's ski
ing. Stan Vanderburgh, competing
I for the first time last week-end,
; shows considerable promise, accord
ing to Jack Ditz, two-year member
of the team. Vanderburgh and Bob !
Shiner, another newcomer, will be
welcome additions to the team, espe- j
i cially since Janss and McDuffie will ;
| probably not return. Bill Pitcher,
who did not ski with the team this '
j year, will return next season. He
and Ditz will be the only team mem- !
I bers with experience in competition j
behind them.
