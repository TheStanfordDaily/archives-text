# First Grid Scrum Scheduled Tuesday
## 
### 
gridders may get their first
taste of contact work in next Tues
day's open practice. Present indi
cations are that the initial scrim
mage of spring practice will take
place then.
There will probably be some con
tact work in this afternoon's secret
session, but at present Coach Clark
Shaughnessy doesn't intend to send
his charges through a full fledged
scrum until next week.
Over 2,000,000 cases of sardines
were packed in Maine in 1939.
