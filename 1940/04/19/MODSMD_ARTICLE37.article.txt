# Netmen to Close Season Against Bears Tomorrow
## 
### CUES SAROYAN 
Gunning for ;» revenge victory, the Indian netters will take the varsity
ccurta tomorrow afternoon at 1:30 o'clock to meet the strong I'niversitv
of California netmen. This is the final match for the Indians this year, and
it should give the fans a maximum of thrills.
Leading the Cards against the Hears will be sophomore Larry Dee,

w|io will draw either Bob Harmony
or Bob Peacock of California. In
the first match, Dee met Peacock
and soundly thrashed him 6-1, 6-4, ■
and so the Bears may choose the I
steady, back-court player Harmon
to face Dee. In either case the fans
will be treated to some of the finest
tennis that can be seen.
WADE IS UNDERDOG
In the second spot for the Cards '
is another sophomore, Jimmy Wade.
Wade will face either Harmon or j
Peacock and whichever he docs (
draw, he will take the court a slight
underdog. In the first match, he I
battled with Harmon and was de
feated. 6-3, 6-3.
Following Wade for Stanford is
Bob Low. Low will probably face
Bob Hippensteil, whom he beat last
time in three hard sets. Hippensteil
is a superb volleyer and should give
the crowd a nice show.
BROCK TO I'LAY SWAN
Following these three will be
Lloyd Gates, who will probably meet
Cal's Bill Canning, Captain Dave
Brock, who meets Bill Swan, and
Jim Seaver, who will match strokes
with Gunny Ammonette.
The freshman tennis men will also ;
be busy, meeting the California J
Bear Cubs at 9:30 o'clock Saturday
morning. The freshmen are unde- I
feated so far this year in team play, I
but will be facing their strongest
competitors this Saturday. Leading
the frosh will be Tom Kruger,
Charles Hutcheson. Emery Neale, and
Harper Ink in that order.
