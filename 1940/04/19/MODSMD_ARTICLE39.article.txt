# Papooses to Play Cub Diamondmen
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman baseball team
will travel to Berkeley tomorrow to
play the Cal frosh in the second of
their annual series. Last week at Cal,
the frosh dropped a wild 15-12 deci
sion to end their eight-game win
streak.
Only probable line-up change
will be the substitution in right field
of little Harry Miller, who picked up
two hits in Tuesday's win over
Menlo J. C. Phil Wolf, victim of his
own wildness and 11 errors, will
agani hurl for Coach Ait Esslingcr's
men.
The tilt will start, at 9:45 o'clock
on Edward Field. Next Saturday the
Cal Cubs come here for the final
tussle of the series and the season.
Hereford cattle were introduced
into America in 1817 by Henry
Clay.
