SOMEBODY is bound to laugh because Stan
ford is having a Peace Day. A good many
more, especially those who saw and believed
"All Quiet on the Western Front" last night,
will follow the discussions today with marked
interest and with the fervent hope that they can
contribute even a little to the United States'
position as a neutral.
On April 1, 1917, David Starr Jordan was
giving a speech in Baltimore protesting against
the impending participation of his country in
the European war. The meeting was broken up
by a wildly excited mob which did not care to
listen to Dr. Jordan's sincere yet apparently
hopeless plea for non-intervention.
The leader of that mob was a 20-year-old stu
dent, supposedly of sound mind and body. Ten
years later he wrote the following apology to
Dr. Jordan:
"It was not pleasant for you to be subjected
to that experience on that Sunday evening long
ago. It is not pleasant for me to recall that I
ever permitted myself to be urged on to such
an unreasoning and unreasoned act.
"At least you will permit me to tell you that
I know now, what you knew then; that you were
guided by the nobility of human reason and that
1 was under the spell of an artificially engen
dered hysteria of that type which always has
and always will militate against individual and
social well-being until all men burst free from
the aggressive totejns and taboos of class and
creed and emerge into the freedom of individual
reason.
"From my present point of view this causes
me to fear that history may view with highly
critical and doubtful eyes, the boasted idealism
which allegedly caused our participation in the
World War.
"I assure you that experience and maturity
have brought me the poignant realization that
on that Sunday evening so long ago, you were
motivated by the principles of civilization, while
1 was motivated by the passions of barbarism.''
The most unfortunate part of the peace di
lemma in present-day America is that this same
type of psychology, propaganda, or what have
you, is taking a terrific effect. Those of you
who josh at the prospect for war need only to
read a few of the obviously biased and often
times unintelligent criticisms of a certain coun
try in the present fiasco. A quick look at Cam
pus Opinion might suffice for an unexpurgated
example. Propaganda is a powerful weapon but
it takes a lot of weak-minded suckers and a
good many more young men of cannon fodder
age to put it into effect.
Propaganda, it might be added, comes from
both sides of the fence in any conflict. If Hitler
were even one-tenth the ogre that the British,
French (and not a few Americans) would have
us believe that he is, he would spit fire, wag his
tail, and possess a pair of the sharpest, ugliest
of horns.
But Hitler is only a man, whose methods might
be distasteful to some but who is no more
absurd than his French or British enemies.
There is no honor or glory in war. The military
geniuses and diplomats on both sides are
equally voracious. Glory to them is the privilege
of being asked to put the annual wreath on the
tomb of their respective unknown soldiers.
Student attempts at peace demonstrations are
to be commended from every angle. The type
of discussions to be held at Stanford today, with
no banners, no red-hot agitators, is especially
advantageous.
The very sight of college students still asking
for peace and maintaining a strict personal neu
trality is more rare than it was a year, even six
months, ago. A propaganda for peace in the
proper channels can be just as devastating to
the war-mongers as the mob psychology on
the other hand is to peace.
After all, it's better to fight for peace now
instead of crying for the fake idealists' scalps
from a mud-hole somewhere in the middle of
Europe.

have brought me the poignant realization that
on that Sunday evening so long ago, you were
motivated by the principles of civilization, while
1 was motivated by the passions of barbarism.''
The most unfortunate part of the peace di
lemma in present-day America is that this same
type of psychology, propaganda, or what have
you, is taking a terrific effect. Those of you
who josh at the prospect for war need only to
read a few of the obviously biased and often
times unintelligent criticisms of a certain coun
try in the present fiasco. A quick look at Cam
pus Opinion might suffice for an unexpurgated
example. Propaganda is a powerful weapon but
it takes a lot of weak-minded suckers and a
good many more young men of cannon fodder
age to put it into effect.
Propaganda, it might be added, comes from
both sides of the fence in any conflict. If Hitler
were even one-tenth the ogre that the British,
French (and not a few Americans) would have
us believe that he is, he would spit fire, wag his
tail, and possess a pair of the sharpest, ugliest
of horns.
But Hitler is only a man, whose methods might
be distasteful to some but who is no more
absurd than his French or British enemies.
There is no honor or glory in war. The military
geniuses and diplomats on both sides are
equally voracious. Glory to them is the privilege
of being asked to put the annual wreath on the
tomb of their respective unknown soldiers.
Student attempts at peace demonstrations are
to be commended from every angle. The type
of discussions to be held at Stanford today, with
no banners, no red-hot agitators, is especially
advantageous.
The very sight of college students still asking
for peace and maintaining a strict personal neu
trality is more rare than it was a year, even six
months, ago. A propaganda for peace in the
proper channels can be just as devastating to
the war-mongers as the mob psychology on
the other hand is to peace.
After all, it's better to fight for peace now
instead of crying for the fake idealists' scalps
from a mud-hole somewhere in the middle of
Europe.
SOMEBODY is bound to laugh because Stan
ford is having a Peace Day. A good many
more, especially those who saw and believed
"All Quiet on the Western Front" last night,
will follow the discussions today with marked
interest and with the fervent hope that they can
contribute even a little to the United States'
position as a neutral.
On April 1, 1917, David Starr Jordan was
giving a speech in Baltimore protesting against
the impending participation of his country in
the European war. The meeting was broken up
by a wildly excited mob which did not care to
listen to Dr. Jordan's sincere yet apparently
hopeless plea for non-intervention.
The leader of that mob was a 20-year-old stu
dent, supposedly of sound mind and body. Ten
years later he wrote the following apology to
Dr. Jordan:
"It was not pleasant for you to be subjected
to that experience on that Sunday evening long
ago. It is not pleasant for me to recall that I
ever permitted myself to be urged on to such
an unreasoning and unreasoned act.
"At least you will permit me to tell you that
I know now, what you knew then; that you were
guided by the nobility of human reason and that
1 was under the spell of an artificially engen
dered hysteria of that type which always has
and always will militate against individual and
social well-being until all men burst free from
the aggressive totejns and taboos of class and
creed and emerge into the freedom of individual
reason.
"From my present point of view this causes
me to fear that history may view with highly
critical and doubtful eyes, the boasted idealism
which allegedly caused our participation in the
World War.
"I assure you that experience and maturity
have brought me the poignant realization that
on that Sunday evening so long ago, you were
motivated by the principles of civilization, while

from a mud-hole somewhere in the middle of
Europe.
