STANFORD'S Board of Trustees did not take
up the question of a raise in tuition at their
regular meeting yesterday, according to reports
given The Daily last night.
This does not mean, of course, that the Trus
tees have definitely dropped the fee boost plan
that so many authorities on the Farm's financial
situation claimed would be necessary to retain
the status quo of Stanford as a "top-rate" insti
tution. It does show that the idea of a raise must
be worrying them, the sponsors of the Univer
sity, as much as it has been some of the stu
dents who fear the financial worst.
The Daily has received no sure fire hint as to

the amount or even the probability of a boast.
A hazy tip that the Trustees would okeh a hike
to $150.00 a quarter, including community lees
and syllabus payments, may or may not be au
thentic.
At any rate The Daily is not worried about the
situation, raise or no raise. Stanford gets its
income from student lees, endowments, and
interest on investments. The endowments,
though persistently sought, are not high; the
interest rates are farcical.
So if Stanford is really in a serious financial
way as Mr. Hoover told us, where else can she
expect aid except from the students themselves?
