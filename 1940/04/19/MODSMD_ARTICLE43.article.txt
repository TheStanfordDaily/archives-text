## WE CAN DO NO WRONG 
### 
EDITOR, SIR:
May I relieve the pent-upness, and say a word
about "Germany's final horrible state of collapse" after
the Versailles Treaty?
Germany never was invaded—she did not lose a
fence post or a pane of glass in a window—so none of
her remaining assets went to repair. Instead of feed
ing and rehabilitating her depressed and poverty
stricken populace, what did she do? Kept on depress
ing and poverty-striking them by using all her assets,
all her energies in preparing munitions, etc., for more
bloody excursions.
I'm sorry, but I continue to think that Germany had
a perfectly "fair chance to rebuild herself," and the
United States have always been more than kind and
just.
M. J.
