SOME NATIONAL SENTIMENT
/'HICAGO. —The first speaker for the University of
A Chicago in our debate today began: "It is prob
ably safe to say that 90 per cent of this audience wants
Great Britain and France to win the war." And the
Chicago man was right. It was a safe guess.
All over the country sentiment seems to be strongly
on the Allied side—but with prominent reservations.
Most of the college students we have met at least are
careful to say, "We would be foolish to join the Allies
in war, but we should sell them supplies." Most col
lege students don't give much thought to the war—
they talk more about campus politics and dates and
athletics. But when they do express an opinion, it is
the hope that the Allies will win, with a strong preju
dice against a second American intervention.
But Hitler's latest invasions seem to have done two
things to popular opinion: First, there is more interest
in the European War. And second, pro-Allies senti
ment has grown. A Columbia student said, "We can't
let England lose. No, I don't think we should declare
war on Germany—not now anyway. But we can't
let England lose."
And a rabid Texan train conductor was a little moi - e
democratic. "Democracy is making its last stand in
Europe," he said. "If we have to we ought to help
England."

on the street and in busses and in coffee shops
people of all classes are more concerned than ever
about the Second World War. "Say, those Nazis sure
are smart," a New York policeman commented, as he
munched his doughnuts at a lunch counter. "Looks like
England isn't going to have a very easy time of it.
Wouldn't be surprised to see us in it again."
The headlines scream, and the people talk. Senti
ment for the Allies is wavering between "The Yanks
won't come again" arrd "We can't let England lose."
One begins to think the New York debaters we met
were correct when they argued, "If the Allies are be
ing badly beaten, it will not be hard to get America
to help them."
All this may depress Adolf Hitler to a mild state
of hypomania. But it sobers up any believer in peace
with a good serious shock. America is by no means
immune to war hysteria. And events in Denmark and
Norway are building up tremendous pressure.
If we stay out of Europe's second war in a quarter
of a century, it will probably be because we are not
needed.
