## OVER THERE 
### DOUG JAQUES 
Smooth like the month of May he was when he
called her on the phone before the dance. "What color
dress are you going to be wearing?" he asked. "I
want to get you a corsage. What color dress will you
have?"'
And it was fixed.
The night of the dance he had the corsage. He was
double-dating with a guy in the other guy's car, and
he left the corsage theie.
Then he had to go ofT about some business. The
business took longer than he had expected. By the
time he got back, his friend and the car had gone.
After his friend picked his girl up, he heard
something rattling 011 the shelf in the back of his
car. "See what that noise is," he said to the girl.
She looked. "It's a box."
"Let's see it." She brought it out. "Well, open
it up."
When she saw the corsage, she snuggled up
(which is a tip, friend, if you are having trouble
that way). "Oh, you darling," she said.
He gulped. "Yeah." She pinned on the corsage.
But. to get back to the guy who had bought the
thing. He picked up his dale and got to the dance in
one way or another. He didn't mention the corsage.
Neither did she.
But when they were dancing, suddenly she said.
"Ah, I'm wearing that dress you asked about."
"Oh. You're wondering where that corsage is."
"Well, yes. Ah, where is it?"
"Over there," he said, pointing to a girl and a cor
sage who were dancing close to a guy.
