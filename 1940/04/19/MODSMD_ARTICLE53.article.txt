•TOO MANY HUSBANDS," now
playing at the Stanford Theater.
It seems that she was young and
beautiful and married. Then her
husband was drowned and, after
a suitable interim, she married her
dead husband's best friend. But—it
so happens that the first husband
wasn't dead, and he romped back
into her life making the lady an in
advertent bigamist; and the second
husband very upset indeed.
That's the plot of "Too Many
Husbands." As I recall, Enoch Ar
den was much the same. However,
this time it's funny. Well—fairly
funny. The thing about this show is
that the principles have to work so
hard to keep themselves cute, and
light, and gay. You get just a little
tired of their particular problem.
PLOT RUNS THIN
The people involved include Fred !
Mac Murray (Husband No. 1), Mel
vyn Douglas (Husband No. 2) and
Jean Arthur (their simultaneous
wife). With three such slick come
dians in the opus, you'd have a right
ot expect more than you actually
get. What's there simply isn't suf
ficient to make a movie of this
length consistently interesting.
Of the three, Jean Arthur is the
best. Douglas and Mac Murray look
pretty foolish in a foolish situation.
They did manage to hold up pretty
well for the first half of the picture,
but being touseled and belligerent
for all that time just didn't work
out for either of them.
NO DECISION BOUT
Apparently the authors couldn't
figure this one out either; so they
tacked on one of those "The Lady
or the Tiger" endings. In case you
don't remember just what that is,
it simply means that nothing is de- j
cided—that the lady doesn't know ■
who she loves and nobody knows |
where they stand, including the au- j
dience.
Noel Coward did this sort of thing j
in "Design for Living"; and nobody j
could figure that one out either, i
Noel Coward got away with it be- i
cause he is Noel Coward—whatever |
that may or may not mean—and be- J
sides he made his play so funny that ]
you didn't mind the up-in-the-air
ending. The scenarists for "Too
Many Husbands" are awfully not
Noel Coward; they just didn't get
away with it.—Nowell

beautiful and married. Then her
husband was drowned and, after
a suitable interim, she married her
dead husband's best friend. But—it
so happens that the first husband
wasn't dead, and he romped back
into her life making the lady an in
advertent bigamist; and the second
husband very upset indeed.
That's the plot of "Too Many
Husbands." As I recall, Enoch Ar
den was much the same. However,
this time it's funny. Well—fairly
funny. The thing about this show is
that the principles have to work so
hard to keep themselves cute, and
light, and gay. You get just a little
tired of their particular problem.
PLOT RUNS THIN
The people involved include Fred !
Mac Murray (Husband No. 1), Mel
vyn Douglas (Husband No. 2) and
Jean Arthur (their simultaneous
wife). With three such slick come
dians in the opus, you'd have a right
ot expect more than you actually
get. What's there simply isn't suf
ficient to make a movie of this
length consistently interesting.
Of the three, Jean Arthur is the
best. Douglas and Mac Murray look
pretty foolish in a foolish situation.
They did manage to hold up pretty
well for the first half of the picture,
but being touseled and belligerent
for all that time just didn't work
out for either of them.
NO DECISION BOUT
Apparently the authors couldn't
figure this one out either; so they
tacked on one of those "The Lady
or the Tiger" endings. In case you
don't remember just what that is,
it simply means that nothing is de- j
cided—that the lady doesn't know ■
who she loves and nobody knows |
where they stand, including the au- j
dience.
Noel Coward did this sort of thing j
in "Design for Living"; and nobody j

Noel Coward got away with it be- i
cause he is Noel Coward—whatever |
that may or may not mean—and be- J
sides he made his play so funny that ]
you didn't mind the up-in-the-air
ending. The scenarists for "Too
Many Husbands" are awfully not
Noel Coward; they just didn't get
away with it.—Nowell
