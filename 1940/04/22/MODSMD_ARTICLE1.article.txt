### WILSON CANNON 
J>RESS dispatches over the week
end told an almost unbelievable
story of German preparedness.
They hinted that Hitler has been
ready for seven years for the daring
move into Norway which took place
two weeks ago. The story goes that
Der Fuehrer discussed the basis of
the plan with his aides in 1934.
One usually reliable source added
a different twist to the tale. This
source believed that in 1934 Hitler
had two plans in mind. The other
was a thrust into Holland.
You can take the story or leave it.
One thing is certain, however.
The little nation of the Nether
lands had a narrow escape. Pos
sibly the main reason they were
not invaded was because the Ger
mans arc not yet ready for a
major offensive.
But there were other reasons.
First, while Holland bases would
be better for attacks on London,
they are poorly situated for attacks
on the British fleet. Holland is a
long way from English convoy
lanes in the North Sea.
Hitler likes to do things in a
manner spectacular. And to his way
of thinking, a quick dash into Nor
way would have good chance of
success. A similar victory in Hol
land would have been only prob
able.
Der Fuehrer thought he could be
intrenched in Norway before the
Allies would have time to act. Only
stumbling block proved to be the
British fleet. It refused to play ball.
* * +
AS a result of the British dropping
the defensive, last week's naval
engagement, which covered a thou
sand-mile sea front, may be more
decisive than memorable Jutland.
But last week's battle differed en
tirely from Jutland. Jutland was
a massed affair, fought fleet against
fleet in the open sea. Last week's
battle was fought at close range,
fitted to the German closed-sea
strategy. It proved to be a battle of
air power versus sea might.
Moreover, the Germans had the
advantage of operating from bases
close to the scene of battle. Eng
land was forced to bring her fleet
from the distantly located British
Isles.
Read dispatches concerning the
battle. The British heavy craft were
merely playing a supporting role. It
was their light cruisers and subs
which carried the leading parts. This
type of vessel could fight the type of
battle with much greater efficiency.
♦ * *
motive behind last week's en
gagement differed as much from
Jutland as did the two battles them
selves., In 1916 Jutland was merely
a phase of a bigger battle waging
on the Western Front. Today the
Western Front is quiet, and the sea
battle may prove to be the main
scene of operations.
If the German threat proves
successful it may change the char
acter of World War 11. Today the
smaller neutrals know their fate
may depend upon the outcome of
the Scandinavian conflict. They
have not picked sides yet . . . hut
they will have to soon.
And the big bear of Russia is
looking for some tidbit. Stalin and
company would not mind finishing
Finland and dividing Sweden and
Germany. Russia may have the
chance, if the Reich wins in Nor
way.
Then again, Italy is not going to
wait too much longer. If she sees
the winning side she will jump. And
Italy's leanings toward the Reich
arc well known.
The boys are getting ready to play
ball. And the teams will be picked
any day now.

a massed affair, fought fleet against

J>RESS dispatches over the week
end told an almost unbelievable
story of German preparedness.
They hinted that Hitler has been
ready for seven years for the daring
move into Norway which took place
two weeks ago. The story goes that
Der Fuehrer discussed the basis of
the plan with his aides in 1934.
One usually reliable source added
a different twist to the tale. This
source believed that in 1934 Hitler
had two plans in mind. The other
was a thrust into Holland.
You can take the story or leave it.
One thing is certain, however.
The little nation of the Nether
lands had a narrow escape. Pos
sibly the main reason they were
not invaded was because the Ger
mans arc not yet ready for a
major offensive.
But there were other reasons.
First, while Holland bases would
be better for attacks on London,
they are poorly situated for attacks
on the British fleet. Holland is a
