## 
### 
In a Pavilion decorated exclu
sively in "black and white," 1,000
dancing Stanfordites heard Duke El
lington and his famous band play
last Friday night, at the Junior Prom.
Mixing tunes of fast and slow
tempo, Ellington played in the dis
tinctive style that has brought him
the title of "the man who has con
tributed most to the development
of modern American music." Chair
manned by Grcyson Bryan, the class
of '41 affair was semi-formal.
