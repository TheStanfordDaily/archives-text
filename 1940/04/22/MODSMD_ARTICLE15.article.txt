# Cottrell Tells Of New Fields In Private Aid
## 
### ROSEMARIE MULLANY 
There is a popular suspicion
among students that their professors
exist in an academic cloister un
touched by the practical aspects of
life.
One of several notable exceptions
to this reputed truth is Professor
Edwin A. Cottrell, head of the po
litical science department, who re
cently returned from Pasadena,
where he conducted a survey of
welfare agencies, private and public.
Purpose of the study was to deter
mine whether public agencies will
absorb the private groups or if the
two can still function purposefully.
RELATES FINDINGS
Mr. Cottrell leaned back in his
swivel chair so that his head and
shoulders occupied the only bit of
wall space in his office not taken up
by bookcases and he related some
of his findings.
In the course of the study he dis
covered that the public agencies have
so categorized those whom they will
benefit that, the private agencies can
perform the function of taking care
of those categorically excluded.
'Mr. Cottrell illustrated this situa
tion from another angle. "In caring
for her aged, California has re
duced the age level for benefits and
has increased the rates, at the same
time eliminating aliens and other
groups from relief eligibility. This
circumstance gives private welfare a
field in which to function."
RECREATION NEGLECTED
A sidelight on the welfare study
made in Pasadena's that city's prob
lem of recreational facilities for the
youth. Mr. Cottrell declared that
the problem is aggravated by the at
tempted solution of the more obvious
issue of the excess of aged people in
the community. Consequently pro
visions for recreation have been
neglected and only recently have
steps in the other direction been
taken.
"One recent development in Pasa
dena's life for youth," the Shake
spearean Mr. Cottrell continued, "is
the sponsorship by the city of bi
weekly dances, admission charge, 25
cents. The city takes in about $80,000
annually on this account, but puts
most of it back into big name
bands."
REPORT TO IJE PUBLISHED
Mr. Cottrell made his study inde
pendently for Pasadena and his re
port is now being published by the
University Press. He has been at
Stanford for 20 years and received
his own education at Swarthmore
and Harvard.
"You hear more of Swarthmore
now than you did when I went
there," he said thoughtfully.
