# Wilbur Asserts Understanding Will Aid Peace
## Man's Brutal Qualities Must Be Recognized, Says Farm President 
### JACK DALTON 
An understanding of human
problems and how to deal with
them must he had if the human
family is to abolish war, Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur asserted
in his Peace Day address here
Friday.
In a University assembly observ
ing National Peace Day, Dr. Wilbur
said that if human dignity and the
freedom of the individual "to grow
and to age" are not preserved, there
is little hope for a better world
order.
"War and other terrible things
have always existed," he said, "and
will continue to exist unless we
learn to control our emotions. Com
petition for the things that life re
quires seems to be an essential ele
ment of nature and war is a mani
festation of this competition."
RECOGNIZES BRUTALITY
Dr. Wilbur said "50,000 years of
hell-raising" has shown there are
certain brutal qualities in man which
must be recognized, but controlled.
The progress we have made, how
ever little, holds out the hope that
world unity can be brought about
if we think in terms of constructive
instead of destructive elements, he
maintained.
"As time goes on, I have less re
spect for the 'nation'," he stated.
"The nation, as such, is asking too
much of its people.
IRONIC CITIZENSHIP
"To bring up a young man to be a
good citizen, and then give him a
bayonet to stick in an enemy stom
ach hardly seems compatible with
our standards of value."
Dr. Wilbur emphasized that the
security of peace depends on con
cessions we make to those less for
tunate. He maintained the security
we want can not be attained by
grabbing what we want., but, must
come about by generous concessions
of all peoples.
HOPE FOR PROGRESS
"If order, rather than disorder, in
international relations is brought
about, there is a chance of a grad
ual progress toward world unity," he
said.
"If international fellowship is ever
to be achieved," asserted Dr. Wil
bur, "large concessions will have to
be made by the United States. We
must not point, the way and then
back out ignobly as we did in the
case of the League of Nations."

IRONIC CITIZENSHIP
"To bring up a young man to be a
good citizen, and then give him a
bayonet to stick in an enemy stom
ach hardly seems compatible with
our standards of value."
Dr. Wilbur emphasized that the
security of peace depends on con
cessions we make to those less for
tunate. He maintained the security
we want can not be attained by
grabbing what we want., but, must
come about by generous concessions
of all peoples.
HOPE FOR PROGRESS
"If order, rather than disorder, in
international relations is brought
about, there is a chance of a grad
ual progress toward world unity," he
said.
"If international fellowship is ever
to be achieved," asserted Dr. Wil
bur, "large concessions will have to
be made by the United States. We
must not point, the way and then
back out ignobly as we did in the
case of the League of Nations."
An understanding of human
problems and how to deal with
them must he had if the human
family is to abolish war, Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur asserted
in his Peace Day address here
Friday.
In a University assembly observ
ing National Peace Day, Dr. Wilbur
said that if human dignity and the
freedom of the individual "to grow
and to age" are not preserved, there
is little hope for a better world
order.
"War and other terrible things
have always existed," he said, "and
will continue to exist unless we
learn to control our emotions. Com
petition for the things that life re
quires seems to be an essential ele
ment of nature and war is a mani
festation of this competition."
RECOGNIZES BRUTALITY
Dr. Wilbur said "50,000 years of
hell-raising" has shown there are
certain brutal qualities in man which
must be recognized, but controlled.
The progress we have made, how
ever little, holds out the hope that
world unity can be brought about
if we think in terms of constructive
instead of destructive elements, he
maintained.
"As time goes on, I have less re
spect for the 'nation'," he stated.
"The nation, as such, is asking too
much of its people.
