# Round Table Discussion Leaders Offer Economic Conference as War Cure
## Lanz, Stuart Advocate Propaganda, Respect for Treaties as Solutions Of Future International Conflicts 
### 
In two round table Peace Day discussions last Friday, three authorities
on peace agreed that a world economic conference is an essential prelimi
nary to the establishment of peace among nations.
In one discu-ssion, Professor Graham Stuart of the political science de
partment declared only a complete respect for treaties could keep nations

.from war.
Professor Stuart said the time
when profits could bo made from
wars has passed, and any future
wars would be mere repetitions of
the last World War, which resulted
in loss to all of the nations involved.
U.S. WILL CO-OPERATE
He was certain that the United
States would be glad to enter an in
ternational economic conference.
Professor Stuart said he realized
that certain nations would inevi
tably violate such a system, and
proposed a quarantine of aggressor
nations which all other countries
would enforce.
MOVE TOWARD PEACE
He also suggested that peace
could be more easily achieved if the
Orient and Europe would unite as
have the American nations. That
would make a system of regional
sanctions more practicable, and less
en the risk of wars arising over
petty international quarrels.
"It is impossible to predict accu
rately the part that the United States
may have in this present war," Pro
fessor Stuart said, "but if it goes
on long enough, we're bound to gel
in."
In discussing "The Impractical As
pects of World Peace," Dr. Henry
Lanz, associate professor of Slavic
languages, stated that propaganda
would be the most effective means
of keeping this country out of war.
ANTI-WAR PROPAGANDA
Dr. Lanz's type of propaganda
would be one that emphasized the
wide divergence between the aims
with which a country enters a war
and the final results of the conflict.
He illustrated this point by recall
ing that America entered the last war
to make the world safe for democ
racy.
The Reverend Mr. S. C. Peabody,
Congregational minister from San
Jose, joined Mr. Lanz' group with a
Quaker point of view. Terming
this modern world as "hypnotized by
hate," Reverend Peabody advised
complete disarmament as the first
step in correcting war wrongs. He
believed that the present evils could
be solved by international economic
conferences of a world-wide federal
government.

wars would be mere repetitions of
the last World War, which resulted
in loss to all of the nations involved.
U.S. WILL CO-OPERATE
He was certain that the United
States would be glad to enter an in
ternational economic conference.
Professor Stuart said he realized
that certain nations would inevi
tably violate such a system, and
proposed a quarantine of aggressor
nations which all other countries
would enforce.
MOVE TOWARD PEACE
He also suggested that peace
could be more easily achieved if the
Orient and Europe would unite as
have the American nations. That
would make a system of regional
sanctions more practicable, and less
en the risk of wars arising over
petty international quarrels.
"It is impossible to predict accu
rately the part that the United States
may have in this present war," Pro
fessor Stuart said, "but if it goes
on long enough, we're bound to gel
in."
In discussing "The Impractical As
pects of World Peace," Dr. Henry
Lanz, associate professor of Slavic
languages, stated that propaganda
would be the most effective means
of keeping this country out of war.
ANTI-WAR PROPAGANDA
Dr. Lanz's type of propaganda
would be one that emphasized the
wide divergence between the aims
with which a country enters a war
and the final results of the conflict.
He illustrated this point by recall
ing that America entered the last war
to make the world safe for democ
racy.
The Reverend Mr. S. C. Peabody,
Congregational minister from San
Jose, joined Mr. Lanz' group with a
Quaker point of view. Terming
this modern world as "hypnotized by
hate," Reverend Peabody advised
complete disarmament as the first
step in correcting war wrongs. He
believed that the present evils could
be solved by international economic
conferences of a world-wide federal
government.
In two round table Peace Day discussions last Friday, three authorities
on peace agreed that a world economic conference is an essential prelimi
nary to the establishment of peace among nations.
In one discu-ssion, Professor Graham Stuart of the political science de
partment declared only a complete respect for treaties could keep nations

.from war.
