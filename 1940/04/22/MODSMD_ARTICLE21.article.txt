# N.Y. Train Crash Toll Set at Thirty
## 
### 
LITTLE FALLS, N.Y., April 21
(UP). â€”The New York Central Rail
road tonight officially placed the
death toll in the wreck of its crack
Lake Shore Limited at 30.
Three separate agencies began in
vestigating the cause of the accident,
second worst in the state's history.
The luxury New York-to-Chicago
night express jumped the tracks and
piled into a cliff at 11:315 Friday
night, crumpling the heavy steel
locomotive as if it were cardboard
and heaping on top of it in a jum
bled pile the mail car and Pullmans
filled with sleeping passengers.
A wrecking crew of 300 men, ham
pered by heavy snow and rain which
have been falling intermittently for
most of the last two days, continued
to cut their way through twisted
debris with acetylene torches on the
off-chance of finding still more
bodies.
