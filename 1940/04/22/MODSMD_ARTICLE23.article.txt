## 
### 
STOCKHOLM, April 21 (UP). —
British and Norwegian troops sup
ported by tanks were reported with
out confirmation tonight to have
captured the town of Hamar from
the Germans in fierce hand-to-hand
fighting along the eastern shore of
Lake Mjoesa.
The Norwegian legation said it
"believed" the British forces fight
ing alongside the Norwegians were
in control of the town, 60 miles
north of Oslo, to which King Haakon
and the Norwegian government first
lied after the German "protective"
occupation of Oslo on April 9.
SURPRISE ATTACK
The British were reported to have
taken the German forces in the town
I y surprise when they swept upon
il late last night after landing from
troopships at the west coast railroad
terminal of Andalsnes 115 miles
south of Trondheim which the Nazis
hold, and being rushed cross-country
by train.
However, British quarters in
Stockholm admitted that the re
ported capture of Hamar seemed
"100 good to be true" although they
added that it seemed obvious that a
combined British and Norwegian
army was near Hamar and nearby
Elverurn.
Faced with the strong pressure of
British and Norwegian forces fight

ing together to drive the Germans
out of Norway, the Nazi high com
mand was reported in Swedish
frontier dispatches to be pouring
great numbers of reinforcements
into Norway by plane.
From the frontier town of Stroem
stad southeast of Oslo came reports
of German planes flying at great
height northward throughout last
night and today, presumably carry
ing troops and supplies to the Ger
man forces around Hamar and in
the Trondheim and Narvik areas to
the west and north.
AIR ATTACKS
Tonight's communique of the Nor
wegian high command told of at
tacks on Lillehammer by German
planes which bombed, strafed the
community with machine-gun fire,
and dropped pamphlets warning the
Norwegian people to cease then
resistance.
Information reaching neutral dip
lomats indicated that a major battle
between German and AlLied-Norwe
gian forces for possession of Trond
heim is developing, with b»th sides
strong in numbers and heavily
equipped with artillery as result of
the British landings in the north.
About 100 miles of cotton yarn
are required to make a typical
pneumatic truck tire.
