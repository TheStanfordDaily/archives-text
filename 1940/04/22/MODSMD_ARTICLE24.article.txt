# Capt. Tompkins To Show Films Of Hawaii Trip
## Lecturer to Present Movie of Sea Voyage For Tuesday Series 
### 
Captain Warwick M. Tumpkins,
who will be remembered for his pic
tures on Cape Horn which he pre
sented at Stanford last spring, will
return to the campus tomorrow to
show his colored film, "Hawaiian
Voyage," for the Tuesday Evening
Series at 7:30 o'clock in Memorial
Hall.
With a log book that records more
than 100.000 sea miles, Captain
Tompkins is today best known as a
master mariner and the owner of
the "Wander Bird." In 1935 the
schooner blazed across the North At
lantic to establish a record of 16 days
21 hours, faster than any other sail
ing ship of 100 feet had ever crossed
before.
Those who have never clearly un
derstood the difference between port
and starboard will enjoy the lecture,
however, for Captain Tompkins has
planned his pictures to appeal to a
general audience and not just to the
nautically minded.
"Hawaiian Voyage" is an exceed
ingly thorough camera study of life
at sea on a 5000-mile deep water
voyage with the Hawaiian Islands as
a turning point. Captain Tompkins
also includes shots of Hi!o and
Hawaii,
As a writer of sea stories, Captain
Tompkins has earned distinction and
in "Fifty South to Fifty South," pub
lished by W. W. Norton, he tells a
story unique in modern literature,
the record of the "Wander Bird's"
famous Cape Horn passage. The two
volumes on celestial navigation and
coastal plotting in the new Yachting
Encyclopedia are his work.
