| anything I cannot understand or
' cannot prove. Orthodoxy includes
God, soul, immortality, and an in

; these. My religion is a religion of
! humanity, here and now; it wel
comes interrogation, is tolerant, is
devoted to the welfare of mankind
I on this earth."
Dr. Trueblood: "I am forced to be
lieve in God as a spirit at the heart
of the universe with which man can
have communion, who is the father
and creator of our souls, in whom
we can find cosmic support and
companionship in all that we try to
do and sustenance in life's darkest
moments."
