# Allies Warn Italy Against Belligerence
## France Still Seeking Rapprochement With Italian Government 
### 
PARIS, April 21 (UP).—France
and Britain have informed Italy
they will not tolerate the slight
est change in the Mediterranean
status quo, including the Adriatic,
and that they could not continue
to recognize her as a non-belliger
ent if the Fascist state occupies any
part of Jugoslavia, even in the
guise of "preventative" or "protec
tive" occupation, a Foreign Oflice
informant said tonight.
(Ronald Cross, British Minister of
Economic Warfare, in a speech last
week demanded that Italy make her
position known and said that if Italy
"wanted to be treated as a neutral
she must act like one.")
FRENCH AMIABILITY
Premier Paul Reynaud told the
French Senate yesterday that France
has never received the slightest en
couragement from Italy to feelers in
Rome looking toward an amicable
agreement to settle the age-old
"Mediterranean problem." He said
such advances had been made by
France since the war began in Eu
rope as well as before.
In recent months the Italian gov
ernment has reiterated frequently
the continuation of the Rome-Berlin
axis and only last week announced
the exchange of German and Italian
military missions in all branches of
the armed forces in order to keep
the two military machines in close
touch.
ITALIANS HOSTILE
The Italian press recently has been
furiously hostile toward the Allies,
especially Great Britain, and public
speeches of Italian leaders—includ
ing one today by Giovanni Ansa'ldo,
sometimes mouthpiece for Foreign
Minister Galeazzo Ciano — have
warned the Italian people to be ready
to fight and have hinted that Italy
may enter the war soon.
The French, however, have not lost
all hope of a rapprochement with
Italy. Only today J. H. Ricard, for
mer Minister of Agriculture, left for
Milan as head of a French delega
tion representing export industries.
This delegation will make a serious
effort to strengthen good will through
inci'eased trade.
It was also announced officially
that France would participate in the
Milan trade fair as well as the Rome
1942 exposition, for which prepara
tions are still going forward in Italy
despite the threat of the international
situation.

The French, however, have not lost
all hope of a rapprochement with
Italy. Only today J. H. Ricard, for
mer Minister of Agriculture, left for
Milan as head of a French delega
tion representing export industries.
This delegation will make a serious
effort to strengthen good will through
inci'eased trade.
It was also announced officially
that France would participate in the
Milan trade fair as well as the Rome
1942 exposition, for which prepara
tions are still going forward in Italy
despite the threat of the international
situation.
PARIS, April 21 (UP).—France
and Britain have informed Italy
they will not tolerate the slight
est change in the Mediterranean
status quo, including the Adriatic,
and that they could not continue
to recognize her as a non-belliger
ent if the Fascist state occupies any
part of Jugoslavia, even in the
guise of "preventative" or "protec
tive" occupation, a Foreign Oflice
informant said tonight.
(Ronald Cross, British Minister of
Economic Warfare, in a speech last
week demanded that Italy make her
position known and said that if Italy
"wanted to be treated as a neutral
she must act like one.")
FRENCH AMIABILITY
Premier Paul Reynaud told the
French Senate yesterday that France
has never received the slightest en
couragement from Italy to feelers in
Rome looking toward an amicable
agreement to settle the age-old
"Mediterranean problem." He said
such advances had been made by
France since the war began in Eu
rope as well as before.
In recent months the Italian gov
ernment has reiterated frequently
the continuation of the Rome-Berlin
axis and only last week announced
the exchange of German and Italian
military missions in all branches of
the armed forces in order to keep
the two military machines in close
touch.
ITALIANS HOSTILE
The Italian press recently has been
furiously hostile toward the Allies,
especially Great Britain, and public
speeches of Italian leaders—includ
ing one today by Giovanni Ansa'ldo,
sometimes mouthpiece for Foreign
Minister Galeazzo Ciano — have
warned the Italian people to be ready
to fight and have hinted that Italy
may enter the war soon.
