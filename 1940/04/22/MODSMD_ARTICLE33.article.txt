# Stanford Nine Plays S.C. Today after Loss to Cal
## 
### 
Although Stanford's baseball club, shut out for the second time in a
row by southpaw Mike Koll, dropped a 6-0 contest to California at Berke
ley Saturday, the Indians bounce right back up again to take on U.S.C.'s
second-place Trojans in the Sunken Diamond at 3:30 o'clock today.
The Trojans, who were downed 11-0 by St. Mary's Gaels Friday night.

►-still have a slim mathematical
[ chance for a tie for the league title
; and will be pressing hard to takt
the Indians into camp to take ad
| vantage of that chance. The Cards
| on the other hand, would like noth
ing better than to ace the Trojanj
j out of the top spot and in so doing
; cop their only series win of the yeai
! as well. The two teams splii a pah
of games during spring vacation.
Stanford's record of ten losses at
against three wins has practically
cinched the cellar championship for
the Indians, but Coach Harry Wol
ter's boys are not figuring on going
down without a fight. If the men
| lrom Troy are too cocksure, an up
' set might be the result today.
CAL GETS 13 HITS
The game at Berkeley Saturday
was just a repetition oi what hap
pened the week before; only it was
worse from a Stanford point of
view. The Bears clubbed Quentin
"Cootie" Thompson for 13 safeties to
bring 6 tallies across the plate, while
the best the Indians could nick
Koll for were a pair of bingles, one
a double by Hal Costello and the
other a single by Monte Pfyl.
Although Thompson lanned six
California batters, the Bears gave
him a rough time ot it, especially in
the fifth and sixth cantos when they
scored four runs on five hits, and
two errors. At that, "Coot" struck
out three in those two innings.
CAL INFIELDERS STAR
Perry and Yockey, shortstop and
first sacker, respectively, were Cal's
offensive stars, each collecting three
safeties. And Koll helped win his
game by driving in a pair of runs.
