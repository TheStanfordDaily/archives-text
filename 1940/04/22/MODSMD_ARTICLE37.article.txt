# U.C. Defeats Frosh Nine, 3-1
## 
### 
One bad third inning robbed Stan
ford's freshman baseball team of
victory over California's frosh last
Saturday morning at Berkeley. In
that frame the Cubs scored two runs !
! from a single, three walks, and an
J error by Chucker Phil Wolf at home
plate that would have cut off a tally.
The final score was 3-1.
The Indians scored their lone run
in the fifth inning. Tommy Howard
I opened v/ith a sharp single and ad- j
vanced to second on Hanlon's fly. !
Clark Graham fanned for the sec- j
ond out, but Carl Kellenberger
rapped a single to score Howard
from second. Kellenberger was
caught off base to end the inning.
Stanford lost its last opportunity
to even the score in the eighth frame
j when Ray Hammett struck out and
Bill Cunha flied to the outfield with
the tying run on second. Kellcn- ;
berger led the frosh at the plate, se
curing two singles in two official
times at bat.
