# Gridders Prepare For Scrimmage
## 
### 
Entering the third week of spring
practice, the Indian gridders will
probably go through a scrimmage
either in tomorrow's open workout
or in the secret practice session
Wednesday.
Last Friday's drill followed the
usual pattern, with time about
evenly divided between working on
fundamentals and running through
plays. For the last 15 minutes the
squad put the foot back in football,
practicing punting and running
down under punts.
Norm Standlee again seems des
tined to do most of the Indians'
kicking. The Chief was booting
them out high and far. His boots
were over 60 yards consistently.
