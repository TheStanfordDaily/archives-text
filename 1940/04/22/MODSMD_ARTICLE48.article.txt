TWO weeks ago few college students in
America considered seriously the possibility
that the United States might be involved in the
European war. At least most of us felt reason
ably secure about the foreign situation. There
was none of that tense, almost fatalistic attitude
that prevailed last fall when Nazi legions goose
stepped into Poland, and Stanford students
came back to the Farm for what some thought
might be their last college year.
The war, gradually, over a period of weeks,
became Europe's war. The khaki-garbed fight
ers on some remote Continental front were
fighting Europe's battles—and the Yanks were
not coming. No, the Yanks were not coming.
But with the current course of fighting, with
Hitler's brilliant, lightning invasion of Norway
and Denmark, with the Allies dogged by the
fear of defeat—and with the increasing certainty
that Italy will enter on the side of the Axis
powers—the thought that America may be
come involved in the hostilities has become
more credible.
On Friday, with an unbelievable and some
what ironic sense of timing, college students
throughout the nation celebrated Peace Day.
The University of Chicago campus was lined
with white crosses, giving it a Flanders Field
appearance. Nearby signs were captioned,
"Will your name be here?"
At Cal the students —some of them at least—
struck for peace. Stanford, with its traditional
dislike for sensationalism, commemorated
Peace Day by attending, 1,300 strong, the show
ing of Erich Maria Remarque's biting "All Quiet
on the Western Front." Then it heard Dr. Wil
bur speak in Memorial Hall and listened to
two round-table discussions in the afternoon.
And wondered about war, with the gigantic
pari-mutuel of fate reducing the odds of our
escape, instant by instant.
And thought—"l don't want to fight."—D. H.
