# CAMPUS OPINION
## THE 						OTHER ANGLE 
### 
r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
In reply to the letter, signed M. J., published on
Thursday, I would like to ask M. J. on what facts, or
even evidence, he (or she) bases the statement that
Germany used all her assets and energies after the Ver
sailles Treaty in preparing munitions, etc., for more
"bloody excursions."
The territorial terms of the Treaty of Versailles
would not have been so bad had not the economic
terms been impossible to meet. The amount of repara
tions to be paid by Germany was not fixed at the time
Germany signed the treaty, but were to be determined
later, and in 1921 the Allied Governments demanded
56 billion dollars of Germany. Despite the advice of
economic experts that even if the payments were
spread over many years, the attempt to collect them
would dislocate the framework of international finance,
the victors were deaf to all such advice. Lloyd George
promised the British electorate in the elections of
1919 that he would "make the pips pay 'till they
squeaked." Needless to say, Germany could not pay
the 5G billion dollars, especially after all her colonies
and much of her resources had been confiscated and
taken by the Allies, and after the Mark had already
fallen to half its former value. Nevertheless, in the
first year of reparations Germany paid twice as much
as France paid (1 billion dollars) as her total repara
tions to Germany in four years after the Franco-Prus
sian War. At least Germany in 1871 didn't kill the
goose that was supposed to lay the golden eggs. Inci
dentally, the estimated value of the destruction to the
Allies by Germany in the War was 20 billion dollars.
The German nation, crippled by the strain of war,
the long blockade, the loss of valuable colonies, and
the surrender of her merchant marine, fell behind
in her payment of 730 million dollars in gold and
goods in 1922. Recognizing that. Germany had been
brought to the verge of a ruinous financial collapse,
the British govenment proposed a revision of the repa
rations terms; but France, lead by the intractable
Raymond Poincare, favored punitive treasures. I
quote:
If Germany will not pay up. the Treaty of Ver
sailles affords us a remedy. Article 248 gives the
Allies a priority of claim against all the property
and resources of the German Empire and the
German states.
Raymond Poincare, 1922
+ â™¦ * *
Germany in default, Poincare, in Jan
uary, 1923, ordered French troops to seize the Ruhr
Valley, the nerve center of German industry, and hold
it until payments were forthcoming. And we name
Germany the aggressor?
The catastrophic collapse of German credit followed.
The Mark fell faster than the printing presses could
operate, until notes for a billion marks were needed to
pay for a single meal. The only members of the bour
geoisie or commercial classes who survived were those
who owned foreign investments.
Belatedly realizing that the stabilization of Ger
man currency was necessary if she was to be expected
to pay any reparations, the Allies agreed to promote
an international loan to Germany to promote German
industry, and to temporarily reduce the reparations
payments, this plan being called the Dawes Plan. In
1929 the Young Plan took the place of the Dawes Plan.
Under this new arrangement Germany was to pay nine

billion dollars more in reparations, the payments to
eover a period of 59 years. Not until this pact had
been ratified in 1930 were the last troops of the Allied
Army of Occupation withdrawn from Germany.
Despite the suffering, the sacrifices, and the finan
cial debacle, the German people still possessed their
habits of industry and efficiency. Factories and ship
yards worked overtime to replace the goods and ships
surrendered to the Allies, and the frugal standards of
living in Germany enabled the manufacturers to pro
duce their wares more cheaply and gain foreign mar
kets despite discriminatory tariffs. By 1929, for the first
time in 15 years the value of Germany's exports sur
passed that of her imports, and the Germans had some
hope for the future. Then the Depression set in. For
eign loans to Germany ceased. Seeking national se
curity other countries raised their tariffs, cutting off
German commerce. Despite President Hoover's dec
laration of a one-year moratorium on all inter-govern
mental debts, German trade continued to decline.
Economic chaos again threatened Germany, and in the
elections of March, 1933, she resorted to the stringent
measures advocated by the National Socialists and
confirmed by an overwhelming majority President von
Hindenburg's appointment in the previous month of
Adolf Hitler to the Chancellorship.
I have only mentioned one of the many problems
that Germany had to meet somehow. She had tried to
meet them peacefully for 14 years, but she had recieved
little co-operation except from the United States. The
American public damns Hitler, all his policies, and all
his acts, but seems to forget, or never knew, just
what caused Germany, in the dark days of February
and March, 1933, to resort to National Socialists.
Yours truly,
Adams
