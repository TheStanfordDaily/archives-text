"AND STANFORD FOR lIER MEN"
A MES, lowa—We feel right at home here at lowa
State College. They have the quarter system, nine
sororities, twenty-four fraternities, and three men to
every woman. The boys give us the same old story:
women come to lowa to husband-hunt. The preda
tory female realizes she has a numerical advantage,
and she works it to the limit. Only the frosh are un
spoiled and free. The frosh arc always popular, and
then comes the sophomore slump.
But Stanford and lowa are not the only places
where men get an arithmetical raw deal. In fact, the
American educational system seems to be organized to
penalize the masculine sex. At Rice the tragic ratio
is three to one. At Alabama and Georgia the situation
is not much better. At Virginia, Princeton, and Harv
ard no women are allowed to enroll. And the boys
sing woeful ballads about "the rise of the town wait
ress, or the fall of the college boy." At South Bend,
St. Mary's Girls School supplies three hundred women
for Notre Dame's thousands. And all over the country
designing females are catered to by a preponderance
of male prospects.

IT IS almost inconceivable that marital bureaus are
permitted by the government. Universities fill the
need adequately, and the only possible use for non
collegiate mate-finding institutions is to fill the not
too-empty lives of enforced collegiate bachelors.
Even the Eastern girls' schools are in great de
mand, although college men must be alert to fill the
proper bill. The wife of a prominent Stanford alumnus
told us about the standards that Eastern girls' schools
set. If you are about to introduce an eligible young
man to an Eastern female, here is what you may ex
pect: A Wellesley girl will ask, "Does he have any
money?" A Bryn Mawr girl will ask, "Is he intelli
gent?" A Sweetbriar girl will ask, "Is he good look
ing?" And only a Smith girl will eagerly demand,
"Where the hell is he?" #
And so the story goes. Women are outnumbered;
men are overpowered. The girls set the standards, and
the men toe the mark.
That famous song about. "Stanford for her men"
just doesn't hold water at all. It should be, "A college
for a husband."
Industrialists may say what they wish about bar
gaining power and our pro-labor government. But
personally I am in favor of a self-protective Union for
University Men. We are being exploited by the law
of averages. "Solidarity forever; the Union makes us
strong."
