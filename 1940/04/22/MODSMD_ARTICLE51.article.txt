The tanks weren't shooting when they passed us.
An hour earlier there had been a scrimmage about
two miles up the line, and we had watched it. The
tanks had swept through that line, and were going on
by, now, about half a mile to the left of us.
We lay flat in the shell hole waiting for them to
pass, hoping they didn't see us. It was getting dark,
and a cloud of smoke drifting down from a big gun
about ten miles north of us made it hard for us to be
seen from the tanks.
They were clear by when Joe said, "Let's go."
We stood up and climbed out of the hole. We
headed out away from the tanks, half running over the
pock-marked ground. When I heard the sound of the
shell coming over, I dived for the first hole. I dug
my face in the ground, and waited until the explosion
was over.
When it was quiet again, I lifted my head. I
grabbed my gun in terror when I saw the man in
a German uniform there six feet from me in the
same shell hole.
He saw me a second later and raised his gun.
"Stop!" I shouted, and lowered my gun.
He dropped his gun to his hip, watching me
closely.
"I)o you speak English?" I asked him.
"Yes."
"That makes it easier," 1 said. I propped my
gun against the wall of dirt, and felt for a cig
arette.
He raised his gun.
"Hold," I said, "hold. You might shoot me."
"That's right. You guessed it the second time."
"No." I said. "That Mould get us nowhere at
all. Where's your army? Gone. Where's my army?
Gone. Now what good would it do you to kill me?"
He was sighting down the barrel of the gun.
"Or, what good would it do me to kill you? Per
sonally I think you are probably something of an ass,
but I don't sec why I should want to kill you, really,"
"Stand still." he said.
"Why do you seem so determined to kill me?"
"End the war," he said.
"Poppycock," I said.
"One guy less." he said. "If I let go, someone else
will have to shoot you. Maybe you'll shoot someone."
"Think of a blonde," I said.
He brought the gun down, pointing it at my stom
ach.
"That might lie fatal. Try the feet."
He aimed at mv right foot.
"A blonde for you. and a blonde for me. Ply
'em with liquor."
' I don't like blondes." he said, pulling the
trigger.

The tanks weren't shooting when they passed us.
An hour earlier there had been a scrimmage about
two miles up the line, and we had watched it. The
tanks had swept through that line, and were going on
by, now, about half a mile to the left of us.
We lay flat in the shell hole waiting for them to
pass, hoping they didn't see us. It was getting dark,
and a cloud of smoke drifting down from a big gun
about ten miles north of us made it hard for us to be
seen from the tanks.
They were clear by when Joe said, "Let's go."
We stood up and climbed out of the hole. We
headed out away from the tanks, half running over the
pock-marked ground. When I heard the sound of the
shell coming over, I dived for the first hole. I dug
my face in the ground, and waited until the explosion
was over.
When it was quiet again, I lifted my head. I
grabbed my gun in terror when I saw the man in
a German uniform there six feet from me in the
same shell hole.
He saw me a second later and raised his gun.
"Stop!" I shouted, and lowered my gun.
He dropped his gun to his hip, watching me
closely.
"I)o you speak English?" I asked him.
"Yes."
"That makes it easier," 1 said. I propped my
gun against the wall of dirt, and felt for a cig
arette.
He raised his gun.
"Hold," I said, "hold. You might shoot me."
"That's right. You guessed it the second time."
"No." I said. "That Mould get us nowhere at
all. Where's your army? Gone. Where's my army?
Gone. Now what good would it do you to kill me?"
He was sighting down the barrel of the gun.
"Or, what good would it do me to kill you? Per
sonally I think you are probably something of an ass,
but I don't sec why I should want to kill you, really,"
"Stand still." he said.
"Why do you seem so determined to kill me?"
"End the war," he said.
"Poppycock," I said.
"One guy less." he said. "If I let go, someone else
will have to shoot you. Maybe you'll shoot someone."
"Think of a blonde," I said.
He brought the gun down, pointing it at my stom
ach.
"That might lie fatal. Try the feet."
He aimed at mv right foot.
"A blonde for you. and a blonde for me. Ply
