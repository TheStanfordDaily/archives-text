# Sheridan Divorces Oomph For 'It All Came True'
## 
### 
"IT ALL CAME TRUE," now playing at the Fox Stanford.
Once upon a time, a Warner Brothers press agent had a startling
dream and a new word was added to the already bulging movie diction
ary—oomph. And with the new word came a new star—Ann Sheridan.
But the story does not have a happy ending until Miss Sheridan and her

newly acquired glamor were
vorced, and then "It All Came
True."
In this picturization of the novel
by Louis Bromfield, Ann Sheridan,
happily, becomes a real, convincing
New Yorker who is in love with her
childhood sweetheart and aspires
toward a singing career.
With all the build-up La Sheridan
has received, she had a full-time
job trying to live it down so the
audience would accept her as Sara
Jane and not as a hip-swinging
glamor girl. And this she does more
than satisfactorily. Only in one
scene does she turn on the glamor—
when she sings "Gaucho Serenade"
and it was in very poor taste.
JefTry Lynn gets better with every
picture and this is his best to date.
His sincere, intense style of acting
is a pleasant relief from the ma
jority of fist-swinging leading men.
Because his acting is pliable yet
smooth, he is always different and
exciting.
Back in his natural habitat after a
sojourn "South of the Border" in
"Virginia City," Humphrey Bogart
toughs his way through his role as
the gangster who plays "angel" to
Lynn's show.
The reason the picture is so good
is that in addition to good casting in
the starring roles, the smaller bits
and character are all of equally high
quality. They are executed with
sincerity and excellent technique,
and the director kept them just out
of the spotlight so that they will
not take too much from the stars.
Perhaps the best in the supporting
cast is former Abby Theater player
Una O'Connor, who plays Ann
Sheridan's fiery Irish mother. Zasu
Pitts gets her best chance in too
long, and Felix Bessart matches his
performance in "The Shop Around
the Corner," although it was not as
large.
If it can be arranged to miss the
rather insipid double feature, "Free,
Blonde and 21," this movie is worth
anyone's money and is guaranteed to
please all.—Sprager.
