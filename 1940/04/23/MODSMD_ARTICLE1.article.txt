But King Gustav and his diplomat I

For the corporation of Joe Stalin

people. If Sweden is to be carved
up Russia will not object strenu

was afraid it would not receive her

This time Germany was not play

as surprised as the rest of the world.

'INHERE is another minor item that

The Swedish army, not weak as their
Norwegian brothers proved to be,
but (500,000 fighting men, presented a
strong buffer. Finland proved that

Germany was not ready for an ex

expressed hearty disapproval.
As a result of cancellation of any
date with Sweden, Herr Hitler has
been faced with heavy going in
Norway.
His naval units, escorting his
troops into Norway, were slaugh
tered by the British fleet. German
warships, transports, and supply
ships were cut to ribbons by the
vastly superior Allied sea forces.
But he got there. Just how long
he can stay is the question.
Without transports, and with their
protecting fleet swept from the seas,
Hitler is having his troubles trans
porting soldiers to fight in Norway.
The Allied control of the west coast
prohibits the use of that area as a
dumping ground for the Reich army.
And the reported mining of the
Skagerrak by the British has made

his diplomatic sleeve. An ace
which he marked exactly for this
use. The German airfleet is trans
porting soldiers into Norway.
But while these planes are landing
a reported 2000 soldiers in Scandina
via each day, the airfleet has its
major disadvantages.
These planes can hardly transport
the heavier materiel of war. They
cannot carry large guns, nor the
motor equipment so essential in
these modern days of warfare. The
soldiers are reaching Norway, but
they will be fighting with sticks and
stones before long.
And so Hitler needs Sweden.
Needs if so that the remnants of
his carrying fleet can bear the
weapons needed for an extensive
campaign into Scandinavia through
Sweden. His route would be
through the Baltic, now a practic
ally free lane for German travel.
Der Fuehrer's ultimate object ad

blockade by the Scandinavian coun

|)UT Der Fuehrer has an ace up
his diplomatic sleeve. An ace
which he marked exactly for this
use. The German airfleet is trans
porting soldiers into Norway.
But while these planes are landing
a reported 2000 soldiers in Scandina
via each day, the airfleet has its
major disadvantages.
These planes can hardly transport
the heavier materiel of war. They
cannot carry large guns, nor the
motor equipment so essential in
these modern days of warfare. The
soldiers are reaching Norway, but
they will be fighting with sticks and
stones before long.
And so Hitler needs Sweden.
Needs if so that the remnants of
his carrying fleet can bear the
weapons needed for an extensive
campaign into Scandinavia through
Sweden. His route would be
through the Baltic, now a practic
ally free lane for German travel.
Der Fuehrer's ultimate object ad
mittedly is to break the Allied
blockade by the Scandinavian coun
tei thrust. Scandinavia is almost cer
tain to become the Belgium of World
War 11. The fjords and peninsulas
of Norway and Sweden may become
the Flanders Fields of this conflict.
Russia may prove turncoat. She
could keep Germany out. But at the
present she is buying swastikas . . .
not umbrellas.
