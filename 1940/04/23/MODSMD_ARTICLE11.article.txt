bur. the annual affair will this year be a reunion of the classes of 1914,
1915, 1916, 1917, and 1935.
One of the main issues to be decided at the meeting, however, will be

gestion for the change will be dis
cussed and decided upon by the
Alumni Assembly, composed of rep

tary, yesterday said, "If the Home
coming were held in the fall—say,
on Big Game week-end—it would
attract a much larger crowd for
the game, and make the Home
coming a three- or four-day
affair.

and all the other celebrations could
be enlarged and added to by various
alumni-student functions, and make
an even bigger week-end out of it."

that the "Old Timers" will not hold
its usual meeting on University Day
this year.
All members of this organization,
consisting of the members of the
classes Irom 1892 to 1906, inclusive,
however, are urged to attend the
regular alumni meeting held that
day.

version of a Homecoming. Featuring a talk by President Ray Lyman Wil
bur. the annual affair will this year be a reunion of the classes of 1914,
1915, 1916, 1917, and 1935.
One of the main issues to be decided at the meeting, however, will be

whether to keep Homecoming the 4
spring affair it now is, or change it
to a fall Homecoming Day. A sug
gestion for the change will be dis
cussed and decided upon by the
Alumni Assembly, composed of rep
resentatives from all classes and all
Stanford clubs and societies.
Pointing out the advantages of
the suggested change, Robert
"Bones" Hamilton, alumni secre
tary, yesterday said, "If the Home
coming were held in the fall—say,
on Big Game week-end—it would
attract a much larger crowd for
the game, and make the Home
coming a three- or four-day
affair.
"The Big Game Rally, the Gaieties,
and all the other celebrations could
be enlarged and added to by various
alumni-student functions, and make
an even bigger week-end out of it."
