# Bunn to Speak At Lunch Club
## Dean to Explain Need For Housemothers 
### 
Dean of Men John Bunn will
clarify his stand on the need of
house mothers for Stanford fraterni
ties tomorrow when he speaks be
fore the Luncheon Club. The meet
ing, open to the campus, is scheduled
for 12 o'clock in the Nitery.
"I believe that the average stu
dent does not understand my posi
tion in desiring house mothers for
the fraternities," avowed Dean
Bunn. The controversial issue will
be discussed thoroughly.
The problem was first presented by
Dean Bunn on April 2, when he
recommended the installation of
house mothers in the Annual Report
of the President. At that time Dean
Bunn stated that "a house mother
would tend to raise the level of our
fraternities and make them a real
asset to the University."
Virgil Hinshaw is chairman for to
morrow's luncheon. Dr. D. Elton
Trueblood is the faculty adviser.
Buffet luncheon is served for 25
cents.
