# High Court Gives Labor double Win
## Hetch Hetchy Power Distribution Contract Ruled Law Violation 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 22 (UP).
—Labor won two important vic
tories today when the Supreme
Court declared Alabama and Cali
fornia anti-picketing laws uncon
stitutional.
Both decision were written by Jus
tice Frank Murphy, newest member
of the court, with Justice James C.
Meßeynolds the lone dissenter in
both cases.
The court also ruled that San
Francisco's contract with the Pa
cific Gas and Electric Company for
distribution of Hetch Hetchy hydro
electric power is in violation of fed
eral law. The decision, ending 15
years of controversy over the city's
method of delivering power, makes
it necessary for San Francisco to
make new arrangements for power
distribution.
RAKER ACT VIOLATED
Secretary of Interior Harold Ickes,
commenting on the U. S. Supreme
Court decision outlawing sale of
Hetch Hetchy electric power by the
city of San Francisco to a private
utility, denied he had been actuated
by "purely punitive motives" against
San Francisco in seeking enforce
ment of the Raker Act.
The Supreme Court held that sale
of Hetch Hetchy power to the Pa
cific Gas and Electric Company vio
lated the Raker Act under which
the federal government granted
Hetch Hetchy resources to the city.
Ickes had pressed for a court deci
sion against this power sale, which
netted San Francisco about $2,000,000
annually.
STATE TRADE BARRIERS
In another important decision
touching on state trade barriers, the
court unanimously upheld validity
of a Pennsylvania statute restricting
transportation of automobiles by
truck trailei - . The Interstate Com
merce Commission had assailed the
law as a foundation for the erection
of further interstate trade bar
riers.
In the anti-picketing cases, the
court overruled state court deci
sions and set aside convictions of
two men.
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT
Murphy held that peaceful picket
ing is a means of disseminating in
formation "within that area of free
discussion that is guaranteed by the
constitution."
The American Federational of La
bor fought the Alabama law, while
the Congress of Industrial Organi
zations tested validity of a similar
law in Shasta County, Calif.
Attorneys for both unions held
that the laws violated constitutional
rights of free speech and free as
sembly, against arguments by the
states that the prohibition of picket
ing is a proper use of police power.

Court declared Alabama and Cali
fornia anti-picketing laws uncon
stitutional.
Both decision were written by Jus
tice Frank Murphy, newest member
of the court, with Justice James C.
Meßeynolds the lone dissenter in
both cases.
The court also ruled that San
Francisco's contract with the Pa
cific Gas and Electric Company for
distribution of Hetch Hetchy hydro
electric power is in violation of fed
eral law. The decision, ending 15
years of controversy over the city's
method of delivering power, makes
it necessary for San Francisco to
make new arrangements for power
distribution.
RAKER ACT VIOLATED
Secretary of Interior Harold Ickes,
commenting on the U. S. Supreme
Court decision outlawing sale of
Hetch Hetchy electric power by the
city of San Francisco to a private
utility, denied he had been actuated
by "purely punitive motives" against
San Francisco in seeking enforce
ment of the Raker Act.
The Supreme Court held that sale
of Hetch Hetchy power to the Pa
cific Gas and Electric Company vio
lated the Raker Act under which
the federal government granted
Hetch Hetchy resources to the city.
Ickes had pressed for a court deci
sion against this power sale, which
netted San Francisco about $2,000,000
annually.
STATE TRADE BARRIERS
In another important decision
touching on state trade barriers, the
court unanimously upheld validity
of a Pennsylvania statute restricting
transportation of automobiles by
truck trailei - . The Interstate Com
merce Commission had assailed the
law as a foundation for the erection
of further interstate trade bar
riers.
In the anti-picketing cases, the
court overruled state court deci
sions and set aside convictions of
two men.
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT
Murphy held that peaceful picket
ing is a means of disseminating in
formation "within that area of free
discussion that is guaranteed by the
constitution."
The American Federational of La
bor fought the Alabama law, while
the Congress of Industrial Organi
zations tested validity of a similar
law in Shasta County, Calif.
Attorneys for both unions held
that the laws violated constitutional
rights of free speech and free as
sembly, against arguments by the
states that the prohibition of picket
ing is a proper use of police power.
