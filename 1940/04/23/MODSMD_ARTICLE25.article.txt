picked a field and we came down."
Thus matter-of-factly Gioria ex
plained how they happened to smash
all regulations and land on the navy
Hying field at Mare Island.

In answer to the possibility of red

silly. I don't see what there is to
have any investigation about. We
just picked a field and landed."
