# Hungarian journalist Covers U.S. While Enrolled at Farm

### JEAN NOWELL 
The various American news agencies, A.P., U.P., 1.N.5., and the rest,
may need thousands of men on their European staffs, hut the newspaper,
Pesta-Lloyd, in Budapest needs just one correspondent to cover all the
sporting, society, and cultural aspects of the United States.
J hat man is Prince I'ran/ Joseph Hohenlohe: and. despite the magni-

tude of his job. he has registered at,
Stanford to pick up a few pointers
on English inflection and emphasis.
For all normal purposes, however,
Hohenlohe speaks English, not
American, and speaks it well. He
also ticks off Hungarian, Spanish,
French, and German.
COSMOPOLITAN DEFINED
The vague word "cosmopolitan," if
you define it as meaning "at home
in any country," really applies to
this newspaperman. Born in Vienna
23 years ago, he was sent first to the
College de Normandie in France,

where lie studied for about seven
years. He then entered Magdelene
College at. Oxford. Officially his
home is in Budapest.
In thinking back over his years
at the College de Normandie, one
1 hilarious story concerning an
American movie actress came to
mind. It seems that at the age of
13 or thereabouts, he wrote a fan
letter to Carole Lombard asking for
an autographed picture. Weeks later
he received a letter from a school
boy in Michigan asking in turn for
his autograph.
CLIPPING STARTLES
Enclosed in the letter was a dip
ping from an American newspaper
carrying this somewhat startling bit
of information—"Glamorous Hun
| garian prince seeks hand of Carole
Lombard." The 13-year-old was still
( a little dazed when he finally re
ceived the customary autographed
; "glossy" of La Lombard.
The mention of Einstein brought
i up story Hohenlohe swears is
true, because he was there. It con
cerns the great man and an English
actress who shall be nameless and
I who was certainly brainless. She
was introduced to Professor Einstein
at a party given by Max Reinhardt.
Beaming, she held out her hand
and burbled, "Oh. Professor Ein
stein, I've heard so much about you.
I And what are you doing now—work
ing on a new relativity theory?"
A Stanford man standing nearby
j then brought the inevitable what
i do - you - think-of-Stanford-women
! query.
"I think they're damn' charming,"
i he said. A look of complete amaze
ment spread over ihe questioner's
face. Hohenlohe enlarged on his
statement:
"You should see the grimly intel
lectual blue-stocking at Oxford.
Your women aren't in hot pursuit of
a career. Most of them are here to
get married; and they have sense
enough to be—well—charming."
