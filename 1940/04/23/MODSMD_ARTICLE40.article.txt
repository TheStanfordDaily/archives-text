# Card Nine Heat Trojans 8 to 7; Wolter Uses Four Moundmen
## 
### DON SELBY 
Ili-ally whackiny; th«> horsehide for the first time since spring vacation,
the Stanford baseballcrs took, the U.S.C. Trojans down the line to the
tune of 8 to 7 yesterday afternoon in the Sunken Diamond.
lhi' Card' win. which gave them their only series victory of the season,
knocked Troy out of any chance whatever for the league baseball chain-

about the only conference
| crown that Trojan athletes have not
j annexed.
The Indians pounded two Trojan
pitchers, Wilkins and Leif, for 11
hits, while the best that the S.C. bat
ters could collect was six safeties
from the array of Card hurlers that
i Coach Harry Wolters sent to the
; mound. Claude Purkitt, Russ Smith,
| Bill Masters, and ''Cootie" Thomp
! son each took his turn on the hill.
BOBBLES AID TROY
Alec Cereghino almost played the
role of the goat by dropping two Hies
early in the game, both bobbles giv
, ing the Trojans unearned runs. But
j the little Italian center fielder came
back with flying colot to emerge
a hero when he collected three bin
glcs in four official trips to the plate.
Pat Magano, playing in his first
league contest in right field, also
J turned in an outstanding game.
Each team pushed one tally across
the plate in the first inning, and the
j men from Troy started the second
frame as if they intended to make a
rout of the game, scoring twice on a
triple by Murdock and a home run
by Holley. But the Cards had a trick
or two up their sleeves also.
They scored four runs on three
hits, tallying in the following man
ner: Nagano walked; Dick Shortall
singled to left field, advancing Na
| gano to second: Jack Randall beat
j out an infield hit; and Purkitt got
| life on a fielder's choice, forcing Na
gano at home plate.
With the bags loaded, Cereghino
tripled, driving in Shortall, Randall,
I and Purkitt, then scored himself on
j Wilkins' error on Monte Pfyl's bunt.
With Ike Boone and Pfyl on the
bases. Norm Juney hit into a double
play to end the inning.
EARLY TROJAN LEAD
The Trojans went into a 0-4 lead
in the fourth inning when they
j picked inning when they picked up
three runs on two hits and two
j errors. Murdock, first sacker, got
, life on Pfyl's error, and Wilkins got
three bases on Cereghino's error on
| his fly ball, scoring Murdock.
i When Barnes singled to drive in
j Wilkins, Wolters replaced Purkitt,
who pitched good ball for three and
| two-thirds innings, with Russ Smith
j in order that his southpaw flinger
; might face Troy's left-handed bat
ters who were next in the batting
order. But the first left-hander,
Combs, walked, and the second, Ko
nopka, singled to drive in Barnes
| with the third tally of the inning,
i Koski flied out to Juney to end the
I frame.
However, the Cards were really
hot at the plate yesterday, and they
| added three runs on three hits in
| the fifth canto to end their scoring
for the day. Masters got credit for
the win, giving up nary a hingle
| in the two innings he worked.
Thompson pitched the last two
frames and also shut out the men
j from Troy. Stanford plays Cal here
I Saturday.

back with flying colot to emerge
a hero when he collected three bin

Each team pushed one tally across
the plate in the first inning, and the
j men from Troy started the second

rout of the game, scoring twice on a
triple by Murdock and a home run
by Holley. But the Cards had a trick
or two up their sleeves also.
They scored four runs on three
hits, tallying in the following man
ner: Nagano walked; Dick Shortall
singled to left field, advancing Na
| gano to second: Jack Randall beat
j out an infield hit; and Purkitt got
| life on a fielder's choice, forcing Na
gano at home plate.
With the bags loaded, Cereghino

lhi' Card' win. which gave them their only series victory of the season,
knocked Troy out of any chance whatever for the league baseball chain-

about the only conference

j annexed.
The Indians pounded two Trojan
pitchers, Wilkins and Leif, for 11
hits, while the best that the S.C. bat
ters could collect was six safeties
from the array of Card hurlers that
i Coach Harry Wolters sent to the
; mound. Claude Purkitt, Russ Smith,
| Bill Masters, and ''Cootie" Thomp
! son each took his turn on the hill.
BOBBLES AID TROY
Alec Cereghino almost played the
role of the goat by dropping two Hies
early in the game, both bobbles giv
, ing the Trojans unearned runs. But
j the little Italian center fielder came
back with flying colot to emerge
a hero when he collected three bin
glcs in four official trips to the plate.
Pat Magano, playing in his first
league contest in right field, also
J turned in an outstanding game.
Each team pushed one tally across
the plate in the first inning, and the
j men from Troy started the second
frame as if they intended to make a
rout of the game, scoring twice on a
triple by Murdock and a home run
by Holley. But the Cards had a trick
or two up their sleeves also.
They scored four runs on three
hits, tallying in the following man
ner: Nagano walked; Dick Shortall
singled to left field, advancing Na
| gano to second: Jack Randall beat
j out an infield hit; and Purkitt got
| life on a fielder's choice, forcing Na
gano at home plate.
With the bags loaded, Cereghino
tripled, driving in Shortall, Randall,
I and Purkitt, then scored himself on
j Wilkins' error on Monte Pfyl's bunt.
With Ike Boone and Pfyl on the
bases. Norm Juney hit into a double
play to end the inning.
EARLY TROJAN LEAD
The Trojans went into a 0-4 lead
in the fourth inning when they
j picked inning when they picked up
three runs on two hits and two
j errors. Murdock, first sacker, got
, life on Pfyl's error, and Wilkins got
three bases on Cereghino's error on
| his fly ball, scoring Murdock.
i When Barnes singled to drive in
j Wilkins, Wolters replaced Purkitt,
who pitched good ball for three and
| two-thirds innings, with Russ Smith
j in order that his southpaw flinger
; might face Troy's left-handed bat
ters who were next in the batting
order. But the first left-hander,
Combs, walked, and the second, Ko
nopka, singled to drive in Barnes
| with the third tally of the inning,
i Koski flied out to Juney to end the
I frame.
However, the Cards were really
hot at the plate yesterday, and they
| added three runs on three hits in
| the fifth canto to end their scoring
for the day. Masters got credit for
the win, giving up nary a hingle
| in the two innings he worked.
Thompson pitched the last two
frames and also shut out the men
j from Troy. Stanford plays Cal here
