Stanford thoroughly scouted the
Trojans and Bears Saturday in their
dual meet at Edwards Field in Ber
keley. Bill Ellington was in the
press box clocking second and third
place men, while some 30 Card
trackmen were sizing up and noting
the performances of the men of both
s.quads with whom they'll have to
contend in the next two weeks.
*!« * *
SECOND AND THIRD places are
going to be counted upon heavily
this week-end in the Big Meet in
our Stadium. Southern California
collected 10 outright first places, one
tie. and the relay as a gift and yet
was fortunate to eke out a 72' 2 to
58'2 hollow triumph.
Potentially the Indians have Ift
first places to count on against
these same Bears, including the
mile relay combination which our
own private dope sheet has fig
ured out to decide the meet. The
score before the relay is going to
he: Stanford 65. California 01.
A few unexpected showings by
either Bear or Indian runners or
field men, of course, might turn the
meet into a narrow Bear victory or
a lop-sided Indian win. The Satur
day morning dope sheets had the
Bears losing anywhere from 15 to
25 points, but in the end it took the
low hurdles to decide the affair—the
event before the relay.

COMPARING TROY'S SHOWING
Saturday with Stanford's "bests" of
recent date. Dean Cromwell's boys
would have been lucky to have got
ten by Bill Ellington's squad.
Running true to the form of
previous years. Cromwell's lads
didn't look too good in any events
except the high jump, javelin
throw, and high hurdles. It's al
ways the same year after year. In
their first meet or meets the Tro
jans look like an ordinary country
team, hut the situation is reversed
when the Stanford - U.S.C. meet
comes around.
So where Stanford could have
won Saturday (by a dope sheet),
it'll be an entirely different situa-

I tion, May 4, in Los Angeles' Coli
j seum. Then is when second and
! third places will be cut to a fine
j point.
* * *
MICKEY ANDERSON WON both
! sprints in only mediocre times. Right
, now Ken Battaglia can take seconds
J iti both races to Clyde Jeffrey, but
I Mickey comes along notoriously
i slow and will probably be favored
i tor second place.
Sid Hayes and I)ick Simpson
are the classiest hurdlers in these
parts, but down in L.A. Hcmmcll,
Bledsoe, and Biewener will have
improved and make it darn tough,
Charley Shaw and Craig William
son are both running around 47.4 in
the 440, but the way Howard Upton
| stepped oat in that race Saturday in
[47.7 made us realize that it's going
to be tough beating that veieran.
The way Troy's Louie Zampe
rini looked against Cal would
make the amateurs think that by
May 4 he won't have come far
enough to heat Paul Moore, but
we know better. That'll be a tough
one and the race probably won't be
decided until the last stretch kick.

ALREADY CAL BOOSTERS are
pointing toward 1941, when the
! greatest quarter-miler in the coun
try will make his debut. Grover
| Klemmer, the sensational freshman
1 who is giving lessons on how to run
i the quarter to his varsity friends, ran
47 fiat Saturday morning. •
One Cal supporter made the re
mark that Stanford's :i: 10.5 in the
mile relay would he in danger
next year by a Cal team with
Klemmer anchoring it.
They may come close but they
won't do il.'our guess is. The Bears
ran 3:l. r > Saturday, although dis
qualified, arid they haven't got three
potential 47.5 runners as tSanford has
| this ye:.r. And again my guess is
! that in the Fresno Relays the world
' mark will be lowered to 3:10 flat or
' better bv Stanford.
Yah, ya, you can't catch Stanford.

Saturday with Stanford's "bests" of
recent date. Dean Cromwell's boys
would have been lucky to have got
ten by Bill Ellington's squad.
Running true to the form of
previous years. Cromwell's lads
didn't look too good in any events
except the high jump, javelin
throw, and high hurdles. It's al
ways the same year after year. In
their first meet or meets the Tro
jans look like an ordinary country
team, hut the situation is reversed
when the Stanford - U.S.C. meet
comes around.
So where Stanford could have
won Saturday (by a dope sheet),
it'll be an entirely different situa-

I tion, May 4, in Los Angeles' Coli
j seum. Then is when second and
! third places will be cut to a fine
j point.

MICKEY ANDERSON WON both
! sprints in only mediocre times. Right
, now Ken Battaglia can take seconds
J iti both races to Clyde Jeffrey, but
I Mickey comes along notoriously
i slow and will probably be favored
i tor second place.
Sid Hayes and I)ick Simpson
are the classiest hurdlers in these
parts, but down in L.A. Hcmmcll,
Bledsoe, and Biewener will have
improved and make it darn tough,
Charley Shaw and Craig William
son are both running around 47.4 in
the 440, but the way Howard Upton
| stepped oat in that race Saturday in
[47.7 made us realize that it's going
to be tough beating that veieran.
The way Troy's Louie Zampe
rini looked against Cal would
make the amateurs think that by
May 4 he won't have come far
enough to heat Paul Moore, but
we know better. That'll be a tough
one and the race probably won't be
decided until the last stretch kick.

ALREADY CAL BOOSTERS are
pointing toward 1941, when the

try will make his debut. Grover

1 who is giving lessons on how to run
i the quarter to his varsity friends, ran
47 fiat Saturday morning. •
One Cal supporter made the re
mark that Stanford's :i: 10.5 in the
mile relay would he in danger
next year by a Cal team with
Klemmer anchoring it.
They may come close but they
won't do il.'our guess is. The Bears
ran 3:l. r > Saturday, although dis
qualified, arid they haven't got three
potential 47.5 runners as tSanford has
| this ye:.r. And again my guess is
! that in the Fresno Relays the world
' mark will be lowered to 3:10 flat or
' better bv Stanford.
Yah, ya, you can't catch Stanford.
There are more automobiles than
' telephones in the United States.
Stanford thoroughly scouted the
Trojans and Bears Saturday in their
dual meet at Edwards Field in Ber
keley. Bill Ellington was in the
press box clocking second and third
place men, while some 30 Card
trackmen were sizing up and noting
the performances of the men of both
s.quads with whom they'll have to
contend in the next two weeks.

SECOND AND THIRD places are
going to be counted upon heavily
this week-end in the Big Meet in
our Stadium. Southern California
collected 10 outright first places, one
tie. and the relay as a gift and yet
was fortunate to eke out a 72' 2 to
58'2 hollow triumph.
Potentially the Indians have Ift
first places to count on against
these same Bears, including the
mile relay combination which our
own private dope sheet has fig
ured out to decide the meet. The
score before the relay is going to
he: Stanford 65. California 01.
A few unexpected showings by
either Bear or Indian runners or
field men, of course, might turn the
meet into a narrow Bear victory or
a lop-sided Indian win. The Satur
day morning dope sheets had the
Bears losing anywhere from 15 to
25 points, but in the end it took the
low hurdles to decide the affair—the

[47.7 made us realize that it's going
to be tough beating that veieran.
The way Troy's Louie Zampe
rini looked against Cal would
make the amateurs think that by
May 4 he won't have come far
enough to heat Paul Moore, but
we know better. That'll be a tough
one and the race probably won't be
decided until the last stretch kick.

ALREADY CAL BOOSTERS are

i the quarter to his varsity friends, ran
47 fiat Saturday morning. •
One Cal supporter made the re
mark that Stanford's :i: 10.5 in the
mile relay would he in danger
next year by a Cal team with
Klemmer anchoring it.
They may come close but they
won't do il.'our guess is. The Bears
ran 3:l. r > Saturday, although dis
qualified, arid they haven't got three
potential 47.5 runners as tSanford has
| this ye:.r. And again my guess is
! that in the Fresno Relays the world
' mark will be lowered to 3:10 flat or
' better bv Stanford.
Yah, ya, you can't catch Stanford.
There are more automobiles than
' telephones in the United States.
Stanford thoroughly scouted the
Trojans and Bears Saturday in their
dual meet at Edwards Field in Ber
keley. Bill Ellington was in the
press box clocking second and third
place men, while some 30 Card
trackmen were sizing up and noting
the performances of the men of both
s.quads with whom they'll have to
contend in the next two weeks.

SECOND AND THIRD places are
going to be counted upon heavily
this week-end in the Big Meet in
our Stadium. Southern California
collected 10 outright first places, one
tie. and the relay as a gift and yet
was fortunate to eke out a 72' 2 to
58'2 hollow triumph.
Potentially the Indians have Ift
first places to count on against
these same Bears, including the
mile relay combination which our
own private dope sheet has fig
ured out to decide the meet. The
score before the relay is going to
he: Stanford 65. California 01.
A few unexpected showings by
either Bear or Indian runners or
field men, of course, might turn the
meet into a narrow Bear victory or
a lop-sided Indian win. The Satur
day morning dope sheets had the
Bears losing anywhere from 15 to
25 points, but in the end it took the
low hurdles to decide the affair—the
event before the relay.

COMPARING TROY'S SHOWING
Saturday with Stanford's "bests" of
recent date. Dean Cromwell's boys
would have been lucky to have got
ten by Bill Ellington's squad.
Running true to the form of
previous years. Cromwell's lads
didn't look too good in any events
except the high jump, javelin
throw, and high hurdles. It's al
ways the same year after year. In
their first meet or meets the Tro
jans look like an ordinary country
team, hut the situation is reversed
when the Stanford - U.S.C. meet
comes around.
So where Stanford could have
won Saturday (by a dope sheet),
it'll be an entirely different situa-

I tion, May 4, in Los Angeles' Coli
j seum. Then is when second and
! third places will be cut to a fine
j point.
