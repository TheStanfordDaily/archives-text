# Girard Out of Track Meet; Hayes, Brown Back on Team
## 
### 
Mars ton "Mushy" Girard. according to Coach Bill Ellington, will defi
nitely not be ahle to compete against California in the annual dual meet
this coming Saturday, news which cuts a little thinner Stanford's expected
margin of victory.
Though Mush's leg doesn't bother him now. Coach Bill Ellington has
decided not to take the chance of tampering with the muscle cramp which

Girard last Thursday. This means
I that the Cards may drop a possible ti
! to 8 points for Ellington would have
j entered him in both his favorite, the
mile, and the half-mil? as well.
CRIPPLES RETURN
Girard's loss is balanced by the
return of some of the more chronic
Indian cripples. They are hurdler
I Sid Hayes and broad jumper Ray
Brown. Last year at this time Sid
I pulled a muscle during one of Dink
Templeton's classical mid-week time
trials and was out of the Big Meet.
However, this year Sid is just on
the mend from a bad ankle and with
a week to whip into shape ought to
be able to grab off a couple of places
against the Bear hurdling talent that
was shown in the U.S.C. meet last
Saturday.
BROAD JUMP CHANCE
Ray Brown's college career has
been plagued by a series of injuries
and decisions to change his form.
As a result of these difficulties, Ray
has never, as a varsity competitor,
reached the mark of 24 feet 6 inches
he accomplished as a frosh. Yet Ray
beat any jumps the Bears had to
i offer during the inaugural Cal-Stan
ford relays and has the stuff to re
i peat this performance.
Interested observers were Elling
ton and his team at the S.C.-Cal
meet last Saturday. Stan Andersen
and Coach Ellington sat in the press
box timing every second and third
place runner in an effort to get a
good idea of the strength of the re
! spective teams.
The main conclusions that can be
drawn from Saturday's meet are that
Cal is definitely stronger than was
expected and that, although the Tro
jans may be as strong as ever, they
j certainly are not yet in the best of
shape.
