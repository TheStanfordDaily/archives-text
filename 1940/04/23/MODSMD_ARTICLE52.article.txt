# Unmasking the Masque
## 
### 
BEFORE the Masque Ball committee gets too
far along in its preparations for this year's
dance, it might be well for Ex Committee to
consider the fact that this particular part of
the Convalescent Home Drive is nothing but a
farce, as aged and as uninspiring as one of Joe
Miller's oldest gags.
For the most part the events of the Con Home
week are spontaneous. We work and play and
eat beans as much for the genuine enjoyment
we get out of it as we do for the good of our
one pet project. But the Masque Ball lost both
its healthy appeal and its ability to return a
profit when the famous King-Queen contest
was abandoned.
To those of you who have never heard of the
King-Queen contest, it was a mixture of vote
selling, sabotage, and baby-kissing. Congress
man Dies would have flayed it in all the
newspapers of the country as un-American.
But it was said to have been fun, and the Con
Home kids got the profits.
Regardless of the good or bad of the King-
Queen era, the past four Masque Balls have
not had any monarchs. In fact, they have had
nothing. The only thing of note about the new
Masque Balls is that they have more tickets
unsold than all the rest of the campus dances
combined. Shep Fields would draw a better
crowd, which is an insult to any self-respecting
campus celebration.
Some form of entertainment with sex appeal,
of course, must be put forward to supplant the
succumbing Masquers farce. Someone has
suggested a work clothes tussle, still another
idea-monger would like to see an open-air
dance, to be held on the tennis courts or on
portable platforms such as the ones Dr. Wilbur
furnishes for the freshman receptions every
year.
Anything, even Mr. Fields' drizzling rhythm,
would be an improvement.
