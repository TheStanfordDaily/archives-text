# CAMPUS OPINION
## NOT SAFE YET? 
### 
EDITOR, SIR:
Every year about this time the question of ade
quate fire protection and safety devices for Encina Hall
crops up. Last year, as before, The Daily ran quite
an effective editorial describing a burning Encina
Hall—an editorial which, no doubt, set many people
to thinking about this problem, but the matter was
soon forgotten. This year, after some agitation on the
part of Fire Chief Dugan and The Stanford Daily, the
University took steps to quiet some of this annual
discussion by spending some $1500 to install three new
escapes. Now the question is: Arc these new fire es
capes adequate?
It is probably safe to say that one of the major
dangers—that of the danger to the residents of the
Bull Pen—has been removed by the excellent system
of escapes to the Commons kitchen roof. However, I
fail to see how and why the new escapes on the ends
of the building are a great deal better than those
which have been on the building for many years.
In the first place, as has been pointed out many
times, Encina is built largely of wood—wood that
has been pretty thoroughly dried in 40-odd years.
Were a fire to start on one of the lower floors, any of
the three stair wells or ventilating shafts would make
excellent flues. Were a fire to start in the vicinity of
one of these wells, a large section of the hall would be
cut off from escape, and one end escape rendered use
less. Thus would mean that the residents of the fifth,
fourth, and third floor rooms would be forced to use
one escape, since the Bull Pen ladders would probably
also be cut off. All those living on these three top
floors would descend by one ladder INTO A CORNER
SECOND FLOOR ROOM BACK INTO THE BUILD
ING and then pass out the door of the room back
into the hall, finally to climb through the hall window
(along with all the residents of the second floor) to
final safety on the Commons roof. It doesn't take a
great deal of imagination to picture the results of this
condition.
What should be done? I do not consider myself
an authority on fire escapes, but it seems fairly ob
vious that Encina is not yet adequately protected
against disaster. It has occurred to the writer that
the following suggestions might he in order: First, the
new escapes should have drop ladders to the ground

instead of ending at the window of a second floor
room, thereby forcing upper floor residents back into
the building and out through the small hall window.
Secondly, ladders should be placed at each end of the
main hall, that is, above the cellar doors, or even on the
front of the building. Thirdly, the alarm system in
the hall itself should be connected directly with the
fire house, so that any alarm turned in in the hall
would summon the engines.
The University has no excuse for the conditions
which exist in Encina, and no one will doubt that the
hall is still a danger and a menace. Perhaps if the
University still refuses to do anything really effective
about these conditions, the best way to handle the
situation would be to contact the parents of the hall's
residents. The protests that would follow would no
doubt be a much stronger method of bringing this
problem to the attention of the proper authorities than
a letter to the editor of The Stanford Daily.

EDITOR, SIR:
Every year about this time the question of ade
quate fire protection and safety devices for Encina Hall
crops up. Last year, as before, The Daily ran quite
an effective editorial describing a burning Encina
Hall—an editorial which, no doubt, set many people
to thinking about this problem, but the matter was
soon forgotten. This year, after some agitation on the
part of Fire Chief Dugan and The Stanford Daily, the
University took steps to quiet some of this annual
discussion by spending some $1500 to install three new
escapes. Now the question is: Arc these new fire es
capes adequate?
It is probably safe to say that one of the major
dangers—that of the danger to the residents of the
Bull Pen—has been removed by the excellent system
of escapes to the Commons kitchen roof. However, I
fail to see how and why the new escapes on the ends
of the building are a great deal better than those
which have been on the building for many years.
In the first place, as has been pointed out many
times, Encina is built largely of wood—wood that
has been pretty thoroughly dried in 40-odd years.
Were a fire to start on one of the lower floors, any of
the three stair wells or ventilating shafts would make
excellent flues. Were a fire to start in the vicinity of
one of these wells, a large section of the hall would be
cut off from escape, and one end escape rendered use
less. Thus would mean that the residents of the fifth,
fourth, and third floor rooms would be forced to use
one escape, since the Bull Pen ladders would probably
also be cut off. All those living on these three top
floors would descend by one ladder INTO A CORNER
SECOND FLOOR ROOM BACK INTO THE BUILD
ING and then pass out the door of the room back
into the hall, finally to climb through the hall window
(along with all the residents of the second floor) to
final safety on the Commons roof. It doesn't take a
great deal of imagination to picture the results of this
condition.
What should be done? I do not consider myself
an authority on fire escapes, but it seems fairly ob
vious that Encina is not yet adequately protected
against disaster. It has occurred to the writer that
the following suggestions might he in order: First, the
new escapes should have drop ladders to the ground

instead of ending at the window of a second floor
room, thereby forcing upper floor residents back into
the building and out through the small hall window.
Secondly, ladders should be placed at each end of the
main hall, that is, above the cellar doors, or even on the
front of the building. Thirdly, the alarm system in
the hall itself should be connected directly with the
fire house, so that any alarm turned in in the hall
would summon the engines.
The University has no excuse for the conditions
which exist in Encina, and no one will doubt that the
hall is still a danger and a menace. Perhaps if the
University still refuses to do anything really effective
about these conditions, the best way to handle the
situation would be to contact the parents of the hall's
residents. The protests that would follow would no
doubt be a much stronger method of bringing this
problem to the attention of the proper authorities than
a letter to the editor of The Stanford Daily.
Very truly yours,
