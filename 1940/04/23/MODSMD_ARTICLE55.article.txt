# AFTER NINE THOUSAND MILES
## 
### 
I was 10, the boy who lived next door and I
used to have heated debates over the relative
merits of Stanford and California. In those debates
I was not only sure that Stanford was superior to Cal
in every respect—a position still reasonably defensible
—but I was also sure that Stanford was superior to
every other university in every respect. (Rally Com
mittee should have gotten me then, when I was young
and plastic.)
Since then, of course, I have learned about the
many ways in which many universities surpass the
Stanford Red: Harvard for its scholastic reputation,
Columbia for its graduate schools, U.S.C. for its five
football teams per season, and so on. And visiting 18
universities has further humbled my Cardinal pride.
In a variety of specific and general ways—ranging from
buildings and bowling alleys to cultural features —at
least half of the universities we visited could claim
superiority of our Alma Mater in one or more respects.
If over-dosed with school spii'it we might not admit it.
But after a bad Saturday afternoon in the football
season, it would all be pretty obvious.
* * # *
B" T exposed as I was to all these insidious, Berke
ley-like influences, I am still coming home a loyal
Stanford man—still convinced that in an all-features
average Stanford is as good as any school in the coun
try. This may sound like a strained phrase to please
local appetites and the remnants of my 10-year-old
pride. But actually it is an opinion arrived at without
the aid of a Big Game Rally or the Stanford Band.
Despite Stanford's car-aristocracy (of which my
Model-A makes me only a fifth of a member) and
despite the caucus system, Stanford comes closer to
informality and democracy than most of the big East
ern schools. From all we could gather, Stanford's fac
ulty is among the best. And in an individualistic way
our campus has as much appeal as the Jeffersonian
architecture of Virginia, the Gothic wonders of Prince
ton, or the tradition-beautiful buildings of Harvard.
Some popular psychologist said that if a man is
really in love with his wife seeing many beautiful wom
en only makes him homesick. I can't say that the col
lege situation is entirely analagous.
Our trip did not make us homesick, if for no other
reason than that we were comforted by the thought of
our Stanford friends working—or at least worrying.
"Six o'clock." we would say in New York. "They're
still in the lab."
But in 9,000 miles we haven't changed our minds
about preferring Stanford. And unless that psychol
ogist is awfully right, that may be more than one
could have said for a wife.

I was not only sure that Stanford was superior to Cal
in every respect—a position still reasonably defensible
—but I was also sure that Stanford was superior to
every other university in every respect. (Rally Com
mittee should have gotten me then, when I was young
and plastic.)
Since then, of course, I have learned about the
many ways in which many universities surpass the
Stanford Red: Harvard for its scholastic reputation,
Columbia for its graduate schools, U.S.C. for its five
football teams per season, and so on. And visiting 18
universities has further humbled my Cardinal pride.
In a variety of specific and general ways—ranging from
buildings and bowling alleys to cultural features —at
least half of the universities we visited could claim
superiority of our Alma Mater in one or more respects.
If over-dosed with school spii'it we might not admit it.
But after a bad Saturday afternoon in the football
season, it would all be pretty obvious.

B" T exposed as I was to all these insidious, Berke
ley-like influences, I am still coming home a loyal
Stanford man—still convinced that in an all-features
average Stanford is as good as any school in the coun
try. This may sound like a strained phrase to please
local appetites and the remnants of my 10-year-old
pride. But actually it is an opinion arrived at without
the aid of a Big Game Rally or the Stanford Band.
Despite Stanford's car-aristocracy (of which my
Model-A makes me only a fifth of a member) and
despite the caucus system, Stanford comes closer to
informality and democracy than most of the big East
ern schools. From all we could gather, Stanford's fac
ulty is among the best. And in an individualistic way
our campus has as much appeal as the Jeffersonian
architecture of Virginia, the Gothic wonders of Prince
ton, or the tradition-beautiful buildings of Harvard.
Some popular psychologist said that if a man is
really in love with his wife seeing many beautiful wom
en only makes him homesick. I can't say that the col
lege situation is entirely analagous.
Our trip did not make us homesick, if for no other
reason than that we were comforted by the thought of
our Stanford friends working—or at least worrying.
"Six o'clock." we would say in New York. "They're
still in the lab."
But in 9,000 miles we haven't changed our minds
about preferring Stanford. And unless that psychol
ogist is awfully right, that may be more than one
could have said for a wife.
I was 10, the boy who lived next door and I
used to have heated debates over the relative
merits of Stanford and California. In those debates
I was not only sure that Stanford was superior to Cal
in every respect—a position still reasonably defensible
—but I was also sure that Stanford was superior to
every other university in every respect. (Rally Com
