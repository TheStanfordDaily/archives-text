When our columnist (I write with a new-found
modesty) came back from the world today and walked
into the Shack, I said, "Hello, boy, how were the
blondes?"
"I am a debater, myself," he said austerely.
"Yes, I know you are a fast talker. That's why I
asked you. Tell me, boy, how is it with the blondes
in the world?"
He thought it over. At last he said, "A blonde is a
blonde, the world over."
"The same in New York, too?"
"The same."
And I knew he had seen the world.
