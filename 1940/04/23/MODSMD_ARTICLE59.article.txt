# A 						SAD STORY
## 
### 
Let me tell you the story,
Though it's sad and it's gory,
Of what happened when fame
Took Olga, by name,
And called her Ulga
The Vulgah.
Now she tried to be nice,
Disdained loaded dice,
And never took over her shoes
To fill them with booze.
But they called her Ulga
The Vulgah.
Now she assumed simplicity
And believed implicitly
That with true propriety
She would lose this notoriety.
But they called her Ulga
The Vulgah.
She stood it for years,
Holding back her tears.
'Til one night she just had to get fried.
She mixed her drinks, got sick and died
And they still call her Ulga
The Vulgah.
