# 'Bethel Merriday' Fizzles Weakly About Stage-life
## 
### 
'BETHEL MERRIDAY," by
Sinclair Lewis.
There's a lapse of time between the
perfectly natural reaction to Sinclair
Lewis' newest book and the next
idea. That is, if you cared a tink
er's damn about it, the germs are
there for an even-tempered con
troversy.
"Stage Door," you say to yourself.
"Stage Door produced by the semi
nary seniors, starring the girl most
likely to succeed." And you have
typed the latest Lewis offering,
"Bethel Merriday." Then the thing
starts nagging, and you concede
that it's rather interesting and its
fault lies in being an accurate, vivid
account of nothing much at all.
COLLEGE EXPERIENCE
Bethel is the daughter of a Yankee
—not colonial — Connecticut family.
In the girls' college, where she grad
uates she has the part of Nora in
"Doll's House," she is seen by a
capable charlatan who has a very
good summer stock company up
state. For the wonderful experience,
she goes.
All this time she's tiny, dark, in
tense, but well adjusted. No fools'
paradise, hers: the theater calls for
craftsmanship and good, hard work,
and Bethel knows it.
ROMEO AND JULIET'
Over a nice interval she becomes
the right hand of Andy, the rich
young angel who plays Romeo as if
he were still in the Triangle Club.
She meets Zed Wintergeist, the Or
son Welles of summer stock. She
learns enough to know that her be
ing an actress is a touch and go
affair. She goes to New York.
During her well-bred trials she
realizes that touring in stock with
Andy's "Romeo and Juliet" in mod
ern dress would be a good idea.

And she's the understudy to the
imported lead.
But — and here she's thoroughly
likeable—she fluffs her big chance.
The fault lay in trying to play up to
a good conception without having
the technique to back it up, and Zed
knows it. No wonder that, when the
show finally folds, she marries him
instead of Andy.
NOVEL OR COMMENTARY?
And in March, 1939, with war
news crackling around her head, she
and Zed put their feet on the lowest
rung of the ladder that is going to
bring them success as actors-pro
ducers.
Whether Bethel Merriday is a
pretty feeble novel or is just a
benevolent commentary on the peo
ple who have too little talent for the
theater and too much talent to farm
is up to the reader to decide.—Gould

paradise, hers: the theater calls for
craftsmanship and good, hard work,
and Bethel knows it.
ROMEO AND JULIET'
Over a nice interval she becomes
the right hand of Andy, the rich
young angel who plays Romeo as if
he were still in the Triangle Club.
She meets Zed Wintergeist, the Or
son Welles of summer stock. She
learns enough to know that her be
ing an actress is a touch and go
affair. She goes to New York.
During her well-bred trials she
realizes that touring in stock with
Andy's "Romeo and Juliet" in mod
ern dress would be a good idea.

And she's the understudy to the
imported lead.
But — and here she's thoroughly
likeable—she fluffs her big chance.
The fault lay in trying to play up to
a good conception without having
the technique to back it up, and Zed
knows it. No wonder that, when the
show finally folds, she marries him
instead of Andy.
NOVEL OR COMMENTARY?
And in March, 1939, with war
news crackling around her head, she
and Zed put their feet on the lowest
rung of the ladder that is going to
bring them success as actors-pro
ducers.
Whether Bethel Merriday is a
pretty feeble novel or is just a
benevolent commentary on the peo
ple who have too little talent for the
theater and too much talent to farm
is up to the reader to decide.—Gould
'BETHEL MERRIDAY," by
Sinclair Lewis.
There's a lapse of time between the
perfectly natural reaction to Sinclair
Lewis' newest book and the next
idea. That is, if you cared a tink
er's damn about it, the germs are
there for an even-tempered con
troversy.
"Stage Door," you say to yourself.
"Stage Door produced by the semi
nary seniors, starring the girl most
likely to succeed." And you have
typed the latest Lewis offering,
"Bethel Merriday." Then the thing
starts nagging, and you concede
that it's rather interesting and its
fault lies in being an accurate, vivid
account of nothing much at all.
COLLEGE EXPERIENCE
Bethel is the daughter of a Yankee
—not colonial — Connecticut family.
In the girls' college, where she grad
uates she has the part of Nora in
"Doll's House," she is seen by a
capable charlatan who has a very
good summer stock company up
state. For the wonderful experience,
she goes.
All this time she's tiny, dark, in
tense, but well adjusted. No fools'
paradise, hers: the theater calls for
craftsmanship and good, hard work,
and Bethel knows it.
