r state of California finally
broke into the news again.
For eight months the public eye
has been focused upon events in
far away Europe. Focused upon
plots and counter- plots of World
War 11. Focused with particular at
tention upon the Scandinavian
crisis, latest development in the
grim chess game of men, ships and
airpower.
The state with the Golden Gate
has what it takes 1o break into front
page news copy. For a brief mo
ment America paused to remember
that politics was not the only na
tional news worth reading. But it
took three decisions of the Supreme
Court to splash California across
newspaper pages.
Early this week the nine hire
most barristers in the United
States made the decisions. Three
decisions which particularly in
terested California and California
people.
First ruling of the Supreme Court
invalidated in effect anti-picketing
laws in 30 California counties. Sec
ond one outlawed the Hetch Hetchy
power contract. Third okehed a
tangled legal situation involving as
sets of the Pacific State Savings and
Loan Company.
* ❖ A*
J in the anti-picketing
case was based upon a trial bal
loon floated in Shasta County. In
this test case the Supreme Court
turned an unconstitutional ruling.
Colored by A.F.L.-C.1.0. conflicts,
the Shasta test involved a dam con
struction project in which an agi
tator was convicted of violating
county anti-picketing ordinances.
County mouthpieces claimed the
law a valid exercise of the county
police power.
But county spokesmen were slap
ped on the wrist by a particularly
vivid ruling issued by the Supreme
Court through Justice Frank Mur
phy. In a whirl of (lag waving and
trumpet blowing Mr. Justice Mur
phy outlined a decision which held
that the rights of labor on the picket
line were comparable to the property
and business rights of employers.
Enthusiastic Justice Murphy
went further to say that ''the car
rying of signs and banners, no
less than the raising of a flag, is
a natural and appropriate means
of conveying information on mat
ters of public concern."
As the last fanfare of Mr. Mur
phy's trumpet died away, the Su
preme Court rose as a body to give
their second opinion, this time in
volving the Hetch Hetchy power
contract.
# >|t >|t
HPHEIR decision outlawed the San
Francisco city-Pacific Gas and
Electric Company power agreement.
The contract which received Su
preme Court condemnation involved
the sale of city-made Hetch Hetchy
water to the private utility for dis
tribution in San Francisco.
Ending a 15-year-old controversy
over the city's method of disposing
of power, the decision will cost San
Francisco an estimated $2,000,000
each year and may cause a sharp;
increase in the tax rate.
Basis of the court contention cen- j
tered about violation of the Raker i
Act of 1913. This law forbade the '
city from ever selling any corpora- !
tion or individual the right to sublet j
water or electrical energy from the)
Hetch Hetchy project. San Fran
cisco's defense held their contract an
"agency" contract, and thus not a
violation of the act.
In their third California deri
sion, the Supreme Court held that
state official Ralph Evans may use
assets of the $50,000,000 Pacific
States Savings and Loan Company
to defend his seizure of said assets
and in proceeding with liquidation
of the company.
Refusing to review the decision j
;ilready set down by the Supreme j
Court of California, the more austere j
national body upheld the view of the j
state law body.
And so, as the world marches in
military step, California holds its
own little parade. Complete with j
flag waving, electric materiel, and |
$50,000,000 in liquidated assets.

The state with the Golden Gate

newspaper pages.
Early this week the nine hire
most barristers in the United
States made the decisions. Three
decisions which particularly in
terested California and California
people.
First ruling of the Supreme Court
invalidated in effect anti-picketing
laws in 30 California counties. Sec

power contract. Third okehed a
tangled legal situation involving as
sets of the Pacific State Savings and

J in the anti-picketing
case was based upon a trial bal
loon floated in Shasta County. In
this test case the Supreme Court
turned an unconstitutional ruling.
Colored by A.F.L.-C.1.0. conflicts,
the Shasta test involved a dam con
struction project in which an agi
tator was convicted of violating
county anti-picketing ordinances.
County mouthpieces claimed the
law a valid exercise of the county
police power.
But county spokesmen were slap
ped on the wrist by a particularly
vivid ruling issued by the Supreme
Court through Justice Frank Mur
phy. In a whirl of (lag waving and
trumpet blowing Mr. Justice Mur
phy outlined a decision which held
that the rights of labor on the picket
line were comparable to the property
and business rights of employers.
Enthusiastic Justice Murphy
went further to say that ''the car
rying of signs and banners, no
less than the raising of a flag, is
a natural and appropriate means
of conveying information on mat
ters of public concern."

their second opinion, this time in
volving the Hetch Hetchy power
contract.

HPHEIR decision outlawed the San
Francisco city-Pacific Gas and
Electric Company power agreement.
The contract which received Su
preme Court condemnation involved
the sale of city-made Hetch Hetchy
water to the private utility for dis
tribution in San Francisco.
Ending a 15-year-old controversy
over the city's method of disposing
of power, the decision will cost San
Francisco an estimated $2,000,000
each year and may cause a sharp;
increase in the tax rate.
Basis of the court contention cen- j
tered about violation of the Raker i
Act of 1913. This law forbade the '
city from ever selling any corpora- !
tion or individual the right to sublet j
water or electrical energy from the)
Hetch Hetchy project. San Fran
cisco's defense held their contract an
"agency" contract, and thus not a
violation of the act.
In their third California deri
sion, the Supreme Court held that
state official Ralph Evans may use
assets of the $50,000,000 Pacific
States Savings and Loan Company
to defend his seizure of said assets
and in proceeding with liquidation
of the company.
Refusing to review the decision j
;ilready set down by the Supreme j

War 11. Focused with particular at
tention upon the Scandinavian
crisis, latest development in the
grim chess game of men, ships and
airpower.
The state with the Golden Gate
has what it takes 1o break into front
page news copy. For a brief mo
ment America paused to remember
that politics was not the only na
tional news worth reading. But it
took three decisions of the Supreme
Court to splash California across
newspaper pages.
Early this week the nine hire
most barristers in the United
States made the decisions. Three
decisions which particularly in
terested California and California
people.
First ruling of the Supreme Court
invalidated in effect anti-picketing
laws in 30 California counties. Sec
ond one outlawed the Hetch Hetchy
power contract. Third okehed a
tangled legal situation involving as
sets of the Pacific State Savings and
Loan Company.
* ❖ A*
J in the anti-picketing
case was based upon a trial bal
loon floated in Shasta County. In
this test case the Supreme Court
turned an unconstitutional ruling.
Colored by A.F.L.-C.1.0. conflicts,
the Shasta test involved a dam con
struction project in which an agi
tator was convicted of violating
county anti-picketing ordinances.
County mouthpieces claimed the
law a valid exercise of the county
police power.
But county spokesmen were slap
ped on the wrist by a particularly
vivid ruling issued by the Supreme
Court through Justice Frank Mur
phy. In a whirl of (lag waving and
trumpet blowing Mr. Justice Mur
phy outlined a decision which held
that the rights of labor on the picket
line were comparable to the property
and business rights of employers.
Enthusiastic Justice Murphy
went further to say that ''the car
rying of signs and banners, no
less than the raising of a flag, is
a natural and appropriate means
of conveying information on mat
ters of public concern."
As the last fanfare of Mr. Mur
phy's trumpet died away, the Su
preme Court rose as a body to give
their second opinion, this time in
volving the Hetch Hetchy power
contract.
# >|t >|t
HPHEIR decision outlawed the San
Francisco city-Pacific Gas and
Electric Company power agreement.
The contract which received Su
preme Court condemnation involved
the sale of city-made Hetch Hetchy
water to the private utility for dis
tribution in San Francisco.
Ending a 15-year-old controversy
over the city's method of disposing
of power, the decision will cost San
Francisco an estimated $2,000,000
each year and may cause a sharp;
increase in the tax rate.
Basis of the court contention cen- j
tered about violation of the Raker i
Act of 1913. This law forbade the '
city from ever selling any corpora- !
tion or individual the right to sublet j
water or electrical energy from the)
Hetch Hetchy project. San Fran
cisco's defense held their contract an
"agency" contract, and thus not a
violation of the act.
In their third California deri
sion, the Supreme Court held that
state official Ralph Evans may use
assets of the $50,000,000 Pacific
States Savings and Loan Company
to defend his seizure of said assets
and in proceeding with liquidation
of the company.
Refusing to review the decision j
;ilready set down by the Supreme j
Court of California, the more austere j
national body upheld the view of the j
state law body.
And so, as the world marches in
military step, California holds its
own little parade. Complete with j
flag waving, electric materiel, and |
$50,000,000 in liquidated assets.
