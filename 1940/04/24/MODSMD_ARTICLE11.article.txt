# Highway Underpass Completion Scheduled for Late December
## 
### 
Stanford's and Palo Alto's two main construction projects, the Hoover
Library and the University Avenue double underpass, will be finished at
about the same time. According to a recent estimate by Superintendent
John Leavers, of the former project, the Library will be ready for dedica
tion on or about December 31 of this year, and a report from the under-

►pass this week indicates it will be
finished near the end of the year.
Plans for the second grade separa
tion at the crossing of University
Avenue and El Camino Real are
rapidly taking shape, and work
there will begin about the middle of
June. This project, combined with
the railroad underpass, will make
University Avenue a non-stop thor
oughfare for Farm residents going
to Paly, and will also eliminate the
necessity for traffic on the highway
to stop there.
Under present plans, the highway
will be depressed about 16 feet be
low the existing grade, beginning
the downgrade opposite the old tele
graph building and reaching its nor
mal level again near the road lead
ing into the Palo Alto Hospital.
Both University Avenue and the
highway will have three lanes, the
former with center islands. Univer
sity Avenue will also be flanked by
sidewalks.
Plans for the popular clover-leaf
structure, which calls for four dif
ferent side road connections between
the avenue and the highway, have
been abandoned as too costly, ac
cording to reports. This will necessi
tate left-hand turns, but the engi
neers have promised a suitable
substitute.
The entire project will cost ap
proximately $180,000, of which $80,000
will be paid by Palo Alto and the
remainder by the state.
