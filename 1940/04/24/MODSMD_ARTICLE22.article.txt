# Excom Rescinds Approval For Boathouse Sun Deck As Project Costs Treble
## Jenkins, Cobbs, Berry Appointed To Special Committee Investigating Cheaper Methods of Construction 
### DICK DUDMAN 
Local sun bathers lost (hoir projected Boathouse sun deck again last
night; the reason—trebling of the estimated cost of the job.
Putting a floor on the left roof of the Boathouse would cost $25ti.2A
not $84. the estimate on which last week's approval of the new deck
was based. This was the report to Ex Committee of Student Manager John

►Cobbs, who said it was a "kick in
the tummy" to find how the cost
had jumped.
LOOPHOLE FOUND
Agreeing this was more than they
could afford, committeemen re
scinded last week's action.
They left one loop-hole. With the
University's approval, the A.S.S.U.
could refuse the Corporation Yard's
figure ($256.26) and undertake the
project at a figure submitted by
Daily Editor Arch Jenkins ($100),
which would entail purchase of lum
ber in Palo Alto and student volun
teer labor.
Jenkins, Cobbs, and Sylvia Berry
were appointed a committee to
probe this loop-hole, to draw up
rock-bottom plans and submit them
to the University for approval.
COSTS ITEMIZED
Cobb.s introduced the subject, pre
senting the Corporation Yard's esti
mate and explaining that, since the
Boathouse now is a University
building, all work regularly would
have to be done by the Yard.
A breakdown of this estimate, he
said, includes $136 for the flooring
lumber, $24 for stringers, $1.50 for
nails, $57.60 for labor, and $37.16 for
the Yard's "tax" (profit).
Jenkins termed these figures "ex
orbitant," asserting he could get the
necessary 1700 board feet of first
grade Oregon lumber for $110,
cheaper lumber at as low a price as
$95.
STUDENTS MAY WORK
"The Corporation Yard's chargc is
exorbitant," he declared. "I could
get 100 kids, pretty fair carpenters,
and we could have the thing built
for $100 in a day and a half.
"I don't see why Ex Committee
should sit back and take things like
this. If we're going to give the Uni
verstiy an improvement, we ought to
be able to buy it where we want
to."
APPROVAL NEEDED
"If he can do it that cheaply, why
can't we take it?" asked Sylvia
Berry.
"I wonder if we'd want to accept a
job like that," mused Burroughs An
derson.
Cobbs said he considered it "re
motely possible" that the University
would permit anyone but the Cor
poration Yard to put a sun deck
on the Boathouse.
Other business follows:
LECTURE SERIES: Following a
report of heavy losses this year, Ex
Committee dccidcd informally
against a regular series next year.
Cobbs reported a loss of $445 this
year (Cooper, Curie) as compared
with only $215 last year (Gunther,
Shecan).
"Apparently a majority of Stan
ford students don't think that's the
way they want to spend their mon
ey," said Vice-President Coline Up
shak, summing up the discussion.
She presided in absence of Presi
dent Ken Cuthbertson.
LATE PATRON LIST: Although
the Alpha Delts were late in turning
