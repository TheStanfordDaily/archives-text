# Farm Production of 'Richard' Is Result of 10 Years' Planning
## 
### MARY JUDSON 
Stanford's production of '"Rich
ard II" has been planned for more
than 10 years.
"Ever since my tindergraduate
days at Northwestern, where I cut
and planned the Shakespeare trag
edy for a degree thesis, I have hoped
to produce 'Richard' according to
my own pattern." .
With these emphatic words F.
Cowles Strickland, lecturer in dra
matic art and director of most of
the Speech and Drama Division's
productions, settled down to tell of
his brief but telling experiences in
putting on Shakespeare plays.
HIS CAREER RICH'
Reminiscing over his Shakespear
(an career, Mr. Strickland decided
it had been limited, but definitely
rich and thoroughly unhampered.

He has produced only three of the
Bard's plays but he has had a world
of fun and has gained a fund of
knowledge in doing them.
Mr. Strickland's first attempt at
"Richard II" was made in St. Louis
long before Maurice Evans capital
ized on the play as a sure audience
hit.
"I won't forget that production,"
I Mr. Strickland declared. "It was
| produced in a theater with a smaller
I stage than our present Litlle The
j ater. That made the production all
! the more difficult since 'Richard' is
j a play that has to be done on a
grand scale to be effective. I had
to leave out the whole Jinal coro
nation scene, and that's as bad as
leaving out the final triumphal scene
in 'Romeo and Juliet'."
SUCCESS IN ST. LOUIS
The St. Louis production was an
! overwhelming success, running
| double the time scheduled for it.
"I felt good about that, because it
had been actually years since any
one had produced the play in this
country," continued Mr. Strickland.
As with most of his casts, Mr.
Strickland, "Strick," had a good deal
I of fun with his first '"Richard"
| players. "The actor cast as Richard
i had a tough time with the rest of
I the class," he recalled.
I UN WITH THE CAST
"In the scene where Richard has
to gaze into a hand mirror, the actor
j found a funny poem written on it
j He had enough composure to keep a
straight face, but when his cue came
to throw the mirror to tiie door,
"Richard" hurled the glass off the
j stage and it caught the guilty one
j right on the back of the neck."

matic art and director of most of
the Speech and Drama Division's
productions, settled down to tell of
his brief but telling experiences in
putting on Shakespeare plays.
HIS CAREER RICH'
Reminiscing over his Shakespear
(an career, Mr. Strickland decided
it had been limited, but definitely
rich and thoroughly unhampered.

He has produced only three of the
Bard's plays but he has had a world
of fun and has gained a fund of
knowledge in doing them.
Mr. Strickland's first attempt at
"Richard II" was made in St. Louis
long before Maurice Evans capital
ized on the play as a sure audience
hit.
"I won't forget that production,"
I Mr. Strickland declared. "It was
| produced in a theater with a smaller
I stage than our present Litlle The
j ater. That made the production all
! the more difficult since 'Richard' is
j a play that has to be done on a
grand scale to be effective. I had
to leave out the whole Jinal coro
nation scene, and that's as bad as
leaving out the final triumphal scene
in 'Romeo and Juliet'."
SUCCESS IN ST. LOUIS
The St. Louis production was an
! overwhelming success, running
| double the time scheduled for it.
"I felt good about that, because it
had been actually years since any
one had produced the play in this
country," continued Mr. Strickland.
As with most of his casts, Mr.
Strickland, "Strick," had a good deal
I of fun with his first '"Richard"
| players. "The actor cast as Richard
i had a tough time with the rest of
I the class," he recalled.
I UN WITH THE CAST
"In the scene where Richard has
to gaze into a hand mirror, the actor
j found a funny poem written on it
j He had enough composure to keep a
straight face, but when his cue came
to throw the mirror to tiie door,
"Richard" hurled the glass off the
j stage and it caught the guilty one
j right on the back of the neck."
Stanford's production of '"Rich
ard II" has been planned for more
than 10 years.
"Ever since my tindergraduate
days at Northwestern, where I cut
and planned the Shakespeare trag
edy for a degree thesis, I have hoped
to produce 'Richard' according to
my own pattern." .
With these emphatic words F.
Cowles Strickland, lecturer in dra
matic art and director of most of
the Speech and Drama Division's
productions, settled down to tell of
his brief but telling experiences in
putting on Shakespeare plays.
