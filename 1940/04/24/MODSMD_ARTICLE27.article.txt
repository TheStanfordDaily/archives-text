# Cardinal Plans Omit Masque Ball This Year
## New Entertainment To Replace Former Home Drive Feature 
### 
i Because the Masque Ball has not
made a substantial profit in the last
j two years it has been dropped from
J the Convalescent Home Drive this
j year, according to Chairman Ned
Pugh.
! A new all-campus entertainment
i to replace the Ball will be discussed
[at 5:30 o'clock this afternoon at
j Cardinals meeting. "It must be big
and make money because after all,
j that's the purpose of the drive,"
J Pugh said.
BALL UNPROFITABLE
Until three years ago the Masque
Ball, highlighted by a Queen contest,
! was the largest single money-maker
J of the drive with profits sometimes
| running into the thousands. The
I last year of the contest the dance
| made $635. The first year the con
test was dropped the profits were
only $148.
The Baby Party two years ago
I made a little over $50 and last year's
j Arabian Nights dance, which was
| attended by about 80 couples, lost
!$l5O.
SEEK NEW ACTIVITY
j Since there are already several
: dances featuring "big-name bands,"
j Cardinals is looking for some dif
j ferent activity, Pugh said.
Interviews for volunteers to work
: on the drive will be continued by
Pugh and Ken Koch in Rooms 15 and
13 of the Old Union today and to
j morrow from 1 to 2 o'clock; and in
Room 13 tomorrow from 4:30 to 5:30
o'clock.
