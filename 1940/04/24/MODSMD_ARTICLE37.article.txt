It happened in oui own backyard,
but even then only about 200 people
saw our Stanford baseball club slap
down the mighty Trojan Monday
afternoon. The Indians who have
played to empty stands most of the
season when performing in the
Sunken Diamond personally saw to
it that baseball will be another
sport the HMO Trojans can't lay
claim to.

AFTER LOSING SERIES after se
ries in the C.1.8.A. to the Bears,
Gaels, Broncos, and Bruins, the
Stanlords knocked that horsehide
around to nab an 8-7 decision and
with it their only series. They took
a game down south last month with
Cootie Thompson pitching, and Mon
day they used the Coot to save the
ball game in the late innings.
It was a hit ironical that Cootie
who maybe won a game once upon
a time with the help of his team
mates' hats had to go in to save a
game in which Ins mates had built
up one of their largest scores of
the year without his being on the
firing line.
Seeing his buddies collect after a
couple of weeks' drought of base
hits, Cootie bemoaned his fate of be
ing in the dugout at such a time. It
just wasn't right for him to slave
away with two. three, and four-hit
games and lose, and then see his
buddies bang out triples and doubles I
all over the place—and above all
bring in runs.
So Cootie stomped up and down
the dugout, looked toward the
heavens as if he were expecting to
sec manna descending upon a bar
ren land, and meanwhile was
saying: "Base-hits, base-hits."
NOW THAT OUR Indians have
taken the baseball series, 2-1, from
El 1 roje, and our golf team has ;
humiliated Southern California's
best. 23 1 /a to 4 1 a, it looks as if (but
cross your fingers first) the track
team may make it an unprecedented '
three sports taken from Troy.
As a result of the defeat, the
Trojans who had a mathematical
chance for the C.1.8.A. title before
meeting Harry Wolter's nine has
dropped this championship to the 1
Gaels.
But don't feel sorry for Troy. They
only won the basketball title out
right. tied with the Bruins for the
football crown, and won tennis. 1
swimming, ice hockey (L.A. league), I
etc.

AFTER LOSING SERIES after se
ries in the C.1.8.A. to the Bears,
Gaels, Broncos, and Bruins, the
Stanlords knocked that horsehide
around to nab an 8-7 decision and
with it their only series. They took
a game down south last month with
Cootie Thompson pitching, and Mon
day they used the Coot to save the
ball game in the late innings.
It was a hit ironical that Cootie
who maybe won a game once upon
a time with the help of his team
mates' hats had to go in to save a
game in which Ins mates had built
up one of their largest scores of
the year without his being on the
firing line.
Seeing his buddies collect after a
couple of weeks' drought of base
hits, Cootie bemoaned his fate of be
ing in the dugout at such a time. It
just wasn't right for him to slave
away with two. three, and four-hit
games and lose, and then see his
buddies bang out triples and doubles I
all over the place—and above all
bring in runs.
So Cootie stomped up and down
the dugout, looked toward the
heavens as if he were expecting to
sec manna descending upon a bar
ren land, and meanwhile was
saying: "Base-hits, base-hits."
NOW THAT OUR Indians have
taken the baseball series, 2-1, from
El 1 roje, and our golf team has ;
humiliated Southern California's
best. 23 1 /a to 4 1 a, it looks as if (but
cross your fingers first) the track
team may make it an unprecedented '
three sports taken from Troy.
As a result of the defeat, the
Trojans who had a mathematical
chance for the C.1.8.A. title before
meeting Harry Wolter's nine has
dropped this championship to the 1
Gaels.
But don't feel sorry for Troy. They
only won the basketball title out
right. tied with the Bruins for the
football crown, and won tennis. 1
swimming, ice hockey (L.A. league), I

IN THE SPRING we have more
than one spring practice going on
besides football. Basketball aspi
rants are keeping in trim and ex
perimenting with the 12-foot back
board and the 20-inch hoop under
Coach De an.
And out on the soccer field, Coach
Harry Maloney has been conducting
practice a couple of times a week
getting .set for next fall's campaign.
It happened in oui own backyard,
but even then only about 200 people
saw our Stanford baseball club slap
down the mighty Trojan Monday
afternoon. The Indians who have
played to empty stands most of the
season when performing in the
Sunken Diamond personally saw to
it that baseball will be another
sport the HMO Trojans can't lay
claim to.

AFTER LOSING SERIES after se
ries in the C.1.8.A. to the Bears,
Gaels, Broncos, and Bruins, the
Stanlords knocked that horsehide
around to nab an 8-7 decision and
with it their only series. They took
a game down south last month with
Cootie Thompson pitching, and Mon
day they used the Coot to save the
ball game in the late innings.
It was a hit ironical that Cootie
who maybe won a game once upon
a time with the help of his team
mates' hats had to go in to save a
game in which Ins mates had built
up one of their largest scores of
the year without his being on the
firing line.
Seeing his buddies collect after a
couple of weeks' drought of base
hits, Cootie bemoaned his fate of be
ing in the dugout at such a time. It
just wasn't right for him to slave
away with two. three, and four-hit
games and lose, and then see his
buddies bang out triples and doubles I
all over the place—and above all
bring in runs.
So Cootie stomped up and down
the dugout, looked toward the
heavens as if he were expecting to
sec manna descending upon a bar
ren land, and meanwhile was
saying: "Base-hits, base-hits."
NOW THAT OUR Indians have
taken the baseball series, 2-1, from
El 1 roje, and our golf team has ;
humiliated Southern California's
best. 23 1 /a to 4 1 a, it looks as if (but
cross your fingers first) the track
team may make it an unprecedented '
three sports taken from Troy.
As a result of the defeat, the
Trojans who had a mathematical
chance for the C.1.8.A. title before
meeting Harry Wolter's nine has
dropped this championship to the 1
Gaels.
But don't feel sorry for Troy. They
only won the basketball title out
right. tied with the Bruins for the
football crown, and won tennis. 1
swimming, ice hockey (L.A. league), I
etc.

THE DAILY TROJAN sports edi
tor has discovered that another one
ol those mythical "national cham
pionships" has been discovered. This
one is for basketball, and it has the
usual rating system.
Dick Dunkel of Mountain Lakes.
N.J.. lias come up with Southern
California as the national champ,
t«» which we agree, but we don't
like Dunkcl's picking Everett
Dean's cagers 44tli in the nation,
while Santa Clara is 17th and Cali
fornia is 38th.
Following the Trojans are Colo
rado, Indiana, N.Y.U.. Duquesne, |
Purdue, Oklahoma Aggies, Michi
gan State, Perm State, and Rice.
Indiana is the team which Coach i

Dean left to come out here and
which had a flashv bunch of fresh
iikii and sophomores coming up
l.efore lie left. The Iloosicrs will
meet Stanford next Christmas va
cation, prohahly in San Francisco,
and we'll bet that Stanford will
make it mighty tough for them if
they don't beat them.
