# Mush Girard Big Question Of Cal Meet
## 
### 
Will he run or won't he? That is
the question bothering Stanford's
varsity tiaok coach Bill Ellington
not to mention any person at
tempting to predict the outcome of
; Stanfoid's approaching Big Meet
with California. The gentleman in
question is Ellington's crack milcr,
Mushy Girard.
Dr. Paul Davies, team physician,
advised Ellington that it would be
unwise to allow Girard to run until
lit was certain that his cramped
muscle had had sufficient rest,
i Whereupon Ellington promptly stat
led that he would not risk Mush
I against Cal but would save him for
the future when his points might
prove more valuable.
SUN NEEDED
Yet yesterday the decision was re
versed, and it was reported that
Girard could perform safely provid
ed there was waim weather for the
meet. So now whether or not the
Cards run one-two in the mile de
pends upon the sunshine when Sat
urday rolls around.
Meanwhile, facing almost wintry
blasts, the Indian tracksters worked
out for the first time on the site of
the coming meet, the stadium track
and field. Despite the chilly weather,
the jumpers and vaulters felt out the
strange take-offs and the quarfer
milers jogged and sprinted on the
newly rolled cinderpath.
RELAY TEAM WORKS
Clyde Jeffrey, Craig Williamson,
Charlie Shaw, and Ernie Clark,
world champions in the mile relay,
floated through a 50-flat 440 in an
effort to get the feel of the curves.
The two Moores, Paul and Jack,
spun four laps in mediocre time in
the unfamiliar surroundings.
Only the weight hieii appeared im
mediately at home for they are the
least influenced by a new track.
Stan Andersen showed that he is
back at his early season form when
he tossed the shot 52 ft. 6 in. and the
discus 153 ft. Bill Trout caught
hold of a couple of good puts in
the shot, the best being 50 ft. 5 in.
STARTERS DOUBTFUL
On both the Bear and Indian
squads there are men ailing and
many doubtful starters. These in
juries and uncertainties make pre
dicting the meet a tough job. Still,
the, Cards, with their victory in the
relays over Cal and their successes
since then, reign favorites.
Up at Berkeley, iittle Stan Sadaj I
is a doubtful starter in the mile or
the two-mile. Capable of around
4:15 in the mile. Sadaj at his best
form could uncomfortably press
Stanford's Moore and Girard. And
in the two-mile. Sadaj and his
teammates, Vollmer and Cooper, are
untouchable.

The two Moores, Paul and Jack,
spun four laps in mediocre time in

Only the weight hieii appeared im
mediately at home for they are the
least influenced by a new track.
Stan Andersen showed that he is
back at his early season form when
he tossed the shot 52 ft. 6 in. and the
discus 153 ft. Bill Trout caught
hold of a couple of good puts in
the shot, the best being 50 ft. 5 in.
STARTERS DOUBTFUL
On both the Bear and Indian
squads there are men ailing and
many doubtful starters. These in
juries and uncertainties make pre
dicting the meet a tough job. Still,
the, Cards, with their victory in the
relays over Cal and their successes
since then, reign favorites.
Up at Berkeley, iittle Stan Sadaj I
is a doubtful starter in the mile or
the two-mile. Capable of around
4:15 in the mile. Sadaj at his best
form could uncomfortably press
Stanford's Moore and Girard. And
in the two-mile. Sadaj and his
teammates, Vollmer and Cooper, are
untouchable.
India contains 15 British prov- ;
inces and 12 semi-autonomous states i

Will he run or won't he? That is
the question bothering Stanford's
varsity tiaok coach Bill Ellington
not to mention any person at
tempting to predict the outcome of
; Stanfoid's approaching Big Meet
with California. The gentleman in
question is Ellington's crack milcr,
Mushy Girard.
Dr. Paul Davies, team physician,
advised Ellington that it would be
unwise to allow Girard to run until
lit was certain that his cramped
muscle had had sufficient rest,
i Whereupon Ellington promptly stat
led that he would not risk Mush
I against Cal but would save him for
the future when his points might
prove more valuable.
SUN NEEDED
Yet yesterday the decision was re
versed, and it was reported that
Girard could perform safely provid
ed there was waim weather for the
meet. So now whether or not the
Cards run one-two in the mile de
pends upon the sunshine when Sat
urday rolls around.
Meanwhile, facing almost wintry
blasts, the Indian tracksters worked
out for the first time on the site of
the coming meet, the stadium track
and field. Despite the chilly weather,
the jumpers and vaulters felt out the
strange take-offs and the quarfer
milers jogged and sprinted on the
newly rolled cinderpath.
