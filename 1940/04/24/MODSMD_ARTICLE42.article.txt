# Gridders Fail to Scrimmage As 100 Spectators Turn Out
## 
### 
Over 10(1 i<arm {.'rid fans braved a chilj wind yesterday afternoon to
watch Coach Clark Shaughncssy's Indians run though a two-hour drill.
Ihe squad didn't put on the expected scrimmage, contenting them
selves with the usual work on fundamentals and an hour of dummy scrim
mage. Ihe (irsf scrum ot the year will therefore probably take place this

in secret practice.
Coach Shaughnessy, with assist
ants Jim Lawson, Husky Hunt, and
| Marchie Schwartz, supervised the
i first and second teams in dummy
i scrimmage. Phil Benston, Bernie
i Masterson, and Harry Shipkey han
died the rest of the squad at the
j other end of the field.
The new Indian mentor evidently
j wasn't looling when he told press
I and alumni gatherings that he in
i tended to fit the system to the play
ers. With an "A" backfield of
' Frankie Albert, Pete Kmetovic,
' Hugh Gallarneau and Norm Stand
j lee, most of the plays are designed
! to emphasize the strong points and
cover up (he weaknesses of the
! players.
ALBERT DOESN'T BLOCK
In the new formation Albert,
j never a devastating blocker, has
| practically no blocking assignments,
j Gallarneau and Kmetovic, a couple
j of speed burners, have several plays
calculated to spring (hem into the
open. Standlee, a powerhouse, car
ries the ball on quick opening plays
and cutbacks.
