# Clubs Favored In Frosh Meet
## 
### 
Papoose Bob Smith will have the
thankless task of running against
Grover Klemmer Friday when the
Ceil and Stanford freshmen tangle at
Edwards Field in Berkeley. Jack
Weiershauser thinks Smith is ca
pable of 50 fiat anyway but Klom
mer could take the quarter even
after running the mile and two-mile
if he went in for distances.
Smith ought to sneak in there for
â– i second and may surprise himself
with his best time of the season. He
certainly won't lack competition.
The Papooses should gather at
least 40 points if Vern Hart is in
shape. This would be a great im
provement over last year's Little Big
Meet in which the Farm frosh only
garnered 18 digits.
There s still an outside chance
that the Stanford can take the Ber
keley yearlings, provided that some
<>t the question-mark boys" come
through.
