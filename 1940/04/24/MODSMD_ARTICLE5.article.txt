# Luncheon Club To Hear Bunn
## Dean Will Consider Housemother Issue 
### 
Houscmothers for Stanford fra
ternities is the stand Dean of Men
John Bunn will take today when he
speaks before Lunch Clubbers at 12
o clock in the Nitery. Anyone on the
campus is invited to attend.
Recognized as a current contro
versial issue, the advisability of in
stalling housemothers is receiving a
large amount of consideration by
students and faculty. Delta Sigma
Rho is to sponsor a debate on the
issue May 6.
Dean Bunn first raised the issue
in a recommendation published at
the first of the quarter in the Annual
Report of the President. At that
time he stated that, "I do not believe
that our fraternities as a whole in
practice are contributing to the Uni
versity or to the experience of the
students to the extent that it is
possible from the very nature of the
organization.
"I feel sure that if each frater
nity would secure a housemother,
her presence and influence would
add much toward making the house
a real home."
The Dean of Men will explain his
stand on the subject today at the
noon meeting. Avowing that he
feels the average student does not al
together understand his position, he
plans to clarify the issue.
Virgil Hinshaw, member of the
Luncheon Club steering committee,
is chairman of today's meeting.
