THOSE of you who read the second-page story
yesterday about the two Stanford students
and friend in an aeroplane who were forced
down on the Presidentially restricted Mare Is
land naval ammunition depot last week-end
probably got the impression that it was the end
of a riotous joy-ride. Those of you who read
the now affirmed statements of one of the pas
sengers aie undoubtedly quite sure that it was
all in fun.
Unfortunately this particular passenger was
making cute quips for the press when she
should have been thanking Marion Jackson for
the skillful aircraft that enabled her to bring the
ship and her two friends to a safe and a live
landing.
Her cleverness of speech after such a crisis
would be harmful and insulting enough in an
ordinary escape from catastrophe, but her
tongue-wagging in the face of a Civil Aero
nautics Authority investigation is next to un
pardonable. The Daily made the mistake of
listening to her garble with the C.A.A. inquiry
pending, but the initial mistake—the mistake of
speaking for the pilot — was hers and hers
alone.
Briefly Miss Jackson's problem is this: She
did land on a government reservation, one of
three such closed zones on the Pacific Coast,
and therefore must stand the embarrassment
and possible penalty of the C.A.A. But she also
saved two lives in the process. Her problem,
then, is only a matter of presenting an honest
and straightforward account of just what hap
pened before she landed on the Island. Neither
The Daily nor the flying and flighty passenger
can speak for the Authority in passing judg
ment after the pilot has given her version of
what actually did occur.
Miss Jackson, who is honored by being sec
retary-treasurer of the Stanford Flying Club,
greatest of its kind in the world, and who has
had a private license since 1936, should have a
minimum of trouble explaining her plight. It
is to be hoped that the C.A.A. is cognizant of
her ability and sincerity before it makes any
decision.
In case the story of the trip still isn't known,
it all began with Miss Jackson leaving Burbank
in a borrowed plane last week-end. Cloudy
skies and tricky weather apparently put her off
her course to Palo Alto so that she ended up
on another arm of the Bay, near Vallejo, with a
thimbleful of gasoline left in the tanks.
The tenseness of the situation and a feeling
for the safety of her passengers compelled her
to land as quickly as she could and anywhere
she could. She dropped between two huge
ammunition sheds and maneuvered so well that
the Island mechanics had to tow the machine
to another spot before it could be raised and
brought back to Palo Alto by its owner.
Contrary to the unauthoritative passenger's
meanderings, the plane had all the maps re
quired by law. Stanford aviation enthusiasts
and Miss Jackson, also contrarily, do not see
anything "silly" about the unfortunate incident.
They only hope, as does The Daily, that Stan
ford's top woman aviator is absolved of any
negligence in the affair. Stanford's reputation
in the air, as well as her own, is too good to
be blemished by the babblings of a woman
who might be dead today.

all in fun.
Unfortunately this particular passenger was
making cute quips for the press when she
should have been thanking Marion Jackson for
the skillful aircraft that enabled her to bring the
ship and her two friends to a safe and a live
landing.
Her cleverness of speech after such a crisis
would be harmful and insulting enough in an
ordinary escape from catastrophe, but her
tongue-wagging in the face of a Civil Aero
nautics Authority investigation is next to un
pardonable. The Daily made the mistake of
listening to her garble with the C.A.A. inquiry
pending, but the initial mistake—the mistake of
speaking for the pilot — was hers and hers
alone.
Briefly Miss Jackson's problem is this: She
did land on a government reservation, one of
three such closed zones on the Pacific Coast,
and therefore must stand the embarrassment
and possible penalty of the C.A.A. But she also
saved two lives in the process. Her problem,
then, is only a matter of presenting an honest
and straightforward account of just what hap
pened before she landed on the Island. Neither
The Daily nor the flying and flighty passenger
can speak for the Authority in passing judg
ment after the pilot has given her version of
what actually did occur.
Miss Jackson, who is honored by being sec
retary-treasurer of the Stanford Flying Club,
greatest of its kind in the world, and who has
had a private license since 1936, should have a
minimum of trouble explaining her plight. It
is to be hoped that the C.A.A. is cognizant of
her ability and sincerity before it makes any
decision.
In case the story of the trip still isn't known,
it all began with Miss Jackson leaving Burbank
in a borrowed plane last week-end. Cloudy
skies and tricky weather apparently put her off
her course to Palo Alto so that she ended up
on another arm of the Bay, near Vallejo, with a
thimbleful of gasoline left in the tanks.
The tenseness of the situation and a feeling
for the safety of her passengers compelled her
to land as quickly as she could and anywhere
she could. She dropped between two huge
ammunition sheds and maneuvered so well that
the Island mechanics had to tow the machine
to another spot before it could be raised and
brought back to Palo Alto by its owner.
Contrary to the unauthoritative passenger's
meanderings, the plane had all the maps re
quired by law. Stanford aviation enthusiasts
and Miss Jackson, also contrarily, do not see
anything "silly" about the unfortunate incident.
They only hope, as does The Daily, that Stan
ford's top woman aviator is absolved of any
negligence in the affair. Stanford's reputation
in the air, as well as her own, is too good to
be blemished by the babblings of a woman
who might be dead today.
THOSE of you who read the second-page story
yesterday about the two Stanford students
and friend in an aeroplane who were forced
down on the Presidentially restricted Mare Is
land naval ammunition depot last week-end
probably got the impression that it was the end
of a riotous joy-ride. Those of you who read
the now affirmed statements of one of the pas
sengers aie undoubtedly quite sure that it was
all in fun.
