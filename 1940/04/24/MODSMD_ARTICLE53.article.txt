# In and Out the Window
## 
### 
WOULD you like to climb back into a burn
ing building from a fire escape in order
to reach the ground? We don't think that we
would either. Yet that is the situation that ex
ists in Encina Hall today.
This cry, of Encina as a fire hazard, has been
raised before and the result was that the Uni
versity spent $1500 for new fire-escapes; but
that far from cured all the existing evils (all
this is aside from the evil of false alarms that
the freshmen by this time have learned to sleep
through).
In case of fire, students occupying rooms on
the three top floors would be forced to climb
dov/n the fire-escapes and through a second
floor window, run through the burning halls,
and finally sgueeze out through another win
dow to final safety on the Commons roof. The
mass confusion and mob rule of such a situation
would be almost as murderous as the fire itself.
This is not the place to play fire chief or civil

engineer—the University has men to do these
jobs. Every layman, however, has seen such
aids as drop ladders leading directly to the
ground which, in the case of Encina, would re
lieve the congestion to the commons roof and
remove the necessity of re-entering the burn
ing building. Or perhaps additional escapes
could be placed at each end of the hall.
If a major conflagration were to occur and
many lives were lost, the conscience of the
school would have a difficult time erasing the
memory from its history.—G. H.
