## HOW COULD THEY? 
### 
JMIE EDITOR, SIR:
It was not amazing, of course, to learn that this
year's Junior Prom was a tremendous successâ€”pleas
urably, socially, and financially. How could Stanford's
outstanding class possibly miss?
But despite the fact that it is no surprise, this
absentee president is so grateful for the brilliant work
of the Junior Prom committees that he wishes to thank
'41's stalwarts for an expected but wonderful per
formance.
To Grey Bryan and all of his co-workers, my sin
cere thanks.
Sherman Mellinkoif
