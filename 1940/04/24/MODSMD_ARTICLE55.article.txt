# BULL SESSION
## THE 						CROWD ROARS 
### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
\ SLOW prize-fight never arouses much partisan
ship. The crowd is usually apathetic, and any en
thusiasm that happens to surge in the onlookers is
directed against both boxers or the referee. It takes
color and action to work up a good howl for one
fighter and vicarious punches at the other.
Great Britain and Germany had been moving
around rather cautiously until the Norwegian inva
sion. They were only feeling each other out on the
Maginot-Siegfried front, and most of the fighting fell
into two classes: economic fighting, which lays the
groundwork for blitzkriegs and mass-murder but does
n't look sensational; and verbal fighting, which lays the
groundwork for true and false beliefs but still isn't as
sensational as a naval battle.
But the armies are sparring in earnest now, and
slowly the crowd is beginning to roar. More people are
talking about war. More of our national figures are
gaining notoriety with indiscretion that dapper dunce
Cromwell, for instance. More headlines are selling
more newspapers. More Germans and more English
are being killed. More ships are being sunk. And more
Americans are becoming incensed—just a bit hyster
ical.

bwJj^ XPEUTS" are predicting with 1917-certainty that
Germany will invade South America within six
month after she subjects France and England. Law
rence Hunt, National Labor Relations Board Counsel,
declares, as "a plain American citizen," "We have
fought for freedom in the past, and we will fight for it
again." (One begins to think that we aren't such
damned good fighters if we fought for freedom last
time.)
And underneath all the roaring, the plain, dispas
sionate facts remain intact —in good shape to be ig
nored. Great Britain is still fighting for economic
supremacy, not democracy. The Allies are still justi
fying Versailles, not a peace of equality. And Ger
many is still very remote from the Western Hem
isphere.
But the real ends and the disgusting causes are
obscured as the fighting grows more intense. Sym
pathy, not thinking, mounts. And so, while Germany
is no less remote than ever from America, America is
less remote than ever from Germany.
Norway is the arena. Economic supremacy is the
j prize. Britain and Germany are the fighters. America
I is the crowd. And the crowd roars.
