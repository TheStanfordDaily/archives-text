# 'Smattering of Ignorance' Displays Levant's Humor

### 
"A Smattering of Ignorance" by Os
car Levant.
Before Oscar Levant came into
national prominence as the musical
sage of "Information Please," it is
probable that the lack of demand
for a book by Levant was tre
mendous.
Of course Levant is a pretty darn
good concert pianist, probably the
greatest living interpreter of George
Gershwin, is known as a perhaps
promising American composer, and
the author of two hit tunes—"Lidy,
Play Your Mandolin" and "Blame It
on My Youth." But none of these
things, somehow, made the masses
yearn to know Levant's opinions.
DEMAND PERFORMANCE
The masses began to notice Levant
when he popped up as guest iitftist
on the "stump-the-experts" pro
gram. His impudence, amazing
knowledge of music, and quick rep
artee created a demand first for his
permanent presence on "Informa
tion Please" and then for a book
by him.
"A Smattering of Ignorance" is
the result of this demand; and, un
like so many books written at re
quest, it's good. Nothing weighty or
particularly deep. It's just pure
Levant talking mostly about music
and musicians i'i his own flip, witty
style.
si.\ ESSAYS
Each of the six essays in the book
i.s worth while in itself, and the
information i.s not only worth know
ing, but worth reading just for the
way it's told. Levant seems authori
tative, whether he is or not, and
anyhow what if he isn't? lie's fun.
"Music in Aspic" is an analysis of,
interwoven with yarns about, the
various symphony orchestras, their
personnel and conductors. Harpo
Marx, a fine musician in his own
| right, is the subject of "Memoirs of
a Mute." "The Boys Are March
ing" takes up young American com
posers, their musical stature, where
I they're heading, and what their
| chances are.
Coming near the top of the list in
i interest is "A Cog in the Wheel."

which is an explanation of the in
tricacies of "mood" music in the
movies. And as an elegy to a friend
"My Life, or the Story of George
Gershwin" stanJs high because ol
its narration of Levant's friendship
with Gershwin.—Nowell
