political day the slogan may
be, "As Stanford goes, so goes
the nation."
But not for some time.
Last week embryo student poli
ticians trooped into the auditorium
of the Education Building. Two
hours later, the meeting over, Stan
ford theoretically rang down the
curtain on President Roosevelt's
third-term hopes.
This morning Fortune magazine
appears with the latest of its
famous nation-wide public opin
ion polls. The results of the can
vass indicate that while a slight
majority of the American electo
rate favors the two-term tradition,
the President was still top-heavy
as the nation's choice for 1940.
Almost half of the electorate voted
thumbs-down on a third-term.
Slightly over 40 per cent were in
favor. And a bit over 9 per cent
didn't give a damn.
In Stanford's S.P.U. open meeting,
Democrat Cordell Hull was the stu
dent choice for the Presidency of
the United States. Mr. Roosevelt
was a poor second. The G.O.P. ban
ner trailed dismally in the dust of
the Farm's Education Building audi
torium.

FORTUNE'S survey in 1936 came
uncomfortably close in its re
sults. It practically hit the political
nail on the head. This year national
crystal gazers are paying a great
deal more attention to Fortune mag
azine and its findings.
This latest poll of theirs put
President Roosevelt in a fairly
comfortable position. Regardless
of third-term prejudices, the man
in the White House was decidedly
the most popular of the candidates
considered in the tabulation. He
outranked the six outstanding
Democratic possibilities and the six
strongest Republicans by a size
able margin.
Over 35 per cent of the electorate
chose to hear fireside chats from
Franklin for the next four yeai's.
Mr. Roosevelt's total vole of con
fidence was more than the combined
vote given the six leading Repub
licans. He steam-rollered G.O.P.
white hope Thomas Dewey by a
two and a half times majority.
Thirty-eight-year-old, moustache
wearing Dewey received only 15 per
cent of the total vote cast in the
Fortune poll. At that he was top
man in the list of Republican aspi
rants.
In Stanford's trial balloon, Dewey
ranked second to Robert A. Taft as
the leading G.O.P. Neither reached
final balloting.
* * ♦
dusting through the na
tion's favorites for the 1940
nomination, Fortune's poll rolled up
its sleeves and waded into a discus
sion of the New Deal.
The survey indicated that the up
per income bracket was extremely
opposed to a third-term and contin
uation of the Rooscveltian policies.
The lower income group backed the
President almost to a man. In "dis
covering" that the middle class were
the deciding factor, Fortune merely
repeated the 8-year-old fact.
One out of every five Fortune
voters desired the repeal of most
of the New Deal measures. Half
that number wished to see the New
Deal develop still further. Stan
ford sentiment, as expressed in the
S.P.U. meeting, wished to see the
New Deal on the skids.
Almost 40 per cent of these in
cluded in Fortune's poll wished to
at least see Rooscveltian measures
modified considerably.
Various "dark horse" presidential
possibilities were omitted by For
tune in (lie voting on individual
preferences. Most pretentious of
those not mentioned were Demo
cratic Senator Burton K. Wheeler,
and Republican utilities magnate!
Wendell Wilkie.
However, Fortune admittedly j
picked the cream of the 1940 crop. |
As her voters testified when they an
swered "no" to the question: "Can
you name anyone you would prefer j
to any of these six Democrats and j
six Republicans?"

FORTUNE'S survey in 1936 came
uncomfortably close in its re
sults. It practically hit the political
nail on the head. This year national
crystal gazers are paying a great
deal more attention to Fortune mag
azine and its findings.
This latest poll of theirs put
President Roosevelt in a fairly
comfortable position. Regardless
of third-term prejudices, the man
in the White House was decidedly
the most popular of the candidates
considered in the tabulation. He
outranked the six outstanding
Democratic possibilities and the six
strongest Republicans by a size
able margin.
Over 35 per cent of the electorate
chose to hear fireside chats from
Franklin for the next four yeai's.
Mr. Roosevelt's total vole of con
fidence was more than the combined
vote given the six leading Repub
licans. He steam-rollered G.O.P.
white hope Thomas Dewey by a
two and a half times majority.
Thirty-eight-year-old, moustache
wearing Dewey received only 15 per
cent of the total vote cast in the
Fortune poll. At that he was top
man in the list of Republican aspi
rants.
In Stanford's trial balloon, Dewey
ranked second to Robert A. Taft as
the leading G.O.P. Neither reached
final balloting.

dusting through the na

The survey indicated that the up
per income bracket was extremely
opposed to a third-term and contin
uation of the Rooscveltian policies.
The lower income group backed the
President almost to a man. In "dis
covering" that the middle class were
the deciding factor, Fortune merely
repeated the 8-year-old fact.
One out of every five Fortune
voters desired the repeal of most
of the New Deal measures. Half
that number wished to see the New
Deal develop still further. Stan
ford sentiment, as expressed in the
S.P.U. meeting, wished to see the
New Deal on the skids.

be, "As Stanford goes, so goes
the nation."
But not for some time.
Last week embryo student poli
ticians trooped into the auditorium
of the Education Building. Two
hours later, the meeting over, Stan
ford theoretically rang down the
curtain on President Roosevelt's
third-term hopes.
This morning Fortune magazine
appears with the latest of its
famous nation-wide public opin
ion polls. The results of the can
vass indicate that while a slight
majority of the American electo
rate favors the two-term tradition,
the President was still top-heavy
as the nation's choice for 1940.
Almost half of the electorate voted
thumbs-down on a third-term.
Slightly over 40 per cent were in
favor. And a bit over 9 per cent
didn't give a damn.
In Stanford's S.P.U. open meeting,
Democrat Cordell Hull was the stu
dent choice for the Presidency of
the United States. Mr. Roosevelt
was a poor second. The G.O.P. ban
ner trailed dismally in the dust of
the Farm's Education Building audi
torium.

FORTUNE'S survey in 1936 came
uncomfortably close in its re
sults. It practically hit the political
nail on the head. This year national
crystal gazers are paying a great
deal more attention to Fortune mag
azine and its findings.
This latest poll of theirs put
President Roosevelt in a fairly
comfortable position. Regardless
of third-term prejudices, the man
in the White House was decidedly
the most popular of the candidates
considered in the tabulation. He
outranked the six outstanding
Democratic possibilities and the six
strongest Republicans by a size
able margin.
Over 35 per cent of the electorate
chose to hear fireside chats from
Franklin for the next four yeai's.
Mr. Roosevelt's total vole of con
fidence was more than the combined
vote given the six leading Repub
licans. He steam-rollered G.O.P.
white hope Thomas Dewey by a
two and a half times majority.
Thirty-eight-year-old, moustache
wearing Dewey received only 15 per
cent of the total vote cast in the
Fortune poll. At that he was top
man in the list of Republican aspi
rants.
In Stanford's trial balloon, Dewey
ranked second to Robert A. Taft as
the leading G.O.P. Neither reached
final balloting.

dusting through the na
tion's favorites for the 1940
nomination, Fortune's poll rolled up
its sleeves and waded into a discus
sion of the New Deal.
The survey indicated that the up
per income bracket was extremely
opposed to a third-term and contin
uation of the Rooscveltian policies.
The lower income group backed the
President almost to a man. In "dis
covering" that the middle class were
the deciding factor, Fortune merely
repeated the 8-year-old fact.
One out of every five Fortune
voters desired the repeal of most
of the New Deal measures. Half
that number wished to see the New
Deal develop still further. Stan
ford sentiment, as expressed in the
S.P.U. meeting, wished to see the
New Deal on the skids.
Almost 40 per cent of these in
cluded in Fortune's poll wished to
at least see Rooscveltian measures
modified considerably.
Various "dark horse" presidential
possibilities were omitted by For
tune in (lie voting on individual
preferences. Most pretentious of
those not mentioned were Demo
cratic Senator Burton K. Wheeler,
and Republican utilities magnate!
Wendell Wilkie.
However, Fortune admittedly j
picked the cream of the 1940 crop. |
As her voters testified when they an
swered "no" to the question: "Can
you name anyone you would prefer j
to any of these six Democrats and j
six Republicans?"
