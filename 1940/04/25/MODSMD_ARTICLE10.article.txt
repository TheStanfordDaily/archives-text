# Dean Bunn Upholds Proposition For Housemothers at Lunch Club
## 
### 
Stating the case for housemothers in fraternities yesterday before
Lunch Club, Dean of Men John Bunn maintained that their installation
in the houses would result in real homes for the boys and would give
fraternity men a mother's attention while they were away from their
own homes.
Lunch Clubbers were surprised at the outset of the talk by Mr. Bunn's

statement that there is now on the
record of the Board of Trustees a
motion providing that there shall be
housemothers in all houses. He also
cited a similar recommendation
made by National Interfratemity
Council.
EDUCATIONAL EFFORT
"Anything we do in a university
should have some educational val
ue," said Mr. Bunn. "The presence
of a lady within a group tends to
create an atmosphere that is not
created by the absence of a house
mother. As you can see, I usually
place a lady on a very high level."
Mr. Bunn then told of talks he
has had with mothers who come to
him with complaints of the bad table
manners and untidy habits their
boys have picked up since living in
fraternity houses. Both of these fea
tures, he maintained, would be elim
inated by the presence of a house
mother.
SEVERAL PLANS
As far as the problems which his
plan presents, he admitted that there
were several. The choice of a wom
an who would be satisfactory in all
respects would not be easy. He rec
ommended someone like Mrs. C. G.
Allen, director at the Men's Rest
Home, as the ideal type for the job.
Another point in favor of house
mothers, according to Mr. Bunn, was
the fact that when alumni came
back to the house the housemother
would be able to welcome them and
they would not feel as strange as
they sometimes do.
"A housemother would create
something .stable, something to
which the alums would return," he
stated.
