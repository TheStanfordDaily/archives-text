# Pepper Explains Architect Trends
## 
### 
Developing the thesis that both
sensual beauty and intellectual in
terest are necessary to art, Dr. Ste
phen C. Pepper explained the cur
rent trend toward functionalism in
architecture in his lecture last, night
in the Education auditorium.
Dr. Pepper, chairman of the art.
department of the University of
California, spoke here under the
auspices of the American Institute of
Architects. His evaluation of mod
ern buildings was illustrated by
slides.
"A work of art is an embodiment
of human interests," Dr. Pepper
maintained, "and reflects the balance
of interests of man." Modern func
tionalism, he explained, covers a
range of interest from pure engi
neering construction to pure deco
ration.
