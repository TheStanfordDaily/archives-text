# Plan to Change Eating Clubs Denied by Bunn
## Presidents of Campo, Toro, Breakers State Opposition to Idea 
### 
An alleged proposal by Stanford's
Dean of Men to reopen Branner din
ing hall with the three independent
eating clubs—Breakers, El Toro, and
El Cainpo—as occupants along with
non-organization members of Toyon
and Branner, yesterday was denied
by John Bunn.
Interest among members of the
three clubs affected was aroused by
statements from their representa
tives at Tuesday night's Interclub
Council meeting, where Dick Meyer
hofT, Council president, assertedly
termed Bunn's suggestions as "a
plan which the Dean intended to put
into operation."
When asked yesterday whether
this constituted an official Adminis
tration policy, Dean Bunn declared:
MERELY AN IDEA
"The suggestion to put the three
independent clubs in Branner was
merely an idea for them to con
sider. If members of these clubs are
opposed, then there is nothing more
to be said."
Interclub representatives of the
independent clubs purportedly un
derstood MeyerhofT to declare that
by Dean Bunn's "proposal" Branner
would be partitioned off into sepa
rate rooms for each of the clubs.
Another section would be for non
club members residing in Toyon
and Branner.
These four partitions would he
served from a community kitchen
under a system similar to the one
now employed on the Encina Com
mons. At present each of the inde
pendent clubs has its own kitchen
facilities.
MISUNDERSTANDING ASSERTED
Dean Bunn claimed yesterday that
he did not possess the authority to
initiate such a plan.
"It would have to come from
President Wilbur," he said.
Interclub Council President Mey
erhofT alleged yesterday that rep
resentatives of Breakers, Campo,
and Toro misunderstood him at the
meeting.
"The move to switch these three
clubs was nothing mere than an
idea advanced by Dean Bunn. It
was not a definite proposal. I am
sorry that I gave any other im
pression."
Presidents of the three clubs in
question expressed "surprise" that
such a proposition had even been
mentioned.
OPINIONS STATED
"If we were to take part in such
a program," s;iid Bob Livingston,
head of El Campo and senior class
president, "we would lose our inde
pendence in the matter of selecting
the cook and hashers we want and
control over disbursement of the
money we pay. Furthermore, it
would constitute a serious loss to
our present freedom."
Wally McDivitt., president of
Breakers, said:
"The value of a club should be
measured by its success. These in
dependent. clubs have been in op
eration for over 27 years under their
present individual programs. That
record speaks for itself, so why
change now."
President of El Toro, Bill Whit
field, expressed pride in the "pro
gressivd|ness and student leader
ship manifested by members of
these clubs since their establish
ment."
"They have been and continue to
be prominent in campus athletics
and politics, as well as in other
school functions and activities," he
added.
