Why was little Audrey late for
class—a whole 2."i minutes? She
rarely comes late (o any class.
The answer—she was wandering
around with little Aubrey in the
library's Hoover \V;ir stacks look
ing for a way out.
Nasty? No. They just got lost
while doing some library research
for a propaganda class. The fe
male librarian forgot them and
went home, so they spent 2.1 min
utes, like babes in the woods,
looking for the end of the maze.
Audrey and Aubrey are their
real names.
