# Bookstore Votes to Pay Five Per Cent Rebates
## Refunds to Be Made on May 15 Inaugurating Return to Old System 
### 
At the meeting of the Board of Directors of the Stanford Bookstore
yesterday, it was voted to pay a rebate of 5 per cent on all purchases
made by students, faculty members, and University employees. The re
bates will be given on all purchases made during the academic year up
to and including May 15.
Rebates are expected to amount to approximately $4,000. Payment

will be made May 27 to those who<
have deposited tags in boxes no later
than May 15. Purchases made after
this date will be included in the
rebates for the coming academic
year.
RUN TO BENEFIT
The store, founded by the late
David Starr Jordan, former president
of the University, is a co-operative
institution run for the benefit of stu
dents, faculty, and University em
ployees. Sharing of profits through
rebates is a part of the plan under
which the store was instituted.
Dr. David E. Faville, president of
the Board of Directors of the Book
store and a member of the faculty of
the Graduate School of Business,
emphasized the attitude of the board
concerning the agitation for payment
of rebate money to the Commission
on Student Aid.
SOME AGITATION
He stated, "From time to time
there has been agitation for the pay
ment of rebate money to the Com
mission on Student Aid and some
students do not want to be bothered
with saving and depositing rebate
tags. While the board can make no
commitment at this time, it ex
pressed itself as favorable to the
payment to the Commission on Stu
dent Aid of a substantial sum from
any remaining profits accruing at the
end of this academic year."
It is estimated that from 50 to 60
per cent of the students making pur
chases at the Bookstore fill out re
bate slips and deposit them in the
boxes. Some of this surplus coming
from those not filling out tags will
probably be given the Commission
on Student Aid. The past few years
no rebates have been given and the
surplus amount has gone for student
aid and scholarship loans.
