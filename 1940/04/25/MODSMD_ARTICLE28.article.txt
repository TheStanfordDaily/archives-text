# Hart Return Aids Frosh Trackmen
## 
### 
Bolstered by the return of Vern
Hart, the Stanford frosh will invade
Edwards Field tomorrow with new
hopes of avenging their overwhelm
j ing defeat of last year when Cal's
! freshmen crushed the Farm year
lings 112 to 19 in track.
That Little Big Meet last spring
; was one of the worst athletic de-
I feats ever suffered by a Stanford
team, the Papooses getting only one
first.
Vith Vern Hart apparently ready
to go after a recent operation, and
the rapid improvement of Zip Walt,
Carl Kellenberger, and others, the
frosh should ring up at least 40
points. A concensus of local dope
, sheets gives Cal about a 79 to 52
! victory.

Production of quick frozen foods
in the United States this year is
expected to total about 480.000
pounds, almost three times the out
put in 1936.
