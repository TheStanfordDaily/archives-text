# Captain of Collegiate Crew Lectures on Hawaiian Voyage
## 
### RUTH RICHMOND 
A color film of a sailing trip that began on lhat day when "the ship
was overrun with weeping mams, proud papas, and desperate sweet
hearts" and wound up by returning Captain Warwick M. Tompkins and
his crew of college-student landlubbers from a 5,000-mile deep water
j voyage, was shown for the Tuesday Evening Series Inst night.

"The only people we were never
able to put to work were the kit
tens," remarked Captain Tompkins
in describing the events of the voy
age aboard the "Wander Bird."
According to Captain Tompkins,
the truest democracy exists on ship
board because the captain holds his
position only because by common
consent he knows more of sailing
than anyone else there and, because
if he didn't listen to the opinions of
his crew, he'd have a mutiny on his
hands.
"Life is not all it's cracked up to
be," he commented of the first three
days when the ship swung up and
down.
Among the members of the crew
on the Hawaiian voyage were four
or five students who are now at
Stanford.
"If there's anything hotter and
stickier and more in the way than a
dozen leis " laughed the captain
from long experience. "It takes 55
gardenias to make a 25-cent lei."
While shattering popular illusions,
1 Captain Tompkins showed pictures of
j the Japanese fishing craft in Hono
j lulu harbor and assured the audience
| that they were not filled with tor
' pedo tubes.
