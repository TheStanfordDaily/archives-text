# Dr. Storey Talks On KGO Tonight
## 
### 
A lifetime adventure in the field
of college hygiene will be recounted
tonight by Dr. Thomas A. Storey,
director of the Stanford University
School of Hygiene and Physical Edu
cation, when he speaks on the Stan
ford radio program over KGO at 8
o'clock.
In his talk on "The Stanford Uni
versity Health Program," Dr. Storey
will paint a verbal picture of the
work and the worry which he and a
staff of trained men and women put
into the task of keeping their 4,000-
odd charges healthy.
Coming to Stanford as a student
in 1892, the year after the Univer
sity's founding, Dr. Storey left his
post as assistant professor here in
1906 to take an intimate part for 20
years in local, state, national, and
international programs of physical
education and school and social hy
giene. Returning in 1926, he became
| supervisor of Stanford's health pro
j gram.
