# Card Weightmen Excel In Big Meet Practice
## Trout, Cornett Turn in Best Marks of Year 
### 
Coach Bill Ellington's weightmen
yesterday served notice to Cali
fornia that they are out to get all
hut two of the possible 18 points
in the shot and discus.
Hefty Bill Trout astounded him
self and his coach by first tossing
the shot 50 feet from a standing
position. Then with a lumbering
hop across the circle soared the shot
out to 51 ft. I 1 â– > in.
Meanwhile over at the discus cir
cle on the Stadium Field where the
Indian tracksters were working out
for their approaching Big Meet with
California, Arnold Cornett hurled
the platter 151 ft. 3 in. for his sea
son's best.
This means that Trout, if he
maintains his present hot streak,
could beat out California's Herb
Michaels for second place behind the
untouchable Stan Andersen, who, by
the way, hit 53 feet again last eve
ning in practice. It also means that
with Cornett constantly improving,
the Indians may be able to grab an
other one-two in the discus with
Andersen again leading the compet
itors.
RECORDS ENDANGERED
Two world records and eight Stan
ford-California meet marks will be
in danger this Saturday when per
haps the strongest aggregation of
Card and Indian cindermen in Big
Meet history will tangle in their
annual dual competition.
Every flat race meet record is li
able to be broken, and with Stan
ford's captain, Clyde Jeffrey, at his
peak, even the world record of 9.4
in the hundred is not safe. Early in
the season at the Long Beach Re
lays, Captain Jeff equaled the world
mark. Though the nearest man to him
at the finish line of the 100 will
probably be his teammate. Ken Bat
taglia, and even though the track
conditions will not be the best pos
sible the pressure of a Big Meet
might push him to a "fastest ever"
time. Jeff will threaten, if not the
world record, certainly the meet
mark of 9.5 in the hundred and his
own time of 20.8 in the furlong.
STILL BETTER
If the Indian relay men feel fresh
enough even after performing once
or twice earlier in the meet, they
may, with a swift Cal team capable
of 3:15 to push them, break then
own world record of 3:10.5.
In the 440 three Stanford men and
one Cal quarter-miler have bettered
the standing mark during this sea
son. The meet record is 48 flat, set
back in 1928 and still standing de
spite the assaults of such famed
runners as Ben Eastman, Archie
Williams, A1 Blackman, Ray Mallott,
and Don Watts. Yet this year all
four of the favored entrants, Bear
Clarence Barnes, and Cards Charlie
Shaw, Ernie Clark, and Craig Wil
liamson may better this long stand
ing time. t
The oldest meet mark still on the
books is in the half mile, which was
lain in 1:53.3 by Bill Richardson of
Stanford back in 1926. This time
also has withstood some mighty fine
runners but ought to fall as a re
sult of that feature race between
Cal's Denzil Widel and Stanford's
Paul Moore.
MARK DOOMED
In the mile run the record was
set last year by Cal's Cecil Cole at
4:15.9. This year with Stan Sadaj,
Ted Vollmer, and Dick Peters per
forming under this mark up at Ber
keley and Paul Moore and Mushy
Girard flirting with 4:12 down on the
Farm, this mark also seems doomed.
Likewise the two-mile record of
9:35.3 turned off by the same Sadaj
last year will probably hit the boards
for little Stan and his teammates,
Vollmer, Charles Coper, and Loren
Mclntyre are down around 9:28.
In the field events the only meet
record which has been bettered this
season by Cal or Stanford competi
tors is the mark of 13 ft. 10 7/7 in.
in the pole vault in which Cal's
Guinn Smtih has done 14 ft. 1 in.
