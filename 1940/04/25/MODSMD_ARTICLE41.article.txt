When Coach Clark Shaughnessy
and his staff aren't mulling over dia
j grams, watching moving pictures of
; last year's football team, and then
I going back to diagrams and strategy
! again, then they're thinking about
how the Indians are going to look—•
! in uniforms, that is—next fall.
In his first series of talks to
alumni and press groups. Coach
Shaughnessy stressed the fact th«t
he would have the safety of his
men foremost in mind. By that
he meant both in refraining from
sending an injured man into a
game and also providing adequate
j equipment to insure his not being
injured in action.

WITH HUGH GALLARNEAU as
| model for a couple of suits which
I various wholesalers have left with
j Jake Irwin at the gym store for
I Coach Shaughnessy to try out, the
' staff previewed a couple of pants,
i jersies, and shoulder guards yester
' day morning.
The pants which Mr. Shaugh
nessy is sold on. because of its
lightness in weight and strength
in fabric, is the airplane linen with
which he says he has experiment
ed in Chicago. Hugh, who put it
j on. said it was (he lightest thing
he's ever worn.
Another thing which has sold our
I coach cn it is the wonderful knee
j and thigh protection the pants of
; fers. Besides that it fits snugly
| around the hips and the chances for
the Stanford opponents' tackling our
! men by grabbing hold of the top of
j the pants has been entirely removed.

Since the B.A.C. has given Coach
Shaughnessy absolute freedom in
picking out next year's equip
ment, you'll probably find the In
dians being one of the friskiest
outfits on the Coast next fall what
with this brand new parapherna
lia offering the player a lot more
freedom in getting around than
last year's uniform.
The shoulder "pads — the kind a
coach 20 years ago probably dreamed
about—are really beauties, but you
I have to be a football player to ap
j preciate the fact that there'll be con
j siderably more protection from them
than any used before.

THE OJAI TOURNEY, one of
I California's most popular for tennis
men, attracts four Starrfords this
week-end. Larry Dee, who upset
Bob Peacock, No. 1 netter of Cal,
! in their first meeting two weeks ago,
! and Jim Wade will be the varsity
: men making the trip. Of the frosh,
| Chuck Hutcheson and Tom Krueger
| will compete.
Then the following week, both
Dee and Wade will represent
Stanford in the Pacific Coast quali
fying tourney for the N.C.2A. to
be held at U.C.L.A.'s Westwood
courts. Winners will he eligible
to compete in the nationals at
| Philadelphia.
The doubles team of Dee and Wade
I also boasts a surprising doubles vic-
I tory over that top duo of Peacock
; and Harmon of Cal. and undoubt
i edly will make a strong showing if
j they get into the competition in the
i East.

IF THIS WEATHER keeps up its
! mid-winter showing, then the Sta
' dium where the Bears and Indians
! will have their track meet Saturday
i will really live up to its name as a
wind-tunnel.
Every race from the 100 to the
410 and to the high and low hur
dles will he run into the face of
the wind which swoops down the
straightaway. That'll mean slow
times, of course.
After a week's work of clearing
I the weeds off the track and lots of
J work leveling the surface, the track
j really isn't in bad condition. If it
| were kept up it would be one of
the fastest, but the wind lets it out.
The B.A.C. should keep in mind,
however, that Angell Field still
needs bleachers and that with
enough seats to handle the ordi
nary crowds, (hat field will make a
better site for either the Big Meet
or the Tropan meet.
