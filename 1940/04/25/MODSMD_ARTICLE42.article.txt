# Cardinal Diamond Hopes Fade as Bears Trip Troy
## 
### DON SELBY 
Stanford's hopes for a baseball victory over Cal this Saturday in
their final game of the season took an upward hop Monday when the
Indian nine beat U.S.C. <S-7. But tlicy slipped back to normal yesterday
for the Bears turned the same trick Tuesday, downing the Trojans 4-:;.
Now both teams are in the same position they were before their re-

spective games against Troy; and
l Stanford is underdog to Cal. The
j Indian nine is still in last position
in the C.1.8.A. standings, while
their transbay rivals hold down third
i spot.
PROBABLE STARTER
Coach Harry Wolter, hoping for at
least one win over the Bears, will be
; almost certain to send Quentin
"Cootie Thompson to the mound
j when the Indians take the field Sat
urday. The Bears nicked Thompson
j lor 13 hits while winning a 6-0 game
! last Saturday. But Wolter thinks
i that his big pitching ace can and
i will set the Cal batters down in
short order this week.
A factor that may help Coot cop a
j win is the way his teammates feel
i about the game. The Indians, having
j lost the first two games of the series
j to their rivals, will be pressing hard
| to end their season with a victory.
BEARS CONFIDENT
1 he Bears, on the other hand, may
come down Saturday considering the
game more or less of a soft touch in
view of the easy manner in which
they whipped the Cards in the other
| two frays. If they do feel that way
j about the game, an upset may be the
result.
