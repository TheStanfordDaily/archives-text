There'll be a camera prevue of
next fall's U.S.F.-Stanford grid in
augural on the varsity praetiee field
this afternoon. A team of Dons and
a team of Indians will cavort before

The linemen on Coach Clark
Shaughnessy's squad got their first
taste of mass contact work in yes
terday's secret practice, but the
backs were held out of the rough
stuff, practicing ball handling on the
other end of the field. The whole
squad probably won't have a .scrim
mage until next week.
Swede Johansen, who injured his
ankle soon after practice, started
three weeks ago, is still watching
the workouts from the sidelines.

PITTSBURGH. April 24 (UP).â€”
