# "A" for Effort
## 
### 
THE Stanford Bookstore is to be congratulated
for being able to return a 5 per cent rebate
on all purchases made during the current aca
demic year. Further congratulation is due the
governors of that co-operative, however, for
their favorable expression in regard to the pay
ment of additional sums of Bookstore profits to
the Commission on Student Aid.
We can safely assume that the Student Aid
scholarship at Stanford is the most highly re
spected of all such awards because it gives the
poor student his best chance of finishing a four
year college career without hampering his work
in either an academic or an extra-curricular fash
ion. Student Aid is what you might call a prize
for "effort."
Student Aid took a terrific lambasting when
the B.A.C. withdrew its support ($5,000 a year)
because of Atherton trouble and a little later
when the Bookstore group, for several unques
tionably pertinent reasons, announced that they
would no longer support the cause in any great
degree. The B.A.C. edict, while it seemed se
vere on the surface, merely took away funds
formerly tabbed for athletes. What has hurt the
Fund has been the lack of support by the Book
store, an organization which has during the past
five years contributed nearly $25,000 to Student
Aid and loan funds.
With the withdrawal of all but a very few of
the sources of revenue, the Student Aid Com
mission found itself in a conference late in win
ter quarter with no work to do. The spring bawl
out shows no awards whatsoever for this quar
ter although the Commission once stated that
four or five men might win scholarships. In the
first two quarters of 1939-40, 56 scholarships
were given, of which only 16 were to athletes.
At the beginning of April, Student Aid
seemed doomed permanently. The general
campus consensus, as well as that of those who
had been enabled to stay in college, was un
questionably in favor of some method which
would revive the aid.
The Bookstore has now unofficially started the
trend back to Student Aid with its favorable
comment. If they should pass an act whereby
profits in addition to the 5 per cent rebate were
reverted to student aid, it wouldn't be long be
fore interested alumni would fall in line for the
most advantageous of all of Stanford's scholar
ship funds.
The student body can best show its appre
ciation of the Commission's efforts by ear-mark
ing Bookstore deposit tags with "Student Aid"
or destroying the tags altogether. Naturally
enough a good many will probably need their
rebates more than those who might receive the
scholarships. But the average students, those
who use such refunds for quick beers or quick
er scotch and sodas, can help perpetuate a truly
fine project with a little abstinence.
