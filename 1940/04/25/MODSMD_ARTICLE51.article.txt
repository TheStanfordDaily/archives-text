ABOUT the third week of spring quarter, Stan
ford's overloaded activities wheel begins to
spin rapidly and in unpredicted directions.
Even with Excom's coolly planned calendar,
designed to lighten the load and distribute it
over three quarters, spring quarter days are
crammed with drives, programs, appeals, fairs,
carnivals, and assorted devices to empty the
library and alter the Bawlout. Easily the most
worthy of these is the Farm's Convalescent
Home Drive. Its Strawberry Brunch, in addition
to raising money for the cause, is a swell Holly
wood conception of college. And its Work Day
presents Stanford at its best.
Useless adjunct to the Drive, though, is its
culminating Masque Ball. Old-timers will admit
it's failed since the King and Queen contest
was killed. Anything which has lost money con
sistently for two years is no addition to a charity
drive.
It is with marked relief, then, that the campus
learns that there will be no Masque Ball this
year. And, though the Drive may lack its logical
Friday night peak, the Convalescent Home kid
dies will have an extra SISO because of smart
committee action.
A second and equally intelligent proposal has
been tossed out of the chaos of pro and con
action on the Masque Ball. too. That is the sug
gestion to combine the Back to the Farm Week
and its Barn Dance with the Convalescent Home
Drive.
Next year, if student executives act on Ned

Pugh's recommendation, they'll tie together
these two activities. It'll be Back to the Farm
with a financial return.â€”D. H.
