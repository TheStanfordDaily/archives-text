r PHE EDITOR, SIR:
Today I saw a man walking slowly around the
stadium. His dog jumped briskly ahead of him; but
he looked tired, thin, disillusioned. In that same sta
dium thousands had shouted for Tiny because he was
sending Stanford to the Rose Bowl.
His wife had been a friend to many of the players.
The number of players who went to her funeral would
shock you. We allowed him to be kicked out without
even a student body vote.
Don't blame it on the mercenary alumni. An active
student body could have saved him and his wife such
misery. We showed the typical loyalty of a "fair
weather" friend.
