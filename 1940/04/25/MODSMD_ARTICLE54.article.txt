# BULL SESSION
## AND NOT EVEN A SLICE OF LEMON 
### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
r |' , OMATO juice is just chock full of healthful vita
mins. It has any number of life-giving food values.
Its rich red color is tempting to the eye, and who can
deny that cool tomato juice is a delicious morning
drink—pleasing to the tongue and soothing to the
stomach.
But tomato juice is not liquid platinum.
As a matter of fact, a good-sized can of tomato
juice can be purchased for as little as 6 cents —but
not at the Stanford Union Cellar. A glass of tomato
juice can be purchased for 5 cents at any number of
establishments in Palo Alto—but not at the Stanford
Union Cellar. A moderately well-ofT growing boy can
keep himself fit and happy with a steady diet of to
mato juice at most stores —but not at the Stanford
Union Cellar. Union tomato juice is a drink only for
wealthy spendthrifts.
Hearing for three years that the Union is a co
operative enterprise, a non-profit establishment spe
cializing in appetizing, healthful food, I of course as
sumed that the Union's expensive tomato juice must
be of some unparalleled caliber. So I appealed to a
number of wealthy philanthropists for research funds,
to investigate the elysian properties of the Union's red
body-petrol, of which the research fund barely bought
a large glass.

'"PHE report of the chemical analysts whom I em
ployed was most disillusioning, to underestimate
my shattered beliefs. I discovered that Union tomato
juice, aside from its price, possesses properties prac
tically indistinguishable from the properties of other
tomato juices. Tiy as the experts would, they could
find no difference in vitamin content, flavor, aroma,
viscosity, color, or blend. In short, careful investiga
tion unmistakably reveals that Union tomato juice is
just plain old tomato juice, and not worth a cent
more than plain old tomato juice.
Now it immediately occurs to one that further re
search might find comparable facts about some of the
Union's other high-priced dishes—tasty as they are.
To our surprise, it might turn out, for example, that
Union orange juice is not a whit better than orange
juice which is sold less expensively by profit-seeking,
non-co-operative Palo Alto merchants.
This is pure speculation, of course, but what is the
forerunner of all scientific investigation if not specu
lation? As a matter of fact, the Union might well do a
little speculation of its own—considering the size of the
tithes they rake in on tomato juice alone.
For the 15 cents they reap on a large glass they
might even give away free dishes or at least a dozen
Florida lemons.
