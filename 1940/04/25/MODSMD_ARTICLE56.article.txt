# HOUSE MOTHERS
## 
### 
John Bunn, who had a mother, pounded another
nail in his platform to provide every mother's son at
Stanford with a part-time mother hero on the Farm.
A mother, he believes, is a boy's best friend, and
he's trying to fix it so a guy can always have a best
friend around. That seems to me to be making moth
erhood merely a matter of convenience.
The Mechanization of Motherhood, or How to Grow
a Stanford Man.
House Mothers, he says, will make fraternities
neater and sweeter. And make them wear longer.
Personally, I think he's trying to get the Good
Housekeeping Seal of Approval.
