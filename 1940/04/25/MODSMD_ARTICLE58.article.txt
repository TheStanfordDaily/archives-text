Last, year when the English Club put out their
annual Yearbook, it came out. a little late, not until
finals week, and it was tough to sell. Aside from the
fact that an English yearbook doesn't go like the
"Grapes of Wrath" or a sex magazine, the sales on
this one were slow because it was hard to find enough
people at that time to sell it, and because people
weren't on the Quad at very regular hours.
The elub finally got a couple of tourists to sell
the book. The first three or four took a long time
selling. Then they got an idea.
They would show a potential customer the last line
on one page reading . . and Joe was over there
putting up a hell of a fight without his pants when
the woman ..." and then snap the book shut.
To see what happened to the britchesless Joe and
the female, they would have to buy the Iwtok
Several did.
