# 'Oomph' Girl, Garfield Play Usual Roles
## 
### 
"Castle on lln* Hudson" now play
ing at the Stanford Theater.
Whenever plots are scarce at War
ner Brothers, the boys turn to War
den L. E. Lawes. The literary pe
nologist is always good for a story,
though fundamentally they're all
the same; but with all those lovely
gangster types around the lot, the
possibilities of the thing are limit
less.
This time it's John Garfield as the
young toughie with the heart of
gold, and Ann Sheridan as the girl
friend. But don't let the tattered
plot scare you; they got away with
it again. I predict, however, that
the day will come when one of those
movies just won't go over, and then
what will James Cagney, John Gar
field, Humphrey Bogart, Big Boy
Williams, Pat O'Brien, et al. do for
jobs, to say nolhing of Warden
Lawes for pin-money?
A CHESTNUT AGAIN
It seems that there was a tough
guy who* got sent up the river. His
girl was faithful. Up at Sing Sing,
the guy didn't get along so well, be
cause he couldn't understand that
he was just one of the boys now.
Then the faithful girl was badly
injured in an automobile accident
and the warden let the guy out on
his honor so he can go and see her.
While he was visiting the girl, a
slimy character who had been both
ering her came in; there was a
fight; she shot him; the tough guy
took the blame, gave himself up,
and died like a gentleman.
It's the performances that make
this movie worth killing time with.
Garfield's never given a bad per
formance, to my knowledge, and
he's had some pretty poor material.
It's nice to see him away from the
Lane sisters at any rate.
NO MORE 'OOMPH'
Ann Sheridan had apparently de
cided to junk the "omph" in favor
of a little acting, and, it turns out,
she actually car? act. In a secondary
part, Burgess Meredith plays a col
lege man in prison, using the most
of his considerable talent.
The warden is Pat O'Brien, and it
seems to me that he was miscast,
though he does an excellent job.
Any number of actors, who really
needed the work, could have taken
over the part, however. Big Boy
Williams is excellent as a delinquent
moron.â€”Nowell
