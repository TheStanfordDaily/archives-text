## Farm Enrollment Will Validate Plan 
### 
Palo Alto Flying School has been
selected as one of three air schools
in the United States to train stu
dents in the new "fool-proof" air
planes, it was announced yesterday
by Harry White, airport manager.
"This authorization from the Civil
Aeronautics Authority will not he
valid unless 20 Stanford students,
physically and scholastic-ally eligible,
enroll for the experimental training
course today," Mr. White said.
The course will consist in the same
program stipulated in the usual
Civilian Pilot Training, with the ex
ception that students will undergo
the rudimentary instruction in the
fixed-rudder aircraft. Thus, when
the novices take over the regular
planes, their early training will have
been more thorough because of the
greater safety element of the new
planes, Mr. White pointed out.
"If this training course proves
that students learn more quickly and
efficiently in these "fool-proof"
planes, and with greater safe'ty and
ease," White said. "They will be
adapted by the C.A.A. for their fly
ing instruction program."
So far this year 10,750 students
have enrolled in the 474 training
schools throughout the country, the
first year in the C.A.A.'s five-year
program intended to instruct nearly
100,000 college students how to fly.
Other air schools, besides Palo
Alto, which were chosen to demon
strate the "fool-proof" planes in a
training course, are Purdue Univer
sity Air School, Indiana, and Parks
School of Aviation at the University
of Alabama, Tuscaloosa.
