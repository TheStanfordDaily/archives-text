### WILSON CANNON 
JIORACE GREELEY'S advice to
young gentlemen to proceed in
a westerly direction seemingly ap
plies to the United States Nuvy.
One prominent Rear Admiral, at
any rate, is all for it.
Speaking early this week before
the Senate Naval Affairs Committee,
Rear Admiral Joseph K. Taussig ex
pressed the personal opinion that
America is the eventual jackpot that
Japan is playing for.
Mr. Taussig was promptly
jumped upon hy his superiors.
Namely, Charles Edison, Secre
tary of His Presidency's Navy.
The Secretary administered a coy
spank to his Hear Admiral when
lie told press reporters that "Taus
sig was expressing only his own
views."
Admiral Joe made no bones about
the fact that the story he was tell
ing was purely his own. And not
(hat of the United States Navy (God
bless 'em). But he was equally firm
in his stand that westerly concen
tration should become a naval ne
cessity.
He has some convincing ideas.
Jittery Admiral Taussig believes
war between America and the Em
pire of Japan, inevitable unless the
United States successfully blocks
Japanese ambitions in the Orient.

JJJE quoted as proof a Japanese
"scrap of paper" now over 10
years old. The paper was a memo
randum to Emperor Hirohito from
Japanese Premier Tanaka. Specif
ically, it stated that Japan first "must
crush the United States" before its
career of world dominance could be
realized.
(This well known document is
generally pooh-poohed in official
circles. Taussig is not so sure.)
The Admiral seriously opposed
America's present policy of seem
ingly attempting to get out of the
Far East.
"We gotta lay oIT that stuff," he
said in effect.
He believes if Japan can ren
der China impotent, she intends to
hoist her banners over the Phil
ippines, French Indo-China, Aus
tralia, and the Dutch East Indies.
The next objective, he murmur
red. would Im* the United Stales,
as a springboard to world suprem
acy.
The United States can forestall
this urogram, he said, by building
h navy so strong that Japan could
never touch it. The wiry, out
spoken little Admiral also suggested
American fortification of Guam and
the Philippines.
The little Admiral appeared a bit
unthinking to several American cor
respondents — who also were out
spoken in their opinions of Taussig's
reasoning.

ONE0 NE pointed out that if Taussig's
reasoning is correct, Japan
would find the American spring
board a tough one to reach. Before
Japan finished her earlier objec
tives, she would be forced to cope
with France, the British Empire, and
what resistance the Dutch could
muster.
A sizeable job. Even for the Japa
nese military caste.
Several of the Admiral's sugges
tions, however, were listened to at
tentively by members of the Senate
committee.
One was a showdown with Japan
over whether she is secretly forti
fying mandated islands in the Pa
cific. The land of the rising sun has
refused to discuss this subject. Thus
naval fears for Guam and the Phil
ippines.
Don't underestimate the Japa
nese navy," he warned broadly.
That the American navy, al
though refusing to officially okeh
or condemn Taussig's views, is not
underestimating anything, was
shown at a little naval party in
the Hawaiian Islands last week.
Almost 160 American heavy naval
vessels were engaged in maneuvers
in Lahaina Roads oIT the coast, of
the island of Maui. The movement
represented the largest mass con
centration of naval vessels in the
history of the United States.
