# Stanford Track Team Favored Over Cal in Meet Tomorrow; Cards Depend On ‘Cripples’
## ‘Question Mark' Mush Girard Will Compete 
### CHUCK SMITH 
A powerful Stanford track team,
sprinkled with world record
breakers, will go out tomorrow
on the Stadium track to beat a
last-developing California outfit
for the first time in three years.
Dependent upon the performances
of several recuperating stars, Coach
Bill Ellington's team is favored to
beat the Golden Bear cindermen for
the first time since 1937. In fact The
Daily s dope sheet has picked the
Cards to turn back their rivals from
Berkeley by a 78-53 margin which
is admittedly optimistic.
Yet if a few of the tracksters that
are just returning to the squad after
layoffs caused by injuries can ap
proach even approximately their
earlier season form, the margin of
the meet may be easily even greater.

Ellington is depending on Mushy
Girard to have completely shaken
that cramped muscle that laid him
low at the end of last week and to
come through for a first or a second
in the mile, with his teammate Paul
Moore taking the alternative spot.
Then a pwir of good flights of hur
dles by Sid 11.yes will do a !<■' to
help the Indian cause. Sid twisted
an ankle three full weeks ago and
will not have run a race until he
takes to his marks for the highs to-#
morrow. But Sid may be called a
"natural'' and ought to cut in for
at least a couple of thirds and don't
j be surprised if he docs even better.
I QUESTION MARKS'
In the broad jump the Indians
have two more "question mai k"
boys. Ihey are Ray Blown and
Thor Peterson. Ray seems always to
be out with a sore leg or twisted
joint but in the past has been able
to pull himself together in time to
take some valuable points in an im
portant meet. Thor is also l-ecuper
ating from a sore leg, and these two
jumpers mean 4 points for Ellington
if they perform up to par.
Every Big Meet, with its come
through performances and tough
competition, is, in the final analysis,
as unpredictable as the wind. Like
wise tomorrow's meet will be won
by the team whose runners arc able
to stand up under the pressure of a
large crowd and plenty of compe
tition, for there are certainly going
to be some mighty close races.
Take for instance the opening
j event, the mile. If Cal's coach, Bru
tus Hamilton, chooses to enter his
other distance ace, Ted Vollmer, as
well as Stan Sadaj and Dick Peter
in the four-lapper, as he did against
' U.S.C., look out for the fireworks.
| Even if Girard is in the best of
I shape, he and his buddy Moore with
| their best times of 4:12 will have to
I ramble to keep ahead of this trio of
Bears who are capable of 4:15 or
better.
CLOSE 140
Then that 440 is going to give some
| judge a bad headache. The four top
entrants, Cal's Clarence Barnes and
Stanford's Ernie Clark, Craig Wil
liamson. and Charlie Shaw have all
run within half a second of each
other at their best. This means that
tliese lour will be bunched into
about five yards at the finish and it
will bf l a tough job sorting them out.
r J he high hurdles, with the ever
present danger of hitting one of
those timbers, are always a thriller.
Dick Simpson ought to come home
but it may be nip and tuck between
Hayes and Bears Mel Long and Don
Pooley for second place.
Little Denzil Widel, who startled
the fans with a 1:53.4 half-mile
when he beat U.S.C.'s Reading a
week ago. will be gunning for world
record holder Paul Moore. If Paul
can come back after running a first
or second in a mile that threatens
to be around 4:12 or 4:13 and win
the half from this little Bear speed
merchant, he will be a true cham
pion.
Again in the low hurdles Simpson
has the class but second place will
be a jumble and another close one
to call. And if the meet should
tighten up and th" outcome should
depend upon the relay, it will be
worth the admission alone to watch
the Indians' world record holding
quartet spin through their laps
when they have a real reason to run.
In the field events there are more
situations for come-through per
formances. Stan Andersen is a cinch
in the shot but his teammate, Bill
Trout, due to his recent hot streak,
threatens to move up to second place
behind Andy, beating out the fa
vored Herb Michaels of Cal.
Andersen, though his season's best
mark doesn't quite rival that of
Cal's Barney Wolf, has a fine chance
of being a double winner tomorrow.
And in the discus it Ls Arnold Cor
net L who is in the position to upset
the dope and sneak in for a share of
points for the Cards.
Whether or not Stanford's Bob
Stone can live up to the prediction
of second place made by The Daily
remains to be seen. Bob is consistent
at around the 200-foot mark while
the Bear tossers, George Fink and
Martin Biles, are at .present both
ered by sore arms and are rather
erratic even while normal.
Jim Lincoln, who has just been
returned to Ellington's fold after a
siege with the books, will help the
unpredictable Russ Wulfl in the high
jump. These two have the stuff, and
if they are on, ought to take the
majority of points from their com
petition, Mel Long and Guinn Smith.
