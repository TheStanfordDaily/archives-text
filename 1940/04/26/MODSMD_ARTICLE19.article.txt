# Stanford Track Team Favored Over Cal in Meet Tomorrow; Cards Depend On ‘Cripples’
## ‘Question Mark' Mush Girard Will Compete 
### CHUCK SMITH 
A powerful Stanford track team,
sprinkled with world record
breakers, will go out tomorrow
on the Stadium track to beat a
last-developing California outfit
for the first time in three years.
Dependent upon the performances
of several recuperating stars, Coach
Bill Ellington's team is favored to
beat the Golden Bear cindermen for
the first time since 1937. In fact The
Daily s dope sheet has picked the
Cards to turn back their rivals from
Berkeley by a 78-53 margin which
is admittedly optimistic.
Yet if a few of the tracksters that
are just returning to the squad after
layoffs caused by injuries can ap
proach even approximately their
earlier season form, the margin of
the meet may be easily even greater.

Ellington is depending on Mushy
Girard to have completely shaken
that cramped muscle that laid him
low at the end of last week and to
come through for a first or a second
in the mile, with his teammate Paul
Moore taking the alternative spot.
Then a pwir of good flights of hur
dles by Sid 11.yes will do a !<■' to
help the Indian cause. Sid twisted
an ankle three full weeks ago and
will not have run a race until he
takes to his marks for the highs to-#
morrow. But Sid may be called a
"natural'' and ought to cut in for
at least a couple of thirds and don't
j be surprised if he docs even better.
I QUESTION MARKS'
In the broad jump the Indians
have two more "question mai k"
boys. Ihey are Ray Blown and
Thor Peterson. Ray seems always to
be out with a sore leg or twisted
joint but in the past has been able
to pull himself together in time to
take some valuable points in an im
portant meet. Thor is also l-ecuper
ating from a sore leg, and these two
jumpers mean 4 points for Ellington
if they perform up to par.
Every Big Meet, with its come
through performances and tough
competition, is, in the final analysis,
as unpredictable as the wind. Like
wise tomorrow's meet will be won
by the team whose runners arc able
to stand up under the pressure of a
large crowd and plenty of compe
tition, for there are certainly going
to be some mighty close races.
Take for instance the opening
j event, the mile. If Cal's coach, Bru
tus Hamilton, chooses to enter his
other distance ace, Ted Vollmer, as
well as Stan Sadaj and Dick Peter
in the four-lapper, as he did against
' U.S.C., look out for the fireworks.
| Even if Girard is in the best of
I shape, he and his buddy Moore with
| their best times of 4:12 will have to
I ramble to keep ahead of this trio of
Bears who are capable of 4:15 or
better.
CLOSE 140
Then that 440 is going to give some
| judge a bad headache. The four top
