###

acted to insulate the United States
from the extension of the war into
Scandinavia.
In a series of executive proclama
tions, Mr. Roosevelt invoked full
powers of the United States neu
trality law, extended "cash and
carry" regulations to Norway, and
prohibited use of American ports or
territorial waters to submarines of

ers of the neutrality law today in

control of which the Nazis might
obtain by military action.
