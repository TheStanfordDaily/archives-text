### 
VANCOUVER, Wash., April 25
(UP). The Greek-owned steamer
Penelopi sailed from Vancouver to
night, after dismissal of a writ of
habeas corpus cleared the way for
the vessel to depart for Vladivostok
with six protesting alien seamen
aboard. All of the men feared death
or imprisonment in the Soviet port.
