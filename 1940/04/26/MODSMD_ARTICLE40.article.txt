### FRANK GUTHRIE 
The weather hasn't looked as if it's
g ling to let up, but the predictions
a e that there'll be a Big Meet ta
rt orrow in the Stadium. And besides
hi the 20 years that Don Lieben
d >rfer, the B.A.C. publicity direc
t< r, has been around here, he has
nover known of rain spoiling the Big
Meet ... so on with the show.
Just to keep the records straight,
this department has boldly as
serted that the 17th meeting of
Stanford and Cal will go to the
Farm only when Cap'n Clyde Jef
frey has romped home winner in
the mile relay. My score has it
70-61.
Probably one reason why Stan
f< rd hasn't won a Big Meet in three
years is that the dopesters don't
p edict our Indians to win by at
least 10 points. In 19158 and 1939, the
meet was a toss-up on paper and
yvt the Bears won by almost identi
c; 1 scores, 75 to 56 and 74' •> to 5G'-j.
In 1937 we won, 77 1 '< to 53

JUST TO SHOW how Stanford
his improved in a year's time, take
a look at last year's "bests" prior to
t ie Big Meet:
Jeffrey had a 9.6 "hundred,"
but he's down to 9.4 now; Craig
Williamson is down to 47.5 from
1X.9 in the quarter - mile (and
Clarence Barnes, the Cal one-lap
ace, was doing 49.6 last year, but
Saturday did 47.9); Paul Moore
and Mush Girard had bests of 1.58
and 1:54 last year—today it's un
der 1:53 for both, although Mush
won't run tomorrow.
In the mile Mush had run a 4:18,
but ran under 4:13 against Ucla.
Moore wasn't even listed, although
he had run about 4:21, where today
he holds the Stanford record at
4:12.0. Dick Simpson was only a
14.9 runner in the highs last year—
it's 14.0 now; while we have no
check on Sid Hayes' 1940 time, he
did 14.5 a year ago. Dick just did
24 flat in the lows but has done 23.8
this year.
Stan Andersen was up to 52.8
in '.'59 and now is over 53 feet,
while Bill Trout was only a 47-
f(Miter last year hut did 51:14
Wednesday; Andj throws the dis
cus 155 feet as compared to 136,
and Ainie Cornell has a 150-foot
toss to compare with last year's
135; Bob Stone was so ill-thought -
of last year he wasn't ev< n listed
in the javelin, but he's over 200
now; high jumpers Russ WuIlT
and Jim Lincoln are about where
they were last year at 6:5: Bob
Kenyon was doing 13 feet before
being injured last year just be
fore the Big Meet hut has done
13:6 this year; our relayers were
jogging around in 3:19 last year—

what's it now? oh, yes, 15:10..'—
a new world's record.
And don't forget that a lot of that j
! improvement is due to masterful ;
handling by Bill Ellington, who be- j
sides getting better times out of last i
year's veterans has brought out a ;
few stars like Charley Shaw, Ken j
! Battaglia, Thor Peterson, Jack !
: Moore, Ernie Clark, Burman Skr- j
\ able, Blair Hyde, to name only a j
j few.

tomorrow. The diamondmen have I
already lost the series, but with i
Cootie Thompson making his third |
straight stand against 'em (and if |
you want to take a chance that the
j boys will hit for him as they did
j against Troy this week) then the
j chances are the Farm will salvage
one game at least from the second
place Bears.
Swimmers, although second in
the P.C.C. extravaganza last week,
will be battling to keep the Bears
in 21 years from Stanford. It'll be
from winning their second meet
in the morning, so come out to

swings into action this afternoon

fact that Jack Weierhauser's boys
are going down to sure defeat, there
I are a couple deserving of some at

Bob Smith is running around

a year or two he'll be around 47.5
or so. if our guess doesn't go

Probably one reason why Stan

JUST TO SHOW how Stanford

Moore wasn't even listed, although
he had run about 4:21, where today
he holds the Stanford record at
4:12.0. Dick Simpson was only a
14.9 runner in the highs last year—
it's 14.0 now; while we have no
check on Sid Hayes' 1940 time, he
did 14.5 a year ago. Dick just did
24 flat in the lows but has done 23.8
this year.
Stan Andersen was up to 52.8

JUST TO SHOW how Stanford
his improved in a year's time, take
a look at last year's "bests" prior to
t ie Big Meet:
Jeffrey had a 9.6 "hundred,"
but he's down to 9.4 now; Craig
Williamson is down to 47.5 from
1X.9 in the quarter - mile (and
Clarence Barnes, the Cal one-lap
ace, was doing 49.6 last year, but
Saturday did 47.9); Paul Moore
and Mush Girard had bests of 1.58
and 1:54 last year—today it's un
der 1:53 for both, although Mush
won't run tomorrow.
In the mile Mush had run a 4:18,
but ran under 4:13 against Ucla.
Moore wasn't even listed, although
he had run about 4:21, where today
he holds the Stanford record at
4:12.0. Dick Simpson was only a
14.9 runner in the highs last year—
it's 14.0 now; while we have no
check on Sid Hayes' 1940 time, he
did 14.5 a year ago. Dick just did
24 flat in the lows but has done 23.8
this year.
Stan Andersen was up to 52.8
in '.'59 and now is over 53 feet,
while Bill Trout was only a 47-
f(Miter last year hut did 51:14
Wednesday; Andj throws the dis
cus 155 feet as compared to 136,
and Ainie Cornell has a 150-foot
toss to compare with last year's
135; Bob Stone was so ill-thought -
of last year he wasn't ev< n listed
in the javelin, but he's over 200
now; high jumpers Russ WuIlT
and Jim Lincoln are about where
they were last year at 6:5: Bob
Kenyon was doing 13 feet before
being injured last year just be
fore the Big Meet hut has done
13:6 this year; our relayers were
jogging around in 3:19 last year—

what's it now? oh, yes, 15:10..'—
a new world's record.
And don't forget that a lot of that j
! improvement is due to masterful ;
handling by Bill Ellington, who be- j
sides getting better times out of last i
year's veterans has brought out a ;
few stars like Charley Shaw, Ken j
! Battaglia, Thor Peterson, Jack !
: Moore, Ernie Clark, Burman Skr- j
\ able, Blair Hyde, to name only a j
j few.

already lost the series, but with i
Cootie Thompson making his third |
straight stand against 'em (and if |
you want to take a chance that the
j boys will hit for him as they did
j against Troy this week) then the
j chances are the Farm will salvage
one game at least from the second
place Bears.
Swimmers, although second in

GROVER KLEMMER. the sensa-|

swings into action this afternoon
against our yearlings. Despite the
fact that Jack Weierhauser's boys
are going down to sure defeat, there
I are a couple deserving of some at
j tention as potential Stanford greats.
Bob Smith is running around
50.5 in the quarter-mile, and in
a year or two he'll be around 47.5
or so. if our guess doesn't go

the sprinter and others. Taking

the next three years will be a

hi the 20 years that Don Lieben

t< r, has been around here, he has
nover known of rain spoiling the Big
Meet ... so on with the show.
Just to keep the records straight,
this department has boldly as
serted that the 17th meeting of
Stanford and Cal will go to the
Farm only when Cap'n Clyde Jef
frey has romped home winner in
the mile relay. My score has it
70-61.
Probably one reason why Stan
f< rd hasn't won a Big Meet in three
years is that the dopesters don't
p edict our Indians to win by at
least 10 points. In 19158 and 1939, the

GROVER KLEMMER. the sensa-|
tional Cal frosh quarter - miler, I
swings into action this afternoon
against our yearlings. Despite the
fact that Jack Weierhauser's boys
are going down to sure defeat, there
I are a couple deserving of some at
j tention as potential Stanford greats.
Bob Smith is running around
50.5 in the quarter-mile, and in
a year or two he'll be around 47.5
or so. if our guess doesn't go
askew. Then there's Dick Scott
the sprinter and others. Taking
care of our weight department
the next three years will be a
husky 200-pounder. Ed Stamm,
who's already made letters in
football and basketball.
