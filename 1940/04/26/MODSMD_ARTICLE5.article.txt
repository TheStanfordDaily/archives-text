# Excom Acts On Amendment
## Proposal to Change Election Qualifications 
### 
An A.S.S.U. constitutional amend
ment providing that candidates for
student body offices must be Stan
ford students will be on the first
general election ballot next fall, ac
cording to action taken this week
by Ex Committee.
John Porter, chairman of a sub
committee, reported an amendment
rather than a by-law will be neces
sary, since a by-law cannot add
qualifications to the constitution.
As it stands now, the constitution
provides that only Stanford students
shall be eligible "to hold A.S.S.U.
or class offices." The amendment
would change this section to read
". . . to be elected to or to hold
class offices."
The change first was suggested
when it was found that Student
Body President-elect Bruce Jessup
had to register in the University to
run for that office, in order to con
form to a University ruling.
The new amendment would bring
the constitution into line with the
University ruling.
