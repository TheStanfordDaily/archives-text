# Diz Dean's Curves Win Cub Victory
## 
### 
NEW YORK, April 23 (UP).â€”
Dizzy Dean, the greatest one-man
how in base I,all, whose form until
today had impressed no one but
Dizzy Dean, showed that he may
again become a winning moundsman.
He pitched the Chicago Cubs to a
4-2 victory over the Cincinnati Reds.
While Ol' Diz exhibited nothing
approximating his former effective
ness, he d:d set back the 1539 cham
pions with five' stingy hits to report
his first win of the season. He had
little speed, relying almost entirely
on his curve and slow ball. But his
canny knowledge of pitching
brought him victory after a rough
inning when the Reds scored both
their runs on one hit and two errors.

States number 993,022.
