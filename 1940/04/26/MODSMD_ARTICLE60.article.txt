# Neutrality
## 
### 
THE one important thing which got the United
States into World War I was an inability
to maintain strict neutrality in 1914 and 1915.
Various forces assaulted our neutrality, but one
of the most powerful was the force of "out
raged" public opinion.
It is now beginning to look as though America
is either unable or unwilling to learn the ob
vious lesson that 1914 and 1915 should have
taught us. It is beginning to look as though
America is catching the psychological fever that
ends in the disease of war.
No better examples of that fever can be
found than in the recent diplomatic outbursts
of an esteemed admiral, a rich ambassador, and
a punch-drunk lawyer for the National Labor
Relations Board. Their theories were something
as follows:
Said the first, The United States will be at
war with Japan in four months. In six months
after the close of the European struggle, this
esteemed intellectual claims, the United States
will be at war with Germany because these
Terrible Teutons will have attacked several
South American countries, in direct violation
of the Monroe Doctrine.
Said the second, the moral responsibility of
the United States is unquestionably with the
Allies, that conglomeration of idealistic, honor
able, and altruistic nations that demands noth
ing more than a nine-tenths to one-tenth split
when the world is divided into segments.
Said the third, the moral traditions of this
country are with England and the Christian re
liigion, which Hitler is trying to destroy, and
with the traditions of the freedom and the dig
nity of men. "We have fought for freedom in
the past," he says, "and we will fight for it
again.
"We will fight for it so long as we are free
men,"
This third man, in our estimation the worst
enemy of peace of the trio, also claimed that
the Nazi propaganda was trying to paralyze
the moral driving force of the American people.
It is unfair in every sense of the word to say
that the United States should fall in line behind
such a tremendously powerful and surprisingly
effective propaganda as that of the Allied
powers.
For America to pick out the German nation
as the obvious aggressor nation in the present
war and for us to declaim their every objective
as something immoral and distressing is the
goal of most propaganda being offered by the
Allies.
We in America are not about to die. If Amer
ica ever records herself in history for any one
achievement, perhaps it can be the boast that
we knew that war was futile, that war itself
was nothing but a deliberate and fortunately
an obvious atrocity.
We in America cannot be expected to know
much about the present conflict in Europe. The
propagandists and the agitators on both sides
have made certain of that. The only thing about
which we can be certain is the fact that we lost
three things: money, men, and self-respect in
the first world conflict.
So if there is no certainty about World War 11,
if neither you, nor I, nor God himself can ap
portion the blame for starting and continuing
this awful holocaust, isn't it better for us to keep
our blamed mouths shut in a spirit of absolute
neutrality, and hope for a quick end—without
the aid of the United States—to the current
struggle?

THE one important thing which got the United
States into World War I was an inability
to maintain strict neutrality in 1914 and 1915.
Various forces assaulted our neutrality, but one
of the most powerful was the force of "out
raged" public opinion.
It is now beginning to look as though America
is either unable or unwilling to learn the ob
vious lesson that 1914 and 1915 should have
taught us. It is beginning to look as though
America is catching the psychological fever that
ends in the disease of war.
No better examples of that fever can be
found than in the recent diplomatic outbursts
of an esteemed admiral, a rich ambassador, and
a punch-drunk lawyer for the National Labor
Relations Board. Their theories were something
as follows:
Said the first, The United States will be at
war with Japan in four months. In six months
after the close of the European struggle, this
esteemed intellectual claims, the United States
will be at war with Germany because these
Terrible Teutons will have attacked several
South American countries, in direct violation
of the Monroe Doctrine.
Said the second, the moral responsibility of
the United States is unquestionably with the
Allies, that conglomeration of idealistic, honor
able, and altruistic nations that demands noth
ing more than a nine-tenths to one-tenth split
when the world is divided into segments.
Said the third, the moral traditions of this
country are with England and the Christian re
liigion, which Hitler is trying to destroy, and
with the traditions of the freedom and the dig
nity of men. "We have fought for freedom in
the past," he says, "and we will fight for it
again.
"We will fight for it so long as we are free
men,"
This third man, in our estimation the worst
enemy of peace of the trio, also claimed that
the Nazi propaganda was trying to paralyze
the moral driving force of the American people.
It is unfair in every sense of the word to say
that the United States should fall in line behind
such a tremendously powerful and surprisingly
effective propaganda as that of the Allied
powers.
For America to pick out the German nation
as the obvious aggressor nation in the present
war and for us to declaim their every objective
as something immoral and distressing is the
goal of most propaganda being offered by the
Allies.
We in America are not about to die. If Amer
ica ever records herself in history for any one
achievement, perhaps it can be the boast that
we knew that war was futile, that war itself
was nothing but a deliberate and fortunately
an obvious atrocity.
We in America cannot be expected to know
much about the present conflict in Europe. The
propagandists and the agitators on both sides
have made certain of that. The only thing about
which we can be certain is the fact that we lost
three things: money, men, and self-respect in
the first world conflict.
So if there is no certainty about World War 11,
if neither you, nor I, nor God himself can ap
portion the blame for starting and continuing
this awful holocaust, isn't it better for us to keep
our blamed mouths shut in a spirit of absolute
neutrality, and hope for a quick end—without
the aid of the United States—to the current
struggle?
