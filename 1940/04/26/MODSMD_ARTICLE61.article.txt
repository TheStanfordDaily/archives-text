# Flying High
## 
### 
ALMOST everyone is interested in flying
these days, whether it is only the young
c,er next door who builds model airplanes or
r it is the Army and Navy officials bat
/er the respective merits of airplanes
e fleet.
at Stanford over the week-end, flying
its place in the headlines of the day. For
row the Palo Alto Airport will be the com
irea for the Pacific Coast Intercollegiate
ig Meet.
ihe Stanford club is the outstanding inter
collegiate groups of its kind. In the three years
since its conception it has had the Loening
Trophy for two competitions and second place
for the third. This trophy represents the acme
in National Intercollegiate flying and is given
to the club showing the most life, progress, and
skill in flying.
On the Pacific coast, Stanford flying is ace
high. The club has failed to place in events only
once in the three years. This season it has won
the Roos Brothers' Cup, by defeating California,
and the symbolic Hatchet, by figuratively shoot
ing down Southern California.
The fliers receive little in the way of glory
if you would compare them with a football
player or a track star, yet theirs is a sport in

which skill is life and a slip is—well, if you're
lucky, who knows? They really care very little
for inches of newspaper publicity; instead, they
find their glory and thrills where most of us
never will.
But they, like football teams and track teams,
carry the Stanford name, and exemplify the
Stanford code of sportsmanship.
Tomorrow the Stanford Aces will fly again.
We hope not before mythical student eyes but
before real ones.—G. H.
