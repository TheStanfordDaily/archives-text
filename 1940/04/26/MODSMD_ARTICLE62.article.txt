r PHE EDITOR, SIR:
I have read with interest your editorial, '"What
Price Glory?" in the April 19 issue of The Daily. I
quote: "But Hitler is only a man, whose methods
might be distasteful to some but who is no more ab
surd than his French and British enemies." His "meth
ods might be distasteful to some"! "Might be" is a
very tentative expression and "some" implies by no
means the whole or even a majority. Have you ever
really read "Mein Kampf"? All of it—every word?
For until you have you cannot speak with authority.
If you have read it, may I ask if you honestly think
that a citizen of a democratic country, one who be
lieves sincerely in democratic forms and procedures
can find that confession of faith and the present ap
plications of the principles and opinions set forth
therein anything but distasteful? Is there any con
temporaneous document to compare with it?
One of the worst things which can come out of
this war for the citizens of the U.S. is a fiabbiness of
thinking—ihe deplorable result of an attempt to keep
even the balance of the scales; weighing the merits
and demerits of the two sides in the conflict by
placing a finger on the bar whenever it seems in
clined to tip. Don't be afraid to face facts. Nothing
good can come out of war! All right. Nothing good
either can come from shutting your eyes to facts.
You don't have to cheat with the scales in order to
keep this country neutral. If you do we may stay out
of this war but we shall have lost something precious.
Very truly yours,
Christobal Pankhurst
