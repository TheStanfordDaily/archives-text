WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT UNION, ANYWAY?
TV/HAT in the hell is that iron grate in the Union
for?" one of the more direct inhabitants of
the Daily Shack asked.
And there he had me. I couldn't name a single rea
son for having an ugly grocery-store-looking thing
spoiling the Union investment in self-beautification.
"But I can't say so today." I remarked; "I just com
plained about the high price of Union tomato juice
yesterday."
"This is no time to think of variety," the frank one
went on. "As long as you are on the subject of Union
faults, just keep going. You have struck a veritable
bonanza of material."
So here I am—nearly maneuvered into expressing
honest opinions. That iron grate really looks ter
rible.
Ordinarily, whenever one criticizes anything, one
should always be ready to offer a better substitute.
Otherwise one is guilty of destructive criticism, which
dangerously borders on cynicism, sacrilege, or repub
licanism. But in the case of the black iron grate, de
structive criticism is a practical impossibility, because
the absence of a substitute would mean that God's own
vacant air would replace the iron grate. And vacuous
air would certainly be preferable to that Dark-Age
eye-sore.

HPHE list of possible substitutes, however, does not
stop with vacuous air. A brass rail might well be
less offensive than a black grate. Even a window-sec
tion would pass a preference test. And if the Union
officers claim that either of these two alternatives is
too expensive, we have them on two counts: First,
nothing at all is better than the grate. And second,
how can any institution possibly be poor when it
charges a small forlune for tomato juice, not to men
tion orange juice and other vital necessities? It would
take an "F" student in Econ I to answer that question.
And it would take no better than an ambitious "F"
student to make himself a sizeable fortune with toma
to-juice-profits. Given a little luck he might play the
market with his winnings and give Wall Street chills.
Anyhow, he certainly could manage to hire two hus
kies to tear that grate down.
In fact, he might be able to get a few volunteers.
Now, I don't mean to imply that there is nothing
good about the Union. They do lend bridge-decks
free of charge, serve nice chlorinated water, and offer
any number of free paper napkins.
