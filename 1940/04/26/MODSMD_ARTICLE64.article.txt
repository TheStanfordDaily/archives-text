## TO HAVE AND TO HOLD 
### DOUG JAQUES 
First ho thought he would get married at the Senior
Ball during an intermission, or so he tolcl his friends.
"Might get an ice-box out of it," he said. "Get a lot
of junk like that, maybe."
There were protests.
Then he thought he might have it over here in
the Shack. Then he got to thinking how it would be
drinking champagne in this ugly place. Too incon
gruous.
Third choice was the Chapel. He didn't know how
much a wedding there would cost. He went over just
to find out about the price.
He talked with Dr. Trueblood for about half an
hour, and then came back here.
"Well, I'm going to get married in the Chapel June
14," he said. "I wonder how much it's going to cost."
