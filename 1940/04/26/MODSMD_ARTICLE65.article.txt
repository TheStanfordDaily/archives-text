# RUBLE STUFF
## 
### 
A guy had a couple of tickets to the Roble dime-a
dance at the Carnival Tuesday, and then decided what
the hell. What was the use of paying a nickel to dance
with a female from Roble.
He tried to sell them. No takers whatsoever. Then
he tried to give them away. He couldn't; any way he
tried.
Wait until you are sophomores, my dear girls.
(There. I have mentioned the traditional sopho
more slump this quarter. Chances are I will never
have to refer to it again.)
