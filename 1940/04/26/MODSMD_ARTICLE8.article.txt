ing champions, U.S.C., who took the
meet last year at Los Angeles in
sloppy weather.

which involve maneuvers dangerous
to either spectators or pilots, are
aimed to test the pilots' flying preci

point team, high-point man, and the
individual winners in each division.

team, every pilot holding cither a
private or commercial license. The
Trojans will be headed by Captain
Joe Bailey and Cal by J. L. McClel
land. San Diego State Teachers Col

Dick Williams, former president of
the Stanford Flying Club, will be
number one. man on the Indian
team.
Both Cal and U.S.C. are confident
they can beat Stanford with the im
provement they have shown in the
last few weeks.
