APPARENTLY the safest place in
Europe over the week-end was
a nice quiet pill box on either the
Maginot Line or the German West
Wall with nothing other than rou
tine patrol operations to worry
about.
For in Norway the Nazi war ma
chine had scored an amazing coup.
Military observers were astonished
at the German speed and said that
the Allies need reinforcements to
contest the grip the Germans now
have on Norway.
Germany struck in two flanks
during the last week and in spite
of fierce fighting gained control of
two broad valleys, one leading to
Trondheim and the Trondheim
Fjord in the West and the other
to Andalsnes in the East, the Brit
ish port of debarkation. Trond
heim is now in an exposed posi
tion.
The Allies were doggedly cling
ing to a foothold in Norway's
rocky midrift. In addition to the
British infantrymen, the rugged
French Alpine "Blue Devils" were
fighting with light artillery and
planes, attempting to secure bases
and communication for coming re
inforcements before trying to fan
out in a southward offensive.
The occupation of the Trondheim
Fjord and valley because of its im
portance to the fighting on land,
seems to be a task that should have
been undertaken earlier by the
British navy.
In addition to Trondheim, import
ant because of its being a key sea
port and having a large airport, there
are two other cities which are most
important to the Allies.
The British navy appears to be
anxious to enter the fjord and wrest
that vital and vast inland waterway
from the enemy. This may prove to
be a feat equal to some of the great
naval battles of history.
«* * .
r jpilE attacking force, if it intends
full occupation of the fjord, will
include battleships, cruisers, de
stroyers, submarines, and planes,
together with mine sweepers. The
Agdenes Fort is the first obstacle to
lx? crossed. This will be well armed
by Germany and is a key position.
Once the Agdenes Fort is passed, a
sufficiently powerful British naval
force should have little trouble in
reaching all three cities in the fjord.
The success of this naval attack
would give the Allies convenient
localities for the lauding of troops
and heavy military equipment, al
though it must be expected that
the Germans would have destroy
ed port facilities. Suitable air
fields would be gained and they
would not be forced to use the
valuable and vulnerable aircraft
carriers and hastily prepared level
ground for landing planes. Flying
planes from the British Isles to
Norway, where they can be oper
ated only a limited time before re
turning for fuel, is most uneco
nomical and greatly reduces the
Allied air forces available to pro
tect the troops from enemy air
attacks.
Germany attempted to get around
the British fleet by flying troops
over in transports and letting them
bail out in parachutes. The rough
Norwegian terrain has put a hitch in
this plan, together with the sharp
shooting of the Norwegians, who,
like the Finns in the Finnish-Russian
war, seem to have a hatred of these
invaders coming down from the sky.
Also over the week-end Hitler, in
addition to his other pressing du
ties, got around to making an of
ficial announcement —of something
we had suspected was going on any
how that Germany is at war with
Norway.
