# Rugged Life Leads Jenkins To Edit Den
## 
### AMIE REICHERT 
The man who plays God to the
Daily's timid cub reporters sat back,
relaxed, and grinningly asked from
behind a wad of gum, "What d' you
want to interview me for?" Arch
Jenkins, the Stanford Daily's like
able editor, was really behind the
eight ball as he struggled through
his first interview.
He was in the editor's office at
the Shack, a room adorned with a
picture of President Wilbur op
posite a drawing by Petty and last
week's map of Europe. The desk
was cluttered with business-like pa
pers, books, and Arch's feet, nl this
atmosphere he launched upon the
story of his life.
MANY SIDED CAREER
From fire-fighting to news-writ
ing, from a CCC camp to the posi
tion of "Dippy" head man—so reads
his many-sided biography. What a
story Horatio Alger could have
made of Arch's experiences!
Arch spent three and a half years
before entering Stanford in work
ing, traveling, and just bumming
around. He rode freight cars with
bindle stiffs for 11 weeks one sum
mer, touring 25 states—and all at
th unbelievable cost of $2.50. He
slept with the bonus marchers un
der the Washington monument,
worked in a bank, and fought for
est fires for the CCC for a year.
Even now, as though his duties
on the Daily and his studies in Poli
Sci weren't enough to keep him
busy, Arch writes for the San
Francisco Chronicle, works for the
8.A.C., and in his spare time does a
: pretty good job of managing the
| Delta Chi house.
Thus well informed on the cur
rent house-mother controversy,
Arch commented: "House mothers?
You can't put proctors or house
mothers in fraternities if they don't
, want them. It just won't work. But
! if the houses were wiliing. their
I scholarship rating, conduct and ap
pearance would certainly be greatly
improved."
At this point the interview was in
terrupted when Sherm MellinkofT
stuck his head in the door to argue
about the European situation.
When the storm had blown over
Arch resumed talking in his slow,
quiet way.. Asked about row-hall

politics he said: "Though I'm a row
man, I don't believe there's any real |
split at Stanford. The row may have !
its caucus, the halls their's, but in j
the end, the best man wins."
To a query about Bert rand Rus- j
sell s lree love doctrine, the editor 1
arched a whimsical eyebrow and |
philosophized, "No love is free."
His plans for after graduation are 1
quite definite. First he's going to be
married — the girl's from Washing
ton—then he has hopes of a job in I
advertising.
As a parting shot the now thor
oughly exhausted editor assured us
that the frosh reporters don't get
under his feet or in his hair. "I like
the patter of little feet around the '
Shack," he grinned.

From fire-fighting to news-writ
ing, from a CCC camp to the posi
tion of "Dippy" head man—so reads
his many-sided biography. What a
story Horatio Alger could have
made of Arch's experiences!
Arch spent three and a half years
before entering Stanford in work
ing, traveling, and just bumming
around. He rode freight cars with
bindle stiffs for 11 weeks one sum
mer, touring 25 states—and all at
th unbelievable cost of $2.50. He
slept with the bonus marchers un
der the Washington monument,
worked in a bank, and fought for
est fires for the CCC for a year.
Even now, as though his duties
on the Daily and his studies in Poli
Sci weren't enough to keep him
busy, Arch writes for the San
Francisco Chronicle, works for the
8.A.C., and in his spare time does a
: pretty good job of managing the
| Delta Chi house.
Thus well informed on the cur
rent house-mother controversy,
Arch commented: "House mothers?
You can't put proctors or house
mothers in fraternities if they don't
, want them. It just won't work. But
! if the houses were wiliing. their
I scholarship rating, conduct and ap
pearance would certainly be greatly
improved."
At this point the interview was in
terrupted when Sherm MellinkofT
stuck his head in the door to argue
about the European situation.
When the storm had blown over
Arch resumed talking in his slow,
quiet way.. Asked about row-hall

politics he said: "Though I'm a row
man, I don't believe there's any real |
split at Stanford. The row may have !
its caucus, the halls their's, but in j
the end, the best man wins."
To a query about Bert rand Rus- j
sell s lree love doctrine, the editor 1
arched a whimsical eyebrow and |
philosophized, "No love is free."
His plans for after graduation are 1
quite definite. First he's going to be
married — the girl's from Washing
ton—then he has hopes of a job in I
advertising.
As a parting shot the now thor
oughly exhausted editor assured us
that the frosh reporters don't get
under his feet or in his hair. "I like
the patter of little feet around the '
Shack," he grinned.
The man who plays God to the
Daily's timid cub reporters sat back,
relaxed, and grinningly asked from
behind a wad of gum, "What d' you
want to interview me for?" Arch
Jenkins, the Stanford Daily's like
able editor, was really behind the
eight ball as he struggled through
his first interview.
He was in the editor's office at
the Shack, a room adorned with a
picture of President Wilbur op
posite a drawing by Petty and last
week's map of Europe. The desk
was cluttered with business-like pa
pers, books, and Arch's feet, nl this
atmosphere he launched upon the
story of his life.
