# Card Mermen Beat Cal, 39-34 In Upset Win
## Stanford Wins Meet In Final Relay Event; Bears Take Medley 
### HAP EVERETT 
Coach Nort Thornton's great bit of
strategy, a strong come-through per
formance by Pete Okumoto and the
powerful swimming of Roy Vitousek
gave the Stanford's swimming var
sity a stunning upset over Cal, 39-
34, in the annual dual meet Sat
urday morning.
Thornton took Vitousek out of the
breaststroke and the medley relay
to save the big Hawaiian blond for
his first crack at. the 100-yard free
style which he won in the new meet
record time of 52.8. Stanford lost
the medley relay but Lloyd Wilson
came through in the breaststroke for
an Indian first place.
Thornton also cratched Patty from
the 440 to save him for the relay.
Stanford had been favored to win
the medley hands down but the
withdrawal of Vitousek gave the
event to Cal's team of Dam, Kemner,
and Aranson in the winning time
of 3:12.2.
Howie Adams, coast conference
champ, turned in another spectacu
lar diving exhibition with his ankle
still taped to defeat Cal's Barker.
Bill Niccolls, who is improving very
rapidly, took third for the Farm.
Pete Okumoto, middle distance
star, was the real hero of the meet.
The Honolulu boy had already
raced in the 50 and 100-yard free
style events in addition to the med
ley relay but he showed little sign
of being worn out when he gained
10 or 12 feet on his opponent to get
Stanford out ahead in the final event
of the day, the free style relay.
Young, Patty, and Vitousek went
on to win this deciding event and
Stanford won the meet. With Patty
and Vitousek fresh after being
withdrawn from one event, the
strategy of Coach Thornton worked
out just right.
California was unfortunate in that
Marty Lloyd retired from the relay.
The Bears' ace sprinter was too
tired and sick to undertake another
lap. Had he been ready to go, Cal
might have won the meet.
The Stanford frosh won as was
expected with co-captains Bayard
(Doc) Colyear and Don Smith lead
ing the 47-28 victory over the Cal
yearlings. Colyear turned in a
double win in the 220 freestyle and
150 backstroke and topped off his
performance with a fast x'elay lap.

champ, turned in another spectacu
lar diving exhibition with his ankle
still taped to defeat Cal's Barker.
Bill Niccolls, who is improving very

of being worn out when he gained
10 or 12 feet on his opponent to get

out just right.
California was unfortunate in that
Marty Lloyd retired from the relay.

tired and sick to undertake another

might have won the meet.
The Stanford frosh won as was
expected with co-captains Bayard
(Doc) Colyear and Don Smith lead
ing the 47-28 victory over the Cal
yearlings. Colyear turned in a

out just right.
California was unfortunate in that
Marty Lloyd retired from the relay.
The Bears' ace sprinter was too
tired and sick to undertake another
lap. Had he been ready to go, Cal
might have won the meet.
The Stanford frosh won as was
expected with co-captains Bayard
(Doc) Colyear and Don Smith lead
ing the 47-28 victory over the Cal
yearlings. Colyear turned in a
double win in the 220 freestyle and
150 backstroke and topped off his
performance with a fast x'elay lap.
