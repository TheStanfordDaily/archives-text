# Records Fall As Cards Crush Cal
## Cardinal 'Come Through' Performers Turn Meet Into 80½ to 50½ Massacre Indians Smash Two Meet Marks; Jeffrey, Moore, Anderson Double Winners as Stone Stars in Javelin 
### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
Four Big Meet records fell by the wayside Saturday, as Bill Ellington's
powerful Stanford track and field men crushed the University of California
to SO I ■> in the Stanford Stadium.
Surpassing the hopes of even the most optimistic farm rooters, the
Indians hung up new marks in the mile and the mile relay and took twelve
— the possible fifteen first places.

Tlie Stanford upsets started in the
first event with Bob Stone sailing
the javelin 218 feet 2Va inches, a
mark that is 15 feet better than
any of his previous throws. Taking
the cue from Stone, Big Stan An
derson pushed out the shot of 53 feet
B'/2 inches to win and the rout was
on its way.
MOORE SETS RECORD
In the first track event Stanford's
greatest miler, lanky Paul Moore,
loafed to a new meet record in the
sensational time of 4:13.7. He ca: ie
back later in the half mile and v <
going away from California's U>u
Dcnzil Widcl to become o" •
Stanford's three double winners.
Captain Clyde Jeffrey was another
Card double winner, breezing
through the hundred in 9.7 and
then ran the field into the ground
as he pleased in the furlong. Ken
Battaglia of Stanford took second
to the great Jeffrey in both races
and showed a lot of class by being
two strides in back of Jeff in the
century.
In the quarter mile Stanford's two
favorites, Shaw and Williamson,
were ofl form and Ernie Clark step
ped up to the occasion and won the
race leading all the way. Cal's Fay
Froome was a surprise second, mov
ing up in the stretch. Shaw nosed
out his team-mate, Williamson, for
third and Cal's ace, Clarence Barnes,
was lost in the pack.
'CRIPPLE' WINS
The high hurdle race was entirely
an Indian event, with "crippled" Sid
Hayes nipping teammate Dick Simp
son at the tape in the time of 14.9.
In the lows the Card entry, Simp
son, seemed to loaf and Don Pooley
and John Reese of the Bears swept
across the tape in one, two order
and. Simpson took third.
One of the most surprising events
of the afternoon was the broad jump,
with the Cards taking the first two
unexpected places. Leading the
Card jumpers was not Ray Brown,
but an unheralded Norman Chris
tensen who turned in the best jump
ol his career, landing out 23 feet
s' h inches. Following him was foot
baller Thor Peterson, who leaped 23
leet 2Vh inches, beating out Cal's
star and favorite for the event, Han
lon Tharp.
Jim Lincoln proved to be another
Card star as he more than justified
Coach Ellington's prediction that he
would go (J feet 4 inches in the high
jump, by jumping 6 feet 5% inches.
Lincoln was jubilant when he
cleared this height and jumped and
somersaulted all over the turf. Russ
Wull of the Cards also came through
to take second, with third going to
Guinn Smith of the Bears.
CAL WINS SOME
The pole vault and the two-mile
were all California, with the Bears
taking 17of the possible 18 points.
In the two-mile a trio of Bears led
by tiny Ted Vollmer swept the
event with smashing the
meet record with his time of 9:28.5.
Cooper and Mclntyre followed him
across the finish line in that order,
away ahead of the Cards' A1 Soldate.
In the pole vault Guinn Smith
cleared the bar at 14 feet 1% inches,
to set another new meet record.
Nichols of California took second,
with Earl Ford of the Bears and Bob
Kenyon tying for third. The bar
was moved up to 14.5 for Smith but
he barely missed this height three
times.
In the discus, Stan Anderson
came back after winning the shot to
best the favored Barney Wolf of
California on his last throw of 155
feet 2 inches. Wolf took second and
Arnold Cornett came through for
the Cards to take third.
