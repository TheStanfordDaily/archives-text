# Records Fall As Cards Crush Cal
## Cardinal 'Come Through' Performers Turn Meet Into 80½ to 50½ Massacre Indians Smash Two Meet Marks; Jeffrey, Moore, Anderson Double Winners as Stone Stars in Javelin 
### CHESLIE SAROYAN 
Four Big Meet records fell by the wayside Saturday, as Bill Ellington's
powerful Stanford track and field men crushed the University of California
to SO I ■> in the Stanford Stadium.
Surpassing the hopes of even the most optimistic farm rooters, the
Indians hung up new marks in the mile and the mile relay and took twelve
— the possible fifteen first places.

Tlie Stanford upsets started in the
first event with Bob Stone sailing
the javelin 218 feet 2Va inches, a
mark that is 15 feet better than
any of his previous throws. Taking
the cue from Stone, Big Stan An
derson pushed out the shot of 53 feet
B'/2 inches to win and the rout was
on its way.
MOORE SETS RECORD
In the first track event Stanford's
greatest miler, lanky Paul Moore,
loafed to a new meet record in the
sensational time of 4:13.7. He ca: ie

Stanford's three double winners.
Captain Clyde Jeffrey was another
Card double winner, breezing
through the hundred in 9.7 and
then ran the field into the ground
as he pleased in the furlong. Ken
Battaglia of Stanford took second
to the great Jeffrey in both races
and showed a lot of class by being
two strides in back of Jeff in the
century.
In the quarter mile Stanford's two
favorites, Shaw and Williamson,
were ofl form and Ernie Clark step
ped up to the occasion and won the
race leading all the way. Cal's Fay
Froome was a surprise second, mov
ing up in the stretch. Shaw nosed
out his team-mate, Williamson, for
third and Cal's ace, Clarence Barnes,
was lost in the pack.
'CRIPPLE' WINS
The high hurdle race was entirely
an Indian event, with "crippled" Sid
Hayes nipping teammate Dick Simp
son at the tape in the time of 14.9.
In the lows the Card entry, Simp
son, seemed to loaf and Don Pooley
and John Reese of the Bears swept
across the tape in one, two order
and. Simpson took third.
One of the most surprising events
of the afternoon was the broad jump,
with the Cards taking the first two
