# Congress May Adjourn June 1
## Wage-hour Act Fight Resumed by House 
### 
WASHINGTON. April 28 (UP).—
The final session of the 70th Con- j
gress moves into the home stretch j
tomorrow with President Roosevelt
banking on the Senate to stymie
major changes in the New Deal's
labor policies.
With Congress driving for a June 1
adjournment, the House resumes de
bate on proposed revisions in the
wage-hour act. It appeared, on the
basis ol the wide margin by which
revisionists succeeded last week in
parliamentary maneuvers to bring j
amendments to the floor, that the j
House would approve changes in
both the wage-hour and Wagner j
labor laws. But, even if the Senate I
does amend the acts, President Roo
sevelt undoubtedly will veto the
legislation.
Mr. Roosevelt, who returned to
day from a 10-day vacation at Warm
Springs, Ga., meets tomorrow with
his congressional leaders to review
the legislative situation and decide
what remains to be done before
Congress adjourns.
The first order of business for the
Senate this week is consideration of
a bill to "freeze" Norwegian and
Danish credits in this country.
In the House, the wage-hour fight i
reaches the amendment stage of de- I
bate tomorrow. The fight harrowed
to two sets of amendments—the i
Barden and Norton bills—after Rep
resentative Robert Ramspeck, D., i
Ga., announced last week he would
not press for a vote on his measure, 1
originally proposed as a compro
mise.
The federal mint was established
in 1792.
