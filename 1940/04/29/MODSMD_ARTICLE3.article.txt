## Mussolini Will Keep Mediterranean Area Free from Warfare 
### 
PARIS, April 28 (UP).—Premier
Benito Mussolini of Italy has pre
vented two German submarines
based at Majorca in the Spanish Ba
learic Islands from raiding French
shipping in the Mediterranean, ac
cording to a report approved by the
French censor and published today.
The weekly political organ '"Aux
Ecoutes" said that Mussolini has
stubbornly refused to consent to
Germany's use of the submarines to
spread the naval war to the Medi
terranean.
The two submarines, according to
"Aux Ecoutes," have been at Ma
jorca since two weeks before the
outbreak of the European war, hav
ing engaged in German fleet maneu
vers off the Spanish coast last sum
mer, and the Spanish government
has been advised "discreetly" to
order them out of port.
The submarines, it was said, have
not been interned but half of the
German crew of each of them has
been removed and replaced by Span
ish sailors.
The explanation of the govern
ment of Generalissimo Francisco
Franco was said to be that it is not
required to intern the U-boats under
international law because Spain has
an option to purchase them.
French seaplanes fr<sm the port of
Lyautey, important base on the west
coast of French Morocco, l'ecently
were reported to have interrupted
the refueling of a German submarine
by two trawlers a short distance
from the African coast. The French
plane dove down and sank the Ü
bo'at with bombs, it was claimed.
Not a single naval engagement
has occurred within the Mediter
ranean since the start of the war
and the French insist that no Ger
man U-boat has been able to get
past the Allies' anti-submarine bar
riers and nets at Gibraltar.
