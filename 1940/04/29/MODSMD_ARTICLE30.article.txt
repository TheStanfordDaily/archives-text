# Wolf Pitches Frosh Ball Club To 4-2 Victory Over Cal Cubs
## 
### 
Pitching nearly perfect ball, Phil Wolf led the freshman baseball team
to a 4 to 2 victory over the California Bear Cubs Saturday morning on
the Card diamond. Only two hits and two runs in the fifth inning marred
an otherwise perfect game for the Papooses.
Playing an altogether different game from the type played last week

,when the frosh couldn't hit the of
ferings of Bear Pitcher Killibrew,
Stanford secured 10 hits, one of
which was a smashing triple by
left fielder Carl Kellenberger.
The Papooses could have scored
more tallies in the latter part of the
game if it had not been for sloppy
base coaching. Card shortstop Clarke
Graham saved Wolf from having an
other hit chalked up against him by
making a beautiful stop and throw
of a "sure" single in the ninth frame.
A1 Cole's sensational running catch
of a high fly to right field and Ray
Hammett's football catch over his
shoulder of a fly over first were fea
tures of the contest.
Besides getting his triple, Kellen
berger obtained a single to give
himself two hits in three times at
the plate. Oscar Holmes, who
caught in the place of 'Ace Hanlon,
continued his batting spree, getting
two for four. Ted Falasco and
