# Cal Nine Takes Indian Series With Third Win
## 
### HAP EVERETT 
For two years California has had
Cootie Thompson's number and
the last game of the series Satur
day was no exception, for the
Bears solved the big hurler's slants
for a dozen hits and a 6-4 victory
over Stanford, to sweep the 1J)40
Big Series.
Mike Koll pitched his third win
over the Indians although he gave
up ten hits. Cal's southpaw ace was
less effective than he has been in
other games but was coming through
in the clinch.
Stanford got off to a good start
in the first inning. Alter Thompson
had struck out Hoberg with two
away and one on, the Indians scored
a run, Norm Juney's single to left
driving in Monte Pl'yl v/ho had
doubled.
BEARS THREATEN
The Bears threatened Stanford's
slim lead in the second inning when
Cootie walked two men in a row
with only one out. Thompson forced
Griffith to pop up for the second out
but Yockey drove a liner at third
that looked like a sure base hit. Elt
Boone made a spectacular dive to
spear the drive and cut off the
bingle. His throw to first was high
and drew Costello off the bag but
the ump called Yockey out to end
the rally.
In the Cal half of the fourth, Pat
Nagano tore in from right field and
drove past Cereghino to nab Ho
berg's Texas Leaguer off his shoe
tops in the most spectacular catch
of the game.
In the Stanford half, Hal Costello
was hit by a pitched ball and Na
gano bounced a sharp single past
third but Koll made Shortall pop
up and Randall fiied out to end the
inning.
CAL RALLIES
The Bear bats started to boom in
the fifth and Cal scored two runs to
go into the lead.
Stanford knotted the count in the
last of the fifth when Thompson
j tripled deep into the right field
corner and scored on Pfyl's hit. Pfyl
was caught off first and run down
by Captain Mel Dezabou of Cal in a
spectacular pile-up.
The Bears came back with three
runs in the sixth and one in the
seventh to put the game on ice.
Monte Pfyl turned in a good ball
game with three hits and a fine
catch that robbed Pugh of a hit in
the sixth.

The Bear bats started to boom in
the fifth and Cal scored two runs to
go into the lead.
Stanford knotted the count in the
last of the fifth when Thompson
j tripled deep into the right field
corner and scored on Pfyl's hit. Pfyl
was caught off first and run down
by Captain Mel Dezabou of Cal in a
spectacular pile-up.
The Bears came back with three
runs in the sixth and one in the
seventh to put the game on ice.
Monte Pfyl turned in a good ball
game with three hits and a fine
catch that robbed Pugh of a hit in
the sixth.
For two years California has had
Cootie Thompson's number and
the last game of the series Satur
day was no exception, for the
Bears solved the big hurler's slants
for a dozen hits and a 6-4 victory
over Stanford, to sweep the 1J)40
Big Series.
Mike Koll pitched his third win
over the Indians although he gave
up ten hits. Cal's southpaw ace was
less effective than he has been in
other games but was coming through
in the clinch.
Stanford got off to a good start
in the first inning. Alter Thompson
had struck out Hoberg with two
away and one on, the Indians scored
a run, Norm Juney's single to left
driving in Monte Pl'yl v/ho had
doubled.
BEARS THREATEN
The Bears threatened Stanford's
slim lead in the second inning when
Cootie walked two men in a row
with only one out. Thompson forced
Griffith to pop up for the second out
but Yockey drove a liner at third
that looked like a sure base hit. Elt
Boone made a spectacular dive to
spear the drive and cut off the
bingle. His throw to first was high
and drew Costello off the bag but
the ump called Yockey out to end
the rally.
In the Cal half of the fourth, Pat
Nagano tore in from right field and
drove past Cereghino to nab Ho
berg's Texas Leaguer off his shoe
tops in the most spectacular catch
of the game.
In the Stanford half, Hal Costello
was hit by a pitched ball and Na
gano bounced a sharp single past
third but Koll made Shortall pop
up and Randall fiied out to end the
inning.
