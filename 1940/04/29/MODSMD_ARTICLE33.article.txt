# Bimelech Favored By Derby Dopesters
## 
### 
EN ROUTE TO LOUISVILLE. Ky.,
April 23 (UP). —The 1940 Kentucky
Derby is strictly a four-horse race—
Bimelech. Mioland, Pictor and Dit.
That was the general sentiment
tonight among the horsemen who
headed south for the 66th running
of America's great turf extrava
ganza. All the King's horses and
all the King's men were on the way.
but few of them seriously believed
they could slop the runaway rush
of the No. 1 horse in the field—Col.
Edward Riley Bradley's newest and
mightiest "B"—Bimelech.
