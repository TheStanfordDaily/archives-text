Now that the Indian track team
has slaughtered California, the eyes
of the track world will be focused
on the coming Stanford - Southern
California meet in the Coliseum next
Saturday. The Cards after their
amazing show of strength in the Cal
meet should have no less than even
odds against Troy.
The Cal meet settled another big
question: whether Bill Ellington
was bringing his boys around too
last. Now I think that even the
most cynical observer must admit
that Ellington knows what he's do
ing and that the Card cinder men
turned in such sensational early
season performances only because
they were too good to be held
down. They will continue to im
prove.
The most interesting event down
South should be the mile with Stan
ford's sensational Paul Moore and
Mushy Girard tangling with Troy's
great Louie Zamperini and Leßoy
Weed. I think that only a Zamperini
at his very best could beat Moore
and probably not even then. After
running his fast mile against Cal, he
had enough left to run another mile.
If he is pushed by Zamperini, don't
be surprised to see him come very
close to the world's mark for the
mile.

The freshman tennis men de
feated California last week and
ended their season without a sin
gle defeat. Several names from
the frosh team should be remem
bered. Among these is husky
southpaw Tom Kruger, who shows
promise of becoming a regular on
next year's varsity. Then there is
lanky, boisterous Chuck Ilutche
son, who has one of the biggest
serves in the game and if he can
steady down will develop into one
of the greatest nctmen ever turned
out of Stanford.
