# YANKS LOSE AGAIN
## 
### 
Facing a possible season without
the services of the great Joe DiMag
gio, the New York Yankees fell
deeper into the American League
second division yesterday when
they were limited to six hits by their
| old jinx, Dutch Leonard, of the
Washington Senators. The Solons
won 3-2 as Steve Sundra and Fire
man Johnny Murphy combined on a
six-hit job. Two Yankee errors
were costly.
