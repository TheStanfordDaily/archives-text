LONDON, April 28 (UP).—A War
Office communique said today that
Allied forces had "repulsed" a Ger
man attack in the Gudbrands Valley
of central Norway and that addi
tional troop landings had been car
ried out "despite enemy air action."
The laying of a new mine field off
Narvik was announced by the Ad
miralty.
But the British public, increas
ingly alarmed over German suc
cesses in overrunning Norway,
wanted announcements of Allied
victories there and demands grew
louder for a bolder conception and
execution of the northern war
against Germany.
Military and political personages
high in the esteem of the British
public in speeches and in the press
urged the government to make a
maximum effort in Norway and
warned that the fate of the whole
war might turn on events in Scan
dinavia. The famous British blunder
of the last war, the ill-fated Galli
poli campaign, was recalled and held
up as a horrible example of what
may happen without a quick and
powerful Allied blow against the
Nazi invaders who are rapidly con
solidating their. hold on most of
Norway.
