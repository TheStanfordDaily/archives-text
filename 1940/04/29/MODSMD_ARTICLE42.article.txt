# The 						Legend of '43

### 
ONCE there were three high school gradu
ates, who wanted to go to college.
The first went to an Eastern school, great of
name and hoary with tradition. The day he
arrived he was wearing a four-in-hand tie, when
bow ties were in vogue! The second day he
forgot to wear his freshman cap. The third day
he forgot to call an upperclassman "sir."
The upperclassmen promptly disciplined him
for these atrocities, by means of paddles and a
duck-pond. At first the freshman didn't like it,
but he soon got into the spirit of things and the
next year he paddled freshmen too.
The second went to a state university. A few
weeks before registration he received a card
ordering him to appear a week early for "fresh
man week." He liked the idea of meeting all
the fellows early, but when he got there he
didn't like it so much. They had paddles and
duck-ponds too.
He wasn't sure whether or not to join a fra
ternity. Pledging took place the first week of
school, though, and since 95 per cent of the
student body was "row" and it would be simply
terrible if he didn't pledge, he joined a fraternity
he didn't like.
The third went to Stanford. He also received
a card about pre-registration activities, but this
one, instead of ordering him to come, asked him
to make up his own mind. When he got there
he was told that the school had some swell yells
and that he could learn them if he wanted to.
And at Stanford everybody wore the rooting
caps, and the pajamarino was as much fun for
the freshmen as for the upperclassmen. And
he was called a "Stanford man," not "that dumb
freshman." (Though, in fact, -he was awfully
dumb.)
And when he joined a fraternity, it was be
cause he liked the fellows in it, not because he
was afraid of being left out. Because he knew
by then that at Stanford a fraternity was a living
group, not a social clique which snubbed all
non-Greeks.
And when he went home his friends won
dered why he raved so much about Stanford.
One day they asked him why he, a mere fresh
man, could feel so deeply about a school he'd
only been at a year.
So he told them the story of the three high
school graduates.
