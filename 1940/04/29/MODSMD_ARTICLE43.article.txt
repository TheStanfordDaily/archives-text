# Fight and Fire
## 
### 
A WAVE of enthusiasm swept over the Farm
this week-end and the old-timers smiled
when they saw the overflow crowd at the ball
park and the thousands of looters at the Sta
dium outdoing any display of school spirit seen
at Stanford this year.
That crowd at the track meet surpassed the
attendance of many a post-Vow Boys football
game and the sudden rejuvenation of the old
fight and fire in the Cardinal rooting section
gave indications that Clark Shaughnessy's Big
Red Machine would get plenty of backing next
fall.
The impetus for this upswing in spirit was
provided by the victim of a raw deal, one Wil
liam Ellington, "assistant coach to nobody." Old
Bill in his one year as full-fledged coach has
turned out one of the strongest athletic teams
in Stanford history, restoring the confidence of
the student body in its major sports representa
tives.
Everett Dean started off the new era this
winter with the nation's fastest basketball team;
but it took Wild Bill to put the Indians on the
top of the heap in a major sport for the first
time in four years.
Most of the hoary traditions of Stanford have
been left by the wayside and most of them will
never be revived but one thing that the Farm
can and should hang onto is the old spirit in
backing the Cardinal teams. As our envoys
to the outer world they must receive every
ounce of support that the student body can
spare.
In Germany, spirit is compulsory; at Stanford
it is voluntary. The men and women of the
Farm should not usurp this freedom.—H. E.
