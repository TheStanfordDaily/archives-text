STANFORD is on trial.
This year, in accord with the great nation
wide census taken once in a decade, govern
ment employees comb the universities for
people who have no other residence save for
their school living place. And at Stanford this
year, apparently the only local people who are
co-operating with the census taker are the Uni
versity employees and the professors.
There is a tremendous social iesponsibility
connected with this matter. In certain European

countries a census of young men and women
is not necessary because conscription lists are
adequate but in this country the honesty and
co-operation of the people are relied upon to
accurately round up the statistics on our great
population.
If last year's figures can be used as a basis,
there are several hundred people, whose only
official residence is Stanford University, Cali
fornia, who have not co-operated with the cen
census taker this year.
When we consider the benefits that Stanford
has gotten directly from the government, such
as NY A and the air school, we must realize that
we owe it to that government to give our full
co-operation.
This matter only affects about one-fourth of
the campus but it is something that should be
thought over by everyone who calls himself
an American.—H. E.
