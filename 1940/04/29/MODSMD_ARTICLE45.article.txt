### JOHN LAWRY 
WE DEFEND TIIE STANFORD WOMEN
IT IS common knowledge that the only way to be
a success as a column writer is to start a cam
paign. It doesn't really matter what you campaign
for, just so long as you campaign long enough, and
loud enough. The regular bull sessioner has seen lit
to write biting diatribes against the Stanford women;
so I wish to utilize what little space I have to the de
fense of the women of this university. Yes, difficult as
it may sound, 1 propose to rush pell-mell into this
problem, to find just where in heaven's name I'll come
out.
Stanford women awake! (I cannot emphasize this
point 100 much: please awake.) Rally round and we'll
yet carry the battle into the enemy's camps. (Of
course if the camp proves to be Sequoia Hall, it's
quite possibly not worth all the effort.)
The Stanford women are distinctive. You can al
ways tell a Stanford woman in any crowd. Stanford
women stand out; not exactly like a sore thumb, but
more like a common, garden variety thumb: stolid,
and thick through.
The Stanford women show great dexterity and
grace of movement. They must be dextrous, or how
in do they get in those sweaters that button up
the back.
Stanford women appeal to a certain type of man.
(Reference: Cases in Abnormal Psychology; chaps.
3 and 4.)
Stanford women, as a rule, are intelligent. Stan
ford women, as a rule, do not go out with Stanford
men.

r pHE girls (there I've said it; I've called the Stanford
women "girls") at Stanford grow on you. This
of course is the ideal place for some enemy of the
campus women, who has a biological turn of mind, to
remark that there is only one type of animal that
grows upon another. However, we must all agree that
the Stanford women do grow on one. When one first
comes to Stanford fresh from the world of ordinary
women, the prospect of a four-year stay at the Uni
versity is quite dismal. There are a few odd students
who believe that beautiful women are distracting in
fluences in the classroom, but I agree with the Freud
ian principle as set down in my high school philoso
phy book, "Philosophy for Simple Folks, or Freud
for the Family," which says that good looking women
are the inspiration for all creative efforts. For this
reason the freshman at Stanford is good for practically
nothing. His reactions are slow, his eyes are blurred,
and his gastric juices hardly flow at all. Things begin
to look up in his sophomore year; after 12 months away
from the world of average women his eyes are no
longer blurred, just jaundiced. By the end of his
senior year the young man will swear that there are
no women like the Stanford women. Then to com
plete the cycle, the young man marries one of 'em;
and they set about raising another generation so that
their children can do the same thing.
In short, if you boys will carefully consider the
points I have just, set forward, you will find that the
Stanford women are almost as nice as the other women
you know.
