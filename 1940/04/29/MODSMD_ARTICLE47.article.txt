# AND SO THE DAILY
## 
### 
(Scene: (lie Shack. Surorundings: meager and
mostly broken. Atmosphere: bedlam. Partici
pants: potential or present Dippy bigwigs. Time:
any day.)
Livingston: God. I just heard the most awful thing
—a Cellar hasher died after eating Union food. Call
up Wilbur and get the details, only don't get mixed
up in politics. These damn freshmen who think
the Daily is just a political stepping stone. In my day
the Daily was a force respected on the campus—no
god-awful gravy train politicians coming around to
tell us what to put in the paper, and no Daily guys
were dumb enough to get mixed up in running for
damn student offices. I say again A CELLAR
HASHER DIED FROM EATING UNION FOOD!
(At long last the hoped-for bedlam ensues.)
Any H.C.E.: Look him up in the Bawlout and check
the spelling. An appreciative audience: Now Mellin
kofT can put it in his column. Goody, goody.
Jaques, (in profound abstraction): What's funny
about a moth? What makes women laugh at moths?
MellinkofT (in the MellinkofT manner): Why don't
you take on a load of cosmopolitan civilization? So
phisticate up. comrade. (At the top of his voice, the
following: Solidarity Forever.)
(The rest of the off-key singers join in I lie dis
harmony.)
Subnote: especially Willie Cannon.
Hutch and MellinkofT, simultaneously: Does any
one want some beer? We need a fourth at bridge.
M. J. Montgomery: Oh, for gosh sakes, leave the
kids alone. We're running a paper here. Where's
Burtt and Arch?
Innumerable freshmen: They're interviewing Hoo
ver.
Littlelx>y: At long Inst. Ah. (More dramatics of the
sordid type.)
Telephone voice: Is this the Daily? I just wanted
t<» say that war was declared last week and I wonder
il you can get a bul Iho red about it in. Please make
it soon. Thank you.
