# 'Strange Cargo' Depicts Age-old Moral Struggle
## 
### 
"STRANGE CARGO," playing at the Stanford Fox Theater.
"Strange Cargo" is one of the strongest movies Hollywood has pro
duced in some time. It is the story of seven convicts and a woman in
a penal colony in the Gucanas. Clark Gable plays the hero, while Joan
Crawford turns in a good performance as his woman.

In one of the most moving stories
of the year, Gable is the man who
is torn between Good and Evil. He
lives in the hope of escape from the
hated camp to Paris. Taking seven
others with him, he cleverly maneu
vers a break. Alter wandering
through* the jungle for many days
and losing tow men, they reach the
coast and their sail boat. En route
to the mainland three more die, leav
ing Gable, Crawford, Hunter, and
Lucas. Before each man dies,
Chatnbreau (Hunter) makes them
see the light of salvation.
GOI) AND THE DEVIL
From the first of the picture un
til it is two-thirds over, you will
wonder as the convicts do, ''Who is
Chambreau?" He foresees every
thing and predicts the victory of
Good over Evil.
Near the end it bcomes evident !
that Chambreau is God when Lu- 1
cas, personifying the Devil, walks
out, leaving Hunter a free field.
When Gable decides to go back to
serve his time and start with a clean
slate you know that he and his con
verted mistress will live happily ever
after.
If you are in the mood for lots
of moralizing, you will enjoy seeing j
lan Hunter turn in a beautiful per
formance as God, and Paul Lucas as
the Devil. Gable plays his usual
rugged, manly role. Joan Crawford
has finally exchanged her lady-like !
roles for good acting as a gutter
wench. Peter Loire is perfect as the
repulsive stool-pigeon.
ODD SHOTS EFFECTIVE
Effective shots are numerous
throughout the picture. The illu
sion of holiness is created by pho
tographing Hunter against a lighted
sky and with a single light illumi
nating his face when the rest are in
darkness. The movie is climaxed
with a striking picture of a lowly
fisherman crossing himself as he
watches Hunter walk down a path.
If you like good acting, excellent
photography, and an exceptional
plot, you will enjoy "Strange
Cargo."
Also running is "And One Was
Beautiful," starring Jean Muir and
Laraine Day. For a second feature,
it is pretty good. It. is an unusual
treatment of the usual eternal tri
angle.â€”Cull
