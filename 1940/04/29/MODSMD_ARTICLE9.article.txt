# Wilbur Tells Alumni Stanford May Need to Increase Tuition
## 
### BETTY HILLS 
The question of Stanford's past, present, and future was discussed last
Saturday by President Ray Lyman Wilbur in bis talk on "The State of
the University" before an assembly of alumni in the Little Theater of
Memorial Hall.
"In 18!*2 this University was over-advertised its everyone knew of

Stanford and of the immense
fortune he had donated to the cause
of education here," stated Dr. Wil
bur. Unfortunately, people still
think of Stanford as one of the rich
est univoristies in the world, but due
to depressions much of the former
large income has disappeared.
FINANCIAL PROBLEM
In other words, as Dr. Wilbur said,
"Stanford's reputation is bigger than
its pocketbook, and the problem of
trying to increase its income must
j be faced." The financial problem is
i critical. At the present time the fac
ulty is accepting a reduction of sal
ary which, according to Dr. Wilbur,
should be done away with so that
Stanford may continue to look for
ward to the high type of scholarship
it is noted for.
In the question period after his
talk. Dr. Wilbur remarked that the
problem may require an increase in
the tuition to provide a "stable and
sure source of income." The syllabus
and laboratory fees, which the stu
dents now have to pay, would be
included in this increase.
'UPPER BRACKETS'
If Stanford's enrollment is going
to grow in the future, it will have
to be "in the upper brackets, not in
the lower." At the present time the
lower-division is filled to capacity,
but GOO more students in the upper
division and in graduate work could
be added without an increase in
facilities.
Dr. Wilbur concluded by saying,
"You and I both want Stanford to
be a great university, so let us work
to gain our end."
Coach Clark Shaughnessy spoke
briefly, and the president of the
alumni, Henry L. Loud, presented
his annual report.
The six candidates unanimously
elected to the alumni executive
board to serve for the next two
years were: Floyd L. McElroy of
Palo Alto, Mrs. Zayda B. Martineau
of Los Angeles, Dr. Roy R. Reynolds
of San Francisco, Harold D. Weber
ol Oakland, James Petrini of Bak
ersfield, and Harold Maundrell of
Oakland.
It was decided to retain the an
nual spring date of University Day.
