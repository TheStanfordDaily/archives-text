hear the story of the wood
en horse that conquered Troy?
The Trojan capital withstood the
Grecian onslaught for ten years.
The Greeks were stopped, but they
found a way. They sneaked a
wooden horse into the city walls, at
tacked the city from within, and in
one night the city of Troy was no
more. '
Mr. Hitler also has a way. The
Reich, however, has no wooden
horse factories. But the German
commercial traveler serves the Nazi
purpose as Hitler's "wooden horse"
of the Twentieth Century.
Years ago Der Fuehrer purport
edly said: "Our strategy is to de
stroy the enemy from within, to
conquer him from himself."
He wasn't fooling. Variations
of this scheme have already proved
their worth. Austria and Czecho
slovakia were victims. And little
Denmark entered the casualty list
during the second week of April.
All of which should prove that
there is nothing a wooden horse can
do that a German commercial trav
eler can't do better.
This type of Nazi agent has not
had much publicity. Like ships that
pass in the night, they are sent into
neutral countries of Europe. There
they play a Jekyl and Hyde role.
To the unsuspecting populace they
are pleasant business men. Prob
ably of German descent. But if re
ports slanted from the Allies are to
be believed, they play a huge part
in Nazi intrigue and preparedness.

J ATEST indications from the Bal-
kans seem to show that these
agents have been arriving in the
Near East in copious numbers. Some
thing which is causing Allied intel
ligence officials much concern. Dur
ing the past war the Balkans were
the "powder barrel" of Europe. They
can be just as inflammable during
World War 11.
Be as it may, last week Yugo
slavia closed the door to further Nazi
infiltration. Fifty or more agents of
the Reich were deported, and a still
greater catch resulted in arrests in
high governmental posts.
These men explamed their pres
ence by claiming they were "pros
pecting for oil." Their excuse didn't
last long in the face of a furious
demonstration by citizens of Yugo
slavia.
Wooden horse ejections also be
gan in Rumania, where steps were
taken to eject unwanted Germans
from the country. Foreigners were
advised to turn in their passports
in a move calculated to expel al
most 50,000 German ctiizens from
Rumania.
Again in Turkey, the danger of
the wooden horse was felt. A bill
insuring "national safety from with
in" was prepared for the National
Assembly. Foreigners in Turkey
disguised as merchants, cabaret per
formers, and tourists received strong
governmental warnings to leave.

exhibited extreme
worry during the week's events.
An undercover expose worked by
the secret police declared that al
most 3000 Nazi agents were working
within the nation. British and
French residents left Budapest dur
ing the peak of rumors regarding an
imminent Nazi invasion.
The Egyptian cabinet also added
to the neutral galaxy of jittery na
tions. After hearing reports that the
nation was ridden with spies, a law
was passed making espionage and
treason against Egypt and her allies
a capital offense.
Another nation prepared to burn
her wooden horses when Switzer
land prepared for action. Govern
ment radio broadcasts warned the
populacc against foreign trickery,
assured them that swift warning
would be made should the coun
try be invaded.
Further reverberations of the Tro
jan horse scare were felt through
out Northern Europe. Sweden's press
began a carefully prepared expose
of Nazi activities, kept close sur
veillance on all foreign travelers
within her borders.

An undercover expose worked by
the secret police declared that al

The Egyptian cabinet also added
to the neutral galaxy of jittery na

nation was ridden with spies, a law
was passed making espionage and
treason against Egypt and her allies
a capital offense.

her wooden horses when Switzer

en horse that conquered Troy?
The Trojan capital withstood the
Grecian onslaught for ten years.
The Greeks were stopped, but they
found a way. They sneaked a
wooden horse into the city walls, at
tacked the city from within, and in
one night the city of Troy was no
more. '
Mr. Hitler also has a way. The
Reich, however, has no wooden
horse factories. But the German
commercial traveler serves the Nazi
purpose as Hitler's "wooden horse"
of the Twentieth Century.
Years ago Der Fuehrer purport
edly said: "Our strategy is to de
stroy the enemy from within, to
conquer him from himself."
He wasn't fooling. Variations
of this scheme have already proved
their worth. Austria and Czecho
slovakia were victims. And little
Denmark entered the casualty list
during the second week of April.
All of which should prove that
there is nothing a wooden horse can
do that a German commercial trav
eler can't do better.
This type of Nazi agent has not
had much publicity. Like ships that
pass in the night, they are sent into
neutral countries of Europe. There
they play a Jekyl and Hyde role.
To the unsuspecting populace they
are pleasant business men. Prob
ably of German descent. But if re
ports slanted from the Allies are to
be believed, they play a huge part
in Nazi intrigue and preparedness.
