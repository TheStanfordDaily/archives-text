preparing a book and collaborating on a series of essays based on original
research.

Russia.
As the victim of a crowded and
complicated schedule, he has so
many conferences that persons want

often mast make arrangements sev
eral days in advance.
HOPES FOR NEW OFFICE
Professor Spalding is very busy
but he h&S* vacant chinks in his
schedule from time to time. And
during these odd moments, for ex
ample, while he waits for a late
student in his little office that is nes
tled among the stacks in the upper
reaches of the Library, he can look
forward to something he has been
anticipating for some time now —his
new office in the Hoover Library on
War, Revolution, and Peace.
He looks forward to the time when
he will occupy a relatively roomy
office on the second floor of the new
structure'instead of a remote cubicle
so hard to find that frequently he
receives frantic phone calls from
students who have tried and failed,
winding up in frustration at some
place like the Rare Book Room or
the Felton Room.
STUDIES REVOLUTIONS
Since Professor Spalding's special
field is the first stages of the Russian
revolution, he makes extensive use
of the Hoover collection on that pe
riod—a collection which he terms a
more complete general survey than
those at Geneva, Paris, Prague, or
even the one at Moscow.
"Bad cataloguing and govern
mental restrictions make it difficult
for a student to use libraries in the
Soviet," he says. "Sometimes per
mission to use certain books or docu
ments simply isn't granted. Once I
was told someone was using the ma
terial I wanted, but it included a
large number of books and period
icals covering a long period of time
—more material than one person
possibly could lie using."
TALKS WITH TROTSKY
Professor Spalding tells of talking
with Leon Trotzky in Mexico a lit
tle over a year ago about the Hoover
Library.
"What is to be the name of the
new library?" Trotzky inquired.
"The Hoover Library on War, Rev
olution, and Peace," Mr. Spalding
answered.
"A fine name," Trotzky beamed.
"The war of capitalistic imperialism,
the social revolution raising out of
that war, and the lasting peace
which will follow."
"I doubt if Mr. Hoover would ap
prove of that interpretation," com
! ments Professor Spalding.
; LENIN'S CENSORSHIP
Censorship under Lenin is not. as
i rigid as that under Stalin, he ob
| serves; although methods can bo
questioned under the present re
; gime, policies themselves were legal
subject for public debate under
i Lenin's regime.
"Stalin can't debate as skillfully
as Lenin; instead, he uses brute
| force if necessary to silence his enc
j mies," says Mr. Spalding.
SCHOOL IN BELGIUM
After being graduated from Har
vard in 1020, Professor Spalding was
i studying in Belgium and France at
the time of the Russian famine. His
present interest in Russia stems from
his work there after obtaining an
j appointment under the Hoover re
lief commission. During subsequent
J years he spent several summers at
I Stanford, using the Hoover Library
! in his research studies.
Quiet, though friendly and cordial,
] he speaks in a low voice, impressing
■ his audiences by skillful handling of
facts rather than by dramatic pres
j entation.
Although his field is the revolu
j tion, he has at hand factual mate
rial that is completely up-to-date,
i His only apparent lag is entirely su
perficial; his students report that he
! continues to say "Petrograd." al
; though this city has been Leningrad
j since 1924.

student in his little office that is nes

reaches of the Library, he can look
forward to something he has been
anticipating for some time now —his
new office in the Hoover Library on
War, Revolution, and Peace.
He looks forward to the time when
he will occupy a relatively roomy
office on the second floor of the new
structure'instead of a remote cubicle
so hard to find that frequently he
receives frantic phone calls from
students who have tried and failed,
winding up in frustration at some
place like the Rare Book Room or
the Felton Room.
STUDIES REVOLUTIONS
Since Professor Spalding's special
field is the first stages of the Russian
revolution, he makes extensive use
of the Hoover collection on that pe
riod—a collection which he terms a
more complete general survey than
those at Geneva, Paris, Prague, or
even the one at Moscow.
"Bad cataloguing and govern
mental restrictions make it difficult
for a student to use libraries in the
Soviet," he says. "Sometimes per
mission to use certain books or docu
ments simply isn't granted. Once I
was told someone was using the ma
terial I wanted, but it included a
large number of books and period
icals covering a long period of time
—more material than one person
possibly could lie using."
TALKS WITH TROTSKY
Professor Spalding tells of talking
with Leon Trotzky in Mexico a lit
tle over a year ago about the Hoover
Library.
"What is to be the name of the
new library?" Trotzky inquired.
"The Hoover Library on War, Rev
olution, and Peace," Mr. Spalding
answered.
"A fine name," Trotzky beamed.
"The war of capitalistic imperialism,
the social revolution raising out of
that war, and the lasting peace
which will follow."
"I doubt if Mr. Hoover would ap
prove of that interpretation," com
! ments Professor Spalding.

STUDIES REVOLUTIONS
Since Professor Spalding's special
field is the first stages of the Russian
revolution, he makes extensive use
of the Hoover collection on that pe
riod—a collection which he terms a
more complete general survey than
those at Geneva, Paris, Prague, or
even the one at Moscow.
"Bad cataloguing and govern
mental restrictions make it difficult
for a student to use libraries in the
Soviet," he says. "Sometimes per
mission to use certain books or docu
ments simply isn't granted. Once I
was told someone was using the ma
terial I wanted, but it included a
large number of books and period
icals covering a long period of time
—more material than one person
possibly could lie using."
TALKS WITH TROTSKY
Professor Spalding tells of talking
with Leon Trotzky in Mexico a lit
tle over a year ago about the Hoover
Library.
"What is to be the name of the
new library?" Trotzky inquired.
"The Hoover Library on War, Rev
olution, and Peace," Mr. Spalding
answered.
"A fine name," Trotzky beamed.
"The war of capitalistic imperialism,
the social revolution raising out of
that war, and the lasting peace
which will follow."
"I doubt if Mr. Hoover would ap
prove of that interpretation," com
! ments Professor Spalding.
; LENIN'S CENSORSHIP
Censorship under Lenin is not. as
i rigid as that under Stalin, he ob
| serves; although methods can bo
questioned under the present re
; gime, policies themselves were legal
subject for public debate under
i Lenin's regime.
"Stalin can't debate as skillfully
as Lenin; instead, he uses brute
| force if necessary to silence his enc
j mies," says Mr. Spalding.
SCHOOL IN BELGIUM
After being graduated from Har
vard in 1020, Professor Spalding was
i studying in Belgium and France at
the time of the Russian famine. His
present interest in Russia stems from
his work there after obtaining an
j appointment under the Hoover re
lief commission. During subsequent
J years he spent several summers at
I Stanford, using the Hoover Library
! in his research studies.
Quiet, though friendly and cordial,
] he speaks in a low voice, impressing
■ his audiences by skillful handling of
facts rather than by dramatic pres
j entation.
Although his field is the revolu
j tion, he has at hand factual mate
rial that is completely up-to-date,
i His only apparent lag is entirely su
perficial; his students report that he
! continues to say "Petrograd." al
; though this city has been Leningrad
j since 1924.
