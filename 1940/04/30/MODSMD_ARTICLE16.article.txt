rangues by church officials and
family friends.
WEAK KING'S STORY
"Richard II" is the story of an
English prince, who was a good man
but a weak king. The tragedy of the
play lies in Richard's realizing too
late that he had bungled his job.
The bitterness of his realization is
shown in the prison scene.
The play opens with Richard
judging a quarrel between Mow
bray and Bolingbroke. He takes his
position as arbitrator lightly, changes
his mind and finally banishes the
two. Herein lies his first mistake,
for by banishment he did not insure
future peace.
VISITS (.AUNT
The second act shows Richard vis
iting John of Gaunt on his deathbed.
The old man loves Richard but de
plores his vacillating ways. Richard
confiscates Gaunt's property follow
ing his death.
The action picks up after this
when Richard returns from his fu
tile Irish campaigns to find his
cousin Bolingbroke mobilized against
him. The opposing forces are too
strong for the king and he is forced
to abdicate in favor of John of
Gaunt's son, Bolingbroke, later
known as Henry IV. Richard's mur
der in prison climaxes the play, and
Henry's coronation puts a grand
finale on the whftle production.

WEAK KING'S STORY
"Richard II" is the story of an
English prince, who was a good man
but a weak king. The tragedy of the
play lies in Richard's realizing too
late that he had bungled his job.
The bitterness of his realization is
shown in the prison scene.
The play opens with Richard
judging a quarrel between Mow
bray and Bolingbroke. He takes his
position as arbitrator lightly, changes
his mind and finally banishes the
two. Herein lies his first mistake,
for by banishment he did not insure
future peace.
VISITS (.AUNT
The second act shows Richard vis
iting John of Gaunt on his deathbed.
The old man loves Richard but de
plores his vacillating ways. Richard
confiscates Gaunt's property follow
ing his death.
The action picks up after this
when Richard returns from his fu
tile Irish campaigns to find his
cousin Bolingbroke mobilized against
him. The opposing forces are too
strong for the king and he is forced
to abdicate in favor of John of
Gaunt's son, Bolingbroke, later
known as Henry IV. Richard's mur
