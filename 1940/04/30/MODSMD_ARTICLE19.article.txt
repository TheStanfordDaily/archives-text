, 'Mellinkoff, president of the junior
class, and Moulton, president of In
terfraternity Council, traveled 900(1
miles, representing Stanford in de
bates with students at 18 univer
sities.
Moulton's talk will present the
views of the nation's students on
domestic political problems. Spe
cifically, he will discuss the Garner
vs. Roosevelt situation, as it is seen
by the students at the University of
Texas. From the viewpoint at the
universities of Alabama and Virginia
he will bring up Democratic party
problems in the "solid" South. By
way of comparison, he plans to in
troduce the characteristic attitudes
of Stanford students on national
politics.
FAVOR THIRD TERM
"We found that student opinion,
though varied as to sections of the
country-, is favorable to a third
term," Moulton commented. "The
South is still solid, but in the rest of
the country, much support is given
to favored native sons. On the
whole, however, President Roose
velt holds the edge."
Mellinkofl will devote his time to
discussing student, opinion on for
eign affairs, particularly with ref
erence to the war. He will consider
the questions of American partici
pation, the war's causes, and the his
torical implications, from the view
point of students he met on the trip.
ALLIES SUPPORTED
Mellinkofl remarked he found
students more interested in their
own local and national problems
than in international considerations.
The students who do think of world
problems, ho said, are definitely op
posed to American military partici
pation, but favorable to American
economic support of the Allies.
Students, he said, possess a scepti
cism as to the objectives of the Brit
ish Empire; but they do feel that
sale of munitions to the Allies on a
cash-and-carry basis is a policy
America should continue.
At the conclusion of the two talks,
the speakers will answer questions
put to them from the floor.
