# Farm Census Period Extended to May 2
## 
### 
There are about 300 students on
the campus who have not filled out
their census blanks, according to AI
Baldwin, campus enumerator. "In
the 1930 census," Baldwin said,
"about 300 more students filled out
the blanks than have this year. I
have received word from Washing
ton," he continued, "to extend the
period of enumeration until May 2."
Farm residents who have not
been enumerated by their parents
are urged by Baldwin to get their
blanks from the Cellar cigar counter,
to fill them out, and to return them
at once.

One out of every 16 registered
voters in Louisiana cannot write his
name, but signs his ballot by mark
ing a mark.
