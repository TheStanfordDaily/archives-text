The athletic carnival which has
made the Farm-a veritable thi'ee
ring sporting circus from week to
week for the past two-and-a-half
months has gone as suddenly as it
came.
It all started hack around the
middle of February when baseball
and swimming vied with basket
ball and rugby. Then as the lat
ter dropped off. tennis, golf,
swimming, boxing, and track took
their places.
But over the week-end, three
sports called it quits for the season,
tennis will be over next week after
the N.C.2A. qualifying round in Los
Angeles, and track is practically nil
as far as competition on the Farm
is concerned.
* *
THE BASEBALL CLUB, which in
iis last week annexed its only C.I.
B. A. series by thumping the Tro
jans. turned in their suits after their
third straight licking at the hands of
the pesky Bears, and thereby be
came deeply entrenched in the cel
lar.
The golfers, who had previously
won the Southern Division title,
lost to U.S.C. in the championships
at Los Angeles' lakeside course.
From now 'til June they'll just
have to keep in trim for the N. C.
2 A. championships back in Ver
mont by competing in local tour
neys.
The swimmers closed their season
with a victory over the Bears, there
by copping second place in the
Southern Division to the Trojans,
and adding that to their second in
the division swimming champion
ships last week.
* * *
WHAT TO DO now, we sports
writers. For a while we just about
had too much to cover on Satur
days when we were sending dope in

| to the city papers.
Sure it'll be swell covering the
! track team, except no one's going
to see them in action—unless it is
in a twilight meet —between now
and the end of the season.
] This Saturday it's the death strug
i gle with the Trojans for Bill El
| lington's gang. Then in order the
Cardinals go to the Fresno Relays,
the Finnish Relief Meet in Los An
geles, the F.C.C. meet in L.A., and
in June the N.C.2A., Compton Invi
tational, and A.A.U. meets in Min
; neapolis, Compton and Fresno.

WHAT TO DO now, we sports
writers. For a while we just about
had too much to cover on Satur
days when we were sending dope in

| to the city papers.
Sure it'll be swell covering the
! track team, except no one's going
to see them in action—unless it is
in a twilight meet —between now
and the end of the season.
] This Saturday it's the death strug
i gle with the Trojans for Bill El
| lington's gang. Then in order the
Cardinals go to the Fresno Relays,
the Finnish Relief Meet in Los An
geles, the F.C.C. meet in L.A., and
in June the N.C.2A., Compton Invi
tational, and A.A.U. meets in Min
; neapolis, Compton and Fresno.

THE SCHEDULE MAKERS might
be able to do something about this
situation so that we sports writers
won't feel so lost all of a sudden.
The athletic carnival which has
made the Farm-a veritable thi'ee
ring sporting circus from week to
week for the past two-and-a-half
months has gone as suddenly as it
came.
It all started hack around the
middle of February when baseball
and swimming vied with basket
ball and rugby. Then as the lat
ter dropped off. tennis, golf,
swimming, boxing, and track took
their places.
But over the week-end, three
sports called it quits for the season,
tennis will be over next week after
the N.C.2A. qualifying round in Los
Angeles, and track is practically nil
as far as competition on the Farm
is concerned.

THE BASEBALL CLUB, which in
iis last week annexed its only C.I.
B. A. series by thumping the Tro
jans. turned in their suits after their
third straight licking at the hands of
the pesky Bears, and thereby be
came deeply entrenched in the cel
lar.
The golfers, who had previously
won the Southern Division title,
lost to U.S.C. in the championships
at Los Angeles' lakeside course.
From now 'til June they'll just
have to keep in trim for the N. C.
2 A. championships back in Ver
mont by competing in local tour
neys.
The swimmers closed their season
with a victory over the Bears, there
by copping second place in the
Southern Division to the Trojans,
and adding that to their second in
the division swimming champion
ships last week.
