# Ellington Puts Trackmen Through Odd Distances. In Prep for U. S. C. Meet
## 
### 
Flush from their decisive victory over California. Stanford's cinder
men worked out at those odd distances which their coach. Kill Ellington,
favors so much for his training routine.
i'tlingtons favorites are the .'{s2-yard dash, the MiO-yard run. and the
six-lap run. though none ol tliese events are on the nine regular meets

►schedule, they each have a definite
1 purpose in whipping a trackman into
j top shape.
For instance, Bill sent his hurdlers
and sprint men though a 352 or two
last evening in order to strengthen
them. This longer distance than they
j are used to helps their wind and
makes their regular, shorter races
I seem like a breeze—almost.
CLARK DOWNS 660 TIME
For the quarter-milers Bill recom
mends the 660-yard run. Last night
Ernie Clark raced through the fastest
660 that has been lun by any Stan
: ford track man this year. His time
I was 1:19.9; to show how good this
really is, consider that Ben Eastman's
i best-ever time at this event was only
[1.8 seconds faster.
Last night the Card two-milers,
| A1 Soldate and Jack Moore, toured
through a six-lapper in 7:02. This
event, being shorter than their usual
I distance of two miles, is plainly not
,to develop endurance, but to en
courage speed in a finishing kick.
lIAYES, GIRARD UNCERTAIN
The Indians' cripples, Sid Hayes
I and Mush Girard, seem to be main
-1 taining their mystery men roles for
| another successive week-end. Last
; Saturday. Sid ran his first flight of
' hurdles in four weeks and despite his
| long rest came home in front. But
| going over that last hurdle, he ag
! gravated his injury and consequently
| he wasn't in a suit last night and
j doesn't know whether or not he
! will be able to run against the
j mighty Trojans this Saturday.
Mushy Girard had hoped to run
I for Stanford against the Bears in the
two-mile, but when the meet ap
peared in the bag, Ellington
| scratched him to save for U.S.C. Last
night Mush showed no sign of his
[ past injury as he wheeled through a
| two-minute half-mile.
Little Bob Kenyon continued to
shove upward his ceiling in the pole
vault. Now consistent at 13 feet 6
inches. Bob just barely missed 13
; feet 10 inches in yesterday's prac-
