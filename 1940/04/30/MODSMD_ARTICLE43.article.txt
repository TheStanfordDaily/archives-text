# Indian Gridders Practice Today
## 
### 
The Farm will get its weekly look i
at the 1940 Big Red Machine under j
construction in spring practice this,
afternoon. The workout will run !
from 3:45 to 5:45 o'clock on the j
practice field.
Over 100 spectators turned out to [
watch the gridders go through their j
paces last week, anticipating a !
scrimmage that never came off.
Coach Clark Shaughnessy has not I
announced yet when his teams will |
tee off against each other for the
first time. There was no scrum last
week because the players did not
know their assignments well
enough.
Spectators are asked to stay
either in the stands or on the side
lines during practice, well out of the
way of the squad.
