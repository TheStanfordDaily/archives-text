# Wolter Plans Spring Series With Moffat
## 
### 
Stanford may have ended its
baseball season with the 6-4 loss
to California last Saturday after
neon, but the club still isn't
through with baseball.
According to Coach Harry Wolter,
the team will work out for most of
the rest of the quarter, probably
practicing about three days a week.
He has also been trying to schedule
a series ol games for the club with
the Moffat Field baseball team. II
things go as Wolter plans the In
dians will meet the Moffat Field
outfit about once a week.
JUNIORS COMPOSE TEAM
Most ol this year's team was made
up of juniors, and the work that
they will get from now until the
end oi the quarter will probably do
the boys a world of good next sea
son.
A new season means new hope,
and Stanford, with a team of expe
rienced veterans, will be gunning
ior top spot next year. Of the team
that opened against the Bears Sat
urday there were only four boys
who will not return â€” Sid Lewis,
catcher, Dick Shortall at second
base, Captain Norm Juney in left
fieid. and Pat Nagrfno in right field.
SENIORS FLAY SERIES
Even at that, two of those seniors,
Shortall and Nagano, had not been
playing regularly before the start of
the Cal series. Harry Parsons, a
sophomore, played most of the sea
son at the keystone sack and will be
back for more next year; while the
tight field spot will probably be wide
open.
Not a man on the pitching staff
graduates so the hurling corps of
"Cootie" Thompson, Claude Purkitt,
Biil Masters, and Fiuss Smith will
remain intact and will be aided and
abetted by Phil Wolf, flashy frosh
hurler who set the Cal frosh down
with two hits Saturday.
