THE Board of Athletic Control showed last
night that it is willing to recognize the abil
ity of Stanford athletes.
No interested observer can attack the oft
harassed athletic moguls today after their nearly
unanimous willingness to give three Indian
spring sports squads a chance at national cham
pionships despite the fact that it will probably
take s6me nifty deficit budgeting to turn the
trick.
The B.A.C. depends almost entirely on foot
ball revenue. Football, as you well know from
your drowsy fall Saturday afternoons, has not
covered the bill. Since the Rose Bowl days, the
Board management has been buying red ink in
gross lots. Naturally every grant of money for
trips, jackets, equipment, or incidentals sent
the crimson bill upward.
But the Board is still composed of a lot of
human beings who are just as convinced as
we are that some expenses have to be incurred
regardless of the contemporary budgetary
trends.
In the three cases at hand, the Board might be
doing a good deal more for themselves finan
cially than they realize. In the first place they
are making a lot of Stanford athletes realize
that maybe the long fight for a successful sea
son and a chance at the best competition is
worth the trouble. In the second place, at least
two of the squads are better than even choices
to bring back national championships.
The power and prestige rendered an insti
tution by a team of championship caliber can
only be measured by remembering the reams
of advantageous publicity given Stanford in
the days of the Vow Boys and later during the
Laughing Boys' regime.
Maybe it is fortunate for the Board of Athletic
Control that we are lucky enough to have three
teams of enough merit to warrant their being
sent out after bigger game. A couple of na
tional titles would be a fair exchange for four
years of dismal gridiron luck.
