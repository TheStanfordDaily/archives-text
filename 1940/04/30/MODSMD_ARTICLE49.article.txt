STANFORD'S long - suffering but persistent
Tuesday Evening Lecture Series, child of
the Committee on Public Exercises, will be
jolted a little out of its usual 7:30 calm tonight.
Palo Alto dowagers may have to arrive even
earlier than they customarily do. And the hand
ful of students who regularly wander over Me
morial Hall way of a Tuesday night may find
it a little difficult to find choice seats. The Tues
day Evening Series' usual attendance may pos
sibly be augmented by several hundred curious
Farm men and women who would like to hear
exactly how it is with America—from a student
standpoint.
Back last week from a whirlwind tour of the
United States, Stanford's top-flight debaters,
Sherm Mellinkoff and Bob Moulton, will dish
up for Farm consumption tonight the tangible
results of a 9,000-mile jaunt. Besides winning
all except two of their debates and adding more
to Stanford prestige than a certain 25 traveling
athletes, Moulton and Mellinkoff were close to
the strange, variable pattern known as "under
graduate opinion."
In the solid South—in Alabama and Virginia
—they talked with students about next autumn's
elections, about Roosevelt s third term chances.
At Columbia, Harvard, Princeton they discussed
America's stand in regard to Europe's current
World War. On their way westward across the
great central plains of America they stopped
at the University of Chicago, in lowa, in Colo
rado. And on each platform they argued ques
tions of national concern. Later, in fraternity
house bull sessions and back-stage re-hashes,
they asked, "What do you think about it ? What
do you think America will do?"
The answers they heard to these questions
will constitute the body of tonight's discussion.
And the summary that will be presented may
express one thing — the attitude of college
America. D. H.
