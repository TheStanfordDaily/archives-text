EDITOR, SIR:
Dear Dean Bunn: I cried when my boy went
away to Stanford. It was so far away and I wondered
if he would be among friends. He joined a fraternity
and now when he writes home for money he tells me
what great lun it is being a Greek. He wears a pin,
and he says hello to sorority girls, and they have such
fun singing songs at the dinner table.
I have never been the selfish type of mother. My
boy has been given everything. I've given him the
last drop of my strength at times and if he can grow
up to be the man his father was (God bless him) I
shall never take a bit of credit for his success. That
is a true mother's love, you know.
That is why I am writing you. The thought of giv
ing my boy a mother while he's so far away from
home is too beautiful for words. Of course I know
you would never let this woman try and win my boy
away from me. I could never bear it if she did.
There is one favor I should like to ask. Would you
please ask this hew mother of his to go with him when
he gets his hair cut. If he goes by himself he comes
back with that awful shaved look, and most of his
pretty hair cut off. He does have such pretty hair.
And when he comes back to his fraternity after he
has graduated, ah, that will be the greatest moment
of all.
I can see them know. My dear boy greeting his
dear old grey-haired house mother. He may not re
member any of the fellows, but he'll remember that
dear old house-mother of his. Isn't it a beautiful
thought? I think it is something A1 Jolson might do
well. Maybe I'll suggest it to him, but you can be
sure I'll give you all the credit. I may have my faults,
but I'm certainly not selfish.
