### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
IN TIIE NAME OF TIIE DEAD
OW that the brilliance of the Freshman Edition has
crept from the Daily Shack on little cat feet, some
of us are beginning to think that those freshmen are
really fine writers. We are beginning to think that
their talents are far above their positions. Surely
yesterday's Bull Sessioner displayed an art that must
make the powers-that-be feel guilty for making him
read copy.
In short, the freshmen are being exploited by the
seniority system. And that makes one feel badly
enough. But worse than exploiting freshmen is ex
ploiting the name of a dead man. And that is what
a great number of organizations and promoters have
been doing to Will Rogers.
Hence, since I can find no adequate apology for
the upperclassmen's exploitation of the hearts and
heads of our freshmen, particularly of Bull Sessioner
John Lawry, the only alternative is to attack an ex
ploitation that pales our own. People are once again
paying a portion of their 40 cents to hear an American
Legion Commander exploit the name of a famous
American humorist in the interests of some Legion
charity program. Even an exploiting old reprobate
of an upperclassman cannot fail to be a little disgusted.
You sit through one of Hollywood's B-pictures try
ing desperately to fall asleep. And just as though
"Sure-Shot Grandma and her escapades with a six
shooter aren't sufficient to aggravate your visual indi
gestion, the managers of the theater take great pleasure
in presenting an American Legion Commander who
tears your heart in two as a prelude to the ushers'
tearing your pocket book in two. It is all very wear
ing on the emotional and financial anatomy.

you do not necessarily harbor any deep- seated
resentment against charity. And you do not feel
fundamentally antagonistic toward Will Rogers. But
you simply feel that Will Rogers' name is being some
what overworked in the interests of monuments, me
morials, and momentos.
The Legion Commander says, "We loved Will Rog
ers; Will Rogers was our friend." And you feel sure
that Will Rogers was literally a friend of all mankind
if all the claims upon his bosom companionship are
legitimate. You feel a little inclined to doubt the
veracity of the Legion Commanders' sweeping claims.
And most of all you feel that the American Legion
ought to raise money for its charity on the charity's
merits and not. on an overworked sympathy for the
late Will Rogers. You feel that Will Rogers did quite a
bit of work when he was living, but that he is far more
overworked now than lie is dead.
Is it possible that the American Legion is using
Will Rogers to continue its campaign to justify its
existence? There is a topic for one of the exploited
freshmenâ€”the one who wrote "Lightly and Politely."
