The question has been raised: What is this strange
association between moths and women? What illicit
thing is this? Is it really?
Madame, it is. And if you do not know the fate of
the moth and the woman and the candle that would
not burn, listen to my tale.
Now if a moth should ever come in contact with a
woman's hand or face or foot or any part of her skin,
her fate is sealed, her life an open book. At the mo
ment. of the touching she is betrothed to the Black
One.
That night he becomes her husband.
A child will ensue, a small black male child with
a cloven hoof and red hair.
This child, with his cloven foot, will be the most
unhappy of mankind. More because he will be like
a mule, in one sense, than for any other reason.
His life will be one of dire misery. He will spend
it for the greater part in dark closets and under rich
rugs looking for moths that he may wreak his ter
rible revenge.
Laugh if you will.
