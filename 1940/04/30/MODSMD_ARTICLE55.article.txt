# Wilde's Story Told in New, Clear Version
## 
### 
"OSCAR WILDE AND THE
YELLOW 'NINETIES,'" by Fran
ces Winwar, on sale at the Stan
ford Bookstore.
In the last decade of the nine
teenth century, Oscar Wilde stood
head and shoulders above his con
temporaries as the leader, the chief
exponent, and the symbol of the
aesthetic movement. Probably no
one else has ever lived as much for
beauty, and beauty alone, as did
Oscar Wilde.
It is the irony of fate that he should
be remembered in the public mind
for a malady that, at the peak of his
career, brought him from the Olym
pian heights to universal contempt
and a prison cell.
OBJECTIVE WORK
Miss Winwar's biography of Wilde
is the most cool-headed, objective
book about him that has come out in
years. Where many authors would
be drippingly sentimental or heat
edly partial, her restraint produces
a clearer and certainly a more un
derstandable portrait, not only of
Wilde but of the whole fin de siecle
school.
Part of a tetrology included
"Farewell the Banner" (Coleridge
and the Wordsworths), "The Ro
mantic Rebels" (Byron, Shelley, and
Keats), and "Poor Splendid Wings"
(the Rosettis and their circle), "Os
car Wilde and the Yellow 'Nineties"
brings to a dramatic close an ac
count of great nineteenth century
poets and authors.
BIOGRAPHY INCOMPLETE
Had Miss Winwar been more con
scious that Wilde was a great author,
and probably the greatest conversa
tionalist and wit in England's his
tory, her biography would be more
complete. After all, the man did
write in eight different forms and
two languages.
The only one of Wilde's innumer
able witticisms that stands out in
my mind from her book is his reply

to the customs official's inquiries up
on his first arrival in New York: "I
have nothing to declare — but my
genius." Yet this is a sound eval
uation of a complicated and highly
controversial subject.—Adams
