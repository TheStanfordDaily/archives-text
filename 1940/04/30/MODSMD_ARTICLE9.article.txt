# B.A.C. Gives Three Trips To Athletes
## Track, Golf, Tennis Squads Get Chance At National Meets 
### 
Despite losses suffered in football
revenue for the past three years, the
Board of Athletic Control last night
awarded trips to national competi
tions for three of Stanford's out
standing spring sports squads.
Foremost among the grants was
an unstipulated amount to cover all
"possible point winners" in the
N.C.A.A. meet in the middle of
June. Also on this trip will be the
annual Big Ten Pacific Coast Con
ference competition at Evanston, 111.,
on June 17.
The Farm's two-time national in
tercollegiate golf champions were
allowed $1100 to be used for their
third consecutive attempt at the title
at Manchester, Vt., during the lat
ter part of June. Since it is highly
probable that the grant will not
cover a full squad of players, man
agers, and coaches, the board left
its ultimate expenditure up to the
golf squad itself.
A like condition was voiced in the
granting of $400 to the tennis team,
in the event that Stanford qualifies
men this week-end for the coming
intercollegiates. Three of the Indian
squad will vie for positions in the
Pacific Coast section qualifying
rounds at Los Angeles this week
end.
Should only one man win his
berth, his expenses would probably
be fully paid. In the event of a two
or three-man delegation, the addi
tional expenses will be paid either
by the competitor himself or by
outside contributions.
