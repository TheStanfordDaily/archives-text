### WILSON CANNON 
r JpHAT German onslaught has fi
nally succeeded in its first im
portant objective.
A thin grey-clad line of Nazi
troops yesterday completed a belt
about Norway's waist. A belt of steel
and iron that may cut the Scandi
navian nation literally in two.
Since the first lightning attack
upon Norway, the military tech
nicians of the Reich have been
aiming toward this objective. They
claimed that once the line is com
plete, Southern Norway will be
theirs . . . and the English can
have the rest.
For Southern Norway can fill
Germany's needs. Needs both stra
tegic, and material.
From air bases on the southwest
ern edge of Scandinavia, Germany
can launch her bombing planes.
Precious loads of gasoline can be
sacrificed for more explosives, due
to the material lessening of air dis
tance.
From rich ore fields in this area
the Reich may fill her pressing
needs for steel' to build her fighting
machines. Deposits of oil will feed
these machines once they are con
structed. A lifeline of material will
open for Germany.

naval and submarine bases
near the Skaggerak, the now
limping sea-strength of Germany
will rise with new power in the
Baltic. These strategically-placed
bases will insure Germany from
surprise attack from the North Sea,
will play an important role in keep
ing the British fleet at bay.
But, first of all, the Reich must
hold her newly gained position.
Official report of the German
gains made the following state
ments:
1. Nazi forces have finally
bridged the last gap between col
umns moving inland from Oslo
and Trondheim.
2. Dombas has been captured by
the Germans after heavy fighting.
(Dombas is a vitally located rail
way junction, 100 miles south of
German-held Trondheim.)
Official praise for this slim line of
German troops was- presented by
Der Fuehrer in an order of the day.
Hitler was wordy in bouquets tossed
to his fighting forces, which won
what he termed "an inestimable
victory."
He said the Allies were unable to
cope with the superior German
strength despite arrival of rein
forcements.

QFFICIAL opinion in England was
umbrellaed with silence. Prime
Minister Neville Chamberlain told
the House of Commons that any
present statement from him would
be contrary to the best interests of
the Empire and the British cam
paign in Norway.
England seems to be having her
share of troubles.
And England's bad news was con
tinued in a short double feature.
This time the scene was on the
diplomatic front.
Unofficial sources in London, re
portedly close to Number 10 Down
ing Street, told an unhappy story of
a Russian overture. The Nazi press
told the same tale with great gusto.
These sources indicated that
British attempts to close an iron
clad trade agreement with Russia
had met with utter failure.
The obstacle to settlement, they
said, was Soviet insistence that ex
ports of Russian goods to Ger
many arc her own business. But.
they added, the Soviet position is
still under consideration.
Cooler heads in Britain took this
stand as an indication that Russia,
like Italy, was not ready to jump in
World War 11. At least not until the
top man finally emerges. But the
more jittery members of Chamber
lain's circle left the Russian state
ment. with an aggravated attack of
the nerves.
More potential trouble, this time
for the Reich, in the Balkan area
where Hungary issued a warning to
German-protected Slovakia. Hun
gary claimed she would send her
troops into that country if rights of
her minorities were not recognized.
