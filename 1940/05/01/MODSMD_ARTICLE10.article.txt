# Excom Again Raises Hope For Sundeck
## Base New Possibility On Skilled Student, Influential Alumnus 
### DICK DUDMAN 
These Stanford sun bathers may
get their new sun deck after all, it
became apparent last night.
After a week's pessimistic con
sideration of the problem, Sylvia
Berry and her subcommittee turned
up with this sanguinary possibility:
A sun deck, constructed by a stu
dent who is an experienced carpen
ter out of lumber which may be do
nated by "a certain influential alum
nus."
ESTIMATE HIGH
This action followed five weeks of
contradictory decisions by the com
mittee—a different, one each week,
but each because of "important new
facts."
Last week's new facts were a
high Corporation Yard estimate for
the job ($256.26) and Student Man
ager John Cobbs' report that the
University probably would permit no
one else to do the work.
THREE-DAY JOB
This week's new facts were the
"influential alumnus" and the stu
dent carpenter — John Alltucker —
who reportedly is a member of the
union and can do the job in three
days if volunteers haul the lumber
up the stairs to him.
Cobbs said he had obtained Uni
vci-sity pcrmisison for the job to be
undertaken by someone besides the
Corporation Yard, provided the lat
ter could inspect the structure and
"make sure it measures up to Cor
poration Yard standards."
Committeemen were doubtful
whether the new deck could be com
pleted this year.
Other business follows:
GIFT FLAG: Although the
Y.W.C.A. made no contribution this
year to Chinese student relief, Nor
man Stoner, law grad fall and win
ter quarters, sent them a check
for $3.
Last night, Ex Committee exam
ined evidence of the Chinese stu
dents' gratitude—a brilliant Chinese
flag, a letter of thanks from Mabel
Houk King, executive secretary of
the Far Eastern Student Service
Fund, and another from Henry P.
Van Dusen, chairman of the fund.
"I think they must be counting
last year's $100 too," said Vice-
President Coline Upshaw, who pre
sided in absence of President Ken
Cuthbertson.
Committeemen decided the flag
should be turned over to Stoner for
formal presentation by him to the
Y.W.C.A.
AWARDS SHAKE-UP: Bill Rapp
reported athletic coaches are busy
drawing up new awards programs

proval, Rapp reported.

gomery and John Porter were ap

On the committee, according to the
new by-law, will be the student
manager and four others to be ap

Ex Committee, one person at large,
and two members of the faculty.
The by-law gives the committee

may seem to it desirable.

These Stanford sun bathers may
get their new sun deck after all, it
became apparent last night.
After a week's pessimistic con
sideration of the problem, Sylvia
Berry and her subcommittee turned
up with this sanguinary possibility:
A sun deck, constructed by a stu
dent who is an experienced carpen
ter out of lumber which may be do
nated by "a certain influential alum
nus."
ESTIMATE HIGH
This action followed five weeks of
contradictory decisions by the com
mittee—a different, one each week,
but each because of "important new
facts."
Last week's new facts were a
high Corporation Yard estimate for
the job ($256.26) and Student Man
ager John Cobbs' report that the
University probably would permit no
one else to do the work.
THREE-DAY JOB
This week's new facts were the
"influential alumnus" and the stu
dent carpenter — John Alltucker —
who reportedly is a member of the
union and can do the job in three
days if volunteers haul the lumber
up the stairs to him.
Cobbs said he had obtained Uni
vci-sity pcrmisison for the job to be
undertaken by someone besides the
Corporation Yard, provided the lat
ter could inspect the structure and
"make sure it measures up to Cor
poration Yard standards."
Committeemen were doubtful

pleted this year.
