Stanford opposes house mothers for the fraternities.
In a survey of campus opinion just completed by The Stan-
I ford Daily, 72 per cent of all students questioned "disapprove
of house mothers for Stanford fraternities," 19 per cent "favor"
the plan, and 9 per cent "don't know."
As might be predicted, the Row, both men and women, was
! nearly unanimous in its protest against the suggested change;
93 per cent disapproved, and 7 per cent were undecided. The
j Halls, however, voted only 27 per cent in favor of house mothers,
j although 23 per cent were undecided. Graduate students as a
, group had the highest percentage in favor of house mothers, with
j 30 per cent.
Tabulations according to classification are as follows:

Independents 21% 79% 0%
Graduates 30% 70% 0%
Halls 27% 50% 23%
(Any percentage less than .5 is considered 0.)
The students voting against house mothers were asked what
they suggest in place of Dean Bunn's proposal, and 67 per cent
indicated their satisfaction with the present system by voting for
the "status quo." A need for some reform was suggested by a
little more than one-fourth of the students questioned, 16 per cent
' of whom voted for "permanent alumni sponsors," 10 per cent
< for "men proctors," and 7 per cent "didn't know."
The students questioned considered the problem carefully,
some even presented arguments to justify their views. A few
I of the comments follow:
"Let's have house mothers, if the system is run like it is in
the East." "Just as it is is fine for me." "The present system is
adequate." "Some change is desirable, but house mothers are
not the answer."
A few of the students were bitterly sarcastic, suggesting
everything from "boy proctors" to "geisha girls."

of house mothers for Stanford fraternities," 19 per cent "favor"
the plan, and 9 per cent "don't know."
As might be predicted, the Row, both men and women, was
! nearly unanimous in its protest against the suggested change;
93 per cent disapproved, and 7 per cent were undecided. The
j Halls, however, voted only 27 per cent in favor of house mothers,
j although 23 per cent were undecided. Graduate students as a
, group had the highest percentage in favor of house mothers, with
j 30 per cent.
Tabulations according to classification are as follows:
Favor Disapprove Undec.
Row 0% 93% 7%
Independents 21% 79% 0%
Graduates 30% 70% 0%
Halls 27% 50% 23%
(Any percentage less than .5 is considered 0.)
The students voting against house mothers were asked what
they suggest in place of Dean Bunn's proposal, and 67 per cent
indicated their satisfaction with the present system by voting for
the "status quo." A need for some reform was suggested by a
little more than one-fourth of the students questioned, 16 per cent
' of whom voted for "permanent alumni sponsors," 10 per cent
< for "men proctors," and 7 per cent "didn't know."
The students questioned considered the problem carefully,
some even presented arguments to justify their views. A few
I of the comments follow:
"Let's have house mothers, if the system is run like it is in
the East." "Just as it is is fine for me." "The present system is
adequate." "Some change is desirable, but house mothers are
not the answer."
A few of the students were bitterly sarcastic, suggesting
everything from "boy proctors" to "geisha girls."
