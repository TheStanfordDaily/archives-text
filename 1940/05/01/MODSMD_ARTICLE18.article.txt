LAVISH PRODUCTION
As the most elaborate production
to be given at Stanford during Hu
bert Heffner's present regime, "Rich
ard II" promises to be one of the
most lavish that Stanford has ever
produced in its own theater. Coupled
with a more - than,- able directing
staff and stage crew, will be one of
the largest and most adequately cast,
groups of players ever seen here.
Add to these the colossal gothic
sets by Waldemar Johansen and the
sumptuous period costumes of Mrs.
Helen Green, and Stanford will havo
a well assembled production of
Shakespeare's famous tragedy.
In keeping with the somber splen
dor of Johansen's gothic sets are the
period costumes designed for the
show by Helen Green. The costumes
add the final elaborate touch to the
entire presentation of court splen
dor.
COLOR SETS MOOD
Coloring for the costumes follows
the emotional theme of the play.
This is seen in the hues of Rich
ard's costumes, starting with moder
ately bright colors at the beginning
of the play, building to a climax of
brilliance when Richard returns
from the Irish campaigns, and grad
ually decreasing in intensity with
the downfall of this unfortunate
ruler.
Achievement of the effect was ac
complished by the "rummage sale to
king's court" method, according to
Mrs. Green. Costumes run from rich
velvets and laces to flannel and
cheesecloth. Cardboard armor and
dish-rag chain-mail offset the fur
and silk splendor of the bishop's
dress.
Adding to the costume color, the
backgrounds of brown, violet and
green wilJ be accentuated with royal
banners and flags done in heraldic
patterns. .
Stanford's kings and queens will
parade in rags and riches for three
nights, May 2, 3, and 4. Tickets are
50 cents apiece, and may be reserved

Coloring for the costumes follows
the emotional theme of the play.
This is seen in the hues of Rich
ard's costumes, starting with moder
ately bright colors at the beginning
of the play, building to a climax of
brilliance when Richard returns
from the Irish campaigns, and grad
ually decreasing in intensity with
the downfall of this unfortunate
ruler.
Achievement of the effect was ac
complished by the "rummage sale to
king's court" method, according to
Mrs. Green. Costumes run from rich
velvets and laces to flannel and
cheesecloth. Cardboard armor and
dish-rag chain-mail offset the fur
and silk splendor of the bishop's
dress.
Adding to the costume color, the
backgrounds of brown, violet and
green wilJ be accentuated with royal
banners and flags done in heraldic
patterns. .
Stanford's kings and queens will
parade in rags and riches for three
nights, May 2, 3, and 4. Tickets are
