# Kerr to Discuss Labor Over KGO
## 
### 
Clark Kerr, acting assistant pro
fessor of economics, will discuss the
losses and gains of labor in a talk
on "European Labor and the War,"
to bo broadcast tonight at o'clock
over station KPO.
Working standards have been
sacrificed in order to increase pro
duction, Professor Kerr maintains,
but workers are nevertheless in a
position to win new concessions from
their governments.
As examples of measures passed
by the belligerents in answer to la
bor's demands, he cites regulations
preventing profiteering, fixing prices,
and taxing war profits.
