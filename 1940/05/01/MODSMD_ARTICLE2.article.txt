# Mellinkoff, Moulton Tell Of America
## Traveling Debaters Give Student's View Of Government, War 
### RUTH RICHMOND 
"They are wondering more than
anything else what the outcome will
be and of course wonder implies
hope," Sherman Mellinkoff summed
up undergraduate views of the war
in Europe last night when he and
Bob Moulton addressed the Tuesday
Evening Series on "Students Look
at America."
He said that opinion was divided
into two groups. Some feel that the
dictators arose because of national
maladjustment either economic or
political; but if conditions caused
the dictators, the dictators caused
the war.
LOOK AT ECONOMICS
The minority looks upon this at
titude as naive and superficial and
tries to discover an economic ele
ment.
In an overwhelming majority,
however, they want to see the Allies
win. Only a few are fatalistic, doubt
the Allies' motives, and "they are
not very interested in which side
wins," Mellinkoff stated.
Within the national parties Bob
Moulton recounted finding the Dem
ocrats a solid group, while the Re
publicans were divided in the inter
ests of favorite sons.
GUESS CANDIDATE
"Even in the face of disapproval of
the New Deal policy, they will still
vote the Democratic ticket when put
to the test," he remarked of the
Solid South.
From St. John's debaters, Moulton
received the opinion that New York
ers resent Dewey's effort to cash in
throughout the country on his local
reputation. Also they feel that a
great deal of the credit was due
Mayor LaGuardia.
"They are still pro-Roosevelt,"
was his opinion of Garner's home
stale, Texas.
Guessing at the line-ups, Moulton
said, "On the Republican ticket we
will find either Vandenberg or
Dewey; and on the Democratic tick
et either Roosevelt or Hull."
DISLIKES DRAWL
"In order to listen to a southern
drawl, you have to be a man of
leisure," complained Sherman Mel
linkoff, who already had to apolo
gize for his first name and explain
that at least he was from Southern
California.
Mellinkoff quoted one of his debate
opponents as saying, "Where goes
the American dollar, there goes the
American flag; where goes the
American flag, there go American
men." He pointed out that the audi
ence had resented the sequence.

the war.
LOOK AT ECONOMICS
The minority looks upon this at
titude as naive and superficial and
tries to discover an economic ele
ment.
In an overwhelming majority,
however, they want to see the Allies
win. Only a few are fatalistic, doubt
the Allies' motives, and "they are
not very interested in which side
wins," Mellinkoff stated.
Within the national parties Bob
Moulton recounted finding the Dem
ocrats a solid group, while the Re
publicans were divided in the inter
ests of favorite sons.
GUESS CANDIDATE
"Even in the face of disapproval of
the New Deal policy, they will still
vote the Democratic ticket when put
to the test," he remarked of the
Solid South.
From St. John's debaters, Moulton
received the opinion that New York
ers resent Dewey's effort to cash in
throughout the country on his local
reputation. Also they feel that a
great deal of the credit was due
Mayor LaGuardia.
"They are still pro-Roosevelt,"
was his opinion of Garner's home
stale, Texas.
Guessing at the line-ups, Moulton
said, "On the Republican ticket we
will find either Vandenberg or
Dewey; and on the Democratic tick
et either Roosevelt or Hull."
DISLIKES DRAWL
"In order to listen to a southern
drawl, you have to be a man of
leisure," complained Sherman Mel
linkoff, who already had to apolo
gize for his first name and explain
that at least he was from Southern
California.
Mellinkoff quoted one of his debate
opponents as saying, "Where goes
the American dollar, there goes the
American flag; where goes the
American flag, there go American
men." He pointed out that the audi
ence had resented the sequence.
"They are wondering more than
anything else what the outcome will
be and of course wonder implies
hope," Sherman Mellinkoff summed
up undergraduate views of the war
in Europe last night when he and
Bob Moulton addressed the Tuesday
Evening Series on "Students Look
at America."
He said that opinion was divided
into two groups. Some feel that the
dictators arose because of national
maladjustment either economic or
political; but if conditions caused
the dictators, the dictators caused
the war.
