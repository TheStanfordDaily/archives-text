ALLIES PICKED TO WIN
Professor Buck yesterday charac
i terized the German blitzkrieg as "an
j economic and military blunder" that
| would prove to be the first step in
; Germany's inevitable downfall. He
| emphasized, "If I were a gambling
| man I would unhesitatingly place my
! bet on the Allies."
Dr. Thompson refused to be quoted
on the outcome of the conflict. "I'm
I no gambling man," he stated.
Professor Thompson maintained,
"The raid on the Danish ice-box
i will do Germany no lasting good, for
' the Danes are not self-sufficient and
: must be fed by Germany when the
cupboard is bare."
PUBLIC IS INVITED
He declared that he sees no rea
! son for the immediate invasion of
Sweden, saying, "There has been no
boring from within in Sweden to
j compare with the treachery in
I Norway."
Opposing this viewpoint, Dr. Buck
said, "I am dumbfounded that
Sweden has not been invaded yet; I
have been expecting to hear it every
day since the Norwegian attack."
