### FRANK GUTHRIE 
The Boston Red Sox, rumor has it,
or maybe it's a fairly well estab
lished fact, yearly send some of
their prize diamond stock to St.
Mary's College of Moraga, where
they ve even got one of their own
men handling the youngsters. He's
Earl Sheeley, who coaches the Gaels
and is the Red Sox scout during his
free time.
It seems that most of the Gael
baseball aspirants are subsidized
by this American League club, and
at the right time the Red Ilose
can pluck them off and bring them
up to (heir own club or option
them to a farm outfit. Already the
Sox have taken the advice of Shee
ley to sign two of the mainstays of
this year's Phoenix nine, which
won the C.1.1t.A. championship.
Perhaps the fellow with the great
est possibilities of making good in
the "play for pay'' game is their
strong righthander, Emmett O'Neil,
who faced our own Indians on sev
eral occasions—once with Cootie
Thompson in the box—and set them
back on their haunches.
O'Neil was signed first but
Sheeley had another man who
held up the left side of the in
field, A! Lingua at third. In the
only close game with Stanford—
needless to say Thompson was
pitching — Lingua stretched a
three-bagger into a homer, which
gave the Gaels their winning mar
gin. Lingua reports this month
along with O'Neil.
* * *
THIS HAS BEEN the C.I BA. s
best year for turning out pro ball
prospects, among them is our own
Thompson who has had at least a
half-a-dozen scouts"talking to him. |
He seldom pitched a game but what I
someone was found talking money |
with him afterwards.

Only a junior, the Coot lias an
other year as a Card. Despite his
poor luck in the box this year, he
was the most outstanding hurler
<;f the league, save perhaps O'Neil.
The earned-run average ofT
Thompson is prohahly ahout the
lowest in the circuit, for there were
several occasions when he lost
two, three, and four-hit decisions
when his team didn't hit behind
tight hurling.
While both O'Neil and Thompson
are the circuit's outstanding hurl
ers, Mike Koll, the Hear lefty, and
Rudy Ilummes. who put the
Bruins out of reach of the last
place Indians, must be considered
as top-notch men.
Given those lour as our chuckers j
! for an all-C.1.8.A. outfit, we'd have 1
! to have a couple of sterling catchers
to handle their slants. Carl Hobevg,
the big Bear backstopper, would be
I the ideal both for hitting and hand- ;
ling his pitchers; then Engle of
j U.S.C. or Cardozo of St. Mary's |
would be likely subs.
Bill Wright of St. Mary's, one of
the smoothest working first-base
men, would handle that department
on hitting alone, although some
would say Murdock of S. C. has an
edge. Ihe Bears' Captain Duezabou,
whom Arch Jenkins, last year's
sports editor picked on his "all" out
lit, is again the choice at sccond be
cause of his play in all departments.
His teammate Perry would make
an ideal running mate for the key
sack combination, with Lingua hand
ling the hot corner. Our own Norm
Juney would grab an outfield post,
along with S.C.'s Konopka and St. !
Mary's Butler, the guy who's broken j
up a lot of games with his hitting.
A.s an alternate, Roche of Santa j
Clara would get Ihe nod, since he !
wields a heavv bat.

THIS HAS BEEN the C.I BA. s
best year for turning out pro ball
prospects, among them is our own
Thompson who has had at least a
half-a-dozen scouts"talking to him. |
He seldom pitched a game but what I
someone was found talking money |
with him afterwards.

Only a junior, the Coot lias an
other year as a Card. Despite his
poor luck in the box this year, he
was the most outstanding hurler
<;f the league, save perhaps O'Neil.
The earned-run average ofT
Thompson is prohahly ahout the
lowest in the circuit, for there were
several occasions when he lost
two, three, and four-hit decisions
when his team didn't hit behind
tight hurling.
While both O'Neil and Thompson
are the circuit's outstanding hurl
ers, Mike Koll, the Hear lefty, and
Rudy Ilummes. who put the
Bruins out of reach of the last
place Indians, must be considered
as top-notch men.
Given those lour as our chuckers j
! for an all-C.1.8.A. outfit, we'd have 1
! to have a couple of sterling catchers
to handle their slants. Carl Hobevg,
the big Bear backstopper, would be
I the ideal both for hitting and hand- ;
ling his pitchers; then Engle of
j U.S.C. or Cardozo of St. Mary's |
would be likely subs.
Bill Wright of St. Mary's, one of
the smoothest working first-base
men, would handle that department
on hitting alone, although some
would say Murdock of S. C. has an
edge. Ihe Bears' Captain Duezabou,
whom Arch Jenkins, last year's
sports editor picked on his "all" out
lit, is again the choice at sccond be
cause of his play in all departments.
His teammate Perry would make
an ideal running mate for the key
sack combination, with Lingua hand
ling the hot corner. Our own Norm
Juney would grab an outfield post,
along with S.C.'s Konopka and St. !
Mary's Butler, the guy who's broken j
up a lot of games with his hitting.
A.s an alternate, Roche of Santa j
Clara would get Ihe nod, since he !
wields a heavv bat.
The Boston Red Sox, rumor has it,
or maybe it's a fairly well estab
lished fact, yearly send some of
their prize diamond stock to St.
Mary's College of Moraga, where
they ve even got one of their own
men handling the youngsters. He's
Earl Sheeley, who coaches the Gaels
and is the Red Sox scout during his
free time.
It seems that most of the Gael
baseball aspirants are subsidized
by this American League club, and
at the right time the Red Ilose
can pluck them off and bring them
up to (heir own club or option
them to a farm outfit. Already the
Sox have taken the advice of Shee
ley to sign two of the mainstays of
this year's Phoenix nine, which
won the C.1.1t.A. championship.
Perhaps the fellow with the great
est possibilities of making good in
the "play for pay'' game is their
strong righthander, Emmett O'Neil,
who faced our own Indians on sev
eral occasions—once with Cootie
Thompson in the box—and set them
back on their haunches.

While both O'Neil and Thompson
are the circuit's outstanding hurl
ers, Mike Koll, the Hear lefty, and
Rudy Ilummes. who put the
Bruins out of reach of the last
place Indians, must be considered
as top-notch men.
Given those lour as our chuckers j
! for an all-C.1.8.A. outfit, we'd have 1
! to have a couple of sterling catchers
to handle their slants. Carl Hobevg,
the big Bear backstopper, would be
I the ideal both for hitting and hand- ;
ling his pitchers; then Engle of
j U.S.C. or Cardozo of St. Mary's |
would be likely subs.
Bill Wright of St. Mary's, one of
the smoothest working first-base
men, would handle that department
on hitting alone, although some
would say Murdock of S. C. has an
edge. Ihe Bears' Captain Duezabou,
whom Arch Jenkins, last year's
sports editor picked on his "all" out
lit, is again the choice at sccond be
cause of his play in all departments.
His teammate Perry would make
an ideal running mate for the key
sack combination, with Lingua hand
ling the hot corner. Our own Norm
Juney would grab an outfield post,
along with S.C.'s Konopka and St. !
Mary's Butler, the guy who's broken j
up a lot of games with his hitting.
A.s an alternate, Roche of Santa j
Clara would get Ihe nod, since he !
wields a heavv bat.
