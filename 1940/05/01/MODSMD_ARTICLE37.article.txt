# Card Nine Rests; Post-season Practice Set for Next Week
## 
### 
Coach Ilarry YVolter is giving his basehallers a rest this week follow
ing a long and hectic season, hut next week the club, minus those who
have turned out for other sports, will be back at work in the Sunken
Diamond.
Several games have been scheduled with the MofTat Field nine and

Wolter is hoping that the extra ex-,
perience under fire will stand his
boys ui good stead when next sea
son rolls around.
CATCHERS RETURN
At this very moment Wolter
could make up nearly a veteran
team just from the fellows who were
sophomores or juniors on this year's
outfit. Behind the plate, for instance,
Jack Randall and Herb Atkinson
return for more action next year, al
though Sid Lewis, who started the
year as first-string receiver, grad
â–  nates.
Hal Costello at first base played
somewhat erratic ball this year, but
near the end ol the season lie picked
up considerably. He will return for
another year of competition.
BOONE WILL BE BACK
At second base Harry Parsons,
who started most of the games this
year, has two more years of compe
tition left at Stanford. Monte Pl'yl,
short stop, and Elton Boone, third
sacker, are both juniors.
In the outfield Alec Cereghino is
about the only regular who will re
turn. although Milt Vucinich, Frank
Pl'yl, Bob Templeton, and Jim Ver
dieck, each of whom had his turn
in the pastures this season, will all
come back for more action next
season.
Add to the aforementioned dia
mondmen the frosh standouts and
next year's junior college transfers,
and you might visualize what Stan
ford's baseball team will look like
in 1941.
