# Coach Moves Verdieck From Line to Backfield
## 
### JERRY BRUCKER 
Jim Verdieck came out for his
first day of spring football yes
terday along with five other ex
members of Harry Walter's base
ball team to find that lie is a back,
, not a center.
Named the best Indian on the
field in several games last year, the
tugged blond former center is learn
i ing the intricate backfield assign
ments of the Shaughnessy system.
The shift will leave the center posi
tion open for a dogfight between
Doug Stahle, reserve last fall, and
i Vic Lindskog, husky transfer from
Santa Ana Junior College.
SCRIMMAGES SLATED
Coach Shaughnessy announced
last night that, starting in this after
noon's secret workout, the squad will
scrimmage for 45 minutes every
practice day. Starting next week the
team will go on a four-drills-a-week
schedule, with the regular Tuesday
j open session, and closed practices on
Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fri
days.
Commenting on the squad's show
ing after ten days of practice, the
new Indian drillmaster said that the
club looked "very green," but that
: it worked well and showed a lot of
; enthusiasm.
ONLOOKERS PRESENT
Another large crowd watched yes
terday's workout from the bleachers
beside the practice gridiron. It
i looked as though there would be a
i scrum when a couple of managers
carried the red jerseys onto the
| field, but the shirts went back to the
' bench and the squad continued to
i iun through plays.
Chapter one of yesterday's pro
i gram was devoted to fundamentals.
â–  The team was split into four groups
i to practice blocking, tackling, and
] ball - handling under assistant
! coaches Phi! Bengtson, Jim Law
! son, Harry Shipkey, Marchy
i Schwartz, Bernie Masterson. and
