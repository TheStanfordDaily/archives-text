# Girard Ready for S.C. Meet
## 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Mushy Girard proved to his coach
yesterday in practice that his leg has
j completely healed and that he ought
to be ready to help his buddy, Paul
Moore, fight off the U.S.C. distance
aces, Louie Zamperini and Leroy
I Weed, come next Saturday after
j noon.
Giiaid ran a half-mile in around
, two minutes flat. This in itself
| was no accomplishment, but the
j way Mush' came winging off in
j (he final turn and really poured it
! l)n Phased Coach Bill Ellington.
As meet time approaches the ten
sion mounts and all news from the
South concerning the Trojans'
strength is vague and conflicting.
Certain is the fact that Clarke Mal

lery, second best U.S.C. high-jump
er, who soared ti feet 7 inches last
Saturday, will definitely not com
pete. Mai lery was badly shaken up
in an automobile accident and his
absence is bound to help the Car
dinal cause somewhat.
Just how fast Weed and Zampe
rini are prepared to run against
Girard and Moore is hard to de
termine. They obviously loafed Sat
urday, running the mile in 4:28, but
observers claim they had to run
about 100 yards farther than a mile
because of a miniature lake that
flooded the track.
Farm fires cause an average loss
in the United States of $7,500 yearly.
