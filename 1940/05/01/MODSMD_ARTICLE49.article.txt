# Tie-Up Kids
## 
### 
WAY down in this morning's Ex-com story
is a sub-committee report that proposes
eventually to revolutionize the Block and Circle
"S" award basis at Stanford.
To the All-American athletes this new plan
that is now in the process of development will
mean little or nothing; to the hard - working,
fairly consistent competitor, it will come to
mean the difference between success and fail
ure in athletics.
At present over-emphasis is paid to compe
titions, especially against California and then
against U.S.C. Because these schools are our
closest (or worst) athletic enemies and because
we derive most of our income from sports en
deavors with them, the tendency has been to
offer premiums for men who come through in
events versus these arch-rivals.
Unfortunately too many athletes "tie up" in
these crucial struggles and much of their failure
to perform up to expectations must be traced
directly to the award policy. Then, too, because
contests with U.S.C. and California do mean
so much to the coaches and to the school itself,
a limited few of the best men perform in these
competitions. That means too little playing time
for men who ordinarily should receive awards
through their abilities in the "preliminary"
tussles.
The important thing is to reward every de
serving athlete without giving the Blocks away.
Taking the stress off one or two competitions
a year would seem to be the biggest step in the
right direction.
