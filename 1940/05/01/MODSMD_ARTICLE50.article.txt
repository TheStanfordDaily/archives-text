# Silver Platter
## 
### 
MUCH has been said about the meaning of
the Stanford Name and a great deal more
will be said, as the University grows older. The
tradition already behind the name, the knowl
edge and learning it stands for, the culture and
poise of the Stanford men and women, the
quality of workmanship of Stanford graduates,
all compose the meaning of the Stanford Name.
The power developed from this myriad of
signicant little points concentrated in the Stan
ford name makes itself felt over the entire coun
try, yes, even over most of the educated world.
But its power, like that of a gun, is greatest at
its muzzle, San Francisco.
The newly made alumni have this fact
brought home to them like a shot when they
leave the protected pastures of the Farm for the
City.
Now, because of a student organization called
Men's Vocational Guidance Committee, the un
dergraduates will have an opportunity to see
this power turned in their direction—to help
them.
Those who have the interest to apply may
arrange interviews with prominent business
leaders in their respective interests, whether it
be law, medicine, or some other field. They will
have an opportunity to discuss the problems of
the business, or necessary requisites to success
fully compete, or the future of the field they
choose to enter.
Here, presented on what is usually termed a
"silver platter," is an opportunity for under
graduates to receive practical information on
the subject by which they ultimately hope to
earn a livelihood.
Here they may take advantage of the power
in the Stanford Name—that power which is able
to reach out and open a door to the knowledge
and advice which these men have and are will
ing to pass it on to us—if we in turn are willing
to put forth sufficient effort to receive it.—G. H.
