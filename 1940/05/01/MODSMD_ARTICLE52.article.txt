# CAMPUS OPINION
## 'OH WHERE, OH WHERE' 
### 
r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
Mr. Mellinkofl in his column has started some
thing that I have been wanting to start for many
months, namely, why do the University's two co
operative enterprises, the Union Cellar, and the Book
store sell their wares at prices that are so out of pro
portion to their quality. The co-op system was ini
tiated in order to save its members money, but Stan
ford, as usual, is different.
Certainly the overhead of the Bookstore or the
Cellar is no greater than that of any store in Palo Alto
or the City, the rent being free and the electricity
costing less than the usual amount. We do not get
much money back in the form of rebates. Where in
hell does it all go?
Affectionately,
Newt Trier, '39
P.S.: My housemother would also like to know
where in hell it all goes.
