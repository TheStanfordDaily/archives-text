### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
NO HARD FEELINGS
IV'EVILLE CHAMBERLAIN is a polite English gen
tleman; we have always known that. But in poli
tics Neville outdoes himself. His international coui'te
sies must surpass the expectations of his most polished
Eaton masters. The rain-fearing Prime Minister has
been insulted beyond the bounds of patience by his
little playmate, Joe Stalin. And Russia has been far
from cordial to the British foreign policy. Even an
English squire has a right to harbor a grudge for
all that.
But Neville doesn't harbor grudges; it isn't gentle
manly. Great Britain is now negotiating an oh-so
friendly trade pact with the Soviet. Isn't that clubby?
World friendship has arrived.
And this generalization is not based on a mere
isolated instance. Neville has proved'his international
good will in a dozen different ways. Just a few weeks
ago the British foreign minister politely overlooked
the Japanese hostility toward England and said that
it would take "very little" to bring the Japanese and
British aims in complete accord. There we have it
again—good will and international amity. Hirohito's
armies may antagonize British interests. But states
men don't harbor grudges. No hard feelings.
It's the Nazi-Soviet accord all over again. Who
would ever have thought that Adolf Hitler, that harsh
tongued power-lord, would ever eat all his nasty words
about Communism? And who would ever have thought
that Joe Stalin, the man of steel, would forget, his
grievances against the Nazis, whom he called "pigs
trying to stick their ugly snouts into the Russian cab
bage patch." And yet Joe and Adolf, militant as they
are, turned out to be very friendly fellows after all.
They patched up their little differences and shook
hands. No hard feelings.

A ND a month or so ago the Japanese foreign min
ister showed that the Occident has nothing on
Oriental manners. Ever since the Russo-Japanese War
the Rising Sun of the Far East has been at swords'
points with Russia. And many harsh words have been
exchanged, not to mention a few hundred shells on
the Russo-Japanese border. But the Japanese foreign
minister forgot all that and hinted that Japan was
about ready for a rapprochement with Stalin and his
buddies. Courteous? Why it's positively gracious.
Mars may run things for the soldiers and the people.
But Emily Post (and cold power-diplomacy) guides
the statesmen's hands.
Critics may point to the irrevocable antagonism be
tween Neville and Adolf. But iust a few months before
the war Neville was assisting Hitler with very tangible
British pounds.
Who knows? Maybe Adolf, Neville, Stalin, and
Benito can get together for a hand of bridge. And
Emperor Hirohito can kibitz, or trade Neville a
parasol for an umbrella. No hard feelings, boys.

A ND a month or so ago the Japanese foreign min
ister showed that the Occident has nothing on
Oriental manners. Ever since the Russo-Japanese War
the Rising Sun of the Far East has been at swords'
points with Russia. And many harsh words have been
exchanged, not to mention a few hundred shells on
the Russo-Japanese border. But the Japanese foreign
minister forgot all that and hinted that Japan was
about ready for a rapprochement with Stalin and his
buddies. Courteous? Why it's positively gracious.
Mars may run things for the soldiers and the people.
But Emily Post (and cold power-diplomacy) guides
the statesmen's hands.
Critics may point to the irrevocable antagonism be
tween Neville and Adolf. But iust a few months before
the war Neville was assisting Hitler with very tangible
British pounds.
Who knows? Maybe Adolf, Neville, Stalin, and
Benito can get together for a hand of bridge. And
Emperor Hirohito can kibitz, or trade Neville a
parasol for an umbrella. No hard feelings, boys.
NO HARD FEELINGS
IV'EVILLE CHAMBERLAIN is a polite English gen
tleman; we have always known that. But in poli
tics Neville outdoes himself. His international coui'te
sies must surpass the expectations of his most polished
Eaton masters. The rain-fearing Prime Minister has
been insulted beyond the bounds of patience by his
little playmate, Joe Stalin. And Russia has been far
from cordial to the British foreign policy. Even an
English squire has a right to harbor a grudge for
all that.
But Neville doesn't harbor grudges; it isn't gentle
manly. Great Britain is now negotiating an oh-so
friendly trade pact with the Soviet. Isn't that clubby?
World friendship has arrived.
And this generalization is not based on a mere
isolated instance. Neville has proved'his international
good will in a dozen different ways. Just a few weeks
ago the British foreign minister politely overlooked
the Japanese hostility toward England and said that
it would take "very little" to bring the Japanese and
British aims in complete accord. There we have it
again—good will and international amity. Hirohito's
armies may antagonize British interests. But states
men don't harbor grudges. No hard feelings.
It's the Nazi-Soviet accord all over again. Who
would ever have thought that Adolf Hitler, that harsh
tongued power-lord, would ever eat all his nasty words
about Communism? And who would ever have thought
that Joe Stalin, the man of steel, would forget, his
grievances against the Nazis, whom he called "pigs
trying to stick their ugly snouts into the Russian cab
bage patch." And yet Joe and Adolf, militant as they
are, turned out to be very friendly fellows after all.
They patched up their little differences and shook
hands. No hard feelings.
