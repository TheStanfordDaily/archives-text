### DOUG JAQUES 
TRICK OF THE WEEK
The Zetes were going to have a little party down at
Rio Del Mar starting Friday afternoon. He wanted to
go with them, but he had a lab that afternoon. He
couldn't make it.
But there are ways and means. What do you think
they have the Men's Health Service for? Yes, that's
what he thought.
Ho mussed up his hair and put soap in his eyes to
make them red, and went over to the B.A.C. "I got
a lab today, and look at me," he said.
"Sit down quick," the doctor said, and grabbed for
his thermometer.
lie took the thermometer from the guy's mouth
and read it. Perfectly normal. The doctor gave the
guy a test or two. Nothing wrong.
"Well," the doctor said, "I can't find anything
wrong, hut you look had. You look awful had. You
better go to the Rest Home."
There was nothing to he done. The guy had to
go to the Rest Home. He called up his house. "I
can't make it. hoys. I'm in the Rest Home."
But that night he got thinking about Rio Del
Mar and the party and the brew. Something had to
be done. It was nearly 10 o'clock when he got
the idea.
He knotted two sheets together, strung them out
the window, and climbed out. Simple, just like that.
Stanford women note.
He picked up his girl, roared down to Rio Del Mar,
rolled around a while, and roared back, in time to
make a 2:30.
Now the problem of getting back in the Rest Home
unobserved came up. He threw a rock at a second
story window, hoping to wake someone up.
No one up there woke up. but every dog in the
neighborhood did. and the dogs came around yapping
and woke everyone on the first floor up.
"(let the hell out of here," they said. '"We're
trying to sleep, and sick or lazy besides."
Then the second story woke up. That left only
Mrs. Allen asleep. The guy explained the deal to
the second story men, and they tossed down the
knotted sheets.
While the dogs harked and yowled and the lirst
and second story men blasphemed, he climbed up
the sheets hand over hand.
Mrs. Allen dreamed that there was a war and
the Rest Home was being invaded by Russian
Cossacks with their wolf hounds. Or something
like that.
