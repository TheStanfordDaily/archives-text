"DECADE, 1929-1939," by Ste
phen Long street. Random House.
The object of this book is to give
a panorama of the "Threadbare
Thirties" through the eyes of a typ
ical American family. Longstreet has
picked as a "typical" big industrial
family of the robber baron era,
which is wiped out by the crash.
Founder of this family is John
Christian Rowlandson, called "The
Old One," who begins the book at
the age of 88 and ends it hale and
salty at 98. The family consists of
his son, Peter; his granddaughters,
Mary Eddy and Fern; his great
grandchildren, Chris, Jane and Ste
phen. Also present are Mary Eddy's
husband, Fern's husband, Fern's
husband's second wife, several
family friends and acquaintances,
and a few faithful retainers and rel
atives.
The fault of the book lies in Long
street's love for his material and
fabulous characters. In an attempt
to achieve bigness he overdelineates,
only to sprawl.
There are too many incidents of
our time dragged in to touch the
life of the family, too many minor
characters obviously taken from
real life, too many significant asides.
However, "Decade" is Longstreet's
first novel, and it gives promise of
better books to come. He is an ex
cellent story-teller. When he
learns to take a firm hand with his
plots and characters, he should turn
out some rattling good books.
Best thing in the story is Peter's
comment about a Hearst-like pub
lisher with Fascist leanings. He mut
ters, "That man has strange ants in
his cosmic pants."â€”Nowell
