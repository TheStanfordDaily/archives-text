# Daily Rechecks Smokers' Poll
## Validity of Survey Proved by Recount 
### 
The Stanford Daily's opinion sur
veys have been proved a reliable
barometer of student, opinion.
Results of a test question asked in
a study completed last week differed
by only 1 per cent from the results
of a similar survey on the same
question last month. Asked, "Do you
smoke regularly?" 54 per cent of the
students questioned in the first sur
vey answered "Yes"; in the second
survey 53 per cent answered "yes."
The slight variation of 1 per cent
is indicative of the reliability of the
survey.
SCIENTIFIC POLL
The cross-section of the campus is
compiled scientifically using the
weighted method. Similar methods
are used by George Gallup and For
tune magazine for their national
polls.
To compile the Stanford cross
section a staff of Daily reporters went
through the Bawlout, listing each
student in various categories—man
or woman; Row, Hall, or independ
ent; and class. All graduate stu
dents were placed in one classifica
tion, after subtracting those attend
ing medical or nursing school in San
Francisco and the Hopkins Marine
Station at Pacific Gi'ove. The survey
represents only campus opinion.
PERCENTAGE BASIS
After tabulations were complete,
each classification was alloted a
certain percentage of the total
sample. Thus, each classified group
is polled in proportion to its total
representation on campus.
As an example, there are about
565 sophomores registered. Thus, 18
per cent of the total sample is com
posed of sophomores. The cross
section is then broken down ac
cording to sex; 66 per cent arc men,
44 per cent women. Then divisions
are made according to living affilia
tions. When completed, the sopho
more representation in the total
sample is as follows:
Percent-
Men: ago
Fraternities 5
Halls 4
Independents 3
Women:
Sororities 2
Halls 3
Independents 1
(Independents are students living
in private homes on or off campus.)

certain percentage of the total
sample. Thus, each classified group
is polled in proportion to its total
representation on campus.
As an example, there are about
565 sophomores registered. Thus, 18
per cent of the total sample is com
posed of sophomores. The cross
section is then broken down ac
cording to sex; 66 per cent arc men,
44 per cent women. Then divisions
are made according to living affilia
tions. When completed, the sopho
more representation in the total
sample is as follows:
Percent-
Men: ago
Fraternities 5
Halls 4
Independents 3
Women:
Sororities 2
Halls 3
Independents 1
(Independents are students living
in private homes on or off campus.)
The Stanford Daily's opinion sur
veys have been proved a reliable
barometer of student, opinion.
Results of a test question asked in
a study completed last week differed
by only 1 per cent from the results
of a similar survey on the same
question last month. Asked, "Do you
smoke regularly?" 54 per cent of the
students questioned in the first sur
vey answered "Yes"; in the second
survey 53 per cent answered "yes."
The slight variation of 1 per cent
is indicative of the reliability of the
survey.
SCIENTIFIC POLL
The cross-section of the campus is
compiled scientifically using the
weighted method. Similar methods
are used by George Gallup and For
tune magazine for their national
polls.
To compile the Stanford cross
section a staff of Daily reporters went
through the Bawlout, listing each
student in various categories—man
or woman; Row, Hall, or independ
ent; and class. All graduate stu
dents were placed in one classifica
tion, after subtracting those attend
ing medical or nursing school in San
Francisco and the Hopkins Marine
Station at Pacific Gi'ove. The survey
represents only campus opinion.
PERCENTAGE BASIS
After tabulations were complete,
each classification was alloted a
certain percentage of the total
sample. Thus, each classified group
is polled in proportion to its total
representation on campus.
As an example, there are about
565 sophomores registered. Thus, 18
per cent of the total sample is com
posed of sophomores. The cross
section is then broken down ac
cording to sex; 66 per cent arc men,
44 per cent women. Then divisions
are made according to living affilia
tions. When completed, the sopho

sample is as follows:
