### WILSON CANNON 
COME of those "Trojan horses" j
were turned out of the Balkans
and sent back to German pastures I
yesterday.
Rumania ;ind neighboring Jugo
slavia made strong precautions |
against any Reich group when they |
moved to deport almost 500 "unde
sirable aliens" from their national
boundaries.
As indicated in this column earlier
in the week, Hitler has been lavish
in his efforts to ignite the Balkan
powder keg. His "matches" have
been German commercial men. Sent
to scout, minor neutral nations
throughout Europe and to advertise
the wares of Hitlerism.
Prediction at that time held
that these nations would take um
brage at the Nazi attempt, would
take steps to oust the German
"wooden horses."
Last night discovery of a plot
against the Rumanian government
of Prime Minister George Tatarescu
was reported in Bucharest. It was
followed by a police move calcu
lated to deport 300 suspectcd per
sons, most of whom were Germans.
* * Â«
INTERNATIONAL significance of
the plot was that it was timed to
coincide with a similar movement in
Jugoslavia. Certain foreign corre
spondents claimed tension was keen
in the entire Balkan area.
Rumania's King Carol II and
Prince Paul, regent of Jugoslavia,
met secretly at the frontier. Their
discussion, grave with apprehension,
dealt with the internal movements
menacing their respective countries.
Rumanian secret police were un
derstood to have tracked down a
plan to "force important govern
ment changes."
Following the exposure of the
plot, the government took extraor
dinary military steps. Precautions
included posting of troops around
government and public buildings,
government radio stations, air
ports and air fields.
Sixty "mysterious strangers" were
reported to have been rounded up
in the vital oil region of Rumania.
(Funny thing, most of the German
agents rounded tip in recent days
have been masquerading as oil men.)
Police in Bucharest followed this
action by submitting names of 300
persons and recommending that they
be expelled from the country.
Majority of the persons on the list
were believed to be Germans or
German agents of other nationality.

A CROSS the Atlantic and on the
other side of this American con
tinent California's Governor Olson
predicted that President Roosevelt
would accept a third-term nomina
tion as a result of popular demand.
Urging his state to fall in the
Rooscveltian line, Olson claimed that
the primary election ticket pledged
to Vice-President Garner was
nothing but a farce.
Mr. Olson had an inspirational
field day.
Bringing to mind the time-hon
ored "don't change horses in mid
stream" maxim, he told listeners ol
a state-wide radio broadcast thai
Roosevelt is the man for 1940. He
charged voters to "demand" the
President's re-election.
(G.O.P. listeners audibly won
dered whether it would take a pub
lic demand to bring Mr. Roosevelt's
hat into the ring.)
Undeterred by thoughts of polit
ical revenge, Olson declared thai
left wing elements headed b>
Lieut.-Gov. Ellis Patterson made i
"great mistake" in forming a slate
opposing ihe President.
Referring to this ticket, the
Governor found that "Its inspira
tion is so far to the left as to run
quite beyond the furthest left
wing of the Democratic party."
Sparing no punches, Olson tit
tered at the Patterson group's at
tempt to appeal for labor sup
port.
"Those mugs," said he in effect
"seem to have forgotten that Roose
velt has been pulling labor behinc
him for eight years. He's the mar
labor will vote for."
