Sir Noel had gone to Chigi palace
to explain to Ciano Britain's an
nouncement of last night ordering all
British shipping out of the Mediter
ranean because of Italy's menacing
attitude and openly-voiced threats
to enter the war on Germany's side.
Despite the assurances of Musso
lini and Ciano, these threats contin
ued today and the ultra-Fascist
commentator "Blackshirt," writing
in the Fascist party organ Resto del
Carlino, said Italy, confident of a
German victory over the Allies, will
"march when the right moment
comes."
TIME APPROACHES
The time is approaching, he said,
when Italy will reap the harvest of
her long years of intensive prepara
tions.
Other developments today in the
swiftly moving international situa
tion in which Italy plays a part in
cluded:
1. All belligerents in the present
European conflict have given pri
vate assurances to the Holy Sec that,
they will refrain from bombing
Rome, even though Italy enters the
war, the United Press was told by
an authoritative source.
2. Coincident with a British Ad
miralty order barring the Mediter
ranean to British merchant ships in
transit because of Italy's alleged
threatening attitude, it was learned
that flying boats of British Imperial
Airways had been ordered to short
en their stop at Lake Bracciano out
side Rome. Formerly the giant fly
ing boats remained there overnight
on the route between Alexandria
and Southampton; now they will re
fuel only.
