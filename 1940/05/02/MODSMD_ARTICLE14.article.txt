# Brandt Decries U.S. Attitudes
## Professor Demands Peace Co-operation 
### 
"Peace requires co-operation, not |
isolation. If the United States thinks
that she can live in an obstruction- !
ist, isolated world by herself, she is
belligerent and conceited and
thoughtless," opined Dr. Karl Brandt
yesterday when he spoke at Lunch
eon Club.
Stressing the incongruity of our
domestic democratic policy of co
operation and our international plan
of economic isolation, Dr. Brandt em
phasized America's responsibility to
the world of nations.
A peaceful rearrangement for a
co-opcrative exchange of goods and
services by sharing and trading was
presented as a solution to world
wide war. The Stanford professor
expressed himself as discouraged to
see a nation that purportedly wants
peace, take the smug, isolationist at
titude.
"We are in the world's activities;
we cannot shut ourselves away,"
pointed out Dr. Brand). "It is a great
illusion to think that we can get
along by ourselves and foster an in
ternational rise in the standard of
living."
A United States resident for seven
years, Dr. Brandt was formerly a
professor at the University of Ber
lin and an adviser on natural re
sources for the German govern
ment. At Stanford he is a professor
of agriculture in the Food Research
Institute.
