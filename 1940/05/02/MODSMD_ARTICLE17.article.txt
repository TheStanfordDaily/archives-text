A chance for men students to interview San Francisco business and
professional leaders is being offered this quarter by the Men's Vocational
Guidance Committee. Groups of three or four students will travel to San
Francisco every Wednesday and Thursday throughout May for this
purpose.
Frank Mallory, chairman of the committee in the absence of Bruce

Jessup, emphasized yesterday that
these interviews have been arranged
to give students a chance to gain
first-hand information about a cer
tain business or profession, and not
to establish contacts for students de
siring employment.

the committee in collaboration with
the San Francisco Rotary Club,

especially suited to advise them.
