# Trustee Asks 'Farm Family' Push in Drive
## Soph Carnival Opens Week's Festivities; Children Will Benefit 
### 
With all committee appointments
officially okayed now by Excom, the
annual Convalescent Home Drive is
gathering momentum for next week's
Big Push under Chairman Ned Pugh.
Tomorrow night's Soph Carnival
will start Home Drive activities.
Monday will be Tag Day, Tuesday
is scheduled to be Bean Day which
will be held in conjunction with the
Strawberry Brunch, Wednesday will
be Labor Day, Thursday's feature
will be an air show at the Palo Alto
airport, while the Junior Water Car-

nival at Lake Lagunita Friday will
end festivities.
OfT-campus drive committeemen
will visit homes in Palo Alto and
nearby towns Monday, Tuesday, and
Wednesday in an effort to solicit
co-operation from alumni and
friends of the University.
STANFORD FAMILY'
The theme this year is the Stan
ford Family and its five component
parts — students, faculty, trustees,
friends, and alumni. Leland Cutler,
president of the Board of Trustees,
has promised to'turn out for next
Wednesday's Labor Day activities—
overalls and all.
"This is significant of the expected
.spirit of this year's Drive," declared
Pugh yesterday. "We think that a
closer feeling of unity will come
from students, faculty, trustees,
alumni, and friends working shoul
der to shoulder.
"Very few persons realize," he con
tinued, "the importance of the Con
valescent Home Drive. By our con
tributions, 80 children between the
ages of 4 and 12 from destitute fam
ilies are allowed to be nursed back
to health, often from serious and
deadly ailments."
PLEASE SIGN
Because the cost of keeping one
patient at the Con Home for one day
is $2.56, checks made out. for that
amount, will be distributed next
week to the Stanford Family. By
signing one of these checks members
of the Stanford Family will directly
contribute to the support of the Con
Home kids.
Pugh has expressed concern over
results of the way student contribu
tions fell off last year. While off
campus contributions have risen
steadily since 1935, last year dona
tions fell off by a generous percent
age in almost all campus groups.
FRATERNITIES FALL
A comparison of 1939's figures with
j those of the year before show that
I fraternity donations fell off about. 46
i per cent; men's halls, 44 per cent;
! and sororities, 36 per cent. The
! women's halls were the only group
I to show an increase.
"Our aim this year is to restore
i student donations to their old level,"

STANFORD FAMILY'
The theme this year is the Stan
ford Family and its five component
parts — students, faculty, trustees,
friends, and alumni. Leland Cutler,
president of the Board of Trustees,
has promised to'turn out for next
Wednesday's Labor Day activities—
overalls and all.
"This is significant of the expected
.spirit of this year's Drive," declared
Pugh yesterday. "We think that a
closer feeling of unity will come
from students, faculty, trustees,
alumni, and friends working shoul
der to shoulder.
"Very few persons realize," he con
tinued, "the importance of the Con
valescent Home Drive. By our con
tributions, 80 children between the
ages of 4 and 12 from destitute fam
ilies are allowed to be nursed back
to health, often from serious and
deadly ailments."
PLEASE SIGN
Because the cost of keeping one
patient at the Con Home for one day
is $2.56, checks made out. for that
amount, will be distributed next
week to the Stanford Family. By
signing one of these checks members
of the Stanford Family will directly
contribute to the support of the Con
Home kids.
Pugh has expressed concern over
results of the way student contribu
tions fell off last year. While off
campus contributions have risen
steadily since 1935, last year dona
tions fell off by a generous percent
age in almost all campus groups.
FRATERNITIES FALL
A comparison of 1939's figures with
j those of the year before show that
I fraternity donations fell off about. 46
i per cent; men's halls, 44 per cent;
! and sororities, 36 per cent. The
! women's halls were the only group
I to show an increase.
"Our aim this year is to restore
i student donations to their old level,"
