sports clothes, spring dresses, eve
ning gowns, everything is in order
for the Soph Carnival."
STILL A SECRET
A cheek-up last night revealed
that the Zetes were still managing
to keep the identity of their "mys

"We don't promise anything," said
one of the Zete sophomores yester

novel idea. No, I can't tell you any
thing more than that."
Forty organizations are going to
have booths tomorrow night, ac
cording to Kingsbury. Mort Van
Ostrand, in charge of the fraterni
ties, has 23 houses signed up, while
all nine sororities have responded to
Jane Pendergast's urging.
HALLS REPRESENTED

Margaret Harper, head of the wom
en's halls committee, has lined up a
Lagunita concession.

testing booth that they hope will
meet with the approval of the Ad
ministration. The Fijis will take it
out on their pledges in their pie
