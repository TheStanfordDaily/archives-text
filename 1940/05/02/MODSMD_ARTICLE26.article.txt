# Cards Prep for Victory Over Trojans Saturday To Decide Nation's Best
## 
### 
From now until Saturday afternoon at about 2 o'clock in the Los
Angeles Coliseum, where they tangle with a mighty U.S.C. track team to
decide which is the best dual meet cinder team in the country, Stanford's
trackstcrs will taper off with little actual work and plenty of rest.
But yesterday. Coach liill Ellington put his hoys through their paces

in several events with the pressure,
on and a few outstanding times and
distances resulted. The most out
standing one was a 1:52.4 half-mile
turned in by Paul Moore.
Moore won easily from his team
mates, Ernie Clark and Blair Hyde,
in his "best ever" time. Also in the
spotlight was Hyde, who finished in
1:53.4, which would have been good
enough to beat Troy's best in this
distance against California. And
Clark was only a few strides back
in time that approached 1:54 flat.
140 SLUMP
The Card quarter milers contin
ued their so-called "slump" as
Charlie beat teammate Craig
Williamson in time slow for these
boys, 48 flat. But Charlie bounced
back a half hour later with a sizzling
21.3 furlong which serves notice to
the Trojan sprinters, Mickey Ander
son and Barney Willis, to be on their
guard or they will be looking at
the backs of two instead of only one
Stanford man.
Ellington's weightmen continued to
increase their ranges. Stan Ander
sen had three puts over 53 feet and
Bill Trout was close to 51 in the shot.
Don't be surprised if the Cards
sweep their event against Southern
California.
MUSH KI NS TWICE
The rest of the squad worked out
strenuously in their last real prac
tice before the Trojan debacle. The
hardest working trackman now is
"Mush" Girard, who is fighting to
get back in shape for Zamperini and
company. Mush has been running
two times a day, but he and the rest
of the squad will be saving their
strength from now until Saturday.
Ellington is taking a large squad
south, 33 men. which is proof of the
lact that he feels the meet will be
close and that any stray point, or
even fraction, that the Indians can
pick up Saturday might be influen
tial in beating the defending na
tional champions.
