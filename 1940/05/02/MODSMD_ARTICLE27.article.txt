# Card Gridders Get Workout
## 
### 
Coach Clark Shaughnessy gavp
his gridders their first taste of
rough work yesterday afternoon,
sending the squad through a long
slam-hang scrimmage.
Four full teams saw action in the
scrum, held behind closed doors in
secret practice. The "A" and "B"
squads worked against the third and
fourth strings.
It was a typical first scrimmage,
with fumbles galore, haphazard
blocking, and sloppy tackling, but
mixed in with the bad was a lot of
;jood football. Hugh Gallerneau and
Norm Standlee were the only ball
luggers who could break into the
open consistently. Gallerneau,
working at hall on the first string,
iet sail on a couple of wide sweeps
,ood for 20 yards apiece, and slipped
hrough the line for the only tally
jf the afternoon.-
Coach Shaughnessy inserted four
af last fall's frosh linemen into his
'first string." Dick Palmer ;md Ed
McCain held down the guard spots;
Chuck Tiiylor, a reformed quarter
back, was at left tackle, and Hank
Nor berg was at left end. Freddie
Meyer at right end, Jack Warnecke
at right .tackle, and Doug Stable at
center rounded out the first-team
line.
The regular backfield functioned
behind this septet, with Frankie Al
bert at quarter, Gallerneau and Pete
Kmetovic at halves, and Norm
Standlee at full.
A rest is in order today, with
another scrimmage on the docket for
tomorrow afternoon's secret prac
tice. Swede Johansen didn't take
part in yesterday's festivities, the
big tackle still suffering from a bad
leg.
