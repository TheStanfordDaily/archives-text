### FRANK GUTHRIE 
The Class of 1943, bless 'em, didn't
do at all badly in the way of ath
letics this year, considering that th"
number of potential athletes who go
to the Farm do not compare with
the number who go to Cal, U.C.L.A.,
or U.S.C.
The Bears with another one of
their "best ever" football teams
were defeated by a touchdown
margin in the Little Big Game, and
then Beeb Lee's sterling quintet
trounced the Bearcubs in two of
their three games to take the
series.
Jack Weiershauser's trackmen
didn t do as well as their other ath
! letic brethren but they did manage
to keep the meet down to a respect
able score (considering that last
| year's '42ers had more than 100
points Scored against them).
* * *
THE SIX C'ESS of the frosh base
j bailers against Cal was not any bet
ter, although they did take one of
the three games in their annual se
: ries. All the scores, however, were
close, and like most ball games they
could have swung in Stanford's di
■ recti on without much trouble.
Frosh footballers are expected to
provide a few men for varsity ma
terial next fall, and the basketball
squad will probably send up a
couple worthy of first or second
string mention. Track strength
lay with only a couple of fellows,
but baseball promises to give
Coach Harry Wolter more than
something to work into his var
sity line-up next winter.
Jack Dalton, who has covered the
| yearling antics for The Daily out on
! the diamond, will take over from
here, giving you his impression of
1 certain prospects and the season in
I retrospect:
"The freshman baseball team
wound up a successful season last
week-end with a brilliant 4-2 win
over Cal s frosh. Yearling baseball
doesn't get much attention here, but
this year's crew piled up a good
record of 11 wins and .6 defeats and
showed plenty of sparkle at times.
"Handicapped in the early sea
son by relentless rains which
broke up scheduled games and
practices, the Papoose nine drop
ped their first four tilts to four
of San Francisco's strongest high
school clubs.
"Then came an eight-game win
i streak, after which the Cal series
was dropped. 2-1, and tussles were
taken from Menlo Jaysee and
Mountain View. All the Cal strug

gles were close, the yearlings losing
the first two. 15-12 and 3-1.
"Despite (his somewhat erratic
record, several of Harry Shrpkey's
and Art Esslinger's men seem des
tined lo play a big part in reju
venating the varsity next season.
Captain Clark Graham, a smooth
fielding shortstop with plenty of
experience and a good hatting
eye, looks to he the top prospect,
along with speedy Carl Kellcn
bcrger, a centcrficlder with a
knack for extra base clouts. (He's
a sprinter too on Weiehauser's
track squad). Both men hail from
Portland.
"Phi! Wolf, a husky Seattle boy,
carried most of the pitching load
and climaxed the year with a two
hit performance over Cal in the third
tussle. Wolf is big and throws a fast
ball, needing only experience and
confidence to qualify for varsity
competition.

THE SIX C'ESS of the frosh base
j bailers against Cal was not any bet
ter, although they did take one of
the three games in their annual se
: ries. All the scores, however, were
close, and like most ball games they
could have swung in Stanford's di
■ recti on without much trouble.
Frosh footballers are expected to
provide a few men for varsity ma
terial next fall, and the basketball
squad will probably send up a
couple worthy of first or second
string mention. Track strength
lay with only a couple of fellows,
but baseball promises to give
Coach Harry Wolter more than
something to work into his var
sity line-up next winter.
Jack Dalton, who has covered the
| yearling antics for The Daily out on
! the diamond, will take over from
here, giving you his impression of
1 certain prospects and the season in
I retrospect:
"The freshman baseball team
wound up a successful season last
week-end with a brilliant 4-2 win
over Cal s frosh. Yearling baseball
doesn't get much attention here, but
this year's crew piled up a good
record of 11 wins and .6 defeats and
showed plenty of sparkle at times.
"Handicapped in the early sea
son by relentless rains which
broke up scheduled games and
practices, the Papoose nine drop
ped their first four tilts to four
of San Francisco's strongest high
school clubs.
"Then came an eight-game win
i streak, after which the Cal series
was dropped. 2-1, and tussles were
taken from Menlo Jaysee and
Mountain View. All the Cal strug

gles were close, the yearlings losing
the first two. 15-12 and 3-1.
"Despite (his somewhat erratic
record, several of Harry Shrpkey's
and Art Esslinger's men seem des
tined lo play a big part in reju
venating the varsity next season.
Captain Clark Graham, a smooth
fielding shortstop with plenty of
experience and a good hatting
eye, looks to he the top prospect,
along with speedy Carl Kellcn
bcrger, a centcrficlder with a
knack for extra base clouts. (He's
a sprinter too on Weiehauser's
track squad). Both men hail from
Portland.
"Phi! Wolf, a husky Seattle boy,
carried most of the pitching load
and climaxed the year with a two
hit performance over Cal in the third
tussle. Wolf is big and throws a fast
ball, needing only experience and
confidence to qualify for varsity
competition.
The Class of 1943, bless 'em, didn't
do at all badly in the way of ath
letics this year, considering that th"
number of potential athletes who go
to the Farm do not compare with
the number who go to Cal, U.C.L.A.,
or U.S.C.
