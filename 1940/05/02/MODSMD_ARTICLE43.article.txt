SAMUEL HARDEN CHURCH, the eminent
though rabid chairman of the Carnegie
Institute, announced yesterday that he was act
ing as the spokesman of a Pittsburgh group that
was offering a million-dollar reward for the
capture of Adolph Hitler and his delivery alive
into the custody of the League of Nations before
the end of May.
Of course, no one, not even the eminent-rabid
Mr. Church himself, believes that there is any
chance of their offer being accepted except by
little groups of sheep in uniforms who got so
much fun and later so much misery out of their
attempts to capture the Kaiser. The Kaiser, you
will remember, was the original wearer of the
brogans now being goose-stepped around by
the likewise eminent yet rabid Fuehrer.
The president of the Carnegie Institute, which
also sponsors a Foundation for Peace in its spare
moments, is only another in the growing list of
Americans who, either by persuasion or true
conviction, have chosen to place all the blame
for the present debacle on the Germans and
Hitler.
Unfortunately inabilities such as these to
maintain an absolute neutrality can do only one
thing to the United States, lead her surely and
thoroughly into the catastrophe. And any foun
dation, from the expensively garbed Carnegie
clan on down, which refuses to place equal
blame on the Allies and the Germans for start
ing and then refusing to stop a war, is only
greasing the skidway for the death slide of a
country that must and should stay neutral.
The funny thing about the Church declara
tion in the press of the nation is the statement
"Hitler should be delivered for trial before a
high court of justice for his crimes against the
peace and dignity of the civilized world."
The Treaty of Versailles, then, was a civilized
document. The English and the French and the
American Empires were built up for the sheer
benefit of good old civilization.
Poor harassed Adolph, hound that he may be,
is a small part of the atrocity that is Europe
today.
There can be no dignity, no honor in the
present Europe. War in itself is the greatest
crime ever known to civilization. A war with a
dictated peace does not even deserve to be
place in the civilization category.
No, Hitler is no saint, nor are the diplomats
of other countries who fight wars for empire,
who brazenly use the words "democracy,"
"honor," "decency," and even "civilization"
when in reality they should be saying "greed,"
"hate," "propaganda," and "hell."
The only way Mr. Church and his cohorts can
bring order out of the present chaos is by
capturing the whole lot of pseudo-gods over
there, cutting out their tongues and silencing
their propaganda, and then proceeding to keep
their own minds on their little businesses here
at home.

The only way Mr. Church and his cohorts can
bring order out of the present chaos is by
capturing the whole lot of pseudo-gods over
there, cutting out their tongues and silencing
their propaganda, and then proceeding to keep
their own minds on their little businesses here
at home.
SAMUEL HARDEN CHURCH, the eminent
though rabid chairman of the Carnegie
Institute, announced yesterday that he was act
ing as the spokesman of a Pittsburgh group that
was offering a million-dollar reward for the
capture of Adolph Hitler and his delivery alive
into the custody of the League of Nations before
the end of May.
Of course, no one, not even the eminent-rabid
Mr. Church himself, believes that there is any
chance of their offer being accepted except by
little groups of sheep in uniforms who got so
much fun and later so much misery out of their
attempts to capture the Kaiser. The Kaiser, you
will remember, was the original wearer of the
brogans now being goose-stepped around by
the likewise eminent yet rabid Fuehrer.
The president of the Carnegie Institute, which
also sponsors a Foundation for Peace in its spare
moments, is only another in the growing list of
Americans who, either by persuasion or true
conviction, have chosen to place all the blame
for the present debacle on the Germans and
Hitler.
Unfortunately inabilities such as these to
maintain an absolute neutrality can do only one
thing to the United States, lead her surely and
thoroughly into the catastrophe. And any foun
dation, from the expensively garbed Carnegie
clan on down, which refuses to place equal
blame on the Allies and the Germans for start
ing and then refusing to stop a war, is only
greasing the skidway for the death slide of a
country that must and should stay neutral.
The funny thing about the Church declara
tion in the press of the nation is the statement
"Hitler should be delivered for trial before a
high court of justice for his crimes against the
peace and dignity of the civilized world."
The Treaty of Versailles, then, was a civilized
document. The English and the French and the
American Empires were built up for the sheer
benefit of good old civilization.
Poor harassed Adolph, hound that he may be,
is a small part of the atrocity that is Europe
today.
There can be no dignity, no honor in the
present Europe. War in itself is the greatest
crime ever known to civilization. A war with a
dictated peace does not even deserve to be
place in the civilization category.
No, Hitler is no saint, nor are the diplomats
of other countries who fight wars for empire,
who brazenly use the words "democracy,"
"honor," "decency," and even "civilization"
when in reality they should be saying "greed,"
"hate," "propaganda," and "hell."
