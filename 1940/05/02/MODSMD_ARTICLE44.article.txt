# "Challenge to Liberty"

### 
STAUNCH individualists and old-schoolers,
bred in the tradition of laissez-faire, coined a
phrase about competition being the life of trade.
Since the New Deal has re-shaped the pattern
of our economic life somewhat, this old truism
has fallen into disrepute. Moss-coated methods
have no place in the Roosevelt catalogue and
collectivism carries the banner. Co-operation is
out in front and the masses follow along, sing
ing out the responses.
If the Speech and Drama Division had de
signed to prove or disprove the adage about
competition being the life of trade, they could
not have picked a more opportune time to do it.
Offering up their spectacle of "Richard II" on
Memorial Hall stage tonight, and for the two
ensuing evenings, they decided, apparently,
that Richard must needs stand on his own two
legs. He'll need some sturdy support to induce
crowds into Memorial Hall, too.
Tonight's audience, in fact, will probablv be
the largest of the run. In addition to Friday
evening's Soph Carnival, the opening gun in
thr week long barrage of Convalescent Home

activity designed to empty pocketbooks for a
good cause, Richard will find himself compet
ing, too, with Hollywood's local showing of
"G.W.T.W." and a victorious track team storm
ing the walls of Troy. A lot of people will
watch that battle.
If Richard can cram them into Memorial Hall,
Stanford drama—and William Shakespeare—
will have scored some kind of a triumph. If, in
this age, we were still giving gold medals, Rich
ard would have his chance to win one.—D. H.
