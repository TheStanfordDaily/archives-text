ON TO MEXICO

r JPHE EDITOR, SIR:
This is a pragmatic world. We think of ourselves
first. Germany takes Austria, Poland, Denmark, and
on she goes; Italy takes Ethiopia and Albania; Russia
and Japan seek their share of the bounty; and if the
Allies win, you may rest assured that they too will
demand their just share.
In this day of enlightenment, we are suffering under
no illusions. We fully realize that any wars for democ
racy arc somewhat ambiguous in their real meanings.
And furthermore, we are becoming hysterical about
fighting someone's else war in the all-too-near future.
If only there were something strong enough to divert
our attentions from the war-crazed world.
However, and unfortunately, there is nothing of
magnitude capable of saving us, unless it is another
war. Assuming this logic to be true, let us become
wise, not only taking our share, but saving ourselves
from another overseas faux pasâ€”let us take Mexico!
Our Southern Neighbor is tremendously rich in
oil, silver, and many other important resources. She
has outraged us again and again by expropriating
American interests and handing us diplomatic insults.
Let us seek a new frontier; let us develop a new
land, that is at the present moment fairly crying out for
our unemployed and our youth, crying out for devel
opment and enrichment. I say, on to Mexico!
The Texan
