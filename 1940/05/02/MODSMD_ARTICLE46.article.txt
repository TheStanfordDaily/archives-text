# BULL SESSION
## A 						MAN ON THE FLYING TRAPEZE 
### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
COMMITTEE has lor weeks been trying to get a
| deck on the barren side of the Boathouse roof,
to accommodate the spring quarter convergence on
Lagunita. The chief obstacle to the campaign has
been John "Don't Show Optimism" Cobbs, who has
stoutly produced a variety of arguments against the
deck in his capacity as Student Manager.
How fickle is the wheel of fortune! Just one year
ago Mr. Cobbs was a Daily man —our man Johnny.
And at that time he believed in the God- and Man
given pleasures of Stanford's lake. Johnny has been
a man on the flying trapeze; he has swung away from
us—and from his true being. He is a big executive
now; he has lost his freedom. Oh. John, how could you
do this to us—and to yourself?
We reprint what John said when he was still one
! of us. May Fate protect me from such a vacillating
I destiny!
