' A LL of us got a nasty shock yesterday when experts
I announced that they would give the lake just two
! weeks to live. . . . THOSE WHO TAKE THE TRAG
! EDY LIGHTLY DON'T REALIZE THAT SPRING
: QUARTER LIFE AT STANFORD IS BUILT AROUND
| THE LAKE. They don't foresee ihe blight that will
i descend upon our future if Lagunita dries up before
| June.
In the first place, the Junior Water Carnival will
; evaporate with the lake. Even an educated imagina
; tion can't stand up to a water frolic against a back
j ground that would harmonize only with the pyramids.
And if we lose the Water Carnival, we lose one of
our few painless ways of arousing enthusiasm on the
| campus.
The loss of the Carnival is just the beginning of
the trouble. Spring Quarter is traditionally the time
i for romance, AND THE LAKE IS TRADITIONALLY
; THE MACHINERY WHICH WELDS THE YOUNG
HEARTS. Statistics show that romance on the campus
varies directly with the water gauge on the lake. (We
! have no statistics, but the phrase is impressive, and
j besides if there are no statistics, they can't be con
| tradicted.)
Probably THE UNIVERSITY feels that it can get
along very nicely without romance; BUT THAT IS
| A SHORT SIGHTED VIEW. If the chapel bells don't
I ring, there will be no next generation, at least not one
! with the background Stanford requires. And if there
i is no next generation, there can be no University.
Munich was a mere penny-ante poker game. THIS
; IS STARK REALISM.
