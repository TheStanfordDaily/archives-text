### DOUG JAQUES 
Rumor has it thai the senior class is going to hire
the A.K.L. band for their prom.
One half of the people in the class having the in
side dope, the real McCoy claim the A.K.L.'s will be
taking a big risk if they charge more than $23.50 for
their services. Others, with equally good connections,
swear that the class is fat as a pig and could have
Goodman or Miller, but won't take them because they
want to spend the money on an annex to the Libe
fountain as a memoir of '40.
Breakfast will consist chiefly of chicken; which
brings up (he old debate: will it be a full-fledged
chicken?
