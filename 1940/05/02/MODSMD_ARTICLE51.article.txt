There i.s one guv around here with a spring quarter
major who knows what to do with it.
Biology.
It is his iob for the quarter to keep a close watch
on a little red lake up in the hills, observing carefully
all about the wild and free growth around it: grass,
and so forth.
\ estetday he made .1 trip to this spring paradise.
He took .1 can of worm- and a fishing pole along
with him And nothing else
