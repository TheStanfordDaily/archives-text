# 'German Invasion' Subject of Panel
## 
### 
Whether Germany has committed
hei first blunder or has made a wise
strategic move in invading Norway
was the chief point on which Farm
professors Philip W. Buck, Walter
Thompson, and John Masland dif
fered in the International Relations
Society panel discussion yesterday
afternoon.
Dr. Buck held that Germany
should have stuck to her original
position in central Europe until
England decided it cheaper to make
make peace than to dislodge her,
while Dr. Masland believes the Nazis
have a superior advantage as a re
sult of the move. Dr. Thompson re
fused to commit himself.
When asked whether Italy would
enter the war, Dr. Buck likened
Italy's position to that of a duck in
a shooting gallery. "Italy represents
a risk to either side she enters," he
said.
