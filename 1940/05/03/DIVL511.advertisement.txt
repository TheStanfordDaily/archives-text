My Friend, Joe Holmes,
is now a horse
JOK always said when he died he'd like to
become a horse. One day Joe died.
Early this February I saw a horse that looked
like Joe drawing a milk wagon. I sneaked up to
him and whispered, "Is it you, Joe?"
He said, "Yes, and am I happy!" I said,
"Why r Ile said, "I am now wearing a comfort
able collar for the first time in my life. My shirt
collars always used to shrink and irk me. In fact,
one choked me to death. That is why I died!"
Why didn t you tell me about your shirts
sooner?" I exclaimed. "I would have told you
about Arrow shirts. I'hey never shrink out of
Jit! Not even the oxfords."
"Swell," said Joe. "My boss needs a shirt like
that. I'll tell him about the button-down Gordon
oxford. Maybe he'll give me an extra quart of
oats. And, gosh, do I love oats!"
