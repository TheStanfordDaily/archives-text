### WILSON CANNON 
(Note: History 1940 today tells
of an accidental meeting with a
sailor of the U. S. Navy, recently
returned from three years active
service in the Orient. The en
counter occurred in San Fran
cisco.)
r FHE fleet was in town. Although
the Bay Capitol was hardly pay
ing homage to her American sailor
boy heroes, the city was certainly
showing them a good time.
Gobs were flowing through the
streets like water. Home - bound
theater - goers and a thin string of
civilian pedestrians were swallowed
in a happy mass of blue jacketed
navy men.
Shore leave.
This one sailor, his name does
not matter, walked into the room
with two of his buddies. They
had dates. He did not.
He stood out from the rest. Ex
tremely youthful, he might have
been one of us if it had not been
for the uniform he wore.
We watched him. His friends,
blissfully ignoring his appeal for
company, wasted no time in heading
for the dance floor.
He was alone for a long time. His
loneliness was a hard thing to watch.
Finally, we asked him to join us.

iiHPHE Orient? Yes, I've been
there for three years. It's a
good station for a sailor. But a hard
place for an American civilian to
live. Especially in these days."
"How about this talk of Japanese
armament, sailor? We hear a lot
about it over on this side."
"You'd be hearing a lot more if
you were over there, buddy. Es
pecially in the navy. If you take
my word for it those little Japa
nese are up to something.
"They're building ships. Japanese
sailors were razzing us about a half
dozen new superships under con
struction that will control the seas
for the Nippons. But you never sec
any of that sort of work. They're
doing it. in secret."
The music ended and his friends
came back to their table. They
didn't seem to notice that he was
gone.
"How does the American fleet stack
up in the Orient, sailor? Do we hold
any weight?"
He laughed. "Are you kiddin'?
The fleet, is tops over there. No
fooling. No other navy unships a
launch until they find out what we're
going to do.
"One time I remember the French
were plenty sore at something the
Japanese did. The Frenchmen sent
a cruiser across the harbor with or
ders to blow up a Japanese gunboat.
Admiral Yarnell told the French if
they fired a shot he'd sink their
whole bloody navy.
"Admiral Yarnell is the big boss
down there. The French went back
to their moorings."
❖ * »|i
of us remembered a certain
incident, that, happened a while
back. "What about the Panay?
Were you on duty there then?"
"I was there all right. My best
buddy was on board. He was the
sailor who held up the Panay's cap
tain after both legs were splintered
from beneath him. He said it was
hell.
"Their trip hack after (he Pa
nay was gone was pretty bad too.
The Japanese pestered them all the
way. Told them they'd be lucky
to get back alive.
"The officers had a tough job
holding us on ship when we heard
about that. We were ready to whip
anything we saw in a Japanese uni
form. It was so bad that the Japa
nese sailors never went on shore
unless they were in gangs of a hun
dred or more.
"Wo never could understand why
we didn't go to war over that. Our
navy would take them in a month.
But you never can tell about their
new ships. Probably all made with
American scrap iron, too."
"Me going to re-enlist? No sir,
buddy. Going homo to Kansas.
I'm only 20 . . . Finish my educa
tion and then go back as an officer."
