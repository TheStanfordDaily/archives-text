### JERKY MAYER 
Stanford, supposedly "sophisticated" and "blase," will troop into the
Pavilion tonight between 7:30 and 11 o'clock to revel for the benefit of
the Convalescent Home.
It's the annual Sophomore Carnival, three-and-a-half hours of fun and
light-hcartedncss. Where dated couples and non-dates rub elbows while

,roulette wheels click,, dancing feet
shuffle, pledges get unceremoniously
dunked, and darts fly through the
air at hapless balloons.
Tickets good for all the concessions
will bo on sale at the permanent
box office.
At a late hour last night, Zete
sophomores had still managed to
preserve the secret of their mystery
concession. The unveiling of the
Zetes' booth promises to be the high
point of the evening, according to
Pete Kingsbury, chairman of the
Carnival.

last year's funfest have been re

revelries the gayest in recent years,

One of the most interesting of the
new concessions will be the A.K.L.'s
kiss-testing booth, which it Ls re
puted has already stirred the inter
est of many students of both sexes.

puted has already stirred the inter
est of many students of both sexes.
