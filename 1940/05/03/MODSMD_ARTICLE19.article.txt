# Kids' Testimonials Boost Convalescent Home Claim As 'Popular Institution'
## 
### ROSE DOUGLASS 
If enthusiastic fan letters mean j
anything Stanford's Convalescent i
Home might put forward a claim to
the title of "most popular charity j
institution." And its file of letters |
would support this claim.
Carefully preserved by Mrs. Ruth !
At wood, director of the Home, is a i
collection of letters written by the j
children who have been cared for |
there. Their ungrammatical elo- \
quince testifies to the good treat- |
ment, pleasant surroundings, and j
medical care that the Convalescent j
Home offers to the needy children j
of the Bay area.
lIATED TO LEAVE
Muriel's letter expresses the theme
that runs through all these unso- ,
licited testimonials: "Gee, I sure did j
hate to leave the Convalescent Home
—they were so nice to me." An- i
other notes with evident satisfac- j
tion, "Everyone says to me, 'Adolph, j
you look much better now.' "
But even without the letters, the I
good work that the Home is doing, ;
the benefits it offers are self-evident, j
A walk through the grounds and the
various units of the Home show even
the most casual observer that the
service it performs is no negligible
one.
ANTISEPTIC ABSENT
Here is no reek of iodoform, no
antiseptic atmosphere of hospital
routine; instead there are play
houses, pictures, toys, a playground,
sun porches, and school rooms where
the children carry on their studies
under the supervision of the San
Francisco schools, and are provided
with amusement and entertainment.
Of the Home's SO children, 50 are
confined to bed. while the remaining
30 are "runabouts," to use the official
classification. All receive medical
and nursing care, especially suited
for children recovering from seri
ous illness or whose health requires
special attention they would not or
dinarily receive at home.
RECREATION ESSENTIAL
[Recreation and diversion are con
sidered essential in speeding recov
ery. Movies, Mickey Mouse and
Popeye, are the high point of the
week. Boys in the bed unit's toy
band swing out on triangles and
tambourines, or supply a whistling
obligato to the accompaniment of
phonograph records.
Ice-cream cones three times a
week add a note of luxury, while all
meals take on added attraction when

served in the mural-decorated din
ing room.
Wolo, cartoonist for the Chron
icle, has peopled the walls with
madly colored animals of perfect
dispositions and model characters.
Even the penguins eat their cereal
without obvious relish. The only
sad note is the giraffe who is hope
lessly in love with a glamorized fish.
GIFTS RECEIVED
Charitable persons are generous
with gifts of toys and equipment for
the children. A group of Stanford
graduates from Southern California
sends dresses for girls at Christmas
time, and gifts of money maintain
the "Fun Fund" with which toys are
purchased.
Stanford and Palo Alto barbers
come to the home each Sunday to
donate their services to the appre
ciative occupants of the miniature
barber chair. One of the letters in
the files is from Louis to Mr. Blown,
thanking him for the hair-cut and
incidentally asking if dogs have to
have their hair cut.
And the children don't forget.
Only last Christmas, Mrs, Atwood
relates, a clerk in a San Francisco
store recognized her as the director
of the Convalescent Home and ex
plained that he had been one of "her
children" 10 years ago. "You know,"
