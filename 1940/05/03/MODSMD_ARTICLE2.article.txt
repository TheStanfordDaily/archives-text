# Farm Student Pays Less In Tuition, Living Costs
## Survey Indicates Stanford Tuition $112 Less Per Year Than Average 
### BUD AMES 
(111 view of heightened student interest in the possibility that the
University may raise tuition rates, The Stanford Dailv recently con
ducted an inquiry into the rates existent at a few representative pri
vate universities in the East and Mid-West.—The Editor.)

Stanford's tuition is low—sll2 a year lower than the average charged
by seven Eastern and Mid-Western universities of equal scholastic caliber.
A sampling of tuition figures in seven large private universities, namely
the universities of Chicago, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, Prince
ton. and Yale, show their tuitions ranging from $510 to $.'5OO. The average

tuition charged at these schools
$412 for the academic year. The in
stitutions were selected at random
from files in the Registrar's office.
This is $112 more than the $300
which the Stanford student pays for
tuition per year. Community fees,
which exist in all the above univer
sities, have been excluded from the
more specific tuition compilations.
MORE ENROLEES
Tlie number of students support
ing these seven universities, when
the high rate of tuition is consid
ered, shows them with a significant
financial advantage over Stanford.
The seven schools have enrolled an
average 6,613 students, which strong
ly overshadows the 4,577 students
now making checks payable to Stan
ford University.
In other words, a greater number
of students is paying larger average
tuition to support institutions simi
lar to Stanford in the East and
Middle West.
Stanford is also noticeably short
on endowment, when compared to
these seven. Our above-mentioned
friendly rivals record an average
endowment of $66,500,000. which is
equal to $10,499 per student en
rolled. All of these universities have
endowments which exceed that of
the Farm.
ENDOWMENT LESS
Stanford's productive endowment
is $30,100,000, which avei'ages $6,597
per student. As can be seen, this is
approximately $4,000 less than the
figure for the other institutions.
In scholarships, the Farm also
trails the average. The seven sam
pled schools show an average of
$55.45 scholarship support per stu
dent. This is nearly four times as
much assistance as can be offered
by Stanford with its average schol
arship per student standing at $14.90.
One of the aims of any increase in
tuition at Stanford would be to set
aside an additional $50,000 yearly for
aid of students.
On the student side of the picture,
a sampling of living costs in these
seven universities highlights the
fact that Stanford offers more for
less. The Farm's information book
let sets average living and tuition
expenses for the academic year at
$978. The following cost estimates
arc quoted from the information bul
letins published by each of the seven
other colleges:
YALE COSTS $1,600
Yale, estimating all normal costs,
sets the average needed for non
self-supporting students at $1,600,
and the average for self-supporting
students at $1,250. Columbia sets its
estimated living expenses at $1,127.
A step lower, Princeton announces
$1,068 will just about cover costs
for the academic year.
The only university to approach
| Stanford's level was Chicago, which
. estimated $981 was the minimum
! necessary to complete a year. This
j figure does not include the $45 per
I quarter which the Chicago student
I must pay if he wishes to take part in
I university recreations, amusements,
I and to receive publications,
i ' By way of summarizing, it may be
stated that these seven universities,
: with enrollments in excess of Stan
| ford's, exact a higher amount of tui
j tion from each student than does
j Stanford. Each of these colleges is
j more liberally endowed than Stan
i ford, with a consequently greater
| income. And general living ex
penses are lower at Stanford than
i at, any of these universities.
