"All young America is talented
—the untalented person is the ex
ception."
So volunteered Max Reinhardt,
world famous director and producer,
between acts at the opening per
formance of "Richard II" at Memo
iral Hall last night.
"It is just like the performance
here tonight. You at Stanford have
talent to give a production like
'Richard,' with two such good peo
ple for the lead and for Boling
broke."
PLAYERS LAUDED
The players complimented were
Ted Marcuse as Richard and David
Regnery in the part of Bolingbroke.
Mr. Reinhardt also praised Asher
Wilson's performance as the Duke
of York, and expressed surprise that
the actor who played the puttering
nobleman should be so young.
"The sets—who did them?—are in
very good taste." He spoke quietly
and deliberately. "The costumes —
very good. Your theater? Is excel
lent. The acoustics are splendid. Do
you have an amplifier?"
Mr. Reinhardt, who is known over
Europe and America as a producer
whose technique has revolutionized
the theater, is the guest of Dr. Ray
Lyman Wilbur, and. will speak in
formally at. the Little Theater this
afternoon at; 3 o'clock.

of "Richard," Mr. Reinhardt praised
the technical production of the
piece. The scenery changes, the
whole tempo of the production," he
