# Indians Battle Troy
## Card Tracksters Leave This Morning for South 
### CHUCK SMITH 
The name of Zampeiini and the fame of U.S.C. track teams were once
things that aroused awe and respect in the minds of trackmen men
throughout (he country.
This morning at 8 o'clock a Stanford cinder team entrains for Los
Angeles for its annual clash with the runners and jumpers of Tro> with

respect for their opponents, certainly
but with little actual awe.
Reasons for this change of polic;
toward Trojan track teams is th<
lact that the Cards know that Zam
peiini and what he has stood fo:
for the last three years, nameb
Southern California's supremacy 01
the track and field, can be beaten
And that they have the ability t(
take U.S.C. and the man who car
beat the great Zampeiini.
PAUL MOORE AGAIN
Paul Moore will assume the tit It
which belongs rightfully to hin
when he beats Zamp in the mih
and again in the half-mile—the titlt
<>1 the greatest intercollegiate dis
tance man in the country. With hi. 1
victories over the hitherto untouch
able Louis will come the first genu
ine Cardinal victory over a-Trojar
track team since 1929.
In that year Stanford defeatec
U.S.C. 74 to 57 and since then ha*
not taken a genuine victory. The.
only exception to a string of S.C
successes was a G7-64 win by the
1933 Cardinal team which, however
was beaten decisively in a rerneet
the same season.
The Daily Dope Sheet picks the
Indiyns by a G9-G2 score but any
time a prediction puts the scores of
both teams in the sixties, watch out.
So many events are hairline deci
sions and the actual ability of so
many of the performers of both
teams is in doubt that the Card total
might easily rise to as high as 80
or drop to even 50 points.
INJURIES HURT
But it is safe to say that with Sid
Hayes hurdling at his top form and
Mush Girard ready for another of
his 4:12 miles, Coach Bill Ellington's
outfit would be a cinch. With these
two in top form Stanford would be
8 or 10 points richer.
A victory by Paul Moore in the
opening event in the mile run could
start an avalanche of come-throughs
by the Indians. For instance his run
ning mate, Mushy Girard, could
forget that he was laid off for a
week and a half with a cramped
muscle and that he has had to work
out twice a day this past week in
order to get hiri wind and take the
Trojans newly found distance ace,
Lcltoy Weed, in the mile.
Next, little Ken Battaglia could
stick so tightly to Captain Clyde
Jeffrey's flying shadow in both the
100 and 220 that he would take two
seconds, beating out Troy's Willis
and Anderson. And quarter-milers
Charlie Shaw and Craig William
son could show U.S.C. that they are
not members of a world record
breaking relay team for nothing and
run one-two over the great Upton.
CARD POSSIBILITIES
In the half-mile, the fast develop
ing Blair Hyde or Ernie Clark, who
has been shifted by Ellington to
this event from the 440, might sneak
in for even a second behind Paul
Moore and beat the great Zamp, who
was taken by ex-Stanford track
captain Bill McCurdy "last week in
the slow time of 1:57.8.
Dick Simpson, maybe for the sake
<>f the absent Sid Hayes, might run
the low hurdles in time that ap
proaches that 23.9 flight he ran
earlier in the year and break up that
Trojan combine of Laret and Dills.
Out on the field the weight men
are in excellent positions for up
sets. In the shot, hefty Bill Trout
could slip in for a surprise second
behind Stan Andersen. Andy is un
touchable at 53 feet and Trout is ap
proaching the 51 foot 8 inch best
put of Troy's McNeil. Three Stan
ford discus hurlera, Andersen, Am
C'ornett, and Emerson Hiler, have
thrown over 150 feet this week and
all three would have beaten U.S.C.'s
best, Alexander, last week-end.

the same season.
The Daily Dope Sheet picks the
Indiyns by a G9-G2 score but any
time a prediction puts the scores of
both teams in the sixties, watch out.
So many events are hairline deci
sions and the actual ability of so
many of the performers of both
teams is in doubt that the Card total
might easily rise to as high as 80
or drop to even 50 points.
INJURIES HURT
But it is safe to say that with Sid
Hayes hurdling at his top form and
Mush Girard ready for another of
his 4:12 miles, Coach Bill Ellington's
outfit would be a cinch. With these
two in top form Stanford would be
8 or 10 points richer.
A victory by Paul Moore in the
opening event in the mile run could
start an avalanche of come-throughs
by the Indians. For instance his run
ning mate, Mushy Girard, could
forget that he was laid off for a
week and a half with a cramped
muscle and that he has had to work
out twice a day this past week in
order to get hiri wind and take the
Trojans newly found distance ace,
Lcltoy Weed, in the mile.
Next, little Ken Battaglia could
stick so tightly to Captain Clyde
Jeffrey's flying shadow in both the
100 and 220 that he would take two
seconds, beating out Troy's Willis
and Anderson. And quarter-milers
Charlie Shaw and Craig William
son could show U.S.C. that they are
not members of a world record
breaking relay team for nothing and
run one-two over the great Upton.
CARD POSSIBILITIES
In the half-mile, the fast develop
ing Blair Hyde or Ernie Clark, who
has been shifted by Ellington to
this event from the 440, might sneak
in for even a second behind Paul
Moore and beat the great Zamp, who
was taken by ex-Stanford track
captain Bill McCurdy "last week in
the slow time of 1:57.8.
Dick Simpson, maybe for the sake
<>f the absent Sid Hayes, might run
the low hurdles in time that ap
proaches that 23.9 flight he ran
earlier in the year and break up that
Trojan combine of Laret and Dills.
Out on the field the weight men
are in excellent positions for up
sets. In the shot, hefty Bill Trout
could slip in for a surprise second
behind Stan Andersen. Andy is un
touchable at 53 feet and Trout is ap
proaching the 51 foot 8 inch best
put of Troy's McNeil. Three Stan
ford discus hurlera, Andersen, Am
C'ornett, and Emerson Hiler, have
thrown over 150 feet this week and
all three would have beaten U.S.C.'s
best, Alexander, last week-end.
The name of Zampeiini and the fame of U.S.C. track teams were once
things that aroused awe and respect in the minds of trackmen men
throughout (he country.
This morning at 8 o'clock a Stanford cinder team entrains for Los
Angeles for its annual clash with the runners and jumpers of Tro> with

respect for their opponents, certainly
but with little actual awe.
Reasons for this change of polic;
toward Trojan track teams is th<
lact that the Cards know that Zam
peiini and what he has stood fo:
for the last three years, nameb
Southern California's supremacy 01
the track and field, can be beaten
And that they have the ability t(
take U.S.C. and the man who car
beat the great Zampeiini.
PAUL MOORE AGAIN
Paul Moore will assume the tit It
which belongs rightfully to hin
when he beats Zamp in the mih
and again in the half-mile—the titlt
<>1 the greatest intercollegiate dis
tance man in the country. With hi. 1
victories over the hitherto untouch
able Louis will come the first genu
ine Cardinal victory over a-Trojar
track team since 1929.
In that year Stanford defeatec
U.S.C. 74 to 57 and since then ha*
not taken a genuine victory. The.
only exception to a string of S.C

son could show U.S.C. that they are
not members of a world record
breaking relay team for nothing and
run one-two over the great Upton.
CARD POSSIBILITIES
In the half-mile, the fast develop
ing Blair Hyde or Ernie Clark, who
has been shifted by Ellington to
this event from the 440, might sneak
in for even a second behind Paul
Moore and beat the great Zamp, who
was taken by ex-Stanford track
captain Bill McCurdy "last week in
the slow time of 1:57.8.
Dick Simpson, maybe for the sake
<>f the absent Sid Hayes, might run
the low hurdles in time that ap
proaches that 23.9 flight he ran
earlier in the year and break up that
Trojan combine of Laret and Dills.
Out on the field the weight men
are in excellent positions for up
sets. In the shot, hefty Bill Trout
could slip in for a surprise second
behind Stan Andersen. Andy is un
touchable at 53 feet and Trout is ap
proaching the 51 foot 8 inch best
put of Troy's McNeil. Three Stan
ford discus hurlera, Andersen, Am
C'ornett, and Emerson Hiler, have
thrown over 150 feet this week and
all three would have beaten U.S.C.'s
best, Alexander, last week-end.
The name of Zampeiini and the fame of U.S.C. track teams were once
things that aroused awe and respect in the minds of trackmen men
throughout (he country.
This morning at 8 o'clock a Stanford cinder team entrains for Los
Angeles for its annual clash with the runners and jumpers of Tro> with

respect for their opponents, certainly
but with little actual awe.
Reasons for this change of polic;
toward Trojan track teams is th<
lact that the Cards know that Zam
peiini and what he has stood fo:
for the last three years, nameb
Southern California's supremacy 01
the track and field, can be beaten
And that they have the ability t(
take U.S.C. and the man who car
beat the great Zampeiini.
PAUL MOORE AGAIN
Paul Moore will assume the tit It
which belongs rightfully to hin
when he beats Zamp in the mih
and again in the half-mile—the titlt
<>1 the greatest intercollegiate dis
tance man in the country. With hi. 1
victories over the hitherto untouch
able Louis will come the first genu
ine Cardinal victory over a-Trojar
track team since 1929.
In that year Stanford defeatec
U.S.C. 74 to 57 and since then ha*
not taken a genuine victory. The.
only exception to a string of S.C
successes was a G7-64 win by the
1933 Cardinal team which, however
was beaten decisively in a rerneet
the same season.
The Daily Dope Sheet picks the
Indiyns by a G9-G2 score but any
time a prediction puts the scores of
both teams in the sixties, watch out.
So many events are hairline deci
sions and the actual ability of so
many of the performers of both
teams is in doubt that the Card total
might easily rise to as high as 80
or drop to even 50 points.
INJURIES HURT
But it is safe to say that with Sid
Hayes hurdling at his top form and
Mush Girard ready for another of
his 4:12 miles, Coach Bill Ellington's
outfit would be a cinch. With these
two in top form Stanford would be
8 or 10 points richer.
A victory by Paul Moore in the
opening event in the mile run could
start an avalanche of come-throughs
by the Indians. For instance his run
ning mate, Mushy Girard, could
forget that he was laid off for a
week and a half with a cramped
muscle and that he has had to work
out twice a day this past week in
order to get hiri wind and take the
Trojans newly found distance ace,
Lcltoy Weed, in the mile.
Next, little Ken Battaglia could
stick so tightly to Captain Clyde
Jeffrey's flying shadow in both the
100 and 220 that he would take two
seconds, beating out Troy's Willis
and Anderson. And quarter-milers
Charlie Shaw and Craig William
son could show U.S.C. that they are
not members of a world record
breaking relay team for nothing and
run one-two over the great Upton.
