I Once upon a time, back in 193;
j A.D., a bunch of determined Stan
ford trackmen, who were tired ol
J being downtrodden by their Trojar
oppressors, decided to up and slap
I their masters down (and not ever
j bother to pick 'em up.)
So after several undercover
meetings by the hardiest of this
suppressed clan of warriors, they
figured out the ways and means to
cut these Men of Troy down to
(heir own size. They decided they
' would rise up one Saturday af
ternoon in April, 1933 A.D.
At a prearranged signal, which
i was to be one spit from a toy cap
! pistol, the onslaught upon their an-
I cient foes was to begin. On sched
ule, at exactly 2 o'clock, when the
; enemy wasn't looking, one of their
i stalwarts, especially noted for his
; winged feet, made a crack at one of
Ihe foe He immediately sped away
with his opponent in full pursuit.

THE SPORTS RIALTO: Here are
i how some of the times looked in
J 1933 when our Indians last took
j Troy: 100—9.7; 220—21.(5: 440—48.9;
1880 — 1.58; mile — 4:25.3; 2-mile —
9:54.5; high hurdles—l 4.9; low hur
dles—23.7; shot—51:11; discus—lCs2.7;
high jump—6:4':;; broad jump—
23:10'-j: pole vault—l 4 ft.; javelin—
209 ft.; and relay—3:2l.3.
Why, such men as Ed Ablowich
ol U.S.C. in the 440. Art Benavidez
of U.S.C. in (lie mile, Gus Meier of
Stanford in the hurdles; Slinger
Dunn of Stanford in the shot, Les
Hables of Stanford in the sprints,
and Webster of U.S.C. in the half
mile would have little chance of be
ing much better than second or third
men on today's squads.
Of course in that year, Blazin' Ben
Eastman failed to compete in either
quarter or half-mile against the
Trojans in either dual meets, and we
know that he was down under 47* in
the former and around 1:52 in the
latter. Poor Ben, had to bow out of
collegiate competition without being
able to have his hand in defeating
the Trojans.
WASHINGTON. May 2 (UP).—
The Detroit Tigers got off to an early
lead and held it to defeat the Sena

THE SPORTS RIALTO: Here are
i how some of the times looked in
J 1933 when our Indians last took
j Troy: 100—9.7; 220—21.(5: 440—48.9;
1880 — 1.58; mile — 4:25.3; 2-mile —
9:54.5; high hurdles—l 4.9; low hur
dles—23.7; shot—51:11; discus—lCs2.7;
high jump—6:4':;; broad jump—
23:10'-j: pole vault—l 4 ft.; javelin—
209 ft.; and relay—3:2l.3.
Why, such men as Ed Ablowich
ol U.S.C. in the 440. Art Benavidez
of U.S.C. in (lie mile, Gus Meier of
Stanford in the hurdles; Slinger
Dunn of Stanford in the shot, Les
Hables of Stanford in the sprints,
and Webster of U.S.C. in the half
mile would have little chance of be
ing much better than second or third
men on today's squads.
Of course in that year, Blazin' Ben
Eastman failed to compete in either
quarter or half-mile against the
Trojans in either dual meets, and we
know that he was down under 47* in
the former and around 1:52 in the
latter. Poor Ben, had to bow out of
collegiate competition without being
able to have his hand in defeating
the Trojans.
WASHINGTON. May 2 (UP).—
The Detroit Tigers got off to an early
lead and held it to defeat the Sena
tors 5-3 here today.
I Once upon a time, back in 193;
j A.D., a bunch of determined Stan
ford trackmen, who were tired ol
J being downtrodden by their Trojar
oppressors, decided to up and slap
I their masters down (and not ever
j bother to pick 'em up.)
So after several undercover
meetings by the hardiest of this
suppressed clan of warriors, they
figured out the ways and means to
cut these Men of Troy down to
(heir own size. They decided they
' would rise up one Saturday af
ternoon in April, 1933 A.D.
At a prearranged signal, which
i was to be one spit from a toy cap
! pistol, the onslaught upon their an-
I cient foes was to begin. On sched
ule, at exactly 2 o'clock, when the
; enemy wasn't looking, one of their
i stalwarts, especially noted for his
; winged feet, made a crack at one of
Ihe foe He immediately sped away
with his opponent in full pursuit.
