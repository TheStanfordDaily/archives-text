LOUISVILLE, Ky., May 2 (UP).—
A muddy track, dismal skies and a
small field were in prospect tonight
for the GGth running of the $75,000
Kentucky derby as the rival stables
prepared to go through the formal
ity of naming their starters and
drawing post positions.
That little ceremony will be held
in the racing secretary's office to
morrow morning beginning shortly
after dawn but for once it lacked
the curiosity that has been attached
to it in former years. For the names
that will be dropped through the
little white box have been known
most of the week.
