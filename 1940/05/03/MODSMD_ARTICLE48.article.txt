# Out of a Deep Sleep
## 
### 
REGARDLESS of the outcome of the track
meet with U.S.C. tomorrow in Los Angeles,
Coach Bill Ellington and his super squad will
go down in Stanford's athletic history as one of
the greatest and swellest competitive teams of
all time.
Of course, a victory over the almost legend
ary powerful Terrible Trojans would make the
little band of Indians even more renowned in
the future record books. But their exploits to
date certainly are sensational enough for them
to earn a Hall of Fame berth. Whatever hap
pens tomorrow will be another success story
in itself.
This Stanford track team has roused every
Stanford fan on the Coast out of a slumber that
began on a couple of quiet and uninteresting
Saturday afternoons in the fall of 1936. And if
the "assistant coach to nobody" and his men
hadn't filled in the breach, this large lot of Rip
Van Winkles might have been sleeping yet.
Ellington has been bringing results out of a
flock of formerly mediocre athletes in a fashion
which has surprised even his most ardent ad
mirers. The team members themselves have
brought home records and victories never be
fore obtained by a track team of one college.
Naturally enough Ellington is inclined to
praise the runners and jumpers themselves;
they in turn blame their success on his deep
study of track and field techniques and his
willingness to understand and solve their par
ticular problems.
Whatever the key to their combined success,
Stanford owes them a tremendous vote of
thanks for reawakening a Cardinal spirit that
frankly seemed all but dead. It's a pretty safe
bet, too, to say that this aroused enthusiasm
and appreciation won't suffer a whit from the
results of tomorrow's titanic.
A great many of the dope sheets on the Tro
jan feud pick the southern powerhouse gang by
margins of from one to 10 points. Other first
guesses tab the touted Indians by as great a
margin. At any rate, Stanford is no worse than
an even choice, despite the tremendous depth
of the Champions of Cromwell.
It takes 66 points to win the meet. The dope
sheet of the Daily editorial board, authorities all,
gives Stanford 63 points with no points being
tabbed in either the high or low hurdles. That
means that Dick Simpson has only to take one
second in two races, where he will get at least
two seconds or maybe a first and a second, for
the Indians to thump what was the greatest
dual meet track squad of all time.
Prejudiced dope? Well, maybe. But this un
usual Ellington crew has already shown its
tendencies to do the darnedest things.

sheet of the Daily editorial board, authorities all,
gives Stanford 63 points with no points being
tabbed in either the high or low hurdles. That
means that Dick Simpson has only to take one
second in two races, where he will get at least
two seconds or maybe a first and a second, for
the Indians to thump what was the greatest
dual meet track squad of all time.
Prejudiced dope? Well, maybe. But this un
usual Ellington crew has already shown its
tendencies to do the darnedest things.
REGARDLESS of the outcome of the track
meet with U.S.C. tomorrow in Los Angeles,
Coach Bill Ellington and his super squad will
go down in Stanford's athletic history as one of
the greatest and swellest competitive teams of
all time.
Of course, a victory over the almost legend
ary powerful Terrible Trojans would make the
little band of Indians even more renowned in
the future record books. But their exploits to
date certainly are sensational enough for them
to earn a Hall of Fame berth. Whatever hap
pens tomorrow will be another success story
in itself.
This Stanford track team has roused every
Stanford fan on the Coast out of a slumber that
began on a couple of quiet and uninteresting
Saturday afternoons in the fall of 1936. And if
the "assistant coach to nobody" and his men
hadn't filled in the breach, this large lot of Rip
Van Winkles might have been sleeping yet.
Ellington has been bringing results out of a
flock of formerly mediocre athletes in a fashion
which has surprised even his most ardent ad
mirers. The team members themselves have
brought home records and victories never be
fore obtained by a track team of one college.
Naturally enough Ellington is inclined to
praise the runners and jumpers themselves;
they in turn blame their success on his deep
study of track and field techniques and his
willingness to understand and solve their par
ticular problems.
Whatever the key to their combined success,
Stanford owes them a tremendous vote of
thanks for reawakening a Cardinal spirit that
frankly seemed all but dead. It's a pretty safe
bet, too, to say that this aroused enthusiasm
and appreciation won't suffer a whit from the
results of tomorrow's titanic.
A great many of the dope sheets on the Tro
jan feud pick the southern powerhouse gang by
margins of from one to 10 points. Other first
guesses tab the touted Indians by as great a
margin. At any rate, Stanford is no worse than
an even choice, despite the tremendous depth
of the Champions of Cromwell.
