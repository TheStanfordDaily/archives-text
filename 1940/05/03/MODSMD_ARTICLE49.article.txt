# Sound Economy

### 
THE wheels of Stanford's big family machine
are beginning to revolve and to gather mo
mentum for the Farm's most important and final
run of the year, the Convalescent Home Drive.
Next Monday marks the opening of a cam
paign which has long been part of Stanford tra
dition one which gives a great deal of pleas
ure and accomplishes something constructive.
With Monday Tag Day ("tie one on for the
kiddies"), Tuesday Bean Day and Strawberry
Brunch, and Wednesday Work Day for all, Stan
ford not only turns out its pocketbooks but it
turns out part of itself in support of those un
fortunate children who know what it means to
be properly cared for.
In past years, we here on the Farm have done
our part and done it well. Stanford raises on
the average about $5,000, which amounts to
about one-eighth of the total cost of the Home
for one year. But last year all of the campus
living groups except women's halls slacked on
their part, falling below what was their usual
contribution.
The cost of maintaining one child for one day
is 52. 56 or, to put it in terms which the campus
will understand, it is just about one-half the
amount necessary for a pleasurable evening of
dancing and drinking in the City. For those
of a business mind, you can save 52.56 by
spending one night of a week-end on campus
and signing one of the Convalescent Home
checks for 52.56. For sound economy what
could be sounder?—G. H.
