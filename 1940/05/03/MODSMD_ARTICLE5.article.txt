morning at 12 o'clock.
The program, released in the bay
area over KSFO, is one in a series
of Columbia Network broadcasts
originated on January 27 in an effort
to provoke thought on international
problems and world peace. Mod
eled after the Chicago Round Table
Discussions, the Commission's pro
grams have been broadcast from
New York, Boston, Chicago, and
Los Angeles.
Saturday's broadcast will be en
tirely impromptu, with "The World
of Thought" as the general theme.
Numerous sub-topics will be touched
upon, including international co
operation in the sciences and arts
and the potentialities of science for
destruction or progress.
Milton Hildebrand and Adrian
Acock from the University of Cali

lege, and Gardner Waten from San
Jose State will join Livingston iit the
bull session. Jack Watrous, Stan
ford varsity debater, will be one of
the speakers on a similar program
May 11.
"These programs are not designed
for the expression of world-shaking
ideas in half an hour," Livingston
explained. "The chief purpose is
rather to stimulate constructive
thinking on peace by as many people
as possible."
