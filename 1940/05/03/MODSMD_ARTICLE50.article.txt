# CAMPUS OPINION
## CHARCOAL BROILED? 
### 
THE EDITOR, SIl;
A lew days ago a letter, disgustingly written b;
ii non-existent Newt Trier, appeared in the Carnpii:

Opinion column. Ostensibly "Newt" was slamming the
Union enterprises, but it seems to me that bis reasons
are as unfounded as his name.
I say that the food at the Cellar is fit only for the
Gods. ... I claim that the steaks at the Union are
unbeatable and so arc the prices. Well, what do you
say to that, Newt?
As ever,
Bob Williams
P.S.: You will find a number of me in the Bawlout.
