r rilE EDITOR, SIR:
Our Boathouse has become a prima donna. It is
even getting more press space than the vital issue of
fraternity house mothers. And where are the prob
lems of yesterday and of today? The Stanford high
ways are now smooth ribbons of concrete. University
endowments have increased. Tuition is lower. Rooms
rent for a sons. Encina, too, is fireproofed. No longer
do we strain our eyes from bad lighting in the Reserve
Book Room. There, each desk is equipped with indi
vidual polarized lamps shedding ultra-violet light on
tanned intent faces. No longer do we strain our ears
from the back of the big lecture rooms. Acoustically
perfect, they carry every word like a bell. In fact,
nothing remains to improve our academic facilities.
In addition, the issues of life and modern civilization
are now real to us. We eagerly seek the answers to
our problems.
Seriously, is the Boathouse deck a life and death
matter? Or is the campus mind preoccupied with triv
i;d stuff? If we can't find any problems more vital,
college is certainly a pleasant place for the complacent
mind.
