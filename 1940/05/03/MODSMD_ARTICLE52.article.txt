# BULL SESSION
## TUITION AND DEMOCRACY 
### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
AMES, the man who writes so many feature
stories that he is a feature in himself, has hit Ihe
jack-pot again. In this morning's Daily he has the
comparative data on university tuition rates. And his
findings show that Stanford students have the lowest
per capita expense of any high ranking university.
That fact plus the contention that Stanford needs
money badly may prove that the famous $115 should
be upped. tl doesn't seem reasonable that the Admin
istration would consider a tuition raise unless the
mournful bookkeeping numbers pointed in that direc
tion.
But before we admit that raising the price of a
Stanford education is the only way out, every other
avenue of funds should be explored. The fact that
Stanford's tuition is relatively low should' not mean
that tuition is the obvious way to bolster the Farm
treasury. Stanford's low tuition rate means much more
than a saving to Stanford students. It is an important
factor in one of Stanford's most valuable assets—de
mocracy and the informality of the West.
The big eastern schools with which Bud Ames com
pares Stanford may be ahead of Stanford in reputa
tion. And their scholastic standing may be of the
highest. But each of them has expensive aristocracy,
a costly spirit of exclusiveness that detracts from the
broadening advantages of a university—and incidental
ly gives rise to jokes about the "Hahvahd man."

is certainly not a rich man's school.
k There are more self-supporting students on the
Farm than on any of the big-name eastern campi.
And the sons of the rich and the sons of lower middle
class mix more freely and unaffectedly at Stanford
than almost anywhere in the country. Relatively low
education-costs are not the sole reason; Stanford tra
dition and western informality are big contributors to
the feeling of democracy. But as in almost all things,
it is the sad truth that money cannot be counted out as
a factor in the creation of spirit.
An average Princeton student will say that his
minimum yearly expenses hit the $1500 mark. And
when the tariff is that high, democracy loses ground
to exelusivencss. Eastern "aristocrats" may pride them
selves on their elite standing. But actually they miss a
vitalizing influence that few universities with Stan
ford's high standing can give.
All this may be talking around the point, because
in the long run the tyrant-figures of the Stanford
treasury will make the decision. But tuition should
be the last thing from which to solicit funds; it is a
first cousin of democracy.
