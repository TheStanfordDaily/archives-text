# Popper, Carter Present Outstanding Song Recital
## 
### 
Two instructors in music at Stan
ford joined forces yesterday to give
an outstanding recital of romantic
and modern song and piano music.
Dr. Herbert Popper, pianist, and Joel
Carter, baritone, were the two mem
bers of the music stait who proved
themselves most able concertizing
artists.
Mr. Carter, accompanied by Dr.
Popper, opened the program with a
group of contemporary songs by
Michael Head and Jacques Wolfe.
Mr. Carter's voice has unusual range
and was beautifully adapted to the
exotic range of these modern songs.
Beethoven's seldom - performed
song cycle 'An die feme Goliebte"
was given a deeply musical and sin
cere interpretation by Mr. Carter.
Concluding the program, Mr. Car
ter sang a group of songs by Mous
sorgsky, "After the Battle" being
perhaps the most outstanding. The
tragic picture of a battlefield after
the lighting has .topped was effec
tively painted by the rich deep so
nority of Mr. Carter's baritone voice.
Dr. Popper changed roles with
Mi'. Carter twice, presenting three

solo numbers. Schumann's techni
cally intricate "Papillons" gave Dr.
Popper an excellent opportunity to
display his technical as well as mu
sical skill, a chance which he did
not squander.
For his second solo section, he
played his own "Intermezzo," a de
lightful fantasie performed as only a
composer can play his own music.
Max Rogers' "Humoreske," lull of
gaiety and fun, was rendered in a
corresponding light and fanciful
manner. —Sprager
