# 'Wild Bill' Predicts Records, Gets 'Em
## Ellington Chalks Up 13 Years at Stanford 
### HERM SILVERMAN 
Standing at the finish line with
i a cigar clenched between his teeth.
Track Coach Bill Ellington intently
' watched as the first runner hit the
tiipc. Snap went the stop watch.
"Moore, 1:52.4. At-a-boy, Paul.
Nice work, Blair. Hey, Ernie." And
Coach Ellington good - naturedly
; bawls out Ernie Clark for slowing
I down in the stretch. In the next
, practice dash. Clark breaks the tape
: first.
And again Wild Bill's "arm
around-the-shoulder" method proves
I successful.
Wild Bill, for example, offered to
, bet. a new hat that javelin-tosscr
j Bob Stone would be throwing 215
feet during the season—but neither
| Bob nor his father would accept.
Bob has now hit 218 feet.
To top it all off. Wild Bill knows
his track. Just ask the fellows on
the team.
Wild Bill is a busy man on Angell
Field in a slow sort of way; he
saunters across the field to the end
of the half-mile and clocks the
finish; then watches the 220 piac
tice. calls for the hurdlers, and

advises the high jumpers. Always
cool, he drawls his instructions and
then begins chewing on that inevi
table cigar.
After walking about the track,
the short, stocky coach sits down on
a canvas chair near the finish of the
100, wipes the perspiration from a
deeply wrinkled brow. His twinkling
eyes, peering from under bushy
eyebrows, mirror a serious thought
as he says, "We have a good chance
to beat S.C. Losing Sid Hayes will
hurt but the boys are ready and we
should take them."
And defeating the Trojans is per
haps Wild Bill's greatest ambition
since he used to pole vault and run
the half-mile for Sutter High School.
"Those were the days when we
went down to the lumber yard and
got pine 2x4's 14 feet long and made
our own poles," Wild Bill reminisces.
Alter graduating from Vander
nalin's Engineering School in San
Francisco, Wild Bill became a Sut
ter County engineer, but in his spare
time coached basketball, baseball,
and track at Sutter High.
Later he served with the twenty

plenty of action. In the spring of
1927 he landed on campus as assist
ant to Dink Templeton—and he is
still here in a big way.
Puffing slowly on his cigar, Wild
Bill gazed across the Held and in a
voice just a bit husky he told of his
greatest thrill—when, after coach
ing the team for some time during
Dink's illness, he saw Ben Eastman
do 46.4 in the 440 to shatter all rec
ords and to do what was claimed to
be "the impossible."

And again Wild Bill's "arm
around-the-shoulder" method proves
I successful.
Wild Bill, for example, offered to
, bet. a new hat that javelin-tosscr
j Bob Stone would be throwing 215
feet during the season—but neither
| Bob nor his father would accept.
Bob has now hit 218 feet.
To top it all off. Wild Bill knows
his track. Just ask the fellows on
the team.
Wild Bill is a busy man on Angell
Field in a slow sort of way; he
saunters across the field to the end
of the half-mile and clocks the
finish; then watches the 220 piac
tice. calls for the hurdlers, and

advises the high jumpers. Always
cool, he drawls his instructions and
then begins chewing on that inevi
table cigar.
After walking about the track,
the short, stocky coach sits down on
a canvas chair near the finish of the
100, wipes the perspiration from a
deeply wrinkled brow. His twinkling
eyes, peering from under bushy
eyebrows, mirror a serious thought
as he says, "We have a good chance
to beat S.C. Losing Sid Hayes will
hurt but the boys are ready and we
should take them."
And defeating the Trojans is per
haps Wild Bill's greatest ambition
since he used to pole vault and run
the half-mile for Sutter High School.
"Those were the days when we
went down to the lumber yard and
got pine 2x4's 14 feet long and made
our own poles," Wild Bill reminisces.
Alter graduating from Vander
nalin's Engineering School in San
Francisco, Wild Bill became a Sut
ter County engineer, but in his spare
time coached basketball, baseball,
and track at Sutter High.
Later he served with the twenty

plenty of action. In the spring of
1927 he landed on campus as assist
ant to Dink Templeton—and he is
still here in a big way.
Puffing slowly on his cigar, Wild
Bill gazed across the Held and in a
voice just a bit husky he told of his
greatest thrill—when, after coach
ing the team for some time during
Dink's illness, he saw Ben Eastman
do 46.4 in the 440 to shatter all rec
ords and to do what was claimed to
be "the impossible."
Standing at the finish line with
i a cigar clenched between his teeth.
Track Coach Bill Ellington intently
' watched as the first runner hit the
tiipc. Snap went the stop watch.
"Moore, 1:52.4. At-a-boy, Paul.
Nice work, Blair. Hey, Ernie." And
Coach Ellington good - naturedly
; bawls out Ernie Clark for slowing
I down in the stretch. In the next
, practice dash. Clark breaks the tape
: first.
