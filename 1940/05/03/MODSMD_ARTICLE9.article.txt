# Richard II Wins Praise; Cast, Technicians Called Adequate
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Director F. Cowles Strickland, last night, underwent the major, or
Shakespearean test, here at Stanford, when the Division of Speech and
Drama presented its version of Richard 11. He passed the lest.
With fine performances in most of the major parts, and with settings
and costuming hitting a peak in a field wherein all Stanford shows arc

>high, this performance left little to
be asked. It was no professional
performance, to be sure; but the
youth of the cast, while it robbed
them in places of the necessary ma
ture approach, gave them a vigor
| and fire in other places which can
j celled out. of the lack of year.
RICHARD' UNFALTERING
As the weakling Richard who
was never a good king until he lost
his kingdom, Ted Marcuse never
faltered. Foppish and rather foolish
as lie should have been at first., he
rose to his major scenes with all the
dignity and bitterness needed to
make Richard the hero in a play
! where the question of just who is
the hero is moot.
Dave Regnery, as Bolingbroke,
sometimes hero, took his honors,
managing to keep the balance even.
Both were sympathetic characters.
His performance contrasted nicely
with Marc use's—Regnery supplying
the vigorous masculine complement
to Richard's more volatile, passion
ate emotions.
SECOND ROLES
Particularly outstanding in the
secondary roles was Ash Wilson as
Edmund, Duke of York. Superb
diction, combined with a clarity of
reading, made his reading of the
lines at all times clear, though lie
never lost the character he was por
! traying. And of all the older parts,
j he alone was consistently convinc
ing
Also outstanding was J. Edwin Ar
| nold as the Duke of Northumber-
I land. As a whole the rest, of the cast
| was adequate, a few minor roles
outstanding.
