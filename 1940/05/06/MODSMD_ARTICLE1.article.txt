### WILSON CANNON 
A WORLD of tradition fell to
pieces for Britain this week
end.
For centuries the English have
worshipped at their sea-shrine.
They have placed trust and hope in
the first line of British defense . . .
the ships and men of her navy.
Saturday, while Stanford men and
women were listening to the fall of
their track team, the men and
women of England heard the deto
nation which might possibly mean
the finish of their Empire.
English Tommies were going
home from a losing Norwegian
campaign. Proud, confident of
their strength, the English fleet
was standing by.
Then from the skies a drone. And
tiny black specks became huge
brown-winged bombers. On each
wing was the black swastika of the
Reich.
The British fleet cleared for ac
tion. British decks were ringed with
British fighting men.
The deluge came.
And British decks were lined with
dying British sailors. British hopes
for a quick victory in World War II
went flickering with them.

I>UT another, and what may prove
a greater moment of stress, is
now facing Mr. Average English
man.
John Bull has always been noted
for one thing. He can always keep
his head in the face of disaster . . .
even when his kippered herring
turns out to be smelt.
But John Bull and his wife arc
beginning to wonder. They don't
like the umbrella - brandishing
policy of their Prime Minister.
They are about ready to break the
phlegm of normal British politics
and demand something new in the
way of a war machine.
Two weeks ago they thought they
had it. Red-headed Winston Church
ill was put at the helm. And
Churchill is the average English
man's dream of a rough, tough,
fighting man.
Now they're saying that Church
ill was kept tied at the post. That
he couldn't make any major deci
sion without okehs from the Cabinet
and Mr. Chamberlain. Mr. and Mrs.
John Bull are wondering about
that.
The English press is taking a
hand. They are turning pro-Church
ill in the internal strife that is now
shaking Britain. The newspapers
arc clamoring for a free hand for
Churchill in making him absolute
supreme war lord in directing Eng
land's part in World War 11.
One of the bitterest attacks upon
Chamberlain occurred in the usually
well informed Sunday Observer.
Under the heading, "Truth or Os
trichism," the paper said that a new
national government is urgently
needed.
It suggested that an ideal govexn
ment should include labor, the lib
eral faction, and David Lloyd
George, World War premier and
Chamberlain's severest critic.

JJRITAIN' S people are beginning to
lay their cards on the table. And
so far they have all been stacked
against Prime Minister Neville
Chamberlain.
Last week the House of Commons
rang with shouts of "resign, resign,"
as members voiced their disapproval
of what they termed a "wishy
washy war."
This week England is turning
toward internal strife. Some
staunch commoners still hold faith
in Chamberlain and bis policies of
appeasement. But most are pin
ning their hopes on red-headed
Winston Churchill as the man who
can bring the bacon home to
England.
Churchill has indicated that, once
given the helm, the entire mighl of
his nation and her allies will be
thrown against Germany. He
promised, unofficially, that "no more
campaigns will be started . . . then
stopped because of difficulties."
Effusive Mr. Churchill may be the
man to lead England out of the
wilderness.
