# Convalescent Home Fulfills Dream of Senator Stanford
## 
### ROSE DOUGLASS 
It was in 180.'> that Senator Stanford, looking out across the hroad acres
surrounding his home, said to his wife, "The children of California shall
be our children." Symbolically, the room where he stood now represents
the fulfillment of that dream.
This room is the office of the Stanford Convalescent Home, now known

>the world over for its service to
needy children. The earthquake of
1906 destroyed the Stanford man
sion, once a showplace of California.
The one wing left standing has be
come the center of the Home, where
poor children of the Bay area, re
covering from illness, are given the
care and comforts necessary to re
store them to health.
Years passed, but Senator Stan
ford's dream did not die with him,
for in 1917 Dr. D. Charles Gardner,
ihen University chaplain, began the
work that was to give concrete ex
pression to the vision of the Univer
sity's founder.
CHAPLAIN PLANS WORK
"The Campus Auxiliary to the
j Stanford Clinics" was organized un
| der the dii'ection of Dr. Gardner
that year. Joining in the enterprise,
Farm students donated clothes,
money, and personal service for the

benefit of unfortunate children.
Next year marked a step nearer
the realization of a permanent home
for children, when the old Phi
Sigma Kappa house on the campus
was temporarily converted into a
summer camp for crippled children.
HOPKINS DONATES HOME
These first steps were rewarded by
interest and aid from other chari
table persons. Mr. and Mrs. Timo
thy Hopkins gave what was left of
the old Stanford house to the enter
prise, and the University leased
them the surrounding 27-acre plot
for $1 per year. This took care of
15 children.
A few years later accommodation
for 20 more children was made pos
sible with the building of the $50,000
McLaughlin unit, in memory of Mrs.
Dillon McLaughlin. In 1928 the Bab
cock unit was added, followed a
year later by the erection of the
Auxiliary Board Unit.
MANY SERVICES GIVEN
Today the Home provides a va
riety of services for convalescent
children. In the two "bed units" 50
boys and girls whose health does
not permit full activities may carry
on their school work, using special
desks which fit over their beds. The
other 30 children of the Home's 80
live in a separate unit. A class
room is provided for school work,
and they have their own recreation
room and play-yard.
AIDS X 0 CHILDREN
May organizations contribute to
the support of the Home; the San
Francisco Community Chest, and
the Auxiliary Board of the Conval
escent Home, while donations from
philanthropic persons and groups
aid in its maintenance. Stanford
students do no small part in the
annual Convalescent Home Drive.
Much has been achieved since that
day when Senator Stanford gave ex
pression to his vision of helping the
children of California. Today the
Home cares for 80 children; at all
times it is at its capacity, but it
looks forward to the day when no
child will have to be turned away.

be our children." Symbolically, the room where he stood now represents
the fulfillment of that dream.
This room is the office of the Stanford Convalescent Home, now known

>the world over for its service to
needy children. The earthquake of
1906 destroyed the Stanford man
sion, once a showplace of California.
The one wing left standing has be
come the center of the Home, where
poor children of the Bay area, re
covering from illness, are given the
care and comforts necessary to re
store them to health.
Years passed, but Senator Stan
ford's dream did not die with him,
for in 1917 Dr. D. Charles Gardner,
ihen University chaplain, began the
work that was to give concrete ex
pression to the vision of the Univer
sity's founder.
CHAPLAIN PLANS WORK
"The Campus Auxiliary to the
j Stanford Clinics" was organized un
| der the dii'ection of Dr. Gardner
that year. Joining in the enterprise,
Farm students donated clothes,
money, and personal service for the

benefit of unfortunate children.
Next year marked a step nearer
the realization of a permanent home
for children, when the old Phi
Sigma Kappa house on the campus
was temporarily converted into a
summer camp for crippled children.
HOPKINS DONATES HOME
These first steps were rewarded by
interest and aid from other chari
table persons. Mr. and Mrs. Timo
thy Hopkins gave what was left of
the old Stanford house to the enter
prise, and the University leased
them the surrounding 27-acre plot
for $1 per year. This took care of
15 children.
A few years later accommodation
for 20 more children was made pos
sible with the building of the $50,000
McLaughlin unit, in memory of Mrs.
Dillon McLaughlin. In 1928 the Bab
cock unit was added, followed a
year later by the erection of the
Auxiliary Board Unit.
MANY SERVICES GIVEN
Today the Home provides a va
riety of services for convalescent
children. In the two "bed units" 50
boys and girls whose health does
not permit full activities may carry
on their school work, using special
desks which fit over their beds. The
other 30 children of the Home's 80
live in a separate unit. A class
room is provided for school work,
and they have their own recreation
room and play-yard.
AIDS X 0 CHILDREN
May organizations contribute to
the support of the Home; the San
Francisco Community Chest, and
the Auxiliary Board of the Conval
escent Home, while donations from
philanthropic persons and groups
aid in its maintenance. Stanford
students do no small part in the
annual Convalescent Home Drive.
Much has been achieved since that
day when Senator Stanford gave ex
pression to his vision of helping the
children of California. Today the
Home cares for 80 children; at all
times it is at its capacity, but it
looks forward to the day when no
child will have to be turned away.
