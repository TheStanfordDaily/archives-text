## Nazis Jubilant Over Smashing Advances On Norwegian Coast

BERLIN, May 5 (UP). —High
German quartet's boasted tonight
(hat, with Italy being driven
closer to the war on Germany's
side. Great Britain may be "beat
en to her knees" within eight
months in a smashing Nazi vic
tory for which the events in Nor
way were only a rehearsal.
The extravagant prediction of an
early German victory, marked by a
new wave of optimism among the
German people, coincided with a
high command communique describ
ing a rapid mop-up of the Norwe
gian conquest.
German forces have taken Namsos
and Grong along the Norwegian
west coast, while embattled German
units in the iron-ore port of Narvik
have beaten off strong British-
French air and land attacks, the
high command claimed.
The growing confidence of the
Germans is based on the claims of
the last 24 hours that:
1. German planes have bombed
and sunk a 30,000-ton British
battleship oil Namsos (flatly de
nied tonight by the British Ad
miralty).
2. Swift consolidation of the
German hold on Norway.
3. A feeling here that the Allies'
action in strengthening their po
sition in the Mediterranean pushes
Italy closer to war on Germany's
side.
4. A claim that the Allies have
now lost more than 2.000,000 tons
of merchant shipping.
Nazi spokesmen and the press as
serted that the "destruction" of the
British battle fleet — they called it
Hitler's chief aim at present—is be
ing carried out with swiftness. This
will permit the breaking of the
British blockade and tightening of
the counter-blockade around the
British Isles by U-boats and planes,
they claim.
