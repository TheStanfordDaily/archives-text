# Farm, Rotary Vocoms Slate S.F. Interviews
## Men Students Given Chance to Confer With Businessmen 
### 
Men students wishing to sign up J
for the Men's Vocom interviews to |
take place every Wednesday and j
Thursday throughout May should do |
so on the Wednesday, Thursday, or |
Friday preceding, according to an |
announcement made yesterday.
The interviews have been ar
ranged by the Vocom in collabora
tion with the San Francisco Rotary j
Club, which has been active in vo
cational work for a number of years. |
Final plans for the series were made !
last week at a meeting of repre- |
sentatives of both the Stanford ar.d j
Ilotary Vocational Committees.
According to present plans, groups
of three or four students will travel i
to the city and interview leaders in j
whatever field they are interested j
in. The groups will be limited to a j
small number so that each student |
will have personal contact with the '
person interviewed.
The persons to be interviewed will j
be selected mostly from among the j
members of the Rotary Club, which i
includes most of the business and j
professional leaders of San Fran- j
cisco.
The interviews are a part of an
extensive vocational guidance pro
gram started last winter by the Dean !
of Men's office and continued by the
Men's Vocational Committee, which
was formed in February. A.S.S.U. !
President-elect Bruce Jessup is;
chairman of the committee.
All men who wish to participate in I
the interviews should sign up with j
Stanley L. Sharp in the Dean of
Men's office on the days listed above. |
