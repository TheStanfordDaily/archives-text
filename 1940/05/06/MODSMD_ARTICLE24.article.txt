# Biologist Finds New Substance
## Stanford Professor Discovers Chemical 
### 
A new chemical similar in func
tion to haemoglobin in human blood :
has been discovered in the eggs of j
the marine warm Urechis caupo, it
was announced yesterday. The dis
coverer of the substance is N. H.
Horowitz of the Stanford biology '
department.
Scientifically the substance is
known as a respiratory pigment, but
Mr. Horowitz has suggested that it I
be called "urechrome." In the life
chemistry of the marine worm's egg 1
the electron-carrying pigment offers |
a vital service of supply, a transfer
ring of oxygen within the egg.
Horowitz' first clue to the exist- j
ence of the pigment was his obser- :
vation that when the yellow eggs of '
mall females of the Urechis species |
were placed in a vacuum, they '
gradually became pink. He explains 1
this as caused by the oxidized pig
ment taking up electrons.
By a chemical refining process. J
Horowitz was able to extract a few I
milligrams of the pigment from the
eggs. Shaking a solution of it with '
air caused it to oxidize and become j
yellow.
