# Poli Sci Straw Vote Favors Democrats Over Republicans
## 
### 
A straw vote taken in nine political science classes May 2 and 3 dis
closed that students in these classes prefer Democratic rather than Repub
lican candidates for the presidency.
Of the 415 poli sci students who voted. 29 per cent favored Hull. 27
per cent Dewey, and IK per cent Roosevelt. Forty-six and one-half per

.cent of these are Republicans, while
51 j /2 per cent are Democrats.
Political science majors favor
Democrats far more than do political
science students as a whole, and
these majors would nominate Hull
by a far greater majority over
Dewey than would poli sci students
as a whole, who would give Dewey
a very close second.
DEWEY GETS SUPPORT
As indicated by the Daily's scien
tific poll of a month ago, the student
body as a whole does not favor
Democrats as much as the poli sci
students who participated in the
straw vote last Thursday and Fri
day.
Results showed that students in
these poli sci classes who have not
had the elementary course in polit
ical science are for Dewey over
whelmingly, giving him as many
votes as Hull. Roosevelt, and Hoo
ver combined. This compares sub
stantially with the finding of The
Daily poll that 99 per cent of Stan
ford freshmen were against a third
term.
POLL NOT SCIENTIFIC
Dallas Tueller, president of Pi
Sigma Alpha, stated that this poll
does not pretend to be a scientific
sample as was The Daily's poll on
the third term question, but is sim
ply a counting of noses in all polit
ical science classes meeting on
Thursday and Friday, May 2 and 3,
with duplications eliminated. There
were 25 per cent absentees from
class.
The ballot asked two questions:
"'Do you have a standing party
preference (you do not necessarily
have to vote for this party below)?"
and "Regardless of his chances of
nomination or election, whom would
you prefer to have nominated in
1940?"
