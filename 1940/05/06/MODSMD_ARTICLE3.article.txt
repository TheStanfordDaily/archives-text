ROME, May 5 (UP). — Giovanni
Ansaldo, Italian editor who speaks
for Foreign Minister Count Galeazzo
Ciano, today predicted in a nation
wide radio broadcast that Germany
will invade the British Isles and
said such an invasion would have
the blessing of Italy.
Ansaldo, editor of Ciano's Leg
horn newspaper Telegrafo, said that
(he coup dreamed by Napoleon
would finally be realized through the
enormously improved technical
means now at the disposal of the
Germans."
"We would like to presume that
in this year we will see just that —
an invasion of England," Ansaldo
said. "We are witnessing even more
spectacular possibilities of which
some arc shaking the foundations of
| the world."
j Ansaldo's expressed hope and
! prediction followed a blunt warning
i in the Italian press to Great Brit
i ain and France that Italy was de-
I termined to repulse all attacks that
: might be attempted against her.
It was an answer to Prime Minis
ter Neville Chamberlain's announce
ment in British Parliament that the
| Allies were strengthened their fleets
J in the Mediterranean.
Ansaldo said that he believed the
Italian people would emerge from
! the present war greater and more
j powerful than ever before.
The effect of a German invasion of
j England, Ansaldo said, "will be to
j strengthen more and more our soli
i darity and we will come forth from
j this immense crisis with the fullest
| power and greatness."
