# Headless Horseman' Opera Causes Directorial Tug of War
## 
### JAN GOULD 
Mr. Goldschmidt is worried about
his tenors.
Mr. Strickland is worried about
sentimental idiocy.
But after the first full rehearsal
of "The Headless Horseman - ' both
of them are still enthusiastic over
Stanford's first opera, and the hith
erto unheard-of alliance between
music and drama departments in
producing it.
For Shakespeare is just an inci
dent and Chekovs come and go, but
the project closest to the hearts of
the Memorial Hall people is their
experiment in the co-production of
the Benet-Moore satire on May 22.
MUSIC VS. DRAMA
The other night the drama, with
F. Cowles Strickland in its corner,
and music, seconded by Nicholas
Goldschmidt, squared off to decide
the relative importance of 40 stu
dents' singing, or their acting. Re
sult was the slickest teamwork a
majority of the students professed
to have seen in a long time.
While Mr. Goldschmidt, who di
rected the world premiere of the
opera in Easthampton, Long Island,
in 1938, was leaning on his music
stand, Mr. Strickland walked quietly
up and down the back of the stage,
pacing out distances, turning rapidly
in a circle from time to time.
The two directors looked over the
libretto, pointing out comedy spots
and points of difficult harmony to
each other. They studied the diffi
culties of singing an A Capella sour
note —for the playing effect—while
wallowing up from a court curtsey.
"Now what about this chorus?"
Mr. Strickland asked. "We'll have
much more fun with the third verse
than with the second. Second's nice
—but cutsie-wootsie nice. Get it?"
STRICTLY ICKY
"Ja, and in this passage very
sweet, with lots of schmalz. You
like it?"
The rehearsal went on, stopped
every few minutes for interpola
tions by Mr. Strickland, while Mr.
Goldschmidt made concessions to
"projection over the footlights."
Only once was there an impasse.
"These boys come in here," the

: dramatic instructor announced.
; "March to here, break, go over to
the girls, make a pass at them, get
| rebuffed, turn back to here—"
NO PASSES FOR TENORS
"Those boys," Mr. Goldschmidt
declared, "are my tenors, and it is
not good to move them out of their
place in the chorus. The music is
off-balance then."
They worried at the various al
| ternatives, came up finally with a
| solution. "Let the basses make the
passes. Let them all make passes.
If that won't work," Mi-. Strickland
paused, brightened, "I'll think of
I something."
i Two hours later "The Headless
Horseman" was ready, except for the
; matter of smoothing down and prac
| tice, for its one-night stand at Stan
| ford.

NO PASSES FOR TENORS
"Those boys," Mr. Goldschmidt
declared, "are my tenors, and it is
not good to move them out of their
place in the chorus. The music is
off-balance then."
They worried at the various al

passes. Let them all make passes.
If that won't work," Mi-. Strickland
paused, brightened, "I'll think of
I something."

Horseman" was ready, except for the

Mr. Goldschmidt is worried about
his tenors.
Mr. Strickland is worried about
sentimental idiocy.
But after the first full rehearsal
of "The Headless Horseman - ' both
of them are still enthusiastic over
Stanford's first opera, and the hith
erto unheard-of alliance between
music and drama departments in
producing it.
For Shakespeare is just an inci
dent and Chekovs come and go, but
the project closest to the hearts of
the Memorial Hall people is their
experiment in the co-production of
the Benet-Moore satire on May 22.
MUSIC VS. DRAMA
The other night the drama, with
F. Cowles Strickland in its corner,
and music, seconded by Nicholas
Goldschmidt, squared off to decide
the relative importance of 40 stu
dents' singing, or their acting. Re
sult was the slickest teamwork a
majority of the students professed
to have seen in a long time.
While Mr. Goldschmidt, who di
rected the world premiere of the
opera in Easthampton, Long Island,
in 1938, was leaning on his music
stand, Mr. Strickland walked quietly
up and down the back of the stage,
pacing out distances, turning rapidly
in a circle from time to time.
The two directors looked over the
libretto, pointing out comedy spots
and points of difficult harmony to
each other. They studied the diffi
culties of singing an A Capella sour
note —for the playing effect—while
wallowing up from a court curtsey.
"Now what about this chorus?"
Mr. Strickland asked. "We'll have
much more fun with the third verse
than with the second. Second's nice
—but cutsie-wootsie nice. Get it?"
STRICTLY ICKY
"Ja, and in this passage very
sweet, with lots of schmalz. You
like it?"
The rehearsal went on, stopped
every few minutes for interpola
tions by Mr. Strickland, while Mr.
Goldschmidt made concessions to
"projection over the footlights."
