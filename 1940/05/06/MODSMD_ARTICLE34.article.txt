# THIS WEEK WE'LL BEAT THOSE TROJANS
## 
### JERRY BRUCKER 
Don't despair, those of you who
lost your hard-earned coin of the
realm to friends from the nether
legions of the state because of Sat
urday's dual meet loss to Dean
Cromwell's Trojans. Saturday, if
you can renew the bet, you'll prob
ably make a killing.
Bill Ellington's squad will have
a chance to gain hack their lost
prestige when they tangle with
U.S.C. and the rest of the colleges
in the state at the classic Fresno
relays. The Cards have one event,
the one-mile relay, pretty well
salted away, and should he able to
put together enough other quar
tets to give the Southern Cali
fornia untouchables a stilV battle
for top honors in the point de
partment.
At the rate Stan Andersen is im
proving his shot mark from week to
week, he may pick off a couple of
spectators in the stands any day now.
Saturday's titanic 55-foot heave in
the Coliseum bettered his best throw
against Cal by almost 2 feet. If, as
it appears, Big Andy has found a
new compound gear in his right arm,
he might win the N.C.A.A. from the
eastern sensations who break into
print every couple of weeks with 56-
l'oot tosses.
