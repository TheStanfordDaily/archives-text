# FARM GRID FANS HIT JACKPOT
## 
### 
Glancing over next fall's grid
schedule, it looks as though Farm
lans will see more than their share
of games when the 1940 moleskin
season gets under way.
Let's take, for example, a
mythical Stanford freshman nam
ed Archibald. (Mythical because
anyone with a name like that
would have sense enough to de
lete the last five letters.) Archi
bald hardly has time to dodge his
first watcrbag at Encina before
someone sticks a rooter's hat on
his head, jams him in a rumble
seat, and takes him up to see the
September 28 Stanford-U.S.F. con
test at Kezar, the top half of a
gridiron double header.
On the next two Saturdays our
hero, or yours, somebody's got to
claim him, will watch the Card
eleven do battle with Oregon and
Santa Clara in the Stadium. Octo
ber 19 will be a sad day, the only
Saturday in two months that Archi
bald won't see a football game, as
Clark Shaughnessy's squad will be
in Pullman battling the Washington
State Cougars.
()»i October 2(i Archibald will
see the great Trojans meet the
Cards in the Stadium, and on the
following week-end. heeding the
legends of the beauty of women
south of Santa Barbara, he'll hie
himself down to Los Angeles for a
couple of blind dates and a seat at
the U.C.L.A. game. Returning to
the Farm, he'll see Stanford in
action again, yelling himself into
a stupor at the Washington and
Oregon State games in the Sta
dium on November 9 and 10.
November 30 the Big Game will
be played in Berkeley, and Archi
bald will see that little fracas if he
has to swim across the bay, with a
short pause for sandwiches at
Treasure Island.
