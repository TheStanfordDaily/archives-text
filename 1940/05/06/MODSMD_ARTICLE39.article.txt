An intramural hardball meeting
will be held tonight at 8:30 o'clock
in Room 215 Encina, according to
Manager Andy Stojkovich to
straighten out all hardball loose
ends. Play so far has been ham
pered by rain and conflicts with
the swimming meet. All houses
that are interested in hardball
play must have at least one rep
resentative at the meeting.
It was also announced that because
of the lack of interest in the En
cina Softball League, there is a pos
sibility that all play will be stopped.
There will be a meeting tonight in
Room 215 Encina at 9 o'clock and if
there are enough interested Encina
men present, play will be continued.
If not, play will definitely be sus
pended.
