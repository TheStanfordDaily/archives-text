# Student Killed By Gun Wound
## 
### 
Edward L. Jennings, Farm junior
from Palo Alto, was found fatally
shot in his room at the Delta Chi
fraternity house Saturday night.
He died in the Palo Alto Hospital.
Although friends and fraternity
brothers said there was no apparent
suicide motive or explanatory note,
police believed Jennings shot him
self with a .22 caliber pistol found
by his side.
Fraternity members first learned
of the shooting after dinner when
they saw Jennings from the front
lawn, slumped in a chair before a
window of his room. His parents
were with him at his death.
