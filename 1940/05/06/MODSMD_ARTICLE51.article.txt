# '...I Fear No Evil'
## 
### 
FOR the first lime in this war, Great Britain is
really frightened. She failed in her attempt
to throw the Nazis out of Norway; Germany
says her air force has proved its potential men
ace as a naval weapon; and the people of
England have raised a cry of protest against a
government that brings them no news of vic
tory.
A flight of German bombers sank a 30,000-
ton British battleship, without the loss of a single
plane—or so the Nazis declare. Looking into
the future, they jubilantly announce the pro
posed destruction by bombs of the entire Brit
ish navy.
But they haven't sunk that navy yet. Nor
does it seem probable, considering that the war
continued for eight months before the Nazis
recorded a major air victory over any part of
the fleet, that German airplanes can ever sink
the British navy. When the submarine became
a real danger in the last war, efficient, defenses
against it were devised. It seems likely new
defenses will be devised to protect warships
from airplanes.
Great Britain is by no means bowing before
Nazi might. The Nazis are boasting while they
can, because it is necessary for dictators to
boast and to promise in order to stay alive.
The principal danger to the United States of
this fear of a British rout, based on the failure
of a half-baked Norwegian campaign and the
success of a few dive-bombers, is the growing
attitude, "Well, I suppose we'll have to help
them."
Americans must remember that is not the
point. Whether Great Britain is weak or strong,
there can be little danger to the United States
in a German victory in Europe. That Germany
could aspire to win this hemisphere in a cam
paign is beyond practicability. And if she were
to attempt Western domination through eco
nomic pressure, well, economic sanctions can
work both ways.
The strength of this country is in its de
mocracy and its tremendous wealth. We would
lose both if we traveled to Europe to help two
political factions demonstrate which is the
stronger.—J. B.
