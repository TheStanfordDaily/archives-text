STANFORD, beset by polls of one sort or
another, added another one to the list last
Friday when the Political Science Department's
Pi Sigma Alpha queried poli sci students as to
their Presidential preferences.
Students taking courses in the department—
including non-majors—favored the Democratic
party. Significantly enough, majors in the de
partment tended to favor Democratic candidates
far more strongly than non-majors.
In no way a scientific sampling, such as The
Daily's Gallup-style poll, Friday's balloting yet
showed a substantially different result from that
voiced by the University's traditional Republi
can majority. The only point upon which any
striking similarity can be noted is the fact that
students who have not had elementary courses
in poli sci favor Dewey overwhelmingly, giv
ing him as many votes as Hull, Roosevelt, and
Hoover combined. This compares positively
with The Daily poll.
Hull would be nominated by students who
voted, with Dewey ranking second and Roose
velt third.
Probably the most interesting evaluation of
the results would indicate this fact—that those
students who are, on the whole, more familiar
with (or at least exposed to) governmental and
political problems than the student body in gen
eral tend to favor the Democratic policies and
candidates.
If political tacticians can figure any moves
from these results, they're welcome to use
them.—D. H.
