## WELL. THE FOLIES IS COMING 
### 
r rilE EDITOR, SIR:
A lot has been said concerning Stanford House
Mothers but it seems to me that an important point
has been overlooked. Where are we to get suitable
house mothers for our erring fraternities?
Certainly unmarried women would not be suitable
as house mothers. They would be unable to under
stand and cope with the emotional problems of youth.
Therefore house mothers must he married women.
But a married woman with an active husband would
hiirdlv be able to split her attention between him and
some 30 or 40 adopted offspring.
This limits us to house mothers who are divorced
or widowed. You can imagine what worried parents
would say if they heard that Stanford was mothered
by 24 divorcees. The only alternative left is widows.

Where may I ask are you going to be able to find 21
middle-aged widows with the proper intellectual back
ground for understanding college youths, when Miss
Yo.Â«t is having trouble trying to keep nine sororities
supplied with house mothers.
Frankly worried.
Ram
