THREE CHEERS FOR THE IRISH
r |' , HE Irish are such fine people. They have never
harmed anyone but a few British imperialists,
and certainly they have never bombed Hollywood.
Why is it, then, that movie producers insist upon
persecuting the old Celts? Why is it that Hollywood is
forever making the same boring movie about the "hot
headed" Irish, with the same trite story and the same
•'homey" jokes? And above all, why do cinemakers
call the same picture by so many different names?
If you have the angelic patience to sit through
"Three Cheers for the Irish," you will be able to take
all the cues. You will meet so many age-weary lines
that you will surely recognize the truth of that old
maxim, "It's a small world after all." In fact, you
will be sure that the world is not only small, but also
positively stifling.
Take the little kitchen scene, for instance. (Irish
pictures always have a kitchen scene.) There is the
sentimental old Irish father, 25 years a cop. And
washing the dishes that he dries is Maureen, Cop
Casey's youngest daughter.
* * )it *
/ 'ASEY: Maureen darlin', your mother was a beau
tiful woman! Sure and I can still see her. (The
eyes are cast upwards with the suggestion of incipient
tears.) Your mother had light, chestnut hair, and eyes
as blue as the lakes of Kilarney.
Maureen (catching on ): She must have been beau
tiful.
Casey (with a sudden flash, as though the idea had
just occurred to him): Maureen darlin', when you
stand like that you're the picture of your mother!
Maureen (tenderly): Thanks, Dad.
(By this time Casey and Maureen have been pass
ing one plate back and forth—he dries it, and she
washes it again. It's such a refreshing little bit of
stage business.)
Casey (good-naturedly laughing as he catches him
self being sentimental): Well, we'll never get the
dishes done at this rate! (They both laugh in a fade
out.)
Ah, but touching drama is not the only attraction
in "Three Cheers for the Irish." We must have comic
relief. So Casey always slams the bathroom door so
hard that the picture on the wall falls to the floor.
This gives Casey a chance to demonsti'ate his hot Irish
temper. And finally the picture breaks. How's that
for a novel pay-off?
Then, of coui'se, there is family trouble. One
daughter goes out with a crooked gambler. And there
is lots of emotional strain over that, believe me. Hon
est Pat Casey won't have his daughter going out with
a cheap crook. And Maureen falls in love with a
young Scotsman, which Casey, to the anger of the
Scotsman, insists upon pronouncing "Scotchman."
But why tell more? Anyone can finish the story.
It is only too bad that no one can put a stop to the
story and finish it for good.
Why must there always be dramas about the Irish?
How about a new twist—"Three Cheers for the Lith
uanians"?
