# STANFORD—YESTERDAY, TODAY, AND TOMORROW
## 
### HARRY MALONEY Director of Minor Sports 
¥>EING an old Army man of considerable experience,
with a wartime background, I naturally obey
when the General commands. The General in this case
being the editor of The Stanford Daily, who asked me
to write a story touching upon the Stanford of Yes
terday, Today, and Tomorrow, for the Monday morn
ing issue of The Daily.
Here at the outset of this story I would like to quote
from an article the writer wrote for The Stanford
Alumnus, now the Stanford Illustrated Review, in the
January issue in 1915: "All of us who love Stanford
cherish a belief in the promise of Stanford for the
future, we hope that by the gradual contribution to
the world of class after class of graduates we may
help to raise the ideals of life—we think that Stanford
will stand for higher standards of honor, for clean
business, clean politics, greater efliciency, and greater
helpfulness to others in the better days to come."
When the above article was written Stanford was
quite young—Stanford is still young, not yet having
reached the Fiftieth Anniversary of the founding of
the University. What has Stanfoi'd been doing since
the above mentioned article was written some 25 years
ago? What has the generation of men and women,
who have gone to make up the Stanford family group,
been doing during the last quarter of a century toward
fulfilling what we term the Stanford promise?
* # * *
IF ONE were to go back over the records and study
the history of Stanford during this period of time,
one would realize that the Stanford student of today
measures up very well with the Stanford man of
yesterday, and that the generation of Stanford men
and women, during the last 25 years, has done much
toward keeping on a sound basis the first foundation
upon which the University was built. A glance through
the roster of who's-who in the business world, or the
many scientific fields of endeavor, will convince one
that Stanford continues to contribute to the world
young men and women of promise, young men and
women of Stanford's moulding, whose achievements
are well known throughout the world.
Of late years the Stanford student body has been
on the increase, and with this increase in number has
come a broader system of education; meaning that
Stanford has entered more fully the field of specializa
tion, to prepare the Stanford graduate of today to enter
the many professions which call for the specialist. This
specialization, however, in several scientific fields, has
brought to Stanford for advanced study many men and
women from other institutions, either as transfers or
graduates. The student body at the moment numbers
about 4,000, about 1.100 of whom are women—of this
total number, about 1400 are graduates, which cuts
down considerably the number of undergraduates.
Stanford in the past has been very proud of the
balanced type of student that has gone to make up
the personnel of the student body. When I speak of
balance. I have in mind the student who gives some
thought to the physical, as well as the mental side of
his make-up so that the two dovetail, so to speak.
Stanford too. has always been quite proud of the ath
letic achievements of the many athletic teams that
have represented Stanford, both in national and inter
national athletics. One would be safe in saving that
but few universities in the country today offer better
opportunities for recreation and play than are to lx>
found right here at Stanford. »_ ,

young men and women of promise, young men and
women of Stanford's moulding, whose achievements
are well known throughout the world.
Of late years the Stanford student body has been
on the increase, and with this increase in number has
come a broader system of education; meaning that
Stanford has entered more fully the field of specializa
tion, to prepare the Stanford graduate of today to enter
the many professions which call for the specialist. This
specialization, however, in several scientific fields, has
brought to Stanford for advanced study many men and
women from other institutions, either as transfers or
graduates. The student body at the moment numbers
about 4,000, about 1.100 of whom are women—of this
total number, about 1400 are graduates, which cuts
down considerably the number of undergraduates.
Stanford in the past has been very proud of the
balanced type of student that has gone to make up
the personnel of the student body. When I speak of
balance. I have in mind the student who gives some
thought to the physical, as well as the mental side of
his make-up so that the two dovetail, so to speak.
Stanford too. has always been quite proud of the ath
letic achievements of the many athletic teams that
have represented Stanford, both in national and inter
national athletics. One would be safe in saving that
but few universities in the country today offer better
opportunities for recreation and play than are to lx>

when the General commands. The General in this case
being the editor of The Stanford Daily, who asked me
to write a story touching upon the Stanford of Yes
terday, Today, and Tomorrow, for the Monday morn
ing issue of The Daily.
Here at the outset of this story I would like to quote
from an article the writer wrote for The Stanford
Alumnus, now the Stanford Illustrated Review, in the
January issue in 1915: "All of us who love Stanford
cherish a belief in the promise of Stanford for the
future, we hope that by the gradual contribution to
the world of class after class of graduates we may
help to raise the ideals of life—we think that Stanford
will stand for higher standards of honor, for clean
business, clean politics, greater efliciency, and greater
helpfulness to others in the better days to come."
When the above article was written Stanford was
quite young—Stanford is still young, not yet having
reached the Fiftieth Anniversary of the founding of
the University. What has Stanfoi'd been doing since
the above mentioned article was written some 25 years
ago? What has the generation of men and women,
who have gone to make up the Stanford family group,
been doing during the last quarter of a century toward
fulfilling what we term the Stanford promise?
* # * *
IF ONE were to go back over the records and study
the history of Stanford during this period of time,
one would realize that the Stanford student of today
measures up very well with the Stanford man of
yesterday, and that the generation of Stanford men
and women, during the last 25 years, has done much
toward keeping on a sound basis the first foundation
upon which the University was built. A glance through
the roster of who's-who in the business world, or the
many scientific fields of endeavor, will convince one
that Stanford continues to contribute to the world
young men and women of promise, young men and
women of Stanford's moulding, whose achievements
are well known throughout the world.
