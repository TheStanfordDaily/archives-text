# Durbin Film Is Grade 'A' Flicker Fare
## 
### 
"It's a Date," now showing at the
Stanford Theater.
Deanna Durbin hasn't been in a
bad picture since her debut in
"Three Smart Girls," and her latest
effort, "It's a Date," keeps up the
fine standard set in her other pic
tures. Aided by a good supporting
cast headed by Kay Francis and
Walter Pidgeon, and with production
in charge of Louis Pasternak, the
film is Grade "A" from the start to
the closing fade-out.
The .story is a variation on the
eternal triangle theme, with Deanna
and Miss Francis, as mother and
daughter, competing for the h;tnd of
Walter Pidgeon and the lead role in
a Broadway musical show. The last
scene finds Deanna a success in her
stage debut as Kay Francis and
Walter Pidgeon watch with pater
nal pride.
DEANNA SWINGS
Best musical numbers of the show
were Miss Durbin's renditions of
"Ave Maria" and "Loch Lomond."
A rhythmical contrast is offered in
the latter scenes, with the action laid
in Honolulu, by Harry Owens and
his Royal Hawaiians.
Universal Studios deserves credit
for transforming Miss Durbin from
a child prodigy to a first-rate ac
tress, and actually capitalizing on
the adolescent period. In "It's a
Date" the young star turns in the
best acting performance of her ca
reer.
WALTER PIDGEON PRAISED
Walter Pidgeon is rapidly out
growing his "most-underrated-ac
tor" title. He doesn't steal any
scenes, but he handles a rather diffi
cult role very well. Kay Francis
suffers in contrast with the more
youthful Deanna, and deserves bet
ter parts.
The photography is especially good
without being spectacular. Camera
man Valentine, one of Hollywood's
top celluloid artists, makes excel
lent use of lighting, without resort
ing to trick shots.
"Adventure in Diamonds," co
starring Lsa Miranda and George
Brent, is the second feature. A rath
er involved tale of diamond thieves
in South Africa, the film inoffensive
ly runs its course without disturb
ing anyone's sleep.â€”Brucker
