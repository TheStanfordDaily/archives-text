# Twenty Rescued From Shipwreck
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, May 5 (UP).â€”
The wrecked steamer Daisy Math
ews, swept helplessly for 20 miles
in heavy seas, jammed aground on
the rocky Northern California
coast north of Eureka today shortly
after the Coast Guard cutter Ariadne
safely removed the crew of 20 which
had remained aboard the wallowing
I craft more than 24 hours.
