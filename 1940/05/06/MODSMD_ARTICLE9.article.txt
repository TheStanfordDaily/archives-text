# Cards Head For Revenge Over U.S.C.
## Indian Track Team Points to Fresno After L.A. Defeat 
### 
Heroes in spite of their defeat
at the hands of U.S.C. by the nar
row margin of 71J/| to 59-/ i, the
Stanford track team returned to
the Farm yesterday heavy favor
ites to take the Trojans in their
next encounter at Fresno this Sat
urday.
Bowing to the superior weight of
reserves, and an abundance of Tro
jan "come-through" men, the In
dians were still hoping, until Troy's
clean sweep in the low hurdles put
U.S.C. clearly in the winner's
bracket.
With memories of the double wins
by Captain Clyde Jeffrey, big Stan
Andersen, and Paul Moore, the Car
dinals are looking forward to three
more meetings with the men from
Troy. The Fresno Relays this week
end will be followed by the Pacific
Coast Conference meet at Los An
geles May 25, and the N.C.A.A. meet
at Evanston, 111., in June.
TROY SWEEPS HURDLES
Hard luck put Frank Guthrie and
Dick Simpson out of the high hur
dles, giving the Trojans a clean
sweep. When the lows came around,
Sid Hayes' absence helped them re
peat their victory to sew up the
meet.
But Coach Bill Ellington's squad
came through with enough out
standing performances to make the
trip south worth anyone's time. Paul
Moore became king Of Coast distance
men when he won the mile in
4:11.5 for a new meet record. He
came back to win the two-mile, out
classing the highly touted Louie
Zamperini and Leroy Weed in both
races.
ANDERSEN SETS RECORD
Andersen heaved his best toss in
the shot, 55 feet 3% inches, for a new
meet record, and followed this with
first place in the discus at 155 feet 8
inches, another of his best marks.
Andersen is now a real threat to
Elmer Hackney of Kansas when they
meet this summer.
If Clyde Jeffrey ever failed to
come through with his double win,
the Indians might think the end of
the world was coming. As it was
"Jeff" won by big margins in both
dashes, then anchored the relay
team to a third win.
But the "Big Three" were not the
only heroes of Saturday's meet. Bob
Kenyon, whose best vault was 13-6,
pushed himself over the 14 - foot
mark—but it was a practice try. His
13-9 gave him a tie for second.
Charlie Shaw upset the great How
ard Upton of U.S.C. in a 47.7 quar
ter, while Ray Brown's 24 feet 1 inch
leap in the broad jump gave Stan-
