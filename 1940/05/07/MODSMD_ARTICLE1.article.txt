# History ...1940
## 
### WILSON CANNON 
| N DAYS gone by, wars were
fought on a single battlefront.
There was none of this multiplicity
if war areas, with three or four ter
ser nations nipping at the hocks of
ach major belligerent.
Not so in 1940. Europe is dotted
vith battlefields, prospective fighting
grounds, and areas that the local
WPA is clearing just in case a war
ihould come their way.
Another thing about the wars our
•rehears used to fight. Great
•anddaddy would pick up his lance,
randmammy would hook his tin
rmor together, and off he would go
i find someone to combat.
It was all man-to-man in those
ays.
Germany, under the banner of
\dolf Hitler, ler, is surging across
the continent in the latest of its
campaigns to prove the world su
>eriority of the Teutonic peoples,
r hcir war is one to bring German
civilization to the nations of Eu
rope which they consider back
ward.
Across 500-odd miles of sea from
tie borders of the Reich is England.
Another country very much con
scious of the value of its own cul
ture. Differing from Germany be
cause the English "mode of living"
has already been accepted.

I WANGLING on the outskirts of
World War II are the spaghetti
like arms of the Italian octopus. An
>ther nation which cannot forget the
glorious past. Days when the
Roman legions carried the gospel of
taly throughout Europe may be
epeated ... if Signor Mussolini's
Iream will come true.
The huge Soviet nation, at present
jccupying the part of the maliciously
lisinterested bystander, has its own
code of conduct. The Russian way.
And should the opportunity show it
self, the "Russian way" might be
come the way of civilization.
Across miles of tossing ocean, toss
the race conscious people of a na
tion just beginning to assert itself
is a world power. Japan, where a
nilitary cast has no international in
ubitions, believes that the cultural
ime-table is about to swing back
> the Orient.
Five nations and five peoples.
Each of whom sees the self-same
mission before it. A mission of
carrying the "only" culture to the
remainder of the world.
Two of them, England and Ger
nany, are now at war. The other
ree are perched vulture-like
round the arena ready to join in as
oon as one of the fighters is de
feat ed.

the third major nation
now engaged in World War 11,
s something of a paradox. The
French people tire not so repellantly
•onscious of their own virtues. They
vill admit that other races may have
heir good points.
And so it is that, we of neutral
America do not read so very much
ibout. France in this latest world
wide conflict. French . . . Brit
ish, both allied in war. But to a
usual reader it would seem that
Britain is fighting alone.
The collective memory of the
French nation is good. But it is
not good enough to stretch back to
the Napoleonic era, when the
Eagles of the Emperor stretched
across most of the civilized world.
They think mostly of times less
distant in the past. They fight the
Reich because they cannot forget
the many times Germany has de
feated them.
The three nations who are stand
ing by apparently sense the end of
one of the two fighters in the arena.
The tone of the Italian press during
the past few days has been defi
•litely anti-British. And Italy will
lot move until they know they are
ight.
Russia recently rebuffed English
idvances of friendship. They de
fined to participate in a trade
igrcemont which would have meant
lie severing of relations with the
Jeich.
Japan is still standing by.
