# Lud Gluskin's Band Will Play At Annual Senior Ball, June 14
## 
### 
Because the Class of 'Ml does not want to swing at its Senior Ball, the
smooth, sophisticated music of Lud Gluskin and his 20-piecc Columbia
Broadcasting orchestra with Martha Tilton, popular vocalist, will be fea
tured at the annual affair on June 14.
Benny Goodman, originally under consideration by the Senior Ball

committee, was not signed because
tremendous number of class mem
bers complained that they wanted
their last Stanford dance to be "ro
mantic and sentimental," according
to Rudy Munzer and Annabelle
Clark, co-chairmen.
KYSER NOT AVAILABLE
Kay Kyser's band will not be
available on the evening of the ball
because he is gummed up by a con
tract with W. K. Wrigley to play at
Catalina Island. The ball will start
at 11 o'clock, and the music will
continue until 4 o'clock in the morn
ing.
Price of the bids has been set at
$8.50, which is as low as any Senior
Ball has been and $2 less than it was
several years ago, according to Dick
Simpson, in charge of ticket sales.
This includes souvenir gifts for the
ladies, specially designed white
leather dance programs, and an
elaborate breakfast served after the
ball.
SOUVENIRS SELECTED
Selected by George Dole and Jean
Bolton, the souvenirs will be ster
ling silver identification bracelets.
Silver link charm models, they will
have round identification tags hang
ing from them with "Stanford—Sen
ior Ball—June 14, 1940," engraved
on one side and the other side re
served for the name of the wearer.
The location of the dance has not
yet been decided, but it probably
will be announced following a
meeting of the ball committee next
Thursday night. A change from the
usual Toyon Lobby spot is being se
riously considered.
The beautiful songstress, Martha
Tilton, is well known for the many
recordings she has made with Benny
Goodman's band.
