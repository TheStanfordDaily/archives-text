# Couples Begin 'Check' Drive For Home Fund
## Solicitations Start Last Night Following Canvassers' Banquet 
### 
Armed with blank checks for $2.56,
payable to the A.S.S.U. Convalescent
Home, 4:5 couples began the tenth
annual off-campus drive last night.
The checks, bearing the motto,
"Give a Day of Happiness," repre
sent the amount that will keep a
child in the Home for 24 hours.
Under the direction of Sue Hyman
and Graham Barbey, each couple
will cover an assigned territory in
the systematic* canvassing of Palo
Alto residents. The Drive will last
through Thursday.
SOLICITORS START
Solicitations got under way last
night when solicitors met at the
Convalescent Home, and were taken
on a tour of the buildings and
grounds by; Mrs. Ruth Atwood, di
rector.
The annual Drive banquet was held
at 6 o'clock at the Palo Alto Com
munity Center, after which canvass
ers left for their first evening of
calls.
SALES METHODS TOLD
Paul Davis, director of the Stan
ford Associates, spoke at the banquet
to explain the methods of the Drive,
and to give advice on salesmanship.
John Lawry and Miss Hyman dem
onstrated the technique with a skit.
The three couples who bring in
the largest amount in contributions
will be rewarded.
This year the ofT-campus drive
will attempt to beat last year's all
time record of $1,330 in contribu
tions, according to Barbey.
