# Nazi Planes Sink Three Destroyers
## English, Poles, French Lose One Ship Each Off Norwegian Coast 
### 
LONDON, May 6 (UP). —The
Allies admitted today in official
communiques that Na/.i bombing
planes have sunk three more de
stroyers off the Norwegian coast
where Germany's air superiority
has driven the British and French
expeditionary forces to a new bat
tlefront above the Arctic Circle.
Three trawlers — the Penn, the
Hercules and the Lenora, each with
a crew of nine—also were given up
for lost.
One British, one French, and a
Polish destroyer attached to the
British naval forces were sunk by
the Nazi bombers, it was stated in
communiques issued here and in
Paris.
They were:
1. The 1,870-ton British flotilla
leader Afridi, one of Britain's
newest and biggest destroyers,
which was sunk by bombs while
protecting Allied troop withdraw
als from the central Norwegian
port of Namsos, probably last
Thursday.
2. The 2.436-ton French destroy
er Bison, sunk last Friday in the
upper North Sea off the Norwe
gian coast while convoying Allied
troopships—the first French war
ship sunk by enemy fire since the
outbreak of the Avar eight months
ago.
3. The 2,144-ton Polish destroyer
Groin, sunk by bombs off Norway
with a loss of about 66 men.
ALLIED SOLDIERS HOME
Weary British and French soldiers
arrived at a northern British port
today from Norway and were told, in
a message from War Minister Oliver
Stanley, that "under proper condi
tions" they would have been a
match for the German invaders.
"Don't think you were driven out
of Norway . . . you were ordered
eat " said General Sir Edmund
Ironside, chief of the Imperial gen
eral staff, who was on hand to greet
the troops and read Stanley's mes
sage.
The British and French troops, ac
companied by their officers, stood
silently after the reading of the
war minister's message but they
cheered when Ironside added his
"little thanks."
CHURCHILL MAY TELL ALL'
First Lord of the Admiralty Win
ston Churchill may reveal tomorrow
the "inside story" of the Allied with
drawal from Norway, if he feels he
is being made a target of unfair at
tack during wide-open debate in
the House of Commons.
The fighting First Lord of the Ad
miralty was reported to have
threatened to "tell all" because of a
whispering campaign attaching to
him much of the blame for the Nor
wegian fiasco.
Churchill was represented to be
prepared to state publicly that he
favored a strong naval attack on
Trondheim, hub of the German con
quest of central and southern Nor
way, but that he was over-ruled by
higher- authorities in the govern
ment.
