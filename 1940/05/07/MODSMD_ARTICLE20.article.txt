# Beans Donated By King City Area Growers
## 
### JERRY MAYER 
The Quad, traditional center of
activity on the Farm, will take a
back seat today as Stanford con
verges upon Union Court from 10 to
5 o'clock to lie on the grass and
absorb the sun, music, entertain
ment, and strawberry shortcake.
It's the Strawberry Brunch, al
ways one of the gayest features of
the annual Convalescent Home
Drive. Engineered this year by Co
chairmen Ruthelen List and George
Concannon, the Brunch will offer
two hours of Stanford's finest home
brewed talent and two hours of
music by Bob Saunders and his
Sweet's Ballroom music.
THE FARM EATS BEANS
Concurrently with the Brunch is
Bean Day, under the leadership of
Chairman Pete Whittlesey.
All campus living groups will eat
beans for their luncheon meals, the
cost of a usual meal to be devoted to
the Convalescent Home cause.
"We have fifty pounds of the King
City's finest pink beans on hand
for Bean Day and they will be dis
tributed to the various living
groups," said Whittlesey. "These
beans were generously donated to us
by growers in King City especially
for the Convalescent Home cause."
COFFEE, SHORTCAKE
At the Brunch, 58 beauteous Ro
ble maidens will serve coffee and
shortcake for 25 cents a portion.
From 1 to 3 o'clock, Stanfordites will
tap their toes to Saunders' rhythm,
while the affair will close with two
hours of local talent entertainment
from 3 to 5 o'clock.
Aubrey Austin, Gaieties and Spring
Show comedian, will be master of
ceremonies of the informal show,
which will feature vocalists Norma
McKenzie and Yvonne Hazlett of
fering indidivual renditions of Ha
waiian and popular songs. Mary
Jeans Haynes will play the piano,
and Peggy Helms will present her
Hawaiian program, replete with
songs and orchestra.
Yogi Jack G rover, who claims he
has a whole new bagfull of mystify
ing tricks, will do a popular "re
peat" of his last year's appearance
during the Convalescent. Home
Drive.
QUARTET WILL SING
The "Quinntones," will also en
tertain. The "Quinntones" are com
posed of Bill Quinn, their leader, and
Jack Shaw, George Schramm, and
Elena Bruton.
In the spirit of the gala festivities
of the Strawberry Brunch, the cam
pus will be decorated in a manner
calculated to arouse the campus' ap
petite for strawberries. The fountain
in front of the Main Labe will be
filled with red balloons which will
be guarded by two cardboard figures
wearing aprons and holding trays.
Arrows will be placed around the
campus pointing toward the Union
Court., while posters and large paper
strawberries will be placed at vari
ous points.
Two Robleites will vend cigarettes
at the Brunch. Candy bars will also
be on sale.
