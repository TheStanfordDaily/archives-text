### FRANK GUTHRIE 
Injuries and inexperience com
bined to defeat the Stanford? in the
Coliseum Saturday. For once in a
long while the Cards weren't baffled
by the preponderance of stars on the
Trojan track team, because man for
man the Indians had El Troje licked
from the start.
Ilut injuries, which are liable to
he the hex of any team, started
Stanford's defeat two weeks ago,
and then inexperience finished
tin in, so that the Trojans could
cr.me through and win on their
huge number of places and shows.
Il Bill Ellington had known that
Sid Hayes' first in the high hurdles
against Cal wasn't necessary for the
Big Meet victory, his question-mark
hurdler could have taken that nec
essary first in the barriers Saturday
and Dick Simpson, knowing that the
hurdle load wasn't on his shoulders
alone, undoubtedly would have
pressed Hayes the same as he did
against the Bears.

THE CASE of Mush Girard is a
hard one to figure out, but it might
have been this way: Paul Moore wins
both mile and two-mile as he did
Saturday, but Mush runs the half
mile where he is capable of running
under 1:53.
But as for inexperience, you can
figure that no less than four points
were donated to the Trojans.
Blair Hyde and Ken Battaglia are
better than country half-milcrs
and sprinters but they just tied up
in their first big meet of the year.
There's a lot of difference between
junior college running and college,
and Paul Moore more than anyone
else realizes that. Last year he could
run a fair race around the track,
but didn't know a thing about pac
ing. He was no better than 1:57 in
the half then.
When Moore was purposely left
out of the 880 to concentrate on
the two mile, Blair wasn't able to
judge either the first 440 or the
third 220 and as a result, Art
Reading, a veteran campaigner,
ran off with the race. Both Hyde
and Clark had run a full two sec
onds better than Reading's time
Saturday just three days beforeâ€”
hut Moore was in there setting the
pace when they did it.
So just watch Hyde next year
when he gets that pacing problem
figured out.
Battaglia in practice and in the
Big Meet showed the fans that he
can just about touch Captain
Jeff's shirt tails, hut he was so j
worried Saturday morning, and
with little sleep Friday night, he j
wasn't in any shape to keep up
with Barney Willis and Mickey
Anderson.
But he'll be okay from now on in j
with more races in big-time compe
tition under his belt. He's the one
who Stanford will count on to fill
part of Jeff's shoes next spring.

LOUIE ZAMPERINI was defeated
in two different types of races by |
Moore, and the latter now firmly be- j
lieves that he has Louie's number J
and that he'll take him every time i
thev meet from now on in.

[ In the mile Paul foxed Zam
perini by sprinting the last lap in
G1 seconds, and Louie, who tried
to keep up with him instead of
laying' hack and then kicking his
way to victory, stayed on his tail.
As a result lie didn't have enough
to heat Paul.
Then in the two-mile, Paul, Louie,
and Leroy Weed purposely put on
: a slow first seven and a hall laps.
Moore dropping back on the back
stretch to watch his opponents. Then
when Louise started his kick going
oft' the last curve, Paul cut loose,
and that victory smile which played
on Zamp's face, didn't last very long
; as Paul out-sprinted his rival to the
| tape.
After the meet, Louie told a
Trojan firend of mine that Paul
would never heat him again this
year, hut that is a matter of con
jecture as he will find that Moore
is improving with every week. Be
sides, Moore has all the confidence
in the world that he can take
Zamp's measure in any race from
the 880 up.
In fact, Paul hopes that in the
medley relay (which will be one of
the highlight events in the Fresno
Relays this week-end) he is pre
sented with a 10-yard deficit in back
of Zamp in the final mile. But the
chances are they'll get ofl to an even
start if Cromwell puts Upton. Read
ing, and Weed in ahead of Zamp,
and if Ellington has Shaw, Hyde,
and Girard running before Paul.

AFTER ZAMP'S DEFEAT in the
two-mile, Ernie Clark went up to
him, congratulating him on his fine
work.
"Nice work, Louie, plenty nice,"
he is supposed to have said.
"Why, thanks," Louie said,
pleased that a Stanford man had
recognized his fine race.
"Yeah, nice work, but as you told
Ed Burrows (of Stanford two years
ago) I always say that I want to see
the best man win," Clark added.
Burorws had been run into the
ground by Zamp on the same sys
tem that Paul used on Zamp Sat
urday.

COACH DEAN CROMWELL may
have the respect of his own athletes,
but he doesn't have Clyde Jeffrey's
anymore.
Jeff held out his hand to shake
hands with the Dean just before
the meet, but Cromwell put both
hands over his head saying, "I
give up; I give up," and then
walked away.
And so Jeff proceeded to make
Cromwell like it for the second
straight year by capturing his daily
double and in both instances made
the Dean's pampered sprinters look
as if they might be winners in a
slower league.
