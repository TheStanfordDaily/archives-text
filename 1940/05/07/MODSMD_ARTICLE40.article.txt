# Track Squad Works Out For Fresno
## 
### CHUCK SMITH 
With their hiss to U.S.C. thrust
out of their mind like a had dream,
Stanford's trackmen assumed in a
husiucss-like manner their prtpa
ration for this coming Saturday's
Fresno Relays.
Mush Girard indicated that the 1
alight recurrence of the muscle '
cramp that has been bothering him !
and which forced him to withdraw ;
rom the mile last week-end down j
South was not at all serious. He :
loped oft a 1:54.5 half-mile yester
day afternoon, putting plenty of
pressure on the bad leg, with no ill
effects, in the best race he has run
since he was hurt.
SIMPSON RECOVERS
Dick Simpson was perfectly all j
right after his bad fall against the j
1 rojans. Last night he worked out 1
hard with an eye to showing U.S.C.'s
hurdlers, when he meets them again
down at Fresno, how badly he would
have beaten them if he hadn't hit
that barrier.
I?ob Kenyon, who cleared 14
feet on a practice try Saturday,
was flirting with this height in
yesterday's workout.
Coach Bill Ellington began con
sidering his relay teams yesterday, j
With an abundance of talent in both I
the sprints and middle distances, it's |
going to be hard to choose the best
four men.
RELAY TEAM SET
For instance, the sprint relays in- '
elude the four-man 440- and 880- ;
yard events. Ellington has Captain
Clyde Jeffrey, Les Johnson, Ken
Battaglia, Don McFarland or John
Grant to choose from in the shorter j
race. In the longer event Charlie I
Shaw will enter into the picture I
some place.
The mile relay team is virtually
set, and ought to be in good shape
for lowering their own world's
record. In the distances there will
be Burman Skrable, Blair Hyde,
Ernie Clark, Jack Moore. Mush
Girard. and Paul Moore to choose
frcm for the two-mile relay.
