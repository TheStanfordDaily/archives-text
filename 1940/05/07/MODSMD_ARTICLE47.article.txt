SEVERAL pleas have been made of late ask
ing that the Administration search every
available source of additional revenue before
they raise the tuition, fees.
Surprisingly enough, not one of the sugges
tions offered has made any hint of a possibility
of letting the good professors go to better-paid
jobs. Nor has any one of them denied that the
condition of Stanford's buildings and grounds
is deplorable indeed. In other words, the aver
age undergraduate wants to keep the same pro
fessors and wants modern classrooms and mod
ern roads; he just doesn't want the burden to
fall on himself.
This inclination toward self-interest is natural
enough. And one can hardly blame students
for reacting unfavorably to a move that may
mean transferring to Cal for some of them. But
while a few students might be penalized that
drastically by a tuition raise, the welfare of the
entire University depends upon keeping a sol
vent Stanford treasury.
The Farm represents an investment of over
thirty million dollars. But Stanford represents
more than that. It stands for a deserved high
rating in the society of American universities.
We have, then, not only a thirty million, dollar
investment to protect, but the Stanford name
and Stanford educational standards to maintain
as well.
In all fairness to both the worried student and
an equally worried Administration, it must be
pointed out that both sides have been working
overtime to prevent the possibility of a raise.
The student and alumni opposition has sug
gested everything from an automobile-on-cam
pus tax to the sale of University properties and
stocks. The Administration has fought off the
possibility of a raise for more months than the
very recent publicity of their fears would indi
cate. As far back as September, 1938, Acting
Comptroller J. Hugh lackson in his Report to
the President commented upon the fact that
normal maintenance of buildings and grounds
was being hampered by a general decline of
interest rates and other factors.
Someone is bound to suffer in the end. We
can only hope that the least painful solution of
several alternates will be presented to the
student bodv.
