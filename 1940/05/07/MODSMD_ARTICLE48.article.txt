# King City Pinks
## 
### 
AT noon today you, the Stanford student
body, will have laid before you 900 pounds
of King City beans which have been furnished
by the growers of that region. It is through
their kind and generous co-operation that the
Farm is able to add about $500 each year to the
Convalescent Home Drive.
How many of you will stop to think of the
principle behind the pink beans so generously
donated by the King City bean growers? Think
of what Bean Day stands for?
Most of us have not had the opportunity to
find out. To the majority, it is as it was last year
and the year before and the year before that.
But how did it start? Who started it? What is
behind it? What does it all add up to? What
does it mean?
It all goes back about eight years when the
Farm had a real fight to literally dig up its share
of the Convalescent Home Fund, and when the
Home s services were even more valuable.
Since that time, eight years in a row, near
the first of May, the campus sits down to a meal
composed of beansâ€”bean soup for an appe
tizer, baked beans for the entree, and bean
salad for variety. It has become one of the
traditions, one of the things that is told and dis
cussed when classmates gather in front of a fire
or over a dinner table. It is not a tradition out
moded by conditions but rather it is
one which will be a living tradition as long as
there is a Convalescent Home Drive.
It is a tradition which has a background of
need and usefulness. So this noon when we
sit down at the luncheon table let us keep in
mind why we are eating beans and what it
means to those who are less fortunate than us,
yet would be like us. G. H.
