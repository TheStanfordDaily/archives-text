TO HAVE, AND HAVE NOT

EDITOR, SIR:
If the reports of University administrators'speech
es are accurate, it would seem that Stanford must take
some immediate steps to solve the problem of her in
sufficient yearly revenue.
The students of this University realize that the fac
ulty, in submitting to a depression wage cut, did not
expect to remain on a partial pay basis permanently.
We are certainly in hearty approval of the restoration
of full annual stipends, particularly in view of the ris
ing prices of the past few years.
Wages are, however, only a part of the University's
budget problem. For example, there is that of main
tenance and patrolling of the private roads about the
campus. Though all students benefit from the roads,
that benefit Ls disproportionate when we differentiate
between car operators and non-operators.
All are familiar with the gas tax system for the
maintenance of state roads. Why shouldn't Stanford
adopt that same principle? In this time of pressing
need for funds, why not a campus tax for each motor
vehicle operated here by a student?
Certainly those who are fortunate enough to pos
sess cars and maintain them should be able to bear the
burden of additional cost better than the student who
must walk or pedal a bicycle.
