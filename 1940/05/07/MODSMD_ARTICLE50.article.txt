### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
. . . EVIL OLD MAN
so many people and Stanford University badly
in need of financial support, it is a little sad to
see economic waste blooming on bill boards. And
those "Garner for Pi - esident" signs are sheer economic
waste, money poured down the drain. Garner has as
much chance of being elected President of the United
States as Paul Robeson has of becoming Exalted Wiz
ard of the Ku Klux Klan.
In eight years our poker-playing Vice-President
hasn't done a single significant constructive thing. His
name has appeared in the newspapers for only two
reasons: First, because he has vainly tried to pit his
puny mind against the Administration by helping the
New Deal's enemies to back-bite. And second, Jack
Garner has commemorated things, opened the Senate's
sessions, played poker, and kissed babies. An en
viable record.

Cactus Jack docs have one qualification for a
successful politician; he usually refuses to take
sides. Whenever a controversial issue is being debated,
Jack plays poker.
A mass-meeting was recently held in Southern Cali
fornia, the proper locale for a bonanza of mass-meet
ings. And in true democratic fashion all presidential
primary delegations were represented, even the dele
gation for John Nance Garner.
An old line Texas Democrat spoke for Texas' un
favored son, and managed to muster some meaningless
phrases in favor of his candidate. But someone in the
audience had a practical turn of mind.
"How does Mr. Garner stand on the embargo ques
tion," the gentleman asked.
"Well," Mr. Garner's speaker faltered, "our Vice-
President is above all, ladies and gentlemen, a South
ern gentleman. And as a Southern gentleman sitting
in the President's cabinet, it would be unfitting for
Mr. Garner to take any stand afr all."
The latter statement has a kernel of truth in it, in
view of Mr. Gamer's capabilities. But what is Marga
ret Mitchell commg to when Mr Garner turns out to
be a Southern gentleman?
It's a good thing Garner has no chance of being
elected. If he were, there would be another Civil War.
Illinois would secede from the Union.

. . . EVIL OLD MAN
so many people and Stanford University badly
in need of financial support, it is a little sad to
see economic waste blooming on bill boards. And
those "Garner for Pi - esident" signs are sheer economic
waste, money poured down the drain. Garner has as
much chance of being elected President of the United
States as Paul Robeson has of becoming Exalted Wiz
ard of the Ku Klux Klan.
In eight years our poker-playing Vice-President
hasn't done a single significant constructive thing. His
name has appeared in the newspapers for only two
reasons: First, because he has vainly tried to pit his
puny mind against the Administration by helping the
New Deal's enemies to back-bite. And second, Jack
Garner has commemorated things, opened the Senate's
sessions, played poker, and kissed babies. An en
viable record.

Cactus Jack docs have one qualification for a
successful politician; he usually refuses to take
sides. Whenever a controversial issue is being debated,
Jack plays poker.
A mass-meeting was recently held in Southern Cali
fornia, the proper locale for a bonanza of mass-meet
ings. And in true democratic fashion all presidential
primary delegations were represented, even the dele
gation for John Nance Garner.
An old line Texas Democrat spoke for Texas' un
favored son, and managed to muster some meaningless
phrases in favor of his candidate. But someone in the
audience had a practical turn of mind.
"How does Mr. Garner stand on the embargo ques
tion," the gentleman asked.
"Well," Mr. Garner's speaker faltered, "our Vice-
President is above all, ladies and gentlemen, a South
ern gentleman. And as a Southern gentleman sitting
in the President's cabinet, it would be unfitting for
Mr. Garner to take any stand afr all."
The latter statement has a kernel of truth in it, in
view of Mr. Gamer's capabilities. But what is Marga
ret Mitchell commg to when Mr Garner turns out to
be a Southern gentleman?
It's a good thing Garner has no chance of being
elected. If he were, there would be another Civil War.
Illinois would secede from the Union.
