### HARRY MALONEY Director of Minor Sports 
(Continued from yesterday's issue)

IT has been the boast of Stanford, when speaking of
athletics or organized play, that the majority of
Stanford students are not only "of the game" but "in
the game." This is just as it should be, for sane, whole
some, competitive athletics not only betters a student
physically, but teaches him many things that will prove
valuable in later life—self-confidenee, self-control, self
,discipline, self-reliance, the ability to concentrate and
to plan one's own campaign, to execute one's own
plans, and to keep alive and healthy one's ideals.
Although the student body enrollment at this time
is as high as at any time in Stanford's history, we
cannot lose sight of the fact that when we take into
account the number of transfers, gradaute students and
women students, and students taking military training,
we find that the students available to fill the ranks of
our major and minor athletic teams are considerably
diminished. There are probably not at any one time
more than six to seven hundred students available to
fill the ranks of all our major and minor sport teams,
or to cax*ry out our intercollegiate programs.
This means that when possible, "in athletics at
least," specialization should be avoided, otherwise there
is not sufficient athletic material of varsity caliber to
go around. It would be to the advantage of our major
sport teams, were our coaches to encourage, or prac
tice a kind of athletic reciprocity, which would assist
in keeping our major sport teams balanced.

THREE, or even a two major sport athlete at
Stanford is getting to be a rarity; such was not
true some few years ago when the three-star athlete,
meaning a student who had earned his block "S" in
three sports, was much in evidenec on the Quad. In
fact, when crew was a major sport at Stanford, a four
star athlete was not a rarity.
The writer ventures to predict that a new epoch in
major intercollegiate athletics at Stanford will be
launched next fall. Our track and field team under the
able guidance of Coach Bill Ellington has started us
upward again on the athletic ladder of fame. Football
and other branches of major sports will follow suit
when the Univeristy goes into session to commence
the academic year 1940-41, This will be most fitting, for
next year our alumni will be visiting their Alma Mater
in large numbers in commemoration of the Fiftieth
Anniversary of the birth of Stanford University. Dur
ing their wanderings on the campus, the alumni of
yesterday and today will have an opportunity of be
coming closely acquainted with the alumni of to
morrow.
A thought at the moment comes to the writer's mind
—will the alumni of "tomorrow" come up to expecta
tions and stand up under the close scrutiny of the
alumni of "today." The answer is yes, for the Stanford
undergraduate of today is in many instances the off
spring of the Stanford man of yesterday, a "chip off
the old block." one might say. They arc students whose
father or mother before them passed through the
portals of Stanford: they, too, had measured tip to the
generation of Stanford men and women who had pre
ceded them, a kind of connecting link between the Stan
ford of yesterday, today, and tomorrow.

plans, and to keep alive and healthy one's ideals.
Although the student body enrollment at this time
is as high as at any time in Stanford's history, we
cannot lose sight of the fact that when we take into
account the number of transfers, gradaute students and
women students, and students taking military training,
we find that the students available to fill the ranks of
our major and minor athletic teams are considerably
diminished. There are probably not at any one time
more than six to seven hundred students available to
fill the ranks of all our major and minor sport teams,
or to cax*ry out our intercollegiate programs.
This means that when possible, "in athletics at
least," specialization should be avoided, otherwise there
is not sufficient athletic material of varsity caliber to
go around. It would be to the advantage of our major
sport teams, were our coaches to encourage, or prac
tice a kind of athletic reciprocity, which would assist
in keeping our major sport teams balanced.

THREE, or even a two major sport athlete at
Stanford is getting to be a rarity; such was not
true some few years ago when the three-star athlete,
meaning a student who had earned his block "S" in
three sports, was much in evidenec on the Quad. In
fact, when crew was a major sport at Stanford, a four
star athlete was not a rarity.
The writer ventures to predict that a new epoch in
major intercollegiate athletics at Stanford will be
launched next fall. Our track and field team under the
able guidance of Coach Bill Ellington has started us
upward again on the athletic ladder of fame. Football
and other branches of major sports will follow suit
when the Univeristy goes into session to commence
the academic year 1940-41, This will be most fitting, for
next year our alumni will be visiting their Alma Mater
in large numbers in commemoration of the Fiftieth
Anniversary of the birth of Stanford University. Dur
ing their wanderings on the campus, the alumni of
yesterday and today will have an opportunity of be
coming closely acquainted with the alumni of to
morrow.
A thought at the moment comes to the writer's mind
—will the alumni of "tomorrow" come up to expecta
tions and stand up under the close scrutiny of the
alumni of "today." The answer is yes, for the Stanford
undergraduate of today is in many instances the off
spring of the Stanford man of yesterday, a "chip off
the old block." one might say. They arc students whose
father or mother before them passed through the
portals of Stanford: they, too, had measured tip to the
generation of Stanford men and women who had pre
ceded them, a kind of connecting link between the Stan
ford of yesterday, today, and tomorrow.

IT has been the boast of Stanford, when speaking of
athletics or organized play, that the majority of
Stanford students are not only "of the game" but "in
the game." This is just as it should be, for sane, whole
some, competitive athletics not only betters a student
physically, but teaches him many things that will prove
valuable in later life—self-confidenee, self-control, self
,discipline, self-reliance, the ability to concentrate and
to plan one's own campaign, to execute one's own
plans, and to keep alive and healthy one's ideals.
