# Levin Fictionizes Story Of Republic Steel Strike
## 
### 
"Citizens" by Meyer Levin. Viking
Press.
Cardinal points in the young Chi
cago school of authors, headed by
James Farrell, are (a) type charac
ters and (b) case histories. The
author of "Studs Lonigan" holds to
the rule, but expands it so that his
particular type of characters become
individuals; and maybe it's a good
idea.
At any rate, "Citizens" is not the
book it might have been, principally
because of Levin's rigid adherence
to Rule A. When he's following out
the second tenet, he really manages
to make his book worth while.
BROAD-MINDED CITIZEN
This book is a Actionized version
of the Republic Steel strike; but
Levin deliberately lictionized so that
he might be free to interpret and
conjecture. His major character is
Dr. Mitchell Wilner, an allergist,
who happens to be at the mill the
day that eight strikers are killed
by the police.
The rest of the book deals with
Wilner's efTorts, as a liberal, fair
minded citizen with access to the
facts, to find out just what the whole
thing was all about. The doctor is
the type—you, me, any bourgeois
who doesn't happen to own Little
Steel stock.
MAIN CHARACTER FLOPS
But, oddly enough, that's the mis
take. Wilner, because he was sup
posed to be everyone, ends up by
not being much of anyone. He is
motivated almost entirely for de
lineation purposes; thus his move
ments are jerky and unreal.
You can't, however, quarrel with
what Levin is trying to say. And, if
you accept Wilner, you will cer
tainly be moved by the rest of the
book. In his "case histories" of the
dead strikers, he gives clinical, sor
did portraits — a little sickening
sometimes, but never without pur
pose.
Best thing in the book, and some
thing that we'll wager makes you
take at least ten minutes out to
ponder, is the testimony at the

i Gottschalk Hearing in Washington.
You'll think it's exaggerated—that
such abysmal misinformation could
exist, or such statements be accepted
as truth. Then you'll read Levin's
final explanatory chapter and find
out that that is the word-for-word
testimony given at the LaFollette
Hearing. Believe me, it's incred
ible.—Nowell
