CO-WORKER OE HUXLEY
Of Gerald Heard's latest book, his
co-worker, Aldous Huxley, has writ
ten, "It represents a significant at
tempt, to reinterpret in contempo
rary terms and in the light of mod
ern knowledge the teachings, prac
tical no less than theoretical, of the
traditional religious philosophies.
"At a moment like the present,
when the humanistic philosophy of
progress is revealing itself as hope
lessly unrealistic, and when ever
increasing numbers of reflective
people are sinking through bewilder
ment into despair, the publication of
"Pain, Sex, and Time," seems pecu
liarly opportune."
