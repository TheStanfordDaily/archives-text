### WILSON CANNON 
jVEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN is be
ginning to worry about his own
back yard.
11l at ease before an unruly
House of Commons yesterday, Brit
ain's Prime Minister admitted for
the first time the possibility of a
Gorman lightning war into England
itself.
He indicated that a growing fear
among Britons held that Hitler may
strike directly at the British Isles,
perhaps even with an attempted in
vasion with parachute troops.
At the same time, Chamberlain
moved to placate unruly opposi
tion members by elevating fiery
Winston Churchill to the position
of first War Lord of England.
Churchill will steer England's war
chariot for the duration of World
War 11, Chamlierlaln indicated.
If Chamberlain continues as Prime
Minister.
He spoke before the Commons in
a desperate hour-long attempt to ex
plain the government's position in
the recent Norwegian fiasco. Ming
ling explanations with pleadings and
warnings, the 71-year-old Prime
Minister begged an ending of "the
quarrels among ourselves."
His move lifting Churchill as the
guiding destiny of Engalnd's war
machine also included an attempt to
placate opposition members by add
ing them to the remnants of his bat
tered war cabinet.
* * *
|{UT Chamberlain's pleas were
drowned by unruly cries of "Re
sign, resign." United Press dispatches
strongly indicated that he utterly
failed to quell the rising domestic
storm.
At one time during his speech the
crescendo of ridicule and booing
reached such a point that the aged
Prime Minister was forced to sit
down until order was restored.
Many of those present believed
that Chamberlain would succeed
in saving his cabinet. But they
were certain that the price would
Ik» a severe political drubbing and
the loss of considerable prestige.
Flurries of the House of Commons
verbal battle quieted somewhat
when mention of Paul Reynaud's
French cabinet was made. Previous
ly, indications from Paris held that
if Chamberlain fell, the French
government would also be upset.
Chamberlain's speech was dusted
with reminiscences of Britain's glo
rious past. At one dramatic climax
he called to mind the fact that Eng
land has not felt the foot of a con
queror since 1066.
United Press reports termed the l
session the most dramatic since
Edward VII abdicated "for the love
of an American woman."
* «
RUT the major portion of Cham
berlain's plea was a straight
forward struggle to keep his cabinet
from toppling.
In announcing the war lordship of
Churchill, Chamberlain promised
that "every aspect of military policy
will be examined, and will be fol
lowed up with promptness."
Berlin, ridiculing Churchill's new
powers, termed him England's most
verbose statesman. Fiery, red
headed Churchill is the most carica
tured man in all Germany.
Even in England there was seme
criticism of Chamberlain's new war
strategy. Churchill was assailed
with bitter denunciation by labor
members of the Commons.
A second indication that Eng
land is preparing for definite ac
tion came when the Prime Min
ister promised that "all possible
aid" will be given the Norwe
gians. Boisterous cheers greeted
his statement that the war against
Germany in Norway will go on.
Chamberlain had little to offer in
his explanation of the Allied rout in
Nnnvay. His only excuse was an
undersupply of available British
manpower.
He repeated his earlier claim that
the Allies were defeated only by
superior air strength.
No mention was made of future
definite war strategy.

among Britons held that Hitler may
