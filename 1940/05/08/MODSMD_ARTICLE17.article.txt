# Wilbur Speaks At Convention
## State Doctors Hear Of Medical Progress 
### 
"The amazing advance in the ap
plication of chemistry and physics
to biological processes is revolution
izing medicine," President Ray Ly
man Wilbur declared yesterday in
addressing the annual convention of
the California Medical Association
at Coronado.
Speaking on the subject of "Bio
logical Engineers," Dr. Wilbur told
the convention that the physician
can no longer be symbolized by pills
and scalpels because "he is becom
ing a biological engineer serving the
individual and society in many fresh
and startling ways."
Discussing the change in the activ
ities of the medical practitioner
through the last 50 years, he re
minded his listeners that 50 years ago
the functions of the medical man
were largely determined by obser
vation and experience. Since then,
however, "experimentation and
analysis have been brought in at
such a rapid rate that at times we
almost forget that over the centuries
medicine was largely based upon
shrewd observation and the accu
mulation and digestion of past ex
periences."
Dr. Wilbur talked of the way in
which the general advance in all the
fields of science had immeasurably
aided the field of medicine. Con
cerning biology he said, "As our
knowledge of the different forms of
life about us, including bacteria and
viruses as well as insects and proto
zoa, increases, our skill in con
trolling the diseases caused by para
sites has grown."
Similar advances in other fields,
such as the development of chem
ical remedies, of which quinine is a
good example, have likewise helped
the medical man, the lecturer stated.
