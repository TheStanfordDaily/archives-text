sive returns from the state's
Presidential primaries.

slate of delegates holding a 7 to 1
lead, Zach Laniarr Cobb, co-mana
gcr of the campaign of Vice-Presi
dent John Nance Garner, conceded
defeat for his group and congratu
lated "the President and the dele
gation elected in his name."
Garner's group ran second, a slate
of ham and egg pension supporters
pledged nominally to Willis Allen
third, and a left-wing group headed
by Lieutenant Governor Ellis Pat
terson fourth in the Democratic race.

Lack of interest among Republi
can voters for the unopposed and
uninstructed G.O.P. delegation held
down the total vote, although the
weather was clear. Registrar of

out. was "apathetic."
In San Francisco, second largest
city, Acting Registrar of Voters I. D.
Dwyer said one-sixth of the regis
tration voted in the early hours and
djubted that more than 190,000 of
the city's 348,000 voters would visit
the polls.

SAN FRANCISCO, May 7 (CP).
— President Roosevelt captured
California's 44 Democratic con
vention votes tonight on the basis
of incomplete but fairly conclu
sive returns from the state's
Presidential primaries.
With the Roosevelt thud-term
slate of delegates holding a 7 to 1
lead, Zach Laniarr Cobb, co-mana
gcr of the campaign of Vice-Presi
dent John Nance Garner, conceded
defeat for his group and congratu
lated "the President and the dele
gation elected in his name."
Garner's group ran second, a slate
of ham and egg pension supporters
pledged nominally to Willis Allen
third, and a left-wing group headed
by Lieutenant Governor Ellis Pat
terson fourth in the Democratic race.
The Allen and Patterson delegations
were not pledged to any Presidential
candidate.
The Republican primary presented
only one ticket, a slate of unin
structed delegates.
Returns from 7,469 of the state's
13,510 precincts gave:
Roosevelt 271,552
Garner 42,070
Allen (ham and eggs) 31,172
Patterson 18,271
In the same precincts the single
unopposed Republican slate polled
211,012.
The vote was light. It was esti
mated about 35 to 40 per cent of the
eligible registration cast ballots in
their respective party primaries.
Lack of interest among Republi
can voters for the unopposed and
