# Drive Spotlight Shifts; Lamb Barbecue, Dance To Close Workers' Day
## All Stanford Family Urged to Work In Weeding Effort; Entertainment To Include Spring Show Preview 
### 
Stanford's far-famed "rough" takes the spotlight today as the Farm
dons overalls and blue jeans and trudges out to the Convalescent Home,
for Day.
Barbecued lamb will be served at 5 o'clock under the direction of Hugh
O'Don 11 el I, chairman of the barbecue committee, while entertainment will

►be furnished in the nature of a pre
view of Spring Show skits. No din
ners will be served at living groups.
"We realize that by spring quar
ter there are many students whose
funds are so depleted they cannot
afford to contribute monetary aid to
the Convalescent Home Drive," said
Labor Day Co-cnairmen John All
tucker and Bob Breckner yesterday.
"However," they continued, "there
is no financial obligation involved in
coming out to Labor Day. Further
more, the Home is sorely in need of
weeding and hoeing, and if we stu-

dents don't do the work they will be
in a bad spot."
Ned Pugh, general chairman of
this year's Home Drive, urges all
members of the Stanford Family to
turn out and participate in Labor
Day. Explaining that there are five
parts to the Stanford Family—stu
dents, faculty, alumni, trustees, and
friends—Pugh pointed out that a
closer unity will be promoted within
the Family by co-operating side by
side in an informal manner.
Leland Cutler, president of the
Board of Trustees, will be present—
overalls and all—for the festivities,
while Mrs. Timothy Hopkins, el
derly donor of many of the Home's
buildings, will be a spectator. Mrs.
Hopkins has not missed being pres
ent at Labor Day for several years.
TRUSTEES PARTICIPATE
Frank Walker, another trustee,
and Ira S. Lillirk, head of the Con
valescent Home Board, have also
signified their intention of being
present.
Tommy / Howard, Encina Club
president, issued a plea yesterday
for all frosh men to turn out en
masse.
"There is no time like our fresh
man year to get out and get the feH
of an indigenous Stanford activity—
especially one as worth while as this
one," stated Howard.
Punch will be served for hungry
workers, the proceeds to be donated
to the Home Drive.

between 7 and 9 o'clock will climax
