I'illy-one per cent disapproved. 39 per cent were in favor of it. while
10 per cent are undecided.
In the same survey, students were asked what should be done if
Slarilord s financial condition becomes critical. Forty per cent sug

per cent: "drastically cut all department budgets," \oted 10 per cent;
become a state school. <1 per cent: and 13 per cent were undecided,
or presented other suggestions.
A breakdown of the sample, compiled scientifically to be repre
sentative ol the campus, reveals that independents (students living off

Men and women students approve an increase about equally, but
•>l per cent of the men condemn it. while only 47 per eent of the
women disapprove. Women were more undecided than the men.
Many suggestions to solve a financial crisis were advanced by the
students questioned; some far-fetched—others practical, while a few
business grads dealt with the technical, financial problem.
I wo suggestions by freshmen were, "Slop research and make this
a school to leach students." and "More athletic scholarships and better
football teams will pull us out of the rut. This school is < uttins; off the
hand that feeds it.
"Increased tuition will mean smaller enrollment; increased enroll
ment, greater expenses. If you decrease salaries and budgets, you get
inefficient teaching. It leaves only one alternative—a state school. The
slate can afford the honor the campus brings it." writes a grad student.
