# British Author Talks on Series
## 
### RUTH RICHMOND 
i Like a prosecuting attorney be- j
fore a grand jury, Gerald Heard, i
British philosopher and author, ar
gued the case for the evolution of :
! human consciousness before a '
Tuesday Evening Series audience 1
last night.
Beginning with the first traces of
paleolithic man and following
through to the Nazi military psy
chology, Mr. Heard showed the
differences in consciousness reflected
in art, religion, and statesmanship.
Of the prehistoirc remains he
commented, "These skulls do give us
a series of steps, a staircase, from i
the ape to man. There is a massive j
change in the brain and corre- '
spondingly a massive change in I
consciousness."
"I think George the Third's micro
scope is the last one with a floral
motif," Mr. Heard pointed out to
prove the basic fissure of conscious
ness between an age which "never j
thinks in terms of efficiency and
i change," and this one in which the
tool is merely the means of achiev
ing the end. :
The very violence required to
maintain it is a proof that totalitar- |
ian ism is not the solution for the
present world turmoil, according to '
Mr. Heard.
