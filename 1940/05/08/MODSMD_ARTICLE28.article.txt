# University Graduate Students Mother Exotic Jungle Animal
## 
### JAN GOULD 
Be it coddling eight live rattle
snakes or putting up an exotic
jungle beast, Malcom "Bud" Nobs
and Jim Raynes, graduate students,
are the ones to oblige.
And their kindness is equalled
only by their calmness.
Last year a friend left a boxful of
rattlers in their room at Toyon;
and, perhaps with this in mind, Nobs'
brother, Ken Nobs, one time varsity
basketballer and now globe trotter,
dropped in at 469 Harvard Street
Sunday evening with a cage contain
ing the only Night Loris in the
United States.
HIS NAME IS TIMBU
Here, he said, is a rare and val
uable animal. Name is Timbu
Matur, after the Philippine Island
Ken found it on. Very tired from a
stay in quarantine; would Bud and
Jim mind?
Bud and Jim wouldn't.
So now the tiny sloth lives in an
evil smelling cage in the door of
Raynes' closet.
HE BITES TOO
"Strong little devil," Raynes re- j
marked as he prepared to show off j
Timbu to friends. "Bites. Through
these gloves? He hasn't yet."
The animal weighs only three or
four pounds, and is the color of |
dead leaves. It has no tail, and its |
back legs are as strongly developed !
as a frog's.
He tried to tear the limpet away i
from the bar it clung to, head down- ;
ward. "We tried to pull him off a !
chair last night," he continued, "but:
he held it so tight that as we lifted ■
him by the halter he pulled the chair >
into the air after him."
EJ, CUADRO PLEDGES
To date the slow-moving little j
creature has been offered meals of
avacadoes, bananas, and condensed
milk, has shivered only slightly in
the overheated room, and has been
made an honorary member of El j
Cuadro. In spite of it all, however, !
Raynes fears that it might sicken i
and die before Ken Nobs completes !
a deal with a zoo or circus.
"I imagine it's worth a couple of
hundred or so, but a little more of
this and I'd close it out at 98 cents," j

Raynes said. "These sloths aren't
exactly on their toes anyway,
though, and I suppose it had one
hell of a time getting through cus
toms with itself."
The only place in China's vast
areas where trout can be found are
in the streams of the imperial hunt
ing grounds in the extreme north
east.

United States.
HIS NAME IS TIMBU
Here, he said, is a rare and val
uable animal. Name is Timbu
Matur, after the Philippine Island
Ken found it on. Very tired from a
stay in quarantine; would Bud and
Jim mind?
Bud and Jim wouldn't.
So now the tiny sloth lives in an
evil smelling cage in the door of
Raynes' closet.
HE BITES TOO
"Strong little devil," Raynes re- j
marked as he prepared to show off j
Timbu to friends. "Bites. Through
these gloves? He hasn't yet."
The animal weighs only three or
four pounds, and is the color of |
dead leaves. It has no tail, and its |
back legs are as strongly developed !
as a frog's.
He tried to tear the limpet away i
from the bar it clung to, head down- ;
ward. "We tried to pull him off a !
chair last night," he continued, "but:
he held it so tight that as we lifted ■
him by the halter he pulled the chair >
into the air after him."
EJ, CUADRO PLEDGES
To date the slow-moving little j
creature has been offered meals of
avacadoes, bananas, and condensed
milk, has shivered only slightly in
the overheated room, and has been
made an honorary member of El j
Cuadro. In spite of it all, however, !
Raynes fears that it might sicken i
and die before Ken Nobs completes !
a deal with a zoo or circus.
"I imagine it's worth a couple of
hundred or so, but a little more of
this and I'd close it out at 98 cents," j

Raynes said. "These sloths aren't
exactly on their toes anyway,
though, and I suppose it had one
hell of a time getting through cus
toms with itself."
The only place in China's vast
areas where trout can be found are
in the streams of the imperial hunt
ing grounds in the extreme north
east.
Be it coddling eight live rattle
snakes or putting up an exotic
jungle beast, Malcom "Bud" Nobs
and Jim Raynes, graduate students,
are the ones to oblige.
And their kindness is equalled
only by their calmness.
Last year a friend left a boxful of
rattlers in their room at Toyon;
and, perhaps with this in mind, Nobs'
brother, Ken Nobs, one time varsity
basketballer and now globe trotter,
dropped in at 469 Harvard Street
Sunday evening with a cage contain
ing the only Night Loris in the
United States.
