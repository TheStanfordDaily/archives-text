The year 1940 will he quite an im
portant date after track is over this
sprint? and summer and whtfn the
revised list of Stanford records is
posted in Don Liebendorfer's office.
Already five records have been
hung up hy members of Coach Hill
Islington's squad and in all proba
bility four or five other marks
could be set up before the year is
over if the men 1 have in mind
continue to improve as they have
within the last month.
The most remarkable thing about
the new records on Stanford's own
books is that two are world rec
ords, two are the best marks ever
established by Pacific Coast per
formers, and one is the second best
mark established by a Coast athlete.
Here's the way we figure:
>* $ $
CAPTAIN CLYDE JEFFREY, who
has thoroughly debunked Dean
Cromwell's theory that if he went to
Stanford and worked under the
Templeton methods of training he
would eventually go sour, has his
name down twice — once this year
and once last.
I lis "hundred" at the Long Beach
Relays. March 1 <». tied the accepted
world's mark at 9.4 seconds, and
that, of course, supplanted his own
9.5 of a year ago and Hector Dy
er's 9.0 of 1933. Then last year
Jiffy Jeff, as some papers term
him, got in a 20.5 220-yard dash,
which, although it wasn't in a reg
ularly scheduled meet, is accept
able because there were enough
recognized timers present. 11 you
don't want to count that, then Jelf
has a 20.8 established in the l!K»i)
Big Meet.
So far this year, Jeff has been so
busy running the quarter-mile as
part of the Farm's mile relay team
that he hasn't been able to put his
mind to the business of running un
der 20.9 seconds. However, I think
I'll keep him on my track club.
Two slow tracks—the Stanford
Stadium and the Coliseum—kept
Jeff from putting his name down
•»n the meet record books for the
Big Meet and Trojan-Indian com
petition. He could have easily
erased Foy Draper's 20.9 last Sat
urday if there hadn't been such a
sitfi gale, and his 9.8 "hundred" is
either due to the wind or else the
"slow" clocking of those notorious
Southern California officials.
The Big Meet 220 mark is his, but
Bob Keisel's 9.6 was impossible to
touch in the Wind-Tunnel. But de
spite the fact his name won't be on
the list of meet records, Clyde Jef
frey will long be remembered as the
best American spirnter in 1938, 1939,
and 1940. and the chances are he'll
be unbeatable next year when he
runs for the Winged "O."
Jjt £ #
THE OTHER WORLD record goes
to the Farm foursome, on whom
reams and reams of columns have
been wirtten. Craig Williamson,
Charley Shaw, Ernie Clark, and Jef
frey may lower their present 3:10.5
mark either this Saturday night «t
the West Coast Relays in Fresno or
else in the Finnish Rcilef Meet in
L.A., May 16, the P.C.C., May 25,
the Compton Relays, June 7, the
N.C.2A., June 22, or the National
A.A.U. in Fresno.
* # *
STAN ANDERSEN, everyone now
says, Ls a match for A1 Blozis of
Georgetown University or Elmer
Hackney of Kansas State, who beat
him last year in the N.C.2A. We
contend that he always has been a
match, and that Saturday's toss of
55 feet 3 :t .» inches was hardly a
reason to get on Stan's bandwagon,
lie's been ready for a long time
to toss that iron ball out there.
Against the Trojans — just as
against the Bears—he started the
Indians off; in that heave of his he
broke Johnny Lyman's old mark.
Everyone knew Stan was com
ing. because all week long he was
throwing the thing around 53 feet,
and on that one heave he did ev
erything just right.
We're sorry that Andy won't also
be able to get closer to Pete Zagar's
discus mark, but we believe he could
had he started throwing the platter
a couple of years sooner. Now that
he has tried it for a year, Andy ac
tually likes to toss the discus better
than putting the shot.
* * *
THEN THERE'S MOORE'S new
mile standard. Every week it goes
down a notch, but it's now posted
(temporarily) at 4:11.5 done at the
great Louie Zamperini's discomfort.
Now that Paul has displaced
Zamp as the kingpin of Coast dis
tance men. there is nothing but
seven seconds standing between
him and Sidney Wooderson's mile
mark somewhere around 4:01 plus.
Ellington figures that Paul will be
ready to make a stab at it in the
P.C.C.

(temporarily) at 4:11.5 done at the
great Louie Zamperini's discomfort.
Now that Paul has displaced
Zamp as the kingpin of Coast dis
tance men. there is nothing but
seven seconds standing between
him and Sidney Wooderson's mile
mark somewhere around 4:01 plus.
Ellington figures that Paul will be
ready to make a stab at it in the
P.C.C.
The year 1940 will he quite an im
portant date after track is over this
sprint? and summer and whtfn the
revised list of Stanford records is
posted in Don Liebendorfer's office.
Already five records have been
hung up hy members of Coach Hill
Islington's squad and in all proba
bility four or five other marks
could be set up before the year is
over if the men 1 have in mind
continue to improve as they have
within the last month.
The most remarkable thing about
the new records on Stanford's own
books is that two are world rec
ords, two are the best marks ever
established by Pacific Coast per
formers, and one is the second best
mark established by a Coast athlete.
Here's the way we figure:
>* $ $
CAPTAIN CLYDE JEFFREY, who
has thoroughly debunked Dean
Cromwell's theory that if he went to
Stanford and worked under the
Templeton methods of training he
would eventually go sour, has his
name down twice — once this year
and once last.
I lis "hundred" at the Long Beach
Relays. March 1 <». tied the accepted
world's mark at 9.4 seconds, and
that, of course, supplanted his own
9.5 of a year ago and Hector Dy
er's 9.0 of 1933. Then last year
Jiffy Jeff, as some papers term
him, got in a 20.5 220-yard dash,
which, although it wasn't in a reg
ularly scheduled meet, is accept
able because there were enough
recognized timers present. 11 you
don't want to count that, then Jelf
has a 20.8 established in the l!K»i)
Big Meet.
So far this year, Jeff has been so
busy running the quarter-mile as
part of the Farm's mile relay team
that he hasn't been able to put his
mind to the business of running un
der 20.9 seconds. However, I think
I'll keep him on my track club.
Two slow tracks—the Stanford
Stadium and the Coliseum—kept
Jeff from putting his name down
•»n the meet record books for the
Big Meet and Trojan-Indian com
petition. He could have easily
erased Foy Draper's 20.9 last Sat
urday if there hadn't been such a
sitfi gale, and his 9.8 "hundred" is
either due to the wind or else the
"slow" clocking of those notorious
Southern California officials.
The Big Meet 220 mark is his, but
Bob Keisel's 9.6 was impossible to
touch in the Wind-Tunnel. But de
spite the fact his name won't be on
the list of meet records, Clyde Jef
frey will long be remembered as the
best American spirnter in 1938, 1939,
and 1940. and the chances are he'll
be unbeatable next year when he
runs for the Winged "O."
Jjt £ #
THE OTHER WORLD record goes
to the Farm foursome, on whom
reams and reams of columns have
been wirtten. Craig Williamson,
Charley Shaw, Ernie Clark, and Jef
frey may lower their present 3:10.5
mark either this Saturday night «t
the West Coast Relays in Fresno or
else in the Finnish Rcilef Meet in
L.A., May 16, the P.C.C., May 25,
the Compton Relays, June 7, the
N.C.2A., June 22, or the National
A.A.U. in Fresno.

STAN ANDERSEN, everyone now
says, Ls a match for A1 Blozis of
Georgetown University or Elmer
Hackney of Kansas State, who beat
him last year in the N.C.2A. We
contend that he always has been a
match, and that Saturday's toss of
55 feet 3 :t .» inches was hardly a
reason to get on Stan's bandwagon,
lie's been ready for a long time
to toss that iron ball out there.
Against the Trojans — just as
against the Bears—he started the
Indians off; in that heave of his he
broke Johnny Lyman's old mark.
Everyone knew Stan was com
ing. because all week long he was
throwing the thing around 53 feet,
and on that one heave he did ev
erything just right.
We're sorry that Andy won't also
be able to get closer to Pete Zagar's
discus mark, but we believe he could
had he started throwing the platter
a couple of years sooner. Now that
he has tried it for a year, Andy ac

than putting the shot.

be able to get closer to Pete Zagar's

THEN THERE'S MOORE'S new
mile standard. Every week it goes
down a notch, but it's now posted
(temporarily) at 4:11.5 done at the
great Louie Zamperini's discomfort.
Now that Paul has displaced
Zamp as the kingpin of Coast dis
tance men. there is nothing but
seven seconds standing between
him and Sidney Wooderson's mile
mark somewhere around 4:01 plus.
Ellington figures that Paul will be
ready to make a stab at it in the
P.C.C.
The year 1940 will he quite an im
portant date after track is over this
sprint? and summer and whtfn the
revised list of Stanford records is
posted in Don Liebendorfer's office.
Already five records have been
hung up hy members of Coach Hill
Islington's squad and in all proba
bility four or five other marks
could be set up before the year is
over if the men 1 have in mind
continue to improve as they have
within the last month.
The most remarkable thing about
the new records on Stanford's own
books is that two are world rec
ords, two are the best marks ever
established by Pacific Coast per
formers, and one is the second best
mark established by a Coast athlete.
Here's the way we figure:
>* $ $
CAPTAIN CLYDE JEFFREY, who
has thoroughly debunked Dean
Cromwell's theory that if he went to
Stanford and worked under the
Templeton methods of training he
would eventually go sour, has his
name down twice — once this year
and once last.
I lis "hundred" at the Long Beach
Relays. March 1 <». tied the accepted
world's mark at 9.4 seconds, and
that, of course, supplanted his own
9.5 of a year ago and Hector Dy
er's 9.0 of 1933. Then last year
Jiffy Jeff, as some papers term
him, got in a 20.5 220-yard dash,
which, although it wasn't in a reg
ularly scheduled meet, is accept
able because there were enough
recognized timers present. 11 you
don't want to count that, then Jelf
has a 20.8 established in the l!K»i)
Big Meet.
So far this year, Jeff has been so
busy running the quarter-mile as
part of the Farm's mile relay team
that he hasn't been able to put his
mind to the business of running un
der 20.9 seconds. However, I think
I'll keep him on my track club.
Two slow tracks—the Stanford
Stadium and the Coliseum—kept
Jeff from putting his name down
•»n the meet record books for the
Big Meet and Trojan-Indian com
petition. He could have easily
erased Foy Draper's 20.9 last Sat
urday if there hadn't been such a
sitfi gale, and his 9.8 "hundred" is
either due to the wind or else the
"slow" clocking of those notorious
Southern California officials.
The Big Meet 220 mark is his, but
Bob Keisel's 9.6 was impossible to
touch in the Wind-Tunnel. But de
spite the fact his name won't be on
the list of meet records, Clyde Jef
frey will long be remembered as the
best American spirnter in 1938, 1939,
and 1940. and the chances are he'll
be unbeatable next year when he
runs for the Winged "O."
Jjt £ #
THE OTHER WORLD record goes
to the Farm foursome, on whom
reams and reams of columns have
been wirtten. Craig Williamson,
Charley Shaw, Ernie Clark, and Jef
frey may lower their present 3:10.5
mark either this Saturday night «t
the West Coast Relays in Fresno or
else in the Finnish Rcilef Meet in
L.A., May 16, the P.C.C., May 25,
the Compton Relays, June 7, the
N.C.2A., June 22, or the National
A.A.U. in Fresno.

STAN ANDERSEN, everyone now
says, Ls a match for A1 Blozis of
Georgetown University or Elmer
Hackney of Kansas State, who beat
him last year in the N.C.2A. We
contend that he always has been a
match, and that Saturday's toss of
55 feet 3 :t .» inches was hardly a
reason to get on Stan's bandwagon,
lie's been ready for a long time
to toss that iron ball out there.
Against the Trojans — just as
against the Bears—he started the
Indians off; in that heave of his he
broke Johnny Lyman's old mark.
Everyone knew Stan was com
ing. because all week long he was
throwing the thing around 53 feet,
and on that one heave he did ev
erything just right.
We're sorry that Andy won't also
