### CHUCK SMITH 
Those Fresno Relays this com
ing Saturday are going to mean a
lot of hard work for Stanford's
track captain and world's fastest
human, Clyde Jeffrey,
In the first place, Captain Jeff is j
| going to have to run a couple of
heats for the invitational 100-yard
! dash before the finals. Add to these â– 
I three races his three laps in the
| relays, one of 110 yards in the four
: man quarter-mile relay, one lap of !
i 220 yards in the four-man half-mile,
] and one quarter-mile lap on the
| world record holding mile relay
: team.
Though he won't run as often,
Paul Moore will run farther than
Jeffrey. Paul will be called upon by
I Coach Bill Ellington to turn in two
I anchor laps. The one will be in ;
; the two-mile relay in which each
J man runs a half-mile. Then Paul
will wind up the medley relay with
J a full mile in a rematch with the
| great Louie Zamperini.
Mush Girard will be another busy !
j boy down at Fresno, and he proved }
I himself fully capable of handling
his two assignments by clicking off i
I another 1:55 half-mile last night,
j Mush will run a lap on the two- :
; mile team and will run third man on
j the medley, which means 1320 more
yards for him to cover.
I In the other relay races Coach
I Ellington will have plenty of men
to juggle around.
