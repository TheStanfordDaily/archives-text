# Gallarneau, Standlee Highlight Scrum; 100 Spectators Watch
## 
### 
A pair of breakaway dashes by Hugh Gallarneau and Norm Standlec
highlighted festivities on the varsity practice fiyld yesterday, when Coach
Clark Shaughncssy's gridders went through a heavy scrum session before
about 100 spectators, licth runs were made against the liflh string.
Ihc "A" squad presented a revamped line, with sophomores Hank
Norberg and Ed St amm at ends.^

j Bruno Banducci and Winkie Jones
|at tackles, Johnny Kerman and
j Chick Orme at guards, and Doug
Stahle at center. The regular back
field of Gallarneau, Siandlee,
Frankie Albert and Pete Kmetovic
j rounded out the first team.
This quintet has functioned as a
j unit since spring practice started,
j Gallarneau has looked especially
good in the three scrimmages to date,
his speed being especially suited to
the fast-breaking style of play
| that the Indians are using.
The first string showed a good
deal of improvement over last week's
scrimmages, with the blocking and
ball-handling departments much
smoother than in the first two
scrums. Norberg and Stamm on the
wings looked especially good, both
| blocking and snagging Albert's
! southpaw tosses. This duo might
I conceivably edge out the more ex
perienced Stan Graff and Freddie
Meyer for the regular flank jobs
next fall.
Alter the first team had finished
running through the fifth, the sec
ond and third strings had at each
other for about a half hour, with
honors evenly divided.
