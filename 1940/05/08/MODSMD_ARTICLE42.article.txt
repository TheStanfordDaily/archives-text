good an indication as any that the Friends are giv
ing the student body every possible opportunity.
I he ideal entertainment suggestion would be an
hour and a half at the jollv-up in the Women's Gym
for a dime and then a spectator s seat at the quartet's
concert. This happy combination, all olTered for a
thin-one or twenty cents a couple, is one of the bar
gains of the quarter, especially when vou remember
thai an anemic tomato juice at the I nion alone costs
fill ecu cents.
\loreo\er the jolly-up heads \\ ill be happv because
every one paid their dimes, including a bevy of
exotic coeds, and the Friends of Music can sit back
with ihe realization that they have been part of a
deed well done.
