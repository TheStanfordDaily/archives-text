EDITOR, SIR:
So—the campus that rates Glenn Miller tops is
going to get a schmaltzy bunch of paper men that
few have heard of to give the seniors the quintessence
of dance music for the Senior Ball!
The inside on this, for those who rarely read be
yond the first paragraph of a news story, is that
Student Manager John Cobbs, sho' nuff the 111., felt
that it was strictly immoral for the seniors to spend
$1500 for Benny Goodman or $1750 for Glenn Miller.
So the seniors, who can't be blamed for paying eight
bucks a crack for a good band are now going to pay
eight bucks a crack for one of the saltiest salon groups
that ever spent 2G weeks on sustaining.
If economy and quality were the keynotes, why
didn't the orchestra committee consider Ray Noble,
who winds up at the Palace approximately on the
same date as the Ball?
Or why not Chuck Foster? Or Will Osborne?
I fear the committee wouldn't know a good band,
ooshy or otherwise, if one was discovered under their
respective beds.
