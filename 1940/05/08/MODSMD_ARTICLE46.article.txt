KLUCKS OF THE KLAN
jJEMOCRACY is a government of laws, not of men.
That's what statesmen and professors and pub
licists are always telling us. And outside of Jersey
City the maxim usually holds good in America. At
least there is more government of law here than there
is in a number of other places one might mention.
But every now and then there is an eruption of
mobbery. And one thinks that democracy is a gov
ernment of many laws, and that one of those laws
is the law of the savage—the law of the jungle. At
such times, when an organized mob seizes the cow
ardly power of violence, it is shocking to see the
reactions of many "leading" citizens, fine old pillars
of society who like to think of themselves as membei's
of the "upper class."
A few years ago a pack of howling primates smashed
its way into a San Jose jail, seized two men accused
of kidnapping, pummeled and tortured ,them, dragged
Ihem through the streets, and hanged them to a tree.
And many of California's "solid" citizens thought "the
two men had it coming to them." Our erstwhile Gov
ernor, "Sunny Jim" Rolph, as a matter of fact, ex
pressed that very opinion.
But such examples of mob violence represent vol
canic eruptions of hysteria and human cruelty. They
are paled by the calculated, well organized mobs whose
express purpose it is to rule by terror and lawless
force.

HPHE Black Legion and Ku Klux Klan are blacker
marks on America's reputation than A1 Capone or
John DillLnger and their outlaws. The outlaws were
thieves who never rose from the city streets. But
many of the Klansmen and Black Legionnaires were
just such "solid" citizens as those who condoned the
San Jose lynching.
California's contribution to sham democracy has for
some years been "The Associated Farmers," first cous
ins of the spirit of the Klan. One of their leaders, a
prominent California rancher, believed in "taking the
law into our own hands if necessary" and organizing
vigilantes "armed with pitchforks."
And now it turns out that The Associated Fanners
are not alone. Several groups of hoodlums have re
organized the Ku Klux Klan in California. Their pur
pose, ironically enough, is "to fight insidious enemies
of democracy." In spite of an enforced training period
in at least grammar school civics, they don't even
know what democracy means.
Fortunately, the Klan will probably not ride very
far in California. It will only kluck in an obnoxious
way. But it seems that the Klucks are always with us.

A few years ago a pack of howling primates smashed
its way into a San Jose jail, seized two men accused
of kidnapping, pummeled and tortured ,them, dragged
Ihem through the streets, and hanged them to a tree.
And many of California's "solid" citizens thought "the
two men had it coming to them." Our erstwhile Gov
ernor, "Sunny Jim" Rolph, as a matter of fact, ex
pressed that very opinion.
But such examples of mob violence represent vol
canic eruptions of hysteria and human cruelty. They
are paled by the calculated, well organized mobs whose
express purpose it is to rule by terror and lawless
force.

HPHE Black Legion and Ku Klux Klan are blacker
marks on America's reputation than A1 Capone or
John DillLnger and their outlaws. The outlaws were
thieves who never rose from the city streets. But
many of the Klansmen and Black Legionnaires were
just such "solid" citizens as those who condoned the
San Jose lynching.
California's contribution to sham democracy has for
some years been "The Associated Farmers," first cous
ins of the spirit of the Klan. One of their leaders, a
prominent California rancher, believed in "taking the
law into our own hands if necessary" and organizing
vigilantes "armed with pitchforks."
And now it turns out that The Associated Fanners
are not alone. Several groups of hoodlums have re
organized the Ku Klux Klan in California. Their pur
pose, ironically enough, is "to fight insidious enemies
of democracy." In spite of an enforced training period
in at least grammar school civics, they don't even
know what democracy means.
Fortunately, the Klan will probably not ride very
far in California. It will only kluck in an obnoxious
way. But it seems that the Klucks are always with us.

jJEMOCRACY is a government of laws, not of men.
That's what statesmen and professors and pub
licists are always telling us. And outside of Jersey
City the maxim usually holds good in America. At
least there is more government of law here than there
is in a number of other places one might mention.
But every now and then there is an eruption of
mobbery. And one thinks that democracy is a gov
ernment of many laws, and that one of those laws
is the law of the savage—the law of the jungle. At
such times, when an organized mob seizes the cow
ardly power of violence, it is shocking to see the
reactions of many "leading" citizens, fine old pillars
of society who like to think of themselves as membei's
of the "upper class."
