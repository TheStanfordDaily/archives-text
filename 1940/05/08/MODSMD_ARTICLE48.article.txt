# 'OKIES' OF THE MIDWEST?

| ATELY "The Grapes of Wrath," both book and pic
~J ture, has fearlessly called the nation's attention to
sharecropper conditions in the South's dust bowl region
and to tho problem of caring for the impoverished,
work-seeking "Okie" in California. Through his starkly
realistic story, Steinbeck has undoubtedly startled
many persons into realizing America's greatest re
gional evil. Whether or not something will be done
about the evil is another matter —of either futile
shame or helpful legislation.

But the South alone does not have the only regional
small-farmer-tenant problem. We of the Midwest,
whether we realize it or not, are beginning to have
such a problem, too. And soon we also will need a
Steinbeck—if a certain agricultural condition is al
lowed to blunder on its way. For in the last few
years—and noticeably this spring—many small tenant
farmers have been "orphaned" from their land like
the now well known "Okies." The "land-hog" or "big"
farmer has been moving in, renting many modest
plots of land out from under tenant control, farming
it with efficient machinery and mass production tech
niques.

r state and federal governments have been stead
ily trying to combat the problem. lowa, for in
stance. has a law requiring that insurance companies,
banks, and corporations must sell their holdings within
two years after acquiring deeds of ownership on mort- !
gaged property.
But in spite of such measures the small farmer con
tinues to be cut ofT from his soil—and his living.
What can be done about the problem? Legislation
limiting the amount of land the landhog may farm
might help. Wide encouragement of a back-to-the
farm movement might prove to be one solution. Some
thing must be done, even at the price of the big farm
er's claim to individual initiative.
Otherwise, if the evil gets worse, the tenant farmer |
may bo forced into becoming a midwestern type of
"Okie." He then will not only be a relief problem, but
also a discontented factor of our population easily
subject to subversive philosophies, endangering fur
ther the demoeartic spirit of America.
