# Lincoln Fights Own Success In Tragic Play
## 
### 
"Abe Lincoln in Illinois," with
Raymond Massey, now playing at
the Curran Theater in San Fran
cisco.
"Old Abe Lincoln came out of the
wilderness,
Out of the wilderness, out of the
wilderness,
Old Abe Lincoln came out of the
wilderness,
Down in Illinois."
You'll realize the tragic truth in !
the words of Lincoln's campaign
song when you see Robert E. Sher
wood's "Abe Lincoln in Illinois." It's
the story of a man struggling against
his greatness and, in the end, being
licked by it.
FEELING OF DOOM
Don't misunderstand. Sherwood
isn't making his lines stand up and i
wave their arms, all the while cry- !
ing: "Get it? This is significant."
The feeling of doom and destiny is
just there. It comes to you from the
very first act when the young Lin
coln tells of his strange feeling in
the New Orleans crowds, and rends
Keats' "On Death."
There's really no point in saying
"Massey's Lincoln." Massey plain is
Lincoln. Big and awkward and
gangling, with a great kindness in
him, a shrewd wit, and a way with
men. Every word and gesture is
perfect.
KIRKLANI) WINS PRAISE
Muriel Kirkland, as Mary Todd,
was fine in her older scenes but
was, it seemed to me, a little too
mature for her younger ones. But
Mary Todd becomes tragic, too. Her
scene in the campaign headquar
ters shows perfectly the bitterness
and ambition of the woman. And
Lincoln's quiet "Damn you—damn
you." in answer, will live in your
memory as long as you've got one.
By this time, you must have the
idea that "Abe Lincoln in Illinois"
is a pretty superb play. The reasons
for this are three, I think. First a
happy combination of authors —
Sherwood and Lincoln collaborate in
this, and it's hard to tell where one
leaves off and the other begins; sec
ond, Raymond Massey heading an
excellent cast; and third, Joe Miel
ziner's sets which do much to give
the feeling for the times.—Nowell

and ambition of the woman. And
Lincoln's quiet "Damn you—damn
you." in answer, will live in your
memory as long as you've got one.
By this time, you must have the
idea that "Abe Lincoln in Illinois"
is a pretty superb play. The reasons
for this are three, I think. First a
happy combination of authors —
Sherwood and Lincoln collaborate in
this, and it's hard to tell where one
leaves off and the other begins; sec
ond, Raymond Massey heading an
excellent cast; and third, Joe Miel
ziner's sets which do much to give
the feeling for the times.—Nowell
"Abe Lincoln in Illinois," with
Raymond Massey, now playing at
the Curran Theater in San Fran
cisco.
"Old Abe Lincoln came out of the
wilderness,
Out of the wilderness, out of the
wilderness,
Old Abe Lincoln came out of the
wilderness,
Down in Illinois."
You'll realize the tragic truth in !
the words of Lincoln's campaign
song when you see Robert E. Sher
wood's "Abe Lincoln in Illinois." It's
the story of a man struggling against
his greatness and, in the end, being
licked by it.
FEELING OF DOOM
Don't misunderstand. Sherwood
isn't making his lines stand up and i
wave their arms, all the while cry- !
ing: "Get it? This is significant."
The feeling of doom and destiny is
just there. It comes to you from the
very first act when the young Lin
coln tells of his strange feeling in
the New Orleans crowds, and rends
Keats' "On Death."
There's really no point in saying
"Massey's Lincoln." Massey plain is
Lincoln. Big and awkward and
gangling, with a great kindness in
him, a shrewd wit, and a way with
men. Every word and gesture is
perfect.
KIRKLANI) WINS PRAISE
Muriel Kirkland, as Mary Todd,
was fine in her older scenes but
was, it seemed to me, a little too
mature for her younger ones. But
Mary Todd becomes tragic, too. Her
scene in the campaign headquar
ters shows perfectly the bitterness
and ambition of the woman. And
Lincoln's quiet "Damn you—damn
you." in answer, will live in your
memory as long as you've got one.
