### WILSON CANNON 
O nk man yesterday held intact j
the battered remnants of Prime
Minister Neville Chamberlain's con- '
servative English government.
The personal prestige of fiery i
Winston Churchill gave the Cham- j
berlain government a slim majority j
of 81 votes in a bitterly contested
vote of confidence. The majority j
was a new record low.
Churchill rallied to governmental I
defense in a dramatic right-about- |
face. At odds with the Chamberlain I
policies since their inception he I
accepted yesterday the "fullest re- |
sponsibility" (along with the rest of |
the Cabinet) for the Allied defeat in j
Norway.
Two days ago Chamberlain hand
ed Churchill the key position of
Britain's supreme war lord. Foreign
observers, noting this fact, hinted
that Churchill's saving move yes
terday came as an "exchange of
favors."
Opposition snipers continued
their attacks upon the present gov
ernment even after ar ouncc
ment of vote results. Aj <ry cries
of "resign, resign" continued to
resound among the great beams of
the House of Commons.
Laborites and liberals continued
their verbal attack upon Chamber
lain after, the closing of the session.
Pouring into the streets, they con
tinued their angry tirade . . .
promising that Chamberlain would
be ousted soon.
Even members of the Prime Min
ister's own conservative party pre
dicted that six or seven weeks is
the longest Chamberlain can remain
in office.
* * *
of the "inquest of a
nation" came from staunch
Winston Churchill himself. The
wily redhead has long been Eng
land's foremost proponent of sea
power.
Yesterday the House of Commons
listened aghast as he admitted that
(he superiority of the German air
fleet would continue "for some
time to come."
The land's new war lord hinted
that Allied fleet movements would
be hindered by Germany's much
vaunted Hying forces.
The question of "what are we go
ing to do about it" was not an
swered by Mr. Churchill. Official
sources, speaking unofficially, offered
two solutions:
1. Immediate purchase of foreign
built planes in an attempt to equal
the striking power of Germany's
air force. (English output cannot
equal the demand.)
2. Use of the Allied navy only
for lightning attack and troop
movements. Also as strong threat
to hinder too rash German air at
tacks.
Keynote of the anti-Chamberlain
campaign was sounded by hoary
David Lloyd George, head of Eng
land's government during World War
I. Lloyd George is perhaps the most,
bitter opponent of the Chamberlain
regime.
Vitriolic accusation is a dull de
scription of the Lloyd George at
tack.
* * *
r |MIE ex-Prime Minister gravely
warned that England's present
position is verging on the brink of
international disaster. It is his belief
that Germany may raid the British
Isles, and soon.
Reminiscing about his own World i
War experience, Lloyd George claim- !
cd that. England is in "greater jeop- j
ardy" now that at any time during !
his own wartime regime.
Swinging into an expose of the
recent Allied rout in Norway, he j
told the House (hat British prcs- I
(ige was battered by the sending i
of a "half-baked force" to the aid
of the little Scandinavian coun- j
try.
Amid roars of laughter, he warn
ed Winston Churchill not to let
himself be used as "an air raid
shelter for the rest of the cabinet."
Opposition members held sway
during most of the two-day attack
on the Chamberlain government.
This in spite of the slim victory re
corded yesterdav.
