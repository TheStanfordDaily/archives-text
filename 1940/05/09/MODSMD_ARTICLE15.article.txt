# 'Farmers' Rally to Work, Eat, Play for Convalescent Home
## 
### JERRY MAYER 
Twelve-hundred Stanford students trekked out to the Convalescent
Home yesterday to eat barlweued lamb and listen to some expected and
unexpected home-talent entertainment.
All classes were dismissed to allow Stanford!tes to spend the afternoon
hoeing and weeding the Convalescent Home grounds in their blue jeans

overalls.
After several hours of manual
labor, Indians grabbed paper plates,
filled them with beans, sandwiches,
cookies, ice cream, and meat and sat
themselves down on the ground to
bo entertained.
AUSTIN HYPNOTIZED
They saw and heard Dana Winters,
self-styled hypnotist, put Master of
Ceremonies Aubrey Austin in a
trance; Brad Young, Spring Show
vocalist, sing "Farewell My Tani,"
and Tray Galliano and Bob Rieser
play a pair of piano duets.
Thon following an old-fashioned
community sing, several staid mem
bers of Stanford's student executive
force took their turn on the rostrum.
MELLINKOFF SINGS
Demure Coline Upshaw led a
rousing chorus of "My Merry Olds
mobile" while Sherman Mellin√üoff,
Daily Bull-Sessioner and junior class
president, sang "Solidarity." Assist
ant Dean of Men Stanley Sharp ren
dered "Ach du lieber Augustine."
Larry Livingston, former editor of
The Daily, sang "Put on Your Old
Gray Bonnet" and "The Old Gray
Marc," and Harry Muheim climaxed
the program by reviving the hit
song of the Gaieties, "Top of Ihe
Libe."
A jolly-up in the Women's Gym
between 7 and 9 o'clock rounded out
Labor Day. Art McCue and his or
| chestra played.
