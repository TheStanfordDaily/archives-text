# Il Duce May State War Role Today
## Italian Press Hits Allies as Mussolini Maintains Silence 
### 
ROME, Thurs.. May 9 (UP).—
Premier Rcnito Mussolini was re
ported authoritatively to be ready
to break today his long silence on
Italy's role in a war-torn Europe
—a silence not shared by the Ital
ian press, which has been attack-,
ing the Allies freely.
Usually dependable quarters ex
pect Mussolini to speak about noon
from the balcony of Venice Palace,
and perhaps tell the Italian people
what he expects of them at this crit
ical moment. Today was the fourth
anniversary of the founding of the
Fascist empire.
The press achieved a new cres
cendo of invective against Britain
and France. Obviously inspired in
its unanimity, it clamored against
the Allies with the accusation they
were planning an early coup in the
Mediterranean, Balkans or Near
East.
Leading the outburst of denuncia
tion was a warning by the authori
tative editor, Virginio Gayda, against
any attempt to blockade the Medi
teiTanean. Such an effort to bottle
up Italy might plunge the Allies into
a new phase of a "hard, uncertain,
bloody war," he said.
PRESS HITS ALLIES
Mussolini's own newspaper, Popolo
D'ltalia of Milan, slammed the door
against any French overtures toward
Italy. It said the advances came too
late, and then only because of the
Allied setback in Scandinavia.
"On March 26, 1939, Mussolini told
Fascist shock troops that 'the French
government is at perfect liberty to
refuse to discuss Italy's territorial
claims, but she would not grieve if
the misunderstanding which divides
the two countries becomes so deep
that it will be arduous if not im
possible to bridge it,' " the newspa
per said.
"Today, as II Duce warned, the
misunderstanding has grown into an
abyss. France has come too late."
PRE-BELLIGERENCY
A new word describing Italy's po
sition cropped up in the Senate to
day when Senator Maurizio Mara
viglia said:
"As far as the feelings of the Ital
ian people are concerned, perhaps
it. would be more correct to say that
Italy considers herself in a state of
pre-belligerency. By this we mean
Italy is not disposed to pay for the
benefits of peace with any sacrifice
of her interests and aspirations, and
therefore Italy is firmly decided to
prepare for any eventuality."
FATAL ERROR'
Writing in the Giornale D'ltalia,
Gayda said the Allies were making
a "fatal error" if they thought they
could intimidate Italy because they
control Gibraltar and Suez.
Even if the closing of the Suez
Canal and the Strait of Gibraltar
should bottle up this nation, should
Italy enter the war on the side of
Germany, Gayda claimed that ample
supplies would be available by other
routes. He obsei'ved that in such a
case Italy vvould receive many
products from the Balkans.

ROME, Thurs.. May 9 (UP).—
Premier Rcnito Mussolini was re
ported authoritatively to be ready
to break today his long silence on
Italy's role in a war-torn Europe
—a silence not shared by the Ital
ian press, which has been attack-,
ing the Allies freely.
Usually dependable quarters ex
pect Mussolini to speak about noon
from the balcony of Venice Palace,
and perhaps tell the Italian people
what he expects of them at this crit
ical moment. Today was the fourth
anniversary of the founding of the
Fascist empire.
The press achieved a new cres
cendo of invective against Britain
and France. Obviously inspired in
its unanimity, it clamored against
the Allies with the accusation they
were planning an early coup in the
Mediterranean, Balkans or Near
East.
Leading the outburst of denuncia
tion was a warning by the authori
tative editor, Virginio Gayda, against
any attempt to blockade the Medi
teiTanean. Such an effort to bottle
up Italy might plunge the Allies into
a new phase of a "hard, uncertain,
bloody war," he said.
PRESS HITS ALLIES
Mussolini's own newspaper, Popolo
D'ltalia of Milan, slammed the door
against any French overtures toward
Italy. It said the advances came too
late, and then only because of the
Allied setback in Scandinavia.
"On March 26, 1939, Mussolini told
Fascist shock troops that 'the French
government is at perfect liberty to
refuse to discuss Italy's territorial
claims, but she would not grieve if
the misunderstanding which divides
the two countries becomes so deep
that it will be arduous if not im
possible to bridge it,' " the newspa
per said.
"Today, as II Duce warned, the
misunderstanding has grown into an
abyss. France has come too late."
PRE-BELLIGERENCY
A new word describing Italy's po
sition cropped up in the Senate to
day when Senator Maurizio Mara
viglia said:
"As far as the feelings of the Ital
ian people are concerned, perhaps
it. would be more correct to say that
Italy considers herself in a state of
pre-belligerency. By this we mean
Italy is not disposed to pay for the
benefits of peace with any sacrifice
of her interests and aspirations, and
therefore Italy is firmly decided to
prepare for any eventuality."
FATAL ERROR'
Writing in the Giornale D'ltalia,
Gayda said the Allies were making
a "fatal error" if they thought they
could intimidate Italy because they
control Gibraltar and Suez.
Even if the closing of the Suez
Canal and the Strait of Gibraltar
should bottle up this nation, should
Italy enter the war on the side of
Germany, Gayda claimed that ample
supplies would be available by other
routes. He obsei'ved that in such a
case Italy vvould receive many
products from the Balkans.
