# NAVAJOS MAKE RAIN MEDICINE
## 
### 

THESE NAVAIIO INDIANS from Cameron, Ariz., reservation, hit by a seven-year drouth, took time out
from a Hollywood job to invoke the rain god Ilinhin, in a ceremony on Santa Monica beach. They hope to
make "biff medicine" by taking a bottle of sea water back to Arizona.
