# Farm Faculty Members Predict Allied Victory, Stalemate in World War II
## 
### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
Adolf Hitler, after Nazi victories
in Norway, has predicted that the
war will soon end with a glorious
victory for the Ileich. liut live
Stanford professors, 7000 miles
from the battlefields, do not agree
with Herr Hitler.
Professors Edwin A. Cottrell, Al
bert Guerard, Merrill T. Spalding,
George F. Sensabaugh and Graham
Stuart were asked yesterday, "What
do you think will be the ultimate re
sult of World War II?" Three of the
professors believe that the Allies
will win, two are of the opinion the
war will end in a stalemate.
Dr. Cottrell, executive head of the
Department of Political Science, re
plied, "The ultimate result of World
War II is much less predictable than
that of I.
"Isolation is less secure. The
United States faces problems on two
fronts rather than being merely a
friend and aid to its European allies.
Holland invaded means the United
States protects its commercial inter
ests in the Dutch West Indies, and
England's interests in the Far East.
"Ultimately the whole German
war machine will collapse from
lack of friends and economic star
vation. The United States will
contribute to that collapse with re
sources, money, and credit, but
not with military force," Dr. Cot
trell concluded.
Dr. Merrill T. Spalding, assistant
professor of history and research as
sociate, Russian Revolution Institute
(Hoover Library), said:
"Seems to me that on the basis of
experience of the last war, this will
be a long and exhaustive war. Ger
many had a number of successes at

first, but gradually the Allies built |
up an efficient military machine—
and won. Now it looks as if the same
thing will happen in this war, un- i
less military strategy and tactics j
have been so greatly changed by j
new strength of air forces to permit I
the Germans to win a rapid, decisive j
victory. Otherwise, the Allies will
win.
"Securing of credit will be the
chief method used by the Allies,
within a year or two, to break
down United States neutrality. I
doubt that we will send our arm
ies abroad, but the American peo
ple might be won over to giving
economic aid and sending our
naval and air forces."
Dr. Guerard, professor of Eng- I
lish. answered: "On the present
basis—with Germany, France, and
England what they are—neither side
can win. This implies that the pres
ent regimes cannot make peace.
Italy's entrance depends upon
whether she is frightened enough or
sure enough.
"Supposing the United States be
lieves in the same thing as England :
and France — democracy and capi- i
talism—we would be foolish to al
low them to be crushed. If the war
is on. this basis, they are defending
our interests — underlining the 'if.' j
Are we going to do what Sweden
and Norway did to Finland and
what England and France did to
Spain?"
Dr. George F. Sensabaugh, Eng- j
lish professor, who was present in J
Europe during the Munich crisis, '
said: * j
"I feel inclined to twist ex-Presi- !
dent Hoover's statement, 'Unless the j
war stops soon, it will be a long J
war,' to this: 'Unless someone wins !

soon, no one will win.' And the war j
will not, as I see it, stop soon.
"If Russia stands by and watches j
the western powers cut each others' ;
throats, eventually even a blood j
transfusion from the United States
would be unable to revive western
civilization as we now know it, and
Europe, including Nazi, Fascist, and
democratic powers, would fall be
fore the new Russian imperialism.
'Japan would move next, and
this country would wag the big stick
in the East until some gestures would j
have to be backed up with guns.
By this time Eskimos, Bushmen, and I
Pygmies would be about the only J
people not. actively involved."
'NEUTRALS REAL VICTORS'
Dr. Graham Stuart, political sci
ence professor, stated:
"Such a query can only be an
swered satisfactorily by a Cumaean
sybil or Delphic oracle, and then
the interpretations would vary. It is
a reasonable assumption that the
nations which are able to remain
neutral will be the real victors, but
from present indications there will ;
be few neutrals left in Europe.
"In spite of the fiasco in Norway I j
feel that the British and French will
be the ultimate victors because in a }
war of attrition they have the great
er resources. I do not believe that
any 'blitzkrieg' >vi 11 conquer the Al- j
lied Empires.
"Italy will probably suffer most if j
she enters the war, which will be a |
fitting outcome to her policy of op- j
portunistic aggression. I do not ex- J
pect the United States to become a
belligerent in the war, so long as it
is confined to Europe, but we may j
revise our neutrality laws to per
mit the sale of military supplies on
a credit basis."

many had a number of successes at

first, but gradually the Allies built |
up an efficient military machine—

less military strategy and tactics j

the Germans to win a rapid, decisive j

'NEUTRALS REAL VICTORS'
Dr. Graham Stuart, political sci

swered satisfactorily by a Cumaean
sybil or Delphic oracle, and then
the interpretations would vary. It is
a reasonable assumption that the
nations which are able to remain

Professors Edwin A. Cottrell, Al
bert Guerard, Merrill T. Spalding,
George F. Sensabaugh and Graham
Stuart were asked yesterday, "What
do you think will be the ultimate re
sult of World War II?" Three of the
professors believe that the Allies
will win, two are of the opinion the
war will end in a stalemate.
Dr. Cottrell, executive head of the
Department of Political Science, re
plied, "The ultimate result of World
War II is much less predictable than
that of I.
"Isolation is less secure. The
United States faces problems on two
fronts rather than being merely a
friend and aid to its European allies.
Holland invaded means the United
States protects its commercial inter
ests in the Dutch West Indies, and
England's interests in the Far East.
"Ultimately the whole German
war machine will collapse from
lack of friends and economic star
vation. The United States will
contribute to that collapse with re
sources, money, and credit, but
not with military force," Dr. Cot
trell concluded.
Dr. Merrill T. Spalding, assistant
professor of history and research as
sociate, Russian Revolution Institute
(Hoover Library), said:
"Seems to me that on the basis of
experience of the last war, this will
be a long and exhaustive war. Ger
many had a number of successes at

first, but gradually the Allies built |
up an efficient military machine—

thing will happen in this war, un- i
less military strategy and tactics j
have been so greatly changed by j
new strength of air forces to permit I
the Germans to win a rapid, decisive j
victory. Otherwise, the Allies will
win.
"Securing of credit will be the
chief method used by the Allies,
within a year or two, to break
down United States neutrality. I
