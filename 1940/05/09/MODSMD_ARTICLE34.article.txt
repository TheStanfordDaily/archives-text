We arc always hearing tales about
the brand of officiating turned out
by so-called officials in Southern
California after a Northern team
has played the Trojans or Bruins in
Los Angeles.
No matter what the sport, most
Northern California teams hate to
go South because they always fig
ure that the olliicals in Los Angeles
are either pro Troian or Bruin and
that the visiting team won't get
any breaks from the whistle
tooters.
We've heard tales of the notorious
ly "slow" dockers when Stanford
goes south to meet the Trojans in
the Coliseum, and we've heard about
the rough riding the locals get when
they get into a basketball game with
Southern California in particular.
Recently we've heard about umpires
in baseball games giving all the
close decisions to the home town
nine.
IN A LETTER written to the
sports editor of The Daily Trojan,
a former baseball player commented
that perhaps the reason the Trojans
went into a tailspin in their recent
Northern California tour was be
cause officiating in the Bay was a
little fairer than that at Bovard
Field.
In writing this fellow says, "We
knew that when we played in Los
Angeles that every play had to be
a clear-cut advantage for lis or
else we didn't have a chance. We
realized that no Northern school
gets any breaks in close decision
in games' played on Bovard Field."
To which Sports Editor Jack Gil
lean agrees that the former baseball
players has something there, because
he knows that the Trojan baseballers
couldn't have won two games from
Cal, and one each from Stanford,
Santa Clara, and St. Mary's because
of heads-up play alone.
»;« >|t *
A CHOICE STORY floated up a
couple of days after the Trojan-
Olympic Club-Bruin triangle meet
in Los Angeles, April 27, the week
Ijefore we met defeat.
Johnny Wilson, who eventually
was given a tie for first at (» feet
!) :l ,x inches with Les Steers of the
Winged is supposed to have
made that height with the help of
Trojan managers who kept the bar
from falling oil' the standards after
Wilson had brushed it on his
attempt.
The managers' excuse would be
that it wasn't brushed enough to
fall off, but some claim that they've
never seen a bar bent so in the
middle and still stay on.
TROJAN BASKETBALLERS have
to play two different brands of ball
every year. One is the kind they play
in Los Angeles where they can get
away with mayhem, and the other
is the kind we play in the Bay
where Lloyd Leith and Ernie Bailey
won't let any team get away with
violating the rules.
The Stanfords had a rough time
in Los Angeles in their first two
game series, and when they came
back they were in pretty had shape
after the Troians had made things
pretty rough for them.
But when the Leith-Bailey com
bination forced the Trojans to tone
down their floor tactics, the Indians
were able to cop one of the games.
Even California was able to take one
of their northern games from El
Troje.

are either pro Troian or Bruin and
that the visiting team won't get
any breaks from the whistle
tooters.
We've heard tales of the notorious
ly "slow" dockers when Stanford
goes south to meet the Trojans in
the Coliseum, and we've heard about
the rough riding the locals get when
they get into a basketball game with
Southern California in particular.
Recently we've heard about umpires
in baseball games giving all the
close decisions to the home town
nine.
IN A LETTER written to the
sports editor of The Daily Trojan,
a former baseball player commented
that perhaps the reason the Trojans
went into a tailspin in their recent
Northern California tour was be
cause officiating in the Bay was a
little fairer than that at Bovard
Field.
In writing this fellow says, "We
knew that when we played in Los
Angeles that every play had to be
a clear-cut advantage for lis or
else we didn't have a chance. We
realized that no Northern school
gets any breaks in close decision
in games' played on Bovard Field."
To which Sports Editor Jack Gil
lean agrees that the former baseball
players has something there, because
he knows that the Trojan baseballers
couldn't have won two games from
Cal, and one each from Stanford,
Santa Clara, and St. Mary's because
of heads-up play alone.

A CHOICE STORY floated up a
couple of days after the Trojan-
Olympic Club-Bruin triangle meet
in Los Angeles, April 27, the week
Ijefore we met defeat.
Johnny Wilson, who eventually
was given a tie for first at (» feet
!) :l ,x inches with Les Steers of the
Winged is supposed to have
made that height with the help of
Trojan managers who kept the bar
from falling oil' the standards after
Wilson had brushed it on his
attempt.
The managers' excuse would be
that it wasn't brushed enough to
fall off, but some claim that they've
never seen a bar bent so in the
middle and still stay on.
TROJAN BASKETBALLERS have
to play two different brands of ball
every year. One is the kind they play
in Los Angeles where they can get
away with mayhem, and the other
is the kind we play in the Bay
where Lloyd Leith and Ernie Bailey
won't let any team get away with
violating the rules.
The Stanfords had a rough time
in Los Angeles in their first two
game series, and when they came
back they were in pretty had shape
after the Troians had made things
pretty rough for them.
But when the Leith-Bailey com
bination forced the Trojans to tone
down their floor tactics, the Indians
were able to cop one of the games.
Even California was able to take one
of their northern games from El
Troje.
We arc always hearing tales about
the brand of officiating turned out
by so-called officials in Southern
California after a Northern team
has played the Trojans or Bruins in
Los Angeles.
No matter what the sport, most
Northern California teams hate to
go South because they always fig
ure that the olliicals in Los Angeles
are either pro Troian or Bruin and
that the visiting team won't get
any breaks from the whistle
tooters.
