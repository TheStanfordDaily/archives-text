# Lew Jenkins Set For Friday Bout

### 
GREENWOOD LAKE, N.Y., May
8 (UP). — This Lakeside (raining
camp was thrown into a dither to
night when Lightweight Challenger
Lew Jenkins suddenly moved into
New York City so he can "break-in
a bed" before Friday's title light
with Champion Lou Ambers.
"Beds is like hosses." said the lean,
gaunt-faced Texan. "They gotta be
broke-in before you kin depend on
'em. I ain't takin" no chances on
sleeping in a strange bed tomorrow
night—the night before the fight."'
The challenger was perturbed
about his bed, but not about the
fight. He said he was "in the pink,"
physically and mentally, after a
month of conditioning here in the
mountains, during which he boxed
80 rounds.
Jenkins concluded his Greenwood
activities with a brief limbering
workout at Joe Murchio's gymna
sium. He scaled 134 pounds, just one
under the lightweight limit.
