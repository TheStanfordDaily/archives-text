# Half-mile Sprint Team Preps to Smash World's Record at Fresno Relays
## 
### 
Chances are that the next world record Stanford's track team breaks
will he the four-man half-mile relay mark. Yesterday a Cardinal team
composed of Charlie Shaw. Don lYlcFailand. Ken Battaglia, and Captain
Clyde Jeffrey gave notice that they have the potentialities to break the
existing record.
This quarter whipped through an KBO in 1:25.3 without any competition.
'I his time is only three-tenths of a second slower than the world mark

by a Stanford team consisting \
of Jim Kneubuhl, Ray Malott, Stan
Hiserman, and Jack Weiershauser
and set in the 1937 Fresno Relays.
There is every indication that with
competition the present Indian
quartet will go out and, with a bat
tery of swift U.S.C. sprinters at their
elbows, break the old mark.
Two other Stanford sprinters gave
Coach Bill Ellington reason to smile j

j yesterday in practice. They were
Les Johnson and Johnny Grant who 1
ran their approximately fastest bun- i
dred-yard dashejj. Les and Johnny \
j each ran their centuries in times
that split 9.8 and 9.9.
CARDS SEEK REVENGE
The other performances by the
Cud sprinters and distance men
1 throughout the week indicate that
) Jeffrey and Co. are ready to take
full advantage of their first chance
of revenge against U.S.C. for that
dual meet beating they had to take.
But in the field events things aren't 1
as bright.
Stan Andersen, suffering from a
back injury, will probably not be j
able to compete in the relays. And
"Big Meet Hero" Bob Stone is both
ered by a sore arm and won't bs
at his best in the javelin.
FIELD EVENTS IMPROVE
Except for these sure 13 points for I
the Cards which have now become
doubtful quantities, the Indians
ought to continue their improvement
in the field events.
Ray Brown, who leaped over 24 ;
feet against the Trojans, is now j
ready to challenge U.C.L.A.'s mighty j
trio of broad jumpers. And if Russ i
Wulff and Jim Lincoln continue
their hot streak and again jump
around 6 feet 5 inches they are
jbound to get more than two-fifths of
t point which was all they earned
jgainst mighty El Trojan.
Bill Trout has the stuff to take I

There is every indication that with
competition the present Indian
quartet will go out and, with a bat
tery of swift U.S.C. sprinters at their
elbows, break the old mark.
Two other Stanford sprinters gave
Coach Bill Ellington reason to smile j

j yesterday in practice. They were
Les Johnson and Johnny Grant who 1
ran their approximately fastest bun- i

that split 9.8 and 9.9.
CARDS SEEK REVENGE
The other performances by the
Cud sprinters and distance men
1 throughout the week indicate that
) Jeffrey and Co. are ready to take
full advantage of their first chance
of revenge against U.S.C. for that
dual meet beating they had to take.
But in the field events things aren't 1
as bright.
Stan Andersen, suffering from a
back injury, will probably not be j
able to compete in the relays. And
"Big Meet Hero" Bob Stone is both
ered by a sore arm and won't bs
at his best in the javelin.
FIELD EVENTS IMPROVE
Except for these sure 13 points for I
the Cards which have now become
doubtful quantities, the Indians
ought to continue their improvement
in the field events.
Ray Brown, who leaped over 24 ;
feet against the Trojans, is now j
ready to challenge U.C.L.A.'s mighty j
trio of broad jumpers. And if Russ i
Wulff and Jim Lincoln continue
their hot streak and again jump
around 6 feet 5 inches they are
jbound to get more than two-fifths of
t point which was all they earned
jgainst mighty El Trojan.
Bill Trout has the stuff to take I

1 feet and to make it official this I

Chances are that the next world record Stanford's track team breaks
will he the four-man half-mile relay mark. Yesterday a Cardinal team

existing record.
This quarter whipped through an KBO in 1:25.3 without any competition.
