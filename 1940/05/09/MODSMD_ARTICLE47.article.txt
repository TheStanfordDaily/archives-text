# Gridders Join Drive Workers After Practice
## 
### 
In deference to (lie Convales
cent Home program. Coach Clark
Shaughnessy moved grid practice
up a couple of hours yesterday,
working the squad from 1:45
o clock to 3:45 so his huskies could
over and chop wood for the
kiddies. The Indians will go hack
on the regular schedule this af
tci noou in another secret prac
tice.
Pete Kmetovic was the fair
h.tiled hid in yesterday's scrum.
The speedy halfback is a tough man
to knock off his pins, as he proved
with several sprints through the
fourth string. Left-guard Johnny
Kerman looked good in the first
team line.
The second string forward -wall at
present consists of six freshmen
and Jim Verdieck. Verdieek, after a
brief trial in the backfield, is back
at his old center spot, but now finds
that he'll have to beat out Doug
Stable for the first string post.
In addition to Verdieck, freshmen
Ed Stamm and Hank Norberg at
ends, Bruno Banducci and Bob
Millington at tackles, and Ed Mc-
Kain and Jack Mac Donald tit guards
performed on the second team line.
Johnny Sturgeon, hard-blocking
halfback, has been watching prac
tice on crutches from the sidelines
this week. Sturgeon is suffering
from a badly mangled left knee that
will probably keep him out of the
remaining spring drills.
