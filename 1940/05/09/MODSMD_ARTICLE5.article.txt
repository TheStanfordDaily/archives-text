### United Press 
LONDON — Chamberlain and
cabinet survive hardest battle for
their political life by narrow ma
jority of 81 votes of confidence
after two-day debate on conduct
of war, punctuated by demands
Chamberlain resign to prevent a
German victory; Churchill accepts
"full responsibility" with Cham
berlain, and his rally to the sup
port of the Prime Minister may
have saved Chamberlain from
going down.
AMSTERDAM—HoIIand main
tains readiness to resist invasion
despite assurances from the bel
ligerents; tension decreases, how
ever, and danger to Lowlands is
thought lessened.
ROME—ltaly warns any attempt
to blockade the Mediterranean
might plunge the Allies into a new
phase of a "hard, uncertain, bloody
war"; Mussolini may break silence
on Italy's war intentions in speech
Thursday.
