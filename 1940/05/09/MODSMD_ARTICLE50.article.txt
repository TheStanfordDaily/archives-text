# Wolf! Wolf!

XJT.Kh il is spring ({iiartcr and the freshmen are
still at it—turning in false alarms. This crying
<>| "wolf in Kneina presents one of the most serious
problems which the I Diversity has to face in con
nection with the freshman hall.
Il is llit* only hall in the I ni\ersit\ whose alarm
s\stein is not connected with the firehouse itself.
I oyon. Ihanner, and Sequoia all have alarms run
ning direct In to the station. Hut in Kneina it is
necessary for someone to run to a telephone and
call the (irchouse after he finds out uhelher or not
il is a real fire.
After the first fcNv Nveeks of being rudely awak
ened in the middle of the nighl. often not just once
but In\o or three times, the freshmen learn to take
no heed ol the warning bell and sleep blissfully on.
If a fire were lo occur. Kneina would burn fast,
aided b\ the three wells which would act as chim
i'cn s for llic llames. And not only would the lire
alarm tail to nn;il\c the sleeping occupants but il
would ring oiiln in the hall, forcing the night watch
man to call the fire station on the phone—a waste
of precious time.
I here i- certainly no reason why men in collegc
cannot understand and use properly something
Nvhich has been installed for their own safety yet
which, through their silliness. tlicN render absolutely
useless as a safet) device.
I'erhaps strong action should be taken I>\ the Ad
ministration against the oflcnders. but il would be
belter for action l<> come from within I lie freshman
class itself. Whether il be in the form of action by
Ihe sponsors within the hall or whether il would
be in the form of a vigilante group among the firsl-
Near men. i~ something which will have to be worked
oul. I hit some sort of direct action is needed to
icnioNc Ihe fire hazard.
Ihe cr\ of nn olf. nn olf is one of the oldest and
llie deadliest, lis omen should not lall over Stanford.*
