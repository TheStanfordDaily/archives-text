## SATURDAY PROBLEM 
### 
r PHE EDITOR, SIR:
I'm not trying to Â«ct basic or at all filthy, but
with regard to (his housemother question, I wish to
broach one question. If the fraternities had house
mothers, what would they do about the toilet facilities?
The cost of installing another bathroom would be in
surmountable. Or maybe the administration is willing
to pay the bills. I also hear that the earth is flat.
Worried
