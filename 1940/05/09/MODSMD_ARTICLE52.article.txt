r rilE EDITOR, SIR:
The splendid success of the past week's activities
undertaken by Stanford's students for the benefit of
the Stanford Convalescent Home fills me with pride
m the student body. On behalf of the Board of Direc
tors and the Convalescent Home, I desire through

your columns to thank the Stanford students for their
willing and unselfish efforts, culminating in Labor
Day, which I personally attended and thoroughly
enjoyed.
I wish especially to express our thanks to Ned
Pugh, chairman of the Convalescent Home Drive
committee, and to his 23 co-workers: Bob Beckham,
Dick Frank, Sue Hyman, Graham Barbey, Frank
Knowles, Greyson Bryan, Barbara Bassett, John All
tucker, Bob Breckner, Charlotte Rush, Ruthelen List,
Bill Turner, Rosamond Upson, Pete Whittlesey, Mary
Kay Horton, Jack Showalter, Marjorie Tight, Bob Ein
stein, Charles Black, Jerry Mayer, George Concan
non, and Ray Durham.
Finally, to The Stanford Daily, for consistently
helpful publicity, the results of which speak for
themselves, we are deeply grateful. I have followed
The Daily with great interest and have noted your
constructive emphasis on the idea of the Stanford
Family working togetherâ€”students, trustees, faculty
and alumni. The Convalescent Home Drive is a dem
onstration of the worth of that idea of united effort.
Stanford's problems can be solved if we have the un
derstanding of all branches of the Stanford Family,
and I want to assure you that the evidence given
through the share of responsibility for the future wel
fare of Stanford is a source of satisfaction to other
branches of the Family in facing their responsibilities.
With our sincere gratitude,
Ira S. Lillick, President,
Stanford Convalescent Home
