## HITLER BEWARE!

jyfRS. WIGGS of the Cabbage Patch—all who were
sentimental children will remember her—had a
belligerent daughter named "Asia." And whenever
things went badly for Asia she would hurl a devas
tating threat: "I'll hold my breath," she would an
nounce. "I'll hold my breath until you do as I say."
As one may well imagine, this threat of Asia's
simply terrorized her antagonists. They immediately
capitulated to the five-year-old's demands. What else
could they do? If they refused to listen to reason,
Asia would hold her breath.
But little did Asia suspect that presumably intel
ligent adults would copy her technique in the field of
world politics. Little did Asia suspect that an army of
"moral re-armers" would combat steeled and gun
powdered belligerence with a force as idle as holding
one's breath.
Like five-year-old Asia, the Moral Rearmament
movement is undoubtedly beset with fine intentions.
Most of the world seems to have gone mad; war and
tyranny seem almost uncontrollable. And it is com
mendable that in such a world the moral reai'mers
should be disgusted by the might-makes-right re
gime, and to feel devoutly for the losing cause of
peace.

B UT if world peace depended solely on holding the
right thought, on strengthening our individual
"spirits," then the millennium would have long ago
arrived. Buddha, Mohammet, Moses, and Christ preach
ed the doctrine of brotherly love. And some day their
prophecies may be fulfilled. Some day we may have
"peace on earth, good will toward men." But the mere
age of such philosophies should give moral rearmers
a hint as to where they are not going very fast.
Whether Moral Rearmament would have it so or
not, the great forces of economics and politics, and
their changeling child militarism, are shaping the
ugly form of history that Moral Rearmament decries.
And it is only by directing those forces toward peace
and democracy that any morality whatever can en
dure in the world of force.
It certainly does not appear likely that Hitler and
Churchill will sign a truce and let a covey of doves
wing its way over the battlefields of Europe simply
because people believe in that old abstraction, moral
rearmament. It is hard to see the German army and
the British fleet dropping their arms for a game of
bridge simply because people have armed themselves
with "morals."
Now it may be true that statesmen have as little
chance to legislate the economic and political pre
requisites of peace as moral rearmers have of bringing
an everlasting armistice with words. But that does
not prove the wisdom of following George Bernard
Shaw's sarcastic advice, "If you can't have what you
believe in, then believe in what you have."
