September 28th, the Stanford football
k team opens its 1940 football season, meeting the
strong University of San Francisco eleven at Kezar
Stadium and each Saturday except one, for the fol
lowing nine weeks will tackle another strong Pacific
Coast team, including Santa Clara, Southern California,
U.C.L.A., Oregon, Oregon State, Washington, Wash
ington State, concluding with the Big Game at Ber
keley.
It is with this in mind that the coaching staff and
the football squad here at Stanford have been work
ing for the past month in spring practice. The squad
will be called together again on September 12th, which
allows us about, fourteen days' practice before this
opening game. So it is during these spring drills that
the bulk of the preparatory work must be done. We
of the coaching staff, must acquaint ourselves with
the players who will be eligible to participate next
fall, attempting to learn the strong and weak points of
each man. We realize that with the change in system
and the large number of new men we must accomplish
as much as is possible in laying the ground work for
fall in these spring drills.
» * • *
is our hope that the squad will master the basis
of the offensive and defensive football that we will
use next fall and we will attempt to develop it as far
as possible in the limited time allotted to spring foot
ball. Included in this spring work are extensive drills
in the fundamentals of blocking and tackling, which
are so necessary if we are to have any success in our
fall schedule. We feel that good habits of tackling
and blocking must be established by every player
and the time to develop these habits is during spring
practice.
In a sense, spring football practice is an insurance
for the competitor. Athletic injuries diminish with
experience. The training and experience that football
men acquire during the spring will help them to avoid
injuries that may handicap them during the fall.
In the short time that we have working to
gether it is impossible to give any accurate informa
tion 5s to our fall prospects other than to say that we
have been well pleased with the response and interest
of squad members. They have shown a fine attitude
toward their work and a continuation of this should
lend to the development of a fine team spirit.
It is our hope that you members of the Stanford
student body will continue your interest in the football
team, keeping in mind that it is your team and that
the players are representing you on the field. We
value this school spirit and feel that it is a definite
asset toward the success of any college athletic team.

Stadium and each Saturday except one, for the fol

Coast team, including Santa Clara, Southern California,

It is with this in mind that the coaching staff and
the football squad here at Stanford have been work
ing for the past month in spring practice. The squad
will be called together again on September 12th, which
allows us about, fourteen days' practice before this
opening game. So it is during these spring drills that
the bulk of the preparatory work must be done. We
of the coaching staff, must acquaint ourselves with
the players who will be eligible to participate next
fall, attempting to learn the strong and weak points of
each man. We realize that with the change in system
and the large number of new men we must accomplish
as much as is possible in laying the ground work for
fall in these spring drills.

is our hope that the squad will master the basis
of the offensive and defensive football that we will
use next fall and we will attempt to develop it as far
as possible in the limited time allotted to spring foot
ball. Included in this spring work are extensive drills
in the fundamentals of blocking and tackling, which
are so necessary if we are to have any success in our
fall schedule. We feel that good habits of tackling
and blocking must be established by every player
and the time to develop these habits is during spring
practice.
In a sense, spring football practice is an insurance
for the competitor. Athletic injuries diminish with
experience. The training and experience that football
men acquire during the spring will help them to avoid
injuries that may handicap them during the fall.
In the short time that we have working to
gether it is impossible to give any accurate informa
tion 5s to our fall prospects other than to say that we
have been well pleased with the response and interest
of squad members. They have shown a fine attitude
toward their work and a continuation of this should
lend to the development of a fine team spirit.
It is our hope that you members of the Stanford
student body will continue your interest in the football
team, keeping in mind that it is your team and that
the players are representing you on the field. We
value this school spirit and feel that it is a definite
asset toward the success of any college athletic team.
