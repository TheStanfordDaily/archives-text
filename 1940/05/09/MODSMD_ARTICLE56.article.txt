# Muni's Talent Highlights Murky 'Key Largo' Plot
## 
### 
"KEY LARGO," Maxwell AndersAt's verse drama, with Paul Muni,
now playing at the Geary Theater in Sin Francisco.
If you are considering a trek to thdCity to see "Key Largo" don't get
set for a well-put-together, fast talkit. and acting play. You won't get
it: but you will get some excellent philoophv. perfectly acted by Paul Muni.

The play is put together strangely,
and this, I think, is responsible for
the lag in the middle. There is a
long prologue which states the ques
tion, i.e., whether or not it is better
to die for an ideal of freedom and
justice even though the cause is lost.
LEADS LOYALISTS
In this case, King McCloud is the
leader of five Loyalist volunteers
in Spain. They know the cause is
lost, and that they will be assigned
to cover a suicidal retreat. All but
McCloud choose to die.
Then, in the first act, the thing
becomes nearly static. McCloud
turns up in Key Largo, Florida,
where the father and sister of one
of his comrades live. He is hounded
by his conscience, and hopes to dis
cover, through them, some justifica
tion for his act.
LITTLE HAPPENS
In Key Largo he finds a miniatu)
edition of the Spanish issues. A
through this act Anderson simply ex
plains what has happened, and hf/
it has affected the various chan
ters. Much is indicated, but li,ie
happens.
However, you can't ask for
thing better than the second act«ln
it. McCloud realizes that that *al
demands death; because life J a
compromise isn't worth living.
Without Muni, it'd be no phi' It
takes an actor to hold a stage 3 by
himself for nearly half an houii'ith
one very brief interruption. Gtfted
there's plenty of stuff in whaKn
derson has to say. But few 'tors
have the ability to say it.—Ncjill

"KEY LARGO," Maxwell AndersAt's verse drama, with Paul Muni,
now playing at the Geary Theater in Sin Francisco.
If you are considering a trek to thdCity to see "Key Largo" don't get
set for a well-put-together, fast talkit. and acting play. You won't get
it: but you will get some excellent philoophv. perfectly acted by Paul Muni.

The play is put together strangely,
and this, I think, is responsible for
the lag in the middle. There is a
long prologue which states the ques
tion, i.e., whether or not it is better
to die for an ideal of freedom and
justice even though the cause is lost.
LEADS LOYALISTS
In this case, King McCloud is the
leader of five Loyalist volunteers
in Spain. They know the cause is
lost, and that they will be assigned
to cover a suicidal retreat. All but
McCloud choose to die.
Then, in the first act, the thing
becomes nearly static. McCloud
turns up in Key Largo, Florida,
where the father and sister of one
of his comrades live. He is hounded
by his conscience, and hopes to dis
cover, through them, some justifica
tion for his act.
LITTLE HAPPENS
In Key Largo he finds a miniatu)
edition of the Spanish issues. A
through this act Anderson simply ex
plains what has happened, and hf/
it has affected the various chan
ters. Much is indicated, but li,ie
happens.
However, you can't ask for
thing better than the second act«ln
it. McCloud realizes that that *al
demands death; because life J a
compromise isn't worth living.
Without Muni, it'd be no phi' It
takes an actor to hold a stage 3 by
himself for nearly half an houii'ith
one very brief interruption. Gtfted
there's plenty of stuff in whaKn
derson has to say. But few 'tors
have the ability to say it.—Ncjill
