'pnUST Benito Mussolini to learn
an object lesson well.
The Italian dictator has few peers
when it comes to international poli
tics. He, as well as the rest of Eu
rope, has been absorbing the "what
not to do" story of Neville Chamber
lain.
Yesterday, on the fourth anniver
sary of Fascism in Italy, II Duce
showed the world what he had
learned. His blue book will probably
come back from the corrector with
an "A" on the cover.
Boiled down to a few words, the
Mussolini dogma was, in effect:
"Keep fooling the people."
Saluting and gyrating in the
typical Duce manner, Mussolini
fed a cheering crowd a heaping
dish of propaganda guaranteed to
stiffen Italian spines and prepare
their owners for possible entry
into World War 11.
The text of his speech, and the
tone of the crowd, was strongly pro-
German.
"I will act, not talk," Mussolini
told an estimated crowd of 75,000
from the balcony of his Venice pal
ace. "As for the past month, you
must get accustomed to my silence."
As for the past four years, II Duce
spoke for hours . . . said nothing
definite about Italy's part in the
critical international situation.

J>ACKED people in Venice square
roared when II Duce appeared,
expecting some vital statement. He
gave no hint of expected develop
ments. His official press, however,
did.
For the past week the Italian pa
pers, especially those in Rome, ha 'e
been extolling the military prepara
edness of their motherland.
"Our army is ready," was the
press warning released yesterday.
Mussolini made little mention of it
in his speech.
Another paper reported that
Britain is striving urgently to
spread the war to the Mediterra
nean and Near East. They claimed
the English war scheme is such as
to "make the world believe the
British are being attacked by Italy,
and are not the actual aggres
sors."
Another press message said:
"With unchanging faith we soliders
arc on all of Italy's frontiers raising
our weapons and flags and ready for
whatever command, wherever the
King wis' cs and II Duce leads.
(United Press reports told of an
Italian claim to 1,000,000 men ready
for any occasion. Italy did not have
this number under arms until the
second year of World War I.)

spirited press denunciation
came from one correspondent
who saw four reasons for possibility
of spread of the war to the Mediter
ranean through British efforts.
1. To drag Turkey in, because the
Turks will fight only if Italy joins
Germany. Turkey could muster
from a million and a half to two
million troops.
2. To utilize the Allied forces in
Asia and Africa, now inactive and
maintained at a tremendous cost.
3. To make a French-Italian
struggle so imperative that France
can never back down in its war
against Germany.
4. To enable the British to be the
first to land in the Balkans. In this
area many nations still regard the
Allied troops as liberators from the
Rome-Berlin yoke.
Foreign observers who made
note of the strong tone of Italy's
press were impressed with the ap
parent attempt to fix any blame
for Kalian entry into the war upon
the British.
Reverting to the early days of
World War I, these reports claimed
that, "any attempt to fix the war
guilt question" generally implies a
desire to get in the war. On the
other side.
It is a well-known fact that in
1915 the Italian press was just as
scathing in its attitude toward Ger
many.
They joined the Allies soon after
that.
