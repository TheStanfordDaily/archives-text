# Newspaper Tax Hearing Postponed
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO, May 9 (UP).â€”
The California Supreme Court loday
postponed a rehearing on a recent
decision holding that newspaper
sales are subject to the state sales
tax.
The postponement had been agreed
upon by opposing attorneys in the
suit of C. M. Bigsby, a Los Angeles
printer, against the state treasurer.
The California Newspaper Publish
ers Association, Hearst Publications,
and others intervened in the case
on behalf of Bigsby.
It is the contention of the publish
ers that newspapers are a service
rather than a commodity, and should
not be subjected to the sales tax.
Should ihe lower court ruling lie
upheld, California newspapers will
be obliged to pay three per cent on
their sales and subscriptions for the
past 40 months, as well as in the
future.
