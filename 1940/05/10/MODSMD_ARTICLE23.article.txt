# START OF 70,000-ACRE LAKE
## 
### 

IN COLUMBIA RIVER canyon beyond the gigantic barrier of Grand Coulee Dam may be seen the start of
a new man-made lake which eventually will be 150 miles long and cover an area of 70,000 acres. A great
cascade of water over the dam itself will proVide spectacle in June and July of this year.
