HONOLULU, T.H., May 9 (UP).â€”
All routine transfers of naval offi
cers with the U. S. battle fleet have
been indefinitely postponed while
the fleet continues its maneuvers in
Hawaiian waters, it was revealed
unofficially today.
Informal comment by fleet offi
cers revealed a growing belief the
fleet is being kept in mid-Pacific
mainly as a diplomatic move origi
nating in Washington.
