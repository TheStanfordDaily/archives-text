# Appointment Service Relieves Stanford Grads' Job Worries
## College Education Aids Employment Record; 'Excellent Year' Predicted 
### JACK DALTON 
| Unemployment may be a pressing j
| national problem. But fortunately
i most Stanfordites graduating this
spring wiil not have to face it; that
| is, if the University appointment
j service maintains its high placement
percentage record.
Miss Ruth Tracksell, executive |
| assistant in the appointment service i
states:
"Practically any graduate in any |
field, who is capable in that field, |
! is now able to get a good position.
| A bad employment situation exists
generally, but young people from
good universities do not face the
same problem that older persons,
perhaps just as capable, do in se
curing desirable work."
Although placement figures for
| this year's class are not yet avail-
I able, Miss Tracksell said that this is
i "an excellent year" for appoint-
I ments.
JOBS OFFERED
The service is actually an out
growth of the depression, with more
prospective graduates applying each
year. An encouraging sign is the
large number of those who have had
to turn down jobs found the ap
! pointment service, because of posi
j tions already obtained individually.
Most large corporations maintain
; a large corps of representatives who
comb the major university campuses
each year, often to get outstanding
prospects to put in training positions
at a salary. Most of those already
placed from Stanford have been
picked by such representatives.
"Firms like Ingersoll-Rand Co.,
Dow Chemical Co., Ethyl Corp.,
Montgomery-Ward, Inc., and Stand
ard Oil Co. of California have al
ready interviewed and chosen many
j Stanford seniors," Miss Tracksell
j said. "From now on, local organi
zations will be asking for promising
grads."
OPPORTUNITIES PLUS
Miss Tracksell emphasized that
there is very little difficulty in plac
ing students with good scientific and
technical training in engineering,
chemistry, education, accounting,
business, etc. For those with a more
or less "broad" education, there are
excellent opportunities in sales and
business work.
Sufficient evidence of leadership
and good personality is usually
enough for those with no specific

training, Miss Tracksell declared.
"Large companies often like to
take students such as these and give
them the needed specialized train
ing after they get in the organiza
tion," she said.

"Practically any graduate in any |
field, who is capable in that field, |
! is now able to get a good position.
| A bad employment situation exists
generally, but young people from
good universities do not face the
same problem that older persons,
perhaps just as capable, do in se
curing desirable work."
Although placement figures for
| this year's class are not yet avail-
I able, Miss Tracksell said that this is
i "an excellent year" for appoint-
I ments.
JOBS OFFERED
The service is actually an out
growth of the depression, with more
prospective graduates applying each
year. An encouraging sign is the
large number of those who have had
to turn down jobs found the ap
! pointment service, because of posi
j tions already obtained individually.
Most large corporations maintain
; a large corps of representatives who
comb the major university campuses
each year, often to get outstanding
prospects to put in training positions
at a salary. Most of those already
placed from Stanford have been
picked by such representatives.
"Firms like Ingersoll-Rand Co.,
Dow Chemical Co., Ethyl Corp.,
Montgomery-Ward, Inc., and Stand
ard Oil Co. of California have al
ready interviewed and chosen many
j Stanford seniors," Miss Tracksell
j said. "From now on, local organi
zations will be asking for promising
grads."
OPPORTUNITIES PLUS
Miss Tracksell emphasized that
there is very little difficulty in plac
ing students with good scientific and
technical training in engineering,
chemistry, education, accounting,
business, etc. For those with a more
or less "broad" education, there are
excellent opportunities in sales and
business work.
Sufficient evidence of leadership
and good personality is usually
enough for those with no specific

training, Miss Tracksell declared.
"Large companies often like to
take students such as these and give
them the needed specialized train
ing after they get in the organiza
tion," she said.
| Unemployment may be a pressing j
| national problem. But fortunately
i most Stanfordites graduating this
spring wiil not have to face it; that
| is, if the University appointment
j service maintains its high placement
percentage record.
