### FRANK GUTHRIE 
DOTS AND DASHES AND
ONE OR TWO FLASHES
Those red spots you saw dancing
befor§ your eyes this week shouldn't
start you on your way to see an
optometrist . . . The blur was only
the initial showing of the track
men's traveling jackets, which ar
rived too late for the squad to wear
on their junket to Los Angeles . . .
The cost of the satin beauties
was defrayed by several men who
contributed, 1 heard, something
like $75 among them, so that the
tracksters wouldn't find themselves
financially embarrassed . . . These
men are Bill Ellington, A{ Mas
ters, Dr. Thomas Storey, and Mr.
Garnett Young . . .
Mr. Young, by the way, has >1-
lowed Stanford and Bay track tor
years on end, and as far as I can
figure out he hasn't missed a prac
tice session since October 1. . . . His
little black book is his most famous
piece of property. ... It tells the
story of week-to-week improvement
ot Stanford's record-breaking track
men.
For instance, he has recorded
Clyde Jeffrey's, Craig William
son's, Ernie Clark's, and Charley
Shaw's 352-yard dash times from
the time they first started run
ning this race last fall: and it has
Paul Moore's and Mushy Girard's
times from the 4-10 up to the two
mile listed.
No sir, Bill Ellington doesn't both
er to keep track of his men's exact
times. . . . There's Mr. Young out
there helping him out. . . . He likes
track and it's one way to enjoy it.
AN INTERESTED SPECTATOR
at just about every track practice
session has been Miss Margaret
Storey, daughter of Dr. Storey, who
can be seen about any time, with
watch in hand, doing a bit of clock
ing on her own hook. . . . During
the intramural track meet she acted
as one of the timers . . .
She's so well thought of as a
timer that she has been invited to
test her skill with experienced
dockers at the Pacific Athletic
Association's meet at Edwards
Field in Berkeley, May 18. ... If
she docs a good job she'll be given
an A.A.U. timer's credentials . . .
That would make her the first
(we believe) woman official timer
in the country. . . . We might
have to check on that.
The chances are she'll get an
A.A.U. card because of her expe
rience on Angell Field catching
Stanford runners . . .
Miss Storey also follows the
other teams in season, sitting in
the Pavilion during basketball
practices, and standing on the
sidelines in the fall washing foot
ball sessions.
DOTS SO: The trackmen present
ed Bill Ellington with The Daily's
original of that photolith drawing of
"Bill," framed, and with all the
trimmings, last night.
Two members of that 880-yard re
lay team which set a world record
in 1937 in Fresno are still here on
the Farm. . . . Stan Hiserman is
getting his teacher's credentials this
June in physical education, and Jack
Weierhauser is assistant track coach
and frosh head man.

track and it's one way to enjoy it.
AN INTERESTED SPECTATOR
at just about every track practice
session has been Miss Margaret
Storey, daughter of Dr. Storey, who
can be seen about any time, with
watch in hand, doing a bit of clock
ing on her own hook. . . . During
the intramural track meet she acted
as one of the timers . . .
She's so well thought of as a
timer that she has been invited to
test her skill with experienced
dockers at the Pacific Athletic
Association's meet at Edwards
Field in Berkeley, May 18. ... If
she docs a good job she'll be given
an A.A.U. timer's credentials . . .
That would make her the first
(we believe) woman official timer
in the country. . . . We might
have to check on that.
The chances are she'll get an
A.A.U. card because of her expe
rience on Angell Field catching
Stanford runners . . .
Miss Storey also follows the
other teams in season, sitting in
the Pavilion during basketball
practices, and standing on the
sidelines in the fall washing foot
ball sessions.
DOTS SO: The trackmen present
ed Bill Ellington with The Daily's
original of that photolith drawing of
"Bill," framed, and with all the
trimmings, last night.
Two members of that 880-yard re
lay team which set a world record
in 1937 in Fresno are still here on
the Farm. . . . Stan Hiserman is
getting his teacher's credentials this
June in physical education, and Jack
Weierhauser is assistant track coach
and frosh head man.
DOTS AND DASHES AND
ONE OR TWO FLASHES
Those red spots you saw dancing
befor§ your eyes this week shouldn't
start you on your way to see an
optometrist . . . The blur was only
the initial showing of the track
men's traveling jackets, which ar
rived too late for the squad to wear
on their junket to Los Angeles . . .
The cost of the satin beauties
was defrayed by several men who
contributed, 1 heard, something
like $75 among them, so that the
tracksters wouldn't find themselves
financially embarrassed . . . These
men are Bill Ellington, A{ Mas
ters, Dr. Thomas Storey, and Mr.
Garnett Young . . .
Mr. Young, by the way, has >1-
lowed Stanford and Bay track tor
years on end, and as far as I can
figure out he hasn't missed a prac
tice session since October 1. . . . His
little black book is his most famous
piece of property. ... It tells the
story of week-to-week improvement
ot Stanford's record-breaking track
men.
For instance, he has recorded
Clyde Jeffrey's, Craig William
son's, Ernie Clark's, and Charley
Shaw's 352-yard dash times from
the time they first started run
ning this race last fall: and it has
Paul Moore's and Mushy Girard's
times from the 4-10 up to the two
mile listed.
No sir, Bill Ellington doesn't both
er to keep track of his men's exact
times. . . . There's Mr. Young out
there helping him out. . . . He likes
track and it's one way to enjoy it.
