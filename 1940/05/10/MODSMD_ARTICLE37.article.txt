# Indian Tankmen Prep for Alumni
## 
### 
A large turnout greeted Coach
j Nort Thornton last month when
I spring practice in water polo got
under way, and three full teams are
| now working out.
Led by Ted Moreno, captain-elect,
several veterans will form the nu
cleus of the 1940 varsity although an
exceptionally hot fight is expected
[ for the forward positions. Big Dun-
J can Patty will be shifted from cen
; ter back to .sprint. Bob Jamieson,
who broke his jaw last year and
i missed the '39 season, will be back
on the job, and Roy Vitousek, who
was a tower of strength in the frosh
j goal two years ago, is expected to
lake over the cage duties.
Dave Nottage and Fred Manwar
ing are the returning lettermen at
forwards.
Fundamentals are being stressed
now with the spring sessions winding
up with a full-time game against the
! alumni Mav 24.
