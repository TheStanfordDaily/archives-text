# Indians, Troy To Fight It Out In Fresno Tilt
## 
### 
Revenge and world records will
he the chief ambitions of Stan
ford's trackmen when they en
train for the annual Pacific Coast
Relays in Fresno tomorrow.
Revengeâ€”in their first rematch
with a strong U.S.C. team which
beat them in dual competition last
week-end and in possible world
records in the half mile, mile, and
medley relay.
The meet will probably develop
into a duel between Indians and
Trojans, these two teams taking most
of the points. And the Cards, with
their power and depth in both the
sprints and distances, ought to win
most of the relays and, because a
first place in a relay earns 10 points,
ought to whip Troy.
As for world records, the Indian
half-mile team has a fine chance of
breaking the standing mark of 1:25
flat held by a Stanford team ol Ma
lott, Weierhauser, Kneubuhl, and
Hiserman. Last Wednesday Coach
Bill Ellington's quartet of Don Mc-
Farland, Charile Shaw, Ken Bat
taglia, and Captain Clyde Jeffrey
whipped through a half mile in time
only three-tenths of a second slower
than the standing market.
PASSES POOR
In this practice run, most of the
passes weren't what they could have
been and with a week of practice
the Cards ought to have smoothed
out their passing.
Provided Shaw, after his perform
ance in the half mile relay, Jeffrey,
after running several hundred-yard
dashes plus laps on the 440 and 880-
yard relays, Craig Williamson, after
a lap on the medley relay, and Ernie
Clark, following his half mile in
either the medley or two-mile re
lays, aren't too tired, these four
may break their own world record
in the mile relay.
ALMOST A RECORD
Yesterday the quarter mile team of
Les Johnson, Johnny Grant, Bat
taglia, and the versatile Jeffrey
turned in a 41.4 which is just one
second slower than the standing
world record. But they will have a
tough time licking the Trojan sprint
ers, Anderson, Willis, and Company.
With the apparently unbeatable
Mr. Jeffrey anchoring the three
sprint relays, the 440, 880. and mile,
the Indians can spot the Trojans a
few yards in each race and still win.
And with the tireless Paul Moore
bringing in the bacon in both the
two-mile and medley relays, it
seems that the Cards ought to make
a clean sweep of the relays if the
doubling-up acts don't get these two
key men too tired.
Despite the fact that both javelin
thrower Bob Stone and shot putter
Stan Andersen are doubtful com
petitors, the rapidly improving field
men will make a good account of
themselves and contribute to a
Stanford victory.
