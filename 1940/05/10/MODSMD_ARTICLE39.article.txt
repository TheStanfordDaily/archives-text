# Gridmen Polish Aerial Attack
## 
### 
I In* accent was on aerial ma
neuvers yesterday when Clark
sent his Indian grid
ders through a prolonged passing
drill un the varsity practice lield,
while over on the frosh gridiron
the fourth and fifth strings low
ered the boom in a scrum ses
sion.
A virtually unknown frosh, Quar
terback Ray Hammet, who managed
to play enough inconspicuous foot
ball last fall to win a numeral, was
the surprise of yesterday's drill.
Hammet alternated with Frankie Al
bert throwing passes behind the
first and second string lines, and
completed several good tosses.
Albert was missing on his early
pitches, but when he warmed up
and the squad got straightened out
on assignments, he threw a good
percentage of strikes. Frankie's
passing hasn't been as sensational
this spring as it was last year, prob
ably because of the strange assign
ments.
The squad will go through a full
scrimmage tomorrow in secret
practice.
