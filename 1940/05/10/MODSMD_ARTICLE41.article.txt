# Card Poloists Play U.S.C. Tomorrow
## 
### 
Stanford's polo team tackles U.S.C.
this afternoon in a four-ehukker
practice game preliminary to to
morrow's official clash. The Trojans
need to scrimmage here in order to
get used to the local horses.
After losing 7-15 in the southland
recently, Major Smith's men will be
out for revenge. The starting line
up will probably have Joe Smith at
number one, AT. La Prade two,
Gale Medlicott three, and Leonard
Weisenburg back. Trojans will be
headed by Stan Decker, Jack Mar
shall, and Jack Williams.
