TP HE EDITOR. SIR:
Probably some of the best evidence of the Ameri
can people's attitude toward the Euroj>ean conflict lies
in the following illustration. Six months ago I attended
a meeting of the Rotary Club at which a young man
was engaged to speak on the present European conflict.
He expressed the views that England was again fight
ing for democracy, and that the fate of America lay
with that of England.
I noticed the reaction of the men to whom he was
speaking. They were coolly courteous, but one could
see in their half-hearted applause that they didn't
really believe we would be drawn into the crisis. Two
weeks ago I visited the same club. The situation had
changed. Beside the American flag, which had pre
viously hung by itself, was a Flinch and an English
flag.
Another young man was addressing this same group
of business men. The attitude of the men was tense,
not that half-joking, ha If-believing air of six months
previous. Thev listened like men who believed and
needed only the stimulation of their beliefs to act.
The young man was talking about Great Britain and
America's duty to stand behind her. At the conclusion
of the speech there was prolonged clapping and nod
ding of the heads in approval.
Throughout the United States today this scene is
being enacted in hundreds of organizations of busi
ness and of professional leaders. What does it mean?
It means that as surely as a stick of wood drifts
downstream we arc drifting toward the European con
flict that will eventually engulf us. For despite what is
said to the contrary, when our leaders take belief in
a cause, it isn't long until the f>eople follow.
