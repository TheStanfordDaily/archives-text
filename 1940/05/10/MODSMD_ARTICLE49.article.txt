### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
WE TIIANK THEE, M.G.M.
NUMBER of people, afflicted with logicitis, have
complained bitterly about those more-for-your
money double features. But it seems to me that the
hyper-critics have missed the point—several points, in
fact. They have not thanked God (or M.G.M.) for
double favors.
Consider, for example, the comfortable air-condi
tiotiing of the modern theater. In the long cold of
winter, when the atmosphere is biting and house
heating is expensive, a movie theater affords a pleas
ant warmth and a comfortable seat. And when sum
mer's sticky heat makes even underwear unbearable,
the theater is cool and refreshing. Double features
simply prolong the pleasure. They cut down heating
bills in the winter and ice bills in the summer. We
thank thee, M.G.M.
Then there is a great psychological service ren
dered by the double bill; it swells and satisfies the
normal mind's ego. One sits complacently in his plush
chair and watches a thunderbolt appear on the screen:
The Gangsters Loot, with Pat O'Brien and Jimmy
Cagney. Within ten brief minutes one is able to say
to himself, "I know exactly how this is going to end;
why, hell, I would write that story myself." And the
ego is feted. We thank thee, M.G.M.
* aft * *
RUT having hit upon the warming fact that he is
able to write a picture like "The Gangster's Loot,"
whole vistas of day-dreaming are opened to the double
feature-goer. "Ha,' he muses, "I can write a story
just like the one for which that author was paid a
handy sum. Which means, I believe, that I will soon
be minting money on double-feature movie scripts.
Now let me see; when I get that dough ..." And
so the self-glorifying day-dream progresses. One is
able to spend millions, not only for automobiles and
chateaus, but also for the welfare of friends and un
derprivileged chaps. One becomes a bloated capitalist
and a purified benefactor in ten minutes. We thank
thee, M.G.M.
A fourth service of the double-feature is its gam
bling odds. It is estimated that one out of every thou
sand pictures released by Hollywood is worth the price
of admission. By simple arithmetic it can readily be
seen that when a movie fan sees one picture, the odds
arc 1,000-to-l that he will be robbed. When he sees
a double-feature, on the other hand, the odds are only
500-to-l that he will be robbed. We thank thee, M.G.M.
And thee too, Paramount, Warners, and the rest.

complained bitterly about those more-for-your
money double features. But it seems to me that the
hyper-critics have missed the point—several points, in
fact. They have not thanked God (or M.G.M.) for
double favors.
Consider, for example, the comfortable air-condi
tiotiing of the modern theater. In the long cold of
winter, when the atmosphere is biting and house
heating is expensive, a movie theater affords a pleas
ant warmth and a comfortable seat. And when sum
mer's sticky heat makes even underwear unbearable,
the theater is cool and refreshing. Double features
simply prolong the pleasure. They cut down heating
bills in the winter and ice bills in the summer. We
thank thee, M.G.M.
Then there is a great psychological service ren
dered by the double bill; it swells and satisfies the
normal mind's ego. One sits complacently in his plush
chair and watches a thunderbolt appear on the screen:
The Gangsters Loot, with Pat O'Brien and Jimmy
Cagney. Within ten brief minutes one is able to say
to himself, "I know exactly how this is going to end;
why, hell, I would write that story myself." And the
ego is feted. We thank thee, M.G.M.

RUT having hit upon the warming fact that he is
able to write a picture like "The Gangster's Loot,"
whole vistas of day-dreaming are opened to the double
feature-goer. "Ha,' he muses, "I can write a story
just like the one for which that author was paid a
handy sum. Which means, I believe, that I will soon
be minting money on double-feature movie scripts.
Now let me see; when I get that dough ..." And
so the self-glorifying day-dream progresses. One is
able to spend millions, not only for automobiles and
chateaus, but also for the welfare of friends and un
derprivileged chaps. One becomes a bloated capitalist
and a purified benefactor in ten minutes. We thank
thee, M.G.M.
A fourth service of the double-feature is its gam
bling odds. It is estimated that one out of every thou
sand pictures released by Hollywood is worth the price
of admission. By simple arithmetic it can readily be
seen that when a movie fan sees one picture, the odds
arc 1,000-to-l that he will be robbed. When he sees
a double-feature, on the other hand, the odds are only
500-to-l that he will be robbed. We thank thee, M.G.M.
And thee too, Paramount, Warners, and the rest.
WE TIIANK THEE, M.G.M.
