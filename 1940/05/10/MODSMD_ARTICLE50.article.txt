(Reprinted from The Daily. Vol. 76)
r I I HE traditional opinion of Stanford fraternity men
that the Administration is decidedly prejudiced
against organized living groups was dealt a harsh
blow last week at the National Interfraternity Confer
ence meeting.
Speaking before representatives of 66 national fra
ternities from 85 universities, Dr. Wilbur went on rec
ord as approving of fraternities—"good fraternities."
Stanford's energetic president has uttered few truer
words than his statement that to abolish fraternities
"would bring about something almost approaching a
revolution in American colleges," But he did not say
whether fraternities woidd continue to live and pros
per or die a natural death. He infers that their future
will be based entirely on their determined course of
action.
IF fraternities would abolish "slapstick methods" of
initiation and thereby attract the increasing number
of more mature men coming to universities from jun
ior colleges. IF the individual groups will make hon
est efforts lo raise the general plane of their scholar
ship. IF fraternities make their organizations less
amateurish—then fraternities will continue to grow
into wholesome organizations that will he assets to
American colleges.
But if fraternities choose the opposite course of
action, they will quietly go the way of the peg-top
trousers and the tally-ho. Such is the accurate analy
sis of the future of American fraternities made by a
non-fraternity man.
♦ * * *
Dr. Wilbur took over the administrative reins
of Stanford he could have abolished campus fra
ternities on perfectly justifiable grounds. The frater
nities were in a deplorable financial condition. They
were beini* hounded by the merchants of the Penin
sula for hills long overdue. Their scholastic rating was
a disgrace. They were organized solely "to eat. drink,
and be merry," and they did all three successfully.
But Dr. Wilbur did not abolish fraternities. He
suggested remedies for their ills and put it up to them
to sink or swim. On their own initiative Stanford fra
ternities satisfactorily improved. But despite all this,
fraternity men felt that the Administration was abiding
time when it could K've them the axe, and so the tra
dition grew up.
Such a clear-cut statement as Dr. Wilbur made in
New York, leaves no room for debate on the Admin
istrations attitude toward fraternities. Their future is
entirely in their own hands.

(Reprinted from The Daily. Vol. 76)
r I I HE traditional opinion of Stanford fraternity men
that the Administration is decidedly prejudiced
against organized living groups was dealt a harsh
blow last week at the National Interfraternity Confer
ence meeting.
Speaking before representatives of 66 national fra
ternities from 85 universities, Dr. Wilbur went on rec
ord as approving of fraternities—"good fraternities."
Stanford's energetic president has uttered few truer
words than his statement that to abolish fraternities
"would bring about something almost approaching a
revolution in American colleges," But he did not say
whether fraternities woidd continue to live and pros
per or die a natural death. He infers that their future
will be based entirely on their determined course of
action.
IF fraternities would abolish "slapstick methods" of
initiation and thereby attract the increasing number
of more mature men coming to universities from jun
ior colleges. IF the individual groups will make hon
est efforts lo raise the general plane of their scholar
ship. IF fraternities make their organizations less
amateurish—then fraternities will continue to grow
into wholesome organizations that will he assets to
American colleges.
But if fraternities choose the opposite course of
action, they will quietly go the way of the peg-top
trousers and the tally-ho. Such is the accurate analy
sis of the future of American fraternities made by a
non-fraternity man.

Dr. Wilbur took over the administrative reins
of Stanford he could have abolished campus fra
ternities on perfectly justifiable grounds. The frater
nities were in a deplorable financial condition. They
were beini* hounded by the merchants of the Penin
sula for hills long overdue. Their scholastic rating was
a disgrace. They were organized solely "to eat. drink,
and be merry," and they did all three successfully.
But Dr. Wilbur did not abolish fraternities. He
suggested remedies for their ills and put it up to them
to sink or swim. On their own initiative Stanford fra
ternities satisfactorily improved. But despite all this,
fraternity men felt that the Administration was abiding
time when it could K've them the axe, and so the tra
dition grew up.
Such a clear-cut statement as Dr. Wilbur made in
New York, leaves no room for debate on the Admin
istrations attitude toward fraternities. Their future is
entirely in their own hands.
