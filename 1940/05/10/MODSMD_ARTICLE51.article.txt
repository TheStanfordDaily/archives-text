# Cinema Portrays Real, Not Idealized Lincoln
## 
### 
"Abraham Lincoln in Illinois," now
playing at the Stanford Theater.
Instead of the penetrating charac
ter study that is the play, the movie,
"Abraham Lincoln in Illinois," pre
sents a panoramic account of events
in the life of "Honest Abe." Robert
E. Sherwood's story and its thrill are
still there, however, and make the
film excellent fare.
It is to the everlasting credit of
adapter Grover Jones that when he
used a scene of Sherwood's he dis
torted neither the dialogue nor the
purpose of the scene. RKO can dis
tribute the movie, bearing Sher
wood's credit line, with a clear con
science.
MASSEY IS REAL
As in the play, the character of
Mass—oops—Lincoln i.s inextricably
linked with that of Raymond Mas
sey. Massey simply is Lincoln, ugly
as a mud fence, monumental in his
awkwardness. And he adds some
thing to the character.
For two hours Abraham Lincoln
is divested of his grammar-school
history-book personality. He be
comes human, with faults and
doubts like anyone else.
Sherwood's play forces the con
clusion that, had Ann Rutledge
lived, little would be known of Abe
Lincoln today. After Ann died, all
Lincoln wanted was "to be left alone
in peace." Then along came grim
little Mary Todd, determined that
the man of her choice would be
President of the United tSates.
WHITE HOUSE OR BUST
In the process of driving him on
to that destiny, she lost any love he
might ever have had for her, but
she got the roof of the White House
over their heads.
The motion picture, of course, has
the edge on the play in at least one
respect. Action played against a
single background on the stage is
transferred profitably to multiple
backgrounds in the movie.
It is a moot point, however,
whether lines effectively given on
a stage without benefit of close-ups

are improved by the sight of the
actors' dewy eyes.
Supporting players in the movie
deserve much credit. Gene Lock
art's Stephen Douglas was fine, as
was Mary Howard's Ann Rutledge.
The movie was ably directed by John
Cromwell.
The second feature is "Seventeen"
with a grown-up Jackie Cooper in
the lead, supported by Betty Field
and Otto Kruger.—Mullany
