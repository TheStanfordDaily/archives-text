# 'I'm a Strangler' Authors Find Inspiration in City Night Club
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Once, when Ben llecht and Charlie MacArtluir were having a little
difficulty with a script they'd been assigned by some Hollywood producer,
they went to the head boss and told him that they absolutely could not
work unless they got away somewhere where it was quiet. The producer
said okay, and then forgot about the pair until six months later.

> After several frantic phone calls
and a few cogent telegrams, he lo
cated his wandering authors holed
up in a New York hotel room, hap
pily pounding out the script, with
two telephones ringing constantly,
members of New York cafe and
theatrical society charging in and
out, and all the clanging, hooting din
of Times Square traffic drifting in
the windows.
A LITTLE NUTTY. TOO
Of somewhat the same turn of
mind arc the three mentalities be
hind this year's Spring Show, "I'm a
St rangier Here Myself." which will
hold its first, performance a week
frotn tonight in Memorial Hall.
Authors Harry Muhcim, Al Zel
ver, and Charlie Bulotti wrote the
show during spring vacation. And,
after trying various localities in
which to work, the trio found that
the place most complementary to
their working-genius was the Top
of the Mark, where the show re
ceived its final polishing.
FARLEY COLLABORATES
Zelver and Muhcim decided to
write a show last summer quarter
on the Kappa Alpha sun deck. They
got no farther at the time. This win
ter, when Zelver was in the East, he
enclosed the skeleton plot for a
mystery comedy in a letter to Mu
heim. Muheim replied via post card
with a title—"l'm a Strangler Here
Myself."
According to Muheim, he thought
of the title while seeing "a grade-B
movie from a discontented produc
er." When asked why he thought of
it at that time he replied, "I don't
know—there was just nothing else
to think of."
