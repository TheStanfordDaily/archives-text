ers' Co-operative, Dr. Luck, who is
a charter member of the organiza
tion, declared, "A well-run co-oper
ative store can meet chain-store
competition, and can have great ef
fect. in controlling consumers' prices."
A CAE SUCCESS

co-operative dormitory, managed
and controlled by students, at Stan

operative housing groups. He men
tioned the University of California's
Co-op, characterizing it as "an out

Dr. Luck's advice on the building
up of a successful co-operativc store

ciples of consumers' co-operation,
and to use common sense. He em
phasized, "The great problem is to
adhere to democratic principles, and
to maintain the interest of all the
members."

ative store can meet chain-store
competition, and can have great ef
fect. in controlling consumers' prices."
A CAE SUCCESS

co-operative dormitory, managed
and controlled by students, at Stan
