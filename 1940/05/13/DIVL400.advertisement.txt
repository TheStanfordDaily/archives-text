Suppose this newspaper
hadn't a

The momentous happenings of a troubled world
would slill be yours for the rending. The up-to-the
minule news of your country, your town and your
community would still be raithfiilly recorded.

Cereals, meat, bread, fruit and canned foods are

tinental air service will get you further than columns
of dispatches from distant wars.
Let the advertisements help you to live! They list
the commodities and services which are vital to your
very existence. Here, at ease, in your own armchair,
you can compare the prices and values of the world's
I I offerings to //"//.'
