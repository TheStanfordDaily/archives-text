### WILSON CANNON 
back in 1914 A.D." may
well become the candle-light
and wine theme song of World
War 11.
The modern-day German attack, a
la 1940, has already outmoded many
of the once conventional fighting
methods.
The blitzkrieg, the parachute bri
gade, and the "fifth column" are
now every-day terms on the tongues
of Mr. Average Man and his wife.
The world of 1940 snickered
when Mr. Hitler began to play.
They couldn't believe his high
fancied notions would work. The
Polish preview caused many in
ternational horse-laughs.
But his cockeyed, impossible ideas
are finally proving their worth. And
John Bull, plus his allies, is worry
ing over ways to halt the lightning
bolts Adolf Hitler is tossing his way.
Under the fast-moving govern
ment headed by Prime Minister
Winston Churchill, England moved
yesterday to check any possible in
vasion of the British Isles.
Discarding the umbrelal in favor of
the big stick, Churchill began a na
tionwide round-up of enemy aliens
and placed Americans and other
foreign citizens under strict control.

A of the "win-the-war" Cabinet,
the drastic round-up was aimed at
crushing any "Trojan horse" move
ment under way in England.
With speed unprecedented during
the first eight months of England's
war, yesterday's, round-up affected
about 3,000 German and Austrian
citizens.
Police swept the length of the
nation at 8 a.m. to rout sleeping
Germans from Sunday beds. With
in a few moments they were
handed over to military authorities
and rushed to internment camps.
All other male aliens in the
British Isles were put under se
vere personal restrictions.
Even buses carrying troops were
halted because of fears that a Nazi
"fifth column" might resort to the
ruse of wearing British army uni
forms.
A usually placid English country
side assumed the proportions of an
armed camp as further defense
preparations were rushed to comple
tion.
Mobile military units equipped
with rifles, light machine guns and
hand grenades went to every cor
ner of the country. Squads of Tom
mies combed out-of-the-way nooks
to be on the lookout for any inva
sion by parachute.

with week-end crowds along the
scacoast. Lookouts were stationed at
every vantage point to scan the sky
for enemy troop planes.
The government issued radio
warnings to the country to report
any "unusual movements" of men
throughout the nation, whether they
were in uniform or not.
The usual calm of the English
stood up remarkably well under the
lightning-like governmental move
ments. From cockney to British
peasant, the civilian population went
their rounds with little outward ap
pearance of disturbance.
The move marked the first ap
pearance of the iron fist cloaked
behind the diplomatic exterior of
England's newly chosen Prime
Minister. British officials and flic
House of Commons gave their
verbal okeh to the Churchill
policy.
More drastic handling of the war
was pictured in the little crystal ball
by leading international forecasters.
Claiming that Churchill would give
England the "soldier's touch" so
badly needed, these experts pre
dicted even more drastic changes in
the early weeks to come.
In France, officials eyed defense
plans of their big brother and ally
with candid interest. Sources close
to the government predicted Pre
mier Paul Reynaud would follow
suit, soon ... or join Neville Cham
berlain on the retired list of World
War 11.
