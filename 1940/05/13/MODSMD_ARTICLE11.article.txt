# Nazis Meet Resistance In Belgium
## Counter-Offensive Successful at Canal; Allied Planes Assist 
### 
PARIS, May 12 (UP). —A Bel
gian counter-offensive is pushing
the Germans hack in the Maas
trict region where a violent, large
scale battle is raging along Bel
gium's fortified Albert Canal, the
French radio reported tonight
from Brussels.
The Belgian forces were supported
by fleets of British and French
planes which bombed and machine
gunned German columns and stra
tegic, German-held bridges.
Forced to retire yesterday under
heavy pressure when German me
chanized forces pierced the Albert
Canal and took Maastrict fortress,
the Belgian forces reorganized dur
ing the night and launched a
counter-offensive against the Nazis,
who were attempting to advance
farther west across Belgium toward
France.
NAZIS DETERMINED
Violent German attacks were re
ported by the high command in the
Meuse River region and along the
45-mile Albert Canal front.
While the Nazi forces drove
through the low countries, German
artillery batteries hammered away
violently in the Western Front sec
tors of the Saar and the West Vosgcs
Mountains where, the high com
mand reported, numerous battles
were raging.
A French military source said
that German infantry went into ac
tion against French advance posts in
the Saar and West Vosgcs sectors
under a screen of machine gun and
trench mortar fire. French artillery
opened up a counter-barrage, drop
ped a curtain of fire across No-
Man's-Land and shelled the Nazi
detachments attacking the outposts.
ALLIES POUR IN
Throughout, last night and early
today British and French troops
continued to pour into Belgium to
stem the tide of the advancing Ger
mans.
Military circles tonight summed
up the war operations thusly:
1. The Dutch were reported
holding their front line of defense
and dealing successfully with Ger
man parachute troops.
2. The Belgians were in the
midst of a counter-offensive after
giving way before a German ad
.vance yesterday. Allied air forces
were aiding ground troops, bomb
ing and machine-gunning German
columns and strategic bridge
heads held by the Nazis.
3. German large-wale opera
tions were reported opening up
along the Maginot Line.

PARIS, May 12 (UP). —A Bel
gian counter-offensive is pushing
the Germans hack in the Maas
trict region where a violent, large
scale battle is raging along Bel
gium's fortified Albert Canal, the
French radio reported tonight
from Brussels.
The Belgian forces were supported
by fleets of British and French
planes which bombed and machine
gunned German columns and stra
tegic, German-held bridges.
Forced to retire yesterday under
heavy pressure when German me
chanized forces pierced the Albert
Canal and took Maastrict fortress,
the Belgian forces reorganized dur
ing the night and launched a
counter-offensive against the Nazis,
who were attempting to advance
farther west across Belgium toward
France.
NAZIS DETERMINED
Violent German attacks were re
ported by the high command in the
Meuse River region and along the
45-mile Albert Canal front.
While the Nazi forces drove
through the low countries, German
artillery batteries hammered away
violently in the Western Front sec
tors of the Saar and the West Vosgcs
Mountains where, the high com
mand reported, numerous battles
were raging.
A French military source said
that German infantry went into ac
tion against French advance posts in
the Saar and West Vosgcs sectors
under a screen of machine gun and
trench mortar fire. French artillery
opened up a counter-barrage, drop
ped a curtain of fire across No-
Man's-Land and shelled the Nazi
detachments attacking the outposts.
