# Students Telegraph Protest To F.D.R'.s Defense Speech
## 
### ROSEMARIE MULLANY 
Several telegrams were sent to President Franklin Roosevelt Friday
night by Stanford students and living groups, who objected to his Pan
American policies as set forth in a speech delivered by the chief execu
tive that night before the eighth American Scientific Congress.
Bruce Jessup, student body president-elect, after hearing about the

.speech, dispatched a wire to the
President expressing the hope of
students that America would be able
to remain out of the war.
Joint authors of a protest were
Bob Livingston, president of the
senior class and former chairman of
Peace Council, and Larry Livingston,
former Daily editor and present
chairman of Peace Council. The
text of their message was as follows:
"With regard to your speech to
night we sincerely believe that
world science and culture and Amer
ican democracy can best be served
by non-intervention in the European
war."
BY EVERY MEANS'
Both Livingstons based their ob
jections principally on the last para
graph of. Mr, Roosevelt's speech
which read, "But I believe that by
overwhelming majorities you and I,
in the long run and if it be neces
sary, will act together to protect and
defend by every means our science,
our culture, our freedom and our
civilization."
lo a Daily reporter last night Bob
Livingston explained that the phrase
"by every means" was ambiguous,
and might include war.
Alan Green, president of Los Arcos
eating club and Toyon resident, said
in his telegram, "Feel I represent
youth of America when I say that
openly expressing pro-Allied senti
ment not in keeping with neutrality.
Sincerely trust your speech of this
evening meant purely as warning to
all belligerents to stay out of West
ern Hemisphere."
CAMERON OBJECTS
Others who sent wires were Pow
ers Cameron, president of Axe So
ciety, who objected to the "bellicose
and unneutral speech"; Elizabeth
Bobbins, Madrono; residents of Casa
Ventura, and the Alpha Delts.
In his address, President Roose
velt. questioned whether the Ameri
cas could continue their policy of
peaceful construction in the face of
"other principles of life."
"Is this solution—our solution—
permanent or safe if it is solved for
us alone/ the President, queried.
That it seems to me is the most
immediate issue that the Americas
face. Can we continue our peaceful
construction if all the other conti
nents embrace by preference or by
compulsion a wholly different prin
ciple of life?"
Other messages were rumored to
have been sent by various other liv
ing groups but no confirmation was
available last night.
