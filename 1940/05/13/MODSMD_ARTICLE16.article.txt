WASHINGTON, May 12 (UP).-A
storm of Congressional opposition to
night. hit proposals that the United
States throw open her treasure chest
to finance the Allied war front.
The suggestion was made by
Chairman Andrew J. May, D., Ky.,
of the House Military Affairs Com
mittee, who urged relaxation of the
Johnson Act which bans American
credits or loans to nations which
have defaulted on their World War
debts to this country. He contended
that "we ought to do everything we
can to help the Allies."
Sen. Hiram Johnson, R., Calif.,
author of the law and one of the na
tion's outstanding isolationists, vig
orously rejected this contention.
