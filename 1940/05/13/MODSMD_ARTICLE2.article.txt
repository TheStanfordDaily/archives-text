# Powerhouse Track Squad Wins Fresno Relay Meet Over Southern Cal, 70-63
## Stanford Cindermen Cop Nineteen Prize Watches; Jeffrey Hurts Leg, Will Not Compete in Finnish Races 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Stanford's powerful (rack team returned late yesterday afternoon from
the annual Pacific Coast Relays in Fresno with a revengeful victory over
U.S.C., a sackful of shining new watches as rewards for their performances,
and an injured track captain.
Taking four of the live relay races, and placing two men in the two

individual races and seven men in,
the field events, the Cards took the
Trojans 70 5-G to (58 1-3. Coach Bill
Ellington's crew won a grand total
of 19 watches through their victories
in the relays and on the field.
But victory spirits were dampen
ed by news that Captain Clyde Jef
frey had received what appears to be
a painful cramped muscle, 50 yards
away from the tape in his anchor
lap of the half-mile relay. Captain
Jeff will lay off all this week, forego
the Finnish Relief meet next week
end in Los Angeles, and start the
following week to get in shape for
the all-important Pacific Coast Con
ference Meet on May 25.
BREEZED HOME
Clyde had already done an eve
ning's work before he hurt himself
and nobody seemed aware-that any
thing was wrong with him the way
he breezed home in that 880-yard
relay.
He'd run a 9.5 hundred, just one
tenth of a second from the world's
record he tied earlier in the year,
and had pulled the Indians into a
victory over a surprisingly strong
U.C.L.A. quartet in the 440-yard
sprint relay.
BRUINS AID CARDS
By the way, it was the Bruins who
stepped in, and in the absence of
California copped a lot of valuable
second and third place points from
U.S.C. to aid the Cards in their vic
tory. In fact, Coach Duke Trotter's
boys beat Troy in three relays and
also crept in for five places in the
other events on the pi-ogram.
The only relay race the Cards lost
was, however, a personal victory
for their great distance man, Paul
Moore. The event was the medley
relay and Moore proved again that
he is the best collegiate niilcr in the
country by overtaking a 25-yard
lead held by Troy's Louie Zam
perini, only to lose by inches in the
final drive for the tape. Paul's time
for this mile approximated 4:11.
This was the opening event on
the program, and with a Trojan
win here, followed immediately
by two 219-foot throws in the
javelin by Southern California's
DcGroot and Peoples, things
looked rather dark for the Cardi
nal.
But from then on the Cards were
