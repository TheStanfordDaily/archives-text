# Powerhouse Track Squad Wins Fresno Relay Meet Over Southern Cal, 70-63
## Stanford Cindermen Cop Nineteen Prize Watches; Jeffrey Hurts Leg, Will Not Compete in Finnish Races 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Stanford's powerful (rack team returned late yesterday afternoon from
the annual Pacific Coast Relays in Fresno with a revengeful victory over
U.S.C., a sackful of shining new watches as rewards for their performances,
and an injured track captain.
Taking four of the live relay races, and placing two men in the two

individual races and seven men in,
the field events, the Cards took the
Trojans 70 5-G to (58 1-3. Coach Bill
Ellington's crew won a grand total
of 19 watches through their victories
in the relays and on the field.
But victory spirits were dampen
ed by news that Captain Clyde Jef
frey had received what appears to be
a painful cramped muscle, 50 yards
away from the tape in his anchor
lap of the half-mile relay. Captain
Jeff will lay off all this week, forego
the Finnish Relief meet next week
end in Los Angeles, and start the
following week to get in shape for
the all-important Pacific Coast Con
ference Meet on May 25.
BREEZED HOME
Clyde had already done an eve
ning's work before he hurt himself
and nobody seemed aware-that any
thing was wrong with him the way
he breezed home in that 880-yard
relay.
He'd run a 9.5 hundred, just one
tenth of a second from the world's
record he tied earlier in the year,
and had pulled the Indians into a
victory over a surprisingly strong
U.C.L.A. quartet in the 440-yard
sprint relay.
BRUINS AID CARDS
By the way, it was the Bruins who
stepped in, and in the absence of
California copped a lot of valuable
second and third place points from
U.S.C. to aid the Cards in their vic
tory. In fact, Coach Duke Trotter's
boys beat Troy in three relays and
also crept in for five places in the
other events on the pi-ogram.
The only relay race the Cards lost
was, however, a personal victory
for their great distance man, Paul
Moore. The event was the medley
relay and Moore proved again that
he is the best collegiate niilcr in the
country by overtaking a 25-yard
lead held by Troy's Louie Zam
perini, only to lose by inches in the
final drive for the tape. Paul's time
for this mile approximated 4:11.
This was the opening event on
the program, and with a Trojan
win here, followed immediately
by two 219-foot throws in the
javelin by Southern California's
DcGroot and Peoples, things
looked rather dark for the Cardi
nal.
But from then on the Cards were
unbeatable at the baton passing
events. The team of Johnny Grant,
Le.s Johnson, Ken Battaglia, and
Jeffrey took the 440-yard relay from
Last year Troy's sprinter, Barney
Will is, was the goat of the Fresno
meet, almost losing his pants in one
race and standing unprepared for
the baton in another. And last Sat
urday he played another tragic role,
pulling a muscle in his lap of this
quarter-mile relay, rendering him
self useless to his coach, Dean Crom
well, who had been counting on
him.
The other Indian wins were easy
and undisputed. They whipped
their only competition, U.S.C., by a
full GO yards in the two-mile event.
Jack Moore seemed to indicate that
Louie Zamperini is highly allergic
to the name of Moore by niftily gain
ing 10 yards on the great Zamp as
these two ran their last half-miles.
Teamed with Jack were Ernie Clark,
Burman Skrable, and Paul Moore,
and these four toured through two
miles in 7:47.8.
SPRINTERS SLOW
The sprint combinations of Don
McFarland, Craig Williamson, Bat
taglia and Jeffrey took U.C.L.A. by
four yards in time slower than they
had run in practice earlier in the
week. These four ran 1:26 flat,
which was seven-tenths of a second
slower than their previous best, and
a full second away from the world
record which they seemed capable
of breaking.
With Blair Hyde filling in nobly
for the injured Jeffrey in the mile
relay, the Indians romped to an easy
win in their favorite event, taking
those surprising Bruins by 12 yards
in 3:15.4.
On the field Stan Andersen showed
lit tie indications of his bad back by
throwing the shot 51 ft. 9 in. and
the discus 150 ft. 3 in., for two first
places. Russ Wulff rolled over 6 ft.
4 1 > in. in the high jump to split up
U.S.C.'s trio of jumpers and take a
second place.
WILLIAMS COMES THROUGH
Bill Trout in the shot and Arn
Cornett in the discus weren't able to
stay close enough to their teammate,
Andersen, and had to be satisfied
with a pair of thirds. The best In
dian come-through performance of
the meet was Bob Williams' throw
in the javelin. With Bob Stone ob
viously favoring his sore arm, Wil
liams took over for the Indians in
this event, throwing 198 feet, which
is 10 feet better than his best this
year, to take fourth.
Ken Battaglia, besides running a
pair of bang-up laps in the two
sprint relays, tied for third in the
ieatured 100 - yard dash with
U.C.L.A.'s Hal Sinclair behind Jef
frey and Troy's Mickey Anderson.
Dick Simpson's jinx among
U.S.C. hurdlers held, and again Dick
hit . several hurdles and wound up
unplaced in the finals. Mush Girard
was another tough-luck kid, being
the only Card distance man not to
win a catch. Hampered by his still
sore leg, Mush faded badly in his
1320-yard lap of the medley relay
and, because this was the only relay
Ellington's crew lost, didn't earn a
watch.

record he tied earlier in the year,
and had pulled the Indians into a
victory over a surprisingly strong
U.C.L.A. quartet in the 440-yard
sprint relay.
BRUINS AID CARDS
By the way, it was the Bruins who
stepped in, and in the absence of
California copped a lot of valuable
second and third place points from
U.S.C. to aid the Cards in their vic
tory. In fact, Coach Duke Trotter's
boys beat Troy in three relays and
also crept in for five places in the
other events on the pi-ogram.
The only relay race the Cards lost
was, however, a personal victory
for their great distance man, Paul
Moore. The event was the medley
relay and Moore proved again that
he is the best collegiate niilcr in the
country by overtaking a 25-yard
lead held by Troy's Louie Zam
perini, only to lose by inches in the
final drive for the tape. Paul's time
for this mile approximated 4:11.
This was the opening event on
the program, and with a Trojan
win here, followed immediately
by two 219-foot throws in the
javelin by Southern California's
DcGroot and Peoples, things
looked rather dark for the Cardi
nal.
But from then on the Cards were
unbeatable at the baton passing
events. The team of Johnny Grant,
Le.s Johnson, Ken Battaglia, and
Jeffrey took the 440-yard relay from
Last year Troy's sprinter, Barney
Will is, was the goat of the Fresno
meet, almost losing his pants in one
race and standing unprepared for
the baton in another. And last Sat
urday he played another tragic role,
pulling a muscle in his lap of this
quarter-mile relay, rendering him
self useless to his coach, Dean Crom
well, who had been counting on
him.
The other Indian wins were easy
and undisputed. They whipped
their only competition, U.S.C., by a
full GO yards in the two-mile event.
Jack Moore seemed to indicate that
Louie Zamperini is highly allergic
to the name of Moore by niftily gain
ing 10 yards on the great Zamp as
these two ran their last half-miles.
Teamed with Jack were Ernie Clark,
Burman Skrable, and Paul Moore,
and these four toured through two
miles in 7:47.8.
SPRINTERS SLOW
The sprint combinations of Don
McFarland, Craig Williamson, Bat
taglia and Jeffrey took U.C.L.A. by
four yards in time slower than they
had run in practice earlier in the
week. These four ran 1:26 flat,
which was seven-tenths of a second
slower than their previous best, and
a full second away from the world
record which they seemed capable
of breaking.
With Blair Hyde filling in nobly
for the injured Jeffrey in the mile
relay, the Indians romped to an easy
win in their favorite event, taking
those surprising Bruins by 12 yards
in 3:15.4.
On the field Stan Andersen showed
lit tie indications of his bad back by
throwing the shot 51 ft. 9 in. and
the discus 150 ft. 3 in., for two first
places. Russ Wulff rolled over 6 ft.
4 1 > in. in the high jump to split up
U.S.C.'s trio of jumpers and take a
second place.
WILLIAMS COMES THROUGH
Bill Trout in the shot and Arn
Cornett in the discus weren't able to
stay close enough to their teammate,
Andersen, and had to be satisfied
with a pair of thirds. The best In
dian come-through performance of
the meet was Bob Williams' throw
in the javelin. With Bob Stone ob
viously favoring his sore arm, Wil
liams took over for the Indians in
this event, throwing 198 feet, which
is 10 feet better than his best this
year, to take fourth.
Ken Battaglia, besides running a
pair of bang-up laps in the two
sprint relays, tied for third in the
ieatured 100 - yard dash with
U.C.L.A.'s Hal Sinclair behind Jef
frey and Troy's Mickey Anderson.
Dick Simpson's jinx among
U.S.C. hurdlers held, and again Dick
hit . several hurdles and wound up
unplaced in the finals. Mush Girard
was another tough-luck kid, being
the only Card distance man not to
win a catch. Hampered by his still
sore leg, Mush faded badly in his
1320-yard lap of the medley relay
and, because this was the only relay
Ellington's crew lost, didn't earn a
watch.
Stanford's powerful (rack team returned late yesterday afternoon from
the annual Pacific Coast Relays in Fresno with a revengeful victory over
U.S.C., a sackful of shining new watches as rewards for their performances,
and an injured track captain.
Taking four of the live relay races, and placing two men in the two

individual races and seven men in,
the field events, the Cards took the
Trojans 70 5-G to (58 1-3. Coach Bill
Ellington's crew won a grand total
of 19 watches through their victories
in the relays and on the field.
But victory spirits were dampen
ed by news that Captain Clyde Jef
frey had received what appears to be
a painful cramped muscle, 50 yards
away from the tape in his anchor
lap of the half-mile relay. Captain
Jeff will lay off all this week, forego
the Finnish Relief meet next week
end in Los Angeles, and start the
following week to get in shape for
the all-important Pacific Coast Con

Last year Troy's sprinter, Barney
Will is, was the goat of the Fresno
meet, almost losing his pants in one
race and standing unprepared for
the baton in another. And last Sat
urday he played another tragic role,
pulling a muscle in his lap of this
quarter-mile relay, rendering him
self useless to his coach, Dean Crom
well, who had been counting on
him.
The other Indian wins were easy
and undisputed. They whipped
their only competition, U.S.C., by a
full GO yards in the two-mile event.
Jack Moore seemed to indicate that
Louie Zamperini is highly allergic
to the name of Moore by niftily gain
ing 10 yards on the great Zamp as
these two ran their last half-miles.
Teamed with Jack were Ernie Clark,
Burman Skrable, and Paul Moore,
and these four toured through two
miles in 7:47.8.
SPRINTERS SLOW
The sprint combinations of Don
McFarland, Craig Williamson, Bat
taglia and Jeffrey took U.C.L.A. by
four yards in time slower than they
had run in practice earlier in the
week. These four ran 1:26 flat,
which was seven-tenths of a second
slower than their previous best, and
a full second away from the world
record which they seemed capable
of breaking.
With Blair Hyde filling in nobly
for the injured Jeffrey in the mile
relay, the Indians romped to an easy
win in their favorite event, taking
those surprising Bruins by 12 yards
in 3:15.4.
On the field Stan Andersen showed
lit tie indications of his bad back by
throwing the shot 51 ft. 9 in. and
the discus 150 ft. 3 in., for two first
places. Russ Wulff rolled over 6 ft.
4 1 > in. in the high jump to split up
U.S.C.'s trio of jumpers and take a
second place.
WILLIAMS COMES THROUGH
Bill Trout in the shot and Arn
Cornett in the discus weren't able to
stay close enough to their teammate,
Andersen, and had to be satisfied
with a pair of thirds. The best In
dian come-through performance of
the meet was Bob Williams' throw
in the javelin. With Bob Stone ob
viously favoring his sore arm, Wil
liams took over for the Indians in
this event, throwing 198 feet, which
is 10 feet better than his best this
year, to take fourth.
Ken Battaglia, besides running a
pair of bang-up laps in the two
sprint relays, tied for third in the
ieatured 100 - yard dash with
U.C.L.A.'s Hal Sinclair behind Jef
frey and Troy's Mickey Anderson.
Dick Simpson's jinx among
U.S.C. hurdlers held, and again Dick
hit . several hurdles and wound up
unplaced in the finals. Mush Girard
was another tough-luck kid, being
the only Card distance man not to
win a catch. Hampered by his still
sore leg, Mush faded badly in his
1320-yard lap of the medley relay
and, because this was the only relay
Ellington's crew lost, didn't earn a
watch.
Stanford's powerful (rack team returned late yesterday afternoon from
the annual Pacific Coast Relays in Fresno with a revengeful victory over
U.S.C., a sackful of shining new watches as rewards for their performances,
and an injured track captain.
Taking four of the live relay races, and placing two men in the two

individual races and seven men in,
the field events, the Cards took the
Trojans 70 5-G to (58 1-3. Coach Bill
Ellington's crew won a grand total
of 19 watches through their victories
in the relays and on the field.
But victory spirits were dampen
ed by news that Captain Clyde Jef
frey had received what appears to be
a painful cramped muscle, 50 yards
away from the tape in his anchor
lap of the half-mile relay. Captain
Jeff will lay off all this week, forego
the Finnish Relief meet next week
end in Los Angeles, and start the
following week to get in shape for
the all-important Pacific Coast Con
ference Meet on May 25.
BREEZED HOME
Clyde had already done an eve
ning's work before he hurt himself
and nobody seemed aware-that any
thing was wrong with him the way
he breezed home in that 880-yard
relay.
He'd run a 9.5 hundred, just one
tenth of a second from the world's
record he tied earlier in the year,
and had pulled the Indians into a
victory over a surprisingly strong
U.C.L.A. quartet in the 440-yard
sprint relay.
BRUINS AID CARDS
By the way, it was the Bruins who
stepped in, and in the absence of
California copped a lot of valuable
second and third place points from
U.S.C. to aid the Cards in their vic

boys beat Troy in three relays and
also crept in for five places in the
other events on the pi-ogram.
The only relay race the Cards lost
was, however, a personal victory
for their great distance man, Paul
Moore. The event was the medley
relay and Moore proved again that
he is the best collegiate niilcr in the
country by overtaking a 25-yard
lead held by Troy's Louie Zam
perini, only to lose by inches in the
final drive for the tape. Paul's time
for this mile approximated 4:11.
This was the opening event on
the program, and with a Trojan
win here, followed immediately
by two 219-foot throws in the

win in their favorite event, taking
those surprising Bruins by 12 yards
in 3:15.4.
On the field Stan Andersen showed
lit tie indications of his bad back by
throwing the shot 51 ft. 9 in. and
the discus 150 ft. 3 in., for two first
places. Russ Wulff rolled over 6 ft.
4 1 > in. in the high jump to split up
U.S.C.'s trio of jumpers and take a
second place.
WILLIAMS COMES THROUGH
Bill Trout in the shot and Arn
Cornett in the discus weren't able to
stay close enough to their teammate,
Andersen, and had to be satisfied
with a pair of thirds. The best In
dian come-through performance of
the meet was Bob Williams' throw
in the javelin. With Bob Stone ob
viously favoring his sore arm, Wil
liams took over for the Indians in
this event, throwing 198 feet, which
is 10 feet better than his best this
year, to take fourth.
Ken Battaglia, besides running a
pair of bang-up laps in the two
sprint relays, tied for third in the
ieatured 100 - yard dash with
U.C.L.A.'s Hal Sinclair behind Jef
frey and Troy's Mickey Anderson.
Dick Simpson's jinx among
U.S.C. hurdlers held, and again Dick
hit . several hurdles and wound up
unplaced in the finals. Mush Girard
was another tough-luck kid, being
the only Card distance man not to
win a catch. Hampered by his still
sore leg, Mush faded badly in his
1320-yard lap of the medley relay
and, because this was the only relay
Ellington's crew lost, didn't earn a
watch.
Stanford's powerful (rack team returned late yesterday afternoon from
the annual Pacific Coast Relays in Fresno with a revengeful victory over
U.S.C., a sackful of shining new watches as rewards for their performances,
and an injured track captain.
Taking four of the live relay races, and placing two men in the two

individual races and seven men in,
the field events, the Cards took the
Trojans 70 5-G to (58 1-3. Coach Bill
Ellington's crew won a grand total
of 19 watches through their victories
in the relays and on the field.
But victory spirits were dampen
ed by news that Captain Clyde Jef
frey had received what appears to be
a painful cramped muscle, 50 yards
away from the tape in his anchor
lap of the half-mile relay. Captain
Jeff will lay off all this week, forego
the Finnish Relief meet next week
end in Los Angeles, and start the
following week to get in shape for
the all-important Pacific Coast Con
ference Meet on May 25.
BREEZED HOME
Clyde had already done an eve
ning's work before he hurt himself
and nobody seemed aware-that any
thing was wrong with him the way
he breezed home in that 880-yard
relay.
He'd run a 9.5 hundred, just one
tenth of a second from the world's
record he tied earlier in the year,
and had pulled the Indians into a
victory over a surprisingly strong
U.C.L.A. quartet in the 440-yard
sprint relay.
BRUINS AID CARDS
By the way, it was the Bruins who
stepped in, and in the absence of
California copped a lot of valuable
second and third place points from
U.S.C. to aid the Cards in their vic
tory. In fact, Coach Duke Trotter's
boys beat Troy in three relays and
also crept in for five places in the
other events on the pi-ogram.
The only relay race the Cards lost
was, however, a personal victory
for their great distance man, Paul
Moore. The event was the medley
relay and Moore proved again that
he is the best collegiate niilcr in the
country by overtaking a 25-yard
lead held by Troy's Louie Zam
perini, only to lose by inches in the
final drive for the tape. Paul's time
for this mile approximated 4:11.
This was the opening event on
the program, and with a Trojan
win here, followed immediately
by two 219-foot throws in the
javelin by Southern California's
DcGroot and Peoples, things
looked rather dark for the Cardi
nal.
But from then on the Cards were
unbeatable at the baton passing
events. The team of Johnny Grant,
Le.s Johnson, Ken Battaglia, and
Jeffrey took the 440-yard relay from
Last year Troy's sprinter, Barney
Will is, was the goat of the Fresno
meet, almost losing his pants in one
race and standing unprepared for
the baton in another. And last Sat
urday he played another tragic role,
pulling a muscle in his lap of this
quarter-mile relay, rendering him
self useless to his coach, Dean Crom
well, who had been counting on
him.
The other Indian wins were easy
and undisputed. They whipped
their only competition, U.S.C., by a
full GO yards in the two-mile event.
Jack Moore seemed to indicate that
Louie Zamperini is highly allergic
to the name of Moore by niftily gain
ing 10 yards on the great Zamp as
these two ran their last half-miles.
Teamed with Jack were Ernie Clark,
Burman Skrable, and Paul Moore,
and these four toured through two
miles in 7:47.8.
SPRINTERS SLOW
The sprint combinations of Don
McFarland, Craig Williamson, Bat
taglia and Jeffrey took U.C.L.A. by
four yards in time slower than they
had run in practice earlier in the
week. These four ran 1:26 flat,
which was seven-tenths of a second
slower than their previous best, and
a full second away from the world
record which they seemed capable
of breaking.
With Blair Hyde filling in nobly
for the injured Jeffrey in the mile
relay, the Indians romped to an easy
win in their favorite event, taking
those surprising Bruins by 12 yards
in 3:15.4.
On the field Stan Andersen showed
lit tie indications of his bad back by
throwing the shot 51 ft. 9 in. and
the discus 150 ft. 3 in., for two first
places. Russ Wulff rolled over 6 ft.
4 1 > in. in the high jump to split up
U.S.C.'s trio of jumpers and take a
second place.
