## 
### 
HOLLYWOOD, May 12 (UP).—
Age finally caught up with that dod
dering old movie star, Shirley Tem
ple, and retired her from the screen
j tonight with a fortune estimated at
I $3,000,000.
She was 11 ycais old last April 23
and nothing the studio experts could
j do in the way of trick shoes, low
crowned hats and sloping-shouldered
j dresses could make her look any
J younger.
SHIRLEY SETTLES DOWN
So Shirley, through her mother,
Mrs. Gertrude Temple, laureled
her eontract with the 20th Cen
tury-Fox and settled down to en
| joy her old age in the sixth grade
of grammar school. She said she
| didn't feel old; she just guessed
she looked that way.
She said 20th Century-Fox had
j tried valiantly to put. Shirley into
pictures suitable to her age, but was
j unable to find anything belter than
i "The Little Princess" and "The
Bluebird," from both of which the
1 cash customers stayed away in
1 droves.
It was in "The Little Princess" that
I the technicians attempted to dis
guise Shirley's size. Net result was
i not flattering to Shirley, who re
l taincd her dimple, her curls, and her
vim, but who—as the harried ward
j robe master put it—was too all-fired
1 big.
"BLUEBIRD" LAYS EGG
Slill trying to save their great -
est asset—Shirley's pictures had
grossed more than $22,000,000—
the studio chiefs made her hero
ine of a multi - million - dollar
technicolor spectacle, callcd "The
Bluebird."
It laid a magnifident, red-ink-spat
tered egg.
Shirley's final movie, less elabo
rate, and still to be released, is
called "Young People" and stresses
comedy. It allows Shirley to be her
j own plump-legged self.

HOLLYWOOD, May 12 (UP).—
Age finally caught up with that dod
dering old movie star, Shirley Tem
ple, and retired her from the screen
j tonight with a fortune estimated at
I $3,000,000.
She was 11 ycais old last April 23
and nothing the studio experts could
j do in the way of trick shoes, low
crowned hats and sloping-shouldered
j dresses could make her look any
J younger.

Mrs. Gertrude Temple, laureled

of grammar school. She said she
| didn't feel old; she just guessed
she looked that way.
She said 20th Century-Fox had
