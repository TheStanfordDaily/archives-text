### 
NEW YORK, May 12 (UP).—Bim
eleeh, the three-year-old who came
back after a surprise defeat in the
Kentucky Derby to win the historic
Preakness last Friday, was hailed
today as one of the 20 richest money
winning horses in turf history.
With the $53,230 won in the Preak
ness, Bimelech's total earnings rose
to $204,065. His average for ten
races was unprecedented—the colt
has earned $20,406.50 per race since
the start of his career. His richest
race was the Belmont Futurity, in
which he earned $57,710.
To Japanese, who are nearly 10,000
miles away, the annual World Se
ries baseball games in America are
of major sports interest.
