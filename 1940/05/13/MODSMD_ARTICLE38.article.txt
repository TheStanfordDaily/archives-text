whom Stanford owes chiefly for its
fame as one of the best track teams
iii the nation, fyere greatly in evi
dence. These men, Paul Moore, i
Clyde Jeffrey, and Stan Andersen
(double winners in Los Angeles, :
May 4), came home with six wrist
watches.
And Ihe lesser highlights, Ken
ny Battaglia. Don McFarland.

THE STORY of the medley relay,
in which the Trojans nosed out by
inches Stanford's strong foursome, is
an interesting one. Charley Shaw |
led off in the quarter, and really had j
to run because Howard Upton of
U.S.C., reversing his usual tactics
of laying back, sprinted along with
Shaw all the way up to the 350-
yard mark.
Upton moved out in front go
ing o(T the turn, but Shaw putting
out every ounce of pressure gave
Blair Hyde an even start for the
NNO. Blair moved out in front
early, but Art Reading of Troy !
stayed in close and passed him on
the second lap. Hyde again
moved out in front, and. coming
(ill tlie far turn, turned on a sprint
which caught Reading napping so
that Girard was handed a five
yard lead.
Racing against Leroy Weed, Mushy
stayed out in front for two and a
half laps when Weed challenged and
passed him. Mushy, who had re
injured his leg muscle Wednesday j
night in practice, couldn't stand the j
pace, although he hung on gamely, 1
and Paul Moore had to start the '
mile 25 yards back of Louie Zam- !
perini.
♦ * 3{C
NO ONE THOUGHT Paul could !
do it, except Bill Ellington. Before
the race, Bill heard that Cromwell
intended to have Zamperini run a
59 first lap in an attempt to kill
Moore off, who instead ran it in 57
seconds. But Moore had his instruc
tions and didn't try to match Louie.
On the nose he ran his instruct
ed (50, (J3, and 65-second laps be
lling Zamperini, who after that 57- j
lap slowly dropped his lead until
Paul passed Zamp at the start of
the fourth. Both men started their i
sprints at the same time on the \
far curve, with Paul holding a foot
edge all the way until the final
yard when Zamp edged out in
front.
Moore's mile clearly demonstrated
that he is Zamp's superior in the
distances.

do it, except Bill Ellington. Before
the race, Bill heard that Cromwell
intended to have Zamperini run a
59 first lap in an attempt to kill
Moore off, who instead ran it in 57
seconds. But Moore had his instruc
tions and didn't try to match Louie.
On the nose he ran his instruct
ed (50, (J3, and 65-second laps be
lling Zamperini, who after that 57- j
lap slowly dropped his lead until
Paul passed Zamp at the start of
the fourth. Both men started their i
sprints at the same time on the \
far curve, with Paul holding a foot
edge all the way until the final
yard when Zamp edged out in

Moore's mile clearly demonstrated
that he is Zamp's superior in the
distances.

THE STORY of the medley relay,
in which the Trojans nosed out by
inches Stanford's strong foursome, is
an interesting one. Charley Shaw |
led off in the quarter, and really had j
to run because Howard Upton of
U.S.C., reversing his usual tactics
of laying back, sprinted along with
Shaw all the way up to the 350-
yard mark.
Upton moved out in front go
ing o(T the turn, but Shaw putting
out every ounce of pressure gave
Blair Hyde an even start for the
NNO. Blair moved out in front
early, but Art Reading of Troy !
stayed in close and passed him on
the second lap. Hyde again
moved out in front, and. coming
(ill tlie far turn, turned on a sprint
which caught Reading napping so
that Girard was handed a five
yard lead.
Racing against Leroy Weed, Mushy
stayed out in front for two and a
half laps when Weed challenged and
passed him. Mushy, who had re
injured his leg muscle Wednesday j
night in practice, couldn't stand the j
pace, although he hung on gamely, 1
and Paul Moore had to start the '
mile 25 yards back of Louie Zam- !
