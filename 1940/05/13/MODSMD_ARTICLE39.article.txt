## 
### United Press 
The Seals moved iuto a tie for
third yesterday with a double win
over Sacramento. It's only a mat
ter of time when Lefty O'Doul gets
his club rolling: last year San
Francisco sneaked into second
ahead of the Angels in a last
miiuite rush, and this year the
Seals are surprising early.
Larry Powell, going to the Red
Sox next year, allowed seven hits
in the opener but Old Pard Bullou
had to come to the youngster's res
cue in the ninth to stave off a Sac
rally. In the second game Ed Stutz
had one of his rare nights and re
fused to blow up, the Seals winning
4-3.
Lefty A1 Olsen kept the Padres on
top of the Coast League heap with a
four-hit, 6-0 job against Portland
after San Diego had lost the opener,

Oakland split a twin bill with Hol
lywood to stay two and one-half
games off the pace-setters. Ralph
Buxton allowed only three hits in
the first game, the Acorns winning
5-3. The Stars won the nightcap
3-1 to cop the series.
Seattle took a pair from Los An
geles, 5-3 and 8-6. Hal Turpin was
reached for 11 hits but went the
route in the opener. Kewpie Bar
rett, Paul Gregory, and Bill Walker
kept the Angels in check in the sec
ond game.
