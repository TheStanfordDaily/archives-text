# Row 'Mothers' To Be Debated
## Frosh, Sophs Argue Controversy Today 
### 
"Resolved: That Stanford frater
nities should have housemothers"
will be the subject for debate this
evening at the annual freshman
sophomore debate in the Education
auditorium. Dean John Bunn will
chairman the event, to which the
public is invited.
The Class of '43, represented by
Jim Frolik, Larry Werner and Bob
Libott, will uphold the affirmative.
Frolik is freshman debate manager
and Werner and Libott arc members
of the frosh debate team.
SOPHS TAKE NEGATIVE
Arguing on the negative side will
be sophomores George Jackson, Bob
Hammett, and Roger Boas. This
same trio made up last year's frosh
team which was beaten by the
sophomores.
"This issue really concerns the
whole campus," states Milton Marks,
president of Delta Sigma Rho, hon
orary debate society sponsoring the
meet. "For if housemothers are in
stalled in fraternities, it means that
there will be some similar arrange
ment in the men's halls too."
Inviting everyone on campus,
Marks emphasized that this will give
the administration a chance to see
the student points of view. Also the
rivalry and honor that arc at stake
between the two classes make it a
pertinent issue.
REBUTTALS FOLLOW
The form of the debate will in
clude two constructive speeches from
each side followed by one rebuttal
from both the affirmative and nega
tive. Following the speeches the au
dience will have a chance to ask
questions. Victors in the debate will
have their names inscribed on a per
petual plaque.
Judges for the contest will be
William D. Lockhart, associate pro
fessor of law; Clark Kerr, assistant
professor of economics, and Harry
N. M. Winton, history instructor.
This forensic tilt was revived a
year ago winter quarter after a
lapse of 20 years. The sophomores
won in 1939, debating on the topic,
"Resolved, that fraternities should
be abolished on the Stanford cam
pus."
