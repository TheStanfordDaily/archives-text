pKA\KU\ KOOSEVKLT is a pacifist.
* llnl his speech lo llie Antericaii Scientific Con
gress last Friday night sounded too much like
W'oodrou Wilsons "declaration speech to Con
gress in 1017 lo he exactly exhilarating. True
enough, the events <>l the past lew days in Kurope
are enough lo cast a certain degree of fear and
ihoughl into ever\ American mind; yet il is nol
the duty of the President of the neutral United
States lo follow up those events with a speech so
obviously pro-Allied in sentiment and in promise.
Despite his own personal efforts for nearly four
sears, the great Wilson ssas virtually forced into
liis final actions because the economic interests of
his government had aligned themselves completely
and ssilliout reservation ssilli the Allied cause and
because a stronger propaganda of the Allies had
luiill up a ins lli in America about the morality of
their cause.
"We must make llie svorltl safe for dcmocracv."
said Wilson, all the svhile knowing full svell he had
spent his efforts in sain.
on and I. in the long run and if il be neces
sary. will act together to protect and defend by
every means our science, our culture, our freedom,
.iml our civilization," fired the eloquent Koosevelt.
as the Star Spangled Banner burst into full back
ground bloom.
Patriotism is one thing: entering a war to light
the cause of either of these empire-mad alliances
to protect a civilization that is already secure and
free i-; another.
Il is not unpatriotic to say that the I niled States
can gain nothing but grief and depression out of
all v intervention, be il economic or through the
force of military posver. Ihe onlv way the I niled
Slates can defend "our science, our culture, our
freedom, and our civilization is bv maintaining
llie onlv absolute moral standard, a standard that
can be guaranteed onlv bs a strict and above-board
neutralils.
President Koosevelt hints that the Americas are
not safe Irom invasion. Through his deep love for
the l.nglish aristocracv. his administration is slowly
enlssining the net that can have the 1 niled Stales
in this holocaust in less lime than il look the British
lo evacuate \orwav.
llie oids invasion the I niled Slates need fear
will be that type of internal scheme which enveloped
a war-torn Russia during the World War. Only a
country weakened in bods and in spirit bs fighting
someone else s war of greed and territory can be
susceptible to such an invasion.
