# CAMPUS OPINION
## 
### NO FRILLS WANTED 
r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
I am going to many a Stanford man, and I ex
pect him, as my husband and father of my children,
to be a real man who has met and conquered his
problems alone. This means without tlie crutch that
cripples—a house mother.
My job is to bring the woman's touch into our mar
riage. Never mind his bringing along a college-induced
habit of indecision, plus a few warmed-over ideas of
his dear old house mother's. After 20 years of living
with his own mother, he surely must have all the
ideals and refining viewpoints that a woman can give.
Tacking on another four years of asking a new mother
the answers strikes me as criminally overdoing a good
thing.
Making tough decisions and facing the music for
mistakes are part of his contribution to our marriage,
and I don't think it's a service to either of us for a hov
ering house mother to rob him of his best chance to
test his character and resourcefulness in the heat of
campus battles.
Ye Gods! Marrage, a family, and a career are just
around the corner. So why all this eagerness to shield
him from using his head and heart and spunk in solv
ing whatever problems come his way? Making a suc
cess of marriage is difficult enough without making a
ritual of mispreparing college men for it by encour
aging them to run to a dear old lady and act on the
predigested pap that she hands out.
If his problems are big or small, he had jolly well
better solve them himself. If they are just too big, he
needs his Dad or the Dean of Men, whose door should
be opened and mouth closed to confidences.
In Stanford, my man has four years between a
mother left behind and a wife waiting ahead. This is
his rare time to get himself in hand, to become the
master of his fate—and mine.
Why gentle him about?
