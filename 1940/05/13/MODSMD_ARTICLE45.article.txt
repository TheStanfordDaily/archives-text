# BULL SESSION
## WHERE BOMBS ARE NEVER HEARD 
### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
r | I HE year 1917 is closer to 1940 than any date in his
tory. America now faces the hypnotic horror of
world-wide madness that lured us across the ocean
23 years ago. And the nearness of 1917 to 1940 does
not mean that the dead years of history are catching
up with modernity. It means that the current years are
bent backward.
We are approaching in reverse the ironic day when
Woodrow Wilson announced to the world that Amer
ica would fight for that which it held "closest to its
heart"—the democratic will of the people and a "con
cert of nations." But the idyllic honesty of Wilson and
the defenseless death of the world's soldiers and the
multi-billion dollar histrionics of explosives and steel—
all these have failed. Not a sound step was taken in
the direction of world peace. No real blows were
struck at tyranny; no march was made under the gen
eralship of progress.
The fight for democracy has come to less than
nothing. It has come to 23-year-postponed murder
and destruction. And the fight for democracy has
come to murder because no democracy is secure that
rests on festering dissatisfaction. No republic can stand
on the quicksilver foundations of social maladjust
ment.
* D> * *
WHEN the international scene is electrified with
marching hate, few arc able to think of the na
tional foundations of freedom. But regardless of what
dramatic concentration America may direct toward
the world's battlefields, American democracy is fight
ing a more crucial battle where bombs are never
heard. American democracy is not menaced by the
terrors of Europe, but by the unsolved economic and
social problems which prevent domestic harmony and
internal security.
In 1917 and 1918 we turned from these same domes
tic problems to subjugate the Kaiser's armies. But the
defeat of Germany did not secure American democ
racy, any more than it insured a peaceful Europe.
War did not realize these dreams because the social
problems that nurture violence had been left un
solved.
And now the country is once again beset with false
causes abroad. And now the country more than ever
is beset with internal challenges to freedom. Whether
we repeat the dramatic and bloody goose-chase on
foreign fronts, or whether we continue our attempts to
put our own house in order may be the choice upon
which democracy depends—the questions which, if an
swered foolishly, may be an invitation for dictator
ships to find new quarters in the western world.
In time of war, it. is difficult to think of peace and
the problems of peace, because we imagine that democ
racy's battlefront is the scene of war. But there is a
more vital battlefront between the Atlantic and the
Pacific—the battlefront of peace.

put our own house in order may be the choice upon
which democracy depends—the questions which, if an
swered foolishly, may be an invitation for dictator
ships to find new quarters in the western world.
In time of war, it. is difficult to think of peace and
the problems of peace, because we imagine that democ
racy's battlefront is the scene of war. But there is a
more vital battlefront between the Atlantic and the
Pacific—the battlefront of peace.
r | I HE year 1917 is closer to 1940 than any date in his
tory. America now faces the hypnotic horror of
world-wide madness that lured us across the ocean
23 years ago. And the nearness of 1917 to 1940 does
not mean that the dead years of history are catching
up with modernity. It means that the current years are
bent backward.
We are approaching in reverse the ironic day when
Woodrow Wilson announced to the world that Amer
ica would fight for that which it held "closest to its
heart"—the democratic will of the people and a "con
cert of nations." But the idyllic honesty of Wilson and
the defenseless death of the world's soldiers and the
multi-billion dollar histrionics of explosives and steel—
all these have failed. Not a sound step was taken in
the direction of world peace. No real blows were
struck at tyranny; no march was made under the gen
eralship of progress.
The fight for democracy has come to less than
nothing. It has come to 23-year-postponed murder
and destruction. And the fight for democracy has
come to murder because no democracy is secure that
rests on festering dissatisfaction. No republic can stand
on the quicksilver foundations of social maladjust
ment.

WHEN the international scene is electrified with
marching hate, few arc able to think of the na
tional foundations of freedom. But regardless of what
dramatic concentration America may direct toward
the world's battlefields, American democracy is fight
ing a more crucial battle where bombs are never
heard. American democracy is not menaced by the
terrors of Europe, but by the unsolved economic and
social problems which prevent domestic harmony and
internal security.
In 1917 and 1918 we turned from these same domes
tic problems to subjugate the Kaiser's armies. But the
defeat of Germany did not secure American democ
racy, any more than it insured a peaceful Europe.
War did not realize these dreams because the social
problems that nurture violence had been left un
solved.
And now the country is once again beset with false
causes abroad. And now the country more than ever
is beset with internal challenges to freedom. Whether
we repeat the dramatic and bloody goose-chase on
foreign fronts, or whether we continue our attempts to
put our own house in order may be the choice upon
