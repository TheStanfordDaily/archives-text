# Another Man's View
## THE 						'AVERAGE' STUDENT 
### 
(Reprinted from The Daily Trojan, U.S.C.)
yy, HEN the "average eollege student" is placed be
fore the public, he is usually described in many
ways with many words. He is called anything from a
playboy to a scholar. He is portrayed as a Jiving
paradox or a great learner.
But what does the average college student think of
himself? Does be agree with the picture which the
public paints for him? What are his aims, thoughts,
and hopes?
One of the most comprehensive self-portraits of the
"average college student" of America was a recent poll
conducted at the University of Texas. Although the
survey only mirrors the ideas and opinions of several
thousand students of that institution, it could have
embraced no great variations if it were taken of
America's whole college population. .
According to results, the average college student is
found not to be a playboy nor a great scholar nor a
living paradox.
* * !f *
JJE thinks that his moral standards are about the
same as those of his own ago who do not come
to college.
He is highly hopeful about the world he is to enter.
He prefers to take a job that pays a high wage but
with a 50-50 chance of getting promoted or fired
rather than a steady job earning just enough to get
by with no promise of advancement.
He thinks that once he gets permanently estab
lished in the world, a monthly income of approxi
mately $300 would be sufficient for a living. He would
prefer to go into business of his own rather than
work for someone else.
The average male student agrees that 25 is the
ideal aye for marriage, while the average eot'd favors
an earlier age. anywhere between 21 to 25.
And, contrary to public belief, the average college
man does not prefer blondes; both the man and the
coed like brunettes.
