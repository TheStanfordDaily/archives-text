# Dotty Dresses, Finally Acts in 'Johnny Apollo'
## 
### 
"Johnny Apollo," with Tyrone Pow
er, now playing at the Stanford
Theater.
According to tlie stories liiat are
going around, this movie is based on
an actual story of a college boy
turned gangster. Apparently they
took this story and combined it with
the Richard Whitney (late of the
New York Stock Exchange) saga.
The result is a not very believable,
but darn swell movie.
Power Is the son of a millionaire
broker, played by Edward Arnold,
who is convicted of embezzlement.
Then the son sets out to get his
father out of jail, and to do same he
becomes front man for a racketeer.
From there on in, it's keeping somiy
out of jail, while working on the
deal to get pop out.
ACTING RATES HIGH
Acting in this show rates con
sistently high. Power gives a sincere,
beautifully keyed performance. Ed
ward Arnold does his usual top
flight job. Walter Brennan is an ex
cellent drunken attorney, and Dor
othy Lamour actually acts—she's
full dressed too.
What gives the show its punch is
the direction. It's all subdued, mi
nor, with lines subtly pointed in a
masterful fashion. Camera-work is
good too—particularly the shot of
Lamour through a prison grating
with tears bedewing her cheeks, but
miraculously missing the mascara.
Ex - Stanford man Lloyd Nolan
plays a gangster with so much ease
that you begin to wonder whether
this idea of college-bred men-of
the-underworld is so impossible after
all.
NEWS REACTION NOTED
Noteworthy is the audience re
action to the news reel. You see in
quick succession the German troop
ships dropping depth bombs on the
way into Trondheim; German planes
unloading troops in Norway; Ne
ville Henderson calling Hitler the
twentieth century equivalent of At
tila the Hun; and a sector of the
French lines with grim, tired-look
ing soldiers manning machine guns
while standing ankle-deep in muck.
And there are six or seven German
bodies lying out under the barbed
wire.
No one hissed the Nazi troops; no i
one cheered those French machine- i
gunners. The theater was dead j
quiet.—Nowell
