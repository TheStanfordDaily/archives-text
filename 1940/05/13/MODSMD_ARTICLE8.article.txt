# Spring Show Ticket Sales Begin Today
## 
### 
Tickets for "I'm a Strangler Here
Myself," to be presented Friday and
Saturday nights in Memorial Hall,
will go on sale today in the A.S.S.U.
office, according to Gordy Weber,
dramatic manager. Seats are priced
at $1, 75 cents, and 50 cents.
When the curtain rises on the
first scene of "Strangler" the audi
ence will be confronted with a
practically exact duplicate of one
of the classrooms in the basement
of the English corner, complete with
steam-pipes, posts, and cracks in the
plaster.
However, Technical Director Pete
Wangenheim and Construction Di
rector Wally Teed have departed
from the accuracy angle in their
version of a fraternity house. This
interior will be extremely modern
with a translucent window and
mural paintings over the fireplace.
A 15-foot suspended balcony is vis
ible in the rear of the set.
The home of Professor Steele fea
tures real English wood paneling
clear around the set and ten feet
high. All three of the sets will be
on rollers to facilitate quick scene
shifting. This is in keeping with
Director Bulotti's promised "fast
show."
