### WILSON CANNON 
T HE world's only woman ruler
yesterday joined King Haakon
of Norway as "monarch without a
kingdom."
Queen Wilhelmina of the Nether
lands fled to London to set up a
temporary government. She was ac
companied by her key ministers and
the rest of the royal family.
The 59-year-old monarch took
refuge in England after a German
attempt tcj "capture" her, and the
aerial bombing of a coastal point
where she intended to take ref
uge.
In Holland, solemn defenders
dug into last ditch lines. Dutch
men belied the traditional wooden
shoes and heavy pipe as every able
bodied man took up arms in a des
perate fight to the finish.
A mud-covered, weary Dutch
company made ready for any attack
that might come over from old Ger
many.
In Germany, high officials spoke
with keenest confidence of an early
victory over little Holland. In the
streets, the aplomb of Reich lead
ers was echoed.
Queen Wilhelmina's flight was
termed "the beginning of the end"
by a victory-predicting Nazi press.
In England, no ceremony and no
red carpet greeted the pale and
wan monarch. There was little to
show that an Allied ruler had ar
rived in Britain.
With courtly understanding, King
George kissed Queen Wilhelmina on
each cheek. A sudden burst of
cheering signalled the departure of
the royal car to Buckingham palace.

them, in Holland, the
royal family left a sti'ongly
functioning defense. The com
mander-in-chief of the Dutch anned
forces issued an appeal by radio for
complete national unity.
From London, a statement was
broadcast envisioning an early re
turn to the Netherlands for Queen
Wilhelmina.
Neutral quarters, summarizing the
Netherlands situation, were strongly
of the opinion that the Dutch were
in a bad way.
Flat northern Holland, not de
signed to be held under Dutch de
fense plans, is already swarming
with green-grey Reich invaders.
Key Dutch positions at the
Maastricht "appendix" threatened
to become untenable as the result
of a three-pronged German attack.
One prong is aimed at severing
Belgium from Holland. The sec
ond is pointed toward the Liege
forts. A third hit for Brussels.
Allied quarters regarded the Ger
man thrusts from this position as
most, dangerous. A Reich victory
along these tangents would turn the
Dutch main defense line ... as well
as paralyzing Belgian key positions.
Over Dutch coastal areas English
planes droned as the new Churchill
government moved in defense of
their embattled allies.
J|t * *
r J' , HE three-day Prime Minister
threw the force of his armies
into Belgium and Holland to pre
vent a quick, knockout blow by the
Hitler forces.
While the soldiers of England
were surging in defense of the low
countries, their Prime Minister was
winning a unanimous vote of confi
dence in both houses of Parlia
ment.
Churchill, whose vow to strike
"hard and quickly" was widely
cheered by Parliament, obtained a
381 to 0 vote in the House, and a
unanimous vote in the House of
Lords.
(Press reports were tinted with
a victory spirit shown in both
houses since the Churchill regime.
Former chief Neville Chamberlain
obtained a slim 8(Â» plurality in his
last vote of confidence before re
signing.)
Fiery Winston Churchill spoke
before the House for only seven
minutes. His words were so com
pelling that they brought acclaiming
cheers from all corners of the build
