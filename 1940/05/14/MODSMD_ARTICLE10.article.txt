# Class of '43 Wins Debate Over Sophs
## Victorious Freshmen Favor Housemothers For Fraternity Men 
### 
The Class of '43 verbally trounced
the sophomore triumvirate in last
night's second annual forensic tilt.
The victorious freshmen upheld the
affirmative of "Resolved, that Stan
ford fraternities should have house
mothers."
Arguing that the primary purpose
of a college education is preparation
for life, Jim Frolik, first speaker for
the affirmative, contended that the
presence of a house mother in fra
ternities would aid in achieving
this end.
He listed the house mother's duties
as including the functions of man
ager and adviser. Citing statistics,
Frolik pointed out that more fra
ternity men fail in studies than non-
Row men.
PLAN ILLOGICAL'
Speaking for the negative, Roger
Boas characterized the house mother
plan as "asinine and illogical." He
emphasized two main points: (a)
that the cost to install living quar
ters for, and pay the salary of the
housemother is too expensive; and
(b) the Daily student poll shows
that fraternity men have expressed
themselves as opposed to house
mothers.
Second speaker for the affirma
tive, Larry Werner, avowed that
house mothers would be an eco
nomic advantage in dealing with
alumni whose contributions aid the
houses. Especially emphasizing the
food problem, Werner stated that
students cannot manage the houses
efficiently while carrying on their
studies.
Bob Hammett, second sophomore
negative debater, maintained that
the disadvantages of installing house
mothers far outweigh the few advan
tages. He suggested that a council
of alumni members would be a more
desirable in managing a men's liv
ing group.
MEET OWN PROBLEMS'
Giving the freshman rebuttal was
Bob Libott, who asserted that the
financial difficulties of the houses
evidenced the need of supervision of
their management. George Jackson,
speaking in conclusion for the
sophomores, maintained that the col
lege man should meet his own
problems.
Dean of Men John Bunn chair
manned the debate. Judges were
William D. Lockhart, associate pro
fessor of law; Clark Kerr, assistant
professor of economics; and Harry
N. M. Winton, history instructor.
Milton Marks introduced the
speakers.

The Class of '43 verbally trounced
the sophomore triumvirate in last
night's second annual forensic tilt.
The victorious freshmen upheld the
affirmative of "Resolved, that Stan
ford fraternities should have house
mothers."
Arguing that the primary purpose
of a college education is preparation
for life, Jim Frolik, first speaker for
the affirmative, contended that the
presence of a house mother in fra
ternities would aid in achieving
this end.
He listed the house mother's duties
as including the functions of man
ager and adviser. Citing statistics,
Frolik pointed out that more fra
ternity men fail in studies than non-
Row men.
PLAN ILLOGICAL'
Speaking for the negative, Roger
Boas characterized the house mother
plan as "asinine and illogical." He
emphasized two main points: (a)
that the cost to install living quar
ters for, and pay the salary of the
housemother is too expensive; and
(b) the Daily student poll shows
that fraternity men have expressed
themselves as opposed to house
mothers.
Second speaker for the affirma
tive, Larry Werner, avowed that
house mothers would be an eco
nomic advantage in dealing with
alumni whose contributions aid the
houses. Especially emphasizing the
food problem, Werner stated that
students cannot manage the houses
efficiently while carrying on their
studies.
Bob Hammett, second sophomore
negative debater, maintained that
the disadvantages of installing house
mothers far outweigh the few advan
tages. He suggested that a council
of alumni members would be a more
desirable in managing a men's liv
ing group.
MEET OWN PROBLEMS'
Giving the freshman rebuttal was
Bob Libott, who asserted that the
financial difficulties of the houses
evidenced the need of supervision of
their management. George Jackson,
speaking in conclusion for the
sophomores, maintained that the col
lege man should meet his own
problems.
