# Senior Law Men to Contest Fair Labor Act in Moot Court
## 
### BOB LOW 
A statute prohibiting shipment of goods made by child labor was de
clared unconstitutional in 1918 by the Supreme Court of the United States.
The same question of child labor which has been before the states in
the form of a constitutional amendment will be a maior point of discus
sion tomorrow when seniors in the law school will debate the validity of

Fair Labor Standards Act in the
Moot Court.
With three prominent California
jurists as judges, the "court" will be
in session at 7:30 o'clock in the Edu
cation Auditorium. The public is in
vited.
SUPREME COURT CASE
Interest in this year's Moot Court
has been intensified by the possi
bility that the Supreme Court today
in Washington will hand down a de
cision on a child labor case closely
resembling the case before the Moot
Court.
For more than a month Horace
Hahn and Owen Goodman have
been preparing briefs with the con
tention that the act is valid, while
Harold Fulkerson and William
Snell have been working on an ar
gument that will convince the
judges that the law is void.
CASH PRIZE GIVEN
The hypothetical case before the
Moot Court contains points de
pendent upon important New Deal
social legislation. The Garden Fur
niture Company has been enjoined
from producing or shipping goods
intended for interstate commerce be
cause the company has violated the
maximum hour and minimum wage
provisions as well as the child labor
provisions under the act.
Both respondents and appellants
were confident of proving their
cases last night and they were eager
to know the attitude—liberal or con
servative—of the three men who j
will hand down a verdict. Victory
will be sweetened for the winning
pair with the annual cash prize
awarded by the Law Society.
JUDGES LISTED
While the contestants discussed
j the attitude of the judges, in reality
I the decision will rest solely upon
the ability of the opposing sides to
! present their cases and on the qual
j ity of their briefs.

i Ham Healy, of the U.S. Circuit Court
