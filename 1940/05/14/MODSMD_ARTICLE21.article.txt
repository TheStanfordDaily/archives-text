# Nazis Claim Air Victories As Land Forces Overrun European Low Countries
## Hitler Strikes To Win Holland, Capture Liege 
### United Press 
The momentum of the lightning
German assault on the low coun
tries, and the striking power of
the Nazi air force, is forcing Allied
defenders to fall hack in the ini
tial phases of what promises to he
the greatest battle in history.
German lorces are overrunning
Holland after having driven west
ward to Rotterdam and splitting the
country in half, apparently isolating
the famed "fortress of Holland" as
the Rotterdam-Amsterdam-Utrecht
fortified area is called.
In Belgium the fortress of Liege,
backbone of the defense system, is
being flanked, as is the Albert Canal
defense line, by German columns
moving with unprecedented speed.
The way for them is being cleared
by the powerful Nazi air force and
the Germans claim jubilantly that
"enemy resistance in the air has
been broken in a number of air
battles" with more than 100 Allied
planes shot down in less than 12
hours fighting.
QUICK AIR THRUSTS
It was the devastating attacks by
the German air force which forced
Allied troops out of Norway. In the
low countries Germany is attempt
ing the same tactics which won for
her in Norway and in Poland.
It must be remembered, however,
that the great battle now is in its
initial stages. The main opposing
forces are not expected to join battle
for at least 48 hours, and perhaps
later. The titanic struggle, roaring
to an ever-mounting crescendo of
slaughter, may go on for many days
and perhaps weeks.
NEW DEVELOPMENTS
Its bloody initial stages and its
promise of new highs in slaughter
and destruction had these reper
cussions:
1. German columns moving at
undreamed of speed split Holland
in two and give promise of over
running stubbornly fighting Dutch
defenders.
2. Dutch government and royal
family fled ot London, where
"temporary" government was set
up.
3. British and French joined Bel
gians in the front lines and began
strong counter-attacks which seem
ed to have stalled the Nazi advancc
through Belgium.
4. French apparently repulsed
determined German attacks
through conquered Luxembourg
and in the Moselle-Saarhruecken
sector of western front.
More than 3.000,000 men of five
nations were estimated to bo en
gaged along a 300-mile battlefront
stretching from northern Holland to
the Rhine in the heart of Europe.
The focal center of the gigantic con
flict appeared to bo fixing itself in
central Belgium, where the initial
stages were under way.
