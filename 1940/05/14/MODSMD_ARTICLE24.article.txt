# Cast Riots Through Rehearsal As Bulotti, Muheim Tear Hair
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
If you're one of those people who [
like to sit quietly by and watch other |
people suffer then you would cer
tainly have enjoyed the first full re- |
hearsal of "I'm a Strangler Here |
Myself" which started yesterday j
afternoon and which lit (i o'clock [
showed signs of continuing right on i
into today's 8 o'clocks.
It was Scene II for two hours with
Director Charlie Bulotti tearing his
hair, co-author and leading man |
Harry Muheim yelling "louder" at !
brief intervals, the cast milling j
around both on and off stage, and j
rehearsal-pianist A1 Green tinkling
away aimlessly during lulls, and I
with purpose during songs.
John Lawry, the corpse, was sit- I
ting in the audience howling happily j
over the lines, certainly not com- j
(alimentary to the character he is ;
portraying. Strange and cryptic ]
comments suddenly break through j
above the occupational murmur of i
a rehearsal. Things like:
"I don't care how it sounds so long !
Us you all hit the same note."
"React, damn it!"
"He's so flat he's practically har- I

| monizing."
About half-way through the sec
ond scene proceedings stalled while
| Bulotti painstakingly tutored four
! actresses in the art of walking like
I Sherlock Holmes. This was in con
j junction with an entr'acte patter
j song involving three different sets
i of characters all singing about how
j they, personally, were poing to get
| a million dollars.
During the scene one oi the actors,
| in response to a muffled roar from
[ the back of the house, queried,
J "Whaddayamet:nâ€”diction or projec-
I tion?" The voice floated back.
["'Can't hear' means projection;
[ 'Can't understand' means diction."
"Oh," said the actor, and imme
j diately a buzz-saw started oil back
| stage, with the result that only
j Shakespeare-voiced Ash Wilson was
audible. Even Aubrey Austin,
J though his gestures, as usual, were
J graphic, gave the appearance of a
[ man talking over the crime with the
| little man who wasn't there.
But despite the problems of put
| ting a show together for the first
j time, it looks like it's going to be a
! swell show.
