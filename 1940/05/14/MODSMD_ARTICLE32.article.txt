It must take a lot of intestinal
fortitude for a paper to make this
remark:
"Louis Zamperini. left, Univer
sity of Southern California's stellar
mile, last night came out of a
slump to score an impressive vic
tory over Paul Moore of Stanford
iu the mile run of the medley re
lay in the 14th annual West Coast
Relay* . .
Ths was part of the underline of
a two-column picture showing Zam
perini and Clyde Jeffrey as "star
performers" on the front page of a
Fresno daily the morning follow
ing the relays.

JUST LIKE Southern California
timers, who won't give the men
from Northern California any credit
when they run fast sprints because
they like to "slow-clock" them, this
Fresno paper, according to a Farm
alumnus who sent in the above
clipping, does its best to minimize
Stanford performances whether it
be football or track.
Zamperini's performance was
labeled "impressive" because he
heat Moore by inches, but the
writer must have forgotten that
Moore was all of 2!) yards behind
Zamp when he started on the mile
leg of the relay. He must have
been sleeping when Moore pulled
even with Zamp 011 the third lap
— a job which would have been
impossible for the great Zamp to
have done had he been in the
same predicament.
Moore forgot all about Zamp's be
ing so far out in front, and was
smart enough a runner to remem
ber Bill Ellington's instructions not
to yet panicky and make the first
lap a race, as Zamp had hoped
Moore would be foolish enough to
do.
TIIIS CAPTION doesn't even
give Moore credit lor making a
thrilling race out of what looked
like a sure Trojan victory. Those
persons in the stands knew that
Moore deserved a lot of praise, be
cause they gave him a good hand
when he walked back toward the
Stanford bench.
It's a funny thing about a crowd,
for they love a winner whether
he's an opponent or local boy—es
pecially when he runs the kind of
race Moore put 011 for the Fres
nans.
But it's funnier yet when a sports
writer will let his dislike of Stanford
get the best of him so that he can't
even put in a complimentary word
about the greatest miler on the Pa
cific Coast today.
In professional sports it's a nat
ural thing for a sports scribe to
boost or tear down performances,
but that idea doesn't fit in with
amateur activities. The amateur
asks nothing but credit where it
is due.
THE TROJANS' brain trust has a
pretty good scheme to test their foot
ballers in the spring to see how much
gridiron knowledge they have salted
away in practice.
They have the Elmer Bromley
intelligence trophy, which is given
to the footballer who has the
highest mark 011 a written exami
nation made out by the Trojan
coaches. Sal Mena, senior, end.
won the award last week.
The quiz included 30 questions on
football strategy, and 50 plays which
the student had to outline. It sounds
like something Coach Shaughnessy
could spring on the boys in June to
see how much they can remember
about his intricate system.

COACH SHAUGHNESSY has set
June 1 as the day for the "Field
Day" when the gridders will go on
public exhibition in the Stadium.
The "Day" replaces the usual spring
practice football game between the
Reds and Whites.
A popular plan adopted by lots
of universities when they shut
down spring practice, it will have
men competing for awards in
kicking, blocking, tackling, pass
ing, and running. In the passing
bracket it will be for both distance
and accuracy, while awards will go
also for pass catching.
Linemen, who usually don't get a
great deal of credit, will vie for the
fastest man in getting out of the
line and blocking a dummy. This
way, no one will know what Coach
Shaughnessy's system is going to
look like; they'll have to wait until
the U.S.F. game next September.
