# Indian Poloists Drop Second Tilt to U.S.C.
## 
### 
Stanford dropped the second game
of the U.S.C. polo series Saturday,
8-6, the Indians failing to avenge
their 15-7 loss suffered last month.
Leonard YVeisenburg copped high
point honors with 4 and Stan Decker
rang up 3 for the Trojans.
High taxes and restriction of gaso
line have forced off the road nearly
a million English cars.
