Sherman Selix won his fifth straight game of the season yesterday, as
,'ie gave up three runs to the Phi Kappa Sigma nine while his mates
pounded the ball for 12. Selix, who has one of the fastest pitches seen
on intramural diamonds, is the outstanding pitcher of the current season
and may well lead the Breakers to a championship.

The Fijis piled up nine runs
the first four innings and then hung 1
on behind the effective hurling of I
Felix Stapleton to down Theta Chi |
10-4. Both pitchers worked well on
the mound, but Mort Manson of the j
losers was wild in the fourth and was j
clubbed for 6 runs. A late Theta I
Chi rally in the seventh was choked I
off by a fast Fiji double play.
The Alpha Kappa Lambda nine
stayed in the winning column yes
terday by pounding out a free hit
ting 11-8 win over El Campo. In the
only other softball game of the af
ternoon, Theta Delta Chi smashed I
out a 12-7 win over the Kappa !
Alpha's.
In the first hardball game of the 1
season, the Kappa Sigs pulled a mild I
upset by downing the Delta Upsilon :
team 5-2. A D.U. uprising in the 1
sitxh inning was stopped after two j
runs and the D.U.'s didn't threaten
again.
