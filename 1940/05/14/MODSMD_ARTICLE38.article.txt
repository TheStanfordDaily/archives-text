# Water Poloists Wallop Alumni

### 
Water polo fans got their first
peek at the 11J40 varsity this 'â– 
week-end when Nort Thornton's
boys were turned loose on an
alumni team in a 10-niinute scrim
mage at the opening of Palo Alto's
new municipal pool Saturday af
ternoon. The alumni, composed of
last year's stars, lost 2-1.
A flock of frosh stars headed by 1
Captain Johnny Hauerwass are ex- j
pected to push the veterans this
season and Coach Thornton thinks [
the team will be better balanced {
with more team work than last sea
son, although there will be a con
spicuous absence of all-star play- j
ers.
Jack Bleecker, Ralph Boles, Tex |
Ritter, and Goalie Jack Behr are j
other '43 candidates for the Indian
varsity.
The team is working out daily now [
with 40 minutes of fundamentals and j
40 minutes' scrimmage. The spring |
session will wind up with the alumni
game on May 24 and the interclass
clashes the same week.
