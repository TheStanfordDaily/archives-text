## 
### United Press 
hTe New York Giants hung up
their sixth consecutive victory
yesterday, whipping the Boston
Bees 11-5 behind the rescue hurl
ing of Harry Gumbert.
The Giants tightened their hold on
third place in the National League
as Frank Demaree drove in three
runs with a first-inning homer. Hy
Vandenburg started i'or New York
but needed help from Gumbert, who
pitched the last five innings to get
credit for the win.
Despite three home runs by
Johnny Mize, Cincinnati came from
behind to earn an 8-8 tie with the
Cardinals in a game called at the end
of 14 innings because of darkness.
The deadlock left the Reds a half
game in front of Brooklyn, as the
Dodgers scored a 6-3 win over the
Phillies. Manager Leo Durocher
paced Brooklyn's attack with a per
fect day at the plate. Vito Tamulis
got credit for the win after reliev
ing Hugh Casey in the fifth.
Bill Terry has the Giants rolling
once again and New York is now
firmly entrenched in the first divi
sion. Anti-Yank feeling has in
creased the attendance at the Polo
Grounds and the success of the old
rivals in Brooklyn has pepped up the
Giants' season. Harry Gumbert's
win was his third of the year.
