# Indians to Assault Own Two-mile Relay Record
## 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Four Cardinal half-mlers will be out gunning for their own team's
intercollegiate two-mile relay record this coming week-end in the Finnish
Relief meet to he held in Los Angeles.
The time of 7:37.7, set in the lirst annual California-Stanford Relays
by Mushy Girard, Paul Moore, Jack Moore, and Burman Skrable, was a

new intercollegiate record. A
ly revised edition of this team will
make the assault in the Finnish Meet 1
in an effort to make a dent in the
record books for the fourth time this
yeai by Stanford cindermen.
The team will be anchored by the
unbeatable Paul Moore and will In- \
elude little Jack Moore, who showed
his heels in this same two-mile re- j
lay to Louie Zamperini during the
Fresno Relays. Blair Hyde will fill i
in for the injured Mush Girard and >
either Ernie Clark or Burman Skra- I
ble will round out the quartet.
Paul Moore is capable of 1:52.5 or
even better, Blair Hyde of 1:53.5, I
Ernie Clark of 1:54, Jack Moore also j
of about J:54, and the fast improv
ing Skrable of about 1:55. With
either Clark or Skrable running, the
Cards' lour times add up to around
7:35, which would easily eclipse the
standing mark.
GIRARD STILL RUNS
Contrary to many reports, Mushy j
Girard is not through for the season.
Though he plainly showed the ill ef
fects of his bad leg and lay-off in
the medley relay down at Fresno, he
worked out yesterday and claims
that his leg no longer hurts.
In early season time trials and
meets he and Paul Moore ran but a
yard or two apart in almost every
race. Therefore, if Mush returns to
the top condition he was in around
March, he ought to become the sec- j
ond best collegiate miler in the j
countryâ€”just a stride behind team- ,
mate Paul.
Coach Bill Ellington was glad- !
dened by the return of his prize
hurdler, Sid Hayes, to the track yes
terday. Because of his fine times ;
last year, Bill says Sid ought to win
the Pacific Coast Conference high
hurdle race two weeks from now.
