# Yankee Chief Denies Rumor
## 
### GEORGE KIRSKEY 
NEW YORK, May 13 (UP). â€”
Potpourri:
Ed Barrow says the Yankees
win not bring in either Gerry
Priddv or Phil Riz/.uto from their
Kansas City farm club to bol
ster the slumping world's cham
pions, ....
Reports had been circulated that
Priddv would be brought in and
; placed at second with Joe Gordon
| shifting to shortstop. . . . With Billy
| Knickerbocker at sh<frt the day the
i Yanks broke their 8-game losing
streak, it seems likely Frankie Cro
setti will warm the bench for a
while . . .
Larry MacPhail says Brooklyn
will not win the pennant and re
-1 fuses to-get excited about the Dodg
ers' fast start ... he still rates the
Reds and Cards as stronger clubs
than the Dodgers . . . When Frankie
j Friseh asked Dizzy Dean why he
| didn't throw his fast ball any more,
; Diz replied, "Not at these prices,
J Frankie."
Lou Finney attributes his im
; provement in hitting to a change in
! bats and batting style. . . . After
joining the Red Sox last season Fin
| ney had a new bat designed from
: the Max Bishop model and then eop
i ied Ted Williams' hitting style as
near as possible. . . . Finney's hit
ting is keeping Dom DiMaggio on
! the Red Sox bench.
