# Most Worthy of All

rrOIM\ S Daily carries a rather large advertise
ment regarding the five per cent rebates which
I lie Bookstore is planning to pay the latter part of
this month.
\ll purchase slips, to he eligible for the refunds,
must he dropped in containers at the Bookstore by
tomorrow afternoon.
I ii(|ueslional)ly a great many slips have already
been turned in for this "bonus'; unquestionably
some of the Bookstore's best student customers
will hase a handy and useful check ready for them
by the end of the month. The value of that check
will naturally fluctuate in ratio to the individuals
own financial need. Anyone with a prospect of five
to ten dollars in view and a slim financial reserve
on hand to finish this sometimes expensive spring
quarter has probably spent this new budget credit
already.
I he message of this column is addressed to those
hundreds whose rebates will average a good deal
less than the cost of a double drink at Del Monte.
Tin *\ are the ones from whom Ihe Daily is asking
contributions for the Student Aid Fund.
As has been stated often before, Student Aid has
lust all its principal sources of revenue. A Fund that
formerly paid the quarterly tuition of some fifty
men and women, athletes and non-athletes alike, on
the basis of their records and need alone, is sched
uled for virtual abandonment unless an appreciative
student body and the Bookstore directors are willing
Â»
lo rcfosliT the movement.
Despite the fact that their policy almost decrees
the ]> a \ men I of a rebate, the Directors have intimated
that they are willing to apply all uncalled-for re
bate allowances to the Student Aid Fund. What
they want now is further indications from their
patrons regarding the use of their surpluses.
All purchase lags marked "Student Aid" or just
"S.A.I', have already been set up in a Fund ac
count; there is a strong likelihood, too, that all the
profits remaining for the rest of the year will be
gi\en to Student Aid.
Student leaders of both the Hall and How are
whole-heartedly behind this idea that keeps some
<>l Stanford's outstanding students in school. The
rest of the campus can follow suit by adopting these
plans that will give a new life to the undisputed
champion of all Stanford's "causes":
1. Mark all Bookstore tags for the rest of your
collegiate career with the simple phrase "Student
Aid."
2. hndorse rebate checks over lo the Fund; or
3. Let the I bookstore Directors know you are
behind Student Aid by refusing to apply for the re
bate or call for your check.
