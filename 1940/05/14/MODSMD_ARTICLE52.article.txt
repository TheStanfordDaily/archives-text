# CAMPUS OPINION
## LOOK WHO'S HERE 
### 
r pHE F.DITOR, SIH:
I personally think th;it the Hoover Library
should be made taller, while they are still working on
it, than the Campanile over at Berkeley; then we
could keep it. One way that this could be done, I

think, is to buy from the Soviet Government the
statue that stood atop the U.S.S.R. building at the
New York Fair and put it on the war libe. It repre
sented a working man (i.e., "rough") and people would
soon forget its previous associations. It was called
"Big Joe," I believe, but this could be changed (to ?)
without much trouble. Of course we would have to
take the star from its raised hand but we could easily
substitute an apple, or a football, or an elephant;
anything would do. Don't you think this is rather a
good suggestion? Perhaps you might start a cam
paign or something.
My boy friend, he's a Row man you know, wrote to
me the other day to say that they might soon be hav
ing house mothers in the fraternities. He didn't seem
very pleased about it, but he's funny about things like
that, anyway. Sort of consex-vative, you know. I
think it is a splendid idea. I am sure that* most of
the boys miss the home influence, and a house mother
would just fill in that gap.

HPHEY could go to her with their troubles and prob
lems and find in her a ready sympathizer. She
would care for them when they were feeling low or
ill, and would cheer them up. To show how neces
sary they are let me give you an example.
Before I left I was out with a boy called Bob Mule
ton. I think he is a Zete. Anyway he was telling me
how lonely he was and how he wished he had some
one to look after him. In fact, he wanted me t* go
back with him then, because, he said, he "wanted some
one to mother" him. Isn't that sweet? Why shouldn't
a home-loving lad like this have someone to go to
when he misses his home. What better argument is
there for house mothers?
I can think of nothing that I would like better
than being a fraternity house mother, but of course I
am a little young to think of anything like that, yet.
Well, I really must close now, but I will write again
soon. Let the Row be "Home from Home."

"Big Joe," I believe, but this could be changed (to ?)
without much trouble. Of course we would have to
take the star from its raised hand but we could easily
substitute an apple, or a football, or an elephant;
anything would do. Don't you think this is rather a
good suggestion? Perhaps you might start a cam
paign or something.
My boy friend, he's a Row man you know, wrote to
me the other day to say that they might soon be hav
ing house mothers in the fraternities. He didn't seem
very pleased about it, but he's funny about things like
that, anyway. Sort of consex-vative, you know. I
think it is a splendid idea. I am sure that* most of
the boys miss the home influence, and a house mother
would just fill in that gap.

HPHEY could go to her with their troubles and prob
lems and find in her a ready sympathizer. She
would care for them when they were feeling low or
ill, and would cheer them up. To show how neces
sary they are let me give you an example.
Before I left I was out with a boy called Bob Mule
ton. I think he is a Zete. Anyway he was telling me
how lonely he was and how he wished he had some
one to look after him. In fact, he wanted me t* go
back with him then, because, he said, he "wanted some
one to mother" him. Isn't that sweet? Why shouldn't
a home-loving lad like this have someone to go to
when he misses his home. What better argument is
there for house mothers?
I can think of nothing that I would like better
than being a fraternity house mother, but of course I
am a little young to think of anything like that, yet.
Well, I really must close now, but I will write again
soon. Let the Row be "Home from Home."

I personally think th;it the Hoover Library
should be made taller, while they are still working on
it, than the Campanile over at Berkeley; then we
could keep it. One way that this could be done, I

think, is to buy from the Soviet Government the
statue that stood atop the U.S.S.R. building at the
New York Fair and put it on the war libe. It repre
sented a working man (i.e., "rough") and people would
soon forget its previous associations. It was called
