### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
PACK UP YOUR TROUBLES . . .
A s , yesterday's Daily and a host of Washington-bent
telegrams showed, the Stanford campus is a
trifle ired about, the attitude of American statesmen
on the War. Stanford is rightly alarmed; we are
afraid that an unneutral spirit will again be the har
binger of military participation.
But there is one happy factor in the whole ugly
situation which some of us seem to have overlooked.
That is, the practical value to the average college stu
dent of state-coquetry with war.
Every time one of our nation's leaders makes an
other overture to the Allies, Stanford students become
more carefree. If I will be facing bullets in a year,
they reason, why should I study today? And one must
admit that the rationalization has its points. What an
thropologist can differentiate between an educated and
an uneducated corpse? And what corpse would give
a damn if the anthropologist could? One feels safe in
asserting that the answer to both of those questions
is "none, absolutely none."
And not only do the dubious worries of studying
melt away like a Spring Quarter mist in the sun of
impending war. All worries, whether they be per
sonal, social, or moral, vanish in the anticipated strains
of "Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag and
smile, smile, smile!"
* * *
J MAY go down 10,000 points in bridge at a tenth
tenth of a cent a point. (In fact, I probably will.)
I may court disaster in my automobile. I may ease my
sell off the boat with some lovely red head, through
a series of under- and oversights. But I can afford to
be a stoic, a stoic without a dour side, because what
does it all matter? What can these little things amount
to when I will soon be care-protected in a trench,
with a girl-lure uniform and ribbons in my cap?
That is not., mind you, how I feel right now. But
if America continues to sidle away from the straight
and narrow path, the great, rationalization will come.
I will be gay as a butterfly. I will be brave as a
lion. I will fear no exes, nor tremble before the awful
majesty of my lady's scowl. The slings and arrows of
outraged drivers will never pierce the armor of my
sunny optimism.
All I will have to worry about will be dismember
ment and death on a battlefield in France. And every
one knows what a gay place France is.

Every time one of our nation's leaders makes an
other overture to the Allies, Stanford students become
more carefree. If I will be facing bullets in a year,
they reason, why should I study today? And one must
admit that the rationalization has its points. What an
thropologist can differentiate between an educated and
an uneducated corpse? And what corpse would give
a damn if the anthropologist could? One feels safe in
asserting that the answer to both of those questions
is "none, absolutely none."
And not only do the dubious worries of studying
melt away like a Spring Quarter mist in the sun of
impending war. All worries, whether they be per
sonal, social, or moral, vanish in the anticipated strains
of "Pack up your troubles in your old kit bag and
smile, smile, smile!"

J MAY go down 10,000 points in bridge at a tenth
tenth of a cent a point. (In fact, I probably will.)
I may court disaster in my automobile. I may ease my
sell off the boat with some lovely red head, through
a series of under- and oversights. But I can afford to
be a stoic, a stoic without a dour side, because what
does it all matter? What can these little things amount
to when I will soon be care-protected in a trench,
with a girl-lure uniform and ribbons in my cap?
That is not., mind you, how I feel right now. But
if America continues to sidle away from the straight
and narrow path, the great, rationalization will come.
I will be gay as a butterfly. I will be brave as a
lion. I will fear no exes, nor tremble before the awful
majesty of my lady's scowl. The slings and arrows of
outraged drivers will never pierce the armor of my
sunny optimism.
All I will have to worry about will be dismember
ment and death on a battlefield in France. And every
one knows what a gay place France is.
PACK UP YOUR TROUBLES . . .
A s , yesterday's Daily and a host of Washington-bent
telegrams showed, the Stanford campus is a
trifle ired about, the attitude of American statesmen
on the War. Stanford is rightly alarmed; we are
afraid that an unneutral spirit will again be the har
binger of military participation.
But there is one happy factor in the whole ugly
situation which some of us seem to have overlooked.
That is, the practical value to the average college stu
dent of state-coquetry with war.
