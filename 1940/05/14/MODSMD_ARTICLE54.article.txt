66TÂ¥OW muhc athletic talent is going to waste here
at Stanford?"
This question came to my mind the other after
noon as I watched an intramural track meet on An
gell Field. Although a good many of the competitors
were wondering, at the conclusion of their races,
why they had eaten so much for lunch, there were sev
eral very capable looking runners who never had re
ported to the track coaches. It was very easy for me
to visualize a number of these men as point winners
on the varsity squad, if they had had a little coaching
and conditioning.
As a matter of fact, in my wanderings about the
campus, I have seen many athletic looking men who
have never tried out for any squad. In this connec
tion, it is well to remember that Stanford is out-num
bered from two to five to one, in man power, by most
of the universities she meets on the athletic field. So,
it is imperative that we get 100 out of the men avail
able.
It. is possible, but not probable that there are some
Norm Standlecs, Frank Alberts, Hugh Gallarneaus,
Cootie Thompsons, Ken Davidsons, Don Williams's,
Paul Moores, Stan Andersens, Clyde Jeffreys, Larry
Dees, or Roy Vitouseks, wandering around the cam
pus wondering what to do with their spare time. How
ever. stars alone do not make winning teams. Lack
of depth has cost Stanford many a victoryâ€”one as re
cently as May 4 when the Indians won nine of fifteen
first places in their dual track meet with Southern
California but bowed to superior depth and lost by a
score of 59 2-3 to 71 1-3. Two more second places
would have cinched that meet and if there were any
way of proving it. we would wager that there are men
on the campus who could have taken those six points
and more if they had reported for track when they
first, arrived at Stanford.
We haven't the space to attemtp to analyze the
reasons for this condition but we can suggest a cure.
Let every able-bodied freshman at Stanford turn out
for some athletic team (there are some 14 from which
to choose). It's true that only a small percentage of
the men who report, could become stars or even regu
lars in their chosen sports. However, we'll venture the
guess that a check-up will reveal the fact that those
members of athletic squads who seldom get into games
derive just as much fun. satisfaction, and benefit out
of their associations as the boys whose names you
read in headlines.
Upperclassmen can take the lead in this movement
bv encouraging freshmen and sophomores to look over
the list of sports, choose the one in which they are
most interested and for which they are l>est suited, then
go out and sivc it a real try.
