# Latin-America Supplies Topic For Acuna Art
## 
### 
Paintings and drawings by Luis
Alberto Acuna, now on exhibit at
the San Francisco Museum of Art,
through May 2(>.
Connoisseur or layman, there's
something for you here. This exhibit
of 40 drawings and paintings by
Acuna, 36-year-old Colombian and
one of South America's ranking art
ists, is exciting and interesting, both
in subject and execution.
Acuna is an exponent of an art
that has only recently come into
prominence—the art of Central and
South America, which is now be
ginning to shake off previous strong
European influence and take on dis
tinctly Latin-American characteris
tics. This show, his first -one-man
exhibit in the United States, is a
prelude to an extensive collection of
South American painting which will
be on display at the Golden Gate
Exposition this year.
HUMOROUS TITLES
One of the first things that strikes
the gallery-goer is Acuna's good
humored joshing of the Old Masters.
In his "Four Ladies, a Child, and a
Background—All Very Baroque," is
seen an engaging parody of Rubens'
"Three Graces." Rubens was noted
for his fleshy ladies, arranged with
out benefit of drapery in lush land
scapes. Well, Acuna's "Four Ladies,
etc." touches this all off nicely.
Painted in his clear, solid, lucid
style, he shows us four very healthy
gals with foreshortened toes; all very
baroque.
His humor extends into the catchy
titles on his genre pieces. "Three
Horses and Nothing More," "Por
trait of an Unimportant Woman,"
and "Hags' Meeting" are calculated
to make you look twice. The titles
enhance, rather than label, the paint
ings.
FRESH APPROACH
Acuna's approach is fresh, his
draftsmanship impeccable. He builds
his forms very solidly, giving a peas
anty appearance even to the por
traits of South American gods. His
children are charming, short, stocky
little guys, with prehensile fingers!
and blunt toes, kicking about in the
dust, or going to market with mama,
or playing a fiute while leaning non
chalantly against a burx'o.
The color is bright, refreshing, and
seems to glow with an inward ra
diance. The bodies of his nudes
have a bronzy effect, which height
ens their sculptural qualities
The paintings and chalk drawings
are divided into religious works
(South American myth), genre stuff,
portrait, allegory and fantasy, and
landscape. And one or two more
defy classification. His subject ver
satility is amazing—he treats each
in the same clear, sharp, descriptive
manner.
VARIETY OF SUBJECTS
But if you see this, you'll see In
dian gods; mythological creatures (he
calls 'em "phantasmagoria"); graph
ic, simple Colombian landscapes,
painted with a maximum of broad
color; solid Indian portraits, show
ing a character that will awe you;
and a raft of colorful things like the
baroque ladies.
Incidentally, in the next two rooms
at either end of the Acuna exhibit,
is an exhibit of 19 drawings by
George Grosz, the bitter, powerful
social cartoonist. These drawings
are all dated around 1917, which
appears to have been the height of
his disillusionment, and are conse
quently very sordid bits of German
life. Thomas Craven terms him "the
most explicit and pitiless satirist of
the social habits of man since
Swift."
This exhibit is representative of
his more pleasant moments, how
ever, and you'll see only a couple of
street fights and a "Suicide by
Drowning," decorated with Grosz's
inevitable collection of besotted
German grotesques, prostitutes, and
legless veterans.—Burtt

His humor extends into the catchy
titles on his genre pieces. "Three
Horses and Nothing More," "Por
trait of an Unimportant Woman,"
and "Hags' Meeting" are calculated
to make you look twice. The titles
enhance, rather than label, the paint
ings.
FRESH APPROACH
Acuna's approach is fresh, his
draftsmanship impeccable. He builds
his forms very solidly, giving a peas
anty appearance even to the por
traits of South American gods. His
children are charming, short, stocky
little guys, with prehensile fingers!
and blunt toes, kicking about in the
dust, or going to market with mama,
or playing a fiute while leaning non
chalantly against a burx'o.
The color is bright, refreshing, and
seems to glow with an inward ra
diance. The bodies of his nudes
have a bronzy effect, which height
ens their sculptural qualities
The paintings and chalk drawings
are divided into religious works
(South American myth), genre stuff,
portrait, allegory and fantasy, and
landscape. And one or two more
defy classification. His subject ver
satility is amazing—he treats each
in the same clear, sharp, descriptive
manner.
VARIETY OF SUBJECTS
But if you see this, you'll see In
dian gods; mythological creatures (he
calls 'em "phantasmagoria"); graph
ic, simple Colombian landscapes,
painted with a maximum of broad
color; solid Indian portraits, show
ing a character that will awe you;
and a raft of colorful things like the
baroque ladies.
Incidentally, in the next two rooms
at either end of the Acuna exhibit,
is an exhibit of 19 drawings by
George Grosz, the bitter, powerful
social cartoonist. These drawings
are all dated around 1917, which
appears to have been the height of
his disillusionment, and are conse
quently very sordid bits of German
life. Thomas Craven terms him "the
most explicit and pitiless satirist of
the social habits of man since
Swift."
This exhibit is representative of
his more pleasant moments, how
ever, and you'll see only a couple of
street fights and a "Suicide by
Drowning," decorated with Grosz's
inevitable collection of besotted
German grotesques, prostitutes, and
legless veterans.—Burtt
Paintings and drawings by Luis
Alberto Acuna, now on exhibit at
the San Francisco Museum of Art,
through May 2(>.
Connoisseur or layman, there's
something for you here. This exhibit
of 40 drawings and paintings by
Acuna, 36-year-old Colombian and
one of South America's ranking art
ists, is exciting and interesting, both
in subject and execution.
Acuna is an exponent of an art
that has only recently come into
prominence—the art of Central and
South America, which is now be
ginning to shake off previous strong
European influence and take on dis
tinctly Latin-American characteris
tics. This show, his first -one-man
exhibit in the United States, is a
prelude to an extensive collection of
South American painting which will
be on display at the Golden Gate
Exposition this year.
HUMOROUS TITLES
One of the first things that strikes
the gallery-goer is Acuna's good
humored joshing of the Old Masters.
In his "Four Ladies, a Child, and a
Background—All Very Baroque," is
seen an engaging parody of Rubens'
"Three Graces." Rubens was noted
for his fleshy ladies, arranged with
out benefit of drapery in lush land
scapes. Well, Acuna's "Four Ladies,
etc." touches this all off nicely.
Painted in his clear, solid, lucid
style, he shows us four very healthy
gals with foreshortened toes; all very
baroque.
His humor extends into the catchy
titles on his genre pieces. "Three
Horses and Nothing More," "Por
trait of an Unimportant Woman,"
and "Hags' Meeting" are calculated

Incidentally, in the next two rooms
at either end of the Acuna exhibit,
is an exhibit of 19 drawings by
George Grosz, the bitter, powerful
social cartoonist. These drawings
are all dated around 1917, which
appears to have been the height of
his disillusionment, and are conse
quently very sordid bits of German
life. Thomas Craven terms him "the
most explicit and pitiless satirist of
the social habits of man since
Swift."
This exhibit is representative of
his more pleasant moments, how
ever, and you'll see only a couple of
street fights and a "Suicide by
Drowning," decorated with Grosz's
inevitable collection of besotted
German grotesques, prostitutes, and
legless veterans.—Burtt
