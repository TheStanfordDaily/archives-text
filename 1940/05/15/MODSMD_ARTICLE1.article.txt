### WILSON CANNON 
'JMIE old "darkest before the dawn"
cliche must start working soon
if it is going to prove its truth to
the Allies.
In Europe, along a tangent stretch
ing from German-won Norway,
through the Low Countries, and
down the northernmost portion of
the Maginot Line, a surging Nazi
horde claims victory after victory.
War measures being rushed to
completion in England are generally
along defensive lines. French fore
heads creased with worry as a Ger
man spearhead pushed through
their $500,000,000 Maginot Line.
Towns 10 miles within French terri
tory have been reported taken.
Holland fell beneath slashing Ger
man air raids. The green-grey horde
entered The Hague yesterday, only
five days after the Reich opened ac
tion against the kingdom of Queen
Wilhelmina.
(Which makes the Hitler war ma
chine comparatively three times
more powerful than the juggernaut
of Kaiser Wilhelm. In 1914 troops
of the Kaiser took 16 days to con
quer Belgian defenders.)
All available men in Belgium
were called to the defense of the
desperately stricken country. Bel
gian lines were kept at near per
fect order, but only at an incal
culable loss of life and equipment.
From Germany, press reports
warned of Nazi preparations for the
most gigantic air armada in the his
tory of the world. From 0,000 to
7,000 Reich planes were in threat
ened readiness. Pilots held un
opened orders . . . but all knew that
ihe objective would be the clearing
of a path through to Paris.

A QUESTIONING America last
night heard President Roose
velt indicate that he would soon ask
Congress for a large sum for na
tional defense. Showing the strain
of continuous defense conferences,
the President, warned the problem
of raising the money was nothing in
comparison with the urgency of
putting the dollars to work.
"The country must have a fleet
capable of going anywhere at any
time," Mr. Roosevelt warned the na
tion. "No man knows when or
where it will have to go.
Significant of White House anxiety
were reflections on two other fronts.
1. The United States notified 20
oilier Western Hemisphere repub
lics that it will stand with them in
protesting Germany's invasion of
the Low Countries. The move was
initiated by Uruguay.
Mr. Roosevelt claimed this latter
move was merely part of a sweep
ing plan to remove nationals from
the war areas. He said it was no in
dication that this country contem
plates Italy's immediate participa
tion in the war.

r pHROUGHOUT America, as in
the remainder of the neutral
world, speculation was rife on Nazi
operations during the next two
weeks of World War 11.
Most international fact-jugglers
were of the opinion that new Ger
man gains in the Low Countries
would be the hub for thrusts into
England and into France.
Although Switzerland was promi
nently mentioned, most were of the
opinion that Hitler will halt his jug
gernaut short of the Swiss borders.
At least for the time being.
Military minds considered the
following objectives most feasible for
the German torrent:
1. A slashing blow, through the
air, directed at Paris. Nazi air
fleets are now based only 125 miles
from the French capital. Flying
distance is a matter of a half an
hour. Necessary gas loads may be
sacrificed for tons of explosives.
2. An air attack upon England.
This is now possible because of Low
Country victories. No foreign army
has set foot on British soil since
10(>(>â€”but 1340 may usher in a new
era.
3. An attempt to annihilate the
British fleet by the combined force
of every air division within the
Reich. A German success here would
virtually end the war.
