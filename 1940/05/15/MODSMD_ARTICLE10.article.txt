# Farm Speakers Discuss Isolation
## 
### 
"Shall the United States Isolate
! Itself from Foreign Wars?" Lin
Moses and Robert Newell discussed
the isolationist issue before the Men's
Club of Christ Episcopal Church in
Alameda last night.
Speaking in open forum, the Stan
ford students answered questions
from the floor after each spoke 25
minutes on both the negative and
affirmative sides of the issue. Moses
and Newell were guests at a ban
quet preceding the discussion.
Newell and Moses recently won
the Commonwealth plaque in a de
bate against U.C.L.A. on the same
i issue. At that time the Stanford de
j baters upheld the negative of the
j United States war isolation question.
1 Farm debaters maintained that the
I United States should not follow a
j strict military and economic isolation
j policy in the Western Hemisphere.
