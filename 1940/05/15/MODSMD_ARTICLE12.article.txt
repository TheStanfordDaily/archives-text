# Excom Talks Streamlined Home Drive
## Members Consider $4,500 Drop in Last Four Years' Intake 
### DICK DUDMAN 
A sick Convalescent Home Drive,
ailing for the last four years and
beginning now to bleed a little at
.the ears, was eyed pityingly by a.
compassionate Ex Committee last
night.
Administering a local anesthetic,
committeemen prodded their pa
tient in an effort to diagnose the
malady that has caused drive re
ceipts to drop from nearly $8,000 to
an estimated $3,500 in the last four
years.
Drive Chairman Ned Pugh and
Publicity Chairman Jerry Mayer
were there with some suggestions for
changes in next year's drive. Other
proposals were made by various
committeemen.
SUB COMMITTEE NAMED
To integrate the suggestions into
a schedule for next year, a sub
committee consisting of Mollie West,
Bill Rapp, and Barney Ferguson
was appointed to meet with a com
mittee of Cardinals. The final plan
is to be presented later this quarter
for Ex Committee approval.
Following are the chief sugges
tions offered during the evening:
1. Combine Convalescent Home
Drive with Back-to-the-Farm Week.
2. Revive the king-queen con
test, discontinued three years ago
because it was "undemocratic."
3. Shift on-campus drive (direct
contributions from students) to fall
quarter.
5. Shift the drive to the first part
of spring quarter.
6. Climax the drive with a "wom
en's choice" dance.
7. Institute a "terrific" barn dance,
complete with booths.
8. Shift spring quarter schedule
so drive will precede student body
elections.
WEST SUGGESTS CAUSE
Disagreement as to what lias
caused the drive's slump colored the
whole discussion.
Sylvia Berry said she thought the
chief trouble was that the drive
came "right in the middle of mid
quarters."
Mollie West suggested a cause of
the trouble was inertia on the part
of on-campus drive collectors. (This
was the part of the drive that
slumped most seriously this year —
$1200 last year, $600 this year.)
MAYER'S OPINION
Mayer said there wex - e too many
counter attractions, drawing atten
tion and money from the on-cam
pus drive. Also, he said, the Con
valescent Home Drive follows so
many other appeals for funds that
it loses its effectiveness.
"By spring quarter, students have
been hit so often they develop an
immunity toward it," he said.
FAVORS CONTEST
Larry Livingston, visitor to the
meeting, spoke briefly in favor of
the king-queen contest as a money
raiser. He said the real reason for
its abolition in 1936 was not its un
democratic aspects, but the undesir
able publicity for the University that
resulted from a kidnaping, sky
writing, and an elephant's being rid
den up and down the Row as an ad
vertising stunt for one of the candi
dates.

women were disappointed in not be
