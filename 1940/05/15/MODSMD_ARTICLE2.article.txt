# Spring Show To Feature Patter-tunes
## 'Strangler' Numbers Offer Variety; Play Opens Friday Night 
### JEAN NOWELL 
A break-down of song statistics
for this year's Spring Show, "I'm a
Strangler Here Myself," scheduled
to hit the Memorial Hall boards on
Friday and Saturday nights, shows
the patter-song leading in a clear
field.
Six of the Gilbert and Sullivan
esque ditties as against three bal
lads, a torrid swing number, and a
finale make up the tally of tunes
which will be used in the Bulotti-
Muheim-Zelver musical comedy on
violent death in a university, coinci
dentally named "Sandstone Arches
U."
A couple of carefully guarded
secrets are lurking in this mass of
musical numbers. Something suc
cinctly termed "Surprise Number" is
to be sung by Harry Muheim and
Nancy BehJke; all that's known
about it is that it is by Muheim, Bud
Cady, Charlie Bulotti and "some
other Italian." Also a bit cryptic is
the comment on "While We Go
Marching to Steele's House."
PATTER TUNES
"Lyrics by Bulotti and Muheim,"
they say. "Tune unknown."
Other patter-tunes include: "Oh,
How I Hate College Students," sung
by Professor Steele; "Oh, How We
Plate That Guy Steele," sung by the
students; "Has Anybody Seen a
Clue?" sung by three different sets
of sleuths; and "I'd Like to Put the
Finger on You," sung by Coroner
Tommy Dee.
LOVE SONGS
"You Took Me by Storm" by Bob
Staver and Jane Thornton, "When
I First Met You" by Bob Stevens and
Judy Pope, and "This Must Be Love"
by Norton, Cady, Bulotti and Thorn
ton will take care of the musical
love stuff. "Ya Gotta Get in the
Groove" and "Split the Pot" round
out the list as "drive" number and
finale respectively.
According to Bulotti the one dance
number will be "a sort of a square
dance with very modern variations."
Scats for both performances are
priced at $1.00, 75 cents, and 50 cents.
