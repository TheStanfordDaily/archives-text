# Holland's Capitulation Puts Nazis Plane Base Half-hour from London
## English People Fear German Parachutists 
### United Press 
Germany was in position Tues
day night to give terrible effect
to the Nazi war song ''We Sail
Against England" after bringing
little Holland to her knees in all
but complete surrender and smash
ing across the Western Front onto
French soil.
Holland's capitulation after flight
of its Queen and government to Eng
land placed Germany's terrifying air
force within a half - hour flight of
London, the "capital" of the British
Empire, where frantic measures arc
being taken against a possible Nazi
"invasion" by means of parachute
troops and bombers.
Nazis in Berlin said early Wed
nesday that mass air attacks against
the British Isles—the terror that
45,000.000 people of those islands
have been awaiting for eight months
—can be expected "in the nearest
future' from these Dutch bases.
The ( Germans appeared to have
cut Belgium to ribbons in another
example of the Nazi type of "Blitz
krieg." took the French town of
Sedan and pierced the French
frontier at three or four points.
Germany's mechanized forces,
striving to outflank France's
strongest forts of the Maginot Line,
were within 125 miles of Paris.
By all accounts the biggest, and
fiercest battle of this eight-month
old war was under way along a 150-
mile front reaching down through
Belgium and curving eastward along
the French frontier.
It is a battle of monsters of war
never seen in mass action before—
1,500 or 2,000 tajiks, <>,000 or 7,000
bombing and machine - gunning
planes and swarms of armored cars
and other new implements of death.
Holland's capitulation held the
greatest danger for England be
cause there arc air bases on Hol
land's North Sea coast only 175
and 185 miles from London. Brit
ain realized this imminent menace
and strove dramatically to prepare
for it.
Throughout the British Isles a
voluntary rifle corps of 100,00(1
sharpshooters, young boys and old
men, was mobilized.
There was greater tension in the
Balkans.
Russia obliquely warned Rumania
a misstep may mean war along the
frontier of Bessarabia.
The border between Hungary and
the German protectorate of Slovakia
was reported to be closed and both
countries, in high anger with each
other for weeks because of minority
disputes, were said to be massing
troops and calling up reservists.
