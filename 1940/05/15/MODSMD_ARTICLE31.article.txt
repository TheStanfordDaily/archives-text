backs sincc 1932. Jittery selling by
speculators and investors alike drove
the pivotal issues down $4 to $8 a
share.
Losses in the top grade stocks ex
tended to $11 a share in American
Tel. and Tel. and to nearly $19 in '
DuPont. The general market aver
age tumbled to the lowest point
since May 1. 1939.

historic days, swam by means of
four great paddle-like limbs, which
it used as oars in rowing itself along.
