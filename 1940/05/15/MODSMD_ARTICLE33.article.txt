# Stanford Sophomore Conducts Symphony in Own Composition
## 
### RUTH RICHMOND 
With the orchestra co-operating perfectly, William Bergsnta, Stanford
sophomore, conducted his own "A Set of Dances" in the Stanford Sym
phony Orchestra and Chamber Music Group concert last night. The pro
gram was presented in the Tuesday Evening Series.
In the opening number, Mozart's Overture to "The Magic Flute," the
orchestra lacked polish and finesse, but the verve with which they played

made the music delightful.
Seeming to warm up in the second
number under Ferenc Molnar's di
rection, the players smoothed minoi
parts well. The first violinist of thc
violin, 'cello, oboe, and bassoon
quartet carried his part particularly
well as the theme was picked up.
developed, and returned to the or
chestra.
The selection of these pieces from
the lighter side of the classical
school was appropriate for the Uni
versity audience.
Mendelssohn-Bartholdy's '"Allegro
moderato, ma con fuoco" was done
by an octet. Although with perhaps
too much of the same technique
used in the preceding selections,
they managed to make the soft parts
delicate and lovely. The first vio
linist carried it with intensity.
'"A Set of Dances," freely trans
cribed from John W. Moore, by
Bergsma was delightful music.
Concluding with a graceful and
satisfactory note, the orchestra gave
C. M. Weber's "Invitation to the
Dance. Opus 05."
The concert was under the direc
tion of Mr. Ferenc Molnar. Concert
master was Frederick W. Kimball,
Stanford student.
