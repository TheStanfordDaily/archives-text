SAN FRANCISCO, May 14 (UP).
â€”Contending it was not engaged in
interstate commerce, Pacific Gas &
Electric Sompany today asked the
U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals to
dismiss the National Labor Rela
tions Board order directing the
company to "cease unfair labor prac
tices" and to post notices it will not
interfere with union organization.
P.G.&E. attorneys asserted the
company was denied a fair hearing
before the NLRB, and that enforce
ment of the board order would re
quire it to coerce and interfere with
exercise by its employes of their
right to self-organization.
