A LITTLE BIT
ABOU'I NOTHING
A series of bi-weekly articles
written by Charles Evans, Jr., and
distributed by the National Colle
giate Athletic Association to publi
cations of its member universities
and colleges have been turned over
to the University library by The
Daily.
It was figured that because of
the length and space required to
ptinl them, it would be more val
uable t:> bind them and make them
available to any golf students who
may be interested in reading Mr.
Evans' instructional articles.
The N.C.2A., which sponsors the
annual collegiate golf champion
ship to which Stanford has sent
teams four of the past five years, is
extremely interested in increasing
the popularity ol golf among college
students.
1", ith this in mind, they se
cure Mr. Evans' services to write
articles both general and instruc
tional. For instance, he is now
sending out several pages a week
<in such items as "stance," "the
address," "the lofted wooden
clubs." "driving iron and cieek,"
etc.
If you golfers are at all interested,
you will f'nd these articles at the ref
erence desk of the main library.
EVERY NOW and then you hear
about some organization giving an
award o 1 nn honor to some person
who has ('r.>ne the most for a sport.
Stanford may be proud to know that
one of its coaches has been selected
for a similar honor.
That man is Rill Ellington, who
gives all the orders out on the
track. About a week ago. Bill re
ceived a letter from the commit
tee handling the Compton Invita
tional. to which Stanford will send
several representatives, letting him
know that they have selected him
as this year's "honorary referee."
Last year it was Joe Pipal, Oxy's
veteran track coach, who was hon
ored as the first "honorary referee";
and because of Bill's fine work in
bringing out the best performances
of his men this year, Compton will
honor him, June 6.
Provided Captain Clyde Jeffrey
is well enough to run his usual
anchor lap in the mile relay, the
Indians will he represented that
Friday night in the 1600-meter re
lay (practically a mile), and as
opposition a picked team from the
Southland will he brought to
gether to give them some compe
tition.
At the same time that well known
two-mile relay quartette will be
sent south to sec what they can do
about lowering their own American
record of 7:37.7—0r maybe they'll
lower it this week-end at the Finn
ish Relief meet in Los Angeles.
LET IT BE KNOWN here and
now that Bill Ellington has a job
foi next year. A San Francisco
sj.m: :n writer made the comment that
Bi!! doqsn't know what he is going
to do next year when Franklin
"Fitch" Johnson moves in to take
over the track helm.
Bill will be freshman track
coach as he was prior to his one
year appointment as head coach.
He'll also serve as a valuable aide
to Johnson in louring out the vnr
sity problems.
Rumors have had it that Drake

would like to have Ellington re
place Johnson. They figured that
way they'd get the better of the ex
change. Bill may have been con
tacted in that regard, but as yet he
has said nothing about it. However,
here's hoping that he'll be back with
Stanford next year, because who
knows but what something may hap
pen to Johnson and the B.A.C. will
need a good man to step in.
* * *
IT'S HARD to believe that Clyde
Jeffrey, the Iron-man of the track,
is out of commission. How long
he'll be in the rest home with heat
treatments on his cramped muscle,
which he hurt in the half-mile relay
at Fresno, is uncertain.
The d;:c says he might lie able to
go in the P.C.C. meet. May 25, in
Los Angeles. He is definitely out
of the Finnish Relief —that much
was known Saturday night when
Jeff was hobbling around Fresno.
With Jeffrey possibly out of the
Coast Conference meet, the Stan
iorditc>' would have only a mathe
matical chance to win that crown
lrom Troy.
If he is pronounced okay, we
hope that Jeff's doctors are cer
tain that his leg won't go out on
him and ruin his career for good.
Because of this pulled or cramped
muscle, no one should believe that
Jeff has been overworked, and that
that is the reason for the injury. It
is hard work which makes any run
ner, according to Ellington's theory
of coaching. Dean Cromwell thinks
in opposite terms, but your guess is
as good as mine that Jeff wouldn't
have been half the sprinter he is
today if he had followed Cromwell's
theory.
'ihat's why Jeff went to the Farm
—t:i work out under Templeton
and Ellington, who believed that
you can't go stale from hard
work. Jeff thrived on bis daily
woikouts which called for quar
ter-miles some nights and lots of
352's other nights besides running
t ie "hundred" and "furlong."
It wasn't a selfish attitude on the
part ot his coaches that he ran three
races in a dual meet and was en
tered in four events last Saturday
night (one open dash and three re
lays). Jeff liked to work hard, and
at Fresno he knew that he could
handle the iron-man assignment.
Jeff was hurt after the open 100-
yard dash, but he didn't say a thing
to Bill until after two relays had
been run and when he had definitely
hurt his leg muscle.
Jeff has made the ideal track
captain this year, and it is tough
that be may not be able to lead
them to what would be Stanford's
greatest track triumph next week.
There's still a chance, however,
that a strong man like Jeff can
beat the injury nnx.
