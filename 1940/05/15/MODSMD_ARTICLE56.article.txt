# Indians to End Hoop Practice
## 
### 
Having spent several weeks
mere or less experimenting with a
number of innovations, Stanford's
IJJ4I basketball squad winds up its
spring practice season at the end
of this week.
Previous to the last three weeks
Coach Everett Dean has had his
boys practicing a couple of times a
week with a larger hoop, which is
set 12 feet from the floor, and a
curve - top backboard. Neither the
new hoop size noi the new height
of the basket are regulation. How
ever, the new basketball rules do
provide for the optional use of the
curve-top backboard.
For the past three weeks the cage
squad has been having regular
practice sessions three and tour
time? a week. These practices have
featured work on fundamentals, of
fensive play, and individual weak
nesses, such as shooting and de
fensive tactics.
"After this week vvc will dis
band," said Coach Dean, "in or
der that the boys may go out for
ether sports or get ready for
finals."
Don Williams, Kenny Davidson,
Fordy Anderson, Bill Cowden, Dick
Taylor, and Bob Penn, regulars on
last, season's second-place quintet,
have all turned out for practice.
