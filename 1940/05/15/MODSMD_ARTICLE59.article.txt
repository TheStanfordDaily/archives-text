# Eight Men Will Enter Finn Meet
## 
### 
Exccpt for eight middle-distance
men, Stanford's clndermcn defi
nitely took it easy yesterday and
will continue to do so until next
Monday. Four quarter-miicrs and
four half - milers were the only
o.ies pressing at all yesterday, and
they were priming for the Finnish
Relief Meet this coming Friday
night in Los Angeles.
Coach Bill Ellington has decided
o send South mile- and two-mile
relay teams. The four-lap team will
be made up of 440 men Charlie
Shaw, Einie Clark, Craig William
son, and little Les Johnson. The first
three are members of the world
record holding quartet, and John
son is filling in for the injured Clyde
Jeffrey. Even without their anchor
man, the Cards ought to take this
event, for little Los is capable of
breaking 49 flat.
SKRABLE TO RUN
Four half-milers make up the
longer distance team. Ellington has
decided on running the hard-work
ing Burman Skrable as long as Ernie
Clark will see service in the mile
team, with Paul and Jack Moore,
and Blair Hyde. This quartet will
make a strong bid for the national
intercollegiate record, which is now
held by a Stanford team of J. Moore,
P. Moore, Skrable, and Girard.
Jack Moore and Blair Hyde were
sent scurrying through a 660 apiece
by their coach in order to improve
their wind. Jack came up with a
1:21.9 and Blair with a slightly faster
1:20.8.
QUIET WEEK-END
The rest of the squad will see no
service this week-end and will con
tinue their mild lay-off until the
first of next week. Then they go
to work in earnest in preparation
for the all-important Pacific Coast
Conference meet to be held the fol
lowing Friday and Saturday in Los
Angeles.
Yesterday Captain Clyde Jeffrey
was up on his feet and about at
track practice. Though his leg felt
weak from all the heat treatments it
has been having, he claimed that it
was no longer sore and that he felt
sure he would be able to work out
at the beginning of next week.
