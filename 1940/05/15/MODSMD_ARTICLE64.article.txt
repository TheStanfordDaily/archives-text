# Gridders Take Long Workout
## 
### 
Coach Clark Shaughnessy sent
his squad through a long work
out on fundamentals and dummy
scrimmage yesterday. The expect
ed scrimmage lasted only 10 min
utes.
"Chief" Norm Standlee ripped off
several sizeable chunks of yardage
in the short scrimmage and Quar
terback Frankie Albert completed a
sharp pass to Hugh Gallarneau for
the only counter.
The Cards wound up with punting
practice which saw Albert, Standlee,
Cookie South, and husky frosh end
Hank Norberg consistently send long
long long spirals down field.
Dick Palmer, promising guard up
from the frosh, is still bothered by
a pulled leg tendon, and quit prac
tice early. He is expected to be
back in shape in a week.
