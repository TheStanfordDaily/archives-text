Representing the furniture com
pany which is contesting the law are
William Snell and Harold Fulkei'son,
law seniors who were among those

vision one of the District Court of i

SEEK DAMAGES

ages incurred because the Swift Co.

! ture company in violation of provi

child labor, contained in the Fair

contract for the goods was made.
