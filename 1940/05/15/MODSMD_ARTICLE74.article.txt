# Shot in the Arm

### 
COMMITTKK began an investigation into the
(,onvalcsccnl Nome Drive last night that should
result in a marked strengthening of the I' arm s
favorite project and its more important financial
returns.
The Committee members, being representatives
of what does and does not please the campus, have
found that the Drive has dropped lower and lower
in popularit) and in revenue since the thrill, the
aristocratic exploitation, and the dirty dealings of
the old Kingâ€”Queen Masque l>all era. Lxcom dis
covered last night that the Home Drive needs an
antidote, a bottle <>! regenerative fluid that will put
the new Drive somewhere on a plane between the
dull and anli-cliniaxed proposition that it was this
vear and the hectic, undemocratic nightmare that it
was in the "good old davs.'
Neither the Committee members nor alumni
sponsors of the project are willing to concede the
contention that Stanford spirit and tradition have
dv\ indled in the past few years. Most of them agree
that every senior since the year '91 has erroneously
visualized the end of all pep and vigor on the Quad
with his graduation demise. The trouble, then, with
the Home Drive seems to be something that can
and probablv will be corrected.
The suggested changes are numerous. Most prom
inent and valuable ideas have been those which
foster a joint Back-to-the-Farm and Convalescent
\\ eek. Ijcsl time suggested for tin* amalgamated
funics! and search for funds seems to be the end
of the first and ali (if the second week of spring
quarter. Kxaininations and term papers would be
denizens of the distant future, moneybags and check
ing accounts would be bulging with spring quarter
allowances or salaries from vacation work. The
weather might even be good and there is better
Iliau an even chance of water slapping on the
Hoalhouse at Lagunita.
Heller than all these little reasons will be the fact
that the already highly successful Back-to-the-Farm
Barn Dance will be the top Friday night attraction
to a second week that was this vear as dead and as
uninviting as a seven-week-old herring.
\\ illi a renewed spirit and a super-duper dance
to guide the way. all the Drive heads will have to
do will be to prepare far in advance an intensive
and managed oil-campus drive.
I his vear s chairmen were selected late, ihe lead
ers had no adequate opportunity to study the suc
cesses and failures of past Drives. I.x Committee is
to be commended for being so far-sighted in its
planning for the "I I Drive.
