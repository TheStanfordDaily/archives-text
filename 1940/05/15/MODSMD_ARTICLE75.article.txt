days alter I he entrance of (ierman troops
into I lie Netherlands. ihe small maritime country
capitulated to I In* Nazi blitzkrieg to avoid needless
"destruction of women and children."
One of the main contributing factors lo the speed
and effectiveness of die (ierinan occupation is I he
ground work which has been done months, even
years in advance. Nazi agents hold ke\ positions
which, in the ease of Norway, enabled I hem lo con
trol ihe main airdromes almost from the very be
ginning.
I his \anguard. fiflh-colunm. or Trojan-horse
l\pe of tactics, whichever the newspaper that you
read happens to call it. constitutes one of the great
est fears that the \ 1 lied countries have. Kngland
has taken drastic steps to eliminate siicli possibili
ties. as have Rumania and many of the other
Italkan states.
Ihe danger of such tactics in this eountn sounds
fantasic. like something b\ Jules Verne, and a cer
tain percentage of it is pure fantas\ ; but how many
\inerican citizens stop to realize that once an alien,
whether he is a sp\ or not. has eluded the immigra
tion officials at porls-of-eutry he is free to under
mine our American institutions or lake jobs from
\merican citizens, as the case may be?
Mien registration is the answer which this coun
try will ultimately be forced lo accept. Not thai it
is particularly desirable from anv point of view
other than that of being practical, but this is the
go\erning factor loda\ and overpowers anv and all
arguments.
It may be argued that once a country Marts on
such a road of registration <>f aliens it has begun tin*
trip to totalitarianism. This jv certainly a mistake,
as most of the countries of the world employ some
such system. It would also tend In cut the crime rate
among aliens li \ ing> in the poor sections of our large
cities.
Laying aside domestic considerations, the danger

of underco\er activities fi<jm foreign powers is trc
mendous, and the United States in its present con
dition offers fertile ground for the mole-like tend
encies of the "fifth column."â€”G. H.
