# CAMPUS OPINION
## IN PURSUIT OF LIBERTY 
### 
r PHE EDITOR, SIR:
Pursuing your announced policy of looking at the
war in a cool and deliberate manner with a mind free
from prejudice, you have made certain illuminating
and profound (?) charges against those who believe
sincerely in the necessity for America's immediate and
complete participation in the present war. Your con
tentions are illuminating because they reveal you as
the ones who are hysterical rather than those you ac
cuse. It is you who are either unwilling or incapable
of attributing sincerity of purpose or an appreciation
of history to those with whom you are in opposition.
I favor America's entrance into the war. I have
reachcd this conclusion after serious thought and study.
Acocrding to you, I, and those who are in agreement
with me, are "hysterical," "unintelligent," "punch
drunk," and to top it off, "weak-minded suckers." Oth
ers who may applaud our assertions are, in your own
words, unable to listen "coolly and disinterestedly."
My convictions are based on my belief that despite
what you claim, events abroad involve something more
than "false" issues, and that the eclipse of freedom and
liberty constitutes more than a neighbor's family
quarrel.
You hold no monopoly on devotion to peace and
freedom. That my views fail to coincide with yours is
no indication that they are the product of hysteria.

P.S.: I also sent a message to President Roosevelt in
connection with his Friday address. You can guess
whether or not I criticized him.
