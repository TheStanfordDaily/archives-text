### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
TOMATO JUICE TO PTOMAINE
I LIKE Union food.
I cat Union food whenever I have the chance. I
am a simple fellow. I like Union food. Myfi'iends ask
me how I can stand to eat Union food all the time.
And I answer, "I'm rugged; I'm young; I'm healthy; I
can stand to eat Union food.
"Furthermore," I come back at my friends, "we of
this generation don't have much choice. It's either
bullets or Union gravy."
Another thing. Did you ever eat any of that de
licious Union veal steak? It's tender. It's seasoned
correctly. It's tasty. (I am used to eating fricasseed
saddle leather, peppered and garlicked.)
And Union coffee really delights my taste buds. I
drink it and drink it and drink it. And I can't taste
another thing. I love that coffee.
But my favorite dish is an 85-cent dinner. It takes
so long for the dinner to get served that I can get into
a bridge game before it arrives. If I get into a bridge
game, I can smoke many cigarettes by borrowing them
from my nervous partner. (My nervous partner smokes
incessantly.) And if I smoke lots of cigarettes, it kills
my appetite. I love Union food.

jyjY MOTHER and my doctor say that I ought to get
lots of fresh fruit. So whenever I go to the
Union I order fruit cocktail or fruit salad. And how
delicious they are! They are jftst chock full of goodies
—canned pineapple, canned pineapple, canned pine
apple, a lettuce leaf, and a maraschino cherry. I do
not stutter. I love Union food.
But sometimes the Union does not have any fruit
cocktail left. The hashers are forced to eat it up. So I
order sherbet in boysenberry juice. Some people say
the sight of sherbet and boysenberry juice is nauseat
ing. But I have tasted sherbet and boysenberry juice.
And relatively speaking, the people who think sherbet
and boysenberry juice looks nauseating are wrong.
Relatively it looks very good. That is why I order it.
I love Union food.
And for dessert I always order a fig bar with
whipped cream. It really tops off a meal. It sort of
makes my mind a little hazy, and everything is oh so
good. I love Union desserts—fig bars, marshmallow de
lights, and fruit jello. and fruit jello.
The only thing that worries me about Union food is
that I am a poor boy. And no matter how tasty the
food is, the bill always gives me a headache.

a bridge game before it arrives. If I get into a bridge
game, I can smoke many cigarettes by borrowing them
from my nervous partner. (My nervous partner smokes
incessantly.) And if I smoke lots of cigarettes, it kills
my appetite. I love Union food.

jyjY MOTHER and my doctor say that I ought to get
lots of fresh fruit. So whenever I go to the
Union I order fruit cocktail or fruit salad. And how
delicious they are! They are jftst chock full of goodies
—canned pineapple, canned pineapple, canned pine
apple, a lettuce leaf, and a maraschino cherry. I do
not stutter. I love Union food.
But sometimes the Union does not have any fruit
cocktail left. The hashers are forced to eat it up. So I
order sherbet in boysenberry juice. Some people say
the sight of sherbet and boysenberry juice is nauseat
ing. But I have tasted sherbet and boysenberry juice.
And relatively speaking, the people who think sherbet
and boysenberry juice looks nauseating are wrong.
Relatively it looks very good. That is why I order it.
I love Union food.
And for dessert I always order a fig bar with
whipped cream. It really tops off a meal. It sort of
makes my mind a little hazy, and everything is oh so
good. I love Union desserts—fig bars, marshmallow de
lights, and fruit jello. and fruit jello.
The only thing that worries me about Union food is
that I am a poor boy. And no matter how tasty the
food is, the bill always gives me a headache.
TOMATO JUICE TO PTOMAINE
I LIKE Union food.
I cat Union food whenever I have the chance. I
am a simple fellow. I like Union food. Myfi'iends ask
me how I can stand to eat Union food all the time.
And I answer, "I'm rugged; I'm young; I'm healthy; I
can stand to eat Union food.
"Furthermore," I come back at my friends, "we of
this generation don't have much choice. It's either
bullets or Union gravy."
Another thing. Did you ever eat any of that de
licious Union veal steak? It's tender. It's seasoned
correctly. It's tasty. (I am used to eating fricasseed
saddle leather, peppered and garlicked.)
And Union coffee really delights my taste buds. I
drink it and drink it and drink it. And I can't taste
another thing. I love that coffee.
But my favorite dish is an 85-cent dinner. It takes
so long for the dinner to get served that I can get into
a bridge game before it arrives. If I get into a bridge
game, I can smoke many cigarettes by borrowing them
from my nervous partner. (My nervous partner smokes
incessantly.) And if I smoke lots of cigarettes, it kills
my appetite. I love Union food.
