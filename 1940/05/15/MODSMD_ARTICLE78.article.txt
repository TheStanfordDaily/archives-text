## THE 						PEACE MOVEMENT AND THE WAR 
### JOHN W. MASLAND Instructor in Political Science 
in the minds of all of us is the question
of the path our country should follow during the
war in Europe. One group from whom we might ex
pect help is the organized peace movement. Its lead
ers command a wide following, and at times have had
considerable influence in Washington. How do they
face the war?
Anyone expecting to receive constructive guid
ance from the professional peace workers will be
sadly disillusioned. For years they have quarreled
among themselves. Preaching world co-operation
they have been unable to settle even their own petty
differences over conflicting jurisdictions. A few years
ago there were prospects of accord with the estab
lishment of the National Peace Conference, a co-oper
ating body of 40-odd member-organizations, but be
fore much progress could be made the conference di
vided irreparably over the neutrality issue. Since then
"isolationists" and "internationalists," have been name
calling with increasing bitterness. The result is hope
less division.

r "internationalists," organized around the finan
cial support of the Carnegie Endowment for Inter
national Peace, and with close ties wtih prominent per
sons on the Eastern seaboard notorious for their pro-
British sentiments, push toward greater support of
the Allies. The peace plans which they advocate re
quire an Allied victory. One searches their publica
tions in vain for even the slightest questioning of
Allied war aims. They have placed themselves in a
position where they will inevitably demand American
intervention if the Allies are threatened by defeat.
"Peace" leaders will be advocating war, as they did
in 1917. The "isolationists," on the other hand, have
retreated to a deplorable extreme in the other direc
tion. Extremely critical of the late British policy of
appeasement, they nevertheless advocate the same sort
of thing for the United States. Their attitude is ex
tremely negative.
For one who believes that there is a middle course
by which the United States may remain at peace and
serve the best interests of the world, the conclusion is
disheartening. Divided as it is, the peace movement
cannot ofTer a united leadership. If ihe time comes
: when America must decide between war and peace, it
j is likely that the "internationalists" will not want to
' keep us out of war and that the "isolationists" will be
I unable to do so. The peace movement offers no solu-
I tion to our problem.

in the minds of all of us is the question
of the path our country should follow during the
war in Europe. One group from whom we might ex
pect help is the organized peace movement. Its lead
ers command a wide following, and at times have had
considerable influence in Washington. How do they
face the war?
Anyone expecting to receive constructive guid
ance from the professional peace workers will be
sadly disillusioned. For years they have quarreled
among themselves. Preaching world co-operation
they have been unable to settle even their own petty
differences over conflicting jurisdictions. A few years
ago there were prospects of accord with the estab
lishment of the National Peace Conference, a co-oper
ating body of 40-odd member-organizations, but be
fore much progress could be made the conference di
vided irreparably over the neutrality issue. Since then
"isolationists" and "internationalists," have been name
calling with increasing bitterness. The result is hope
less division.

r "internationalists," organized around the finan
cial support of the Carnegie Endowment for Inter
national Peace, and with close ties wtih prominent per
sons on the Eastern seaboard notorious for their pro-
British sentiments, push toward greater support of
the Allies. The peace plans which they advocate re
quire an Allied victory. One searches their publica
tions in vain for even the slightest questioning of
Allied war aims. They have placed themselves in a
position where they will inevitably demand American
intervention if the Allies are threatened by defeat.
"Peace" leaders will be advocating war, as they did
in 1917. The "isolationists," on the other hand, have
retreated to a deplorable extreme in the other direc
tion. Extremely critical of the late British policy of
appeasement, they nevertheless advocate the same sort
of thing for the United States. Their attitude is ex
tremely negative.
For one who believes that there is a middle course
by which the United States may remain at peace and
serve the best interests of the world, the conclusion is
disheartening. Divided as it is, the peace movement
cannot ofTer a united leadership. If ihe time comes
: when America must decide between war and peace, it
