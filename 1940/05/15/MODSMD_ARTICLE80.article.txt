# Gilbert & Sullivan Satirize Victorian Life in 'Pinafore'
## 
### 
"11.M.5. Pinafore" and "Savoy Sere- |
nade," now playing at the Curran ;
Theater in San Francisco.
Gilbert and Sullivan built them- 1
selves an utterly charming, mad
world, but being Gilbert and Sulli
van, they carefully equipped this
world with glass walls. Then the
two of them settled themselves smack
in the middle of their land and glee
fully began to throw stones at the
stuffed-shirts who passed by their
windows. It's the same sort of spirit
that makes a street urchin throw
bricks at the lovely plate glass in
department stores, and stick pins in
balloons.
Everyone has his own favorite
Gilbert and Sulivan piece unless he
Ls one of the unfortunate souls who
are unacquainted with the work of
these two late Victorian satirists. If
you're in this category, then you
should take a trip up to the Curran
and brush up on this sample of light,
opera at its best.
G. & S. POTPOURRI
Not only do you see "Pinafore,"
but also, in a specially arranged
"Savoy Serenade" they sing many of
the popular songs from the other
G. & S. operettas. Both are excel
lently staged and directed.
John Charles Thomas apparently
gets a whale of a bang out of play
ing in non-opera. It's almost a shock
to hear his effortless magnificent
voice letting loose on things like
"Fair Moon Above" and "The Merry
Maiden and the Tar." But, come to
think of it, his physical appearance
is right for the part of Captain Cor
coran, and his pompous style of line
delivery is certainly in character.
EXCELLENT CAST
Hope Manning, strong contender
for the title of World's Most Beauti
ful Soprano, Melville Cooper, Eric
Mattson, and Alice Gentle and Delos
Jewkes hold up the supporting roles
in admirable fashion.
The fun really began when Miss
Manning, Cooper, and Thomas
joined in "Bell Trio." They took
encore after encore for this non
sensical vignette, and I'll bet that
after the first two, they were ad
libbing in the horse-play.
RIBS BRITISH PRIDE
Best of the songs in "Pinafore" is
the one with the lines: "For he is
an Englishman—he himself has said
it—and it's GREATLY to his cred
it . . the boys had quite an in
sight into national character.
But you may have a little emo

tional hurdling to do before you can
settle down to enjoy the fun. You
will if you're not used to getting the
"Star Spangled Banner" along with
the overture. According to what the
older folks tell me. they haven't done
that since 1918.—Nowell
Statues in French cities commemo
rate the nation's great gourmets.
