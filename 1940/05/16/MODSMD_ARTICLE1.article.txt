### WILSON CANNON 
IN 1914 Kaiser Wilhelm II staked
his German empire on a plan he
thought would make him master of
Europe.
Two weeks ago the Kaiser's more
daring successor set the same plan in
motion. Adolf Hitler is playing for
the same stakes, using the same
stacked deck — but his chances of
raking in the chips are better than
Wilhelm's ever were.
The system is the famous "Schlief
fen plan." You heard about it in
your Poli Sci course. During the
next few months you will see this
revamped twin in action.
Should it work, Germany will
probably attempt a conquest of
the British Isles by air and sea.
If Hitler lands in England, it will
he the first invasion of the Isles
in 900 years.
But the toss of a coin could de
cide the success or failure of the
plan. If it fails, the backbone of
the Nazi army will he broken.
1914's stalemate will be repeated,
with the Reich again playing a de
fensive role.
The 1914 original of the plan
foresaw a knockout blow at Holland
and Belgium. The Imperial Army
was to sweep through northern
France, over Paris, and crush the
French army against its own eastern
fortifications.
It failed in 1914. Russia gave the
Kaiser an unexpected battle on the
eastern battlefront. Belgium with
stood the flower of the empire's
forces for 16 days—long enough to
enable the Allies to prepare a sadly
needed defense. The right wing of
the German forces proved too weak.
# * #
r Russia and the Reich are
closer than two sardines in a
can. Hitler boasts that his eastern
flank is secure. This, as much as any
other single factor, may bring victory
to the swastika.
The second major factor is still in
doubt. Belgium has been able to
hold her own under tremendous
odds. She will probably be licked
soon, but every day she holds off
disaster means added reprieve for the
English.
Early this week the German
high command served virtual ul
timatum on Brussels, key point of
the Belgian defense. Once the
Brussels-Antwerp resistance is
wiped out, the "SchlicfTen plan"
can be brought to completion.
According to the Germans.
Last night Nazi forces pounded on
Iwo general fronts. First was the
Brussels-Antwerp corner. Second
was the Sedan sector on the French
Maginot Line.
All indications pointed to the fact
that the Sedan battle was merely a
'sideshow" for a "risk everything"
push along the front i>i mid-Bel
gium.
* * *
JNTERNATIONAL opinion held
that, the most decisive battle of
the war will be fought during the
next few days in Belgium.
Even the British high command
admitted that this key spot seemed
"the real issue in the entire German
campaign."
United Press Belgian correspond
ent added the exclamation point to
the British admission. He claimed
that "the battle of Brussels" was al
ready under way with terrific air
bombardments blasting the weary
defenders.
From Brussels itself came a vi
tuperant claim that German bomb
ers held "civilians and non-com
batants as fair game."
German "SchlicfTen plan" ex
ponents claim that a Flanders vic
tory is all that is necessary for a
comparative early end of the war.
Even these will admit, however,
that should the impending battle in
Belgium go badly their "plan" may
prove abortive.
English defense officials, on their
part, are wondering if air attack on
the Isles will be postponed until
German victory in the Low Coun
tries.
Churchill & Co. fear attack may
come at any hour. They have seen
too many Nazi "blitzkrieg" sur
prises.

ent added the exclamation point to
the British admission. He claimed
that "the battle of Brussels" was al
ready under way with terrific air
bombardments blasting the weary
defenders.
From Brussels itself came a vi
tuperant claim that German bomb
ers held "civilians and non-com
batants as fair game."
German "SchlicfTen plan" ex
ponents claim that a Flanders vic
tory is all that is necessary for a
comparative early end of the war.
Even these will admit, however,
that should the impending battle in
Belgium go badly their "plan" may
prove abortive.
English defense officials, on their
part, are wondering if air attack on
the Isles will be postponed until
German victory in the Low Coun
tries.
Churchill & Co. fear attack may
come at any hour. They have seen
too many Nazi "blitzkrieg" sur
prises.
