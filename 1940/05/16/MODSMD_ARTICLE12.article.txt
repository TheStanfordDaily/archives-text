# Cardinals Plan Change in Drive
## Home Solicitations May Be Held in Fall 
### 
Plans for putting more enthu
siasm into the Convalescent Home
Drive were discussed last night at
Cardinals meeting when commit
tee chairmen for the drive sug
gested improvements on this year's
organization of the drive.
A committee from Ex Committee
of Bill Rapp, Barney Ferguson, and
Mollie West will meet Monday night
with Sue Hynxan, Ken Koch, and
Jack Alltucker of Cardinals to re
organize the drive for next year.
Consensus was that the on-campus
drive should take place fall quar
ter when people have more money,
while the rest of the drive should be
during the first two weeks of spring
quarter. This year the on-campus
drive and tag day were below last
year, while the off-campus drive
showed the greatest improvement.
The Magic Lamp was not as success
ful as last year.
It was agreed that the drive should
be combined with Back to the Farm
Week, with Labor Day being the day
for farm and old-fashioned cos
tumes. It was also suggested that a
barn dance follow the barbecue or
else be the climax to the drive, re
placing the Masque Ball.
Revival of the King-Queen contest
was admitted as a possibility be
cause it always made several thou
sand dollars. It was discontinued
because the University objected to
the publicity.
The committee will report its
findings Tuesday night at the Ex
com meeting.
