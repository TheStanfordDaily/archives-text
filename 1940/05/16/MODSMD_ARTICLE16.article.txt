# Farm Firemen Escape Rent, Rushing, Dues
## 
### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
No room rent. No rushing. No
dues.
That's the Firehouse — the only
organized living group on cam
pus where the students not only
get their keep and receive pay,
hut have the social advantages of
Hall and Kow residents.
The lives of 13 Stanford men re
volve about the Firehouse, the only
.student, fire-fighting organization in
the United States. Half the fellows
are on duty for one week and must
remain in or near the station from
5 o'clock in tho evening to 8 o'clock
the next, morning. During Sun
days and holidays, including Christ
mas and Easter, a shift is on duty
day and night.
ACTIVITY NKW
During school hours the Corpora
tion Yard employees are on call to
attend any emergency until the stu
dent crew arrives.
And those sirens one hears
screeching about the campus every
Sunday—it's just the crew in u week
ly practice session.
But it's not all work. The student
firemen have barbecues and outings,
and have made an enviable record
in campus activities. They are now
contemplating, half-humorously, a
trophy case to house the awards won
this year — for intramural football
and track championship ;uul for their
Big Game float.
SELF-SUPPORTING
They all sleep in one big room
above the station, and near the beds
are their turn - out emergency
clothes. Ample study rooms are pro
vided and quiet, hours are enforced
—some of the time.
Tho fellows are earning 100 per
cent of their expenses.
Boss of the Firehouse is gruff, but
kindly Chief R. E. Dugan, who has
served in this capacity for 19 years.
Second in command is Prince, the
fox-terrier masci/, who accornpa
nies the chief everywhere. And
when Price ran off one night, almost
all the crew was seen scouring the
country for him.
Two full-time captains are also
t mpioyed.
OPEN lIOUSK FRIDAY
»The fire department is relatively
well equipped, having two water
wagons, a laddc war on, and pump
I tuck. A 50-foot. drill tower is used
