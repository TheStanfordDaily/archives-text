# Spring Show Tops Farm Weekend Bill
## 'Strangler' Starts Run Tomorrow, 8:15; Features Love, Jive 
### 
Love, murder, music and comedy
will be combined tomorrow and Sat
urday nights when Ram's Head pre
sents its annual Spring Show, "I'm a
Strangler Here Myself." at 8:15
o'clock in Memorial Hall. According
to Director Charlie Bulotti, this is
in keeping with the policy of giving
the public what it wants, no matter
what.
Authors Harry Muheim, A1 Zel
ver, and Charlie Bulotti have con
structed this musical comedy around
an accounting professor, of the more
vicious sort, who is murdered while
he is making out the final for his
course.
SCRAMBLE FOR REWARD
The trustees and faculty of an en
dowed university, a police depart
ment desperately in need of pants
for the men of the force, and a group
ot students with the usual occupa
tional monetary problems all be
come involved in the scramble for
the professor's fortune, amassed
from his textbook royalties.
The cast includes Harry Muheim
as Detective Hennessey, a "lousy"
detective, but the owner of the only
pair of pants in the department;
Tony Cefaratti as a long suffering
chief of police; Nancy Behlke as the
professor's widow, just a bit vague,
but awfully willing to co-operate.
CAST CONTINUED
John La wry as Professor Steele,
among the quick for one scene and
very dead for the rest of the show;
Ash Wilson as O. B. Noxious, a fra
ternity man with a gift for dirty
cracks; Dana Winters as a harassed
house manager; and Aubrey Austin
as an athlete complete with hashing
job and NYA contract.
Others in the cast are:
Pat Bernard, Brad Young, Hays
Bush, Betty Brown, Bob O'Neill,
Nancy Veitch, Bill Graham, Bert
Williamson, Quentin Warren, Jane
Thornton, Mid Olson, Merle Meach
nm, Tommy Dee, and the Moskies.
Bulotti has promised a show, "just
as fast, if not faster, than the Gaie
ties" with no waits between scenes.
This will be worked out through use
of the balconies, scenes and patter
songs in front of the curtain.
Tickets for the performance arc
priced at $1, 75 cents, and 50 cents.
