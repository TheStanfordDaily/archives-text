# French Battle to Hold Maginot Line Against Swift German Legions
## Nazis Break through Meuse River Defense, Plan Gigantic Aerial Raid On Brussels; Sedan Is Focal Point 
### 
PARIS, May 15 (UP). â€”Hastily reinforced French troops are battling
desperately to clear the outer fortifications of the Maginot Line of German
forces who have broken the Allies' Meuse River line of defense at "several
points," a War OlTice communique revealed tonight.
Military spokesmen, describing a gigantic battle involving 1,000,000 men
and swarms of tanks and warplanes, said French counter-attacks had

the Germans back six miles
| through the Maginot forts in the
Sedan sector, but the official commu
nique refrained from such a claim.
The Belgian cities of Brussels and
Antwerp are under heavy siege, it
was said officially, with the Germans
"attacking violently" behind tanks
against British - French - Belgian
lines from Antwerp southward to
ward Namur on the Meuse.

South of Namur toward Charle
ville-Mezieres, 15 miles east of Ger
man-held Sedan, the Germans suc
ceeded in storming across to the east
bank of the Meuse "at several
points," tonight's communique ad
mitted.
The communique told of 11 more
German planes shot down.
Nearly 100 miles to the north
along the Meuse Germany's swift
mechanized forces closed in upon
the Belgian capital of Brussels, lay
ing waste the World War's "martyr
city" of Louvain.
Disputing Nazi claims, the French
command insisted tonight the Ger
mans had been unable to break
through the main defenses of the
Maginot. Line at any point and
French troops were "counter - at
tacking everywhere."
FIGHT AT SEDAN
In the Sedan pocket where the
Germans are trying to blast a hole
in the Maginot sunken forts and
ramparts the Germans were driven
back six miles in fierce fighting in
which both sides used enormous
numbers of bombing and fighting
planes, tanks and armored cars.
When the "Battle of the Meuse"
lifted the war out. of its eight months
of doldrums on the Western Front
with terrible fury the Germans drove
10 miles across the French border
and took historic Sedan. Then they
crossed the Meuse on pontoon
bridges, despite heavy Allied aerial
and artillery bombardment, and
drove 10 more miles into the outer
fortifications of the Maginot Line.
GERMANS STAND
Tonight, however, they were hold
ing tenaciously to the four-mile-long
strip that remains of their 10-mile
drive southward from the Meu.se
banks.
The German high command in
Berlin claimed jubilantly the Ma
ginot Line had been "pierced" on
the southern bank of the Meuse at
captured Sedan, but military spokes
men in Paris denied this claim.
French authorities made no at
i tempt, however, to minimize the se
riousness of the situation and said
the crisis of the moment was at
Sedan, historic city where the Ger
mans administered a crushing defeat
I to the French armies of Napoleon 111
I and won the war of 1870.
