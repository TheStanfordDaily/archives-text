### 
WASHINGTON, May 15 (UP). —The Senate Naval Affairs Committee
today called for a "warlike" defense of the Western Hemisphere and a
Navy .sufficiently strong to meet and defeat an enemy fleet before it
reaches American shores.
Reversing past policy, the committee urged that the mid-Pacific
island of Guam be made "a link in a

our scheme of national defense by
developing its harbor and facilities."
The committee and Congress on

three occasions have rejected Navy
Department requests for authority to
develop Guam. The committee also
said that "it might be desirable to
reconsider the question of building
a canal across Nicaragua."
