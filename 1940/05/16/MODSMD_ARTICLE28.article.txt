# URGES VINSON BILL
## 
### 
The statements were contained in
a report filed with the Senate on
behalf of the committee by Chair
man Sen. David I. Walsh, D., Mass.,
urging passage of the House-ap
proved Vinson Bill to authorize an
11 per cent expansion of the Navy.
The committee approved the meas
ure last week.
The report urged adoption of a

strong military policy to supplement
sea forces, but said that military air
craft have failed to demonstrate that,
without the assistance of ships, they
can ward oft' enemy control of the
sea.
It called for improvement of ex
isting bases and building of new
bases where needed, including
Guam.
"The Panama Canal and its ap
proaches," it said, "must be fortified
and protected to such an extent that
they cannot be damaged and will be
available for the transfer of our fleet
from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and
vice versa, as necessary. The ex
isting submarine and naval air bases
there should be extended and im
proved. It might be desirable to re
consider the question of building a
canal across Nicaragua.
NO MENACE
"The armies of Europe and Asia
do not menace us," it said. "To be
a menace, they must be transported
across the sea and operate from
bases in or near this hemisphere.
"The important question now be
ing decided in Europe," the commit
tee report said, "is whether naval
forces can retain command of the
sea communications of an island in
close proximity to a continent on
which is located a superior force or
shore-based aircraft.
"Due to the limited range of air
craft, our self-sufficiency in food,
and our geographical location, the
United States is not confronted with
a similar situation. Our home ports
and shipping centers are not only
farther from tenable air bases but
they cover a wider area and are
available in two oceans."
