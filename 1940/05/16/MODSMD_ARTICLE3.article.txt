# Halm, Goodman Win Court Trial
## 
### 
By a 2-1 margin, the "Swift Dis
tributing Company," represented by
Horace Hahn and Owen Goodman,
was awarded the decision in Stan
ford's Moot Court last night in the
Education Auditorium. The pair,
defending the Fair Labor Standards
Act, will receive the Law Society's
annual cash award.
Appellants William Snell and Har
old Fulkerson argued that the Act
was void, but that in addition the
"Garden Furnishing Company" did
not come within the jurisdiction of
the Act because it was not directly
participating in interstate commerce.
Respondents held that the furniture
company knew that the goods it was
producing were intended for inter
state commerce.
Judges of the "court" were the
Honorable William Healy, of the
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for
the ninth district, who handed down
the "court's" decision; the Honorable
Jesse Carter, associate justice of the
California Supreme Court; and Ray
mond Peters, presiding judge of di
vision one of the District Court of
Appeals.
