# Rogers Stars In Laundered Lincoln Novel
## 
### 
J "Primrose Path," now playing at the
Stanford Theater.
"Primrose Path" is Hollywood's
j version of Victoria Lincoln's "Feb
ruary Hill." It is the tale of a girl
I from the wrong side of the tracks
! who struggles to overcome her en
! vironment and remain pure. With
! this as a basis, plus a little of Tar
! kington's "Alice Adams" and some
excellent acting, the film emerges as
| a creditable example of what can be
done in the way of a pretty creaky
| melodrama.
Ginger Rogers plays the part of
I the adolescent heroine struggling
| to keep off the "primrose path" in
| spite of the temptations which beset
| every young girl, in this instance
i more numerous than usual. At the
] end of the film she almost falls into
the sink of sin, but the Hays office
steps in in time to save her self-
I respect and its own face.
! MARRIAGE NEARLY FLOPS
Joel McCrea plays the part of the
I young man whom she inveigles into
; marriage with a tragic sob story,
1 and then almost loses through her
J trusting honesty.
The movie suffers from melodrama
: in places; probably these could have
J been avoided with a more thought
ful editing job. There is just a trifle
| too much tragedy when the mother
| dies, the father staggers in drunk,
| and the girl ioses her husband all
j in the space of five screen minutes.
I EXCELLENT SUPPORT
These faults, however, are bal
l anced by excellent character acting
j on the part of Marjorie Rambeau and
I the supporting cast. For perhaps
| Lhe neatest bit characterization to
emerge from Hollywood's standard
i ized film-machine in many a moon,
| honors must go to the old grand
mother. The scene in which she
teaches her five-year-old grand
daughter to recite "Don't Swat Your
Mothers, Boys," with appropriate
gestures, is especially good.
This is a cleaned-up version of
Miss Lincoln's Rabelaisian novel,
and the producers have done a re
markably good job of retaining the
flavor and spirit of the book despite
the changed ending.â€”Reichert
