## FRANK GUTHRIE, Sports Editor END OF THE TRAIL FOR DIZ? 
### 

DIZ DEAN, Wrigley's $1X5.000 liability, may be at the end of the trail.
Six years ago. he and his brother Paul burned up the National League
pitching for the pennant-winning Cardinals. Diz was shelled from
the mound in less than two innings in his most recent start and has
yet to hit a winning stride this year.
