# Stanford Relay Men Prepare For Relief Meet Friday Night
## 
### 
The greater part of Coach Bill
Ellington's track team continued its
moratorium on strenuous workouts,
content to stand by and watch the
Cards' eight relay men prepare for
the Finnish Relief meet this Friday
evening.
Yesterday Paul Moore led his fel
low teammates in the two-mile relay
team through an 880. In order to
pace Blair Hyde and Jack Moore,
Paul allowed these two to run their
own pace for Ihe first lap and then
pressed them in the final lap to win
in around 1:53.
Ellington had his watch on the
second-place man, Hyde, who ran
1:54.9; Jack Moore was about 10
yards back in 1:56. Ellington also
sent his mile relay runners through
that favorite race of his, the 352-
yard dash, as well as through some
220's.
Fans and tracksters are, however,
looking over these two relay races
tomorrow night, one of which will

be a determined attack on the inter
collegiate two-mile relay record,
and are thinking of that Coast Con
ference meet next week. In con
sidering this meet, Ellington & Co.
received, not with very much re
gret, the news that U.S.C.'s great
javelin thrower, Bob Peoples, had
bi'oken his throwing arm and would
be out for the remainder of the
season.
Though the Trojans probably still
have the best javelin tosser on the
Coast in Hugo DeGroot, it means
that they will lost first-place points
and that Stanford's Bob Stone ought
to move up into second position.
