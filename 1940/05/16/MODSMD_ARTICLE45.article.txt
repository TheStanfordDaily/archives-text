# Grid Team Holds Secret Practice
## 
### 
Coach Clark Shaughnessy locked
the gates of the practice field yester
day and sent his varsity through a
hard two-hour drill. Feature of the
drill was the scrum session in which
the first string looked better than at
any time this year.
Doug Stahle is still holding down
the top spot in the struggle for the
center position on the "A" squad,
but he's getting plenty of competi
tion from Jim Verdieck, Colin Mc-
Clintock, and Vic Lindskog.
Verdieck was the regular pivot
man last fall, but, after turning out
late at the end of baseball season,
hasn't been able to displace the
peppery sophomore. McClintock was
top man in spring practice last year,
and saw a lot of action last fall, but
when the season ended he was on
the third string.
Lindskog, a transfer from Santa
Ana Junior College, is a rangy 200-
pounder who has been working at
center so far, but he may be shifted
to some other position on the line,
as the center post seems to be pretty
well taken care of.
