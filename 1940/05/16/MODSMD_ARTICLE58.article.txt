\ good mans American communities, finding
themselves in the same dilemma that Stanford is
now lacing, have combined all their charitable
forces into one great objective, the fostering of a
(.oininnnitv Chest. It seems logical to conclude that
such a |)lan would work here on the Farm. Student
contributors, knowing that thev would be dunned
once and onlv once in ;i single academic \car. would
undoubtedly gi\e freely and willingly when the
proper agency came around lo sign them up.
What the average Community Chest oily does is
lo sel a total which lliey hope to reach, through a
process d| budgeting. I hen llie amount collected
is pro-rated among the various member agencies in
several lashious. usually accotding lo the estimated
\aljic ol the institution or in ratio to the amounts
which the institution formerly collected before it
w;is aHilialed with the parent group. If the proposed
budget i> mil reached in the collections, the member
agencies naturally lake another pro-rated slash in

several strong groups, with ample publicity, ample
workers, and a pet charity to please even the most
hardened individualist.

would still be no need lo abolish the essentials of
the Home Week. Only the actual drives for cash

If ihc plan should lake hold in the hearts of Ex
