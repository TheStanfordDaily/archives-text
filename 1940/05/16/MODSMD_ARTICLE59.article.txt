# CAMPUS OPINION
## EUROPEAN WAR 
### 
'THE EDITOR, SIR:
In his recent article on war feeling, MellinkofT
has really m;ide the point. I simply want to empha
size one aspect of the situation. It is that in the last
few weeks I have noticed a propensity on the part
of the campus to act and talk as though we were
necessarily going to be involved in the European War.
It is.1 European War; let us consider it only that.
If we continue to consider ourselves as potential
yun-fodder, we will he easily transformed from a na
tion of peace to a nation at war. This metamorphosis

will nut easily be realized if we keep insistently in
our minds that we must not at any cost tight another
person's war on another person's ground.
♦ «■ # *
yt/'E, the young people, are the ones who will be
called on to fight the war; we are the ones who
are being bombarded with propaganda that blacks out
the intellect; we are the ones who are being enlisted
in the civilian flying corps; we are the ones who are
supposed to be educated and intelligent; we are the
ones, in short, who have everything to lose by going
to war and only death or disfigurement to gain.
Yes, we must be adequately equipped to defend our
own shores, but let us only think of our participation
in war in that regard. We must associate the idea of
war in our minds only with the idea of protecting our
land while we are standing on it. As someone must
have said, "millions ofr defense but not one life for
somebody else's war."
It is in our own minds first that we must keep out
of war.
Sincerely,
Newton Russell, '40
