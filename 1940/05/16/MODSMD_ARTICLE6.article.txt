# BELGIAN AIRCRAFT DEFENSES

### 

THIS RAPID-FIRING anti-aircraft gun is shown at one of the Bel
gian front line defenses. King Leopold has been reported leading the
fighting army, as did his father Albert, in the first World War, when
the Germans invaded Belgium in practically the same manner as is
now being done.
