### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
LINES, LINGO. AND LOVE
I TITLE did Havelock Ellis suspect that he was ask
ing for real technical skill when he advised all
men "to master the art of making love." I refer to the
linguistic forms, the cliches and quick retorts, that
must be mastered by the amorous college man.
Stanford romance is a case in point. The unini
tiated chap, with Tennysonian ideals about love, may
fancy that the matter is fairly clear-cut. You ask a
girl for a date. If you get the first date and you want
another date, you ask her for it. And so on. But the
verbal stumbling blocks that haunt an honest effort to
get a date are the grim obstacles that the naive do
not see. (All this, of course, is data gathered at sec
ond hand; I'm sorry to say I am not talking from per
sonal experience.)
If you want to make your request for a date effec
tive at all you have to size up the situation and decide
what kind of hokum to use. Suppose, for example, that
the girl is the sophisticated type, with intellectual
halitosis perhaps, but with a god share of frozen as
sets. Then you must talk in a self-confident, breezy
manner, as though to say, "I've done this so many times
before." And by all means choose a conventional place
to go; the lady will appreciate being seen by the right
people.
You say, after appropriate overtures, "Would you
like to go dancing Friday night? Good. The Fran
tic? Fine." And then you sort of yawn into the phone.
"See you at eight."
* $ * $
B" T now suppose the girl is a bumpy-brain, the
kind who strains to be unconventional. You start
out, "What's doin'?" And after some dizzy banter
about some mess or other you have been in you say,
"Whatta ya doin' Friday night? Let's do something,
eh? O.K. Well, let's not decide what we'll do now.
Spur of the moment stuff. I always hate to plan things
anyway." You have, of course, already reserved a
table at Vanessi's, tickets to "Show Boat," and ar
ranged to double with a gay couple who talk like
Olson and Johnson.
* * #
Then there is an entirely different line that must be
acquired for the romantic girl who is sort of soft and
demands attention and flattery. When you see her
you say, "You look more lovely than you did last time;
I didn't think it was possible." And you send her
flowers and remember her birthday, the date of which
she "slips" out in a carefully-planned conversation
maneuver. She's tricky. Watch for leads.
A sure way to butch yourself with any Stanford
woman, however, is to work through her room-mate.
You are likely to blurt out, "But darling! I don't know
which one to take out —Betty or you."
Above all, never be yourself. Use only a calcu
lated set of verbal forms, designed to meet the par
ticular situation and to conceal your real person
ality. Then you will never know what your wife is
really like, and vice-versa. But people will say as you
enter a salon, "My, don't they make a lovely couple!"

enter a salon, "My, don't they make a lovely couple!"
LINES, LINGO. AND LOVE
I TITLE did Havelock Ellis suspect that he was ask
ing for real technical skill when he advised all
men "to master the art of making love." I refer to the
linguistic forms, the cliches and quick retorts, that
must be mastered by the amorous college man.
Stanford romance is a case in point. The unini
tiated chap, with Tennysonian ideals about love, may
fancy that the matter is fairly clear-cut. You ask a
girl for a date. If you get the first date and you want
another date, you ask her for it. And so on. But the
verbal stumbling blocks that haunt an honest effort to
get a date are the grim obstacles that the naive do
not see. (All this, of course, is data gathered at sec
ond hand; I'm sorry to say I am not talking from per
sonal experience.)
If you want to make your request for a date effec
tive at all you have to size up the situation and decide
what kind of hokum to use. Suppose, for example, that
the girl is the sophisticated type, with intellectual
halitosis perhaps, but with a god share of frozen as
sets. Then you must talk in a self-confident, breezy
manner, as though to say, "I've done this so many times
before." And by all means choose a conventional place
to go; the lady will appreciate being seen by the right
people.
You say, after appropriate overtures, "Would you
like to go dancing Friday night? Good. The Fran
tic? Fine." And then you sort of yawn into the phone.
"See you at eight."
* $ * $
B" T now suppose the girl is a bumpy-brain, the
kind who strains to be unconventional. You start
out, "What's doin'?" And after some dizzy banter
about some mess or other you have been in you say,
"Whatta ya doin' Friday night? Let's do something,
eh? O.K. Well, let's not decide what we'll do now.
Spur of the moment stuff. I always hate to plan things
anyway." You have, of course, already reserved a
table at Vanessi's, tickets to "Show Boat," and ar
ranged to double with a gay couple who talk like
Olson and Johnson.
* * #
Then there is an entirely different line that must be
acquired for the romantic girl who is sort of soft and
demands attention and flattery. When you see her
you say, "You look more lovely than you did last time;
I didn't think it was possible." And you send her
flowers and remember her birthday, the date of which
she "slips" out in a carefully-planned conversation
maneuver. She's tricky. Watch for leads.
A sure way to butch yourself with any Stanford
woman, however, is to work through her room-mate.
You are likely to blurt out, "But darling! I don't know
which one to take out —Betty or you."
Above all, never be yourself. Use only a calcu
lated set of verbal forms, designed to meet the par
ticular situation and to conceal your real person
ality. Then you will never know what your wife is
really like, and vice-versa. But people will say as you
enter a salon, "My, don't they make a lovely couple!"
