## BROADER HORIZONS IN VOCATIONAL CHOICES 
### STANLEY SHARP 
Assistant Dean of Men
for young people are often determined
on Ihc most casual basis. When Billy was five he
did not flinch at the sight of blood and his parents
decided therefore that he was lo become a doctor. At
the early age of nine Johnny displayed a talent for
using tools which predestined him to become an engi
neer. But the fact has long since been recognized that
a talent for using tools does not necessarily indicate
an aptitude for engineering, which is far more likely
to be associated with an aptitude in mathematics and
reasoning power and imagination in physics.
It is not easy to make a rational choice of a voca
tion. The individual himself, his parents, and his
friends find it exceedingly difficult, if not impossible,
to make objective observations which might lead to
meaningful and helpful conclusions. The choice of an
occupation is fraught with such a complexity of fac
tors that bewilderment and confusion very often tri
umph, causing even the pursuit of information upon
which a rational choice might be made to be aban
doned.
In recent years there has developed a movement
to place less emphasis on specific vocations and to give
more consideration to functional groupings of voca
tions. The advantages of such a new approach are at
once apparent: the individual finds his problem sim
plified; counsellors can more easily and probably more
accurately study and measure wider fields of apti
tudes, interests, and other factors such as personality;
and possibilities are left for adjustment to changing
conditions and chance factors over which the individual
has no control.

of this trend more clearly. Each year thousands
of students in the United States discover that they can
not gain admission to medical school. If they take
the newer and broader outlook they will not suddenly
groyv bewildered and despondent and in despair turn
to any chance field—as do many who take the old view
point—but thev will simply turn to a more or less
related field, choosing from among the following voca
tions: dentistry (where, it is claimed, there is an actual
shortage), dental hygiene, medical technology (X-ray

field which will probably continue to grow because of
the increase in the number of pets), pharmacology,
chiropody, or some branch of biology, e.g., entomol
ogy (which is another growing field).
The newer plan will not decrease the amount of
time and enemy which the individual who is plan
ning his future intelligently must expend. On the con
trary, he will do more reading, talk with responsible
and competent men, and use every available method
to find out more about himself and about the world
of work The task of helping the student of today make
a rational vocational choice is one of the responsibili
ties of the American university.

an aptitude for engineering, which is far more likely
to be associated with an aptitude in mathematics and

It is not easy to make a rational choice of a voca

to make objective observations which might lead to
meaningful and helpful conclusions. The choice of an
occupation is fraught with such a complexity of fac

In recent years there has developed a movement
to place less emphasis on specific vocations and to give
more consideration to functional groupings of voca

once apparent: the individual finds his problem sim

accurately study and measure wider fields of apti

and possibilities are left for adjustment to changing
conditions and chance factors over which the individual
has no control.
