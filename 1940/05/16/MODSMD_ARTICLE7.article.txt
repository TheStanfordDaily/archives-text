## 
### HAL SHAFER 
Housemothers will not be "forced down the throats" of Stanford fra
ternities.
Based on statements by members of the University administration, this
promise was made to the Interfraternity Council by Bob Moulton, retiring
president, and Pete Whittlesey, newly-elected president, at last night's
meeting at the Kappa Sig

house.
Moulton announced that Dean of
Men John Bunn, who has recently
promoted the highly controversial
issue for adoption by Stanford fra
ternities, is sending a letter to all
houses revealing that he has "no in
tention at all of forcing housemoth
ers into the houses," and that the
letter will present Dean Bunn's
stand.
PLAN MAGAZINE
"If any house has a housemother
it will be a voluntary proposition,"
Moulton promised.
Feeling that the question of "Hall
or Row" is inevitable for freshmen,
and in order to present a fair pic
ture of fraternity life and finances,
the Council passed a recommenda
tion to the Interfraternity Board of
Control that an additional $55 be
voted to the Interfraternity Maga
zine.
Plans for the magazine, first of its
kind to bo published at. Stanford,
were presented by Harold Shafer,
co-editor wtih Bob Plate, Delt pres
ident. The magazine will be distrib
uted to all freshmen early next fall
quarter, and sent to their families
some time before pledging. The pub
lication will go to press within 10
days, Shafer announced.
RUSH DAYS LISTED
A total of 27 rush periods on 14
separate days will comprise the
rushing agenda for the 1940-41 sea
son, as passed by the Council last
night.
Preference dinner will be held
Thursday, Nov. 16, with pledging
and the pledge prom Friday, Nov.
17. The program as passed by the
Council is only tentative, and must
be okayed by the Board of Control,
according to Whittlesey.
Whittlesey reminded members of
the .Council that present freshman
pledges must have at least a C aver
age to move into the house next fall.
