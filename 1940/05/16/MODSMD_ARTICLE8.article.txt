# Lunchers Hear Of Travel Tour
## 
### 
"There wasn't a happier man in
the world than I when we boarded
the ship pointed toward the U.SA.
last fall." avowed Stanley Sharp to
Lunch Clubbers yesterday.
Giving peppered glimpses of Eu
rope in the summer of 1939, the*
Dean of Men's assistant traced the
travels of the Stanford group over
the continent.
"I was ready to go home when we
got to Munich. We had seen two
German women to every man work
ing in the fields for the Reich. We
had seen ten French women to ev
ery man in the fields of France.
WAR PREMONITION
"There were fewer men in the
German factories and material was
being used up as fast as it was being
gathered. Boys in the counterpart, to
our CCC were learning to digâ€”on
the Seigfried Line, only to mention
a few of the examples of war pre
monition," said Mr. Sharp.
Examples cited proving the un
rest, included the noticeable drop in
the British travelers. A guide was
quoted as saying, "the people are
scared to death." The German Tan
nenburg festival celebration was
cancelled.
WHAT NEXT?
"At first it seemed to us that war
could not be in the minds of the
people," puzzled Mr. Sharp. "Why
should Italy be building the great
subway for a fair in 1942? Why
should the great marble coliseum be
in construction for the Olympics of
1944'."'
