### WILSON CANNON 
DINNER table load of Farm
men were following the usual
lunch routine yesterday. A quiet
radio was whispering of "moon,
bloom, soon," and on and on. Ev
eryone was happy in a noisy, collec
tive way.
The music cut out. A news com
mentator cut in with the latest news
of the day.
For the first time in at least three
years, that group left dessert shim
mering on the table, clustered about
the radio, and listened silently for
15 full minutes.
In every mind was the thought:
"Oh would some power the giftie
gie us, to see ourselves . . . one
year from now."
Dessert topic of conversation was
the speech broadcast yesterday
morning by President Roosevelt.
The Presidential message was deliv
ered in person to a joint session of
Congress.
Mr. Roosevelt's opening words
set the tenor of his address.
"These are ominous times," he
said, "days whose swift and shak
ing developments force every neu
tral nation to look to its own de
fenses in the light of new fac
tors."
But more important to at least
one dinner group was the Presiden
tial phrase:
"We stand not. only ready to spend
millions for defense, but to give our
service and even our lives for our
American liberties."

Rooseveltian phrases,
however, gave no one even the
barest hints that America would be
caught in the mesh of World War 11.
Rather was his message a gratify
ing one. With Congress playing a
supporting role, Mr. Roosevelt told
the world that this nation would
never be caught short because it was
not i"eady.
Primary purpose of the address
yesterday was to ask Congress for
a program of 50,000 fighting planes
calling for over one billion dol
lars to put America on a war
footing.
A few Congressional wiseacres
chuckled as Mr. Roosevelt said
that America was within easy
range of the modern bombing
plane.
But the preparedness message
struck most of the joint session like
a bombshell. Congressmen and the
galleries burst into cheers as the
President said that his program, if
consumatcd, would give America
world supremacy in the air.
The program of 50,000 planes
would fill Ameincan hangars with
more aricraft than the fleets of Ger
many and the Allies combined.

AÂ® America's president urged a |
program designed to ward off
threats of any air attack, Britain's
war cabinet moved to safeguard the
home front from a similar danger.
Jn England's case, however, the dan
ger is of the present.
More than 21)0,000 men and boys
unfit for front line fighting had al
ready volunteered for local defense
duty to meet a threatened German
bombing-parachute troop invasion
of the British Isles.
These volunteer troops, and the
official police force, are stationed in
strategic points throughout the na
tion. Guns and uniforms have been
issued this force.
Decidedly humorus, yet indica
tive of the stress placed upon pre
paredness. was another govern
mental order.
The Ministry of Ilonie Security
requested private motorists to re
move sparkplugs and other parts
from all automobiles during the j
hours from dusk to dawn. This
move is aimed at preventing their
use by possible enemy parachut
ist troops.
Turn-and-about was fair, play for
the British last night as they loosed
their greatest air force of the war to
inflict "widespread damage" on Nazi
holdings in Belgium.
Nazi troop concentrations and
strategic German-held bridges were
subjected to severe bombing raids
with great effect.
