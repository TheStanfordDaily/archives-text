WASHINGTON, May 1G (UP).—
President Roosevelt today asked
Congress for a program of 50,000
fighting planes—more than all the
aircraft of Germany and the Allies
combined—in a preparedness mes
sage calling for an additional
$1,182,000,000 to put the nation on a
war footing.
He delivered the message in per
son to a joint session, warning grim
ly the United States does not in
tend to be caught short like other
nations which have been overrun by
the enemy because they were not
ready to fight..
After outlining this nation's de
fense needs, he said:
"For the permanent record I ask
Congress not to take any action
which would in any way hamper or
df'lay the delivery of American
njrtde planes to foreign nations
which have ordered them, or seek to
purchase more planes. That, from
the point of view of our national
defense, would be extremely short
sighted."
Congressional leaders responded
promptly and began turning the
legislative wheels which will make
the necessary money available and
put the program in the production
stage.
