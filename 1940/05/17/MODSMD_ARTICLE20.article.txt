# Legislature Seeks Relief Integration
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO, May 16 (UP). â€”
The legislature tonight presented
Gov. Culbert Olson with a formal
resolution urging him to issue a new
special session call for integration of
all welfare, employment and relief
activities of the state.
The resolution passed 26 to 4 in
the Senate and 46 to 24 in the As
sembly. Despite the vote of a ma
jority of the lawmakers, however,
Olson was not expected to accede to
the request, because of strong ob
jections to several provisions of the
integration proposal.
