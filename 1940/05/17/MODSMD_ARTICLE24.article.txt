# Oregonians Go To Polls Today
## 
### 
PORTLAND, Ore., May 16 (UP).
â€”Oregon voters will go to the polls
tomorrow in what has been forecast
as one of the quietest Presidential
primary elections in two decades.
On the Democratic Presidential
ticket, only the names of President
Roosevelt and John Nance Garner
appear. Although a Garner-for-
President boom gathered momentum
the last few days, Roosevelt is ex
pected to have little trouble in
claiming the state's 10 Democratic
delegates to the national conven
tion.
Native son Charles L. McNary,
Senate minority leader, is unopposed
for the Republican Presidential
nomination. Advocates of racket
buster Thomas E. Dewey were seek
ing write-in votes, largely in hope
of obtaining the McNary delegates
should the senator choose to re
lease them.
