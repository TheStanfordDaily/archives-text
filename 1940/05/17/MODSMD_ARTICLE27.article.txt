# Allies Claim Nazi Drive Into Belgium Halted By Planes, Tanks, Men
## British Retake Louvain in Three Hard Assaults 
### 
PARIS, May 16 (UP).—Furious
Allied counter-attacks employing the
full power of bombers, tanks and
land forces have halted the German
drive through Belgium, late reports
from the front said tonight.
In three desperate assaults, the
British armies defending Brussels
recaptured the shattered university
city of Louvain from the Nazi le
gions and drove them back to their
original positions.
Generals Henri Giraud and Charles
Hunziger, commanding the two
French armies fighting back the
German break-through at the river
Meuse, telegraphed French head
quarters tiiey controlled the situa
tion after desperate counter-assaults.
MAGINOT PUSH HALTED
Isolated German mechanized de
tachments which earlier had infil
trated between Allied forces in an
audacious effort to cut behind the
Maginot Line were said to have been
destroyed.
The nightly French war commu
nique said the battle "continues un
abated on the same wide front." The
communique did not mention the
depth of the front but French mili
tary spokesmen said flatly the gen
eral positions were the same as 24
hours ago and the Germans had
made no major advance on any
front.
Allied and German commanders
rushed all available reinforcements
of men and materiel into the strug
gle already engaging an estimated
2,000,000 men. Casualties on both
sides were terrible, with German
losses believed considerably heavier
than those of the defending forces,
except in instances of Allied coun
ter-assaults.
THREE FIGHTS GO ON
Three battles—all a part of the
gigantic general engagement in
which Germany expects to crush Al
lied resistance and start the "be
ginning of the end" — were being
fought with every resource at the
command of the opposing forces.
They were:
1. The main German assault on
a wide front in the Namur-Dinant
sector, led by roaring .'{o-ton tanks
and the pick of the Nazi mechan
ized divisions. This was designed
for the double purpose of smashing
Allied main forces and cutting off
Allied armies defending Brussels
and Antwerp by driving a wedge
between Belgium and France.
2. A terrific German attack . r »0
miles southward below the shell
blasted city of Sedan in a desper
ate effort to crack the Maginot
Line.
The German drive against
Allied forces—mostly British and
Belgian units—defending Brussels
and Antwerp on the northern wing
of the wide battlcfront.
Both sides appeared to be re
grouping and reorganizing their
forces in a swift war of movement in
preparation for the decisive "main
show" which within a matter of days
may spell victory or defeat in Bel
gium.

forces in a swift war of movement in

PARIS, May 16 (UP).—Furious
Allied counter-attacks employing the
full power of bombers, tanks and
land forces have halted the German
drive through Belgium, late reports
from the front said tonight.
In three desperate assaults, the
British armies defending Brussels
recaptured the shattered university
city of Louvain from the Nazi le
gions and drove them back to their
original positions.
Generals Henri Giraud and Charles
Hunziger, commanding the two
French armies fighting back the
German break-through at the river
Meuse, telegraphed French head
quarters tiiey controlled the situa
tion after desperate counter-assaults.
MAGINOT PUSH HALTED
Isolated German mechanized de
tachments which earlier had infil
trated between Allied forces in an
audacious effort to cut behind the
Maginot Line were said to have been
destroyed.
The nightly French war commu
nique said the battle "continues un
abated on the same wide front." The
communique did not mention the
depth of the front but French mili
tary spokesmen said flatly the gen
eral positions were the same as 24
hours ago and the Germans had
made no major advance on any
front.
Allied and German commanders
rushed all available reinforcements
of men and materiel into the strug
gle already engaging an estimated
2,000,000 men. Casualties on both
sides were terrible, with German
losses believed considerably heavier
than those of the defending forces,
except in instances of Allied coun
ter-assaults.
THREE FIGHTS GO ON
Three battles—all a part of the
gigantic general engagement in
which Germany expects to crush Al
lied resistance and start the "be
ginning of the end" — were being
fought with every resource at the
command of the opposing forces.
They were:
1. The main German assault on
a wide front in the Namur-Dinant
sector, led by roaring .'{o-ton tanks
and the pick of the Nazi mechan
ized divisions. This was designed
for the double purpose of smashing
Allied main forces and cutting off
Allied armies defending Brussels
and Antwerp by driving a wedge
between Belgium and France.
2. A terrific German attack . r »0
miles southward below the shell
blasted city of Sedan in a desper
ate effort to crack the Maginot
Line.
The German drive against
Allied forces—mostly British and
Belgian units—defending Brussels
and Antwerp on the northern wing
of the wide battlcfront.
