# Roosevelt Speech Boosts Market
## 
### 
NEW YORK. May 16 (UP).â€”Pres
ident Roosevelt's emergency defense
message today touched off a gen
eral buying movement in the stock
market that boomed prices in the
aviation, steel, ordnance and ship
building shares.
The market churned erratically
through the early dealings as trad
ers sought to adjust their commit
ments to the rapidly shifting Euro
pean war developments. Demand
broadened quickly following the
Presidential message, and prices
swung forward in a last-hour ad
vance that swamped the Exchange
ticker facilities and lifted the pivotal
war stocks $2 to more than $6 a
share.
