# Hobby-minded Business Grad Blends Aromas, Raises Frogs
## 
### JEFF LITTLEBOY 
Son o lads put themselves through college by hashing, and others fumble
throug't dusty archives on Uncle Sam's payroll, hut here's one who's
unique.
He'; Bob Maiden, a business school grad who makes perfumes as a sort
of pec iniary avocation. He sells through agents on the campus, and he

estimates his perfumery purveying
has ps id about one third of his
Slanfoid expenses.
Bob entered Stanford as a junior
transfer irom Long Beach Junior
College, where he had been experi
menting in organic chemistry in his
spare time. He hit upon perfume
blendii 4 as combining the nicer
smells with the correct amount of
lab tin .oiing; now he can undersell
what h ' terms the "big boys" in the
industry by about one-third to one
half.
PILL I QTTLES
Here - how ho does it. Ho opens a
little suitcase filled with diminutive
brown bottles similar to those your
Aunt Matilda keeps her digestion
pills in, all numbered consecutively.
Each 1 us some essential oil in it- -
sandalwood Irom Mysore, India, oii
of Bei ;amot from Italy, or attar of
roses from Bulgaria.
Witl this oil base as a foundation,
!ie ex) ; riment.v with the odors until
he strikes one that suits his fancy,
or he ■; an exotic appeal that he
think. c may have a market. With a
iixath e to hold the perfume and to
check the volatility, he mixes into
the p< tion enough alcohol to make a
tincture. Then the "little breath of
!ar C; thay is put away in bottles to
age f( a year. After that, the scent
is rea<!y for sale at ro much a dram.
Sor.e of Bob's glamorous concoc
tions have been given equally glam
orouj names by his wife, Norma.
Such titles as "Cloister," "Caravan,"
and "Midnight Sailing" have been
the r suits of a quiet l\our of sniffing
and dreaming over the bottles.
FOR 12 \ RESEARCH
Ini ideal ally, Bob met his wife
when he was head of the Speakers'
Bun iu. Norma, interested in Bob's
liobl y, used to go out on trips and
give talks on perfumery.
"Used to get quite a lot of busi
ness- that way, too," mused Bob.
"So:no of the club women still write
to for orders of their favorite per
fume."
S ime of the formulas that he uses
come out of books in which he did a
little research. Sometimes he uses
ihe formula as is. other times he
utilizes the basic mixture and con
cocts hi. own original scent. The re
sul ing peri umes have anywhere
ire n live to twenty oils in them, he
saj :f.
FLORAL PERFUMES
The current fashion trend to floral
prints -in dresses gave Bob the idea
of distilling some floral odors to
match — heliotrope, red roses, and
many others were the outcome. And
it's really no trick at all for Bob to
mix up a scent to the individual
taste, indicative, in a subtle way, of
the wearer's personality.
European strife, Bob says, has
raised Merry Nell with the prices of
essential oils, which are distilled
f.'om flowers, bark, mosses, and
whatnot. Grasz, France, is one place
i; particular that has felt the pinch,
Bob's flair for original and re
i unc rative hobbies put him into the
I .og-farming business once in South
" an Nuys. This was just before he
i imo up to Stanford, and he was
« uite successful in moving his leap
iig livestock to wholesalers. Bob
resumes the frogs went to restau
i ants and biological labs.
So. i ' no surprise at all to find
t lat Bob was a social science major
: s an undergraduate, regards organic
< hemistry as a h> bby, and plans to
• > into industrial management when
1c graduated from Business School.

Son o lads put themselves through college by hashing, and others fumble
throug't dusty archives on Uncle Sam's payroll, hut here's one who's
unique.
He'; Bob Maiden, a business school grad who makes perfumes as a sort
of pec iniary avocation. He sells through agents on the campus, and he

estimates his perfumery purveying
has ps id about one third of his
Slanfoid expenses.
Bob entered Stanford as a junior
transfer irom Long Beach Junior
College, where he had been experi
menting in organic chemistry in his
spare time. He hit upon perfume
blendii 4 as combining the nicer
smells with the correct amount of
lab tin .oiing; now he can undersell
what h ' terms the "big boys" in the
industry by about one-third to one
half.
PILL I QTTLES
Here - how ho does it. Ho opens a
little suitcase filled with diminutive
brown bottles similar to those your
Aunt Matilda keeps her digestion
pills in, all numbered consecutively.
Each 1 us some essential oil in it- -
sandalwood Irom Mysore, India, oii
of Bei ;amot from Italy, or attar of
roses from Bulgaria.
Witl this oil base as a foundation,
!ie ex) ; riment.v with the odors until
he strikes one that suits his fancy,
or he ■; an exotic appeal that he
think. c may have a market. With a
iixath e to hold the perfume and to
check the volatility, he mixes into
the p< tion enough alcohol to make a
tincture. Then the "little breath of
!ar C; thay is put away in bottles to
age f( a year. After that, the scent
is rea<!y for sale at ro much a dram.
Sor.e of Bob's glamorous concoc
tions have been given equally glam
orouj names by his wife, Norma.
Such titles as "Cloister," "Caravan,"
and "Midnight Sailing" have been
the r suits of a quiet l\our of sniffing
and dreaming over the bottles.
FOR 12 \ RESEARCH
Ini ideal ally, Bob met his wife
when he was head of the Speakers'
Bun iu. Norma, interested in Bob's
liobl y, used to go out on trips and
give talks on perfumery.
"Used to get quite a lot of busi
ness- that way, too," mused Bob.
"So:no of the club women still write
to for orders of their favorite per
fume."
S ime of the formulas that he uses
come out of books in which he did a
little research. Sometimes he uses
ihe formula as is. other times he
utilizes the basic mixture and con
cocts hi. own original scent. The re
sul ing peri umes have anywhere
ire n live to twenty oils in them, he
saj :f.
FLORAL PERFUMES
The current fashion trend to floral
prints -in dresses gave Bob the idea
of distilling some floral odors to
match — heliotrope, red roses, and
many others were the outcome. And
it's really no trick at all for Bob to
mix up a scent to the individual
taste, indicative, in a subtle way, of
the wearer's personality.
European strife, Bob says, has
raised Merry Nell with the prices of
essential oils, which are distilled
f.'om flowers, bark, mosses, and
whatnot. Grasz, France, is one place
i; particular that has felt the pinch,
Bob's flair for original and re
i unc rative hobbies put him into the
I .og-farming business once in South
" an Nuys. This was just before he
i imo up to Stanford, and he was
« uite successful in moving his leap
iig livestock to wholesalers. Bob
resumes the frogs went to restau
i ants and biological labs.
So. i ' no surprise at all to find
t lat Bob was a social science major
: s an undergraduate, regards organic
< hemistry as a h> bby, and plans to
• > into industrial management when
1c graduated from Business School.
