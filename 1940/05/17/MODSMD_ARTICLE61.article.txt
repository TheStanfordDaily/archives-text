# Bookstore Plans Rebate Change
## Student Purchasers To Save Own Slips 
### 
A new rebate system, under which ;
students will save their own rebate
slips and turn them in all at once |
instead of depositing them haphaz- :
ardly in collection boxes, went into j
effect at the Stanford Bookstore yes- j
terday.
Under this system the Bookstore i
will issue envelopes to students in ,
which they will save their rebate !
slips, and turn them in annually. !
This will allow the student to know !
at any time what the amount of his
purchases has been and approxi- 1
mstely what his rebate will be.
The system will also save the j
bookstore the expense of segregat- !
ing and filing the slips, which will j
make the rebate percentage larger.
Undei - the present system many of
tlie illegible slips are discarded.
The change will not affect this
year's rebates up to yesterday, how
ever. They will be paid in the old t
way, beginning May 27.
The envelope system has been in
effect at the Universities of Wash- :
ington, Oregon, and California, |
proving very successful there.
