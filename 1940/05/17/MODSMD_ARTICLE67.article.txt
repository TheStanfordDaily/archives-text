Misfortune is striking at the Tro
jans' track team about as hard as it
has been at Stanford's. The other
day Bob Peoples slipped and fell on
the steps of his fraternity house anc 1
broke his wrist on the flipper which
has been good enough to throw the
javelin out over 220 feet about ev
ery time he goes to the firing line.
It was also unfortunate (hat we
wrote a story yesterday which
made it look as if Rill Llling'ton
and the trackmen took a fiendish
delight in having their opponents
break hones, pull muscles, etc. It
was unintended, we assure you.
Peoples, who divides his athletic
time between playing a devastating
game of fullback for Howard Jones
varsity and tossing the javelin, i;
one of the finest fellows on the
Irojan track team and has every
one's respect.
The likeable Rob has an Ameri
can record for the javelin of
something like 234 feet, and any
one who has seen him toss the
spear realizes that there is quite a
hit more to the event than throw
ing. IIi», like our own Rob Stone,
uses the Finnish method id' toss
ing. It's too intricate to describe
on paper without the aid of some
visible object; so all we suggest is
that ii you want to see how he
does it. wait around until next
year when Bobby should be throw
ing just as well as ever.
Despite People's injury, the Tro
jans don't lost* their potential firs*
place, for they have Hugo DeGroot
brother of Stanford's Dud, who last
year coached football at San Jost
State and is now back at Roehestei
in New York. Hugo defeated Peo
ples at the Fresno Relays by a frac
tion of an inch, just under 220 feet
However, Peoples' being out doe.'
relieve the Trojans of a sure sec
ond, and now Stone can step in anc
give Stanford those needed seconc
place points in the conference meet
next Saturday.
Cut, whoa, there! What about
Royd Crown. th«> Oregon Univer
sity tosser. Just about forgot
about him. He's good enough to
beat DeGroot or even Peoples.
And lie's been burning up the
Northern Division in his favorite
event. j +
* <1 ii! J 1
PACIFIC COAST javelin throw
ing has always been top-notch ii
you look back into the files.
California has had a couple of
220-foot tossers in Churchill and
Water bury, and when they weren't
throwing. Stanford had its own
Johnny Mot tram winging the spear
out there. Oregon has had its long
string of javelin men starting with
Jimmy DeMers. who threw in the
1 ffliS Olympics in Amsterdam, and
more recently Jim Dancri and
Rohh.\ Parke, a left - handed
thrower.
Bui now along comes Brown, and
what is even more remarkable about
his throwing is that he has no thumb
on his right hand. According to my
Oregon correspondent, the amazin;
Brown grips the spear between his
first two fingers.
Brown's best this year is 21!)
feet, but last spring he threw
2111' against Peoples the same
day Peoples threw 234: l~s.
Maybe in this kind of competition
and with an arm which isn't sore.
Bob Stone can rise to the same
heights he did against Cal. throw a
javelin oul around 230, and grab
himself a Stanford record as well as
some fame.
NO TRAM in the nation can boast.
I'll venture, as strong a golf team
as. the Farm has had Ibis season. All
of 10 men will be fighting for those
six choice positions on the team
which goes back to Vermont's Ekwa
nok Links late in June, and any
combination of these men could win
ihe team title.
Rut alas and alack, only six and
Coach Eddie Twiggs can go so
around the first of June there's to
be an all-important, spine-tingling
elimination tourney in medal com
position. So it'll be a case of who
can stand up under pressure to
see who'll be Stanford's repre
sentatives.
Wednesday Jack Showalter, a
senior and veteran of last year's
eastern trip, came along to upset
Don Kennedy, No. 2 golfer, who,
along with Warren Berl, has been
listed already to go — no matter
what.

Misfortune is striking at the Tro
jans' track team about as hard as it
has been at Stanford's. The other
day Bob Peoples slipped and fell on
the steps of his fraternity house anc 1
broke his wrist on the flipper which
has been good enough to throw the
javelin out over 220 feet about ev
ery time he goes to the firing line.
It was also unfortunate (hat we
wrote a story yesterday which
made it look as if Rill Llling'ton
and the trackmen took a fiendish
delight in having their opponents
break hones, pull muscles, etc. It
was unintended, we assure you.
Peoples, who divides his athletic
time between playing a devastating
game of fullback for Howard Jones
varsity and tossing the javelin, i;
one of the finest fellows on the
Irojan track team and has every
one's respect.
The likeable Rob has an Ameri
can record for the javelin of
something like 234 feet, and any
one who has seen him toss the
spear realizes that there is quite a
hit more to the event than throw
ing. IIi», like our own Rob Stone,

on paper without the aid of some
visible object; so all we suggest is
that ii you want to see how he
does it. wait around until next
year when Bobby should be throw
ing just as well as ever.
Despite People's injury, the Tro
jans don't lost* their potential firs*
place, for they have Hugo DeGroot
brother of Stanford's Dud, who last
year coached football at San Jost
State and is now back at Roehestei
in New York. Hugo defeated Peo
ples at the Fresno Relays by a frac
tion of an inch, just under 220 feet
However, Peoples' being out doe.'

PACIFIC COAST javelin throw
ing has always been top-notch ii
you look back into the files.
California has had a couple of
220-foot tossers in Churchill and
Water bury, and when they weren't
throwing. Stanford had its own
Johnny Mot tram winging the spear
out there. Oregon has had its long
string of javelin men starting with
Jimmy DeMers. who threw in the
1 ffliS Olympics in Amsterdam, and
more recently Jim Dancri and
Rohh.\ Parke, a left - handed
thrower.
Bui now along comes Brown, and
what is even more remarkable about
his throwing is that he has no thumb
on his right hand. According to my
Oregon correspondent, the amazin;
Brown grips the spear between his
first two fingers.
Brown's best this year is 21!)
feet, but last spring he threw
2111' against Peoples the same
day Peoples threw 234: l~s.
Maybe in this kind of competition
and with an arm which isn't sore.
Bob Stone can rise to the same
heights he did against Cal. throw a
javelin oul around 230, and grab
himself a Stanford record as well as
some fame.
NO TRAM in the nation can boast.
I'll venture, as strong a golf team
as. the Farm has had Ibis season. All
of 10 men will be fighting for those
six choice positions on the team

Rut alas and alack, only six and
Coach Eddie Twiggs can go so
around the first of June there's to
be an all-important, spine-tingling
elimination tourney in medal com

can stand up under pressure to

jans' track team about as hard as it
has been at Stanford's. The other
day Bob Peoples slipped and fell on
the steps of his fraternity house anc 1
broke his wrist on the flipper which
has been good enough to throw the
javelin out over 220 feet about ev
ery time he goes to the firing line.
It was also unfortunate (hat we
wrote a story yesterday which
made it look as if Rill Llling'ton
and the trackmen took a fiendish
delight in having their opponents
break hones, pull muscles, etc. It
was unintended, we assure you.
Peoples, who divides his athletic
time between playing a devastating
game of fullback for Howard Jones
varsity and tossing the javelin, i;
one of the finest fellows on the
Irojan track team and has every
one's respect.
The likeable Rob has an Ameri
can record for the javelin of
something like 234 feet, and any
one who has seen him toss the
spear realizes that there is quite a
hit more to the event than throw
ing. IIi», like our own Rob Stone,
uses the Finnish method id' toss
ing. It's too intricate to describe
on paper without the aid of some
visible object; so all we suggest is
that ii you want to see how he
does it. wait around until next
year when Bobby should be throw
ing just as well as ever.
Despite People's injury, the Tro
jans don't lost* their potential firs*
place, for they have Hugo DeGroot
brother of Stanford's Dud, who last
year coached football at San Jost
State and is now back at Roehestei
in New York. Hugo defeated Peo
ples at the Fresno Relays by a frac
tion of an inch, just under 220 feet
However, Peoples' being out doe.'
relieve the Trojans of a sure sec
ond, and now Stone can step in anc
give Stanford those needed seconc
place points in the conference meet
next Saturday.
Cut, whoa, there! What about
Royd Crown. th«> Oregon Univer
sity tosser. Just about forgot
about him. He's good enough to
beat DeGroot or even Peoples.
And lie's been burning up the
Northern Division in his favorite
event. j +
* <1 ii! J 1
PACIFIC COAST javelin throw
ing has always been top-notch ii
you look back into the files.
California has had a couple of
220-foot tossers in Churchill and
Water bury, and when they weren't
throwing. Stanford had its own
Johnny Mot tram winging the spear
out there. Oregon has had its long
string of javelin men starting with
Jimmy DeMers. who threw in the
1 ffliS Olympics in Amsterdam, and
more recently Jim Dancri and
Rohh.\ Parke, a left - handed
thrower.
Bui now along comes Brown, and
what is even more remarkable about
his throwing is that he has no thumb
on his right hand. According to my
Oregon correspondent, the amazin;
Brown grips the spear between his
first two fingers.
Brown's best this year is 21!)
feet, but last spring he threw
2111' against Peoples the same
day Peoples threw 234: l~s.
Maybe in this kind of competition
and with an arm which isn't sore.
Bob Stone can rise to the same
heights he did against Cal. throw a
javelin oul around 230, and grab
himself a Stanford record as well as
some fame.
NO TRAM in the nation can boast.
I'll venture, as strong a golf team
as. the Farm has had Ibis season. All
of 10 men will be fighting for those
six choice positions on the team
which goes back to Vermont's Ekwa
nok Links late in June, and any
combination of these men could win
ihe team title.
Rut alas and alack, only six and
Coach Eddie Twiggs can go so
around the first of June there's to
be an all-important, spine-tingling
elimination tourney in medal com
position. So it'll be a case of who
can stand up under pressure to
see who'll be Stanford's repre
sentatives.
Wednesday Jack Showalter, a
senior and veteran of last year's
eastern trip, came along to upset
Don Kennedy, No. 2 golfer, who,
along with Warren Berl, has been
listed already to go — no matter
what.
