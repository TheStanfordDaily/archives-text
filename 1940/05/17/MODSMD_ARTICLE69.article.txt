# Relay Team Goes South Points For World Mark
## 
### 
Eight Stanford relay men left
fer Los Angeles last night at 7:15
o'clock to run for a still worthy
but lost cause in the Finnish Re
lief Meet, 'tomorrow five field
event men of Coach Bill Elling- j
ton's crew will go up to Berkeley
fer the annual P.A. Meet.
Traveling south are Ernie Clark, j
Charlie Shaw, Les Johnson, and
Uraig Williamson, members of the j
ndian mile relay team. Paul Moore.
,'ack Moore, Burman Skrable, and
31air Hyde, who comprise the Card
wo-mile relay team, will make an !
issault on the national intercolle- |
;icite and world record in this event.
Much like a chain, this two-mile
elay team will be depending on its
■veakest link for success. In its case
t it: the lowest runner who deter
nines whether or not the 1940 Stan- I
old track team makes its fifth im- !
jression on the record books, with
i record in the two-mile relay.
iKRABLF TO RUN
Burman Skrable will be in the ;
pressure position tonight when the j
Cards race for their record. The j
ourlh best Indian half-miler, Bur- |
nan can run only 1:55 — time that |
vould be winning races on a. y nor- ]
nal track team. And if Burman
uns one of his better races around 1
his 1:55 mark, Ellington's distance J
nen will be away for another rec
jrd.
With Paul Moore still untested at j
his distance but capable of at least
1:52.4, Blair Hyde running 1:53.5 and
lack Moore at 1:54 flat, the Cards i
vith a good lap by Skrable could J
lo 7:35.0. This would break by two- |
enths of a second the world record j
et in 1936 in London by an all-star j
\merican team, tl woidd also erase |
he national intercollegiate mark set !
.•arlier in the year by Stanford.
U.S.C.'S STARS
If U.S.C. enters a team which
•ould include such stars as Art !
heading, Leroy Weed, and Louie j
iamperini plus any mediocre half- j
niler, the Indians would have their i
lands full of competition. Whether
>r if' this meet will furnish such I
:ompetition and whether the track I
vill be at all negotiable after a {
avalcade or two of horses has thun- [
iered over it. as part of the gala en
ertainment rente ins to be seen.
SO TROUBLE FORESEEN
The mile relayers should have 1
ittle trouble even though Clyde
Jeffrey will be at home nursing a
.•ramped muscle, for these four can
un about 4:12.5 if they are at all
right.
The Card throw and jump men |
.vho are going to Berkeley tomorrow
ire: Bob Stone, javelin thrower. ;
3ene Kent, broad jump, Jim Lin- !
•oln, high jump, Emerson Ililer, dis
cus, and Ed Tomasso, pole vault.
