# McCue Band, 'Best Yet,' To Highlight Spring Show
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
With a selected audience of guinea pigs, among which were the entire
Stanford track team and Student Body President Ken Cuthbertson, Ram's
Head held the final dress rehearsal for "I'm a Stranglcr Here Myself" last
night. They will act for keeps tonight and tomorrow night in Memorial
Hall starting at 8:15 o'clock.
Most interesting thing about this rehearsal, which naturally cannot be
judged as a finished production, was Art McCue's new band. The group

was excellent, and the music they,
have been given to play is good
both in itself and in the arrange
ment.
DESIGNED FOR CAMPUS
"Strangler" is definitely a campus
show, with plenty of local refer
ences, college students just being
college students, and lots of laugh
lines. However, the set depicting the
Tri-Mu fraternity house is extreme
ly smooth, but not typical in any
sense of the word. A fraternity
would be proud to give a place like
that over to a house mother.
Though scene changes were slow,
this being the first time they'd been
worked out with music cues, it was
obvious from the way the show was
written that it's going to be fast, just
as Bulotti has promised.
BULOTTI'S SPEECH
Bulotti's speech to his preview
audience was pretty good comedy in
itself. With the admonition to
"laugh if it's funny, and boo if it
isn'tâ€”for my sake, boys," he wound
up with the plaintive comment that
maybe having the track team there
wasn't such a good idea, because
"they could get out so fast."
But nobody left, and what's more
they all seemed to be having a darn
good time. It looks like an enter
taining show well worth a Friday
or Saturday evening of anybody's
time.
