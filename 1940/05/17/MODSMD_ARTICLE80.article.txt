# All Purpose Drive
## 
### 
HPHK plan of Cardinals lo allempl a split of next
■"■year's Convalescent Home Drive into two differ
ent quarters will work in exceptionally well with
the scheme proposed in The Daily yesterday favor
ing one yearly all-purpose drive.
Cardinals believes the canvass for cash alone
could I >(" made heller early in the fall quarter when
the campus residents presumably have more ready
money and more of the old college rail. If Cardi
nals and Ex Committee passes any action moving
the cash drive into the fall term, it would be silly
not to include all of the other worthy projects in the
same mo\ e.
In the first place, the best salesmen, both men and
women, would be available. They would not be
afr aid of being overworked through having to do
f - O C
the same job again and again. It is a terrific physical
and mental strain, as well as a great waste of study
ing time, for I lie collectors. Once the best of them
were, sure that Stanford s yet unnamed Community
Chest type project would be the first and last of
their mooching activities for the year, t|u'v would
undoubtedly work extra long and vigorouslv to
attain their desired goals.
Secondly, the campus residents, the ultimate vic
tims. will relish the thought of being approached
only once. Mecau-c the best collectors contact them
and because there will be a favorite charity for
every pockelbook. it seems likclv lo assume the all
purpose round-up will usually end in unprecedented
success.
Enema Hall, for example, housing over 500 in
mates. game just a few cents more than eight dollars
lo the Home Drive cause this vear. This is no rc
licetion on the .freshmen, however, but must be
alributed to poor salesmanship, a sparsilv of prod
nets to sell, and inierior education on the part of
the leaders who had goii" before.
Kncina Hall, under the Daily plan, could and
would fii\e well over a thousand dollars.
Cardinals can still conduct its earl\ spring quar
ter Convalescent Home \\ in conjunction with
llack-to-llie-Eanii. Nothing will be left out except
the gruesome details of billing direct at the campus
dollar, a task which will already have been taken
care of in the fall quarters all-purpose drive.
Cardinals. The Daily, and Ex Committee should
pel together.
