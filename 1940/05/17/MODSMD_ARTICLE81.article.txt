### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
SPRING (SHOW) IS HERE
"QUIET!"
Director Bulotti roars at liis company as it as
sembles in the Green Room for a brush-up on the
fourth scene. "Winters." he exclaims, wagging a note
•beet at Dana "Mesmer" Winters, "if I have told you
once I have told you a dozen times, do not cross right
in front of Cefaratti!"
And energetically the Spring Show's boss upbraids,
cajoles, and compliments his troupers. "If you remem
ber these things," ho predicts, "you will have a top
notch show. If you forget them, you will have a fair
show."
(Murmur, murmur, murmur. And Shorty "F.D.R."
Grannis makes an acid remark.)
"Quiet!" And the brush-up goes on. The Green
Room and the stage and the backstage and the house
ire sufficiently activated to make one forget about the
biggest battle in history and the President's pre-war
message. The Spring Show is in the process.
Packed with gags, really funny men, and Pat Ber
nard, this year's Spring Show looks as though it will
top a well-known list of Stanford-hits for which Bu
lotti and Harry "Top of the Libe Muheim are earning
a sizeable reputation.

NTERTAINING as the show may be, however, its
greatest contribution to Stanford's montage of ac
tivities is its anti-bromidial satire. We use enough trite
expressions and take enough things hyper-seriously
to contract that deadly disease which afflicts anyone
who thinks or accepts more than he laughs: serious
itis, or self-narcosis.
But the people down at Memorial Hall these nights
have some different ideas. They have a good anti
toxin for seriousitis. They have a satire in the Stan
ford style. And even accounting professors, one of
whom is murdered in the show, should appreciate the
humor.
They say a politician is all things to all people, to
quote an old trite one. Well, the Spring Show and the
Gaieties are all humors to all the campus. From pants
less belly laughs to satirical needling, and from Three
Star Hennessy (the detective) to some of the best
singing Stanford shows have ever had—the Spring
Show has them all.
Everyone ought to see it. If for no other reason,
it will create some badly needed laughter— to counter
act the local wave of war heat.

lotti and Harry "Top of the Libe Muheim are earning
a sizeable reputation.

NTERTAINING as the show may be, however, its
greatest contribution to Stanford's montage of ac
tivities is its anti-bromidial satire. We use enough trite
expressions and take enough things hyper-seriously
to contract that deadly disease which afflicts anyone
who thinks or accepts more than he laughs: serious
itis, or self-narcosis.
But the people down at Memorial Hall these nights
have some different ideas. They have a good anti
toxin for seriousitis. They have a satire in the Stan
ford style. And even accounting professors, one of
whom is murdered in the show, should appreciate the
humor.
They say a politician is all things to all people, to
quote an old trite one. Well, the Spring Show and the
Gaieties are all humors to all the campus. From pants
less belly laughs to satirical needling, and from Three
Star Hennessy (the detective) to some of the best
singing Stanford shows have ever had—the Spring
Show has them all.
Everyone ought to see it. If for no other reason,
it will create some badly needed laughter— to counter
act the local wave of war heat.
SPRING (SHOW) IS HERE
"QUIET!"
Director Bulotti roars at liis company as it as
sembles in the Green Room for a brush-up on the
fourth scene. "Winters." he exclaims, wagging a note
•beet at Dana "Mesmer" Winters, "if I have told you
once I have told you a dozen times, do not cross right
in front of Cefaratti!"
And energetically the Spring Show's boss upbraids,
cajoles, and compliments his troupers. "If you remem
ber these things," ho predicts, "you will have a top
notch show. If you forget them, you will have a fair
show."
(Murmur, murmur, murmur. And Shorty "F.D.R."
Grannis makes an acid remark.)
"Quiet!" And the brush-up goes on. The Green
Room and the stage and the backstage and the house
ire sufficiently activated to make one forget about the
biggest battle in history and the President's pre-war
message. The Spring Show is in the process.
Packed with gags, really funny men, and Pat Ber
nard, this year's Spring Show looks as though it will
top a well-known list of Stanford-hits for which Bu
lotti and Harry "Top of the Libe Muheim are earning
a sizeable reputation.
