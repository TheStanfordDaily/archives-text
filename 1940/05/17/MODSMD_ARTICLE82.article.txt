EDITOR, SIR:
While I heartily disagree with Bill Blair's atti
tude regarding sending America into this European
"mess," I agree with him that The Daily or anyone
else has no right to call him "hysterical," unintelligent,
'punch drunk," etc. This is not the first time The
Daily has been small enough to insult the intelligence
of proponents of the opposite view.
