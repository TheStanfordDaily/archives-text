# IN UNION THERE IS PEACE

| 'HE EDITOR, SIR:
Wherever I go to talk things over about the War
I always find people who gloomily predict, "We'll be
dragged into it pretty quick now." But very few look
at it the way The Daily columnists do. Very few seem
to sit down and quietly think it out, but seem to allow
themselves to be carried along in the current of
despair.
Therefore, it seems to me that all of us, and espe
cially you fellows who are in a position to do the most
good, should do all we can to counteract this feeling.
We should point out the facts of our internal condi
tions as you have done, and we should also call atten
tion to the fact that we won't be dragged into any
thing that we don't want to be dragged into if we can
just get together and make a big enough noise about
it. At least we can try.
Fred Stettner
