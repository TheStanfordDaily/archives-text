# Another Man's View
## MY FORCED CHOICE 
### DR. THOMAS A. STOREY Director of School of Hygiene Physical Education 
A FTER 48 years of direct and indirect participation
in the affairs of Stanford, I find it impossible to
decide which of my ''Another Man's Views" would be
a wise choice for a three or four hundred word state
ment in the Stanford Daily. My opportunities for
views of Stanford have been numerous and many of
them "close up." By the end of this coming June, the
Storey family of five will have nine Stanford degrees.
Four of them are degrees of Bachelor of Arts through
which we have looked intimately at undergraduate
Stanford. I have viewed the Alumni Association as a
member for 44 years and observed Stanford as one
of the University staff for a total of 24 years. And per
haps you remember that I noted in the Stanford
broadcast recently that during this period I was given
many opportunities with others to take a participat
ing part in various local, state, national and interna
tional organizations concerned with problems and pro
grams of physical education (including athletics),
school hygiene, social hygiene and college hygiene,
and that the net results of this experience were used
: or the organization and operation of the School of
•vhich I am General Director here at Stanford.

jj BECAUSE of all these experiences, I have many
"views" on Stanford—its students, alumni, fac
ulty, President, trustees, activities and programs, its
standards, ideals and educational purposes, and its fu
ture—views that I must respect. Some of these views
of mine, skillfully written, might interest the readers
of the Daily, but I am too near all of them to know
which view to choose.
The hideous situations abroad, however, make this
choice for me. I'd far rather write of my convinced
belief that, despite disappointing exceptions, intelli
gent Stanford youth is naturally wholesome; that. Stan
ford alumni, again despite disappointing exceptions,
will continue generation after generation to furnish
wise and effective leadership in the affairs of this
country and of the world; that the Stanford Faculty,
President and Trustees are here because Stanford stu
dents are here and that they are and must be concerned
primarily with student welfare and with the education
of the student for prepared leadership in human af
fairs; that the School of which I am executive head
is making an extraordinary contribution, and if per
mitted to do so, will continue to make such a contri
bution in the help it gives young men and young
women toward professional educational effectiveness
as scientifically informed, competent leaders in the
field of hygiene and physical education—leaders who
do their own thinking and make their own decisions.

University purposes, however, are all con
cerned with preparation of Stanford youth for the
life of the self-respecting citizen in a free American
democracy, dominated bv the ideals of our Declara
tion of Independence, our Constitution, and our Bill
of Rights, none of which is possible under the govern
ments that now ruthlessly destroy all these precious
democratic ideals. With my compelling belief that
Peace is the only quality of social environment that
can safeguard this world for the life of free people, I
must admit that if such a world is worth living for. it
is worth planning for. working for, sacrificing for. and.
if necessary, worth fighting for. All the great univer
sities of Europe, some of them centuries old. are now
destroyed or reduced to shadows of their past. If we
are to maintain our culture, our civilization and our
standards of government and of life, we at Stanford
must leave nothing undone that can be done to protect
and defend the priceless resources that give us our
freedom. But. we are not united. We are not prepared.
We are not ready.

"views" on Stanford—its students, alumni, fac
ulty, President, trustees, activities and programs, its
standards, ideals and educational purposes, and its fu
ture—views that I must respect. Some of these views
of mine, skillfully written, might interest the readers
of the Daily, but I am too near all of them to know
which view to choose.
The hideous situations abroad, however, make this
choice for me. I'd far rather write of my convinced
belief that, despite disappointing exceptions, intelli
gent Stanford youth is naturally wholesome; that. Stan
ford alumni, again despite disappointing exceptions,
will continue generation after generation to furnish
wise and effective leadership in the affairs of this
country and of the world; that the Stanford Faculty,
President and Trustees are here because Stanford stu
dents are here and that they are and must be concerned
primarily with student welfare and with the education
of the student for prepared leadership in human af
fairs; that the School of which I am executive head
is making an extraordinary contribution, and if per
mitted to do so, will continue to make such a contri
bution in the help it gives young men and young
women toward professional educational effectiveness
as scientifically informed, competent leaders in the
field of hygiene and physical education—leaders who
do their own thinking and make their own decisions.

University purposes, however, are all con
cerned with preparation of Stanford youth for the
life of the self-respecting citizen in a free American
democracy, dominated bv the ideals of our Declara
tion of Independence, our Constitution, and our Bill
of Rights, none of which is possible under the govern
ments that now ruthlessly destroy all these precious
democratic ideals. With my compelling belief that
Peace is the only quality of social environment that
can safeguard this world for the life of free people, I
must admit that if such a world is worth living for. it
is worth planning for. working for, sacrificing for. and.
if necessary, worth fighting for. All the great univer
sities of Europe, some of them centuries old. are now
destroyed or reduced to shadows of their past. If we
are to maintain our culture, our civilization and our
standards of government and of life, we at Stanford
must leave nothing undone that can be done to protect
and defend the priceless resources that give us our
freedom. But. we are not united. We are not prepared.
We are not ready.
A FTER 48 years of direct and indirect participation
in the affairs of Stanford, I find it impossible to
decide which of my ''Another Man's Views" would be
a wise choice for a three or four hundred word state
ment in the Stanford Daily. My opportunities for
views of Stanford have been numerous and many of
them "close up." By the end of this coming June, the
Storey family of five will have nine Stanford degrees.
Four of them are degrees of Bachelor of Arts through
which we have looked intimately at undergraduate
Stanford. I have viewed the Alumni Association as a
member for 44 years and observed Stanford as one
of the University staff for a total of 24 years. And per
haps you remember that I noted in the Stanford
broadcast recently that during this period I was given
many opportunities with others to take a participat
ing part in various local, state, national and interna
tional organizations concerned with problems and pro
grams of physical education (including athletics),
school hygiene, social hygiene and college hygiene,
and that the net results of this experience were used
: or the organization and operation of the School of
•vhich I am General Director here at Stanford.
