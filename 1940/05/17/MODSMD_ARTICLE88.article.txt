# Guerard Sees Literature As Cosmopolitan

"Preface to World Literature," by
Albert Guerard, Stanford English
professor; on sale at tbe Rook
store.
Professor Guerard lives up to the
title of his book from its opening
tribute to Goethe, ine ''supreme ex
ponent" of not only German culture
but also of world literature, to its
closing words: . . art is awareness
in creation, criticism is awareness in
contemplation." We only wish we
had hope of fully living up to Pro
fessor Guerard's definition of criti
cism.
The book deals principally with
the fundamental concepts of world
literature. It covers the theory and,
to a certain extent, discusses the
spirit of the fields of literary study.
ERASES BOUNDARIES
It is truly regrettable that more
people cannot take the author's cos
mopolitan attitude toward people,
their motives and their cultures.
Instead of drawing "ooundaries on
the map of cultures, he erases them.
Throughout the book I cannot re
member Dr. Guerard, as is so com
mon in this turbulent world, setting
himself up as the absolute judge 01
another man, his actions, his writ
ings, or his motives. Unfortunately,
even in a university we find men
who are driven to opinionated ex
cesses by their inability to look be
yond their political boundaries.
LANGUAGE NO BARRIER
As a solution to such narrowness,
Dr. Guerard even offers a partial
solution to the problem that lan
uage barriers present, pointing out
how easy it is to acquire a reading
(not necessarily a speaking) knowl
edge of another language, and re
futing the claim thttt translations
leave little of the author in the trans
lated work.
This "Preface to World Litera
ture" is not a "survey" of world lit
erature, but a preface in its true
sense. It clears up many terms and
concepts that are apt to be hazy in
any reader's mind, and prepares the
way for either an initial adventure
or further study in the field, as the
case of the particular reader may be.
tl will give pleasure to the litera
teur as well as the beginner.â€”Adams
