MEXICO CITY, May 16 (UP).â€”
Existence in Mexico of a "fifth col
umn" directed, by Soviet agents and
threatening Mexican institutions,
was charged today by the Workers'
National Anti-Communist bloc.
A manifesto issued by the bloc said
the "fifth column" comprises the
Mexican Communist Party, Commu
nists who have infiltrated into labor
unions, and Spanish refugees who
belonged to the Loyalist militia dur
ing the civil war. The manifesto
said the militia had been reorganized
here and is headed by Vicente Gue
rrero, a Spanish Communist.
