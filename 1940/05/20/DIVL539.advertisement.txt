single advertisement!
The momentous happenings of a troubled world
would slill he yours for the reading. The up-10-the
minule news of your country, your town and your
community would slill he faithfully recorded.

you would he destroyed.
Cereals, meal, bread, fruit and canned foods are

of dispatches from distant wars.
Let the advertisements help you lo live! They list

you can compare the prices and values of the world's
olferings lo you!
