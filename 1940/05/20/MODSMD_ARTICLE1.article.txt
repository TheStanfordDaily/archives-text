### AUDREY STEELE ROSE DOUGLASS 
IS the United States playing Dr.
Jekyll and Mr. Hyde? Politie
ians gild their platforms with cries
of PEACE—yet keymen in govern
ment and business clamor for Amer
ican preparedness for WAR.
While Presidential messages
plead with the dictators to pre
vent the spread of the war in Eu
rope, the U. S. Army high com
mand heckles Congress with prop
ositions to make America "blitz
krieg proof."
Treasury chieftains are mulling
over proposals for fabulous defense
taxes. The War Department wants
ten million dollars to build air-raid
warning stations. Army big-wigs
decree blackouts for radio stations
in case of war. School children are
sending candy money to Washing
ton to held build battleships.
Will the United States carry out
the parallel—will Mr. Hyde shove
Dr. Jekyll off the stage?

A® war fever begins to register in
America, diseased Europe wildly
casts about for panaceas as it reaches
the crisis in the delirium of its fever.
Murmurings from Italy indicate
that II Duce will uphold his axis
partner. Meanwhile Adolf, the nob
at the other end of the axis, masses
the boys in grey-green along the
Norwegian-Swedish frontier ready
to move in at a moment's notice.
In a frantic effort to prevent
the landing of more Allied troops
in Scandinavia, Nazi demands for
landing facilities around Lulea,
Sweden, grow sharper. And the
Swedes arc "thinking it over"
while increasing military prepara
tions.

Ringing in Marshal Petain, "victor
of Verdun," and General Maxim
Wcygand, France's Premier Rey
naud prescribes his antidote. Tak
ing over personal direction of the
French armed forces, Reynaud as
sumes the role of a virtual dictator
with the aged Petain as chief back
er-upper.

Daladier, versatile by request,
does another quick change this time
appearing as Minister of Foreign Af
fairs, giving up the post or war min
ister. His removal cleared the way
for the replacing of Gamelin by
Weygand to generalissimo of the Al
lied armies.

in World War I when Joffre bowed
out to Foch. Apparently the hope
is that Weygand, former right
hand man of Foch, will pull an ace
where Joffre-man Gamelin pulled

Allied hopes are hinged on Wey
gand's ability to keep strumming his
theme song, "L'Attaque, Toujours

bayonet.

Churchill went on the air with a

pep talk.
