# Farm Biologists Control Eye Color in Fruit Flies
## Hormone Experiments Cast Light On Secret of Hereditary Processes 
### 
Stanford biologists Dr. Edward L. Tatum and Professor George W.
Iteadie report that experiments on which they lu«ve been working may
be the means of discovering the secret of hormone control in the processes
of heredity.
After several months' work they have successfully crystalli/.ed one of

the hormones which controls the
development of color in the eye of
the fruit fly. This is the first in
stance of purification of any pig
ment hormone.
Dr. Tatum, working in collabora
tion with Professor Beadle, obtained
the hormone not from flies but pro
duced it by using bactcria feeding
on yeast, sugar, and an acid, trypto
phane. It is still a natural mystery
how a bacillus can synthetically
manufacture a hormone that, in
jected into the larvae of fruit flies,
will color their eyes.
ACCIDENTAL SUCCESS
An accident which turned into a
stroke of luck led to the experiment's
success. About a year ago, Dr. Ta
tum was experimenting with trypto
phane to see if it might affect the
eye-color of fruit flies. One culture,
containing yeast, sugar and trypto
phane became impregnated by acci
dent with an aerobic bacillus.
As a result, Dr. Tatum noticed
that the larvae feeding on that cul
ture developed brown eyes, instead
of the white eyes they normally
have. Subsequent investigation
proved that the bacillus in the pres
ence of tryptophane brought about
the change in eye-color.
ANALYSIS OF HORMONE
The bacillus was found to produce
a substance with hormonal activity.
Further experimentation produced
the hormone artificially through the
use of a number of alcoholic solv
ents.
Light yellow crystals in rosette
formation were obtained by this
means. Analysis by Dr. A. J. Haagen
Smith of the California Institute of
Technology has shown the sub
stance to consist of carbon, nitro
gen, hydrogen, and oxygen.
The close relationship of the bac
terially-produced hormone with the
active hormonal substance of the
insects is practically certain.

be the means of discovering the secret of hormone control in the processes
of heredity.
After several months' work they have successfully crystalli/.ed one of

the hormones which controls the
development of color in the eye of
the fruit fly. This is the first in
stance of purification of any pig
ment hormone.
Dr. Tatum, working in collabora
tion with Professor Beadle, obtained
the hormone not from flies but pro
duced it by using bactcria feeding
on yeast, sugar, and an acid, trypto
phane. It is still a natural mystery
how a bacillus can synthetically
manufacture a hormone that, in
jected into the larvae of fruit flies,
will color their eyes.
ACCIDENTAL SUCCESS
An accident which turned into a
stroke of luck led to the experiment's
success. About a year ago, Dr. Ta
tum was experimenting with trypto
phane to see if it might affect the
eye-color of fruit flies. One culture,
containing yeast, sugar and trypto
phane became impregnated by acci
dent with an aerobic bacillus.
As a result, Dr. Tatum noticed
that the larvae feeding on that cul
ture developed brown eyes, instead
of the white eyes they normally
have. Subsequent investigation
proved that the bacillus in the pres
ence of tryptophane brought about
the change in eye-color.
ANALYSIS OF HORMONE
The bacillus was found to produce
a substance with hormonal activity.
Further experimentation produced
the hormone artificially through the
use of a number of alcoholic solv
ents.
Light yellow crystals in rosette
formation were obtained by this
means. Analysis by Dr. A. J. Haagen
Smith of the California Institute of
Technology has shown the sub
stance to consist of carbon, nitro
gen, hydrogen, and oxygen.
The close relationship of the bac
terially-produced hormone with the
active hormonal substance of the
insects is practically certain.
