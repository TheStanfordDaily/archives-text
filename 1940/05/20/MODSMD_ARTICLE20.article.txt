# Benet Satire Hits Education
## 'Headless Horseman' To Play Wednesday 
### 
Satire by one of America's fore
most poets and strong-arm dealers
in historical whimsy characterizes
the libretto of "The Headless Horse
man," Stanford's first opera, to be
produced Wednesday evening in the
Memorial Theater.
In his straight-faced takeoff on
"Legend of Sleepy Hollow" inci
dents, Stephen Vincent Benet has
taken modern education apart and
fitted the shreds together in a grave,
slap-happy fashion that just about
does for the progressive idea in
child training.
FITTED TO FARM TASTE
And where the author of "John
Brown's Body" and "The Devil and
Daniel Webster" leaves off, F. Cowles
Strickland and Joel Carter take up
the script, adding local allusions and
padding to fit Stanford's taste.
Seven grammar school children
have been borrowed, trained, and
will be utilized Wednesday evening
as atmosphere, when Joel Carter—
Ichabod Crane—sings a patter song
of love and algebra to the leading
lady, Barbara Caswell. The two
boys and seven girls, ranging from
6 to 10 years arrive, duly chaper
oned, in time for the evening re
hearsal of the opera, sing their
pieces, and go home.
ORCHESTRAL BACKGROUND
Musical background for the 40
singers on the stage is provided by
an orchestra enlisted from the San
Francisco Conservatory, the Stan
ford Band, the symphony orchestra,
and people around who just like to
play instruments.
Nicholas Goldschmidt, director of
the opera, and a member of the con
servatory faculty as well as the music
faculty here, has enlisted a bassoon
and an oboe from the city, a flutist
and piccolo player from the band.
The violins, 'cello, double bass,
tympani, drums and woodwinds have
been molded into one unit by Mr.
Goldschmidt from campus musicians.
