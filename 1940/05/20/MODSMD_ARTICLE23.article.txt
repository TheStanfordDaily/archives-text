LONDON, May l!l (UP).—Prime Minister Winston Churchill, admit
ting the situation is grave, declared tonight in a broadcast to the nation
that (ireat Britain and France will wage war until Germany has been de
feated and will "never submit ourselves to servitude and shame."
He said it would "he foolish to lose heart and courage, or suppose" (hat

► the powerful Allied armies could be
brought to their knees in submis
sion within the space of a few weeks
or even months liy Germany.
"I speak to you for the first time
in a solemn hour for the life of our
country, of our own power, of our
allies, and above all, of the cause
of freedom," Churchill said.
BATTLE RAGES
"A tremendous battle is raging in
France and Flanders. The Germans,
by remarkable combination of their
bombing and heavily armored tanks,
have broken through the French
defenses north of the Maginot, Line,
and strong columns of their ar
mored vehicles are ravaging the
open country."
But if the Germans are behind the
Allied front, Churchill told his peo
ple, the French are behind the Ger
man front at many points.
The Prime Minister warned Brit
ons that when the battle in France
abates its force there, a battle will
come "for our island."
"That," Churchill said, "will be
the struggle.
NO HESITATION
"In the supreme emergency we
shall not hesitate to take every step,
even the most drastic, and call
forth from our people the last
ounce and last inch of effort of
which they are capable.
"Relative to the balance of the
British and German air forces, it is
now considerably more favorable to
us than in the beginning of the
battle.
"My confidence in our ability to
fight it out to a finish with the
German air force has been strength
ened by the fierce encounters tak
ing place.
NO DISGUISE
"It would be foolish to disguise
the gravity of the hour," Churchill
asserted. "It would be still more
foolish to lose heart and courage or
suppose that the well-trained and
well-equipped armies numbering
three to four million could be
overcome within the space of a few
weeks or even months by a scoop
or raid of mechanized vehicles
however formidable."
The Prime Minister said that he
had received from the French high
command the "most sacred pledges
that they will fight to the end. Now
one bond unites us all to wage war
until victory is won, and never
submit ourselves to servitude and
shame," Churchill declared.
CHURCHILL CONFERS
Churchill's speech went to the
nation as word came that the Al
lies had changed commanders,
placing General Maxim Wcygand
in charge of the fighting forces.
The Prime Minister told his people
that "if the French army and our
own army are well-handled, as 1
believe they will be, if the French
retain that genius for recovery and
counter-attack for which they so
long have been famous, and if the
British army shows the dogged en
durance and solid fighting power of
which there have been many ex
amples in the past, then a sudden
transformation of the scene might
spring into being."
