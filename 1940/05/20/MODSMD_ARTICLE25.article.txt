# Earthquakes Hit Imperial Valley Cities
## Water Supply Cut; Damage to Property Estimated at Million 
### 
EL CENTRO, May 19 (UP).â€”lm
perial Valley, its towns jolted and
wrecked by a series of severe earth
quakes, counted property damage
in the millions today while water
supplies were rationed and the Red
Cross offered its full resources for
rehabilitation.
Canal headgates at. the Colorado
River, which feeds the rich agricul
tural valley, were closed when it
was learned the main Alamo Canal
had cracked open. Other water
ways, shifted by a twisting quake,
.spilled out uselessly onto open des
ert land.
Mark A. Tomas, Red Cross field
representative, set up temporary
headquarters in the plaza at Braw
ley, where scarcely a building was
not knocked out of line, its roof
caved in or its wall compassed. The
Brawley city council met in the open
and decided only water necessary to
life would be turned on between 5
a.m. and 6 a.m. and again between
<> p.m. and 7 p.m.
RUSH CANAL REPAIRS
A crew of 300 men was rushed to
the Alamo Canal for repairs because
it was feared warm weather would
ruin crops without irrigation. Works
Progress Administration engineers
met with El Centro supervisors to
plan rehabilitation. American Le
gion posts called out their members
for patrol duty.
The Red Cross estimate of dam
age in Brawley alone was $250,000,
although Tomas said the guess was
conservative and was made to guide
early assignment of held to the
valley.
The water situation in Holtville
and Imperial was acute because
storage tanks crashed to the
ground last night and no more was
available after the canals were
emptied. El Centro had enough for
six days and possibly could pump
enough for another four. Calexico
and Mexicali situations were not
known.
10-DAY WATER RESERVE
M. J. Dowd, superintendent and
chief engineer of the irrigation
district which controls the canals,
said tlie Alamo break was on the
Mexican side of the international
border, where a 500-foot section
was opened. A flume also was
damaged.
He estimated that sufficient water
remained in reserve tanks to last a
week to 10 days, providing strict
conservation was practiced.
The Mexican government, also
confronted with a water shortage,
issued emergency orders permitting
American workers and equipment to
be rushed across the international
boundary to start repairs.
Minor temblors continued to shake
the valley today. Telephone and
telegraph communications were
crippled in the quake area.

England and Wales include 58,249
square miles of area.
