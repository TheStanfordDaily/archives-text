# San Jose State Brass Choir Gives Well-rounded Program
## 
### RUTH CAMPBELL 
The Brass Choir of San Jose State
College presented a concert last
night in the Education Auditorium
under the joint sponsorship of the
Division of Music and the Friends
of Music.
Although obviously composed of
amateur musicians, the choir offered
a well-rounded and smoothly exe
cuted program. The nineteen men
and a girl seemed to enjoy working
for their tall, youthful conductor,
and made up in enthusiasm for what
they lacked in technical fluency.
An unusual touch in brasses was
supplied by two fluegelhorns, in
struments widely used In European
orchestral circles, but seldom heard
in America. The conductor, Mau
rice Faulkner, explained that flue
gelhorns strike an intermediate note
between the higher brasses and the
lower French horns.
MODERNS PREDOMINATE
Most outstanding individual per
formances were turned in by Ken
neth Helvey on the cornet and James
Tucker on the French horn.
The program was composed prin
cipally of the works of modern com
posers, and the choir seemed to feel
much more at home with this sort
of music than with the two classical
numbers which they played.
The program consisted of the
"Canzona for Fifteen Brasses" by
Giovanni Gabrieli, "Septet" by Ed
win Gerschefski, "Prelude-Pastorale"
by Phillip Clapp, "Turm-Musik" by
Helmuth Jorns, "Fantasia for Brass
Winds" by Neil Moret Daniels, a
former Stanford student.
TWO BACH WORKS
"Theme and Variations" by James
Tucker, a member of the choir, "Fu
neral March and Canzona" by Henry
Purcell, "Prelude and Caprice" by
Charles Pyle, and "Fanfare" from the
opera "La Peri" by Paul Dukas.
As an encore, the brass choir
played two short works of Bach, a
minuet and a march. These two

compositions were originally writ
ten for the clavichord, and lost some
thing of their original quality by
handling in brass.
Next Sunday the Division of Mu
sic and the Friends of Music will
present the Madrigal Singers of San
Francisco State College, under the
direction of Eileen McCall.

sic and the Friends of Music will
present the Madrigal Singers of San
Francisco State College, under the
direction of Eileen McCall.
The Brass Choir of San Jose State
College presented a concert last
night in the Education Auditorium
under the joint sponsorship of the
Division of Music and the Friends
of Music.
Although obviously composed of
amateur musicians, the choir offered
a well-rounded and smoothly exe
cuted program. The nineteen men
and a girl seemed to enjoy working
for their tall, youthful conductor,
and made up in enthusiasm for what
they lacked in technical fluency.
An unusual touch in brasses was
supplied by two fluegelhorns, in
struments widely used In European
orchestral circles, but seldom heard
in America. The conductor, Mau
rice Faulkner, explained that flue
gelhorns strike an intermediate note
between the higher brasses and the
lower French horns.
MODERNS PREDOMINATE
Most outstanding individual per
formances were turned in by Ken
neth Helvey on the cornet and James
Tucker on the French horn.
The program was composed prin
cipally of the works of modern com
posers, and the choir seemed to feel
much more at home with this sort
of music than with the two classical
numbers which they played.
The program consisted of the
"Canzona for Fifteen Brasses" by
Giovanni Gabrieli, "Septet" by Ed
win Gerschefski, "Prelude-Pastorale"
by Phillip Clapp, "Turm-Musik" by
Helmuth Jorns, "Fantasia for Brass
Winds" by Neil Moret Daniels, a
former Stanford student.
TWO BACH WORKS
"Theme and Variations" by James
Tucker, a member of the choir, "Fu
neral March and Canzona" by Henry
Purcell, "Prelude and Caprice" by
Charles Pyle, and "Fanfare" from the
opera "La Peri" by Paul Dukas.
As an encore, the brass choir
played two short works of Bach, a
minuet and a march. These two

compositions were originally writ
ten for the clavichord, and lost some
thing of their original quality by
handling in brass.
Next Sunday the Division of Mu
