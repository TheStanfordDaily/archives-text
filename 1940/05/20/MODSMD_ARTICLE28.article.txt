# Knoles to Discuss Jefferson on Air
## 
### 
Dr. George H. Knoles, instructor j
in history, will be the next speaker j
on the regular Stanford program
over KPO at 9:15 o'clock, Wednes
day evening. The Jeffersonian tra
dition in American politics will be
the subject of his talk.
Since leaders of both major po
litical parties have claimed recently !
that their ideas and ideals of gov
ernment represent those set forth
by Thomas Jefferson more than a
century ago, a re-examination of
Jefferson's principles of government
will aid in an understanding of how
both Republicans and Democrats
are able to draw inspiration from
his life, according to Dr. Knoles.
