### MARGE HOVEY 
Stanford's two-mile relay team broke the national collegiate record
;(4;iiii last Eriday night at the Einnish Relief meet in Eos Angeles Coliseum.
I liis gives the officials their choice between the 7:3K.X this week-end and
tiie 7:!>7.7 race in the Cal-Stanford Relays.
This confusion has arisen because official red tape has delayed recog
nition of the earlier record. But either wav Stanford holds the record.

Burman Serable, out of the race
because of a pulled Achilles tendon,
was replaced by Ernie Clark. Ten
minutes later Clark returned to run
his quarter of the mile relay, and
Ihe first race showed its effect on
him. Charlie Shaw, Craig William
son, and Les Johnson, who was re
placing Captain Clyde Jeffrey, gave
the race all they had to come in sec
ond to Cal. The winning time was
3:12.9.
FINN DRAWING CARI)
Next to the two-mile run featur
ing Taisto Maki, the Flying Finn, the
battle between Paul Moore and
Louie Zamperini in the anchor lap
of the two-mile relay was a big
drawing card of the meet. Starting
four or five yards behind Troy's
Zamp, Moore ran a slow 1:53 lap to
beat the Trojan by two yards.
Coach Bill Ellington reported that
the cavalcade of movie stars and
other big names delayed the races
over an hour, causing the runners
to warm up three limes in hopes
that the event was finally starting.
BERKELEY MEET
Three Stanford men entered the
Pacific Association meet over in Ber
keley Saturday afternoon, competing
unattached for practice. Bob Ken
yon tied for fourth place in the pole
vault, while Jim Lincoln tied for
third in the high jump with a poor
effort of G feet 1 inch. Frank Kern
took a third in the broad jump with
22 feet l inches.
Coach Ellington reported last night
that Clyde Jeffrey will return to
practice today in preparation for the
Pacific Coast Conference meet this
Saturday in Los Angeles. Jeff was
inspected by "Old Bill" yesterday
and reported fit for service.
ANDERSEN BACK
Staii Andersen, who has had a
pulled back muscle, will also see
action. At the end of last week he
was putting the shot around 51 and
52 feet and Ellington said he ex
pects Stan to take first in the discus
and shot this Saturday.
One record may be broken, ac
cording to the coach, when Paul
Moore, Zamperini, Leroy and
Liebowitz of Idaho meet Vn the mile
run.
"If Paul is pushed, and it looks as
if he will be, he can set a new world's
record," Ellington predicted.
