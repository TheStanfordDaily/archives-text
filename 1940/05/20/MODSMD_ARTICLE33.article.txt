# Mize Aids Cards In Giant Victory
## 
### 
NEW YORK. May 10 (UP). â€”For
four seasons, major league pitchers
have worked to find a weakness in
the batting armor of Johnny Mize
and if current records are any indi
cation, their job has only started.
The G-foot-2-inch St. Louis Cardi
nal first baseman has basked in the
shadow of teammate Joe Medwick
since his debut in 19.')G but this year
he is one reason why the Cardinals
cannot be counted out of the Na
tional League race.
Mize blasted out his 121 h homer
ol the season today to help the Card
inals defeat, the New York Giants,
6-5. Rookie Joe Orengo's homer tied
the score for the Cards and his single
won the game in the 10th inning but
Mize's homer was his third in two
days nnd gave him a wide margin in
the major league home run mara
thon. Mize has 12 four-baggers,
while runner-up Jimmy Foxx of the
lioston Red Sox has nine.
