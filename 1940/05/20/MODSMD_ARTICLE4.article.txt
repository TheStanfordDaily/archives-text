### 
"The Three Sisters" by Anton
Chekhov will wind up this year's
presentation by the Speech and
Drama Division. Tho play will be
presented in the Little Theater for
three nights, May 28, 29, and 31.
Chekhov, who is known as the
great naturalist, was the leader in
the shift into modern drama. He be
gan by writing of life as he saw it.
His first fame in Russia came with
his writing of comic shorts, such as
appear in the New Yorker today.
He wrote only four plays, of which
"The Cherry Orchard" has proven
a world favorite.
PLOTS LIFE-LIKE
Chekhov's aim in his plays ap
pears to have been to make people
see stories in the lives of everyday
people. He took a story as it hap
pened; he saw a plot in life as it is.
He wanted to give the world a true
character sketch of people and how
they live.
"The Three Sisters" is no excep
tion to this aim, according to
F. Cowlcs Strickland, director of the
play. Here Chekhov writes the
story of three girls who dream of
what they want to do with their
lives, as so many girls do, but who
never get the chance to fulfill those
dreams. Here Chevok parallels real
life in his play and paints a picture
of what generally happens to most
dreamers.
STORY OF PLAY
The three sisters, Olga, Masha,
and Irena, live in a small provincial
city in Russia, but they all want to
go to Moscow. They are prevented
from going and the plot unfolds
with the arrival of a regiment. Two
of the sisters fall in love with sol
diers, but one sister is already mar
! ried and the other's sweetheart is
| killed in a duel. The story of the
i third sister shows her gradually
| turning into an old maid, and pic
i tures her reaction to this fact.
