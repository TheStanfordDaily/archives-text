### MARGE HOVEY 
THE BEST
TRACK TEAMS
It is becoming accepted that the
Pacific Coast, especially U.S.C.,
dominates the national track field,
but it took the Fresno Relays to
show how strong Stanford is in
comparison to the rest of the coun
try.
At the West Coast Relays in
Ircsno last week-end. the Indians
and Trojans took 12 of the 13
events. In seven of these, the
marks were better than the ones
scored by all the combined ath
letes at the Pcnn. Drake. Kansas,
and Texas relays. And five of
these seven events were taken by
Stanford.
Captain Clyde Jeffrey took the in
dividual honors with his 9.5 hun
dred and two fast anchor laps in
sprint relays. If he hadn't pulled a
muscle he'd have run a fourth race.
Mozel Ellerbe, his closest rival, ran
9.8 races at the Penn relays. The
Indian quarter-mile quartet was
three-tenths of a second faster than
the Oklahoma team at the Texas
relays.
The Stanford half-mile was
seven-tenths of a second faster
than the Texas team that won at
Drake in 1:2(>.7. the best time un
til the Indians ran. In the mile
relay the Farm boys were two
seconds ahead of Michigan at
Drake and one second faster than
Maryland at Pcnn in the two-mile
baton exchange.
Since the Fresno meet the two
mile relay men have again bet
tered the national collegiate rec
ord. doing 7:38.3. Their first rec
ord breaking race of 7:37.7 has not
been recognized yet but it is ex
pected to be.
U.S.C. was right behind the east
erners with Johnny Wilson's 6-ft.-6
high jump and Kenny Dill's pole
vault of 14 It. 2 in. And it was an
off night for Johnny. Now that Bob
Peoples is out of the javelin, Hugo
DeGroot of S.C. and Bob Stone of
Stanford will be the West's candi
dates, not to mention Boyd Brown
of Oregon. And you can't forget
Stan Andersen in the shot and
discus.
Now comes word from up north
that Washington State won the
northern division of the P.C.C. and
will challenge southern suprem
acy in several events. Liebowitz of
Idaho ran the mile in 4:12.2, while
Lee Orr of W.S.C. came through
with a 47.3 quarter. His furlong of
21.3 will at least make him com
petition for Jeffrey.
Dixie Garner of W.S.C. has been

considered the best distance man in
Lhe Northwest. After being de
feated by Liebowitz in the mile,
he came back with a 9:24.5 two-mile
race. Boyd Brown's javelin toss of
223 feet should give him a first in
just about any meet now that
Peoples is out.
And all these outstanding
tracksters will be competing this
Saturday in the Los Angeles Coli
seum for the Pacific Coast Confer
ence meet. If Captain Jell' is back
in form, as is expected. Stanford
should take this meet for their
sccend w in over U.S.C.

tiiis meet down south brings up
again the matter of "slow-clocking"
of northern speedsters. It is claimed
by a man who should know, and
does, that Jeffrey ran two 9.3 hun
dreds last season, in the U.C.L.A.
meet and the Long Beach relays. In
the Bruin meet he was credited with
10 flat and with 9.8 in the other
race.
This is done by setting the clocks
before the race is run, so says our
informant. But you would think
these southern officials would
realize that slow-clocking of Jeffrey
makes their sprinters look pretty
sick, when they place second and
third in a 10-second century. May
be the timers will get the idea by
this Saturday.

sccend w in over U.S.C.

tiiis meet down south brings up
again the matter of "slow-clocking"
of northern speedsters. It is claimed
by a man who should know, and
does, that Jeffrey ran two 9.3 hun
dreds last season, in the U.C.L.A.
meet and the Long Beach relays. In
the Bruin meet he was credited with
10 flat and with 9.8 in the other
race.
This is done by setting the clocks
before the race is run, so says our
informant. But you would think
these southern officials would
realize that slow-clocking of Jeffrey
makes their sprinters look pretty
sick, when they place second and
third in a 10-second century. May
be the timers will get the idea by
this Saturday.
THE BEST
TRACK TEAMS
It is becoming accepted that the
Pacific Coast, especially U.S.C.,
dominates the national track field,
but it took the Fresno Relays to
show how strong Stanford is in
comparison to the rest of the coun
try.
At the West Coast Relays in
Ircsno last week-end. the Indians
and Trojans took 12 of the 13
events. In seven of these, the
marks were better than the ones
scored by all the combined ath
letes at the Pcnn. Drake. Kansas,
and Texas relays. And five of
these seven events were taken by
Stanford.
Captain Clyde Jeffrey took the in
dividual honors with his 9.5 hun
dred and two fast anchor laps in
sprint relays. If he hadn't pulled a
muscle he'd have run a fourth race.
Mozel Ellerbe, his closest rival, ran
9.8 races at the Penn relays. The
Indian quarter-mile quartet was
three-tenths of a second faster than
the Oklahoma team at the Texas
relays.
The Stanford half-mile was
seven-tenths of a second faster
than the Texas team that won at
Drake in 1:2(>.7. the best time un
til the Indians ran. In the mile
relay the Farm boys were two
seconds ahead of Michigan at
Drake and one second faster than
Maryland at Pcnn in the two-mile
baton exchange.
Since the Fresno meet the two
mile relay men have again bet
tered the national collegiate rec
ord. doing 7:38.3. Their first rec
ord breaking race of 7:37.7 has not
been recognized yet but it is ex
pected to be.
U.S.C. was right behind the east
erners with Johnny Wilson's 6-ft.-6
high jump and Kenny Dill's pole
vault of 14 It. 2 in. And it was an
off night for Johnny. Now that Bob
Peoples is out of the javelin, Hugo
DeGroot of S.C. and Bob Stone of
Stanford will be the West's candi
dates, not to mention Boyd Brown
of Oregon. And you can't forget
Stan Andersen in the shot and
discus.
Now comes word from up north
that Washington State won the
northern division of the P.C.C. and
will challenge southern suprem
acy in several events. Liebowitz of
Idaho ran the mile in 4:12.2, while
Lee Orr of W.S.C. came through
with a 47.3 quarter. His furlong of
21.3 will at least make him com
petition for Jeffrey.
Dixie Garner of W.S.C. has been

considered the best distance man in
Lhe Northwest. After being de
feated by Liebowitz in the mile,
he came back with a 9:24.5 two-mile
race. Boyd Brown's javelin toss of
223 feet should give him a first in
just about any meet now that
Peoples is out.
And all these outstanding
tracksters will be competing this
Saturday in the Los Angeles Coli
seum for the Pacific Coast Confer
ence meet. If Captain Jell' is back
in form, as is expected. Stanford
should take this meet for their

Lee Orr of W.S.C. came through
with a 47.3 quarter. His furlong of
21.3 will at least make him com
petition for Jeffrey.
Dixie Garner of W.S.C. has been

considered the best distance man in
Lhe Northwest. After being de
feated by Liebowitz in the mile,
he came back with a 9:24.5 two-mile
race. Boyd Brown's javelin toss of
223 feet should give him a first in
just about any meet now that
Peoples is out.
And all these outstanding
tracksters will be competing this
Saturday in the Los Angeles Coli
seum for the Pacific Coast Confer
ence meet. If Captain Jell' is back
in form, as is expected. Stanford
should take this meet for their
sccend w in over U.S.C.

tiiis meet down south brings up
again the matter of "slow-clocking"
of northern speedsters. It is claimed
by a man who should know, and
does, that Jeffrey ran two 9.3 hun
dreds last season, in the U.C.L.A.
meet and the Long Beach relays. In
the Bruin meet he was credited with
10 flat and with 9.8 in the other
race.
This is done by setting the clocks
before the race is run, so says our
informant. But you would think
these southern officials would
realize that slow-clocking of Jeffrey
makes their sprinters look pretty
sick, when they place second and
third in a 10-second century. May
be the timers will get the idea by
this Saturday.
THE BEST
TRACK TEAMS
It is becoming accepted that the
Pacific Coast, especially U.S.C.,
dominates the national track field,
but it took the Fresno Relays to
show how strong Stanford is in
comparison to the rest of the coun
try.
At the West Coast Relays in
Ircsno last week-end. the Indians
and Trojans took 12 of the 13
events. In seven of these, the
marks were better than the ones
scored by all the combined ath
letes at the Pcnn. Drake. Kansas,
and Texas relays. And five of
these seven events were taken by
Stanford.
Captain Clyde Jeffrey took the in
dividual honors with his 9.5 hun
dred and two fast anchor laps in
sprint relays. If he hadn't pulled a
muscle he'd have run a fourth race.
Mozel Ellerbe, his closest rival, ran
9.8 races at the Penn relays. The
Indian quarter-mile quartet was
three-tenths of a second faster than
the Oklahoma team at the Texas
relays.
The Stanford half-mile was
seven-tenths of a second faster
than the Texas team that won at
Drake in 1:2(>.7. the best time un
til the Indians ran. In the mile
relay the Farm boys were two
seconds ahead of Michigan at
Drake and one second faster than
Maryland at Pcnn in the two-mile
baton exchange.
Since the Fresno meet the two
mile relay men have again bet
tered the national collegiate rec
ord. doing 7:38.3. Their first rec
ord breaking race of 7:37.7 has not
been recognized yet but it is ex
pected to be.
U.S.C. was right behind the east
erners with Johnny Wilson's 6-ft.-6
high jump and Kenny Dill's pole
vault of 14 It. 2 in. And it was an
off night for Johnny. Now that Bob
Peoples is out of the javelin, Hugo
DeGroot of S.C. and Bob Stone of
Stanford will be the West's candi
dates, not to mention Boyd Brown
of Oregon. And you can't forget
Stan Andersen in the shot and
discus.
Now comes word from up north
that Washington State won the
northern division of the P.C.C. and
will challenge southern suprem
acy in several events. Liebowitz of
Idaho ran the mile in 4:12.2, while
Lee Orr of W.S.C. came through
with a 47.3 quarter. His furlong of
21.3 will at least make him com
petition for Jeffrey.
Dixie Garner of W.S.C. has been

considered the best distance man in
