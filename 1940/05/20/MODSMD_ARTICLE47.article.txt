A(il lN I I'IMS MORI M is no spun-siigar frosting lo
* * disguise Stanford politico* tasteless Leadership
Institute. It wouldn't even take a cynical senior
to spread the "It's dry as dust underneath"' propa
ganda. li s just not the same forum which discussed
committee co-ordination et al. last year and the year
before that, and the other years.

Popular rejection caused the semi-idealists lo
drop ihc address on the theory and purpose of stu
dent government which formerly opened the annual
Leadership Institute. And as for the closing con
ference. all agree that there is no reason for the old
president of Interfraternity Council to go to the
Women's Clubhouse to tell the new president how
it is with Interfraternity Council on the same night
llie editor of The Daily g'Â»es to the Women's Club
house to tell the new editor what campaigns not to
launch.
If integration were a goal of that old program,
committeemen lost sight of ihe goal; and if students
were interested in the meetings, seniors used it as an
excuse to cool them down lo the proper temperature
for entering the proverbial cold, cold world.
According to Ihe plan of the Activities Forum,
Ihe problems which this year's oflicers encountered
are next year's officers lo solve. And next Wednes
day's meeting is designed to let them hull-session it
out together.
I he Forum is thus designed for the new oflicers
and they have only themselves upon whom to en
force the decisions which may evolve. And those
uho do not attend have only themselves to blame for
failing to make their own conclusions, and having
lo abide by those of the more conscientious breth
ren.
I his is all so much possibility. So is the Activities
I'nrum; so are next year's officers; and so is next
year.
II II take about two hours' worth of next week to
make the most of so much possibility.
