# How About It?

### 
A I' I" IKMA'I lON of Ex Committee's tentative deci
sion to telescope some of the spring quarter ac
ta ities. perhaps the combination of the Convalescent
Home Drive with llack to the Farm, was seen the
past week-end in the half-filled houses to which the
Ham s Head musical murder mystery played.

I'ilty or sixlv people had been practically con
ducting their curricular activities from the Memorial
I heater as they worked to turn out "I m a Stranglcr
11. »re Myself" for a campus accustomed to Spring
Slums. I nfortimalely the audience barely outnum-

Obviously il was a case of "too much going on";
obviously campus support had been wrung dry by
I lie County I'air. relief drives, and Home Week suc
cession. Moreover, there was a lovely moon, not to
mention a number of house dances.

Now comes Wednesday, when another campus
show will take the boards of Memorial Theater.
'I lie Division of Music with the assistance of the
Speech and Drama will stage something new in
I'arm dramatics- a one-ad opera, ''The Headless
Horseman In Stephen Vincent Ocnet and Douglass
Moore.

I here are two reasons why this production should
gel campus support. The lirsl is that this is the first
opera ever presented here with student voices. The
work is considered good music by people who know,
and the stor\ is American folklore, "The Legend of
Sleepy Hollow."

I he second reason for support is that the drama
department has 11« >( presented a poor show this year.
I he high level of entertainment that it has main
tained deserves a <:ood representation for its ven
ture into a new field.

I his is the golden opportunity for the Farm to
prove its reputation as a campus which enjoys "the
cultural thing, and spend an entertaining evening
lor something less than the cost of a symphony or
opera in the < il\. Moreover, campus calendars arc
light this week, and the performance will lake only
an hour and a half of anvhod) s Wednesday eve
ning.—M. E. F.
