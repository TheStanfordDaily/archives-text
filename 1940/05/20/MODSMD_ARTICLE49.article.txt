'JPHE EDITOR, SIR:
What a week! A week which saw the slaughter
of the flower of the Dutch army, and which heard the
widely acclaimed message of the President of the
United States, calling for an appropriation to fill the
heavens with the world's greatest armada. In all these
breath-taking world events, the subject of this letter
is trivial—the destruction of a few hundred swallow
fledglings at Stanford. Their removal was necessary
for many reasons:
1. They were dirty. Though as I watched them, and
saw tiny heads peer out from their substantial homes,
I thought they were marvelous architects and tidy
home keepers.
2. They were noisy. In this machine age, who wants
to be disturbed by avian controversy, or even by the
excited chirpings of fledglings at feeding time?
3. They were useless. Without noxious sprays, we
require no aid from swallows to free us of our pests.
4. There would be no place for them in that day
when 50,000 aeroplanes will hover over us.
And yet, as I watched the distraught home build
ers today wheeling to and from the sites of their former
homes, disconsolate for their young, I felt that Stan

ford hud lost something it could riot replace. Fool
ishly my mind turned to ravished Holland—a silly
association, to be sure.
Sincerely,
A Farm Bov
