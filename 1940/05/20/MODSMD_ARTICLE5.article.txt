### 
Stanford women with an interest
in fashion designing will be aided
next year in the search of a market
for their designs by a student rep
resentative of the Campus Originals
Guild. This representative is to be
one of fifty college women, of the
class of 1941, to be chosen soon by
the Guild from colleges the country
over, to serve as a salaried reporter
of fashion trends on the campus.
