# WHERE DO WE WANT OUR DICTATORS?

r EDITOR, SIR:
Crusaders, as all fanatics, are busy people. Al
ready some of them are itching to have Americans
march off to war, for Hitler has become an obsession
with them. No cost is too great to defeat him and
usher in a world to their liking.
That our bravest and finest men will perish and
future generations will descend from inferior stock
leaves them unmoved. Hitler must go. That war will
saddle America with an onerous debt leaves them
cold, for they expect to buy a free world for free men.
But history takes no notice of expectations. After
the crusaders have shot their arrow of longing to
the other shore, who can say what they will find in
America on their return? A free America, they blandly
assume, but forget not that democracy is a luxury.
Forget not that people of many countries made poor
and desperate by oppressive taxes of the last war de
cided they couldn't afTord the luxury. They turned
to the promises of the man on horseback.
Ironically the war to make the world safe for
democracy drove democracy from most of Europe.
Might not another war drive democracy from America
too? Let's take stock of America. Our cities and states
are operating on borrowed capital; the national debt
limit has been reached. Add to this alarming fiscal
picture a new hundred billion dollar war debt and the
rout of democracy from Ameriac will be inescap
able. . . .
God grant that we let Europe tend to her own
madmen! A dictator in America is too high a cost
for driving a dictator from Europe.
