# BULL SESSION
## WHY DISAGREE? 
### JAN GOULD 
r |" , HE other generation has come out of its neutrality
fidgets, being less idealistic than college students,
and has begun considering just what the kids are say
ing about their own part in the war. They listened and
agreed at first that college students would be damned
fools if they let themselves get sucked into fighting
in Europe for a current catchword. Then they got be
fogged at the strenuous tack the young men's objec
tions took; then they were bored, rather, and then
they were embarrassed.

If the comments of several pretty stable characters
who saw the other war through mean anything, the
generation ahead of us is beginning to think that its
sons and daughters are hysterical from too many hor
ror stories, from an overdose of the likes of Ken maga
zine. There's a terrific overemphasis, they feel, on the
revulsion against being drawn and dismembered on a
battlefield. What difference does it make—everyone
dies. Basket cases are fairly rare and shellshock is a
neurasthenia; a great many men come back. Are these
young fanatics neurotic, or cowardly, or what?

The men know the answei', but they can't go
around explaining themselves, clutching lapels and
forcing other people to give them credit for not ra
tionalizing. But because there is no sex distinction in
this attitude toward war, the women can talk about it
to other people without loss of dignity or being mis
interpreted.

the older generation mourns the destroying
of cultures and intelligence, decency, spiritual
stability, and even tangible things, the young ones
mourn the destroying of themselves, the unutterable
badness of having their bodies blown away —and they're
talking about the same thing. The only way they can
express their horror—or their grief—over what war
does is to tell it in terms of their own knowledge.

Philosophy might call the difference, and the in
articulate way we express our ideas, the discrepancy
between two universes of discourse. We don't know
much about civilizations, or ideas. We don't think in
terms of beauty 01* truth or abstract goodness.

The horror of war as a concept is beyond our
knowing, now, in any way beyond the way of our
personal destruction; but we're feeling the same thing
with the same spiritual significances that the other
people do.
I think this is what we mean.

sons and daughters are hysterical from too many hor
ror stories, from an overdose of the likes of Ken maga
zine. There's a terrific overemphasis, they feel, on the
revulsion against being drawn and dismembered on a
battlefield. What difference does it make—everyone
dies. Basket cases are fairly rare and shellshock is a
neurasthenia; a great many men come back. Are these
young fanatics neurotic, or cowardly, or what?

The men know the answei', but they can't go
around explaining themselves, clutching lapels and
forcing other people to give them credit for not ra
tionalizing. But because there is no sex distinction in
this attitude toward war, the women can talk about it
to other people without loss of dignity or being mis
interpreted.

the older generation mourns the destroying
of cultures and intelligence, decency, spiritual
stability, and even tangible things, the young ones
mourn the destroying of themselves, the unutterable
badness of having their bodies blown away —and they're
talking about the same thing. The only way they can
express their horror—or their grief—over what war
does is to tell it in terms of their own knowledge.

Philosophy might call the difference, and the in
articulate way we express our ideas, the discrepancy
between two universes of discourse. We don't know
much about civilizations, or ideas. We don't think in
terms of beauty 01* truth or abstract goodness.

The horror of war as a concept is beyond our
knowing, now, in any way beyond the way of our
personal destruction; but we're feeling the same thing
with the same spiritual significances that the other
people do.
I think this is what we mean.
r |" , HE other generation has come out of its neutrality
fidgets, being less idealistic than college students,
and has begun considering just what the kids are say
ing about their own part in the war. They listened and
agreed at first that college students would be damned
fools if they let themselves get sucked into fighting
in Europe for a current catchword. Then they got be
fogged at the strenuous tack the young men's objec
tions took; then they were bored, rather, and then
they were embarrassed.

If the comments of several pretty stable characters
who saw the other war through mean anything, the
generation ahead of us is beginning to think that its
