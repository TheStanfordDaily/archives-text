# Another Man's View
## FUTURE GOLD STAR MOTHERS, ATTENTION! 
### BOB LIVINGSTON 
President of the Senior Class
about the European conflict has become a
very ticklish enterprise both because there is so
dynamic a public opinion, and because tanks appar
ently roll faster than presses. However, if we set our
sights in front or behind a score of years, we can
approach problems without the tension of the moment.
It's much easier to decide now whether we would have
volunteered for fighting in 1914 than it is to decide
what our course should be this year.
The freedom and democracy that we fought for in
the last war has been ours for 21 years. But has it
been a freedom and democracy for those who lost the
war? Hitler's succession to a liberal German chancel
lery may be laid to a desire of Germans to revise the
terms of the Treaty of Versailles united with a fear
of economic radicalism. If Allied leaders had been
sympathetic to the pleadings of Bruening and thereby
obviated the forces which brought Hitler into power,
how different would have been the story? Britain
and France now have facing them a much greater eco
nomic and physical problem than any amount of con
cession would have presented. Today, largely because
of shortsightedness, English, French, and German pa
triotism is demanding that young men premeditate
murder among whole populations.
Those leaders German and Allied, were not dead
wrong nor were thev dead right. But the men who
served them are dead, right or wrong. It therefore be
hooves us to consider seriously how we can assure
ourselves against the future loss of democracy by
force or failure.

r 21-year pause cost us 37,000,000 lives and many
billion dollars. Would we have done better to have
thrown half that weight toward the establishment of
an international police force backed by an interna
tional court? After the war might we have made more
success of the League of Nations? If so then, why not
strive in that direction now? Or are we to be satisfied
with an International Postal Service?
What amount of sacrifice would we have to make
to institute an International Federation? Would it cost
much more in lives and money than war? Would it
give us greater or less security than we obtain by
war? Perhaps you ask how we could compete with
coolie labor if we would have to lower our standard
of living in order to raise that of the Australian ab
origine. As it happens we are able to maintain a
substantial difference between ourselves and share
croppers, and Melbourne Englishmen manage to keep
the larder full without resorting to the boomerang.
The Phantom, Superman, Dick Tracy, and Lud
Gluskin are all testimony to any doubters that the
impossible can he done.

r 21-year pause cost us 37,000,000 lives and many
billion dollars. Would we have done better to have
thrown half that weight toward the establishment of
an international police force backed by an interna
tional court? After the war might we have made more
success of the League of Nations? If so then, why not
strive in that direction now? Or are we to be satisfied
with an International Postal Service?
What amount of sacrifice would we have to make
to institute an International Federation? Would it cost
much more in lives and money than war? Would it
give us greater or less security than we obtain by
war? Perhaps you ask how we could compete with
coolie labor if we would have to lower our standard
of living in order to raise that of the Australian ab
origine. As it happens we are able to maintain a
substantial difference between ourselves and share
croppers, and Melbourne Englishmen manage to keep
the larder full without resorting to the boomerang.

about the European conflict has become a
very ticklish enterprise both because there is so
dynamic a public opinion, and because tanks appar

sights in front or behind a score of years, we can
approach problems without the tension of the moment.
It's much easier to decide now whether we would have
volunteered for fighting in 1914 than it is to decide
what our course should be this year.
The freedom and democracy that we fought for in
the last war has been ours for 21 years. But has it
been a freedom and democracy for those who lost the
war? Hitler's succession to a liberal German chancel
lery may be laid to a desire of Germans to revise the
terms of the Treaty of Versailles united with a fear
of economic radicalism. If Allied leaders had been
sympathetic to the pleadings of Bruening and thereby
obviated the forces which brought Hitler into power,
how different would have been the story? Britain
and France now have facing them a much greater eco
nomic and physical problem than any amount of con
cession would have presented. Today, largely because
of shortsightedness, English, French, and German pa

murder among whole populations.
