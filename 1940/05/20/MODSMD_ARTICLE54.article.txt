# 'Doctor Takes A Wife' Is Looney But Plausible
## 
### 
"Doctor Takes a Wife," now playing
at the Fox Stanford.
With a "just married" sign on the
car, a handful of rice on the rug, and
Ray Milland in the bed, it was pretty
hard for Loretta Young to prove
that they weren't married. And
worse if she did.
That, in preview length, is "The
Doctor Takes a Wife."
Unlike many of Hollywood's loon
ey comedies, this one seems plaus
ible; the audience suffers no im
pulse to just explain everything all
around and then leave.

From the shots of desperate Dr.
Timothy Sterling trying to serve
cocktails to a wife and a horde of
psychologists in one apartment and
to a suspicious fiancee in the adjoin
ing one until the episode of a couple
of football players working "the good
old XYZ play" on the villain, the
scenes are really funny.

A great deal of the credit goes to
the minor characters. Particularly
good are the above-mentioned ath
letes and the university dean who
had but to clear his throat for every
one in the room to snap to attention.
Reginald Gardiner was a particularly
despicable snake—the more credit to
him.

Milland as Dr. Timothy Sterling,
a serious and stubborn psychologist,
turns in a smooth and sophisticated
performance. Loretta Young as the
authoress of "Spinsters Ai-en't Spin
ach" is even better.
Particularly effective is the scene

in which Dr. Sterling sends her to
a neighbor for help, while she mur
murs "What's the matter with me?"
and backs the car up.
The one unanswerable question is
how an apparently intelligent young
doctor ever acquired a fiancee who
continually addressed -him as "cook
ie." Of course he walked out on her
in the last reel and wrote Loretta's
name on the special marriage li
cense.
The main feature was followed by
a thing called "The Dark Com
mand"—beautiful girl, slow-speak
ing, gun-toting hero, mustached vil
lain, midwestern town, and the
thundering hooves of horses. You
get the idea.—Richmond
