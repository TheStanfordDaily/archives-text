# 'Strangler' Gets Campus Laughs
## Cefaratti, Muheim Take Acting Honors 
### JEAN NOWELL 
That there was much to be criti
cized in "I'm a Strangle!' Here My
self," is pretty well agreed upon by
the campus at large. However, those
who did not have a good time during
most of the evening are in the mi
nority. Consensus seems to be that,
as a work of art in the humor field,
it just wasn't; as a funny show, it
was swell.

If the proceedings could have been
reversed, with the first act coming
second and the second act coijiing
first, it is probable that opinion
would have been overwhelmingly
favorable. The second act, especially
the last scene, could not compare
with the first in tempo, comedy, and
general caliber, and, unfortunately,
that second act sticks in your mind,
canceling out, to some extent, your
emotions about the first.

Ram's Head dependables, for the
most part, walked off with top act
ing honors. Tony Cefaratti's Bronx
accented Chief Dugan and Harry
Muheim's Three - Star Hennessey
were both excellent, and their scenes
together were the best acted in the
show. However, the black-out was
too long.
George B. Steele, otherwise John
Lawry, played his first scene with
malicious verve; how he stood the
beating he took in Scene 111 with
out moving a muscle is difficult to
understand, but admirable. Nancy
Behlke, as his widow, had a tendency
to come down too hard on her lines,
but her technique was good for the
character she was portraying.
STUDENT STAND-OUTS
Among the college kids, harried
house-mouse Dana Winters, dumb
athlete Aubrey Austin, and obnox
ious Ash Wilson were outstanding.
Brad Young, hitherto a singer, made
the shift to singing actor easily.
Pat Bernard sang well, as she al
ways has; and she's pretty too.
Best song in the show was "Theme
and Variations on a Body." This
man Verdi turns out pretty good
tunes. Ram's Head was lucky to
discover him. However, the ramifi
cations of the thing are a little ter
rifying, if you count up all the boys
who are just as available and just
as dead. Next year's Spring Show
by Muheim, Zelver, and Wagner fea
turing the Kappa Alpha bathtub.
Among the ballads, "You Took Me
by Storm" and "When I Looked at
You" seemed the most likely to suc
ceed, and very effective were Bob
Stevens' legs as an added fillip to
his song. "As We Go Marching to
Steele's House," sung to a tune that
really riles a girl-friend of mine
from Atlanta, was the best presented
of the lot.
Orchestrally speaking you couldn't
have asked for more. Ex-Ram's Head
member Art McCue gave a polish to
Hal Moreno's already smooth ar
rangements that made some of the
songs sound better than they were.
Sets were unequivocally fine.
Dance Director Mary Jean Haynes'
jitterbug number was fast and swell
to watch, but something, I'm not
sure just what, should have been
done about the encore. It wasn't
any fun at all to watch the strained
exhaustion on the dancers' faces as
they grimly did It again.
"Strangler" was Charlie Bulotti's
last Ram's Head job at Stanford,
and, from his standpoint (that of
director), it couldn't have been
better.

Ram's Head dependables, for the
most part, walked off with top act
ing honors. Tony Cefaratti's Bronx
accented Chief Dugan and Harry
Muheim's Three - Star Hennessey
were both excellent, and their scenes
together were the best acted in the
show. However, the black-out was
too long.
George B. Steele, otherwise John
Lawry, played his first scene with
malicious verve; how he stood the
beating he took in Scene 111 with
out moving a muscle is difficult to
understand, but admirable. Nancy
Behlke, as his widow, had a tendency
to come down too hard on her lines,
but her technique was good for the
character she was portraying.
STUDENT STAND-OUTS
Among the college kids, harried
house-mouse Dana Winters, dumb
athlete Aubrey Austin, and obnox
ious Ash Wilson were outstanding.
Brad Young, hitherto a singer, made
the shift to singing actor easily.
Pat Bernard sang well, as she al
ways has; and she's pretty too.
Best song in the show was "Theme
and Variations on a Body." This
man Verdi turns out pretty good
tunes. Ram's Head was lucky to
discover him. However, the ramifi
cations of the thing are a little ter
rifying, if you count up all the boys
who are just as available and just
as dead. Next year's Spring Show
by Muheim, Zelver, and Wagner fea
turing the Kappa Alpha bathtub.
Among the ballads, "You Took Me
by Storm" and "When I Looked at
You" seemed the most likely to suc
ceed, and very effective were Bob
Stevens' legs as an added fillip to
his song. "As We Go Marching to
Steele's House," sung to a tune that
really riles a girl-friend of mine
from Atlanta, was the best presented
of the lot.
Orchestrally speaking you couldn't
have asked for more. Ex-Ram's Head
member Art McCue gave a polish to
Hal Moreno's already smooth ar
rangements that made some of the
songs sound better than they were.
Sets were unequivocally fine.
Dance Director Mary Jean Haynes'
jitterbug number was fast and swell
to watch, but something, I'm not
sure just what, should have been
done about the encore. It wasn't
any fun at all to watch the strained
exhaustion on the dancers' faces as
they grimly did It again.
"Strangler" was Charlie Bulotti's
last Ram's Head job at Stanford,
and, from his standpoint (that of
director), it couldn't have been
better.
That there was much to be criti
cized in "I'm a Strangle!' Here My
self," is pretty well agreed upon by
the campus at large. However, those
who did not have a good time during
most of the evening are in the mi
nority. Consensus seems to be that,
as a work of art in the humor field,
it just wasn't; as a funny show, it
was swell.

If the proceedings could have been
reversed, with the first act coming
second and the second act coijiing
first, it is probable that opinion
would have been overwhelmingly
favorable. The second act, especially
the last scene, could not compare
with the first in tempo, comedy, and
