Dr. Liljencrantz, assistant profes
sor of medicine, "Since most modem
airplanes can out-perform their pi
lots in one respect or another, it is
up to both aeronautical engineer
and flight surgeon to devise means
whereby the adverse physiological
forces thus introduced can be
overcome.
"Many of the problems facing
aivators, said Dr. Liljencrantz, "and
their flight surgeons today will be
seen to differ little from those facing
any normal intelligent adult in a
high-salaried group in the productive
stage of his life. The preservation
of health and efficiency at the high
est. possible level is as important
here as in other vocations."
