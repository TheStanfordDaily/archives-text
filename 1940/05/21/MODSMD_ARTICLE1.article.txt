### WILSON CANNON 
JTALY moved over yesterday to
give Russia room in the "we worry
the world" neutral corner.
The Soviet nation, after several
weeks of diplomatic silence, moved
threateningly close to Rumania-
Hungary borders. Reports that Rus
sian troops were "maneuvering" near
these Balkans countries were alarm
ingly not denied in Moscow.
Italy has long occupied the po
sition of Europe's key neutral.
Balkan observers last night inti
mated that a new Russian attitude
in that region labelled the Soviet
country as "holder of the key to
the Balkans."
Internationally spotlighted as Eu
rope's powder-keg, Balkan develop
ments yesterday intimated that at
tempted surprise raids from any
quarter would be met with fierce re
sistance.
Focal points of Russian measures
yesterday were the Bessarabian sec
tors of Rumania, and Hungary's
Carpatho-Ukraine.
Nervous centers throughout the
Balkans were of the opinion that
Russia was maneuvering for imme
diate intervention should World
War II spread to that sector of the
continent.
Within the Balkan capitols the
pessimistic feeling spread that the
next week or 10 days may answer
the question of whether the war will
spread to their nations or not.
Despite denials of unusual mili
tary preparations, Balkan centers
hummed with activity. Press and ra
dio warnings continually fed defense
instructions to the civilian populace.

O* the Western Front, German
forces spread their drive to in
clude a strong attack apparently
aimed at the channel ports about
Calais.
Led by monstrous tank battalions,
the Nazi spearhead appeared deter
mined to spilt the main French and
British armies into two separate
unities. Contacts at vital points
along the Ailied line were, kept
open, but only after hours of in
tensified combat.
The French claimed the German
juggernaut had been "slowed down."
United Press dispatches, however,
brought no French claim to com
pletely stopping the advance of
Reich forces.
Paris dispatches even admitted
that the bulge toward that city in the
region of Laon had been increased
by heavy German attacks during the
past 24 hours.
French hopes were high, how
ever, despite the continued suc
cesses of the Reich spearhead.
Optimism was based, curiously
enough, on the phenomenal speed
of the front-running spearhead
itself.
Allied military technicians claimed
that the opening German wedge
moved so fast that the bulk of the
Nazi forces is unable to establish
close contacts with it. They inti
mated last night that an Allied en
circling attack might divide German
forces into two separate entities.
German mechanized divisions
1 moved closer to the channel,
English defense circles last night
mused over three lessons learned
during opening months of World
War 11.
First, was the bitter lesson swal
lowed during the Norwegian cam
paign. British pride in the invinci
bility of the warship went shimmer
ing over the horizon, as Reich air
bombers outfought the flower of the
English navy.
Second, was the new part played
by the bomber in attacks on land.
New-found mobility and speed en
abled the German air force to al
most entirely supersede artillery
during certain attacks.
Third, was the need for a Brit
ish cabinet minister to co-ordinate
matters of defense. Such a cabi
net minister would focus his en
tire attention on personal inspec
tion of defense matters.
The third lesson is presently the
most important. Nineteen principal
countries have a cabinet minister
of defense. Such a minister controls,
not co-ordinates, the army, navy,
and air forces.

The Soviet nation, after several

O* the Western Front, German
forces spread their drive to in
clude a strong attack apparently
aimed at the channel ports about
Calais.
Led by monstrous tank battalions,
the Nazi spearhead appeared deter
mined to spilt the main French and
British armies into two separate
unities. Contacts at vital points
along the Ailied line were, kept
open, but only after hours of in
tensified combat.
The French claimed the German
juggernaut had been "slowed down."
United Press dispatches, however,
brought no French claim to com
pletely stopping the advance of
Reich forces.
Paris dispatches even admitted
that the bulge toward that city in the
region of Laon had been increased
by heavy German attacks during the
past 24 hours.
French hopes were high, how
ever, despite the continued suc
cesses of the Reich spearhead.
Optimism was based, curiously
enough, on the phenomenal speed
of the front-running spearhead
itself.
Allied military technicians claimed
that the opening German wedge
moved so fast that the bulk of the
Nazi forces is unable to establish
close contacts with it. They inti

circling attack might divide German
forces into two separate entities.
