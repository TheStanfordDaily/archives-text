# Gay Nineties Play Reading Held Tonight
## Current Broadway Play by Clarence Day Scheduled on Series 
### 
A three-act form of Clarence
Day's "Life with Father" will be
read by Mrs. Guy Stevens Far
rington tonight for the Tuesday
Evening Series at 7:30 o'clock in
Memorial Hall.
"Father" is the well-meaning but
impulsive and stubborn head of a
family of four little boys in gay
'nineties New York. He loves his
jwife Vinnie, and tries to do his duty
jby his four sons, but sometimes they
■baffle his best intended efforts.
Well known in the university
community for her play readings,
Mrs. Farrington has appeared in the
Tuesday Evening Series several
ytimes.
In "Life with Father," the play
made from the book of the same title
and acknowledged by critics as one
of the outstanding stage productions
of the year, the life of the moder
ately wealthy New Yorker in the
;1890's is shown.
Not peculiar to 1890 New York,
■however, are Father's efforts to
jteach his sons to be gentlemen, to
'make his wife economical, to per
suade her to keep neat expense ac
counts. Critics find part of the pro
duction's popularity explained in
the familiarity of the scenes.
