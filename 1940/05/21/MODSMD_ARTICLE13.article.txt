# Green Scours Dime Stores For Costumes
## 
### JAN GOULD 
The crown of England from a
ten-cent store, golden armor with
a Flit gnn and cardboard, rare
velvets from the wash goods coun
terâ€”and Helen Green can do it all.
The head of Stanford's costuming
department has been dealing with
the world's most exotic materials for
five years, but it's a big event in her
professional life when she can buy
a remnant-sized length of the real
thing.
$50 A PLAY
Right now, Mrs. Green's chief
worry is the wardrobe for the "Head
less Horseman," one-act opera to be
presented tomorrow night at the Me
morial Theater. For the 35 cast
members she and her staff have de
signed 18th century costumes for 15
men, 13 women, and 7 children.
Total cost: $50.
The allotment provides for mo
hair wigs, queued, curled, and
clubbed (the white one to be saved
for an 18th century English comedy
next year); for velvet corduroy
breeches and frock coats, flowered
waistcoats, ruffles, buckles. For the
women it includes overdresses, un
derdresses, petticoats, and mob
caps.
GIRLS GET LEFTOVERS
The men's costumes are all new,
while the women will wear re
vamped hand - me - downs from
Shakespeare's peasants. Materials
are organdy, batiste, cretonne, and
rayon.
Mrs. Green, with the help of her
advanced students, who are capable
of taking complete wardrobes off her
hands, has been responsible for some
of the best technical effects and the
most important audience reactions in
the plays of the last three years.
COLORS SUIT ACTION
For instance, Mrs. Green ex
plained, in Richard 11, Richard wore
definite stirring colors until, in the
second act, he appeared in positive
black oilcloth and a red and white
cloak, as his character reached its
peak of glory. From then on, the
theory continuing, his clothes be
came somber, greyer until his death.
Max Reinhardt, world-famous pro
ducer, was deeply impressed with
Mrs. Green's techniques in simu
lating rich materials, expressing most
interest in the armor which was
gilded cardboard, and in the heavy
embroidery on Richard's cape, made
from buckram molded over clay
forms.
