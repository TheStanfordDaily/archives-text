# Germany Claims Drive Toward Channel Ports Traps Allies in Belgium
## Second Battle of Somme Threatens As Nazi Mechanized Units Capture Laon; French Plan Counter-Attack 
### 
BERLIN, Tuesday, May 21 (UP). —German armies in France pointed
a strong force at Amiens and the Sommc Valley leading to the English
Channel today after taking Laon yesterday and extending the center of
their bulge toward Paris, Nazis claimed.
At the same time, German military sources in a guarded statement sug-

•gested an operation may have been
completed surrounding British, Bel
gian and French troops new re
treating before strong German pres
sure in Belgium.
These sources said the report, if
verified, would mean the surround
ing of 350,000 British, 350,000 French,
and about 300,000 Belgians.
Neutral observers checking against
war maps and high command com
muniques found the only area where
a million Allied troops — including
British and Belgians—could be trap
ped is in Belgium. There appeared to
be only two German operations
which might make possible such a
feat. They were:
TWO CHANCES
1. Pincers blows southwards from
the Dendre sector in Belgium and
northwards from the Cambrai re
gion in France, the jaws meeting
somewhere north or west of Valen
ciennes.
2. A slashing blow westward from
Cambrai along the shortest route to
the English Channel, trapping all
Allied troops north of the line of
march.
Observers felt possibly the form
of the guarded German claim indi
cated an operation had been accom
plished with a rapid tank attack, but
more definite announcement was
being held up awaiting a follow-up
by motorized infantry to .secure the
new position.
CHANNEL OBJECTIVE
The current main German drive
in France appeared to be aimed at.
the French channel ports, for the
double objective of cutting off Brit
ish, French and Belgian forces now
retreating through Belgium before
heavy German pressure and to gain
the closest possible "jumping off
place" for launching German at
tacks on England.
From this salient aimed at the
channel, German forces yesterday
stormed southward and took Laon,
raising the Nazi war flag over this
city 75 miles northwest of Paris.
The sudden German drive on the
English Channel, based on the
sound strategy of "divide and con
quer," has the Allies gravely wor
ried and would seem to have an ex
cellent chance of quick success.
QUICK SUCCESS NEEDED
Success at all would have to be
quick. A matter of days, perhaps
hours, should determine the success
or failure of the bold German plan.
The maneuver has developed into a
desperate race between swift. Ger
man mechanized forces rolling
northwest in France parallel to the
Belgian border, and a force of nearly
1,000,000 British, Belgians, and
French retreating from Belgium I<>
save themselves from being cut off.
Whether or not the Germans are
successful in reaching the Channel
and cutting off these Allied forces,
the next great battle probably will
be on the River Somme in the vicin
ity of Amiens.
If German units in sufficient force
win the race to the Channel, the
French main forces now being
gathered for a full-dress counter
attack no doubt will strike hard
northwest of Amiens in an effort to
establish contact with and rescue
the Allied forces now threatened
with encirclement in Belgium.

save themselves from being cut off.
Whether or not the Germans are
successful in reaching the Channel
and cutting off these Allied forces,
the next great battle probably will
be on the River Somme in the vicin
ity of Amiens.
If German units in sufficient force
win the race to the Channel, the
French main forces now being
gathered for a full-dress counter
attack no doubt will strike hard
northwest of Amiens in an effort to
establish contact with and rescue
the Allied forces now threatened

BERLIN, Tuesday, May 21 (UP). —German armies in France pointed
a strong force at Amiens and the Sommc Valley leading to the English
Channel today after taking Laon yesterday and extending the center of
their bulge toward Paris, Nazis claimed.
At the same time, German military sources in a guarded statement sug-

•gested an operation may have been
completed surrounding British, Bel
gian and French troops new re
treating before strong German pres
sure in Belgium.
These sources said the report, if
verified, would mean the surround
ing of 350,000 British, 350,000 French,
and about 300,000 Belgians.
Neutral observers checking against
war maps and high command com
muniques found the only area where
a million Allied troops — including
British and Belgians—could be trap
ped is in Belgium. There appeared to
be only two German operations
which might make possible such a
feat. They were:
TWO CHANCES
1. Pincers blows southwards from
the Dendre sector in Belgium and
northwards from the Cambrai re
gion in France, the jaws meeting
somewhere north or west of Valen
ciennes.
2. A slashing blow westward from
Cambrai along the shortest route to
the English Channel, trapping all
Allied troops north of the line of
march.
Observers felt possibly the form
of the guarded German claim indi
cated an operation had been accom
plished with a rapid tank attack, but
more definite announcement was
being held up awaiting a follow-up
by motorized infantry to .secure the
new position.
CHANNEL OBJECTIVE
The current main German drive
in France appeared to be aimed at.
the French channel ports, for the
double objective of cutting off Brit
ish, French and Belgian forces now
retreating through Belgium before
heavy German pressure and to gain
the closest possible "jumping off
place" for launching German at
tacks on England.
From this salient aimed at the
channel, German forces yesterday
stormed southward and took Laon,
raising the Nazi war flag over this
city 75 miles northwest of Paris.
The sudden German drive on the
English Channel, based on the
sound strategy of "divide and con
quer," has the Allies gravely wor
ried and would seem to have an ex
cellent chance of quick success.
QUICK SUCCESS NEEDED
Success at all would have to be
quick. A matter of days, perhaps
hours, should determine the success
or failure of the bold German plan.
The maneuver has developed into a
desperate race between swift. Ger
man mechanized forces rolling
northwest in France parallel to the
Belgian border, and a force of nearly
1,000,000 British, Belgians, and
French retreating from Belgium I<>
save themselves from being cut off.
