# U.S. Heads Act on F.R. Defense Bill
## Federal, Business Officials Co-operate On Huge Program 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 20 (UP).—
Government, Congressional, indus
trial and Army anil Navy leaders
moved swiftly on a broad front
tonight to translate the $3,124,921,-
732 defense program and President
Roosevelt's 50,000-warplanc objec
tive into actuality.
Though some of the aviation con
ferees claimed the government had
made no concrete proposals for mon
etary assistance in the expansion of
their production facilities, Federal
Loan Administrator Jesse Jones sub
sequently made an announcement
that was expected to leave a loop
hole for such aid.
Jones said the Reconstruction Fi
nance Corporation is prepared to
take 75 per cent of any secured loan
made by banks for production on
plant expansion in connection with
the national defense program.
BLANK CHECK' OKEIIED
Included in the Senate Appropria
tions Committee's report is a "blank
check" authorization of $132,000,000
—half in cash and half in contractu
ral authority—compared with $200,-
000,000 asked by Mr. Roosevelt.
Under the measure, the President
must report to Congress on or be
fore June 30, 1942, on disposition of
the money. A coalition drive to
eliminate the "blank check" funds
failed.
The committee report adds $50,-
000,000 to the Army increase re
quested by Mr. Roosevelt in order
to bring the Army force to a peace
time strength of 280,000. However, it
killed subcommittee recommenda
tions that $1,551,720 be appropriated
and $940,000 be authorized for pur
chasing land at military reservations.
URGES AIR GROWTH
Other major developments on the
defense front:
General George C. Marshall, Army
chief of staff, urged the House Mili
tary Affairs Committee to authorize
the Air Corps to acquire 10,000
planes. The present limit is 6,000
planes.
Marshall also told the Senate ap
propriations subcommittee that the
Army intends to let Alaska provide
itself with its own militia to aug
ment the defensive power of big air
bases there. He said the Army is
anxious to create a National Guard
in Alaska and to start work imme
diately on an air base at Anchorage,
for which $12,000,000 will be appro
priated.

WASHINGTON, May 20 (UP).—
Government, Congressional, indus
trial and Army anil Navy leaders
moved swiftly on a broad front
tonight to translate the $3,124,921,-
732 defense program and President
Roosevelt's 50,000-warplanc objec
tive into actuality.
Though some of the aviation con
ferees claimed the government had
made no concrete proposals for mon
etary assistance in the expansion of
their production facilities, Federal
Loan Administrator Jesse Jones sub
sequently made an announcement
that was expected to leave a loop
hole for such aid.
Jones said the Reconstruction Fi
nance Corporation is prepared to
take 75 per cent of any secured loan
made by banks for production on
plant expansion in connection with
the national defense program.
BLANK CHECK' OKEIIED
Included in the Senate Appropria
tions Committee's report is a "blank
check" authorization of $132,000,000
—half in cash and half in contractu
ral authority—compared with $200,-
000,000 asked by Mr. Roosevelt.
Under the measure, the President
must report to Congress on or be
fore June 30, 1942, on disposition of
the money. A coalition drive to
eliminate the "blank check" funds
failed.
The committee report adds $50,-
000,000 to the Army increase re
quested by Mr. Roosevelt in order
to bring the Army force to a peace
time strength of 280,000. However, it
killed subcommittee recommenda
tions that $1,551,720 be appropriated
and $940,000 be authorized for pur
chasing land at military reservations.
URGES AIR GROWTH
Other major developments on the
defense front:
General George C. Marshall, Army
chief of staff, urged the House Mili
tary Affairs Committee to authorize
the Air Corps to acquire 10,000
planes. The present limit is 6,000
planes.
Marshall also told the Senate ap
propriations subcommittee that the
Army intends to let Alaska provide
itself with its own militia to aug
ment the defensive power of big air
bases there. He said the Army is

in Alaska and to start work imme
