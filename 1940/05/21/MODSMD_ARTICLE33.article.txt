ABOUT CABBAGES
AND SPORTS
Hopes of Circle S men that they
would get a first-hand look at the
only retired world heavyweight
boxing champion, Gene Tunney,
were rudely shattered the other day.
Tunney was to appear personally
Thursday night to give five Card
boxers the famous Tunney Awards.
Attempts in the past to get the
twice-master of Jack Dcmpscy to
present his own awards—llo other
American college is honored by
like awards from Tunney or any
other lighter—have failed.
Coach Harry Maloney was almost
certain that the popular Tunney
would be able to make it this year
to the Circle S banquet, but at the
last minute he was informed that
Tunney has been invited to be pres
ent at the Washington and Jeffer
son University commencement exer
cises the next morning.
So new prexy Bill Weeden, in
terfratei nity secretary, water
poloer, hackstroker, and generally
8.M.0.C., has arranged to have
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur present the
awards as he did last year in Tun
ney's absence.
We'd thought of a lot of ques
tions to ask Tunney, for instance,
what he had to say about the "long
count" Dempsey claims the referee
gave him in that first bout in Phila
delphia. It'll probably be a long
time before Dempsey forgets that
incident.
A couple of years ago, Demp
sey still remembered. He was at
a banquet at which the ref was
present. Dcmpscy by happen
stance had to talk to this ref, who
thought that the Mauler had for
gotten the incident.
'"Sure, bygones are bygones,"
Dempsey said. "To show you, I've
sent you a present; you should re
ceive it tomorrow."
The ref did — it was a dollar
pocket watch.

CIRCLE Sis in its 28th year,
having been founded in 1913 with
Harry Maloney one of its charter
■members. Lynn Murray, brother of
x \ie cartoonist Feg, was also a
charter member, Harry remembers.
Figuring that about 25 men a
year become members of Circle S
Society, the group must he around
700 strong today.

| Besides Tunney, President Wil
bur, former President Herbert C.
Hoover, and Dr. Thomas Storey are
honorary members of the organiza
tion. The minor coaching stafl of
Nort Thornton, Clayton Frye, Eddie
i Twiggs, Myron Sprague, Elwyn
Bugge, are also honorary members,
as are Graduate Manager A1 Mas
ters, and Dr. Ben Davies, one of the
j team physicians and hygiene in
| structor.

DR. FIIITZ ROTII operated on
Marston (Mushy) Girard's leg last
Friday night. Reports were that
Mush was to be up and around by
! the first of this week and running
inside of two or three weeks.
It was the first operation of its
kind, our informant tells us, and
after Dr. Roth was through with
it, he declared it to he a success.
Dr. Roth had to remove a blood
I clot in Mushy's right leg, and with
j the help of live flesh and some wire
Ihe had to tie together the muscle in
j his thigh which had become com-
I pletely separated as the result of his
j last race at the Fresno Relays.
llis running despite the injury
and pain which goes with it goes
a long way to show how much
running means to Guard. He
wanted to run too badly to let
anyone know how much each step
hurt. It takes lots of intestinal
fortitude to do that.
Mushy is lost, of course, to the
P.C.C. meet and with it a chance to
perform in the P.C.C.-Big Ten meet
in Evanston, 111., but he will get a
crack at the N.C.2A. in Minneapolis
and the National Senior A.A.U. in
Fresno the last of June.
And with all his courage, we'll
bet (hat he'll he one of the first
five in both meets; there wouldn't
he any doubt about his placing if
this injury hadn't got him just be
fore the U.S.C. meet.
