# Indian Hopes Dim as Jeffrey, Girard. Hayes Suffer injuries
## 
### 
Hopes for a Stanford victory Saturday in the annual Pacific Coast Con
ference track and field meet were dimmed yesterday, when it was learned
that Sid Hayes, the Cards' ace hurdler, would lie out of the meet. Hayes
has nut come around as expected, causing Coach Bili Ellington to declare
him out of the hurdle races.
Mushy Girard, the distance star, was operated on Saturday for a torn

>muscle in his leg and doctors an
nounce that he will be out of com
petition until the A.A.U. meet late
in June.
JEFF UNDER WRAPS
Clyde Jeffrey has working
under wraps so far this week, fa
voring a foot injury and will not
stretch himself until Wednesday.
Whether Jeff will be in top shape
for his expected two wins in the
sprints is doubtful and Stanford
chances for a title hang in the bal
ance.
Coach Ellington said that Burman
Skrable, the Cards' middle distance
man, will also be out of the meet.
A full squad of 18 men will make
the trip to Los Angeles, but no
names have definitely been listed as
yet.
NORTHERN STARS
A host of track stars will pile
into the Coliseum from the northern
half of the Pacific Coast Conference.
Washington State, the North's
down several outstanding competi
tors. Leading them will be the in
imitable Dixie Garner, who is the
cream of the coast's two milers with
a time of 9:24.5, Garner also runs a
snappy mile, but will have to step
to break in ahead of Stanford's Paul
Moore, and Trojans Zamperini and
Weed. Lee Orr, also of Washington
State, has times of 21.3 in the 220
and 47.3 in the quarter mile.
From Washington will come Jim
Todd in the quarter and Jim Mc-
Goldrick in the hurdles. McGold
rick in the hurdles. McGoldrick has
run 14.9 in the highs.
Oregon's entries will be headed by
Captain Storli, who has toured 880
yards in the fast time of 1:54.8. From
Idaho comes a mile named Liebowitz
who runs in the 4.12'5, another rea
son why that mile race will be one
of "classics" of this track year.
