# Card Mine Unable To Schedule Foes
## 
### 
Because the soldier boys from
Moffett Field cannot find enough
time off from their duties to play
baseball, it looks as if Stanford's
1941 nine will have no more games
during the current spring practice
period.
Although he would really like to
have his crew get some game expe
rience under its collective belt, Coach
Harry Wolter announced yesterday
that the lack of opposition would
probably mean the end of the spring
games for the Cards this year. Wol
ter can't even get a game with any
of the local semi-pro outfits because
the latter are usually made up of
working men who play ball on Sun
days only.
The Card baseballers went through
a snappy intra-squad game yester
day.
