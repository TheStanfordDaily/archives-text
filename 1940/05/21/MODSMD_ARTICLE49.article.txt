# Poloists Entrain For Utah Series
## 
### 
Members of the varsity polo
squad left this morning for the Uni
versity of Utah, where they will
meet that institution's squad on
Thursday and Saturday of this
week.
A close series was predicted by
Major John Smith, polo coach, in
lieu of Utah's recent 5-2 defeat at
the hands of Southern California,
which had just beat the Farjn squad
by a still closer margin.
The squad scheduled to start
Thursday's game consists of Joe
Smith, Bob Strong, Gale Medlicott,
and Leonard Weisenberg. Stan
Glikbarg and A. T. LaPrade will be
alternates.
There are about 800,000 wind mu
sical instruments in use in the
United States.
