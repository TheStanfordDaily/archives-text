IT wasn't long ago lliat Stanford's Executive Com
' mitlee dinged a plea of the International Student
Service for contributions for students of other coun
tries. who have been hurt by the force of war.
The refusal of Kxcom came soon after the famous
Finnish relief fiasco and was based largely on that
bod\ s willingness to throw up its hands in despair,
li s pretty hard to appease the strict isolationists and
the moralists in the same breath. Kxcom was tired
of Ir\ ing.
Hut the I.S.S. has now had a terrific split in its
own ranks, which makes Kxcom look like a llock
of pseudo-diplomats t<> say the least. It seems that
one element u ithin the Sen ice has obtained e\ idence
that their agene\ in Geneva was using the European
Student Service Fund as a "harmless"' means of in
teresting American students in one side of the Euro
pean war. *1 el the American colleges, the abdicators
insisi. were guaranteed during the collection period
that the distribution would be absolutely non-parti
san and non-political.
"Oh. no. retort the incumbent I.S.S. officials,
"they didn I resign. We fired em because iheywere
sabotaging our whole humanitarian relief effort."
The situation which has developed is obvious.
K\er\bod) is mad at everybody else and everyone's
"a Communist but inc." Kxcom can lake credit for
keeping Stanford out of an organization which has
dilliculh in maintaining neutral policies even among
ils first four or five highest officials.
This chance stand of Stanford's august tribunal
was fortunate. But the incident only proves more
than ever Ihe fact thai The Daily's Campus Com
nuinih Chest, with a strict cheek on all recipient
agencies, is ihc project to solve the Farm's drive
dilemma.
KxhaiMive research into the affairs and audit re
ports ol all the Chest members can easily be ef
fected under the plan. At present Stanford either
gives or snubs, with no apparent assurance that
I lies are or are not helping the right causes.
Cohesion, research, publicity and generous contri
bution theseÂ»would be the assets of a Campus
Couuuunilv Chest.
