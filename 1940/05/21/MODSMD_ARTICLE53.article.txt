## DRYDO'S TALE 
### 
r PHE EDITOR, SIR:
I am enclosing for your perusal a recently found
unpublished fragment by Drydo. It was discovered
among some of his heretofore unidentified papers. Al
though the poem unfortunately breaks off in the mid
dle, I thought perhaps you might be interested in
all or part of it.
Sincerely yours
Newton Russell, '40

As swiftly change I to a last year's file
As sadly do events my mind beguile
So ere this senior race is run I'll leave
With you these thoughts which make me grieve
The day s bright lord ascends his hemisphere
Each dawn and does at eve then disappear
And with him goes all light for me
Bv dim Reserve Room tapers cannot see.
So easily does this your year darkness act
Those glowing orbs lose power to contract.
Then optometric voices costly say
Twas poor library light caused this decay.
Administration should such ills allav.
Hut Lampus. farewell. Phaeton, besides you
Others in my ode must have their due:
My muse could sing a classic song of price
For Union's drop of orange juice in rice

Or Bookstore's yearly profit sacrifice.
Such plaintive, useless cries I've heard before;
They neither scotch nor kill the snake, that's
sure.
I'll broach a toast (nay, Bacchus, pour not here
Libations pure on Zenus Olympian bier)
For when we drink to Mothers Greek, 'tmust be
Not draughts of pungent nectar but bohea,
(Especially weaked for students, naturally.)
Then sing, sweet muse, to mothers twenty-four
And cry that roughy manhood lives no more.
No more will sullied corduroy be seen;
No more will fraternal language be obsence;
Nor joysome meetings down at Belts conveneâ€”
For liberty is dead, dead ere its prime
And false monocrated moralism rules divine.
Smokers are called pow wows which is to say
That if you change his name the dog won't play
Ah well, in four years' facts I fail to see
That we've changed or should our morality.
A dog is not allowed, nor is a gun;
And parties of the campus; only one;
And breathing's really being overdone
All this and more by order of . . .
