# BULL SESSION

SHADOWS ON LIBERTY
IF anyone doubts that American declaration of war
would flirt with Fascism, he need only consider
what the threat of war has done to American public
opinion. Already we are importing that foreign hys
teria and intolerance that accompany organization to
kill.
It is not so much the fact that President Roosevelt
and our army chiefs are asking for 50,000 planes. It
is not so much the fact that our naval and military
appropriations for 1940 will reach the three billion
mark. It is chiefly the way in which these events are
received that makes one feel the chill of intolerance
and bellicosity.
Sunday night Walter Winchell, that lotion man
whose every word is a speech, spoke for many people
when he said that opponents of the new arms expendi
tures are "dangerous and insidious members of Ger
many's fifth column." Congress seems to feel that way
about it too. Senate leaders are praising the military
expansion with sickeningly jingoistic stuff about na
tional loyalty. Anything but unanimity, they feel, is a
definite sign that traitors are at work. The fact that
they are on the majority side, of course, lends to their
remarks a glittering self-evidence in their own eyes.
* * * *
here on the Stanford campus some of us are
becoming intolerant of anti-war sentiment. Strong
advocacy of any stand is not condemnable, but when
strong advocacy is accompanied by high blood pres
sure and name-calling, the spirit of freedom is losing
ground.
A sincere advocate of American alliance with the
Allies wrote to Campus Opinion last week decrying
The Daily's antagonism toward his side of the war
issue. Unfortunately, however, it is not so much a
question of peace proponents' calling the war-bent
speakers hysterical. It is more a question of the war
bent speakers' calling the peace proponents traitors.
That is the ugly word whose over-application is a
symptom of fear, belligerence, and fear's first cousin
窶認ascism.
There should always be room for difference of
opinion in a democracy. But that room is being
crowded bv a jingoistic spirit that will not counte
nance criticism.
No one wants a fifth column in the United States.
But in our anxiety to combat the fifth columns of Eu
rope, we might well watch for Fascism's fifth column
here, a domestic fifth column whose cry is false
patriotism.

But in our anxiety to combat the fifth columns of Eu
rope, we might well watch for Fascism's fifth column
here, a domestic fifth column whose cry is false
patriotism.
SHADOWS ON LIBERTY
IF anyone doubts that American declaration of war
would flirt with Fascism, he need only consider
what the threat of war has done to American public
opinion. Already we are importing that foreign hys
teria and intolerance that accompany organization to
kill.
It is not so much the fact that President Roosevelt
and our army chiefs are asking for 50,000 planes. It
is not so much the fact that our naval and military
appropriations for 1940 will reach the three billion
mark. It is chiefly the way in which these events are
received that makes one feel the chill of intolerance
and bellicosity.
Sunday night Walter Winchell, that lotion man
whose every word is a speech, spoke for many people
when he said that opponents of the new arms expendi
tures are "dangerous and insidious members of Ger
many's fifth column." Congress seems to feel that way
about it too. Senate leaders are praising the military
expansion with sickeningly jingoistic stuff about na
tional loyalty. Anything but unanimity, they feel, is a
definite sign that traitors are at work. The fact that
they are on the majority side, of course, lends to their
remarks a glittering self-evidence in their own eyes.

here on the Stanford campus some of us are
becoming intolerant of anti-war sentiment. Strong
advocacy of any stand is not condemnable, but when
strong advocacy is accompanied by high blood pres
sure and name-calling, the spirit of freedom is losing
ground.
A sincere advocate of American alliance with the
Allies wrote to Campus Opinion last week decrying
The Daily's antagonism toward his side of the war
issue. Unfortunately, however, it is not so much a
question of peace proponents' calling the war-bent
speakers hysterical. It is more a question of the war
bent speakers' calling the peace proponents traitors.
That is the ugly word whose over-application is a
symptom of fear, belligerence, and fear's first cousin
窶認ascism.
There should always be room for difference of
opinion in a democracy. But that room is being
crowded bv a jingoistic spirit that will not counte
nance criticism.
No one wants a fifth column in the United States.
