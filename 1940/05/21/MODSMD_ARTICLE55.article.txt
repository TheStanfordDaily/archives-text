# Another Man's View
## OBSERVATIONS ON THE STANFORD FRATERNITY SYSTEM 
### BOB MOULTON 
President of Intcrfratcrnity Council
r JHHERE are various subjects I find easier to discuss
in an ordinary fraternity room bull session than
the Stanford fraternity system. But with the exodus
of the perennial genial McDuffie, I am in a unique
position to discuss the Stanford fraternity system on
the basis of a year's experience as Interfratemity
President. Also I am probably in less danger of being
challenged than I always am in the fraternity room
discussions on the various other subjects. Therefore
I am taking this opportunity to summarize certain
personal observations regarding fraternities accumu
lated during the course of a year, jr better, four years.
Over a decade or more the fraternities have expe
rienced various administrative successes and failures
and certain difficulties with the University adminis
tration. Because of the limited space it is only of these
difficulties that I am going to write. They seem to
be cyclical in nature and similar or identical in char
acter when one consults the records. These difficulties
are to me manifestations of an ever-present, potential
incompatibility between fraternities and the adminis
tration. And the remedy for this potential incompati
bility does not lie completely within the hands of
either body, although the responsibility for constant
effort at alleviation is that of the fraternities.
The administration has certain policies to maintain
and any group in the University must conduct itself
in harmony with these policies or consider itself an
heretic group liable to the measures provided for dis
cipline. Responsible fraternity leaders concur in this
opinion. Much has been done in finance, scholarship,
and living conditions to refine the system. Progress in
these fields has been satisfactory.

JJOWEVER. for two reasons I believe that certain
social difficulties between the administration and
fraternities will always exist in varying degrees. First,
the principle of close living inherent in fraternities
leads them on certain occasions to flagrant, abuses re
sulting from mass psychology. Thus, bound together in
sects, they indulge in individually condemned and mu
tually condoned practices, such as the ridiculous and
aboriginal physical punishment meted out to their
"candidates" in initiatory ordeals. These practices mani
fest a lack of civilization and maturity.
The second reason why fraternities often appear in
a poor public light is also found in the nature of their
organization. This reason is. namely, that a fraternity
man's actions, good or bad, but especially bad, are in
discriminately ascribed by police to the whole group.
A drunk from Branner is a happy individual from
room number . An inebriate from Sigma Delta
Phi—also happy—typifies automatically 40 individuals.
Stanford fraternities have other negative elements
which I think are less important. Among them are: a
very small portion of false aristocracy, poor study con
ditions, poor methods of intrahouse training and selec
tion of leaders, and often only a cursory acquaintance
ship with those invited to join.
These things I point out not to indict the frater
nity system but to try to make clear some of the ele
ments which I believe constantly threaten its standing
as a desirable institution. The price of its advantages
is constant attention to and refinement of its own po
tentially vulnerable points. The number of difiiculties
between fraternities and the administration will be in
inverse proportion to the care givt-n them by the fra
ternities.
