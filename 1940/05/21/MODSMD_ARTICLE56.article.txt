"Burma Road," by Nicoll Smith.
Bobks-Mcrrill.
Globe-trotter and lecturer Nicoll
Smith had been hearing about the
mysterious Burma Road for two
years, and he determined to travel
that near-legendary highway. They
told him it couldn't be done—that the
Chinese would never let him travel
this road, considered so strategic
that the Chinese are even cagey
about admitting its existence.
But he knew a few people — the
l ight people—and finally he got per
mission to travel the road together
with his friend, the American consul
at Yunan-fu.
This is ex-Stanford-man Smith's
first book, and it seems to me he
missed the boat. However, I sup
pose it would take a man who
really knew China and the ins-and
outs of the present Sino-Japanese
"incident" to explain and interpret
the far-reaching consequences of
this 700-mile highway from Yunan
fu down into British Burma. You
have to draw your own conclusions
here, because Smith has chosen to
skip implications in favor of what
amounts to a pretty good Halliburton
travel yarn.
During his trip up to Yunan-fu,
through Singapore and French
Indo-China he runs into, and tells
about, many of those interesting
people of all races who clutter up
the Orient. There's a weird yarn
about a beautiful Annamite girl with
a penchant for lethal love potions,
and a meeting with a sinister dope
czar among others.
On the sociological studies side,
his description of the Kochiu tin
mines will stick in your memory for
some time. In these huge mines the
tunnels are so low and narrow that
only children can work in them.

i These youngsters are sold to the
mine owners when they are about
6 years old. The mortality rate
among them is about 10,000 a year,
and those that don't die go blind be
cause of the arsenic in the tin-pro
ducing earth.
Another of these pleasant little
tales concerns a child, whom the
Chinese refer to as "the-girl-who
never-moves." She lives in a Cath
olic home for slave-girls. It seems
that when she was seven her mistress
became angry at her, and burned
out the top of her head with a hot
iron. .
He tells all about the road, but he
doesn't tell you much about what it
means. He really doesn't have to.
The matter is reall ytaken care of
when he tells of the Chinese char
acters painted on a cliff high above
a 13th century monument to Kublai
Khan. In translation they say:
"This road was built by the natives
: of this district without the aid of
j foreign implements.—Nowell
