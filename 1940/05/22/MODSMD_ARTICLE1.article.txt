### WILSON CANNON 
\V/ HEN the Premier of a warring i
nation takes down his hair and
admits that things look bad—he isn't
trying to be dramatic.
Yesterday France's Paul Reynaud
prayed for a miracle to halt the |
steady onrush of victorious Nazi |
forces.
Faces of French Senators gray- I
ed, as Reynaud gave them a !
straight-from-the-shoulder picture
of the plight their country was
facing. The stocky little premier
recalled the 1914 "angel of the
Marne" and admitted that another
miracle might he necessary to save
the nation from Germany's war
machine.
Reynaud believes the miracle
will come. He said yesterday that
"the power above" would not allow
the two great peoples of France and
England to meet defeat.
The premier's admission that "the
Fatherland is endangered" received
much positive proof as yesterday's
events unfolded to completion.
On the flat lowlands of the French
central plain, a smooth-working
German juggernaut worked to within
G5 miles of Paris. Nazi front line
patrols reported seeing the Eiffel
tower through field glasses.
A second prong of Der Reichsfueh
rer's attacking forces made an un
believable gain which gave it a foot
hold upon the English Channel.
The lightning German thrust to
the channel separated the main
French and British armies and
trapped almost 1,000,000 men in an
untenable position. Approximately
330,000 of these were members of
the British Expeditionary Force.
* * *
■ the French Senate gasped over
Reynaud's account of the latest
developments of World War 11, the
premier continued with an almost
unbelievable account of how and
why the Germans remained unstop
ped.
Ignoring all the cardinal rules
of retreat, Reynaud charged, the
French army on the Meuse River
failed to blow up key bridges be
hind them. This, plus other blun
ders by French forces, allowed the
German vanguard to cross the
Meuse.
Reynaud's charges were highly
reminiscent of certain official er
rors committed during Poland's de
fense which allowed the swift
German victory.
The premier made no direct accu
sation of tactical sabotage, however.
But the tone of his Senate address
implied that "fifth column" activities
played no small part in the German
victory.
S|! S|! #
I)ARAMOUNT question in Allied
centers yesterday was:
"Will Der Fuehrer concentrate his
power toward England; or will he
continue his overland drive toward
Paris?"
Consensus of international opinion
last night held that the British Isles
would be the target for the Hitler
attack.
United Press dispatches last night
lent a touch of certainty to this be
lief. London officially admitted that
German bombers had attacked the
southeastern portion of the British
Isles.
Johann Citizen, and his compan
ions on German streets arc after
England. There has been only bare
mention of France in any of the dis
patches emanating from Berlin.
After every German radio pro
gram a record plays a song, which
translated means "And We'll Go
Marching to England." If a popu
larity poll were held in the Reich,
(his song would undoubtedly be
tops. It is sung everywhere on
the streets.
Through the German lines, a feel
ing of pride is reportedly felt con
cerning the possibility of Nazi in
vasion of the British Isles.
Reich officers and soldiers say, in
effect:
"This 900 years of English invinci
bility is overdue. And Herr Hitler
and his armies are the boys who are
going to turn the trick."
And the English bands are learn
ing the English tune:
"The world turned upside down."

Through the German lines, a feel

the nation from Germany's war
machine.
Reynaud believes the miracle
will come. He said yesterday that
"the power above" would not allow
the two great peoples of France and
England to meet defeat.
The premier's admission that "the
Fatherland is endangered" received
much positive proof as yesterday's
events unfolded to completion.
On the flat lowlands of the French
central plain, a smooth-working
German juggernaut worked to within
G5 miles of Paris. Nazi front line
patrols reported seeing the Eiffel
tower through field glasses.
A second prong of Der Reichsfueh

believable gain which gave it a foot
hold upon the English Channel.
The lightning German thrust to
the channel separated the main
French and British armies and
trapped almost 1,000,000 men in an
untenable position. Approximately
330,000 of these were members of
the British Expeditionary Force.
