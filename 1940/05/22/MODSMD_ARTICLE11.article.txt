# Student Cast To Produce 'Horseman' Satire at 8:15
## 
### JAN GOULD 
Tonight., alter three months of in
tensive effort on the part of the
music and drama departments, the
Benet-Moorc satire of "The Head
less Horseman" will hit the boards
of Memorial Hall at 8:15 o'clock, for
a one-night, stand.
For the last time last night, the
chorus and principals were put
through their paces in two sizzling
run-offs by Nicholas Goldschmidt,
while technicians sat out front and
figured out their jobs for tonight.
F. Cowles Strickland, stage direc
tor of the opera, prowled up and
down the aisles, watching the pro
duction from all angles. Helen Green,
costume head, sat alone in the middle
section, noting minor changcs in
wardrobes.
CHILDREN PRACTICE
" â€”for kissing my daughter, why
damme, you oughter be burned in a
very slow flame," sang Emerson Hi
ler, bass, to Brad Young. At his

side Barbara Caswell stood anxiously
by, dodging one time as the big
track man jumped in the air lo crack
his heels and strolled into the next
verse of Cornelius Van Tassel's
sledgehammer whimsy.
"Good. The children now. Joel?"
Mr. Goldschmidt rapped on his music
stand and the orchestra blared as a
flock of children borrowed from Palo
Alto grammar schools scurried in
around the dowdy, rusty black figure
of Joel Carter as Ichabod Crane.
ACTION ON SINGLE SKT
Their shrill voices screeched out,
cjncouraged by Mr. Goldschmidt;
they danced as they sang, teasing
Ichabod until he scattered them with
whooshes and spats on the breeches;
and the last rehearsal continued
without a hitch through the finale.
The action of the hour-and-a-half
long piece takes place on a single set
of deep window seats, diamond
paned windows, wainscoting, and a
blue and white tile fireplace.
