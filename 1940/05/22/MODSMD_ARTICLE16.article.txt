# Diving 'Stuka' Planes Blast Path For March to Coast; Germans See 'Beginning of End' for Allied Cause

Stark calamity struck the Allies with the smashing thrust
of German mechanized divisions to the English Channel, their
path cleared by the cerrible "Stuka" bombers against which
Britain and France seemingly have no effective defense.
Adolf Hitler's blitzkrieg, which crushed over the Dutch

► frontier a scant 11 days ago, has
struck fear into the hearts of France
and Britain with a vengeance and,
in the words of the French Premier,
a miracle may be needed to save the
situation.
Two likely possibilities of the im
mediate future begin to emerge in
minds dazed by the phenomenal
speed of the German blow:
1. A new German peace overture
on stiff Berlin terms, especially aimed
at France and the hope of separating
the British and French peoples.

2. German smashes against the
British Isles and against Paris, for
which Hitler's legions are in ex
cellent positions and still possessed
of overwhelming air superiority—
the decisive factor in this war to
date.
Factors bolstering the German
claim that for the Allies the "begin
ning of the end is at hand" include:
1. The admitted separation of the
main French and British armies in
Franco by the chive to the Channel,
which trapped the entire British ex
peditionary force and probably scores
of thousands of French and Belgian
troops as well.
2. The severing by the capture of
Amiens and Abbeville of the shortest
and best Allied telephone and rail
connections between London and
Paris.

3. The acquisition or imminent ac
quisition by Germany of French
Channel ports from which sea com
munications with England may be
out and hordes of Nazi bombers and
parachute troops launched against
England.
4. Crossing of the Sornme by the
Germans at Amiens, between which
point and Paris 80 miles due south
there is "no effective Allied army,"
according to Berlin — adding this
threat to the French capital to that
pointed from the Rethel sector to
the southeast, only 65 miles from
Paris.
5. Increasing evidence in the dis
patches of correspondents on both
sides that Allied air strength—never
equal to that of Germany—is fast
dwindling.
COUNTER-THRUST
The slim hope of the Allies to
snatch from Hitler at the last mo
ment a victory which would rank
with the topmost in history appears
to be a counter-attack quickly
launched with every ounce of power
at their command.
This would mean that the en
trapped B.E.F. and French forces
gathered on the other flank of the
j Germans who reached the coast
