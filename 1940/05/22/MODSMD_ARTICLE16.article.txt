# Diving 'Stuka' Planes Blast Path For March to Coast; Germans See 'Beginning of End' for Allied Cause
## 
### United Press 
Stark calamity struck the Allies with the smashing thrust
of German mechanized divisions to the English Channel, their
path cleared by the cerrible "Stuka" bombers against which
Britain and France seemingly have no effective defense.
Adolf Hitler's blitzkrieg, which crushed over the Dutch

► frontier a scant 11 days ago, has
struck fear into the hearts of France
and Britain with a vengeance and,
in the words of the French Premier,
a miracle may be needed to save the
situation.
Two likely possibilities of the im
mediate future begin to emerge in
minds dazed by the phenomenal
speed of the German blow:
1. A new German peace overture
on stiff Berlin terms, especially aimed
at France and the hope of separating
the British and French peoples.

2. German smashes against the
British Isles and against Paris, for
which Hitler's legions are in ex
cellent positions and still possessed
of overwhelming air superiority—
the decisive factor in this war to
date.
Factors bolstering the German
claim that for the Allies the "begin
ning of the end is at hand" include:
1. The admitted separation of the
main French and British armies in
Franco by the chive to the Channel,
which trapped the entire British ex
peditionary force and probably scores
of thousands of French and Belgian
troops as well.
2. The severing by the capture of
Amiens and Abbeville of the shortest
and best Allied telephone and rail
connections between London and
Paris.

3. The acquisition or imminent ac
quisition by Germany of French
Channel ports from which sea com
munications with England may be
out and hordes of Nazi bombers and
parachute troops launched against
England.
4. Crossing of the Sornme by the
Germans at Amiens, between which
point and Paris 80 miles due south
there is "no effective Allied army,"
according to Berlin — adding this
threat to the French capital to that
pointed from the Rethel sector to
the southeast, only 65 miles from
Paris.
5. Increasing evidence in the dis
patches of correspondents on both
sides that Allied air strength—never
equal to that of Germany—is fast
dwindling.
COUNTER-THRUST
The slim hope of the Allies to
snatch from Hitler at the last mo
ment a victory which would rank
with the topmost in history appears
to be a counter-attack quickly
launched with every ounce of power
at their command.
This would mean that the en
trapped B.E.F. and French forces
gathered on the other flank of the
j Germans who reached the coast
would strike simultaneously. But no
credible signs of such an attack in
lot i c have shown as this is written
and on the other hand, it appeared
possible the British instead would
try to evacuate and sail from Chan
nel ports to escape threatened anni
hilation.
SVv 11-1 REORGANIZATION
This counter-attack hope depends
on the ability of the Allies to reor
ganize quickly in the face of terrible
German air attacks and roads choked
by hundreds of thousands of civilian
refugees.
The principal suggestion that a
new German-dictated peace offer
may be in the offing came from the
German short-wave wireless. It was
voiced in the cultured Oxford accent
of "Lord Haw-Haw," who probably
is much less funny to Britons now
than he was a few weeks tigo.
As received in New York on Tues
day night by the Columbia Broad
casting System listening station,
" Lord Haw-Haw's" nightly propa
ganda address from Germany con
tained these statements, which may
hs significant:
"The question now arises as to
v. bother any further co-operation
b'tween the Allies can be main
tained.

"Nobody would be very surprised
it the British left another gallant ally

German air attacks and roads choked

The principal suggestion that a
new German-dictated peace offer
may be in the offing came from the
German short-wave wireless. It was
voiced in the cultured Oxford accent
of "Lord Haw-Haw," who probably
is much less funny to Britons now
than he was a few weeks tigo.
As received in New York on Tues
day night by the Columbia Broad
casting System listening station,
" Lord Haw-Haw's" nightly propa
ganda address from Germany con
tained these statements, which may

"The question now arises as to

"Nobody would be very surprised

Stark calamity struck the Allies with the smashing thrust
of German mechanized divisions to the English Channel, their
path cleared by the cerrible "Stuka" bombers against which
Britain and France seemingly have no effective defense.
Adolf Hitler's blitzkrieg, which crushed over the Dutch

► frontier a scant 11 days ago, has
struck fear into the hearts of France
and Britain with a vengeance and,
in the words of the French Premier,
a miracle may be needed to save the
situation.
Two likely possibilities of the im
mediate future begin to emerge in
minds dazed by the phenomenal
speed of the German blow:
1. A new German peace overture
on stiff Berlin terms, especially aimed
at France and the hope of separating
the British and French peoples.

2. German smashes against the
British Isles and against Paris, for
which Hitler's legions are in ex
cellent positions and still possessed
of overwhelming air superiority—
the decisive factor in this war to
date.
Factors bolstering the German
claim that for the Allies the "begin
ning of the end is at hand" include:
1. The admitted separation of the
main French and British armies in
Franco by the chive to the Channel,
which trapped the entire British ex
peditionary force and probably scores
of thousands of French and Belgian
troops as well.
2. The severing by the capture of
Amiens and Abbeville of the shortest
and best Allied telephone and rail
connections between London and
Paris.

3. The acquisition or imminent ac
quisition by Germany of French
Channel ports from which sea com
munications with England may be
out and hordes of Nazi bombers and
parachute troops launched against
England.
4. Crossing of the Sornme by the
Germans at Amiens, between which
point and Paris 80 miles due south
there is "no effective Allied army,"
according to Berlin — adding this
threat to the French capital to that
pointed from the Rethel sector to
the southeast, only 65 miles from
Paris.
5. Increasing evidence in the dis
patches of correspondents on both
sides that Allied air strength—never
equal to that of Germany—is fast
dwindling.
COUNTER-THRUST
The slim hope of the Allies to
snatch from Hitler at the last mo

with the topmost in history appears
to be a counter-attack quickly
launched with every ounce of power
at their command.

and Britain with a vengeance and,
in the words of the French Premier,
a miracle may be needed to save the
situation.
Two likely possibilities of the im
mediate future begin to emerge in
minds dazed by the phenomenal
speed of the German blow:
1. A new German peace overture
on stiff Berlin terms, especially aimed
at France and the hope of separating
the British and French peoples.

2. German smashes against the
British Isles and against Paris, for
which Hitler's legions are in ex
cellent positions and still possessed
of overwhelming air superiority—
the decisive factor in this war to
date.
Factors bolstering the German
claim that for the Allies the "begin
ning of the end is at hand" include:
1. The admitted separation of the
main French and British armies in
Franco by the chive to the Channel,
which trapped the entire British ex
peditionary force and probably scores
of thousands of French and Belgian
troops as well.
2. The severing by the capture of
Amiens and Abbeville of the shortest
and best Allied telephone and rail
connections between London and
Paris.

3. The acquisition or imminent ac
quisition by Germany of French
Channel ports from which sea com
munications with England may be
out and hordes of Nazi bombers and
parachute troops launched against
England.
4. Crossing of the Sornme by the
Germans at Amiens, between which
point and Paris 80 miles due south
there is "no effective Allied army,"
according to Berlin — adding this
threat to the French capital to that
pointed from the Rethel sector to
the southeast, only 65 miles from
Paris.
5. Increasing evidence in the dis
patches of correspondents on both
sides that Allied air strength—never
equal to that of Germany—is fast
dwindling.
COUNTER-THRUST
The slim hope of the Allies to
snatch from Hitler at the last mo
ment a victory which would rank
with the topmost in history appears
to be a counter-attack quickly
launched with every ounce of power
at their command.
This would mean that the en
trapped B.E.F. and French forces
gathered on the other flank of the
j Germans who reached the coast
would strike simultaneously. But no
credible signs of such an attack in
lot i c have shown as this is written
and on the other hand, it appeared
possible the British instead would
try to evacuate and sail from Chan
nel ports to escape threatened anni
hilation.
SVv 11-1 REORGANIZATION
This counter-attack hope depends
on the ability of the Allies to reor
ganize quickly in the face of terrible
German air attacks and roads choked
by hundreds of thousands of civilian
refugees.
The principal suggestion that a
new German-dictated peace offer
may be in the offing came from the
German short-wave wireless. It was
voiced in the cultured Oxford accent
of "Lord Haw-Haw," who probably
is much less funny to Britons now
than he was a few weeks tigo.
As received in New York on Tues
day night by the Columbia Broad

" Lord Haw-Haw's" nightly propa

b'tween the Allies can be main

"Nobody would be very surprised
