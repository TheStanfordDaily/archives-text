## Excom Gives Bonus To Keusseff, Russell, 'Informer' Managers 
### DICK DUDMAN 
Two Stanford students earned
$50 apiece last night for a good
idea they thought up a year and
a half ago.
Ex Committee appropriated the
necessary $100 from general funds
as a bonus for Chuck Russell and
Steve KeusselT, manpjers this year
of the "Informer," weekly theater
guide posted on bulletin boards
around the campus.
At the same time, Ex Co nmittee
formulated plans for selection of sub-

This action came wi'.~ considera
ion of minutes of a Publications ]
Council meeting Monday, at which ]
he council denied a request by (
tussell and Keusseff that they be |
llowed to sell the enterprise to next j
'ear's managers. The council set
37.50 apiece as the amount of the ]
>onus, the money to be taken out
if improvement funds of The Daily,
chappie, and The Quad.
This solution was set aside in fa- '
'or of the $50 bonuses from A.S.S.U. (
unds, this amount to be repaid
rom the first $100 of net profit next '
r ear.
'RIVATE DEAL PLANNED
Appearing before Ex Committee at
he meeting last night, Russell and
Ceusseff were asked if they could ,
;et more in the private deal they .
lad planned with two sophomores. .
"Well, we might get a little
nore," said Russell. "They've al- j
eady offered $100 apiece to get it ,
or the next, two years."

my money in addition ,o the $450
hey are making this year.
Â£OBBS OPPOSES SALE
Student Manager John Cobbs led j
opposition to allowing a private sale
>f the "Informer." He read a letter
rom Graduate Manager Alfred R.
Masters supporting this stand on
grounds that Ex Committee was not
obligated to let them sell their
rights bccause "they have no rights."
When someone suggested they
would be satisfied with Publication
Council's scheme instead of the
right to sell the enterprise, she said,
'I don't see how you can possibly
say that they wouldn't like $100
more than whatever half of $75 is."
MASTERS TO CHOOSE
It was decided that Mr. Masters
should be given the job of appoint
ing "Informer" managers from three
suggested teams, a former proposal
having been that the choice be made
by Publications Council, of which
Dr. Chilton R. Bush, director of the
Division of Journalism, is a member.
"If anyone here can show me that
Al Masters can make a better selec
tion than Dr. Bush, I'll eat it," Arch
Jenkins declared.
After an evening of heated con
troversy and roll call votes, this mo
tion was carried without a dissent.
"My God, this is the first unani
mous vote tonight," said Cobbs.
"Boy, we're back in the groove,"
said John Porter.
OTHER BUSINESS
Other business of the evening,
passed easily and without any ex
tended discussion, was as follows: j
WAGE RAISE: At the suggestion
of Quad Editor Newt Russell, Ex
Commtitee deleted the by-law clause
providing for a $90 salary for head
Quad photographer, with the under
standing he would receive $180.
Russell explained that the job of
photographer is becoming increas
ingly important because of the "tran
sition in yearbooks from more pic
tures to more and more pictures.
"Our man has been spending 50
hours a week in the dark room this
quarter, and if you don't think that's
a lot of work, just ask Ed Ducom
mtin. It means working almost
every night until 11 o'clock. He's
got a wife, too, and she doesn't like
it so well either."
JUNIOR ORI ENTER: Because
Charles Van Deusen will be away
all summer, George Jackson was
appointed co-chairman with Audrey
Steele of next fall's junior orienta
tion program.

new constitution was approved on
recommendation of Sylvia Berry's
subcommittee.
