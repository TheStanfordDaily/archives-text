If nothing else does, the big race ,
between Paul Moore and Louie !
Zamperini will stack 'em in at the j
Coliseum Saturday, and all Coasl 1
track and field attendance records I
should be shattered.
From the week before Moore
tiimmed Zamperini's sails in the
Trojan meet, May 4, through this
week, there will be controversies
arising as to the merits of the two
runners. Those who've seen Moore
and Zamp in their four meetings
(twice at U.S.C., once in the Fresno
Relays, and once in last week's !
Finnish Relief) must realize by
this time that the two men are
two entirely different types of
runners.
Neither one runs the same pace
for the four laps . Those who've seen
Paul run and then watch Zamp are
a bit confused, and don't know what
to make of their two gaits. Zam
perini's style looks the more spec
tacular because of his fast first and i
last laps—the last one amounting to [
a sprint with the runner getting up j
on his toes and digging in for the '
final 220 yards.
Paul's system is that of run
ning his laps more evenly, starting
out with a 59 or 60 first lap. and
gradually upping (hat so that from
(ine lap to the next he appears to
be going at the same speed. But if
you had watched the Moorc-Zam
perini battle in the medley relay
down at Fresno, you'd have no
ticed this:
Zamp lit out with a hefty 57-sec- |
ond first lap, while Paul loafed with
a 60-second, falling back so that he
had more than 30 yards to make up.
Zamp's easy, relaxed stride gave
him a 66-second second lap, and
Paul running at almost the same gait
as the first picked up yardage on
him.
The difference between their
third laps was especially notice
able, for Paul caught up with
Zamp at the start of the fourth,
running around 64 or 65, and mak
ing it a 3:09 three-quarters of a
mile. Everyone knows what hap
pened on that fourth lap, for
Zamp only beat Paul by inches in
what was a 62 last lap for both.

HILL ELLINGTON explains that
when Paul gets ready to really run
that mile in record-breaking time,
it'll be a case of Paul's running four
almost identical laps. His first two
would be about (50 and 62; the third
would be either (53 or 64; and the
last lap would be taken care of by
Moore's running the kind of last
lap he did against Zamp at Fresno.
If Paul were to use /amp's pare
set-up and run a fast 57 or 58 first
lap. he could still continue run a
good mile: but with that pace, you
can't talk about bis getting down
Ic. 1:06. which is around world rec
ord time. You have to under-

stand that Paul can't run that fast i
and have anything left in his third
and fourth laps to get down to
4:06.
Zamp, {is we've said, runs fast first
and last laps and eases vip on the
second and third rounds; that's
where the two runners are differ
ent.

IF YOU DON'T KNOW the dif
ference between the way these men
run, then you may get a distorted
view as did one Los Angeles sports ]
writer, Dick Hyland, who wrote an j
article ia yesterday morning's Times
which makes him look stupid when
it comes to judging track perform
ances.
Now I don't say that I know j
more than Ilyland. but 1 do check [
with an authority (mine was Bill
Ellington) and then write from ;
that angle. Hyland couldn't pos
sibly have asked anyone, probably
feeling secure in the fact that he
knew all there was to know [
about milers.
So he said: "It is evident, watch
ing that pair run, that Zamperini
knows much more about, their sport
than does Moore. The latter simply
gets out there and runs while Zam
perini knows what he is doing at all
times. . . . Louie it may be said
knows his game."

for the four laps . Those who've seen
Paul run and then watch Zamp are
a bit confused, and don't know what
to make of their two gaits. Zam
perini's style looks the more spec
tacular because of his fast first and i
last laps—the last one amounting to [
a sprint with the runner getting up j
on his toes and digging in for the '
final 220 yards.
Paul's system is that of run
ning his laps more evenly, starting
out with a 59 or 60 first lap. and
gradually upping (hat so that from
(ine lap to the next he appears to
be going at the same speed. But if
you had watched the Moorc-Zam
perini battle in the medley relay
down at Fresno, you'd have no
ticed this:
Zamp lit out with a hefty 57-sec- |
ond first lap, while Paul loafed with
a 60-second, falling back so that he
had more than 30 yards to make up.
Zamp's easy, relaxed stride gave
him a 66-second second lap, and
Paul running at almost the same gait
as the first picked up yardage on
him.
The difference between their
third laps was especially notice
able, for Paul caught up with
Zamp at the start of the fourth,
running around 64 or 65, and mak
ing it a 3:09 three-quarters of a
mile. Everyone knows what hap
pened on that fourth lap, for
Zamp only beat Paul by inches in
what was a 62 last lap for both.

HILL ELLINGTON explains that
when Paul gets ready to really run
that mile in record-breaking time,
it'll be a case of Paul's running four
almost identical laps. His first two
would be about (50 and 62; the third
would be either (53 or 64; and the
last lap would be taken care of by
Moore's running the kind of last
lap he did against Zamp at Fresno.
If Paul were to use /amp's pare
set-up and run a fast 57 or 58 first
lap. he could still continue run a
good mile: but with that pace, you
can't talk about bis getting down
Ic. 1:06. which is around world rec
ord time. You have to under-

stand that Paul can't run that fast i
and have anything left in his third
and fourth laps to get down to
4:06.
Zamp, {is we've said, runs fast first
and last laps and eases vip on the
second and third rounds; that's
where the two runners are differ
ent.

Zamp lit out with a hefty 57-sec- |
ond first lap, while Paul loafed with
a 60-second, falling back so that he
had more than 30 yards to make up.
Zamp's easy, relaxed stride gave
him a 66-second second lap, and
Paul running at almost the same gait
as the first picked up yardage on
him.
The difference between their
third laps was especially notice
able, for Paul caught up with
Zamp at the start of the fourth,
running around 64 or 65, and mak
ing it a 3:09 three-quarters of a
mile. Everyone knows what hap
pened on that fourth lap, for
Zamp only beat Paul by inches in
what was a 62 last lap for both.

HILL ELLINGTON explains that
when Paul gets ready to really run
that mile in record-breaking time,
it'll be a case of Paul's running four
almost identical laps. His first two
would be about (50 and 62; the third
would be either (53 or 64; and the
last lap would be taken care of by
Moore's running the kind of last
lap he did against Zamp at Fresno.
If Paul were to use /amp's pare
set-up and run a fast 57 or 58 first
lap. he could still continue run a
good mile: but with that pace, you
can't talk about bis getting down
Ic. 1:06. which is around world rec
ord time. You have to under-

stand that Paul can't run that fast i
and have anything left in his third
and fourth laps to get down to
4:06.
Zamp, {is we've said, runs fast first
and last laps and eases vip on the
second and third rounds; that's
where the two runners are differ
ent.

writer, Dick Hyland, who wrote an j
article ia yesterday morning's Times
which makes him look stupid when
it comes to judging track perform

Now I don't say that I know j
more than Ilyland. but 1 do check [

feeling secure in the fact that he

about milers.
So he said: "It is evident, watch
ing that pair run, that Zamperini
knows much more about, their sport
than does Moore. The latter simply
gets out there and runs while Zam
perini knows what he is doing at all
times. . . . Louie it may be said
knows his game."
If nothing else does, the big race ,
between Paul Moore and Louie !
Zamperini will stack 'em in at the j
Coliseum Saturday, and all Coasl 1
track and field attendance records I
should be shattered.
From the week before Moore
tiimmed Zamperini's sails in the
Trojan meet, May 4, through this
week, there will be controversies
arising as to the merits of the two
runners. Those who've seen Moore
and Zamp in their four meetings
(twice at U.S.C., once in the Fresno
Relays, and once in last week's !
Finnish Relief) must realize by
this time that the two men are
two entirely different types of
runners.
Neither one runs the same pace
for the four laps . Those who've seen
Paul run and then watch Zamp are
a bit confused, and don't know what
to make of their two gaits. Zam
perini's style looks the more spec
tacular because of his fast first and i
last laps—the last one amounting to [
a sprint with the runner getting up j
on his toes and digging in for the '
final 220 yards.
Paul's system is that of run
ning his laps more evenly, starting
out with a 59 or 60 first lap. and
gradually upping (hat so that from
(ine lap to the next he appears to
be going at the same speed. But if
you had watched the Moorc-Zam
perini battle in the medley relay
down at Fresno, you'd have no
