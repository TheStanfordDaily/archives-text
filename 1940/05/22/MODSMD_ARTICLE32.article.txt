# Lincoln Hurts Tendon, Lost For P.C.C. Meet
## 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Tragedy struck again at Stan
ford's track team which is vainly
trying to keep all its performers
healthy and in one piece in order
to deliver beating number two to
U.S.C. in the coming Pacific Coast
Conference. Newest edition to
Coach Hill Ellington's list of point
winners who through injury will
not be able to compete this Fri
day and Saturday iÂ« Jim Lincoln.
"Line," who won the Eig Meet at
the near record height of 6 ft. 5 : ' ,f i
in., tore his Achilles tendon while
working out late Monday evening.
Not until yesterday was it apparent
that Lincoln's own flying spike had
done enough damage to keep him
from competition.
Already on the sidelines for the
ail-important conference affair are
Sid Hayes in the hurdles, Mush
Girard and Burman Skrable in the
distances.
JEFFREY UNCERTAIN
But the real question mark of a
Stanford victory over the mighty
Trojan horde is Captain Clyde Jef
frey. Jeit hasn't taken off the wraps
in the least bit as yet and today
caines the crucial test, for he plans
to apply the pressure this afternoon
in practice.
ll' Clyde's leg holds, showing" that
the muscle cramp that sent him
scurrying to the rest home for end
less heat treatments has healed, then
the Cards have more than a better
chance of nipping El Trojan for the
second time this year. For a healthy
Jeffrey means two sprint victories
for Stanford, and the meet is bound
to be close enough to make these 10
points all-important.
TROUT TOSSES 51 FEET
More on the bright side of things
were the performances of several
Cards in practice yesterday. Big Bill
Trout gave indications that he is
about ready to turn the tables on
both Herb Michaels of Cal and Don
McNeil of U.S.C., who took him
earlier in the year in dual competi
tion. The husky ex-footballer got a
total of 8 puts over 51 feet last night,
the farthest traveling 51 ft. 9 in.
Paul Moore and Ernie Clark both
worked for speed yesterday. With
Craig Williamson and Charlie Shaw
holding down the quarter mile to
satisfaction, Clark will probably join
Paul in the half.
In developing their speed these
two ran the shorter G(5O in mighty
fast time. Paul did 1:19 flat and
Ernie came up with a 1:19.5 race; the
great Ben Eastman's best was 1:19.7.
