# Gridders Adopt Backfield Shift
## 
### 
Stanford's spring gridders reached
a milestone in the Shaughnessy sys
tem in yesterday afternoon's open
drill on the varsity practice field.
Until this week the 1940 Big Red
squad has been running every play
from a "T" formation with a bal
anced line, the quarterback always
taking the ball from center. Yester
day the centers had to pass the ball
for the first time, with the elevens
running through plays from a single
wing-back with an unbalanced line
to the right or left.
The Indians will work out in pri
vate this afternoon. Only six more
practices remain before the squad
winds up spring training with the
first annual Football Field Day in
the Stadium June 1. The Field Day
taking the place of the spring intra
squad game, will be a "glorified prac
tice session."
