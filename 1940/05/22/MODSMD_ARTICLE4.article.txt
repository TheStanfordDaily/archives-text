# Row Abolishes Paddling, Modifies Old 'Hell Week'
## 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
Intel-fraternity Board of Control last night officially filed paddling and
hazing in its legislative wastcbasket.
In outlawing paddling and hazing and further shortening the Initiation
Period, formerly known as "Hell Week," the Board eliminated what have

long been considered by many as two<
of the greatest evils of the Stanford
fratei.'ity system.
NO PUBLIC SHOW
Included in. a 10-point Initiation
Period program are the new regu
lations:
"There shall be no hazing of neo
phytes."
An interpretation of this rule by
the Board pointed out that house
duties and pranks will be permitted
as long as there is no public disturb
ance. Fraternity men will be ex
pected to conduct themselves as "in
telligent university people."
"Adequate measures must be taken
to safeguard the health of the ini
tiates. This includes reasonable food,
six consecutive hours of night sleep
in every 24, and no unreasonable
physical" treatment. The latter in
cludes an outlawing of the paddle,
which is in accordance with the
A.SS.U. constitution."
Conmenting on the new rules, Bob
Moulton, retiring Interfraternity
Board of Control and Council presi
dent, said:
"I feel it is a desirable refinement
of a practice that has always been
ridiculous."
PADDLE REPLACED
Jack Ahern, ex-Beta president,
asked what threat will be used to
forc\ pledges to pledge duties, since
outlawing the paddle. It was pointed
out that either the levying of fines
or refusal to initiate pledges whose
work is incomplete would suffice.
Initiation Period was officially
shortened to last during the period
from Friday noon to 6 o'clock Sun
day evening. The other eight points
for Initiation Period will be in to
morrow's Daily.
The Board passed the recommen
dation of the Council that an addi
tional $55 be voted to the Interfra
ternity Magazine, and changed the
Council's recommendation for rush
ing periods for next season to in
clude 25 rush periods on 11 different
days.

"Adequate measures must be taken
to safeguard the health of the ini
tiates. This includes reasonable food,
six consecutive hours of night sleep

which is in accordance with the
A.SS.U. constitution."

Moulton, retiring Interfraternity
Board of Control and Council presi

of a practice that has always been
ridiculous."
PADDLE REPLACED
Jack Ahern, ex-Beta president,
asked what threat will be used to

shortened to last during the period

day evening. The other eight points
for Initiation Period will be in to
morrow's Daily.
The Board passed the recommen
dation of the Council that an addi

Period program are the new regu

pected to conduct themselves as "in
telligent university people."
