A I'PIIOXIMATKLY a year and a half ago, a live
' wire Stanford undergraduate got the idea that lie
could build tip a paying campus business by giving
away cardboard theater attractions. He called his
idea "The Informer" and got bis profits by selling
advertisements to go around the fringe of the movie
announcements.
Last night at an Kx Committee meeting this young
enterpriser and bis partner, now both seniors, were
granted a ''bonus' of fifty doliars apiece, to be paid
(»ul of next year's "Informer" profits. Excom was
rewarding them for having originated and perfected
.something lliat lias come to be recognized as a defi
nile service to most campus living groups. No other
publication has complained because this new ad
vertising medium has been hampering their sales
staffs. Most of them, in fact, insist that such an idea,
which contributes to the campus welfare consistently
and inexpensively, has had no effect «>ll their indi
\ idual inches of space sold.
Ex Committee, in making the grant last night,
naturally is going to be the target of a few die-hards
who will claim that every crack-pot with a sales idea
will now come around for a little of this new and
thick gravy. But these crack-pots, offering nothing
which is not already provided for by the present
publications, and more often than not imperiling
Stanford's advertising market, can and will be
turned down without much ado. Neither Publica
tions Council nor Kxcom has announced any inten
tion of throwing the fertile campus market wide
open. "The Informer merely happened to be the
best idea brought forward in a decade and did no
harm either to ihe available market or to the sales
department of the other publications.
One thing, however, must be noted here and that
is the fact thai Kxcom and Publications Council alike
will refuse tc sanction any private sale by students
of the rights to a particularly lucrative advertising
field. I bey were willing enough to grant a bonus
for lh<> creation of and the initial work on an ap
proved plan. Bui they have and will draw the line
on any attempts of one group to sell their "rights"
to a succeeding group.
Stanford is a closed market. Those who handle
Stanford s publications therefore are mere agents
being offered a chance to earn a decent student liv
ing in an extra susceptible market. As privileged
agents, then, they cannot rightfully claim any extra
resale dividends.
Ih.it there is a difference between resale privileges
and bonuses for exceptional work rendered. The
originators of "The Informer have proven that
Ihev are worthy of a reward for merit.
