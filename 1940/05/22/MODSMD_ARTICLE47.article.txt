# CAMPUS OPINION
## THE 						CASE HAS TWO SIDES 
### 
r JPHE EDITOR, SIR:
It is our opinion that the assumption that a Ger
man victory would be an international catastrophe is
entirely erroneous. On the contrary we feel that such
a victory would be of greater benefit to humanity
than an Allied triumph.
Modern history shows us that the major cause of
European discords has been nationalism and a lack
of unity. It is obvious that previous Allied victories
have failed to accomplish a lasting peace in Europe.
A victory for Germany would insure a united Europe,
perhaps not a United States of Europe immediately
but such a system would eventually result, and per
haps eventually lead to a world-wide federation mod
eled after the United States. Totalitarianism, so long
abhorent to lovers of Democracy, would cease to be
an important factor since once Germany has accom
plished her destiny she would no longer need that
type of organization, for it was designed to foster
German nationalism and marshal full strength for the
present struggle.
From an economic viewpoint the United States
would actually benefit from a German victory, through
increased foreign trade brought about by greater Euro
pean dependence on U. S. goods, participation in the
rehabilitation of France, and the development of the
African Continent by Germany with the aid of U. S.
capital. Foreign trade would be greatly facilitated by
a united Europe through the elimination of national
istic policies of trade restriction.
Thus we have come to the conclusion that the
United States can best aid her own interests by help
ing Germany, which in turn can only be done by main
taining a policy of strict neutrality.
