### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
OLD MAN RIBBAH
DY far the greatest attraction at the Curran's "Show
Boat" is a six-foot-four, 230-pound black giant
with a voice like relaxed and melodious thunder. Paul
Robeson is the highest example of his race—intelli
gent, physically powerful, and with a great easy-going
reserve. The audience literally holds up the show with
applause and encores when he sings the song he has
made so famous that he is tired of it—"Old Man
Ribbah."
Robeson, like many other negro entertainers, may
have been frightened and appalled the first time he
looked out on a mass of intent white faces. He must
feel peculiar every time he sees all those white faces
smile back at his face-wide colored grin, as he hears
the white hands clap for him. He must feel peculiar
as he hears the ovation and remembers that no mat
ter how far above the great mass of humanity he has
risen, no matter what degree of excellence he has
achieved, the white people who cheer for his singing
scorn his color and think of him as a member of an
inferior race.
He probably felt the same way when he was a
student at Rutgers and won almost every laurel that a
respected college man can win. When he was awarded
a Phi Beta Kappa key, perhaps he wondered how
people could judge negroes as a group, as an intellec
tually inferior group. And when he starred on the
gridiron and became an Ail-American football player,
perhaps he wondered why he was still not the equal
of comparable white men.

TMPARTIAL genes inadvertently played an ironic
trick on him. They gave him the gifts of an intel
lectual and physical king, and they gave him a color
for which men rob him of social acceptance.
Paul Robeson, being sensitively intelligent and be
ing black, must wonder sometimes how and when a
universal brotherhood of man will actually be achieved.
He must see that the only true aristocracy is a demo
cratic one—the aristocracy of ability and character.
But I don't imagine he worries about it too much. He
probably thinks about it, but with a powerful sense of
security within himself and with a tolerant flexibility
that is characteristic of so many negroes.
But few people at the Curran Theater think about
those things. They just listen to the great voice and
watch the plaving of a famous negro prototype.
And the dreams that Robeson may wonder about
are probably not possible, and certainly far away.
Meanwhile the great black giant sings and thinks. And
the best thing about his position is that he is not only
more intelligent than most of his audience, but can
probably stand apart with more independence, and
more peace.
