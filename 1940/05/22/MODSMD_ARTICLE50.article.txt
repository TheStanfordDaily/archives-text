# THE
						SHORT VIEW

r more frequently you attend lectures, the more
assignments that you read, and the more answers
that you recite, the more you realize that lectures, as
signments and answers do not make a college educa
tion. They make lecture notes, second hand books, and
marks in grade books. Unfortunately, these things are
not interchangeable with an education.
It took Henry Adams a lifetime to find that out,
and by that time all he could do was to write a very
sad and philosophical book about it. The sooner peo
ple who are interred in American colleges for four
years' worth of education, and make it tender if you
please, find it out for themselves, the sooner colleges
can fulfill the purposes for which they were founded.
Sometimes students find it out by l-eading a book like
"The Education of Henry Adams"; sometimes they
find it out bv sitting in on a country store session of
cracker barrel economics; sometimes they find it out
listening to the Glee Club sing on the steps of Dart
mouth Hall; sometimes they find it out by an empty
feeling they get when they look at. a stacked accumu
lation of lecture notes and then read the daily papers
or glance over the Help Wanted columns or think
about their lives supposedly meaning something.

HPHE missing factor has been called integration. It has
also been called escaping from the ivory tower.
It is foolish to try to call it anything in particular, but
it is recognizable in an incentive to read and talk
everything in together, to go out and shake bands with
the sky and meet the population of the world, to look
for things that need knowing instead of engraving
mental phonograph records that will play back con
veniently.
The drive that makes college into education is vague
and elusive and exacting once it's caught; but it's pretty
important if the money spent oi/four years of college
are to pay for more than board, room, and fun. It
won't earn dollars after diploma day. Training and
apprenticeships are supposedly to help you earn money.
Education is supposedly to help you live.
