# Robeson's Singing Makes 'Showboat' Worthwhile
## 
### 
"SHOWBOAT," now playing at
the Curran Theater in San Fran
cisco.
No matter what you have to pay
for tickets, this play is worth the
money. But it's worth it for just
one reason. All-together-now, kid
dies—Paul Robeson.
You'll have to endure a lot of
painful moments and a lot of drowsy
ones between Robeson appearances.
Sometimes you'll think you can't
stand it any longer; but then the
huge black man with the infectious
smile will shuffle onto the stage and
let go with "Ole Man River" or "Still
Suits Me."
And that effortless haunting voice
will roll out across the footlights
right down into your insides. I
guarantee that, after you quit shak
ing, and your palms stop stinging,
you'll know that no matter what the
price in cash, ennui, and exhaustion,
it's worth it.
REST OF CAST FAILS
Always excepting Robeson, there's
little excuse for the Curran produc
tion. It'll nearly break your heart,
too, because, in spite of all the efforts
of the cast, it still gives evidence of
being the great American musical
classic it has been hailed as time and
time again.
The songs—'"Make Believe," "Can't
Help Lovin' That Man," "Ole Man
River," "You Are Love," "Bill,"
"Why Do I Love You," "Ah Still
Suits Me." and the rest, not so fam
ous, but equally tuneful, are all
there. And it makes you unhappy
that some of them are.
HEROINE TOO OLD
On the program and bill boards,
the cast looks as though it couldn't
be better. All are big names, fam
ous in the musical world. It took
time to build them up, and it's time
that's making all the trouble. John
Boles can still act, but he just can't
sing.
Norma Terris, of the original cast,
was probably very young and pretty
then. Now she looks foolish in the
hair-ribbons and pantalettes of 17-

year-old Magnolia. Her voice is too
mature and it has an unpleasant
piercing quality.
Guy Kibbee's Captain Andy was
uninspired, and Ava Josette's too
soft-spoken Julie had the wrong
kind of voice for her haunting blues
songs. Helen Lynd and Sammy
White took rather heavy-handed care
of the comedy.
But Robeson's there. That's all
that really matters. —Nowell

HEROINE TOO OLD
On the program and bill boards,
the cast looks as though it couldn't
be better. All are big names, fam
ous in the musical world. It took
time to build them up, and it's time
that's making all the trouble. John
Boles can still act, but he just can't
sing.
Norma Terris, of the original cast,
was probably very young and pretty
then. Now she looks foolish in the
hair-ribbons and pantalettes of 17-

year-old Magnolia. Her voice is too
mature and it has an unpleasant
piercing quality.
Guy Kibbee's Captain Andy was
uninspired, and Ava Josette's too
soft-spoken Julie had the wrong
kind of voice for her haunting blues
songs. Helen Lynd and Sammy
White took rather heavy-handed care
of the comedy.
But Robeson's there. That's all
that really matters. —Nowell
"SHOWBOAT," now playing at
the Curran Theater in San Fran
cisco.
No matter what you have to pay
for tickets, this play is worth the
money. But it's worth it for just
one reason. All-together-now, kid
dies—Paul Robeson.
You'll have to endure a lot of
painful moments and a lot of drowsy
ones between Robeson appearances.
Sometimes you'll think you can't
stand it any longer; but then the
huge black man with the infectious
smile will shuffle onto the stage and
let go with "Ole Man River" or "Still
Suits Me."
And that effortless haunting voice
will roll out across the footlights
right down into your insides. I
guarantee that, after you quit shak
ing, and your palms stop stinging,
you'll know that no matter what the
price in cash, ennui, and exhaustion,
it's worth it.
REST OF CAST FAILS
Always excepting Robeson, there's
little excuse for the Curran produc
tion. It'll nearly break your heart,
too, because, in spite of all the efforts
of the cast, it still gives evidence of
being the great American musical
classic it has been hailed as time and
time again.
The songs—'"Make Believe," "Can't
Help Lovin' That Man," "Ole Man
River," "You Are Love," "Bill,"
"Why Do I Love You," "Ah Still
Suits Me." and the rest, not so fam
ous, but equally tuneful, are all
there. And it makes you unhappy
that some of them are.
