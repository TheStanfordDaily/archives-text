# German Mechanized Divisions Reach Channel; Nazi Bombers Sweep Over England's Seacoast
## Hitler's Air Fury Lashes at England; Duff-Cooper Admits Nazi Victories, But Says Allies Will Fight Back 
### 
LONDON, Wednesday, May 22 (UP). — German planes
bombed southeast England last night, it was announced offi
cially.
The announcement was made by the Air Ministry and the

Ministry for Home Security.
The communique said:
"Enemy aircraft jettisoned ♦
bombs on two districts of south
cast England last night. Some of 1
the bombs fell on land and others
into the sea. Anti-aircraft guns 1
were in action. There were no j
casualties and no damage was re
ported."
LONDON, May 21 (UP). —The'
government warned the British peo- J
pie by radio tonight to be prepared
tor a German invasion at any time
because Adolf Hitler's war machine j
is "coming near its objective"—ter- I
l orizing war against the British Isles. 1
Minister of Information Alfred <
Duff-Cooper said in a radio talk j
describing the "gravity" of the hour j
that Nazi mechanized troops have !
struck across northern France with |
amazing speed upon the French i
Channel ports.
FEAR ATTACK
The British people worked franti- ,
cally to defend themselves against ;
what threatens to be the first inva- !
sion of England in 874 years—a Ger- 1
man blitzkrieg through the air across |
the scant 65 miles of water separating j
j the English east coast from France, j
Duff-Cooper, in his radio speech j
which was heard in the United
States, recalled he had told the Brit
ish people to be "prepared for bad
news" and to "meet it bravely as our
tioops are meeting the enemy's at
tacks."
The British and French troops still
are on the battlefields, he said, arc
standing their ground without re
treating and have not suffered heavy
losses. It is only that small Nazi
mechanized forces have succeeded
in "eluding" the Allies and striking
toward the coast over a thin and
I insecure line of communications, he
I claimed.
| SEES ALLIED DRIVE
When the Allied counter-offensive
comes, as it will, it will be a for
midable one, he contended.
Britons realized tonight, with Ger
many at or near the French Channel
ports, Ihe shadow of an invader is
closer to England than at any time
since Napoleon massed his cohorts at
Boulogne in 1805.
But Napoleon himself never drew
any such united effort of resistance
as the British arc making to meet
Hitler's threat from the skies.
Boys of 17 and World War veter
ans of (>0 enrolled by the thousands
as "minute men" answering the gov
ernment's call for 500,000 riflemen to
battle any parachutist invaders.
Government buildings are heavily
sand - bagged and cordoned with
barbed wire, railroads and power
plants arc heavily guarded and thou
sands of aliens have been seized
and interned.
The average Briton still doesn't
know how near the danger actually
is because late afternoon newspapers
all gave their biggest headlines to
accounts of Allied "successes."
