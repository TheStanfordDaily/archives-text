### WILSON CANNON 
VOU can lead an elephant to the
ballot box, but you can't make
him say "uncle."
G. O. P. spokesman Alf Landon
yesterday warned that Republican
leaders will join Roosevelt's proposed
"coalition cabinet" only if the Presi
dent eliminates himself as a third
term candidate.
Mr. Roosevelt flatly rejected the I
proposal.
It was Ihe first direct reply j
made publicly by the President to
pressure from national politicos
that he announce his plans for 1940.
The statement tended to substan
tiate reports that no declaration
will be made from the White
House until shortly before the
Democratic convention in June.
Democrats interpreted the state
ment as a formal rebuke to Repub
licans for being unwilling to shelve
political considerations at a time
when national safety transcends
other issues.
Republicans saw in his refusal a
reluctance to give up what would
prove the greatest political coup of
the day Should Roosevelt complete
such a coalition cabinet, they said,
it would mean only one thing . . .
that he would give way to no man
for 1940.
Landon keynoted G.O.P. reluct
ance with no mincing of words. He
conceded that world situations had
serious implications for America.
But he warned that personnel of a
defense cabinet should not be
"merely administration satellites."
* *
ww JJNFORTUNATELY for the
country," he said, "the lead
ership is in the hands of a man who
has not eliminated himself as a
candidate for an indefinite term as
President.
"Any Republican leader who
takes a position in the present set
up from the standpoint of unselfish
national service is making himself a
party to this third or indefinite term
move."
The patter of G.O.P. applause re
sounded in the background.
Intimation that Roosevelt might
be attempting to stretch his party
leadership to include the entire na
tion was threaded through the Lan
don comments.
Background of the political sal
vos was a recent proposal from the
White House that Republicans and
Democrats join hands in a na
tionally represented cabinet which
would guide America through the
web of present international diffi
culties.
Creation of a national council to
guide this country's actions during
World War II was Roosevelt's pur
ported reason for the move.
Surprise last-word in the battle of
accusations was held by politically
intuitive Mr. Roosevelt.
"I am grateful for the suggestions
contained in Mr. Landon's press
statements," he said in effect. "Un
fortunately none of the subjects
mentioned by him were discussed in
our conference today.
"But I am very grateful for the
visit."
yy/HILE national back-sticking
four»d itself into America's
front, pages, Europe's blitzkrieg war
continued with Der Fuehrer's forces
still relatively unstoppable.
Utter confusion enveloped the
armies staging a dozen furious bat
tles in northern France. So topsy
turvy was the action tnac official
spokesmen of both factions admitted
their inability to supply real infor
mation on the melee.
Roth prongs of the German
spearhead appeared to he closing
in on the Allied army fighting with
backs to the English Channel.
Nazi quarters implied that only
total surrender could save the
1,000,000 troops caught in the Ger
man "iron circle."
Allied reports, emanating largely
from London, were only slightly less
assured in tone than German claims.
Calling the German "finger" which
touches the channel a perfect set-up
for simultaneous Allied flank at
tacks, British circles hinted that the
next few days may sec an Allied
drive sweep German forces from
their channel gains.
