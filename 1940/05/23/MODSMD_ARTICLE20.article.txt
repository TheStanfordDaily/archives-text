# Trustees Decide to Add $15 to Stanford Tuition, Effective Fall Quarter
## Change Will Apply to All Students; $30,000 Set Aside in Scholarships To Make Up for Raise, B.A.C. Loss 
### 
Stanford tuition will be raised $15 per quarter for all students register
ing in the University for the academic year beginning September 1, 1940,
it was decided by the Board of Trustees in a special meeting held .yesterday
afternoon.
To compensate somewhat for the raise and also to (ill the hole left by
ihe removal of B.A.C. funds from student aid, the Board set aside npproxi-

$30,000 for grants in aid and
scholarships.
The raise places tuition now at $115
per quarter plus the regular $15 com
munity fee, with the present syllabus
and laboratory fees still in effect.
Tuition notes for needy students up
to the full amount of the tuition are
to be allowed under the usual rules.
BLAMES INTEREST RATES
"While Stanford University had
been able to avoid a deficit up to the
present year," President Ray Ry
man Wilbur stated last night, "con
ditions over which the University
has had no control, such as declining
interest rates, defaults in bonds and
increasing costs, will cause a deficit
for the current academic year and a
larger one for the year 1940-41.
"The fundamental difficulty is that
the University endowment is bring
ing in about a quarter of a million
dollars less income than before and
there is no immediate likelihood of
an improvement."
The additional amount of income
coming to the University from this
increase will not meet the deficit
which Stanford is facing if the pres
ent conditions continue, and it i.s
probable that a further increase of
an approximate similar amount will
be required for all students for the
academic year beginning September
1, 1941, according to the board.
WAS BELOW AVERAGE
Stanford's tuition before the in
crease was $112 per year below the
average charged by seven Eastern
and Mid-Western universities of
equal scholastic caliber.
The sampling of tuition figures for
the universities of Chicago, Colum
bia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard,
Princeton and Yale showed that
their tuitions ranged from $300 to
$510. The average of these institu
tions was $412 for the academic year.
Stanford's productive endowment
is $30,100,000, which averages $6,597
per student, while the average for
the seven above institutions is $66,-
500,000, which amounts to $10,499
per student. The Stanford endow
ment thus is approximately $4,000
per student below comparable uni
versities.
