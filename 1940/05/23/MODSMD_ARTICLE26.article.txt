# Zurich Scans Passing Events To Study Public
## Stanford Professor Writes News Test For Time Magazine 
### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
Armies march, unions strike, books
are written, discoveries are made—
all a pari of this dynamic world.
And in an office of tht Education
Building, Dr. Alvin C. Eurich care
fully observes these events, weighs
their importance, and draws up a
list of questions. Time magazine
shortly aftgr publishes a current
events test—resulting from this work
of Dr. Eurich and his collaborator,
Elmo C. Wilson, of the University ol
Minnesota.
But it is not just reading a news
paper and dashing oir some ques
tions. Extensive studies in schools
and universities are conducted to
test the questions—the wrong an
swers must be plausible. "If the cor
rect answer is so obvious that a
person doesn't have to discriminate,
the item is no good," Dr. Eurich
explains.
CAMPUS TO BE TESTED
Classes on the campus are taking
the current events test prepared for
publication in about two weeks, but
it will have to be revised. It con
tains questions speculating on the
possibilities of invasions of the
Netherlands and Belgium.
"In the six years I have been
working on these tests for Time not
so many things have happened in so
short a time," Dr. Eurich remarked.
"Last fall we drew up a summer re
view test just before the war broke
out, but then the whole thing had
to be scrapped."
To make the tests as timely as
possible, questions on last-minute
events are telegraphed even to the
printers.
TO STIMULATE INTEREST
The test is distributed to schools
throughout the cofmtry before it is
published and statistics are care
fully compiled from the answers.
The purpose of the test is to stimu
late interest in contemporary affairs
among students, as well as among the
readers of Time magazine.
Questions are asked on national
and foreign affairs, business, science,
art, music, picture and map identi
fication.
Dr. Eurich, education professor at
Stanford for the last two years, is
also the co-author of the Co-opera
tive Contemporary Affairs Test pub
lished for the American Council on
Education. This test is for college
sophomores to measure interests as
well as knowledge of current affairs.
