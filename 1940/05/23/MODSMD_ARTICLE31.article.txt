### 
A money-rich, consumption-poor
country had better take steps to cor
rect its economic lag or face eco
nomic chaos, suggested Professor
Harold Chapman Brown at the
weekly Lunch Club meeting yester
day noon.
Professor Brown, head of the
Stanford Department of Philosophy,
reminded the listeners that one
third of America is still '"ill fed. ill
clad, and ill housed." The lowest
one-third of American income
groups exists on under $700 a year,
Professor Brown showed from U. S.
government statistics.
The breakdown on these income
figures for the lowest income group
allows $1.60 a week for food per
person, or 5 cents a meal. The next
income group, or what is called the
middle class, averages $2.40 a week
per person for food, and the highest
income group spends $6 a week per
person for food, said Professor
Brown.
