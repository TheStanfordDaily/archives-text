ABOUT TOWN
There are going to be many anx
ious moments between now and
Sunday night for seven golfers, be
muse at that time Coach Eddie
Twiggs will give the B.A.C. his
choice of six men to make the trip
east, June 15, for the National Col
legiate championships.
For a time last month the golf
ers were afraid that none of them
would make the trip to (be his
toric Ekwanok Links, Manchester,
\ (.. but the B.A.C. finally saw its
way clear to appropriate something
like $1000 to send them back with
Eddie.
Two of these seven men would
like to make this trek for Ihe one
reason that they are seniors. Don
Kennedy, No. 2 man, already is defi
nitely assured the trip, but Jack
Showalter and Dick Wright are on
the border and may be forced to give
way lo the numerous juniors on the
squad.
Warren Berl has been on the
traveling list a long time, because
no one has even threatened his
No. 1 playing position all year. But
I'd hate to be in Wright's. Gordon
Hough's, Sherm Selix's, Don Ilas
lett s, Hal Stone's, George Brad-
It \ s, or Showalter's shoes, waiting
for Eddie's announcement that will
send six on their way for at least
three weeks in the East.
Next year's team should be even
more formidable, with only three j
graduating and three or four good ;
freshmen taking their places. Greg
Kelley and Bill Wagstaf? have the
best chance of playing regularly next
spring but Dave Doud and Roger'
Hurd will be making their bids and
might surprise. Berl's No. 1 posi
tion seems to be out of shooting dis
tance of the other men, but the other
posts will be wide open.

NEXT YEAR'S HOSTS to the '
N.C.2A. will be Ohio State College's
fine links, and it will be the first ;
time that a private course has not
been the site of the championships.
The year following, Stanford's own
course has been suggested, and in all
probability it will take care of the
1942 play.
On the Pacific Coast, (he Uni
versity links has been generally
recognized as one of the most pic
(uresque as well as hazardous
courses. It is extremely well
trapped, having about 55 hunkers
•strategically located.
About, nine of the holes are dog
legs and about the same number

i have San Francisquito Creek as part
I of their outline or part of their
water hazard.
Perhaps students don't realize
that there is quite a bit to the up
keep of this course and that there
is quite a bit they can do to help
E. W. Van Gorder, course super
intendent. and his crew. He men
tioned that players are careless in
replacing divots, and that they fail
to rake the traps after they have
whacked away at (lie sand trying
to dislodge a ball.

JIM LINCOLN is the most, recent
casualty on Bill Elilngton's track
squad. He hurt his jumping or left
foot Monday night in practice when
j his spikes tore his Achilles tendon.
The seriousness wasn't realized
until Tuesday when he was de
clared out. He might be out for
good, because his spikes did
enough damage to that tendon to
possibly affect next year's jump
ing.
Dr. Fritz Roth had to use wire to
I put this track man's tendon together.
He used silver wire to draw the sev
ered muscles in Mushy Girard's leg
together. At the same time, Jim has
' to worry about blood poisoning be
cause he got enough sawdust into
i the wound to make that possible.
Lincoln was being counted on to
bring Stanford a third in (he high
jump Saturday, and now it'll he up
(o Russ WulfT to break up the Tro
jan jumping monopoly.
The wind at the North Pole al
ways blows from the south.
