# Jeff's Leg Looks Good For P.C.C.
## 
### 
A heavy wind kepi most varsity
trackmcn anchored during yester
day's practice but the perform -
; ance of one single Card runner
was enough to brighten the heart
of Coach Bill Ellington and
strengthen Indian hopes for their
first Pacific Coast Conference vic
tory since the meet was revised in
1937.
The runner, ,a sprinter to be ex
| act, was none other than Stanford's
; track captain, Clyde Jeffrey, fastest
while man in the world. Captain Jeff
gingerly tested with no ill effects his
j leg which suffered a muscle cramp
I in the Fresno Relays.
BACK IN FORM
Though Clyde didn't let out all the
| way he was approaching full steam
and looked his old self. Now that his
leg is physically fit, it is only a mat
j ier of mental attitude for Clyde and
| that shouldn't be hard for he hasn't
J been beaten this year.
Though tough competition which
; will include Jack Ernigh of Montana,
j Lee Orr of Washington State, Hal
| Sinclair of U.C.L.A., and Mickey An-
I derson of U.S.C. will face Captain
| Jeff, the Card sprinter is capable of
j two sprint victories which will put
; him and his 17 teammates well on
| their way to a victory.
j TRIALS TOMORROW
Ellington is sending south as
I many men as can be entered in the
j meet; this is a total of 18. The
' squad heads for Los Angeles tonight
and some of its performers will
| have trials tomorrow. Their coach
j heads south this morning to be in on
the lane drawing activities for the
trials.
This year the Indians have their
stiongest chance since the Confer
ence meet was reborn in 1937 to
j take the mighty Trojans. In '37, '38,
j and '39 U.S.C. has won and Stanford
| has finished in second posiiion. A
victory this year over the Trojans
will be doubly pleasant for it will
j further Farm claims for the greatest
; track team in the country by giving
| Stanford a two-to-one margin over
i U.S.C. in meets this year.

J Coast Conference meet are Clyde
