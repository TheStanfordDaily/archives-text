# Card Gridders Mix New, Old Formations in Secret Practice
## 
### 
Stanford's spring grid squad tried
: out their new formation in yester
day afternoon's secret practice. The
first and second teams, scrimmag
ing against the fifth string, mixed a
I plentiful supply of single wing b;ick
j plays in with the regular T-forma-
I tion stuff that they've been using
j since the spring drills started.
! The squad has learned several
I routine running plays and a few
j passes that start from the set-up
Coach Clark Shaughnessy gave the
squad in Tuesday's open session.
The "A"' team lined up with Fred
die Meyer and Stan Graff at ends,
Swede Johansen and Carl Wernecke
at guards, Chick Orme and Johnny
Kerman at guards and Doug Stahle
at. center. The regular backfield of
Frankie Albert, Pete Kmetovic,
Norm Standiee, and Hugh Gallarneau
functioned behind this line.
The second string ran with Hank
Norberg and Ed Stamm at ends,
Bruno Banducci and Chuck Taylor
at tackles, Ken Robesky and Pop
Barnard at guards, and Colin Mc-
Clintock at center. "Crunch" Crane

at quarter, Milt Vucinich at full, and j
Johnny Casey and A1 Cole at halves
were in the beekfield. Ray Hammet,
freshman passer de luxe, traded off
with Cole.
Bill Willard, last fall's hard luck
kid. was out in a gym suit to limber
up his bum knee. An operation per
formed a few weeks ago seems to
have erased the old trouble, and the
big end is confident he'll be ready to
I go next fall.
