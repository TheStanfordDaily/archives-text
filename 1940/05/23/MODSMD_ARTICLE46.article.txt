Phi Beta Kappa national honorary scholastic
fraternity. lias elected seventv-one Stanford stu
dents to its membership. To most of these seventy-
one this represents the successful culmination of
four years of back-breaking grind.
Many who came to the University, came with the
obsession that not to become a Phi Beta Kappa is
to waste their four years. And in working toward
llns cud these students lost sight of the social ad
vantages of an institution such as Stanford — the
close friendship of the campus, the contact with
other people and their ideas, and the myriad of
activities that never cease. All of these things are
lost to them.
Contrasting themselves with this first section are
those students who emerge from under their desk
lamps to see the light of the sun over Lagunita, who
mix with their fellow classmates, and who take part
in that myriad of activities, giving a little in return
for all Stanford gives to them.
Such Phi Betes are those who hold top honors in
the class while serving as student representative on
the Union Board of Governors or being varsity track
stars, or those who serve as student body president
or obtain Block "S" sweaters in soccer; or those
who head Rally Committee, service on Women's
Council, or belong to Cap and Gown.
These are the people who really have the true
spirit of Phi Beta Kappa. They are the well-rounded
ones who hold first place on the chapter rolls and
who ultimately receive the greatest benefit, because
lli.it key onlv another si«jn of their accomplish
ments — their "drive." — G. H.
