## SIGN MY QUAD 
### 
r rHE EDITOR, SIH:
rherc is an old high school custom which I greatly
enjoyed and the fruits of which have given me a great
deal of pleasure in my college years, the signing of
liitjh school yearbooks. The other night I was going
through one of these high school annuals and reading
what my friends, who are now scattered throughout
the U. S.. had said about me.
Many of the letters and sayings scribbled on the
pages of the book were silly, meaningless; but in some
of them I detected an element of seriousness. They all
gave me pleasure to read and added to my memory
of happy high school days.
Why don't we have this custom in college, at Stan- )
ford? Are we too sophisticated, afraid to let down I

social barriers and du things that might be considered
high-schoolish; but that will in later years give us a
great deal of pleasure when our veneer of social habit
has worn off?
I m lor having my Quad signed this May. How
about you?
