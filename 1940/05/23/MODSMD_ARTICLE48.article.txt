# SPARE THE YOUNG
## 
### 
r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
We would not withhold a word of admiration for
"A Farm Boy's" letter in Monday's Daily. It is writ
ten so entirely in the spirit of Stanford as we know
our farm and as we would have it. Some of us who
have been perennially troubled about the destruction
of the swallows' homes, the distraught parent birds
and the dead fledglings on the ground when we arrive
on the campus on spring mornings and find the air
filled with the cries of distress, have for the first time
this year kept silent, subdued as we all are by the
overwhelming nature of the destruction being wrought
in human life in a world at war. Relatively, as farm
boy says, the killing of a few hundred birds and their
homes is of little importance. Nevertheless, the ruth
less method of routing the birds after they have built
their nests and partly raised their young is certainly
not of the essence of Stanford.
No less a person than David Starr Jordan believed
that human beings could be educated away from trying
to solve their economic and racial problems by war,
which in the final analysis turns out to be mainly
slaughter of the young. Certainly one step in that
education is to educate away from even the lesser
cruelties. For that reason we are glad for Farm Boy's
opinion.
