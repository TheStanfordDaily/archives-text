### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
NOBLE FIVE HUNDRED
STANFORD traditions have been getting a little
k aeration and shaking up lately. First there was the
avalanche of Quad smokers, sneaking around like so
many fifth-columnists and blowing their noxious nico
tine into the pure air over the Quadrangle. And then
there was the reaction to smoking on the Quad, and
Back to the Farm Week, and the bogging down of the
Convalescent Home Drive. And lately there has come
to undermine our heritage bobby-sock-wearing wom
en, shamelessly running around the Quad with bare
legs and, in some cases worse, bare faces.
But all these threats to the old Stanford, and these
self-satirizing movements to protect the old Stanford,
are mere shadows compared to the revolutionary doom
that lurks in the minds of Stanford's undergraduate
student body. Most of them want to reduce the already
dwindled ratio of Stanford men to Stanford women.
This tragic indication gleaned from the recent Daily
poll has, it is true, a number of promising features.
With as many women as men on the Farm, the petti
coat aristocracy would be delightfully challenged. No
longer would the sophisticated Stanford woman be
able to hold out for what, where, and when she pleased.
No longer would jolly-ups be a place where women
may picture themselves as sultanesses of a male harem.
And no longer would cautious smoothies have to get
dates two weeks in advance.
* * * *
B" T Stanford would pay for its new-found mascu
line emancipation. The Stanford rough, already
badly damaged by the influx of women transfers and
by Phelps-Terkel, would be killed and buried. Gab
ardines and whip cords would be worn to the funeral,
and thieving barber shops would be encouraged to
solicit for dandruff-removing shampoos. Women would
probably invade the 8.A.C., and the fluid fellowship
of the Stanford man would vanish.
Most women do not come to college for much be
sides a husband. And it must be admitted that half a
campus of husband-hunters will not do a great deal
for Stanford's reputation as a university of high de
gree. And think of it! Women's Council would rule
half the campus. How can we survive as a healthy
democracy if a bobby-sock government is to expand
its power?
So before we ask that the immigration bars be low
ered. before we surrender the numerical superiority
of the Stanford man, we had better take stock of wom
anly influences. It isn't pleasant to feel the chilly
security of a minority-basking female population. And
it isn't conducive to normalcy to ask for a date before
you want it. But the question is, do we want to
change those things badly enough to make this no
longer a man's world? Take a look at Stanford women
today, men. And ask yourselves, do you want more
of them?

campus of husband-hunters will not do a great deal
for Stanford's reputation as a university of high de
gree. And think of it! Women's Council would rule
half the campus. How can we survive as a healthy
democracy if a bobby-sock government is to expand
its power?
So before we ask that the immigration bars be low
ered. before we surrender the numerical superiority
of the Stanford man, we had better take stock of wom
anly influences. It isn't pleasant to feel the chilly
security of a minority-basking female population. And
it isn't conducive to normalcy to ask for a date before
you want it. But the question is, do we want to
change those things badly enough to make this no
longer a man's world? Take a look at Stanford women
today, men. And ask yourselves, do you want more
of them?
NOBLE FIVE HUNDRED
STANFORD traditions have been getting a little
k aeration and shaking up lately. First there was the
avalanche of Quad smokers, sneaking around like so
many fifth-columnists and blowing their noxious nico
tine into the pure air over the Quadrangle. And then
there was the reaction to smoking on the Quad, and
Back to the Farm Week, and the bogging down of the
Convalescent Home Drive. And lately there has come
to undermine our heritage bobby-sock-wearing wom
en, shamelessly running around the Quad with bare
legs and, in some cases worse, bare faces.
But all these threats to the old Stanford, and these
self-satirizing movements to protect the old Stanford,
are mere shadows compared to the revolutionary doom
that lurks in the minds of Stanford's undergraduate
student body. Most of them want to reduce the already
dwindled ratio of Stanford men to Stanford women.
This tragic indication gleaned from the recent Daily
poll has, it is true, a number of promising features.
With as many women as men on the Farm, the petti
coat aristocracy would be delightfully challenged. No
longer would the sophisticated Stanford woman be
able to hold out for what, where, and when she pleased.
No longer would jolly-ups be a place where women
may picture themselves as sultanesses of a male harem.
And no longer would cautious smoothies have to get
dates two weeks in advance.

B" T Stanford would pay for its new-found mascu
line emancipation. The Stanford rough, already
badly damaged by the influx of women transfers and
by Phelps-Terkel, would be killed and buried. Gab
ardines and whip cords would be worn to the funeral,
and thieving barber shops would be encouraged to
solicit for dandruff-removing shampoos. Women would
probably invade the 8.A.C., and the fluid fellowship
of the Stanford man would vanish.
Most women do not come to college for much be
sides a husband. And it must be admitted that half a
