freedom in this country is threatened
from two sources: the plutocracy, and the churches,
which endeavor between them to establish an eco
nomic and a theological censorship. The two are easily
combined by the accusation of communism, which is
recklessly hurled against anyone whose opinions are
disliked.
* * * *
No man can pass as educated who has heard only
one side on questions as to which the public is divided.
One of the most important things to teach in the edu
cational establishments of a democracy is the power
of weighing arguments, and the open mind which is
prepared in advance to accept whichever side appears
the more reasonable. As soon as a censorship is im
posed upon the opinions which teachers may avow,
education ceases to serve this purpose and tends to
produce, instead of a nation of men, a herd of fanatical
bigots.

r |' , AXPAYERS think that since they pay the salaries
of university teachers they have a right to decide
what these men shall teach. This principle, if logically
carried out, would mean that all the advantages of
superior education enjoyed by university professors
are to be nullified, and that their teaching is to be
the same as it would be if they have no special com
petence. . . . The exercise of power is agreeable, cspe- j
eially when it is an obscure individual who exercises ;
power over a prominent one. The Roman soldier who 1
killed Archimedes, if in his youth he had been com- j
pelled to study geometry, must have enjoyed a quite j
special thrill in ending the life of so eminent a male- j
factor. An ignorant American bigot can enjoy the same j
thrill in pitting his democratic power against men
whose views are obnoxous to the uneducated.

The opponents of academic freedom, if they could
have their way, would reduce this country to the level
of Germany as regards the promulgation of doctrines of
which they disapprove. They would substitute organ
ized tyranny for individual thought; they would pro
scribe everything new; they would cause the com
munity to ossify, and in the end they would produce
a series of generations which would pass from birth
to death wtihout leaving any trace in the history of
mankind.

The opponents of academic freedom, if they could

of Germany as regards the promulgation of doctrines of
which they disapprove. They would substitute organ

munity to ossify, and in the end they would produce
a series of generations which would pass from birth
to death wtihout leaving any trace in the history of
mankind.

which endeavor between them to establish an eco

combined by the accusation of communism, which is
recklessly hurled against anyone whose opinions are
disliked.
