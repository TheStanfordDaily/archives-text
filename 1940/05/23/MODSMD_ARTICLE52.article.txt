# Evans Offers Near-Perfect 'King Richard'
## 
### 
"KING RICHARD II," now play- |
ing at the Geary Theater in San j
Francisco.
Unadulterated excellence like that j
of Maurice Evans' production of {
"King Richard II" is hard to break
down into a worth by worth inven
tory. The best you can do is to say
that technically, emotionally, and as
a matter of taste the play comes ef
fortlessly near to perfection.
Evans has been accused from
time to time of acting from the ears
up. And certainly enough he does.
His willful, perverse, tortured Rich
ard has a clever brain behind it that
often shows through in patches of
technique or manner and leaves you
sitting there very conscious of Mr.
Evans' being a keen actor. Good
example is his behavior in the middle
of the second act. Still, although it
shoots the mood sky high, you can't
really resent watching a man be
efficient.
That, along with a slight fogginess
produced by the splicing toward the
front, is the only objection.
Bolingbroke, by Donald Ran
dolph was a handsome brute, left
you pleasantly in the lurch about
whether he is (a) the Eagle Scout,
(b) a grade-B so-and-so, (c) or an
opportunist. Nice play of character
comes in the gradual coarsening of
his spirit as Richard's gets corre
spondingly purer.
Franz Bendtsen's Duke of York
was a fussy, warm, old putterer,
while Guant portrayed by John Bar
clay, was a magnificent Gothic giant
with enough insides for the whole
lot. Charles Dalton was good as
porky, powerful Northumberland.
But the Queen was the most de
lightful. She is Carmen Mathews,
whom Mr. Evans took on for his re
vival in April. She lilts without
mawkishness, is thoroughly graceful
and intelligent. Pretty thing, too.
Incidental music is fine, and is deli
cate enough never to make you con
scious of ;i drum and bugle outfit do
ing fanfares or whatever in the of
fing. Sets are heavily colored, some
cozy, some bleak, and all achieved
without much fuss. Perhaps the most
significant example of the care for
detail is the rise and fall of a prop
ship's mast as she lies at the quay
at Bristol
There the production is, then:
sharp, warm, emotionally a shot in
the arm, with only the consciousness
of its own excellence as a detri- i
ment. â€”Gould
