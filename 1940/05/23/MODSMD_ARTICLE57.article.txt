WASHINGTON, May 22 (UP). â€”
Some of the American-made bomb
ers which the Allies have bought are
being flown across the Atlantic, Ar
thur B. Purvis, head of the Anglo-
French purchasing mission, revealed
today. He declined to disclose the
point of departure but it was as
sumed it is Botwood, Newfound
land, which is British territory.
The U. S. Neutrality Act prohibits
either Allied or American pilots
from flying foreign-purchased ships
from this country. The law can be
circumvented, however, by taking
the planes to the Canadian border
and pushing them across to the Ca
nadian side.
