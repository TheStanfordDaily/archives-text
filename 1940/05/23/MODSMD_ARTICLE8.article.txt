## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Last night a small, but very privileged audience turned up at Memo
rial Hall lo see the Division of Music's presentation of the Moore-Benct
operetta, "The Headless Horseman." If it's cricket to indulge in some wish
thinking, we go on record as saying it's worth a repeat performance.
Beautifully staged and costumed, this delightful little piece, only an

hour long, was fun from the
ning to the end, both for the au
dience and the cast. Of course there
were weak spots, but considering the
fact that this is the Division's first
attempt at a serious musical presen
tation with a student cast, the fu
ture presages fine things.
DESIGNED FOR COLLEGES
Douglas Moore and Stephen Vin
cent Benet designed their operetta
primarily for college presentation
both from the musical and technical
standpoints. The music is tuneful
and Benet's libretto is clever and
witty all the way through.
Credit, all sorts of it, must go to
Nicholas Goldschmidt, who trained
the singers, and whipped the orches
tra into shape. And F. Cowlcs
Strickland's fine directing hand is
very obvious. Best of the singers
was Joel Carter, whose perform
ance of Ichabod Crane was not only
well sung, but hilarious comedy.
YOUNG SHOWS ABILITY
Second to Carter was Gaieties
man Brad Young as Brom Jones. Far
more than a popular ballad singer,
Young acts with ease and eclat.
Emerson Hiler took over the role
of Cornelius Van Tassel, playing the
part with blustering excellence.
Choruses and orchestra were beau
tifully integrated.
Carter gets special mention for his
specially written chorus on the
Stanford cellar. Benet couldn't have
done better.
