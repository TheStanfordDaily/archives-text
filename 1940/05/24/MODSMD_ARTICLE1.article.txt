### WILSON CANNON 
ahead of their 1914 coun
terparts; posting new victories
on the English Channel 30 miles
from Dover; apparently unstoppable
in their terrifying advance toward
London and Paris; the green-grey
horde of Nazi troops are still not
swift enough to satisfy Reichsfueh
rer Adolf Hitler.
Germany's chief yesterday urged
his military inner circle to shift the
Nazi juggernaut into a faster gear.
Drunk with victory, Herr Hitler
was emotionally high-strung and
garrulous as he tongue-lashed his
high command into speed . . . speed
. . . and more speed.
The fluid advance of well trained
mechanized forces gained army
leaders no pat on the hack from
Hitler. His vibrant voice cracked
with invective as he urged them to
redouble already superhuman ef
forts.
But Der Fuehrer's dramatic bid to
give his formidable army an un
needed shot in the arm fell slightly
flat in this country. American news
papers were already carrying an
other story in which Hitler spokes
men described their leader's confi
dence, even described the stages by
which the German forces would
reach an early victory.
Hitler and his spokesmen evi
dently got their signals mixed.

HPHESE Charlie McCarthies, wheth
er or not speaking officially, told
a lucid tale of future events in the
life of Germany's blitzkrieg army.
Hitler's war plan, as reported in
Berlin, envisages:
1. Annihilation of the 1,000,000
British, French, and Belgian troops
north of the Somme River. This
would be accomplished by a tighten
ing of the German "iron ring" and
the sweep of motorized forces all
along the coast.
This last move would eliminate
escape by sea for the British
troops.
2. Possible French capitulation
after the "smashing" of the main
French army.
Nothing in yesterday's United
Press dispatches indicated that the
main French army along the Somme
was in danger of being "smashed."
Nor was there anything to indicate
France would sue for a separate
peace.
The gloom of two days ago was
dispersed. The French seemed filled
with defiance and rejuvenated spir
its.
3. Start of a devastating blitzkrieg
against the British Isles by air and
by sea from the near-by French-
Belgian coast..
German planes, as though to give
Britons a taste of what may come,
yesterday raised the Kentish coast of
England. The bomb-party was a
short one.
4. Then, with Fritain beaten into
submission, peace on Hitler's own
dictated terms.

old "dictatorship," however, in
dicated that no British peace move
would be made while a single por
tion of England's wide-flung colo
nial empire remained.
With the threat of invasion ever
moving closer Britain moved to
strengthen her home front against
and "trojan horse" activities.
Armed with its new powers, the
government virtually wiped out the
core of Britain's Fascist movement.
Yesterday Sir Oswald Moslcy,
leader of the British Fascists, was
arrested along with several other
Fascist suspects.
Active members of the Anglo-
German organization were snared
in the police sweep. Arrested were
several of those who hailed the
Munich result as a great boon for
peace.
Simultaneously, over 150 members
of the outlawed Irish Republican
army were expelled from Britain.
The government revealed that the
"back door" of Britain was being
closed through negotiations with
governments of both parts of Ire
land.
In London, Prime Minister
Churchill curtly ruled out any sug
gestions of a sepai'ate peace.
