# Curator of Branner Library Finishes 50 Years of Teaching
## 
### 
Today, on his 80th birthday, Dr.
Solon Shedd of Stanford University
is nearing the end of a vigorous
teaching career that has spanned
half a century.
As the goal—so years as a teacher
—that he set for himself a long time
ago approaches, the veteran geologist
is beginning to regret that it means
leaving his position as curator of the
Branner Geological Library.
"The idea just came to me that I
would like to be on the job 50 years,"
he said solemnly, reluctant to con
fess that his enormous appetite for
hard work probably had something
to do with the decision.
Retirement holds no fascination
for this hale and hearty man who
ended one career only to start an
other. He has plans for Stanford
which he wants to have a hand in
carrying out.
A spacious, well equipped library
in a new building for the Department
of Geology is a project that he will
continue to dream of and labor for
even after he retires this June.
In addition to more than 15 years
of service, Dr. Shedd has given the
University his campus home at 663
San Juan and established the Jean
nette Bell Shedd Fund of $20,000 for
the support of Branner Library. Mrs.
Shedd, to whom the fund is a me
morial, died last autumn. His gift
more than doubled the endowment
of the library he has worked to de
velop and improve.
In 1895 Dr. Shedd went to Wash
ington State College as an assistant
professor and saw the first four-year
class graduate at Pullman. He re
mained there to become head of the
department and later state geologist.
Reaching the age of 65 at Wash
ington State, Dr. Shedd decided in
1926 to start life anew somewhere

else. He liked California, and espe
cially Stanford, so he came here as
curator of the Branner Library. To
day the library is unexcelled on the
Coast and one of the most important
in the United States.
He does not profess to have any
plans for the quiet days after retire
ment, but friends are urging him to
write his memoirs of 50 years of
geology on the Pacific Coast.
Among his undergraduate friends
were President Ray Lyman Wilbur
of Stanford and former President
Herbert Hoover.
Dr. Shcdd keeps a keen eye on
the affairs of the nation and the
; world through the medium of the
newspapers and the radio.
"I think the American public is far
more neutral today than it was be
fore the first* world war," he said.
J "Europe quickly forgot the goal we
fought for last time. We won't be so
j willing this time."
Dr. Shedd hasn't picked a favo
rite from among the candidates for
President in the approaching elec
tion, but he won't vote for Roose
; velt. He cast his first presidential
ballot for James G. Blaine, who was
defeated in 1884 by G rover Cleve-
J land.
Sharply critical of Roosevelt's
j foreign policy, his comment was that
I the President "talks too much."
"He will talk us into trouble yet,"
j was the good-natured observation.
Dr. Shedd hasn't much to say
about his life work except that "it's
far from being done yet."
"I am extremely grateful to Stan
ford for what it has enabled me to
do," he concluded with the proud
j smile of a man who has done a good
I job and knows it.

teaching career that has spanned
half a century.
As the goal—so years as a teacher
—that he set for himself a long time
ago approaches, the veteran geologist
is beginning to regret that it means
leaving his position as curator of the
Branner Geological Library.
"The idea just came to me that I
would like to be on the job 50 years,"
he said solemnly, reluctant to con
fess that his enormous appetite for
hard work probably had something
to do with the decision.
Retirement holds no fascination
for this hale and hearty man who
ended one career only to start an
other. He has plans for Stanford
which he wants to have a hand in
carrying out.
A spacious, well equipped library
in a new building for the Department
of Geology is a project that he will
continue to dream of and labor for
even after he retires this June.
In addition to more than 15 years
of service, Dr. Shedd has given the
University his campus home at 663
San Juan and established the Jean
nette Bell Shedd Fund of $20,000 for
the support of Branner Library. Mrs.
Shedd, to whom the fund is a me
morial, died last autumn. His gift
more than doubled the endowment
of the library he has worked to de
velop and improve.
In 1895 Dr. Shedd went to Wash
ington State College as an assistant
professor and saw the first four-year
class graduate at Pullman. He re
mained there to become head of the
department and later state geologist.
Reaching the age of 65 at Wash
ington State, Dr. Shedd decided in
1926 to start life anew somewhere

else. He liked California, and espe
cially Stanford, so he came here as
curator of the Branner Library. To
day the library is unexcelled on the
Coast and one of the most important
in the United States.
He does not profess to have any
plans for the quiet days after retire
ment, but friends are urging him to
write his memoirs of 50 years of
geology on the Pacific Coast.
Among his undergraduate friends
were President Ray Lyman Wilbur
of Stanford and former President
Herbert Hoover.
Dr. Shcdd keeps a keen eye on
the affairs of the nation and the
; world through the medium of the
newspapers and the radio.
"I think the American public is far
more neutral today than it was be
fore the first* world war," he said.
J "Europe quickly forgot the goal we
fought for last time. We won't be so
j willing this time."
Dr. Shedd hasn't picked a favo
rite from among the candidates for
President in the approaching elec
tion, but he won't vote for Roose
; velt. He cast his first presidential
ballot for James G. Blaine, who was
defeated in 1884 by G rover Cleve-
J land.
Sharply critical of Roosevelt's
j foreign policy, his comment was that
I the President "talks too much."
"He will talk us into trouble yet,"
j was the good-natured observation.
Dr. Shedd hasn't much to say
about his life work except that "it's
far from being done yet."
"I am extremely grateful to Stan
ford for what it has enabled me to
do," he concluded with the proud
j smile of a man who has done a good
I job and knows it.
