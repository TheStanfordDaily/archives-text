# Flayers to Give Chekhov Drama
## 
### 
Stanford's hard-working stage
crew is winding up a stiff theater
season with the difficult job of mak
ing sets and props for "The Three
Sisters" which will be produced in
the Little Theater May 29, 30 and
31.
Waldemar Johansen, technical ad
viser for the production, admitted
that staging for the Chekhov play is
one of the hardest tasks ever given
an amateur crew. The period of the
play requires Russian realism style
for the sets, and it's proving a prob
lem to round up heavy Victorian
furniture of the times, as well as add
oil lamps and authentic samovars to
the properties.
One scene calls for a pocket knife
with combination nail file, scissors,
and ear spoon attached. Another
scene requires a china clock of the
period which is to be broken in the
end.
