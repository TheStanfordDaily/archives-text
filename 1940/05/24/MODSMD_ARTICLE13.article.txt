Also at yesterday's meeting six

work in "George and Margaret" and
"Richard II"; Mary Jean Haynes,
dance director of the Spring Show;

Bill Quinn, who was a member of
the Gaieties and Spring Show cast;
and Nancy Behlke, who played the
"stranglcr," and authored the song
' Split the Pot" from the same show.
Because of unavoidable delay in
evaluating the points of a number of
technical workers, outgoing Presi
dent Winters appointed a commit
tee with voting power to elect these
new members to the society.
The Ram's Head banquet for the
installation of new officers will be
held a week from next Monday, ac
cording to Winters. The plaques, on
which are engraved the names of
the two living groups contributing
most meritoriously to the Spring
Show, will be awarded to representa
tives of the respective living groups
at that time.
