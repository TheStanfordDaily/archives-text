# Tuition Rates Leveled For '41 Wilbur Hopes
## 
### BUD AMES 
Although the additional amount of
income coming to the University as
a result of yesterday's tuition raise
will not meet the deficit which the
University is facing, President Wli
bur yesterday expressed the hope
that "through savings, increase in
income, and gifts, that it may not be
necessary to make another so large
increase in tuition in 1941.
"The University has already re
ceived considerable amounts in gifts
for the support of special projects
and from annual contributions.
Strong efforts will be made to in
crease the funds coming from these
sources."
NOTHING CHANGED
Further commenting on the cir
cumstances surrounding the tuition
raise, President Wilbur said, "The
present syllabus and laboratory fees
collected by the University are to
be continued, and the tuition notes
for needy students up to the full
amount of the tuition are to be al
lowed under the usual rules. And
an additional sum of approximately
$30,000 is to be set aside for grants
in aid and scholarships."
But tuition raises are not new to
Stanford. They are almost common.
When Stanford opened its doors in
October, 1891, there was a free
scholarship for every student. The
endowment provided by Senator and
Mrs. Stanford was then generous
enough to cover costs of the Univer
sity operation.
AND THEN CHANGE
After the death of Senator Stan
ford the change began. Mrs. Stan
ford made agreements with Dr. Jor
dan so that a registration fee was
collected from all students. This fee
began at $10 per quarter.
And then the World War brought
to the Farm a period of economic re
adjustment. In September of 1919 the
Board of Trustees appointed a com
mittee to approach the state Legisla
ture for permission to charge gen
eral tuition fees and to increa.se the
fees in such professional schools as
Engineering and Medicine.
At the time of this action, students
were paying to the University fees
of $20 per quarter, of which $10
went for incidental costs of light and
heat, $2 for Associated Student en
tex-prises, $3 for clubhouse and
guild, and $5 for gymnasium.
ANOTHER RAISE
In October of that year, the Board
established a tuition fee of $40 per
quarter in addition to the above ex
isting incidental fees. At this time
the privilege of taking out tuition
notes was also established.
In November of 1920, the same
board established a higher tuition
fee—s7s per quarter which went
into effpet fall quarter of 1921.
The next wait was longer. But
beginning with January 1, 1927, all
students registered for the first time
in any department or schools on the
campus, except Graduate School of
Business, were required to pay tui
tion fees of $85 per quarter. This
included incidental fees.
THAT FATAL YEAR
In that fateful year, 1929, came
the last raise—this time to $100 per
quarter in all departments except
Medicine and Graduate School of
Business. This raise was to apply to
all students entering thereafter.
Last week the Board of Trustees
acted again.

increase in tuition in 1941.
"The University has already re
ceived considerable amounts in gifts
for the support of special projects
and from annual contributions.
Strong efforts will be made to in
crease the funds coming from these
sources."
NOTHING CHANGED
Further commenting on the cir
cumstances surrounding the tuition
raise, President Wilbur said, "The
present syllabus and laboratory fees
collected by the University are to
be continued, and the tuition notes
for needy students up to the full
amount of the tuition are to be al
lowed under the usual rules. And
an additional sum of approximately
$30,000 is to be set aside for grants
in aid and scholarships."
But tuition raises are not new to
Stanford. They are almost common.
When Stanford opened its doors in
October, 1891, there was a free
scholarship for every student. The
endowment provided by Senator and
Mrs. Stanford was then generous
enough to cover costs of the Univer
sity operation.
AND THEN CHANGE
After the death of Senator Stan
ford the change began. Mrs. Stan
ford made agreements with Dr. Jor
dan so that a registration fee was
collected from all students. This fee
began at $10 per quarter.
And then the World War brought
to the Farm a period of economic re
adjustment. In September of 1919 the
Board of Trustees appointed a com
mittee to approach the state Legisla
ture for permission to charge gen
eral tuition fees and to increa.se the
fees in such professional schools as
Engineering and Medicine.
At the time of this action, students
were paying to the University fees
of $20 per quarter, of which $10
went for incidental costs of light and
heat, $2 for Associated Student en
tex-prises, $3 for clubhouse and
guild, and $5 for gymnasium.
ANOTHER RAISE
In October of that year, the Board
established a tuition fee of $40 per
quarter in addition to the above ex
isting incidental fees. At this time
the privilege of taking out tuition
notes was also established.
In November of 1920, the same
board established a higher tuition
fee—s7s per quarter which went
into effpet fall quarter of 1921.
The next wait was longer. But
beginning with January 1, 1927, all
students registered for the first time
in any department or schools on the
campus, except Graduate School of
Business, were required to pay tui
tion fees of $85 per quarter. This
included incidental fees.
THAT FATAL YEAR
In that fateful year, 1929, came
the last raise—this time to $100 per
quarter in all departments except
Medicine and Graduate School of
Business. This raise was to apply to
all students entering thereafter.
Last week the Board of Trustees
acted again.
Although the additional amount of
income coming to the University as
a result of yesterday's tuition raise
will not meet the deficit which the
University is facing, President Wli
bur yesterday expressed the hope
that "through savings, increase in
income, and gifts, that it may not be
necessary to make another so large
increase in tuition in 1941.
