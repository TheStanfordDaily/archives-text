# Churchill Reveals Germans Have Mashed to Boulogne, Within 30 Miles of Britain
## Loss of Nearest Channel Port Would Endanger Escape of Allied Armies From Untenable Northern France 
### 
LONDON, May 23 (UP). —German forces have smashed across France
into parts of the important channel port of Boulogne, within cannon shot
of the British coast 30 miles away, Prime Minister Winston Churchill
revealed in Parliament today.
Heavy fighting in and around Boulogne is now going on, Churchill said.

adding the latest developments car-4
ried implications of a "serious char
acter" although it was too early to
determine the outcome of the battle. J
It - was said here loss of Boulogne
would be a terrific blow to the Al
lies and probably quickly would ;
make Calais, the nearest French 1
channel port to England, untenable,
thus endangering any attempt to
evacuate the Allies' army in north- j
ern France.
ESCAPE CLOSED? |
Boulogne is one of the principal
ports through which the Allied army
of the north must evacuate if it can
not fight its way south through the
German ring of steel.

With the Germans almost within
sight of the English coast at Bou
logne, British leaders expected Allied
Generalissimo Maxime Weygand to
launch a major counter-offensive
aimed at crushing both flanks of the
Nazi salient to the channel.
These leaders warned against
"undue optimsm," however, and said
extensive preparations would be
needed for any such undertaking,
probably requiring several days.
Fighting continued in and around
Boulogne tonight.
GERMANS IN PERIL
The German motorized units which
stormed into the vital seaport came
through a gap to the east and it was
said here they have scant chance of
holding out unless they receive in
fantry reenforcements quickly.
Likewise, it was said, the spear
head's rear communications lines
are under constant bombing attack
by British planes, which are de
stroying bridges and raili'oads.
If the Germans hold Boulogne, it
was noted here, they can utilize
long range artillery for the bom
bardment of British Channel ports
such as Dover, Folkestone, and Deal.
It would also give the Germans a
potential air base only a few min
utes bomber-flying time from Brit
ain.
BRITISH PLANES FLY
British warplanes attacking in
waves, bombed and machine-gun
ned German troops and communica
tions all the way from the French
coast of the English Channel to
Leipzig, Germany, during the last 48
hours, the Air Ministry said.
The biggest individual operation
apparently was a six-hour raid by a
special force of Blenheim bombers
against the German armored force
on the channel, on which about 100
bombs were dropped "well within
the target area."
A German ammunition train at
Gelden, near the Dutch frontier, was
said to have been blown up by Brit
ish bombs, the explosion rocking the
British planes high in the air and
destroying a section of the railway.

Boulogne is one of the principal
ports through which the Allied army
of the north must evacuate if it can
not fight its way south through the
German ring of steel.

With the Germans almost within
sight of the English coast at Bou
logne, British leaders expected Allied
Generalissimo Maxime Weygand to
launch a major counter-offensive
aimed at crushing both flanks of the
Nazi salient to the channel.
These leaders warned against
"undue optimsm," however, and said
extensive preparations would be
needed for any such undertaking,
probably requiring several days.
Fighting continued in and around
Boulogne tonight.
