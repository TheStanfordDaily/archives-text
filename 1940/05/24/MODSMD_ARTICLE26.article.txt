# Whittlesey Releases 10-point Program for Initiation Period
## 
### HAL SHAFER 
Repercussions from Interfraternity
; Board of Control's newly levied
anti-paddling law were bounding
back and forth between the Row and
Encina's hallowed halls in innumer
able bull sessions late this week.
While Encinamen were showing
evident signs of relief and while
many Row men were digging deeper
into their bags of tricks, Pete Whit
tlesey, Interfraternity president, re
leased the full 10-point program
regulating Initiation Period.
NEW REGULATIONS
Rulings are as follows:
1. That this period, in all its pub
licity and use, be known as Initia
tion Period.
2. That the various fraternities
shall, during this period, design
their programs in a constructive pat
tern to add to initiates' knowledge
concerning fraternities, their organi
zation, and their problems, as well as
contributing to a more complete
knowledge of Stanford University.
3. That whichever week be chosen
for the Initiation Period in 1940-41
shall last only from Friday noon to
G p.m. Sunday. Formal rituals shall
be held at discretion of individual
houses.
4. The initiation activities shall be
restricted to the house and grounds
of the local chapter house. Under no
circumstances will quests be per
mitted.
5. Adequate measures must be
taken to safeguard the health of the
initiates. This includes reasonable
food, six consecutive hours of night
sleep in every 24, and no unreason
able physical treatment. The latter
includes outlawing of the paddle,
which is in accordance with the
A.S.S.U. Constitution.
G. Adequate measures must be
taken to safeguard the scholarship of

the initiates. Study periods shall be
provided of not less than two hours
per day.
7. There shall be no hazing of
neophytes. (An interpretation of this
rule by the board points out that
house duties and pranks will be-per
mitted as long as there is no public
disturbance. Fraternity men will be
expected to conduct themselves as
"intelligent University people.")
8. The activities should not inter
fere with the peace and quiet of any
other person or group of persons.
9. An Initiation Period Commit
tee with a board member as chair
man shall again administer, in co
operation with the Interfraternity
Council president, the details of the
program. The committee shall estab
lish its own on-campus inspection
committee to enforce these regula
tions. And finally as a penalty for
the violation of these regulations
violating fraternities will be liable,
upon the judgment of the Interfra
ternity Board of Control, or a maxi
mum fine of $100, payable to Inter
fraternity treasurer.
10. Each fraternity shall report in
advance to the Initiation Period
Committee at the offices of the In
terfraternity Council the details of
its Initiation Period program.
SCHOLARSHIP RULE
A new ruling was made to the ef
fect that if a Row man flunks out
of school, goes to a junior college for
a year and makes a good record,
it will be necessary to go plus for
only one quarter after his return in
order to move into a house. Whit
tlesey reminded that pledges must
have a C average to move into their
houses next fall.
