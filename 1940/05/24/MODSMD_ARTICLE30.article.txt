# Dr. Brown Finds 1940-41 Poor Time for Sabbatical
## 
### DICK DUDMAN 
This may be a good year for large
■ sized newspaper type and for hys
' terical-voiced radio announcers, but
| in some ways it's an awful time i'or
a sabbatical year.
At least, that is the opinion of Dr.
Harold Chapman Brown, professor
of philosophy, who will be on leave
j next year.
"Can't do much traveling," he
says. "Can't go to Europe; can't go
to the Orient. About the only place
left is Mexico—l may go down there
for a while. 11 there isn't a war
i there, that is.
NOTHING SURE
"My headquarters will be at my
I place up at Inverness, north of the
Bay. From there I'll take side trip,
maybe do some writing. But how
can anybody tell for suie, with things
: the way they are now, what he's
going to be doing during the coming
j year?"
At Stanford since 1914, Dr. Brown
saw a number of students leave for
| Europe during the last war—many
of them ate their last breakfasts at
j his house.
"Many of those who returned were
scarred physicaiiy, and almost all
! were scarred mentally," he says. "In
fact, I know of only one or two of the
j men who returned who were com-
I pletely unharmed.
! NO ILLUSIONS
Dr. Brown has no illusions regard
j ing the present European war.
"It is the outcome of blunders,"' he
! says, "and its immediate repercus-
I sion on us is almost sure to be a se
i rious loss of the social gainst of the
! last few years."
Experience as a local Red Cross
administrator during the last war
taught him much about why men
I enlist.
"I never realized how many men
are just enduring marriage. As many
as one-third, 1 would say, were glad
of the chance to enlist and get away
—if not from their homes, from com
petitive conditions in which they
were not making good.
"Many didn't know their wives'
maiden names or whether or not
their brothers and sisters and par
j ents still were living."
HE UNDERSTANDS
Casual auditors of Dr. Brown's
| lectures complain of his enunciation.
| He complains of it himself, advising
J his classes to ask for repetition when
they don't get it the first time.
Regular students at his classes,
: however, learn to sit as near the
front as possible to hear this big,
white-haired man, lecture from his
| leather notebook, digressing from
j time to time into music( literature,
I politics, and (lately) economics.
Homely examples of an almost
Bob Burnsian type punctuate most

lof his lectures. To illustrate the
I transient quality of mora] standards,
|he told his class about the "most
I daring" sport engaged in by the
| boys of his gang—sitting on the
| curb, catching glimpses of women's
ankles as they got on and oil the
streetcars.
BULL SESSION REPORTS
To Dr. Brown, Platonic dialogues
[ are "stenographic reports of bull
S sessions"; committees are composed
! of men often "severally intelligent,
but collectively stupid."
Following the Socratic method to
j .some degree, he often lets question
ers supply their own answers by
I turning their queries back with a
j fresh angle or a novel interpretation.
In keeping with this Socratic at
i mosphere is Dr. Brown's dress, which
j might best be described as being in
a state of intellectual disorder. Nat
tiness simply wouldn't be consistent.
Following the sabbatical year,
Stanford will have three more years
in which to hear this authority on
philosophy, conversant, apparently,
j with most fields among the arts and
j sciences. At the end of that time
i he is slated for retirement.
