# Cards Aim at Trojans In P.C.C. Track Meet
## 
### CHUCK SMITH 
A crippled Stanford track team
left for Lus Angeles last night at
7:30 o'clock with a 50-50 chance of
taking U.S.C. for the second time
this year and winning the Pacific
Coast Conference for the first
time since its renewal in 1937.
Minus the services ol such sure
point-getters as Sid Hayes in the
hurdles, Mush Girard in the dis
tances, and Jim Lincoln in the high
jump, the Cards are going to be
hard pressed for victory.
With these three stars able to per
form and with Captain Clyde Jef
frey in top shape, there would have
been little doubt that Coach Bill El
lington's team would win. But now
an Indian victory depends mainly on
whether or not Jeffrey can run as he
used to before that muscle cramp in
the Fresno Relays.
SPRINTERS FACE STARS
Jeff, aided by his little, fast-de
veloping teammate, Ken Battaglia,
faces such speed merchants as Lee
Orr of Washington State, who has
run the 220 in 21 flat, Mickey An
derson of U.S.C., who does around
9.7 in the hundred and 21.2 in the
furlong, Hal Sinclair of U.C.L.A.,
and Jack Emigh of Montana.
This same Orr will be a tough one
for the Cards' three quarter-milers,
Craig Williamson, Ernie Clark, and
Charlie Shaw to beat. There will
also be Troy's Howard Upton and
the surprising Clarence Barnes of
California to contend with, as well
as Jimmy Todd of Washington and
Tom Bradley of U.C.L.A.
TOUGH HALF MILE
Things in the half mile are going
to be made tough for the Indians'
Paul Moore by a couple of northern
boys . After running the mile, Paul
will have to bounce back plenty
strong and fast to beat such runners
as Oregon State's Bill Dale, who has
done 1:51, and Oregon's Kerm Storli.
Don't forget the old Trojan war
horse, Louie Zamperini, and his
team-mate, Art Reading, as well as
Cal's Denzil Widel. Stanford's Blair
Hyde and Ernie Clark will really
have to hustle to get themselves a
place in this brilliant field.
MILERS ENTERED
The five best milers in Pacific
Coast's track history will be .entered
in this Conference meet. There will
be the favorite, Paul Moore of Stan
ford. at about 4:11, plus Troy's Zam
perini, Idaho's Phil Liebowitz, and
Oregon State's Dixie Gamer at 4:12
as well as that other Trojan, Leroy
Weed ,at about 4:13.
Garner, if he doesn't take the mile,
is pretty well assured of the first
in the two-mile despite Cal's tireless
trio ol Ted Vollmer, Charlie Cooper,
and Loren Mclntyre for the north
erner last week ran 9:24.
With Sid Hayes out it looks as
though Don Hommell and Ivy Bled
soe of U.S.C. will steal, the show in
the high hurdles unless Dick Simp
son of Stanford gets over his stage
fright and runs the flight he is ca
pable of. To liven things up there
will be Jim McGoldrick of Wash
ington, Bill Lacefield of Ucla, and
Mel Long of Cal.
ORR THREATENS
In the lows Lee Orr will threaten
to take his third race of the day
with the Coast's best time of 23.4 to
his credit.
Even with Les Johnson filling in
for Jeffrey on the Stanford relay
team, the Indians should win an
other first against a classy field.
Big Stan Andersen ought to take
two firsts in the weight, events and
Bill Trout and Arn Cornett are both
capable of second places if they per
form their best. Bob Stone in the
javelin will probably have to be sat
isfied with a third against the strong
arms of Troy's Hugo DeGroot and
Oregon's Boyd Brown.
Though the going will be tough,
other Indians are capable of sneak
ing in for those valuable third and
fourth place points which decide a
big meet like this one. Watch for
results from Al Grey in the shot, Bob
Williams in the javelin, Ray Brown
in the broad jump. Bob Kenyon in
the pole vault, and Russ Wulff, car
rying on for the injured Lincoln in
the high jump.
Mourning doves, contrary to popu
lar belief, do not travel more than
20 miles a day.
