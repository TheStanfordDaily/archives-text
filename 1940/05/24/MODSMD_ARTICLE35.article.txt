# DiMag Homes As Yanks Lose
## 
### 
Buck Newsom slithered his fast
hall across ahead of the New York
Yankees yesterday to pitch the
Detroit Tigers to a 3-2 victory
over last year's national champs.
The Yanks had won two straight
and showed signs of shaking their
slump until they collided with
Newscin, who stopped (hem with
six hits. Joe DiMaggio and Hank
Greenberg hit home runs.
Coming from behind with a riotous
10-run rally in the eighth inning,
the Chicago V/hite Sox walloped the
Philadelphia Athletics, 13-4, for their
fourth straight victory. Fourteen
White Sox went to bat in the eighth
frame, making seven hits oft two
pitchers while the A's contributed
four errors to the slaughter.
George McQuinn's second homer
of the game sparked a three-run
twelfth-inning rally that gave the
St. Louis Browns an 8-7 victory over
the Washington Senators.
The Chicago Cubs put over two
runs in the thirteenth inning and
then called on Vance Page to nip
a Philadelphia rally for a 4-3 victory
in the major leagues' first night game
of the season. Hugh Mulcahy went
all the way for the Phils and was
clipped for 15 hits.
Boston at Cleveland was rained
out, as were all National League
games aside from the Cub-Phillie
affair.
