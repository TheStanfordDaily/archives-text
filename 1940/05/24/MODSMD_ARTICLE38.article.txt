# Baseballers Meet Moffett Team Again
## 
### 
Stanford's 1941 baseball team takes
on Moffett Field's diamondmen
again tomorrow afternoon at 3:15
o'clock in the Sunken Diamond in
another spring practice contest with
Russ Smith, Bill Masters and Claude
Purkitt as pitchers.
Coach Harry Woltcr, very glad
that the game could be arranged be
cause of the added game-experience
it gives his squad, plans to start
about the same team he used against
1 the Moffett nine last time out, which
! means that the following outfit will
| probably start the game: Herb At
kinson, catcher; Hal Costello, first
; base; Harry Parsons, second base;
: Elton Boone, third base; Herb Bull,
J shortstop; Jack Parsons, Cootie
I Thompson, and Alec Cereghino or
I Pat Nagano in the outfield.
