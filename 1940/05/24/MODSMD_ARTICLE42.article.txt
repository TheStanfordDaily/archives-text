ALTHOUGH the regular football
season is still several months off,
interest in the top college sport of
the nation is already running high—
not as high as it does during the sea
son, perhaps, but high nevertheless.
Out on the practice field here at
Stanford, a goodly number of grid
ders are having all kinds of fun,
though their work is hard and per
formed seriously. They are having
fun, they say, because they're really
learning to play football — learning
more about,, it than most of them
knew there was to learn.
For football has been revolution
ized here at. Stanford. Perhaps the
word "revolutionized" is a little too
strong: but the type of football the
Indians are playing and the way
they are going about it are cer
tainly different this spring than they
have been around here for a long
time.
The boys are working like the
very dickens out there on the
practice fiield these days, hut they
.love it. Just ask any of them if.
they're working harder than they
have in past years of spring grid
drill and most of them will answer
"yes." Ask the same fellows if it's
too hard, if they'd rather take it
easier; we'd bet our boots the an
swer you'd get would he a very
emphatic "NO!"
Football is a game that is fun to
play. But it is a game which, like
most other games, is much more fun

to play when you win. And that is
just what Coach Clark Shaughnessy,
his coaching staff, and his players
are aiming at. The Indians are going
to be a winning football team next
fall if they have anything to say
about it.
* * :.'t
BUT THE THING IS: It won't be
so much what they say about it as
it will be what they do about it.
And that seems to be Shaughnessy's
theory, too, for the wily Scotch-Irish
coach, whose wit is as sharp as a
razor, isn't, saying much these days.
But he's teaching his players football
as they never knew it before.
It's no! only Shaughnessy who is
teaching the gridders, hut it is also
the assistant coaches, who make up
what is probably as good a staff of
working aides any head coach on
the Coast has—and probably bet
ter.
Just take Jim Lawson, for instance.
Jim ,a former Stanford Ail-American
himself, has been end coach here at
the Farm for a good many years, and
while he has been here he has turned
out any number of top-flight wing
men. Jim Moscrip and Keith Top
ping, two of the Vow Boys, were
products of Jim's coaching. And
take Stan Graff of this year's var
sity. At many schools a fellow the
size of Graff, who isn't very large,
would be riding the bench; but Law
son has made Stan into a really good
little end.
* * *
WE COUD GO ON for hours
writing about the assistant coaching
staff, telling of what Bernie MaSter
son, Marchy Schwartz, Phil Bengt
son, and Husky Hunt are doing
with the gridders, but there just is
n't space.

they're working harder than they
have in past years of spring grid

"yes." Ask the same fellows if it's
too hard, if they'd rather take it

Football is a game that is fun to
play. But it is a game which, like
most other games, is much more fun

to play when you win. And that is
just what Coach Clark Shaughnessy,
his coaching staff, and his players
are aiming at. The Indians are going
to be a winning football team next
fall if they have anything to say
about it.
* * :.'t
BUT THE THING IS: It won't be
so much what they say about it as
it will be what they do about it.
And that seems to be Shaughnessy's
theory, too, for the wily Scotch-Irish
coach, whose wit is as sharp as a
razor, isn't, saying much these days.
But he's teaching his players football
as they never knew it before.
It's no! only Shaughnessy who is
teaching the gridders, hut it is also
the assistant coaches, who make up
what is probably as good a staff of
working aides any head coach on
the Coast has—and probably bet
ter.
Just take Jim Lawson, for instance.
Jim ,a former Stanford Ail-American
himself, has been end coach here at
the Farm for a good many years, and
while he has been here he has turned
out any number of top-flight wing
men. Jim Moscrip and Keith Top
ping, two of the Vow Boys, were
products of Jim's coaching. And
take Stan Graff of this year's var
sity. At many schools a fellow the
size of Graff, who isn't very large,
would be riding the bench; but Law
son has made Stan into a really good
little end.

ALTHOUGH the regular football
season is still several months off,
interest in the top college sport of
the nation is already running high—
not as high as it does during the sea
son, perhaps, but high nevertheless.
Out on the practice field here at
Stanford, a goodly number of grid
ders are having all kinds of fun,
though their work is hard and per
formed seriously. They are having
fun, they say, because they're really
learning to play football — learning
more about,, it than most of them
knew there was to learn.
For football has been revolution
ized here at. Stanford. Perhaps the
word "revolutionized" is a little too
strong: but the type of football the
Indians are playing and the way
they are going about it are cer
tainly different this spring than they
have been around here for a long
time.
The boys are working like the
