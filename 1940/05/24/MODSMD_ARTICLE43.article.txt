# Frankie Albert Shines in Drill; Norberg Tough
## 
### 
Pouring on the heal in this ne>ri
to thi> last week of practice, Coach
Clark Shaughnessy sent liis large
squad through another double
scrimmage behind locked gates
yesterday.
While Assistant Coaches Bernie
: Masterson, Harry Shipkey, and
[ Husky Hunt were conducting a
i scrum between the fourth and fifth
j teams at one end of the field,
; Shaughnessy, Jim. Lawson, and
! Marchy Schwartz were scrimmag
j ing two other teams at the other
j end of the field. At the same time
I Phil Bengtson was handling the non
j scrimmaging outfit in play drill.
With a team made up of Fred
Meyer, Jack Warnecke, Chick Orme,
Doug Stahle, Johnny Kerman,
Winkie Junes, and Stan Graff in the
line, and Frank Albert, Hugh Callar
neau, Pete Kmetovic, and Norm
Standlee in the backfield, the "A"
team started out the scrum session
against the third team like a house
afire.
Albert tossed a quick pass to
Kmetovic in front of the defensive
right halfback, with little Pete
springing into the clear. Albert did
a bit of running on his own as he
broke into the open on a cutback
inside the defensive right end.
''Chief" Standlee also looked good,
especially on cross-bucks into the
line from the T-formation.
When the second team got into
the scrum, they depended mostly on
I the tricky running of A1 Cole, who
j had trouble getting past the line of
scrimmage.
i SECONDS ARE TOUGH
On defense the seconds made the
going tough for the offensive teams,
with big Hank Norberg especially
looking good at end. The second
outfit, using mostly sophomores, was
made up of Ed Stamm and Norberg
at ends, Chuck Taylor and Bruno
Banducci at tackles, Yank Levin and
Ed McCain at guards, Vic Lindskog,
center, and Milt Vucinich, A1 Cole,
Jack Francis, John Casey, and Ray
Hammett (alternated with Cole) in
the backfield.
A pair of flashy halfbacks, Cookie
South and Art Rasmussen, sparked
(the affair between the fourth and
i fifth outfits, both breaking into the
clear time and time again.
Colin McClintock, tall center, left
practice early with what is believed
to be a strained back muscle.
Motor transport pays its way,
meeting its full charges for high
way, road and street construction
and maintenance.
