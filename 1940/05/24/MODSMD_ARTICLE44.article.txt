BOSTON, May 23 (UP).—Ameri
can League ball players would like
to play all their games in Boston.
At every game of the season new
baseball fan, Miss Dolores Mitchell
of Andover, Mass., occupies a box
seat near the third babe dugout
where she chats with the players,
managers and umpires alike, with a
smile for each—and a generous sup
ply of candy for all.
