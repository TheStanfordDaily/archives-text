r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
It is bad enough when our administrative royal
ists attempt to turn fraternities into maternities, but
when they go so far as to sin against the basic exu
beranee and time-honored pastimes of youth it is
time to squeeze a few grapes of wrath.
I refer to the attempted squelch on romance. An
impregnable fence has sprouted about the scenic and
traditional nineteenth hole at the golf course. The
c-actus garden is h happy hunting ground for a black
md white wet blanket on wheels. No longer are "two
or three cars parked under the stars" on the other
Ox Roads about the Farm because of these unabashed
poachers in puttees.
Perhaps the term "necking" has a vulgar connota
tion to our superiors. But a rose by any other name
would smell as sweet. Perhaps they fear that maraud
ers might spring on unsuspecting spooners in the moon

beams. If so, by their actions they are merely driving
I hem into tiie uncharted region in the rear where a
shout for assistance would be heard by only the poison
oak. Or is thus crop control of wild oats an attempt
to quell the natural mechanisms of "this flaming gen
eration."
Shucks, there have always been lovers' lanes, two
heads on one shoulder, and lipstick on handkerchiefs.
I'll bet even maw and paw tossed a bit of woo before
their amalgamation.
So for the sake of good clean lun, don't drive us
into the hinterland. Give us the golf course, cactus
garden, and the other secluded lanes to do the things
that will be done though hell and Gordy should bar
the way. Remember all the world loves a lover, and
you can't have same without a basis for operations.
Love and kisses
