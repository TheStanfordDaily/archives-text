# EAST INDIAN SITUATION
## 
### 
T'HE EDITOR, SIR:
Too few Americans realize the seriousness of the
situation in the Dutch East Indies. The conquering
of Holland by Germany has brought the U. S. face
to face with a situation that may explode any hour.
The Dutch have a force in the East Indies capable of
withstanding any attacks but those by Japan. Japan
has long desired these rich islands of the Pacific, not
jnly as an outlet for her over-crowded population but
also because of the important natural resources of these
territories.
Great Britain, which might have stopped the Japa
nese, is involved in Europe. The American government
is immobile because this is election year. The Japa
nese not only know this, but they have a sense of
timing of when to strike, which is even better than
Hitler'sâ€”and his is almost perfect. Will the army and
navy follow their basic policy of doing what the civil
government says they won't and strike in the Dutch
East Indies? You had better watch your morning
newspaper.
