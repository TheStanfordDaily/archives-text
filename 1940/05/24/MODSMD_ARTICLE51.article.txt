### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
A FAREWELL TO MORALS
IN 1917 there was a hu« and cry against unrestricted
submarine warfare. Today people are talking about
new war atrocities —bombing of civilians, shooting ev
ery tenth man in the village, ad infinitum, ad nau
seam. They are all horrible to picture; they bliztkrieg
the sentiments.
And because of the disgust and sympathy that mur
der and brutality arouse, people fail to think the issues
through, and resign their opinions to the whims of
their glands. The fundamental premise from which
all reasoning on war atrocities should start, is the in
human lawlessness of war itself. War is not a modern
heir to Medieval dreams of chivalry. It is not a great
jousting bout in which the champions of two sides set
tle an argument by skill and strength in fair combat.
When people just set about to destroy one another,
to blow people up with steel and explosives, all ele
ments of reasoned justice and argument by law have
at least temporarily been abandoned. When millions
of men are armed with the latest and most efficient
means of tearing apart men and their constructive
work, as one R.O.T.C. commander acidly remarked,
"Someone is bound to get hurt." War itself is com
plete abandonment of judicious procedure. It is an
appeal to force and brutality, and it is hence a com
plete abandonment of morality and ethics.
That is why each side recognizes but one crime—
betrayal. That is why each side shoots the spies of
its opponent and trains men to spy against the enemy.
The sole strategy of war is to win, and expediency is
the only governor upon man's ingenuity in the use
:>f murdering force.
The Germans did not use unrestricted submarine
warfare in 1917 any sooner than they did because they
did not wish to antagonize a potential enemy. That
was expediency, not morality. And when they finally
did sink our ships, they did it because that was the
best military (or naval) strategy in the opinion of
the German war chiefs. England would have done the
same thing had it been to her best military interests,
expediency considered.
And so, while the current atrocity stories are tragic,
they are no more tragic than the simple three-letter
word that describes Europe. It is foolish to decide
the merits of one side or the other in a war on the
basis of which side has committed the most atrocities.
The fact that both sides always violate international
law, the fact that both sides always do their immoral
best to win, proves that only one thing governs the
moves of an army—military expediency.
And military expediency leaves no room for kind
thoughts and morals, unless the morals are selfish
shams to win support. War is hell, and hell knows no
ten commandments.

their glands. The fundamental premise from which
all reasoning on war atrocities should start, is the in
human lawlessness of war itself. War is not a modern
heir to Medieval dreams of chivalry. It is not a great
jousting bout in which the champions of two sides set
tle an argument by skill and strength in fair combat.
When people just set about to destroy one another,
to blow people up with steel and explosives, all ele
ments of reasoned justice and argument by law have
at least temporarily been abandoned. When millions
of men are armed with the latest and most efficient
means of tearing apart men and their constructive
work, as one R.O.T.C. commander acidly remarked,
"Someone is bound to get hurt." War itself is com
plete abandonment of judicious procedure. It is an
appeal to force and brutality, and it is hence a com
plete abandonment of morality and ethics.
That is why each side recognizes but one crime—
betrayal. That is why each side shoots the spies of
its opponent and trains men to spy against the enemy.
The sole strategy of war is to win, and expediency is
the only governor upon man's ingenuity in the use
:>f murdering force.
The Germans did not use unrestricted submarine
warfare in 1917 any sooner than they did because they
did not wish to antagonize a potential enemy. That
was expediency, not morality. And when they finally
did sink our ships, they did it because that was the
best military (or naval) strategy in the opinion of
the German war chiefs. England would have done the
same thing had it been to her best military interests,
expediency considered.
And so, while the current atrocity stories are tragic,
they are no more tragic than the simple three-letter
word that describes Europe. It is foolish to decide
the merits of one side or the other in a war on the
basis of which side has committed the most atrocities.
The fact that both sides always violate international
law, the fact that both sides always do their immoral
best to win, proves that only one thing governs the
moves of an army—military expediency.
And military expediency leaves no room for kind
thoughts and morals, unless the morals are selfish
shams to win support. War is hell, and hell knows no
ten commandments.
A FAREWELL TO MORALS
IN 1917 there was a hu« and cry against unrestricted
submarine warfare. Today people are talking about
new war atrocities —bombing of civilians, shooting ev
ery tenth man in the village, ad infinitum, ad nau
seam. They are all horrible to picture; they bliztkrieg
the sentiments.
And because of the disgust and sympathy that mur
der and brutality arouse, people fail to think the issues
through, and resign their opinions to the whims of
their glands. The fundamental premise from which
all reasoning on war atrocities should start, is the in
