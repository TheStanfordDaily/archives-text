## STANFORD HERITAGE—dhur 
### KEN CUTHBERTSON 
A FTER four years here on the Farm, wc seniors are
about ready to tread the paths of the Frost Amphi
theater and receive our sheepskins. We can safely
assume that our education was worth the time and
expense we spent. But( no, I'm not going to get senti
mental) it seems to me that we are leaving Stanford
without knowing enough about the school and its
history.
We hear abstract statements concerning Stanford
traditions; but traditions thrive on an understanding
and feeling which can't be received from a Daily ar
ticle or editorial. Traditions are. valuable only when
the upholders know the history behind them. Per
haps it would be to the best advantage of students
interested in Stanford tradition to check up a bit on
its history.
Actually, our knowledge of Stanford history is lim
ited to a paragraph or two in the Freshman Handbook
plus possible additions from alumni acquaintances.
For myself, I have at times found it quite embarrass
ing to answer with a bleak "I dunno" when questioned
on important facts about our traditions and their
history.
* ♦ * ♦
WUCH embarrassment led me to look in the library
for information, which I soon found to be very
colorful and interesting. The Daily files carry day-by
day campus stories that read like novels. The old
Quads show the Stanford rough in his true form, and
the Sequoia (forerunner of Chaparral) carries the torch
for old-time humorists. In addition to the publication
files in the Timothy Hopkins Room of the library,
many books written about famous Stanford officers
and events are available.
Since most students usually lack the time and ini
tiative to take them into the library in search of mate
rial on Stanford, I wonder if it wouldn't be worth
while for the University to undertake a one- or two
unit course presenting interesting lectures and read
ing material on Stanford's past. Emeritus Professor
Edward Hulme, for example, could certainly'tell some
great tales about the Farm.
Would students be interested in such a course? I
think so. Would they consider it just another pipe? I
think not. The course, in my opinion, would turn out
students who would not only be more appreciative of
Stanford, but also better nnd more interested alumni.

A FTER four years here on the Farm, wc seniors are
about ready to tread the paths of the Frost Amphi
theater and receive our sheepskins. We can safely
assume that our education was worth the time and
expense we spent. But( no, I'm not going to get senti
mental) it seems to me that we are leaving Stanford
without knowing enough about the school and its
history.
We hear abstract statements concerning Stanford
traditions; but traditions thrive on an understanding
and feeling which can't be received from a Daily ar
ticle or editorial. Traditions are. valuable only when
the upholders know the history behind them. Per
haps it would be to the best advantage of students
interested in Stanford tradition to check up a bit on
its history.
Actually, our knowledge of Stanford history is lim
ited to a paragraph or two in the Freshman Handbook
plus possible additions from alumni acquaintances.
For myself, I have at times found it quite embarrass
ing to answer with a bleak "I dunno" when questioned
on important facts about our traditions and their
history.
* ♦ * ♦
WUCH embarrassment led me to look in the library
for information, which I soon found to be very
colorful and interesting. The Daily files carry day-by
day campus stories that read like novels. The old
Quads show the Stanford rough in his true form, and
the Sequoia (forerunner of Chaparral) carries the torch
for old-time humorists. In addition to the publication
files in the Timothy Hopkins Room of the library,
many books written about famous Stanford officers
and events are available.
Since most students usually lack the time and ini
tiative to take them into the library in search of mate
rial on Stanford, I wonder if it wouldn't be worth
while for the University to undertake a one- or two
unit course presenting interesting lectures and read
ing material on Stanford's past. Emeritus Professor
Edward Hulme, for example, could certainly'tell some
great tales about the Farm.
Would students be interested in such a course? I
think so. Would they consider it just another pipe? I
think not. The course, in my opinion, would turn out
students who would not only be more appreciative of
Stanford, but also better nnd more interested alumni.
