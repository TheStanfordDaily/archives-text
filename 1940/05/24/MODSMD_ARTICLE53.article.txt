# Farm Actors Furnish Fillip For 'Red Mill'
## 
### 
"THE RED MILL." now playing
at the Palo Alto Community
Theater.
Victor Herbert's music and the
acting of two Stanfordites last night
transformed what would otherwise
have been a mediocre community
production of '"The Red Mill" into
excellent musical entertainment.
Harva Sprager, in the role of Tina,
the innkeeper's daughter, was out
standing among the feminine play
ers. Her singing of the light, flirta
tious songs" required by the part
added the racy touch needed to keep
the show from bogging sadly in
places.
LAWRY FUNNY
Among the male players Joe Law
ry, brother of Spring Show's John,
stood out in both the comic repartee
and the quartet and duo singing of
the lighter pieces such as "Whistle
It" and "Go While the Going's
Good." An incredibly ungainly crea
ture, he cavorted about the stage
with gusto and lack of gracefulness
worthy of the clumsiest of vaude
ville comedians.
Funniest scene of the play was
perhaps the one in which Lawry at
tempts to climb the Red Mill but
gets caught on one of the arms as it
is going 'round. In another he and
his partner-in-antics, Ad Dewey,
stage the old but always riotous act
of trying to sneak out quietly via a
two-story window. All in all, the
stagehands must have suffered se
vere nervous crises.
SOME MEDIOCRITY
The others, with perhaps the ex
ception of Clement Arnold in the
role of the innkeeper, played with
application by unavoidable medio
crity.
But Herbert, after all, means mu
sic, and music is what the Commun
ity Players give you. The duet,
quartet, and mixed chorus numbers
are really excellently done, and the
weak spots in the more sentimental
solos are made up for with ven
geance by Miss Sprager's numbers.
The orchestra, under the direction
of Elwyn Bugge, provided satisfac
tory accompaniment and set an all
time high for non-professional or
chestras by playing low enough so
that the audience can head the sing
ers.
The Community Players' well
deserved reputation of providing ex
cellent sets for their shows was borne
out in full by the setting for "The
Red Mill." Lighting and other tech
nical details were also done better
than average.â€”Minahan
