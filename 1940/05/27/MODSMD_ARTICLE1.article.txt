### WILSON CANNON 
JONDONs 'breathing spell is just
-J ,
about over.
Yesterday German communiques
disclosed that the French port of
Calais had fallen after a shattering
Nazi attack led by Stuka bombers
and mechanized divisions.
Twenty-two air miles across the
straits from Dover, Calais presum
ably will prove Germany's "hopping
off" point for the long-threatened
total war directed at the British
Isles.
At Number 10 Downing Street,
faces were grave as the English
Cabinet worked frantically over
defense plans which had not been
dusted off since 1066.
Nine hundred years of invinci
bility seemed doomed and British
international impregnability a
thing of the past to the man on
London streets.
But the man on the streets was
not especially worried over the
whole matter. Soothing syrup, in
the modicum of governmental radio
broadcasts, served to keep John
Bull sufficiently unposted on events
in World War 11.
Nazi leaders intimated, neverthe
less, that only the Allied troops
trapped in the Channel sector were
holding up the attack against
Britain.
They also claim that the 1,000,000
troops in the Nazi net were caught in
a "trap within a trap" and would
be forced to choose between sur
render or annihilation within the
very near future.
« sjt #
fiUT from the mass of foreign ob
servers who believe that England
can be invaded successfully, came a
few dissenting voices.
These sources pointed out that.
Channel ports are small, that they
could not accommodate the German
fleet necessary for such an under
taking.
An army of 50,000 men would
require almost 500 ships of the
type available for the Reich.
Britain's navy, though severely
hampered by the German air
threat, is still a formidable assort
ment of capable ships. The Ger
man floating army would find it
self attacked from the very start.
Every available English and
French warship would be on hand,
with as many warp lanes as could
be mustered.
On the British side of the rough
and slormy channel, heavy artillery
fire from grimly efficient defenders
would force an attacking flotilla to
literally bore its way in.
While Berlin has 20,000 parachute
troops available, such an expedition
would be spectacular, but hardly
constitute an overpowering force.
* * *
JN Washington, D.C., Congress yes
terday greased administrative
wheels in an "over the top" drive
designed to complete major phases
of President Roosevelt's gigantic de
fense program.
The President primed Congres
sional stalwarts for high-pitched ad
ministrative speed.
Huge army and navy supply bills,
passed unanimously by the Senate
last week, are now before House
appropriations subcommittees.
Capitol observers believe that the
House will merely consider the bills
as a matter of form, will return them
to the White House with a rubber
stamped okeh.
Foreseeing Congressional action
during the early days of this week,
those who sit in the shadow of the
White House claim that both
houses of Congress will busy
themselves with shoving through
all defense measures proposed by
the president.
Most important on the House
docket is a move to strengthen
control of fifth column activities
within the nation.
Humorous sidelight on an other
wise grim Capitol Avenue was a re
port clipped from one Senatorial
notebook. It was the record of an
offer of assistance from the Mothers'
League of America.
"We want to fight the parachute
troops," said the message in effect.

Twenty-two air miles across the

total war directed at the British

At Number 10 Downing Street,

Cabinet worked frantically over
defense plans which had not been

Nine hundred years of invinci
bility seemed doomed and British
international impregnability a
thing of the past to the man on
London streets.
But the man on the streets was
not especially worried over the
whole matter. Soothing syrup, in
the modicum of governmental radio
broadcasts, served to keep John
Bull sufficiently unposted on events
in World War 11.
Nazi leaders intimated, neverthe
less, that only the Allied troops
trapped in the Channel sector were
holding up the attack against
Britain.
They also claim that the 1,000,000
troops in the Nazi net were caught in
a "trap within a trap" and would
be forced to choose between sur

Channel ports are small, that they

An army of 50,000 men would
require almost 500 ships of the

Britain's navy, though severely
hampered by the German air
threat, is still a formidable assort
ment of capable ships. The Ger
man floating army would find it
self attacked from the very start.
Every available English and
French warship would be on hand,
with as many warp lanes as could
be mustered.
On the British side of the rough

fire from grimly efficient defenders
