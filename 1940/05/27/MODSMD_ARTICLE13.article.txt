IN THE SHOUT SPACE of a single week-end, blasting German divi
sions materially altered the above map. Shown are (1) Abbeville,
with Boulogne and Calais near by, which Germans have completely
surrounded in their Channel drive; (2) the Laon-Soissons area, start
ing point of a German drive on Paris; and (3) the Valcnciennes-
Cambrai sector, where Allied armies arc making desperate stands to
avoid entrapment in Belgium and northern France. Over the week
end, the German legions consolidated their drive to the Coast, and
now, they say, hold the entire area from a point midway between
Dunkerque and Calais to Abbeville. The British say they still arc
in possession of the keys to Channel defense, Boulogne and Calais.
