# New Plan Tried For Men's Halls
## 
### 
Because of the many mix-ups and
complications that have occurred in
the past in connection with reserv
ing rooms in the men's halls, a new
system is being tried out this year.

Under the new system, all lower
division men who are not on eating
club lists or pledged to fraternities
but wish to live in a hall next year
will report tomorrow at the Encina
office for drawings from which a
waiting list will be made up. These
drawings will take place from 3:30
to 5 o'clock in the afternoon and
from 10 to 11 o'clock in the evening.
Reserving of rooms for both eat
ing club members and others will
take place as usual in the Dean of
Men's office this coming Thursday
and Friday. Club lists should be
turned in at the Dean of Men's office
by noon today.
