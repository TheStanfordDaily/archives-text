and shifts into the swirling life of
the city with its confusion, rush,
misery, its crowded tenement neigh
borhoods, children playing in the
danger-fillod streets, and office em
ployees rushing hectically to work.

model small towns scattered over
the entire United States are present
ed as the solution.
