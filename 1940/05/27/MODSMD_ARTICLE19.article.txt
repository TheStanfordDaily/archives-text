# England Prepares Isle For Blitzkrieg Attack; F.D.R. Assures Nation
## Germans Boast 'British Next', Capture Calais 
### United Press 
Great Britain called her great
est military figure, General Sir
Edmund Ironside, away from the
war in Flanders Sunday night and
told him to bolster the defenses of
the British Isles against Germany's
threat of imminent invasion by
air and sea.
Germany, boasting again that
"England is next," claimed to have
seized the French Channel port of
Calais after a "hard fight" and to be
firmly established on a springboard
for the first invasion of the British
Isles in nearly 900 years.
The French simultaneously ad
mitted that the Germans had cap
tured Boulogne after bitter fighting
in the streets.
Thus, on the basis of the German
and French high command commu
niques, the Nazi war machine has a
75-mile foothold on the Channel
coast.
REPORT CALAIS CAPTURED
Tlie reported capture of Calais,
and a drive upon Gravelines about
halfway between Calais and Dun
kerque, came from the German high
command which issued a special
communique late tonight.
The high command claim must be
given credence, for in contrast with
the German DNB agency, its com
muniques thus far generally have
been true.
Earlier in the day the French had
denied that the Germans were even
near Calais and said that the Allies
held Boulogne, although it was ad
mitted that there fighting in the
southern outskirts of the Channel
port vital to French-British com
munications.
NEW TRAP LAID
To the rear of the German foot
hold on the coast the Allies battled
desperately to close the bottleneck
of the German corridor across North
ern France and claimed that in the
battle of Flanders the German drive
had been stalled "in all sectors"
with tremendous German losses.
The Germans disputed the French
claims and said that, instead of
standing still, they were forging a
new trap around the nearly 1,000,-
000 British, French and Belgian
troops cut off north of the bottle
neck, lying north of the Somme be
tween Peronne and Bapaume.
ROOSEVELT SCORES
CALAMITY HOWLING
WASHINGTON, May 26 (UP).â€”
President Roosevelt tonight assured
the nation that it has the most pow
erful peace-time military establish
ment. in the country's history and
called for an end to "calamity howl
ing, fears and illusions."

In the first fireside chat he has
made since Sept. 3, when he hoped
and believed that a "blackout of
peace' in the United States could
be averted, the President urged the
people to consider calmly what has
been done and what must be done
to safeguard the American hemi
sphere against aggression.
He promised that there will be no
ceiling to the defense roof, which
will be built "to whatever heights
the future may require."
Appealing for national participa
tion in the task ahead, the President
stoutly rejected the contention of
some that the American hemisphere
must abandon the freedom of its
citizens inherent in democracy to
cope with aggressors.
