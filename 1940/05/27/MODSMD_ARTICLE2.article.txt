# Russian Play Cast Fights Off Illness
## 'Sisters' Starts Run Wednesday Although Mumps, Colds Strike 
### 
Although several prominent mem
bers of the "Three Sisters" cast have
been laid low by illnesses ranging
from mumps to bronchitis, produc
tion of the Chekhov play is definitely
slated for May 29, 30, and 31.
Illness temporarily laid up several
members of the cast. "Mizzi" Hinds,
who will play Masha, was out for a
week with whooping cough. Eloise
Lambert, playing Natasha, was out a
week with the mumps, and Millie
Green, the Irena of the play, had
bronchitis for a few days. The onJy
one of the cast completely out of
the performance, is Dan Holtom,
who was forced to drop out because
of asthma. Charlie Bulotti will play
Holtom's part of Tchebutypin, a
friend of the family.
NEEDS SOME POLISH
Reunion of the whole cast has been
welcomed with relief by Director F.
Cowles Strickland, who admitted
that though the cast has been prac
ticing together for weeks as a class,
they need to speed up the polishing
process.
"The cast has to to work together
as a complete unit for this play," Mr.
Strickland declared. And he quoted
Eva Le Gallienne, noted for her per
formances of Chekhov plays. Miss
LeGallienne was convinced that
Chekhov required more than bril
liance. According to the actress his
work needs teamwork and co-opera
tion to insure success.
TIME APROPOS
Mr. Strickland felt that this spring
would be an auspicious time to pro
duce a Chekhov play because he had
the beginnings of a group nucleus
in his class. The show has not been
limited in rehearsal so far, and the
polishing up process was expedited
with an all-day rehearsal from 9 to
5 o'clock last Saturday.
Tickets for the show, which opens
Wednesday, may be secured for 50
cents by calling P.A. 22041, or by
purchase at the box office.

Lambert, playing Natasha, was out a

the performance, is Dan Holtom,

NEEDS SOME POLISH
Reunion of the whole cast has been
welcomed with relief by Director F.
Cowles Strickland, who admitted
that though the cast has been prac
ticing together for weeks as a class,
they need to speed up the polishing
process.
"The cast has to to work together
as a complete unit for this play," Mr.
Strickland declared. And he quoted
Eva Le Gallienne, noted for her per
formances of Chekhov plays. Miss
LeGallienne was convinced that
Chekhov required more than bril
liance. According to the actress his
work needs teamwork and co-opera
tion to insure success.
TIME APROPOS
Mr. Strickland felt that this spring
would be an auspicious time to pro
duce a Chekhov play because he had
the beginnings of a group nucleus
in his class. The show has not been
limited in rehearsal so far, and the
polishing up process was expedited
with an all-day rehearsal from 9 to
5 o'clock last Saturday.
Tickets for the show, which opens
Wednesday, may be secured for 50
cents by calling P.A. 22041, or by
purchase at the box office.
