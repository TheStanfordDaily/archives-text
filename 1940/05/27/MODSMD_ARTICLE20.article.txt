## Dr. Swain Adds Smelter Investigation to a Career Of Diversified Activities 
### 
Signal honors came to Stanford's professor of chemistry, Robert E.
Swain, when the Canadian government h few years ago picked him as its '
scientific adviser in a negotiation with the United States concerning smel
ler smoke which was drifting across the border from a plant in Vancou
ver. B.C.
I)r. Swain, who is retiring from his position as head of the Department

of Chemistry this year, has long<
been engaged in research dealing
with elimination ai smoke and dust
nuisances. Testimonial to his attain
ments in this field was the fact the
Canadian government chose him as
its representative, although he is a
citizen of this country.
VARIED CAREER

degree in 1899. He took his M.S. at
Yale, 1901, and his Ph.D. there in
1904. He also studied in Strassburg
and Heidelberg, Germany, 1901-02.
In 1928, Dr. Swain was awarded the
LL.D. degree by the College of the
Pacific in 1929.
He has been successively instruc
tor in chemistry, assistant profes
sor, associate professor, professor,
and head o£the department.
Signal honors came to Stanford's professor of chemistry, Robert E.
Swain, when the Canadian government h few years ago picked him as its '
scientific adviser in a negotiation with the United States concerning smel
ler smoke which was drifting across the border from a plant in Vancou
ver. B.C.
I)r. Swain, who is retiring from his position as head of the Department

of Chemistry this year, has long<
been engaged in research dealing
with elimination ai smoke and dust
nuisances. Testimonial to his attain
ments in this field was the fact the
Canadian government chose him as
its representative, although he is a
citizen of this country.
VARIED CAREER
Since 1917 executive head of his
department, Professor Swain's activ
ities have by no means been con
lined to the sandstone Chemistry
Building. He served as acting presi
dent of the University while Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur was in
Washington in Herbert Hoover's
Cabinet, 1929-33.
He has also served as a director of
the American Chemical Society,
president of the Board of Trustees of
the Califoma College in China, vice
president of the International Union
of Pure and Applied Chemistry, and
chairman of the Committee on Ac
credited of Universities and Col
leges of the American Chemical So
ciety.
COLLEAGUES SPEAK
Noted for his executive ability,
Professor Swain, according to his
colleagues in the Department of
Chemistry, is largely responsible for
the present size and quality of the
department. They cite the growth of
the department, its rating as the
equal of any similar departments in
the West, and the success of its
graduates as factors pointing toward
the efficiency of Professor Swain's
regime.
