# Farm Poetess Wins Laurels in Contest
## 
### 
Writers' Club Contest winners for
1939-40 were Wendy Downey, for her
poems, "Vassar Train" and "Inci
dent," and Glen Holland for his
story, "Kid's Show." No award was
given for essays since none of the
three entries was considered to
warrant an award.
Marion McClanahan's story, "The
Fire," and Doug Jaques' story,
"Headlights," received honorable
mention.
