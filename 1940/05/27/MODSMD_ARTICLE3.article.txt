# Townsend Asks Farm to Forum
## Leaders to Discuss Student Government 
### 
Anne Townsend, chairman of Ac
tivities Forum, has announced that
any student interested in the work
ings of campus activities is cordially
invited to the two sessions of the
Forum to be held on Wednesday and
Thursday.

Activities Forum, formerly Lead
ership Institute, will deal generally
with the problems of student gov
ernment. In particular, Wednesday
evening's discussion will take up the
card files, the Convalescent Home
Drive, and the proposed course in
Stanford history.

On Thursday evening Ken Cuth
bertson will speak on student gov
ernment as a whole and he will at
tempt to co-ordinate the various
discussions. After his talk the new
members of activities will meet to
discuss their work next year and
their own problems.
Members of the Forum committee
have stressed the fact that the name,
Leadership Institute, was changed to
Activities Forum because the name
seemed to discourage attendance at
the meetings.
"These two discussions are for
every person interested in any or all
phases of student government," ac
cording to Anne Townsend. "This is
their opportunity to show that in
terest."
