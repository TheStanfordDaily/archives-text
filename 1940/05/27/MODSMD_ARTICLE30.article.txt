Mentioned by Orrin Leslie Elliott
in his book, "Stanford University, |
The First Twenty-five Years," as one i
who "has given effective service in |
the organization and management of
the Library," Miss Hays first came '
to the Farm as an undergraduate I
student. She received her A.B. de
gree here in 189(5. Dr. Wilbur was
one of her classmates.
CAME TO FARM IN 1901
Miss Hays attended the New York
State Library School and sexved as
an assistant in the Home Education
Department of the New York State
Library. In 1901 she came to Stan
lord to the position of reference
librarian, which she occupied until

very definite plans, Miss Hays said

graphical work on early Stanford
history.
Speaking of Ken Cuthbertson's
recent Daily column, in which he

Miss Hays commented that she
thought the idea certainly had possi
bilities.
"I suppose there is no commun
ity which is still quite as close to
its beginnings as we are. It seems
a shame that the students should
n't have a more complete back
ground of our history."
Recently Miss Hays has sorted out
books on Stanford, the Quad, and
Daily files and grouped them all to
gether in a corner of the Library.

graphical work on early Stanford
history.
Speaking of Ken Cuthbertson's
recent Daily column, in which he
advocated a one- or two-unit course
on Stanford's history and traditions,
Miss Hays commented that she
thought the idea certainly had possi
bilities.
"I suppose there is no commun
ity which is still quite as close to
its beginnings as we are. It seems
a shame that the students should
n't have a more complete back
ground of our history."
Recently Miss Hays has sorted out
books on Stanford, the Quad, and
Daily files and grouped them all to
gether in a corner of the Library.
