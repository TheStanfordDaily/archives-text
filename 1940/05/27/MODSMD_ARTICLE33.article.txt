# Ellington to Coach P.C.C. Team in 'Big Ten Meet At Evanston Next Month
## 
### FRANK GUTHRIE 
That grand old man of the track
and iield coaching fraternity, Hill
Ellington ol Stanford was named
by his fellow contemporaries of
the Pacific Coast Conference to j
be bead man when their team
meets tbe liig Ten All-Stars in
Evanston. 111., on the Northwest
ern campus, June 17.
The P.C.C.-Big Ten dual meet is
an annual extravaganza which fol
lows in the wake of each confer- '
ence's championships, with the host I
conference paying the expenses of j
the first three-place men.
Stanford's Indian trackmen re- j
turned home this morning after j
dropping a bitter "dual meet" to I
their old nemesis from Southern I
California, Dean Cromwell's Trojans, j
by the respectable score of 55 to 53. j
FIVE FIRSTS
Despite defeat in the champion
ships, our Indians once again stole j
the spotlight from Trojan perform
ances as they cake-walked to five
first places â€” lour of them provided J
by the talented sprinting of Captain
Clyde Jeffrey and the mean weight ;
tossing of Stan Andersen. The other
victory was in the mile relay, which !
they won without the aid of Jeffrey !
in 3:14.
Although with only three first !
place winners, El Troje was stronger j
than Ellington's scantily-clads in !
seconds, thirds, and fourths; and j
with these places they managed to j
hang onto that two-point victory.
STANFORD SENDS S
Leading the P.C.C. contingent will !
be eight Indians: Jeffrey, Charley [
Shaw, Craig Williamson, Andersen, {
Dick Simpson, Bob Kenyon, Arnie I
Cornett, Bill Trout, Paul Moore, and :
eight Trojans: Mickey Anderson, I
Barney Willis, Louie Zamperini, Art 1
Kacewicz, Ken Dills, Don McNeil, |
John Wilson, and Gil LaCava or
Clark Mallery.
California will have Clarence j
Barnes. Denzil Widel, Barney Wolf,
Guinn Smith, Martin Biles, Lowell !
Smith, and Ted Vollmer, or seven '

entries.
Lee Orr, Dixie Garner, and Bill
Dale, Washington State men, will
also augment the P.C.C. outfit.
U.C.L.A. will have four entered;
Washington, one; Oregon, two, and
Idaho, one.
JEFF BUCKS WIND
Jeffrey, who ran into a stiff wind
in the 100-yard dash, was clocked
in 9.9 seconds, while Piker of
Northwestern went the distance in
9.7, but under ordinary conditions
Jeff would be favored because of his
record. The even event, strangely
enough, was in Jeff's 220-yard dash
event, which found both him and
Smith of Michigan running 21 sec
onds flat.
Stan Andersen's throw of 52:8% in
the shot put would place him well
ahead of the Big Ten's nearest com
petitor as also would Bill Trout of
the Indians, who was a pleasant sur
prise second Saturday at 52:3 x /4.
Andy's 159:3 :, /4 toss in the discus
would be one of those events shy,
however.
ALL STARS
Other P.C.C. strong points are the
440, where Lee Orr ripp&d off a
40.9 race, the mile where Louie Zam
perini edged out Paul Moore in
4:11.6, the two-mile where Garner
rambled 9:12.5, the low hurdles
where Orr again did 23.3, and Kenny
Dills, 14:3 in the vaulting event.
In addition the high jump of 6:7
by Johnny Wilson of Troy was best,
the jump of 25 feet even by Jackie
Robinson, the jack of all athletic
trades, was a foot better, Boyd
Brown's 212:4% javelin toss was
tops, and Stanford's 4:14 was two
seconds better than the winning re
lay in the Midwest.
So Bill Ellington will have one
of the strongest Pacific Coast Con
ference track and field teams ever
assembled under his wing. The
coaches voted the honor on Bill im
mediately after the meet, which
Troy won only by getting a fourth
in the mile relay.
