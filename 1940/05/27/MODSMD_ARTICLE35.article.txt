GRIDDERS ENTER LAST
WEEK OF TRAINING
Some 60 Stanford gridders will
j wind up an intensive 30-day spring
j practice period Saturday when the
first annual Football Field Day takes
I place on the Stadium gridiron. The
squad will put on what Don Lieben
i dorfer has dubbed a "glorified prac
; tice session," with kicking and pass
| ing contests for distance and accu
| racy and a short scrvm scheduled,
for the benefit of all those who want
| to see a preview of the 1940 Big Red
| Machine.
Saturday's festivities and tomor
row's open drill on the practice
field will be the last chances for
Farm grid fans to watch the team
in action and see just how much
progress the new coaching staff
has made in introducing an en
tirely new style of football to
| Stanford. Be warned in advance
that the squad will appear green,
and that there'll he a lot of fum
bles. but if you look carefully
you'll sec that the players are
getting accustomed to the new
system, and that almost every man
on the field shows tremendous im
provement in fundamentals.
The groundwork has been laid this
spring, and just how well will be
i seen Saturday. Next fall, in the
, comparatively few days of practice
before the season starts, Coach
Shaughnessy and his staff will in
| troduce the Indians to the intricacies
! of the system.
ATTENTION. PLEASE,
MR. THOMPSON
When the C.1.8.A. schedule closed
| this spring, a couple of St. Mary's
star diamondmen, Emmet O'Neill
and A1 Lingua packed their grips
and journeyed eastward to visit
Manager Joe Cronin and his Boston
! Red Sox. In their hip pockets were
; contracts to perform for the Hub
J City's American League entry.
O'Neill was the leadiflg pitcher
in California Intercollegiate circles
for the past two years. Ho topped
the circuit in won-and-lost per

centages and in strikeouts. Lingua, |
who held down third base for the 1
Gaels, was a powerful hitter and.
next to Jackie Robinson, the fleet
est base-runner in the league.
Two weeks ago Boston optioned
O'Neill to a club in the Eastern !
League, and Lingua to another one :
of their farm teams in the Piedmont
League. The salaries they'll draw in
that class of ball are, to say the least, j
meager, the odds against either
reaching the majors pretty big.
The men they'll be competing
against arc either ex-big leaguers
well along the downgrade or kids
younger than themselves who,
though they haven't had -a college
education, have probably had more
experience in organized ball than
the two Gaels.
All of which should serve as a
warning to Cootie Thompson, Card s
mound star who plans to travel east j
and talk contract with the Cincin- !
nati Reds soon. If Cootie signs, he
may be trading his last, season in a i
Stanford uniform for a summer of
playing ball on cow pastures in a j
Class B league. On the other hand, |
he may become a major league star.

MR. THOMPSON
When the C.1.8.A. schedule closed
| this spring, a couple of St. Mary's
star diamondmen, Emmet O'Neill
and A1 Lingua packed their grips
and journeyed eastward to visit
Manager Joe Cronin and his Boston
! Red Sox. In their hip pockets were
; contracts to perform for the Hub
J City's American League entry.
O'Neill was the leadiflg pitcher
in California Intercollegiate circles
for the past two years. Ho topped
the circuit in won-and-lost per

centages and in strikeouts. Lingua, |
who held down third base for the 1
Gaels, was a powerful hitter and.
next to Jackie Robinson, the fleet
est base-runner in the league.
Two weeks ago Boston optioned
O'Neill to a club in the Eastern !
League, and Lingua to another one :
of their farm teams in the Piedmont
League. The salaries they'll draw in
that class of ball are, to say the least, j
meager, the odds against either
reaching the majors pretty big.
The men they'll be competing
against arc either ex-big leaguers
well along the downgrade or kids
younger than themselves who,
though they haven't had -a college
education, have probably had more
experience in organized ball than
the two Gaels.
All of which should serve as a
warning to Cootie Thompson, Card s
mound star who plans to travel east j
and talk contract with the Cincin- !
nati Reds soon. If Cootie signs, he
may be trading his last, season in a i
Stanford uniform for a summer of
playing ball on cow pastures in a j
Class B league. On the other hand, |
he may become a major league star.

GRIDDERS ENTER LAST
WEEK OF TRAINING
Some 60 Stanford gridders will
j wind up an intensive 30-day spring
j practice period Saturday when the
first annual Football Field Day takes
I place on the Stadium gridiron. The
squad will put on what Don Lieben
i dorfer has dubbed a "glorified prac
; tice session," with kicking and pass
| ing contests for distance and accu
| racy and a short scrvm scheduled,
for the benefit of all those who want
| to see a preview of the 1940 Big Red
| Machine.
Saturday's festivities and tomor
row's open drill on the practice
field will be the last chances for
Farm grid fans to watch the team
in action and see just how much
progress the new coaching staff
has made in introducing an en
tirely new style of football to
| Stanford. Be warned in advance
that the squad will appear green,
and that there'll he a lot of fum
bles. but if you look carefully
you'll sec that the players are
getting accustomed to the new
system, and that almost every man
on the field shows tremendous im
provement in fundamentals.
The groundwork has been laid this
spring, and just how well will be
i seen Saturday. Next fall, in the
, comparatively few days of practice
before the season starts, Coach
Shaughnessy and his staff will in
| troduce the Indians to the intricacies
! of the system.
