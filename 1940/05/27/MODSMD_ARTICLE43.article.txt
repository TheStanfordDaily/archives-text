# Activity Men
## 
### 
A GOOD man) of our great educators still insist
that there is no good in extra-curricular activi
ties. They say that such tomfoolery conflicts with
the true academic spirit.
It a student spends lime outside the classroom,
the) claim he won't get enough book-learning. A
good many brilliant (sometimes dull) students are
of the same opinion.
The argument always seems to reach a peak dur
ing Phi Beta kappa sejson. Last week a Daily edi
torial writer mentioned the fact that some of the
new crop were more worthy than others because
they had an even distribution of book and outside
activity. A lot of the secluded geniuses and their
friends immediately popped up with the inevitable
answer that a I'hi Beta Kappa key is its own reward
and consequently that a cloistered key-wearer is as
good as the busiest of the committee men. Some
of the strictly academic advocates also have tried to
show that a host of the I'lii Betes work their way
through school in many devious and arduous fash
ions. therefore that they have no time for nor inter
est in llie life of a buzzing b.m.o.c.
To a large extent both groups are right. Any in
tellectual who can help himself through four years
<>f this capitalistic enterprise called college and still
end it|> within the charmed circle is as much an
activity man as the luizziesl of them. There is noth
ing so activating as real, honest-to-goodness work.
Committeemen work for fun, glory, and the feeling
of accomplishment; a poor scholar works for food
and lodging. â€¢
Despite what the pro and con of the topic really
decides, the tendency is going to be for a greater
interest in the extra-curricular. Several surveys at
various schools show that 70 per cent of the students
are participating in some kind of outside activity.
I his figure, moreover, doesn't include the total
number of students who work and are not in activi
ties. The dry-ball is apparently on the verge of a
purge.
From the point of view of the development of
personality, the ability to meet, convince, and con
verse. it would seem that every isolated bookworm
could find something to do in his few spare hours
that would make him a belter member of his college
community and a better prospect for permanent
good in the real outside world.
A genius who wants to lock all the doors and pull
all the shades while he is gleaning the words of
the masters might just as well buy his own books
and study in his homestead attic. Not even the
thought of tuition raises and boalhouse decks will
bother him there.
