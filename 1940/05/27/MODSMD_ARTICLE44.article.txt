# Honor

### 
/"|M\ of the foundations of a gentleman is his
" honor, and here at Stanford, more than at any
oilier I diversity, honor plays a vital role in the lives
of the students.
1 he Honor Code is more, much more than merely
signing the pledge after four hours of outpouring in
a final, or signing ones self in as being four min
utes past the fatal two-thirty deadline. It is, in
force, an agreement with one's self that decent,
honorable living is a sure way to help repay the
privilege of having been allowed to live at all. It
is in keeping with this spiril of men and women who
daily give I heir best efforts and in many instances
their very lives that the gentlemanly principles of
human relationships may endure.

At Stanford each one of us who assumes the re
sponsibility of living here is given the rare oppor
tunity of being able to keep his bargain with him
self and t<> live here, as nowhere else in the world,
with only his own personal, individual, and sacred
honor In answer to for his conduct. We at Stanford
are inclined to smugly forget thai onlv in two other
institutions of learning in the I nited States does
such a comparable situation exist, and this is the
Irecst and most unbound nation in the world.

lliis is not a vague, ethereal, mystical tradition
I luil we lia\c learned to respect from our freshman
days it is. rather, a rare, functioning example of
how human beings can li\c together with all their
diffen ■nccs without having to be guarded anil
watched and led along h\ the hand to see that they
conduct themselves honorably. No man should he
driven or coerced into li\in<> the way that he should
and could live if lie would onlv let himself do it.

l>\ preserving his honor a man allows other men
In preserve theirs, and by honorable conduct in all
phases of his life a man allows truth, justice, and
riphl to exist without the use of force or the tram
pling legions of military might.

I rider such conditions, when the \ital bases of
human living are being trod upon bv ignorance and
