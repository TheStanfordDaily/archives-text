# MAYBE WE ARE SUPERIOR
## 
### 
EDITOR, SIR:
I have been reading the editorials in The Daily
with increasing disgust. In their attempt to point
out that America must remain neutral, they have gone
to the extent of justifying Germany, and accusing the
English and French of being the chief cause of the
present war.
Now anybody can deny that the Germans had many
just complaints, but with an arch-appeaser like Cham
berlain in office, coupled with the feelings of the people
of the Allied countries during the last few years, there
was never any need for this war. The blame is squarely
on the shoulders of one man for bringing it about, re
gardless of motives. Anyone that can justify the
death of millions of men is guilty of the second-rate
thinking that characterizes The Daily editorials.
The prime fear expressed seei'ns to be that we must
not be tricked into fighting to undo what the Allies
brought on themselves; that we must keep out of
what does not concern us. Such a stand is ridiculous.
. . . This attitude is characteristically American on
a situation which they cannot understand, namely, the
need for a nation, surrounded by aggressor nations, to
fight for its existence, or go under. Well insulated by
oceans and peaceful neighbors, Americans point with
pride that we are greatly superior to the Europeans be
cause we can stay out of war!
