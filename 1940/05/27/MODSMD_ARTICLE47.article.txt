All in all, I do not think housemothers would be
as hard on fraternities as fraternities would be on
housemothers, but since we have all agreed that we
could never find suitable ones, we may as well content
ourselves with the demerit system. It has been used
to good advantage in grammar schools. It would be used
out of place at Stanford. Minor offenses would rate
one demerit - dropping cigarette ashes on the living
room rug. Major offenses would be punishable by two
demerits, i.e., grinding cigarette butt into living room
rug with heel. A beautiful six-color certificate, suit
able for framing, would be awarded with each demei'it,
and a certain number could be turned in on a toaster
or copy of Emily Post.
