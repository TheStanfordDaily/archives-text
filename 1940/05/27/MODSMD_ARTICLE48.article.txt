# BULL SESSION
## EVEN THE QUAD HAS EARS 
### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
641 OYAL Americans' have been writing letters of
warning to The Daily. "Look out for a local
fifth column," they say. "Look out for a blitzkrieging
Trojan horse, humming 'Horst Wessel'."
We are very appreciative of the fact that conscien
tious American citizens are doing their best to protect
our country. But this business of a fifth column can
be carried a little too far. Actually, our agents have
been unable to find any organized menace to Stanford
or American security.
It is true, of course, that subversive individuals, on
and off the Daily staff, have been maliciously under
mining Stanford solidarity with pleas for neutrality.
But, revolutionary as that radical idea of neutrality may
be, the neutrals are really just neutrals, as distin
guished from Nazi spies or Italian Fascisti.
I know one neutral, believe it or not, who looks like
a perfectly normal chap with two eyes, a nose, and so
forth. In fact, he looks almost normal enough to be
taken for a pro-Britisher. He doesn't wear a black
beard or say his prayers to Adolph, and he didn't
descend upon the campus by parachute.
Shocking as that may seem, this will probably be
even more amazing: He believes in democracy, not in
fascism. He doesn't condone dictatorship or the oppres
sion and brutality that exists in other parts of the
world. In short, he is quite a firm advocate of the
democratic way of life. He believes in neutrality, how
ever, and in the eyes of some that seems to stamp
him as a fifth columnist.
* * * *
IT is quite understandable that Americans should get
so excited about borers-from-within and sabotage,
now that the press dispatches are full of fifth column
stories and Trojan horses. And it is quite natural to be
apprehensive about the security of our own state. But
nothing could be more absurd than to assume that
everyone whose opinions differ from our own is a
corporal in the German fifth column. If the Nazis are
doing underground work in this country, they are
probably doing it with a little more intelligence than it
would take to hire college students to go around
talking for neutrality.
One of the great tragedies of the last war was the
loss of freedom and democratic privileges in the war
ring nations. In this country, German sympathizers
were the victims of mob violence and bigotry. Now I
haven't been reading Dick Tracy lately, but I sup
pose that during the last war the United States gov
ernment actually traced and caught some German spies.
But I sincerely doubt that the disgusting reactions of
the mob really helped the police catch spies or our
army to win the war.
Real, not to be confused with loud, patriots don't
want our democratic government overthrown. But they
also hope that a sixth column of anti-fifth-columnist
will not make it risky to express an honest opinion.

so excited about borers-from-within and sabotage,
now that the press dispatches are full of fifth column
stories and Trojan horses. And it is quite natural to be
apprehensive about the security of our own state. But
nothing could be more absurd than to assume that
everyone whose opinions differ from our own is a
corporal in the German fifth column. If the Nazis are
doing underground work in this country, they are
probably doing it with a little more intelligence than it
would take to hire college students to go around
talking for neutrality.
One of the great tragedies of the last war was the
loss of freedom and democratic privileges in the war
ring nations. In this country, German sympathizers
were the victims of mob violence and bigotry. Now I
haven't been reading Dick Tracy lately, but I sup
pose that during the last war the United States gov
ernment actually traced and caught some German spies.
But I sincerely doubt that the disgusting reactions of
the mob really helped the police catch spies or our
army to win the war.
Real, not to be confused with loud, patriots don't
want our democratic government overthrown. But they
also hope that a sixth column of anti-fifth-columnist
will not make it risky to express an honest opinion.
641 OYAL Americans' have been writing letters of
warning to The Daily. "Look out for a local
fifth column," they say. "Look out for a blitzkrieging
Trojan horse, humming 'Horst Wessel'."
We are very appreciative of the fact that conscien
tious American citizens are doing their best to protect
our country. But this business of a fifth column can
be carried a little too far. Actually, our agents have
been unable to find any organized menace to Stanford
or American security.
It is true, of course, that subversive individuals, on
and off the Daily staff, have been maliciously under
mining Stanford solidarity with pleas for neutrality.
But, revolutionary as that radical idea of neutrality may
be, the neutrals are really just neutrals, as distin
guished from Nazi spies or Italian Fascisti.
I know one neutral, believe it or not, who looks like
a perfectly normal chap with two eyes, a nose, and so
forth. In fact, he looks almost normal enough to be
taken for a pro-Britisher. He doesn't wear a black
beard or say his prayers to Adolph, and he didn't
descend upon the campus by parachute.
Shocking as that may seem, this will probably be
even more amazing: He believes in democracy, not in
fascism. He doesn't condone dictatorship or the oppres
sion and brutality that exists in other parts of the
world. In short, he is quite a firm advocate of the
democratic way of life. He believes in neutrality, how
ever, and in the eyes of some that seems to stamp
him as a fifth columnist.
