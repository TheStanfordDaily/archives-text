dress rehearsal is over. It's a real war. And
here in placid Princeton there are ominous reper
cussions.
"It's a matter of months before we're in it now."
"M-Day's just around the corner." "No chance of keep
ing out any more." This is what we've been hearing
around the campus.
This kind of talk is ominous because it is defeat
ism. It is yielding to a state of mind which will drag us
into the war if it is not stopped.
We have no business getting involved in the hideous
bedlam of 1940 Europe. And we won't—unless we suc
cumb to the kind of thoughtless emotionalism that in
toxicated this country in 1917.
Sure, we're all disgusted with what's going on. But
the disgust is apt to turn into hate against Hitler and
his Germany. And hate is dangerous. It blinds us to
the fact that Hitler is only the product of a situation
caused by another war.
It's the situation that made Hitler which we should
hate. It is war that we should hate and oppose with all
the common sense and cool thinking we can muster.
We're going to need a lot of that cool thinking in
the coming months.
