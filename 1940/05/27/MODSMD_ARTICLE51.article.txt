# Movie Version Of 'Rebecca' Hits the Spot
## 
### 
"Rebecca," now playing at the Stan
ford Theater, Palo Alto
In his excellent production of
Daphne du Maurier's "Rebecca,"
David O. Selznick has managed to
tell the story faithfully and present
his audiences with gripping enter
tainment.
It is in a picture such as "Rebecca"
that all the technical advances of
the industry are apparent. Photog
raphy by George Barnes, especially
shots of the Manderley grounds and
of Monte Carlo, is a thrilling back
ground to the action of the picture.
Franz Waxman, musical director,
has built a stirring "Rebecca" theme
which is heard throughout the show
whenever reminders of the dead
woman intrude on the anonymous
heroine.
OLIVIER EXCELS
Laurence Olivier, as Maxim de
Winter, is right up there in the
"Heathcliff" groove as far as acting
goes. As the depressed, tempera
mental master of Manderley who
lives in the shadow of his renowned
wife's death, he gives an excellent
performance.
As far as Joan Fontaine goes, she
certainly need never have a qualm
about trading in on the fame of her
sister, Olivia de Havilland. She is
a fine actress in her own right. High
spot in her performance comes
when Maxim tells her that he hated
his former wife. Her facial expres
sion at that moment could well be
preserved for aspiring actresses as
an example of near-perfection in an
emotional scene.
ANDERSON TERRIFIES
Judith Anderson, well known for
her stage performance in "The Old
Maid," achieves the ultimate in por
trayal of cold, fish-like characters.
Her "Miss Danvers" terrifies mem
bers of the audience every bit as
much as the character terrified the
shy heroine.
So, hop a bus, thumb a ride, or
get a pogo stick, but do get down
and see "Rebecca."â€”Mullany
