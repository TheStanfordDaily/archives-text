# Band, Glee Club Will Present Pop' Concert in Amphitheater
## 
### 
Stanford's band and glee club combine efforts in their second annual
joint concert Thursday in the Frost Memorial Amphitheater.
Inaugurated last spring by Charles Bubb, band director, the concert is
the climax of the Farm's musical year and gives the band a chance to
present some serious music. "In the fall, we play as loud and nennv as

possible at football games and ral
lies," commented Mr. Bubb yester
day, "and in winter we work hard
supporting the basketball team. But
in spring we try and get away from
thus athletic emphasis and play
some serious concert pieces."
This spring's program will feature
the trumpet trio of Boardman Moore,
Robert Williams, and Kenneth Rob
erts playing Edwin Franko Gold
man's "Echo Waltz," an outstanding
composition featured by the Gold
man band last year at the San Fran
cisco Fair. The trio is one-half of
the gridiron fanfare group that her
alded the entrance of the band into
the Stadium at last fall's football
games.
The concert is Mr. Bubb's pet proj
ect and he hopes to present the af
fair every spring. Perfect accous
tically for an outdoor military band
concert, the amphitheater proved an
ideal place for the performance last
year.
"We are doing our bit to keep this
beautiful outdoor auditorium that
was given to the school from becom
ing a white elephant," says Mr.
Bubb. "It's real value and attrac
tiveness, especially in spring, are not
appreciated by the majority of Stan
ford people."
