### WILSON CANNON 
A FEW weeks ago Britain's David
Lloyd George said, "England is
in a worse predicament now than
she ever was during the First World
War."
Last night Adolf Hitler described
England's position in almost identical
words. Der Fuehrer, seldom thrifty
with his claims, apparently is work
ing on a sure hunch this time.
Impetus to Herr Hitler's, "boogy
woogy" claim was the Nazi capture
of the French channel ports of
Boulogne and Calais.
A trident-shaped attack fea
tured the German putsch toward
the coast. Once again British dead
lay amid Flanders poppies as Nazi
mechanized forces apparently at
tempted to hack the great Allied
defense circle into three pieces.
German ears rang with incessant
claims that an actual blitzkrieg on
England was imminent. This thesis
gained more than popular support
through the Nazi army, where sol
diers danced to the tune of:
"And we'll go marching through
England."
Claims to complete domination of
the Channel entrance were made by
exuberant Nazi spokesmen. "Lon
don is cut off," they reported. "Eng
lish trade through Channel lanes
has been reduced to negligible im
portance."

\V/ELL informed observers be
lieved that if and when the in
vasion of England came, it would
be undertaken by concerted action
of bombers, troop transports, para
chutists, submarines, and speed
boats.
They pictured bombers in mass
attacks on the main British military
centers. Stuka dive bombers would
concentrate upon air fields and
naval harbors, reinforced by speedy
attack planes.
Simultaneously, according to the
orists, parachutists would be drop
ped to cut railways and communica
tion lines. They would be followed
by waves of mosquito ships, pro
tected by supporting planes.
Finally, the German high com
mand would strike with transport
ships escorted by air and undersea
fighters. (German troops reached
Norway in this manner.)
No one in Berlin professed to
know (or would admit) the spe
cific part of England on which the
initial blow would fall. Neutral
observers were of the opinion that
while the cliffs of Dover were
nearest to Calais, their heavy de
fenses would probably deter a Ger
man transport fleet at that point.
England's southeastern coastal area
was termed most potential landing
point for possible Gentian blitz
kriegers. Relatively flat and even,
it would prove ideal for a landing
force.
Across the Channel, English de
fenders admitted that danger is.
"real and close at hand."
| ONDON newspapers took an ex-
J tremely grave view of the mili
tary situation on the other side of
the Channel.
Determined to bolster home de
fense with all possible means, the
government named the commander
of British defenders in Norway as
chief of staff of home forces to work
with General Sir Edmund Ironside.

Prominent British spokesmen were
reported as hinting a new counter
offensive along the Channel. The
English drive would be an attempt
to cut the German wedge through
to the Channel.
"It will be 011 a gigantic scale."
they said. They didn't, however,
disclose any further details.
Allied military circlcs still
claimed the English-French-Bel
gian troops within the German
"iron wedge" were in no imme
diate danger. They intimated that
Britain's air force was being
primed for a strong relief role.
As a prelude to any heavy con
centration of a British air fleet, yes
terday London claimed 28 Nazi
planes were downed with a loss of
only five English fighters.
British attacking planes soared
over Belgium and into western Ger
many to inflict heavy damage on
