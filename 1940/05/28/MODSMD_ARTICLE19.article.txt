# Graham Stuart Returns Home
## 
### 
Official circles in Washington are
fearful of a complete German con
quest of the Allies, reports Dr. Gra
ham Stuart, who has just returned
frorp the nation's capital. He attend
ed the Pan-American Scientific
Congress at which President Roose
velt and Secretary of State Hull
spoke.
The overwhelming pro-Ally sym
pathy will probably lead to revision
of the neutrality act so the Allies
may purchase supplies on credit, ac
cording to Dr. Stuart.
The administration appears wor
ried about the attitude of the people,
! particularly to the threat of a Japa
nese coup in the East Indies, Dr. ;
Stuart observed. The government is
aroused but is not, sure of what pol
icy to follow. Nor are the leaders ;
sure that, the people will follow the
policy, for they feel that the people i
do not realize the present danger,
the political science professor added.
Dr. Stuart had a 20-minute confer
| ence with Cordell Hull, but arrived
\ too late to hear the President's ad
dress. Everyone was enthusiastic
over the President's speech, Dr. Stu
art stated. "I heard no criticism un
: til I returned to Stanford.
"I don't tbink the President has
any idea of getting us into a war,
except, to protect America's inter
est; no battle will be fought for any
other reason."
Dr. Stuart observed that the
! South Americas are very much
1 afraid of a Nazi "Fifth Column," and
that they are willing to co-operate
100 per cont with the United States.
; He found no evidence that Roose-
I velt has decided upon a third term.
Dr. Stuart read a paper before a
section of the Congress. He repre
sented Stanford University.
