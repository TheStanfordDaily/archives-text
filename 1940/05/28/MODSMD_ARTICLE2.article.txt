# Series Shows Documentary U.S. Movies
## Education Professor To Introduce Films On Tuesday Lecture 
### RUTH RICHMOND 
"The City" and "The Movie
Marches On," two documentary
films, will be presented tonight at
7:30 o'clock in Memorial Hall on
the last Tuesday Evening Series
program of the quarter.
Giving a brief comment on what
the documentary films are, their
aims, early attempts to make them,
and their development in Russia and
England during the twenties, Dan
iel M. Mendelowitz, assistant pro
fessor of art and education, will give
a 10-minute introduction.
The most publicized beginnings of
the documentary films were made in
England in the early 19305. Since
then they have become important to
governmental agencies, business
groups, and other organizations
who sponsor educational programs.
U.S. WAS BEHIND
Until the films "The Plow That
Broke the Plains" and "The River"
were released, this country was far
behind Europe in the development
of the documentary films. "The
March of Time" films, however,
were among the first successful ex
periments in adapting the docu
mentary film to the news reels.
Today the serious fictional films
reflect the influence in style of these
movies which have provided oppor
tunities for experiments in film
techniques.
The work being done to make a
complete history of the motion pic
ture at the Museum of Modern Art
Film Library in New York is pic
tured in the "March of Time" film,
"The Movie Marches On."
CARNEGIE HELPS
Made possible by a grant from
Carnegie Corporation of New York
and sponsored by the American In
stitute of Planners, "The City" de
picts the problem of the modern city
and offers a solution in the form of
shots taken of many small planned
communities throughout the United
States.
"The City" was photographed and
directed by Ralph Steiner and Wil
lard Van Dyke, the scenario was by
Henwar Rodakiewicz, and the orig
inal outline was by Pare Lorentz.
The author of "The Culture of the
Cities," Lewis Mumford, wrote the
commentary, which gives his ideas
of the way in which, from a socio
logical point of view, he believes our
cities should be planned.

Opening with a study of rural
communities with its dirt roads and
leasurely tempo, the picture shifts
to a crowded tenament district with
its traffic dangers and noisy confu
sion. The "Planned Cities" sum up
the film's theme and represent the
living places of tomorrow.
