# BELGIAN KING SURRENDERS ARMY
## Allies Report Successful Counter-Attacks Against German Lines in Belgium French-British Thrusts Inaugurate Plan to Rout Nazis from Channel; 'Most Decisive-Battle' in Offing BULLETIN 
### United Press 
PARIS, Tuts., May 2X (UP). —Premier Paul Keynaud told the French
nation today that King Ix'opold of the Belgians, without consulting the
British and French and in opposition to his government, had ordered his
army to lay down its arms at 4 a.m. today (9 p.m. Monday CST).
The capitulation, it was said, opened the way for the Germans toward
Dunkirk, one of two Channel ports directly opposite the English coast.
General Maximc YVeygand, Allied commander in chief, has laid down
a new line along the Somme and Aisne Rivers in preparation for a frontal
hattle with the mass of the German army, it was understood.

British and French armies Monday night reported successful counter
blows against the German blitzkrieg 011 two Flanders hattlefronts, in prep
aration for a "gigantic" Allied counter-offensive aimed at blasting the
Nazis out of France's Channel ports.
The counter-offensive, by which the Allies hope to turn the tide of an
admitted disaster, may well prove to be the decisive battle of the war

'because the British and French com
mands are counting upon it to break
the backbone of Adolf Hitler's war
machine.
If it succeeds Hitler may bo
thwarted in carrying out his threat
ened invasion of the British Isles. If
it fails, the terrors of the blitzkrieg
may be upon the British people.
NAZIS 'RECKLESS'
The two British-French advances
followed furious German attacks,
said by the French to have been
ordered by Hitler in utter disregard
for loss of life, in an effort to wipe
out the isolated Allied army of
11,000,000 men north of the Somme
before the Allies can unleash their
counter-offensive.
It appeared Hitler's armies were
paying a tremendous price In an
effort to keep their offensive from
stalling. British pilots, returning
from bombing raids deep into Ger
man territory, told of seeing Ger
man dead piled in "mountainous
heaps" on the Flanders fields of
battle.
FRENCH ADVANCE
The main French army along the
Somme River, which probably will
play a leading role when the Allied
counter-offensive comes, was re
ported by Ihe French high command
to have pushed the Germans back
along an 80-rnile front from the Eng
lish Channel to Saint Quentin, cap
turing villages and slicing deeper
into the German corridor to the sea.
This advance, the French said, was
a preparatory action designed to
straighten the Allied battle line for
the big push.
The Germans disputed these Allied
claims and said that, instead of hold
ing firm, the British around Courtrai
were fighting a desperate rear guard
action intended to cover their flight
back across the Channel to the
British Isles—if they are able to
escape.
FLIGHT NEAR?
Allied troopships have been sighted
in the Belgian harbors waiting to
embark the British forces, the Ger
mans claimed.
In order to block the escape of
the British by sea the Germans
claimed to be subjecting the Chan
nel ports of Dunkerque, Ostend, Zee
brugge and others to terrific aerial
bombardment. The Allied planes
retaliated by blasting at the Ger
man-seized ports.
The Nazis talked loudly of their
I plans for invasion of the British
I Isles —by bombing planes, trans
j ports, parachutists, submarines and
j speedboats and a new "secret wca-
