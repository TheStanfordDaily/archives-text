## Stanford President Speaks at '40 Fair's First 'Special Day' 
### 
A warning that the treaty-makers
a I the end of this war must make
peace "with a different idea than
that of destroying each other" was
voiced by Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur at
an address yesterday at the Golden
Gate International Exposition.
Tiie program, sponsored by the
International Business Machines
Corporation, was broadcast nation
ally over the Mutual network and
included a song recital by Grace
Moore and Lawrence Tibbett, Metro

"We must build with the idea of
helping each other," Dr. Wilbur
said. "This may sound idealistic, but
unless we are idealistic, we will
continue to grovel in trenches and
murder each other under the guise
of patriotism.
"If we can succeed, even in a minor
degree, in developing a world con
ception of the smallness of this
sphere on which we live and of our
present responsibility to make life
upon it as wholesome as possible,
there is a better chance of facili
tating the approach and maintenance
of that stake of affairs which we
know as 'peace' than any other way
of which I can think."
Other speakers on the first of the
Fair's "special day" programs were
Thomas W. Watson, president of In
ternational Business Machines, and
Dr. Aurelia H. Keinhardt, president
of Mills College.
