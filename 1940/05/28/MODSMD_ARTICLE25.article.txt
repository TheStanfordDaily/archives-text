# Farm junior Earns Expenses By Grinding Rock Fragments
## 
### JEFF LITTLEBOY 
Add to your list of strange ways to help yourself through school the
occupation of Robert Love. Bob grinds pieces of rock into the thinnest of
fragments—three-hundredths of a millimeter thick, to he exact. This is
similar to the ham served in boarding houses, which is cut so thin it
often blows away.
Bob, who is studying to be a mining engineer, is from Tacoma, Wash.

He first got interested in '-ock grind-4
ing when he was taking Geology 1
from Professor A. C. Clements. The
latter called for volunteers to learn
the process, so Bob stepped up and
landed the job.
The idea back of the process is to
aid students in geology, crystallog
raphy, and petrography courses in
their knowledge of rock structure
and composition.
CORP YARD DREAM
The grinder itself was built in the I
Corp Yard and is a waist-high,
table-like structure with two grind
ing wheels made of carborundum

upon it. The wheels are powered
by a small electric motor concealed
inside it. The operator takes a piece
of rock about the size of your thumb
and holds it against the first or
roughing grinder. After grinding
enough rock off to make both sides
parallel, or as soon as the rock is
approximately an eighth of an inch
thick, the tricky part of the process
comes into view.
This consists of placing the rock
sliver on a hot plate ,warming it
thoroughly, and then sticking it on
a glass microscope slide with Can
ada Balsam. Slide and rock sliver
are then placed against the second
grinder, which is of finer quality
abrasive than the first, and ground
to the required size. The finishing
touches are put on by rubbing the
stone against a glass plate over
which a still finer abrasive has been
dusted.
JUST LIKE BLOOD
By this time, the piece of stone
must be checked for size in a micro
scope, through the medium of two
plates of polarized glass. If the feld
spar in the rock shows through as a
sort of yellowish-white color, the
rock is the correct size. To the
naked eye, it looks remarkably like
the ordinary lab microscope slide
with a blood smear upon it.
Bob learned the grinding process
from Alex Tihonravov, technical
assistant in geology, who has been
in the department for 15 years and
is the real master of the machine.
EXCELLENT PAY
Some of the undergraduates who
take to the grinding technique can
make as much as 75 cents an hour,
which Bob has made himself on
good days.
Bob figures to keep the job until
he graduates (he is now a junior),
and imagines he'll have as good a
background as any other embryo
engineer, all from his rock grinding
days on the Farm.

A tribe of South American In
dians, the Octomacas, have a mar
riage system under which all girls
are married to old widowers and all
boys to old widows.

Add to your list of strange ways to help yourself through school the
occupation of Robert Love. Bob grinds pieces of rock into the thinnest of
fragments—three-hundredths of a millimeter thick, to he exact. This is
similar to the ham served in boarding houses, which is cut so thin it
often blows away.
Bob, who is studying to be a mining engineer, is from Tacoma, Wash.

He first got interested in '-ock grind-4
ing when he was taking Geology 1
from Professor A. C. Clements. The
latter called for volunteers to learn
the process, so Bob stepped up and
landed the job.
The idea back of the process is to
aid students in geology, crystallog
raphy, and petrography courses in
their knowledge of rock structure
and composition.
CORP YARD DREAM
The grinder itself was built in the I
Corp Yard and is a waist-high,
table-like structure with two grind
ing wheels made of carborundum

upon it. The wheels are powered
by a small electric motor concealed
inside it. The operator takes a piece
of rock about the size of your thumb
and holds it against the first or
roughing grinder. After grinding
enough rock off to make both sides
parallel, or as soon as the rock is
approximately an eighth of an inch
thick, the tricky part of the process
comes into view.
This consists of placing the rock
sliver on a hot plate ,warming it
thoroughly, and then sticking it on
a glass microscope slide with Can
ada Balsam. Slide and rock sliver
are then placed against the second
grinder, which is of finer quality
abrasive than the first, and ground
to the required size. The finishing
touches are put on by rubbing the
stone against a glass plate over
which a still finer abrasive has been
dusted.
JUST LIKE BLOOD
By this time, the piece of stone
must be checked for size in a micro
scope, through the medium of two
plates of polarized glass. If the feld
spar in the rock shows through as a
sort of yellowish-white color, the
rock is the correct size. To the
naked eye, it looks remarkably like
the ordinary lab microscope slide
with a blood smear upon it.
Bob learned the grinding process
from Alex Tihonravov, technical
assistant in geology, who has been
in the department for 15 years and
is the real master of the machine.
EXCELLENT PAY
Some of the undergraduates who
take to the grinding technique can
make as much as 75 cents an hour,
which Bob has made himself on
good days.
Bob figures to keep the job until
he graduates (he is now a junior),
and imagines he'll have as good a
background as any other embryo
engineer, all from his rock grinding
days on the Farm.
