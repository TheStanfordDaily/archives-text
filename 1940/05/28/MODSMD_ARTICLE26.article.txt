# Curtain Rises Tomorrow On 'Three Sisters'
## 
### 
Tomorrow night at 8:15 o'clock the
curtain will rise on the last of the
campus productions for the year
1939-40, when "The Three Sisters,"
by Anton Chekhov, opens for a
three-night run in the Little Thea
ter.
In this play Chekhov wrote of the
life in a small Russian provincial
city. He attempts here to illustrate
that there is a plot in most every
day occurrences of the average per
son's life. "The Three Sisters" is
the story of three Russian girls who
dream of going to Moscow, and
what happens to them when their
dreams are not realized.
The play opens when a regiment
of Russian infantry is quartered in
the village for the first time. The
colonel of the regiment, Vershinen
(Asher Wilson), falls in love with
the second of the three sisters, Ma
sha (Mitzi Hinds), who is already
married to the school-teacher Kuli
gan (Robert Toombs). The colonel
' is already married.
COMPLICATING LOVE
Two of ths soldiers, Tusenbach
1 (J. Edwin Arnold) and Solyony
: (Dick Glyer) fall in love with the
! youngest sister. Irena (Millie Green),
I and complications ensue. The oldest
|of the three sisters, Olga (Serena
Frankel), gradually sees herself be
! coming an old maid, and Chekhov
j treats this development interestingly.
The three sisters live with their
brother Andrey (Ted Marcuse) and
his wife Natasha (Eloise Lambert),
who is pushing the others out of
their recognized places in the house
hold. All these forces pulling against
one another combine to make a
j potent story out of the seemingly
| commonplace, existence of these
people.
FITTING CLIMAX
F. Cowles Strickland, director of
the production, feels that Chekhov
will prove a fitting climax to the
year's activities in the theater. He
| has the beginnings of a group nu
' eleus in the actors he has cast in the
play, and Chekhov needs teamwork
in production according to him.
"Chekhov acts better than he
reads, and contrary to most opinion
that his plays are unpopular, Che
khov productions have always been
successful in this country," Mr.
Strickland declared.

1939-40, when "The Three Sisters,"
by Anton Chekhov, opens for a
three-night run in the Little Thea
ter.
In this play Chekhov wrote of the
life in a small Russian provincial
city. He attempts here to illustrate
that there is a plot in most every
day occurrences of the average per
son's life. "The Three Sisters" is
the story of three Russian girls who
dream of going to Moscow, and
what happens to them when their
dreams are not realized.
The play opens when a regiment
of Russian infantry is quartered in
the village for the first time. The
colonel of the regiment, Vershinen
(Asher Wilson), falls in love with
the second of the three sisters, Ma
sha (Mitzi Hinds), who is already
married to the school-teacher Kuli
gan (Robert Toombs). The colonel
' is already married.
COMPLICATING LOVE
Two of ths soldiers, Tusenbach
1 (J. Edwin Arnold) and Solyony
: (Dick Glyer) fall in love with the
! youngest sister. Irena (Millie Green),
I and complications ensue. The oldest
|of the three sisters, Olga (Serena
Frankel), gradually sees herself be
! coming an old maid, and Chekhov
j treats this development interestingly.
The three sisters live with their
brother Andrey (Ted Marcuse) and
his wife Natasha (Eloise Lambert),
who is pushing the others out of
their recognized places in the house
hold. All these forces pulling against
one another combine to make a
j potent story out of the seemingly
| commonplace, existence of these
people.
FITTING CLIMAX
F. Cowles Strickland, director of
the production, feels that Chekhov
will prove a fitting climax to the
year's activities in the theater. He
| has the beginnings of a group nu
' eleus in the actors he has cast in the
play, and Chekhov needs teamwork
in production according to him.
"Chekhov acts better than he
reads, and contrary to most opinion
that his plays are unpopular, Che
khov productions have always been
successful in this country," Mr.
Strickland declared.
Tomorrow night at 8:15 o'clock the
