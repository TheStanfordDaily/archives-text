### FRANK GUTHRIE 
There is an anomaly in the point
scoring system used by the Pacific
Coast Conference in its champion
ship meet which should be corrected.
We don't want to use that argument
as a reason for our defeat in Los
Angeles, 54-53, Saturday, but if the
scoring ratio were changed there
would be no arguments in the fu
ture over the right of the winner to
claim the championship.
The Trojans won not on their
first place strength but on the basis
of just a few more seconds, thirds,
fourths and fifths than Stanford
had. Where the Indians had five
firsts, the Trojans had only three,
and even lowly Washington State

managed to get four hlue rib
bons.
The present scoring is based on
5-4-3-2-1, and with that ratio the
strong second and third-place team
can more than oflset the winner's
five points in every case. If the ra
tio were 10-6-4-3-2, there would be
a more equitable distribution of
points.

ART ROSENBAUM, one of the
Bay sport scribblers, figured that on
that basis, the Indians would have
won 92 to 85, instead of the two
point defeat.
Most other championships rec
ognize the 10 points for first and
only six for second place. The
Fresno Relays are run off on that
score as in the N.C.A.A. and the
Eastern Relays.
It is generally recognized in the
East that the first place should be
given enough points so that seconds
and thirds together can't offset it.
In previous P.C.C. champion-"
ships, the Trojans have dominated
the meets by huge margins â€” Sat
in day's meet being the closest in
a long while. Thus, only after
close meets is it argued that not
enough points were given for tak
ing first in an event.
In order to mend that system, the
P.C.C. should change the scoring at
their earliest convenience. I dare
say all the coaches would favor the
rule, and if there is to be a clear-cut
victory it will come about by this
new scoring and there would be no
after-the-meet ''ifs" and "buts."

THE HAPPIEST MAN in Los An
geles after Saturday's meet was Bill
Ellington. Or at least he was sad
until his fellow coaches honored
him with charge of the P.C.C. forces
in the forthcoming P.C.C.-Big Ten
track meet.
This marks the second honor Bill
has been given this year. The other
was his being named honorary ref
eree at the Compton Invitational,
June 6.

NINE STANFORDS will have
their way paid with Happy Bill to
the Big Ten-P.C.C. dual meet.
