The Seattle Rainiers held their
league leadership today by a mar
gin of two games after a week of
upsets that changed (lie entire
pattern of the league's first divi
sion.
The rampaging Rainiers trimmed j
Oakland, six games to one, during '
(heir week's series and crowded into |
the top spot in front of both San i
Diego, the previous leaders, and the
Oaks. The Oaks dropped into fourth
spot and San Diego into second
place. $
Perhaps the most remarkable im
provement was shown by the San
Francisco Seals, who trounced San
Diego five games to one in a sur
prising reversal of form that carried
the O'Doulrnen from fifth place into
third place at the expense of Oakland
and Hollywood.
Oakland and Hollywood now were
tied lor fourth place one-half game
behind the Seals.

north to attempt to block Seattle's
onward march, while San Diego en
counters the Los Angeles Angels,
who edged out Sacramento 4 to 3
in their last week's series.
