# Ellington Names Wulff, Clark to Join Eastbound Trek of Card Trackmen
## 
### 
Kuss Wulff. hi√üh jumper. and Ernie Clark, quarter-miler and relay
num. have been named by Track Coach Hill Ellington to round out Stan
ford's eastbound cinder team.
Nine other Cards have earned a trip to Evanston. HI., for the Pacific
Coast Conference-Big Ten All-Stars meet to lie held on June 17. By

either first, second, or third
I in the P.C.C. meet Saturday Captain
Clyde Jeffrey, Craig Williamson,
Charlie Shaw, Paul Moore, Dick
Simpson, Stan Andersen, Bill Trout,
Arnold Cornett, and Bob Kenyon
captured a berth on the Coast squad.
The university is sending these
! added two men to augment the In
: dip.n team which will enter the Na
tional Collegiates in Minneapolis on
i June 21 and 22. It will be Ellington
and Company's last crack at the
mighty Trojans and it looks as
! though Stanford, because of the em
phasis on individual brilliance in
stead of team depth, should even
| the year's score with U.S.C.
JUMPS TO TIE
Wulff high-jumped into a four
way tie for second place in the Con
ference meet at 6 ft. 4 in. but lost
in the jump-off to determine places
on the Coast team. Russ has been
: particularly consistent this year at
: about this height, and if he gets as
j hot as he was in the Big Meet he may
! grab some much needed points in
the Nationals,
Clark is one of Ellington's trio of
flying quarter-milers and a member
i of the world-record mile relay team.
Ernie was so badly boxed and al
most run over by Ucla's hefty Tom
Bradley last Saturday at Los An
geles that he was forced to break
his stride several times and thus
finished out of the money. Yet Ernie,
who was the Big Meet winner over
his teammates, Williamson and
Shaw, and Cal's swift Clarence
Barnes, is capable of better than 48
seconds flat and may easily place at
Minneapolis.
ONE POINT AWAY
| Final and official viewing of mov
j ies of the finishes of all the close
j races put Stanford's track team to
; within only one point of victory in
last week-end's now doubly heart-
I breaking Coast Conference Meet.
Pictures of the finish of the 100-yard
dash proved that U.C.L.A.'s sepia
speedster, Hal Sinclair, nosed out
Troy's "Tricey Mickey" Anderson
by inches for second place behind
Clyde Jeffrey. This knocked a point
off U.S.C.'s total, leaving them in first
place by a scant one-point margin.
One of Stanford's trackmen started
yesterday to indicate that the Cards
are going to be the backbone of a
favored Coast, team in the Big Ten
meet and that they are going to take
, the Trojans in the N.C.A.A. Arn
| Cornett made the best throw of his
life as he whirled the discus out 159
feet in a distance which
would have challenged his team
mate, Stan Andersen, for first place
last Saturday.

Human physical decline starts at
age 25.
