rMGHTEEN (lays ago, Oil May 10. tin* legions of
Adolf Hitler Masted their way into Holland and
Belgium. Since that date, they have success fully
invaded northern France and have sped in a slim
column to the Channel ports of Boulogne and Ca
lais. There. llic\ propose an invasion of England.
The American people, taking their information
from the headlines on street-sale newspapers, be
lieve the end is near for the Allies. The news has
I teen a tale of one Nazi victory after another; of
repealed bungling by the armies ol the democracies.
The obvious conclusion is that Creat Britain is fac
ing a sure destruction.
Perhaps this is correct, hut a feu as yet unpubli
ci/.cd factors should he considered, just for the
record.
The immediate proposal of the Cerinan high com
mand is that dreaded attack on English shores. Is
this feasible? A nation with organized defenses
cannot he taken l>\ parachute troops; therefore the
Nazis must come by water. To transport an army
sufficient to conquer Creat Britain, say 500,000
men, would require about 500 troopships. The im
mense problem of running those 500 ships through
the entire British navy and past air and coastal
defenses —and especially the problem of getting that
man) ships—is patently enormous.
Oerman victories on continental Europe can stand
;i little reconsidering, too. In the German army,
weight has been sacrificed for speed. Whether mo
torized columns can hold the Channel coast, whether
those columns can sustain their narrow length
against an organized attack by a huge army, is
problematical.
I here is a furious intensity to the Cerinan at
tacks. \es. But there seems also to be a sort of
furious desperation. Germany is fighting against
time as much as against the French and the British.
No one knows what resources she has in store, but
that any one nation can long sustain the terrific loss
in material and man-power that is encountered in
a Irenzied attack is unlikely.
Ihe Allies are not beaten. They are retreating,
they have suffered serious casualties. But they still
ha\e a navy, their air force is felt with increasing
power In Germany, and they still have the keys to
most ol the world's petroleum and much of its iron
and food.
And here it had better be said this is no plea for
support of England and France—it is merely a plea
h>r straight thinking.—J. B.
