Daily associate editors went on a '"bat last
night somewhere in the environs of San Fran
cisco.
I hey will he back on the campus loda\ to vote in
llic semi-annual election that will make one of them
llic editor of Volume 90. for the first half of the
academic year 1940-41. Ihe loser can point to
three swell competitive years behind him and then
contemplate one more season of rival-free work and
play on the same Daily. Ihe days of the shunned
losing candidate are gone from the Shack forever.
Hut probably more important in a world as
troubled as Ihi s mixed-up orb of ours is the question
ol just what the new editor will have on his hands
w hen fall quarter does finally roll around.
\ll lliis forecasting, of course, is largeh depend
ent on the mode in which the I nited Slates main
lains her neutrality in the next three months.
Ordinarily a Daily editor has his hands filled con
duet ing campus campaigns, lambasting those who
need lambasting, and praising those who deserve
praise all in the realm of the college proper.
Now that sometimes petty, oftentimes seemingly
serious college journalism has been discarded.
\merican youth is frankly worried about a lot big
ger campaign than any which they have ever seen
in their comparatively mild college days. It will
be interesting to follow tin* trends of the new col
lege editors after certain alien and domestic propa
ganda machines get I heir big campaigns under way
in lht> summer months.
May the new Stanford editor be entrenched with
the horrors and uselessness of war and with the
knowledge that there are no atrocities in war except
war itself.
