## ALREADY INVADED 
### 
r |MIE EDITOR. SIR:
We wish to answer herewith the letter to you of
May 22, 1040, signed by Two Brothers in the Bund
and all other Fifth Column advocates.
First., the Bundite letter is so full of inaccuracies
and contradictions it answers itself. Note the second
paragraph which states that Nationalism is the major
cause of European discord, and in a following sentence
it says that German totalitarianism was fostered to
promote German Nationalism. In other words, ihe
Bundites admit German aggression the cause of the
war.
Second, the Bundites state that a German victory
would he of greater benefit to humanity than an Allied
triumph. This statement is in line with well known
German propaganda everywhere, and is contrary to
the bona fide reports of horror, slavery and annihila
tion practiced upon the peoples of every invaded coun
try. Such reports and warnings to the United States
have come from persons high in the Nazi party such
as Fritz Thvssen and Hermann Rauschning. The lat
ter writes as follows, "The Nazi rulers have one pro

gram, POWER: one plan, PLUNDER; and on tactic,
TERROR. They plan to make Germany a base from
which to conquer the entire world. The Nazi social
order will consist of a blind obedicnce to an absolute
despotism, a progressive economic destruction of the
middle class, and the all prevailing atmosphere of bar
racks and prisons, impoverishment, regimentation, and
the collapse of all civilized existence."

'T'HIRD, the Two Brothers in the Bund say that a
German victory would benefit the United States
economically. This statement is ridiculous in view
of the fact that Germany is making slaves of the con
quered peoples who are being forced to work for poor
food and clothing and no money. How the United
States could compete with this the Bundites fail to
disclose.
As has been so aptly stated by a nationally known
radio commentator, "One fool is worth two Benedict
Arnolds." The dictators also know this to be true.
In closing we wish to quote Mr. Hitler and Mr.
Goebbels through Hermann Rauschnmg in his book,
"The Voice of Destruction." Mr. Goebbels says, "Noth
ing will be easier than to produce a bloody revolution
in North America. The America of today will never
again be a danger to us." Mr. Hitler states, "War is the
most natural, the most every-day matter. War is eter
nal, war is universal. What is war but cunning, decep
tion, delusion, attack and surprise. What is the object
of war? To make the enemy capitulate. If he does ,1
have the prospect of wiping him out."
