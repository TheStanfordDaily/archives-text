## BROTHERS IN BLOOD 
### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
I REMEMBER a great chain of ants in our garage
that used to stream out of a crack in the concrete
and swarm across the floor. It used to be interesting
to watch their reactions in the face of a super-ant at
tack. Fire would make them rush around like frenzied
madmen, and some would escape, and some would
shrivel up and die. Water would make those ants kick
and fight and struggle against a force 50 million times
their own, and some of them would escape, and some
of them would drown.
The ants kept coming in orderly foi*mation, though,
except where the lines were broken. They were as
helpless as straws in the wind, and all they could do
was to follow one another and to struggle.
There are a lot of ants in Europe now, as helpless
as the ants in our garage. They are German, French,
Belgian ants, and they follow one another and struggle,
while a force greater than their own tortures and de
ceives them.
But we like to think that each man is intellectually
independent, each in his own mind. Like ants physic
ally, perhaps, but like Gods mentally—that is what we
like to think. But the individual human brains are as
helpless, as regimented, and as futile as the ants; they
follow one another and they struggle.
In 1917 Robert Bridges, a sentimental poet, wrote
things like this:
"Brothers in Blood. . . . Transform the earth . . .
In the vision of Beauty and the Spirit's law,
Freedom and Honor and sweet Lovingkindness."

r corpses-elect follow like ants, and their brains
think things like that. As helpless as their British
and French foes, the common German soldier thinks
of glory and the honor of Deutschland. And the British
and French soldiers think of glory and the honor of
England and France. And they all suffer—helplessly
and without constructive effect.
And after the war, some of the ants will think of
their agonies instead of their glories. Maybe some of
them will write with the bitterness that, a British cap
tain used after the last war. Siegfried Sassoon asked:
"Does it matter?—losing your sight? . . .
There's such splendid work for the blind;
And people will always be kind . . .
For they'll know that you've fought for your
country,
And no one will worry a bit."
That's the sort of thing with which the Nazi spear
head is forged, and that's the sort of thing that makes
the Allied counterattack. But now people think of the
spearhead and the counterattack, and they forget the
helpless ants whose arms and legs and heads are cheap.
I used to wonder why these ants kept coming end
lessly, out of the crack in the concrete.
