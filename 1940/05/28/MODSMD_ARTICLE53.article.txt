## R.O.T.C. AT STANFORD Professor of Military Science and Tactics 
### MAJOR HARRY B. ALLEN 
r pHE R.O.T.C. consists of students in schools, colleges,
and universities receiving military training under
the supervision of the War Department.
The purpose of the courses of instruction i.s pri
marily to qualify students for positions of leadership
in the military forces of the United States in time of
national emergency. A secondary object is to provide
the nation with college graduates correctly informed
as to the purpose and necessity of our national defense
policy.
R.O.T.C. units of the combat arms and services are
assigned to various schools in which the tactics and
technique of the particular arm is taught. Stanford
is one of 28 universities which have Field Artillery
units, and in addition it has an Ordnance Unit.
There is frequently misapprehension as to the status
of a member of the R.O.T.C. It should be clearly un
derstood that an R.O.T.C. student is not in the army.
His legal obligations are no greater than those of any
other citizen. He does, however, prepare himself so
that in case of national emergency, he may serve in a
position of leadership as a commissioned officer. This
objective is reached without interference with the aca
demic work of the student during his college years.

PRIME purpose of higher education is to train men
for positions of leadership and responsibility. A
broad, well-balanced education fits a man to fill effi
ciently positions of responsibility, both public and
private, in war as well as in peace.
The R.O.T.C. students constitute a group the least
likely to be militaristic in the undesirable sense, while
at the same time their general intelligence is such as
to make them most valuable in the event that they
should be required for national defense.
The military courses provide training in organiza
tion, command, and leadership which is of proven value
ot young men entering business and industry. They
have learned the value of teamwork and that there is
no subservience nor loss of dignity on the part of
those who are obeying the commands of those in au
thority. We find this carries over into commercial and
.industrial life, and develops an entirely different atti
tude on the part of both the business executive and
those who are in his organization.
The students of today hold in their hands the future
welfare and security of our countrv.
