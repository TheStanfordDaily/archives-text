"WATERLOO BRIDGE," with Viv
ien Leigh and Robert Taylor.
Stalling with a distinguished look
ing middle-aged man (you know it's
Taylor) standing alone with his
memories on Waterloo Bridge, this
melodramatic yarn of love and war
presents Vivien Leigh and Robert
Taylor as a couple of star-crossed
lovers in the 1914 way.
It's an old story but it's by Rob
ert E. Sherwood and he tells it with
suspense.
It seems that the middle-aged man
is off to fight the Germans in the
present war, and he's spending his
last evening with his memories of
1914 on Waterloo Bridge. The
memory is Vivien Leigh—and that's
the story. They met on the bridge
during an air raid and love flow
ered on leave.
But the war separated them. She
thought that he'd been killed, and
she was starving so she became a
prostitute. She was starving! Then
he returned, took her back, but her
conscience wouldn't let her become
a dishonest bride, so she committed
a lady-like suicide—in front of a
truck. He never forgets her.
Aided by excellent camera work
and a beautiful score, "Waterloo
Bridge" is one of the finest pictures
of the year. It's war without propa
ganda. You can just sit and watch
Miss Leigh smile, Mr. Taylor kiss,
maybe cry a little and leave the
theater still neutral.—Saroyan
