# June Chappie To Be Mystery
## 'Old Boy' Promises Plenty of Drawings 
### 
To finish the year Chaparral will
come out June 15 with a surprise
issue, Old Boy Marco Thorne de
clared yesterday that is a complete
mystery.

"Unknown, secret, mystery to ev
erybody, to the staff, to me," Thorne
said. "Men with guns have kept on
lookers out, and quiet industry pre
vails in the office. Whole staff put
it out," he added.

The cover, a surprise, too, has been
seen by only Marco and by Doris
Tucker and Barney McClure, who
drew it.

The issue, which contains more
drawings than any Chappie has had
before, were made by the entire
artist staff, which avers that it has
no idea of what or why it is drawing.
Those employed were Doris Tucker,
Barney McClure, John Elliot, Aitch
Elliott, Dolores Thornton, Janice
Hyatt, Frank Hewitt, Jim Walker,
Jack Hurt, Bob Rieser, and Ciaire
Burtchaell.

Copy writers for the June number
were Jim Raynes, Ed Hutshing,
Terry Green, Sewall Brown, Ben
Parkinson, Guy Wiggins, Karl Bled
soe, Louis Means, Rea Calvert,
Richard Taylor, and others.

Special meetings with new and old
talent for next year's Chappies will
be held this week. All interested in
selling advertising for the magazine
may meet Louis Means, business
manager for Volume 42, in his office
in the Journalism Building Wednes
day afternoon. Tryoutees for liter
ary or art staffs are to meet Thurs
day afternoon in the editorial
