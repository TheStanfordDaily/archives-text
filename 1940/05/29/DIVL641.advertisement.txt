DISTRESS J|M
NERVE STRAIN— m I
MENTAL ANGTSSH
Doctors and their social duties some* \ 11/ -/
times have a hard time making con- /A
nections, and often are the despair \
of their family and friends. I
It may not be generally thought that II
the modern Doctor takes the case of
the patient as much to heart as the old family physician,
but those who live close to Doctors will tell you a different
story. The Physician who tries to divert his mind, or
fulfill social obligations, with a seriously iil patient in his
thoughts, is a very absent-minded theatre companion or
bridge partner.
The Doctor expecting a momentary summons, is not free
from mental strain or wakeful nights. When he finds the
case beyond human or scientific help, only the immediate
family grieves more than the Doctor. Of course it is up to
the Doctor not to show distress, and to keep nerve strain
under leash, but modern Phy»
JBB f sicians take their profession
seriously, and want just aa
flr, sincerely to make and keep you
m* well as the old-fashioned
- general practioner.
Get acquainted with your Doctor.
