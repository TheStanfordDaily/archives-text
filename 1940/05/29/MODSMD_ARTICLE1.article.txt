History 1!)40 sidesteps
into three months of oblivion as
The Stanford Daily eases into a sum
mer of rest and a change of pas
tures.
But here in America, across the
Atlantic in war-torn Europe, and
above the bloody far-Eastern battle
grounds, History will still be made.
Writing in a period which will
live in every history book for years
to come, this year's History 1940
was necessarily filled with new
found words and newly used
phrases. The parachutists, the i
blitzkrieg, "fifth columns" and the j
like were forced into common usage
by an iron-fisted German chancel
lor.
And the handwriting on the wall
for at least the next three months
will be from the pen of that Ger
man Fuehrer. Adolpli Hitler, ex
corporal, is the most feared and
most respected man in our hemi
sphere.
While governments in England
and France tottered and fell, the
Austrian sonuva shoemaker re
tained his iron grip upon the destiny
of his empire.
"Empire" was a word which
Versailles treatyists believed would
never again be applied to Germany.
But the* story of Versailles and the
story of Hitler's Germany went their
several ways.
the moment in 1936 when
England allowed the occupation
of the Rhineland the "go" signal
was evergreen for the Reich. From
that time on, the though of failure
was repugnant and impossible for
those in Berlin's inner circle.
This year, profiting from the
Russo-Finnish lesson, Germany
proved that modern concrete block
houses were not invulnerable. In
vading the Low Countries in an
adaptation of 1914's "SchliefTen plan,"
the blitzkrieg forces pushed deep
inlo France, wedged their way to
the Channel coast.
"Never in World War I was
England in so precarious a posi
tion as she is now," said Lloyd
George in a Parliamentary debate.
Never in his life did Lloyd George
utter a more poignant statement.
Yesterday, today, and tomorrow
England lives in mortal fear of a
raid on "impregnable" Britain. lEng
land's boast to invincibility, of 900
years' standing, seems doomed be
fore this year is over.
Across the Atlantic seethes Amer
ica, neutral of neutrals, which fer
vently believes and hopes for peace.
A Rooseveltian move short weeks
ago moved America into top-ranking
air strength, as Congress rubber
stamped a Presidential plea for
50,000 more planes before ihe end of
the year.

I DUPLICATING her enigmatic
role of 1914, Italy again holds
the enviable position of the most
sought-after ally in Europe. For the
first seven months of World War II
Mussolini kept arms folded in a
stand-offish position.
But during past weeks, Mussolini
kept the Rome-Berlin axis well
greased. With anti-Ally pressure in
creasing in what was Rome, Italian
statesmen seemingly joined hands
with Berlin in an under the table
gesture of friendship.
Down in the Balkans, powder keg
of the first World War, Italy seem
ingly retained her happy position of
chief friend and mediator. During
past weeks the Balkans threatened
to bite the hand that slapped their
backs, as relations with Italy became
more strained due to a less com
promising Italian attitude.
America slipped non-intcrested

the war to suddenly awake to re
alization (hat World War II was
something more than a bad dream.

Roosevelt would run for a third term.
History 1!)40 sidesteps
into three months of oblivion as
The Stanford Daily eases into a sum
mer of rest and a change of pas
tures.
But here in America, across the
Atlantic in war-torn Europe, and
above the bloody far-Eastern battle
grounds, History will still be made.
Writing in a period which will
live in every history book for years
to come, this year's History 1940
was necessarily filled with new
found words and newly used
phrases. The parachutists, the i
blitzkrieg, "fifth columns" and the j
like were forced into common usage
by an iron-fisted German chancel
lor.
And the handwriting on the wall
for at least the next three months
will be from the pen of that Ger
man Fuehrer. Adolpli Hitler, ex
corporal, is the most feared and
most respected man in our hemi
sphere.
While governments in England
and France tottered and fell, the
Austrian sonuva shoemaker re
tained his iron grip upon the destiny
of his empire.
"Empire" was a word which
Versailles treatyists believed would
never again be applied to Germany.
But the* story of Versailles and the
story of Hitler's Germany went their
several ways.
the moment in 1936 when
England allowed the occupation
of the Rhineland the "go" signal
was evergreen for the Reich. From
that time on, the though of failure
was repugnant and impossible for
those in Berlin's inner circle.
This year, profiting from the
Russo-Finnish lesson, Germany
proved that modern concrete block
houses were not invulnerable. In
vading the Low Countries in an
adaptation of 1914's "SchliefTen plan,"
the blitzkrieg forces pushed deep
inlo France, wedged their way to
the Channel coast.
"Never in World War I was
England in so precarious a posi
tion as she is now," said Lloyd
George in a Parliamentary debate.
Never in his life did Lloyd George
utter a more poignant statement.
Yesterday, today, and tomorrow
England lives in mortal fear of a
raid on "impregnable" Britain. lEng
land's boast to invincibility, of 900
years' standing, seems doomed be
fore this year is over.
Across the Atlantic seethes Amer
ica, neutral of neutrals, which fer
vently believes and hopes for peace.
A Rooseveltian move short weeks
ago moved America into top-ranking
air strength, as Congress rubber
stamped a Presidential plea for
50,000 more planes before ihe end of
the year.

I DUPLICATING her enigmatic
role of 1914, Italy again holds
the enviable position of the most
sought-after ally in Europe. For the
first seven months of World War II
Mussolini kept arms folded in a
stand-offish position.
But during past weeks, Mussolini
kept the Rome-Berlin axis well
greased. With anti-Ally pressure in
creasing in what was Rome, Italian
statesmen seemingly joined hands
with Berlin in an under the table
gesture of friendship.
Down in the Balkans, powder keg
of the first World War, Italy seem
ingly retained her happy position of
chief friend and mediator. During
past weeks the Balkans threatened
to bite the hand that slapped their
backs, as relations with Italy became
more strained due to a less com
promising Italian attitude.
America slipped non-intcrested
ly through the first live months of
the war to suddenly awake to re
alization (hat World War II was
something more than a bad dream.
The had dream turned into a
rarebit and cheese nightmare, but
American neutral leanings made
(lie nation believe it was no more
than a milk-puwh hangover.
Radio reports blasted deep warn
ings of German aflronterics in Bel
gium. But Mr. Average American
yawned, reached for the phone, and
asked his precinct leader whether
Roosevelt would run for a third term.
