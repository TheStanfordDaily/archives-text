# Excom Mops Up Year's Odds, Ends
## Bryan Appointment, Caucus Substitute, New Club Approved 
### DICK DUDMAN 
By DICK DUDMAN

Greyson Bryan became head of
the Stanford Family Council—stu
dent organ of the annual Appeal for
the Stanford Fund—when Ex Com
mittee approved his appointment
yesterday.
The appointment headed an agenda
of odds and ends that Ex Committee
mopped up in preparation for its
last meeting of the year next week.
Other business of the afternoon
meeting follows:
CAUCUS SUBSTITUTE: Women's
Nominating Committee, the succes
sor to the caucus, attained legiti
macy when Ex Committee approved
a by-law presented by Annabclle
Clark, chairman of Women's Con
ference.
, For the last three years, she ex
plained, the nominating board has
been running on an unofficial basis.
The new by-law provides for it
under the Women's Conference con
stitution.
Operating only for women's of
fices, the board has nominated one
or more women for each office al the
regular student body elections. Oth
er persons at all times have been
eligible for independent nomination,
it was explained.
"Was anyone elected at the last
election who wasn't nominated by
the committee?" asked Daily Editor
Arch Jenkins.
"Nobody else ran," Miss Clark
answered.
Mollie West said, "Everyone who
even thought of running came be
fore us."
"Two women not nominated by
the committee ran in the winter
quarter elections, but they both
came in last," said Miss Clark. She
presented several revisions of the
Conference constitution, all of which
were approved.
TOO MANY SWEATERS: Read
ing a letter from Alfred R. Masters,
general manager of the 8.A.C.,
President Ken Cuthbertson explained
that some athletes get three or four
sweaters along with their block "S"
awards—more than they know what
to do with.
He relayed to the committee Mr.
Masters' suggestion that traveling
j jackets be authorized as a substitute
for sweaters after the first award.
Someone asked if that wouldn't
duplicate the traveling jackets al
ready given.
"Conditions at the B.A.C. preclude
the giving of any more traveling
jackets," Cuthbertson answered.
Ross Anderson and Bob Low,
members of next year's Ex Com-
I mittee, were appointed a sub-com
mittee to confer with Mr. Masters on
the subject cither this quarter or
early next fall.
SONS AND DAUGHTERS: The
constitution of the Alumni Sons and
Daughters Club, a new undergrad
uate organization, was approved on
recommendation of M. J. Mont
gomery.
She said the only possible objec
tion to it would be on grounds it
was undemocratic. Committeemen
did not consider this possibility im
portant.
"As long as 500 students are eli
gible for membership, it's not so un
democratic that you could notice it,"
said Mollie West.
SYMPHONY FUNDS: Funds left
in the treasury of the now-defunct
Stanford Symphony Orchestra were
transferred, after a brief discussion,
to the Division of Music, being ear
marked for the division's Palo Alto
Symphony organized this year by
Ferenc Molnar.
It was provided that this disposi
tion must be approved by Albert
Hooper, the man who directed the
old orchestra and donated to it $1,000,
of which $100 remains.
Student Manager John Cobbs in
troduced the matter, pointing out
that the new orchestra is only one
thiid student in its membership.
''But from what 1 understand
they're doin' all right as symphonies
go," he said.
"The question is," he continued,
"do we want to turn it over to the
division's budget when it was do
nated for a student organization?"
Ex Committee decided it did, pend
ing, however, Mr. Hooper's approval.
RIFLE AND PISTOL CLUB: Con
stitution for this organization was
approved.
ELECTION RETURNS: On rec
ommendation of Election Chairmar
Bill Leckie, committeemen approved
returns of Daily and Quad staff elec
] tions.

Greyson Bryan became head of
the Stanford Family Council—stu
dent organ of the annual Appeal for
the Stanford Fund—when Ex Com
mittee approved his appointment
yesterday.
The appointment headed an agenda
of odds and ends that Ex Committee
mopped up in preparation for its
last meeting of the year next week.
Other business of the afternoon
meeting follows:
CAUCUS SUBSTITUTE: Women's
Nominating Committee, the succes
sor to the caucus, attained legiti
macy when Ex Committee approved
a by-law presented by Annabclle
Clark, chairman of Women's Con
ference.
, For the last three years, she ex
plained, the nominating board has
been running on an unofficial basis.
The new by-law provides for it
under the Women's Conference con
stitution.
Operating only for women's of
fices, the board has nominated one
or more women for each office al the
regular student body elections. Oth
er persons at all times have been
eligible for independent nomination,
it was explained.
"Was anyone elected at the last
election who wasn't nominated by
the committee?" asked Daily Editor
Arch Jenkins.
"Nobody else ran," Miss Clark
answered.
Mollie West said, "Everyone who
even thought of running came be
fore us."
"Two women not nominated by
the committee ran in the winter
quarter elections, but they both
came in last," said Miss Clark. She
presented several revisions of the
Conference constitution, all of which
were approved.
TOO MANY SWEATERS: Read
ing a letter from Alfred R. Masters,
general manager of the 8.A.C.,
President Ken Cuthbertson explained
that some athletes get three or four
sweaters along with their block "S"
awards—more than they know what
to do with.
He relayed to the committee Mr.
Masters' suggestion that traveling
j jackets be authorized as a substitute
for sweaters after the first award.
Someone asked if that wouldn't
duplicate the traveling jackets al
ready given.
"Conditions at the B.A.C. preclude
the giving of any more traveling
jackets," Cuthbertson answered.
Ross Anderson and Bob Low,
members of next year's Ex Com-
I mittee, were appointed a sub-com
mittee to confer with Mr. Masters on
the subject cither this quarter or
early next fall.
SONS AND DAUGHTERS: The
constitution of the Alumni Sons and
Daughters Club, a new undergrad
uate organization, was approved on
recommendation of M. J. Mont
gomery.
She said the only possible objec
tion to it would be on grounds it
was undemocratic. Committeemen

"Nobody else ran," Miss Clark
answered.
Mollie West said, "Everyone who
even thought of running came be
fore us."
"Two women not nominated by
the committee ran in the winter
quarter elections, but they both
came in last," said Miss Clark. She
presented several revisions of the
Conference constitution, all of which
were approved.
TOO MANY SWEATERS: Read
ing a letter from Alfred R. Masters,
general manager of the 8.A.C.,
President Ken Cuthbertson explained
that some athletes get three or four
sweaters along with their block "S"
awards—more than they know what
to do with.
He relayed to the committee Mr.
Masters' suggestion that traveling
j jackets be authorized as a substitute
for sweaters after the first award.
Someone asked if that wouldn't
duplicate the traveling jackets al
ready given.
"Conditions at the B.A.C. preclude
the giving of any more traveling
jackets," Cuthbertson answered.
Ross Anderson and Bob Low,
members of next year's Ex Com-
I mittee, were appointed a sub-com
mittee to confer with Mr. Masters on
the subject cither this quarter or
early next fall.
SONS AND DAUGHTERS: The
constitution of the Alumni Sons and
Daughters Club, a new undergrad
uate organization, was approved on
recommendation of M. J. Mont
gomery.
She said the only possible objec
tion to it would be on grounds it
was undemocratic. Committeemen
did not consider this possibility im
portant.
"As long as 500 students are eli
gible for membership, it's not so un
democratic that you could notice it,"
said Mollie West.
SYMPHONY FUNDS: Funds left
in the treasury of the now-defunct
Stanford Symphony Orchestra were
transferred, after a brief discussion,
to the Division of Music, being ear
marked for the division's Palo Alto
Symphony organized this year by
Ferenc Molnar.
It was provided that this disposi
tion must be approved by Albert
Hooper, the man who directed the
old orchestra and donated to it $1,000,
of which $100 remains.
Student Manager John Cobbs in
troduced the matter, pointing out
that the new orchestra is only one
thiid student in its membership.
''But from what 1 understand
they're doin' all right as symphonies
go," he said.
"The question is," he continued,
"do we want to turn it over to the
division's budget when it was do
nated for a student organization?"
Ex Committee decided it did, pend
ing, however, Mr. Hooper's approval.
RIFLE AND PISTOL CLUB: Con
stitution for this organization was
approved.
ELECTION RETURNS: On rec
ommendation of Election Chairmar
Bill Leckie, committeemen approved
returns of Daily and Quad staff elec
] tions.

Greyson Bryan became head of
the Stanford Family Council—stu
dent organ of the annual Appeal for
the Stanford Fund—when Ex Com
mittee approved his appointment
yesterday.
The appointment headed an agenda
of odds and ends that Ex Committee
mopped up in preparation for its
last meeting of the year next week.
Other business of the afternoon
meeting follows:
CAUCUS SUBSTITUTE: Women's
Nominating Committee, the succes
sor to the caucus, attained legiti
macy when Ex Committee approved
a by-law presented by Annabclle
Clark, chairman of Women's Con
ference.
, For the last three years, she ex
plained, the nominating board has
been running on an unofficial basis.
The new by-law provides for it
under the Women's Conference con
stitution.
Operating only for women's of
fices, the board has nominated one
or more women for each office al the
regular student body elections. Oth
er persons at all times have been
eligible for independent nomination,
it was explained.
"Was anyone elected at the last
election who wasn't nominated by
the committee?" asked Daily Editor
Arch Jenkins.
"Nobody else ran," Miss Clark
answered.
Mollie West said, "Everyone who
even thought of running came be
fore us."
"Two women not nominated by
the committee ran in the winter
quarter elections, but they both
came in last," said Miss Clark. She
