By DICK DUDMAN

Greyson Bryan became head of
the Stanford Family Council—stu
dent organ of the annual Appeal for
the Stanford Fund—when Ex Com
mittee approved his appointment
yesterday.
The appointment headed an agenda
of odds and ends that Ex Committee
mopped up in preparation for its
last meeting of the year next week.
Other business of the afternoon
meeting follows:
CAUCUS SUBSTITUTE: Women's
Nominating Committee, the succes
sor to the caucus, attained legiti
macy when Ex Committee approved
a by-law presented by Annabclle
Clark, chairman of Women's Con
ference.
, For the last three years, she ex
plained, the nominating board has
been running on an unofficial basis.
The new by-law provides for it
under the Women's Conference con
stitution.
Operating only for women's of
fices, the board has nominated one
or more women for each office al the
regular student body elections. Oth
er persons at all times have been
eligible for independent nomination,
it was explained.
"Was anyone elected at the last
election who wasn't nominated by
the committee?" asked Daily Editor
Arch Jenkins.
"Nobody else ran," Miss Clark
answered.
Mollie West said, "Everyone who
even thought of running came be
fore us."
"Two women not nominated by
the committee ran in the winter
quarter elections, but they both
came in last," said Miss Clark. She
presented several revisions of the
Conference constitution, all of which
were approved.
TOO MANY SWEATERS: Read
ing a letter from Alfred R. Masters,
general manager of the 8.A.C.,
President Ken Cuthbertson explained
that some athletes get three or four
sweaters along with their block "S"
awards—more than they know what
to do with.
He relayed to the committee Mr.
Masters' suggestion that traveling
j jackets be authorized as a substitute
for sweaters after the first award.
Someone asked if that wouldn't
duplicate the traveling jackets al
ready given.
"Conditions at the B.A.C. preclude
the giving of any more traveling
jackets," Cuthbertson answered.
Ross Anderson and Bob Low,
members of next year's Ex Com-
I mittee, were appointed a sub-com
mittee to confer with Mr. Masters on
the subject cither this quarter or
early next fall.
SONS AND DAUGHTERS: The
constitution of the Alumni Sons and
Daughters Club, a new undergrad
uate organization, was approved on
