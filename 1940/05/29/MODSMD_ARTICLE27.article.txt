# War, Big Game Losses, 3 New Campus Structures Color Class of '40 History
## Tuition Raise Climaxes Stanford Careers; Past Four Years Include Roble Revolt, Farm's Last Mud Fight 
### LARRY LIVINGSTON 
Since the Class of '40 arrived at J
Stanford one warm fall day four j
years ago, the web of world his- |
tory has been spun at so dizzying a
rate that many times events on the !
Kami have been edged into the
shadows.
But still, Stanford has changed in
a good many ways during those J
years, has progressed in some and
regressed in others. Although the
p.ittern is multi-colored and con
fusing, the major trends are unmis- |
takably upward.
Viewed through the spectacles of
local H. G. Wells, the Farm's out
line of history makes this kind of J
picture:
WILD AND WOOLLY
The Class of '40 arrives at Stan
ford to enjoy the advantages of the
first pre-registration period and
spends a wild and woolly first quar
ter—losing the mud fight to the
sophomores, seeing the tradition
abolished forever, staging a riot in
Palo Alto after being refused free
admission to the movie.
A Nitery was built by the A.S.S.U.
ns the great structure of Memorial
Hall rose day by day, and the Frost
Memorial Amphitheater sunk deeper
and deeper behind it.
Stanford was beaten in the first of
four Big Games it was fated to lose
while the Class of '40 was in school
. . . the Division of Speech and
Drama was founded . . . the Con
valescent Home Masque Ball king
queen contest was abolished because
it wasn't democratic.
By the end of the first year Al
mon E. Roth had resigned his post !
of comptroller, and J. Hugh Jackson I
had taken over the job.
When the graduates were sopho- 1
mores the new building of the Busi
ness School was completed inside
the shell of the historic old Assembly

Hall . . . the Libe stayed open on
Sunday nights for the first time . ..
Stanford Associates was founded.
And then John Bunn was ap
pointed Dean of Men to replace
George B. Culver, and the Laughing
Boys, led by Hank Luisetti, were
the nation's greatest basketball
team.
ROBLE REVOLTS
Roble revolted just before pledg
ing and quieted down again . . . Ev
erett Dean became the new basket
ball coach ... Ex Committee gave
Stanford a new boathouse, and the
Cubberleys gave it a new Educa
tion Building.
The physics department invented
the klystron, Mrs. Louis Stern pre
sented the Medical School with a
new laboratory building in San
Francisco, and the first Boathouse
Day was held.
The question of the next presi
dent of the University was post
poned when Dr. Ray Lyman Wil
bur was asked to remain in office
until 1942.
Dink Templeton resigned as track
coach . . . the first Big Game dance
was held . . . the Stanford Family
Call came into being ... as head
lines screamed and polls were taken,
the B.A.C. named Clark Shaugh
nessy football coach.
Crew returned to Stanford . . .
the first Back to the Farm celebra
tion was a sensational success . . .
"Pitch" Johnson was appointed
track coach . . . Herbert Hoover talk
ed informally to the student body
. . . members of the track team
broke two world's records and tied
one . . . $15 was added to the quar
terly tuition fee.
And to the whispered echo of
marching feet and gunfire across the
Atlantic, Stanford is still eating its
dinners at 6:15.

marching feet and gunfire across the
Atlantic, Stanford is still eating its
dinners at 6:15.
Since the Class of '40 arrived at J
Stanford one warm fall day four j
years ago, the web of world his- |
tory has been spun at so dizzying a
rate that many times events on the !
Kami have been edged into the
shadows.
But still, Stanford has changed in
a good many ways during those J
years, has progressed in some and
regressed in others. Although the
p.ittern is multi-colored and con
fusing, the major trends are unmis- |
takably upward.
Viewed through the spectacles of
local H. G. Wells, the Farm's out
line of history makes this kind of J
picture:

The Class of '40 arrives at Stan
ford to enjoy the advantages of the
first pre-registration period and
spends a wild and woolly first quar
ter—losing the mud fight to the
sophomores, seeing the tradition
abolished forever, staging a riot in
Palo Alto after being refused free
admission to the movie.
A Nitery was built by the A.S.S.U.
ns the great structure of Memorial
Hall rose day by day, and the Frost
Memorial Amphitheater sunk deeper
and deeper behind it.
Stanford was beaten in the first of
four Big Games it was fated to lose
while the Class of '40 was in school
. . . the Division of Speech and
Drama was founded . . . the Con
valescent Home Masque Ball king
queen contest was abolished because
it wasn't democratic.
