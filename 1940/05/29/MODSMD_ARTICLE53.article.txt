# Field Day Ends Spring Football
## 
### 
Coach Clark Shaughnessy will
put his Indian gridders on display
fcr the l-Â»st time this spring Sat
urday in the Stadium when the
squad goes through a glorified
practice session in the first an
nual Football Field Day.
Festivities will start promptly at
2:00 o'clock. Included on the program
will be passing and kicking contests
for distance and accuracy, running
races, and pass catching contests.
The drill will close with a 30-minute
scrimmage. Backfield Coach Marchy
Schwartz has been placed in charge
of the day, which takes the place of
the former spring intrasquad game.
The scrum will give Farm grid
fans a preview of the brand of foot
ball the Big Red Machine will use
next fall, although Coach Shaugh
nessy hasn't had time in the brief
spring practice period allo\ved by
Pacific Coast Conference rules to
really establish his system.
