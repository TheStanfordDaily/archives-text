# 'Thanks'...Bill Ellington

### COACH W. B. ELLINGTON 
The editor of The Daily, in asking me to write a short article for this
column, has given me the opportunity to express my sincere thanks and
appreciation to the members of the track team, the track captain, the
student track manager and his assistants, the assistant track coach and the
official recorder of times and distances, for their wonderful spirit of help
and co-operation that have made this the happiest season of my whole
coaching career.
It has often been claimed that track is a sport for the individualâ€”that
a track athlete's success or failure depends entirely upon himself. I used
to think that there was a lot of truth in this statement, but that was be
fore the Spring of 1940. Today I am firmly convinced hat real success in
track and field is as much dependent on team spirit and co-operations as
it is in football, baseball and other team sports. Many of our average
athletes have accomplished unexpected things just because their team
mates were with them all the way and as happy as they over their suc
cesses. Our "cripples" have been carried through their periods of extreme
disappointment by the good-will and complete understanding of the other
boys. Our veterans have always been willing to share their experience and
knowldge of their events with the beginners (newcomers).
It seems to me that if the spirit of sportsmanship, fair play and co
operation such as I have found in this team could be spread about the
world many of our most vexing national and international problems would
soon be solved.
