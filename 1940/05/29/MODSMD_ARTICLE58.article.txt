This is supposed to be 30 for this |
jollyumnist, and next fall you class j
jf '41ers, '42ers, '43ers, and grads
A'ill look at the adjective slinging
is dished out by my successor, Jerry
Brucker.
1 suppose that since this is 30 I
should shed a. tear cr two as the
coffin of Slants—Volume 97—goes
off to the morgue. But that would
hard'y do.
We could take a look at the 1939-
10 athletic season in retrospect, and
point out statistical championships
and moral victories just for our own
satisfaction. It would help soothe ■
Dur shattered nerves, for this has j
been a bad year for titles.
Perhaps you think there was too j
much track in Slants this spring,
Imt can you point out a single j
man on the campus who didn't
talk ahout Bill Ellington's near
championship track team? Just
about every day saw some phe- |
nomenal performance whether it
was by Clyde Jeffrey, Paul Moore,
or little Bob Kenyon, the pole
vaulter. Maybe there wasn't
enough about spring football in
this column, but it's pretty hard, I
found out. to be sports editor, go
out for track, and find time to
write about spring grid.

THIS VOLUME wasn't so hot as
far at: being able to point to things
that this column has accomplished.
My fault, I guess; I should have left
the hurdling up to Sid Hayes and
Dick Simpson.
We poked around the trophy
. room ever in the gym, found it in-.
adequate, and suggested that the
new Tower of Babylon (Hoover
Libe) house it, if it could he ar
ranged. It's an idea for Jerry to
work on.
We could have harangued the
Board of Athlctic Control for not
putting up some bleachers on Angell
Field, but we'd seen John Shallen
berger, Arch Jenkins, and Jerry
Mayer (in order) get no place fast
on that line. But I think that the
overflowing crowds which showed
up for Angell Field meets sort of
showed the B.A.C. the inadequacy of
their seating facilities.
Maybe, now that they've got
Franklin (Pitch) Johnson as their
new track coach next year, they'll
do a little more to help him out and
make his first year a success than
they did Bill Ellington's first and
only year.
vJerry Mayer can claim credit for
Hank Luisetti's No. 7 being put
away for posterity to look at. Ex
Committee took action the first of
this volume.

SUGGESTIONS ARE now in or
der. Those that I list are the result
of thinking over what Slants could
have talked about some of those
limes when he was lost for want of
column-chatter.
1. This is the case of the alumni
members on the Board of Athletic
Control. As students now i( would
be hard for anything to be accom
plished. but when you do become
ahunni (and should you be strong
in the alumni politics) some sort of

pressure should be put upon the
Alumni Association not to elect
men who never took any interest
in athletics until they were out of
school. ;
The three men now on the Board
never were athletes, nor were they j i
sver interested until they got out I
md. became powers in the associa
tion. It seems that the problem of j
he athlete would be best handled
ind appreciated if they were in the !
hands of former Block S or Circle S j
.nen.
2. The B.A.C. should appro
priate $15,000 or so for those long
looked-for bleachers on Angell
Field, for it looks as though Coach
Shaughnessy will have some large
crowds watching his football team
next year and there'll be more
revenue available than there was
this year.
3. Then we suggest that the
alumni keep their hands out of the
athletic pie, especially football. Let I
the coaches, and especially Coach
Shaughnessy and his assistants, han
dle the games themselves. Alumni
are only valuable in securing new
talent. They never are when at odd?-
with the coach,
4. Now that the B.A.C. has
practically a new corps of coaches
what with Coach Shaughnessy
and Frank Johnson hired to start
duty next fall, we hope that they'll
treat them better than they did
their predecessors.
It's pretty hard to work under the |
conditions Tiny Thornhill and Bill !
Ellington had to work under this
year. Bill, especially, did a splendid
job, which never will be appreciated
It was pretty hard for the powers
to take when Stanford won the Big |
Meet, but they breathed easier when j
we lost to Southern California.

THANKS NOW to all those who've |
helped me turn out the sports news, '
both coaches and writers. My thanks j
especially to Don Liebendorfer. It': j
your turn now, Jerry.
