# Dear Hutch:
## 
### 
SO MIH301)V remarket] to me tiie oilier clay that
Volume 97 of The Daily hadn't pursued a single
devastating campaign. I'his guy was a little per
turbed because every Daily editor for generations
hack had booed or cheered some darned thing. I
guess the only quasi-campaigns we conducted were
the ones for I 1 I the retention of student aid, i2i a
complete sundeck for the Boathousc, Ull a sugges
tion for reorganization of the Convalescent Home
Di i\e and il> incorporation with Back-to-the-l" arm
\\ eek, Ilia constant plea for a hands-off policy in
the current European fiasco. Io I a meager appeal
for an iron rail in the I nion Cellar, and (6l a hint
lo the I uiou Hoard of Directors regarding the \ ita
in i n content of certain of their foodless beverages.
Well, these quasi-campaigns ended in amazing
success. Look at our score on them.
1. Student aid will be retained, partly perhaps
because The Daily tried lo show I hi" wins and
\\ here fores of that fund.
2. The Boathousc roof wasn't built.
Ihe Convalescent Home Drive will not be re
organized according lo I he Daily s suggestion.
I. America is pulling more and more hands
(maybe to be followed by marching feet I into the
European holocaust.
5. There is no iron rail in the I, 1 nion Cellar. Ihe
joint still looks like ihe inside of a calaboose.
0. There are few vitamins in Cellar lomalo juice.
The >lulT is apparently false-front.
So you see, Hutch, the power of the press is a
wonderful thing.
I want you lo have fun and the best of luck lo you.
