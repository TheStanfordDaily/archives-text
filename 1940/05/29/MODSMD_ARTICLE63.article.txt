## WAR MONGERS 
### 
r pIE EDITOR. Sir?:
When very young I entered a restaurant to find
h hitherto unknown item on the menuâ€”"Liberty
Steak. I soon discovered that, it whs hamburger, puri

fied of any taint of un-Americanism by the changing
of its German-sounding name. To my youthful mind
it seemed absurd that sensible men could descend to
such depths in their suspicious passions.
We hear on every hand, "Keep America Out of the
War!" But if men's hearts and mincli are to be poison
ed by the deadly pases of fear and suspicion, the war
has already reached America. Must we give up all
faith, all human decency? Possibly the answer is yes;
but if it is not, the letter of a loyal but carefully
anonymous American was unjustified libel, slander of
the worst sort.
