# RIGHT TO FRIENDSHIP

r JpiIE EDITOR, SIR:
R is inconceivable to me, a freshman, that a
"loyal American" and especially a Stanford student
could take such an attitude as lately expressed in
Campus Opinion (May 27).
It seems necessary to recall to that pri son the motto
of Stanford, "Die Luft dor Freiheit Weht"; or if this
sounds too fifth-columnish to his delicate ears "The
Winds of Freedom Ate Blowing." And to recall that
the German faculty should be permitted the right of
visiting whomever they wish.
