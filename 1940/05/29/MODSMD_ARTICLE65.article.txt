# BULL SESSION
## 
### SHERMAN MELLINKOFF 
TO WHICH I SET MY SIGN AND SEAL
last day of any enterprise—from four years of
school to 60 or 70 years of life—is a field day for
platitudes and bromides. "Well, that's that," people
remark with singular insight. Oh, "I hate to see it all
end," they sigh, with faun-eyes and a grandmother's
catch in the voice. And worst of all is that profound
and eternally correct remark, "Life goes on."
There is no real reason for indulging in the ob
vious when a project is finished. The hyphenated
words "so-long" are quite enough, without resurrect
ing a ghostly horde of post-mortem remarks from the
graves of sophistry. And there is still less reason to
indulge in a touching little drama, starring oneself,
with, "Long, Long Ago" for background music, and
soft blue lights playing about the last part of a man
to leave a room.
At least verbally insulated from the sentiments of
a grammar school valedictorian, then, I feel safe m
stating the plain fact that it is an appreciated privi
lege to be able to send three hundred and fifty words
of one's uncensored opinion to the linotypist five times
a week. It is a privilege (for the writer) because it is
a rarity.
The Bill of Rights notwithstanding, expediency and
materialism often censor one's thoughts. And with a
(challenged) civilization apparently dominated by ma
terialism in the offing, a college columnist, however
small his audience, should feel grateful for an oppor
tunity that may fade quickly—the opportunity for a
freedom more absolute than it will ever be again.

YES, there have been suggested columns that
this year's Bull Session couldn't print. But those
are vivid enough, I trust, in the Stanford mind al
ready. What was printed, however, was an.effort at
honesty. And I need not say, "If there be any I have
offended, let him speak." I need not make that an
nouncement because the offended have already spoken.
One might almost say that my foot has been in a num
ber of hornets' nests. From mercy killings to sorority
initiations, and from Hortensc Figgins (the critic with
crumbs in her cranium) to pacifism and neutrality—l
have run the gamut on multi-stung feet.
But fortunately, martyr-complexes are not made
by hornets, and stung feet toughen, and don't soften,
the sole. Besides, a criticizing hornet's sting is a kiss
to a columnist; it assures him that he is not being com
pletely banal. And so, if I have been too sarcastic
and too bitter, as concerned friends have warned me, it
must be that I am journalistically romantic—fishing
for those stinging kisses.
I trust the Great Editor in Heaven, with his merci
fully slipshod copy-reading, will forgive me if I have
insulted Stanford women and Hortense. Next year's
Bull Sessioner will make amends, I am sure. To him
I will the hornets—and the orivilege.

offended, let him speak." I need not make that an
nouncement because the offended have already spoken.
One might almost say that my foot has been in a num
ber of hornets' nests. From mercy killings to sorority
initiations, and from Hortensc Figgins (the critic with
crumbs in her cranium) to pacifism and neutrality—l
have run the gamut on multi-stung feet.
But fortunately, martyr-complexes are not made
by hornets, and stung feet toughen, and don't soften,
the sole. Besides, a criticizing hornet's sting is a kiss
to a columnist; it assures him that he is not being com
pletely banal. And so, if I have been too sarcastic
and too bitter, as concerned friends have warned me, it
must be that I am journalistically romantic—fishing
for those stinging kisses.
I trust the Great Editor in Heaven, with his merci
fully slipshod copy-reading, will forgive me if I have
insulted Stanford women and Hortense. Next year's
Bull Sessioner will make amends, I am sure. To him
I will the hornets—and the orivilege.
TO WHICH I SET MY SIGN AND SEAL
last day of any enterprise—from four years of
school to 60 or 70 years of life—is a field day for
platitudes and bromides. "Well, that's that," people
remark with singular insight. Oh, "I hate to see it all
end," they sigh, with faun-eyes and a grandmother's
catch in the voice. And worst of all is that profound
and eternally correct remark, "Life goes on."
There is no real reason for indulging in the ob
vious when a project is finished. The hyphenated
words "so-long" are quite enough, without resurrect
ing a ghostly horde of post-mortem remarks from the
graves of sophistry. And there is still less reason to
indulge in a touching little drama, starring oneself,
with, "Long, Long Ago" for background music, and
soft blue lights playing about the last part of a man
to leave a room.
At least verbally insulated from the sentiments of
a grammar school valedictorian, then, I feel safe m
stating the plain fact that it is an appreciated privi
lege to be able to send three hundred and fifty words
of one's uncensored opinion to the linotypist five times
a week. It is a privilege (for the writer) because it is
a rarity.
The Bill of Rights notwithstanding, expediency and
materialism often censor one's thoughts. And with a
(challenged) civilization apparently dominated by ma
terialism in the offing, a college columnist, however
small his audience, should feel grateful for an oppor
tunity that may fade quickly—the opportunity for a
freedom more absolute than it will ever be again.
