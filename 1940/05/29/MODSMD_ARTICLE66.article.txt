## PERSONAL PREPAREDNESS 
### DR. RAY LYMAN WILBUR 
By DR. RAY LYMAN WILBUR

jVEARLY every young person in this country is
wondering at this time just what he or she can
do to be better prepared personally for the emergen
cies that, may arise while the United States is under
going military preparedness. Two things are definite:
first, that no one knows how far the United States will
go down the road toward war; and second, that if it
does again enter into armed conflict it will have to
call upon the pool of students who have been gath
ered together in the colleges and universities scat
tered throughout the nation. Whatever the processes
may be, the results are that a majority of the young
leaders of most of the important interests of the coun
try have been brought into these institutions.
We know from our previous experience that ihose
who are adequately prepared in some particular field
are the ones who arc most desired and most likely to
find a place in emergency or in war. When a mod
ern nation is compelled to fight it requires the efforts
of practically everyone to adequately prepare and to
carry on if war becomes a reality. The important
problem for each person is to prepare as fast as he
can and as completely as he can. If one has entered
a professional field or a field of special training i1 is
important to complete it as rapidly as possible. If I
were a voung man or a young woman seeking an edu
cation I would advantage now of such a summer
quarter as we offer at Stanford or the summer schools
or summer sessions elsewhere in order to be just lhat
much ahead and just that much more capable of fitting
in to the needs of the nation and to be personally
prepared.

r>REPAREDNF.SS means more than simply prepara
tion for some particular function that is to be
carried out. It means a careful analytical study of
what is going on in the world, a willingness to spend
some time on the historical phases of international
relations, and the use of intelligence in giving proper
value to all sorts of propaganda that are inevitable.
A part of preparedness is to make a distinction between
propaganda or claims and the essential facts of any
siven situation. There is no use in worrying or fuss
ing unduly about a world situation that is tragic and
terrible. There is. though, every use in making the
best possible personal preparation to play a helpful
part if our country comes into peril. The poorest pos
sible preparation is to shut both eyes and ears and stop
the brain from working, in the hope that everything
will come out all right and that somebody else will
take all of the responsibilities imf>lved. At the least,
our nation will have to take on problems of relief that
have now become very extensive and that may reach
proportions beyond that even before known in his
tory. This is the day when to have an open mind and
an open heart should bo a distinguishing feature of
intelligent personal preparedness.
