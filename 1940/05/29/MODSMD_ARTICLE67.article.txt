# Russian Play, Light Opera Round Out Theatre Year
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Those lighthcartcd members of
Stanford society who feel that only
tin alarmist spends time at the Libe
this close to finals, need not depend
solely on the cinema for entertain
ment during what's left of the school
year.
First, the Division of Speech and
Drama is winding up the season
with a three-night run of "Che
khov's "Three Sisters," starting to
morrow night.
LIGHT OPERA COMING
And in the light opera line we
have Jarmila Novotna of the Metro
politan Opera Company singing in
"The Merry Widow" and Victor Her
bert's "Red Mill" coming to the Cur
ran Theater in San Francisco next
week and week after next, respec
tively.
Judging from the first dress re
hearsal, "Three Sisters" should fce
an excellent evening's entertain
ment. Late nineteenth century cos
tumes, done in Helen Green's usual
superb style, and colorful .sets, prop
erly Victorian and, I understand,
authentic antiques, do much to set
the quet, tragic mood of the show.
GOOD FAREWELL SCENE
Particularly worthy of mention is
Mitzi Hinds' scene in which she says
goodbye to her lover, Vershinin,
played by Ash Wilson; and Tod Mar
cuse rates tops in the third act. Bob
Coombs gets his iaughs consistently
without losing any of the sympathy
in the character, ancl Milly Green
and Serena Frankel both offer con-

sistcntly good portrayals.
The last act tableau in which Olga,
Irena and Masha watch their youth
ful hopes die is beautifully done and
memorable.
