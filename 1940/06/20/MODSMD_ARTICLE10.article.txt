# Political Satire Is First Play This Summer
## Players to Present 'Mr. Congressman' Week of July 15-20 
### 
Professor Hubert Heffner, execu
tive head of the Division of Speech
arid Drama, announces an active
season of summer productions for
the Stanford Players. Professor
Heffner has emphasized since his
coming to Stanford the desire for
an outstanding "producing" theater
rather than a mere "reproducing"
theater.
Since the Stanford Players wish
to give opportunity to American
playwrights to see their new works
in production, they are opening
their summer season with the pre
miere of Leon Pearson's comic satire
on politics, "Mr. Congressman."
The play will be presented in the
Little Theater of Memorial Hall
July 15-20.
AUTHOR IS JOURNALIST
The author is a Washington news
paper man familiar with the behind
the-scenes life of the national capi
tol. He has taken for his central
character a Congressman from the
South who has been a loyal Demo
crat but not a New Dealer.
His problem is the perennial one
of getting himself re-elected. Be
cause of his antagonism to the New
Deal he finds himself with more
purge than patronage. Mr. Pearson
ihas included a romance with a
Cuban beauty whom the representa
tive met when he was on a Con
gressional junket to Havana.
'SHE STOOPS TO CONQUER'
The second summer production
will be Oliver Goldsmith's brilliant
comedy, "She Stoops to Conquer,"
scheduled for July 29 to August 3
in Memorial Hall Auditorium. Op
portunities for becoming acquainted
with this 18th century masterpiece
outside of a library have been all
too rare.
While these two plays are primar
ily presented by the students of the
drama department, they will also be
open to any students registered in
ihe Summer Quarter. Tryouts for
both plays will be announced in a
few days.
In addition to these two plays, the
Division of Speech atid Drama will
probably produce the prize-winning
play of the Etherege Award in Prose
Comedy, sponsored by the Drama
tists' Alliance of Stanford Univer
sity, provided that comedy, in the
judgment of the Players' staff, mer
its production. This play is sched
uled for August 17 in the Little
Theater.
All of the plays will be under the
direction of F. Cowles Strickland,
with scenery designed by Waldemar
Johansen and costumes designed by
Helen Green.
