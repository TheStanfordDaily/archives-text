# Costumers Have Headaches, Too, Mrs. Green Admits
## 
### 
It is well known that directors of'
amateur theatricals, doubtful about
cei*tain members of the cast, have
the jitters on first night. But the
costume designers also have head
aches.
Mrs. Helen Green, instructor in
costuming, needed plenty of aspirin
on one particular evening, she relat
ed last night to an NBC radio au
dience on the "Stanford University
—On the Air" program. She spoke
on "Costume Designing."
"It was planned by the director to
save expense to draft unsuspecting
local high school boys to play the
parts of the supers," she related.
BUTTONS CUT OFF—ALAS!
"Only one who has been faced
with the problem of dressing an un
seen army of untrained actors can
appreciate my delight on hearing
that chain mail was easy to simulate.
Long, cotton underwear dyed armor
gray and brushel with aluminum
paint would suffice.
"This I did. And to be sure that
they would fit.. I purchased all large
sizes, thus allowing—l thought—for
shrinkage and tall actors. Perhaps
the assembling of costumes for six
plays and two armies caused my be
fuddled state —there must have been
some reason for cutting the buttons
all off. I can't remember now why
I did it, but I did, and packed the
newly created armor securely away
in the bottom of the Richard the 111
trunk.
"I did remember on the night of
the company's premier of that play
that the art director, at the time he
told about the chain mail, had also
mentioned the lack of tabards
(sleeveless heraldic tunics) in the
company wardrobe. But as we had
not had the supers with us for the
dress rehearsal, the armor was never
brought forth and their absence nor
the lack of buttons noticed until the
night of the performance.
TOO BAD—NO TABARDS
"Ten minutes before their scene
the army of high school youths
emerged from the dressing room clad

in silvery, ill-fitting underwear gap
ing open from neck to crotch. Nor
were there any tabards to cover their
immodesty. The art director was
speechless. The youths hilariously
unhelpful. And I glued to the spot
in desperation at what to do. The

! play must go on.
"And it did. Richard's army
fought Richmond's in gray union
suits covered discreetly by red flan
! nel night-gown shaped shirts of
; King Lear!"
