# Wilbur Lauds Summer Quarter
## 
### 
President Ray Lyman Wilbur yes
terday addressed the following greet
ing to new students in summer
quarter:
The most pleasant feature of the
Stanford campus during the sum
mer quarter is that there is plenty
of room. The daylight lasts longer,
and there is an unusually good op
portunity to get acquainted both
with fellow students and with the
faculty. Some of the distractions
associated with the other three
quarters, such as intercollegiate ath
letics, are absent. There is an op
portunity for picnics, excursions,
teas, and various social entertain
ments that give the summer quarter
a distinct quality of its own.
It is always a pleasure to me to
welcome newcomers to the Stanford
campus, whether they be professors
or students. I have confidence that
they will soon find their way around,
that they will enjoy their Stanford
associations and find opportunities
to renew them as often as possible
in the years to come.
This is just a word of welcome to
those who are joining the Stanford
Family for the first time.
