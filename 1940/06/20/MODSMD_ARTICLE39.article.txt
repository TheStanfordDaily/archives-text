# Terman Addresses Scientists On Future of 'Gifted Children'
## 
### 
SEATTLE. June* 18.—A new instalment of one of the most fascinating
serial stories in all of science was read to the American Association for
the Advancement of Science here Tuesday night by Dr. Lewis M. Terman,
Stanford University psychologist who is the fahter of the intelligence test
in America.
Speaking as president of the Pacific Division of the A.A.A.S.. Dr. Ter-

man addressed leading scientists of 4
the nation, meeting at the Univer
sity of Washington, on "Psycholog
ical Approaches to the Biography of
Genius."
Much of his address was given
over to the disclosure of new infor
mation about his famous group of
1,300 "gifted children."
These were exceptionally bright
children singled out by intelligence
tests given in 300 California ele
mentary and secondary schools dur
ing the early 1920'5. Their progress
through school and into careers has
been closely followed by psychol
ogists. They now range in age from ,
22 to 37 years.
BRIGHTEST CHILD
When singled out more than 15 [
years ago, each gifted child was the j
brightest in a group of about 200. j
His intelligence quotient was 140 or ;
better. Today the same individual J
has almost precisely the same I.Q.
that he had then, Dr. Terman has J
found in the course of a two-year I
follow-up investigation of all mem
bers of the group.
It is therefore possible to say, he
declared, that we can identify the
intellectually gifted individual al
most as accurately in the third gi*ade
as at age 30.
The follow-up study has shown
that 90 per cent of the gifted 1.300
individuals entered college, and 93
per cent, of those who entered grad
uated, a high proportion having been
student leaders and having gradu
ated with honors.
GRADUATE WORK
Two-thirds of the men and one
half of the women did graduate
work, and today 50 are holders of
the Ph.D. degree, 50 are doctors of!
medicine, 85 are lawyers, and 35
hold graduate enigneers' or archi
tects' degrees.
The average earned income at 30
years of age is $3,000. A dozen are
earning between $10,000 and $li>.ooo.
Two-thirds are married. The di
vorce, mortality and insanity rates
are below the general rates, while
the suicide rate approaches the gen
eral rate. The incidence of arrest
and imprisonment is extremely low.
The I.Q.'s of the spouses, though
high, are well below those of the
gifted individuals, and the mean I.Q.
of the 300 out of 500 offspring that
have been tested is 127, "which rep
resents," Dr. Terman said, "about
(he expected regresison toward the

mean of the generality."
WIDE SUCCESS
The range of success in the 1,300
group is very wide and at present
extends downward to occupations as
humble as those of policeman, car
penter, gardener, gas station opera
tor, department store floor-walker,
store clerk, house-to-house canvass
er, small rancher, seaman, telephone
operator, typist, and filing clerk.
Sex is a factor which plays a
role apart from intelligence in de
termining achievement, Dr. Terman
said, noting that after school days a
great majority of women cease to
compete with men.
"The exclusive devotion of women
to domestic pursuits," he declared,
"robs the arts and sciences of a
large fraction of the genius that
might otherwise be dedicated to
them."
What will be the future of gifted
individuals?
FUTURE DISCUSSED
"I regard it as unlikely," Dr. Tor
man said, "that more than a few
score oi my 1.300 subjects will attain
to a national reputation or that more
than a dozen or so will become really
eminent. It would be surprising if

even one of them a hundred years
hence should be found among the
thousand most eminent persons of
history.
"In sheer intellectual ability, how
ever, I am sure that my group over
laps Cattell's thousand most eminent
persons in history. Although the
group probably contains no intellect
at all comparable with that of New
ton or Shakespeare, I believe it con
tains many who are intellectual
equals of Washington, the 19th most
eminent on Cattell's list, and some

who are intellectual equals of Na
poleon, the most eminent man in
history.
"I believe that several in my
group are probably as well endowed
with literary gifts as were Longfel
low, Hawthorne, or George Sand."
However genius is defined, it
eventually comes to mean "one who
is endowed with superior intellec
tual ability—ability to acquire and
manipulate concepts, the shorthand
symbols without which abstract
thinking cannot proceed."

uated, a high proportion having been
student leaders and having gradu
ated with honors.
GRADUATE WORK
Two-thirds of the men and one
half of the women did graduate
work, and today 50 are holders of
the Ph.D. degree, 50 are doctors of!
medicine, 85 are lawyers, and 35
hold graduate enigneers' or archi
tects' degrees.
The average earned income at 30
years of age is $3,000. A dozen are
earning between $10,000 and $li>.ooo.
Two-thirds are married. The di
vorce, mortality and insanity rates
are below the general rates, while
the suicide rate approaches the gen
eral rate. The incidence of arrest
and imprisonment is extremely low.
The I.Q.'s of the spouses, though
high, are well below those of the
gifted individuals, and the mean I.Q.
of the 300 out of 500 offspring that
have been tested is 127, "which rep
resents," Dr. Terman said, "about
(he expected regresison toward the

mean of the generality."
WIDE SUCCESS
The range of success in the 1,300
group is very wide and at present
extends downward to occupations as
humble as those of policeman, car
penter, gardener, gas station opera
tor, department store floor-walker,
store clerk, house-to-house canvass
er, small rancher, seaman, telephone
operator, typist, and filing clerk.
Sex is a factor which plays a
role apart from intelligence in de
termining achievement, Dr. Terman
said, noting that after school days a
great majority of women cease to
compete with men.
"The exclusive devotion of women
to domestic pursuits," he declared,
"robs the arts and sciences of a
large fraction of the genius that
might otherwise be dedicated to
them."
What will be the future of gifted
individuals?
FUTURE DISCUSSED
"I regard it as unlikely," Dr. Tor
man said, "that more than a few
score oi my 1.300 subjects will attain
to a national reputation or that more
than a dozen or so will become really
eminent. It would be surprising if

even one of them a hundred years
hence should be found among the
thousand most eminent persons of
history.
"In sheer intellectual ability, how
ever, I am sure that my group over
laps Cattell's thousand most eminent
persons in history. Although the
group probably contains no intellect
at all comparable with that of New
ton or Shakespeare, I believe it con
tains many who are intellectual
equals of Washington, the 19th most
eminent on Cattell's list, and some

who are intellectual equals of Na
poleon, the most eminent man in
history.
"I believe that several in my
group are probably as well endowed
with literary gifts as were Longfel
low, Hawthorne, or George Sand."
However genius is defined, it
eventually comes to mean "one who
is endowed with superior intellec
tual ability—ability to acquire and
manipulate concepts, the shorthand
symbols without which abstract
thinking cannot proceed."


DR. LEWIS M. TERMAN
SEATTLE. June* 18.—A new instalment of one of the most fascinating
serial stories in all of science was read to the American Association for
the Advancement of Science here Tuesday night by Dr. Lewis M. Terman,
Stanford University psychologist who is the fahter of the intelligence test
in America.
Speaking as president of the Pacific Division of the A.A.A.S.. Dr. Ter-

man addressed leading scientists of 4
the nation, meeting at the Univer
sity of Washington, on "Psycholog
ical Approaches to the Biography of
Genius."
Much of his address was given
over to the disclosure of new infor
mation about his famous group of
1,300 "gifted children."
These were exceptionally bright
children singled out by intelligence
tests given in 300 California ele
mentary and secondary schools dur
ing the early 1920'5. Their progress
through school and into careers has
been closely followed by psychol
ogists. They now range in age from ,
22 to 37 years.
BRIGHTEST CHILD
When singled out more than 15 [
years ago, each gifted child was the j
brightest in a group of about 200. j
His intelligence quotient was 140 or ;
better. Today the same individual J
has almost precisely the same I.Q.
that he had then, Dr. Terman has J
found in the course of a two-year I
follow-up investigation of all mem
bers of the group.
It is therefore possible to say, he
declared, that we can identify the
intellectually gifted individual al
most as accurately in the third gi*ade
as at age 30.
The follow-up study has shown
that 90 per cent of the gifted 1.300
individuals entered college, and 93
per cent, of those who entered grad
uated, a high proportion having been
student leaders and having gradu
ated with honors.

"I regard it as unlikely," Dr. Tor
man said, "that more than a few
score oi my 1.300 subjects will attain
to a national reputation or that more
than a dozen or so will become really
eminent. It would be surprising if

even one of them a hundred years
hence should be found among the
thousand most eminent persons of
history.
"In sheer intellectual ability, how
ever, I am sure that my group over
laps Cattell's thousand most eminent
persons in history. Although the
group probably contains no intellect
at all comparable with that of New
ton or Shakespeare, I believe it con
tains many who are intellectual
equals of Washington, the 19th most
eminent on Cattell's list, and some

who are intellectual equals of Na
poleon, the most eminent man in
history.
"I believe that several in my
group are probably as well endowed
with literary gifts as were Longfel
low, Hawthorne, or George Sand."
However genius is defined, it
eventually comes to mean "one who
is endowed with superior intellec

manipulate concepts, the shorthand
symbols without which abstract
thinking cannot proceed."


DR. LEWIS M. TERMAN
SEATTLE. June* 18.—A new instalment of one of the most fascinating
serial stories in all of science was read to the American Association for
the Advancement of Science here Tuesday night by Dr. Lewis M. Terman,
Stanford University psychologist who is the fahter of the intelligence test
in America.
Speaking as president of the Pacific Division of the A.A.A.S.. Dr. Ter-

man addressed leading scientists of 4
the nation, meeting at the Univer
sity of Washington, on "Psycholog
ical Approaches to the Biography of
Genius."
Much of his address was given
over to the disclosure of new infor
mation about his famous group of
1,300 "gifted children."
These were exceptionally bright
children singled out by intelligence
tests given in 300 California ele
mentary and secondary schools dur
ing the early 1920'5. Their progress
through school and into careers has
been closely followed by psychol
ogists. They now range in age from ,
22 to 37 years.
BRIGHTEST CHILD
When singled out more than 15 [
years ago, each gifted child was the j
brightest in a group of about 200. j
His intelligence quotient was 140 or ;
better. Today the same individual J
has almost precisely the same I.Q.
that he had then, Dr. Terman has J
found in the course of a two-year I
follow-up investigation of all mem
bers of the group.
It is therefore possible to say, he
declared, that we can identify the
intellectually gifted individual al
most as accurately in the third gi*ade
as at age 30.
The follow-up study has shown
that 90 per cent of the gifted 1.300
individuals entered college, and 93
per cent, of those who entered grad
uated, a high proportion having been
student leaders and having gradu
ated with honors.
GRADUATE WORK
Two-thirds of the men and one
half of the women did graduate
work, and today 50 are holders of
the Ph.D. degree, 50 are doctors of!
medicine, 85 are lawyers, and 35
hold graduate enigneers' or archi
tects' degrees.
The average earned income at 30
years of age is $3,000. A dozen are
earning between $10,000 and $li>.ooo.
Two-thirds are married. The di
vorce, mortality and insanity rates
are below the general rates, while
the suicide rate approaches the gen
eral rate. The incidence of arrest
and imprisonment is extremely low.
The I.Q.'s of the spouses, though
high, are well below those of the
gifted individuals, and the mean I.Q.
of the 300 out of 500 offspring that
have been tested is 127, "which rep
resents," Dr. Terman said, "about
(he expected regresison toward the

mean of the generality."
WIDE SUCCESS
The range of success in the 1,300
group is very wide and at present
extends downward to occupations as
humble as those of policeman, car
penter, gardener, gas station opera
tor, department store floor-walker,
store clerk, house-to-house canvass
er, small rancher, seaman, telephone
operator, typist, and filing clerk.
Sex is a factor which plays a
role apart from intelligence in de
termining achievement, Dr. Terman
said, noting that after school days a
great majority of women cease to
compete with men.
"The exclusive devotion of women
to domestic pursuits," he declared,
"robs the arts and sciences of a
large fraction of the genius that
might otherwise be dedicated to
them."

individuals?
