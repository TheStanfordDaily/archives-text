# Dramatists Vie For Four Farm Play Awards
## Broadway Actors, Critics to Choose Contest Winners 
### 
Dramatists from 28 states and
three Canadian provinces—169 writ
ers in all —are now in competition
for the four awards for verse plays,
comedies, sketches, and dramatic
criticism offered this summer by
Stanford's Dramatic Alliance.
Prizes for competition which have
drawn entries from all over the
United States are the Maxwell An
derson Award for Verse Drama, the
Etherege Award for Prose Comedy,
winning play to be produced in Me
morial Hall later in the summer, the
Gray Award in Dramatic Criticism,
and the McGaw Award for Dra
matic Sketches.
CALIFORNIA LEADS
California residents lead the list of
entrants with 60, 11 more than from
New York. Ohio ranks a poor third
with 11 entries. Other states are
represented with from eight to one
entry. The location of participants
provides a representation from ev
ery area of the United States, rather
than being concentrated in small
sections of the country as in pre
vious years. This years' total num
ber of entries represents an increase
of 71 over the number received when
the contest program began four
years ago.
The contests for new plays is a
part of the summer's activities ar
ranged by the Dramatists' Alliance
of Stanford University, which this
summer will make the subject of
comedy the theme of its programs.
Lectures, dramatic readings, and
productions will center ai'ound the
theme.
