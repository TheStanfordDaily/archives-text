# Dr. Mears Lists Summer Plans
## 
### DR. ELIOT G. MEARS 
Director of Summer Quarter
Again it is my privilege, on behalf
of the University community, to ex
tend a welcome to the students and
staff of our summer quarter. Our
sincere wish is that you may feel at
home from the time you register
until your course of study is com
pleted.
The Stanford summer quarter of
fers an unusual opportunity for
combined study, recreation, and en
tertainment. The session of nearly
eleven weeks, with a shorter period
available for teachers, provides a
unique chance for students to make
progress and gain time, scholastic
ally, under conditions which offer
superior academic facilities.
Without the distractions of under
graduate organized outside activities,
the summer quarter lists courses in
most fields of knowledge with spe
cial emphasis, moreover, upon ad
vanced instruction.
CLASSES SMALLER
The addition of a large and dis
tinguished staff of visiting profes
sors brings us into contact with men
of different experience, fresh view
points, and .experts in special sub
jects. This distinctive feature of our
summer quarter, which should at
tract students, is not appreciated
adequately by Stanford men and
women registered during the au
tumn, winter, and spring quarters.
Not only is it possible for quali
fied persons to enroll for these
courses, but also smaller classes and
more intimate contact with visiting
and regular faculty personnel are
distinct advantages.
From time to time special lectures
and other university activities will
be announced in both the Univer
sity Calendar and The Stanford
Daily. All too frequently these
summer attractions escape the no
tice of students, as well as the fac
ulty and general public.
TUESDAY SERIES FREE
The Tuesday Evening Series,
which will be continued throughout
the quarter, will be devoted largely
to public lectures, concerts, and mo
tion pictures. Professor Charles E.
Martin, visiting professor of political
science from the University of Wash
ington and a scholar of established
reputation, will open the series on
"une 25, speaking on "America
Faces the World."
These regular entertainments,
•presented during the academic year
sy the Committee on Public Exer
cises. are offered without charge to
'he University community. It should
oe noted that during the summer
quarter these exercises will continue
o be held in Memorial Hall, but the
starting time will be 8 p.m. instead
■if 7:30, as during the other three
quarters.
The Dramatists' Alliance, under
the direction of Dr. Margery Bailey,
has arranged a most attractive pro
cram devoted to comedy. In addi
tion to the Monday evening series
of lectures, there will be two play
readings, two film exhibitions, and a
winning play based upon the quar
ter's activities.
NEW AND OLD PLAYS
Beginning its policy of presenting
new plays even before they are seen
in New York, the Stanford Speech
and Drama Division will present on
July 17-20, "Mr. Congressman," by
Leon Pearson, brother of Drew
Pearson of "Washington Merry-Go-
Round" fame. This play is a comic
&atire on a southern congressman.
On August 1, 2, and 3, the Divi
sion will give Oliver Goldsmith's
"She Stoops to Conquer." Plans are
being made to present the winning
comedy in the Dramatists' Alliance
contest, as well as a studio program
of one-act plays written by the mem
bers of the play-writing class.
A Stanford summer session would
be incomplete without a splendid
series of concerts. This year Mrs.
Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge has
;.gain contributed her patronage
which commenced in the summer
quarter of 1931. With the added
support of the Friends of Music,
four Beethoven trios for piano and
strings will be given by Warwick
2vans, Gunnar Johansen, and Sylvia

Lent on August 6, 9, 13, and 20 in
the Memorial Hall.
At the Memorial Church the Uni
versity chaplain, Dr. D. Elton True
blood, will conduct regular Sunday
morning services. The University
organist, Dr. Warren D. Allen, will
render recitals on Sunday evenings
and Thursday afternoons.
SEVERAL CONFERENCES
Again this year, conferences of im
portant groups provide a striking
feature of our Univeristy program.
During June there will be the Cali
fornia Editors Conference and the
opening of the annual Teachers
Development Workshop which will
be continued until August 2. There
will be three additional summer
seminars in the field of education
known as the Social Education In
vestigation Workshop, the Confer
ence on Teacher Development, and
the Conference on Safety Education.
The noteworthy Business Confer
ence by the Graduate School of Busi
ness, and a significant Conference on
Radio and Education, sponsored
jointly by the Federal Radio Edu
cation Committee and Stanford Uni
versity, will be held during July.

Western hospital administrators
meet on the campus August 11-23.
The Public Relations Institute has
been scheduled for August 12-13,
and the final meeting thus far is the
Organic Chemistry Conference on
August 19-22.
PILOTS' COURSE
Among the notable opportunities
for special instruction this session
may be mentioned the summer pilot
training course sponsored gratis by
the Civil Aeronautics Authority.
Dr. David L. Webster, head of the
physics department, who is in charge
of ground training for the civilian
course, advises that a quota of 40
students will receive flight instruc
tion, without academic credit, at the
Palo Alto Airport.
May we forget, so far as we can,
the terrible tragedies of the present
strife in order that we may enjoy
and profit from the academic calm,
the satisfying environment, and the
personal firendship of a summer on
the Stanford farm.
Traffic violation fines assessed
Stanford students by Men's Council
aggregated $748 in 1938-39.

new plays even before they are seen
in New York, the Stanford Speech
and Drama Division will present on
July 17-20, "Mr. Congressman," by
Leon Pearson, brother of Drew
Pearson of "Washington Merry-Go-
Round" fame. This play is a comic
&atire on a southern congressman.
On August 1, 2, and 3, the Divi
sion will give Oliver Goldsmith's
"She Stoops to Conquer." Plans are
being made to present the winning
comedy in the Dramatists' Alliance
contest, as well as a studio program
of one-act plays written by the mem
bers of the play-writing class.
A Stanford summer session would
be incomplete without a splendid
series of concerts. This year Mrs.
Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge has
;.gain contributed her patronage
which commenced in the summer
quarter of 1931. With the added
support of the Friends of Music,
four Beethoven trios for piano and
strings will be given by Warwick
2vans, Gunnar Johansen, and Sylvia

Lent on August 6, 9, 13, and 20 in
the Memorial Hall.
At the Memorial Church the Uni
versity chaplain, Dr. D. Elton True
blood, will conduct regular Sunday
morning services. The University
organist, Dr. Warren D. Allen, will
render recitals on Sunday evenings
and Thursday afternoons.
SEVERAL CONFERENCES
Again this year, conferences of im
portant groups provide a striking
feature of our Univeristy program.
During June there will be the Cali
fornia Editors Conference and the
opening of the annual Teachers
Development Workshop which will
be continued until August 2. There
will be three additional summer
seminars in the field of education
known as the Social Education In
vestigation Workshop, the Confer
ence on Teacher Development, and
the Conference on Safety Education.
The noteworthy Business Confer
ence by the Graduate School of Busi
ness, and a significant Conference on
Radio and Education, sponsored
jointly by the Federal Radio Edu
cation Committee and Stanford Uni
versity, will be held during July.

Western hospital administrators
meet on the campus August 11-23.
The Public Relations Institute has
been scheduled for August 12-13,
and the final meeting thus far is the
Organic Chemistry Conference on
August 19-22.
PILOTS' COURSE
Among the notable opportunities
for special instruction this session
may be mentioned the summer pilot
training course sponsored gratis by
the Civil Aeronautics Authority.
Dr. David L. Webster, head of the
physics department, who is in charge
of ground training for the civilian
course, advises that a quota of 40
students will receive flight instruc
tion, without academic credit, at the
Palo Alto Airport.
May we forget, so far as we can,
the terrible tragedies of the present
strife in order that we may enjoy
and profit from the academic calm,
the satisfying environment, and the
personal firendship of a summer on
the Stanford farm.
Traffic violation fines assessed
Stanford students by Men's Council
aggregated $748 in 1938-39.
Director of Summer Quarter
Again it is my privilege, on behalf
of the University community, to ex
tend a welcome to the students and
staff of our summer quarter. Our
sincere wish is that you may feel at
home from the time you register
until your course of study is com
pleted.
The Stanford summer quarter of
fers an unusual opportunity for
combined study, recreation, and en
tertainment. The session of nearly
eleven weeks, with a shorter period
available for teachers, provides a
unique chance for students to make
progress and gain time, scholastic
ally, under conditions which offer
superior academic facilities.
Without the distractions of under
graduate organized outside activities,
the summer quarter lists courses in
most fields of knowledge with spe
cial emphasis, moreover, upon ad
vanced instruction.
CLASSES SMALLER
The addition of a large and dis
tinguished staff of visiting profes
sors brings us into contact with men
of different experience, fresh view
points, and .experts in special sub
jects. This distinctive feature of our
summer quarter, which should at
tract students, is not appreciated
adequately by Stanford men and
women registered during the au
tumn, winter, and spring quarters.
Not only is it possible for quali
fied persons to enroll for these
courses, but also smaller classes and
more intimate contact with visiting
and regular faculty personnel are
distinct advantages.
From time to time special lectures
and other university activities will
be announced in both the Univer
sity Calendar and The Stanford
Daily. All too frequently these
summer attractions escape the no
tice of students, as well as the fac
ulty and general public.
TUESDAY SERIES FREE
The Tuesday Evening Series,
which will be continued throughout
the quarter, will be devoted largely
to public lectures, concerts, and mo
tion pictures. Professor Charles E.
Martin, visiting professor of political
science from the University of Wash
ington and a scholar of established
reputation, will open the series on
"une 25, speaking on "America
Faces the World."
These regular entertainments,
•presented during the academic year
sy the Committee on Public Exer
cises. are offered without charge to
'he University community. It should
oe noted that during the summer
quarter these exercises will continue
o be held in Memorial Hall, but the
starting time will be 8 p.m. instead
■if 7:30, as during the other three
quarters.
The Dramatists' Alliance, under
the direction of Dr. Margery Bailey,
has arranged a most attractive pro
cram devoted to comedy. In addi

of lectures, there will be two play
readings, two film exhibitions, and a
winning play based upon the quar
ter's activities.

Director of Summer Quarter
Again it is my privilege, on behalf
of the University community, to ex
tend a welcome to the students and
staff of our summer quarter. Our
sincere wish is that you may feel at
home from the time you register
until your course of study is com
pleted.
The Stanford summer quarter of
fers an unusual opportunity for
combined study, recreation, and en
tertainment. The session of nearly
eleven weeks, with a shorter period
available for teachers, provides a
unique chance for students to make
progress and gain time, scholastic
ally, under conditions which offer
superior academic facilities.
Without the distractions of under
graduate organized outside activities,
the summer quarter lists courses in
most fields of knowledge with spe
cial emphasis, moreover, upon ad
vanced instruction.
CLASSES SMALLER
The addition of a large and dis
tinguished staff of visiting profes
sors brings us into contact with men
of different experience, fresh view
points, and .experts in special sub
jects. This distinctive feature of our
summer quarter, which should at
tract students, is not appreciated
adequately by Stanford men and
women registered during the au
tumn, winter, and spring quarters.
Not only is it possible for quali
fied persons to enroll for these
courses, but also smaller classes and
more intimate contact with visiting
and regular faculty personnel are
distinct advantages.
From time to time special lectures
and other university activities will
be announced in both the Univer
sity Calendar and The Stanford
Daily. All too frequently these
summer attractions escape the no
tice of students, as well as the fac
ulty and general public.
TUESDAY SERIES FREE
The Tuesday Evening Series,
which will be continued throughout
the quarter, will be devoted largely
to public lectures, concerts, and mo
tion pictures. Professor Charles E.
Martin, visiting professor of political
science from the University of Wash
ington and a scholar of established
reputation, will open the series on
"une 25, speaking on "America
Faces the World."
These regular entertainments,
•presented during the academic year
sy the Committee on Public Exer
cises. are offered without charge to
'he University community. It should
oe noted that during the summer
quarter these exercises will continue
o be held in Memorial Hall, but the
starting time will be 8 p.m. instead
■if 7:30, as during the other three
quarters.
The Dramatists' Alliance, under
the direction of Dr. Margery Bailey,
has arranged a most attractive pro
cram devoted to comedy. In addi
tion to the Monday evening series
of lectures, there will be two play
readings, two film exhibitions, and a
winning play based upon the quar
ter's activities.
NEW AND OLD PLAYS
Beginning its policy of presenting
new plays even before they are seen
in New York, the Stanford Speech
and Drama Division will present on
July 17-20, "Mr. Congressman," by
Leon Pearson, brother of Drew
Pearson of "Washington Merry-Go-
Round" fame. This play is a comic
&atire on a southern congressman.
On August 1, 2, and 3, the Divi
sion will give Oliver Goldsmith's
"She Stoops to Conquer." Plans are
being made to present the winning
comedy in the Dramatists' Alliance
contest, as well as a studio program
of one-act plays written by the mem
bers of the play-writing class.
A Stanford summer session would
be incomplete without a splendid
series of concerts. This year Mrs.
Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge has
;.gain contributed her patronage
which commenced in the summer
quarter of 1931. With the added
support of the Friends of Music,
four Beethoven trios for piano and
strings will be given by Warwick
2vans, Gunnar Johansen, and Sylvia

Lent on August 6, 9, 13, and 20 in
the Memorial Hall.
At the Memorial Church the Uni
versity chaplain, Dr. D. Elton True
blood, will conduct regular Sunday
morning services. The University
organist, Dr. Warren D. Allen, will
render recitals on Sunday evenings
and Thursday afternoons.
SEVERAL CONFERENCES
Again this year, conferences of im
portant groups provide a striking
feature of our Univeristy program.
During June there will be the Cali
fornia Editors Conference and the
opening of the annual Teachers
Development Workshop which will
be continued until August 2. There
will be three additional summer
seminars in the field of education
known as the Social Education In
vestigation Workshop, the Confer
ence on Teacher Development, and
the Conference on Safety Education.
The noteworthy Business Confer
ence by the Graduate School of Busi
ness, and a significant Conference on
Radio and Education, sponsored
jointly by the Federal Radio Edu

Western hospital administrators
meet on the campus August 11-23.
The Public Relations Institute has
been scheduled for August 12-13,
and the final meeting thus far is the
Organic Chemistry Conference on
August 19-22.
PILOTS' COURSE
Among the notable opportunities
for special instruction this session
may be mentioned the summer pilot
training course sponsored gratis by
the Civil Aeronautics Authority.
Dr. David L. Webster, head of the
physics department, who is in charge
of ground training for the civilian
course, advises that a quota of 40
students will receive flight instruc
tion, without academic credit, at the
Palo Alto Airport.

cram devoted to comedy. In addi
tion to the Monday evening series
of lectures, there will be two play
readings, two film exhibitions, and a
winning play based upon the quar
ter's activities.
NEW AND OLD PLAYS
Beginning its policy of presenting
new plays even before they are seen
in New York, the Stanford Speech
and Drama Division will present on
July 17-20, "Mr. Congressman," by
Leon Pearson, brother of Drew
Pearson of "Washington Merry-Go-
Round" fame. This play is a comic
&atire on a southern congressman.
On August 1, 2, and 3, the Divi
sion will give Oliver Goldsmith's
"She Stoops to Conquer." Plans are
being made to present the winning
comedy in the Dramatists' Alliance
contest, as well as a studio program
of one-act plays written by the mem
bers of the play-writing class.
A Stanford summer session would
be incomplete without a splendid
series of concerts. This year Mrs.
Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge has
;.gain contributed her patronage
which commenced in the summer
quarter of 1931. With the added
support of the Friends of Music,
four Beethoven trios for piano and
strings will be given by Warwick
2vans, Gunnar Johansen, and Sylvia

Lent on August 6, 9, 13, and 20 in
the Memorial Hall.
At the Memorial Church the Uni
versity chaplain, Dr. D. Elton True
blood, will conduct regular Sunday
morning services. The University
organist, Dr. Warren D. Allen, will
render recitals on Sunday evenings
and Thursday afternoons.
SEVERAL CONFERENCES
Again this year, conferences of im
portant groups provide a striking
feature of our Univeristy program.
During June there will be the Cali
fornia Editors Conference and the
opening of the annual Teachers
Development Workshop which will
be continued until August 2. There
will be three additional summer
seminars in the field of education
known as the Social Education In
vestigation Workshop, the Confer
ence on Teacher Development, and
the Conference on Safety Education.
The noteworthy Business Confer
ence by the Graduate School of Busi
ness, and a significant Conference on
Radio and Education, sponsored
jointly by the Federal Radio Edu
cation Committee and Stanford Uni
versity, will be held during July.

Western hospital administrators
meet on the campus August 11-23.
The Public Relations Institute has
been scheduled for August 12-13,
and the final meeting thus far is the
Organic Chemistry Conference on
August 19-22.
PILOTS' COURSE
Among the notable opportunities
for special instruction this session
may be mentioned the summer pilot
training course sponsored gratis by
the Civil Aeronautics Authority.
Dr. David L. Webster, head of the
physics department, who is in charge
of ground training for the civilian
course, advises that a quota of 40
students will receive flight instruc
tion, without academic credit, at the
Palo Alto Airport.
May we forget, so far as we can,
the terrible tragedies of the present
strife in order that we may enjoy
and profit from the academic calm,
the satisfying environment, and the
personal firendship of a summer on
the Stanford farm.
Traffic violation fines assessed
Stanford students by Men's Council
aggregated $748 in 1938-39.
