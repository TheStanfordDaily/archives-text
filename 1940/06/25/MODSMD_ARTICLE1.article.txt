# Classics Prof Dabbles With Numismatics
## Visiting Yale Teacher Collects Assyrian, Greek, Roman Coins 
### 
Numismatist, numismatician, or
numismatologist — any one of these
names will fit Professor Alfred El
linger, Lampson professor of Latin
at Yale University and visiting
member of the classics department
at Stanford.
What this array of titles boils down
to is that Professor Ellinger is a
fancier and authority on coins.
As a fellow at the American school
at Athens in 1925-26, Professor El
linger became interested in numis
matics while working at the excava
tions in Corinth.
After returning to Yale, he under
took to organize and prepare for
publication the large collection of
coins of the Yale Museum. Since
that time, he has conducted several
courses in numismatics and done
additional excavating in Greek and
Syrian ruins, "although I'm not an
archaeologist," he stated.
"Coins are primarily useful in de
termining the age of a ruin and the
amount of commerce and exchange
of its period," he pointed out.
This statement of the man-of-let
ters' non-commercial interest in
coins shamed our previous attempts
to locate valuable 1913 Liberty nick
els, and made Indian-head-penny
saving seem piratical.
"Classification of old coins is a
difficult job," he said. "Roman coins
have an inscription and the em
peror's head on them, but as to
Greek coins, you just have to know
the types. There is a great deal of
literature in the British Museum, if
you don't recognize the coin by
then."
Professor Ellinger has not had
time to get around to see the numis
matic collection in the Leland Stan
ford Junior Museum. The Frances
Agnes Bowman Collection there is
a small but excellent collection of
Egyptian, Persian, Greek, and Roman
coins. The chief item of interest in
the collection is a small, gold Per
sian coin dated as being issued in the
time of Darius I, about 520 B.C. On
display in the same room is a larger
group of Catholic papal coins, and
in the oriental exhibit may be found
a fine collection of Chinese coins.

to is that Professor Ellinger is a
fancier and authority on coins.
As a fellow at the American school
at Athens in 1925-26, Professor El
linger became interested in numis
matics while working at the excava
tions in Corinth.
After returning to Yale, he under
took to organize and prepare for
publication the large collection of
coins of the Yale Museum. Since
that time, he has conducted several
courses in numismatics and done
additional excavating in Greek and
Syrian ruins, "although I'm not an
archaeologist," he stated.
"Coins are primarily useful in de
termining the age of a ruin and the
amount of commerce and exchange
of its period," he pointed out.
This statement of the man-of-let
ters' non-commercial interest in
coins shamed our previous attempts
to locate valuable 1913 Liberty nick
els, and made Indian-head-penny
saving seem piratical.
"Classification of old coins is a
difficult job," he said. "Roman coins
have an inscription and the em
peror's head on them, but as to
Greek coins, you just have to know
the types. There is a great deal of
literature in the British Museum, if
you don't recognize the coin by
then."
Professor Ellinger has not had
time to get around to see the numis
matic collection in the Leland Stan
ford Junior Museum. The Frances
Agnes Bowman Collection there is
a small but excellent collection of
Egyptian, Persian, Greek, and Roman
coins. The chief item of interest in
the collection is a small, gold Per
sian coin dated as being issued in the
time of Darius I, about 520 B.C. On
display in the same room is a larger
group of Catholic papal coins, and
in the oriental exhibit may be found
a fine collection of Chinese coins.
Numismatist, numismatician, or
numismatologist — any one of these
names will fit Professor Alfred El
linger, Lampson professor of Latin
at Yale University and visiting
member of the classics department
at Stanford.
What this array of titles boils down
to is that Professor Ellinger is a
fancier and authority on coins.
