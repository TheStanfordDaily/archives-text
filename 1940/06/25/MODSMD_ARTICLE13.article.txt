Few people pass up a juicy stake.
Yet, Mrs. Orrin L. Elliott did when
Dr. Elliott waved a telegram, an
nouncing his appointment as the first
registrar of Stanford University in
1891.
Speaking before the Stanford Fac
ulty Women's Club yesterday after
noon, Mrs. Elliott reviewed her soon
to-be-published book, "It Happened
This Way."
The book will be issued next year
as Stanford celebrates its 50th anni
versary. It tells of the Elliotts' and
Dr. David Starr Jordan's arrival at
Stanford, three months before the
University's opening on October 1.
When the two families arrived

they expected to find a beautiful
campus. Instead, there were few
buildings—only the inner quadrangle
and Encina Hall. The ten faculty
houses were yet to be built on a
row which Dr. Jordan named Al
varado.
Mrs. Elliott read passages here and
there from her book, which gave an
nccoitnt of the earlier times at the
University. The early faculty mem
bers, she said, could not find board
ing houses at Menlo Park. Menlo
Park boasted in those days 14 sa
loons but no rooming houses. She
said professors often ate lunches on
the lawns and shared the same
desks.
