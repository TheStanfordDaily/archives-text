# U. S. Mentality Lags, Wilbur Tells Editors
## Three Instructors Address Publishers, Editors' Convention 
### 
America's mental progress has not
kept up with that of science, Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur told a con
ference of 100 California editors
here Saturday night.
"The mental side of the modern
American is full of blind spots and
dishwater," he said.
Dr. Wilbur was one of four mem
bers of the Stanford faculty who
gave major addresses before the
Midyear Editorial Conference, held
here Saturday and Sunday under
the joint sponsorship of the Division
of Journalism and the California
Newspaper Publishers' Association.
Dr. Charles E. Martin, acting pro
fessor of political science, discussing
America's future foreign policy, ad
vocated our taking over French and
Netherlands colonies in America,
and contended "we ought to ride the
fifth column out of the country on
a rail."
OPINION SURVEY PLAN
Dr. Norman C. Meier, associate
professor of psychology, University
of lowa, presented a plan for sur
veying "expert opinion" in the
country to obtain valid answers to
questions requiring factual knowl
edge of economics, history, psychol
ogy, or sociology.
Clifford F. Weigle, assistant pro
fessor of journalism, discussed "1940
Newspaper Trends."
Dr. Wilbur told the newspaper
men the chief cause of mental de
cadence in this country was the
American people's reluctance to face
disagreeable facts.
"We do more for cattle than we
do for children nowadays," he as
serted.
Americans have lost the willing
ness to accept responsibility for their
own actions and the actions of those
around them, the President said. He
added there is too much of the at
titude that "I don't have to take out
insurance—the government will take
care of me."
AMERICANS LED BY NOSE
Characterizing American culture
as a "soft, crusty civilization," Dr.
Wilbur asserted Americans are too
much inclined to be led around by
the nose.
Besides facing the facts, we must
learn to correct our mental misap
prehensions and keep leadership in
the hands of the experts, he told
the group.
