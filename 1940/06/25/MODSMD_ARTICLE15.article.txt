# 80 Students Enroll in Two Air Courses
## 20 Students Prefer Plane that Requires No Ground Schooling

Stanford students are now being
taught the elements of flying the
unorthodox Stearman - Hammond
airplane as part of a research pro
gram being given in conjunction with
the regular pilot training program.
Twenty students are signed up for
instruction in this course, while 60
students have enrolled in the regu
lar flight instruction course.
The ground-training school is
given at Stanford and the flight in
struction at Palo Alto airport. In
order to aid the safety of the stu
dents the flight instructors are pres
ent at the ground school, while those
on the ground school staff are given
a portion of the flight training.
"The objective of this course is to
train the men to fly safely and keep
them safe during the training,"
stated Professor D. L. Webster,
ground school instructor, while
speaking to the American Associa
tion of Physics Teachers at Seattle
on June 18.
"We can afford plenty of hours in
the classroom to save hazardous
hours in the air, between the first
solo flight and the safety old-timers
have now," Professor Webster as
serted.
The students being instructed in
the Stearman-Hammond type of
plane are not required to take any
ground work, but all of the regular
students in the C.A.A. course are
required to attend eight hours of
ground school a week.
The 20 students enrolled in the
Stearman-Hammond course will,
after 15 hours' instruction, be trans
ferred to the course of training in
the Cub.
