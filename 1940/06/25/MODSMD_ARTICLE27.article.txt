# Library Exhibit Shows Variety
## 
### 
With subject matter ranging from
the manufacture of mattresses to the
works of contemporary artists, Stan
ford students and the general public
have at their disposal at the Univer
sity a number of exhibits which
cover a wide field of information.
Detailed maps of the Maginot and
Siegfried lines area and the approxi
mate extent of their fortifications
are being exhibited by the Hoover
Library, as well as individual maps
of France, Belgium, Luxemburg, and
the Netherlands. Belgium is dis
played in a sectionalized map which
brings out specific areas in greater
detail.
WALT WHITMAN BOOKS
Supplemented by critical and bio
graphical studies, the works of Walt
Whitman, one of America's foremost
poets, are on exhibit in the Stanford
University Library. First editions of
Whitman's works, foreign language
editions, and studies of the author in
French and German are also in
cluded in the collection, which was
only recently acquired by Stanford
and is being exhibited here for the
first time.
Will S. Monroe, one of the first
students to graduate from Stanford
and later a prominent educator,
willed the Whitman collection to
Stanford University upon his death
on his Vermont farm in 1938. Addi
tional material relating to Whitman
is displayed in the Felton Memorial
Library.
INDUSTRIAL WORKS
Industrial exhibits which include
processes involved in the manufac
ture of tile, oil, steel, paper, and
other articles as well as models of
several of the industrial plants may
be seen in the Graduate School of
Business Library. Of particular in
terest is the Wells Fargo Bank Ex
hibit which displays documents of
the gold rush days as well as other
material relating to that period.
Paintings of Will Foster and Nell
Walker Warner are exhibited in the
Thomas Welton Stanford Art Gal
lery. Will Foster's works, which
consist primarily of figures, will be
on display until June 26, while those
of Nell Walker Warner, whose
works are predominantly studies of
still life, will be available until
June 30. Will Foster is well known
as a prominent eastern illustrator.
Early methods of locomotion are
illustrated in the Hopkins Trans
portation Library, and the Hopkins
Memorial Library consists of a re
production of the Hopkins library at
Menlo Park, complete to engraved
silver hinges on the walnut door.
None of the books in the latter
library were issued at a date later
than 1880.
Three additional collections are
available in the Alfred M. Bender
room, formerly the rare book room.
The typographical collection is a
group of more than 100 items repre
senting private presses and limited
editions.
