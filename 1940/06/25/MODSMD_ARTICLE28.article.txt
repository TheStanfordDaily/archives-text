# Bailey Opposes Tardy U.S. Intervention in War Conflict
## 
### 
The United States must take over<
all vital colonial possessions of de
feated European countries, declared
Stanford's Professor Thomas A.
Bailey in his speech last Friday at
the Commonwealth Club in San
Francisco.
Basing his talk on America's posi
tion in the present crisis, Professor

Bailey pointed out the danger of
(Herman air bases near our vital in
terests, including our islands in the
East.
Professor Bailey opposes a tardy
American intervention in the Eu

â–ºropean conflict. Our job is to pre
serve democracy in our own coun
try, he emphasized. The Stanford
history professor has been in Wash
ington the past six months doing re
search on governmental affairs, and
returned only last week.
France's position is hopeless, ac
cording to Bailey, as a French navy
under British control would only re
sult in sterner peace terms from Ger
many. However, his warning to
Americans is to beware of belated
attempts to save democracy and
freedom in Europe at the expense
01 safe and sound conditions at
home.
