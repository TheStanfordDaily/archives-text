### 
Five Stanford engineers are par
ticipating in sessions of the Institute
of the Aeronautical Sciences, meet
ing this week at the California In
stitute of Technology, Pasadena.
Alfred S. Niles, professor of aero
nautic engineering, led a symposium
on "Stability of Aircraft Structures"
Monday afternoon. N. J. Hoff, re
search assistant in the Stanford Vi
bration Laboratory, and John C.
Silliman, '35, of the Pacific Railway
Equipment Company, took part in it.
Russell G. Robinson, '28, of the
National Advisory Committee for
Aeronautics, will show a motion pic
ture film on "Slow Motion Study of
Normal Combustion, Preignition and
Knock in a Spark Ignition Engine."
