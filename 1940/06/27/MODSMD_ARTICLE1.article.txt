# Need for Political Adjustment Stressed in Martin Lecture
## Strong South American Support Advocated in Tuesday Evening Talk 
### 
Professor Charles E. Martin in his lecture on "America Faces the
World" last night in the Memorial Auditorium, stressed the fact that we
are facing a changing world.
We must adjust the democratic way of life to a world in which in
ternational law and pacts of peace have been thrown aside and most

of the European democracies de-<
stroyed, he said.
Historically, there have been
three American foreign policies in
facing Europe, the Americas, and
the Far East, declared Professor
Martin. Toward Europe, he said, our
foreign policy has been one of non
intervention in political affairs, a
policy of neutrality and of peace.
OUTLINES POLICIES
"Future policies as regard Europe
must include defense forces adequate
to protect this country — a foreign
policy in keeping with the conti
nental autarchic regimes," the Wash
ington professor asserted. "There
must be a support of democracy and
international law by all legitimate
means short of war.
"The states of the Americas must
act, on a regional basis, to preserve
their neutrality in the case of wars
between European states. They must
also act together to prevent the in
troduction of the power politics or
the power economies of the totali
tarian states into this region of the
world."
PACIFIC INTERESTS
In so far as our own rights and
interests in the Pacific area are con
cerned, we must determine what
they are, and which ones we are
ready to fight for, he said.
"The failure of the democracies to
champion their principles in Europe
has led to what exists today," he
added.
"In Europe, we must abstain from
her political involvements, encour
age peace and democracy, and be
prepared to resist power politics
and economies.
URGES PREPAREDNESS
"In the Americas, we must be pre
pared to defend the entire hemi
sphere, from the Arctic to Little
America, from invasion from foreign
systems of government, and from po
litical intervention.
"We have come of age in a ter
rible period of the world. Our basic
philosophy and way of life must re
main. But the methods will have to
be in keeping with the forces we
are compelled to resist."
About two-thirds of Stanford's
entering freshmen remain four
years and are graduated.

three American foreign policies in
facing Europe, the Americas, and
the Far East, declared Professor
Martin. Toward Europe, he said, our
foreign policy has been one of non
intervention in political affairs, a
policy of neutrality and of peace.
OUTLINES POLICIES
"Future policies as regard Europe
must include defense forces adequate
to protect this country — a foreign
policy in keeping with the conti
nental autarchic regimes," the Wash
ington professor asserted. "There
must be a support of democracy and
international law by all legitimate
means short of war.
"The states of the Americas must
act, on a regional basis, to preserve
their neutrality in the case of wars
between European states. They must
also act together to prevent the in
troduction of the power politics or
the power economies of the totali
tarian states into this region of the
world."
PACIFIC INTERESTS
In so far as our own rights and
interests in the Pacific area are con
cerned, we must determine what
they are, and which ones we are
ready to fight for, he said.
"The failure of the democracies to
champion their principles in Europe
has led to what exists today," he
added.
"In Europe, we must abstain from
her political involvements, encour
age peace and democracy, and be
prepared to resist power politics
and economies.
URGES PREPAREDNESS
"In the Americas, we must be pre
pared to defend the entire hemi
sphere, from the Arctic to Little
America, from invasion from foreign
systems of government, and from po
litical intervention.
"We have come of age in a ter
rible period of the world. Our basic
philosophy and way of life must re
main. But the methods will have to
be in keeping with the forces we
are compelled to resist."
About two-thirds of Stanford's
entering freshmen remain four
years and are graduated.
Professor Charles E. Martin in his lecture on "America Faces the
World" last night in the Memorial Auditorium, stressed the fact that we
are facing a changing world.
We must adjust the democratic way of life to a world in which in
ternational law and pacts of peace have been thrown aside and most

of the European democracies de-<
stroyed, he said.
Historically, there have been
three American foreign policies in
facing Europe, the Americas, and
the Far East, declared Professor
