# Ross Discusses 'Unconscious Motivations'
## Stanford Psychologist Explains Behavior In Radio Address 
### 
The subtle yet irresistible effect of
unconscious motives on human be
havior was explained by Dr. Rob
ert T. Ross, acting assistant professor
of psychology at Stanford, in a radio
address over Station KPO in the
Stanford University —On the Air
program.
Citing examples from experiments
with hypnotic suggestion as well as
the many forms of natural uncon
scious human motives, Dr. Ross em
phasized the frequency with which
these phenomena affect our every
day actions. He explained pictures
recently published in "Life" showing
students acting abnormally while
under the influence of a hypnotic
"spell," as a quite usual reaction
which has been known for cen
turies.
"Not all of our attitudes, fears, and
reactions are unconsciously moti
vated," said Dr. Ross. "But we do
know that when faced with the ap
parently inexplicable in psycholog
ical experience such as in intuition
and fortune-telling, or rationaliza
tions and excuses —we may well sus
pect the operation of forces in our
own psychological make-up which
remain unknown, unsuspected, un
conscious motives."
