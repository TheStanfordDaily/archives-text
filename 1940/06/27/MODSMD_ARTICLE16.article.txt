### 
Stanford will be well
in the "American Olympics of
1940" when 16 Cardinal track and
field stars engage in the A.A.U. meet
at Fresno Saturday night.
Competing under the colors of the
Olympic Club, Stanford tracksters
will be entered in 13 of the events
against outstanding athletes from all
over the country, who are all out
for honors which might have been
theirs had they been able to partici
pate in the ill-fated twelfth Olympiad
to have been held this summer in
Finland.
D. J. Ferris of New York, secre
tary-treasurer of the A.A.U. meet,
arrived Tuesday with other ranking
officials and declared:
"America has a world of cham
pions this year who planned to com
pete in the Olympic Games. Prac
tically all of them will be in Fresno
for the A.A.U'. carnival, which is in
fact the American Olympics of
1940."
A new scoring system will be used
this year, working on a six-place,
10-8-6-4-2-1 basis for the first time
in 52 years. This replaces the usual
5-3-2-1 plan that has been used for
a number of years.
Stanford tracksters will be very
much in evidence in 13 of the events.
Co-Captain Clyde Jeffrey will not
enter due to a leg injury incurred
at the N.C.2-A. meet last Saturday.
In his place Battaglia will carry the
Olympic Club colors in the 100 and
200-meter dashes.
In the four-man 400-meter relay,
Davis of the Olympic Club is replac
ing Jeffrey. The fourth man is
Browning of Visalia Jaysee, also
under the Olympic Club colors.
