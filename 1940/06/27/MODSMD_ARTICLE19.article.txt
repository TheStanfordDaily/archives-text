# Dr. Bellinger Will Discuss Satire Monday
## Second Lecture In Series Deals With Aristophanes' Works 
### 
Dr. Alfred R. Bellinger of Yale
University, acting professor of
classics, will present a discussion of
the comedies of Aristophanes, Mon
day evening at 8 o'clock in the
lounge of the Women's Clubhouse.
Dr. Bellinger will elaborate on the
fact that the satire of Aristophanes
was largely directed at the conduct
of wars in his time.
This will be the second of the
series of lectures on comedy to be
presented by the Dramatists' Alli
ance every Monday evening
throughout most of the quarter.
Last Monday James Wood of San
Jose State College spoke on "Con
jectures on Comedy."
Dr. Bellinger will speak again on
Monday, July 8, when he will deal
with the comedies of the later
classic writers.
(Editor's Note: The Daily, in the
last issue, quite inexcusably mis
spelled the name of Dr. Bellinger,
for which it now apologizes.)
