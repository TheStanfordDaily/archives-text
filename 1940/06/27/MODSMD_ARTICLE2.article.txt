## McMasters Tells Of Last Days in Paris 
### 
Harry McMasters, '33, correspond
ent in Paris for the New York Her
ald-Tribune, returned last week on
the Washington from the war dev
astated areas of World War 11.
In recounting his experiences
while leaving Paris, Mr. McMasters
said he found autobuses parked
sidewise across the Champs Elysees
every 50 yards to prevent German
planes from landing on the broad
avenue.
Paris had already been bombed,
and his decision was made final when
Daladier and his cabinet were
kicked out and Reynaud was made
Premier.
Policemen with only a few cart
ridges for their pistols and rifles of
the single-firing 1870 models were
left to guard the city.
The train from Paris to the coast
was held up for two hours at Or
leans during a bombing attack. The
tracks had been hit somewhere up
ahead.
The machine guns and anti-air
craft guns were firing all about in
the railroad yards, and their flashes
and the tracer bullets and very light
lit the sky, he said.
On the Washington the threat of
submarine attack was always pres
ent, and the trip itself took two
weeks. The drowning of the third
class purser at Galway was the
only real catastrophe, however.
