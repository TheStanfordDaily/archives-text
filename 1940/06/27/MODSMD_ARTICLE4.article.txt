# Wing-flutter Idea Disproved At Stanford
## Experiments Will Be Continued Here By Walter Vincenti, '40

PASADENA, June 26.â€”For ev
ery airplane there is a critical speed
at which its wings will start to flap
or flutter like a bird's. Up to now,
aeronautical engineers have built
airplanes in the belief that they
could accurately predict by mathe
matics the speed at which wings of
a given pattern will flutter. So long
as the plane lacked power to fly at
that theoretical speed, engineering
sciences rested on the assumption
that the mathematical theory pro
vided a margin of safety.
Today, at the closing session of
the Institute of the Aeronautical
Sciences, a young Stanford engineer
reported on laboratory tests which
have shown the wing-flutter theory
is out of kilter with experimental
results. He is Walter Vincenti, of
Pasadena, a 1940 graduate engineer
from the Guggenheim Aeronautics
Laboratory at Stanford and now a
junior engineer on the staff of the
National Advisory Committee for
Aeronautics at Moffett Field.

Reading a paper jointly written
by him and Professor Elliott G. Reid
of Stanford, Vincenti said actual
wind tunnel tests of a wing model
revealed that its flutter character
istics differ from the theoretical ex
pectation.
"This is a matter of importance,"
he said, "because the mathematical
theory has been steadfastly applied
in designing airplanes.
Vincenti said the work probably
wo aid be continued next year at
Stanford in order to settle the ques
tion whether the theory of wing
flutter is correct or not.
