## 
### 
When the curtain rolls up on "Mr.
Congressman," Leon Pearson's sa
tiric comedy of Washington politics,
the Stanford Division of Speech and
Drama will launch its effort to be
come a "producing" instead of a
"reproducing" theater.
"We want to produce good plays,
new American plays about Ameri
can situations, just as Leon Pear
son's satire is," Professor Hubert
Heffner, head of the Division of
Speech and Drama, said yesterday.
"Stanford is obligated to give play
wrights a chance to see their works
produced if the legitimate theater
is to succeed. Since 1927, the de
cline in the number of plays pro
duced on Broadway has been con
tinuous. The young playwright has
no chance to see his work produced
except in the college and community
theaters."
"Mr. Congressman" will be pro
duced in the Little Theater July 15-
20, under the direction of F. Cowles
Strickland.
