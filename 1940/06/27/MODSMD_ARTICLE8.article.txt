# Scopes and Non-Sequences – by Dwight Mitchell

Just so you will know:
♦ * *
This colm (column) will try to
highlight news of the School of Edu
cation, as it did last year; can't get
all the little newses, there are too
many of them. If you have news,
give it to us —we'll be prowling
around quite a bit. Or leave it with
Miss Irene Craig, Education secre
tary. If you want to get rid of the
column, just see that we get that
Ph.D. and we'll depart. But not
much prospect of that very soon,
worse luck.

Wheel Chair Softball league hits
first round of games today. Ten
teams, maybe more. Soft muscles
groaned and joints creaked at prac
tice games Tuesday. There's been a
revolution, in which Czar Harry
Shipkey replaces Czar Harold C.
Hand; and wheel chair athletes are
out for the biggest season yet. Games
Tuesdays and Thursdays. Inciden
tally, women athletes are breaking
into the line-ups, too. Fine thing.

Education students, if you want to
take a degree from Stanford, you
must take the aptitude test Satur
day at 9 a.m., History Building,
Room 214. If you haven't yet got
accustomed to the Farm's vast spac
es, that's at the corner of the Quad
to the left of the Registrar's office,
where you shelled out that $100 tui
tion money—remember? Of course
you do. Procedure: get bill from
Miss Irene Craig, Education secre
tary; pay cashier; take the nice little
test. That's all there is to it.

Exodus to Los Altos country club
Friday evening—reception for whole
School of Education, all 500 of them
(guess figure) by Dean and Mrs.
Grayson N. Kefauver. Today's very
best advice: be there.

This week's most characteristic re
mark: "Seems quiet around here
this summer." A bit odd—enroll
ment is about same as last summer;
everything going full steam ahead—
School of Education hitting on all 12.

Blame it on the war. Besides, next
week's most characteristic remark
may be something different. Wait
and see.

Education conference, always a big
item in Stanford's summer program,
will be July 11-14. Theme: Teacher
Development. Nationally prominent
educators will appear — besides
Stanford faculty members there will
be Dr. W. Earl Armstrong of the
Commission on Teacher Education,
Dr. Paul B. Sears of Oberlin College
and Dr. John A. Mackey, president
of the Princeton Theological Semi
nary. Who may attend: educational
workers and friends of education.
That includes a lot of folks and many
of them will attend.
To improve your teaching, ob
serve teaching by experts. Demon
stration school started last summer
as another major facility offered by
Stanford. Registration Friday. Miss
Lelia Ann Taggert again in charge.
Another reason why Stanford is the
place to come for more training.
