# Meier Demands Mobilization Of American Brains, Talent
## Professor Asks Social Scientists To Ascertain War Aims

The best brains and talents in America must be mobilized and swung
into action, if the country is to solve its internal and external problems,
said Dr. Norman C. Meier, associate professor of psychology at the Uni
versity of lowa, in a talk to Stanford students Tuesday.
Speaking on "The Measurement of Public Opinion," Dr. Meier told the

►group that the nation must call in
all social scientists to ascertain Hit
ler's motives directly, and then
formulate a definite policy in line
with future contingencies.
Characterizing the government's
policy as "drifting," Dr. Meier urged
the adoption of a "thinking ahead"
policy. This would be achieved, he
suggested, by passing the mass opin
ion over to the experts, who would
return it with recommendations; by
a process of repeated passing back
and forth a degree of unanimity
would be attained.
WITH GALLUP GROUP
Dr. Meier, who has been connected
with the Gallup poll organization
since its inception, said: "Public
opinion polls can yield only dim in
formation on congressional repre
sentation, but they are positive on
foreign affairs. Thus, they are of
great use to cabinet officials. The
general public can indicate the gen
eral trend, and the experts can work
it out."
The lowa psychologist, foreseeing
an unbalanced, angry, prejudiced re
action in this country toward Eu
ropean events, indicated that the
phenomenon was due to use of
propaganda to promulgate various
national viewpoints.
DISCUSSES DIGEST POLL
"I don't believe that Hitler is either
a devil or a fool," said Dr. Meier,
"and I consider the Germans a hard
working and very efficient people."
The early growth of the sampling
of public opinion was high-lighted
by the collapse of the 1936 Literary
Digest poll. The cause of this col
lapse, he asserted, was because of
an unrepresentative sampling via the
telephone book. The use of this
sampling method gave only those
economically able to afford a phone.
OMITTED RELIEFERS
It omitted reliefers, the youngest
crop of voters, and gave women vot
ers only a 10 per cent representa
tion; further, the Democrats were
the "in" party at the time and with
held their Digest ballots; the Repub
licans, in a burst of wishful thinking,
sent theirs in.
"And Time Magazine finished off
the job," Dr. Meier smiled.
