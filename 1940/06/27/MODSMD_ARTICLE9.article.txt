# Meier Demands Mobilization Of American Brains, Talent
## Professor Asks Social Scientists To Ascertain War Aims 
### 
The best brains and talents in America must be mobilized and swung
into action, if the country is to solve its internal and external problems,
said Dr. Norman C. Meier, associate professor of psychology at the Uni
versity of lowa, in a talk to Stanford students Tuesday.
Speaking on "The Measurement of Public Opinion," Dr. Meier told the

â–ºgroup that the nation must call in
all social scientists to ascertain Hit
ler's motives directly, and then
formulate a definite policy in line
with future contingencies.
Characterizing the government's
policy as "drifting," Dr. Meier urged
the adoption of a "thinking ahead"
policy. This would be achieved, he
suggested, by passing the mass opin
ion over to the experts, who would
return it with recommendations; by
a process of repeated passing back
and forth a degree of unanimity
would be attained.
WITH GALLUP GROUP
Dr. Meier, who has been connected
with the Gallup poll organization
since its inception, said: "Public
opinion polls can yield only dim in
formation on congressional repre
sentation, but they are positive on
foreign affairs. Thus, they are of
great use to cabinet officials. The
general public can indicate the gen
eral trend, and the experts can work
it out."
The lowa psychologist, foreseeing
an unbalanced, angry, prejudiced re
action in this country toward Eu
ropean events, indicated that the
phenomenon was due to use of
propaganda to promulgate various
national viewpoints.
DISCUSSES DIGEST POLL
"I don't believe that Hitler is either
a devil or a fool," said Dr. Meier,
"and I consider the Germans a hard
working and very efficient people."
The early growth of the sampling
of public opinion was high-lighted
by the collapse of the 1936 Literary
Digest poll. The cause of this col
lapse, he asserted, was because of
an unrepresentative sampling via the
telephone book. The use of this
sampling method gave only those
economically able to afford a phone.
OMITTED RELIEFERS
It omitted reliefers, the youngest
crop of voters, and gave women vot
ers only a 10 per cent representa
tion; further, the Democrats were
the "in" party at the time and with
held their Digest ballots; the Repub
licans, in a burst of wishful thinking,
sent theirs in.
"And Time Magazine finished off
the job," Dr. Meier smiled.
In discussing the Gallup poll it
self, Dr. Meier said that the mathe
matical theory of probability was
the basis of the sampling procedure.
A cross-section of the U.S. popula
tion is accurately chained, and
samples are taken from representa
tive areas.
POLL EXPLAINED
Then, after sampling, the poll is
broken down into six divisions:
party cleavage, age groups, economic
groups, urban-rural groups, race
groups, and finally religious groups.
The Gallup organization, which has
set a 3 per cent margin for error as
its goal in ascertaining public opin
ion, achieves that goal by quizzing
only 2500 people. Half of these are
men, the other women. To bring the
error margin down to 1 per cent on
the same 50-50 basis, 22,500 people
are interrogated.
The only things that can upset the
accuracy of a poll, Dr. Meier said,
are last-minute shifts in public
opinion or corruption at the ballot
box. A possible objection to using
the results of polls is that it tends
to promote the "bandwagon influ
ence"; that is, causing people to vote
the way they think everyone else is
going to, thus making their vote
count.
Dr. Gallup doubts even this objec

tion, the lowa psychologist said, be
cause of the Roosevelt landslide of
1936 in the face of the Literary Di
gest's predicted Landon victory.
Dr. Meier indicated that America
might help itself out of its prob
lems by establishing what he termed
a "directory of competents," a panel

of experts in every possible field,
who might be polled on questions
pertinent to each's field of endeavor.
Church preferences of Stanford
students last year were led by Epis
copalians. Next were Presbyterians.
Next Catholics.
