Life insurance policies are no<
good if the holder is killed by hos
tile Indians. A copy of such a policy !
dated 1867 may be found along with
other documents of the West dis
played this week in the Graduate
Business Library.
Interesting because of the signa
ture of President U. S. Grant is a
document which attempted to clear
a land title in San Francisco. This
land is traced from a Mexican grant
in 1844. The browned corners of
the paper showed the great age of
the document.
On a lower shelf of the glassed
display case, one comes across a
bill for the sale of 350 gallons of
water for $263. With water costing
about $1.32 a gallon, it is little won
der that the chant of the Gay Nine
ties was: "Wine. Woman and Song!"

' One boldly written document tells
of the mortgage of D. C. Fargo and
his wife to Thomas J. Isbell. D. C.
Fargo was the Fargo of Wells-Fargo
Express, although at this time he
was no longer connected with that
concern.
Included in the collection was an
account of troubles with the Indians
in Nevada. Several years after the
dispute the chief of this band,
Winnemuca, offered to come in and
surrender. Mrs. Ormsby, widow of
Major Ormsby who was killed in
the battle, threatened to shoot Win
nemuca if he set foot in Carson City.
E. T. Coman, Jr., librarian of the
School of Business, left Stanford
some days ago to continue his search
for interesting material on early
California business. His Comstock
display constitutes the first of a series
of similar collections.
