# Stanford Physicist Develops New Ultra-Violet Ray Lamp
## Bol's 'Small as a Match Mercury Light Is 25 Times More Powerful

Development of a convenier
ultra-violet ray lamp 25 times i
powerful as any now in medical u.--
has been achieved by Comelis B,
research associate of the Stanfoi
physics department.
Usefulness of the potent ultr:
violet rays from Mr. Bol's lamp
sterilizing wounds or infections,
treating skin diseases, etc., remai
to be studied by medical men, sir.

Source of the germ-killing ar.
sun-tanning rays is a 1,000-wa
water-cooled mercury vapor lam
already available in a different fori
which has been mounted in a flex
ible mounting for convenient hand
ling by the physician.
SMALL AS A MATCH
The water-cooled mercury lam
was invented several years ago b\
Mr. 801, and is not much bigge
than a kitchen match; and yet it L
by far the most brilliant source o
light in the world when run at ex
treme pressures.
The ultra-violet ray lamp ar
rangement worked out by Mr. Bo!
consists of a brass jacket shaped
something like a stirrup. Mounted
within the jacket is the tiny lamp.
A quartz window allows the passage
of very short ultra-violet rays pro
duced when the mercury in the
lamp is excited by electricity.
EASILY MOVABLE
The movable wire which deliven
the current to the lamp and the
rubber tubing which conducts the
cool water are protected by a flex
ible metallic hose. The lamp can bi
moved freely for use in any kind o
job. The cool water may be sup
plied from the regular house fauo
or from a small circulating outfi
Some physicians have already foun
this light source to be very effectiv
for some skin diseases. The fori
now given to the lamp holder wi
undoubtedly increase the use of th
new light source also for photc
graphic purposes.
