# In-service Teacher Training Is New Stanford Project

"Pack up your troubles in your old kit hag"—especially if that which
gives you disturbance or afflicts your pence of mind happens to concern
school or classroom problems.
What does this all mean? Well, not so long ago. 1936 to be exact. ?. six
weeks seminar was held at Ohio State University wherein teachers in

science and mathematics gathered to<
study the problem of curriculum
and evaluation.
This direct access to research find
ings and consultation with special
ists proved so helpful that it was
decided to expand the idea the fol
lowing summer, and in 1937 a
"workshop" was held at Sarah
Lawrence College, Bronxville, New
York. The leadership was furnished
by three commissions of the Pro
gressive Education Association —the
Commission on the Relation of
School and College, the Commission
on the Secondary School Curricu
lum, and the Commission on Human
Relations —with the assistance also
from the Commission of Intercul
tural Education.
LEARNING IN HUDDLE
One hundred and twenty-six
teachers and other school workers
from educational institutions all
over the United States were in at
tendance. A requirement for ad
mission was that the individual have
some definite problem on which he
was working by himself or as
member of a school group, and the
method used was that of consulta
tion, conference, and small group
discussion,
So pronounced was the success of
the Sarah Lawrence Workshop of
1937, and so likely did it seem that
a new way had been indicated for
in-service education of teachers,
that resources were sought and ob
tained for a more ambitious pro
gram in 1938.
This has rapidly increased because
rightly handled, the production of
material, with the understanding that
it must be reasonably good, affords
an educational incentive to quality,
and in the workshops quality is of
the essence,
This is the same progressive pur
pose employed by the Stanford
Teacher Development Workshop.
It gives capable students freedom
to explore and study intensively
those lines of interest that will
contribute most to their develop
ment.
FIKST YEAR AT STANFORD
Through the workshop, the Uni
versity's resources are made avail
able to teachers and administrators
for use in connection with work on
their own individual and profes
sional problems.
During this past year Stanford
University was invited by the Com
mission on Teacher Education of the
American Council on Education to
co-operate in the development of
improved programs for the educa
tion of teachers.
The University administration and
faculty regard this problem of major
importance.
CO-OPERATIVE METHOD
Frequently formal classes do not
contribute directly to the individual
teacher's needs or his plans for fur
ther professional development. Per
plexing problems may have arisen
during the year.
Caught in the pressure of the daily
routine activities of operating a
classroom or a school, he has not
found it possible to work on these
problems intensively enough to
tolve them. Furthermore, the re
sources on which he might draw
may have been limited.
Workshop procedures are based
on the general philosophy that
teachers and administrators, like
their pupils, develop most when
they are working in a stimulating
situation on the professional prob
lems they regard ns pressing and
important. Thus the program of
Stanford's newly organized work
shop has been planned co-opera
tively by students and staff.
BRING NEW PROBLEMS
For such an early date on such an
important development, the trouble
some problems brought to the work
shop have been many, varied, and

from distant parts of the United j
States.
Educators and administrators from '
Virginia, South Dakota, Wisconsin, |
and Louisiana have "packed their
bags" and stepped right up to pres- !
ent new ideas, new problems, and
to discover new philosophies on ;
progressive democratic education.
In checking a summary of the
problems presented for individual
development, one would imagine that
progressive education would prove
miracles if every "kit bag" could be
opened, solved, and returned for
active duty.
Problems in the fields of subject I
matter—elementary and secondary,
skills in capacity and development
in various fields, curriculum revision I
in schools and colleges, rural school
units, records—including cumulative j
records cards, report cards, record j
cards, and other achievement level j
records and reports; vocational edu- j
cation, physical plant — including I
building construction and junior col
lege building program; curirculum
and other important physical educa
tion problems, and last, but by no J
means least, the teaching profession \
which includes improvements in '
professional service.
MR. WILLETT TESTIFIES
The activities of every participant
have been directed by the demands
of his own problems. Those who
have similar interests have joined j
together and are actively, but some- j
what informally, a-la Stanford, j
working out their problems with the j
help of staff members who are best
equipped to serve them.
To quote the words of Mr. H. I. '
Willett, director of instruction in the
Agusta county public schrtols in i
Staunton, Virginia, who, incidental- :
ly, is a veteran of several eastern
workshops and at present is enrolled j
in the Stanford "shop":
"The main advantage of a work- j
shop is that it frees the individual :
from certain institutional require
ments that may or may not meet
his needs, and makes it possible for ]
him to work on his own problems j
under the guidance of a capable staff
of instructors."
Asked why he had come across ;
the country to attend Stanford's
Teacher Development Workshop, Mr.
Willett replied: "After reading Dr.
Cubberley's book, 'The Principal and ;
His School,' I just had to come to
Stanford."
He also brought along with him
one or two problems he would like
to have solved.
In the firr.t place, he is carefully
studying and evaluating the philoso
phy and practice of curriculum re
vision in California; and, secondly,
he is studying the evaluation tech
niques to be applied in the Virginia
program.
After several similar interviews
with the same cheerful, informal, yet
determined desire to develop, the
summing up came to this general an
swer —"Summer school for credit,
workshop for inspiration."
It would be easy to speak of the
social life at the workshops as some
thing superficial and limited. Ac- j
tually it seems to be something much I
deeper. One member described it as |

"the experience of entering into a
rhythm of thinking, feeling, playing
with a group of adults; the freedom
of Ihe individual in participation in
groups as well as in the planning of
his program; the emphasis which
has been put upon the development
of the whole child."
And she asserts that what affected
her most seriously in the workshop
was "the realization of the meaning
and practice of a democratic form
of living."

gives you disturbance or afflicts your pence of mind happens to concern

MR. WILLETT TESTIFIES
The activities of every participant
have been directed by the demands
of his own problems. Those who
have similar interests have joined j
together and are actively, but some- j
what informally, a-la Stanford, j
working out their problems with the j
help of staff members who are best
equipped to serve them.
To quote the words of Mr. H. I. '
Willett, director of instruction in the
Agusta county public schrtols in i
Staunton, Virginia, who, incidental- :
ly, is a veteran of several eastern
workshops and at present is enrolled j
in the Stanford "shop":
"The main advantage of a work- j
shop is that it frees the individual :
from certain institutional require
ments that may or may not meet
his needs, and makes it possible for ]
him to work on his own problems j
under the guidance of a capable staff
of instructors."
Asked why he had come across ;
the country to attend Stanford's
Teacher Development Workshop, Mr.
Willett replied: "After reading Dr.
Cubberley's book, 'The Principal and ;
His School,' I just had to come to
Stanford."
He also brought along with him
one or two problems he would like
to have solved.
In the firr.t place, he is carefully
studying and evaluating the philoso
phy and practice of curriculum re
vision in California; and, secondly,
he is studying the evaluation tech
niques to be applied in the Virginia
program.
After several similar interviews
with the same cheerful, informal, yet
determined desire to develop, the
summing up came to this general an
swer —"Summer school for credit,
workshop for inspiration."
It would be easy to speak of the
social life at the workshops as some
thing superficial and limited. Ac- j
tually it seems to be something much I
deeper. One member described it as |

"the experience of entering into a
rhythm of thinking, feeling, playing
with a group of adults; the freedom
of Ihe individual in participation in
groups as well as in the planning of
his program; the emphasis which
has been put upon the development
of the whole child."
And she asserts that what affected
her most seriously in the workshop
was "the realization of the meaning
and practice of a democratic form
of living."
"Pack up your troubles in your old kit hag"—especially if that which
gives you disturbance or afflicts your pence of mind happens to concern
school or classroom problems.
What does this all mean? Well, not so long ago. 1936 to be exact. ?. six
weeks seminar was held at Ohio State University wherein teachers in

science and mathematics gathered to<
study the problem of curriculum
and evaluation.
This direct access to research find
ings and consultation with special
ists proved so helpful that it was
decided to expand the idea the fol
lowing summer, and in 1937 a
"workshop" was held at Sarah
Lawrence College, Bronxville, New
York. The leadership was furnished
by three commissions of the Pro
gressive Education Association —the
Commission on the Relation of
School and College, the Commission
on the Secondary School Curricu
lum, and the Commission on Human
Relations —with the assistance also
from the Commission of Intercul
tural Education.
LEARNING IN HUDDLE
One hundred and twenty-six
teachers and other school workers
from educational institutions all
over the United States were in at
tendance. A requirement for ad
mission was that the individual have
some definite problem on which he
was working by himself or as
member of a school group, and the
method used was that of consulta
tion, conference, and small group
discussion,
So pronounced was the success of
the Sarah Lawrence Workshop of
1937, and so likely did it seem that
a new way had been indicated for
in-service education of teachers,
that resources were sought and ob
tained for a more ambitious pro
gram in 1938.
This has rapidly increased because
rightly handled, the production of
material, with the understanding that
it must be reasonably good, affords
an educational incentive to quality,
and in the workshops quality is of
the essence,
This is the same progressive pur
pose employed by the Stanford
Teacher Development Workshop.
It gives capable students freedom
to explore and study intensively
those lines of interest that will
contribute most to their develop
ment.
FIKST YEAR AT STANFORD
Through the workshop, the Uni
versity's resources are made avail
able to teachers and administrators
for use in connection with work on
their own individual and profes
sional problems.
During this past year Stanford
University was invited by the Com
mission on Teacher Education of the
American Council on Education to
co-operate in the development of
improved programs for the educa
tion of teachers.
The University administration and
faculty regard this problem of major
importance.
CO-OPERATIVE METHOD
Frequently formal classes do not
contribute directly to the individual
teacher's needs or his plans for fur
ther professional development. Per
plexing problems may have arisen
during the year.
Caught in the pressure of the daily
routine activities of operating a
classroom or a school, he has not
found it possible to work on these
problems intensively enough to
tolve them. Furthermore, the re
sources on which he might draw
may have been limited.
Workshop procedures are based
on the general philosophy that
teachers and administrators, like
their pupils, develop most when
they are working in a stimulating
situation on the professional prob
lems they regard ns pressing and
important. Thus the program of
Stanford's newly organized work
shop has been planned co-opera
tively by students and staff.
BRING NEW PROBLEMS
For such an early date on such an
important development, the trouble
some problems brought to the work
shop have been many, varied, and

from distant parts of the United j
States.
Educators and administrators from '
Virginia, South Dakota, Wisconsin, |
and Louisiana have "packed their
bags" and stepped right up to pres- !
ent new ideas, new problems, and
to discover new philosophies on ;
progressive democratic education.
In checking a summary of the
problems presented for individual
development, one would imagine that
progressive education would prove
miracles if every "kit bag" could be
opened, solved, and returned for
active duty.
Problems in the fields of subject I
matter—elementary and secondary,
skills in capacity and development
in various fields, curriculum revision I
in schools and colleges, rural school
units, records—including cumulative j
records cards, report cards, record j
cards, and other achievement level j
records and reports; vocational edu- j
cation, physical plant — including I
building construction and junior col
lege building program; curirculum

contribute most to their develop
ment.
FIKST YEAR AT STANFORD
Through the workshop, the Uni
versity's resources are made avail
able to teachers and administrators
for use in connection with work on
their own individual and profes
sional problems.
During this past year Stanford
University was invited by the Com
mission on Teacher Education of the
American Council on Education to
co-operate in the development of
improved programs for the educa
tion of teachers.
The University administration and
faculty regard this problem of major
importance.
CO-OPERATIVE METHOD
Frequently formal classes do not
contribute directly to the individual
teacher's needs or his plans for fur
ther professional development. Per
plexing problems may have arisen
during the year.
Caught in the pressure of the daily
routine activities of operating a
classroom or a school, he has not
found it possible to work on these
problems intensively enough to
tolve them. Furthermore, the re
sources on which he might draw
may have been limited.
Workshop procedures are based
on the general philosophy that
teachers and administrators, like
their pupils, develop most when
they are working in a stimulating
situation on the professional prob
lems they regard ns pressing and
important. Thus the program of
Stanford's newly organized work
shop has been planned co-opera
tively by students and staff.
BRING NEW PROBLEMS
For such an early date on such an
important development, the trouble
some problems brought to the work
shop have been many, varied, and

from distant parts of the United j
States.
Educators and administrators from '
Virginia, South Dakota, Wisconsin, |
and Louisiana have "packed their
bags" and stepped right up to pres- !
ent new ideas, new problems, and
to discover new philosophies on ;
progressive democratic education.
In checking a summary of the
problems presented for individual
development, one would imagine that
progressive education would prove
miracles if every "kit bag" could be
opened, solved, and returned for
active duty.
Problems in the fields of subject I
matter—elementary and secondary,
skills in capacity and development
in various fields, curriculum revision I
in schools and colleges, rural school
units, records—including cumulative j
records cards, report cards, record j
cards, and other achievement level j
records and reports; vocational edu- j
cation, physical plant — including I
building construction and junior col
lege building program; curirculum
and other important physical educa
tion problems, and last, but by no J
means least, the teaching profession \
which includes improvements in '
professional service.
MR. WILLETT TESTIFIES
The activities of every participant
have been directed by the demands
of his own problems. Those who
have similar interests have joined j
together and are actively, but some- j
what informally, a-la Stanford, j
working out their problems with the j
help of staff members who are best
equipped to serve them.
To quote the words of Mr. H. I. '
Willett, director of instruction in the
Agusta county public schrtols in i
Staunton, Virginia, who, incidental- :
ly, is a veteran of several eastern
workshops and at present is enrolled j
in the Stanford "shop":
"The main advantage of a work- j
shop is that it frees the individual :
from certain institutional require
ments that may or may not meet
his needs, and makes it possible for ]
him to work on his own problems j
under the guidance of a capable staff
of instructors."
Asked why he had come across ;
the country to attend Stanford's
Teacher Development Workshop, Mr.
Willett replied: "After reading Dr.
Cubberley's book, 'The Principal and ;
His School,' I just had to come to
Stanford."
He also brought along with him
one or two problems he would like
to have solved.
In the firr.t place, he is carefully
studying and evaluating the philoso
phy and practice of curriculum re
vision in California; and, secondly,
he is studying the evaluation tech
niques to be applied in the Virginia
program.
After several similar interviews
with the same cheerful, informal, yet
determined desire to develop, the
summing up came to this general an
swer —"Summer school for credit,
workshop for inspiration."
It would be easy to speak of the
social life at the workshops as some
thing superficial and limited. Ac- j
tually it seems to be something much I
deeper. One member described it as |

"the experience of entering into a
rhythm of thinking, feeling, playing
with a group of adults; the freedom
of Ihe individual in participation in
groups as well as in the planning of
his program; the emphasis which
has been put upon the development
of the whole child."
And she asserts that what affected
her most seriously in the workshop
was "the realization of the meaning
and practice of a democratic form
of living."
"Pack up your troubles in your old kit hag"—especially if that which
gives you disturbance or afflicts your pence of mind happens to concern
school or classroom problems.
What does this all mean? Well, not so long ago. 1936 to be exact. ?. six
weeks seminar was held at Ohio State University wherein teachers in

science and mathematics gathered to<
study the problem of curriculum
and evaluation.
This direct access to research find
ings and consultation with special
ists proved so helpful that it was
decided to expand the idea the fol
lowing summer, and in 1937 a
"workshop" was held at Sarah
Lawrence College, Bronxville, New
York. The leadership was furnished
by three commissions of the Pro
gressive Education Association —the
Commission on the Relation of
School and College, the Commission
on the Secondary School Curricu
lum, and the Commission on Human
Relations —with the assistance also
from the Commission of Intercul
tural Education.
LEARNING IN HUDDLE
One hundred and twenty-six
teachers and other school workers
from educational institutions all
over the United States were in at
tendance. A requirement for ad
mission was that the individual have
some definite problem on which he
was working by himself or as
member of a school group, and the
method used was that of consulta
tion, conference, and small group
discussion,
So pronounced was the success of
the Sarah Lawrence Workshop of
1937, and so likely did it seem that
a new way had been indicated for
in-service education of teachers,
that resources were sought and ob
tained for a more ambitious pro
gram in 1938.
This has rapidly increased because
rightly handled, the production of
material, with the understanding that
it must be reasonably good, affords
an educational incentive to quality,
and in the workshops quality is of
the essence,
This is the same progressive pur
pose employed by the Stanford

"the experience of entering into a

And she asserts that what affected

"Pack up your troubles in your old kit hag"—especially if that which

What does this all mean? Well, not so long ago. 1936 to be exact. ?. six
weeks seminar was held at Ohio State University wherein teachers in

science and mathematics gathered to<
study the problem of curriculum
and evaluation.
This direct access to research find
ings and consultation with special
ists proved so helpful that it was
decided to expand the idea the fol
lowing summer, and in 1937 a
"workshop" was held at Sarah
Lawrence College, Bronxville, New
York. The leadership was furnished
by three commissions of the Pro
gressive Education Association —the
Commission on the Relation of
School and College, the Commission
on the Secondary School Curricu
lum, and the Commission on Human
Relations —with the assistance also
from the Commission of Intercul
tural Education.
LEARNING IN HUDDLE
One hundred and twenty-six
teachers and other school workers
from educational institutions all
over the United States were in at
tendance. A requirement for ad
mission was that the individual have
some definite problem on which he
was working by himself or as
member of a school group, and the
method used was that of consulta
tion, conference, and small group
discussion,
So pronounced was the success of
the Sarah Lawrence Workshop of
1937, and so likely did it seem that
a new way had been indicated for
in-service education of teachers,
that resources were sought and ob
tained for a more ambitious pro
gram in 1938.
This has rapidly increased because
rightly handled, the production of
material, with the understanding that
it must be reasonably good, affords
an educational incentive to quality,
and in the workshops quality is of
the essence,
This is the same progressive pur
pose employed by the Stanford
Teacher Development Workshop.
It gives capable students freedom
to explore and study intensively
those lines of interest that will
contribute most to their develop
ment.
FIKST YEAR AT STANFORD
Through the workshop, the Uni
versity's resources are made avail
able to teachers and administrators
for use in connection with work on
their own individual and profes
sional problems.
During this past year Stanford
University was invited by the Com
mission on Teacher Education of the
American Council on Education to
co-operate in the development of
improved programs for the educa
tion of teachers.
The University administration and
faculty regard this problem of major
importance.
CO-OPERATIVE METHOD
Frequently formal classes do not
contribute directly to the individual
teacher's needs or his plans for fur
ther professional development. Per
plexing problems may have arisen
during the year.
Caught in the pressure of the daily
routine activities of operating a
classroom or a school, he has not
found it possible to work on these
problems intensively enough to
tolve them. Furthermore, the re
sources on which he might draw
may have been limited.
Workshop procedures are based
on the general philosophy that
teachers and administrators, like
their pupils, develop most when
they are working in a stimulating
situation on the professional prob
lems they regard ns pressing and
important. Thus the program of
Stanford's newly organized work
shop has been planned co-opera
tively by students and staff.
BRING NEW PROBLEMS
For such an early date on such an
important development, the trouble
some problems brought to the work
shop have been many, varied, and

from distant parts of the United j
States.
Educators and administrators from '
Virginia, South Dakota, Wisconsin, |
and Louisiana have "packed their
bags" and stepped right up to pres- !
ent new ideas, new problems, and
to discover new philosophies on ;
progressive democratic education.
In checking a summary of the
problems presented for individual
development, one would imagine that
progressive education would prove
miracles if every "kit bag" could be
opened, solved, and returned for
active duty.
Problems in the fields of subject I
matter—elementary and secondary,
skills in capacity and development
in various fields, curriculum revision I
in schools and colleges, rural school
units, records—including cumulative j
records cards, report cards, record j
cards, and other achievement level j
records and reports; vocational edu- j
cation, physical plant — including I
building construction and junior col
lege building program; curirculum
and other important physical educa
tion problems, and last, but by no J
means least, the teaching profession \
which includes improvements in '
professional service.
MR. WILLETT TESTIFIES
The activities of every participant
have been directed by the demands
of his own problems. Those who
have similar interests have joined j
together and are actively, but some- j
what informally, a-la Stanford, j
working out their problems with the j
help of staff members who are best
equipped to serve them.
To quote the words of Mr. H. I. '
Willett, director of instruction in the
Agusta county public schrtols in i
Staunton, Virginia, who, incidental- :
ly, is a veteran of several eastern
workshops and at present is enrolled j
in the Stanford "shop":
"The main advantage of a work- j
shop is that it frees the individual :
from certain institutional require
ments that may or may not meet
his needs, and makes it possible for ]
him to work on his own problems j
under the guidance of a capable staff
of instructors."
Asked why he had come across ;
the country to attend Stanford's
Teacher Development Workshop, Mr.
Willett replied: "After reading Dr.
Cubberley's book, 'The Principal and ;
His School,' I just had to come to
Stanford."
He also brought along with him
one or two problems he would like
to have solved.
In the firr.t place, he is carefully
studying and evaluating the philoso
phy and practice of curriculum re
vision in California; and, secondly,
he is studying the evaluation tech
niques to be applied in the Virginia
program.
After several similar interviews
with the same cheerful, informal, yet
determined desire to develop, the
summing up came to this general an
swer —"Summer school for credit,
workshop for inspiration."
It would be easy to speak of the
social life at the workshops as some
thing superficial and limited. Ac- j
tually it seems to be something much I
deeper. One member described it as |

"the experience of entering into a
rhythm of thinking, feeling, playing
