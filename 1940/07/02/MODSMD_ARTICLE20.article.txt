# Building Boom Hits Campus This Summer
## Underpass, Libe, Faculty Homes Rise; Fraternity Rebuilds 
### 
Construction running into many
thousands of dollars is in progress
on the University this summer. Pro
fessors are building new houses, fra
ternity is remodeling its old house,
and an over pass is being built at
the entrance to Palm Drive.
Three homes are being built by
members of the faculty. Professor
Edward Shaw is building a new
home on Los Arboles. Next to him
but facing Searsville Road, Mrs. Ev
elyn Stone, retiring house mother of
the Gamma Phi Beta sorority, is
building a home.
Professor Fred C. Hanker, who is
beginning his first year on the Stan
ford faculty next fall, is building a
campus home on the corner of Sal
vatierra and Coronado.
Stanford can forget looking for
ward to any grading of campus roads
as a lack of funds prevents anything
being done on them this summer.
Within the next week construction
of the overpass at Palm Drive will
be started. This will be the only time
that this street will be closed to
traffic. It will be reopened about
the first week in August. The by
ways leading to it from El Camino
Real will be constructed during this
time.
Following its reopening, these by
ways will be used as a detour for
the traffic on El Camino.
Remodeling their house gives the
Kappa Alpha fraternity the distinc
tion of being the only group on the
campus with a major piece of con
struction under way. Since it is re
quired by the University that all
fraternity houses be rebuilt on the
s&rrte foundations on which they
were originally built, this piece of
construction is termed "major re
modeling."
All construction, including the
Hoover Library, will be finished by
the first of next year. This includes
the underpass under the railroad
tracks and the pass over EI Camino
Real.
