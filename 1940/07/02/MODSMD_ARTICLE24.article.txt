# Thieves Take $50 From Row Houses
## 
### 
A person or persons unknown pos
j sensed of more nerve than honesty,
Saturday night entered two frater
nity houses and stole a wrist watch
1 and money totaling $60.
Entering the A.T.O. and Beta
houses after the occupants had re
tired, the prowler made his way
[ systematically through all open
rooms, emptying wallets of all cash
aside from small change.
Frank Guthrie, former sports edi
tor of the Stanford Daily, lost a
wrist watch to the pil/erer, and his
A.T.O. fraternity brothers lost $50
in cash.
Men living in the Beta house re
ported a total of $10 missing from
their wallets. Indications are that
the same person or persons were
involved in both burglaries.
