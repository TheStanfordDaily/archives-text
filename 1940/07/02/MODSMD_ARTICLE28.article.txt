### 
Dr. Alfred Bellinger, of the Yale
university department of classics, in
his lecture on the comedies of Aris
tophanes last night said that what
nay not seem humorous to twen
tieth century Americans was ex
• remely comical to the ancient
Greeks. He particularly emphasized
■he importance of the chorus in
Greek drama, explaining that actors
•.nd dialogue were just accessories to
comedy, which originated with the
chorus.
Comedies of the time of Aristopha
nes were always presented in con
junction with some religious festi
val, usually in honor of Dionysus,
he said. of Aristopha
nes were serious in the beauty of
description.
Aristophanes, he pointed out, was
a pious man who disliked too much
conjecture about the gods and con
stantly expressed a desire for peace.
Aristophanes constantly poked fun
it all the great people of his day,
especially Euripides, the great tra
gedian, he reminded his audience.
"His comedies have slight plot but
great lyric value," he said. "Many
of the obscenities he used were not
considered immoral by the people of
his time.
