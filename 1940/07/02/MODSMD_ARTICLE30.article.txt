## 
### 
John Driscoll, '40, Cardinal ski
star and amateur pilot, is, to date,
the only Stanford flyer to qualify for
the advanced acrobatic flying course
being given by the Civil Aeronautics
Commission at the Palo Alto Air
port this summer.
Thirteen other graduates of the
primary training course given by the
C.AA. at Stanford this past year
have been notified of their eligi
bility for (he advanced course, which
consists of acrobatic and cross-coun
try flying training plus an extensive
ground schooling.
From these fourteen, who have
been selected as the best pilots out of
the seventy students in the primary
course, seven will ultimately be se

lected for training. Their selection
will be determined by means of an
exacting physical examination simi
lar to the one given by the United
States Army Air Service.
The course will consist of 40 hours
of training in advanced flying tech
nique to be given in conjunction
with a 145-hour ground school. The
training will be conducted in a two
seater Waco biplane, particularly
built for acrobatics.
At the conclusion of the instruc
tion the pilots will have accom
plished the equivalent of the primary
flying course given by the army air
service.
Although no definite decision has
yet been made by the C.A.A., it is

believed that commercial licenses,
customarily requiring a total of 200
hours of flying time, will be issued
to the graduates of the course.
