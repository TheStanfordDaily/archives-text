# Dr. Rawles Colors Chicks
## Embryonic Miracle Changes Feathers 
### 
Spotted baby chicks are the latest
of the newcomers to the Stanford
campus. In the anatomy laborator
ies numerous white leghorn chicks
are proudly displaying feather col
orings of crows and pheasants.
Dr. Mary E. Rawles, research as
sociate at the University of Roch
ester, N.Y., is now carrying experi
mental work in the Stanford anat
omy department. In this work, col
or-making cellff are transplanted
from embryo chicks to the backs or
wings of other embryos. After the
implantation the foreign pigments
are fused into the cells in the new
host.
Coloring cells from crows, rob
ins, and pheasants have been suc
cessfully changed, although almost
any bird is a capable donor.
The oddest part of the experiments
is in the adult stage. Gradually the
features change from the trans
planted figuring to the coloring the
bird normally would have had.
This change is in direct contradic
tion of the results obtained by Dr.
Charles Danforth, professor of anat
omy at Stanford. In his tests Dr.
Danforth transplants entire skin
surfaces after the chick has hatched,
and has found then that the change
is permanent. Investigation is now
being made to determine what
causes the embryonic cells to lose
their power in the adult develop
ment.
Dr. Rawles began her work on
feather pigmentation at the Univer
isty of Rochester under the direction
of Dr. B. H. Willier, who was with
the anatomy department at Stanford
last year. She has been continuing
her work here with Dr. Danforth.
