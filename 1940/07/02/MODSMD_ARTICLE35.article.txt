## WARMERDAM VAULTS TO NEW WORLD RECORD 
### 

CORNELIUS
WARMERDAM
again startled the
sporting world by
soaring up over
15 feet for a new
world's record.
Once before he did
the impossible
by reaching 15 feet
in a meet at
Berkeley. This time
he had 4 inches
to spare when lie
topped the bar in
his first attempt
at this height,
observers say.
Further vaulting
will be out of the
question, according
to Warmerdam, for
he announced that
he is not going to
compete in any
more meets.
