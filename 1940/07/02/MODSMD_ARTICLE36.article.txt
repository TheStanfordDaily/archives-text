# Stanford Thinclads Help Olympic Club in A.A. Win
## 
### 
Stanford and former Fann track- i
men helped San Francisco's power
ful Olympic Club bring the A.A.U.
championship to the Pacific Coast
Saturday, but it was the winged
feet of Hal Davis, Salinas Junior
College sprinter, thai captured the
spotlight in the Fresno meet.
Only a freshman, - and sought by
every major California school, Davis
earned the title of the "fastest hu
man," last year held by Stanford's
Clyde Jeffrey, by taking both the
'JOO- and 200-meter dashes. His 10.3
was a new A.A.U. mark and just
one-tenth of a second off Jesse
Owens' world standard.
Davis then came back io estab
jish a new A.A.U. record of 20.4
seconds, just one-tenth of a second
off Jesse Owens' standard and the
second fastest race ever run in the
United States. Jeffrey did not com
pete as he pulled a muscle in the
N.C.2-A. championships last week.
Last year, in the Fresno meet,
Clyde equaled Jesse Owens' mark
of 10.2 in the 100-meter dash but
the mark was not allowed as there
was a favorable wind blowing with
him. Some of the experts believe
Jeff, in shape, might have given
Davis real competition.
Paul Moore, running in the fastest
company he has had to contend with
f.ll season, was third in the 1500-
meter. The event was won by Walter
Mehl of Wisconsin. Glenn- Cun
ningham, the Kansas tornado, mak
ing one of his semi-monthly fare
well appearances, came in a close
second.
Stan Anderson, Stanford's shot-put
record holder at over 55 feet, was
good for a second to A1 Blozis of
Georgetown University, the boy
who heaved the shot out for a new
record last week at the N.C.2-A.
meet. Andy put the iron ball out
for a distance of 52 feet 37*8 inches,
while Blozis' mark was 55 feet %
inch.

► In the discus, Phil Fox (ne Levy),
[former Indian weight man, won with
| a colossal heave of 170:4V2 feet. Ol
| lie Cornett, another Stanford man,
I came in sixth in this event with a
I toss of 152: V 2 feet. Blozis, the spec
! tacular shot-putter, finished second
1 with a mark of 162:% feet. Blozis
| competed under the banner of the
New York A.C.
In third place behind another
Stanford man, Cornelius Warmer
dam, the high flyer of Fresno who
set a new world record in the pole
vault at 15:1 « feet, was Bud Dea
kin, once an Indian bamboo artist.
Gordon "Slinger" Dunn, also a
former Card great in the field events,
was fifth in the discus and sixth in
the shot put—but he competed for
the Multnomah A.C. of Portland.
Dunn tossed the plate out for a
count of 154:10 3 /4 feet.
Les Steers, a Palo Alto athlete
who practiced for many a year out
on Angell Field, but who is now
ticketed to go elsewhere, won the
high jump at 6:8% feet. This mark
betters the national senior A.A.U.
record of 6:8 r, s feet held by Johnson,
Albritton and Marty. Albritton, who
was also competing in this event, was
unable to come up to his own mark
and placed fourth with a leap of
6:4V2 feet, after four attempts.
Grover Klemmer, California's
great freshman, became the nation's
top man in the 400-meter dash with
a 47-second-flat race, outdistancing
his frosh rivel from U.S.C., Cliff
Bourland, who was third.
Freddie Wolcott, the Rice Insti
tute ace, was a double winner, break
ing a record and tying another when
he raced to 13.9 and 22.6 victories
in the high and low hurdles. In the
highs, Freddie chopped three-tenths
of a second off the official A.A.U.
mark and two-tenths off the Ameri
can record, both held by Forrest
Towns.
