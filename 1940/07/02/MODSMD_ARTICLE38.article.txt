# Stanford Ways Reviewed For Newer Students
## Founder's Request Still in Observance On Stanford Quad 
### 
In order that new students in the
summer quarter may become fa
miliar with traditions familiar to
regular students, the following are
four of the outstanding.
1. The tradition most integrally
connected with all branches of work
and play at Stanford is the Honor-
Code. It applies to examinations,
j term papers and themes, use of the
| library, and social regulations. Un
| der the honor system, the professor
distributes his questions at the be
! gining of an examination, then re-
I tires. Students are free to leave the
i room or to write the examinations
] elsewhere.
In sororities and smaller dormi
j lories there is no night chaperone,
I and women students are on their

honor to come in by 2:30 o'clock and
turn themselves into Council if they
are late.
The pledge, "No unpermitted aid
given or received," is signed by the
student at the end of every exam
ination or written paper used as r.
basis for grading.
2. Mrs. Stanford requested thai
students should not smoke inside the
Quadrangles or on the arcades so
that the Quad could be kept clean.
For almost 50 years Stanford mer
and women have respected hei
wish.
3. The friendly democratic spirit
of Stanford is characterized by the
"Hello" tradition. The campus is
pervaded by a spirit of friendliness
and everywhere they meet students
exchange a congenial "hello."
4. Diagonally across from English
Corner on the campus and on the
corners along University Avenue in
Palo Alto, Stanford students stand
and wait for rides to and from Pale
Alto. The "Ride to Paly" tradition
has long been upheld, and anyone,
student or professor, with an Indian
sticker on his car, stops and gives
a lift to earless students.
After almost 50 years of conduct:
under the Stanford code, more than
45,000 former students have been ce
mented into a loyal group of men
and women who carry the Stanford
spirit with them throughout their
later years.
