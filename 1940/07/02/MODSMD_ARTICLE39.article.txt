ig "on tour" this summer. Under
•le name of Roadrunners Produc
ions, ten Farm theatrical stars have

ratti, also currently prominent in
rm dramatics, complete the com
any.
LAN INDIVIDUALITY
The group have high hopes of
.Taking their own individual marks
.1 the theatrical profession with their
novel idea of making good individu
ally by breaking in as a company.
Their new method of play pro
duction has some of the elements of
fhe old medieval traveling players,
1 that I heir sets and costumes are
mtained in a traveling playhouse,
lore unromantically known as a
uck and trailer arrangement.
The truck contains shower and
ishroom facilities, with hot and
Id running water, bunks for the
?n, lockers and make-up room for
e company, a complete light-booth,
id an observation car.
The trailer houses the feminine
embers of the group and carries
ie sets, tent, benches for the au
ence (seating capacity is 420), and
l properties, furnishings, and cos
ines. Once unloaded, one side of

the trailer hinges down and turns
into a stage fifteen feet deep and
eight feet high.
TO OPEN IN PALY
The "Roadrunners" plan to open
in Palo Alto July 12, and then move
on to Lake Tahoe. From there the
company has planned what sounds
like an old-time stock-tour. Carson
City, Fallon, Lovelock, Winnemucca,
Elko, Twin Falls, Pocatello, and
Brigham are some of the planned
stops.
The opening production in Palo
Alto will be 'Yes, My Darling
Daughter," and additional plays
planned include "Journey's End,"
"Night Must Fall," "Kind Lady," and
a variety show pieced together from
Stanford Big Game Gaieties and
spring musicals.
