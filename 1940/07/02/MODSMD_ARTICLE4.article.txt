## 
### 
An English motion picture, "The
Challenge," is scheduled for the
next program in the Tuesday Eve
ning Series. It will be presented in
the auditorium of Memorial Hall
tonight at 8 o'clock.
The plot revolves around a hu
man being who pits himself against
the mighty Matterhorn between the
frontiers of Italy and Switzerland.
The mountain itself is in reality the
hero of the story, and provides an
allegory for man's unending fight
against the relentless forces of na
ture.
The snowy peak of the mighty
mountain, which throughout the
ages has defied aggressive moun
taineers and the conquest of its 14,-
782 feet, serves as the historical
background. Many of these realistic
and magnificent scenes were actu
ally photographed on the Matter
horn.
The cast includes Robert Douglas,
Joan Gardner, Luis Trenker, and
Mary Clare. The art director is Vin
cent Korda, and the outstanding
photography is by George Perinal.
It has been said that the real hero
of this picture is the cameraman.
