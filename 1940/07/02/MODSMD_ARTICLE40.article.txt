# Stanford Historians Publish Documented Russian Analysis
## 
### 
One of the countless casualties of<
the World War was the Second In
ternational.
Its crisis and the origin and early
history of the Third, or Communist,
International make up the subject
matter of a book entitled, "The Bol
sheviks and the World War" pub
lished this week by the Stanford
University Press. The authors are
Olga Hess Gankin and H. H. Fisher
of Stanford University.
Dr. Fisher is professor of history
and vice-chairman of the board of
directors of the Hoover Library on
War, Revolution, and Peace. Mrs.
Gankin is a research associate of the
Russian Revolution Institute of the
Hoover Library.
COLLABORATE FOR SIX YEARS
As authorities on the history of
revolutionary Russia, Mrs. Gankin
and Dr. Fisher collaborated for six
years in producing the volume, the
purpose of which, in their own
words, is to make available in Eng
lish a collection ot documents on the
origin ol the Third International.
There have been short histories in
Ejiglish covering the same subject,
but none have been documented.
Much of the narrative is woven
around the heroic figure of Lenin,
father of the Third International, and
his attempts to organize the Leftists
within the disintegrating Second.
From a purely objective viewpoint,
the book traces the growth of the
ideas which broke up the Second In
ternational and later served as a
theoretical base for its successor. It
draws no lessons from the troubled
period it reviews.
LENIN URGES LEFTISTS
As representatives of the extreme
Left within the Second Interna
tional, the Bolsheviks headed by
Lenin fought the reformist tendency
within that International. When at
the outbreak of the World War the

►constituent parties of the Second In
ternational failed to oppose the war
measures ot their governments and
to take advantage, of the situation to
promote the cause of Socialism,
Lenin and his followers denounced
| this betrayal, as they regarded it, of
the workers, and urged the Leftists
of all countries to break with their
party majorities and join in the es
tablishment of a new and truly revo
lutionary International.
This campaign was carried on un
der i;)'eat difficulties in small gath
ering?, by letters, by pamphlets and
in fugitive periodicals which, reached
the readers to whom they were ad
dressed only when they escaped the
vigilance of the police.
The drive by the Russian Bolshe
viks for a new International is fol
lowed in detail by this study. Docu
ments given relate to Bolshevik
party affairs, to the international
conferences of the Zimmerwald
movement, the activities of its ex
ecutive body, the International So
cialist Committee at Berne, and
particularly the affairs of the Zim
merwald Left, organizational base of
the Bolsheviks. They include letters,
newspaper articles, excerpts from
propaganda leaflets and parts of
other publications.
A good deal of the source mate
rial for the books is now on the
shelves of the Hoover Library. Some
is owned, while other documents
were borrowed either from Soviet
libraries or American and European
libraries and educational founda
tions.
Since many of the documents do
not in themselves carry on a narra
tive of the events to which they re
late, an account of these events ac
companies each group of documents.
This volume does not go beyond
the autumn of 1918. Preparations for
the establishment of the Third In
ternational and its first Congress in
1919 will be discussed, the authors
announce in the preface, in a forth
coming volume entitled, "The Bol

Since many of the documents do
not in themselves carry on a narra

late, an account of these events ac
companies each group of documents.
This volume does not go beyond
the autumn of 1918. Preparations for
the establishment of the Third In
ternational and its first Congress in
1919 will be discussed, the authors
announce in the preface, in a forth
coming volume entitled, "The Bol
sheviks and World Revolution: The
Founding of the Third International."
One of the countless casualties of<
the World War was the Second In
ternational.
Its crisis and the origin and early
history of the Third, or Communist,
International make up the subject
matter of a book entitled, "The Bol
sheviks and the World War" pub
lished this week by the Stanford
University Press. The authors are
Olga Hess Gankin and H. H. Fisher
of Stanford University.
Dr. Fisher is professor of history
and vice-chairman of the board of
directors of the Hoover Library on
War, Revolution, and Peace. Mrs.
Gankin is a research associate of the
Russian Revolution Institute of the
Hoover Library.
COLLABORATE FOR SIX YEARS
As authorities on the history of
revolutionary Russia, Mrs. Gankin
and Dr. Fisher collaborated for six
years in producing the volume, the
purpose of which, in their own
words, is to make available in Eng
lish a collection ot documents on the
origin ol the Third International.
There have been short histories in
Ejiglish covering the same subject,
but none have been documented.
Much of the narrative is woven
around the heroic figure of Lenin,
father of the Third International, and
his attempts to organize the Leftists
within the disintegrating Second.
From a purely objective viewpoint,
the book traces the growth of the
ideas which broke up the Second In
ternational and later served as a
theoretical base for its successor. It
draws no lessons from the troubled
period it reviews.
LENIN URGES LEFTISTS
As representatives of the extreme
Left within the Second Interna
tional, the Bolsheviks headed by
Lenin fought the reformist tendency
within that International. When at
the outbreak of the World War the

►constituent parties of the Second In
ternational failed to oppose the war
measures ot their governments and
to take advantage, of the situation to
promote the cause of Socialism,
Lenin and his followers denounced
| this betrayal, as they regarded it, of
the workers, and urged the Leftists
of all countries to break with their
party majorities and join in the es
tablishment of a new and truly revo
lutionary International.
This campaign was carried on un
der i;)'eat difficulties in small gath
ering?, by letters, by pamphlets and
in fugitive periodicals which, reached
the readers to whom they were ad
dressed only when they escaped the
vigilance of the police.
The drive by the Russian Bolshe
viks for a new International is fol
lowed in detail by this study. Docu
ments given relate to Bolshevik
party affairs, to the international
conferences of the Zimmerwald
movement, the activities of its ex
ecutive body, the International So
cialist Committee at Berne, and
particularly the affairs of the Zim
merwald Left, organizational base of
the Bolsheviks. They include letters,
newspaper articles, excerpts from
propaganda leaflets and parts of
other publications.
A good deal of the source mate
rial for the books is now on the
shelves of the Hoover Library. Some
is owned, while other documents
were borrowed either from Soviet
libraries or American and European
libraries and educational founda
tions.
