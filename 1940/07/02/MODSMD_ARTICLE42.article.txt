# Bailey Urges Go Slow Policy
## Fears U.S. Thinks With Heart, Not Head 
### 
Addressing a meeting of 400 last
Friday evening at the Palo Alto
High School Auditorium, Dr. Thomas
A. Bailey, Stanford history professor,
charged the administration with a
lack of * perspective in the present
crisis. He urged an attitude of
realism toward the war.
The American people since the be
ginning of their history have been
prone to "think wiih their hearts
instead of their heads," Dr. Bailey
asserted. Now, he said, they should
face realistically the problem before
them.
The historian said we must not
send aid to the Allies to the extent
of crippling ourselves or becoming
drawn into the conflict. Our army
today is too inconsequential to tip
the scales on the side of Britain,
"Our army will do more good
based in America than destroyed on
the other side," he added. "One
thing worse than missing a bus is
running to catch a bus which has
broken down."
