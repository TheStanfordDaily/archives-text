# Earth's Crust Measure Begun
## Wisconsin, M.I.T. Men Study Mine Vibrations 
### 
Scientists of two of America's
leading universities—the University
of Wisconsin and Massachusetts In
stitute of Technology—are co-oper
ating this summer in the work of
determining the thickness of the
earth's crust in the Middle West by
recording the ground vibrations
through the seismic method.
The joint enterprise, which is
headed by Professors L. R. Inger
soll, physics department, and Stan
ley A. Tyler, geology department,
both of Wisconsin, and Professor
Louis B. Slichter and Dr. C. L. Pe
keris, both of Massachusetts Insti
tute of Technology, is sponsored by
the Wisconsin Alumni Research
Foundation and the Geological So
ciety of America. Co-operating with
the scientists are certain large quar
ries and mining companies in the
Middle West area.
EARTH'S THICKNESS
The scientists have been trying to
discover whether layers of the
earth's crust are the same thickness
in different parts of the continent, or
whether the thickness varies con
siderably in local regions. This type
of work, which has fundamental
geological significance, has already
been carried on in New England and
in California.
Vicinities throughout Wisconsin
and adjoining states are now being
used as the experimenting ground
by the scientists. With the co-oper
ation of quarry companies through
out this area, the scientists record
the slight tremors from the distant
quarry blasts by a group of portable
seismographs spaced equally over a
line extending several hundred
miles from the blast.
By means of radio time signals,
the time is recorded at each of the
12 seismic instruments. The instru
ments record ground vibrations.
When the wave tremors generated
by the blast travel downward
through solid rock of crust, they
gradually bend back at the surface
after traveling 20 or 30 miles into
the earth.
WAVES CARRY STORY
The waves that are sent down to
the pulse of the earth come out car
rying a story with them—a story
which enables the scientists to de
termine the types of rock layers that
are encountered. By this method it
is possible to measure the velocity of
waves at various and successive
depths in the earth's crust —making
it possible to identify the rock.
The general thickness of the
earth's crust has not as yet been
fully explored and the third geo
logical dimension — the penetration
of the earth's crust—will eventually
be solved by these scientific studies.
The investigation methods to
measure the earth's shell, which are
being carried on by these scientists,
are analogous to oil prospecting on
the smaller scale and the seismo
graphjc method of determining the
tremors of an earthquake on a larg
er scale.

Stanford's endowment last year
was in excess of $31,000,000.
