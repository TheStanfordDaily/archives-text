# Dr. Gamow Writes On Solar System
## 
### 
Published last week was a volume
by George Gainow, visiting professor
of physics at Stanford during sum
mer of 1936. Entitled "The Birth and
Death of the Sun," it is a physicist's
explanation of the solar system.
Dr. Gamow's book propounds his
own theory of stellar constitution
and evolution. The professor has
concluded that the sun's transforma-

tion of hydrogen to helium furnished
the energy which we see as light.
He further believes that when the
supply of hydrogen is exhausted, the
sun will begin its disintegration. This
he estimates will have occurred by
10,000,000,000 A.D.
Professor Gamow earned the Ph.D.
at the University of Leningrad in
1926, and since 1934 he has been pro
fessor of physics at George Wash
ington University.
