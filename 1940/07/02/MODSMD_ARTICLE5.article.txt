threat to America?" was the ques
tion asked by Dr. Anthony Sokol,
associate professor of eGrmanic lan
guages at Stanford, in his speech be
fore the Institute of International

"Speaking purely as a strate
i gist," Professor Sokol told his au
j dience, "I would say that there is
| no way for Germany to attack vis
unless she gets bases closer to our
shores. I would say, therefore, that
as long as Germany doesn't move
j into Icelan, Greenland or Canada, or
the Azores, Bermuda or some West
I Indies ase, there is no chance for her
to attack us at all."
Professor Sokol asserted that
Americans must realize that Hitler is
j a realist.
"Everything he lias done has been
planned and done according to
schedule," he declared. "The Allies
have been the dreamers. The Amer
icans must become realistic too. so
! they won't be caught in the same
| trap."
