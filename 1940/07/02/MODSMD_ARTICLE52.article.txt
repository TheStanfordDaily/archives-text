Comes now the time of year when*
it is not the thing to walk up behind
your friend and seize him by the
arm—at least the left arm. On ac
count of the vaccinators having been
pretty busy lately. Friends, this is
a way to drag another grand old
Stanford tradition into the light for
those who are here this summer for
the first time: if you want to go to
Stanford you become host to a few
million cox poxlets.

Eighty campus children are en
joying swimming classes sponsored
by the women's physical education
department, announced Mrs. Maud
Knapp, director. There are classes
for ages 5-7 and 8-12, both sexes;
13-16, girls. Idea originated two
years ago, classes growing each year.
Other things besides swimming are
being added, golf, for instance. But
the classes are about full now, said
the director.
* * *
If this doesn't look like a way to
save five dollars, please try to pre
tend it is anyway, because it really
does come under the general head
ing of a Fine Thing. Demonstration
school started classes yesterday at
the campus school at Lasuen and
Santa Inez Streets. It is the second
year and Miss Lelia Ann Taggert is
again in charge. Close is August 9.
If you are a regularly enrolled Stan
ford student, your child's tuition is
only $15; otherwise, $20. Excellent
training for the children and they
love it; also fine for education stu
dents to observe. More about it
later.
