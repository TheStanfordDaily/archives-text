# T. Z. Koo Lauds Chinese Effort
## Leader Cites 'Resist Fight, Rebuild' Slogan 
### 
"Resist, fight, build nation" is the
slogan and traditional outlook of the
Chinese people, said Dr. T. Z. Koo
in his sermon at the Memorial
Church last Sunday. Dr. Koo is a
leader in the movement for the pro
motion of friendly relations among
the Pacific nations.
The Chinese people, Dr. Koo said,
have gone on building and rebuilding
colleges and churches during the
war, realizing the need for a stream
of educated leadership, rather than
soldiers. As the result of the bomb
ing of colleges, students have moved
to the western part of China and
constructed buildings of mud and
straw, and have gone on with their
learning.
At least 25.000 students have per
sisted in their efforts to continue
their education, and most of these
are forced to subsist on a monthly
food allowance equal to about 85
cents in our money, Dr. Koo as
serted.
Chinese students, he said, have
turned to both Christianity and the
older Chinese religions as a result
of the present situation.
China has lost very little as a re
sult of the war, the speaker said.
Actually, she has gained immeasur
ably due to her belated recognition
of the fact that as Chinese her peo
ple belong to the Chinese race, while
as Christians they belong to a world
wide brotherhood.
