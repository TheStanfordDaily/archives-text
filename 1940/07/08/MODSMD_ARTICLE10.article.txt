## Author Scrambles Fact, Fiction in Play

ford Division of Speech and Drama
will be producing Leon Pearson's
sly satire on Washington politics
while the Democratic party is holding
its national convention. And the
question that troubles Sam Anders,
"Mr. Congressman," will be settled
at the time.
What bothers Sam is trie 8-year
old problem of whether it is better
to be a New Dealer or a Democrat.
When he decided that the New Deal
ers are not politicians of the old
order, Sam runs into re-election dif
ficulties, one of which is Anita, the
lady from Cuba.
Leon Pearson gathered the mate
rial for his timely comedy from his
newspaper experiences in Washing
ton as correspondent for a chain of
Latin American newspapers.
BEHIND THE SCENES'
By scrambling the events and in
venting characters, he was able to
write a biting comment on behind
the-scenes life in Washington. Con
gressman Anders' situation is the
same as that of other Democrats
who have had to face New Deal
"purges."
The jovial politician, played by
Virgil Whitaker, has to run the
gauntlet of threats his enemies hold
over his head. Aside from an in
criminating picture addressed to
Anita, he is worried by the actions
of his son who is accused of accept
ing a bribe to help some friend into
West Point. H. B. Lee will play the

role of the congressman's son.
Bob Burnett has been cast in the
role of Andrew March, naturally
from Harvard and one of the presi
dent's trigger men. With the ap
pointment of Jack Temple and
Herbert Williamson to the role of
the newspapermen, the casting of
"Mr. Congressman" is complete.
First performance of the play will
be next. Monday evening in the Little
Theater at 8 o'clock. Succeeding per
formances will be given at the same
time on Wednesday, Thursday, Fri
day, and Saturday of next week.
