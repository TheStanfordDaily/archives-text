# Sparducks Top 'Chair' League Softball Clubs
## Socialists in Second Place; Five Teams In Tie for Third Spot 
### 
After a hectic two successive days
of everything but high class baseball,
the Sparducks from Oregon wound
up on top of the Wheel Chair
League standings at the conclusion
of the second week of play last
Friday.
Beating the Accordions in a close
game on Tuesday, 3 to 2, and then
repeating the next day with a re
sounding 16 to 6 win over the fac
ulty team of Slavedrivers, the web
footed lads now repose in a two-way
tie for top place on the well-matched
league's won and lost column.
Right on their heels are the So
cialists, whose opening day game
with the rumored Foreign Legion
was postponed, but whose easy vic
tory over the Red Gappers, 8 to 4,
and not-so-easy win over the brawny
Agonists, 5 to 3, left them with a
record of two won and none lost
for a percentage tie for the top spot.
TIE FOR THIRD PLACE
A five-way tie for third place pre
vails. The Agonists, who play base
ball like the good footballers most of
them once were, landed among the
third-place sextet by romping all
over Greer's Greasers 16 to 11, and
then losing the following day to the
Socialists.
The Slavedrivers moved out of
last place with two successive vic
tories, shutting out the Accordions 4
to 0, and beating the Outlaws 5 to 1.
Also tied for third, and but one game
out of first, are Greer's Greasers,
Toro Bulls, and the Prune Pickers.
Shivering in the league's cellar are
the New Dealers —which may be a
prophetic note for political things to
come—and the Accordions, who have
taken their name literally and folded
on three occasions to date.
FOREIGN LEGION LOST
Somewhere below the cellar, if
anywhere, is the Foreign Legion, an
aggregation which has so far given
evidence of being more of a myth
ical than a physical entity. They
have yet to show for any one of
their scheduled contests. Boss Harry

Shipkey expresses some concern for
their welfare and hopes that one of
the boys will drop around and re
assure him that all is well with the
members of the ghost team.

game on Tuesday, 3 to 2, and then
repeating the next day with a re
sounding 16 to 6 win over the fac
ulty team of Slavedrivers, the web
footed lads now repose in a two-way
tie for top place on the well-matched
league's won and lost column.
Right on their heels are the So
cialists, whose opening day game
with the rumored Foreign Legion
was postponed, but whose easy vic
tory over the Red Gappers, 8 to 4,
and not-so-easy win over the brawny
Agonists, 5 to 3, left them with a
record of two won and none lost
for a percentage tie for the top spot.
TIE FOR THIRD PLACE
A five-way tie for third place pre
vails. The Agonists, who play base
ball like the good footballers most of
them once were, landed among the
third-place sextet by romping all
over Greer's Greasers 16 to 11, and
then losing the following day to the
Socialists.
The Slavedrivers moved out of
last place with two successive vic
tories, shutting out the Accordions 4
to 0, and beating the Outlaws 5 to 1.
Also tied for third, and but one game
out of first, are Greer's Greasers,
Toro Bulls, and the Prune Pickers.
Shivering in the league's cellar are
the New Dealers —which may be a
prophetic note for political things to
come—and the Accordions, who have
taken their name literally and folded
on three occasions to date.
FOREIGN LEGION LOST
Somewhere below the cellar, if
anywhere, is the Foreign Legion, an
aggregation which has so far given
evidence of being more of a myth
ical than a physical entity. They
have yet to show for any one of
their scheduled contests. Boss Harry

Shipkey expresses some concern for
their welfare and hopes that one of
the boys will drop around and re
assure him that all is well with the
members of the ghost team.
