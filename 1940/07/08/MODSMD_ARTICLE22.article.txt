## Dr. Terman Asserts Precocious Children Most Apt to Succeed

Latest developments in Dr. Lewis
M. Terman's study of gifted children,
begun 20 years ago, were explained
by the famous Stanford psychologist
before the Education Club on July 2.
Dr. Terman, convinced that many
of the popular opinions about pre
cocious children were not correct,
determined to make a follow-up
study of bright children. He found
it necessary to study a large group
and have a true sampling; thus,
whatever held true for that group
would hold true for any similar
group.
The children selected had an I.Q.
of 140 or better. It was found that
these gifted children as a whole
were more versatile and physically
superior to the average child.
GRADES HIGH
Through subsequent follow-ups,
Dr. Terman found that two-thirds of
the children's marks in high school
were A's and that there were no
subject failures. Of the group, 90
per cent entered college and grad
uated, with honors exceedingly
prevalent. Although 30 flunked out
of college, most of them returned and
graduated.
The final follow-up last year
showed that the group, as a group,
was just as intelligent as ever, and
there were few cases of genuine de
terioration. The mortality and in
sanity rates were a good deal lower
than the average, while the suicide
rates were only slightly lower. The
group is in the upper part of the
population, and 75 to 80 per cent of
the men are in a profession.
The most important variable, the
speaker declared, is the child's abil
ity of personalityâ€”that is, his power
to adjust himself to the world about
him. Whatever differences exist in
terms of success will have to be ac
counted for by personality.
