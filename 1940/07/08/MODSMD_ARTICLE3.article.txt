# Farm Plans For 50th Birthday
## Festivities to Include Dedication, Pageant 
### 
October 1, 1891, was the day of
the opening of Stanford University,
and next year will be the Fiftieth
Anniversary celebration.
Throughout the year will be a
series of commemoration celebrating
significant dates in the University's
history, starting with the recognition
of Founders Day on March 9.
Although detailed plans are yet to
be made, provisional plans have been
submitted by Dr. Robert E. Swain,
chairman of the general committee.
On May 14, which is the anniver
sary of Stanford's birthday, there
will be recognition of the anniversary
of the laying of the cornerstone of
the University in 1887. In the week
following Commencement in June, is
scheduled a formal academic fes
tival, to which delegates of from 800
to 1,000 institutions of learning will
be invited, as well as distinguished
scholars and men of affairs.
During the same week will be a
dedication of the Hoover Library on
War, Revolution and Peace. At the
same time, it is hoped, there will be
inaugurated a series of conferences.
It is hoped that also, during this
week, there will be an outdoor
pageant recognizing historical events
of the University. The pageant will
be an epic poem written for the
purpose, with appropriate accom
paniments. The theme of the pageant
is to be "Ideas of Free Education
in America." It is hoped that the
epic will be published and revived
periodically at Stanford.
Immediately following these events
will be a series of conferences in the
various fields of learning and public
affairs. The conferences will extend
into the summer quarter.
Commemoration of the fiftieth an
niversary of the opening of the uni
versity will be held during the first
days of October. These events will
be less formal in character than the
previous ones. It will be more of a
Stanford "family affair," with an es
pecial appeal to the faculty, students,
alumni and friends of the university.
The general committee on com
memoration under which various
committees will function is headed
by the following:
Joseph D. Grant, trustee, honor
ary chairman; Dr. Robert E. Swain,
chairman; Dr. Don Tresidder, co
chairman, and Frank F. Walker, co
chairman.

October 1, 1891, was the day of
the opening of Stanford University,
and next year will be the Fiftieth
Anniversary celebration.
Throughout the year will be a
series of commemoration celebrating
significant dates in the University's
history, starting with the recognition
of Founders Day on March 9.
Although detailed plans are yet to
be made, provisional plans have been
submitted by Dr. Robert E. Swain,
chairman of the general committee.
On May 14, which is the anniver
sary of Stanford's birthday, there
will be recognition of the anniversary
of the laying of the cornerstone of
the University in 1887. In the week
following Commencement in June, is
scheduled a formal academic fes
tival, to which delegates of from 800
to 1,000 institutions of learning will
be invited, as well as distinguished
scholars and men of affairs.
During the same week will be a
dedication of the Hoover Library on
War, Revolution and Peace. At the
same time, it is hoped, there will be
inaugurated a series of conferences.
It is hoped that also, during this
week, there will be an outdoor
pageant recognizing historical events
of the University. The pageant will
be an epic poem written for the
purpose, with appropriate accom
paniments. The theme of the pageant
is to be "Ideas of Free Education
in America." It is hoped that the
epic will be published and revived
periodically at Stanford.
Immediately following these events
will be a series of conferences in the
various fields of learning and public
affairs. The conferences will extend
into the summer quarter.
Commemoration of the fiftieth an
niversary of the opening of the uni
versity will be held during the first
days of October. These events will
be less formal in character than the
previous ones. It will be more of a
Stanford "family affair," with an es
pecial appeal to the faculty, students,
alumni and friends of the university.
