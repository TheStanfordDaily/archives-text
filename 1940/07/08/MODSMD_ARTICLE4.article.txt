# 'Movie Music' Subject Of Tuesday Series
## Audience Will Hear Recent Movie Scores 
### 
George Antheil, composer-in-resi
dence and lecturer in music, will
speak on "Music of the Movies" in
the Tuesday Evening Series tonight
at 8 o'clock in the Auditorium of
Memorial Hall. Mr. Antheil will il
lustrate his lecture with sequences
from recent motion pictures.
Mr. Antheil believes that movie
music, under the right cii'cum
stances, can be as important a part
of our musical education as opera
because the listener subconsciously
absorbs the music while looking at
the picture and thus educates his
taste for music.
Deeply interested in the problems
of theater music, he has been advo
cating performances of operas in
English for the American public, no
matter what the nationality and
original language of the opera may
be.
INTERESTING OPERA
Mr. Antheil has long been a
champion of modernizing opera per
formances as to settings, acting, etc.,
and making them of more interest
than merely the listening to music
with closed eyes. Mr. Antheil has
been writing music for the movies
since 1935, starting as the music
director for Ben* Hecht and Charles
Mac Arthur at the eastern Para
mount Studios in Astoria, Long
Island.
MUSIC FOR MOVIES
From 1936 on, he wrote music for
such pictures as "The Plainsman"
and "The Buccaneer," both produced
by Cecil B. de Mille. He also wrote
the score for Leo McCarey's "Make
Way for Tomorrow."
His opera "Transatlantic" is one
of the very few operas written by an
American to be performed in the
German state theater. It was acted
in Frankfurt-am-Maine in 1930. He
was also assistant director of the Ber
lin State Theater in 1928-29.
Since 1936, he has been in Holly
wood with Paramount Pictures Cor
poration and other studios.
Mr. Antheil has been writing a
column on movie music for "Modern
Music." He has also written an ar
ticle for the Saturday Evening Post
on "behind the scenes" action in the
music departments of the Hollywood
movie studios, an article for the At
lantic Monthly called "Hollywood
Composer," and others.
