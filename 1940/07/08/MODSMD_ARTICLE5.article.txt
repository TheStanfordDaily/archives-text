## 
### 
The summer quarter Bawlout, or
the Directory of Officers and Stu
dents as it is officially named, came
from the press yesterday. It dis
closes interesting though not his
torically significant statistics.
Only 753 students are registered
for the summer quarter as compared
to an average attendance of 4,249 in
the three preceding quarters. Grad
uate students make up two-thirds of
the summer's enrollment, 495 being
registered along with an undergrad
uate remainder of 258. This com

other quarters.
PLENTY OF PROFS
One fact may strike a note of
happiness in the discordant life of
he l sweating summer student—he is
imply provided with teaching and
administrative officers. For every
•ncmber of the student body of 753,
there is approximately one officer,
the grand total of officers being 749.
Out of this total, 107 are professors,

an average of one professor to every
seven students.
By major subjects, the School of
Education leads in enrollment with
281. The Lower Division is second
with 115, followed by the Graduate
School of Business with 34, the De
partment of English 33, physical edu
cation and hygiene 30, the School of
Social Sciences 28, and the Depart
ment of Germanic Languages and
History, each with 24, completes the
list of leaders.
CALIFORNIA LEADS
California, with a representation
of 546 and approximately five-sev
onths of the total enrollment, leads

students, Arizona follows with 16,
Washington 15, Utah 14, Missouri 13,
Idaho 12, New York and Texas each

sas 7 each, and all other states and
