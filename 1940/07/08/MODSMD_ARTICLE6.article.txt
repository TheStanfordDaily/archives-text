### 
The $100,000 carillon now in the tower of the Belgian pavilion at the
New York World's Fair will chime in the new Hoover Library on War,
Revolution and Peace.
Miss Bernice Miller, secretary to Mr. Hoover, said that the gift was
made by "the Belgian people" in gratitude for Hoover's service in Belgian

'relief during the last World War.
The carillon, completed in 1938, is
said to be one of the most nearly
perfect in existence, with a very
large assembly of bells, unusually
clear in tone. It contains a larger
assemblage of bells than any carillon
in the United States. The carillon is
electrically operated.
As soon as the shaft in the new
library is completed, the bells will
be installed.
The library will house rare diplo
matic and historical documents from
the last war in addition to data of
