# Actors to Read Comedy Drama
## Dramatists' Series To Open Tomorrow 
### 
Wycherly's "The Gentleman Danc
ing Master," one of the gayest of the
Restoraton comedies, begins the
series of dramatic readings spon
sored again this summer by the
Dramatists' Alliance. It will be pro
duced this Wednesday at 8 o'clock in
the Education Auditorium.
Heading the cast of experienced
and well-known campus actors in
the role of Hippolita is Shirley Jones
Cady, popular star of numerous Big

Game Gaieties, and seen last sum
mer as Topsy in "Uncle Tom's
Cabin.' A professional sense of tim
ing and alert gaiety make her a per
fect expression of Wycherly's keen
wit.
Co-featured with her is Ralph
Shram, director of the Millbrae
Community Theater, who plays
Gerrard, the romantic lover, with
charm and convincing masculinity.
Hippolyta's watchful father, Mr.
Formal, or Don Diego as he chooses
to be called, is to be read by Clif
ford Hamar, who will be remem
bered in the part of John of Gaunt
in the recent Stanford production of
"Richard II."
SUPPORTING CAST STRONG
Supporting the central perform
ers are Marie Carr, instructor at San
Jose State College, as Prue, Hip
polita's saucy maid, Myna Brunton
Hughes, as Mrs. Caution, the harsh
and suspicious aunt of Hippolyta,
and Dr. Margery Bailey, as Mistress
Flounce.
Making his first campus appear
ance in the role of Monsieur de
Paris, an F.nglishman who would be
French, is Rodney Pain. Reading
stage directions and the parts of
various servants will be Wendall
Keck, who during the past year,
has appeared in readings patterned
after Stanford's at Moscow, Idaho,
where he is an instructor at the Uni
versity of Idaho.
"The Gentleman Dancing Master,"
although obscured by Wycherly's
biting satires, "The Country Wife,"
and "The Plain Dealer," is notable
for its racy spirit, the lightness of
its double entendre, and, although
the plot is taken in part from the i
Spanish, for the warmth of its sturdy !
English spirit.
