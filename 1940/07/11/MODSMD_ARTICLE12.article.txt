# Oregonians, Muscovites Top Softball League Standings

### 
With a slight improvement over previous games, the teams of the
mighty Wheel Chair League are showings promise of being able to play a
little softball. The Sparducks of Oregon and the Socialists of Moscow are
at present holding the top honors of the league.
The Sparducks maintained their lead in the league by whipping the

Foreign Legion, which, by the way,
didn't show up at all. Chief Worrier
Harry Shipkey is still wondering
what has become of this bunch and
has expressed the fear that they
have given up in terror after seeing
the competition they have to meet.
The Socialists plowed along at a
merry gait to take the Outlaws in
a blistering game, 4 to 1. This little
session turned out to be a duel of
pitchers and was featured by some
sharp ball-handling on the part of
the Socialists.
The Red Gappers (led by Ruggles
of course) pounded out an 11 to 6
victory over the Prunepickers. A
couple of two-baggers put the game
on ice early in the contest and the
rest of the time was put in merely
to humor the Prunepickers.
The Accordions astounded the
sporting world by knocking out a 12
to 4 victory over the New Dealers.
This was the first win for the Ac
cordions and "The Chief" sends his
compliments to them for over-riding
the fine pitching of W. H. Woody,
the pride and joy of the All-Stars.
After a long, hard fight, the Slave
drivers came through with the help
of Dean of Men John Bunn's spec
tacular ball snatching proclivities, to
eke out a win over the team com
monly known as Greer's Greasers.
The score was 6 to 4.
The Agonists continued their
football tactics in the softball field
and pounded out a win of 14 to 7
over the Toro Bulls. The game was
outstanding in that the boys were
called safe and out, etc., by a charm
ing member of the fair sex â€”yes one
of the graduates offered her services
as ump and the offer was taken up.
