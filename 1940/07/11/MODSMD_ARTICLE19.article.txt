# Stanford 'Kids' Write Scenario: 'Andy Hardy Meets Debutante'
## 
### 
HOLLYWOOD.—Every once in a
while, when you get depressed about
the thousands of people banging
vainly upon Hollywood's door, you
run into youngsters like Annalee
Whitmore and Thomas Seller.
Annalee graduated from Stanford
University in 1937. She was wom
an's editor of The Stanford Daily.
She wanted to be a movie writer,
but she knew that was out of the
question at the start. So she tried
to get a job as a $35-e-week reader
in a movie studio, looking over pos
sible picture stories.
That was no go. There were too
many eager young applicants, like
herself. Best she could do was a job
as a stenographer at Metro-Gold
wyn-Mayer. Even then she felt she
was lucky. That was last year. She
was 23.
Thomas was two years older, and
also a graduate of Stanford. He
wanted to be a writer, too. Only he
went to New York and nearly starv
ed trying to peddle radio scripts. He
sold a few, but the returns were
meager. So he went to Yale Univer
sity to take a post graduate course
in dramatic writing.
JUNIOR WRITERS
That also was last year and Metro
was sending its annual letters to
the major universities, asking them
if they had any likely looking grad
uates who'd be interested in becom
ing "junior writers." Pay would be
$50 a week, with a six-month con
tract. After that would be fame—
or oblivion. So Thomas was recom
mended, among some 500 other grad
uates from other schools. There
were elimination tests and Thomas
came to Hollywood with nine other
hopefuls.
So a year passes. Annalee is 24
now; Thomas is 26. Just released
is "Andy Hardy Meets Debutante."
Annalee Whitmore and Thomas Sel
ler wrote it. Their names are on the
screen as the authors, their salaries
already are in substratosphere brack
ets, they both have long-term con
tracts, they're working now on
"Ziegfeld Girl" — and if anybody
claims there is no opportunity for
youngsters in Hollywood, he's crazy.
ODDS STEEP
"Although I will admit the odds
against you are steep," Annalee re
ported at lunch. We sat with her on
one side, and Thomas on the other.
We wanted to learn how they be
came movie scenarists, while most
newly graduated collegians still were
looking for jobs.
"When I talk about odds, I mean
the odds against getting inside a pic
ture studio in the first place," Anna
lee said. "After you get in, the peo
ple are grand.
"They made me a secretary in the
writing department, because they
knew I wanted to write. I never let
anybody forget that. So for a year
I took dictation from Scott Fitzger
ald, William Ludwig, and other es

tablished writers. I couldn't help
'out learn the technique of putting
down words in movie script style. I
mean I learned the mechanics of pic
ture writing. And then Mervyn Le
roy gave me the chance to try my
hand with Thomas on 'Ziegfeld
Girl.' And then Cary Wilson bor
rowed both of us for the Hardy pic
ture."
Thomas said he spent his first
year in the studio, as a general
handyman in the writing depart
ment. He was a kind of figurative
pencil shapener. He didn't have any
thing to do, really, except learn
movie writing technique.
