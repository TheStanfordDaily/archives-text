# Speaker Gives Basic Standards In Broadcasting
## Mrs. Richardson Tells Radio Audience Of Free Speech Right 
### 
"Have you ever thought through
what you like or dislike about your
daily radio menu, and have you
passed along your opinion to help
the men and women who carry the
;ob of preparing radio programs on
regular schedules all year long?"
This was the challenge expressed
last night by Mrs. Inez G. Richard
son, curator of the Ray Lyman Wil
bur Collection on Social Problems in
the Hoover Library, in a broadcast
from station KPO in the Stanford
Universityâ€”On the Air program.
Mrs. Richardson is program co-ordi
nator of the California Conference
sponsored by the Federal Radio Ed
ucation Committee, which meets
here July 25-26.
"Radio, as our most important and
influential method of communica
tion, demands basic standards to
guide broadcasting practice," Miss
Richardson said.
The new radio code fulfills this
demand very well, in her opinion.
"There is no infringement on the
rights of free speech or censorship,
only a responsible restraint con

cerning the policy for the presenta
tion of public questions, standards
for children's programs, and the
like," Mrs. Richardson asserted.
