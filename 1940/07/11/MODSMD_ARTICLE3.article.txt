# McCarty Urges More Realism
## Suggest Authors Use Philosophy in Plays

"If you want to write plays, form
a philosophy of living and see ordi
nary things as they are—not as you
want them to be," declared E. Clay
ton McCarty yesterday afternoon in
Memorial Hall. A speaker at the
conference on Children and the The
ater, Mr. McCarty's address con
cerned "The Teaching of Creative
Writing to Children."
Mr. McCarty said that exact imi
tation of life does not make a play.
It is necessary to know the work
ing of the human mind and to see
what is under the exterior, he said.
"The student, to do this, must have
experience, and experience must go
back to natural things," he adds.
"Form also comes from the natural
—there is no rule for it but it must
be studied from life. The way the
student interprets life is also im
portant.
"To write, you must use the things
you understand—the people who are
next to you every day. This is what
makes a good play. The most im
portant task of the teacher is to
make the student think, but if the
teacher does not have a definite phi
losophy of life, she has nothing to
pass on to the students."
