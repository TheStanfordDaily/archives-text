# Flower Paintings Now on Exhibit
## 
### 
Paintings by Nell Walker Warner
and Will Foster, painters from
Southern California, are being shown
at Stanford University Art Gallery
until July 15.
The Warner paintings of flowers
are noted for their brilliant atmos
pheric qualities and "color theme"
arrangements. The paintings seem to
be a permanent natural flower ar
rangement because of the effect of
space and light created by the art
ist's technique.
A smaller collection of landscapes
in addition to the flower subjects
which contrast the flower paintings
in subject and manner of painting,
is also shown.
Mr. Foster's paintings demonstrate
his ability to express himself in the
medium he uses.
