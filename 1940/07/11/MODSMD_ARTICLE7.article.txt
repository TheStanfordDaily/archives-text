# 'Students Aren't Mischievous' Gordy, Campus Cop, Reveals
## 
### 
"Stanford students are really a
pretty nice bunch; in fact, they don't
give us much trouble at all," said
Gordon Davis, the dark, good-look
ing cop that cruises about the cam
pus in his fancy black and white car,
when asked about the police problem
at Stanford.
So far this quarter there have been
no accidents on campus, and very
few arrests. Last year $800 was col
lected from men students for traffic
violations.
Even though there are few cars and
students on the campus this sum
mer, Gordy still has plenty of work
to keep him busy. He is on duty
from 8 to 5 o'clock every day, and is
allowed only one day off a week,
and that can not be on the week
end.
And just because Gordy is off duty
at 5 o'clock, it doesn't mean that
crime can have its play. There is a
radio patrol car on constant duty.
The competent George Burns is on
duty from 4 o'clock to midnight and
William Hogan, watchman, is on
irom midnight to 8 o'clock.
ItEAI. OFFENDERS
This summer Gordy just can't sit

and listen to "Calling all cars." He
has to keep a sharp eye out for the
off-campus folk: those not connected
with the university. They're the real
offenders. They don't know much
about the Stanford campus and suc
ceed in violating most of the traffic
and parking regulations.
Gordy has a swell time routing
them from behind the Cubberly
Education Library. They seem to
think that they can park anywhere
they please; maybe they haven't
learned to read like Stanford men
and women.
Gordy also has another duty to
perform; he patrols the vicinities of
all the vacant houses on the campus,
including sororities and fraternities,
that have been listed with the de
partment. Prowlers are common,
and especially since the Beta, A.T.O.
robbery, the police have been all the
more on the lookout.
"Furthermore," Gordy said. "Stan
ford students aren't at all mischiev
ous. They are on the whole a pretty
well-behaved lot, even though they
like to throw water bags and such.
They don't do anything inherently
criminal."
