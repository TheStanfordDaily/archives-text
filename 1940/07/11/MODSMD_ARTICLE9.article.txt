# Film and Drama Scouts to View 'Congressman'
## Washington Satire To Run Next Weeek; Chance at Broadway 
### 
In the audience at the premiere
performance of "Mr. Congressman,"
Leon Pearson's satire on American
politics, will be representatives of
several of the major film companies
and an unnamed Broadway pro
ducer. If they judge Mr. Pearson's
work as able to stand the gaff of

public opinion, "Mr. Congressman"
will be produced on Broadway.
After opening on Monday evening
at 8:15, the play will run through
Saturday evening of next week. A
special invitational preview will be
shown Saturday only to members of
the Conference on Teacher Devel
opment.
NEW DRAMATIC POLICY
Directed by F. Cowles Strickland,
and presented by the Division of
Speech and Drama, "Mr. Congress
man," will attempt to inaugurate a
new policy in dramatics at Stanford
â€”that of producing plays by young
authors in an effort to bolster the
legitimate stage.
"Mr. Congressman,'' was written
by Leon Pearson especially for Mr.
Strickland, while he was on the
stage. In a completely rewritten and
up-to-date form, the play lampoons
the Democratic administration, and
behind-the-scenes life in Washing
ton.
From his experiences as a news
paper correspondent in Washington,
Leon Pearson gathered a mass of
facts, which mixed with invented
characters makes the plot for "Mr.
Congressman."
Sam Anders, the congressman,
faces the pex - ennial troubles of re
election. Aside from the usual de
rogatory remarks of his opposition,
he is troubled by blackmailers, brib
ery, and women. The jovial politic
ian, played by Professor Virgil Whit

aker, wades through the political
mire to beat the "purge."
His son Jimmy, played by H. B.
Lee, causes his father embarrass
ment by his financial dealings. Jim
my's friend, Andrew March, causes
Sam a political pain-in-the-neck be
cause he is the president's brain
truster de luxe. Andrew March
will be portrayed by Bob Burnett.
Anita, the woman who is the sena
tor's past, will be played by Patricia
Allen. Helen Green has designed the
original costume for Anita in a pre
view of next season's fashion, and
Waldemar Johansen has charge of
technical direction.
Tickets are on sale at the Dramat
ics office for 50 cents.
