### 
With more than 300 teachers,
P.T.A. representatives, education
students, and faculty members from
Stanford and other California col
leges and universities present, the
Conference on Teacher Development
came to a close Sunday morning.
Emphasizing the teacher as the
vital factor in the educational pro
gram, the four-day meeting included
addresses and panel discussions on
diverse phases of our educational
problems.
Dean Kefauver, of the Stanford
School of Education, announced the
plan of the conference at the first
meeting in Memorial Hall last
Thursday and introduced the key
note speaker, Dr. W. Earl Arm
strong, of the American Council on
Education, who presented his views
on "The Theory and Practice of
Teacher Education."
CULTURE NECESSARY
Dr. Armstrong emphasized the
teacher's need for a general cul
tural knowledge as well as profes
sional training, and urged the co
operation of school and community
in teacher education.
Concluding the opening session
was a panel discussion of the prob
lems of an anonymous teacher. The
problems were based upon actual
examinations, observations and re
ports on the "teacher."
Members of the panel were: Dr.
Norman Fenton, Stanford professor
of Education, chairman; Mrs. Nan
Allan, principal of Fresno Schools;
Dr. James Cutting of Agnew State
Hospital; Albert Davis, principal of
Salinas Union High School; Lowry
Howard, president of Menlo School
and Junior College; and Dr. Helen
Pry or, Stanford Women's Medical
Adviser.
VIEW ACTUAL CASES
Thursday evening the delegates
examined the question of pupil
teacher relationships. Actual cases
of problem children and their rela
tionships with teachers were pre
sented by graduate students in the
School of Education and pupils from
the Reading Center. The production
was staged in "living newspaper"
style, with Dr. Hubert C. Heffner
and George E. Murphy acting as
commentators.
