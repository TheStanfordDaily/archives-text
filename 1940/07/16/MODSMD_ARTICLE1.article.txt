## Armstrong Stresses Cultural Background In Teacher Training 
### 
With more than 300 teachers,
P.T.A. representatives, education
students, and faculty members from
Stanford and other California col
leges and universities present, the
Conference on Teacher Development
came to a close Sunday morning.
Emphasizing the teacher as the
vital factor in the educational pro
gram, the four-day meeting included
addresses and panel discussions on
diverse phases of our educational
problems.
Dean Kefauver, of the Stanford
School of Education, announced the
plan of the conference at the first
meeting in Memorial Hall last
Thursday and introduced the key
note speaker, Dr. W. Earl Arm
strong, of the American Council on
Education, who presented his views
on "The Theory and Practice of
Teacher Education."
CULTURE NECESSARY
Dr. Armstrong emphasized the
teacher's need for a general cul
tural knowledge as well as profes
sional training, and urged the co
operation of school and community
in teacher education.
Concluding the opening session
was a panel discussion of the prob
lems of an anonymous teacher. The
problems were based upon actual
examinations, observations and re
ports on the "teacher."
Members of the panel were: Dr.
Norman Fenton, Stanford professor
of Education, chairman; Mrs. Nan
Allan, principal of Fresno Schools;
Dr. James Cutting of Agnew State
Hospital; Albert Davis, principal of
Salinas Union High School; Lowry
Howard, president of Menlo School
and Junior College; and Dr. Helen
Pry or, Stanford Women's Medical
Adviser.
VIEW ACTUAL CASES
Thursday evening the delegates
examined the question of pupil
teacher relationships. Actual cases
of problem children and their rela
tionships with teachers were pre
sented by graduate students in the
School of Education and pupils from
the Reading Center. The production
was staged in "living newspaper"
style, with Dr. Hubert C. Heffner
and George E. Murphy acting as
commentators.
A mythical, though typical, Cali
fornia school district called "Osceola"
was described, examined, and ripped
to shreds by educational experts on
Friday afternoon.
A panel representing the different
types of workers who were appro
priately concerned with this problem
considered the report of a committee
which had made a special analysis of
the conditions in the "Osceola"
School District, and presented rec
ommendations for improvement.
EURICH LISTS QUALITIES
Seven qualifications of a good
educational worker were laid down
by Dr. Alvin C. Eurich, Stanford
professor of education.
Recent trends and research ex
perimentation in the field of child
development were explored by a
panel of experts headed by Dr. Reg
inald Bell, associate professor of
education, in a full day session
Saturday.
Extensive surveys made with
fornia children and the prospects for
large representative groups of Cali
future studies were described by
Harold E. Jones, of the institute of
Child Welfare at Berkeley.
TRENDS EXPLAINED
The implications which the trends
described in the morning session
hold for the school program of to
day were explained by Mrs. Lorraine
Sherer, director of curriculum of the
Los Angeles county schools, in the
Saturday afternoon meeting of the
panel.
Description of the part played by
a child's anatomical structure in his
later development and behavior was
given by Dr. Helen Pryor, professor
of hygiene and physical education
at Stanford.
Other child development experts
on the panel were: Leo Cain, acting
instructor in education and member
of the American Council on Educa
tion, Motion Picture Project; Dr. J.
Paul Leonard of the Stanford School
of Education; Mrs. Rollin Brown,
P.T.A. representative from Los An
geles; and Mrs. Frank M. Wright,
P.T.A. representative from El Monte.
BROWN LEADS SESSION
Dr. Walter H. Brown conducted
the second of the two Saturday ses
sions concerned with the discussion
of the factors that determine the
physical and mental health status of
teachers.
Dr. Helen Pryor asserted that
mental and physical health was nec
essary for teachers for both their
personal protection, and for the pro
tection of their pupils. She added
that check-ups should be made at
regular intervals.
Also in the afternoon meeting,
J. P. Nelson described the California
Physician's Service, which makes it
possible for teachers to insure their
health at a small price. He told how
these groups not only try to cure
the ill, but also give preventive and
diagnostic service.
Parent participation with school
authorities and persons responsible
for other welfare agencies in com
munity planning for improvement of
the general welfare was one of the
chief problems discussed.

Physician's Service, which makes it
possible for teachers to insure their
health at a small price. He told how
these groups not only try to cure
the ill, but also give preventive and
diagnostic service.
Parent participation with school
authorities and persons responsible
for other welfare agencies in com
munity planning for improvement of
the general welfare was one of the
chief problems discussed.
With more than 300 teachers,
P.T.A. representatives, education
students, and faculty members from
Stanford and other California col
leges and universities present, the
Conference on Teacher Development
came to a close Sunday morning.
Emphasizing the teacher as the
vital factor in the educational pro
gram, the four-day meeting included
addresses and panel discussions on
diverse phases of our educational
problems.
Dean Kefauver, of the Stanford
School of Education, announced the
plan of the conference at the first
meeting in Memorial Hall last
Thursday and introduced the key
note speaker, Dr. W. Earl Arm
strong, of the American Council on
Education, who presented his views
on "The Theory and Practice of
Teacher Education."
CULTURE NECESSARY
Dr. Armstrong emphasized the
teacher's need for a general cul
tural knowledge as well as profes
sional training, and urged the co
operation of school and community
in teacher education.
Concluding the opening session
was a panel discussion of the prob
lems of an anonymous teacher. The
problems were based upon actual
examinations, observations and re
ports on the "teacher."
Members of the panel were: Dr.
Norman Fenton, Stanford professor
of Education, chairman; Mrs. Nan
Allan, principal of Fresno Schools;
Dr. James Cutting of Agnew State
Hospital; Albert Davis, principal of
Salinas Union High School; Lowry
Howard, president of Menlo School
and Junior College; and Dr. Helen
Pry or, Stanford Women's Medical
Adviser.
VIEW ACTUAL CASES
Thursday evening the delegates
examined the question of pupil
teacher relationships. Actual cases
of problem children and their rela
tionships with teachers were pre
sented by graduate students in the
School of Education and pupils from
the Reading Center. The production
was staged in "living newspaper"
style, with Dr. Hubert C. Heffner
and George E. Murphy acting as
commentators.
A mythical, though typical, Cali
fornia school district called "Osceola"
was described, examined, and ripped
to shreds by educational experts on
Friday afternoon.
A panel representing the different
types of workers who were appro
priately concerned with this problem
considered the report of a committee
which had made a special analysis of
the conditions in the "Osceola"
School District, and presented rec
ommendations for improvement.
EURICH LISTS QUALITIES
Seven qualifications of a good
educational worker were laid down
by Dr. Alvin C. Eurich, Stanford

Recent trends and research ex
perimentation in the field of child
development were explored by a
panel of experts headed by Dr. Reg
inald Bell, associate professor of
education, in a full day session
Saturday.
Extensive surveys made with
fornia children and the prospects for
large representative groups of Cali
future studies were described by
Harold E. Jones, of the institute of
Child Welfare at Berkeley.
TRENDS EXPLAINED
The implications which the trends
described in the morning session
hold for the school program of to
day were explained by Mrs. Lorraine
Sherer, director of curriculum of the
Los Angeles county schools, in the
Saturday afternoon meeting of the
panel.
Description of the part played by
a child's anatomical structure in his
later development and behavior was
given by Dr. Helen Pryor, professor
of hygiene and physical education
at Stanford.
Other child development experts
on the panel were: Leo Cain, acting
instructor in education and member
of the American Council on Educa

sions concerned with the discussion
of the factors that determine the
physical and mental health status of
teachers.
Dr. Helen Pryor asserted that

personal protection, and for the pro
tection of their pupils. She added
that check-ups should be made at
regular intervals.

teachers.
Dr. Helen Pryor asserted that
mental and physical health was nec
essary for teachers for both their
personal protection, and for the pro
tection of their pupils. She added
that check-ups should be made at
regular intervals.
Also in the afternoon meeting,
J. P. Nelson described the California
Physician's Service, which makes it
possible for teachers to insure their
health at a small price. He told how
these groups not only try to cure
the ill, but also give preventive and
diagnostic service.
Parent participation with school
authorities and persons responsible
for other welfare agencies in com
munity planning for improvement of
the general welfare was one of the
chief problems discussed.
With more than 300 teachers,
P.T.A. representatives, education
students, and faculty members from
Stanford and other California col
leges and universities present, the
Conference on Teacher Development
came to a close Sunday morning.
Emphasizing the teacher as the
vital factor in the educational pro
gram, the four-day meeting included
addresses and panel discussions on
diverse phases of our educational
problems.
Dean Kefauver, of the Stanford
School of Education, announced the
plan of the conference at the first
meeting in Memorial Hall last
Thursday and introduced the key
note speaker, Dr. W. Earl Arm
strong, of the American Council on
Education, who presented his views
on "The Theory and Practice of
Teacher Education."
CULTURE NECESSARY
Dr. Armstrong emphasized the
teacher's need for a general cul
tural knowledge as well as profes
sional training, and urged the co
operation of school and community
in teacher education.
Concluding the opening session
was a panel discussion of the prob
lems of an anonymous teacher. The
problems were based upon actual
examinations, observations and re
ports on the "teacher."
Members of the panel were: Dr.
Norman Fenton, Stanford professor
of Education, chairman; Mrs. Nan
Allan, principal of Fresno Schools;
Dr. James Cutting of Agnew State
Hospital; Albert Davis, principal of
Salinas Union High School; Lowry
Howard, president of Menlo School
and Junior College; and Dr. Helen
Pry or, Stanford Women's Medical

School of Education and pupils from
the Reading Center. The production
