# Utilities Are Prepared to Meet War Demands, Conference Told
## Utah Expert Tells Business Men Government Control Unnecessary 
### 
"Elcctrical utilities are willing, anxious and capable of covering every
demand of the nation in this emergency," declared Adam S. Bennion of
the Utah Power and Light Company in his speech before the Stanford
Business Conference yesterday."
In answering a current rumor that the utilities are not prepared for a

'sudden increased demand, he cited
figures showing that the utilities' ca
pacity has increased 300 per cent,
the country's population 29 per cent,
and industry only 15 per cent in a
past period.
Except for a strip through the Da
kotas, the country is honey-combed
with power lines, and there is abso
lutely no need for the government
to take over public utilities, Mr.
Bennion said.
"The wheels are set to go; the na
tion need not be nervous," he as
serted.
OUTLOOK FOR UTILITIES
Referring to the Tennessee Valley
Authority Experiment, he declared:
"Politicians have built on some
thing that the utilities companies
have slipped on somewhere. Every
one makes mistakes. As for set
ting lower rates, the government can
give you anything for almost noth
ing, but that doesn't prove any
thing."
Referring to the outlook for pub
lic utilities, Mr. Bennion said that
the residential sections offer the
greatest promise.
"There are nine million homes not
wired and five million new houses
that will be built in the near future,"
he said. "Forty per cent of all cus
tomers use less than two dollars of
utilities per month, and 60 per cent
use less than three dollars."
"There is a market and there are
salesmen. I look forward to a time
when the average use of the resi
dential consumer will be increased
and the cost still further reduced."
