# Work Advances On Hoover Libe
## Concrete for Dome To Be Poured Soon 
### 
Pouring of concrete in the dome
this week will bring a step nearer
the completion of the new Hoover
Library building. The tower will
then be gunnited, which will mean
an additional four or five days. Steel
and sheet metal work is being com
pleted and the plumbing is now be
ing installed.
Scaffolding will not be torn down
until the plastering is finished and
the date for that is, as yet, indefinite.
The carillon has been planned on
since the building's inception, for
the plans show it to be placed on
the fourteenth floor, with the key
board located on the thirteenth.
Elevator shafts are being installed
now and the interior, as a whole, is
starting to take form. The 274-foot
tower will face the Memorial Hall
upon completion toward the end of
the year. The $600,000 building
will house the largest collection of
war-time documents gathered since
1914 from secret files of the Allied
and Central Powers.
Five million documents large, the
collection i ncludes photographs,
maps, and film as well as books and
papers. What is now the Hoover
Library in a wing of the Stanford
Library will occupy the main floor
of the new building. The other 16
floors will be used as stacks for other
collections on war, revolution, and
peace.
NIAGARA FALLS, Ont. â€” Most
college graduates may be sitting
around wondering what happens
now, but for the eight boys who re
ceived diplomas here this week from
the Niagara Parks Commission
Training School for Apprentice
Gardeners the job-hunting problem
does not exist. All of them were
hired before they could get off the
platform.
