# Peace Chosen As Radio Topic
## 
### 
If peace is to be reorganized it
must be on a regional basis, Dr.
Charles E. Martin, acting professor
of political science at Stanford Uni
versity, asserted today in advance of
a radio talk to be broadcast from
Station KPO Wednesday evening at
9:30 o'clock. His subject is "Peace
in the Americas."
Our ample peace machinery broke
down, Professor Martin says, be
cause it was too centralized. His
plan is to organize for peace among
those countries in the same region
whose problems are capable of solu
tion.
Dr. Martin, the author of numer
ous books on international law and
relations, is head of the political sci
ence department at the University
of Washington.
