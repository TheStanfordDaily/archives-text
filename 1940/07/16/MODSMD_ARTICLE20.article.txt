# Golfers Enter Semifinals
## Pieper Downs French, Glashan in Tourney 
### 
Medalist Ernie Pieper, Jr., slam
med his way into the quarter-finals
of the Stanford Invitational Tourna
ment Sunday by downing Bob Glash
an 2-up in the first round of the
match play and then pushed Jimmy
French to the sidetrack in a long
driving and putting duel.
The former California state cham
pion drove his way to the top by
defeating French, the former San
Francisco city golf king, on the 17th
hole. Warren Berl, the '38 and '39
title-holder, did not enter the tour
ney, thereby leaving his crown un
defended. Berl reached the semi
finals of the Western Amateur Tour
nament in Minneapolis this past
week.
The only near upset came in the
first round when Walt Williams, the
San Jose prep grid mentor, bowed
to Jack Lovegren, 2 and 1. Williams
came in second in the qualifying
round with an even par 72.
The best card of the day was that
of Bud Finger a four-under-par
69. For his second round, Bud came
through 2-up on O. H. Davidson.
Tournament Chairman John Kohler
needed 19 holes to dispose of young
Bobby Roos in the second round.
Stanford's own Bones Hamilton of
"vow boy" fame went down in de
feat, 4-3, before Buddy Fox. Alf
Branden, the big Stanford center of
Rose Bowl reputation, was another
"quickie" victim, losing 1-up to Art
Breene in the first flight.
Ex-track Mentor Dink Templeton
and another Stanford athlete, Abe
Hables, one of Dink's pupils and a
fine sprinter, showed up well in both
their matches. Dink hung up a 5-
and-4 defeat on R. Gracia and Abe
humbled J. Beard 2-up.
Since 1925, the average retail price
of automobiles has been reduced 24
per cent.
