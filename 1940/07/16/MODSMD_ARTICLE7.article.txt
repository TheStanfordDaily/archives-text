# Child Theater Meeting Ends
## Specialists Discuss Problems of Play 
### 
Climaxed by a summary round
table discussion on the problems of
play production and management,
the conference on children and the
theater which was held in Palo Alto
was concluded Thursday afternoon.
The discussion was conducted by
Mrs. Hazel G. Robertson, director of
Palo Alto Children's Theater.
This conference was the first to be
held since the drama association
disbanded, and was very successful,
according to Mrs. Robertson, who
feels that a start has been made
toward a new alliance of those teach
ing in the field of drama. To further
this union, another conference will
be held next year, probably during
spring quarter.
Specialists in the field of teaching
and theater production spoke before
the 35 teachers registered in the con
ference. A series of plays for various
levels was presented and an exhibit
of sets and costumes for well known
children's plays were on display as
well as a collection of children's
leisure-time books.
A demonstration of story and folk
dancing was held and the teachers
were able to observe actual re
hearsals as part of the conference.
