# Lutz Predicts Russ-Axis War
## Outlines Policy For U.S. at Conference 
### 
The German-Italian axis, which
now dominates Europe, may even
tually attack the Russian bear, Pro
fessor Ralph H. Lutz, dean of grad
uate study and chairman of the Hoo
ver Library, predicted last night be
fore the fourth annual business con
ference held at Stanford.
"With the subjugation of Great
Britain, Germany will utilize her
political domination of the Conti
nent to extend her economic lead
ership throughout the world," Pro
fessor Lutz asserted.
Complete destruction of the Brit
ish fleet would follow as a conse
quence of England's collapse, and
the United States and Japan alone
would remain to dominate the seas
he said.
Three alternatives will face the
United States if England loses the
war, according to Professor Lutz. If
the United States fails to negotiate
trade agreements with Germany, she
will engage in either a trade war or
an actual conflct with the Continental
power, he said.
