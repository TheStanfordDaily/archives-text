# Business Leaders Discuss U.S. and War at Conference
## Skilled Labor Shortage in Aircraft Industries, Lockheed Official Says 
### 
In their analysis of American business conditions, all speakers at the
Business Conference this week have considered the war and its effect on
the United States.
R. Randall Irwin of the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation yesterday de
clared that despite the assurances of President Roosevelt, Paul V. McNutt,

'and other political leaders that there
is no American shortage of skilled

may step in and force their pur

"The Future of the American
Merchant Marine" was discussed by
Roger D. Lapham on Tuesday. Mr.
Lapham explained the two divisions
in American shipping — domestic
trade, in which American shipown
