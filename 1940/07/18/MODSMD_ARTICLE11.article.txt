# Business Leaders Discuss U.S. and War at Conference
## Skilled Labor Shortage in Aircraft Industries, Lockheed Official Says 
### 
In their analysis of American business conditions, all speakers at the
Business Conference this week have considered the war and its effect on
the United States.
R. Randall Irwin of the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation yesterday de
clared that despite the assurances of President Roosevelt, Paul V. McNutt,

'and other political leaders that there
is no American shortage of skilled
labor, California aircraft manufac
turers are having increased and con
tinued difficulty in finding enough
experienced mechanics to fill de
fense orders.
Speaking before a Wednesday
afternoon session of the Stanford
Business Conference on "Problems
of Hiring under Rapidly Expanding
Production," Mr. Irwin outlined the
extensive program of training
schools, and careful selection with
which Lockheed has found labor for
its expanding plants in the last two
years.
GOVERNMENT AIDS LABOR
State and federal employment
services have proved the best outside
sources supplying skilled labor, ac
cording to Mr. Irwin, but even these
have not been able to meet the de
mand. Labor difficulties in the air
craft industry were attributed by
the speaker to the rapid growth
since ,1937 which has given no time
for aircraft plants to train men of
the "foreman" category.
Offering the prediction that de
fense preparedness will bring a rea
sonable boom. Professor J. Franklin
Ebersole of Harvard University, yes
terday tempered this forecast by de
claring that no roaring price raise
will accompany the boom.
"You must remember," he said,
"that there will be regimentation
and the government will not allow
the money market to get out of
hand."
BUY LONG-TERM BONDS
"Go ahead and buy low-yield,
long-term bonds," Professor Eber
sole advised, because they are likely
to be the best investment you will
have for a long time, and there is
also the possibility the government
may step in and force their pur
chase.
"The Future of the American
Merchant Marine" was discussed by
Roger D. Lapham on Tuesday. Mr.
Lapham explained the two divisions
in American shipping — domestic
trade, in which American shipown
ers send ships from one American
port to another, and foreign trade.
"No new ships have been bought
by the Merchant Marine in recent
years," said Mr. Lapham, "because
the cost of operation and competi
tion with the railroads in intercoastal
trade makes it impossible for the
companies to invest in new ships."
No old ships can be sold without
the permisison of the American
Maritime Commission, he pointed
out.
Mr. Lapham considered the possi
bility of a Hitler-dominated Eu
rope with South America under his
economic domination and Japan as
the most important power in the Far
East.
"If that situation comes to pass,"
he said, "the United States will un
doubtedly conduct foreign trade on
the barter system and the goods
will be carried in German vessels.
The American standard of living
will be lowered to meet foreign
conditions."
GRAVE MONEY PROBLEM
William L. Montgomery, associated
with the San Francisco Chamber of
Commerce, on Tuesday emphasized
the Latin American countries' money
problem. They are unable to pay the
United States goods because of the
vast ratio differences, he said.
The United States can help the
Latin American states by loaning
money to them or by investing money
in mining concessions, he suggested.
Mr. Montgomery warned the po
tential investor against putting too
much money in Mexico, Chile, Bo
livia, and Cuba because his money

cannot be withdrawn in these states
as readily as in other countries.
SACRAFICES DEMANDED
Asserting that great individual
sacrifice inevitably would have to
be made, J. Douglas Brown of
Princeton University, told the con
ference Tuesday afternoon that ap
praisal of the gravity of the current
world political situation is impos
sible.
"The United States will find itself
face to face with the greatest prob
lems since the Civil War during the
next few years—and I speak as one
who saw action in and was well
aware of the gravity of the last
war," Dr. Brown asserted.
Referring to the present rearma
ment program, the speaker declared:
"We will either have to arm at a
tremendous rate or live in fear—and
no one in a democracy wants to
exist under the latter condition."
Dealing with the problem of labor
supply in our defense industries,
Dr. Brown said curtailment of the
labor supply during the depression
has resulted in a lack of both skilled
labor and supervisory ability in such
key defense industries as airplane
construction and tool-making.
