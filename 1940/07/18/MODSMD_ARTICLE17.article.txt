# Quasi-War Basis In U.S.â€”Dowrie
## 
### 
The United States has been placed
on a quasi-war basis, Dr. George W.
Dowrie declared in a Tuesday Eve
ning Series lecture on "The Effect of
the War on American Business."
"Since 1933 politics have overshad
owed business, but today politics is
being eclipsed by the war," the pro
fessor of finance declared. "Both
candidates for the presidency will be
swerved from week to week by
events across the sea."
The Stanford professor of finance
asserted that business conditions are
going to be better in 1940 than in
1939. It is going to be rather diffi
cult, however, to differentiate be
tween the natural and artificial as
pects of the business recovery which
we are enjoying, he said.
Preparedness and aid short of
war to Britain, class co-operation,
and a realistic and calm attitude, no
matter what turn events take, were
advocated by Dr. Dowrie.
