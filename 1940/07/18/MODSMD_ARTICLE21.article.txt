Big scores on acocunt of a first
class gale caused a series of upsets
that amazed the Happy Worrier
Harry Shipkey Tuesday. First be
fore a discussion of the little swat
sessions, the manager of the New
Dealers wishes that three players of
any ol' position would play with this
sterling aggregation. Please report
on Field 3 at 5 o'clock today.
Starting the seance with the usual
blistering seven innings of ball, the
Accordions fought hard and long to
win over the Foreign Legion,
which as per schedule didn't show
up. (Score 1 to 0). Has anyone seen
or heard anything of this bunch; it
worries everyone in the league as to
where they are:
The players of Greer's Greasers
surprised themselves and their op
ponents by walloping out 8 runs to
the Socialists' lonely 1. The upset
stunned the Greasers to such an ex
tent that they have been unable to
comment on their victory. The win
puts them back in the running for
the title of Head Cripples of the
Wheel Chair League.
The Red Gappers slugged out a 17
to 2 win over the New Dealers with
an amazing show of power in the
batting side of the play. Ball hand
ling for the New Dealers was very
sad and batting was a couple of de
grees in the same direction. Trouble
was encountered when the New
Dealers found themselves lacking
players, but they tried.
The Slavedrivers continued their
spurt toward the top with another
win, this time over the Toro Bulls
for the count of 19 to 7. The Red
Gappers were on their stride and
nothing could have downed them
after they got rolling. A little wind
and muscle of the batters made a
powerful combination.
The Sparducks, the leaders of the
league, dropped their first game to
the Agonists, 16 to 3. The footballers
pounded out the total in no time
and made the Sparducks look silly.
The win for the Agonists moves them

up into a tie for first with their
opponents.
The Prune Pickers showed a fancy
brand of ball when they slammed
out a 13 to 9 tally over the Outlaws.
This helps them on up the scale into
another tie with four other teams
far a third place.
