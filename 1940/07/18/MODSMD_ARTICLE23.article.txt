# 'Peace Through Regional Pacts'
## Dr. Martin Declares Centralization Failed 
### 
Peace in the Amex'icas must be
attained through regionalism, Pro
fessor Charles E. Martin of the po
litical science department, asserted
last night in a radio talk from sta
tion KPO.
The policy must be a delibei-ate
one of keeping out of European wars
by maintaining neutral rights
through collective arrangements,
and, if need be, by collective effort,
he declared. Regionalism is the
means; neutrality and peace are the
ends ol this collective effort, he as
serted.
LEAGUE TOO CENTRALIZED
Dr. Martin attributed the failure
of the League of Nations to its aim
of compelling universality. The
League, he believes, has imposed too
great an obligation on each member
state—today nations are too inter
ested in military liability beyond
their own zones of responsibility.
Dr. Martin believes that existing
organization and effort must be
decentralized and that we must seek
regional oi'ganizations consisting of
only the countries directly interested
in the region concerned.
