# America's Past Colors Its Music
## 
### 
To be immortal, American music
must employ American material and
American methods, concluded George
Antheil in his talk, "The American
Composer's Debt to the Past," yes
terday afternoon.
Mr. Antheil, composer in resi
dence, said the comopsers of the im
mediate past used American mate
rial, but copied their methods and
techniques from the European mas
ters. This combination, he said, did
not produce good music.
In concluding his discussion Mr.
Antheil played two of his own com
positions written upon the same
Creole theme at the age of 17 and
27. The second showed the effects
of his intensive studies in American
musical literature.
