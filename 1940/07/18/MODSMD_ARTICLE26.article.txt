# Dr. Mackay Says Religion Essential
## 
### 
The insoluble bond existing be
tween religion and human well be
ing was emphasized by Di\ John A.
Mackay, president of the Princeton
Theological Seminary, in a sermon
at Memorial Church Sunday.
"The practice of goodness in
democracy is bound up with rev
erence for God," he declared. "As
the pursuit of truth and the practice
of goodness have been in some way
related to Christianity in the west
ern world, pursuit of truth and prac
tce of goodness in the western world
will die.
"In this strange and awful time
the future of civilization and culture
is with those who are willing to
gamble their lives on the way of
Jesus to knowledge of God and of
our fellow beings."
