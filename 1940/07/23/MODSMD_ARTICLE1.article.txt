# Davis Predicts Belt-tightening For Europeans
## Europe Will Hunger But May Not Starveâ€” Stanford Food Expert 
### 
A severe shortage of food will pre
vail throughout most of Europe next
winter, but at this early date no
one can definitely predict there will
be famine, Dr. Joseph S. Davis, di
rector of the Stanford Food Re
search Institute, said yesterday.
'"There is a great deal of margin
for tightening belts before famine
conditions prevail," Dr. Davis said,
pointing out that nations can do a
great deal of substituting of one kind
of food for another when they must.
He said that much will depend on
Germany's conduct of the war in the
near future. If Hitler decides to press
the fighting at all costs, he might
well consume all available food
stuffs, but if he decides upon a less
stringent policy, it is in his power to
afford enough food for the subsist
ence of his conquered nations
through the coming winter, Dr. Davis
believes.
FOOD SHORTAGE EVERYWHERE
Notwithstanding, there will be a
shortage everywhere, with the pos
sible exception of Germany, which
will naturally care primarily for it
self and its soldiers. Just how great
this shortage will be, even the Food
Research economists are unable to
say.
Accustomed to predict to within a
5 per cent margin how many bush
els of wheat, for instance, various
countries will produce, the Stanford
experts are at present without data
lor such determinations.
Certainly, the blockades which the
antagonists are enforcing upon each
other will contribute to the lack of
foodstuffs la f er in the year. If Brit
ain's blockade is as successful as it
has been, the continent will starve
for the fats and oils which the trop
ics, the Americas, and the Antarctic
seas ordinarily provide.
WINTER AND BLOCKADE
It is known that the severe winter
has resulted in crop prospects which
are generally bad, while France and
other war-ravaged countries lost
much in potential foodstuffs in the
destruction of fields, villages, horse
power, and manpower. France, of
course, will also lose the vitally im
portant exports from its colonies,
due to the English blockade.
The Danube basin, normally an
exporter of wheat, will have little to
export, and Hungary itself may even
have a shortage.

WINTER AND BLOCKADE
It is known that the severe winter
has resulted in crop prospects which
are generally bad, while France and
other war-ravaged countries lost
much in potential foodstuffs in the
destruction of fields, villages, horse
power, and manpower. France, of
course, will also lose the vitally im
portant exports from its colonies,
due to the English blockade.
The Danube basin, normally an
exporter of wheat, will have little to
export, and Hungary itself may even
have a shortage.
A severe shortage of food will pre
vail throughout most of Europe next
winter, but at this early date no
one can definitely predict there will
be famine, Dr. Joseph S. Davis, di
rector of the Stanford Food Re
search Institute, said yesterday.
'"There is a great deal of margin
for tightening belts before famine
conditions prevail," Dr. Davis said,
pointing out that nations can do a
great deal of substituting of one kind
of food for another when they must.
He said that much will depend on
Germany's conduct of the war in the
near future. If Hitler decides to press
the fighting at all costs, he might
well consume all available food
stuffs, but if he decides upon a less
stringent policy, it is in his power to
afford enough food for the subsist
ence of his conquered nations
through the coming winter, Dr. Davis
believes.
FOOD SHORTAGE EVERYWHERE
Notwithstanding, there will be a
shortage everywhere, with the pos
sible exception of Germany, which
will naturally care primarily for it
self and its soldiers. Just how great
this shortage will be, even the Food
Research economists are unable to
say.
Accustomed to predict to within a
5 per cent margin how many bush
els of wheat, for instance, various
countries will produce, the Stanford
experts are at present without data
lor such determinations.
Certainly, the blockades which the
antagonists are enforcing upon each
other will contribute to the lack of
foodstuffs la f er in the year. If Brit
ain's blockade is as successful as it
has been, the continent will starve
for the fats and oils which the trop
ics, the Americas, and the Antarctic
seas ordinarily provide.
