The Prune Pickers came out of the
orchard last Thursday long enough
to hang a 6 to 5 upset on the high
stepping Slavedrivers and knock
them out of their first place tie with
he Agonists and the Sparducks.
Somewhere among the trees the
Pickers found a smooth-working
pitcher named Bob Williams who
had a little trouble setting the fac
ulty men down as fast as they came
up. League Head Harry Shipkey,
from his unbiased position as first
baseman for the defeated Slavedriv
ers, vouchsafes the information that
several of his stellar players, name
ly, Dean John Bun, Husky Hunt,
and Jim Lawson, did not play.
"Mind you," says Shipkey, "I am
not alibiing the loss, I am simply
stating the cold fact that we were
not very hot. Furthermore, we'd
have romped home except for a
couple of very costly errors at cru
cial moments which never would
have occurred if I hadn't lost my
glasses"
AGONISTS ROLL ON
The Agonists maintained their
heavy-hitting, high-scoring pace by
running up a 12 to 5 score against
the New Dealers, and remained tied
for the lead with the Sparducks,
who rallied from their lone setback
at the hands of the selfsame Agon
ists earlier in the week to down
the Outlaws 12 to 3.
The Accordions, numbering sev
eral players from the distaff side of
their roster, continued their steady
rise up the standing by beating the
Socialists 5 to 2.
Greer's Greasers had a field day at
the expense of the hapless Toro
Bulls, swamping them 13 to 1. Clos
est game of the afternoon saw the
Foreign Legion shadow-box its way
through a ghostly seven-inning for
feiture to the Red Gappers, 1 to 0.
Tires up to four feet in cross sec
tion, and more than ten feet high
can now be made by using a new
mold weighing 300.000 pounds.
