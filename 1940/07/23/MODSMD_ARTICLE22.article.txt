Injured in an automobile accident
last Wednesday, Dr. Caroline Zach
ry of New York, director of the In
stitute for Personality of the Pro
gressive Education Association, is
now recovering at the Palo Alto

will be able to leave the hospital in
a few days- She has been here in
connection with the Social Educa
tion Investigation group.

The 70-odd Social Education In
vestigation workers will wind up
their official business this week and,
although a few may remain for fur
ther study independently, most of
them will call it a day, till next
summer. They come from various
schools from Seattle to Southern
California.

American Federation of Teachers
will have a series of teas, beginning
next Tuesday, but not, as was er
roneously reported in this depart
ment last week, in the Education
Building. Place and further particu
lars will be announced soon, said
Leif Thorne-Thomson, who is in
charge.

Wheel Chair League Editorialettcs.
—1. About Team Loyalty: Men, don't
miss being there to play every game,
unless you have to; 'taint fair to you,
the team, the league, or your ex
panding waist line.
2. About Aims and Objectives:
What if you do lose? It's only a
game, isn't it?
3. About Competition versus Rec
reation: You know the answer to
this one as well as we do. It's only
a game, isn't it?
4. About Injuries: Most of them
happen on the base paths. Folks,
this is serious; no bad injuries yet
this season and we don't want any;
but some collisions have looked a bit
too hard- It's only a game, isn't it?
5. About Women Softballers: Ku
dos to Accordions. Last season this
here wonderful department of The
Stanford Daily thought the game
would be as good for women as for
men. And still does. Either a sepa
rate league or mixed teams —or, by
heck, both. And so, Accordions, ku
dos to y' all. What's good for the
gander is good for the—but no, we
won't call the ladies a goose.

Santa Barbara educators, who
have been conducting a research
here this summer in educational
problems in their school system, will
finish their work this week.

Softballers who saw early this
summer the motion pictures of last
year's games will have the privilege
of seeing themselves in action at the
end of the season. For Czar Mogul
Harry Shipkey said that soon the
camera men will be out there again.
So, men, polish up those old wheel
chairs and get them into graceful,
virile action.
