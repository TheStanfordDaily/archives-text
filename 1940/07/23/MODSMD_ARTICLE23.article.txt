# Dr. Wilbur Says U.S. Democracy Needs Experts
## Jackson Emphasizes Business Leadership In Conference Talk 
### 
President Ray Lyman Wilbur,
speaking at the final dinner meeting
Thursday of the fourth annual Busi
ness Conference stressed the need
for finding and placing experts in
our government.
"The biggest problem facing the
United States today is to recognize
the true expert and follow him,
rather than listen to anyone who
can get the most hands raised on his
side," he said.
Democracy can be carried too far,
President Wilbur said, if it is simply
a matter of counting noses to decide
complex economic problems.
ANALOGY OF QUAILS
In speaking of leadership, he
drew an analogy between society
and the flocks of quail which run on
the Stanford campus, describing the
use of a leader to protect them
against enemies
"lf we could get as loyal and ef
fective leaders as the quails," he as
serted, "we would have a great
civilization. Quail leaders don't sell
out to the hawks."
Successful government, he con
cluded, is the harmonization of the
will of the majority with social
safety. The majority must discover
whom to follow before they delegate
their power to him.
DEAN JACKSON SPEAKS
Dean Jackson, at the Friday lunch
eon, declared that business leader

ship, like all other types of leader
ship, determines the nature and
quality of the organization. Busi
ness leaders, he declared, may differ
in their personalities in a dozen dif
ferent ways, but they must have
some spark in common. This, he
added, is a definite objective.
"Leadership," said Dean Jackson,
"is the art of influencing people to
co-operate toward some desirable
goal. It is not the process of ex
ploiting others, but of helping them

President Ray Lyman Wilbur,
speaking at the final dinner meeting
Thursday of the fourth annual Busi
ness Conference stressed the need
for finding and placing experts in
our government.
"The biggest problem facing the
United States today is to recognize
the true expert and follow him,
rather than listen to anyone who
can get the most hands raised on his
side," he said.
Democracy can be carried too far,
President Wilbur said, if it is simply
a matter of counting noses to decide
complex economic problems.
ANALOGY OF QUAILS
In speaking of leadership, he
drew an analogy between society
and the flocks of quail which run on
the Stanford campus, describing the
use of a leader to protect them
against enemies
"lf we could get as loyal and ef
fective leaders as the quails," he as
serted, "we would have a great
civilization. Quail leaders don't sell
out to the hawks."
Successful government, he con
cluded, is the harmonization of the
will of the majority with social
safety. The majority must discover
whom to follow before they delegate
their power to him.
