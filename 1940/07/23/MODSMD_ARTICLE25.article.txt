# Minister Depicts Dilemma of Man
## 
### 
Love, justice, and righteousness
are the foundations of life and will
not be destroyed, Dr. Clarence A.
Spaulding declared in his sermon,
"The Dilemma of the Good Man,"
last Sunday morning-
Dr. Spaulding, former Rhodes
scholar and pastor of the First Pres
byterian Church, River Forrest, 111.,
said a philosophy of skepticism is re
sponsible for the mistrust in religion
and democracy. He advocated that
the world examine its institutions
and then remedy them rather than
give them up altogether.
Two paths are open for men to
follow in these turbulent times, he
said—to escape, ilke the Monasticists
in the Middle Ages, or to face situa
tions.
Dr. Spaulding told how uncivilized
blacks in Africa resorted to suicide
when they saw their land slowly
turning to desert. Conservation and
irrigation were instituted and the
land was saved.
Man's dilemma today is essen
tially the same, he said. Man feels
that the world is hostile, and he sur
renders when he should work to
conserve his institutions.
