# Social Studies Workshop Ends
## Western Teachers Aid in $55,000 Test 
### 
Tomorrow marks the close of the
second summer session of the Stan
ford Teachers' Workshop held under
the auspices of the Social Studies
Investigation.
The Social Studies Investigation
was financed by a three-year grant
from the General Education Board
of $55,000. As a part of the program,
research projects in the fields of
school relationships, student inter
ests, and evaluation of the different
plans of organization of social edu
cation programs are being carried
on.
Many changes have resulted in
school curriculum as a result of the
intensive four weeks course. After
use in schools, the different pro
grams are then evaluated to deter
mine the effects of the change in
terms of the development of the
student.
AMERICAN CULTURE
Stress is placed upon an under
standing of American culture, and
allegiance to democratic values. Ef
fects of new approaches in the basic
social sciences are studies as leading
to more critical thinking.
Under the direction of Professor
Daniel Mendelowitz, an exhibit
demonstrating the relation of arts to
the study of government has been
prepared. The collection is on dis
play at 550 Salvatierra Street.
The purpose of the Workshop
method is in-service development
of teachers, and a contribution
toward a local program of curricu
lum development, said Professor
I. J. Quillen, codirector of the in
vestigation.
A selected group of teachers from
California, Utah, Washington, and
Colorado gather each summer at
Stanford to study the latest meth
ods of teaching the social sciences.
By working with the teacher in con
sultations, a model core curriculum
is formulated which the teacher
takes home and tries on his students.
