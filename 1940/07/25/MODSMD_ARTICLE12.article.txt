# 60 Pilots Pass Month's Training
## 
### 
Stanford's 60 student pilots this
week complete their first month of
flying instruction under the aus
pices of the Civil Aeronautics Asso
ciation.
Not a single student has yet fallen
by the wayside in the rigorous and
exacting schedule of ground school

and flying maneuvers which will
find the majority of the novice pilots
soloing within the next fortnight.
The advance course in aerobatics
has been transferred to Oakland,
where the seven best of the last class
of 70 Stanford flyers will be given
additional instruction in aerobatics
and cross-country piloting.
The pilots taking advance train
ing are: John Driscoll, Harry Mitch
ell. James McCloud, Roy Adamson,
Kay McMurray, William Ballhaus,
and John O'Brien.
