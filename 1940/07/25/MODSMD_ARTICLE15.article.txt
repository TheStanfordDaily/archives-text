## Dr. Jones on Radio Cites Fear Control 
### 
Fear of water, window shades, au
tomobile horns, white uniforms, and
railroad tracks are developed in
children through association, Dr.
Harold E. Jones declared last night
in a radio talk on "Children's
Fears" over Station KPO.
Dr. Jones, director of the Institute
of Child Welfare at the University of
California and acting professor of
psychology at Stanford this summer,
said that concealing the external
symptoms of fear intensifies the ac
tual amount of emotional disturb
ance.
"The control and elimination of
fear must rest not merely upon gen
eral rules and principles, but on a
careful study of the individual
problem and case," he said.
To illustrate, Dr. Jones cited the
case of a boy who was attacked by a
dog in a dark narrow alley. In later

life this individual feared all nar
row closed-in places, although he
had forgotten the original cause of
his fear.
A clinical study revealed the
source of the phobia, and the pa
tient in recollecting and under
standing the original experience, was
helped to control and reduce his fear
and to understand it.
Laughing at a child's fears only
makes him more ashamed to talk
about them, Dr. Jones explained. In
stead of having a confident attitude
toward life, the child develops a
sense of guilt, inadequacy and fear
fulnessâ€”traits which become serious
handicaps in making normal social
adjustments.
Jealousy, Dr. Jones found, was a
frequent cause of fear. In seven
hundred cases of children's lies, it
was found that two-thirds of these
were due primarily to some form
of fear.
The University of Illinois, which
in 1936 built the third atom-smash
ing cyclotron in the United States,
is to have one of the most efficient
machines of this kind yet construct
ed. Work began last week.
