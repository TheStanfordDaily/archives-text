A 12-inning thriller between the
Sparducks and the Slavedrivers was
the feature of the Wheel Chair
League Tuesday. The Sparducks
played their usual heads-up ball
and finally came through to win
after the score was tied up three
times, 2 to 2, 3 to 3, and 4 to 4.
According to Happy Worrier Harry
Shipkey, "It was a real workout!"
The game kept going on and on and
the weary little Slavedrivers picked
up their whips and stuff and went
home at 6:30 o'clock after being de
feated 4 to 5. John Hobson, another
of the Slavedrivers, said, "It was a
mere endurance contest and the fine
young men of the Sparducks finally
came out on top."
The usual battle of wits and
muscle took place on Field 1 when
the Foreign Legion met the Agonists
in a tilt ending up with the count
of 1 to 0. The game was called on
account of rain and no Foreign
Legion.
The pride and joy of Stoky's
blessed little heart, the Toro Bulls
took it on the chin in a hard-fought
game with the Socialists with the
score ending up 2 to 1. The Bulls
tried very hard but were handicap
ped by a few tough breaks and a
lack of oomph.
PATTERSON SHINES
The mighty pitching of Davy Pat
terson and a few scattered home
runs on the part of Henske and
Cleary drove the Greasers to a win
over the Prunepickers. Having a fine
combination of ball players and the
determination to play and play hard,
the Greasers have shown up admir
ably in the last few games. Their
winning streak has boosted them up
a couple of notches on the scale.
DEMOCRATS DOWNED
â€¢ The New Dealers again hampered
by the lack of players and lack of
ball playing went down the line for
the tally of 8 to 16 at the hands of
the Outlaws. This is the second
game that the Outlaws have won,
their first when they downed the
Accordions. They are a cinch to take
another one against the Legion of
Missing Men.
Inability to find a book with a
score or somebody to let. us know
what went on in the game between
the Red Gappers and the Accor
dions, we will leave out the score
for this time but can assure you that
it will head the story in the next
issue under the heading of "Unfin
ished Business."
