Approximately a dozen candidates"
for the doctorate in Education are
winding up their written examina
tions this week, after a 10-day
grind.

Crowding a quarter's work into
eight weeks, education students are
displaying a growing seriousness
and concern over reading assign
ments and term papers, as the sec
ond half of the session is well started.
Library sessions are longer than
ever, bull sessions shorter, type
writers punished harder. "Is busy.
Is much work. Is hot. Is good-bye
too soon."

Students and faculty look forward
to a time of rest at the close of the
session. But there is one important
group of workers to whom the time
intervening between quarters is a
time for just so much more work.
These workers are the care-takers,
who have to put the buildings in
repair while they are not being used.
And as one of these men expressed
it, a building is no sooner con
structed than it begins to wear out;
and the older it is the more work
is required to care for it. Even after
only a scarce two years, the ravages
of time, in the Education Building,

>the care-takers and janitors. "Sic

Entering the last week of their
work, members of the Teacher De
velopment Workshop are exchang
ing visits with those at Mills Col
lege in Oakland. The Stanford
group is there today and Mills Col
lege Workshoppers will come here
Tuesday, when they will discuss "In
Service Training for Teachers" and
"Development of a Specific Source
Unit" under leadership of Profes
sor J. Paul Leonard and hear a din
ner address by Dr. Ralph H. Lutz
on "The World Crisis in Educa
tion."

Children of the Demonstration
School go right out into the big
world and see things for themselves
—which after all is "right smart"
educational. Miss Evans' group vis
ited a nursery in Mayfield Friday,
and the junior high core curriculum
group inspected a house recently
featured in pictures in Life maga
izne.

Just off the press is a brand new
book by Dr. J. Paul Leonard, asso
ciate professor of education. It is the
fourth volume of his series entitled,
"Making Sense."
