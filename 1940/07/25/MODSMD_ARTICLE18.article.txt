# Antheil Lauds Modern Music
## Composer Illustrates Nationalistic Trends 
### 
American music is in no sense re
treating to the "masters," but is defi
nitely moving forward to finer na
tional musical expression, George
Antheil, composer-in-residence and
lecturer in music, declared yester
day in his lecture on "American
Music Today" in the Education Au
ditorium.
Modern trends were illustrated by
recordings and piano selections by
Mr. Antheil. The lecture was the
third in a series of four talks on
American music to be presented
during summer quarter.
Listing characteristic trends of
modern American musicians, he in
cluded: the better adaptation of
words to music; a broader, more
pronounced melody; a simplifying
tendency; and a repudiation of for
eign techniques.
Compositions by Roy Harris and
Aaron Copland, as well as several
of Mr. Antheil's own works, were
used to illustrate these tendencies.
Popular song-writers were praised
by the lecturer for their courage in
leaving traditional word-use in songs
and adopting forms of lyrics under
standable to "the man in the street."
Mr. Antheil anticipates a contin
uous flow of musicians and compos
ers from war-torn Europe, and be
lieves it may have an unfortunate
effect on developing native-born
musicians.
King Christian of Denmark is the
world's tallest monarch. His height
