# Wigs Top Gay Costumes For Goldsmith Comedy
## 
### 
Twenty inches high, and of stiff,
white horsehair braid is the wig Dr.
Margery Bailey will wear in "She
Stoops to Conquer," to be produced
on the stage of Memorial Theater
August 1, 2, and 3.
All costumes for Oliver Gold
smith's gay comedy of the eighteenth
century will be completed by the
addition of wigs. Those for the
women are made of white horsehair

braid, and ornamented with ribbons,
jewels, roses, and more ribbon.
The wigs for the men are made
from mohair; one worn by a "gentle
man of the old school" is yellow, and
27 inches long. The young aristo
crats wear short, v/hite wigs tied in
a queue.
PANNIERED DRESSES
Designed by Helen Green, the huge
panniered dresses are so wide that
Technical Director Waldemar Jo
hansen had to build special stairs
and doorways to allow them to pass
through. On some of the more
sumptuous dresses the panniers are
four feet wide.
Heavy brocades and satins, liber
ally splashed with lace and jewels
are vised for the women's dresses.
The men wear colorful clothes of
corduroy, with knee breeches and
hose. Over their shoulders they

â–ºihiuw dashing capes of jewel colors.
Swooping hat brims and ostrich
feather plumes are worn by Miss
Neville and Miss Hardcastle.
REVOLVING STAGE
Mr. Johansen built the three sets
for the production on a revolving
stage. The scenes range from the
interior of the Hardcastle home,
with its wide chimney place, to the
heavily beamed interior of the vil
lage inn. Two huge trees will be
used in the garden scene.
The lavish late Georgian costumes,
tsamed with the riotous comedy of
Dr. Margery Bailey as Mrs. Hard
castle and Bud Cady as Tony
Lumpkin, will bring to Stanford a
colorful, almost professional pro
duction. In fact, all the actors in the
cast with the exception of Betty Ann
Higgins and Lorne Stanley have at
one time or the other been profes
sional actors.
