# Martin Supports Hull's Proposal

### 
If any European nation attempts
to transfer to itself the American
colonies of any other European na
tions, the United States will take up
arms to prevent it, Dr. Charles E.
Martin, visiting professor of polit
ical science, said here yesterday.
Commenting in favor of Secretary
of State Cordell Hull's address to
the convention of 20 American re
publics convened in Havana, Dr.
Martin added that he believed the

United States alone would uphold
the recommended trusteeship of this
hemisphere as proposed by Secretary
Hull, in the event the co-operation
of the smaller nations was not ob
tained.
