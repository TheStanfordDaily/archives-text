# Oral Prevention of Syphilis Found by Stanford Medicos?
## Declare Sobisminol Capsules 100 per cent Effective in Animals 
### 
What may be an answer to the age-old problem of syphilis treatment
has been found by three Stanford University professors.
The answer Ls in the form of pills made of a synthetic compound
called sobisminol. Experiments on animals have shown that the pills, when
properly administered, render 100 per cent cures.

> Experiments on human beings are
now under way in several American
cities.
According to Doctors P. J. Hanz
lik, A. J. Lehman and W. Van
Winkle, Jr., of the School of Medi
cine, the method is entirely effective
for the experimental animals.
The effects of sobisminol, they in
dicated, are due to the bismuth con
tained in the compound. Bismuth
is one of the three chemicals that
are lethal to the syphilis germs. The
others are mercury, used for cen
turies against the disease, and ar
senic, now used to treat the disease
in the form of salvarsan, or "606."
Both the mercury and arsenic are
too dangerous for the patient, unless
they are already infected.
BISMUTH PREVENTIVE
Many years ago, European work
ers in this field showed that bismuth
had curative properties in the treat
ment of syphilis. It was also discov
ered, following a ten-year experi
ment in the Polish city of Lodz, that
bismuth could prevent the infection.
The injections of the old com
pounds proved too painful and too
unpleasant for the patient to be of
any practical use to the medical
world.
Four years ago, the Stanford sci
entists discovered the compound
known today as sobisminol, a new
form of bismuth that could be taken
by mouth. Announced publicly only
last year, sobisminol has been and is
being tested in many hospitals and
has been proven effective in the
treatment of any stage of the dreaded
disease.
SIX CAPSULES DAILY
Recently the group attempted to
determine the protective use of the
compound. They dissolved sobis
minol in the drinking water of rab
bits and then tried to transmit the
syphilis germ to the animals. The
attempt proved the chemical was
effective.
By calculation, the scientists
showed that similar protection might
be expected in human being follow
ing the administration of six sobis
minol capsules a day. They empha
sized the advisability of using this
powerful drug under the direct su
pervision of a competent physician.
