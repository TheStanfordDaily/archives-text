# Rowdy Comedy To Be Given Here This Week
## 'Stoops to Conquer' Features Original Lines and Settings 
### 
Broad, rowdy, and slapstick was
England at the time of Oliver Gold
smith, and that is the way the Stan
ford players will play "She Stoops
to Conquer" on Thursday, Friday,
and Saturday.
Director F. Cowles Strickland has
decided he will present the comedy
in the farcical vein in which it was
written, instead of handling it with
velvet mittens and an air of respect.
The original five-act form will be
kept, with no attempt to cut the
action down to the modern three-act
form. Even the epilogue will be
presented to give the performance
the complete air of the 18th century.
BRITISH HORSEPLAY
Loud, bawdy, British horseplay
runs throughout "She Stoops to Con
quer," and the comedy parts will be
correspondingly raucous. Bud Cady
trips down flights of stairs, and Dr.
Margery Bailey glowers beneath her
brows as Mrs. Hardcastle, and yells
at the top of her voice.
Only local references have been
cut from the play. In the main part,
the original lines are followed ex
actly. Though the acotrs were hes
itant at first about speaking in the
wordy, Latinized way of Ben Jon
son and the classicists, they now reel
off the pompous phrases with never
a hitch.
COUNTRY GENTLEMEN
Beneath the prudish manners of
the day there lurked the bumptious
country ways of generations of
English country gentlemen.
That is what F. Cowles Strickland
will emphasize in his production
this week.
The lavish, panniered dresses of
brocade, and the towering wigs were
designed by Helen Green to fit the
sumptuous elegance of the period.
The costumes stand out against the
quaint English settings of Waldemar
Johansen.
Performances being at 8:15 o'clock
in Memorial Theater.
