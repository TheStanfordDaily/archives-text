# Mutual Head Defends Ban Of Hitler from Air
## Weiss Says Action Approved by Radio Listeners' Letters 
### 
"Why did I cut Hitler off the air?
Simply because I could see no rea
son why the man should be permitted
to use our time and air to justify
his crimes."
Thus Lewis Allen Weiss, Los An
geles vice-president of the Mutual
Broadcasting Company, while at
tending the Radio and Education
Conference on the Stanford campus
last week, defended his widely ad
vertised action.
Mr. Weiss, who created some
thing of an international crisis a
week or so ago when he summarily
cut Adolf Hitler's speech to the
Reichstag off the air on 32 stations
of the Don Lee Broadcasting Sys
tem, added that his action was spon
taneous and was prompted by right
eous indignation.
"I acted on my own volition, and
not as a matter of company policy,"
Mr. Weiss said, "and a great many
people seemed to agree with my ac
tion, judging from the hundreds of
letters of approval we have received
since then."
NAZIS FINALLY PACIFIED
Mr. Weiss incurred the official
wrath of Nazi Germany, and not un
til day before yesterday did the Mu
tual Broadcasting Company become
reinstated to Nazi good graces.
Here to take part in the discussion
between broadcasters and educators
with regard to the future of educa
tion by radio, Mr. Weiss strongly up
held the persuasive powers of radio
in the field of reasoning.
He pointed to the almost unprece
dented switch of Louisiana Demo
crats to the Republican program a
week ago as evidence of the ability
of radio to affect the reasoning pow
ers of its listeners.
Mr. Weiss's daughter, Patsy Sue,
will enter Stanford next fall as a
freshman.
