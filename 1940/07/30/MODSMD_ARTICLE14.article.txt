# Expert Claims Radio Workshop Is Valuable
## Air Education Will Be Harder For Teacher Dr. Power Asserts More Preparation Will Be Necessary 
### 
Although radio did not help Hitler
to power it maintains him, Dr.
Leonard Power, co-ordinator of
Research for the Federal Radio Ed
ucation Committee, Washington,
D.C., told the Conference on Radio
and Education Thursday. He pre
dicted that all colleges and high
school systems will be preparing
programs, and that more stations
will be owned and operated by edu
cational institutions than commercial
corporations.
With the development of television
and greater clarity of sound a radio
workshop will be just as essential as
a chemical laboratory in universities,
he stated.
TEACHING JUST AS HARD
In clarifying some of the popular
fallacies Dr. Powers said that radio
will not make teaching easier as
more research and preparation on
the part of the teacher will be nec
essary to answer questions of pupils.
Radio is not as effective as read
ing for gaining information, he said,
but radio can supplement learned
material.
The fourth general session of the
Conference on Radio and Education,
held on Friday evening, was directed
to the general purpose of finding
workable answers to the question,
How can broadcasters and education
al institutions in the Far West work
together more effectively?
EXPERTS QUESTIONED
The plan of the conference was to
challenge the experts with questions
concerning the educational and pub
lic service use of radio questions
raised by the previous sessions.
One of the first questions raised
was in regard to the prediction of
3,000 educational radio stations to
dot our country in the future, when
so many stations of this type have
disappeared for lack of funds.
In answer to this, Dr. Leonard
Power, co-ordinator of research for
the Federal Radio Education Com
mittee, said that the colleges were
not losing stations. Actually, they
have been granted increases in time
and power, their appropriations in
creased, and their staffs enlarged. Dr.
Power added.
Another point raised and agreed to
by the board was that broadcasters
should and were in fact extremely
eager to help educational programs
which put across their program witn
the showmanship used in commer
cial broadcasting.
C. E. Arney, Jr., of the National
Association of Broadcasters, was
asked why, after the forming of the
National Association of Broadcasters,

most children's programs were still
definitely inferior.
Mr. Arney replied, "Since the
forming of the N.A.8., every effort
has been exerted to encourage im
provement in children's programs,
although there is admittedly a need
ior additional conditioning.
SLOW IMPROVEMENT
"One of the reasons for the slow
ness of improvement is the necessity
of working over scripts of all run
ning programs slowly, so as not to
lose listeners," he added.
"What is the broad, general policy
adopted by broadcasters in regard
to censox*ship?" was another ques
tion asked of Mr. Arney. He an
swered to the effect that the Federal
law provided that nothing be broad
cast contrary to the public interest,
and broadcasters attempted to ful
fill this to the best of their ability.
SETTLE RESPONSIBILITY
In response to the question as to
whose responsibility it is to chal
lenge statements which do not result
in the public good, such as health
misstatements, the board agreed that
the responsibility for statements
false and misleading is definitely the
broadcasters. The most help comes
from the Federal Trade Commission
in investigating advertising claims,
they said.
The conference closed with a re
statement of the annual radio au
dience criticism of radio announcers
and product advertising, the only an
swer vouchsafed, being that the big
gest problem of commercial broad
casting today is that it still suffers
from "sponsoritis."

lose listeners," he added.
"What is the broad, general policy
adopted by broadcasters in regard
to censox*ship?" was another ques
tion asked of Mr. Arney. He an
swered to the effect that the Federal
law provided that nothing be broad
cast contrary to the public interest,
and broadcasters attempted to ful
fill this to the best of their ability.
SETTLE RESPONSIBILITY
In response to the question as to
whose responsibility it is to chal
lenge statements which do not result
in the public good, such as health
misstatements, the board agreed that
the responsibility for statements
false and misleading is definitely the
broadcasters. The most help comes
from the Federal Trade Commission
in investigating advertising claims,
they said.
The conference closed with a re
statement of the annual radio au
dience criticism of radio announcers
and product advertising, the only an
swer vouchsafed, being that the big
gest problem of commercial broad
casting today is that it still suffers
from "sponsoritis."
Although radio did not help Hitler
to power it maintains him, Dr.
Leonard Power, co-ordinator of
Research for the Federal Radio Ed
ucation Committee, Washington,
D.C., told the Conference on Radio
and Education Thursday. He pre
dicted that all colleges and high
school systems will be preparing
programs, and that more stations
will be owned and operated by edu
cational institutions than commercial
corporations.
With the development of television
and greater clarity of sound a radio
workshop will be just as essential as
a chemical laboratory in universities,
he stated.
TEACHING JUST AS HARD
In clarifying some of the popular
fallacies Dr. Powers said that radio
will not make teaching easier as
more research and preparation on
the part of the teacher will be nec
essary to answer questions of pupils.
Radio is not as effective as read
ing for gaining information, he said,
but radio can supplement learned
material.
The fourth general session of the
Conference on Radio and Education,
held on Friday evening, was directed
to the general purpose of finding
workable answers to the question,
How can broadcasters and education
al institutions in the Far West work
together more effectively?
EXPERTS QUESTIONED
The plan of the conference was to
challenge the experts with questions
concerning the educational and pub
lic service use of radio questions
raised by the previous sessions.
One of the first questions raised
was in regard to the prediction of
3,000 educational radio stations to
dot our country in the future, when
so many stations of this type have
disappeared for lack of funds.
In answer to this, Dr. Leonard
Power, co-ordinator of research for
the Federal Radio Education Com
mittee, said that the colleges were
not losing stations. Actually, they
have been granted increases in time
and power, their appropriations in
creased, and their staffs enlarged. Dr.
Power added.
Another point raised and agreed to
by the board was that broadcasters
should and were in fact extremely
eager to help educational programs
which put across their program witn
the showmanship used in commer
cial broadcasting.
C. E. Arney, Jr., of the National
Association of Broadcasters, was
asked why, after the forming of the
National Association of Broadcasters,

most children's programs were still
definitely inferior.
Mr. Arney replied, "Since the
forming of the N.A.8., every effort
has been exerted to encourage im
provement in children's programs,
although there is admittedly a need
ior additional conditioning.
SLOW IMPROVEMENT
"One of the reasons for the slow
ness of improvement is the necessity
of working over scripts of all run
ning programs slowly, so as not to
lose listeners," he added.
