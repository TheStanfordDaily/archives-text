# Radio Education Solution Suggested
## 
### 
Ultra-high frequency stations was
the solution offered by Jennings
Pierce, San Francisco, for the prob
lem of radio education Friday to the
Conference on Radio and Education,
in discussing "Transcriptions and Re
cordings for School Use."
Mr. Pierce, director of education
of the Western Division of the Na
tional Broadcasting Company, as
serted that these stations would be
the only possible answer for getting
radios to be used in schools through
out the nation as educational aids.
The cause of the difficulty is that
time varies to such an extent
throughout the country, he explain
ed. Under these circumstances it is
impossible for a national broadcast
to be available to both teachers and
students at convenient times.
RADIO TRANSCRIPTIONS
Recordings of radio programs was
another solution offered. This, ac
cording to Mr. Pierce, would present
a greater cost than direct radio re
ception of broadcasts. However, he
said, NBC is now prepared to offer
transcriptions for sale to schools at
a nominal costâ€”3o-minute record
ings as $3 each.
The problem of radio education
was discussed from the educational
as well as the broadcaster's point of
view. Robert W. Dumm, director of
speical events, KSFO, San Francisco,
reported on a poll which he took
last year which showed a tremend
ous lack of radios in schools, espe

cially in the rural areas.
Sterling Fisher of CBS, however,
struck a note of encouragement for
radio education when he announced
that the "American School of the
Air" program is now being broad
cast to South America via short
wave.
