## Federal Radio Expert List Idiosyncrasies Of Listener Audience 
### 
Childless persons will listen to
child guidance programs over the
radio in order to have the vicarious
satisfaction of giving advice to
young mothers.
This, and many similar idiosyncra
sies of the American radio audience
were described by Dr. Paul F. Laz
arsfeld, of the Federal Radio Educa
tion Committee and the Office of
Radio Research, Columbia Univer
sity, before the Conference on Ra
dio and Education Friday.
Dr. Lazarsfeld, a nationally known
expert on the reactions and capaci
ties of the vast radio audience, has
arrived at many other equally un
usual conclusions:
Approximately 50 per cent of the
news-broadcast audience had no in
terest in news before the radio de
veloped it, and today listens largely
for the "story" interest in national
and international happenings. A
large part of this group is composed
of women—usually young women.
McCarthy bigger draw
Even the most successful educa
tional programs will draw a radio
audience no more than one thirty
fifth the size of Charlie McCarthy's.
The bulk of the day-time "serial"
audience has no telephones, hence
is hard to count.
Network stations have a "higher
class" audience than small, inde
pendent stations and the 35 noncom
mercial stations have the most highly
educated listeners of all.
People like to think they are be
ing educated and listen to programs
like "Professor Quiz" with that in
mind. A program with a contest
factor such as the "question-an
swer" variety, draws heavily on any
program.
NO PROPAGANDA EFFECT
Except in supplying prestige
which is capitalized on by local
groups in the interests of such pro
grams as the Townsend movement,
the radio has no great propaganda
effect. Few programs in themselves
actually persuade. If the listener is
an educated person, he will selec
tively reinforce his own views.
