# Erie Co., Ohio, Is Radio Test Tube
## 
### 
Erie County, Ohio, has been se
lected as the "test tube" of the na
tion's susceptibility to the political
radio program, according to Paul F.
Lazarsfeld, government radio re
search expert at Stanford for the
Conference on Radio and Education.
In Erie County, which always votes
the way the nation as a whole votes
in national elections, there has been
formed a panel of 600 persons, as
well as three "control" groups of 200
persons each to assure accuracy of
findings.
The basic 600 will be interviewed
weekly for their reactions to the
radio programs they heard.
In cases where a political opinion
is believed to have been changed by
a broadcast the listener will be ques
tioned by a psychologist to see if the
exact reason for this effect can be
determined. Another phase of the
program will be the work of 50
"checkers," who will analyze all
printed matter that enters the
county as to its political significance.

It is estimated that the German
air force uses 2000 gallons of gaso
line daily on war duties.
