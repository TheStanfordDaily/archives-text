will be published August 1. It is

preparing high school students for
college entrance and for practical

Volume 2, published a few years
ago, is for junior high school stu
dents and deals with such matters of
interest to children of that age as
the care and training of pets, tech
niques for athletic games, and re
quirements and qualifications for
various jobs.
The third book, more recently pub
lished, is for slightly older children
and deals, for example, with prob
lems of safety and personal care.
Book I, the last to be published, will
be for seventh grade children and
will contain material on how to
skate, stories about animals, stories
of children in other lands, and ar
ticles of human interest.

Read," by Professor Holland D.
Roberts, in colalboration with Miss
Helen Rand and Lauriston Tardy.
Designated as Volume 4, the book
will be published August 1. It is
intended, said Professor Roberts, for
preparing high school students for
college entrance and for practical
use in everyday life. For instance —
how to read a menu, a time table,
etc.
Volume 2, published a few years
ago, is for junior high school stu
dents and deals with such matters of
interest to children of that age as
the care and training of pets, tech
niques for athletic games, and re
quirements and qualifications for
various jobs.
The third book, more recently pub
lished, is for slightly older children
and deals, for example, with prob
lems of safety and personal care.
Book I, the last to be published, will
be for seventh grade children and
will contain material on how to
skate, stories about animals, stories
of children in other lands, and ar
