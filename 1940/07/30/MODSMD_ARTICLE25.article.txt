# Allen to Contrast Early Sonatas
## 
### 
Professor Warren D. Allen will
substitute another lecture on key
board music for the usual organ re
cital on Thursday afternoon at 4:15
o'clock in the Education Auditorium.
The subject will be "The Sonata â€”
from Bach to Beethoven."
Beginning with Bach and Scar
latti and continuing through Mozart
and Haydn, the program will con
trast the different kinds of 18th cen
tury music which were called so
natas.
The lecture-recital will conclude
with an early sonata of Beethoven
in order to provide a prelude for
the Beethoven sonata recitals which
begin August 6. Professor Allen will
show how the sonata form was made
the basis for chamber music and de
scribe some of the unique contribu
tions made in that field.
