# 'South Seas' To Be Topic For Tuesday Series
## Dr. Lambert Will Tell Tales of Island Magic And Native Witchery 
### 
"Magic in the South Seas" will be
the subject of a lecture by Dr. S. M.
Lambert, formerly director of the
South Pacific Area, International Di
vision, of the Rockefeller Founda
tion, to be given in the Tuesday Eve
ning Series tonight at 8 o'clock in
the Auditoi'ium of Memorial Hall.
Dr. Lambert is internationally
known as the man with a million
patients, and has seen more of the
South Seas than any other white
man. His visits in the South Sea
Island territory have covered more
than 100,000 miles and have been
made by boat, on foot, and occasion
ally by horseback. His journeys
have taken him into many remote
and hitherto unexplored isles.
During his 20 years there, Dr.
Lambert has collected what is prob
ably the most astounding collection
of stories of witchcraft and magic
ever to come from that region. Some
of these stories will be presented in
his talk.
MEDICINE TO NATIVES
Dr. Lambert brought medicine to
the South Seas and instituted, with
the help of the Rockefeller Founda
tion, a plan for teaching medicine to
the natives â€”a work which will long
be perpetuated.
Retired now by the Rockefeller
Foundation, Dr. Lambert regards his
establishment of a medical school for
the training of native practitioners
as the greatest single achievement of
his 20 years of service in the tropics.
He was aided in this enterprise by
the Queen of Tonga.
It has been said of him that he has
a larger fund of experiences and
stories about these people of the
South Seas and their customs than
anyone else, and they are told with
humor and real understanding.
