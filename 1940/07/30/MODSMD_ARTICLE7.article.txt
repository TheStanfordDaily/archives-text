# Junior High Children Desert Housing Discussion for War
## 
### 
"If the United States didn't spend
all our money to send ships to Brit
ain, we could build better houses."
The little blonde pessimist banged
on the table, and deftly turned a
classroom discussion of housing
problems to the subject of the Eu
ropean war.
"Gwan," a little chubby boy far
ther down the table said, "let's get
back to the subject," but his voice
was drowned in a flood of heated
words. You can't talk about any
thing at all today without dragging
in the war—even in front of an au
dience which has come to see you
perform as part of the demonstration
of "A Classroom in Action" for the
Conference on Radio and Education
Thursday.
RED CROSS PROBLEMS
The little boy forgot about hous
ing and said, "Say, even the Red
Cross money could be spent better
here if we just built houses with it

instead of sending it to Europe to
keep the war going."
The blonde squirmed in her red
jacket. "If they stood the slums this
long, they can stand it a little longer.
Why, the people in Europe need the
money."
The teacher coughed gently to get
the attention of the class; they dis
regarded him. The audience roared.
The 12 junior high school children
stopped giggling, and leaned harder
upon the table and ceased their pen
cil scribbling. Long before the hour
session was over, the teacher re
alized the hopelessness of the situa
tion and directed his efforts to tying
up the European War situation with
housing.
Forgotten were the 15-minute re
cordings on "I Am the Voice of the
Slums," and the attentive audience
of parents, teachers, and friends.
Junior high schoolers are thinking
of war.
