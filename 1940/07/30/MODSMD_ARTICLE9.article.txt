## Round Table Favors Compulsory Training 
### 
"What America Is to Do about
Conscription" was the subject of a
round table debate conference Sat
urday in Memorial Hall. Preceeding
the discussion, Dr. James Gordon
Emerson delivered an address on
the literary societies* of past years in
universities.
Dr. Emerson stressed the fact that
these groups played a very im
portant part in student activities and
were imbued with terrific rivalry
and tremendous loyalties.
In the discussion on conscription,
a number of points concerning the
scope necessary in a conscription
plan were brougt up. Opposition to
all types of drafting were clearly
and loudly affirmed by Jack Temple
and Miss Marie Carr on the ground
that such action would bring about
the loss of American rights and
liberties.
