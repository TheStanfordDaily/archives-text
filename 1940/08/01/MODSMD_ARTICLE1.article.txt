# Lutz Considers Possibility Of Economic War
## Trade Pact or War Only Way to Face A Victorious Germany 
### 
If Germany wins this war, the
United States has three possible
ways of facing her. One is an eco
nomic trade agreement with Ger
many, another is to wage economic
war with Germany, and the third is
to fight Germany.
Dr. Ralph Haswell Lutz thus ap
praised the current situation before
the Tuesday luncheon of the Edu
cation Club.
Dr. Lutz, professor of history at
Stanford and chairman of the Hoo
ver Library on War, Peace, and
Revolution, was in Europe for six
months immediately preceding and
after the outbreak of the present
war gathering documents.
CONTROLLED ECONOMY
The Stanford professor of history
predicted a controlled economy, per
haps even state capitalism for the
United States. There will be a new
imperialism, coming into being
largely for reasons of hemispheric
defense, he said. Other probabilities
will be economic and perhaps po
litical union with Canada and the
formation of a South American
cartel.
In Germany, Dr. Lutz said, the
declaration of war took the form of
a small poster announcing that at a
certain time, all civilian transporta
tion in Germany would cease. In
reality, this was tantamount to or
dering foreigners out of the country.
"Secret diplomacy was at its
zenith in the months directly pro
ceeding the war," he said. "Ameri
can diplomacy in particular* did its
utmost to negotiate plans for peace,
and to supporS morale among the
peoples of Europe."
GERMANY DOMINANT
Dr. Lutz heard in New York in
May, 1939, of the secret negotiations
between Hitler and Stalin, and in
June in Europe, he said, it was well
known that Hitler would settle with
Poland if she did not cede Germany
Danzig and the Corridor.
"It is obvious that Germany now
dominates the European continent
and may even conquer Britain," he
said. "The balance of power in
Europe is abrogated by the establish
ment of an hegemony."
In this connection, Dr. Lutz fore
cast that Denmark, Norway, and the
other small states of Europe will be
come vassal states of Germany.
