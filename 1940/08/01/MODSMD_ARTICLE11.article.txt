# Lambert Tells Of South Sea 'Bewitchery'
## Fiji Islanders Die When Cursed By Medicine Men 
### 
Death from the curse of a South
Sea island witch doctor is speedy
and effective.
By merely pointing a bone he can
put a native on his death bed from
which he will only rise when the
"doctor" assures him he had no
murderous motive.
Although recognized European
medical doctors could find no disease
and post-mortem revealed no disor
der of any sort, a Fiji islander died
quickly and surely from the curse
of the local witch doctor.
So ran the weird tales of Dr. S. M.
Lambert, former director of the
South Pacific Area, International Di
vision of the Rockefeller Founda
tion, last Tuesday evening in his talk
on "Magic in the South Seas."
NOBLEMAN BEWITCHED
Dr. Lambert told the involved
story of how one South Sea islander
of noble birth was "witched" by the
sorcerer of a rival tribe. Fainting
spells were followed by death.
This noble's friend, discovering
that a shark was following his boat,
returned to the village and, finding
his friend dead, sent his own witch
doctor to kill the native responsible
for his friend's death.
CHANGE NAME OFTEN
Dr. Lambert, the man with a
thousand patients, said that cata
loguing the natives medically treated
was an impossible task since they
continually changed their names so
that the spirits of their ancestors
would not return to haunt them.
Death by any other than the witch
doctor's curse is considered impos
sible.
In the medical school which Dr.
Lambert instituted he found grad
uate students who persisted in their
"outworn" beliefs.
NATIVES FEAR DOCTOR
The strange death of the island
inhabitants can be explained by the
intense fear which the tribe holds
toward its doctor, Dr. Lambert ad
mitted, but it is sometimes due to a
more mysterious power.
Dr. Lambert said he went to the
islands twenty-two years ago con
vinced that witchcraft was bunk.
However, he found that this "magic"
is the law and order, the penal code,
the religion, and supreme power
governing these primitive peoples.
