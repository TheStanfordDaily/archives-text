With but one day's play remain
ing, the Agonists and the Sparducks
have narrowed the fight for the
Wheel Chair League pennant down
to themselves. Each won their ninth
game Monday, leaving the other ten
Softball teams two or more games
back in the ruck and mathematically
out of the running.
The Sparducks backed into their
win via the forfeiture route when
the Socialists failed to appear, while
the Agonists were being hard put to
it on an adjoining field overcoming
a stubborn Accordion aggregation,
7 to 6.
The third-place Slavedrivers con
tinue to lead the rest of the pack by
virtue of the customary forfeit
handed them by the Foreign Legion.
The Prunepickers, Greer's Greas
ers, and the Accordions are all rav
eled up in a three-way tie for fourth
as a result of the Accordion's loss
to the Agonists, the Greasers' 11 to
4 win over the New Dealers, and
the Prunepickers' 8 to 5 conquest of
the Toro Bulls.
The Outlaws continued their be
lated spurt to take their fourth game
in a row, this one from the Red Gap
pers 10 to 2.
Should the Agonists and the Spar
ducks both win their respective

games this afternoon, a playoff will
ensue between them. A meeting of
team managers is called for 4:30
o'clock Thursday afternoon to ar
range the details of this possible
contest and also to fix the schedule
for the Shaughnessy playoff which
will commence next week, involving
the top six teams in the final stand
ings.
