# Schools Demand New Band Music
## 
### 
The American composer of the fu
ture will specialize in music for
schools, predicted George Antheil,
visiting lecturer of music, in his talk
yesterday.
"There is little demand for sym
phonic music in America," he said,
"but the schools are crying out for
new material for bands, orchestras,
and singing groups."
Mr. Antheil deplored the compos
ers' hard struggle for recognition,
but expressed confidence they would
soon find their place in American
life.
Following his talk, the composer
improvised on suggestions from the
audience in the manner of promi
nent modern musicians.
A recital of Mr. Antheil's works
has been scheduled for August 15, at
which time he will play his newest
composition, a ballade for the piano.
