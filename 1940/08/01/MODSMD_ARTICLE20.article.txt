Last Tuesday this department
bragged about finding a faculty
member, Professor Holland D. Rob
erts, who has recently published a
book. But wait, you haven't seen
anything yet. Now we announce a
faculty member who is just pub
lishing a whole double fist full of
texts. He is Associate Professor
Lucien B. Kinney and he is collabo
rator wtih Dr. Harl R. Douglass,
dean of the College of Education at
the University of Colorado and
formerly at Stanford. They have just
got out no fewer than six new math
ematics texts for junior and senior
high schools.
One series of three volumes is for
grades 7, 8 and 9, entitled "Mathe
matics for Today," and is intended
to precede tenth grade algebra, elev
enth grade geometry, and twelfth
grade trigonometry. The other series
of three is entitled "Junior Mathe
matics" and "Everyday Mathemat
ics."
Professor Kinney also has a book
entitled "The Consumer," sched
uled for publication next winter as a
reference book for junior high
schools. Four years ago Professor
Kinney published "Business Mathe
matics."

New to the Stanford Education
faculty this summer are Associate
Professor and Mrs. Lucien B. Kin
ney. They come here from Oswego

Normal School, New York,
where Dr. Kinney was head of the
department of mathematics and act
ing registrar.
"We have never lived this far west
before," said Dr. Kinney, "but in
1929 we spent considerable time
here on a camping trip."
Formerly from Minnesota, Dr.
Kinney expressed no disappoint
ment at being away from the east
ern climate. He did, however, show
curiosity as to the heating facilities
of the Education Building. The Kin
neys are living at 350 Miramonte.

Teacher Development Workshop
will close its summer activities at a
dinner tonight in Wilson's Confec
taurant at 6:30 o'clock. Approxi
mately 50 persons will attend, it
was announced. There will be a pro
gram of entertainment, including
community singing, impersonations
by Wallace Murray of San Jose, and
a skit directed by Walter Isle,
workshop staff member. Dr. Alvin
C. Eurich, professor of education,
will be master of ceremonies.

Dean and Mrs. Kefauver will be at
home to the School of Education
faculty and students Sunday from 4
to 6 o'clock. They live at 678 Mirada.
It's not too hard to find Mirada
Street and the Kefauvers' home. An
other way to go about it is to pre
tend you're trying to get several dif
ferent views of the Hoover home
(after you find it) and to wander all
around the little twists and turns of
streets and by-paths that form the
intricate maze in the neighborhood.
Eventually you will come to the Ke
fauvers. But even if you use this
method of getting there, it will be
worth it.
