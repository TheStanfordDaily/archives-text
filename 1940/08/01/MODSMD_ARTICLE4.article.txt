# Foundation For New Cyclotron Is Completed
## New Neutron Source To Be Operating Before Next Year 
### 
With the completion of the founda
tions for Stanford's new $4,000 cyclo
tron, plans for the erection of the
new neutron source are rapidly
nearing completion, it was an
nounced yesterday. The equipment
is expected to be operating within
a year.
Working on the plans for t\e
machine, which is to be entirely con
structed at Stanford, are Doctors
Felix Bloch, N. E. Bradbury, and
Hans Staub.
An energy of 2,000,000 electron
volts is expected to be generated by
the new cyclotron in comparison with
the 200,000 produced by the former
equipment, Dr. Staub said today.
BERYLLIUM TO BE TARGET
Further experiments by Dr. Bloch
in the measurement of the magnetic
moment of the neutron are expected
to be made, while Dr. Staub hopes
to find additional information on the
scattering of neutrons.
A water-jacket is to be built
around the machine to protect the
operators from the harmful effects of
the stream of neutrons thrown off by
the cyclotron.
To produce the neutrons, ions of
the heavy isotope of hydrogen are
accelerated and shot at beryllium
atoms. The acceleration is accomp
lished by an oscillating electric field
between the poles of a large electro
magnet.
Size of the magnet and the strength
of its field determine the number of
electron volts a deutron may ac
quire, Dr. Staub explained. Al
though the new equipment will not
be nearly as expensive as that at
the University of California, it will
be adequate for the present needs.
