# American Comic Spirit Praised
## Myna Beuton Hughes Discusses Comedy On Stanford-on-Air 
### 
"So long as men and nations can
laugh, they remain unafraid. The
preservation and fostering, then, of
the comic spirit is a precious and
worthy activity; it is, indeed, a se
rious and necessary one, for a people
who can no longer laugh, truly are
doomed."
This statement was made by Myna
Brunton Hughes, director-in-chief
of the Dramatists' Alliance on the
Stanford Universityâ€”On the Air
program last night in an address on
"An American Comic Spirit."
Miss Hughes pointed out that a
glance at the current American or
British stage reveals that only com
edy, farce, and musical revues are
being patronized by the public at
present. This, she continued, is the
case at any period of stress in his
tory.
FULL LENGTH PLAYS
In a yearly nationwide contest,
she said, the comedies for the most
part were found to be full length
plays. This, she asserted, encourages
the belief that the new generation
of playwrights are giving their at
tention to a thorough treatment of
their comic inspiration.
Most of these plays, she said, deal
with familiar elements of the Ameri
can scene, such as the W.P.A., the
maneuvers of politicians, or the un
failing American love for entering
prize contests. The Southern feud,
and the setting offered by tourist
motel or auto camps, also have their
share as sources of comedy, she
added.
As far as the worth of the play is
concerned, according to Miss Hughes,
the dramatic technique is faulty in
varying degrees. Another aspect
which confuses beginners, she said,
is the matter of scene building, and
a third weakness is unconvincing
character motivation.
MODERN LIFE TOPICS
"It is for these beginning writers
who are dealing with vivid and
stimulating topics from contempo
rary American life that the Drama
tists Alliance of Stanford University
exists. It exists in order to encour
age them, and it hopes they will
continue to support it by their writ
ing.
For, if the Alliance can continue to
offer a channel through which the
American comic spirit may be ex
pressed, it is rendering a worthy
service, not only to American play
wrights but also to the agencies that
strengthen and foster national
morale."
