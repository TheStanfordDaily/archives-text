# School Budgets Will Be Cut By Arms Program
## Educator Warns: Combat Curtailment-Organize Association 
### 
Schools will be the first to feel
budget cuts when the armament
program is in full swing, asserted
Frederick Redefer of New York, ex
ecutive secretary of the Progressive
Education Association, who spoke on
"Vital Issues Facing Progressive
Education in the United States" at
a dinner meeting attended by 70
members of the local group Friday
evening.
He urged immediate action.
"The association must be organ
ized before the curtailment goes into
effect," he warned.
Mr. Redefer pointed out that
school programs will no longer be
formulated by local boards, but by a
national committee.
"If the Progressive Education As
sociation wants to be that commit
tee, it must prove its aiblity," he
said.
Educational programs must be
more practical than in the previous
crisis, he advised.
"Discipline and the three R's will
be stressed, but educators must re
alize that American youth cannot be
'spanked' into conscription."
WAR CONCEPT IS CHANGED
Vocational education will be an
important factor in the national de
fense curriculum, according to Mr.
Redefer.
"Our concept of war has changed,"
he exclaimed. "No difference is now
recognized between civil and mili
tary affairs. The whole population
of warring countries becomes in
volved in modern warfare."
Grayson N. Kefauver, dean of the
Stanford School of Education,
pleaded for even more vigorous pro
motion of democracy through edu
cation than in normal times.
