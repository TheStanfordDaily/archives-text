# Farm Players In Old Comedy
## 'Stoops to Conquer' Has Three-night Run 
### 
As far as efforts go, the Stanford
Players spared none in their pro
duction last Thursday, Friday, and
Saturday of "She Stoops to Con
quer," but ragged acting and inaccu
rate details spoiled some of the ef
fort in the opening night perform
ance.
In the leading comedy role of
Tony Lumpkin, Bud Cady injected
a touch of farm boy awkwardness
and slyeness that made his charac
terization one of the most pleasing
of the whole cast. Except for the
wonderful assortment of misshapen,
gangling servants, none could match
his country bumpkin air.
PROMPTER'S VOICE HEARD
As usual, Dr. Margery Bailey
played her part with vigor, and
brought to life all the venom and
affectation of Mrs. Hardcastle. Miss
Hardcastle, played by Myna Brun
ton Hughes, had a tendency to
simper and bounce all over the stage
in a sprightly, and slightly confus
ing manner, while she flirted and
schemed with true eighteenth cen
tury gaiety.
Thursday's performance was
marked by an excessive amount of
prompting which allowed the
prompter's strenuous voice to pene
trate to even the remotest recesses
of the theater.
ACTORS HAVE DIFFICULTY
Betty Ann Higgins played Miss
Neville with a good deal of restraint,
and managed to look very pretty be
sides. Lome Stanley and Dick Glyer
as young Marlowe and Mr. Hastings
found but little difficulty with their
parts except in the matter of lines.
For a modern audience the play
undoubtedly would have been bet
ter presented in three-act form, but
Director F. Cowles Strickland man
aged to keep the tempo from lagging
too much.
Helen Green's costumes were col
orful and authentic. Waldemar Jo
hansen turned out another good set
that allowed quick changes and had
much to do with speeding up the
play.
