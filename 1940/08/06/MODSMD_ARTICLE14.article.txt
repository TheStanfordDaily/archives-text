This column remarked one year
ago on the excellent quality and the
abundance of apricots and other
iruits that Professor Holland D.
Roberts used to bring to the School
of Education office. Well, this year
he is ministering to the esthetic

brings huge baskets of cut flowers
from his own garden. And the sup
ply seems inexhaustible.
