# Chaplin Movies To Be Shown
## Dramatists' Alliance Presents Early Films 
### 
As the final event of the comedy
series sponsored this summer by
Dramatists' Alliance a program of
three early Chaplin films and dis
cussions of the comedian's technique
will be presented Thursday evening
at 8:15 o'clock in the Education
Auditorium.
The films to be shown will be
chosen from among such early and
rarely seen one- and two-reelers as
"The Tramp," Easy Street," "Laugh
ing Gas," "His Trysting Place," "Be
tween Showers," and "In the Park."
These films are so rarely seen be
cause Mr. Chaplin has been calling
them in and refusing to have them
shown.
ORIGINAL COMEDY
According to those who have seen
them, they represent some of his
freshest v and most original comic in
spiration. It has been said, too, that
they reveal particularly the Comme
dia dell 'Arte technique which
Chaplin uses to fine effect, making
him one of the best modern ex
ponents of one of the oldest forms of
popular comedy.
An exhibit in which the conven

tions of Commedia dell 'Arte, from
which his comic art stems, is in the
library cases. It shows the develop
ment of popular comedy from the
early 16th century Italian extempore
comedy to the techniques of some
of our most popular modern clowns
and comedians.
