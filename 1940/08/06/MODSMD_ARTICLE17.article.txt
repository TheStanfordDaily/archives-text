## Gridders Toil At Summer Jobs 
### 
Stanford's 1940 varsity footballers,
though spread to the four corners
of the land for the summer, exhibit
remarkable singularity in their
choice of vacation jobs in that they
seem to prefer brawn-developing
occupations.
Here on the campus Norm Stand
lee and Milt Vucinich are pushing
lawnmowers around the golf course.
Collin McClintock and Cookie South
are mixing concrete on the Shasta
Dam project.
Pete Kmetovich is driving an oil
truck in San Jose, while Chuck
Taylor is a section hand on the
Southern Pacific a few miles to the
soutl near Watsonville.
Chick Orme and Stan Graff are'
punching cows on an Arizona ranch
and Doug Stahle burrows in a near
by Nevada gold mine. A1 Cole, Hank
Norberg, and Clyde Jeffrey, who has
decided to take a fling at the grid
iron sport this fall, are all members
of construction gangs through the
south.
Bob Crane, Bill Willard, and Ed
McKain are clambering around the
oil derricks near Avon, California,
while Hugh Gallerneau is back in
Chicago acting as a life guard at a
municipal pool.
Engaged in pursuits not quite so
strenuous are Eric Armstrong and
Dick Palmer, who are taking the
flying course at Stanford, and Bruno
Banducci, who guards a gate for a
Richmond oil company.
