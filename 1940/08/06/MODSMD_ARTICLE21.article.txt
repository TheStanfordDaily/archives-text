# Protective Tiling Replaced For First Time in Six Years
## 
### 
Believe it or not—the tiling on a roof is not for the protection of the
roof. Instead it protects the paper that in turn protects the roof. However,
the tile has to he of such a make as to afford the paper a real protection,
according to James W. McDonnell, superintendent of buildings and grounds.
The old tiles at Stanford (pre-1906) were an imitation tin tile that was
changed to the present tile about

year of the earthquake. This tile
was the American tile that is now
being changed where it is in need of
change.
The last time that any tiles were
changed on the campus was in
1934. At present the tiles are being
changed to again protect the paper-
The old American style tile was
nailed to the roof and if there was
any need to change a broken tile
then the entire roof had to be re
moved. The new, or Cordova, style
is wired to an anchorage that en
ables the removal of one tile at a
time, rather than the whole roof.
The old tile was arranged in such
a way that siphonage of water was
fostered by the tile rather than dis
couraged by it. The new tile is
placed in an entirely new position

that completely hinders the passage
of water to the paper guarding the
roof.
Asphaltum impregnated felt, prop
erly called 30-pound roofing paper,
because it is 30 pounds to the hun
dred square feet, is the paper that
is being placed on top of the roofs.
On top of this goes one-eighth of an
inch of hot tar that contains a goodly
percentage of asphalt.
Tiles always leak. Mr. McDonnell
says, using as an example the old
adobe houses of the California coast
which gained a good reputation be
cause the old grandees were more
adept at dodging the falling water
than is present-day man.
Involving a cost of $12,000 the
tiles are being removed by the R. L.
Reeves Roofing Co.

is wired to an anchorage that en
ables the removal of one tile at a
time, rather than the whole roof.
The old tile was arranged in such
a way that siphonage of water was
fostered by the tile rather than dis
couraged by it. The new tile is
placed in an entirely new position

that completely hinders the passage
of water to the paper guarding the
roof.
Asphaltum impregnated felt, prop
erly called 30-pound roofing paper,
because it is 30 pounds to the hun
dred square feet, is the paper that
is being placed on top of the roofs.
On top of this goes one-eighth of an
inch of hot tar that contains a goodly
percentage of asphalt.
Tiles always leak. Mr. McDonnell
says, using as an example the old
adobe houses of the California coast
which gained a good reputation be
cause the old grandees were more
adept at dodging the falling water
than is present-day man.
Involving a cost of $12,000 the
tiles are being removed by the R. L.
Reeves Roofing Co.
