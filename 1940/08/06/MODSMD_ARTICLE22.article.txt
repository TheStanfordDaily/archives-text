# Nineteen-Year-Old Stanford Honor Code Still Successful
## 
### 
Although the Stanford Honor Code is a standard applying to all phases
of student life, it applies most practically to the taking of examinations.
Because of the approach of final exams, and the fact that many summer
quarter students are not familiar with the Honor Code, The Stanford Daily
is co-operating with Men's and Women's Councils, whose duties include
the inculcation of the Honor Code, ♦ —

by presenting two articles on this
subject.—Editors' Note
Stanford's now-famous Honor
Code was adopted 19 years ago on
the petitions of 1,700 members of the
student body. Granted by the Uni
versity Academic Council, only
conditionally at first, the revolution
ary program has had a signal suc
cess, and is today considered by
Stanford men and women as one of
the highlights of the history of the
Farm.
Astounding as the prospect of
transferring the full responsibility
lor student conduct to the members
of the student body at first seemed,
the classes of 1921, and those that
have followed, quickly adopted
themselves to the Code; and it has
become an integral and highly ap
preciated factor of student life.
The student appeal for the ap
plication of the honor system was a
natural reaction from the intensive
and irritating "proctored" and
teacher - controlled examinations
given in countless high schools and
colleges. From examinations in
which a contest-element had been
introduced by continual efforts of
students to "beat" the teacher by
cheating, Stanford undergraduates
hoped for a more intelligent system.
USED IN LAW SCHOOL
They found it in a system which
had been devised for the Stanford
law school some years previous, and
used with recognized success among
graduate students. Its primary ele
ments are still present in our Stan
ford Honor Code of 1940.
It was this hope of the students of
1921 that enables today's undergrad
uates to leave their exams for a
moment of relaxation or a smoke off
the Quad, that leaves the professor
free to remain in his office and an
swer the questions of students
puzzled by exam questions, that en
ables Accounting students to take
thier balance-sheets to the library,
and English professors to return
compositions to tyro-writers.
NO PROCTORS
Students who come to Stanford
from other institutions used to the
ever-present proctor patrolling the
aisles, are usually so refreshed by
freedom offered here that they feel
almost compensated for having to
take examinations at all.
Although perhaps most severely
tested in the student examination,
the Honor Code is by no means lim
ited to this phase of Stanford life.
It is almost all-inclusive and just as
broad as Stanford's first president,
Dr. David Starr Jordan's require
ments when he said:
"Students are expected to show, I
both within and without the Univer
sity, such respect for order, moral
ity, honor, and the rights of others,
as is demanded of good citizens."
OTHER VIOLATIONS
Disregarding the library rules, all 1
forms of plagiarism, the use of an
other person's composition, even
with his permission, handing iden
tical material in for two courses, all

these are specific violations of the
Code. But "conduct unbecoming a
Stanford man or woman" is an addi
tional violation which the Men's and
Women's Councils may punish at
their discretion.
The written pledge: "No unpermit
ted aid given or received," which is
found on Stanford examination
blue-books, is more a reminder than
anything else; for the Honor Code is
applied to all papers, regardless of
pledge.
PENALIZED BY COUNCIL
Violations of the Honor Code
come before either the Men's or
Women's Council. During regular
quarters, when facilities permit, the
members of both these bodies are
students elected by students. The
summer-quarter Men's Council is
appointed by the Dean of Men, and
serves also in the capacity of spon
sor for the new students. Andy
Stojkovich, chairman; Jim Haugh,
and Don Ruggles constitute its mem
bership this summer.
The summer Women's Council,
appointed by spring quarter's retir
ing chairman, is composed of Vir
ginia Stevens, Nancy Meyer, Clare
Wagstaffe, Janet Bont, and Gloria
Zick.
Questions regarding the Honor
Code, and reports of students viola
tions should be made to these stu
dents or at the office of the Dean of
Men.
Lagunita Court was completed in
1934.

the petitions of 1,700 members of the
student body. Granted by the Uni
versity Academic Council, only
conditionally at first, the revolution
ary program has had a signal suc
cess, and is today considered by
Stanford men and women as one of
the highlights of the history of the
Farm.
Astounding as the prospect of
transferring the full responsibility
lor student conduct to the members
of the student body at first seemed,
the classes of 1921, and those that
have followed, quickly adopted
themselves to the Code; and it has
become an integral and highly ap
preciated factor of student life.
The student appeal for the ap
plication of the honor system was a
natural reaction from the intensive
and irritating "proctored" and
teacher - controlled examinations
given in countless high schools and
colleges. From examinations in
which a contest-element had been
introduced by continual efforts of
students to "beat" the teacher by
cheating, Stanford undergraduates
hoped for a more intelligent system.
USED IN LAW SCHOOL
They found it in a system which
had been devised for the Stanford
law school some years previous, and
used with recognized success among
graduate students. Its primary ele
ments are still present in our Stan
ford Honor Code of 1940.
It was this hope of the students of
1921 that enables today's undergrad
uates to leave their exams for a
moment of relaxation or a smoke off
the Quad, that leaves the professor
free to remain in his office and an
swer the questions of students
puzzled by exam questions, that en
ables Accounting students to take
thier balance-sheets to the library,
and English professors to return
compositions to tyro-writers.
NO PROCTORS
Students who come to Stanford
from other institutions used to the
ever-present proctor patrolling the
aisles, are usually so refreshed by
freedom offered here that they feel
almost compensated for having to
take examinations at all.
Although perhaps most severely
tested in the student examination,
the Honor Code is by no means lim
ited to this phase of Stanford life.
It is almost all-inclusive and just as
broad as Stanford's first president,
Dr. David Starr Jordan's require
ments when he said:
"Students are expected to show, I
both within and without the Univer
sity, such respect for order, moral
ity, honor, and the rights of others,
as is demanded of good citizens."
OTHER VIOLATIONS
Disregarding the library rules, all 1
forms of plagiarism, the use of an
other person's composition, even
with his permission, handing iden
tical material in for two courses, all

these are specific violations of the
Code. But "conduct unbecoming a
Stanford man or woman" is an addi
tional violation which the Men's and
Women's Councils may punish at
their discretion.
The written pledge: "No unpermit
ted aid given or received," which is
found on Stanford examination
blue-books, is more a reminder than
anything else; for the Honor Code is
applied to all papers, regardless of
pledge.
PENALIZED BY COUNCIL
Violations of the Honor Code
come before either the Men's or
Women's Council. During regular
quarters, when facilities permit, the
members of both these bodies are
students elected by students. The
summer-quarter Men's Council is
appointed by the Dean of Men, and
serves also in the capacity of spon
sor for the new students. Andy
Stojkovich, chairman; Jim Haugh,
and Don Ruggles constitute its mem
bership this summer.
The summer Women's Council,
appointed by spring quarter's retir
ing chairman, is composed of Vir
ginia Stevens, Nancy Meyer, Clare
Wagstaffe, Janet Bont, and Gloria
Zick.
Questions regarding the Honor
Code, and reports of students viola
tions should be made to these stu
dents or at the office of the Dean of
Men.
Lagunita Court was completed in
1934.
Although the Stanford Honor Code is a standard applying to all phases
of student life, it applies most practically to the taking of examinations.
Because of the approach of final exams, and the fact that many summer
quarter students are not familiar with the Honor Code, The Stanford Daily
is co-operating with Men's and Women's Councils, whose duties include
the inculcation of the Honor Code, ♦ —

themselves to the Code; and it has
become an integral and highly ap
preciated factor of student life.
The student appeal for the ap
plication of the honor system was a
natural reaction from the intensive
and irritating "proctored" and
teacher - controlled examinations
given in countless high schools and
colleges. From examinations in
which a contest-element had been
introduced by continual efforts of
students to "beat" the teacher by
cheating, Stanford undergraduates
hoped for a more intelligent system.
USED IN LAW SCHOOL
They found it in a system which
had been devised for the Stanford
law school some years previous, and
used with recognized success among
graduate students. Its primary ele
ments are still present in our Stan
ford Honor Code of 1940.
It was this hope of the students of
1921 that enables today's undergrad
uates to leave their exams for a
moment of relaxation or a smoke off
the Quad, that leaves the professor
free to remain in his office and an
swer the questions of students
puzzled by exam questions, that en
ables Accounting students to take
thier balance-sheets to the library,
and English professors to return
compositions to tyro-writers.
NO PROCTORS
Students who come to Stanford
from other institutions used to the
ever-present proctor patrolling the
aisles, are usually so refreshed by
freedom offered here that they feel
almost compensated for having to
take examinations at all.
Although perhaps most severely
tested in the student examination,
the Honor Code is by no means lim
ited to this phase of Stanford life.
It is almost all-inclusive and just as
broad as Stanford's first president,
Dr. David Starr Jordan's require
ments when he said:
"Students are expected to show, I
both within and without the Univer
sity, such respect for order, moral
ity, honor, and the rights of others,
as is demanded of good citizens."
OTHER VIOLATIONS
Disregarding the library rules, all 1
forms of plagiarism, the use of an
other person's composition, even
with his permission, handing iden
tical material in for two courses, all

these are specific violations of the
Code. But "conduct unbecoming a
Stanford man or woman" is an addi
tional violation which the Men's and
Women's Councils may punish at
their discretion.
The written pledge: "No unpermit
ted aid given or received," which is
found on Stanford examination
blue-books, is more a reminder than
anything else; for the Honor Code is
applied to all papers, regardless of
pledge.
PENALIZED BY COUNCIL
Violations of the Honor Code
come before either the Men's or
Women's Council. During regular
quarters, when facilities permit, the
members of both these bodies are
students elected by students. The
summer-quarter Men's Council is
appointed by the Dean of Men, and
serves also in the capacity of spon
sor for the new students. Andy
Stojkovich, chairman; Jim Haugh,
and Don Ruggles constitute its mem
bership this summer.
The summer Women's Council,
appointed by spring quarter's retir
ing chairman, is composed of Vir
ginia Stevens, Nancy Meyer, Clare
Wagstaffe, Janet Bont, and Gloria
Zick.
Questions regarding the Honor
Code, and reports of students viola
tions should be made to these stu
dents or at the office of the Dean of
Men.
Lagunita Court was completed in
1934.
Although the Stanford Honor Code is a standard applying to all phases
of student life, it applies most practically to the taking of examinations.
Because of the approach of final exams, and the fact that many summer
quarter students are not familiar with the Honor Code, The Stanford Daily
is co-operating with Men's and Women's Councils, whose duties include
the inculcation of the Honor Code, ♦ —

subject.—Editors' Note
Stanford's now-famous Honor
Code was adopted 19 years ago on
the petitions of 1,700 members of the
student body. Granted by the Uni
versity Academic Council, only
conditionally at first, the revolution
ary program has had a signal suc
cess, and is today considered by
Stanford men and women as one of
the highlights of the history of the
Farm.
Astounding as the prospect of
transferring the full responsibility
lor student conduct to the members
of the student body at first seemed,
the classes of 1921, and those that
have followed, quickly adopted
themselves to the Code; and it has
