# Softball Champ Playoffs Due
## Agonists, Sparducks Top Starring Terms 
### 
With the league play at an end,
the playoffs will start today with
Greer's Greasers meeting the Ac
cordions on Field 5. The Slavedriv
ers will tangle with the Prunepickers
on Field 2.
The winner of the Driver-Picker
tilt will come up against the rough
and tumble Agonists on Field 2.
The Greaser-Folder brawl winner
will meet the Sparducks on Field 5.
These games will be played on Wed
nesday and the winner of these ses
sions will mess it up Thursday for
the "champeenship" on Field 5.
Last week the Socialists dropped
out of the running, giving the New
Dealers a free ride with a brass
I'ing, score 1-0.
Greer's Greasers were busy hunt
ing around in the bushes as a last
attempt to find the Foreign Legion,
which of course was futile, score 1-0.
The Accordions pounded out a win
over the Prunepickers to the tune
of 5 to 2. Nothing spectacular oc
curred but through a gradual proc
ess of evolution, hampered slightly
by brililant playing on the part of
Chick Franich, the push and pull
men worked up the score.
The Agonists pounded themselves
out for a count of 7 to 3 over the
Outlaws. As usual, Calvelli showed
up among the rougher chums of the
muscle men, aided and abetted by
Alustiza.
The Slavedrivers showed up as a
power house rolling toward the Head
Cripple title by rattling up 19 runs
to the hapless Red Gappers measly
leetle ol' 3. A couple of costly er

rors on the part of the Gappers help
ed the Slavers to pile up the tally.
Beautiful hitting with plenty of
power was very much in evidence
every time the Faculty aggregation
came to the plate and their fancy
fielding nipped the Gappers' runs
before they could be dangerous.
The Sparducks went on their
merry way toward higher laurels
with Bob Berry hurling a snappy
game of ball.. The Toro Bulls didn't
have a chance throughout the game
and the tally turned up at 16 to 4.
Ned Johns, glued to first base, han
dled a couple of hot ones which
looked for a while like they were
going to be errors but the guy just
couldn't miss and so hats of? to a
swell bunch of ball players.
Friday, the Agonists and the Slave
drivers went out for a little exercise
and had a bit of a game that turned
out to be interesting. Right off the
bat, the Agonist ran up a 5-run
count for a first inning "rally." The
Slavers didn't play such sharp ball
and the score came out 6 to 1.
Eight hundred Stanford students
went to war in 1917, and Encina Hall
became an army barracks.

out to be interesting. Right off the
bat, the Agonist ran up a 5-run

With the league play at an end,
the playoffs will start today with
Greer's Greasers meeting the Ac
cordions on Field 5. The Slavedriv
ers will tangle with the Prunepickers
on Field 2.
The winner of the Driver-Picker
tilt will come up against the rough
and tumble Agonists on Field 2.
The Greaser-Folder brawl winner
will meet the Sparducks on Field 5.
These games will be played on Wed
nesday and the winner of these ses
sions will mess it up Thursday for
the "champeenship" on Field 5.
Last week the Socialists dropped
out of the running, giving the New
Dealers a free ride with a brass
I'ing, score 1-0.
Greer's Greasers were busy hunt
ing around in the bushes as a last
attempt to find the Foreign Legion,
which of course was futile, score 1-0.
The Accordions pounded out a win
over the Prunepickers to the tune
of 5 to 2. Nothing spectacular oc
curred but through a gradual proc
ess of evolution, hampered slightly
by brililant playing on the part of
Chick Franich, the push and pull
men worked up the score.
The Agonists pounded themselves
out for a count of 7 to 3 over the
Outlaws. As usual, Calvelli showed
up among the rougher chums of the
muscle men, aided and abetted by
Alustiza.
The Slavedrivers showed up as a
power house rolling toward the Head
Cripple title by rattling up 19 runs
to the hapless Red Gappers measly
leetle ol' 3. A couple of costly er

rors on the part of the Gappers help
ed the Slavers to pile up the tally.
Beautiful hitting with plenty of
power was very much in evidence
every time the Faculty aggregation
came to the plate and their fancy
fielding nipped the Gappers' runs
before they could be dangerous.
The Sparducks went on their
merry way toward higher laurels
with Bob Berry hurling a snappy
game of ball.. The Toro Bulls didn't
have a chance throughout the game
and the tally turned up at 16 to 4.
Ned Johns, glued to first base, han
dled a couple of hot ones which
looked for a while like they were
going to be errors but the guy just
couldn't miss and so hats of? to a
swell bunch of ball players.
