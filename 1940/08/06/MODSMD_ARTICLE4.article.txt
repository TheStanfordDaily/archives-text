# Gold Not 'Idle,' Machlup Says
## Stanford Economist To Speak on Radio 
### 
That our twenty billion-dollar
horde of monetary gold is "idle" and
should be "put to work" is a popu
lar misconception, Dr. Fritz Mach
lup, acting professor of economics,
said yesterday.
Dr. Machlup, who will speak on
"Our Buried Gold" in the Stanford
University—On the Air program over
Station KPO Wednesday evening at
9:30 o'clock, pointed out that the
buried gold is working "function
ally" just as much as is any other
asset against which money has been
issued.
The money which was created by
the purchase of the gold circulates
just as much as its owners care to
make it circulate, he said.
In Dr. Machlup's opinion, plans for
putting our "idle" gold to work are
usually plans for the inflationary
creation of more money or credit,
and should be avoided.
Dr. Machlup, who has been on the
faculty of the University of Buffalo
since 1935, was a lecturer in the
Volkhochschule in Vienna from
1929 to 1933. He was a Rockefeller
Research fellow from 1933 to 1935.
