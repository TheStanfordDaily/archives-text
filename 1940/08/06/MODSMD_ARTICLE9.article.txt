# Stanford Scribe Hitch-hikes Chicagoward—Backwards
## 
### 
Better not ask a certain Daily 4
staff member and his friend, Joe,
from U.C.L.A. how to hitch-hike.
They look smart enough at first
glance, but don't ask their advice if
you plan to thumb it to Chicago.
They'd probably tell you to get
your friend Dwight Hutchinson to
drive you up to Oakland to the head
of Highway 40 and bring your car
back to the campus for you.
FIRST RIDE EASY
"Getting your first ride is a lead
pipe cinch," they'd probably tell
you. "Just stand there with your
thumb up, and you may get as far
as Sacramento first crack."
Sounds okay so far, but just wait
until you hear some more of their
good ideas.
"No use lugging all your money
along and risk getting held up,"
they'd be apt to suggest. "Why not
put all you can spare into a couple
of money orders? Mail one to
Omaha and the other to Chicago,
general delivery. Then you can pick

►them up when you get there, see."
If you go ahead and ask their ad
vice in spite of this warning, here's
what is likely to happen:
You'll get rides easy enough to
Elko, Nevada.
You'll stand for an hour in the hot
sun at Elko waiting for a ride that
doesn't come.
NEVADA IS WATERLOO
A man will say, "Boy, you'll never
catch a ride across Nevada."
You'll wait another five hours in
the hot sun, but no ride.
Then you'll cross the road and try
thumbing the other way, back
toward Stanford.
Eventually you'll get a ride; after
a while you'll get back to the cam
pus.
You'll find your friend Hutch, get
your car from him. and start driv
ing toward Omaha and Chicago to
pick up your money orders.
Don't say you weren't warned.
Those boys are a couple of screw
balls, that's all.

A man will say, "Boy, you'll never
catch a ride across Nevada."
You'll wait another five hours in
the hot sun, but no ride.
Then you'll cross the road and try
thumbing the other way, back
toward Stanford.
Eventually you'll get a ride; after
a while you'll get back to the cam
pus.
You'll find your friend Hutch, get
your car from him. and start driv
ing toward Omaha and Chicago to
pick up your money orders.
Don't say you weren't warned.
Those boys are a couple of screw
balls, that's all.
Better not ask a certain Daily 4
staff member and his friend, Joe,
from U.C.L.A. how to hitch-hike.
They look smart enough at first
glance, but don't ask their advice if
you plan to thumb it to Chicago.
They'd probably tell you to get
your friend Dwight Hutchinson to
drive you up to Oakland to the head
of Highway 40 and bring your car
back to the campus for you.
FIRST RIDE EASY
"Getting your first ride is a lead
pipe cinch," they'd probably tell
you. "Just stand there with your
thumb up, and you may get as far
as Sacramento first crack."
Sounds okay so far, but just wait
until you hear some more of their
good ideas.
"No use lugging all your money
along and risk getting held up,"
they'd be apt to suggest. "Why not
put all you can spare into a couple
of money orders? Mail one to
Omaha and the other to Chicago,
general delivery. Then you can pick

►them up when you get there, see."
If you go ahead and ask their ad
vice in spite of this warning, here's
what is likely to happen:
You'll get rides easy enough to
Elko, Nevada.
You'll stand for an hour in the hot
sun at Elko waiting for a ride that
doesn't come.
NEVADA IS WATERLOO
