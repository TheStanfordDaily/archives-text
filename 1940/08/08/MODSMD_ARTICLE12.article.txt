# U.S. Will Not Lose If Gold Isn't Money
## Dr. Machlup Talks On 'Our Buried Gold' 
### 
If the other nations abandon gold
as an international medium of ex
change the United States will not
suffer an actual loss of wealth or
income, Dr. Fritz Machlup, acting
professor of economics, declared
last night in a radio address.
Dr. Machlup spoke on "Our Bur
ied Gold" on the Stanford Univer
sity—On the Air program over Sta
tion KPO. He spoke in part, as fol
lows:
"What are the dangers or disad
vantages of the gold imports? That
we exchange our good American
products for which we might have
some use for the gold for which we
have no use, is emphasized as the
chief disadvantage.
"And it is really the most serious
point of all, provided that we would
have actually used for something
else the productive resources, labor
before all, which have produced the
things we have exported.
GOLD CREATES EMPLOYMENT

were used for the production of our
export goods probably would have
been unemployed otherwise. In this
case the exports, and indirectly our
gold imports which have enabled

have created employment in the
United States.
"If somebody objects that we
might have created the same employ

own people rather than for foreign
nations, one must admit that this
might be possible, but that if we
knew how to do it we would not
have nine or ten millions of unem
ployed.
"We are told that we shall one day
be faced with a loss of all or most
of the 20, or perhaps it will then be
30, billion dollars when we discover
that the world had definitely aban
doned gold as an international me

NAZIS SAY GOLD LOST
"Germany has already announced
that this is her intention. Assumed
(but not granted) that it were so,
would our nation suffer an actual
loss of wealth or income? No.
"It would make no difference to
our national income; and wealth is
only what contributes to income.
Any loss from buying valueless
things occurs while we buy them,
not when we discover that they are
