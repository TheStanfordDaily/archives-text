# U.S. Will Not Lose If Gold Isn't Money
## Dr. Machlup Talks On 'Our Buried Gold' 
### 
If the other nations abandon gold
as an international medium of ex
change the United States will not
suffer an actual loss of wealth or
income, Dr. Fritz Machlup, acting
professor of economics, declared
last night in a radio address.
Dr. Machlup spoke on "Our Bur
ied Gold" on the Stanford Univer
sity—On the Air program over Sta
tion KPO. He spoke in part, as fol
lows:
"What are the dangers or disad
vantages of the gold imports? That
we exchange our good American
products for which we might have
some use for the gold for which we
have no use, is emphasized as the
chief disadvantage.
"And it is really the most serious
point of all, provided that we would
have actually used for something
else the productive resources, labor
before all, which have produced the
things we have exported.
GOLD CREATES EMPLOYMENT
"This is, however, open to doubt.
The labor and the material which
were used for the production of our
export goods probably would have
been unemployed otherwise. In this
case the exports, and indirectly our
gold imports which have enabled
loreign nations to buy our exports,
have created employment in the
United States.
"If somebody objects that we
might have created the same employ
ment by producing goods for our
own people rather than for foreign
nations, one must admit that this
might be possible, but that if we
knew how to do it we would not
have nine or ten millions of unem
ployed.
"We are told that we shall one day
be faced with a loss of all or most
of the 20, or perhaps it will then be
30, billion dollars when we discover
that the world had definitely aban
doned gold as an international me
dium of exchange.
NAZIS SAY GOLD LOST
"Germany has already announced
that this is her intention. Assumed
(but not granted) that it were so,
would our nation suffer an actual
loss of wealth or income? No.
"It would make no difference to
our national income; and wealth is
only what contributes to income.
Any loss from buying valueless
things occurs while we buy them,
not when we discover that they are
no good; and whether or not we lose
in buying the gold depends, again,
on whether or not we have a better
use for the labor that produces our
exports.
"But the assumption that gold
would not be accepted by other na
tions can hardly be granted. As long
as other nations are sure that we
would continue to accept gold they
would be glad to take gold, too.
THEY WILL TAKE GOLD'
"They will, when we wish to buy
more from them, take our gold in
exchange, because they will know
that we shall take the gold, when
we sell more to them. And just this
is the purpose gold has served in the
past.
"Why does Germany want to do
foreign trade without the use of
gold? Let me answer by an analogy.
Card players may hold their account
either with the use of chips (and
this analogy points to gold as ex
change medium) or simply by writ
ing the scores and balances on pieces
of paper.
"Somebody who has used up all
his chips may want to suggest that
the game be continued and his debts
be merely noted down. This is a
good way of forcing the partners to
extend credit without making it too
explicit.
"The greatest danger of our enor
mous gold stock arises from the con
stant temptation to base on the gold
an inflationary expansion of cur
rency or credit.
INFLATION MUST NOT COME
"This inflation must be prevented
and it can be prevented by conserva
tive and modern techniques of mone
tary control. We must not succumb
to the temptation and must table the
wild schemes proposing a better
utilization (in fact, inflationary
utilization) of our buried gold.
"How can we keep out or reduce a
further gold afflux? I shall mention

some of the proposed measures and
add the valid objections.
"Proposal: Refuse to buy gold.
"Objection: The dollar would rise
high and fluctuate wildly on foreign
markets, daily fluctuations in the
prices of our imported and exported
goods would make for unhealthy
business conditions.
"Proposal: Make America just as
unsafe for capital as the rest of the
world is, then nobody would want
to send or leave us his gold. This
proposal is, I hope, only a joke, un
less one detects implied in it the
ideas of various 'isms.'
"I come to the last question. What
could our buried gold be used for?
CERTIFICATES VS. BONDS
"Against the buried gold, at least
18 billion dollars of it, gold certifi
cates were issued and are held by
the Federal Reserve banks out of its
burial place, the gold certificates
would have to be honored. The gov
ernment could perhaps release the
gold by replacing the gold certifi
cated by some sort of a government
bond.
"The final result ot such an op
eration would be that the govern
ment debt to private savers, insur
ance companies, savings banks, and
commerical banks would be trans
formed into a government debt to
the Reserve banks, and this might
have catastrophic consequences.
"The government might save some
interest payments on its dfebt but
would have on its hands the prob
lem of a collapsing banking sys
tem.
"The proposal to permit circula
tion of gold coins would be quite
harmless.
COINAGE INSUFFICIENT
"But since our total circulation of
10 and 20-dollar notes amounts to
some three billion dollars only, and
probably not very many people
would care to carry gold coins
rather than paper bills, the gold cir
culation proposal does not seem to
be very consequential.
"Let me dispel, in conclusion, our
popular misconception. People com
plain that our gold is 'idle' and
should be 'put to work.' Now, to be
sure, physically the gold is idle and

lies lazily in its safe places.
"But functionally it is working no
less than any other asset works
against which money has been is
sued. When the gold was bought,
money was created, chiefly in the
form of check-book money.
"This money still exists and it cir
culates as much as its owners make
it circulate, that is to say, as much
as American individuals and busi
ness firms make use of the money
funds which they hold.
"Plans for putting our 'idle' gold
to work are usually nothing else but
plans for the inflationary creation of
more money and credit. Let us be
ware of such plans to exhume our
buried gold."

"But since our total circulation of
10 and 20-dollar notes amounts to
some three billion dollars only, and
probably not very many people
would care to carry gold coins
rather than paper bills, the gold cir

If the other nations abandon gold
as an international medium of ex
change the United States will not
suffer an actual loss of wealth or
income, Dr. Fritz Machlup, acting
professor of economics, declared
last night in a radio address.
Dr. Machlup spoke on "Our Bur
ied Gold" on the Stanford Univer
sity—On the Air program over Sta
tion KPO. He spoke in part, as fol
lows:
"What are the dangers or disad
vantages of the gold imports? That
we exchange our good American
products for which we might have
some use for the gold for which we
have no use, is emphasized as the
chief disadvantage.
"And it is really the most serious
point of all, provided that we would
have actually used for something
else the productive resources, labor
before all, which have produced the
things we have exported.
GOLD CREATES EMPLOYMENT
"This is, however, open to doubt.
The labor and the material which
were used for the production of our
export goods probably would have
been unemployed otherwise. In this
case the exports, and indirectly our
gold imports which have enabled
loreign nations to buy our exports,
have created employment in the
United States.
"If somebody objects that we
might have created the same employ
ment by producing goods for our
own people rather than for foreign
nations, one must admit that this
might be possible, but that if we
knew how to do it we would not
have nine or ten millions of unem
ployed.
"We are told that we shall one day
be faced with a loss of all or most
of the 20, or perhaps it will then be
30, billion dollars when we discover
that the world had definitely aban
doned gold as an international me
dium of exchange.
NAZIS SAY GOLD LOST
"Germany has already announced
that this is her intention. Assumed
(but not granted) that it were so,
would our nation suffer an actual
loss of wealth or income? No.
"It would make no difference to
our national income; and wealth is
only what contributes to income.
Any loss from buying valueless
things occurs while we buy them,
not when we discover that they are
no good; and whether or not we lose
in buying the gold depends, again,
on whether or not we have a better
use for the labor that produces our
exports.
"But the assumption that gold
would not be accepted by other na
tions can hardly be granted. As long
as other nations are sure that we
would continue to accept gold they
would be glad to take gold, too.
THEY WILL TAKE GOLD'
"They will, when we wish to buy
more from them, take our gold in
exchange, because they will know
that we shall take the gold, when
we sell more to them. And just this
is the purpose gold has served in the
past.
"Why does Germany want to do
foreign trade without the use of
gold? Let me answer by an analogy.
Card players may hold their account
either with the use of chips (and
this analogy points to gold as ex
change medium) or simply by writ
ing the scores and balances on pieces
of paper.
"Somebody who has used up all
his chips may want to suggest that
the game be continued and his debts
be merely noted down. This is a
good way of forcing the partners to
extend credit without making it too
explicit.
"The greatest danger of our enor
mous gold stock arises from the con
stant temptation to base on the gold
an inflationary expansion of cur
rency or credit.
INFLATION MUST NOT COME
"This inflation must be prevented
and it can be prevented by conserva
tive and modern techniques of mone
tary control. We must not succumb
to the temptation and must table the
wild schemes proposing a better
utilization (in fact, inflationary
utilization) of our buried gold.
"How can we keep out or reduce a
further gold afflux? I shall mention

some of the proposed measures and
add the valid objections.
"Proposal: Refuse to buy gold.
"Objection: The dollar would rise
high and fluctuate wildly on foreign
markets, daily fluctuations in the
prices of our imported and exported
goods would make for unhealthy
business conditions.
"Proposal: Make America just as
unsafe for capital as the rest of the
world is, then nobody would want
to send or leave us his gold. This
proposal is, I hope, only a joke, un
less one detects implied in it the
ideas of various 'isms.'
"I come to the last question. What
could our buried gold be used for?
CERTIFICATES VS. BONDS
"Against the buried gold, at least
18 billion dollars of it, gold certifi
cates were issued and are held by
the Federal Reserve banks out of its
burial place, the gold certificates
would have to be honored. The gov
ernment could perhaps release the
gold by replacing the gold certifi
cated by some sort of a government
bond.
"The final result ot such an op
eration would be that the govern
ment debt to private savers, insur
ance companies, savings banks, and
commerical banks would be trans
formed into a government debt to
the Reserve banks, and this might
have catastrophic consequences.

"I come to the last question. What
could our buried gold be used for?
CERTIFICATES VS. BONDS
"Against the buried gold, at least
18 billion dollars of it, gold certifi
cates were issued and are held by
the Federal Reserve banks out of its
burial place, the gold certificates
would have to be honored. The gov
ernment could perhaps release the
gold by replacing the gold certifi
cated by some sort of a government
bond.
"The final result ot such an op
eration would be that the govern
ment debt to private savers, insur
ance companies, savings banks, and
commerical banks would be trans
formed into a government debt to
the Reserve banks, and this might
have catastrophic consequences.
"The government might save some
interest payments on its dfebt but
would have on its hands the prob
lem of a collapsing banking sys
tem.
"The proposal to permit circula
tion of gold coins would be quite
harmless.
COINAGE INSUFFICIENT
"But since our total circulation of
10 and 20-dollar notes amounts to
some three billion dollars only, and
probably not very many people
would care to carry gold coins
rather than paper bills, the gold cir
culation proposal does not seem to
be very consequential.
"Let me dispel, in conclusion, our
popular misconception. People com
plain that our gold is 'idle' and
should be 'put to work.' Now, to be
sure, physically the gold is idle and

lies lazily in its safe places.
"But functionally it is working no
less than any other asset works
against which money has been is
sued. When the gold was bought,
money was created, chiefly in the
form of check-book money.
"This money still exists and it cir
culates as much as its owners make
it circulate, that is to say, as much
as American individuals and busi
ness firms make use of the money
funds which they hold.
"Plans for putting our 'idle' gold
to work are usually nothing else but
plans for the inflationary creation of
more money and credit. Let us be
ware of such plans to exhume our
buried gold."
If the other nations abandon gold
as an international medium of ex
change the United States will not
suffer an actual loss of wealth or
income, Dr. Fritz Machlup, acting
professor of economics, declared
last night in a radio address.
Dr. Machlup spoke on "Our Bur
ied Gold" on the Stanford Univer
sity—On the Air program over Sta
tion KPO. He spoke in part, as fol
lows:
"What are the dangers or disad
vantages of the gold imports? That
we exchange our good American
products for which we might have
some use for the gold for which we
have no use, is emphasized as the
chief disadvantage.
"And it is really the most serious
point of all, provided that we would
have actually used for something
else the productive resources, labor
before all, which have produced the
things we have exported.
GOLD CREATES EMPLOYMENT
"This is, however, open to doubt.
The labor and the material which
were used for the production of our
export goods probably would have
been unemployed otherwise. In this
case the exports, and indirectly our
gold imports which have enabled
loreign nations to buy our exports,
have created employment in the
United States.
"If somebody objects that we
might have created the same employ
ment by producing goods for our
own people rather than for foreign
nations, one must admit that this
might be possible, but that if we
knew how to do it we would not
have nine or ten millions of unem
ployed.
"We are told that we shall one day
be faced with a loss of all or most
of the 20, or perhaps it will then be
30, billion dollars when we discover
that the world had definitely aban
doned gold as an international me
dium of exchange.
NAZIS SAY GOLD LOST
"Germany has already announced
that this is her intention. Assumed
(but not granted) that it were so,
would our nation suffer an actual
loss of wealth or income? No.
"It would make no difference to
our national income; and wealth is
only what contributes to income.
Any loss from buying valueless
things occurs while we buy them,
not when we discover that they are
no good; and whether or not we lose
in buying the gold depends, again,
on whether or not we have a better
use for the labor that produces our
exports.
"But the assumption that gold
would not be accepted by other na
tions can hardly be granted. As long
as other nations are sure that we
would continue to accept gold they
would be glad to take gold, too.
THEY WILL TAKE GOLD'
"They will, when we wish to buy
more from them, take our gold in
exchange, because they will know
that we shall take the gold, when
we sell more to them. And just this
is the purpose gold has served in the
past.
"Why does Germany want to do
foreign trade without the use of
gold? Let me answer by an analogy.
Card players may hold their account
either with the use of chips (and
this analogy points to gold as ex
change medium) or simply by writ
ing the scores and balances on pieces
of paper.
"Somebody who has used up all
his chips may want to suggest that
the game be continued and his debts
be merely noted down. This is a
good way of forcing the partners to
extend credit without making it too
explicit.
"The greatest danger of our enor
mous gold stock arises from the con
stant temptation to base on the gold
an inflationary expansion of cur
rency or credit.
INFLATION MUST NOT COME
"This inflation must be prevented
and it can be prevented by conserva
tive and modern techniques of mone
tary control. We must not succumb
to the temptation and must table the
wild schemes proposing a better
utilization (in fact, inflationary
utilization) of our buried gold.
"How can we keep out or reduce a
further gold afflux? I shall mention

some of the proposed measures and
add the valid objections.
"Proposal: Refuse to buy gold.
"Objection: The dollar would rise
high and fluctuate wildly on foreign
markets, daily fluctuations in the
prices of our imported and exported
goods would make for unhealthy

this analogy points to gold as ex
change medium) or simply by writ
ing the scores and balances on pieces
of paper.
"Somebody who has used up all
his chips may want to suggest that
the game be continued and his debts
be merely noted down. This is a
good way of forcing the partners to
extend credit without making it too
explicit.
"The greatest danger of our enor
mous gold stock arises from the con
stant temptation to base on the gold
an inflationary expansion of cur
rency or credit.
INFLATION MUST NOT COME
"This inflation must be prevented
and it can be prevented by conserva
tive and modern techniques of mone
tary control. We must not succumb
to the temptation and must table the
wild schemes proposing a better
utilization (in fact, inflationary
utilization) of our buried gold.
"How can we keep out or reduce a
further gold afflux? I shall mention

some of the proposed measures and
add the valid objections.
"Proposal: Refuse to buy gold.
"Objection: The dollar would rise
high and fluctuate wildly on foreign
markets, daily fluctuations in the
prices of our imported and exported
goods would make for unhealthy
business conditions.
"Proposal: Make America just as
unsafe for capital as the rest of the
world is, then nobody would want
to send or leave us his gold. This
proposal is, I hope, only a joke, un
less one detects implied in it the
ideas of various 'isms.'
"I come to the last question. What
could our buried gold be used for?
CERTIFICATES VS. BONDS
"Against the buried gold, at least
18 billion dollars of it, gold certifi
cates were issued and are held by
the Federal Reserve banks out of its
burial place, the gold certificates
would have to be honored. The gov
ernment could perhaps release the
gold by replacing the gold certifi
cated by some sort of a government
bond.
"The final result ot such an op
eration would be that the govern
ment debt to private savers, insur
ance companies, savings banks, and
commerical banks would be trans
formed into a government debt to
the Reserve banks, and this might
have catastrophic consequences.
"The government might save some
interest payments on its dfebt but
would have on its hands the prob
lem of a collapsing banking sys
tem.
"The proposal to permit circula
tion of gold coins would be quite
harmless.
COINAGE INSUFFICIENT
"But since our total circulation of
10 and 20-dollar notes amounts to
some three billion dollars only, and
probably not very many people
would care to carry gold coins
rather than paper bills, the gold cir
culation proposal does not seem to
be very consequential.
"Let me dispel, in conclusion, our
popular misconception. People com
plain that our gold is 'idle' and
should be 'put to work.' Now, to be
sure, physically the gold is idle and

lies lazily in its safe places.
"But functionally it is working no
less than any other asset works
against which money has been is
sued. When the gold was bought,
money was created, chiefly in the
form of check-book money.
"This money still exists and it cir
culates as much as its owners make
it circulate, that is to say, as much
as American individuals and busi
ness firms make use of the money
funds which they hold.
"Plans for putting our 'idle' gold
to work are usually nothing else but
plans for the inflationary creation of
more money and credit. Let us be
ware of such plans to exhume our
buried gold."
If the other nations abandon gold
as an international medium of ex
change the United States will not
suffer an actual loss of wealth or
income, Dr. Fritz Machlup, acting
professor of economics, declared
last night in a radio address.
Dr. Machlup spoke on "Our Bur
ied Gold" on the Stanford Univer
sity—On the Air program over Sta
tion KPO. He spoke in part, as fol
lows:
"What are the dangers or disad
vantages of the gold imports? That
we exchange our good American
products for which we might have
some use for the gold for which we
have no use, is emphasized as the
chief disadvantage.
"And it is really the most serious
point of all, provided that we would
have actually used for something
else the productive resources, labor
before all, which have produced the
things we have exported.
GOLD CREATES EMPLOYMENT
"This is, however, open to doubt.
The labor and the material which
were used for the production of our
export goods probably would have
been unemployed otherwise. In this
case the exports, and indirectly our
gold imports which have enabled
loreign nations to buy our exports,
have created employment in the
United States.
"If somebody objects that we
might have created the same employ
ment by producing goods for our
own people rather than for foreign
nations, one must admit that this
might be possible, but that if we
knew how to do it we would not
have nine or ten millions of unem
ployed.
"We are told that we shall one day
be faced with a loss of all or most
of the 20, or perhaps it will then be
30, billion dollars when we discover
that the world had definitely aban
doned gold as an international me
dium of exchange.
NAZIS SAY GOLD LOST
"Germany has already announced
that this is her intention. Assumed
(but not granted) that it were so,
would our nation suffer an actual
loss of wealth or income? No.
"It would make no difference to
our national income; and wealth is
only what contributes to income.
Any loss from buying valueless
things occurs while we buy them,
not when we discover that they are
no good; and whether or not we lose
in buying the gold depends, again,
on whether or not we have a better
use for the labor that produces our
exports.
"But the assumption that gold
would not be accepted by other na
tions can hardly be granted. As long
as other nations are sure that we
would continue to accept gold they
would be glad to take gold, too.
THEY WILL TAKE GOLD'
"They will, when we wish to buy
more from them, take our gold in
exchange, because they will know
that we shall take the gold, when
we sell more to them. And just this
is the purpose gold has served in the
past.
"Why does Germany want to do
foreign trade without the use of
gold? Let me answer by an analogy.
