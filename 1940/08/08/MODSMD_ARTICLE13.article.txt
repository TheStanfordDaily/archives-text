# League Headquarters to Move To U.S., Says Stanford Woman
## 
### 
The nonpolitical sections of the League of Nations may soon move to
the United States, according to a Stanford senior whose father, Arthur
Sweetser, has been head of the information section for many years and
who is now in the United £tates trying to arrange headquarters for the

various sections. <
Adelaide Sweetser was born in
America, but her home was in Ge
neva from the time she was a year
old, and she went to school there for
12 years. She went to Sarah Law
rence College for two years, return
ing to Switzerland each summer, and
she came to Stanford last fall.
INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL
The International School, just out
side Geneva, was established for the
children of the secretariat of the
League. The two official languages
were French and English, with many
of the students speaking German
and Chinese.
Adelaide said there were 27 na
tionalities represented at the school,
and it was easy to trace changes in
international politics by the changes
in nationalities of the students. For
instance, when Japan seceeded from
the League of Nations the Japanese
students disappeared and many Chi
nese came to the school. During the
Spanish Civil War many young loy
alists came to Geneva.
LOYALISTS ESCAPE
Adelaide told of a vacation at Hen
day, France, during the Spanish
Civil War, when Generalissimo
Franco was in possession of the
Pyrenees. He had many loyalists im
prisoned at a fort just across the
river from Henday. The Sweetsers
actually saw some of the prisoners

swim across the river and escape
into France, pursued by the machine
gun bullets of the rebel guards.
In speaking of her friends in Eu
rope, Adelaide said that most of the
boys she knew had enlisted. "There
was very little patriotic spirit due to
a cynical hangover from the last
war," she said. "Only the German
boys seemed to feel that a war would
be beneficial and would add to the
greater glory of their country." The
German residents of Switzerland
were fearful that Hitler would reach
out and annex their territory, and
they did not want to be united to
the Reich."
MUNICH CRISIS
The last time Adelaide was in
Europe was during the Munich
crisis. Contrary to an American
conception of the situation, she said
that it was not at all exciting—just
horrible.
"There were frequent blackouts
in Geneva, and all the League ex
perts would talk about how many
people would be killed on the first
day of the war," she said.
Adelaide regretted that during
most of the time she was in Geneva
she was too young to fully appre
ciate the importance of the events
going on around her. She said the
League assemblies were very inter
esting.
GENEVA CONSERVATIVE
In describing Geneva, Adelaide
said that the native conservatism was
directly antithetical to the strange
ways of the international settlement
which came with the League of Na
tions. "The residents are all strict
Calvinists," she said, "and disap
prove of anyone who has not lived
in Geneva since 1500.
"No," said Adelaide, "European
schools are not any more strict than
American schools. But they empha
size memorizing specific facts,
rather than developing initiative and
personality." She pointed out that
European colleges are more special
ized than ours, as over there when
a student graduates from high
school he knows exactly what he is
going to do.
GUIDE AT FAIR
Adelaide spent a year supervising
the guides at the League of Nations
Pavilion at the New York World's
Fair. After that she came to Stan
ford, largely because she wanted to
see California and to get away from
rain and cold weather.
Asked about her plans for the fu
ture, Adelaide said, "Who can make
plans these days? As for going back
to Europe, that is out of the question
at present as the State Department
will not renew my passport."
LETTERS FROM EUROPE
Adelaide has received several let
ters from Europe lately, but all of
them were "either censored or did
n't say anything." Some of her
friends are coming over from Eng
land soon and she hopes to learn
the true state of affairs in Europe
from them. She said that outgoing
letters are always read, but post
cards are usually sent through un

censored, as the governments don't
think them worth bothering with.
Adelaide spent several vacations
in Italy, France, Austria, and Eng
land, and has spent some time
skiing in the Swiss Alps. She ended
the interview with the remark that
she wished she had seen more of
Europe, but she was very glad to be
in America.
The Cooper Medical College was
transferred to Stanford in 1908, and
this was the beginning of the pres
ent medical school.

plans these days? As for going back
to Europe, that is out of the question
at present as the State Department
will not renew my passport."
LETTERS FROM EUROPE
Adelaide has received several let
ters from Europe lately, but all of
them were "either censored or did
n't say anything." Some of her
friends are coming over from Eng
land soon and she hopes to learn
the true state of affairs in Europe
from them. She said that outgoing
letters are always read, but post
cards are usually sent through un

censored, as the governments don't
think them worth bothering with.
Adelaide spent several vacations
in Italy, France, Austria, and Eng
land, and has spent some time
skiing in the Swiss Alps. She ended
the interview with the remark that
she wished she had seen more of
Europe, but she was very glad to be
in America.
The Cooper Medical College was
transferred to Stanford in 1908, and
this was the beginning of the pres
ent medical school.
The nonpolitical sections of the League of Nations may soon move to
the United States, according to a Stanford senior whose father, Arthur
Sweetser, has been head of the information section for many years and
who is now in the United £tates trying to arrange headquarters for the

various sections. <
Adelaide Sweetser was born in
America, but her home was in Ge
neva from the time she was a year
old, and she went to school there for
12 years. She went to Sarah Law
rence College for two years, return
ing to Switzerland each summer, and
she came to Stanford last fall.
INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL
The International School, just out
side Geneva, was established for the
children of the secretariat of the
League. The two official languages
were French and English, with many
of the students speaking German
and Chinese.
Adelaide said there were 27 na
tionalities represented at the school,
and it was easy to trace changes in
international politics by the changes
in nationalities of the students. For
instance, when Japan seceeded from
the League of Nations the Japanese
students disappeared and many Chi
nese came to the school. During the
Spanish Civil War many young loy
alists came to Geneva.
LOYALISTS ESCAPE
Adelaide told of a vacation at Hen
day, France, during the Spanish
Civil War, when Generalissimo
Franco was in possession of the
Pyrenees. He had many loyalists im
prisoned at a fort just across the
river from Henday. The Sweetsers
actually saw some of the prisoners

swim across the river and escape
into France, pursued by the machine
gun bullets of the rebel guards.
In speaking of her friends in Eu
rope, Adelaide said that most of the
boys she knew had enlisted. "There
was very little patriotic spirit due to
a cynical hangover from the last
war," she said. "Only the German
boys seemed to feel that a war would
be beneficial and would add to the
greater glory of their country." The
German residents of Switzerland
were fearful that Hitler would reach
out and annex their territory, and
they did not want to be united to
the Reich."
MUNICH CRISIS
The last time Adelaide was in
Europe was during the Munich
crisis. Contrary to an American
conception of the situation, she said
that it was not at all exciting—just
horrible.
"There were frequent blackouts
in Geneva, and all the League ex
perts would talk about how many
people would be killed on the first
day of the war," she said.
Adelaide regretted that during
most of the time she was in Geneva
she was too young to fully appre
ciate the importance of the events
going on around her. She said the
League assemblies were very inter
esting.
GENEVA CONSERVATIVE
In describing Geneva, Adelaide
said that the native conservatism was
directly antithetical to the strange
ways of the international settlement
which came with the League of Na
tions. "The residents are all strict
Calvinists," she said, "and disap
prove of anyone who has not lived
in Geneva since 1500.
"No," said Adelaide, "European
schools are not any more strict than
American schools. But they empha
size memorizing specific facts,
rather than developing initiative and
personality." She pointed out that
European colleges are more special
ized than ours, as over there when
a student graduates from high
school he knows exactly what he is
going to do.
GUIDE AT FAIR
Adelaide spent a year supervising
the guides at the League of Nations
Pavilion at the New York World's
Fair. After that she came to Stan
ford, largely because she wanted to
see California and to get away from
rain and cold weather.
Asked about her plans for the fu
ture, Adelaide said, "Who can make
plans these days? As for going back
to Europe, that is out of the question
at present as the State Department
will not renew my passport."

said that the native conservatism was
directly antithetical to the strange
ways of the international settlement
which came with the League of Na
tions. "The residents are all strict
Calvinists," she said, "and disap
prove of anyone who has not lived
in Geneva since 1500.
"No," said Adelaide, "European
schools are not any more strict than
American schools. But they empha
size memorizing specific facts,
rather than developing initiative and
personality." She pointed out that
European colleges are more special
ized than ours, as over there when
a student graduates from high
school he knows exactly what he is
going to do.
GUIDE AT FAIR
Adelaide spent a year supervising
the guides at the League of Nations
Pavilion at the New York World's
Fair. After that she came to Stan
ford, largely because she wanted to
see California and to get away from
rain and cold weather.
Asked about her plans for the fu
ture, Adelaide said, "Who can make
plans these days? As for going back
to Europe, that is out of the question
at present as the State Department
will not renew my passport."
LETTERS FROM EUROPE
Adelaide has received several let
ters from Europe lately, but all of
them were "either censored or did
n't say anything." Some of her
friends are coming over from Eng
land soon and she hopes to learn
the true state of affairs in Europe
from them. She said that outgoing
letters are always read, but post
cards are usually sent through un

censored, as the governments don't
think them worth bothering with.
Adelaide spent several vacations
in Italy, France, Austria, and Eng
land, and has spent some time
skiing in the Swiss Alps. She ended
the interview with the remark that
she wished she had seen more of
Europe, but she was very glad to be
in America.
The Cooper Medical College was
transferred to Stanford in 1908, and
this was the beginning of the pres
ent medical school.
The nonpolitical sections of the League of Nations may soon move to
the United States, according to a Stanford senior whose father, Arthur
Sweetser, has been head of the information section for many years and
who is now in the United £tates trying to arrange headquarters for the

various sections. <
Adelaide Sweetser was born in
America, but her home was in Ge
neva from the time she was a year
old, and she went to school there for
12 years. She went to Sarah Law
rence College for two years, return
ing to Switzerland each summer, and
she came to Stanford last fall.
INTERNATIONAL SCHOOL
The International School, just out
side Geneva, was established for the
children of the secretariat of the
League. The two official languages
were French and English, with many
of the students speaking German
and Chinese.
Adelaide said there were 27 na
tionalities represented at the school,
and it was easy to trace changes in
international politics by the changes
in nationalities of the students. For
instance, when Japan seceeded from
the League of Nations the Japanese
students disappeared and many Chi
nese came to the school. During the
Spanish Civil War many young loy
alists came to Geneva.
LOYALISTS ESCAPE
Adelaide told of a vacation at Hen
day, France, during the Spanish
Civil War, when Generalissimo
Franco was in possession of the
Pyrenees. He had many loyalists im
prisoned at a fort just across the
river from Henday. The Sweetsers
actually saw some of the prisoners

swim across the river and escape
into France, pursued by the machine
gun bullets of the rebel guards.
In speaking of her friends in Eu
rope, Adelaide said that most of the
boys she knew had enlisted. "There
was very little patriotic spirit due to
a cynical hangover from the last
war," she said. "Only the German
boys seemed to feel that a war would
be beneficial and would add to the
greater glory of their country." The
German residents of Switzerland
were fearful that Hitler would reach
out and annex their territory, and
they did not want to be united to
the Reich."
MUNICH CRISIS
The last time Adelaide was in
Europe was during the Munich
crisis. Contrary to an American
conception of the situation, she said
that it was not at all exciting—just
horrible.
"There were frequent blackouts
in Geneva, and all the League ex
perts would talk about how many
people would be killed on the first
day of the war," she said.
Adelaide regretted that during
most of the time she was in Geneva
she was too young to fully appre
ciate the importance of the events
going on around her. She said the
League assemblies were very inter
esting.
