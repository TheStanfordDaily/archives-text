# Six Universities Will Mobilize
## Stanford Facilities To Be on Call 
### 
Stanford University is one of six
universities to announce mobiliza
tion of its resources in the national
emergency.
The California Institute of Tech
nology was one of the first major
scientific schools to go into action.
Shortly after Hitler began his
bliztkrieg in May it formed a de
fense council, under the chairman
ship of Dr. Richard C. Tolman, who
has since been called to Washington
to be a member of the National De
fense Research Committee.
Harvard is put in contact with de
fense research by the fact that
President James B. Conant is on the
committee. Massachusetts Institute
of Technology is similarly repre
sented by President Karl T. Comp
ton.
FACILITIES MARSHALED
Within the last few days Stanford,
Princeton and Chicago Universities
have organized defense committees
or councils.
President Harold W. Dodds of
Princeton announced that "the whole
organization of the Unversity, men,
facilities and equipment, are again
at the disposal of the government as
it may require them." Princeton's
scientific research facilities will be
marshaled under guidance of Dean
Luther P. Eisengart of the graduate
school and Dean Kenneth H. Condit
of the School of Engineering.
At Stanford University President
Ray Lyman Wilbur has appointed a
National Emergency Committee, un
der the chairmanship of Dean Sam
uel B. Morris of the School of Engi
neering. A questionnaire has been
sent to the 1,283 teaching and ad
ministrative officers of the Univer
sity asking: "When and if the gov
ernment enlists every one on a war
basis, in what type of research, in
vestigation or other civilian or mili
tary activity can you make the great
est contribution."
The University of Chicago coun
cil on national defense created by
President Robert Maynard Hutchins
will initiate preparations for co-op
eration in defense measures and
serve as a clearing house for all
calls by the government on mate
rial and human resources of the Uni
versity.
