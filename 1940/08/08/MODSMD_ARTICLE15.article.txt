# Duck, Agonists In Final Brawl
## Slavers, Folders Dumped in Semis 
### 
In the first of the play-off, the
action was simply amazing and
some of the spectators agreed that
at least one of the games was an
upset. This little game was the tilt
between Greer's Greasers and the
Accordions. After the start of the
game, it looked like a day for the
Greasers but a second-inning spurt
on the part of the Accordions gave
them a 4 to 1 lead.
Nothing else happened until the
fifth, when the Greasers came
through with a 4-run rally, too.
Then the Accordions, with the help

of an error, stretched their lead out
to 8 to 6 and held it there for the
rest of the game.
The Greasers boomed out 11 hits
to the Accordions 10 but to no avail.
Too much help from the sidelines
for the kiddies.
GAMES GOES NIP AND TUCK
The Slavedrivers looped the
Prunepickers to the tune of 10 to 6.
The game was nip and tuck all the
way through but here, too, errors
turned the tide of the game and the
faculty cohorts pounded over a
couple of runs in the fifth to put
the game on ice.
The Pickers' 11 hits didn't help
them very much because the Driv
ers made every one of theirs count
for a run.
In yesterday's game the Spar
ducks came out on top of a 7 to 1
count over the Accordions. After a
little umpire difficulty the Spar
ducks settled down to steady ball
walloping and run tallying.
K. Palmer, the hurler for the Ac
cordions, put up a good fight but he
just didn't have the support in the
outfield. The two little gals that help
out the Accordions had a couple of
tough breaks in fielding that allowed
the Ducks to trot in for the impos
ing tally.
LOVING CUP TO WINNER
The Agonists plastered the Slave
drivers to the same tune as the Ac
cordion-Duck tilt, 7 to 1. A quick
rally in the second inning accounted
for several tallies that put the game
in the well known bag. It was
Frankie Alustiza of football fame
who acted as clean-up man for the
rough and tumble boys.
From there, the Slavedrivers did
n't make any impression on the
Agonists and float way the expres
sion that most aptly described the
play for the rest of the exercise
period.
Today's game will be the final for
the League and the winner will get
the fur-lined loving cup with the
imposing title of Head Cripples of
the Wheel Chair League.
The Sparducks will meet the Ag
onists and it will be a plenty snappy
game. At 5 o'clock on the field over
by the Polo Field is the place, and
lots of support would be appre
ciated. Let's get out and root for
the best team.
