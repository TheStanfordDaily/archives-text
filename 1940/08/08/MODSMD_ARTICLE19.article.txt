Folks, if you return to Stanford
next quarter or next summer, you
won't find Miss Irene Craig at the
secretary's desk any more. Instead,
you will see Mrs. Rupert Willough
by. But it will be the same person.
Miss Craig and Mr. Willoughby, a
Stanford student, will be married at
the Palo Alto Congregational
Church Sept. 7 at 2 o'clock; and if
any of her acquaintances and friends
of the summer session are here at
that time she will be glad, she said,
to have them attend. Miss Craig is
now finishing her seventh year as
secretary to the School of Education.

Some day this column is going to
turn into a department for the re
porting of new books written by
members of the faculty of the School
of Education and about to be pub
lished. Already we have announced
Professor Roberts' new book, "Let's
Read" and Professor Kinney's whole
series of mathematics texts.
Now here's the newest addition to
the list: Dr. John Almack, professor
of education, is author of a new book
on narcotics, "Straight Thinking," to
be published Sept. 1 by the Pacific
Publishing Association of Mountain
View. It is for senior high school
and junior college students and is
the third in a series on this topic.
Others are "Facts First," for inter
mediate grade children t.nd "Clear
Case" for junior high students.
These books deal, Dr. Almack
said, with the harmful effects of
alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and
opium and its derivatives.

Granted a scholarship, Leif
Thorne-Thomsen, research fellow in
the Language Arts Investigation,
will leave late this month for Har
avrd University to work with Dr.
I. A. Richards, noted scholar in
language and semantics and author
of "The Meaning of Meaning." His
work will be in the problems of
teaching semantics and language.

ing and editing the material pro

A year ago this column reported
that Professor Holland Roberts fre
quently came bringing gifts of fruit
from his own garden, for his col
leagues in the School of Education.
Last Tuesday we said that this sum
mer he has shifted to flowers. But
Wednesday morning, 10, a basket of
peaches on his desk from his own
peach trees.

Summer school about to end and
most graduate students will have a
week or ten days' time before re
turning to their respective jobs out
on the educational firing line. School
of Education faculty members will
have a little more time, before the
opening of the fall quarter. Last
summer they spent that time doing
various things from research work
to hiking trips in the mountains.
About next week this column may
break down and give some specific
facts about what they will do this
time, stating names and giving ex
act data; like, for instance, Dean
Kefauver and his family may go to
their cabin in the Sierras, etc.

An at home for Education faculty
and students, by Dean and Mrs. Ke
fauver Sunday, 4 to 6 o'clock, 678
