# Democracy Is Revolutionary'
## Is Not Just Status Quo Defenseâ€”Quillen 
### 
Democracy is not just a defense
of the status quo, Professor I. L.
Quillen told members of the Educa
tion Club Tuesday.
"If we say that democracy is a
defense of the status quo, we are
condemning democracy, for democ
racy is itself revolutionary," he as
serted. "Democracy is a form of in
stitutionalized revolution that needs
at the present time a dynamic pro
gram to maintain itself and to chal
lenge the emotionalism of Commun
ism, Fascism, and Naziism."
The teacher is an important ele
ment in a positive program of edu
cation for the maintenance of Ameri
can democracy.
"In our schools," he said, "we must
put emphasis on the meaning of
democracy and make school a place
where democracy is lived."
SCHOOLS FOSTER LEADERSHIP
Professor Quillen stated that one
of the greatest lacks of the American
people is the ability to think effec
tively about social problems. He
suggested that children be trained
in social skills, and that the schools
foster a new conception of leader
ship.
"We must stress the pattern of
leadership," Dr. Quillen said. "An
individual must assume the respon
sibility of leadership when he has
most to contribute to the group;
when he cannot contribute, he must
follow."
Dr. Quillen said schools should be
more concerned with the presenta
tion of various points of view on con
troversial subjects. Otherwise, he

continued, American youth will be
come easy prey to outside influences
through the fact that they fail to
recognize propaganda.
ACHIEVE DEMOCRATIC VALUES
"We have the responsibility to
make the school a more integral
part of the community," said Pro
fessor Quillen. "We must strive to
find areas of agreement between the
various groups in a community if we
want to achieve democratic values."
Professor Quillen declared that a
teacher should be a living example
of democracy, which he defined as
"a recognition of the fact that in all
individuals there are human possi
bilities, no matter how low that per
son is."
"This is not the first challenge to
democracy, nor the most serious,"
said Professor Quillen. "We need
faith in democracy, and the courage
to believe that it promises a better
life for all, regardless of race, cul
ture, or economic circumstance."

"This is not the first challenge to
democracy, nor the most serious,"
said Professor Quillen. "We need
faith in democracy, and the courage
to believe that it promises a better
life for all, regardless of race, cul
ture, or economic circumstance."
Democracy is not just a defense
of the status quo, Professor I. L.
Quillen told members of the Educa
tion Club Tuesday.
"If we say that democracy is a
defense of the status quo, we are
condemning democracy, for democ
racy is itself revolutionary," he as
serted. "Democracy is a form of in
stitutionalized revolution that needs
at the present time a dynamic pro
gram to maintain itself and to chal
lenge the emotionalism of Commun
ism, Fascism, and Naziism."
The teacher is an important ele
ment in a positive program of edu
cation for the maintenance of Ameri
can democracy.
"In our schools," he said, "we must
put emphasis on the meaning of
democracy and make school a place
where democracy is lived."
SCHOOLS FOSTER LEADERSHIP
Professor Quillen stated that one
of the greatest lacks of the American
people is the ability to think effec
tively about social problems. He
suggested that children be trained
in social skills, and that the schools
foster a new conception of leader
ship.
"We must stress the pattern of
leadership," Dr. Quillen said. "An
individual must assume the respon
sibility of leadership when he has
most to contribute to the group;
when he cannot contribute, he must
follow."
Dr. Quillen said schools should be
more concerned with the presenta
tion of various points of view on con
troversial subjects. Otherwise, he

continued, American youth will be
come easy prey to outside influences
through the fact that they fail to
recognize propaganda.
ACHIEVE DEMOCRATIC VALUES
"We have the responsibility to
make the school a more integral
part of the community," said Pro
fessor Quillen. "We must strive to
find areas of agreement between the
various groups in a community if we
want to achieve democratic values."
Professor Quillen declared that a
teacher should be a living example
of democracy, which he defined as
"a recognition of the fact that in all
individuals there are human possi
bilities, no matter how low that per
son is."
