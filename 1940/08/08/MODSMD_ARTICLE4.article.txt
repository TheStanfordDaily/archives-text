# Barrie Fete Calls Dr. Bailey
## Pasadena Group To Hear Farm Lecturer 
### 
In tbp midst of preparations for
Dramatists' Assembly week, and
between supervising the arrange
ment of the library exhibit on the
Bonstelle Repertory Companies, see
ing that the Alliance publications are
ready for distribution and preparing
to receive the guest speaker of the
week. Dr. Margery Bailey is finding
time to travel to Pasadena over the
week-end to deliver the final Sun
day evening lecture sponsored by
the Pasadena Playhouse in connec
tion with their Barrie festival. The
final play of the festival, which will
be the topic for Dr. Bailey's lecture,
is "What Every Woman Knows."
Dr. Bailey will point out in her
lecture Barrie's grasp of the ener
getic qualities of the feminine mind,
especially as they were revealed
through the character of his mother,
Margaret Ogilvie, who seems to have
been the prototype of all his best
heroines. This final Barrie lecture
coincides in an interesting way with
our own Dramatists' Alliance com
edy lecture series. Surely what ev
ery woman knows is that life must
be taken with humorâ€”the only in
gredient which can secure under
standing, tolerance, and grace.
Dr. Bailey will leave the campus
Saturday evening, lecture in Pasa
dena Sunday evening, and return to
the campus in time to witness the
group reading presentation of the
Anderson Verse Award play which
will begin the festivities of Assem
bly Week.
