# Drama Award Winner Told By Alliance
## Group to Present Nusbaum Play At Evening Program 
### 
Stanford's Dramatists' Alliance an
nounced yesterday that N. Richard
Nusbaum of Philadelphia had won
the 1940 Maxwell Anderson Verse
Award with a one-act play treating
of oppression in present day Europe,
entitled "A Parting at Insdorf."
Second place was given to Wal
lace A. Bacon of Detroit, Michigan,
for his intense and stirring treatment
of the great Italian liberator, "Sa
vanarola." Maxwell Anderson, to
whom Mr. Bacon read his play this
past winter, was particularly en
thusiastic about it, praising the
verse very highly.
Third place went to George Fass
of New York City for his "Night
Cafe," a sensitive picturization of
modern failures. Mr. Fass' easy
ability to catch the cadences of or
dinary American speech and to raise
it to the level of poetry without ever
becoming merely poetic is his chief
merit.
PLOT TELLS OF DILEMMA
The plot of the Nusbaum play
deals with a modest parson, his
daughter and a young English scout
who is being hunted by the Nazis.
The characters of the old priest and
his daughter are those of individuals
caught in the toils of a merciless
destiny.
These two pathetic figures are
symbolic of human beings living in
Europe today, who are faced with
problems and alternatives, and yet
are not masters of their own lives.
Mr. Nusbaum keeps his play above
the level of propaganda and still
succeeds in presenting a stark,
though restrained, tragic theme.
Members of Dramatists' Alliance
will read the play Monday evening
at 8:15 o'clock in the Education
Auditorium along with two other
one-act plays.
Cast in the Nusbaum play, "A
Parting at Insdorf," will be A. Grove
Day and Don Brown in the major
roles, and Miss Shirley Cady as the
pastor's daughter.
MACGAW AWARD WINNER
Also to be read during the course
of the evening will be the winner of
the MacGaw Award, "A Thing
Called Power," by Pauline Short
ridge of West Virginia, which is an
study of the mind of a dictator,
Napoleon.
The part of Napoleon will be read
by Edward Bode, who has appeared
in "The Contrast" and "She Stoops
to Conquer." The part of Queen
Louise, antagonist of Napoleon,
will be read by Miss Lucie Bentley.
HONEYMOON COMEDY
One of the best of the one-act
comedies submitted to the contests

Angus Bowmer of Ashland, Ore.,
which will be the third play to be
presented.
In charge of the arranging and

Auditorium along with two other

Cast in the Nusbaum play, "A

Day and Don Brown in the major

pastor's daughter.
MACGAW AWARD WINNER

Called Power," by Pauline Short
ridge of West Virginia, which is an
study of the mind of a dictator,

comedies submitted to the contests
this year is "Rogue Rest," written by
Angus Bowmer of Ashland, Ore.,

Stanford's Dramatists' Alliance an
nounced yesterday that N. Richard
Nusbaum of Philadelphia had won
the 1940 Maxwell Anderson Verse
Award with a one-act play treating
of oppression in present day Europe,
entitled "A Parting at Insdorf."
Second place was given to Wal
lace A. Bacon of Detroit, Michigan,
for his intense and stirring treatment
of the great Italian liberator, "Sa
vanarola." Maxwell Anderson, to
whom Mr. Bacon read his play this
past winter, was particularly en
thusiastic about it, praising the
verse very highly.
Third place went to George Fass
of New York City for his "Night
Cafe," a sensitive picturization of
modern failures. Mr. Fass' easy
ability to catch the cadences of or
dinary American speech and to raise
it to the level of poetry without ever
becoming merely poetic is his chief
merit.
PLOT TELLS OF DILEMMA
The plot of the Nusbaum play
deals with a modest parson, his
daughter and a young English scout
who is being hunted by the Nazis.
The characters of the old priest and
his daughter are those of individuals
caught in the toils of a merciless
destiny.
These two pathetic figures are
symbolic of human beings living in
Europe today, who are faced with
problems and alternatives, and yet
are not masters of their own lives.
Mr. Nusbaum keeps his play above
the level of propaganda and still
succeeds in presenting a stark,
though restrained, tragic theme.
