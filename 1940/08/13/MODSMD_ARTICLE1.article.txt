# National Experts Open Public Relations Course
## Businessmen Here to Study Problems of Society Relation 
### 
One hundred ninety-five business men and leaders, representing 59 in
dustries, registered yesterday for the Stanford University two weeks course
in public relations.
Sponsored jointly by Stanford University and the American Council of
Public Relations, the course will attempt to present by means of lectures

and panel discussions the problems
of the business man, and offer solu
tions.
In the first meeting of the session,
Harwood L. Childs, associate profes
sor of politics at Princeton Univer
sity, said that every situation could
be resolved into five steps.
PUBLIC MAY BE CLASSIFIED
"First," Dr. Childs said, "we must
know our publics, and then we must
study public opinion trends. After
finding out why pubilc opinion is
what it is, we must either put our
house in order or tell our story."
The publics which interest the
business man most may be classified
by their interests into government,
political, economic, and religious.
"Most people," Dr. Childs contin
ued, "are members of more than one
of these publics; and the starting
point for dealing with public rela
tion problems is to become acquaint
ed with the publics.
SATISFY TOTAL INTERESTS
"If business does not give the pub
lic what it wants, the public will find
a way to get it for itself," Dr. Childs
said. "We must satisfy the totality of
interests of all individuals if we
want a satisfied public."
Rex F. Harlow, lecturer on public
relations at Stanford University and
president of the American Council
on Public Relations, presided over
yesterday's forum, and will lecture
daily on the principles of public re
lations.
GUINEA PIG' BOOKS WANTED
"Women play the dominant part
in consumer relations," said Miss
Mabel G. Flanley, eastern director of
consumer relations for the Borden
Company and that probably ac
counts for the erratic, feminine na
ture of the movement."
Public opinion, Miss Flanley said,
was creating a distrust of business,
as revealed by growth in demand for
"guinea pig books." Consumers are
seeking the aid of the government to
solve their problems in the form of
consumer protection laws.

economics at the University of Wis
