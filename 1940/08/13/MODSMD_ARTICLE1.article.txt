# National Experts Open Public Relations Course
## Businessmen Here to Study Problems of Society Relation 
### 
One hundred ninety-five business men and leaders, representing 59 in
dustries, registered yesterday for the Stanford University two weeks course
in public relations.
Sponsored jointly by Stanford University and the American Council of
Public Relations, the course will attempt to present by means of lectures

and panel discussions the problems
of the business man, and offer solu
tions.
In the first meeting of the session,
Harwood L. Childs, associate profes
sor of politics at Princeton Univer
sity, said that every situation could
be resolved into five steps.
PUBLIC MAY BE CLASSIFIED
"First," Dr. Childs said, "we must
know our publics, and then we must
study public opinion trends. After
finding out why pubilc opinion is
what it is, we must either put our
house in order or tell our story."
The publics which interest the
business man most may be classified
by their interests into government,
political, economic, and religious.
"Most people," Dr. Childs contin
ued, "are members of more than one
of these publics; and the starting
point for dealing with public rela
tion problems is to become acquaint
ed with the publics.
SATISFY TOTAL INTERESTS
"If business does not give the pub
lic what it wants, the public will find
a way to get it for itself," Dr. Childs
said. "We must satisfy the totality of
interests of all individuals if we
want a satisfied public."
Rex F. Harlow, lecturer on public
relations at Stanford University and
president of the American Council
on Public Relations, presided over
yesterday's forum, and will lecture
daily on the principles of public re
lations.
GUINEA PIG' BOOKS WANTED
"Women play the dominant part
in consumer relations," said Miss
Mabel G. Flanley, eastern director of
consumer relations for the Borden
Company and that probably ac
counts for the erratic, feminine na
ture of the movement."
Public opinion, Miss Flanley said,
was creating a distrust of business,
as revealed by growth in demand for
"guinea pig books." Consumers are
seeking the aid of the government to
solve their problems in the form of
consumer protection laws.
SEE STATES OF MIND
Don D. Lescohier, professor of
economics at the University of Wis
consin, disclaimed the American at
titude of pointing a finger at par
ticular persons as the cause of any
situation in his lecture on "Indus
trial Relations and Public Rela
tions."
"The solution of labor problems
will not be found in individual cases,
but in conditions which cause par
ticular states of mind," Dr. Lesco
hier said.
He lays lack of understanding at
the basis of most labor troubles.
GOVERNMENT INTERFERES
"Business must try to have good
relations with public service," said
Russell L. Greenman, consultant on
management-government relations
with McKinsey and Company, New
York.
Government interferes directly in
business by propaganda, by taxing
power, subsidies, education, and di
rect competition, Mr. Russell stated.
Business could profit if it learned
to use some of the government agen
cies, Mr. Russell said. For years
various government bureaus have
been collecting material of use to the
ordinary employer if he only took
the trouble to find out.
SHOW POLLS RESULTS
In conclusion, Dr. Norman C.
Meier, professor of psychology at the
University of lowa, suggested that
Americans stimulate thinking about
important problems by getting those
pictures clearly pictured by means
of cross-section pools.
"These results could then be pre
sented to a group of experts," Dr.
Meier said, "and when the experts
have reacted to them, the results
should be sent back to the people on
whom the poll was originally tried."
SYNTHESIZE DISSENT
Dr. Meier suggested that the dis
sent could be synthesized into a pic
ture where the area of agreement
and disagreement would be clear,
and then proceed to act on the area
of agreement.
"Unless the United States evolves
some way of thinking as a group
and co-operating on its best ideas,
this country will be subject to the
same lack of coo-perative purpose
which overtook England and
France," Dr. Meier warned.
In the evening discussion forum,
a panel composed of six faculty
members answered written and oral
questions submitted by enrollees.
Public relations problems of the
labor unions occupied much of the
time, while the increase in closed
shops and consumers' co-operatives
were also dealt with at some length.
