# Digging Doings Halt 'Hitching'
## Underpass Work Reroutes Traffic

It will still be a month or more
before Farm traffic will be able to
enjoy the scenic beauties and con
venience of Palm Drive, according
to Alfred L. Trowbridge, assistant
comptroller.
Due to the construction of the
underpass, the entrance to Palm
Drive from El Camino Real, as well
as the entrance to University Ave
nue, has been blocked.
This construction feat has pre
sented a very difficult problem to
"car-less" farm students: how to get
a ride into Paly and back?
Before the days of construction
wonders, all the hitch hikers had to
do was to stand at the corner on the
campus end of Palm Drive, diag
onally across from the History Cor
ner, and wave their tumbs. Now
with half the traffic going via Em
barcadero and the other half going
past the hospital, they don't know
where to stand.
Farm tradition has always ruled
that those with cars pick up those
without. So for the convenience of
drivers and ride-hitchers, we sug
gest that those desiring rides into
Paly stand at the corner of Galvez
Street by Encina Hall.
Stanford officials have requested
that as much as possible of the traf
fic going from the campus into Palo
Alto use Galvez Street and Embarca
dero.
