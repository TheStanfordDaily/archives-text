# Psychiatry Can Prevent Murder Says Dr. ration
## Scientific Methods Urged in Reforming Potential Criminals 
### 
A forceful argument for a greater
use of psychiatry by courts and penal
institutions is made by Dr. Joseph D.
Catton, clinical professor of medicine
at Stanford and practicing psychi
atrist, in his book called "Behind the
Scenes of Murder," published this
week.
"There will be a hundred murder
ers tomorrow," he believes, "to
match each hundred killers of yes
terdayâ€”unless something is done to
change the character of the man who
kills, or the character of the world
in which he lives.
SIXTY TO SLAY
"It is my opinion that even with
the complete scientific survey of
murder in the abstract, and the most
thorough reports of individual de
linquents, science must admit that
out of each one hundred persons
who are the killers of tomorrow,
there are sixty who will slay re
gardless of what is done concerning
them or the society in which they
live.
"Many of these potential murder
ers make no contact with the law
before committing some major
crime. Indeed, the act of murder may
be the first public information of
their antisocial nature, the first op
portunity for society to examine
them."
The problem society is faced with
is the method of dealing with the
other 40 per cent of potential killers
whose crimes are preventable. In
this category fall such types of mur
der as those inspired by rage, sexual
slayings, alcoholic homicides, and
those who murder in orgiastic and
sadistic frenzies.
ORGIASTS NEED SCIENCE
In dealing with these latter pre
ventable murders, Dr. Catton
stresses the need for a liaison of law
and science. In particular he be
lieves that clinics should be oper
ated in connection with jails and
prisons and criminal courts. These
clinics should be made a definite and
consistent element of judicial ma
chinery, he says.
In the latter part of his book the
doctor-author sets forth personal ex
periences as a trial expert, with ac
counts of personal interviews with
murderers, and a study of the va
garies of killers who attempt to
simulate insanity.
