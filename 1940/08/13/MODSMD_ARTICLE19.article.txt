# Farm Alumnus Dies in Berkeley
## 
### 
Dane Coolidge, a graduate of
Stanford in 1898, died last Thursday
in Berkeley. He was noted as a nat
uralist and a writer of western tales.
He began his writing as a student
of Indian lore and culture, and a col
lector of birds and animals. His first
specimens were collected in Death
Valley, and this well known spot was
the locale for many of his novels.
