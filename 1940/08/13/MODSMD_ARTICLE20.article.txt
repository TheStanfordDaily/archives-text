# Farm Reading Center Work Is 'Swell', Students Agree
## 
### MARGARET LUCKETT High School Student in the Reading Center 
"The work here is swell" <
This is the consensus of opinion of
the 30 students of the Stanford Read
ing Center, one of the summer
classes offered by the School of Edu
cation. These students have come
daily for the past six weeks to the
Engineering Building, where the
Center is located, to receive help
with various problems in reading.
The Center was established three
years ago by Professor Holland D.
Robberts and Eason Monroe, the
present directors, not only to help
with reading difficulties, but to pro
mote a better understanding and ap
preciation by the students of their
social relationships.
The students are divided into four
groups according to their ages. The
two younger groups meet in the
morning between 10 and 12 o'clock.
The older members of the school
meet in the afternoon from 1 to 3
o'clock.
WORK EVENLY DIVIDED
Many subjects are being pursued
this summer — everything from col
lecting the styles of different authors
to reading about trains. Each stu
dent has his own personal counselor,
an experienced graduate student in
the School of Education.
Preference of type of work is very
evenly divided among the students.
Some like the group work better
because they enjoy being with other
students and receiving their opin
ions. Others like the counseling
work better because of shyness or
of the nature of the work they are
doing.
STUDENTS GAIN OBJECTIVES
The main reason given by the
Reading Center students for coming
to the Center is to increase their
speed and comprehension. Some
came to learn how to read.. And a
few came to learn to like reading.
All of the students feel that they
have achieved their objectives —
many believe they have received

•more tlian they had expected.
Although this school operates dur
ing summer vacation, a number of
the members enrolled of their own
accord. They, of course, enjoy the
work. Part of those who came be
cause their parents thought it best
are also enjoying the class. As in
everything, there is a small minority
that the Center hasn't "reached."
To many of the students this work
is the most important occupation
they have this summer.
