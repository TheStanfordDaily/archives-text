# Sparducks Win; Wheel Chair 'Darby' Ends
## Agonists' End Seen By Record Crowd At Thursday Battle 
### WARREN CLEARY 
With a roaring crowd to cheer
them on, the Sparducks pounded out
a hard-fought win over the Agonists
last Thursday to cop the title in
the Wheel Chair League, with a 4
to 3 count.
The tilt turned out to be a pitch
ing and fielding duel with the score
tied up until the last of the fifth,
when the Sparducks whacked in the
winning tally. The Agonists tried
very hard to make it up, but fancy
ball handling by Ned Johns of the
Duck aggregation made any such
feat impossible.
SPARDUCKS LOSE ONCE
The Sparducks went through the
season with only one loss and showed
a fine spirit in all their games. They
are to be congratulated on their
record.
Dr. Grayson N. Kefauver, dean
of the School of Education, was on
hand to present the winner with
the loving cup.
Movies have been taken of the
games in the semifinals and the
finals and The Happy Worrier Harry

Shipkey announced that these mov
ing pictures will be shown next
year during summer quarter.
TIFFS ENDED
Now the season is over and all the
fields are deserted and we hope that
everyone who played enjoyed them
selves and built themselves up to re
semble big husky kids in the past
month. We are sure that congratu
lations are in order for Harry Ship
key, the man who was back in the
League during the quarter.
Harry put long hours in on mak
ing out the schedules and arranging

everything so that we could go right
out on the field and play. It's no
cinch turning a bunch of hyenas
into a ball club and he certainly did
a swell job.
Thanks a lot, Harry, we all appre
ciate the effort you exerted in mak
ing the Wheel Chair League of Sum
mer Quarter, 1940, a howling suc
cess.
Well, don't take any wooden
nickels.
