# HALF AIR CADETS WASHOUTS

WASHINGTON. â€” Half of those
who start aviation training in the
Army are reported to be "wash
outs." The Army has this 50 per cent
waste through failure because they
do not have a proper test for select
ing the best men for training. This
waste will not be greatly reduced by
the Civil Aeronautics Board's new
program of aviation training.
