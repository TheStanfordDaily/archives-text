# Teachers Wind Up Fling on Farm
## 
### 
Attention, all undergraduates â€”
hereafter, walk the campus in pairs;
schedule appointments; don't leave
to chance meeting someone on
Quad. Education School finishes this
coming Saturday and then the pe
regrinations will begin.
The mass exodus of 385 students
is that imminent. An interesting fact
concerning the "385" is that only
about 10 are not seeking degrees.
These are here to make contacts or
to have a summer vacation coupled
with some work in California. Odd,
only ten feeling this way.
Those that are hoping to reach the
Middle West in time for school will
have to leave immediately following
the conclusion of their finals on Sat
urday.
Los Angelenos will have plenty of
time to catch up on the home-town
gossip since their schools do not
open until the day after Labor Day.
San Francisco starts its schools on
August 26, so those teachers re
turning to the realm of the clouds
will be given a week of sunshine
before they start losing their sum
mer's tan.
