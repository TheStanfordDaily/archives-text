# Farm Doctors Discover And Market Novel Ointment
## 
### 
Announcement of the discovery of
a new, non-greasy, non-sticky, safe
and inexpensive ointment-base has
been made by Stanford scientists, the
San Francisco Chronicle reported
Sunday.
Doctors Maurice Tainter, George
Kulcher, and A. B. Stockton made
the announcement after two years
of experiments. Careful tests have
been carried out and distribution of
the preparation has begun on a
moderate scale in San Francisco
drug stores.
The base, which is made from El
konite, a naturally occurring vol
canic clay found in Nevada, can be
mixed with virtually any medical
drug that can be applied to the
skin. When rubbed on the skin, the
ointment disappears and leaves a

thin, almost invisible powder, which
holds the medicine in place.
The mixing of such sticky ingre
dients as sulphur or tar skin drugs
with Elkonite can be accomplished
without any of the resulting sub
stance rubbing off on clothes and
bedding or matting on hairy sur
faces.
Elkonite, known chemically as
aluminum-magnesium-silicate, has,
besides its medicinal uses, moderate
cleansing properties and possibly
laxative and other uses in the relief
of stomach and intestinal ailments.
In regard to expense, its discov
erers announced that Elkonite is
now selling on the market at seven
cents a pound and that the new oint
ment base can be made for one cent
a pound. One pound of Elkonite
makes seven pounds of ointment.
