The men and women who are re
sponsible for the health and comfort
of patients in Pacific Coast hospitals
gathered on the Stanford campus
yesterday for an intensive two
weeks' discussion of the problems in
their field.
Over 100 members of the Western
Institute of Hospital Administration
will consider latest developments in
foods and nutrition, the legal liabili
ties, insurance, personnel, profes
sional and community relationships
of hospital service.
AUTHORITIES TO SPEAK
Director of the Institute Benja
min W. Black, medical director of
the Alameda County Institutions,
welcome delegates this morning, and
announced the leading authorities to
lecture at the Institute. Among them
will be Dr. J. C. Doane, director of
the Jewish Hospital in Philadelphia;
Dr. A. C. Bachmeyer of the Uni
versity of Chicago Clinics in Chi
cago; Dr. Basil C. McClean, director
of the Strong Memorial Hospital at
Rochester, New York; Edgar C.
Hayhow, superintendent of the Pat
erson General Hospital, at Paterson,
N.J.; Dr. Malcolm T. MacEachern,

DIATETICS DISCUSSED
Taking up problems of dietetics,
Martha E. Davis, of the department
of home economics at the University
of California at Los Angeles, spoke
on the therapeutic phase of nutri
tion.
She remarked that the freezing of
fruits and vegetables by new proc
esses upon the market have opened
new aspects of hospital dietetics since
frozen foods lose almost none of
their nutritive values, are appetizing
to patients, and involve little in
preparation for servicing.
FIELD DEMONSTRATIONS
This afternoon, the members of
the Institute left the campus for
field demonstrations in hospitals in
San Mateo, Palo Alto, and San Jose.
Tomorrow morning, leading speak
er will be Dr. Doane of Philadelphia,
who will open the discussion of
laundry problems in hospitals. With
him will be Arnold Erlanger, man
ager of institutional sales of the U. S.
Hoffman Machinery Company of
New York.
