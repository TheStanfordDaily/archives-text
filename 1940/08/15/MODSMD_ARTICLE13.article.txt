Of course this doesn't mean a darn'
thing in particular, but still it's a
bit novel when you think of it, isn't
it: If 385 students attended Stanford
School of Education this summer
and each of them earned 10 units of
credit in education, that's a total of
3,850 units to be written into the rec
ords of 1940 summer session.

Albert Astor, graduate student in
Education and teacher in the San
Francisco schools, will be married on
August 31 to Miss Rose Tashjian,
also of San Francisco. Wedding will
be held in the Memorial Church.

Vacation time for faculty mem
bers, from this week-end to the
opening of the fall term, will find
them going here, there and every
where. Professor and Mrs. Alvin C.
Eurich will go to Bennington, Ver
mont, where he is director of an
education workshop at Bennington
College.,
Professor Holland D. Roberts and
Eason Monroe will set out to attain
the highest position in the whole
United States —the top of Mt. Whit
ney. They will leave next week and
will take several days for the big
climb, including a bit of conditioning
for muscles somewhat softened by
arduous summer school duties.
Dr. Walter V. Kaulfers will visit
with relatives at LaJolla. Dean Ke
fauver and his family will hie to
their cottage retreat in the high
Sierras.
The J. Paul Leonards will betake
themselves to a retreat in King's
Canyon. Mr. and Mrs. John H. Cor
nehlsen will seek relaxation at Lake
Hunnicutt.

Dr. Ralph R. Fields will take his
family to Southern California,
where they will enjoy the beaches
and sunshine. "Also," said Dr. Fields,
"I'm going to try to get my golf
score down from 105 to 95." He will
also combine business with pleasure,
however, by observing the work of
some practice teachers taking their
training as internes in schools of that
part of the state.
"We have no definite plans," said
Dr. Jesse B. Sears, "but will prob
ably take a trip north, for a little
relaxation and fresh air."
Dr. Elwood Patterson Cubberley,
emeritus dean of the School of Edu
cation, has a different plan for vaca
tion. He will keep right on working
at his job of recataloging the books
in the School of Education Library.
"If I want some vacation, I'll just
take a day off," he said. "One of
the compensations of being retired is
that I can—and do—work when I
feel like it and rest when I'm tired.
I'm perfectly satisfied with this plan,
and do not want to take a trip."
Professor I. James Quillen is plan
ning to put in a busy time. He will
go to Gary, Indiana, to gather ma
terial on a book he is writing about
that city, to be entitled, "Gary, a
Twentieth Century City." Signifi
cance of Gary is that it is a one
industry ctiy, a melting pot, and that
it has a significant school system.
The book will be a sociological-his
torial study, he said, and will cover
the years 1904-1929. Influence of
technology on development of the
city is of interest, he pointed out, be

♦cause it was built by modern ma
chinery, on land thai had been
J worthless.
Professor Quillen will also work on
a series of textbooks being produced
under his and Dr. Paul R. Hanna's
supervision, under the title of "So
cial Studies," and reported in this
column Tuesday.
Dean Grayson N. Kefauver, de
livered an address at Berkeley on
Wednesday, entitled, "Which Way
American Youth?" to a general
council of the Congregational and
Christian churches.

A group of Stanford educationists
is participating in preparation of a
report on a three-year study of
problems of individual differences of
high school English students, under
direction of the Committee on Indi
vidual Differences of the National
Council of Teachers of English, an
nounced Miss Nellie Appy of Broad
way high school, Seattle, committee
chairman and at present at Stanford.
Under the title, "Democracy, Eng
lish and Individual Differences," the
report is to be presented at the meet
ing of the National Council at Chi
cago in November.
How problems of individual dif
ferences are dealt with by classroom
teachers will be shown. Besides Miss
Appy, Stanford educators working on
the project include Professors J.
Paul Leonard and Holland D. Rob
erts. The study covers a three-year
period.

Now as to the fact that this is the
last issue of The Daily before the
close of the summer session for edu
cation students: It's just simply to
say good-bye, good luck and suc
cess during the school year ahead,
and see y'all next summer.
