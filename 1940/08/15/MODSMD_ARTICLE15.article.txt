# Stanford Co-ed Turns Back On Glamor for University Life
## 
### 
At this point in every quarter, we 4
are all asking ourselves why on earth
we wanted to come to college any
way.
Just before finals, when the
chances of flunking out seem much
too good, when we don't see how we
can possibly finish all that work in
just two weeks, we rationalize our
selves into an "anti-college-educa
tion" fervor. School just doesn't
seem to be worth the effort!
But somehow, Stanford and Stan
ford life has a mysterious appeal to
its inmates. A week after they're
out of school, they're wishing that
they were back again. The long
stretches of burning the midnight oil,
finals hysteria, and the like, are all
forgotten.
On the contrary, the memories of
days at the boathouse, moonlight
walks on the Quad, and of course,
the Beta-Delt boat dance, bring back
a distinct longing for the "good old
days."
TURNS DOWN CONTRACT
As a matter of fact, there is a gal
here at Stanford who was wooed by
Hollywood, put through all the rig
ors of a screen test, made good, and
then turned down a five-year con
tractâ€”just to come back to school.
And what's more, the story of her
refusal to become a movie queen
brought Sylvia Berry, Stanford co
ed, a two-hundred dollar check from
Scribner's Commentator, who spon
sored an article contest for men and
women undergraduate students in
American colleges. Her article was
titled, "I Took a Screen Test."
STANFORD JUNIOR
Sylvia, now in her junior year and
a member of the Alpha Phi sorority,
hails from Beverly Hills. The clos
est she had ever come to Hollywood
had been on a sight-seeing tour
through a studio.
Last spring quarter, Sylvia ap
peared in the leading role of Stan
ford's production of "Warrior's Hus
band." A movie scout in the audience
came to the conclusion that here
was a Katherine Hepburn that had
been hiding between the haystacks
on the Farm.
After a week of screen tests, in
terviews, and photographing, the
blonde Stanfordite was offered a
five-year movie contract. And she
said, "No!"
In her article, Sylvia says: "The

'Hollywood people can't believe that
anyone would really prefer college
to the movies. They still think it's a
gag and that I'm holding out for
more money. They tell me I'll have
lost my youth and freshness if I don't
sign right now. 'A little of that col
lege stuff goes a long way,' they
warn me, 'and too much of it was
never known to help a girl's
oomph!'"
Well, it looks to us as if college
isn't doing Syliva any harm, so may
be it is rather a nice place to be.
Guess we had better start studying
for finals!
