# Satire Needed In Wartime
## Critic Says Humor Necessary to Stage 
### 
Serious drama to give us moral
strength, and sparkling comedy to
keep our sense of humor active —
these are just as essential to the pub
lic in times of national emergency
as in peace-time, S. Stephenson
Smith of the American Society of
Composers, Authors, and Publish
ers, told the radio-audience in an
interview on the Stanford Univer
sity—On the Air program from Sta
tion KPO last evening.
Answering numerous questions
on the part which the American
theater can play in the national de
fense program, Mr. Smith warned
that attempts to impose censorship
over the entertertainment field may
be expected soon.
WARNING: FIGHT CENSORSHIP
"Against censorship all the forces
of the entertainment world should
stand united," Mr. Smith declared.
"On this score theatrical and movie
producers, broadcasters, dramatists,
and song-writers should fight shoul
der to shoulder. For all have a com
mon interest in insuring a constant
supply of lively, novel, and arresting
material in song and drama.
"There Shall Be No Night," Rob
ert Sherwood's drama on the Russo-

Finnish War, is an example of the
best type of serious play written un
der the shadow of war, Mr. Smith
believes. "Of Thee I Sing," "Let
'Em Eat Cake," and similar comedies
by George Kaufman, Norie Ryskind,
the Gershwins and other playwrights
were praised as excellent political
drama.
SAFEGUARD SENSE OF HUMOR
"Our theater has a lot to say that
will keep the American spirit alive
and quick and vital, and remind us
of our sense of humor, too," Mr.
Smith asserted.
"Our political battles are usually
so funny in themselves, they don't
need the added touch of the comic
stage. We had to wait until George
Gershwin, Irving Berlin, Cole Porter,
Mare Blitzstein, and Harold Rome
hit on the trick of setting politics to
music."
Safeguarding the national sense of
humor will be a duty of the theater
in time of war, and a lively tune or
clever satire can do much to main
tain this balance, he said.

theater can play in the national de
fense program, Mr. Smith warned
that attempts to impose censorship
over the entertertainment field may
be expected soon.
WARNING: FIGHT CENSORSHIP
"Against censorship all the forces
of the entertainment world should
stand united," Mr. Smith declared.
"On this score theatrical and movie
producers, broadcasters, dramatists,
and song-writers should fight shoul
der to shoulder. For all have a com
mon interest in insuring a constant
supply of lively, novel, and arresting
material in song and drama.
"There Shall Be No Night," Rob
ert Sherwood's drama on the Russo-

Finnish War, is an example of the
best type of serious play written un
der the shadow of war, Mr. Smith
believes. "Of Thee I Sing," "Let
'Em Eat Cake," and similar comedies
by George Kaufman, Norie Ryskind,
the Gershwins and other playwrights
were praised as excellent political
drama.
SAFEGUARD SENSE OF HUMOR
"Our theater has a lot to say that
will keep the American spirit alive
and quick and vital, and remind us
of our sense of humor, too," Mr.
Smith asserted.
"Our political battles are usually
so funny in themselves, they don't
need the added touch of the comic
stage. We had to wait until George
Gershwin, Irving Berlin, Cole Porter,
Mare Blitzstein, and Harold Rome
hit on the trick of setting politics to
music."
Safeguarding the national sense of
humor will be a duty of the theater
in time of war, and a lively tune or
clever satire can do much to main
tain this balance, he said.
Lane Medical Library was erected
in San Francisco in 1910 with $150,-
000 left under the will of Mrs. Levi
Cooper Lane, widow of the founder
of Cooper Medical College, the first
Stanford building given by and
named after a donor other than the
Stanfords.
Serious drama to give us moral
strength, and sparkling comedy to
keep our sense of humor active —
these are just as essential to the pub
lic in times of national emergency
as in peace-time, S. Stephenson
Smith of the American Society of
Composers, Authors, and Publish
ers, told the radio-audience in an
interview on the Stanford Univer
sity—On the Air program from Sta
tion KPO last evening.
Answering numerous questions
on the part which the American
theater can play in the national de
fense program, Mr. Smith warned
that attempts to impose censorship
over the entertertainment field may
be expected soon.
