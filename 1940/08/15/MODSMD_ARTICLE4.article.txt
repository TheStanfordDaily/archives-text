# Insurance Plans Revolutionize Hospitalization
## Dr. Doane Offers Solution to Greater Hospital Privileges 
### 
The rapid growth of group "three
cent-a-day" hospital insurance plans
in America has revolutionized the
field of hospitalization and will be
the one thing, perhaps, which will
forestall government management of
United States hospitals, according to
Dr. J. C. Doane, administrator, edi
tor, and author.
Dr. Doane is the director of the
Jewish Hospital in Philadelphia, edi
tor of "Modern Hospital," and a pro
fessor at the Temple University
Medical School. He is now on the
Stanford Universtiy campus to par
ticipate in the Western Institute of
Hospital Administrators meeting
here.
Although the group plans are col
lective forms of social action, Dr.
Doane looked upon them as the life
savers of community hospitals as
they answer the need for greater hos
pital privileges to a greater number
of people through a voluntary plan
rather than through government
regulation.
PLANS AFFECT BUILDING
The new plans have revised con
structional design for hospitals since
they increase extensively the num
ber of semi-private beds required
while formerly private and ward
beds had to be most numerous. The
demands of the group plans are al
ready forcing hospitals to remodel,
and will affect future building, he
declared.
Financially, the group plans have
literally "kept the wolf from the
door" of the voluntary community
hospital, he continued. Depression
years, plus diminished returns from
investments, have cut deeply into
hospital endowments, but the new
influx of patients able to pay for hos
pital service through the group
plans have brought recovery to the
hospitals, and in many cases en
abled them to expand their services.
Dr. Doane is staying on the Stan
ford campus for the duration of the
conference, and has spent the last
two afternoons visiting hospitals on
the Peninsula. He remarked that
western hospitals seem to be newer,
and to have more modern architec
tural design in comparison to those
in the East which were built many
years ago and have not been
changed greatly during the succeed
ing years.
