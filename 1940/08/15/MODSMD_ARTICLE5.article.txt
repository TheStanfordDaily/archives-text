## Dugan's Lads Control Blaze Behind Toyon 
### 
The quiet of the Stanford campus
was broken last night during the
dinner hour by the raucus howling
of the fire house whistle.
Members of the Beta House for
Boys came tumbling out with their
bibs still on to watch the equipment
go roaring by. (Union service was
held up for a half hour.)
The '00 vintage Buick wound up
at the astonishing speed of five
miles an hour and chugged to the
border of the conflagration back of
Toyon Hall.
Without the use of ladders, nets,
or chemicals and under the surveil
lance of Fire Chief Dugan, the blaze
was brought under control and ex
tinguished after a half hour fight.
Total damage, three quarters of an
acre—burned.
