# Tolerant Labor Policy Needed, Says Economist
## Lescohier Tells Public Relations Conference Concessions Required 
### 
Asserting it was to the interest of
both capital and labor to see that
the other thrived, Dr. Don D. Lesco
hier, professor of economics at the
University of Wisconsin, told mem
bers of the shoi't course in public re
lations Tuesday afternoon that a
mutual understanding of problems
is necessary to resolve their misun
derstandings.
"You can't do business with a
dead man," declared Professor Les
cohier. "Labor should take an in
terest in keeping business alive
rather than promoting solely its own
interests. Unions and employees
both must recognize the 'live and let
live' principle."
Faithful observance ox' agreements
and responsible management form
the basis for all sound industrial re
lations, the economist said.
"The curse of industrial relations
is that both labor and capital have
been trying to get by with eleven
rather than thirteen eggs in a doz
en," he asserted.
NO CHANGE IN LABOR ACT
Discussing trends in government
regulation of business, Russell L.
Greenman, consultant on manage
ment-government relations, prophe
sied the Wagner Act would survive
the present session of Congress un
changed.
With President Roosevelt com
mitted against alteration due to the
war situation and with both the
C.1.0. and labor in general opposed
to changing the act, Mr. Greenman
told the business representatives that
any change is highly improbable.
"It takes a courageous if not fool
hardy business man to appear before
a Washington hearing," the lecturer
declared. "It takes a lot of guts to
state that changes in the wage-hour
act are needed when the government
has power to persecute or prosecute
business for minor violations of the
act."
In predicting the trend of legisla
tion, investigations which may lead
to legislation as well as pending bills
must be watched, Mr. Greenman
asserted.
DAY OF INDIVIDUAL' PAST
Rex F. Harlow, president of the
American Council of Public Rela
tions, emphasized the importance of
public relations by asserting that
the day of rugged individualism is
past.
"The social consequences of in
creasing smallness of the world
makes public relations, measured in
terms of social action, increasingly
important," Mr. Harlow said.
Dr. Harwood L. Childs, Princeton
professor of politics, keynoted his
lecture on business and public opin
ion by stating that public relations
is a two-sided affair.
"All too frequently business ex
ecutives assume unfavorable public
opinion is due to lack of information
on the part of the public." Professor
Childs averred. "Often it is the ex
ecutive rather than the public who
is uninformed."
Concerning the sampling of pub
lic opinion, the authority said a
sound statistical foundation must
underly all sampling methods.
"Too often polls miss issues which
are of vital interest to the public.
Polls must be 'vitalized' by having
the public frame the questions in
order to insure its interest," he said.
Public relations experts in the fu
ture can avail themselves of the
technique of local opinion polls, Dr.
Chilton R. Bush, executive head of
the Stanford Division of Journalism
said. He also warned that loaded
questions might be used to mislead
the public.
"Polls are more accurate than
elections, which are merely uncon
trolled samples when a substantial
portion of the electorate fails to
vote," Dr. Bush said.
