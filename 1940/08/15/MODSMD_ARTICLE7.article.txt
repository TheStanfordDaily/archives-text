# World War May Last Ten Years, Economist Warns
## Public Relations Course Speakers Discuss War's Effect on Opinion 
### 
The clianges that occurred in the last war will he as nothing compared
to what will occur in the next five years, I)r. Don D. Lescohier, of the Uni
yesterday.
versity of Wisconsin, prophesied to the Short Course in Public Relations
Unless England is defeated by the end of summer, there is every reason

►to believe the war will continue to
drag on for the next ten to thirty
years. Dr. Lescohier offered as evi
dence the many wars of the past that
have taken as long as 100 years to
come to an end.
"Effects of Recent Developments
in Europe Upon the American La
bor Situation" was the subject of the
lecture by the silvery-haired pro
fessor of economics. He said that
patriotism and public opinion will
not check future labor difficulties.
The German menace is not yet
feared by the people and since they
are not afraid of invasion, patriot
ism is not in sway.
Refuting to some extent what Dr.
Lescohier said, Russell L. Green
man of McKinsey & Company, New
York, declared that the eastern sea
board is very definitely scared to
death. The people in New York City
know there are at present not enough
anti-aircraft guns on the coast to
defend Coney Island, much less
Greater New York, he asserted.
ARMAMENT BY WPA
"They hate to think that all that
stands between them and annihila
tion are armaments built by the
WPA," he added.
Going further, Mr. Greenman de
clared that the seaboard is afraid of
sabotage in the defense program and
of civil insurrection, and so is the
War Department. All essential de
fense plants are being requested to
move from both seacoasts to the in
terior, according to Mr. Greenman,
whose topic was "Government Plans
for Coping with the War Emer
gency."
Miss Mabel Flanley, of the Borden
Company, lecturing on "Advertising
—A Focal Point in Consumer Rela
tions," said that "one of the chief
manifestations of the consumer
movement is criticism of advertis
ing."
TEACHERS IGNORANT
The teachers and those of the high
er income brackets of the nation are
those most ignorant of the institu
tion of advertising as it really is, and
these are the two groups that wield
the greatest influence over advertis
ing, Miss Flanley asserts.
Explaining a proposed solution to
the problem, she asked for greater
truth in the institution, and for more
co-operation with the- educators.
The entire public must have ex
plained to it the need of the country
for advertising and the fact that it
actually lowers the price of the goods
that are purchased, Miss Fanley de
clared.
OPINION POLLS
Changing his topic at the last mo
ment, Dr. Harwood L. Childs, of
Princeton, spoke on "Public Opinion
Polls." Dr. Childs is a nationally
famous expert on the forces of pub
lic opinion. He believes that the rep
resentative sample, or formula
method of sampling the public belief,
is the best. This is the method used
with such success by the Gallup poll.
There are several factors — sex,
geographic location, economic status,
age, and political party—that govern
the selection of the sample public.
However, according to Dr. Childs,
"no sample can be truly representa
tive of the public in all respects."
"I can't understand why I've never
been asked." This statement can be
explained, said Dr. Childs, by the
fact that frequently only 2,500 or
3,500 ballots are used over the entire
country. The chance of it hitting you
is as remote as this.
The only actual test of a poll is a
pragmatic one, explained Dr. Childs,

for if the poll, in some measurable
way, gets near the results consist
ently, they have hit uopn some suc
cessful formula and might assume
future successes.
Dr. Harlow, of Stanford, started
the meeting with a discussion of
"Foundations of Public Relations."
He declared that a sound background
in the social sciences, with special
ization in one field, is imperative for
a successful individual in the field
of public relations. He must realize
that his dual task is "to serve him
self and to serve society."
