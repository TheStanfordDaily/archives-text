# World War May Last Ten Years, Economist Warns
## Public Relations Course Speakers Discuss War's Effect on Opinion 
### 
The clianges that occurred in the last war will he as nothing compared
to what will occur in the next five years, I)r. Don D. Lescohier, of the Uni
yesterday.
versity of Wisconsin, prophesied to the Short Course in Public Relations
Unless England is defeated by the end of summer, there is every reason

►to believe the war will continue to
drag on for the next ten to thirty
years. Dr. Lescohier offered as evi

clared that the seaboard is afraid of
sabotage in the defense program and
of civil insurrection, and so is the
War Department. All essential de
fense plants are being requested to
move from both seacoasts to the in
terior, according to Mr. Greenman,
whose topic was "Government Plans
for Coping with the War Emer
gency."
Miss Mabel Flanley, of the Borden
Company, lecturing on "Advertising
—A Focal Point in Consumer Rela
tions," said that "one of the chief
manifestations of the consumer
movement is criticism of advertis
ing."
TEACHERS IGNORANT
The teachers and those of the high
er income brackets of the nation are
those most ignorant of the institu
tion of advertising as it really is, and
these are the two groups that wield
the greatest influence over advertis
ing, Miss Flanley asserts.
Explaining a proposed solution to
the problem, she asked for greater
truth in the institution, and for more
