# Cubberley Adds Decimal; Book Cataloguing Solved
## 
### DWIGHT E. MITCHELL 
Education students who are find-<
ing each summer that the School of
Education library is steadily pro
gressing with its huge job of cata
loging and shelving books, so that
its service is becoming better and
better, may have begun to wonder
when the task will be completed.
Emeritus Dean Elwood Patterson
Cubberley and his staff of assistants
have been working on the job two
years and expect that it will require
three more years to complete it, he
said Wednesday.
One result of the work should be a
new conception of accurate and com
prehensive cataloging of education
books, an examination of their work
indicates.
SYSTEM TO BE EXACT
Based on amplification and refine
ment of the Dewey Decimal system
of library cataloging, the system de
veloped by Dean Cubberley is ex
pected to make education books
available to students in the most
complete and exact manner pos
sible.
Textbooks are cataloged and
shelved separately from other works.
Addition of another decimal point
to the Dewey system has made it
possible to carry out a greatly needed
classification, the Dean pointed out.
For instance, the addition makes
possible a multiplication by 10 of the
classification of works on the teach
ing of English. Similarly, 19 classi
fications replace only one for books
on mathematics and science; and
similarly for educational psychology
and numerous other fields.
How many books have been re
cataloged and how many will there
be when the work is completed? An
swer to those questions in difficult.
It is impossible to count all the books
now or to know how many there are
at any one time. Frequently a new
addition is made by the librarians
to the ever-swelling shelves and
card catalog.

But on an average, each foot of
shelf space will hold seven or eight
books, Dean Cubberley explained.
Hence it is possible to estimate

roughly; and it is reasonable to esti
mate that at least 45,000 books will
ever tually be shelved in the Educa
tion library and that within the
course of years the capacity of the
library as it now exists, some 150,000
volumes, will be taxed ot the utmost.
Roble Hall was completed in 1918,
the first new dormitory since 1891.

to the ever-swelling shelves and
card catalog.

But on an average, each foot of
shelf space will hold seven or eight
books, Dean Cubberley explained.
Hence it is possible to estimate

roughly; and it is reasonable to esti
mate that at least 45,000 books will
ever tually be shelved in the Educa
tion library and that within the
course of years the capacity of the
library as it now exists, some 150,000
volumes, will be taxed ot the utmost.

the first new dormitory since 1891.


DR. E. P. CUBBERLEY
Education students who are find-<
ing each summer that the School of
Education library is steadily pro
gressing with its huge job of cata
loging and shelving books, so that
its service is becoming better and
better, may have begun to wonder
when the task will be completed.
Emeritus Dean Elwood Patterson
Cubberley and his staff of assistants
have been working on the job two
years and expect that it will require
three more years to complete it, he
said Wednesday.
One result of the work should be a
new conception of accurate and com
prehensive cataloging of education
books, an examination of their work
indicates.
SYSTEM TO BE EXACT
Based on amplification and refine
ment of the Dewey Decimal system
of library cataloging, the system de
veloped by Dean Cubberley is ex
pected to make education books
available to students in the most
complete and exact manner pos
sible.
Textbooks are cataloged and
shelved separately from other works.
Addition of another decimal point
to the Dewey system has made it
possible to carry out a greatly needed
classification, the Dean pointed out.
For instance, the addition makes
possible a multiplication by 10 of the
classification of works on the teach
ing of English. Similarly, 19 classi
fications replace only one for books
on mathematics and science; and
similarly for educational psychology
and numerous other fields.
How many books have been re
cataloged and how many will there
be when the work is completed? An
swer to those questions in difficult.
It is impossible to count all the books
now or to know how many there are
at any one time. Frequently a new
addition is made by the librarians
to the ever-swelling shelves and
card catalog.
