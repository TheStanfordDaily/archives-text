# 'Pitch' Johnson Assumes Duties As Track Head
## New Coach Arrives On Farm, Succeeds Ellington, 'Dink' 
### 
Stanford's new track coach,
Franklin "Pitch" Johnson, arrived on
campus yesterday, and immediately
set about acquainting himself with
the Farm and vice versa.
Appointed as director of track and
field during winter quarter, John
son paid a couple of visits to the
campus at that time, taking time
out from his duties as director of
the annual Drake Relays and as
secretary-treasurer of the National
College Track Coaches' Association,
to meet members of the Board of
Athletic Control.
"We feel," said a member of the
Board after the selection, "that the
election of the new coach will pre
clude any possibility of verbal
battles in the local press and be
tween various alumni factions."
A native of St. Louis, Johnson
brings an enviable record as a com
petitor and coach to the local pic
ture. His selection, incidentally,
marks the third time in the past
three years that the B.A.C. has dug
up the cream of the mid-western
crop for a major sports coach.
IN PARIS OLYMPICS
Johnson first became a track
prominent as an undergraduate at
Illinois through 1922 to 1924. He
was a high and low hurdler and
broad jumper. He captained the
team in 1924. He tied the world's
record in the 110-hurdles in the '24
Olympics at Boston with a mark of
14.8, later reaching the semi-finals
in Paris.
Soon after graduation, "Pitch" be
came an assistant to Harry Gill at
his alma mater. He retained this
post through 1937 and then moved to
Drake as head coach. His teams won
the Missouri Valley titles in 1931,
1933, 1935, and 1936, placed second
four times, won third twice, and
went as low as fourth only once.
In the conference's indoor cham
pionships, his Drake squads have
won six firsts, two seconds, and one
third. No meets were held in '32 and
'33.
CROSS-COUNTRY EXPERT
Johnson has been especially suc
cessful in the cross-country, one of
the Farm's weakest sports. In 10
years, his teams have won 25 dual
meets while dropping only seven.
In the three years as National cross
country championships in 1937-38-
39, Drake has finished second, third,
and fourth, respectively.
Since 1933, he has served as sec
retary-treasurer of the N.C.T.C.A.
and several terms as a member of
the track and field committee of the
A.A.U. He was recently elected to a
four-year term on the rules commit
tee of the N.C.2.A.
Johnson is 39 years old, married,
and has two young sons. He is an
excellent badminton and squash
player, and shines on the golf
course, usually shooting somewhere
in the 80's.

broad jumper. He captained the
team in 1924. He tied the world's
record in the 110-hurdles in the '24
Olympics at Boston with a mark of
14.8, later reaching the semi-finals
in Paris.
Soon after graduation, "Pitch" be
came an assistant to Harry Gill at
his alma mater. He retained this
post through 1937 and then moved to
Drake as head coach. His teams won
the Missouri Valley titles in 1931,
1933, 1935, and 1936, placed second
four times, won third twice, and
went as low as fourth only once.
In the conference's indoor cham
pionships, his Drake squads have
won six firsts, two seconds, and one
third. No meets were held in '32 and
'33.
CROSS-COUNTRY EXPERT
Johnson has been especially suc
cessful in the cross-country, one of
the Farm's weakest sports. In 10
years, his teams have won 25 dual
meets while dropping only seven.
In the three years as National cross
country championships in 1937-38-
39, Drake has finished second, third,
and fourth, respectively.
Since 1933, he has served as sec
retary-treasurer of the N.C.T.C.A.
and several terms as a member of
the track and field committee of the
A.A.U. He was recently elected to a
four-year term on the rules commit
tee of the N.C.2.A.
Johnson is 39 years old, married,
and has two young sons. He is an
excellent badminton and squash
player, and shines on the golf
course, usually shooting somewhere
in the 80's.
Stanford's new track coach,
Franklin "Pitch" Johnson, arrived on
campus yesterday, and immediately
set about acquainting himself with
the Farm and vice versa.
Appointed as director of track and
field during winter quarter, John
son paid a couple of visits to the
campus at that time, taking time
out from his duties as director of
the annual Drake Relays and as
secretary-treasurer of the National
College Track Coaches' Association,
to meet members of the Board of
Athletic Control.
"We feel," said a member of the
Board after the selection, "that the
election of the new coach will pre
clude any possibility of verbal
battles in the local press and be
tween various alumni factions."
A native of St. Louis, Johnson
brings an enviable record as a com
petitor and coach to the local pic
ture. His selection, incidentally,
marks the third time in the past
three years that the B.A.C. has dug
up the cream of the mid-western
crop for a major sports coach.
IN PARIS OLYMPICS
Johnson first became a track
prominent as an undergraduate at
Illinois through 1922 to 1924. He
was a high and low hurdler and
broad jumper. He captained the
team in 1924. He tied the world's
record in the 110-hurdles in the '24
