# Chemical Multiple Births Discussed at Conference
## Fifty Distinguished Chemists Participate in Confab Here 
### 
Fifty distinguished organic chemists inaugurated a conference here to
day with an attack on one of their most puzzling problems—the study of
chemical "twins" and "quadruplets."
Known to scientists as stereo-isomers, these related compounds are
vitally involved in the functioning of living cells, and are probably at the

•corc of life itself.
One pair of these twins is the ordi
nary sugar glucose. It exists in
two forms so much alike that they
can be told apart only by careful
chemical tests. Yet one form of glu
cose is easily digested by the body,
while the other cannot be affected
by digestive ferments.
According to Dr. Roger Adams,
head of the department of chem
istry at the University of Illinois
and one-time president of the
American Chemical Society, thou
sands of organic chemicals exist as
"twins" or even as "quadruplets." If
they can be separated—which in it
self is a difficult job—they can be
told apart by their effect on light.
One twin will twist light to the right
the other to the left.
TWINS' ARE COMPOUNDS
He asserted that most of the
known "twins" are compounds
which are turned around a carbon
atom. Similar compounds are be
lieved to be turned around nitrogen
or arsenic atoms, but have not yet
been isolated.
In a discussion led by Dr. L. I.
Smith of the University of Minne
sota, it was claimed that these vir
tually indistinguishable twins can
be told apart by minute differences
in color. Even if the two chem
icals appear as colorless as water to
the naked eye, differences in hue
can be picked up by use of the
spectroscope.
OTHER SESSIONS LISTED
In other sessions here today, the
chemists under the leadership of
Dr. H. J. Lucas of Caltech and Dr.
C. R. Houser of Duke University
considered complex theories to ex
plain reactions between organic
chemicals.
The conference will continue until
Thursday. Included in the list of
world-famous chemists who will
lead discussions are L. F. Fieser, and
P. D. Bartlett of Harvard; W. E.
Bachman of the University of Michi
gan; W. G. Young of U.C.LA.; E. S.
Wallis of Princeton; M. D. Kjarasch
of Chicago; L. F. Small of the U. S.
Public Health Service; L. C. Craig
of Rockefeller; C. D. Hurd of North
western University; Ernest Ander
son of the University of Arizona; and
C. W. Porter and T. D. Stewart of
the University of California.
