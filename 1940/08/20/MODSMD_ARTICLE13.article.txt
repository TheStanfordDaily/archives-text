## 18th Century Satire Discussed in Critic 
### 
John Gay's "Beggar's Opera" was
a four-barrelled satire on Sir Robert
Walpole, upper and lower class so
ciety of the 18th century and a mu
sical take-off on Handel and the Ital
ian opera, concluded S. Stephenson
Smith in his lecture Tuesday to
members of the Dramatists Alliance.
Mr. Smith, educational consultant
to the American Society of Compos
ers, Authors, and Publishers, and
former Rhodes Scholar, reviewed the
life of John Gay and his political
feud with Sir Robert Walpole.
"Johnnie Gay hated middle class
convention; that is why he disliked
Sir Robert Walpole. He frankly pre
ferred the society of nobility to the
bourgeoisie, but on the other hand
he liked the low life of London. He
found high and low life to be much
alike, and he used this in has great
est work, "The Beggars Opera," Mr.
Smith said.
MOST SUCESSFUL MUSICAL
Though Mr. Gay was the only poet
of the 18th century who could write
singable verses, it was only by chance
that "The Beggars' Opera" was set
to music, Mr. Smith continued. The
night before the last dress rehearsal,
Gay hired an orchestra and got up
the accompaniment of English folk
tunes that made the satire the most
successful musical comedy of its gen
eration.
The character of Walpole was dis
tributed between Peacham, the re
ceiver of stolen goods, McKeith, the
highway robber, and a minor char
acter called Bob Booty. Walpole
himself came to see the play,
laughed at the jokes directed toward
himself, but prevented applied cen
sorship to all of Gay's plays there
after.

peared on the campus in 1899 with
Dr. Jordan and Professor A. W.
Smith as passengers.
