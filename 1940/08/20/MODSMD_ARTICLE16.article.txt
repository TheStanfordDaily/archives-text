# CONTINUE COURSES
## 
### 
President Roosevelt said last week
that it was the duty of young people

to continue the course of their edu
cation until they were called for
service to the nation. The statement
was made in a letter to Paul V. Mc-
Nutt, federal security administrator,
who had reported a serious problem
in universities and colleges because
young people were interrupting their
educations to enlist in the military
forces or take defense jobs.

In accordance with his dying
wishes, the ashes of Captain Bill
Royle, World War pilot and former
executive in the flying school at
Stanford, were last week scattered
over the Alameda Naval Air Sta
tion.

The Stanford Alumni Association
was organized in 1892.
