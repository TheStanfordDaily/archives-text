## Critic Discusses Shaw's Polemics 
### 
G. B. S. is a Quixote who tilts not
with windmills but with the evils of
a poverty, war, government, and the
oppression of minorities, declared
S. Stevenson Smith, ASCAP educa
tion counselor in his talk, "The Po
litical Comedies of George Bernard
Shaw" Friday night.
"Shaw has a militant and pugna
cious nature in fighting for what he
believes, but yet he is a pacifist," said
Mr. Smith. "He hates war between
men and machines," he explained.
Shaw's crusades are candy coated
with satiric humour, Mr. Smith con
tinued. At one time he compared
himself to Mark Twain. "We would
both be hanged for our ideas if we
didn't use humor," he is quoted as
saying.
CYNICAL ABOUT MARRIAGE
"Shaw has often been accused of
making his characters talk as he
does," Mr. Smith said. His retort
was, "Thank heavens, they do!"
Mr. Smith said Shaw is cynical
about the happiness attending mar
riage and family life. He quoted the
famous Shawism that "there are
twenty times as many divorces in
Oregon as in England; how unhappy
we Britishers must be!"
ANTI-POPULAR SOVEREIGNTY
Shaw considers Caesar in "Caesar
and Cleopatra" as a good after-din
ner speaker, a great newspaper cor
respondent, and a great man tolerant
of other people's opinions but not as
a destructive force, Mr. Smith stated.
"Although Shaw supports the Bill
of Rights, he does not believe in
government by the people," Mr.
Smith said. He believes 4hat those
especially fitted and trained for po
litical positions should hold them
regardless of the opinions of the
masses.
"However he may put it, Shaw
means what he says," Mr. Smith
concluded.
