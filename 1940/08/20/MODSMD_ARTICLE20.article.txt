# Critic Recites Idiosyncrasies Of Gilbert and Sullivan
## 
### 
People of every nation have their<
peculiarities, and it has been said
that "every Englishman is an island
unto himself," S. Stephenson Smith
declared in a lecture on "Gilbert and
Sullivan and Politics of the Victorian
Era last Thursday.
Mr. Smith, who was a Rhodes
scholar and is now education coun
selor of the American Society of
Composers, Authors, and Publish
ers, spoke on the particular pecu
liarities of Sir William Gilbert. He
said that Gilbert's career could easily
be traced through the court rec
ords, as he was always getting into
trouble over his satirizing of the
most sacred institutions of Great
Britain.
HATED RIGHTEOUSNESS
"Gilbert hated the sentimentality
and priggish righteousness of his
time," said Mr. Smith. "The au
thorities considered him a dangerous
man and were always on the lookout
for his 'insinuendoes'."
Mr. Smith said that Gilbert had
originally written burlesques—when
that word did not have its present
connotation. He went on to explain
that burlesque was really "a take
off (pause for audience to howl with
laughter) of an old legend."
QUEEN IRKED
"Queen Victoria," said Smith, "was
annoyed at anything which satirized
the 'figurehead' position of the Eng
lish monarch. Outraged at Gilbert's
librettoes in "The Gondoliers," she
took a subtle revenge. She ordered
a command performance of the
operetta at the palace, and had even
the name of the wigmaker printed
in large letters on the program, al
though Gilbert's name was omitted."
Gilbert was infuriated because
Sullivan was knighted about 20
years before he was. He did not
receive his peerage until Queen Vic
toria's death, when Edward VII took
great delight in knighting a man
whom his mother had particularly
disliked.
Gilbert's sense of humor(?) led

►Sullivan to burlesque the manner
isms of continental opera, said Smith.
!In one of their operas they had
three angels come out and say very
derogatory things about the English
government. The angels were made
up to look like three important
cabinet ministers, and this scene was
quickly suppressed.
"The Mikado," said Smith, "was
barred from English stages for many
years as the state department feared
Britain's ally (at that time), Japan,
would be insulted. But when they
discovered that the music from "The
Mikado" was being played all over
Japan, they lifted the ban, and this
operetta has always been a favorite
with British and American au
diences."
ACTRESSES SOCIAL OUTCASTS
Mr. Smith explained that in the
days of< Gilbert and Sullivan act
resses were frowned upon by so
ciety. "But," he said, "Gilbert
watched over the ladies in his casts
like a guardian angel. Once four
young men invited Jessie Bond, his
leading lady, to have supper with
them.
He considered this an insult to a
lady and told the young men that
they could either leave quietly or he
would come before the curtain and
announce that Miss Bond would not
sing until they had left the house."
