"Fifteen gallons of ice cream, 600
cups of coffee, and 45 dozen rolls,
please."
A party in the offing? It could be,
but it isn't—it's simply a portion of
the menu served daily at the Cellar,
foremost of the Farm's summer
eating spots.
With the aid of the Cellar's two
cooks, supplemented by the four on
the Union staff, 15 student hashers,
and the remainder of the summer
staff of 42, the Cellar can replenish
the caloric content of its better than
1,000 daily customers with seldom a
slip betwixt the empty cup and the
satisfied customer, according to the
day manager of the institution, Miss
Doris Bradock.

Slips, as a matter of fact, are con
spicuous because of their absence
even on such a record day as when
1,606 orders were served during one
of Stanford's many conferences.
Although summer quarter busi
ness doesn't measure up to that of
the regular school year when 'after
libe' and 'coke' dates account for a
daily average of 7,500 cups of coffee
and 1,700 cokes, the number of meals
served falls off no more than 10 per
cent, Miss Bradock said.

Evidence pointing to more repre
sentatives of virile American man
hood among members of the Edu
cation Conference, using the old
American custom of a man-sized
breakfast as a criteria for judging,
is found in figures which indicate
481 breakfasts were served while
the conference was in session here.
Other "highs" were the 423 lunches
served when both the Education and
Business conferences were being
held on the campus, and total of
149 dinners served while the Teacher
Development was in session here.

481 breakfasts were served while
the conference was in session here.
Other "highs" were the 423 lunches
served when both the Education and
Business conferences were being
held on the campus, and total of
149 dinners served while the Teacher
Development was in session here.

Further indicators of the gastro
nomic pangs suffered by campus in
haibtants are the 30 pounds of but
ter, the 10 dozen eggs, 25 loaves of
bread, 400 glasses of milk, and the
140 glasses of orange juice con
sumed by the early risers, the late
retirers, and the ordinary John and
Jane Does who require their "cup of
coffee and a piece of pie, please,"
for lunch.
As much as possible of the food
served is bought locally, Miss Brad
ock said, but most of the bakery
products are made in the Encina
kitchens
"Fifteen gallons of ice cream, 600
cups of coffee, and 45 dozen rolls,
please."
A party in the offing? It could be,
but it isn't—it's simply a portion of
the menu served daily at the Cellar,
foremost of the Farm's summer
eating spots.
With the aid of the Cellar's two
cooks, supplemented by the four on
the Union staff, 15 student hashers,
and the remainder of the summer
staff of 42, the Cellar can replenish
the caloric content of its better than
1,000 daily customers with seldom a
slip betwixt the empty cup and the
satisfied customer, according to the
day manager of the institution, Miss
Doris Bradock.

Slips, as a matter of fact, are con
spicuous because of their absence
even on such a record day as when
1,606 orders were served during one
of Stanford's many conferences.
Although summer quarter busi
ness doesn't measure up to that of
the regular school year when 'after
libe' and 'coke' dates account for a
daily average of 7,500 cups of coffee
and 1,700 cokes, the number of meals
served falls off no more than 10 per
cent, Miss Bradock said.
