### DWIGHT MITCHELL 
Calm and quiet almost
like have settled over the School of
Education, only last week a scene
of bustling activity with busy pro
fessors driving through their final
words of wisdom, office workers
clearing up desks, and harried stu
dents scurrying to the cover of their
notebooks and texts in anticipation
of a bombing invasion of examina
tion questions.
Not all is quiet underneath, even
yet; faculty members are now the
ones on the spot, what with moun
tains of test papers and term re
ports to wade through and volumi
nous grade reports to file in the office
before they really heave sighs of
relief and say, "Well, vacation has
just this moment begun."
And the few stragglers: students
working on dissertations; students
who don't have to go back to their
teaching jobs at Podunk, Zenith or
Name-of-Place for a few days and
like the atmosphere here; students
who have to see Dr. So-and-So about
their programs for next summer;
students looking for a better job.
Yes, the School of Education is still
going, but it's mighty, mighty quiet.
* * *
And it's the time for caretakers of
the building to polish up the floors,
straighten out the furniture and do
whatever else caretakers have to do
to put the building in ship shape
for next fall.
But the quiet of the place is ac
centuated by the buzzing of a lone
fly in one of the offices and the faint
clickety-clack of a mowing machine
cutting weeds in the hayfield just
outside the windows of the Educa
tion Building.
Oh, yes, if this is so puzzling, the
explanation: final exams in the 1940
summer session were over last Sat
urday.

This column wouldn't be complete
without another story of a wedding
and still another of somebody get
ting out a book. Dr. Leo Cain, act
ing instructor in Education this
summer, and Miss Margaret Ben
nett of San Francisco, former Stan
ford student, were married Satur
day in San Francisco, and departed
by airplane for Seattle on their
honeymoon.
And the new book: Dr. Percy
Davidson, emeritus professor of edu
cation, is collaborator with Dr. H.
Dewey Anderson on a book entitled
"Occupational Trends," to be pub
lished by the Stanford University
Press next month. Dr. Anderson is a
former state relief administrator.
The book is intended for voca
tional guidance workers and all per
sons in general who are concerned

'with occupational problems. It deals,
said Dr. Davidson, with occupational
statistics for the years 1870-1930,
with further studies of the 1930'5.
Pi'ovision is made for supplemental
material covering results of the 1940
census, which is expected to be
available within a couple of years.
The book is the only one of its
kind to assemble and analyze voca
tional statistics for the 60 years cov
ered.

ing instructor in Education this
summer, and Miss Margaret Ben
nett of San Francisco, former Stan
ford student, were married Satur
day in San Francisco, and departed
by airplane for Seattle on their
honeymoon.
And the new book: Dr. Percy
Davidson, emeritus professor of edu
cation, is collaborator with Dr. H.
Dewey Anderson on a book entitled
"Occupational Trends," to be pub
lished by the Stanford University
Press next month. Dr. Anderson is a
former state relief administrator.
The book is intended for voca
tional guidance workers and all per
sons in general who are concerned

'with occupational problems. It deals,
said Dr. Davidson, with occupational
statistics for the years 1870-1930,
with further studies of the 1930'5.
Pi'ovision is made for supplemental
material covering results of the 1940
census, which is expected to be
available within a couple of years.
The book is the only one of its
kind to assemble and analyze voca
tional statistics for the 60 years cov
ered.
Calm and quiet almost
like have settled over the School of
Education, only last week a scene
of bustling activity with busy pro
fessors driving through their final
words of wisdom, office workers
clearing up desks, and harried stu
dents scurrying to the cover of their
notebooks and texts in anticipation
of a bombing invasion of examina
tion questions.
Not all is quiet underneath, even
yet; faculty members are now the
ones on the spot, what with moun
tains of test papers and term re
ports to wade through and volumi
nous grade reports to file in the office
before they really heave sighs of
relief and say, "Well, vacation has
just this moment begun."
And the few stragglers: students
working on dissertations; students
who don't have to go back to their
teaching jobs at Podunk, Zenith or
Name-of-Place for a few days and
like the atmosphere here; students
who have to see Dr. So-and-So about
their programs for next summer;
students looking for a better job.
Yes, the School of Education is still
going, but it's mighty, mighty quiet.
* * *
And it's the time for caretakers of
the building to polish up the floors,
straighten out the furniture and do
whatever else caretakers have to do
to put the building in ship shape
for next fall.
But the quiet of the place is ac
centuated by the buzzing of a lone
fly in one of the offices and the faint
clickety-clack of a mowing machine
cutting weeds in the hayfield just
outside the windows of the Educa
tion Building.
Oh, yes, if this is so puzzling, the
explanation: final exams in the 1940
summer session were over last Sat
urday.
