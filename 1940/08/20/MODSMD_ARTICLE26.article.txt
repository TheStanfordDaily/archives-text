# Anthiel Will Give Recital
## 
### 
The final musical offering for the
summer quarter sponsored by the
Division of Music will be a piano re
cital by George Antheil, composer
in-residence, tomorrow at 8 o'clock
in the auditorium of the Memorial
Theater.
Mr. Antheil will play some of his
piano works, "Sonata Savage," from
which the Ballet Mecanique style
emerged, and the first performance
of the new "Ballade" as well as some
new children's piano pieces.
He will also play a sort of "piano
sonata" of the new score for Ben
Hecht's new picture. There will be
other pieces, by Debussy and Shos
takovitch.
The public is invited.
