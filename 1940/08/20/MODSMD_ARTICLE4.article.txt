# Official Denies Water Myths
## Campus Excavations Not Due to Errors 
### 
Denying the ingenious myths con
cocted by Stanford students, A. L.
Trowbridge, assistant comptroller,
explained yesterday that the cam
pus excavations are mere routine
repair.
"Some of the pipe in the quad
water system is the original two
inch pipe installed 40 years ago," he
explained. "Naturally the rust and
deposits accumulated have reduced
the efficiency of the system. We are
replacing it wtih new four-inch
pipe."
The explanations contrived by
footweary summer students were
more picturesque but less accurate.
According to one rumor, the drink
ing and domestic water pipes had
been mixed, the chlorinated water
in the fountains properly belonging
on the plant life.
Another popular version inferred
that the only man knowing the loca
tion of the water system had re
cently died, taking his secret with
him. His untimely death entailed
the excavation of the whole quad in
order to discover the missing pipe
line.
