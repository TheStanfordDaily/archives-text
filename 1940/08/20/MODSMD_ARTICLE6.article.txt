# Circle's Oak And Flagpole Doomed
## 
### 
Yesterday, much to the despair of
people who have often stood wait
ing for busses on the Circle, the old
oak tree which has stood there for
many years was chopped down.
Next to go is the famous flagpole,
standing right near the oak, which,
at one time, was the loftiest flag
pole in the state. It was erected at
least 25 years ago by the Native
Sons of the Golden West.
