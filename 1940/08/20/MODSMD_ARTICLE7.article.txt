# Suspicion, Fear, Bane Of Industry
## Lescohier Discusses Labor Policy In Public Relations 
### 
Dr. Don D. Lescohier, of the Uni
versity of Wisconsin, presented the
case for an adequate labor policy to
the short course in Public Relations
yesterday afternoon.
The fact that all leading indus
trialists are afraid of labor and labor
unions is counteracted by the fear
of the employers by labor, said Dr.
Lescohier. This mutual distrust can
be erased if the labor policy is
clearly defined into a comprehensive
and clean-cut program. Dr. Lesco
hier said this policy must be known
by all that are in a position to exe
cute it.
Asserting that suspicion, which
has been derived from fear and mis
understanding, is the bane of the in
dustrial world, Dr. Lescohier de
clared that analyzing, planning, and
performing were going to be neces
sary.
NAZI PROPAGANDA
Making a study of the Nazi plan
of propaganda, Dr. Harwood Childs,
of Princeton University, declared
that the National Socialists have
taken a great deal from the proven
successfulness of the American plan
of advertising and incorporated it
into their propagandizing system.
In 1931, Dr. Childs was in Ger
many to study pressure groups and
met the Nazis before they came into
power. He left just before the nam
ing of Hitler to the chancellorship in
1933. When he returned in 1937 to
conclude his study, he found a com
plete change.
"By 1937 the regime of pressure
groups had been turned into a re
gime of political pressure," he said.
"Propaganda," he said, is a char
acteristic of the age in which we
live. This is an era of conflicting
ideologies."
Dr. Childs pointed out that the
Nazis have drawn heavily from the
Communist and Catholic methods of
propagandizing. That the Nazis
would go to Communism for in
struction can be explained, accord
ing to Dr. Childs, by the fact that
most of the top National Socialists
were at one time Communists.
The Germans have established, he
said, the greatest propaganda ma
chine in history. In Berlin, Dr.
Childs continued, all Germans going
abroad are thoroughly inoculated
with the primary philosophy of the
party. This is done by means of a
school for travelers, and is for the
avowed purpose of spreading the
Nazi doctrine.
CONTROL COMMUNICATION
He showed that the Department of
Propaganda and Enlightenment has
very little to do with actual propa
gandizing. Their task is to control
all media of communication, thus
