# U.S. Chemists Discover New Superchemical
## Fieser Announces Steroid Family At Chemistry Confab 
### 
Discovery by American chemists
of the most amazing family of
"super-chemicals" in history was
claimed by Dr. L. I. Fieser of Har
vard University before the Organic
Chemistry Research Conference held
on the campus Tuesday.
Such potent substances as vita
min D, snake poisons, male and fe
male sex hormones, cancer-produc
ing agents, opium constituents and
hormones used to prevent Addison's
disease are included in this new
chemical family, which is now known
as the steroid.
FORMULA CAN BE WRITTEN
The chemical formula for almost
all of these intricate substances can
now be written, and samples syn
thesized in the laboratory, Dr.
Fieser declared. One female hor
mone has been obtained from a
component of soy beans. Another, a
sex hormone, has been synthesized
simply from coal and natural gas.
A new potential vitamin, possess
ing the qualities of both vitamin E
and vitamin K, has been separated
out, according to Dr. Fieser. Vitamin
E protects muscles, while vitamin K
prevents hemorrhage in some forms.
As vitamin K has been already arti
ficially produced in the laboratory,
the possibility of synthesizing the
new vitamin seems good.
Referring to the new steroid fam
ily, Dr. Fieser said: "We want to
know more about the relationship
between their chemical structure and
the effect they have on the body. We
also want to know whether or not
we can prepare these synthetic hor
mones on such a scale that they can
be used in medicine."
CANCER SOURCE SOUGHT
The source of the cancer-producing
hormone in the human body is still
the source of extensive investigation
and controversy, Dr. Fieser declared.
Some scientists believe that it is
formed from normal sex hormones
when bodily processes are suffi
ciently disturbed. Other investiga
tors point to the destruction of bod
ily balances of sugars or fats as the
true source.
Other steroid compounds can be
changed into the cancer-producing
hormone "in the test tube"; but
whether this same effect could be
produced in the human body is not
known.

GRADE ENVELOPES READY
Students who wish to receive
their grades for Summer Quarter
should leave a stamped, self-ad
dressed envelope at the informa
tion window at the Registrar's of
fice before the end of the quarter.
For the convenience of students,
envelopes will he sold at the Reg
istrar's Ollice for 5 cents each.
The money received for these en
velopes is turned over to the Stan
ford Convalescent Home for
children.

be used in medicine."
CANCER SOURCE SOUGHT
The source of the cancer-producing
hormone in the human body is still
the source of extensive investigation
and controversy, Dr. Fieser declared.
Some scientists believe that it is
formed from normal sex hormones
when bodily processes are suffi
ciently disturbed. Other investiga
tors point to the destruction of bod
ily balances of sugars or fats as the
true source.
Other steroid compounds can be
changed into the cancer-producing
hormone "in the test tube"; but
whether this same effect could be
produced in the human body is not
known.

GRADE ENVELOPES READY
Students who wish to receive
their grades for Summer Quarter
should leave a stamped, self-ad
dressed envelope at the informa
tion window at the Registrar's of
fice before the end of the quarter.
For the convenience of students,
envelopes will he sold at the Reg
istrar's Ollice for 5 cents each.
The money received for these en
velopes is turned over to the Stan
ford Convalescent Home for
children.
Discovery by American chemists
of the most amazing family of
"super-chemicals" in history was
claimed by Dr. L. I. Fieser of Har
vard University before the Organic
Chemistry Research Conference held
on the campus Tuesday.
Such potent substances as vita
min D, snake poisons, male and fe
male sex hormones, cancer-produc
ing agents, opium constituents and
hormones used to prevent Addison's
disease are included in this new
chemical family, which is now known
as the steroid.
FORMULA CAN BE WRITTEN
The chemical formula for almost
all of these intricate substances can
now be written, and samples syn
thesized in the laboratory, Dr.
Fieser declared. One female hor
mone has been obtained from a
component of soy beans. Another, a
sex hormone, has been synthesized
simply from coal and natural gas.
A new potential vitamin, possess
ing the qualities of both vitamin E
and vitamin K, has been separated
out, according to Dr. Fieser. Vitamin
E protects muscles, while vitamin K
prevents hemorrhage in some forms.
As vitamin K has been already arti
ficially produced in the laboratory,
the possibility of synthesizing the
new vitamin seems good.
Referring to the new steroid fam
ily, Dr. Fieser said: "We want to
know more about the relationship
between their chemical structure and
the effect they have on the body. We
also want to know whether or not
we can prepare these synthetic hor
mones on such a scale that they can
be used in medicine."
