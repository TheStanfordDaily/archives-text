No nationwide headlines, no jam
packed stadiums, no rallies, no
bands, not even a ticket of admis
sion, yet Stanford had a sports pro
gram, and Stanford had its sports
stars during summer quarter.
In reviewing this summer's sports
calendar we find that at Evanston,
111., way back in June, Stanford
thinclads helped their Pacific Coast
fellow-stars beat the Big Ten 96-
40 by contributing four firsts and two
seconds in individual competition,
and furnishing the anchor man on
the mile relay team.
After this triumph over the boys
from the tall corn states, Farm track
men returned home, where, compet
ing for the winged-O, they were
able to do their bit to help win the
Fresno relays for their sponsoring
club.
Stan Anderson, hefty shot man,
was able to finish second to A1
Blozis of Georgetown U. Paul Moore,
Stanford distance man and holder
of the world's 1320-yard record, fin
ished third to Glenn Cunningham,
the Old Man of the Mile, who took
second to Walter Nehl's first.
Stanford held her own in tennis,
Larry Dee and Jim Wade succeed
ing in winning the doubles crown at
the National Intercollegiate tennis
matches at Haverford, Pa.
On the home front, Bud Finger
won the annual Stanford Invitational
golf tourney.
Headed by Czar Harry Shipkey,
the Wheel Chair League finally got
under way with its full quota of 12
"teams." Starting out on top and
managing to stay there by eating
their vitamins and clams were the
lads from Oregon, the Sparducks.
They were menaced only by the
Agonists, who hovered nearby all
season and finally tottered into the
finals only to lose to the Oregonians
4-3 in a thriller-diller.
