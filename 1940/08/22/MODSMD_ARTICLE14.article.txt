# Coach Shaughnessy to Fit System to Players on Hand
## 
### 
When "Tiny" Thornhill stepped out of the Stanford football picture last
fall there passed with him a famed football style which has characterized
Cardinal grid teams for the past decade and a half—the Warner system.
Replacing it in 1940 will be a system without a name, introduced by
Clark D. Shaughnessy, former head coach of the University of Chicago and

one of football's great strategists,<
who was named last January to the
Farm's head coaching job, replacing
Thornhill.
Shaughnessy brings with him no
glorified system such as the Rockne,
the Jones, or Stanford's own cele
brated Warner, for he is not a be
liever in following a set system re
gardless of available material.
Rather is it his idea to shape the
plays and the system to the abilities
and limitations of the players at
hand.
RED MACHINE'S FAST
Judging from last spring's final
two-hour football session, in which
Shaughnessy sent four separate
teams into action, the Big Red Ma
chine of 1940 will be the trickiest the
Farm has seen in many a day.
Speed will be the keynote of the
Indian attack, with a fast-charging
line opening up lightning-quick
holes through which speedy backs
will dart. There will be little use of
two lineman on a single opposing
player. This year it will be tackle
against tackle and end against end.
The emphasis will be on momentary
contact sufficient to permit the In
dian backs to scoot through the hole
and be on their way into the sec
ondary.
TOUGH SCHEDULE
Coach Shaughnessy steps into no
easy schedule this fall, by the way.
From the opener with the Univer
sity of San Francisco in the double
header at Kezar, to the year's finale
against California, Clark and his
crew will have their work cut out
for them.
Shaughnessy's fame as a mentor
capable of making more than the
most out of his material, plus the
incentive of a new deal all around,
plus the encouraging spring exhibi
tion, all add up to a promising sea
son for Indian football fortunes.
Too much cannot be expected of
an untried football team working
with a new system, but Stanford
adherents look for a tricky, fast
stepping, interesting ball club to
represent them against Pacific Coast
Conference opposition this fall.
STANDLEE WILL LEAD
The Indians will be led by "Big
Chief" Norm Standlee, 225-pounds
of fast and powerful fullback. Stand
lee will be playing his third season,
and is favorably mentioned for all-
Coast and possible all-American
honors. His amazing exhibitions of
punting, passing, and running, which
featured the spring practices and
revealed him as something more
than a line-crashing fullback, should
bid fair to rank him as the top back
field man on the Coast.
The remainder of the backfield will
probably be veteran, with southpaw
Frankie Albert, and the speedy
Hugh Gallarneau and Pete Kmeto
vic holding down the other three
berths. Pushing them for their jobs
will be sophomores Cole, Vucinich,
and Taylor.
SOPHOMORES SHINE
Judging from the fine performance

►
of the sophomore line last spring, it
will not be at all unlikely to find
some of them shouldering their way
into the starting front wall. Ed
Stamm and Hank Norberg, two hus
kies built more along the lines of
tackles, are two of the best-looking
ends the Farm has seen since Top
ping and Moscrip of Vow Boy fame.
McCain and Palmer, tackles, and
Banducci and Mannon, guards, are
other first year men being consid
ered for first-string jobs.
Veterans returning include Freddie
Meyer and Stan Graff, ends, Doug
Stahle, Colin McClintock, and Jim
Verdieck, centers, and Ken Robesky
and Bill Braheny, guards.

ends the Farm has seen since Top
ping and Moscrip of Vow Boy fame.

The Pennsylvania State College
School of Engineering has announced
a general revision of its curricula to
effect increased thoroughness of
learning, concentration on essential
subject-matter, and greater emphasis
on science and the humanities.
When "Tiny" Thornhill stepped out of the Stanford football picture last
fall there passed with him a famed football style which has characterized
Cardinal grid teams for the past decade and a half—the Warner system.
Replacing it in 1940 will be a system without a name, introduced by
Clark D. Shaughnessy, former head coach of the University of Chicago and

one of football's great strategists,<
who was named last January to the
Farm's head coaching job, replacing
Thornhill.
Shaughnessy brings with him no
glorified system such as the Rockne,
the Jones, or Stanford's own cele
brated Warner, for he is not a be
liever in following a set system re
gardless of available material.
Rather is it his idea to shape the
plays and the system to the abilities
and limitations of the players at
hand.
RED MACHINE'S FAST
Judging from last spring's final
two-hour football session, in which
Shaughnessy sent four separate
teams into action, the Big Red Ma
chine of 1940 will be the trickiest the
Farm has seen in many a day.
Speed will be the keynote of the
Indian attack, with a fast-charging
line opening up lightning-quick
holes through which speedy backs
will dart. There will be little use of
two lineman on a single opposing
player. This year it will be tackle
against tackle and end against end.
The emphasis will be on momentary
contact sufficient to permit the In
dian backs to scoot through the hole
and be on their way into the sec
ondary.
TOUGH SCHEDULE
Coach Shaughnessy steps into no
easy schedule this fall, by the way.
From the opener with the Univer
sity of San Francisco in the double
header at Kezar, to the year's finale
against California, Clark and his
crew will have their work cut out
for them.
Shaughnessy's fame as a mentor
capable of making more than the
most out of his material, plus the
incentive of a new deal all around,
plus the encouraging spring exhibi
tion, all add up to a promising sea
son for Indian football fortunes.
Too much cannot be expected of
an untried football team working
with a new system, but Stanford
adherents look for a tricky, fast
stepping, interesting ball club to
represent them against Pacific Coast
Conference opposition this fall.
STANDLEE WILL LEAD
The Indians will be led by "Big
Chief" Norm Standlee, 225-pounds
of fast and powerful fullback. Stand
lee will be playing his third season,
and is favorably mentioned for all-
Coast and possible all-American
honors. His amazing exhibitions of
punting, passing, and running, which
featured the spring practices and
revealed him as something more
than a line-crashing fullback, should
bid fair to rank him as the top back
field man on the Coast.
The remainder of the backfield will
probably be veteran, with southpaw
Frankie Albert, and the speedy
Hugh Gallarneau and Pete Kmeto
vic holding down the other three
berths. Pushing them for their jobs
will be sophomores Cole, Vucinich,
and Taylor.

of the sophomore line last spring, it

field man on the Coast.
The remainder of the backfield will
probably be veteran, with southpaw
Frankie Albert, and the speedy
Hugh Gallarneau and Pete Kmeto
vic holding down the other three
berths. Pushing them for their jobs
will be sophomores Cole, Vucinich,
and Taylor.
SOPHOMORES SHINE
Judging from the fine performance

►
of the sophomore line last spring, it
will not be at all unlikely to find
some of them shouldering their way
into the starting front wall. Ed
Stamm and Hank Norberg, two hus
kies built more along the lines of
tackles, are two of the best-looking
ends the Farm has seen since Top
ping and Moscrip of Vow Boy fame.
McCain and Palmer, tackles, and
Banducci and Mannon, guards, are
other first year men being consid
ered for first-string jobs.
Veterans returning include Freddie
Meyer and Stan Graff, ends, Doug
Stahle, Colin McClintock, and Jim
Verdieck, centers, and Ken Robesky
and Bill Braheny, guards.

When "Tiny" Thornhill stepped out of the Stanford football picture last
fall there passed with him a famed football style which has characterized
Cardinal grid teams for the past decade and a half—the Warner system.
Replacing it in 1940 will be a system without a name, introduced by
Clark D. Shaughnessy, former head coach of the University of Chicago and

one of football's great strategists,<
who was named last January to the
Farm's head coaching job, replacing
Thornhill.
Shaughnessy brings with him no
glorified system such as the Rockne,
the Jones, or Stanford's own cele
brated Warner, for he is not a be
liever in following a set system re
gardless of available material.
Rather is it his idea to shape the
plays and the system to the abilities
and limitations of the players at
hand.
RED MACHINE'S FAST
Judging from last spring's final
two-hour football session, in which
Shaughnessy sent four separate
teams into action, the Big Red Ma
chine of 1940 will be the trickiest the
Farm has seen in many a day.
Speed will be the keynote of the
Indian attack, with a fast-charging
line opening up lightning-quick
holes through which speedy backs
will dart. There will be little use of
two lineman on a single opposing
player. This year it will be tackle
against tackle and end against end.
The emphasis will be on momentary
contact sufficient to permit the In
dian backs to scoot through the hole
and be on their way into the sec
ondary.
TOUGH SCHEDULE
Coach Shaughnessy steps into no
easy schedule this fall, by the way.
From the opener with the Univer
sity of San Francisco in the double
header at Kezar, to the year's finale
against California, Clark and his
crew will have their work cut out
for them.
Shaughnessy's fame as a mentor
capable of making more than the
most out of his material, plus the
incentive of a new deal all around,
plus the encouraging spring exhibi
tion, all add up to a promising sea
son for Indian football fortunes.
Too much cannot be expected of
an untried football team working
with a new system, but Stanford
adherents look for a tricky, fast
stepping, interesting ball club to
represent them against Pacific Coast
Conference opposition this fall.
STANDLEE WILL LEAD
The Indians will be led by "Big
Chief" Norm Standlee, 225-pounds
of fast and powerful fullback. Stand
lee will be playing his third season,
and is favorably mentioned for all-
Coast and possible all-American
honors. His amazing exhibitions of
punting, passing, and running, which
featured the spring practices and
revealed him as something more
than a line-crashing fullback, should
bid fair to rank him as the top back
field man on the Coast.
The remainder of the backfield will
probably be veteran, with southpaw
Frankie Albert, and the speedy
Hugh Gallarneau and Pete Kmeto
vic holding down the other three
berths. Pushing them for their jobs
will be sophomores Cole, Vucinich,
and Taylor.
