Education faculty members off<
duty during the fall quarter will in
clude Dr. John Almack, Dr. Paul R.
Hanna, Associate Professor Holland
D. Roberts, and Associate Professor
I. James Quillen. Professor Roberts
is planning to engage in graduate
study at Teachers College, Columbia
University, and Quillen will study at
Yale.
♦ * ♦
On sabbatical leave for the coming
year are two Education faculty
members: Professor Verna A. Car
ley, director of teacher training, and
Professor Ernest R. Hilgard. Dr.
Carley, president of the National As
sociation of Supervisors of Teacher
Training, is now with a "traveling
seminar" visiting social projects in
the South. She has been spending
the summer in Wisconsin. The
darned old war has interfered with
an idea she had of a bit of travel
abroad.
* * *
Maybe evex-ybody else knows all
about this, but the author of these
Scopes Etc. (Inc. and Ltd.) found
out that there is more to library
procedures than meets the casual
eye. About cataloguing books, for
instance, as reported last week in
our modest little interview with

►Stanford's distinguished emeritus
dean of the School of Education, Dr.
Elwood Patterson Cubberley: well,
as explained by Bibliographer Wini
fred Webster, recataloguing (or re
catalogueing if you wish) is only a
part of the process of, er—well, mak
ing over all the catalogue files, re
fining the numbering of books and
so on.
* * *
Incidentally, since "recatalogue" is
a long word, when you talk with a
librarian, try saying "recat."
Then there is so darn much con
centrated information on a catalogue
card. Ever notice all those numbers
in fine print at the bottom? Every
number means something, by Jove.
Librarians will explain it all if you
ask them when they aren't too busy;
but you won't understand and re
member all they explain unless
you're a better man than we are,
Gunga Din.
* * *
Anyway, the reclassifying of the
entire Education library is going
right ahead, even though summer
quarter is over for the educators.

Harbingers of the fall quarter:
caretakers cleaning up the Education
Building; students coming in to get

enrollment over early; students
checking on requirements for cre
dentials; office workers on their
vacations.
* ♦ *
Truck backed up to a door in the
rear of the Education building; Pro
fessor Reginald Bell and Graduate
Students Glenn Max figuring out the
best way to load into it a small
mountain of boxes of books and
other stuff. All because Dr. Harold
Hand has gone to Maryland Univer
sity and some of his friends here are
shipping his property back there. We
cal'late that's another harbinger of
fall.

fall.
Education faculty members off<
duty during the fall quarter will in
clude Dr. John Almack, Dr. Paul R.
Hanna, Associate Professor Holland
D. Roberts, and Associate Professor
I. James Quillen. Professor Roberts
is planning to engage in graduate
study at Teachers College, Columbia
University, and Quillen will study at
Yale.
♦ * ♦
On sabbatical leave for the coming
year are two Education faculty
members: Professor Verna A. Car
ley, director of teacher training, and
Professor Ernest R. Hilgard. Dr.
Carley, president of the National As
sociation of Supervisors of Teacher
Training, is now with a "traveling
seminar" visiting social projects in
the South. She has been spending
the summer in Wisconsin. The
darned old war has interfered with
an idea she had of a bit of travel
abroad.
* * *
Maybe evex-ybody else knows all
about this, but the author of these
Scopes Etc. (Inc. and Ltd.) found
out that there is more to library
procedures than meets the casual
eye. About cataloguing books, for
instance, as reported last week in
our modest little interview with

►Stanford's distinguished emeritus
dean of the School of Education, Dr.
Elwood Patterson Cubberley: well,
as explained by Bibliographer Wini
fred Webster, recataloguing (or re
catalogueing if you wish) is only a
part of the process of, er—well, mak
ing over all the catalogue files, re
fining the numbering of books and
so on.
* * *
Incidentally, since "recatalogue" is
a long word, when you talk with a
librarian, try saying "recat."
Then there is so darn much con
centrated information on a catalogue
card. Ever notice all those numbers
in fine print at the bottom? Every
number means something, by Jove.
Librarians will explain it all if you
ask them when they aren't too busy;
but you won't understand and re
member all they explain unless
you're a better man than we are,
Gunga Din.
* * *
Anyway, the reclassifying of the
entire Education library is going
right ahead, even though summer
quarter is over for the educators.
* * ♦
Harbingers of the fall quarter:
caretakers cleaning up the Education
Building; students coming in to get

enrollment over early; students
checking on requirements for cre
dentials; office workers on their
vacations.
* ♦ *
Truck backed up to a door in the
rear of the Education building; Pro
fessor Reginald Bell and Graduate
Students Glenn Max figuring out the
best way to load into it a small
mountain of boxes of books and
other stuff. All because Dr. Harold
Hand has gone to Maryland Univer
sity and some of his friends here are
shipping his property back there. We
cal'late that's another harbinger of
fall.
