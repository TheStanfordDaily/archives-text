Fajama-clad frosh stage their traditional
torchlight parade from the Pavilion to
Roble, where they serenade the women,
then ride to Palo Alto for a free show the
night before the S.C. game. Major freshman
task is to construct the gigantic pyre that
burns the Berkeley Bear at the Big Game
rally.
Stanford's gridiron hopes rest with the
Farm's new head coach, Clark Shaugh
nessy, and his tribe of Indians, already
capering around the practice field in prep
aration for their opening tilt with the Uni
versity of San Francisco in Kezar Stadium
on September 28. A stiff schedule, this
year's slate will culminate in the trek to
Berkeley on November 30 to meet the Cali
fornia Bears. a

/o a thousand new Stanford men and women, the bewildering whirl of autumn
quarter presents no dominant pattern. Stepping from the comparative security of
home, or at least from the reasonable familiarity of another scholastic background,
into the heart of a great resident University necessitates adjustments to a differ
ently keyed way of life.
When the first crew of freshmen trudge up the sandstone steps of Encina,
struggle with the gigantic black door, and push their suitcases and duffle bags
into the bare, newly painted interior of its lobby they will begin the first day of
a complex, community existence. A similar experience awaits each freshman
woman who, in the next few days, will unpack in a crowded Roble room.
In the next few days, though, new arrivals will probably form one dominant idea of Stanford
—that the Farm is friendly. People like each other. They say "hello." This University, in con
trast to so many, is a democratic place. Stanford's democracy is no myth—it's true.

And it s the common bond of friendship, tormed in
Encina and Roble, that helps to keep Stanford the demo
cratic place it is, unique among major American univer
sities. »
After variously assorted preregistration committees
have ushered embryo Stanfordites through the horrors
of Registration day, the tyros will be left to fend for them
selves in the Farm's "collegiate" autumn quarter, brist
ling with undergraduate activity.
They will find little trouble in entering the swing of
studies and relaxation. Rallies, rooting-sections, plays,
parades, and hours in the library and lecture rooms will
fit into the picture. And the Senator's Farm, all 9,000
acres of it stretching up toward the Skyline, will seem
a little unreal, a strange, magic land where each new
event is a fresh experience with a meaning all its own.
To the veterans who have had a host of encounters
with that "Make All Checks Payable" sign above the
Registrar's window, another year on the Farm is an old
experience, though by no means completely predictable.
Each swiftly paced year adds a flavor and depth to uni
versity life. Stanford, somehow, grows and unfolds.
But for the present, the classes of '41, '42, and '43 step
back a little bit to make room for a newcomer, and to
offer a handshake to '44.

/o a thousand new Stanford men and women, the bewildering whirl of autumn
quarter presents no dominant pattern. Stepping from the comparative security of
home, or at least from the reasonable familiarity of another scholastic background,
into the heart of a great resident University necessitates adjustments to a differ
ently keyed way of life.
When the first crew of freshmen trudge up the sandstone steps of Encina,
struggle with the gigantic black door, and push their suitcases and duffle bags
into the bare, newly painted interior of its lobby they will begin the first day of
a complex, community existence. A similar experience awaits each freshman
woman who, in the next few days, will unpack in a crowded Roble room.
In the next few days, though, new arrivals will probably form one dominant idea of Stanford
—that the Farm is friendly. People like each other. They say "hello." This University, in con
trast to so many, is a democratic place. Stanford's democracy is no myth—it's true.

And it s the common bond of friendship, tormed in
Encina and Roble, that helps to keep Stanford the demo
cratic place it is, unique among major American univer
sities. »
After variously assorted preregistration committees
have ushered embryo Stanfordites through the horrors
of Registration day, the tyros will be left to fend for them
selves in the Farm's "collegiate" autumn quarter, brist
ling with undergraduate activity.
They will find little trouble in entering the swing of
studies and relaxation. Rallies, rooting-sections, plays,
parades, and hours in the library and lecture rooms will
fit into the picture. And the Senator's Farm, all 9,000
acres of it stretching up toward the Skyline, will seem
a little unreal, a strange, magic land where each new
event is a fresh experience with a meaning all its own.
To the veterans who have had a host of encounters
with that "Make All Checks Payable" sign above the
Registrar's window, another year on the Farm is an old
experience, though by no means completely predictable.
Each swiftly paced year adds a flavor and depth to uni
versity life. Stanford, somehow, grows and unfolds.
But for the present, the classes of '41, '42, and '43 step
back a little bit to make room for a newcomer, and to
offer a handshake to '44.
