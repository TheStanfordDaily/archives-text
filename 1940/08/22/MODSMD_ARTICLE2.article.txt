# Hitler Perverts Youth's Ideals
## Dr. Becker, on KPO, Tells Nazi Doctrine 
### 
"The generation of youth which is
arising to adulthood in Germany to
day has been infused for seven years
with a single set of uncontradicted
doctrines, revolving about one simple
ideal —service to the fatherland," said
Dr. Howard Becker speaking on
"The Rise and Transformation of the
German Youth Movement" last night
from station KPO on the Stanford
University—On the Air program.
Dr. Becker is visiting professor of
sociology at Stanford and professor
of sociology and anthropology at the
University of Wisconsin.
YOUTH MOVEMENT PERVERTED
The leaders of the Nazi regime
have preserved the outward form of
many traditional patterns, at the
same time changing their intent
without the knowledge of the public,
Dr. Becker said. He cited Hitler's
perversion of the old German youth
movement as an example.
"It was easy for Hitler to organize
a nation on the principle of leader
ship," said Dr. Becker, "since tens of
thousands of Germans had at some
time in their lives been exposed to
the same type of domination in their
youth movement experiences."
Dr. Becker observed that the nov
elty of most of the forms introduced
by Hitler is only apparent, and that
back of each of them in almost every
case lie behavior patterns which are
deeply embedded in the customs of
the country.
