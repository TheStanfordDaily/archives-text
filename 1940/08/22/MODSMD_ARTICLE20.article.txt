# The 						Farm Slumbers Thru Late Summer

### 
When the last summer quarter Blue Book is
closed and the last professor has deserted the
campus for the mountains or beach, the Farm
settles down for a snooze before the influx of
regular students.
From the tower of the Hoover War Library,
The Daily cameraman looks down on a silent
quadrangle, forsaken except for workmen re
pairing tiles atop sun-drenched roofs. In his of
fice in Old Union, Dick Stepp, student manager
and one of the first to arrive, pores over Asso
ciated Students accounts.
Alone and abandoned, a dusty ticket office
stands beside the Stadium, awaiting the throngs
that will soon line up before its green and cardi
nal window. And History Corner, on a drowsy
afternoon, contemplates an impending year that
will never bring such strange peace to its steps.
