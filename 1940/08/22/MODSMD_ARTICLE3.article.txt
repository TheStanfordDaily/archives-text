# Director Shows Hospital Needs
## MacLean Says Worst Problem Is Service 
### 
Dr. Basil C. Mac Lean, director of
the Strong Memorial Hospital in
Rochester, New York, spoke Tues
day to the Western Hospital Admin
istrator's Institute on the paramount
problems facing the hospital admin
istrators of our nation today.
The main problem confronting the
modern hospitals, he said, is the ex
panding demand for service in all
branches of the institutions because
of the group hospitalization plans
that are in existence all over the
country.
The second problem is that of per
sonnel. The stafTs of the hospitals
are being cramped and rushed be
cause of the demands made upon
them as part of the nation's defense
plan, he said.
Not only are some of the doctors
going into the medical corps of the
army and navy, but conscription is a
threat to those of the staff who are
working in semi-skilled fields but
are t very necessary part of the
staff.
WAR AFFECTS NURSING
Nursing, continued Dr. Mac Lean,
; has 11 ready been greatly affected by
the war, airlines, etc., in some parts
j of the country. Hospitals in these
sections will be using practical
nurses in the future with the regis
tered nurses acting as supervisors.
At the present the Institute of Hos
pital Administrators is conducting a
survey of the personnel in the west
ern states. It is endeavoring to de
termine how many people will be
needed to staff the hospitals effec
tively, while other hospitals are
studying the question of operating
with reduced staffs.
Last week in a discussion along the
same lines, Miss Folendorf, of the
Shriners Hospital for Crippled Chil
dren in San Francisco, stated there
is no pinch felt in the employment
of the registered nurses because of
the call of the Red Cross and the
Army.
The national defense program
calls for expansion in the classes for
the nurses' hospitals, she said. Al
though these nurses are not needed
in the West, the measure is precau
tionary in case of a national emer
gency.
The rest of the day was spent in
discussing problems of nursing per
sonnel in hospitals with Mrs. J. F.
Korngold, director of nurses at
Fresno General Hospital, outlining
the recent trends in educational re
quirements for nurses.
The Board of Athletic Control was
organized in 1917.

though these nurses are not needed
in the West, the measure is precau
tionary in case of a national emer
gency.
The rest of the day was spent in
discussing problems of nursing per
sonnel in hospitals with Mrs. J. F.
Korngold, director of nurses at
Fresno General Hospital, outlining
the recent trends in educational re
quirements for nurses.
The Board of Athletic Control was

Dr. Basil C. Mac Lean, director of
the Strong Memorial Hospital in
Rochester, New York, spoke Tues
day to the Western Hospital Admin
istrator's Institute on the paramount
problems facing the hospital admin
istrators of our nation today.
The main problem confronting the
modern hospitals, he said, is the ex
panding demand for service in all
branches of the institutions because
of the group hospitalization plans
that are in existence all over the
country.
The second problem is that of per
sonnel. The stafTs of the hospitals
are being cramped and rushed be
cause of the demands made upon
them as part of the nation's defense
plan, he said.
Not only are some of the doctors
going into the medical corps of the
army and navy, but conscription is a
threat to those of the staff who are
working in semi-skilled fields but
are t very necessary part of the
staff.
WAR AFFECTS NURSING
Nursing, continued Dr. Mac Lean,
; has 11 ready been greatly affected by
the war, airlines, etc., in some parts
j of the country. Hospitals in these
sections will be using practical
nurses in the future with the regis
tered nurses acting as supervisors.
At the present the Institute of Hos
pital Administrators is conducting a
survey of the personnel in the west
ern states. It is endeavoring to de
termine how many people will be
needed to staff the hospitals effec
tively, while other hospitals are
studying the question of operating
with reduced staffs.
Last week in a discussion along the
same lines, Miss Folendorf, of the
Shriners Hospital for Crippled Chil
dren in San Francisco, stated there
is no pinch felt in the employment
of the registered nurses because of
the call of the Red Cross and the
Army.
The national defense program
calls for expansion in the classes for
the nurses' hospitals, she said. Al
though these nurses are not needed
in the West, the measure is precau
tionary in case of a national emer
gency.
