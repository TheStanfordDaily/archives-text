# 5000 Heard Concert Series This Summer, Reports Mears
## 
### DR. ELIOT G. MEARS 
Director of the Summer Quarter
In response to a request from The
Stanford Daily, I am glad to review
the activities of the summer session
which is nearly at an end. May I
take the opportunity at this juncture
to express my thanks to the Daily
for its careful and timely reporting
of campus events.
Although the actual enrollment is
somewhat less than last year, the
quarter has been decidedly worth
while because of the quality of work
accomplished. In addition, confer
ences, musical and dramatic events,
church and vesper services, special
lectures, sports, and dances have all
contributed to that rich and well
rounded life which is so noteworthy
a characteristic of each Stanford
summer quarter.
CONCERTS WERE POPULAR
Approximately five thousand peo
ple from the University community,
Palo Alto, and the Peninsula heard
the series of four concerts of
Beethoven sonatas presented at
Stanford on August 6, 9, 13 and 20.
The artists participating were Miss
Sylvia Lent, violinist; Mr. Victor
Gottlieb and Mr. Warwick Evans,
'cellists; and Mr. Gunnar Johansen,
pianist. To the Elizabeth Sprague
Coolidge Foundation in the Library
of Congress and the Stanford Friends
of Music, we are deeply indebted for
these evenings of rare musical
pleasure.
CONFERENCES SWAMP CAMPUS
Another important part of this
summer has been the conferences
which have brought to the campus
teachers, journalists, business men,
radio executives, hospital admin
istrators, public relations experts,
and chemists. Last week three of
these were meeting simultaneously:
the Dramatists' Alliance, the Hospi
tal Administrators, and the Public
Relations Institute. At the present
time, both the Public Relations In
stitute and the Organic Chemistry
Conference are in session on the
campus.
A conference which met this year
for the first time, on Radio and Edu
cation, was unusually stimulating.
The meeting was under the joint
sponsorship of Stanford University
and the Federal Radio Education
Committee, with participants from
the federal government, educational
institutions and all the leading
broadcasting chains. Professional
concerts of the highest character and
significant conferences are leading
features of the summer session at
Stanford. Deserving of mention,

also, are the activities of the Drama
itsts' Alliance, now in its third year,
which has presented lectures and
play readings in connection with its
annual awards in dramatic compo
sition.
FARM LOOKS FORWARD TO '41
An outstanding evidence of mate
rial progress on the campus is the
new Hoover Library on War, Revo
lution, and Peace, which will be fin
ished early next year and formally
dedicated during the ceremonial
next summer.
Stanford University extends its
friendly good wishes to the visiting
faculty members and summer quar
ter students who are now leaving
the campus. We are glad to have
had thein here and we hope that
they may return. I am happy to
assure them that in the midst of a
confused and confusing world, Stan
ford is looking forward confidently
to the commemoration of its fiftieth
anniversary in 1940-41 and to the
beginning of its second fifty years of
educational service. The activities
in connection with this commemora
tion will extend over much of 1941,
but the concentrated period will be
during the summer. Finally, I want
to thank the members of the regular
University staff, faculty, and stu
dents who have co-operated to make
this summer quarter of 1940 one
which we may recall with satisfac
tion.
