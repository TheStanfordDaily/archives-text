# Consumer Polls Gaining Favor, Says Crossley
## Market Expert Tells Short Course About Opinion Sampling 
### 
"Americans are incredibly gullible
—for a time," Archibald M. Crossley,
president of Crossley, Incorporated,
nationally known research organiza
tion, told members of the short
course in Public Relations yester
day.
"I know, because I live in Prince
ton, where Wells' 'Martian Invasion'
supposedly took place," he said.
Americans have never hesitated to
express their opinions, and as a re

opinion are becoming of increasing
importance, Mr. Crossley asserted.
CONSUMER OPINION VITAL
"A number of the largest manu
facturers scarcely turn a wheel with

may standardize production with
consequent gain to both parties."
"Not many years ago the buyer
took what the seller had to sell; to
day the seller makes what the buyer
wants to buy," Mr. Crossley averred.
Because of this new development

to determine the opinion of the con
sumer, hence the increasing impor

speaker said.
"The question of proper selection
of consumer groups has largely been
eliminated through experimentation
and experience," Mr. Crossley said.
"Today the problem is to make the
questions thoroughly understood as
well as to eliminate those who an
swer as they think you desire.
People are too easy to please," he
added.
PROPAGANDA DISCUSSED
Dr. Harwood L. Childs, Prince
ton professor of politics, stated in
his address to the group that Ger
man propaganda via radio broad
casts is more effective than that of
the British due to its appeal to the
masses.
"British technique is more re
strained and subtle than the Ger
man broadcasts which are much
more specific, vivid, and pointed than
