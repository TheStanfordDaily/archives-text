# Consumer Polls Gaining Favor, Says Crossley
## Market Expert Tells Short Course About Opinion Sampling 
### 
"Americans are incredibly gullible
â€”for a time," Archibald M. Crossley,
president of Crossley, Incorporated,
nationally known research organiza
tion, told members of the short
course in Public Relations yester
day.
"I know, because I live in Prince
ton, where Wells' 'Martian Invasion'
supposedly took place," he said.
Americans have never hesitated to
express their opinions, and as a re
sult methods of sampling consumer
opinion are becoming of increasing
importance, Mr. Crossley asserted.
CONSUMER OPINION VITAL
"A number of the largest manu
facturers scarcely turn a wheel with
regard to marketing without sam
pling consumer opinion," he said.
Asserting that consumers are be
ing subjected to an increasing
amount of production standardiza
tion, the consumer opinion authority
said:
"Much of the aim of recent na
tional advertising has been to stand
ardize the lines of choice in con
sumers' purchases so the producer
may standardize production with
consequent gain to both parties."
"Not many years ago the buyer
took what the seller had to sell; to
day the seller makes what the buyer
wants to buy," Mr. Crossley averred.
Because of this new development
it is to the interest of the producer
to determine the opinion of the con
sumer, hence the increasing impor
tance of marketing research, the
speaker said.
"The question of proper selection
of consumer groups has largely been
eliminated through experimentation
and experience," Mr. Crossley said.
"Today the problem is to make the
questions thoroughly understood as
well as to eliminate those who an
swer as they think you desire.
People are too easy to please," he
added.
PROPAGANDA DISCUSSED
Dr. Harwood L. Childs, Prince
ton professor of politics, stated in
his address to the group that Ger
man propaganda via radio broad
casts is more effective than that of
the British due to its appeal to the
masses.
"British technique is more re
strained and subtle than the Ger
man broadcasts which are much
more specific, vivid, and pointed than
the generalities of the English," Dr.
Childs said.
"The Nazis were much better pre
pared for propaganda warfare than
the British, who were particularly
slow in utilizing short wave broad
casting and adapting it to the needs
of today," he asserted.
In their broadcasts to the United
States, both belligerents are utiliz
ing the services of native-born
Americans as broadcasters, but the
Germans employ a large number and
have recently increased their efforts
to propagandize North America.
"Surprisingly enough, there is
little actual distortion of news," Dr.
Childs said. "Lack of care in se
lecting news, incompleteness, and
failure to report developments are
the belligerents' greatest sins."
Concerning strategy, the lecturer
asserted that English technique is to
emphasize the moral issue and Eng
land's strength, whereas Germany
claims in her broadcasts that Eng
land is an anachronism and the pres
ent war is one of the international
finance. Thus she hopes to turn the
common people away from the gov
ernment to open revolt.
LABOR PRESSES CONDEMNED
Dr. Don D. Lescohier, professor of
economics at the University of Wis
consin, said far-reaching changes in
labor press conceptions are a neces
sary requisite to industrial peace.
"Hostile papers keep participants
inflamed and prevent the calm dis
cussion which is necessary for emo
tional unity. It's not to the interest
of either capital or labor to keep the
other inflamed by means of a paper
which caters to the emotions of its
readers," the economist asserted.
Russell L. Greenman, consultant
on management-government rela
tions, stressed the necessity of study
ing the minority reports of the su
preme court for reflections of trends
of thought which might lead to legis
lation.
"Uncertainty of present - day Su
preme Court decisions makes busi
ness procedure concerning price
fixing most uncertain. One must
guess who is to be the next assist
ant attorney-general if one wants
an indication of what future action
concerning anti-trust laws will be,"
Mr. Greenman said.
FLANLEY TELLS OF CONSUMER
Mabel G. Flanley, consumer-re
search authority, pointed to the im
portance of counter relations with
the customer in her discussion of
consumer relations in retail stores.
Pointing to the need for retailer
initiative in fostering improved con
sumer relations, Miss Flanley said:
"Management itself must furnish
the ignition spark on setting con
sumer relations in motion; it is here
that the all-important personal con
tact is best utilized."
PERSONAL CONTACTS LAUDED
Rex F. Harlow, president of the
American Council on Public Rela
tions, also emphasized the need for
personal contact in business enter
prises.
"The man on the job who is ac
quainted with immediacy of contact
with his work can often do a better
public relations job than the public
relations expert," Dr. Harlow
averred.
Rubber insulation to absorb the
effects of vibration found a new use
recently when the owner of a large
sailing yacht used it to insulate his
dining table from the vibration
caused by a Diesel engine used for
lighting.
