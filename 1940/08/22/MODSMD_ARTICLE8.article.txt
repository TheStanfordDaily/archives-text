# Childs Predicts World Union
## Labor, Consumer, Legislation Discussed 
### 
Dr. Harwood L. Childs, associate
professor of politics at Princeton and
expert on public opinion, told the
Public Relations short course Tues
day that some form of international
government was ultimate.
"The union of nations will come
about either through one powerful
dictator or through international
agreements, but it is obvious that
the present system is inadequate," he
said.
The speaker declared that liberal
nations must organize to combat
"isms" and democracies must match
the efficient organization of the dic
tatorships.
"In Germany the ministry of prop
aganda is only one department of the
propaganda organization," said Dr.
Childs. "Naziism is an integral part
of every government institution, and
propaganda has the full power of the
state behind it."
Dr. Childs said that due to gov
ernment control of radio, press, the
ater, films, art, literature, and music,
there was a certain uniformity about
all German radio programs, posters,
newspaper stories, and motion pic
tures.
LEADERSHIP IN LABOR
Dr. Don D. Lescohier, professor of
economics at the University of Wis
consin and authority on labor rela
tions, spoke on leadership in labor.
"Employers are like parents," he
said. "And they usually don't know
what their children need as well as
the children themselves."
He cited the story of a large con
cern which was having labor trouble
and decided to formulate a definite
labor policy. The foremen of the
company looked over the new policy
and after two years' discussion they
returned it almost completely
changed. The board of directors
feared that the workingmen and their
unions would make even more dras
tic changes. But they returned the
policy with no comments. The fore
men, being close to the men, had
known exactly what they required
in a labor policy.
"The president of the company
must be a leader, not a boss," said
Dr. Lescohier. "He should get to
gether with his employees and talk
things over in a friendly manner.
It is better to have grievances
stated aloud immediately than to
have them continue to hang in the
offing."
SOCIAL SECURITY
Mr. Russell L. Greenman, expert
on social security legislation, told the
conference that the present social
security act was an effort to help the
"one-third of the nation which is
ill-fed, ill-housed, and ill-clad."
"Insurance companies are the chief

opponents of social security," said
Greenman. "They are afraid that it
will decrease their sales of an
nuities."
"Direct Legislation" was the topic
of Dr. Edwin A. Cottrell, executive
head of the Department of Political
Science at Stanford. He said that
California was particularly progres
sive in the use of the initiative and
referendum, and at least 65 per cent
of the voters voted at these elections.
"We didn't use to have horse
races, wrestling, dog races, or pari
mutuel betting in California," said
Dr. Cottrell. "Do you know how we
got them? By an initiative ballot
and promising to give half the profits
to educational institutions and war
veterans."

Childs. "Naziism is an integral part
of every government institution, and
propaganda has the full power of the
state behind it."
Dr. Childs said that due to gov
ernment control of radio, press, the
ater, films, art, literature, and music,
there was a certain uniformity about
all German radio programs, posters,
newspaper stories, and motion pic
tures.
LEADERSHIP IN LABOR
Dr. Don D. Lescohier, professor of
economics at the University of Wis
consin and authority on labor rela
tions, spoke on leadership in labor.
"Employers are like parents," he
said. "And they usually don't know
what their children need as well as
the children themselves."
He cited the story of a large con
cern which was having labor trouble
and decided to formulate a definite
labor policy. The foremen of the
company looked over the new policy
and after two years' discussion they
returned it almost completely
changed. The board of directors
feared that the workingmen and their
unions would make even more dras
tic changes. But they returned the
policy with no comments. The fore
men, being close to the men, had
known exactly what they required
in a labor policy.
"The president of the company
must be a leader, not a boss," said
Dr. Lescohier. "He should get to
gether with his employees and talk
things over in a friendly manner.
It is better to have grievances
stated aloud immediately than to
have them continue to hang in the
offing."
SOCIAL SECURITY
Mr. Russell L. Greenman, expert
on social security legislation, told the
conference that the present social
security act was an effort to help the
"one-third of the nation which is
ill-fed, ill-housed, and ill-clad."
"Insurance companies are the chief

opponents of social security," said
Greenman. "They are afraid that it
will decrease their sales of an
nuities."
"Direct Legislation" was the topic
of Dr. Edwin A. Cottrell, executive
head of the Department of Political
Science at Stanford. He said that
California was particularly progres
sive in the use of the initiative and
referendum, and at least 65 per cent
of the voters voted at these elections.
"We didn't use to have horse
races, wrestling, dog races, or pari
mutuel betting in California," said
Dr. Cottrell. "Do you know how we
got them? By an initiative ballot
and promising to give half the profits
to educational institutions and war
veterans."
Dr. Harwood L. Childs, associate
professor of politics at Princeton and
expert on public opinion, told the
Public Relations short course Tues
day that some form of international
government was ultimate.
"The union of nations will come
about either through one powerful
dictator or through international
agreements, but it is obvious that
the present system is inadequate," he
said.
The speaker declared that liberal
nations must organize to combat
"isms" and democracies must match
the efficient organization of the dic
tatorships.
"In Germany the ministry of prop
aganda is only one department of the
propaganda organization," said Dr.
Childs. "Naziism is an integral part
of every government institution, and
propaganda has the full power of the
state behind it."
