# Best of Summer Dramas To Be Repeated This Fall
## 
### 
"She Stoops to Conquer" and "Mr/
Congressman," major plums in this
summer's dramatic pudding, will be
served again to a Stanford audience

retained for both productions, the
first of which—Oliver Goldsmith's
comedy—will take to the boards on
October 4 and 5. It will be followed
on the 25 and 26 by "Mr. Congress
man."
Both plays were presented by Di

verse drama, and dramatic sketch of
the year. This year, the Etherage
Award for comedy judged by Lynn
Fontanne, went jointly to Muriel Roy
Bolton for her rib-tickling "Formula
for Pancakes" and to Ronald Elwy
Mitchell's "No Boots in Bed."
Richard Nusbaum won the Max
well Anderson verse drama award
with his lyrical "A Parting at Ims
dorf" which the Alliance presented
in formal group reading. The McGaw
award went to Pauline Shortridge
for her sketch "A Thing Called
Power." The Gray award for dra-

'matic cricticism went to Wanda
Whitman.
PRIZES NEXT YEAR
"Formula for Pancakes" was pre
sented Saturday night to a full house
in the Little Theater. Under the di
rection of Ralph Schram, members
of the Peninsula Summer Workshop
rollicked with extreme ease and
smoothness through an unsentimen
tal picture of college dormitory life.
With the exception of the McGaw
award for a short dramatic sketch,
all the prizes will be offered again
next year. In place of the McGaw
award will be a $50 prize for a one
act play, preferably arranged for
radio. Closing date for the competi
tion will be April 15, 1941.
ROADRUNNERS RUN RIOT
Under the sponsorship of the Alli
ance, S. Stephenson Smith delivered
three lectures on comedy, and the
Red Gate Players presented an
English version of ancient Chinese
shadow puppet plays.
On July 10 and 11, the Division
of Speech and Drama was host to a
conference on Children and the The
ater, under the direction of Hazel
Robertson, director of the Palo Alto
Children's Theater.
While the rest of the farm struggle
valiantly with studies, ten Stanford
students organized a road company
to tour western America. Calling
themselves "Roadrunner Produc
tions," the company moves around
by trailer. After opening in Palo
Alto on July 12, the roadrunners
headed east via Lake Tahoe.
