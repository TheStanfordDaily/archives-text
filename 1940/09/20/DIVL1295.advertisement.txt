You'll live in Vassarcttes at College (practically
everybody does) because they're made to indent
and taper so artfully there's not a hint of artifice
about the finished product. You feel wonderful
in a Vassarette, too. Smooth and trim, easy and
free all at the same time. That's because assar
are full-fashioned (of lastex, rayon and lisle)
* * fit perfectly all ways at all times. Why not stop
ii wur Corset Salon today for a Vasaarette figure!
