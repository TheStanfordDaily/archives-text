# Stanford Upset In College Golf
## 
### 
Winners of the national collegiate
golf championship for two years in a
row, the Stanford golf team was up
set at the college meet at Vermont
in June to come in fourth.
Although Warren Berl, Don Ken
nedy, Hal Stone, and Don Haslett
qualified for the championship
flight, Haslett was the only one to
last through the first round. Berl,
who was not defeated until the finals
last year, had been one of the favor
ites of the tourney. Other members
of the team were Sherm Selix and
George Bradley.
Berl came through at Minneapolis
in July to reach the semi-finals of
the Western Amateur Tournament.
Early in September he competed in
the state amateur meet at Del Monte
until he was defeated by Jack Gage
in the quarter-finals.
Bud Finger of Stanford won the
Stanford Invitational Tournament in
July from John Kohler, a Farm
graduate, one up. Among the many
prominent Stanford sportsmen com
peting were Dink Templeton, Bones
Hamilton, and Alf Branden.
Several of Coach Eddie Twiggs'
outstanding divotmen will return to
the Farm next year, including War
ren Berl, Bud Finger, Sherm Selix,
Don Haslett, and George Bradley.
