# Indian Gridders Drill For Upward Climb
## Standlee, Albert Return to Lead Indian Varsity in U.S.F. Battle Sixty Players Give Photographers Preview of Squad in First Practice Of Season; 24 Lettermen Report 
### 
With over sixty candidates for the 1940 Indian varsity on hand, Head
Football Coach Clark Shaughnessy began drilling his team for the coming
gridiron battles with two workouts on Thursday, September 12.
The morning session was turned over to newspaper and newsi'eel pho
tographers, but in the afternoon the squad went to work in earnest to pre-

â–ºpare for the opening tilt of the sea
son September 28 against George
Malley's University of San Francisco
Dons in Kezar Stadium.
Present plans are to continue the
two-a-day practice procedure until
registration starts September 23. It
is probable that most of the work
outs will be open only to the press,
following a policy of secret practice
that was inaugurated last spring.
MANY ENDS OUT
Stan Graff finds himself in this
difficulty at left end. A two-year
letterman, Graff may get the call in
the U.S.F. game because of his ex
perience, but sophomore Hank Nor
berg and junior college transfer
Clem Tomerlin will be pressing him.
Graff was third on the '39 squad in
playing time with 428 minutes, is ag
gressive and very dependable.
Hank Norberg, whom injuries kept
from playing much frosh ball last
year, looks like a potentially great
flankman. Big and fast, Norberg
handled passes nicely and was a ter
ror on defense in spring practice.
Tomerlin, a transfer from Pasadena
J.C., is of slight build, but a very
clever, tricky end.
A wide open fight seems in the
offing for the left tackle position va
cated by Captain Stan Andersen.
Leading the list in spring practice
was Winkie Jones, 6-foot, 210-pound
junior from Okmulgee, Oklahoma.
TAYLOR PROMISING
One of the most promising line
men in spring, practice was Chuck
Taylor, first string quarterback on
the '39 Papoose eleven. Shifted to
tackle, the aggressive redhead im
proved rapidly.
Swede Johansen, varsity substitute
last year, is big and powerful, very
tough on defense, but not particu
larly fast.
John German, heavier than he was
last year, has been held back by in
juries the last two years and never
had a chance to show his real ability.
A powerful, aggressive guard, Her
man is good on both offense and de
fense.
Warren McCain, another sopho
more, showed a lot of promise last
spring.
ROBESKY IMPROVED
Ken Robesky came into his own in
the closing games last season, taking
over the regular job when injuries
depleted the guard ranks and turn
ing in several good games.
A peculiar situation developed at
the center position last spring. Jim
Verdieck, the regular last year, and
one of the most consistently good
linemen on the squad all season, was
on the baseball team and turned out
for practice late. Three other pivot
men were going so well that Ver
dieck found himself on the fourth
string, and the way things look now
he'll have a whale of a battle to get
his starting job back.
Doug Stahle developed rapidly to
ward the end of the '39 campaign.
FINDSKOG RATED HIGH
Also in the thick of the fight for
the starting center job are Vic
Lindskog, a transfer from Santa Ana
J.C., Colin McClintock, big junior
letterman, and Jake Thompson, a
small but scrappy and intelligent
player.
Chick Orme, another promising
ball player who has been handi
capped by injuries for the past two
campaigns, heads the right guard
candidates. Dick Palmer, a star
guard for the o9 frosh was not in the
University last spring, but came back
this summer, and if on hand, may
step right into the position.
Jack Warnecke, substitute last
year behind Corky Donahue, came
along very fast last season and fig
ures to be greatly improved this fall.
He'll get a lot of competition from
Bruno Banducei, star sophomore
lineman from Richmond. Other right
tackles are Dean Burford and Bill
Mannon.
ALBERT TO SPARKLE
Freddie Meyer looks like the
money at light end. A junior, over
six feet tall and weighing around
190, Meyer is fast and aggressive, an
excellent pass-snatcher. Ed Stamm,
a 215-pound giant from the frosh
will give him a fight for the job.

The situation in the backfield
seems well under control. Frankie
Albert held down quarterback on the
"A" squad last spring. A great left
handed passer, a fine left footed
kicker, and an elusive running back,
Albert should fit into the new posi
tion well.
KMETOVIC GETS CALL
Behind Albert at quarterback are
A 1 Cole, stocky 155-pound sopho
more who looked very good in spring
practice, Ray Hammett, an unknown
on the '39 Papoose squad, was dis
covered as a fine all-around prospect
in the spring sessions, and Jim Mc-
Cloud.
Pete Kmetovic, the San Jose
speedster, gets the pre-season call at
left half. A fine all-around back,
though a little light, "Kmet" should
benefit by experience received in 178
minutes of playing time last year.
Jack Francis, quarterback on the
frosh two years ago, is back in school
and was shifted to half last spring.
A rugged, hard-hitting blocking back
and a steady defensive player, Fran
cis should prove valuable with ex
perience.

I Bob "Crunch" Crane, a chunky
193-pounder, is another back who
hits with a lot of power.
At right half Hugh Gallarneau, an
other left-hander, tops the list. An
extremely fast breakaway runner,
Gallarneau played beautilu! ball in
spring practice.
John Casey, a 190-pound speed
ster who saved a year of eligibility
last fall, is a very dangerous ball
carrier, may be shifted to left half.
Thor Peterson, another gridder who
has been plagued by injuries during
his last two years, is a fast, hard hit
ting back who can develop into a
very fine ball player.
STANDLEE TO STAR
One man on the squad who, bar
ring injuries, is sure to be in the
starting lineup against the Dons is
Norm Standlee. A touchdown threat
every time he carries the ball, hit
ting with great power straight
ahead and almost impossible to stop
in the open, Standlee, if Stanford
football fortunes are good, will give
John Kimbrough a terrific battle for
All-American. Standlee was on the
bench only 46 minutes out of nine

games last fall.
Relieving Standlee will be sopho
more Milt Vucinich, one of the most
promising backs to appear at Stan
ford in some time. A powerful run
ner and a good kicker and passer,
Vucinich should develop into a star.
