# New Coaches Swamp Farm
## 
### 
When classes start at Stanford on
September 25, 1940, there will be at
least five new coaches, three of them
new in the sense that they did not
have charge of their respective teams
last season although they have been
here since the beginning of spring
quarter, 1940.
Most publicized of the new coaches
is, of course, Clark Daniel Shaugh
nessy, head football coach, who came
to Stanford last spring from Chicago
University to take charge of spring
football practice.
Another head coach comes to the
Farm in the person of Franklin
"Pitch" Johnson, who takes over
Stanford's varsity track team with
the able assistance of Bill Ellington,
who did such a fine job as head track
coach last spring after Dink Temple
ton took his leave of absence.
When Shaughnessy arrived last
spring he brought with him three
assistant coaches, John Philip
Bengtson, line coach, Marchmont
Howard Schwartz, backfield coach,
and Bernie Masterson, quarterback
coach. Of that group Bengtson, and
Schwartz started fall practice Thurs
day, September 12, Masterson having
gone back to play for the Chicago
Bears, professional football team.
Besides Schwartz and Bengtson,
Shaughnessy will have as assistants
Jim Lawson, end coach, Ernest
"Husky" Hunt, grey coach, and
Harry Shipkey, freshman coach.
NEW POLO COACH
The fifth new coach is Major F. A.
Garrecht, who will handle Stan
ford's horse polo teams this year.
Major Garrecht, who hails from Fort
Meyers, Virginia, will replace Major
Smith, last year's polo mentor.
Anyone who witnessed the East-
West football game in San Francisco
in 1935 probably saw Phil Bengtson
in action, for after winning three
football letters at the University of
Minnesota as a tackle, being named
all-conference and ail-American,
Bengtson was invited to play in the
Shriners New Year's classic.
Following his graduation from
Minnesota Bengtson became line
coach at the University of Missouri,
a position which he held until after
the 1939 football season.

Shaughnessy's other new coaching
aide, Marchie Schwartz, was a two

into coaching, taking a position as
backfield coach at Notre Dame in
1932 and 1933, and at Chicago Uni
versity in 1934. From 1935 to 1939
Schwartz was athletic director and
head football coach at Creighton

Shaughnessy's other new coaching
aide, Marchie Schwartz, was a two
time All-American halfback from
Notre Dame where he won three
football letters from 1929 to 1931, in
clusive. Schwartz, too, went directly
into coaching, taking a position as
backfield coach at Notre Dame in
1932 and 1933, and at Chicago Uni
versity in 1934. From 1935 to 1939
Schwartz was athletic director and
head football coach at Creighton
University.
When classes start at Stanford on
September 25, 1940, there will be at
least five new coaches, three of them
new in the sense that they did not
have charge of their respective teams
last season although they have been
here since the beginning of spring
quarter, 1940.
Most publicized of the new coaches
is, of course, Clark Daniel Shaugh
nessy, head football coach, who came
to Stanford last spring from Chicago
University to take charge of spring
football practice.
Another head coach comes to the
Farm in the person of Franklin
"Pitch" Johnson, who takes over
Stanford's varsity track team with
the able assistance of Bill Ellington,
who did such a fine job as head track
coach last spring after Dink Temple
ton took his leave of absence.
When Shaughnessy arrived last
spring he brought with him three
assistant coaches, John Philip
Bengtson, line coach, Marchmont
Howard Schwartz, backfield coach,
and Bernie Masterson, quarterback
coach. Of that group Bengtson, and
Schwartz started fall practice Thurs
day, September 12, Masterson having
gone back to play for the Chicago
Bears, professional football team.
Besides Schwartz and Bengtson,
Shaughnessy will have as assistants
Jim Lawson, end coach, Ernest
"Husky" Hunt, grey coach, and
Harry Shipkey, freshman coach.
NEW POLO COACH
The fifth new coach is Major F. A.
Garrecht, who will handle Stan
ford's horse polo teams this year.
Major Garrecht, who hails from Fort
Meyers, Virginia, will replace Major
Smith, last year's polo mentor.
Anyone who witnessed the East-
West football game in San Francisco
in 1935 probably saw Phil Bengtson
in action, for after winning three
football letters at the University of
Minnesota as a tackle, being named
all-conference and ail-American,
Bengtson was invited to play in the
Shriners New Year's classic.
Following his graduation from
Minnesota Bengtson became line
coach at the University of Missouri,
a position which he held until after
the 1939 football season.
