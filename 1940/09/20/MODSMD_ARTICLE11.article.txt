### 
Your first contact with Stanford's
traditions will be a negative one:
you won't be hazed by supercilious
sophomores; you won't be given rules
to learn and obey, or hats to wear
which will mark you as a "lowly
frosh,"
You will be treated as a "Stanford
man" or a "Stanford woman," and
the traditions you observe will be
those followed by the rest of the
school. None of them are enforced
by self-righteous upper-classmen,
but are tangible parts of the whole
"Stanford Spirit." If they seem
vague at first, it is because you too
have picked up this intangible some
thing oalled spirit that makes Stan
ford individual.
