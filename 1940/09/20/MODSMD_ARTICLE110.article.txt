# Boston Bees Shift Training Quarters
## 
### 
The Boston Bees of the National
League will train next spring at San
Antonio, Texas, instead of in Florida
where they have practiced for the
past two seasons.
Secretary John Quinn of the Bees
said the club and the St. Louis
Browns, who will also be in San
Antonio, would play several exhibi
tion games there and will travel east
together after breaking camp.
