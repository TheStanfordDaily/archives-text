# Frosh Footballers Show Promise
## First Practice Session Raises Hopes for Team To Equal Past Records 
### 
I'nder the watchful eye of Coach Harry Shipkey and his assistants Rob
<ll Hones" Hamilton. Boh Dakan, and Jens Hugge, Stanford's freshman
112. othallers went through their first sweating practice session Thursday,
S< pft-tnher 12.
Although the real quality of his charges is as yet unknown, Shipkey

has high hopes for another
I ill season. Last year the Papooses
f.'iine through with a very respect
able record, with victories over
IJ.C LA. frosh, Cal frosh, and sev
i i;il junior colleges. The only dark
spot on an otherwise bright record
was a 13-12 defeat at the hands of
Ihi* U.S.C. Trobabes.
After three weeks of practice the
fro: I) gridders will take on San Ma
li o Junior College in Stanford Sta
ciiimi, which should prove little more
Hi;.n a warm-up game.
I ( LA. NEXT
The following week-end the frosh
travel to Los Angeles to play the
U.C.LA, freshmen in what Shipkey
hopes will be a repeat of last year's
{ .it ie, which Stanford won, 40-0.
On successive week-ends in their
home stadium the frosh gridders
meet Modesto Junior College, Uni
versity of Southern California
freshmen, and Chaffey Junior Col
lege. And for the final game of their
.season on November 9 the Papooses
1 ravel to Berkeley to battle the Cal
frosh in the Little Big Game. Last
year's score was Stanford 13, Cali
fornia 6. The Papoose squad also de
feated their northern rival in the
:i!)38 tilt.
A TOUGH TASK
"It will be a difficult task to equal
the records of the past two freshman
.■ quads, who have lost only one game
in the two years," Shipkey admitted,
"but our entering roster of players
looks more 'han promising. I'd sort
of like to find another Frankie Al
bert or A 1 Cole."
The squad of course plans to con
rentrate on fundamentals, with an
eye cocked to varsity play next year.
"Bones" Hamilton will direct exten
,' ive practice in blocking, so badly
needed by Stanford squads.
"Of course, the change in coaching
systems is going to necessitate sev
eral changes in the fundamentals I
teach "my squad, but the boys seem
intelligent enough to absorb the
plays," Shipkey added.

eye cocked to varsity play next year.
"Bones" Hamilton will direct exten
,' ive practice in blocking, so badly
needed by Stanford squads.
"Of course, the change in coaching
systems is going to necessitate sev
eral changes in the fundamentals I
teach "my squad, but the boys seem
intelligent enough to absorb the
plays," Shipkey added.
lIKKL THEY ARE
Of the many freshmen signed up
for football, the following, judging
merely by their high school play,
look to be the more promising.
Bill Josslyn, 195-pound center,
who was San Francisco All-City, and
one of the most highly rated linemen
in the Bay area; Rob Koch, 182-
pound, All-City fullback from Port
land; and Jean LaMoure, cracker
jaek 200-pound tackle from Fresno.
Two brothers, Bill and Kelly Ross,
two All-State men weighing 216 and
l!>8, respectively, have come from I
A rkansas.

I'nder the watchful eye of Coach Harry Shipkey and his assistants Rob
<ll Hones" Hamilton. Boh Dakan, and Jens Hugge, Stanford's freshman
112. othallers went through their first sweating practice session Thursday,
S< pft-tnher 12.
Although the real quality of his charges is as yet unknown, Shipkey

has high hopes for another
I ill season. Last year the Papooses
f.'iine through with a very respect
able record, with victories over
IJ.C LA. frosh, Cal frosh, and sev
i i;il junior colleges. The only dark
spot on an otherwise bright record
was a 13-12 defeat at the hands of
Ihi* U.S.C. Trobabes.
After three weeks of practice the
fro: I) gridders will take on San Ma
li o Junior College in Stanford Sta
ciiimi, which should prove little more
Hi;.n a warm-up game.
I ( LA. NEXT
The following week-end the frosh
travel to Los Angeles to play the
U.C.LA, freshmen in what Shipkey
hopes will be a repeat of last year's
{ .it ie, which Stanford won, 40-0.
On successive week-ends in their
home stadium the frosh gridders
meet Modesto Junior College, Uni
versity of Southern California
freshmen, and Chaffey Junior Col
lege. And for the final game of their
.season on November 9 the Papooses
1 ravel to Berkeley to battle the Cal
frosh in the Little Big Game. Last
year's score was Stanford 13, Cali
fornia 6. The Papoose squad also de
feated their northern rival in the
:i!)38 tilt.
A TOUGH TASK
"It will be a difficult task to equal
the records of the past two freshman
.■ quads, who have lost only one game
in the two years," Shipkey admitted,
"but our entering roster of players
looks more 'han promising. I'd sort
of like to find another Frankie Al
bert or A 1 Cole."
