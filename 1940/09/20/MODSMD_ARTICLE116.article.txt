## 
### 
Edwin N. Atherton, whom the
Pacific Coast Conference hired to
clean up the conference football
situation in regard to subsidization
and proselyting, has gone to work
in earnest, latest reports showing
that he has ruled 12 boys ineli
gible to play football at the uni
versities of their choosing.
Most publicized of these boys is
Johnny Pelrovich of Alhambra High
School, who is said to be the greatest
grid prospect to come out of a south
ern California high school in
According to Atherton's ruling
rovich is ineligible to play football
for U.C.L.A. or U.S.C. PoV/ovich ac
cepted a summer job on/the U.C.L.A.
campus, then, a £ew weeks before
the start of sch.jo'j, he announced his
decision to enroll at U.S.C.
heapang denied
George Hobbs, Petrovich's high
school coach, has declared that he
will ask for a hearing on the part of
Petrovich and his high school team
mate, Theran Hodges. A statement
has been issued from Atherton's of
fice, to the effedt that since the rul
ing is against the universities in
volved and not the boys, the univer
sities are the only ones who can take
any action.
The University of California au
thorities, who were the first to in
stigate the move for a conference
clean-up, have admitted that they
are guilty of causing the ineligilibil
ity of one of the six boys whom
Atherton ruled out of competition at
that university. As far as the other
five boys are concerned, however, the
California authorities feel that the
actions causing their ineligibility
were grossly misinterpreted.
CAL DENIES CHARGES
The boys came to visit the U.C.
campus during their Easter vacation,
and during that period they were
entertained at Cal fraternity houses,
an action which California men feel
was free from any proselyting mo
tive since it was carried on inde
pendently of any connection with the
U.C. faculty.
Another point in Atherton's ruling
was that the boys in question were
issued equipment for a work-out on
a U.C. athletic field. Cal authorities
declare that this action, too, was
without any university faculty con
nection.

actions causing their ineligibility
were grossly misinterpreted.
