# Farm Stars Win College Net Tourney
## 
### BOB LOW 
California's athletic teams licked
Stanford in practically every sport
during the past year, but it was a
victory over California that gave
two Indian tennis players the in
tercollegiate doubles champion
ship at the Merion Cricket Club in
Philadelphia last June.
Larry Dee and Jimmy Wade trav
eled 3,000 miles to win the title from
Bob Peacock and Bob Harman in a
five-set final, 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 2-6, 6-2.
Not since Bill Seward and Ben
Dey won in 1936 has a Stanford
player captured either the singles or
doubles event. Stanford's last singles
winner was Keith Gledhill in 1931.
DEE, WADE UNSEEDED
Although unseeded in the tourney,
Dee and Wade showed in an early
round that they were slighted when
the draw was made. The Farm pair
upset the second seeded team of
Frank Guersey and Bob Curtis of
Rice Institute in the second round,
6-3, 2-6, 6-4, overcoming a 4-2 defi
cit in the deciding set.
After trouncing Frank Mehner and
Gordon Giles of the University of
Utah in the quarter-finals, Dee and
Wade came from behind to beat
George Toley and Ted Schroeder of
the University of Southern Califor
nia in the semis, 6-3, 7-9, 4-6, 6-3,
6-2. The Trojans were seeded third.
The final match saw the Stanford
couple play their most aggressive
tennis of the week. Harman and
Peacock had won the national clay
court championship the preceding
week in Chicago and the Bears were
highly favored when the match got
under way. Dee and Wade were off
to a two-set lead largely by ham
mering Harman's none-too-potent
service, but lapsed as Harman and
Peacock hit their stride in the third
and fourth chapters.
The Stanford team took advantage
! of an early break in service in the
fifth set and won handily as Peacock
and Harmon faltered.
BEATEN IN SINGLES
Stanford's three representatives,
Dee, Wade, and Bob Lov v ', faired
less well in the with none

utfes', and Frank Guernsey, twice
winner of the tournament, swept
through Low without difficulty.

achieved their greatest success in
the national collegiate tourney, they
had other successes during the long
summer circuit. Dee and Wade took
three straight doubles tournaments
before suffering a defeat. They won
the Western Pennsylvania title in
Pittsburgh without trouble the week
before the intercollegiates and con
tinued with a win of the Eastern In
tercollegiate championships at Mont
clair, N.J.. for the third win in as
many weeks.

the invitation tournament held at
North Conway, N.H., where he
reached the semi-finals only to lose
to Frank Kovacs, playing at his very
best. At Southampton, Dee teamed
| with Ed Alloo of Berkeley and
reached the finals of the doubles with

El wood Cooke, Wilmer Allison, and
John Van Ryn, and Charles Mattman
j and Harmon.
