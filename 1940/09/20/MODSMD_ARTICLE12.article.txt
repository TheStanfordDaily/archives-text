expanded and developed successful
features of previous pre-reg periods.

Haugh has taken one of the stand
out activities of former Pre-reg pro
grams—campus tours—and combined
them with the barbecue for what he
thinks will be one of the most en
joyable parts of the acclimation pe
riod. The tours, under Bob Snoddy,
will start at 2:30 o'clock Sunday

ten minutes from Encina to Ruble.
Then each bus, filled with an equal

each bus will deposit its occupants at
colorful and romantic Stanford Hill
