### JERRY MAYER 
Henceforth to be tabbed "Stanford, Class of '44,"
approximately 700 men and women will be on hand
Friday morning, Sept. 20, to take their first official
look at the Farm,
They will be welcomed and assisted by Jim Haugh,
chairman of the Prc-registration Committee, and 85

other veterans of college life at Stan-<
ford. A full three-day program has
been prepared by Haugh to enable
the incoming frosh men to meet the
neophyte women, and for both sexes
to become acquainted with Stanford
itself—its traditions, facilities, and
way of life.
VOTED SUCCESSFUL
Ninety-eight per cent of the men
and 98.5 per cent of the women who
attended last year's pre-reg program
voted it an overwhelming success,
and Haugh has added two features
to this year's schedule of activities
that he feels will considerably en
hance the 1940 orientation period.
Beside his innovations, Haugh has
expanded and developed successful
features of previous pre-reg periods.

at 8 o'clock for the new students.
