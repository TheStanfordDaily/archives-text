# Grid Regulation Changes Alter Pass Penalties, Timing Rules
## 
### 
Spectators in the football stadiums of the nation (his fall will have to
bear in mind several alterations in the rules made last winter by the Na
tional Football ltules Committee.
Four changes have been written into the rules, and two old regulations
are clarified for the benefit of ollieials. coaches, and players.

> Continuing the trend toward a
more open style of play and in
creased use of the forward pass as
an offensive weapon, the committee
changed the penalty for a forward
pass striking an ineligible player on
or behind the line of scrimmage to
the loss of a down. Formerly a 15-
yard penalty was attached, but now
the offense merely goes on an incom
plete pass.
PASSING PENALTY
If, however, the passer is trapped
behind the line and, trying to avoid
being thrown for a loss, passes
the ball and it contacts an ineligible
player behind or on the line of scrim
mage, a penalty of 15 yards and the
loss of a down ensues. The penalty
for the ball touching an ineligible
receiver beyond the scrimmage line
remains the same, 15 yards and the <
loss of a down.
The penalty for roughing the |
passer will be enforced this fall from
the point of the previous down in
stead of from the spot of the foul.
TIME LOWERED
Probably the most significant rule |
change is that which lowers the time |
for putting the ball in play from 30 j
seconds to 25. Some authorities be- !
lieve that this change will cause j
many teams to abandon the huddle
system in favor of the old signal sys
tem. It is also expected that this
revision will, by speeding up the j
game, give the paying customer more '
football for his money.
The fourth rule revision deals with
equipment, shortening conical cleats
on the shoes and stating that the
point head must be parallel with the
base.
FREE BALL RULE
One regulation that was clarified
puts the officials on their guard to
determine if a free ball is intention
ally kicked, and if it is to enforce
the penalty.
Another clarification practically
strips the quick-kicker from protec
tion, making the "running into the
kicker" penalty applicable only if it '
is "reasonably obvious" that he is '
going to kick.

behind the line and, trying to avoid
being thrown for a loss, passes
the ball and it contacts an ineligible
player behind or on the line of scrim
mage, a penalty of 15 yards and the
loss of a down ensues. The penalty
for the ball touching an ineligible
receiver beyond the scrimmage line
remains the same, 15 yards and the <
loss of a down.
The penalty for roughing the |
passer will be enforced this fall from
the point of the previous down in
stead of from the spot of the foul.
TIME LOWERED

change is that which lowers the time |
for putting the ball in play from 30 j
seconds to 25. Some authorities be- !
lieve that this change will cause j
many teams to abandon the huddle
system in favor of the old signal sys
tem. It is also expected that this

kicker" penalty applicable only if it '
is "reasonably obvious" that he is '
going to kick.
Spectators in the football stadiums of the nation (his fall will have to
bear in mind several alterations in the rules made last winter by the Na
tional Football ltules Committee.
Four changes have been written into the rules, and two old regulations
are clarified for the benefit of ollieials. coaches, and players.

> Continuing the trend toward a
more open style of play and in
creased use of the forward pass as
an offensive weapon, the committee
changed the penalty for a forward
pass striking an ineligible player on

the loss of a down. Formerly a 15-
yard penalty was attached, but now
the offense merely goes on an incom
plete pass.
