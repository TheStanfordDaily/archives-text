# Huskies Favored in Wide-Open 1940 Coast Grid Conference
## Speed, Not Power, Dominates Scene As Experts Ponder Year's Chances 
### 
Jimmy Phelan and his Washington
Huskies, so a good many gridiron
experts say, will occupy the West's
bench in the Rose Bowl on January
1, 1941. Other forecasters, recalling
the Seattle team's nose-dive when
cast in a similar role before the '37
season began, satisfy themselves with
grouping the Huskies with Southern
California and U.C.L.A. in a "first
division," leaving the five other ma
jor conference teams to fight it out
for the remaining rankings.
Regardless of who winds up on top,
one thing is a certainty, Pacific Coast
football fans will be treated to a
wide-open fight for championship
honors. No longer does any one
squad tower over the field as did
Howard Harding Jones' Mighty Men
of Troy for the last two years. Every
team in the conference except South
ern California and, possibly, U.C.-
L.A., figure to improve over their
showings last fall.
On the whole, the general trend
of Pacific Coast Conference football
seems destined to continue veering
toward faster and more open play,
with coaches concentrating more and
more on speed as contrasted to
power. Breakaway running backs
and quick-opening plays will be
more in evidence than ever before.
Following is a team-by-team fore
cast of the 1940 Coast Conference
picture.
WASHINGTON
Led by a pair of candidates for All-
American honors, Rudy Mucha and
Dean McAdams, Jimmy Phelan's
Huskies seem on the inside track to
the Rose Bowl.
In addition to the two M-men,
Washington will depend heavily on
Ernie Steele, a jackrabbit halfback,
Jack Staekpool, promising junior
fullback, and Don Means, a brainy
quarterback. McAdams rounds out
the backfield, is the best kicker on
the Coast and a rugged triple threat
back.
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
Reading a list of the Trojans who
have gone on, one is inclined to pity
Mr. Jones, but when such returning
stars as Bob Peoples, Mickey Ander
son, A 1 Krcuger, Ben Sohn, and Jack
Banta are on the scene, and with an
all-star freshman crop coming up,
it seems that the material for a very
potent football team is on hand.
U.S.C. may not go to the Rose
Bowl this year, but it should be a
safe bet that they'll finish one-two
three.
Over in West wood, Babe Horrell
faces the task of coaching his first

Washingtonless Bruin varsity, but
consolation for that great player's
departure is on hand in the person
of the other half of the "Gold Dust
Twins," Mr. Jack Robinson. With
Robinson present to give opposing
teams the galloping jitters, and an
able supporting cast, Horrell will
make another stab at reaching the
Rose Bowl.
Main obstacle in the Bruins' path
is a suicide schedule that includes
Santa Clara, Texas A. and M., the
defending Sugar Bowl champions
and nominated Number 1 team of
the nation, and Southern Methodist
in addition to seven P.C.C. oppon
ents.
OREGON STATE
Surprise of the Coast last fall, los
ing only to U.S.C., Lon Stiner's
Beavers, with nineteen lettermen re
turning, go into this season with a
good chance to finish at or near the
top.
Mainstay of a beefy, tough line
will be 200-pound Vic Sears. A fight
ing ball player, Sears makes it very
unpleasant for opponents trying to
get through the Beavers' left tackle.
Sparking the offense will be fullback
Jim Kisselburgh, a powerful runner
with an educated toe.
CALIFORNIA
The Golden Bears had rather a
bad time of it last fall, and should
improve their showing some this
year, especially if sophomore half
back Jim Judkovich lives up to his
press notices.
A light line and the absence of
Larry Youdall may keep the Berke
ley squad out of the first division.
OREGON
Tex Oliver's charges took some
thing of a bouncing around last year
after a strong start. Inexperience
seems the stumbling block this time,
although some promising material is
on hand. Given the breaks, the Web
feet may turn out to be a dangerous
dark horse.
WASHINGTON STATE
A strong team is in the making at
Babe Hollingberry's Pullman lair, but
it is doubtful whether it has enough
heavy artillery to compete with the
rest of the entries. The schedule
maker handed them a bad deal by
putting the Trojans on the top of the
Hollingbcrry must-see list. If the
Cougar can emerge from this fracas
in one piece he may be bad medi
cine for every other team on the
schedule.
