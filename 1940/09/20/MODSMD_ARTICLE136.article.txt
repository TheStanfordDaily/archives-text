## 
### 
With four lettcrmen returning for
water polo this season, Coach Nort
Thornton will lead what he claims
is an inexperienced team, but at the
same time a snappy outfit that
showed "excellent spirit In spring
practice."
The returning lettermen are Cap
tain Ted Moreno, guard, Dave Not
tage, centerback, and Duncan Patty
and Fred Man waring, forwards.
Eight men fighting for each position
and a total of 28 men out, judging
by spring practice figures, will make
it "tough even to make the squad,"
revealed Coach Thornton.
"The boys evidenced a good spirit
and worked hard in spring practice,"
he added.
