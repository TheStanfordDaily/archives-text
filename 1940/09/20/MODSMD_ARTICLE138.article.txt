# Veterans Strengthen Ball Team
## Thompson Coming Back; Coach Wolter Visions Pennant-Winning Squad 
### 
Although baseball season is quite a few months away, Coacli Harry
VVolter, nevertheless, will have his varsity diamondmen out for practice
before fall quarter is long under way. As a matter of fact. Stanford's wily
coach of America's favorite game expects to start practice as soon as he re
turns from Battle Creek, Michigan, where he will attend the American

Baseball Congress from Septem
ber 20 to 29.
Stanford's chances for the confer
ence baseball crown once more look
bright; however, things looked good
before last season and the Card*
ended-up in the conference cellar
This year, at any rate, Wolter will
have practically a veteran team tc
work with, Norm Juney, left fielder,
being the only regular who gradu
ated.
Other men who were regulars at
one time or another during the sea
son and have graduated are Sid
Lewis, catcher, Pat Nagano, right
fielder, and Dick Shortall, second
baseman. Bob Templeton, utility
outfielder, has also used up his eligi
bility.
COOTIE MOLDS UP
The mainstay of the team once
more looks to be big Quentin
"Cootie" Thompson, one of the con
ference's best pitchers although the
won and lost records do not show it.
Following the Card's spring baseball
season, Thompson was offered a con
tract by the Cincinnati Reds, who
look to be the 1940 pennant winners
of Lhe National League. Thompson,
however, turned down the contract
preferring to return to Stanford for
his senior year.
The remainder of the Card pitch
ing staff also remains intact, Claude
Purkitt, Bill Masters, and Russ Smith
all coming back for more competi
tion. In addition, Phil Wolf, star
I'rosh hurler, and his teammate, Bill
Harms, will lend their talents to the
array of moundsmen.
MANY CATCHERS
Veterans Herb Atkinson and Jack
Randall will be back to handle the
catching duties, along with Bill Han
lon and Oscar Holmes, last season's
frosh receivers.
The whole first-string infield from
last season will be back, with Hal
Costello on first, Harry Parsons at
second, Elton Boone at third, and
Monte Pfyl at shortstop. Last year's
frosh infield of Ray Hammett, first
base, Tommy Howard, second base,
Ted Falascia, third base, and Clark
Graham, shortstop, will be out to give
the veterans competition for their
uosts.
In the outfield the outlook is not
quite so bright, Alec Cerrighino, cen
ter fielder, being the only regular
first-stringer returning. However,
Clark Kellenberger was quite a sen
sation as a frosh the past season and
may move right into the left field
berth to make the fans forget steady
all-conference Norm Juney. Other
outfielders up from the frosh are Bill
Cunha and Al Cole.
STRONG OUTFIELD
Milt Vucinich, Frank Pfyl, Jim
Verdieek, and Jack Parsons, all of
whom played quite a bit of ball last
spring, will be back to bolster the
outfield situation. Aurelio Caruso, a
transfer from U.S.C. who was in
eligible last season, will also be fight
ing for a spot in the outfield.
