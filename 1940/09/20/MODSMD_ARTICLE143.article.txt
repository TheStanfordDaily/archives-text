# Bob Zuppke Wants No Lazy Gridders
## 
### 
Bob Zuppke doesn't like the type
of football player who turns out
"just to make the squad." Zuppke
will start his 28th season as Univer
sity of Illinois coach next Tuesday.
"It's no sin if you can't play foot
ball,-' he said, "but if you can't,
please don't come out. They come
out to the stadium so they can say
they're out for football and then
stand around and pray there won't
be any scrimmage."
