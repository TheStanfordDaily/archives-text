# Coach Johnson Refuses To Predict Track Future
## 'Pitch' Gets Settled, Likes Farm People 
### 
Franklin "Pitch" Johnson, who
takes over Bill Ellington's job as
head track coach this year, likes
j California weather and California
people fine, though he's still get
ting himself acclimated to his new
I position.
"I'm still getting settled here," he
remarked a.she looked at the calen
i dar. "Let's see, 1 arrived here on—
: August 19—gosh, have I been here
that long?"
Johnson is getting settled. He con-
I fided that he had "found a spot" near
! Los Altos.
i LIKES FARM MEN
"The kids like it. Oranges and
lemons right off the trees. They've
never seen anything like it."
He is most impressed, he confided,
by the fine people he has met here.
"It is a pleasure to work with such
men as Clark Shaughnessy, Harry
I Shipkey, Harry Maloney, Everett
Dean, and the rest. Everybody has
been so cordial."
STAFF SHORT-HANDED
His stall will include Bill Elling
ton and, after December 1, Clyde
Jeffrey, and that's all. Johnson de
plored the lack of another man, but
guessed they could handle it. About
the coming track season, he would
make no predictions.
"We've lost almost everybody but
Soldate in the distances and Grey in
the weights. And, of course, Jeffrey
was always good for ten points."
O.K.'s RELAYS
Coming from Drake, he showed
real interest in the Stanford-Califor
nia relays of last spring. "Of course,
California usually will have the ad
vantage, having more men in com
petition, but we won't plan to lose."
Johnson is a native of St. Louis,
Mo., and has an enviable record both
as competitor and coach. He ran the
high and low hurdles and broad
jumped as an Illinois undergraduate
from 1922-24, and captained the
squad in his senior year.
TIES WORLD MARK
In the 1924 Olympics at Boston he
tied the world record in the 110-
meter hurdles in 14.8 seconds, and
later reached the semi-finals in the
Paris Olympics. After graduation,
Johnson became assistant to Coach
Harry Gill at Illinois.
Leaving Illinois after the season of
1927, he became head coach at
Drake, where his teams won Mis
souri Valley titles in '31, '33, '35, and
'36. taking four firsts, two thirds, and
but one fourth.
Since 1933, Johnson has either been
president or secretary-treasurer of
NCTCA and has spent several terms
as a member of the track and field
committee of the Amateur Athletic
Union. He is now serving a four
year term on the rules committee of
the NCAA.
