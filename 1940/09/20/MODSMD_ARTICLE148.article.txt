# Hoopmen Open Against Hamlin
## 
### 
Basketball coaches of the Pacific
! Coast Conference, meeting in Los
Angeles Friday, September 7, adopt
j ed a schedule for 1940-41 season,
which is essentially the same as the
past schedules, with each team play
ing four games with each of the other
three Southern Division schools.
This action finally squashed the
plan to enlarge the league to take in
"independent" schools such as Santa
Clara, St. Mary's, and Loyola. Con
ference teams plan, however, to play
several double-headers against non
conference teams of this class, but
the games will not influence confer
ence standings.
Stanford's season will open with a
game against Hamlin University of
St. Paul. This school, coached by a
former pupil of Everett Dean's, has
won the Minnesota state champion
ship for eight years running.
On December 21 in San Francisco's
Civic Auditorium, the Indians will
meet Indiana University, the team
Everett Dean coached for 14 years
before coming to Stanford. Games
are also scheduled with Nebraska
and Santa Clara. The conference
season will open with the U.S.C.
Trojans here.
Returning lettermen are Fordy An
derson. Don Williams, Dick Taylor,
Ken Davidson, Bob Penn, Bob Wen
zel and Bill Cowden.
