# Swim Coach Hopes For P.C.C. Title
## 
### HAL SHAFER 
With an imposing array of Con
ference and P A. title-winners stuffed
up his sleeve, Nort Thornton, swim
ming coach, faces the coming season
"fairly confident' l of the conference
championship.
The team will be reinforced by
sophomores coming in from last
year's frosh swimming squad, which
Coach Thornton claims was the best
on the Coast.
Coach Thornton points out that
the splashers "should far surpass
anything on the Coast, provided that
several Fullerton J. C. aces do not
transfer to S.C."
CO-CAPTAINS RETURN
Strong men who will lead the
squad to the expected championship
are Roy Vitousek and Bill Weeden,
who were co-captains in their jun
ior year and who will lead the team
again this season.
Vitousek holds world's records in
the 50- and 100-yard breaststroke,
and is the Conference .breaststroke
champion. He is also the P.A.A.
champ in the 50- and 100-yard free
style and in the 100-yard breast
stroke.
Weeden, backstroke ace, took the
Conference crown in his sophomore
year and was runner-up for the title
last year.
STRONG IN RELAYS
From last season's varsity, Brad
Young and Bob Regnolds will take
over in the sprints, with A 1 Frost
and Duncan Patty swimming the
distances, the 220 and the 440. Coach
Thornton claims the team is strong
in both relay events.
Outstanding sophomores joining
the team from last year's excep
tional frosh outfit are Don Smith
and Bayard "Doc" Colyear, both
versatile in almost every event.
Freestylers stepping into varsity
trunks are Hays Busch, sprinter and
440 man, and Ralph Kiewit, 100 and
220 ace.
On the boards will be the capable
Howie Adams, Conference diving
champ in his sophomore year, and
Bill Niccols.
