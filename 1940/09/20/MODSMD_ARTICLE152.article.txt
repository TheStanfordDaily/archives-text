### JERRY BRUCKER 
Last winter representatives of the j
10 member schools of the Pacific
Coast Conference set up Edwin M. j
Atherton as a kind of athletic czar
to prevent athletic proselyting. The
schools took a firm stand against any I
off-color methods of securing the
services of high school and junior |
college stars. A complete code to
this end was put in force.
During the spring and summer j
coaches, alumni, students, and sports !
writers waited with what is often
known as "bated breath," speculat- j
ing as to just' how far the Atherton !
office would go in its persecution of
illegal practices. A few v/eeks ago
they found out.
Through one of his aides, Ather
ton declared that 14 high school
football players had been ruled in
eligible to compete for certain col- |
leges.
The printable way to describe
win.l follows, they tell me, is to
say that pandemonium broke
loose. The press blasted, dignified (
college officials made searing
statements, and the city of Ala
meda, whose favorite son. Johnny
Petrovich, had been ruled ineli- i
gible to phiv at both U.S.C. and i
U.C.L.A., threatened to secede from
the union. When the citizen? of i
that fair city cooled off :Â» little they
discovered that no one seemed to
tare much whether they seceded I
or not. As far as can be deter- I
mined, the plan was never carried
out, but their remains a good deal ;
of hard feeling against the czar.
The University ofCalifornia was i
hardest hit by the purge, which '
made six frosh prospects ineligible
for that school. This circumstance is
rather ironical, in that California was
one of the major boosters in the
move to clean up athletics.
After his three-school blitzkreig,
Mr. Atherton departed for the wilds
of (he Northwest, saying that more
of the same would probably be
forthcoming when conference schools
had completed registration about
September 28. We sincerely hope
that Stanford conies through un
scathed, but if the frosh squad which
started work under Harry Shipkey
September 12 suddenly becomes de
pleted come the end of the month,
we won't complain.
There's no doubt that proselyt
ing has no place in intercollegiate
sport. Some have tried to protect
it by pointing out that it gives
some men a chance to get an edu
cation who could not do so other
wise. Others say that it's unfair to
the boys who draw the crowds to
have all the money go to the uni
versity.
We'll admit that some very fine

men have traded athletic ability for
academic knowledge, but this does
not justify the practices that have
developed, cinch jobs, new cars,
scholarships to the girl friend, and
the like. The Frankenstein simile
fits. Edwin Atherton's salary is
$20,000 a year, but in view of the
sums colleges and alumni have been
spending for the glory of Alma
Mater, this amount is not too much.
As to the second objection, the
money derived by the university
from football is spread around over
the rest of the sports program, any
remaining goes to improve educa
tional facilities.
A good many people didn't like
the idea of punishing the hoys for
the fault of the alumni and others,
connected or not with the college,
who provide the inducements for a
good football player to attend
school A instead of school B.
Neither do I, and I'll venture to
say that Mr. Atherton feels the same,
but where else can the penalty be
placed so that it will be sufficiently
drastic to do good? You can't put
the men who contact the boys be
hind bars, and taking a fine out of
the school's gate receipts for the sea
son would not be effective or prac
tical. It's a case where the end must
justify the means.
Perhaps the above paragraphs
smack too much of idealism, but you
tell me a better place for idealism
than in collegiate athletics.
