# Cornell Indians, Texas Aggies Head Nation's Football Teams
## 
### CHESLEY SAROYAN 
Once again the weather gets crispy,
the leaves turn brown and football
season is here. Already the air is j
filled with footballs, the bars with j
ardent, arguing alumni and soon the
stadiums will be filled with wild- |
eyed rooters. So before the season
actually gets under way and before
the first upset occurs, let's try to an
alyze the national grid picture, sec
tion by section.
THE EAST
The Eastern picture at the present
time has a decided crimson tinge—
coming from the Red Machine of
Cornell. The Ithacans are three deep
J in every position and a top heavy
j favorite to walk off with the Ivy
League crown. Their big game is
, Ohio State, and if they get by the
I Buckeyes, they should remain un
j defeated.
Most nf Cornell's competition will
come from the Princeton Tigers. If
Davie Allerdice's magic arm remains
I ir.tact throughout the season, he may
! pitch the Tigers to prominence. Be-
I hind Princeton comes Fordham. Al
| though the Rams are weak in line
| material, with break-away backs
like Len Eshmont and Jim Blumen
stock, they will trouble the best of
:he Eastern teams.
Pennsylvania boasts of Francis
Reagan, who is one of the East's
finest backs. Outside Reagan, the
! Quakers have little to recommend
j them. Harvard and Yale will both
! be about as weak as last year.
But from the East come rumors
1 of a dark horse—Boston College.

Last year, the Eagles swept through
their regular season without a single
loss, but lost to Clemson on New
Years day. From this team only four
regulars will bo missing, so Boston
should have another undefeated year.
THE MID-WEST
The Mid-Western picture presents
a .naze of powerhouses. Topping
them is the powerful Michigan team.
Boasting of one of the best running
backs in the nation in the person of
All-American Tom Harmon, and one
of the deadliest of blockers, Forest
Evashevski, the Wolverines should
come close to the Big Ten crown.
But then there is Ohio State. The
Buckeyes have so many fine pros-
pects, they don't know which eleven
men to use. With backs like Don
Scott, Jim Strassbaugh and Captain
Jim Langhurst, Ohio State can't be
counted out of any Conference race.
Not in the Big Ten, but one of the
strongest teams in the Mid-West
should be the ever-potent Irish of
Notre Dame. Reserves are plentiful,
graduation losses were meager, so
the Irish look loaded.
Minnesota, though boasting of no
sensational stars, has a young team
and although they may not go too far
this year, a return to the glorious
days of Gopher history may not be
far away.
THE SOUTH
Down in the deep South, it looks
like Tennessee will be the cream of
the pig-skin crop. With linemen like
Bob Suffridge, Ed Molinski, and Abe
Shires and backs like Bobb Foxx and
Johnny Butler, the Volunteers will
be hard to stop.
Most of the trouble will come from
Tulane and Alabama. Also Duke
may develop into a powerhouse.
All the boys are young and green at
| Duke, but Coach Wade is pretty
j proud of his men, so don't count
I them out.

Boasting of one of the best running
backs in the nation in the person of
All-American Tom Harmon, and one
of the deadliest of blockers, Forest
Evashevski, the Wolverines should
come close to the Big Ten crown.
But then there is Ohio State. The
Buckeyes have so many fine pros-
pects, they don't know which eleven
men to use. With backs like Don
Scott, Jim Strassbaugh and Captain
Jim Langhurst, Ohio State can't be
counted out of any Conference race.
Not in the Big Ten, but one of the
strongest teams in the Mid-West
should be the ever-potent Irish of
Notre Dame. Reserves are plentiful,
graduation losses were meager, so
the Irish look loaded.
Minnesota, though boasting of no
sensational stars, has a young team
and although they may not go too far
this year, a return to the glorious
days of Gopher history may not be
far away.
THE SOUTH
Down in the deep South, it looks
like Tennessee will be the cream of
the pig-skin crop. With linemen like
Bob Suffridge, Ed Molinski, and Abe
Shires and backs like Bobb Foxx and
Johnny Butler, the Volunteers will
be hard to stop.
Most of the trouble will come from
Tulane and Alabama. Also Duke
may develop into a powerhouse.
All the boys are young and green at
| Duke, but Coach Wade is pretty
j proud of his men, so don't count
I them out.
Once again the weather gets crispy,
the leaves turn brown and football
season is here. Already the air is j
filled with footballs, the bars with j
ardent, arguing alumni and soon the
stadiums will be filled with wild- |
eyed rooters. So before the season
actually gets under way and before
the first upset occurs, let's try to an
alyze the national grid picture, sec
tion by section.
THE EAST
The Eastern picture at the present
time has a decided crimson tinge—
coming from the Red Machine of
Cornell. The Ithacans are three deep
J in every position and a top heavy
j favorite to walk off with the Ivy
League crown. Their big game is
, Ohio State, and if they get by the
I Buckeyes, they should remain un
j defeated.
Most nf Cornell's competition will
come from the Princeton Tigers. If
Davie Allerdice's magic arm remains
I ir.tact throughout the season, he may
! pitch the Tigers to prominence. Be-
I hind Princeton comes Fordham. Al
| though the Rams are weak in line
| material, with break-away backs
like Len Eshmont and Jim Blumen
stock, they will trouble the best of
:he Eastern teams.
Pennsylvania boasts of Francis
Reagan, who is one of the East's
finest backs. Outside Reagan, the
! Quakers have little to recommend
j them. Harvard and Yale will both
! be about as weak as last year.
But from the East come rumors
1 of a dark horse—Boston College.

Last year, the Eagles swept through
their regular season without a single
loss, but lost to Clemson on New
Years day. From this team only four
regulars will bo missing, so Boston
should have another undefeated year.
THE MID-WEST
The Mid-Western picture presents
a .naze of powerhouses. Topping
them is the powerful Michigan team.
