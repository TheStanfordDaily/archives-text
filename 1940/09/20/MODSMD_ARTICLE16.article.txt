# Enrollment Promises To Increase as Cal Drops 2,000 Students
## 
### BUD AMES 
Despite a supposedly indicative drop in the Univer
sity of California's student enrollment, 2,000 less, pres
ent reports from the Stanford administration building
foretell as large, possibly a larger Farm enrollment
than in 1939-40.
An estimated 4,200 students will cram the Admin-

•istration Building Monday and Tuesr
day, Sept. 23 and 24, to register for
fall quarter classes.
QUOTA FILLED
The fixed quota of 450 new lower
division men and 250 new women has
already been filled, according to
Karl M. Cowdery, associate registrar.
One hundred and ninety-four new
upper division men have already
been accepted, with that number
expected to increase. Approximately
45 new upper division women have
been accepted.
"Perhaps a few less applications
for rooms have come to this office
so far," said Mrs. Hoff, secretary to
the Dean of Men, "out since the in
troduction of the Fish Amendment
into the conscription bill, there are
indications that many hesitants will
seek the advantage of a college edu
cation. The halls will be filled."
APPLICATIONS INCREASE
Miss Mary Yost, dean of women
reports even more favorably. "Our
application for women's rooms have
increased over last year," she said.
"Since former Comptroller Almon
Roth is moving, we are converting
his former home into another hall to
take care of part of the increased
women enrollment."
All new students, freshman or
transfer, will register in the Admin
istration Building Monday, Sept. 23,
from 8 to 5 o'clock. Care should be
taken by these new students in as
certaining that they go to the proper
window, which are marked alpha
betically, when requesting their reg
istration books.
If you follow a few simple rules,
the process of registration will be
greatly speeded up and much less
confused," added Mr. Cowdery.
"After paying the necessary fees,
carefully fill out all 15 pages of your
registration book. Check the black
board in the Administration lobby
for information concerning required
seat cards. Several advisors will be
seated in the building to assist you
in case of confusion."
TIME SCHEDULES
After completing scholastic regis
tration, all new students should sign
for physical education courses.
Time Schedules, on sale in Ad
ministration Building, will greatly
facilitate the selection and arrange
ment of classes.
Late registration brings a fine of
$2 for the first two days. The same
holds true for registration in physi
cal education courses.
Old students will register the fol
lowing day, Sept. 24, from 8 to 5
o'clock.

troduction of the Fish Amendment
into the conscription bill, there are
indications that many hesitants will
seek the advantage of a college edu
cation. The halls will be filled."
APPLICATIONS INCREASE
Miss Mary Yost, dean of women
reports even more favorably. "Our
application for women's rooms have
