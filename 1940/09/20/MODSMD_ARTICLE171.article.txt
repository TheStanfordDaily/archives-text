# Fourteen Records Broken at Fresno
## 
### 
Twelve world records have been
broken on the Fresno State College
Stadium track in the past fourteen
years. Two interscholastic world rec
ords also have been broken.
Fresno pioneered night track and
field, with the West Coast Relays
the first and still the only major
relays held at night. Night track
was begun at Fresno in 1930, and
since then many big meets have
turned to night events.
