# MRS. STANFORD SAW SMOKE
## 
### 
During Stanford's first financial
trials after the death of Leland Stan
ford, Sr., Mrs. Stanford, during her
trips to the University, would anx
iously sit by the window of her rail
way car in an endeavor to catch sight
of the smoke issuing from the
school's heating plant. If the smoke
was seen she would settle back se
cure in the knowledge that the Uni
versity was still operating.
