### ROBERT LOW 
JjISTORY . . . 1940 during the
months of June, July, and Aug
ust reveals an amazing transforma
tion in the attitude of the people of
the United States—a transformation
from an attitude of complacency to
a realization that to retain its liber
lies a free people must be prepared
to resist with force attempts to
wrest these liberties from her.
In the words of Major George
Fielding Eliot, he "who would live
in this world, who would have pos
sessions, who would call himself
free, who strive to progress to higher
things, must arm (spiritually as well
as physically) to defend his life, his
possessions, his freedom, and his as
pirations from those who would oth
erwise wrest them from him."

The succession of Nazi victories
culminating in the overthrow of
France has been the background of
the growth of this realization in the
United States. Until the defeat of
France, there remained in our coun
try a widespread attitude of confi
dence, a faith in our destiny, that
was paralleled by the attitude of mil
lions of Frenchmen before the col
lapse of their country. Americans
looked upon the Atlantic and Pacific
Oceans as Frenchmen looked upon
the Maginot Line—symbols of the
invincibility of their nations. Today,
France has fallen and her Maginot
Line, a symbol of faith in a demo
cratic victory of her people, lies
shattered like her armies for the
free world to see.
America's transformation in atti
tude during the past three months is
reflected in her Congress, which re
mains in Washington preparing
America's answer to those who
would wrest her liberties from her.

answer — While the
British continue to withstand
great Nazi raids, Americans, and es
pecially Congressional leaders bet
ter informed through the State De
partment, are preparing for the
worst—the over-running of the Brit
ish Isles by Nazi armed forces and
the sinking or the capture of the
British fleet. Government rearma
ment, under the direction of a Na
tional Advisory Defense Committee
appointed by the President in mid
summer, will cost more than 10 bil
lion dollars.
According to present plans, the
fleet will be 70 per cent greater in
power when the program is com
pleted. The U. S. will have separate
fleets in the Atlantic and in the Pa
cific—the so-called two ocean navy.
Bases have been secured in Brit
ish possessions along the Atlantic
Coast and in the Caribbean, which
will form a defensive ring around
the North American continent and
the Panama Canal on the Atlantic
seaboard. The British received 50
reconditioned World War I destroy
ers in exchange for the bases.

An army of 1,200,000 men is being
mapped. Plans call for 25,000 planes.
The President has already sum
moned into training for the period of
one year several thousand national
guardsmen. Selective compulsory
military training is in the offing and
some 800,000 young men are likely to
be in training camps within the next
12 months. The rearmament pro
gram has brought an industrial
boom to many sections of the coun
try and the purchasing power of the
nation is already showing this in a
slow upswing.

VV/HTLE preparing for a frontal at
tack, Congress has not neglect
ed to provide for defense against
totalitarian propaganda and fifth col
umn techniques. The Federal Bu
reau of Investigation has been ex
panded expressly for this purpose
and a special counter-espionage di
vision has been instituted. The
registration of aliens within the
United States is another part of this
program.

The Havana Conference may be
listed as complementary to our ac
tual defense program. Secretary of
State Hull summed up the achieve
ments of the conference:
"The agreements have cleared the
decks for effective action wherever
.such action may become necessary."
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION—The
Iwo major political parties have
placed their respective candidates
before the public. Note the simi
larity of the attitudes on foreign pol- j
icy and defense of Wendell Willkie i
and Franklin Roosevelt. The Amer
ican people as a whole are satisfied
with the candidates' "all aid short of
war" statements, and Mr. Hitler can
not be jubilant over the outcome of
our election.
SIGNIFICANCE-As this observer
sees it, America is no longer isolated
from war in Europe, in Asia, or in
Africa. Our national history will no
longer be merely the history of our
people to determine their own ;
course. Action in the rest of the I
world will have a profound influence j
in determining this course. We shall j
have to think as a world power and j
the retention of our liberties will de- |
pend upon our preparations to meet j
force with force.
