# Hoover Library Dome to House Belgian Chimes
## Workmen to Complete Structure by End Of Autumn Quarter 
### GEORGE HISLOP 
In place of the 124-foot square
hole extant a year ago, stands a 274-
foot masterpiece of construction
which is to house the $lOO,OOO Bel
gian Carillon.
The chimes now situated in the
tower of the Belgian Pavilion at the
New York World's Fair will be
moved to the new Hoover Library
of War, Revolution and Peace as soon
as the tower is completed and the
Fair is closed.
The bells are a gift of the Belgian
people to Herbert Hoover as a token
of their gratitude for his service in
Belgian relief during the last World
War.
MOST NEARLY PERFECT
Completed in 1938, the carillon is
considered one of the most nearly
perfect in existence, with an as
semblage of bells larger than any
other in the United States. The bells,
which are electrically operated, pos
sess an unusually clear and perfect
tone, according to Miss Bernice
Miller, secretary to Mr. Hoover.
Construction on the library itself
has reached the slow point, accord
ing to John Leavers, superintendent
of construction.
There are some 50 men working
on the job, at present engaged in
plastering both the interior and the
exterior and installing the plumbing
and electric wiring. The next step is
that of putting in the trim, wood
work, and tile. The building is ex
pected to be completed by the end
of the quarter.
SECRET DOCUMENTS
The building will house the larg
est collection of war-time documents
gathered since 1914 from the secret
files of the Allied and Central Pow
ers. Ex-President Hoover began the
collection after the Armistice when
he received the library of Great
Britain's Ministry of Informatioft.
In addition to the five million doc
uments already gathered, Dr. Ralph
Haswell Lutz, professor of history
and director of the library, brought
back from Europe about 70,000 works
on German economics and propa
ganda methods.
The building will also contain Dr.
Ray Lyman Wilbur's collection on
social problems, the Hoover personal
archives, the Russian Revolution In
stitute, and the German Revolution
Institute.
