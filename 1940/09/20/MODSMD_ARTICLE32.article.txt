# Second CAA Training Period Slated for October; Fees Cut
## 
### 
Eighty Stanford students, including four women, remained on campus
last summer to take advantage of the free flight training offered by the
government's Civilian Aeronautics Authority.
Ground school instruction, which moved parallel with actual flying
training, was under the hands of Professors David L. Webster and Norris E.

Bradbury of the Physics Depart
ment, as was the case during last
spring quarter.
Sixty students comprised the Pri
mary Program which gave flying in
struction in light Piper Cub planes.
For graduation, these students must
fly from 35 to 50 hours in these
planes, doing dual and solo work in
all the basic maneuvers.
FARM AIDS TESTING
The remaining 20 were entered in
the Research Program, an experi
mental program being carried on by
the government to test whether stu
dents learn faster by beginning in a
two-control unorthodox Ercoupe and
then shifting into the usual Piper
Cubs after 15 hours of flight. This
program is still under way so no
definite conclusions have been
reached by the government.
Stanford is the only university in
the United States in which the gov
ernment is testing this Research Pro
gram.
Of the primary group, three stu
dents have already received their
private pilot's license, the goal of the
students. They are: Charles Cotton,
Robert Gooch, and Granville Wood.
NEW TRAINING PERIOD
Instruction in the primary group
should continue until about October
1, but the Research Group will con
tinue working indefinitely.
The University and the govern
ment plan to begin another similar
training period, open to qualified
registered men and women students,
about the middle of this October.
Eight units of university credit will
be given, and the syllabus fee, not
released yet by the government, will
be less than the $40 charged last
year. The ground course requires a
little more than 72 hours of work.
EXAMINATIONS RIGID
Flying training will be done at the
Palo Alto Airport. In order to qual
ify, students must be registered in
Stanford and must pass rigid physi
cal examinations. Eyes must be 20-
20 perfect sight without corrections.
More detailed information may be
obtained from Professor Webster,
Professor Bradbury, or Miss Steiner
in the Physics Building.

ernment is testing this Research Pro
gram.
Of the primary group, three stu
dents have already received their
private pilot's license, the goal of the
students. They are: Charles Cotton,
Robert Gooch, and Granville Wood.
NEW TRAINING PERIOD
Instruction in the primary group
should continue until about October
1, but the Research Group will con
tinue working indefinitely.
The University and the govern
ment plan to begin another similar
training period, open to qualified
registered men and women students,
about the middle of this October.
Eight units of university credit will
be given, and the syllabus fee, not
released yet by the government, will
be less than the $40 charged last
year. The ground course requires a
little more than 72 hours of work.
EXAMINATIONS RIGID
Flying training will be done at the
Palo Alto Airport. In order to qual
ify, students must be registered in
Stanford and must pass rigid physi
cal examinations. Eyes must be 20-
20 perfect sight without corrections.
More detailed information may be
obtained from Professor Webster,
Professor Bradbury, or Miss Steiner
in the Physics Building.
Eighty Stanford students, including four women, remained on campus
last summer to take advantage of the free flight training offered by the
government's Civilian Aeronautics Authority.
Ground school instruction, which moved parallel with actual flying
training, was under the hands of Professors David L. Webster and Norris E.

Bradbury of the Physics Depart
ment, as was the case during last
spring quarter.
Sixty students comprised the Pri
mary Program which gave flying in
struction in light Piper Cub planes.
For graduation, these students must
fly from 35 to 50 hours in these
planes, doing dual and solo work in
all the basic maneuvers.
FARM AIDS TESTING
The remaining 20 were entered in
the Research Program, an experi
mental program being carried on by
the government to test whether stu
dents learn faster by beginning in a
two-control unorthodox Ercoupe and
then shifting into the usual Piper
Cubs after 15 hours of flight. This
program is still under way so no
definite conclusions have been
reached by the government.
