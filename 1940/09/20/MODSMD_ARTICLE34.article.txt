# Minnows 'Heckle' Gull Lake Trout
## 
### 
The trout of Gull Lake are going
to be rid of the minnows who have
been annoying their peace of mind
and spoiling their appetites. At least
an attempt is to be made to straight
en things out.
Gull Lake, a favorite fishing spot
for California sportsmen in the high
Sierras, is infested with the min
nows. The fishermen are more or
less to blame. They've used min
nows for bait and the minnows have
escaped and multiplied.
