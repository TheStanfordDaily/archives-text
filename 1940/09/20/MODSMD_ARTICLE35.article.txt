# Wilbur Joins Educators In Draft Study
## President Refuses Definite Statement On Conscription 
### 
Although he prefers to make no
definite statement concerning the
present conscription bill, Dr. Ray Ly
man Wilbur favors a program which
allows youth to continue its studies
at the same time it receives military
training, does not greatly change its
former manner of life, and does not
involve a "lessening of moral re
straints."
According to Dr. Wilbur, who is
making a study of the current situa
tion along with other prominent
American educators, it would be well
for the United States to give some
study to the system of Student Army
Training Camps which were estab
lished at 551 universities, colleges,
and technical schools during the last
war.
RECALLS TRAINING CAMP
Dr. Wilbur was president of Stan
ford at the time the training camp
was established here. Under the ar
rangement, men students became
privates in the regular army and
were under the absolute control of
the military commander, although
academic authorities continued to
handle classroom and laboratory in
struction.
"The SATC placed Stanford, as
other universities, on practically a
military basis so far as its men were
concerned," Dr. Wilbur said in his
report for the academic year 1917-18.
The campus accommodated a mili
tary, a naval, and a marine corps
unit.
During the last war, over 100,000
trained men were transferred to the
regular army by the SATC, approxi
mately 70,000 of these reaching
France. Another 40,000 men were
ready for active service at the time
the Armistice was signed.
MAJORITY SEE SERVICE
Although the majority of these
men saw service with regular army
units, 2.4 per cent of them were
transferred to officers' training
camps, 2.6 per cent were detained for
paper work, and 4.3 per cent served
as instructors.
According to the program, the
army camp schools were expected to
continue during peace times to pro
vide a supply of specialists against
future emergencies, collect and or
ganize army trade data and technical
knowledge, keep records of civilian
vocational training facilities up to
date, and develop improved methods
of teaching.

trained men were transferred to the
regular army by the SATC, approxi
mately 70,000 of these reaching
France. Another 40,000 men were
ready for active service at the time
the Armistice was signed.
MAJORITY SEE SERVICE
Although the majority of these
men saw service with regular army
units, 2.4 per cent of them were
transferred to officers' training
camps, 2.6 per cent were detained for
paper work, and 4.3 per cent served
as instructors.
According to the program, the
army camp schools were expected to
continue during peace times to pro
vide a supply of specialists against
future emergencies, collect and or
ganize army trade data and technical
knowledge, keep records of civilian
vocational training facilities up to
date, and develop improved methods
of teaching.
Although he prefers to make no
definite statement concerning the
present conscription bill, Dr. Ray Ly
man Wilbur favors a program which
allows youth to continue its studies
at the same time it receives military
training, does not greatly change its
former manner of life, and does not
involve a "lessening of moral re
straints."
According to Dr. Wilbur, who is
making a study of the current situa
tion along with other prominent
American educators, it would be well
for the United States to give some
study to the system of Student Army
Training Camps which were estab
lished at 551 universities, colleges,
and technical schools during the last
war.
RECALLS TRAINING CAMP
Dr. Wilbur was president of Stan
ford at the time the training camp
was established here. Under the ar
rangement, men students became
privates in the regular army and
were under the absolute control of
the military commander, although
academic authorities continued to
handle classroom and laboratory in
struction.
"The SATC placed Stanford, as
other universities, on practically a
military basis so far as its men were
concerned," Dr. Wilbur said in his
report for the academic year 1917-18.
The campus accommodated a mili
tary, a naval, and a marine corps
unit.
During the last war, over 100,000
trained men were transferred to the
regular army by the SATC, approxi
mately 70,000 of these reaching
France. Another 40,000 men were
ready for active service at the time
the Armistice was signed.
