Announcement of a new policy for incoming freshman men was made
last week by Dean of Men John Bunn. The program will include meetings
ca< i week in bnciiia at which the freshmen and their sponsors will hold
informative discussions" on the various problems which arise during
the year.
I have always felt that there is a definite need for a follow-up of the

pre-registration program," Bunn <
commented, "and this system is a
crystallization of my plans."
Sponser preparation for the new
Encina set-up has been two-fold, ac
cording to Bunn. Preliminary plans
were made at meetings last spring,
and the sponsors will hold meetings
each week during the coming year
to co-ordinate their weekly pro
grams.
"Because there is no director in
residence at Encina, the sponsors
will have to run their own business
to a great extent," Bunn said.
Head sponsor at Encina this year
will be Bob Dodge and John All
tucker will take over the position of
secretary. Other sponsors will in
clude Frank Van Acker, John Porter,
Frank Knowles, Bill Niccolls, Lyle
Cook, Hugh O'Donnell, Bob Low,
John Pollock, Charles Bull, Frank
Weeden, Barry Binns, Joe Wilson,
Ralph Thompson, Bob Efteland, Bob
Morton, Bob DofTlemeyer, and Bill
Turner.
DEAN YOST RETAINS
OLD SPONSOR SYSTEM
There will be no basic changes in
the Roble sponsor set-up this year,
according to Miss Mary Yost, dean

"The sponsor system has been
worked out over a period of years,"
she said, "and is now functioning
smoothly and successfully."

winter quarters will be Mock Ray as
president and M. J. Montgomery as
head sponsor. Senior sponsors will
include Barbara Sweetland, Mary
Etta Farrell, Mary Beach, Lois Whit

Junior sponsors will be Irma Jean

All senior sponsors and the two
junior sponsors who hold executive
positions will live in Roble for two
full quarters. Other junior sponsors
will return to their regular living
groups at the end of the fall quarter.
Sponsors are also stationed in all
other women's halls to aid in junior
transfer orientation.
