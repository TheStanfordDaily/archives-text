# Work Started On El Camino Underpasses
## Construction Jobs Set for Completion By Winter Quarter 
### 
Work began this summer on the
$170,000 underpass at the intersec
tion of Palm Drive and El Camino
Real, with construction scheduled to
end in December.
Work is slightly behind schedule,
according to George Beckwith, assist
ant resident engineer of the State
Highway Commission, but it is ex
pected that excavation will be com
pleted December 4. The building of
the bridge was begun in September
and will be finished the same time as
excavation.
Contracts for the excavation of El
Camino Real and the building of a
, bridge over the highway were let
this summer by the State Highway
1 Commisison to the Union Paving Co.
and the Hepple Construction Co.,
with work starting July 1.
The $500,000 University Avenue
underpass, which was started last
November, calls for the sinking of
University Avenue, Palo Alto's main
street, below the Southern Pacific
tracks. During the summer the
Circle was prepared for excavation
and the framework of the new Palo
Alto railroad station was erected.
Because the University Avenue
underpass will not be completed un
til January, a service road has been
built to make Palm Drive available
to Stanford traffic. Campus traffic to
Paly will turn right at the highway
and enter town by Embarcadero
Road.
The University Avenue under
pass construction has been delayed
slightly by abnormal rains, accord
ing to Grant Miner, superintendent
of the sinking of University Avenue.
However, he stated that the under
pass will be ready for use by the
first of the year.
