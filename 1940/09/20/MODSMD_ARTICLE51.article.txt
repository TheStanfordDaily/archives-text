# HONOR

### 
An Editorial

One of the foundations of a gentleman is his honor, and here
at Stanford, more than at any other University, honor plays a
vital role in the lives of the students.
The Honor Code is more, much more than merely signing the
pledge after four hours of outpouring in a final, or signing one's
self in as being four minutes past the fatal two-thirty deadline. It
is, in force, an agreement with one's self that decent, honorable
living is a sure way to help repay the privilege of having been
allowed to live at all. It is in keeping with this spirit of men and
women who daily give their best efforts and in many instances
their very lives that the gentlemanly principles of human relation
ships may endure.
At Stanford each one of us who assumes the responsibility of
living here is given the rare opportunity of being able to keep
his bargain with himself and to live here, as nowhere else in the
world, with only his own personal, individual, and sacred honor
to answer to for his conduct. We at Stanford are inclined to
smugly forget that only in two other institutions of learning in
the United States does such a comparable situation exist, and this
is the freest and most unbound nation in the world.
This is not a vague, ethereal, mystical tradition that we have
learned to respect from our freshman days—it is, rather, a rare,
functioning example of how human beings can live together with
all their differences without having to be guarded and watched
and led along by the hand to see that they conduct themselves
honorably. No man should be driven or coerced into living the
way that he should and could live if he would only let himself
do it.
By preserving his honor a man allows other men to preserve
theirs, and by honorable conduct in all phases of his life a man
allows truth, justice, and right to exist without the use of force or
the trampling legions of military might.
Under such conditions, when the vital bases of human living
are being trod upon by ignorance and brutality, why shouldn't
each individual here at Stanford, alone and voluntarily, reflect
that we, simply by practicing honor and by accepting its respon
sibility, may even yet preserve the ideal of man's humanity to
man.—Ralph Burke Durfee and George Hislop,

The Honor Code is more, much more than merely signing the
pledge after four hours of outpouring in a final, or signing one's
self in as being four minutes past the fatal two-thirty deadline. It
is, in force, an agreement with one's self that decent, honorable
living is a sure way to help repay the privilege of having been
allowed to live at all. It is in keeping with this spirit of men and
women who daily give their best efforts and in many instances
their very lives that the gentlemanly principles of human relation
ships may endure.
At Stanford each one of us who assumes the responsibility of
living here is given the rare opportunity of being able to keep
his bargain with himself and to live here, as nowhere else in the
world, with only his own personal, individual, and sacred honor
to answer to for his conduct. We at Stanford are inclined to
smugly forget that only in two other institutions of learning in
the United States does such a comparable situation exist, and this
is the freest and most unbound nation in the world.
This is not a vague, ethereal, mystical tradition that we have
learned to respect from our freshman days—it is, rather, a rare,
functioning example of how human beings can live together with
all their differences without having to be guarded and watched
and led along by the hand to see that they conduct themselves
honorably. No man should be driven or coerced into living the
way that he should and could live if he would only let himself
do it.
By preserving his honor a man allows other men to preserve
theirs, and by honorable conduct in all phases of his life a man
allows truth, justice, and right to exist without the use of force or
the trampling legions of military might.
Under such conditions, when the vital bases of human living
are being trod upon by ignorance and brutality, why shouldn't
each individual here at Stanford, alone and voluntarily, reflect
that we, simply by practicing honor and by accepting its respon
sibility, may even yet preserve the ideal of man's humanity to
man.—Ralph Burke Durfee and George Hislop,
An Editorial

One of the foundations of a gentleman is his honor, and here
at Stanford, more than at any other University, honor plays a
vital role in the lives of the students.
