# WAR LIBRARY NEARS COMPLETION
## 
### 

BY THE END OF the quarter, Stanford's bid for a place in the sun will be completed. A year ago when
Fall Quarter started, what is now a scaffolding-surrounded, tile roofed tower was only a big square hole
in the ground. The Hoover Library on War, Revolution and Peace will also have another claim to fame
when it receives the world renowned carillon from the Belgian Pavilion at the New York World's Fair.
