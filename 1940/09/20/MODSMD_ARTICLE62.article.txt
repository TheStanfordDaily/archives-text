# Summer Plays Star Faculty
## Farm Helps Present Etheredge Comedy 
### 
Stanford's summer theater had a
busy season during the past quarter,
presenting two plays and two read
ings and offering extensive aid to
the Dramatists' Alliance in the pres
entation of the Etheredge Award
play.
First; on the summer roster was
Drew Pearson's "Mr. Congressman,"
a comedy of Washington life. Many
members of the University faculty
played leading roles in the play, and
with such success that the play will
be repeated during the autumn quar
ter.
WIIITAKER STARS
Professor Virgil Whitaker of the
English department took the lead in
"Mr. Congressman" and was ably
supported by Professor William
vis and Professor B. Q. Morgan.
Next on the theater list was the
reading of Wyeherly's "The Gentle
man Dancing Master." This perform
ance was sponsored by the Dramat
ists' Alliance, and both faculty and
students took part.
Another success of the summer
season to be repeated this autumn
was Oliver Goldsmith's "She Stoops
to Conquer." Again a combined cast
of faculty and students proved suc
cessful. The gay, eighteenth-century
comedy was an excellent vehicle for
costumes and elaborate sets.
PRIZE PLAY GIVEN
The Dramatists' Alliance sponsored
a series of lectures on comedy, and
presented the Etheredge Award play,
"Formula for Pancakes," by Muriel
Roy Bolton. The Bolton play was
an unsentimental, rib-tickling pic
ture of college dormitory life and
was presented by the Alliance with
the aid of the theater staff.
Off the campus, ten Stanfordites
organized a road company, "The
Roadrunners," and went on tour
through the state during the sum
mer.
