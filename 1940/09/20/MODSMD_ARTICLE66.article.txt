# McAdams Sparks Big Huskie Team
## 
### 
The Washington football team,
current favorites to t;:ke the Pacific
Coast crown, are pinning a large
share of their hopes on Dean Mc-
Adams. McAdams, who stands six
foot one and weighs 190 pounds, is
a real triple threat. Last year he was
the fourth largest ground gainer in
the Pacific Coast Conference, he
completed almost 50 per cent of his
passes and his kicking astonished
everyone that saw him in action.
But McAdams isn't the only ace
that the Huskies possess. Coming
back at center is Rudy Mucha, who
hits the scales at 210 and who will
come mighty close to being the out
standing center on the coast this
year. Another outstanding returning
lineman is Jay McDowell, who pa
trols the left end territory. Mc-
Dowell flashed as a sophomore, then
fell into a slump during his junior
year, but now he is bigger than ever
and ready to have his best year.
