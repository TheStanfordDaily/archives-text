# ADMINISTRATION GREETS NEW STUDENTS
## 
### 
Dr. Wilbur:
Each year we take much pleasure
in welcoming a new group of en
tering students to share our Stanford
privileges and responsibilities. We
love Stanford, and we hope that you
who are coming to us this fall will
love Stanford, too. We are looking
forward eagerly to what you can
give us, as well as what we can give
you.
Just as no civilization can long en
dure unless each generation adds its
share to the common store, so no
university can function as a living,
vital institution unless each student
generation with receptive and crea
tive minds gives of its youth and en
thusiasm and high ideals. A uni
versity must be more than a store
house of past knowledge. It must be
a lighthouse for the future.
Remember that along with your
registration books you will get the
Stanford brand, which will be with
you all the rest of your days. Dur
ing your student days wherever you
go, others will judge your actions
not as yours, but as those of "a
Stan I' ord student." And in the years
to come, even though you may have
been here but a very short time, the
newspaper reports of you, whether
lor good or ill, from the day of your
marriage to the day of your death,
will bear the caption, "a Stanford
man" or "a Stanford woman" did
this.
The branding iron of the Stanford
Farm is a good brand. There is
plenty of room here, good clean air,
and wholesome activities. 'The wind
of freedom blows"—but that doesn't
mean license. You can be happy
here without being childish. In our
laboratories, the library, church, and
theater, and in your contacts with
the professors, are intellectual, spir
itual, and cultural riches which are
yours for the taking.
We are looking forward to having
you with us.

Dean Yost:
To the new students:
It is always a pleasant duty to
welcome the new students to Stan
ford through the courtesy of The
Daily. But this year the pleasure is
especially keen. In the troubled
world of today there are few places
outside of this country where stu
dents can go for a year of normal
educational experience. We there
fore feel that you are a favored group
and most heartily open to you the
opportunities for training and per
sonal growth which Stanford can
give.
Especially do I want to call your
attention to the common interests of
the men and women at Stanford and
to the profits available.
Mary Yost,
Dean of Women

Dean Bunn:
It is with genuine pleasure that I
greet both men and women students
who will be registered shortly for
the Autumn Quarter of 1940.
Every year presents some crisis
in our lives and requires us to make
decisions. This year is no exception.
We should go about the job of effi
ciently preparing ourselves. This is
our foremost patriotic duty: To arm
our minds and manage our lives so
that we are ready to give in propor
tion as we have received.
The Dean of Men's staff is at your
service for any help you may need.
Best wishes and good luck.
John W. Bunn,

Dr. Tniehlood:
To new Stanford students:
You have come to this university
at a time of tragedy such as the
modern world has never before
known. The opportunity of study in
such a time entails a tremendous
responsibility. This responsibility is
two-fold.
First, there is the responsibility of
living now, of firtding interior re
sources adequate to the strain. For
most, these resources are insep
arable from religious faith. When
the human race has made a miser
able failure, as the present situation
indicates that it has, we need to find
a source of strength beyond our
selves.
Second, there is the responsibility
of preparing to share in the building
of a better world, a world in which
the sufferings and fears of our time
are eliminated. We need a new or
der, and it will not be made unless
the young men and women now in
training dedicate their intelligence,
their skill, and their imagination to
this end. .
Stanford is a place in which this
double responsibility can be seriously
undertaken.

To the new students:
It is always a pleasant duty to
welcome the new students to Stan
ford through the courtesy of The
Daily. But this year the pleasure is
especially keen. In the troubled
world of today there are few places
outside of this country where stu
dents can go for a year of normal
educational experience. We there
fore feel that you are a favored group
and most heartily open to you the
opportunities for training and per
sonal growth which Stanford can
give.
Especially do I want to call your
attention to the common interests of
the men and women at Stanford and
to the profits available.
Mary Yost,

Dean Bunn:
It is with genuine pleasure that I
greet both men and women students
who will be registered shortly for
the Autumn Quarter of 1940.
Every year presents some crisis
in our lives and requires us to make
decisions. This year is no exception.
We should go about the job of effi
ciently preparing ourselves. This is
our foremost patriotic duty: To arm
our minds and manage our lives so
that we are ready to give in propor
tion as we have received.
The Dean of Men's staff is at your
service for any help you may need.
Best wishes and good luck.

Dr. Tniehlood:
To new Stanford students:
You have come to this university
at a time of tragedy such as the
modern world has never before
known. The opportunity of study in
such a time entails a tremendous
responsibility. This responsibility is
two-fold.
First, there is the responsibility of
living now, of firtding interior re
sources adequate to the strain. For
most, these resources are insep
arable from religious faith. When
the human race has made a miser
able failure, as the present situation
indicates that it has, we need to find
a source of strength beyond our
selves.
Second, there is the responsibility
of preparing to share in the building
of a better world, a world in which
the sufferings and fears of our time
are eliminated. We need a new or
der, and it will not be made unless
the young men and women now in
training dedicate their intelligence,
their skill, and their imagination to
this end. .
Stanford is a place in which this
double responsibility can be seriously
undertaken.
Sincerely,
D. Elton Trueblood,
Chaplain ol the University




Dr. Wilbur:
Each year we take much pleasure
in welcoming a new group of en
tering students to share our Stanford
privileges and responsibilities. We
love Stanford, and we hope that you
who are coming to us this fall will
love Stanford, too. We are looking
forward eagerly to what you can
give us, as well as what we can give
you.
Just as no civilization can long en
dure unless each generation adds its
share to the common store, so no
university can function as a living,
vital institution unless each student
generation with receptive and crea
tive minds gives of its youth and en
thusiasm and high ideals. A uni
versity must be more than a store
house of past knowledge. It must be
a lighthouse for the future.
Remember that along with your
registration books you will get the
Stanford brand, which will be with
you all the rest of your days. Dur
ing your student days wherever you
go, others will judge your actions
not as yours, but as those of "a
Stan I' ord student." And in the years
to come, even though you may have
been here but a very short time, the
newspaper reports of you, whether
lor good or ill, from the day of your
marriage to the day of your death,
will bear the caption, "a Stanford
man" or "a Stanford woman" did
this.
The branding iron of the Stanford
Farm is a good brand. There is
plenty of room here, good clean air,
and wholesome activities. 'The wind
of freedom blows"—but that doesn't
mean license. You can be happy
here without being childish. In our
laboratories, the library, church, and
theater, and in your contacts with
the professors, are intellectual, spir
itual, and cultural riches which are
yours for the taking.

known. The opportunity of study in
such a time entails a tremendous
responsibility. This responsibility is
two-fold.
First, there is the responsibility of
living now, of firtding interior re
sources adequate to the strain. For
most, these resources are insep
arable from religious faith. When
the human race has made a miser
able failure, as the present situation
indicates that it has, we need to find
a source of strength beyond our
selves.
Second, there is the responsibility
of preparing to share in the building
of a better world, a world in which
the sufferings and fears of our time
are eliminated. We need a new or
der, and it will not be made unless
the young men and women now in
training dedicate their intelligence,
their skill, and their imagination to
this end. .
Stanford is a place in which this
double responsibility can be seriously
undertaken.
Sincerely,
D. Elton Trueblood,
Chaplain ol the University




Dr. Wilbur:
Each year we take much pleasure
in welcoming a new group of en
tering students to share our Stanford
privileges and responsibilities. We
love Stanford, and we hope that you
who are coming to us this fall will
love Stanford, too. We are looking
forward eagerly to what you can
give us, as well as what we can give
you.
Just as no civilization can long en
dure unless each generation adds its
share to the common store, so no
university can function as a living,
vital institution unless each student
generation with receptive and crea
tive minds gives of its youth and en
thusiasm and high ideals. A uni
versity must be more than a store
house of past knowledge. It must be
a lighthouse for the future.
Remember that along with your
registration books you will get the
Stanford brand, which will be with
you all the rest of your days. Dur
ing your student days wherever you
go, others will judge your actions
not as yours, but as those of "a
Stan I' ord student." And in the years
to come, even though you may have
been here but a very short time, the
newspaper reports of you, whether
lor good or ill, from the day of your
marriage to the day of your death,
will bear the caption, "a Stanford
man" or "a Stanford woman" did
this.
The branding iron of the Stanford
Farm is a good brand. There is
plenty of room here, good clean air,
and wholesome activities. 'The wind
of freedom blows"—but that doesn't
mean license. You can be happy
here without being childish. In our
laboratories, the library, church, and
theater, and in your contacts with
the professors, are intellectual, spir
itual, and cultural riches which are
yours for the taking.
We are looking forward to having
you with us.

To the new students:
It is always a pleasant duty to
welcome the new students to Stan
ford through the courtesy of The
Daily. But this year the pleasure is
especially keen. In the troubled
world of today there are few places
outside of this country where stu
dents can go for a year of normal
educational experience. We there
fore feel that you are a favored group
and most heartily open to you the
opportunities for training and per
sonal growth which Stanford can
give.
Especially do I want to call your
attention to the common interests of
the men and women at Stanford and
to the profits available.
Mary Yost,
Dean of Women

Dean Bunn:
It is with genuine pleasure that I
greet both men and women students
who will be registered shortly for
the Autumn Quarter of 1940.
Every year presents some crisis
in our lives and requires us to make
decisions. This year is no exception.
We should go about the job of effi
ciently preparing ourselves. This is
our foremost patriotic duty: To arm
our minds and manage our lives so
that we are ready to give in propor
tion as we have received.
The Dean of Men's staff is at your
service for any help you may need.
Best wishes and good luck.
