# Flags Once Flew Atop P.A. Tree
## 
### 
On September 8, 1908, and for
some time afterward a Stanford pen
nant and an American flag flew from
atop the historic tree that gave Palo
Alto its name. How they were put
there was a mystery and they re
mained until removed by the wind
and rain.
Thirty-two years later the inci
dent was recalled by Vincent Le-
Vesque, who returned to Palo Alto
from his home in Yountville and
confessed to climbing up the tall tree
and affixing the two flags.
The flag was donated by Jasper
Paulsen and the pennant by Charles
Lathrop, brother of Mrs. Leland
Stanford.
