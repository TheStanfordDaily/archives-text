My Dear Mr. Administrator:
Reports have reached me that some
young people who had planned to
enter college this fall, as well as a
number of those who attended col
lege last year, are intending to in
terrupt their education at this time
because they feel that it is more
patriotic to work in a shipyard, or
to enlist in the Army or Navy, than
it is to attend college. Such a deci
sion would be unfortunate.
We must have well-educated and
intelligent citizens who have sound
judgment in dealing with the diffi
cult problems of today. We must
also have scientists, engineers, econ
omists, and other people with spe
cialized knowledge, to plan and to
build for national defense as well as
for social and economic progress.
Young people should be advised that
it is their patriotic duty to continue
the normal course of their educa
tion, unless and until they are called,
so that they will be well prepared
for greatest usefulness to their
country. They will be promptly noti
fied if they ai'e needed for other
patriotic services.
Sincerely yours,
Franklin D. Roosevelt
