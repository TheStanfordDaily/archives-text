# Stepp Directs A.S.S.U. Funds
## Student Manager Lauds Publications 
### 
Richard A. Stepp, student-man
iger, is the man who knows where
your money goes.
"Two dollars of the funds received
"rom each $15 community fee pass
through this office," Stepp explained.
'I direct the student funds accord
ng to a budget made out by the pre
vious student-manager, John Cobb. l :
in my case, and approved by last
year's Ex Committee and the man
agers of the many campus organi
zations."
FINANCES GOOD
The community fees are divided
among the Health Service, 8.A.C.,
W.A.A., Daily, A.S.S.U., Union,
Clubhouse, and Theater.
"Most of the campus organizations
booking through the Student Or
ganization Fund are solvent," Stepp
added. "Generally speaking, a
sound financial condition exists on
campus."
SUMMER SCHOOL BUDGET
Beginning with the Stepp regime,
the student-manager has begun a
new practice, that of preparing a
budget for summer school students.
Their entertainment and extra-cur
ricular work formerly was not
handled through the student-man
ager's office.
"I particularly want to suggest that
more students try out for positions on
campus publications," Stepp con
cluded. "People never realize until
too late the advantages, both in fin
ances and in training, which can be
gained from work on these pub
lications."
