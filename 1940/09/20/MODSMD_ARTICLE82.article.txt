# The 						First Amendment

AS this paper is written, edited, and mailed
.to five thousand people, scattered gener
ously over the map of the United States, Stan
ford prepares to welcome its fiftieth class.
Tonight the lights are burning in Encina for
the current crop of freshman football players;
the last workmen have packed their tools and
left halls and houses ready for new occupants;
and the Corp Yard is filling in the last ditch that
has dissected the Quad like some giant, grim
fortification, making travel almost impossible ex
cept by autogiro.
Stanford, straightening its tie and clearing its
throat, is ready to say "hello" to a new class.
In a great many ways, though, the Farm is
much the same as it was when its first students
moved into Encina and old Roble (now Sequoia).
The most visible means of gauging change are,
perhaps, the number of new buildings, the in
crease in the 500 quota, and inevitable shifts in
styles of dress.
Basically Stanford today retains much of its
original love of independence, its belief in un
hampered thought and discussion, and its con
viction that criticism and evaluation are essential
concomitants of intellectual liberty. Proud of its
motto, Stanford is unafraid to quote, in a prej
udiced modern world, the words of a German,
Ulrich Von Hutton: "Die Luft der Freiheit Weht."
It is somewhat difficult to welcome this year's
addition to the Stanford Family. If the Farm,
once its formal orientation program is finished,
seems a little preoccupied, absent-minded or in
attentive, it will not be because Stanford is dis
pleased at greeting another class, its fiftieth one.
The blithe gaiety that swings along like a jazz
serenade during most of the year may wear a
little thin in 1940-41.
The scream of aerial bombardment, the roar
of bold, black headline type, the columns of
print and reels of celluloid that tell a story of
destruction, of man pitted against man in devas
tating strife, of the mouthings of war-mad lead
ers—these things cannot but encroach upon the
most isolated of Ivory Towers.
If Stanford's collegiate swing-song is dwarfed
by a larger symphony of horror, it will serve to
show one thing—that the outside world (here
tofore written with capital letters and spoken
with disdain) has invade the sanctity of the In
ner Quad.
There are some of us who are pleased to
think that Stanford undergraduates as a whole,
instead of a minority section, cannot avoid fac
ing a series of large and critical issues this year.
To approach these issues without hysteria, emo
tionalism, or a set of stereotyped ideas pro
duced by high-pressure propaganda, will take
courage and insight. More than this, it will re
quire thoughtful consideration based upon an
original premise that is fundamentally sound.
The University, if we are to believe its motto,
encourages intellectual liberty. And, through its
actions, it has sought to foster a critical sense, to
establish criteria for judging current proposals
in relation to past achievements.
In a v/orld where induced beliefs and
strongly-advocated dogmas are thrust at people
too unwary or too immature to see the danger
that lies in such regimentation, a university and
its student-body fill an increasingly responsible
position in the world's social structure.
And that responsibility, that high trust, is to
nourish the uninhibited discussion of controver
sial issues, the constant appraisal of policies and
theories, with an end to preserving what Amer
ica values most—its right to speak freely.
