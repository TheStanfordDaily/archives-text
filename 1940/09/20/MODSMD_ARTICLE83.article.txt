EVERY year a group of people, unsung, un
salaried, and unpublicized, sacrifices five
or six days of vacation and no small amount of
cash to return to the campus and manufacture
this issue of The Daily.
When sixteen members of the editoiinl r.t.nff

and five advertising salesmen came back to the
Shack on September 9, they began a job that
was completed only on Friday night after the
last 18-page copy had been wrapped and drop
ped into the mail on its way to you.
It carried, they all hoped, a complete story
of Stanford's past summer and its impending
yearâ€”administration, faculty, social picture, ath
letic developments, and student affairs. The
problems this staff faced in gathering news
when the Farm was virtually deserted, in work
ing under strict deadlines, and in meeting stand
ards of writing excellence should earn them
some sort of recognition.
This is a small way of conveying personally
that thanks. From the Managing Editor, the
Business Manager, and the Editor, to the Pre-
Registration staff:
Thanks.
