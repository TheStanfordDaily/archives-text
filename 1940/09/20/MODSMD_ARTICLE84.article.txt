# Evolution of an Idea

### 
WHEN it was created about five years ago,
Freshman Pre-Registration program had
few virtues except the soundness of its pur
pose. But, slowly, year by year, the Pre-Reg
process has been shaped into a useful, effi
cient and well-administered procedure for ac
quainting seven hundred new-fledged Stanford
ites with the 9,000 acres that will be their home.
This year's program represents the final re
finement of those earlier attempts, the latest edi
tion of what streamlined orientation projects
should be. With Chairman Jim Haugh at the
helm, a large committee of workers, picked ex
pressly for the task, will attempt to pave the
way for the Class of '44's initiation to Farm life.
Last year, and the previous year, polls were
held in Encina and Roble to determine precisely
what events during the week-end's round of
activity proved most worthwhile to freshman
participants. And, with the results of these in
vestigations, Pre-Registration workers have been
able to construct a more highly satisfactory
schedule, balanced fairly evenly between the
social and the academic.
Simultaneously with the growth in importance
of Freshman Pre-Registration, a comprehensive
plan to ease those first bewildering days for jun
ior transfers was evolved. The Junior Orienta
tion Program this year will be an important fea
ture in the associated students' agenda of early
autumn events. This year, as never before,
long-neglected transfer students will receive
nearly the same attention as more fortunate
freshman additions to the campus' population.
