# BULL SESSION

### BUD AMES 
MEET THE PEOPLE
fellow sufferers; a cultural, soul-stirring
dcxtrosy welcome, particularly to you who arc
smelling the Farm for the first time and beating those
vigorous black spiders out of your dormitory rooms.
The greeting sounds hollow and anti-climatic when
compared with literary spread given by President
Wilbur, Dean Bunn, Dean Mary Yost, Student-manager
Dick Stepp and the several Encina janitors on page
seven of this paper .... it really is, you know . . . .
but the old Bull-Sessioncr sends it from the bottom
of his draft-frightened heart. Take a look around. If
you sec something you don't like, make yourself heard.
If you see something you do like, you'd better get her
telephone number quick or Philbert Finkbop, '44 from
Oskamushee, Oklahoma, will.

J) rot hers and sisters, these are troubled times. Or
have you heard? The national and international pic
ture is clouded, to not coin a phrase. With the mis
sionaries of conscription, industrial mobilization, and all
the other 'ions on the march, it rather looks like the
government is holding the only kinged-man in our na
tional checkerboard game. A move in the wrong di
rection will get you jumped—by half a dozen military
tailors and as many conscription officers. A jump in
the wrong direction will make temporary widows out

The move which you have made, that of a strong jump
into college, is, to all appearances, the best in light of
existing circumstances.
Better to glean as much education as possible into
• our intellectual basket while the opportunity still lies
within our grasp. Running to the nearest recruiting sta
tion in order to get a jump on our neighbor, or taking
a dredging barge to the south Pacific to dredge up your
very own island would be little more than displays of
hysteria and panic of the what-to-do type. Verily,
little more. Nobody can predict what will happen next
week or next year. One thing, however, can be pre
dicted. An education, a completed education, is a
handy thing, just as handy next year as it is next week.

A II of which sounds like a travel folder or a pamphlet
i x put out by the University Administration. It's
! something to think about despite the fact that it sounds
| like a wee voice in the wilderness. The lct's-decidc-it
tomorrow antics of Congress are definitely effecting
j public action and causing public anxiety.
You can't escape the realization that we are plump
I in the middle of "It Ain't Love—lt's Conscription"
Week. From New York comes the report that three
mellowing garbage collectors, several nice old, old
ladies, and one used liquor salesman were trampled
j by a rush down 52nd Street for the marriage bureau.
Every year things get better at Stanford for the women.
First they have a two and a half men to one woman
ratio on their side, and now its the government. Three
cheers for conscription, patriotism, and short engage-
