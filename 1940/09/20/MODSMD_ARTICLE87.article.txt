# Liberal Education Praised In 'How to Read a Book'
## 
### 
"How to Read a Book," by Mortimer J. Adler. On sale at the Stan
ford Bookstore.
The sub-title of "How to Read a Book" is "The Art of Getting a
Liberal Education," and, after you finish Adler's book about reading
books, you will probably feel, at least for a time, like actually trying

to acquire a "liberal
Probably you've been thinking "col
lege" education and the above men
tioned "liberal" education were prac
tically synonomous, but there is
where you're wrong.
Adler is crusading for a return to
the old meaning of Bachelor of Arts
—a title which originally meant that
the holder had mastered the arts of
reading, writing, and rhetoric. The
author narrows his field to a cam
paign for better reading, because
if you can really read (and his defi
nition of the word is not to be taken
lightly), an interest in, and improve
ment of, your writing and rhetoric
will follow.
NO DALE CARNEGIE
This is no set of Carnegie-esque
helpful hints. Reading, to this man,
is something which takes years of
work and practice. Perfection is
nearly unobtainable. However, a
great, part of the value of the book
is that Adler makes perfection de
sirable.
Of course he is talking principally
about just one kind of reading—
the kind that increases your under
standing. This is the sort of reading
that few of us do. We read for fac
tual information, or we read for
amusement. In the first case we can
rely on memory not intelligence;
in the second we bring together
neither memory, or intelligence to
the task. It is nearly as passive as
seeing a movie.
DEFINES "GREAT" BOOKS
According to Mr. Adler, the really
great books are the only ones worth
reading for understanding. He has
no patience with those who content
themselves with reading about these
books, for his test of a "great book"
is whether it shows really original
thinking or not. If the book is origi
nal in its thinking, it follows that
it must be for beginners.
He suggests that a chronological
reading of books in the same field
will aid in understanding, for most
of the world's geniuses have known
"how to read a book;" and they have
read them too. For instance, if you
begin with Plato, and work down
through Aristotle, St. Thomas Ac
quinas, Leibnitz, Descartes, Spinoza,
and Hegel, you will find Whitehead,
Santayana, and Maritain's arguments
far easier to understand.
GIVES RULES
The rules for reading a book are
set forth- simply and concisely. How
well you follow them will determine
how well you read. By the time you
finish Adler's book you will probably
be willing to take a stab at it.
At the end he lists the "great"
books. You will find that you were
exposed to many of them during
Western Civilization. I, personally,
will wager, that the few who did read
them cannot recall one train of rea
soning with conclusion from any one
of them.—Nowell.
