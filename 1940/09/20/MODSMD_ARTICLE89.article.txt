a fair price—usually between 60 and
70 per cent of the original value."
Owned co-operatively by 124 stu
dents who have paid the 25-cent life
membership capital subscription, the
Book Exchange in one year has
erased a deficit and now posts its
bookkeeping figures in black ink. In
its four quarters of existence, it has
sold 977 books and handled $1,626.37.
Of this amount, 80 per cent was
turned over to the owners of the
texts and 10 per cent was returned
to bonafide members of the Ex
change who bought books during the
period of January to April, inclu
sive.
Non-members are allowed to buy
and sell books through the Co-op,
but are not entitled to share in the
rebates. Any student or faculty
member is eligible for membership,
which carries with the right to vote
on members of the Board of Direc
tors and on questions of policy, be
sides a proportion of the rebates.
The Co-op has sponsored folk
dances and is planning a trip to a
youth hostel as an autumn quarter
activity.
None of the students connected
with the Co-op receive any pay for
their services. Any Stanfordite in
terested in serving as a clerk in the
organization is asked to report to the
Exchange's office the first few days
of school.
