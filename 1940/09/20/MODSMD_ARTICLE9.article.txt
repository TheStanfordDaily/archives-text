# Farm Honor Code Celebrates Nineteenth Birthday This Year
## 
### 
Paddling palms with a ruler wasn't the solution.
At least that's what a wise University Academic Council decided 19
years ago when it granted Stanford's famous Honor Code to the student
body.
A petition from 1,700 students didn't exactly retard matters, either.

, So, speaking of anniversaries, the
Stanford Indian this year puts an
other notch in his tomahawk, cele
brating the nineteenth birthday of
the Honor Code.
Recognition of their ability for
self-government has found Stanford
men and women highly appreciative
during every one of those 19 years.
They figured they were no longer
insurgent squirts sporting dunce caps
down in the grades, and the success
their Code has enjoyed attests that
they reckoned correctly.
HOLDS A TRUST
One of the few institutions boast
ing this mutual trust between ad
ministration and student body, and
among all students, Stanford depends
on the Men's and Women's Councils
for enforcement.
Under Chairman Nell Plopper of
the Women's Council are Barbara
Sweetland, Carlotta Haines, Isabel
Gore and Anne Killefer, while the
men's group is composed of Hugh
O'Donnell, Wilson Cannon, Edgar
Stein and Jerry Mayer, under Chair
man Roy Trowbridge.
Burroughs Anderson, last year's
Men's Council chairman, has drawn
up a new syllabus on the Code
which is to be distributed among the
frosh.
Standfordites raise their eyebrows
at any "conduct unbecoming a Stan
ford man or woman," but they do not
shut their eyes. Reporting a viola
tion is not considered as running to
mother.
Specific violations of the Honor
Code are examination cheating, dis
regarding library rules, plagiarism,
use of another person's composition,
and handing in identical material for
two courses.
