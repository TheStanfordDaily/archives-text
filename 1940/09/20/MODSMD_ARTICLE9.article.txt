# Farm Honor Code Celebrates Nineteenth Birthday This Year
## 
### 
Paddling palms with a ruler wasn't the solution.
At least that's what a wise University Academic Council decided 19
years ago when it granted Stanford's famous Honor Code to the student
body.
A petition from 1,700 students didn't exactly retard matters, either.

, So, speaking of anniversaries, the
Stanford Indian this year puts an
other notch in his tomahawk, cele
brating the nineteenth birthday of
the Honor Code.
Recognition of their ability for
self-government has found Stanford
men and women highly appreciative
during every one of those 19 years.
They figured they were no longer
insurgent squirts sporting dunce caps
down in the grades, and the success
their Code has enjoyed attests that
they reckoned correctly.
HOLDS A TRUST
One of the few institutions boast
ing this mutual trust between ad
ministration and student body, and
among all students, Stanford depends
on the Men's and Women's Councils
for enforcement.
Under Chairman Nell Plopper of
the Women's Council are Barbara
Sweetland, Carlotta Haines, Isabel
Gore and Anne Killefer, while the
men's group is composed of Hugh
O'Donnell, Wilson Cannon, Edgar
Stein and Jerry Mayer, under Chair
man Roy Trowbridge.
Burroughs Anderson, last year's
Men's Council chairman, has drawn
up a new syllabus on the Code
which is to be distributed among the
frosh.
Standfordites raise their eyebrows
at any "conduct unbecoming a Stan
ford man or woman," but they do not
shut their eyes. Reporting a viola
tion is not considered as running to
mother.
Specific violations of the Honor
Code are examination cheating, dis
regarding library rules, plagiarism,
use of another person's composition,
and handing in identical material for
two courses.
Rummaging around in the attic of
possibilities for a more intelligent
system of regulation back in 1921,
leaders uncovered the Honor Code in
a system which had been devised for
the Stanford law school some years
previous and, dusted off and revised,
the 1940 Code remains primarily the
same.
The long arm of the Honor Code
is as far-reaching as the require
ments of Dr. David Starr Jordan,
Stanford's first president:
RESPECT EXPECTED
"Students are expected to show,
both within and without the Univer
sity, such respect for order, morality,
honor, and the rights of others, as is
demanded of good citizens."
As a result of their inheritance,
Stanford's students are not distracted
by pacing proctors, are free to leave
their exams for a few moments of
relaxation or a smoke off the Quad.
Professors are free to remain in their
offices to answer questions of stud
ents puzzled by exam questions.
AN IRON PLEDGE
"No unpermitted aid given or re
ceived," the pledge which Farm men
and women inscribe on the covers of
their examination blue-books, is cel
ebrating its nineteenth birthday, and
is, like the iron horse, here to stay.

tion is not considered as running to
mother.
Specific violations of the Honor
Code are examination cheating, dis
regarding library rules, plagiarism,
use of another person's composition,
and handing in identical material for
two courses.
Rummaging around in the attic of
possibilities for a more intelligent
system of regulation back in 1921,
leaders uncovered the Honor Code in
a system which had been devised for
the Stanford law school some years
previous and, dusted off and revised,
the 1940 Code remains primarily the
same.
The long arm of the Honor Code
is as far-reaching as the require
ments of Dr. David Starr Jordan,
Stanford's first president:
RESPECT EXPECTED
"Students are expected to show,
both within and without the Univer
sity, such respect for order, morality,
honor, and the rights of others, as is
demanded of good citizens."
As a result of their inheritance,
Stanford's students are not distracted
by pacing proctors, are free to leave
their exams for a few moments of
relaxation or a smoke off the Quad.
Professors are free to remain in their
offices to answer questions of stud
ents puzzled by exam questions.
AN IRON PLEDGE
"No unpermitted aid given or re
ceived," the pledge which Farm men
and women inscribe on the covers of
their examination blue-books, is cel
ebrating its nineteenth birthday, and
is, like the iron horse, here to stay.
Paddling palms with a ruler wasn't the solution.
At least that's what a wise University Academic Council decided 19
years ago when it granted Stanford's famous Honor Code to the student
body.
A petition from 1,700 students didn't exactly retard matters, either.

, So, speaking of anniversaries, the
Stanford Indian this year puts an
other notch in his tomahawk, cele
brating the nineteenth birthday of
the Honor Code.
Recognition of their ability for
self-government has found Stanford
men and women highly appreciative
during every one of those 19 years.
They figured they were no longer
insurgent squirts sporting dunce caps
down in the grades, and the success
their Code has enjoyed attests that
they reckoned correctly.
HOLDS A TRUST
One of the few institutions boast
ing this mutual trust between ad
ministration and student body, and
among all students, Stanford depends
on the Men's and Women's Councils
for enforcement.
Under Chairman Nell Plopper of
the Women's Council are Barbara
Sweetland, Carlotta Haines, Isabel
Gore and Anne Killefer, while the
men's group is composed of Hugh
O'Donnell, Wilson Cannon, Edgar
Stein and Jerry Mayer, under Chair
man Roy Trowbridge.
Burroughs Anderson, last year's
Men's Council chairman, has drawn
up a new syllabus on the Code
which is to be distributed among the
frosh.
Standfordites raise their eyebrows
at any "conduct unbecoming a Stan
ford man or woman," but they do not
shut their eyes. Reporting a viola
tion is not considered as running to
mother.
