# New Grid Coach Closes Practice Gates to Public; Promises 'Just Football'
## 
### BUD AMES 
Clark Daniel Shaughnessy, the
Farm's new gridiron coach, isn't
going to let anybody into his back
room to see what the football boys
are having. Practice, except in
rare, extremely rare, instances, will
be secret.
"If people want to see us play, why
don't they come out on Saturdays?"
the salt-and-pepper haired coach
clipped over his shoulder as he
erased his diagram blackboard. "For
the best interest of the team, we'll
have to keep the doors of the prac
tice field closed to the students and
general public most of the time."
That statement is indicative of
Shaughnessy's business-like nature.
.He was hired to coach football. He
[intends to do that, just that, with-
Kjjut the fancy fluff. And Shaugh-
Bksy, who was born in Minnesota
in 1892, knows his business.
ALL-AMERICAN
W?'While attending the University of
from which he graduated
in 1914 with a B.A. degree, Clark
won two letters in football, one in
track, and one in basketball, despite
the fact that he engaged in no high
school athletics. His charging play
as an end, a tackle, and finally a full
back placed his name on the all
conference and All-American team
in both 1912 and 1913.
Coaching came naturally.
"I'm not sure why I ever went
into this business," he smiled. "You
know—somebody comes along and
offers you a job and you say: that
looks interesting; I think I'll give it
a try."
MINNESOTA FIRST
In 1914, Shaughnessy assisted his
former coach, Dr. H. L. Williams, at
Minnesota. Tulane was the next step,
as head football coach and athletic
director, from 1915 to 1922 and then
just as football coach until 1926.
There, he says, Clark coached some
of his best players.
"The best runner who ever played
for me was Alfred 'Brother' Brown
at Tulane in 1922, '23, and '24," he
recalled. He paced back and forth as
he spoke. "And my best kicker was
'Peggy' Flournoy who averaged 53
yards a kick in front of the line of
scrimmage in eleven games. Which
is good kicking."
JAY WAS BEST
"The best all-around player I ever
coached was Jay Berwanger during
my first couple years back at Chi
cago University."
Shaughnessy came to Chicago in
1933, after six years as head football
coach and director of athletics at
Loyola University in New Orleans.
He coached in the Windy City until
he came to the Farm.
Bill Ellington, Farm track coach,
broke into the coaches' room.
"I understand you took my sugges
tion and bought a new car, Clark,"
the little man said from behind his
usual cigar.
LARGE FAMILY
"Yep, and I kept the old one,"
Clark answered. "There are so many
people in my family that I need two
cars." In addition to his wife, he has
a son, Clark Daniel, who attends
U.C.L.A., and two daughters, Marcia
and Janice.
"As to training—there is goirig to
be no fooling around, no smoking,
and no late hours if they want to
make my team," he added. "Foot
ball is no joke. I expect every man,
on his honor, to obey the rules."
In our team, Shaughnessy expects
Norm Standlee to be his most out
standing player.
