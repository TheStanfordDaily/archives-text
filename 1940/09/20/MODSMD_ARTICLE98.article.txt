# Frye Calls Boxing Prospects Bright
## 
### 
Stanford boxing prospects for 1940
look a trifle brighter, according to
Coach Clayton Frye. Although the
squad will not include any outstand
ing sensations, most of the returning
men are seasoned performers and
should win their share of matches.
Three mainstays of last year's team
will be missing. Gone will be Cap
tain Jack Rice, who fought in the
145-pound division last year without
suffering a defeat. Gone also will be
Doug Grant, an 165-pounder, and
Bruce Berg, one of the best feather
weights of recent years. Football
will keep speedy Hugh Gallameau

from participating this year.
Returning lettermen from last
year's squad in the heavyweight di
vision will include Yank Levin, who
won his match against California last
year. Levin will be cagier and more
experienced and should be tough to
beat. Also coming back is Don
Grant, who last year showed promise
of developing into a classy heavy.
Another heavyweight is the flashy
Johnny Ward. Whether Ward will
be back in school this year is still
doubtful.
The light-heavyweight division is
also loaded with returning veterans.

Leading them is Ed Stein, the all
university champion and behind him
are Jack Elliot and Mel Ellett.
Two promising performers, Tom
McMichael and Jim McCloud, head
the 155-pounders. Both boys bat
tled evenly all last year and should
be better than ever this year. Also
in this division will be Milt Vedder.
Frank Hewitt and Blair Hyde re
turn in the 145-pound class, John
Wilson and Dick Lyon come back to
the 135-pounders, Ted Doe to the
120's, and sophomore Terry Green
should give.a good account of him
self in the 120-pound division.
