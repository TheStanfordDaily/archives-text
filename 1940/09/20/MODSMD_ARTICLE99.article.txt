# Texas Aggies Set For Second Title
## 
### 
Texas A & M, last year's South
western Conference champion, is out
to smash an old southern tradition.
No team in the history of the con
ference has won the championship
two years in a row, but it seems that
the Aggies have a fairly good chance
to repeat, and wreck the tradition.
One very large strike against the
tradition is hard hitting John Kim
brough. Kimbrough ruined all op
posing teams last year with his line
smashing, and this year he should
be equally effective.
Added to Kimbrough is the fact
that the Aggies lost only three start
ers from last year's championship
team.
