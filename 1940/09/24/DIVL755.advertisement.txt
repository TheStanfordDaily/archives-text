At forty our grandmothers were usually prematurely old
and worn.
More often than not, a large family of children used up every
ounce of energy, and seldom did you find a mother who was
anything but a "home body." Women in those days were
more than middle-aged at thirty-five and forty.
During these last two decades health education, proper diet,
scientific care before, during and after child-birth, more
sensible and balanced living, have done wonders for the aver
age woman, in adding year* of health and beauty to her life.
Women at thirty-five now are at their best — they retain their
youth, beauty, interest in life and sports, and are far more
companionable mothers, wives and friends.
