that the United States
would do some more "trading"
with the British have been heard
more frequently during the past few
days. Yesterday a report came from
an obscure Chinese city that the
flagship of the United States Asiatic
fleet would enter the British naval
base at Singapore for repairs. Some
observers were quick to link this re
ported action with Secretary of State
Hull's public denunciation of the
Japanese invasion of French Indo-
China. This was the most likely
possibility.
But several observers placed
more significance on the report. It
lias been rumored for some time
that the Singapore base would be
leased by the United States from
Britain or that this country at
least would secure the right to use
the British facilities there. That
the United States has made in
quiries concerning the use of the
base was thought probable since
Hull, the British Ambassador Lord
Lothian, and Australian Minister
Richard Casey entered into dis
cussions of defense problems in the
Pacific last week.

Whatever the significance of the
report, if any, Hull's denunciation of
Japan's newest "expansion" indi
cates that the administration is much
more than casually interested in the
Japanese activities. Japan's attack
on Indo-China is certainly no direct
attack upon what the average
American would deem our national
interests. But Hull knows that any
change in the status quo here is a
direct threat to British control of
the seas surrounding the vital Dutch
East Indies. That the British main
tain this control is no more vital to
(he British than it is to the United
States. So while newspaper head
lines this morning continue with
their horrible tale of the bombing of
Britain, the administration in Wash
ington watches equally as intently
the battle of French Indo-China in
another part of the world.

IMMEDIATELY following France's
capitulation in June, the biggest
question in the minds of Americans
was the disposal of the French fleet.
Not until early in July did Ameri
cans learn that Britain actually
would take steps tantamount to war
against her former ally in order to
prevent the fleet from coming under
German control. Reports both from
Vichy, the lemporary French capi
tal, and from London yesterday in
dicated that again French and Brit
ish fleets were at battle. The re
ports taken together show only one
thing clearly, that the British have
undertaken to wrest Senegal, the
most important French possession
along the Atlantic Coast of Africa,
from the Vichy government. The
British claim that the Germans
were plotting to seize Dakar, the
colony's largest city. The French
deny this emphatically.
Another situation has arisen
wherein the British believed ac
tion against their former ally is es
sential. Senegal is located on the
Coast where the African continent
comes closest to the coast of Bra
zil in South America. In Nazi
ha'nds. the port of Dakar would be
an ideal submarine base for action
against shipping in the South At
lantic. Evidently, the British risked
further discord with France in or
der to make it certain that Senegal
would not fall to the Germans.

The Petain government at Vichy
called the attack at Dakar "worse
than the Mer-El-Kebir assassina
tion " in July when the British at
tempted to destroy French warships
at Oran. The Vichy report went on
to say that the attack was another
step in General DeGaulle's program
of fomenting revolution in all of
France's colonics. DeGaulle is the
French leader who has fought from
London against the Vichy govern
ment's submission to Hitler.
Regardless of motive, the British
acted again, acted in a way that they
would act only in a matter of the
utmost consequence.
