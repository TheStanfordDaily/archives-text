Hardly had the paint inside the
newly refurbished Daily Shack in
terior dried, and hardly had the
staff begun to revel in the joys of
indirect lighting, than a hasty dam
per was put on their enthusiasm.
The damper came from Linotypist
L. R, Batman, who disclosed the
gory details of the manner in which
he and Floyd Miller, press-room
janitor, caught what they thought
was a nice little baby garter snake
not five feet from the foundation of
the Shack.
Having evidently been driven
from the dank, unexplored region
below the floor of the Shack by the
unfamiliar odor of paint and the
noise of carpenters, electricians, et
al., all the poor refugee snake could
find was the much harder and more
solid floor of the Press Building.
While on his tour of exploration,
he was accosted by Messrs. Bat
man and Miller, who thought they
would catch the poor little home
less thing and have some fun with
their friends by putting him in a
box formidably labeled "Baby Rat
tler."
What they didn't know was that
the box was all too correctly la
beled and that they had actually
been playing around with a 14-
inch rattlesnake.
The snake was killed.
