# British Strike Back at Nazis In 3-hour Raid
## Germans Threaten 'Dreadful End' Ahead; Speed-up Promised 
### 
LONDON, Tuesday, Sept. 24 (UP).
— The Royal Air Force heavily
bombed Berlin last night, the Air
Ministry announced this morning,
following earlier indication of ter
rific R.A.F. blasting of German in
vasion bases on the French coast.
The Air Ministry said that strong
forces of British bombers attacked
important military objectives in
Berlin in the second successive
night raid.
The continued R.A.F. activity
followed by a few hours a warning
to Britons by the German radio
that "We are coming."
INVASION WEATHER
The French Channel coast raids
were described by observers along
the British coast as on a great
scale.
So thunderous were the blasts
that houses along the English coast
near Dover, 22 miles from the near
est Nazi "invasion bases," were
rocked.
As the German radio was heard
warning of invasion, the British
Channel was in almost perfect shape
for any crossing of Nazi troops,
tanks and other forces to the forti
fied British coasts.
'WE ARE COMING'
The Berlin radio announcer heard
in London referred to British spec
ulation that Hitler has passed up
his best chance for launching an
invasion and said:
"We can only repeat this, Britons
—don't get restive—we are com
ing!"
The Air Ministry described strong
British bombing attacks during the
previous night on shipping, docks
and harbor fixtures at Flushing,
Antwerp, Dunkerquc, Ostend, Zee
brugge, Calais, Le Havre, Harfleur
and Brest.
Other R.A.F. planes reached deep
into Germany to bomb an alumi
num plant norwest of Dresden and
railways.
