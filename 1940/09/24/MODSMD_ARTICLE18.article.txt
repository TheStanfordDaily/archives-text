### 
LONDON, Sept. 23 (UP).â€”Speak
ing from an underground shelter of
bomb-scarred Buckingham Palace
as German raiders swept upon
London, King George Monday night
promised his besieged people "our
friends in the Americas" will aid
Great Britain to fight on to victory.
The young monarch spoke in a
strong, firm voice which was car
ried around the world by radio as
air raid sirens screeched in the
metropolis.
Defying Adolf Hitler's alleged ef
forts to bomb the royal family and
government out of London, the
King warned that with the cease
less siege of bombs "it may be that
the future will be grimmer yet" but
that the British people must stand
firm whatever the punishment.
Bi itain s great cities now are in
the iront line of battle, armies of
invasion arc massed across the
Channel only 20 miles away and the
production of weapons must be
kept up "regardless of danger," he
said.
