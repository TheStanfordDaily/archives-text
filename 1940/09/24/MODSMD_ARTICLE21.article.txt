# 500 to Attend 1940 Reg Dance
## 
### 
Autumn quarter's registration
dance, traditionally one of the live
liest all-campus affairs of the year,
will draw over 500 couples tonight,
predicted Chairman Stan Glikbarg
late yesterday.
Featuring Byron Snow and his
Statesmen, the motif of the dance,
which will be held from 9 to 12
o'clock, will be "Summer Vacation."
Glikbarg has arranged to have ro
mantic lighting effects reminiscent
of sea-sides and moonlit nights,
with the mood being balanced by
bright and airy drapery decora
tions.
Sponsored by Cardinals, the reg
dance will turn its receipts over to
a special fund created to pay off the
principal on Stanford's $10,000 Boat
house investment.
Last year's reg dance, featuring
George Cavel and his orchestra,
drew a record number of couples
and Glikbarg and his committee are
aiming to establish a new mark.
"This is one dance that no new
or old student should miss," said
Glikbarg yesterday. "It will give
the frosh a chance to get right into
the swing of Stanford activities,
while the returning students will
be able to resume old friendships."
Members of Glikbarg's commit
tee include Pat Adams, Frank Van
Acker, and Jerry Mayer.
