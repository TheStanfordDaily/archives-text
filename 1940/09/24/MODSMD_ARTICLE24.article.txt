SAN DIEGO, Sept. 23 (UP).â€”
Lieutenant William T. Hulson, 27,
naval pilot of Coronado, was killed
today when his V-F fighting plane
crashed into the sea 12 miles south
west of Dana Point during a routine
gunnery flight.
Naval authorities said Hulson
"bailed out" of the plane but was
"evidently flying too low for the
parachute to properly function."
