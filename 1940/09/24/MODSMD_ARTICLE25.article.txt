Yesterday, 401 women signed on
the dotted lines in contrast with bust
year's total of 491, while 826 men
yesterday did their best to build up
their numbers to last year's sum of
874. The record high enrollment was
in September, 1938, with a total of
1.500 freshmen and transfers regis
tering.
In the midst of yesterday morn
ing's hustle, registrants were pleas
antly surprised to meet President
Ray Lyman Wilbur, who introduced
to them Mr. Joseph D. Grant, Stan
ford's oldest trustee.
Mr. Grant addressed the newcom
ers briefly, expressing the belief
that Stanford, like the giant red
wood Palo Alto, would continue
sempervirens, ever-living and al
ways young.
FIRST REGISTRANTS
Mr. Grant, together with Fresh
men Marjorie Gestring and Louis
Allen, the first members of the class
of '44 to register, posed for pictures
and watched Miss Gestring have her
fingerprints taken in front of the
Ad building.
Registration of old Stanford stu
dents takes place in the Ad building
today. All registration books must
be turned in by 5 o'clock.
