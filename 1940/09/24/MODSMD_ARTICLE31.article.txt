Japanese artillery fire was incessant.
Twice Japanese bombers concen
trated their missiles on the Langson
airport and the market place.
DONG DANG ABANDONED
French authorities announced they
had abandoned Dong Dang, on the
border, the point where fighting
started Sunday.
There was an air raid alarm in
Hanoi Monday when Japanese
planes crossed the coast en route to
Langson, apparently operating from
aircraft carriers, but no bombs
were dropped here.
A hospital train arrived from the
border bringing more than 100
French wounded.
The French insisted the Japanese
were responsible for the border
fighting because Sunday's agree
ment did not provide for entry of
the Canton army into Indo-China.
The French admitted they agreed
to discuss this question in the
future.
BOTH SIDES SUFFER
Fighting which raged at Dong
Dang, 100 miles northeast of here,
for two hours was halted after both
sides suffered casualties.
The Japanese were reported to
have attacked three French out
posts, at Dong Dang, Bin-Hai and
Chin-Ma.
French authorities here issued a
communique reporting the Canton
army had attacked the French after
receiving formal notification that an
agreement between the French and
the Japanese for Japanese military
and naval concessions in Indo-China
had been signed here. It was learned
here that Nishihara yesterday sent
an emissary by plane to the Canton
Army command that an agreement
had been reached.
