# Nazi Bombers Blast London
## 'Archie' Fire Fails To Stop Night Raid 
### 
LONDON, Tuesday. Sept. 24 tUP).
— German bombers crisscrossed
crazily in a moonlit sky over the
heart of London early today in
jfforts to dodge murderous anti
aircraft fire that filled the air with
Hying steel.
Bombs fell with deep-throated
roars and flashes lighted the sky
line on the 17th night of the siege
of London after the R.A.F. had
smashed and scattered in disorder
four fleets of bombers which tried
to reach the capital yesterday.
Bombs and vivid "illumination"
explosives smashed upon the me
tropolis after midnight in defiance
of ear-splitting anti-aircraft fire.
Suburbs all around London were
torn by bombs.
POST OFFICE BOMBED
High-explosive bombs dropped in
northwest London damaged two
banks, a post office and a block of
luxury flats.
Many incendiary bombs were
dropped on different sections of the
city. A number of them were tack
led by volunteer fire lighters while
the raider who dropped them was
still overhead.
A barrage of anti-aircraft fire was
thrown into the night sky as the
raiders bombed the northeast sub
urbs and then drove in upon the
heart of London.
Great bomb flashes lighted the
sky and the raiders, running a
gauntlet of searchlight beams and
shells of the "Archies," scattered
explosives everywhere.
USE FLARE BOMBS
The raiders dropped big calcium
carbide incendiaries in an effort to
| light the heart of London like day
and illuminate their targets.
The air-splitting fire of the anti
aircraft guns was unceasing.
Other bombs fell on the south
west suburbs in the fourth attack
of the day.
Revealing the nip - and - tuck
fierceness of the day's' air battles, an
official statement said the German
and British air forces each had lost
11 planes in the fighting, although
unofficial reports indicated 15 Nazi
planes might have been brought
down. Of the 11 British planes lost
seven pilots are safe.
FOUR FLEETS STOPPED
The four fleets of raiders beaten
back from London during the day
light hours were paced by a huge
four-motor bomber and included
"Stuka" dive bombers flying in
pairs, apparently bent on mass
bombings of London.
The four fleets of raiders, in
cluding one of at least 30 planes,
came in over the Kent and Essex
coasts and up the Thames estuary
where they first ran into heavy
anti-aircraft fire and then swarms
of British Spitfire and Hurricane
fighters.
William Martin, Jr., president of
the New York Stock Exchange, has
declared that all the institution's
employees between the ages of 21
and 31 will be considered on leave
of absence if they are conscripted
and will receive adjusted compensa
tion.

and illuminate their targets.
The air-splitting fire of the anti
aircraft guns was unceasing.
Other bombs fell on the south
west suburbs in the fourth attack
of the day.
Revealing the nip - and - tuck
fierceness of the day's' air battles, an
official statement said the German
and British air forces each had lost
11 planes in the fighting, although
unofficial reports indicated 15 Nazi
planes might have been brought
down. Of the 11 British planes lost
seven pilots are safe.
FOUR FLEETS STOPPED
The four fleets of raiders beaten
back from London during the day
light hours were paced by a huge
four-motor bomber and included
"Stuka" dive bombers flying in
pairs, apparently bent on mass
bombings of London.
The four fleets of raiders, in
cluding one of at least 30 planes,
came in over the Kent and Essex
coasts and up the Thames estuary
where they first ran into heavy
anti-aircraft fire and then swarms
of British Spitfire and Hurricane
fighters.

LONDON, Tuesday. Sept. 24 tUP).
— German bombers crisscrossed
crazily in a moonlit sky over the
heart of London early today in
jfforts to dodge murderous anti
aircraft fire that filled the air with
Hying steel.
Bombs fell with deep-throated
roars and flashes lighted the sky
line on the 17th night of the siege
of London after the R.A.F. had
smashed and scattered in disorder
four fleets of bombers which tried
to reach the capital yesterday.
Bombs and vivid "illumination"
explosives smashed upon the me
tropolis after midnight in defiance
of ear-splitting anti-aircraft fire.
Suburbs all around London were
torn by bombs.
POST OFFICE BOMBED
High-explosive bombs dropped in
northwest London damaged two
banks, a post office and a block of
luxury flats.
Many incendiary bombs were
dropped on different sections of the
city. A number of them were tack
led by volunteer fire lighters while
the raider who dropped them was
still overhead.
A barrage of anti-aircraft fire was
thrown into the night sky as the
raiders bombed the northeast sub
urbs and then drove in upon the
heart of London.
Great bomb flashes lighted the
sky and the raiders, running a
gauntlet of searchlight beams and
shells of the "Archies," scattered
explosives everywhere.
