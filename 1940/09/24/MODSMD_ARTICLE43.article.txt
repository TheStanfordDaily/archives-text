## Republican: 
### 
SEATTLE, Wash., Sept. 23 (UP).â€”
Wendell L. Willkie, in a speech here
tonight promised to get jobs for the
unemployed if he is elected Presi
dent.
"The New Deal has let labor
down," the Republican candidate
told an enthusiastic crowd in the
Rainier baseball park.
Willkie resumed his attack on the
third term and charged that by his
failure to revive our economic sys
tem, Mr. Roosevelt is heading us
toward a totalitarian state.
"This is a critical issue. It is a ter
rible issue, when you stop to think
about it. We know all history pro
vides us with proof that this intol
erable load of unemployment and
debt must surely end with the de
struction of our democratic way of
life. II we go on this way we shall
surely lose those rights and liberties
which are so precious to us."
England has used horseradish as a
condiment since the 17th century.
