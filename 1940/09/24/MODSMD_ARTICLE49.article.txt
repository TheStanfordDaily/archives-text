# Thornton Expects Successful Season
## 
### 
Coach Nort Thornton was unusu
ally optimistic last night as he re
viewed Stanford's aquatic prospects
for the coming year. And he had
reason to be, with Marjorie Ge
string enrolled and Paul Herron
back in school along with Roy Vi
tousek and Howie Adams, stars of
last spring.
Between sweat sessions on his
probable water polo line-ups, chalk
talks, and interviews, Thornton is
busy laying plans for the Junior
Pacific Association Championships
to be held at Encina Pools October
4 and 5, a two-night show featur
ing the Cal and Stanford water
polo varsities and the comedy div
ing of the Olympic Club duo, Diaz
and Hadley.
