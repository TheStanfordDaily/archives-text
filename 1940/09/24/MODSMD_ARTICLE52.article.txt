## President Sets Up Defense Framework 
### 
HYDE PARK, N.Y.. Sept. 23 (UP).
President Roosevelt today set up
machinery to draft manpower for
defense of the United States and
assured 1(5,500,000 young Americans
who must register for service their j
civilian neighbors will make the j
final decision on whether they will j
be called for a year of active army S
duty.
Signing an executive order which J
creates the organization necessary j
for the first peace-time draft in ;
American history, Mr. Roosevelt j
gave labor, industry, agriculture, :
medicine and the professions equal :
representation on the conscription
boards of appeal.
CIVILIANS IN CHARGE
Civilians, rather than army men, I
will be in complete charge of the |
thousands of draft boards which j
Oct. 16 will register all men be- j
tween 21 and 36 years. The plan j
assures potential draftees that their j
own friends and neighbors will be
the final judges on their pleas for
exemption; that civilians will handle
all appeals; and Mr. Roosevelt him
self will be the only official em- I
powered to overrule the decision
of an appeals board.
The voluminous executive order,
61 pages long, virtually completes
federal preparation for the historic
draft which this fall will transform
400,000 young civilians into regular
army conscripts. Upon his return to
Washington tomorrow, Mr. Roose
velt is expected to send to the Sen
ate the nomination of a director of
the selective service system—ex
pected to be either Lieutenant Colo
nel Lewis B. Ilershey, who has
handled the preliminary draft
work, or Major General Allen Gul
lion, Judge Advocate General of
the army.
TERRITORIES OUT
Decisions of the appeals boards
will be final, unless reversed or
modified directly by the President.
The executive order includes the
first two volumes of draft rules and
regulations drawn up by Hershey,
the Department of Justice, and the
new draft advisory committee
headed by Frederick Osborn of
New York.
The original proclamation in
which Mr. Roosevelt declared the
conscription law was in effect spe
cifically excluded Alaska, Hawaii
and Puerto Rico residents from the
Oct. 16 registration. The President
is expected to proclaim a registra
tion date for the territories in a few
I days. i
