Leading the British naval and mili
tary forces in their surprise .attack
on the sun-baked French African
port of Dakar is a tall, raw-boned
Frenchman whose life won't be
worth a nickel if he falls into the
hands of his countrymen.
Upon the outcome of the siege of
Dakar depends whether General
Charles De Gaulle is to succeed in
his efforts to enlist France's over
seas empire in his "free French"
cause to fight on alongside the
British.
If strategic Dakar, a hopping-off
point for South America, capitulates
under the shelling of the British
fleet other parts of French Africa
undoubtedly will throw in their lot
with De Gaulle and the British
Empire.
SUCCESS IMPERATIVE
Should he fail and the British
warships sail away from the blasted
port, even those territories of
French Africa Which already have
joined De Gaulle will give him and
Britain little if any aid.
Thus, the siege of Dakar by Brit
ish warships loaded with an expedi
tionary or landing force of Tommies
and "free Frenchmen" marks a vital
point in the war for Britain.
If Dakar falls to the British, then
French Morocco and Algeria may be
the next objectives of the 49-year
old De Gaulle and his forces in an
effort to tear apart the war fronts of
not only Germany and Italy but
perhaps of Spain as well.
Italy and Germany, in their Rome
talks last week, were reported in

some accounts to have promised
Spain Morocco and some other
northern Africa territory in an effort
to bring her into the war. If De
Gaulle J starts cutting off French
West Africa, Generalissimo Fran
cisco Franco may decide that it is
time for him to step in and save
Morocco.
It is doubtful whether the British
warships would have opened shat
tering fire on Dakar Monday, after
rejection of De Gaulle's ultimatum
for unconditional and immediate
surrender, unless they were pretty
well convinced of their allegations
that Germany was trying to obtain
control of the Senegal port.
STRATEGIC BASE
German forces in Dakar, which is
only 1,500 miles from the South
American Coast, would be able to
spread their U-boat menace over
the South Atlantic and have easy ac
cess to South America. For this
reason, the British felt sure of at
least passive approval from the
United States of their strong action.
