# Co-op Book Exchange Starts Second Year on Campus Today
## 
### 
Starting its second year 011 Hie campus, Stanford's Co-operative Book
Exchange opens today in Room 15 of the Old Union. Students may trade
at the Exchange office between the hours of eight and five o'clock.
The Exchange was formerly located in the basement of the Women's
Clubhouse, but now, according to Chief Clerk Mary Alice Adkins, the

clerks will be able to wait on the
customers faster because of added
space.
The Book Exchange is owned co
operatively by 124 students who
have paid the 25-cent life member
ship capital subscription. In its four
quarters of existence, it has sold
977 books and handled $1,626.37.
Ninety per cent of this amount was
turned over to the owners of the
texts and 10 per cent was returned
to the bona fide members of the Ex
change who bought books during
the period of January to April.
Any student interested in work
ing at the Co-op should see Frances
Dekker, secretary of the Co-op, to
day. Members of the Co-op are
under no obligation to work in the
store.
The Exchange is organized on a
consignment basis which allows the
students to obtain higher prices for
their books because the Co-op's
risk of tying up its funds in slow
moving inventory is negligible.
Books no longer used on this cam
pus are being sold through the
Co-op's connections on other cam
puses at as high a price as can be
obtained elsewhere.
The Co-op is open to all stu
dents to buy and sell books, but
only members can share in the re
bates. Any student or faculty mem
ber is eligible for membership,
which includes the right to vote on
members of the board of directors
and on questions of policy, besides
a proportion of the rebates.
A trip to a youth hostel and folk

dances are activities anticipated for
the autumn quarter.

that can be readily sold through the
Co-op: Anderson, American Gov
ernment; Buell, Governments in Eu

The Book Exchange is owned co
operatively by 124 students who
have paid the 25-cent life member
ship capital subscription. In its four
quarters of existence, it has sold
977 books and handled $1,626.37.
Ninety per cent of this amount was
turned over to the owners of the
texts and 10 per cent was returned
to the bona fide members of the Ex
change who bought books during
the period of January to April.
Any student interested in work
ing at the Co-op should see Frances
Dekker, secretary of the Co-op, to
day. Members of the Co-op are
under no obligation to work in the
store.
The Exchange is organized on a
consignment basis which allows the
students to obtain higher prices for
their books because the Co-op's
risk of tying up its funds in slow
moving inventory is negligible.
Books no longer used on this cam
pus are being sold through the
Co-op's connections on other cam
puses at as high a price as can be
obtained elsewhere.
The Co-op is open to all stu
dents to buy and sell books, but
only members can share in the re
bates. Any student or faculty mem
ber is eligible for membership,
which includes the right to vote on
members of the board of directors
and on questions of policy, besides
a proportion of the rebates.
A trip to a youth hostel and folk

dances are activities anticipated for
the autumn quarter.
