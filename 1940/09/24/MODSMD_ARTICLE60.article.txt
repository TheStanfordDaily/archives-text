# Senate Considers Soldier's Status

### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 23 (UP).—
Debate over the status of soldiers—
both volunteer and conscripted—un
der the Hatch "clean politics" act de
veloped in the Senate today as repre
sentatives of the nine army corps
areas met to study details of the
forthcoming draft.
Sen. Carl A. Hatch, D„ N.M., au
thor of the statute barring political
activity by federal employes, told his
colleagues that in his opinion it
would apply to members of the regu
lar army as well as National Guards
men and reserve officers called into
active service.
But he conceded the status of
draftees is different and "raises a
nice constitutional question." He
said conscripts have no choice about
entering federal service, and said
this might remove them from the
law's jurisdiction.
