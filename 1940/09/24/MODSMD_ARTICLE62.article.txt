VICHY, France, Sept. 23 (UP). â€”
The rare wines which Sir Charles
Mendl could identify by origin and
year while sipping them blind
folded, seemed destined tonight to
moisten throats accustomed to cry
"Heil Hitler."
German occupation authorities in
Paris have requisitioned the wine
cellar of Sir Charles and Lady
Mendl, the former Elsie De Wolfe.
Epicureans rated it as one of the
finest private collections in the
world.
