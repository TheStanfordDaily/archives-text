# Service Men Fingerprint Registrants
## 
### 
Returning Stanford students will
today have an opportunity to place
their fingerprints on file with the
Federal Bureau of Investigation
Civilian Fingerprint Department.
Under the sponsorship of Alpha
,J hi Omega, national service frater
nity, a desk will be in front ot the
Ad Building all during registration
today.
Though G-men who were sup
posed to be present were all called
out on the de Tristan kidnaping case,
students handled the desk yester
day and did a rushing business dur
ing frosh registration.
The giving of fingerprints is en
tirely voluntary and prints will be
sent directly to the F. 8.1, in Wash
ington for filing along with those of
more than seven million persons who
have already given prints in Alpha
Phi Omega and Junior Chamber of
Commerce drives throughout the
country.
Prints are kept in the file for iden
tification purposes and are not in
cluded with the bureau's criminal
files.
"There have been many who
said that their prints are on their
driver's licenses," said Chairman
Louis Lengfeld, "but there is an ad
ditional advantage in having prints
on the federal file since those on
licenses are kept only in the state's
Sacramento file."
Men and officers at Moffett Field
are prepared for any kind of war
fare these days. They are now un
dergoing extensive training with gas
masks.
