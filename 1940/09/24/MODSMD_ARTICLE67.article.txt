# Stanford 'Roadrunners' Perform to Successful Summer Touring Season
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
A long lime ago, when an actor was something the decent village folk
regarded as a legitimate target for scurrilous remarks and well-directed
missiles, strolling players used to travel about the country, set up (heir
carts in likely-looking town squares, and tear ofT a miracle play or a
Punch and Judy show for those of the populace who surreptitiously
enjoyed their posturing.
But the hamlets were forgotten when the actors grew respectable and
graduated to real theaters and cafe society. But finally some of the actors

remembered their first audiences <
and set out to win them back.
Among these back-to-the-masses
actors were a group of Stanfordites
and ex-Stanfordites who formed a
company last June.
HUNT AUDIENCES
Fundamentally, there was little
difference between them and the
strolling players. They used vacant
lots instead of village squares,
trucks and trailers instead of donkey
carts to carry equipment, and they
had the softening influence of civil
ization to keep outraged citizens
from throwing rocks at them. But
they were playing where legitimate
theaters had never existed, and they
were hunting out their audiences in
stead of letting the star system and
high-powered publicity agents bring
the audiences to them.
Led by J. P. Kahn, famed at Stan
ford for his performances in "Lower
Depths and "Kind Lady," the group
fitted out a truck with a shower
and bathroom facilities, hot and cold
running water, bunks for the men,
lockers, a make-up room, a com
plete light booth, and an observa
tion car. .
USED TRAILER
Feminine members of the com
pany were housed in a trailer, but
they shared their accommodations
with an 80x30-foot tent (folded),
benches (also folded) seating 420
people, and all the properties, fur
nishings, and costumes. The trailer,
minus its paraphernalia, unhinged
at one side to become a stage 15 feet
deep and eight feet high.
Besides Kahn, the troupe included
Jack Dawson, George Wood, Vir
ginia Sharpe, Margaret Wood, Mar
garet Paulson, Gene Callnon, Fred
Clark, Harry Muheim, and Tony
Cefaratti. There were three plays
in the repertoire—"Yes, My Darling
Daughter," "Blind Alley," and "The
Late Christopher Bean."
Originally the group, "Roadrun
ners,' they call themselves, was
scheduled to play through Nevada,
Utah, and Idaho, but an unforeseen
circumstance brought a change of j
plans after a disastrous performance ;
in Carson City.
According to Harry Muheim, I
there hasn t been any money in Ne- |
vada since the Comstock Lode was I

worked out, and that night in Car
son City was the last straw. They
began the evening with a rather
futile effort to drive tent stakes in a
stone quarry. Exactly 15 people
tui'ned out, one of whom was a
very small boy. He came in for
nothing in the middle of the second
act.
Deciding that greener pastures
lay back over the Sierras, the cast
turned back toward California. They
came over Donner Pass.
"I think we made just a little
better time than the Donner Party,"
Muheim said musingly. "Carson
City and that haul over the moun
tains dragged cast morale to an all
time low."
HAPPY DAYS
But then things began to boom.
They played one- and two-week
stands in Auburn, Grass Valley,
Woodland, and Stockton. The Sac
ramento papers gave them excel
lent notices, and only a previous
booking prevented their playing at
the Sacramento Fair.
* Difficulties were many, including
the benches which were made to
fold so well that they did so with
out discrimination, occupied or not.
California's reception or the Road
runners has been so favorable that
they are going to continue their
tour on into December, without,
however, the services of Muheim
and Cefaratti, (he troupe's under
graduate members. And they will
hit the road again in the spring.
Financially, the tour has been a
success, and "what's more," Mu
heim says, "people liked us."

A long lime ago, when an actor was something the decent village folk
regarded as a legitimate target for scurrilous remarks and well-directed
missiles, strolling players used to travel about the country, set up (heir
carts in likely-looking town squares, and tear ofT a miracle play or a
Punch and Judy show for those of the populace who surreptitiously
enjoyed their posturing.
But the hamlets were forgotten when the actors grew respectable and
graduated to real theaters and cafe society. But finally some of the actors

remembered their first audiences <
and set out to win them back.
Among these back-to-the-masses
actors were a group of Stanfordites
and ex-Stanfordites who formed a
company last June.
HUNT AUDIENCES
Fundamentally, there was little
difference between them and the
strolling players. They used vacant
lots instead of village squares,
trucks and trailers instead of donkey
carts to carry equipment, and they
had the softening influence of civil
ization to keep outraged citizens
from throwing rocks at them. But
they were playing where legitimate
theaters had never existed, and they
were hunting out their audiences in
stead of letting the star system and
high-powered publicity agents bring
the audiences to them.
Led by J. P. Kahn, famed at Stan
ford for his performances in "Lower
Depths and "Kind Lady," the group
fitted out a truck with a shower
and bathroom facilities, hot and cold
running water, bunks for the men,
lockers, a make-up room, a com
plete light booth, and an observa
tion car. .
USED TRAILER
Feminine members of the com
pany were housed in a trailer, but
they shared their accommodations
with an 80x30-foot tent (folded),
benches (also folded) seating 420
people, and all the properties, fur
nishings, and costumes. The trailer,
minus its paraphernalia, unhinged
at one side to become a stage 15 feet
deep and eight feet high.
Besides Kahn, the troupe included
Jack Dawson, George Wood, Vir
ginia Sharpe, Margaret Wood, Mar
garet Paulson, Gene Callnon, Fred
Clark, Harry Muheim, and Tony
Cefaratti. There were three plays
in the repertoire—"Yes, My Darling
Daughter," "Blind Alley," and "The
Late Christopher Bean."
Originally the group, "Roadrun
ners,' they call themselves, was
scheduled to play through Nevada,
Utah, and Idaho, but an unforeseen
circumstance brought a change of j
plans after a disastrous performance ;
in Carson City.
According to Harry Muheim, I
there hasn t been any money in Ne- |
vada since the Comstock Lode was I

worked out, and that night in Car
son City was the last straw. They
began the evening with a rather
futile effort to drive tent stakes in a
stone quarry. Exactly 15 people
tui'ned out, one of whom was a
very small boy. He came in for
nothing in the middle of the second
act.
Deciding that greener pastures
lay back over the Sierras, the cast
turned back toward California. They
came over Donner Pass.

ginia Sharpe, Margaret Wood, Mar
garet Paulson, Gene Callnon, Fred
Clark, Harry Muheim, and Tony
Cefaratti. There were three plays
in the repertoire—"Yes, My Darling
Daughter," "Blind Alley," and "The
Late Christopher Bean."
Originally the group, "Roadrun
ners,' they call themselves, was
scheduled to play through Nevada,
Utah, and Idaho, but an unforeseen
circumstance brought a change of j
plans after a disastrous performance ;
in Carson City.
According to Harry Muheim, I
there hasn t been any money in Ne- |
vada since the Comstock Lode was I

worked out, and that night in Car
son City was the last straw. They
began the evening with a rather
futile effort to drive tent stakes in a
stone quarry. Exactly 15 people
tui'ned out, one of whom was a
very small boy. He came in for
nothing in the middle of the second
act.
Deciding that greener pastures
lay back over the Sierras, the cast
turned back toward California. They
came over Donner Pass.
"I think we made just a little
better time than the Donner Party,"
Muheim said musingly. "Carson
City and that haul over the moun
tains dragged cast morale to an all
time low."
HAPPY DAYS
But then things began to boom.
They played one- and two-week
stands in Auburn, Grass Valley,
Woodland, and Stockton. The Sac
ramento papers gave them excel
lent notices, and only a previous
booking prevented their playing at
the Sacramento Fair.
* Difficulties were many, including
the benches which were made to

out discrimination, occupied or not.
California's reception or the Road
runners has been so favorable that
they are going to continue their
tour on into December, without,
however, the services of Muheim
and Cefaratti, (he troupe's under

Financially, the tour has been a
success, and "what's more," Mu
heim says, "people liked us."
A long lime ago, when an actor was something the decent village folk
regarded as a legitimate target for scurrilous remarks and well-directed
missiles, strolling players used to travel about the country, set up (heir
carts in likely-looking town squares, and tear ofT a miracle play or a
Punch and Judy show for those of the populace who surreptitiously
enjoyed their posturing.
But the hamlets were forgotten when the actors grew respectable and
graduated to real theaters and cafe society. But finally some of the actors

remembered their first audiences <
and set out to win them back.
Among these back-to-the-masses
actors were a group of Stanfordites
and ex-Stanfordites who formed a
company last June.
HUNT AUDIENCES
Fundamentally, there was little
difference between them and the
strolling players. They used vacant
lots instead of village squares,
trucks and trailers instead of donkey
carts to carry equipment, and they
had the softening influence of civil
ization to keep outraged citizens
from throwing rocks at them. But
they were playing where legitimate
theaters had never existed, and they
were hunting out their audiences in
stead of letting the star system and
high-powered publicity agents bring
the audiences to them.
Led by J. P. Kahn, famed at Stan
ford for his performances in "Lower
Depths and "Kind Lady," the group
fitted out a truck with a shower
and bathroom facilities, hot and cold
running water, bunks for the men,
lockers, a make-up room, a com
plete light booth, and an observa
tion car. .
USED TRAILER
Feminine members of the com
pany were housed in a trailer, but
they shared their accommodations
with an 80x30-foot tent (folded),
benches (also folded) seating 420
people, and all the properties, fur
nishings, and costumes. The trailer,
minus its paraphernalia, unhinged
at one side to become a stage 15 feet
deep and eight feet high.
Besides Kahn, the troupe included
Jack Dawson, George Wood, Vir
ginia Sharpe, Margaret Wood, Mar
garet Paulson, Gene Callnon, Fred
Clark, Harry Muheim, and Tony
Cefaratti. There were three plays
in the repertoire—"Yes, My Darling
