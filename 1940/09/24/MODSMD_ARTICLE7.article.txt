# Frosh Registration Is Finale Of Busy Week-Long Program
## 
### 
Following completion of 1940's Prc-Rcgistration Program with Sun
day's barbecue on Stanford Hill. 700 frosh men and women yesterday went
through the rigors of registering.
While the class of '44 stumbled hesitantly through the labyrinth of
registration activities, returning veterans of Stanford's academic wars

>bided their time until today when
they sign up for classes.
Under the chairmanship of Jim
Haugh, the Pre-Reg agenda went
off smoothly with the jolly-up and
barbecue as the highlights. Haugh
vigorously discounted the allega
tions of a small minority of the
frosh men who claimed that an ex
cessive number of upper-classmen
crashed the jolly-up to get a line
on '44's women.
Noel Thomas' orchestra was on
the bandstand for the frosh, and
judiciously mixed swing for the jit
terbugs with "schmaltz" for the
smoother element.
At Sunday's barbecue, the frosh
ate barbecued lamb, listened to Dr.
Ray Lyman Wilbur read a letter
that he had addressed to his parents
when he was a freshman 48 years
ago, laughed at Dana Winters'
"baby-killings," and heard "Shorty"
Grannis give one of his imitations
of President Roosevelt.
Another highlight of the Pre-Reg
program was the welcoming as
sembly Saturday morning in Memo
rial Auditorium. After Coach Clark
Shaughnessy had previewed the
football team's chances for the 1940
season, Professor Harry Rathbun
warned the frosh that it was to
their own advantage not to abuse
the freedom they would find at
Stanford. Student Body President
Bruce Jcssup and Vice-President
Anne Townsend gave short talks
welcoming the class of '44 to Stan
ford's fold.
Other activities of the orientation
program included conferences with
advisers, talks by Dean Mary Yost to
the incoming women and by Dean
John Bunn to the neophyte men,
and "bull-sessions" with sponsors
on Stanford's cherished Honor
Code.
Working under Haugh on the Pre-
Reg program were 85 upper-class
men and the following heads of sub
committees: Encina activities, Bob
Dodge; Roble activities, Mary June
Montgomery; academic activities,
Martha Benson; assembly, Frank
Tatum; barbecue, Pete Whittlesey;
hospitality, Mary Jean Haynes;
jolly-up, Ray Durham; publicity,
Jerry Mayer; tours, Bob Snoddy;
organization, Lee Champion.

Following completion of 1940's Prc-Rcgistration Program with Sun
day's barbecue on Stanford Hill. 700 frosh men and women yesterday went
through the rigors of registering.
While the class of '44 stumbled hesitantly through the labyrinth of
registration activities, returning veterans of Stanford's academic wars

>bided their time until today when
they sign up for classes.
Under the chairmanship of Jim
Haugh, the Pre-Reg agenda went
off smoothly with the jolly-up and
barbecue as the highlights. Haugh
vigorously discounted the allega
tions of a small minority of the
frosh men who claimed that an ex
cessive number of upper-classmen
crashed the jolly-up to get a line
on '44's women.
Noel Thomas' orchestra was on
the bandstand for the frosh, and
judiciously mixed swing for the jit
terbugs with "schmaltz" for the
smoother element.
At Sunday's barbecue, the frosh
ate barbecued lamb, listened to Dr.
Ray Lyman Wilbur read a letter
that he had addressed to his parents
when he was a freshman 48 years
ago, laughed at Dana Winters'
"baby-killings," and heard "Shorty"
Grannis give one of his imitations
of President Roosevelt.
Another highlight of the Pre-Reg
program was the welcoming as
sembly Saturday morning in Memo
rial Auditorium. After Coach Clark
Shaughnessy had previewed the
football team's chances for the 1940
season, Professor Harry Rathbun
warned the frosh that it was to
their own advantage not to abuse
the freedom they would find at
Stanford. Student Body President
Bruce Jcssup and Vice-President
Anne Townsend gave short talks
welcoming the class of '44 to Stan
ford's fold.
Other activities of the orientation
program included conferences with
advisers, talks by Dean Mary Yost to
the incoming women and by Dean
John Bunn to the neophyte men,
and "bull-sessions" with sponsors
on Stanford's cherished Honor
Code.
