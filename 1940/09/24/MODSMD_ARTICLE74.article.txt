# Injuries Hit Card Squad; 'Swede' Lost To Team
## Every Position Hit by Withdrawal Or Hurts; Scrimmages Called Off 
### CHUCK SMITH 
With a hospital list mounting to alarming heights, Coach Clark Shaugh
nessy has called a temporary halt on serimmagos.
Every position 011 the team has been hit hy injuries or withdrawals
from school within the last seven days, and at the present rate Shaugh
nessy will he fortunate to have eleven men Ipft on the squad to field against

U.S.F. when the cards open their«
1940 football season next Saturday, j
Doug Stable, first-string center
during spring practice, has been j
called away because of a death in j
his family. At the guard positions j
Johnny Kerman, Claude Purkitt, Ed
McCain and Dick Palmer are on the
sidelines with minor injuries.
Tackles Bruno Banducci and Bud
Radditz are just now getting back
into shape after short layoffs and
Ed "Swede" Johannessen is plan
ning on joining the Naval Reserve j
for a year and is therefore lost to
the squad.
NOKBEKG LOST TO SQUAI)
Wingman Bill Willard is nursing a i
slightly strained leg muscle, Hank
Norberg has been lost to the squad
for at least three wpeks with a se
rious shoulder injury, Bill Symes is
out with a cold, and "Bosco" GrafT
has been in a dazed state for the
last few days from a bad bump on
the noggin.
And in the backfield the list of
absent and ailing is just as impos
ing. Keyman Frankie Albert is on
the sick list with a bad cold; and A1
Cole is laid up with a sore leg, leav
ing the ranks of quarterbacks rather
barren. First-string halfback Hugh
Gallarneau is ti'otting gingerly
around testing his gimpy knee, and
Red Robinson has been forced to
quit football because of an injured
ankle. Thor Peterson would round
out a team of cripples at the full
back position. Thor cracked two
ribs during Saturday's disastrous

scrimmage and will probably be
out for a month.
Just as disheartening as this list
of injuries was the Cards' perform
ance during last Saturday's scrim
mage. Three to four strings of var
sity men alternated against about 20
badly tired freshmen through four
quarters of action and were able to
score only four touchdowns.
BALLIIANDLINCJ DECEPTIVE
However, ballhandling in the
backfield was snappy and decep
tive. The main difficulties were in
the line where holes were either
closed before the ball carrier ar
rived or were never even opened.
And the varsity lost several scoring
opportunities on dropped forward
passes.
Yet Stanford grid fans are going
to enjoy their definitely new team.
The T-formation is new to the Farm
and rather unique on the Coast, and
it has plenty of snap and deception.
Shaughnessy employs a distractor
and quick opening plays to roll up
his yardage.
The Indians are going to be a
"double-or-nothing" ball club this
year, for they'll be playing a gam
bler's game. Every play can and
may go the limit if timing and ball
handling are just right, but if things
don t click it will be just another
attempt. And with this kind of a
running attack, Shaughnessy will
mix plenty of daring pass plays. His
team is going to play a definitely
"spectators' game" full of excite
ment and daring.
PLENTY OF ABILITY
The Cards have more than just a
new coach and a new system; they
have plenty of football ability. A
coach would have to look a long
time to find a crash-and-carry artist
like Norm Standlee or for a preci
sion pitching arm like Frankie Al
bert's. Then there is the speed and
trickiness of Pete Kmetovic and
Hugh Gallarneau—the line backing
of either the newcomer Vic Lind
.skog or Doug Stable at the center
positions—the heftiness and drive of
those sophomore linemen Palmer,
McCain, Banducci, and Chuck Tay
lor—the experience of Ken Robesky,
Jack Warneeke, Kerman, Chick
Orme and Graft'—and the tall rug
gedness needed for ends such as Bill
Willard and Ed Stamm possess.
Several sophomore backs have
been showing the old-timers how
it's done and may break into a regu
lar position before the season Ls
over. Ray Hammett filled in for the
sick Albert in Saturday's scrim
mage and performed well. Little
Eric Armstrong filled in for another
ailing first-stringer, Gallarneau, and
was one of the few bright spots of
the workout. Though he is on the
sidelines at present, A1 Cole has
already won recognition, and Milt
Vucinich is a better than average
replacement for All - American
bound Standlee.
