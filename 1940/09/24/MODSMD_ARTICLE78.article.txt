### JERRY BRUCKER 
ANOTHER JINX
TO BE LICKED
Among the numerous jinxes that
have haunted Stanford football
teams in recent years is a first-game
bugaboo that Coach Clark Shaugh
nessy and crew will try to conquer
in Kezar Stadium this Saturday.
It was way back in the fall of '35,
with the Vowing Sophs starting their
last year, that an Indian eleven
opened its season with a win, a 35-0
pasting over San Jose State.
For the following three years
the Indians were occupied on
opening Saturdays taking lickings
from Buck Shaw's Santa Clara
Broncos. After absorbing a 22-0
shellacking in 1938, the Farm
board of strategy decided to honor
Mr. Shaw's Sugar Bowlers by
moving them, further back on the
schedule and putting the usually
inoffensive Oregon Slate Beavers
in the opening spot. Whereupon
the Beavers came through with a
12-0 win and went on to their best
season in years, losing only to
use.
Oregon State was promptly re
placed for this year's opener by
U.S.F. The Indians and the Dons
have met four times in the past,
Stanford winning each time, but
never by more than a two-touch
down margin. Last fall George
Malley's squad beat Si. Marys and
tied Santa Clara for one of the most
successful campaigns in the school's
history. Advance dope this year
marks thorn as an even stronger
team.
With this in mind, the Dons are
slated (o go into Saturday's game
as favorites. With a new coach
ing staff, however, the Farm
should adopt a new attitude.
Something like "Off with the old
jinxes, on with the new" might be
in order.
HEREWITH OUR
FIRST APOLOGY
For the first, but certainly not the
last time this year, Slants must
apologize for an injustice done. As
yet we have received no threaten
ing notices, but to forestall any
objections this column bows its
head in humility.
In the Pre-Reg issue of The
Daily, Sideline Slants tried to
make this Underwood co-operate
to form the word Alhamhra; what
came out was Alameda. Taking
it all back in advance, Johnny
Petrovich went to high school in
the former village, not the latter,
and il was the upright citizens of
Alhamhra who advocated repri-
I sals against Edwin Atherton.

Last spring a young gent named
Archibald wandered briefly into
Slants and then wandered out
again. Now, at the request of no
body. our hypothetical frbshman
friend returns.
Thursday Archibald showed up
at Stanford. He staggered through
Pre-Reg in the usual bewildered
fashion. After a bitter four-hour
struggle he succeeded in regis
tering, then went buck to Encina
and collapsed.
Around three o'clock he felt bet
ter and wandered off in the direc
tion of the practice field, where his
roommate said the Indians were
practicing.
Archibald had never seen a real
honest-to-go.sh college football team
practice, and was looking forward
to the event with what some people
would call relish. He was disap
pointed no end when a smallish, of
ficial looking person at the gate in
formed him that practice was se
cret, had been all fall, and prob
ably would be for a long time to
come.
Archibald found a knot hole in
the fence, and. after watching for
ten minutes, decided that he didn't
want to watch practice after all.
He couldn't tell one player from
another in their numberless white
shirts, and he didn't have a pro
gram anyway. There was no
tackling and no hard blocking to
speak of; the manager at the gate
told him that Coach Shaughnessy
didn't plan to scrimmage the squad
more than half a dozen times
more throughout the season.
Archibald went back to Encina.
