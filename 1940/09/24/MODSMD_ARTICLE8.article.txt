# Police Recover Stolen Articles
## Thief Sells Purloined Books at California 
### 
Gordy Davis, campus policeman,
yesterday reported the recovery of
approximately $400 of articles stolen
from campus cars during last spring's
final examination week.
"These articles, which include
everything from sliderules to over
coats, were stolen from parked cars
last spring," Davis stated. "The
Daily had ceased publication, so we
had no way of notifying the rightful
owners after recovery."
If any student lost an article in
such a way, he or she should enter
a description at the police office in
the Corporation Yard. Proper insti
tution will be made if possible. As
yet, however, none of the books
stolen have been recovered, as the
thief sold them in Berkeley.
Mr. Davis continued, "I might add
that the thief was in no way con
nected with Stanford. After being
captured he admitted his guilt and
served a term in jail. Upon release
he proceeded to burglarize several
houses at California University."
The thief is still at large, and Offi
cer Davis suggests that students be
careful about leaving valuable ar
ticles in unlocked parked cars.
