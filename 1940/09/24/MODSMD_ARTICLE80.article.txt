# Loren La Prade Joins Papooses For '40 Season
## Hefty Paly Fullback Breaks Ankle in Tilt With Indian Varsity 
### DON SELBY 
Minus the services of Bill Kruetz- |
mann, hefty fullback who haiis from
Palo Alto, Coach Harry Shipkey's
frosh gridders, approximately 42
in number, went through a snappy
workout on the practice field yes
terday. Kruetzmann is out with a
broken ankle, the result of a scrim
mage Jast Saturday between the
frosh and the varsity.
Surprise addition to tlie Papoose
eleven is Loren LaPrade, highly
publicized center from Phoenix,
Arizona, who was declared ineli
gible to play football at U.S.C. by
Edwin N. Athertpp. LaPrade has
taken over the first-string center
berth while Bill Josslyn, all-city
pivot man from San Francisco, has
been shifted to right tackle. The
.move enables Shipkey to utilize
talents of two good men at the same
time instead of having them battle
each other for a starting spot.
USE SHAU(.I|Nf:SSV flay
Using Head Coach Clark Shaugh
nessy's version of the single wing
back formation, the frosh spent the
greater part of yesterday's work
out in running plays against the
dummies. The last three-quarters
of an hour saw the first three teams
work their plays against a charging
line. The defensive outfit had no
backfield.
According to Coach Shipkey, this
year's yearlings are a little slower
in shaping up than were last fall's
freshman gridders. However, he
predicts that before long he will
have a smoothly functioning start
ing team. They will be a little
lighter than the team of a year ago.
''Our biggest trouble js in re
serve material," says Harry. "We
just lack a large number of good
reserves." As a matter of fact, Ship
key is still looking for more mate
rial. "I wish that any fellows with
any ability at all who have not yet
come out for freshman football
would sign up," he says. "We are
starting a team of new men now.
PLAY SAN MATEO J.C.
The first game for the frosh will
be against San Mateo Junior Col
lege on Saturday, October 5, in a
preliminary to the Stanford Var
sity-University of Oregon fracas.
In the meantime, Shipkey and his
assistants, Bones Hamilton, Bob
Dakan, Jens Bugge, and H. B.

"Bi-eb" Leo. will be working ihc-ii
