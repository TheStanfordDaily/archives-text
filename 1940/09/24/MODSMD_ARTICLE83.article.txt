# Wieland Pitches Angels to 2-0 Win
## 
### 
The Los Angeles Angels used the
sturdy left arm of big Bob Weiland
today to pace them into the Pacific
C.oast League's Shaughnessy playoff
finals by defeating San Diego, 2-0.
Weiland whitewashed the Padres,
allowed one scratch bingleâ€”a bloop
er past third base by Swede Jenren,
first-inning lead-off man who hit the
first ball pitched. It was Weiland's
second win of the seven-game series.
