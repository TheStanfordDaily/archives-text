DEL MONTE, Sept. 23 (UP). —
Dorothy Traung, chunky San Fran
cisco girl, fired a 78, two over par,
on the troublesome Pebble Beach
course today and apparently cinched
medalist honors in the 44th annual
women's national amateur golf
championship.
Those of the IGI entrants still to
be heard from when Dorothy posted

her score were not considered likely
to threaten the San Francisco girl's
bid for the medalist honor she won
once before in 1938.
Miss Traung's 78 led by one stroke
over two other Californians — Mr£:
Frank Russ of Oakland and Eliza
beth Hicks of Long Beach. Not a
single 80 was on the board, and
but two 81s. by Dorothy Girby ol

I Atlanta and Mrs. L. D. Cheney of
Los Angeles. After qualifying so
handsomely, Mrs. Cheney withdrew
from the tournament. She said the
strain of playing through would be
too much. She was a finalist in 1929.
Defending Champion Betty Jame
son of San Antonio collared an 84.
If Dorothy doesn't take this thing
home, there ar.e certainly enough

other Californians to fill in. Two
thirds of the qualifying field of (>t
are Irom lhit> State, 15 lrom North
ern California.
While Dorothy's 78 is a nice little
count and deserves proper applause,
the real surprise among the low
scorcrs was Mrs. Frank Russ, who
re jisters from Crystal Springs and
lives in Oakland.
The former Coast diving cham
pion as Bunny Fergus, she took up
goli because her husband was quite
i sticker himself. Now the Russ

team has a standing challenge out
to any other husband-wife pair in
California.
Unlike most of the day's field. Mrs.
Russ had little if any trouble, find
ing pars and bogies consistently.
This course, however, had almost
every other competitor scared by
stages, and on at lear.t one hole came
a blowup for all. *
Dorothy iraung lound a soaring
seven, after she had gone the first
nine in .'SG. But that was mild. Holer
Sigel of Philadelphia, judged the

longest hitter in the tournament,
also went out in 36 but took a wobbly
nine on the final hole. Peggy Gra
ham of Los Angeles needed a par on
the last hole to break 80 but also
went for a nine.
Yet even these were child's play
compared to the big league scores
turned in by Pat McPhee of Crystal
Springs and Mis. Jo Gardner of Los
Angeles. Pat came to the 18th with
a good chance to qualify. She hit
one into the ocean. She hit another
into the ocean. Ditto and ditto and

d'tto. pinal result, 13 shots on the
lStli hole and a day's total of 102.'
The fur-lined tin golf
elub trophy, however, must go to
Mrs. Gardner. At the eighth hole
she inspected the brink and by the
time she had splashed all over
Monterey Bay, losing four golf balls
in the proeess, she had a 15 on the
hole. Her total was only 98.
The Indian water buffalo is a good
match for a tiger, yet a child eon
handle it with ease.
