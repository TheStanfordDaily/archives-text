# The 						Autumn Picture
## 
### 
MOST newspaper editorials either "point with
pride" or "view with alarm." Thi \s a city
room adage that, through the years, has been
found to be generally true. In the springtime,
on warm, optimistic days, the daily output of
writers abounds in approbation for theories,
causes and projects.
Autumn guarter, too, is yet unblemished and
untried. The vast machine of campus activities
is poised, awaiting the Reg Dance tonight which
will spring it into motion. And The Daily, shin
ing under its new coat of paint, still looks with
benign eye at most any effort or idea. There
will come a time, not distant, when it will be
easier to view with alarm, but at least this once
let The Daily point with pride.
Chairman Jim Haugh and his able crew of
Pre-Registration committeemen have polished
off another freshman orientation program. To
someone who has seen three previous Pre-Reg
programs, this year's seemed notably success
ful. Many of the workers had served before;
they understood their jobs and they knew the
best methods of solving each specific problem
as it arose.
And most striking of all was the feeling of
confidence, of sure direction and well-mapped
planning that made the Pre-Reg week-end a
steady but regulated round of social and aca
demic introduction to autumn guarter. There
was none of the haste and flurry that have char
acterized some previous programs, and yet each
event in the three-day enterprise followed in
logical sequence and with smoothly engineered
timing.
The appropriate culmination of the week-end
came Sunday afternoon on Stanford Hill. When
Dr. Wilbur joined the class of '44 for its barbe
cue, he read letters written while he was a fresh
man in Encina. And as he spoke to the Stanford
men and women of today about the Farm of
yesterday, a clear image formed in each listen
er's mind—a realization that the college that
Senator Stanford had built on his Palo Alto es
tate had grown a lot in fifty years, but its essen
tial spirit had not changed.
Each freshman, walking down the hill in a
chill autumn twilight, must have felt himself in
timately a part of Stanford's future. Its next fifty
years might alter at his touch.

event in the three-day enterprise followed in
logical sequence and with smoothly engineered
timing.
The appropriate culmination of the week-end
came Sunday afternoon on Stanford Hill. When
Dr. Wilbur joined the class of '44 for its barbe
cue, he read letters written while he was a fresh
man in Encina. And as he spoke to the Stanford
men and women of today about the Farm of
yesterday, a clear image formed in each listen
er's mind—a realization that the college that
Senator Stanford had built on his Palo Alto es
tate had grown a lot in fifty years, but its essen
tial spirit had not changed.
Each freshman, walking down the hill in a
chill autumn twilight, must have felt himself in
timately a part of Stanford's future. Its next fifty
years might alter at his touch.
MOST newspaper editorials either "point with
pride" or "view with alarm." Thi \s a city
room adage that, through the years, has been
found to be generally true. In the springtime,
on warm, optimistic days, the daily output of
writers abounds in approbation for theories,
causes and projects.
Autumn guarter, too, is yet unblemished and
untried. The vast machine of campus activities
is poised, awaiting the Reg Dance tonight which
will spring it into motion. And The Daily, shin
ing under its new coat of paint, still looks with
benign eye at most any effort or idea. There
will come a time, not distant, when it will be
easier to view with alarm, but at least this once
let The Daily point with pride.
Chairman Jim Haugh and his able crew of
Pre-Registration committeemen have polished
off another freshman orientation program. To
someone who has seen three previous Pre-Reg
programs, this year's seemed notably success
ful. Many of the workers had served before;
they understood their jobs and they knew the
best methods of solving each specific problem
as it arose.
And most striking of all was the feeling of
confidence, of sure direction and well-mapped
planning that made the Pre-Reg week-end a
steady but regulated round of social and aca
demic introduction to autumn guarter. There
was none of the haste and flurry that have char
acterized some previous programs, and yet each
event in the three-day enterprise followed in
logical sequence and with smoothly engineered
timing.
