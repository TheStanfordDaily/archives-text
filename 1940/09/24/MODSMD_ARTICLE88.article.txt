AGE-OLD is the controversy regarding the
relative intelligence, initiative, and morality
of succeeding geenrations. It has been the same
in every era of history, and probably of pre
history, the constant verbal tirade of one self
satisfied, declining generation against a young
er, impatient generation.
Our grandfathers thought that the era of our
fathers was a degradation of their own. They
pointed to the immorality of the "roaring 'twen
ties with its speakeasies, flappers, imperialistic
expansion. And in turn our great-grandfathers
pointed disparagingly to the life of our grand
fathers, decrying the automobile, shortening
skirts, the beginnings of corporate monopolies.
Through the years that we call history, we can
see this trend. It is too omnipresent to be called
a mere tendency.
But a mortal man, called both "god" and "dev
il," "madman'' and "genius," has stopped in
headlong historical flight this ancient contro
versy.
In fact, this mortal who at present is person
ally attempting to rewrite political and economic
history, has completely reversed the age-old
fight between father and son. Today's son be
lieves that this degeneration has been passed
down to him.
Did not our preceding era, faced with the de
cision of halting alleged militaristic expansion,
successfully fight for the preservation of what
it called the "basic principles of individual free
rlom"? And then didn't it. on re and for all. m.iko

the world a sale breeding place for progressive
initiative?
The answer, of course, as reflected in the mir
ror of contemporary events, is that it did neither.
For today the younger generation faces prac
tically the same problems its fathers did twenty
five years ago. It must decide which cause is
just, whether personal or commercial interests
are involved, and Americans must decide once
more how they are affected by the European
issues.
So the trend of history is broken—and now it
is the younger generation, the youth of the years
of 1930 to 1945, which looks askance.
And knows in the failure of its fathers to solve
their own problems, that we cannot be con
demned, much less convicted, of being a degen
eration of a preceding era.
For we must make their decisions over again.
We weren't given the opportunity to settle new
issues founded on the progress of humanity and
science.—G. M.
