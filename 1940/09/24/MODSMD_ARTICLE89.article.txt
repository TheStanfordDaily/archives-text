# BULL SESSION
## AND THE DAMES CAME 
### BUD AMES 
rpiJIS actually happened. A certain campus politician
whose first name is Grayson and who is a member
of the Phi Psi house spotted a lonely looking female
at last Saturday's freshman jolly-up. He stepped up,
smiled his best I's-a-likely-candidate smile and asked
her did she care to waltz. Her answer shot back.
"No tanks, I'm a freak."
There it was, a fat vote flowing down the political
gutter, so the politician attempted a cover-up. It
didn't work. The female still insisted she was a
freak.

JJNDOUBTEDLY, unquestionably, she is the excep
tion that proves the rule. The freshmen women
arc beautiful. They all have teeth, real hair, and in
rapid passing we might also bestow our blessings on
Mr. Nylnn. He really knew his business. The fresh
men women arc gorgeous. Reports have it that they
comprise the most beautiful incoming class in the
past eight years. And if you are thinking of wasting
stamps on remarks about our being here eight years
—forget it. No—and don't try that, other one either.
Quotes always come in handy, so here follow a
couple made on the subject.
Barbara Swcetland, Roble sponsor,-reports, "There
are no outstanding queens in this class like last year,
but then there are no lemons." My, my, that would
imply that there were some lemons in last year's
female crop. And from the lacquered lips of a fresh
man woman, the lips from which all blessings flow,
come these poignant, trenchant words. "I've had a
good gander at the freshman men, and, boy, they're
loaded with goons. 1 wish they'd put their teeth and
their eyes back in. They look like a bunch of gophers."

the women have turned the trick. It
may have been the dust bowl migration, it may
have been the present administration, but for some
reason, a bumper female crop has descended on the
pulchritudinously parched Farm. Which, of course, is
going to upset that two and a half men to every
woman ratio which you have heard so much about.
Apparently the freshmen men constitute the half of
that two and a half. May we suggest that two of
thern, a top and a bottom half, get together and then
rush over to Roble for a date.
And by the way of advice to the freshmen men, let
us suggest that they spend their every spare moment
pounding on Roble's solid oak doors if they expect 1o
create any sort of an impression. Just because she
smiled at you at the jolly-up doesn't mean she knows
you from another half, even a top half. Remember that
she was working just as hard as you, and she probably
promised dates to four score and twenty more.
The number to call is 5171,
If a man answers, it's a top half who got there
first.
