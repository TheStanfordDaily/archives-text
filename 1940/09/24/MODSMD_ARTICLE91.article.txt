# LET'S USE THE BOWL

EDITOR, SIR:
Stanford's Frost Amphitheater is one of the most
beautiful open nil - bowls of its type on any college
campus.
This amphitheater takes the time of two men every
day of the year to keep it in shape.
What worries me, however, is the question, "Why
doesn t Stanford make more use of this garden spot
of Ihe campus?" I believe it is safe to say that 75 pel
cent of those students who graduated in the amphi
theater last June had never before been inside this
high spot of Stanford secnic charm.
And they had been students at the University for
four years.
The general public has had many less opportunities
to view this spot than have the students. It is with
this in mind that I submit this suggestion through the
Campus Opinion column of The Daily:
"Why does not Stanford sponsor one or more spring
symphony concerts, a dramatic ofTering, or any other
similar form of entertainment during spring quarter
to be attended by students and the public alike?"
Such a program would attract a sizeable audience,
if only to see the Frost Amphitheater.
With the fine facilities of the drama department as
well as the rich supply of talent, it seems that some
sort of production could be arranged for such a per
fectly situated open air stage.
At the present time only graduation ceremonies
and a Mothers Club pageant are presented in the
Amphitheater. In more ways than one this constitutes
a sheer waste of a valuable asset to the Farm. During
the summer quarter vesper services arc occasionally
held in the Bowl but. as far as the regular student
of the University knows, that particular section of the
campus is almost a mystery.
There are many other suggestions possible for uses
to which this natural theater may be put, and I sin
cerely hope that in the near future Stanford students
will not have to wait until graduation to see one of
the University's famous landmarks.
