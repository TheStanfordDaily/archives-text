# Fights, Lavish Costumes Featured In 'Sea Hawk'
## 
### 
"TIIE SKA lIAWK." now playing at the Stanford 1 heater.
In costume there is iust one word to describe Errol Flynn. All together
now:
"Swashbuckling!"
If you like sword fights up and down stairs, galleon battles at sea, men

boarding ships with cutlasses in
their teeth, and a hero who drinks
to Good Queen Bc.ss in King Phil
ip's best silver plate, you'll like
"The Sea Hawk." It's good enter
tainment of the "gadzooks good sir"
variety, but one is inclined to won
der if Flynn isn't whyt England
needs right now.
CAPTAIN' FLYNN
As the gallant captain of a priva
teer, he harries Spanish shipping,
gels caught, spends a brief time as
a galley slave, escapes, and comes
roaring back to England with The
Papers, thereby indirectly defeating
the Armada and making a hero out
of Sir Francis Drake.
Incidentally he finds Bernda Mar
shall on one of the Spanish ships and
after a suitable interval, becomes
engaged to her. Of course, she
thinks he's nothing but a low-grade
pirate at first, but she sees his true
worth in practically no time, and
spends the rest of the picture look
ing lovesick. She docs this very
well.
BUT IT'S OOOD
But in case you think I'm carp
ing, please understand that I think
that "The Sea Hawk" is slam-bang
fun. You can call the turn on prac
tically every incident. Who cares?
The music is good, the ships are
beautiful, the sword-play is nerve
wracking, and the costumes are
lavish.
Flora Robson, the great English
stage actress, is a magnificent Queen
Elizabeth, Henry Daniell and Claude
Rains ore properly sinister, and Una
O'Connor, late of the Abbey The
ater, plays a comic maid with care
less ease.â€”Nowell
