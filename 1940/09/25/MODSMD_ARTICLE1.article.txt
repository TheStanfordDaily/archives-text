### BOB LOW 
r PUREE months ago France and
Britain were aliles fighting a
common war against Germany. Yes
terday, the two former allies were I
battling each other in dead earnest
over possession of a city on the wesl
coast of Africa of which most per
sons in the civilized world had |
never heard before the present in
cident. The British evidently aren't I
taking any chances on the port's fall
ing into German hands. There must
be much at stake when the British
are willing to risk an open war with
France while they are so sorely
pressed to defend themselves at
home.
According to the British com
munique, General De Gaulle, Free
French leader who has operated
from London, attempted to land
from a warship of the Free French
forces. Units of the British fleets
were present only as a precaution
against any "German inspired" re
sistance. Whether or not it was Ger
man inspired, resistance was soon
evidenced and an open battle for
possession of the city developed.
The British admit that an initial
landing party was forced to with
draw after suffering some casualties.
The French version, coining from
Vichy, says that six attempts to
land troops from British warships
have been beaten back. The
French general defending Dakar
is credited with saying that he will
hold out to the end. From both
reports, it was clear that furious
lighting which includes bombard
ment of the city by the British is
in progress.

Gibraltar was subjected to heavy
aerial bombardment yesterday, ac
cording to reports from both Gibral
tar and from a point near the fort
ress in Spanish territory. The
bombing was by planes clearly
identified as French. So it appears
that the French were retaliating for
Britain's bombardment of Dakar.
Observers from neutral Spain indi
cated that the bombing was the most
drastic that had yet come to the
British stronghold.

attention shifted to this
new phase of the war, a bulle
tin from Helsinki indicated that
things were as yet anything but
stable in the Baltic countries. Ger
man troops landed at a Finnish port
on the Gulf of Bothnia under terms
of a new Finnish-German agree
mnet. It was believed that Finland
had submitted to a German ultima
tum for a route through Finland to
northern Norway. A Finnish com
munique said the action involved
"transport of German troops on
leave and the transit of German sup
plies." Little news has come from
Finland or Sweden since German
conquest of Norway, and it seems
probable that the Germans now
dominate not only Norway but also
Sweden and Finland to a great de
gree. Ore deposits in northern Nor
way are vital to German armament
and their transit is being assured.

A DDITIONAL news from the Far
East concerning the docking of
an American battleship in Shanghai
failed to come through yesterday;
but from Tokyo came an item that
indicated that the Japanese were
watching this development closely.
One rumor in the Japanese capital
was that a provisional Japanese-
German defense pact of far-reaching
consequence had already been nego
tiated. The mere inclusion of such
a rumor in a press dispatch is suffi
cient indication that tension is
growing over the new war in Indo-
China. The Japanese several weeks
ago would not have considered a
pact with Germany. Secretary of
State Hull's denunciation of the
Japanese invasion of the French
colony may have altered Japan's po
sition considerably.
