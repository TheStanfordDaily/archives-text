After running officialdom's gaunt
let and sparkling before a collection
of photographer's flash bulbs, no
new experience for Miss Gestring,
she fled from the Ad building for
Roble's quieter halls, where she
later said:
"I'm tickled pink to be here, and I
love Stanford. Needless to say, I
was very happy to be the first one
to register."
Miss Gestring is women's national
diving champion on the three-foot

tower, and is the present Olympic
champ, having captured her title in
