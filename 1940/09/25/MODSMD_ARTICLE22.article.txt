# Registration Figures Drop Below 1939 High; 4180 Enter Stanford
## 'Three-to-One Ratio' Decrease Is Reported 
### 
It may be the lure of the army, or
it may be the tuition increase, but
whether or not the cause is known,
Stanford's first day registration fig
ures dropped 27 persons below last
year's all-time high of 4,207, with
4,180 Stanfordites "making checks
payable" during the first two days of
registration.
Of these 2,873 were men and 1,307
were women, as against, last, year's
figures of 2.928 men and 1,277 wom
en, a substantial decrease of 55 mem
bers of the Farm's dominating sex.
These figures were released yes
terday afternoon at the completion
of two "Ad P3uilding madhouse"
days, by Dr. J. P. Mitchell, Univer
sity registrar.
Though this decline is slight, the
change in the comparative figures
for men and women takes another
healthy swipe at the old traditional
"three-to-one" ratio.
Last year it was 2.201 men to one
woman, but the new change now cuts
each Stanford women down to 2.121
men.
Of course, these figures arc merely
tentative since untimely and non
penny-pinching students may regis
ter in the University until Oct. 15.
However, figures from the Regis
trar's office indicate that no increase
in enrollment is made after the first
week following official registration,
at which time total figures will bo
released.
