—The Japanese Canton army late
Tuesday resumed heavy attacks
across the Kwangsi frontier on
French and Indo-Chinese forces
which resisted stoutly from foftified
positions.
In the first few hours of the at
tacks 200 Japanese prisoners were
taken.
French authorities indicated the
agreement signed here Sunday with
the Japanese was cancelled because
k was unworkable. The agreement
provided for Japanese occupation of
three airdromes by a limited num
ber of Japanese troops (said in
France to be 6,000). It did not sanc
tion entry of the powerful Canton
army into Indo-China.
A Japanese invasion fleet com
prising eight troop transports, a
cruiser and three destroyers re
ported en route to Haiphong, the
country's principal port. The com
mander reportedly had been asked,
however, by Maj-Gen. Issaku Nishi
hara to defer an attempt to land by
force at Haiphong.
The French, reported to have re
captured Dong Dang on the frontier,
which they were forced to abandon
to superior forces early Monday,
were reported to be fighting deter
minedly there and at Langson, im
portant railroad town 82 rtiles
northeast of here. French shelling
was said to be taking heavy toll of
advancing Japanese.
It is of vital importance the French
forces hold Langson. From that
point flat plains lead inland to the
capital and the heart of the colony—
ideal terrain for Japanese tanks and
motorized columns.
Lganoi had its third air alarm
Tuesday afternoon. Posters were
plastered all over the city urging ev
eryone without urgent business in
the capital to leave. Schools were
closed.
Twelve Japanese bombers flew
over Haiphony early Tuesday, but
dropped no bombs. French ground
batteries withheld fire.
The Japanese notified the French
they would launch a major attack on
the coastal region at dawn, which
would include the bombing of Hai
phong, port of Hanoi.
Japanese bombers attacked Lang
son repeatedly, which also was under
artillery fire. At least two Japanese
planes were reported shot down in
the Langson area.

—The Japanese Canton army late
Tuesday resumed heavy attacks
across the Kwangsi frontier on
French and Indo-Chinese forces
which resisted stoutly from foftified
positions.
In the first few hours of the at
tacks 200 Japanese prisoners were
taken.
French authorities indicated the
agreement signed here Sunday with
the Japanese was cancelled because
k was unworkable. The agreement
provided for Japanese occupation of
three airdromes by a limited num
ber of Japanese troops (said in
France to be 6,000). It did not sanc
tion entry of the powerful Canton
army into Indo-China.
A Japanese invasion fleet com
prising eight troop transports, a
cruiser and three destroyers re
ported en route to Haiphong, the
country's principal port. The com
mander reportedly had been asked,
however, by Maj-Gen. Issaku Nishi
hara to defer an attempt to land by
force at Haiphong.
