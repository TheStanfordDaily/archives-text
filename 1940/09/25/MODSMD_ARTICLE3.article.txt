### 
GIBRALTAR, Wed., Sept. 25 (UP).
â€”A fleet of 20 or more "French
type" planes, in apparent reprisal
or the British naval bombardment
>f Dakar, subjected this British
"ortress to a heavy bombing attack
/esterday causing dead and wound
id, an official communique said early
today.
The raiders, sweeping in upon the
'rock" in relays, hurled approxi
mately 100 explosives upon it in a
two and one-half hour attack far
more violent than any of the air at-
Lacks staged previously by the
Italian air force.
DAMAGE GREAT
Buildings were damaged, roads
were ripped up and three small
fires were started, although they
quickly were brought under con
trol, the communique said.
British warships in Gibraltar har
bor and shore batteries threw up a
mighty wall of fire against the raid
ers as they dodged in and out of
clouds at 20,000 feet.
The British communique said:
"Some 20 or more aircraft of
French types taking advantage of
low-patched levant clouds bombed
Gibraltar from a height of 20,000
feet. The attackers were engaged by
the anti-aircraft defenses of ships
and on shore while the bombing
continued intermittently for two and
one-half hours.
BOMBING HEAVY
"Approximately 100 bombs were
dropped and many fell into the sea.
Damage was done to buildings and
roads. Three small fires soon were
under control.
"The casualties were four killed
and 12 wounded. Damage caused to
the enemy is uncertain but it is be
lieved that at least one plane was
shot down."
(Dispatches from La Linea across
the Gibraltar-Spanish frontier said
great fires were started in many
parts of Gibraltar, evacuated of
civilians several weeks ago, and that
several British warships and mer
chant ships were reported hit by
bombs.)
