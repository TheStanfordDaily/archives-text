## 
### BOB McNEIL 
(Editor's note: The following
interview with Wendell Willkie,
Republican candidate for Presi
dent, was obtained, on his own
initiative, by Boh McNeil. Stan
ford junior, during Mr. Willkie's
recent visit to San Francisco.)

By BOB McNEIL

Two burly policemen greeted me
at the hotel room door.
"I want to see Willkie," I said.
"Yeah?"
"I'm from Stanford University.
Want to interview him."
"You'll have to see Lem Jones in
508. Up the staii's, there." The man
pointed his cigar.
The door to 508 was open so I
walked in. A young woman was
working at a desk. She looked up
with a pleasant "Can I help you?"
"I'd like to see Lem Jones about
an interview with Mr. Willkie."
SAN FRANCISCO SPEECH
"Well, I don't know. It's pretty
late now. He speaks in about 45
minutes." She gave me another
glance. "I'll see what I can do."
She picked up the phone, only to
drop it a minute later. "Busy," she
said. "Look, I can't promise you
anything, but if you want to wait
»
"I'll wait." She busied herself
with some papers. Then, "How did
you get into politics?" I asked.
"You mean this secretarial job?
I used to work on a paper. That's
how I got to be Lem Jones's secre
tary." She went on. "You see, Mr.
Willkie was always giving speeches
spontaneously. It got so that when
a big shot from Washington would
drop in on him, he'd give a press
story, only to follow it a few min
utes later with another story when
someone from New York dropped
in to see him. The result would be
that only half the reporters would
get the second story. The situation
became so bad that the newsmen
got together and voted Lem Jones in
to take all the news."
INTERVIEW GRANTED
She glanced at her watch. "Guess
the best thing is to go down and sec
him. Come on." I followed her down
the hall. "Wait here," she said,
pushing past the two policemen.
Minutes later I heard a loud mas
culine voice.

"You and college kids, you al
ways "
The door opened, and a man
young enough to be a college under
graduate stood facing me.
''Follow me," he motioned. I fol
lowed him into a large room.
Willkie, dressed in a black double
breasted suit, was looking over the
manuscript of his speech. He stood
with his shoulders slightly stooped,
as though trying to give all his
concentration to the papers in his
hand. With one hand in his pocket
and his coat open, he looked like a
small-town business man.
PERSONABLE FIGURE
As I entered, he looked up and
smiled—it was a friendly and sin
cere smile carrying with it the full
force of his personality, but he
looked tired.
"What do you want to know?" he
asked.
I nervously stuttered out the first
question.
"Are you tired now, Mr. Willkie,
with the trip but half through?"
"Yes, but I'm afraid I'm only well
started."
"Do you feel that the enthusiasm
of the people for you has changed
any as you moved across the coun
try?"
"Well, it has been about the same
throughout the country, but I could
answer the question better a little
later in the tour."
Do you think that your trip
west will, uh, uh, garner any more
Republicans?"
He laughed heartily, and, folding
his manuscript into his pocket,
walked over and picked up his hat.
SILENT ON F.D.R.
"I hope so. I believe that reveal
ing the truth about the administra
tion will help the Republican party
immensely, and you'll hear more
about that when I give my spccch
tonight."
Just then Mr. Jones interrupted,
"Are you ready, Mr. Willkie?"
He nodded and I followed him
out the door into a crowded ele
vator.
"Just one more question, Mr.
Willkie. What do you think about
Roosevelt's silence?"
Before he could answer, the ele
vator opened; he stepped out the
side entrance to be greeted by loud
cheers from a crowd yelling, "We
want Willkie!"
