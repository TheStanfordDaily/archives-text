EUGENE, Ore., Sept. 24 (UP). â€”
Another "Jackrabbit" Jay Graybeal,
the light halfback wonder of the
1939 University of Oregon football
squad, may be in the making in Ken
Oliphant, 160-pound halfback from
San Jose. Oliphant, who has lots of
shifty speed, was receiving atten
tion today from Coach Oliver in
preparation for the opener Friday
night with the San Diego Marines.
The Oregon mentor again scheduled
aerial practice today.
