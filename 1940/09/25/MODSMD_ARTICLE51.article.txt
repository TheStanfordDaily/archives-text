## 
### 
BERKELEY, Sept. 24 (UP).â€”Jim
Jurkovich, brilliant sophomore right
halfback of Fresno, around whom
Coach Stub Allison had built the
California Bears' football eleven,
was injured seriously in scrimmage
today.
Jurkovich, described as the best
sophomore football prospect in the
nation, complained of dizziness and
collapsed in the squad's dressing
rooms after leaving the field.
He was removed to Powell Hospi
tal on the University of California
campus. Dr. William Donald said he
had a severe concussion and will be
out of the line-up indefinitely.

For years past the Stanford Steam
Roller has played an important part
in the Farm football picture.
before the days of the Vowing
Sophs the Little Indian has ridden
to victory on his two-ton mount.
Through good years and bad the
puffing gravel-flattener has symbol
ized the Stanford gridiron machine
and spirit.
Today, with Coach Ciark Shaugh
nessy drilling his gridders in a new
style of football, a style that places
emphasis on blinding speed and in
tricate. deceptive play, the time has
come for the Little Indian to pension
the steed that has carried him
through so many seasons.
And so it is that this familiar ma
chine makes its last trip across the
sports pages of The Daily. We'll
miss it, and hope that some day it
may be resurrected, but for the
present we'll just say "So long."
