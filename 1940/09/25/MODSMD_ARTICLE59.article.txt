# Papooses Flash Strong Passing Attack in Drill
## 
### 
If yesterday's workout is any cri
terion, Stanford's 1940 irosh gridders
are going to flash a snappy passing
attack. Coach Harry Shipkey had
his lads working more than a little
hit on some pass plays from the sin
gle wingback formation the Papoose
squad is running from this season.
The principal men on the flinging
end of the aerials were Bob Mitchell,
Jim Troup, Frank Forbes, and Bob
Koch, all halrb acks. In the single
wing attacking formation, the half
backs are either in the tailback spot
or at a wingback, depending on
which way the team shifts. Mitchell,
left half, and Troup, right half, alter
nated at throwing and receiving from
the tailback and wingback spots on
the first outfit, while Forbes and
Koch took the corresponding posi
tions on the second eleven.
ENDS PROMISING
Jim El lies and Bill Madden, ends
on the first team, and Jim Norse and
Bill Brubnker, ends on the seconds,
got a workout on the receiving end
ol the pass play. Ellis especially
.showed promise. Larry Wolf, husky
end from Seattle, has been shifted
from end to guard, where Shipkey
believes his weight will be an ad
vantage.
The Papoose squad has a line
which, it it lives up to advance pub
licity, should prove to be very effec
tive. In Jean LaMoure the frosh
have a tackle whom Fresnans claim
is every bit as good a ballplayer as
Jim Jurkovich, highly publicized
Cal footballer from Fresno.
.lOSSLYN SHIFTED
Then too, there is Bill Josslyn
from Lowell High School, who has
been San Francisco's outstanding
prep pivot man for the past two
years. Josslyn has been moved to
l ight tackle to make room for Loren
LaPrade, a Phoenix, Arizona, boy
who made a last-minute decision to
attend Stanford instead of the Uni
versity of Southern California.
LaPrade might have been shifted
instead of Josslyn had it not been
that the former is a little taller. The
height element is important where
centers are concerned since the pivot
man defends against passes from his
line-backing position.
The irosh have eight more prac
tice sessions on tap, including today's
workout, before their first game of
the season against San Mateo J. C.
on Saturday, October 5.
