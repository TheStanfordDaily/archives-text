### 
NEW YORK, Sept. 24 (UP).â€”
Lou Silica, dark - haired little
Brooklyn Italian, recaptured the
world bantamweight championship
tonight by winning a 15-round de
cision over Georgie Pace, Cleveland
negro, before 4,183 persons at the
Bronx Coliseum.
Salica, who held the 118-pound
crown in 1935. won this return match
with Pace tonight by virtue of his
superior stamina. They had fought
to a 15-round draw at Toronto in
March but tonight the Brooklyn
lad's stronger finish gave him the
title.
