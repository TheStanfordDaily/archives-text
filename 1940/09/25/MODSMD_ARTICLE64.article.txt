# Cards May Launch Air Battle For Standlee-Fisk Grid Duel
## 
### 
Indications that Stanford's football debut for 11)40 against U.S.F. next
Saturday may develop into an air battle comparable only to the present
situation in Europe cropped up on the Card's practice field yesterday.
That Coach Clark Shaughnessy will have bis right halfback Frankie
Albert and even his fullback Norm Standlce pitching plenty of passes has

been well established by the
of Stanford's new attack. And yes
terday the Indian coaching stafl
showed that they expected plenty of
passing by the Dons by sending their
backfields through an intensive pass
I defense drill.
A potential first-string quartet
composed of Frank Albert at quar
terback, Norm Standlee at full, and
Pete Kmetovic and a newcomer,
Eric Armstrong at the halves went
through their paces against a series
of Don pass plays. The second
string outfit consisted of Ray Ham
mett at quarter, Milt Vucinich at
full, and John Casey and erstwhile
first-stringer Hugh Gallarneau at the
halfback positions. Whether the
promotion of Armstrong to first
string is permanent or just a pre
cautionary measure prompted by
Gallarneau's injured knee is hard to
tell.
GRIDDERS RECOVER
More of Shaughnessy's long list
of injured and absent gridders fil
tered back to the practice yesterday.
Frank Albert, Doug Stahle, and A!
Cole were back in harness.
Saturday the Cards face one of
the toughest opening assignments any
team could draw from the ranks of
the Coast's independents. Coach
George Malley will field almost the
identical team which turned back
the Cards' assistant coach, Marchie
Schwartz's, Creighton outfit 26-13
last year.
Marked as a scrappy team, the
Dons have retained last year's fire
and have plenty of experience to
boot. Bill Telesmanic, a towering
6-3 end. may well turn into the
best pass receiver on the Coast.
There's plenty of talent in the line—
I Russ Kynoo at the other end. Fred
; Haley and Bob Keith at the tackles,
Joe Van der Linden, and Bob Smith
at center.
U.S.F. BOASTS VETERANS
The backfield is full of veterans.
Dependable Walt Pudoff at quarter
j back, fleet negro Mel Reid at one
| half, versatile Marv Mosconi at the
i other half, and Cliff Fisk, a slam
i banging ball carrier whom Malley
j quite loyally calls a better fullback
J than Standlee.
The Dons are particularly abun-
I dnnt in halfbacks, having Sammy
Johnstone, Pete Visentin, Pete
j Franceschi, and Vic Ramus to fill in
for the first stringers, as well as a
! half a dozen dependable replace
ments for the linemen.
They seem to have all the require
| ments of a good ball club—experi
ence, weight, and speed. Those
Dons are going to be a tough hurdle
for the 1940 gridders to hop and
success would put the Indians well
I on their way to a good season.

Saturday the Cards face one of
the toughest opening assignments any
team could draw from the ranks of
the Coast's independents. Coach
George Malley will field almost the
identical team which turned back
the Cards' assistant coach, Marchie
Schwartz's, Creighton outfit 26-13
last year.
Marked as a scrappy team, the
Dons have retained last year's fire
and have plenty of experience to
boot. Bill Telesmanic, a towering
6-3 end. may well turn into the
best pass receiver on the Coast.
There's plenty of talent in the line—
I Russ Kynoo at the other end. Fred
; Haley and Bob Keith at the tackles,
Joe Van der Linden, and Bob Smith
at center.
U.S.F. BOASTS VETERANS
The backfield is full of veterans.
Dependable Walt Pudoff at quarter
j back, fleet negro Mel Reid at one
| half, versatile Marv Mosconi at the
i other half, and Cliff Fisk, a slam
i banging ball carrier whom Malley
j quite loyally calls a better fullback
J than Standlee.
The Dons are particularly abun-
I dnnt in halfbacks, having Sammy
Johnstone, Pete Visentin, Pete
j Franceschi, and Vic Ramus to fill in
for the first stringers, as well as a
! half a dozen dependable replace
ments for the linemen.
They seem to have all the require
| ments of a good ball club—experi
ence, weight, and speed. Those
Dons are going to be a tough hurdle
for the 1940 gridders to hop and
success would put the Indians well
I on their way to a good season.
Indications that Stanford's football debut for 11)40 against U.S.F. next
Saturday may develop into an air battle comparable only to the present
situation in Europe cropped up on the Card's practice field yesterday.
That Coach Clark Shaughnessy will have bis right halfback Frankie
Albert and even his fullback Norm Standlce pitching plenty of passes has

been well established by the
of Stanford's new attack. And yes
terday the Indian coaching stafl
showed that they expected plenty of
passing by the Dons by sending their
backfields through an intensive pass
I defense drill.
A potential first-string quartet
composed of Frank Albert at quar
terback, Norm Standlee at full, and
Pete Kmetovic and a newcomer,
Eric Armstrong at the halves went
through their paces against a series
of Don pass plays. The second
string outfit consisted of Ray Ham
mett at quarter, Milt Vucinich at
full, and John Casey and erstwhile
first-stringer Hugh Gallarneau at the
halfback positions. Whether the
promotion of Armstrong to first
string is permanent or just a pre
cautionary measure prompted by
Gallarneau's injured knee is hard to
tell.
GRIDDERS RECOVER
More of Shaughnessy's long list
of injured and absent gridders fil
tered back to the practice yesterday.
