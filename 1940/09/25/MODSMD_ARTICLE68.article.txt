### JERRY BRUCKER 
LUCKY LOL'IE PREPARES
FOR COMING SEASON
Lucky Louie, the great Canadian
middle man and self-styled football [
forecaster, entered the sports office |
through the side window yesterday {
afternoon and talked us into agree- j
ing to run his "Peerless Predictions
and Prognostications" for the coming
season.
The Louie looked about the same
as ever except for a 20-degree angle
to his nose administered late last
fall by a disillusioned fan who bet
on Louie's selections instead of
against them.
After extensive research, Louie
lias discovered the mistake in his
ratings system that caused liis un
successful campaign last year. The
original system, as near as I could
interpret it, ran something like
| this:
To the weight of the second string
fullback two years ago Christmas [
add the average length of punts in j
the preceding game. Stir thoroughly
and mix in the coach's favorite
breakfast food. From this sum sub
tract the square root of the age of
the left guard's wife and the size, j
i plus one, of the press agent's shoes, j
Hereafter Louie will multiply this '
I total by the number of left-handed
Italians in the student body.

WITII GEORGE MALLEY
George Malley, U.S.F. head grid
| mentor, is usually a very optimistic
J man, as football coaches go. Not so
! very long ago he even went so far
as to say that Cliff Fisk was a better
| fullback than any other on the coast,
including Norm Standlee.
This, we must admit, is a very
| large and indigestible mouthful,
j Playing on last year's ill-fated Big
j Red Machine, Standlee was a* really
j great ball player, and if he can es
cape injury he should prove even
j better. Fisk, according to his press
| notices, is a fine fullback, but he'll
j have a hard time proving himself
j better than "The Chief."
i Yesterday Mr. Malley was quoted
[ as saying that the even-steven odds
| that have been established on Sat
| urday's Indian-Don contest are
j wrong, that Stanford should be fa
vored. Stanford may have the best
j football team, and will probably
i prove so in Kezar Stadium, but on

the basis of pre-season dope no rea
son can be found for making the
Shaughnessymen favorites.
The reason quoted was that in the
! abbreviated four-game series be
| tween the schools, which ended in
: 1934, Stanford made a clean sweep.
Coach Malley, evidently trying des
perately to combat overconfidence,
seems to have forgotten that those
games were all very close, and that
the University of San Francisco then
was not nearly as well established in
gridiron circles as they have become
recently.
With an experienced team that tied
Santa Clara last year, Coach Malley
doesn't want to be favored over a
team with a new coach and new
system, a team that won only a
single game in the '39 campaign.
Honest, Mr., there ain't no Santa
Ciaus.
