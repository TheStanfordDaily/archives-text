PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT, writing Paul V. Mc-
Nutt, urged that the young people of America
be advised that "it is their patriotic duty to con
tinue the normal course of their education, un
less and until they are called, so that they will
be well prepared for greatest usefulness to their
country."
Apparently 2,873 men took the President's ad
vice at Stanford, for that many yesterday came
back for the University's fiftieth registration day.
The total enrollment dropped only 27 persons
behind that of last year's record. The signifi
cance of this fact lies in its relation to college
enrollment throughout the nation. Stanford, un
like many schools, has retained its position.
And, if the University's administrators had some
uneasy hours wondering what kind of a tobog
gan skid registration figures would hit, they can
now relax in the assurance that the Farm's popu
lation, quantitatively, will be about the same
for another year.
The fact, however, that the ratio between men
and v/omen students has shifted may be of more
importance. Beside the obvious truth that it will
give frustrated Farm men eight-tenths of a per
cent more of a chance at bucking ' the old aver
age," the decrease in men and increase in
women is part of a broader tendency that has
spiung from an unsettled national scene.
No matter how loudly the President may pro
claim the need for college men to serve their
country by returning to university classrooms to
acquire further skill and understanding, the lure
of lucrative spots in essential war industries and
the fear of being caught unprepared have driven
a certain number of college men and potential
college men away from laboratory and lecture
room.
This is no evidence, really, of patriotism nor
does it indicate an astounding lack of patriotism
and a love of economic gain. It is simply a fact
—there is a tendency, very slight at Stanford
but greater at other colleges, for men to forsake
academic life.
This surface sign of turmoil among the small
two and a half per cent slice of the population
that represents the college student is, quite natu
rally, a symbol of larger distress, of greater fer
ment in the national arena. Deep-felt and un
decided issues face the American people. These
issues center about the question of defense and
the means by which the United States may pre
pare itself to live in a world revolution.
And a presidential campaign drawn on these
issues offers a unique opportunity to demon
strate American democracy in action. It can
not but comprise the most effective affirmation
of an American system, a way of life that will
solve problems of universal concern in such a
way that each faction may preserve its guaran
tees of liberty and right.
V/hen, as in this year, presidential campaigns
have blossomed into national debates, political
mud-tossing merits not even an amused smile.
The larger question at stake dwarfs personalities
and high-lights ideas and methods. Today
America, including those of us who have re
turned to college, must decide whether it is pos
sible to create a massive defense program on a
foundation of social and economic progress.
And, more important, we must decide whether,
in building the machinery of defense, we must
sacrifice the structure and spirit of democracy.

now relax in the assurance that the Farm's popu
lation, quantitatively, will be about the same
for another year.
The fact, however, that the ratio between men
and v/omen students has shifted may be of more
importance. Beside the obvious truth that it will
give frustrated Farm men eight-tenths of a per
cent more of a chance at bucking ' the old aver
age," the decrease in men and increase in
women is part of a broader tendency that has
spiung from an unsettled national scene.
No matter how loudly the President may pro
claim the need for college men to serve their
country by returning to university classrooms to
acquire further skill and understanding, the lure
of lucrative spots in essential war industries and
the fear of being caught unprepared have driven
a certain number of college men and potential
college men away from laboratory and lecture
room.
This is no evidence, really, of patriotism nor
does it indicate an astounding lack of patriotism
and a love of economic gain. It is simply a fact
—there is a tendency, very slight at Stanford
but greater at other colleges, for men to forsake
academic life.
This surface sign of turmoil among the small
two and a half per cent slice of the population
that represents the college student is, quite natu
rally, a symbol of larger distress, of greater fer
ment in the national arena. Deep-felt and un
decided issues face the American people. These
issues center about the question of defense and
the means by which the United States may pre
pare itself to live in a world revolution.
And a presidential campaign drawn on these
issues offers a unique opportunity to demon
strate American democracy in action. It can
not but comprise the most effective affirmation
of an American system, a way of life that will
solve problems of universal concern in such a
way that each faction may preserve its guaran
tees of liberty and right.
V/hen, as in this year, presidential campaigns
have blossomed into national debates, political
mud-tossing merits not even an amused smile.
The larger question at stake dwarfs personalities
and high-lights ideas and methods. Today
America, including those of us who have re
turned to college, must decide whether it is pos
sible to create a massive defense program on a
foundation of social and economic progress.
And, more important, we must decide whether,
in building the machinery of defense, we must
sacrifice the structure and spirit of democracy.
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT, writing Paul V. Mc-
Nutt, urged that the young people of America
be advised that "it is their patriotic duty to con
tinue the normal course of their education, un
less and until they are called, so that they will
be well prepared for greatest usefulness to their
country."
Apparently 2,873 men took the President's ad
vice at Stanford, for that many yesterday came
back for the University's fiftieth registration day.
The total enrollment dropped only 27 persons
behind that of last year's record. The signifi
cance of this fact lies in its relation to college
enrollment throughout the nation. Stanford, un
like many schools, has retained its position.
And, if the University's administrators had some
uneasy hours wondering what kind of a tobog
gan skid registration figures would hit, they can
now relax in the assurance that the Farm's popu
lation, quantitatively, will be about the same
for another year.
