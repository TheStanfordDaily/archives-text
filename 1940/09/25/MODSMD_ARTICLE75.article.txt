# Sempervirens ... Ever-living

WHEN the relics of a vast batch of com
pleted registration booklets were swept
from the floor of Administration Building Mon
day evening, 1,227 freshmen and transfers had
completed the first step in the process of Stan
fordization.
And with the relegation of the stub-crammed
booklets to the ashcans went the final ties with
scholastic institutions once attended. The Car
dinal die was cast upon 401 fledgling Farm
women and 826 brand new Stanford men.
To them the campus offers a flowing, vital,
crammed-full-every-minute undergraduate life.
To Stanford these fledglings will provide the
stable platform for another flourishing fifty
years of existence.
No closed shop or mutual protection associa
tion, the Farm offers the platter of prestige and
position equally to every newcomer at its thresh
old. The student democracy of this institution
includes no Tammany-like rings in which posi
tions are awarded regardless of merit.
Beckoning fingers from wide-flung doorways
already call neophytes. The wheels of campus
activity are ready, but need the impetus of '44.
In the columns of The Daily, even in this is
sue, are announcements of tryout meetings from

which eager newcomers will emerge into the
whirlpool of campus activity. Penciled signa
tures upon signup sheets will soon launch them
into the industry ot rarm publications, ially
committee, glee club, concert series, team man
agerships, and the countless other positions
awaiting those who registered Monday.
Tonight Excom will name a new head for
Card File, committee through which interested
students, both new and old, gain positions upon
various committees and in many activities.
Within a few days after the appointment of the
new chairman, Card File will officially open for
business, and freshmen who want their years at
Stanford to count will make applications with
Card File workers.
Many are the interests which are offered to
the new student, but every bit as vital as the
offerings which our University makes to her
undergraduate members is the freshness of
thought and spirit brought to the campus by
each successive group of newcomers. The
growth of the Farm from the bawling infant of
1891 to the stalwart manhood of 1940 has been
a continuous record of undergraduate achieve
ments along undergraduate lines. The lusty
power of our Stanford will remain only as long
as her students retain the clear thinking spirit
of progress characteristic of the fifty years
which will soon be over.
Monday morning Joseph D. Grant, Stanford's
oldest living trustee, pointed a searching finger
at the basic characteristic of those first fifty
years when he summed them up in these words:
"Sempervirens . . . ever-living and always
young."â€”W. C.
