/ I HARLES S. HOWARD, the prideful owner of the
horse Seabiseuit, champion of the turf, possesses
two more admirable qualities. One, more than enough
hundred-dollar bills, which if laid end to end would
reach to Santa Anita and back. And two, a stalwart
son, Lin, who attended Stanford back just a little under
20 years ago. Now, he trains thoroughbred race horses
for crooner Bing Crosby.
Recently Lin wrote us. At the bottom of his scrib
bled words, he ended his note by saying, "Hope you
have a good team and can take U.S.C. as on paper
they look about the best."
Perhaps Lin Howard is right. It might prove ex
tremely profitable to support his beliefs, since Lin has
a way of picking and doping the "right one" among
the many—despite the wisecracks made about the
horses he lashes around the tracks for Crosby. And
then, maybe not. Well, Lin Howard says that U.S.C.
looks best "on paper." We'll bet U.S.C. wouldn't look
so good on an examination paper. At least not after
hearing some of the stories about the athletes from
down south way.

summer a Stanford man, who really is as rug
ged as any olher college man. was racking pipe
in Southern California oil fields. Sweating in a neigh
boring crew was a hulky S.C. man, Johnny Stone
braker. Nobody can authoritatively say whether or
not Johnny returned to the Trojan campus this fall,
but this we do know. Last year and the year before
Mr. Stonebrakcr was playing football on the S.C. var
sity. In fact, it was that famous pass from Doyle
Nave to Stonebraker which defeated Duke University
in the Rose Bowl.
One day this summer, the boss of the racking crew
handed Johnny a drill and drill bit, and pointed to
the derrick platform, instructed our S.C. hero to drill
a few prescribed holes in the wooden planking. Mr.
Stonebrakcr began drilling, but he turned the drill the
wrong way. As a consequence the bit would and could
not bite into the planks. For ten minutes he twisted
the drill the wrong way.
Then looking up with childish wonderment he said,
"Chee, dis bit sure must be dull. I can't make it drill."
The onlookers, fast increasing in numbers, just nodded.
So, Mr. Stonebrakcr got a hammer and a nail and
pounded a hole in the plank. He explains that he is
doing that so as to give the bit a start. The onlookers
nod again.
Jonnhy took up drilling again, the wrong way. Min
utes—ls of them—pass. Still nothing seeps into his
unconsciousness. At last one of the giggling onlookers
suggests that he try turning the drill the other way.
And it works. Yes, sir, it works.
"You know," Stonebrakcr says, "if I'd had time I
could have figured it out for myself."
By golly, there's nothing like an S.C. education.

J JUGO DeCROOT is also an S.C. man. Ho th rows the
javelin for the Trojans. Last year the whole track
team took a bus jaunt to a northern college. Long
the bus grunted over the Grapevine route; and then it
plunged into the steaming desert. Five hours out of
Los Angeles as the bus approached Bakersfield, Hugo
suddenly looked up and stated, "Well, fella's, in a
little while we'll be in Santa Barbara."
"But we ain't going to Santa Barbara this time,
Hugo."
No? You know, I thought we were taking a long
time."
By golly, there's nothing like an S.C. education.

Nave to Stonebraker which defeated Duke University
in the Rose Bowl.
One day this summer, the boss of the racking crew
handed Johnny a drill and drill bit, and pointed to
the derrick platform, instructed our S.C. hero to drill
a few prescribed holes in the wooden planking. Mr.
Stonebrakcr began drilling, but he turned the drill the
wrong way. As a consequence the bit would and could
not bite into the planks. For ten minutes he twisted
the drill the wrong way.
Then looking up with childish wonderment he said,
"Chee, dis bit sure must be dull. I can't make it drill."
The onlookers, fast increasing in numbers, just nodded.
So, Mr. Stonebrakcr got a hammer and a nail and
pounded a hole in the plank. He explains that he is
doing that so as to give the bit a start. The onlookers
nod again.
Jonnhy took up drilling again, the wrong way. Min
utes—ls of them—pass. Still nothing seeps into his
unconsciousness. At last one of the giggling onlookers
suggests that he try turning the drill the other way.
And it works. Yes, sir, it works.
"You know," Stonebrakcr says, "if I'd had time I
could have figured it out for myself."
By golly, there's nothing like an S.C. education.
