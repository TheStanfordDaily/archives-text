## ENCINA DIGS IN 
### 
THE EDITOR, SIR:
Although our eyes and our teeth are not back in
yet, we could see through our missing orbs a biting
untruth in today's Bull Session, and we can say
through our missing teeth that if there is any simi
larity between Encinamen and gophers, there is all
too much striking resemblance between the queer
species inhabiting Roble and a well filled and very
lumpy Trample-Toy laundry bag.
Frankly speaking, take off their mascara and war
paint, and exactly what have you got? There are no
queens in the Roble deck, just a bunch of Jokers. We
want a New Deal.
Of course, all this reminds us of the celebrated
ballad. "The Blues in My Flat," in which the mean
ingful chorus pleads, "Give me back that wig, you
don't need no hair."
In conclusion, may we state that we men of Encina
were deeply shocked, and seriously wounded by the
subtle, but nevertheless pointed reference to not only
the eyes and teeth (wherever they are) but the truly
cruel description of us as "beasts of the soil."
Come on, fellow gophers, let's dig holes, and let
the Roble corpses shovel their usual dirt over us.
