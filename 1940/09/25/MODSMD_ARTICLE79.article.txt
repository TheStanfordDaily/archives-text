# Gay 'Baker's Wife' Tells Tale of Rural High Jinks
## "THE BAKER'S WIFE" and "THE RAMPARTS WE WATCH." 
### 
There is something about the end
of the quarter that inspires review
ers to make side remarks about the
most innocuous little films. But this
is the beginning of the quarter.
Classes haven't started yet, reg day
left no scars that won't heal with
proper care, and this department is
going to go overboard about a movie.
'The Baker's Wife" ("La Femme
du Boulanger" to those of you who
go to improve your accent) is a pic
ture that will revive your faith in
pictures. It has a good plot, con
sistently good acting, good dialogue,
a good musical score, and photogra
phy that's good without being obtru
sive.
ERSKINE'S CAPTIONS
The mood of the piece is set
beautifully by John Erskine's sly
prologue. Don't worry about the
French. Erskine is a Ph.D. who un
bent so far as to write "Helen of
Troy" and his English titles are com
plete and witty.
BREAD AND THE FRENCH
Tlie story is about a baker and a
beautiful wife. The life of a French
village is inextricably bound up
with that of the baker, for good
bread means a great deal to a
Frenchman. Thus, when the baker's
wife runs away with an Italian shep
herd and the baker lets his oven
fires go out, the entire village con
spires to bring her back.
It's a simple story about humble
people, but the theme of tolerance
and human kindness is in every act
and word. However, the French
sense of humor is too great to let
the picture sink into a saccharine
morass, and the satire on village life
is double-edged and sharp.
RAIMU STARS
As the Baker, Raimu shows why
he is considered France's greatest
comedian. Comedy, to him, isn't
ludicrous situations; it's believable
foibles depicted with superb finesse.
He can make you laugh and he can
also make you cry; in either case
he will never exaggerate a gesture
or an expression.
LeCLERC PLAYS WIFE
Ginette LeClerc is his erring wife.
She is called upon to do about as
little as any member of the cast ex
cept the shepherd. They both just
look intense.
CHARACTERS SUPERB
Every other characterization is su
perb. The atheistic school teacher,
the unctious priest, the gallantly
lecherous marquis, and each sepa
rate villager is a definite person.
Probably "The Baker's Wife" will
be the last of a series of great
French movies—"Mayerling," "Gen
eral Without Buttons," "Story of a
Cheat." I don't imagine Hitler's ver
sion of the Hayes Office would be
so foolish as to let a picture of the
caliber of "The Baker's Wife" past
its eagle eyes. All this propaganda
for tolerance is definitely subversive.
"Life," "Time," and "Fortune's"
much-publicized "The Ramparts We

Watch" is a melange of ncwsreels
and Allied propaganda, bolstered not
at all by some very poor amateur
acting.—Nowell
