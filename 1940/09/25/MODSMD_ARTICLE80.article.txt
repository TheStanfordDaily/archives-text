# Disputed Bills May Be Voted

WASHINGTON, Sept. 24 (UP).—
A continuous session until the new
Congress convenes next January ap
peared probable tonight after Sen
ate Democratic Leader Alben W.
Barkley was advised the House
probably would reject proposals
for adjournment or long recesses.
Barkley told the Senate that
House Speaker Sam Rayburn had
informed him the lower chamber
"probably will not" vote to ad
journ Congress sine die but prob
ably will insist on short recesses.
"If that is the attitude of the
House," Barkley said, "we'll be here
until Christmas."
A continuous session might result
in action on disputed bills, which
have been shelved because of ear
lier adjournment plans. Such legis
lation includes the House-approved
amendments to the Wagner Labor
Act, the House-approved Logan-
Walter bill, proposed constitutional
amendments to limit presidential
tenure of office, and other proposals
that might prove embarrassing to
the Administration in an election
year.
Barkley's announcement came as
the Senate was involved in a heated
battle over the Logan-Walter meas
ure, which would provide for court
review of rules and regulations of
quasi-judicial federal agencies.
Led by Senator Edward R. Burke,
D„ Neb., a group of anti-New Deal
Democrats sought to force Senate
action on the measure.
The Senate defeated, 51 to 18, a
motion by Burke to give the meas
ure priority over all other legisla
tion.
