JS <1 TAKE NOTICE!
Back to'school' Whether you're a wide-eyed
Freshman or a sophisticated Senior, much of
your fun and achievement during Ibe coming
term will depend upon your grooming. Each
day will bring new pleasures. Hectic regis
tration days, informal "rushing" teas, frivolous
proms . . . don't let them catch you with a
leftover Summer permanent. Be smart â€”rate
an "A" in this subject of grooming by calling
us immediately for an appointment.
