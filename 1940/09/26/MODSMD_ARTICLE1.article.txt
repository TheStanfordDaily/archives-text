WINCE the enactment of the "Se
* iective Training and Service Act
of 1940"—better known as the draft
law—a good deal of loose talk has
been heard concerning the contents
of the bill that was finally passed
by Congress and signed by the
President. Separate bills appeared
from both branches of Congress and
a conference committee produced the
Jinai version wnicn nas become law.

With the matter under discussion
in the newspapers for many weeks,
most students know something
about the conscription law but few
know its exact provisions. With this
in mind, History today will discuss
the law, boiling it down to the es
sentials.

" President Roosevelt has proclaimed
Oct. 16 as National Registration Day.
Every male, citizen and alien resid
ing within the United States, be
tween the ages of 21 and 36 must
register at the nearest designated
registration office.
Although college students with
in this age group must register,
they are exempt from the draft
until the end of the 1940-41 col
lege year. The law provides that
no more than 900,000 men may he
called for training at any one time
unless Congress has declared "the
national interest imperiled."

CO FAR as is possible the trainee
k will be guaranteed the return
of his job. Federal district attorneys
will represent without fee train
ees seeking their former posi
tions. The law specifies that train
ees shall be restored to a position of
"like seniority, status, and pay un
less the employer's circumstances
have so changed as to make it im
possible or unreasonable to do so."
Trainees may vote in any election
in which they ordinarily are en
titled ty vote as civilians. No more
than a day's leave may be granted
for this purpose, but the trainee may
vote through an absentee ballot.
Blanket exemptions from regis
tration arc confined to various
classes of men who have had mili
tary experience. Among these arc
"cadets of the advanced course,
senior division, Reserve Officers
Training Corps." R.O.T.C. stu
dents who have signed the govern
ment contract for the advanced
course — who have signified their
intentions of completing the four
years of R.O. — are exempt from
registration.

| OCAL boards will review cases
for deferment or exemption from
service and the President is author
ized to prescribe further exemption
or deferment categories. For in
stance, aircraft workers may be given
deferment.
SIGNIFICANCE—MiIitary experts
are agreed that the defense program
of the United States requires an ex
panded army and a large reserve of
(rained man power. In spite of an
enlistment program and the raising
of pay of army privates, the army has
not been able to gain the necessary
number of recruits. The draft law
will train millions of men over a
period of years, offering no tremen
dous hardship to any individual with
Ihe training period limited to one

Totalitarian states have little dif
ficulty in conscripting men, or any
thing else for that matter, and the
United States must recognize the
possibility of conflict with any one
of the totalitarian states. Her man
power must be prepared; but train
ing here will be assumed in the
democratic way.
