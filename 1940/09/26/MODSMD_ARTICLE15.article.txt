### 
LONDON, Sept. 25 (UP). —
Royal Air Force bombers were re
ported Wednesday to have "suc
cessfully blasted" big power
plants, arms factories in the heart
of Berlin and touched off a series
of tremendous explosions at Ger
man "invasion bases" on the
French coast.
British bombers attacked Brest
and set fire to infantry barracks and
damaged the rocks, where vast
flames poured into the sky from
around a railway siding.
The counter-blows against Ger
many intensified as the British
bombers continued to strike at vital
Nazi objectives.
The successful,raid on the German
capital for the third successive night
was reported after dispatches told
of tremendous explosions on the
French side of the Channel, some of
them so great they shook the British
coast.
In a bombing attack on Nazi-held
Calais that lasted nearly seven hours,
barges lying alongside quays were
hit and fires and explosions were
seen in many parts of the harbor.
DAKAR SIEGE ABANDONED

three-day siege of the French West
African port of Dakar and withdrew
her warships and planes after fail
ing to overpower French resistance
and land British and "Free French"

An official announcement said the
siege was called off when it became
evident only a destructive naval
battle of major proportions could
bring about Dakar's fall.
