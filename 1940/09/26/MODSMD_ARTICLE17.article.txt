BERLIN, Thurs., Sept. 26 (UP).—
British bombers raided the German
capital for the fourth successive
night last night, causing an air raid
alarm of five hours — the longest
since the war began.
An official communique stated:
"Last night British planes again
attacked the capital and dropped
bombs aimlessly at several points on
private houses. Several houses and
smaller summer houses were de
stroyed and others were damaged."
Well informed German quarters
said none of the bombs fell on any
military objective.
