YELLS, SONGS PLANNED
Noise, noise and yet more noise
will be the theme of tonight's spir

Snoddy, and in case the roof hap
pens to be raised, the Corporation
Yard stands by only too willing to
slap on another, he adds.
Head Yell King Gordy Nicoll, as
sisted by Charley Van Deusen, Joe
Messina, and the Stanford Band,
will swing out on "Come Join the
Band" to unleash grandstand sup
port for the season's opener.
Recognizing a good thing when
they see it, U.S.F. Student Body
President Tony Tarantino and his
head yell leader will desert the
northern campus for the Farm to
night to help grease local vocal
chords.
SIIAUGIINESSY TO TALK
Coach Shaughnessy and Bruce
Jessup, A.S.S.U. president, will give
the rooters brief pre-game chalk
talks, and the entire Indian squad
will be on hand.
Rally Committee Chairman Pat
Smith and Bill Kimball promise the
pep session will end in time for the
transfer jolly-up scheduled for 8:30
o'clock, to be held in the Women's
Gym.
Snoddy is being aided in the direc
