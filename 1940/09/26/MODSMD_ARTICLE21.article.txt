# Summer Drama To Be Encored
## 
### 
"She Stoops to Conquer," by
Oliver Goldsmith, a success in Stan
ford's summer theater, will go on
the boards in a repeat performance
for a two-night season opener Oct. 4
and 5 in Memorial Theater.
Dr. Margery Bailey, who "wowed"
summer audiences with the "relish
and gusto" with which she played
the part of Mrs. Hardcastle, will
again play in the production. Topped
by a towering white wig, Dr. Bailey
played the part to the hilt, accord
ing to reviewers, and brought to life
the citified provincial lady who is
bored with the provinces.

Bud Cady, who paralleled Dr.
Bailey in excellence of performance,
will again take the part of Tony
Lumpkin, the country lad who is a
combination of 18th century Jimmy
Durante and Mortimer Snerd. Cady
played his part as pure slapstick and
got away with it.

F. Cowles Strickland, director, is
presenting the play in its full five
parts instead of the modernized
Ihree-act version, and it played as
Goldsmith wrote it. That is, rowdy,
instead of handled with kid gloves
after the modern way of handling
18th century plays.

The alternate title of the piece,
"The Mistakes of a Night," gives an
indication as to the character of the
play. Rural colloquialisms relieve
the balanced 18th century dialogue,
and the practical jokes which run
thlough the performance show the
country bumpkin nature under the
veneer of the landed gentry of the
times.
