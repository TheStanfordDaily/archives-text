# Shaughnessymen Continue Drills Against Don Aerial Plays; Near-sellout Looms
## 
### 
Coach Clark Shaughnessy continued his relentless drilling of the var
sity hackfield against U.S.I', pass plays in yesterday's practice. Assistant
Coach "Husky" Hunt's supply of Don aerial formations seemed endless as
he supplied the diagrams for a fourth-string outfit which fired countless
passes against the first and second-string backfields.

Drilling on this defense were Norm*
Standlee and Milt Vucinich at the |
line backing, fullback spot, and I
Doug Stahle and Vic Lindskog at
the other line backing position.
COMBINATIONS TRIED
Hugh Gallarneau and Eric Arm- i
strong alternated at one half and |
Pete Kmetovic and John Casey at j
the other. Frank Albert and Ray |
Hammett took their turns at quarter.
Hard-luck Johnny Kerman, in
jured last year just when he had
found himself and slightly damaged
early in this season's practice, re
turned to the squad yesterday.
However, Johnny was in condition
only to do a lot of listening and
little actual work as he watched the
two first strings go through their
defensive capers.
SELLOUT PROMISED
Saturday's contest against the
Dons promises to be a sellout if not
for reason of some good football,
because of the mystery element of
the game. Every football fan wants
to see the Shaughnessy system in
action, wants to know if Stanford
has enough football talent to set i
them on the comeback trail.
Fans and players alike are in the
dark as to who will win the starting
positions when Saturday afternoon j
rolls around. It will be Armstrong i
Willard, Fred Meyer, Clemmie
Tomerlin, or "Bosco" Graff at the
two ends.
VARSITY SLUGGISH
Hot weather and hard work has ]
slowed the varsity to a walk in their
practice sessions and they lack the
fire apparent in earlier workouts.
They are still absorbing useful hints
about the Don's offense and a few
scientific pointers about the se
quence of their own multitude of
plays.
The season's first rally will be
held tonight in the Pavilion in order
to give Shaughnessy a chance to tell
the student body what kind of a
football team it has and what the
chances are in the opening tilt Sat
urday.
BRONCS TO BE SCOUTED
Saturday afternoon will provide
the Cardinals an excellent chance of
scouting their future rivals, the
Santa Clara Broncos. The Broncos
meet Utah earlier in the afternoon,
at 12:30 o'clock, to open the first
bona fide grid double header in
football history.
Always a strong team, the Broncos
will have to perform before the
searching eyes of the entire Indian
coaching staff and team for at least
one half before the Cards have to
head for the locker room to dress for
their own debut.
