BERKELEY, Sept. 25 (UP). â€”
Coach "Stub" Allison directed his
California Bears through a light
workout today in hopes of finding a
triple-threat right halfback to re
place Jim Jurkovich, sensational
sophomore injured in yesterday's
scrimmage. Jurkovich is expected to
stay on the sidelines two weeks. His
understudy, Harry Lieb, was in
jured last week, and will be kept on
the bench at least a month.
