### JERRY BRUCKER 
EDWIN N. ATHERTON
CALLS ON STANFORD
Strong men trembled, and weak
men did whatever it is that weak
men do when strong men tremble,
yesterday. The reason was a flying
visit paid to the Farm by Edwin
Atherton, Pacific Coast Conference
cleaner-upper and house dick.
Mr. Atherton, who proved any
thing but a ray ot'sunshine to a
good many people in the vicinity
of Berkeley and Los Angeles a
month or two ago, held court
until :Â» o'clock yesterday afternoon
in a B.A.C. office, then skipped out
to catch a train for Los Angeles.
The Coast Athletic Czar has been
active in the Northwest recently,
visiting Washington, Washington
State, Oregon, and Oregon State. Be
fore leaving Stanford he promised
Don Liebendorfer to return next
Tuesday.
A few weeks ago, shortly after the
| historic "First Blitzkreig," Atherton
announced that further develop
ments would be forthcoming around
] September 28, so it wouldn't sur
i prise lis much if the Conference po
! I ice man touched off another bomb
shell from Los Angeles in the very,
very near future.
hi the meantime, children, hold
I onto your hats, and don't forget to
add a "and God bless (he frosh
football team" to your prayers
I every night.
