# SO THAT'S HOW THE AGGIES BLOCK
## 
### 
This little yarn is a trifle ancient,
but word of mouth communication
being rather uncertain, it just reach
ed this part of the country.
It concerns a guard on the Texas
A. and M. football team last fall in
the Sugar Bowl game. The Aggies
had the ball. Coming out of the
huddle, this guard swaggered up to
the line of scrimmage and got into
position. He looked over at the man
playing opposite him.
"I don't know where you're
going, brother, but I'm getting out
of here. Kinibrough's coming
through."
