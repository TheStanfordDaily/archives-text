# One-legged Golfer Sinks Hole-in-One
## 
### 
WINNIPEG, Sept. 25 (UP).—Ca
nadian golfers doffed their hats to
day to C. J. Scott, latest member of
the Winnipeg hole-in-one fraternity.
It was just a 120-yard hole but —
Scott has just one leg. He tours the
links on crutches and uses a one
handed swing on all his shots.
