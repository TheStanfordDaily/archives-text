# Papoose Squad Polishes Attack
## 
### 
l This season's frosh griddcrs
may or may not prove t»> be the
lsest yearling squad at Stanford
i in recent years, but one thing
seems quite probable: it will be
the "passingest"' outlil of them
! all.
That may sound a bit far-fetched
; to anyone who saw Frankie Albert
| and the 1938 freshman gridders;
: however, the way Coach Harry
j Shipkey is working his team on an
I aerial attack strongly indicates that
j he is going to turn out a pass-con
scious eleven.
PASSING PRACTICED
For the second day in a row
Shipkey sent his charges through
another session of pass offense yes
terday. Furthermore, he plans to
hold scrimmages today and tomor
row afternoons, and Saturday
morning—with passing as the fea
ture.
Working on the theory that it is
better to work on one phase of the
game at a time and co-ordinate
them after they have been mastered
individually, Shipkey plans to give
his outfit lots of work on a running
attack next week, by which time
they should have their pass plays
down pretty well.
SHIPKEY OPTIMISTIC
"From the way we are going, it
looks like we're going to have
plenty to throw at our opponents
this year," says Shipkey. "I am
very enthusiastic about the passing
possibilities from the Shaughnessy
single wing," he adds. "As a mat
ter of fact, it is the best set-up for
a passing attack that I've run into
I in all my years of coaching."
At present Bob Mitchell, who is
alternating with Frank Forbes at
! left half on the first outfit, has
shown himself to be the best passer.
