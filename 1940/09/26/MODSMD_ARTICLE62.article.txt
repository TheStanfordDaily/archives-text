EXCOM last night breezed through a handful
of committee appointments, tackled one or
two major issues, and finally decided to let one
of these issues straighten itself out.
After a three-year trial period in which re
sults were not forthcoming, the Activities Card
File popped up on President Bruce Jessup's
docket of business for the evening. Created to
fill the need for willing committee-workers in a
democratic way, Card File has had a succession
of chairmen who have resigned control when
they realized that their efforts were going to
waste.
The theory of such a system of choice is
sound—it has all the earmarks of being an
equitable arrangement for springing eager ac
tivities-workers into the Farm's extra-curricular
whirl.
What could be more logical than creating a
system whereby those interested in taking part
in Associated Students jobs might register their
qualifications and ambitions? And what could
be more reasonable than requiring committee
chairmen to choose workers by means of the
card-file classifications?

But, search as you may, it would be difficult
to find any student who was ever called be
cause of card-file application to fill any com
mittee job. It just hasn't worked.
The fault lies, perhaps, no so much with the
idea but with its application. No one could dis
credit the theory as being undemocratic and
unreasonable. But committee chairmen are in
nately suspicious of talent which has not been
tried. And, slave as they may, officials of the
File have been unable to force appointees to
pick their staffs from the File's long lists of
would-be participants. The result of the whole
procedure lies in a dusty room in Old Union.
And its failure has come from a lack of trial, and
not from error.

It is absurd to think that Stanford committee
chieftains will reform suddenly and miracu
lously. We do not expect the next batch of
appointments to come directly from the tar
nished steel cabinets and yellowed pages of
the Great File. No, the Activities File will prob
ably continue, a surface pretense at a demo
cratic method of handling committee assign
ments.
And the tough part of the problem is that
Excom, though it may wrestle with the issue,
will have a difficult time re-shaping the whole
activities picture in order to insure the success
of the White Elephant its predecessors created.

After a three-year trial period in which re
sults were not forthcoming, the Activities Card
File popped up on President Bruce Jessup's
docket of business for the evening. Created to
fill the need for willing committee-workers in a
democratic way, Card File has had a succession
of chairmen who have resigned control when
they realized that their efforts were going to
waste.
The theory of such a system of choice is
sound—it has all the earmarks of being an
equitable arrangement for springing eager ac
tivities-workers into the Farm's extra-curricular
whirl.
What could be more logical than creating a
system whereby those interested in taking part
in Associated Students jobs might register their
qualifications and ambitions? And what could
be more reasonable than requiring committee
chairmen to choose workers by means of the
card-file classifications?

But, search as you may, it would be difficult
to find any student who was ever called be
cause of card-file application to fill any com
mittee job. It just hasn't worked.
The fault lies, perhaps, no so much with the
idea but with its application. No one could dis
credit the theory as being undemocratic and
unreasonable. But committee chairmen are in
nately suspicious of talent which has not been
tried. And, slave as they may, officials of the
File have been unable to force appointees to
pick their staffs from the File's long lists of
would-be participants. The result of the whole
procedure lies in a dusty room in Old Union.
And its failure has come from a lack of trial, and
not from error.

It is absurd to think that Stanford committee
chieftains will reform suddenly and miracu
lously. We do not expect the next batch of
appointments to come directly from the tar
nished steel cabinets and yellowed pages of
the Great File. No, the Activities File will prob
ably continue, a surface pretense at a demo
cratic method of handling committee assign
ments.
And the tough part of the problem is that
Excom, though it may wrestle with the issue,
will have a difficult time re-shaping the whole
activities picture in order to insure the success
of the White Elephant its predecessors created.
EXCOM last night breezed through a handful
of committee appointments, tackled one or
two major issues, and finally decided to let one
of these issues straighten itself out.
