# The
						Malt of Freedom

DISTURBING to many college students, es
pecially west of the Rocky Mountains, is
the growing number of patriotic songs and
motion pictures currently being thrust upon the
American public.

A Stanford student walked out of "The Ram
parts We Watch," Life and Time Magazines'
cinematic essay on the social reactions which
drew America into World War I, and remarked
that he was distressed by the scattering of
applause which greeted scenes of Allied tri
umphs and the smattering of boos for such
figures as Kaiser Wilhelm 11.

His attitude, one that can be generally stated
as much more prevalent in the Far West than
in any other section of the country, was that
the picture was more or less directed toward
stirring interventionist support in this country
for the Allied cause.

This same attitude is found in the reaction of
many, perhaps even a majority, of the college
students toward certain short subject motion
pictures dealing with patriotic events in the
history of the United States, and with the influx
over the past years of patriotic songs.
The stand invariably taken is that these
demonstrations of patriotism are nothing more
than blatant, demagogical displays of rampant
nationalism; that they are no better than the

hysterical frenzy of National Socialism.
These people are right —and yet perhaps they
are entirely wrong. For while patriotism may
lead deviously to nationalism, it, nevertheless,
is something entirely different. In their abso
lutes they mean two entirely different things—
one being a manifestation of one's love for his
country, the other being a devotedness to the
nation as a whole tending to express itself in
national independence.
Actually, then, America's turn during the
past five years cannot necessarily be construed
as an attempt to lead the United States down the
path to war.
But where those who decry this new-found
faith in the western hemisphere have a basis
for their suspicions of war-mongering and hys
terical propaganda is in the fact that this pa
triotism, after having lain dormant for almost
fifteen years, is suddenly jammed down Amer
ica's throat. It is like that first beer after a sum
mer lying in the sun. You just can't handle it.
Then you realize just how good the old brew
really is, and go on a bat. In the meantime,
certain fortunate persons who have assimilated
a reasonable amount of the malt in steady ra
tions continue along the same pace—enjoying
their drink, but not allowing it to go to their
heads.
America forgot in the years from 1919 through
the middle 'thirties just how nice the flavor of
democratic living was. It was there for the tak
ing—to worship freely, to organize for social
and economic betterment, to do and say as one
saw fit.
But it took a war-mad Europe to show them
that such things were not to be taken for
granted. They didn't know that they were
privileged.
Now, forcibly made conscious of their ad
vantage, they are suddenly tasting a brew that
they had neglected. And their capacities just
can't stand the strain after the layoff.
If they had been connoisseurs, they would
have appreciated the flavor of the wine of per
sonal independence. They would have sipped
gently of it through the years, noting its bene
fits, its desirability.
But the American people who lustily sing
"God Bless America" or applaud a picture of
the American flag are no more nationalists than
is the college sophomore a drunkard w||en he
comes back after the summer and gets tipsy on
two stubbies.
The comparison is not ridiculous. They both
are just taking more than they are used to
handling.—G. M.
