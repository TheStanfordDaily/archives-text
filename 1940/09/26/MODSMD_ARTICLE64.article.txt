THE MARTINS AND THE COYS—FARM STYLE
goes on behind the scenes that rarely reaches
print. Perhaps you have caught the odor of it
from the pointed Campus Opinion letters which The
Daily so willingly prints from time to time. For a long
time now, members of the Stanford theater group—to
use the nicest terms imaginable—have protested The
Daily's coverage of their artistic works. Some of their
letters couldn't be printed. Some the government re
fused to carry in the mails.
"You literary lunatics don't know nothin' about de
theater," they bellow in their best down-stage tones.
"Why don't you send over somebody with culture to
cover our productions. You reporters ain't got no
polish. You don't have no knowledge of the theater
or you wouldn't say the things you do about our
acting."

arc harsh words, and bitter pills to swallow
from persons who know nothing about putting
out a newspaper. Like the pot calling the kettle black.
But enough of this bickering.
Pushed by Stanford students, Farm dramatics are,
or is (depending on how many times you care to go)
on the upgrade. The student actors work hard and
they work long.
In several weeks. Harry Quagmire Muheim, the
director of the whole clam bake, will announce try
outs for this fall's inevitable Big Game Gaieties. Mu
heim wants new and fresh talent. Muheim needs new
and fresh talent. And you can read those lines in
any way you see fit.
All kidding aside, though, there is no stigma to
acting here at Stanford. Several nice people have
taken to the Stanford stage, and that includes Muheim.

present Harry is gleaning the campus for mate
rial which will fit or can be sawed to fit into the
Gaieties. The Gaieties is a rowdy show, full of non
sense and nothing, full of laughs, full of niblets, and.
we might add, just full. It is a production for and
by the students, and some day the students are going
to find it out.
So if you have any ideas, songs, skits, jokes, which
you feel or at least hope might prove Gaieties mate
rial, look up Harry Muheim or one of his henchmen
around the campus. They possess a remarkably abun
dant ability for laughing. If your material holds the
slightest promise, you'll get a fair deal—and probably
a contract.
