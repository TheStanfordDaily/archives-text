## MICKEY AND THE DAILY 
### 
r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
For three years my Mickey has been going away
to Stanford and leaving us at home in a state of an
ticipation and anxiety. Needless to say, she never has
time to write, and consequently we hear from her
very infrequently. Youngsters these days don't seem
to realize that we parents are every bit as interested
in them and their school as we were in grammar school.

Perhaps I had better terminate my sentimental wan
derings and get to the point of this letter, which is
to express my appreciation to The Daily for making
it possible for those at home to be just a little bit
nearer to those we send away. It has been a great
comfort to receive my copy of The Daily every
morning, telling me of activities —especially when
Mickey doesn't write for weeks; and when she does
write, how much more understandable is the news. I
know that I speak for Stanford motherhood when I
offer my thanks to The Stanford Daily.
