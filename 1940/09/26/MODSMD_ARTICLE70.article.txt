"MRS. MINIVER," by Jan Struther. Harcourt, Brace and Company, $2. !
Every year or so a perfect small book appears which is written with
delicacy and warmth, and so skillfully that it is recommended from reader
to reader, until it is America's best seller, and its admirers are ranged in
rival camps, trying to explain why it is worth while. Such a book is

"Mrs. Miniver," written by Jan
Struther, and some people say read
it, you'll find out why, and others
say it's a scream it's so funny, and
it's the best thing since "With Mal
ice Toward Some."
Merely a collection of some 20-odd
short sketches which had been pub
lished in the London Times, "Mrs.
Miniver" is the gentle but stringent
account of an upper class English
family living through school and
Christmas, buying their first gas
masks, and driving down to Kent for
the holidays, all through the eyes
and the musings of Mrs. Miniver.
THE MINIVER FAMILY
There is Clem, her husband, al
ways accounted for; there's Vin; at
Eton, and Judy, who's saved her
money to buy a doll, and Toby, her
particular delight: she can never
figure out if his immobility is pre
occupation or just too many under
drawers.
The book is full of fine-drawn
moods, and the type of beautifully
etched poignancies that make you
say, that's it, I've felt just like that.
It has wryness and a little whimsy.
FAMOUS SPECULATIONS
Already celebrated is Mrs. Mini
ver's speculation: just what does a
windshield swipe say? What noise
does it make? She thinks it says
"beef tea." She struggles with a con
descending harpy who snoots their
Kentish home, Starlings, and watches
with glee when the female gets her
own. She watches Guy Fawkes' day
fireworks, digs lugworms for her
son's fishing, considers the danger of
living too near an easily bombed
power station.
You know her, and wonder if she
looks rather like Fay Bainter, or like
her author, who is tiny and has a
clear, serene voice, and is the only
woman ever to hold an editorial po
sition on the London Times.
YOU DON'T GUFFAW
But the book isn't funny, and
bears little resemblance to "With
Malice Toward Some," as inept a
piece of ill-breeding as had ap
peared in a long time. Sure, Mrs.
Miniver's droll. But it would seem
almost like appreciating Chaplin
because of his gag writers, to draw
a slender comparison, as to recom
mend the book because of an occa
sional crack.
Perhaps it's a "Good-bye, Mr.
Chips" with a touch of "Grandma
Called It Carnal." At any rate, "de
lightful" somehow is too impersonal
to describe Mrs. Miniver. Without
being a bit gossamer or elfin—and in
an almost sturdy fashion, it's en
chanting.—Gould

occupation or just too many under
drawers.
The book is full of fine-drawn
moods, and the type of beautifully
etched poignancies that make you
say, that's it, I've felt just like that.
It has wryness and a little whimsy.
FAMOUS SPECULATIONS
Already celebrated is Mrs. Mini
ver's speculation: just what does a
windshield swipe say? What noise
does it make? She thinks it says
"beef tea." She struggles with a con
descending harpy who snoots their
Kentish home, Starlings, and watches
with glee when the female gets her
own. She watches Guy Fawkes' day
fireworks, digs lugworms for her
son's fishing, considers the danger of
living too near an easily bombed
power station.
You know her, and wonder if she
looks rather like Fay Bainter, or like
her author, who is tiny and has a
clear, serene voice, and is the only
woman ever to hold an editorial po
sition on the London Times.
YOU DON'T GUFFAW
But the book isn't funny, and
bears little resemblance to "With
Malice Toward Some," as inept a
piece of ill-breeding as had ap
peared in a long time. Sure, Mrs.
Miniver's droll. But it would seem
almost like appreciating Chaplin
because of his gag writers, to draw
a slender comparison, as to recom
mend the book because of an occa
sional crack.
Perhaps it's a "Good-bye, Mr.
Chips" with a touch of "Grandma
Called It Carnal." At any rate, "de
lightful" somehow is too impersonal
to describe Mrs. Miniver. Without
being a bit gossamer or elfin—and in
an almost sturdy fashion, it's en
chanting.—Gould
"MRS. MINIVER," by Jan Struther. Harcourt, Brace and Company, $2. !
Every year or so a perfect small book appears which is written with
delicacy and warmth, and so skillfully that it is recommended from reader
to reader, until it is America's best seller, and its admirers are ranged in
rival camps, trying to explain why it is worth while. Such a book is

"Mrs. Miniver," written by Jan
Struther, and some people say read
it, you'll find out why, and others
say it's a scream it's so funny, and
it's the best thing since "With Mal
ice Toward Some."
Merely a collection of some 20-odd
short sketches which had been pub
lished in the London Times, "Mrs.
Miniver" is the gentle but stringent
account of an upper class English
family living through school and
Christmas, buying their first gas
masks, and driving down to Kent for
the holidays, all through the eyes
and the musings of Mrs. Miniver.
THE MINIVER FAMILY
There is Clem, her husband, al
ways accounted for; there's Vin; at
Eton, and Judy, who's saved her
money to buy a doll, and Toby, her
particular delight: she can never
figure out if his immobility is pre
occupation or just too many under
drawers.
The book is full of fine-drawn
moods, and the type of beautifully
etched poignancies that make you
say, that's it, I've felt just like that.
