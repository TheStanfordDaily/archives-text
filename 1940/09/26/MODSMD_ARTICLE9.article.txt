# Cal to Observe Farm Co-op Book Exchange Organization
## 
### 
The Stanford Book Exchange Co
op will entertain two representatives
from the University of California to
day as part of a far-reaching move
ment to establish a network of simi
lar organizations on every campus
of the Pacific Coast.

Irv Reichert, Jr., and Ted John
son, members of Cal's Welfare
Council, have been sent down to the
Farm for the express purpose of
looking over our Book Exchange
with an eye to the possibilities of
starting one on the Berkeley campus.

Ever since the Pacific Coast Stu
dent Co-operative League was
formed, its prime objective has been

the co-ordination and extension of
student co-operatives. This aim was
emphasized when the league met at
Eugene, Ore., this summer. Book
exchanges can serve a two-fold pur
pose: exchanging books with the
students of the campus on which
they operate, and with neighboring
campuses as well. In this way the
student is assured of getting the
highest possible amount from the
sale of his used book.

Already U.S.C., San Jose, and
Modesto Junior College have estab
lished co-operative book exchanges.
The University of California may
be next.
