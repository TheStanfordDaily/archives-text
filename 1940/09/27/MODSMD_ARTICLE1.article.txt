few A CLASH between Japan • • •
and America . . . now .seems
inevitable." This is the slashing
statement from an afternoon edition
of one of Tokyo's influential papers
yesterday, and other papers carried
equally spirited comments.
The situation in the Far East
yesterday continued to make news
of the bombings in Berlin and
almost insignificant in
comparison. With a crisis already
impending, President Roosevelt
early yesterday afternoon issued
an order to stop the flow of Amer
ican scrap iron and steel to all
countries outside of this hemi
sphere with the exception of Great
Britain. Japan has dreaded just
this move since the start of her
forceful penetration of the Asiatic
continent several years ago. Two
months ago, the President pro
claimed an embargo on aviation
gasoline, a product that Japan has
had the greatest difficulty in mak
ing herself. Commerce department
statistics reveal that in 1939 Japan
imported from the United States
the astounding total of 1,155,536
tons of scrap iron. Britain in the
same year took only 254,234. Per
haps the Tokyo newspaper -that
spoke of war between Japan and
the United States had access to
these figures.

B UT the Japanese has other rea
sons not to be jubilant. Two
days ago the Export-Import Bank
loaned China another $25,000,000.
This sum would not only strengthen
materially China's resistance, but it
would also strengthen their already
sorely taxed morale.
From travelers arriving in Shang
hai from Japan come reports of ris
ing anti-American sentiment in the
Japanese capital. An organization
of retired army officers has peti
tioned the government to demand
from the United States clarification
of our attitude toward Singapore.
The petition further demanded that
if the reply of the United States was
unsatisfactory Japan should seize
both Hong Kong and Singapore.
These are bellicose statements, and
(hey are significant because they
come from an army group in a
country where the army is particu
larly influential.

disturbing news
1 came from Shanghai. In fact,
it is possible that the Japanese
are already taking preliminary
steps to seize the city. Press dis
patches reveal widespread strikes
and several incidents of violence
in the International Settlement
yesterday. Investigating police at
tributed the disorders to Japanese
agents.
Berlin announced yesterday the
signing of a document of "historical
importance" with Italy and Spain.
Contents of the agreement were not
disclosed but it was felt that the
Dakar incident and the current ten
sion in the Far East would prompt
some action or statement by the sig
natory powers. What any agreement
between these three nations would
mean in the Far East was far from
clear. Closer relations with Japan
have been hinted, but it is doubtful
if the Axis will be able to help
Japan in a crisis on the other side
of the world. It is equally doubtful
whether Spain could materially
alter the situation in Europe were
she to enter into closer relations
with Italy and Germany.
Two important events have gone
almost unnoticed in the news of the
past few days. First of all, the Brit
ish have offered the use of her Singa
pore facilities to the U. S. fleet. No
comment has yet come from the ad
ministration here. Secondly, the
British and Free French forces have
withdrawn entirely from the port of
Dakar, which several days ago they
attempted to storm. This must be
considered something of a setback
for the British. But the eyes of the
world for the next few days will
watch intently developments in the
Far East.
