sack slung over his shoulder, and
proudly shouted:
"Collier's!"
Before Whittlesey could recover
from his surprise at the youthful en
trepreneur's indignity, the young
one swung into his sales talk, ad
dressing the entire council:
MEETING DISRUPTED
"We got some really swell football
stories!"
He continued unabashed, "It's
worth a nickel, I'm tellin' ya!"
By this time he had reached Whit
tlesey at the head of the dining
table, who opened his mouth to ask
the youngster to leave.
But the salesman beat him to the
draw, with:
"Aw, c'mon, how 'bout it?"
At the hoots of his Council mem

dressing the entire council:
MEETING DISRUPTED

He continued unabashed, "It's
worth a nickel, I'm tellin' ya!"
By this time he had reached Whit
tlesey at the head of the dining

the youngster to leave.

"Aw, c'mon, how 'bout it?"
At the hoots of his Council mem

zine, and Persistence vanished into
the kitchen. "
