# Indians Make Bid to End Farm's Victory Famine With New Grid Machine
## Curtis to Start Veteran Backfield, Inexperienced Line in Crucial Debut Against Powerful Dons Tomorrow 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Tomorrow may well be the beginning of the end. The beginning of the
end of a devastating football famine which has swept the Farm for the
past two years.
For tomorrow the Cardinal eleven opens its 1940 grid season at ap
proximately 2:45 against the University of San Francisco in Kezar Sta
dium, San Francisco.
What makes the fans feel that tomorrow's opener may mark the end
of victoryless Indian teams is the element of newness surrounding foot-

ball on the Farm this season. Yes,,
there've been some changes made.
The coach is new; in fact, most of
the coaches are new; the system is
new; three of tomorrow's probable
starters are new to football; the
attitude toward football is new; the
spirit is new; and even the uni
forms will be new.

Overcast skies with a chilly wind
and the anticipation of the ap
proaching football debut fired up
the entire team as it rambled
through signal practice in yester
day's workout. There was lots of zip
and chatter as Coach Clark Shaugh
nessy and his pupils made eleventh
hour preparations for their tussle
with the Dons, and today also the
team will brush up some more on
its new, deceptive offense.
Two guards, a center, and a tackle
will probably open their var
sity football game tomorrow when
the Indians take the field. Three
hefty sophomores, all towers of
strength on last year's highly suc
cessful freshman team, are Chuck
Taylor and Dick ' Palmer at the
guards, and Bruno Banducci at right
tackle. The fourth is a junior col
lege transfer, Vic Lindskog, who
will get the call at center.
NOBODY KNOWS
On the performance of thus un
tried quartet, the very backbone of
the Indian line, may hinge the out
come of tomorrow's game and con
sequently of the entire season. For
with a Shaughnessy-eoached team
away to a flying start and a vic
tory-hungry student body behind
it, who knows what could happen?
The Cards have backfield men
