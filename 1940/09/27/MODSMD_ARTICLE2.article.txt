# Indians Make Bid to End Farm's Victory Famine With New Grid Machine
## Curtis to Start Veteran Backfield, Inexperienced Line in Crucial Debut Against Powerful Dons Tomorrow 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Tomorrow may well be the beginning of the end. The beginning of the
end of a devastating football famine which has swept the Farm for the
past two years.
For tomorrow the Cardinal eleven opens its 1940 grid season at ap
proximately 2:45 against the University of San Francisco in Kezar Sta
dium, San Francisco.
What makes the fans feel that tomorrow's opener may mark the end
of victoryless Indian teams is the element of newness surrounding foot-

ball on the Farm this season. Yes,,
there've been some changes made.
The coach is new; in fact, most of
the coaches are new; the system is
new; three of tomorrow's probable
starters are new to football; the
attitude toward football is new; the
spirit is new; and even the uni
forms will be new.

Overcast skies with a chilly wind
and the anticipation of the ap
proaching football debut fired up
the entire team as it rambled
through signal practice in yester
day's workout. There was lots of zip
and chatter as Coach Clark Shaugh
nessy and his pupils made eleventh
hour preparations for their tussle
with the Dons, and today also the
team will brush up some more on
its new, deceptive offense.
Two guards, a center, and a tackle
will probably open their var
sity football game tomorrow when
the Indians take the field. Three
hefty sophomores, all towers of
strength on last year's highly suc
cessful freshman team, are Chuck
Taylor and Dick ' Palmer at the
guards, and Bruno Banducci at right
tackle. The fourth is a junior col
lege transfer, Vic Lindskog, who
will get the call at center.
NOBODY KNOWS
On the performance of thus un
tried quartet, the very backbone of
the Indian line, may hinge the out
come of tomorrow's game and con
sequently of the entire season. For
with a Shaughnessy-eoached team
away to a flying start and a vic
tory-hungry student body behind
it, who knows what could happen?
The Cards have backfield men
galore but the line, this very cen
tei of the line, is the question mark
and maybe the key to a successful
HMO season. If Palmer, Lindskog,
and Banducci can open the holes
for pile-driving Norm Standlee and
hold off rushing linesmen long
enough to allow Frankie Albert to
••el his deadly pitching arm into
play, and if Chuck Taylor can pull
out of that line to knock down a
couple of tacklers on ofTnese, the
Indians are bound to roll,
(iKAFF TO START
Experienced and towering Jack
Warnecke will handle the other
tackle spot and a veteran of the
last two seasons, Stan Graff, will
start ai end. Last year's most ef
fective receiver for Albert's passes,
Freddie Meyer, will be at the other
i nd.
Shaughnessy's backfield has all
the qualities necessary for ground
gaining, ft has speed to sweep the
ends in Hugh Gallarneau and
chunky Pete Kmetovic, it has un
-1.1 stable power down the middle in
Norm Standlee, it has one of the
most effective passing arms on the
jtridiron today in Frankie Albert,
and a wealth of punting power in
Slandlee's Soaring boots and Al
bert's quick kicks.

But one of the most valuable as
pects of the Card offense will be
their new system and its direction
by cunning quarterback Albert. Ev
ery play is deceptive and a potential
long gainer and Albert, with lots of
variations at his command, will
cross up the Dons more than.once.
DONS EXPERIENCED
U.S.F.'s ability as a football team
cannot be underestimated. Their
biggest advantages over the Indians
are their well-rounded and expe
rienced team, and the fact that they
are playing a system they are fa
miliar with, not one they have
learned in the last six months.
In fact, they were so well rounded
and so well stocked with veterans
that, until this week, their coach,
George Malley, was planning to
use a two-team unit system. But
injuries to Stanley Mohr and Dick
Eisenlauer, leading tackle and
guard candidates respectively, have
forced Malley to change his tactics.
