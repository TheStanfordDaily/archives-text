# Wilbur Calls America 'Amusement-mad'; Asks Campus to Face Facts
## President Approved Conscription As 'Price of Freedom'; Reprimands America's Luxury-Seeking People 
### JERRY MAYER 
Americans will have to decide who their heroes areâ€”kings of swat or
the great scientists and writers who make and record the progress of the
world, Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur told 1,400 students and faculty members
yesterday from the Memorial Auditorium stage in the first all-University
assembly of the year.
After reading a letter from a former Stanford professor who is at
present interned in a concentration camp in Holland, Dr. Wilbur vigor-

indicted Americans as pro
vincial-minded people who are un
willing to take their places in the
scheme of today's world affairs.
"We are an amusement-mad na
tion that hates to face the disagree
able facts of today's upheaval," lsr.
Wilbur said. "In our attempt to find
security in a world torn by revo
lution, we are trampling upon the
minorities upon which this nation
is built. What America wants is
opportunity, not security, especially
when the latter means depriving
some of our essential free
dom."
INDO CHINA KEY
In bus denouncement of America's
provincial attitude, Dr. Wilbur drew
upon the Indo-Chinese situation as
an example.
"Few seem to realize," he de
clared, "that it is possible to get
from Indo-China a fire that will
light up the entire world."
He described the German people
as a nation which has contributed
greatly to world progress, but
which is currently being misled.
"If we are to keep our freedom,"
he asserted, "we must be alert and
wise and willing to struggle."
PRICE OF FREEDOM
Touching upon the recent univer
sal draft law, the President said:
"It is a terrible blow to be sub
jected to conscription in peace-time,
but if that is the price of freedom,
the sacrifice is worth while."
Calling upon the students to real
ize that they are world citizens, that
the world is too small for them to
remain aloof from Europe's devel
opments, Dr. Wilbur advised elec
tion to public office of men willing
to accept the fact of America's im
portance in the world situation,
rather than "impractical isolation
ists."
"Fifty years ago," Stanford's
President reminisced, "the bomb
ing of cities would have been un
heard-of. The human being has do
generated in his capacity to differ
entiate right from wrong. In fact,
thinking all over the world has
changed.
TIME FOR ACTION
"When there is a place in this
world where men such as these
professors sitting behind me arc
placed in concentration camps be
cause of the knowledge they pos
sess, it is time for us to forget base
ball heroes and orchestra leaders
and find out what we're going to
do."
Striking a strong 'concluding note,
Dr. Wilbur informed the students
that their responsibility was to
make certain that both America
\ and its educational processes were
"left irec, and that they continue
to grow free."
