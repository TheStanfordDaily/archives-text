# Stanfordites Take Naval Reserve Training Cruise
## Farm Men Turn Summer Sailors: Others Desert University This Fall 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
A sailor man gels plenty tired of beans and potatoes every day.
And working in engineroom temperatures of 165 degrees Fahrenheit
Isn't exactly a day in the country, either.
But. if anybody were to ask Bruce Jessup, A.S.S.U. president from the
Beta house, or Bob Anderson, Delt, what they really think of the Naval

Reserve training cruise, they'd say,
frankly:
"I wouldn't trade that month for
anything."
Seventeen Stanford men re
nounced claims on oil field jobs and
sunny beaches to don midshipmen's
middies this summer for the cruise
from New York to Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba, and Panama.
Seven more will desert the Farm
lor the high seas this fall. They are
Pete Kingsbury, "Pop" Barnard,
Red Lewis, "Swede" Johannessen,
Paul Rudolph, Stan Swafford, and
Bill Ernst.
FEW AMONG MANY
Jessup and Anderson were known
as V-7 men on the battleship U.S.S.
"New York." As members of Vol
unteers No. 7, they were among
1,500 young men representing every
college in the country. In convoy
with the "New York" were the
U.S.S. "Arkansas" and the U.S.S.
"Wyoming," each carrying its quota
of volunteers.
On the first of the two summer
cruises were Robert C. Collman,
'39. Bill. Doheny, Jack Treft, John
Ward, and John Faulsom.
The second contingent listed, be
sides Jessup and Anderson, Dick
Shortall, Phil Clayburgh, Robert
Pickering, Martin Mackey, A1 Hart,
Russ Berg, Ward Waddell, Carter
Kervin, Dale Kasl, and Clarke Wil
son.
OUT BEFORE DAWN
Rolled out by the bugle at 5:30
o'clock every morning, the boys
scrubbed decks and polished bright
work before breakfast, doing their
part in the Navy's program to train
5,000 men of at least two years' col
lege education. Only other quali
fication is physical fitness.
In regard to the 26-day cruise,
Jessup said:
"This was gravy, but* the three
months' training at Northwestern
next summer will be really tough."
To complete ensign training, vol
unteers are required to take three
months' instruction, in addition to
the cruise, at either Northwestern,
Annapolis, or on the U.S.S. "Illi
nois," in New York harbor.
"You should have seen the green

horns that first night out, said
Jessup. "The men in hammocks
were dropping like cocoanuts."
However, none of the volunteers
got seasick, as did a few of the
enlisted men!
Outlining the trip, Jessup said he
left Los Angeles with 165 other
men on a special train which car
ried them to New York.
"Did we see New York? We did
not. We were bundled right off the
train, onto a subway, onto a ferry,
and onto the ship. Just like that."
Clothing and bedding were issued
on the ship in New York hai'bor.
They sailed directly for Guantanamo
Bay, where they spent two days.
Both Jessup and Anderson described
Guantanamo as a washout.
NOTHING THERE
"We could do absolutely nothing,
because there was nothing there,"
Anderson said.
From Guantanamo they pro
ceeded to Colon, Panama Canal
Zone, where many of the men took
a train across the Isthmus to Panama
City. Jessup described the day in
Panama City as the best day of the
trip.
Back in Colon, they sailed for
Norfolk, Va., and the Portsmouth
Navy Yard, where they saw the
new aircraft carrier "Wasp." On
their return to New York, each man
was given $100 and turned loose.

Seventeen Stanford men re
nounced claims on oil field jobs and
sunny beaches to don midshipmen's
middies this summer for the cruise
from New York to Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba, and Panama.
Seven more will desert the Farm
lor the high seas this fall. They are
Pete Kingsbury, "Pop" Barnard,
Red Lewis, "Swede" Johannessen,
Paul Rudolph, Stan Swafford, and
Bill Ernst.
FEW AMONG MANY
Jessup and Anderson were known
as V-7 men on the battleship U.S.S.
"New York." As members of Vol
unteers No. 7, they were among
1,500 young men representing every
college in the country. In convoy
with the "New York" were the
U.S.S. "Arkansas" and the U.S.S.
"Wyoming," each carrying its quota
of volunteers.
On the first of the two summer
cruises were Robert C. Collman,
'39. Bill. Doheny, Jack Treft, John
Ward, and John Faulsom.
The second contingent listed, be
sides Jessup and Anderson, Dick
Shortall, Phil Clayburgh, Robert
Pickering, Martin Mackey, A1 Hart,
Russ Berg, Ward Waddell, Carter
Kervin, Dale Kasl, and Clarke Wil
son.
OUT BEFORE DAWN
Rolled out by the bugle at 5:30
o'clock every morning, the boys
scrubbed decks and polished bright
work before breakfast, doing their
part in the Navy's program to train
5,000 men of at least two years' col
lege education. Only other quali
fication is physical fitness.
In regard to the 26-day cruise,
Jessup said:
"This was gravy, but* the three
months' training at Northwestern
next summer will be really tough."
To complete ensign training, vol
unteers are required to take three
months' instruction, in addition to
the cruise, at either Northwestern,
Annapolis, or on the U.S.S. "Illi
nois," in New York harbor.
"You should have seen the green

horns that first night out, said
Jessup. "The men in hammocks
were dropping like cocoanuts."
However, none of the volunteers
got seasick, as did a few of the
enlisted men!
Outlining the trip, Jessup said he
left Los Angeles with 165 other
men on a special train which car
ried them to New York.
"Did we see New York? We did
not. We were bundled right off the
train, onto a subway, onto a ferry,
and onto the ship. Just like that."
Clothing and bedding were issued
on the ship in New York hai'bor.
They sailed directly for Guantanamo
Bay, where they spent two days.
Both Jessup and Anderson described
Guantanamo as a washout.
NOTHING THERE
"We could do absolutely nothing,
because there was nothing there,"
Anderson said.
From Guantanamo they pro
ceeded to Colon, Panama Canal
Zone, where many of the men took
a train across the Isthmus to Panama
City. Jessup described the day in
Panama City as the best day of the
trip.
Back in Colon, they sailed for
Norfolk, Va., and the Portsmouth
Navy Yard, where they saw the
new aircraft carrier "Wasp." On
their return to New York, each man
was given $100 and turned loose.
A sailor man gels plenty tired of beans and potatoes every day.
And working in engineroom temperatures of 165 degrees Fahrenheit
Isn't exactly a day in the country, either.
But. if anybody were to ask Bruce Jessup, A.S.S.U. president from the
Beta house, or Bob Anderson, Delt, what they really think of the Naval

Reserve training cruise, they'd say,
frankly:
"I wouldn't trade that month for
anything."

"New York." As members of Vol
unteers No. 7, they were among
1,500 young men representing every
college in the country. In convoy
with the "New York" were the
U.S.S. "Arkansas" and the U.S.S.
"Wyoming," each carrying its quota
of volunteers.
On the first of the two summer
cruises were Robert C. Collman,
'39. Bill. Doheny, Jack Treft, John
Ward, and John Faulsom.
The second contingent listed, be
sides Jessup and Anderson, Dick
Shortall, Phil Clayburgh, Robert
Pickering, Martin Mackey, A1 Hart,
Russ Berg, Ward Waddell, Carter
Kervin, Dale Kasl, and Clarke Wil
son.
OUT BEFORE DAWN
Rolled out by the bugle at 5:30
o'clock every morning, the boys
scrubbed decks and polished bright
work before breakfast, doing their
part in the Navy's program to train
5,000 men of at least two years' col
lege education. Only other quali
fication is physical fitness.
In regard to the 26-day cruise,
Jessup said:
"This was gravy, but* the three
months' training at Northwestern
next summer will be really tough."
To complete ensign training, vol
unteers are required to take three
months' instruction, in addition to
the cruise, at either Northwestern,
Annapolis, or on the U.S.S. "Illi
nois," in New York harbor.
"You should have seen the green

horns that first night out, said
Jessup. "The men in hammocks
were dropping like cocoanuts."
However, none of the volunteers
got seasick, as did a few of the
enlisted men!
Outlining the trip, Jessup said he
left Los Angeles with 165 other
men on a special train which car
ried them to New York.
"Did we see New York? We did
not. We were bundled right off the
train, onto a subway, onto a ferry,
and onto the ship. Just like that."
Clothing and bedding were issued
on the ship in New York hai'bor.
They sailed directly for Guantanamo
Bay, where they spent two days.
Both Jessup and Anderson described
Guantanamo as a washout.
NOTHING THERE
"We could do absolutely nothing,
because there was nothing there,"
Anderson said.
From Guantanamo they pro
ceeded to Colon, Panama Canal
Zone, where many of the men took
a train across the Isthmus to Panama
City. Jessup described the day in
Panama City as the best day of the
trip.
Back in Colon, they sailed for
Norfolk, Va., and the Portsmouth
Navy Yard, where they saw the
new aircraft carrier "Wasp." On
their return to New York, each man
was given $100 and turned loose.
