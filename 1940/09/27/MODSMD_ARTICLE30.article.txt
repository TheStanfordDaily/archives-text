# ANGLER'S BODY FOUND

MONTEJSEY, Sept. 26 (UP).â€”
The body of Tony Casanovas, 45,
San Pedro fisherman, drowned on
Tuesday at Point Joe, was recovered
today from the surf, almost at the
same spot where he fell into the
Pacific Ocean.
Because dry air lets heat leak
away much faster than does moist
air, desert air loses heat very rapidly
after sun Set.
