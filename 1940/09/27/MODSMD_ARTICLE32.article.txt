The Air Ministry said the surviv

The 46 persons were not taken

rOLL CUT DOWN
Immediately after the disaster, one
if the worst of the war at sea, the
3ritish government announced the

loss of 294 persons, including 83
children, and the rescue of 112 per
sons.
At that time the government aban
doned hope there would be any fur
ther survivors and Geoffrey Shake

Overseas Reception Board, had said
regretfully:
"The conditions were such that
there was little chance for passen
gers, whether adult or children, to
survive.
GALE SWAMPS BOATS
A strong gale—which swamped
several of the lifeboats—was blow
ing when a German submarine al
legedly torpedoed the Canada
bound liner.
