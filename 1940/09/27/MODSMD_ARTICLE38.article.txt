# Willkie Gives Farm Program, Endorses New Deal 'Purpose'
## 
### 
OMAHA, Nebr., Sept. 26 (UP).—
Wendell L. Willkie tonight endorsed
the "announced purposes" of the
New Deal farm program and pro
posed, if elected, to continue them
"subject to improvements."
Speaking in the heart of the corn
belt, carried by President Roose
velt in 1932 and 1936, Willkie out
lined a five-point farm program he
said was necessary "if we are to
achieve domestic economy recov
ery."
MAJOR FARM SPEECH
The address—his first major farm
was broadcast by stations of the Na
tional Broadcasting Company WJS
red network and was delivered be
fore 11,000 persons jammed into Ak
sar-ben Coliseum while 10,000 oth
ers filled the race track grandstand
across the road and others stood on
the track.
The crowd cheered for more than
two minutes when he was intro
duced by Kenneth Wherry, director
of the Willkie Nebraska campaign,
who asked that they stop to con
serve radio time. Willkie was in
terrupted frequently by applause.
GIVES PROGRAM
"This is my farm program," said
the Republican nominee. "Let us
take over—and improve if possible—
those elements of the present pro
gram that are helping the farmer
in his battle against the contracting

economy that the New Deal has
brought him.
"But let us not pretend," he con
tinued, "that that program is our
final solution. We must go back to
the roots of our trouble and by the
application of simple laws of eco
nomics, expand the domestic and
foreign markets.
Asserting the national farm policy
should be divorced from partisan
politics, Willkie said this country
never would return to the "situa
tion in which agriculture, because
of the ignorance of both parties,
was treated as a stepchild."
AI) LIBS FINALE
Speaking extemporaneously af
ter concluding his prepared text,
Willkie said if "we adopt the fan
tastic notion of the indispensable
man, this great democracy of ours
will pass.
"I say to you calmly and delib
erately in the heat of a political
campaign that in this last untouched
land of freedom our democracy will
pass if we continue down this road
of enormous fiscal deficits, of long
continued depression and experi
mental government.

ment base made from a volcanic
clay.
