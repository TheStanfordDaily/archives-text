# Garner Fights To End Session
## Says Long Congress Gives F.D.R. Power 
### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 26 (UP).—
Vice-President John Nance Gamer,
after two months' seclusion in his
Uvalde, Tex., home, returned to the
capital today and promptly opened
a drive to adjourn Congress sine
die late next week.
He talked to New Dealers, who
want to quit, and to conservative
Democrats who want to stay on to
keep an eye on the billions which
Congress has voted for defense and
the use of emergency powers
granted President Roosevelt.
Garner's theme song to all was:
The longer Congress stays in ses
sion, the more money it will vote
and the more power it will give to
the Chief Executive.
NOT FOR RECESS
He reportedly made it plain that
he does not favor proposed short
or long-time recesses. He wants
Congress to go home — and stay
there, his colleagues said. They
also said it is easier said than done.
Here is why:
The Administration is fighting in
the Senate to prevent consideration
of the Logan-Walter bill which
would subject rulings by federal
administrative agencies to court re
view. It has been approved by the
House.
HOUSE PROSPECTS DIM
Even with; this Senate tangle
cleared up, it is doubtful whether a
sine die adjournment resolution
could pass the House. Speaker Sam
Rayburn told Senate Majority
Leader Alben W. Barkley the pros
pects aren't bright. Garner still
retains considerable influence in the
House, but whether it is weighty
enough to tip the scales for ad
journment is not known.
A continuous session could em
barrass the Chief Executive's third
term campaign. It would make pos
sible consideration of such politi
cally explosive measures as pro
posed revision of the Wagner labor
law.
