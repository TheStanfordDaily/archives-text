# Soccer Coach Praises Squad
## 
### 
"The best practice I've seen in
all of my years of coaching. The
boys showed perfect spirit, co
ordination. and team work." That's
the praise Harry Maloney heaped
on his varsity soccer team after
the first practice of the season
yesterday afternoon.
The team showed top-season
form with remarkable passing and
defense work. Although the first
game will not be known until offi
cial approval of the schedule has
been made, eleven returning vet
erans and several stars from last
year's frosh outfit should produce a
winning team.
Tonight a captain for the 1940
season will be elected. Because a
senior is usually named, either Jack
Burnes, Fred Carnie, Lee Cham
pion, Wilson Clarke, George Dole,
Dick Harman, Gordy Nicoll, George
Lanicca, Ned Pugh, or Teller Wie
mann will be leader for the com
ing season.
Two teams, Cal Aggies and San
Francisco State, have been added to
the California Soccer League. As
a result of this addition, the teams
will play each other only once, ex
cept in the case of the Stanford-
California series where there will
be two games played. Other teams
in the conference are San Jose State,
University of San Francisco, Menlo
J.C., San Francisco J.C., and San
Mateo J.C.
Equipment for the freshman
team will be given out this after
noon at 2:30 with practice starting
at 4 o'clock.
