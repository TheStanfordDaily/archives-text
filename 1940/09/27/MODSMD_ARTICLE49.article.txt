### JERRY BRUCKER 
â–  WHO'LL WIN THAT
TUSSLE SATURDAY?
Comes a time in the life of every
; Daily sports editor when he must
| try to analyze Stanford's chances on
the field of sport. With Clark
Shaughnessy's Indians slated to
crack open the 1940 football season
against U.S.C. this Saturday, that
deadline has arrived, so, with a
little co-operation from Mr. Under
wood's torture machine, here goes.
The University of San Francisco
figures, on paper, to beat Stanford
by a safe margin, probably two
touchdowns. Coach George Malley
has a beefy, experienced, tough
J line and what appears to be a po
tent backfield built around hard
hitting Clin' Fisk and fleet-heeled
Marv Masconi. Only two regulars
are missing from a team that en
joyed a very successful season last
fall, losing only three games,
to St. Mary's of Texas, San Jose
State, and Fresno State.
On the other hand, Stanford
comes to the campaign with a green
squad made up mainly of holdovers
from last year's ill-fated eleven and
promising sophomores, a new coach,
and a new and intricate system.
It looks pretty bleak, doesn't it?
But that's just one side of the situa
tion. The other side is made up of
factors that aren't seen at first
glance, but that may have a lot to
do in determining who goes home
I happy and who doesn't Saturday.
The first of these factors is Head
Coach Clark Shaughnessy, and
more explicitly the brand of foot
'< ball he's teaching the squad. This
I new system, which has been kept
pretty well under cover, is de
signed to take foil advantage of the
many assets this Indian squad un-
J deniahly has. In the practice ses
| sions it looked like an ideal coin
j hination of speed, timing, and de
| ccption. Much of the offense is
patterned after that used by the
Chicago Bears. The system is a
; little more than moderately intri
cate, and execution may be a hit
ragged for the first game or two,
but it will- put the element of sur
| prise on the Stanfords' side.
It might be well to remark here
i (hat an unseasonable rainfall Satur
j day would make the Stanford stock
take a large drop. There's a lot of
"razzle-dazzle" in the new system,
and a wet ball would put a definite
crimp in the offense.
The Indians will have another im

| portant factor on their side, one of
j which Clark Shaughnessy will
probably make the most. The Farm
! team will almost certainly go into
' the game on the short end of the
odds, and the psychological effect of
being the underdog should give the
team all the fire it needs.
One of the main reasons a great
many people are picking the Dons
| is because of the comparative
scores against the only common
opponent last year. U.S.F. tied the
Broncs, 13-13, while the Shawmen
defeated Stanford. 27-7. Even for
getting the Farm football reorgani
zation for the moment, this is no
reason why George Malley's squad
should he favored.
Traveling back to that afternoon
last fall in the Stanford Stadium, we
find that a bad break cost the In-
I dians a tie, and a possible win,
! against the Broncs. The score was
14-7, the Indians had the ball and
had just made a first down. Frank'e
I Albert faded to pass, but the ball
; was blocked soon after leaving his
; hand and a big Bronco lineman
caught it in the air and went to a
touchdown.
If that pass had been complete, or
I anything but intercepted, Stanford
j might have gone on to score, as it
j was, the team collapsed and the
j Santa Clarans went on to win in
a walk.
