# Cross Country Workouts Start
## 
### 
"Pitch" Johnson, the Farm's new
track coach, conducted the first
cross-country workouts of the '40
season yesterday afternoon and
started work on the schedule which
winds up with the annual Cal meet.
"Our prospects are quite hard to
ascertain this early," Pitch said,
"but we'll certainly be hard hit by
the failure of Mush Girard and the
two Moores to return this fall. These
three veterans would have been
eligible for the fall sport and we
would have had a very dangerous
team with those boys in there."
Coach Johnson, who came out
from Drake this summer to take
over Stanford's track and field
forces, is gunning for an upset over
the powerful Bears. Although Stan
Sadaj and Ted Vollmer have left,
Cal will be strong in their specialty
of recent years, distance running.
