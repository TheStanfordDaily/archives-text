# Scribe Apologizes To Gehrig, Yanks
## 
### 
NEW YORK. Sept. 2G (UP).â€”The
New York Daily News and Jimmy
Powers, the newspaper's sports edi
tor. apologized today to Lou Gehrig
and the New York Yankees for sug
gesting, in a column published Aug
ust 18 that the retired first baseman
had infected his teammates with
poliomyelitis.
The apology followed by several
weeks the filing, in Gehrig's behalf,
of a $1,000,000 libel suit against
Powers, who wrote the story, and
the newspaper.
Powers said he had been motivated
only by desire to find a reason for
the Yankees' slump this year and
that hurting Lou Gehrig's ,feelings
was far from his mind.
Wasps seem to know the vital
spots of each type of organism upon
which they prey, and paralyze their
victims by stinging.
