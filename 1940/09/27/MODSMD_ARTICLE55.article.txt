# Shipkey Sends Gridders Through Mugged Scrum; First Eleven Looks Good
## 
### BY DON SELBY 
When Coach Harry Shipkey said that lie was going to scrimmage his
frosh gridders today, he wasn't fooling. For an hour and a half the Papoose
footballers went through a slam-hang scrum that saw more than one boy
come up with a nose-bleed or without a tooth.
After a session on live-tackling and a short, light punt scrimmage.

Shipkey told his boys to put on
their helmets and go to it. With the
third outfit on defense, the firsts
went to town in no uncertain man
ner as Frank Forbes, flashy left
half, rambled around the defensive
left end for 11 yards. Right half Jim
Troup followed this with another 11-
yard jaunt, this one over the de
fensive l ight tackle.
Both of these boys showed them
selves to be hard, fast, clever ball
carriers, while Randall "Buck" Faw
cett, husky fullback, provided the
punch down Ihe middle. On about
the tenth play the scrub troup
rambled 15 yards to pay dirt on a
reverse from Forbes.
When the seconds got into the
fracas they had a little trouble get
ting started but later they, too,
rolled up the yardage. Bob Mitchell,
who alternates on the first team with
Forbes, gave a fine exhibition of
passing, flipping a beauty to Bill
Brubaker for a score from 20 yards
out.
FULLBACK BATTLE
Outstanding as a blocker on the
seconds was Doyle Coldiron, who
also did some hard line plunging.
Coldiron ought to give Fawcett
some tough competition for the
starting b"rth at fullback.
Although the frosh do not seem to
have the outstanding backs that they
had last season, this year's team pre
sents a well-balanced eleven, with
a particularly effective line. Several
times llie first and second team lines
opened holes big enough for two
backs to go through abreast.
GOOD BACKS
Left halfback Lee Scott, who
worked with the third eleven, gave
evidence that he will make Mitchell
and Forbes fight for their position
as he ran and passed the thirds to a
near touchdown before one of his
passes was intercepted. Parsons, an
other left half, gives Shipkey quite
an imposing array of ball packers
irom the tailback spot when the
team shifts right. Right halves
Troup and Bob Koch also looked
good.
Yesterday the first team lined up
as follows: Jim Ellis and Bill Nourse,
ends; Jean LaMour and Bill Josslyn,
tackles; Kelly Ross and Dick Ab
laras, guards; Loren LaPrade. cen
ter; Jack Reynolds, quarter, Mitchell
and Troup, halves; and Fawcett, full.

frosh gridders today, he wasn't fooling. For an hour and a half the Papoose
footballers went through a slam-hang scrum that saw more than one boy
come up with a nose-bleed or without a tooth.
After a session on live-tackling and a short, light punt scrimmage.

Shipkey told his boys to put on
their helmets and go to it. With the
third outfit on defense, the firsts
went to town in no uncertain man
ner as Frank Forbes, flashy left
half, rambled around the defensive
left end for 11 yards. Right half Jim
Troup followed this with another 11-
yard jaunt, this one over the de
fensive l ight tackle.
Both of these boys showed them
selves to be hard, fast, clever ball
carriers, while Randall "Buck" Faw
cett, husky fullback, provided the
punch down Ihe middle. On about
the tenth play the scrub troup
rambled 15 yards to pay dirt on a
reverse from Forbes.
When the seconds got into the
fracas they had a little trouble get
ting started but later they, too,
rolled up the yardage. Bob Mitchell,
who alternates on the first team with
Forbes, gave a fine exhibition of
passing, flipping a beauty to Bill
Brubaker for a score from 20 yards
out.
FULLBACK BATTLE
Outstanding as a blocker on the
seconds was Doyle Coldiron, who
also did some hard line plunging.
Coldiron ought to give Fawcett
some tough competition for the
starting b"rth at fullback.
Although the frosh do not seem to
have the outstanding backs that they
had last season, this year's team pre
sents a well-balanced eleven, with
a particularly effective line. Several
times llie first and second team lines
opened holes big enough for two
backs to go through abreast.
GOOD BACKS
Left halfback Lee Scott, who
worked with the third eleven, gave
evidence that he will make Mitchell
and Forbes fight for their position
as he ran and passed the thirds to a
near touchdown before one of his
passes was intercepted. Parsons, an
other left half, gives Shipkey quite
an imposing array of ball packers
irom the tailback spot when the
team shifts right. Right halves
Troup and Bob Koch also looked
good.
Yesterday the first team lined up
as follows: Jim Ellis and Bill Nourse,
ends; Jean LaMour and Bill Josslyn,
tackles; Kelly Ross and Dick Ab
laras, guards; Loren LaPrade. cen
ter; Jack Reynolds, quarter, Mitchell
and Troup, halves; and Fawcett, full.
