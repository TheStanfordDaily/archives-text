CORVALLIS. Ore., Sept. 26 (UP).
Coach Lon Stiner today named his
starting Oregon State eleven against
Idaho University Saturday and said
only a light workout will be held to
morrow. The right half post will be
the only one not filled by a 1939
veteran. Gene Gray, one of the
squad's fastest men, will start at the
half spot.
