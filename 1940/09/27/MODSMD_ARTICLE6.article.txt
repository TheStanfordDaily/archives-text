TOKYO, Friday, Sept. 27 (UP).â€”
The Japanese press chonased indig
nation today over the new United
States embargo on scrap iron and
steel and the ixifluential newspaper
Asahi went so far as to say "a clash
between Japan . . . and Amex-ica . . .
now seems inevitable."
Asahi said:
"A clash between Japan, which
must proceed with the establish
ment of autonomy for East Asia,
including the South Sea regions,
and America, which is bent upon
interfering with Japan, now seems
inevitable."
The newspaper said that Px-esidcnt
Roosevelt's action in embargoing
scrap irorx, of which Japan was the
heaviest buyer, was motivated by
nervousness over the situation in
Indo-China and was aimed to aug
xnent Japan's difficulties in hostilities
with China, thereby impeding
Japan's southward policy. Asahi
added that Japan was fully prepared
against American economic pxes
sure.
BURMA ROAD QUESTION
The newspaper Yomiuri said that
Japan must be watchful of British
action concerning the now closed
Burma route to China because of the
possibility of a decision to reopen
the route after consulting the
United States.
So engrossed with the American
action were the veiTiacular newspa
pers that they gave only brief men
tion in news columns to the sensa
tional Dakar setback suffcxed by
Britain.
