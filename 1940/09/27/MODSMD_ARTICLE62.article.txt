JERSEY CITY. N.J., Sept. 2(i (UP). —Former champion Maxie liner
blasted liie championship hopes of young Pal Comiskey tonight by scoring I
a technical knockout over him at 2:39 of the first round in their scheduled |
15-round contenders' battle at Roosevelt Stadium.
Referee Jack Dempsey stopped the bout when the 19-year-old Irish- !

man from Paterson, N.J., was being,
beaten unmercifully on the ropes.
He had been floored for the count of
two, arisen and then fallen to one
knee for the count of eight.
Although Comiskey Suffered this
second defeat of his career in only
2 minutes and 39 seconds, during
that brief perior of brawling, he
treated some 25,000 fans to more
thrills than one usually sees in an
entire bout. And his defeat was no
disgrace.
Comiskey started after 31-year
old Baer at the opening gong, bolt
ing Maxie back on his heels with a
barrage of jolting left jabs 1o the
head. He continued to pursue him
until suddenly Maxie caught him
with a hard left hook to the head
and forced Pat into his own corner,

walloping him with staggering hooks I
to the head.
Comiskey escaped,/ from this pre- j
dicament and immediately battered j
Maxie into a neutral corner. The i
crowd was screaming, "Pat's got !
him now! Baer is out!"
But Baer wasn't out. He emerged '
from this barrage wtih a mocking
snarl on his face and suddenly
smashed his taller, younger oppo
nent with a looping overhand right
to the chin.
