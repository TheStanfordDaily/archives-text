# 'All Those Opposed"

### 
DR. WILBUR said yesterday that America was
a nation of minorities. It was founded by
minorities, including religious and political refu
gees whose ideas did not coincide with the dom
inant forces of their original homelands, and it
has always accorded the smaller in number
equal privileges with the more powerful.
In a time of national stress when every effort
of government is turned toward evolving a de
fensive scheme that will keep inviolate the vir
tues of a democratic system, it is easy to become
so preoccupied with protecting these virtues
from foreign encroachment that they are, un
wittingly, destroyed from within. If we are to
fight to protect democracy, we must strive
equally sincerely to retain its spirit within the
nation that boasts of its heritage.
One such certain check against the unwieldy
hulk of militarism that can crush a democratic
way of life is the existence of minority groups.
And these minorities, always alive, always act
ing as a critical balance to the too-hasty move
and the ill-advised decision, can sustain the es
sential guarantees that have, for centuries, been
a part of our life.
Raymond Clapper wrote recently that "the
American people can give up a good many
things in the interest of national defense but if
they give up the right to discuss their own
affairs then they have surrendered completely
to the thing they are supposed to be arming
against. That would not be national defense. It
would be national surrender." Minorities are a
healthy American institution.
