... so you're going to the football game.
Tomorrow when the red-jerseyed Stanford
varsity unlimbers in its opening game of the
1940 gridiron season, 60,000 fans in jam-packed
Kezar Stadium will see the answer to the West
Coast's current football guestion unfold beneath
them as the Indians tune up their revamped
version of the Big Red Machine.
And to more than 57,000 fans at Kezar it will
be just another college gridiron scrap. They'll
be there to see the Indians play, but in the main
their greatest interest will lie in watching the
type of football the Shaughnessy-coached men
have to offer.
But there will be 2,400-odd members of that
gallery to whom this game will mean a great
deal more. The grimy, sweating, red-shirted
men on the green turf of Kezar Stadium and the
watching coach in the center of the Stanford
bench will be more than mere figures that have
provided another afternoon's entertainment.
These 2,400 fans will compose the Stanford
rooting section. That section will be you.
To that white-shirted, red-and-white-hatted,
pompon-waving group in the center of the sta
dium, the men who are the modernized Big Red
Machine will be friend and roommate, neighbor
and coke-time pal. The watching figure on the
team bench will be Clark Shaughnessy . . . our
coach.
Tomorrow the magic wand of fortune may
point toward that team and that coach to send
them on their way toward a winning football
season. The intangible thread of a winning
spirit is strong.
But the thread of this spirit, a power that will
not be downed despite bad breaks and ill for
tune on the gridiron, does not lie in the hands
of the varsity. Nor does it lie on the bench in
the hands of the coach who has moulded the
team.
It lies instead within the rooting section.

Last night, at the first game rally of the year,
that spirit was in thunderous evidence. A howl
ing crowd in Men's Gym showed that the root
ing section would have the stuff.
There is another sort of stuff that Stanford
rooters always have. The stuff of which fine
fellowship and true sportsmanship is made. Sta
dium courtesy is a tricky term, but the Cardinals
have never been puzzled over the definition.
The jeers and catcalls of high-schoolish minds
are noticeably absent in a Farm cheering sec
tion.
Tomorrow Head Yell Leader Gordy Nicoll and
assistants Joe Messina and Chuck Van Deusen
will set the tempo for the cheers of Cardinal fol
lowers. The rooting section will play the tune
for the Big Red Machine to follow.
That tune has been strong throughout the
years of Stanford football history. In good years
and in bad the rooting section has kept up the
beat. Especially noticeable was last year's
U.S.C. game rooting section, from which the
Stanford rooters gained praise even in defeat.
Last spring Clark Shaughnessy took to the
stage of Memorial Hall in his first appearance
on the Farm to be greeted with a roaring brand
of applause that kept the hall in tumult.
Tomorrow Coach Shaughnessy takes to the
field with his Stanford varsity for the first time.
Give him the same kind of support. It will pay
dividends.—W. C.

rooters always have. The stuff of which fine
fellowship and true sportsmanship is made. Sta
dium courtesy is a tricky term, but the Cardinals
have never been puzzled over the definition.
The jeers and catcalls of high-schoolish minds
are noticeably absent in a Farm cheering sec
tion.
Tomorrow Head Yell Leader Gordy Nicoll and
assistants Joe Messina and Chuck Van Deusen
will set the tempo for the cheers of Cardinal fol
lowers. The rooting section will play the tune
for the Big Red Machine to follow.
That tune has been strong throughout the
years of Stanford football history. In good years
and in bad the rooting section has kept up the
beat. Especially noticeable was last year's
U.S.C. game rooting section, from which the
Stanford rooters gained praise even in defeat.
Last spring Clark Shaughnessy took to the
stage of Memorial Hall in his first appearance
on the Farm to be greeted with a roaring brand
of applause that kept the hall in tumult.
Tomorrow Coach Shaughnessy takes to the
field with his Stanford varsity for the first time.
Give him the same kind of support. It will pay
dividends.—W. C.
... so you're going to the football game.
Tomorrow when the red-jerseyed Stanford
varsity unlimbers in its opening game of the
1940 gridiron season, 60,000 fans in jam-packed
Kezar Stadium will see the answer to the West
Coast's current football guestion unfold beneath
them as the Indians tune up their revamped
version of the Big Red Machine.
And to more than 57,000 fans at Kezar it will
be just another college gridiron scrap. They'll
be there to see the Indians play, but in the main
their greatest interest will lie in watching the
type of football the Shaughnessy-coached men
have to offer.
But there will be 2,400-odd members of that
gallery to whom this game will mean a great
deal more. The grimy, sweating, red-shirted
men on the green turf of Kezar Stadium and the
watching coach in the center of the Stanford
bench will be more than mere figures that have
provided another afternoon's entertainment.
These 2,400 fans will compose the Stanford
rooting section. That section will be you.
To that white-shirted, red-and-white-hatted,
pompon-waving group in the center of the sta
dium, the men who are the modernized Big Red
Machine will be friend and roommate, neighbor
and coke-time pal. The watching figure on the
team bench will be Clark Shaughnessy . . . our
coach.
Tomorrow the magic wand of fortune may
point toward that team and that coach to send
them on their way toward a winning football
season. The intangible thread of a winning
spirit is strong.
But the thread of this spirit, a power that will
not be downed despite bad breaks and ill for
tune on the gridiron, does not lie in the hands
of the varsity. Nor does it lie on the bench in
the hands of the coach who has moulded the
team.
It lies instead within the rooting section.

Last night, at the first game rally of the year,
that spirit was in thunderous evidence. A howl
ing crowd in Men's Gym showed that the root
ing section would have the stuff.
There is another sort of stuff that Stanford
rooters always have. The stuff of which fine
fellowship and true sportsmanship is made. Sta
dium courtesy is a tricky term, but the Cardinals
