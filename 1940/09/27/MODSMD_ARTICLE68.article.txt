IT takes a lot of cars to transport a Stanford
rooting section to San Francisco.
And several things might happen along the
way, and on the return jaunt. There are inter
sections, and stop signs, and other automobiles,
not to mention the wonderfully unpredictable
human beings who pilot them.
So, on the way to the City and back tomorrow,
take it easy. Drive sanely. Give the other fellow
a break. Obey the cossacks who'll be on the
highways. Above all remember that the Farm
is a good place to come back to.
Stanford's student leaders and administrators
have just finished welcoming all four thousand
of us—it would be a shame to waste that wel
come, not to mention the $130 tuition check.
It would make a swell down payment on a
casket.
