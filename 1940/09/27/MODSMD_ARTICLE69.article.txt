### BUD AMES 
LAUGH, CLOWN. LAUGH
LAST has been invented a way to get rich rap
idly and with the absolute minimum of effort. In
fact, all you need is one of those little 25-cent rubber
stamp sets that you can buy at the five-and-dime
store. If you need capital in a hurry in order to get
married, or buy a horse ranch, or anything equally
important, here is the answer to your prayer.
The whole affair works on a kind of a chain letter
basis, only the thousands of middle men have been
eliminated. You can't get in trouble with the govern
ment because there is nothing to mail. All you have
to do is to print, let us say for example, a thousand
copies of the little poem below. A single copy of it
has been circulating around the Journalism Corner
for the past couple of days, and never once has there
been a complaint. The poem goes:
This is your receipt for your contribution
To a fund to buy a saddle
To ride Hitler's out of Europe.
Now don't be an ass, and whine.
Just get your dime the way I got mine.
Just ask an acquaintance, "Say, have you got a
dime?" just like you were asking for change. When
he hands you the dime, just give him a printed copy,
and walk away. We've seen it work fifteen times,
with never a backfire. After distributing the thousand
copies, you will have $100.

'JTHIS whole affair appears to be trivial and extremely
superficial. It really isn't. It expresses the attitude
of the average Stanford student for what is going on in
the chaotic world outside the bounds of the Farm.
Just as a student said yesterday over a coke, "Stan
ford students never seem to give a damn about what
goes on. unless it goes on at Stanford. Everything is
just a big joke."
He is right.
Fifth columnists? Oh, sure; we know. Hitler?
Yeah, yeah, we know. That is usually about as far as
it goes. Much better to make up a little poem about
Hitler, or about Stalin, or about killing babies, and
then peddle it off on every Tom, Dick, and Harry. It's
all a big joke.
* * * *
|JNFORTUNATELY things have passed the funny
stage. Have you read the paper lately? Not the
funnies, and the sport page all about Norm Standlee
and Frankie Albert. How about the front, page? You
may not know it. but little muscle-bound Japan is
verging on an alliance with the Axis powers. It is
about time we all began to think about the war moves
which are going on in our front yard, the Pacific.
Japan is closer, 3000 miles closer than Germany.
Maybe you don't think Japan worth worrying, even
thinking, about? A close friend's father is a Navy
officer stationed at Mare Island. Today that island is
a madhouse of preparation. And. says this father, they
aren't preparing the ships to go to Europe.
Maybe we can make up another little poem, only
this time fit the name Japan into it. It ought to sell
like hotcakes. and we'll a big laugh out of it.

copies of the little poem below. A single copy of it
has been circulating around the Journalism Corner
for the past couple of days, and never once has there
been a complaint. The poem goes:
This is your receipt for your contribution
To a fund to buy a saddle
To ride Hitler's out of Europe.
Now don't be an ass, and whine.
Just get your dime the way I got mine.
Just ask an acquaintance, "Say, have you got a
dime?" just like you were asking for change. When
he hands you the dime, just give him a printed copy,
and walk away. We've seen it work fifteen times,
with never a backfire. After distributing the thousand
copies, you will have $100.

'JTHIS whole affair appears to be trivial and extremely
superficial. It really isn't. It expresses the attitude
of the average Stanford student for what is going on in
the chaotic world outside the bounds of the Farm.
Just as a student said yesterday over a coke, "Stan
ford students never seem to give a damn about what
goes on. unless it goes on at Stanford. Everything is
just a big joke."
He is right.
Fifth columnists? Oh, sure; we know. Hitler?
Yeah, yeah, we know. That is usually about as far as
it goes. Much better to make up a little poem about
Hitler, or about Stalin, or about killing babies, and
then peddle it off on every Tom, Dick, and Harry. It's
all a big joke.

|JNFORTUNATELY things have passed the funny
stage. Have you read the paper lately? Not the
funnies, and the sport page all about Norm Standlee
and Frankie Albert. How about the front, page? You
may not know it. but little muscle-bound Japan is
verging on an alliance with the Axis powers. It is
about time we all began to think about the war moves
which are going on in our front yard, the Pacific.
Japan is closer, 3000 miles closer than Germany.
Maybe you don't think Japan worth worrying, even
thinking, about? A close friend's father is a Navy
officer stationed at Mare Island. Today that island is
a madhouse of preparation. And. says this father, they
aren't preparing the ships to go to Europe.
Maybe we can make up another little poem, only
this time fit the name Japan into it. It ought to sell
like hotcakes. and we'll a big laugh out of it.
LAUGH, CLOWN. LAUGH
LAST has been invented a way to get rich rap
idly and with the absolute minimum of effort. In
fact, all you need is one of those little 25-cent rubber
stamp sets that you can buy at the five-and-dime
store. If you need capital in a hurry in order to get
married, or buy a horse ranch, or anything equally
important, here is the answer to your prayer.
The whole affair works on a kind of a chain letter
basis, only the thousands of middle men have been
eliminated. You can't get in trouble with the govern
ment because there is nothing to mail. All you have
to do is to print, let us say for example, a thousand
copies of the little poem below. A single copy of it
has been circulating around the Journalism Corner
for the past couple of days, and never once has there
