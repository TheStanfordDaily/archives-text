SHANGHAI, Friday, Sept. 27 (UP).
—Strikes and violence spread in the
international settlement today and
occidental authorities feared a crisis
which might culminate in a Japa
nese move to seize control of the
French concession and most of the
international settlement.
Police investigating the strikes
charged they were fomented by
Japanese agents, perhaps to enable
the Japanese to seize control under
the pretense of "restoring order."
WORKERS THREATENED
Bus and streetcar employes have
been out several days. The strike
was extended to municipal garbage
collection employes today, presenting
the city with a disease threat.
Utilities company directors, in
sisting on remaining anonymous for
fear of retaliation, said agitators
were threatening the families of
workers unless the employes of gas,
electric power and water works
, plants struck this week-end. Japa
nese newspapers said that taxicab
drivers would join the strike soon.
These same papers hinted that
! United States Marines would be
withdrawn soon "because the force
i was too small to preserve order."
