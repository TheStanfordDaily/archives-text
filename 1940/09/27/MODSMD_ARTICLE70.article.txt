'T'HE EDITOR. SIR:
Upon reading The Daily this morning, I whs both
surprised and disgusted with the column, Bull Ses
sion. This column was devoted to the stupidity of
Southern California athletics and used John Stone
breaker as an example. Having known John well for
several years and having livt>d with him in Coalinga
this summer, I feel fully qualified to deny both the
actions and the language attributed to him.
John Stoncbreaker is a highly intelligent young
man of sound morals and high ideals. Mr. Ames' witti
cisms were given in very poor taste, probably as a
result of jealousy or his own self-consciousness. I be
lieve that it would only be fair for The Daily to issue
an immediate apology in its columns.
