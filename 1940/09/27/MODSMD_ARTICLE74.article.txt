# 'No-Plot' Comedy Graced By Improbable Situations
## 
### 
"IIE STAYED FOR BREAKFAST," with Lorctta Young and Mclvin
Douglas, now playing at the Stanford Theater.
This pleasant little bedroom farce is just one more proof that it is pos
sible to make a complete motion picture with practically no plot at all.
But with anything as decorative as Lorctta Young in the cast the matter

,of plots becomes almost super
fluous.
A series of somewhat improbable I
situations, which does service as the !
story, concerns efforts of Miss Young
to bag a stray Communist organizer
who hides in her apartment. From
the very first glimpse of the luscious
Young no one could seriously ex
pect her to fail.
It all starts when Melvin Douglas, I
the communist, registers his annoy- j
ance at the bourgeois table manners
of Eugene Pallette by shooting his |
coffee cup out of his hand. Pursued !
by the police as an assassin, he hap
pens (anything can happen in Holly
wood) to take refuge in the apart
ment of Loretta Young, who also j
happens to be the estranged wife
of Pallette, a wealthy banker.
SITUATION COMPLICATED
Apparently just to add a bit more
complication Alan Marshal is com
peting ivith Pallette for the affec
tions of Miss Young. And when
Douglas appears the situation be
comes such that it is adequately
summed up by Pallette's remark,
"It's getting so a husband doesn't
know whom to shoot any more."
Since neither Douglas nor Miss
Young care to have the communist
arrested, he stays in her apartment
not only for breakfast, but also for a
couple of days. During this time the
would-be revolutionist learns that
society is divided logically not into
bourgeois and proletariat, but into
male and female. This is due en
tirely to the influence of Miss Young
and a couple of good steaks.
SHOW IS AMUSING
Despite the tenuous plot and gen
eral improbability, the show is
amusing in a frothy way. Relying on
situations for humor, the director,
Alexander Hall, has made the most
of each scene. And the actors, all
dependable troupers, turn in nicely
styled performances.
On the small end of the double bill
is "Mystery Sea Raider," in which
a pack of ruffians with thick German
accents kidnap Carol Landis, 295
other people, and a reconditioned
tub. But the Briitllh navy comes
over the horizon at the right mo
ment. â€” Douglass
