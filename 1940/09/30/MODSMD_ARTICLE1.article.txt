r | I HE totalitarian states have at last
demonstrated openly that they
will use against the United States the
same methods of intimidation and
trickery that they have been using
against European peoples for several
years. By signing a pact, Germany,
Italy, and Japan think they can
force the American 1 people to back
down in their aid to Great Britain.
Examination of the predicament in
which Japan finds herself reveals
that she cannot possibly benefit ma
terially by the agreement; she is iso
lated from her new allies. Obviously,
the signing of the pact was what we
Americans know as a publicity stunt.
* ♦ *
When Berlin proclaimed last week
that a "document of historical im
portance" had been signed, the Ger
man propagandists didn't immediate
ly release the contents of the paper.
Instead they, as highly efficient prop
agandists, waited a day so that the
world's attention would be focused
where they wished—on Berlin. Then
while observers all over the free
world were busy guessing just what
the Germans would spring, the tri
party pact was made public. Ob
viously, it was intended primarily
for the American leading public.
Gist of the pact is contained in the
following paragraph:
# # *
ii/ 1 ERMANY, Italy, and Japan
agree to collaborate in their
efforts at the creation of a new or
der in Europe and the great Asiatic
realm and mutually support each
other with all and any economic,
political, and military means should
they be attacked by any power not
at present involved in the Eu
ropean or the Chinese-Japanese
war."
Americans are supposed to read
this. The United States is the only
great power not involved in either
of the two wars mentioned. Fur
thermore, the United States has
shown lately in more drastic fashion
her determination to uphold the
status quo in the Far East—to pre
vent the creation of a new order in
Asia.
* * *
The United States has shown
where she stands first by extending
through the Export-Import Bank a
new loan to strengthen China's re
sistance and then by cutting off all
shipments of scrap-iron to Japan.
At the same time, rumors were per
mitted to circulate in Washington
that the United States would secure
from Britain the use of her naval
base at Singapore. Britain, there
upon, offered these facilities to the
American fleet.
Japan is on the spot—not the
l nited States as some of us have
been lead to believe.
* * *
According to one leading naval
ant 1 in y, Rear Admiral Yates
iiiig, Jr.:
"Japan must know that the
American fleet, by utilizing the
great naval base at Singapore, and
operating offensively from the
British territorial possessions and
her own Philippines, would be
capable of waging a disastrous war
on Japan's vital sea communica
tions, thus crippling Japan's eco
nomic security in the Orient and
defeating the Japanese armies in
China."

r | I PIUS, Japan finds herself in a
more perplexing situation every
clay. Perhaps it is little wonder that
Japan has signed a piece of paper
with Germany and Italy; but even a
piece of paper signed by such pow
ers can be little avail to a Japan so
far isolated from her allies.
Late last night word came from
Washington that closer co-opera
tion among the 21 American coun
tries was anticipated as an answer
to the new tri-party agreement. So
while the United States stands firm
in the Far East, she will offer a re
ply to the totalitarian intimidation
pact that can have teeth.
It is physically possible for Amer
ican countries to aid each other; it
is bluff when Germany and Italy
say they will help Japan.
