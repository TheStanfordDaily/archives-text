# Distribution Not Shortage Is Europe's Food Problem
## Farm Research Institute Releases Findings on World Wheat Situation 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Whether or not the Cierman-dominatcd countries of Europe will starve
this winter depends more on Nazi distribution of available wheat supplies
than on the reserve stocks available, according to a report released yes
terday by the Stanford Food Research Institute.
The survey of the current and prospective wheat supplies of European

belligerents mvd non-belligerent na- 4
tions was compiled by Drs. Helen C.
Farnsworth and V. P. Timoshenko.
It predicts:
1. "Reasonably adequate" gross
food supplies (including wheat)
this year in Greater Germany and
Italy.
2. Possibility of persisting food
shortage in cities of Germanized
Poland.
DISTRIBUTION DIFFICULTIES
3. Perhaps adequate supplies for
France, as a whole, but probable dif
culties of food distribution because
of the artificial division of the coun
try, disruption of normal transport
and trade, and concentration of ref
ugees in the unoccupied areas.
4. Definite threat of "quantitative
as well as qualitative deficiencies in
food if the present blockade contin
ues well into 1941" in the German
controlled northwestern countries —
The Netherlands, Belgium, Den
mark, and Norway. Belgium's posi
tion "seems potentially the most
critical," and Holland's is next.
5. Only "Qualitative reduction in
the British diet" so long as Britain
can maintain the flow of shipping
and can prevent her domestic econ
omy from "being shattered."
CROP SHORTAGE
Lack of official crop estimates
from many of the European coun
tries have forced Economists Farns
worth and Timoshenko to work
partly in the dark, but they point
out that on the Continent, outside of
the Soviet Union, wheat and bread
grain supplies are considerably
smaller than in either of the two
preceding years.
They conclude that total wheat
supplies are perhaps 120 million
bushels smaller than last year, and
130 million smaller than the year
before. However, with these sup
plies, and with imports of 15-25 mil
lion bushels from the Danube basin,
it. would be theoretically possible, in
the absence of other imports, to
maintain normal seed use of wheat
and a rationed level of food and feed
consumption reduced by only about
10 per cent from the level of
]V>39-40.
DEPENDS ON GERMANY
This, obviously, would not mean
critical food shortage, but it would
depend largely on Germany's will
ingness to use most of her large
wheat stocks, or to divert rye, pota
toes, and other foods to the food
deficient countries under her control.
In the cases of Denmark, Belgium,
and The Netherlands, under the
blockade, a food shortage is defi
nitely threatened unless Germany
devises measures to prevent it. "Bel
gium and The Netherlands," Drs.
Farnsworth and Timoshenko de
clare, "seem to be in the worst con
dition because of their heavy de
pendence on imports. Of these two,
Belgium evidently faces the greater
shortage. She had apparently used
alt her available surplus wheat
tsocks by August 1, and had even
drawn on normal year-end and
working reserves."
BELGIUM WORST
Allowing for the new crop, and a
10 per cent reduction ip consump
tion, the economists judge that Bel
gium's wheat-import deficit for
1940-41 will be approximately 70
per cent. Conditions in regard to
general food and feed will be even
worse than that of the wheat be
cause Belgium is normally depend
ent upon foreign countries for sub
stantial imports of rye, toarse grains,
and even potatoes.
The situation is considered slightly
less critical for the Dutch because
they apparently held substantial
year-end reserves of wheat on Aug
ust 1, 1940. They are normally de
pendent on foreign countries for
only wheat and feed supplies, and
they normally produce a substantial
surplus of potatoes.
LIVESTOCK VITAL
If the Danish farmers can be kept
from feeding wheat and rye to their
livestock, if the normal surplus of
potatoes is available and can be
largely diverted to human consump
tion, if the expected increased sup
ply of meat from slaughtered live
stock is made available (and not
transferred to Germany except in
exchange for other foodstuffs), no
critical food shortage should de
velop.
Both Holland and Belgium, like
Denmark, are dairying countries
and can resort to the slaughtering of
livestock. But it is expected that
the farmers will resist such a move
strongly and, "unless forcibly pre
vented, they may even attempt to
feed grain and potatoes that should,
in the national interest, be reserved
for food use."
BRITISH SURPLUS
The British Isles, it is noted, had
unprecedentedly large old - crop
stocks of wheat on hand on August
1, and a good sized harvest, so that
they started the crop year (August
1940-July 1941) with wheat sup
plies of record size.
Canada's exportable surplus for
1940-41 is now placed at a peak fig
ure of 675 million bushels—enough
to fill the normal bread and wheat
food requirements of the United
Kingdom for two years without, the
use of British or other foreign
wheat. Thus, Britain, which must
always depend on imports for a

large portion of her need, is more
than adequately supplied as long as
she Gan control the shipping lanes.
Drp. Farnsworth and Timosbenko's
survey shows that the four major
exporting nations — Canada, the
United States, Argentina, and Aus
tralia—will have the largest export
able supplies of wheat in history to
meet import demands which are
likely to be the smallest in recent
years. This is due, of course, to war
and blockade restrictions.

In the cases of Denmark, Belgium,
and The Netherlands, under the
blockade, a food shortage is defi
nitely threatened unless Germany
devises measures to prevent it. "Bel
gium and The Netherlands," Drs.
Farnsworth and Timoshenko de
clare, "seem to be in the worst con
dition because of their heavy de
pendence on imports. Of these two,
Belgium evidently faces the greater
shortage. She had apparently used
alt her available surplus wheat
tsocks by August 1, and had even
drawn on normal year-end and
working reserves."
BELGIUM WORST
Allowing for the new crop, and a
10 per cent reduction ip consump
tion, the economists judge that Bel
gium's wheat-import deficit for
1940-41 will be approximately 70
per cent. Conditions in regard to
general food and feed will be even
worse than that of the wheat be
cause Belgium is normally depend
ent upon foreign countries for sub
stantial imports of rye, toarse grains,
and even potatoes.
The situation is considered slightly
less critical for the Dutch because
they apparently held substantial
year-end reserves of wheat on Aug
ust 1, 1940. They are normally de
pendent on foreign countries for
only wheat and feed supplies, and
they normally produce a substantial
surplus of potatoes.
LIVESTOCK VITAL
If the Danish farmers can be kept
from feeding wheat and rye to their
livestock, if the normal surplus of
potatoes is available and can be
largely diverted to human consump
tion, if the expected increased sup
ply of meat from slaughtered live
stock is made available (and not
transferred to Germany except in
exchange for other foodstuffs), no
critical food shortage should de
velop.
Both Holland and Belgium, like
Denmark, are dairying countries
and can resort to the slaughtering of
livestock. But it is expected that
the farmers will resist such a move
strongly and, "unless forcibly pre
vented, they may even attempt to
feed grain and potatoes that should,
in the national interest, be reserved
for food use."
BRITISH SURPLUS
The British Isles, it is noted, had
unprecedentedly large old - crop
stocks of wheat on hand on August
1, and a good sized harvest, so that
they started the crop year (August
1940-July 1941) with wheat sup
plies of record size.
Canada's exportable surplus for
1940-41 is now placed at a peak fig
ure of 675 million bushels—enough
to fill the normal bread and wheat
food requirements of the United
Kingdom for two years without, the
use of British or other foreign
wheat. Thus, Britain, which must
always depend on imports for a

large portion of her need, is more
than adequately supplied as long as
she Gan control the shipping lanes.
Drp. Farnsworth and Timosbenko's
survey shows that the four major
exporting nations — Canada, the
United States, Argentina, and Aus
tralia—will have the largest export
able supplies of wheat in history to
meet import demands which are
likely to be the smallest in recent
years. This is due, of course, to war
and blockade restrictions.
Whether or not the Cierman-dominatcd countries of Europe will starve
this winter depends more on Nazi distribution of available wheat supplies
than on the reserve stocks available, according to a report released yes
terday by the Stanford Food Research Institute.
The survey of the current and prospective wheat supplies of European

belligerents mvd non-belligerent na- 4
tions was compiled by Drs. Helen C.
Farnsworth and V. P. Timoshenko.
It predicts:
1. "Reasonably adequate" gross
food supplies (including wheat)
this year in Greater Germany and
Italy.
2. Possibility of persisting food
shortage in cities of Germanized
Poland.
DISTRIBUTION DIFFICULTIES
3. Perhaps adequate supplies for
France, as a whole, but probable dif
culties of food distribution because
of the artificial division of the coun
try, disruption of normal transport
and trade, and concentration of ref
ugees in the unoccupied areas.
4. Definite threat of "quantitative
as well as qualitative deficiencies in
food if the present blockade contin
ues well into 1941" in the German
controlled northwestern countries —
The Netherlands, Belgium, Den
mark, and Norway. Belgium's posi
tion "seems potentially the most
critical," and Holland's is next.
5. Only "Qualitative reduction in
the British diet" so long as Britain
can maintain the flow of shipping
and can prevent her domestic econ
omy from "being shattered."
CROP SHORTAGE
Lack of official crop estimates
from many of the European coun
tries have forced Economists Farns
worth and Timoshenko to work
partly in the dark, but they point
out that on the Continent, outside of
the Soviet Union, wheat and bread
grain supplies are considerably
smaller than in either of the two
preceding years.
They conclude that total wheat
supplies are perhaps 120 million
bushels smaller than last year, and
130 million smaller than the year
before. However, with these sup
plies, and with imports of 15-25 mil
lion bushels from the Danube basin,
it. would be theoretically possible, in
the absence of other imports, to
maintain normal seed use of wheat
and a rationed level of food and feed
consumption reduced by only about
10 per cent from the level of
]V>39-40.

This, obviously, would not mean

wheat. Thus, Britain, which must
always depend on imports for a

large portion of her need, is more
than adequately supplied as long as
she Gan control the shipping lanes.
Drp. Farnsworth and Timosbenko's
survey shows that the four major
exporting nations — Canada, the
United States, Argentina, and Aus
tralia—will have the largest export
able supplies of wheat in history to
meet import demands which are
likely to be the smallest in recent
years. This is due, of course, to war
and blockade restrictions.
Whether or not the Cierman-dominatcd countries of Europe will starve
this winter depends more on Nazi distribution of available wheat supplies
than on the reserve stocks available, according to a report released yes
terday by the Stanford Food Research Institute.
The survey of the current and prospective wheat supplies of European

belligerents mvd non-belligerent na- 4
tions was compiled by Drs. Helen C.
Farnsworth and V. P. Timoshenko.
It predicts:
1. "Reasonably adequate" gross
food supplies (including wheat)
this year in Greater Germany and
Italy.
2. Possibility of persisting food
shortage in cities of Germanized
Poland.
DISTRIBUTION DIFFICULTIES
3. Perhaps adequate supplies for
France, as a whole, but probable dif
culties of food distribution because
of the artificial division of the coun
try, disruption of normal transport
and trade, and concentration of ref
ugees in the unoccupied areas.
4. Definite threat of "quantitative
as well as qualitative deficiencies in
food if the present blockade contin
ues well into 1941" in the German
controlled northwestern countries —
The Netherlands, Belgium, Den
mark, and Norway. Belgium's posi
tion "seems potentially the most
critical," and Holland's is next.
5. Only "Qualitative reduction in
the British diet" so long as Britain
can maintain the flow of shipping
and can prevent her domestic econ
omy from "being shattered."
CROP SHORTAGE
Lack of official crop estimates
from many of the European coun
tries have forced Economists Farns
worth and Timoshenko to work
partly in the dark, but they point
out that on the Continent, outside of
the Soviet Union, wheat and bread
grain supplies are considerably
smaller than in either of the two
preceding years.
They conclude that total wheat
supplies are perhaps 120 million
bushels smaller than last year, and
130 million smaller than the year
before. However, with these sup
plies, and with imports of 15-25 mil
lion bushels from the Danube basin,
it. would be theoretically possible, in
the absence of other imports, to
maintain normal seed use of wheat
and a rationed level of food and feed
consumption reduced by only about
10 per cent from the level of
]V>39-40.
DEPENDS ON GERMANY
This, obviously, would not mean
critical food shortage, but it would
depend largely on Germany's will
ingness to use most of her large
wheat stocks, or to divert rye, pota
toes, and other foods to the food
deficient countries under her control.
In the cases of Denmark, Belgium,
and The Netherlands, under the
blockade, a food shortage is defi
nitely threatened unless Germany
devises measures to prevent it. "Bel
gium and The Netherlands," Drs.
Farnsworth and Timoshenko de
clare, "seem to be in the worst con
dition because of their heavy de
pendence on imports. Of these two,
Belgium evidently faces the greater
shortage. She had apparently used
alt her available surplus wheat
tsocks by August 1, and had even
drawn on normal year-end and
working reserves."
BELGIUM WORST
Allowing for the new crop, and a
10 per cent reduction ip consump
tion, the economists judge that Bel
gium's wheat-import deficit for
1940-41 will be approximately 70
per cent. Conditions in regard to
general food and feed will be even
worse than that of the wheat be
cause Belgium is normally depend
ent upon foreign countries for sub
stantial imports of rye, toarse grains,
and even potatoes.
The situation is considered slightly
less critical for the Dutch because
they apparently held substantial
year-end reserves of wheat on Aug
ust 1, 1940. They are normally de
pendent on foreign countries for
only wheat and feed supplies, and
they normally produce a substantial
surplus of potatoes.
LIVESTOCK VITAL
If the Danish farmers can be kept
from feeding wheat and rye to their
livestock, if the normal surplus of
potatoes is available and can be
largely diverted to human consump
tion, if the expected increased sup
ply of meat from slaughtered live
stock is made available (and not
transferred to Germany except in
exchange for other foodstuffs), no
critical food shortage should de
velop.
Both Holland and Belgium, like
Denmark, are dairying countries
and can resort to the slaughtering of
livestock. But it is expected that
the farmers will resist such a move
strongly and, "unless forcibly pre
vented, they may even attempt to
feed grain and potatoes that should,
in the national interest, be reserved
for food use."
BRITISH SURPLUS
The British Isles, it is noted, had
unprecedentedly large old - crop
stocks of wheat on hand on August
1, and a good sized harvest, so that
they started the crop year (August
1940-July 1941) with wheat sup
plies of record size.
Canada's exportable surplus for
1940-41 is now placed at a peak fig
ure of 675 million bushels—enough
to fill the normal bread and wheat
food requirements of the United
Kingdom for two years without, the
use of British or other foreign
wheat. Thus, Britain, which must
always depend on imports for a

maintain normal seed use of wheat
and a rationed level of food and feed
consumption reduced by only about
10 per cent from the level of
]V>39-40.
DEPENDS ON GERMANY
This, obviously, would not mean
critical food shortage, but it would
depend largely on Germany's will
ingness to use most of her large
wheat stocks, or to divert rye, pota
toes, and other foods to the food
deficient countries under her control.
In the cases of Denmark, Belgium,
and The Netherlands, under the
blockade, a food shortage is defi
nitely threatened unless Germany
devises measures to prevent it. "Bel
gium and The Netherlands," Drs.
Farnsworth and Timoshenko de
clare, "seem to be in the worst con
dition because of their heavy de
pendence on imports. Of these two,
Belgium evidently faces the greater
shortage. She had apparently used
alt her available surplus wheat
tsocks by August 1, and had even
drawn on normal year-end and
working reserves."
BELGIUM WORST
Allowing for the new crop, and a
10 per cent reduction ip consump
tion, the economists judge that Bel
gium's wheat-import deficit for
1940-41 will be approximately 70
per cent. Conditions in regard to
general food and feed will be even
worse than that of the wheat be
cause Belgium is normally depend
ent upon foreign countries for sub
stantial imports of rye, toarse grains,
and even potatoes.
The situation is considered slightly
less critical for the Dutch because
they apparently held substantial
year-end reserves of wheat on Aug
ust 1, 1940. They are normally de
pendent on foreign countries for
only wheat and feed supplies, and
they normally produce a substantial
surplus of potatoes.
LIVESTOCK VITAL
If the Danish farmers can be kept
from feeding wheat and rye to their
livestock, if the normal surplus of
potatoes is available and can be
largely diverted to human consump
tion, if the expected increased sup
ply of meat from slaughtered live
stock is made available (and not
transferred to Germany except in
exchange for other foodstuffs), no
critical food shortage should de
velop.
Both Holland and Belgium, like
Denmark, are dairying countries
and can resort to the slaughtering of
livestock. But it is expected that
the farmers will resist such a move
strongly and, "unless forcibly pre
vented, they may even attempt to
feed grain and potatoes that should,
in the national interest, be reserved
for food use."
BRITISH SURPLUS
The British Isles, it is noted, had
unprecedentedly large old - crop
stocks of wheat on hand on August
1, and a good sized harvest, so that
they started the crop year (August
1940-July 1941) with wheat sup
plies of record size.
Canada's exportable surplus for
1940-41 is now placed at a peak fig
ure of 675 million bushels—enough
to fill the normal bread and wheat
food requirements of the United
Kingdom for two years without, the
use of British or other foreign
wheat. Thus, Britain, which must
always depend on imports for a

large portion of her need, is more
than adequately supplied as long as
she Gan control the shipping lanes.
Drp. Farnsworth and Timosbenko's
survey shows that the four major
exporting nations — Canada, the
United States, Argentina, and Aus
tralia—will have the largest export
able supplies of wheat in history to
meet import demands which are
likely to be the smallest in recent
years. This is due, of course, to war
and blockade restrictions.
