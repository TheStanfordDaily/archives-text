# Distribution Not Shortage Is Europe's Food Problem
## Farm Research Institute Releases Findings on World Wheat Situation 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Whether or not the Cierman-dominatcd countries of Europe will starve
this winter depends more on Nazi distribution of available wheat supplies
than on the reserve stocks available, according to a report released yes
terday by the Stanford Food Research Institute.
The survey of the current and prospective wheat supplies of European

belligerents mvd non-belligerent na- 4
tions was compiled by Drs. Helen C.
Farnsworth and V. P. Timoshenko.
It predicts:
1. "Reasonably adequate" gross
food supplies (including wheat)
this year in Greater Germany and
Italy.
2. Possibility of persisting food
shortage in cities of Germanized
Poland.
DISTRIBUTION DIFFICULTIES
3. Perhaps adequate supplies for
France, as a whole, but probable dif
culties of food distribution because
of the artificial division of the coun
try, disruption of normal transport
and trade, and concentration of ref
ugees in the unoccupied areas.
4. Definite threat of "quantitative
as well as qualitative deficiencies in
food if the present blockade contin
ues well into 1941" in the German
controlled northwestern countries —
The Netherlands, Belgium, Den
mark, and Norway. Belgium's posi
tion "seems potentially the most
critical," and Holland's is next.
5. Only "Qualitative reduction in
the British diet" so long as Britain
can maintain the flow of shipping
and can prevent her domestic econ
omy from "being shattered."
CROP SHORTAGE
Lack of official crop estimates
from many of the European coun
tries have forced Economists Farns
worth and Timoshenko to work
partly in the dark, but they point
out that on the Continent, outside of
the Soviet Union, wheat and bread
grain supplies are considerably
smaller than in either of the two
preceding years.
They conclude that total wheat
supplies are perhaps 120 million
bushels smaller than last year, and
130 million smaller than the year
before. However, with these sup
plies, and with imports of 15-25 mil
lion bushels from the Danube basin,
it. would be theoretically possible, in
the absence of other imports, to
maintain normal seed use of wheat
and a rationed level of food and feed
consumption reduced by only about
10 per cent from the level of
]V>39-40.
DEPENDS ON GERMANY
This, obviously, would not mean
critical food shortage, but it would
depend largely on Germany's will
ingness to use most of her large
wheat stocks, or to divert rye, pota
toes, and other foods to the food
deficient countries under her control.
In the cases of Denmark, Belgium,
