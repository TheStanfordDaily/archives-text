# Indians Romp Over S.F. With New Razzle-Dazzle System In 27-0 Opener
## Untried Sophs Work Smoothly For New Coach 
### CHUCK SMITH 
It didn't seem plausible thai a
coach as unsuccessful as Clark
Shaughnessy had been for the last
few years, and a victor,vlcss hall
club like the Indians of "M and
'39, could combine to produce
winning football. But that was
before last Saturday's game when
the odds were lft-7 against them
and before they bruised and bc
wildered the University of San
Francisco into submission 27-0 in
the season's opener.
There were many of the same ball
players who had struggled for the
past two years with little success,
but few would have recognized them
on performance alone last Satur
day. It was the same Frankie Al
bert at quarterback, but this year
he passed with precision and with
little waste of time. It was the same
Norm Standlee, but this time he
had a line to open holes for him,
giving him a chance to flash his
natural speed; and Norm stretched
his runs from the usual five yardi
on power alone to 20 or 30.
VETERANS SHINE
Pete Kmetovic and Hugh Gallar
neau still had the speed and de
ception they showed in flashes last
season, but this year they are using
their abilities at the right time and
in the riglu section. Stan GralT,
another oldtimer, was given a
chance to show what a pass receiver
he Is, and he speared two of Albert's
tosses to set up the third Card
touchdown.
It was the same Freddie Meyer,
but no longer inconsistent. Fred
was pressing all the time, downing
Don punt returners in their tracks
and rushing the dickens out of their
passers. And the same linemen of
old, Rod Warnecke, Ken Robesky,
Doug Stable, Claude Purkitt, and
John Kerman, looked different with
their new-found drive in tackling
and blocking.
SOPHS WENT
Even more of a revelation than
the renovation of the veterans were
the come-through performances <>f
a number of untried sophomores,
The slogan before Saturday's game
had been, "as the soph linemen go,
so goes the Stanford team." That
score of 27-0 ought to be enough
proof of how they went.
Chuck Taylor and Bruno Ban
ducci looked just, as experienced as
any seniors, submarining on de
fense, opening big gaps in the line
on offense, and worrying the U.S.F,
passers to death. Dick Palmer, line
captain, which is quite a responsi
bility for an untried sophomore,
called the defensive signals with
perfection as well as making a good
share of stops from his line-backing
spot.
EVERYBODY PLAYS
Vic Lindskog showed no signs of
his supposed weakness, passing
from center. Ail his centers to punt
formation were 0.K., and Vic made
plenty of stops as the other line
backer. The outstanding sophomore
backfield man was little Eric "Hoot"
Armstrong. On one of those breath
taking quick opener plays, called on
definite instructions by the master
mind Shaughnessy for Armstrong's
benefit, the little guy scampered *{•'>
yards to the Indians' second score.
So complete was the rout of the
Dons that Shaughnessy was able to
use 42 men, clearing the bench of
all men he thought in condition for
action. Bill Willard, end, and Al
Cole, quarterback, weren't wel
enough to play but are sure to set
action in the future.
True, the team got off to a sput
tering start on their first few of
fensive tries. A bix-up in ball han
dling and several offside penalties
made ihem look like shades of '39
But, instead of continuing their
blunders, they soon found them
selves.
Quarterback Albert soon estab
lished in the Dons' minds the threat
of the distractor by flipping a lat
eral pass to Hugh Gallarneau out
at the sidelines and Hugh threaded
his way 17 yards toward the U.S.F.
goal.
THE CHIEF ROLLS
Albert followed with a couple
more passes deep to Gallarneau,
each a potential touchdown, but
the ball just got away from Hugh on
each try. Now, with the opposition
thoroughly seared and expecting a
wide open attack, he called for
Standlee down the middle.
A wide hole was waiting for Norm
and he rolled 21 yards to the 6 to
set up the first touchdown. That
first score was typical of the
Shaughnessy system. It was the
quick opener through guard and
Pete Kmetovic squirted through
the waiting gap and deep into the
end zone to fall only because of his
own momentum. So split-second
was the timing that a charging line
man had his hands on Albert as he
was reversing to Kmetovic but the
ball was safely away and the Cards
had their first touchdown before
the other Dons knew where the
ball was going.
ONE A QUARTER
That was in the first quarter and
the Indians continued to score a
touchdown a period. Armstrong's
run burst like a bombshell on the
baffled Dons. Albert had just
brought back a U.S.F. punt to the
Don 42. Standlee got 2 yards, and
Milt Vucinich, who replaced the
Chief, got three more. And then
there it was—that same quick dash
through guard with little Eric car
lying this time, and going all the
way.
The third period score was set
up by a 35-yard romp by the fleet
Gallarneau and by one of those pre
cision pitches of Albert to Graff who
was waiting wide open just behind
the Don linebackers on the 6-yard
line. It took Standlee, three tries
before he finally power-dived into
the end zone.
BLOCKERS CONNECT
The fourth and final score was a i
good example of how well Shaugh
nessy has coached his boys on fun
damentals: namely, downfield block
ing. It occurred when Kmetovic
toured back 60 yards with an S.F.
punt. The blocking was really
smooth and substitute guard Jack
Francis, a converted fullback, and
fttfd Warnecke eliminated five Dons
1o finally spring Kmetovic into the
clear just when it seemed he was
trapped.
The fans' conclusion following the
Indians' victorious debut is that
they play spectators' ball and play
it .successfully. Shaughne&sy's sys
tem strikes with surprise and fe
rocity and every play is a potential
score. The formations and the dis
tractor in particular look screwy,
but 35,000 fans agreed last Satur- !
day that there is method in Shaugh
nessy's madness.

wide open attack, he called for
Standlee down the middle.
A wide hole was waiting for Norm
and he rolled 21 yards to the 6 to
set up the first touchdown. That
first score was typical of the
Shaughnessy system. It was the
quick opener through guard and
Pete Kmetovic squirted through
the waiting gap and deep into the
end zone to fall only because of his
own momentum. So split-second
was the timing that a charging line
man had his hands on Albert as he
was reversing to Kmetovic but the
ball was safely away and the Cards
had their first touchdown before
the other Dons knew where the
ball was going.
ONE A QUARTER
That was in the first quarter and
the Indians continued to score a
touchdown a period. Armstrong's
run burst like a bombshell on the
baffled Dons. Albert had just
brought back a U.S.F. punt to the
Don 42. Standlee got 2 yards, and
Milt Vucinich, who replaced the
Chief, got three more. And then
there it was—that same quick dash
through guard with little Eric car
lying this time, and going all the
way.
The third period score was set
up by a 35-yard romp by the fleet
Gallarneau and by one of those pre
cision pitches of Albert to Graff who
was waiting wide open just behind
the Don linebackers on the 6-yard
line. It took Standlee, three tries
before he finally power-dived into
the end zone.
BLOCKERS CONNECT
The fourth and final score was a i
good example of how well Shaugh
nessy has coached his boys on fun
damentals: namely, downfield block
ing. It occurred when Kmetovic
toured back 60 yards with an S.F.
punt. The blocking was really
smooth and substitute guard Jack
Francis, a converted fullback, and
fttfd Warnecke eliminated five Dons
1o finally spring Kmetovic into the
clear just when it seemed he was
trapped.
The fans' conclusion following the
Indians' victorious debut is that
they play spectators' ball and play
it .successfully. Shaughne&sy's sys
tem strikes with surprise and fe
rocity and every play is a potential
score. The formations and the dis
tractor in particular look screwy,
but 35,000 fans agreed last Satur- !
day that there is method in Shaugh
nessy's madness.

descendant of Mordecai Lincoln,

It didn't seem plausible thai a
coach as unsuccessful as Clark
Shaughnessy had been for the last
few years, and a victor,vlcss hall
club like the Indians of "M and
'39, could combine to produce
winning football. But that was
before last Saturday's game when
the odds were lft-7 against them
and before they bruised and bc
wildered the University of San
Francisco into submission 27-0 in
the season's opener.
There were many of the same ball
players who had struggled for the
past two years with little success,
but few would have recognized them
on performance alone last Satur
day. It was the same Frankie Al
bert at quarterback, but this year
he passed with precision and with
little waste of time. It was the same
Norm Standlee, but this time he
had a line to open holes for him,
giving him a chance to flash his
natural speed; and Norm stretched
his runs from the usual five yardi
on power alone to 20 or 30.
VETERANS SHINE
Pete Kmetovic and Hugh Gallar
neau still had the speed and de
ception they showed in flashes last
season, but this year they are using
their abilities at the right time and
in the riglu section. Stan GralT,
another oldtimer, was given a
chance to show what a pass receiver
he Is, and he speared two of Albert's
tosses to set up the third Card
touchdown.
It was the same Freddie Meyer,
but no longer inconsistent. Fred
was pressing all the time, downing
Don punt returners in their tracks
and rushing the dickens out of their
passers. And the same linemen of
old, Rod Warnecke, Ken Robesky,
Doug Stable, Claude Purkitt, and
John Kerman, looked different with
their new-found drive in tackling
and blocking.

the renovation of the veterans were
the come-through performances <>f
a number of untried sophomores,

SOPHS WENT
Even more of a revelation than
the renovation of the veterans were
the come-through performances <>f
a number of untried sophomores,
The slogan before Saturday's game
had been, "as the soph linemen go,
so goes the Stanford team." That
score of 27-0 ought to be enough
proof of how they went.
Chuck Taylor and Bruno Ban
ducci looked just, as experienced as
any seniors, submarining on de
fense, opening big gaps in the line
on offense, and worrying the U.S.F,
passers to death. Dick Palmer, line
captain, which is quite a responsi
bility for an untried sophomore,
called the defensive signals with
perfection as well as making a good
share of stops from his line-backing
spot.
EVERYBODY PLAYS
Vic Lindskog showed no signs of
his supposed weakness, passing
from center. Ail his centers to punt
formation were 0.K., and Vic made
plenty of stops as the other line
backer. The outstanding sophomore
backfield man was little Eric "Hoot"
Armstrong. On one of those breath
taking quick opener plays, called on
definite instructions by the master
mind Shaughnessy for Armstrong's
benefit, the little guy scampered *{•'>
yards to the Indians' second score.
So complete was the rout of the
Dons that Shaughnessy was able to
use 42 men, clearing the bench of
all men he thought in condition for
action. Bill Willard, end, and Al
Cole, quarterback, weren't wel
enough to play but are sure to set
action in the future.
True, the team got off to a sput
tering start on their first few of
fensive tries. A bix-up in ball han
dling and several offside penalties
made ihem look like shades of '39
But, instead of continuing their
blunders, they soon found them
selves.
Quarterback Albert soon estab
lished in the Dons' minds the threat
of the distractor by flipping a lat
eral pass to Hugh Gallarneau out
at the sidelines and Hugh threaded
his way 17 yards toward the U.S.F.
goal.
THE CHIEF ROLLS
Albert followed with a couple
more passes deep to Gallarneau,
each a potential touchdown, but
the ball just got away from Hugh on
each try. Now, with the opposition
thoroughly seared and expecting a
wide open attack, he called for
Standlee down the middle.
A wide hole was waiting for Norm
and he rolled 21 yards to the 6 to
set up the first touchdown. That
first score was typical of the
Shaughnessy system. It was the
quick opener through guard and
Pete Kmetovic squirted through
the waiting gap and deep into the
end zone to fall only because of his
own momentum. So split-second
was the timing that a charging line
man had his hands on Albert as he
was reversing to Kmetovic but the
ball was safely away and the Cards
had their first touchdown before
the other Dons knew where the
ball was going.
ONE A QUARTER
That was in the first quarter and
the Indians continued to score a
touchdown a period. Armstrong's
run burst like a bombshell on the
baffled Dons. Albert had just
brought back a U.S.F. punt to the
Don 42. Standlee got 2 yards, and
Milt Vucinich, who replaced the
Chief, got three more. And then
there it was—that same quick dash
through guard with little Eric car
lying this time, and going all the
way.
The third period score was set
up by a 35-yard romp by the fleet
Gallarneau and by one of those pre
cision pitches of Albert to Graff who
was waiting wide open just behind
the Don linebackers on the 6-yard
line. It took Standlee, three tries
before he finally power-dived into
the end zone.
BLOCKERS CONNECT
The fourth and final score was a i
good example of how well Shaugh
nessy has coached his boys on fun
damentals: namely, downfield block
ing. It occurred when Kmetovic
toured back 60 yards with an S.F.
punt. The blocking was really
smooth and substitute guard Jack
Francis, a converted fullback, and
fttfd Warnecke eliminated five Dons
1o finally spring Kmetovic into the
clear just when it seemed he was
trapped.
The fans' conclusion following the
Indians' victorious debut is that
they play spectators' ball and play
it .successfully. Shaughne&sy's sys
tem strikes with surprise and fe
rocity and every play is a potential
score. The formations and the dis
tractor in particular look screwy,
but 35,000 fans agreed last Satur- !
day that there is method in Shaugh
nessy's madness.
Abraham Lincoln was a direct
descendant of Mordecai Lincoln,
who built a forge at Bound Brook,
Mass., in 1703.
It didn't seem plausible thai a
coach as unsuccessful as Clark
Shaughnessy had been for the last
few years, and a victor,vlcss hall
club like the Indians of "M and
'39, could combine to produce
winning football. But that was
before last Saturday's game when
the odds were lft-7 against them
and before they bruised and bc
wildered the University of San
Francisco into submission 27-0 in
the season's opener.
There were many of the same ball
players who had struggled for the
past two years with little success,
but few would have recognized them
on performance alone last Satur
day. It was the same Frankie Al
bert at quarterback, but this year
he passed with precision and with
little waste of time. It was the same
Norm Standlee, but this time he
had a line to open holes for him,
giving him a chance to flash his
natural speed; and Norm stretched
his runs from the usual five yardi
on power alone to 20 or 30.
VETERANS SHINE
Pete Kmetovic and Hugh Gallar
neau still had the speed and de
ception they showed in flashes last
season, but this year they are using
their abilities at the right time and
in the riglu section. Stan GralT,
another oldtimer, was given a
chance to show what a pass receiver
he Is, and he speared two of Albert's
tosses to set up the third Card
touchdown.
It was the same Freddie Meyer,
but no longer inconsistent. Fred
was pressing all the time, downing
Don punt returners in their tracks
and rushing the dickens out of their
passers. And the same linemen of
old, Rod Warnecke, Ken Robesky,

clear just when it seemed he was
trapped.
The fans' conclusion following the
Indians' victorious debut is that
they play spectators' ball and play
it .successfully. Shaughne&sy's sys
tem strikes with surprise and fe
rocity and every play is a potential
score. The formations and the dis
tractor in particular look screwy,
but 35,000 fans agreed last Satur- !
day that there is method in Shaugh
nessy's madness.
Abraham Lincoln was a direct
descendant of Mordecai Lincoln,
who built a forge at Bound Brook,
Mass., in 1703.
It didn't seem plausible thai a
coach as unsuccessful as Clark
Shaughnessy had been for the last
few years, and a victor,vlcss hall
club like the Indians of "M and
'39, could combine to produce
winning football. But that was
before last Saturday's game when
the odds were lft-7 against them
and before they bruised and bc
wildered the University of San
Francisco into submission 27-0 in
the season's opener.
There were many of the same ball
players who had struggled for the
past two years with little success,
but few would have recognized them
on performance alone last Satur
day. It was the same Frankie Al
bert at quarterback, but this year
he passed with precision and with
little waste of time. It was the same
Norm Standlee, but this time he
had a line to open holes for him,
giving him a chance to flash his
natural speed; and Norm stretched
his runs from the usual five yardi
on power alone to 20 or 30.
VETERANS SHINE
Pete Kmetovic and Hugh Gallar
neau still had the speed and de
ception they showed in flashes last
season, but this year they are using
their abilities at the right time and
in the riglu section. Stan GralT,
another oldtimer, was given a
chance to show what a pass receiver
he Is, and he speared two of Albert's
tosses to set up the third Card
touchdown.
It was the same Freddie Meyer,
but no longer inconsistent. Fred
was pressing all the time, downing
Don punt returners in their tracks
and rushing the dickens out of their
passers. And the same linemen of
old, Rod Warnecke, Ken Robesky,
Doug Stable, Claude Purkitt, and
John Kerman, looked different with
their new-found drive in tackling
and blocking.
SOPHS WENT
Even more of a revelation than
the renovation of the veterans were
the come-through performances <>f
a number of untried sophomores,
The slogan before Saturday's game
had been, "as the soph linemen go,
so goes the Stanford team." That
score of 27-0 ought to be enough
proof of how they went.
Chuck Taylor and Bruno Ban
ducci looked just, as experienced as
any seniors, submarining on de
fense, opening big gaps in the line
on offense, and worrying the U.S.F,
passers to death. Dick Palmer, line
captain, which is quite a responsi
bility for an untried sophomore,
called the defensive signals with
perfection as well as making a good
share of stops from his line-backing
spot.
EVERYBODY PLAYS
Vic Lindskog showed no signs of
his supposed weakness, passing
from center. Ail his centers to punt
formation were 0.K., and Vic made
plenty of stops as the other line
backer. The outstanding sophomore
backfield man was little Eric "Hoot"
Armstrong. On one of those breath
taking quick opener plays, called on
definite instructions by the master
mind Shaughnessy for Armstrong's
benefit, the little guy scampered *{•'>
yards to the Indians' second score.
So complete was the rout of the
Dons that Shaughnessy was able to
use 42 men, clearing the bench of
all men he thought in condition for
action. Bill Willard, end, and Al
Cole, quarterback, weren't wel
enough to play but are sure to set
action in the future.
True, the team got off to a sput
tering start on their first few of
fensive tries. A bix-up in ball han
dling and several offside penalties
made ihem look like shades of '39
But, instead of continuing their
blunders, they soon found them
selves.
Quarterback Albert soon estab
lished in the Dons' minds the threat
of the distractor by flipping a lat
eral pass to Hugh Gallarneau out
at the sidelines and Hugh threaded
his way 17 yards toward the U.S.F.
goal.
THE CHIEF ROLLS
Albert followed with a couple
more passes deep to Gallarneau,
each a potential touchdown, but
the ball just got away from Hugh on
each try. Now, with the opposition
thoroughly seared and expecting a
wide open attack, he called for
Standlee down the middle.
A wide hole was waiting for Norm
and he rolled 21 yards to the 6 to
set up the first touchdown. That
first score was typical of the
Shaughnessy system. It was the
quick opener through guard and
Pete Kmetovic squirted through
the waiting gap and deep into the
end zone to fall only because of his
own momentum. So split-second
was the timing that a charging line
man had his hands on Albert as he
was reversing to Kmetovic but the
ball was safely away and the Cards
had their first touchdown before
the other Dons knew where the
ball was going.
ONE A QUARTER
That was in the first quarter and
the Indians continued to score a
touchdown a period. Armstrong's
run burst like a bombshell on the
baffled Dons. Albert had just
brought back a U.S.F. punt to the
Don 42. Standlee got 2 yards, and
Milt Vucinich, who replaced the
Chief, got three more. And then
there it was—that same quick dash
through guard with little Eric car
lying this time, and going all the
way.
The third period score was set
up by a 35-yard romp by the fleet
Gallarneau and by one of those pre
cision pitches of Albert to Graff who
was waiting wide open just behind
the Don linebackers on the 6-yard
line. It took Standlee, three tries
before he finally power-dived into
the end zone.
BLOCKERS CONNECT
The fourth and final score was a i
good example of how well Shaugh
nessy has coached his boys on fun
damentals: namely, downfield block
ing. It occurred when Kmetovic
toured back 60 yards with an S.F.
punt. The blocking was really
smooth and substitute guard Jack
Francis, a converted fullback, and
fttfd Warnecke eliminated five Dons
1o finally spring Kmetovic into the
clear just when it seemed he was
trapped.
