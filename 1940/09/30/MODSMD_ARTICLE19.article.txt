# Indians Romp Over S.F. With New Razzle-Dazzle System In 27-0 Opener
## Untried Sophs Work Smoothly For New Coach 
### CHUCK SMITH 
It didn't seem plausible thai a
coach as unsuccessful as Clark
Shaughnessy had been for the last
few years, and a victor,vlcss hall
club like the Indians of "M and
'39, could combine to produce
winning football. But that was
before last Saturday's game when
the odds were lft-7 against them
and before they bruised and bc
wildered the University of San
Francisco into submission 27-0 in
the season's opener.
There were many of the same ball
players who had struggled for the
past two years with little success,
but few would have recognized them
on performance alone last Satur
day. It was the same Frankie Al
bert at quarterback, but this year
he passed with precision and with
little waste of time. It was the same
Norm Standlee, but this time he
had a line to open holes for him,
giving him a chance to flash his
natural speed; and Norm stretched
his runs from the usual five yardi
on power alone to 20 or 30.
VETERANS SHINE
Pete Kmetovic and Hugh Gallar
neau still had the speed and de
ception they showed in flashes last
season, but this year they are using
their abilities at the right time and
in the riglu section. Stan GralT,
another oldtimer, was given a
chance to show what a pass receiver
he Is, and he speared two of Albert's
tosses to set up the third Card
touchdown.
It was the same Freddie Meyer,
but no longer inconsistent. Fred
was pressing all the time, downing
Don punt returners in their tracks
and rushing the dickens out of their
passers. And the same linemen of
old, Rod Warnecke, Ken Robesky,
Doug Stable, Claude Purkitt, and
John Kerman, looked different with
their new-found drive in tackling
and blocking.
SOPHS WENT
Even more of a revelation than
the renovation of the veterans were
the come-through performances <>f
a number of untried sophomores,
The slogan before Saturday's game
had been, "as the soph linemen go,
so goes the Stanford team." That
score of 27-0 ought to be enough
proof of how they went.
Chuck Taylor and Bruno Ban
ducci looked just, as experienced as
any seniors, submarining on de
fense, opening big gaps in the line
on offense, and worrying the U.S.F,
passers to death. Dick Palmer, line
captain, which is quite a responsi
bility for an untried sophomore,
called the defensive signals with
perfection as well as making a good
share of stops from his line-backing
spot.
EVERYBODY PLAYS
Vic Lindskog showed no signs of
his supposed weakness, passing
from center. Ail his centers to punt
formation were 0.K., and Vic made
plenty of stops as the other line
backer. The outstanding sophomore
backfield man was little Eric "Hoot"
Armstrong. On one of those breath
taking quick opener plays, called on
definite instructions by the master
mind Shaughnessy for Armstrong's
benefit, the little guy scampered *{•'>
yards to the Indians' second score.
So complete was the rout of the
Dons that Shaughnessy was able to
use 42 men, clearing the bench of
all men he thought in condition for
action. Bill Willard, end, and Al
