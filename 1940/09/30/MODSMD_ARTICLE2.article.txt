# Washington Sees Closer Military Operations With Twenty Sister Republics
## Western Hemisphere Co-operation Would Be America's Answer to New Berlin-Rome-Tokyo Understanding 
### 
WASHINGTON, Sept. 2!) (UP). —Informed sources predicted tonight
that closer military co-operation between the United States and her 20
sister American rcpuhlics soon will be established as an answer to the
new Berlin-Rome-Tokyo pact.
Observers emphasized the importance of the forthcoming inspection
of United States defease establishments by military chieftains of Latin

American nations, since this country
is seeking greater co-operation 1
among the 21 republics.
The visit of the Latin Americans,
it was pointed out, would provide
an excellent opportunity for full
discussion of mutual problems and
proposals for pooling of resources
and facilities. Observers also noted
that a display of this country's de
fenses might have a psychological
effect on the visitors which would
be beneficial from this country's
viewpoint.
INSPECTION TOUR
Twenty-three military experts
from nine American nations—many
of whom already are in Washing
ton —start their inspection tour
Tuesday. Military representatives
of the other 11 American republics
will start a similar tour Oct. 16.
Some informed quarters believed
that the tours might result in pro
mulgation of technical plans for
technical defense, which later
would be submitted to the 21 re
publics through diplomatic chan
nels for formal consideration.
CLOSER FEELING
Most observers felt that, in any
event, the new Axis treaty will tend
to draw the American nations closer
together and stimulate plans for
defending the Western Hemisphere
against any attempted invasion.
Some sources believed it possible
that an agreement might be reached I
which would be tantamount to a
mutual assistance pact. Such a pact,
as envisioned by these observers,
would provide that if any American
nation were attacked, its 20 sister
republics would come to her aid.
It was expected that any agree
ment which might be worked out
probably would embrace the joint
use of selected naval and air bases
of each American nation by the
other American republics.
AGREEMENT RECALLED
Observers pointed out that the
Americas, in the Buenos Aires and
Lima conferences of 1936 and 1938
respectively, in effect adopted the
principle that a threat to the secu
rity of one American republic is a
threat to the security of all.
It was regarded as entirely logical
that this principle now should be
implemented by practical military
agreements, in view of the menacing
world situation.
There was some discussion that
establishment of a Pan-American
defense board, similar to the re
cently established U.S. - Canadian
joint defense board, might be under
consideration. Observers speculated
that such a body might be set up
as a permanent group to map con
tinental defense plans.

tinental defense plans.
WASHINGTON, Sept. 2!) (UP). —Informed sources predicted tonight
that closer military co-operation between the United States and her 20
sister American rcpuhlics soon will be established as an answer to the
new Berlin-Rome-Tokyo pact.
Observers emphasized the importance of the forthcoming inspection
of United States defease establishments by military chieftains of Latin

American nations, since this country
is seeking greater co-operation 1
among the 21 republics.
The visit of the Latin Americans,
it was pointed out, would provide
an excellent opportunity for full
discussion of mutual problems and
proposals for pooling of resources
and facilities. Observers also noted
that a display of this country's de
fenses might have a psychological
effect on the visitors which would
be beneficial from this country's
viewpoint.
INSPECTION TOUR
Twenty-three military experts
from nine American nations—many
of whom already are in Washing
ton —start their inspection tour
Tuesday. Military representatives
of the other 11 American republics
will start a similar tour Oct. 16.
Some informed quarters believed
that the tours might result in pro
mulgation of technical plans for
technical defense, which later
would be submitted to the 21 re
publics through diplomatic chan
nels for formal consideration.
CLOSER FEELING
Most observers felt that, in any
event, the new Axis treaty will tend
to draw the American nations closer
together and stimulate plans for
defending the Western Hemisphere
against any attempted invasion.
Some sources believed it possible
that an agreement might be reached I
which would be tantamount to a
mutual assistance pact. Such a pact,
as envisioned by these observers,
would provide that if any American
nation were attacked, its 20 sister
republics would come to her aid.
It was expected that any agree
ment which might be worked out
probably would embrace the joint
use of selected naval and air bases
of each American nation by the
other American republics.
AGREEMENT RECALLED
Observers pointed out that the
Americas, in the Buenos Aires and
Lima conferences of 1936 and 1938
respectively, in effect adopted the
principle that a threat to the secu
rity of one American republic is a
threat to the security of all.
It was regarded as entirely logical
that this principle now should be
implemented by practical military
agreements, in view of the menacing
world situation.
There was some discussion that
establishment of a Pan-American
defense board, similar to the re
cently established U.S. - Canadian
joint defense board, might be under
consideration. Observers speculated
that such a body might be set up
as a permanent group to map con
tinental defense plans.
