# British Expect Hitler's Threatened 'Zero Hour'
## Royal Air Force Assaults Berlin, Naval Buses. 600 Miles of Coast 
### 
LONDON, Sept. 2!) (UP). —British naval authorities warned tonight the
"zero hour" of Adolf Hitler's invasion plans may he approaching follow
ing shattering new K.A.F. assaults on Berlin, naval bases and a (>OO-mile
sire/eh of the Nazi-held Channel coast.
Cuie tonight Nazi "invasion bases" along the Channel toast were under

blasting attack of British
which flew through a heavy rain
.storm to strike simultaneously at a
dozen or more points.
Watchers on the Dover coast saw
bomb flashes all along the French
coast and the attack appeared to be
particularly heavy around Boulogne.
SEASONAL LULLS
"There are, as the Navy knows,
seasonal lulls to come and one of
these would normally make it pos
sible for such craft as the Germans
have assembled to be used," it was
.said.
"During the next few weeks, for
example, there should occur a 'sec
ond summer' period of temporary
• aim when an attempt could be
made.
"If the Germans are hoping that
by thus delaying their attempt they
are more likely to catch us some
what off guard they will be severely
disappointed."
The Air Ministry said British
bombers sweeping 600 miles across
Ihe Channel and western Germany
to Berlin Saturday night heavily
bombed electric power stations and
anti-aircraft positions of the Ger
man capital.
SURPRISE BLOW
The Germans may attempt to
launch their invasion with a mighty
.surprise blow "in hopes of catching
us somewhat off guard," a naval
.spokesman said, but the British fleet
i.s "determined not to relax for one
moment."
Widespread night bombing of Hit
ler's coastal "invasion bases," Ber
lin's vital power stations, Reich rail
roads and airdromes and Wilhelm
shafen naval base were described
after the nearest approach to a Sab
bath calm that London has known
in three weeks.
Following a night of comparative
quiet with only sporadic bombing
and gunfire in the metropolitan
areas, there were two daylight ail
raid alarms Sunday but no bombers
were heard crashing in the central
part of the city.

Naval quarters said that Hitler's
vast plans for invasion were pro
ceeding "consistently," under the
rain of R.A.F. bombs and a period
of "second summer" along the
Channel with its temporary cairn
might be the signal for the Nazi
attempt.
Night and day, they said, the Ger
mans are massing troops, supplies,
and ships opposite the British coast.
BASE ATTACKED
Wilhelmshafen naval base was
"strongly attacked" and great fires
and explosions broke out under the
smashing of big bombs, it was said,
while other British planes were
pounding heavily at the Nazi-held
Channel coast "in spite of bad
weather."
Two British planes failed to re
turn from the night attacks.
The night bombings ranged along
a 600-mile stretch of the Channel
coast from Dunkerqiie south to the
French Brittany port and shipbuild
ing center of Lorient, attacked for
the second consecutive night. Heav
ily bombed along the coast were Le
Havre, Fecamp, Boulogne, Calais,
Dunkerque and Lorient.
Other British planes bombed im
portant railroad centers of western
and northern Germany, as well as
airdromes, and "severe damage"
was said to have been inflicted upon
a munitions works at Hanau near
Frankfurt.
The emplacements of Germany's
"Big Bertha" guns at Cape Gris Nez
opposite Dover likewise felt the
blows of British bombs, hurled with
such destructive force that houses
on the British side of the Dover
Straits 22 to 30 miles away rocked
with concussions.

"If the Germans are hoping that

The Air Ministry said British
bombers sweeping 600 miles across
Ihe Channel and western Germany
to Berlin Saturday night heavily
bombed electric power stations and
anti-aircraft positions of the Ger
man capital.
SURPRISE BLOW
The Germans may attempt to
launch their invasion with a mighty
.surprise blow "in hopes of catching
us somewhat off guard," a naval
.spokesman said, but the British fleet
i.s "determined not to relax for one
moment."
Widespread night bombing of Hit
ler's coastal "invasion bases," Ber
lin's vital power stations, Reich rail
roads and airdromes and Wilhelm
shafen naval base were described
after the nearest approach to a Sab
bath calm that London has known
in three weeks.
Following a night of comparative
quiet with only sporadic bombing
and gunfire in the metropolitan
areas, there were two daylight ail
raid alarms Sunday but no bombers
were heard crashing in the central
part of the city.

Naval quarters said that Hitler's
vast plans for invasion were pro
ceeding "consistently," under the
rain of R.A.F. bombs and a period
of "second summer" along the
Channel with its temporary cairn
might be the signal for the Nazi
attempt.
Night and day, they said, the Ger
mans are massing troops, supplies,
and ships opposite the British coast.
BASE ATTACKED
Wilhelmshafen naval base was
"strongly attacked" and great fires
and explosions broke out under the
smashing of big bombs, it was said,
while other British planes were
pounding heavily at the Nazi-held
Channel coast "in spite of bad
weather."
Two British planes failed to re
turn from the night attacks.
The night bombings ranged along
a 600-mile stretch of the Channel
coast from Dunkerqiie south to the
French Brittany port and shipbuild
ing center of Lorient, attacked for
the second consecutive night. Heav
ily bombed along the coast were Le
Havre, Fecamp, Boulogne, Calais,
Dunkerque and Lorient.
Other British planes bombed im
portant railroad centers of western
and northern Germany, as well as
airdromes, and "severe damage"
was said to have been inflicted upon
a munitions works at Hanau near
Frankfurt.
The emplacements of Germany's
"Big Bertha" guns at Cape Gris Nez
opposite Dover likewise felt the
blows of British bombs, hurled with
such destructive force that houses
on the British side of the Dover
Straits 22 to 30 miles away rocked
with concussions.

vast plans for invasion were pro

weather."
Two British planes failed to re
turn from the night attacks.
The night bombings ranged along
a 600-mile stretch of the Channel
coast from Dunkerqiie south to the
French Brittany port and shipbuild
ing center of Lorient, attacked for
the second consecutive night. Heav
ily bombed along the coast were Le
Havre, Fecamp, Boulogne, Calais,
Dunkerque and Lorient.
Other British planes bombed im
portant railroad centers of western
and northern Germany, as well as
airdromes, and "severe damage"
was said to have been inflicted upon
a munitions works at Hanau near
Frankfurt.
The emplacements of Germany's
"Big Bertha" guns at Cape Gris Nez
opposite Dover likewise felt the
blows of British bombs, hurled with
such destructive force that houses
on the British side of the Dover
Straits 22 to 30 miles away rocked
with concussions.
