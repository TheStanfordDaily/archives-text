# II Duce Warns U.S. 'keep Out'
## Triple Alliance Called 'Peace Instrument' 
### 
Rome, Sept. 29 (UP). â€”Premier
Benito Mussolini's own newspaper, j
11 Popolo d Italia, tonight bluntly I
warned the United States that it '
will go down to "defeat and de
struction' at the hands of the Axis
powers if it enters the European
war.
Insisting that Germany, Italy and
Japan are anxious to maintain
friendship with the United States
and that their new triple alliance
is "a great peace instrument," II ;
Duce's newspaper said that the
American people themselves might
force its transformation into a war
! instrument.
The Popolo d'ltalia said that Eng
l lish Jewry and North American
i plutocracy have put in motion a
"diabolical plan for their own
selfish oligarchial interests to prod
the United States into war.
These elements, it was alleged,
are trying to force the United States
into a position "which inexorably
condemns the "North American
armed forces to defeat and destruc
tion."
If this comes about, Mussolini's
| newspaper said, the United States
j will be completely crushed.
"This defeat will dissolve like
I clouds in the sun the might of North
American power," it said.
"It will subject North American
homes to useless fighting, bring
about the loss of various world
wide positions now heLd by the
United States."
Eight of Arizona's 14 counties are
named for Indian tribes.
