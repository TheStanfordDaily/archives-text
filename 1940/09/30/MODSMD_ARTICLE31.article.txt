### JERRY BRUCKER 
BIG RED MACHINE
WAS
It is practically impossible to de
scribe the great showing Coach Clark
Shaughnessy's Indians made in Ke
zar Stadium Saturday. Perhaps the
best way would be to leave a couple
of paragraphs, of blanks and let ev
eryone fill in their own. Anyway,
that Big Red Machine was
Stanford's rooting section was
made up of a bunch of wild-eyed
maniacs Saturday afternoon as it
watched George Malley's U. S. F.
Dons take a thorough lesson in foot
ball technique. A.s one rooter said,
"'Tain't what they do, it's the way
that they do it.",
A 27-0 win after the last few
bleak seasons was mighty welcome,
but it was the way the Big Red
Machine, after a little carburetor
trouble in the first few minutes,
went about hanging up an upset
victory that impressed Stanford
fans.
* * *
Picking one outstanding player in
that game Saturday is a very tough
assignment, and a rather foolish
one, but I've got to try and do it.
NBC's Western Football Forecast, a
weekly feature heard here over KGO
at 8:30 o'clock every Friday, offers
a "Charley," griddom's equivalent of
Hollywood's "Oscar," to the man
voted the outstanding player of the
week.
Considering the fine work of the
entire squad, and the great per
formances of such as Chuck Taylor,
Bruno Banducci, Frankie Albert,
Norm Standlee, ePte Kmetovic, and
Eric Armstrong, to mention only a
few, it's unfair to place one above
the others.
I think my vote will go to the
Stanford TEAM.

It was the middle of the fourth

could carry the battle to the enemy
just -once.

length of the hall was just over

Then the referee moved it back so

After an incomplete pass Michi

Picking one outstanding player in
that game Saturday is a very tough
assignment, and a rather foolish
one, but I've got to try and do it.
NBC's Western Football Forecast, a
weekly feature heard here over KGO
at 8:30 o'clock every Friday, offers
a "Charley," griddom's equivalent of
Hollywood's "Oscar," to the man
voted the outstanding player of the
week.
Considering the fine work of the
entire squad, and the great per
formances of such as Chuck Taylor,
Bruno Banducci, Frankie Albert,
Norm Standlee, ePte Kmetovic, and
Eric Armstrong, to mention only a
few, it's unfair to place one above
the others.
I think my vote will go to the
Stanford TEAM.
