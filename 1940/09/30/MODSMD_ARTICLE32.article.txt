## 
### 
If Coach Harry Shipkey's 1910
frosh grid crew hasn't anything
else oil the ball, they certainly
should be in good physical condi
tion for their first game of the
season, which will be played
against San Mateo Junior College
in Stanford Stadium as a prelimi
nary to the Stanford Varsity-Uni
versity of Oregon contest.
Foi the lrosh have been, and are
being, put through a rugged prac
tice period in preparation for the
game. As a matter of fact, Shipkey
| sent his charges through tough
scrimmages on Thursday, Friday,
and Saturday of last week. As if
; that were not enough, another
scrum is on tap for this afternoon.
Work last Friday consisted mostly
of practice under fire on pass plays
as the Papoose squad went through
an aerial attack scrimmage. This
was in accordance with Shipkey's
! plans to spend all last week on
j passes.
Saturday morning saw the year
; ling squad go through a tough regu
lar game scrum which lasted an
j hour and a half. The first team
. started against the thirds and, dur-
I ing the time they were playing,
: showed to good advantage. This
week Shipkey will probably feature
work on a running attack.
