# DODGERS DOWN PITT
## 
### 
PITTSBURGH. Sept. 29 (UP). â€”
Doctor Jock Sutherland played his
same old role of winning football
coach here today. Making his first
appearance in the smoky city since
he resigned as coach of the Univer
sity of Pittsburgh Panthers in 1938,
Sutherland masterminded his pro
fessional Brooklyn Dodgers to a 10
to 3 victory over the Steelers in a
National League game.
