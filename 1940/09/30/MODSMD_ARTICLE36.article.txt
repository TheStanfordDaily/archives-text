### 
With play starting next week,
sign-ups for volleyball and foot
ball for Stanford's 1940-41 intra
mural season begin today. Teams
intending to compete should place
their names on the list in the
gym. All men qualified to referee
touch football may contact Burt
Pike, intramural manager, some
time this week.
