# Stanford White Paper
## 
### 
A COMPACT white booklet with its cover
inscribed in cardinal and titled "Constitu
tion and By-Laws of Associated Students of
Stanford University, 1940" is the rod and rule
by which are measured the actions of the Farm
student body and the various sub-organizations
of that group.
Student leaders and faculty members will
thumb through the 165 pages of this pamphlet
many times before the 1940-41 school year
over, will read from its pages the gospel which
settles any and all disputes on regulation, dele
gations of power, duties and privileges pertain
ing to the Associated Students of Stanford Uni
versity.
But the little booklet is overwhelmingly ob
tuse and difficult to understand, often wordy
and duplicative, and may in several instances
be at variance with the actual amendments and
by-laws passed by the members of this student
body and Ex Committee.
These difficulties and incorrections are not
the inherent fault of the Constitution and its
By-Laws, nor are they the fault of Excom. It
is the system which is to blame.
Within the Constitution is an article giving
Excom the right to propose amendments and
submit them to the members of the student
body for adoption. Publication of the proposed
amendment must be made in The Daily before
it may be voted upon, and two-thirds of the
ballots cast on a proposed amendment are re
quired for its adoption.
Only twice during the past three years
have the students of the University voted
upon an amendment to the Constitution. This
does not mean that only two changes have
been made in the "rule book" since 1937.
Instead it means that Excom in most cases
has employed the legislative shortcut which
enables it to side-step administrative red
tape in all but matters of extreme importance,
and instead has made and amended BY
LAWS to the Constitution.
The by-laws and charters under the Consti
tution may be made, amended or revoked by
the vote of three-quarters of the voting mem
bership of the Executive Committee at a regu
lar meeting. In this way Excom can complete
minor rulings without a student body vote on
the matter.
This ability has given an often-harassed Ex
com opportunity to complete business upon
its docket without the tedium and red-tape sur
rounding a student body vote. In this, its major
reason for being, the power has been a good
one.
But this system has another result. By-law
after by-law, amendment after amendment, have
piled up on one another to an alarming extent.
The little white booklet grows bigger every
year.
A section makes a statement and lays down
a rule. Sometimes that rule is still pertinent,
sometimes it is supplanted or amended out
of existence by a following article. The read
er who does not scan his pages carefully may
often find himself barking up the wrong tree.
In other cases sections are so out-dated as to
have absolutely no bearing upon the present
student body of the University. An "emergency
clause" may have permitted certain special
action to take place in 1935, but is greatly out
of place in the by-laws for 1940. In still fur
ther cases, sections and articles are seemingly
worded with an eye toward making them ab
solutely non-understandable.
Article 11, section 2b, paragraph 8 of the Con
stitution provides for the yearly publication of
the Constitution, the by-laws, and indirectly for
the various student charters. The writing, revi
sion, and publication of this booklet are done
by persons not necessarily members of Excom
or closely acquainted with Stanford's adminis
trative affairs, but by persons chosen by Excom
from a list of student applications for the posi
tion of Freshman Handbook editor.
In beginning the publication of the Consti
tution and by-laws, these editors have at their
recourse two principal fountains of information:
(1) the preceding year's official booklet; (2) Ex
Committee minutes in which are inscribed all
by-laws and amendments passed during the
year. In order for a comprehensive and accu
rate Constitution, the minutes of an entire year
of I.xcom meetings must be scanned for all
reports of such action.
In certain cases the contents of the preceding
year s Constitution, instead of being helpful, are
found to contain so many inaccuracies as to be

almost useless. Should this be so, the minutes
of every Excom meeting since 1932, the last
time that the Constitution was completely re
vise.d and published in full, must be carefully
studied to catch the errors.
Instead of being an official doctrine, the
Constitution takes on the aspect of a con
tinual, yearly comedy of errors.
However, it must again be repeated that the
system alone is at fault. The system is one
which by action of Excom may be repaired and
put into excellent working order for the years
and the Constitutions to come.
This suggestion is offered:
A committee of several students should be
appointed by Excom to bring the Constitution,
its by-laws and charters thoroughly and com
pletely up to date. This committee, in order to
make its efforts as exact as possible, should
begin its research with the published Consti
tution of 1932, and should study Excom minutes
and amendments voted upon by the student
body since that time.
A constitutional master-file should be cre
ated, in which the Constitution would be
kept. Each article, section, clause, and so on
should be printed on a separate card and filed
consecutively in proper order. This master
file should be kept in the A.S.S.U. offices
and should be accessible to student and fac
ulty officials when needed.
Each new by-law, amendment, or revision
should be printed upon similar cards, and
should be inserted in its correct place in the
master-file. Should older by-laws be antiquated
by this new ruling, they should be taken from
the file and discarded.
Such a master-file system, preceded by a
competent check which would render the Con
stitution completely modern, would eliminate
almost entirely the difficulties encountered
under the present arrangement.
The Constitution and by-laws of the Asso
ciated Students of Stanford University are con
sidered accurate. Let's make them so.â€”W. C.

Only twice during the past three years
have the students of the University voted
upon an amendment to the Constitution. This
does not mean that only two changes have
been made in the "rule book" since 1937.
Instead it means that Excom in most cases
has employed the legislative shortcut which
enables it to side-step administrative red
tape in all but matters of extreme importance,
and instead has made and amended BY
LAWS to the Constitution.
The by-laws and charters under the Consti
tution may be made, amended or revoked by
the vote of three-quarters of the voting mem
bership of the Executive Committee at a regu
lar meeting. In this way Excom can complete
minor rulings without a student body vote on
the matter.
This ability has given an often-harassed Ex
com opportunity to complete business upon
its docket without the tedium and red-tape sur
rounding a student body vote. In this, its major
reason for being, the power has been a good
one.
But this system has another result. By-law
after by-law, amendment after amendment, have
piled up on one another to an alarming extent.
The little white booklet grows bigger every
year.
A section makes a statement and lays down
a rule. Sometimes that rule is still pertinent,
sometimes it is supplanted or amended out
of existence by a following article. The read
er who does not scan his pages carefully may
often find himself barking up the wrong tree.
In other cases sections are so out-dated as to
have absolutely no bearing upon the present
student body of the University. An "emergency
clause" may have permitted certain special
action to take place in 1935, but is greatly out
of place in the by-laws for 1940. In still fur
ther cases, sections and articles are seemingly
worded with an eye toward making them ab
solutely non-understandable.
Article 11, section 2b, paragraph 8 of the Con
stitution provides for the yearly publication of
the Constitution, the by-laws, and indirectly for
the various student charters. The writing, revi
sion, and publication of this booklet are done
by persons not necessarily members of Excom
or closely acquainted with Stanford's adminis
trative affairs, but by persons chosen by Excom
from a list of student applications for the posi
tion of Freshman Handbook editor.
In beginning the publication of the Consti
tution and by-laws, these editors have at their
recourse two principal fountains of information:
(1) the preceding year's official booklet; (2) Ex
Committee minutes in which are inscribed all
by-laws and amendments passed during the
year. In order for a comprehensive and accu
rate Constitution, the minutes of an entire year
of I.xcom meetings must be scanned for all
reports of such action.
In certain cases the contents of the preceding
year s Constitution, instead of being helpful, are
found to contain so many inaccuracies as to be

almost useless. Should this be so, the minutes
of every Excom meeting since 1932, the last
time that the Constitution was completely re
vise.d and published in full, must be carefully
studied to catch the errors.
Instead of being an official doctrine, the
Constitution takes on the aspect of a con
tinual, yearly comedy of errors.
However, it must again be repeated that the
system alone is at fault. The system is one
which by action of Excom may be repaired and
put into excellent working order for the years
and the Constitutions to come.
This suggestion is offered:
A committee of several students should be
appointed by Excom to bring the Constitution,
its by-laws and charters thoroughly and com
pletely up to date. This committee, in order to
make its efforts as exact as possible, should
begin its research with the published Consti
tution of 1932, and should study Excom minutes
and amendments voted upon by the student
body since that time.
A constitutional master-file should be cre
ated, in which the Constitution would be
kept. Each article, section, clause, and so on
should be printed on a separate card and filed
consecutively in proper order. This master
file should be kept in the A.S.S.U. offices
and should be accessible to student and fac
ulty officials when needed.
Each new by-law, amendment, or revision
should be printed upon similar cards, and
should be inserted in its correct place in the
master-file. Should older by-laws be antiquated
by this new ruling, they should be taken from
the file and discarded.
Such a master-file system, preceded by a
competent check which would render the Con
stitution completely modern, would eliminate
almost entirely the difficulties encountered
under the present arrangement.

A COMPACT white booklet with its cover

Stanford University, 1940" is the rod and rule
by which are measured the actions of the Farm
student body and the various sub-organizations
of that group.
Student leaders and faculty members will

er who does not scan his pages carefully may
often find himself barking up the wrong tree.
In other cases sections are so out-dated as to
have absolutely no bearing upon the present
student body of the University. An "emergency
clause" may have permitted certain special
action to take place in 1935, but is greatly out
of place in the by-laws for 1940. In still fur

worded with an eye toward making them ab

Article 11, section 2b, paragraph 8 of the Con
stitution provides for the yearly publication of
the Constitution, the by-laws, and indirectly for
the various student charters. The writing, revi
sion, and publication of this booklet are done
by persons not necessarily members of Excom
or closely acquainted with Stanford's adminis
trative affairs, but by persons chosen by Excom
from a list of student applications for the posi
tion of Freshman Handbook editor.
In beginning the publication of the Consti
tution and by-laws, these editors have at their
recourse two principal fountains of information:
(1) the preceding year's official booklet; (2) Ex
Committee minutes in which are inscribed all
by-laws and amendments passed during the
year. In order for a comprehensive and accu
rate Constitution, the minutes of an entire year
of I.xcom meetings must be scanned for all
reports of such action.
In certain cases the contents of the preceding
year s Constitution, instead of being helpful, are
found to contain so many inaccuracies as to be

almost useless. Should this be so, the minutes
of every Excom meeting since 1932, the last
time that the Constitution was completely re
vise.d and published in full, must be carefully
studied to catch the errors.
Instead of being an official doctrine, the
Constitution takes on the aspect of a con
tinual, yearly comedy of errors.
However, it must again be repeated that the
system alone is at fault. The system is one
which by action of Excom may be repaired and
put into excellent working order for the years
and the Constitutions to come.
This suggestion is offered:
A committee of several students should be
appointed by Excom to bring the Constitution,
its by-laws and charters thoroughly and com
pletely up to date. This committee, in order to
make its efforts as exact as possible, should
begin its research with the published Consti
tution of 1932, and should study Excom minutes
and amendments voted upon by the student
body since that time.
A constitutional master-file should be cre
ated, in which the Constitution would be
kept. Each article, section, clause, and so on
should be printed on a separate card and filed
consecutively in proper order. This master
file should be kept in the A.S.S.U. offices
and should be accessible to student and fac
ulty officials when needed.
Each new by-law, amendment, or revision
should be printed upon similar cards, and
should be inserted in its correct place in the
master-file. Should older by-laws be antiquated
by this new ruling, they should be taken from
the file and discarded.
Such a master-file system, preceded by a
competent check which would render the Con
stitution completely modern, would eliminate
almost entirely the difficulties encountered
under the present arrangement.

A COMPACT white booklet with its cover
inscribed in cardinal and titled "Constitu
tion and By-Laws of Associated Students of
Stanford University, 1940" is the rod and rule
by which are measured the actions of the Farm
student body and the various sub-organizations
of that group.
Student leaders and faculty members will
thumb through the 165 pages of this pamphlet
many times before the 1940-41 school year
over, will read from its pages the gospel which
settles any and all disputes on regulation, dele
gations of power, duties and privileges pertain
ing to the Associated Students of Stanford Uni
versity.
But the little booklet is overwhelmingly ob
tuse and difficult to understand, often wordy
and duplicative, and may in several instances
be at variance with the actual amendments and
by-laws passed by the members of this student
body and Ex Committee.
These difficulties and incorrections are not
the inherent fault of the Constitution and its
By-Laws, nor are they the fault of Excom. It
is the system which is to blame.
Within the Constitution is an article giving
Excom the right to propose amendments and
submit them to the members of the student
body for adoption. Publication of the proposed
amendment must be made in The Daily before
it may be voted upon, and two-thirds of the
ballots cast on a proposed amendment are re
quired for its adoption.
Only twice during the past three years
have the students of the University voted
upon an amendment to the Constitution. This
does not mean that only two changes have
been made in the "rule book" since 1937.
Instead it means that Excom in most cases
has employed the legislative shortcut which
enables it to side-step administrative red
tape in all but matters of extreme importance,
and instead has made and amended BY
LAWS to the Constitution.
The by-laws and charters under the Consti
tution may be made, amended or revoked by
the vote of three-quarters of the voting mem
bership of the Executive Committee at a regu
lar meeting. In this way Excom can complete
minor rulings without a student body vote on
the matter.
This ability has given an often-harassed Ex
com opportunity to complete business upon
its docket without the tedium and red-tape sur
rounding a student body vote. In this, its major
reason for being, the power has been a good
one.
But this system has another result. By-law
after by-law, amendment after amendment, have
piled up on one another to an alarming extent.
The little white booklet grows bigger every
year.
A section makes a statement and lays down
a rule. Sometimes that rule is still pertinent,
sometimes it is supplanted or amended out

of I.xcom meetings must be scanned for all
reports of such action.
In certain cases the contents of the preceding
year s Constitution, instead of being helpful, are
found to contain so many inaccuracies as to be

almost useless. Should this be so, the minutes
of every Excom meeting since 1932, the last
time that the Constitution was completely re
vise.d and published in full, must be carefully
studied to catch the errors.
Instead of being an official doctrine, the
Constitution takes on the aspect of a con
tinual, yearly comedy of errors.
However, it must again be repeated that the
system alone is at fault. The system is one
which by action of Excom may be repaired and
put into excellent working order for the years
and the Constitutions to come.
This suggestion is offered:
A committee of several students should be
appointed by Excom to bring the Constitution,
its by-laws and charters thoroughly and com
pletely up to date. This committee, in order to
make its efforts as exact as possible, should
begin its research with the published Consti
tution of 1932, and should study Excom minutes
and amendments voted upon by the student
body since that time.
A constitutional master-file should be cre
ated, in which the Constitution would be
kept. Each article, section, clause, and so on
should be printed on a separate card and filed
consecutively in proper order. This master
file should be kept in the A.S.S.U. offices
and should be accessible to student and fac
ulty officials when needed.
Each new by-law, amendment, or revision
should be printed upon similar cards, and
should be inserted in its correct place in the
master-file. Should older by-laws be antiquated
by this new ruling, they should be taken from
the file and discarded.
Such a master-file system, preceded by a
competent check which would render the Con
stitution completely modern, would eliminate
almost entirely the difficulties encountered
under the present arrangement.
The Constitution and by-laws of the Asso
ciated Students of Stanford University are con
sidered accurate. Let's make them so.â€”W. C.
A COMPACT white booklet with its cover
inscribed in cardinal and titled "Constitu
tion and By-Laws of Associated Students of
Stanford University, 1940" is the rod and rule
by which are measured the actions of the Farm
student body and the various sub-organizations
of that group.
Student leaders and faculty members will
thumb through the 165 pages of this pamphlet
many times before the 1940-41 school year
over, will read from its pages the gospel which
settles any and all disputes on regulation, dele
gations of power, duties and privileges pertain
ing to the Associated Students of Stanford Uni
versity.
But the little booklet is overwhelmingly ob
tuse and difficult to understand, often wordy
and duplicative, and may in several instances
be at variance with the actual amendments and
by-laws passed by the members of this student
body and Ex Committee.
These difficulties and incorrections are not
the inherent fault of the Constitution and its
By-Laws, nor are they the fault of Excom. It
is the system which is to blame.
Within the Constitution is an article giving
Excom the right to propose amendments and
submit them to the members of the student
body for adoption. Publication of the proposed
amendment must be made in The Daily before
it may be voted upon, and two-thirds of the
ballots cast on a proposed amendment are re
quired for its adoption.
Only twice during the past three years
have the students of the University voted
upon an amendment to the Constitution. This
does not mean that only two changes have
been made in the "rule book" since 1937.
Instead it means that Excom in most cases
has employed the legislative shortcut which
enables it to side-step administrative red
tape in all but matters of extreme importance,
and instead has made and amended BY
LAWS to the Constitution.
The by-laws and charters under the Consti
tution may be made, amended or revoked by
the vote of three-quarters of the voting mem
bership of the Executive Committee at a regu
lar meeting. In this way Excom can complete
minor rulings without a student body vote on
the matter.
This ability has given an often-harassed Ex
com opportunity to complete business upon
its docket without the tedium and red-tape sur
rounding a student body vote. In this, its major
reason for being, the power has been a good
one.
But this system has another result. By-law
after by-law, amendment after amendment, have
piled up on one another to an alarming extent.
The little white booklet grows bigger every
year.
A section makes a statement and lays down
a rule. Sometimes that rule is still pertinent,
sometimes it is supplanted or amended out
of existence by a following article. The read
er who does not scan his pages carefully may
often find himself barking up the wrong tree.
In other cases sections are so out-dated as to
have absolutely no bearing upon the present
student body of the University. An "emergency
clause" may have permitted certain special
action to take place in 1935, but is greatly out
of place in the by-laws for 1940. In still fur
ther cases, sections and articles are seemingly
worded with an eye toward making them ab
solutely non-understandable.
Article 11, section 2b, paragraph 8 of the Con
stitution provides for the yearly publication of
the Constitution, the by-laws, and indirectly for
the various student charters. The writing, revi
sion, and publication of this booklet are done
by persons not necessarily members of Excom
or closely acquainted with Stanford's adminis
trative affairs, but by persons chosen by Excom
from a list of student applications for the posi
tion of Freshman Handbook editor.
In beginning the publication of the Consti
tution and by-laws, these editors have at their
recourse two principal fountains of information:
(1) the preceding year's official booklet; (2) Ex
Committee minutes in which are inscribed all
by-laws and amendments passed during the
year. In order for a comprehensive and accu
rate Constitution, the minutes of an entire year
of I.xcom meetings must be scanned for all
reports of such action.
In certain cases the contents of the preceding
year s Constitution, instead of being helpful, are
found to contain so many inaccuracies as to be

almost useless. Should this be so, the minutes
of every Excom meeting since 1932, the last
time that the Constitution was completely re
vise.d and published in full, must be carefully
studied to catch the errors.
Instead of being an official doctrine, the
Constitution takes on the aspect of a con
tinual, yearly comedy of errors.
However, it must again be repeated that the
system alone is at fault. The system is one
which by action of Excom may be repaired and
put into excellent working order for the years
and the Constitutions to come.
This suggestion is offered:
A committee of several students should be
appointed by Excom to bring the Constitution,
its by-laws and charters thoroughly and com
pletely up to date. This committee, in order to
