### BUD AMES 
YOU GOT PLENTY O' NOTHIN'
evci'y speech, Willkie appears to grow in his
ability to say more and, at the same time, say
less than any politician now blarney-storming around
the country.
After what Mr. Willkie shouted last Saturday at the
Empire City Race Track (of all places), he and Mr.
Hitler should soon be coming to blows; that is, if the
November election goes Republican with a few Demo
crats and Liberals thrown in for good measure. You've
heard, haven't you, about Hitler's holding a few plans
of his own for the world? Well, last Saturday, that
nasty Mr. Willkie upset the whole apple cart. Mr.
Willkie is a man of the peeple. First he ran his fingers
through his hair, then he picked a little wax from his
ear, and then he mouthed, "If you elect me Prezzdent
Uni' States, I pledge you a new world."
On rye bread, that would be swell.
* * * *
'J'HIS whole thing is remindful of a recent New Yorker
cartoon in which a laborer turns suddenly from
the radio to his wife working over a wash tub, and
says, "He just gave the world twenty-four hours to
get out." Don't you wonder where Willkie is going
to get that new world? Of course, the Republican
party and Mr. Willkie tell us that Mr. Willkie's powers
are limitless. But this thing has got to end somewhere.
Pledging a new world is almost as extreme as—as —as
pledging a new world.
Perhaps you think that that is stretching the point
too far, and that we are just quibbling over how many
angels can stand on the point of a pin. You're right;
its patterned after most of Mr. Willkie's speeches
which bulge at the seams with such succulent terms
as "liberal advance," "protect American enterprise,"
and "poverty and exploitation." Or do you like, "They
(Willkie's pledges) must be fulfilled in steel and con
crete, and in the flesh and blood of men"?
Read his speech, read all of it, and when you get
through, you will know no more than you did at the
first word. Of course, Mr. Willkie isn't expected to
present detailed plans of his policies in one speech.
But in his tour across the country he might have
hinted at them. People can't vote for American enter
prise or poverty and exploitation.
* * * *
IN the same speech, Willkie said, and repeated, "The
American people admire simplicity. They are
frugal. They are honest."
It begins to look like he is correct. A recent con
versation with a representative of a polling company
uncovered that Mr. Willkie's speeches in San Fran
cisco gained him many votes. But they lost him more
than he gained. Mr. Willkie should try delivering
speeches simple and frugal enough for the average
American to understand.

November election goes Republican with a few Demo
crats and Liberals thrown in for good measure. You've
heard, haven't you, about Hitler's holding a few plans
of his own for the world? Well, last Saturday, that
nasty Mr. Willkie upset the whole apple cart. Mr.
Willkie is a man of the peeple. First he ran his fingers
through his hair, then he picked a little wax from his
ear, and then he mouthed, "If you elect me Prezzdent
Uni' States, I pledge you a new world."
On rye bread, that would be swell.
* * * *
'J'HIS whole thing is remindful of a recent New Yorker
cartoon in which a laborer turns suddenly from
the radio to his wife working over a wash tub, and
says, "He just gave the world twenty-four hours to
get out." Don't you wonder where Willkie is going
to get that new world? Of course, the Republican
party and Mr. Willkie tell us that Mr. Willkie's powers
are limitless. But this thing has got to end somewhere.
Pledging a new world is almost as extreme as—as —as
pledging a new world.
Perhaps you think that that is stretching the point
too far, and that we are just quibbling over how many
angels can stand on the point of a pin. You're right;
its patterned after most of Mr. Willkie's speeches
which bulge at the seams with such succulent terms
as "liberal advance," "protect American enterprise,"
and "poverty and exploitation." Or do you like, "They
(Willkie's pledges) must be fulfilled in steel and con
crete, and in the flesh and blood of men"?
Read his speech, read all of it, and when you get
through, you will know no more than you did at the
first word. Of course, Mr. Willkie isn't expected to
present detailed plans of his policies in one speech.
But in his tour across the country he might have
hinted at them. People can't vote for American enter
prise or poverty and exploitation.

IN the same speech, Willkie said, and repeated, "The
American people admire simplicity. They are
frugal. They are honest."
It begins to look like he is correct. A recent con
versation with a representative of a polling company
uncovered that Mr. Willkie's speeches in San Fran
cisco gained him many votes. But they lost him more
than he gained. Mr. Willkie should try delivering
speeches simple and frugal enough for the average
American to understand.
YOU GOT PLENTY O' NOTHIN'
evci'y speech, Willkie appears to grow in his
ability to say more and, at the same time, say
less than any politician now blarney-storming around
the country.
After what Mr. Willkie shouted last Saturday at the
Empire City Race Track (of all places), he and Mr.
Hitler should soon be coming to blows; that is, if the
November election goes Republican with a few Demo
crats and Liberals thrown in for good measure. You've
heard, haven't you, about Hitler's holding a few plans
of his own for the world? Well, last Saturday, that
