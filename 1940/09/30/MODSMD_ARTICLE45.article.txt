r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
On behalf of the Rally Committee I want to
thank the students for the co-operation they gave us
during Saturday's game. The committee members
aren't supposed to be professional ushers or even come
close to it. So if you will bear with us in the future
games as well as you did Saturday, we'll appreciate it.
As some of you found out to your dismay, when
you arrived at the games there were no more seats in
the rooting section. I'm sorry that you had to sit in
the end zone, but the seating sort of follows a "first
come, first served" principle.
We II keep our fingers crossed and hope for more
of that needed co-operation between Rally Committee
and the students. Thanks again.
Bill Kimball
