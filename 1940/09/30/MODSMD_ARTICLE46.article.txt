# Poor Acting Runs Rampant In 'Wyoming'
## 
### 
"WYOMING," with Wallace Beery
and Leo Cariilo, now playing at
the Stanford Theater.
Someone once said that the poor
are always with us—the same might
be said of Wallace Beery. Just
when long-suffering audiences be
gin to believe that motion pictures
are raising their standards, along
comes another sentimental melo
drama built about Beery's inef
fable ability to act coy in an ele
phantine manner.
Properly, the verb "act" cannot
be applied to Beery's performances.
If grimacings, guttural mutterings,
and head scratching can be classed
as acting, we may expect to see u
Saint Bernard puppy win the Acad
emy award.
HORSE OPERA
This glorified horse opera deals
with the struggle of cattle. raisers
in early day Wyoming to free
Sweetwater Valley of a mob of
land-grabbing cattle thieves. The
settlers' part in the struggle con
sists mainly of gathering in sad
eyed little groups and solemnly
shaking their heads—until Beery
arrives.
Abandoning a career of small
scale train robbery when he in
advertently attempts to hold up a
train carrying a troop of Union
cavalry (it's just after the close of
the Civil War), the bungling bad
man is robbed of his horse and gun
by his partner Leo Cariilo.
Beery then hitches a ride to Wy
oming with a rancher who has
been serving in the War. In grati
tude, he steals his benefactor's horse
and gun. But he shows he doesn't
really mean it by coming back to
his side in time to see him killed
by a group of the above-mentioned
cattle-thieves.
Just an over-sized edition of
Peck's bad boy—that's Beery.
There's really a heart of gold un
derneath that unwashed exterior.
So he stays in Sweetwater Valley
to look after the orphaned children
of the deceased rancher, and rid
the valley of the desperadoes.
RUTHERFORD IN LOVE
Joseph Calleia plays the part of
the villain who is trying to steal
the cattle of the ranchers, then to
buy the land at his own price.
Bobs Watson is one of the or
phans, a freckle-faced small boy
who acts as a foil for Beery. Ann
Rutherford is the other orphan.
Her principal activity is falling in
love with a young army officer.
The producers didn't omit a sin
gle ingredient of the traditional
frontier picture. There are horses,
cattle, plenty of shooting, saloons,
Indians, and even General Custer
and the Seventh Cavalry.
If you want to relax for a couple
of hours, you might venture to at
tend this; but if you dislike stereo
typed stories and acting, it's not
worth the price of admission.
The other picture on the bill is
"Dr. Kildare Goes Home," in which
Lew Ayres, Lionel Barrymore and
John Shelton (a likely looking
newcomer) venture into an experi
ment with community medicine. It
has a fair plot, but the acting is
rather languid.—Douglass

man is robbed of his horse and gun
by his partner Leo Cariilo.
Beery then hitches a ride to Wy
oming with a rancher who has
been serving in the War. In grati
tude, he steals his benefactor's horse
and gun. But he shows he doesn't
really mean it by coming back to
his side in time to see him killed
by a group of the above-mentioned
cattle-thieves.
Just an over-sized edition of
Peck's bad boy—that's Beery.
There's really a heart of gold un
derneath that unwashed exterior.
So he stays in Sweetwater Valley
to look after the orphaned children
of the deceased rancher, and rid
the valley of the desperadoes.
RUTHERFORD IN LOVE
Joseph Calleia plays the part of
the villain who is trying to steal
the cattle of the ranchers, then to
buy the land at his own price.
Bobs Watson is one of the or
phans, a freckle-faced small boy
who acts as a foil for Beery. Ann
Rutherford is the other orphan.
Her principal activity is falling in
love with a young army officer.
The producers didn't omit a sin
gle ingredient of the traditional
frontier picture. There are horses,
cattle, plenty of shooting, saloons,
Indians, and even General Custer
and the Seventh Cavalry.
If you want to relax for a couple
of hours, you might venture to at
tend this; but if you dislike stereo
typed stories and acting, it's not
worth the price of admission.
The other picture on the bill is
"Dr. Kildare Goes Home," in which
Lew Ayres, Lionel Barrymore and
John Shelton (a likely looking
newcomer) venture into an experi
ment with community medicine. It
has a fair plot, but the acting is
rather languid.—Douglass
"WYOMING," with Wallace Beery
and Leo Cariilo, now playing at
the Stanford Theater.
Someone once said that the poor
are always with us—the same might
be said of Wallace Beery. Just
when long-suffering audiences be
gin to believe that motion pictures
are raising their standards, along
comes another sentimental melo
drama built about Beery's inef
fable ability to act coy in an ele
phantine manner.
Properly, the verb "act" cannot
be applied to Beery's performances.
If grimacings, guttural mutterings,
and head scratching can be classed
as acting, we may expect to see u
Saint Bernard puppy win the Acad
emy award.
HORSE OPERA
This glorified horse opera deals
with the struggle of cattle. raisers
in early day Wyoming to free
Sweetwater Valley of a mob of
land-grabbing cattle thieves. The
settlers' part in the struggle con
sists mainly of gathering in sad
eyed little groups and solemnly
shaking their heads—until Beery
arrives.
Abandoning a career of small
scale train robbery when he in
advertently attempts to hold up a
train carrying a troop of Union
cavalry (it's just after the close of
the Civil War), the bungling bad
man is robbed of his horse and gun
by his partner Leo Cariilo.
