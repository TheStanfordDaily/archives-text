WITH FRENCH INDO-CHINESE
ARMY IN THE FIELD, Monday,
Sept. 30 (UP). —French and Japa
nese armies in north Indo-China
faced each other today, their lines
several miles apart, with the French
occupying a position of considerable
natural defense strength.
I found the French forces concen
trated 70 miles northeast of the
capital, their line thrown across the
entrance to a valley with hills on
either flank.
There had been no fighting for
three days, the French officers said.
The only firing was from Japanese
"guerilla" bands which the French
said were roving the countryside.
Japanese planes occasionally flew
over the strong French positions.
BRIDGES DESTROYED
Both the railroad and highway
from northern Indo-China to Hanoi
run through the valley blocked by
the French, who have destroyed
both railway and highway bridges
leading into the valley.
At headquarters, French officers
lamented that the United States had
not released military planes to Indo-
China last June when they first were
requested.
The officers said that the loss of
Langson, important railway point a
few miles north, to the Japanese re
suited largely from order the French
had to hold their fire unless actually
attacked. This, they said, enabled
the Japanese virtually to surround
the city before launching their at
tack.
FRENCH ARE PRISONERS
They said native traitors acted as
guides for the Japanese. When the
attack came, Langson was unable to
hold out against terrific aerial and ar
tillery bombardments which de
stroyed French anti-tank emplace
ments. The officers said many
French were among the many pris
oners the Japanese took at Langson.
The French officers said the Japa
nese were busily distributing pam
phlets to Indo-Chinese natives ex
plaining Japan's plans for a "new
order' in East Asia and warning
them not to resist the Japanese
army.

Japanese planes occasionally flew
over the strong French positions.
BRIDGES DESTROYED
Both the railroad and highway
from northern Indo-China to Hanoi
run through the valley blocked by
the French, who have destroyed
both railway and highway bridges
leading into the valley.
At headquarters, French officers
lamented that the United States had
not released military planes to Indo-
China last June when they first were
requested.
The officers said that the loss of
Langson, important railway point a
few miles north, to the Japanese re
suited largely from order the French
had to hold their fire unless actually
attacked. This, they said, enabled
the Japanese virtually to surround
the city before launching their at
tack.
FRENCH ARE PRISONERS
They said native traitors acted as
guides for the Japanese. When the
attack came, Langson was unable to
hold out against terrific aerial and ar
tillery bombardments which de
stroyed French anti-tank emplace
ments. The officers said many
French were among the many pris
oners the Japanese took at Langson.
The French officers said the Japa
nese were busily distributing pam
phlets to Indo-Chinese natives ex
plaining Japan's plans for a "new
order' in East Asia and warning
them not to resist the Japanese
army.
