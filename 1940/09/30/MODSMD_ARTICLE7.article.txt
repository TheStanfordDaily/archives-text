# Bailey to Open Tuesday Series
## Foreign Policy to Be Subject Tomorrow 
### 
Discussing "American Foreign
Policies in a Changing World,"
Thomas A. Bailey, professor of his
tory, will open the Tuesday evening
series tomorrow night at 7:30 o'clock
in Memorial Hall.
Professor Bailey will review the
five fundamental foreign policies of
the United States: isolation (includ
ing non-intervention, neutrality, and
non-entanglement); freedom of the
seas (with the larger implications of
neutral rights); Pan-Americanism;
the Monroe Doctrine; and the Open
Door.
He will describe briefly the his
torical meaning of each of these
policies, and then devote the major
portion of his time showing how
each one has been strengthened or
weakened by the events of the past
few years, particularly since the out
break of World War 11. Special em
phasis will be given to events of the
last few weeks.
While on sabbatical leave last
year, Professor Bailey spent several
months in Washington, where he
gathered material in Department of
State and conversed with various
officials there. He will incorporate
this data into his lecture tomorrow
night.
