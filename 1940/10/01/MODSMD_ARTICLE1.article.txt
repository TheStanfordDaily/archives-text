JL'OR almost eight years Franklin
Roosevelt has been President of
the United States. November 5 the
people will decide whether Mr.
Roosevelt will be given another four
years in office.

Newspapers of the country have
scrutinized the President —his char
acter and his record—since the day
of his inauguration in March 1933.
The vast majority of newspapers
have found much fault with the
President and the reading public
knows thoroughly the President's
blackest side.

Recently, a book of some hun
dred pages, "Country Squire in the
White House," was published and
it quickly became a best seller in
Ihe non-fiction lists. In brief, the
book is a resume of the bitterest
criticisms of the President.

Wendell Willkie, the Republican
candidate, has been before the read
ing public for but four months, and
newspapers as a whole have pictured
him favorably. Many persons do not
know that he, like the President, can
be torn apart if the writer has this
as his purpose.

r J' , IIE New Rt-public published last
month with its regular issue a
supplement entitled, "This Man
Willkie." For the first time, a pe
riodical with something of a na
tional reputation printed a thorough
condemnation of the Republican
candidate.

For voters still on the fence—or
for anyone else—these two articles
will furnish interesting reading.
Both arc bitter in tone; and either
might be discarded hastily by a
voter who has already made his
choice.
Neither of the articles is scholarly,
but both are extremely readable.
Possible evidence of their vote-get
ting value is that the Republicans
have pushed "Country Squire in the
White House," while the Democrats
have sought to distribute the New
Republic supplement.

JOHN T. FLYNN, author of the
" attack on Roosevelt, contends
that the "mass of propaganda ... by
which the President has been built
into heroic proportions conceals
pretty thoroughly the man behind
the myth."
In his concluding chapter, Mr.
Flynn asserts:
"Seven years after he (Roose
velt) took office there are 11 mil
lion unemployed, private invest
ment is dead, the farm problem is
precisely where he found it. But
these social reforms have to be
almost completely overhauled. As
for recovery—the President has
not one plan. The cost of all this
has been 22 billion dollars, all yet
to be paid.
If it has all happened that way,
it is because Franklin D. Roosevelt
is that way."

r JPHE editors of the New Republic
describe Mr. Willkie's career
and personality in much the same
manner as Mr. Flynn describes the
President. According to their own
introduction the editors write:
"Thc.v (the editors) tell the
story of liow Commonwealth and
Southern stockholders took a loss
on paper of $750,000,000; of how
his southern companies fought the
TVA with injunctions, spite lines,
paid propaganda and whiskey at
elections; of how his Michigan
company tried to suppress a labor
union and tangled with the Labor
Hoard."

A reader may weigh both of these
articles and then become dismayed
at the evident incapacity of cither
candidate to hold office as President
of the United States. But the intel
ligent reader will take each with a
grain of salt.
Sifting through reams of campaign
material is no fun for the ordinary
voter. He wants to know the best
and the worst about each candidate.
Here in convenient form are sur
veys of the two major party candi
dates as viewed by writers who
give the darkest of the respective
men. Voters might well consider
these articles.

has been 22 billion dollars, all yet
to be paid.
If it has all happened that way,
it is because Franklin D. Roosevelt
is that way."

r JPHE editors of the New Republic
describe Mr. Willkie's career
and personality in much the same
manner as Mr. Flynn describes the
President. According to their own
introduction the editors write:
"Thc.v (the editors) tell the
story of liow Commonwealth and
Southern stockholders took a loss
on paper of $750,000,000; of how
his southern companies fought the
TVA with injunctions, spite lines,
paid propaganda and whiskey at
elections; of how his Michigan
company tried to suppress a labor
union and tangled with the Labor
Hoard."

A reader may weigh both of these
articles and then become dismayed
at the evident incapacity of cither
candidate to hold office as President
of the United States. But the intel
ligent reader will take each with a
grain of salt.
Sifting through reams of campaign
material is no fun for the ordinary
voter. He wants to know the best
and the worst about each candidate.
Here in convenient form are sur
veys of the two major party candi
dates as viewed by writers who
give the darkest of the respective
men. Voters might well consider
these articles.
JL'OR almost eight years Franklin
Roosevelt has been President of
the United States. November 5 the
people will decide whether Mr.
Roosevelt will be given another four
years in office.

Newspapers of the country have
scrutinized the President —his char
acter and his record—since the day
of his inauguration in March 1933.
The vast majority of newspapers
have found much fault with the
President and the reading public
knows thoroughly the President's
blackest side.

Recently, a book of some hun
dred pages, "Country Squire in the
White House," was published and
it quickly became a best seller in
Ihe non-fiction lists. In brief, the
book is a resume of the bitterest
criticisms of the President.

Wendell Willkie, the Republican
candidate, has been before the read
ing public for but four months, and
newspapers as a whole have pictured
him favorably. Many persons do not
know that he, like the President, can
be torn apart if the writer has this
as his purpose.

r J' , IIE New Rt-public published last
month with its regular issue a
supplement entitled, "This Man
Willkie." For the first time, a pe
riodical with something of a na
tional reputation printed a thorough
condemnation of the Republican
candidate.

For voters still on the fence—or
for anyone else—these two articles
will furnish interesting reading.
Both arc bitter in tone; and either
might be discarded hastily by a
voter who has already made his
choice.
Neither of the articles is scholarly,
but both are extremely readable.
Possible evidence of their vote-get
ting value is that the Republicans
have pushed "Country Squire in the
White House," while the Democrats
have sought to distribute the New
Republic supplement.

JOHN T. FLYNN, author of the
" attack on Roosevelt, contends
that the "mass of propaganda ... by
which the President has been built
into heroic proportions conceals
pretty thoroughly the man behind
the myth."
In his concluding chapter, Mr.
Flynn asserts:
"Seven years after he (Roose
velt) took office there are 11 mil
lion unemployed, private invest
ment is dead, the farm problem is
precisely where he found it. But
these social reforms have to be
almost completely overhauled. As
for recovery—the President has
not one plan. The cost of all this
has been 22 billion dollars, all yet
to be paid.
If it has all happened that way,
it is because Franklin D. Roosevelt
