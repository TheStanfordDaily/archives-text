# Men's Council Elects Cannon To Chair Left by Trowbridge
## 
### 
Men's Council elected Wilson Cannon, A.T.0., to chairmanship of the
group yesterday.
Cannon succeeds Roy Trowbridge, a Sequoia man, who in turn took
over from Burroughs Anderson last June. Trowbridge graduated with
the Class of '40 but had expected to return to school as a graduate student

>in engineering.
The election of a new chairman
was necessitated when Trowbridge
decided to accept a job instead of
returning to Stanford this year.
Election of a man to succeed him on
the Council will be held next
Tuesday.
Cannon will serve as Council head
until mid-year when his tenure of
office expires. Other officers include
Ed Stone, secretary; Jerry Mayer,
vice-president; and Hugh O'Don
nell, scrgeant-at-arms.
"The policies of this term's Coun
cil will not differ materially from
last year's," Cannon stated. "We will
continue to represent the student
body in a fair, just manner and will
handle all violations in the light of
the individual infraction."
