# Treasure Island Wrecking Starts
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Sept. 30 (UP).
Treasure Island, playland of the na
tion for two summers, tonight echoed
the sound of workmen's hammers as
Golden Gate International Exposi
tion exhibitors tore out their dis
plays to prepare the way for wreck
ing crews.
Contract specifications called for
complete demolishment of temporary
buildings by next June, leaving only
three permanent structures stand
ing. They are the Administration
Building, the Hall of Air Transpor
tation and the Palace of Fine Arts,
to be turned over to the Pan Ameri
can Airways, which will continue to
use the island as a port for its trans-
Pacific clippers.

Daily attendance .records were
broken yesterday when 211,020 per
sons jammed the island for a last
glimpse of the fair. Total attendance
for the 127-day 1940 season was
6,545,796 and for the 254-day 1939
season, 10,496.203 persons.
