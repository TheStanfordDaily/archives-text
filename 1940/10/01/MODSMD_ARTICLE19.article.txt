# R.A.F. Planes Blast Nazi Air Plant as British Guns Bombard 'Invasion Port'
## English Mystery Fighters Repulse German Attackers in Twenty-fourth Nightly Siege of Shattered London 
### 
LONDON, Sept. 30 (LP). —The Nazi-operated Fokker airplane plant nt
Amsterdam has been heavily blasted and set on fire hy British homberc,
the Air Ministry reported tonight after a destructive shelling of the
German "invasion port" of Calais hy British long-range guns.
Waves of British homhers, following up the long-range shelling and
a trans-Channel artillery duel, swept upon the French coast and bom-

barded the emplacements of the
Nazi "Big Bertha" guns with heavy
bombs whose detonations rocked th<>
English shore.
German anti-aircraft guns threw
up a fierce barrage against the Brit
ish bombers, whose attack began at
9 p.m., with the battered Calais
harbor and the '"Big Bertha" posi
tions around Cap Gris Nez as the
chief targets.
NEW ENGLISH PLANES
Meanwhile mysterious new
"Nighthawk" fighter planes, said to
be superior to anything Germany
possesses, early today beat German
raiders back from the sky over
central London amid a crashing
anti-aircraft barrage in the capital's
24th night of siege.
The Royal Air Force's Nighthawk
fighters, which the Daily Mail pre
dicted would go far toward break
ing the siege of London, battled Na/.i
raiders who ;ippeared in greater
numbers ov ihe central streets
than on previous nights.
British quarters boasted the new
fighters—soon to be operating in
daytime—and other new type de
fense planes will not only crush the
assaults on Britain but will carry
the war back across the Channel to
the European continent.
SUBURBS BOMBED
Last night the raiders smashed at
London s ring of suburbs, dropping
bombs on at least a dozen different
districts, and then came over the
heart of London where they were
met first by the blistering barrage
of the "Archies" and later by the
new British patrol planes.
In the first attack the Germans
crossed the coast near Dover and
bombed several towns including
Hastings and Bexhill, with a num
ber of casualties and some fatalities.
British fighter planes and anti-air
craft batteries shattered the forma
tions, the communique said.
Some 40 German planes attempted
the second raid. They crossed the
coast at Dungeness but RAF fight
ers and ground defenses turned
them back.
LONDON ATTACKED
During the third mass assault the
Germans broke through to the capi
tal. RAF fighters dispersed the for
mation but some of the German
planes crashed through to drop
bombs in the western suburbs.
The fourth alarm sounded latf* in
the day but no activity was appar
ent from central London.
The bombing of the Fokker
\lvorks at Amsterdam apparently
was the first time the British had
struck at this objective, one of the
world's largest aircraft plants,
which formerly supplied war and
commercial planes to 30 nations.
When the war broke out the Fok
ker works held the European lights
to manufacture and sell several fa
mous American types of bombers
and fighters, including Douglas
bombers.

Since the fall of Holland the Ger
mans have taken over operation of
the plant.
