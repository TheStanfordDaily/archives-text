at the following meeting will be
printed in a preceding issue of The
Daily. In addition the names and
addresses of the nine voting mem
bers of Excom will be printed in
order to enable contact with them
by interested students.
MAJORITY OPINION'
"Excom action should represent
only the opinion of the major por
tion of the student body," Miss
Townsend said. "Students should
feel free to present their opinions
at all times."
Her opinion was strongly sec
onded by Jessup, who at the same
time urged students to "get any
thing off your chest" that could
mean an improvement in student
body government.
