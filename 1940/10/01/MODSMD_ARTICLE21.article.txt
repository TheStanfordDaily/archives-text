# Night Cuts Short Search for Plane

### 
HELENA, Mont., Sept. 30 (UP). â€”
Darkness tonight forced abandon
ment of a search for an airplane, re
ported to have fallen in flames in
rugged mountain country near
Montana's famous Flying D Ranch.

Search was begun after a Montana
power company employe reported he
had seen a plane "go down in flames"
about two miles east of the Madison
River and 15 miles south of Bel
grade.
A commercial plane from Seattle
flew over the regular route but the
pilot said he failed to sight anything
that might have been a fallen air
craft.
