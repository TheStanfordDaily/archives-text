# Vivid Colors To Highlight 'She Stoops'
## Designer Emphasizes Elaborate Costuming In Goldsmith Comedy 
### 
Iligh wigs, 44-inch panniers and
outrageous colors will set the style
(or the 18th century costumes to be
leatured in the forthcoming "She
Stoops to Conquer," which will be
played in the main auditorium Fri
day and Saturday nights.
French fashions of the period of
Louis XVI, adapted to English cus
toms, complement the slapstick com
edy and practical jokes of the
country bumpkin sort, which Oliver
Goldsmith aptly used to caricature
the gentility of the landed English
gentry of the times, according to
Mrs. Helen Green, costume head.
Mrs. Hardcastle (Margery Bailey)
wears the most ridiculous costumes
designed to illustrate her snobbish
character. She wears a towering
wig made of horse hair for lightness
covered by a collapsible hood. Her
identifying colors are bright pur
ples, orchids and magentas. She is
(-(instantly over-dressed, as are most
of those playing comedy parts.
Sets for the play had to be height
ened and widened to accommodate
the width of the skirts and the
height of the wigs, topped by exces
sive hats. Mr. Hardcastle in direct
contrast to his wife insists on being
old-fashioned in dress, even to
wearing a wig of his grandfather's
era so that he will be different from
any other gentleman.
Lorgnettes, pipes and fans are
used with abandon to portray the
coquettish manners of the day, while
lavish costuming shows the con
scientious attempt of the English to
copy the elaborate fashions of the
French court.
