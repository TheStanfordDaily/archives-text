### 

AMERICAN LEGION and Canadian Legion exchange flags and 16.000 watch on the 150 th anniversary of
the conception of the Canada-U. S. border, in ceremonies at the Peace Arch at Blaine. Wash. There have
never been any guns along this great borderâ€”one of the few such borders in a troubled world.
