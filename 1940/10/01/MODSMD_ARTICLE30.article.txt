"HIE WANTED WAR." by Otto I). Tolischus. Rcynal & Hitchcock. $3.
Mr. .Tolischus' publishers announce his book as ". . . the most complete
and authoritative account of Hitler's Reich yet written." From its pub
licity. this reviewer was lead to believe tliat 'They Wanted War" was an
account of the rise of National Socialism in Germany and the psychological.

and economic sources
from which the Nazi movement
draws its life blood. The author is
1940 winner of the Nobel Prize for
foreign news reporting and until
May was Berlin correspondent for
the New York Times.
In case anyone who has not yet
read the book might have the same
expectations, let us say that it is an
interesting, even if somewhat in
complete, account of Adolf Hitler's
rise, with a chapter on the economic
system of modern Germany and a
chapter each on art, religion, and re
armament in Germany.
A pertinent, and outside of Ger
many, probably a disliked observa
tion by the author is the connec
tion between National Socialism and
the music of Richard Wagner.
Says Tolischus: " 'Whoever wants
to understand National Socialist
Germany must know Wagner,' Adolf
Hitler has often told his friends; and
the whole National Socialist regime,
which finds its foundation in the
Germanic myths and the cult of the
heroic, is in fact unthinkable with
[ out Wagnei and all he represents. In
that sense the whole present war re
solves itself into a super-Wagnerian
opera turned into grim reality."
Nietzsche, the exponent of the
ideal of the Superman and the Will
j to Power philosophy, and Wagner,
| the advocate of a return to Ger
i many's historic, medieval past in
1 German art were close friends and
mutual admirers at one period in
their lives and believed sincerely in
each other's philosophy. Hitler,
though born too late to know either
oi these men personally, has devel
oped a philosophy which draws
from both Wagnerian and Nietzsche
an sources.
There is a possibility that the ideas
! of Wagner, Nietzsche, and Hitler in
the fields of music, philosophy, and
politics are closely related. Fortu
nately for Wagner, music is more
beautiful than politics.
The most viid account in ''They
Wanted War" is that of the campaign
in Poland last year, republished
from the author's dispatches to the
New York Times and contained in
the appendices. The book's title re
fers to the theme of a speech deliv
ered by Hitler after the outbreak of
the war.—Adams

"HIE WANTED WAR." by Otto I). Tolischus. Rcynal & Hitchcock. $3.
Mr. .Tolischus' publishers announce his book as ". . . the most complete
and authoritative account of Hitler's Reich yet written." From its pub
licity. this reviewer was lead to believe tliat 'They Wanted War" was an
account of the rise of National Socialism in Germany and the psychological.

and economic sources
from which the Nazi movement
draws its life blood. The author is
1940 winner of the Nobel Prize for
foreign news reporting and until
May was Berlin correspondent for
the New York Times.
In case anyone who has not yet
read the book might have the same
expectations, let us say that it is an
interesting, even if somewhat in
complete, account of Adolf Hitler's
rise, with a chapter on the economic
system of modern Germany and a
chapter each on art, religion, and re
armament in Germany.
A pertinent, and outside of Ger
many, probably a disliked observa
tion by the author is the connec
tion between National Socialism and
the music of Richard Wagner.
Says Tolischus: " 'Whoever wants
to understand National Socialist
Germany must know Wagner,' Adolf
Hitler has often told his friends; and
the whole National Socialist regime,
which finds its foundation in the
Germanic myths and the cult of the
heroic, is in fact unthinkable with
[ out Wagnei and all he represents. In
that sense the whole present war re
solves itself into a super-Wagnerian
opera turned into grim reality."
