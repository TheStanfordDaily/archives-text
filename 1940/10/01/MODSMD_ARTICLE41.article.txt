# Cards Return to Practice Minus Albert, Warnecke
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity grid team not
only showed that they play a razzle
dazzle effective game of football and
that they are a rejuvenated outfit
from end to end in their successful
season's opener against U.S.F., they
also proved they were in better
physical condition than most teams
roach during an entire season.
Only two members of the squad
were not in uniform for yesterday's
practice and both of them were
resting from strictly minor injuries
and will be ready for practice today.
They were Frankie Albert, first
string quarterback, who was nursing
a charley horse, and Jack Warnecke,
regular tackle, who was laid up
since the game with stomach trouble.
It seems that just after the game
ended Jack was so badly bothered
by pains in his side that team phy
sician Dr. Davies feared an emer
gency appendicitis operation, but the
pains disappeared and Jack took it
easy yesterday merely as a precau
tionary measure.
CONCENTRATES ON JEFFREY
Yesterday's workout saw the third
and fourth-stringers who saw only
little action last Saturday going j
through some contact work. Coach j
Clark Shaughnessy seemed to con
centrate on Clyde Jeffrey, the fastest |
man in a football suit in America
today.
"Jiffy Jeff," captain of Stanford's
world record breaking track team
of last year and the nation's out
standing sprinter, is learning foot
ball the tough way—from the ground
up, with plenty of bangs and bruises.
But Jeff is one of the hardest and
most willing workers out there and
at his present rate of improvement
will develop into a potent weapon
lor the Shaughnessy system. Yes
terday, on one of those quick open
ers which were so deadly against !
U.S.F., he tore 50 yards to a touch- j
down.
ROLL THROUGH PRACTICE
Meanwhile the first two strings j
lolled through signal practice agamst |
the blocking and tackling dummies, j
Ray Hammett and Ed Stamm filled :
iif for the injured Albert and War
necke, respectively.
Yesterday also saw the return to j
action of chunky Ed McCain, last j
year's first-string freshman guard, j
Just as outstanding as his team- I
mates of last year, Bruno Banducci, \
Dick Palmer, and Chuck Taylor, I
who won their spurs in varsity com- j
petition in the rout of the Dons, Ed I
has a good chance of working up
among the regulars and being just j
as much an asset as these other j
three sophomores.

If not today, then tomorrow, the
varsity will start to hear a few things
about Oregon, their next and first
conference rival which will visit
Palo Alto next Saturday. The var
sity's informer concerning the Web
feet, who turned back the San Diego
Marines 12-2 in their opener, will be
Assistant Coach Phil Bengston, who
i!ew to the Friday night game and
arrived back at Kezar Stadium just
five minutes before the Stanford-
U.S.F. kickoff.

ROLL THROUGH PRACTICE
Meanwhile the first two strings j
lolled through signal practice agamst |
the blocking and tackling dummies, j
Ray Hammett and Ed Stamm filled :
iif for the injured Albert and War
necke, respectively.
Yesterday also saw the return to j
action of chunky Ed McCain, last j
year's first-string freshman guard, j
Just as outstanding as his team- I
mates of last year, Bruno Banducci, \
Dick Palmer, and Chuck Taylor, I
who won their spurs in varsity com- j
petition in the rout of the Dons, Ed I
has a good chance of working up
among the regulars and being just j
as much an asset as these other j
three sophomores.

If not today, then tomorrow, the
varsity will start to hear a few things
about Oregon, their next and first
conference rival which will visit
Palo Alto next Saturday. The var
sity's informer concerning the Web
feet, who turned back the San Diego
Marines 12-2 in their opener, will be
Assistant Coach Phil Bengston, who
i!ew to the Friday night game and
arrived back at Kezar Stadium just
five minutes before the Stanford-
U.S.F. kickoff.
Stanford's varsity grid team not
only showed that they play a razzle
dazzle effective game of football and
that they are a rejuvenated outfit
from end to end in their successful
season's opener against U.S.F., they
also proved they were in better
physical condition than most teams
roach during an entire season.
Only two members of the squad
were not in uniform for yesterday's
practice and both of them were
resting from strictly minor injuries
and will be ready for practice today.
They were Frankie Albert, first
string quarterback, who was nursing
a charley horse, and Jack Warnecke,
regular tackle, who was laid up
since the game with stomach trouble.
It seems that just after the game
ended Jack was so badly bothered
by pains in his side that team phy
sician Dr. Davies feared an emer
gency appendicitis operation, but the
pains disappeared and Jack took it
easy yesterday merely as a precau
tionary measure.
CONCENTRATES ON JEFFREY
Yesterday's workout saw the third
and fourth-stringers who saw only
little action last Saturday going j
through some contact work. Coach j
Clark Shaughnessy seemed to con
centrate on Clyde Jeffrey, the fastest |
man in a football suit in America
today.
"Jiffy Jeff," captain of Stanford's
world record breaking track team
of last year and the nation's out
standing sprinter, is learning foot
ball the tough way—from the ground
up, with plenty of bangs and bruises.
But Jeff is one of the hardest and
most willing workers out there and
at his present rate of improvement
will develop into a potent weapon
lor the Shaughnessy system. Yes
terday, on one of those quick open
ers which were so deadly against !
U.S.F., he tore 50 yards to a touch- j
down.
