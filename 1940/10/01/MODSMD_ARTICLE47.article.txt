# Frosh Prepare For San Mateo
## 
### 
Any ideas Harry Shipkey had
about sending his squad through a
1 tough scrimmage yesterday were
I tossed to the winds as laboratory
work kept a good many of the frosh
j gridders in the classroom until after
! 4 o'clock.
The yearlings meet San Mateo
| J. C. Saturday in the Stadium.
Late in the afternoon two outfits,
picked from among the boys who
did get to the practice field, went
through a light punt scrimmage.
The remainder of the practice ses
; sion was taken up by wind sprints.
The first eleven yesterday was
manned by Jim Ellis and Bill Norse
at ends, Jean LaMoure and Dick
Abrams at tackles, Bill Josslyn and
Matt Petrlich at guards, Loren La
' Prade at center, Jack Reynolds at
; quarter, Bob Mitchell and Bob Kock
lat halves, and Randall Fawcctt at
j full.
The opposing team v/as made up
I of Bill Brubaker and Bud Madden
j at ends, Harold Petrick and Jim Cox
, at tackles, Kelly Ross and Darwin
Seely at guards, Frank Heid at cen-
I ter, and Jim Troup, Keith Pinion,
, Lee Scott, and Harry Reichling in
the .backfield.
Having given his outfit lots of con
; tact work last week, Coach Shipkey
plans to ease up a little 1 his week,
spending most of the practice ses
sions on polishing Ihe Papoose run
ning attack. However, a light pass
I scrum is on tap for this afternoon.
I Friday will probably see an easy
workout on kickoffs and kickoff
I returns.
