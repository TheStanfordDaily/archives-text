marked time before squaring off in
the opening game Wednesday at
Crosley Field before a sell-out crowd
of nearly 33.000.
Managers Bill McKechnie of the 1
Reds and Del Baker of the Tigers j
haven't named their pitchers yet, but !

20 and 12. versus Schoolboy Rowe,
Tigers, 16 and 3.
Second game — Bucky Walters,
Reds, 22 and 9, versus Buck New
som. Tigers, 21 and 5.
