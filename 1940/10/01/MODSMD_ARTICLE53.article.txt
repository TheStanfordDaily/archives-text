COAST CLEAN-I P
IfURTS GRID GAME
Those who protested against the
Atherton regime being installed to
clean up coast athletics on the
â–  ground that it would hurt Pacific
| supremacy in athletics, and espe
j cially that of the conference, seem
| to be vindicated. Results of the
week-end's intersectional festivities
aren't very favorable to P.C.C.
teams.
In case you haven't been reading
I the papers over the week-end, here's
hqw three coast teams fared against
j outside opponents.
Washington 14, Minnesota 1!)
California 0. Michigan -11
U.C.L.A. (i. Southern Methodist J)
Not too encouraging, is it? But
let's take a closer look. In the first
game, the Huskies favored to take
the P.C.C. crown, the Gophers not
rated as potent as of old, Far West
ern football wound up on the wrong
end. Why?
Probably because Bernie Bierman's
Minnesota club was underrated due
to the fact that some importance
rested on whether some key sopho
mores came through. Evidently they
did, and the Gophers cashed in on
some Huskie mistakes to take a close
ball game that could have gone the
other way.
About the Berkeley Debacle, not
much need be said but Tommy
Harmon's a great back and Cal
appears even weaker than ex
pected. may have to hustle to stay
| out of the Conference cellar.
In Los Angeles Friday night a team
that figures to finish one-two in its
league deteated a team that at pres
ent doesn't appear to be headed any
higher thaVi third, a team that has
lost one of the greatest backs to per
form on any gridiron, Kenny Wash
ington.
On the whole, it may not be as
bad as it loks. Personally, I am one
who would like to see the Rose Bowl

frame played between the Coast
and Big Nine conference winners.
II a national champion didn't come
out ot that game something is amiss,
because these two leagues really
play tough ball.
WEBFEET MENTOR
WATCHES INDIANS
Tex Oliver, University of Ore
gon head coach, flew down from
Eugene to watch the unveiling of
tlie Shaughnessy system in Kezar
Saturday, and went home shaking
his head. Tex has only a week to
prepare his squad to come up
against the new Big Red Machine,
but lie's a very foxy coach, and if
anyone can cook up a defense to
stop the wide open Indian offense,
he can.
And don't be fooled by the fact
that Oregon only defeated the San
Diego Marines by a 12-2 count. The
game was played in the rain Friday
night, and the Ducks undoubtedly
kept their fancy stuff well under
cover.
Besides, we understand that the
Leathernecks have one very stub
born ball club, and that several
former college stars were in the line
up. One of these was Johnny Ry
land. Ryland was a flash center
with the U.C.L.A. Bruins not so long
ago, is now playing third-string pivot
man for the Marines.

It has come to our ears that the
U.S.F. line did not play what one
would call a clean game Saturday.
In years gone by that would have
led to two or three good brawls
during the course of the after
noon, hut this year's Indians just
banged away and won the football
game.
