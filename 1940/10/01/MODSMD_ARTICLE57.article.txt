THE door is open.
This declaration phrased by A.S.S.U. Presi
dent Bruce Jessup inaugurates, or at least makes
public, a new procedure for Stanford's Execu
tive Committee. Tonight the door will be open
—wide open. And every Farm student, pro
vided he can find space to sit or stand in the
committee's chambers, may witness the regu
lar weekly meeting of the student governing
board.
In a sense Excom has always been open to
the members of the student body. But never
before has the University's chief student ad
ministrator welcomed members of the Stanford
Family to attend and participate in the evening's
discussion.
Tonight's meeting should be an average and
thoroughly typical one. Several reasonably im
portant issues will be debated. First item on
the docket may be The Daily's advocated re
vision of the A.S.S.U.'s Constitution and By-
Laws with a view to creating an always-timely,
constantly correct document.

Additional material may be introduced on
the Activities Card File, placed on trial last
week when its results were analyzed and found
worthless. And discussion will proceed on
the Big Game Dance, the Co-operative Book
Exchange, and campus social regulations. Anne
Townsend will handle the Date Book.

Tonight's gathering should prove a uniquely
democratic occasion—if Stanford students are
sufficiently concerned with issues to spend an
hour or two to hear them debated, add a word
or two of comment. And Bruce Jessup may
have to dust off the S.R.O. signs and post them
at the portals of Old Union.
