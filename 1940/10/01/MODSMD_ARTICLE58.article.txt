THE DAILY is a diehard, at least as far as
campaigns go. A few short months ago the
readers of these columns were urged to con
sider seriously the possibility of nominating
non-athletes for the position of student member
of the Board of Athletic Control.

The proposal received about as much success
as a W.C.T.U. campaign in Reno.
Today and tomorrow nomination blanks will
be turned in to Election Chairman Betty Moses
for voting next Tuesday on three student body
positions which found themselves vacant when
their occupants failed to return to school for
the current academic year. The political posts
to be filled are graduate man on Executive
Committee, Men's Council member—and stu
dent representative on the B.A.C.
A succinct explanation of the B.A.C. mem
bership might give the voters a clue to the
importance the latter position plays in the man
agement of Stanford's athletic affairs. There
are nine members on the B.A.C.—three faculty
representatives, three alumni, and three stu
dents. Two of the student members are elected
by the student body, while the President of
the A.S.S.U. is automatically the third under
graduate representative.

In other words, in all matters of athletic pol
icy, the students have equal voice with Stan
lord's alumni and faculty. The fact that their
voice has been inarticulate over past years
could possibly be attributed to a number of
reasons—unfamiliarity with the devious prob
lems the Board passes upon, lack of information
on the topics under discussion, or, and here we
point our accusing finger, because of psycho
logical coercion resulting from their dependent
positions as scholarship athletes.

For both Hall and Row caucuses invariably
nominate athletes for the B.A.C. position; prob
ably on the theory that athletes are better quali
fied to understand the intricate problems of the
Board.

But while this may be good logic at a cursory
glance, there are other considerations involved.
For instance, most of these athletes are physical
education majors who are allowed to receive
an education because of scholarships awarded
on the basis of their athletic prowess. Their
present academic careers and coaching futures
are wrapped up in Stanford's Department of
Physical Education.
They would find themselves in the delicate
situation of a tight-rope walker on a piece of

greased string if they should oppose any meas
ure proposed or backed by the Department of
Physical Education.

Of course, no one believes that the physical
education staff would outwardly coerce these
students, but as long as the psychological bar
rier to speak and vote independently is present,
the Board is not balanced. There is in effect an
importent minority.

The men who will be nominated today and
tomorrow can be athletes, but there is no reason
why they necessarily have to be. There is no
reason for believing that a non-athlete couldn't
make every bit as good—if not better—a B.A.C.
member. Furthermore, the latter could take a
detached, impersonal view of the proceedings
that would be impossible for an athlete to take.

Physical Education.
They would find themselves in the delicate
situation of a tight-rope walker on a piece of

greased string if they should oppose any meas
ure proposed or backed by the Department of
Physical Education.

Of course, no one believes that the physical
education staff would outwardly coerce these
students, but as long as the psychological bar
rier to speak and vote independently is present,
the Board is not balanced. There is in effect an
importent minority.

The men who will be nominated today and
tomorrow can be athletes, but there is no reason
why they necessarily have to be. There is no
reason for believing that a non-athlete couldn't
make every bit as good—if not better—a B.A.C.
member. Furthermore, the latter could take a
detached, impersonal view of the proceedings
that would be impossible for an athlete to take.

THE DAILY is a diehard, at least as far as
campaigns go. A few short months ago the
readers of these columns were urged to con
sider seriously the possibility of nominating
non-athletes for the position of student member
of the Board of Athletic Control.

The proposal received about as much success
as a W.C.T.U. campaign in Reno.
Today and tomorrow nomination blanks will
be turned in to Election Chairman Betty Moses
for voting next Tuesday on three student body
positions which found themselves vacant when
their occupants failed to return to school for
the current academic year. The political posts
to be filled are graduate man on Executive
Committee, Men's Council member—and stu
dent representative on the B.A.C.
A succinct explanation of the B.A.C. mem
bership might give the voters a clue to the
importance the latter position plays in the man
agement of Stanford's athletic affairs. There
are nine members on the B.A.C.—three faculty
representatives, three alumni, and three stu
dents. Two of the student members are elected
by the student body, while the President of
the A.S.S.U. is automatically the third under
graduate representative.

In other words, in all matters of athletic pol
icy, the students have equal voice with Stan
lord's alumni and faculty. The fact that their
voice has been inarticulate over past years
could possibly be attributed to a number of
reasons—unfamiliarity with the devious prob
lems the Board passes upon, lack of information
on the topics under discussion, or, and here we
point our accusing finger, because of psycho
logical coercion resulting from their dependent
positions as scholarship athletes.

For both Hall and Row caucuses invariably
nominate athletes for the B.A.C. position; prob
ably on the theory that athletes are better quali
fied to understand the intricate problems of the
Board.

But while this may be good logic at a cursory
glance, there are other considerations involved.
For instance, most of these athletes are physical
education majors who are allowed to receive
an education because of scholarships awarded
on the basis of their athletic prowess. Their
present academic careers and coaching futures
are wrapped up in Stanford's Department of
Physical Education.
