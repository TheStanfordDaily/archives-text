# BULL SESSION
## THE
						LEAN YEARS HAVE PASSED 
### BUD AMES 
YESTERDAY morning something happened in the
Cellar that hasn't occurred for years. Yesterday
was Monday. And a Stanford student was actually
seen reading the Monday morning sport section of a
San Francisco newspaper. During the past couple of
years Stanfordites haven't cared much about reading
the gory details.
To make the incident doubly momentous, the reader
was a woman, her face twisted with smiles. The happi
ness bug seems to have bitten everyone down on the
Farm.
Such was hardly the case just a few minutes before
the game with U.S.F. last Saturday. Remember when
the head yell leader from Utah came over and said,
"We wanta thank you for being so swell and cheerin'
for us. We feel kinda bad about this game; anyway,
thanks a lot."
Perhaps you didn't hear him, but from somewhere
in the center of the Stanford rooting section, a husky
voiced student yelled back, "Stick around, bud; we'll
probably need your help."
Those within sound of his voice chuckled. They
had become used to laughing at such vitriolic jokes
during the past two years.

was before the opening kickoff. With the
first play something seemed to grip the Stanford
rooting section. They yelled themselves hoarse. Stu
dents who heard the game broadcast over the radio
thrilled as time and time again the announcer said,
"I've never heard a rooting section like that Stanford
one. They never seem to stop yelling. After they've
given yells for everyone on their team, they start giv
ing some for the University of San Francisco."
Stanford students went mentally berserk. One
male, sitting happily with a hot dog, bubbled and
jumbled his words excitedly as the Red Machine pow
ered to its first touchdown. All that came out was,
"Gee, ain't football season great. There's nothing like
a foot dog and hot ball."

the Stanford family is plenty happy. You know,
it really is. This little incident expresses the whole
Stanford idea. When Shaughnessy substituted a com
plete new team, our head yell leader, Gordy Nicoll,
began checking off the players coming off the field.
First it was "Butch Jones, rah." Then it was "Bill
Smith, rah. After about the fourth cheer, a voice
from the rooting section suddenly blared, "Never mind
all the rest, Gordy; we'll see them on the Quad Mon
day morning."

And it's warming when you idealize that you know
everybody else. Few other universities could make
that last statement.
