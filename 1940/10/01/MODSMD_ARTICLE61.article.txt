## WHO MISSED THE BOAT? 
### 
rpHE EDITOR, SIR:
Stanford, as I remember, has a hymn, tradi
tionally sung after football games by the entire rooting
section standing with hats removed.
The hymn used to be sung after every game,
whether we won or not. And if ever there was reason
to sing the hymn, it was after last Saturday's mar
velous spectacle which ended the Farm's grid famine.
But neither Rally Committee, the yell leaders, nor
the band made any attempt to have the hymn sung.
It has been so long since we won a game and had
occasion to cross the field to the opponents' rooting
section that most people forget whether the hymn
should be sung before or after we make a victory pil
grimage across the field.
However, as the U.S.F. rooting section sang their
hymn while we shouted at them from the field, then
it seems would have been a logical time for the band
to have started our hymn.
Whoever was responsible for this omission, cer
tainly should see to it that by next week-end arrange
ments are made to sing the hymn at the Oregon
game.
A great many people who listen to the games over
the radio wait for and expect to hear the rooting sec
tions fill the air with the solemn tones of the college
hymns following each game.
Here's hoping for next week.
