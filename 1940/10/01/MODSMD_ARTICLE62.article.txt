# MORE ON THE TROJANS

### 
'T'HE EDITOR. SIR:
This is in protest against the petty—and very
childish—mud-slinging which appeared in "Bull Ses
sion" recently. Though we may feel superior intel
lectually to U.S.C. and their athletes, please let's not
stoop to the point of tearing them down in our Daily.
I'm confident that I'm not alone in this sentiment.
Sincerely,
Colin McClintock
