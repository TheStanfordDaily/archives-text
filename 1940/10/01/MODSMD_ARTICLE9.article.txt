# Prof. Bailey To Analyze World Crisis
## First Lecture Series Program to Feature Prominent Historian 
### 
Thomas A. Bailey, professor of his
tory, will open Stanford's Tuesday
Evening Series tonight speaking on
"American Foreign Policies in a
Changing World." The lecture be
gins at 7:30 o'clock in the Auditorium
of the Memorial Hall.
Professor Bailey received nation
wide mention of his book, "A Diplo
matic History of the American
People," in Time, weekly newsmag
azine. The review was placed under
National Affairs instead of in the
Book preview section, as is custo
mary.
ARTICLE QUOTED
"Until last week plain readers had
no rapid up-to-the-minute survey
of United' States diplomatic histox-y
to place such moves in historical per
spective," the article read. The move
referred to was when the United
States and 20 other American Re
publics joined in protest to France,
Germany, and Great Britain against
violation of the 33-mile safety
zone.
'Last week," the book was pub
lished in December, 1939, "Stanford
Professor Thomas Bailey brought
out 'A Diplomatic History of the
American People'," the article con
tinued. "It. begins with an account
of the colonial foreign policy and
ends with the present Roosevelt Neu
trality proclamation and a retrospect
and prospect. But its best feature is
that it makes diplomatic history
lively reading."
SUPPLEMENTS WAR
Tonight Professor Bailey will not
only discuss the events mentioned in
his book, but he will supplement
his book by giving special emphasis
to events since the outbreak of
World War 11.
He will present the five funda
mental foreign policies of the United
States: the Open Door, the Monroe
Doctrine, Pan-Americanism, free
dom of the seas (with the larger im
plications of neutral rights), and
isolation (including non-interven
tion, neutrality, and non-entangle
ment).
COLLECTS MATERIAL
Professor Bailey took a sabbatical
leave last year and gathered mate
rial on the subject from the De
partment of State and from direct
contact with officials in Washington,
D.C. The University invites all
students to attend the lecture and
all following features of the series,
for which there is no charge.
October 8 Nicol Smith will give an
illustrated lecture on "The Burma
Road." Sir Hubert Wilkins, distin
guished explorer and diplomat, will
speak October 15 on "Next Steps
toward Civilization."
