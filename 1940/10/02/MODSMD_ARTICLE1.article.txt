up in her efforts to stop Ameri
can aid to Britain. Yesterday's news
from Berlin indicates that German
propagandists will continue their
attempts to intimidate the American
public.
Last week Berlin proclaimed that
it had something momentous to dis
close. A day later a new Italo-Ger
man-Japanese military alliance was
made public. The United States
was supposed to become frightened
and eventually back down in its firm
stand in the Far East and in its aid
to Britain.
Yesterday, one of the most au
thoritative Nazi organs, tho Ham
burger Fremdenblatt, predicted
that Russia was about to turn its
back on Britain entirely and enter
a new "Euro-Asian power bloc."
This bloc will be directed, the pa
per said, not only against Great
Britain but also against "certain
other interventionist circles,"
which means clearly the United
States.
Meanwhile, Diplomatic Political
Correspondence, a semi-official or
gan of the German Foreign Office,
said that the recently signed three
party pact should indicate "to the
strong, influential clique of inter
ventionists . . . the risk involved in
their interventionist plans."
Another more or less semi-official
organ, the Boerson Zeitung, blasted
Under-Secretary of State Sumner
Welles' statement of a few days ago
that Britain was fighting a "defen
sive war."
$ * *
such statements in
the German press would war
rant little comment from America.
But for many months the German
press seemingly has sought to ap
pease American opinion by refrain
ing from direct attacks on the
United States. Newspaper blasts by
American newspapers and high offi
cials have gone seemingly unnoticed
in the Nazi press.
But now there is a new plan—a
plan that sounds like a warning to
America. Quotations from Nazi
newspapers, like the ones printed
here, are excellent Nazi propa
ganda for Americans earnestly de
sirous of peace. The Germans want
Americans to believe that a firm
stand in the Far East and aid to
Britain will lead us to war.

/ 'ONGRESS yesterday okayed what
4 appeared to be the last piece of
controversial defense legislation—a
bill designed to prevent the creation
of "war millionaires" and to raise
a billion dollars in new revenue.
This last bill is a complicated tax
measure which the laymen, to say
nothing of many Congressmen, can
not hope to comprehend. But the
Congress has evidently finished its
defense business in spite of obstacles
of one kind or another all summer.

Although Congress has prac
tically completed anticipated busi
ness for the present session, it ap
peared probable that it will not
adjourn during the international
crisis. The probability that Con
gress will remain in session has
been strengthened since the belli
cose statements from Tokyo and
Berlin during the past few days.
Congressional leaders know that
final responsibility in maintaining
peace rests with them. Only Con
gress can declare war.
With Republicans and many con
servative Democrats pledged to vote
against adjournment, Congress may
adopt a plan whereby three-day re
cesses will be in order until after
the November 5 election. Technical
ly, Congress will be in session by
such a plan, but there will be little,
if any, formal business.

Although Congress has prac

ness for the present session, it ap
peared probable that it will not
adjourn during the international
crisis. The probability that Con
gress will remain in session has
been strengthened since the belli
cose statements from Tokyo and
Berlin during the past few days.
Congressional leaders know that
final responsibility in maintaining
peace rests with them. Only Con
gress can declare war.
With Republicans and many con
servative Democrats pledged to vote
against adjournment, Congress may
adopt a plan whereby three-day re
cesses will be in order until after
the November 5 election. Technical
ly, Congress will be in session by
such a plan, but there will be little,
if any, formal business.

from Berlin indicates that German
propagandists will continue their
attempts to intimidate the American
public.
Last week Berlin proclaimed that
it had something momentous to dis
close. A day later a new Italo-Ger
man-Japanese military alliance was
made public. The United States
was supposed to become frightened
and eventually back down in its firm
stand in the Far East and in its aid
to Britain.
Yesterday, one of the most au
thoritative Nazi organs, tho Ham
burger Fremdenblatt, predicted
that Russia was about to turn its
back on Britain entirely and enter
a new "Euro-Asian power bloc."
This bloc will be directed, the pa
per said, not only against Great
Britain but also against "certain
other interventionist circles,"
which means clearly the United
States.
Meanwhile, Diplomatic Political
Correspondence, a semi-official or
gan of the German Foreign Office,
said that the recently signed three
party pact should indicate "to the
strong, influential clique of inter
ventionists . . . the risk involved in
their interventionist plans."
Another more or less semi-official
organ, the Boerson Zeitung, blasted
Under-Secretary of State Sumner
Welles' statement of a few days ago
that Britain was fighting a "defen
sive war."

such statements in
the German press would war
rant little comment from America.
But for many months the German
press seemingly has sought to ap
pease American opinion by refrain
ing from direct attacks on the
United States. Newspaper blasts by
American newspapers and high offi
cials have gone seemingly unnoticed
in the Nazi press.
But now there is a new plan—a
plan that sounds like a warning to
America. Quotations from Nazi
newspapers, like the ones printed
here, are excellent Nazi propa
ganda for Americans earnestly de
sirous of peace. The Germans want
Americans to believe that a firm
stand in the Far East and aid to
Britain will lead us to war.

nothing of many Congressmen, can
not hope to comprehend. But the
