# Excom Hears Extensive Plans for Improvement Of Activity Card Files
## New Procedure Calls for Index Of All Students 
### M. J. MONTGOMERY 
As Betty Avery and Jim Mack
told Ex Committee last night,
their plans for replacing the pres
ent unworkable activity files, the
committee indicated it would sup
port the new system by legisla
tion requiring committee heads to
use the files and report the com
petency of committeemen.
The streamlined file will include
every undergraduate member of the
Associated Students—each to be rep
resented by a card made out in per
sonal interview by living group
president or sponsors.
Betty Avery indicated that the
new files would be in working order
in three weeks; they will be sub
mitted to Ex Committee for ap
proval at that time.
BIG GAME DANCE
While the selection of a band for
the second annual Big Game Dance
hangs fire, Cardinals Chairman Ned
Pugh last night named the San
Francisco Country Club as the ten
tative choice of Bob Beckham's
dance committee. The club's capac
ity necessitates limiting the dance to
300 bids to be sold at last year's
price of $5.
THANK YOU NOTE: The Asso
ciated Students have a new doll —
Miss Stanford from Nippon. She
will be introduced to the campus in
the library this week, wearing her
oriental kimono and coiffure combed
by Student Body Vice-President
Anne Townsend.
Kay Kitagawa, delegate to the
seventh American-Japanese student
conference, presented the doll to Ex
ecutive Committee, requesting that
after her reception in the Li be this
week she be entrusted to Dr. Allen
for safekeeping.
PEACE DAY: Considering the 1940
significance of Peace Day as molded
by world developments and condi
tions in the United States, Ex Com
mittee last night questioned the
policy of continuing the annual
event on the grounds that it might
be interpreted by outsiders as un
patriotic.
Warning the committee against
possible misinterpretation of a peace
program, Bob Low said, "Both Com
munist. and Nazi groups are trying
to promote just such programs."
The committee felt that any reac
tion would depend on the speaker
of the day, and the matter was re
ferred to Anne Townsend and Bob
Low for consultation with President
Wilbur and Edgar Eugene Robinson,
chairman of the Committee on Pub
lic Exercises.
CONST!. .ON: Wilson Can
non's recommendation that the A. S.
S. U. constitution be revised, cor
rected, and brought up to date was
acccptcd by the committee. His re
port was based upon experience in
publishing the constitution and by
laws as co-editor of the Frosh Bible.
His colleague Dwight Hutchinson
seconded the recommendation. "You
can prove almost anything by those
by-laws," he said.
John Porter presented an amend
ment which will be placed on the
ballot in next Tuesday's election.
It provides that all candidates for
student office must be members of
the A.S.S.U. at the time of their
election.
CAL-STANFORD: Ex Committee
voted to renew the pledge of friendly
relations during Big Game rivalry,
and to ban invasions find destruction
of campus property.
FIREARMS: The Administration
has asked the students to take a
stand on the possession and use of
guns on the Stanford campus pro
hibited by the University. A.S.S.U.
President Bruce Jessup appointed
Ross Anderson to investigate the
matter.
