# Old-Fashioned Sets Featured in First Play
## Johansen Introduces Elaborate Scenery In Goldsmith Comedy 
### 
Sets in Elizabethan period will set
ihe stage for the 18th century manor
house and inn in "She Stoops to
Conquer," to be presented in the
main auditorium Friday and Satur
day nights.
Discrepancy in the centuries is due
to the fact that the play asks for a
UOO-year-old country home in which
the slapstick comedy of Oliver Gold
smith's satire takes place.
All three sets are on a revolving
stage and make it possible to change
scenes in 30 seconds. Waldemar Jo
hansen, technical director, displays
outstanding ingenuity in combining
the different sets. The staircase of
an interior runs light through the
back of the drop and becomes the
.staircase in a different scene.
A door in one scene is a window
in the next, and care must be taken
so that steps are placed on the other
side so that the actors will not fall
through. This necessitates nailing
:;teps to the back of a set to prevent
accidents.
Best built of the sets for this play
is the solid 16th century staircase
which is built around the fireplace
for the interior of the Hardcastle
home. The stairs, which are 18 by
22 feet, were built extra strong to
prevent breakage when Tony Lump
kin (Bud Cady) falls down the
length of the stairs.
If the audiences care to tax their
imaginations or test their memories,
Mr. Johansen suggests that they try
to remember which set of props and
sets have been used before. Half of
the fun in putting the scenes to
gether is in seeing how cleverly the
stage crew can disguise old sets, for
nothing is wasted.
