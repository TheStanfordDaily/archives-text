# Stanford Scientist Develops New Cancer-Producing Serum
## 
### CHARLES BULL 
Once again Stanford has broken into prominence in the scientific world
with the announcement of results of a laboratory experiment which may
prove to he a definite lead toward a cure lor one of the most mysterious
of human diseases—cancer.
After experimenting for months in the Stanford Medical School a

young research surgeon, Dr.
Frederick Menke, announced in the
latest issue of "Science," official pub- |
lication of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science, that
he had apparently succeeded in ex
tracting from human cancers a
serum which, when injected into ex
perimental animals, would produce
a fatal cancer.
Dr. Menke, who secured his M.D.
from Johns Hopkins University in
1938, stressed the fact that this first
success was not definite enough to
call a cancer-cure, but that he was
conducting further experiments to
corroborate his first results.
HUMAN CELLS USED
Some of these substances are by
products of coal tar, some paraffin
-compounds, and certain compounds
of sex hormones. It has also been
claimed that over-exposure to X
rays will cause the disease.
But these substances, as such, are
otherwise harmless, and physicians
have never been able to determine
just what it was in these com
pounds which caused cancer to de
velop.
Dr. Menke's experiment consisted
of removing two small human
breast cancers and grinding them up.
Following this, the material was cov
ered with a fat-dissolving liquid and
then placed in a refrigerator. The
substance left after draining and
distilling the liquid was injected
into mice.
Several months afterward malig
nant cancer growths appeared in
these mice.
GROWTHS REMOVED
Not satisfied with this, Dr. Menke
removed tiny parts of these growths,
determined microscopically that they
were cancerous, then performed the
delicate operation of transferring
these particles to healthy mice.
These tumors continued to grow
and develop in the second group of
mice.
There, of course, remains much to
be done before it is definitely deter
mined that the process will be re
versible and act as a cure or a pre
ventive, but Dr. Menke's experiment
may perhaps lead to medical sci
ence's coming a lot closer to know
ing the exact nature of the causes of
cancer.
In 1939 the output of frozen foods
was 500.000,000 pounds in the United
States.

1938, stressed the fact that this first
success was not definite enough to
call a cancer-cure, but that he was
conducting further experiments to
corroborate his first results.
HUMAN CELLS USED
Some of these substances are by
products of coal tar, some paraffin
-compounds, and certain compounds
of sex hormones. It has also been
claimed that over-exposure to X
rays will cause the disease.
But these substances, as such, are
otherwise harmless, and physicians
have never been able to determine
just what it was in these com
pounds which caused cancer to de
velop.
Dr. Menke's experiment consisted
of removing two small human
breast cancers and grinding them up.
Following this, the material was cov
ered with a fat-dissolving liquid and
then placed in a refrigerator. The
substance left after draining and
distilling the liquid was injected
into mice.
Several months afterward malig
nant cancer growths appeared in
these mice.
GROWTHS REMOVED
Not satisfied with this, Dr. Menke
removed tiny parts of these growths,
determined microscopically that they
were cancerous, then performed the
delicate operation of transferring
these particles to healthy mice.
These tumors continued to grow
and develop in the second group of
mice.
There, of course, remains much to
be done before it is definitely deter
mined that the process will be re
versible and act as a cure or a pre
ventive, but Dr. Menke's experiment
may perhaps lead to medical sci
ence's coming a lot closer to know
ing the exact nature of the causes of
cancer.
In 1939 the output of frozen foods
was 500.000,000 pounds in the United
States.
Once again Stanford has broken into prominence in the scientific world
with the announcement of results of a laboratory experiment which may
prove to he a definite lead toward a cure lor one of the most mysterious
of human diseases—cancer.
After experimenting for months in the Stanford Medical School a

young research surgeon, Dr.
Frederick Menke, announced in the
latest issue of "Science," official pub- |
lication of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science, that
he had apparently succeeded in ex
tracting from human cancers a
serum which, when injected into ex
perimental animals, would produce
a fatal cancer.
