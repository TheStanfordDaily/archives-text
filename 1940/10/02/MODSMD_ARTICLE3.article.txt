# Nazi Diplomatic Moves Raise England's Hopes; War of Attrition Looms
## Air Attacks on Isles to Continue As Germans Relinquish Invasion Plans for Wearing-Down Process 
### United Press 
What may be an explanation for Germany's intense diplomatic offensive
of the past week and her search for new allies came from the Nazi
high command Tuesday.
In an almost outright admission, a spokesman of the German war
leaders made it clear that the "softening up" of Bi'itish resistance is a big

task and that Germany is
resigned to a longer war—at least
through the coming winter.
There was no mention of invasion
in the spokesman's statement which
said that, although "cyclonic" aerial
blows will be rained upon England
as long as the weather permits,
Adolf Hitler will count upon his
counter-blockade and the ravages of
"general hunger" to help wear down
Britain's resistance.
LONG WAR SEEN
This significant statement would
appear to lend credence to Britain's
assertions, immediately after the
signing of the Italo-German-Japa
nese alliance in Berlin last Friday,
that Hitler has abandoned his hopes
of a quick knockout victory and is
seeking allies for a long war.
It might well also explain the bit
ter warnings to the United States
emanating from Berlin and Rome —
warnings that the United States will
be "destroyed" if she dares to enter
more boldly into aid for Britain.
HITLER FEARS AMERICA
The Nazi high command's state
ment in Berlin gives rise to specula
tion, therefore, that Hitler is recon
ciled to another year of war and is
deeply afraid that the increasing
American aid to Britain may tip the
scales in the end.
A strong arm of the German press,
the Hamburger Fremdenblatt, Tues
day called upon both Russia and the
United States to announce their
"final positions" in the war and get
off the fence —join either Britain or
the Axis powers.
RUSSIA HOLDS KEY
But it was added quickly that
Germany knows how Russia will go
—that she will get together with
Japan on a scheme for a new "Euro-
Asian" order supplementing the
Axis-Japanese alliance.
From Moscow it was reported that
an early attempt to improve Russian-
Japanese relations following the new
Axis-Japan alliance is anticipated.
The Soviet press accused the United
States of "full association" with Great
Britain's war effort.
DIPLOMACY HOLDS STAGE
Although emphasizing German
reassurances of friendship, the offi
cial government newspaper Izvestia
said that Russia is determined to re
main neutral and aloof from the war
insofar as that decision depends
upon Moscow.
Diplomatic mancuverings over
shadowed actual warfare on all
fronts Tuesday—in Rome, Berlin,
Moscow, Madrid and Vichy.
Spanish Minister of Interior Ra
mon Serrano Suner and Mussolini
held a one-hour and 25-minute talk
in Rome in which they discussed a
plan — according to information put
out by Fascist quarters—for an
Arab rebellion in Africa and Asia
against the British.
FRANCO HESITATES
Mussolini still appeared to be try
ing to bring Spain more actively into
the war but the French government
at Vichy heard that Generalissimo
Francisco Franco still is opposed to
throwing in his lot actively with the
Axis.
As Nazi spokesmen boasted that
German air raids on England will be
steadily increased in scope and in
tensity if the present good weather
continues, bombing squadrons were
reported to have struck at scattered
j British targets with "great success."
The official Nazi news agency re-
I ported Tuesday night that "fairly
strong" formations of German bomb
j ers and fighters were carrying out
"nuisance flights" over London.
