# S.P.U. Forms Student Forum
## New Group to Hold Town Hall Meeting 
### 
When the Stanford Political Un
ion broke up due to lack of interest
last spring, campus leaders plunged
their thumbs into the activities pie
and pulled out a plum.
The plum they produced has been
named the Stanford Forum, a ren
aissance of the old S.P.U., with the
purpose of presenting town-hall
forum type meetings.
The Forum will present prominent
student leaders and public figures of
the Bay Region, offering both points
of view on controversial issues, in
its two meetings each quarter.
"We feel there should be an or
ganization on campus to present con
troversial issues on public affairs,
particularly in an election year and
in a war year," states Bob Peckham,
temporary chairman.
The committee for formation of
the Forum, which will meet Thurs
day at 7:15 o'clock in the basement
of the Women's Clubhouse, is com
posed of Helen Severance, Dan
Hayes, George Hislop, Hugh O'Don
nell, Bill Turner, Maurice Knox, and
Frank Mallory.
Peckham states a recent School of
Education survey shows student-run
forums with prominent outside
speakers are the most popular
of meeting.
