r l' , WO Indian gridders were an
nounced as winners of best play
er awards yesterday. Which jusl >
goes to show something or other.
Any "expert" who proposes to pick 1
one player as an outstanding per- f
former over any of six other mem
bers of that Big Red Machine Sat
urday has a distorted idea of his own j
powers of judgment, which must be |
nonexistent.
Before going further it would be
well to say that we're very glad
Pete Kmetovic won the Hatlo Hat |
award of the Call-Bulletin and that
Vic Lindskog was given the Keeble
Pen Award. They're both swell j
guys, swell ball players, and they
did a very nice job at Kezar.
But what about Frankic Albert,
who completed four out of nine j
passes and called signals almost
flawlessly for the first team? What
about Norm Standlee, who aver
aged almost eight yards per crack
running and played a whale of a
defensive game? What about
those sophomore linemen, Chuck
Taylor. Bruno Banducci, and Dick
Palmer?
About the only way to clear the"
thing up would be to give a dupli
cate award to every man on the first
Iwo strings and a special award to
Clark Shaughnessy. Anyway, there
are eight games left to go, so most
of the boys will be able to take home
Mime award or other.
1.1 «! )(t
of awards, "The Chief" j
1 got off to a great start in his
battle for All-American fullback |
honors. To begin, he definitely elim- j
inated a rival, Cliff Fisk. Fisk had a I
ground gaining average of 1.2 yards!
per play, completed a couple of \
passes against the Indian second j
string, and got off a few low kicks,
the kind that don't give ends any !
time to get down on the safety man.
To polish the whole thing off, he |
was suckered constantly on defense. [
Standlee turned in a very fine |
game of football. He smashed
through to a touchdown in the
third quarter, averaged 7.8 yards \
per play from scrimmage, and j
played a capable, alert game on ;
defense. Add to that a pair of tow
ering 60-yard punts and you have j
a nice day's work. How does John
Kimbrough stack up against that?

our frolicsome fresh
man, wandered out to the var
sity practice field Monday to get a
close look at the guys that walloped
the Dons. He got a fair view of the
club through a crack in the fence.
His attention was soon attracted
by an aged individual looking
through a knothole a few feet, fur
ther along the fence. Said a.i.
seemed about to take off. He croaked ;
at Archibald.
'That Stanford team Saturday J
did the hardest and cleanest block
ing and tackling of any Indian
squad in years. So I come out to
watch practice today, and what do
I see? They're blocking and
tackling!"
And the a.i. was right. Coach !
Clark Shaughnessy drilled his Big I
Red Machine for forty-five minutes
Monday afternoon on live tackling
and blocking the dummies.

JJARRY SHIPKEY's frosh squad,
with their opening tilt only three
days away, is beginning to look like
a reasonably accurate facsimile of a |
football team. There are a raft of i
husky linemen cluttering up the |
frosh practice field, and they tell us |
that some of the backs are pretty j
talented boys.
The Papoose eleven will prob
ably not be as much of a minia
ture copy of the varsity as usual.
The Shipkeymen will operate :
mainly from a single wingback.
and will not go in so heavily for
the razzle-dazzle stuff. Also, they
probably won't be quite so flashily
attired.
It might be a good idea to get
out to the stadium early this Sat
urday to watch the debut of the
Little Red Machine against San
Mateo J. C.
