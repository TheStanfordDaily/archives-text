# Shipkey Seeks Frosh Passer
## 
### 
Freshman Coach Harry Shipkey
will seek a successor to Frankie Al
bert and A1 Cole among his current
crop of gridders in today's practice.
The past two years Shipkey's highly
successful teams have been built
around a talented pitching armâ€”in
'38 it was Albert, in '39 it was A1
Cole.
Backfield candidates who will
have to prove their mettle in to
day's pass scrimmage are Jackie
Reynolds at quarter. Bob Koch at
one half, Bob Mitchell at the other,
and Randy Fawcett at full.
Since San Mateo J. C. has yet to
play a game this season, the frosh
coaching staff knows very little con
cerning the type of game the Bull
dogs play.
Defensive work will be the main
field of concentration for tomorrow's
drill, while Friday will probably see
a practice session featuring kick
offs and kick-off returns.
