# Derringer to Face Newsom In Opening World Series Tilt
## 
### 
CINCINNATI. Oct. 1 (UP). —The baseball drama that is the World
Series will begin on Croslev Field tomorrow wtih the crippled Cincinnati
Reds launching a determined drive to return the world's championship to
the National League by conquering the powerhouse Detroit Tigers, the
team that dethroned the once mighty Yankees.

More than 33,000 spectators
jam Cincinnati's park to see two of |
the game's greatest right-handed j
pitchers, big Paul Derringer of the j
Reds and loquacious Buck Ncwsom j
of the Tigers, battle it out in the i
opening skirmish of the 36th annual ;
baseball classic.
Delmar Baker, the thin man pilot j
of the Tigers, finally broke down to
day and officially named Newsom as
Detroit's starting pitcher. Bill Mc-
Kechnie, the Reds' tight-lipped lead
er, refused to go any further than to
say his pitcher would be either Der
ringer or Bucky Walters, the Na
tional League's top winner who's i
notched 22 triumphs. All the "ex- !
perts" are agreed it'll be Derringer
and will be mighty sore at McKech- j
nie if he crosses them up and leads j
with Walters.
Only authority for the selection i
of Derringer is the fact Derringer j
was chosen to open last year's World
Series against the Yanks and re
sponded with a magnificent game j
that ended as a loser only because
his teammates failed to field cleanly !
behind him.
Baker's pitching selection came j
after the Tigers' pilot held a five
minute chat with Newsom and i
Schoolboy Rowe. After a few min
utes earnest conversation, Baker

fr —-—
I named Newsom, the 210-pound
| Hartsviile, N.C., product, as his
I starter.
The biggest headache for McKech -
! nie isn't who shall pitch the opening
| game but whether his three cripples
! will be fit for action. From their
j actions in practice today, second
baseman Lonnie Frey, the National
League's stolen base king and mid
dleman in the Reds' classy infield,
seems definitely out of the first
game and catcher Ernie Lombardi,
Reds' leading hitter, also seems likely
| to be on the bench tomorrow.
This series, in which the Tigers
■ are quoted 3-2 favorites to give the
American League its sixth straight
World Series triumph, is the same
j old story—National League pitching
j against American League power.
