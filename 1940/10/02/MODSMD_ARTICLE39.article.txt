## Card Varsity Shoots Passes, Plans Defense Against Ducks 
### 
Coach Clark Shaughnessy and his coaching staff were a little alarmed
again yesterday when their star quarterback and signal caller Frankie
Albert again turned up for practice in his street clothes.
On the advice of team physician Dr. Paul Davies, Albert continued to
rest the painful charley horse he picked up in the U.S.F. game, but he will

| definitely be back in uniform today 4
; and try his talented hand at throw- t
j ing some of those new pass plays ;
j Shaughnessy will uncork against '
! Oregon Saturday.
j Yesterday's workout was taken up 1
! mainly by signal practice and the 1
majority of the plays were along the
aerial line. Substitute quarterbacks
Ray Hammett and Bob Crane, work
ing in Albert's place, did most of the
throwing.
HUNT SCOUTS OREGON
Assistant Coach Husky Hunt had
his usual handful of opponents'
plays. The Indians' chief scout has
gathered plenty of dope on the Web
feet through Phil Bengtson's report
on Oregon's opener this year and
from moving pictures of last year's
Stanford-Oregon game.
Last year a lethargic Cardinal
team watched the Webfeet backs
roll by them for 140 yards and al
lowed the Ducks' passers, Jay Gray- j
beal and Bob Smith, pass them dizzy
to lose 10-0. Gone this year are the
big gun Graybeal, Smith, and the
plunging Frank Emmons.
BERRY IS THREAT
This season Coach Tex Oliver has
j built his attack around a hard-run
! ner and sharp passer, Buck Berry
by name. Another characteristic of
Oliver-coached teams is that they ;
are perennially at their best early in
the season, declining in power as the
season goes on.
Today the yarsity will undoubted
ly go to work on the Oregon plays
against a Hunt-coached eleven of
Grays. They will benefit by work
ing against the Northerners' dia
mond formation in order to not be
alarmed by this strange forma
tion.
In the final analysis the only way
they are going to stop what Oliver's
| team throws at them will be that
effective defensive line charge that
stopped U.S.F. so coldly on all the
running plays and attempted passes.
