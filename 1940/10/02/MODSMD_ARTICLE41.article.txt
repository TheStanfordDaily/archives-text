### 
A meeting will be held in Room 8
of the B.A.C. Friday to make plans
for a competitive gymnastic team
for this year. All men are eligible
to compete and are urged to attend
the meeting and sign up.
The schedule so far includes the
regular match with California. There
are also prospects of competing in
the Pacific Association A.A.U. meet,
held in San Francisco. Other inter
collegiate matches are being planned.
