# On the Record

### 
A REVAMPED and completely redesigned
Activities Card File bobbed up at last
night's Ex Committee meeting when Betty
Avery and Jim Mack presented their method
of democratizing the Farm's activities picture.
Legislative football of the first two Excom
get-togethers, Card File was turned over to
men's and women's chairmen for investigation.
The results of the investigation became part of
the Associated Students' records last night.
And the committee, without official action
but with strong intent decided that it would, def
initely, "put teeth" into the plan which was dis
cussed.
The existing card file, housed now in the
Union, will be junked and a new system of
registration will be instituted. This method of
signing prospective extra-curricular workers
will be decentralized, will not require men and
women to trudge to an office and sit in line
waiting to be interviewed. Instead house and
hall presidents, eating-club chieftains, Inter
fraternity and Interclub Council, and sponsors
in Roble and Encina will be circularized within
the next week. They will, in turn, be respon
sible for registering occupants of their living
groups.
Expertly-phrased cards will be sent these
local student officials. And, once these cards
are filled in, they will be placed in a master
file, classified according to activity-preference
and class of each individual.
And from this master file, which should con
tain the name of every Stanford man and wom
an interested in participating in campus activi
ties, will come the committees that will carry
forward the Farm's student life.
Excommittee's task is clearly stated. Once
the two Card File chairmen have proved that
their scheme will work, that their registration
is a representative one involving all would-be
workers, Excom should back that plan to the
limit.
It is conceivable that Excommittee may force,
through legislative action, all committee chair
men to pick their members from the Card File.
Without this positive backing, the plan will
again fall into disuse. And to toy with an effi
cient and well-mapped procedure to democra
tize the entire activities picture would be foolish.
To work, the Card File must have student
and Excommittee support, and that support
must be bulwarked by strong legislative
means.

will be decentralized, will not require men and
women to trudge to an office and sit in line
waiting to be interviewed. Instead house and
hall presidents, eating-club chieftains, Inter
fraternity and Interclub Council, and sponsors
in Roble and Encina will be circularized within
the next week. They will, in turn, be respon
sible for registering occupants of their living
groups.
Expertly-phrased cards will be sent these
local student officials. And, once these cards
are filled in, they will be placed in a master
file, classified according to activity-preference
and class of each individual.
And from this master file, which should con
tain the name of every Stanford man and wom
an interested in participating in campus activi
ties, will come the committees that will carry
forward the Farm's student life.
Excommittee's task is clearly stated. Once
the two Card File chairmen have proved that
their scheme will work, that their registration
is a representative one involving all would-be
workers, Excom should back that plan to the
limit.
It is conceivable that Excommittee may force,
through legislative action, all committee chair
men to pick their members from the Card File.
Without this positive backing, the plan will
again fall into disuse. And to toy with an effi
cient and well-mapped procedure to democra
tize the entire activities picture would be foolish.
To work, the Card File must have student
and Excommittee support, and that support
must be bulwarked by strong legislative
means.
A REVAMPED and completely redesigned
Activities Card File bobbed up at last
night's Ex Committee meeting when Betty
Avery and Jim Mack presented their method
of democratizing the Farm's activities picture.
Legislative football of the first two Excom
get-togethers, Card File was turned over to
men's and women's chairmen for investigation.
The results of the investigation became part of
the Associated Students' records last night.
And the committee, without official action
but with strong intent decided that it would, def
initely, "put teeth" into the plan which was dis
cussed.
The existing card file, housed now in the
Union, will be junked and a new system of
registration will be instituted. This method of
signing prospective extra-curricular workers
will be decentralized, will not require men and
women to trudge to an office and sit in line
waiting to be interviewed. Instead house and
