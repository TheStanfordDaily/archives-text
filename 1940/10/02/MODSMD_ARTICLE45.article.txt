# It's a Great Life
## 
### 
WHILE Stanford's life-stream moves rapidly
through its well-laid-out channels, it is
sometimes interesting to pause a moment and
look in retrospect over our shoulders at the
past.
The Farm is a happy place at the moment.
The football team emerged triumphant in its
first contest, and in doing so looked like the
finest gridiron aggregation to represent the
Cardinals since the famed "Vow Boys." With
the guarter in its academic infancy, text-books
are still more or less curios that have been
purchased only to assuage guilty consciences.
I he new crop of frosh and transfer women is
acclaimed by "experts" as being the best in
years. Most of us still have bank books that
we can get reading pleasure from.
All in all, it looks like a fine year ahead. '
Bui a curious, detached glimpse into the
mirror that reflects the near-past gives us a
perspective that is unhampered by the con
fusing proximity of all these things that make
the opening part of autumn quarter, 1940, seem
like a fairyland world.
l or instance, The Stanford Daily of exactly
one year ago, October 2, 1940, was published
in just about the same circumstances as today's
Daily. The guarter was young; students were
still getting back into the college routine after
pleasant summers. Interest in what was said in
The Daily was sporadic.
From the safe viewpoint of a year's distance.

however, it is interesting to glance back at the
campus and national news of October 2, 1939.
Announcement of "Dink" Templeton's resig
nation was top news in The Daily that day. One
of the most colorful figures in Pacific Coast
athletic circles, Dink will leave a memory with
every person who had any contact with him.
His eighteen years as Stanford's track coach are
a background that will make him one of the
Farm's cherished traditions.
Interesting in view of Italy's present position
in Europe's tangled skein of life, is the follow
ing quotation from United Press, printed just a
year ago in The Daily:
"Italy seemed to be showing scant enthu
siasm for (Count) Ciano's visit to Berlin and the
Fascist press stressed 'economics and peace'
rather than the eventuality of Italian military
aid. Since Hitler's new working arrangement
with the Soviets was announced last week the
Italians have regarded it warily and suspi
ciously."
No editorial comment is necessary.
Furthermore, the sports page relayed the sad
news that the Indian football team had been
soundly defeated by Oregon State in the sea
son's opener the previous week-end.
Our retrospective look causes a grimace at
the football defeat, a feeling of wonderment at
Italy's ethical turnabout, a feeling of nostalgia
as we recall the passing of Dink from Stanford.
Despite conscription and the raise in tuition,
this is a pretty good world we Americans
live in right now—comparatively speaking, of
course.
The present has it all over the past. Nine
teen-forty is a happier year than its prede
cessor. Stanford has itself a football team this
year.—G. M.
