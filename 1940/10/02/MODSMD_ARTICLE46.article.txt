JUST as if you didn't know already. Yep, the area
of California totals 155,652 square miles. Bet you
had it on the tip of your tongue all the time. It's a
handy thing to know the area of California.
You could, but you wouldn't, go on reading that
sort of stuff all day. And some of you wouldn't feel
personally offended. But the point of all this area
business is that it plays an important part in the
growth and the spread of flying in these good old
United States.
Getting to the point, it was announced in yester
day's papers that money made available by Congress
will, in the near future be used to enlarge, improve
and equip 183 airports in California. Over twenty mil
lion good American dollars are going into this project.
* * * *
are more airports in California. But just sup
pose there weren't. Suppose there were just those
183.
A little simple mathematics shows then that there
is one airport for every 850 square miles of California —
and that's countin' the mountains, forests, lakes an'
everything But to get 850 square miles, you've got to
draw a square about 30 miles long, by 30 miles wide.
So, figuratively speaking, if you fly or walk 30
miles in the right direction you should hit another
airport. One of those new inexpensive light planes
can cruise four times 30 miles in an hour, and around
300 miles without refueling.
In short, the use of new light planes by Mr. and
Mrs. and Miss Smith, and you and you is every day
becoming more practical, more safe, more economical,
more rapid. Why sweat along in a car? Fly over to
the next town. It's faster; and besides you'll average
about 25 miles to the gallon by air.
* * « *
r JpHE whole thing isn't as far distant or as imprac
tical as you might imagine. Today these new two
and three-seater planes cost as little as a thousand
dollars. Your parents' dollars will do. Or rob a bank
if you must. All airports are expanding like mad.
After they've built enough army planes, they'll have
to do something for a living.
Light planes for everybody will be the next step.
Then you can wait until Saturday morning, and fly
down to the U.C.L.A. game. But how are they going
to enforce the Mann Act?

After they've built enough army planes, they'll have
to do something for a living.
Light planes for everybody will be the next step.
Then you can wait until Saturday morning, and fly
down to the U.C.L.A. game. But how are they going
to enforce the Mann Act?

JUST as if you didn't know already. Yep, the area
of California totals 155,652 square miles. Bet you
had it on the tip of your tongue all the time. It's a
handy thing to know the area of California.
You could, but you wouldn't, go on reading that
sort of stuff all day. And some of you wouldn't feel
personally offended. But the point of all this area
business is that it plays an important part in the
growth and the spread of flying in these good old
United States.
Getting to the point, it was announced in yester
day's papers that money made available by Congress
will, in the near future be used to enlarge, improve
and equip 183 airports in California. Over twenty mil
lion good American dollars are going into this project.

are more airports in California. But just sup
pose there weren't. Suppose there were just those
183.
A little simple mathematics shows then that there
is one airport for every 850 square miles of California —
and that's countin' the mountains, forests, lakes an'
everything But to get 850 square miles, you've got to
draw a square about 30 miles long, by 30 miles wide.
So, figuratively speaking, if you fly or walk 30
miles in the right direction you should hit another
airport. One of those new inexpensive light planes
can cruise four times 30 miles in an hour, and around
300 miles without refueling.
In short, the use of new light planes by Mr. and
Mrs. and Miss Smith, and you and you is every day
becoming more practical, more safe, more economical,
more rapid. Why sweat along in a car? Fly over to
the next town. It's faster; and besides you'll average
about 25 miles to the gallon by air.

r JpHE whole thing isn't as far distant or as imprac
tical as you might imagine. Today these new two
and three-seater planes cost as little as a thousand
dollars. Your parents' dollars will do. Or rob a bank
if you must. All airports are expanding like mad.
