r jpHE EDITOR, SIR:
It seems to me that our schedule of campus activi
ties here at Stanford is in need of readjustment. The
unequal distribution with which we are burdened at
present is not only impractical but totally unneces
sary.
With 30 weeks of school — surely enough time to
program all campus activities—it is absurd that we
.should crowd The County Fair, Convalescent Drive,
Water Carnival, and Junior Prom into the ten weeks
of spring quarter, while our winter quarter is dead
and lifeless because of an appalling lack of organized
campus activity. Certainly it would be more logical,
and less wearing from the students' point of view, to
reprogram these events with an eye to a more equitable
distribution.
