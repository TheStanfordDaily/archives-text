# I'LL NEVER SMILE AGAIN

EDITOR, SIR:
Perhaps you may consider mc presumptious—using
your columns for the purpose of airing a personal
gripe. However, I just couldn't control myself after
the strange thing that happened to me today. I have
to complain to someone and my roommates just won't
listen—all four of them being dryhalls who have abso
lutely no sympathy with honest misery.
It seems that I received a phone call from someone
whose voice was definitely feminine. (There is a wide
difference between effeminate and feminine.) Think
of it! In a few brief days I am overwhelmed by two
great happenings: a Stanford football victory and a
phone call from a woman.
But while I had the goood fortune to witness the
football triumph I was extremely unfortunate in
that I was not present to hear the voice. Consequently,
I have no way of knowing who it. was who phoned
me—except that I was told she had a lovely voice.
Seeing as I have been enrolled at Stanford for
three years now without ever before getting a phone
call from a woman, I wonder if you would print this
plea asking her to phone me again. If she happens to
be the secretary to my department head, tell her to
forget it.
Hopefully.
