# 'My Love' Is Light Summer Entertainment
## 
### 
"My Love Came Back" and "We
Who Are Young." now playing at
the Varsity Theater.
For some reason or other, the bulk
of the Class A movies bursts upon
the palpitating public in the fall. Ap
parently the idea is that during the
summer people go to the movies to
keep cool, or just don't go. At. any
rate, the really good summer picture
is rare.
The Varsity is showing two of the
low-budget summer productions to
day and, unlike most of their type,
they are worth seeing. At least "My
Love Came Back" is worth admis
sion plus war-tax, and "We Who
Are Young" won't bother you once
you're in.
FROTHY, WITTY
"Witty," "frothy," "amusing" are
the adjectives applicable to "My
Love Came Back." The only thing
in the plot that could possibly worry
anyone is how long it's going to take
the love to come back; and since the
two involved are Jeffrey Lynn and
Olivia de Haviland, you know that
it's just a question of time.
It's all about a girl violinist and
an elderly music company execu
tive. He's supplying her Academy
scholarship, but she doesn't know it.
Everyone else misunderstands her
motives. As a skeleton plot, it does
n't sound like much, but the direc
tor's touch is so light as to be al
most feathery; the dialogue fairly
crackles, and the characters are de
lightful to the last actor.
LYNN IS HERO
Charles Winninger is the nice ex
ecutive, Lynn is his company man
ager who signs the checks with one
eye-brow caught in his hair-line.
Spring Byington is the executive's
wife, Eddie Albert is a harrassed
music student with a swing band on
his mind, Jane Wyman is Albert's
girl friend, and two youngsters in
the upper-adolescervt brackets play
the Byington-Winninger progeny.
Musically speaking you couldn't
ask for much more. "Orpheus in the
Underworld" is played straight, and
Lizst's "Hungarian Rhapsody," a
Chopin Nocturne, and the Mendel
ssohn Concerto are swung in a man
ner worth listening to.
Best touch in the whole show is
the two tiny figures dancing across
a tremendous sheet of music. They
waltz, polka, and polka-mazurka to
the very best of Strauss, Lanner, and
Walteufel. It's an excellent way to
indicate the passing of a pleasant
evening.窶年owell

Olivia de Haviland, you know that
it's just a question of time.
It's all about a girl violinist and
an elderly music company execu
tive. He's supplying her Academy
scholarship, but she doesn't know it.
Everyone else misunderstands her
motives. As a skeleton plot, it does
n't sound like much, but the direc
tor's touch is so light as to be al
most feathery; the dialogue fairly
crackles, and the characters are de
lightful to the last actor.
LYNN IS HERO
Charles Winninger is the nice ex
ecutive, Lynn is his company man
ager who signs the checks with one
eye-brow caught in his hair-line.
Spring Byington is the executive's
wife, Eddie Albert is a harrassed
music student with a swing band on
his mind, Jane Wyman is Albert's
girl friend, and two youngsters in
the upper-adolescervt brackets play
the Byington-Winninger progeny.
Musically speaking you couldn't
ask for much more. "Orpheus in the
Underworld" is played straight, and
Lizst's "Hungarian Rhapsody," a
Chopin Nocturne, and the Mendel
ssohn Concerto are swung in a man
ner worth listening to.
Best touch in the whole show is
the two tiny figures dancing across
a tremendous sheet of music. They
waltz, polka, and polka-mazurka to
the very best of Strauss, Lanner, and
Walteufel. It's an excellent way to
indicate the passing of a pleasant
evening.窶年owell
"My Love Came Back" and "We
Who Are Young." now playing at
the Varsity Theater.
For some reason or other, the bulk
of the Class A movies bursts upon
the palpitating public in the fall. Ap
parently the idea is that during the
summer people go to the movies to
keep cool, or just don't go. At. any
rate, the really good summer picture
is rare.
The Varsity is showing two of the
low-budget summer productions to
day and, unlike most of their type,
they are worth seeing. At least "My
Love Came Back" is worth admis
sion plus war-tax, and "We Who
Are Young" won't bother you once
you're in.
FROTHY, WITTY
"Witty," "frothy," "amusing" are
the adjectives applicable to "My
Love Came Back." The only thing
in the plot that could possibly worry
anyone is how long it's going to take
the love to come back; and since the
two involved are Jeffrey Lynn and
Olivia de Haviland, you know that
it's just a question of time.
