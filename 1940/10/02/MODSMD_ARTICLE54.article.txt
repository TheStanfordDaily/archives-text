## 
### 
"Through Books lo Men" is the I
subject of a talk to be given on the
Stanford Hour at 5:30 o'clock today
over Station KPO by Virgil K. Whit
aker, assistant professor of English. [
Dr. Whitaker will show that the
best approach to the understanding
of human nature is through wide
reading, not merely of biography, but
also of drama and fiction.
Examples from "Pride and Preju
dice, "Babbitt," and "Adam Bede" j
will be cited to show that man is
made more understandable by read- i
ing fiction.
