# Bailey Analyzes World Policies In Series Talk
## Lecture Lists Five Fundamental Foreign Policies of America 
### 
Showing how the attitudes and
policies of nations of the world have
changed in recent years, with spe
cial attention to those of the United
States, Thomas A. Bailey, professor
of history, opened the Tuesday Eve
ning Series last night in Memorial
Hall.
Professor Bailey summed up the
policies of all nations under four
points: (1) The policies of all sov
ereign states are for their own in
terests. (2) Policies are means to
an end, the end being the welfare
of the state. (3) Policies are pri
vate property of the countries in
volved. (4) In the case of conflicting
policies, that backed by the most
force will be the most powerful.
SECURITY DEAD
"Collective security is dead; the
word of a nation no longer means
anything; world opinion no longer
holds the power it once did; and in
ternational law has gone by the
boards," he pointed out.
Bringing his points closer to home,
the lecturer discussed in detail the
five fundamental foreign policies of
the United States: isolation, free
dom of the seas, Pan-Americanism,
the Monroe Doctrine, and the Open
Door. Isolation is no more than an
ideal, he pointed out. He showed
how the repeal of the arms embargo,
our destroyer trade with England,
and the general will of the people
to stay out of conflicts have drifted
away from isolation.
U.S. NOT NEUTRAL
"We are not a neutralâ€”but a non
belligerent," he asserted.
"Freedom of the seas now is just
the freedom of a country to exercise
freedom to keep out of danger
zones," he showed.
Pan - Americanism has been
strengthened because of the Good
Neighbor policy of this country and
the gathering of the 21 republics at
such conferences as were held at
Havana and Lima in the face of a
common peril, he asserted.
Professor Bailey showed how the
Open Door policy in China is di
rectly opposite to the previous non
intervention custom.
In conclusion, Professor Bailey
declared the United States' foreign
policy to be based upon three points:
(1) We must determine where our
vital interests lie. (2) We must
clearly define our policies to agree
with the interests. (3) We must as
semble force to support these poli
cies.
