# PETUNIA SEED HARVEST BOOMS
## 
### 

THESE MEN are sifting piles of petunia seeds at Lompoc, Santa Bar
bara County, in a harvest made unusually valuable this year by the
loss of the flower seed supply from France and Yugoslavia. Approxi
mately 60 per cent of the world flower seed production comes from
2500 acres in the Lompoc and Santa Maria Valleys, aided by the Sa
linas output.
