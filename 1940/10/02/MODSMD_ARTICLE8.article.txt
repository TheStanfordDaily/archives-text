# Halls Name Winters, Robesky, Randall in Stormy Meeting
## 
### 
Hall slate of candidates for next
Tuesday's special student body elec
tions was selected last night at the
first meeting of Inter-Club Council.
The group, representing men in
Toyon, Branner, Sequoia, and stu
dents living off-campus, nominated
Dana Winters for graduate man on
Ex Committee, Ken Robesky for
8.A.C., and Jack Randall for Men's
Council.
During a stormy session in which
one group threatened to withdraw its
support of the ticket unless it was
represented, President Dick Meyer
hoff asked the Council to select
candidates who were "best quali
fied" without consideration for their
club or hall affiliations.
To acquaint incoming freshmen
with the halls and eating clubs, the
Council decided to embark on a
large-scale orientation program,

which would give every freshman a
chance to participate.
Other business of the meeting
consisted of the tentative setting of
an exchange dinner with Union and
Lagunita for Wednesday evening,
Oct. 30. Representatives of the two
large women's residences, who were
present at the meeting, suggested
"other entertainment besides danc
ing such as bridge or ping-pong" be
included on the exchange program.
President Meyerhoff appointed
Irv Hellman to head the new frosh
orientation committee and Ed "Eggs"
Stone to arrange the exchange din
ner.
-An objection was l'aised to the
latter appointment on the grounds
that Stone was a member of an
organization which is known as a
"haven for campus hermits" and
which is naturally "averse to
women."
