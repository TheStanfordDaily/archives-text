### 
A bacteriology lecture room with
accommodations for 152 students
was put into use for the first time
last week. The projection room of
the amphitheater is equipped with
apparatus for sound, color, and or
dinary movies and slides.
According to Dr. E. W. Schultz,
professor of bacteriology and ex
perimental pathology, excellent
acoustics make it possible for the
lecturer to talk in an ordinary tone
of voice and still be heard clearly
by all the students. Behind the
regular amphitheater is a room for
demonstration experiments and,
eventually, a museum.
