press continued to hurl
threats at the United States and
Great Britain yesterday and it ap
peared that Japan was more than a
bit concerned over America's recent
steps to prevent a change in the
status quo in the Far East—namely
the embargo on scrap iron to Japan
and the new loan to China.
The Tokyo newspaper, Asahi,
warned the world that if Britain
and the United States place an em
bargo on oil, rubber, and tin ex
ports, the Japanese will prefer an
"all or nothing struggle" to "wait
ing for death."
Japanese officials, evidently, mis
judged American opinion in their
usual clumsy manner.

||OY W. HOWARD, head of the
Scripps - Howard newspaper
chain, suggested in a front-page col
umn last Monday that an American
commission be sent to the Orient to
seek better relations with Japan.
Bccause this suggestion came on the
heels of State Department action to
strengthen our stand in the Far East,
it was considered a refutation of the
Administration's attitude.
The Japanese interpreted How
ard's remarks as an indication that
the American public desired ap
peasement and did not support the
Administration attitude toward
Japan's plans for the creation of a
new Asia.
In addition, it is probable that the
Japanese believed that bellicose
propaganda from both Berlin and
Tokyo was creating the desired im
pression on Americans — that the
Administration's stand against the
newly formed Italo-German-Japa
nese alliance would lead the United
States into the war.
In an answer to Howard's
"message of appeasement," the
president of the powerful Japanese
Press Association suggested that
better relations could be achieved
if "America abandons its fortifica
tions at Pearl Harbor, Guam, and
the Midway Islands, gives up its
support of Chiang Kai-Shek, and
restores trade to normalcy. Oth
erwise," he continued, "an armed
clash is inevitable in the near
future."
Japan is on the spot: she thinks
that the United States will adopt
a policy of appeasement—a policy
that Americans discarded before
the war in Europe broke out.

p'ORMER Prime Minister Neville
Chamberlain of Great Britain,
who drew the title of "apostle of ap
peasement" following the Munich
debacle, will be retired from Brit
ain's war cabinet, it was revealed
last night when authoritative sources
disclosed that an immediate reshuf
fling of the cabinet was imminent.
Chamberlain, ending 21 years of
political life, has become a symbol
of that section of English opinion
which until the outbreak of war
urged every possible concession to
the totalitarian states in order to
avert a showdown.
When Winston Churchill succeeded
Chamberlain as Prime Minister, he
permitted Chamberlain to remain in
the cabinet. Many felt that vestiges
of appeasement remained so long as
Chamberlain was connected with the
government.
Various labor leaders who have
advocated resisting Naziism from
the start have demanded contin
ually Chamberlain's removal from
the government.
Although it is claimed that his
poor health is reason for his resig
nation, Chamberlain's absence from
the cabinet will be regarded by
many as a further indication of
British determination in the present
war. Britain's chief symbol of ap
peasement will no longer be a rep
resentative of the British people.
