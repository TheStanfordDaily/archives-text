Tomorrow night at 8:15 o'clock
Stanford audiences will get a chance
to see a play which packed the the
ater during the summer session.
Oilver Goldsmith's "She Stoops to
Conquer" or "The Mistakes of a
Night" will hit the boards pf Me
morial Hall tomorrow for a two
night run.
The Goldsmith comedy is based on
a series of complications which
arise when a practical joker tricks a
prospective suitor into believing the
home of his fiancee is an inn.
In the opening scene the audience
will be introduced to the Hardcastle
family composed of an old-fashioned
English country gentleman (Asher
Wilson), his snobbish wife (Margery
Bailey), Miss Hardcastle (Myna
Brunt on Hughes), her stepbrother,
Tony Lumpkin (Bud Cady) and her
cousin Miss Neville (Betty Ann
Higgins).
TONY MISDIRECTS
Tony, who is described as an oaf
and a lout, misdirects young Mar
low (Lorne Stanley), Miss Hard
castle's suitor, and his friend Mr.
Hastings (Richard Glyer), to the
Hardcastle home.
Marlow and Hastings, thinking
they have arrived at an inn, treat
the Hardcastles as innkeepers and
servants, and confuse the issue with f
their demanding attitudes. Further
complications arise when Marlow
meets his sweetheart. Marlow is or
dinarily bashful with ladies, but J
bold with barmaids, and he mistakes j
his sweetheart for the latter.
MOKE COMPLICATIONS
Meanwhile, Tony is supposed to I
marry Miss Neville, whom he hates, j
while she in turn falls in love with j
Hastings. Mama Hardcastle discov- j
ers this and the play winds up with |
a hilarious climax involving a jewel J
theft and a merry chase all over* the \
shire.
