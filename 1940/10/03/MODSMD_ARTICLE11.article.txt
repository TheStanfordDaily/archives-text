# Whitaker Speaks On Radio Hour
## 
### 
'"Through Books to Men" was the
subject of the talk given on the
Stanford Hour yesterday over Sta
tion KPO by Virgil K. Whitaker, as
sistant professor of English.
Dr. Whitaker in his discussion
showed that the best approach to
the better understanding of human
nature is through wide reading of
biography, d'ama, and fiction. To
prove that man is made more un
derstandable by the reading of fic
tion, he cited examples from the
works of Jane Austen, Sinclair
Lewis, and George Eliot.
