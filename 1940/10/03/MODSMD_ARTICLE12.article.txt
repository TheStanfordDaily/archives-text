# Avery, Mack Revise Files; Appoint Aids
## Committee Members To Be Rated; Cards To Cover Interests 
### 
Steaming ahead on the heat of
success, Betty Aveiy and Jim Mack
brought the idea of a revamped ac
tivity files to a state of actuality yes
terday by sending the form for the
new card to the mimeographers, and
appointing a committee to supervise
women's activities files.
The new card is designed to abol
ish the old unsatisfactory system of
interviews which required students
to wait in line for a brief interview
with a person whom they did not
know. Each student will now fill in
his own blank, giving a full account
of the activities he participated in at
high school, and listing the college
activities he is interested in.
The activities will be numbered in
the order of preference. Accom
panying the card will be an explana
tory sheet which describes all prin
cipal campus activities.
EVERYONE REACHED
Through the combined efforts of
Interclub Council, Interfraternity
Council, and all the sponsors in
Roble and Encina, Betty Avery and
Jim Mack intend to reach every man
and woman on the campus. For
merly freshmen only filled out an
activities card, which was put in a
file and promptly disregarded.
With the immediate probability of
an Ex Committee ruling making it
necessary for all committee mem
bers to have their names in the ac
tivity files and for all chairmen to
report back on the work of com
mittee members, Betty Avery hopes
to put teeth into the new system.
CROSS FILES EMPLOYED
Cross filing according to class, ac
tivity interests, as well as alphabet
ical listing, will be the basis of the
new system. Ex Committee may ap
point as activities co-ordinator a
senior man who will see that the
files are used by requiring commit
tee heads to sign a slip stating that
they have used the files. Chairmen
will give committee members a let
ter gradeâ€”from "A" to "F".
Appointees to the new, women's
activities committee are Ann Stein,
Mary Lou Hyatt, Dode Paulman,
Natalie Boyle, Madeleine Robb, Jan
ice Bradbury, Phyllis Richards, and
Elizabeth Robbins.
Cards are expected back from the
mimeographer on Monday, Oct. 14.
Cards for the women's living groups
will be distributed at Women's
Council meeting, and filled out that
night. After the cards have been
filled out, the files will be put in
working order and submitted to Ex
Committee for approval.
