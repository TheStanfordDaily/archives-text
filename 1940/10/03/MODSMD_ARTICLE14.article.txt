# Barclay Speaks On Campaigns At Lunch Club
## G.O.P. Convention Riot and Democratic Ill-humor Contrasted 
### 
Vivid contrast between the ex
cited spontaneity of the Republican
National Convention and the sullen
acquiescence of the Democratic del
egates at Chicago was drawn yes
terday by Professor Thomas S. Bar
clay at Luncheon Club.
Discussing "The Two Conven
tions," Mr. Barclay, of the political
science department, was guest
speaker in the Nitery at the first
of the club's weekly Wednesday
meetings. Professor Barclay was
an official observer at the Phila
delphia convention, and a delegate
from California to the Democratic
parley.
Willkie, according to Mr. Barclay,
in no sense measured up to the
"qualifications of eligibility."
the first place, he was an active
Democrat until 1936. In addition, a
$75,000-a-year utilities executive
would have been, under normal
circumstances, absolutely out of the
question.
THE BEST AVAILABLE
"However," Mr. Barclay said, "the
delegates felt that he was the only
candidate who could swap Roose
velt blow for blow. He was color
ful, aggressive, and an industrial
organizer who would take a chance/'
Professor Barclay cited several
"negative" factors which favored
Willkie's nomination. Among these
were (1) the early and complete
collapse of Dewey support, (2) the
certainty of the delegates that old
line politician Taft could not win
against Roosevelt.
Turning to the Democratic con
vention, Mr. Barclay said that Far
ley forced the convention to call the
role of states, thereby killing Roo
sevelt's nomination by acclamation.
The result was that Senator Lister
Hill of Alabama made the "most
atrocious nomination speech in his
tory."
STRONG PRESSURE
In the vice-presidential nomina
tions, the Republicans "took care of
the disgruntled elements" in the
old-time fashion," Professor Bar
clay said. However, the Democrats
made no such gesture. "Remote
control was exercised from Wash
ington for ex-Republican Wallace."
"And that," declared Professor
Barclay, "was when they got to
yelling, and they yelled mostly at
themselves."
