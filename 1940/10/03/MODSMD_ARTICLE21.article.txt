# Stanford Forum To Meet Tonight
## 
### 
Stanford Forum, newly organized
town-hall organization, will meet in
committee for the first time tonight
at 7:15 o'clock in the Women's Club
house. All those interested in
formation of the Forum are wel
come.
The Forum will conduct two
meetings each quarter, at which
prominent student leaders and pub
lic figures of the Bay region will
speak, according to Bob Peckham,
temporary chairman.
The new Forum has been started
on campus to fill the need left by
the degeneration of the old Stanford
Political Union, which broke up last
spring.
