# Daily Novices To Meet Today For Discussion
## Tryoutees to Hear Cannon on Methods Of News Coverage 
### 
Future members of the Daily's
Edit Board will gather for their
second tryoutee meeting this after
noon at 5 o'clock in Room 8 of the
Press Building. Potential reporters
will hear Wilson Cannon, associate
editor, talk on news coverage and
"How to Write a News Story."
Anyone unable to attend this
meeting or anyone wishing to try
out should get in touch with Mary
Etta Farrell, women's editor, who
is in charge of the tryoutees.
The Daily Shack has been prac
tically swamped with energetic try
outees. Staff members who for
merly only had to yell are now com
plaining that now they have to
scream to make themselves heard.
The novices seem to have agreed
among themselves that "everyone
grabs for himself" for copy and
proof are snatched up even before
they hit the copy desk.
During their instruction period,
students will be assigned stories to
cover and short quizzes on proof
reading, copy writing, and campus
news sources. Tryoutees will be
admitted to the staff on the basis
of the work they have done during
this two weeks' period and a final
examination.
