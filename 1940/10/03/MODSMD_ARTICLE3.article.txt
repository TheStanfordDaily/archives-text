# Axis Drive Over Egypt Is Foreseen
## British Claim Nazis Now 'Control' Italian Military Operations 
### 
LONDON, Oct. 2 (UP).â€”British
officials reported today the German
high command has taken "de
facto" charge of Italian military
operations and may be sending
troops to Italy for a joint Axis
drive across Egypt toward the
Suez Canal.
These reports indicating a strong
offensive to cut Britain's Mediter
ranean lifeline, were cited as pos
sible explanation for recent allega-

tions Italy is demanding control
over Syria and Lebanon, including
French air and naval bases.
"The German masters have taken
de facto charge of Italian opera
tions," British military leaders said.
"There is no reason why reports of
German troop movements to Italy
should not be true."
These quarters admitted they had
no specific information other than
previously Nazis admitted German
units were sent to the Italian front
to gain experience and give tech
nical assistance.
There was no indication the aerial
battle of Britain would slacken as
result of the apparent Axis plan to
shift the center of military opera
tions to the Mediterranean area.
The Ministry of Shipping said to
night the British Navy and Royal
Air Force have succeeded in keep
ing the eastern Mediterranean open
for British trade with the Near East,
particularly Egypt, Turkey, Cyprus,
and Greece and the Red Sea area
still is open to British shipping.
