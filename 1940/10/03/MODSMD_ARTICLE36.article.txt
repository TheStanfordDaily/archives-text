PUBLIC AUDITORIUM. CLEVE
LAND. Oct. 2 (UP). â€”Wendell L.
Willkie said tonight Germany, Japan
and Italy, "thinking of the United
States in terms of war, had come trf
believe we are neither a strong na
tion nor a great nation," because
the Roosevelt administration "played
politics with preparedness."
In a statement of the foreign pol
icy he would establish if elected
President, the Republican candidate
said this country must become so
strong no other nations "will dare to
strike at us."
Asserting the New Deal had
watched Adolf Hitler "advancing"
but had taken no adequate steps to
stiffen United States defenses, Will
kie said the task of preparedness
"before us is grim and hard" but
promised victory in the "Battle of
America, a battle to "release once
more the gigantic productive forces
of our people and to provide for
their impregnable defense."
