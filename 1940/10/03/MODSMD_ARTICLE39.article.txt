## 
### 
Coach Harry Maloney sent his 50-
odd charges through a strenuous
two-hour soccer practice yesterday,
in anticipation of their first game of
the season next Wednesday against
Menlo J. C.
Maloney has divided the huge
squad into four teams, but as yet
will not name a starting line-up.
"There are so many boys that are
about the same, that I can't decide
on a first team," said Maloney.
Practices will continue on Mon

days, Wednesdays, and Thursdays
for a while, Coach Maloney not j
wanting to work every day until the I
boys get into belter shape.
