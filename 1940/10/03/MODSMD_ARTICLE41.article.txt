# Cards Drill On Defense Minus Stahle, Orme
## Webfoot Eleven Unseasoned 
### 
Facing the chill wintry blasts,
Stanford's varsity football team
rolled through some contact work
to brush up on their own offense
and then took a look at Oregon's
attack in a lengthy defensive drill.
A team of fourth-stringers, di
rected by Assistant Coach Phil
Eengtson, who saw the Ducks in
action last Friday night, imperson
ated Tex Oliver's northerners. The
Cards received instruction from
Coach Clark Shaughnessy as to
their individual assignments con
cerning stopping the Webfeet's
mousetrappers through tackle and
guard and their numerous pass
plays.
Yesterday there was an uneven
exchange of injured men on the
Card practice field. The return of
Hank Norberg to uniform was un
favorably balanced by the appear
ance of Doug Stahle and Chick
Orme in street clothes. Norberg,
tough-luck kid of last year's frosh
outfit, will not be in line for any
tough work for several days be
cause of his ailing shoulder but he
was jogging around yesterday, get
ting back into shape after his two
week layoff.
INJURED RETURN
Both Stahle and Orme will be in
uniform for Saturday's tilt with
Oregon. But yesterday they con
fined their activities to looking and
listening. Orme received a bad
bruise earlier in the week and
Stahle was nursing a budding cold.
Reports concerning Oregon's
strength become more imposing each
day and Stanford's initial confer
ence game promises to be a crucial
one. True, the Webfeet's line is
pretty green, but it is big and
plenty tough and boasts Jim Stuart
at tackle, a fellow whom many ex
perts called the best tackle on the
Coast last year.
However, the backfield is expe
rienced as well as talented. Chet
Haliski; at quarter handles the
blocking assignments on those dev
astating mousetrappers and is also a
mighty fine punter. Both the half
backs, Cecil Isberg and Buck Berry,
are passers de luxe and will mix
aerial thrusts with their ball carry
ing. At fullback is rugged Marshall
Stenstrom. a plunging ball packer
who carries plenty of straight ahead
power.
A BENGTSON TIP
A newcomer to the Oregon squad
who has been threatening to break
into the starting backfield on his
performance when the Ducks turned
back the San Diego Marines is
Curley Mecham. Mecham is a
hustling little junior college trans
fer who looked particularly good
to Bengtson on his scouting trip
north and who is pressing the vet
eran Isberg for his starting job.
Shaughnessy, the maestro, has
naturally diagnosed the Oregon at
tack and has his solution for stop
ping the northerners. His tactics
are now, of course, a professional
secret, but the fans will see a dif
ferent kind of defense Saturday,
styled to stop the Ducks. Shaugh
nessy's defensive strategy and the
Cards' line charge ought to be
enough to stop any team's attack;
but don't fool yourself, Oregon is
going to be tough.
