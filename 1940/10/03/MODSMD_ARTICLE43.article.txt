## JERRY BRUCKER, Sports Editor Tigers Crush Cincinnati In World Series Opener 
### GEORGE KIRKSEY, United Press Correspondent 
CINCINNATI, Oct. 2 (UP). —An old familiar drama was replayed here
today and the Cincinnati citizens are getting tired of it.
The Detroit Tigers crushed the Cincinnati Reds, 7-2. in the opening
game of the 11)40 World Series while a crowd of 31,793 suffered in silence.
It was the same script the Yankees used here a year ago—blast the Reds'

| pitchers out of the box and
| American League power is too much j
1 for National League pitching and '
defense.
Instead of Keller, DiMaggio and
Dickey wielding the bats, it was Mc- |
Cosky, York and Campbell today, |
but the result was the same.
The American League's one big
inning style of play ruined big Paul
Derringer, Reds' veteran right- :
hander, who was considered by '
critics as one of the greatest money |
pitchers in the big show.
DERRINGER ROUTED
Derringer retired the Tigers in or
der in the first inning, but in the
second the Tigers routed Derringer
with a series of singles. When the
round was over the Tigers had five
runs, and five hits and after that it
was no contest.
With the second inning barrage off
Derringer, the Tigers practically won
the ball game before the throng that
packed Crosley Field had settled in j
the seats. After Derringer's down- :
fall, the poor Reds fans watched ;
| their heroes struggle weakly against I
the classy pitching of 80-Bo New-
I som, who toyed with the Reds be
hind the big' early lead supplied :
I him.
McCOSKEY'S GEM
The darkest moment for Newsom i
came at the start when Mike Mc- j
Cormick doubled after two were out. i
Then Frank McCormick, Reds' big ;
! first baseman, gave the Cincinnati
j crowd a momentary thrill. He
caught hold of one of Newsom's
fast ones, and smacked it deep into
center field. It was tagged extra j
bases, and looked like it might clear
the center field wall. But Barney I
! McCosky backed up against the
I center field barrier and with a one
handed stab plucked the ball off the
wall.
Newsom was breezing behind his
comfortable lead and was making
j good his pre-game boast he would
| beat the Reds and win his first J
| World Series start.
i TEN STRAIGHT
With the Tigers' triumph, the
American League has now inflicted
10 straight defeats on the National
League. Even the Yanks didn't beat
the Reds last fall as severely as the
Tigers did today. Derringer lost the
opener to the Yanks last year on j
j breaks, but today he was no mys-
J tery to the Tigers. Paul himself,
' who now has lost four World Series
j games without winning one, was '
mystified by his lack of effective
ness.

CINCINNATI, Oct. 2 (UP). —An old familiar drama was replayed here
today and the Cincinnati citizens are getting tired of it.
The Detroit Tigers crushed the Cincinnati Reds, 7-2. in the opening
game of the 11)40 World Series while a crowd of 31,793 suffered in silence.
It was the same script the Yankees used here a year ago—blast the Reds'

| pitchers out of the box and
| American League power is too much j
1 for National League pitching and '
defense.
Instead of Keller, DiMaggio and
Dickey wielding the bats, it was Mc- |
Cosky, York and Campbell today, |
but the result was the same.
The American League's one big
inning style of play ruined big Paul
Derringer, Reds' veteran right- :
hander, who was considered by '
critics as one of the greatest money |
pitchers in the big show.
DERRINGER ROUTED
Derringer retired the Tigers in or
der in the first inning, but in the
second the Tigers routed Derringer
with a series of singles. When the
round was over the Tigers had five
runs, and five hits and after that it
was no contest.
With the second inning barrage off
Derringer, the Tigers practically won
the ball game before the throng that
packed Crosley Field had settled in j
the seats. After Derringer's down- :
fall, the poor Reds fans watched ;
| their heroes struggle weakly against I
the classy pitching of 80-Bo New-
I som, who toyed with the Reds be
hind the big' early lead supplied :
I him.
McCOSKEY'S GEM
The darkest moment for Newsom i
came at the start when Mike Mc- j
Cormick doubled after two were out. i
Then Frank McCormick, Reds' big ;
! first baseman, gave the Cincinnati
j crowd a momentary thrill. He
caught hold of one of Newsom's
fast ones, and smacked it deep into
center field. It was tagged extra j
bases, and looked like it might clear
the center field wall. But Barney I
! McCosky backed up against the
I center field barrier and with a one
handed stab plucked the ball off the
wall.
Newsom was breezing behind his
comfortable lead and was making
j good his pre-game boast he would
| beat the Reds and win his first J
| World Series start.
i TEN STRAIGHT
With the Tigers' triumph, the
American League has now inflicted
10 straight defeats on the National
League. Even the Yanks didn't beat
the Reds last fall as severely as the
Tigers did today. Derringer lost the
opener to the Yanks last year on j
j breaks, but today he was no mys-
J tery to the Tigers. Paul himself,
' who now has lost four World Series
j games without winning one, was '
mystified by his lack of effective
ness.
