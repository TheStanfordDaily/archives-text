FOLLOWING are a few para
graphs taken from the column of
one Prescott Sullivan, sports scrib
bler for the San Francisco Examiner.
Ordinarily we wouldn't stoop this
low, but Mr. Sullivan deserves
worse because of the extremely un
complimentary remarks he has
made about Stanford and Coach
Clark Shaughnessy.
Besides, it shows how wrong a man
can be who gets paid for writing
sports, so perhaps when we boot a
couple people will be lenient. Mr.
Sullivan's sage remarks follow:
"Sixty-one to nothing has been
fixed as par for beating Stanford
as an outgrowth of Shaughnessy's
farewell season at the University
of Chicago last year. . . .
"U.S.F. will be the first to test the
new par. The Dons figure to be
better than so-so this year, but we
seriously doubt that they will do as
well as Harvard and Ohio State did
against the Shaughnessy system and
we are virtually certain they won't
approach Michigan's success which,
as you may recall, was 85 to 0.
"Frankly we don't expect the
Dons to win by more than a harnl-
I'lill of touchdowns. Offhand we'd
take 28 to 0 as iust about the
right score. That, of course, won't
win U.S.F. any. Fact is it will be
quite a comedown for the Dons,
who regard themselves as the
equal of Harvard if. indeed, they
aren't of a size with Ohio State.
"... the Dons should not feel too
badly should they fall short of a
whopper score. On the contrary
they should take what then can get
and be content to start Shaughnessy
on his way with a moral victory of
a kind which, we believe, Stanford
is going to score quite a few."
That was quite a moral victory,
Mr. Sullivan. We only hope that
you were right for once, and Stan
ford will score quite a few of them.
You weren't the only expert that
got fooled last Saturday, but you
were further oIT the path than any
others.
The sad part about the whole
thing is that, while you had the
wrong team, you came within one
point of naming the final score. In
passing, who do you think will win
the World Series, Mr. Sullivan? I
want, to bet on the other team.

well as Harvard and Ohio State did
against the Shaughnessy system and
we are virtually certain they won't
approach Michigan's success which,
as you may recall, was 85 to 0.
"Frankly we don't expect the
Dons to win by more than a harnl-
I'lill of touchdowns. Offhand we'd
take 28 to 0 as iust about the
right score. That, of course, won't
win U.S.F. any. Fact is it will be
quite a comedown for the Dons,
who regard themselves as the
equal of Harvard if. indeed, they
aren't of a size with Ohio State.
"... the Dons should not feel too
badly should they fall short of a
whopper score. On the contrary
they should take what then can get
and be content to start Shaughnessy
on his way with a moral victory of
a kind which, we believe, Stanford
is going to score quite a few."
That was quite a moral victory,
Mr. Sullivan. We only hope that
you were right for once, and Stan
ford will score quite a few of them.
You weren't the only expert that
got fooled last Saturday, but you
were further oIT the path than any
others.
The sad part about the whole
thing is that, while you had the
wrong team, you came within one
point of naming the final score. In
passing, who do you think will win
the World Series, Mr. Sullivan? I
want, to bet on the other team.
FOLLOWING are a few para
graphs taken from the column of
one Prescott Sullivan, sports scrib
bler for the San Francisco Examiner.
Ordinarily we wouldn't stoop this
low, but Mr. Sullivan deserves
worse because of the extremely un
complimentary remarks he has
made about Stanford and Coach
Clark Shaughnessy.
Besides, it shows how wrong a man
can be who gets paid for writing
sports, so perhaps when we boot a
couple people will be lenient. Mr.
Sullivan's sage remarks follow:
"Sixty-one to nothing has been
fixed as par for beating Stanford
as an outgrowth of Shaughnessy's
farewell season at the University
of Chicago last year. . . .
"U.S.F. will be the first to test the
new par. The Dons figure to be
better than so-so this year, but we
seriously doubt that they will do as
well as Harvard and Ohio State did
against the Shaughnessy system and
we are virtually certain they won't
approach Michigan's success which,
as you may recall, was 85 to 0.
