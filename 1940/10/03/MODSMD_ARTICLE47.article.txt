# Bulldogs Open Frosh Season
## 
### 
When Stanford's 1940 I'apoose
eleven goes onto the turf in the
Stadium at 12:15 o'clock Satur
day, they will fate one of the top
teams in the northern California
junior college conferenceâ€”the San
Mateo Bulldogs.
The Bulldogs, coached by "Furi- |
out; Murius McFadden, will field al
most an entire veteran outfit, most
of the first team members being
holdovers from last season's team
which turned in a record of nine
games won as against two lost.
Three of the outstanding players
lon the S.M.J.C. eleven are Juny
Head, a light halfback, Clay Ben
i ham, a fullback, and Bud Weekes, !
an end. Head is the brother of J
Gordy Head, former Stanford grid- '
der.
Starting line-up for the Bulldogs
will probably be Weekes and Rocky
Robatham at ends, Fred Boeusch
and Don Huff at tackles, Sammy
tSeers and Pete Cardinale at
guards, Howard Adler at center,
Jack LeLange at quarter, Lyle Tag
gart at left half, Head at right half,
and Benham at full.
On the frosh practice field yes- j
terday, Coach Harry Shipkey sent
his frosh gridders through their
final contact work of the week.
After a session on pass offense, the
Papoose squad engaged in a scrim
mage which featured pass plays.
Absent from the scrum were Jim
Troup and Frank Forbes, right and
left halfbacks, respectively. Both
Troup, who is being bothered by a
gimpy ankle, and Forbes, who has
a shoulder injury, will probably see
action Saturday. Loren LaPrade,
first team center with a slight
shoulder bruise, will definitely play
Saturday.
