In the interests of free discussion and criti
cism, The Daily presents this editorial which
appeared in The Beverly Hills Citizen. It was
written by Bill Rogers, publisher of that
paper, Stanford graduate, and son of the late
Will Rogers. This is not necessarily an ex
pression of official Stanford Daily editorial
policy. In order that opponents of Mr. Rogers'
point of view may be represented egually in
these columns, Mr. George Hislop, managing
editor of The Daily, cadet First Lieutenant in
the Stanford R.O.T.C. unit, and secretary of
Scabbard and Blade, will answer these words
tomorrow. —The Editor.
• /
BETWEEN now and the middle of October,
sixteen and a half million men will be
registered, and by the middle of November
or December some four hundred thousand of
them will be drafted into the regular U.S. army
for one year of training.
Now the writer of this editorial is eminently
qualified for this conscription. He comes under
it in every way. Furthermore he is in complete
agreement with it. . . .
BUT—and here we come to the reason for
this editorial—he sincerely hopes that the con
sidered sacrifice that he may have to make, and
that some four hundred thousand will have to
make, is not going to be squandered by the
U.S. army bureaucracy.
We have had some experience with the U.S.
army, and, frankly, we don't think very much
of the U.S. army system. It is more than old
fashioned; it is fossilized. It is more than inef
ficient; it is criminally wasteful of the energy
of its young men. It is more than bogged down
by red tape; it has been completely stopped
by its own "scared of the consequences" lack
of initiative.
A person doesn't mind doing his share, if he
can see that his share is not being wasted.
People will work with a will, with heroic effort
if need be, when they can see results or the
prospects of results. You can't expect the
French to go out and kill themselves for a man
like Daladier. However, you can expect the
British to endure most anything for a man like
Churchill.
The U.S. army system has for years been
pouring the enthusiasm of its young men down
the filing cabinets with the result that you would
expect.
In 1933, when Hitler was just starting to train
his German army with dummy tanks and dum
my airplanes, the U.S. cavalry troops, of which
we were one, were being trained to drill with
the saber.
Two years later, when Hitler's army was be
ginning to get real equipment, U.S. Artillery
Reserve officers were learning to groom horses,
and we stood around amazed looking at one of
the new motorized French 75's, of which there
were only three on the coast.
In fact we remember an artillery trip that
left the Presidio of Monterey one morning at the
crack of dawn. We hitched up the horses to
the caissons and the batteries and drove all
day—being careful to keep to one side of the
road so the automobiles could whiz past.
By evening we were a couple of miles past
the Del Monte Hotel. We made camp, unhitched
the horses, fed them, watered them, and pitched
our tents. Someone wanted to go back and get
his flashlight, so he borrowed a car from the
hot-dog stand that was near the camp, drove to
the Presidio, and was back in about twenty
minutes—before he was missed.
That was the way the whole expedition went.
It was a "dream-world," "make-believe," trip
from beginning to end. There wasn't an enemy
behind every bush, there was a Good Humor
Man.
We were supposed to be out defending the
town of Monterey from the "blues," but we
were apparently defending the Monterey of
the original State Capital, before roads were
paved and the telephone invented. As far as
our army activities went, the only contact we
had with civilization and science was when we
boldly drove those old artillery plugs down the
main street through the traffic red lights.
Of course there were some plausible reasons
for this lack of modernization. The U.S. Army
is designed not so much for defense as to form
the nucleus of an expeditionary force. As such
it must be primarily prepared to fight where
there are no paved roads. And, as for the
R.0.T.C., of which we were speaking, there is
certainly no need to spend a lot of money to
get modern equipment for a lot of college punks
to wreck, especially when there are millions
of dollars worth of old World War equipment
lying around. The R.O.T.C. is nothing but a
glorified fraternity, and most of its "young offi
cers' will probably turn out to be draft dodgers.

These are all true reasons, but the answer is—
the U.S. Army should then either fish or cut
bait. Either train officers or forget the whole
thing; teach them, teach us, how to fix a motor
and operate a portable radio, not to curry a
horse or polish a saber, or else drop the matter
and go back to those forms in triplicate.
If you show men how to operate new modern
equipment, things they know will be useful not
only in the army but in civilian life, you will get
enthusiastic co-operation and volunteer learn
ing. If you don't, you won't. The only time we
ever saw any pep or energy around the R.O.T.C.
was preparing for the annual "Officers' Ball.'-'
Having some four hundred thousand young
men admitted to the army can be a good thing
for it. It can be like a breath of fresh air in a
stifled room. For the army to get four hundred
thousand men, none of whom has had his men
tal growth stunted by West Point, should do
wonders in raising its I.Q. This influx of new
blood' can, if allowed, bring to the army the
experimentalism, the scientific skill, the techni
cal competence and the brain power it tradi
tionally lacks.
Between now and the middle of November,
an incalculable amount of youthful pep, en
thusiasm and energy is going to be poured into
our armed forces. We hope that our West Point
generals have learned a lesson since May 10,
and that they will place this energy behind
sound-directed anti-aircraft guns, and not be
hind muzzle-loaders.
BUT—until there is a drastic shake-up in our
army, comparable to the recent shake-up in pub
lic opinion—we have our doubts. For our per
sonal experience is that our West Point officers
have the worst heads for figures and the best
polished shoes in the business.
Strong words, Mister, but they should be
said now, when we can afford the luxury of
criticism, not later, when the nation will need
every ounce of unity it can get.—Bill Rogers.

If you show men how to operate new modern
equipment, things they know will be useful not
only in the army but in civilian life, you will get

Having some four hundred thousand young
men admitted to the army can be a good thing
for it. It can be like a breath of fresh air in a
stifled room. For the army to get four hundred
thousand men, none of whom has had his men
tal growth stunted by West Point, should do
wonders in raising its I.Q. This influx of new
blood' can, if allowed, bring to the army the
experimentalism, the scientific skill, the techni
cal competence and the brain power it tradi
tionally lacks.
Between now and the middle of November,
an incalculable amount of youthful pep, en
thusiasm and energy is going to be poured into
our armed forces. We hope that our West Point
generals have learned a lesson since May 10,
and that they will place this energy behind
sound-directed anti-aircraft guns, and not be
hind muzzle-loaders.
BUT—until there is a drastic shake-up in our
army, comparable to the recent shake-up in pub
lic opinion—we have our doubts. For our per
sonal experience is that our West Point officers
have the worst heads for figures and the best
polished shoes in the business.

BETWEEN now and the middle of October,
sixteen and a half million men will be
registered, and by the middle of November
or December some four hundred thousand of
them will be drafted into the regular U.S. army
for one year of training.
Now the writer of this editorial is eminently
qualified for this conscription. He comes under
it in every way. Furthermore he is in complete
agreement with it. . . .
BUT—and here we come to the reason for
this editorial—he sincerely hopes that the con
sidered sacrifice that he may have to make, and
that some four hundred thousand will have to
make, is not going to be squandered by the
U.S. army bureaucracy.
We have had some experience with the U.S.
army, and, frankly, we don't think very much
of the U.S. army system. It is more than old
fashioned; it is fossilized. It is more than inef
ficient; it is criminally wasteful of the energy
of its young men. It is more than bogged down
by red tape; it has been completely stopped
by its own "scared of the consequences" lack
of initiative.
A person doesn't mind doing his share, if he
can see that his share is not being wasted.
People will work with a will, with heroic effort
if need be, when they can see results or the
prospects of results. You can't expect the
French to go out and kill themselves for a man
like Daladier. However, you can expect the
British to endure most anything for a man like
Churchill.
The U.S. army system has for years been
pouring the enthusiasm of its young men down
the filing cabinets with the result that you would
expect.
In 1933, when Hitler was just starting to train
his German army with dummy tanks and dum
my airplanes, the U.S. cavalry troops, of which
we were one, were being trained to drill with
the saber.
Two years later, when Hitler's army was be
ginning to get real equipment, U.S. Artillery
Reserve officers were learning to groom horses,
and we stood around amazed looking at one of
the new motorized French 75's, of which there
were only three on the coast.
In fact we remember an artillery trip that
left the Presidio of Monterey one morning at the
crack of dawn. We hitched up the horses to
the caissons and the batteries and drove all
day—being careful to keep to one side of the
road so the automobiles could whiz past.
By evening we were a couple of miles past
the Del Monte Hotel. We made camp, unhitched
the horses, fed them, watered them, and pitched
our tents. Someone wanted to go back and get
his flashlight, so he borrowed a car from the
hot-dog stand that was near the camp, drove to
the Presidio, and was back in about twenty
minutes—before he was missed.
That was the way the whole expedition went.
It was a "dream-world," "make-believe," trip
from beginning to end. There wasn't an enemy
behind every bush, there was a Good Humor
Man.
We were supposed to be out defending the
town of Monterey from the "blues," but we
were apparently defending the Monterey of
the original State Capital, before roads were
paved and the telephone invented. As far as
our army activities went, the only contact we
had with civilization and science was when we
boldly drove those old artillery plugs down the
main street through the traffic red lights.
Of course there were some plausible reasons
for this lack of modernization. The U.S. Army
is designed not so much for defense as to form
the nucleus of an expeditionary force. As such
it must be primarily prepared to fight where
there are no paved roads. And, as for the
R.0.T.C., of which we were speaking, there is
certainly no need to spend a lot of money to
get modern equipment for a lot of college punks
to wreck, especially when there are millions
of dollars worth of old World War equipment
lying around. The R.O.T.C. is nothing but a
glorified fraternity, and most of its "young offi
cers' will probably turn out to be draft dodgers.

These are all true reasons, but the answer is—
the U.S. Army should then either fish or cut
bait. Either train officers or forget the whole
thing; teach them, teach us, how to fix a motor
and operate a portable radio, not to curry a
horse or polish a saber, or else drop the matter
and go back to those forms in triplicate.

By evening we were a couple of miles past
the Del Monte Hotel. We made camp, unhitched
the horses, fed them, watered them, and pitched
our tents. Someone wanted to go back and get
his flashlight, so he borrowed a car from the
hot-dog stand that was near the camp, drove to
the Presidio, and was back in about twenty
minutes—before he was missed.
That was the way the whole expedition went.
It was a "dream-world," "make-believe," trip
from beginning to end. There wasn't an enemy
behind every bush, there was a Good Humor
Man.
We were supposed to be out defending the
town of Monterey from the "blues," but we
were apparently defending the Monterey of
the original State Capital, before roads were
paved and the telephone invented. As far as
our army activities went, the only contact we
had with civilization and science was when we
boldly drove those old artillery plugs down the
main street through the traffic red lights.
Of course there were some plausible reasons
for this lack of modernization. The U.S. Army
is designed not so much for defense as to form
the nucleus of an expeditionary force. As such
it must be primarily prepared to fight where
there are no paved roads. And, as for the
R.0.T.C., of which we were speaking, there is
certainly no need to spend a lot of money to
get modern equipment for a lot of college punks
to wreck, especially when there are millions
of dollars worth of old World War equipment
lying around. The R.O.T.C. is nothing but a
glorified fraternity, and most of its "young offi
cers' will probably turn out to be draft dodgers.

These are all true reasons, but the answer is—
the U.S. Army should then either fish or cut
bait. Either train officers or forget the whole
thing; teach them, teach us, how to fix a motor
and operate a portable radio, not to curry a
horse or polish a saber, or else drop the matter
and go back to those forms in triplicate.
If you show men how to operate new modern
equipment, things they know will be useful not
only in the army but in civilian life, you will get
enthusiastic co-operation and volunteer learn
ing. If you don't, you won't. The only time we
ever saw any pep or energy around the R.O.T.C.
was preparing for the annual "Officers' Ball.'-'
Having some four hundred thousand young
men admitted to the army can be a good thing
for it. It can be like a breath of fresh air in a
stifled room. For the army to get four hundred
thousand men, none of whom has had his men
tal growth stunted by West Point, should do
wonders in raising its I.Q. This influx of new
blood' can, if allowed, bring to the army the
experimentalism, the scientific skill, the techni
cal competence and the brain power it tradi
tionally lacks.
Between now and the middle of November,
an incalculable amount of youthful pep, en
thusiasm and energy is going to be poured into
our armed forces. We hope that our West Point
generals have learned a lesson since May 10,
and that they will place this energy behind
sound-directed anti-aircraft guns, and not be
hind muzzle-loaders.
BUT—until there is a drastic shake-up in our
army, comparable to the recent shake-up in pub
lic opinion—we have our doubts. For our per
sonal experience is that our West Point officers
have the worst heads for figures and the best
polished shoes in the business.

BETWEEN now and the middle of October,
sixteen and a half million men will be
registered, and by the middle of November
or December some four hundred thousand of
them will be drafted into the regular U.S. army
for one year of training.
Now the writer of this editorial is eminently
qualified for this conscription. He comes under
it in every way. Furthermore he is in complete
agreement with it. . . .
BUT—and here we come to the reason for
this editorial—he sincerely hopes that the con
sidered sacrifice that he may have to make, and
that some four hundred thousand will have to
make, is not going to be squandered by the
U.S. army bureaucracy.
We have had some experience with the U.S.
army, and, frankly, we don't think very much
of the U.S. army system. It is more than old
fashioned; it is fossilized. It is more than inef
ficient; it is criminally wasteful of the energy
of its young men. It is more than bogged down
by red tape; it has been completely stopped
by its own "scared of the consequences" lack
of initiative.
A person doesn't mind doing his share, if he
can see that his share is not being wasted.
People will work with a will, with heroic effort
if need be, when they can see results or the
prospects of results. You can't expect the
French to go out and kill themselves for a man
like Daladier. However, you can expect the
British to endure most anything for a man like
Churchill.
The U.S. army system has for years been
pouring the enthusiasm of its young men down
the filing cabinets with the result that you would
expect.
In 1933, when Hitler was just starting to train
his German army with dummy tanks and dum
my airplanes, the U.S. cavalry troops, of which
we were one, were being trained to drill with
the saber.
Two years later, when Hitler's army was be
ginning to get real equipment, U.S. Artillery
Reserve officers were learning to groom horses,
and we stood around amazed looking at one of
the new motorized French 75's, of which there
were only three on the coast.
In fact we remember an artillery trip that
left the Presidio of Monterey one morning at the
crack of dawn. We hitched up the horses to
the caissons and the batteries and drove all
day—being careful to keep to one side of the
road so the automobiles could whiz past.
By evening we were a couple of miles past
the Del Monte Hotel. We made camp, unhitched
the horses, fed them, watered them, and pitched

make, is not going to be squandered by the
U.S. army bureaucracy.
We have had some experience with the U.S.
army, and, frankly, we don't think very much
of the U.S. army system. It is more than old
fashioned; it is fossilized. It is more than inef
ficient; it is criminally wasteful of the energy
of its young men. It is more than bogged down
by red tape; it has been completely stopped
by its own "scared of the consequences" lack
of initiative.
A person doesn't mind doing his share, if he
can see that his share is not being wasted.
People will work with a will, with heroic effort
if need be, when they can see results or the
prospects of results. You can't expect the
French to go out and kill themselves for a man
like Daladier. However, you can expect the
British to endure most anything for a man like
Churchill.
The U.S. army system has for years been
pouring the enthusiasm of its young men down
the filing cabinets with the result that you would
expect.
In 1933, when Hitler was just starting to train
his German army with dummy tanks and dum
my airplanes, the U.S. cavalry troops, of which
we were one, were being trained to drill with
the saber.
Two years later, when Hitler's army was be
ginning to get real equipment, U.S. Artillery
Reserve officers were learning to groom horses,
and we stood around amazed looking at one of
the new motorized French 75's, of which there
were only three on the coast.
In fact we remember an artillery trip that
left the Presidio of Monterey one morning at the
crack of dawn. We hitched up the horses to
the caissons and the batteries and drove all
day—being careful to keep to one side of the
road so the automobiles could whiz past.
By evening we were a couple of miles past
the Del Monte Hotel. We made camp, unhitched
the horses, fed them, watered them, and pitched
our tents. Someone wanted to go back and get
his flashlight, so he borrowed a car from the
hot-dog stand that was near the camp, drove to
the Presidio, and was back in about twenty
minutes—before he was missed.
That was the way the whole expedition went.
It was a "dream-world," "make-believe," trip
from beginning to end. There wasn't an enemy
behind every bush, there was a Good Humor
Man.
We were supposed to be out defending the
town of Monterey from the "blues," but we
were apparently defending the Monterey of
the original State Capital, before roads were
paved and the telephone invented. As far as
our army activities went, the only contact we
had with civilization and science was when we
boldly drove those old artillery plugs down the
main street through the traffic red lights.
Of course there were some plausible reasons
for this lack of modernization. The U.S. Army
is designed not so much for defense as to form
the nucleus of an expeditionary force. As such
it must be primarily prepared to fight where
there are no paved roads. And, as for the
R.0.T.C., of which we were speaking, there is
certainly no need to spend a lot of money to
get modern equipment for a lot of college punks
to wreck, especially when there are millions
of dollars worth of old World War equipment
lying around. The R.O.T.C. is nothing but a
glorified fraternity, and most of its "young offi
cers' will probably turn out to be draft dodgers.

These are all true reasons, but the answer is—
the U.S. Army should then either fish or cut
bait. Either train officers or forget the whole
thing; teach them, teach us, how to fix a motor
and operate a portable radio, not to curry a
horse or polish a saber, or else drop the matter
and go back to those forms in triplicate.
If you show men how to operate new modern
equipment, things they know will be useful not
only in the army but in civilian life, you will get
enthusiastic co-operation and volunteer learn
ing. If you don't, you won't. The only time we
ever saw any pep or energy around the R.O.T.C.
was preparing for the annual "Officers' Ball.'-'
Having some four hundred thousand young
men admitted to the army can be a good thing
for it. It can be like a breath of fresh air in a
stifled room. For the army to get four hundred
thousand men, none of whom has had his men
tal growth stunted by West Point, should do
wonders in raising its I.Q. This influx of new
blood' can, if allowed, bring to the army the
experimentalism, the scientific skill, the techni
cal competence and the brain power it tradi
tionally lacks.
Between now and the middle of November,
an incalculable amount of youthful pep, en
thusiasm and energy is going to be poured into
our armed forces. We hope that our West Point
generals have learned a lesson since May 10,
and that they will place this energy behind
sound-directed anti-aircraft guns, and not be
hind muzzle-loaders.
BUT—until there is a drastic shake-up in our
army, comparable to the recent shake-up in pub
lic opinion—we have our doubts. For our per
sonal experience is that our West Point officers
have the worst heads for figures and the best
polished shoes in the business.
Strong words, Mister, but they should be
said now, when we can afford the luxury of
criticism, not later, when the nation will need
every ounce of unity it can get.—Bill Rogers.

BETWEEN now and the middle of October,
sixteen and a half million men will be
registered, and by the middle of November
or December some four hundred thousand of
them will be drafted into the regular U.S. army
for one year of training.
Now the writer of this editorial is eminently
qualified for this conscription. He comes under
it in every way. Furthermore he is in complete
agreement with it. . . .
BUT—and here we come to the reason for
this editorial—he sincerely hopes that the con
sidered sacrifice that he may have to make, and
that some four hundred thousand will have to
make, is not going to be squandered by the
U.S. army bureaucracy.
