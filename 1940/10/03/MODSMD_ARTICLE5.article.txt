# BRITISH SMASH RAIDS OVER CENTRAL LONDON
## 
### 
LONDON, Thurs., Oct. 3 (UP). â€”
Bomb-laden German raiders early
today resorted to new "nutcracker"
tactics in an effort to reach the heart
of London but were beaten back by
thunderous anti-aircraft fire more
intense than any of recent days.
Arriving on time-table schedule
for their 26th night of assault, the
Nazi bombers tried repeatedly to
smash through the capital's "outer
ring" of defenses and before mid
night the eighth alarm of the day
had driven Londoners to shelters.
In a departure from their usual
tactics, the raiders attempted to
smash through to central London by
launching simultaneous waves from
two directions, skirting the suburbs
and suddenly swerving in toward the
heart of the city.
