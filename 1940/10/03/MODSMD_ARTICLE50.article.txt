# BULL SESSION
## 
### BUD AMES 
HE LOVES HIM, HE LOVES HIM NOT
JT MAY be contended that Willkie doesn't say much
that you can pigeon-hole, but at least he doesn't go
around saying unnecessary things. Barnum and Bailey
could probably find a nice spot for President Roose
velt in their tent show. Theie's always a good job
open to a man with two faces.
This whole discussion arose out of the little tragedy
that took place with lots of blood back in Michigan
a couple of days ago. It seems that a lovely little miss
with a heart of Democratic gold was overcome with a
good case of Roble hysteria of the Michigan type.
From the eighteenth floor of a skyscraper she watched
Willkie enthusiasts cheering the Republican candidate
in the street below. She simply got so excited that
she had to do something—so she threw a heavy waste
basket out the window. The 19-year-old girl that it
hit went to the hospital with a possible fractured skull.
When questioned, the basket tosser, who by the way
works(?) for the Reconstruction Finance Corporation,
made a couple of nifty quotes. She gurgled juicily,
"Everybody was throwing things so I just thought I'd
join in the fun."
Some fun. But who does the thinking in that
office?
♦ * * *
W/"HAT this all leads up to is the statement made a
few hours later concerning the incident by Presi
dent Roosevelt. Clucking like a hen, he oiled, "A most
regrettable occurrence. The young lady will probably
lose her job."
That's where you come in. You're supposed now to
say, "Well, now isn't that nice of President Roosevelt.
He can't be so bad making statements like that. I
think I'll rush right, out and vote for him."
In Pontiac, Michigan, somebody threw three eggs
at. Willkie. Roosevelt grabbed another chance to gurgle;
he commented publicly (as usual) on the "outrageous
act," and suggested that the culprits "be tracked down
and punished."
That's where you come in. You're supposed to say,
"Well, now ..." Don't bother; it's just theT same as
up above.

Mr. Roosevelt's actions belie his
words. For, all over the country, particularly in
the Middle West, a whispering campaign is beingf di
rected against Mr. Willkie. The same tactics were
used in defeating Mr. Landon four years back. Only
this campaign's whispers have taken a nastier twist.
Roosevelt cohorts are spreading the word that Will
kie is a German. Then they hang nasty implications
on it. Obviously, Mr. Willkie, who has been playing
in the big leagues for a long time now, foresaw such a
muddy campaign last summer. As a checkmate he
admitted that he came from German stock in his ac
ceptance speech. But Democratic representatives still
continue to spread the dirt.
Outwardly, Roosevelt kicks the people who take
punches at Willkie. Behind the scenes, his cohorts call
Willkie names. Very unnecessary, and extremely
dirty.

Mr. Roosevelt's actions belie his
words. For, all over the country, particularly in
the Middle West, a whispering campaign is beingf di
rected against Mr. Willkie. The same tactics were
used in defeating Mr. Landon four years back. Only
this campaign's whispers have taken a nastier twist.
Roosevelt cohorts are spreading the word that Will
kie is a German. Then they hang nasty implications
on it. Obviously, Mr. Willkie, who has been playing
in the big leagues for a long time now, foresaw such a
muddy campaign last summer. As a checkmate he
admitted that he came from German stock in his ac
ceptance speech. But Democratic representatives still
continue to spread the dirt.
Outwardly, Roosevelt kicks the people who take
punches at Willkie. Behind the scenes, his cohorts call
Willkie names. Very unnecessary, and extremely
dirty.
HE LOVES HIM, HE LOVES HIM NOT
JT MAY be contended that Willkie doesn't say much
that you can pigeon-hole, but at least he doesn't go
around saying unnecessary things. Barnum and Bailey
could probably find a nice spot for President Roose
velt in their tent show. Theie's always a good job
open to a man with two faces.
This whole discussion arose out of the little tragedy
that took place with lots of blood back in Michigan
a couple of days ago. It seems that a lovely little miss
with a heart of Democratic gold was overcome with a
good case of Roble hysteria of the Michigan type.
From the eighteenth floor of a skyscraper she watched
Willkie enthusiasts cheering the Republican candidate
in the street below. She simply got so excited that
she had to do something—so she threw a heavy waste
basket out the window. The 19-year-old girl that it
hit went to the hospital with a possible fractured skull.
When questioned, the basket tosser, who by the way
works(?) for the Reconstruction Finance Corporation,
made a couple of nifty quotes. She gurgled juicily,
"Everybody was throwing things so I just thought I'd
join in the fun."
Some fun. But who does the thinking in that
office?
♦ * * *
W/"HAT this all leads up to is the statement made a
few hours later concerning the incident by Presi
dent Roosevelt. Clucking like a hen, he oiled, "A most
regrettable occurrence. The young lady will probably
lose her job."
That's where you come in. You're supposed now to
say, "Well, now isn't that nice of President Roosevelt.
He can't be so bad making statements like that. I
think I'll rush right, out and vote for him."
In Pontiac, Michigan, somebody threw three eggs
at. Willkie. Roosevelt grabbed another chance to gurgle;
he commented publicly (as usual) on the "outrageous
act," and suggested that the culprits "be tracked down
and punished."
That's where you come in. You're supposed to say,
"Well, now ..." Don't bother; it's just theT same as
up above.
