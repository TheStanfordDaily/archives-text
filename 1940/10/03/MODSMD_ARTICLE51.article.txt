EDITOR, SIR:
We read with sympathy and understanding the note
appearing in Campus Opinion by The Three Lemons.
Being new students at Stanford, it seems that we three
are in the same predicament (no Dates this week).
We are very anxious and willing to make new friends;
therefore, we respectfully wish, and hope, that the
Three Lemons will in the old Stanford spirit of friend
ship communicate with us. Write Box 1906.
