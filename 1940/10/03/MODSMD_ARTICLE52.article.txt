# CHEER THE CHEERERS

THE EDITOR, SIR:
Let's have a little chatter, gang! We hear Gordie
Nicol plead at every game and rally. Well, this time
let's give the cheer leaders, Gordie, Joe, and Tom, a
little chatter for a neat piece of work. What would we
do without them? They're an important part of the
Indian Machine. When our boys are out there fightin'
they need us in back of them. Here's where the chat
ter comes in. Whether we are losing, in the lead, or
just in a temporary rut, they're keeping us all fired
up with the hope and prayer that something will
happen.
So off go our hats and here's a little chatter for
the three Chatter boys.
A Little Cheer, Roble Hall
