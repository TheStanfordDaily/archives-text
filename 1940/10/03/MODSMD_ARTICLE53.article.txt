# Osa's Book 'Adventure' Makes Interesting Movie
## 
### 
"I Married Adventure" and "Lucky Partners," now playing at the Stan
ford Theater.
Before we hop the next Green Jitney for Africa, let us give you a tip
on an hour and a half of fascinating shots of all sorts of animals you
see when you go "/.00-ing" and all sorts you don't.

Hollywood tore up a couple
old Martin Johnson movies and
pieced together a film that follows
Osa Johnson's recent book, "I Mar
ried Adventure." Most of the se
quences have not been shown before,
because the producer glued up cen- j
sored shots from previous pictures
to give life to Osa Johnson's tribute
to her husband, who died a year
ago.
Probably the fascination of such
a film is man's never-tiring interest j
in wild life. The fascination of this j
film lies in the fact that these are j
real experiences. The drama of life .
is nothing dreamed up by an author |
ensconced in a mahogany appointed
study; it is true, and its truth makes
it the more exciting.
HERE'S THE BIRD
Here's your chance to see the big
gest flock of wild flamingo ever
filmed. If you've never seen a
Übangi before, don't miss these wild
African shots. And confidentially
some of our rug-cutters could take
a jam tip from some of these Af
rican swingaroos when they truck
on down in best tribal style.
Osa is the star and by the way,
some of the best shots are hers,
when she acted as trigger man for
her husband. The story takes you
from the time of their marriage,
when Osa was 16 and ran away to
marry a man that took her to Bor
neo on a honeymoon, up to today.
This covers three trips to Africa and
two to Borneo, the last being made
by Sikorskys.
AND—OH, YES
Oh, yes, by the by, the main fea
ture is "Lucky Partners," starring
someone by the name of Ginger
Rogers and a gentleman named Ron
ald Coleman. We felt it was a good
thing they told us who was playing
because Miss Rogers' hair is now
black and droopy and they still
claim it is the same Ronald Coleman
who played in ''The Tale of Two
Cities." •
The whole fuss is over an artist
who takes a trip with an engaged
girl (engaged to another man) on a
purely platonic basis. You're slightly
suspicious through the whole fol
de-rol that the girl wishes it wasn't
(platonic we mean) and that the |
artist will fall in love with the girl
anyway.
ROUGH SPOTS
Through the slightly murky haze
of stilted acting, unsubtle bedroom
comedy and a few minor comedians
that aren't, the reviewer came to the
conclusion that aforementioned Miss
Rogers was not at her best and that
Mr. Coleman has been sold down the
river by some film company.
Lest our comments seem too
vitriolic, we realize that the script
was translated from a French ditty
and of course the French have such
a different way of saying things.—

is nothing dreamed up by an author |
ensconced in a mahogany appointed
study; it is true, and its truth makes
it the more exciting.
HERE'S THE BIRD
Here's your chance to see the big
gest flock of wild flamingo ever
filmed. If you've never seen a
Übangi before, don't miss these wild
African shots. And confidentially
some of our rug-cutters could take
a jam tip from some of these Af
rican swingaroos when they truck
on down in best tribal style.
Osa is the star and by the way,
some of the best shots are hers,
when she acted as trigger man for
her husband. The story takes you
from the time of their marriage,
when Osa was 16 and ran away to
marry a man that took her to Bor
neo on a honeymoon, up to today.
This covers three trips to Africa and
two to Borneo, the last being made
by Sikorskys.
AND—OH, YES
Oh, yes, by the by, the main fea
ture is "Lucky Partners," starring
someone by the name of Ginger
Rogers and a gentleman named Ron
ald Coleman. We felt it was a good
thing they told us who was playing
because Miss Rogers' hair is now
black and droopy and they still
claim it is the same Ronald Coleman
who played in ''The Tale of Two
Cities." •
The whole fuss is over an artist
who takes a trip with an engaged
girl (engaged to another man) on a
purely platonic basis. You're slightly
suspicious through the whole fol
de-rol that the girl wishes it wasn't
(platonic we mean) and that the |
artist will fall in love with the girl
anyway.
ROUGH SPOTS
Through the slightly murky haze
of stilted acting, unsubtle bedroom
comedy and a few minor comedians
that aren't, the reviewer came to the
conclusion that aforementioned Miss
Rogers was not at her best and that
Mr. Coleman has been sold down the
river by some film company.
Lest our comments seem too
vitriolic, we realize that the script
was translated from a French ditty
and of course the French have such
a different way of saying things.—

"I Married Adventure" and "Lucky Partners," now playing at the Stan
ford Theater.
Before we hop the next Green Jitney for Africa, let us give you a tip
on an hour and a half of fascinating shots of all sorts of animals you
see when you go "/.00-ing" and all sorts you don't.

Hollywood tore up a couple
old Martin Johnson movies and
pieced together a film that follows
Osa Johnson's recent book, "I Mar
ried Adventure." Most of the se
quences have not been shown before,
because the producer glued up cen- j
sored shots from previous pictures
to give life to Osa Johnson's tribute
to her husband, who died a year
ago.

a film is man's never-tiring interest j
