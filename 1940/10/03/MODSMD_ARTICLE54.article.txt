# 'Y' Campus Drive To Close Today
## 
### 
Today is the last day of the "Y"
membership drive. For the past
week fifty "Y" workers, under the
direction of B. J. Binney have been
canvassing all new women in hopes
of making the 1940 enrollment the
largest in years.
By joining the "Y" freshmen and
transfers will have access to any or
all of ten activities. Among these
discussion and activity groups are:
social service, headed by Betty
Augur; freshman discussion, led by
Elaine Raley; music group, led by
Dot Harr; marriage and the home,
led by Norma MacKenzie, and many
others.
A new group has also been added
this quarter. Under the direction of
Helen Severance this new group
will work in conjunction with the
Red Cross and British War Relief.
