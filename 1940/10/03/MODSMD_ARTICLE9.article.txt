# Stanford Grad Student Sees France Fall, Paris Evacuated
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Last May 27, Kizette De Lempicka, now a Stanford grad student, fin
ished her morning's work at the office of the Ministry of Propaganda for
the Polish Government in Paris, ate a leisurely lunch with some friends,
discussed her three weeks' vacation which she planned to spend in St.
Jean-de-Luz or Biarritz, sniffed in a rather bored fashion at an air-raid

alarm.
'That day the idea of German
invasion or even of real danger
seemed preposterous," she says.
But the next morning she was just
one of a stream of hundreds of
evacuees who were flooding the
roads leading toward southwestern
France. And then, just one of the
many struggling to find a place —
any place—to sleep in a Bordeaux,
already straining at the seams with
hordes of distracted government offi
cials. Just one standing for days in
a line trying to get Spanish and
Portuguese visas. Just one in a mile
long string of cars at the Spanish
border. Just one trying to get pass
age on a ship out of Lisbon.
"It's strange, but at the time I had
no feeling that I was what they call
a refugee," she laughs. "Of course,
I'd seen the Belgian refugee center
in Paris. There were so many that
they had to block off the street."
POLISH LINES
Born in St. Petersburg of Polish
parents, educated in France and at
St. Hilary's College at Oxford, Miss
De Lempicka was in charge of cin
ema and news reel propaganda for
the exiled Polish Government.
During the last year in Paris, the
feeling among the people was one
of complete confidence, according to
Miss De Lempicka. The popular
song of the day in both French and
English was:
"We're going to hang our wash
ing
On the Siegfried Line ..."
Orders to evacuate the propaganda
office came on the day that Leopold
surrendered. First the feeling was
one of complete bewilderment. Then
wild rumors began to circulate about
General Gamelin—that he'd been
captured, that he'd committed sui
cide, that he'd turned traitor.
NO CHEERING
In Bordeaux, Laval and Petain
were seen often in the cafes (food
was still plentiful there) but no
crowds cheered. It took just 20 days
for her and her sister to get the
various visas and permits necessary
to get out of the country.
On June 18, at 7 o'clock in the
morning, they reached the Pont Na
tionale, the bridge forming the bor
derline between France and Spain.
The line of cars stretched ahead of
them. During that nine-hour wait,
the feeling along the line was one
ol cameraderie and fellowship. Then
a car with a swastika drew up and
a Prussian-looking man with a cam
era carefully photographed the li
cense plate on every car. ("For the
German-propaganda office, I sup
pose.") They crossed the bridge into
Spain at 5 o'clock that evening.
ON THEIR HEELS
"The Germans reached Biarritz
two days later; and the frontier was
closed." she went on. "But we had
no idea they were so close. Neither
did the peasants in the country we
had just driven through. They
laughed at us for running away."
The De Lempickas finally got
passage on a Greek steamer, the
"Nca Hellas," and in late July reach
ed the home of her mother and
step-father in Beverly Hills.
"You do not know what it means
to us to see the lights of your New
York. It meant a friendly world
again. A world of peace, and free
dom. You can underline 'freedom',"
she said.
