and their government has given aid

While Americans show this desire
to help Britain, they have been slow
to recognize America's position as a
non-belligerent, especially as viewed
by Germany, Italy, and Japan.

A DOLPH HITLER and Benito
Mussolini were on their way to
Brenner Pass last night probably to
discuss new aspects of the war re
sulting from their alliance with
Japan. But authoritative sources in
both Berlin and Rome have inti
mated that the Axis partners will
consider the United States in her
present position, as a non-belliger
ent, committed to aid Britain, their
common enemy.
When Hitler and Mussolini last
met, on March 18, the United States
was far from giving all aid short of
war to Britain. The Axis dictators
hoped that the United States would
retain her attitude of complacency
and that she would not go further
in her aid to Britain.
But since the collapse of France
America's position has changed more
quickly than anyone dared predict
at that time. Now America is be

up the cry that has been coming
from the press in Tokyo and Berlin
for the past week—that the United
States should keep her distance both
in Europe and in Asia unless she
wishes to be "destroyed."
Whatever the outcome of the
impending meeting between Hitler
and Mussolini, it is clear that the
Axis has placed far more signifi

With the United States considered
as an enemy whose participation in
the present war neither Hitler nor
Mussolini cherishes, they may de
cide in their meeting to try to
"frighten" America again by issuing
another "far-reaching" pact that
will include Russia and Spain.
Thus, they will continue the war of
intimidation on the United States
through bellicose threats and the
signing of pacts that alter little the
present situation.
The meeting between Hitler and
Mussolini will be watched from this
side of the Atlantic with interest—
not with the apprehension that Axis

A DOLPH HITLER and Benito
Mussolini were on their way to
Brenner Pass last night probably to
discuss new aspects of the war re
sulting from their alliance with
Japan. But authoritative sources in
both Berlin and Rome have inti

consider the United States in her
present position, as a non-belliger

common enemy.
When Hitler and Mussolini last
met, on March 18, the United States
was far from giving all aid short of
war to Britain. The Axis dictators
hoped that the United States would
retain her attitude of complacency
and that she would not go further
in her aid to Britain.
But since the collapse of France
America's position has changed more
quickly than anyone dared predict
at that time. Now America is be
