# 'WILLKIE FAVORED' Farm Votes 'Yes' 73 Per Cent

Stanford wants Wendell L. Willkie as President of the United
States.
In a survey of campus opinion conducted by The Daily
yesterday, 73 per cent of all students questioned were found
to be for Willkie, 26 per cent for Franklin D. Roosevelt, and
1 per cent for Socialist Norman Thomas and other candidates.
No surprise are these results to campus political observers,
but significant is the fact that in 1936 only 55 per cent of the
same students were for Alfred Landon, while 33 per cent favored
; Roosevelt and 12 per cent Thomas. Even more rock-ribbed Re
-1 publican are today's Farm students than in 1932 when only 55
per cent were for Herbert Hoover, while Roosevelt and Thomas
shared almost evenly the remaining votes.
Women favor Willkie more strongly than the men, as is indi
cated by the following:
Willkie Roosevelt Others
Women 80% 20% 0%
Men 70% 29% 1%
(Any percentage less than .5 is considered 0.)
Almost no difference in opinion is found between Hall and
Row students. But no unanimity is present within the ranks of
independent students, who are divided in their choice. Willkie
was named by 73 per cent of the Hall affiliates and Roosevelt by
27 per cent; 76 per cent of the Row chose the Republican candi
date, only 24 per cent for Roosevelt.
Freshmen and graduate students, neither of which are con
sidered Hall or Row, voted as follows:
Willkie Roosevelt Others
Freshmen 86% 14% 0%
Graduates . 75% 25% 0%
Student comments were mostly critical, with President Roose
velt the victim of most of the disparaging remarks. He was
j called "dictator," "power-mad," "war-monger," and some un
printable names. The Roosevelt advocates aimed their remarks
at "Willkie's mud-slinging" and as a Lagunita sophomore said,
"Willkie's speeches stink."
These facts were secured through a survey of campus student
opinion conducted by The Stanford Daily by means of a scientifi
cally compiled cross-section of Stanford students. Factors con
sidered were sex, class, affiliation with Row, Hall, or Independent
(living in private residence or at home). Each classified group
was polled in proportion to its total representation on campus.
(Ed. Note.â€”This is the first in a series of reports on a recent
; poll of student opinion. Tabulations on other subjects will
follow in early issues.)
