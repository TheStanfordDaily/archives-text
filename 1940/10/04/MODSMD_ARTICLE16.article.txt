# Farm Juggles Dates; Shifts Thanksgiving
## Change Eliminates Holiday During Big Game Week Program 
### 
Stanford will have its traditional
Big Game week in 1940 uninter
rupted by a Thanksgiving holiday
though it means observing Roose
velt's artificial holiday, according to
announcement yesterday by Dr.
Ray Lyman Wilbur.
This is contrary to the calendar
printed by the University in the
1940-11 Announcement of Courses,
but the change was made necessary
by the scheduling of the Big Game
for November 30.
NOT THE NEW DEAL
Stanford has not thereby gone
New Deal, but traditions and finan
cial implications of the Big Game
have made it necessary to change
the University holiday.
Those who did not purchase root
ers' tickets because they expected
the game to come during the holi
day may put their names on a wait
ing list at the BA.C.
Dr. Wilbur's announcement yes
terday will set at ease the many
student minds who had envisioned
a Big Game during a holiday with
the necessary devaluation of the
rally, parade and bonfire.
