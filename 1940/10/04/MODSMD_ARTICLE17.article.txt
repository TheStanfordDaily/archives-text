PITTSBURGH, Oct. 3 (UP).â€”
Attorney General Robert Jackson's
decision that National Labor Board
decisions are binding on other gov
ernment agencies will have impor
tant bearing on the C.1.0.'s policy
toward Bethlehem Steel Corpora
tion. John L. Lewis, CIO president,
indicated tonight.
Here for a conference of the CIO
Steel Workers' Organizing Commit
tee, Lewis was hopeful that the un
ion may gain satisfactory action
wilhout resorting to a general strike
on its charges that Bethlehem is
"chiseling" on wages and working
<*>nditipns on government contracts.
The N.L.R.B. also has cited Beth
lehem for alleged unfair labor prac
tices.
