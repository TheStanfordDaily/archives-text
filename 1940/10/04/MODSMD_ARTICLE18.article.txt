### 
LONDON. Oct. 3 (UP).â€”The Brit
ish Fleet has carried out a four
day "sweep" of the eastern and
central Mediterranean in which Ital
ian warships, for the third time,
fled to cover and refused to engage
in battle, an Admiralty communi
que claimed tonight.
Intensification of the war in the
Mediterranean and Northern Af
rica, involving perhaps a combined
German-Italo drive across Egypt
toward the Suez Canal, was antici
pated in British quarters.
