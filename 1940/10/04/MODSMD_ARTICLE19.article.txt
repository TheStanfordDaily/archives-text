# Big Red Machine to Get First Conference Test Against Ducks Tomorrow
## Stenstrom, Berry to Lead Oregon Attack; Shaughnessy Plans Tight Defense, Strong Passing Offense 
### 
Tomorrow (hat startling, rejuvenated Stanford football team gets its
lir.st test under the fire of Coast Conference competition when it meets the
Wchfeet of Oregon for its lirst home game.
Stanford s dreams of a successful new football regime, founded on that
startling 27-0 victory over U.S.F. last Saturday, mav easilv he shat-

►tered. For tomorrow the Cards face
an alert, rugged, and hustling Ore
gon eleven as their first conference
opponent.
, Coached by the wily Tex Oliver,
one of the three prominently men
tioned candidates for Farm grid
coach last spring, the Webfoot score
was hardly as imposing as the In-

dians' in the opening tilt. They
turned back the San Diego Marines
12-2 on a slippery field but were
definitely under wraps during the
whole game.
Oliver's recent statement that he
has planned no particular defense to
stop the Indians' deceptive offense
and will send his team out on the
field to merely outscore the Cards
would lead people to expect a
strictly one-sided team from up
north invading the Stadium tomor
row.
But after all the object of this
game is to get more points than the
other fellow. And even without a
planned defense, that Oregon line
will be tough for Shaughnessy's men
to pierce. The line is compara
tively inexperienced but has all the
physical requirements necessary for
a good defense and was very ef
fective in keeping the Marines
bottled up last Saturday.
BOAST STAR TACKLE
Many experts claimed Jim Stuart,
Oregon tackle, the best man at this
position on the Coast last season.
He and : ".rris, a husky flank
man, are Vi.e outstanding veterans
in the Duck line.
The backfield that Oliver is plan
ning to have outscore Albert, Stand
lee and Co. has the experience to
go with their natural ability. The
halfbacks, Buck Berry, Len Isberg,
and Curley Mecham will do most of
the passing and running. Tough
Chet Haliski, at quarterback, will
clear their paths with his devastating
blocking and also handle the punting
assignments.
ANOTHER FULL DUEL
If Stanford's Norm Standlee was
disappointed with his rival Cliff
Fisk last Saturday in that so-called
"fullbacks' duel'' he may be a little
more satisfied tomorrow. His oppo
nent will be bruising Marshall
Stenstrom, who is supposed to pack
a terrific straight ahead wallop.
But what about that team which
will be well rounded in tomorrow's
conflict, which will have a defense
to stop its opponents' attack as well
as a precise, streamlined offense of
its own—that surprising Stanford
eleven.
Coach Clark Shaughnessy believes
| that he has stopped the Duck's at
! tack on paper, but it will be up to
; the linemen to bear him out in
action. Through information gath
ered from movies of last year's sorry
10-0 win by the Webfcet over Stan
ford and the reports of this year's
Oregon debut, Shaughnessy has de
vised a method to stop those potent
mouse trappers which Hali.ski's dev
tating blocks have made success
ful.
S' > I*l IS TO START
All the scouting that was done by
Oregon on the Cards in their open
ing .name may do little good. For
Hi; ughnessy's men used but one of
ihcir mastered formations, and both
the Oregon players and the Stanford
lai:s are going to see some more of
that "new" Shaughnessy stuff to
morrow.
Ore; I ,on is also going to see more
I hi'n I hey want of a few capable
<>ph<>::iore linemen. Again Sopho
ii.uivs Chuck Taylor and Dick Pal
iin I at guard, and Bruno Banducci
• I tackle as well as junior transfer
Vif Lindskog at center will play a
hi?' part in how the Indians go.
II their performance is anything
like their debut last Saturday,
Farm fans will have little to worry
about, Banducci, who is still wear
ing that harness to keep him from
rai ing his arm over his shoulder,
and Taylor stopped the touted Mr.
Fi;k time and time again and
rushed the Don passers to death,
throwing them for 10- and 12-yard
losses several times.
TAC KLES STRONG
Palmer and Lindskog were line
hacki i s in last Saturday's five-man
line defense. Both were alert to ihe
U.S.F. aerial thrusts and were con
. Umtly hustling up to the line to
help make stops.
Those Oregon mousetrappers
might make things tough on most
tackles but Banducci and Rod
W.rnecke can take care of them
selves. "Bruising Bruno" has a
charge last enough to put him in the
enemy hackfield almost with the
snap of the ball, while Warnecke
ha had the experience to help him
solve the mousetrappers.
With Shaughnessy having his
hackfield men tossing the football
all over the lot, it looks as though
the Card ends, Stan Graff and
Freddie Meyer, will have a busy
day snagging passes. Graff grabbed
a couple of beauties last Saturday
and Meyer proved himself in last
) oai s Big Game.
ILU KEIELD TOPS
A- lor that sweet hackfield, they
have everything. Sports writers had
said that the Indians kicking dev
partment would be weak this year
but Norm Standlee disproved this
by rooting out a couple over GO
yards against S.F. Stanford has
always been granted that its quar
terback Frank Albert had a good
pas ing arm, but it never looked
wceter than last Saturday and
Hankie's signal calling was letter
ported.
As for ball carrying, the Cards
1 a>. t speed and power in quantities.
Pile K :uet o vie, starting halfback,
and Eric Armstrong, second stringer,
are the "scooter" type. While the
experienced Hugh Gallarneau,
though not as tricky, can do some
mighty fast straight flying when
he wants to.
"Chief" Standlee is probably the
mo.' I powerful plunging fullback on
the Coast; and second stringers John
C. l ey at half and Milt Vucinich,
h. eking up Standlee, can do a little
crashing themselves.
On paper and on their perform
ing- against U.S.F. they look mighty
good. But after that first touchdown,
the Dons were a beaten club and no
14 1 1 test ol ability. The competition
tomoriow is going to be different.
1 he Cards will be playing in ihe
ii" league now and all will be
deadk serious. The odds of 2';> to 1
established in lavor of Stanford arc
absolutely foolish. Tomorrow's game
will be one of the most crucial on
the schedule; and if they can get
o\-( ;• as tough a conference opener
as Oregon, the Indians will be well
on their way.

TAC KLES STRONG
Palmer and Lindskog were line
hacki i s in last Saturday's five-man
line defense. Both were alert to ihe
U.S.F. aerial thrusts and were con
. Umtly hustling up to the line to
help make stops.
Those Oregon mousetrappers
might make things tough on most
tackles but Banducci and Rod
W.rnecke can take care of them
selves. "Bruising Bruno" has a
charge last enough to put him in the
enemy hackfield almost with the
snap of the ball, while Warnecke
ha had the experience to help him
solve the mousetrappers.
With Shaughnessy having his
hackfield men tossing the football
all over the lot, it looks as though
the Card ends, Stan Graff and
Freddie Meyer, will have a busy
day snagging passes. Graff grabbed
a couple of beauties last Saturday
and Meyer proved himself in last
) oai s Big Game.
ILU KEIELD TOPS
A- lor that sweet hackfield, they
have everything. Sports writers had
said that the Indians kicking dev
partment would be weak this year
but Norm Standlee disproved this
by rooting out a couple over GO
yards against S.F. Stanford has
always been granted that its quar
terback Frank Albert had a good
pas ing arm, but it never looked
wceter than last Saturday and
Hankie's signal calling was letter
ported.
As for ball carrying, the Cards
1 a>. t speed and power in quantities.
Pile K :uet o vie, starting halfback,
and Eric Armstrong, second stringer,
are the "scooter" type. While the
experienced Hugh Gallarneau,
though not as tricky, can do some
mighty fast straight flying when
he wants to.
"Chief" Standlee is probably the
mo.' I powerful plunging fullback on
the Coast; and second stringers John
C. l ey at half and Milt Vucinich,
h. eking up Standlee, can do a little
crashing themselves.
On paper and on their perform
ing- against U.S.F. they look mighty
good. But after that first touchdown,
the Dons were a beaten club and no
14 1 1 test ol ability. The competition
tomoriow is going to be different.
1 he Cards will be playing in ihe
ii" league now and all will be
deadk serious. The odds of 2';> to 1
established in lavor of Stanford arc
absolutely foolish. Tomorrow's game
will be one of the most crucial on
the schedule; and if they can get
o\-( ;• as tough a conference opener
as Oregon, the Indians will be well
on their way.
Tomorrow (hat startling, rejuvenated Stanford football team gets its
lir.st test under the fire of Coast Conference competition when it meets the
Wchfeet of Oregon for its lirst home game.
Stanford s dreams of a successful new football regime, founded on that
startling 27-0 victory over U.S.F. last Saturday, mav easilv he shat-

►tered. For tomorrow the Cards face
an alert, rugged, and hustling Ore
gon eleven as their first conference
opponent.
, Coached by the wily Tex Oliver,
one of the three prominently men
tioned candidates for Farm grid
coach last spring, the Webfoot score
was hardly as imposing as the In-

dians' in the opening tilt. They
turned back the San Diego Marines
12-2 on a slippery field but were
definitely under wraps during the
whole game.
Oliver's recent statement that he
has planned no particular defense to
stop the Indians' deceptive offense
and will send his team out on the
field to merely outscore the Cards
would lead people to expect a
strictly one-sided team from up
north invading the Stadium tomor
row.
But after all the object of this
game is to get more points than the
other fellow. And even without a
planned defense, that Oregon line
will be tough for Shaughnessy's men
to pierce. The line is compara
tively inexperienced but has all the
physical requirements necessary for
a good defense and was very ef
fective in keeping the Marines
bottled up last Saturday.
BOAST STAR TACKLE
Many experts claimed Jim Stuart,
Oregon tackle, the best man at this
position on the Coast last season.
He and : ".rris, a husky flank
man, are Vi.e outstanding veterans
in the Duck line.
The backfield that Oliver is plan
ning to have outscore Albert, Stand
lee and Co. has the experience to
go with their natural ability. The
halfbacks, Buck Berry, Len Isberg,
and Curley Mecham will do most of
the passing and running. Tough
Chet Haliski, at quarterback, will
clear their paths with his devastating
blocking and also handle the punting
assignments.
ANOTHER FULL DUEL
If Stanford's Norm Standlee was
disappointed with his rival Cliff
Fisk last Saturday in that so-called
"fullbacks' duel'' he may be a little
more satisfied tomorrow. His oppo
nent will be bruising Marshall
Stenstrom, who is supposed to pack
a terrific straight ahead wallop.
But what about that team which
will be well rounded in tomorrow's
conflict, which will have a defense
to stop its opponents' attack as well
as a precise, streamlined offense of
its own—that surprising Stanford
eleven.
Coach Clark Shaughnessy believes
| that he has stopped the Duck's at
! tack on paper, but it will be up to
; the linemen to bear him out in
action. Through information gath
ered from movies of last year's sorry
10-0 win by the Webfcet over Stan
ford and the reports of this year's
Oregon debut, Shaughnessy has de
vised a method to stop those potent
mouse trappers which Hali.ski's dev
tating blocks have made success
ful.

one of the three prominently men
tioned candidates for Farm grid
coach last spring, the Webfoot score
was hardly as imposing as the In-

dians' in the opening tilt. They
turned back the San Diego Marines
12-2 on a slippery field but were
definitely under wraps during the
whole game.
Oliver's recent statement that he
has planned no particular defense to
stop the Indians' deceptive offense
and will send his team out on the
field to merely outscore the Cards
would lead people to expect a
strictly one-sided team from up
north invading the Stadium tomor
row.
But after all the object of this
game is to get more points than the
other fellow. And even without a
planned defense, that Oregon line
will be tough for Shaughnessy's men
to pierce. The line is compara
tively inexperienced but has all the
physical requirements necessary for
a good defense and was very ef
fective in keeping the Marines
bottled up last Saturday.
BOAST STAR TACKLE
Many experts claimed Jim Stuart,
Oregon tackle, the best man at this
position on the Coast last season.
He and : ".rris, a husky flank
man, are Vi.e outstanding veterans
in the Duck line.
The backfield that Oliver is plan
ning to have outscore Albert, Stand
lee and Co. has the experience to
go with their natural ability. The
halfbacks, Buck Berry, Len Isberg,
and Curley Mecham will do most of
the passing and running. Tough
Chet Haliski, at quarterback, will
clear their paths with his devastating
blocking and also handle the punting
assignments.
ANOTHER FULL DUEL
If Stanford's Norm Standlee was
disappointed with his rival Cliff
Fisk last Saturday in that so-called
"fullbacks' duel'' he may be a little
more satisfied tomorrow. His oppo
nent will be bruising Marshall
Stenstrom, who is supposed to pack
a terrific straight ahead wallop.
But what about that team which
will be well rounded in tomorrow's
conflict, which will have a defense
to stop its opponents' attack as well
as a precise, streamlined offense of
its own—that surprising Stanford
eleven.
Coach Clark Shaughnessy believes
| that he has stopped the Duck's at
! tack on paper, but it will be up to
; the linemen to bear him out in
action. Through information gath
ered from movies of last year's sorry
10-0 win by the Webfcet over Stan
ford and the reports of this year's
Oregon debut, Shaughnessy has de
vised a method to stop those potent
mouse trappers which Hali.ski's dev
tating blocks have made success
ful.
S' > I*l IS TO START
All the scouting that was done by
Oregon on the Cards in their open
ing .name may do little good. For
Hi; ughnessy's men used but one of
ihcir mastered formations, and both
the Oregon players and the Stanford
lai:s are going to see some more of
that "new" Shaughnessy stuff to
morrow.
Ore; I ,on is also going to see more
I hi'n I hey want of a few capable
<>ph<>::iore linemen. Again Sopho
ii.uivs Chuck Taylor and Dick Pal
iin I at guard, and Bruno Banducci
• I tackle as well as junior transfer
Vif Lindskog at center will play a
hi?' part in how the Indians go.
II their performance is anything
like their debut last Saturday,
Farm fans will have little to worry
about, Banducci, who is still wear
ing that harness to keep him from
rai ing his arm over his shoulder,
and Taylor stopped the touted Mr.
Fi;k time and time again and
rushed the Don passers to death,
throwing them for 10- and 12-yard
losses several times.
TAC KLES STRONG
Palmer and Lindskog were line
hacki i s in last Saturday's five-man
line defense. Both were alert to ihe
U.S.F. aerial thrusts and were con
. Umtly hustling up to the line to
help make stops.
Those Oregon mousetrappers
might make things tough on most
tackles but Banducci and Rod
W.rnecke can take care of them
selves. "Bruising Bruno" has a
charge last enough to put him in the
enemy hackfield almost with the
snap of the ball, while Warnecke
ha had the experience to help him
solve the mousetrappers.
With Shaughnessy having his
hackfield men tossing the football
all over the lot, it looks as though
the Card ends, Stan Graff and
Freddie Meyer, will have a busy
day snagging passes. Graff grabbed
a couple of beauties last Saturday
and Meyer proved himself in last
) oai s Big Game.
ILU KEIELD TOPS
A- lor that sweet hackfield, they
have everything. Sports writers had
said that the Indians kicking dev
partment would be weak this year
but Norm Standlee disproved this
by rooting out a couple over GO
yards against S.F. Stanford has
always been granted that its quar
terback Frank Albert had a good
pas ing arm, but it never looked
wceter than last Saturday and
Hankie's signal calling was letter
ported.
As for ball carrying, the Cards
1 a>. t speed and power in quantities.
Pile K :uet o vie, starting halfback,
and Eric Armstrong, second stringer,
are the "scooter" type. While the
experienced Hugh Gallarneau,
though not as tricky, can do some
mighty fast straight flying when
he wants to.
"Chief" Standlee is probably the
mo.' I powerful plunging fullback on
the Coast; and second stringers John
C. l ey at half and Milt Vucinich,
h. eking up Standlee, can do a little
crashing themselves.
On paper and on their perform
ing- against U.S.F. they look mighty
good. But after that first touchdown,
the Dons were a beaten club and no
14 1 1 test ol ability. The competition
tomoriow is going to be different.
1 he Cards will be playing in ihe
ii" league now and all will be
deadk serious. The odds of 2';> to 1
established in lavor of Stanford arc
absolutely foolish. Tomorrow's game
will be one of the most crucial on
the schedule; and if they can get
o\-( ;• as tough a conference opener
as Oregon, the Indians will be well
on their way.
Tomorrow (hat startling, rejuvenated Stanford football team gets its
lir.st test under the fire of Coast Conference competition when it meets the
Wchfeet of Oregon for its lirst home game.
Stanford s dreams of a successful new football regime, founded on that
startling 27-0 victory over U.S.F. last Saturday, mav easilv he shat-

an alert, rugged, and hustling Ore

TAC KLES STRONG
Palmer and Lindskog were line
hacki i s in last Saturday's five-man
line defense. Both were alert to ihe
U.S.F. aerial thrusts and were con
. Umtly hustling up to the line to
help make stops.
Those Oregon mousetrappers
might make things tough on most
tackles but Banducci and Rod
W.rnecke can take care of them
selves. "Bruising Bruno" has a
charge last enough to put him in the
enemy hackfield almost with the
snap of the ball, while Warnecke
ha had the experience to help him
solve the mousetrappers.
With Shaughnessy having his
hackfield men tossing the football
all over the lot, it looks as though
the Card ends, Stan Graff and
Freddie Meyer, will have a busy
day snagging passes. Graff grabbed
a couple of beauties last Saturday
and Meyer proved himself in last
) oai s Big Game.
ILU KEIELD TOPS
A- lor that sweet hackfield, they
have everything. Sports writers had
said that the Indians kicking dev
partment would be weak this year
but Norm Standlee disproved this
by rooting out a couple over GO
yards against S.F. Stanford has
always been granted that its quar
terback Frank Albert had a good
pas ing arm, but it never looked
wceter than last Saturday and
Hankie's signal calling was letter
ported.
As for ball carrying, the Cards
1 a>. t speed and power in quantities.
Pile K :uet o vie, starting halfback,
and Eric Armstrong, second stringer,
are the "scooter" type. While the
experienced Hugh Gallarneau,
though not as tricky, can do some
mighty fast straight flying when
he wants to.
"Chief" Standlee is probably the
mo.' I powerful plunging fullback on
the Coast; and second stringers John
C. l ey at half and Milt Vucinich,
h. eking up Standlee, can do a little
crashing themselves.
On paper and on their perform
ing- against U.S.F. they look mighty
good. But after that first touchdown,
the Dons were a beaten club and no
14 1 1 test ol ability. The competition
tomoriow is going to be different.
1 he Cards will be playing in ihe
ii" league now and all will be
deadk serious. The odds of 2';> to 1
established in lavor of Stanford arc
absolutely foolish. Tomorrow's game
will be one of the most crucial on
the schedule; and if they can get
o\-( ;• as tough a conference opener
as Oregon, the Indians will be well
on their way.
Tomorrow (hat startling, rejuvenated Stanford football team gets its
lir.st test under the fire of Coast Conference competition when it meets the
Wchfeet of Oregon for its lirst home game.
Stanford s dreams of a successful new football regime, founded on that
startling 27-0 victory over U.S.F. last Saturday, mav easilv he shat-

►tered. For tomorrow the Cards face
an alert, rugged, and hustling Ore
gon eleven as their first conference
opponent.
, Coached by the wily Tex Oliver,
one of the three prominently men
tioned candidates for Farm grid
coach last spring, the Webfoot score
was hardly as imposing as the In-

dians' in the opening tilt. They
turned back the San Diego Marines
12-2 on a slippery field but were
definitely under wraps during the
whole game.
Oliver's recent statement that he
has planned no particular defense to
stop the Indians' deceptive offense
and will send his team out on the
field to merely outscore the Cards
would lead people to expect a
strictly one-sided team from up
north invading the Stadium tomor
row.
But after all the object of this
game is to get more points than the
other fellow. And even without a
planned defense, that Oregon line
will be tough for Shaughnessy's men
to pierce. The line is compara
tively inexperienced but has all the
physical requirements necessary for
a good defense and was very ef
fective in keeping the Marines
bottled up last Saturday.
BOAST STAR TACKLE
Many experts claimed Jim Stuart,
Oregon tackle, the best man at this
position on the Coast last season.
He and : ".rris, a husky flank
man, are Vi.e outstanding veterans
in the Duck line.
The backfield that Oliver is plan
ning to have outscore Albert, Stand
lee and Co. has the experience to
go with their natural ability. The
halfbacks, Buck Berry, Len Isberg,
and Curley Mecham will do most of
the passing and running. Tough
Chet Haliski, at quarterback, will
clear their paths with his devastating
blocking and also handle the punting
assignments.
ANOTHER FULL DUEL
If Stanford's Norm Standlee was
disappointed with his rival Cliff
Fisk last Saturday in that so-called
"fullbacks' duel'' he may be a little
more satisfied tomorrow. His oppo
nent will be bruising Marshall
Stenstrom, who is supposed to pack
a terrific straight ahead wallop.
But what about that team which
will be well rounded in tomorrow's
conflict, which will have a defense
to stop its opponents' attack as well
as a precise, streamlined offense of
its own—that surprising Stanford
eleven.
Coach Clark Shaughnessy believes
| that he has stopped the Duck's at
! tack on paper, but it will be up to
; the linemen to bear him out in
action. Through information gath
ered from movies of last year's sorry
10-0 win by the Webfcet over Stan
ford and the reports of this year's
Oregon debut, Shaughnessy has de
vised a method to stop those potent
mouse trappers which Hali.ski's dev
tating blocks have made success
ful.
S' > I*l IS TO START
All the scouting that was done by
Oregon on the Cards in their open
ing .name may do little good. For
Hi; ughnessy's men used but one of
ihcir mastered formations, and both
the Oregon players and the Stanford
lai:s are going to see some more of
that "new" Shaughnessy stuff to
morrow.
Ore; I ,on is also going to see more

<>ph<>::iore linemen. Again Sopho
ii.uivs Chuck Taylor and Dick Pal
iin I at guard, and Bruno Banducci
• I tackle as well as junior transfer
Vif Lindskog at center will play a
hi?' part in how the Indians go.
II their performance is anything
like their debut last Saturday,
Farm fans will have little to worry
about, Banducci, who is still wear
ing that harness to keep him from
rai ing his arm over his shoulder,
and Taylor stopped the touted Mr.
Fi;k time and time again and
rushed the Don passers to death,
throwing them for 10- and 12-yard
losses several times.
