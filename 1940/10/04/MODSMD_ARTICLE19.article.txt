# Big Red Machine to Get First Conference Test Against Ducks Tomorrow
## Stenstrom, Berry to Lead Oregon Attack; Shaughnessy Plans Tight Defense, Strong Passing Offense 
### 
Tomorrow (hat startling, rejuvenated Stanford football team gets its
lir.st test under the fire of Coast Conference competition when it meets the
Wchfeet of Oregon for its lirst home game.
Stanford s dreams of a successful new football regime, founded on that
startling 27-0 victory over U.S.F. last Saturday, mav easilv he shat-

►tered. For tomorrow the Cards face
an alert, rugged, and hustling Ore
gon eleven as their first conference
opponent.
, Coached by the wily Tex Oliver,
one of the three prominently men
tioned candidates for Farm grid
coach last spring, the Webfoot score
was hardly as imposing as the In-

dians' in the opening tilt. They
turned back the San Diego Marines
12-2 on a slippery field but were
definitely under wraps during the
whole game.
Oliver's recent statement that he
has planned no particular defense to
stop the Indians' deceptive offense
and will send his team out on the
field to merely outscore the Cards
would lead people to expect a
strictly one-sided team from up
north invading the Stadium tomor
row.
But after all the object of this
game is to get more points than the
other fellow. And even without a
planned defense, that Oregon line
will be tough for Shaughnessy's men
to pierce. The line is compara
tively inexperienced but has all the
physical requirements necessary for
a good defense and was very ef
fective in keeping the Marines
bottled up last Saturday.
BOAST STAR TACKLE
Many experts claimed Jim Stuart,
Oregon tackle, the best man at this
position on the Coast last season.
He and : ".rris, a husky flank
man, are Vi.e outstanding veterans
in the Duck line.
The backfield that Oliver is plan
ning to have outscore Albert, Stand
lee and Co. has the experience to
go with their natural ability. The
halfbacks, Buck Berry, Len Isberg,
and Curley Mecham will do most of
the passing and running. Tough
Chet Haliski, at quarterback, will
clear their paths with his devastating
blocking and also handle the punting
assignments.
ANOTHER FULL DUEL
If Stanford's Norm Standlee was
disappointed with his rival Cliff
Fisk last Saturday in that so-called
"fullbacks' duel'' he may be a little
more satisfied tomorrow. His oppo
nent will be bruising Marshall
Stenstrom, who is supposed to pack
a terrific straight ahead wallop.
But what about that team which
will be well rounded in tomorrow's
conflict, which will have a defense
to stop its opponents' attack as well
as a precise, streamlined offense of
its own—that surprising Stanford
eleven.
Coach Clark Shaughnessy believes
| that he has stopped the Duck's at
! tack on paper, but it will be up to
; the linemen to bear him out in
action. Through information gath
ered from movies of last year's sorry
10-0 win by the Webfcet over Stan
ford and the reports of this year's
Oregon debut, Shaughnessy has de
vised a method to stop those potent
