ABOARD WALLACE SPECIAL
EN ROUTE TO JAMESTOWN.
N.D., Oct. 3 (UP).—The New Deal
prevented a "very probable" revo
lution in the United States during
the 1932-33 depression," Henry A.
Wallace said tonight in a vigorous
defense of government spending.
The Democratic vice-presidential
nominee told a Butte, Mont., au
dience that New Deal spending sup
ported private capital in depres
sion years.
'"Private capital was scared stiff
during the '20's by economic condi
tion § and it continued to be scared
when the dictators began to rise to
power," Wallace said.
"We had to do what we did. If
we had not, there was serious dan
ger of a revolution in this country.
Even had there been no revolution,
a great many lives might have been
lost.
"With reasonable allowance for
human, mistakes, there has been
more sound value protected or cre
ated by the present government
than any created by the speculative
orgies of the great stock market
boom."
