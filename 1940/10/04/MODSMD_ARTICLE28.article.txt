# 'She Stoops to Conquer To Feature High Comedy
## Goldsmith Play Combines Forceful Direction and Unusual Characters 
### AMIE REICHERT 
Under ordinary circumstances, it wouldn't take an awful lot dramati
cally and technically to make a success of Oliver Goldsmith's great com
edy "She Stoops to Conquer." which will piny tonight and tomorrow night
in Memorial Auditorium, at 8:15. The plot, characterizations, and dialogue
are in themselves sufficiently funny and fast-moving to provide a good
evening's entertainment. *

But, combine this with good act
ing, energetic directing, and artistic
staging, and you really have some
thing that comes pretty close to hit
ting the theatrical jackpot. To get
down to cases, all this is by way of
program notes to the Stanford Play
ers' version of "She Stoops."
The happy combination of Gold
smith, Strickland, Johansen, Bailey,
Cady, et al. has produced this grati
fying result. Though the play is defi
nitely Victorian drama, don't let
this scare you. It's not the least bit
stilted or stuffy, it has happily es
caped the aura of mustiness which
so frequently suffuses the literature
of the period.
All this has been remedied by
modernizing the dialogue to a cer
tain extent and speeding up the ac
tion. In fact, from the technical angle
the play is decidedly as professional
a piece of work as any amateurs
ever turned out. The perfection of
the sets and costumes, the effective
ness of the lighting, and the re
markable speed with which the
scenes are shifted—a revolving stage
is used which is timed to the nth
degree and works without a hitch—
all this almost makes you forget
that you are seeing Victorian drama.
CADY SFIINES
Bud Cady, making a colossal en
trance—he falls down a long flight
of stairs —comes as close to stealing
the show as Margery Bailey and
Ash Wilson will let him—which is
no cinch. Cady in the part of half
witted black sheep of the Hardcastle
family ogles and clowns his way
through five acts and turns in a darn
good performance. Margery Bailey
as the shrewish matriarch of the
family plays her part with a tre
mendous amount of gusto and vital
ity, and her characterization is one
of the most polished in the play.
Ash Wilson, as always, is excel
lent in the part of a would-be
country squire replete with purple
velvet knickers and a stupendous
platinum blond wig. Lome Stanley
and Dana Winters are swell in their
parts. In fact, there isn't a single
person who isn't good in the whole
production.
WELL STAGED
The costuming, under Helen
Green's supervision, is colorful, and
on the whole very well-executed.
But the most professional touch is
Waldemar Johansen's sets, which are
remarkably accurate replicas of an
old-fashioned house and ale tavern.
They are purposely subdued almost
to the point of being flat but they
achieve a perfect setting for the col

orful, often outlandish costumes
which characterized the period.
Sum all this up and you have what
promises to be a refreshing and
amusing bit of extremely well pro
duced drama. In short, "She Stoops
to Conquer" is a hit.

staging, and you really have some
thing that comes pretty close to hit
ting the theatrical jackpot. To get
down to cases, all this is by way of
program notes to the Stanford Play
ers' version of "She Stoops."
The happy combination of Gold
smith, Strickland, Johansen, Bailey,
Cady, et al. has produced this grati
fying result. Though the play is defi
nitely Victorian drama, don't let
this scare you. It's not the least bit
stilted or stuffy, it has happily es
caped the aura of mustiness which
so frequently suffuses the literature
of the period.
All this has been remedied by
modernizing the dialogue to a cer
tain extent and speeding up the ac
tion. In fact, from the technical angle
the play is decidedly as professional
a piece of work as any amateurs
ever turned out. The perfection of
the sets and costumes, the effective
ness of the lighting, and the re
markable speed with which the
scenes are shifted—a revolving stage
is used which is timed to the nth
degree and works without a hitch—
all this almost makes you forget
that you are seeing Victorian drama.
CADY SFIINES
Bud Cady, making a colossal en
trance—he falls down a long flight
of stairs —comes as close to stealing
the show as Margery Bailey and
Ash Wilson will let him—which is
no cinch. Cady in the part of half
witted black sheep of the Hardcastle
family ogles and clowns his way
through five acts and turns in a darn
good performance. Margery Bailey
as the shrewish matriarch of the
family plays her part with a tre
mendous amount of gusto and vital
ity, and her characterization is one
of the most polished in the play.
Ash Wilson, as always, is excel
lent in the part of a would-be
country squire replete with purple
velvet knickers and a stupendous
platinum blond wig. Lome Stanley
and Dana Winters are swell in their
parts. In fact, there isn't a single
person who isn't good in the whole
production.
WELL STAGED
The costuming, under Helen
Green's supervision, is colorful, and
on the whole very well-executed.
But the most professional touch is
Waldemar Johansen's sets, which are
remarkably accurate replicas of an
old-fashioned house and ale tavern.
They are purposely subdued almost
to the point of being flat but they
achieve a perfect setting for the col

orful, often outlandish costumes
which characterized the period.
Sum all this up and you have what
promises to be a refreshing and
amusing bit of extremely well pro
duced drama. In short, "She Stoops
to Conquer" is a hit.
Under ordinary circumstances, it wouldn't take an awful lot dramati
cally and technically to make a success of Oliver Goldsmith's great com
edy "She Stoops to Conquer." which will piny tonight and tomorrow night
in Memorial Auditorium, at 8:15. The plot, characterizations, and dialogue
are in themselves sufficiently funny and fast-moving to provide a good
evening's entertainment. *

But, combine this with good act
ing, energetic directing, and artistic
staging, and you really have some
thing that comes pretty close to hit
ting the theatrical jackpot. To get
down to cases, all this is by way of
program notes to the Stanford Play
