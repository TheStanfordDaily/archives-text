# Dictators Debate U.S. Attitude
## Hitler and Mussolini Worried by Military Problems in Confab 
### United Press 
Hitler and Mussolini meet today
(Friday) in their favorite schem
ing spot at Brenner Pass and the
Fascists in Rome are saying that
the rendezvous is vitally con
cerned with what they call the
United Slates' recent "hostile
acts."
If the conference follows the pat
tern of the dictators' maneuverings
of the past week it may be shown
to be a "scare - out - the - United
States" demonstration.
Of course the brothers-in-arms of
Rome and Berlin have some very
important military matters to talk
over such as (1) Britain's resistance
to Germany's pounding air siege by
day and night, (2) the apparent
abandonment of any Nazi plans for
an invasion of Britain this year, (3)
the stalemate of the past tv/o weeks
in Italy's Egyptian offensive toward
the Suez, and (4) indications that
the British Fleet still is master of
the Mediterranean.
LEADERS FEAR U.S.
But the inspired shouting of the
Nazi and Fascist press in the past
week since the signing of the Italo-
German-Japanese military alliance
appears to lend credence to a belief
that the dictators are fearful of
what the United States may do or
may not do.
If they hoped that Washington
would be intimidated by the triple
alliance with Japan they were dis
appointed. because the most imme
diate U.S. reaction to that diplo
matic stroke was a decision to speed
up aid to Britain.
The German high command has
tacitly admitted that it will take at
least winter-long pummeling to
break down Britain's resistance to
air attack and that invasion must be
delayed until next spring.
Meanwhile, American aid and
perhaps a crystallization of certain
trends of American opinion may
make Britain far stronger than she
is now.
HARD WINTER COMING
Added to this will be the price
of what may be another long, hard
winter in Europe imposing upon
Germany and Italy the enormous
task of feeding the Nazi-conquered
nations of Western Europe, never
self-sufficient and now blockaded
to the west.
Britain too will suffer this win
ter but perhaps to a lesser extent
because she still controls the At
lantic shipping lanes.
FACE PROBLEMS
Faced with these prospects of a
stronger Brilain and perhaps a
weakened European continent in
the spring of 1941, Hitler and Mus
solini must concentrate their efforts
along three lines:
I—To keep the United States out
of the war. Threats and a show of
armed superiority are the only
available means because U.S.-AxLs
relations are past the point of any
reconciliation.
2—Search for new allies, such as
Japan, whom Hitler and Mussolini
count upon to restrain the United
States from extensively aiding or
fighting on the side of Britain.
3—Shift the theater of war away
from the British Isles — although
still maintaining winter-long Nazi
aerial assaults—to keep on wearing
down Britain's strength.
AFRICA CONSIDERED
Thus, it seems apparent that a
winter campaign of war in the Medi
terranean and North Africa may
be mapped by Hitler and Mussolini.
In fact, Rome reports Thursday
night told of Fascist claims that
Marshal Rodolfo Graziani's stalled
offensive has started rolling again
from Sidi Barrani toward Marsa
Matruh and the Suez Canal.
British military quarters have re
ported that the Germans have taken
over "de facto" command of the
Italian war machine, perhaps for an
intensification of the war in Africa,
and may be sending Nazi troops to
Italy.

ing spot at Brenner Pass and the
Fascists in Rome are saying that
the rendezvous is vitally con
cerned with what they call the
United Slates' recent "hostile
acts."
If the conference follows the pat
tern of the dictators' maneuverings
of the past week it may be shown
to be a "scare - out - the - United
States" demonstration.
Of course the brothers-in-arms of
Rome and Berlin have some very
important military matters to talk
over such as (1) Britain's resistance
to Germany's pounding air siege by
day and night, (2) the apparent
abandonment of any Nazi plans for
an invasion of Britain this year, (3)
the stalemate of the past tv/o weeks
in Italy's Egyptian offensive toward
the Suez, and (4) indications that
the British Fleet still is master of
the Mediterranean.
LEADERS FEAR U.S.
But the inspired shouting of the
Nazi and Fascist press in the past
week since the signing of the Italo-
German-Japanese military alliance
appears to lend credence to a belief
that the dictators are fearful of
what the United States may do or
may not do.
If they hoped that Washington
would be intimidated by the triple
alliance with Japan they were dis
appointed. because the most imme
diate U.S. reaction to that diplo
matic stroke was a decision to speed
up aid to Britain.
The German high command has
tacitly admitted that it will take at
least winter-long pummeling to
break down Britain's resistance to
air attack and that invasion must be
delayed until next spring.
Meanwhile, American aid and
perhaps a crystallization of certain
trends of American opinion may
make Britain far stronger than she
is now.
HARD WINTER COMING
Added to this will be the price
of what may be another long, hard
winter in Europe imposing upon
Germany and Italy the enormous
task of feeding the Nazi-conquered
nations of Western Europe, never
self-sufficient and now blockaded
to the west.
Britain too will suffer this win
ter but perhaps to a lesser extent
because she still controls the At
lantic shipping lanes.
FACE PROBLEMS
Faced with these prospects of a
stronger Brilain and perhaps a
weakened European continent in
the spring of 1941, Hitler and Mus
solini must concentrate their efforts
along three lines:
I—To keep the United States out
of the war. Threats and a show of
armed superiority are the only
available means because U.S.-AxLs
relations are past the point of any
reconciliation.
2—Search for new allies, such as
Japan, whom Hitler and Mussolini
count upon to restrain the United
States from extensively aiding or
fighting on the side of Britain.
3—Shift the theater of war away
from the British Isles — although
still maintaining winter-long Nazi
aerial assaults—to keep on wearing
down Britain's strength.
AFRICA CONSIDERED
Thus, it seems apparent that a
winter campaign of war in the Medi
terranean and North Africa may
be mapped by Hitler and Mussolini.
In fact, Rome reports Thursday
night told of Fascist claims that
Marshal Rodolfo Graziani's stalled
offensive has started rolling again
from Sidi Barrani toward Marsa
Matruh and the Suez Canal.
British military quarters have re
ported that the Germans have taken
over "de facto" command of the
Italian war machine, perhaps for an
intensification of the war in Africa,
and may be sending Nazi troops to
Italy.
