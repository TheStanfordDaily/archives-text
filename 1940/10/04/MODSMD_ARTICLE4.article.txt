torneys for Dewey Clark and Henry
Jones. Fresno negroes charged with
slaying Nathan Chinchiolo and
Dorothy Woofter, today obtained a
subpoena for the court appearance
of Ernest Striplin, Folsom prison
convict.
Slriplin confessed murdering
Chinchiolo and Miss Woofter sev

attorney's office said Striplin's con
fession was a hoax and quoted the
convict as saying he confessed so
he could "get out of Folsom for a
while."
