# Labor Party Takes Cabinet Posts as Chamberlain Resigns

### 
LONDON, Oct. :> (UP). —Demands for a more drastic shakeup of the
British government to provide "a real- instrument for winning the war"
were raised tonight as Neville Chamberlain passed into political retire
ment and Laborites took over a larger share of the war cabinet's posts.
Some sections of the press, expressing hopes that "this will not be the
last of the changes," called upon Prime Minister Winston Churchill to

bring venerable David Lloyd
George, Britain's World War pre
mier, into the government.
There also were complaints be
cause Viscount Halifax, closely as
sociated with the aged and ailing
Chamberlain in his "championship
of appeasement," had been retained
not only as Foreign Secretary but
as a member of the inner war cabi
net now increased from six to eight
members.
CHAMBERLAIN PASSES .
The passing of 71-year-old Cham
berlain, who brought Britain into
the war after struggling for "peace
in our time," saw a hard-boiled and
dynamic Laborite—Ernest Bevin—
assume the role of No. 2 man in
Britain's war cabinet.
Promotion of Bevin, a labor union
leader, to the war cabinet and his
retention of the all-important de
fense post of Minister of Labor
meant that the Labor party holds
three of eight posts in the Churchill
war cabinet.
WAR CABINET JOBS
Also elevated to the war cabinet
were Chancellor of the Exchequer
Sir Kingsley Wood and Sir John
Anderson, relieved of his post of
Home Secretary and Home Security
Minister to take over Chamberlain's
job as Lord President of the Coun
cil.
A movement to name Wood to
leadership of the Conservative party,
which. Chamberlain also resigned,
was said to have been crushed by
Churchill's consent to take the post.
The movement to name Wood was
cited as an effort to avoid identify
ing Churchill too closely with party
politics in this time of coalition war
effort.
HALIFAX NEXT?
Although he remained in the war
cabinet, many members of Parlia
ment believed that the next few
weeks may bring the resignation of
Lord Halifax, who has faced new
criticism because of the "appeasing"
of Japan on the Burma road ques
tion and the new Axis diplomatic
maneuverings.
In his reshuffle Churchill created
the new post of Minister for Works
and Buildings and First Commis
sioner of Works, shifting to the po
sition Sir John Reith from the
Ministry of Transport. The crea
tion of the new post was regarded
as evidence of the government's ef
forts to solve the plight of persons
left homeless by the German air
siege.

Latest statistics show that the av
erage length of life in Japan is 44
for males and 46 for females.
