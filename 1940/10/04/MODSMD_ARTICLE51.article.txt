# Reopening Seen Of Burma Road

### 
LONDON, Oct, 3 (UP). — Britain
has decided to reopen the Burma
, Road, main Chinese supply route, on
Oct. 17, after a thorough exchange
of views with Washington, it was
understood tonight.
The reported decision was consid
ered Britain's first answer to the new
German - Italian - Japanese alliance
and was believed by many to myk
the beginning of the end of a Brit
ish appeasement policy in the Far
East.
Prime Minister Winston Churchill's
first political gesture after today's
Cabinet changes was to receive at
No. 10 Downing Street Chinese Am
bassador Quo Tai-Chi. Officials on
both sides were reticent, but it was
believed the Prime Minister in
formed the ambassador of Britain's
intention to reopen the Burma
route to China—closed last July
under a three-months agreement
with Japan upon the latter's insist
ence.
It was further surmised that Quo
raised the question of British finan
cial and economic assistance to
China, in view of the recent United
States $25,000,000 loan to China.
The July agreement to close the
road, which expires October 17, was
reached with the understanding
that during the three months Japan
would seek peace with China. In
stead, Japan penetrated French
Indo-China to cut off Chinese
southern routes of supply and formed
a military alliance with Britain's
enemies.
