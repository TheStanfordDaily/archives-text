# Army Bill Gets Congress Okeh
## Senate, House Divide On Airport Measure 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 3 (UP). —
Congress today speedily approved
and sent to President Roosevelt
legislation carrying funds to finance
a Conscript-National Guard Army
of 1,024,441 men during the next
fiscal year.
The Senate thwarted at least tem
porarily the New Deal's airport
building program by deleting from
the $199,000,000 Civil Functions De
ficiency Bill an $80,000,000 item in
tended to start work on a program
that contemplated construction of
4000 airports.
The House, which had approved
the airport item, promptly sent the
measure to conference, where the
controversial item may be reinstated.
The Civil Functions Bill carries
civil agcncies appropriations chiefly
for national defense. It includes a
grant of approximately $62,500,000 to
the National Youth Administration
and the Office of Education for
training the nation's youth in skills
essential to the rearmament drive.
Opposition to the airport item was
led by Sen. Alva B. Adams, D„
Colo., who said it was presented to
Congress "without any type of con
tinuing plan for our aviation facili
ties." Adams said Congress had
been "put on the spot" by premature
publication of the Civil Aeronautics
Authority's plans for location of the
4000 airports.
