LONDON, Oct. 3 (UP).—British
aircraft experts are on the alert for
clues to new-type German war-*
planes which the Luftwaffe is ex
pected to hurl against Britain next
spring in a new, intensified prelude
to an attempted invasion.
Reich Marshal Hermann W. Goer
ing's air force, it is felt here, must
be developing new planes to replace
those which thus far have failed to
knock the RAF out of the skies and
make an invasion possible.
The Nazis presumably will try ex
tensive tests under actual combat
conditions for their new models
before fixing a final design.
