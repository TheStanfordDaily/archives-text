# Nazi Bombers Bless London With Easiest Raid in Months
## 
### 
LONDON, l< riday, Oct. 1 (UP). —The German Air Force appeared to
day to have given bomb-weary London its easiest night in almost a month.
The all-clear this morning came much earlier than usual. Night after
night the raiders have persisted until dawn sent them back across the
Channel.
Shortly after midnight the lethargic raid warmed up for a short time.

Then another lull fell over central,
London and persisted until the all
clear.
Six children aged about 7 were
killed when a bomb shattered a
classroom Thursday in the first raid
of the war on a Midland town. A
lone raider dropped a row of high
explosive and incendiary bombs
across the town.
Solitary German bombers made
sporadic thrusts at the metropolitan
area, but their attacks were more
like the "nuisance" raids of weeks
ago than the blitzkrieg which began
on Sept. 7. Furious anti-aircraft fire
in the outskirts of London repulsed
most of them.
The late night alarm, the fifth
since dawn Thursday, was followed
by a short, sharp anti-aircraft bar
rage and then a prolonged lull.
The fourth alarm sounded at dusk,
touching off an intense barrage by

the anti-aircraft batteries ringing
the capital. The alarm was brief,
giving way to the all-clear for one
of London's few breathing spells in
the early evening since the all-out
aerial siege began.
The murky sky was both a pro
tective blanket for the city and an
obstacle to counter-assaults on the
raiders.
A communique of the Air and
Home Security ministries said ear
lier that they dropped bombs on a
number of London boroughs, along
the Thames.River valley, and in
Essex, Kent, Cornwall and the Mid
lands.
