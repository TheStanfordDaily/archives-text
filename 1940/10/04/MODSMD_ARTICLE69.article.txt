hama County said the wounded
man would be returned tc/Red Bluff
as soon as possible and murder
charges will be filed against him.
Engle, with Sheriff W. Sublette
of Shasta County and three depu
ties, surrounded Leninger this
morning at an auto camp north of

he was staying.
When Leninger refused a demand
that he surrender, tear gas bombs
were thrown through the windows.
Engle said the man jumped from a
window and started to run and the
officers fired four shots, hitting him
in the thigh and elbow.
