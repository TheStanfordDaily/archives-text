# Frosh Open Season With San Mateo
## Shipkeymen Plan Heavy Sky Attack 
### DON SELBY 
Knowing lull well that they
face one of the toughest junior
college teams in northern Cali
fornia, Stanford's 1940 freshman
football team will trot onto the
turf in the Stadium tomorrow at
12 o'clock to play San Mateo Jun
ior College in the first game of the
season for both teams.
Although as yet they boast no
such outstanding and spectacular
backs as Frankie Albeit of the 1938
frosh or AI Cole of the 1939 year
lint* outfit, this year's team appears
to have a well balanced first outfit
that should be able to make a good
showing against the best it will meet
this year.
MITCHELL CHIEF CARRIER
When tomorrow's game comes to
an end Frosh Mentor Harry Shipkey
will have a much better idea whether
< r not he has another top-notch
lootball team. And from advance
notices, San Mateo is a good eleven
to make (he test.
Carrying the burden as the chief
ball carrier and passer for the
Papoose team will be well-built Bob
Mitchell, who has been given the
call for the starting left half berth
over Frank Forbes, a small but
speedy ball carrier.
Although the frosh can shift either
to the left or to the right in the
Shaughnessy single wing that they
are employing, the chances are that
they will shift right more often,
which means that Mitchell will be in
the tailback spot most of the time.
FAWCETT AT FULL
For the punch down the middle,
Shipkey has installed Randall
"Buck" Fawcett at fullback. In prac
tice this fall Fawcett has shown
himself to be a powerful runner
who is hard to bring down.
Tn the line the frosh eleven pre
sents what should prove to be a
good first line of defense. Jean La
moure, tackle, Bill Josslyn, guard,
and Loren LaPrade, center, are
probably the best known of the
seven huskies who man the forward
wall. However, that does not mean
that the other linemen are not every
hit as able to handle their positions.
MANY BULLDOG VETS
From San Mateo Coach Murius
McFadden will bring a victory
hungry team which is made up most
ly of veterans from last season's
very successful Bulldog squad. The
junior college eleven, which oper
ates from short punt and single wing
back formations, reportedly has had
quite a bit of success with the legal
screen pass â€” a play which Shipkey
has coached his team to defend
against.
Yesterday's drill saw the frosh
gridders concentrating on running
their plays against five and seven
man lines so that they won't be
fooled should the Bulldogs switch
defenses on them.
Only a light workout is planned
for tonight with defense as the fea
ture of the practice session. Place
kick and kickoff formations will also
receive attention.
ELLIS, BRUBAKER AT ENDS
Coach Shipkey plans to start Jim
Ellis and Bill Brubaker at ends, La
moure and Dick Abrams at tackles,
Kelly Ross and Josslyn at guards,
LaPrade at center, John Kenwood
at quarterback, Mitchell and Bob
Koch at halves, and Fawcett at full
back.
Although he will not use the unit
system of substitution, Shipkey
plans to substitute freely. Almost
certain to see action are the fol
lowing: ends, Bill Nourse, Bud Mad
den, and Henry Hegge; tackles, Jim
Cox, Hal Petrich, and Jack Monte
verde; guards, Darwin Seeley and
Matt Petrlich; centers, Tyler Nor
ton. Frank Heid, and Bill Hutchin
son; quarterbacks, Jack Reynolds
and Keith Pinion; halfbacks, Frank
Forbes, Lee Scott, Jim Troup, and
Joe Mardesich; fullback Doyle
Coldiron.
