## 
### 
BERKELEY, Oct. 3 (UP).â€”The
fomewhat tattered Golden Bears of
the University of California ran
through a short signal practice to
day, but Coach Stub Allison still
was uncertain of his starting lineup
for the St. Mary's game Saturday.
The Bears will go through another
brief workout tomorrow. There
will be no contact work.
During the first year of Stanford
University approximately a fourth
of the students were women, three
fourths men.
