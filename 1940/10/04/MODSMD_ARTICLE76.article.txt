# Reds Square Series, 5-3, As Walters Hurls Three-Hitter
## 
### 
CINCINNATI. Oct. 3 (UP). —Come out of the storm cellars, National
Leaguers, and hold your heads high again, for a bow-legged ex-third base
man named William Henry Walters, Jr., this day turned the American
League powder magazine into a harmless heap of ashes as the Cincinnati
Reds battled their way to a 5-.*5 triumph over the Detroit Tigers and evened

the World Scries at one game each.<
With a happy, hilarious crowd of
I 30,640 persons banked around the
: Crosley Field stands, Walters ended
the long line of American League
World Series conquests with a cour
ageous 3-hit pitching performance.
It was the first National League vic
tory since October 9, 1937, snapping
the American League's victory
j string at ten straight.
Walters turned the Tiger bats into
I toothpicks today with the first 3-hit
World Series game any pitcher has
twirled since Wild Bill Hallahan,
Cardinal southpaw, did it against the
Athletics in the 1931 World Series.
WILSON CATCHES
Oddly enough, it was Jimmy Wil
| son, the 40-year-old coach filling in
| for the injured Ernie Lombardi, who
I caught Hallahan's 3-hitter nine years
| ago and duplicated it again today
| behind Walters.
While Walters was silencing the
' big bludgeons of the Tigers. School-
I boy Rowe, Detroit's ace who won 16
! games while losing only three during
; the American League season, fal
i tered under a slashing Cincinnati
! attack in the second, third and
fourth innings and retired under fire.
The Reds spotted the Tigers a 2-0
! lead and then ripped down their
j advantage with a sustained attack
i which finally shelled Rowe to cover.
; His successor, Rookie John Corsica,
i another right hander, stopped the
J Reds with one hit in the last 4 1-3
I innings but that was too late.
TIGERS LACK SPIRIT
I The Tigers were not the same con
! fident team that routed Paul Der
ringer and made the National
League champions look silly yester
day. It was a sad day all around
for the Tigers, who shared the grief
I of Buck Newsom over his father's
| death early this morning in a Cin

cinnati hotel. The elder Newsom,
who was 68, suffered a heart attack
as an aftermath of the excitement
following his son's victory in the
opening game.
The Reds used American League
tactics to break the 2-2 deadlock.
Ival Goodman beat out a swinging
bunt down to York, beating the first
baseman's throw to the bag. Then
with one out, Jimmy Ripple slashed
a line drive home run into the right
field bleachers at the 370-foot mark.

World Series game any pitcher has
twirled since Wild Bill Hallahan,
Cardinal southpaw, did it against the
Athletics in the 1931 World Series.
WILSON CATCHES
Oddly enough, it was Jimmy Wil
| son, the 40-year-old coach filling in
| for the injured Ernie Lombardi, who
I caught Hallahan's 3-hitter nine years
| ago and duplicated it again today
| behind Walters.
While Walters was silencing the
' big bludgeons of the Tigers. School-
I boy Rowe, Detroit's ace who won 16
! games while losing only three during
; the American League season, fal
i tered under a slashing Cincinnati
! attack in the second, third and
fourth innings and retired under fire.
The Reds spotted the Tigers a 2-0
! lead and then ripped down their
j advantage with a sustained attack
i which finally shelled Rowe to cover.
; His successor, Rookie John Corsica,
i another right hander, stopped the
J Reds with one hit in the last 4 1-3
I innings but that was too late.
TIGERS LACK SPIRIT
I The Tigers were not the same con
! fident team that routed Paul Der
ringer and made the National
League champions look silly yester
day. It was a sad day all around
for the Tigers, who shared the grief
I of Buck Newsom over his father's
| death early this morning in a Cin

cinnati hotel. The elder Newsom,
who was 68, suffered a heart attack
as an aftermath of the excitement
following his son's victory in the
opening game.
The Reds used American League
tactics to break the 2-2 deadlock.
Ival Goodman beat out a swinging
bunt down to York, beating the first
baseman's throw to the bag. Then
with one out, Jimmy Ripple slashed
a line drive home run into the right
field bleachers at the 370-foot mark.
CINCINNATI. Oct. 3 (UP). —Come out of the storm cellars, National
Leaguers, and hold your heads high again, for a bow-legged ex-third base
man named William Henry Walters, Jr., this day turned the American
League powder magazine into a harmless heap of ashes as the Cincinnati
Reds battled their way to a 5-.*5 triumph over the Detroit Tigers and evened

the World Scries at one game each.<
With a happy, hilarious crowd of
I 30,640 persons banked around the
: Crosley Field stands, Walters ended
the long line of American League
World Series conquests with a cour
ageous 3-hit pitching performance.
It was the first National League vic
tory since October 9, 1937, snapping
the American League's victory
j string at ten straight.
Walters turned the Tiger bats into
I toothpicks today with the first 3-hit
World Series game any pitcher has
