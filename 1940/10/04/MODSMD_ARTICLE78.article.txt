WATER SHOW PLANNED
In addition, an outstanding wa
-1 ter show has been planned for both
, nights, with diving exhibitions by
Marjorie Gestring and Howie Ad

Two games will be played Friday
night, with the winners meeting
Saturday night for the title, and
the losers will clash for the next
places. The first game will begin
at 7:30 o'clock both evenings.

this summer and, thus, cannot com
pete in this junior tournament.
Further evidence of Cal's prow

for over five weeks.

j tough team to beat, he predicts, and
i will be in there fighting every rvin
ute.

WATER SHOW PLANNED
In addition, an outstanding wa
-1 ter show has been planned for both
, nights, with diving exhibitions by
Marjorie Gestring and Howie Ad
ams, comedy diving, and a water
circus.
Two games will be played Friday
night, with the winners meeting
Saturday night for the title, and
the losers will clash for the next
places. The first game will begin
at 7:30 o'clock both evenings.
Handicapped by having practiced
for only a little more than a week
and with the team riddled by colds,
the Farm varsity goes into the tour
ney as underdog—a position appar
ently favorable to recent Card ath
letic squads.
BEARS PICKED AS TOPS
Cal has been tagged by Coach
Nort Thornton as the team to beat.
They played the Olympic Club re
cently and although the Bears lost
by one point, they are to be con
sidered the top team, for the Olym
pic varsity will be ineligible to
night. The Olympic varsity won on
the National A.A.U. championship
this summer and, thus, cannot com
pete in this junior tournament.
Further evidence of Cal's prow
ess is they have been practicing
for over five weeks.
But Coach Thornton is not dis
| heartened. The Cards will be a
j tough team to beat, he predicts, and
i will be in there fighting every rvin
ute.
