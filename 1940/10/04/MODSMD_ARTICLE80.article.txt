# Reds Take Win Right in Stride
## 
### 
CINCINNATI. Oct. 3 (UP).—
Yuu have to say one thing for the
Cincinnati Reds—they get used
to victory mighty quick.
Beaten in five straight World
Series games before today, they
accepted their 5 to 3 win over the |
Tigers as calmly as if it were an
everyday occurrence like parting
their hair, kissing their wives
goodbye, or cussing umpires.
Reporters visited their dressing
room after the first National League
series win since October of 1937 |
in (he hopes of seeing a scene com- j
bining the noisiest features of (1)
the fall of Jericho, (2) the Fourth I
of July in a boiler factory and (3) j
amateur night in the zoo. Thoy were j
badly disappointed.
From Manager Bill McKechnie j
right down to the locker boy in
charge of liniment and towels, the
Reds behaved with the dignity of !
an auctioneer at a church raffle, j
There never was a time, from the j
moment they trooped into the room !
off the field until they grabbed their
handbags and headed for the train
to Detroit, that they gave way to
boyish enthusiasm.
This unusual behavior was first
credited to the shock of finally
having beaten an American League
club in a series game, but conver
sation with them shattered this be
lief. The Reds all talked very ra
tionally, and the final impression !
one got was that the Reds consider j
themselves a great ball club, real |
champions, and that victory is only I
their due.
