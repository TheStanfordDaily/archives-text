# Improvement Seen in Indian Cross-Country Track Squad
## 
### 
What would have been one of the strongest cross-country teams in
Stanford history has been broken up.
Paul Moore is working for (lie telephone company down south. Mush
'Girai'd is enrolled at Cal. and Jack Moore has joined (lie Ainiy Air
Corps. Another fine distance man. Hurman Skrable. has failed to return

to the Farm. All these men would
have been eligible for the fall sport
although Girard and Paul Moore had
competed three years in track and
field.
Pitch Johnson, the Farm's new
coach, was dealt another severe
blow when little A1 Soldate decided
to concentrate on studies instead of
going out for the cross-country
grind.
After a week's workout, the team
is beginning to shape up fairly well.
Aub Seed, two-mile veteran last
spring, is probably number one man
at present with Jim Mitchell, up
from the frosh, and Bill Bostwick.
Johnson and the B.A.C. are work
ing on the schedule for the coming
season, trying to get some practice
meets in before the big affair with
perennially-strong Cah Last year
Stan Sadaj, Ted Vollmer & Co. ran
the Indians ragged with a powerful
bunch of distance men.
Every coed has one ambition, says
college writer: to go with every
Tom, Dick, and marry.
