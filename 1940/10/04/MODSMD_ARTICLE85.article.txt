NEW YOKK. Oct. 3 (UP).—Henry
Armstrong, defending his welter
weight championship for the 20th
time, is the 3-1 favorite to beat
Fritzie Zivic of Pittsburgh tomorrow
night at Madison Square Garden.
Experts generally agree that this
3-1 price i.s much too lop-sided for
two reasons: (1) Armstrong is no
longer the great warrior of 1937-38
when he won three titles in 10
months, and (2) he i.s tackling one
of the best all-round fighters he
ever met.
Zivic is a dangerous foe for Arm
strong because the Pittsburgh Croa
tian is a fast, smart, tough, seasoned
fighter. He is a hard puncher, and
right at his peak at 20 years. Thjs
will be Fritzie's 150 th professional
fight.
