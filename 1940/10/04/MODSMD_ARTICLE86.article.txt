### JERRY BRUCKER 
r j , EX OLIVER, who brings his
Ducks to the Stadium tomorrow
to meet the Big Red Machine, has
been spreading the old hooey pretty
thick since the Shaughnc.ssy debut in
last week.
Tiie Ore{ >on mentor is not given
to making speeches, being the strong,
silent type of coach who prefers to
let his football team do the talking
>n the gridiron. With this in mind
>ne can detect a pronounced odoi
•>f halibut in the remarks Oliver hat
been making to the press in the last
five days.
l|i the press box at Kezar a sports
writer, sitting conveniently nearby
ust happened to hear the Webfoot
master mind shout that the Indians
were 'better than U.S.C. last year."
It tithes a hit (it something to
watch a team in its first game un
der a new system and say that it
is better than the nation's third
ranking team the season before.
Tuesday word trickled down from
the practice field at Eugene that the
Oregon board of strategy had given
up trying to concoct a defense for
Stanford s '"l formation offense and
was working on its own attack.
Mebbeso, but it might be that the
northerners figured they already had
a defense t:> stop the Indian attack.
They had four men scouting ihe
Shaughnessy plays last Saturday, in
cluding Mike Mikulak, who played
against the similar system used by
the Chicago Bears in pro ball. It has
been rumored that Oregon also payed
two professional scouts a tidy sum
for information on the Big Red
Machine.
(live a football strategist like
Oliver this much information to
work with and he's not likely to
<|iti( until he has what he consid
ers an adequate defense. And if
there is a defense, Oliver is the
man to find it.
The Ducks may do a good deal of
■ground-gaining themselves tomor
row. Oregon can start a team with
nine lettermen and two promising
sophomores, as against the four
newcomers in Stanford's lineup.
Leading the attack will be Buck
Berry, ISO-pound helUfor-leather
halfback who has been groomed to
step into the spot vacated by Jay
Graybeal. Other baekfield stars are
Marshall Stenstrom, pile-driving
fullback, and Chet Haliski, senior
quarterback.
1 lie Wehfeet will en : oy a defi
nite weight advantage in the line,
but if their forward wall is no
smarter than the I'.S.F. linemen
were, it won't do them much good
against the hard charging Indians.
in spite of Oliver's psychology
campaign and the Oregon advantage
in the experience department, it
looks from here as though the In
dians may help themselves to a por
tion of Duck soup tomorrow.
'Ihe team will be more sure of it

self, i.s in top physical condition, and
has had a week to practice that
flashy offense. A lot of work on
fundamentals in the last week won't
do any harm, either.

Machine.
(live a football strategist like
Oliver this much information to
work with and he's not likely to
<|iti( until he has what he consid
ers an adequate defense. And if
there is a defense, Oliver is the
man to find it.
The Ducks may do a good deal of
■ground-gaining themselves tomor
row. Oregon can start a team with
nine lettermen and two promising
sophomores, as against the four
newcomers in Stanford's lineup.
Leading the attack will be Buck
Berry, ISO-pound helUfor-leather
halfback who has been groomed to
step into the spot vacated by Jay
Graybeal. Other baekfield stars are
Marshall Stenstrom, pile-driving
fullback, and Chet Haliski, senior
quarterback.
1 lie Wehfeet will en : oy a defi
nite weight advantage in the line,
but if their forward wall is no
smarter than the I'.S.F. linemen
were, it won't do them much good
against the hard charging Indians.
in spite of Oliver's psychology
campaign and the Oregon advantage
in the experience department, it
looks from here as though the In
dians may help themselves to a por
tion of Duck soup tomorrow.
'Ihe team will be more sure of it

self, i.s in top physical condition, and
has had a week to practice that
flashy offense. A lot of work on
fundamentals in the last week won't
do any harm, either.

I UCKY LOUIE'S selections got
pinched out of the paper last
week, so the great Canadian middle
man will start keeping score with
this list of selections. He guarantees
they're right off the griddle. If you
can do better, send your selections
on these games, enclosing a carton
of Old Golds, to Lucky Louie. Lo
