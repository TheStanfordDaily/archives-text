# A 						Reply to Rogers
## 
### 
In yesterday's Daily Bill Rogers criticized
the U.S. army system. Today, with full space
at his disposal, George Hislop replies to Rog
ers' statements. Neither editorial necessarily
reflects official Daily attitude.—The Editor.
THIS is supposed to be an answer to Bill
Rogers, son of the late Will Rogers. Young
Bill was a Stanford graduate and a member of
the Stanford R.O.T.C. unit, but above all he was
a polo player. He had "A's" in polo. The Uni
versity regulations state that in order to play
polo, the individual must be enrolled in R.O.T.C.
training. Thus it is with this background of
"A's" in polo and "D's" in most of his other
military courses that young Bill states, "We have
had some experience with the U.S. army, and,
frankly, we don't think very much of the U.S.
army system." This is not an attempt to blacken
the name of "young" Bill Rogers at all, but it is
an attempt to show the unsound background
upon which he is basing his arguments.
He puts in the claim that "it is more than
old-fashioned; it is fossilized." If he means that
we still have generals who give their orders to
colonels, who in turn pass them along to majors,
who shout them to captains, who bluster them
to the shave-tails, yes, the army is old-fashionad;
but, then, so is every other army in the world
today. Even Goering is a marshal and carries
his baton wherever he struts.
But, perhaps he means that every second lieu
tenant who comes into the army should imme
diately, be given an opportunity to try his one
brain-within-a-brain child.
The army is slow at times. It feels its way
along testing this rifle, that tank or machine gun,
to see if it will stand the pressure on the field
of battle or whether, instead, the rifle will be
come so hot the barrel warps and the soldier
will be left to fight the enemy with his bare fists
at 200 yards.
"Young" Bill is quite right in saying that a
person doesn't mind doing his share so much
when he is able to see the results; but an officer
with the training that was offered Rogers should,
with a small amount of effort, be far-sighted
enough to put the jigsaw puzzle of infantry,
artillery, coast guard, anti cavalry together and
see the results.
"Young" Bill's lament about the use of cavalry
and horse-drawn artillery instead of the new mo
torized units is colored for his use and without
fact to back it up.
Over half of the German artillery is still horse
drawn, and the German army has over three
quarters of a million horses in use today—this
does not include those in the supply columns.
The use and importance of the horse-drawn ar
tillery is vastly underrated. It takes over six
months of intensive training and maneuver to
properly prepare a battery for active service,
to teach the men horsemanship, teach them the
care of horses so that they will be able to pull
the heavy cannon day in and day out. YET
practically every man on the campus can step
into an automobile and drive it. Once a man
has been trained in a horse-drawn outfit, it re
quires only a week or so to turn him into a well
trained motorized man.
To dwell upon the exaggerated facts in his
description of the over-night march would be
ridiculous. He called the trip a "dream world,"
a "make-believe" one without even a single en
emy behind a bush. Well, perhaps, if there had
been an enemy behind every bush and he had
been fighting for his life he wouldn't be thinking
about a Good Humor Man (but the ice-cream
company was probably glad of the free adver
tising even if it was without the bell).
The real basis of his criticism can be found,
I think, in the fact that "young" Bill was the
"fun-loving Rover" and was rather irked at the
soft, comfortable cars whizzing past while HE
had to drive a horse, which is work.
He completely lost sight of the purpose of the
trip. Instead of taking it for what it was, a prac
tice march with full equipment so that if he
ever had to go to war he would at least once
in his life have gone through the "signal prac
tice" of setting up camp in the dark, locating an
enemy, even if only imaginary, figuring data to
shoot at him, and pulling out of position before
he was blown out. But he was the "fun loving
Rover" and probably took his fun with him.
There are some reasons for our lack of mech

anization and they are dollars. The ones which
Congress failed to appropriate at the end of the
first World War. With the money that the army
had, it held experiments to determine the mod
els that would go into production when the
funds did come.
The U.S. army has modern tanks, guns,
trucks, and rolling hospitals. And whether or
not the equipment we use is the newest, the
process to be applied is the same; the methods
are the same. One deosn't give a beginning
horseman a thoroughbred to learn on.
To say that the "R.O.T.C. is nothing but a
glorified fraternity and most of its 'young offi
cers' will probably turn out to be draft dodgers,"
is rather an immature calumny and very unjust,
but then in this case he may know whereof he
speaks, as he is an R.O.T.C. officer.
"Young" Bill wants to be taught to "fix a motor
car," and "operate a portable radio" and such
things. If that is the case he should not have
come to Stanford and taken an officer's train
ing, but gone to a trade school and become'an
enlisted man.
"Young" Bill states that "the only time we
ever saw any pep or energy around the R.O.T.C.
was preparing for the annual 'officers' ball'."
With statements like this along with the others
in this editorial, it seems "young" Bill has taken
this opportunity to describe his own feelings
and experiences in R.O.T.C. training.
It is the pleasure and freedom of a man to
take a crack at West Point if he feels the urge,
but to say that a West Point officer has the
"worst head for figures" sounds rather odd
when the great majority of people know that
it has higher math requirements than almost
'any other school and that its undergraduate
-curriculum is engineering. As far as the "best
polished shoes in the business" goes, I like well
polished shoes. I think they look better than
dirty ones, and the polish is certainly good for
the shoes.
• Our army is sound; its principles are sound
in spite of the grandstand quarterbacks who,
according to the grandstand quarterbacks, know
best. "Young" Bill's rhetoric was excellent, how
ever, and his effort well written, doing his re
vered and loved father justice; but it was not
so humorous as it was ludicrous.—George His
lop.

He completely lost sight of the purpose of the
trip. Instead of taking it for what it was, a prac
tice march with full equipment so that if he
ever had to go to war he would at least once
in his life have gone through the "signal prac
tice" of setting up camp in the dark, locating an
enemy, even if only imaginary, figuring data to
shoot at him, and pulling out of position before
he was blown out. But he was the "fun loving
Rover" and probably took his fun with him.
There are some reasons for our lack of mech

anization and they are dollars. The ones which
Congress failed to appropriate at the end of the
first World War. With the money that the army
had, it held experiments to determine the mod
els that would go into production when the
funds did come.
The U.S. army has modern tanks, guns,
trucks, and rolling hospitals. And whether or
not the equipment we use is the newest, the
process to be applied is the same; the methods
are the same. One deosn't give a beginning
horseman a thoroughbred to learn on.
To say that the "R.O.T.C. is nothing but a
glorified fraternity and most of its 'young offi
cers' will probably turn out to be draft dodgers,"
is rather an immature calumny and very unjust,
but then in this case he may know whereof he
speaks, as he is an R.O.T.C. officer.
"Young" Bill wants to be taught to "fix a motor
car," and "operate a portable radio" and such
things. If that is the case he should not have
come to Stanford and taken an officer's train
ing, but gone to a trade school and become'an
enlisted man.
"Young" Bill states that "the only time we
ever saw any pep or energy around the R.O.T.C.
was preparing for the annual 'officers' ball'."
With statements like this along with the others
in this editorial, it seems "young" Bill has taken
this opportunity to describe his own feelings
and experiences in R.O.T.C. training.
It is the pleasure and freedom of a man to
take a crack at West Point if he feels the urge,
but to say that a West Point officer has the
"worst head for figures" sounds rather odd
when the great majority of people know that
it has higher math requirements than almost
'any other school and that its undergraduate
-curriculum is engineering. As far as the "best
polished shoes in the business" goes, I like well
polished shoes. I think they look better than
dirty ones, and the polish is certainly good for
the shoes.
• Our army is sound; its principles are sound
in spite of the grandstand quarterbacks who,
according to the grandstand quarterbacks, know
best. "Young" Bill's rhetoric was excellent, how
ever, and his effort well written, doing his re
vered and loved father justice; but it was not
so humorous as it was ludicrous.—George His
lop.
In yesterday's Daily Bill Rogers criticized
the U.S. army system. Today, with full space
at his disposal, George Hislop replies to Rog
ers' statements. Neither editorial necessarily
reflects official Daily attitude.—The Editor.
THIS is supposed to be an answer to Bill
Rogers, son of the late Will Rogers. Young
Bill was a Stanford graduate and a member of
the Stanford R.O.T.C. unit, but above all he was
a polo player. He had "A's" in polo. The Uni
versity regulations state that in order to play
polo, the individual must be enrolled in R.O.T.C.
training. Thus it is with this background of
"A's" in polo and "D's" in most of his other
military courses that young Bill states, "We have
had some experience with the U.S. army, and,
frankly, we don't think very much of the U.S.
army system." This is not an attempt to blacken
the name of "young" Bill Rogers at all, but it is
an attempt to show the unsound background
upon which he is basing his arguments.
He puts in the claim that "it is more than
old-fashioned; it is fossilized." If he means that
we still have generals who give their orders to
colonels, who in turn pass them along to majors,
who shout them to captains, who bluster them
to the shave-tails, yes, the army is old-fashionad;
but, then, so is every other army in the world
today. Even Goering is a marshal and carries
his baton wherever he struts.
But, perhaps he means that every second lieu
tenant who comes into the army should imme
diately, be given an opportunity to try his one
brain-within-a-brain child.
The army is slow at times. It feels its way
along testing this rifle, that tank or machine gun,
to see if it will stand the pressure on the field
of battle or whether, instead, the rifle will be
come so hot the barrel warps and the soldier
will be left to fight the enemy with his bare fists
at 200 yards.
"Young" Bill is quite right in saying that a
person doesn't mind doing his share so much
when he is able to see the results; but an officer
with the training that was offered Rogers should,
with a small amount of effort, be far-sighted
enough to put the jigsaw puzzle of infantry,
artillery, coast guard, anti cavalry together and
see the results.
"Young" Bill's lament about the use of cavalry
and horse-drawn artillery instead of the new mo
torized units is colored for his use and without
fact to back it up.
Over half of the German artillery is still horse
drawn, and the German army has over three
quarters of a million horses in use today—this
does not include those in the supply columns.
The use and importance of the horse-drawn ar
tillery is vastly underrated. It takes over six
months of intensive training and maneuver to
properly prepare a battery for active service,
to teach the men horsemanship, teach them the
care of horses so that they will be able to pull
the heavy cannon day in and day out. YET
practically every man on the campus can step
into an automobile and drive it. Once a man
has been trained in a horse-drawn outfit, it re
quires only a week or so to turn him into a well
trained motorized man.
To dwell upon the exaggerated facts in his
description of the over-night march would be
ridiculous. He called the trip a "dream world,"
a "make-believe" one without even a single en
emy behind a bush. Well, perhaps, if there had
been an enemy behind every bush and he had
been fighting for his life he wouldn't be thinking
about a Good Humor Man (but the ice-cream
company was probably glad of the free adver
tising even if it was without the bell).
The real basis of his criticism can be found,
I think, in the fact that "young" Bill was the
"fun-loving Rover" and was rather irked at the
soft, comfortable cars whizzing past while HE
had to drive a horse, which is work.
He completely lost sight of the purpose of the

He puts in the claim that "it is more than
old-fashioned; it is fossilized." If he means that
we still have generals who give their orders to
colonels, who in turn pass them along to majors,
who shout them to captains, who bluster them
to the shave-tails, yes, the army is old-fashionad;
but, then, so is every other army in the world
today. Even Goering is a marshal and carries
his baton wherever he struts.
But, perhaps he means that every second lieu
tenant who comes into the army should imme
diately, be given an opportunity to try his one
brain-within-a-brain child.
The army is slow at times. It feels its way
along testing this rifle, that tank or machine gun,
to see if it will stand the pressure on the field
of battle or whether, instead, the rifle will be
come so hot the barrel warps and the soldier
will be left to fight the enemy with his bare fists
at 200 yards.
"Young" Bill is quite right in saying that a
person doesn't mind doing his share so much
when he is able to see the results; but an officer
with the training that was offered Rogers should,
with a small amount of effort, be far-sighted
enough to put the jigsaw puzzle of infantry,
artillery, coast guard, anti cavalry together and
see the results.
"Young" Bill's lament about the use of cavalry
and horse-drawn artillery instead of the new mo
torized units is colored for his use and without
fact to back it up.
Over half of the German artillery is still horse
drawn, and the German army has over three
quarters of a million horses in use today—this
does not include those in the supply columns.
The use and importance of the horse-drawn ar
tillery is vastly underrated. It takes over six
months of intensive training and maneuver to
properly prepare a battery for active service,
to teach the men horsemanship, teach them the
care of horses so that they will be able to pull
the heavy cannon day in and day out. YET
practically every man on the campus can step
into an automobile and drive it. Once a man
has been trained in a horse-drawn outfit, it re
quires only a week or so to turn him into a well
trained motorized man.
To dwell upon the exaggerated facts in his
description of the over-night march would be
ridiculous. He called the trip a "dream world,"
a "make-believe" one without even a single en
emy behind a bush. Well, perhaps, if there had
been an enemy behind every bush and he had
been fighting for his life he wouldn't be thinking
about a Good Humor Man (but the ice-cream
company was probably glad of the free adver
tising even if it was without the bell).
The real basis of his criticism can be found,
I think, in the fact that "young" Bill was the
"fun-loving Rover" and was rather irked at the
soft, comfortable cars whizzing past while HE
had to drive a horse, which is work.
He completely lost sight of the purpose of the
trip. Instead of taking it for what it was, a prac
tice march with full equipment so that if he
ever had to go to war he would at least once
in his life have gone through the "signal prac
tice" of setting up camp in the dark, locating an
enemy, even if only imaginary, figuring data to
shoot at him, and pulling out of position before
he was blown out. But he was the "fun loving
Rover" and probably took his fun with him.
There are some reasons for our lack of mech

anization and they are dollars. The ones which
Congress failed to appropriate at the end of the
first World War. With the money that the army
had, it held experiments to determine the mod
els that would go into production when the
funds did come.
The U.S. army has modern tanks, guns,
trucks, and rolling hospitals. And whether or
not the equipment we use is the newest, the
process to be applied is the same; the methods
are the same. One deosn't give a beginning
horseman a thoroughbred to learn on.
To say that the "R.O.T.C. is nothing but a
glorified fraternity and most of its 'young offi
cers' will probably turn out to be draft dodgers,"
is rather an immature calumny and very unjust,
but then in this case he may know whereof he
speaks, as he is an R.O.T.C. officer.
"Young" Bill wants to be taught to "fix a motor
car," and "operate a portable radio" and such
things. If that is the case he should not have
come to Stanford and taken an officer's train
ing, but gone to a trade school and become'an
enlisted man.
"Young" Bill states that "the only time we
ever saw any pep or energy around the R.O.T.C.
was preparing for the annual 'officers' ball'."
With statements like this along with the others
in this editorial, it seems "young" Bill has taken
this opportunity to describe his own feelings
and experiences in R.O.T.C. training.
It is the pleasure and freedom of a man to
take a crack at West Point if he feels the urge,
but to say that a West Point officer has the
"worst head for figures" sounds rather odd
when the great majority of people know that
it has higher math requirements than almost
'any other school and that its undergraduate
-curriculum is engineering. As far as the "best
polished shoes in the business" goes, I like well
polished shoes. I think they look better than
dirty ones, and the polish is certainly good for
the shoes.
• Our army is sound; its principles are sound
in spite of the grandstand quarterbacks who,
according to the grandstand quarterbacks, know
best. "Young" Bill's rhetoric was excellent, how
ever, and his effort well written, doing his re
vered and loved father justice; but it was not
so humorous as it was ludicrous.—George His
lop.
In yesterday's Daily Bill Rogers criticized
the U.S. army system. Today, with full space
at his disposal, George Hislop replies to Rog

THIS is supposed to be an answer to Bill
Rogers, son of the late Will Rogers. Young
Bill was a Stanford graduate and a member of
the Stanford R.O.T.C. unit, but above all he was
a polo player. He had "A's" in polo. The Uni
versity regulations state that in order to play
polo, the individual must be enrolled in R.O.T.C.
training. Thus it is with this background of
"A's" in polo and "D's" in most of his other
military courses that young Bill states, "We have
had some experience with the U.S. army, and,

To say that the "R.O.T.C. is nothing but a
glorified fraternity and most of its 'young offi
cers' will probably turn out to be draft dodgers,"
is rather an immature calumny and very unjust,
but then in this case he may know whereof he
speaks, as he is an R.O.T.C. officer.
"Young" Bill wants to be taught to "fix a motor
car," and "operate a portable radio" and such
things. If that is the case he should not have
come to Stanford and taken an officer's train
ing, but gone to a trade school and become'an
enlisted man.
"Young" Bill states that "the only time we
ever saw any pep or energy around the R.O.T.C.
was preparing for the annual 'officers' ball'."
With statements like this along with the others
in this editorial, it seems "young" Bill has taken
this opportunity to describe his own feelings
and experiences in R.O.T.C. training.
It is the pleasure and freedom of a man to
take a crack at West Point if he feels the urge,
but to say that a West Point officer has the
"worst head for figures" sounds rather odd
when the great majority of people know that
it has higher math requirements than almost
'any other school and that its undergraduate
-curriculum is engineering. As far as the "best
polished shoes in the business" goes, I like well
polished shoes. I think they look better than
dirty ones, and the polish is certainly good for
the shoes.
• Our army is sound; its principles are sound
in spite of the grandstand quarterbacks who,
according to the grandstand quarterbacks, know
best. "Young" Bill's rhetoric was excellent, how
ever, and his effort well written, doing his re
vered and loved father justice; but it was not
so humorous as it was ludicrous.—George His
lop.
In yesterday's Daily Bill Rogers criticized
the U.S. army system. Today, with full space
at his disposal, George Hislop replies to Rog
ers' statements. Neither editorial necessarily
reflects official Daily attitude.—The Editor.
THIS is supposed to be an answer to Bill
Rogers, son of the late Will Rogers. Young
Bill was a Stanford graduate and a member of
the Stanford R.O.T.C. unit, but above all he was
a polo player. He had "A's" in polo. The Uni
versity regulations state that in order to play
polo, the individual must be enrolled in R.O.T.C.
training. Thus it is with this background of
"A's" in polo and "D's" in most of his other
military courses that young Bill states, "We have
had some experience with the U.S. army, and,
frankly, we don't think very much of the U.S.
army system." This is not an attempt to blacken
the name of "young" Bill Rogers at all, but it is
an attempt to show the unsound background
upon which he is basing his arguments.
He puts in the claim that "it is more than
old-fashioned; it is fossilized." If he means that
we still have generals who give their orders to
colonels, who in turn pass them along to majors,
who shout them to captains, who bluster them
to the shave-tails, yes, the army is old-fashionad;
but, then, so is every other army in the world
today. Even Goering is a marshal and carries
his baton wherever he struts.
But, perhaps he means that every second lieu
tenant who comes into the army should imme
diately, be given an opportunity to try his one
brain-within-a-brain child.
The army is slow at times. It feels its way
along testing this rifle, that tank or machine gun,
to see if it will stand the pressure on the field
of battle or whether, instead, the rifle will be
come so hot the barrel warps and the soldier
will be left to fight the enemy with his bare fists
at 200 yards.
"Young" Bill is quite right in saying that a
person doesn't mind doing his share so much
when he is able to see the results; but an officer
with the training that was offered Rogers should,
with a small amount of effort, be far-sighted
enough to put the jigsaw puzzle of infantry,
artillery, coast guard, anti cavalry together and
see the results.
"Young" Bill's lament about the use of cavalry
and horse-drawn artillery instead of the new mo
torized units is colored for his use and without
fact to back it up.
Over half of the German artillery is still horse
drawn, and the German army has over three
quarters of a million horses in use today—this
does not include those in the supply columns.
The use and importance of the horse-drawn ar
tillery is vastly underrated. It takes over six
months of intensive training and maneuver to
properly prepare a battery for active service,
to teach the men horsemanship, teach them the
care of horses so that they will be able to pull
the heavy cannon day in and day out. YET
practically every man on the campus can step
into an automobile and drive it. Once a man
has been trained in a horse-drawn outfit, it re
quires only a week or so to turn him into a well
trained motorized man.
To dwell upon the exaggerated facts in his
description of the over-night march would be
ridiculous. He called the trip a "dream world,"
a "make-believe" one without even a single en
emy behind a bush. Well, perhaps, if there had
been an enemy behind every bush and he had
been fighting for his life he wouldn't be thinking
about a Good Humor Man (but the ice-cream
company was probably glad of the free adver
tising even if it was without the bell).
The real basis of his criticism can be found,
I think, in the fact that "young" Bill was the
"fun-loving Rover" and was rather irked at the
soft, comfortable cars whizzing past while HE
had to drive a horse, which is work.
He completely lost sight of the purpose of the
trip. Instead of taking it for what it was, a prac
tice march with full equipment so that if he
ever had to go to war he would at least once
in his life have gone through the "signal prac
tice" of setting up camp in the dark, locating an
enemy, even if only imaginary, figuring data to
shoot at him, and pulling out of position before
he was blown out. But he was the "fun loving
Rover" and probably took his fun with him.
There are some reasons for our lack of mech

anization and they are dollars. The ones which
Congress failed to appropriate at the end of the
first World War. With the money that the army
had, it held experiments to determine the mod
els that would go into production when the
funds did come.
The U.S. army has modern tanks, guns,
trucks, and rolling hospitals. And whether or
not the equipment we use is the newest, the
process to be applied is the same; the methods
are the same. One deosn't give a beginning
horseman a thoroughbred to learn on.
