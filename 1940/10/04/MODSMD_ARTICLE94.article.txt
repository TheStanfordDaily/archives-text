# BULL SESSION

### BUD AMES 
DID YOUR PARENTS TELL YOU?
to everybody, their relatives came over
to dis'a contrie on the Mayflower on that historic
vox age over .300 years ago. It must have been a pretty
packed voyage with all those hundreds of thousands
of relatives aboard. Maybe the Mayflower made three
or four trips?
Well, having your folks come over on the Mayflower
is just a part of our native, our inherent love of
America and of being an American. Your mother
probably told you all about the Pilgrim fathers and
all about how they (quote) "set out to seek in-DEE
pen-dance and freedom in a new world" (unquote).
It is a beautiful tale, one you could always turn to
in your hour of spiritual need. BUT—yesterday an
economics lecturer burst that pretty bubble.
The soap tastes bitter on our lips.

HPHE Pilgrim fathers were nothing but squatters,
land jumpers. And they never should have set
foot on the Plymouth rock.
You sec, son, the Plymouth fathers had made cer
tain land agreements, with an English company (set
tling America). The winds blew the wrong way, and
our fathers landed in the wrong place—right on the
lands of Ihe English Plymouth Company. So, they
had to make a lot of new arrangements.
Isn't thai awful? Couldn't you just cry? It was so
nice just having the Pilgrim fathers land and just
claim the land like mother told us. This sort of rocks
the foundation of "America, democracy, life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness." But I wouldn't tell
your mother, 'cause she'd be terribly disillusioned
about the whole thing.
* «i't «Jt i|:
'JpilE bubble may have burst. Education bursts a lot
of dream bubbles. America, however, still remains
as nice as ever to live in. Education has taught us that
many of our parents' stories about honor, and respect,
and patriotism weren't actually true. It is the in
tangible things that these stories represent which are
the truths. Honor, respect, and patriotism exist after
the stories about them are gone.
Well . . . ?
That is, they will exist if you don't kill them like
this patriotic woman who went bubbling into a large
department store in Los Angeles. Rushing to the
jewelry counter, she gurgled something about 'the
patriotic spirit of today," and then she asked, "Have
you got any of those jewelry American-flag pins in
any other colors except red, white, and blue, so they
will match my different outfits?"
