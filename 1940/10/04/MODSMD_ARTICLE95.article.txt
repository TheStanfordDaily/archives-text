# CAMPUS OPINION
## BREAKERS FEEL BROKEN 
### 
'yHE EDITOR. SIR:
I completely fail to see the humor in your article
on politics which referred to the Breakers' Club as a
"haven for campus hermits—averse to women." Per
sonally, I feel that this is a gross injustice to the cluh.
Of course, I don't know for sure that I speak for all
the members of the club.
Is not the writer of this article making an error in
alleging thai the club's opposition to exchange dinners
is likewise an aversion to women? The only people,
men or women, who go to exchange dinners, are those
who fail to glance through the S.A.E.'s picture book of
the Stanford campus. We are not such egotists to be
lieve we are different from the other students, so we
nip the project in the bud.
If you were attempting to be humorous, it was
about on par with your other attempts. In fact, it was
better than Bull Session usually is.
Webster defines "haven" as meaning a "bay of
water" and that definition of our club is true, .'is your
writer may find out by coming to lunch tomorrow.
The remainder of your quotation I disagree with, and
so might A1 Roth, who was a Breaker, although your
article several days ago apparently was afraid to
classify him as a hermit.
Yours truly,
''''l Indignant Breaker
