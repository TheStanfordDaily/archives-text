### 
Into "Jacohy's Corners" Jake FalstafT, Ohio's Carl Sandburg. packed
all the memories of his farming boyhood, and of the wisdom, humor
and aflfection that his grandparents brought from Europe to sow in a
green American valley.
Jacohy's Corners is a tight little village that has been settled by mem
bers of the Coffee Pot Church, a branch of the Amish faith. The men wear

long straight beards and to miss
reading the Bible before meals is
to bring the wrath of God upon your
house.
GRANDSON ARRIVES
Young Lemuel Hayden arrives in
Jaeoby's Corners to spend his va
cation with his grandparents Nadeli.
He traveled from New York on the
Number Sixteen "Flier." He came
the whole way in the smoking car
because, as he got on the train, he
noticed that all the women went into
one car, the men into another.
Lemuel learns many things from
his Uncle Valentine, who manages
the Nadeli farm. He observes that
a horse is built exactly right to
hold the harness. He learns that
dehorning a cow is quite different
from trimming a horse's hoof, for
there is a nerve running up to the
tip of the horn.
He learns that in addition to
apple cider there is also pear cider.
The Nadelis have grape and cherry
and dandelion wine to offer their
visitors, in addition to the precious
elderblossom wine.
HELLION BAPTIZED
He meets up with Coonie Ehrsam,
the town hellion, who, to the amaze
ment of the village ciders, had
signified a desire to join the church.
Instead of the usual two-year pro
bation period his was extended to
four years, just to be sure. He was
admitted to the congregation when
he was twenty, and the date for his
baptism was set.
On that day it came out why
Coonie had been good for four years.
When he came up from the complete
immersion he squirted a mouthful
of water straight into the air like
a whale. It was for this moment
that Coonie had been patient against
his impulse and good against his
nature. Afterward he became a
young hellion again.
This book of reminiscences gives
a pleasant picture of rural life a
generation ago. The best things all
seem to be gathered together here.
Read this for a sentimental evening.
The population of China in the
year 11)81 was about 60.000,000.
