/ OCTOBER 17, 1940 . . . "The Sec
ond World War."
That's the day Japanese newspa
pers have set for the start of the sec
ond World War of the twentieth cen
tury. Tokyo does not consider the
conflicts raging now in Europe,
Asia, and Africa of sufficient im
portance to state that a world war
is already in progress.
So one influential Tokyo news
paper specifically declared yester
day that the reopening of the
Burma Road would precipitate
war with Great Britain and pos
sibly with the United States.
Britain has publicly announced its
intentions of reopening this vital
supply link with China just one
day after our own national regis
tration day. Today, the govern
ments of the United States, Japan,
and Russia are to he told offi
ically of the reopening of the road,
although it has been known since
last Tuesday (hat Britain would
take this action.
id * #
IT was on July 19 that Prime Min
ister Winston Churchill an
nounced to a sullen House of Com
mons that his government had con
cluded an agreement with Japan
whereby the Burma supply link was
to be closed for three months and
Japan on its part was to try to
make an "amicable settlement" with
China.
The move at the time looked like
a British appeasement plan in the
Far East, although keen observers
were quick to point out that rainy
weather during much of the three
months would preclude the road's
use.
But Japan during the past several
weeks evidently has considered that
she can have her way in the Far
East—that Britain Is too hard-pressed
at home and in the Mediterranean
to help China on the other side of
the globe.
Japan, like Germany and Italy,
took too lightly the one country
with which she does not want to
tangle—the United States.

SECRETARY OF STATE Cordell
K Hull less than two weeks ago
had an important meeting with
British Ambassador to Washington
Lord Lothian. It was rumored im
mediately following the conversa
tions that Hull had demanded the
reopening of the Burma Road to
give our new 25 million dollar loan
to China some teeth.
Now. when the rains stop in
mid-October, coolie caravans,
laden with supplies and war ma
terials, will resume their trek
northward from the Bay of Bengal
to China's interior.
Just what 25 million dollars
worth of additional imports from the
United States can mean to strengthen
Chinese resistance is specualtive.
However, in 1938 (the last year in
which figures have been released),
China's total imports from the
United States amounted to only 47
million dollars. Japan felt each one
of those dollars.

provisional capital at. Vichy in

enter the war to fight Britain were

was conspicuously lacking. . . . Pre

his own plane, made an extensive
tour of military units in northern
Italy. . . . Herbert Morrison, Brit
ain's new minister of Home Security,
threw out reams of red-tape yester
day in an effort to do absolutely
everything possible to provide for
Britain's homeless population. . . .
Washington draft officials announced
that, there would be a "most lib
eral" interpretation of the term
"dependent" in selecting men for
military service.

/ OCTOBER 17, 1940 . . . "The Sec

That's the day Japanese newspa
pers have set for the start of the sec
ond World War of the twentieth cen
tury. Tokyo does not consider the
conflicts raging now in Europe,
Asia, and Africa of sufficient im
portance to state that a world war
is already in progress.
So one influential Tokyo news
paper specifically declared yester
day that the reopening of the
Burma Road would precipitate
war with Great Britain and pos
sibly with the United States.
Britain has publicly announced its
intentions of reopening this vital
supply link with China just one
day after our own national regis
tration day. Today, the govern
ments of the United States, Japan,
and Russia are to he told offi
ically of the reopening of the road,
although it has been known since
last Tuesday (hat Britain would
take this action.

IT was on July 19 that Prime Min
ister Winston Churchill an
nounced to a sullen House of Com
mons that his government had con
cluded an agreement with Japan
whereby the Burma supply link was
to be closed for three months and
Japan on its part was to try to
make an "amicable settlement" with
China.
The move at the time looked like
a British appeasement plan in the
Far East, although keen observers
were quick to point out that rainy
weather during much of the three
months would preclude the road's
use.
But Japan during the past several
weeks evidently has considered that
she can have her way in the Far
East—that Britain Is too hard-pressed
at home and in the Mediterranean
to help China on the other side of
the globe.
Japan, like Germany and Italy,
took too lightly the one country
with which she does not want to
tangle—the United States.

SECRETARY OF STATE Cordell
K Hull less than two weeks ago
had an important meeting with
British Ambassador to Washington
Lord Lothian. It was rumored im
mediately following the conversa
tions that Hull had demanded the
reopening of the Burma Road to
give our new 25 million dollar loan
to China some teeth.
Now. when the rains stop in
mid-October, coolie caravans,
laden with supplies and war ma
terials, will resume their trek
northward from the Bay of Bengal
to China's interior.
Just what 25 million dollars
worth of additional imports from the
United States can mean to strengthen
Chinese resistance is specualtive.
However, in 1938 (the last year in
which figures have been released),
China's total imports from the
United States amounted to only 47
million dollars. Japan felt each one
of those dollars.
