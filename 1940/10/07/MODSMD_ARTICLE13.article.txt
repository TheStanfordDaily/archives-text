Students having articles stolen
from their cars at the end of last
Spring Quarter should report the
losses, said Gordy Davis, campus
police officer. "Perhaps we have the
articles among those retrieved by
us," Davis stated.
A series of thefts from campus
cars were perpetrated during finals
of Spring Quarter, but. the re
sponsible party was apprehended
and the stolen goods were recovered.
Most of the articles have been re
turned to their rightful owners, but
the campus police are still in pos
session of a number of them.
