# Cards Beat Oregon 13-0 For First Conference Victory In Two Years
## Indians Score Twice in Two Quick Thrusts 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Those Stanford Football fans
who couldn't believe their ryes
a week ago found out again last
Saturday that they have a win
ning team to root for.
Paying oil on two of its three
scoring opportunities, this team,
Coach Clark Shaughnessy's In
dians, rolled through Oregon 13-0
to win their lirst Coast conference
football game in two years.
The efficient Cards struck once in
both of the first two quarters and it
looked for a while that they were
.going to maintain the touchdown-a
period pace they set in their opening
game.
After the fury of an early Web
foot drive burned out when Hugh
Gallarneau and Frankie Albert re
covered an Oregon fumble on their
own 10 and after Stanford had
pulled itself out of this home hole
mainly by the punting of Norm
Standlee, who was kicking all of
them 50 yards, the Indians were
poised on their 28 for their first ot
two similar touchdown trips.
THE FIRST MARCH
The first march was engineered
mainly by Albert and Standlee.
There was a pass, Standlee to Al
bert, with that classic but highly
profitable bobble by Frankie. Then
passer and receiver changed places
for another completed pass and an
other good gain.
Albert, looking for a receiver, de
cided to run and picked up 13 yards.
Now it w-'s thf "Chief's" turn, and
he powers ough tackle for 14
and a first down on the Ducks' 3.
From there Pete Kmetovic flashed
into the end zone for the score on a
weak side play.
SCORE MUFFED
The only scoring chance the In
idans muffed was set. up by that
beautiful 50-yard gallop by Gallar
neau which missed by a whisker of
going all the way. With Kmetovic
holding the ball on the 39-yard line,
Albert attempted a field goal, but
the ball fell a little short and to the
right.
Soon after the Cards had their
second touchdown on another 70-
yard tour which was opened by a
nifty 25-yard jaunt by Gallarneau,
who was a consistent long gainer
Saturday. Standlee hit for 8, and
the Cards made it first down on the
35. Standlee threw to Albert again
for 14 and another first down. It
took Shaughnessy's boys 7 short
gainers from there and Albert finally
sneaked the final few inches for the
score.
OFFENSE BOOS DOWN
However, what was a highly suc
cessful and satisfactory game to the
fans was only a mediocre perform
ance to players and coaches. In the
second half the Big Red Machine
did litlle more than sputter on of
fense, but it did stop several threats
by a respectable powerful Oregon
eleven.
Vic Lindskog, Chuck Taylor, and
Rod Warnecke were working over
time on defense, stopping the swift
Buck Berry and Len Isberg and the
powerful Marshall Stenstrom. It
took Standlee's soaring punts to
keep the Ducks back-pedalling when
the linemen were not stopping
them.
PASS DEFENSE GOOD
The one department, of the game
in which the Indians were 100 per
cent perfect was their pa.ss defense.
The Ducks launched 9 aerial at
tempts and the alert Card backfield
