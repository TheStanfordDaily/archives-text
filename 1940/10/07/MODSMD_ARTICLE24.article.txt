LONDON. Monday. Oct. 7 (11*). —Howling, gale-like winds early today
shielded the British Isles from Nazi raiders as Adolf Hitler's aerial siege
of London entered its second jnonth.
Confident thai the siege is losing its fury,* oflieials said that Britain's
expanding defenses are "wearing down" the Germans. Confidential sta-

tistics show a 75 per cent drop in.
I deaths and a 25 per cent reduction
I in injuries in a week's time,
j RAIDERS STRIKE ISLES
During Sunday's daylight hours
"dive and run" raiders struck wide
spread at the British Isles, machine
gunning streets of some towns and
in the heart of London burying sev
eral families in the debris of their
J homes.
At Folkestone on the Channel
Coast five Messersehmitt-109 fight
ers, each carrying 250-pound bombs,
were reported to have attacked
workers' residential areas, killing a
j number of mer», women and chil
dren.
NO ATTACK ON LONDON
At midnight, however, no attack
was in progress against London for
the first time since the start of the
"total" attack on 7 and there
I had been no activiy since an "all
clear" signal early Sunday night.
Now and then gun flashes were
seen far to the east neai; the Chan
nel coast. The bad weather was be
lieved to be holding the raiders off
all England as well as London.
Rounding out the first month of
j "total war" against London, the
j Nazis were unrelenting in theic
Sabbath attacks after London's
longest night raid of her 00-day
siege in which 37 districts were
I bombed.
