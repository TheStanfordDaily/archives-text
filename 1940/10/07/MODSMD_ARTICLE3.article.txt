# Japan Warns U.S. Against Anglo Treaty
## Reopening of Burma Route Serious Move, Advises Tokyo Paper 
### 
TOKYO. Oct. 6 (UP).—Reopen
ing of the Burma route to China
through Anglo-American co-op
eration—expected on Oct. 17, ac
cording to London dispatches —
would lead to world war, the news
paper Hochi said today.
"The Pacific Ocean is facing im
minent danger, wherefore it is ad
visable for the United States to
avoid any silly move or commit
ment," Hochi said.
London dispatches, indicating that
the Burma Road would be reopened
by Britain on Oct. 17 after being

closed three months by agreement
with Japan, said that Washington
and London had been in close con
sultation on the situation and that
Washington had made known its
desire to see the route reopened. Ex
cept for the overland route from
Russia, the Burma route is the sole
remaining outside contact of the Na
tionalist Chinese govei-nment at
Chunking and the only route over
which military supplies may be ob
tained from Britain or the United
States.
AMERICAN RESPECT'
The newspaper Chugai said the
fate of the Pacific Ocean depends on
whether or not the United States
respects Japan's position in the Far
East.
The Mikayo said that Premier
Prince Fumimaro Konoye repre
sented the sentiment of the entire
nation when he said last week that
the signatories of the Tripartite
Pact were determined to aeeept the
challenge of any power.
Further friction with Britain was
reported in Nichi Nichi, which said
that the New York office of Nippon
Yusen Kaisha, great Japanese ship
ping company, had notified the
N.Y.K. head office that British au
thorities were detaining at Bermuda
the Japanese ship Hakone Maru.
The dispatch also said that it was
feared the Bakozaki Maru, due there
tomorrow, would be detained.
(A Bermuda dispatch Saturday
said that the Hakone Maru had
been released and was en route to
New York.)
