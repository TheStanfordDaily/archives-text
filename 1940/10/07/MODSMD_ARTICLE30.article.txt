## 
### 
'I lie Stanford freshman football
team put 011 one concentrated
drive late in the second quarter
fcr their first score, and then added
two more tallies on spectacular
breaks to knock over San Mateo
.1. C., 21 -I), in the Stanford Sta
dium Saturday.
Frank Forbes, little reserve left
ball, started the ball rolling with
Joss than three minutes remaining
in the first half with a pass to End
./in) Ellis. '1 he play, good for 16
yards, was followed by an 18-yard
drive to the 2-yard line with
Forbes, Bob Koch, and Randall
Fawcx tt alternating at carrying the
bull.
Faweett drove over from the 2-
yard marker on a smash at the
middle, and Ellis' kick was good for
Ihe extra point.
i IIIIJI) QCARTER UNEVENTFUL
Throughout the third quarter the
Papooses and Bulldogs more or less
•tymied one another. However,
when the fourth quarter got under
way San Mateo, trying hard to tally,
gave the lrosh another scoring op
portunity, and Right Halfback Koch
took advantage of it.
Clay Benham, Bulldog full, faded
back and let fly with a pass to the
Papoose left flat, but Koch cut in
front of the intended receiver to
intercept the pass and sped 80 yards
down the belt) for a touchdown.
KOCH SCORES AGAIN
Cutting back and forth behind the
inl rlerence he picked up, Koch
made good use of his blockers and
•'an the last ten yards unmolested.
Ellb again split (he uprights with
his conversion attempt.
Bill Nourse, one of the Papoose's
three outstanding flankmen, made
the break that led to the final score
for Stanford. On a third-down punt
by Benham, Nourse smashed in to
block the kick and recover the
bounding ball on the San Mateo 29-
yard line.
INDIANS CONTINUE DRIVE
I" rom that point Forbes rambled
around the San Mateo left wing for
8 yards, and Koch, who was prob
ably the outstanding back on the
field Saturday, slashed off-tackle for
a first down on the Bulldog 15-yard
marker. Koch carried the ball
twice more on line plays for a total j
ul yards, and followed this with
n«;ther off*tockle jaunt for a first
down on the S'i-yard line.
On first down Forbes ran the end
lor the final score of the game. The
extra point, was once more the re
sult of Jim Ellis' educated toe.
Although San Mateo did show a
spurt of offense once in a while, the
Papoose eleven managed to stifle
most of the Bulldog's forward ad
vances. and at no time after their
first score were Coach Harry Ship
key's charges in serious danger of
losing their lead.
Hard-running Bob Koch gave
evidence of becoming an asset to
Coach Shaughnessy's varsity next
year, as he turned in an outstanding
performance both as a passer and a
runner. In the line Loren LaPrade
played some good ball, especially on
def< nse, where he made any number
of brilliant stops.
The frosh play U.C.L.A. frosh in
Los Angeles next Saturdav.
