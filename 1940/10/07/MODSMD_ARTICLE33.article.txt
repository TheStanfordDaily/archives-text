# Marjorie Gestring Quits Springboard for Law
## 
### HAP EVERETT 
It won't he long now before the Law Steps will he one of the main
centers of attraction on the campus, for a pretty Los Angeles blonde, Mar
jorie Gestring, has enrolled at Stanford to learn the why's and where
fores of the legal profession.
In fact the lure of the law school is causing the queen of American
diving to remain out of competition for the rest of the school vear.

'"I think I'll stick to
diving until next summer," Miss
Gc.string said Saturday. "Then I'll !
have to get into shape."

This is a break for Helen Crlen
kovich because Margie has had the !
San Francisco girl's number re- j
cently, winning back (he national
crown this summer after "Crinky"
had upset her in Des Moines the
previous year. Marg avenged her
'3'.) defeat last month in Portland and I
is now undisputed champion. How
ever, she has decided to pass up the j
Far Westerns at Fleishhacker Pool 1
October 12 and 13 and the indoor 1
championships this winter.
"I can't take time off from school
to go back for the indoor meet," '
she told us last week and added
that Beverly Beck, up and coming '
young diver from Salt Lake, would
give Miss Crlonkovich a lot of
trouble.

As you might expect, Marg is not
the usual naive freshman. The !
diving campaigns have taken her
to every section of the country and
a great many of her friends and ac
quaintances are big shots in the
sporting world. Ever since she
copped the 19r.fi Olympic spring
board lit' • at Berlin, Margie has
been in the aquatic spotlight, hav
ing held the national championship
for four of the last five years and
the U.S. high tower crown since
1938.

Marg says she loves Stanford and
it seems the reverse may be true
too as our interview was cut short
by the intervention of a couple of
male admirers Saturday morning.
For the time being anyway, she
wants to be just another Robleite
and get into the Stanford way of
life. She isn't going to worry too
much about diving until spring.
Asked about Stanford's Ernst
Brandsten, the "A. A. Stagg of div
ing," Margie told us:
"Ernie is a swell guy and I'm
counting on him to give me some
valuable coaching before next sum
mer's campaign."
CONVINCES LOCAL FANS
Marg easily convinced 1800 fans
that her championship was no fluke
when she put on a beautiful ex
hibition Friday night at the Junior
Pacific A.A.U. event.

copped the 19r.fi Olympic spring
board lit' • at Berlin, Margie has
been in the aquatic spotlight, hav
ing held the national championship
for four of the last five years and
the U.S. high tower crown since
1938.

Marg says she loves Stanford and
it seems the reverse may be true
too as our interview was cut short
by the intervention of a couple of
male admirers Saturday morning.
For the time being anyway, she
wants to be just another Robleite
and get into the Stanford way of
life. She isn't going to worry too
much about diving until spring.
Asked about Stanford's Ernst
Brandsten, the "A. A. Stagg of div
ing," Margie told us:
"Ernie is a swell guy and I'm
counting on him to give me some
valuable coaching before next sum
mer's campaign."
CONVINCES LOCAL FANS
Marg easily convinced 1800 fans
that her championship was no fluke
when she put on a beautiful ex
hibition Friday night at the Junior
Pacific A.A.U. event.
It won't he long now before the Law Steps will he one of the main
centers of attraction on the campus, for a pretty Los Angeles blonde, Mar
jorie Gestring, has enrolled at Stanford to learn the why's and where
fores of the legal profession.
In fact the lure of the law school is causing the queen of American
diving to remain out of competition for the rest of the school vear.

'"I think I'll stick to
diving until next summer," Miss
Gc.string said Saturday. "Then I'll !
have to get into shape."

This is a break for Helen Crlen

San Francisco girl's number re- j
cently, winning back (he national
crown this summer after "Crinky"
had upset her in Des Moines the
previous year. Marg avenged her
'3'.) defeat last month in Portland and I
is now undisputed champion. How
ever, she has decided to pass up the j
Far Westerns at Fleishhacker Pool 1
October 12 and 13 and the indoor 1
championships this winter.
"I can't take time off from school
to go back for the indoor meet," '
she told us last week and added
that Beverly Beck, up and coming '
young diver from Salt Lake, would
give Miss Crlonkovich a lot of
trouble.
