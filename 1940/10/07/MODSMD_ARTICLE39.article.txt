DR. WILBUR told two representatives of the
Associated Students last week that he
would discourage the formation on the Farm
of Willkie-for-President or Roosevelt College
Club units.
He averred that Stanford men and women
should not campaign for one man or one candi
date, but should align themselves with Young
Republican or Young Democrat groups, already
in existence.
From the standpoint of Public Exercises Com
mittee this idea may have some value. It sim
plifies the political picture by limiting partisan
groups. But its disadvantages are far greater.
As one of today's Campus Opinioners de
clares, it forces many intelligent independents
to march under a party banner. In addition, it
implies that all persons who support Roosevelt
are Democrats and all persons who back Willkie
are Republicans.
The issues which face an American voting
populace are, this year of all years, not strictly
party ones. Surely no one would call the mat
ters of national defense, conscription, diplomatic
maneuvering with South American powers ques
tions of a partisan nature.
It is equally illogical to bind together all up
holders of one candidate under the label of that
man's party. Implying that Americans vote "a
straight ticket" because of party affiliation is to
overlook a large section of the country's elec
torate —a group that picks its leaders for the
stands they make and not for the parties they
represent.
