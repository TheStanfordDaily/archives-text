THE alarm sounded yesterday in Encina. And
Stanford's fire department sped to the scene,
ready to protect life and property.
Of course the alarm was false, the prank of a
freshman jokester. Inside the stone chimney
that houses 553 new Stanford men, bull-session
ers last night may have thought it a clever stunt.
Like many youngsters they liked to see a fire
engine; they loved the sound of the siren, the
clang of the bell.
But today, when they learn that Encinaites will
be assessed about SlOO for the moment's fun of
one resident, their grins may fade a little. There
is no guestion that Encina is a fire-trap. It is
ideally constructed to cremate a whole crop of
the Farm's future graduates. Furthermore, it is
foolish to discuss at length the stupidity of an
individual who toys with the lives of his friends.
Societies have written and enforced laws that
protect themselves against such actions.
And Stanford's society is no different than
any other. The action in yesterday's case is
clear. Human life is no plaything—call that Rule
One in the frosh book of "Things I've Learned
at College."
