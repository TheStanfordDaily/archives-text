# A 						Fair Code
## 
### 
WHEN Edwin N. Atherton, Commissioner of
Athletics for the Pacific Coast Conference,
recently banned a dozen prep football players
from competing at Southern California, U.C.L.A.,
and California, the latter two schools accepted
the bans with disappointed shrugs.
From Atherton's testimony they knew that
they were in the wrong, according to the new
code of rules drawn up last spring. The Univer
sity of Southern California, which in justice it
might be said took the biggest beating in the
deal, was not guite so philosophical about it. It
was apparent from the official attitude at the Los
Angeles institution that there was no other al
ternative than to accept the ineligibilities, but
there were illy-muffled grumblings from promi
nent Trojan alumni.
Now the underground grapevine has it that
certain U.S.C. graduates would gladly support
their alma mater if it decided to withdraw from
the Conference and go on a free-lance schedule,
such as Notre Dame, for example.
Their argument is sound, perhaps. U.S.C.,
poorly endowed, needs its tremendous football
receipts, not only for running athletic expenses,
but also for academic and building expenditures.
It is a fairly well known lact that U.S.C borrowed
money from a Los Angeles bank, offering their
expected football returns as collateral.
lust what would happen to the Conference if
these impulsive alumni were to prevail is a moot
guestion. But right here at Stanford the consen
sus is overwhelmingly in favor of the Atherton
Code, and stringent observance of it.
Whether Trojan alumni realize it or not, the
Atherton Code is one of the finest breaks am
bitious and deserving young high school ath
letes have ever received.
On the new basis, created by Atherton's laws,
a football player assumes the status of an actual
member of the student body. He is no longer a
person aside from the other students, but is com
peting on the same academic basis for his
' bread and butter." (Providing the Code is rig

idly observed.)
The scholarships he gets are open to non
athletic undergraduates. The old "caste" sys
tem, distinguishing between an athlete and a
"student," will largely be done away with.
This may not be what U.S.C. wants. It is cer
tainly what Stanford desires.â€”G. M.
