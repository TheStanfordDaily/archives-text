### BUD AMES 
NOTES FROM A CELLULOID CUFF
jyjONDAY morning, and that makes it. the curtain
raiser on another week. There are just 80 days
until Christmas, and nine days until all hearty males
of lethal age register for the compulsory training serv
ice—or else. So you might as well forget about those
30 days.
They pass quickly when one has crept to arms in
defense of one's country.
This Christmas, stockings will be hung on the rifle
racks, and 'Silent Night" will be sung to the tune of
'God Bless America"—minus Kate Smith.
Yesterday's papers, however, held some hope for
you males and potential widows. Word has it that
within a few days President Roosevelt is expected to
order automatic deferment from compulsory training
of all eligible men who have dependents.
Why not try raising leeches on your arm.
Right now, nothing would be more pleasing to the
eye and the ear than a healthy mother-in-law who
has lost both arms and legs in a train wreck.
The Mormons had the right idea.

| AST week was indeed a busy, busy one for Presi
dent Roosevelt. In one speech he stated, "The
third term is a dead issue." So is Wendell Willkie.
He wishes.

Rockctts passed a pleasant after-
noon last Saturday playing a combination of bas
ketball and button-botton-who's-got-the-button with
a bunch of frequently unconscious roughies from up
Oregon way. The sight of all those cold green pickles
lying all over the field would have gladdened the
heart of Mr. Heinz.
Things are getting so complicated out on the field
that several of last Saturday's rooters may not attend
next week's game. A nearby rooter complained that
he only saw the ball when Oregon was on the
offensive.
A member of the Stanford varsity made the same
complaint.
Faking and deception is so perfect that our back
field men now have to look down twice to make sure
they are or aren't carrying the ball.
Oregon almost bottled up our offense by sending
out a man to trail our flank runner. Santa Clara is
going to go Oregon one better this Saturday by sending
out a man to trail the man who is trailing our flanker.
This Saturday you can expect uniformed midgets
and a pack of wild elephants. As an encore Shaugh
nessy will personally saw a woman in half.

of elephants, a recent New York poll ex
k pects that Republican candidate Willkie has in
creased in popularity in that state. Another poll says
no. Yes, no, yes, no.
This business of taking polls on everything from
political beliefs to wedgies is cleaning up. They give
us a cross section of public opinion. Now what is
needed is a poll on polls to tell us which ones arc
telling the truth.
