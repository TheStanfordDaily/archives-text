# CAMPUS OPINION
## PERSHING WAS A BLUNDERER 
### 
HTHE EDITOR, SIR:
We wish to compliment The Daily for printing
Rogers' editorial on the notorious inefficiency of the
military class, and especially of the American branch
of it. Before entrusting our lives and future into
their hands, let us examine their record and who
they are.
The principal source of our leaders is that institu
tion at West Point, where all the aspirants are ap
pointed on a political basis by politicians, and with no
particular attempt to get men with a broad intellec
tual background. Here they are taught football, ball
room dancing, and how to cheer in unison. Any origi
nality they might have possessed is knocked out by
the rigid tradition-bound discipline ard scientific
patriotic indoctrinaton.
Other officers are chosen from the R.O.T.C.'s of the
nation. These men are often taught nothing but how
to keep in step and salute. In high school the only
fellows who took R.O.T.C. were those who feared
skinning their knees in gym classes. Certainly here at
Stanford these men are not our intellectual cream,
nor are they any physical ball of fire.
The quality of leadership represented by General
Pershing in the last was was of a very low character
and this can easily be shown by simply referring to
Ihe poor man's memoirs. He labors under the delusion
that the tradition of the French army was a defensive
one in 1914, and for this has been laughed at by every
competent critic of the war. He also naively asserts at
every opportunity that it was the "dirty Huns" who
started the war, and thus, that they deserved every
thing they got and more. This viewpoint is explicable
if Pershing were writing for public consumption dur
ing the war, but no other Allied statesman is thick
enough to maintain this fiction in his memoirs. Per
shing had to be forcbly restrained from executing his
Mexican cavalry charges against German barbed wire
and machine guns.
Are we to entrust our nation to blunderers such as
these, men who in May, 1940, were screaming that the
Nazis were going to run out of gas any minute, appar
ently on the basis that they themselves would be un
able to maintain the supply if they were in charge. The
thousands of lives thrown away in the disaster of the
Mouse-Argonne by incompetent militarists led by
Pershing cannot be recovered, but we must see that
the bloody and futile tragedy is never repeated.
