r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
In regard to the article in Friday's Daily giving
President Wilbut's opinion on the formation of po
litical clubs, I should like to ask what he or others of
his sentiment think of my opinion that the alignment
of students in clubs according to political party is not
aligning them according to opinion.
Thus any real meaning of the clubs or groups is
lost, the organzations merely nominal groups in this
case without any common purpose or opinion. It is
qutie reasonable to imagine a young Willkie-favoring
Democrat who wouldn't be seen at a meeting of Young
Republicans, but who would gladly and with some en
thusiasm join a Willkic group; and t may work in
reverse.
But imagine the dilemma of the young Democrat
who cannot join the Democrats' Club with full heart
due to his Willkie beliefs and wouldn't consider the
Republicans' Club. There are many such people. Re
publican and Democrat, and the candidate-clubs would
solve their problems and surely be acceptable to all.
Why not?
Sincerely,
D. H. W.
