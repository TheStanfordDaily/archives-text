## 
### 
"The guy who rings the cash reg
ister" spoke last Thursday evening
in the War Memorial Opera House
in San Francisco. He was also de
noted as a "genius of intellectuality
and the creator of Information,
Please" by Dean Maddox, NBC-man
and emcee for the night. He is Clifton
Fadiman, who spoke for an hour and
a half on almost nothing important
and had his audience in the red
plush aisles.
The interlocutor for the quiz show
sponsored by that sparkling bever
age outlined the inception and appar
ent rise of Information Please. Then
he spoke generally, mighty gener
ally, on the inside workings of radio.
"When I tell anyone that Infor
mation Please is completely unpre
meditated and strictly ad lib, they
look at me with a leer," complained
Fadiman. "But I assure you it is."

The pivotnian explained that the
program receives about 30.000 ques
tions a week from persons who all
want to win sets of the Encyclopedia
Brittanica. Questions are selected for
their usability and distributed
equally geographically. A corps of
four girls are kept busy daily and
nightly listening to all other quiz
programs, so that "Info-please" won't
duplicate questions.
Fadiman gave thumbnail sketches
of his trigger brain compatriots. He
labeled Franklin P. Adams as being
able to remember every single thing
that happened up to 30 years ago.
Of John Kieran, Fadiman explained
that he went to college, but the only
difference in his education is that
Kieran remembered what he was
taught. Oscar Levant was chosen for
his knowledge of music.
SKETCHES COMPATRIOTS
Men make better guest experts
than women, Fadiman said. He laid
this to the fact he, Fadiman, gets
courtly every time he addresses the
woman guest, making the usual free
and easy give and take a sort of the
18th century schoolroom.—Steele
