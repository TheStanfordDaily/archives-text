Listed below are ratings of all residences and student organizations for

The column headed Standing shows how the ratios of the individual
groups compare with the average of the University. The difference be
tween the University average (2.57) and a perfect score (4.00) is divided
into ten equal parts, and each group average is numbered according to the
interval in which it falls. Thus a group whose standing is "-(-2" has an
average between 2.72 and 2.85, inclusive. The same intervals are used
to indicate ratios below the University average.
