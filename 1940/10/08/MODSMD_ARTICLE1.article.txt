ried the following comment in its
news columns last Friday:
"The Axis (Italy and Germany) is
out to defeat President Roosevelt
. . . because of everything for
which he stands in the eyes of the
Italians and Germans." If this re
mark had come during the political
speech of an ardent Roosevelt boost
er, no comment other than the ordi
nary political refutation from the
opposition would be necessary.
But this quotation appeared in the
story of the Times' able Rome cor
respondent, Herbert Matthews, writ
ing from Italy. If there was any
substance to such a contention, Mat
thews would be in a position to get
it at its source, the Italian capital.
Matthews statement was no polit
ical chatter.
Matthews was ordered expelled
from Italy yesterday on the
grounds that this item in his Fri
day dispatch from Rome "tended
to disturb relations" between Italy
and the United States.
The reasoning of the Italians here
is obviously inconsistent, for on the
one hand they insist they are not in
terested in America's presidential
election and then on the other hand
they throw Matthews out of the
country for saying the Italians want
Roosevelt defeated.

JJNFORTUNATELY for Americans
the question of Axis interest in
our election has been made a cam
paign issue. The dispatch from Rome
does lend support to the claim that
Willkie is "Hitler's (and Mussolini's)
unwitting candidate for President of
the United States."
Plausibility of the claim has been
strengthened with the disclosure in
New York that every pro-Fascist or
pro-Nazi organization operating in
the United States has been further
ing the contention that Roosevelt is
a war-monger and that only through
his defeat in November can peace be
assured the United States.
The dictators know from Roose
velt's acts as well as from his words
that he is unalterably opposed to
Axis world domination. They know
that Willkie by his words has taken
a similar stand.
But Willike has not been instru
mental in sending 50 destroyers to
Britain, Willkie has not been at
the head of a government that has
extended two large loans to be
sieged China, Willkie has not been
a decisive factor in bringing about
America's huge rearmament pro
gram, Willkie, in short, has not
had the opportunity to show so
conclusively where he stands.

out to defeat President Roosevelt

which he stands in the eyes of the
Italians and Germans." If this re

speech of an ardent Roosevelt boost

opposition would be necessary.
But this quotation appeared in the
story of the Times' able Rome cor
respondent, Herbert Matthews, writ

substance to such a contention, Mat

it at its source, the Italian capital.
Matthews statement was no polit
ical chatter.
Matthews was ordered expelled
from Italy yesterday on the
grounds that this item in his Fri
day dispatch from Rome "tended
to disturb relations" between Italy
and the United States.
The reasoning of the Italians here
is obviously inconsistent, for on the
one hand they insist they are not in
terested in America's presidential
election and then on the other hand
they throw Matthews out of the
country for saying the Italians want
Roosevelt defeated.

the question of Axis interest in
our election has been made a cam
paign issue. The dispatch from Rome
does lend support to the claim that
Willkie is "Hitler's (and Mussolini's)
unwitting candidate for President of
the United States."
Plausibility of the claim has been
strengthened with the disclosure in
New York that every pro-Fascist or
pro-Nazi organization operating in
the United States has been further
ing the contention that Roosevelt is
a war-monger and that only through
his defeat in November can peace be
assured the United States.
The dictators know from Roose
velt's acts as well as from his words
that he is unalterably opposed to
Axis world domination. They know
that Willkie by his words has taken
a similar stand.
But Willike has not been instru
mental in sending 50 destroyers to
Britain, Willkie has not been at
the head of a government that has
extended two large loans to be
sieged China, Willkie has not been
a decisive factor in bringing about
America's huge rearmament pro
gram, Willkie, in short, has not
had the opportunity to show so
conclusively where he stands.
