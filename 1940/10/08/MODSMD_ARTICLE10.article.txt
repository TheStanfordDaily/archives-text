# Artist McLellan Lampoons, Streamlines Big Red Machine
## 
### JAN GOULD 
Listen to the story of the Big
Red Machine—and its 1940 stream
lining by Ed McLcllan.
For Coach Shaughnessy and the
"T" formation aside, it's Ed, the
photolith designer and compositor
of the University Press and cartoon
ist extraordinary, who scrapped the
steam roller of the Vowing Sophs
and put the little football Indian in a
dizzy racing car to take the turns
and straightaways for the rest of
the season.
He began the Friday before the
game with U.S.F. by drawing a Daily
cartoon of the redskin racing his
car toward the Don, and greeted the
Oregon tilt with a hit-and-run
driver. So far Ed has had to draw
only two cartoons, his usual pro
cedure when the team is winning
and what he calls the "Monday
hangover" doesn't require a tactful
and friendly dismissal in separate
treatment.
FOLLOWS TOMMY'
Ed began drawing cartoons for
The Daily during basketball season
last winter, taking over the job in
the press and as unofficial artist for
student publications left vacant by
Tommy Thompson's going to the
Call-Bulletin in San Francisco. Now
his time is full with his routine
job pasting up photolith pages with
appalling accuracy — his measure
ments run to seventy-seconds of an
inch—drawing cartoons on order and
just for fun, and making special
layouts for press magazines and
books either on or without request.
"I change things," he said in his
pleasant, brief way. "Don't like 'em,
I change 'em.
WHAT IF THEY KICK?
"Sure. Sometimes guys kick; not
much."
He teetered back on the high
stool he never uses except, for after
hours visits and talked about foot
ball, remarking that all the cartoon
ideas are his own, and revealed that
the new Red Machine is the prod
uct of his devotion to auto racing,
for which he is designing his own

The office where he does the
greater part of his wox-k is a crow's
nest above the great camera and the
light tables in the part of the press
devoted to making photolith plates.
Among the pica rules, rubber cement
pots, books of fancy types, jobs
waiting to be sent out, is Ed's private
bulletin board which contains lam
poons of anyone who strikes his
fancy, an effigy of a Daily worker
hanging by the neck, and photo
graphs of Mr. Shaughnessy and his
favorite grease pencil drawings of
Farm basketball heroes.
Ed came to the press one year
ago from an advertising agency in
San Jose, where he used to draw
sports cartoons and layouts for the
San Jose News and Mercury Herald,
and was chief artist for the north
ern California and Nevada Ford
dealers.
Football cartoons for The Daily he
does in pen and ink, drawing with
both hands, while the basketball
layouts for last season were grease
pencil and coquille. Asked the per
centage of providing art for the
newspaper, covers for Chaparral, and
continual small "spots" and layouts
on jobs that come into his office, he
said:
"Tommy paved the way. I like it.
And it makes a nice feeling between
the press and the student publica
tions."
