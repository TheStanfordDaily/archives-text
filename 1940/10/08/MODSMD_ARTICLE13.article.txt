# Ex Committee To Correlate Farm Drives
## 
### 
Bob Newell, chairman of the
family callâ€”Stanford fund drive,
will present his plans to Execu
tive Committee tonight, and sub
mit his recommendations for
committeemen to Excom's ap
proval.
The Red Cross drive is to be con
sidered also and a correlation of all
campus drives will be attempted
following a report by Bob Low and
Anne Townsend who have investi
gated the situation and interviewed
members of the University adminis
tration.
Also on the agenda, according to
Bruce Jessup, will be the question
of revising the A.S.S.U. constitution
presented last week by Wilson
Cannon.
It has been recommended to the
committee, said Jessup, that all or
ganization chairmen as well as com
mittee heads be required to leave
complete reports for their succes
sors in office. This mandatory pol
icy, to apply to both appointive and
elective student body positions, will
be decided at tonight's meeting.
To supplement the existing fac
ulty committee for national de
fense, Stanford students have been
requested to form a similar com
mittee; the extent of A.S.S.U. co
operation will be determined by Ex
Committee tonight.
Other items on the agenda for to
night's meeting include discussion
of the Big Game Dance, revision of
athletic awards, and occupancy of
rooms in the Old Union.
