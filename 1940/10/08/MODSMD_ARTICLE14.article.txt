Bob Beckham was clected presi
dent of a group of Roosevelt-for-
President enthusiasts meeting in
conjunction with the Young Demo
crats yesterday afternoon in the
Nitery. Ray Stahl was named vice
president.
Following the installation of offi
cers, the group discussed the possi
bility of contesting campus Willkie
ites in an open forum debate. Rep
resentatives of the recently launched
Stanford Forum suggested that three
members of each political club ap
pear on the same platform at the
Forum's opening meeting in the near
future.
Final business of the afternoon
was the setting of a "victory" rally
for the night of Election Day, No
vember 5, at which election returns
would be heard.
