| TORONTO, Ont., Oct. 7 (UP).â€”
Canada's aerial war effort is pro
ceeding at a pace well beyond the
most optimistic expectations, James
S. Duncan, Deputy Minister of Air,
said today.
'At this moment," he said, "we
have more men overseas, more men
on home defense, more men in
training, more schools in operation,
I more aerodromes constructed, and
more buildings ready for occupation
: than were contemplated in our
original plans.''
