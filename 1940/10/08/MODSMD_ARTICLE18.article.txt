# Lunchers to Hear Of Boom in Flying
## 
### 
Professor David L. Webster, ex
ecutive head of the Department of
Physics, will be Luncheon Club's
next guest speaker. Talking upon
"Wings Without Murder," Dr.
Webster will discuss the present
boom in private flying as the re
sult of the C.A.A. program.
Though at present the airplane
is used primarily for military pur
poses, Dr. Webster foresees a time
whtn its greatest use will be for
private flyingâ€”a time when people
will make cross-country jaunts in
airplanes much the same way as
they make them today in auto
mobiles.
