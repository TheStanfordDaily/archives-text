PROPOSED AMENDMENT
The proposed amendment to the
oenstitution provides that all candi
dates for student office must be
members of the A.S.S.U. at the time
of their election. The suggested
change will amend Article I, Section
2, of the Constitution. The full
amendment with the change given in
capital letters runs as follows:
"All regularly enrolled students of
Stanford University at Palo Alto,
graduates and undergraduates, are
members of this Association. Only
members of this Association shall be
entitled to vote in any Association
election, TO BE ELECTED, to hold
Association or class offices, or to rep
resent Stanford in any intercolle
giate activity."
AROSE LAST SPRING
The question of this amendment
arose during last spring's general
election, when Bruce Jcssup, "at that
time candidate for the A.S.S.U. presi
dency, was not enrolled in school.
At that time a ruling was made by
Dr. Wilbur, requiring Jcssup to reg
ister.
Two of the three positions to be
filled, those of B.A.C. representative
and Graduate Man on Ex Commit
tee, will run until next spring. The
Men's Council post is for a half term
only, as Roy Trowbridge, whose
withdrawal from school this fall
caused the vacancy, had served a
half year.
