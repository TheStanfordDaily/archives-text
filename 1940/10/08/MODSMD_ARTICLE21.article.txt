# Governor Olson Approves Bill barring 'Reds'
## Alien Control Cited As Communist Party Erased from Ballot 
### 
SACRAMENTO, Oct. 7 (UP).—
Governor Culbert Olson tonight
Mailed a legislative ail outlawing
(he Communist party from the
California ballot with a strongly
worded attack on political parties
controlled by alien governments.
Olson cited the Communist party's
own publications and sworn state
ments of its officers that the party
should be classified as foreign
controlled "and far that reason
should not be entitled to legal rec
ognition in the political life of
America."
The Legislature passed the anti-
Comnjunist bill Sept. 22 with one
dissenting vote in the Senate and
l luce in the Assembly. The Gover
nor's signature, scratched tonight as
he concluded a radio broadcast ex
plaining his action, will make the
bill effective after 90 days and will
not affect the November 5 election.
ACTION DEMANDED
"At this critical time in the world's
history and in our international
relationships," Olson said, "senti
ment against alien-controlled par
lies in the United States has virtu
ally become a demand Tor legis
lative action. It has been aggra
vated by the scurrilous methods and
abusive manner in which Commu
nists, either openly or under cover,
carry on their political activities."
Olson said he did not find in the
bill "any impairment of the right
of freedom of speech or of assembly
or any of the civil liberties guaran
teed by the American Constitution.
"There is not a word in the bill
which would disqualify, for a place
on the ballot, any American party
devoted to the elimination of the
capitalist system and the establish
ment of socialism in the United
States."
CONSULTS LIBERALS
Olson consulted outstanding lib
eral attorneys and said, "I have
carefully analyzed this bill, par
ticularly from the standpoint of
safeguarding the fundamental prin
ciples of American civil liberties."
"It would seem that few, if any,
American citizens could be found
objecting to the disqualification of
a party affiliated with a foreign
government or which advocates the
overthrow by unlawful means of,
or a program of sabotage, force and
attack against, the government of
the United States or of this state,"
the Governor said.
"Such irrational objections can
not be reconciled with a sense of
loyalty to American institutions."
If a man could jump as well in
proportion to his size as the frog
hopper insect, the broad jump rec
ord would stand at about one-third
of a mile.

SACRAMENTO, Oct. 7 (UP).—
Governor Culbert Olson tonight
Mailed a legislative ail outlawing
(he Communist party from the
California ballot with a strongly
worded attack on political parties
controlled by alien governments.
Olson cited the Communist party's
own publications and sworn state
ments of its officers that the party
should be classified as foreign
controlled "and far that reason
should not be entitled to legal rec
ognition in the political life of
America."
The Legislature passed the anti-
Comnjunist bill Sept. 22 with one
dissenting vote in the Senate and
l luce in the Assembly. The Gover
nor's signature, scratched tonight as
he concluded a radio broadcast ex
plaining his action, will make the
bill effective after 90 days and will
not affect the November 5 election.
ACTION DEMANDED
"At this critical time in the world's
history and in our international
relationships," Olson said, "senti
ment against alien-controlled par
lies in the United States has virtu
ally become a demand Tor legis
lative action. It has been aggra
vated by the scurrilous methods and
abusive manner in which Commu
nists, either openly or under cover,
carry on their political activities."
Olson said he did not find in the
bill "any impairment of the right
of freedom of speech or of assembly
or any of the civil liberties guaran
teed by the American Constitution.
"There is not a word in the bill
which would disqualify, for a place
on the ballot, any American party
devoted to the elimination of the
capitalist system and the establish
ment of socialism in the United
States."
CONSULTS LIBERALS
Olson consulted outstanding lib
eral attorneys and said, "I have
carefully analyzed this bill, par
ticularly from the standpoint of
safeguarding the fundamental prin
ciples of American civil liberties."
"It would seem that few, if any,
American citizens could be found
objecting to the disqualification of
a party affiliated with a foreign
government or which advocates the
overthrow by unlawful means of,
or a program of sabotage, force and
attack against, the government of
the United States or of this state,"
the Governor said.
"Such irrational objections can
not be reconciled with a sense of
loyalty to American institutions."
If a man could jump as well in
proportion to his size as the frog
hopper insect, the broad jump rec
ord would stand at about one-third
of a mile.
