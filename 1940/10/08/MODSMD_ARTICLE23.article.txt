# Lomita Drive To Be Widened
## 
### 
The second stage on the $20,000
Lomita Drive improvement project
along the west side of the Quad
which will soon begin, is expected to
be completed within the next month,
according to Alfred L. Trowbridge,
assistant comptroller.
The plan provides for the widen
ing of Lomita Drive for 200 â€¢ feet
from the Santa Teresa Street corner
near Ruble toward the Geology Cor
ner on the Quad, and the storm
drain under the Searsville Road is
to be extended to the other side of
Serra Street opposite the Physics
Corner.
A concrete curb will be con
structed around the large oak trees
which, in the completed project, are
to be in the middle of Lomita Drive.
The cost of the present work is
$2,500. Work on the grading of the
drive to the future width of the
street has been finished, and when
(he project is completed the Farm
will have a street 60 feet wide from
the Roble Corner to the Physics
Corner.
The Board of Trustees is expected
to appropriate funds for a sidewalk
from the Chemistry Building to
Santa Teresa Street.
