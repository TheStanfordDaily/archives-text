# Strike Slows Plane Building
## Construction of Paly Factory Threatened 
### 
A strike which may tie up a vital
defense industry by threatening the
right of an employer to pick his
workmen broke out here today,
when pickets took up posts in front
of the Jack-Heintz airplane parts
plant. Construction was halted on
the plant, which is in the process of
being erected on the Middlefield
road just outside the Palo Alto city
limits.
Carpenters left the job, following
the refusal of the company to ac
| cede to the demand of the San Fran
cisco chapter of the A.F.L. Inter
national Association of Machinists
to sign a contract which would give
it sole bargaining power for the
plant's employees.
The carpenters who began work
this morning were later called off,
| according to Ralph Heintz, vice
president of the concern, who said
that four machinists did not show
! up at work today as a result of the
union's actions. There are approxi
mately 30 machinists employed, he
added.
Heintz said the question of a bar
gaining agent has not been put up
to a vote of the company's em
ployees in accordance with the Na
j tional Labor Relations Board's pro
! cedure.
Further, he pointed out, his com
pany has contracts with the federal
government in connection with the
i national defense program, and it is
essential that it have full control
in employment matters, since secret
processes are involved in its inves
tigation. According to Heintz, the
company pays the union wage, and
i more,
The plant is expected to be com
pleted about the middle of next
week. Machinery will then be
moved in. By the middle of No
i vember. Heintz said, the number
ol employees will be increased to
about 100, and sometime next year
will rise to about 300.
