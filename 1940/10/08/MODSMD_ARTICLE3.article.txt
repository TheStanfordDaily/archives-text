of warfare," reliable German
quarters said early today.
The number of German troops

TROOPS TO RUMANIA
German quartei's confirmed that
one mixed Nazi division — about
15,000 troops —has been assigned to
Rumania to begin immediate in

divisions in the German methods of
warfare. The first contingent of
this division now is on Rumanian
soil, it was said.
The Germans will be divided into
smaller groups, setting up head

Constanza, Brashov, Ploesti and
Dadilov.
OIL SABOTAGE
Constanza is Rumania's big port
on the Black Sea while Ploesti is in
the heart of the oil fields, 35 miles
north of Bucharest, where seven
British subjects aiTested recently
are alleged to have conspired to
sabotage the Rumanian oil supplies
upon which Gei'many depends.
Brahsov is 85 miles north of Bu
charest.
Unofficial reports circulated in
Bucharest that a total of three Ger
man divisions might be sent into
the country, with full approval of
Premier lon Antonescu and his new
totalitarian regime.
AGREEMENT RUMORED
Well-informed German quarters
confirmed to the United Press that
an agreement had been l'eached and
already was operating between Ger
many and Rumania providing for
German, training of the Rumanian
army.
These sources said that "German
training companies" had been as
signed to Rumania and that Ru
mania also would send non-commis
sioned officers to Germany, where
they would receive training.
The German army units arriving
in Rumania were said to -carry full
motorized equipment. The remain
der of the first division of German
troops will enter Rumania shortly, it
was stated in the German circles.
RUMANIA DENIES NAZIS
The official Rumanian radio Mon
day night again denied that there
was any intention of a German "oc
cupation" of Rumania and added that
the most cordial relations exist be
tween the German and Rumanian
soldiers.
The German general staff in Bu
charest, it was learned, will be es
tablished in headquarters in the im
posing Stirbey Voda Building in the
central part of the capital. Pre
viously the building was the head
quarters for now-exiled King Car
ol's palace guard.
The Chitila Building in a railroad
center five miles north of Bucharest
has been vacated by a Rumanian
motorized regiment to make room
for the German army guests.
