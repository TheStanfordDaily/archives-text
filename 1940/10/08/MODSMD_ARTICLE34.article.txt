### JERRY BRUCKER 
twice-tied U.S.C. Trojans
had better watch their step
when they invade Champaign to
tangle with Bob Zuppke's Fighting
Illini.
The Iliini squad that dropped a
2(5-0 game to the Jones boys last
year is pretty well riddled by grad
uation, but Zuppke is the upsetting
kind of coach. The genial Illinois
merttor never has a great deal of
material, and manages to pull a
couple of real surprises every year.
A paragraph from the Illinois stu
dent publication that serves to illus
trate the way they feel about the
game back there runs as follows:
"For the Southern California ;
game, tlie committee is planning
to furnish orange and blue gas
filled balloons for members of the
roeting section, to be released
after the first Illinois touch- ;
dawn."
So you see, they're going to quite |
an expense back there to celebrate j
only the "first" touchdown.

the second consecutive week j
the Keeble pen award went to
an Indian lineman.
Dick Palmer, first-string right
guard, received the award for the !
bang-up game he turned in help- I
ing to drop the Oregon Ducks i
Saturday. Center Vic Lindskog 1
won the award in last week's j
U.S.F. walkover.

Nort Thornton's water polo team
grabbed third place in the five-team
Pacific Junior A.A.U. tourney held
in Encina Pools over the week-end
in spite of the fact that the squad
had only seven days of practice.
Members of the squad were given
bronze medals because of their
showing.
The Card waterdogs have a tough
row to hoe this season. U.C.L.A.
gets top rating in the Southern divi
sion of the Conference, having their
entire team on hand that won the
championship in '39.
California showed a fine squad
also in winning the tournament
Saturday. The Winged O outfit
that the Bears vanquished, 8-7. in
the finals had defeated Stanford,
11-3, the night before.

A S FAR as we know, this takes
; the prize for peculiar situations.
Stanford has the material for a
really good tennis team this year.
Back from last year are Larry Dee,
Jim Wade, and Bob Low. Dee and
Wade won the National Collegiate
Doubles Championship this summer.
Added to this trio is Charles
Hutchison, who defeated Ted Schroe
der and Ed Alloo in the Pacific
Southwest Tournament in Los An
geles last month.
And the catch to the whole
thing is that at present there is no
Stanford tennis coach!
The B.A.C. failed to renew Sherm
Lockwood's contract last May, so we
understand, and no appointment has
been made to fill the vacated posi
tion. It looks as though this all-star
collection of Card netmen will have
to coach each other.
