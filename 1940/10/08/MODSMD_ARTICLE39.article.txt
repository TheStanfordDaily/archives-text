# Soot bailers Suffer Injuries, Prep for Santa Clara Eleven
## 
### 
A sloppy practice field was the least of Coach Clark Shaughnessy's wor
ries as he ran his varsity footballers through yesterday's session. Mr.
Shaughnessy's troubles may be. for the present, summed up in a few
words—Broncos and minor injuries.
With U.S.C. tumbling into another tie, with Washington already once-

beaten and none too impressive in<
their win over Idaho, and with U. C. |
L. A. now a twice beaten team, it
looks as though Stanford's most dan
gerous opponent of the 1940 season
will be Santa Clara.
The Broncos, who will invade the
Indian stadium next Saturday,
passed U.C.L.A.'s Jackie Robinson
and Co. dizzy to beat them 9-6. Mr.
Shaughnessy already knows that
they have a powerful ground attack
for he saw them run rough-shod
over Utah 34-13.
As for the injuries that are both
ering Mr. Shaughnessy, none are of
a really serious nature. First
stringers Frankie Albert, Fred
Meyer, and Dick Palmer were ab
sent from practice because of pain
ful charley horses. Vic Lindskog
and Chuck Taylor, though they
were in uniform, were operating
under half steam because of minor
hurts.
WILL SEE ACTION
None of these boys will be unable
to .see action against Santa Clara, but
they might have to miss some of
this week's valuable practice ses
sions in preparation for the Broncos.
This in itself is rather serious for
the Cards are getting another big
dose of razzle-dazzle.
Shaughnessy also stressed the im
portance of mid-week practice by
explaining Frank Albert's inaccuracy
on several pass plays last Saturday
was caused by Frank's missing
workouts for three days early in
the week.
Thor Peterson, tough-luck grid
der, was back in harness again yes
terday. Thor was being groomed to
back up Norm Standlee's fullback
spot again as he did last year when
he cracked a couple of ribs in a
pre-season scrimmage. Yesterday he
was romping about the practice field
with a protective brace for his ribs,
but he won't be in line for any
heavy work for a week anyway.
WILLARD REINJURED
Another of Stanford football's
tough-luck kids was limping around
at yesterday's session. He was big
Bill Willard, first-string end two
seasons ago. Warming up for the
opening game of last season Will
badly twisted a knee and was lost
to the team for the season.
An operation last spring was sup
posed to have fixed him up for good
but on the second play Bill partici
pated in since way back in 1938, his
bad knee was reinjured. Dr. Paul
Davies, team physician, has rigged
up a brace which may enable Wil
lard to play but at present the in
jured leg is a mystery.

bad knee was reinjured. Dr. Paul
Davies, team physician, has rigged
up a brace which may enable Wil
lard to play but at present the in
jured leg is a mystery.
A sloppy practice field was the least of Coach Clark Shaughnessy's wor
ries as he ran his varsity footballers through yesterday's session. Mr.
Shaughnessy's troubles may be. for the present, summed up in a few
words—Broncos and minor injuries.
With U.S.C. tumbling into another tie, with Washington already once-

beaten and none too impressive in<
their win over Idaho, and with U. C. |
L. A. now a twice beaten team, it
looks as though Stanford's most dan
gerous opponent of the 1940 season
will be Santa Clara.
The Broncos, who will invade the
Indian stadium next Saturday,
passed U.C.L.A.'s Jackie Robinson
and Co. dizzy to beat them 9-6. Mr.
Shaughnessy already knows that
they have a powerful ground attack
for he saw them run rough-shod
over Utah 34-13.
As for the injuries that are both
ering Mr. Shaughnessy, none are of
a really serious nature. First
stringers Frankie Albert, Fred
Meyer, and Dick Palmer were ab
sent from practice because of pain
ful charley horses. Vic Lindskog
and Chuck Taylor, though they
were in uniform, were operating
under half steam because of minor
hurts.
WILL SEE ACTION
None of these boys will be unable
to .see action against Santa Clara, but
they might have to miss some of
this week's valuable practice ses
sions in preparation for the Broncos.
This in itself is rather serious for
the Cards are getting another big
dose of razzle-dazzle.
Shaughnessy also stressed the im
portance of mid-week practice by
explaining Frank Albert's inaccuracy
on several pass plays last Saturday
was caused by Frank's missing
workouts for three days early in
the week.
Thor Peterson, tough-luck grid
der, was back in harness again yes
terday. Thor was being groomed to
back up Norm Standlee's fullback
spot again as he did last year when
he cracked a couple of ribs in a
pre-season scrimmage. Yesterday he
was romping about the practice field
with a protective brace for his ribs,
but he won't be in line for any
heavy work for a week anyway.
WILLARD REINJURED
Another of Stanford football's
tough-luck kids was limping around
at yesterday's session. He was big
Bill Willard, first-string end two
seasons ago. Warming up for the
opening game of last season Will
badly twisted a knee and was lost
to the team for the season.
An operation last spring was sup
posed to have fixed him up for good
but on the second play Bill partici
pated in since way back in 1938, his
bad knee was reinjured. Dr. Paul
Davies, team physician, has rigged
up a brace which may enable Wil
lard to play but at present the in
jured leg is a mystery.
