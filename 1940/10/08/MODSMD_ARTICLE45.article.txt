## JERKY BRUCKER, Sports Editor Bucky Walters Ties Op Series With Shutout 
### 
CINCINNATI, Oct. 7 (UP).—
From the brink of disaster, the
Cincinnati Reds came hounding
back today 011 the strong right
arm of Bucky Walters, the bow
legged pitcher who silenced the
Detroit Tigers' power-house at
tack and hurled the National
League's first World Series shut
out in live years.
With Walters pitching a 5-hitter,
the Reds won the sixth game, 4-0,
and evened up the Series at three
games each. Thus the 3940 World
Series conies to the seventh and pay
off game for the first time since the
Cardinals conquered the Tigers four
games to three back in 1934.
Walters became the first National
League pitcher to register two
World Series triumphs over the
American League since Lon War
neke of the Cubs beat the Tigers
twice in the 1935 classic.
CINCY DEFENSE GOOD
Although the Reds made two er
rors, the famed Cincinnati defense
which set a new major league rec
ord for fewest errors during the sea
son finally became a factor in the
Series. The Reds made three fast
double plays, and all of them came
when they killed off efforts of the
Tigers to start a rally.
Walters didn't need great support
because he was complete master of
the Tigers—all except Dick Bartell
and Rudy York, who made two hits
each and Pinky Higgins, who made
one. Even when the Reds made er
rors behind him to start the eighth
and ninth, Waltei's never wavered
or weakened.
DERRINGER TO PITCH
For mound duty for the seventh
and deciding game tomorrow, Man
ager Bill McKechnie has big Paul
Derringer, who held the Tigers to
five hits in the fourth game after
being knocked out in the opener.
Manager Del Baker of the Tigers
failed to reveal his pitching choice
but it probably will be Buck Nevv
som, who would come back with
one day's rest to try for his third
triumph. No pitcher has won three
World Series games since Stanley
Coveleskie of the Indians did it
against the Dodgers in 1920.
Walters put the finishing touches
on the Reds scoring in the eighth by
belting the home run, a drive of
about 350 feet, off Hutchinson.
Paul Derringer,' ace righthander of
the Cincinnati Reds, will go to the
mound tomorrow in an attempt to
win the world championship of
baseball.
NEWSOM MAY PITCH
Detroit's pitcher for the seventh
and final game was still in doubt
early this evening, but it probably
will be either Buck Newsom, win
ner of two games, or Tommy Bridges,
the little curve ball artist who took
the third game in Detroit.
If Newsom pitches, he will be do
ing so with only one day's rest as
he won the fifth game in Detroit
Sunday with a brilliant shutout.
Newsom, however, is a big, tough
man and never has had a sore arm.
Manager Del Baker of the Tigers
was reticent about his pitching
choice after Bucky Walters won
today's game and said he might wait
until just before game time to pick
his man. One alternative that was
rumored was that Baker would
start Bridges and keep Newsom in
reserve for an emergency.
