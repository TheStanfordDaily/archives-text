yearling griddcrs today started
their preparation for their game
with the U.C.L.A. frosh in the
Southland this week-end.
Although Monday lab work took
its usual toll from the practice ses
sion, Coach Harry Shipkey's third
team slopped through a muddy
workout as they scrimmaged against
the varsity third-stringers, while the
rest of the frosh gridders ran sig
nals.
Should the rain keep up for the
remainder of the week, the Papoose
squad will have a tough time get
ting in shape to meet the Bruin Cubs, -
an outfit which last year's fresh
man eleven thoroughly trounced.
This season, however, the southern
gridders are expected to put up a
nluch tougher battle.
Bud Wilson, who was the victim
of an early season injury, was back
in uniform last week and may be
in condition to play some ball this
Saturday. Wilson's return means
that the number of good ends on
the Papoose team runs to five, in
cluding Bill Nourse, Jim Ellis, Bill
Brubaker, and Bud Madden.
