TODAY the Farm will elect three men to im
portant student body positions. The polls will
be open until 2 o'clock.
This special election will provide the first op
portunity for new Stanfordites, transfers and
freshmen, to pick the officials who will repre
sent them in campus affairs. It will comprise the
first actual contact that many men and women
will have with the government of the University.
In addition, and because it comes at the first of
autumn quarter, tomorrow's special election will
provide an ideal opportunity for new Stanford
ites to select this year's list of administrators.
So, vote today. Take the time and trouble —
two or three minutes, actually—to register your
approval of three candidates on today's ballot. It
will be time well spent.
