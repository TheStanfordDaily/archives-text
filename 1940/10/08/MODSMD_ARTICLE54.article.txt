# Ballots and Bananas

SEVERAL hundred thousand American citi
zens will take to the polls in an integral part
of this country in November, and will be handed
no ballot on which to signify their preference
for the next President of the United States; will
cast no vote for Senators and Representatives
who will safeguard their interests in the United
States Congress in Washington, D.C.
Instead these Americans will be handed a
plebiscite ballot on which only an affirmative
or negative answer is required. The question on
this ballot in effect will read, "Do you want
statehood for Hawaii?"
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur of Stanford University
joined those mainland Americans who advocate
the rank of statehood for this vigorous territory
in this month's issue of the Atlantic Monthly.
In his article, "Statehood for Hawaii," Dr. Wilbur
recognizes the "forty-ninth star" as advanta
geous from both the viewpoint of the territory
and of mainland America.
Statehood presents numerous advantages for
the people living on these strategic Pacific is
lands. Not the least of these advantages is the
intrinsic consequence which the recognition and
dignity of statehood would bring. Perhaps of
even more importance are the tangible political
and economic blessings of statehood.
The lack of a presidential vote is but a minor
irritation, as is the appointment rather than elec
tion of a Governor for the territory. Of vastly
greater importance is the lack of voting repre
sentation in the national Congress. An advanc
ing agricultural economy of great productive
value such as Hawaii possesses is entitled to
proportionate representation in Washington.
Instead, the territory plays the part of a "politi
cal beggar" in Congress with her one non-voting
delegate in the lower house. Hawaii's well
being depends upon the "friendship of Con
gressmen from other regions."
Sugar is the backbone of island industry.
Without sugar Hawaii could not long exist. Un
der the present Sugar Act, mentioned in Dr.
Wilbur's article, this industry accepts federal
determination of the acreage it shall plant in
sugar-cane, the wage scale it shall pay, and even
the conditions under which it shall produce
cane. This federal authority is centered in
Washington, where other sugar-producing re
gions have representation. Why not Hawaii?
Continually handicapped by its territorial
status, Hawaii may well build her case for state
hood. But the mainlander may ask: "Will the
state status be equally conducive to national
interests? What will statehood for Hawaii mean
to us?"
The territory has done a fine job. Its civiliza
tion is ready for statehood. The admittance of
the islands as a state would fix our position in
the Pacific . . . unquestionably the ocean of
America's future. As long as it is a territory, our
Pacific problems cannot be entirely settled.
Why then is there still a question as to the
desirability of statehood?
This question was answered by Dr. Wilbur in
the words, ' The crux of the problem ... is the
high predominance of Japanese in the popula
tion of the islands."
An overwhelming percentage of persons of

this ancestry living in the territory are second
and third-generation Japanese. Most of them
have never left the islands; most of them neither
know, understand, nor favor the culture of the
Japanese Empire.
Youngsters of Japanese ancestry presently of
high school age are not attracted by the culture
of their grandparents. They study at English
speaking schools—not Japanese; they favor
western styles—not oriental; they occupy posi
tions of trust in island industries; in short, they
have accepted the American way of living.
But have they been accepted into that life?
Have they been taken within our culture as have
those of every other nationality and race in the
history of the settlement of this country? Should
the attitude toward the Japanese in Hawaii be
based upon misconception of the country from
which they come?
In the words of Dr. Wilbur, "sooner or later
we shall have to recognize that they are a part
of our body politic."
And sooner or later mainland America will
realize that in Hawaii there are the same gen
eral conditions of life, liberty and the pursuit
of happiness that exist throughout the nation.—
W. C.
