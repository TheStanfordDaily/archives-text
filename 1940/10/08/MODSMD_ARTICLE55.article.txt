RAIN or shine, Daily staff will turn up this
afternoon at 2 o'clock to watch Edit Board
stage its weekly burlesque. Frightened by the
influx of tryoutees, Edit Board will meet earlier
for a long rehearsal to iron out wrinkles in the
folio. As tradition decrees, the Associates will
foot the Afternoon Club bill. (Twenty-cent limit.)
Contrary to all propaganda previously issued,
Journalism 121 will meet on Thursday (not Tues
day) and, hence, will not conflict with the Staff
get-together.
