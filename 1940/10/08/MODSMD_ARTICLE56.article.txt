### BUD AMES 
ALL THIS—AND FOR A NICKEL TOO
MELLINKOFF has left this column to
seek more fruitful fields—that of dissecting human
corpses and counting blood corpuscles. But his mas
terful words live after him. The things that Sherm
campaigned for have brought new light into the world,
they have put food in the mouths of starving children,
and instilled happiness into the hearts of thousands.
Today Sherman Mellinkoff is a happy man. The
thing he has fought for has come true.
"It happened, it happened, it realiy and truly hap
pened," Sherman wept into his double chocolate soda
(with nuts). "They've lowered the price of tomato
juice to five cents in the Cellar."
Up until last spring, the price of a small glass of
tomato juice was 10 cents in the Cellar. And a dime
for a large glass. So—Sherman, who was always quick
to realize a crying need, pleaded through this column
for cheaper (you read it right) tomato juice.
Ain't youse glad? (This is written thus intention
ally, for the benefit of all English professors in general
and one in particular.

/JHRISTINE RICKER. director of dining halls, had
A something to say about the whole matter yester
day. "I think I can safely say that the drop in price
of tomato juice is a direct result of Mellinkoff's article.
Sherman was on the Union Board, and he certainly
liked tomato juice."
Good ol' Sherm, always looking after the common
people.
"Things move so fast in the Cellar that the price
of tomato juice sort of got lost," Miss Ricker contin
ued. "But we changed it at Board meeting last spring.
Now you can get an eight-ounce glass of tomato juice
for five cents and a twelve-ounce glass for a dime."
"Wouldn't a person get more for his dime by buying
two five-cent glasses instead of one dime one, Miss
Ricker?"
"They probably could if they're interested in drown
ing themselves in tomato juice."

YV/ELL, so now you know all about the tomato juice.
Now everybody can go into the Cellar and just
drink gallons and gallons of the sticky stuff, 'til it
oozes out of your eyes.
But watch the hasher who waits on you. He may
try to charge you a nickel too much. All the hashers
have been charging a nickel too much on every glass
of tomato juice despite the fact that the price was
dropped at the beginning of this quarter.
You see. Myrtle, nobody told the hashers about the
drop in price. So they've just gone on and on, charg
ing the trusting Stanfordites last year's prices.
This drop in price is going to prove quite a shock
to Mr. L'Omelette and Mr. Dinah. We always did pre
fer tomato juice anyway. And at a nickel cheaper, too.
