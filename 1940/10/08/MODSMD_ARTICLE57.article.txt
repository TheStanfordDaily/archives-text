j r rilE EDITOR, SIR:
The R.0.T.C., along with the regular military
arms and services of the United States, is apparently
now evoking a great amount of criticism. It is nat
ural at a time of national emergency to have the public
verbally attack the status of the training, equipment,
and personnel of our armed forces; we have come to
expect this.
Most of the criticism is arising from the blatant
tongues of the misinformed non-militarists who, dur
ing the years of peaceful transition from one war to
another, have ridiculed military training. Now, as in
the past, when faced by an emergency, they are the
first to adjudge as inferior the training and personnel
of our officer corps.
For the public to condemn the military services of
this nation on the grounds of insufficient preparedness
and training is to condemn an automobile for lack of
speed while driving with the brake on. It is an ac
knowledged fact that the foremost solicitors for an
adequate defense program have been the army and
navy.
The officers of the armed forces of the United States
have a sufficiently sound education in the use of
military strategy, tactics, and weapons. For the most
part they have undergone this training voluntarily.
It is to be hoped in the future that the criticism di
rected at the military will be confined to the censuring
of a national defense program which is insufficient to
produce needed equipment for practical field maneu
vers It is through these maneuvers that education is
applied to field conditions.
It takes one hell of a scare about every twenty years
to wake up the American people to the demands of
our national defense.
