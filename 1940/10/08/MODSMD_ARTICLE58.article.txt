# Mild Western Flicker Rates Special Praise
## 
### 
"Rangers of Fortune" now playing
at the Stanford Theater.
Drama in the Western style is the
bill of fare at the loeal flicker pal
ace. Two dozen or so desperadoes
and an innocent little girl are killed
in the course of the story. The vil
lain is smooth and wears a black
sombrero. The hero is silent and
dark and quite handsome.
We might quit now. The usual
Western plot has been told. Strange
ly this tale of wild ranges and gun
totin' marauders is a little of! the
beaten path. It might be that the
heroine marries the wrong man.
Whatever it is, it's one of the best
sage-brush operas we've seen since
we could get in for a dime.
PRINTER KILLED
Fred and his two pals take up the
torch for a couple of Horace Gree
ley's Western journalists, a 13-year
old girl named "Squib" and her
grandfather. Trouble develops when
the "printin* pair" dceide to print
the truth about the villains of Santa
Marta Valley. The grandfather is
killed and thing really begin to look
black.
In the meantime a girl, Patricia
Morison, gets mixed up in the story
as the inevitable heart interest. But
she marries the wrong man so she's
not important.
MURDER VINDICATED
Things get tough for "Squib," who
has only Mr. Prague, the printer,
left. High point is reached when the
"Santa Marta Courier" prints the
accusation condemning a Mr. Reb
stock, owner of the local hacienda,
as the man behind the crime wave.
Mr. Rqbstock pays the newspaper
office a visit and sets the place on
lire after killing "Squib" and the
old printer.
Fred and his friends set out to
vindicate this action and after con
siderable fighting kill Rebstock and
his gang. The setting is usual as is
the fighting and tough talk. But the
acting is better than ham and the
story has a new twist.â€”Steele
