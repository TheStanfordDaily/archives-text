# Smith Shows Burma Movies Tonight, 7:30
## 
### 
Depicting one of the most vital
thoroughfares in the world today,
Nicol Smith, Stanford graduate,
will show motion pictures on the
Burma Koad tonight at 7:30 o'clock
in the Auditorium of the Memo
rial Hall. He is the author of the
hest seller, "Burma Koad."
Smith was one of the first occi
dental travelers to make a round
trip over the highway, and his pic
ture* of scenes, ancient and new,
along this lifeline of China have won
him praise from film experts.
There are many strange sights
shown along the ancient caravan
route traveled by Marco Polo in the
thirteenth century that has been re
made into modern China's vital link
with the western nations in her
struggle against the Japanese. Mr.
Smith's pictures of the final stages
of the road's construction will show
the ancient temples and shrines
along the way, and his sequences of
the life and customs of these re
mote and mountainous provinces.
GIRLS TAKE OVER WORK
When men workers on the Burma
Road succumbed to malaria under
the strain of such heavy labor, the
work was taken over by corps of
girls under the direction of Sistie
Six, a tribal matriarch, and complet
ed. Women, for some reason, were
found to be less susceptible to at
tacks of malaria than men.
Nicol Smith is a new kind of ex
plorer. He quite frankly goes prob
ing about the far-off corners of the
earth just for the fun of it. His ad
ventures began at the age of 17 when
he swam the Hellespont. On the
same trip he paddled the entire
length of the Danube River in a
canoe.
VISITS SOUTH SEAS
His next journey took him to the
South Seas, where a 300-pound
princess tried to kidnap him and
make him one of her several hus
bands. He has also sailed up the
Kabalebo or River of Death in South
America and visited Devil's Island.
He is one of the few white men to
ever penetrate the interior of re
mote Hainan off the coast of China.
Besides the Burma Road movies,
Smith will show one reel on north
ern Indo-China, including the prov
ince of Tonkin, the port of Hai
phong, and Hanor, the capital of
Tonkin. He will have animated maps
so the audience will be able to fol
low the journey over the Burma
Road out of Indo-China and into
Yunnan over the railroad the Japa
nese are now bombing.
After the lecture, Mr. Smith will
autograph copies of his book,
"Burma Road."
