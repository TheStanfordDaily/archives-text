# Conventions that will really be opened with prayer

### 
Almighty god, we humbly be
seech thee to give this nation strength
... to give our leaders wisdom and
courage ..."
How many times such words have
reverberated through the Party Con
vention halls of America—over bowed
heads secretly busy with large ambi
tions and little intrigues hearing the
old words only as a hungry boy hears
his father's grace before meals.
Next week in Philadelphia next
month in Chicago—will there be one
heart so calculating or so shallow that

it does not lift up into the throat with
that prayer?
► We must go back to the summer of
1864 to find political conventions like
these . . . the summer when Grant
and Lee fought it out. and the gray
and the blue lay in windrows at Spott
sylvania and the Wilderness.
1916 was not like this. There was
war in Europe—but oceans were still
oceans and no American felt that dan
ger was on our doorstep.
What were we so excited about
back in '96? "You shall not crucify

mankind upon a cross of gold!" We
were arguing about what metal our
money should be made of.
What were the Bull Moose doing
in 1912? "We stand at Armageddon
and we battle for the Lord!" They
were saving us from William Howard
Taft and the Payne-Aldrich tariff bill.
Strange things we Americans have
quarreled over. . . in the light of this
hour, when mankind is being cruci
fied upon the hook-armed cross, and
Armageddon flares into world-wide
fury.

► 'Outwardly, perhaps, the Conven
tions of 1940 may seem the same as
those of less portentous years. Again
we shall hear the thrilling Roll Call
of the States—the beautiful and so
norous names. Spanish and English,
Indian and French, whose alphabeti
cal march takes the listener's mind
on tremendous, exhilarating leaps
across the map. Again there will be
blaring bands, flamboyant oratory,
hour-long demonstrations.
But underneath the surface bed
lam, there will be sober recognition

that more than political issues are at
stake; that picking the Right Man
means picking the Right Man for the
country, not just for the Party. The
man who is signed on as captain faces
little likelihood of a calm passage
over glassy seas; the barometer has
already dropped and may go still
lower.
► Even the dullest delegate will ap
proach his job this year with a feeling
of grave responsibility. And that feel

women massed in the 700 seats occu

There in the midst of the oratory
and the cheering, with bands boom

Almighty god, we humbly be

... to give our leaders wisdom and
courage ..."
How many times such words have
reverberated through the Party Con
vention halls of America—over bowed
heads secretly busy with large ambi
tions and little intrigues hearing the
old words only as a hungry boy hears
his father's grace before meals.
Next week in Philadelphia next
month in Chicago—will there be one
heart so calculating or so shallow that

it does not lift up into the throat with
that prayer?
► We must go back to the summer of
1864 to find political conventions like
these . . . the summer when Grant
and Lee fought it out. and the gray
and the blue lay in windrows at Spott
sylvania and the Wilderness.
1916 was not like this. There was
war in Europe—but oceans were still
oceans and no American felt that dan
ger was on our doorstep.
What were we so excited about
back in '96? "You shall not crucify

mankind upon a cross of gold!" We
were arguing about what metal our
money should be made of.
What were the Bull Moose doing
in 1912? "We stand at Armageddon
and we battle for the Lord!" They
were saving us from William Howard
Taft and the Payne-Aldrich tariff bill.
Strange things we Americans have
quarreled over. . . in the light of this
hour, when mankind is being cruci
fied upon the hook-armed cross, and
Armageddon flares into world-wide
fury.

Indian and French, whose alphabeti
cal march takes the listener's mind
on tremendous, exhilarating leaps
across the map. Again there will be
blaring bands, flamboyant oratory,
hour-long demonstrations.
But underneath the surface bed

that more than political issues are at

Almighty god, we humbly be
seech thee to give this nation strength
... to give our leaders wisdom and
courage ..."
How many times such words have
reverberated through the Party Con
vention halls of America—over bowed
heads secretly busy with large ambi
tions and little intrigues hearing the
old words only as a hungry boy hears
his father's grace before meals.
Next week in Philadelphia next
month in Chicago—will there be one
heart so calculating or so shallow that

it does not lift up into the throat with
that prayer?
► We must go back to the summer of
1864 to find political conventions like
these . . . the summer when Grant
and Lee fought it out. and the gray
and the blue lay in windrows at Spott
sylvania and the Wilderness.
1916 was not like this. There was
war in Europe—but oceans were still
oceans and no American felt that dan
ger was on our doorstep.
What were we so excited about
back in '96? "You shall not crucify

mankind upon a cross of gold!" We
were arguing about what metal our
money should be made of.
What were the Bull Moose doing
in 1912? "We stand at Armageddon
and we battle for the Lord!" They
were saving us from William Howard
Taft and the Payne-Aldrich tariff bill.
Strange things we Americans have
quarreled over. . . in the light of this
