# Drama Group Plans Schedule
## 
### 
A new policy stressing co-ordi
nation with the Division of Speech
was discussed yesterday at Ram's
Head's first meeting of the quar
ter, according to President Tony
Cefaratti.
"With the Division's greatly en
larged schedule of productions, it is
imperative that the Ram's Head
shows be arranged to supplement
them, so that conflict will be
avoided," he said.
Jack Temple was appointed as a
special research investigator to work
out this plan, especially in connec
tion with the group's serious efforts,
the one-act plays, and the revived
Ram's Head readings.
Members of Ram's head agreed to
become more active in the Gaieties,
particularly in regard to props, stage
crew, construction, lights, and pub
licity. Jeanne Ames was appointed
secretary for the remainder of the
quarter. She is replacing Lois Feld
heym, who did not return to school.
Redecoration and refurnishing of
the Ram's Head room was turned
over to a committee headed by Bud
Cady. Ash Wilson and Lois Feld
heym will assist him in pricing and
arrangements. Cefaratti declared
that the color scheme will probably
be blue and grey or green and grey.
"They are psychologically 'calm'
colors, and should keep the meetings
in a graver mood," he declared.
It was decided that in the future
the club will meet four times a
quarter, the time of the meeting to
be determined by time schedules
turned in by members and the exi
gencies of Ram's Head productions.
