# Number One news spot in the U. S. A.
## All in!" 
### 
it is the voice of Bill Donaldson, Su
perintendent of the House press gal
lery. Every Friday morning at 10:30
and Tuesday afternoon at 4. that famil
iar call resounds through the oval in
ner room of the White House offices-
And with these two words, as free
of ceremony as the shout of a sub
way guard, proclamation is made that
the accredited correspondents of the
nation's newspapers—7s to 200 strong
—will now proceed to question the
President of the United States.
► Let no foreign newspaperman sup
pose (and several of them are usually
present) that the absence of fanfare
implies any lack of seriousness. Not
these days.
In the doldrums of last winter, the
spot news men in the front row and
the stiff-collared Mark Sullivan at the
rear exchanged many a wisecrack with
the man in the chair. But now the cor
respondents' questions, always pre
pared in advance and carefully word
ed, are asked with a full sense of their
national and international import.
The front row may occasionally re
lieve the tension with a jest, but for
the most part the problems of the
hour are too harsh and dire for any
thing but the gravest faces, the most
searching and genuine thoughtfulness
on both sides of that famous, gadget
laden desk.
► Number One news spot in the
U. S. A.? Yes, and in this portentous
year of 1940, it may well be more
than that. For this year, a World War
and an American presidential elec
tion cross each other's paths—a meet
ing more weighted with destiny than

any conjunction of planets.
Third term possibilities ... changes
in defense plans . . . developments in
foreign policy.. . no newsman can go
through these doors now without feel
ing that he may come out with a story
for the history books.
► Not always have the Presidential
doors swung open to correspondents.
Most 19th century Presidents, even
Lincoln, were suspicious of newspa
permen. But during the reign of the
unbending Cleveland, a reporter
named Bill Price hit on the scheme of
hanging around the White House gate
to buttonhole the departing visitor,
and he soon had plenty of imitators.
It was Theodore Roosevelt who
first saw the possibilities in that little
group of gate-watchers. One rainy day
soon after the assassin's bullet had
catapulted him into the Presidency,
he called them in, gave them an ante
room of their own, ana established
the custom of face-to-face question
ing of President by press.
► This journalistic questioning has
really become part of the American
governmental process. It means that
Democracy gets more than lip service
between elections. It means that it is
somebody's regular job to report to
the stockholders of U. S. A., Inc. what
their chief has on his mind. Extended
to all other public servants in Wash
ington, it means that the citizen learns
what the government is doing, and the
government learns what the citizen is
thinking.
White House coverage, of course, is
only a fraction of the complicated
Washington assignment. The queer
little political island of D. C.is dot
ted with news sources. There is the

Senate, which can (and has) upset the
Presidential foreign affairs apple cart.
There is the House, which must untie
the purse strings for every Presiden
tial project. There is the Supreme
Court, which can topple his legisla
tion after it's all signed, sealed, and
delivered. And the Executive Depart
ments .. . and the 79 independent ad
ministrative agencies . . . and the for
eign embassies and legations ... all
gushing news from time to time faster
than the White House itself.
► It's no job for an amateur —and
there are no amateurs in the Washing
ton correspondent corps. Many have
been foreign correspondents in impor
tant European capitals, editorial writ
ers on great metropolitan papers,
managing editors or city editors. Many
write books, magazine articles, syndi
cated columns. Though their median
age is only 37, every one has proved
himself on some lesser firing line. And
they are paid accordingly... $25,000
for the tops, $6000 for the average.
No other group in Washington is
their superior in intelligence. None
