# Who rides after Paul Revere?
## 
### 
"TT TAKE up! WAKE up! The Ger-
V V mans are marching! . . . Wake
up! Wake up! The brownshirts are
coming!"
Once more America hears that ring
ing shout of alarm, with only two
words changed after 165 years.
► Since the tenth of May. every fly
ing bundle of newspapers that thumps
against a way-station platform has
been the thunderous knock of the
rider sent out by the lantern signal
in the Old North Church. With edito
rial and news dispatch, cartoon, col
umn, and special article, the far
sighted among America's newspapers
have roused the town and the country
side.
Never had citizens been more
soundly asleep in their complacent

beds. "Safe behind three thousand
miles of good green water". . . smugly
confident of the power and might of
friendly former allies . . . blandly in
different to the condition of our fight
ing forces . . . blind to sinister stirrings
in neighbors to the south and even in
our own midst.
That voice in the darkness, that
knock at the door came not a moment
too soon.
► Where and how the present-day
menace to freedom will strike, no man
knows, or whether it will strike by
direct invasion at all. We know that
attack is possible—and that is enough.
So now, as always before, Ameri
cans have sprung to action. Today's
Ethan Aliens are gathering together
their Green Mountain Boys in train

ing camp, machine shop, and flying
field. Today's Israel Putnams have
left their plows standing in the fur
row, scrapped their plans for making
the peaceful machines of work and
play, put their factories and their
brains at their country's command.
► Today, if Knudsen and Stettinius,
Stimson and Knox had time for such
thoughts, they would know how
George Washington felt when he took
command at Cambridge. The same
swarm of eager civilian volunteers,
no two alike in equipment and train
ing, but all anxious, devoted, impa
tient. Across the desks of the defense
chiefs flows a steady stream of letters,
thousands of them, all of the same
tenor. "I'm ready. Put me to work.''
The Paul Reveres of the American

press have done their work well. Now
they are riding out again with other
messages — just as important. Mes
sages of courage . . . and patience . . .
and hope.
► For we too have our fainthearts
who are ready to quit when the out
posts are taken. We have our near
sighted who imagine that they would
rather lose their liberties than their
comforts, and don't see that they
stand to lose both.
We have our cynics, young and old.
who suppose that all wars are futile
because the results of the last one
were thrown away. We have our
warped and embittered — our poten
tial Charles Lees and Benedict
Arnolds.
All of us need protection from the

defeatism that seeps from such
sources. We need our own uncertain
ties and fears cleared up. We need our
spirits heartened about what we have
done, can do. and are now doing.
► This protection, this enlighten
ment. this encouragement, the press is
supplying now every day. Day after
day. our newspapers are bringing us
news of plans completed at Washing
ton in weeks, whose details in normal
times would have consumed years.
Soon they will tell us of raw-material
problems solved, of factories and
mills swinging into stream-lined pro
duction, of rapid organization and
training of our man power.
We have asked for miracles and we
are getting them. But the press will
remind us that even Aladdin's palace
took a night to build.
In this planning stage, when all
roads lead to Washington, the metro
politan newspapers and wire services
have increased or reassigned their
staffs in the Capital.
► They are covering stories so big,
developments so rapid, that even the
early days of the New Deal seem
quiet in retrospect. Economic rela
tions of the Americas, history-making
moves of the State Department, ex
pansion of Army and Navy on a scale
never seen in this hemisphere, sensa
tional industrial decisions affecting
hundreds of centers from Hartford to
Southern California . . . the situation
is the greatest challenge to energy, in-

This is one of a series of advertisements in which the Editors of TIME hopt tc
give readers of TIME a clearer picture of the world of news-gathering, news
writing. and news-reading and the part TIME plays in helping you to grasp
measure, and use the history of your lifetime as you live the story of vour life

genuity. and vision that this genera
tion of newspapermen has ever met.
Because the question of security
for our country is today's No. 1 prob
lem, TIME, the Weekly Newsmaga
zine. has decided to establish a new
department, to be devoted exclusively
to the progress of National Defense.
Here, in one place, the anxious citi
zen will find reports from every field
—government, management, materi
als. factories, shipyards, man power,
training schools, public opinion —
every detail in the current picture of
the nation's defense effort, time's
much-discussed summaries, which
have been so widely quoted in recent
weeks, give some idea of the com
pleteness and grasp with which this
vital news will be handled.
► As the circles widen out from Wash
ington. TIME S fact-finders and trend
observers will be ready and waiting
wherever the ripples roll in. If things
go wrong, bog down in personalities,
get tangled in red tape, time will say
so. If things go as well or better than
can humanly be expected, TIME will
say that too.
TIME, along with all loyal Ameri
cans. believes that an intelligent, in
formed. single-minded citizenry can
and will build a strong defense a de
fense so strong, so dynamic, and so ef
ficient. that no power on earth will lie
able to attack or challenge the vital
interests of the American people.
