► Outwardly, perhaps, the Conven
tions of 1940 may seem the same as
those of less portentous years. Again
we shall hear the thrilling Roll Call
of the States the beautiful and so
norous names, Spanish and English,
Indian and French, whose alphabeti
cal march takes the listener s mind
on tremendous, exhilarating leaps
across the map. Again there will be
blaring bands, flamboyant oratory,
hour-long demonstrations.
But underneath the surface bed
lam. there will be sober recognition

that more than political issues are at
stake; that picking the Right Man
means picking the Right Man for the
country, not just for the Party. The
man who is signed on as captain faces
little likelihood of a calm passage
over glassy seas: the barometer has
already dropped and may go still
lower.
► Even the dullest delegate will ap
proach his job this year with a feeling
of grave responsibility. And that feel
ing will be shared by the men and
women massed in the / 00 seats occu
pied by the representatives of Amer
ica's newspapers.
There in the midst of the oratory
and the cheering, with bands boom
ing and flash bulbs flaring ... in the
thick of events, complicated, turbu
lent. and historic . . . these men and
women will perform the job that the
U. S. demands of its journalists.
Every one of them will do his part
to show us the real scene beneath
the carnival. Every one of them will
know that he is reporting the first
steps in the democratic process of
disagree, compromise, and unite . . .
knows that it is the two-party sys
tem which makes possible majority
rule, and that majority rule is the

esscnce of true democracy
► The newsmen on the floor, in the
committee rooms, watching candi
dates' hideaways, or spreading their
ears to the breeze of rumor in the
lobbies are there, not to represent a
party, but to represent us. the Amer
ican public.
"Eternal vigilance is the price of
liberty." Without the press in these
still-free United States, we could not
exercise that vigilance however much
we tried. We cannot be alert to the
dangers or benefits of a situation un
less we understand it and the men
and events that brought it about.
► Making men and events clearer
and more vivid is the special job of
the Weekly Newsmagazine. For many
months. TIME readers have had the
background of these dramas soon to
be enacted in Philadelphia and Ch.-
cago. Names that are just names to
many voters are real people to TIME
readers. Events that seem surprising
to casual headline-samplers are often
predictable.
The TIME reader knows how his
countrv runs itself, and knows that he
knows it. As a citizen, he can pull his
weight in the boat. Now. as never lie
fore. the boat needs it.

This is one of a series of advertisements in which the Editors of TIME hope to
give readers of time a clearer picture of the world of news-gathering, news
writing. and news-reading and the part TIME plays in helping you to grasp,
measure, and use the history of your lifetime as you live the story of youi lite.
