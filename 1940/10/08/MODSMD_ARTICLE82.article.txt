How many times such words have
reverberated through the Party Con
vention halls of America—over bowed
heads secretly busy with large ambi
tions and little intrigues—hearing the
old words only as a hungry boy hears
his father's grace before meals.
Next week in Philadelphia next
month in Chicago—will there be one
heart so calculating or so shallow that

it does not lift up into the throat with
that prayer?
► We must go back to the summer of
1864 to find political conventions like
these . . . the summer when Grant
and Lee fought it out, and the gray
and the blue lay in windrows at Spott
sylvania and the Wilderness.
1916 was not like this. There was
war in Europe—but oceans were still
oceans and no American felt that dan
ger was on our doorstep.
What were we so excited about
back in '96? "You shall not crucifv

mankind upon a cross of gold!" We
were arguing about what metal our
money should be made of.
What were the Bull Moose doing
in 1912? "We stand at Armageddon
and we battle for the Lord!" They
were saving us from William Howard
Taft and the Payne-Aldrich tariff bill.
Strange things we Americans have
quarreled over. . . in the light of this
hour, when mankind is being cruci
fied upon the hook-armed cross, and
Armageddon flares into world-wide
fury.

August, 1940, the men and women

For the Lincoln Memorial is Amer

under the spell of a personality so
great that its living presence can al
most be felt, Americans are re-reading
words as luminous today as in that
other day when the nation was so
gravely endangered.
"It is for us. the living, rather, to
be here dedicated to that unfinished
work ... to the great task remaining
before us . . . that this nation, under
God. shall have a new birth of free

glad to do something at a time like
this!"
"Just the same—l can't bear to think

What were the Bull Moose doing

gravely endangered.
