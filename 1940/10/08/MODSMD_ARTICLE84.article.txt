# The 						90 million Americans who may
## 
### 
SOUTH of the isthmus of Panama,
like a fat pear hanging upside
down from a slender stem, lies a con
tinent inhabited by 90 million people
—South Americans who may have to
work for Hitler.
Already the conqueror is reaching
greedily for the South American pear.
Already the Nazi advance agents
crawl over it like beetles . . . searching
out the soft spots...nibbling at morale
. . . burrowing tunnels underneath the
surface.
► Whether these moves by Nazi Ger
many mean Blitzkrieg or Handels
krieg—military thrust or trade war—
they promise to put Uncle Sam on
perhaps the hottest spot of his career.
For although the Americas have,
of late years, given the "Good neigh
bor" idea more than lip-service, they
rre off to a late start. The two con
tinents in this hemisphere have, for
canturies, drawn their oceans about
;hem like blankets . . . have had for
each other that distrust which has its
roots in ignorance.
Now, with the clock of Europe strik
ing the eleventh hour, once again it
appears that ignorance—like crime
does not pay.
► Colombia, with its two-ocean sea
coast . . . Venezuela, teeming with oil
. . . Ecuador, whose Galapagos Islands
command the Southern approach to
the Panama Canal . . . Bolivia, which
may have to become sole U. S. source
of tin . . . Argentina, Europe's poten
tial breadbasket... Brazil, bigger than
the 48 United States and four-fifths as
large as Europe ...
Through no act of its own, every
one of these nations has, overnight,
become a potential powder keg under
Uncle Sam. With the U. S. still unpre
pared, with a two-ocean Navy four to
six years away, there is good reason

for furrowed brows in Washington.
Should we give up hope? Watch the
South American stars drawn into the
Nazi constellation? See our trade ar
teries severed and our life blood
drained away?
No. For, in addition to the moves
J
being made in Washington, there exist
forces which can help thwart the Nazi
pull of gravity. These forces are the
newspapers of both continents.
South and Central America have
about 750 papers—a good share of
which practice top-flight journalism.
► Peru's El Comercio— 101-year-old
daily ...Chile's El Mercurio—founded
m/
in 182 7. . . Argentina's La Nation, La
Critica, and the great La Prensa, one
of the most influential newspapers in
the world . . . Brazil's Portuguese-lan
guage Corre/o da Manha . . . are news
papers of which any nation could be
proud.
And since the Nazi hordes poured
into Holland, South American papers
have stepped up their U. S. news. The
Brazilian or Argentine newsreader
can now discuss the Third Term issue
as intelligently as he can the Havana
conference. Even U. S. comic strips
are a daily feature. Popeye the Sailor
caused a near-crisis in the spinach
market.
► But what's true south of the isth
mus is less true north of it. The aver
age U. S. newsreader, business man,
industrialist, knows less about Buenos
Aires or Rio, than he know T s about
Berlin or Battle Creek. But he wants
to know more! The U. S. press is now
recognizing that it is faced with a tre
mendous challenge—the discovery of
South America.
There are signs that progressive
papers, large and small, are accepting
this challenge. Crack correspondents
—men like William Simms of Scripps-

Howard; Walter B. Kerr Jr., of the
N. Y. Herald Tribune, and Wayne
Thomis of the Chicago Tribune, have
been—or soon will be—filing stories
direct from the trouble spots. Through
out the country, AP and UP South
American dispatches are finding their
way into print, instead of into Edi
tors' wastebaskets.
► And the Weekly Newsmagazine, as
the national U. S. newspaper, is in the
forefront of this march of enlighten
ment.
Staff correspondents, researchers,
and photographers for the entire time
family—time, life, FORTUNE, and the
march OF time movie —have all
helped to build up a remarkable res
ervoir of South American facts, con
tacts, and first-hand experience.

has fewer axes to grind, fewer oxen to
be gored. And very few men, even in
public office, have deeper responsi
bilities to the people.
Together with time's own Washing
ton staff of eleven, these men supply
the rich harvest of news from which
the Newsmagazine extracts the most
significant kernels.
Because the Presidency is the hub
around which the nation revolves,
TIME has always accorded lead-off po
sition to what is virtually a diary for
the President. No week of his life is
unimportant, and TIME readers al
ways know what he has done with it.
And they know,too,every noteworthy
event in the other departments of
the government, for the Presiden
tial "diary" is followed by a review of
all Washington during a week of the
nation's political history.
► One integrated, dramatic story...
this is what TIME creates out of the
two million words that pour forth
from the city by the Potomac each
week. Every piece of vital news is fit-

ted into every other piece . . . out of
the week's haze of details emerges a
clear, consistent, meaningful picture.
Democratic government will sur
vive in this unfriendly world if the
electorate knows and cares what its
public servants are doing . . . faces its
democratic decisions with an informed
understanding.TlME takes the respon
sibility for seeing that a most influen
tial section of the electorate knows,
cares, and understands.
