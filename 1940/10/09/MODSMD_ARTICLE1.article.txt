### BOB LOW 
ROOSEVELT, 31-year
old son of the President, has vol
unteered for a year's service in the
Specialists' Reserve of the United
States Army Air Corps. With the
announcement that Elliott would
serve his training period as a cap
tain in a non-flying capacity, groups
all over the country took up the
ciy, "politics."
Unwilling to miss a chance to get
its name in the newspapers of the
country, the Palo Aito Junior
Chamber of Commerce got on what
at first looked like a band-wagon.
To Elliott, the group sent a tele
gram urging him to resign his post
in order to "restore public confi
dence" in the draft and to save it
from a "disastrous beginning." The
President's son, the message clearly
suggested, had secured a soft job
with good pay through political pull
to avoid the possibility of being
drafted.

ROOSEVELT, 31-year
old son of the President, has vol
unteered for a year's service in the
Specialists' Reserve of the United
States Army Air Corps. With the
announcement that Elliott would
serve his training period as a cap
tain in a non-flying capacity, groups
all over the country took up the
ciy, "politics."
Unwilling to miss a chance to get
its name in the newspapers of the
country, the Palo Aito Junior
Chamber of Commerce got on what
at first looked like a band-wagon.
To Elliott, the group sent a tele
gram urging him to resign his post
in order to "restore public confi
dence" in the draft and to save it
from a "disastrous beginning." The
President's son, the message clearly
suggested, had secured a soft job
with good pay through political pull
to avoid the possibility of being
drafted.
