## 
### M. J. MONTGOMERY 
K Overriding Cardinals proposed on-campus dance Big Game night, Ex
jfcommittce last night made five recommendations to Cardinals.
; Excom favored a semi-formal, off-campus, low priced dance, and sug
gested a band of the Freddy Nagel class and refreshments on the punch-

and-cookics scale.
PEACE DAY: A, peace day com
mittee will be appointed. Conclusive
action, however, was postponed,
since the committee recognizes that
world conditions change not only the
significance of the event, but the
possibility of securing an appro
priate speaker.
Dr. Wilbur, conferring with a stu
dent committee last week, warned
against talking peace "in a world in
which there is no peace"; and sug
gested that the peace day program
be continued, but renamed. He also
called attention to subversive groups
sponsoring peace movements else
where.
"I don't think Stanford has any
subversive groups," said Dwight
Hutchinson, in support of his motion
to appoint a Peace Day committee.
"Peace is not un-American," he
concluded.
DRIVES: Approval of the Red
Cross Drive, Nov. 4-8, reopened the
question of correlating all campus
drives in a kind of community chest
for all campus charities.
Ex Committee appointed three fac
ulty members last spring to a com
mittee for this purpose. John Porter,
Pat Adams, and Dwight Hutchinson
were asked last night to join this
group. Should they decide to re
ject plans for the Red Cross Drive,
Ex Committee's appraval will be
cancelled.
Okay of the Stanford Family Call
committee was postponed pending
the appointment of junior mem
bers.

besky was voted an apology by Ex

night that there would be an inves
tigation of the matter.

Union's room 15 last night. The

noon Quad proofs will be distrib

made for the beginning and end of
quarters when the book exchange
business is heaviest.
APPOINTMENTS: Muriel Boggs
was named to revise the A.S.S.U.
constitution and by-laws, and to
