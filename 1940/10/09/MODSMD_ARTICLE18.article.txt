# Smith Believes Japan Unable To Take China
## Stanford Graduate Tells of Burma Road At Tuesday Series 
### 
"I think it is highly improbable
that the Japanese will take China,
especially the Burma Road," com
mented Nicol Smith, Stanford
graduate, in a brief interview
before his illustrated lecture on
the Burma Road last night for
the Tuesday Evening Series.
"The Japanese bombings to date
have not proved particularly effec
tive because they have not been
followed up by troop movemer*' - "
he added. "It would be practi
impossible to bomb the road De
cause of the difficulty in reaching it.
The two most vulnerable spots are
bridges located in canyons much
narrower than the Grand Canyon.
These positions are also heavily
fortified.
SUPPLY BASES
"The Japanese are farther from
their supply bases than the Ger
mans are from England, which
makes their attack far more difficult.
"People of the world seem so
concerned about the opening and
closing of the road," he continued,
"but they must remember that God
closes it for three months every
year during the rainy season."
WORK OF COOLIES
Smith showed pictures from the
beginning of the road at Yunnan-fu
to its eastern extremity at the Bur
ma border. He told of the remark
able work done by coolies over one
part of the road. No European tools
were available; so thousands of
men had to sit patiently for hours
knocking rocks together to make
gravel.
"Part of the road is as good as
Highway 101, while other parts arc
as difficult to travel as the wildest
mountain pass in this country," he
commented.
MOVIES SHOWN
Motion pictures of natives, their
queer customs and homes, added a
personal touch to the lecture. Many
beautiful slides of temples and
buildings in far-off villages showed
how people in that seldom-visited
part of the world live.
Smith told interesting stories fhat
he had heard or had happen to him.
He explained how little concerned
the Chinese are over the continual
bombing raids of the Japanese when
he quoted a native, "These Japa
nese are very good. They just dig
another irrigation ditch."
Smith's movies are the only ones
ever taken of the entire Burma
Road, and the lecture last night was
his first in a series that will include
24 talks on the Pacific Coast and 60
more to be given in the East.
WRITES- BEST SELLER
His book, "Burma Road," is a
best seller. Smith plans a sequel
to be completed in December. His
next trip will take him to French
Guiana, then to Tibet.
Commenting on his present book,
he said, "I expected to sell about
1500 copies of 'Burma Road,' but it
is now in its fourth edition. A book
today based on lecture material
should have news appeal, and the
"Burma Road" certainly is not lack
ing in that quality.
"I v/ould rather show motion pic
tures at Stanford than any other
place I have been. The conditions
are perfect," he concluded with the
broad smile which has won him so
many friends all over the world.

beautiful slides of temples and
buildings in far-off villages showed
how people in that seldom-visited
part of the world live.
Smith told interesting stories fhat
he had heard or had happen to him.
He explained how little concerned
the Chinese are over the continual
bombing raids of the Japanese when
he quoted a native, "These Japa
nese are very good. They just dig
another irrigation ditch."
Smith's movies are the only ones
ever taken of the entire Burma
Road, and the lecture last night was
his first in a series that will include
24 talks on the Pacific Coast and 60
more to be given in the East.
WRITES- BEST SELLER
His book, "Burma Road," is a
best seller. Smith plans a sequel
to be completed in December. His
next trip will take him to French
Guiana, then to Tibet.
Commenting on his present book,
he said, "I expected to sell about
1500 copies of 'Burma Road,' but it
is now in its fourth edition. A book
today based on lecture material
should have news appeal, and the
"Burma Road" certainly is not lack
ing in that quality.
"I v/ould rather show motion pic
tures at Stanford than any other
place I have been. The conditions
are perfect," he concluded with the
broad smile which has won him so
many friends all over the world.
"I think it is highly improbable
that the Japanese will take China,
especially the Burma Road," com
mented Nicol Smith, Stanford
graduate, in a brief interview
before his illustrated lecture on
the Burma Road last night for
the Tuesday Evening Series.
"The Japanese bombings to date
have not proved particularly effec
tive because they have not been
followed up by troop movemer*' - "
he added. "It would be practi
impossible to bomb the road De
cause of the difficulty in reaching it.
The two most vulnerable spots are
bridges located in canyons much
narrower than the Grand Canyon.
These positions are also heavily
fortified.
SUPPLY BASES
"The Japanese are farther from
their supply bases than the Ger
mans are from England, which
makes their attack far more difficult.
"People of the world seem so
concerned about the opening and
closing of the road," he continued,
"but they must remember that God
closes it for three months every
year during the rainy season."
WORK OF COOLIES
Smith showed pictures from the
beginning of the road at Yunnan-fu
to its eastern extremity at the Bur
ma border. He told of the remark
able work done by coolies over one
part of the road. No European tools
were available; so thousands of
men had to sit patiently for hours
knocking rocks together to make
gravel.
"Part of the road is as good as
Highway 101, while other parts arc
as difficult to travel as the wildest
mountain pass in this country," he
commented.
MOVIES SHOWN
Motion pictures of natives, their
queer customs and homes, added a
personal touch to the lecture. Many
beautiful slides of temples and
buildings in far-off villages showed
how people in that seldom-visited
part of the world live.
Smith told interesting stories fhat
