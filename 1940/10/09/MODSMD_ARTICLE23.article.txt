# Corn Flake Blizzard Hits Paly Screen in 'Untamed'
## 
### 
''UNTAMED," now playing at the Varsity Theater.
The latest corn flake blizzard that Hollywood has turned out is entitled
"Untamed." In this epic of life and love in the mountain fastness of
Alaska, the gullible public is treated to the standard story of the unhappy
marriage that culminates with the husband heroically passing out of the

picture instead of standing in the,
way of his wife's happiness.
Kay Milland plays the part of the
rum-soaked society doctor who
must take a vacation in order to
get it out of his system. He decides
to take a hunting trip and arrives
in Alaska, where he meets the lus
cious Patricia Morison, the wife of
his guide. Of course, it is love at
first sight, and the matter is not
helped any by the malicious gossips
of the village.
Mrs. Morison gets rather annoyed
at these cats and when she sees
them spying on her with field glass
es, she ups and takes a shot at them
with an air rifle.
WHEN WINTER COMES
Meanwhile winter is fast setting in,
and with it comes an epidemic.
Added to this misfortune, the old
village doctor passes away. So Mil
land steps in and takes charge. As
time passes it becomes more and
more apparent that the only way ]
they can save the village is to get j
the serum which is miles away. The !
person sent for it perishes in the I
terrific blizzard that has suddenly
come up.
Milland starts out for it; the girl
.starts out for it a little later, and !
.still later the girl's husband starts
after them who, he thinks, are elop
ing, since the gossip has finally j
reached his ears.
IN A HUDDLE
However, he finds them huddled
together half frozen, but they have
the serum, which of course alle
viates any suspicion of dishonor. He
sends them off with the serum while |
he mushes on alone, conveniently
freezing off just before he gets home.
Akim Tamiroff does a splendid job

as the voluble French guide and the
others are adequate in the rather
stereotyped roles they play. The
second picture is Ann Sothern in
another "Maisie" characterization.
This time she invades the gold fields.
These are always peppy pictures and
deserve better treatment than they
get.—Wuenschel

This time she invades the gold fields.
These are always peppy pictures and
deserve better treatment than they
get.—Wuenschel
''UNTAMED," now playing at the Varsity Theater.
The latest corn flake blizzard that Hollywood has turned out is entitled
"Untamed." In this epic of life and love in the mountain fastness of
Alaska, the gullible public is treated to the standard story of the unhappy
marriage that culminates with the husband heroically passing out of the

picture instead of standing in the,
way of his wife's happiness.
Kay Milland plays the part of the
rum-soaked society doctor who
must take a vacation in order to
get it out of his system. He decides
to take a hunting trip and arrives
in Alaska, where he meets the lus
cious Patricia Morison, the wife of
his guide. Of course, it is love at
first sight, and the matter is not
helped any by the malicious gossips
of the village.
Mrs. Morison gets rather annoyed
at these cats and when she sees
them spying on her with field glass
es, she ups and takes a shot at them
with an air rifle.
WHEN WINTER COMES
Meanwhile winter is fast setting in,
and with it comes an epidemic.
Added to this misfortune, the old
village doctor passes away. So Mil
land steps in and takes charge. As
time passes it becomes more and
more apparent that the only way ]
they can save the village is to get j
the serum which is miles away. The !
person sent for it perishes in the I
terrific blizzard that has suddenly
come up.
Milland starts out for it; the girl
.starts out for it a little later, and !
.still later the girl's husband starts
after them who, he thinks, are elop
ing, since the gossip has finally j
reached his ears.
IN A HUDDLE
However, he finds them huddled
together half frozen, but they have
the serum, which of course alle
viates any suspicion of dishonor. He
sends them off with the serum while |
he mushes on alone, conveniently
freezing off just before he gets home.
Akim Tamiroff does a splendid job

as the voluble French guide and the
others are adequate in the rather
stereotyped roles they play. The
second picture is Ann Sothern in
another "Maisie" characterization.
