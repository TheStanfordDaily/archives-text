TOKYO, Oct. 8 CUP). â€”British
Ambassador Sir Robert Craigie in
formed Foi-eign Minister Yosuke
Matsuoka today Britain would re
open the Burma route to China
Oct. 17, an act which Japan has said
would be regarded as a "challenge"
to her military alliance with Ger
many and Italy.
Domei, official Japanese news
agency, charged the British decision
to reopen General Chiang Kai
shek's main route for war supplies
was "the result of Chinese-Ameri
can maneuvers."
Japan repeatedly in recent days
has announced her intention to op
pose any nation giving aid to the
Chinese Nationalist government.
A Berlin report to the Tokyo
newspaper Nichi Nichi said ac
cording to advices from The Hague,
Britain was forcing Holland's exiled
Queen Wilhelmina to cede Dutch
overseas naval and air bases to the
United States in an effort to wiri
American favor.
Nichi Nichi said Britain was
scheming to cut Japan off from the
Dutch East Indies, drive Germany,
Italy and Japan into economic diffi
culties and accelerate America's
participation in the war in order
to force Japan into two-phase op
erations.
