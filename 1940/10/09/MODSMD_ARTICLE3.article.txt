# U.S. Urges Americans Leave China
## Fear of Crisis Over Burma Road Opening On Oct. 17 by British 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 8 (UP).â€”
The United States government
urged more than 16,000 Americans
to leave the Far East today coinci
dent with the disclosure Great
Britain fears a "general crisis" in
that area after Oct. 17 when the
Burma Road to China is reopened.
The Department of Agriculture
moved to curtail shipments of
American wheat to China ports
now under Japanese control, and the
State Department indicated consid
eration might be given to whether
1600 U. S. marines should be with
drawn from Shanghai.
CONFERENCE TODAY
These developments came amid
signs President Roosevelt and his ad
visers are giving serious attention to
the Far Eastern situation. It was
reviewed generally at a conference
early in the day between Secretary
of State Cordell Hull and Japanese
Ambassador Kensuke Horinouchi.
The meeting was sought by the am
bassador, who said the talk had been
friendly.
This nation's problems in the Pa
cific subsequently were examined at
a two-hour luncheon conference
among the President, Admiral James
O. Richardson, commander of the
United States fleet, and Admiral
William D. Leahy, retired former
chief of naval operations and now
governor of Puerto Rico.
FLEET ON PACIFIC
Disposition of the major part of
the U. S. fleet has been a subject of
speculation since tension in the Pa
cific was heightened by Japan's
entry into a military alliance with
Rome and Berlin. Two-thirds of the
fleet now is based at Hawaii, while
the remainder has returned to the
Pacific Coast.
Richardson said he reported on the
readiness of the fleet and told im
porters the segment of the fleet now
in California would take back to
Hawaii "several thousand men who
are badly needed."
To an inquiry whether the fleet is
ready, Richardson said:
"It is not as ready as it will be."
Strict secrecy surrounded the sus
pension of subsidies on shipment of
American wheat from Pacific Coast
ports to Hong Kong and China. Ag
riculture Department officials said
the action was taken after confer
ences with State Department author
ities but would give no explanation.
WHEAT EXPORTS
Department officials estimated ap
proximately 10.000,000 bushels of
wheat and flour have been exported
to Far Eastern ports since Jan. 1
under the subsidy program.
The effect of the order would be
to prevent Japan from getting
American wheat at a price below
the world market level. The sub
sidy originally was voted to encour
age exports of American surpluses.
Experts said Japan still could ob
tain American wheat and flour on
which no subsidies are paid.
