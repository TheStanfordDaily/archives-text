## 
### BUD AMES 
(Exclusive Interview to The Daily)
Stanford men certainly get around—or the story of "From Stanford to
the Thoroughbred Stable."
The story began back in 1921, when Lin Howard, son of Charles "Sea
biscuit" Howard left Stanford. Five years ago. Lin became interested in
horse racing, and when the opportunity came to train horses with crooner

>Bing Crosby, he jumped at the
I chance.
FAVORS FRATERNITIES
"Yes, I'm in favor of fraternities,"
|he commented. "I think they have
done many things for Stanford. I
came to Stanford because most of
my friends were here."
The remainder of Lin's time was
spent in playing football, track, and
some baseball.
"And I didn't spend any of my
college time around horses," he
added firmly. "In fact, I didn't spend
any time at the tracks until about
three or four years ago."
MEETS BING CROSBY
Of horses—his life—Lin had more
to say. About seven years ago he
met Bing Crosby through friends.
Their friendship grew after they be
gan attending a few football games
together. Training was the next
step.
"All the horses I train must be
jood," he said. "The ones that
aren't don't stay in my barn very
long. The best horse I ever trained
was Ligaroti, 'cause he won us some
very good bets, plus around 30 thou
sand in purses."
lIOBBY IS FOOTBALL
He raises horses, but his hobby is
football.
"About Stanford, I can say that I
had a lot of fun and I met some
darn nice kids," he concluded. "My
favorite professor was Professor
Martin. Well, I hope you have a
good football team, and can take
U.S.C."
