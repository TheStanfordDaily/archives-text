# 'Reds' Win Championship
## Ripple Scores Winning Tally In Hectic 7th 
### 
CINCINNATI. Oct. 8 (UP). —
'Hie Cincinnati Reds traveled the
last long mile down baseball's
highway today and found the
rainbow's end pot-of-gold as the
shadows crept over Crosley Field.
Afler 21 years the Reds won their
second World's Championship by
conquering the Detroit Tigers 2-1, in
a dramatic seventh game which saw
big Paul Derringer triumph over
swashbuckling Bobo Newsom.
A freckle-faced, red-headed, ex
house painter from Export, Pa., who
was playing ball in the minors six
weeks ago scored the run which
brought the Reds their first baseball
title since the scandal-tainted Black
Sox series of 1919.
RIPPLE SCORES
Jimmy Ripple, plucked off the
Montreal International League club
by the Reds just ahead of the World
Series deadline, crossed the plate
with the winning run in a riotous

seventh inning which lifted the 26,—
769 tans in Crosley Field from the
depths of despair to heights of joy.
The Reds' triumph, four games to
three, gave the National League its
first world championship since
Frankie Frisch's gas house gang from
St. Louis upset these same Tigers
under almost identical circumstances
in 1934.
Bill McKechnie's club won the
world's title just as it won the Na
tional League pennant by the one
run margin system. During the sea
son the Reds won 41 of their 100
games by one run. Today the Reds
rolled the winning number once
more by that slim margin of one
run.
PITCHING DUEL
From the first pitch to the last out,
today's game was a right-handed
pitching struggle between Paul Der
ringer, the Reds' 34-year-old control
artist, and Bobo Newsom, the Tigers'
32-year-old speedball ace. It was a
battle of nerves between Derringer,
pitching with two days' rest, and
Newsom, hurling with only one
day's surcease from the firing line.
Derirnger allowed seven hits, only
three of which went out of the in
field. and the lone run made off him
was unearned. Newsom also gave u 1 "
seven hits, four of which car"-* ,n
the last three innings. Ol' Bo v , who
twice had licked the Reds, answered
the call to battle today and was an
admirable workman out there on
the mound until the fatal seventh.
Derringer, in winning his second
game of the series, got better as the
battle progressed. His only serious
trouble was in the early innings. In
the last five innings the Tigers got
only four men on base, two on hits,
one on a walk and one on a force
out.
Newsom fanned six Reds and
walked one, Lombardi intentionally,
and had the Reds virtually at his
mercy except in one inning, the sev
enth, in which all the damage oc
curred.

Newsom, hurling with only one
day's surcease from the firing line.
Derirnger allowed seven hits, only
three of which went out of the in
field. and the lone run made off him
was unearned. Newsom also gave u 1 "
seven hits, four of which car"-* ,n
the last three innings. Ol' Bo v , who
twice had licked the Reds, answered
the call to battle today and was an
admirable workman out there on
the mound until the fatal seventh.
Derringer, in winning his second
game of the series, got better as the
battle progressed. His only serious
trouble was in the early innings. In
the last five innings the Tigers got
only four men on base, two on hits,
one on a walk and one on a force
out.
Newsom fanned six Reds and
walked one, Lombardi intentionally,
and had the Reds virtually at his
mercy except in one inning, the sev

curred.
CINCINNATI. Oct. 8 (UP). —
'Hie Cincinnati Reds traveled the
last long mile down baseball's
highway today and found the
rainbow's end pot-of-gold as the
shadows crept over Crosley Field.
Afler 21 years the Reds won their
second World's Championship by
conquering the Detroit Tigers 2-1, in
a dramatic seventh game which saw
big Paul Derringer triumph over
swashbuckling Bobo Newsom.
A freckle-faced, red-headed, ex
house painter from Export, Pa., who
was playing ball in the minors six
weeks ago scored the run which
brought the Reds their first baseball
title since the scandal-tainted Black
Sox series of 1919.
RIPPLE SCORES
Jimmy Ripple, plucked off the
Montreal International League club
by the Reds just ahead of the World
Series deadline, crossed the plate
with the winning run in a riotous

seventh inning which lifted the 26,—
769 tans in Crosley Field from the
depths of despair to heights of joy.
The Reds' triumph, four games to
three, gave the National League its
first world championship since
Frankie Frisch's gas house gang from
St. Louis upset these same Tigers
under almost identical circumstances
in 1934.
Bill McKechnie's club won the
world's title just as it won the Na
tional League pennant by the one
run margin system. During the sea
son the Reds won 41 of their 100
games by one run. Today the Reds
rolled the winning number once
more by that slim margin of one
run.
PITCHING DUEL
From the first pitch to the last out,
today's game was a right-handed
pitching struggle between Paul Der
ringer, the Reds' 34-year-old control
artist, and Bobo Newsom, the Tigers'
32-year-old speedball ace. It was a
battle of nerves between Derringer,
pitching with two days' rest, and
Newsom, hurling with only one
day's surcease from the firing line.
Derirnger allowed seven hits, only
three of which went out of the in
field. and the lone run made off him
