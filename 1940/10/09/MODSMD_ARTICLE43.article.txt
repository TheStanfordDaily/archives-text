(While Sports Editor Jerry
Brucker takes a day off. Don Sol by
takes over Slants to toll you a hit
about the frosh football team and
its coach.—The Editor)
TIARRY SHIPKEY is quite a
coach.
Since he joined the Cardinal
coaching staff in the fall of 1936,
Shipkoy has turned in one of the
best coaching records in the school.
Of the 20 games his freshman
football teams have competed in
since that year, they have come
out on top in 19 of them. Not
had! Not bad at all!
In the fall of '36 Harry had his
wor V year, his team losing three
•nes. Although Norm Standlee
played fullback for the Papoose
team the next year, Harry's luck
was little better, and his team once
again dropped a trio of games. But
they won three also.
Then came 1938 and Frankie Al
bert and Co.: and the frosh gridders
went through an undefeated season
as Albert passed the opposition
dizzy. And the '39 yearling grid
ders, with A1 Cole at the helm, kept
up the perfect record until they
dropped a heart-breaking 13-12
game to the U.S.C. Trobabes. That
was the only loss of the six games
played last fall.
Last Saturday the beginning was
written to another chapter of the
success story of Harry Shipkey as
his newest freshman outfit ran over
San Mateo Junior College. 2 1 -0. Too
bad Jim Ellis, who booted three for
three on conversion attempts last
Saturday, wasn't around to help the
'39 frosh against the Trobabes.
* *
W/LIEN Stanford's freshman foot
ball team hops the train for
Southland Friday night, there will
be 33 players aboard. This is evi
dence that the day is gone when 11
picked men played the entire game
if they were able to stand up that
long for, although Shipkey may not
use all his players, he is certain to
use a goodly number of them.
As a matter of fact, the husky
frosh mentor is having quite a bit
of difficulty this early in the week
trying to determine who his best
men are and how ho can get them
all in the game at the same time.
For instance, although it is evi
dent that Loren LaPrade is the top
pivot man on the squad, there are
three other centers who are having
a nip and tuck battle for the second
string berth. They are Tyler Nor
ton. Frank Heid, and Bill Hutchin
son. And even Shipkoy hasn't made
up his mind as to who is the best
of the three.
Then, too. Shipkey can't quite de
cide whether Johnny Kenward
should be in front of Jack Reynolds
at the quarterback spot or whether
it should be vice-versa. Reynolds,

incidentally, is the son of Big Jim
Reynolds, well-known Stanford
alumnus and former Indian crew
man.
the current crop of year
ling footballers there seems to
be quite a few boys with lots of po
tentialities. Certainly included in
this category are Loren LaPrade,
Jean Lamoure, and Jim Ellis in the
line, and Bob Koch and Randall
Fawcett in the backfield.
If someone were to give pens or
shoes or hats or things to outstand
ing players on the frosh eleven
from Saturday to Saturday, LaPrade
certainly would have received some
thing or other for his sterling per
formance against the San Mateans
last week-end.

TIARRY SHIPKEY is quite a
coach.
Since he joined the Cardinal
coaching staff in the fall of 1936,
Shipkoy has turned in one of the
best coaching records in the school.
Of the 20 games his freshman
football teams have competed in
since that year, they have come
out on top in 19 of them. Not
had! Not bad at all!
In the fall of '36 Harry had his
wor V year, his team losing three
•nes. Although Norm Standlee
played fullback for the Papoose
team the next year, Harry's luck
was little better, and his team once
again dropped a trio of games. But
they won three also.
Then came 1938 and Frankie Al
bert and Co.: and the frosh gridders
went through an undefeated season
as Albert passed the opposition
dizzy. And the '39 yearling grid
ders, with A1 Cole at the helm, kept
up the perfect record until they
dropped a heart-breaking 13-12
game to the U.S.C. Trobabes. That
was the only loss of the six games
played last fall.
Last Saturday the beginning was
written to another chapter of the
success story of Harry Shipkey as
his newest freshman outfit ran over
San Mateo Junior College. 2 1 -0. Too
bad Jim Ellis, who booted three for
three on conversion attempts last
Saturday, wasn't around to help the
'39 frosh against the Trobabes.

W/LIEN Stanford's freshman foot
ball team hops the train for
Southland Friday night, there will
be 33 players aboard. This is evi
dence that the day is gone when 11
picked men played the entire game
if they were able to stand up that
long for, although Shipkey may not
use all his players, he is certain to
use a goodly number of them.
As a matter of fact, the husky
frosh mentor is having quite a bit
of difficulty this early in the week
trying to determine who his best
men are and how ho can get them
all in the game at the same time.
For instance, although it is evi
dent that Loren LaPrade is the top
pivot man on the squad, there are
three other centers who are having
a nip and tuck battle for the second
string berth. They are Tyler Nor
ton. Frank Heid, and Bill Hutchin
son. And even Shipkoy hasn't made
up his mind as to who is the best
of the three.
Then, too. Shipkey can't quite de
cide whether Johnny Kenward
should be in front of Jack Reynolds
at the quarterback spot or whether
it should be vice-versa. Reynolds,

incidentally, is the son of Big Jim
Reynolds, well-known Stanford
alumnus and former Indian crew
man.
the current crop of year
ling footballers there seems to
be quite a few boys with lots of po
tentialities. Certainly included in
this category are Loren LaPrade,
Jean Lamoure, and Jim Ellis in the
line, and Bob Koch and Randall
Fawcett in the backfield.

shoes or hats or things to outstand
