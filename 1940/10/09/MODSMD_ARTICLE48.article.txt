# Cards Drill On Defense, New Tricks
## 
### 
The arc lights burned late 011
the Card practice field last night
as Head Coach Clark Shaugh
nessy drove his team through its
longest and hardest session of the
season in preparation for Satur
day's game with the Santa Clara
Broncos.
The Indians went through about
every routine in the booksâ€”work
ing on the tackling dummies, run
ning signals, running their plays
against dummies, and climaxed their
evening's work with an hour of
scrimmage.
With its offense pretty well oiled
up, Shaughnessy and Co. will today
turn its attention to stopping what
the Broncos have to offer. And this
will take a lot of drilling, for the
Card coaching staff has cooked up
half a dozen different defenses for
Saturday's tilt.
COACH IS OPTIMISTIC
Evidently these defensive for
mations are pretty varied and intri
cate, for Mr. Shaughnessy said,
"Those Broncs will be so confused
they won't know which man to
block."
There were several new faces on
the first two strings, caused by in
juries and improvement. One new
comer on the first string was Jack
Francis at guard in place of Dick
Palmer. Jack is a converted full
back from his freshman days and
showed some mighty sharp block
ing in last Saturday's Oregon tri
umph.
With Fred Meyer still on the
sidelines with a bad charley horse,
Bob Ditlevson was running at right
end. And with tail BUI Willard
on the sidelines indefinitely with
that trick knee of his, the list of
healthy ends is rather barren.
MEINERS PROMOTED
Yesterday the fiankmen in action
were the seasoned Stan Graff and
Ditlevsen for the first stringers and
Clemmie Tomerlin and Arnold
Meiners, who hay moved up, oper
ating for the seconds.
Those two burly tackles, Ed
Stamm and Rod Warnecke, are
having a hot fight for the starting
post at left tackle. So far Warnecke
hus had the edge, but Stamm's
great improvement at his new tackle
post in the last two weeks has been
remarkable.
In the backfield Ray Hammett
handled the quarterback assign
ments during the scrimmage in
order to save first stringer Frank
Albert who has a twisted knee.
"Midget A1 Cole has moved into
the second string left halfback spot
j on the strength of his passing and
jackrabbit running.
