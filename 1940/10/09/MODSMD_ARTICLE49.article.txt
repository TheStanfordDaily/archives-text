Although Coach Harry Maloney
I won't announce his starting line
up until just before game time,
| several veterans seem sure of
j starting assignments for this af
ternoon's sorter opener wtih Menio
J.C.
The Indians will probaby field a
j team of nine lettermen and two new
| comers. Co-captains George Dole
j and George LaNicca will handle the
right side of the forward line wjth
Francis Morgan at center forward
and Teller Weiiwnann at left wing.
After last week's scrimmages, inside
left is wide open and Coach Maloney
has yet to fill this green spot in the
line with a capable man.
Successor to the sensational Tito
Sanz-Agero, Jack Burns draws the
starting assignment in the goal with
a seasoned backfield ahead of him
that includes lullbacks Ned Pugh
and Dick Harman, and halfbacks
Wilson Clark and Gordy Nicoll,
Sophomore Ray Chapot has just
about cinched the right half spot
showing a lot of fire in recent
scrimmages.
Two more backfield men who will
probably see action are Louis Ariz
mendi and Fernando Eleta, both
newcomers who have shown up well
in practice sessions.
Competition in the California In-
I tercollegiate Soccer League is get
ting tougher every season and this
year two new teams have entered
the association, Cal Aggies and San
Francisco State's Alligators.
