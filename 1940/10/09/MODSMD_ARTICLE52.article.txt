# Struggle for Peace
## 
### 
AFTER hedging the issue for two meetings,
Ex Committee last night faced squarely
the question of whether or not it should junk
the Farm's Peace Day.
A report from Associated Students repre
sentatives who discussed the matter with Presi
dent Wilbur and the Committee on Public Ex
ercises brought forth several statements of in
terest to students of the University. One of
these was Dr. Wilbur's contention that "in a
world in which there is no peace, how can we
hold a Peace Day?"
But, after weighing all probable courses of
action, Ex Committee voted, with one dissenting
voice, to appoint a chairman of Peace Day and
to continue to commemorate the principles
upon which Peace Day was founded.
This action, a perilous one, indicates that
American college students, in the face of tre
mendous obstacles that strive to crush con
structive thought, can still legislate, intelligently
and coolly, for the ideals that have contributed
most to civilization's growth.
Ex Committee, by standing firmly for some
form of peace meeting, leaves itself open to
criticism for fostering "appeasement" in Amer
ica's foreign relations. This, of course, is not
true. Stanford students certainly do not believe
that America should go unprepared into the
next few troublesome years. By discussing the
problems and methods of peace, Stanford need
not condemn conscription and defense meas
ures. It may and undoubtedly will approve and
advocate them.
Furthermore, there are those who believe
that a Peace Day, in these turbulent times, might
create criticism of the University as a hot-bed
of fifth-columnists, seeking to undermine U.S.
preparedness by urging anti-war discussion.
This, again, would be untrue. Stanford has few
fifth-columnists. Properly administered, with a
competent, thoroughly American leader, Peace
Day might deal constructively with such prob
lems as the infiltration of foreign propaganda
and its threat to democratic ideals. Correctly
handled, the Farm's Peace Day may be a tre
mendous factor in stiffening public opinion in
favor of fundamental freedoms and the rigid
defense of essential American virtues.
The United States stands alone today as the
only major power in the world that is not at
war. The United States protects and respects
liberty. And the United States venerates peace.
If it is possible for this nation to escape the hor
rible demoralization of war, it must do so. And
if it is possible for college students to discuss'
the diseases that, fermenting in the cauldron of
hate that brews nationalism and strife, sap the
life-blood of freedom and democracy, it is well
that they do soâ€”now, before it is too late to
speak.
The attempt to conserve the spiritual values
of devotion to country with the higher values
of devotion to humanity was once phrased by
Santayana:
A man's feet must be planted in his country,
but his eyes should survey the world. What a
statesman might well aim at would be to give
the special sentiments and gifts of his country
men such a turn that, while continuing all vital
traditions, they might find less and less of what
is human alien to their genius. Differences in
nationality, founded on race and habitat, must
always subsist; but what has been superadded
artificially by ignorance and bigotry may be
gradually abolished in view of universal rela
tions better understood. There is a certain plane
on which all races, if they reach it at all, must
live in common, the plane of morals and sci
ence; which is not to say that even in those
activities the mind betrays no racial accent.
What is excluded from science and morals is not
variety, but contradiction. Any community
which had begun to cultivate the Life of Reason
in tho.-,e highest fields would tend to live rn
tionally on all subordinate levels also . .
