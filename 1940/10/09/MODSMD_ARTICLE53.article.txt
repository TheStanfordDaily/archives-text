### BUD AMES 
IT'S ALL HOW YOU HEAD IT
B EF ORE you read very much farther in this nasty,
nasty, nasty column, it would prove well worth
your while to run quickly through the Campus Opinion
letter printed below under the title "Aliasâ€”A True
Patriot." So put down that cup of coffee, or that book,
or what ever you are doing and read the weighty
words of Mr. L. S., Jr.
(Reading time: 16 seconds as checked by the watch.)
All through? Okey. Well, as you can see, Mr. L. S.
Jr. took it upon himself to get riled up about a few
gentle, good-natured digs made concerning the Ameri
can public in the light of the pressing Conscription
Bill. Now don't get us wrong now, readers, we are
not trying to poke fun at Mr. L. S. Jr., or at any of
you L.S.'s who have written, are writing, or plan to
jot off Campus Opinion letters. Those letters are the
voice of all campus dwellers, and, on such, they are
welcomed with open arms now thoroughly blackened
with Daily ink.
But sometimes you just don't seem to understand
the goal of things that go on in this column.
* * * *
| SEE by your letter, L. S., that this column made
mockery and degrading inferences toward the
Conscription Act. A recheck of last Monday's Daily
shows this not to be the case. Every reference to the
Conscription Bill was printed in crisp, factual, accu
rate statements.
The mockery and the degrading inferences were
directed not toward the bill; they punched at those of
the American public (that may be you, Bub) who fall
within the scope of that bill.
Maybe, L.S., you don't think some of us will be
hanging our Christmas stockings on the rifle racks.
Maybe you don't think some of us will creep rather
than leap to arms.
Maybe you don't think some of us will be looking
around for a few dependents.
Maybe you think the Mormons didn't have the
right idea.
Bub, you're nuts.
* * * *
r r , IIE fact that you were motivated by an inherent
patriotic spirit can not and may not be disputed
for a moment, L.S. In times like these, a good shot of
patriotism is what a few more people need. Most of us
around The Daily have gotten so patriotic that, when
warming up on the typewriter, we write, "Now is the
time to come to the aid of the UNITED STATES, AND
DEMOCRACY," instead of "Now the party."
This business of conscription is pretty serious. Since
it is now a law, it should be supported by the people,
you, and you, and you, who have made it a law. And
we sincerely mean that.
The question of Communism is now a serious and
pressing one here in the United States. So serious
that you probably gave up going to see that comedy
movie, "He Stayed for Breakfast," L.S., because it
dealt lighthly with the Communistic theory.
Now didn't you?
To mock and degrade an accepted principle is one
thing. To mock and degrade the foolish antics of
people in general is another. Perhaps you didn't read
last Monday's column carefully enough.
