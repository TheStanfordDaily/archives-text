# CAMPUS OPINION
## ALIASâ€”A TRUE PATRIOT 
### 
r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
In spite of all the opposition to the draft act be
fore it became a law, I think that now the majority
of U. S. citizens are for conscription.- That goes for
those on the Stanford campus, too. In any event,
though, it is our duty to support the laws of this
country whether or not we personally agree to them.
Therefore, in the name of all decent American citizens,
I object to Mr. Bud Ames' mockery and degrading in
ferences toward the conscription act in today's Daily.
L. S., Jr.
