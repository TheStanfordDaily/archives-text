# WHAT'S THE SCORE?

### 
r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
"October 17, 1940 . . . That's the day Japanese
newspapers have set for the start of the second World
War." So read Bob Low's "History. . .1940" column this
Monday. For several days Bob has been warning us
about Japan's ever-increasing saber-rattling in the
East.
And now, backed up by Berlin and Rome, Tokyo is
telling us to keep in our place—or else. According to
Bob, the U. S. isn't scared that easily. And, declared
Secretary of the Navy Knox, while calling up all the
Navy and Marine reserves, "The recent military alli
ance of Japan, Germany, and Italy is directed at us."
Just why has Bob, along with Knox, jumped on the
war chariot? Why is our one ocean navy protecting us
from that second "Mad Kaiser" by cruising over to
Singapore?
Perhaps it's to help Nationalist China in her fight
for freedom. If so then why did we stand by for six
years, giving all aid to Japan, until China's fight has
changed from a defensive to an offensive war? Is it to
protect "our" interests of tin and rubber in the East
Indies?
If that's the case we should have taken steps long
ago to free Indo-China from French colonial oppres
sion. Furthermore, I understand that there's an em
bryonic Indo-Chinese Nationalist movement that
wouldn't appreciate either Japanese or American "aid."
Will Bob Low or Frank Knox or somebody please
tell me why we're rushing so furiously to war?

r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
"October 17, 1940 . . . That's the day Japanese
newspapers have set for the start of the second World
War." So read Bob Low's "History. . .1940" column this
Monday. For several days Bob has been warning us
about Japan's ever-increasing saber-rattling in the
East.
And now, backed up by Berlin and Rome, Tokyo is
telling us to keep in our place—or else. According to
Bob, the U. S. isn't scared that easily. And, declared
Secretary of the Navy Knox, while calling up all the
Navy and Marine reserves, "The recent military alli
ance of Japan, Germany, and Italy is directed at us."
Just why has Bob, along with Knox, jumped on the
war chariot? Why is our one ocean navy protecting us
from that second "Mad Kaiser" by cruising over to
Singapore?
Perhaps it's to help Nationalist China in her fight
for freedom. If so then why did we stand by for six
years, giving all aid to Japan, until China's fight has
changed from a defensive to an offensive war? Is it to
protect "our" interests of tin and rubber in the East
Indies?
If that's the case we should have taken steps long
ago to free Indo-China from French colonial oppres
sion. Furthermore, I understand that there's an em
bryonic Indo-Chinese Nationalist movement that
wouldn't appreciate either Japanese or American "aid."
Will Bob Low or Frank Knox or somebody please
tell me why we're rushing so furiously to war?
