# BURGLARS HOLD PARTY
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 8 (UP).â€”
Police tonight sought a group of
youthful burglars who broke into
the Park-Presidio Junior High
School, collected a variety of loot
and held a party in the school cafe
teria. Traces of lipstick on two
drinking cups indicated the group
included girls.
The amount of water that air can
hold is dependent on its pressure
and temperature.
