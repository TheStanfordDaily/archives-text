Comfort's the Keynote of Casual Clothes
Somehow these jackets and slacks of ours arc classified
as sportswear. But actually, they arc worn for many more
occasions than just sports. Students wear them on the
campus. We've seen them in offices where informality
reigns. Esquire reports them on city streets. They're
casual clothes built for a man's comfort . . . and smart
appearance.
