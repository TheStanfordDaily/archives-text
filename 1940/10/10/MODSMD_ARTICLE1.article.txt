### BOB LOW 
OUMANIA, it appears from yes
terday's press dispatches, is
about to become a major "bomb
field" in the European war.
Until unconfirmed reports sev
eral days ago that German troops
were moving in the country, only
Rumanians and foreign agents in
Rumania were aware of the enor
mous extent of Nazi domination
there.
Within the past few months,
Rumania has been forced to cede
territory to Russia, Hungary, and
Bulgaria. Pressure has more re
cently been brought upon King
Carol to permit greater Iron
Guard participation in the gov
ernment. The king wished to re
sist these demands and attempted
for a time to suppress Nazi ele
ments in his government. But he
finally was compelled to abdicate;
and a pro-Nazi premier took over,
proclaiming a dictatorship.

It was not long before the usual
Nazi decrees were issued by the new
regime. Of particular interest to
Britons, and to Americans hopeful
of a British victory, were Rumania's
new relations with Germany.

WINCE March 1939 Rumania's in
ternal and external economics
have been controlled by the Nazis.
At that time, the Rumanians signed
an agreement with Germany where
by the Germans would receive some
90 per cent of Rumania's exports of
wheat and other agricultural prod
ucts. In addition, Germany was
given the right to supervise the Ru
manian railroad system and her ex
pansion program in the oil fields.
Germany also acquired certain free
dom in the use of the Danube and in
ports on the Black Sea. By this last
agreement, Russian oil exports to
Germany were greatly facilitated.
Yesterday's news of German troop
movements in Rumania is not a
great surprise, for the size of Ru
manian oil production and expan
sion is vital to Germany if she is to
win the battle over Britain.
Up to the present, Britain has
had no effective, legal way of cut
ling off Germany's importation of
oil from Rumania. But German
troop movements in Rumania may
cause the British to break off rela
tions with Rumania. If this is
done, it may he assumed that
British bombers from the Near
East will attempt to destroy the
Rumanian-Nazi oil industry.
The British minister to Rumania
this week asked that government's
pro-Nazi Premier Antonescu for
"elucidation" of German troop
movements in his country, but the
answer was said to be "negative."
More and more troops were ar
riving in Bucharest and other Ru
manian centers yesterday, presum
ably to instruct and reorganize the
Rumanian Army in Nazi methods
of warfare and also to guard against
alleged British sabotage plots in the
oil fields.
Although Rumania is several
hundred miles from the actual
Battle of Britain, the consequences
of Nazi occupation of Rumania
may have a direct hearing 011 the
outcome of the Battle of Britain.
The British may now cut off Ger
many's most important oil sup
ply.

following the Hitler - Mussolini
huddle the Axis would undertake
some new major campaign, perhaps
in the Mediterranean. Yesterday
Rome newspapers blew off against
Yugoslavia, criticizing the Balkan
country for delaying in "adapting
itself" to the "new Europe" plans of
the Axis.
Yugoslavia is in an especially pre
carious position. She is open to at
tack by the Italians from Albania on
the South arid from Fiunie and Tri
este on the North. And with Ger
man troops in Rumania, she is vul
nerable from the East. The Adriatic
Sea on the West is controlled by the

Yugoslavia is in an especially pre

OUMANIA, it appears from yes

Rumanians and foreign agents in

there.
Within the past few months,
Rumania has been forced to cede
territory to Russia, Hungary, and

for a time to suppress Nazi ele

finally was compelled to abdicate;
and a pro-Nazi premier took over,
proclaiming a dictatorship.

It was not long before the usual
Nazi decrees were issued by the new

Britons, and to Americans hopeful
of a British victory, were Rumania's
new relations with Germany.

WINCE March 1939 Rumania's in
ternal and external economics
have been controlled by the Nazis.
At that time, the Rumanians signed
an agreement with Germany where
by the Germans would receive some
90 per cent of Rumania's exports of
wheat and other agricultural prod
ucts. In addition, Germany was
given the right to supervise the Ru
manian railroad system and her ex

Germany also acquired certain free
