Despite denials by President Roosevelt, the rumor continues
to be circulated by authoritative political observers that nego
tiations are in progress for sending 25 U.S. "flying fortresses"
to England, in a deal similar to the destroyer exchange.
Stanford students approve of such action, but believe that
Congress should have the final say on the matter. In a survey
of campus opinion conducted by The Stanford Daily, 65 per cent
of the students guestioned approved of sending Britain the army
bombers, 26 per cent disapproved, and 9 per cent were unde
cided.
The student cross-section was further asked, "Do you think
Congress should vote on such a deal or is presidential sanction
sufficient?" Sixty-nine per cent answerd "Congress should vote,"
25 per cent said Presidential sanction sufficient," and 6 per cent
were undecided.
A definite trend is revealed when the cross-section is broken
up according to classes, the results of which follow:
Approve Disapprove Undecided
Freshman 79% 21% 0%
Sophomore 88% 12% 0%
Junior 56% 38% 6%
Senior 40% 35% 25%
Graduates 64% 33% 3%
(All percentages less than .5 are considered 0.)
Men are more doubtful about sending the planes than women;
63 per cent of thp men approved, while 70 per cent of the women
favored the deal. But 30 per cent of the men disapproved and
only 17 per cent of the women said no deal.
Little difference in opinion is indicated between Row and
Hall affiliates, but the independents appear to be more wary of
the proposed action.
Approve Disapprove Undecided
Row 67% 28% 5%
Hall 67% 19% 14%
Independents ... 57% 29% 14%
(Freshmen and graduates are not included in the above.)
Several students were adamant in the need for sending a'd
to Britain: "Britain is our first line of defense. It is imperative that
v e give all aid." "Ought to be more than 25 planes." In answer
to the "Congress vote or presidential sanction" guestion, such
lemarks were made:
"Presidential sanction only in immediate emergency." "Too
much red tape involved in Congress."
