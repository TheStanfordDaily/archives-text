### 
In a sweeping move to adjust all
campus fund drives to a long- j
range pattern, Kx Committee last j
Tuesday named John Porter as j
chairman of a committee to draw
up a "Drives Calendar."
"All campus, or off-campus, [
groups that annually sponsor ;
some sort of solicitation of stu
dents' funds should submit their
intention to promote such an ac
tivity and its preferable date to
the A.S.S.U. office by Friday," ;
Porter said yesterday.
Such drives would include the i
Red Cross Drive, the Fund Drive,
March of Dimes, and similar ap
peals. he indicated. Serving with
Porter on the committee are Pat
Adams and Dwight Hutchinson.
