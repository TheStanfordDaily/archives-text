# F.R. Offers Draft Post To Educator
## Wisconsin U. Head 'Considers' Position; Pressure Is Hinted 
### 
WASHINGTON. Oct. !) (UP).â€”
President Roosevelt today offered
the important job of directing the
forthcoming draft to Clarence A.
Dykstra, 57-year-old president of
the University of Wisconsin and
former city manager of Cincinnati,
0., who said he would "consider"
the appointment.

As draft director, Dykstra would
be responsible for marshaling the
nation's manpower for army train
ing. He was understood to be re
luctant to leave his university post
but considerable pressure report
edly was being exerted to persuade
him to accept the offer.
Mr. Roosevelt's offer to Dykstra
high-lighted a busy day on the de
fense front, during which these im
portant developments also occurred:
DEFENSE HIGHLIGHTS
1. Draft officials predicted most of
the 400,000 men to be called up be
fore Jan. 1 for training under the
recently enacted draft law will be
volunteers. State selective service
offices were said to be "flooded with
volunteers."
2. The Senate moved to wind up
loose ends on its calendar of de
fense legislation by approving a bill
to authorize establishment of home
guard military units to replace Na
tional Guard contingents called to
active duty. It goes back to the
House for consideration of Senate
amendments.
3. A group of defense chieftains
conferred with Secretary of the
Treasury Henry Morgenthau, Jr.,
but. refused to disclose the topic of
the conversations. Reliable sources
indicated they discussed methods of
speeding production of military air
craft for Great Britain.
GUARD BILL PASSED
Dykstra was offered the draft di
rectorship when he visited the White
House accompanied by Secretary of
War Henry L. Stimson. When he
left .he told reporters "we have been
talking about" the directorship but
that "I will have to do some con
sidering." Lieutenant Colonel Lewis
B. Hershey is serving temporarily
as conscription chieftain.
The home guard bill was passed
by the Senate by a voice vote, with
several "no's" resounding through
the chamber. Senators Alva B.
Adams and Edwin C. Johnson, both
Colorado Democrats, led the oppo
sition. Johnson termed it "as use
less as three thumbs on a hitch
hiker."
Urged by Stimson, the bill pro
vides for creation of an entirely new
military unit which Johnson said
sooner or later' would conflict with
the established militia. It would
empower the Secretary of War to
issue arms and equipment for the
new home guard units on request
of state Governors.
Secretary of the Navy Frank
Knox announced award of contracts
to 19 firms for construction of new
ordnance and shipbuilding facilities
to cost $96,146,000.
