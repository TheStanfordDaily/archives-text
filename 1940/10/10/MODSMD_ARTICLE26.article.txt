# Research Efforts Crowned As Engineers Harness Wind

### 
The extensive research of Stanford's aeronautical engineers in gener
ating electricity from the wind is beginning to bear fruit. This project, after
much experimentation and research has at last been proved practicable.
The Central Vermont Public Service Corporation lias already started
work on a huge turbine which will receive its power from the wind which

lashes Grandpa's Knob, near Hub
barton, Virginia. When completed,
the peak will boast a 100-foot tower
of steel.
The preliminary research for this
plan was carried on in the Guggen
heim Aeronautical Laboratory at
Stanford, where numerous experi
ments were made using small mod
els. The full-scale project is the re
sult of the collaboration of Stan
ford technical men, engineers of
various leading corporations, and
scientists from the California and
Massachusetts Institutes of Tech
nology. The turbine was designed
by Palmer C. Putnam, Boston engi
neer.
The project, which has long been
in the minds of scientists and execu
tives of the power industry, was
deemed feasible after consultation
and experimentation, and construc
tion was begun in Vermont. When
completed, it will be the largest
"windmill" in the world.
