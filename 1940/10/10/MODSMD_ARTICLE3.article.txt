If the United States goes to war
with Japan it will be over their re
spective sympathies in the Euro
pean conflict and not over the
American interests in the Far East,
according to Dr. John Masland of
the political science department. He
and Dr. Philip Buck addressed the
first meeting of the International Re-
I lations Club yesterday.
"Japan has been our third best
customer for quite a few years. We
happen to be her best customer," Dr.
Masland stated in pointing out the
great economic disadvantages in
volved in a conflict with Japan.
In answer to the problem of
Japan's taking over the Dutch East
Indies with its supply of rubber and
tin, Dr. Masland remarked, "No mat
ter who controls those sources down
there, the goods would still be for
sale."
He expressed the belief that a
conflict with Japan would mark the
beginning of an entirely new foreign
policy in this country, a "benevo
lent belligerency" similar to the po
licing power Great Britain has ex
ercised during the last century.
