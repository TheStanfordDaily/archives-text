# Soccer Squad Smears Menlo
## Oaks Defeated 4 to 0 As Dole Paces Cards 
### 
Slicing through Menlo J. C.'s hard
fighting defense twice in the early j
moments of the first quarter and 1
again in the final period, Stanford's
soccer squad yesterday blanked the
Menlo Park team. 4-0. Co-captain i
George Dole accounted for the two
tallies in the opening period, and I
Ken Say re and Joe MacHarg added
another pair in the last quarter.
The fast-charging Indian for
wards continually threatened the
Menlo goal, but an effective defense |
held the Cards in check. For the !
greater part of the game, the ball !
was in Menlo territory, with only |
an occasional thrust toward the j
Stanford goal. Whenever the play !
was forced into the Indian half of
the field, the Card defense swung j
into action and soon had the ball
worked back toward the Oak goal.
DOLE BOOTS TWO GOALS
A few moments after the opening !
kick Dole booted the ball into the
net for the first score. He added the
second tally a short while later and
then the Menlo defensive play began i
to click and the Cards were held i
scoreless for Ihe next two quarters. <
At the beginning of the final period, j
the Oak defense cracked for the
third time and Sayre dropped one
past the goalie to add another point.
As the quarter neared an end, Mac-
Harg added the fourth and final '
score.
This was the Indians' opening tilt
and play was well polished for an I
early season game. Kicking was
accurate, passing was good, and j
head play was effective. Offensive i
play was fast from beginning to end !
and never gave the Oak goalie a 1
moment's rest. Defensive work, al
though only occasionally called on,
functioned effectively when neces
sary.

The fast-charging Indian for
wards continually threatened the
Menlo goal, but an effective defense |
held the Cards in check. For the !
greater part of the game, the ball !
was in Menlo territory, with only |
an occasional thrust toward the j
Stanford goal. Whenever the play !
was forced into the Indian half of
the field, the Card defense swung j
into action and soon had the ball
worked back toward the Oak goal.
DOLE BOOTS TWO GOALS
A few moments after the opening !
kick Dole booted the ball into the
net for the first score. He added the
second tally a short while later and
then the Menlo defensive play began i
to click and the Cards were held i
scoreless for Ihe next two quarters. <
At the beginning of the final period, j
the Oak defense cracked for the
third time and Sayre dropped one
past the goalie to add another point.
As the quarter neared an end, Mac-
Harg added the fourth and final '
score.
This was the Indians' opening tilt
and play was well polished for an I
early season game. Kicking was
accurate, passing was good, and j
head play was effective. Offensive i
play was fast from beginning to end !
and never gave the Oak goalie a 1
moment's rest. Defensive work, al
though only occasionally called on,
functioned effectively when neces
sary.
