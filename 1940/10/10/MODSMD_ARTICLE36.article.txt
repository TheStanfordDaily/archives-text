# Ailing Cards Prepare for Bronco Tilt
## 
### 
On Jhe surface Stanford's var
sity foot hull team with every man
hut one in uniform looked sound
and hcnlthy at yesterday's prac
tice. IJ;il hencath those shoulder
pads ami thigh guards were some
sore shoulders, had charley horses,
and twisted joints.
P reddie Meyer, first-string end,
was back in uniform for (he first
time since Saturday's game, when
he picked up a bad charley horse.
Bill Willard fclso was cavorting
around at yesterday's practice with
his trick knee in a brace. And an
other of Shaughnessy's ends, Hank
Norberg, was still withholding him
self from any sort of contact work
to protect his damaged shoulder.
KNEK WORRIES ALBERT
Frankie Albert, regular quarter
back, is still worried by a knee he
twisted against Oregon and which
kept him from Tuesday's scrimmage.
Thor Peterson, erstwhile second
string fullback, seemed fit enough
yesterday but he probably will not
see any action because of a couple
of mending ribs.
The only man not in uniform on
Coach Shaughnessy's apparently
healthy squad was Clyde "Fastest
•Vlan -in- a - Football-Suit" Jeffrey.
Jfefi has a sore ankle which he rested
up yesterday but which will not
keep him out of a suit on Saturday.
Mr. Shaughnessy has all this pius
Santa Clara's rampaging Broncos
to contend with this Saturday. Prob
ably the most crucial part of this im
posing list of minor injuries is the
number of first or second-string
ends laid up.
BRONCOS BLOCK WELL
The Broncos' coach, Buck Shaw,
has always had a couple of fast
backs and plenty of sharp blockers
to make his end runs dangerous.
Ibis week-end these end runs might
well be twice as effective with the
Card wingmen in such a weakened
condition.
True, Meyer will be able to start,
but if those Bronc blockers go to
Work rather roughly on his painful
charley horse the results might be
disastrous. With Norberg and Wil
lard hardly in condition to play any
football under fire, the Indians are
entirely barren of any big ends.
So it's going to be up to the little
fellows to stop those Santa Clara
sweeps. Regular Stan Graff and sec
ond-stringer Arnold Meiners looked
rugged enough last Saturday in !
"stopping the Ducks, but second- I
stringers Clemmie Tommerlin and
Bob Ditlevsen are a little too light
to handle a trio of hard-blocking
backs and guards.
C'OACII HATCHES PLANS
Yesterday Shaughnessy and the
rest of his board of strategy, Jim
Lawson, Phil Bengtson, and Marchie 1
Schwartz, presented to the varsity
their plans of stopping that potent
Bronco offense. And the squad
spent the afternoon and will spend
most of today s practice learning the
intricate defensive formations. The
Cards will have enough variations
on defense to cross up entirely the
Santa Clara blockers and in this
way hope to stop their offense be
fore it gets a chance to get started.
Santa Clara looked very irnpres- j
sive to the Indians when they bowled
! hrough Utah •14-13. Shaw seems as
usual to have a half a dozen dyna
mite backs. The current crop j
which will get in the Cards' hair I
this Saturday include Jimmy John-
M.n, Ward Heiser, Dick Clark, and
John Hanna, all who saw action in i
that 2;-7 debacle of last year, and
newcomers Kenny Casanega and j
Harry Saunders.

which will get in the Cards' hair I
this Saturday include Jimmy John-
M.n, Ward Heiser, Dick Clark, and
John Hanna, all who saw action in i
that 2;-7 debacle of last year, and
newcomers Kenny Casanega and j
Harry Saunders.
On Jhe surface Stanford's var
sity foot hull team with every man
hut one in uniform looked sound
and hcnlthy at yesterday's prac
tice. IJ;il hencath those shoulder
pads ami thigh guards were some
sore shoulders, had charley horses,
and twisted joints.
P reddie Meyer, first-string end,
was back in uniform for (he first
time since Saturday's game, when
he picked up a bad charley horse.
Bill Willard fclso was cavorting
around at yesterday's practice with
his trick knee in a brace. And an
other of Shaughnessy's ends, Hank
Norberg, was still withholding him
self from any sort of contact work
to protect his damaged shoulder.
KNEK WORRIES ALBERT
Frankie Albert, regular quarter
back, is still worried by a knee he
twisted against Oregon and which
kept him from Tuesday's scrimmage.
Thor Peterson, erstwhile second
string fullback, seemed fit enough
yesterday but he probably will not
see any action because of a couple
of mending ribs.
The only man not in uniform on
Coach Shaughnessy's apparently
healthy squad was Clyde "Fastest
•Vlan -in- a - Football-Suit" Jeffrey.
Jfefi has a sore ankle which he rested
up yesterday but which will not
keep him out of a suit on Saturday.
Mr. Shaughnessy has all this pius
Santa Clara's rampaging Broncos
to contend with this Saturday. Prob
ably the most crucial part of this im
posing list of minor injuries is the
number of first or second-string
ends laid up.
BRONCOS BLOCK WELL
The Broncos' coach, Buck Shaw,
has always had a couple of fast
backs and plenty of sharp blockers
to make his end runs dangerous.
Ibis week-end these end runs might
well be twice as effective with the
Card wingmen in such a weakened
condition.
True, Meyer will be able to start,
but if those Bronc blockers go to
Work rather roughly on his painful
charley horse the results might be
disastrous. With Norberg and Wil
lard hardly in condition to play any
football under fire, the Indians are
entirely barren of any big ends.
So it's going to be up to the little
fellows to stop those Santa Clara
sweeps. Regular Stan Graff and sec
ond-stringer Arnold Meiners looked
rugged enough last Saturday in !
"stopping the Ducks, but second- I
stringers Clemmie Tommerlin and
Bob Ditlevsen are a little too light
to handle a trio of hard-blocking
backs and guards.
C'OACII HATCHES PLANS
Yesterday Shaughnessy and the
rest of his board of strategy, Jim
Lawson, Phil Bengtson, and Marchie 1
Schwartz, presented to the varsity
their plans of stopping that potent
Bronco offense. And the squad
spent the afternoon and will spend
most of today s practice learning the
intricate defensive formations. The
Cards will have enough variations
on defense to cross up entirely the
Santa Clara blockers and in this
way hope to stop their offense be
fore it gets a chance to get started.
Santa Clara looked very irnpres- j
sive to the Indians when they bowled
! hrough Utah •14-13. Shaw seems as
usual to have a half a dozen dyna
mite backs. The current crop j
which will get in the Cards' hair I
this Saturday include Jimmy John-
