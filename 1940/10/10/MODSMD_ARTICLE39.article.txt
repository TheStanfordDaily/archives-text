JN THEIR first two games the boys
that carry the mail for Clark
Shaughnessy's Indian raiding crew
have built up nice fat ball-carrying
averages.
Hugh Gallarneau. mainly because
of two beautiful runs in the Ore
gon tilt, is leading the Stanford
hacks in the yards gained and av
erage-per-play departments. The
Duke, in the two games, has car
ried the ball 14 times and gained a
net of 12!) yards, an average of
!(.2 yards per play.
Norm Standlee has a two-game
average of 5.2 yards per try. The
Chief has been doing more work
than the other backs, having toted
the ball 22 times so far.
Left half Peter G. Kmetovic is
leading the Coast in scoring. Two
touchdowns in the U.S.F. "contest"
and one against Oregon give him an
18-point total. "Kmet." has a ground
gaining average of 6.4 yards per
crack.
Leading the sophomore backs is
Eric "Scooter" Armstrong. Arm
strong has lugged the ball eight
times for a (5.3 average.
* ❖ »|t
r Keebles evidently got
their wires crossed. After an
. nouncing that Dick Palmer was
the winner of the weekly pen
award, they decided to include
Chuck Taylor in and give the
boys duplicate prizes. Which re
minds me. my Woolworth Special
is pretty well battered. Maybe I
should go out to practice and see
if I can get discovered.

r J" I RICKY Dick Hyland, experting
for NBC's Friday eve football
program, seems to be the boy to
listen to if one wants to find out
how the Indians are going to come
out the next afternoon.
He called the results of the first
two games correctly, although the
scores he named turned out to be a
little conservative.
The program, emanating from
Hollywood and broadcast locally
over KGO, starts at 8 o'clock.

r J" I RICKY Dick Hyland, experting
for NBC's Friday eve football
program, seems to be the boy to
listen to if one wants to find out
how the Indians are going to come
out the next afternoon.
He called the results of the first
two games correctly, although the
scores he named turned out to be a
little conservative.
The program, emanating from
Hollywood and broadcast locally
over KGO, starts at 8 o'clock.
JN THEIR first two games the boys
that carry the mail for Clark
Shaughnessy's Indian raiding crew
have built up nice fat ball-carrying
averages.
Hugh Gallarneau. mainly because
of two beautiful runs in the Ore
gon tilt, is leading the Stanford
hacks in the yards gained and av
erage-per-play departments. The
Duke, in the two games, has car
ried the ball 14 times and gained a
net of 12!) yards, an average of
!(.2 yards per play.
Norm Standlee has a two-game
average of 5.2 yards per try. The
Chief has been doing more work
than the other backs, having toted
the ball 22 times so far.
Left half Peter G. Kmetovic is
leading the Coast in scoring. Two
touchdowns in the U.S.F. "contest"
and one against Oregon give him an
18-point total. "Kmet." has a ground
gaining average of 6.4 yards per
crack.
Leading the sophomore backs is
Eric "Scooter" Armstrong. Arm
strong has lugged the ball eight
times for a (5.3 average.

r Keebles evidently got
their wires crossed. After an
. nouncing that Dick Palmer was
the winner of the weekly pen
award, they decided to include
Chuck Taylor in and give the
boys duplicate prizes. Which re
minds me. my Woolworth Special
is pretty well battered. Maybe I
should go out to practice and see
if I can get discovered.
