STANFORD men will form a line 1,750 per
sons long next Wednesday . . . somewhere,
sometime, under certain conditions . . . prepara
tory to registration for one year's worth of mili
tary service under the terms and provisions of
the conscription bill. At this instant, not more
than a meager handful possesses further in
formation about the responsibilities that will be
theirs on October 16, registration day.
Acting with forethought and unexpected
speed, Excom Tuesday night presented the
campus with a mechanism intended to smooth
the troubles surrounding draft registration.
Imposingly entitled the "Stanford National
Emergency Committee," the group, headed by
Bill Turner, will face equally imposing problems
before its job is complete. Their double-bar
reled duty—first clearing the path for actual reg
istration, then giving advice for further Stanford
training which will mesh with certain military
services—cannot be completed at the drop of a
hat.
Their most obvious problem is the gathering
of information on the actual mechanics of the
draft, for the "when's, where's and how's" of
registration still remain unanswered as Con
gress and President Roosevelt continue untan
gling the snarl of red tape surrounding the bill.
But of equal interest to the 1,750 Stanford men
who will register for service are a multitude of
uncertainties which have not been conclusively
answered. Some are purely personal, the
greater portion apply to all. The latter problems
will concern the Stanford National Emergency
Committee.
These issues have been tough kernels to
crack in bull sessions, have been tossed back
and forth across dinner tables, have provided
coke-hour conversation for eligible Stanford
men who wonder:
(1) Will we be subject to instant call in July
should our names be drawn next week? Our
occupational status as students renders us in
eligible for present service. Will our names be
dropped back in the hat from which the draw
ings will be made next summer, or will we go
on record as "set for duty, July, 1941."
(2) Will our names be drawn as of the Stan
ford University district, or as of the district in
which we live? Should next week's drawings
rubber-stamp us for training, will that service
be given in this vicinity or in the area of our
homes?

(3) Does the fact that we are not 21 years of
age now but will be in the near future mean
that we need not register at all? Or will there
be another registration date set in July or at
some earlier period?

(4) Will the fact that we have more than one
year remaining before completing our Stan
ford educations have any bearing upon our eli
gibility? Might conscription keep us from grad
uation in 1942 or will our service be deferred
until that time?
(5) What opportunities will we have for tech
nical or other training between October 16 and
July? Would such training prove of any bene
fit?

(6) How will the fact that we are members of
the Reserve Officers Training Corps affect us?
Do we register next week in spite of this past
training? Does possession of a reserve com
mission render us subject to perhaps a longer
period of service after graduation, or does it
exempt us from such training?
There are more problems, some of equal
significance. The services which the Stanford
National Emergency Committee can render
through their clarification should be many fold.
Their work will be answering the questions.
