# HULL SESSION
## RALLY COMMITTEE WILL RALLY 
### BUD AMES 
r subject for today's open-forum isn't our idea.
At least it wasn't until the campus protests had
mounted to such surprising heights that public dis
cussion became derogatory.
The protests center around those plaster-pieces of
literary regurgitation found gummed to every self
respecting windshield yesterday morning. General
opinion has it that this year's car stickers aren't so
popular. In fact, a great part of the Stanford family
think they stink.
THINKO they STINKO.
That's a lulu, ain't it kids? Ain't that a pip?
But don t laugh too hard, or you may wake up
one of these misty mornings and find it plastered all
over your room. Those Rally Committee members
have a way of getting in everyplace.
"Their idea to pep us up is 0.K.. but when they go
so far as to invade the sanctity of my garage, well—
that s going too far, one lusty Stanfordite moaned
yesterday.
* * # *
these expressed thoughts will bring
a few scalding letters from loyal members of the
Rally Committee. "Bull Session was absolutely hate
ful, absolutely hateful, the way it toi'e at our very
throats, those letters will read. "After all, we are
only doing our job the best way we know how. Aren't
those protesters loyal to Stanford?"
Yes, every protester is as loyal to the Farm as
every member of the diligent Rally Committee. But
that is not the crux of the matter. They just don't
think the slogans hit the old "pepper-upper" nail on
the head.
"They re just too cute," runs general comment.
"Somebody must be killing himself turning out those
punchy slogans. Just how does one quench a quack?"
Somebody else added, "The sticker idea is a good
one, but their significance has been worn thin an an
effort to be overly funny. Last year's slogans would
be better than something we can't fathom."
So you see, Mr. and Miss Rally Committee—it is the
Stanfordites who have lodged this protest. Bull Ses
sion merely speaks for them now.

li u , T why didn't somebody try going directly to a
Rally Committee member, and saying, "Now look
here, Homer, about these windshield stickers, etc.
etc.... What do ya say?"
Somebody tried just that. Let's see- that was yes
terday morning about 11 o'clock in the Cellar. A
loyal Stanfordite approached a snippy little member
of Rally Committee while she was waiting at the self
service counter. While she waited she was distributing
a couple of those "Konko Bronco'' things.
"You know," this Stanfordite said. "I don't think
this year's stickers are so good."
The Rally Committee miss turned around and in
the nastiest tones hissed, ''We don't give a damn what
you think."
No, she probably didn't. The Rally Committee was
created for the Rally Committee. They must have a
swell time pepping each other up. To hell with what
the rest of the campus things.
Sincerely now, as a whole .the Rally Committee un
questionably isn't like that individual miss. But the
Rally Committee has at times lost contact with cam
pus opinion. If they step down, off their rah-rah
clouds for a moment, and put their ears to the solid
Farm ground, next week's stickers will probably take
a turn for the better.
