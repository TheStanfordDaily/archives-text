EDITOR, SIR:

ford women a sort of Lochiel's Warning against taking,
undiluted, the sex appeal of Wendell Willkie:
Co-eds, Co-eds! beware of the day
When Willkie shall meet thee in utilities array.
Yes, indeed, Stanford ladies, decide this very hour
whether it is better to revive the worship of the
golden calf or stick to the Moses who, though opposed
by fearful odds, is surely leading the American people
out of the bondage of their utilities corporations.
