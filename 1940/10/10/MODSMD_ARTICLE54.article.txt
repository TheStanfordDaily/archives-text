# GIVE THEM A CHANCE

r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
You have stated in your letter (We Who Are
About to Die) that West Point is a school of social
etiquette, admission to which can be obtained only
through political friendship. You are partly right; but
you have overlooked the fact that men who go to The
Point are trained to be professional soldiers with a
knowledge of science that will be of little use to them
in a civil life.

The Pointer graduates expecting to put into prac
tice syme of the things he has learned, but he soon
finds tHat your government will not allow him enough
equipment or men to put these things into practice.

Never in the history of this young country has the
army been given what might be called a chance dur
ing time of peace. Each war we have entered has
found the army under-manned and under-equipped,
but with each war we have made advances. Today we
are underdoing our first peace-time conscription in
hopes that we can have a reserve of men who are
trained to protect us if need be.

Conscription in a democracy is a great and perhaps
a dangerous step for. when a country's armed forces
become so large that they run the country, the country
ceases to be a democracy. Only in countries where the
individual is nothing, and the state everything, is it
possible to have an army trained to the point where
it might be called invincible. Are you willing to make
the social adjustments necessary to have and maintain
an army which would suit your apparent taste?

If you can submit a better way of training men to
be officers in the regular and reserve armies I should
like very much to know that way.

In the meantime, may I suggest that you keep your
thoughts out of circulation, or you-will have some
power-minded people thinking that the only way the
faults you mentioned can be corrected is to change our
status from a country with an army to an army with
a country. Think it over and remember that we are
now trying to prepare.
Sincerely.

become so large that they run the country, the country
ceases to be a democracy. Only in countries where the
individual is nothing, and the state everything, is it
possible to have an army trained to the point where
it might be called invincible. Are you willing to make
the social adjustments necessary to have and maintain
an army which would suit your apparent taste?

If you can submit a better way of training men to
be officers in the regular and reserve armies I should
like very much to know that way.

In the meantime, may I suggest that you keep your
thoughts out of circulation, or you-will have some
power-minded people thinking that the only way the
faults you mentioned can be corrected is to change our
status from a country with an army to an army with
a country. Think it over and remember that we are
now trying to prepare.
Sincerely.
B. V. T.
