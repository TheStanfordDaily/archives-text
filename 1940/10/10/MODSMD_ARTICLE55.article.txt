r rHE EDITOR. SIR:
As we understand it. the State Narcotics Com
mission has long had a policy of keeping marihuana,
hashish, opium, laudanum, and cocaine away from
school children. We have but one brief question to ask.
How did the Rally Committee manage to get their
hands on this contraband? After jlieing such stuff
as "Quench the Quacks" and "Konko the Bronco" on
the windshields of numerous campus vehicles, we are
convinced that the kids ought to return to just plain
cokes.
Naiiseatedly yours.
