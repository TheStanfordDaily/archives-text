# Communists, Soup Bubble In 'Deb No. I'
## 
### 
"Public Del> No. 1," now playing at
the Stanford Theater
The character of Penny Cooper
(Brenda Joyce), debutante heiress
to the Cooper soup millions and
converted Communist, provides the
mainspring for the light, amusing
comedy "Public Deb No. 1." Penny,
to be sure, provides everyone quite
a spring, Laving "oeen converted to
the cause by the family's new Rus
sian butler (Mischa Auer), she pro
ceeds to make the headlines daily
with her new pet enthusiasm until
the whole nation boycotts Cooper
soup in protest against her "un-
American" activities.
When her fiance, Fairchild (Ralph
Bellamy), who is also running for
Congress on the Republican ticket,
takes her to her favorite Russian
restaurant the newly hired, clumsy
waiter (George Murphy) disagrees
with her political views, supposedly
defeats her arguments for the Cause,
heroically spanks the Red in public,
| gets thrown in jail and becomes a
I national hero.
SOL'P SALES CAREEN
Then Cooper soup sales really fall
! out of sight but fail to dampen Pen
! ny's enthusiasm until the butler
I points out that her income from
! the company is essential to the party.
! She carries out her plan to dismiss
charges against the waiter and
placate public opinion by being seen
j everywhere with him publicly, and
| then secretly plans to sell the com
pany when she comes of age.
The waiter's part of the bargain
is a vice-presidency in the com
pany, and when Penny starts to
hate him intensely the audience
knows how it's going to end. The
inevitable Hollywood solution is
made possible when news of politi
j cal events in Russia appears in the
I papers, everyone is shown up his
| true colors, and Penny realizes how
I evil communism really is.
Elsa Maxwell pops in and out of
the picture and, except for the fact
that we are privileged to see what
must be a typical Elsa Maxwell
party, the plot could easily dispense
with her. Charlie Ruggles handles
| his usual befuddled character role
i well as Penny's uncle-guardian and
| president of Cooper Soup.
STEREOTYPED PATTERN
IL happens so often in Hollywood
that audiences have probably com
placently accustomed themselves to
movies with unnatural endings, in
which the ending does not logically
follow from what has gone before.
Instead, everyone changes charac
ter or else an accident interferes
with the natural consequences of
the hero's (in this case the heroine's)
actions and one goes, home either
satisfied that everyone in the play
was spared or unsatisfied because
[ the conclusion was false.
"Public Deb No. 1" doesn't de
viate from the stereotyped pattern
and this reviewer has little hope that
many motion picures will in the
near future. The more unnatural
• endings one sees, the more accus
tomed one becomes to them, and we
ail dislike to have anything we are
accustomed to changed. Thus we
j find ourselves in a vicious circle —
