# Row Delegates Hear Wilbur Stress Need for Leadership
## 
### 
There are too many "club loafers" in Stanford fraternities who are just
wasting their time, President Ray Lyman Wilbur told the second annual
Interfraternity Conference at its banquet in Union dining hall last night.
Sparking the 70 officers, representing over 800 fraternity men, to
alleviate this situation, Dr. Wilbur emphasized:

"The fraternity chapter
upon just one thing—leadership, 1
active leadership."
George Whistler, president of the \
Interfraternity Alumni Conference,
and Dean of Men John Bunn also
spoke.
Previous to the concluding ban
quet house managers, rushing chair
men, and the Interfraternity Coun
cil, composed of house presidents,
held separate meetings to foresee
the year's problems and provide an
ounce of prevention.
HOUSE PRESIDENTS
MEETING
Fraternity scholarship average for J
last year was higher than that in any j
of the past three years, and aver- i
ages of 12 out of the 24 Stanford
fraternities was above the Univer
sity average, Dean Bunn told the j
house presidents' meeting before
dinner.
Suggestions for improving sopho- j
more scholarship were discussed.
Pete Whittlesey, Interfraternity
president who presided at the house
presidents' meeting and the banquet, j
announced the publication of the
first Stanford Interfraternity Maga- !
zine, edited by Bob Plate and Har
old Shafer, to be distributed to the '
i'rosh Nov. 4.
RUSH CHAIRMEN'S
MEETING
Thus far, Stanford has a clean j
slate filed in the office of Edwin Ath- I
erton, czar of the Coast Conference. I
To protect this record, Professor j
William B. Owens has warned Stan- j
ford's 24 fraternities not to contact !
any prospective athlete before he en- j
ters the University.
At a meeting of the rush chair
men yesterday, Bill Weeden, Inter
fraternity Council secretary, ex
plained the new "Petrovich law" as
follows:
"Unless the man is a personal
friend of one of the fellows in the i
house, you can't have him up to the
house or entertain him in any way,
and violation of this rule would
mean loss of eligibility for the ath
lete."
HOUSE MANAGERS'
MEETING
Dean Bunn addressed house man
agers on the subject of scholarship,
putting it on a dollars and cents j
basis:
"Since the membership of a fra
ternity seriously affects its financial
conditions, a good studying environ
ment in the house means a great
deal to the house manager.
Jud Crary, ex-offieio member of
the Interfraternity Board of Control
Finance Committee, said:
"We have found that there are
two reasons for a house failing in
finances. They are: (1) lack of ade
quate membership, and (2) failure 1
of the house manager to collect
from the members."

wasting their time, President Ray Lyman Wilbur told the second annual
Interfraternity Conference at its banquet in Union dining hall last night.
Sparking the 70 officers, representing over 800 fraternity men, to
alleviate this situation, Dr. Wilbur emphasized:

"The fraternity chapter
upon just one thing—leadership, 1
active leadership."
George Whistler, president of the \
Interfraternity Alumni Conference,
and Dean of Men John Bunn also
spoke.
Previous to the concluding ban
quet house managers, rushing chair
men, and the Interfraternity Coun
cil, composed of house presidents,
held separate meetings to foresee
the year's problems and provide an
ounce of prevention.
HOUSE PRESIDENTS
MEETING
Fraternity scholarship average for J
last year was higher than that in any j
of the past three years, and aver- i
ages of 12 out of the 24 Stanford
fraternities was above the Univer
sity average, Dean Bunn told the j
house presidents' meeting before
dinner.
Suggestions for improving sopho- j
more scholarship were discussed.
Pete Whittlesey, Interfraternity
president who presided at the house
presidents' meeting and the banquet, j
announced the publication of the
first Stanford Interfraternity Maga- !
zine, edited by Bob Plate and Har
old Shafer, to be distributed to the '
i'rosh Nov. 4.
RUSH CHAIRMEN'S
MEETING
Thus far, Stanford has a clean j
slate filed in the office of Edwin Ath- I
erton, czar of the Coast Conference. I
To protect this record, Professor j
William B. Owens has warned Stan- j
ford's 24 fraternities not to contact !
any prospective athlete before he en- j
ters the University.
At a meeting of the rush chair
men yesterday, Bill Weeden, Inter
fraternity Council secretary, ex
plained the new "Petrovich law" as
follows:
"Unless the man is a personal
friend of one of the fellows in the i
house, you can't have him up to the
house or entertain him in any way,
and violation of this rule would
mean loss of eligibility for the ath
lete."
HOUSE MANAGERS'
MEETING
Dean Bunn addressed house man
agers on the subject of scholarship,
putting it on a dollars and cents j
basis:
"Since the membership of a fra
ternity seriously affects its financial
conditions, a good studying environ
ment in the house means a great
deal to the house manager.
Jud Crary, ex-offieio member of
the Interfraternity Board of Control
Finance Committee, said:
"We have found that there are
two reasons for a house failing in
finances. They are: (1) lack of ade
quate membership, and (2) failure 1
of the house manager to collect
from the members."
There are too many "club loafers" in Stanford fraternities who are just
wasting their time, President Ray Lyman Wilbur told the second annual
Interfraternity Conference at its banquet in Union dining hall last night.
Sparking the 70 officers, representing over 800 fraternity men, to
