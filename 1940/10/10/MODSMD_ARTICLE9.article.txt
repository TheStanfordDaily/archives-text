DEFENSE WORK IN LABS
Appointment by Turner of mem
bers to this emergency committee
will be made at an early date, it
was indicated. In this inventory
taking, the student committee will
be advised by a similar organization
of the Stanford faculty, which is
headed by Dean Samuel B. Morris
of the School of Engineering.
"We shall try to determine the va
riety and extent of scientific and
technical knowledge and ability
among Stanford students which they
may be able to devote to the na
tions defense," Turner said.
Several members of the faculty
already are on active duty with the
army and navy, while others arc at
work on the Farm's scientific labora
tories on national defense projects.
