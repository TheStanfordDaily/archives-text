Direct as a "touchdown pass" is the campus-to-home
laundry service offered by RAILWAY EXPRESS. We
call for your laundry, take it home... and then bring
it back to you at your college address. It's as quick
and convenient as that! You may send your laundry
prepaid or collect, as you prefer.
Low rates include calling for and delivering in all cities
and principal towns. Use RAILWAY EXPRESS, too, for
swift shipment of all packages and luggage. Just phone
