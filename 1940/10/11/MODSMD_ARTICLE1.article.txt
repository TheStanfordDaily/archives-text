VV/AR in the Balkans seemed im
minent last night as reports
from Bucharest and Belgrade con
tinued to tell of heavy Nazi troop
movements along the Danube and in
Rumania.
Great Britain is on the verge of
breaking off diplomatic relations
with Rumania, according to rumors
circulating in London. The British
have had no reply to their note ask
ing the Rumanian government for
"elucidation" of German troop
movements in that country.
In the Rumanian capital the
British legation was reported to be
turning its secret diplomatic docu
ments in anticipation of the break
ing off of relations with Rumania.
No oilicial statement or even ac
knowledgment of Nazi trops in Ru
mania came from Berlin. The Ger
mans only boasted of their bomb
ing raids over the British Isles.
Germans in the Rumanian capital
described Nazi troops there as
merely "training units" invited to
reorganize the Rumanian army.
They insisted that Germany was go
ing to take every precaution to safe
guard Rumanian oil fields and trans
portation centers. Nazi officials in
Bucharest suggested that German
troops might likewise be sent to
Hungary and Bulgaria.
In addition to the announcement
in Washington of huge new de
fense plans, it was disclosed that
Rumanian assets in the United
States were to be "frozen." Such a
move in Washington served to lend
credence to the London rumors
that Britain was about to split
with Rumania. The United States
took the "freezing step" when the
Germans invaded France, Holland,
Belgium, Norway, and Denmark.

lAPANESE officials suddenly
" changed their tone yesterday and
Foreign Minister Matsuoka made a
speech that sounded like a plea for
the United States to stay out of the
conflict in Europe or in the Far East.
Observers in the United States were
undecided as to the significance of
the new Japanese attitude. Ameri
cans could not be expected to forget
overnight belilgerent statements
coming from Tokyo during the past
few weeks. Premier Konoye, who
made the "fight to a finish" declara
tions, is still head of the Japanese
government.
Assassination of the Japanese
appointed mayor of Shanghai was
reported early this morning and
Japanese military authorities imme
diately spread terror through Chi
nese quarters in the settlement as
they searched for the slayer.
Rome newspapers emphasized their
allegiance to the pact with Japan
and Tokyo, as Italian troop move
ments were reported along the Yugo
slav frontier.

yk/ITH such ominous news from
the major capitals of the world
yesterday, it appeared that a new
Axis campaign was on. Predictions
as to the next Axis move varied
considerably. Obviously, Rumania is
no longer an independent nation.
Before long she will be reduced to
the status of other Nazi-conquered
European states. Here agreement
ends.
Some speculated 011 an Axis
squeeze on Yugoslavia with the
Rumanian invasion merely a move
to divert attention, somewhat
similar to the invasion of Norway
preliminary to the attack 011 the
Lowland countries. Others con
sidered the possibility of a major
campaign to seize the Dardcncllcs.
As 011 so many past occasions, the
world will not know until the Nazis
strike.

yjILITARY maneuvers in Africa
are apparently in progress with
General De Gaulle leading the "free
French" forces and former Allied
Commander-in-Chief Weygand lead
ing the opposing troops loyal to the
Vichy government.
British warships are reported
blockading three French colonial
ports on the West Coast which have
not broken with the Vichy regime,
and the De Gaulle units are believed
to have landed in order to lay seige
to one or more of the ports by land.
