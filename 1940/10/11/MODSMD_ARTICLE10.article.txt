# Card Travelers Record Unique Oriental Crisis
## 
### JANET GOULD 
An international chess game with
unknown rules is combining with
human frailty to give Japan a unique
position in the world crisis, declared
Kay Kitigawa, '42, who with Hugh
O'Donnell, '41, spent the summer in
Japan, Manchukuo, and Korea with
other members of Stanford's dele
gation to the Seventh America-
Japan Student Conference.
"The spiritual purpose behind
Japan's government, its caring noth
ing for outside influence, and its
rationalizations for its policy give
the country an aloneness which no
other power possesses," Kitigawa
said.
THE MERRY CREW
Ned Pugh was chairman for the 58
American delegation guests of the
Japanese students, and O'Donnell
was treasurer ("He collected boat
fares," Kitigawa grinned). Other
delegates from Stanford were Bill
Turner, Roy Vitousek, Jack Calder
wood, Marlyn Whedon, Nat Brown,
and Virginia McCloskey.
"Anyone who claims the confer
ence is an outlet for Japanese propa
ganda gets an emphatic 'No!' " O'-
Donnell said.
With the decks cleared for action
by declaring that they were unable
to gauge public opinion accurately,
and that they were not in Japan
when the Axis combine was fer
menting, Kitagawa tucked up the
cuffs of his blue sweater and pre
pared to discuss "the difference in
color patterns."
VERY INTERESTING
"Oh, this is interesting, very in
teresting, he said. "The Japanese
believe that their cause is sacred,
and some think that since 1905
America has been harassing Japan
as a meddler and selfish barrier, and
that the militarist-totalitarianism is
justified.
"I talked to cafe waitresses, taxi
driver, beer delivery boys. From
my limited observations I think that
the 'man on the street' is not con
cerned with pros and cons of the
Axis, with the anti-British senti
ment or the equally strong pro-
German tee ling, as much as he wants
to see the 'China incident' through.
WANT FRIENDSHIP
"America? I think that paradoxi
cally enough the Japanese want
American friendship, if only for eco
nomic reasons. But they feel that
j they have a light to their own Mon
roe doctrine in the Far East."
The delegates traveled into Man-
J chukuo and Korea, and spent an
i agonizing night in the second-class
hold of a passenger steamer. They
' were on the same trains with sol
diers wounded at the battle fronts,
l and they watched troops marching
j off to war with flag and band ac
; companiment.
"In Manchukuo," O'Donnell de
[ clared, "you hear constantly about
the way the Japanese have put the
i country on the map. Well, they
have—economically. There is the
largest open coal mine in the world
there, but the people are in the
| same muck and mire as they were
before. Yet 1 believe that the Japa
-1 nese have the raising of the standard

of living at heart."
STUDENT PROBLEM
Points of agreement between Kita
gawa's and O'Donnell's impressions
were that there was a censorship of
news, although the students' con
ferences were free; that the average
students try to justify the actions
of their leaders, regardless; and that
Japan was facing a tremendous job
in her fight for expansion and her
effort to do away with a strongly
anti-Japanese faction at her back
door.
Concerning the newer develop
ments of the Far Eastern crisis since
the return of the delegation to
America, O'Donnell declined to
comment. Kitagawa, who spent
three weeks longer in Japan than
the rest of the party, returned with
impressions which he declared were
"subjective and making no claim to
being formal analyses."
"I believe that Konoye and Mat
suoka are very popular," he said.
As for war with the United States,
Kitagawa declared that from what
he had seen during his stay, and
what he had heard from the "man
on the street, it is "entirely unlikely
—at this point."
