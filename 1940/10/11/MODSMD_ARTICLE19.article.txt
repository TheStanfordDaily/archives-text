# Big Red Machine Shifts Into High For Season's Crucial Bronc Struggle
## Indians Poise for Annual Grudge Battle with Tricky Santa Clara Grid Club; Strategy Important 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Stanford's annual grudge hat tie tomorrow with those neighboring Santa
Clara Broncos is going to he largely a duel of strategy between two of
the best football heads in the country.
Tomorrow's game has been won and lost on paper a hundred times in
the last week by both Stanford's Coach Clark Shaughncssy and Santa

Clara's Buck Shaw. Out on the field
tomorrow modern football will reach
a height in variations and trickery
on both offense and defense.
But more than just smart coach
ing is going to be evident when these
surprising Indians attempt to stop
the Sugar Bowl-bound Broncs;
there are going to be a lot of sweet
football players in action.
Look for fireworks when such
backs as Stanford's Norm Standlee,
Frankie Albert, Pete Kmetovic, and
Hugh Gallarneau match their
weapons with those of Santa Clara's
Jimmy Johnson, John Hanna, Ward
Heiser, and Les Palm, and when the
Cards' soph linemen Bruno Ban
ducci and Chuck Taylor tangle with
the Bronco tackles Bill Beggs and
Bill Braan.

To an outsider it would look as
though Coach Clark Shaughnessy
and his varsity footballers had ev
erything to gain and nothing to lose
in tomorrow's tilt. True, it wouldn't
be too much of a disgrace losing to
a team as good as the Shawmen and
the Cards' Rose Bowl record would
not be badly impaired.
But still fresh on the minds of
many of the Indians is the memory
of last year's brutal 27-7 beating
and that 22-0 affair of the year be
fore. Unable to match the Broncos
since the days of the Vowing Sopho
mores, Stanford is hungry for a
victory over the boys from down
San Jose way.
SEEK PRESTIGE
Just as important in the minds of
the players as the element of re
venge is the boost in national pres
tige for the team and success in this
battle of wits for their coach that
a win over Santa Clara could bring.
Behind the shelter of its practice
field fence, Shaughnessy & Co. was
cooking up a defense yesterday to
stop the rampaging Broncos. The
Cards spent most of the afternoon
rehearsing their various defensive
formations and gave but little tim
to their already polished offense.
Dark spot on the horizon yester
day was the latest addition to the
injury list, Jack Francis. Jack was
slated to start Saturday's game at
the guard spot and still Ls, if his
sprained ankle, which kept him in
street clothes yesterday, is strong
enough by game time.
PALMER IS BACK
With Francis on the sidelines, big
Dick Palmer moved back into his
old berth on the first string, calling
the defensive signals as he has done
in the last two games.
One encouraging bit of news con
cerning the list of cripples was that
Bill Willard, veteran end, was able
to scrimmage Thursday with his
trick knee in a brace and will be in
shape to relieve those ends who are
going to get quite a workout to
morrow.
There is sure to be some more
unveiling of the mysterious Shaugh
nessy offense. In their first two
games, Shaughnessy's boys used a
rneaguer 14 plays to come through
with two victories. But because the
Cards value so highly a win over
the Broncs, Shaughnessy will not
make much of an attempt to keep
his offense hidden from the prying
eye - of Coast Conference scouts.
BACKITELI) GROWS
Witii "Chief" Standlee graduating
into the ranks of triple threat ar
tists with his two perfect pitches
last week, the Card backfield now
has two passers. And Norm and the
deadly Frankie Albert are sure to
do a iot of tossing to their speedy
< rids and halfbacks.
Buck Shaw's backs are sure to
do their share of passing, for their
; erial attack was largely responsible
for their 9-6 win over U.C.L.A. last
\veek-end. Johnson and Dick Clark
will do the passing for the Broncos.
Manna, Santa Clara's starting full
hack, and Kenny Casanega, second
string half, are probably Shaw's
hardest runners, but neither carries
the terrific crashing of Stanford's
SU-ncliee.
sr.WDLI.F'S MATCH?
In the kicking department, John
on is supposed to be able to almost
match Standlee for distance and
has an added advantage with his
ability to hit the coffin corner.
Another department of the game
in which the two teams will be al
most a stand-off will be speed. Clark,
Johnson, Heiser and Harry Saunders
are all very fast and will match the
wiftness of the Card speedsters,
Kmetovic, Gallarneau, Eric Arm
strong and A1 Cole.
For real tricky running as well
as speed, Santa Clara's Saunde, who
brought back a Utah punt 75 yards
to a touchdown, and Stanford's
Midget' A1 Cole, who ran his team
mates ragged this week in practice
crimmages, ought to give the crowd
their money's worth of thrills if
cither of them gets away.
The Broncs have a couple of tack
les, Bill Beggs and Bill Br aun,
whom they are booming for All —
Const, nt least, who ought to give
those sophomore linemen, Palmer,
I'.inducci and Taylor, the toughest
t< .■( of their short varsity careers.
