# Air Defense Units Rushed To Islands
## Roosevelt Outlines Mass Calisthenics Plan for Americans 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 10 (UP).—
The army and navy today rushed
of the nation's air,
sea and land defenses as Presi
dent Roosevelt mapped a volun
tary program to "toughen up
America" physically.
Government defense and labor
agencies worked on plans to spread
out the supply of skilled defense
workers.
SEVEN DEVELOPMENTS
High spots in the day's defense
developments:
I—War Secretary Henry L. Stim
son disclosed the 251 st Coast Artil
lery anti-aircraft regiment of the
California National Guard will go J
to Hawaii within a few weeks to
strengthen anti-aircraft defenses
there. He would not say whether
the move is concerned with devel
opments in the Far East.
2—Stimson also announced a |
new three-man Mmy mission is
en route to London to study Brit
ish air defenses against the Ger
man attack.
.'s—The War Department, mov
ing to speed up production of
21,000 army warplancs, asked the
17 aircraft companies working on
army contracts to go on 24-hour
shifts.
4—The navy ordered all ground
units of the organized Marine Corps j
Reserve—about 200 officers and 5,500
men—to report for duty "on or
about Nov. 7." The order apparently
will affect the President's eldest son,
James Roosevelt, who holds a cap
tain's commission in the reserves.
s—The army virtually completed
the reorganization of administrative
and supply command in the nine
corps areas.
(i—Mr. Roosevelt approved the
broad outlines of a plan to build
up Americans through physical
exercise and organized calisthen
ics. He will call a conference of
physical educators and medical
and dental experts after the No
vember elections to draw up such
a program, which will be volun
tary in every detail.
7—Conscription officials, the Labor
Department, the joint Army-Navy
Munitions Board and the Federal
Security Administration were said
to be working on plans to encourage
skilled defense workers to move
from areas where surpluses of such
manpower exist to other localities
where there are shortages.
Stimson, announcing a new army i
mission is en route to London, said
it would "observe and make a study
of the defense being put up by
Great Britain against air attack and
would acquire information of great
value to us."
UNDERGROUND AIRDROMES
Asked if the army is studying
underground airdromes as a result
of the European war, Stimson said
these plans are under consideration,
but declined to reveal the extent of
the studies.
He said plans to send a National
Guard regiment to Hawaii consti
tute a further step to strengthen the
Hawaiian garrison of 24.000 men.
Additional reinforcements are prob
able, he said.
The projected program to "tough
en up America" was disclosed after
Mr. Roosevelt conferred with John
B. Kelly, Fhiladelphian who twice
won the Olympic sculling cham- |
pionship.
Such a program would be super- 1
vised from Washington by Kelly but
its actual administration would be
handled by community groups.
Kelly said the ultimate objective
would be to devise a plan to build
1 up "national stamina from the bot
tom up" by every form of group and
individual exercise in which people
j can be persuaded to participate.
WORKERS' LOANS
Proposed plans to spread out the
j supply of skilled defense workers
contemplate advancing loans to men
' who cannot afford to pay moving
i charges. Such workers would be
i more likely to receive draft defer
ments than if they remained in ar* v
\ where their skill was no longer
I needed.
Conscription officials men
in ordinary occupations to "stay put"
and not seek jobs in defense indus
tries. They said men who take jobs
in defense industries now actually
might run a greater chance of being
drafted than if they remained in
other lines of work
