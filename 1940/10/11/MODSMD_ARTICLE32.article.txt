# Stanford Men Eligible For Draft May Be Able To Register on Campus
## Farm National Emergency Council Discusses Possible Formation Of Naval R.O.T.C. Unit on Campus 
### 
Inference (hat Stanford men eligible for draft registration may lie able
to register at a special otlice on the campus next Wednesday, Octobr 1(».
was made last night hy Bill Turner, head of the newly formed Stanford
National Emergency Committee.
While expressing the hope that such on-campus registration will prove
possible, Turner revealed that the first day's work as head of this commit- j

tee had shown him that even local <
draft officials remain much "in the
dark" as to the actual procedure of
registration.
"There is much for us to learn,"
he said, "but nowhere to learn it.
Even local officials are not clear as
to the details of next Wednesday's
draft registration."
Hope was expressed, however,
that many now missing details would .
be cleared up by extensive work
over the week-end.
Only major question which ap
peared solved was the time ques
tion of classification under the
clauses of the draft act. Next Wed
nesday will be set aside solely for
registration, with the problems of
classification and exemptions coming
at a later date.
TAKES SHORT TIME
Registration is expected to neces
sitate only between 20 and 30 min
utes' time for each person.
Turner added that should on
campus drait registration be pos
sible it would not include students
whose voting precinct is Santa Clara
County. These students will regis
ter with the local draft board, he
said.
One more duty was added to the
committee's three-point program
with the discussion of possibilities of
formation of a Naval R.O.T.C. branch
on the campus before spring.
UNDER DISCUSSION
"No definite statement on this is
possible at this time," Turner ex
plained. "The matter has been very
seriously discussed, however."
The three earlier points of the
committee's slate included: (1) pro
viding information to the 1,750 eli
gible Stanford men relative to the
problems of actual registration; (2)
determination of scientific and tech
nical knowledge through which
Farm men may better fit themselves
for a part in the national defense;
and (.')) co-operation with the simi
lar committee of the Stanford fac
ulty, headed by Dean Samuel B.
Morris of the School of Engineering.
AND THEN
The greatest duties of the commit
tee may come after actual registra
tion has been completed, Turner
said. He stressed the importance of
the committee's work of better fit
ting Stanford men along lines which
will prove valuable should they be
called for military training.
Announcement of committee
members will be made Monday,
Turner expected.

that many now missing details would .
be cleared up by extensive work
over the week-end.
Only major question which ap
peared solved was the time ques
tion of classification under the
clauses of the draft act. Next Wed
nesday will be set aside solely for
registration, with the problems of
classification and exemptions coming
at a later date.
TAKES SHORT TIME
Registration is expected to neces
sitate only between 20 and 30 min
utes' time for each person.
Turner added that should on
campus drait registration be pos
sible it would not include students
whose voting precinct is Santa Clara
County. These students will regis
ter with the local draft board, he
said.
One more duty was added to the
committee's three-point program
with the discussion of possibilities of
formation of a Naval R.O.T.C. branch
on the campus before spring.
UNDER DISCUSSION
"No definite statement on this is
possible at this time," Turner ex
plained. "The matter has been very
seriously discussed, however."
The three earlier points of the
committee's slate included: (1) pro
viding information to the 1,750 eli
gible Stanford men relative to the
problems of actual registration; (2)
determination of scientific and tech
nical knowledge through which
Farm men may better fit themselves
for a part in the national defense;
and (.')) co-operation with the simi
lar committee of the Stanford fac
ulty, headed by Dean Samuel B.
Morris of the School of Engineering.
AND THEN
The greatest duties of the commit
tee may come after actual registra
tion has been completed, Turner
said. He stressed the importance of
the committee's work of better fit
ting Stanford men along lines which
will prove valuable should they be
called for military training.
Announcement of committee
members will be made Monday,
Turner expected.

to register at a special otlice on the campus next Wednesday, Octobr 1(».
was made last night hy Bill Turner, head of the newly formed Stanford
National Emergency Committee.
While expressing the hope that such on-campus registration will prove
possible, Turner revealed that the first day's work as head of this commit- j

tee had shown him that even local <
draft officials remain much "in the
dark" as to the actual procedure of
registration.
"There is much for us to learn,"
he said, "but nowhere to learn it.
Even local officials are not clear as
to the details of next Wednesday's
draft registration."
