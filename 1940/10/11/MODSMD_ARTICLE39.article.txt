# On The Political Front
## Roosevelt: Willkie: 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 10 (UP).—Ed
ward J. Flynn, chairman of the
Democratic National Committee,
took issue today with Wendell Will
kie's defense of the Republican
Party as an "enemy of monopoly"
and linked the G.O.P. under earlier
administrations to monopolistic
practices, especially in the public
utility indusries.
Answering Mr. Willkie's ani-mo
nopoly remarks at New Haven yes
terday, Flynn said:
' I suppose that the G.O.P. was an
enemy of monopoly when Samuel
Insull, through his pyramid of hold
ing companies, was the czar of power
and light over an enormous terri
tory and when Willkie's Common
wealth and Southern Corp. followed
close in the footsteps of that 'force
ful, dynamic and attractive figure'—
to use Mr. Willkie's own descrip
tion of Mr. Insull.
Flynn announced that Candidate
Roosevelt would leave his Presiden
tial duties for a two-day tour of
Ohio and Pennsylvania, swinging
through the industrial districts prior
to making his summary speech next
week.

TRACK, PAWTUCKET, R.1., Oct.
10 (UP). —Wendell L. Willkie to
night painted a picture of a new
America so great "50 years from
now we may scarcely be able to
recognize the new world that we
are about to build."
But that new world, he added,
cannot be created if the New Deal
"prophets of despair" are returned
to power. It can be built, he said,
only if a Republican administration
is elected to "set free the energies
fo our people, to eliminate as much
as possible the red tape, the fric
tion, the unscientific taxes, and
above all the philosophy that men
are better off on a government pay
roll than they are on a private pay
roll.
The Republican candidate spoke
here after an automobile tour of
Rhode Island during which he told
thousands of persons in the commu
nities he visited that President Roo
sevelt and his aides had "bungled
our international affairs as they
have our domestic affairs."
Bloodhounds, instead of being fe
rocious, bloodthirsty beasts, are do
cile and affectionate.

Roosevelt would leave his Presiden
tial duties for a two-day tour of
Ohio and Pennsylvania, swinging
through the industrial districts prior
to making his summary speech next
week.

TRACK, PAWTUCKET, R.1., Oct.
10 (UP). —Wendell L. Willkie to
night painted a picture of a new
America so great "50 years from
now we may scarcely be able to
recognize the new world that we
are about to build."
But that new world, he added,
cannot be created if the New Deal
"prophets of despair" are returned
to power. It can be built, he said,
only if a Republican administration
is elected to "set free the energies
fo our people, to eliminate as much
as possible the red tape, the fric
tion, the unscientific taxes, and
above all the philosophy that men
are better off on a government pay
roll than they are on a private pay
roll.
The Republican candidate spoke
here after an automobile tour of
Rhode Island during which he told
thousands of persons in the commu
nities he visited that President Roo
sevelt and his aides had "bungled
our international affairs as they
have our domestic affairs."
Bloodhounds, instead of being fe
rocious, bloodthirsty beasts, are do
cile and affectionate.
NEW YORK, Oct. 10 (UP).—Ed
ward J. Flynn, chairman of the
Democratic National Committee,
took issue today with Wendell Will
kie's defense of the Republican
Party as an "enemy of monopoly"
and linked the G.O.P. under earlier
administrations to monopolistic
practices, especially in the public
utility indusries.
Answering Mr. Willkie's ani-mo
nopoly remarks at New Haven yes
terday, Flynn said:
' I suppose that the G.O.P. was an
enemy of monopoly when Samuel
Insull, through his pyramid of hold
ing companies, was the czar of power
and light over an enormous terri
tory and when Willkie's Common
wealth and Southern Corp. followed
close in the footsteps of that 'force
ful, dynamic and attractive figure'—
to use Mr. Willkie's own descrip
tion of Mr. Insull.
