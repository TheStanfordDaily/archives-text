## Causes Laid to Fear; Reading Inability Is Principal Factor 
### 
To sublimate problems too big to
handle, Dr. Mary I. Preston of Stan
ford University declares that Amer
ican students are inclined to need
lessly handicap themselves by con
tracting imaginary illnesses.
To prove her statement, she cites
the cases of 100 children in whom
no evidence of physical illness could
be discovered, but who constantly
complained of stomach ache, head
ache, dizziness, heart flutter, and
other common ailments.
In each case the child seemed to
be fighting a losing battle against
some worry, fear, or adversity en
countered in school, at home, or in
social relations.
Failure to keep up in reading was
one of the principal factors. This
failure was due in many cases to
the use of a single rather than a
combination method of teaching
reading. This single method is the
sight or "look-say" method, and
fails to help '.hose whose hearing
is relatively better than their sight.
• The result of this "single" method
is that printed words fail to regis
ter sufficiently on their mentality,
and Ihey do not get the full mean
ing of phrases or sentences. The
combination method, says Dr. Pres
ton, meets the needs of all pupils.
