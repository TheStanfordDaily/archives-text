# Papooses Bump Ucla Tomorrow
## Coach Lauds Well-Stocked Frosh Eleven 
### DON SELBY 
After an early afternoon chalk
talk followed by a light practice
session, Stanford's 1940 frosh grid
ders will entrain tonight for Los
Angeles where they will take on
the University of California at
Los Angeles freshmen tomorrow
afternoon in the Coliseum. The
game will he a preliminary to the
U.C.L.A. varsity-Texas A. & M.
contest.
In their last heavy workout this
week, Coach Harry Shipkey's
charges went through a thorough
offensive drill yesterday afternoon
with particular stress on their pass
ing attack. Under the watchful eyes
of Shipkey and his assistants, Bones
Hamilton, Bob Dakan, and Jens
Bugge, the yearlings ran through
their entire repertoire of ground
plays and then followed up with a
hot session of aerial drill.
Right halfback Bob Koch looked
particularly good on the throwing
end of the aerials, while Jim Ellis
and Bill Brubaker showed that they
knew how to snag the passes. An
other end, Bill Wilson, who has
been kept on the sidelines by a leg
injury, was also on the receiving
end of a good many tosses.
PRESSING RESERVES
Although Shipkey hasn't too
many reserves, those that he does
have are right in there pressing for
a starting position. As Assistant
Coach Bones Hamilton puts it:
"About half of the first two teams
can be interchanged without weak
ening the team as a whole."
From the Southland comes word
that frosh mentors Oster, Frawley,
and Washington have been giving
their charges a good deal of funda
mental drill in preparation for this
Saturday's contest. And it is to be
expected that the Bruin Cubs will
field a much stronger team tomor
iow than (hey-did last year.
U.C.L.A. LINE-UP
The Uelans will line up for the
starting kick-off something like this:
Ed Breeding, Ed Pannel, Rex Ox
lord, Jim Chandler, Morris Harri
son, Ted Obidine, and Burr Bald
win in the line, and George Phil
lips, Hubert Duke, A1 Solari, and
Harrison Carter in the backfield.
It seems quite likely that the
southern boys on the Stanford frosh
will get an opportunity to strut iheir
stuft before their hometown folks
tomorrow. And most of them are
more than a little determined to do
just that. Frank Forbes, diminutive
left half, has taken over-a first team
spot, and may remind the fans that
lie played some fancy ball down
their way a couple of years ago.
If the Papoose eleven gets by the
U.C.L.A. boys tomorrow afternoon,
they will have taken one step on
their way to another "little four"
championship, which they won last
in 1D.»8. It will probably be tough
going, especially if it is as hot in
the Coliseum as it was when last
year's frosh played U.S.C. frosh
there; but Shipkey's boys are out
Jifter a win and may be able to turn
the trick by a good margin.
