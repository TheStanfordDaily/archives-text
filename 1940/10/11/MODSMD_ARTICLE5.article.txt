# Rallyers Raise Roof as Gang Spurs Team to Tame Broncos
## 
### CHARLES BULL 
The band blared. The crowd yelled. And all together enough spirit
was generated to really tame (not KONKO) that Prune Valley Bronco
who plans to invade the Stanford Farm tomorrow.
A gang of 2,500 rooters tendered a roaring ovation to Head Gridman
Clark Shaughnessy on his entrance, and rent the rafters with an enthu-

j siastic Coach Yell at the
of his quiet but confident talk.
The headman had one request to
make of his team: "Will you please j
refrain from getting in a hole dur- I
ing the first two or three minutes of j
play?"
But in giving the boys of the Red j
Machine a bit of praise, he said, 1
"They just get better when they
I get in trouble anyway."
PREXY ON HANI)
Head Yell Leader Gordy Nicoll I
introduced Pat McGarry, the
smooth-looking student body proxy
from Santa Clara who told the gang,
"There is every reason to expect the
finest in hard, close, spirited foot
ball in Stanford Stadium this Sat- j
urday."
His exit was waggishly heralded j
with the cry, "Go get him, Roble!"
Try as Rally Committee could
they couldn't keep out a couple of
drunken, hayseed yell leaders,
strangely resembling Tony Ccfa
ratti and Harry Dyck, under the
leadership of Ted Doe, who wowed
the crowd with their rough and
tumble antics.
TAP FEET
Feet were set to tapping when
Tray Galliano took the piano keys
for a ride with some of his original
hot boogie-woogie.
Feeling that the band, which
wisely has stayed away from swing
this year, was in line for a little
commendation from the student
body, Nicoll introduced the four men
behind the band who make things
tick.
MEN TAKE BOW
They are Charles Bubb, director; l
Dave Ingram, drum major; Jack
Hedden, librarian; and Jack Ed
munds, manager.
The rally was brought to an
eventful close with a peppy band
rendition and community sing of
the old standby "Come Join the
Band."
