# Tech Tackles Fighting Irish

CHICAGO. Oct. 10 (UP).—Foot
ball upsets are planned in advance
and two are brewing in the Mid
west today that may knock the
props from under the two best
bets for national football honors
—Notre Dame and Ohio State.
If the upsets miss fire, none will
be the wiser. Northwestern figures
to lose to Ohio State, and Notre
Dame power outweighs Georgia
Tech skill. The underdogs can take
their lickings and you'll hear, "Ho,
hum, another in the bag" from the
assembled celebrants in downtown
South Bend and on High Street in
Columbus, O.
But Elmer Lay den of Notre Dame
figures this "ho hum" business has
set in a few days too early.
Seventeen' Notre Dame playei's of
the 1939 squad that squeezed out a
17 to 14 victory over Georgia Tech
have left the campus, and 19 Tech
sters are back for another crack.
Despite its narrow escape against
underrated Purdue, Ohio State still
ranks as the Big Ten's best bet.
With only one dependable line,
Northwestern has been forced to
I change its defensive tactics in an
effort tc combat Ohio State's still
I unused razzle-dazzle.
