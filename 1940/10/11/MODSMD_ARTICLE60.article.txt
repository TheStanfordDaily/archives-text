'LARK SHAUGHNESSY isn't
shedding 100 many tears over
the tact that the Indians will be 10-7
underdogs when they lace the high
flying Broncos in the Stadium to
morrow afternoon. If those odds
have the same effect on the Stan
ford linemen as they did in the
U.S.F. tilt, Buck Shaw's proteges
will be in for a very tough after
noon.
It's an old axiom of football that
the team with the hardest charging
line wins the ball game. Split sec
onds count as touchdowns when the
ball is snapped and the forward
walls meet.
The sophomore Indian linemen,
if they show the fire they did
against the Dons, will stall the
vaunted Santa Clara offense and
give their own backs a chance to
break loose. Aiding the Stanford
front ranks will be several defen
sive formations cooked up by
Coach Shaughnessy to confuse the
Bronco blocking assignments.

- HORSES and other
minor injuries suffered, by sev
eral first-stringers may give the
Shaughnessymen a good deal of
trouble. Most of the squad is in
shape to play, but some key men
missed the important practice ses
sions this week in which the brains
department told the squad how
they were going to beat Shaw &
Co."
The Santa Clara squad was re
ported in bad shape because of in
juries at the start of the week, but
now it turns out that things in the
Bronco camp aren't as black as they
were painted. It. looks as though
Buck Shaw were planning on slip
ping in a sleeper or two. The Prune
ville coaching staff" announced that
Bill Beggs. regular tackle, would not
play Saturday at the same time the
medicos were pronouncing him O.K.
for action.

ONE0 NE thing is a cinch, the Shaw
men aren't overrated. Buck
Shaw teams never are. Another
thing you can bet your grandmoth
er's cigarette stock on is that the
Broncs will turn in their best game
of the season tomorrow.
The Santa Ciarans always seem
fo reach their peak against Stan
ford, and with fine gridders three
deep in every position, that peak
will be very good.
They were a classy ball club when
we saw them waltz through Utah in
the opener, and they haven't been
loafing in the two weeks since that
occasion. One consolation for Farm
rooters, however, lies in the fact
that there wasn't much room for
improvements.
Their main weakness seems to be
on defense. The two Utah 1 allies;
have often been discredited because
the Bronco reserves were in at the
time, but the UX.L.A. touchdown
last Friday can't be laughed off.
An occurrence in connection
with (hat Bruin score may point
to the outcome of tomorrow's
battle.
Santa Clara led fi-0. had just
stalled off a Ucla scoring threat, the
Southerners had the ball in the vi

cinity of the,2o-yard line.
The play started out as the old
Robinson reverse, with Bartlett in
the running role. The Bronc defense
saw it coming and moved in to stop
the ball carrier, but Bartlett Inter
filed to Ned Matthews, who went to
the 2-yard line.
Santa Clara will see a lot of
laterals tomorrow, and they'll
also see a lot of variations of the
Stanford plays they have scouted.
