# Card Splashers Hope to Draw Compton Blood
## 
### 
The Card water polo varsity ,
takes to the water this afternoon
in Encina Pool against Compton
Junior College in a game follow
ing the 3:15 o'clock preliminary
between the Farm Junior Varsity
and the Compton Reserves.
Gaining much valuable experience
against strong competition this past
week, the varsity promises to even
up its win-lose ledger, which now
stands one victory, two defeats.
COMPTON STRONG
Compton is reported having a
strong aggregation, composed of
former Southern Cal ace swimmers.
Nevertheless, the fine showing the
Farm v;irsity and juniors made
against the San Francisco Olympic
Club Wednesday night tags the Cards
as today's favorites.
Several of the local key first -
stringers have been suffering from
colds, keeping them from practice.
OFFENSE WEAK
In the two games against the
Olympic Club. Junior National A.
A. U. champs, the Cards have had
little opportunity to use their of
i'ense, their weak spot.
"The Compton game will give us
a chance to work on our offense,"
remarked Coach Thornton. "The
squad lacks organization and smooth
ness, which we hope to acquire in
the future," he added.
CHANGES LINE-UP
The coach announced several
changes in the line-up. Bill Weeden
is in at sprint with Dave Nottage
moved to forward. Weeden is a fast
swimmer with lots of endurance, but
is weak on offense. Don Smith has
been moved up from the juniors to
goalie, replacing Bob Breckner.
Jim McDonald replaces Frank
Mitchell at guard. McDonald is a
consistent player, but needs more
experience. Best shot on the team
is Dave Nottage who, with Captain
Ted Moreno, form the nucleus of the
team. Moreno is one of the out
standing guards in the conference,
having been, named all-conference
as a sophomore.
STARTING LINE
Bob Tietjen holds down the other
forward spot and is a deadly shot.
Bruce Jessup, center back, is
steady, but weak on shooting.
Starting line-up for the junior var
sity will be: Dillon, sprint; Hauer
wass, forward; Manwaring, forward;
Abrahamson, center back; Jones,
guard; Pollack, guard; Breckner,
goalie.
