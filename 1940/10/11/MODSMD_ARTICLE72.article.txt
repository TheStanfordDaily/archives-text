# "1940 Politics—dhur"
## 
### 
TWO weeks ago a scientific poll conducted
and released by The Daily revealed that 73
per cent of the student body favored a new
personality in the White House for the nexi
four years.
That this preponderance in favor of Wendel
Willkie is not shared by the nation as a whole
has been proved rather conclusively by several
authoritative nation-wide polls conducted by
experts in the field of indexing public opinion.
However, there are certain ramifications of
Stanford's reaction to the coming election that
are interesting discussion material, although
perhaps no solution can be drawn. The fact that
The Daily brings these aspects to your review
is not to be construed as an expression of edi
torial opinion. Any opinion possessed by Daily
editorial writers is strictly "off the record"; The
Daily as a news organ is non-partisan.
But when Stanford votes 73 per cent strong
for the Republican candidate in 1940, in com
parison to the 55 per cent majorities who fa
vored Republican nominees in 1936 and 1932,
certain questions come to mind, the answers
of which may or may not point toward a change
in the background and environment of Stan
ford students through the past few years.
For instance, it is generally conceded that a
majority of Roosevelt's supporters are persons
who are several notches short of the upper in
come brackets. Does the fact that only 20 pei
cent at Stanford favor Roosevelt, while Repub
lican support has mounted by the enormous
(for a small school) total of 18 per cent, mean
that the higher moneyed class now forms 6
larger proportion of Stanford's population?
Another question, following from the first
query, is whether the rise in tuition at Stanford
has caused the marginal student to go else
where, his place to be filled by an under
graduate from more fortunate economic circum
stances. If this situation were true (and there
is no proof that it is - or isn't), one Rooseveli
vote would be lost, one Republican vote gained.
A point favoring the above hypotheses, how
ever, is the fact that the frosh—the first class to
enroll under the higher tuition rate—favored
Willkie more strongly than the rest of the stu
dent body. The explanation of this could be,
of course, that environment has affected their
choice, and that a certain percentage of them
will have the opportunity to change their minds
under the liberal influence of college life.
Former Stanford students, and even many
present upperclassmen, vow that they have
never seen so many "big" cars in front of Roble
and Encina. This can hardly be accepted as
scientific proof that Stanford's student-income
level has risen, even in face of the predomi
nantly pro-Willkie attitude of the frosh as di
vulged by the poll.
Naturally, it's possible that claims of such a
trend are fallacious; there may be political rea
sons why the Republican majority at Stanford
has increased. Perhaps the third-term issue is
the reason for Roosevelt's fall in popularity, or
his foreign policy. Maybe Stanfordites are just
curious to see what another man could do from
the Chief Executive's chair. Or perhaps the old
law of averages is involved, and the influx of
Republicanism is merely coincidence.
Maybe Stanford just doesn't like Roosevelt.
But whatever the reason—or combination of
reasons for Stanford's sudden preponderance
of rock-ribbed Republicanism, the whole dis
cussion is charged with interesting material for
controversy. G. M.
