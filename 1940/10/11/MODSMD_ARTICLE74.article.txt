### BUD AMES 
TIIE SAME OLD STOItY—BUT DIFFERENT
|T APPEARS that the hard working boys in the halls
have gotten the jump on the Row men—and wom
en—this year.
This is fall quarter, and fall quarter to every Stan
fordite means the holocaust, confusion, the knock
down-drag-out which heralds the approach of rushing
season.
The hallmen shout, "Don't go row. Every row man
is nothing but a snob, and he usually rolls out, and
it costs you millions and millions of dollars to live
in a fraternity, and ..."
And the rowmen holler back, "Youse guys is nuts.
Don't you fellows go hall. They're all a bunch of
stick-in-the-muds down there. All they do is sit in
those halls — the 'rocks' — -and wonder what they can
do except study, study, study."
The middleman—the rushee—has one arm pulled
out of the socket by a hallman, and the other arm
pulled out by a rowman. The man who starts pulling
first and pulling the hardest usually gets him (what's
left of 'im).
This year, the hallmen pulled the "coup do grace"
of the decade, and began pulling first.
* * # *
SEE, Bub, the hallmen pulled off a nifty trick.
They said they are going to do one thing. They
actually are going to accomplish two things.
The little trick is the plan instituted by Interclub
Council early this week to show interested freshmen
through Toyon and Branner halls come this Oct. 16.
The freshmen will be coddled through a few talks and
a smoker and then shown the (quote) "special facili
ties of the halls" (unquote).
So while the row has been bickering among them
selves, the hallmen have done the smart thing and
the smooth thing and slipped the freshmen in for a
quick look at the halls.
Three cheers- for the halls.

JJOB LOW, chairman of this hall event, said, "The
event has been planned to fill a definite lacking
in freshman orientation to Stanford, as heretofore the
freshman class has never had a chance to see the
facilities to be offered by halls and clubs before their
sophomore years."
His point is well taken. What he says is true. For
a long time now, the halls have been getting the raw
ond of much of the rushing, swamped under the lure
\>f fraternity life.
This month's event should set a worthwhile prece
dent.

TIIE SAME OLD STOItY—BUT DIFFERENT
|T APPEARS that the hard working boys in the halls
have gotten the jump on the Row men—and wom
en—this year.
This is fall quarter, and fall quarter to every Stan
fordite means the holocaust, confusion, the knock
down-drag-out which heralds the approach of rushing
season.
The hallmen shout, "Don't go row. Every row man
is nothing but a snob, and he usually rolls out, and
it costs you millions and millions of dollars to live
in a fraternity, and ..."
And the rowmen holler back, "Youse guys is nuts.
Don't you fellows go hall. They're all a bunch of
stick-in-the-muds down there. All they do is sit in
those halls — the 'rocks' — -and wonder what they can
do except study, study, study."
The middleman—the rushee—has one arm pulled
out of the socket by a hallman, and the other arm
pulled out by a rowman. The man who starts pulling
first and pulling the hardest usually gets him (what's
left of 'im).
This year, the hallmen pulled the "coup do grace"
of the decade, and began pulling first.

SEE, Bub, the hallmen pulled off a nifty trick.
They said they are going to do one thing. They
actually are going to accomplish two things.
The little trick is the plan instituted by Interclub
Council early this week to show interested freshmen
through Toyon and Branner halls come this Oct. 16.
The freshmen will be coddled through a few talks and
a smoker and then shown the (quote) "special facili
ties of the halls" (unquote).
So while the row has been bickering among them
selves, the hallmen have done the smart thing and
the smooth thing and slipped the freshmen in for a
quick look at the halls.
Three cheers- for the halls.
