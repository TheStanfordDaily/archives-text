## LET'S HAVE SPORTSMANSHIP 
### 
THE EDITOR, SIR:
After several lean years in football, it looks as
if Stanford has a team, as you may have heard. Dur
ing those bad years we had one saving grate —we
were always good sports even when taking terrific
beatings.
And now, just because things are looking up, some
ignorant people think we don't have to be good sports.
Even Yell Leader Gordy Nicoll was leading I he rooting
section to count off penalties as the officials stepped
them off. This is inexcusable and has never been
done at Stanford before. So please remember—this
isn't Cal and there are more important things than
winning a football game.
