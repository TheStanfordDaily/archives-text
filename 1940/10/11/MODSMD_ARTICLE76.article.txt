# A 						LOGICAL SOLUTION

TIIE EDITOR. SIR:
It seems that there is some objection to Rally
Committee's recent windshield stickers. Whether this
criticism represents just a noisy (STINKO) minority,
or a legitimate proportion of the student body is hard
to determine. Just to show you that we do "give a
damn" what you .students think, we want to ask your
help in suggesting stickers for future games. There
will be a cardboard box nailed to the outside of the
door of Room 1!J in Old Union where all .suggestions
for stickers, windshield cartoons, or card stunts can
be placed. Please have all of them in on or before the
Sunday noon preceding each game. The Washington
State mascot or whatever you want to call it is a
cougar. That will Kive you something to work on.
Yes, we know what some of you guys are thinking,
but we can't use it!
So to all of you supercritics now is your chance
to think up your own stickers. Let's go to it.
Rally Committee, B. K.
