# A 						MEANS TO AN END

THE EDITOR, SIR:
There has been much talk and many words
about the car stickers reading "konko THE bronco"
and most of it has been detrimental to the Rally Com
mittee for using the phrase.
But I think that whether it is really a good motto
or not is determined by the amount of comment it
raises on the campus and this one has certainly done
that.
In place of one small rally story in The Daily and a
few car stickers, a whole column in the paper for two
days has been devoted to it. This certainly accom
plishes the purpose for which the stickers were de
signed. PUBLICITY and SPIRIT.
Satisfied
