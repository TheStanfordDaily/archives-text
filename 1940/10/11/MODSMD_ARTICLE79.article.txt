# AT HOME IN THE HOME

r I'M IE EDITOR. SIR:
What about more space in the time schedule for
women? Certainly a college graduate should know a
little something about Home Economics. While ' Wom
en in the Home" is an excellent course, its enrollment
is limited to 30 selected seniors. Why not provide
similar courses for undergraduate women?
Wiih the new accommodations at the Roths I
should think that an arrangement could be made so
that more Stanford women would be at home in the
home. Stanford men are always shouting that a wom
an's place is there. Well, that's all right. All we need
is the opportunity.
