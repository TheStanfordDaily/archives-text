# Exhibit Shows Stage of 1920's
## 
### 
American stage life of the '20s and
the successes of the Bonstelle pro
ductions companies during that pe
riod are contained in a colorful ex
hibit now on view in the lobby of
the main library.
The display is built around the
life of Jessie Bonstelle, actress, stage
director, producer and manager.
Miss Bonstelle pioneered the stage
and theater life of the twenties, and
at one time had productions under
way in 15 cities along the Atlantic
coast.
Actresses and actors of present
day fame who received their start
in companies directed and managed
by Miss Bonstelle arc Ann Harding,
Helen Gahagan, Gale Sondergaard,
Katharine Cornell, and Melvyn
Douglas.
A chart of the personnel of all the
companies shows that a Stanford
graduate ranked high among ihe
group of actors. He is Lester Vail,
'22, known on the campus as Lester
Seib.
Miss Bonstelle's stock company
eventually became the famous De
troit Civic Theater which, although
short-lived, has served as a model
for Community Theaters since.
Supplementing this exhibit is a
collection of up-to-date pamphlets
and newspapers published in Mexico
dealing with the war in Europe. The
papers show the extensive propa
ganda work being carried on by the
Nazis in the South American coun
tries.
