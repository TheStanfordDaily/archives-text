"MAGNIFICENT DELUSION," by Fred G. Clark, on sale at the Stan
lord Bookstore. $1.
It is later than you think. This admonition, theme of Fred Clark's 155-
page thesis, is no scarchcad treatment of flag-waving Americanism. It is
a simple sentence fronting for an earnest plea for action.

If we have a way of life that
| believe in we must unite to protect i
it. This is not a call to military arms, i
| but a call to citizens who want to
j preserve their citizenship as inter
j preted by the U. S. Constitution.
Our "streamlined social con
science" is undermining our democ
racy. This is our "Magnificent Delu
sion." We are nurturing the idea j
that in America you can get some- 1
thing for nothing. We are clamoring j
lor an abundant life for everyone, i
without realizing the tenets of relief,
who pays lor it and why. We are J
creating a populace that wants all
and will give nothing.
OFFERS SOLUTION
As lor the solution to this grand J
decay, Clark also offers that. In or
der he discusses politics, youth, ed
ucation, and the church, offering a
plan for their participation in the
remedial work.
Champion of the laissez-faire life,
the author points out that Rome fell
because it went from free enter
prise to government control in
steady degradation, until there was
nothing to hold Rome together.
CLEAN-UP NEEDED
According Lo Clark, America, in
the next five years (it she lasts that
long) must clean up local and na
tional politics; go back to individual
free enterprise; realize that the pub
lic debt is our debt and no one
else's; get rid of our army of pro
fessional mendicants; get rid of the
"white-collar complex"; and quit
crucifying our commerce on the
cross of social conscience.

It isn't a very big book and the j
print is easy on even the tired stu
dent's eyes. Everyone should read
it whether or not he agrees with Mr.
Clark's ideas. It's a thought-provok
ing treatise written by a layman for
the average man.

It is later than you think. This admonition, theme of Fred Clark's 155-
page thesis, is no scarchcad treatment of flag-waving Americanism. It is
a simple sentence fronting for an earnest plea for action.

If we have a way of life that
| believe in we must unite to protect i
it. This is not a call to military arms, i
| but a call to citizens who want to
j preserve their citizenship as inter
j preted by the U. S. Constitution.
Our "streamlined social con
science" is undermining our democ
racy. This is our "Magnificent Delu
sion." We are nurturing the idea j
that in America you can get some- 1
thing for nothing. We are clamoring j
lor an abundant life for everyone, i
without realizing the tenets of relief,
who pays lor it and why. We are J
creating a populace that wants all
and will give nothing.
OFFERS SOLUTION
As lor the solution to this grand J
decay, Clark also offers that. In or
der he discusses politics, youth, ed
ucation, and the church, offering a
plan for their participation in the
remedial work.
Champion of the laissez-faire life,
the author points out that Rome fell
because it went from free enter
prise to government control in
steady degradation, until there was
nothing to hold Rome together.
CLEAN-UP NEEDED
According Lo Clark, America, in
the next five years (it she lasts that
long) must clean up local and na
tional politics; go back to individual
free enterprise; realize that the pub
lic debt is our debt and no one
else's; get rid of our army of pro
fessional mendicants; get rid of the
"white-collar complex"; and quit
crucifying our commerce on the
cross of social conscience.

It isn't a very big book and the j
print is easy on even the tired stu
dent's eyes. Everyone should read
it whether or not he agrees with Mr.
Clark's ideas. It's a thought-provok
ing treatise written by a layman for
the average man.
