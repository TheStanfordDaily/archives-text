JJJITLER has absorbed Rumania.
This is the news that readers
in free countries found in their
newspapers during the past week
end. To many, the news meant little
more than the everyday bombing
story released from London or from
Berlin.
But to a people—the Rumanians —
the invasion of their country could
not be overlooked. There were Ger
man soldiers everywhere to prove
that Rumania was no more.
At this time last year some 19 mil
lion Rumanians comprised a na
tion, which itself was torn by bitter
internal strife that threatened revo
lution. The mass of Rumanians—the
peasants—was exploited by many
factional groups whose leaders con
sidered themselves best capable of
determining Rumania's destiny. The
Nazi sympathizers were but one of
these groups that wished to seize the
government and impose itself on
the people.
* * *
Today, the peasants of Rumania
are being exploited—exploited by
a foreign band of army chiefs and
their army of occupation. Once
Rumanians were their own lead
ers, but Rumanians will see their
leaders wiped out by the German
army and secret police. Rumanians
will not dissent, unless they wish
to die at the hands of German
soldiers.
Because citizens of a free country
such as the United States cannot
fully appreciate what it means to be
ruled arbitrarily by an armed force
of another foreign power, Americans
will overlook the immediate conse
quences and go on discussing in
stead what new move Hitler has
made possible by the occupation of
Rumania. But 19 million Rumanians
know that one people has become
slave to a foreign invader who
wears a uniform and speaks a
strange tongue.

JAPAN was left holding the bag
•" when it signed the tri-party pact
with Italy and Germany, according
to observers in this country. Hitler,
ihey say, very naturally would like
to see the British fleet weakened.
What would be better for Hitler than
a scrap between the British and
Japanese fleets.
Germany is being held at hay at
present by the British fleet, and if
Britain were compelled to send
reinforcements to the Far East
Hitler's position in Europe might
be considerably bettered. Ger
many cannot lose by drawing
Japan into the war, but she can
gain considerably.
But Japan has gained little
through her alliance with the Axis
powers. They are isolated from
Japan and cannot help her in any
manner. But Japan, like England, is
an island empire which depends en
tirely on maintaining trade with
other countries with resources that
Japan lacks.
Naval experts say that the Brit
ish fleet can cripple Japan by
throwing a blockade around the
islands. Japan, with a war in
China that already taxes her re
sources, cannot stake everything
on an engagement with the Brit
ish fleet. Japan can lose if Ger
many and Italy succeed in push
ing her into the conflict, but the
Axis powers will win—if only a
single British ship is damaged.
