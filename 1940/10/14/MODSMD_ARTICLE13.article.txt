# 'Poor of New York' to Open Fall Season Thursday Night
## 
### 
A real horse and buggy, marble-top tables, plush and gilt furniture
and fringed velvet will make authentic the early Victorian atmos
phere of "The Poor of New York," to be presented in Memorial Hall Oct.
17, 18, and 19.
Biggest problem was that of obtaining a period carriage for the

play, according to Gus Hebgen
Carlisle Kramer, property heads.
The old Hopkins estate saved the '■
•situation by furnishing an authentic
iour-seated carriage covered with a !
fringed canopy. Traffic was nearly j
halted on Palm Drive with the fu- i
ror that was caused towing the
carriage behind a car to the theater.
The Idle Hour Riding Stables have
provided the horse for the produc
tion. He will be carted back and
forth from the stables to the theater
before and after each performance.
Period furniture was found in
abundance at the Park Country Day
School, formerly the Mills estate.
"We cleaned the place out," de
clared Kramer, "I doubt if they have
any place to sit any more."
Candles in bottles and checked
tablecloths came from L'Omelette,
while a junk yard furnished an old
baby carriage topped with a fancy
parasol.
There will be nine scene shifts in
the play. Most interesting from the
technical point of view are the snow
scene in Union Square in New York
achieved by showering paper snow
through a huge sieve onto the
stage; and the fire scene.
The fire scene will have a two
story building in which the upper
story collapses behind the first.
Lights and muriatic acid plus am
monium peroxide thrown together
will produce convincing fire and
smoke.
