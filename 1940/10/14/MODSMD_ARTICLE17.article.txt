# Noted Explorer To Speak Here 7:30, Tomorrow
## Sir Hubert Wilkins To Discuss Values Of Modern Science 
### 
Sir Hubert Wilkins, noted Arctic
explorer and scientist, speaks tomor
row night in the Tuesday Evening
Series on "Next Steps Toward Civili
zation." He has an unusual record
of achievements which includes six
"firsts":
First to discover new land from
the air.
First to cross the Arctic Occan
by airplane.
First to land on any occan and,
unaided, walk home.
First to fly over the Antarctic
Continent.
First to fly about the North Pole
by moonlight in the depth of win
ter.
First and only explorer to use a
submarine under the Arctic ice.
Sir Hubert will discuss the ques
tion, "Can the average individual
expect that, scientific knowledge
may at least offer hope of a way of
life which can be freed from much
of the present uncertainty and spec
ulation?"
UPHOLDS SCIENCE
His conclusions and answer to this
question will be based upon his years
of scientific study. He believes that,
modern science now has means of
enabling mankind to save itself from
self-destruction. Not the least
among these is a far more accurate
foreknowledge of weather conditions.
"The ability to predict weather
throughout the world for years
ahead provides a key to the solution
of economic conflicts, thus removing
the greatest incentive to war and
struggle," says Sir Hubert Wilkins.
Wilkins went abroad earlier this
year, flying to Lisbon from the
United States. The explorer waited
five days when in Paris for plane
passage to London. He persuaded
two generals and a mechanic, about
to leave in a French machine, to
take an additional passenger. No
sooner had they taken off than the
plane was hit by the fire of one of
i several German Messerchmitts.
