# Draft Board Plans Farm Registration
## Stanford Students Of Conscription Age To Sign Lip on Quad 
### 
Registration of Stanford's 1,750
draft-eligible men came a step
closer to successful completion over
the week-end with announcement
by Assistant University Registrar
Karl M. Cowdery of eight special
registration places.
It was also made clear that all
students attending the University
whose home or peirnanent residence
is in Santa Clara County must regis
ter at their regular polling places, as
the special facilities are only for
those who do not reside in the
county and will not be able to go
to their home town to register.
Eight faculty men over the 35-year
age limit have been chosen and
sworn in by Dr. Cowdery as assist
ants to head each of the branch j
bureaus.
REGISTRATION PLACES
These men and their campus loca
tions on Wednesday from 7 o'clock
in the morning to 9 o'clock in the
evening will be as follows:
Ad Building lobby — Dr. K. M.
Cowdery.
Room 429, Biology Building—Pro
fessor Douglas M. Whitaker.
Room 1, Chemistry Building —
Professor Carl R. Noller.
Room 24, Political Science Build
ing—Dr. Thomas A. Bailey.
Room IG. B.A.C. Building — Al
fred R. Masters.
Education Building Lobby—Dewey
Goodspeed.
Room 270, Engineering Building—
Professor W. B. Kindy.
Room 532, Engineering Building —
Professor Earl Thomas.
In addition to these will be the
two regular polling places on cam
pus for those registered for voting
here.
Chairman Bill Turner of the Stan
ford National Emergency Committee
stated that students from out of the
county may register at Stanford and
then have their registration trans
ferred to their home board or may
have it kept at Stanford until they
leave the University.
SIMPLE PROCESS
Further details on who must reg
ister were released by the commit
tee—all men, no matter what their
physical condition, who have passed
their 21st birthday and have not yet
passed their 36th birthday, citizen or
alien, must register.
Dr. Cowdery asserted that the reg
istration process will not take more
than 20 minutes and that "it is a
relatively simple process, merely a
short questionnaire."
He stated that there will be ten
faculty men at each registration
place to assist the assistants and
make the procedure efficient and
smooth. There will be a double
staff in the Ad Building.
COMMITTEE NAMED
Turner announced that he had ap
pointed the following committee to
stand during the whole year to aid
students in problems which may
arise:
Dwight Hutchinson, Daily editor;
Jack Kenned j', son of U. S. Ambas
sador to England and Business
School student; Bill Kimball, senior
R.O.T.C. student; Bob Newell, senior
committeeman and head of the
1941 Stanford Fund Drive.
