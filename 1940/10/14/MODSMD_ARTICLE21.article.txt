# Cards Erase Four-Year Loss Record With 7-6 Victory Over Favored Broncos Before 60,000
## Indian Eleven Remains Undefeated And Untied Despite Valiant Efforts Of Santa Clara and Lady Luck 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Saturday Coach Clark Shaughnessy and his Indian warriors won
their spurs in big time football competition.
In fact they dug these spurs deep into the flanks of the Santa Clara
Broncos to win their greatest grid victory since the Rose Bowl game
of 1936 by the rather uninformative score of 7-ti.

Not since that New Year's Day
in '36 when the Vowing Sophs ended
their collegiate football careers with
a 7-0 win over Southern Methodist
has Stanford scored such a decisive
victory, in spite of that 7-6 score,
over a national ranking eleven.
Doubly satisfactory was this tri
umph over Santa Clara, for it broke
a devastating string of Bronco vic
tories with scores such as 22-0 and
27-7 to haunt the memories of the
Farm fans,
SCORE POOR INDICATION
Proof of what a poor indication
the score v/as of the type of smash
ing, brilliant football the Cards
really played came from Santa
Clara's Cojich Buck Shaw who said
that Stanford should have won its
ball game by three or four touch
downs.
The Indians* only touchdown,
which proved sufficient, came with
characteristic suddenness. Early in
the second quarter, with the ball in
their possession on the Bronco 43,
the Redshirts opened their bag of
tricks. The unstoppable Norm
Standlee crunched to the 40 and
then Frankie Albert lateralcd to
Pete Kmetovic who scooted to the
Bronc 12.
Captain Hugh Gallarneau snaked
through that terrific Santa Clara
line to the eleven and from there
on a fake reverse to Kmetovic
Standlee took the ball from Albert,
flashed through a large hole and
dove into the end zone.
PRAYER PASS
Santa Clara attached all their
hopes, in fact ail their effectiveness,
to one long prayerful pass thrown
by the only Bronco back who
looked at all capable Saturday,
Kenny Casanega, straight down the
middle for 50 yards to John Thorn.
Thom, who had slipped behind the
momentarily napping Card de
fenders, Pete Kmetovic and Hugh
Gallarneau, gathered in the pig
skin and skidded to the only Bronco
score.
Otherwise, except for a couple
of 8- and 9-yard gainers by the
highly touted but disappointing
Jimmy Johnson and this same Ca
sanega, the Indians kept the Bron
cos well corraled.
STANDLEE CRASHES
However, the real story of the
game concerned the crashing and
carrying of Stanford's All-American
Norm Standlee, the terrific drive
and vicious tackling of all the Stan
ford line, and the unquenchable
spirit of the Cardinals which kept
them hammering all afternoon at
the Santa Clara goal despite an
endless string of tough breaks.
And not merely incidental were
those nine soaring punts of Stand
lee which averaged over 48 yards,
I the brainy quarterbacking of cool
I Frankie Albert, and the usual flashy
j running by "Skeeter Peter"' Kmeto
vic and Captain Gallarneau.
According to the players a major
part of the credit for the victory
should go to Coaches Marchie
Schwartz, Phil Bengtson, Jim Law
son, and Shaughnessy for their
complete diagnosis of the Santa
Clara offense and their defensive
formations which stopped so coldly
| that offense which toppled Utah and
