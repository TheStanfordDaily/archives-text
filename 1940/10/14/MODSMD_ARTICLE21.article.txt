# Cards Erase Four-Year Loss Record With 7-6 Victory Over Favored Broncos Before 60,000
## Indian Eleven Remains Undefeated And Untied Despite Valiant Efforts Of Santa Clara and Lady Luck 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Saturday Coach Clark Shaughnessy and his Indian warriors won
their spurs in big time football competition.
In fact they dug these spurs deep into the flanks of the Santa Clara
Broncos to win their greatest grid victory since the Rose Bowl game
of 1936 by the rather uninformative score of 7-ti.

Not since that New Year's Day
in '36 when the Vowing Sophs ended
their collegiate football careers with
a 7-0 win over Southern Methodist
has Stanford scored such a decisive
victory, in spite of that 7-6 score,
over a national ranking eleven.
Doubly satisfactory was this tri
umph over Santa Clara, for it broke
a devastating string of Bronco vic
tories with scores such as 22-0 and
27-7 to haunt the memories of the
Farm fans,
SCORE POOR INDICATION
Proof of what a poor indication
the score v/as of the type of smash
ing, brilliant football the Cards
really played came from Santa
Clara's Cojich Buck Shaw who said
that Stanford should have won its
ball game by three or four touch
downs.
The Indians* only touchdown,
which proved sufficient, came with
characteristic suddenness. Early in
the second quarter, with the ball in
their possession on the Bronco 43,
the Redshirts opened their bag of
tricks. The unstoppable Norm
Standlee crunched to the 40 and
then Frankie Albert lateralcd to
Pete Kmetovic who scooted to the
Bronc 12.
Captain Hugh Gallarneau snaked
through that terrific Santa Clara
line to the eleven and from there
on a fake reverse to Kmetovic
Standlee took the ball from Albert,
flashed through a large hole and
dove into the end zone.
PRAYER PASS
Santa Clara attached all their
hopes, in fact ail their effectiveness,
to one long prayerful pass thrown
by the only Bronco back who
looked at all capable Saturday,
Kenny Casanega, straight down the
middle for 50 yards to John Thorn.
Thom, who had slipped behind the
momentarily napping Card de
fenders, Pete Kmetovic and Hugh
Gallarneau, gathered in the pig
skin and skidded to the only Bronco
score.
Otherwise, except for a couple
of 8- and 9-yard gainers by the
highly touted but disappointing
Jimmy Johnson and this same Ca
sanega, the Indians kept the Bron
cos well corraled.
STANDLEE CRASHES
However, the real story of the
game concerned the crashing and
carrying of Stanford's All-American
Norm Standlee, the terrific drive
and vicious tackling of all the Stan
ford line, and the unquenchable
spirit of the Cardinals which kept
them hammering all afternoon at
the Santa Clara goal despite an
endless string of tough breaks.
And not merely incidental were
those nine soaring punts of Stand
lee which averaged over 48 yards,
I the brainy quarterbacking of cool
I Frankie Albert, and the usual flashy
j running by "Skeeter Peter"' Kmeto
vic and Captain Gallarneau.
According to the players a major
part of the credit for the victory
should go to Coaches Marchie
Schwartz, Phil Bengtson, Jim Law
son, and Shaughnessy for their
complete diagnosis of the Santa
Clara offense and their defensive
formations which stopped so coldly
| that offense which toppled Utah and
U.C.L.A. and which Santa Clara
expects to carry them into the
Sugar Bowl for the third time in
four years.
The Indians' board of strategy
reached genius proportions when
they actually anticipated Santa
Clara's mysterious X - formation.
The story behind the story is that
all-night session Friday at which
Shaughnessy & Co. tracked down
this unknown weapon of offense.
Maybe it was just a hunch but
the Farm fans will call it football
genius that prompted the Card
coaching staff to settle on the ef
fective offense used by the profes
sional New York Giants and in
which Nello Falaschi, former Bron
co star and assistant coach, is an
integral part as the source of the
Broncos' new offense.
But the diagnosis was perfect and
the doctor, Clark Shaughnessy, pre
scribed the correct remedy. And

| the administration of this remedy by
those fiery sophomores, Banducci,
1 Taylor, and Palmer, and the entire
length of the Indian line was the
j pay-off.
Ends Stan GrafT, Freddie Meyer,
Hank Norberg, Clemmie Tomer
lin, and Bob Ditlevsen refused to
be fooled by the usually effective
Santa Clara end-arounds and their
brilliant punt coverage kept the in
vaders' average return to a scant
7 yards per punt. Tackles Bruno
Banducci, Rod Warnecke, Claude
Purkitt, and Ed Stamm refused to
be suckered, and stopped those
powerful end runs which their
flankmen drove into them.
With Dick Palmer calling what
Assistant Coach Bengtson said was
the best game of defensive signals
he had ever seen, the guards, Chuck
Taylor and Ken Robesky, and the
j centers, Vic Lindskog and Doug
; Stahle, stopped any threats aerial
or otherwise down the middle.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 13 (UP).—
j The Washington Redskins rallied
j with a 14-point second half splurge
| today and defeated the Chicago
Cardinals, 28 to 21.
Saturday Coach Clark Shaughnessy and his Indian warriors won
their spurs in big time football competition.
In fact they dug these spurs deep into the flanks of the Santa Clara
Broncos to win their greatest grid victory since the Rose Bowl game
of 1936 by the rather uninformative score of 7-ti.

Not since that New Year's Day
in '36 when the Vowing Sophs ended
their collegiate football careers with
a 7-0 win over Southern Methodist
has Stanford scored such a decisive
victory, in spite of that 7-6 score,
over a national ranking eleven.
Doubly satisfactory was this tri
umph over Santa Clara, for it broke
a devastating string of Bronco vic
tories with scores such as 22-0 and
27-7 to haunt the memories of the
Farm fans,
SCORE POOR INDICATION
Proof of what a poor indication
the score v/as of the type of smash
ing, brilliant football the Cards
really played came from Santa
Clara's Cojich Buck Shaw who said
that Stanford should have won its
ball game by three or four touch
downs.
The Indians* only touchdown,
which proved sufficient, came with
characteristic suddenness. Early in
the second quarter, with the ball in
their possession on the Bronco 43,
the Redshirts opened their bag of
tricks. The unstoppable Norm
Standlee crunched to the 40 and
then Frankie Albert lateralcd to
Pete Kmetovic who scooted to the
Bronc 12.
Captain Hugh Gallarneau snaked
through that terrific Santa Clara
line to the eleven and from there
on a fake reverse to Kmetovic
Standlee took the ball from Albert,
flashed through a large hole and
dove into the end zone.
PRAYER PASS
Santa Clara attached all their
hopes, in fact ail their effectiveness,
to one long prayerful pass thrown
by the only Bronco back who
looked at all capable Saturday,
Kenny Casanega, straight down the
middle for 50 yards to John Thorn.
Thom, who had slipped behind the
momentarily napping Card de
fenders, Pete Kmetovic and Hugh
Gallarneau, gathered in the pig
skin and skidded to the only Bronco
score.
Otherwise, except for a couple
of 8- and 9-yard gainers by the
highly touted but disappointing
Jimmy Johnson and this same Ca
sanega, the Indians kept the Bron
cos well corraled.
STANDLEE CRASHES
However, the real story of the
game concerned the crashing and
carrying of Stanford's All-American
Norm Standlee, the terrific drive
and vicious tackling of all the Stan
ford line, and the unquenchable
spirit of the Cardinals which kept
them hammering all afternoon at
the Santa Clara goal despite an
endless string of tough breaks.
And not merely incidental were
those nine soaring punts of Stand
lee which averaged over 48 yards,
I the brainy quarterbacking of cool
I Frankie Albert, and the usual flashy
j running by "Skeeter Peter"' Kmeto
vic and Captain Gallarneau.
According to the players a major
part of the credit for the victory
should go to Coaches Marchie
Schwartz, Phil Bengtson, Jim Law
son, and Shaughnessy for their
complete diagnosis of the Santa
Clara offense and their defensive
formations which stopped so coldly
| that offense which toppled Utah and
U.C.L.A. and which Santa Clara
expects to carry them into the
Sugar Bowl for the third time in
four years.
The Indians' board of strategy
reached genius proportions when
they actually anticipated Santa
Clara's mysterious X - formation.
The story behind the story is that
all-night session Friday at which
Shaughnessy & Co. tracked down
this unknown weapon of offense.
Maybe it was just a hunch but
the Farm fans will call it football
genius that prompted the Card
coaching staff to settle on the ef
fective offense used by the profes
sional New York Giants and in
which Nello Falaschi, former Bron
co star and assistant coach, is an
integral part as the source of the
Broncos' new offense.
But the diagnosis was perfect and
the doctor, Clark Shaughnessy, pre
scribed the correct remedy. And

| the administration of this remedy by
those fiery sophomores, Banducci,
1 Taylor, and Palmer, and the entire
length of the Indian line was the
j pay-off.
Ends Stan GrafT, Freddie Meyer,
Hank Norberg, Clemmie Tomer
lin, and Bob Ditlevsen refused to
be fooled by the usually effective
Santa Clara end-arounds and their
brilliant punt coverage kept the in
vaders' average return to a scant
7 yards per punt. Tackles Bruno
Banducci, Rod Warnecke, Claude
Purkitt, and Ed Stamm refused to
be suckered, and stopped those
powerful end runs which their
flankmen drove into them.
With Dick Palmer calling what
Assistant Coach Bengtson said was
the best game of defensive signals
he had ever seen, the guards, Chuck
Taylor and Ken Robesky, and the
j centers, Vic Lindskog and Doug
; Stahle, stopped any threats aerial
or otherwise down the middle.

WASHINGTON, Oct. 13 (UP).—
j The Washington Redskins rallied
j with a 14-point second half splurge
| today and defeated the Chicago
Cardinals, 28 to 21.
Saturday Coach Clark Shaughnessy and his Indian warriors won
their spurs in big time football competition.
In fact they dug these spurs deep into the flanks of the Santa Clara
Broncos to win their greatest grid victory since the Rose Bowl game
of 1936 by the rather uninformative score of 7-ti.

Not since that New Year's Day
in '36 when the Vowing Sophs ended
their collegiate football careers with
a 7-0 win over Southern Methodist
has Stanford scored such a decisive
victory, in spite of that 7-6 score,
over a national ranking eleven.
Doubly satisfactory was this tri
umph over Santa Clara, for it broke
a devastating string of Bronco vic
tories with scores such as 22-0 and
27-7 to haunt the memories of the
Farm fans,
SCORE POOR INDICATION
Proof of what a poor indication
the score v/as of the type of smash
ing, brilliant football the Cards
really played came from Santa
Clara's Cojich Buck Shaw who said
that Stanford should have won its
ball game by three or four touch
downs.
The Indians* only touchdown,
which proved sufficient, came with
characteristic suddenness. Early in
the second quarter, with the ball in
their possession on the Bronco 43,
the Redshirts opened their bag of
tricks. The unstoppable Norm
Standlee crunched to the 40 and
then Frankie Albert lateralcd to
Pete Kmetovic who scooted to the
Bronc 12.
Captain Hugh Gallarneau snaked
through that terrific Santa Clara
line to the eleven and from there
on a fake reverse to Kmetovic
Standlee took the ball from Albert,
flashed through a large hole and
dove into the end zone.
PRAYER PASS
Santa Clara attached all their
hopes, in fact ail their effectiveness,
to one long prayerful pass thrown
by the only Bronco back who
looked at all capable Saturday,
Kenny Casanega, straight down the
middle for 50 yards to John Thorn.
Thom, who had slipped behind the
momentarily napping Card de
fenders, Pete Kmetovic and Hugh
Gallarneau, gathered in the pig
skin and skidded to the only Bronco
score.
Otherwise, except for a couple
of 8- and 9-yard gainers by the
highly touted but disappointing
Jimmy Johnson and this same Ca
sanega, the Indians kept the Bron
cos well corraled.
STANDLEE CRASHES
However, the real story of the
game concerned the crashing and
carrying of Stanford's All-American
Norm Standlee, the terrific drive
and vicious tackling of all the Stan
ford line, and the unquenchable
spirit of the Cardinals which kept
them hammering all afternoon at
the Santa Clara goal despite an
endless string of tough breaks.
And not merely incidental were
those nine soaring punts of Stand
lee which averaged over 48 yards,
I the brainy quarterbacking of cool
I Frankie Albert, and the usual flashy
j running by "Skeeter Peter"' Kmeto
vic and Captain Gallarneau.
According to the players a major
part of the credit for the victory
should go to Coaches Marchie
Schwartz, Phil Bengtson, Jim Law
son, and Shaughnessy for their
complete diagnosis of the Santa
Clara offense and their defensive
formations which stopped so coldly
| that offense which toppled Utah and
U.C.L.A. and which Santa Clara
expects to carry them into the
Sugar Bowl for the third time in
four years.
The Indians' board of strategy
reached genius proportions when
they actually anticipated Santa
Clara's mysterious X - formation.
The story behind the story is that
all-night session Friday at which
Shaughnessy & Co. tracked down
this unknown weapon of offense.
Maybe it was just a hunch but
the Farm fans will call it football
genius that prompted the Card
coaching staff to settle on the ef
fective offense used by the profes
sional New York Giants and in
which Nello Falaschi, former Bron
co star and assistant coach, is an
integral part as the source of the
Broncos' new offense.
But the diagnosis was perfect and
the doctor, Clark Shaughnessy, pre
scribed the correct remedy. And

| the administration of this remedy by
those fiery sophomores, Banducci,
1 Taylor, and Palmer, and the entire
length of the Indian line was the
j pay-off.
Ends Stan GrafT, Freddie Meyer,
Hank Norberg, Clemmie Tomer
lin, and Bob Ditlevsen refused to
be fooled by the usually effective
Santa Clara end-arounds and their
brilliant punt coverage kept the in
vaders' average return to a scant
7 yards per punt. Tackles Bruno
Banducci, Rod Warnecke, Claude
Purkitt, and Ed Stamm refused to
be suckered, and stopped those
powerful end runs which their
flankmen drove into them.
With Dick Palmer calling what
Assistant Coach Bengtson said was
the best game of defensive signals
he had ever seen, the guards, Chuck
Taylor and Ken Robesky, and the
j centers, Vic Lindskog and Doug
; Stahle, stopped any threats aerial
