# Italy Boasts Naval Win Over Britain
## Duce's Land Forces Drive Across Egypt Toward Suez Canal 
### 
ROME, Oct. 13 (UP).—ltaly's high
command tonight boasted a major
naval victory over Britain's Med
iterranean fleet in a battle near
Malta in which a 7000-ton British
cruiser, an Italian destroyer and two
Italian torpedo boats were said to
have been sent to the bottom by tor
pedoes and bombs.
Although the Italian navy lost
three vessels in the battle, waged
Friday night and early Saturday in
the narorw Straits of Sicily, the high
command claimed that the British
finally were forced to flee and lost
about 7000 tons against Italy's loss
of only 2GOO tons.
DRIVE TOWARD SUEZ
Two British fighter planes were
shot down, it was added, and one
Italian plane was lost.
The British warships were as
sumed in Fascist quarters to have
been on a supply mission for the
fortress of Malta, which has been
under constant Italian air siege.
Italy's boast of the naval victory
almost overshadowed another claim
of the high command of perhaps far
greater portent — disclosure that
Marshal Rodolfo Graziani's columns
have resumed their drive across the
Egyptian desert toward Alexandria
and the Suez Canal.
According to the Italian com
munique, Italy's swift "Mas" tor
pedo boats, attacking "substantial
British naval forces," sank a British
cruiser of the 7000-ton Neptune class
which normally carried' about 550
officers and men. There was no
mention of the fate of the crew.
BRITISH LOSSES' HIGH
Ilalian planes, rushing into the
battle, were said to have badly dam
aged a British aircraft carrier and a
heavy cruiser with big bombs.
Italy's losses were described as a
1400-ton destroyer and two (500-ton
torpedo boats, with "most of the
crews" saved.
