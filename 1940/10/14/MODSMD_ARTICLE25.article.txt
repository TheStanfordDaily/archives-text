Mr. Roosevelt's a gentleman; Mr. Willkie's not so rugged—and in times
when politics has become Fart Two ol' feminine midnight chats, a majority
of women are willing to drop everything to gabble about the HMO Presi
dential candidates. The Republican is a favorite, for reasons extending
from "he looks so sincere" to his ability as a provider, while the President

is endorsed because of his experience,
and his being a "Harvard man."
Only four out of one hundred
women who were spending their
time in conjecture are eligible to
vote.
