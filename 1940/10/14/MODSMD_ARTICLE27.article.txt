# Close Canadian U.S. Defense Accord Seen
## Northern Neighbor May Be Urged to Join Pan-American Union 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 13 (UP).â€” J
I The Administration will seek to I
I strengthen relations between the I
; United States and Canada as the
next step in the hemispheric defense j
program outlined by President
Roosevelt Saturday, in his Dayton,
I 0., speech, it was learned tonight.
Administration leaders were said
j to teel that a remarkable degree of
: solidarity already has been achieved
among the 21 American republics
| and that implementation of bonds |
linking this country with its north
ern neighbor would add much to a
show of hemispheric defense |
j strength.
U. S. CANADIAN ACCORD
Establishment of the U. S.-Cana
i dian joint defense board already has
brought relations between the two
countries to an unprecedented high
point, but it was understood that an
effort will be made to forge a more
1 specific and firmer agreement.
Suggestions have been advanced I
in the past that Canada should be
invited to join the Pan-American j
union of nations, but they never !
| have been accepted. Some observers :
| believed such an invjtation might
j now be contemplated, but most
j diplomatic sources were inclined to
J doubt this.
Inclusion of Canada's industrial
! and military defense units in this j
hemisphere's forces would add much
; to its strategic potentialities, it was j
j felt, while it also would mean indi- i
! rectly a stronger commitment by !
the Latin American republics to side j
with the Democracies against the !
totalitarian powers.
Many diplomats interpreted Mr. j
Roosevelt's speech as a new chal
lenge to the totalitarian powers. '
