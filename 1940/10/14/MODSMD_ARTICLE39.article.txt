### JERRY BRUCKER 
CANT A CLAKA made more first
downs, gained more yards, and
suffered more penalties, but the bet
ter team won in the stadium Satur
day. The Indians outfought and out
thought the Broncos, and fully de
served their one-point victory.
The only complaint anyone made
after the game was against the offi
ciating. Both teams were hurt by
adverse decisions at critical mo
ments, one or two of which were
questionable, but they didn't se
riously affect the final outcome.
The fact that Clark Shaugh
nessy's Indians defeated a great
team in spite <if what can he
called "bad breaks'" makes vic
tory even more sweet.

JJOSE BOWL.
Two four-letter combinations
that spoil "success" for any football
team. And between Stanford and
that goal, lurking in the mists of
uncertainty, are six more'* Pacific
Coast Conference opponents.
Oregon has been disposed of,
next on the Indian niust-win list is
the Washington State Cougar. Fol
lowing in order are Southern Cali
fornia, Ucla, Washington. Oregon
State, and Cal.

the closing minutes of the game.
P rankie Albert picked off a Bronco

pass to end the last Santa Clara
threat and the Indians took the ball

One running plav failed to gain,
and with seconds lo plav ihc In

Albert stood lip and looked the de
fense over, leaned down into the
huddle and delivered the follow

IT WASN'T intended as such, but
it was a very fina gesture when
Clark Shaughnessy went out on the
fieid to question Referee Fitzpatriek's
decision on that fourth quarter Santa
Clara fumble.
The Indian mentor risked a 15-
yard penalty in order to make sure
that his boys got a square deal.
Trie arbiters were slow yesterday,
but from the press box. watching the
game through field glasses, there
was only one play on which I
thought that they really made a
boot, when they called both sides
offside alter a Stanford gain. It

looked as though a blue-jerseyed
Santa Claran was the only man
: across the line.
Snakes have no eyelids. Their
eyes are protected by an immov

||"UMOR reared its ugly head in
the closing minutes of the game.
P rankie Albert picked off a Bronco

pass to end the last Santa Clara
threat and the Indians took the ball
>n the Brone twelve.
One running plav failed to gain,
and with seconds lo plav ihc In
dians went hack into the huddle.
Albert stood lip and looked the de
fense over, leaned down into the
huddle and delivered the follow
ing oration.
"0.K.. who wants to lie down
with it this time!"

IT WASN'T intended as such, but
it was a very fina gesture when
Clark Shaughnessy went out on the
fieid to question Referee Fitzpatriek's
decision on that fourth quarter Santa
Clara fumble.
The Indian mentor risked a 15-
yard penalty in order to make sure
that his boys got a square deal.
Trie arbiters were slow yesterday,
but from the press box. watching the
game through field glasses, there
was only one play on which I
thought that they really made a
boot, when they called both sides
offside alter a Stanford gain. It

looked as though a blue-jerseyed
Santa Claran was the only man
: across the line.
Snakes have no eyelids. Their
eyes are protected by an immov
able section of transparent skin.
This is shed periodically with the
rest of the snake's skin.
CANT A CLAKA made more first
downs, gained more yards, and
suffered more penalties, but the bet
ter team won in the stadium Satur
day. The Indians outfought and out
thought the Broncos, and fully de
served their one-point victory.
The only complaint anyone made
after the game was against the offi
ciating. Both teams were hurt by
adverse decisions at critical mo
ments, one or two of which were
questionable, but they didn't se
riously affect the final outcome.
The fact that Clark Shaugh
nessy's Indians defeated a great
team in spite <if what can he
called "bad breaks'" makes vic
tory even more sweet.

JJOSE BOWL.
Two four-letter combinations
that spoil "success" for any football
team. And between Stanford and
that goal, lurking in the mists of
uncertainty, are six more'* Pacific
Coast Conference opponents.
Oregon has been disposed of,
next on the Indian niust-win list is
the Washington State Cougar. Fol
lowing in order are Southern Cali
fornia, Ucla, Washington. Oregon
State, and Cal.
