# "Cardinals Be Damned"
## 
### 
CARDINALS, created in 1934 by an Ex Com
mittee by-law, is an administrative sub
committee of the student-body governing board.
As such it controls, almost completely, all par
tisan appointments.
First of all it supervises Rally Committee.
Two of its members are the men's and women's
chairmen of Rally-corn. During a packed au
tumn quarter, Cardinals promotes the Big Game
Rally, jolly-up, parade, and the newly organized
Big Game Dance.
It appoints one of its members chairman of
the Bonfire, the Big Game Dance, and authorizes
the head of Rally Committee to sub-appoint
heads of the parade, the jolly-up, and the rally
itself.
According to Article IV of the Constitution
and By-Laws, it is Cardinals' duty to welcome
visiting celebrities, speakers, athletic teams,
and coaches, and to have charge of all high
school programs for which Stanford speakers
are requested.
In coincidence with game celebrations, Car
dinals sponsors dances during fall quarter and
the rest of the year. Wherever any activity
needs aid, Cardinals is supposedly ready to
assist.
Cardinals, in addition, is responsible for the
campus' two largest drives—the Red Cross
Drive in the fall, and the Convalescent Home
Drive in the spring. This latter appeal involves
more committee appointments and the selection
of more workers than any other Stanford stu
dent enterprise.
It should be obvious from these facts, pre
sented soberly and without any attempt at
dramatization, that this body wields a tremen
dous political force.
When it is known that the minutes of Car
dinals are read to Ex Committee—but that in
cases where disapproval arises "there shall be
a meeting of the A.S.S.U. President with the
Cardinal President and two Cardinals to recon
cile the views"—it should be more obvious that
this body holds unreasonable authority.
Furthermore, the by-law declares that "the
Executive Committee shall only disapprove on
matter of policy or on details if contrary to the
constitution or by-laws."
This writer has no quarrel with any of the
individual members of the organization. But the
influence which this group may exert—an influ
ence far outweighing lis subordinate position
in the A.S.S.U. picture—seems worthy of sharp
criticism.
Cardinals has never been a popular organiza
tion. More than once in recent years it has been
accused of log-rolling. More than once its poli
cies have been seared by campus-wide disap
proval. And, significantly enough. Leadership
Institute has, in the past, censured Cardinals
more firmly than any other group.
Cardinals' most vulnerable point is the fact
that it is self-perpetuating. Its old members ap
point its new members. Other than the limit of
seven seniors or less, no qualifications for ap
pointment are listed constitutionally.
This very means of selection—by naming di
rect successors to present members—tends to
make Cardinals undemocratic. It is a small,
highly centralized, unobtrusive organization. It
is self-perpetuating and powerful beyond all
reason. The path to high political offices often
leads through jobs whose appointments are con
trolled by Cardinals.
These facts should clarify the situation. Car
dinals needs changing. And, while it is impos
sible now for this writer to present a plan for
such revision here, the truth should be plain -
there is no excuse for the existence of an or
ganization drawn on these lines.

It should be obvious from these facts, pre
sented soberly and without any attempt at
dramatization, that this body wields a tremen
dous political force.
When it is known that the minutes of Car
dinals are read to Ex Committee—but that in
cases where disapproval arises "there shall be
a meeting of the A.S.S.U. President with the
Cardinal President and two Cardinals to recon
cile the views"—it should be more obvious that
this body holds unreasonable authority.
Furthermore, the by-law declares that "the
Executive Committee shall only disapprove on
matter of policy or on details if contrary to the
constitution or by-laws."
This writer has no quarrel with any of the
individual members of the organization. But the
influence which this group may exert—an influ
ence far outweighing lis subordinate position
in the A.S.S.U. picture—seems worthy of sharp
criticism.
Cardinals has never been a popular organiza
tion. More than once in recent years it has been
accused of log-rolling. More than once its poli
cies have been seared by campus-wide disap
proval. And, significantly enough. Leadership
Institute has, in the past, censured Cardinals
more firmly than any other group.
Cardinals' most vulnerable point is the fact
that it is self-perpetuating. Its old members ap
point its new members. Other than the limit of
seven seniors or less, no qualifications for ap
pointment are listed constitutionally.
This very means of selection—by naming di
rect successors to present members—tends to
make Cardinals undemocratic. It is a small,
highly centralized, unobtrusive organization. It
is self-perpetuating and powerful beyond all
reason. The path to high political offices often
leads through jobs whose appointments are con
trolled by Cardinals.
These facts should clarify the situation. Car
dinals needs changing. And, while it is impos
sible now for this writer to present a plan for
such revision here, the truth should be plain -
there is no excuse for the existence of an or
ganization drawn on these lines.
CARDINALS, created in 1934 by an Ex Com
mittee by-law, is an administrative sub
committee of the student-body governing board.
As such it controls, almost completely, all par
tisan appointments.
First of all it supervises Rally Committee.
Two of its members are the men's and women's
chairmen of Rally-corn. During a packed au
tumn quarter, Cardinals promotes the Big Game
Rally, jolly-up, parade, and the newly organized
Big Game Dance.
It appoints one of its members chairman of
the Bonfire, the Big Game Dance, and authorizes
the head of Rally Committee to sub-appoint
heads of the parade, the jolly-up, and the rally
itself.
According to Article IV of the Constitution
and By-Laws, it is Cardinals' duty to welcome
visiting celebrities, speakers, athletic teams,
and coaches, and to have charge of all high
school programs for which Stanford speakers
are requested.
In coincidence with game celebrations, Car
dinals sponsors dances during fall quarter and
the rest of the year. Wherever any activity
needs aid, Cardinals is supposedly ready to
assist.
Cardinals, in addition, is responsible for the
campus' two largest drives—the Red Cross
Drive in the fall, and the Convalescent Home
Drive in the spring. This latter appeal involves
more committee appointments and the selection
of more workers than any other Stanford stu
dent enterprise.
