### BUD AMES 
SOMEBODY THROW HIM A FISH
MOST successful week-end, a stiff headache, and
now for the rigors of the coming week. "Konko"
or not, the Stanford gridmen were able to slip a hit
and-run victory over on the Santa Clara prune-pickers.
But credit must be given where credit is due. So
tip your hats to the Santa Clara football team, as fine
a 12-man aggregation as ever took to the gridiron. We
missed his name in the program, but the fellow in the
striped shirt certainly broke away on some beautiful
runs for the Bronco squad. He averaged two yards a
try.
There never was a Stanford rooting section as hop
ping mad as last Saturday's. And all those Stanfordites
weren't boiling just to doing something. There
were definite odors of something dead floating up from
the field. Or else, why did Coach Shaughnessy, who
knows his football as well as you know the grade
point system, take the trouble to walk onto the turf
and complain bitterly to the referee?
Now this doesn't come under the head of ''poor
sportsmanship." Stanford won, and you can consider
yourself lucky. But apparently quite a few of you
rooters got as excited as that referee.

of rooters, last Saturday's section caused
several departed grads to turn over in their graves
for joy. Everybody yelled themselves hoarse; and then
got so mad during the last couple of quarters that they
yelled themselves hoarse all over again. The bellow
ing and neighbor-hugging that burst forth just after
"The Chief" Standlee dove over for our touchdown
will only be surpassed by our winning touchdown in
the Rose Bowl this year.
And maybe you think those cheers don't mean a
lot to our players. Last week, high in the rooting
section, sat a Farm ex-football player. This fellow
couldn't play football this year because of his grades.
As a frosh he had been varsity material. Well, this
benched player was yelling his head off for the team
and for each individual player.
He had heard the shouts of the rooting section
from down on that field. And he realized how much
those shouts help to boost the players over the rough
spots.

'W/'ELL, after all the complaint letters about the wind
shield stickers, very few did much in a construc
tive way about turning in suggestions for better
slogans. The prize one of the few that did turn up
was "BEELINE the FELINE "
The sticker committee isn't thinking of using this
one. But, we can predict that the one they are going
to use will set you thinking.
And—oh, yes—there is a nasty rumor going around
lhat some sweet soul is going to print up a batch of
his own special stickers and then circulate them this
week. The slogan—something about the cougar—just
can't be printed here. So if you spot one of these
"extra" stickers on your windshield, at least now you
won't blame Rally Committee.
