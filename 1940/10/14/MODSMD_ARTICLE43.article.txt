r EDITOR, SIR:
Now I'm not dealing with the question of I.Q.'s
nor am I referring to the comparative ease with which
the striped boys (most likely to succeed) advance the
ball to foreign territory with no apparent opposition.
But I am vitally concerned with the lightning-like
rapidity with which our heroes managed to map out
Stanford's plans of attack, before Stanford had time to
execute them.
Frankly, at last Saturday's game, I experienced that
uncomfortable 60-minute feeling that pretty damn soon
the world was coming to an end with nokJody in charge.
Every time specimen "A" down there would toot a
whistle my scalp would spring a gap allowing cold air
in to slow things down.
Specimen "B," not to be outdone, would toot twice,
pick up the ball, and after a clever bit of calisthenics,
would step out a fast ten. "C," not possessing whistle
or other means of drawing attention to himself,
achieved full notice by entering the fracas himself,
straightway attempting a flying block and shin-kick—
thus proving his nuisance value to the sport.
In view of the fact that Stanford rooters preferred
standing to sitting during this game of games, would
it not be to the B.A.C.'s advantage to hire at least three
more striped shirts (well stuffed) and devote a full
quarter of the game to an organized whistling contest?
