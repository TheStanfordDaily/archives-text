# A 						TOLERANT AMERICA
## 
### 
EDITOR, SIR:
During the past year there has been an increasing
flow of patriotism and devotion for our country from
its people. Culminations of this nationalistic feeling
can be noted in the increased sales of American flags
and in the rise of popular patriotic songs. To the aver
age citizen this surge of Americanism may be taken
for granted; as for me, it warms my heart.
I am able to trace my ancestry back to the birth
of Christ. I am justly proud of my heritage, but I
respect the fact that any person born upon our soil and
who honors our government and flag is just as much
an American as I am. His immediate family may have
been of German, Irish, French, or Japanese blood, but
he, believing in our way of life, is an American to the
core.
Yesterday in Encina Hall I overheard a remark
which made me realize more than ever that Irue
Americans are not only those who can trace their
forefathers back to the landing of the Pilgrims. A boy,
of Japanese blood, said as he read the paper, "Those
Japs are sure raising the devil over there."
Had his skin been as white as mine I might have
forgotten the remark, but coming from him I was
surprised. One might have said, "Look who's talking,
just what are you?" No one did". Nothing was said,
for he was, and is, as American as any of us.
I wonder if the day will ever come when those of
foreign appearance will suffer under the sting of abuse
and ridicule? I speak of America; oppression has
reached practically all nations but ours.
Max Savelle of Stanford has said that "Tolerance is
the most admirable virtue of man." It is; and when
it fails in America it will mean the end of years of
work for freedom.
This writing is the result of a feeling of contempt
I have always had for those who are too quick to con
demn an individual because of his blood. Think
twice; the direction in which a person's loyalty lies is
not necessarily dictated by his blood.
