# SCREECHING AND SCREAMING
## 
### 
r pIE EDITOR, SIR:
I admire the foresight of the University in hold
ing fire drills for Encina. It is something that should
have been done long before; but 1 object to having
the fire trucks rumble by. screeching nnd screaming,
arrive at Encina only to turn directly around and
scream back.
That part of it seems to be just a little far-fetched
and a little inconsiderate toward the rest of the campus.
It may, however, be the firehouse boys' only chance
to lw heroes.
