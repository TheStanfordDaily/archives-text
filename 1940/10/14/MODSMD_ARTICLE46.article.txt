# First Nighters See Sparkling Mozart Opera
## 
### 
The sparkling rococo delicacy of
Mozart opened San Francisco's
eighteenth annual opera season
Saturday night with that composer's
masterpiece of brilliant music, wit,"
and satire, "The Marriage of Figa
ro." Saturday night's performance
brought out all the eighteenth cen
tury refinement of Mozart's orches
tration and song, and the wit and
satire of Da Ponte's libretto.
Elisabeth Rethfcerg as the Coun
tess Almaviva, Bidu Sayao as Su
sanna, and Ezic Pinza as Figaro
rivaled each other so closely in the
perfection of their art that it would
be difficult to choose among them.
Pinza showed that he was in his
best voice in his aria at the end of
the first act, "There Forget Low-
Voiced Prayers, Sweet Alarms," and
he maintained such a vocal standard
throughout the evening.
PRINCIPALS GOOD
Sayao and Rethberg responded to
wave after wave of applause after
their duet in the third act, "Now
Shall I," in which their soprano
voices blended more clearly than
the audience had probably ever
heard before in the ,aria. John
Brownlee made his San Francisco
debut in the character of the Count
Almaviva. ably filling the role with
a full baritone performance and
richly completing the quartet of
the four principal voices of the
opera.
A pleasant "surprise of the eve
ning came from Rise Stevens, also
making her debut. As Cherubino,
page to the Countess, she thrilled
the house with her mezzo-soprano.
Irra Petina amused the audience
as Marcellina in a high, prim wig
and corresponding costume, and
Gerhard Pechner as Susanna's re
jected lover, Dr. Bartolo, brought
forth many laughs. Both of them
were making debuts.
LEINSDORF DIRECTS
The orchestra, under the direc
tion of Erich Leinsdorf, brought out
the logical, orderly, and delicate
spirit of Mozart, never drowning out
the solo voices nor the intricately
woven duets, terzets, sextets, and
chorus finales, tjul letting the soft
passages by contrast bring out the
fortissimo passages of the score.
San Francisco may well be
pleased with its opening night per
formance of Mozart, in contrast to
most first night, melodramatic of
ferings.—Adams

years ago has the hide of a 400-

Saturday night with that composer's
masterpiece of brilliant music, wit,"
and satire, "The Marriage of Figa
ro." Saturday night's performance
brought out all the eighteenth cen
tury refinement of Mozart's orches
tration and song, and the wit and
satire of Da Ponte's libretto.
Elisabeth Rethfcerg as the Coun
tess Almaviva, Bidu Sayao as Su
sanna, and Ezic Pinza as Figaro
rivaled each other so closely in the
perfection of their art that it would
be difficult to choose among them.
Pinza showed that he was in his
best voice in his aria at the end of
the first act, "There Forget Low-
Voiced Prayers, Sweet Alarms," and
he maintained such a vocal standard
throughout the evening.
PRINCIPALS GOOD
Sayao and Rethberg responded to
wave after wave of applause after
their duet in the third act, "Now
Shall I," in which their soprano
voices blended more clearly than
the audience had probably ever
heard before in the ,aria. John
Brownlee made his San Francisco
debut in the character of the Count
Almaviva. ably filling the role with
a full baritone performance and
richly completing the quartet of
the four principal voices of the
opera.
A pleasant "surprise of the eve
ning came from Rise Stevens, also
making her debut. As Cherubino,
page to the Countess, she thrilled
the house with her mezzo-soprano.
Irra Petina amused the audience
as Marcellina in a high, prim wig
and corresponding costume, and
Gerhard Pechner as Susanna's re
jected lover, Dr. Bartolo, brought
forth many laughs. Both of them
were making debuts.
LEINSDORF DIRECTS
The orchestra, under the direc
tion of Erich Leinsdorf, brought out
the logical, orderly, and delicate
spirit of Mozart, never drowning out
the solo voices nor the intricately
woven duets, terzets, sextets, and
chorus finales, tjul letting the soft
passages by contrast bring out the
fortissimo passages of the score.
San Francisco may well be
pleased with its opening night per
formance of Mozart, in contrast to
most first night, melodramatic of
ferings.—Adams
A man who lost his hands seven
years ago has the hide of a 400-
pound bear to prove his prowess as
