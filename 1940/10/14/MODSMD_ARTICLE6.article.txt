# Japan Claims 'Common Ideal' In Axis Union
## Matsuoka Foresees New World Order After Nazi Victory 
### 
TOKYO, Oct. 13 (UP). — Japan
has allied herself with Germany and
Italy because she shares a common
ideal with those powers regarding
the organization of the world into
spheres of economic, political and
military influence. Foreign Minister
Yosuke Matsuoka told a mass meet
ing of more than 50,000 persons
today.
The Foreign Minister vigorously
denied any suggestion that this
country has entered the three
power alliance merely to share in
post-war loot.
FORESEES NEW ORDER
The new world order envisaged
by the three powers, he said, is one
in which economic barriers will be
broken down and the natural geo
graphic divisions of the earth es
tablished in complementary fashion
which will make for the prosperity
of all peoples.
The way is open for the United
States to enter into this new order,
the Foreign Minister said, indicat
ing that the three powers consider
the Americas as a natural sphere
for one of the great world divisions.
"We hope to make the whole
world into one great family," Mat
suoka said. "We three nations, Ja
pan, Germany and Italy, will be
very glad to welcome other powers
into our alliance, whether it be the
United States or any other nation,
should they desire to join in the
spirit of the new order.
CLAIMS COMMON BELIEFS
"However, we firmly are deter
mined to eliminate any nation
which will obstruct our order."
Matsuoka said he believed that
Germany and Italy will win the
European war but that thus belief
was not the reason for the three
power alliance, which, he said, is
based on common conceptions and
common problems.
"In event the war should turn
unfavorable for Germany and Italy,"
he said, "Japan must be prepared
to assist her allies. We must be
prepared to fight with the German
and Italian people."
