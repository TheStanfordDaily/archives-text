# F.D.R. Plans Plane Swap With Britain
## Dykstra Accepts Job As Draft Head; Plan Complete for 'R-Day' 
### 
WASHINGTON. Oct. 13 (UP).—
An authoritative source said to
night that transfer of some of the
Army's famed "flying fortress"
bombers to Great Britain is "on
the fire" and awaits only President
Roosevelt's approval.
The source said that a British pur
chasing mission request for some
of the long range bombers has re
ceived favorable consideration from
high administration officials who
have indicated they were prepared
to recommend the transfer to the
President.
It was emphasized, however, that
the transaction may not be consum
mated for another month or more.
It was considered significant that
Mr. Roosevelt, in his Dayton
speech last night, made it plain
that no combination of dictators
can prevent the United States from
continuing aid to Britain.
Mr. Roosevelt returned from his
defense inspection tour of the Ohio
Valley and prepared to send to the
Senate the nomination of Clarence A.
Dykstra, president of the University
of Wisconsin, as director of con
scription.
DYKSTRA ACCEPTS
Dkystra announced at Madison,
Wis., th;jl he would accept the im
portant draft post. The announce
ment came as selective service offi
cials completed plans for registering
16,404,000 draft age men Wednesday.
It was expected that Dykstra's
nomination would be sent to the Sen
ate early this week—possibly Mon
day—and that favorable action would
be taken later in the week, thus
paving the way for speedy action in
calling the most eligible registrants
to the colors.
Registration will be conducted
from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. Wednesday,
Oct. IG, at 125,000 registration places.
All male citizens of the United
States and all male aliens residing in
this country", between the ages of
21 and 36, are required to register.
BICKER OVER PLANE DEAL
The British purchasing mission
request has stirred opposition in
certain Army quarters which believe
privately that none of the giant four
engine craft can be spared in view
of the international situation. Army
officers have pointed out it takes
months to build one of them.
Some officials supporting the
transfer proposal arc said to feel it
might be well to delay the deal for a
month or more on the theory that
by that time sufficient facilities
probably would be available to pro
duce the big bombers on a greater
scale than now. Thus, it was said,
the Army Air Corps would be as
sured of a steady flow of the newer
types of the "flying fortress."

BICKER OVER PLANE DEAL
The British purchasing mission
request has stirred opposition in
certain Army quarters which believe
privately that none of the giant four
engine craft can be spared in view
of the international situation. Army
officers have pointed out it takes
months to build one of them.
Some officials supporting the
transfer proposal arc said to feel it
might be well to delay the deal for a
month or more on the theory that
by that time sufficient facilities
probably would be available to pro
duce the big bombers on a greater
scale than now. Thus, it was said,
the Army Air Corps would be as
sured of a steady flow of the newer
types of the "flying fortress."
WASHINGTON. Oct. 13 (UP).—
An authoritative source said to
night that transfer of some of the
Army's famed "flying fortress"
bombers to Great Britain is "on
the fire" and awaits only President
Roosevelt's approval.
The source said that a British pur
chasing mission request for some
of the long range bombers has re
ceived favorable consideration from
high administration officials who
have indicated they were prepared
to recommend the transfer to the
President.
It was emphasized, however, that
the transaction may not be consum
mated for another month or more.
It was considered significant that
Mr. Roosevelt, in his Dayton
speech last night, made it plain
that no combination of dictators
can prevent the United States from
continuing aid to Britain.
Mr. Roosevelt returned from his
defense inspection tour of the Ohio
Valley and prepared to send to the
Senate the nomination of Clarence A.
Dykstra, president of the University
of Wisconsin, as director of con
scription.
DYKSTRA ACCEPTS
Dkystra announced at Madison,
Wis., th;jl he would accept the im
portant draft post. The announce
ment came as selective service offi
cials completed plans for registering
16,404,000 draft age men Wednesday.
It was expected that Dykstra's
nomination would be sent to the Sen
ate early this week—possibly Mon
day—and that favorable action would
be taken later in the week, thus
paving the way for speedy action in
calling the most eligible registrants
