### 
LONDON, Oct. 13 (UP). â€”German
air raiders were back on the job
last night and early today, shat
tering buildings in several metro
politan districts and showering
others with incendiary bombs.
Soon after midnight 21 sections
in the London area had been
bombed and the Germans still were
stabbing spasmodically at the outer
defenses of the metropolis, occa
sionally breaking through and drop
ping explosives.
