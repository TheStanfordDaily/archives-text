### BOB LOW 
JJULGARIA and Yugoslavia are
next on Hitler's list.
Germany yesterday demanded
that Yugoslavia agree to participa
tion in "the New Europe" plan
which places European peoples in a
position of subservience to the Axis.
At the same time reports from
Bucharest indicated that German
armed forces would push on into
Bulgaria after sufficient consolida
tion precautions had been taken in
that country.
A German economic mission has
been negotiating in the Yugoslav
capital of Belgrade for several days,
but only yesterday was its enor
mous project disclosed. Economic
experts in Belgrade said that the
demands would strip the country of
its "economic sovereignty."
Two musts on the list of German
demands were said to be especially
damaging to Yugoslav economy:
First, Yugoslavia must cut down
on industrial development in order
to devote more energy to expansion
of her agriculture.
Second, Yugoslavia must grant to
Germany preferential rights to both
industrial and agricultural sur
pluses.
The first demand is significant
because the Germans have been
more than a bit disturbed by an
expanding steel industry in Yugo
slavia. Nazi industry is capable
of supplying the entire Balkan re
gion. but Nazi agriculture evident
ly is being sorely taxed to satisfy
the needs of Greater Germany.
The second demand is less signifi
cant because Germany is already
Yugoslavia's chief customer and
surpluses normally go to Germany.
If Yugoslavia submits to the de
mands, it is probable that Nazi troops
will occupy the country before long
to insure the carrying out of the
provisions in Germany's demands.
If Yugoslavia refuses, it is probable
that Nazi troops (regardless of re
sistance) will occupy the country to
insure the carrying out of the provi
sions in Germany's demands.
* * *
r |' , HE Axis is in a position to put
"the squeeze" on Yugoslavia,
with German troops attacking on the
East from Rumania and on the North
from Austria and with Italians at
tacking from Albania on the South.
Military resistance on the part
of Yugoslavia cannot be counted
upon to slow up to any degree a
crusher action by experienced
troops of the Axis. And it is even
possible that Yugoslavia will not
stand united, since intense rivalry
exists between the Serbs, Croats
and Slovenes who comprise its
population.

/ I ENSORED reports from Bucha-
A rest revealed yesterday more of
the ramifications of a Nazi invasion.
Most spectacular disclosure was that
10 German divisions—lso,ooo men—
have been assigned to Rumania. In
cluded in the same dispatch was the
announcement of the establishment
of several large camps which are
"preparing to receive Jews (several
words censored here)."
Reorganization of the Rumanian
army and protection of oil fields
were German explanations for the
invasion last week. "Reorganization
and protection" in the Nazi way are
evidently going on satisfactorily.

an address broadcast to the na
tion and Latin America last Satur
day that the United States is build
ing an air force and a fleet "suffi
cient to defend all the coasts of the
Americas from any combination of
hostile powers."
The President has made this
known before, it is true, but the
news in a major speech is significant
since it follows closely on the visit
of Latin American military chiefs to
the White House. Plans for greater
co-operation with the American
republics has gone further than
many persons in this country are

an address broadcast to the na
tion and Latin America last Satur
day that the United States is build
ing an air force and a fleet "suffi
cient to defend all the coasts of the
Americas from any combination of
hostile powers."
The President has made this
known before, it is true, but the
news in a major speech is significant
since it follows closely on the visit
of Latin American military chiefs to
the White House. Plans for greater
co-operation with the American
republics has gone further than
many persons in this country are
aware.
Our new policy in the Western
Hemisphere in the words of the
President means that "we shall be
all for one (one republic in the
Western Hemisphere) and one for

JJULGARIA and Yugoslavia are
next on Hitler's list.
Germany yesterday demanded
that Yugoslavia agree to participa
tion in "the New Europe" plan
which places European peoples in a
position of subservience to the Axis.
At the same time reports from
Bucharest indicated that German
armed forces would push on into
Bulgaria after sufficient consolida
tion precautions had been taken in
that country.
A German economic mission has
been negotiating in the Yugoslav
capital of Belgrade for several days,
but only yesterday was its enor
mous project disclosed. Economic
experts in Belgrade said that the
demands would strip the country of
its "economic sovereignty."
Two musts on the list of German
demands were said to be especially
damaging to Yugoslav economy:
First, Yugoslavia must cut down
on industrial development in order
to devote more energy to expansion
of her agriculture.
Second, Yugoslavia must grant to
Germany preferential rights to both
industrial and agricultural sur
pluses.
The first demand is significant
because the Germans have been
more than a bit disturbed by an
expanding steel industry in Yugo
slavia. Nazi industry is capable
of supplying the entire Balkan re
gion. but Nazi agriculture evident
ly is being sorely taxed to satisfy
the needs of Greater Germany.
The second demand is less signifi
cant because Germany is already
Yugoslavia's chief customer and
surpluses normally go to Germany.
If Yugoslavia submits to the de
mands, it is probable that Nazi troops
will occupy the country before long
to insure the carrying out of the
provisions in Germany's demands.
If Yugoslavia refuses, it is probable
that Nazi troops (regardless of re
sistance) will occupy the country to
insure the carrying out of the provi
sions in Germany's demands.

r |' , HE Axis is in a position to put
"the squeeze" on Yugoslavia,
with German troops attacking on the
East from Rumania and on the North
from Austria and with Italians at
tacking from Albania on the South.
Military resistance on the part
of Yugoslavia cannot be counted
upon to slow up to any degree a
crusher action by experienced
troops of the Axis. And it is even
possible that Yugoslavia will not
stand united, since intense rivalry
exists between the Serbs, Croats
and Slovenes who comprise its
population.

Most spectacular disclosure was that
10 German divisions—lso,ooo men—

announcement of the establishment
of several large camps which are
"preparing to receive Jews (several
