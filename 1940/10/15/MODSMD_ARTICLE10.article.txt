# Stanford Poll Covers Campus
## 
### 
How accurate are public opinion j
polls?
This is the question now being [
pondered by political observers as .
they read in the Fortune and Gallup j
Polls that Roosevelt is leading Will
kie in the presidential race by a
large margin. In the 1936 election
the Gallup Poll predicted the popu
lar vote with only 6.9 per cent er
ror; the Fortune poll error was even
less. Both used the weighted sample
method of polling.
The Stanford Daily poll, begun j
last year, is conducted by a similar j
method. A cross-section of the Stan- |
ford campus is compiled scientifically
using a weighted sample.
REG ROLLS USEI)
To compile the cross-section, reg
istration rolls and figures are ex
amined and students are classifiedâ€”
man or woman; Row, Hall, or Inde
pendent; and class. All graduate
students and freshmen are placed in
one category. Graduates attending
medical or nursing school in San j
Francisco or are at the Hopkins Ma- |
rine Station at Pacific Grove are ex- j
eluded. The survey represents oifly \
campus opinion.
After tabulations are complete, ;
each classification is allotted a cer- j
tain percentage of the total sample.
Thus, each classified group is polled |
in proportion to its total representa- ,
tion on campus.
IS PER CENT SOPHS
As an example, there arc about
565 sophomores registered. Thus, 18
per cent of the total sample is com
posed of sophomores. The cross- 1
section is then broken down accord
ing to sex; 66 per cent are men, 34
per cent women. Divisions are made
according to living affiliations.
When completed, the sophomore
j representation in the total sample is
; as follows:
