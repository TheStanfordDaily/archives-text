Tomorrow 1,750 Stanford men register for the draft, as their
fellow students stand by and watch. Seventy-six per cent of all
Farm students approve of conscription, as is indicated by an
opinion survey just completed by The Stanford Daily. Disap
proving of the first peace-time draft in the nation's history are
20 per cent of the students questioned, while 4 per cent are as
yet undecided.
Less unanimity of opinion is found when the students were
asked, "Do you believe wealth should be conscripted as well
as man-power?" "No," answered 53 per cent of the campus
cross-section, "wealth should not be conscripted." But 37 per
cent answered yes and 10 per cent were undecided.
An amazing unity of opinion is revealed when the cross
section is analyzed according to sex.
Approve Disapprove Undecided
Women 77% 20% 3%
Men 76% 20% 4%
Less unity is found among the men. Lower division men ap
pear to favor the measure more strongly than the juniors and
seniors, while the graduate men's opinion is found between the
two groups.
Men Approve Disapprove Undecided
Freshmen 89% 11% 0%
Sophomores 91% 9% 0%
Juniors 62% 23% 15%
Seniors 50% 36% 14%
Graduates 70% 21% 9%
(All percentages less than .5 are considered 0.)
A large number of the students interviewed were hesitant
about registering their undivided approval. Many remarked that
only the present crisis justified the extreme measure. Other
comments were:
"Yes, but not for undergraduates." "Only after volunteers are
enrolled." "It will be good training for them," remarked a sopho
more woman, "and useful, too, if they ever get out."
