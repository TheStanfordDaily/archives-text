# London Has Its Worst Air Attack
## Nazis Move Rapidly To Consolidate Balkan Gains; Turkey Uneasy 
### United Press 
London was under its most vio
lent and spectacular aerial attack
of the .'5B-day German siege Mon
day night and early Tuesday
while, 2,000 miles away at the
other side of Europe, Adolf Hitler
moved rapidly to bring the Bal
kans into his grip.
Not only London but Berlin ap
peared to have been under a siege
of bombs during Monday night, the
Germans reporting what appeared
to have been a brief air x - aid alarm
in their capital although the newly
tightened Nazi censorship choked
off details.
ENGLISH BOMB OBJECTIVES
Britain's bomber squadrons were
climbing the rungs of their "ladder
plan" on counter-blows against the
Reich and Nazi-held Western Eu
rope, importing heavy assaults on at
least 50 Nazi objectives over the
week-end, including "invasion
ports" along the Dutch and Bel
gian coasts.
Russia remained the big red ques
tion mark of the spreading menace
of war in the Balkans and threats
of a double-barreled Italian and
German drive on both rims of the
Mediterranean into Turkey and the
oil fields of Iraq.
SOVIETS OFFER MORAL AID
Anxious regarding Germany's
military moves in Rumania and
threatened penetration into Bul
garia and Jugoslavia, the Soviets
were reported in Bucharest Monday
night to have promised at least
moral support to worried Turkey.
From Belgrade it was reported
Hitler already is spreading out be
yond Rumania and has served de
mands on Jugoslavia to submit to
an Axis-dictated role in the "new
European order."
Although the most heavily armed
of the Balkan nations, Jugoslavia
is almost hopelessly hemmed in by
the Axis powers. â€¢
