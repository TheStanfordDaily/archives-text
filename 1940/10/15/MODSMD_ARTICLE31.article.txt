# Traffic Discussed At Men's Council
## 
### 
For its first "active" meeting of
the year, Men's Council met yes
terday and discussed traffic viola
tions.
"Last week's meeting was con
cerned merely with the election of
officers and adjusting ourselves to
our job," Wilson Cannon, chairman
of Men's Council, explained. "Up
until yesterday we had been let
ting traffic violations go with a
warning."
Speeding offenses appear to cen
ter on the road past Encina and the
B.A.C. Since the Palm Drive en
trance to the University is now un
dergoing construction work, this
road now carries the majority of the
traffic from Palo Alto, and there
fore speeding becomes doubly dan
gerous.
Cannon also reported a number of
overtime parking violations in front
of the Administration Building.
These short-time parking areas are
for the convenience of students and
faculty who have quick business in
the building.
