# Indians Try 'New Stuff' In Practice
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity football team
which so dumbfounded its rooting;
section by sensibly strolling onto
the playing field for last Satur
day's torrid game with the Santa
Clara Broncos did very little
strolling in yesterday's practice.
The whole squad went at full tilt
yesterday in preparation for their
next game with the Washington
State Cougars in Pullman, Wash
ington, next Saturday. The first and
part of the second stringers were
working on some of Coach Clark
Shaughnessy's inevitable "new
stuff," and Conference scouts and
Stanford fans will find out again
next Saturday that they still have
not seen all of the Shaughnessy
system.
TOUCH SCRIMMAGE
Meanwhile part of the second
stringers and the third and fourth
teams went through two hours of
the most fiery scrimmage of the
season.
The reserve backfield of Clyde
Jeffrey and John Casey at halves,
Ray Hammett at quarterback and
Milt Vucinich at fullback looked
quite potent for most of the after
noon, clicking on end runs and
passes in particular,
PETERSON BACK
A welcome figure at this scrim
mage was Thor Peterson, who was
in there pitching them all over the
lot. Thor went into action for the
first time since he got a couple of
libs cracked before the opening
game, and showed his old accuracy
on passing and his usual quick hit
ting power which won him the berth
of second string fullback last year.
Despite the slam-bang blocking
and the vicious tackling during all
60 minutes of last Saturday's long
sought victory over Santa Clara,
every Cardinal man who played es
caped serious injury and only one
wasn't able to suit up for yesterday's
session.
WARNECKE INJURED
This was big Rod Warnecke, who
played about the best game of his
career at tackle against the Broncos.
Rod slightly pulled a muscle and
under the instructions of team phy
sicians Roth and Davies he was tak
ing things easy. However, he will
be back in harness today.
Last Saturday up at Berkeley
Washington State moved into the
rather exclusive ranks of Coast
teams which have won a Confer
ence victory. By virtue of that
popular 9-ti score the Cougars beat
California and have joined Wash
ington and Stanford in the win col
umn.
Evidently stronger than pre
season reports, Washington State is
going to take a lot of sharp pass
defense by the Cardinal backs to
be stopped. Against Cal their most
effective weapon was their aerial
thrusts and they completed 12 out
of 17 tosses.
