BIG CHIEF NORM STANDLEE was "tackled" on the three-yard line
by Bronco Frank Peterson on this play in Saturday's game, but a
little thing like a Santa Clara man doesn't bother Norm. He just
went up and over, as shown, to tack up the Cards' first score-of the
game. A minute later Frankje Albert booted the point-aftcr-touchdown
that beat the Broncos and made Stanford the only undefeated and
untied team on the Coast.
