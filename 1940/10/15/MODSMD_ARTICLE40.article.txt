### JERRY BRUCKER 
ENTERING the Shack through the j
front door for the first time in j
two years, with the unmistakable l
signs of a two-day binge visible on j
his puss, Lucky Louie dropped |
around yesterday to dispense words
of wisdom.
The Lucky One is riding the waves j
of success almost as well as Clark
Shaughnessy's Indian gridders. He ;
stuck out his neck on ten games
Friday morning, and called the turn j
correctly on all but the Nebraska- I
Indiana tussle.
The great Canadian middle man
blames his one butch this week on
inability to avoid a currently pop- !
ular ballad, to wit. "I Can't Get
Indiana Off My Mind."
He said, ''The trouble was, I
couldn't get 'I Can't Get Indiana Off
My Mind' off my mind. That's why j
the prediction came out slightly (
scrambled."
Lighting a cigar that the manag
ing editor had just discarded. Louie I
continued his spiel popping four:
buttons off his vest as he inhaled be
tween sentences.
"Believe me," he bellowed "Stan- !
ford had better be mighty cozy
against those Cougars up at Pull
man this week. Babe lloiling
bcry's crew is always poison on
their home lot no matter how bad
a club they've got." lie stopped for
a moment. "Shakespeare" he
bragged.
(Editor's Note—British authorities 1
decisively stated that the tremor |
that shook Stratford-on-Avon at i
8:26 o'clock, London Time, Monday
evening was definitely NOT caused

by a Nazi bomb. Villagers attributed
the phenomena to another under
ground revolution by "Whirling
Willie" Shakespeare.)
"And this year," Louie continued,
"Washington State has the best team
they've had since they went to the
Rose Bowl back in the pre-Hellenic j
age."
"This passer they've got, name j
of Sewell. the guy that beat Cal j
last week, is tne hottest pitcher in
college ball today. He's the most i
dangerous aerial threat on the !
Coast, may develop into a second !
Sammy Baugh."
Lucky Louie's parting word "was a
warning to keep an eye on that Ore
gon State-Washington gigantic in
Seattle Saturday. The winner of j
(hat. game may be the team that !
Stanford will have to beat to get !
into the Rose Bowl come January 1,
1941. I
Louie's prognosticating record for
the season now reads 16 won, 3 lost,
for a percentage of 84.2.

r things, aside from the actual j
play, stood out Saturday in the i
Stadium.
The Broncos came out for the
pre-game warm-up in old white
sweatshirts. Evidently Buck Shaw
was trying to emphasize the differ
ence between the Santa Clara uni
forms and the Stanford suits.
Coming onto the field before the
game and after the half time rest
period, the Indians walked out
slowly in respect to the blistering
heat. The Broncs dashed onto the
field full of the old college spirit.
