# Papooses Will Face Modesto In Biggest Grid Battle to Date
## 
### 
Two down and four to go.
That's the story for Stanford's frosh gridders who, with a pair of vic
tories under their collective belt, went hack to work yesterday afternoon
in preparation for their tilt with Modesto Junior College in the Stadium
| Saturday.
I The Papoose squad, still on the upgrade, gave evidence in last week-

end's 38-0 victory over
frosh that they have quite a bit of I
what it takes, although Frosh Men
tor Harry Shipkey still does not
think that they are on a par with the
teams of the last two years at this
time in the season. If they keep up ;
the improvement, however, anything
j might, happen.
Should the Shipkeymen down the
; Modesto J. C. eleven they will have
i already won half of their games. Oti j
I following consecutive week-ends j
j they meet the University of South- i
; era California Frosh, Chaffey Junior j
; College, and the University of Cali
| fornia Frosh.
The Trobabes and the Bear Cubs
; always give the Papooses the tough-
I est time, and this season looks to be
|no exception. Although both these
( teams have been hit by the rulings |
jof Edwin N. Atherton, they field
| good outfits.
But right now Coach Shipkey is
forgetting, about the future contests
! and is concentrating on getting his j
j squad in shape to battle the Modesto
elevenâ€”a team that should give the
lrosh the toughest battle they have
had yet.
