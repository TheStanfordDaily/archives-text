# "Pass the Gravy"
## 
### 
CARDINALS is not an ancient satellite in
the A.S.S.U. constellation. It was only six
years ago that Stan Beaubaire proposed the
new group to replace the old rally committee
of which he was then chairman.
And Cardinals, ever since its birth in a storm
of controversy, has been the most widely at
tacked A.S.S.U. body. At the time it was fairly
plain that Cardinals, no matter how new its
title and sincere its avowed purpose, was just
another gravy train on another track.
Beaubaire alone was optimistic. "Although
the new plan takes the political appointments
away from Ex Committee, it does so because
the new method should promote a strictly non
political working committee, not a 'gravy train'
in the slightest sense of the word. It should be
self-sufficient and independent, handling all ac
tivities the Executive Committee wishes to des
ignate to their responsibility, but to the campus
as a whole," he said.
With this well-phrased blessing, Cardinals
ventured forth to take its place in the activities
game.
Soon the organization became a powerful,
closely-knit committee, masked by its identity
as a "semi-official" body, a silent partner of
Ex Committee.
Those who know Ex Committee can testify
to its abhorrence of a negative vote. And when
Cardinals recommendations for committees and
chairmen for such important functions as the
Convalescent Home Drive, after-game dances,
the Red Cross Drive, came before Excom for
approval, there was seldom any dissent. Cardi
nals named them; Ex Committee rubber
stamped them.
It would be difficult to find any grave fault
with this procedure, at least so long as no glar
ing mistakes have been committed and sanc
tioned. But, whether or not efficiency has been
impaired, it is safe to say that it is unhealthy
for one body, almost without check, to have
the power to build candidates for student-body
jobs by grooming them with early committee
posts. This, by its very nature, is a slap at
democratic government.
Of course the principal point of contention
in any criticism of the group is its method of
selecting members. Cardinals is self-perpetu
ating. One year's membership hand-picks the
next year s. With the exception of the four ex
officio members of the board and, possibly, two
or three legitimate appointees, Cardinals mem
bers have been dropped into their jobs by out
going fraternity and club-brothers.
This does not mean that they fail at all times
to do their work well. It should be clear that
this writer has no reason to criticize individuals
who now are members of the group. But, leav
ing names unnamed, the reader need only see
a list of Cardinals members for the past five
years to discover how really self-perpetuating
the group is.
Nine organizations were represented on
Cardinals last year. Those same nine organi
zations, man for man, are represented on this
year's Cardinals.
Three years ago, too, Cardinals was com
posed of approximately half Row men and
women and half Hall men and women. Today
the Row, numerically egual to the Halls, is
represented by 12 members, the Halls by two.
This is no attempt to create a Hall-Row bogey,
than which nothing could be more foolish.
But it should be obvious that the Halls do

not suffer from a lack of competent leadership
when it is true that over half the members of
Ex Committee, elected by the student-body at
large, are affiliated with Hall groups.
Cardinals, under the guise of being a student
body service group, should not be permitted
to develop a hierarchy. They call it nepotism
when favoritism is shown to relatives in the
line of patronage, disbursements, or the con
ferring of favors; at Stanford they call it "Cardi
nals' democracy."
