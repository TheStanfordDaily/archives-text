THE NEWSPAPERS NEVEIi LIE—ALL THE TIME
HEADLINE on the sports page of yesterday's San
Francisco Chronicle read "Unbeaten Cards Stalk
Cougars. Brother, that ain't all the Cards are going to
do to the cougar. Somebody certainly missed the point.

For accurate, up-to-the-minute coverage of all the
news always read your Daily. Yesterday this local rag
splurged the front page with a story all about how
"The Poor of New York" is going to open the Farm
fall footlight season—or do you prefer fall Farm foot
light season—come this Thursday. On the back page
of the same issue was a one-paragraph story headed
"British Kill 3000." Oh, well, what are 3000 lives?
Just to show you that the English feel the same
way, here is a Jittle poem reprinted through the kind
permission of a British Tommy who swam the wrong
way at Dunqerque and whom they hauled out of the
Brooklyn estuary yesterday—still swimming like hell.
Quote:
This killing Germans by the score,
It gets to be an awful bore.
The Daily only puts us on page four.
So all you blighters grab your gun;
We'll chop these Germans by—by the ton.
Forward, men; on, On, ON. ON to page one.
Unquote.
HPHE campus student leaders thought it over for quite
a while and then decided to get in step with the
government. Which is lucky for the government.
But praise, sincere praise is due to Bill Turner and
all the boys (no, lady, it isn't a swing band) who con
ceived and gave birth to this program which will
assist all Stanfordites eligible for the draft to sign up
with greater ease, and with a better understanding of
what the government is putting over on them.
But down at U.C.L.A. a group of about 200 students
(you can't call it a crowd at Ucla until you get to
gether at least 25.000 of the enrolled students) —well,
anyway, a group of about 200 students threw together
a few signs and messed around for a time in protest
to the draft. Their placards dribbled such Winchell
isms as "Peace Never Killed Anyone" and "There's No
Future in Flanders."
No doubt their protests will bring about the imme
diate reversal of all the government's plans of ever
having a draft.
If you want to get the same effect as those U.C.L.A.
students, take your lunch hour off every Monday, Wed
nesday, and Friday, and spend the time running up
against a stone wall. Head-first is twice as much fun.

A front page headline in last Saturday's Paly Times
read "NAZI BAYONETS FLASH IN RUMANIAN
CITY." That is what is known as a flash in the pants.
