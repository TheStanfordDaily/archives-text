# CAMPUS OPINION
## RANK DISCRIMINATION 
### 
r rilE EDITOR. SIR:
Since Bud Ames, "the defender of lost souls,"
overlooked us in his column yesterday, we feel that
we must make a very strong protest to the 8.A.C., the
Rally Committee, and others concerned.
j Perhaps some of the Stanford rooters noticed a
group of ardent follow rooters seated at the edge of
the reserved section fence Saturday. These boys had
formed their own "S" with their rooters' caps and
cheered very vociferously when it was possible to see
through the fence.
This group consisted of 1(> Stanford students who
had worked before the game ;ind then were not al
lowed into the rooting section. We were allowed to
go to our rightful place in the rooting section last
week but were denied entrance last Saturday.
This seems to be discrimination when student body
members can not sit in their own section simply be
cause they gave up their time to work for the B.A.C.
We are not even allowed to purchase rooters' tickets
for the U.S.C. game so that we'll have a seat reserved.
If there is some good reason for this action, we
would be satisfied but as far as we can see, there
isn't. Could something be done about this discrimi
nation?
