# PLUG YOUR EARS

'I'M IE EDITOR, SIR:
Rudely Awakened, we are sorry that we dis
turbed your slumber, but please remember that we do
not look forward to getting up early in the morning
any more than you do. While you are in a comfort-
bed, we are riding in the cold morning air to
answer calls over which we have no control.
Would suggest that you go to bed earlier and get
up earlier (Ben Franklin), or pull the covers over your
head.
Yours for more peaceful slumbers, we hope,
The Firehouse Boys
