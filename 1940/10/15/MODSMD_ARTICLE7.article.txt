JDEAS SOUGHT
Anyone who has written a song is
urged to come over. Though the
committee would prefer that the
songs be on paper, it is all right for
the composers to just come over and
play and sing them.
"If you can't sing, maybe it would
be better, for the song's sake, to
bring someone who can," Muheim
said.
As for the skits, it is not neces
sary to have the whole thing. Bring
even the most nebulous ideas, and
Gagman A1 Zelver will be present
to bring them into some sort, of con
crete condition, he added.
RELAXATION' OFFERED
On hand to hear the various con
tributions will be Ray Stahl, Pie
Thornton. Dana Winters, Tony Cef
aratti, and Pete Wangenheim, mem
bers of the production committee,
and Hal Moreno, musical director.
Emphasizing the come-one-come
all nature of the tryouts, Muheim
concluded, "Come on over; it'll be
nice relaxation for draft registrants."
