## 
### 
"The only constant thing at Stan
ford is change," said President Ray
Lyman Wilbur when he spoke to the
Faculty Women's Club yesterday on
the celebration of Stanford's fiftieth
anniversary and the 50 years to
come.
In reviewing the first 50 years of
Stanford life, Dr. Wilbur read nu
merous articles from Volume I of
the Stanford Sequoia which sketched
pre-Stanford history, its ideals, and
the amount the modern university
plays in American life. He noted
the difficulties in professor-student
relations which ended in the pro
fessors holding open house for the
students.
In conclusion. Dr. Wilbur stated
that if Stanford can be as free for
the next 50 years as it has been for
the last, America as a nation has
nothing to fear.
