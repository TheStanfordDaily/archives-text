# Stuart to Speak On KPO Tonight
## 
### 
Graham Stuart, professor of po
litical science, will speak on the
Stanford Hour over KPO at 7:30
o'clock tonight. An authority on
diplomacy, Professor Stuart will dis
cuss the importance of public opin
ion in formulating America's foreign
policies.
Lack of public understanding has
always been a handicap to intelligent
legislation, according to Professor
Stuart. He will cite as examples of
acts "rushed through Congress by a
stampeded public opinion" the arms
embargo and the cash-and-carry
statute.
Professor Stuart was a delegate
to the third Pan-American Scientific-
Congress in 1925, and is the author
of several books on diplomacy and
international affairs.
