## Photographs on Student Body Cards Considered to Foil Illegal Transfer; Revival of Lecture Series Debated 
### M. J. MONTGOMERY 
Ex Committee tipped the Cardinals gravy-boat last night and author
ized a sub-committee to overturn it completely.
Sentiment of the committee was fhat the system of appointment is al
fault, although several arguments pointed out the failure of Ex Committee
to challenge appointments representing the same organizations as those

>of the outgoing members.
Among the suggestions for cor
rection was John Porter's that ap
pointments be made by a joint, meet -
ing of Executive Committee and
Cardinals members. At present,
there is no definite provision in the
A.S.S.U. by-laws.
FAMILY CALL: Chairman Bob
recommendations were re
duced to the appointment of a
council consisting of Sylvia Berry,
Jack Burns, Lois Whitmore, and
John Moore.
PEACE DAY: Following Dr. Wil
bur's repeated suggestion that Peace
Day not be called Peace Day, Ex
Committee renamed the program
World Affairs Day. In the minority
were those expressing (he opinion
that such a change in nomenclature
was an admission as frank as calling
it "War Day."
A.S.S.U. LECTURES: H. K. Knick
erbocker, Pierre Von Paassen, and

men following investigation of the
calendar.
STUDENT BODY CARDS: It was
proposed that pictures be used on
student body cards to prevent vio
lation of the non-transferable clause.
The question has long been a
problem for both Men's and Wom
en's Councils, and their policy lias
not been consistent. "It's high time
we decided once and for all whethrr
its is an Honor Code case or not,"
said Bruce Jessup.
MEN'S VOCOM: Frank Mallory
