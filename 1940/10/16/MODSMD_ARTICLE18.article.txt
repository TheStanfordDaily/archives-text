# Orating Grad Boosts Utopia
## 
### 
Stanford toppled off its pedestal
yesterday and climbed onto a soap
box. Minus a Sather Gale, Oran A.
Petree, Stanford 1903, parked his
antiquated bicycle in front of the
precinct of the Libe and within
shouting range of the office of the
President, proclaimed that moncy
should be a public utility.
Elderly and Babbitt-like, the spry
little gentleman pleaded with the
ring of confused students, claiming
his plan will bring an economic
Utopia. Put a tax on money to make
more money, redistribute that money
and other goods and everybody will
be happy. To the query of how he
would keep prices down, the ped
dling economist repiled, "Oh, things
will keep them down."
With the winds of freedom still
blowing gently about the soft
spoken prophet, he pointed a gnarled
finger up the Libe stairs and claimed
it contained his philosophy in full.
Just read "Why the New Deal Can't
Stop the Depression" by Oran A.
Petree, he said. "The answer is
there; go get it."
