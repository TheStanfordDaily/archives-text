IVATIONAL Registration Day . . .
October 16, 1940.
Today some 16 million young
Americans will register under the
Selective Service and Training Act
to render themselves available for
conscription.
Americans feel that the day is im
portant; it is something new and
one-eighth of the country's popula
tion will take part.
But perhaps Americans are little
aware that National Registration
Day here is being watched with
great interest by people all over
the world.
Most Americans no longer are
neutral in their attitude toward the
European War. Few have felt they
were doing anything to transfer their
convictions to actions.
But tomorrow millions of men in
tlie United States unwittingly are
expressing their desire to see a vic
tory for Britain and the life for
which she stands.
* ~ •
I JITLER has on several occasions
expressed his opinion of the
American nation and its democratic
government in rather definite terms.
He considers Americans weak, in
capable of quick decision, and in
brief no match for his "streamlned"
.state.
Registration of 16 million Ameri
cans for patriotic service will not go
unnoticed in Nazi government cir
cles. Hitler himself now knows
America's answer to his cries of
American weakness.
While government censorship in
Germany may keep the news from
its population, Britishers defend
ing England will read about Amer
ica's registration program with
elation. Britain is aware that a
peace-time draft in (he United
States cannot make Ilitler happy
—even if materially it will put him
at no further disadvantage.
So registration today of millions
of Americans will be a tremendous
boost, if only morally, to Britains
Inking upon America as a friend.
Compulsory service in the United
States will be distasteful to some
who are drafted, but many of these
persons fail to recognize that young
men in totalitarian nations are
forced to give up a great deal more.
Dr. Wilbur's recent comment on the
draft well expresses the attitude of
those who conceived the draft:
"It is a terrible blow to be sub
jected to conscription in peace-time,
but if that is the price of freedom,
the sacrifice is worthwhile."

.state.
Registration of 16 million Ameri
cans for patriotic service will not go
unnoticed in Nazi government cir
cles. Hitler himself now knows
America's answer to his cries of
American weakness.
While government censorship in
Germany may keep the news from
its population, Britishers defend
ing England will read about Amer
ica's registration program with
elation. Britain is aware that a
peace-time draft in (he United
States cannot make Ilitler happy
—even if materially it will put him
at no further disadvantage.
So registration today of millions
of Americans will be a tremendous
boost, if only morally, to Britains
Inking upon America as a friend.
Compulsory service in the United
States will be distasteful to some
who are drafted, but many of these
persons fail to recognize that young
men in totalitarian nations are
forced to give up a great deal more.
Dr. Wilbur's recent comment on the
draft well expresses the attitude of
those who conceived the draft:
"It is a terrible blow to be sub
jected to conscription in peace-time,
but if that is the price of freedom,
the sacrifice is worthwhile."
IVATIONAL Registration Day . . .
October 16, 1940.
Today some 16 million young
Americans will register under the
Selective Service and Training Act
to render themselves available for
conscription.
Americans feel that the day is im
portant; it is something new and
one-eighth of the country's popula
tion will take part.
But perhaps Americans are little
aware that National Registration
Day here is being watched with
great interest by people all over
the world.
Most Americans no longer are
neutral in their attitude toward the
European War. Few have felt they
were doing anything to transfer their
convictions to actions.
But tomorrow millions of men in
tlie United States unwittingly are
expressing their desire to see a vic
tory for Britain and the life for
which she stands.

expressed his opinion of the

government in rather definite terms.
He considers Americans weak, in
