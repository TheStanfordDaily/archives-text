No novice in the production of this
show, Mr. Vance has had notable

.summer and it was received with
acclaim and with houses packed on
all nights.
C AST PLEASES VANCE
Garrett Starmer, who plays the
hfto in the Stanford production, also
played under Mr. Vance in his pro
ductions back East. "Of course, the
facilities there were not so abun
dant," said Mr. Vance. "The play
was put on there on a much smaller
wale, necessitating a smaller cast."
The Stanford cast for the Bouci
eault play is the largest Mr. Vance
lias ever handled for the show. "I
am more than pleased with the good
material that turned out for the
show," he announced. "I am a
stranger here, but the co-operation
1 have met with is more than grati-"

Mr. Vance also praised the facili
ties Stanford's theater offers, saying
that he considers it one of the finest
college plants in the country.
Tlie last time Mr. Vance presented
"The Poor of New York" he had to
whip it in shape in five days for
the first of the summer plays. It
set the pace for the summer season.
The spontaneity of presentation made
for audience co-operation in the
form of "boos" and "bravos," which
have been urged here as well.

Mr. Vance wished to announce
that he is especially grateful for the
co-operation of the Glee Club, in
particular to Joel Carter for his ex
cellent training of the male quartet

participation in the love duo, another
oleo.
