# Author Kennedy Follows Killefer's Recommendation
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
When Jack Kennedy, late of the
London School of Economics and
Harvard, now of the Stanford School
of Business, returned to the United
Slates from England in October of
'38, he found the near-unanimous
condemnation of Chamberlain and
the Munich pact far from under
standable. >
So he wrote a book called '"Why
England Slept." Published in July
of this year, it is already on the
best-seller lists, has gone through
three printings, and is slated for
English publication soon.
PLAN OF BOOK
"You can't condemn in retrospect;
the decisions of the men responsible
must be considered in the light of
the whole English psychological at
titude at the time when the decisions
were made," he said in an inter
view yesterday. "The book is an
attempt to trace the growth of the
war sentiment in England in both
the ruling classes and the common
people from 1931 on."
Kennedy, the second son of Joseph
Kennedy, U.S. Ambassador' to the
Court of St. James, came to Stan
ford after three and a half under
grud years at Harvard and six
months at the University's of Lon
don's School of Economics.
KILLEFER'S INFLUENCE
"I picked Stanford principally be
cause of your ex-Student Body
President and Student Manager Tom
Ki liefer. He was my brother's
roommate at Harvard, and he
sneered so at the Florida climate
when he was slaying with us there
that I had to find out if it really was
the climate or just Killefer," he
grinned. "So far he's right, but wait
till I see that first cloud . . ."
"Why England Slept" was writ
ten during its author's senior year
in college. According to him it has
two purposes (a) to attempt an ex
planation of just why England was
not prepared; (b) to show the star
tling similarity between English and
American lack of preparedness.
ACCESS TO SOURCES
Through his father, Kennedy says,
he had unusual opportunities to gain
access to the persons and informa
tion discussed in the book. "Inci
dentally, I understand they're
ing Dad 'America's most bombed
ambassador' now," he remarked.
"That's a helluva title, isn't it?"

An honor student in international
relations, he plans to go into some
form of business law. So far, his
schedule is a year in the business
school here, and then a second grad
year at Yale Law School. He will
serve as a member of Stanford's
National Emergency Committee
during his year here.
LIKES STANFORD
Stanford, he likes unequivocally—
and the football team is included.
According to Kennedy, "you have
no idea how it feels to yell for a
winning team." (The classes of '41,
'42, and '43 will probably have some
notion of what he means.) At any
rate, he was amazed at the rooting
section's spirit, and thinks the wom
en probably have something to do
v/ith it.
"At Harvard, whenever they ask
for undergraduate opinion on what
would improve the school, about 80
per cent of the suggestions are to
make the school coeducational." He
pondered this for a second. "I think
I'll have one of my sisters come
here," he said.

religious symbol.

Harvard, now of the Stanford School
of Business, returned to the United
Slates from England in October of
'38, he found the near-unanimous
condemnation of Chamberlain and
the Munich pact far from under
standable. >
So he wrote a book called '"Why
England Slept." Published in July
of this year, it is already on the
best-seller lists, has gone through
three printings, and is slated for
English publication soon.
PLAN OF BOOK
"You can't condemn in retrospect;
the decisions of the men responsible
must be considered in the light of
the whole English psychological at
titude at the time when the decisions
were made," he said in an inter
view yesterday. "The book is an
attempt to trace the growth of the
war sentiment in England in both
the ruling classes and the common
people from 1931 on."
Kennedy, the second son of Joseph
Kennedy, U.S. Ambassador' to the
Court of St. James, came to Stan
ford after three and a half under
grud years at Harvard and six
months at the University's of Lon
don's School of Economics.
KILLEFER'S INFLUENCE
"I picked Stanford principally be
cause of your ex-Student Body
President and Student Manager Tom
Ki liefer. He was my brother's
roommate at Harvard, and he
sneered so at the Florida climate
when he was slaying with us there
that I had to find out if it really was
the climate or just Killefer," he
grinned. "So far he's right, but wait
till I see that first cloud . . ."
"Why England Slept" was writ
ten during its author's senior year
in college. According to him it has
two purposes (a) to attempt an ex
planation of just why England was
not prepared; (b) to show the star
tling similarity between English and
American lack of preparedness.
ACCESS TO SOURCES
Through his father, Kennedy says,
he had unusual opportunities to gain
access to the persons and informa
tion discussed in the book. "Inci
dentally, I understand they're
ing Dad 'America's most bombed
ambassador' now," he remarked.
"That's a helluva title, isn't it?"

An honor student in international
relations, he plans to go into some
form of business law. So far, his
schedule is a year in the business
school here, and then a second grad
year at Yale Law School. He will
serve as a member of Stanford's
National Emergency Committee
during his year here.
LIKES STANFORD
Stanford, he likes unequivocally—
and the football team is included.
According to Kennedy, "you have
no idea how it feels to yell for a
winning team." (The classes of '41,
'42, and '43 will probably have some
notion of what he means.) At any
rate, he was amazed at the rooting
section's spirit, and thinks the wom
en probably have something to do
v/ith it.
"At Harvard, whenever they ask
for undergraduate opinion on what
would improve the school, about 80
per cent of the suggestions are to
make the school coeducational." He
pondered this for a second. "I think
I'll have one of my sisters come
here," he said.
