# Varsity Gridsters Work Pass Defenses on Frosh; Squad at Full Strength
## 
### 
With an eye to stopping Washington State's one-man offense. Bill
Sewell, who loves to throw that football all over the lot, the high riding
Stanford varsity drilled intensively on pass defense yesterday.
Freshmen backs. Joe iVlardesicli, Boh Kock, and Boh Micholl took
turns imitating the passing Cougar, and Coach Harry Shipkey directed

his freshmen in a passing
l'«3r the benelit of the varsity. Both |
the first and second strings took j
their turns at stopping a variety of j
aerial thrusts following the pattern ;
of the W.S.C. pass offense.
HOD WARNECKE BACK
Yesterday Stanford's footballers
reached a peak in physical condi
lion. Wtih rangy Rod Warnecke
back in uniform after his one day
rest, every Indian is in playing con
dition and the squad is at full
strength for the Cougar tilt.
Coach Clark Shaughnessy can't
overemphasize the clanger of the i
northerner's passing attack for it
gained 193 yards against the U.S.C.
Trojans in that startling 14-14 tie
pulled off by the Cougars. And it
was largely responsible for the vic
tory over California when the deadly
Sewell completed 12 out of 17
tosses. According to Assistant Coach
Jim Lawson, the only reason Sewell
didn't bat 100 per cent in this game
was because his receivers dropped a
couple, for all his pitches were ac
curate.
STRONG COUGAR LINE
In Chuck Taylor and Bruno Ban
ducci, Shaughnessy has two of the
finest weapons to stop a good pass
ing attack—a couple of hard charg
ing linemen. If these two can keep
Sewell worried and his passes hur
ried, his efficiency will be cut in
half.
However, this year Coach Babe
Hollingbery of the Cougars has a
strong line and good reserves for the
line, which is rather unique for
Washington State; and if this line
can hold the charge of the Indians
long enough to let Sewell get his
spirals away, look out for fireworks.
STANDLEE'S RIVAL
• Sewell has been set up by the
northern sports writers as another
kicking rival for Norm Standlee. He
pulled a couple of 60-yard punts
out of the bag against California,
but he isn't as consistent as the
"Chief."
The first two strings mixed in a
little offense with their pass defense
in yesterday's practice session. Al
ways present in the minds of the
Cards coaches this week has been
the threat of a wet field next Sat
urday up north. The Shaughnessy
system has yet to meet the test of
a muddy turf and a slippery ball
but the "Old 'Master Mind" Shaugh
nessy is bound to have a solution
up his sleeve for this highly possible
situation.
