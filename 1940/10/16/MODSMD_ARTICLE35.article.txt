# Frosh Practice Pass Offensive
## 
### 
The Papoose passing attack that
paid dividends last week-end re
ceived more attention yesterday
afternoon as the yearling lirst
stringeis Hashed their aerial at
tack against the Stanford var
sity.
On the tossing end of the passes
I were Bob Mitchell and Bob Koch,
; who tossed to Jim Ellis. Bill Bru-
I baker, and Jack Reynolds. The ;
j practice session gave the varsity 1
j gridders a workout on pass defense, ,
which may come in handy when
they run up against Washington
1 State's vaunted air attack.
Meanwhile, the rest of the frosh j
1 footballers worked on offensive ma- J
neuvers for use against Modesto j
J. C. this Saturday. Although â– 
Coach Harry Shipkey had given his
| charges some "T" formation plays I
j before the U.C.L.A. frosh game, j
they did not use them then. This
week-end, however, it is quite prob
able that they will use their new
j formation, according to Shipkey.
Today's drill will feature a pass
j scrimmage, in which each team will
; be allowed only one running play
j during each series of downs.
