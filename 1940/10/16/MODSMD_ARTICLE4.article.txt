# Nazis Drive 30-hour Raid Over London
## German Planes Blast Through Thunderous Defense Barrages 
### 
LONDON, Wednesday, Oct. 16
(UP). â€”Light and heavy German
bombers bucked through Ix>n
don's most thunderous anti-air
craft barrage last night and early
today, sometimes at the rate of
one a minute, to continue the
devastating raids which allowed
the capital but meager respite for
more than 30 hours.
After the lightning ferocity of the
evening attack had subsided for a
time, solitary raiders threatened the
skies early today. Swerving and
dipping to frustrate the sound ap
paratus directing the deafening bar
rage, they scattered bombs which
boosted the surging casualty lists.
From central London the night
assault as a whole appeared to be
slightly less intensive than that of
Monday night, which was the worst
of the 39-day siege.
Shortly before midnight 25 Lon
don districts and as many in the
provinces, including the Midlands
and a southwest coast town, had
been bombed since the raiders swept
in at nightfall.
