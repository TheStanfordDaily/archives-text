# Bellwether on Brew
## 
### 
WQEE what I mean?" Bellwether said. "You
0 won't be able to buy another drink unless
you're 21."
It seemed as if Bellwether was right. But
Bellwether had always been convincing.
The newly-returned sage of Stanford punched
his point home with energetic wags of a banana
like forefinger. "No denying it. Not 21 years
old eguals no registration card. No registration
card eguals no brew. Simple mathematics.
Even you should be able to get it."
1 got it. Bellwether's logic is of the steam
roller type. From the moment the long, sharp,
somewhat blistered Bellwether nose had pro
pelled itself around the corner of the Cellar
booth it had been clear that Emery was nursing
a new brainchild.
The first feeling of surprise at seeing him
back at the Farm had been casually waved aside
by this truant from the brain trust. First thought
was that a nightmarish replica of Bellwether
had ambled through the door. But the loose
jointed figure of this modern Ichabod Crane was
unmistakable. Especially when he folded him
self into the booth and finished my coke and a
cigarette.
The sudden pointing of an elongated finger
in my direction had been his first recognition.
"Say," were his first words. "Are you 21?"
Typical Bellwether. The frame might have
rusted, but the brain was still there, as crisp and
crackling as it had been under his "adoption"
by Allen Drury, talented Daily Bullsessioner of
two years ago. The movement of the wheels
within-wheels behind the thick horned-rims that
were the Bellwether trademark could almost
be seen.
Removing the nail of the Bellwether fore
finger from my left eye had preluded the in
dignant answer that I was 21. "Yes, Bell
wether," I had sighed, "I did register this morn
ing if that's what you're driving at."
Emery had grown indignant at that cutting
insinuation. "Tush-tush, lad, important but inci
dental, that business of registering. Important
but incidental."
"Yes, Bellwether, of course. But, what new
theory are you fathering?"
Still in revery, I thought with reverence of the
newest foundling from the. Bellwether brain.
Each successive point in his logic had leaped
from the Bellwether tongue with machine-like
precision . . . punctuated meanwhile with rapid
waggings of that irrepressible Bellwether fore
finger.
"Emery," I said, coming back to normal, "give
me that again, will you?"
Bellwether is always happy to oblige. "Here
it is. Simple as shelling peanuts.
"You walk into a brew factory. What do they
ask you?"
That took some thought. Then . . . "What'll
you have?"
Bellwether winced. "Imbecile. They ask you
how old you are."
Yes, Emery. Then, of course, you say you're
21. So what?"
The mastermind whipped another cigarette
from my package. From behind the match
came, "Think through this thing, lad. They ask
you for your registration card!" Bellwether saw
that hadn't sunk in. "Your draft card, the one
they gave you this morning, see?"
My blush was a compliment to the astuteness
of this American Confucius. "Granted, Emery.
But of course I say I've left the card in my other
slacks."

Emery couldn't resist the opening. "You don't
have another pair of slacks," he commented,
reaching what I thought was the only weak part
of my argument. But the reprieve was short.
"Besides, lad," Bellwether continued, "they ar
rest you when you don't have your card."
"What, that's impossible!"
"True, lad, it's all too true. No registration
card means you're a draft evader. They put you
in jail for that. Strong jails with bars on the
windows. Iron bars, of course."
Bellwether had won again. As usual the
sage's logic had carried the day. With me still
grasping at the inevitability of the Bellwether
logic, the sage gathered himself to his feet and
swiftly scooped the remainder of my cigarettes
into his trousers pocket.
"See you soon, lad," he said. "Think it over.
What comes after 39?"
"40."
"Life begins! Tally-ho."â€”W. C.
