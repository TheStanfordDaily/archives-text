### BUD AMES 
M' DAY—AS IN FORWARD MARCH'

W/ELL, today is the day of days. Everything pops to
day since this happens to be October 16. 1940, or
visa versa. This is "M" day, which can stand for mad
house or moron day.
Lets see; on the happy side of the picture we find
that Rams Head starts off today to try out songs and
skits for the Gaieties which Director Harry Quagmire
Muheim threatens to release on all you unsuspecting
readers come this November 29. Despite what you
have been hearing, the show may turn out to be a
"goodie."
"From my far distant position, I may safely say
that this year's Gaieties looks like it is going to be
even better than last year's." These jolly glad tidings
were spread yesterday by Charlie Bulbbotti—oops, that
should be Bulotti—last year's director, who is infamous
for his "I-can-safely-say" quotations. And he certainly
was safe in making such a statement.
* * * *
on the unhappy side of the picture, you have
the Chaparral, campus phoney magazine, which
you will find four salesgirls deep on every corner of
the Quad this morning. The jokes in this issue are
all good. They were good last year, so why not now?
And—oh, yes, this column wishes to relay a call
issued yesterday afternoon by Chaparral Editor Ken
Smith to all women who are going to act as salesgirls
this morning. The call reads: (quote) "All salesgirls
should contact (?) me early this morning to get your
copies. Please bring a heavy sock filled with sand."
(unquote)
But all kidding aside, buy a copy of "Chappie" even
if it's only to keep off the other salesmen. The maga
zine gets better eveiy year.
* >|i * *
Back on the happy (or are you a Row man?) side,
tonight Coach, Coach Clark, Coach Clark Shaugh
nessy will address a mess of Encinaites who will be
the guests of Interclub Council at a smoker in the
Toyon Lobby.
A lot of stalwart frosh material will probably dis
appear in that smoke screen.
* » • ♦
by golly, we almost forgot it in the rush—for
the nearest tramp steamer sailing for Hawaii.
This is Registration Day. Yep, yep, yes siree. This is
Registration Day.
If in any doubt about all this signing up business,
just pant over to one of the eight registering rooms
on the campus. The gentlemen there will be glad to
solve all your problems for the next year. May we
suggest that you ask your questions on the dead run.
Added note: Individual bottles of disappearing ink
will be sold at the entrance of all registration booths.
That's the answer to everything.

Back on the happy (or are you a Row man?) side,
tonight Coach, Coach Clark, Coach Clark Shaugh
nessy will address a mess of Encinaites who will be
the guests of Interclub Council at a smoker in the
Toyon Lobby.
A lot of stalwart frosh material will probably dis
appear in that smoke screen.

by golly, we almost forgot it in the rush—for
the nearest tramp steamer sailing for Hawaii.
This is Registration Day. Yep, yep, yes siree. This is
Registration Day.
If in any doubt about all this signing up business,
just pant over to one of the eight registering rooms
on the campus. The gentlemen there will be glad to
solve all your problems for the next year. May we
suggest that you ask your questions on the dead run.
Added note: Individual bottles of disappearing ink
will be sold at the entrance of all registration booths.
That's the answer to everything.
M' DAY—AS IN FORWARD MARCH'

W/ELL, today is the day of days. Everything pops to
day since this happens to be October 16. 1940, or
visa versa. This is "M" day, which can stand for mad
house or moron day.
Lets see; on the happy side of the picture we find
that Rams Head starts off today to try out songs and
skits for the Gaieties which Director Harry Quagmire
Muheim threatens to release on all you unsuspecting
readers come this November 29. Despite what you
have been hearing, the show may turn out to be a
"goodie."
"From my far distant position, I may safely say
that this year's Gaieties looks like it is going to be
even better than last year's." These jolly glad tidings
were spread yesterday by Charlie Bulbbotti—oops, that
should be Bulotti—last year's director, who is infamous
for his "I-can-safely-say" quotations. And he certainly
was safe in making such a statement.
* * * *
on the unhappy side of the picture, you have
the Chaparral, campus phoney magazine, which
you will find four salesgirls deep on every corner of
the Quad this morning. The jokes in this issue are
all good. They were good last year, so why not now?
And—oh, yes, this column wishes to relay a call
issued yesterday afternoon by Chaparral Editor Ken
Smith to all women who are going to act as salesgirls
this morning. The call reads: (quote) "All salesgirls
should contact (?) me early this morning to get your
copies. Please bring a heavy sock filled with sand."
(unquote)
But all kidding aside, buy a copy of "Chappie" even
if it's only to keep off the other salesmen. The maga
zine gets better eveiy year.
