## NO, WERE NOT WONDERING

HPHE EDITOR, SIR:
Has Wendell Willkie really found the key issue
that is to unlock the doors of the White House for
him? There is a growing feeling throughout the
country that his attacks upon the administration's
past foreign policy is more than mere political rag
chewing. Are you wondering as I'm wondering why
our military helplessness came as a sudden hair-raising
revelation to our government? Now that the mad rush'
of defense legislation has stormed through Congress
American people are asking if an administration un
able to foresee this crisis is capable of leading us
through it?
