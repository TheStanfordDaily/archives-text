# ATTENTION RALLYCOM

r EDITOR, SIR:
I have a combination request and suggestion to
make. I am making it to you because I feel that
you will not only be interested in the proposition, but
will be able to do something about it.
For as long as I can remember, Stanford has always
been a most ungracious host at football games. Every
year, either the U.S.C. or the U.C.L.A. rooters are
forced to sit on the sunny side of the field. When
Stanford goes South, they always are given the shady
side of the stadium.
From all I have been able to gather there will be
a tremendous crowd of S.C. rooters in Palo Alto for
the game. It is almost two weeks away, but already
S.C. people are complaining because they expect to
sit with the sun in their eyes once more.
Last year at S.C. the two rooting sections became
quite friendly before the game was over. In fact, this
spirit was almost a high spot in last year's barren
football schedule. Don't you think it's about time to
play the thoughtful host, and keep up Stanford's solid
reputation in the South? If we don't S.C. will be
yelling across the field at us, but it won't be "Hoy-hoy,"
'Chop chop," and "Well all right."
