r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
In niy opinion you have done an injustice to
Cardinals!
Cardinal members certainly deserve all the glory
they earn, for they spend hours doing hard, unpubli
cized jobs. The mere fact that the Cardinals must be
good workers demands that this organization be self
perpetuating.
How many students know who the Cardinal mem
bers are? Surely, they know that the two Rally Com
mittee chairmen and the head yell leader, and Ned
Pugh are there. But does everyone know that Bob
Beckham and Rosamond Upson and J;ick Alltucker and
Jess Hazlett and all the others are there doing the
hard work?
Yes, Cardinals are good workers and really indis
pensable tn Stanford.
