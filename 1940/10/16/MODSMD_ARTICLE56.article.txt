"WHY ENGLAND SLEPT" by John
F. Kennedy: Wilfred Funk, Inc.
On the cover of "Why England I
Slept" is a drawing of a modern
istic lion sleeping as soundly as a
frosh without a Monday eight
o'clock. Another quick look at the
title and a little applied logic will
serve to tie up the two. These days,
however, it would take the most
ill-informed sort of dullard not to
know that England spent a good
portion of the "thirties" in some
sort of a coma.
A number of books have been
written on this and related subjects
—"Guilty Men," "J'Accuse," and
"While England Slept" are only a
few. Most of these consist of vitu
perative accusations hurled at short
sighted leaders; indeed most of the |
comment on the subject has fallen
into this category. "While England
Slept," Winston Churchill's book
written two years ago, was defi
nitely not in the "you, you cach>"
vein. It was an excellent dlspas- I
sionate account of just what the I
British slept through.
TRACES ATTITUDES
Mr. Kennedy's book supplements
Prime Minister Churchill's effort,
and goes farther in that it. explains
why the British delayed their re
armament program until a time that
may prove to have been too late.
Using newspapers, pamphlets, mag
azines, and books, he has traced the
British psychological attitude, as re
flected in his source material, from
1931 down to Munich—after Mu- i
nich the lion is considered wide
awake by most experts.
What he has to say is nothing to
make an American adopt a "holier
than thou" attitude, for there is
little about the English picture that
does not also apply to us. Democ- i
racy, in the matter of armaments, as
he says, "will be two years behind
a dictatorship." For "the one is a j
system geared for peace, the other
for war."
SAME ANALYSIS
It is logical to assume that Mr. ;
Kennedy's method of analysis of the
events is done in the only sane way.
After all, Sunday quarterbacks fill
this world; statements and policies
must be considered in the light of |
the circumstances in which they
were formulated.
"The views expressed in this book
are my own. and for them I accept
full responsibility." This statement
concludes the author's acknowledg
ment. To one certainly less well in
formed than he, his conclusions,
drawn from thoroughly documented
facts, seem intelligent and correct.

into this category. "While England
Slept," Winston Churchill's book

Mr. Kennedy's book supplements
Prime Minister Churchill's effort,
and goes farther in that it. explains
why the British delayed their re
armament program until a time that
may prove to have been too late.
Using newspapers, pamphlets, mag
azines, and books, he has traced the
British psychological attitude, as re
flected in his source material, from
1931 down to Munich—after Mu- i
nich the lion is considered wide
awake by most experts.
What he has to say is nothing to
make an American adopt a "holier
than thou" attitude, for there is
little about the English picture that
does not also apply to us. Democ- i
racy, in the matter of armaments, as
he says, "will be two years behind
a dictatorship." For "the one is a j
system geared for peace, the other
for war."
SAME ANALYSIS
It is logical to assume that Mr. ;
Kennedy's method of analysis of the
events is done in the only sane way.
After all, Sunday quarterbacks fill
this world; statements and policies
must be considered in the light of |
the circumstances in which they
were formulated.
"The views expressed in this book
are my own. and for them I accept
full responsibility." This statement
concludes the author's acknowledg
ment. To one certainly less well in
formed than he, his conclusions,
drawn from thoroughly documented
facts, seem intelligent and correct.

"WHY ENGLAND SLEPT" by John
F. Kennedy: Wilfred Funk, Inc.
On the cover of "Why England I
Slept" is a drawing of a modern
istic lion sleeping as soundly as a
frosh without a Monday eight
o'clock. Another quick look at the
title and a little applied logic will
serve to tie up the two. These days,
however, it would take the most
ill-informed sort of dullard not to
know that England spent a good
portion of the "thirties" in some
sort of a coma.
A number of books have been
written on this and related subjects
—"Guilty Men," "J'Accuse," and
"While England Slept" are only a
few. Most of these consist of vitu
perative accusations hurled at short
sighted leaders; indeed most of the |
comment on the subject has fallen
