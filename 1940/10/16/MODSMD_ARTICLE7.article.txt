### JOHN HORRALL 
"The immediate way the people
of the world can aid in the de
velopment of civilization is to
show the Axis powers that their
type of civilization is not to be
tolerated," explained Sir Hubert
Wilkins last night in his lecture
for the Tuesday Evening Series
entitled "Next Steps toward Civi
lization."
Sir Hubert said that his defini
tion of civilization covers the ad
vancement from barbarism to re
finement; refinement in all of the
finer things. He believes that some
of the countries have reached this
point, but they are now slipping
back.
ESKIMOS STILL SAFE
"To reach this civilization, the
people of the world must have se
curity and co-operation," he re
vealed. "The only people in the
world today with true security are
the Eskimos."
Sir Hubert believes there are two
ways of obtaining security through
out the world: (1) by providing ma
terial things to the citizens, and (2)
by studying meteorology to predict
seasonal weather conditions in re
gard to agriculture.
MATERIAL ADVANTAGES
He declared that by providing
these material things, the people of
the world can use their leisure time
advantageously in getting their
minds off the pressing problems of
everyday life for a short while.
By a knowledge of the coming
weather conditions, economists can
help obtain security by predicting
coming drouths and favorable sea
sons for agriculture.
