HOW'S YOUR BAWL-OUT APPEAL?
Some coaching schools are mere "cramming fac
tories."
The Kingsley Coaching Center, however, has other
objectives. Primarily, we endeavor, through intelligent
and carefully designed instruction, to develop in students
who come to us the attitude and understanding requisite
to normal scholastic progress after the immediate diffi
culties have been remedied.
Sometimes illness occurs; sometimes work suffers
from the press of other duties; sometimes the student
fails to see the course in the proper perspective or to
comprehend "what the instructor wants." In any of
these situations we stand ready to help.
Of course, if you wish to "cram," we will do our
best to help you there, too, but our services are by no
means limited to such assistance.
