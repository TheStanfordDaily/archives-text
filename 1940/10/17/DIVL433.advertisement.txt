know this piece of apparatus as the 108-A
Amplifier. It is an "exploring amplifier,"
developed by Bell System engineers to iden
tify pairs of wires in telephone cables—some
of which contain as many as 4212 wires.
The cable man explores this mass of wires
with the pencil-like probe. Atone sounding
in the headphone tells him when he has
