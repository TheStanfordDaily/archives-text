### BOB LOW 
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT and the
Democratic Party have received
a great deal of legitimate criticism
for the conduct of the nominating
convention in Chicago last July. Es
pecially bitter has been the con
demnation of the President for the
part he played in the selection of
the vice-presidential nominee. Re
gardless of party politics, this phase
of the nominating process of one of
the major party conventions war
rants some attention.
Unquestionably the vast ma
jority of delegates at the Demo
cratic convention wished to see
the President renominated; but it
is equally certain that the ma
jority of delegates would not have
considered Henry A. Wallace for
the vice-presidential nomination
had not the President personally
exerted pressure in his behalf.
Americans as a whole deplored
the method of Wallace's selec
tion.
Senator Charles L. McNary, Wen
dell Willkie's running mate, was
nominated through traditional con
vention procedure, although it is
now known that Willkie privately
preferred McNary ot other candi
dates.
* * *
INURING the campaign, Wallace
has borne the brunt of the cam
paign for the Democratic Party. He
has expressed the ideas of the Presi
dent and the case is clear that he
with the President will defend the
record of the New Deal and if
elected seek to continue its policies.
The voter who wishes to en
dorse the New Deal may do so by
voting for the Roosevelt-Wallace
ticket. The issue on this side is
not obscure.
But the make-up of the Repub
lican slate has detracted some
what from clarifying the issues of
the campaign. A few of the points
on which Willkie and McNary
have disagreed will illustrate a
lack of unity in the Republican
ticket.
Willkie is for all-aid-short-of
v/ar to Great Britain; McNary is an
isolationist who voted against the
repeal of the arms embargo.
Willkie favored the renewal of
Hull's Reciprocal Trade Pacts; Mc-
Nary advocated their abrogation,
holding that they are detrimental to
Western agriculture.
Willkie condemned the utility
holding company bill of 1935 while
McNary voted for the same bill in
the Senate.
Willkie has advocated curtailment
of federal spending; but McNary has
shown that he is a firm believer in
pump-priming, and he helped steer
the 400 million dollar agriculture
bill through the Senate last year.
That Willkie and McNary differ
on many major issues cannot be dis
puted.
* * *
enough the political dif
ferences of the two have been
of advantage to the Republican board
of strategy, for each man has been
given the opportunity to express the
ideas in which he believes in the
particular localities where these
ideas would be the most effective
political ammunition.
The possibility of a vice-presi
dent's taking over the position of
the chief executive cannot be dis
missed, and the voter who favors
Willkie has the expectation that
his running-mate, who may be
come President, will hold the same
policies.
The Republican convention chose
its vice-presidential candidate with
out important dissension; but the
means of selection may no longer be
sufficient cause for some Republic
ans supporting Willkie to be pleased
with his running-mate.
Possibly the "dictatorial" selection
of Wallace has clarified the issue for
some voters; certainly the "demo
cratic" selection of McNary has con
fused the issue for many. Demo
crats have had a difficult time ex
plaining the conduct of their con
ventions; Republicans have had a
difficult time explaining the incon
sistencies of their Presidential and
vice-presidential candidates.

The Republican convention chose
its vice-presidential candidate with
out important dissension; but the
means of selection may no longer be

Possibly the "dictatorial" selection
of Wallace has clarified the issue for
some voters; certainly the "demo
cratic" selection of McNary has con

PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT and the
Democratic Party have received
a great deal of legitimate criticism
for the conduct of the nominating
convention in Chicago last July. Es
pecially bitter has been the con
demnation of the President for the
part he played in the selection of
the vice-presidential nominee. Re
gardless of party politics, this phase
of the nominating process of one of
the major party conventions war
rants some attention.
Unquestionably the vast ma

the President renominated; but it
is equally certain that the ma

had not the President personally
exerted pressure in his behalf.
Americans as a whole deplored
the method of Wallace's selec

INURING the campaign, Wallace
has borne the brunt of the cam
paign for the Democratic Party. He
has expressed the ideas of the Presi
dent and the case is clear that he
with the President will defend the
record of the New Deal and if
elected seek to continue its policies.
The voter who wishes to en
dorse the New Deal may do so by
voting for the Roosevelt-Wallace
ticket. The issue on this side is
not obscure.
But the make-up of the Repub
lican slate has detracted some
what from clarifying the issues of
the campaign. A few of the points
on which Willkie and McNary
have disagreed will illustrate a
lack of unity in the Republican
ticket.
Willkie is for all-aid-short-of
v/ar to Great Britain; McNary is an
isolationist who voted against the
repeal of the arms embargo.
Willkie favored the renewal of
Hull's Reciprocal Trade Pacts; Mc-
Nary advocated their abrogation,
