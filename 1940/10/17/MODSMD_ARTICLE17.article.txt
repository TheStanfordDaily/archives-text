# Draft Musters 16½ Million In U.S. Sign-up
## 900,000 to Be Chosen In First Peacetime Army Service Law 
### 
WASHINGTON, D. C„ Oct. 16
(UP). —The United States Army has
16,500,000 men to choose from, mus
tered Wednesday in the first func
tioning of America's first peacetime
conscription law — the Selective
Service Act.
From them will be picked 900,000
of the best, the cream of the phys
ically fit, the mentally sound and
the socially available, to learn to
shoot a rifle, to drill, to throw a
grenade, to thrust a bayonet, to peel
potatoes, to ride a pitching tank, to
handle a machine gun, to do the
manual of arms.
The muster began at 7 a.m. on
the Atlantic seaboard and rolled
westward with the sun until it was
9 p.m. on the Pacific Coast. In
mountain hamlets, great cities, cold
drizzles, and brilliant, sunshine, men
between the ages of 21 and 36 stood
in line to tell their names, their
ages, and where they may be reached
when the time comes.
TOO LATE NOW
The great roll call went smoothly
enough. There were little hitches
here and there, but they did not se
riously impede the task. It went
calmly, too, without hysteria or up
roar. Where the registrar was a
pretty school teacher there was a
tendency here and there to "wise
crack" when she asked for a tele
phone number.
Little flurries of protest, of con
scientious objection, passed almost
unnoticed in the sea of men moving
in waves up and down the land to
present themselves for selective
service.
CALL TO ALL
Every man of the proper age was
called upon to register—though he
might be a lascar on a freighter
tied up at New York, or lame, or
blind, or deaf and dumb, an alien,
naturalized or native born, rich or
poor, a movie star or a cafeteria bus
boy. The only exceptions were men
in the armed services, or somehow
associated with them, or otherwise
on a stringently limited exempt list.
An hour after the registration be
gan President. Roosevelt went into
the basement of the White House
and told the registrants they were
being called to protect peace and
democracy against those "who have
dared to threaten the whole world
with war."

Little flurries of protest, of con
scientious objection, passed almost
unnoticed in the sea of men moving
in waves up and down the land to
present themselves for selective
service.
CALL TO ALL
Every man of the proper age was
called upon to register—though he
might be a lascar on a freighter
tied up at New York, or lame, or
blind, or deaf and dumb, an alien,
naturalized or native born, rich or
poor, a movie star or a cafeteria bus
boy. The only exceptions were men
in the armed services, or somehow
associated with them, or otherwise
on a stringently limited exempt list.
An hour after the registration be
gan President. Roosevelt went into
the basement of the White House
and told the registrants they were
being called to protect peace and
democracy against those "who have
dared to threaten the whole world
with war."
WASHINGTON, D. C„ Oct. 16
(UP). —The United States Army has
16,500,000 men to choose from, mus
tered Wednesday in the first func
tioning of America's first peacetime
conscription law — the Selective
Service Act.
From them will be picked 900,000
of the best, the cream of the phys
ically fit, the mentally sound and
the socially available, to learn to
shoot a rifle, to drill, to throw a
grenade, to thrust a bayonet, to peel
potatoes, to ride a pitching tank, to
handle a machine gun, to do the
manual of arms.
The muster began at 7 a.m. on
the Atlantic seaboard and rolled
westward with the sun until it was
9 p.m. on the Pacific Coast. In
mountain hamlets, great cities, cold
drizzles, and brilliant, sunshine, men
between the ages of 21 and 36 stood
in line to tell their names, their
ages, and where they may be reached
when the time comes.
TOO LATE NOW
The great roll call went smoothly
enough. There were little hitches
here and there, but they did not se
riously impede the task. It went
calmly, too, without hysteria or up
roar. Where the registrar was a
pretty school teacher there was a
tendency here and there to "wise
crack" when she asked for a tele
phone number.
