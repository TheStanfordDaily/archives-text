# C.A.A. Offers Flight Course
## Qualified Applicants Eligible for Training 
### 
Despite a previous announcement,
Stanford will offer an advanced avia
tion course this quarter as part of
the C.A.A. program, Dr. David L.
Webster, professor of physics and
local C.A.A. co-ordinator, an
nounced yesterday.
The controlled-restricted commer
cial course will be given for credit,
13 units, or without to Stanford
students, as well as others.
Eligible for advanced instruction
are men and women graduates of
the primary C.A.A. training course
who are recommended for advanced
work.
Ten students have already signed
up for the course. Others interested
should apply to Dr. Webster imme
diately. This morning those already
enrolled are to report to the airport
to sign up for insurance. They will
also be notified when to meet for
ground school and flight instruction.
The course includes training in
acrobatics and advanced maneuvers,
as well as ground school instruction.
Aircraft structure, engine mechan
ics, and maintenance will be studied.
Waco planes, heavier than those
used in the primary course, will be
used.
On completion of the course, no
miltary commission will bo given,
but it is likely that the training will
earn the student a ranking allowing
him to fly heavier ships, Dr. Webster
stated. But no commercial certificate
is offered, he added.
The course will be completed
about the middle of January.
