A battle-scarred old gentleman, wearing a VFW pin and a vicious
cleave in his forehead, indelible memento of World War I. looked up
from his seat at the draft registration table and. with pen poised, said:
''(live mc your lull name, son."

defend the nation, yesterday.
The registration boards proved for
another time that it takes all kinds.
From the enthusiastic supporter to
the conscientious objector, 1074 Stan
ford men turned up to register for
one year's military training under
the Selective Service and Training
Act.
ENTHUSIASTIC TURNOUT
Yes, there was the enthusiastic
type. One fellow, under 21, begged
registrars working under Dewey
Goodspeed in the Education Build
ing lobby to fake his age. They had
to turn him down, told him to "go
join the Marines." You can always
volunteer.
Yes, there was the conscientious
objector. Registrars under Dr.
Thomas A. Bailey signed up a reg
istrant who insisted upon writing
"conscientious objector" on his reg
istration card. This was his privi
lege, and he does not have to serve
in combatant, service.
EVERYBODY THERE
But, whether they wanted to or
not, they turned up. The lame, the
halt, and the blind turned up. The
law carries a penalty of five years
imprisonment and $10,000 fine for
evasion.
There were bull sessions all over
the place. Whenever there was a
slump in the day's business, some
one started in with, "I remember
the time ..."
OTHERS BEMOAN FATE
Others, just over 21, were heard
to wail, "This is the first time in my
life I ever wished I was younger
than I am."
Dr. Karl M. Cowdery, in charge
of registration, reports no grumbles,
but, states some were skeptical about
where they might be detailed to
serve.
Stanford men, among the 16,500,-
000 men registered throughout the
country, will now wait for their
number to be called. Next step is
to shuffle the registration cards and
give them numbers, from No. 1 to
No. 16,500.000. Then, some time be
tween Oct. 26 and Nov. 2, a gianl.
lottery will be held in Washington
and those whose numbers are
called will fill out questionnaires to
determine their classification.
The peacetime call will go out to
those available and fit for military
service. The cream of the crop,
900,000 men, will get the call.
