# Fighter Undergoes Operation on Eyes
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 16 (UP). â€”
Heniy Armstrong, former holder of
three boxing championships, yester
day underwent an operation to re
move scar tissue from his left eye.
The operation removed an inch of
superfluous skin over the left eye
and a similar operation will be per
formed over Armstrong's right eye
later this week or early next week.
America's participation in the
World War brought about the re
establishment of military training
in the University, made compulsory
in 1917 and merged into the Stu
dent Army Training Corps in 1918.
