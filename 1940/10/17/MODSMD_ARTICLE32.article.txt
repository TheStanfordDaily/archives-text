# Hanker Speaks To Lunch Club On Guide Dogs
## 'Seeing Eye," Owner Require No Favors, Says Blind Engineer 
### 
One of the most interesting talks
of the year on Luncheon Club's
schedule was delivered yesterday
by Frederick C. Hanker, blind lec
turer in the electricity department,
before a large audience when he
spoke at 12:30 in the Nitery on the
use of "seeing eye" dogs for the
blind.
Explaining Seeing Eye, Inc., of
Morristown, N.J., the institution that
trains the dogs, Mr. Hanker told
how the dogs are first trained with a
trainer for two to three months and
then with the owner for a period of
four to ten weeks, depending upon
the adaptability of the owner and
dog.
Referring to the "etiquette" of
passers-by when they meet a dog
guide and his master, the speaker
said, "The guide dog and his mas
ter require no special favors. The
dogs are taught to keep to the right
of the sidewalk and will invariably
do so if possible."
DOG HISTORY
Telling something of the history
of guide dogs in this country, Mr.
Hanker said that after rather wide
experimentation with the dogs in
Switzerland following the Work!
War, Morris Frank of Nashville,
Tenn., originated Seeing Eye, Inc.,
in 1929, the institution being en
dowed by Mrs. Harrison Eustis. Its
headquarters in Morristown are now
being enlarged to train 180 dogs a
year.
The charge for a guide dog is
very reasonable, no down payment
whatever is required, and payments
! are made as liberal for the pur
| chaser as possible, since the organi
zation prefers all purchasers to pay
for the dogs themselves without ac
cepting charity.
NEVER QUESTION
"The training of the dog teaches
him to stop whenever an obstruc
tion is encountered on the sidewalk
or street. The master never ques
tions the dog in such cases, for he
will either turn to the right or left
or find a way around the obstruc
tion.

dogs are taught to keep to the right
of the sidewalk and will invariably
do so if possible."
DOG HISTORY
Telling something of the history
of guide dogs in this country, Mr.
Hanker said that after rather wide
experimentation with the dogs in
Switzerland following the Work!
War, Morris Frank of Nashville,
Tenn., originated Seeing Eye, Inc.,
in 1929, the institution being en
dowed by Mrs. Harrison Eustis. Its
headquarters in Morristown are now
being enlarged to train 180 dogs a
year.
The charge for a guide dog is
very reasonable, no down payment
whatever is required, and payments
! are made as liberal for the pur
| chaser as possible, since the organi
zation prefers all purchasers to pay
for the dogs themselves without ac
cepting charity.
NEVER QUESTION
"The training of the dog teaches
him to stop whenever an obstruc
tion is encountered on the sidewalk
or street. The master never ques
tions the dog in such cases, for he
will either turn to the right or left
or find a way around the obstruc
tion.
