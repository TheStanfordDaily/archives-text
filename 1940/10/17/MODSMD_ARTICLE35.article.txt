## 
### 
With plans to meet Arizona and
Utah still in the formative stage,
Major F. A. Garrecht is hoping to
produce a horse polo team from a 1
group that has quantity but an un
known amount of quality.
There are approximately 50-odd
men from which the major will have
to draw his final team. If plans go
through, Stanford will play Arizona
during Thanksgiving, and also meet
Utah in the fall.

Director Strickland announces that
there are still six parts open for
male singers in the chorus of the
coining musical production, "Of Thee
I Sing." Anyone interested may
call to the theater for appointments,
or come to rehearsals this Friday in
the choir room or Monday or Tues
