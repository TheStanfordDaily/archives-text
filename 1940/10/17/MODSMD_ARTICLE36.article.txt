# McCain, Mannon Bolster Indian Tackle Positions; Jeffrey Won't Go North
## 
### 
In an effort to bolster his reserve tackles, Coach Clark Shaughnessy yes
terday concentrated oh a couple of husky, converted sophomores. Alter
nating with the first string as it ran through its offense in preparation for
Saturday's game with Washington State were Bill .Mannon and Ed McCain
at the tackle spots.
Mannon was Frosh Coach Harry Shipkev's top center and McCain was

first-stringer Dick Palmer's
mate at guard on last year's highly |
successful frosh eleven. These two j
have the physical requirements of j
size and speed to help the reserve ;
tackles, Ed Stamm and Claude
Purkitt, fill in for the now seasoned
Bruno Banducci and Rod Warnecke.
JEFFREY SPRAINS FOOT
One name was prominently miss
ing from Shaughnessy's list of 37
who will make the trek north into
the region of the Cougar. It was i
Clyde "Jiffy" Jeffrey who will be I
unable to make the trip because of |
a sprained foot. So used to running |
on his toes as a sprinter, Jeff was
bothered by the football cleats in
the heels ol his shoos and wrenched
his foot during a recent practice. But
with a new shoe which is cut low !
in the back, Jeff will be able to use j
his natural speed to better advan
tage in the future.
Mr. Shaughnessy has done an
other little bit of shifting around.
With the return of Thor Peterson,
whom the coaching staff thought
would make a better quarterback
than fullback despite his experience
at this latter position, the Cards had
a multitude of quarters.
CRANE AT FULL
So Bob "Crunch" Crane has been
moved from the key position just
behind the center ot make room for
Peterson and. is now running at
fullback.
Three members of the Indian
coaching staff will be handling scout
ing assignments Saturday afternoon
and the Stanford coaching staff will
look as streamlined as the team's
offense up in Pullman when Indian
meets Cougar.
End Coach Jim Lawson will head
south this week-end to scout those
Terrible Trojans who have man
aged to scare only one of their
three opponents this year. Phil
Bengtson, line coach, will take the
short trip up to Berkeley to watch
the battle of cousins when California
meets U.C.L.A.
Meanwhile, Marchie Schwartz,
backfield coach, will go as far north
as Seattle with the team but will
stop off there to see what promises
to be a close fought and highly in- j
formative tilt between Washington
and Oregon State, the Cards' most
highly touted rivals.
INDIANS FAVORED
On paper Stanford has a definite
advantage over the Cougars with
three victories and no defeats over j
tougher teams. But Washington i
State is undefeated, too, having j
been tied by the "lucky" Trojans of
U.S.C., and having beaten Montana
21-0 and California 9-6.
And the Cougars have played
their toughest and best games away
from their home field. The psychol
ogy of playing a muchly feared team
such as Stanford on their home field
before a huge crowd and during
"home-coming" week gives the
northerners a decided mental ad
vantage.
The Indians on the other hand
have had, for some, reason or an
other, to build themselves to a high
mental pitch for each of their first
three games. Against U.S.F. they
had to make good, for they and the
Shaughnessy system were making
their 1940 debut. Against Oregon
they had to go at full speed to prove
their worth in conference competi
tion, and Santa Clara was, well,
Santa Clara.
::: Indians go north
It's going to be awful tough for
the Cards to maintain their present
high speed and to find a good reason
for hitting the Cougars on all eleven
cylinders. And in this tough Coast
Conference competition a team can
never let up if it is really Rose Bowl
bound.
The 37 Indians who have been
chosen by Shaughnessy to make the
trip north are Frankie Albert, Eric
Armstrong, Bruno Banducci, John
Casey, A1 Cole. Bob Crane. Bob Dit
levsen, Jack Francis, Hugh Gallar
neau, Stan Graffi, Ray Hammett,
John Kerman, Pete Kmetovic, Vic
Lindskog, and Ed McCain.
Colin McClintock, Bill Mannon,
Arnold Meiners, Fred Meyer. Hank
Norberg, Chick Orme, Dick Palmer,
Rod Parker, Claude Purkitt, Ken
Robesky, Bud Radditz, Glenn South.
Doug Stable, Norm Standlee. Ed
Stamm, Chuck Taylor. Jake Thomp
son. Clem Tommerln, Milt Vucinich.
Jack Warnecke ,Bi 11 Willard, and
Thor Peterson.
