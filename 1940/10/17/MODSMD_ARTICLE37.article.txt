# Farm Paddlers Down San Jose In Close Battle
## 
### 
Stanford's fast-improving var
sity water polo team made it two
in a row over the San Jose pad
dlers, yesterday in the Encina
pools, by turning back the visi
tors 5 to 4. The first game, played
here two weeks ago during the
Junior Pacific Association Cham
pionships, saw Stanford win 8
to 4.
Led by Frank Mitchell, newly dis
covered offensive spark, the Cards
distributed their goals evenly in all
four periods, and pulled away in the
third quarter to win handily. The
hard-working San Jose aggregation
threatened several times but were
unable to break through the de
fense work of Captain Ted Moreno,
Mitchell, and the goalies. Smith and
Breckner.
The Cards were only in real dan
ger once when, at the beginning of
the third period, the Stanford of
fense bogged down momentarily to
let San Jose even things up at four
all.
INDIANS IMPROVED
Coach Thornton's fast - breaking
forward wall, composed of Nottage,
Tietjen, and Weeden, assisted by
Mitchell, kept the ball in enemy
territory most of the time. The In
dians showed great ball handling
improvement in this, their last prac
tice game before actual conference
competition begins.
Nottage led the scoring with two
points.
A hectic preliminary battle saw
the Stanford frosh eke out a 6 to 5
win over the San Jose freshmen.
The game was a close-fought battle
all the way with Stanford winning
in an over-time period.
