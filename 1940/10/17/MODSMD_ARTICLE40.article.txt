Farm will gather down at the [
! Paly station this afternoon to j
send the Indian gridders off on their
northwest passage, their "Cool the
Cougar" crusade.
Three weeks ago anyone saying
that the Shaughnessymen would
leave for their first road trip ranked
tenth in the country by a nation
wide poll of football experts would
have been kept under very close
observation.
Today Coast pigskin circles re
alize that this cardinal-jerseyed
eleven is a definite threat for any
and all honors to be handed out
when the season ends.
So it is probable that one of the
| largest gatherings in years will be
' present this afternoon to wish this
| team and its coach good luck up at
| Pullman, and to exhort them to bring
| home another victory.

TAYTON FRYE, Farm mitt coach,
I has broken into print as author
of a 60-page booklet entitled "Prac
j tical. Boxing."
The book, filled with illustrative
drawings, is a complete course in
the rudiments of the science of
self defense .It explains thorough
ly the important leads, feints, and
counters, as well as offering in
formation on ring generalship, sec
onding. etc.
Explaining the main purpose of
| his book, Coach Frye says in the
preface:
' The Lesson Plan as outlined in
J this book shows the fundamental
techniques necessary for the devel
opment of competitive teams and
j enough additional material to make
boxing interesting and enjoyable to
! phvsical-education classes."

I JT'S getting so a guy gets a jolt
| about every third morning when
[ he looks at the Intramural results.
Last week it was "Firehouse 56,
Japanese Club 0."
Yesterday it was "Firehouse 41.
Phi Delts 6."
That's disgusting. Of course,
i there's consolation in the fact that
J the Firemen fell off a little in the
I second game, but maybe they were
up against slightly tougher opposi
tion.
Considering the fact that those in
tramural touch games only run 40
j minutes, the losing teams must
have had a lot of fun.
In the manner of Prescott Sulli
; van, we might, venture out on a limb
1 and say that it. looks almost as
j though, if they were very lucky, ihe
Firehouse boys might come very
close to winning the championship.
A secret operative informs me
that the Firehouse gridders prac
ticed most of the summer.
Maybe there should be a law mak
ing it mandatory for teams to have
only 30 days of spring practice and
two weeks of practice before the
j season starts.

But I don't think that would do
much good. It looks to me as though [
the Firehouse just has a very potent j
ball club, perhaps some day they
won't be quite so good and the rest
of the intramural football teams can
have a crack at the championship.
