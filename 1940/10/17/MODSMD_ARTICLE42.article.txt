## 
### 
Today is the final day for en

and horseshoe tournaments. As
pirants can sign up on the intra
mural bulletin board in Encina
Gym.
At a meeting last night of all in
tramural managers, Elton Boone,
Phi Psi, Kai Larson, A.T.0., and
Sherrn Selix, Breakers, were elected
to the intramural staff to represent
all of the organizations in their
meetings. Plans were discussed with
Varsity Track Coach Pitch Johnson
for an Irish Relay to be held Satur
day morning either Nov. 9 or 16.
Each team will be limited to 16
men, who will run a four-mile
course all over the campus.
Roy Terry proposed a plan to form
a Stanford Bowling League, but a
damper was put on this when it was
learned that it could not be an offi
cial intramural activity.
There were no contests scheduled
for yesterday because of the draft
registration.
