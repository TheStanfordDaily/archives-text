## 
### 
Although Modesto Junior College
has a record of onl> one victory in
the three games they played
this season, Fred Earle, Pirate men
tor. will lield a much improved
team against the Stanford Frosh
this Saturday. Indian Frosh Coach
Harry Shipkey expects Modesto to
he the toughest competition his
charges have met yet this year.
In their last contest, wfciich they
dropped to San Jose State Frosh.
the Pirates were without the serv
ices of Chuck Coker. their star
passer and kicker, and Charles Lab
no, a flashy guard. However, both
of these boys are expected to play
Saturday, and should make a dif- |
ferenee in the effectiveness of the j
J.C. eleven.
Star lineman of the Pirates so far
has been Jack Galvin of Redwood j
City, while Leo Peccianti, Howard
Nelson, Lauren Dauben, Ed Martin,
and Russel Goodnight also hold up
| theii share of the work in the front
' line.
A boy whom the Papoose eleven
I will have to keep their eyes on is
i Harold "Andy" Anderson, who does
j most of the ball carrying for Mo
' desto. He scored the lone touch
j down in Modesto's 6-0 win over
j San Francisco State Frosh.
j In preparation for the Pirates,
; Coach Harry Shipkey sent his
j Papoose gridders through a fast
pass scrum yesterday afternoon after
a session of offensive drill. If the
amount of passing the frosh have
done in games thus far and the
practice sessions they've given to
I their aerial game are any criteria,
Saturday will see the yearlings toss
ing the ball all over the lot.
