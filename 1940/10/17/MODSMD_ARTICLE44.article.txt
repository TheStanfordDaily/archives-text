LOS ANGELES. Oct. 16 (UP).â€”
The U.S.C. Trojans went through
the week's toughest workout today
as Coach Howard Jones attempted
to teach his team a new aerial at
tack for use against the University
of Oregon Saturday.
Mickey Anderson, Trojan quar
terback who has been on the bench
with an injured knee, was back in
uniform and the doctor said he
might possibly carry the ball against
Oregon. Meanwhile on the other
side of town, Coach Babe Horrell
picked a 43-man squad to represent
U.C.L.A. against the University of
California at Berkeley Saturday,
the Bruins were all in top condition
as they went through final home
practice and smoothed out their
aerial attack.
