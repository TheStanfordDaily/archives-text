# R-Day Debris
## 
### 
YESTERDAY, as nearly everyone is aware,
was R-Day. Today, in the company of about
1,700 other Stanford men, this writer is carrying
a small white card that proclaims he has a ruddy
complexion and an intention of serving one year
in the armed forces of the nation.
The passage of the Selective Service Act may
have been somewhat of a blow to many college
men. When spring quarter ended with its tra
ditionally sad Senior Week and Dr. Wilbur sent
out a new collection of graduates to face a world
that seemed troubled and far from secure, no
undergraduate would have predicted that, in
four months, he would be signing a card that
placed him in a vast new civilian army.
Less than a month after most of us filled out
University registration booklets, we again
signed our names—but to a very different ques
tionnaire. For so many undergraduates that sig
nature may write "finis" to college and its cheer
ful, constructive, and sometimes pointless pleas
ures.
As Congress sweltered through its long sum
mer session and you and I jumped for the morn
ing papers to see not the sports page but the
screaming black headlines, few of us believed
that we might be Drafted, Drafted for service in
time of peace.
Yesterday we were. We thought perhaps
Congress might try other means of voluntary
enlistment first—raising salaries and lowering
enlistment periods. We thought maybe some
tactician could explain adequately just why the
nation needed four million trained men when
Europe's war showed the efficiency of a few
highly-skilled troops and a strongly mechan
ized, mobile army.
We thought maybe, too, someone could tell
us just how much better it would be to spend
this money for partially training a large group
of men instead of concentrating on building a
two-ocean navy and an invulnerable air force.
We believed that there must be some kind
of information about training grounds—where
the men would be quartered, what equipment
would be used to train them, where we could
get the thousands of rifles and dozens of tanks,
machine guns, anti-aircraft battalions to accom
plish the education process. No one seemed to
know.
We questioned, too, what might happen to
draftees when they were released from their
term of enlistment. Where will their jobs be?
What can they do to insure themselves, eco
nomically, from the dangers of unemployment?
We wondered why, after Congress had
passed the Burke-Wadsworth bill, it had to fight
all over again to slip through some kind of
measure to draft wealth as well as man-power
in time of crisis. And that fight was harder,
more difficult to accomplish. You and I aren't
really profiteering on $21 a month; we won
dered why anyone else should demand almost
"cost plus profits" at such a time, or why a cer
tain aircraft factory held up production until
it received substantial guarantees. This didn't
make much sense.
No one answered these questions.
But yesterday America registered. What the
nation registered for—peace or war—no man
can say. Perhaps it started again down the road
to conflict, a road grown much shorter since
September, 1939. No other nation that has ever
re-armed as swiftly and completely as America
has been able to avoid war. Perhaps America
wants war. At least America will re-arm—me
chanically, morally—to face an unknown des-
Mny.
Whether or not that destiny will juggle the
-as of history to the good or bad side, no one

that we might be Drafted, Drafted for service in
time of peace.
Yesterday we were. We thought perhaps
Congress might try other means of voluntary
enlistment first—raising salaries and lowering
enlistment periods. We thought maybe some
tactician could explain adequately just why the
nation needed four million trained men when
Europe's war showed the efficiency of a few
highly-skilled troops and a strongly mechan
ized, mobile army.
We thought maybe, too, someone could tell
us just how much better it would be to spend
this money for partially training a large group
of men instead of concentrating on building a
two-ocean navy and an invulnerable air force.
We believed that there must be some kind
of information about training grounds—where
the men would be quartered, what equipment
would be used to train them, where we could
get the thousands of rifles and dozens of tanks,
machine guns, anti-aircraft battalions to accom
plish the education process. No one seemed to
know.
We questioned, too, what might happen to
draftees when they were released from their
term of enlistment. Where will their jobs be?
What can they do to insure themselves, eco
nomically, from the dangers of unemployment?
We wondered why, after Congress had
passed the Burke-Wadsworth bill, it had to fight
all over again to slip through some kind of
measure to draft wealth as well as man-power
in time of crisis. And that fight was harder,
more difficult to accomplish. You and I aren't
really profiteering on $21 a month; we won
dered why anyone else should demand almost
"cost plus profits" at such a time, or why a cer
tain aircraft factory held up production until
it received substantial guarantees. This didn't
make much sense.
No one answered these questions.
But yesterday America registered. What the
nation registered for—peace or war—no man
can say. Perhaps it started again down the road
to conflict, a road grown much shorter since
September, 1939. No other nation that has ever
re-armed as swiftly and completely as America
has been able to avoid war. Perhaps America
wants war. At least America will re-arm—me
chanically, morally—to face an unknown des-
Mny.
Whether or not that destiny will juggle the
-as of history to the good or bad side, no one
YESTERDAY, as nearly everyone is aware,
was R-Day. Today, in the company of about
1,700 other Stanford men, this writer is carrying
a small white card that proclaims he has a ruddy
complexion and an intention of serving one year
in the armed forces of the nation.
The passage of the Selective Service Act may
have been somewhat of a blow to many college
men. When spring quarter ended with its tra
ditionally sad Senior Week and Dr. Wilbur sent
out a new collection of graduates to face a world
that seemed troubled and far from secure, no
undergraduate would have predicted that, in
four months, he would be signing a card that
placed him in a vast new civilian army.
Less than a month after most of us filled out
University registration booklets, we again
signed our names—but to a very different ques
tionnaire. For so many undergraduates that sig
nature may write "finis" to college and its cheer
ful, constructive, and sometimes pointless pleas
ures.
As Congress sweltered through its long sum
mer session and you and I jumped for the morn
ing papers to see not the sports page but the
screaming black headlines, few of us believed
that we might be Drafted, Drafted for service in
time of peace.
