YES. NO. YES! NO!—AW, MAYBE
the front pages of this issue you have prob
ably read enough about the draft and draft regis
tration to stuff your intellectual gullet from now until
the time your children register.
So today, for the first time in many a week, let's
not make any mention of the nasty ol' draft. The
secondary, pressing problem of the day seems to be
the perennial "good-or-bad?" question of the pros
and the cons of Cardinals.
This problem is nothing new. You probably talked
it over last year and the year before that, depending
of course on how long you have been here. Last Tues
day's punch at Cardinals by the Excom was the first
definite and constructive action to materialize in many
a moon.
On the con side of this action, you immediately
come face to face with the question of "Who'll take
care of the caretaker's daughter while the caretaker's
taking pare?" In short, who is to watch the committee
who watches the committee. After all, if you, or
rather Excom, begin to toy around with the present
system of selection, you are apt to run into the same
situation —only on a larger scale.
Excom is also composed of students, and since only
God was created perfect—well ,who knows? And you
know where to address Campus Opinion letters.
There is a nasty rumor, you know, that Stanford
works under an Honor System. That reaches down
into Cardinals' appointments. And, besides, they al
ways do their jobs, and well, too.

i iN the pro side of the Excom action, it must be ad
mitted that their action was justified. You can't
put your finger on anything, you can't render a dog
matic, unqualified yes or no, but there appears to be
some sort of a need for a reorganization of the appoint
ment system.
Cardinals is—as you have probably gathered from
the newspapers—a self selective body. That is, this
year's members will select their immediate successors.
Which leaves several rather juicy loopholes.
Now, this is not supposed to suggest anything. But
you can't side-step the fact that certain campus living
groups have, year after year, at least one member on
Cardinals.
Of course, of course, of course, Cardinals, those
were the only people who came out. Nobody else
probably wanted to be on Cardinals.
Why then did about 150 students try out for Rally
Committee this fall? Surely Rally Committee isn't
that much better than Cardinals.

one of the Cardinals' sins—no pun intended
—is their lack of advertising. The Rally Com
mittee is required by the student constitution—head
man Bill Kimball tells us—to give at least three days
of tryouts and at least three days of pre-tryout adver
ising. There is no such stipulation in the constitution
covering Cardinals.
A little more Cardinal advertising would probably
bring out a larger turnout of interested tryoutees. The
resulting keener competition would probably result in
making it a little more difficult to "cram" the brothers
and sisters into "the organization"—if such is the
present practice.
In addition, since Excom has pointed the way,
some sort of an advisory board containing, let's say,
one or two Excom members would possibly facilitate
and impartialize the entire selective process. Their
addition could do no harm.
Yes, no, yes, no, maybe. Well, your guess is as
good as the next.
