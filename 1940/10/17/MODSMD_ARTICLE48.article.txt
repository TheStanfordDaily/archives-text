# CAMPUS OPINION
## DRAFT AND AGE 
### 
EDITOR, SIR:
It is of more than ordinary interest to note the
distribution of the votes for and against the draft.
Our freshmen and sophomores rise to the call of
duty with a commendable alacrity, knowing that they
will not be called for some time.
Would that we juniors and seniors were as noble
and patriotic as these, that we were as willing to
sacrfice our lives as these are to sacrifice them for us.
Although I can but admit that this statement is un
supported by figures, it seems to me that the vast
majority of the lower division students are under the
first age limit.
There are a great number of statements in the Bible
which I have not been able to reconcile with my
everyday experience, but it has been one of my firm
beliefs that the Commandment, "Thou shalt not kill,"
is reasonable beyond any shadow of doubt.
Conscription can have but one result, no matter
how we try to deceive ourselves; we, like our fathers
and our grandfathers, shall shoulder our guns and go
forth to fight. The brave ones will be those who, in
spite of the popular opinion against them, will continue
to serve peace rather than war. Thousands of others
will don uniforms and drill, not because they believe
conscription is right, but because they are more afraid
of the sneers of old friends than of the bullets of new
enemies.
This is merely a thin cry against the torrent of
shouting which is swiftly drawing us into war. I shall
march, too, not because I am brave but because I fear
the white feather.
I suspect that this letter will raise several varieties
of hell. If anyone can prove to me that I am wrong,
he will be doing my conscience a great favor; other
wise, I shall feel rather guilty when I first pull the
trigger against a man I do not know.
Respectfully yours,
'41
