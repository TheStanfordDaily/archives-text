r EDITOR. SIR:
May I add my voice to yours, in awakening the
dying fires of democracy at Stanford? I am referring
to your recent editorials upon that self-perpetuating
ruler of committee appointments. Cardinals. The indi
vidual members of Cardinals are well-suited for their
jobs—at least, we may perhaps assume as much.
However, I do not wish to consider the members
of Cardinals, but the body itself, as a menace to good
student government at Stanford. "Gravy boats" are
not intolerable, if they only are found in small, unim
portant committees or enterprises. But when the
highest appointed body in our A.S.S.U. structure has
—and deserves—the name of "gravy boat," a change
appears advisable. This change, it is my belief, should
come from either Cardinals itself, since its members
must recognize its defects—or it should be initiated
by Ex Committee.
Appointment of Cardinals members by Ex Commit
tee would not be very ideal, but it would be a better
plan than that now used—self-perpetuation.
Every Daily editor seems to have some pet "gripe"
or reform which he tries to put over to the student
body. Why not make this subject yours. Mr. Editor?
I am sure that you will find adequate support if you
urge a change in Cardinals strongly enough.
For obvious reasons, I should rather not have my
name printed below, having already gone through the
Rally Committee-Cardinals "gravy train." I might be
accused of hypocrisy.
