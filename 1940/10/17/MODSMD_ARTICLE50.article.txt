# 'Howards' Portray Early U.S. Strife Patriotism
## 
### 
"THE HOWARDS OF VIRGINIA," with Cary Grant, Martha Scott,
Alan Marshal, Sir Cedric Hardwickc, Richard Carlson and Paul Kelly.
Now playing at the Fox Stanford Theater.
The Hollywood answer to the loss of the foreign market is patriotism
and more patriotism. "The Howards of Virginia" should he seen, if only

for patriotic reasons. Aside from'
that, the picture has several scenes
that are excellent, because of the
performances of such stars as Mar
tha Scott, Sir Cedric Hardwicke,
and Paul Kelly.
Although a more serious actor may
have been a wiser choice for the
role of Matt Howard, Cary Grant
turns in a most convincing portrayal
after the first shock of seeing him
without his customary collar and
tie.
The picture is an adaptation of
"The Tree of Liberty" by Elizabeth
Page, a book of considerable length.
SO THE STORY GOES
The story begins in pre-revolu
tionary times when Americans were
just learning about* liberty and free
dom. Matt Howard is the son of a
backwoods family who is educated
by the owner of a large estate. His
friendship with the landlord's son
enables him to survey a snobbish
wealthy landowner's estate. Here he
meets Preyton's sister. Matt's charm
overcomes the class boundaries
which Jane Preyton holds, and they
marry.
MORE HOWARDS
Later both Howard and his two
sons enlist in the army and meet at
camp in Valley Forge. In the final
encounter of the war the crippled
son distinguishes himself and wins
the admiration of his father.
Of such stuff epics are made, and
this picture comes near to that goal.
"The Howards of Virginia" is defi
nitely worthwhile.â€”Mull
