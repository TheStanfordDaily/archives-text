"Ladeccz and gcnnulmcn. ... presenting the gala opening of the Stan
ford 1940-41 drama festival with a three-night run of the famous melo
drama hv Dion Boucicault. 'The Poor of New York,' done in the manner
of its first performance in 1857 at Wallack's Theater in New York."
The play, which opens at Memorial Theater tonight at 8:15 o'clock, is

reported to have been acclaimed
its premiere with shouts of appro
bation and its actors with repeated
cheers and bravos.
"Goodness Ever Conquers Gold" as
the subtitle of the production shows
it to be a robust example of the
exciting "mellerdrammer" which our
grandfathers enjoyed. This marks a
fitting beginning to a theater season
designed to show the progress of the
theater durning the last 50 years, in
honor of Stanford's golden jubilee.
The plot of "The Poor of New
York" runs the gamut of emotions
from -sorrow to joy, from tragedy to
comedy. The heroine cries a dra
matic "Never!" when the villainess
asks her to give up the hero. The
villain snarls, "Curses, foiled again,"
when thwarted. The old homestead
is mortgaged, the hero braves flame
and smoke to rescue the important
papers. Truly an exciting produc
tion.
