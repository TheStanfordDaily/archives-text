The "Middle-Weight"
Jav k c t Ch amp I 0 n
Wholly new idea in indoor-outdoor coats. Originated
by Manhattan, and selected in a poll by upper class
men: "We like it, weight, colors, saddle stitching and
all." Wool suede, $8.95. At your favorite store, along
with those other Manhattan hits, the wool-and-rayon
gabardine shirt ($5), and the plaid cotton flannel high
tone Hillbilly shirt (s2).
