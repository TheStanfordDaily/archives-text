{OCTOBER 17—the day that Japa
nese newspapers predicted
"World War II" would get under
way—passed yesterday without any
indication from Tokyo that a dec
laration of war was imminent. The
Burma Road, whose reopening the
Japanese said would precipitate war
with Britain, was reported yesterday
definitely open to traffic.
Equally encouraging news for
China's millions who as yet have
not been absorbed by the Japanese
push into their country was the dis
closure in Washington yesterday
that the United States is negotiating
to provide China with increased
financial aid.
Several weeks ago the Import -
Export Bank announced the ex
tension of a 25 million dollar loan
to China. During the past seven
years the United States has loaned
China approximately 85 million
dollars, of which almost !i5 million
dollars has been repaid.
To Americans accustomed to read
ing of billion-dollar appropriations,
U. S. aid to China may seem incon
sequential, but to the Chinese
American loans have been a god
send.

jDISPATCH from Lashio, Burma,
last night contained an eye
witness picture of the reopening of
the road and what it meant to Chi
nese coolies present on the scene.
According to the correspondent of
the United Press, thousands "burst
into cheers as the great highway re
sumed operations and cheered again
when Chinese officials announced
that four American ships with cargo
lor the highway had reached Ran
goon during the week."
But the Japanese promised to end
abruptly any Chinese elation over
the road's reopening with furious
aerial bombarding of the entire
route. Yet some Chinese may find
occasion to smile — a considerable
quantity of Japanese goods bearing
Chinese labels were found in the
first shipment yesterday!

as to the extent of
k Nazi penetration in the Balkans
continues in every quarter, and ru
mors from Ankara and Moscow have
l>een regarded most intently. Tur
key controls the Dardanelles and the
Bosporus, which have been re
garded as possible Nazi objectives.
Russia may not permit the en
trance to the Black Sea to fall into
the hands of a powerful nation—and
in this case a powerful ally. Turkish
officials yesterday claimed Russia
had promised aid in the event of a
Nazi attack on any portion of Turk
ish territory, which includes both
European and Asiatic banks of the
straits leading into the Black Sea.
But London sources declared all
hope of Russian intervention to
keep the Germans from gaining
control over the strategic water
way connecting the Mediterranean
and the Black Seas had disap
peared. The British are vitally in
terested in the preservation of a
free Turkey for Turkey might be
made a Nazi highway to oil fields
in the Near East. Hopes for a
Berlin -to - Bagdad thoroughfare
have not been dead in Nazi circles.
* aft *

THEIR occupation of Rumania,
Germany has already acquired
outlets on'the Black Sea and rumors
persist that Nazi submarine bases
are under construction in several
Rumanian ports.
Moscow has not discussed Ger
many's newest drive to the East, al
though some significance has been
placed on one allusion to the occu
pation of Rumania. While Berlin
announced that all interested,
friendly powers were notified be
forehand of the invasion, Moscow
denied receipt of any such state
ment.
Only persons acquainted with
Russia's internal strength—morale
and armed forces — can predict
whether the Soviet can risk war in
order to colalborate with Turkey in
the defense of the straits. Perhaps
only Hitler knows whether Ger
many will risk a war with Russia in
order to make a grab for the Near
Eastern oil fields.

THEIR occupation of Rumania,
Germany has already acquired
outlets on'the Black Sea and rumors
persist that Nazi submarine bases
are under construction in several
Rumanian ports.
Moscow has not discussed Ger
many's newest drive to the East, al
though some significance has been
placed on one allusion to the occu
pation of Rumania. While Berlin
announced that all interested,
friendly powers were notified be
forehand of the invasion, Moscow
denied receipt of any such state
ment.
Only persons acquainted with
Russia's internal strength—morale
and armed forces — can predict
whether the Soviet can risk war in
order to colalborate with Turkey in
the defense of the straits. Perhaps
only Hitler knows whether Ger
many will risk a war with Russia in
order to make a grab for the Near
Eastern oil fields.
{OCTOBER 17—the day that Japa

"World War II" would get under
way—passed yesterday without any
indication from Tokyo that a dec
laration of war was imminent. The
Burma Road, whose reopening the
Japanese said would precipitate war
with Britain, was reported yesterday
definitely open to traffic.
Equally encouraging news for
China's millions who as yet have
not been absorbed by the Japanese
push into their country was the dis
closure in Washington yesterday
that the United States is negotiating
to provide China with increased
financial aid.
Several weeks ago the Import -
Export Bank announced the ex
tension of a 25 million dollar loan
to China. During the past seven
years the United States has loaned
China approximately 85 million
dollars, of which almost !i5 million
dollars has been repaid.
To Americans accustomed to read

U. S. aid to China may seem incon
