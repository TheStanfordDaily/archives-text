# Players Romp Through 1857 Melodrama
## 
### VIC MINAHAN 
Amid the hisses and "shouts of
approbation" of a small but appre
ciative Memorial Theater audience,
the Stanford Players last night
poked fun at the theater of yester
day with a rollicking performance
of what was once the toast of the
New York stage—Dion Boucicault's
"The Poor of New York."
With Valentino - like gestures,
rending sobs and a musical back
ground of "Hearts and Flowers,"
!he Players proved beyond a doubt
that Poverty is Noble and Goodness
Ever Conquers Gold. Besides that,
the Players proved again that they
are as talented and versatile a group
of actors as can be found on an
American campus.
Moreover, there was a respon
siveness and genuine feeling of en
joyment in last night's audience
that had not been present since last
year's comedy success, "The War
rior's Husband." The hilarious over
acting, the touched-up lines, and
the between-acts cutting up got
more laughs from the audience than
any of the regular comedies so far
attempted.
DIFFICULT TASK
The difficult, task of overacting a
part but not overacting the over
net ing was carried off surprisingly
well by the players. Garrett Star
mer in the part of the hero, Asher
Wilson as the villain and Mary Mc-
Clerkin as the heroine were espe
cially good, and praise for between
acts skits should go especially to
Mrs. F. Cowles Strickland for her
rendition of "Lulu Is Our Darling
Bride," and to Harry Muheim, who
sang "Daddy's on the Engine" in
true Bowery style.
The plot (and in those days they
spelled plot, with a capital P), which
is usually more or less ignored in
modern renditions of "mellerdra
mas," is followed through faithfully
by the players, and the audience
was rather surprised to find itself
very interested in it. The sad story
(it incredibly innocent people beset
by an incredibly wicked villain in
incredibly numerous ways, the stir
ring moral the Goodness Will Out
in (he End, and the beauty of love
: between two pcc-ure persons as con
; trasted to the selfishness of the
j money-mad gives an interesting as
i well as amusing picture of the senti
ments and ideals of 19th century
America.
Complete with corn-flake snow
[ storm, horse(alive)-drawn carriage
i and burning house, the set is one
| of the most elaborate yet
by the players. The versatility and
J techniea- auinty of Waidemar Jo
| Hansen and his assistants continues
to be one of the Seven Wonders of
j Stanford, and once again the play
ers have proved themselves one of
the most able groups of dramatists
to be found on an American campus.

America.
Complete with corn-flake snow
[ storm, horse(alive)-drawn carriage
i and burning house, the set is one

by the players. The versatility and
J techniea- auinty of Waidemar Jo

to be one of the Seven Wonders of
j Stanford, and once again the play
ers have proved themselves one of
the most able groups of dramatists
to be found on an American campus.
Amid the hisses and "shouts of
approbation" of a small but appre
ciative Memorial Theater audience,
the Stanford Players last night
poked fun at the theater of yester
day with a rollicking performance
of what was once the toast of the
New York stage—Dion Boucicault's
"The Poor of New York."
With Valentino - like gestures,
rending sobs and a musical back
ground of "Hearts and Flowers,"
!he Players proved beyond a doubt
that Poverty is Noble and Goodness
Ever Conquers Gold. Besides that,
the Players proved again that they
are as talented and versatile a group
of actors as can be found on an
American campus.
Moreover, there was a respon
siveness and genuine feeling of en
joyment in last night's audience
that had not been present since last
year's comedy success, "The War
rior's Husband." The hilarious over
acting, the touched-up lines, and
the between-acts cutting up got
more laughs from the audience than
any of the regular comedies so far
attempted.
DIFFICULT TASK
The difficult, task of overacting a
part but not overacting the over
net ing was carried off surprisingly
well by the players. Garrett Star
mer in the part of the hero, Asher
Wilson as the villain and Mary Mc-
Clerkin as the heroine were espe
cially good, and praise for between
acts skits should go especially to
Mrs. F. Cowles Strickland for her
rendition of "Lulu Is Our Darling
Bride," and to Harry Muheim, who
sang "Daddy's on the Engine" in
true Bowery style.
