# Players Romp Through 1857 Melodrama
## 
### VIC MINAHAN 
Amid the hisses and "shouts of
approbation" of a small but appre
ciative Memorial Theater audience,
the Stanford Players last night
poked fun at the theater of yester
day with a rollicking performance
of what was once the toast of the
New York stage—Dion Boucicault's
"The Poor of New York."
With Valentino - like gestures,
rending sobs and a musical back

Mrs. F. Cowles Strickland for her
rendition of "Lulu Is Our Darling
Bride," and to Harry Muheim, who
sang "Daddy's on the Engine" in
true Bowery style.
The plot (and in those days they
spelled plot, with a capital P), which
is usually more or less ignored in
modern renditions of "mellerdra
mas," is followed through faithfully
by the players, and the audience
was rather surprised to find itself
very interested in it. The sad story

by an incredibly wicked villain in
incredibly numerous ways, the stir
