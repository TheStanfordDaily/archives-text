# Squad Heads Northward After Rousing Sendoff
## 
### 
Stanford wants to go to the Rose Bowl, and .'5OO victory-flushed rooters
threw a brawl at the Espee station yesterday afternoon that proved it.
Those .'5OO whooping Indians sounded like a million, for they want a
Cougar's scalp that means one more hurdle out of their path to the New

Year's game.
They showed those 37 men on the |
traveling squad just how much they
want a win over Washington State
in tomorrow's crucial tussle, as roar
after deafening roar greeted indi
vidual Card grid stars and coaches
as they lined up to catch the train
that is carrying them north to
Pullman.
COACH CLARK SPEAKS
Coach Clark Shaughnessy climbed
up on a baggage wagon, slowly
spread his big Irish grin over the
expectant mob, and gave them both
barrels:
"The boys are going up there to do
their dead level bestâ€”and may the
better team win. BUT I SURE
HOPE IT'S STANFORD!"
Assistant coaches Marchy Schwartz
and Phil Bengston each gave the
rooters the good word, and brief
talks were made by Pete Kmetovic,
Chuck Taylor, Norm Standlee, Hugh
Gallarneau, Frankie Albert, and
Bruno Banducci.
ALBERT 'CONFIDENT'
"We're not sleeping four nights
on a train just to get our noses rub
bed in dirt; I'm confident we're go
ing to win," exclaimcd a smoothly
dressed Albert.
Answering the gang's shouts for
"The Chief," modest Standlee took
his place on the baggage wagon,
murmuring to himself, "Gee, I'll tie
up."
Meanwhile, solid Ed McCain, talk
ing to an admiring brunette, came
forth with an "Aw, chee, it won't
be nothin' " smile.
NEAR ACCIDENT
Clambering down from the roof of
the nearly-completed station, an un
fortunate co-ed disrupted the entire
rally for two or three minutes by
catching her skirt, on a board. She
could proceed neither up nor down
the ladder without embarrassing re
sults, and when her efforts were
finally successful the crowd gave
her a resounding cheer. That color
on her cheeks wasn't rouge, either.
Preceding the rally, a caravan of
cars formed at the Fiji house, and
serpentined down the campus to the
station, where they rode out on the
new Indian yell with the three trum
peteers.
A hopeful mob .sent ofT Stanford's
most powerful team in four years to
another expected victory yesterday,
to the tunc of the Stanford Hymn.
