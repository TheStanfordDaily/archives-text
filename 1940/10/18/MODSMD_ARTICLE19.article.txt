# Cardinals Plan Charter Study
## 
### 
Cardinals, in their regular Wed
nesday night meeting, appointed a
subcommittee to work hand in hand
with a similar Excom body in an ef
fort to settle the current controversy
regarding Cardinals' system of ap
pointments.
Chairman Ned Pugh appointed
Stan Glikbarg and Betty Moses to
investigate the two constitutional
points under fire and subsequently
to mefct with an Ex Committee sub
committee composed of Anne Town
send and Ross Anderson to work out
their differences.
According to A.S.S.U. President
Bruce Jessup, both Excom and
Cardinals concur in the belief that
a more equitable, more just system
can be hit upon to take the place of
the unpopular self-perpetuating plan
under which Cardinals now oper
ates.
DOING JOB WELL'
"It is not necessary for Cardi
nals to 'save its face'," Jessup said.
"In spite of the present controversy,
I am sure the students will acknowl
edge that Cardinals is doing a hard
job and doing it well. The main
thing, however, is to be sure that a
just solution is found."
The issues raised by Daily Editor
Dwight Hutchinson in a series of
editorials this week referred to con
stitutional provisions which made
Cardinals exempt from Excom's in
terference except on matters of pol
icy. Naturally, the self-perpetuating
system does not come under this
head.
The plan proposed by Hutchinson
sought to bring the two bodies into
closer relationship, with Excom hav
ing the right to dissent on matters
other than those of policy.
