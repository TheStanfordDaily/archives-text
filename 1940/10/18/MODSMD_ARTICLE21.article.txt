# Winning Cardinal Team To Face Mighty Cougar Aerial Attack Tomorrow
## 'Breather' Tilt Looms as Close Gridiron Battle 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Now rolling north some place in
Oregon, Stanford's varsity football
team is headed for one of those ugly
situations which now and then rear
themselves on the gridiron horizon—
a game which was scheduled as a
breather but which has turned into
a potential battle.
Last year the Washington Stale
Cougars were pressing the Indians
for that cellar position and so when
the 1940 schedules were made up,
these Cougars were sandwiched in
between two of the Cards' tougher
opponents, Santa Clara and U.S.C.
But the football metamorphosis
which has taken place up on the
Washington State campus can only
be outshined by what has happened
right here on the Farm. In 1939 the
Cougars won only two one-touch
down victories in the conference
over Stanford and Washington.
COUGARS NO PUSHOVER
Tomorrow, however, Stanford
will face no pushover but an eleven
which startled the Coast Confer
ence by outplaying to a tie. the team
everybody expected to make its
third straight trip to the Rose Bowl,
U.S.C. To prove this w;is no fluke,
Coach Babe Hollingbery's Cougars
then smothered Montana 21-0 and
humbled California 9-6.
Washington State's success this
year can be credited to three sources.
First and foremost is the fact that
Hollingbery's team this season has
what it has lacked during the past
years of thier grid famine—a stub
born line with plenty of dependable
replacements. This line proved it
self in the season's opener playing
in the unaccustomed h(?at of South
ern California against a hard-hitting
team.
Secondly, it has one of the most
talented passers on the Coast in 24-
year-old Billy Sewell. It was Se
well's passes that put the Cougars
back into the S.C. game and which
gained the tremendous total of 19.'i
yards against the Trojans. And in
the California tilt Sewell's pitches
accounted for over half the Cougar
yardage as he completed the high
average of 12 out of 17 attempts.
STARS ON COUGAR TEAM
The third factor in Washington
State's so far successful 1940 season
is the kicking toe of tackle Stan
Johnson. It was Johnson's accuracy
which kept the northerners in the
running against S. C. with two for
two conversions, and it was Johnson
who kicked the deciding field goal
against the Bears up in Berkeley.
A few other cogs in the threaten
ing Cougar eleven are Dale Gentry,
an end and Sewell's best and fa
vorite pass receiver, Les McClen
nan and Dick Eenfro, a couple of
powerhousing fullbacks, Don Greely,
a hard-blocking quarterback, and
Felix Fletcher, Sewell's running
mate at halfback.

On the other hand, the Cards
have their own supply of stars. And
the question in the minds of their
coaches is whether these stars will
be in the right mental condition to
perform tomorrow as expertly as
they have on the last, three suc
cessive Saturday afternoons.
STANFORD LINE STRONG
Shaughnessy has flankmen to
slash and to turn in end runs in
Stan Graff, Freddie Meyer, Hank
Norberg, Bill Willard, and Arnold
Meiners and fast ends to rush the
feet off Sewell on his passes, to
cover puns, and to do a little pass
t receiving on their own in Clemmie
Tcmmerlin and Bob Ditlevsen.
He has one extremely fast charg
| ing tackle who will be right with
| the ends on Sewell's neck when
i he fades to pitch in Bruno Banducci.
j Playing a more of a Rook-of-Gibral
j tar, waiting game i? Rod Warnecke,
i Shaughnessy's other starting tackle,
j Behind these two will be the steady
I and improving Ed Stamm and 1
Claude Purkitt, plus the newly !
groomed tackles, Ed McCain and
Bill Mannon.
Chuck Taylor is just as hard and |
fast a charger as Banducci and will j
also probably spend some time in j
i the Cougar backfield. Along with
j Taylor at guard will be the de- i
! lensive strategist, Dick Palmer. Be
hind these two are the able Ken
Robesky, Jack Francis, Chick Orme,
and John Kerman.
Helping Palmer at the important
job of line backing will be center
Vic Lindskog who has Doug Stable
and Jake Thompson as his under
studies.
In that lightning fast backfield of
Shaughnessy's in the key quarter
back spot will be Frankie Albert to
call the signals and throw the
| passes. Behind Albert are sopho
i more Bay Hammett and senior Thor
Peterson, who is now in shape for a
little action.
Those super swift halfbacks will
be "Sceeter Peter" Kmetovic and
Hugh Gallarneau. Just as potent
running threats but not as seasoned
are the small, chunky, and mighty
tricky second stringers, Eric Arm
strong and A1 Cole.

Carrying the spearhead of the In
dian attack will be fullback Norm
Standlee, whose running, kicking,
and even passing will add toward a
Stanford victory in Pullman. Chief's
■ understudies are Milt Vucinich and
I Bob Crane in that order.

Cougars were pressing the Indians
for that cellar position and so when
the 1940 schedules were made up,
these Cougars were sandwiched in
between two of the Cards' tougher
opponents, Santa Clara and U.S.C.
But the football metamorphosis
which has taken place up on the
Washington State campus can only
be outshined by what has happened
right here on the Farm. In 1939 the
Cougars won only two one-touch
down victories in the conference
over Stanford and Washington.
COUGARS NO PUSHOVER
Tomorrow, however, Stanford
will face no pushover but an eleven
which startled the Coast Confer
ence by outplaying to a tie. the team
everybody expected to make its
third straight trip to the Rose Bowl,
U.S.C. To prove this w;is no fluke,
Coach Babe Hollingbery's Cougars
then smothered Montana 21-0 and
humbled California 9-6.
Washington State's success this
year can be credited to three sources.
First and foremost is the fact that
Hollingbery's team this season has
what it has lacked during the past
years of thier grid famine—a stub
born line with plenty of dependable
replacements. This line proved it
self in the season's opener playing
in the unaccustomed h(?at of South
ern California against a hard-hitting
team.
Secondly, it has one of the most
talented passers on the Coast in 24-
year-old Billy Sewell. It was Se
well's passes that put the Cougars
back into the S.C. game and which
gained the tremendous total of 19.'i
yards against the Trojans. And in
the California tilt Sewell's pitches
accounted for over half the Cougar
yardage as he completed the high
average of 12 out of 17 attempts.
STARS ON COUGAR TEAM
The third factor in Washington
State's so far successful 1940 season
is the kicking toe of tackle Stan
Johnson. It was Johnson's accuracy
which kept the northerners in the
running against S. C. with two for
two conversions, and it was Johnson
who kicked the deciding field goal
against the Bears up in Berkeley.
A few other cogs in the threaten
ing Cougar eleven are Dale Gentry,
an end and Sewell's best and fa
vorite pass receiver, Les McClen
nan and Dick Eenfro, a couple of
powerhousing fullbacks, Don Greely,
a hard-blocking quarterback, and
Felix Fletcher, Sewell's running
mate at halfback.

On the other hand, the Cards
have their own supply of stars. And
the question in the minds of their
coaches is whether these stars will
be in the right mental condition to
perform tomorrow as expertly as
they have on the last, three suc
cessive Saturday afternoons.
STANFORD LINE STRONG
Shaughnessy has flankmen to
slash and to turn in end runs in
Stan Graff, Freddie Meyer, Hank
Norberg, Bill Willard, and Arnold
Meiners and fast ends to rush the
feet off Sewell on his passes, to
cover puns, and to do a little pass
t receiving on their own in Clemmie
Tcmmerlin and Bob Ditlevsen.
He has one extremely fast charg
| ing tackle who will be right with
| the ends on Sewell's neck when
i he fades to pitch in Bruno Banducci.
j Playing a more of a Rook-of-Gibral
j tar, waiting game i? Rod Warnecke,
i Shaughnessy's other starting tackle,
j Behind these two will be the steady
I and improving Ed Stamm and 1
Claude Purkitt, plus the newly !
groomed tackles, Ed McCain and
Bill Mannon.
Chuck Taylor is just as hard and |
fast a charger as Banducci and will j
also probably spend some time in j
i the Cougar backfield. Along with
j Taylor at guard will be the de- i
! lensive strategist, Dick Palmer. Be
hind these two are the able Ken
Robesky, Jack Francis, Chick Orme,
and John Kerman.
Helping Palmer at the important
job of line backing will be center
Vic Lindskog who has Doug Stable
and Jake Thompson as his under
studies.
In that lightning fast backfield of
Shaughnessy's in the key quarter
back spot will be Frankie Albert to
call the signals and throw the
| passes. Behind Albert are sopho
i more Bay Hammett and senior Thor
Peterson, who is now in shape for a
little action.
Those super swift halfbacks will
be "Sceeter Peter" Kmetovic and
Hugh Gallarneau. Just as potent
running threats but not as seasoned
are the small, chunky, and mighty
tricky second stringers, Eric Arm
strong and A1 Cole.

Carrying the spearhead of the In
dian attack will be fullback Norm
Standlee, whose running, kicking,
and even passing will add toward a
Stanford victory in Pullman. Chief's
■ understudies are Milt Vucinich and
I Bob Crane in that order.
Now rolling north some place in
Oregon, Stanford's varsity football
team is headed for one of those ugly
situations which now and then rear
themselves on the gridiron horizon—
a game which was scheduled as a
breather but which has turned into
a potential battle.

right here on the Farm. In 1939 the
Cougars won only two one-touch
down victories in the conference
over Stanford and Washington.
COUGARS NO PUSHOVER
Tomorrow, however, Stanford
will face no pushover but an eleven
which startled the Coast Confer
ence by outplaying to a tie. the team
everybody expected to make its
third straight trip to the Rose Bowl,
U.S.C. To prove this w;is no fluke,
Coach Babe Hollingbery's Cougars
then smothered Montana 21-0 and
humbled California 9-6.
Washington State's success this
year can be credited to three sources.
First and foremost is the fact that
Hollingbery's team this season has
what it has lacked during the past
years of thier grid famine—a stub
born line with plenty of dependable
replacements. This line proved it
self in the season's opener playing
in the unaccustomed h(?at of South
ern California against a hard-hitting
team.
Secondly, it has one of the most
talented passers on the Coast in 24-
year-old Billy Sewell. It was Se
well's passes that put the Cougars
back into the S.C. game and which
gained the tremendous total of 19.'i
yards against the Trojans. And in
the California tilt Sewell's pitches
accounted for over half the Cougar
yardage as he completed the high
average of 12 out of 17 attempts.
STARS ON COUGAR TEAM
The third factor in Washington
State's so far successful 1940 season
is the kicking toe of tackle Stan
Johnson. It was Johnson's accuracy
which kept the northerners in the
running against S. C. with two for
two conversions, and it was Johnson
who kicked the deciding field goal
against the Bears up in Berkeley.
A few other cogs in the threaten
ing Cougar eleven are Dale Gentry,
an end and Sewell's best and fa
vorite pass receiver, Les McClen
nan and Dick Eenfro, a couple of
powerhousing fullbacks, Don Greely,
a hard-blocking quarterback, and
Felix Fletcher, Sewell's running
mate at halfback.

On the other hand, the Cards
have their own supply of stars. And
the question in the minds of their
coaches is whether these stars will
be in the right mental condition to
perform tomorrow as expertly as
they have on the last, three suc
cessive Saturday afternoons.
STANFORD LINE STRONG
Shaughnessy has flankmen to
slash and to turn in end runs in
Stan Graff, Freddie Meyer, Hank
Norberg, Bill Willard, and Arnold
Meiners and fast ends to rush the
feet off Sewell on his passes, to
cover puns, and to do a little pass
t receiving on their own in Clemmie
Tcmmerlin and Bob Ditlevsen.
He has one extremely fast charg
| ing tackle who will be right with
| the ends on Sewell's neck when
i he fades to pitch in Bruno Banducci.
j Playing a more of a Rook-of-Gibral
j tar, waiting game i? Rod Warnecke,
i Shaughnessy's other starting tackle,
j Behind these two will be the steady
I and improving Ed Stamm and 1
Claude Purkitt, plus the newly !
groomed tackles, Ed McCain and
Bill Mannon.
Chuck Taylor is just as hard and |
fast a charger as Banducci and will j
also probably spend some time in j
i the Cougar backfield. Along with
j Taylor at guard will be the de- i
! lensive strategist, Dick Palmer. Be
hind these two are the able Ken
Robesky, Jack Francis, Chick Orme,
and John Kerman.
Helping Palmer at the important
job of line backing will be center
Vic Lindskog who has Doug Stable
and Jake Thompson as his under
studies.
In that lightning fast backfield of
Shaughnessy's in the key quarter
back spot will be Frankie Albert to
call the signals and throw the
| passes. Behind Albert are sopho
i more Bay Hammett and senior Thor
Peterson, who is now in shape for a
little action.
Those super swift halfbacks will
be "Sceeter Peter" Kmetovic and
Hugh Gallarneau. Just as potent
running threats but not as seasoned
are the small, chunky, and mighty
tricky second stringers, Eric Arm
strong and A1 Cole.

Carrying the spearhead of the In
dian attack will be fullback Norm
Standlee, whose running, kicking,
and even passing will add toward a
Stanford victory in Pullman. Chief's
■ understudies are Milt Vucinich and
I Bob Crane in that order.
Now rolling north some place in
Oregon, Stanford's varsity football
team is headed for one of those ugly
situations which now and then rear
themselves on the gridiron horizon—
a game which was scheduled as a
breather but which has turned into
a potential battle.
Last year the Washington Stale
Cougars were pressing the Indians
for that cellar position and so when
the 1940 schedules were made up,
these Cougars were sandwiched in
between two of the Cards' tougher
opponents, Santa Clara and U.S.C.
But the football metamorphosis
which has taken place up on the
Washington State campus can only
be outshined by what has happened
right here on the Farm. In 1939 the
