TOKYO. Friday, Oct. 18 (UP). â€”Reopening of the Burma munitions
highway into Nationalist China was viewed here today as another proof
lli.it Britain and the United States intend to follow "a consistent inter
ventionist policy" toward the Chinese-Japanese conflict.
Newspapers joined with unofficial spokesmen in blaming President
Roosevelt and his administration for the reopening of the road, over which

American materials for the
.11 machine again are rolling into
China, and warned the American
I- ople they "are being misled by
adventurous statesmanship which
takes 110 account of the dangerous
possibilities of its actions."
