# Germans Fire On Canterbury
## Hitler's Raiders Bomb Historic Cathedral 
### 
LONDON, Oct. 17 (UP).â€”Nazi
bombs Thursday night smashed
London houses and buried civilians
beneath heaps of debris after day
long dive-bombing attacks that
damaged two hospitals in southeast
England and the deanery of historic
Canterbury Cathedral, pueviously
scarred by blitzkrieg blows.
London's 4lst night of terror from
the sky brought Nazi raiders
sweeping in from several sides
against a wall of anti-aircraft fire.
One bomb crumbled four houses
in London, trapping residents in
heaps of bricks and mortar. Rescue
squads rushed to the scene and be
gan digging as more bombs crashed
around them.
To the terror of their bombings,
the Nazi raiders added what was
described as "ruthless" machine
gun strafing of streets
MACHINE-GUN COAST
One raider swept low and sprayed
machine-gun fire along the sea
front along the southeast coast. An
other gunned the streets of a vil
lage.
A London apartment house was
blasted by five bombs which fell on
and around it. Two adjoining houses
were damaged. On the London
outskirts a bomb gouged a great
crater in the street near a church,
bursting a gas main and damaging
windows and the roof of the church
hall.
A squadron of Nazi dive-bombers
dropped about 20 bombs with de
structive effect around Canterbury
Cathedral, mother church of the
Empire famous in fable and history.
CHURCH BLASTED
Three of the bombs fell near the
cathedral, damaging the deanery
and shattering more windows in
the cathedral itself. One blasted a
crater in the front garden of the
deanery within 40 yards of the an
cient shrine.
Hampered by clouds which had
hung over southern England, the
Germans earlier had appeared to
be concentrating their efforts along
the coast. They were heard over
towns in both southeast and south
west England.
