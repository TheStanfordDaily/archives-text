Stimson said on Sept. 6, when
Congress provided the first appro
priations for army housing, existing
accommodations at regular army
and National Guard camps were
suitable for only 30.000 men.
From funds provided since, the
War Department h'is awarded con

ments, each capable of housing at
I least one division, and 204 other
| housing projects—Stimson said.
Stimson's announcement of ini- :

tial conscription dates came after
Clarence A. Dykstra officially took
over the duties of national draft di
rector.
Conscription officials prepared for
the next big draft step—the national
lottery which will determine even
tually which of the registrants will
be among the 800,000 to be called up
between Nov. 18 and June 15 and
the order in which they will be
called.
On the basis of early registration
returns, officials estimated the total
number of registrants might run
nearly 2 per cent above the original
estimate (16.404,000) and would ap
proach a total of 17,000,000.
It was expected that all serial
numbers for those who registered
would be posted at local draft board
headquarters by the end of the week
in states where such boards already
have been set up. It's up to the
registrant to find out what his num
ber is.
