## 
### 
Six Stanford students who spent
from six weeks to two months in
Japan, Manchukuo and Korea this
summer will tell of the impressions
gleaned during their travels for the
Tuesday Evening Lecture Scries
Oct. 22. The speakers were mem
boi's of the Seventh America-Japan
Student Conference, which was at
tended by 58 representatives from
the United States.

Those who will tell of various
phases of their stay in the Orient
are Marlyn Whedon, Kay Kitagawa,
Bill Turner, Roy Vitousek, Hugh
O'Donnell, who was treasurer for
the American contingent, and Ned
Pugh, who was its chairman. Pugh
will be the last of the series of
speakers, and will discuss the effects
of the Chino-Japanesc war in Japan.
"None of us will try to interpret
or draw conclusions," Pugh said.
"We will tell what we observed and
let the audience draw conclusions."
The chairman spent two months
in the Far East, as did Kay Kita
gawa. The delegation left the Uni
ted States the last of June, and
returned at the beginning of Sep
tember; the Americans were guests
at all times of Japanese students
during their travels.
