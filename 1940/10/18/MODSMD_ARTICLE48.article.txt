# Junior Colleges To Meet Here In Conference
## Former Stanford Professor to Lead Open Discussions 
### 
Special two-year courses in the
semiprofessional field for junior col
lege students will be the subject of
discussion at the Northern California
Junior College Association Confer
ence to be held here tomorrow.
Dr. Walter Eells, former Stanford
University professor, who is secre
tary of the American Association of
Junior Colleges and director of the
Commission on Junior College
Terminal Education, will preside.
The purpose is "to discover what
the junior colleges are offering and
what they ought to offer, especially
for students who will not continue
their formal education beyond the
two junior college years."
ONE OF SERIES
The conference is one of a na
tionwide series, beginning in Boston,
Sept. 28 and closing in New York
on Nov. 4. Supplementing four
similar conferences held last spring,
they are intended to cover all of
the 600 junior colleges in the coun
try as part of an investigation being
conducted by the Commission on
Junior College Terminal Education.
The conferences will be open to
faculty, administrators, student rep
resentatives and board members of
the junior colleges of northern' Cali
fornia, representatives of the State
Department of Education, NYA ad
ministrators, university and col
lege administrators, and other edu
cators and laymen interested.
"With 3,500,000 young people out
of school and out of work in the
United States, there ought to be
four times as many college fresh
men and sophomores as there are.
Large numbers of them could profit
by courses designed to prepare them
for semiprofessional and skilled vo
cations. Junior colleges throughout
the country are awake to this situa
tion and are undertaking to meet it,"
Dr. Eells said.
