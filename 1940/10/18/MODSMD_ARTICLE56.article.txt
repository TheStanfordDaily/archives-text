### JERRY BRUCKER 
JT'S going to be (he battle of the
dark horses tomorrow afternoon
when the Indians tee off against
W.S.C. up at Pullman. Babe Holling
bery's wrecking crew, usually the
conference doormat, served notice
when they tied S.C. in the opener
this fall that they were going after
the works.
Clark Shaughnessy's Skyrocket,
consigned to the nether regions in
September, has been boring into the
stratosphere in its first three games.
Just how far they will go still re
mains to be seen.
Frankly, the Indians look like
(he better team, but the Cou
gars will enjoy a tremendous psy
chological advantage. They'll be
playing on a home field on which
they have lost but a handful of
games. They'll perform before a
large homecoming crowd yelling
for Cardinal blood. They'll very
probably be on the lower end of
the odds.
Against all this will be a Stanford
team trying to squeeze in a vic
tory between the Santa Clara win
and an encounter with the might of
Troy in the Stadium next week, a
team that will suffer a natural let
down after the peak reached against
the Broncs.

T>ILL SEWELL is the name of the
man Stanford must stop tomor
row in order to come out on top.
Sewell, at this early date, is by far
the classiest passer on the Coast,
may turn out to be the best in the
country.
His success over in Berkeley
last Saturday may be partially
credited to a lax California de
fense, but any man that can pitch
his team into a tie with the ter
rible Tro. : ans must have a lot 011
the ball.
The Indians didn't look any too
good on pass defense against Santa
Clara. Though the Broncs didn't
complete many of their tosses, they
scored the first touchdown against
Stanford via the aerial route, and
several times early in the game the
receivers were wide open but the
passer, Johnson, could not get the
ball to them.
Sewell won't have that trouble. If
the receivers are clear, he'll hit 'em.
Stanford will have to provide a
hard-charging line and a very alert
secondary, in that order, to stop the
threat, and at that the Cougars
might click for a touchdown or
two.

The W.S.C. flash has another vir
tue, he's a pretty fair country
punter. While Norm Standlee was
compiling a 48.2 average per kick
Saturday. Sewell was kicking them
44.5 yards per try across the bay.

nPHE Indians can turn on a pretty
nice passing- attack of their
own if they feel like it. Frankie
Albert hasn't been hitting- very
consistently so far this fail, but if
and when he has a hot day the
results will be sensational.

Behind Albert in the quarterback
spot is Sophomore Ray Hammett.
Hammett has thrown only one pass
in varsity competition, and that
sailed about ten yards over the re
ceiver's head, but he has pitched a
lot of strikes in practice. He throws
a nice flat, fast spiral.

Thor Peterson is back in condi
tion, and if he plays he may decide
to do a little passing on his own
hook. The hard luck kid definitely
knows how to throw the ball, but has
missed so much practice that his
accuracy is a matter of question.

While on the subject, it may be
well to mention that the numbers
one and two fullbacks, Norm Stand
lee and Milt Vucinich, also have a
speaking acquaintance with the art,
as do halfbacks A1 Cole and Cookie
South.

Lucky Louie turns in the follow
ing picks for the week-end's games:
Stanford over W.S.C. — liy two
touchdowns.
U.C.L.A. over Cal — Dark horse
Robinson.
Oregon over U.S.C.—Strictly for
laughs.
Washington over O.S.C. — Runs
with blinkers.
U.S.F. over San Jose State—Danc
ing in the dark.
Tennessee over Alabama—Maybe.
Ohio State over Minnesota—And
maybe not.
St. Mary's over Loyola—Bad post
actor.
Fordhani over Pitt—Charges fast
in stretch.
Texas A & M over T.C.U.—Kim
brough up.

man Stanford must stop tomor
row in order to come out on top.
Sewell, at this early date, is by far
the classiest passer on the Coast,
may turn out to be the best in the
country.
His success over in Berkeley
last Saturday may be partially
credited to a lax California de
fense, but any man that can pitch
his team into a tie with the ter
rible Tro. : ans must have a lot 011
the ball.
The Indians didn't look any too
good on pass defense against Santa
Clara. Though the Broncs didn't
complete many of their tosses, they
scored the first touchdown against
Stanford via the aerial route, and
several times early in the game the
receivers were wide open but the
passer, Johnson, could not get the
ball to them.
Sewell won't have that trouble. If
the receivers are clear, he'll hit 'em.
Stanford will have to provide a
hard-charging line and a very alert
secondary, in that order, to stop the
threat, and at that the Cougars
might click for a touchdown or
two.

The W.S.C. flash has another vir
tue, he's a pretty fair country
punter. While Norm Standlee was
compiling a 48.2 average per kick
Saturday. Sewell was kicking them
44.5 yards per try across the bay.

nPHE Indians can turn on a pretty
nice passing- attack of their
own if they feel like it. Frankie
Albert hasn't been hitting- very
consistently so far this fail, but if
and when he has a hot day the
results will be sensational.

Behind Albert in the quarterback
spot is Sophomore Ray Hammett.
Hammett has thrown only one pass
in varsity competition, and that
sailed about ten yards over the re
ceiver's head, but he has pitched a
lot of strikes in practice. He throws
a nice flat, fast spiral.

Thor Peterson is back in condi
tion, and if he plays he may decide
to do a little passing on his own
hook. The hard luck kid definitely
knows how to throw the ball, but has
missed so much practice that his
accuracy is a matter of question.

While on the subject, it may be
well to mention that the numbers
one and two fullbacks, Norm Stand
lee and Milt Vucinich, also have a
speaking acquaintance with the art,
as do halfbacks A1 Cole and Cookie
South.

Lucky Louie turns in the follow
ing picks for the week-end's games:
Stanford over W.S.C. — liy two
touchdowns.
U.C.L.A. over Cal — Dark horse
Robinson.
Oregon over U.S.C.—Strictly for
laughs.
Washington over O.S.C. — Runs
with blinkers.
U.S.F. over San Jose State—Danc
ing in the dark.
Tennessee over Alabama—Maybe.
Ohio State over Minnesota—And
maybe not.
St. Mary's over Loyola—Bad post
actor.
Fordhani over Pitt—Charges fast
in stretch.
Texas A & M over T.C.U.—Kim
brough up.
JT'S going to be (he battle of the
dark horses tomorrow afternoon
when the Indians tee off against
W.S.C. up at Pullman. Babe Holling
bery's wrecking crew, usually the
conference doormat, served notice
when they tied S.C. in the opener
this fall that they were going after
the works.
Clark Shaughnessy's Skyrocket,
consigned to the nether regions in
September, has been boring into the
stratosphere in its first three games.
Just how far they will go still re
mains to be seen.
Frankly, the Indians look like
(he better team, but the Cou
gars will enjoy a tremendous psy
chological advantage. They'll be
playing on a home field on which
they have lost but a handful of
games. They'll perform before a
large homecoming crowd yelling
for Cardinal blood. They'll very
probably be on the lower end of
the odds.
Against all this will be a Stanford
team trying to squeeze in a vic
tory between the Santa Clara win
and an encounter with the might of
Troy in the Stadium next week, a
team that will suffer a natural let
down after the peak reached against
the Broncs.

compiling a 48.2 average per kick
Saturday. Sewell was kicking them
44.5 yards per try across the bay.

nPHE Indians can turn on a pretty
nice passing- attack of their
own if they feel like it. Frankie
Albert hasn't been hitting- very
consistently so far this fail, but if
and when he has a hot day the
results will be sensational.

Behind Albert in the quarterback
spot is Sophomore Ray Hammett.
Hammett has thrown only one pass
in varsity competition, and that
sailed about ten yards over the re
ceiver's head, but he has pitched a
lot of strikes in practice. He throws
a nice flat, fast spiral.

Thor Peterson is back in condi
tion, and if he plays he may decide
to do a little passing on his own
hook. The hard luck kid definitely
knows how to throw the ball, but has
missed so much practice that his
accuracy is a matter of question.

While on the subject, it may be
well to mention that the numbers
one and two fullbacks, Norm Stand
lee and Milt Vucinich, also have a
speaking acquaintance with the art,
as do halfbacks A1 Cole and Cookie
South.

Lucky Louie turns in the follow
ing picks for the week-end's games:
Stanford over W.S.C. — liy two
touchdowns.
U.C.L.A. over Cal — Dark horse
Robinson.
Oregon over U.S.C.—Strictly for
laughs.
Washington over O.S.C. — Runs
with blinkers.
U.S.F. over San Jose State—Danc
ing in the dark.
Tennessee over Alabama—Maybe.
Ohio State over Minnesota—And
maybe not.
St. Mary's over Loyola—Bad post
actor.
Fordhani over Pitt—Charges fast
in stretch.
Texas A & M over T.C.U.—Kim
brough up.
JT'S going to be (he battle of the
dark horses tomorrow afternoon
when the Indians tee off against
W.S.C. up at Pullman. Babe Holling
bery's wrecking crew, usually the
conference doormat, served notice
when they tied S.C. in the opener
this fall that they were going after
the works.
Clark Shaughnessy's Skyrocket,
consigned to the nether regions in
September, has been boring into the
stratosphere in its first three games.
Just how far they will go still re
mains to be seen.
Frankly, the Indians look like
(he better team, but the Cou
gars will enjoy a tremendous psy
chological advantage. They'll be
playing on a home field on which
they have lost but a handful of
games. They'll perform before a
large homecoming crowd yelling
for Cardinal blood. They'll very
probably be on the lower end of
the odds.
Against all this will be a Stanford
team trying to squeeze in a vic
tory between the Santa Clara win
and an encounter with the might of
Troy in the Stadium next week, a
team that will suffer a natural let
down after the peak reached against
the Broncs.

T>ILL SEWELL is the name of the
man Stanford must stop tomor
row in order to come out on top.
Sewell, at this early date, is by far
the classiest passer on the Coast,
may turn out to be the best in the
country.
His success over in Berkeley
last Saturday may be partially
credited to a lax California de
fense, but any man that can pitch
his team into a tie with the ter
rible Tro. : ans must have a lot 011
the ball.
The Indians didn't look any too
good on pass defense against Santa
Clara. Though the Broncs didn't
complete many of their tosses, they
scored the first touchdown against
Stanford via the aerial route, and
several times early in the game the
receivers were wide open but the
passer, Johnson, could not get the
ball to them.
Sewell won't have that trouble. If
the receivers are clear, he'll hit 'em.
Stanford will have to provide a
hard-charging line and a very alert
secondary, in that order, to stop the
threat, and at that the Cougars
might click for a touchdown or
two.

The W.S.C. flash has another vir
tue, he's a pretty fair country
punter. While Norm Standlee was
compiling a 48.2 average per kick
Saturday. Sewell was kicking them
44.5 yards per try across the bay.
