## 
### 
The Papoose soccer team takes on
Pescadero High School in their sec
ond game of the season this after
noon on the local field.

The frosh were tied in their first
' game Tuesday by Menlo J. C., but
will have to improve to do the same
today as they meet a higher class of
competition in the team from Pesca
dero. Coach Tevik Sadullah sent
the squad through a stiff workout
Wednesday, but gave the boys a
rest yesterday in preparation for
the game.
