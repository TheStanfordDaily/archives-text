# BRITISH MAY GET SWEDISH PLANES
## 
### 

SEVENTY-FIVE MODERN bombing planes built for Sweden at the Republic aviation plant. East Farming
dale, Long Island, may be taken over by the British government. Transfer would come about through the
Faddis bill, which gives the U. S. government power to acquire all American-made war material no mat
ter who it was intended for. Above, one of the planes in flight. Note the triple crown of Sweden on the
fuselage.
