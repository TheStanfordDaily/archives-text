# Frosh to Meet Modesto
## Shipkeymen Seek Fourth Straight Win 
### DON SELBY 
After their third consecutive
victory of the season, a big squad
of I'apoose gridders will trot out
onto the turf in the Stanford Sta
dium tomorrow afternoon at 2
o'clock to meet Modesto Junior
College.
Should the frosh cop the contest,
they will have won half of their '
Raines for the season, for there are
only three more teams on the Pa- |
poose schedule—U.S.C. Frosh, Chaf- |
fey J.C., and California Frosh in !
that order. However, if the Pirates j
come through under game condi- j
tions with the potentialities they i
have shown in early season practice, j
Coach Harry Shipkey's charges will |
have a tough battle on their hands. j
The yearlings, having defeated ]
both San Mateo J. C. and U.C.L.A.
frosh, will probably be favored in j
tomorrow's clash, for the Modesto- j
ans have dropped two of their three
games thus far. Against Stanford, |
however, the Pirates will have the
use of two of their stars, Chuck Co- |
ker and Charles Labno, who have I
been on the sidelines with injuries. !
PASS DEFENSE GOOD
Against the passing of Coker, the j
Frosh will match Bob Mitchell and !
Bob Koch, both of whom have been |
very successful on the tossing end
of Stanford's aerial attack. Then,
too, the yearlings' unscored-on rec
ord speaks well for their pass de
fense. To offset their proven pass
ing offense, the frosh expect to flash
a better running game than they
have shown thus far.
For speedy, .tricky breakaway
threats, Shipkey has Mitchell, Koch,
Frank Forbes, and Lee Scott, while
Kandall "Buck" Fawcett and Doyle !
Cold iron will handle the down-the
middle assignments. Although full- I
backs are usually considered the
boys who get those precious one |
and two yards when the going is '
tough, Fawcett has shown that he i
is a scoring threat from anywhere i
in enemy territory, for against the !
Ucla frosh he broke away through
the center of the line and rambled j
150 yards to pay dirt.

lii yesterday's drill the frosh spent
a good deal of time polishing up
their defense which, Shipkey says,
has been somewhat neglected of
late, loday will find the yearlings 1
working on defense against Mo
desto attack formations, learning in- '
dividual and team defense assign
ments. There will also probably be
a short drill on kick-offs and place
kicks. The latter is an especially i
strong point in the Papoose attack
when Jim Ellis is in the game; Ellis !
has kicked five for five on con
version attempts.
PAPOOSES TO WIN
Despite Modesto's potentialities
and because of Stanford's flashy
passing attack, this writer picks the
Papooses to take tomorrow's game
by at least two touchdowns.
Coach Shipkey will probably start
the same eleven against the Pirates
as he did last week-end, which
means that Stanford will open with
Ellis and Bill Brubaker at ends,
Darwin Sceley and Jean Lamoure
at tackles, Kelly Ross and Bill Jos
lyn at guards, Loren LaPrade at
center, John Ken ward at quarter,
Mik-htll or Forbes at left half. Koch
at right half, and Fawcett at full.

Frosh will match Bob Mitchell and !
Bob Koch, both of whom have been |
very successful on the tossing end
of Stanford's aerial attack. Then,
too, the yearlings' unscored-on rec
ord speaks well for their pass de
fense. To offset their proven pass
ing offense, the frosh expect to flash
a better running game than they
have shown thus far.
For speedy, .tricky breakaway
threats, Shipkey has Mitchell, Koch,
Frank Forbes, and Lee Scott, while
Kandall "Buck" Fawcett and Doyle !
Cold iron will handle the down-the
middle assignments. Although full- I
backs are usually considered the
boys who get those precious one |
and two yards when the going is '
tough, Fawcett has shown that he i
is a scoring threat from anywhere i
in enemy territory, for against the !
Ucla frosh he broke away through
the center of the line and rambled j
150 yards to pay dirt.

lii yesterday's drill the frosh spent
a good deal of time polishing up
their defense which, Shipkey says,
has been somewhat neglected of
late, loday will find the yearlings 1
working on defense against Mo
desto attack formations, learning in- '
dividual and team defense assign
ments. There will also probably be
a short drill on kick-offs and place
kicks. The latter is an especially i
strong point in the Papoose attack
when Jim Ellis is in the game; Ellis !
has kicked five for five on con
version attempts.
PAPOOSES TO WIN
Despite Modesto's potentialities
and because of Stanford's flashy
passing attack, this writer picks the
Papooses to take tomorrow's game
by at least two touchdowns.
Coach Shipkey will probably start
the same eleven against the Pirates
as he did last week-end, which
means that Stanford will open with
Ellis and Bill Brubaker at ends,
Darwin Sceley and Jean Lamoure
at tackles, Kelly Ross and Bill Jos
lyn at guards, Loren LaPrade at
center, John Ken ward at quarter,
Mik-htll or Forbes at left half. Koch
at right half, and Fawcett at full.
After their third consecutive
victory of the season, a big squad
of I'apoose gridders will trot out
onto the turf in the Stanford Sta
dium tomorrow afternoon at 2
o'clock to meet Modesto Junior
College.
Should the frosh cop the contest,
they will have won half of their '
Raines for the season, for there are
only three more teams on the Pa- |
poose schedule—U.S.C. Frosh, Chaf- |
fey J.C., and California Frosh in !
that order. However, if the Pirates j
come through under game condi- j
tions with the potentialities they i
have shown in early season practice, j
Coach Harry Shipkey's charges will |
have a tough battle on their hands. j
The yearlings, having defeated ]
both San Mateo J. C. and U.C.L.A.
frosh, will probably be favored in j
tomorrow's clash, for the Modesto- j
ans have dropped two of their three
games thus far. Against Stanford, |
however, the Pirates will have the
use of two of their stars, Chuck Co- |
ker and Charles Labno, who have I
been on the sidelines with injuries. !
