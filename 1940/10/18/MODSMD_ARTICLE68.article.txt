SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 17 (UP).
—The real business of deciding a
Conference football champion and a
Rose Bowl representative starts to
morrow after three weeks of chiefly
j outside competition for the eight
Conference colleges.
The schedule-makers didn't know
j it when they set up four Confer-
I ence games for Oct. 19, involving
| every team, but tomorrow's pro
| gram actually may decide the 1940
; championship.
Unbeaten Stanford meets un
beaten Washington State at Pull
man; unbeaten Oregon State meets
Washington, unbeaten in the Con
! ference, at Seattle; unbeaten U.S.C.
meets twice-defeated Oregon at Los
j Angeles; and U.C.L.A., making its
j first Conference start after three
I outside defeats, lakes on California,
! U:;aten by Washington State, at
[ Berkeley.
RAGS TO RICIILS
If Stanford can stop a Washing
j ton State team that was strong
1 enough to tie U.S.C., the Stanford
j ites might acquire the momentum
needed to carry Clark Daniel
Shaughnfessy's "rags to riches" team
to the Rose Bowl. San Francisco
| Bay area sports writers are already
: thumping the drums for the team
most of the Western writers con
i signed to the cellar in August pre-
I views.

Similarly Oregon State, a power
ful team bucking a tough traveling ■
schedule, might get sufficient im
petus to go all the way by beating
Washington, the eleven everybody
picked in pre-season stories for the
11'40 title.
O.S.C. CRUCIAL
Those developments, illusory at
pi esent, would make the Oregon
State-Stanford game at Palo Alto
Nov. 16 the decisive battle.
Such prognosticating overlooks
U.S.C., champions for two years and
just getting into the stride which
carried the Jonesmen into the Rose
Bowl twice running. The Trojans
should have no trouble with Ore
gon tomorrow but their hardest road
—Washington, Stanford and pos
j sibly U.C.L.A.—lies ahead.
