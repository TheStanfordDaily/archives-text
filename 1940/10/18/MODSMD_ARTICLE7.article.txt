# Walker Compares 1940 Farm With Stanford of Last War
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Frank Pish Walker, Stanford's new comptroller, has returned to Stan
ford after 20 years to find the campus in much the same state of mind
as it was in his undergraduate days.
"I'm sorry that conscription is necessary," he said in an interview

Wednesday, "but I'm afraid it is." <
Mr. Walker was at Stanford from
1914 to 1016. Elected President of
the student body in the spring elec
tions of 1917, he never served in that
office; the war intervened.
SON CLASS OF '50'
"However, my son is 12 now. He'll
be Stanford, Class of '50," he
laughed. "That seems a long way
from the Class of '17."
After he was mustered out of the
Navy, he returned to California and
took a position with the investment
firm of Blyth-Witter & Co. in San
Francisco. "I swore that I'd come
back for good then, but in six months
they sent me to New York. I stayed
there for 20 years."
During that time he was vice
president and general partner with
Blyth-Witter, then was associated
with Blyth & Co., and finally with
Eastman, Dillon & Co. In 1936 he
was president of the New York
Bond Club. Experienced in invest
ment matters, Mr. Walker will act as
secretary of the investment commit
tee of the Board of Trustees. He was
a member of the Board of Trustees
for a little under a year.
'WONDERFUL' HERE
"It's hard to find words to tell
how I feel about coming back to
Stanford. 'Just wonderful' is about
the best I can do on short notice,"
he said. Mr. Walker plans to move
his family from Burlingame to the
Farm as soon as possible, but "there's
the matter of a lease to be ar
ranged."
In regard to the Stanford football
team, he commented that "Clark
Shaughnessy is doing a marvelous
iob." During his undergraduate
days, Mr. Walker was an ace rugby
player. This was before Stanford
switched to American football.
NO POLICY CHANGE
An answer to a question about any
changes in the Comptroller's policy,
he said, "My predecessors have the
place running so smoothly that
there seem to be no changes neces
sary. At any rate, the smartest thing
a new man on a job can do is just
sit still and listen hard."
Mr. Walker succeeds Almon E.
Roth, now president, of the San
Francisco Employers' Council. Dean
J. Hugh Jackson, of the Graduate
School of Business, has been serving
as acting comptroller.

player. This was before Stanford
switched to American football.
NO POLICY CHANGE
An answer to a question about any
changes in the Comptroller's policy,
he said, "My predecessors have the
place running so smoothly that
there seem to be no changes neces
sary. At any rate, the smartest thing
a new man on a job can do is just
sit still and listen hard."
Mr. Walker succeeds Almon E.
Roth, now president, of the San
Francisco Employers' Council. Dean
J. Hugh Jackson, of the Graduate
School of Business, has been serving
as acting comptroller.


FRANK F. WALKER
Frank Pish Walker, Stanford's new comptroller, has returned to Stan
ford after 20 years to find the campus in much the same state of mind
as it was in his undergraduate days.
"I'm sorry that conscription is necessary," he said in an interview

Wednesday, "but I'm afraid it is." <
Mr. Walker was at Stanford from
1914 to 1016. Elected President of
the student body in the spring elec
tions of 1917, he never served in that
office; the war intervened.
SON CLASS OF '50'
"However, my son is 12 now. He'll
be Stanford, Class of '50," he
laughed. "That seems a long way
from the Class of '17."
After he was mustered out of the
Navy, he returned to California and
took a position with the investment
firm of Blyth-Witter & Co. in San
Francisco. "I swore that I'd come
back for good then, but in six months
they sent me to New York. I stayed
there for 20 years."
During that time he was vice
president and general partner with
Blyth-Witter, then was associated
with Blyth & Co., and finally with
Eastman, Dillon & Co. In 1936 he
was president of the New York
Bond Club. Experienced in invest
ment matters, Mr. Walker will act as
secretary of the investment commit
tee of the Board of Trustees. He was
a member of the Board of Trustees
for a little under a year.
'WONDERFUL' HERE
"It's hard to find words to tell
how I feel about coming back to
Stanford. 'Just wonderful' is about
the best I can do on short notice,"
he said. Mr. Walker plans to move
his family from Burlingame to the
Farm as soon as possible, but "there's
the matter of a lease to be ar
ranged."
In regard to the Stanford football
team, he commented that "Clark
Shaughnessy is doing a marvelous
iob." During his undergraduate
days, Mr. Walker was an ace rugby
player. This was before Stanford
switched to American football.
