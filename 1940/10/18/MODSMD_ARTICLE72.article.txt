# Soccer Varsity Practices Attack
## 
### 
The varsity soccer men ran ;
through a light scrimmage yester
l day afternoon, and then laid off for
| the week. The scheduled chalk talk
! lor this afternoon was called off be
j cnuse of the freshman game with
: Pescadero.
No game v/as scheduled for this
week-end, so Coach Harry Maloney
spent the week working on funda
mentals and smoothing out the
rough spots in the attack. He was
very pleased with the team's show
ing in their first game against the
University of San Francisco, espe*
daily with the work of several
| promising sophomores.
The varsity's next game is against
; San Francisco State College in San
i Francisco, Oct. 26.

The historic first football game
j between California and Stanford
; was played on the Haight Street
grounds in San Francisco in 1892.
The final score of 14 to 10 was a
Stanford victory fairly earned.
