# Solution to a Problem
## 
### 
FiCOTBALL season is three big strides toward
December . . . it's about time for that knotty
little question to pop up again.
"Just a second, buddy, is this your student
body card?"
Associated Students and the various organs
which comprise the entity are always faced with
their load of problems. Some are surprise brain
teasers which are important only for the mo
ment; others, like the Cardinals investigation,
appear each year on approximate schedule. Of
these latter none can be more easily time-tabled
than the mystery of the little student body card.
Wooed in the interests of the Administration,
the B.A.C. and the student body, the little paste
board rectangle has been pushed and pum
meled about from one major sport season to
another. Deprecatingly tossed into wallet or
handbag on Reg day as a relatively insignificant
return for tuition investments, the student body
card assumes vastly greater importance when
the season is under way.

The Administration views these little cards as
non-transferable. They represent the privileges
of membership in the University family for the
owner of the card . . . and for him alone.

The B.A.C. is here for business. The intense
responsibility of keeping Stanford's sport pa
rade running is a business man's job. Not un
naturally they see the entrance of an outsider
into a Stanford game through the medium of a
student body card as a loss of tangible gate
receipts.
The 8.A.C., like other business organizations,
views expenditures with alarm. For this reason
the practice of putting each student's photo
graph on his student body card has never
been adopted here as it has at neighboring uni
versities. Yet the voice of the B.A.C. is loudest
in the condemnation of loaning the little paste
boards.
The back of the student body card is used to
disseminate information on the privileges and
responsibility of membership in the University.
A narrow margin of blank card surrounds this
message.
Should this information be condensed, or
should it begin higher on the card, room would
be left for a brief description of each registrant.
A small form would allow for information as to
height, weight, color of hair, color of eyes, and
other pertinent data. This form would be cor
rectly checked by the official who stamps your
student body cards.

No greater systematic check-up of card-hold
ers at student functions would be made than at
present. But Stanford students would be saved
the indignation felt at one of last year's off
campus games, where even the Bawlout was
resorted to as a test of studenthood.
And the idea won't cost much money either.

the B.A.C. and the student body, the little paste
board rectangle has been pushed and pum
meled about from one major sport season to
another. Deprecatingly tossed into wallet or
handbag on Reg day as a relatively insignificant
return for tuition investments, the student body
card assumes vastly greater importance when
the season is under way.

The Administration views these little cards as
non-transferable. They represent the privileges
of membership in the University family for the
owner of the card . . . and for him alone.

The B.A.C. is here for business. The intense
responsibility of keeping Stanford's sport pa
rade running is a business man's job. Not un
naturally they see the entrance of an outsider
into a Stanford game through the medium of a
student body card as a loss of tangible gate
receipts.
The 8.A.C., like other business organizations,
views expenditures with alarm. For this reason
the practice of putting each student's photo
graph on his student body card has never
been adopted here as it has at neighboring uni
versities. Yet the voice of the B.A.C. is loudest
in the condemnation of loaning the little paste
boards.
The back of the student body card is used to
disseminate information on the privileges and
responsibility of membership in the University.
A narrow margin of blank card surrounds this
message.
Should this information be condensed, or
should it begin higher on the card, room would
be left for a brief description of each registrant.
A small form would allow for information as to
height, weight, color of hair, color of eyes, and
other pertinent data. This form would be cor
rectly checked by the official who stamps your
student body cards.

No greater systematic check-up of card-hold
ers at student functions would be made than at
present. But Stanford students would be saved
the indignation felt at one of last year's off
campus games, where even the Bawlout was
resorted to as a test of studenthood.
And the idea won't cost much money either.

FiCOTBALL season is three big strides toward
December . . . it's about time for that knotty
little question to pop up again.
"Just a second, buddy, is this your student
body card?"
Associated Students and the various organs
which comprise the entity are always faced with
their load of problems. Some are surprise brain
teasers which are important only for the mo
ment; others, like the Cardinals investigation,
appear each year on approximate schedule. Of
these latter none can be more easily time-tabled
than the mystery of the little student body card.
