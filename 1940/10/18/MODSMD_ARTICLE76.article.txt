# Under Consideration

THE DAILY, so far, has called its shots on I
Cardinals. The most satisfying part of this
particular campaign has been the spirit of co
operation with which it has been received.
Chairman Ned Pugh and A.S.S.U. President
Bruce Jessup have both agreed to the evils of
a self-perpetuating body and immediately have
shown every willingness to devise a more
workable method.
Cardinals appointed a competent subcom- !
mittee composed of Stun Glikbarg and Betty
Moses; and Excommittee named Ross Anderson
and Anne Townsend to investigate the situa
tion. From their discussion this week-end
should come some concrete proposal next Tues- j
day night to revamp the tricky by-law clause j

that makes Cardinals so potentially powerful
and to re-map the inefficient method of appoint
ment.
Once these two prime evils are removed,
Cardinals will be free from criticism on any
score. No one for a moment has considered
abolishing Cardinals. It fills too important a
position in the A.S.S.U. system to be done away
with. The work that it undertakes could not be
handled by any other arrangement. And, as
soon as Cardinals "cleans house," constitu
tionally, it will be strengthened and fit to con
tinue its service to Stanford.
There have been a number of schemes ad
vanced by Ex Committee and interested Car
dinals members to correct the appointment
racket.
These include such plans as authorizing Ex
com and Cardinals to hold a joint meeting and
pick membership; allowing each campus living
group to submit one member's name for con
sideration by Excom which, in turn, would se
lect the most eligible; permitting Cardinals to
pick half its membership, Excom the other half.
These and other ideas will be shuffled about
by the two sub-committees. What results from
their work should be a practical solution to the
problem.
