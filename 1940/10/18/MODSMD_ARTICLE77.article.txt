# BULL SESSION
## SOMEWHERE OVER THE RAINBOW 
### BUD AMES 
r jpHIS is sort of going over into the sports field, which
is not in the Bull Session vein, but after all the
lean gridiron years here at ye olde Farm, good news
is always welcome news no matter where you get it.
The glad tidings come from a newspaper article
just published in the Santa Barbara News-Press.
Santa Barbara, in case you didn't know, is just a
pleasant drive from the Rose Bowl. To make it more
graphic, if all the members on the S. C. football squad
were cooled and then laid end to end, they would
just reach from the Stanford Stadium to Santa Bar
bara—and probably back.
Well, the News-Press spread their sport page with
a four-column headline reading—and in large, large
type too—"Stanford Is Hottest Team on West Coast
with Three Straight Wins."
The whole thing would have been pretty mislead
ing without those last four words. Either way, they're
correct.

YV/HAT they mean is that Stanford has a cracker
jack football squad. That's no news to you, but
when somebody else says it from way down in Santa
Barbara (the land of oranges, sunshine, and Granny
Landsdale), well then it means something.
And not only that, they even say that our Indians
are touted as number one shots to walk off with the
Conference title. And it doesn't stop there. Messes
and messes of people have gone overboard and pickcd
us for the top spot when all the confusion is over
and the dead players have been given a decent burial.
Coach Tex Oliver of Oregon (those nifty green
things we knocked off a couple of weeks ago) said
the same thing, only with a few less smiles. And he
should know what he's talking about. It went, "Until
I see a better one, Stanford is the best team on the
coast."
He won't.

T HE
question now arises that now that we've got
a football squad arc we going to keep 'em? What
about the draft? You can save your breath, because
from that angle Stanford is about the safest school on
the Coast. Remember that well over 15 of our most
promising players are sophomores. You can almost,
count on the fingers of one hand the number of varsity
gridders who had to register last Wednesday for the
draft. It's the youngest squad on the Coast.
So we've won our game with Uncle Sam.
And still more undiscovered football talent is being
discovered every day; the possible loss of a couple of
players wouldn't hurt anybody much—except the fel
lows who got drafted. If Petrovich can do it, so can
they.
So it's hold tight and keep your fingers crossed.
The distance from here to the Rose Bowl is exactly
390 miles by car, and a round-trip train ticket, costs
$10.60.
How do you think Texas A. and M. will look?
