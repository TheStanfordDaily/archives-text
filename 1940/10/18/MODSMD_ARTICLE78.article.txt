# CAMPUS OPINION
## THOSE THREE-THIRTIES? 
### 
r pIE EDITOR, SIR:
We laughed when they called it a "sophomore
slump." Things like that don't happen to us, we said.
Oh. no! In the three weeks we have been at Lagunita
we have had between us enough phone calls to count
on one hand. Maybe it's just that those buzzers at
Roble were in better working order—or maybe the
ratio has dropped to only 2 to 1.
We don't mind sitting home on ordinary nights—
that is if nothing better turns up. But what we're
really worried about is the night when we have
those automatic three-thirties. What the hell arc we
going to do with those 3:3o's? If there are two Stanford
(or Cal) men who would be interested in taking out a
couple of nice (at least we think so) girls on Big
Game Night let them address their letters to Box 91!)
or Box 2034.
A Couple of Sophomore Has-Becns
P.S. No, we won't send pictures—let them come see
for themselves.
