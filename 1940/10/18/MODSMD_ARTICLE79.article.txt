r rilE EDITOR, SIR:
We would like to bring to your attention a cer
tain paragraph found on page 57 of the Stanford Hand
book and listed under the section, TRADITIONS. Il
is entitled. "Rides to Paly," and reads, "Diagonally
across from the History Corner, at the campus end
of Palm Drive, and at the Roos Bros, corner in Pah)
Alto, car-less Farm men and women await the aid
of their more fortunate classmates. Tradition rules that
those with cars pick up those without."
It seems that there are many who either do not
know of this tradition or else choose to overlook it as
we have "awaited our more fortunate classmates"
sometimes for more than half an hour while they
drove gaily by in their empty cars to and from the
campus. It seems that the WOMEN are the greatest
offenders, as they NEVER offer to pick any of us up
and give us a lift. They are quite happy when we
give them a lift when we are driving and they also
like our company on dates. Why. then, do they choose
to pass us up when we are walking? From where we
stand it looks like they think they are just a little too
good for us. Incidentally, just because the men have
dates is no reason why they can't utilize their back
scats (if any) to give lis a short lift—we promise not
to interfere.
