XIAPOLEON threatened an inva
sion of the British Isles, but
when the plan seemed about to fail
he turned to the South and the East.
Hitler, too, has threatened an in
vasion of the British Isles and now
he turns to the South and the East.
One observer drew this parallel
during the past week-end as re
ports from Southeastern Europe in
dicated that Hitler was preparing
further thrusts into the Balkan re
gion.
Although neither Yugoslavia nor
Bulgaria has yet felt the tread of
Hitler's marching troops, both of
these countries during the past few
days have fallen into the Axis orbit.
Yugoslavia, geographically all but
swallowed in the Axis' "New Eu
rope," succumbed to German de
mands for trade agreements that
virtually subjugate her life to the
needs of Nazi economy. Yugoslavia
agreed to restrict industrial produc
tion and increase agricultural output
to help feed the Reich and to ex
port all surpluses to Germany.

Bulgaria has undergone much the
same fate, but with perhaps less re
sistance. The trade pact in Bul
garia may have been welcomed, for
Bulgaria has suffered even more se
verely than other Balkan states
from the economic depression that
has existed since the trade barriers
set. up by World War I peace treaties
chopped up the Balkan region. The
new pact covers all trade between
Bulgaria and Norway, Holland,
Belgium ,and Poland.
Only two countries—Greece and
Turkey — stand on the map be
tween Nazi-held or dominated
lands and the rich oil region of
the Near East. But it may be as
sumed that engulfing Greece and
Turkey will be more of a task
than Hitler's other conquests in
the Balkans. Russia may not con
sent to German possession of the
narrow straits that connect the
Mediterranean with the Black
Sea.
Because the observer hoped that
Britain would avert an invasion now
as it did when Napoleon turned to
the South and East, the parallel be
tween Hitler and Napoleon may be
wish-thinking. This was his first
hope, possibly, but some might point
out, that they would like to see the
parallel extended even further. Na
poleon's first important setback was
su fie red at the hands of the Rus
sians; Hitler's first important set
back, it is hoped, will come like
wise at the hands of the Russians.

,JUT during the past few days
there have been indi
cations that this last parallel will
never become fact and a German-
Russian agreement concerning the
Balkans seems about to break.
Correspondents of the leading
American press associations in Lon
don reported that the British gov
ernment had all but given up hope
of weaning Russia away from her
co-operation with the Axis powers.
What Russia would get for her
guarantee not to intervene in behalf
of Turkey, no one was willing to
predict. But military experts are
agreed that the long-range strategy
of the Axis at present is to avoid a
clash with Russia at any cost in
order to concentrate on a pincer
movement around Egypt and the
Suez Canal.
Newspapers in Istanbul have em
phasized continually the possibility
of a Russo-German clash, should the
Nazis attempt to take the straits; but
in some quarters this stand was in
terpreted as an indication that Rus
sia had already renounced Turkey.
Although all guesses on Hitler's
plans are hazardous, one rumor cir
culating in Vichy seemed reasonable
after reviewing reports from the
Balkans, From the provisional
French capital came the report, that
Hitler had offered Russia domina
tion of European .Turkey and con
trol of the Dardanelles in exchange
for Russian agreement to Germany's
southeastern push.
This rumor seemed more likely
than the hoped-for parallel that one
observer drew between the cam
paigns of Hitler and Napoleon.
