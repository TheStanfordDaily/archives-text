condensing and adapting 40,000
words of copy wired in from all
parts of the world to the few pages
of actual script necessary for the 15-

Miller as editor is faced with the
task of selecting and evaluating the
news as well as preparing it for

information on the problems of the
sprawling press services in ferreting
out and transmitting news from all
parts of the world. The entire field
of radio news presentation and re
