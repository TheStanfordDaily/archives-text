# Daily Sponsors Quizzes
## Farm to Study Colorful 50-year History 
### 
Next year Stanford will celebrate
its fiftieth anniversary. So that the
present generation of Farm under
graduates may know a little more
about their university, its founding,
development, and traditions, The
Stanford Daily is sponsoring a con
test which it feels will fulfill this
aim.
Over a period of five weeks, The
Daily will run a series of short, bi
weekly quizzes, the first of which is
scheduled to appear in the Oct. 28
edition of The Daily. These ques
tionnaires will consist of nine fac
tual, objective questions, and one
essay, subjective question based on
various phases of past or present
Stanford life.
A winner will be announced each
week and the five finalists will com
pete for the prizes at an all-Univer
sity assembly to be held early in
winter quarter. This final competi
tion will be held in the form of an
"Information Please," and the win
ner will receive a first prize of $75.
The second prize is $25.
The questions will be printed on
Monday and Wednesday of each
week; four objective questions on
Monday, and four objective and one
essay question on Wednesday. The
answers must be in on the Friday
of the week they appear, and they

are to be placed in a special box
in the Cellar.
A board of judges including Dr.
George Culver, dean of men, emeri
tus; Bruce Jessup, A.S.S.U. presi
dent.; Anne Townsend, A.S.S.U. vice
president; Dwight Hutchinson, edi
tor of The Stanford Daily; and Jean
Nowcll, Daily feature editor, will
read the answers and judge them on
a basis of five points per objective
question, and one to ten points per
essay question.
The decision of the judges will be
final and the name of the week's
winner will be announced in the
following Monday's Daily along with
the answers to the questions. Win
ners will be considered ineligible for
further competition until the finals.
The contest is open to all students
registered in the University except
members of the Daily staff.
The contest is an integral part of
a wide-scale program now being
planned to celebrate the Farm's
birthday, and has been mapped out
with the specific intention of stimu
lating interest in Stanford's history.
Formal rules and directions will
appear in later issues of the Daily
along with a bibliography which will
list various books containing infor
mation which should prove helpful
in answering the questions.
