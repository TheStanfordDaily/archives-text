# Who Said Our 'White Ghosts' Were Lucky?
## Daily Correspondent Flies to Pullman For Color Story

Managing Editor, Stanford Daily
And another '"Little White Ghost"
had the ball and romped over for a
touchdown . . . that is, after the
first three minutes and forty-five
seconds.
But up until the time when the
first Stanford touchdown was made
and Albert had kicked the first
conversion, every loyal Stanford
ite had a real case of jitters.
W.S.C.'s first score happened too
fast, came too easily for them.
Thus before a record crowd of
24,000 which filhcd the 25,000 ca
pacity wooden bowl almost to the
overflowing point, Stanford with
their spectacular white suits of air
plane cloth showed with a final tally
of 26 to 14 that they were more than
just the lucky team that Coach
Shaughnessy has been speaking of
at the Monday coaches' luncheons in
the city.
GONZAGA BAND PLAYS
In spite of the fact that Stanford
hadn't bothered to send up any
cheer leader, the Stanford enthu
siasts showed a great deal of spiirit
and a considerable bit of lung ca
pacity. But Stanford was not with
out music; for the Gonzaga band
came down from Spokane and
turned in a good performance. They
played "Come Join the Band" at the
right times just like our own boys.
Washington State demonstrated
that, they were real hosts and true
sportsmen when they cheered for
the beautiful playing of the Stanford
White Ghosts — not "Flour Mill
Workers" for I doubt if "Flour Mill
Workers" could play so fine a game
of "Who's Got It. Now?" or "Where
Did It Go from the Center?"
The W.S.C. rooters however, did,
put on a half-time program that
would smother most of U.S.C.'s un
der a blanket of "flour."
KIDNAP HERO PRESENTED
Cecil Wctsel, who captured the
Marc de Tristan kidnapper, was
presented by Dr. E. O. Holland,
president of the college. Wetsel,
who was called "Hippo" in his col
lege days of 1919 to 1923, was the
hero of the home-coming celebra
tion.
The W.S.C. band and glee club
put on a very inspiring demonstra
tion with the band all in dark blue
with red military capes and the
blue club all in white. They formed
the letter "S" and then serenaded
the Stanford stands with "Sons of
the Stanford Red," while five well
trained and beautiful majorettes
Iwirled their batons and a black and
white collie sat on his haunches and
surveyed the whole procedure with
great interest.

And another '"Little White Ghost"
had the ball and romped over for a
touchdown . . . that is, after the
first three minutes and forty-five
seconds.
But up until the time when the
first Stanford touchdown was made
and Albert had kicked the first
conversion, every loyal Stanford
ite had a real case of jitters.
W.S.C.'s first score happened too
fast, came too easily for them.
Thus before a record crowd of
24,000 which filhcd the 25,000 ca
pacity wooden bowl almost to the
overflowing point, Stanford with
their spectacular white suits of air
plane cloth showed with a final tally
of 26 to 14 that they were more than
just the lucky team that Coach
Shaughnessy has been speaking of
at the Monday coaches' luncheons in
the city.
GONZAGA BAND PLAYS
In spite of the fact that Stanford
hadn't bothered to send up any
cheer leader, the Stanford enthu
siasts showed a great deal of spiirit
and a considerable bit of lung ca
pacity. But Stanford was not with
out music; for the Gonzaga band
came down from Spokane and
turned in a good performance. They
played "Come Join the Band" at the
right times just like our own boys.
Washington State demonstrated
that, they were real hosts and true
sportsmen when they cheered for
the beautiful playing of the Stanford
White Ghosts — not "Flour Mill
Workers" for I doubt if "Flour Mill
Workers" could play so fine a game
of "Who's Got It. Now?" or "Where
Did It Go from the Center?"
The W.S.C. rooters however, did,
put on a half-time program that
would smother most of U.S.C.'s un
der a blanket of "flour."
KIDNAP HERO PRESENTED
Cecil Wctsel, who captured the
Marc de Tristan kidnapper, was
presented by Dr. E. O. Holland,
president of the college. Wetsel,
who was called "Hippo" in his col
lege days of 1919 to 1923, was the
hero of the home-coming celebra
tion.
The W.S.C. band and glee club
put on a very inspiring demonstra
tion with the band all in dark blue
with red military capes and the
blue club all in white. They formed
the letter "S" and then serenaded
the Stanford stands with "Sons of
the Stanford Red," while five well
trained and beautiful majorettes
Iwirled their batons and a black and
white collie sat on his haunches and
surveyed the whole procedure with
great interest.
