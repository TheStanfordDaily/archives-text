# Italy Bombs American Oil In Near East
## Official Duce Paper Warns Great Britain To Beware of U.S. 
### 
ROME. Oct. 20 (UP).—Ameri
can-owned oil refineries on Bah
rein Island tonight were reported
set afire by Italian warplanes, re
fueling from submarine "under
sea tankers" and carrying the war
into the Persian Gulf in the long
est bombing flight ever under
taken.
The Fascist high command said
the Italian heavy bombers, flying
2800 miles to reach their objectives,
started "huge fires" at refineries and
stores on the 27-mile-long island
which is a British possession but
whose oil industry is entirely Amer
ican-owned.
STRATOSPHERE FLIGHT
The attack was staged Saturday
night, the high command's com
munique said, and informed quar
ters said they believed the squadron
of heavy bombers had flown through
the sub-stratosphere most of the dis
tance, alighting only to refuel from
submarines.
Meanwhile, Britain was warned
to sue for peace immediately be
fore the United States steps into
the war and "takes over control
of England."
Foreign Minister Count Galeazzo
Ciano's Leghorn newspaper II
Telegrafo said that the United
States is likely to enter the war
in the spring on Britain's side to
"deliver a last blow to British in
dependence and make the island
a territory of the union."
The first aerial bombardment of
the Persian Gulf, gateway to the
vital oil fields toward which the
Italo-German military operations in
the Near East are spearheaded, was
hailed by the Rome radio tonight as
establishing a world's Jong distance
bombing record.
Newly developed "undersea tank
ers"—big U-boats of 3000 to 5000-ton
displacement — were said to have
been employed in the refueling op
erations.
NEW REFUELING SYSTEM
This new type refueling, it was
said, can be carried out in 20 min
utes under an Italian plan synchro
nizing planes and submarines. En
route to Bahrein the refueling was
presumed to have occurred in the
eastern Mediterranean and on the
return trip, somewhere in the Ara
bian Sea.
(The Bahrein Petroleum Com
pany, Ltd., which holds the oil con
cession on the Persian Gulf island,
is owned equally by the Texas Com
pany and Standard Oil of California.
The concession originally was held
by British operators.)
(The Bahrein refineries have had
a production of about 30,000 barrels
a day for the past two years and
recently much of this oil has been
shipped to Japan and countries of
the Near East.)
