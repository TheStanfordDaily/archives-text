# Cards Send Cougar Air Attack Into Tailspin with 26-14 Victory; Indians Score Twice on Passes
## Brilliant Signal Calling by Albert, Flashy Play of Kmetovic, Standlee Feature High Scoring Duel in North 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Though Stanford's still unbeaten and untied football team bad hun
dreds of its radio listening Farm faas worried to death for a while, i<
proved again that it is eapablc Rose Bowl material by winning its second
straight conference game 26-14 Saturday against Washington State College.
In a wild, high scoring duel the Cards struck with lightning-like speed,

wice through the air and twice
dong the ground to overcome an
imposing 7-point Cougar lead.
W.S.C.'s final score came in the
closing minutes of the game against
lie Indian second-stringers and whs
smart consolation for the thoroughly
fDeaten northerners.
SMART QUARTERBACKING
It was the smart quarterbackmg
md left-handed precision passing of
Frankie Albert and the brilliant
running of "Skeeter Peter" Kmetovic
that tamed the Cougars. On the
other hand, the Staters' Billy Sewell
lived up to all advance notices and
sparked a Cougar offense which
rolled up plenty of yardage.
Though Washington State had sta
tistical advantage of 35 first downs
to 14 and a net gain of yardage only
slightly smaller than the Indian
total, the Cards won their ball game
decisively because they concen
trated their power on one short and
three long unstoppable touchdown
marches.
VV.S.C. SCORES FIRST
Evidently still getting the feel of
their fancy, new, all white traveling
suits, the Cards were definitely nap
ping during the first three or four
minutes of the ball game. For W.S.C.
had 7 points on the score board on a
passing and running 68-yard drive
before they had even soiled their
pretty new uniforms.
Proving again that they are at. best,
under pressure, Coach Clark
Shaughnessy's gridders found them
selves trailing for the first time this
year and gathered for a breath-tak
ing comeback.
Back they came soon after the
Cougar score for their first tour to
pay dirt—a 62-yarder. Albert, inter
cepted one of Sewell's heretofore
successful passes on the Stanford 38
and the stage was set. Kmetovic
rolled through left tackle for a mere
52 yards to the Cougar 10 on the
prettiest run of the day.
Giant Norm Standlee, whom
Shaughnessy kept under wraps for
a great, part of the game, carried the
remaining 10 yards on a weak side
play and crossed the goal without
being touched. Albert converted and
the Cards had erased the northern
ers' lead in three lightning strokes.
TOUCHDOWN MARCH
But they didn't stop there. Another
thrust carried all of 83 yards to a
touchdown in the second period.
This journey featured the running
of the unstoppable Kmetovic arid
shifty little A1 Cole. The pay-off
came on third down on the Staters'
26 with three yards to go for a new
set of downs when Albert, called the
unorthodox play for such a situa
tion—a pass.
It caught the Cougars unprepared
and Albert pitched to slippery Eii<
Armstrong in the end /.one for the
second Card score. Albert again
converted and Shaughnessy's outfit
was safely away to the fourth
straight victory.
73 YARDS IN FOUR PLAYS
The remaining two Indian touch
downs came close on the heels of
one another in the third quarter.
The first of these was another long
drive for 73 yards and the Reds,
dressed in white last. Saturday,
moved this distance in only four
