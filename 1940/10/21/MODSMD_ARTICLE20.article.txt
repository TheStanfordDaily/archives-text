# Cards Send Cougar Air Attack Into Tailspin with 26-14 Victory; Indians Score Twice on Passes
## Brilliant Signal Calling by Albert, Flashy Play of Kmetovic, Standlee Feature High Scoring Duel in North 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Though Stanford's still unbeaten and untied football team bad hun
dreds of its radio listening Farm faas worried to death for a while, i<
proved again that it is eapablc Rose Bowl material by winning its second
straight conference game 26-14 Saturday against Washington State College.
In a wild, high scoring duel the Cards struck with lightning-like speed,

wice through the air and twice
dong the ground to overcome an
imposing 7-point Cougar lead.
W.S.C.'s final score came in the
closing minutes of the game against
lie Indian second-stringers and whs
smart consolation for the thoroughly
fDeaten northerners.
SMART QUARTERBACKING
It was the smart quarterbackmg
md left-handed precision passing of
Frankie Albert and the brilliant
running of "Skeeter Peter" Kmetovic
that tamed the Cougars. On the
other hand, the Staters' Billy Sewell
lived up to all advance notices and
sparked a Cougar offense which
rolled up plenty of yardage.
Though Washington State had sta
tistical advantage of 35 first downs
to 14 and a net gain of yardage only
slightly smaller than the Indian
total, the Cards won their ball game
decisively because they concen
trated their power on one short and
three long unstoppable touchdown
marches.
VV.S.C. SCORES FIRST
Evidently still getting the feel of
their fancy, new, all white traveling
suits, the Cards were definitely nap
ping during the first three or four
minutes of the ball game. For W.S.C.
had 7 points on the score board on a
passing and running 68-yard drive
before they had even soiled their
pretty new uniforms.
Proving again that they are at. best,
under pressure, Coach Clark
Shaughnessy's gridders found them
selves trailing for the first time this
year and gathered for a breath-tak
ing comeback.
Back they came soon after the
Cougar score for their first tour to
pay dirt—a 62-yarder. Albert, inter
cepted one of Sewell's heretofore
successful passes on the Stanford 38
and the stage was set. Kmetovic
rolled through left tackle for a mere
52 yards to the Cougar 10 on the
prettiest run of the day.
Giant Norm Standlee, whom
Shaughnessy kept under wraps for
a great, part of the game, carried the
remaining 10 yards on a weak side
play and crossed the goal without
being touched. Albert converted and
the Cards had erased the northern
ers' lead in three lightning strokes.
TOUCHDOWN MARCH
But they didn't stop there. Another
thrust carried all of 83 yards to a
touchdown in the second period.
This journey featured the running
of the unstoppable Kmetovic arid
shifty little A1 Cole. The pay-off
came on third down on the Staters'
26 with three yards to go for a new
set of downs when Albert, called the
unorthodox play for such a situa
tion—a pass.
It caught the Cougars unprepared
and Albert pitched to slippery Eii<
Armstrong in the end /.one for the
second Card score. Albert again
converted and Shaughnessy's outfit
was safely away to the fourth
straight victory.
73 YARDS IN FOUR PLAYS
The remaining two Indian touch
downs came close on the heels of
one another in the third quarter.
The first of these was another long
drive for 73 yards and the Reds,
dressed in white last. Saturday,
moved this distance in only four
plays, one play by each backfield
man.
Hugh Gallameau hit tackle for 4
yards to the Cards' own 31. Kmeto
vic was away again and this time
for 11 yardf>. Next it was Standlee
and he steamed 30 more yards down
the middle of the field to Washing
ton State's 33.
And now it was Albert's turn to
finish what his three teammates had
started. Frankie faded to pass and
hit Freddie Meyer directly on the
goal line with another beautiful
touchdown pass.
COUGAR FUMBLE HELPS
As if the havoc they had wrought
so far wasn't humiliating enough to
the Cougars before the eyes of their
large home coming crowd, the still
unsatisfied Indians rudely grabbed
another touchdown in the next
three minutes.
Vic Lindskog, rugged Card cen
ter, caused and recovered a W.S.C.
fumble on the Cougar 30. It was
the first scoring opportunity that
had been given to the Indians as
more or less of a gift and they soon
capitalized on it.
Albert lateraled to Gallarneau
and Hugh stepped off half the dis
tance to the goal line. Kmetovic fol
lowed his running mate's example
on the next play and outsped a
horde of Cougar defenders to dive
into the end zone.
SEWELL'S PASSES CLICK
Thus ended scoring activities for
Stanford for the afternoon and the
remainder of the game saw Wash
ington State wear down and finally
break through the stubborn Card
second and third strings to get a

long denied touchdown. Sewell's
feared passes clicked again as they
had done on the first Cougar drive
and a battering fullback, Dick Ren
fro, provided the punch to carry over
the Card goal.
Except for the frightening early
minute barrage of passes and the
final touchdown march by the Stat
ers, Sewell's tosses were pretty well
stopped. Shaughnessy's ends chased
Sewell all over the lot on his pass
ing attempts and a six-man Card
backfield batted down most of the
aerials he got away.
The streamlined Indian coaching
staff saw fit to use a total of 35 of
its available 37 players and the great
lot of experience gained by many
second and third stringers is bound
to pay dividends later in the year
when the going gets tough.

This journey featured the running
of the unstoppable Kmetovic arid
shifty little A1 Cole. The pay-off
came on third down on the Staters'
26 with three yards to go for a new
set of downs when Albert, called the
unorthodox play for such a situa
tion—a pass.
It caught the Cougars unprepared
and Albert pitched to slippery Eii<
Armstrong in the end /.one for the
second Card score. Albert again
converted and Shaughnessy's outfit
was safely away to the fourth
straight victory.
73 YARDS IN FOUR PLAYS
The remaining two Indian touch
downs came close on the heels of
one another in the third quarter.
The first of these was another long
drive for 73 yards and the Reds,
dressed in white last. Saturday,
moved this distance in only four
plays, one play by each backfield
man.
Hugh Gallameau hit tackle for 4
yards to the Cards' own 31. Kmeto
vic was away again and this time
for 11 yardf>. Next it was Standlee
and he steamed 30 more yards down
the middle of the field to Washing
ton State's 33.
And now it was Albert's turn to
finish what his three teammates had
started. Frankie faded to pass and
hit Freddie Meyer directly on the
goal line with another beautiful
touchdown pass.
COUGAR FUMBLE HELPS
As if the havoc they had wrought
so far wasn't humiliating enough to
the Cougars before the eyes of their
large home coming crowd, the still
unsatisfied Indians rudely grabbed
another touchdown in the next
three minutes.
Vic Lindskog, rugged Card cen
ter, caused and recovered a W.S.C.
fumble on the Cougar 30. It was
the first scoring opportunity that
had been given to the Indians as
more or less of a gift and they soon
capitalized on it.
Albert lateraled to Gallarneau
and Hugh stepped off half the dis
tance to the goal line. Kmetovic fol
lowed his running mate's example
on the next play and outsped a
horde of Cougar defenders to dive
into the end zone.
SEWELL'S PASSES CLICK
Thus ended scoring activities for
Stanford for the afternoon and the
remainder of the game saw Wash
ington State wear down and finally
break through the stubborn Card
second and third strings to get a

long denied touchdown. Sewell's
feared passes clicked again as they
had done on the first Cougar drive
and a battering fullback, Dick Ren
fro, provided the punch to carry over
the Card goal.
Except for the frightening early
minute barrage of passes and the
final touchdown march by the Stat
ers, Sewell's tosses were pretty well
stopped. Shaughnessy's ends chased
Sewell all over the lot on his pass
ing attempts and a six-man Card
backfield batted down most of the
aerials he got away.
The streamlined Indian coaching
staff saw fit to use a total of 35 of
its available 37 players and the great
lot of experience gained by many
second and third stringers is bound
to pay dividends later in the year
when the going gets tough.
Though Stanford's still unbeaten and untied football team bad hun
dreds of its radio listening Farm faas worried to death for a while, i<
proved again that it is eapablc Rose Bowl material by winning its second
straight conference game 26-14 Saturday against Washington State College.
In a wild, high scoring duel the Cards struck with lightning-like speed,

wice through the air and twice
dong the ground to overcome an
imposing 7-point Cougar lead.
W.S.C.'s final score came in the
closing minutes of the game against
lie Indian second-stringers and whs
smart consolation for the thoroughly
fDeaten northerners.
SMART QUARTERBACKING
It was the smart quarterbackmg
md left-handed precision passing of
Frankie Albert and the brilliant
running of "Skeeter Peter" Kmetovic
that tamed the Cougars. On the
other hand, the Staters' Billy Sewell
lived up to all advance notices and
sparked a Cougar offense which
rolled up plenty of yardage.
Though Washington State had sta
tistical advantage of 35 first downs
to 14 and a net gain of yardage only
slightly smaller than the Indian
total, the Cards won their ball game
decisively because they concen
trated their power on one short and
three long unstoppable touchdown
marches.
VV.S.C. SCORES FIRST
Evidently still getting the feel of
their fancy, new, all white traveling
suits, the Cards were definitely nap
ping during the first three or four
minutes of the ball game. For W.S.C.
had 7 points on the score board on a
passing and running 68-yard drive
before they had even soiled their
pretty new uniforms.
Proving again that they are at. best,
under pressure, Coach Clark
Shaughnessy's gridders found them
selves trailing for the first time this
year and gathered for a breath-tak
ing comeback.
Back they came soon after the
Cougar score for their first tour to
pay dirt—a 62-yarder. Albert, inter
cepted one of Sewell's heretofore
successful passes on the Stanford 38
and the stage was set. Kmetovic
rolled through left tackle for a mere
52 yards to the Cougar 10 on the
prettiest run of the day.
Giant Norm Standlee, whom
Shaughnessy kept under wraps for
a great, part of the game, carried the
remaining 10 yards on a weak side
play and crossed the goal without
being touched. Albert converted and
the Cards had erased the northern
ers' lead in three lightning strokes.

backfield batted down most of the
aerials he got away.
The streamlined Indian coaching
staff saw fit to use a total of 35 of
its available 37 players and the great
lot of experience gained by many
second and third stringers is bound
to pay dividends later in the year
when the going gets tough.
Though Stanford's still unbeaten and untied football team bad hun
dreds of its radio listening Farm faas worried to death for a while, i<
proved again that it is eapablc Rose Bowl material by winning its second
straight conference game 26-14 Saturday against Washington State College.
In a wild, high scoring duel the Cards struck with lightning-like speed,

wice through the air and twice
dong the ground to overcome an
imposing 7-point Cougar lead.
W.S.C.'s final score came in the
closing minutes of the game against
lie Indian second-stringers and whs
smart consolation for the thoroughly
fDeaten northerners.
SMART QUARTERBACKING
It was the smart quarterbackmg
md left-handed precision passing of
Frankie Albert and the brilliant
running of "Skeeter Peter" Kmetovic
that tamed the Cougars. On the
other hand, the Staters' Billy Sewell
lived up to all advance notices and
sparked a Cougar offense which
rolled up plenty of yardage.
Though Washington State had sta
tistical advantage of 35 first downs
to 14 and a net gain of yardage only
slightly smaller than the Indian
total, the Cards won their ball game
decisively because they concen
trated their power on one short and
three long unstoppable touchdown
marches.
VV.S.C. SCORES FIRST
Evidently still getting the feel of
their fancy, new, all white traveling
suits, the Cards were definitely nap
ping during the first three or four
minutes of the ball game. For W.S.C.
had 7 points on the score board on a
passing and running 68-yard drive
before they had even soiled their
pretty new uniforms.
Proving again that they are at. best,
under pressure, Coach Clark
Shaughnessy's gridders found them
selves trailing for the first time this
year and gathered for a breath-tak
ing comeback.
Back they came soon after the
Cougar score for their first tour to
pay dirt—a 62-yarder. Albert, inter
cepted one of Sewell's heretofore
successful passes on the Stanford 38
and the stage was set. Kmetovic
rolled through left tackle for a mere
52 yards to the Cougar 10 on the
prettiest run of the day.
Giant Norm Standlee, whom
Shaughnessy kept under wraps for
a great, part of the game, carried the
remaining 10 yards on a weak side
play and crossed the goal without
being touched. Albert converted and
the Cards had erased the northern
ers' lead in three lightning strokes.
TOUCHDOWN MARCH
But they didn't stop there. Another
thrust carried all of 83 yards to a
touchdown in the second period.
This journey featured the running
of the unstoppable Kmetovic arid
shifty little A1 Cole. The pay-off
came on third down on the Staters'
26 with three yards to go for a new
set of downs when Albert, called the
unorthodox play for such a situa
tion—a pass.
It caught the Cougars unprepared
and Albert pitched to slippery Eii<
Armstrong in the end /.one for the
second Card score. Albert again
converted and Shaughnessy's outfit
was safely away to the fourth
straight victory.
73 YARDS IN FOUR PLAYS
The remaining two Indian touch
downs came close on the heels of
one another in the third quarter.
The first of these was another long
drive for 73 yards and the Reds,
dressed in white last. Saturday,
moved this distance in only four
plays, one play by each backfield
man.
Hugh Gallameau hit tackle for 4
yards to the Cards' own 31. Kmeto
vic was away again and this time
for 11 yardf>. Next it was Standlee
and he steamed 30 more yards down
the middle of the field to Washing
ton State's 33.
And now it was Albert's turn to
finish what his three teammates had
started. Frankie faded to pass and
hit Freddie Meyer directly on the
goal line with another beautiful
touchdown pass.
COUGAR FUMBLE HELPS
As if the havoc they had wrought
so far wasn't humiliating enough to
the Cougars before the eyes of their
large home coming crowd, the still
unsatisfied Indians rudely grabbed
another touchdown in the next
three minutes.
Vic Lindskog, rugged Card cen
ter, caused and recovered a W.S.C.
fumble on the Cougar 30. It was
the first scoring opportunity that
had been given to the Indians as
more or less of a gift and they soon
capitalized on it.
Albert lateraled to Gallarneau
and Hugh stepped off half the dis
tance to the goal line. Kmetovic fol
lowed his running mate's example
on the next play and outsped a
horde of Cougar defenders to dive
into the end zone.
SEWELL'S PASSES CLICK
Thus ended scoring activities for
Stanford for the afternoon and the
remainder of the game saw Wash
ington State wear down and finally
break through the stubborn Card
second and third strings to get a

long denied touchdown. Sewell's
feared passes clicked again as they
had done on the first Cougar drive
and a battering fullback, Dick Ren
fro, provided the punch to carry over
the Card goal.
Except for the frightening early
minute barrage of passes and the
final touchdown march by the Stat
ers, Sewell's tosses were pretty well
stopped. Shaughnessy's ends chased
Sewell all over the lot on his pass

ers' lead in three lightning strokes.
TOUCHDOWN MARCH
But they didn't stop there. Another
thrust carried all of 83 yards to a
touchdown in the second period.
This journey featured the running
of the unstoppable Kmetovic arid
shifty little A1 Cole. The pay-off
came on third down on the Staters'
26 with three yards to go for a new
set of downs when Albert, called the
unorthodox play for such a situa
tion—a pass.
It caught the Cougars unprepared
and Albert pitched to slippery Eii<
Armstrong in the end /.one for the
second Card score. Albert again
converted and Shaughnessy's outfit
was safely away to the fourth
straight victory.
73 YARDS IN FOUR PLAYS
The remaining two Indian touch
downs came close on the heels of
one another in the third quarter.
The first of these was another long
drive for 73 yards and the Reds,
dressed in white last. Saturday,
moved this distance in only four
plays, one play by each backfield
man.
Hugh Gallameau hit tackle for 4
yards to the Cards' own 31. Kmeto
vic was away again and this time
for 11 yardf>. Next it was Standlee
and he steamed 30 more yards down
the middle of the field to Washing
ton State's 33.
And now it was Albert's turn to
finish what his three teammates had
started. Frankie faded to pass and
hit Freddie Meyer directly on the
goal line with another beautiful
touchdown pass.
COUGAR FUMBLE HELPS
As if the havoc they had wrought
so far wasn't humiliating enough to
the Cougars before the eyes of their
large home coming crowd, the still
unsatisfied Indians rudely grabbed
another touchdown in the next
three minutes.
Vic Lindskog, rugged Card cen
ter, caused and recovered a W.S.C.
fumble on the Cougar 30. It was
the first scoring opportunity that
had been given to the Indians as
more or less of a gift and they soon
capitalized on it.
Albert lateraled to Gallarneau
and Hugh stepped off half the dis
tance to the goal line. Kmetovic fol
lowed his running mate's example
on the next play and outsped a
horde of Cougar defenders to dive
into the end zone.
SEWELL'S PASSES CLICK
Thus ended scoring activities for
Stanford for the afternoon and the
remainder of the game saw Wash
ington State wear down and finally
break through the stubborn Card
second and third strings to get a

long denied touchdown. Sewell's
feared passes clicked again as they
had done on the first Cougar drive
and a battering fullback, Dick Ren
fro, provided the punch to carry over
the Card goal.
Except for the frightening early
minute barrage of passes and the
final touchdown march by the Stat
ers, Sewell's tosses were pretty well
stopped. Shaughnessy's ends chased
Sewell all over the lot on his pass
ing attempts and a six-man Card
backfield batted down most of the
aerials he got away.
The streamlined Indian coaching
staff saw fit to use a total of 35 of
its available 37 players and the great
lot of experience gained by many
second and third stringers is bound
to pay dividends later in the year
when the going gets tough.
