want to see an increasingly large
number of our young people in state
correctional institutions," Dr. Eells
said.
The conference here was one of
20 held at various educational cen

Dr. Eells said that junior college
education must be dual in character
with cultural courses designed to
emphasize "civic usefulness and

"Of the 75 per cent of junior col
lege students who should have semi
professional courses, only 34 per
cent at present have the opportunity
to take them," he declared.
