NEW YORK. Oct. 20 (UP).â€”ln
dustrial activity raced ahead last
week to new highs, but stocks crept
forward cautiously as traders lim
ited commitments pending further
developments in both the domestic
. nd international political situations.
Market sentiment appeared slight
ly more favorable, but most traders
were hesitant to lengthen their long
positions because of the confused
situations in the Balkans and the
Far East. In addition, there was a
tendency to go slow pending more
definite indications of the outcome
of the presidential race.
