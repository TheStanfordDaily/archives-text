# Players to Repeat Summer Success, 'Mr. Congressman'
## 
### 
Following on the heels of a successful "Poor of New York," Stanford's
packed theater season will offer Leon Pearson's "Mr. Congressman," a
satire on Washington politics which was presented with great success
at Stanford during the summer.
The Pearson play will open for a two-night run Friday, Oct. 25. in the
â™¦Little Theater. "Mr. Congressman"

was given in its present form for the
first time here this summer.
Many of the original cast, which
was composed mostly of faculty
members, will play in the autumn
presentation. Dr. Virgil K. Whita
ker, assistant professor of English,
will again play the leading role of
Sam Anders, big, blustering con
gressman from Georgia. Other mem
bers of the cast will be announced
tomorrow.
The plot of the show revolves
around the old-fashioned Democrat
system of swapping votes for patron
age to insure re-election to Congress.
When the New Deal comes into
power, Sam Anders finds his sys
tem up against it, and attempts to
continue his old practices by swap
ping votes with Republicans across
the aisle.
Opponents of Sam Anders dig up
an old scandal and threaten him
with it, and the complications which
ensue provide an entertaining satire
of mix-ups and misunderstandings.
Pearson's satire is especially
timely because of election year, but
even this presents a problem to for
eign movie companies and New
York producers who are considering
it for production, because after the
election the plot will have to be
further rearranged to keep it from
being out of date.
This play is not included on the
season ticket because of its pre
vious presentation at Stanford. Tick
' ets are 50 cents each, and may bo
j obtained at the box office, or by
j calling Mr. Barker at PA. 22041.
