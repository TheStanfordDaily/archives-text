SAN PEDRO, Oct. 20 (UP).â€”The :
second detachment of the United
States fleet to return from prolonged !
Hawaiian maneuvers was arrivftig ;
through an offshore haze tonight at I
San Pedro, Long Beach, and San
Diego.
The first contingent of the fleet !
arrived three weeks ago and sailed
again last Monday. Navy com
manders are bringing the detach
ments home for delayed shore leave
for personnel, to obtain supplies and
to embark with new recruits.
Road maps are not a modern idea;
Romans used them.
