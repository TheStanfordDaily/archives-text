FOLKESTONE, Eng., Mon., Oct.
21 (UP). â€”British bombers shuttling
in swarms across the Channel at 10-
minute intervals wreaked havoc
upon Adolf Hitler's "invasion ports"
last night and early today in the
R.A.F.'s most savage assault upon
the Nazi held French coast.
Tons of bombs crashing at times
at the rate of 100 a minute spread
a fiery path after a duel of unprece
dented intensity between British
and German long range guns point
ed at each other across the Channel.
At midnight the British aerial
bombardment had been under way
five hours and seemed to be in
creasing in fury, with flight after
flight of British planes taking off in
an almost unbroken, droning arc
above the Channel.
The Air Ministry in London, de
scribing week-end counter attacks
of the R.A.F. against Nazi objec
tives, said that bad weather limited
the scope of the attacks but that the
| big Osnabruck Railroad yards in
1 western Germany, an airdrome in
j northern Holland and several other
; airdromes were bombed.
The Admiralty, meanwhile, an
! nounced that naval planes, striking
again at Hiler's reported concentra
tions of "invasion forces" along the
Norwegian coasts, had heavily
bombed the Nazi seaplane base at
Tromsoe.
