# Frosh Trounce Modesto J.C. 47-6
## Shipkeymen Show Power In Third Win 
### DON SELBY 
Flashing a savage attack that
paid off in every period except the]
second, Stanford's freshman grid
ders walloped Modesto Junior Col
lege, 47-(>, in Stanford Stadium Sat
urday.
The win, Stanford's third in as
many games, marked the frosh as a
threat to cop the "little four"
championship, the "little four" in
cluding Cal, U.S.C., U.C.L.A., and
Stanford freshman teams. The
Trobabes, who defeated the Cal
frosh, 19-0, Saturday, loom as the
team to beat.
Briefly, the scoring:
1. A 50-yard march, starting the
first time the Papoose eleven gained
possession of the ball, was climaxed
by Randall "Buck" Fawcett's one
yard drive through center for 1
yard and a touchdown. End Jim
Ellis kicked true on the conversion
attempt.
2. Recovering a Modesto fumble
on the Pirates' 20-yard line, the
yearling gridders required but four
plays to go to the I j-yard line, from
which point Fawcett again tallied
on a crack at the line. Ellis kicked
the extra point. Score: Stanford
Frosh 14, Modesto J.C. 10.
MODESTO TALLIES ONCE
3. For the only second quarter
touchdown, Modesto drove 56 yards
over the Papoose second string, tal
lying on a 15-yard Bradley-to-
Davey pass in the end zone. Davey's
place-kick for the point-after-touch
down was wide. Score: Stanford
Frosh 14, Modesto J.C. 0.
4. The Frosh, featuring the run
ning of Bob Mitchell and Joe Mar
desich, marched goalward from their
own 35-yard line in 10 running
plays. Fawcett hit left guard for 3
yards and a touchdown on the tenth
play. Ellis' kick for the extra point
marked his eighth successful conver
sion in the same number of attempts
this season.
5. Jim Troupe's 10-yard jaunt and
Mitchell's passes to Ellis and Bill
Bin baker took the Papooses 62 yards
to the Pirate 1-yard marker, from
which point Mitchell tallied on a
quarterback sneak from "T" forma
tion. Ellis' kick was no good. Score:
Stanford Frosh 27, Modesto J.C. 6.
RESERVES SCORE
6. Troupe, Mardesich, and Frank
Forbes, a trio of reserve backs, ran
and passed the Frosh 48 yards to
Modesto's 11-yard line. Mardesich
took a reverse from Lee Scott and,
aided by a beautiful open field block
by Larry Wolf, skirted the Pirate
l'ight end to pay dirt. Jack Reynolds'
conversion attempt was low.
7. Troupe ran around the Pjrate
right flank from the enemy 3-yard
line and dove through the last three
defenders for a touchdown. Rey
nolds kicked the extra point. Score:
Stanford Frosh 40, Modesto J.C. 6.
8. Troupe personally accounted for
the final Papoose tally when he in
tercepted Modesto Quarterback
Klinger's pass on the Pirate 40 and
outran the intended receiver to
touchdown territory. Reynolds add
ed the extra point. Final score:
Stanford Frosh 47, Modesto J.C. 6.
LA PRADE OUTSTANDING
To pick stars on the frosh eleven
in a game in which they used 39
players is difficult and perhaps un
fair in that no one person could see
all the good plays made. However,
it must be said that Loren LaPrade,
center, was outstanding, especially
on defense, where he was making
tackles all over the lot. The same
might be said of John Kenward,
starting quarterback.
Surprising was the fine offensive
play of three heretofore unheralded
reserve backs, Jim Troupe, Lee
Scott, and Joe Mardesich. The lat
ter played most of the game at right
half in place of Bob Koch, who was
sick and played only the first few
minutes.
Among the players used by Coach
Harry Shipkey were: Tyler Norton,
Wolf, Forbes. Mardesich. Doyle
Coldiron, Todd Gardner. Dick Ab
rams, Fawcett. Carroll Byrd, Kelly
Ross, Fred Howell, Mitchell, Koch.
Brubaker, Bill Nourse, and Ellis.
