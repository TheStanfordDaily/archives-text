# Frosh Soccermen Drop Friday Tilt
## 
### 
Pescadero High kicked in a goal j
early in the fourth quarter to nose j
out the frosh soccer team 1-0 Fri
day afternoon.
It was the Papooses' first defeat
of the season, having tied Menlo J.C.
in their opening encounter. Al
though Stanford outplayed their
foes again throughout most of the
game, they still lack an offense
capable of manufacturing a goal.
Soon after the Indian freshman
second string had gone in, "Pesky,"
who kept their starting lineup prac
tically intact during the entire game,
inaugurated a drive that terminated
in score.
