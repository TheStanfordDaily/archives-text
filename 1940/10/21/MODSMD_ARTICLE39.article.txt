All American situation is 1
getting to be a bit of a mess.
There are too darn many good backs
in this country for any four players j
to be rated tops over the rest.
One thing looks like a cinch. I
Western sports writers will have to
do a lot of talking to get around !
naming Norm Standlee' one of the
four greatest backs in the country.
The Chief has one big factor on
his side, if you want Jolting John
Kimbrough at fullback, you could
very well use Standlee at one of
the halfback positions.
Norm has the speed to play
halfback, and his great defensive
play and towering punts added
to his powerful line-plunging,
would make him valuable on any
mythical eleven.
Shifting the players around a little |
from their Usual positions, how j
would you like to watch this quartet
in action? Bill De Correvont at
quarter, Tommy Harmon and Norm
Standlee at halfbacks, and John j
Kimbrough at fullback.
That, friends, would be quite a !
combination. De Correvont and j
Harmon are climax runners de luxe,
and both can pass adequately. For ,
power you have Standlee and Kim- |
brough, both of whom can also pass
a little. These two could also di
vide the kicking duties.
While on the subject of all
something - or - other teams, it
looks as though the Bay Area has
I a couple of good candidates for
All-Coast tackles in Cal's Boh
Reinhard and Stanford's Bruno
Banducci.
Incidentally, Manducci won the
Zwierlein Shoe Award for his ag
gressive play in the Oregon game,
and Vic Lindskog won it for the
Santa Clara game.

r pHANKS fellas.
The Indians really made this
column look good when they per
formed up at. Pullman Saturday.
In the first place. Lucky Louie
picked them to win by two touch
downs. So the final score was 26-
! 14. They didn't even throw in an
extra conversion to mess things
up.
Let's quote a paragraph or two
from last Friday's column. Follow -
I ing a discussion of Sewell's passing
ability, Slants enlarged as follows:
"The Indians can turn on a pretty
nice passing attack of their own if

! they feel like it. Frankie Albert
hasn't been hitting very consistently
so far this fall, but if and when he
has a hot day the results will be
i sensational."
* * *
So Stanford completed seven out
of twelve aerial thrusts, Albert
firing two touchdown passes.
A little later in the column. "While
on the subject, it may be well to
mention that the number one and
two fullbacks, Norm Standlee and
Miit Vucinich, also have a speaking
! acquaintance with the art ..."
Vucinich completed a 36-yard for
j ward to Clem Tomerlin on the sec
ond Stanford touchdown march.
Keep it up, fellas, it's great to be
right.
* * *
Stretching things a little, Wash
ington State was the fourth unde
feated team the Shaughnessymen
have knocked over in as many
weeks. Next week the Trojans
come a-visiting, also with an uii-
I beaten record for the Indians to
! tee off on.

r pHANKS fellas.
The Indians really made this
column look good when they per
formed up at. Pullman Saturday.
In the first place. Lucky Louie
picked them to win by two touch
downs. So the final score was 26-
! 14. They didn't even throw in an
extra conversion to mess things
up.
Let's quote a paragraph or two
from last Friday's column. Follow -
I ing a discussion of Sewell's passing
ability, Slants enlarged as follows:
"The Indians can turn on a pretty
nice passing attack of their own if

! they feel like it. Frankie Albert
hasn't been hitting very consistently
so far this fall, but if and when he
has a hot day the results will be
i sensational."
* * *
So Stanford completed seven out
of twelve aerial thrusts, Albert
firing two touchdown passes.
A little later in the column. "While
on the subject, it may be well to
mention that the number one and
two fullbacks, Norm Standlee and
Miit Vucinich, also have a speaking
! acquaintance with the art ..."
Vucinich completed a 36-yard for
j ward to Clem Tomerlin on the sec
ond Stanford touchdown march.
Keep it up, fellas, it's great to be
right.
* * *
Stretching things a little, Wash
ington State was the fourth unde
feated team the Shaughnessymen
have knocked over in as many
weeks. Next week the Trojans
come a-visiting, also with an uii-
I beaten record for the Indians to
! tee off on.
All American situation is 1
getting to be a bit of a mess.
There are too darn many good backs
in this country for any four players j
to be rated tops over the rest.
One thing looks like a cinch. I
Western sports writers will have to
do a lot of talking to get around !
naming Norm Standlee' one of the
four greatest backs in the country.
The Chief has one big factor on
his side, if you want Jolting John
Kimbrough at fullback, you could
very well use Standlee at one of
the halfback positions.
Norm has the speed to play
halfback, and his great defensive
play and towering punts added
to his powerful line-plunging,
would make him valuable on any
mythical eleven.
Shifting the players around a little |
from their Usual positions, how j
would you like to watch this quartet
in action? Bill De Correvont at
quarter, Tommy Harmon and Norm
Standlee at halfbacks, and John j
Kimbrough at fullback.
That, friends, would be quite a !
combination. De Correvont and j
Harmon are climax runners de luxe,
and both can pass adequately. For ,
power you have Standlee and Kim- |
brough, both of whom can also pass
a little. These two could also di
vide the kicking duties.
While on the subject of all
something - or - other teams, it
looks as though the Bay Area has
I a couple of good candidates for
All-Coast tackles in Cal's Boh
Reinhard and Stanford's Bruno
Banducci.
Incidentally, Manducci won the
Zwierlein Shoe Award for his ag
gressive play in the Oregon game,
and Vic Lindskog won it for the
Santa Clara game.
