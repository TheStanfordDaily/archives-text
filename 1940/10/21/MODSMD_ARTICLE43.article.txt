# Tolerance of Intolerance
## 
### 
CHIEF JUSTICE HOLMES, in one of his most
famous opinions, stated that America's
freedom of speech depended upon the right of
persons to utter that which we find obnoxious.
Expressing the postulate that only by toler
ating those whose theories are onerous to us
may we continue to enjoy our constitutionally
guaranteed privilege of free speech, the Chief
Justice pleaded with the United States to pre
serve the minority's right of egual utterance.
Leon R. Yankwich, noted California Federal
District jurist, addressing a meeting of profes
sional and collegiate journalists in San Fran
cisco last week-end, vigorously applauded
Holmes' sentiments, adding that as long as we
allow the minority to say that which we despise,
we need never fear for our personal freedom.
The First and Fourteenth Amendments are
the authorities by which Americans receive
their right of free speech. The First Amendment
says specifically that Congress shall make no
law . . . abridging the Ireedom oi speech.
The Fourteenth Amendment, while making
no actual mention of freedom of speech, guar
antees that no State shall deprive any person
of life, liberty, or property, without due process
of law. Through the years, according to Judge
Yankwich, jurists have read freedom of speech
into the above phrase by classifying it as a part
of our life, liberty, and property.
Except during times of national emergency,
then, residents of the United States are doubly
guaranteed eguality of oral and written ex
pression. It might not be inaccurate to say that
America's progress is founded to a large extent
upon this principle.
And yet, it seems to this writer, a distinction
should be drawn on Justice Holmes' opinion.
There certainly is a difference between an ar
dent Willkie supporter listening to arguments
in favor of Roosevelt and an American listening
to a disciple of Stalin or Hitler.
No matter how badly the Willkie man may
despise arguments in favor of Roosevelt, he is
still listening to an apostle of the American
way of life. ,
But to use our Constitution, an instrument in
itself predicated upon free speech, as a spring
board for ideologies that know nothing of such
a basic principle, seems the height of paradoxy.
That this is not an academic question is ap
parent. The side can be, and is, taken by rep
resentatives of foreign -isms that their ideology
is superior to ours. Therefore, by means of the
First and Fourteenth Amendments, we profit
by the opportunity to have the other forms of
government expressed and explained.
In other words, say these opponents of de
mocracy, freedom of speech was guaranteed so
that diverse opinions would be freely dissemi
nated for the benefit of the United States. If
the United States wants a change in its form of
government, thinks that it may gain by another
type of government, actually freedom of speech
is not being trampled upon, but redounds to the
greater benefit of this country.
This is a point that perhaps superficially rings
true. What isn't pointed out, however, is the
fact that in the home countries of these -isms,
there is no such thing as free expression if a
person disagrees with the ideology . . . their
people are not given an opportunity to express
dissatisfaction. If perchance they wanted to
be democratic as we are, they could find no way
to represent themselves.
Tolerance is a virtue there is none greater,
say many philosophers. The Constitution's tol
erance of intolerance may be something else
again.— G. M.

That this is not an academic question is ap
parent. The side can be, and is, taken by rep
resentatives of foreign -isms that their ideology
is superior to ours. Therefore, by means of the
First and Fourteenth Amendments, we profit
by the opportunity to have the other forms of
government expressed and explained.
In other words, say these opponents of de
mocracy, freedom of speech was guaranteed so
that diverse opinions would be freely dissemi
nated for the benefit of the United States. If
the United States wants a change in its form of
government, thinks that it may gain by another
type of government, actually freedom of speech
is not being trampled upon, but redounds to the
greater benefit of this country.
This is a point that perhaps superficially rings
true. What isn't pointed out, however, is the
fact that in the home countries of these -isms,
there is no such thing as free expression if a
person disagrees with the ideology . . . their
people are not given an opportunity to express
dissatisfaction. If perchance they wanted to
be democratic as we are, they could find no way
to represent themselves.
Tolerance is a virtue there is none greater,

CHIEF JUSTICE HOLMES, in one of his most
famous opinions, stated that America's
freedom of speech depended upon the right of
persons to utter that which we find obnoxious.
Expressing the postulate that only by toler
ating those whose theories are onerous to us
may we continue to enjoy our constitutionally
guaranteed privilege of free speech, the Chief
Justice pleaded with the United States to pre
serve the minority's right of egual utterance.
Leon R. Yankwich, noted California Federal
District jurist, addressing a meeting of profes
sional and collegiate journalists in San Fran
cisco last week-end, vigorously applauded
Holmes' sentiments, adding that as long as we
allow the minority to say that which we despise,
we need never fear for our personal freedom.
The First and Fourteenth Amendments are
the authorities by which Americans receive
their right of free speech. The First Amendment
says specifically that Congress shall make no
law . . . abridging the Ireedom oi speech.
The Fourteenth Amendment, while making
no actual mention of freedom of speech, guar
antees that no State shall deprive any person
of life, liberty, or property, without due process
of law. Through the years, according to Judge
Yankwich, jurists have read freedom of speech
into the above phrase by classifying it as a part
of our life, liberty, and property.
Except during times of national emergency,
then, residents of the United States are doubly
guaranteed eguality of oral and written ex
pression. It might not be inaccurate to say that
America's progress is founded to a large extent
upon this principle.
And yet, it seems to this writer, a distinction
should be drawn on Justice Holmes' opinion.
There certainly is a difference between an ar
dent Willkie supporter listening to arguments
in favor of Roosevelt and an American listening
to a disciple of Stalin or Hitler.
No matter how badly the Willkie man may
despise arguments in favor of Roosevelt, he is
still listening to an apostle of the American
way of life. ,
But to use our Constitution, an instrument in
itself predicated upon free speech, as a spring
board for ideologies that know nothing of such
a basic principle, seems the height of paradoxy.
