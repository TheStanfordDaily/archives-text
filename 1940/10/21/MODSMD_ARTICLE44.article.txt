WHO? WELL, YOU'LL DO AS WELL
r THE coefficient of correlation between Bawlout sales
and phone calls through the 3121 exchange is
strikingly high. Fraternity men and sorority women,
all holding 15 cents in their little hot hands, jammed
the cashier's office last week, in hopes of grabbing off
the first copies. Then—they ran, not walked, to the
nearest phone.
"Hello, 3121? Where ya been? Layin' a cable?
Oh . . . Okey, okey, I guess you had every right to
do that . . . Well, anyway, connect me up with
room 498 Encina, will ya . . . Hmmm, hmmm, oh, beat
me daddy eight to the bar with my registration
card ..."
The jjhone clicks, and the operator and room 498
talk it over about a hot one in the third race at Bay
Meadows. Also the 144 possible combinations on the
Daily Double tote board. Our row man shouts to the
operator:
"Hey, operator, please. I made the call; not you—l
think. (Click) Hello, hello, is this room 498? Is this
Charles Mortimer Glurkburger? Charles Glurkburger,
LD, post office box 1239? Yeah? Well, hy ya Charley,
old pal. Thus is Edwin Frump up at the Tappa Kega
Beer house. Don't you remember; I met you this sum
mer? Podunk is my home town, too."
"But I don't live in Podunk."
"What ya mean, it says so right here in the Bawl
out —I mean what ya mean? Well, I tell you, Charley,
old pal, how about meeting me and a couple of the
boys for a coke anyway? Swell, swell, we'll see you
down at the Huh? Naw, naw, course you
don't have to wear your shoes. Say, are you sure
you don't live in Podunk?"

1 AST Wednesday night the hall men held an open
house smoker in the halls for all interested Encina
men. Even those mildly interested. Now Lagunita
has gotten a whiff of what is going on, so the girls
have decided to "fete" Roble with a Hallowe'en tea.
And cigars, too?

The Stanford Bookstore has instituted a different
system of student profit-sharing this year. Last year,
after you got a sales slip you merely signed your name
on it and dropped it into a box right in the store. This
year the box is gone. Now you've got to save all your
tickets up all year long, and then turn them in in a
nifty envelope at the end of the year. This system is
based on the fact that it is much, MUCH easier to
pack around a bunch of paper slips all year without
losing them, and on the fact that it is easier to pack
them to the Bookstore at the end of the year than it
is to drop them right into a box as you get them. Yeah.
What do you think of Harry Bridges' chances in
the presidential election?

Due to the fact that we have a little breather with
Southern California, the Library officials have decided
to close the Reserved Book Room this Saturday for the
afternoon.
Shucks! Ain't that a sandwich.

nifty envelope at the end of the year. This system is
based on the fact that it is much, MUCH easier to
pack around a bunch of paper slips all year without
losing them, and on the fact that it is easier to pack
them to the Bookstore at the end of the year than it
is to drop them right into a box as you get them. Yeah.
What do you think of Harry Bridges' chances in

Due to the fact that we have a little breather with
Southern California, the Library officials have decided

afternoon.
Shucks! Ain't that a sandwich.
WHO? WELL, YOU'LL DO AS WELL
r THE coefficient of correlation between Bawlout sales
and phone calls through the 3121 exchange is
strikingly high. Fraternity men and sorority women,
all holding 15 cents in their little hot hands, jammed
the cashier's office last week, in hopes of grabbing off
the first copies. Then—they ran, not walked, to the
nearest phone.
"Hello, 3121? Where ya been? Layin' a cable?
Oh . . . Okey, okey, I guess you had every right to
do that . . . Well, anyway, connect me up with
room 498 Encina, will ya . . . Hmmm, hmmm, oh, beat
me daddy eight to the bar with my registration
card ..."
The jjhone clicks, and the operator and room 498
talk it over about a hot one in the third race at Bay
Meadows. Also the 144 possible combinations on the
Daily Double tote board. Our row man shouts to the
operator:
"Hey, operator, please. I made the call; not you—l
think. (Click) Hello, hello, is this room 498? Is this
Charles Mortimer Glurkburger? Charles Glurkburger,
LD, post office box 1239? Yeah? Well, hy ya Charley,
old pal. Thus is Edwin Frump up at the Tappa Kega
Beer house. Don't you remember; I met you this sum
mer? Podunk is my home town, too."
"But I don't live in Podunk."
"What ya mean, it says so right here in the Bawl
out —I mean what ya mean? Well, I tell you, Charley,
old pal, how about meeting me and a couple of the
boys for a coke anyway? Swell, swell, we'll see you
down at the Huh? Naw, naw, course you
don't have to wear your shoes. Say, are you sure
you don't live in Podunk?"

1 AST Wednesday night the hall men held an open
house smoker in the halls for all interested Encina
men. Even those mildly interested. Now Lagunita
has gotten a whiff of what is going on, so the girls
have decided to "fete" Roble with a Hallowe'en tea.
And cigars, too?

The Stanford Bookstore has instituted a different
system of student profit-sharing this year. Last year,
after you got a sales slip you merely signed your name
on it and dropped it into a box right in the store. This
year the box is gone. Now you've got to save all your
tickets up all year long, and then turn them in in a
nifty envelope at the end of the year. This system is
based on the fact that it is much, MUCH easier to
pack around a bunch of paper slips all year without
losing them, and on the fact that it is easier to pack
