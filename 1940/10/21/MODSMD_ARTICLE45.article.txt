# CAMPUS OPINION
## GOVERNMENT BENEFITS 
### 
r EDITOR, SIR:
A few of us who are soon to be the beneficiaries
of government's plan to give us instruction in the
fine and useful arts of handling a bayonet, etc., were
perusing the article on the poll concerning the draft
when we ran across the statement attributed to a
nameless sophomore woman that '"It will be good
training for them, and useful, too, if they ever get
out."
At first glance we were gratified by this seem
ingly patriotic observation, but when we got to think
ing about it, the thought struck us that the phrase
'if they ever get out" had a sinister ring to it. Hie
more we thought it over, the more we felt that here
was an example of a shirker wanting others to be
patriotic, but steering clear of any inconveniences
herself.
Although it pains us, we feel compelled to point
out a few opportunities for service which our friend,
the sophomore woman, has herself so far overlooked.
We read the other day in an S.F. paper that the mag
nificent Lily Pons had offered to take over the duties
of kitchen police in one of the training camps. She
pointed out that she was a good cook, which we
have every reason to believe is also true of all Stanford
sophomore women.
However, if the Army's equivalent of Dean J. B.
should look askance at this proposal, we might sug
gest that it would be altogether fitting if the sopho
more woman with some of her friends volunteered to
attend registration for the draft and confer some re
ward, on the order of a kiss, say to each fortieth
registrant, or whatever is the number likely to be
called on immediately.
Let the dictators beware!
