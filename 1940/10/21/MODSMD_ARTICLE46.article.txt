# STANFORD'S 'UNWRITTEN' LAW
## 
### 
r EDITOR, SIR:
The age old and beneficial school rule concerning
"No smoking on the Quad" is generally recognized
and faithfully observed by all but a very few selfish
students. These flagrant violators seem to be concen
trated in one small group, namely, the Law Students.
Now no one breaks a rule without a reason or ex
cuse, so let's examine why these particular persons
smoke on the Quad.
1. They are a special privileged class?
2. They are so pressed by study that it is impos
sible to step out to the street, 100 feet away?
3. They just don't give a damn?
The first reason is, of course, eliminated without
argument. Law students are just a part of Stanford's
democratic family. The second reason is somewhat
silly, for it is well known that many football players
enter law schools after graduation because the course
is relatively easy. The third reason is more legiti
mate; however, I hate to think Stanford is turning out
men to represent them in later years with such weak
character. Now certainly we should want to make
every effort, especially on the part of our graduate
students, to build character and tradition. So, come
on fellows, smoke elsewhere and don't show us that
your cigarettes are stronger than you yourself!
