# THE 						GOLDEN CALF

### 
"THE EDITOF?, SIR:
Before it is too late, permit me to give Stanford
women a sort of Lochiel's Warning against taking, un
diluted, the sex appeal of Wendell Willkie:
Co-eds, Co-eds!
Beware of the day,
When Willkie shall meet thee
In utilities array.
Yes, indeed, Stanford ladies, decide this very hour
whether it is better to revive the worship of the golden
calf or stick to Moses who, though opposed by fearful
odds, is surely leading the American people out of
the bondage of their utilities corporations.
Yours very truly,
Robert Elder
