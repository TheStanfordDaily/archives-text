# Bidu Sayao Wins Plaudits For Aria In 'La Boheme'
## 
### 
Bidu Sayao and Jussi Bjocrling, as Mimi and Rudolph, received San
Francisco's wannest enthusiasm in "La Boheme" Friday night. Bjoerling,
making his operatic debut here, gave the role the emotion and tenderness
of feeling that the character of a poet should have. Sayao for the second
time this season had to accept the audience's spirited applause after

Mimi's aria in the first act, "Mi,
Chiamano Mimi."
Margit Bokor, in the part of Mu
setta, had too harsh a quality in her
voice for the requirements of the
music. In the second act —which is
to a large extent Musetta's act—her
volume was full and powerful in
the aria "Musetta's Waltz," but
needed to be tempered by softness.
Marcel, the painter, was sung by
John Brownlee, who played and
sang the part of a happy-go-lucky
Bohemian with a rich baritone voice,
as did George Cehanovsky as
Schaunard the musician.
Completing the part of the four
Bohemians, Ezio Pinza in the role
of Collin, the philosopher, sang in
his customary full-toned bass.
The orchestra, under the direction
of Gennaro Papi, brought out the
dramatic quality of Puccini's or
chestration but at times drowned
out the tenor and soprano voices.
The sets in the second and third
acts gave the performance the local
color of the Italian realistic school
of opera. Especially beautiful was
the third act set, with snow fallling
outside the Orleans gates of Paris.
"La Boheme" will be repeated
with the same cast on Tuesday, Oc
