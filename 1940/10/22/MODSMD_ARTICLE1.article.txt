â–  RUSSIA'S decision in the present
Balkan crisis is awaited by the
entire world.

If Russia decides to co-operate
with Hitler and sanction his drive to
the Black Sea and the Near East
cm oil fields, the position of Britain
and her allies becomes very much
more critical; for Britain's tradi
tional lifelines would be severely
threatened for the first time.

If Russia decides to abandon her
Nazi ally, the position of Britain
and her allies cannot but be much
improved, for such a move would
mean the end of one of Hitler's most
valuable alliances. It is hardly con
ceivable that Stalin could denounce
Htiler's drive to the East and at the
same time continue to send aid to
Germany that would help Hitler ex
ecute this drive.

Military tacticians in the United
States have pointed out the sig
nificance of any German move
that would imperial the Suez
Canal. Nazi control of the Suez,
they say, means the end of Brit
ish supremacy in the Mediter
ranean and the entire Near East.
In brief, Nazi control of the Suez
would mean the cutting off of
Britain's most important life-line.

AT the present time, Britain's war
machine is able to procure tre
mendous oil supplies from Iraq and
Iran, better known as Persia. Brit
ish petroleum interests in both of
these countries have contributed
about half of her oil requirements
during the present war; she cannot
afford to lose these sources of a vital
material.

Should Russia tolerate a German
invasion of Turkey, the Nazis would
not need to control the Suez Canal
order to gain access to these rich
oil sources. A railway line already
exists from Baghdad to Mosul in
Iran and a roadway connects this
line with a Turkish railway which
leads to Scutai'i from which Ger
man tankers could bring the oil up
the Danube into Greater Germany.
Russia's decision may mean vic
tory or defeat for the British Empire.

JOSEPH P. KENNEDY, the United
States ambassador ot Great
Britain, is on his way home today ot
report to President Roosevelt and
Secretary of State Hull. Ambassa
dor Kennedy has had conversations
with important Balkan diplomats in
London for the past few days, and
he undoubtedly will present their
"warnings" to the White House.

Although rumors have persisted
that Kennedy will resign his post
upon his return to this country, no
special significance has heen con
nected with such a move. It is
known that Kennedy has not been
entirely sympathetic to the all
aid-short-of-war policy of the Ad
ministration. and he may feel ob
liged to yield to a policy that the
majority of Americans have sup
ported.

According to United Press reports
received in the United States yes
terday, Balkan diplomats in London
have warned Kennedy that failure
of the United States to enter the
war before January 1 will mean that
the entire Mediterranean region will
fall to Hitler or Axis domination.
The dynamite in such an argument
needs no elucidation.

This is the "warning" that a Presi
dent, cognizant of the significance of
control of the Mediterranean and
deeply partisan in the conflict, will
hear.
