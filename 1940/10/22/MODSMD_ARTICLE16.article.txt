# CAMPUS DINGS ARMED AID FOR BRITAIN
## 
### HERM SILVERMAN 
England must fight her battle against Germany without
America's soldiers or sailors, in the opinion of Stanford students.
Such opinion apparently does not result from a fear that
aimed participation would be futile in the face of Britain's present
critical position; for the cross-section of the campus, interviewed
by The Stanford Daily, indicated that even if Britain holds out
until spring, America should still withhold any armed assistance.
Women are more in favor of active aid for England than men;
17 per cent of the women voted "Yes," while only 7 per cent of
the men agreed. However, women students were more unde
cided about the question than the men.
Asked, "Do you favor sending our military and naval forces
to aid England now?" 85 per cent of the students questioned
answered, "No." And opinion shifted only slightly on the ques
tion, "If England holds out until spring, should we send our
aimed forces?"—with 81 per cent voting "No." Interesting is this
minute change in opinion, revealing some doubt in the students'

minds as to the advisability of sending forces with a possible
English victory in sight. Complete tabulations are as follows:
Yes No Undecided
Help England now .... 10% 85% 5%
Help in spring 11% 81% 8%
Breaking the cross-section down according to class reveals
that lower division and graduate students approve of "active
participation now" more strongly than juniors or seniors. (Simi
lar results were found on the recent survey concerned with con
scription.)
Typical of students' comments was, "England has no need of
men; she needs equipment. Send military, naval, and aerial
material, but not armed forces." A student of opposite opinion
v rote, "Help England now—before it is too late and then we will
be in for it."
