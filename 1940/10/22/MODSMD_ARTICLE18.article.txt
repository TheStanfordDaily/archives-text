VISITED JAPAN
The students speaking tonight are
part of the American contingent
which numbered 58 delegates and of
which Ned Pugh was chairman. The
panels on art, religion, politics were
held at Tsuda College, outside
Tokyo.

During their stay in Japan and on
the continent the travelers were
guests of Japanese students. They
visited model factories, newspapers,
met government heads, and had a
taste of the atmosphere of war in
Manchukuo and near the Russian
city of Harbin.
IMPARTIAL ACCOUNTS

For the symposium the students
will make no attempt, to interpret
or comment on the situations and
places they observed during their
stay in the Orient, but will give an
account of what they saw and heard,
and let the audiences draw any con
clusions, Ned Pugh, final speaker of
the series, declared.

The symposium tonight will be
the second such program sponsored
by the Tuesday Evening Series. The
American Japan conferences started
in 1934, and in thcT summer of 1937
Stanford was host to the delegates
from Japan.
