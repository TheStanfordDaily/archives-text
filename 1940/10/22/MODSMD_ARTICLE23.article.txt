LONDON, Oct. 21 (UP).—Prime
Minister Winston Churchill prom
ised the world tonight Britain will
be master of the skies by 1911 and
the United States will aid in
crushing Adolf Hitler, whom he
called "this monstrous abortion of
hatred and deceit."
In a radio message of hope lr>
stricken France and her people,
Churchill scofTod at Hitler's inva
sion threats with the challenge that
Britain is "wailing for the long
promised invasion—and so are the
fishes."
Speaking first in French and
then in English in a world-wide
radio hookup, Churchill urged thu
Nazi-dominated French peoplo to
do nothing that might aid Hitler's
costly struggle against Britain.
He said Hitler's mounting crimes
are bringing upon him and all his
Nazi satellites a retribution "which
many of us will live to see."
"It will not be long," he promised.
"The story is not yet finished.
"We are on his track and so are
our friends across the Atlantic
Ocean."
PLEDGES AIR CONTROL
Speaking while German bombs
smashed upon London around him,
Churchill told of Hitler's boasts that
he would reduce London "to ashes"
but said Britain's air force has "more
than held its own."
"Now in 1940, we have, as always,
command of the sea. In 1941. we
shall have command of the air."
Churchill's broadcast was made
over several long and short wave
lengths to defeat any German at
tempt to "jam" it and prevent it
from reaching the ears of the
French people.
i He appealed to Anglo - French
unity despite the existing conditions
and said, "When good people get
into trouble because they have been
attacked and heavily smitten by the
vile and wicked they must be care
ful not to get at loggerheads with
one another."
