# Council Tells Egg Tossers To Beware
## Pajamarino Hecklers To Face Punishment; Car Drivers Warned 
### 
Egg throwers can expect trouble.
Such was the policy adopted by
Men's Council yesterday afternoon
in their weekly meeting. Discussion
of egg and tomato throwing arose in
connection with this Friday night's
pajamarino.
"Every year, a few students—very
seldom the freshmen — cause some
type of disturbance at the S.C. pa
jamarino," Wilson Cannon, chair
man of the Council, stated. "Last
year there was nearly a riot when
certain upper-classmen threw some
eggs. At present there are rumors
circulating that upper-class groups
are planning similar action."
NO POLICE AT RALLY
"Men's Council will not police the
pajamarino rally, but all trouble
makers who are reported will be
punished to the limit of the power
of Men's Council."
Other business of yesterday's
meeting dealt with student-violators
who fail to report to Council meet
ings upon the date of appearance
designated on the citation. All stu
dents who receive tickets should
check carefully the date they must
appear before the Council. Late
comers will receive increased fines.
TELL IT TO COUNCIL
If any person is unable to attend
such a meeting, he should inform a
member of Men's Council.
The meeting broke up after an
additional warning to students who
have been parking overtime in the
15-minute zones in front of the Ad
ministration Building. Complaints
of "not being able to see the signs"
will not be recognized since the signs
are considered sufficiently conspic
uous.
