## 
### 
With its new members approved by Ex Committee and an expense
account provided by the A.S.S.U. at its disposal, the Stanford Men's Voca
tional Committee got off to its second year of operation this week.
Frank Mallory, who succeeded Bruce Jessup as chairman of the com
mittee this year, made a statement of Vocom's aims yesterday:

► "In every group of college stu- !
dents there are many who have no '
eral vocational aim in mind, and j
who are just 'gliding along.' It is the I
aim of the Vocational Committee to '
give these students a chance to gain
information about various vocations
by-providing vocational books, maga
zines, and other publications, and 1
! sponsoring talks by and interviews !
with men prominent in the various j
vocational fields."

This year Vocom will again spon
sor a series of vocational talks on
campus in Winter Quarter by busi
ness and professional men from San j
Francisco and the Bay area and will i
also offer men students a chance to
interview those men personally dur
ing Spring Quarter. Both these pro- ■
grams were highly successful last i
year.
In addition to these services, Vo- I
com is carrying on a campus-wide j
campaign to publicize the Strong
Vocational Interest Test this quar
ter. This program got under way
during ihe Pre-Registration period,
when the test was offered to incom- j
ing freshmen at a reduced price.
STRONG TEST TAKEN
About SO freshmen took advantage I
of the offer, and the tests are now |
being returned to them, Mallory j
said. Each person who takes the j
test is given a personal interview
with a vocational adviser who at- j
tempts to make the results of the j
test more clear to the student.
Vocom may make the test avail- j
able to the entire campus at the re- j
duced price later in the quarter, j
Mallory said, but since arrange- j
ments for such a program are dif
ficult. to make, £>lans along that line j
are very indefinite as vet.

In addition to these services, Vo- I
com is carrying on a campus-wide j
campaign to publicize the Strong
Vocational Interest Test this quar
ter. This program got under way
during ihe Pre-Registration period,
when the test was offered to incom- j
ing freshmen at a reduced price.
STRONG TEST TAKEN
About SO freshmen took advantage I
of the offer, and the tests are now |
being returned to them, Mallory j
said. Each person who takes the j
test is given a personal interview
with a vocational adviser who at- j
tempts to make the results of the j
test more clear to the student.
Vocom may make the test avail- j
able to the entire campus at the re- j
duced price later in the quarter, j
Mallory said, but since arrange- j
ments for such a program are dif
ficult. to make, £>lans along that line j
are very indefinite as vet.
With its new members approved by Ex Committee and an expense
account provided by the A.S.S.U. at its disposal, the Stanford Men's Voca
tional Committee got off to its second year of operation this week.
Frank Mallory, who succeeded Bruce Jessup as chairman of the com
mittee this year, made a statement of Vocom's aims yesterday:

► "In every group of college stu- !
dents there are many who have no '
eral vocational aim in mind, and j
who are just 'gliding along.' It is the I
aim of the Vocational Committee to '
give these students a chance to gain
information about various vocations
by-providing vocational books, maga
zines, and other publications, and 1
! sponsoring talks by and interviews !
with men prominent in the various j
vocational fields."
SPONSOR TALKS
This year Vocom will again spon
sor a series of vocational talks on
campus in Winter Quarter by busi
ness and professional men from San j
Francisco and the Bay area and will i
also offer men students a chance to
interview those men personally dur
ing Spring Quarter. Both these pro- ■
grams were highly successful last i
year.
