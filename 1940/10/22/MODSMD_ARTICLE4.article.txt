Wayne Miller, John Wald, and
Don Forbes, the three men who bear
the major responsibility for the Rich
field Reporter newscasts, paid a brief
visit to the Farm yesterday to ap
pear as guest speakers at a special
luncheon in the Union dining hall.

Speaking on "Behind the Mike
with the Richfield Reporter" the
three-man staff of the nightly news
spot presented a discussion of the
groundwork for the program, and its
actual presentation on the air. Their
talks were supplemented by ques
tions from the lunchers.

Mr. Miller spoke of his work in
condensing 40,000 words of press re
leases to the 3000 words used in
the actual script each day. Prepara
tion of the script requires not only
condensation of the news, but also
changing the style to suit oral pres
entation, he explained.

Messrs. Wald and Forbes told
how copy reaches the Richfield Re
porters' main office in Los Angeles,
tracing the course of a story from
its origin to central European press
bureaus, and from there via cable
or wireless to the American bureaus.
From the American center, they
elucidated, stories are tapped by
teletype to local clients.
