OERHAPS we should devote more
space to minor sports and ease
up on the football situation. Maybe
we should slip in a good word now
and then for Harry Maloney's hard
working soccermen, for Nort Thorn
ton's water polo team, and for the
cross-country team Pitch Johnson is
assembling.
But with an undefeated and un
tied Rose Bowl contender on hand,
it's difficult to talk about other
things, especially after the last few
bleak seasons. Every time we sit
down to write about something else,
visions of New Year's Day in Pasa
dena intrude.
So, in the following talk about the
soccer team, don't let it worry you
if we drop a few split bucks in
amongst, the split infinitives.

practice started this fall
it didn't look as though Ma
loney, dean of Stanford coaches,
was going to have an eleven the
equal <• last year's potent outfit.
Even irvy himself, usually an
optir. .ic sort of guy, wasn't
talking much championship.
Even when the Cards downed
Menlo J.C., 4-0. in their opener, joy
didn't run rampant. The Oaks usu
ally turn out a battling team, but
thoir material isn't always of the
best.
But when the Maloneymen hung
a 3-1 defeat on the U.S.F. Dons in
the league premiere, things began
looking up. In the words of their
coach, '"It was a very hard game and
we functioned splendidly as a unit."
Nice words, those.
Offensively, the hooters are led
by a couple of Georges, Co-cap
tains La Xicca and Dole, function
ing from outside and inside right,
respectively, in the forward wall.
The Cards have a strong defen
sive trio in fullbacks Ned Pugh and
Dick Harman and Goalie Jack
Burns.

licity as American football, and
an attendance of 200 is considered a
large crowd for the sport here at
Stanford.
The game is really worth more
than that. From a spectator's view
point. it is extremely interesting.
You don't have to know all the
rules and ncr points to enjoy

Wander out to the .soccer field
some time and have a look. It won't
cost you a cent, and we'll guarantee
it will be well worth your time

Lucky Louie Limited stock took a
decided drop over the week-end. A
combination of bad weather in the
Midwest and upsets on the Coast

a long way. He called six out of ten
right, and now has a season's rec
