# Coast Water Polo Begins Saturday
## 
### 
Pacific Coast Conference water
polo will be formally ushered in
Saturday, when the Stanford In
dians entertain a tough U.S.C. con
tingent here in the home pools at
10:30 a.m. for the first of their two
game series.
The Trojans are a definite pre
game favorite, returning with vir
tually the same team that split the
series with last year's Card squad.
Stanford will probably put a team
into the water with only two var
sity veterans in the line-up.
However. Nort Thornton, Stanford
swimming coach, promises that any
thing can happen, and probably
will, as evidenced by a history of
past Stanford-U.S.C. squabbles.
Saturday's game, free to the pub
lic. promises to be just, as much a
fight as last year's battle and will
give spectators ample time to get to
the Card-Trojan football contest in
the afternoon. The Stanford fresh
man water polo team will meet. Palo
Alto High School in the preliminary
scheduled for 9:30 a.m.
