# Cougars Leave Cards Unhurt
## 
### 
Fortunately enough. Coach
Clark Shaughncssy's scampering
Indians came through another
tough, grueling hall game again
last Saturday without any serious
injuries. There were only three
Cards who were slowed up in the
least little hit during the taming of
the Cougar.
Crash - and - carry artist Norm
Standlee slightly pinched a nerve in
his leg during the first quarter
against W.S.C.; but he returned in
the last half, showing he was still
able to operate at 100 per cent effi
ciency by wheeling through the very
middle of the Cougars for 30 yards
at one crack.
TOMM EK LIN INJU RED
Another slight casualty was sub
stitute end Clemmie Tommerlin who
sprained his wrist. The injured joint
was heavily taped at practice yes
terday and Clemmie might possibly
wear a cast for the fast approaching
Trojan contest but will be ready to
play.
The only Cardinal not in a uni
form for yesterday's practice was
second string quarterback Ray
Hammett, who was on the sidelines
nursing a tender pointer received in
Saturday's game.
The varsity struck strictly to pol
ishing up on their offense in yes
terday's session, waiting for a few
days before going to work on the
defensive strategy which Coach
Sliaughnessy is dreaming up to stop
the Trojans through information
gathered from the reports of his
scouts.
LIGHT WORKOUT
The first stringers had a very
light workout last evening and were
off the practice field by 5:30, an
unusually early hour for them. The
second and third stringers stuck
around a little longer, also working
on their offense. Thor Peterson,
however, had a busy day handling
the quarterback assignments for
both the second and third strings
with Hammett taking things easy.
Meanwhile Assistant Coach Husky
Hunt was working with hi.s team of
reserves, teaching them U.S.C. plays
to throw at the varsity today or
tomorrow.
SEWELL STOPPED
Contrary to what The Daily re
ported yesterday concerning how
Shaughnessy's strategy stopped
Sewcll's passing attack, the ends
did not try to rush the Cougar passer
to death. Instead they attempted to
hold the eligible wingbacks at the
line of scrimmage while the Card
tackles handled the ends in the
same manner. Sewell, against this
type of defense, had all the time he
could use but found himself a little
short of receivers.
