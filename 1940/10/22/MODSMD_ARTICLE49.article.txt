# Papooses Meet Trobabes Next
## 
### 
With three straight victories un
der their collective belt Stanford's
lreshman gridders went to work
yesterday to prepare for their first
"crucial" of the season—their game
with the U.S.C. Frosh this Saturday.
The Trobabes, victors over the Cal
Cubs, will probably be the Papooses'
toughest game of the year. For the
boys from the South present a pow
erful and varied attack, featuring
the hard-running Bob Musick, kid
brother of the former U.S.C. star.
Jim Musick. The team is coached by
Gus Shaver, another ex-Trojan
great.
The fine display of talent by his
reserves against Modesto J.C. last
Saturday gives Frosh Mentor Harry
Shipkey added strength to throw
against the remaining three teams
that his charges have to face.
However, the question of whether
or not these reserves can stand up in
stiff competition is still unanswered,
for Modesto was a weak outfit,
thoroughly softened by the Papoose
first-stringers, by the time the sec
ond, third, and fourth-stringers got
into the fray.
Although right halfback Bob
Koch, passer and runner de luxe
in frosh's first two games, played
oniy a few minutes last Saturday
because of illness, he will probably
be back in top shape for the Tro
babe-Papoose contest.
