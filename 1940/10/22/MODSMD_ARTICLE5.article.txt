# Paly Store Robbed Of Goods, Money
## 
### 
Booty equivalent to nearly $900 in
merchandise and money was stolen
from the Phelps-Terkel men's store
in Palo Alto Sunday afternoon. The
burglar was heard pounding by at
least two persons around 3:30
o'clock, but they did not suspect
that, he was entering the establish
ment.
Gaining entrance through an open
! ing in the outer wall and knocking
| out the light well on the mezzanine
floor, the intruder evidently forced
the door of the safe by using a claw
hammer, and removed the contents,
j After filling a large bag with cloth
! ing he left by the same route.
