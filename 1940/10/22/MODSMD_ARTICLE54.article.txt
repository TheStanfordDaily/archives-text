SHAGGY relic of the old days when the title
"Stanford Rough" was decidedly no mere
slang term and when frosh and second-year
men bucolicly pummeled each other in cheerful
class struggles, was last year's pajamarino rally
before the U.S.C. game.
Last year's pavilion program accidentally in
cluded a minor throwback to the days when.
The more realistic weapons of the days of the
plug-ugly were simulated with ripe eggs and
riper tomatoes, but the night-shirted freshmen
were as fine targets as they had ever been. It
v/as a field day for the grandstand snipers.
It could have been worse. As it was, Rally
Committee and a helping block of both frosh
and upper classmen were hard pressed to pre
vent a minor riot.
Stanford women in the stands, who had
greeted the initial steps of the egg-and-tomato
blitzkrieg with glee, in several instances found
themselves perched in the middle of what might
have become the battle line.
As it was, the frosh hied themselves back to
Encina to remove the stains. Egg-flecked "inno
cent spectators" in the stands did the same.
Such was the sum total of the damage.
None but the most ardent moralizer and fin
ger-shaker could find a case for soap-box ora
tion on the subject of egg throwing. An aged
egg is a marvelous missile. It fits into the
throwing hand as though laid to order; its
parabola through the air is beautiful to watch;
the final results are spectacular to the nth de
gree.
But a Stanford rally is not the place for egg
throwing.
Any organization, and in particular a Univer
sity which has just claim to a high place in the
scholastic sun, finds to its dismay that its repu
tation is as strong as its weakest link. Every
schoolboy has sputtered Marc Antony's famous
". . . the evil that men do lives after them . .
lines. The egg-thrower is merely adding the
"so let it be with Stanford."
For this reason Men's Council yesterday is
sued warning that egg-throwers would not
be welcome at Thursday's frolic. They were
speaking, not to the student body as a whole,
but to those few who still do not realize what
unfavorable publicity can mean.
The greatest damage from last year's near
battle came not from the egg-tossing . . . but
from the mud-slinging. The mud was tossed
about when newspaper readers found the in
cident in their feature columns. To some of
these readers the item presented a picture of
the Farm that will prove difficult to erase.
A little mud can spatter a long way exactly
as a few egg-armed students can spatter a lot
of yolk.
These few have traditionally been among
the spectators in the stands. The frosh have
always played ball.
And what the heck, when you get down to it
a rally's a rally, and not the spot for a brawl.—

SHAGGY relic of the old days when the title
"Stanford Rough" was decidedly no mere
slang term and when frosh and second-year
men bucolicly pummeled each other in cheerful
class struggles, was last year's pajamarino rally
before the U.S.C. game.
Last year's pavilion program accidentally in
cluded a minor throwback to the days when.
The more realistic weapons of the days of the
plug-ugly were simulated with ripe eggs and
riper tomatoes, but the night-shirted freshmen
were as fine targets as they had ever been. It
v/as a field day for the grandstand snipers.
It could have been worse. As it was, Rally
Committee and a helping block of both frosh
and upper classmen were hard pressed to pre
vent a minor riot.
Stanford women in the stands, who had
greeted the initial steps of the egg-and-tomato
blitzkrieg with glee, in several instances found
themselves perched in the middle of what might
have become the battle line.
As it was, the frosh hied themselves back to
Encina to remove the stains. Egg-flecked "inno
cent spectators" in the stands did the same.
Such was the sum total of the damage.
None but the most ardent moralizer and fin
ger-shaker could find a case for soap-box ora
tion on the subject of egg throwing. An aged
egg is a marvelous missile. It fits into the
throwing hand as though laid to order; its
parabola through the air is beautiful to watch;
the final results are spectacular to the nth de
gree.
But a Stanford rally is not the place for egg
throwing.
Any organization, and in particular a Univer
sity which has just claim to a high place in the
scholastic sun, finds to its dismay that its repu
tation is as strong as its weakest link. Every
schoolboy has sputtered Marc Antony's famous
". . . the evil that men do lives after them . .
lines. The egg-thrower is merely adding the
"so let it be with Stanford."
For this reason Men's Council yesterday is
sued warning that egg-throwers would not
be welcome at Thursday's frolic. They were
speaking, not to the student body as a whole,
but to those few who still do not realize what
unfavorable publicity can mean.
The greatest damage from last year's near
battle came not from the egg-tossing . . . but
from the mud-slinging. The mud was tossed
about when newspaper readers found the in
cident in their feature columns. To some of
these readers the item presented a picture of
the Farm that will prove difficult to erase.
