# "See Ya, Skinny!"

AMAZED at The Daily tradition of a coke
party following staff meeting, new mem
bers will leg it to the Shack this afternoon at
1:15 o'clock to see if it will happen again. Old
members, who may be on line for the part of

hosts, will listen to roll call from the outer
edges.
Edit board will meet at 1 o'clock sharp to ex
change old and new jokes. Scooter will preside
over staff meeting and lead the dirge for Hutch.
Come one, come all, come early.
