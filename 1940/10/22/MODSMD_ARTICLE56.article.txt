# BULL SESSION
## SO SHE HAD TO WALK HOME 
### BUD AMES 
r goes back to a little over a week ago, to a
Saturday afternoon. The scene: the St'anford sta
dium. Thousands of flush-faced alumni, plush par
ents, and unhappy ptomained children are pushing
each other around. You guessed it. The Santa Clara
game is over, and all those people are heading for
home.
And above that crowd, which would make "Brig
ham Young" look like a seminar class on a Sunday
outing, comes that voice, that voice, that horrible
voice. Its cry will ring down through ages to come,
ever bringing tears to the eyes of mothers every
where.
"X y mn prt! For uoptft sake, where is our car,
mamma? I think we parked it down this way."
"No, papa, it was up this way—up near that tree.
The one with the four leaves on the bottom branch."
"No, no, no. It's right near that green convertible."
"No, papa, it's down this way."
Above the noise of the crowd, above the hawking
cries of the peanut salesmen, above the grinding of
gears, a shot rings out. Mama staggers once, then
falls into the dust and is promptly run over by a Pack
ard 120 with white-wall tires and a special up-draft
carburetor.

TUST about the same thing—only sometimes worse—
•" happens every Saturday that Stanford has a home
game. Thousands (last year you counted 'em by two's
if there were any to count) upon thousands of eager
spectators rush their cars into the stadium parking
lot, and then fling their tired bodies into the sea of
humans surging into the stadium. In their haste to get
in on the "Coach Clark Shaughnessy" yell they forget
where they park their cars, both individually and col
lectively. Complicated, isn't it?
All they remember is, "I parked 'er near the tree,"
or "just opposite the second ticket booth and 98 paces
from the end of the stadium."
When the game is over, and the crowd begins to
thicken and to shove your mother-in-law into the
Orange-Crush stand, they never can quite remember
where they parked the old bus. All the trees look the
same and that green convertible has moved.
So they hitch-hike down 101 for a couple of "root
beers," and then come back after dark after every
body else has driven home. Only everybody else has
driven off for a couple of "root-beers" and has come
back after dark to do the same thing as they. So
everybody spends the night bumping into each other
in the dark."
"Hello, Charlie, what you doing here?"
A shot rings out.

A ND now for the constructive criticism. Why does
n't some campus organization donate a few little
crate-wood signs which will index the parking lot in
some alphabetical or numerical manner? These signs
could be tacked on the trees, and would last for years.
Requests for such a system have been numerous.
Several persons could turn out this extremely help
ful spectator-aid in a couple of hours. By their action
they would win the plaudits and sincex*e thanks of thou
sands of happy spectators who would then be able to
walk directly from the stadium to their car.
