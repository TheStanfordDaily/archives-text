## 'FIGHT FIRE WITH WATER' 
### 
r jpHE EDITOR, SIR:
'41's analysis of the reaction to the conscription
poll is an interesting one, but perhaps it does not com
pletely explain the main reason for the difference of
opinion among the classes. Perhaps it is not only the
difference in physical age that makes the lower class
men more eager to sacrifice their all for $21 a month.
What seems more significant to me is the difference in
mental age.
Fresh from high schools that have an abhorrence
of historical truth, the new students are willing to
accept anything the leaders of this country say with
out comment. They are willing to accept the theory
that it is necessary to fight fire with fire—fascism with
fascism, without once remembering that fire is usually
fought with water.
But after three years of "higher education" a few
students have come to realize that the last war was
not fought to "end wars" or to "save democracy."
They learned that the war, as Wilson himself admit
ted after the slaughter was over, was a war to pro
tect privileged interests and to grab more colonies.
They saw years of poverty and disillusionment that
were an aftermath of that war and they know that all
those problems facing us now cannot be solved by
going through all that insane destruction again.
Yours is not the only "thin cry," '41; there are mil
lions of others and they must be heard.
