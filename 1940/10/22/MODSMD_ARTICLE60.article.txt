# Music Makes Good Show Of Rooney, Garland Movie
## 
### 
"STRIKE UP TIIE BAND," with Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland, now
playing at the Fox Stanford Theater.
This is a pretty good picture. It isn't really a good picture, but there
aren't many good ones coming through these days. This is a good picture
in that it is amusing and makes the audience laugh.

This is a good picture
there is some good, loud music in
it. Most people like good, loud mu
sic. This is a good picture because
there are some good songs in it,
"Our Love Affair" in particular.
This is a good picture because
Mickey Rooney is in it. Even though
all the boys from around Beverly
Hills say that he is a cad, Mickey
seems to go over in all his pictures.
HIGH SCHOOL LOCALE
But the main reason why this is
a good picture is because it is the
story of a kid who goes to high
school. This gives the picture an in
teresting locale, from which hu
morous, human situations can easily
come.
It's fun to watch kids go to school
in the movies: to watch them in the
library studying, to watch them in
class having fun with a serious
teacher, to watch boys and girls fall
in love, and to watch them get in
and out of trouble. All this is highly
amusing to audiences. It makes them
remember.
STORY DISAPPOINTS
But really, this is not a good pic
ture. It is entertaining.
This is not a good picture because
the story, assuming that it makes a
certain amount of sense, is terrible.
It's no good because the picture
drags. Because of Mickey Rooney's
mother, who turns in the worst all
around performance of all time. Be
cause of a terrible ending, which
has gyrating stages, thousands of
singers, a bunch of bands—all of
which is topped off by someone haul
ing up the flag.
SAD BUT DISGUSTING
Also this is not a good picture be
cause of several scenes that are
supposed to be sad. These scenes
are not necessary. They didn't make
anyone sad. They're disgusting. Ev
eryone was having a pretty good
time, listening to the music, laughing
and feeling pretty good. But the
writers of the thing weren't satisfied
with this. They wanted to remind
the audience that life is not always
so gay and bright.
Furthermore, this is not a good
picture because Judy Garland is get
ting fat, and her expansion makes
you feel sorry for her. She has a
pretty voice, all right, but she is get
ting too fat.—Saroyan

and out of trouble. All this is highly
amusing to audiences. It makes them
remember.
STORY DISAPPOINTS
But really, this is not a good pic
ture. It is entertaining.
This is not a good picture because
the story, assuming that it makes a
certain amount of sense, is terrible.
It's no good because the picture
drags. Because of Mickey Rooney's
mother, who turns in the worst all
around performance of all time. Be
cause of a terrible ending, which
has gyrating stages, thousands of
singers, a bunch of bands—all of
which is topped off by someone haul
ing up the flag.
SAD BUT DISGUSTING
Also this is not a good picture be
cause of several scenes that are
supposed to be sad. These scenes
are not necessary. They didn't make
anyone sad. They're disgusting. Ev
eryone was having a pretty good
time, listening to the music, laughing
and feeling pretty good. But the
writers of the thing weren't satisfied
with this. They wanted to remind
the audience that life is not always
so gay and bright.
Furthermore, this is not a good
picture because Judy Garland is get
ting fat, and her expansion makes
you feel sorry for her. She has a
pretty voice, all right, but she is get
ting too fat.—Saroyan
"STRIKE UP TIIE BAND," with Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland, now
playing at the Fox Stanford Theater.
This is a pretty good picture. It isn't really a good picture, but there
aren't many good ones coming through these days. This is a good picture
in that it is amusing and makes the audience laugh.

This is a good picture
there is some good, loud music in
it. Most people like good, loud mu
sic. This is a good picture because
there are some good songs in it,
"Our Love Affair" in particular.
This is a good picture because
Mickey Rooney is in it. Even though
all the boys from around Beverly
Hills say that he is a cad, Mickey
seems to go over in all his pictures.
HIGH SCHOOL LOCALE
But the main reason why this is
a good picture is because it is the
story of a kid who goes to high
school. This gives the picture an in
teresting locale, from which hu
morous, human situations can easily
come.
It's fun to watch kids go to school
in the movies: to watch them in the
library studying, to watch them in
class having fun with a serious
teacher, to watch boys and girls fall
in love, and to watch them get in
and out of trouble. All this is highly
amusing to audiences. It makes them
remember.
