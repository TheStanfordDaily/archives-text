BALANCED PROGRAM

The opening of the Concert Series
is in itself always an event of im
portance to the Farm, but Mr. Menu
hin's presence makes the occasion
doubly outstanding. Fresh from
triumphs in New York, San Fran
cisco, Boston, and pre-war London,
Rome, and Paris, Yehudi Menuhin
will bring Stanford students tomor
row night something of the genius
and extraordinary technique that has
won him unqualified acclaim since
he first began his career.
The program is a well balanced
combination of classical and semi
classical works. Works by Bach and
Paganini will afford the Stanford
audience an opportunity to hear the
difficult technical feats at which Mr.
Menuhin is so adept and which are
an integral part of his genius.
SEMI-CLASSICAL MUSIC

In a lighter vein, several selec
tions by Kreisler which are ever
welcome on any concert program
will be heard. Thus interpretation
and technique will be equally rep
resented.

Elinor Hall, Concert Series man
ager, has requested that those who
have purchased season tickets pick
them up at the Series office in Old
Union before the performance to
morrow night.
