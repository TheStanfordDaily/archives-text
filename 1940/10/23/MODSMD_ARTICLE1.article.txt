### BOB LOW 
JJOROTHY THOMPSON, wife of
the novelist Sinclair Lewis, has
been a columnist for the New York
Herald-Tribune since March, 1933.
With eight years spent abroad as a
foreign correspondent and as head
of an important news bureau, Miss
Thompson deserves her reputation
as one of the best qualified com
mentators in the newspaper field.
Something of the popularity of her
column may be estimated by its
potential readership—7,sss,ooo sub
scribers to 196 American newspa
pers.
The Herald-Tribune for years has
been one of the staunch Republican
newspapers of the American press.
It has missed few opportunities to
take a crack at the Roosevelt Ad
ministration, although lately it has
supported the President's foreign
policy.
On October 8, Miss Thompson
wrote that she favored President
Roosevelt's re-election, writing that
she had "waited, and watched the
campaign, read the speeches and
statements and watched the course
of events and kept an open mind."
Editors of the Tribune recognize
that the great preponderance of
Tribune readers are ardent Re
publicans who like to read a Re
publican newspaper. Miss Thomp
son's stand did not please them —
either editors or readers.

| AST Monday, Tribune readers
did not find Miss Thompson's col
umn, "On the Record," in its usual
place, but found in its stead the fol
lowing explanation:
"Miss Thompson's article for
publication Monday mornig was
devoted to an incomplete and in
conclusive discussion of the Axis
powers' attitude toward the
American Presidential election.
Taken by itself, it seemed to the
editor of the Herald-Tribune to
be misleading, tending to inject
into the campaign an un-American
issue. The article was therefore
withheld from publication pend
ing the full development of Miss
Thompson's views."
No further statement concei-ning
the article appeared in the paper.
Several days later the Democratic
National Committee attempted to
buy advertising space in the. Trib
une in which to publish Miss
.Thompson's "un-American" column.
The advertisement was refused.
This is not the first time a news
paper has refused to print material
that did not fall in with its editorial
policy, but it became a conspicuous
instance when it was drawn to the
nation's attention by a statement
from Edward J. Flynn, chairman of
the Democratic National Committee,
at a press conference last week.
What Miss Thompson wrote was
merely that she thought that the
Axis leaders wished to see Roose
velt defeated in the election. She
did not infer that Willkie himself
was in any way to blame for this
alleged attitude on the part of Mus
solini and Hitler.

| I ERTAINLY freedom of expres
sion does not exist within a
newspaper that censors its colum
nists in such a fashion. The federal
government by the first amendment,
and the state governments by simi
lar constitutional limitations, can
not restrain or censor before publi
cation.
But here is an instance of cen
sorship prior to publication by the
newspaper itself. It is a matter
over which government has no
jurisdiction, since technically there
has been no abridgment of free
dom of the press.
For four years Miss Thompson ex
pressed her opinions in the columns
of the Tribune. Abruptly her opin
ion was not considered worthy of
publication.
Where facts can not be deter
mined conslusively, opinions—cer-
tainly if clearly labeled as such, as
in the present case—must be pre
sented if the public is to be in
formed.
Editors in 195 American news
papers evidently thought so when
they published Miss Thompson's
article in spite of the Tribune's re
fusal to do so.

newspaper itself. It is a matter
over which government has no
jurisdiction, since technically there
has been no abridgment of free

For four years Miss Thompson ex
pressed her opinions in the columns
of the Tribune. Abruptly her opin
ion was not considered worthy of
publication.
Where facts can not be deter
mined conslusively, opinions—cer-
tainly if clearly labeled as such, as
in the present case—must be pre
sented if the public is to be in
formed.
Editors in 195 American news
papers evidently thought so when
they published Miss Thompson's
article in spite of the Tribune's re
fusal to do so.
