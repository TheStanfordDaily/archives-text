# Board Posts Draft List In Palo Alto
## Stanford's District Surpasses Expected Number of Enrollees 
### 
Names and numbers of 4,355 per- !
ions were posted yesterday at the
Palo Alto Selective Service Head- (
fjuartcrs. Of these, some 1,100 were
the names and registration serial ,
numbers of Stanford men registered
a week ago today among more than j
lfi million other men in America
between the ages of 21 and 35.
Representatives of the Palo Alto '
district board, No. 112, stated that !
ihe total far exceeded expectations
For this area, comprising Stanford,
Palo Alto proper, Monlo Park, May
field, Los Altos, and as far south
on the highway as Mountain View.
Though these numbers are posted j
at the board office, 514 Bryant
Street upstairs, it was emphasized
that it is not necessary for regis
trants to have this number on their
cards.
STIMSON DRAWS
At noon, Oct. 29, Secretary of War
Henry L. Stimson will draw the first
capsule from the 7,500 in the large
fish bowl in the Interdepartmental
Auditorium in Washington. Follow
ing this ceremony, at which Presi
dent Roosevelt will give a short
speech, other high-ranking officials
will pick the next few numbers.
The numbers at the Palo Alto
Board run from 1 to 4,355 and in
other boards to as high as 7,500.
To use an imaginary number, Sec
retary Stimson may draw number
1,735. All holders of this number
from each of the draft boards (which
registered more than 7,735 men)
throughout the country will be
mailed their classification blanks
and, if they are not deferred, they
will be the first to be called to the
army for their year's service.
CHANGE OF ADDRESS
The Palo Alto board emphasized
the necessity of every local regis
trant's keeping in close contact with
the board and advising them imme
diately of any change in address.
It was also stated that, though
registration numbers are posted, it is
not necessary for the registrant to
have this number or do anything else
until he receives his classification
blank, providing he stays at the
same address as given to the regis
trar.
First local classification blanks
will probably not be mailed until
several days after the initial draw
ing. These blanks must be returned
to the local board within five days
after receipt.
It has been estimated that the first
contingent of approximately 30,000
draftees will be on their way to
camp within three weeks after Sec
retary Stimson draws the first blue
capsule from the fishbowl.
