# Ex Committee Slates Lecture By van Paassen
## Changes Suggested In Cardinals By-laws, Appointment Set-up 
### M. J. MONTGOMERY 
Pierre van Paassen, whose best
seller Days of Our Years predicted
so much contemporary history in
the European conflict, will address
a Stanford audience Feb. 20,
Ex Committee decided last night
to present the author in a single
A.S.S.U. - sponsored lecture, and
recommended at the same time that
students should be admitted at a
reduced admission price.
CARDINALS: Anne Townsend
presented two recommendations
from her committee on the Cardinals
controversy. First, that the cum
bersome by-law affecting a dis
agreement between Cardinals and
Ex Committee be amended to read:
"The minutes of the Stanford Car
dinals shall go to the Executive
Committee for approval. In case of
disapproval of any action, the deci
sion of Executive Committee must
prevail."
Secondly, the committee recom
mended changes in the much-criti
cized appintment set - up. They
suggested interviews be held and
following the interviews, two nomi
nees for every open position on Car
dinals be presented to a joint meet
ing of Cardinals and the Executive
Committee for election. A special
provision for two nominees from
the floor was included.
These revisions will be phrased
by Dean Kirkwood of the law school
this week, and the committee will
act on the amendments at the next
meeting.
FOOTBALL PICTURES: Every
Thursday at 4:15 o'clock moving
pictures of the previous Saturday's
game will be shown in the Educa
tion auditoriumâ€”admission free.
STANDING COMMITTEES: Syl
via Berry and Ross Anderson were
named by Chairman Bruce Jessup
to give special consideration to all
minutes and appointments subject to
Ex Committee's approval.
Because Dr. Wilbur is referring
all requests for campus drives to
John Porter's student-faculty com
mittee, it becomes a standing com
mittee to serve this purpose.
STUDENT BODY CARDS: After
much discussion regarding ihc
transfer of student body cards for
football games, it was left to Bruce
j Jessup to present the views of the
j committee to ihc B.A.C. No final
conclusion was reached.
OFF-CAMPUS AFFAIRS: Alum
ni-sponsored functions participated
in by campus units were considered,
I and decision was postponed.
