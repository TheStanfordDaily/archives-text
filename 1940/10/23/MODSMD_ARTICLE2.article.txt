# Japan Hints At Alliance With Britain
## 'Escape' Clause Seen In Nipponese—Axis Mutual Aid Treaty 
### 
SHANGHAI, Wednesday, Oct
23 (UP). —Informants with ex
cellent British connections told
the United States today the Japa
nese have informed British Am
bassador Sir Robert L. Craigie
in Tokyo the alliance among Ja
pan. Germany and Italy has a
secret escape clause permitting
each signatory to decide the con
ditions under which it will come
to the aid of the others in event
they are attacked.
The informants said the Japanese
were attempting to convince Sir
Robert that further British efforts
to come to an agreement with Japan
are no useless but they believed so
far the British are viewing the Japa
nese advances with considerable hes
itation.
ESCAPE CLAUSE
Under the alleged secret escape
clause, Japan would be free to de
cide what she would do in event the
United States should enter the Eu
ropean war while Italy and Ger
many would have equal freedom in
event Japan should become involved
with Britain and the United States
in the Pacific.
Several high diplomats in Tokyo
have told their home governments
during the last week Japan's reac
tion to growing British-American
solidarity in the Far East indi
cates the Japanese feel they have
lost the initiative in the Pacific
and will delay any plans they may
have had for early action in the
Netherlands East Indies and else
where in new areas of Southeast
Asia.
There was a growing impression
among diplomats in Tokyo that Italy
and Germany hoped the published
terms of the alliance would divert
British and American attention to
the Pacific Ocean while the Japanese
hoped they would prevent a joint
British-American stand in the Pa
cific.
