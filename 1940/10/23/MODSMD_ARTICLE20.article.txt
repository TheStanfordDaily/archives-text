# Nagel Orchestra to Play For Stanford's Second Annual Big Game Dance
## Cardinals to Meet Tonight to Decide Price of Tickets 
### 
Cardinals rang lip another tra
dition to Stanford's credit last
night when it announced the sign
ing of Freddy Nagel and his
orchestra for the second annual
Big Game Dancc.
Signing of the contract locks this
year's repeat performance of the
dance in the Farm's closet of tra
ditions, making it a certainty.
Although last year's inaugural Big
Game Dance was considered a huge
success, with over 500 couples in
attendance, it was not certain the
event would take an encore this
season.
The affair will be held at the fash
ionable San Francisco Golf Club
Big Game night, November 30, from
10 to 2, according to Cardinal Jess
Hazlett, who signed the orchestra.
UNDECIDED PLANS
Price of the bids, $5 last year,
has not yet been fixed, nor has it
been decided whether the dancc
will be formal or informal. Car
dinals will meet tonight to complete
these details.
Cardinal Bob Beckham is in
charge of refreshments and deco
rations.
Big Game Dance was inaugurated
last year at the behest of Larry
Livingston, Daily editor, as a i-ea
sonably priced means of entertain
ment for Stanford men and women.
THE SOLUTTION
Student leaders felt the prices
charged at most entertainment spots
in the city Big Game night were out
of reach of the average student, and
hit upon the dance as the logical
solution.
Contrasted with last year's sensa
tional last-minute signing of Jimmy
Grier, which pulled the embryonic
Big Game Dance out of the fire just
as it was about to flop in committee
men's hands, this year's affair has
been carefully planned and already
a large crowd is predicted.
