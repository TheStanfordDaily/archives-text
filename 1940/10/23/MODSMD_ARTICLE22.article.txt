# Thespians To Perform For forum
## 'Mr. Congressman' To Be Played Again Here This Weed-end 
### 
Excellence of Stanford's summer
presentation of "Mr. Congressman"
i.s not only to be measured by its
repeat performance this week, Fri
day and Saturday, but also by the
invitation of the Oakland Forum for
a special performance before that |
body Monday, Nov. 18, at the Oak- j
land City Club Theater.
Members of the forum were eager ]
to have the Stanford Players per
form for them, and upon seeing the j
Pearson play this summer they |
chose it for its timeliness and its J
comedy treatment.
WAS 'MERRY-GO-ROUND*
"Mr. Congressman" was originally |
Written under the title, "Merry-Go- 1
Pound" by Leon Pearson, brother of
Drew Pearson of "Washington j
Merry-Go-Round" fame. F. Cowles j
Strickland, director of the present j
play, first presented it in its orig- j
inal form in Washington, D.C. The 1
play then had 17 scenes and needed j
.100 actors to complete the cast.
Rewriting of the play was neces- j
s:iry because the original plot proved j
interesting and entertaining only to j
Washington audiences due to the J
factual background of the plot j
which reproduced actual events in j
the political scene.
CONGRESSMAN FROM GEORGIA
Sam Anders, leading role of the
play, represents a Congressman j
from the 13th district in Georgia <
(there are really only 12 districts
there) who runs against difficulties
in re-election when he is confronted
by the New Deal. Actually there
was a congressman from the South
who was purged by the New Deal.
Another factual episode written
into the play was that of a con
gressman's son accepting a bribe to
West Point.
Leon Pearson, author, is a Wash
ington correspondent representing a
chain of South American newspa
pers. He was present at the Golden
Gate Exposition opening of the
Brazilian Pavilion. On his way to
Treasure Island, Mr. Pearson came
through Mexico, interviewing Diego
Rivera while he was there.
While in Mexico, Mr. Pearson re
ported the actual situation of Com
munism down there. He was one of
the last American reporters to inter
view Leon Trotsky.
"Mr. Congressman" is not included
on the season ticket because of its
previous presentation on the cam
pus. Tickets are 50 cents each and
amy be obtained at the box office of
the Little Theater, or by calling Mr.
Barker at P.A. 22041.

Excellence of Stanford's summer
presentation of "Mr. Congressman"
i.s not only to be measured by its
repeat performance this week, Fri
day and Saturday, but also by the
invitation of the Oakland Forum for
a special performance before that |
body Monday, Nov. 18, at the Oak- j
land City Club Theater.

form for them, and upon seeing the j

chose it for its timeliness and its J
comedy treatment.
WAS 'MERRY-GO-ROUND*
"Mr. Congressman" was originally |
Written under the title, "Merry-Go- 1
Pound" by Leon Pearson, brother of
Drew Pearson of "Washington j
Merry-Go-Round" fame. F. Cowles j
Strickland, director of the present j
play, first presented it in its orig- j
inal form in Washington, D.C. The 1
play then had 17 scenes and needed j
.100 actors to complete the cast.
Rewriting of the play was neces- j
s:iry because the original plot proved j
interesting and entertaining only to j
Washington audiences due to the J
factual background of the plot j
which reproduced actual events in j
the political scene.

play, represents a Congressman j

Another factual episode written
into the play was that of a con
gressman's son accepting a bribe to
West Point.
