# British Drive German Planes Back Across English Channel
## 
### 
LONDON, Wed., Oct. 2!5 (UP). —A wall of shellfire and British "night
hawk" fighters reinforced by new American planes last night strangled
the fury of Adolf Hitler's a siege of London. All-clear signals sounded
shortly before midnight.
It was perhaps the quietest of London's 46 nights of assault but about

a.m. air raid sirens started shriek
ing again.
Another all-clear came again a
half hour later without any bombs
j having been dropped on London and
| no sound of shellfire.
Several houses in an industrial
j town of the midlands were demol
j ished by bombs which smashed upon
) the suburbs and other bombs and
. incendiaries fell in South Wales.
Only a handful of raiders suc
i ceeded in reaching the capital after
I a day of sharply-reduced enemy at-
J tacks all over the British Isles.
Three of the relatively few bombs
j falling in London after nightfall
hit and damaged a well known
j store, the windows of which had
been shattered in a recent raid.
BOMBS IN WEST
A number of bombs were dropped
j on a town in the west midlands,
| damaging the police station and
j some shops. Some persons were be
i lieved trapped in a hotel and a
t public shelter.
The British admitted six planes
| destroyed over England to three
j German planes.
It was the first time British losses
J had been twice as great as those of
j Germany in reports here. Authori
, ties have attached considerable sig
i nificanee to the recent use of fight
! ers and light bombers with greater
j combat power than of the heavy
| bombers, as well as the practice of
j sending planes over singly or in
j small groups rather than in forma
' tions.
Raiders were reported over Liv
erpool. which had taken a heavy
| drubbing in the previous night, as
! saults, and over another town in
i the northwest.
100 PLANES FIGHT
Reports from Folkestone told of
! one of the most furious air battles of
J the war along the southeast coast,
! "graveyard of German raiders," with
more than 100 planes participating.
Observers said the whine of strain
ing motors and the chatter of ma
j chine guns was so intense it drowned
; out the explosions of bombs jetti
' soned by the Germans to facilitate
their escape.
Four of the Geiman planes were
said to have been shot down.
Our teeth chatter because cold
! often causes a spasm of shivering
I which the brain canwot control.

LONDON, Wed., Oct. 2!5 (UP). —A wall of shellfire and British "night
hawk" fighters reinforced by new American planes last night strangled
the fury of Adolf Hitler's a siege of London. All-clear signals sounded
shortly before midnight.
It was perhaps the quietest of London's 46 nights of assault but about

a.m. air raid sirens started shriek
ing again.
Another all-clear came again a
half hour later without any bombs
j having been dropped on London and
| no sound of shellfire.
Several houses in an industrial
j town of the midlands were demol
j ished by bombs which smashed upon
) the suburbs and other bombs and
. incendiaries fell in South Wales.
Only a handful of raiders suc
i ceeded in reaching the capital after
I a day of sharply-reduced enemy at-
J tacks all over the British Isles.
Three of the relatively few bombs
j falling in London after nightfall
hit and damaged a well known
j store, the windows of which had
been shattered in a recent raid.
BOMBS IN WEST
A number of bombs were dropped
j on a town in the west midlands,
| damaging the police station and
j some shops. Some persons were be
i lieved trapped in a hotel and a
t public shelter.
The British admitted six planes
| destroyed over England to three
