# Vultures' Life Cycles Outlined

### BARBARA BADGER 
Most of us are familiar with the
black buzzard—it's a very common
bird. Yet two Stanford students are
the first to record photographically
its life history.
Telford Work and Albeit Wool,
working under the direction of Dr.
Willis H. Rich of the Natural His
tory Department, last April dis
covered a nest containing two vul
ture eggs. This discovery, and the
work related to it, is considered so
important, scientifically, that when
their treatise is finished they will

be the accepted authorities on the '
buzzard, or in Work's words, "since |
we've been working with it we call
it the Turkey Vulture, or Cathartes j
aura septentrionalis."
START IN SPRING
It all started last spring when |
Work and Wool were working to- j
gether on a special problems course I
in ornithology, which took them !
about 15 miles northeast of San !
Jose. About a mile and a half from !
their car, they saw an adult vul- j
ture flush from a cave in the cliff j
above them.
In the cave they found a pit nine
feet deep, and with the aid of a
flashlight they were able to see two
vulture eggs. When tested—"can- ;
dling" is the term—these proved to
be fresh. Wool and Work are the
first ever to see a new-laid vul
! ture egg.
GOOD LUCK
Experts had calculated that the
i eggs took from 30 to 40 days to
j hatch. The young ornithologists,
| basing their calculations on their
1 own judgment, made the eight-hour
j round-trip again in exactly 31 days,
| Luck was with them: when Wool
went into the cave Work, on the
outside, heard him let loose a "glee
ful string of profanity." One egg
was hatched, another pipped, and
j the mother was in the cave.
In nature photographs, everything
must be taken just as it is. But
I besides the fact that Work, who
j took the pictures, had to lie flat
| on his stomach in the black cave to
j get the shots, the whole task was
j made more unpleasant because the
vulture's only means of defense is
i regurgitation.
"And it's pretty effective," Wool
| said.
BIG JOB
After a few visits the little birds
grew used to them. The young vul
tures wore so clumsy that it took
the two students an hour and a half
to weigh them.
"Two naturalists never had a
| more exasperating job. We just
about went fruit trying to weigh
those infant vultui'es on a balance,"
| Work commented.
On the last trip, two months and
two days after hatching, the two
were there to record the first flight
of the young birds.

above them.
In the cave they found a pit nine
feet deep, and with the aid of a
flashlight they were able to see two
vulture eggs. When tested—"can- ;
dling" is the term—these proved to
be fresh. Wool and Work are the
first ever to see a new-laid vul
! ture egg.
GOOD LUCK
Experts had calculated that the
i eggs took from 30 to 40 days to
j hatch. The young ornithologists,
| basing their calculations on their
1 own judgment, made the eight-hour
j round-trip again in exactly 31 days,
| Luck was with them: when Wool
went into the cave Work, on the
outside, heard him let loose a "glee
ful string of profanity." One egg
was hatched, another pipped, and
j the mother was in the cave.
In nature photographs, everything
must be taken just as it is. But
I besides the fact that Work, who
j took the pictures, had to lie flat
| on his stomach in the black cave to
j get the shots, the whole task was
j made more unpleasant because the
vulture's only means of defense is
i regurgitation.
"And it's pretty effective," Wool
| said.
BIG JOB
After a few visits the little birds
grew used to them. The young vul
tures wore so clumsy that it took
the two students an hour and a half
to weigh them.
"Two naturalists never had a
| more exasperating job. We just
about went fruit trying to weigh
those infant vultui'es on a balance,"
| Work commented.
On the last trip, two months and
two days after hatching, the two
were there to record the first flight
of the young birds.
Most of us are familiar with the
black buzzard—it's a very common
bird. Yet two Stanford students are
the first to record photographically
its life history.
Telford Work and Albeit Wool,
working under the direction of Dr.
Willis H. Rich of the Natural His
tory Department, last April dis
covered a nest containing two vul
ture eggs. This discovery, and the
work related to it, is considered so
important, scientifically, that when
their treatise is finished they will

be the accepted authorities on the '
buzzard, or in Work's words, "since |
we've been working with it we call
it the Turkey Vulture, or Cathartes j
aura septentrionalis."
START IN SPRING
It all started last spring when |
Work and Wool were working to- j
gether on a special problems course I
in ornithology, which took them !
about 15 miles northeast of San !
Jose. About a mile and a half from !
their car, they saw an adult vul- j
ture flush from a cave in the cliff j
above them.
In the cave they found a pit nine
