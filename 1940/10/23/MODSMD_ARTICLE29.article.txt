# Graham Stuart Cites Policies
## Professor Discusses Southern Relations 
### 
Speaking yesterday before an
open meeting of the International j
Relations Club, Graham Stuart,
professor in the political science de- |
partment, discussed America's cur
rent Pan-American policy.
According to Dr. Stuart, public
opposition to the heretofore "one- |
way" Good Neighbor policy in both j
North and South America has great- i
ly diminished as a result of recent
developments, notably Mexico's i
agreement not to sell scrap iron to
Japan.
IMPERIALISM COMBATTED
The United States has also done its
part in overcoming South and Cen- j
tral American antagonism to
"Yankee imperialism." In the last
few years we have scrapped the j
treaty allowing intervention in
j Cuba; we have paid our debt to Pa
: nama in full; and we have volun
j tarily renounced our right to con
; trol finances in the Dominican Re- 1
public.
| Relations among the nations of j
â–  the Western Hemisphere are now
i founded on a sounder basis than
I ever before, Dr. Stuart declared. In
J addition to a more "friendly feeling',
1 there is the added stimulus of a
| common outside danger threatening
all American countries. Since the
fall of The Netherlands and France,
j America has feared that the con
querors may try to take over islands
belonging to theni, and has taken
j concerted action to preclude such a
| possibility.
COMMITTEE SET UP
A committee of 21 nations has
been set up to administer provision-
J ally any territory threatened by in
vasion, and any one country may
| assume this duty temporarily until
i the committee can go into effect.
In conclusion, Dr. Stuart stated
that mutual observance of the cur
rent policies of non-aggression, non
intervention, and recognition of
treaties are forming the basis for
closer co-operation in Pan-America.
