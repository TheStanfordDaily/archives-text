line Stanford representatives to the j
seventh America Japan Student !
Conference, held during the summer ;
n Japan, with side trip.-, into Korea i
>nd Manchukuo. Graham Stuart, ;

Roy Vitousek, second to speak and 1
ntroduced by Hugh O'Donnell, de- 1
,'lared that Americans wouldn't find
•onditions "acceptable" and talked
n easy fashion of what he called the j
small things. v
Commenting on the essential dif- j
erences between Japanese and j
American motivation. Vitousek listed ;
Ihe Nippon's fear of "losing face," his j
hewing to the line, and his inability ;
to comprehend American freedom as j
instrumental in the mutual failure j
of understanding.
GUERILLA TROUBLE
Wartime sacrifices in Japan were
discussed by Nod Pugh, who was
chairman of the entire American
delegation. Gasoline rations, short
ages in food, and the stringent ef
fort to provide for the army in Man
chukuo and China have brought
about great ingenuity in belt tight
ening, he announced.
"Another point in the struggle is
the trouble the Japanese have had
in keeping the countryside they
have conquered," he continued.
"They hold the key cities, but can't
venture outside the walls because of
dangers from skillful Chinese gue
rilla warfare," he said.
To interpret the 1940 Japanese,
Kay Kitagawa cited a background
of Buddhist philosophy, Confucian
ism, the Shinto ideal, and the tra
dition of bushido, feudal code of
chivalry, which allows a Japanese
to assert "from his heart that he
doesn't hate the Chinese."
FAR EAST DOCTRINE
"It seems like hypocrisy," Kita
gawa said, "but the Japanese are
moving—with glaring idiosyncrasies,
perhaps, and pitfalls—to establish a
Monroe Doctrine of the Far East
with common benefits for all."
A kaleidescope of friends, not of
"babies, smells, and bicycles," pro
vided Eill Turner with the means of
demonstrating the regimented ap
pearance, and the "regimented
thought."
Some campuses sell their parking
spaces near classrooms.

small things. v
Commenting on the essential dif- j
erences between Japanese and j
American motivation. Vitousek listed ;
Ihe Nippon's fear of "losing face," his j
hewing to the line, and his inability ;
to comprehend American freedom as j
instrumental in the mutual failure j
of understanding.
GUERILLA TROUBLE
Wartime sacrifices in Japan were
discussed by Nod Pugh, who was
chairman of the entire American
delegation. Gasoline rations, short
ages in food, and the stringent ef
fort to provide for the army in Man
chukuo and China have brought
about great ingenuity in belt tight
ening, he announced.
"Another point in the struggle is
the trouble the Japanese have had
in keeping the countryside they
have conquered," he continued.
"They hold the key cities, but can't
venture outside the walls because of
dangers from skillful Chinese gue
rilla warfare," he said.
To interpret the 1940 Japanese,
Kay Kitagawa cited a background
of Buddhist philosophy, Confucian
ism, the Shinto ideal, and the tra
dition of bushido, feudal code of
chivalry, which allows a Japanese
to assert "from his heart that he
doesn't hate the Chinese."
FAR EAST DOCTRINE
"It seems like hypocrisy," Kita
gawa said, "but the Japanese are
moving—with glaring idiosyncrasies,
perhaps, and pitfalls—to establish a
Monroe Doctrine of the Far East
with common benefits for all."
A kaleidescope of friends, not of
"babies, smells, and bicycles," pro

Six Stanford Students looked at Japan for the benefit of 500 persons in
