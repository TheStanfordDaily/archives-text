# jinx Wakes; Takes Swing At Warnecke
## 
### 
The injury jinx which has haunted
Stanford's football teams for the past
few years but which has been con
spicuous by its absence so far this
season struck yesterday at one of
the most crucial points of the sea
son and at one of Coach Clark
Shaughnessy's key men.
Its victim was first-stringer Rod
Warnecke, towering 6-4 tackle.
Weekly scrimmage had been under
way for scarcely five minutes before
Rod injured his shoulder. He was
removed, immediately the Palo
Alto Hospital for heat treatments
and a lew X-rays.
According to Dr. Paul Davies,
team doctor, Warnecke's chances of
seeing action against the invading
Trojans Saturday will not be cer
tain until the X-rays are observed
today. However, Davies seemed
fairly optimistic and felt that the
rangy tackle might be able to per
form with some sort of device on his
arm similar to the one his running
mate Bruno Banducci wears.
CANCELS SCRUM
This injury caused Conch Shaugh
nessy to discontinue scrimmage im
mediately and the head man sent
lii.s varsity back to running signals
on offense and practicing their eVer
changing defensive formations; this
week they're styled to stop the sheer
power and short passes of Howard
Jones' Thundering Herd.
Assistant Coach Husky Hunt's
.squad of reserves imitated Peoples,
Banta, and Co., throwing against the
Card first and second strings the
U.S.C. plays they have been learning
the past few days.
TROY POWERS
Although Troy is supposed to be
mainly a power team featuring the
charge of such giant linemen as 200-
pound Ed Dempsey at center, 232-
pound Ben Sohn at guard, and ?10-
pound Bob deLauer tackle, plus the
smashing ball carrying of the two
fullbacks, Bob Peoples and Jack
Banta, they still have a fairly potent
passing attack.
With Peoples and sub backs Ray
Wood and Frank Swirles doing the
passing and with such pass snaggers
as Rose Bowl hero Al Kreugar and
basketball's former Tom "Bad Boy"
McGarvin doing the catching, the
Trojans hope to match Frankie Al
berts pitching arm for gaining yards
through the air Saturday.
LATE PRACTICE
The rest of the Indian squad
which labored under the arc lights
until after 7 o'clock last night, rush
ing their preparations for the crucial
U.S.C. game, seemed healthy enough.
Ray Hammett was back in a suit and
operating at full steam, and hefty
Hank Norberg showed that his in
jured shoulder is no longer bother
ing him by his crashing defensive
play during the few short minutes
of scrimmage.
However, Clyde Jeffrey, though in
a uniform , »ery night, is still a
problem fcfj. .he team physicians.
The new styled shoes obtained for
the Card speed, burner have failed
to cure his persistent limp. Jeff has
either wrenched or dislocated in
some way the arch of one of his fly
ing feet and the soreness has been
hanging on for over a week now.
WILL OUTSCORE
Today's practice session promises
to be another long one for the In
dians. Because Shaughnessy's strat
egy for the week-end appears to out
score the undeniably powerful Tro
jans, there remains an awful lot of
work for the Cards on smoothing
over their offense if they are to gain
more yards and make more touch
downs than last year's national
champions.

Trojans Saturday will not be cer
tain until the X-rays are observed
today. However, Davies seemed
fairly optimistic and felt that the
rangy tackle might be able to per
form with some sort of device on his
arm similar to the one his running
mate Bruno Banducci wears.
CANCELS SCRUM
This injury caused Conch Shaugh
nessy to discontinue scrimmage im
mediately and the head man sent
lii.s varsity back to running signals
on offense and practicing their eVer
changing defensive formations; this
week they're styled to stop the sheer
power and short passes of Howard
Jones' Thundering Herd.
Assistant Coach Husky Hunt's
.squad of reserves imitated Peoples,
Banta, and Co., throwing against the
Card first and second strings the
U.S.C. plays they have been learning
the past few days.
TROY POWERS
Although Troy is supposed to be
mainly a power team featuring the
charge of such giant linemen as 200-
pound Ed Dempsey at center, 232-
pound Ben Sohn at guard, and ?10-
pound Bob deLauer tackle, plus the
smashing ball carrying of the two
fullbacks, Bob Peoples and Jack
Banta, they still have a fairly potent
passing attack.
With Peoples and sub backs Ray
Wood and Frank Swirles doing the
passing and with such pass snaggers
as Rose Bowl hero Al Kreugar and
basketball's former Tom "Bad Boy"
McGarvin doing the catching, the
Trojans hope to match Frankie Al
berts pitching arm for gaining yards
through the air Saturday.
LATE PRACTICE
The rest of the Indian squad
which labored under the arc lights
until after 7 o'clock last night, rush
ing their preparations for the crucial
U.S.C. game, seemed healthy enough.
Ray Hammett was back in a suit and
operating at full steam, and hefty
Hank Norberg showed that his in
jured shoulder is no longer bother
ing him by his crashing defensive
play during the few short minutes
of scrimmage.
However, Clyde Jeffrey, though in
a uniform , »ery night, is still a
problem fcfj. .he team physicians.
The new styled shoes obtained for
the Card speed, burner have failed
to cure his persistent limp. Jeff has
either wrenched or dislocated in
some way the arch of one of his fly
ing feet and the soreness has been
hanging on for over a week now.
WILL OUTSCORE
Today's practice session promises
to be another long one for the In
dians. Because Shaughnessy's strat
egy for the week-end appears to out
score the undeniably powerful Tro
jans, there remains an awful lot of
work for the Cards on smoothing
over their offense if they are to gain
more yards and make more touch
downs than last year's national
champions.
The injury jinx which has haunted
Stanford's football teams for the past
few years but which has been con
spicuous by its absence so far this
season struck yesterday at one of
the most crucial points of the sea
son and at one of Coach Clark
Shaughnessy's key men.
Its victim was first-stringer Rod
Warnecke, towering 6-4 tackle.
Weekly scrimmage had been under
way for scarcely five minutes before
Rod injured his shoulder. He was
removed, immediately the Palo
Alto Hospital for heat treatments
and a lew X-rays.
According to Dr. Paul Davies,
team doctor, Warnecke's chances of
seeing action against the invading
Trojans Saturday will not be cer
tain until the X-rays are observed
today. However, Davies seemed
fairly optimistic and felt that the
rangy tackle might be able to per
form with some sort of device on his
arm similar to the one his running
