# Frosh to Try 'T' Lineup Against U.S.C. Saturday
## 
### 
When Coach Harry Shtpkcy*s frosh gridders start to work on the
C.S.C. yearlings in the Stanford Stadium tliis Saturday, they are likely
to show the fans a flashy cifTense. Not that the spectators are unused to
it. for they have been watching the varsity run tliis same stuff all season,
hut it will he new as far as the frosh are concerned.

For this Saturday will probably
find the Papoose eleven unleashing |
their "T" formation attack in all its
glory for the first time this season.
True, they did run two plays from
the "T" against Modesto, but anyone I
who took their eyes from the game |
for a moment might have missed !
them.
DRILLS NEW DEFENSE
Shipkey sent his charges through
a long scrimmage last night with the :
new offense as the feature of the
drill. And, although some of the
boys had not completely learned all
their assignments as yet, they made
it look good, especially when you |
consider the fact that the defense
also knew the plays.
The passing from the "T"
also looked very potent as receivers
broke away from their defensive
men time and again. On the re
ceiving end of a number of the

tosses was Bill Wilson, an end who,
although he has been faid up with
injuries most of the season, looms as '
one of the better wingmen on the [
Papoose squad.
WORKOUT SESSION
With the third-stringers emulat- !
ing the Trobabes, the frosh will
probably go through a session on de- j
fense tonight. Assistant CoaCrt Bob
Dakan scouted the Cal Cub-Tro- j
babe clash at Berkeley last Saturday |
and brought back a stack of charts
on the offensive formations and plays !
used by the U.S.C. frosh that day.
From this information Shipkey
hopes to give his footballers a pretty
good idea of what they might cx- I
pect to be thrown their way this j
week-end.
Along with the defensive drill, the :
frosh will probably get a dose of j

pass offense, which was a little
neglected in favor of work on run
ning plays at yesterday's practice
session. Mitchell, Bob Koch, Joe
Mardesich, and Frank Forbes give
the Papooses an array of fine passers
that can give any team trouble.
So far this season Coach Shipkey
has made but few changes in his
starting line-ups from one game to
the next. And some of these were
made for psychological purposes, as
when he started several Los Angeles
boys, who hadn't been playing first

team, when the team played dowr
south.
