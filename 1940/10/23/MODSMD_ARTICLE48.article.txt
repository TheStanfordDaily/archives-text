# Somewhere in Switzerland

YOU in the United States are about to enter
upon "peacetime" military conscription. As
a Swiss soldier I can tell you of our system of
compulsory military training and how it affects
the individual in this democracy. When in Sep
tember a year ago it grew necessary for our
small peace-time army suddenly to expand to
its present strength of half a million men, the
groundwork had long been laid through our
system of military service.

A glance at Europe's map will indicate why
Switzerland originally adopted this system. Her
exposed position, together with her population
of only 4,000,000, made an inexpensive reserve
army essential. We Swiss, on reaching the age
of twenty, consider it natural to give several
months to military training, for such sacrifice
on our part coincides with our attainment of
political rights. We associate defense of Switz
erland with Swiss democracy. And democracy,
in Switzerland, has its roots in the army.
No family ties or university honors suffice to
give exemption from military service. We are
often told thai our Swiss army has a high esprit
de corps. Proof of it lies in our government's
decree that each soldier, when on leave, must
take his equipment, including his gun, with
him.

Recruiting school opened my eyes to the
composition of our Swiss population. As a law
student in university I had until then only a
vague conception of it. But on that spring morn
ing when I stood "somewhere in French Switz
erland" among a crowd of other young men
with newly shaven heads, too, in accordance
with our army regulations, I knew that a change
had come into my life. Bankers' sons, peasants'
sons, town-dwellers, and mountaineers, we
were all going to share the same physical exer
cises and military courses of instruction.

During those first months of military service,
bonds of real friendship were often forged.
Each man knew he was contributing toward that
liberty our ancestors had won. Student helped
peasant, whose hands were clumsy at holding
a pen, and peasant responded with welcome
aid at fatiguing manual tasks.
At the end of that initial period, we were each
incorporated into the regiment of our canton.
For active service we were destined to receive
forty-four cents a day. Today, thousands of
men, like myself, are "somewhere in Switzer
land" anxiously waiting for this war to end.
