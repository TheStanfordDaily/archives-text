# Bellwether on Butts
## 
### 
THE Bellwether presence on the libe steps
was in itself amazing. The Sage had weath
ered many an academic storm on the Farm
without laying anchor in this haven of books
and bookstacks, and the Bellwether brain brack
eted reference books with royalties and author
professors.
But it was the Bellwether posture which
brought the greatest shock. The haphazard fig
ure which usually towered above its more in
significant neighbors was bent in a horseshoe.
Only a magnificent sense of balance kept the
Bellwether nose from digging a sizeable, if
pointed, rut in the concrete steps.
Dignity comes naturally to Bellwether from
any position. "Hello, lad," he said, "been in
that place?"
"Yes, Emery," I answered. "Rather good
place to study."
The Great Man unfolded. From his newly
regained height he slyly questioned, "Suppose
you wonder what I've been doing?"
I admitted the weakness.
A long finger shot downward. "See those?"
Emery said sternly.
A quick glance showed no signs of disaster.
See what, Bellwether?" I countered weakly.
"Cigarette butts," thundered the sage. "Hun
dreds of them! thousands of them! I just
counted 57."
"Yes, Bellwether." I was unconvinced.
"Those are a sign of a deterrently lazy civili
zation," continued the Sage. "We put recep
tacles for the fag remnants and what happens?
They aren't used. There are only 46 butts in
the sand-pots."
"Yes, Emery, perhaps you're right."
"Perhaps, is not the word. What we need is
a great campaign with smoke-writing and a pa
rade built around the theme of 'cigarette butts
in the sand-pots'! Let me think."
I stood mute, watching the Bellwether mind
at work. Suddenly:
I've got it! A Daily campaign. Know any
one over there?"
Indignantly: "Bellwether, I work there. Re
member?"
The Sage brushed this item aside. "Know

the guys who write the editorials? Marvelous,
marvelous; we'll make them write one about it."
Weakly: "Bellwether, sometimes I write
them."
The libe step emancipator stood aghast.
"Well." A pause. "Maybe you could talk one
of the other laddies into doing it." Again he
dripped enthusiasm. "How about it?"
"Perhaps I will, Bellwether. Perhaps I will."

them."
The libe step emancipator stood aghast.
"Well." A pause. "Maybe you could talk one
of the other laddies into doing it." Again he
dripped enthusiasm. "How about it?"
"Perhaps I will, Bellwether. Perhaps I will."
—W. C.
THE Bellwether presence on the libe steps
was in itself amazing. The Sage had weath
ered many an academic storm on the Farm
without laying anchor in this haven of books
and bookstacks, and the Bellwether brain brack
eted reference books with royalties and author
professors.
But it was the Bellwether posture which
brought the greatest shock. The haphazard fig
ure which usually towered above its more in
significant neighbors was bent in a horseshoe.
Only a magnificent sense of balance kept the
Bellwether nose from digging a sizeable, if
pointed, rut in the concrete steps.
Dignity comes naturally to Bellwether from
any position. "Hello, lad," he said, "been in
that place?"
"Yes, Emery," I answered. "Rather good
place to study."
The Great Man unfolded. From his newly
regained height he slyly questioned, "Suppose
you wonder what I've been doing?"
I admitted the weakness.
A long finger shot downward. "See those?"
Emery said sternly.
A quick glance showed no signs of disaster.
See what, Bellwether?" I countered weakly.
"Cigarette butts," thundered the sage. "Hun
dreds of them! thousands of them! I just
counted 57."
"Yes, Bellwether." I was unconvinced.
"Those are a sign of a deterrently lazy civili
zation," continued the Sage. "We put recep
tacles for the fag remnants and what happens?
They aren't used. There are only 46 butts in
the sand-pots."
"Yes, Emery, perhaps you're right."
"Perhaps, is not the word. What we need is
a great campaign with smoke-writing and a pa
rade built around the theme of 'cigarette butts
in the sand-pots'! Let me think."
I stood mute, watching the Bellwether mind
at work. Suddenly:
I've got it! A Daily campaign. Know any
one over there?"
Indignantly: "Bellwether, I work there. Re
member?"
The Sage brushed this item aside. "Know

the guys who write the editorials? Marvelous,
marvelous; we'll make them write one about it."
Weakly: "Bellwether, sometimes I write
them."
The libe step emancipator stood aghast.
"Well." A pause. "Maybe you could talk one
of the other laddies into doing it." Again he
dripped enthusiasm. "How about it?"
"Perhaps I will, Bellwether. Perhaps I will."
