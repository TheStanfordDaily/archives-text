### BUD AMES 
'WHAT YA MEAN? SURE HE'S ANNE TOWNSEND'
{JLARK DANIEL SHAUGHNESSY has come, seen,
and his boys have conquered in four straight tilts.
Albert is lauded from San Diego to Seattle. "The
Chief" Standlee has been mentioned several times as
the best fullback on the Pacific Coast—possibly as All-
American timber. And there is succulent gurgling
about, the Rose Bowl.
Figured in round numbers, that will mean plenty
of folding money that already has and will pour into
the B.A.C. coffers. And it must be admitted that the
B.A.C. well needs this money. It would take you
several long pencils and no end of midnight oil to
estimate the amount of money which every year the
B.A.C. lays on the line so that you, and you, and the
next guy and gal can see or participate in athletic
contests.
It takes a pile of money to run an athletic set-up
such as exists at Stanford.
* # *
that thought stuck right in the front of your
mind, you can easily get the drift of the column.
What follows is not criticism. It is not commemora
tion. It is not suggestion. It is merely a question—a
long question running down to where Campus Opinion
takes over.
Perhaps you can supply the answer.
The subject under discussion is the proposed check
up by B.A.C. officials of student body cards at the
U.C.L.A.-Stanford game, scheduled for a couple of
Saturdays from now. At the same game two years
ago, their was such a check-up, with the result that
about 500 "non-members" were found holding Farm
student body cards in their hot hands and trying to
look innocent under slightly dirty rooters' caps.
How about it? Do you think there should be such
a check-up? Do you think some change should be made
to your student body card—such as attaching your pic
ture—which would absolutely prevent transfer? Or
do you think that everybody holding a student body
card at the U.C.L.A. gate—at any gate, for that mat
ter —should be admitted without question? Well?
# * # *
O n the one hand, speaking fcr the 8.A.C., you've
got to admit that they are within their rights to
yell about the number of persons who arc pulling off
a subtle crawl under the backside of the circus tent.
The B.A.C. is dishing out money to make this game
possible, to print tickets, to send the team South—to
do a hundred things.
Their return for such expenditures comes from their
percentage of the gate receipts. And these receipts help
in further continuing the life of the B.A.C. It is a nec
essary and vicious cycle.
On the other other hand, speaking for the students,
you've got to admit that in paying for their student
body card they are paying for a seat at every foot
ball game. Why shouldn't they be permitted to do
what they wish with it? And also, the student body
cards are never transferred to some tramp who just
walked into town. The "right sort" of people get their
temporary use.
And a half empty rooting section down at Los An
geles wouldn't look very impressive. Just think back
to the "best-ever" rooting section you had at the S.C.
game in Los Angeles last fall. Not all of that rooting
section came from Stanford—not by a long shot.
So take your pick.

Just an added note: to the Bookstore. Our apolo
gies for our comment of a couple of days ago re
garding the new rebate system. The thought was
student thought. The way it was worded was un
necessarily nasty.

On the other other hand, speaking for the students,
you've got to admit that in paying for their student
body card they are paying for a seat at every foot
ball game. Why shouldn't they be permitted to do
what they wish with it? And also, the student body
cards are never transferred to some tramp who just
walked into town. The "right sort" of people get their
temporary use.
And a half empty rooting section down at Los An
geles wouldn't look very impressive. Just think back
to the "best-ever" rooting section you had at the S.C.
game in Los Angeles last fall. Not all of that rooting
section came from Stanford—not by a long shot.
So take your pick.

Figured in round numbers, that will mean plenty
of folding money that already has and will pour into

long question running down to where Campus Opinion

The subject under discussion is the proposed check
up by B.A.C. officials of student body cards at the
U.C.L.A.-Stanford game, scheduled for a couple of
Saturdays from now. At the same game two years
ago, their was such a check-up, with the result that
about 500 "non-members" were found holding Farm
student body cards in their hot hands and trying to
look innocent under slightly dirty rooters' caps.
How about it? Do you think there should be such
a check-up? Do you think some change should be made
to your student body card—such as attaching your pic
ture—which would absolutely prevent transfer? Or
do you think that everybody holding a student body
card at the U.C.L.A. gate—at any gate, for that mat
ter —should be admitted without question? Well?

O n the one hand, speaking fcr the 8.A.C., you've

possible, to print tickets, to send the team South—to
do a hundred things.
Their return for such expenditures comes from their
percentage of the gate receipts. And these receipts help
in further continuing the life of the B.A.C. It is a nec
