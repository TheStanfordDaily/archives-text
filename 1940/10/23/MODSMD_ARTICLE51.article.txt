EDITOR, SIR:
Tolerance, you have declared in the editorial
column of October 21, is a supreme virtue, a virtue
that becomes ambiguous only in its ludicrous applica
tion to the United States Constitution. For by this
very freedom of speech and press, rights that the
Constitution guarantees sacredly and indiscriminately
in the first and fourteenth amendments, is it possible
for individuals not only to criticize, condemn, and
disparage the United States government, but also to
plead persuasively for thier particular ideology.
The Constitution remains "The Supreme Law of
the Land," liable to the interpretation of men, and
subject to future amplification by man-made decrees.
The Supreme Court is not a vegetative tribunal dedi
cated merely to the safeguarding of existing laws, but
it is the vital accomplice of Congress in creating cir
cuitously (under the "implied powers" of the national
government) such legislation as will preserve the
dignity and the integrity of the United States govern
ment from jeopardy by vehement maliciousness.
Following the Federal Espionage Act of 1917, ap
peared the "clear and present danger" interpretation
stated in 1919 by Mr. Justice Holmes, and its co
interpreter the "bad tendency" test of 1925.
Even in peace time by these rules treacherous activ
ities directly "ADVOCATING" the overthrow of the
government, or perniciously "TENDING" to endanger
public welfare can be lawfully terminated and pun
ished. Along with the police-power codes of the states,
these two doctrines have verily, and "viriley" seduced
that paradoxical constitutional virtueâ€”Tolerance.
