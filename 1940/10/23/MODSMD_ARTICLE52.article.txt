# STOMACH, FOOD, AND AN ARMY
## 
### 
r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
We of Encina object! Yes, I mean object! Ob
ject. about what, you ask? Well, we will tell you. We
pay $1.20 a day for meals and we are served with
poor food made conspicuous by its absence. Hardly
anybody eats breakfast on Saturday morning and
when they go to eat lunch they find a lousy salad and
a couple of sandwiches. The day after Roble has
fried chicken we have chicken hash. Once they
slapped the hash on toast and classed it as chicken-a
la-king. I suppose this isn't the first beef about the
meals, nor the last, but we feel it is high time some
thing is done about the food situation.
As I have said, we pay $1.20 a day whether we eat
or not. We could cat at the Union for SI.IO a day and
enjoy a better meal when we want it. Why can the
Union Cellar serve a varied menu cheaper than the
Encina dining hall can serve when they serve us
what they want when they want to. Yes, wo of En
cina are wondering what kind of a deal is coming off
whenever we are served with our skimpy meals. Why
can't we have better meals; we pay for them. They
say an army travels on its stomach: well, how can we
study on an empty stomach-?
