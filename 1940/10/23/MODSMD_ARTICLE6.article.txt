# Yehudi Menuhin Opens 1940 Series in Auditorium Tonight
## 
### 
.. Yelnidi Menuhin will present a program of universal appeal when he |
officially opens the 1940 Stanford Concert Series in Memorial Auditorium '
tonight at 8:15 o'clock. The concert has been planned with an eye to the
tastes of both the discriminating music-lover and the average student.
To open the program, Mr. Menuhin has chosen the "Sonata in G Minor" |

known as the "Devil's Trill,"
Tartini, with additional passages by
Kreisler. This sonata is the most
outstanding of all Tartini's works,
and one of the few which is still
found in the modern violinist's
repertoire.
AMAZING FACILITY
It is especially difficult in that it
contains many trills and cadenzas
which are the despair of less pro
ficient musicians. An important part
of Menuhin's genius is his ability to
perform such technical feats with an
amazing facility.
Second on the program for to
night is Paganini's "Concerto Num
ber One in D Major, Opus 6."' This
is another example of the dazzling
brilliance and intricate finger work
which characterize Paganini's com
positions.
LIGHTER WORKS
Following the intermission Mr.
Menuhin will return to perform the
massive Bach "Sonata in C Major"
for violin. To round out the pro
gram and add a somewhat lighter
touch to the evening, the final group j
will include five popular, well known
selections.
The first of these will be Dvorak's
Negro Spiritual Melody taken from
his beautiful "New World Sym
phony." The theme from the Largo
of that work has been arranged es
pecially for the violin by Fritz
Kreisler. Second in the group will
be Sarasate's "Caprice Basque."
TICKETS ON HAND
The well-loved "Caprice Vienois"
by Kreisler, Debussy's "La Fille aux
Cheveux de Lin" and Bazzini's "La
Ronde des Lutons," the dance of
the goblins, will complete this ex
ceptional program.
A few single and season tickets
are still available at the office of Ihe 1
Concert Series in the Old Union, ac
cording to Elinor Hall, concert man- |
ager. Students who have already j
purchased tickets of either kind
should pick them up there before
tonight's performance.
