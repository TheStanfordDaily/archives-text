### 
I
John B. Rael, who has been in- j
vestigating Spanish folklore in Colo- !
rado and New Mexico, will speak
tomorrow on the Stanford Radio \
Hour over KPO at 5:30 o'clock. Hav
ing spent the last ten years among
the people of this region collecting
folk stories, riddles, and interesting
characters, Mr. Rael has many
quaint anecdotes to relate.
Set in a background of long win
ter evenings and firesides, the stories
range all the way from the creation
of the world to drunkards, wife
stealers, and witches.
While most of the old-time story
tellers have disappeared with the
new forms of amusements, Mr. Rael
has managed to collect some 507 folk
stories along which have been
handed down from generation to
generation by word of mouth.
