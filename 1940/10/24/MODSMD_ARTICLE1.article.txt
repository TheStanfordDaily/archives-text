I DIPLOMATIC maneuvers in Eu
rope during the past 48 hours
may result in agreements that will
affect the course of history of the
peoples of the entire world.
Hitler Tuesday conferred with
Marshall Petain, v 84-year-old head
man in the provisional French gov
ernment at Vichy, "somewhere in
France" and last night met Gen
eralissimo Franco, Spanish civil war |
general, who is virtual dictator of
his country.
It is too early to predict what
will be the outcome of these meet
ings, hut if newspapers in the
capitals of Europe are any indica
tion of the importance of the con
versations, they must be truly mo
mentous. Military experts in the
United States are agreed that Hit- j
lor has decided to try some new
plan that will coincide with his
blockade of the British Isles.
* + *
WPAIN has not participated active-
K ly on the side of the Axis in the
present war, but it is felt that
Franco would need little encourage
ment to become a belligerent when
things are looking darkest for Great
Britain. Nationalist Spaniai'ds will
be asked to remember the aid that
both Hitler and Mussolini supplied
them in their long civil war.
Spain at present is importing nu
merous articles through the British
blockade, but should she become a
belligerent these importations un
doubtedly would be halted. But
Spain would quite possibly not be
asked to provide any military help
should she join the Axis. Hitler and
Mussolini would like to operate
from Spanish soil in order to facili
tate an attack on Gibraltar.
Regardless of other far-reaching
deals which may develop — such as
the possible secession of several
pieces of French territory to the
Germans in return for a favorable
peace at home—it is becoming clear
that the aim of the Axis powers is
ultimately to control the Mediterra
nean and the areas that border upon
it.
To accomplish this, the Axis will
attempt to make Gibraltar unten
able or make passage of British
warships there impossible. The
pincer movement around the Suez
Canal has already been suggested
by Hitler's pressure on Turkey
and Italy's military action in
Egypt.
Upon the success of the present
talks may depend the fate of Brit
ain's Mediterranean fleet, her rich
oil sources in the Near East, and her
most important Empire lifeline.

r | PENSION in the Balkans was re
ported to have relaxed as Hitler
drew the world's attention to West
ern Europe but as one commenta
tor put it, this appeared to be more
of the nature of "whistling in the
dark."
The same observation might be
made aptly in regard to the situa
tion in the Far East. The Japanese
arc desirous of coming to some
amicable agreement with Russia, it
appears, with the firm stand of Brit
ain and the United States making
Japan's position more precarious.
Russia's decision in the Far East
is watched as intently as her deci
sion in the Balkans and the Near
East.
Diplomatic negotiations arc go
ing on in Moscow and Tokyo, on
which the Japanese arc basing
their hopes. In Istanbul, British
ministers in the Balkan region are
conferring with Anthony Eden,
British war secretary. The Axis
hopes that this British effort to
form a bloc to stop the Nazi thrust
will collapse.
Although it is impossible to make
any definite predictions at this time
as to the outcome of these various
diplomatic maneuvers, it is clear
that the Axis will attempt to dis
play a more powerful front to the
British before the ele.ction in the
United States.
One influential newspaper in
Madrid yesterday said that major
events "will be precipitated before
the United States election." Whether
these events will make it appear that
the President is dragging this coun
try into war is yet to be seen.

Regardless of other far-reaching
deals which may develop — such as
the possible secession of several
pieces of French territory to the
Germans in return for a favorable
peace at home—it is becoming clear
that the aim of the Axis powers is
ultimately to control the Mediterra
nean and the areas that border upon
it.
To accomplish this, the Axis will
attempt to make Gibraltar unten
able or make passage of British
warships there impossible. The
pincer movement around the Suez
Canal has already been suggested
by Hitler's pressure on Turkey
and Italy's military action in
Egypt.
Upon the success of the present
