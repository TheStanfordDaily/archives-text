# Menuhin's Flawless Technique Thrills Big Concert Audience
## 
### AMIE REICHERT 
Memorial Auditorium, packed al- j
most to overflowing last night, await
ed breathlessly the incomparable
magic of Yehudi Menuhin's violin. |
The audience was not disappointed. !
With a versatility that it charac- !
teristic of his matchless genius, !
Menuhin gave the Stanford audience j
something of the flawless technique |
and interpretation that has won him
acclaim all over the world.
The program was a difficult one.
Almost all the compositions chosen
were glutted with intricate progres
sions of thirds and fourths, disso
nant and harmonic chords, and tech
nical runs and trills. But passages
that would have been the despair of
less proficient musicians were per
formed with an amazingly facile
skill by Menuhin.
PAGANINI OUTSTANDING
Especially outstanding in this re
spect was the Paganini Concerto
No. 1 in D Major, Opus 6. This
work, which is in itself a flashing
masterpiece of melody and complex
harmony, took on an added bril
liance and perfection last night. The
Emile Sauret cadenza, a maze of
violin prototechnics, was performed
immaculately, the tones as clear and
sharp in the most intricate passages
as in the simplest.
Tartini's Sonata in G Minor, which
opened the program, was played with
feeling and restraint and an excep
tionally fine tone. Again the tech
nical acrobatics were rendered with
grace and skill.
Returning after the intermission,
Mr. Menuhin resumed the program
with the massive, majestic Bach So
nata in C Major. The adagio, deep
toned and reminiscent of church
music, lead steadfastly into the tri
umphant fugue in C major. Played
with a mathematical precision,
where the composition required it,
and a sparkling, rhythmic brilliance,
this work was definitely one of the
highlights of the concert. Menuhin's
unfaltering technique once more
drew tremendous applause from the
enthralled audience.
VARIES THEME
This sonata was especially inter-
I esting in that it was basically one

simple theme, which the composer
varied throughout, the entire com
position, weaving it in and out with
melodic chord progressions and
lightning runs.
The final group on the program
began with Kreisler's beautiful ar
rangement for violin of the Largo
from Dvorak's "New World Sym
phony." It was played with infinite
feeling and a richness and depth of
expression.
Following this Mr. Menuhin
played the sprightly "Caprice
Basque" by Sarasateâ€”a deftly han
dled work combining warmth of
melody and sparkling technique.
The hauntingly beautiful, tinkling,
laughing, truly capricious "Caprice
Venois" by Kreisler, as always, was
one of the more popular numbers on
ihe program.
DEBUSSY CLOSES
Closing the group were Debussy's
"La Fille aux cheveux de lin," an
elusive, wistful bit of music which
was performed with delicacy and
restraint, and Bazzini's flashy "La
Ronde des lutins."
In response to the enthusiastic ap
plause and insistence of the audi
ence, Mr. Menuhin returned to play
four encores. Shubert's immortal
Ave Maria completed this group,
ending the concert.
As a whole, the evening was one
of rare harmonic brililance and su
perb technical expression. Seldom
in the history of the Concert Scries
has Stanford been privileged to hear
so flawless an artist and so excep
tional a program.
