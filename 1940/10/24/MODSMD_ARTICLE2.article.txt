# B.A.C. Allocates $1,350 To Send Stanford Band South for U.C.L.A. Game
## Previous Board Decision Revised; Rooters Tickets to Be Checked; 'Students Need Not Worry,' Masters 
### 
Stanford Board of Athletic Control last night appropriated $1,350 to
send the Stanford band south next week-end to the U.C.L.A. game.
This action overrules a previous decision by the board not to send
the band south due to financial difficulties.
Student tickets for the rooters' section at the U.C.L.A. game will be

checked at the gates, A1 Masters,,
graduate manager, announced.
This announcement answers a
question which has been on the lips
of students for over a week, fol
lowing rumor some time ago that
the tickets would be checked.
NEED NOT WORRY'
However, Masters stated, "Those
rooters who use their own tickets
need not worry." No outline of what
checking method would be employed
was given.
The band accompanied the team
south last year to the U.S.C. game,
and last night's announcement con
firms popular hopes that the or
ganization would again be able to
make the trip.
Masters stated earlier this week
there were over 500 violations of the
use of the cards two years ago.
No more rooters' tickets are
available for the U.C.L.A. game. It
was pointed out that it was unlikely
that any tickets would be returned,
as no refund would be made on
them.
