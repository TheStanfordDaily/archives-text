# U.S. Moves To Bulwark Philippines
## Two Air Squadrons To Supplement Army hi Far East Crisis 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 23 (UP).â€”
The United States government, in ,
another move to bulwark its Pacific
out posts, revealed tonight two first- I
line army pursuit squadrons were
being transferred to the Philippine
Islands.
The two squadrons would bol
ster the Philippine garrison, which
now houses 24,000 army men in
cluding infantry, field artillery, j
cavalry and coast artillery units, as i
well as air groups including the
Fourth Composite Army Air Corps,
the Third Pursuit, the Second Ob
servation Squadron, the Twentieth
Airbase and the Twenty - eighth
Bombardment.
MOKE PLANES
Also to be added to this group, j
Secretary of State Cordell Hull said ;
loday, will be ten military planes j
which this government repossessed
.m Manila en route from the United i
States to Thailand (Siam). The de
livery of the American-built planes
to Thailand was blocked recently
when that little Pacific state was
making fresh territorial demands
upon French Indo-China.
There was a feeling among some j
government experts that Japan was
behind Thailand's pressure for new
land. Fear the ten planes might be |
used to support the Japanese, di
rectly or indirectly, largely was re
sponsible for halting their delivery.
MOKE PRECAUTIONS
The order strengthening the Phil- i
ippine garrison was regarded as an- j
other step in a precautionary pro
gram expedited by Japan's entry
into a military pact with Rome and
Berlin. Diplomatic experts feel if
the expansion of the alliance was
designed by Germany and Italy io j
divert America's attention from the j
European war to the Far East, and j
by Japan to avert an Anglo-Ameri
can stand in the Pacific, its purpose
has not been achieved.
There has been no change in the
administration's policy to continue
and steadily expand "short-of-war"
aid to embattled Britain, and there
nave been no indications such a
change may be expected to come
from the Rome-Berlin-Tokyo ma
neuver. The United States has
sought to slow up the Japanese war
machine by embargoing exports of
scrap iron and steel, and has made
other moves distasteful to Japan.
