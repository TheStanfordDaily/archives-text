NEW YORK, Oct. 23 (UP).â€”Wen
dell L. Willkie, charging the New
Deal was leading the nation toward
"state domination over our lives,"
asserted tonight "the concentration
of power in America has hurt every
democrat and helped every rising
dictator."
"Democracy," the Republican
presidential candidate said, "cannot
survive under conditions of pro
longed depression. Depressions are
the very soil in which dictatorships
take root and grow to power . . ."
Willkie said the New Deal had
taken power at every opportunity,
"and yet with all this power the
New Deal has utterly failed to solve
our economic problems."
