# Kaiser, Nazi Regimes Both Exile Noted World War Cartoonist
## 
### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
It was in a little Dutch town on the German border in 1917. Talking to
two strangers, a Dutch sentry confided, "The German on the other side of
the fence told me this morning that there is one man in Holland who. if
induced across the line by Dutch soldiers, would be worth 12.0110 marks

upon delivery." 4
The gossiping soldier did not !
know it, but he was addressing the
very man whom the Kaiser had of- !
fered the reward for—Louis Rae- |
maekers, the cartoonist.
Nor was it the last time that Rae
maekers felt the wrath of a German
government. With the invasion of
the Low Countries by the Nazis six
months ago. Hitler's Gestapo was out
to get Raemaekers. But he escaped
from Brussels to England and in
June landed in New York to work
for the Herald Tribune.
HOOVER GETS CARTOONS
Last winter, fearing the coming
holocaust, Raemaekers sent his col
lection of 4,00 ft priceless cartoon
originals to the Hoover Library for
safekeeping. These are the cartoons
that have made him the most pow
erful individual propagandist against
Germany, perhaps today as well as
in World War I.
Receipt of the collection was kept
in secrecy. But upon the artist's
arrival in the United States restric
tions were lifted. The collection is
now being exhibited in the New
"York Holland House gallery. Rae
maekers has presented 100 of the
famous cartoons to the Hoover
Library.
GERMANY HORRIFIES
The half-German Dutchman, now
bespectacled and grey a? 71, is a
gentle, mild-mannered man. But, ov
coming his even-temper was his
distress and horror of the German
invasion of the Low Lands in 1914
and 1940. And now as in the past
he expresses his fury in charcoal
drawings that have stirred much of
the world against the Germans.
His cartoons in the past were
heavy, depressing drawings of
blood, ravished women, dead sml
diers, and terrible Huns. Now his
charcoal stick sketches with a
wierd. supernatural touch depicting
the forces of the world—a skeleton
Hitler, Stalin as a satan, the figure
of Christ searching for peace.
A.s in the last war when* he came
to the United Slates, Raemaekers is
again helping to mold America's
public opinion.
