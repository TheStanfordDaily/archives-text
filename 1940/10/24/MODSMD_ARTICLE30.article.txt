# Eddy Advises Aid for Britain
## 'America Threatened By Naziism Menace' 
### 
All possible aid short of war to j
Britain was advocated by Sherwood j
Eddy, widely known leader of the
world Student Christian Movement
and one-time president of the In- i
ternational Y.M.C.A., when he j
spoke on the topic, "America and
ihe World Crisis" yesterday at 12:30
o'clock to a crowd of Luncheon
Club guests that filled every avail
able space in the Nitery.
"America is threatened by the 1
Nazi menace," fMr. Eddy said after
quoting from "Mein Kampf." "What
| would we do if we woke up some
morning to learn that Hitler's fifth
columnists had taken over Brazil
and Hitler was getting closer and
j closer to Mexico? Would we wait for
j him to get to our very borders?"
"We are not called upon to attack
Hitler on the continent of Europe,"
the speaker said. "But we are
I called upon to rearm our country."
There are three systems that offer so
lutions to world problems, Mr. Eddy
j stated.
"Naziism is one, with a superman
ito determine right and wrong for
â€¢everyone, and a super-religion to
teach obedience to the superman.
This is a blind alley, a false hope.
Another solution is the high ideals of
i the Russian revolution, which in 23
; years have not had a chance to ful
; fill themselves because of Stalin's
; mistakes and deceit," the speaker
j continued.
"There is left democracy with the
kingdom of God in the moral field
| as a common denominator between
Catholicism, Protestantism, and Ju
daism, and the 'American Dream' in
the secular field." A clash of ideals
is an issue of the war, and for that
| reason we should send all possible
aid to Britain, although we should
not enter the war unless the axis
! powers commit an overt act of war
against the United States, he ex
j plained.
Mr. Eddy predicted that if Hitler
could not take England now ht
would leave it partly in ashes, sub
due Egypt and cut the Empire in
i half in the Mediterranean.
Thirty-eight Stanford men were
sent to the Philippines in the Span
-1 ish-American War.
