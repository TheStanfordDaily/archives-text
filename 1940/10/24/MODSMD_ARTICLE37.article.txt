AREA sports writers, after
holding ofi: and saying, "Well,
if they win this week we'll be con
vinced they're good," have finally
gone overboard on Clark Shaughnes
sy's gang of redskin raiders. So far
overboard, in fact, that they're swim
ming with their hats on.
Some experts, after the Indians
trounced Washington State, have
handed the Rose Bowl nomination
to the Stanford team in spite of the
fact that the Shaughnessymen must
meet and conquer the four toughest
teams in the conference on suc
cessive week-ends.
Southern California will unleash
1 fie most powerful, bruising offense
on the Coast Saturday in the Sta
dium. The following week-end
Stanford will face the ever-present
threat of Jackie Robinson, some
thing Cal didn't have to cope with
over at Berkeley.
Next comes Washington, a truly
great team that was unlucky to drop
a close decision to a vastly under
rated Minnesota eleven. After that
the best team Oregon State has
fielded in years, then a week's rest
and the Big Game.
With ' the breaks this inspired
Stanford squad can get over all these
foes, but let's not start yelling too
much about Pasadena until we ac-

tually get there.
Even if Lady Luck* Dame Fortune,
or whatever your name for the old
girl is, should move over to the
other side right now, the Indians
have enjoyed a much more success
ful season than most people antici
pated.

' Injury to Rod Warnccke in scrim
mage Tuesday night may prove far
mere serious than it looks at first
glance.
If the shoulder injury proves
really serious, bad enough to keep
Warneke out of the game Saturday,
the team will miss him greatly. He's
the steady, consistent type of ball
player who never appears flashy but
is always in there holding down his
spot. I
Behind Warnecke is Ed Stamm, big,
solidly built sophomore. Stamm is a
promising lineman, but was never in
at tackle until this fall. Ho has
played some in games, but not
enough to really feel at home in the
position against the Trojan power
plays, many of which will be run
right over his position.
However, if Stamm comes
through in a strange position as
well as Chuck Taylor did, Stan
ford followers won't have much to
fear in Warnecke's absence.

gone overboard on Clark Shaughnes
sy's gang of redskin raiders. So far
overboard, in fact, that they're swim
ming with their hats on.
Some experts, after the Indians
trounced Washington State, have
handed the Rose Bowl nomination
to the Stanford team in spite of the
fact that the Shaughnessymen must
meet and conquer the four toughest
teams in the conference on suc
cessive week-ends.
Southern California will unleash
1 fie most powerful, bruising offense
on the Coast Saturday in the Sta
dium. The following week-end
Stanford will face the ever-present
threat of Jackie Robinson, some
thing Cal didn't have to cope with
over at Berkeley.
Next comes Washington, a truly
great team that was unlucky to drop
a close decision to a vastly under
rated Minnesota eleven. After that
the best team Oregon State has
fielded in years, then a week's rest
and the Big Game.
With ' the breaks this inspired
Stanford squad can get over all these
foes, but let's not start yelling too
much about Pasadena until we ac-

tually get there.
Even if Lady Luck* Dame Fortune,
or whatever your name for the old
girl is, should move over to the
other side right now, the Indians
have enjoyed a much more success
ful season than most people antici
pated.

' Injury to Rod Warnccke in scrim
mage Tuesday night may prove far
mere serious than it looks at first
glance.
If the shoulder injury proves
really serious, bad enough to keep
Warneke out of the game Saturday,
the team will miss him greatly. He's
the steady, consistent type of ball
player who never appears flashy but
is always in there holding down his
spot. I
Behind Warnecke is Ed Stamm, big,
solidly built sophomore. Stamm is a
promising lineman, but was never in
at tackle until this fall. Ho has
played some in games, but not
enough to really feel at home in the
position against the Trojan power
plays, many of which will be run
right over his position.
However, if Stamm comes
through in a strange position as
well as Chuck Taylor did, Stan
ford followers won't have much to
fear in Warnecke's absence.
