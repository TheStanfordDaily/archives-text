### 
SEATTLE, Oct. 23 (UP). — Re
serves bore the brunt of workouts
in the University of Washington
football camp today as a driving
rain effectively hampered aerial
practice, both on defense and of
fense. Coach Jimmy Phelan said he
was prepared for another Saturday
of rain when the California Bears
come to town.
Only three countries surpass the
United States in population—China,
India, and Russia.
