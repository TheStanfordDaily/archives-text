## JERRY BRUCKER, Sports Editor Warnecke Lost To Grid Team For S.C. Clash 
### 
Stanford's chances to keep clear
their path (<> the Rose Rnul and to
yet ri'.venge on U.S.C.'s Terrible
Trojans this Saturday for that un
â– nc rcii'ul 23-0 drubbing last year
took a had drop yesterday when the
varsity physicians, Dr. Fritz Roth
and Dr. Paul Davics, announced that
first-string tackle Rod Warneeke
wculd be unable to play against the
Trojans.
Warneeke, who hurt himself Tues- 1
; day after 4 or 5 minutes of scrim- 1
I mage, has an injured muscle in his 1
; shoulder and was not able to even !
I attend yesterday's practice session, j
He is si ill having heat treatments !
but will be in shape, according to ;
the team doctors, for the following
; week-end's U.C.L.A. game.
Warnecke's injury leaves a couple
! of young, husky sophomore linemen
| to hold down the left tackle spot, i
j They are 220-pound Ed Stamm and i
chunky 'Ed McCain at around 200 j
pounds. Right, now Stamm appears !
to be in line for Saturday's starting I
post, what with McCain's early, sea- i
son injury to hold him back and j
with Stamm's imposing total of I
playing minutes for experience.
MeC A IN IMPROVING
But McCain, who was a guard on
the frosh team last year and who j
; was recently shifted to tackle, has j
i come with a rush in the last few
days of practice and the low-to-the
ground, faster charging sophomore
may get the call over his fellow
classmate.
Under the volunteered instruction
j of Louie Vincenti, a crackerjack end
! for Stanford in 1927 whose pass re
l ceiving made him a hero against
; fJ.S.C. in that year, the Card varsity
: has been learning things about the
| Trojans.
VINCENTI ASSISTS
Vincenti, who lives in Pasadena,
has seen the Thundering Herd in
every one of their games this year
except the Illinois contest; and be
ing an experienced footballer, he
h?s been able to pick out the strong
points and weak spots of Howard
Jones' team and pass this informa
tion on to Coach Clark Shaughnessy.
After the Warneeke accident, the
varsity has steered clear of any sort
| of contact work and are concentrat
ing on timing and deception in their
| own offense. Practice lasted late
I again last night, and after training
1 table the team saw for the second
time the none-too-heartening pic
tures of the Washington State game.
TROJANS HURT. TOO
h News from the South shows that
j U.S.C. also has its injury troubles.
Two of the Trojans' potential first-
I stringers when the season started
have been hurt so far this year, and
this fact has been used several times
to explain Troy's none-too-imposing
record.
They are Floyd Phillips and
i Mickey Anderson. Thr- first is an
other of those over-200-pound Tro
jan linemen but Floyd had his leg
broken and has not seen any action
tor several weeks.
| Stanford fans will remember the
| dash and dodge of "Trickey Mickey"
! Anderson during the past two
i U.S.C.-Stanford games. Far-sighted
| experts saw in this year's Troy
; Indian game a renewal of the cinder
j path feud between sprinters Clyde
i Jeffrey and this Anderson on the
! gridiron, but now neither are in
i condition to play.
