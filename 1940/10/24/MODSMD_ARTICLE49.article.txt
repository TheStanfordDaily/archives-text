COGNIZANT of the fact that Stanford Uni
versity is entering its fiftieth year of exist
ence, The Daily, commencing next Monday, will
sponsor a Know Stanford contest as its part
of the semi-centennial activities the campus will
witness and engage in this year.
The contest will be held over a five-week
period, with two sets of guestions appearing in
the columns of The Daily each week—on Mon
days and Wednesdays. Each week's winners
v/ill be disgualified for future competition. How
ever, at the end of the five-week period, the five
winners will compete at an all-University as
sembly for the 575 first prize and 525 second
award.
Two Daily members, Editor Dwight Hutchin
son and Feature Editor Jean Nowell, who are
judges for the contest along with Dr. George
Culver, retired Dean of Men, and Bruce Jessup
and Anne Townsend, president and vice-presi
dent of the A.S.S.U., were absolutely astounded
by the wealth of amazing material concerning
the University's history that they ran into while
doing research for possible contest guestions.
To win the contest will reguire a certain
amount of effort, as it is extremely doubtful
whether any entrant will be able to answer even
a small percentage of the guestions from his
current fund of knowledge. But this difficulty
will be overcome by a list of sources that will
be published in The Daily with each set of
gueries.
The denouement of the contest will be a de
velopment that the contest judges believe to
be absolutely revolutionary —as far as Stanford
is concerned.
The five winners of the weekly contests will
be herded into Memorial Theater and before
the eyes of the student body will go through a
regular "Information Please" session to deter
mine the final winners.
So here's your chance to get the "inside" on
Stanford's history, so that many years hence
you'll be able to teeter your little grandchildren
on your knee and astonish them with your
knowledge of the Alma Mater.
And in case you don't manage to finagle any
grandchildren, the 575 and 525 prizes may offer
sufficient compensation.—G. M.

The five winners of the weekly contests will
be herded into Memorial Theater and before
the eyes of the student body will go through a
regular "Information Please" session to deter
mine the final winners.
So here's your chance to get the "inside" on
Stanford's history, so that many years hence
you'll be able to teeter your little grandchildren
on your knee and astonish them with your
knowledge of the Alma Mater.
And in case you don't manage to finagle any
grandchildren, the 575 and 525 prizes may offer
sufficient compensation.—G. M.
COGNIZANT of the fact that Stanford Uni
versity is entering its fiftieth year of exist
ence, The Daily, commencing next Monday, will
sponsor a Know Stanford contest as its part
of the semi-centennial activities the campus will
witness and engage in this year.
The contest will be held over a five-week
period, with two sets of guestions appearing in
the columns of The Daily each week—on Mon
days and Wednesdays. Each week's winners
v/ill be disgualified for future competition. How
ever, at the end of the five-week period, the five
winners will compete at an all-University as
sembly for the 575 first prize and 525 second
award.
Two Daily members, Editor Dwight Hutchin
son and Feature Editor Jean Nowell, who are
judges for the contest along with Dr. George
Culver, retired Dean of Men, and Bruce Jessup
and Anne Townsend, president and vice-presi
dent of the A.S.S.U., were absolutely astounded
by the wealth of amazing material concerning
the University's history that they ran into while
doing research for possible contest guestions.
To win the contest will reguire a certain
amount of effort, as it is extremely doubtful
whether any entrant will be able to answer even
a small percentage of the guestions from his
current fund of knowledge. But this difficulty
will be overcome by a list of sources that will
be published in The Daily with each set of
gueries.
The denouement of the contest will be a de
velopment that the contest judges believe to
be absolutely revolutionary —as far as Stanford
is concerned.
