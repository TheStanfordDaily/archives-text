# Bombers Strike Heart of London

LONDON, Oct. 23 (UP).â€”German
raiders glided silently down on Lon
don from a great height tonight
eluding the capital's newly strength
ened outer defenses, and bombed a
few districts in the metropolitan
area.
They were coming through the
black night, and nasty flying weather
in fewer numbers than usual, how
ever, and as midnight drew near the
city was enjoying its fourth rela
tively quiet night in succession.
