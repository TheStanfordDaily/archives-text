# The
						Number of Destiny

ANY student over the age of 21 who desires
to know what his registration number for
the coming draft will be may find out now by
merely dropping by the local selection board's
offices at 514 Bryant Street, Palo Alto.
Of course, a number of students who realize
that it is not necessary to know their draft num
ber because when it is picked they will auto
matically be informed by the government, may
not even inquire. But a majority of the Stan
fordites who signed last October 16 will be
interested in the little set of numerals which is
so intimately tied up with their entire futures.
When one little sequence of numbers, which
in this district will be no higher than 4,355, can
be the master control of a man's future life, the
index which may cnange his plans of marriage
and career, it is almost impossible not to exert
some curiosity as to its appearance.
Amazing has been the seeming acceptance
by the nation as a whole of the Selective Service
Act. Even a great percentage of the prime dis
senters have apparently resigned themselves to
the will of the majority. Of course, there are
numerous exceptions, an example of which
came to the attention of The Daily yesterday.
A Campus Opinion contribution, written by
a student, was dropped under the Editor's door.
The writer complained bitterly of the ultra
patriotic wave of hysteria that is enveloping the
country. Claiming that he alone stood solitarily
and futilely in defiance of public opinion, the
writer advanced the information that he had
refused to register!
Although it means a clear breach of law and
places me in a most dangerous position, I con
sidor my principles in this act of protest to be

of far greater moment than my personal safety
or freedom," said the writer.
He thereupon displayed his noble disregard
for "personal safety" by signing another per
son's name to the letter. —G. M.
