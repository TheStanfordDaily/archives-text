FRIEND IN NEED—FRIEND INDEED
AS the old, old saying goes: "A friend in need is a
friend indeed." So let's take a couple of minutes
off and give a few deep-felt thanks to a true Stanford
friend.
His name—Bill Leiser. His occupation—writing a
sports column for the San Francisco Chronicle.
If you can hark back to around September 27 of
this fall, you will perhaps remember that, in the
eyes of sports writers, Stanford had little of encour
agement to which they might look forward in the
coming gridiron battles. There were "a few of last
year's not-so-good" players back on the Farm, and—
oh, yes—a bunch of "pretty green sophomores."
Nope; the sports writers figured Stanford wasn't
much to worry about.
A hunk of Dick Firendlich's column before the
U.S.F. game ran, "Incidentally, the statisticians are
pointing out that Stanford hasn't won the opening
game of its season since the Vow Boys beat San Jose
State in 1935."
Such was the general trend of predictions by the
majority—the vast majority—of typewriter hounds.
Stanford had a "fair" team but they would probably
take a trimming anyway.
Not so with Bill Leiser, who went out on the pre
diction limb when he wrote, "Stanford, it is our hunch,
will defeat U.S.F., though all know advantages lie
with the Dons. . . . It's just our hunch that the Clark
Shaughnessy type of football will have a lucky day and
get away."
* * # j|«
W/ITH our juicy victory over U.S.F., most of the
writers attempted to jump on the week-old band
wagon, and quotes about how they "had known what
was going to happen all the time" came thick and
fast. But when it came to next week's game with
Oregon—well ..."
Sportswriter Art Rosenbaum wrote, "Not that
we begrudge Stanford its sweet hour of light and
sunshine, but the lack of a few touchdowns might be
an equal signal for disappearance of all the back
slapping that now goes on."
Again Bill Leiser went out on the limb and picked
Stanford to win. We did. Remember?
# »l« *
PY the time we had come to face Santa Clara the
story had become monotonous. Before the game
Floyd Russell quoted the odds 10-7 in favor of Santa
Clara. Grantland Rice picked Santa Clara over Stan
ford. In fact, he even picked Washington State over
us last week.
Not so Bill Leiser. From his typewriter came, "Let's
say Stanford over Santa Clara. Everyone else is pick
ing Santa Clara, so what good would it do us to join
in with the rest of the crew, even if we turned out
to be right." Which is just Leiser's subtle way of say
ing that he thinks that the Cards had and have the
best team. He has done it before every game we have
played.
So to Bill Leiser we all owe some sort of thank
you's. It takes a lot of journalistic grit to pick an
entirely new and inexperienced team when all the
other writers are placing that team in the haven't-got
a-chance column.

And speaking of getting behind the team, there is
apparently some question «as to whether this year's
freshman class will equal last year's frosh in numbers
and spirit at tonight's pajamarino. Their numbers
were noticeably thin at the Santa Clara rally. What
about tonight?

much to worry about.
A hunk of Dick Firendlich's column before the
U.S.F. game ran, "Incidentally, the statisticians are
pointing out that Stanford hasn't won the opening
game of its season since the Vow Boys beat San Jose
State in 1935."
Such was the general trend of predictions by the
majority—the vast majority—of typewriter hounds.
Stanford had a "fair" team but they would probably
take a trimming anyway.
Not so with Bill Leiser, who went out on the pre
diction limb when he wrote, "Stanford, it is our hunch,
will defeat U.S.F., though all know advantages lie
with the Dons. . . . It's just our hunch that the Clark
Shaughnessy type of football will have a lucky day and
get away."

W/ITH our juicy victory over U.S.F., most of the
writers attempted to jump on the week-old band
wagon, and quotes about how they "had known what
was going to happen all the time" came thick and
fast. But when it came to next week's game with
Oregon—well ..."
Sportswriter Art Rosenbaum wrote, "Not that
we begrudge Stanford its sweet hour of light and
sunshine, but the lack of a few touchdowns might be
an equal signal for disappearance of all the back
slapping that now goes on."
Again Bill Leiser went out on the limb and picked
Stanford to win. We did. Remember?

PY the time we had come to face Santa Clara the
story had become monotonous. Before the game
Floyd Russell quoted the odds 10-7 in favor of Santa
Clara. Grantland Rice picked Santa Clara over Stan
ford. In fact, he even picked Washington State over
us last week.
Not so Bill Leiser. From his typewriter came, "Let's
say Stanford over Santa Clara. Everyone else is pick
ing Santa Clara, so what good would it do us to join
in with the rest of the crew, even if we turned out
to be right." Which is just Leiser's subtle way of say
ing that he thinks that the Cards had and have the
best team. He has done it before every game we have
played.
So to Bill Leiser we all owe some sort of thank
you's. It takes a lot of journalistic grit to pick an
entirely new and inexperienced team when all the
other writers are placing that team in the haven't-got
a-chance column.

And speaking of getting behind the team, there is
apparently some question «as to whether this year's
freshman class will equal last year's frosh in numbers
and spirit at tonight's pajamarino. Their numbers
were noticeably thin at the Santa Clara rally. What
about tonight?
FRIEND IN NEED—FRIEND INDEED
AS the old, old saying goes: "A friend in need is a
friend indeed." So let's take a couple of minutes
off and give a few deep-felt thanks to a true Stanford
friend.
His name—Bill Leiser. His occupation—writing a
sports column for the San Francisco Chronicle.
If you can hark back to around September 27 of
this fall, you will perhaps remember that, in the
eyes of sports writers, Stanford had little of encour
agement to which they might look forward in the
coming gridiron battles. There were "a few of last
year's not-so-good" players back on the Farm, and—
oh, yes—a bunch of "pretty green sophomores."
Nope; the sports writers figured Stanford wasn't
much to worry about.
