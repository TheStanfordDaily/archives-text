# CAMPUS OPINION
## WELL!! 
### 
r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
We approve of the lack of water bags; we even
approve of the lack of false alarms and of the way
Encina is being kept clean and beautiful this year.
However, we wonder if this is a result of a law
abiding spirit or if it comes from inertia and disin
terest in campus affairs. The absence of freshman
men at the rallies makes us think it is the latter.
"We" are taking a stand! Where ARE the fresh
man men at the rallies? What spirit there is, is goodâ€”
in fact, darned good. But we need quantity as well as
quality to put this thing over. Is it a lack of realiza
tion of the glories of an untied, unbeaten team?
Come on fellas, now's your chance to cheer on an
already winning team to bigger and better victories
(which has not always been Stanford's lot). Especially
important is tonight's S.C. rally and Pajamarino. After
all, what is the Pajamarino without the freshmen?
Nothing! It IS the Frosh!
Signed,
Two Disgruntled Sophomores
