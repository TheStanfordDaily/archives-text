# WILLKIE NO OCTOPUS
## 
### 
r pHE EDITOR. SIR:
Monday's Campus Opinion carries a letter warn
ing Stanford women against that utilities octopus, W.
Willkie. I feel that the letter should not go unan
swered, even though I feel that Mr. Elder (the writer)
is probably kidding when he flings such a backwoods
political argument at a collegiate audience.
The American people and their "bondage" by utili
ties companies is a New Deal theme. If such thralldom
exists it is certainly a strange state when it is con
sidered that utility commissions tell a utility com
pany just what it can and cannot do. Companies are
not at liberty to charge scandalous rates or abandon
unprofitable areas.
Willkie has represented in the course of his career
both rich and poor, both employer and employee. The
fact is that Willkie has done a pretty good job for
most of the people he represented. Now Willkie
wants to represent the American people—not just cer
tain favored groups—but the whole people—giving his
segment of the body politic the squarest shake possible.
By a succession of "emergencies" Roosevelt steadily
appropriated power (none of which has been relin
quished); he seeks to make the nation dependent on
one man alone; he seeks to make the nation class
conscious—thus he destroys democracy while giving
it lip-service. He allies himself with Boss "I Am the
Law" Hague (a man with whom a court-packer could
easily see eye to eye) and similar municipal corrup
tionists while again giving lip-service to democracy.
Willkie can give more than lip-service. He has
LIVED a democratic life, he has been a life-long lib
eral—a consistent advocate of civil liberties. He has
approved the social reforms of the present admin
istration.
Let me quote from Josiah Gilbert Holland:
"God give us men. The time demands
Strong minds, great hearts, true faith, and willing
hands. . .
"Men who have honor; men who will not lie;
Men who can stand before a demagogue
And damn his treacherous flatteries without wink-
Walt Shatford
