# 'Don Giovanni' Is Again S.F. Opera Triumph
## 
### 
For I lie* second time this season
the San Francisco Opera Company
has scored a triumph with Mozart.
There are a great many operas on
the subject of Don Juan and his
amours, hut Mozart's "Don Gio
vanni" is unapproachable, which
Monday night's performance clearly
demonstrated.
Ezio Pinza as the Don not only
field the house with his rich, mel
low bass, but looked and acted the
part of the handsome scoundrel as
well. Elisabeth Rethberg in the role
of Donna Anna played the heroine
with her customary well controlled,
powerful soprano.
SCHIPA ABSENT
At the last minute a change of cast
had to be made because the airplane
on which Tito Schipa was to come
from Panama to San Francisco was
detained due to storms. Alessio de
Paolis sang Don Ottavio, Donna
Anna's fiance. Alexander Kipnis
again demonstrated his Chaliapin
like bass as Leporello, servant and
general scapegoat to Giovanni. He
brought out all the comedy of his
role in the aria, '"Dearest Donna,
This Little Register."
Elsa Zabranska made her San
Francisco debut as Donna Elvira,
one of Giovanni's jilted lovers, and
completed the heroic triumvirate of
Donna Anna, Don Ottavio, and
Donna Elvira.
SUPPORTING CAST GOOD
George Cehanovsky and Margit
Bokor received waves of applause
for Masetto and Zerlina's duet, prob
ably the most famous piece in the
opera, "La ci Dorem la Mano."
Lorenzo Alvary took the part of Don
Pedro, the commandant and Donna
Anna's father.
The staging and sets were handled
with ease in spite of the ten scenes
and only two acts in which the opera
is set, with the revolving stage turn
ing the set from the fourth to the
fifth scene (the ballroom scene) of
the first act, avoiding any interrup
tion of music or action. Erich Leins
dorf conducted.â€”Adams
