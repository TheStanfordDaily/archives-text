PETAIN and Adolph
Hitler met in a railroad car
somewhere in France yesterday to
discuss conquered France's role in
the "New Europe."
It was a stirring moment when
the 84-year-old hero of Verdun
came face to face with a former en
emy corporal who now is in the po
sition to dictate terms.
Any discussion of what was said
between the two today is mere spec
ulation on the part of the writer, but
it is known definitely that Petain
has been stubborn in submitting to
Nazi demands.
Some significance may be placed
on the fact that Hitler conferred
with Vice-Premier Laval and then
separately with Petain. Laval has
been one of the leading exponents
of appeasement in France, and it is
possible that he is not perfectly
cordial with Petain.
But the fact that there may not
be unity in the leadership of the
provisional French government
cannot be interpreted as an indica
tion that at lesat some Frenchmen
will favor the ultimate terms.
Hitler's peace cannot he one that
any Frenchman brought up to
hate and distrust a German, will
like.

days ago, the Nazi gov
k ernmcnt announced that foreign
correspondents in Berlin would not
be permitted to send dispatches after
11 o'clock at night, and that no dis
patches containing hints as to the
implications of the present diplo
matic negotiations would be toler
ated.
Since the disclosure of this new
law, news from the German capital
has been anything but enlightening.
Correspondents who want to keep
♦ heir jobs in Berlin no longer at
tempt to interpret news.
Last night the first indication of
what the conferences between Hitler
and Petain, and between Hitler and
Franco, might mean came from Ber
lin—through the strictest censorship
yet imposed upon writers there.
"It is entirely natural that the
Spain of Franco should feel itself
allied with the constructive Axis
powers . . . the wounds inflicted
upon Spain by England in earlier
history give her a vital interest in
the nature of the future peace."
the only official statement said.
Beyond this, correspondents in
Berlin either did not know or were
not permitted to speculate.
A "wound inflicted upon Spain by
England" quite probably is a refer
ence to Britain's conquest of the
fortress of Gibraltar. Just what
other "wounds" the spokesman had
in mind is not clear. j
A statement in Madria maintained
that "the Axis is fighting the same
power (Britain) which opposed
Franco in the Spanish Civil War.
The Axis powers showed during the
Spanish Civil War that they were
brothers-in-arms (with Spain) and
Spain as a natural necessity contin
ued on the side of the Axis."
Gibraltar is likely to become a
major Axis objective during the
coming months whether or not
Franco officially enters the wai\ It
is possible that he will permit Ger
man and Italian troops to operate
from Spanish soil in an attack or
siege on Gibraltar without, actually
declaring war and permit the Italian
navy to use bases in the Spanish
owned Balearic Isles off the South
ern Mediterranean Coast. From
every report, it. looks like Spain is
about to jump on what it thinks is
the band-wagon.

Russia remains the big question
mark in the Far East and in the
Near East. Through the efficient
Soviet censorship yesterday came the
prediction that Russia and Japan
were about to make up differences
after years of border incidents and
mutual distrust.
When such an agreement in ac
tually reached, it will be headline
news; until it is it will be looked
upon as just another rumor. But
some look for substantiation of this
rumor this time because it is felt
that Russia seeks to make friends
now with any possible enemy.
