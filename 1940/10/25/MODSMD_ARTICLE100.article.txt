# Sport Clothes Acquire More Feminine Line
## 
### 
Following the trend away from
severe or mannish clothes, women
have also feminized their sports ap
parel, discarding short shorts, cu
lottes, and other former favorites.
Tennis and badminton courts,
with the latter enjoying a tremen
dous popularity boom, are now the
background for a variation of the
old tennis dresses. Now short, full
skirts are being worn in both one
and two-piece styles. Silk jersey is
often used, but the old cotton mate
rials are still popular.
Shorts will always be liked by
women because they are so com
fortable, but lately they have been
hidden under skirts that button
down the front.
BOWLING INFLUENCE
With the advent of a new bowling
alley in Paly, the women are taking
this indoor sport more seriously.
Corduroy skirts, widely flared,
make the best bowling costume,
with other full skirts next in popu
larity. And the alleys are one place
where Stanford women may aban
don their silk stockings in favor of
socks; it saves runs, too.
The designers are finally making
golf dresses in the lower price
bracket that are practical. Gabar
dine is a good material for winter,
as is corduroy. The one-piece styles
have pockets in the skirt and full
shoulders for swinging. The jacket
and skirt outfits have big pockets
in the jackets.
SKIS NOT OUT YET
Although skiing weather hasn't
arrived yet, snow-enthusiasts can
get their wardrobes together for the
first icy spell. Gabardine has re
placed wool almost entirely because
it is lighter and more water-resist
ant. The pants are the same style
as before with tailored gabardine
shirts.
Waterproof ski jackets that have
been so popular with men have been
adopted for feminine wear. An ad
dition is gloves of the same water
proof material.
Ice skating still offers the most
attractive costume of any sport. The
short one-piece dresses are trimmed
in every possible material from
white fur to electrified lamb.
