# Tradition of Silk Stockings Vetoes Knee Length Skirts

Skirts! What's to be said about them?
They're the hardy perennial of every campus wardrobe from Maine
to California. Properly combined with assorted jackets, sweaters, shirts,
and blouses, they make up about !>() per cent of that exclusive Stanford

ash ion category, Quad Clothes.
Biggest news about them in the
East this fall is thaf they're short.
No, we don't mean 19 or 20 inches,
we mean way up above the knee!
College girls at such supposedly dig
nified institutions as Smith and
V'assar and. debutantes in all the
better social circles parade calmly
iround campus and golf course
•vitb their knees on view and their
L-alvcs colorfully sheathed in high
wool stockings.
These knee-length creations come
in practically every color, style, and
sports material. Wool, gabardine,
flannel, plaids, stripes, solid colors,
flared, pored, pleated—they're all the
latest thing so long as they stop at
the knee. Indispensable accessory is
a pair of knee-length wool stockings
in matching or contrasting color or
colors.
IN BETWEEN' LENGTH
Now that that's out of the way, the
sad or happy truth, depending on
your point of view, is that they
aren't very likely to catch on at
Stanford. Western campuses as a
group haven't gone wild over the
style, and the silk stockings and
other traditions on the Farm pretty
much rule them out.
As for the regular campus and
sports skirt this year, it too is in
clined to be shorter than last year,
coming just far enough below the
knee to avoid that awkward
"chopped-in-two" look. All the old
stand-by materials are as good as
ever, with wool gaberdine making a
special bid for popularity.
FEATURE PLEATS
Variety in styling is introduced by
the increasing importance of in
verted, box, and kick pleats in all
types of skirts. Straight skirts, flares,
gores (stitched or otherwise), and all
the possible variations of bias cut
ting are still quite the thing, how
ever.
All the usual fall and winter col
ors are very much in evidence, with
special emphasis on the very bright
shades, especially red. Then too,
there was never a more stylish sea
son for plaids, the louder the better.
