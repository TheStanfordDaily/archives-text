# Fall Lines Feature 'Sapling Silhouette'
## 
### 
Miss America, 1940. is still "pen
cil slim" according to fashion ex
perts. Her lines are as young and
athletic as those of Miss 1939, but
a new name has come into vogue for
the 1940 figure—the "sapling sil
houette."
Although the 1940 figure is basi
cally the same, trim and tailored—
there are two new styles that show
it off to a greater advantage than
ever before. These are the "sweater
silhouette" and the "draped hip
line"; both arc designed to slen
derize the waistline and give the
modern woman more charm and
femininity.
