# Designers Maintain Black Best For Dressy Coats
## 
### 
Good coats arc predominantly black again this year. Fitted coats
lead the way and almost ail have some sort of trim, either hlack vel- ;
vet or fur. In fact, fur seems to have caught on with a bigger bang this
year than ever before. One sees i. almost everywhere—on muffs and
coat collars, trimming hems, and cull?', and above all, hats.

in the dressy-sports class, the
classic beige tweed trimmed with
lynx-dyed white fox, or genuine
lynx if you can afford it, is still
leading. This coat is being seen as
often with straight lines as fitted,
and is the ideal top piece for wool
dresses and casual silks.
Sport coats have the traditionally
straight lines and are almost in
variably double - breasted, though
the single-breasted long coat seems
to be coming right along as part of
the new mannish trend.
Tweeds, tweeds, tweeds. That's
the inevitable in these informal
coats. Scotch, English, the beautiful
new Irish tweeds, and the faithful
herringbone are all good. Velvet
trims on tweed coats are less im
portant than they were last year.
They tend to dress up a coat more
than campus wear calls for, but are
gaining favor in the dressy-sports
class.
PLAIDS AGAIN POPULAR
The untrimmed coat, however, is
not only more practical to knock
about in, but it is more in keeping
with that casual effect. Loud plaids
are again popular, but for heaven's
fjake don't mix plaids or tweeds
among themselves or with each
other! Nip in the waist of a good
looking plaid coat, add a velvet col
lar, and you have again a smart
dressy sports coat.
Suit top-coats vary from three
quarter length to the full length,
and are nearly always broad-shoul
dered, wide-lapeled, and cut with
straight, immaculate lines. Flawless
tailoring is all-important in sports
coats this year. Incidentally, rag-*
lan sleeves are quite passe—get that
military look!
One of the leading stores in Palo
Alto, noted as a style-setter, and
famous for its unique but always i
stunning college fashions, is featur
ing three startling innovations in the
way of coats.
NEW MOHAIR COATS
The first of these is a belted mo- !
hair coat in beige with broad, broad
shoulders and wide lapels. It's
caught in at the waistline, and has |
open impressed pleats in the full I
skirt. This is a big coat—for a not
too big girl. Ideal for blustery j
weather — especially at a football
uame—over suits and wool dresses, j
II you have a weakness for those
delightful extravagances, weaken in
this direction.
1 he same store is also showing a I
white mohair coat lined in either
kelly green or lipstick red flannel.
Cut straight down the front, this
job has a round neek, color-lined
pockets which have the lining peep
ing through at just the right places,
and a hood-scarf of the same color
as the lining.
Third on the list is an oatmeal
colored camel's-hair full-length coat
for evening. Believe it or not! The
coat has very broad lapels and built
shoulders, a gathered belt in back
and two stunning gold buttons in
the front. If you have the courage
of your convictions, by all means
try something like this.
GABARDINE FOR RAIN
The rains haven't come yet, but
some of the more foresighted Paly
shops are well ahead of the season.
r° slosh around in the Farm's mud
you need one of the new gabardine
fly - front rain coats that look as
though Ihey came straight out of
"Esquire." Hoods are not as popu
lar thus far as they were last year.
Perhaps they re too, too feminine.
At any rate, you II simply have to
let your hair droop, or get a "bucket
hat."
Don t forget to keep your eyes
open for pockets. As if you could
miss them! Huge pockets and loads
of them are seen on everything that
has room for them. Gold buttons
and even occasional epaulette ef
fects on shoulders continue to keep
us military minded. And just in
case you haven't already got one,
be sure to get a lapel gadget—with
a patriotic flavor—to replace that
Roosevelt or Willkie button after
Nov. 5.

herringbone are all good. Velvet
trims on tweed coats are less im
portant than they were last year.
They tend to dress up a coat more
than campus wear calls for, but are
gaining favor in the dressy-sports
class.
PLAIDS AGAIN POPULAR
The untrimmed coat, however, is
not only more practical to knock
about in, but it is more in keeping
with that casual effect. Loud plaids
are again popular, but for heaven's
fjake don't mix plaids or tweeds
among themselves or with each
other! Nip in the waist of a good
looking plaid coat, add a velvet col
lar, and you have again a smart
dressy sports coat.
Suit top-coats vary from three
quarter length to the full length,
and are nearly always broad-shoul
dered, wide-lapeled, and cut with
straight, immaculate lines. Flawless
tailoring is all-important in sports
coats this year. Incidentally, rag-*
lan sleeves are quite passe—get that
military look!
One of the leading stores in Palo
Alto, noted as a style-setter, and
famous for its unique but always i
stunning college fashions, is featur
ing three startling innovations in the
way of coats.
NEW MOHAIR COATS
The first of these is a belted mo- !
hair coat in beige with broad, broad
shoulders and wide lapels. It's
caught in at the waistline, and has |
open impressed pleats in the full I
skirt. This is a big coat—for a not
too big girl. Ideal for blustery j
weather — especially at a football
uame—over suits and wool dresses, j
II you have a weakness for those
delightful extravagances, weaken in
this direction.
1 he same store is also showing a I
white mohair coat lined in either
kelly green or lipstick red flannel.
Cut straight down the front, this
job has a round neek, color-lined
pockets which have the lining peep
ing through at just the right places,
and a hood-scarf of the same color
as the lining.
Third on the list is an oatmeal
colored camel's-hair full-length coat
for evening. Believe it or not! The
coat has very broad lapels and built
shoulders, a gathered belt in back
and two stunning gold buttons in
the front. If you have the courage
of your convictions, by all means
try something like this.
GABARDINE FOR RAIN
The rains haven't come yet, but
some of the more foresighted Paly
shops are well ahead of the season.
r° slosh around in the Farm's mud
you need one of the new gabardine
fly - front rain coats that look as
though Ihey came straight out of
"Esquire." Hoods are not as popu
lar thus far as they were last year.
Perhaps they re too, too feminine.
At any rate, you II simply have to
let your hair droop, or get a "bucket
hat."
Don t forget to keep your eyes
open for pockets. As if you could
miss them! Huge pockets and loads
of them are seen on everything that
has room for them. Gold buttons
and even occasional epaulette ef
fects on shoulders continue to keep
us military minded. And just in
case you haven't already got one,
be sure to get a lapel gadget—with
a patriotic flavor—to replace that
Roosevelt or Willkie button after
Nov. 5.
Good coats arc predominantly black again this year. Fitted coats
lead the way and almost ail have some sort of trim, either hlack vel- ;
vet or fur. In fact, fur seems to have caught on with a bigger bang this
year than ever before. One sees i. almost everywhere—on muffs and
coat collars, trimming hems, and cull?', and above all, hats.

in the dressy-sports class, the
classic beige tweed trimmed with
lynx-dyed white fox, or genuine
lynx if you can afford it, is still
leading. This coat is being seen as
often with straight lines as fitted,
and is the ideal top piece for wool
dresses and casual silks.
Sport coats have the traditionally
straight lines and are almost in
variably double - breasted, though
the single-breasted long coat seems
to be coming right along as part of
the new mannish trend.

military look!
One of the leading stores in Palo
Alto, noted as a style-setter, and
famous for its unique but always i
stunning college fashions, is featur
ing three startling innovations in the
way of coats.
NEW MOHAIR COATS
The first of these is a belted mo- !
hair coat in beige with broad, broad
shoulders and wide lapels. It's
caught in at the waistline, and has |
open impressed pleats in the full I
skirt. This is a big coat—for a not
too big girl. Ideal for blustery j
weather — especially at a football
uame—over suits and wool dresses, j
II you have a weakness for those
delightful extravagances, weaken in
this direction.
1 he same store is also showing a I
white mohair coat lined in either
kelly green or lipstick red flannel.
Cut straight down the front, this
job has a round neek, color-lined
pockets which have the lining peep
ing through at just the right places,
and a hood-scarf of the same color
as the lining.
Third on the list is an oatmeal
colored camel's-hair full-length coat
for evening. Believe it or not! The
coat has very broad lapels and built
shoulders, a gathered belt in back
and two stunning gold buttons in
the front. If you have the courage
of your convictions, by all means
try something like this.
GABARDINE FOR RAIN
The rains haven't come yet, but
some of the more foresighted Paly
shops are well ahead of the season.
r° slosh around in the Farm's mud
you need one of the new gabardine
fly - front rain coats that look as
though Ihey came straight out of
"Esquire." Hoods are not as popu
lar thus far as they were last year.
Perhaps they re too, too feminine.
At any rate, you II simply have to
let your hair droop, or get a "bucket
hat."
Don t forget to keep your eyes
open for pockets. As if you could
miss them! Huge pockets and loads
of them are seen on everything that
has room for them. Gold buttons
and even occasional epaulette ef
fects on shoulders continue to keep
us military minded. And just in
case you haven't already got one,
be sure to get a lapel gadget—with
a patriotic flavor—to replace that
Roosevelt or Willkie button after
Nov. 5.
Good coats arc predominantly black again this year. Fitted coats
lead the way and almost ail have some sort of trim, either hlack vel- ;
vet or fur. In fact, fur seems to have caught on with a bigger bang this
year than ever before. One sees i. almost everywhere—on muffs and
coat collars, trimming hems, and cull?', and above all, hats.

in the dressy-sports class, the
classic beige tweed trimmed with
lynx-dyed white fox, or genuine
lynx if you can afford it, is still
leading. This coat is being seen as
often with straight lines as fitted,
and is the ideal top piece for wool
dresses and casual silks.
Sport coats have the traditionally
straight lines and are almost in
variably double - breasted, though
the single-breasted long coat seems
to be coming right along as part of
the new mannish trend.
Tweeds, tweeds, tweeds. That's
the inevitable in these informal
coats. Scotch, English, the beautiful
new Irish tweeds, and the faithful
herringbone are all good. Velvet
trims on tweed coats are less im
portant than they were last year.
They tend to dress up a coat more
than campus wear calls for, but are
gaining favor in the dressy-sports
class.
PLAIDS AGAIN POPULAR
The untrimmed coat, however, is
not only more practical to knock
about in, but it is more in keeping
with that casual effect. Loud plaids
are again popular, but for heaven's
fjake don't mix plaids or tweeds
among themselves or with each
other! Nip in the waist of a good
looking plaid coat, add a velvet col
lar, and you have again a smart
dressy sports coat.
Suit top-coats vary from three
quarter length to the full length,
and are nearly always broad-shoul
dered, wide-lapeled, and cut with
straight, immaculate lines. Flawless
tailoring is all-important in sports
coats this year. Incidentally, rag-*
lan sleeves are quite passe—get that
military look!
