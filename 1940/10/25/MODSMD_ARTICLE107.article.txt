# Peppy Post Cards Feature Pastels
## 
### 
Terracotta is the striking now
color for stationery this fall, and if
is bound for popularity for the let
ters home and to "him." Crane, the
famous stationers, have put out their
new letter and note paper in this
shade.
Sure to start a major rage are the
new correspondence post cards put
out by hat on. These glorified penny
post cards come in pastels or white
bordered with Flaming red for that
true Stanford spirit. There's no
bothering with envelopes, and you'll
be able to dash off a note or two be
tween classes.
The Bookstore is displaying
Christmas note paper, an idea that
gives Yuletide greetings a little
more of the personal touch. And,
not to rush the holiday season, bul
they're taking orders now for
Christmas cards -which should con
siderably lessen that Christmas
shopping-cramming for finals rush
at the end of the quarter.
