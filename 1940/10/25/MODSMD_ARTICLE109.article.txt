# Sensible Hats Predominate In Fall Shows
## 
### 
Suit yourself that's the secret of
millinery lor fall, according to ex
perts from Dache to Dobbs to the
hat bar clerk in a downtown depart
ment store.
For it's accommodation to pompa
dours and this year's version of up
swept hairdo's that determines
whether headgear is brimmed, off
the-face, a beret, a calot, or a sailor.
The only rules laid down by the
stylists concern the appropriateness
of fabric and trimming for the time
of day 01 the occasion.
Glamor, too, has given away to a
more sensitive trend, and hats for
late fall and winter may be suave,
but they are never self-conscious.
FELTS COMING UP
Going through the day will find
felts coming up for morning, casual
spectator sports, and matter-of-fact
afternoons. Strollers, the snap brims,
the bowlers, are still in the fore,
with the pork-pie variation leading
the field. Next comes the calot, a
skullcap variation in felt or suede
with a gay quill: the berets, tailored
to keep their shape, are made of
felt, and some are made with a deco
rated inner band that encourages
ofi'-the-face styles.
SAILORS POPULAR
Sailors are popular for afternoon.
One, a Breton type, is of natural
wool, faced with black velvet and
fashioned with a triangle to fit the
contour of the back of the head.
The crown is crushed, and held so
by short black velvet cord. Another
is a simple skull cap of black felt,
with a fold of stiffened velvet tacked
on to the front for a brim, and with
it is worn a veil of coarse black net,
large enough to reach to the shoul
ders*.
Fur is used in tiny toques, usually
on a backing of costume velvet,
while feathers appear more gen
erally as pert pill boxes in red or
green or blue.
Veils? Yes, but judiciously. Only
for dressy afternoon millinery. Gone,
stylists say, are the days when veils
wers "used regardless."

Going through the day will find
felts coming up for morning, casual
spectator sports, and matter-of-fact
afternoons. Strollers, the snap brims,
the bowlers, are still in the fore,
with the pork-pie variation leading
the field. Next comes the calot, a
skullcap variation in felt or suede
with a gay quill: the berets, tailored
to keep their shape, are made of
felt, and some are made with a deco
rated inner band that encourages
ofi'-the-face styles.
SAILORS POPULAR
Sailors are popular for afternoon.
One, a Breton type, is of natural
wool, faced with black velvet and
fashioned with a triangle to fit the
contour of the back of the head.
The crown is crushed, and held so
by short black velvet cord. Another
is a simple skull cap of black felt,
with a fold of stiffened velvet tacked
on to the front for a brim, and with
it is worn a veil of coarse black net,
large enough to reach to the shoul
ders*.
Fur is used in tiny toques, usually
on a backing of costume velvet,
while feathers appear more gen
erally as pert pill boxes in red or
green or blue.
Veils? Yes, but judiciously. Only
for dressy afternoon millinery. Gone,
stylists say, are the days when veils
wers "used regardless."
Suit yourself that's the secret of
millinery lor fall, according to ex
perts from Dache to Dobbs to the
hat bar clerk in a downtown depart
ment store.
For it's accommodation to pompa
dours and this year's version of up
swept hairdo's that determines
whether headgear is brimmed, off
the-face, a beret, a calot, or a sailor.
The only rules laid down by the
stylists concern the appropriateness
of fabric and trimming for the time
of day 01 the occasion.
Glamor, too, has given away to a
more sensitive trend, and hats for
late fall and winter may be suave,
but they are never self-conscious.
