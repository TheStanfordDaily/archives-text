Stanford generated enough spirit last night to snatch up 4,000 football
teams and hurl them right into the Rose Bowl.
That's the way Paul Speigle, ex-yell king, put it. And that's the way
it was.
Those bobbing pajamaed frosh, those loaded convertibles, station
wagons and model T's, those firecrackers, those flaming torches fired up

a crowd that nearly went mad in,
the annual pre-S.C. game pajama
rino.
'NOISIEST RIOT'
That hopping mob jitterbugged
its way down the Row from the Fiji
house to the Pavilion in the noisiest
riot that ever hit this place.
They "Roared with '44" as Coach
Clark Shaughnessy sedately stepped
before the mike to address the
gang. He put it,like nobody but
Clark Shaughnessy would put itâ€”
simply and right on the nose:
"The boys on the team are all
fighters and I like fighters. We're
looking forward to one whale of a
football game Saturday."
POP' CONFIDENT
Football's immortal Glenn S.
"Pop" Warner told the rooters all
his doubts about Coach Shaugh
nessy and Stanford's chances have
been removed.
"The Stanford team is being very
capably handled and coached.
There never has been so much got
ten out of this system as Shaugh
nessy gets now. I have confidence
in the boys' ability to come through
Saturday, and I want to see Stan
ford in the Rose Bowl."
Spiegle, one - time Card cheer
leader and present drama critic of
the San Francisco Chronicle, wowed
them with his interpretation of a
Stanford alumnus returning to the
Farm for an evening to address a
pre-S.C. rally. Next, he got in the
groove with Stanford's own "Give
'Em the Axe."
ENCINA STARS
Student Body President Bruce
Jcssup introduced Chuck Johnson,
U.S.C. student president, who
spoke briefly and concluded with, "I
know as well as you do who's go
ing to win Saturday."
Following the rally, Roble ad
journed to Roble and nightie-ed
Encinamen stormed the ivy hall to
serenade the queens, and then took
off for Paly and a free show at the
Fox Varsity.
