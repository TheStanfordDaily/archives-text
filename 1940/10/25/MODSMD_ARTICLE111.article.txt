# Palominos Join Farm Classics
## 
### 
Shoe styles for campus wear re
main pretty much the same year in
and year out because fashion de
signers seem to have found out that
once a coed is attached to a com
fortable and simple design, she will
cling to it forever more, viz., saddle
shoes.
This year, however, shoe designers
have pulled something new out of
their hats which seems to be catching
on to a permanent place in the
coed's wardrobe. "Palomino" is the
name of the newcomer, so named
because of the creamy pale brown
of the leather resembling the horse
which is classified as a Palomino.
Aside from the color, which is
very good this year, as browns seem
to be making a spectacular come
back in shoe styles, the Palomina
has in addition the distinguishing
features of comfort, styles, weara

bility and all-Americanism.
Most popular style of the Palo
mino is the fringed version which
complements the Indian influence in
American dress this year. Fringe
trimming, short but distinctive, gives
a moccasin touch over the instep
of the shoe and adds to the strap.
The heel is a combination of a
slight wedge and a platform sole,
again scoring a hit for comfort. And,
Palominos are washable.
A variation on the Palomino is
the doggie (fringed shoes are called
chaps) by Joyce of California (who
started the whole thing). The dog
gie is in a saddle brown and has
dog-collar studding on the strap.
This studding also includes a small
brass plate on which you may have
your name engraved.
Saddle shoes still hold the record
for the most popular all-round cam
pus shoe.
