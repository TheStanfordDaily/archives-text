# Huge Purses Cop Spotlight
## New Mode Adds Length, Simplicity 
### 
We like them long, lean, and lank
I this year—great, huge purses you
can tuck under your arm, and use
to haul around two volumes of
Chancer, a bottle cpener, and a.col
lansible armchairs
Designers probably swiped the
j idea for these roomy masterpieces
'rom soldiers' knapsacks, or maybe
from laundry bags, but anvway they
are here to stay . . . and the women
appreciate the added room. You
don't have to worry any longer about
getting everything you own into a
nurse; now you'll probibly have to
map out the interior before you can
I locate what von're looking for.
THREE-SIDE ZIPPER
One of the most popular everyday
models to carry along on your ex
peditions down the Quad is made
from plain saddle leather with a
brown zipper and a tassel. The same
style which incidentally zips around
three sides for convenience, comes
in autumnal shades of suede.
And now for those date evenings.
You probably better go down to
Paly and look at corde nurses —
that is, if you haven't seen them al
ready. Corde can be the most so
phisticated of purse material—ter
rifically plain, eye-catching in sim
plicity of design. Most models have
just the frame and clasp for trim
ming, and the pattern of the corde
for the basic design.
Here in date purses is where the
j urge for room comes to the fore,
i One corde purse, with a puflball of
, mink in the center for trimming, is
| about half a yard long and is car
! ried under the arm.
SHIRRED SUEDE
Suede is simply shirred and de
pends for its effect more on texture
than on fancy designs—this is the
season of good taste, you see. Most
purses have zippers, and side com
partments on either side of a cen
tral one—this is the season of con
venience.
Grosgain and suede are combined
in a purse that is draped like velvet
and gathered into contrasting insert
at the bottom of the purse. Any purse
made this way car stand up by itself
on the table.
Lines, with the exception of the
half-moon frame, are square.
One of the more novel purses had
the frame laced in and out to form
the main ornament. If you look hard
enough you may be able to find an
absolutely plain grey gabardine purse
as big as a saddlebag. Its broad ex
panse, devoid of ornament, would
form a wonderful vaunting ground
for your favorite monogram.
