# 1940 Farm Men Smooth But Jeans Still Popular
## 
### HAP EVERETT 
The stodgy Stanford rough plods
along in his rut.
For the nth consecutive season,
Farm men ignore downtown win
ch w displays of smart slacks, Ivy
League sport coats, and smooth ties,
rush to the back room for the latest
prices on Levi's.
Although the outfitting grapevine
lui;- Stanford in a smoother condi
tion than in any other recent year,
jeans are still basic (except of
couise for underpants). T-shirts
aren't giving way an inch and tan
.slip-over cashmeres are still tops
in sweaters.
SADDLES PREFERRED
Kegardless of season, weather, or
style, .saddle shoes are probably the
mo.st practical and popular on the
campus although the original Spal
dings have been all but snowed
under Ijy imitations. With about six
weeks' scuff these little gems really
reach a maximum in eclat. Mocca
; ins and sweat socks make another
good footwear combo.
Moleskins and dirty cords are still
around but the latter have seen
their day. namely the 'twenties and
the Ben Eastman-Vow Boys era.
White broadcloth shirts are worn
under a great variety of things.
Athletes that don't look like ath
lete- wear block "S" coat-sweaters
or liaveling jackets to prove 'it,
while more and more guys are top
puiv white .shirts with tan sweaters
of cashmere, Shetland, etc.
For the approaching winter, new
X 'lan-treated poplin finger-tip rain
coats are handy, and bucket hats,

I although most Stanford men don't
wear anything on the head but a
thick layer of Tiger.
JACKETS WARM
"Shorties," knee - length camel's
hair jackets, have been seen a lot
for the past year, 'they've got big
pockets and plenty of warmth.
Unlike the strict regimentation in
| shirt color over in Europe, shirts are
j coming out with more and more
\ stripe and color. There is a tendency
toward collars with points set lower
oil the neck and wider apart, slop
j ing with the coat line. Button
downs are staging a comeback.
Ties are loud; socks are Argyle.
GRIDDERS DOLL UP
With Stanford's static styles, the
1 biggest revolution here is on the
i gridiron. Last spring, with Hugh
| Gallarneau as mannequin. Clark
| Shaughnessy outfitted his squad in
the lightest and most practical uni
| forms ever seen. Not only are they
j good-looking football suits, but they
| allow for a maximum in efficiency
J on the field.
No designer will ever create a
j substitute for jeans and Stanford
j will hang onto its reputation of the
j "sloppiest campus in the country."
But what the hell, we've got the
â–  neatest football team in the coun-
I try, and if it comes to a fashion
showdown we've always got the
Chi Psi's.

Chalk beige and red are up as
particularly effective. When the basic
costume is in beige, the accessories
scream out in crimson.
