Wendell Willkie has broken into J
the fashion news! No, his wavy locks
haven't inspired a new hair style.
But, his name does appear on a new ,
black suede belt studded with square j
letters. No doubt this will cinch
Willkie.
Another gadget designed to let the
world know what side you're on is
a double W . . . "for Wendell Willkie,
for wit and wisdom, for a wonderful
whatnot to wear on your lapel," says j
Harper's Bazaar. Malvina Hoffman
designed them in red and blue ena- j
mel with a heavv gold eagle joining i
the W's. j
