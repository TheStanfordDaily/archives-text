Flowers in your hair. Almost a
"must" for that formal evening.
Yes, we know you've worn them
for years, and years. But don't de
spair. There are a number of differ
ent ways they can be worn—for
variety's sake, as well as beauty's.
The single gardenia, always effec
tive. is lovely worn at the side or—
if you have the right kind of face—
on top, almost even with your hair
line. Two or more flowers in a
ring around the back right above
your curls can be very effective.
And if you have a top-knot, just
for a crowning touch you might
cluster a few right behind it.

You can be heady, even if you
don't look like her, provided you
wear Suzy's new perfume "Ecarlate
de Suzy."
