## Man-Tailoring Ousts Frou-Frou For Typical Coed 
### 
Tliere were no accusations of
apple polkhing last week when a
Roble girl strolled into a Western
Civilization class, sporting a beige
..acket and skirt of similar herring
bone tweed and cut on the same
lines as the suit her professor hap
pened to be wearing. It was all
part of the bijigest (all sensation in
Campus clothes—coeds in men's ap
parel.
It began last spring, when an en
terprising Smith or Vassar girl dis
tinguished her frou-frou wardrobe
with a long, loose-fitting jacket, but
toned on the right side, made by a
college boys' tailor. Since then, it
has become more than a fad; it is a
style not» with a practical side. A
good jacket has a long life, particu
larly when it is cut for service and
utility.
BROAD SHOULDERS
A purposely loose fit keynotes the
style ol the new jackets. Shoulders
are as broad as those in the Indian
line-up. jackets end far below the
hip. Even the feminine versions for
the more conservative are copies of
these, the real thing. Their cut is
somewhat modified, the shoulders
narrower.
Jackets and sport coats are most
representative of the new trend. But
the style has crept into Campus
clothes of every variety. Little base
ball caps in red, blue, and brown
corduroy, adaptations of boxing
gloves for cold weather, and mas
culine sport shirts.
Stanford girls cling more to the
adaptation, rather than to the ex
treme styles. Their jackets vary the
original brown and beige with blue,
pink and bright red. The jackets
have* hand-stitching on the collars
and huge pockets.
< iENTLEMEN APPROVE
A very limited survey of mascu
line campus opinion proves that the
new style is approved—with reser
vations. One gentleman with a great
eleal of insight commented. "If the
girl is feminine enough, man-tai
lored clothes are wonderful, but she
must be completely feminine."
That is the only flaw in this, the
style of the season. Only the very
feminine can wear long jackets,
boys' shirts with any grace at all.
The style is well enough estab
-1 lished now so that it is no longer
daring.

pened to be wearing. It was all
part of the bijigest (all sensation in
Campus clothes—coeds in men's ap
parel.
It began last spring, when an en
terprising Smith or Vassar girl dis
tinguished her frou-frou wardrobe
with a long, loose-fitting jacket, but
toned on the right side, made by a
college boys' tailor. Since then, it
has become more than a fad; it is a
style not» with a practical side. A
good jacket has a long life, particu
larly when it is cut for service and
utility.
BROAD SHOULDERS
A purposely loose fit keynotes the
style ol the new jackets. Shoulders
are as broad as those in the Indian
line-up. jackets end far below the
hip. Even the feminine versions for
the more conservative are copies of
these, the real thing. Their cut is
somewhat modified, the shoulders
narrower.
Jackets and sport coats are most
representative of the new trend. But
the style has crept into Campus
clothes of every variety. Little base
ball caps in red, blue, and brown
corduroy, adaptations of boxing
gloves for cold weather, and mas
culine sport shirts.
Stanford girls cling more to the
adaptation, rather than to the ex
treme styles. Their jackets vary the
original brown and beige with blue,
pink and bright red. The jackets
have* hand-stitching on the collars
and huge pockets.

A very limited survey of mascu
line campus opinion proves that the
new style is approved—with reser
vations. One gentleman with a great
eleal of insight commented. "If the
girl is feminine enough, man-tai
lored clothes are wonderful, but she
must be completely feminine."
That is the only flaw in this, the
style of the season. Only the very
feminine can wear long jackets,
boys' shirts with any grace at all.
The style is well enough estab

daring.
