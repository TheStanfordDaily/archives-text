# Mexican Sandals Set New Fashion
## 
### 
Huaraches are fast setting a new
vogue in sports footwear in this
country.
In *1927 these Mexican sandals
were first imported commercially
into the United States. By 1934, they
were making their appearance at
smart resorts, and in 1933 and 1939
huaraches bee;.in.e a real factor in
Ihe shoe world to the extent they
influenced styles and designs of
domestic manufacturers both here
and abroad.
Strangely enough, in Mexico it
self these sandals are known only
to the poor, the peon, the Indian
and the peasant, who buy them from
the quaint sidewalk shop and street
vendor. The well-to-do Mexican
scorns the huarache. It remained
for the foreigner to discover them
for comfort and serviceability.
The most practical and popular
Mexican huarache is ihe steerhide
huarache made by the Zapotcc In
dians. The designs are endless, and
the Indian weavers, or huaracheros,
never seem to run out of ideas, for
they n.vver repeat a design. Actu
ally, each pair of steerhide huara
ches is an original model.
