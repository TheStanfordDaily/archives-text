# Campus Hair-do's Have Casual Air
## 
### 
Queens, let your hair down! Lend
your tresses a bit of that well
known glint in your eye, and don't
get it out of a bottle. There's no
innovation to take the place of the
old-fashioned brush. From being
simply awful, things can be awfully
simple, if you dare to follow the
crowd! It's all for being perfectly
natural with individual coiffures to
match your time-worn personality.
A curl here, a swirl there, or per
haps, to be just too ultra ultra, a
pompadour. If a ribbon catches his
fancy, it might bo in Stanford red,
or it might have your name im
printed to inevitably become a
household word. We're not so
ancient, but what a posy in the
hair is still tres chic.
Above all, don't blame me if the
latest campus poll rates you as
carelessly casual instead of casually
careless.
