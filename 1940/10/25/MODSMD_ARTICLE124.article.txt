# Pin Device Designed To Hold Corsages
## 
### 
Here is a new idea for those who
have trouble in pinning on orchids,
, gardenias, cornflowers or any other
I shoulder posy.
The usual habit is to stick one
i self or you do not have the flowers
; secure. An elastic and a pin between
! two large pearl knobs has been in
troduced to simplify this difficulty.
The elastic holds the flowers in place
, and the pin point gets buried in one
| of the decorative pearl ends.
