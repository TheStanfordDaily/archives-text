# European War Makes U.S. Designers Style Leaders
## 
### 
War in Europe has thrown new responsibilities 011 the shoulders of
American fashion designers. Ahmst over night since the fall of Paris,
New York has become the eenter to which smartly dressed women the
world over will henceforth turn f< r the latest word on style.
Who are the men and women destined to move into the spotlight

as creators of each season's newest
mode? Some of their names have
long been associated with the
clothes smart women wear, but fast
acquiring prominence are a host of
lesser lights determined to take
every advantage of the present op
portunity.
Among New Yortf s already well
established designers, whose crea
tions are taking over the glory for
merly reserved lor originals by
Schiaparelli, Luciene Lelong, and
Alix, Hattie Carnegie stands at the
top. Her American designs have
long been worshipped by the fash
ion-conscious world.
ROSENSTEIN, MONTEIL
Nettie Rosenstein more or less
created the classic "little black
dress," and her cocktail clothes are
featured by all the best stores and
magazines. This season she's taking
a special interest in evening clothes,
particularly of jersey.
Youthful flowing lines and cut
rather than trimming are the stock
in trade of Germaine Monteil, who
first introduced very tailored eve
ning suits. Both her day and eve
ning clothes remain classically sim
ple regardless of the fancy of a par
ticular season.
Helen Cookman has a passion for
tweeds that has made her one of the
best coat and suit designers in New
York. This year she's concentrating

on back accents for coats, and there
it; even a whisper of tweed for eve
ning wear.
Classic simplicity and flowing
drapery distinguish the lovely
"owns designed by Valentina. She,
toe, sticks more or less to elegant
restraint no matter what the season
dictate::.
Top ranking in the field of casual
clothes usually goes to Brigance, of
the giddy bathing suits, and to
Clare Potter, whose original hand
dyed colors distinguish her sports
clothes.
Fashion designing on the Pacific
Coast takes its cue from the famous
designers of Hollywood like Adrian,
Renee, and Howard Greer, but a
real fashion school is beginning to
develop independent of the movies.
Prominent among them are Pat
Perkins in the evening gown field,
Violet Tatum's daytime and cock
tail prints, and the suede fashions of
Voris. Marjory Montgomery, Irene
Berry, and Agnes are top-notchers
in designing active sports clothes,
spectators, and play suits.
Mabs of Hollywood, who invented
the last ex bathing suit, is probably
the best known swim suit and girdle
designer in the country. This year
she's introducing a series of suits in
Hawaiian (lower prints.
