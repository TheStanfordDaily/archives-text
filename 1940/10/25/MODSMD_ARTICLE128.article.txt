# American Designers Borrow Latest Motifs from Indians
## 
### 
America goes back lo the Redskins. American designers have re
discovered the Indians, and from the art of the earliest Americans comes
inspiration for one of the new and important style trends.
Especially suitable for Farm women, the new designs in the In
dian manner are beautifully adapted to casual clothes, and at the same

time strike a note of school
or enthusiastic Stanfordites. Li'l In
dian will find his little Indian sister
dressed in the appropriate tribal |
manner.
This doesn't mean that we may j
expect to see war bonnets of feath- 1
?rs, and moccasins running rampant
rom Quad to Cellar. The designers
have borrowed and skillfully adapted
Indian themes to produce designs j
that remain ieminine and in good !
taste, although their inspiration is
unmistakable.
Accessories are the main means of
expressing the Indian idea. Shoes, j
inspired by the fleet grace of In- ;
dian moccasins, have appeared that j
ire almost exact copies of those |
*vorn by natives. Others, for more
dress occasions, use Indian decora
tion on otherwise classic models.
For instance a dress pump may be
idorned with painted designs, or |
isc leather fringe or thong trim.
Buckskin and feathers also indi- j
jate Indian influence. Light and I

durable buckskin or calf appears in
jackets, purges, and belts, as well as
in shoes. Feathers in warpath colors
brighten hats, discreetly peeping
from beneath the brim, or flaunted
atop a pill-box.
Brilliant colors, dear to the Indian
brave, flash as trimming against
backgrounds in subtler buck and
grey. Warpaint red, blue, and yel
low, combined in geometrical design,
are splashed on a pillbox of grey
wool. For evening synthetic stones
in the same three colors form a pat
tern on a simply cut evening jacket
ol : calfskin.
For the more daring, there are
whole dresses in Indian red, or yel
low of the shade of Indian corn.
Jcwclery copies the ceremonial
bangles ot tribal chieftains. And the
gadgets are new—not. the well
known silver and turquoise variety
—but gold and silver bracelets in
molten swirls, simple and at the same
time primitive.

brighten hats, discreetly peeping
from beneath the brim, or flaunted
atop a pill-box.
Brilliant colors, dear to the Indian
brave, flash as trimming against
backgrounds in subtler buck and
grey. Warpaint red, blue, and yel
low, combined in geometrical design,
are splashed on a pillbox of grey
wool. For evening synthetic stones
in the same three colors form a pat
tern on a simply cut evening jacket
ol : calfskin.
For the more daring, there are
whole dresses in Indian red, or yel
low of the shade of Indian corn.
Jcwclery copies the ceremonial
bangles ot tribal chieftains. And the
gadgets are new—not. the well
known silver and turquoise variety
—but gold and silver bracelets in
molten swirls, simple and at the same
time primitive.
America goes back lo the Redskins. American designers have re
discovered the Indians, and from the art of the earliest Americans comes
inspiration for one of the new and important style trends.
Especially suitable for Farm women, the new designs in the In
dian manner are beautifully adapted to casual clothes, and at the same

time strike a note of school
or enthusiastic Stanfordites. Li'l In
dian will find his little Indian sister
dressed in the appropriate tribal |
manner.
This doesn't mean that we may j
expect to see war bonnets of feath- 1
?rs, and moccasins running rampant
rom Quad to Cellar. The designers
have borrowed and skillfully adapted
Indian themes to produce designs j
that remain ieminine and in good !
taste, although their inspiration is
unmistakable.
Accessories are the main means of
expressing the Indian idea. Shoes, j
inspired by the fleet grace of In- ;
dian moccasins, have appeared that j
ire almost exact copies of those |
*vorn by natives. Others, for more
dress occasions, use Indian decora
tion on otherwise classic models.
For instance a dress pump may be
idorned with painted designs, or |
isc leather fringe or thong trim.
Buckskin and feathers also indi- j
jate Indian influence. Light and I

durable buckskin or calf appears in
jackets, purges, and belts, as well as
in shoes. Feathers in warpath colors
brighten hats, discreetly peeping
from beneath the brim, or flaunted
atop a pill-box.
