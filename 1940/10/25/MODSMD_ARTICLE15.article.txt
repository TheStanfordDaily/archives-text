## 
### 
Presenting to the Tuesday Eve
ning Series audience a new world
of dance and music, Devi Dja and
her Bali-Java Dancers will perform
next Tuesday night at 7:30 in the
auditorium of Memorial Hall. A
native gamelan orchestra will also
appear on the stage playing rhyth
mic accompaniments on native in
struments including gongs, cym
bals, xylophones, Javanese violins,
war drums, and bamboo clappers.
Until recently, the Bali and Java
nese form of dance was a jealously
guarded secret. Only through
word-of-mouth accounts of tourists
and the writing of professional
globe-trotters was it possible to get
the faintest conception of an art
that accompanies every stage of a
native's life.
The troupe, with the addition of
men dancers, started three years
ago a tour that has included most
of Europe and the United States.
The program will be entirely repre
sentative of the background of the
Balinese and Javanese.
