# Sperry to Take Klystron to .NY
## 
### 
Because of national defense needs,
the Sperry Gyroscope Company of
San Carlos has announced" its re
moval to Garden City, N.Y. The
company will continue work there
on the klystron, a Stanford inven
tion.
Further development of the ultra
short wave device will continue here
at Stanford in both the physics and
engineering departments. Possibili
ties for the klystron in the fields of
aviation communication via land and
sea and for perfection in radio tele
vision are still being developed.
Seven research associates from the
Stanford Department of Physics arc
to move with the company. Profes
sor William Hansen, one of the in
ventors. will spend his sabbatical
year in the East with the company
and lecturing on the klystron theory
at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. Professor F. E. Ter
