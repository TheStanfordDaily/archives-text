# Hitler, Vichy Head Initiate Peace Move
## Petain Asks Release Of War Prisoners, Less Nazi Control 
### 
VICIIY, France. Oct. 24 (UP).—
Marshal Henri Philippe Petain, in
the same hlue uniform he wore on
the battleground of Verdun 24
years ago, met with Adolf Hitler
today to appeal for an "honorable
peace" for France from the Nazi
conqueror.
The aged Petain and the German
Chancellor met aboard Hitler's pri
vate railroad car—the same one in
which Hitler and Generalissimo
Francisco Franco of Spain conferred
yesterday —in the Nazi - occupied
zone of France, presumably near
Paris.
Reports circulated that Hitlej - may
be trying to organize a solid bloc in
Europe and then confront Britain
with:
I—A demand the British blockade
be lifted; or
2—A steiTi "peace ultimatum."
FIRST MEETING
Attending the conference, which
began at 3 p.m. and lasted more
than two hours, were German For
eign Minister Joachim von Ribben
trop and French Vice - Premier
Pierre Laval, who had talked with
the Nazi leaders at Fontainbleau
Tuesday and laid the groundwork
for today's conference.
It was the first time the 84-year
old Petain had entered the Nazi
occupied zone and it was his first
face-to-face meeting with Hitler.
In 1916 Petain was commanding
the defense of Verdun and Hitler
was a thin-faced obscure corporal
of the attacking Germans who fi
nally were thrown back by Petain's
strategy.
Petain had been "invited" to meet
with Hitler and Ribbentrop today.
It was Laval who brought hte invi
tation back to Vichy.
Laval did not accompany Marshal
Petain to today's meeting but trav
eled separately by automobile be
hind the Marshal on the three-hour
trip to the secret rendezvous.
POSSIBLE COLLABORATION
In their talk Hitler and Petain
were understood to have made an j
exhaustive survey of the possibili- j
ties of close French-German col- j
laboration.
They discussed, it was believed, j
whether a basis exists for Petain's
recent appeal to Hitler, to give j
France a permanent just peace j
"without punitive measures." In a '
recent manifesto Petain offered col- |
laboration if Hitler is just.
Standing in the way of this col- |
laboration has been the fact that
1,800.000 Frenchmen still are pris
oners of war in the hands of the I
Germans, the Vichy government
has not been allowed to return to I
Paris, and France is unable to put j
into operation the program of re- i
construction which she has drafted.
HIGH NAZIS ATTEND
Attending the meeting in addition
to Laval and Ribbentrop were high
Nazi military leaders.
Hitler was flanked not only by his
military and diplomatic chiefs but
his translators from the Wilhelm
' strasse. Petain was said to have
| been a stalwart figure as he stepped
j aboard Hitler's private car, ramrod
| like in his blue uniform and walking
| with alert step.
i Petain besides seeking release of
! French war prisoners and return of
the government to Paris, also is
seeking the relaxation or elimination
of the control between the Vichy
and Nazi-occupied zones of France
in order to allow free exchange of
surplus foodstuffs and facilitate food
| distribution as winter sets in.
FRANCE AS A POWER
All these matters must be taken
i into consideration before the Pe
tain government is ready to engage
in permanent, full collaboration v/ith
Germany.
Hitler, it is said, must recognize
France's responsibilities as a con
j tinental power.
Today's was only the second meet
] ing of the leaders of the French
and German states since the World
War. The first was when Premier
Edouard Daladier, now a prisoner
awaiting trial on "war guilt"
charges, went to Munich on that
fateful day in September of 1938,
