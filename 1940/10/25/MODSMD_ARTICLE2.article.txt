# Hitler, Vichy Head Initiate Peace Move
## Petain Asks Release Of War Prisoners, Less Nazi Control 
### 
VICIIY, France. Oct. 24 (UP).—
Marshal Henri Philippe Petain, in
the same hlue uniform he wore on
the battleground of Verdun 24
years ago, met with Adolf Hitler
today to appeal for an "honorable
peace" for France from the Nazi
conqueror.
The aged Petain and the German
Chancellor met aboard Hitler's pri
vate railroad car—the same one in
which Hitler and Generalissimo
Francisco Franco of Spain conferred
yesterday —in the Nazi - occupied
zone of France, presumably near
Paris.
Reports circulated that Hitlej - may
be trying to organize a solid bloc in
Europe and then confront Britain
with:
I—A demand the British blockade
be lifted; or
2—A steiTi "peace ultimatum."
FIRST MEETING
Attending the conference, which
began at 3 p.m. and lasted more
than two hours, were German For
eign Minister Joachim von Ribben
trop and French Vice - Premier
Pierre Laval, who had talked with
the Nazi leaders at Fontainbleau
Tuesday and laid the groundwork
for today's conference.
It was the first time the 84-year
old Petain had entered the Nazi
occupied zone and it was his first
face-to-face meeting with Hitler.
In 1916 Petain was commanding
the defense of Verdun and Hitler
was a thin-faced obscure corporal
of the attacking Germans who fi
nally were thrown back by Petain's
strategy.
Petain had been "invited" to meet
with Hitler and Ribbentrop today.
It was Laval who brought hte invi
tation back to Vichy.
