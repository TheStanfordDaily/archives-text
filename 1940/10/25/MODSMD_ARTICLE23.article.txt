# Shaughnessymen Hope to Choke Powerful Trojan Running Attack In Toughest Coast Tilt Tomorrow
## Fair Weather, Dry Field Forecast To Give Indians Chance to Spring Intricate Ground Attack, Passes 
### CHUCK SMITH 
By CHUCK SMITH

To choke as best they can the undeniably powerful running attack of
Coach Howard Jones' invading Trojans while they get some touchdowns
for themselves is the strategy with which Stanford's still untoppled In
dians hope to win their third and toughest conference football game.
Threatening rain clouds have been dispelled and the forecast reads

► "fair and warmer" for tomorrow's
annual classic. This means that
Coach Clark Shaughnessy's team
will be able to throw the works at
U.S.C., which now remains one of
the biggest stumbling blocks in the
Cards' path to the Rose Bowl.
With a dry lield under them the
Cards will be able to spring their
quick openers, the deceptive ball
handling, and Frankie Albert's bul
let passes to roll up the yardage.
However, if it possibly rains, the
Reds will be pretty much at tho
mercy of the heavy U.S.C. line and
the mass power of the Trojan back
field.
CHANCES DROP
Shaughnessy's chances of stop
ping completely Troy's famed off
tackle smash took a bad drop when
it was reported earlier in the week
that first-string Jack Warnecke
would be unable to play because of
an injured muscle in his shoulder.
This leaves the Indian coaching
staff with two powerful but rather

inexperienced sophomores to fill in
this vulnerable spot. They are EH
Stamm and Ed McCain whose in
jection into the lineup will leave
Stanford with a sophomore line
from tackle to tackle.
Stamm has been so far this year a
dependable reserve behind War
necke and will probably got the
starting spot come tomorrow after
noon. But McCain has been devel
oping fast at his new position and
is capable of stepping in if things
get tough.
COUNTS ON SOPHS
Again Shaughnessy is counting
| heavily on the performances of a
! couple of sophomore linemen to
carry out their tough assignments.
If these two can live up to the ex
ample set by the other first year
men, Dick Palmer, Chuck Taylor,
Bruno Banducci, and Vic Lindskog,
Stanford fans will not have to worry
about the tackle smashes of Peoples,
Banta & Co.
Evidently Troy's Mickey Ander
son is not as badly crippled as re
ports from the south indicated, for
"Trickey Mickey" has traveled north
: with the U.S.C. squad and has been
I alternating with Bob Peoples at first
j string left halfback.
With Anderson now in the Troy
lineup, Howard Jones has two speed
backs and two power backs. Not
so fast but just as tricky as Ander
son is the right halfback Bob Rob
ertson. For the straight-on plung
ing that is such -an important part
of the Trojan attack there are full
back Jack Banta and Peoples who
is still the first string left half.
Bill Bundy handles the blocking
assignments from the quarterback
spot almost entirely alone for the
S.C. running guards who are sup
posed to leatl the play are exception
ally weak. The right side of Troy's
line, with such hefty veterans as
Ed Dempsey at center, Bpn Sohn at
guard, and Bob DeLauer at tackle,
will be mighty tough.
KRUEGER A COG
Another one of the important cogs
in the U.S.C. offense is their phe
nomenal pass - catching end, AI
Kreuger. 'Antelope Al" has broken
up several games, including one
Rose Bowl contest, with his catch
ing; and as long as the Trojans have
anybody who can throw the ball
down field. Kreuegr will be a threat.
For the first time in two years the
Cards are favored to turn back the
Thundering Herd. On the strength
of their sensational rise to the
heights with four consecutive vic
tories including a 7-6 affair with
powerful Santa Clara and because
of the none too imposing record of
U.S.C. with two ties and two vic
tories, Shaughnessy's Indians are
favored 10-8 over last year's na
tional champs.

To choke as best they can the undeniably powerful running attack of
Coach Howard Jones' invading Trojans while they get some touchdowns
for themselves is the strategy with which Stanford's still untoppled In
dians hope to win their third and toughest conference football game.
Threatening rain clouds have been dispelled and the forecast reads

► "fair and warmer" for tomorrow's
annual classic. This means that
Coach Clark Shaughnessy's team
will be able to throw the works at
U.S.C., which now remains one of
the biggest stumbling blocks in the
Cards' path to the Rose Bowl.
With a dry lield under them the
Cards will be able to spring their
quick openers, the deceptive ball
handling, and Frankie Albert's bul
let passes to roll up the yardage.
However, if it possibly rains, the
Reds will be pretty much at tho
mercy of the heavy U.S.C. line and
the mass power of the Trojan back
field.
CHANCES DROP
Shaughnessy's chances of stop
ping completely Troy's famed off
tackle smash took a bad drop when
it was reported earlier in the week
that first-string Jack Warnecke
would be unable to play because of
an injured muscle in his shoulder.
This leaves the Indian coaching
staff with two powerful but rather

inexperienced sophomores to fill in
this vulnerable spot. They are EH
Stamm and Ed McCain whose in
jection into the lineup will leave
Stanford with a sophomore line
from tackle to tackle.
Stamm has been so far this year a
dependable reserve behind War
necke and will probably got the
starting spot come tomorrow after
noon. But McCain has been devel
oping fast at his new position and
is capable of stepping in if things
get tough.
COUNTS ON SOPHS
Again Shaughnessy is counting
| heavily on the performances of a
! couple of sophomore linemen to
carry out their tough assignments.
If these two can live up to the ex
ample set by the other first year
men, Dick Palmer, Chuck Taylor,
Bruno Banducci, and Vic Lindskog,
Stanford fans will not have to worry
about the tackle smashes of Peoples,
Banta & Co.
Evidently Troy's Mickey Ander
son is not as badly crippled as re
ports from the south indicated, for
"Trickey Mickey" has traveled north
: with the U.S.C. squad and has been
I alternating with Bob Peoples at first
j string left halfback.
With Anderson now in the Troy
lineup, Howard Jones has two speed
backs and two power backs. Not
so fast but just as tricky as Ander
son is the right halfback Bob Rob
ertson. For the straight-on plung
ing that is such -an important part
of the Trojan attack there are full
back Jack Banta and Peoples who
is still the first string left half.
Bill Bundy handles the blocking
assignments from the quarterback
spot almost entirely alone for the
S.C. running guards who are sup
posed to leatl the play are exception
ally weak. The right side of Troy's
line, with such hefty veterans as
Ed Dempsey at center, Bpn Sohn at
guard, and Bob DeLauer at tackle,
will be mighty tough.
KRUEGER A COG
Another one of the important cogs
in the U.S.C. offense is their phe
nomenal pass - catching end, AI
Kreuger. 'Antelope Al" has broken
up several games, including one
Rose Bowl contest, with his catch
ing; and as long as the Trojans have
anybody who can throw the ball
down field. Kreuegr will be a threat.
For the first time in two years the
Cards are favored to turn back the
Thundering Herd. On the strength
of their sensational rise to the
heights with four consecutive vic
tories including a 7-6 affair with
powerful Santa Clara and because
of the none too imposing record of
U.S.C. with two ties and two vic

By CHUCK SMITH

To choke as best they can the undeniably powerful running attack of
Coach Howard Jones' invading Trojans while they get some touchdowns
for themselves is the strategy with which Stanford's still untoppled In
dians hope to win their third and toughest conference football game.
Threatening rain clouds have been dispelled and the forecast reads

► "fair and warmer" for tomorrow's
annual classic. This means that
Coach Clark Shaughnessy's team
will be able to throw the works at
U.S.C., which now remains one of
the biggest stumbling blocks in the
Cards' path to the Rose Bowl.
With a dry lield under them the
Cards will be able to spring their
quick openers, the deceptive ball
handling, and Frankie Albert's bul
let passes to roll up the yardage.
However, if it possibly rains, the
Reds will be pretty much at tho
mercy of the heavy U.S.C. line and
the mass power of the Trojan back
field.
CHANCES DROP
Shaughnessy's chances of stop
ping completely Troy's famed off
tackle smash took a bad drop when
it was reported earlier in the week
that first-string Jack Warnecke
would be unable to play because of
an injured muscle in his shoulder.
This leaves the Indian coaching
staff with two powerful but rather

inexperienced sophomores to fill in
this vulnerable spot. They are EH
Stamm and Ed McCain whose in
jection into the lineup will leave
Stanford with a sophomore line
from tackle to tackle.
Stamm has been so far this year a
dependable reserve behind War
necke and will probably got the
starting spot come tomorrow after
noon. But McCain has been devel
oping fast at his new position and
is capable of stepping in if things
get tough.
COUNTS ON SOPHS
Again Shaughnessy is counting
| heavily on the performances of a
! couple of sophomore linemen to
carry out their tough assignments.
If these two can live up to the ex
ample set by the other first year
men, Dick Palmer, Chuck Taylor,
Bruno Banducci, and Vic Lindskog,
Stanford fans will not have to worry
about the tackle smashes of Peoples,
Banta & Co.
Evidently Troy's Mickey Ander
son is not as badly crippled as re
ports from the south indicated, for
"Trickey Mickey" has traveled north
: with the U.S.C. squad and has been
I alternating with Bob Peoples at first
j string left halfback.
With Anderson now in the Troy
lineup, Howard Jones has two speed
backs and two power backs. Not
so fast but just as tricky as Ander
son is the right halfback Bob Rob
ertson. For the straight-on plung
ing that is such -an important part
of the Trojan attack there are full
back Jack Banta and Peoples who
is still the first string left half.
Bill Bundy handles the blocking
assignments from the quarterback
spot almost entirely alone for the
S.C. running guards who are sup
posed to leatl the play are exception
ally weak. The right side of Troy's
line, with such hefty veterans as
Ed Dempsey at center, Bpn Sohn at
guard, and Bob DeLauer at tackle,
will be mighty tough.
KRUEGER A COG
Another one of the important cogs
in the U.S.C. offense is their phe
nomenal pass - catching end, AI
Kreuger. 'Antelope Al" has broken
up several games, including one
Rose Bowl contest, with his catch
ing; and as long as the Trojans have
anybody who can throw the ball
down field. Kreuegr will be a threat.
For the first time in two years the
Cards are favored to turn back the
Thundering Herd. On the strength
of their sensational rise to the
heights with four consecutive vic
tories including a 7-6 affair with
powerful Santa Clara and because
of the none too imposing record of
U.S.C. with two ties and two vic
tories, Shaughnessy's Indians are
favored 10-8 over last year's na
tional champs.
