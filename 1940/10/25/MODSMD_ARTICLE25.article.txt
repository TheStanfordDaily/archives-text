# Ups and Downs of Fashion Complete 50-year Cycle

### ROSE DOUGLASS 
Fifty years of blouses and skirts*
might sum up the history of fash
ions at Stanford. From the first
Stanford woman to the newest Ru
ble queen, a blouse and skirt of the
latest approved model have been
almost a campus uniform.
But fifty years have brought
amazing changes to the coeds' fa
vorite outfit. The prim Gibson girl
of the 'nineties could scarcely rec
ognize today's sweater and skirt as
a descendant of her costume. But
if is by the process of gradual
change, the external appearance of
lii" Stanford woman has undergone
an evolutionary, not to say revolu
tionary, change.
.VOGUES OF 1897
The smart young thing of 1897
appeared for classes in a business
like tailored ensemble consisting of
shirtwaist with stiff white collar
(oven then college women copied
men's styles), four-in-hand tie, and
exaggerated leg-of-mutton sleeves.
Her skirt, which brushed the dust,
was slightly flared, and drawn into
a liny waist. Man-tailored jackets
and fedora or sailor hats completed
this natty little outfit.
In the early years of the 1900's
Ihe Gibson girl model was aban
doned for the Christy girl, after
that popular illustrator's haughty
beauties. Shirtwaists starched and
pleated had collars even more stiffly
starched, extending up to her very
tars. The result must have felt
something like steel armor, while
the appearance resembled a human
head impaled on a white-washed
stick. The collars were fastened in
back with gold "beauty pins," with
a neat bow-tie in front.
WKDS' NESTS?
Tailored hats were made like
men's fedoras, but, unlike the men's,
were adorned with feathers or half
,i dozen roses. Dressy hats were of

the inverted dish-pan variety, with
anything from a couple of baby
eagles to a small bridal bouquet for
trimming.
By the end of the war years, the
more daring coeds had bobbed their
hair, and abandoned high collars
for daytime. The "vee" neck was
the regulation daytime shape, while
low décolletés were approved for
evening gowns. Skirts now reached
only to the ankle, revealing high
laced boots and pearl grey spats.
MIDDIES WERE TOPS
The middy blouse or mannish
shirt was most in evidence, whether
topping a tailored skirt or roomy
gym bloomers reaching below the
knee. A cameo brroch or gold bar
pin was as much a part of the class
room outfit as today's string of
pearls.
The 'twenties were the years of
the falling waistline and rising skirt,
culminating in 1929's all-iime high
and low. During these years the
Stanford woman turned flapper —
with a Dutch bob, Cupid's bow lips,
and boyish figure, ft was also dur
ing this time that she discovered
the sweater and saddle shoes.
And then the 'thirties brought
another change in skirt length. Fol
lowing the temporary ankleward
drop of the post-depression years,
they became progressively shorter
until 1939's skirts matched those of
1929 in length. The 'thirties also
brought a trend toward naturalness
and comfort with the establishment
of the sweater and skirt as the
campus uniform.
In 1889 Mrs. Stanford transferred
her collection of jewels to the Board
of Trustees to insure the construc
tion of Memorial Church. How
ever, the Church was completed dur
ing Mrs. Stanford's lifetime without
needing to make use of her jewels.

the sweater and saddle shoes.
And then the 'thirties brought
another change in skirt length. Fol
lowing the temporary ankleward
drop of the post-depression years,
they became progressively shorter
until 1939's skirts matched those of
1929 in length. The 'thirties also
brought a trend toward naturalness
and comfort with the establishment
of the sweater and skirt as the

In 1889 Mrs. Stanford transferred
her collection of jewels to the Board

Fifty years of blouses and skirts*
might sum up the history of fash
ions at Stanford. From the first
Stanford woman to the newest Ru
ble queen, a blouse and skirt of the
latest approved model have been
almost a campus uniform.
But fifty years have brought
amazing changes to the coeds' fa
vorite outfit. The prim Gibson girl
of the 'nineties could scarcely rec
ognize today's sweater and skirt as
a descendant of her costume. But
if is by the process of gradual
change, the external appearance of

an evolutionary, not to say revolu
tionary, change.
.VOGUES OF 1897
The smart young thing of 1897
appeared for classes in a business
like tailored ensemble consisting of
shirtwaist with stiff white collar
(oven then college women copied
men's styles), four-in-hand tie, and
exaggerated leg-of-mutton sleeves.
Her skirt, which brushed the dust,
was slightly flared, and drawn into
a liny waist. Man-tailored jackets
and fedora or sailor hats completed
this natty little outfit.
In the early years of the 1900's
Ihe Gibson girl model was aban
doned for the Christy girl, after
that popular illustrator's haughty
beauties. Shirtwaists starched and
pleated had collars even more stiffly
starched, extending up to her very
tars. The result must have felt
something like steel armor, while
the appearance resembled a human
head impaled on a white-washed
stick. The collars were fastened in
back with gold "beauty pins," with
a neat bow-tie in front.
WKDS' NESTS?
Tailored hats were made like
men's fedoras, but, unlike the men's,
were adorned with feathers or half
,i dozen roses. Dressy hats were of

the inverted dish-pan variety, with
anything from a couple of baby
eagles to a small bridal bouquet for
trimming.
By the end of the war years, the
more daring coeds had bobbed their
hair, and abandoned high collars
for daytime. The "vee" neck was
the regulation daytime shape, while
low décolletés were approved for
evening gowns. Skirts now reached
only to the ankle, revealing high
laced boots and pearl grey spats.
MIDDIES WERE TOPS
The middy blouse or mannish
shirt was most in evidence, whether
topping a tailored skirt or roomy
gym bloomers reaching below the
knee. A cameo brroch or gold bar
pin was as much a part of the class
room outfit as today's string of
pearls.
The 'twenties were the years of
the falling waistline and rising skirt,
culminating in 1929's all-iime high
and low. During these years the
Stanford woman turned flapper —
with a Dutch bob, Cupid's bow lips,
and boyish figure, ft was also dur
ing this time that she discovered
the sweater and saddle shoes.
