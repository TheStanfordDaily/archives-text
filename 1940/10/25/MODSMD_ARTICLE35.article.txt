# Frosh Face Tough Troy Yearlings
## Preliminary Game Rated As Toss-up 
### 
Confident, but not cocky, Stan
ford's HMO freshman gridders will
line up to do battle with the Uni
versity of Southern California
Trobabes in the Stanford Stadium
at 12 o'clock tomorrow in a game
that should be the tops in hard
played football among major col
lege freshman elevens. The game
is the preliminary to the Trojan-
Indian clash.
The Trobabes, victors of the Uni
versity of California Cubs last Sat
urday, and the Papooses, unbeaten
in three games this season, probably
represent the best two freshman
football teams in the state of Cali
fornia. Should the Stanford frosh
cop the victory tomorrow, they will
be well on their way to an unde
feated season and a "little four"
championship, for if they can beat
the Trobabes, they ought to be able
to top the Cubs, a team beaten by
the boys from the south.
BETTER PREPARED
From an offensive point of view
the Papoose squad should be better
prepared tomorrow than they have
been for any game so far this sea
son. In addition to the single wing
back formation that his charges have
been running from all season, Coach
Harry Shipkey has added the
Shaughnessy "T" formation to the
frosh attack.
In practice this week Shipkey has
had Bob Mitchell passing from both
the tailback spot on the single wing
formation and the "up" spot on the
"T. ' And if Mitchell passes with
the accuracy he showed in last Sat
urday's game and in practice this
week, the Trobabes are going to
have to hold their secondary back
on defense to protect against those
passes. Which is just what the Pa
pooses are hoping for, because with
that set-up they can give the men
from Troy a very tough time with
their running game.
ALL BACKS CARRY BALL
One of the good things about the
frosh attack this year is that the
opponents can't stop it by merely
sopping one key back; all the backs
carry the ball, and they're all good.
Besides that, two men in each back
field combination throw forward
passes.
Starting for the Papooses will
probably be the following boys:
Jim Ellis and Bill Brubaker at ends.
Jean Lamoure and Darwin Seeley
at. tackles, Bill Joslyn and Kelly
Ross at guards, Loren LaPrade at
center, John Kenward at quarter,
Mitchell and Bob Koch at halves,
and Buck Favcett at full.
For the Trobabes it will prob
ably be Essick and Elliot, ends;
Fuhrman and Lawrence, tackles;
Olds and Pickles, guards; Bianchi,
center; Brewer, quarterback; Bled
soe and Binkley, halfbacks; and
Musick, fullback.

"T. ' And if Mitchell passes with
the accuracy he showed in last Sat
urday's game and in practice this
week, the Trobabes are going to
have to hold their secondary back
on defense to protect against those
passes. Which is just what the Pa
pooses are hoping for, because with
that set-up they can give the men
from Troy a very tough time with
their running game.
ALL BACKS CARRY BALL
One of the good things about the
frosh attack this year is that the
opponents can't stop it by merely
sopping one key back; all the backs
carry the ball, and they're all good.
Besides that, two men in each back
field combination throw forward
passes.
Starting for the Papooses will
probably be the following boys:
Jim Ellis and Bill Brubaker at ends.
Jean Lamoure and Darwin Seeley
at. tackles, Bill Joslyn and Kelly
Ross at guards, Loren LaPrade at
center, John Kenward at quarter,
Mitchell and Bob Koch at halves,
and Buck Favcett at full.
For the Trobabes it will prob
ably be Essick and Elliot, ends;
Fuhrman and Lawrence, tackles;
Olds and Pickles, guards; Bianchi,
center; Brewer, quarterback; Bled
soe and Binkley, halfbacks; and
Musick, fullback.
Confident, but not cocky, Stan
ford's HMO freshman gridders will
line up to do battle with the Uni
versity of Southern California
Trobabes in the Stanford Stadium
at 12 o'clock tomorrow in a game
that should be the tops in hard
played football among major col
lege freshman elevens. The game
is the preliminary to the Trojan-
Indian clash.
The Trobabes, victors of the Uni
versity of California Cubs last Sat
urday, and the Papooses, unbeaten
in three games this season, probably
represent the best two freshman
football teams in the state of Cali
fornia. Should the Stanford frosh
cop the victory tomorrow, they will
be well on their way to an unde
feated season and a "little four"
championship, for if they can beat
the Trobabes, they ought to be able
to top the Cubs, a team beaten by
the boys from the south.
BETTER PREPARED
From an offensive point of view
the Papoose squad should be better
prepared tomorrow than they have
been for any game so far this sea
son. In addition to the single wing
back formation that his charges have
been running from all season, Coach
Harry Shipkey has added the
Shaughnessy "T" formation to the
frosh attack.
In practice this week Shipkey has
had Bob Mitchell passing from both
the tailback spot on the single wing
formation and the "up" spot on the
"T. ' And if Mitchell passes with
