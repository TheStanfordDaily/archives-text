# Soccer Team To Face S.F.
## 
### 
Rain or shine, Stanford's var
sity soccer team is out to make it ;
three straight tomorrow, with a
win over the San Francisco State
College eleven. The game is set j
to start at lOrllW on the local field, j
Coach Maloney was pleased with
the work of the team in last Wed- :
nesday's practice. For the first time |
this year, the forwards and the backs i
were functioning together. Malo- j
ney was especially delighted with i
the work of Louis Arizmendi and
Wilson Clark, center halfback.
ARIZMENDI SHIFTED
Arizmendi was shifted to the cen
ter fullback position and turned in i
such a sparkling performance that
Maloney can't decide whether to
leave him there or put him back to j
his regular fullback spot.
No practice was held yesterday [
because of the muggy condition of
the field. If weather permits there |
will be a final practice today; it
not, Maloney will give a chalk talk. !
Only one injury was suffered this j
week. Co-captain George Dole was
kicked in practice. His leg muscle '
was bruised, but he should be ready j
for the game tomorrow.
