# Stanford Water Polo Team Clashes with Troy Tomorrow
## 
### 
Lifting the curtain of Pacific Coast Conference water polo, Stanford
clashes with a favored Trojan team tomorrow at 10 o'clock in the first of
a two-game series in Encina Pool.
Coming north with practically the same team that split last year's series
with the Cards, Troy looms as the more experienced squad, as Indian

►■Coach Nort Thornton puts into the
water a team with only two return
ing lettermen.
WOLF TO LEAD ATTACK
Paul Wolf, sensational all-around
swimming star, will lead the S.C.
attack, which has already beaten
Compton J.C. in a practice tilt. The
Indians also took the measure of the
Tartars, so on straight dope they
should stand a pretty even chance
of upsetting the touted Trojans.
Last year Southern California
! nabbed second in the conference
j without the services of Lemoine
: Case, who is considered as danger
ous as Wolf. Case is eligible again
this season and, with Wolf, forms
a fast passing combination. Case
plays center-back and Wolf sprint.
S.C. HAS EDGE
Captain Hal Merino will carry the
brunt of the Indian play, with Dave
Notage holding down the speedy
j sprint position.
Thornton's outfit dropped the
j Tartar club by one more goal than
did the Trojans, but more lettermen
j and all-around experience give the
Southerners the edge.
