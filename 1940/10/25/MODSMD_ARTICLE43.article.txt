r pHREE titanics will headline the
nation's gridiron fare tomorrow.
One is the Cornell-Ohio State clash
at Ithaca, anothei i:. the Michigan-
Pennsylvania tilt at Ann Arbor, the
third will take place in the Stanford
Stadium when our undefeated and
untied Indians battle Southern
California.
As far as good football is con
cerned, this game should surpass any !
on the Coast this week. U.S.C., ad
vertised as weaker than last year's
Rose Bowl champs, are nevertheless
a top-ranking eleven.
Stanford, on the other hand, is the
most improved team on the Coast,
if not in the country. Just how far
the balance has shifted will be dem
onstrated tomorrow.
* * *
f LA R K SII A U («lINESSY'S
squad is now definitely on the
spot. Every opponent they meet
from now on will know very well
that they're playing a candidate
for top honors, and will be trying
to gain, prestige for themselves by
whipping this team.
The Farm coaching staff won't
have much trouble firing the team
up for tomororw's tilt. If anything,
they'll have to apply the brakes a
little.
They're not under-rating the Tro
jans at all, the main danger is that
the Inctowns will be pressing so hard
to continue unbeaten and to re
venge the debacle of '39 that they'll
tie up and beat themselves.
* * *
A FACTOR that might, and then
again might not. prove import
ant in tomorrow's game is the con
dition of the turf. The T formation
offense has not yet been tested on a
sloppy track.
In theory, at least, a wet field and
ball would give the Trojans a big
advantage. In practice it may not.
A slippery pigskin would hog
down the Indian air attack, and
might mess up the hall-handling.
A wet field would undoubtedly
slow down the Stanford speed
backs, but it will also slow down
the men chasing them.

! J UCKY LOUIE is taking a few
fliers on the tough, ones this
week-end to make up for the me
diocre returns on last week's selec
tions.
Stanford over U.S.C. — By one
touchdown, rain or shine.
Washington over California —
Sounds like a conference game.
YV.S.C. over Oregon—Has anybody
seen Ames?
Oregon State over U.C.L.A.—Win
with Willkie.
Michigan State over Santa Clara—
Sounds intersectional.
1 Fordham over St. Mary's—Might
be intersectional.
U.S.F. over Creighton—An inter
sectional game. •
Cornell over Ohio Slate—Seems to
he intersectional.
Michigan over Penn—lntersec
tional as all h—l.

Washington over California —
Sounds like a conference game.

seen Ames?

with Willkie.

r pHREE titanics will headline the
nation's gridiron fare tomorrow.
One is the Cornell-Ohio State clash
at Ithaca, anothei i:. the Michigan-
Pennsylvania tilt at Ann Arbor, the
third will take place in the Stanford
Stadium when our undefeated and
untied Indians battle Southern
California.
As far as good football is con
cerned, this game should surpass any !
on the Coast this week. U.S.C., ad
vertised as weaker than last year's
Rose Bowl champs, are nevertheless
a top-ranking eleven.
Stanford, on the other hand, is the
most improved team on the Coast,
if not in the country. Just how far
the balance has shifted will be dem
onstrated tomorrow.

squad is now definitely on the
spot. Every opponent they meet
from now on will know very well
that they're playing a candidate
for top honors, and will be trying
to gain, prestige for themselves by
whipping this team.
The Farm coaching staff won't
have much trouble firing the team
up for tomororw's tilt. If anything,
they'll have to apply the brakes a
little.
They're not under-rating the Tro
jans at all, the main danger is that
the Inctowns will be pressing so hard
to continue unbeaten and to re
venge the debacle of '39 that they'll
tie up and beat themselves.
* * *
A FACTOR that might, and then
again might not. prove import
ant in tomorrow's game is the con
dition of the turf. The T formation
offense has not yet been tested on a
sloppy track.
In theory, at least, a wet field and
ball would give the Trojans a big
advantage. In practice it may not.
A slippery pigskin would hog
down the Indian air attack, and
might mess up the hall-handling.
A wet field would undoubtedly
slow down the Stanford speed
backs, but it will also slow down
the men chasing them.
