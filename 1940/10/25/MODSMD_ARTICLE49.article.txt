# A Native's Return

THREE THOUSAND victory-crazed Stanford
students clambered to their feet in the Pa
vilion last night to pay homage to one of the
finest figures in Stanford history —Glenn Sco
bey "Pop" Warner.
The applause rang to the rafters as the ven
erable, gray-haired old man, long hailed as the
"Silver Fox of the Farm," hobbled with the aid
of his cane to the public address system micro
phone.
Rationally, soberly, the man who was Stan
ford's football coach for the nine-year period
between 1924 and 1932, told the students not
to expect too great things from their new coach.
"In competition as tough as the Pacific Coast
Conference it is almost impossible for a team
to go unbeaten," he said.
The crowd stirred slightly at his statement:
a handful of pajama-clad frosh let out low, good
natured boos.
Clark Shaughnessy's face was emotionless;
perhaps he was a little thankful for what War
ner was saying.
Because old Pop was speaking of ground on
which he had trod. Although, along with Knute
Rockne and Amos Alonzo Stagg, Warner is one
of football's immortal figures, he was forced
to resign as Stanford's coach eight years ago
because the "wolves" were howling for his
scalp.
The man who originated and developed one
of the gridiron sport's basic systems, which has
been named after him, .the man who coached
Jim Thorpe and Ernie Nevers, two of the great
est backs who have ever trod an American grid
iron, resigned because his system was con
sidered antique—incapable of winning football
games.
Although his name will go down in the ath
letic Hall of Fame, "Pop" Warner was given his
walking papers by Stanford. Officially he "re
signed."
Perhaps Warner, and Shaughnessy, were
thinking of this while "Pop" was addressing the
students in an unsteady, measured voice. The
"Silver Fox" knows that the plaudits die when
victory ceases. Shaughnessy undoubtedly
knows it, too, although at present he is riding
on top of the world.
But there was no bitterness in Pop's voice last
night. He had come back to his synthetic Alma
Mater where he spent some of the most pleasant
days of his forty-odd-year coaching career.
And Stanford rose to its feet to welcome him.
