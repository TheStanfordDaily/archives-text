DON'T answer this one . . . "out how would
you like to buy the same textbook three
times per quarter?
Now try this . . . how does the libe feel about
buying the same reference volume three times
a year, then recovering the first two?
The answer is the same. And, so is the prob
lem of replacement when applied to the Farm.
For the student who buys another book it may
mean a five-dollar bill . . . for the students
who replace lost reference books through li
brary-fee money it may mean undergraduate
cash is spent to the tune of S5OO.
It did last year.
The libe spent that sum in 1939-40 for re
placement of books lost during that period.
Student body fees account for an important
part of the Farm's library income.
Pursuing a judicious, albeit optimistic, policy
of waiting for one quarter before spending
money on replacements, the libe eventually
finds replacement is necessary. Unless the
missing volume is recovered before the quar
ter's end the libe spends a large portion of the
student fund in this manner.
When the S5OO worth of books were recov
ered at the end of last year the libe discovered
that most of them had been replaced.
When you've spent your money for a new
text, the return of the old one doesn't salve the
pocket-book either.
With the huge demands placed upon it in
serving the academic needs of students and
faculty, the job of recovering lost books should
not fall upon the shoulders of the libe staff.
Yet, last year through the permission of Stan
ford's living group heads, the staff made almost
all recoveries.
The problem in reality belongs with the indi
vidual living groups.
Through a systematic check at the end of each
quarter, living groups would be able to return
any misplaced volumes before they had been
replaced, and would thus occasion a consider
able saving. Five hundred dollars is hardly
chicken feed.
Unless some sort of living-unit check is un
dertaken, the problem may grow beyond the
capacity of the library staff.

At Harvard University a uniformed man en
ters each room and conducts a fine-tooth-comb
search for lost books. He does not need the
permission of the living group or individual
to do so.
Stanford has been termed the "Harvard of
the West," but no one wants to carry a good
thing too far.â€”W. C.
