column attempts to act as the voice of the
students, and the administration if they have some
thing they wish voiced in print. It is written in the
spirit of "here's the dope; now what do you think?"
But Bull Session does not champion any cause,
whether good, bad, or indifferent.
So when the following cry for some sort of justice
came addressed directly to this column, it was only
natural that it should find its gory way into Bull Ses
sion—sans any additional comment on our part.
Here goes (quoted verbatim):
"Dear Sir: Christmas to most folks means celebrat
ing and rejoicing. To us Encina kitchen employees,
Xmas holidays mean just being out of work. Every
year, exactly a week before Xmas, we get fired, and
hired again on January first.
"Now, the higher salaried employees, such as the
chef, the cooks, head pantryman, etc., get half pay for
holiday, but the others, the dishwashers, the porters,
the unprivileged small salary army, who need the
pay as much if not more, get just nothing.
"Well, not just nothing: very generously our em
ployers allow us to keep our rooms.
"Will you, Mr. Ames, write something in that en
lightening style of yours anent the above. Thanks a
lot.—Dormitory Porter, Encina Commons."

AT now a note concerning Cardinals. This time,
however, it is on the plus side of the argument.
At the request of your students for "more campus
dances," the Cardinals have been going out of their
way to give you what you want. First materialization
of your plea comes tomorrow night after the S.C.
gridiron scuffle when Cardinals is pulling off a dance
in the Women's Gym.
The dance is yours. Don't let Cardinals down. And
incidentally you can tip your hat to the boys and gals
of Cardinals who are throwing you a nifty dance Big
Game night for $3 a throw.
As a result, this year most of you fellows can af
ford to take a woman. Nasty business, dancing alone.

Yesterday afternoon, the Pi Phi's and the Japanese
Club had their pictures taken for the Quad.
* * * *
r J' , HE deans, the Southern Pacific representatives and
the student councils got together and decided upon
a nifty set-up for the student train which will jerk
south to the U.C.L.A. game.
If you want a deep-seated laugh, dig up a copy
of yesterday's Daily and read the front page story
about the plans for this train—in the proper frame of
mind. Your student body* card entitles you to two
armed guards and a large vile of sleeping tablets. The
story reads:
"Each section will have two student council mem
bers in charge, one Southern Pacific representative and
two uniformed policemen."
That's nice that they're going to be uniformed.
Nothing like the honor system.

thing they wish voiced in print. It is written in the
spirit of "here's the dope; now what do you think?"
But Bull Session does not champion any cause,
whether good, bad, or indifferent.
So when the following cry for some sort of justice
came addressed directly to this column, it was only
natural that it should find its gory way into Bull Ses
sion—sans any additional comment on our part.
Here goes (quoted verbatim):
"Dear Sir: Christmas to most folks means celebrat
ing and rejoicing. To us Encina kitchen employees,
Xmas holidays mean just being out of work. Every
year, exactly a week before Xmas, we get fired, and
hired again on January first.
"Now, the higher salaried employees, such as the
chef, the cooks, head pantryman, etc., get half pay for
holiday, but the others, the dishwashers, the porters,
the unprivileged small salary army, who need the
pay as much if not more, get just nothing.
"Well, not just nothing: very generously our em
ployers allow us to keep our rooms.
"Will you, Mr. Ames, write something in that en
lightening style of yours anent the above. Thanks a

AT now a note concerning Cardinals. This time,
however, it is on the plus side of the argument.
At the request of your students for "more campus
dances," the Cardinals have been going out of their
way to give you what you want. First materialization
of your plea comes tomorrow night after the S.C.
gridiron scuffle when Cardinals is pulling off a dance
in the Women's Gym.
The dance is yours. Don't let Cardinals down. And
incidentally you can tip your hat to the boys and gals
of Cardinals who are throwing you a nifty dance Big
Game night for $3 a throw.
As a result, this year most of you fellows can af
ford to take a woman. Nasty business, dancing alone.

Yesterday afternoon, the Pi Phi's and the Japanese
Club had their pictures taken for the Quad.

r J' , HE deans, the Southern Pacific representatives and
the student councils got together and decided upon
a nifty set-up for the student train which will jerk
south to the U.C.L.A. game.
If you want a deep-seated laugh, dig up a copy
of yesterday's Daily and read the front page story
about the plans for this train—in the proper frame of
mind. Your student body* card entitles you to two
armed guards and a large vile of sleeping tablets. The
story reads:
"Each section will have two student council mem
bers in charge, one Southern Pacific representative and
two uniformed policemen."
That's nice that they're going to be uniformed.
Nothing like the honor system.
