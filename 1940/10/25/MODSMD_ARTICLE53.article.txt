# WE EAT GOOD
## 
### 
EDITOR, SIR:
There appeared in the Wednesday "Campus
Opinion" a very stinging letter written by one person
or small group of persons here in Encina about the
supposedly poor meal situation with which the Frosh
men are being troubled.
In reply, the majority of Encina reisdents consider
the opinion of "We Who Are Starving" uncalled-for
and a smear on the reputation of Commons food and
those who eat it. It is felt that, the three meals served
each week - day are sample, clean, wholesome, and
filling. There is a reasonable variety with an attempt to
please everyone.
True, a "queer dish" happens along once in a while,
but the food is superior to restaurant meals for the
price, and no one need go away hungry unless he
chooses to do so. The ability to eat outside the Com
mons for less than $85 a quarter and still get the same
amount requires much exaggeration, besides a small
stomach.
"We Who Are Starving" follows the techniques of
all minorities—making the general from the trivial
specific. Such anonymous opinions are useless. They
shame the majority and incite harmful gossip.
