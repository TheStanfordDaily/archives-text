# REMEMBER, MR. ELDER?

r jpHE EDITOR, SIR:
Perhaps it would be well for Mr. Elder to re
member that there might be other reasons for a co
ed's support of Willkie than his rather dubious sex
appeal.
Even the infinitely superior Rough—if he is not
deaf and blind—should have discovered by this time
that there is another issue at stake much more im
portant than the relative charm of the two candidates
or the respective relations to the moneyed interests
of the land.
You see, Mr. Elder, there is the consideration of the
preservation of democracy in this land. Am I getting
a little over your head? Anyway, for your informa
tion, that happens to be the end toward which all
the energies of the land are directed at this time. I
think perhaps you might understand that the prospect
of Mr. Roosevelt endeavoring at this crucial hour in
our democracy to cast aside a tradition which has
saved us from the parody of our system found in
South America, which has prevented any president,
Republican or Democrat, charming or otherwise, from
becoming so entrenched in the highest office in our
land that he can claim that he is indispensable, is a
very dangerous act.
I do not mean to condemn Mr. Roosevelt as a
would-be dictator, but I do want to point out that all
the arguments for Mr. Roosevelt's third term arc even
more applicable to his fourth and to any other candi
dates third or fourth. As for the matter of a crisis—
considering the state of the world there is likely to
be strife and unrest for a long time to come. I sin-
I cerely doubt whether we need Mr. Roosevelt for the
i duration of the era. We have struggled along before
| with the temporary unfamiliarity of a new President
| with the technique of handling his office. 1 think we
can safely do it still.
