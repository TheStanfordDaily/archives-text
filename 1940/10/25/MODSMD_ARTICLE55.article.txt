# 'Congressman' Hits New Deal In Dry Satire
## 
### 
To the citizen bombarded with
the heavy speeches, fancy slogans
and screaming front-pages of the
present presidential campaign, the
Stanford Players' production of
Leon Pearson's "Mr. Congressman,"
which opens at 8:15 o'clock in the
Memorial Hall Little Theater to
night, comes as a distinct relief.
Mr. Pearson—the brother of Drew
Pearson of "Washington Merry-Go-
Round" fame—combined his inti
mate knowledge of American po
litical affairs with a talent for farce
writing to produce one of the most
amusing political satires of the New
Deal era, and the local presentation
of it is well worth the admission
price.
The shrewd analysis that Mr.
Pearson has made of the conflict
within the Democratic party makes
"Mr. Congressman" more than just
a political farce of the "I'd Rather
Be Right" type. The clash between
the "old style," Garner-Tydings type
of Democrat and the New Deal's
"brain trusters" is shown in an
amusing but shrewd manner, and
Republicans and Democrats alike
may laugh at the antics of Senator
Sam Anders and his cohorts.
Professor Virgil Whitaker of the
English Department gives an ex
cellent interpretation of the harried
Representative Anders, and, with
out any disrespect for the other
players, must inevitably be given
credit for being practically the
"whole show." Outstanding in the
supporting cast are H. B. "Beebs"
Lee, William H. Davis, and B. Q.
Morgan.—Minahan
