# Fall Formals Favor Both Cover-Up', Decollete Models
## Fall Evening Wear Shows Sleek Lines 
### 
Most outstanding trend in for
mal evening wear this season is
"cover-up." Sleeves are long, necks
are high, in both front and back.
However, while "cover-up" is defi
nitf ly with us, the designers have
not forgotten that the object of
lln;ir attention still has a shape. And
if she hasn't, she should have.
Thus the new dresses are a neat
combination of the modest and the
revealing. Line, this year, is all
important. And with the emphasis
on line, froufrou -frou has retired.
Scroll-work in both embroidery and
applique, nail-head studding, bu
ttle beads, and sequins in bright,
rich colors are being used as deco
ration, but —with restraint.
Little jackets, designed specifi
cally to renovate the old black
stand-by, reflect the year's second
most popular fad, i.e., the military.
Fashion has climbed on the war
wagon with a vengeance. Very
broad shoulders with the requisite
amount of gold braid twisting vip
arid down, and around and around,
give the wearer a "you're in the
army" jauntiness; but it's a Lehar-
Viennese operetta army.
••TIIEY" SHOW
As for colors, the a 11-important
"they" are showing brown this
year; it is supposed to replace black
as the basic color. The particular
brown is a warm shade called
"benedictine." Vivid red—each shop
calls it something different, but it's
still the same blinding color—seems
to be most-likely-to-succeed. Mat
ter of fact, it has.
There is no rule concerning skirts.
If you feel like the slinky-lady-spy
type, buy a pencil skirt, but give
up standing like an S-curve. From
Ihe one-length circumference you
can find anything up to a full 15
yards around the base. The sales
iris suggest you restrict your eve
nings to dinner or leaning against
the mantel if you buy the former;
(he swirly ones give you more lee
way to dance.
For purposes of deception, the
>oys and girls have run up several
lumbers with "concealed fullness."
in Ihese, you have your cake and
eat it too, for all the slimness is
there, but it is possible to take a full
step without falling flat on your
face. There is no question about

I
waist-lines. You must have one,
because the formal is going to cling
to it whether it's there or not.
For the woman who honestly j
numbers her shoulders among her !
better features, all hope is not gone, j
It's still to find a decollete ;
dress, and when she finds it, it will !
really be cut low. To pacify the ;
"cover - up" fanatics, however, it j
will be supplied in 99 cases out of I
100 with one of the aforementioned 1
military jackets.
A gown of this type is being j
shown in one of the local shops.
Of egg-shell faille with a deep
heart-shaped decolletage and fitted
midriff, it has 16 gores stitched to
fall in impressed pleats. The mess
jacket almost stops before it starts,
the sleeves are properly padded, and
gold scroll-work tops off the en
semble. This falls in the dream
dress class.

Black tissue taffeta (it rustles even !
more than the garden variety) has
been fashioned into a befo' de wah \
style—off the shoulders with a deep I
yoke of starched white lace studded
with rhinestones. The pinafore has j
turned up here too, in black velvet
with naive white blouses.
Satin, termed "extra dry cham
pagne" in color, has been combined j
wiih coarse black lace to make one :
of the wickeder offerings of the
season. The skirt is huge, and the
lace bodice looks like nothing so
much as the old - fashioned corset
cover with a peplum.
Yards and yards of tulle in tiers
give the required bouffant effect to
some of the more fragile dresses.
Silver combined with blue or pink
gives these their distinction, and
they're calling the huge skirts "To
the Four Winds."

A raised midriff and draped bod
ice give whatever it is that makes a
dress a Dress, to a gold cloth model
with clinging skirt and little sleeves.
The odd buttons, which look lik£
twisted taffy, are called, for jeepers
sake, "molasses button-buttons."

Most outstanding trend in for

As for colors, the a 11-important
"they" are showing brown this
year; it is supposed to replace black
as the basic color. The particular
brown is a warm shade called
"benedictine." Vivid red—each shop
calls it something different, but it's
still the same blinding color—seems
to be most-likely-to-succeed. Mat
ter of fact, it has.
There is no rule concerning skirts.
If you feel like the slinky-lady-spy
type, buy a pencil skirt, but give
up standing like an S-curve. From
Ihe one-length circumference you
can find anything up to a full 15
yards around the base. The sales
iris suggest you restrict your eve
nings to dinner or leaning against
the mantel if you buy the former;

Most outstanding trend in for
mal evening wear this season is
"cover-up." Sleeves are long, necks
are high, in both front and back.
However, while "cover-up" is defi
nitf ly with us, the designers have
not forgotten that the object of
lln;ir attention still has a shape. And
if she hasn't, she should have.
Thus the new dresses are a neat
combination of the modest and the
revealing. Line, this year, is all
important. And with the emphasis
on line, froufrou -frou has retired.
Scroll-work in both embroidery and
applique, nail-head studding, bu
ttle beads, and sequins in bright,
rich colors are being used as deco
ration, but —with restraint.
Little jackets, designed specifi
cally to renovate the old black
stand-by, reflect the year's second
most popular fad, i.e., the military.
Fashion has climbed on the war
wagon with a vengeance. Very
broad shoulders with the requisite
amount of gold braid twisting vip
arid down, and around and around,
give the wearer a "you're in the
army" jauntiness; but it's a Lehar-
Viennese operetta army.

As for colors, the a 11-important
"they" are showing brown this
year; it is supposed to replace black
as the basic color. The particular
brown is a warm shade called
"benedictine." Vivid red—each shop
calls it something different, but it's
still the same blinding color—seems
to be most-likely-to-succeed. Mat
ter of fact, it has.
There is no rule concerning skirts.
If you feel like the slinky-lady-spy
type, buy a pencil skirt, but give
up standing like an S-curve. From
Ihe one-length circumference you
can find anything up to a full 15
yards around the base. The sales
iris suggest you restrict your eve
nings to dinner or leaning against
the mantel if you buy the former;
(he swirly ones give you more lee
way to dance.
For purposes of deception, the
>oys and girls have run up several
lumbers with "concealed fullness."
in Ihese, you have your cake and
eat it too, for all the slimness is
there, but it is possible to take a full
step without falling flat on your
face. There is no question about

I
waist-lines. You must have one,
because the formal is going to cling
to it whether it's there or not.
For the woman who honestly j
numbers her shoulders among her !
better features, all hope is not gone, j
It's still to find a decollete ;
dress, and when she finds it, it will !
really be cut low. To pacify the ;
"cover - up" fanatics, however, it j
will be supplied in 99 cases out of I
100 with one of the aforementioned 1
military jackets.
A gown of this type is being j
shown in one of the local shops.
Of egg-shell faille with a deep
heart-shaped decolletage and fitted
midriff, it has 16 gores stitched to
fall in impressed pleats. The mess
jacket almost stops before it starts,
the sleeves are properly padded, and
gold scroll-work tops off the en
semble. This falls in the dream
dress class.

Black tissue taffeta (it rustles even !
more than the garden variety) has
been fashioned into a befo' de wah \
style—off the shoulders with a deep I
yoke of starched white lace studded
with rhinestones. The pinafore has j
turned up here too, in black velvet
with naive white blouses.
Satin, termed "extra dry cham
pagne" in color, has been combined j
wiih coarse black lace to make one :
of the wickeder offerings of the
season. The skirt is huge, and the
lace bodice looks like nothing so
much as the old - fashioned corset
cover with a peplum.
Yards and yards of tulle in tiers
give the required bouffant effect to
some of the more fragile dresses.
Silver combined with blue or pink
gives these their distinction, and
they're calling the huge skirts "To
the Four Winds."

A raised midriff and draped bod
ice give whatever it is that makes a
dress a Dress, to a gold cloth model
with clinging skirt and little sleeves.
The odd buttons, which look lik£
twisted taffy, are called, for jeepers
sake, "molasses button-buttons."
