## 
### 
Capes, long and full, to swing jauntily from your shoulders or muffle
you up safe from the night air are the new thing for 15) II) dancing nights.
From that soft furry stulY that your teddy bear was made of years ago
to fine camel's hair, anything goes into these luxurious evening wraps.

Some in the know are cheering for <
blanket wool and velvet.
Black, white, rose, warm mid
night blue, or pale sand beigeâ€”
take your choice. They're all there
to suit your own whim.
Or if you don't please to swish in
a cape, what about a classic prin
cess-cut evening coat of scarlet? Or
a demure black velvet with a white
fur collar and a velvet bow tied
under your chin?
If you're very lucky and dad
comes across with the necessary first
aid to your allowance, a dashing fur
jacket is dream material. Sleeves a
little longer than last year and cut
straight instead of swirled, maybe
some extra gathered fullness in the
back.
