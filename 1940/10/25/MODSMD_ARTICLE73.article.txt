# Autumn Fashions Favor Fluffy Furs

New processes of dressing, dye
ing, and cleaning have made the
1940 fursâ€”mouton, guanaco, and
racoon, the most outstanding in
years.
Most glamorized of all the now
furs is racoon. Il has made its
debut as the fur of,the season, and
no longer is it the ' rah rah" coed
coat. Neither is it used in its nat
ural shade, but is dyed a dark brown
to look like mink. This resemblance
is the main cause of its great and
growing popularity.
Next in line is the mouton or
"mutton." It has become especially
fashionable in the last year for cas
ual afternoon and sportswear. A
rather bulky fur ol' medium weight,
it has the luxurious look of Alaskan
seal. Ensembles of coat, hat, and
muff are the most popular in this
lur.
Guanaco, or South American !!: -

practical fur, but is very much in
vogue because of its resemblance
to blue fox. It is in this shade that
it is most popular, though it also
comes in grey or platinum tones.
