# Farm Co-eds Join Swing To Corduroy

### PEGGY BOOTIIE 
By PEGGY BOOTIIE

According to Noah Webster, cor
duroy is a heavy corded or ribbed
cotton fabric woven like velvet; ac
cording to fashion experts, corduroy
is just about tops on the list of fab
ric innovations this season; and ac
cording to Stanford coeds, corduroy
garments are an integral part of
their wardrobes for fall 1940.
The corduroy of today's fashion
rage is a far cry from the much mu
tilated material enclosing the sturdy
limbs of the Stanford Rough. The
weaker sex wears its corduroy
woven in a variety of rib widths
with the new pin stripe weave used
most widely because of its light
weight. No longer is corduroy seen
only in a neutral shade but in bril
liant, eye-catching colors such as
Robin red and Kelly green.
That Farmerettes have taken up
this new fabric is testified to by
Paly stores. While representatives
of all the stores agree that students
were buying clothes of corduroy,
they disagreed on the question, "Is
corduroy, like the automobile, here
to stay?"
It was characterized as just a pop
ular fad of the moment not for the
conservative on one hand, and as a
material so practical that it would
be retained indefinitely on the other.
Stanford purchasers were con
sulted on the corduroy question.
Out of ten girls in a corridor of one
of the living groups, six of them
possessed at least one article of
corduroy.
LACK IS RARE
Rare indeed is the type of garment
which has not been created in cor
duroy. Originally a sport fabric, the
streamlined, light-weight versions
have even invaded the evening dress
domain. A Paly store has been
showing a long dress in corduroy,
as well as a bright red full-length
evening coat with an attached hood.
Hats and bags have also joined the
corduroy parade along with loung
ing pajamas and bathrobes.
For campus wear, dresses and
jumpers of corduroy have been seen
in abundance on the Quad. The
dresses are usually made with the
classic swing skirts and dressmaker
tops. Skirts and vests run a close
second in popularity with many of
the vests effectively combining cor
duroy backs with plaid wool fronts.
Bright red skirts or jumpers with
matching jockey caps have put in
a colorful appearance in the Stan
lord rooting section this year to
make corduroy's coverage of the
campus complete.
That corduroy is a passing fad of
fashion or a permanent addition to
textiles for campus clothes is a
matter of conjecture; that Stanford
coeds are wearing lots of it is now
a matter of record.

LACK IS RARE
Rare indeed is the type of garment
which has not been created in cor
duroy. Originally a sport fabric, the
streamlined, light-weight versions
have even invaded the evening dress
domain. A Paly store has been
showing a long dress in corduroy,
as well as a bright red full-length
evening coat with an attached hood.
Hats and bags have also joined the
corduroy parade along with loung
ing pajamas and bathrobes.
For campus wear, dresses and
jumpers of corduroy have been seen
in abundance on the Quad. The
dresses are usually made with the
classic swing skirts and dressmaker
tops. Skirts and vests run a close
second in popularity with many of
the vests effectively combining cor
duroy backs with plaid wool fronts.
Bright red skirts or jumpers with
matching jockey caps have put in
a colorful appearance in the Stan
lord rooting section this year to
make corduroy's coverage of the
campus complete.
That corduroy is a passing fad of
fashion or a permanent addition to
textiles for campus clothes is a
matter of conjecture; that Stanford
coeds are wearing lots of it is now
a matter of record.

According to Noah Webster, cor
duroy is a heavy corded or ribbed
cotton fabric woven like velvet; ac
cording to fashion experts, corduroy
is just about tops on the list of fab
ric innovations this season; and ac
cording to Stanford coeds, corduroy
garments are an integral part of
their wardrobes for fall 1940.
The corduroy of today's fashion
rage is a far cry from the much mu
tilated material enclosing the sturdy
limbs of the Stanford Rough. The
weaker sex wears its corduroy
woven in a variety of rib widths
with the new pin stripe weave used
most widely because of its light
weight. No longer is corduroy seen
only in a neutral shade but in bril
liant, eye-catching colors such as
Robin red and Kelly green.
That Farmerettes have taken up
this new fabric is testified to by
Paly stores. While representatives
of all the stores agree that students
were buying clothes of corduroy,
they disagreed on the question, "Is
corduroy, like the automobile, here
to stay?"
It was characterized as just a pop
ular fad of the moment not for the
conservative on one hand, and as a
material so practical that it would
be retained indefinitely on the other.
