The clothing of young ladies is a touchy subject. Any slight criticism
of what the girl happens to be wearing brings first of all an unhappy,
upset look. Then the girl usually smiles and says, "Well, I'll go right
home and change it for you." About this time she has decided that you
are a fool, and that she doesn't care much if she ever sees you again.

So the best thing to do is not
talk about ladies' clothes.
But you can't very well not talk
about ladies' clothes in a fashion
edition, so let's talk about ladies'
clothes.
First of all on the matter of silk
stockings. If all the girls have de
cided that they want to wear silk
stockings on the Quad, well that is
all right. But if they are going to
wear them, they ought to at least
get the things on straight.
ABHORS CROOKED SEAMS
Wrinkled silk stockings are about
the worst.
Next comes shoes. Throw away all
wedges and reasonable facsimiles.
Get back to the good old brown and
white shoes, with low heels. These
are the best. Also girls with rather
husky legs shouldn't wear those
mocassins. These make the legs look
broader.
Up higher, the clothing should be
almost exclusively in the form of a
skirt or sweater. These look real
good. The colors should be greens
and browns mostly. Under the
sweater should be something white.
But one thing to remember about
skirts and sweaters. They don't look
too good with rather fat girls. Espe
cially the skirts. They seem to give
a constricting appearance. Also, it
looks bulgy.

And one thing about sweaters.
Stick to the smooth ones. Those
big fluffy ones throw everything out
of proportion.
Hats don't look good at all, except
for those buckets or whatever they
are. Pick brown or red buckets, not
blue.
LIKES CLASSIC SWEATERS
Something that looks pretty good
is those red and white dresses. Espe
cially around here, that color
scheme goes well.
One thing more. Avoid wearing
too many trinkets and things. It just
makes you look like a Christmas
tree. You should try to keep your
clothes simple, the material smooth
and the colors should work together.

LIKES CLASSIC SWEATERS
Something that looks pretty good
is those red and white dresses. Espe
cially around here, that color
scheme goes well.
One thing more. Avoid wearing
too many trinkets and things. It just
makes you look like a Christmas
tree. You should try to keep your
clothes simple, the material smooth
and the colors should work together.

The clothing of young ladies is a touchy subject. Any slight criticism
of what the girl happens to be wearing brings first of all an unhappy,
upset look. Then the girl usually smiles and says, "Well, I'll go right
home and change it for you." About this time she has decided that you
are a fool, and that she doesn't care much if she ever sees you again.

So the best thing to do is not
talk about ladies' clothes.
But you can't very well not talk
about ladies' clothes in a fashion
edition, so let's talk about ladies'
clothes.
First of all on the matter of silk
stockings. If all the girls have de
cided that they want to wear silk
stockings on the Quad, well that is
all right. But if they are going to
wear them, they ought to at least
get the things on straight.
ABHORS CROOKED SEAMS
Wrinkled silk stockings are about
the worst.
Next comes shoes. Throw away all
wedges and reasonable facsimiles.
Get back to the good old brown and
white shoes, with low heels. These
are the best. Also girls with rather
husky legs shouldn't wear those
mocassins. These make the legs look
broader.
Up higher, the clothing should be
almost exclusively in the form of a
skirt or sweater. These look real
good. The colors should be greens
and browns mostly. Under the
sweater should be something white.
But one thing to remember about
skirts and sweaters. They don't look
too good with rather fat girls. Espe
cially the skirts. They seem to give
a constricting appearance. Also, it
looks bulgy.

And one thing about sweaters.
Stick to the smooth ones. Those
big fluffy ones throw everything out
of proportion.
Hats don't look good at all, except
for those buckets or whatever they
are. Pick brown or red buckets, not
blue.
