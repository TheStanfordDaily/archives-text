# College Rooms Tend Toward Feminine Decor
## 
### 
Girls' college rooms are going
feminine. The trend is turning
quickly from the banner - hung,
"rah-rah" room of the supposedly
typical coed, to pastel - colored,
multi-cushioned rooms where our
coed finds peace for studying or
resting.
No longer do photographs and
catchy pictures plaster every avail
able inch of wall-space, nor do
snap-shots of beach-tarzans obscure
every mirror. Instead there are
rarely more than two or three very
special photographs.
BLUE PREDOMINATES
Predominating color in the rooms
at Roble this year is blue —for an
average of three out of every five
rooms either "major" in it, or come
very close. Runners-up are beige,
pink, or green, with an amazing use
of beige as a "back-ground" color.
"Musts" still include the ever
present radio — small, and white
usually—typewriter hidden under
the desk, rug by the bed, lamp on
the desk, and cushions everywhere!
More and more portable phono
graphs are noticed.
G.O.P. INVADES ROBLE
Novelties, dear to every girl's
heart, reflect their owner's person
ality. One room boasts sailboats —
on walls, cushions, and on the bu
reau. One room favors tiny figures
—Dresden - delicate in tone and
gracefulness. One ardent Roble Re
publican has even found time to
collect elephants of all shapes, sizes,
and degrees of squashiness.
Originality means much and price
means little in converting a "cell"
into a boudoir. The dime-store has
proven a gold-mine to resourceful
girls craving useful or ornamental
"nuggets."

The latest timepiece is a tiny
round watch on the hilt of a small
gold dagger.
