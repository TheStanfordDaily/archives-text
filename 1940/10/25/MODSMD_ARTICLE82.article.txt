# Glasses Become Whimsical
## 
### 
"Grandma's specs" are no more.
Glasses this fall are gayer and gid
dier than ever Impish harle
quin frames in bright colors, clear
Zylonite frames, and new - styled
rimless glasses are taking the stage
away from the heavy, dark frames
associated with the old-fashioned
glasses. And the result is glasses
that are more attractive and becom
ing than ever in their history.
Those "pixillated spectacles," har
lequin glasses, with their up-turned
corners are the latest innovation.
They are designed to give the wear
er an elfin look, and are especially
new in bright colorsâ€”blue, red, and
green.

Most popular with students at
present, however, are clear Zylonite
frames. These are becoming, blend
with the complexion, and aren't
conspicuous. Local opticians say
that 95 per cent of the framed glasses
they sell are Zylonite. Zylonite
frames are sturdy and don't break
easily.
Rimless glasses are also gaining
favor.- These are the least conspicu
out glasses. New ones are shaped
to follow the eyebrow line above
and the eye socket below and have
a supporting bar across the top and
behind the lens which makes them
less apt to break than before.
