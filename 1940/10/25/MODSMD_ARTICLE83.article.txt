# Latest Evening Shoes Called 'Spectacular'
## 
### 
The latest evening shoes are spec- '
tacular—that's about the nearest
you can come to describing them en
masse.
Now that wedgies are almost uni
versally accepted, some designer has
popped out with a new heel, called
the cantilever. It looks like a wedge
with a hole scooped out in the mid
dle of the back, and all the authori
ties claim that its foreshortening ef

fect is little short of miraculous.
As if that weren't enough, heels
are being decorated with mosaic
mirrors—really. Add to that shoes
of leopard, gilt thread cobwebs, and
scroll heels, and you have a picture
of the fall fashions in evening shoes
—if you can stand it.
Raccoon coats will appear again
this year in football stadiums.
