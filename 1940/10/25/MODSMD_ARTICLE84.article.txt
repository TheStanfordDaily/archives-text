(Editor's Note: The following article was written for the Daily Fashion
Edition by Betsy Fricke, Dee Gee, '42, who is the local correspondent for
College Bazaar, an alliliate of the popular Harper's.)
On the English corner at ten o'clock and in the Cellar at three o'clock—
you'll see the typical Stanford woman. Ten to one she'll he wearing u
Shetland tweed skirt, a white silk Hcndan shirt ,and either a tweed
jacket, or a baggy sweater, and the inevitable saddle shoes. Ultra-con
servative, she puts her money into imported tweeds and Scotch sweaters.

She has a younger sister, though,
who wears a gay gabardine pina
fore, and this little sister is rapidly
becoming accepted in the best of
families.
For she's new; she's practical;
she's becoming; and she's clever.
Because of the men-folk, and be
cause she really is conservative,
knee-high skirts and stockings are
having a hard time getting in the
group and pi'obably never will.
At the show in Paly or down at
Dinah's afterward, the rough may
not be able to recognize his own
date, for everyone has on a wool
dress, and seven out of ten wear
spectator sports pumps — yet he
wouldn't take her out unless she
looked like all the rest.
If she's baggy and tweedy by day,
by the night lights in the City she's
a different person. Her slim black
dress and accessories are a perfect
background for a stunning piece of
costume jewelry and a clever hat.
She's smooth and sophisticated off
the campus.
You'd never dream that she ever
saw a tweed skirt. Her formals are
bought with malice of forethought to
add glamour, and usually succeed.
Then comes Sunday morning, and
how typical it is of the mad incon
sistency of Stanford clothes. You
see the glamour girl you dated Sat
urday night in jeans and a plaid
shirt, and strangely enough, she
looks wonderful.
This is too rr -so you shake
your head stupidly, and wisely de
cide that there's no sense in wom
en's clothes anyway, so why bother!

background for a stunning piece of
costume jewelry and a clever hat.
She's smooth and sophisticated off
the campus.
You'd never dream that she ever
saw a tweed skirt. Her formals are
bought with malice of forethought to
add glamour, and usually succeed.
Then comes Sunday morning, and
how typical it is of the mad incon
sistency of Stanford clothes. You
see the glamour girl you dated Sat
urday night in jeans and a plaid
shirt, and strangely enough, she
looks wonderful.
This is too rr -so you shake
your head stupidly, and wisely de
cide that there's no sense in wom
en's clothes anyway, so why bother!

On the English corner at ten o'clock and in the Cellar at three o'clock—
you'll see the typical Stanford woman. Ten to one she'll he wearing u
Shetland tweed skirt, a white silk Hcndan shirt ,and either a tweed
jacket, or a baggy sweater, and the inevitable saddle shoes. Ultra-con
servative, she puts her money into imported tweeds and Scotch sweaters.

She has a younger sister, though,
who wears a gay gabardine pina
fore, and this little sister is rapidly
becoming accepted in the best of
families.
For she's new; she's practical;
she's becoming; and she's clever.
Because of the men-folk, and be
cause she really is conservative,
knee-high skirts and stockings are
having a hard time getting in the
group and pi'obably never will.
At the show in Paly or down at
Dinah's afterward, the rough may
not be able to recognize his own
date, for everyone has on a wool
dress, and seven out of ten wear
spectator sports pumps — yet he
wouldn't take her out unless she
looked like all the rest.
If she's baggy and tweedy by day,
by the night lights in the City she's
a different person. Her slim black
dress and accessories are a perfect
background for a stunning piece of
costume jewelry and a clever hat.
