### 
Revlon points the way to beauty
this season with three brand new
colors for the lips and finger tips.
For pastels, particularly, "Pink Gar
tor" is very attractive — best for
blondes and light-skinned brunettes.
Revlon's "Scarlet Slipper" is an
exciting, vivid shade—definitely red.
The glamour shade of this fall is
"Black Mask." It is sort of a com
bination of last year's "Raven Red"
and black. Most glamorous under
bright lights. ... For the winter,
fashion says wear clear colors on
the red side. . . . And, of course,
polish to match.
Pan-Cake make-up is rapidly be
coming a tradition. Max Factor's
shades, 1, 2 and 3 are the most popu
lar. Just a simple little cake of
powder applied with a moist sponge
will give that smooth look in three
minutes. And it stays on all day
or night—or both in a pinch.
The cutest trick of the season in
make-up is Revlon's Cheek Stick.
It's a tube which looks amazingly
like a lip stick, but it isn't. It's a
moist rouge which can also be ap
plied to the lips. Advantage—it
stays on indefinitely through all
kinds of weather—or dancing.
