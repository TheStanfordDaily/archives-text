# Leopard trim Used On Shoes
## Vinylite and Fur Make Footnotes 
### 
New materials have made dress
shoes this year top news in the shoe
field of fashion. Vinylite, the new
plastic material which is transpar
ent and makes every girl a Cinder
ella in glass slippers, is the most im
portant.
Most fascinating feature of Viny
lite is its ability to make the wearer
appear to have no shoes on, or at
least to give the appearance of hav
ing shoes hanging to your foot by a
thread.
Suede, velvet and rhinestone
studding are the most popular com
binations for this new plastic. Also
very smart is to have Vinylite
shoes piped in a bright color to carry
out color accents in a dress, whether
formal or afternoon.
The influence of the transparent
shoe in showing off as much of the
foot as possible has been also seen
in the open instep which is mak
ing strides in shoe popularity this
year. Thin ankle straps are all that
are allowed to hold your shoe on,
and the more instep showing, the
better.
BRONZE KID COMES BACK
Bronze kid is another show ma
terial which has appeared in fa
shionable circles this season. This
leather is making a brilliant come
back, as it has not been used since
World War I days for a shoe leather.
It complements jeweltoned nail pol
ishes especially, and is very effect
ive in setting off furs.
Fur is also being seen on shoes.
Leopard is especially popular now.
Palter DeLiso, who has made such
a splash in the shoe field with his
barefoot styles (and for reasonable
prices too) was the first to come out
with leopard on sandals.
The closed toe is back again, al
though open toes are still good and
will probably be good for many a
season due to their ability to shorten
the foot. Everything speaks for
short vamps, and femininity in styles
are complemented by bows and
other dainty ornaments on pumps.
NEW OPEN INSTEP PUMP
The opera pump, always a good
standby, is really good this year, in
view of the open instep trend. News
is the slightly pointed toe which may
replace the round toe, although that
influence is not yet seen to a great
degree.
Clogs and wedgies still hold out
for evening wear and dressy sport
for afternoon; but except for re
laxation popularity, wedgies' popu
lar comeback of last year seems to
be waning.

Fur is also being seen on shoes.
Leopard is especially popular now.
Palter DeLiso, who has made such
a splash in the shoe field with his
barefoot styles (and for reasonable
prices too) was the first to come out
with leopard on sandals.
The closed toe is back again, al
though open toes are still good and
will probably be good for many a
season due to their ability to shorten
the foot. Everything speaks for
short vamps, and femininity in styles
are complemented by bows and
other dainty ornaments on pumps.
NEW OPEN INSTEP PUMP
The opera pump, always a good
standby, is really good this year, in
view of the open instep trend. News
is the slightly pointed toe which may
replace the round toe, although that
influence is not yet seen to a great
degree.
Clogs and wedgies still hold out
for evening wear and dressy sport
for afternoon; but except for re
laxation popularity, wedgies' popu
lar comeback of last year seems to
be waning.
New materials have made dress
shoes this year top news in the shoe
field of fashion. Vinylite, the new
plastic material which is transpar
ent and makes every girl a Cinder
ella in glass slippers, is the most im
portant.
Most fascinating feature of Viny
lite is its ability to make the wearer
appear to have no shoes on, or at
least to give the appearance of hav
ing shoes hanging to your foot by a
thread.
Suede, velvet and rhinestone
studding are the most popular com
binations for this new plastic. Also
very smart is to have Vinylite
shoes piped in a bright color to carry
out color accents in a dress, whether
formal or afternoon.
The influence of the transparent
shoe in showing off as much of the
foot as possible has been also seen
in the open instep which is mak
ing strides in shoe popularity this
year. Thin ankle straps are all that
are allowed to hold your shoe on,
and the more instep showing, the
better.
BRONZE KID COMES BACK
Bronze kid is another show ma
terial which has appeared in fa
shionable circles this season. This
leather is making a brilliant come
back, as it has not been used since
World War I days for a shoe leather.
It complements jeweltoned nail pol
ishes especially, and is very effect
ive in setting off furs.
