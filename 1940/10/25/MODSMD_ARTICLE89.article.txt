# Varied Colors Now Replace "Basic Black"
## Military Trends, Constant Fabrics Rule Fashion World 
### 
The "good black" dress no longer
rules the fashion world. This is the
latest news as far as date clothes go.
Not that it's been cast aside, nor
even shoved into that far corner of
your closet, no. But hanging right
alongside of your old stand-by, the
"good black," and of equal impor
tance, you'll find, this season, an ar
ray of color dresses that will give
it plenty of competition.
Every color in the rainbow, from
soft warm grey to vivid red, is being
worn where that last year only black
could go. The treasured black velvet
dress, the favorite taffetas or benga
line are still seen, and seen often,
but don't be color blind, indulge in
a little gaudiness. "Fashion" says it's
not only correct, but fun.
A.s for style, there's very little that
is radically different, from what
you've been wearing for the last
year. Designers have been kind this
year to the college girl in allowing
her to dress simply and conserva
tively and still be stylish.
MILITARY SHOULDERS
Shoulders of course continue to
reflect the military rage, but to a
lesser degree in dressy clothes.
Sleeves are all three-quarter length,
or occasionally elbow length. Not a
short sleeve to be seen anywhere.
Skirts remain full and flared, often
with loose flowing impressed pleats.
Important is the newest full skirt
that's straight in back.
Fabrics are fairly constant again
this year. Crepe, velvet, taffeta, light
weight wool, silk, bengaline, vel
veteen, and combinations of some of
them are all being worn and recom
mended. Almost anything goes.
To get down to cases, one smart
Farm girl has been recently seen in
a luscious light weight wool dress of
grey, black and red plaid. The dress
has full, three-quarter length
sleeves, a high square • neck with
black buttons to the waist, and a
wide, three-inch "stop-red" belt.
BLACK AND RED WORN
A Lagunita girl has one of those
dresses you dream about. It's a crepe
dress of brilliant red and black. The
neck is high, with a red yoke and
the sleeves are three-quarter length
and tucked so that they push up very
conveniently.
And just so you don't get the im
pression that all black is passe, a
good-looking black crepe which was
seen recently is decidedly worth not
ing.

neck is high, with a red yoke and
the sleeves are three-quarter length
and tucked so that they push up very
conveniently.
And just so you don't get the im
pression that all black is passe, a
good-looking black crepe which was
seen recently is decidedly worth not
ing.
The "good black" dress no longer
rules the fashion world. This is the
latest news as far as date clothes go.
Not that it's been cast aside, nor
even shoved into that far corner of
your closet, no. But hanging right
alongside of your old stand-by, the
"good black," and of equal impor
tance, you'll find, this season, an ar
ray of color dresses that will give
it plenty of competition.
Every color in the rainbow, from
soft warm grey to vivid red, is being
worn where that last year only black
could go. The treasured black velvet
dress, the favorite taffetas or benga
line are still seen, and seen often,
but don't be color blind, indulge in
a little gaudiness. "Fashion" says it's
not only correct, but fun.
A.s for style, there's very little that
is radically different, from what
you've been wearing for the last
year. Designers have been kind this
year to the college girl in allowing
her to dress simply and conserva
tively and still be stylish.
MILITARY SHOULDERS
Shoulders of course continue to
reflect the military rage, but to a
lesser degree in dressy clothes.
Sleeves are all three-quarter length,
or occasionally elbow length. Not a
short sleeve to be seen anywhere.
Skirts remain full and flared, often
with loose flowing impressed pleats.
Important is the newest full skirt
that's straight in back.
Fabrics are fairly constant again
this year. Crepe, velvet, taffeta, light
weight wool, silk, bengaline, vel
veteen, and combinations of some of
them are all being worn and recom
mended. Almost anything goes.
To get down to cases, one smart
Farm girl has been recently seen in
a luscious light weight wool dress of
grey, black and red plaid. The dress
has full, three-quarter length
sleeves, a high square • neck with
black buttons to the waist, and a
wide, three-inch "stop-red" belt.
BLACK AND RED WORN
A Lagunita girl has one of those
dresses you dream about. It's a crepe
dress of brilliant red and black. The
neck is high, with a red yoke and
the sleeves are three-quarter length
and tucked so that they push up very
conveniently.
