# Stanford Crimson Flashes In Campus Clothes
## Man-Tailored Clothes Boast Scarlet Touch 
### 
For 'on Quad" the Stanford coed
favors the new longer jackets, longer
pearls, long - sleeved shirts, and
short ski i ts.
Popular red is featured mostly in
11 if jackets which are copied after
boys' sport coats. These longer
jackets seen, too, in all brown and
tan shades, are practical for their
''uo with everything" ability.
Boys' styles seem popular in the
sweater line which features the V
neck. These fit well with the tradi
tional white shirts. The ever-popu
lar backwards cardigans are still
worn, but with the longer pearls.
Unusual beads, coral and novelty, in
longer length are worn to brighten
the favorite natural and pink sweat
ers. Many hand-knit sweaters are
seen.
LONG-SLEEVED BLOUSES
Long-sleeved white shirts have
taken the Quad by storm. They
seem to be an indispensable part of
the wardrobe. Square shoulders
give the shirts that "smooth" look.
The few frilly blouses have given
way almost entirely to the strictly
tailored shirts.
Skirts are the same plaid wool,
plain wool, pleated, gored, straight
styles. Only new type seen is the
wrap-around plaid that is pinned
at the side with two giant safety
pins. This adds a novelty touch to
the usual skirt, sweater outfit.
Length is about as it was last year;
if anything, a little shorter.
The knee-length socks popular on
other campuses are seldom seen at
Stanford, which is dedicated to the
cause of Nylon.
NOVELTY SHOES
The moccasin shoes are rapidly
replacing the traditional saddle
shoes. Palomino and wedges are
the novelty shoes seen most and run
close third.
Hair bows seem to have gone out
with summer vacation. Now the
Stanford women seem to like barets
to help control the casual long hair.
They definitely do not favor the,
pompadour style and prefer rather
to have plain and casual long and
short bobs. A revolutionary move
ment is the wearing of jockey hats
on every and all occasions. They
look equally good with the long and
short hair.

longer length are worn to brighten
the favorite natural and pink sweat
ers. Many hand-knit sweaters are
seen.
LONG-SLEEVED BLOUSES
Long-sleeved white shirts have
taken the Quad by storm. They
seem to be an indispensable part of
the wardrobe. Square shoulders
give the shirts that "smooth" look.
The few frilly blouses have given
way almost entirely to the strictly
tailored shirts.
Skirts are the same plaid wool,
plain wool, pleated, gored, straight
styles. Only new type seen is the
wrap-around plaid that is pinned
at the side with two giant safety
pins. This adds a novelty touch to
the usual skirt, sweater outfit.
Length is about as it was last year;
if anything, a little shorter.
The knee-length socks popular on
other campuses are seldom seen at
Stanford, which is dedicated to the
cause of Nylon.
NOVELTY SHOES
The moccasin shoes are rapidly
replacing the traditional saddle
shoes. Palomino and wedges are
the novelty shoes seen most and run
close third.
Hair bows seem to have gone out
with summer vacation. Now the
Stanford women seem to like barets
to help control the casual long hair.
They definitely do not favor the,
pompadour style and prefer rather
to have plain and casual long and
short bobs. A revolutionary move
ment is the wearing of jockey hats
on every and all occasions. They
look equally good with the long and
short hair.
For 'on Quad" the Stanford coed
favors the new longer jackets, longer
pearls, long - sleeved shirts, and
short ski i ts.
Popular red is featured mostly in
11 if jackets which are copied after
boys' sport coats. These longer
jackets seen, too, in all brown and
tan shades, are practical for their
''uo with everything" ability.
Boys' styles seem popular in the
sweater line which features the V
neck. These fit well with the tradi
tional white shirts. The ever-popu
lar backwards cardigans are still
worn, but with the longer pearls.
Unusual beads, coral and novelty, in
longer length are worn to brighten
the favorite natural and pink sweat
ers. Many hand-knit sweaters are
seen.
