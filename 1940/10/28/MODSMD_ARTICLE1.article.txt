If ISTOPJANS writing of the meet
ing between Hitler and Petain
some day may compare it with the
conversations between Hitler and
Hindenburg before the Nazis assum
ed control in Germany early in
1933.
If the comparison goes no fur
ther, it will certainly be pointed out
with due dignity that both the meet
ings between Hitler and Petain and
between Hitler and Hindenburg were
one-sided affairs. Hitler on both oc
casions spoke in demanding terms to
venerable old men who no longer
possessed tlys physical means nor
ihe mental capacity to resist the dy
namic dictates of a younger man.
Again the younger man had his
way: once Hitler was named chan
cellor of Germany; this time he was
named master of France.

I TURING the past week-end, it
has become apparent that Pe
tain has succumbed to Hitler's or
ders to incorporate the French peo
ple in his plans for a New Europe,
but definite details have not yet come
from the Vichy government.
What makes apparent France's po
sition is the unofficial Vichy re
sponse to a note received from the
State Department in Washington
last Saturday.
As rumors of the meeting be
tween Hitler and Petain trickled
into Washington, the Administra
tion took steps to try to bolster
French resistance to Hitler's an
ticipated demands. President
Roosevelt dispatched a note to
Vichy saving that in the event that
France entered further into co
operation with Hitler America
might find it necessary to take
over French possessions in the
Western Hemisphere. This prin
ciple was agreed to by the 21
American nations at the Havana
conference last summer.
France "cannot tolerate criti
cism," was the unoffiical reply by a
spokesman for the Vichy ogvern
ment. He said in addition:
"The cabinet has approved Pe
tain's promise to Hitler and there
can be no other choice but to co
operate fully and pacifically to the
maximum of France's ability."
Whether or not this was the sin
cere attitude of the French people
or whether it came as a necessity in
the face of German military might,
observers in America could only
guess.
* it j»?
r |' , HAT the situation in the Balkans
is far from settled was indicated
again during the week-end as re
ports from both Athens and Rome
told of border clashes between
Greeks and Albanians along the Al
banian-Greek frontier.
The consequences that might re
sult if Italy and Greece were to go
to war are widespread, and Musso
lini himself showed that he was
concerned over the new crisis when
he advanced by one day the annual
celebration of the Fasicst march on
Rome c o that he could attend both
the celebration and an important
meeting with "other dictators" to
day.
Greece has been neutral during
the present war but both Italy and
Germany have warned Greece that
she must halt her alleged aid to
Britain. According to Axis news
papers, the British Mediterranean
fleet has been using Greek ports
for refueling purposes. This is not
a "neutral" act, so the Axis says.
But of even greater significance to
two powers—Russia and Turkey—is
ihe threat that an invasion of Greece
will be to the Dardanelles. At the
present time, both banks of the
straits belong to Turkey, and the
occupation of Greece by Italian
troops would bring the Italian and
Turkish armies face to face.
Turkey has already indicated that
she will defend any attack on the
straits with "2,000,000 bayonets," and
Russia in turn may not tolerate the
presence of Italian troops so close
to this waterway between the Black
Sea and the Mediterranean.
The border incidents reported
along the Albanian frontier are om
inously reminiscent of similar clashes
along other borders during the past
few years.

ihe threat that an invasion of Greece
will be to the Dardanelles. At the

straits belong to Turkey, and the
occupation of Greece by Italian
troops would bring the Italian and
Turkish armies face to face.
Turkey has already indicated that

Russia in turn may not tolerate the

he advanced by one day the annual
celebration of the Fasicst march on
Rome c o that he could attend both
the celebration and an important

Greece has been neutral during
the present war but both Italy and
Germany have warned Greece that
she must halt her alleged aid to
Britain. According to Axis news
papers, the British Mediterranean
fleet has been using Greek ports
for refueling purposes. This is not
a "neutral" act, so the Axis says.
But of even greater significance to
two powers—Russia and Turkey—is
ihe threat that an invasion of Greece
will be to the Dardanelles. At the
present time, both banks of the
straits belong to Turkey, and the
occupation of Greece by Italian
troops would bring the Italian and
Turkish armies face to face.
Turkey has already indicated that
she will defend any attack on the
straits with "2,000,000 bayonets," and
Russia in turn may not tolerate the
presence of Italian troops so close
to this waterway between the Black
Sea and the Mediterranean.
The border incidents reported
along the Albanian frontier are om
inously reminiscent of similar clashes
along other borders during the past
few years.
