### 
Three Stanford fraternities were
burglarized early Sunday morning,
according to Campus Officer Gordy
Davis.
Thf< night officer responded to a
call at 5:30 o'clock from the A.T.O.
hous*, reporting a burglar on the
premises. Apparently the robber was
frightened away by the arrival of
the milkman, before the- night of
ficer arrived. A small amount of
cash was reported lost.
The Chi Psi house was entered
and three watches, as well as some
cash, were stolen. The Phi Kappa
Sigmas also reported several small
losses. A child's overcoat was taken
from a car parked in front of the
Zcte house. However, there was no
vandalism or rowdyism reported
following the S.C. game.
Officer Davis was disappointed
that, despite the warning printed in
Friday's Daily telling students to
lock their rooms, so many robberies
were committed. "I hate to see these
kids lose their possessions. It hurts
me almost as much as it. hurts them,"
he said.
