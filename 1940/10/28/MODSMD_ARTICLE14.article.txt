# RED MACHINE TOPPLES TROY, 21-7
## Brilliant Passing Attack Spills Trojan War Horse From Undefeated Ranks Two Winning Touchdowns Scored In Twenty-five Seconds; Albert's Lightning Aerial Thrusts Find Marks 
### 
They called it a story book finish last Saturday when Stanford's stub
born Indians waited until only a minute and ten seconds were left in the
ball game before trampling the Terrible Trojans into defeat 21-7 with
one planned and one unexpected touchdown.
But not even U.S.C.'s Thundering Herd, unbeaten in 17 previous starts

could deny those stubborn, deadly
Indians who knew all through the
second half that it was their hall
game and who stayed in there pass
ing and plunging until they liad it
won.
It was just that Coach Howard
Jones' juggernauts were able to hold
off until the final minutes before
collapsing and then when they did
fold, when Frankie Albert and
Co. scored two touchdowns in an
eternity of 25 seconds, the walls of
Troy really came tumbling down.
HOUNDED GOAL
For all through that second half
Coach Clark Shaughnessy's war
riors hounded the S.C. goal line,
driving twice within Troy's 20-yard
line only to be frustrated by a pass
interception and a missed field goal
attempt.
Yet when things looked darkest,
when Frankie Albert's field goal at
tempt from the 23-yard line hacl
missed fire and the Trojan giants had
taken over to make two first downs,
a fighting bunch of Cardinals who
refused to give up, who had already
played 57 minutes of bruising foot
ball, and who had, above all, the
cool head and deadly passing arm
of Frankie Albert, came roaring
back 80 yards to take the game that
belonged rightfully to them.
THREE MINUTES TO PLAY
There were a scant three minutes
to play and the Indians were in pos
session on their own 20-yard line,
battling to break an unjust tie that
was being passed off on them by a
fluke pass interference decision,
when they opened a drive just as
historical as the one manipulated by
a bunch of Vowing Stanford Soph
omores seven years ago in Los
Angeles when they too broke a tre
mendous string of U.S.C. victories.
Unpredictable little A1 Cole, who
had burly Trojan linemen crash
ing into each other all afternoon in
order to bring him down, opened
the pay-off drive with a 9-yard
scamper around end. Hugh "Duke"
Gallarneau dove through guard on a
quick opener for a Card first down
on their own 32.
ROBESKY RECOVERS
Albert faded to pass, fumbled,
and alert Ken Robesky, who filled in
for injured Chuck Taylor with bril
liance on defense and offense, re
captured the pigskin. The loss was
seven yards and it looked as though
the Big Red Machine was starting
to sputter.
But undismayed, Albert chased
back to pitch again and burled
straight and true down the middle
to Cole on the Indian 49. Again it
was an attempted pass and this was
almost intercepted by an on rushing
Trojan lineman.
It's pass again and this time Al
bert hit Clemmie Tomrnerlin, who
made the catch on Troy's 25, ham
pered by a cast on his right arm
and a couple of Trojan backs fran
tically clawing at his back.
The only way seemed by air and
this time Albert, sent the pigskin
J into the far corner of the field only j
to have S.C.'s Bob Feoples waiting i
alongside of Freddie Meyer to see !
that no connection was made.
But on the very next play Albert
threw the same pass in the same
direction and this time Meyer made j
a flying, circus catch in the arms
of the s?me Mr. Peoples on the four- J
I yard line.
These Cards couldn't be stopped j
now and Norm Standlee torpedoed
through the U.S.C. forward wall and
! into the end zone for the long- j
:iwaited score. Albert converted and I
j the ball game was won, even
| though the scoring wasn't over yet.
TOUCHDOWN GIFT
On the play from scrimmage I
| after the Indian kick-off, Ray Woods, j
j substitute S.C. back, badly rushed, I
j tossed a desperate, wobbly forward
| directly into the arms of Stanford's
Albert, who, aided by the downfield
blocking of Standlee leisurely jog
ged into the end zone.
Though it was a pure gift, this
last touchdown helped make the
I score a more true picture of the
Cardinal superiority over Troy.
True the Jonesmen had all the pow- j
er they were said to have and then I
some, but that sophomore line of i
Shaughnessy absorbed all Peoples, |
Banta, Robertson, Sohn and Co. had
to offer and refused to allow those
Trojan ground marches go all the
way to the end zone.
QUESTIONABLE DECISION
It took a questionable pass inter
ference decision called against Gal
larneau for shoving Joe Davis to
give Troy 26 yards, the last and
toughest, 26 years, to the Card one
yard line. From there the south- j
erner's powerhousing fullback, Jack
Banta hurdled into the end zone j
and Bob deLauer converted to tie i
the score at 7-7.
Almost forgotten because of the
| suspense and suddenness of the j
last two Indian touchdowns was the :
first Cardinal score. It was an ef
fortless and precise 28-yard pass by
Albert to Pete Kmetovic, who didn't
have to break his stride in the least
as he took the ball and Vvent thfc
remaining 32 yards to the end zone.
MEYER BRILLIANT
Meyer played Ail-American ball
Saturday, cutting down the inter
ference on runs around his end, cov
ering punts with all of his natural i
speed, and making seemingly im- '
possible catches of Albert's passes.
"Bosco" Graff was just as effective \
\ at stopping thrusts around his flank.
Ed Stamm lived up to the reputa
tion set by Stanford's sophomore
linemen, filling in for Jack War
necke End stopping the majority of
those terrific Trojan off-tackle
i smashes. He and the other sopho
j more tackle, Bruno Banducci, had a
j tough time of it during the first half
: but learned a lot and practically
J handcuffed the fleet Robertson and
j smashing Peoples in the last two
I periods.

They called it a story book finish last Saturday when Stanford's stub
born Indians waited until only a minute and ten seconds were left in the
ball game before trampling the Terrible Trojans into defeat 21-7 with
one planned and one unexpected touchdown.
But not even U.S.C.'s Thundering Herd, unbeaten in 17 previous starts

could deny those stubborn, deadly
Indians who knew all through the
second half that it was their hall
game and who stayed in there pass
ing and plunging until they liad it
won.
It was just that Coach Howard
Jones' juggernauts were able to hold
off until the final minutes before
collapsing and then when they did
fold, when Frankie Albert and
Co. scored two touchdowns in an
eternity of 25 seconds, the walls of
Troy really came tumbling down.
HOUNDED GOAL
For all through that second half
Coach Clark Shaughnessy's war
riors hounded the S.C. goal line,
driving twice within Troy's 20-yard
line only to be frustrated by a pass
interception and a missed field goal
attempt.
Yet when things looked darkest,
when Frankie Albert's field goal at
tempt from the 23-yard line hacl
missed fire and the Trojan giants had
taken over to make two first downs,
a fighting bunch of Cardinals who
refused to give up, who had already
played 57 minutes of bruising foot
ball, and who had, above all, the
cool head and deadly passing arm
of Frankie Albert, came roaring
back 80 yards to take the game that
belonged rightfully to them.
THREE MINUTES TO PLAY
There were a scant three minutes
to play and the Indians were in pos
session on their own 20-yard line,
battling to break an unjust tie that
was being passed off on them by a
fluke pass interference decision,
when they opened a drive just as
historical as the one manipulated by
a bunch of Vowing Stanford Soph
omores seven years ago in Los
Angeles when they too broke a tre
mendous string of U.S.C. victories.
Unpredictable little A1 Cole, who
had burly Trojan linemen crash
ing into each other all afternoon in
order to bring him down, opened
the pay-off drive with a 9-yard
scamper around end. Hugh "Duke"
Gallarneau dove through guard on a
quick opener for a Card first down
on their own 32.
ROBESKY RECOVERS
Albert faded to pass, fumbled,
and alert Ken Robesky, who filled in
for injured Chuck Taylor with bril
liance on defense and offense, re
captured the pigskin. The loss was
seven yards and it looked as though
the Big Red Machine was starting
to sputter.
But undismayed, Albert chased
back to pitch again and burled
straight and true down the middle
to Cole on the Indian 49. Again it
was an attempted pass and this was
almost intercepted by an on rushing
Trojan lineman.
It's pass again and this time Al
bert hit Clemmie Tomrnerlin, who
made the catch on Troy's 25, ham
pered by a cast on his right arm
and a couple of Trojan backs fran
tically clawing at his back.
The only way seemed by air and
this time Albert, sent the pigskin
J into the far corner of the field only j
to have S.C.'s Bob Feoples waiting i
alongside of Freddie Meyer to see !
that no connection was made.
But on the very next play Albert
threw the same pass in the same
direction and this time Meyer made j
a flying, circus catch in the arms
of the s?me Mr. Peoples on the four- J
I yard line.
These Cards couldn't be stopped j
now and Norm Standlee torpedoed
through the U.S.C. forward wall and
! into the end zone for the long- j
:iwaited score. Albert converted and I
j the ball game was won, even
| though the scoring wasn't over yet.
TOUCHDOWN GIFT
On the play from scrimmage I
| after the Indian kick-off, Ray Woods, j
j substitute S.C. back, badly rushed, I
j tossed a desperate, wobbly forward
| directly into the arms of Stanford's
Albert, who, aided by the downfield
blocking of Standlee leisurely jog
ged into the end zone.
Though it was a pure gift, this
last touchdown helped make the
I score a more true picture of the
Cardinal superiority over Troy.
True the Jonesmen had all the pow- j
er they were said to have and then I
some, but that sophomore line of i
Shaughnessy absorbed all Peoples, |
Banta, Robertson, Sohn and Co. had
to offer and refused to allow those
Trojan ground marches go all the
way to the end zone.
QUESTIONABLE DECISION
It took a questionable pass inter
ference decision called against Gal
larneau for shoving Joe Davis to
give Troy 26 yards, the last and
toughest, 26 years, to the Card one
yard line. From there the south- j
erner's powerhousing fullback, Jack
Banta hurdled into the end zone j
and Bob deLauer converted to tie i
the score at 7-7.
Almost forgotten because of the
| suspense and suddenness of the j
last two Indian touchdowns was the :
first Cardinal score. It was an ef
fortless and precise 28-yard pass by
Albert to Pete Kmetovic, who didn't
have to break his stride in the least
as he took the ball and Vvent thfc
remaining 32 yards to the end zone.
MEYER BRILLIANT
Meyer played Ail-American ball
Saturday, cutting down the inter
ference on runs around his end, cov
ering punts with all of his natural i
speed, and making seemingly im- '
possible catches of Albert's passes.
"Bosco" Graff was just as effective \
\ at stopping thrusts around his flank.
Ed Stamm lived up to the reputa
tion set by Stanford's sophomore
linemen, filling in for Jack War
necke End stopping the majority of
those terrific Trojan off-tackle
i smashes. He and the other sopho
j more tackle, Bruno Banducci, had a
j tough time of it during the first half
: but learned a lot and practically
J handcuffed the fleet Robertson and
j smashing Peoples in the last two
I periods.

They called it a story book finish last Saturday when Stanford's stub
born Indians waited until only a minute and ten seconds were left in the
ball game before trampling the Terrible Trojans into defeat 21-7 with
one planned and one unexpected touchdown.
But not even U.S.C.'s Thundering Herd, unbeaten in 17 previous starts

could deny those stubborn, deadly
Indians who knew all through the
second half that it was their hall
game and who stayed in there pass
ing and plunging until they liad it
won.
It was just that Coach Howard
Jones' juggernauts were able to hold
off until the final minutes before
collapsing and then when they did
fold, when Frankie Albert and
Co. scored two touchdowns in an
eternity of 25 seconds, the walls of
Troy really came tumbling down.
HOUNDED GOAL
For all through that second half
Coach Clark Shaughnessy's war
riors hounded the S.C. goal line,
driving twice within Troy's 20-yard
line only to be frustrated by a pass
interception and a missed field goal
attempt.
Yet when things looked darkest,
when Frankie Albert's field goal at
tempt from the 23-yard line hacl
missed fire and the Trojan giants had
taken over to make two first downs,
a fighting bunch of Cardinals who
refused to give up, who had already
played 57 minutes of bruising foot
ball, and who had, above all, the
cool head and deadly passing arm
of Frankie Albert, came roaring
back 80 yards to take the game that
belonged rightfully to them.
THREE MINUTES TO PLAY
There were a scant three minutes
to play and the Indians were in pos
session on their own 20-yard line,
battling to break an unjust tie that
was being passed off on them by a
fluke pass interference decision,
when they opened a drive just as
historical as the one manipulated by
a bunch of Vowing Stanford Soph
omores seven years ago in Los
Angeles when they too broke a tre
mendous string of U.S.C. victories.
Unpredictable little A1 Cole, who
had burly Trojan linemen crash
ing into each other all afternoon in
order to bring him down, opened
the pay-off drive with a 9-yard
scamper around end. Hugh "Duke"
Gallarneau dove through guard on a
quick opener for a Card first down
on their own 32.
ROBESKY RECOVERS
Albert faded to pass, fumbled,
and alert Ken Robesky, who filled in
for injured Chuck Taylor with bril
liance on defense and offense, re
captured the pigskin. The loss was
seven yards and it looked as though
the Big Red Machine was starting
to sputter.
But undismayed, Albert chased
back to pitch again and burled
straight and true down the middle
to Cole on the Indian 49. Again it
was an attempted pass and this was
almost intercepted by an on rushing
Trojan lineman.
It's pass again and this time Al
bert hit Clemmie Tomrnerlin, who
made the catch on Troy's 25, ham
pered by a cast on his right arm
and a couple of Trojan backs fran
tically clawing at his back.
The only way seemed by air and
this time Albert, sent the pigskin
J into the far corner of the field only j
to have S.C.'s Bob Feoples waiting i
alongside of Freddie Meyer to see !
that no connection was made.
But on the very next play Albert
threw the same pass in the same
direction and this time Meyer made j
a flying, circus catch in the arms
of the s?me Mr. Peoples on the four- J
I yard line.
These Cards couldn't be stopped j
now and Norm Standlee torpedoed
through the U.S.C. forward wall and
! into the end zone for the long- j
:iwaited score. Albert converted and I
j the ball game was won, even
| though the scoring wasn't over yet.
TOUCHDOWN GIFT
On the play from scrimmage I
| after the Indian kick-off, Ray Woods, j
j substitute S.C. back, badly rushed, I
j tossed a desperate, wobbly forward
| directly into the arms of Stanford's
Albert, who, aided by the downfield
blocking of Standlee leisurely jog
ged into the end zone.
Though it was a pure gift, this
last touchdown helped make the
I score a more true picture of the
Cardinal superiority over Troy.
True the Jonesmen had all the pow- j
er they were said to have and then I
some, but that sophomore line of i
Shaughnessy absorbed all Peoples, |
Banta, Robertson, Sohn and Co. had
to offer and refused to allow those
Trojan ground marches go all the
way to the end zone.
QUESTIONABLE DECISION
It took a questionable pass inter
ference decision called against Gal
larneau for shoving Joe Davis to
give Troy 26 yards, the last and
toughest, 26 years, to the Card one
yard line. From there the south- j
erner's powerhousing fullback, Jack
Banta hurdled into the end zone j
and Bob deLauer converted to tie i
the score at 7-7.
Almost forgotten because of the
| suspense and suddenness of the j
last two Indian touchdowns was the :
first Cardinal score. It was an ef
fortless and precise 28-yard pass by
Albert to Pete Kmetovic, who didn't
have to break his stride in the least
as he took the ball and Vvent thfc
remaining 32 yards to the end zone.
MEYER BRILLIANT
Meyer played Ail-American ball
Saturday, cutting down the inter
ference on runs around his end, cov
ering punts with all of his natural i
speed, and making seemingly im- '
possible catches of Albert's passes.
"Bosco" Graff was just as effective \
\ at stopping thrusts around his flank.
Ed Stamm lived up to the reputa
tion set by Stanford's sophomore
linemen, filling in for Jack War
necke End stopping the majority of
those terrific Trojan off-tackle
i smashes. He and the other sopho
j more tackle, Bruno Banducci, had a
j tough time of it during the first half
: but learned a lot and practically
J handcuffed the fleet Robertson and
j smashing Peoples in the last two
I periods.

They called it a story book finish last Saturday when Stanford's stub
born Indians waited until only a minute and ten seconds were left in the
ball game before trampling the Terrible Trojans into defeat 21-7 with
one planned and one unexpected touchdown.
But not even U.S.C.'s Thundering Herd, unbeaten in 17 previous starts

could deny those stubborn, deadly
Indians who knew all through the
second half that it was their hall
game and who stayed in there pass
ing and plunging until they liad it
won.
It was just that Coach Howard
Jones' juggernauts were able to hold
off until the final minutes before
collapsing and then when they did
fold, when Frankie Albert and
Co. scored two touchdowns in an
eternity of 25 seconds, the walls of
Troy really came tumbling down.
HOUNDED GOAL
For all through that second half
Coach Clark Shaughnessy's war
riors hounded the S.C. goal line,
driving twice within Troy's 20-yard
line only to be frustrated by a pass
interception and a missed field goal
attempt.
Yet when things looked darkest,
when Frankie Albert's field goal at
tempt from the 23-yard line hacl
missed fire and the Trojan giants had
taken over to make two first downs,
a fighting bunch of Cardinals who
refused to give up, who had already
played 57 minutes of bruising foot
ball, and who had, above all, the
cool head and deadly passing arm
of Frankie Albert, came roaring
back 80 yards to take the game that
belonged rightfully to them.
THREE MINUTES TO PLAY
There were a scant three minutes
to play and the Indians were in pos
session on their own 20-yard line,
battling to break an unjust tie that
was being passed off on them by a
fluke pass interference decision,
when they opened a drive just as
historical as the one manipulated by
a bunch of Vowing Stanford Soph
omores seven years ago in Los
Angeles when they too broke a tre
mendous string of U.S.C. victories.
Unpredictable little A1 Cole, who
had burly Trojan linemen crash
ing into each other all afternoon in
order to bring him down, opened
the pay-off drive with a 9-yard
scamper around end. Hugh "Duke"
Gallarneau dove through guard on a
quick opener for a Card first down
on their own 32.
ROBESKY RECOVERS
Albert faded to pass, fumbled,
and alert Ken Robesky, who filled in
for injured Chuck Taylor with bril
liance on defense and offense, re
captured the pigskin. The loss was
seven yards and it looked as though
the Big Red Machine was starting
to sputter.
But undismayed, Albert chased
back to pitch again and burled
straight and true down the middle
to Cole on the Indian 49. Again it
was an attempted pass and this was
almost intercepted by an on rushing
Trojan lineman.
It's pass again and this time Al
bert hit Clemmie Tomrnerlin, who
made the catch on Troy's 25, ham
pered by a cast on his right arm
and a couple of Trojan backs fran
tically clawing at his back.
The only way seemed by air and
this time Albert, sent the pigskin
J into the far corner of the field only j
to have S.C.'s Bob Feoples waiting i
alongside of Freddie Meyer to see !
that no connection was made.
But on the very next play Albert
threw the same pass in the same
direction and this time Meyer made j
a flying, circus catch in the arms
of the s?me Mr. Peoples on the four- J
I yard line.
These Cards couldn't be stopped j
now and Norm Standlee torpedoed
through the U.S.C. forward wall and
! into the end zone for the long- j
:iwaited score. Albert converted and I
j the ball game was won, even
| though the scoring wasn't over yet.
TOUCHDOWN GIFT
On the play from scrimmage I
| after the Indian kick-off, Ray Woods, j
j substitute S.C. back, badly rushed, I
j tossed a desperate, wobbly forward
| directly into the arms of Stanford's
Albert, who, aided by the downfield
blocking of Standlee leisurely jog
ged into the end zone.
Though it was a pure gift, this
last touchdown helped make the
I score a more true picture of the
Cardinal superiority over Troy.
True the Jonesmen had all the pow- j
er they were said to have and then I
some, but that sophomore line of i
Shaughnessy absorbed all Peoples, |
Banta, Robertson, Sohn and Co. had
to offer and refused to allow those
Trojan ground marches go all the
way to the end zone.
QUESTIONABLE DECISION
It took a questionable pass inter
ference decision called against Gal
larneau for shoving Joe Davis to
give Troy 26 yards, the last and
toughest, 26 years, to the Card one
yard line. From there the south- j
erner's powerhousing fullback, Jack
Banta hurdled into the end zone j
and Bob deLauer converted to tie i
the score at 7-7.
Almost forgotten because of the
| suspense and suddenness of the j
last two Indian touchdowns was the :
first Cardinal score. It was an ef
fortless and precise 28-yard pass by
Albert to Pete Kmetovic, who didn't
have to break his stride in the least
as he took the ball and Vvent thfc
remaining 32 yards to the end zone.
MEYER BRILLIANT
Meyer played Ail-American ball
Saturday, cutting down the inter
ference on runs around his end, cov
ering punts with all of his natural i
speed, and making seemingly im- '
possible catches of Albert's passes.
"Bosco" Graff was just as effective \
\ at stopping thrusts around his flank.
Ed Stamm lived up to the reputa
tion set by Stanford's sophomore
linemen, filling in for Jack War
necke End stopping the majority of
those terrific Trojan off-tackle
i smashes. He and the other sopho
j more tackle, Bruno Banducci, had a
j tough time of it during the first half
: but learned a lot and practically
J handcuffed the fleet Robertson and
j smashing Peoples in the last two
I periods.
