# Grid Special Leaves Friday For Uclan Tilt
## 
### 
Friday will mark the beginning of
a gala week-end when the Football
Special leaves Palo Alto station and
heads for the home of the little
Bears.
After five straight victories, which
culminated in the defeat of the
mighty Trojans last Saturday, the
Stanford rooters are in a high state
of excitement and hot for Bruin
blood. U.C.L.A., smarting under
five defeats, and Stanford with eyes
fixed on the Rose Bowl, are two
teams that will give each other
plenty of trouble, and the number of
people that have already bought
their train tickets indicates that this
game will be better than average.
TICKETS ON SALE
Tickets for the special train, which
leaves here at 8:45 o'clock Friday
night and returns at 6:45 o'clock
Monday morning, may be obtained
at the A.S.S.U. office upon presen
tation of your student body card.
They sell for $10 round trip and

11 o'clock Friday night, and 10
o'clock Sunday night, after which
