# Theatrical 'Roadrunners' Arrive for Week's Stand
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
The Roadrunners, the (raveling theater conceived, built, and completely
manned by ex-Stanfordites, are back in town. These streamlined strolling
layers will play host to their first audiences (the Roadrunners' world
premiere was held in Palo Alto on July 12), Tuesday through Saturday
of ihis week.
Curtain will be at H:l!0 o'clock each night in their truck-trailer-tent
theater set up two blocks beyond Middlefield Road on Embarcadero.

a Noel Coward's witty "Private Lives"
will be presented on Tuesday, Wed
nesday, and Saturday nights, with
"Yes, My Darling Daughter" taking
[ over on Thursday and Friday.
As it stands now, the troupe in
cludes J. P. Cahn, Jack Dawson,
George Wood, Virginia Sharpe,
Margaret Wood, Margaret Paulson,
Gene Callnon, Fred Clark, Ed Kerr,
and Hal Kahn. These last two, co
authors of "Is Europe," the hit
Spring Show of a couple of seasons
back, are replacing Harry Muheim
and Tony Cefaratti, who returned
to school after the summer season.
CLIMATE IRKSOME
The weather, according to Cahn,
! has presented the main problems of
I the fall season. The first rain in
j Modesto was passed with flying
I colors, i.e., the tent didn't leak.
; However, the water tended to col
lect in puddles in some spots, ne
cessitating a few sharp whacks from
the inside to get it off.
The cold weather has bothered the
cast more than the audience. "They
1 come all bundled up," Margaret
! Paulson said, "but both of the shows
call for very airy summer attire
for the women. And we nearly
freeze."
PLANS FOR WINTER
Some sort of heating arrangement
is being provided for. It will be
! needed, since the troupe plans to
play on at least till the end of No
vember, and possibly into the first
two weeks in December. They may
stick together during the winter for
rehearsals and improving equip
ment, Cahn said. The thii'd season
i will begin in the south in April
and they will work north with the
weather.
Strangest customer of the season
| was a lady who turned up at the
j box office in Stockton demanding a
! free ticket. It seems that she had
| broken her false teeth during the
I first . act of the previous evening's
; performance. As proof she extracted
1 a mended pair of false teeth and a
! resume of the first half of the first
| act.
"We let her in," commented Cahn.

I the fall season. The first rain in
j Modesto was passed with flying
I colors, i.e., the tent didn't leak.
; However, the water tended to col

The cold weather has bothered the
cast more than the audience. "They
1 come all bundled up," Margaret
! Paulson said, "but both of the shows
call for very airy summer attire
for the women. And we nearly
freeze."
PLANS FOR WINTER
Some sort of heating arrangement
is being provided for. It will be
! needed, since the troupe plans to
play on at least till the end of No
vember, and possibly into the first
two weeks in December. They may
stick together during the winter for
rehearsals and improving equip
ment, Cahn said. The thii'd season
i will begin in the south in April
and they will work north with the
weather.

premiere was held in Palo Alto on July 12), Tuesday through Saturday
of ihis week.
Curtain will be at H:l!0 o'clock each night in their truck-trailer-tent
theater set up two blocks beyond Middlefield Road on Embarcadero.

a Noel Coward's witty "Private Lives"
will be presented on Tuesday, Wed
nesday, and Saturday nights, with
"Yes, My Darling Daughter" taking

As it stands now, the troupe in
cludes J. P. Cahn, Jack Dawson,
George Wood, Virginia Sharpe,
Margaret Wood, Margaret Paulson,
Gene Callnon, Fred Clark, Ed Kerr,
and Hal Kahn. These last two, co
authors of "Is Europe," the hit

and Tony Cefaratti, who returned
to school after the summer season.
