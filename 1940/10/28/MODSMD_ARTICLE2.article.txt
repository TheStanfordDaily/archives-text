### 
BELGRADE, Jugoslavia, Monday, Oct. 28 (UP). —Raoul Rosetti, Greek
Minister here, announced early today that a state of war had existed
between Greece and Italy since 6 a.m.
ATHENS. Monday, Oct. 28 (UP). —Greece early today rejected an
unconditional surrender ultimatum by Italy and ordered general mobili-

/.ation, determined to fight to de- ,
fend her territory.
Athens had an air-raid alarm
at 7 a.m. —one hour after the Ital
ian ultimatum expired.
(Whether this indicated an at
tack or merely a test alert was
not immediately known.)
The Italian blow fell with light
ning rapidity and despite Greek
efforts to patch up frontier inci
dents on the Albanian border al
leged by the Italians.
The Italian minister handed the
ultimatum to Premier Metayas at
3 a.m.. requiring an answer within
three hours. At 5 a.m. the Greek
Cabinet, in extraordinary session,
rejected the Italian demands and
ordered mobilization.
ATHENS, Oct. 27 (UP).—Striv
ing to avert open warfare between
Greece and Italy, Premier John
Metaxas today dispatched a "peace
mission to the Albanian frontier
where Greek troops arc alleged to
have attacked Italian military
posts with rifle fire and grenades.
Greek and Italian army officers
met at the frontier at 4 p.m., an
official communique said, but no
immediate settlement was achieved
and Greek officers asked for an
other conference.
The Greek mission, headed by a
high military official, left Athens
after the Metaxas government in
an official communique flatly de
nied the alleged attacks and im
plied that the fighting was be
tween Italian forces and rebellious
Albanians.
SITUATION CRITICAL
(The Italian radio, describing the
meeting at. the frontier, said that
"the situation still is regarded as
critical" and that the Greek air force
was in "a state of high alarm.")
The Athens government worked
against time in seeking a peaceful
settlement of the new high mark in
Italo - Greek tension as reports
reached here of heavy concentra
tions of Italian armed forces along
the border and of impending Fascist
"reprisal" action.
DICTATORS TO DISCUSS
ALBANIAN DISORDERS
ROME, Monday, Oct. 28 (UP).
—Premier Benito Mussolini and
his Fascist leaders today were re
ported en route to a "gathering
of dictators" as threats of Italian
action against Greece mounted
and official reports told of new
disorders along the Greek-Alba
nian frontier.
There were reports that Mussolini
would meet with Adolf Hitler today
and then confer, perhaps some
where in Nazi - occupied France,
with Generalissimo Francisco Fran
co of Spain and either Marshal Hen
ri Philippe Petain or Vice-Premier
Pierre Laval of France.
