Javanese dancers will perform be
fore the Tuesday Evening Series au

music from native instruments, and
Â« xciting dances will make up a pro
gram representative of the back
ground of their people.
I!' Devi Dja hadn't "dreamed" the
jto up into existence, one would
Mill have to travel 6,000 miles to see
these native dances. It was a "tour,
including Java, made by Anna Pav
lowa some years ago that gave the
spark to Devi Dja's desire to keep
dancing.
Director A. Peidro and Impres
fai io A. Malevitch from Paris helped
her to gather talented but "too old"
temple dancers, 12 years being the
retirement age. With the addition of
men dancers, the troupe started
three years ago a tour that has in
cluded most of Europe and the
United States.
