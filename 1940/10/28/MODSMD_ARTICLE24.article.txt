ABOARD WILLKIE TRAIN EN
ROUTE TO BLOOMINGTON, Ind.,
Oct. 27 (UP). —Wendell L. Willkie
charged today that the New Deal's
housing program "has bogged down' 1
and become "paralyzed by a maze
of red tape."
He promised if elected President
to remedy slum conditions he had
seen during his stamping tour "both
for economic and social reasons."
"Significant steps in the direction
of improved housing and land utili
zation were taken in 1931 by Presi
dent Hoover's conference on home
building and home ownership," he
said. "The New Deal has carried
this movement further by creating a
number of government agencies to
deal with various aspects of the
housing problem.
"It is widely recognized, how
ever, that the New Deal housing
program has bogged down. This has
been due to a lack of frankness on
the part of the New Deal in failing
to admit the real extent of federal
slum cleai'ance subsidies. It has
been due also to faulty administra
tion. Today 13 different uncorre
lated agencies compete with and
even fight each other, to the detri
ment of housing as a whole. The
New Deal system generally is para
lyzed by a maze of red tape."
