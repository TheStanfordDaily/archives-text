# Draft to Let Business Alone
## 
### 
\VASHi\T,TOV, Oct .27 (UP).—
Selective Service Director Clar
ence A. Dykstra tonight assured
employers they need not fear that
their businesses will he disrupted
by the draft.
He explained a liberal occupa
tional deferment policy under which
manpower needs for producing nec
essary materials will be given pref
erence over manpower require
ments for expanding the nation's
armed forces, wherever the two
needs conflict.
"It is a basic principle of selective
service at this stage of the national
defense preparation," Dykstra said,
"that material procurement is para
mount. Therefore, where two re
quirements—military manpower vs.
production — conflict, production
.should have priority."
The statement of policy came as
conscription officials completed
preparations for Tuesday's national
lottery which will establish the or
der in which draft age men will be
classified and considered for mili
tary service.
Classification will be based on
questionnaires that will be sent to
each of the approximately 17,000,000
draft registrants in the order in
which their serial number is drawn
in the lottery. Each man will be
placed in one of four general classi
fications: (1) available, fit for mili
tary service (anyone physically fit
and otherwise unencumbered); (2)
man necessary in his civilian activ
iiy; (3) man with dependents; (3)
man deferred for legal reasons.
