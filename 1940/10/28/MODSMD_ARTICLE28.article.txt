### 
VICHY, Oct. 27 (UP). — Marshall
Henri Philippe Petain may ignore
completely President Roosevelt's
formal warning to France, it was in- I
timated tonight after the govern
ment announced that it "cannot tol
erate criticism" of Petain's new pact
with Adolf Hitler.
The President's notes, warning
that any French military "collabora
tion" with Germany may result in
I U.S. occupation of French territories
in the Western Hemisphere, was de- ;
livered Saturday but has not been 1
answered and may not bv, it was j
j understood.
BRITISH CONCERNED
A personal telegram to Marshal
! Petain from King George VI of
; Britain, promising an ultimate Brit- I
ish victory, also went unpublished
i and without comment in Vichy.
Against this British and United
; States concern over France's entry
j into "full collaboration" with the I
j Axis "Pan-European bloc" a gov
| ernment spokesman made it clear
I today that France has tied her fate
; completely to the Reich.
"The Cabinet has approved Mar-
I shal Petain's promise to Hitler and
there can be no other choice but to
co-operate fully and pacifically to
i the maximum of France's ability,"
I the spokesman said.
Laval, as foreign minister, will j
hold the widest possible powers
when he meets in the new negotia
tions with Germany and Italy, hold
ing the offices of foreign minister,
vice-premier, and director of propa
ganda and control of the press and
motion pictures.
CO-OPERATION SOUGHT
When he goes to Paris tomorrow
Laval will attempt to obtain a "pro
| tocol of co-operation" to replace the
[ existing armistice agreement until a
! permanent peace treaty can be
i drafted.
The Petain government's spokes
man inferred today that Germany is
preparing a powerful political bloc
|of European nations which may
i make an appeal for peace, under
| threat that if the appeal is spurned
j the Axis' "new European order"
! may be installed without waiting for
, the end of the conflict.
The "new order" would be estab
: lished, it was understood here, while
| Italy and Germany are continuing
; their assaults upon the British Em
! pire.

Henri Philippe Petain may ignore
completely President Roosevelt's
formal warning to France, it was in- I
timated tonight after the govern
ment announced that it "cannot tol
erate criticism" of Petain's new pact
with Adolf Hitler.
The President's notes, warning
that any French military "collabora
tion" with Germany may result in
I U.S. occupation of French territories
in the Western Hemisphere, was de- ;
livered Saturday but has not been 1
answered and may not bv, it was j
j understood.
BRITISH CONCERNED
A personal telegram to Marshal
! Petain from King George VI of
; Britain, promising an ultimate Brit- I
ish victory, also went unpublished
i and without comment in Vichy.
Against this British and United
; States concern over France's entry
j into "full collaboration" with the I
j Axis "Pan-European bloc" a gov
| ernment spokesman made it clear
I today that France has tied her fate
; completely to the Reich.
"The Cabinet has approved Mar-
I shal Petain's promise to Hitler and
there can be no other choice but to
co-operate fully and pacifically to
i the maximum of France's ability,"
I the spokesman said.
Laval, as foreign minister, will j
hold the widest possible powers
when he meets in the new negotia
tions with Germany and Italy, hold
ing the offices of foreign minister,
vice-premier, and director of propa
ganda and control of the press and
motion pictures.
CO-OPERATION SOUGHT
When he goes to Paris tomorrow
Laval will attempt to obtain a "pro
| tocol of co-operation" to replace the
[ existing armistice agreement until a
! permanent peace treaty can be
i drafted.
The Petain government's spokes
man inferred today that Germany is
preparing a powerful political bloc
|of European nations which may
i make an appeal for peace, under
| threat that if the appeal is spurned
j the Axis' "new European order"
! may be installed without waiting for
, the end of the conflict.
