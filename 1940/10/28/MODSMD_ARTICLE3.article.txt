PRINCE RUPERT, 8.C., Oct. 27
(UP). â€”Two hundred and seventy
eight passengers from the grounded
steamship Alaska were brought here
tonight aboard the liner North Coast.
The 410-foot passenger-freighter
of the Alaska Steamship Company
smashed at full speed into a flat
shelf of Elliott Island at 12:10 a.m.
Making 15 knots, her bow was car
ried into shoreline trees, slashing a
deep vee through the brush. Elliott
Island is in Pybus Bay, on the south
end of Admiralty Island, about 200
miles northwest of here.
Only sprains and bruises resulted.
A heavy death toll might have been
exacted, passengers said, if the
Alaska had struck a towering cliff
50 feet away on the island's edge.
