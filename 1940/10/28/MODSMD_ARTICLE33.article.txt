## 
### 
Stanford's varsity soccer team
made it three wins and no losses last
Saturday, by downing a stubborn
San Francisco State College eleven,
Battled to a standstill during the
entire first period, the Indian kick
ers suddenly came to life a few min
utes before the half ended. Taking
the ball on their own goal line, the
Cards worked down the sidelines
from where George Dole pushed it
into the middle to Louie Arismendi.
Louie unlimbered a terrific kick to
place the ball in the goal and give
Stanford a 1-0 lead.
FAILS TO SCORE
Stanford came out in the .second
quarter and started running all over
the Staters, but failed to score time
after time. Even the accurate toe of
George Dole couldn't tally, when he
had a free shot from 12 yards out.*
But again late in the period
tilings started popping. Inside left
Joe McHarg of the Indians made a
beautiful head pass to George Dole
out on the wing. Dole relayed it to
Fernando Eleta. who fed Dole for a
shot at the goal and a score.
STATE OX OFFENSE
With the score 2-0 against them,
the Alligators started fighting, push
ing the Stanfords up and down (he
field. Finally Ernie Loustalot hooked
a shot, a few minutes before the
quarter ended, to make the score
2-1 in favor of the redshirts.
7'he final score of the day came
midway in the fourth quarter. George
Dole v/as given another penalty
shot, and this time his trusty toe did
not fail him.
Coach Maloney was satisfied with
the showing of the team, although
several of the boys failed to play
their best ball. He was, however,
enthusiastic in his praise of the two
fullbacks, Dick Harmon and Ned
Pugh. Goalie Jack Burns turned in
hi., usual top-notch performance.
