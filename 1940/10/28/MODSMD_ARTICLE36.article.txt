SEEN IN THE STADIUM
According to the weights listed in
the program, the U.S.C. forward wall
outweighed the Indian line from end
to end only five pounds per man.
Actually it must have been more
than that.
The weights listed Antelope A1
Kruger at 183 pounds. That must be
calculated on his frosh poundage;
maybe they only weigh their foot
ball players once every four years
down in Los Angeles. Perhaps it's
done with mirrors, but the Trojan
end looked all of 200 pounds com
pared to the rest of the Jonesmen.
General opinion in the press box
was that the officials booted one on
that interference penalty. Field
Judge George Hicks saw Gallarneau
"shove" Davis in the end zone; the
consensus upstairs was that Davis,
the S.C. end, was also guilty of play
ing the man instead of the ball.
>i< # *
It wasn't the cleanest game in his
tory. Knees and elbows saw a good
deal of extra-legal action. Particu
larly sordid was the way the Tro
jans laid for Pete Kmetovic.
The Southerners had a peculiar
method of tackling the flashy San
Jose speedster. Instead of trying to
stop him in the usual manner, they
invariably tackled him with a swift
right or left to the jaw.
The Indians got a good prevue of
the kind of defensive line play they'll
face next Saturday down at U.C.L.A.
Southern California's forward wall
is just a shade tougher than the
Bruin line.

If I had any awards to give away
for performances Saturday, they
would go to Albert, Robesky, and
Tomerlin. Enough has been written
about Albert to fill volumes, but Ken
Robesky and Clem Tomerlin were,
to me, the dark horse heroes of the
game.
There were a lot of groans when
Chuck Taylor hobbled off the field
with a sprained ankle, but Robesky
came in and played as sweet a ball
game as any lineman on the field.
On his first play lie knifed through
and downed the Trojan ball carrier
for a four-yard loss.
Tomerlin, with his right hand
swathed in tape, played a beautiful
defensive game at. end and rfiadc a
sensational catch of an Albert pass
on the drive to the winning touch
down.
If Norm Standlee ever bogs down
in his kicking again, Shaughnessy
can put Tomerlin in to take Over the
punting chores. Albert did a very
nice job in that department Satur
day, but Clem, in practicc, is the
best booter on the squad.

down.
If Norm Standlee ever bogs down
in his kicking again, Shaughnessy
can put Tomerlin in to take Over the
punting chores. Albert did a very
nice job in that department Satur
day, but Clem, in practicc, is the
best booter on the squad.
SEEN IN THE STADIUM
According to the weights listed in
the program, the U.S.C. forward wall
outweighed the Indian line from end
to end only five pounds per man.
Actually it must have been more
than that.
The weights listed Antelope A1
Kruger at 183 pounds. That must be
calculated on his frosh poundage;
maybe they only weigh their foot
ball players once every four years
down in Los Angeles. Perhaps it's
done with mirrors, but the Trojan
end looked all of 200 pounds com
pared to the rest of the Jonesmen.
General opinion in the press box
was that the officials booted one on
that interference penalty. Field
Judge George Hicks saw Gallarneau
"shove" Davis in the end zone; the
consensus upstairs was that Davis,
the S.C. end, was also guilty of play
ing the man instead of the ball.
>i< # *
It wasn't the cleanest game in his
tory. Knees and elbows saw a good
deal of extra-legal action. Particu
larly sordid was the way the Tro
jans laid for Pete Kmetovic.
The Southerners had a peculiar
method of tackling the flashy San
Jose speedster. Instead of trying to
stop him in the usual manner, they
invariably tackled him with a swift
right or left to the jaw.
The Indians got a good prevue of
the kind of defensive line play they'll
face next Saturday down at U.C.L.A.
Southern California's forward wall
is just a shade tougher than the
Bruin line.

If I had any awards to give away
for performances Saturday, they
would go to Albert, Robesky, and
Tomerlin. Enough has been written
about Albert to fill volumes, but Ken
Robesky and Clem Tomerlin were,
to me, the dark horse heroes of the
game.
There were a lot of groans when
Chuck Taylor hobbled off the field
with a sprained ankle, but Robesky
came in and played as sweet a ball
game as any lineman on the field.
On his first play lie knifed through
and downed the Trojan ball carrier
for a four-yard loss.
Tomerlin, with his right hand
swathed in tape, played a beautiful
defensive game at. end and rfiadc a
sensational catch of an Albert pass
on the drive to the winning touch
down.
