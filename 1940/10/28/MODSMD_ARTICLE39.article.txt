# Frosh Trounce Troybabes
## Yearling Team Reaps Revenge In 20-12 Win 
### 
It was a red letter day for Stan
ford gridders Saturday. And those
red letters spelled VICTORY in no
uncertain terms.
Chalking up three flashy touch
downs in a second half that was as
cardinal as the first half was ma
roon, Stanford's undefeated fresh
man footballers waxed the U.S.C.
irosh 20-12. The victory preceded the
varsity's shellacking of the Trojans.
The thorough manner in which
the Papoose eleven ran over the
Trobabes marks them as the team
to win the "little big four" cham
pionship, the Cal Frosh being the
only teem that stands in their path.
And the Cubs just did eke out a
j 12-6 win over the Uclan yearlings
! at Berkeley Saturday.
i S C. TALLIES FIRST
Most of the first half was played
| between the 30-yard lines, the only
exception being two Trobabe pene
trations, one fizzling on the Stan
ford 20 and the other accounting for
the first S.C. tally.
With less than 10 seconds to play
in the second quarter. Dave Brewer,
brilliant quarterback for the Tro
babes. pilched a perfect pass to
Doug Essick in the end zone. It was
also Bi'ewer's passing that put the
southern boys in position for the
touchdown play as he tossed twice
j to lan Elliot for a total gain of 22
yards.
Coming back after the rest period,
the Papooses really turned on the
heat, tmd U.S.C. was fighting a los
â–  ing battle from there on in.
TROUPE INTERCEPTS
Stanford received the kickoff,
j punted on fourth down, and S.C.
i took over on their own 41. But Jim
| Troupe, a reserve fullback who
was playing like a regular, inter
cepted Brewer's pass on the Tro-
I babe 49, and the Papooses started to
roll.
I 1 : was like this:
Troupe and Joe Mardesich each
gain a yard on reverses from Frank
j Forbes from the "T" formation, and '
Forbes passes to Troupe for seven !
to the S.C. 40. Troupe drives through j
guard for a first down on the en- I
| emy 36; Mardesich skirts the de- J
fensive right end for 12 yards and j
[ another first down.
FORBES SHINES
Dodging nicely, Forbes tours the ;
, Trobabe left flank and goes to the
1 15-yard line, from which point
! Troupe picks up another first down
| on a smash at the line. Forbes again j
j gives an exhibition of fancy step
i ping as he cuts back on an ofT
i tackle slant for nine yards.
Then it's Trrtupe at center for one, ;
Forbes at right tackle for one lost,
and Troupe at guard for two. From
i that point Forbes takes over on the ,
| cut-back inside the Trobabe left end
for Stanford's first tally. Jim Ellis
kicked the extra point. Score: Pap- ;
ooses 7, Trobabes 6.
TACKLE MAKES SCORE
It is very seldom that a lineman
j has a chance to win a bit of glory
j on offense, but that chance came to
Tackle Darwin Seeley and he didn't
muff it. Intercepting Quarterback
j Baker's pass on his own 35-yard
i line. Seeley, aided by several key
i blocks, rolled down the sidelines to
a touchdown. Ellis kicked the extra
noint to leave the Papooses on the
I long end of a 14-6 score. The kick
j marked Ellis' tenth successful con
version in 11 attempts.
And it looked as if Ellis' educated
toe might be the margin of victory
j for Stanford when Bob Musick,
brother of the former Trojan grid
great, passed to Essick in the end
zone for the second S.C. tally. For
the score, after Musick's kick failed
; to garner the point after touchdown,
1 was Papooses 14, Trobabes 12.
GAME ON ICE
The Stanford Frosh really put the
j game on ice. however, when, after
i Loren LaPrade intercepted Musick's
pass on the S.C. 38, Jlight Halfback
i j Bob Koch broke off tackle and
| streaked down the sidelines for 38
[ yards and a touchdown. Ellis kicked
i I wide on the conversion attempt.
