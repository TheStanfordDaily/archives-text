THERE'S something dramatic about that title
"the rags to riches boys." The press coined
it, and the team it described immediately caught
the imagination of the nation's football audience.
The sudden, spectacular climb from the Coast
Conference cellar to its number-one spot has
earned the Cardinal machine the admiration of
even the most casual grandstand guarterback.
The people love it. They like this yarn of the
Indian varsity, swamped by defeat after defeat
in 1939, staging a magnificent come-back. And
they like the story of Coach Clark Shaughnessy,
who gave up the security of a life-time job at
Chicago coaching "intramurals" for a five-year
contract at Stanford.
As evidenced by the crowd of 60,000 that
jammed the Stadium Saturday afternoon, they
like this new brand of football that has revo
lutionized Coast competition.
Football America likes the Stanford team and
its coach—because Coach Clark Shaughnessy
and his Indian aggregation "have it." Sepa
rately and collectively they "have it." Never
discouraged, they have the drive and stamina
to come back, time after time, until they've iced
away a victory. They have the drive to hammer
at an opponent after he has gained a lucky
break touchdown, to strike again and again after
missing by a few short yards.
Their demonstration Saturday in downing a
team that was undefeated since November,
1938, proved that they "have it."
Yes, the amazing "success story" of the Stan
ford men and their coach has captured public
imagination. The fact that it has captured, too,
the support of every Farm student was told
eloguently and loudly in Saturday's rooting
section.
There's one general topic of conversation this
week—and it's football. Stanford men and
women may be distinguished, too, by one fea
ture —a slight streak of insanity that is charac
terized by freguent assertions that "Shaugh
nessy and the Indians are unbeatable." Maybe
it's not insanity. At any rate it's a new type of
enthusiasm that is rocking the Farm to its roots.
And it's an enthusiasm that staid Stanford hasn't
seen since the days of the Vowing Sophs.
Whatever it is, it's sparking autumn guarter
into one of the liveliest times that even old resi
dents can remember. The crowd at the S.C.
Game Dance cracked all unofficial records. Res
ervations on the special trains that will trek
south to the Bruin lair are skyrocketing. Bids
for the Big Game Dance have dropped in price
and the affair has, in turn, increased in guality.
It should be the official gathering-place of the
Farm after the Berkeley fracas.
There's no guestion about the effect of a
winning football team. Skipping along to a
victory-tune, the Stanford pace is longer, faster,
and more definite.
