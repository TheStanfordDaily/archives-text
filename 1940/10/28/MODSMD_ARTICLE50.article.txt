WHAT! YOU CAN'T SHOE A HORSE?
ALL love Stanford. You all think it is the best
university you possibly could have attended, and
if somebody should offer you an opportunity to trans
fer someplace else, you would probably tell him to
go "chase it" around the block.
College life such as we find at Stanford means both
a great deal of work and, secondarily, a great deal of
that stuff which comes under the general classification
of "FUN." Or perhaps the fun comes first, depending
upon who you are. And in return for that work, hard
work—and $130 tuition a quarter—you are obtaining
something which you will find neatly pigeon-holed
under ''education."
You're getting educated. But what exactly does that
mean you are getting? Your answer will probably be
a reflection of your point of view.

A N extremely capable history instructor here at
Stanford has said, frequently and fervently, "Don't
pack each quarter with technical courses such as forg
ing, and newspaper make-up, and mechanical draw
ing. Please don't.
That doesn't constitute an education, which you
came seeking at Stanford. You should take more
broadening courses such as histories, languages, and
English.
"If you want or need such courses as forging in
accomplishing your life's work, why don't you take
them in a trade school after you get out of Stanford?
You can take those courses anywhere, but you can't
just pick up courses like you get here at Stanford."
His is the academic definition of education. And
it holds water, too. He is sincere and he is sensible.
But in certain respects this definition does not reach
beyond the bounds of the Farm.
* * Hi #
It may sound like something out of a recent novel,
but nevertheless, unquestionably, our modern college
education must reach beyond this academic definition.
Today college must dip into the technical in order to
prepare you and the next guy or gal for the "cruel,
cruel world outside these walls." Since many find it
financially difficult enough to work their way through
college, the additional expense of acquiring needed
technical knowledge in trade schools is beyond the
means of just as many. Yet we must have this technical
knowledge.
Proof of this comes from a letter written to the
journalism department by the editor of a California
newspaper. He recently "gave the sack" to a Stanford
graduate—because that graduate couldn't type fast
enough.
This editor writes, "It's like teaching a man to be
a ditch digger without insisting he be able to use a
pick and shovel. If they (the students) only knew it,
next to English and arithmetic, there is probably
nothing they can learn in school that will be of more
lasting use to them than the ability to run a typewriter,
no matter how they later eaiTi a livelihood."
That comes from a man who knows. He is just
one of the many who boost the perfection of certain
technical abilities as a part of our modern education.
"Education" is taking a turn.
