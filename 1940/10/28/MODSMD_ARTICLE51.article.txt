r J T HE EDITOR, SIR:
I heard a story
The other day
About a check-up
On student body cards
And as a student
Who has attended
Four different colleges
It seems to me
That the kind of people
Who borrow student body cards
Are the kind
Who wouldn't go at all
Unless they borrowed cards
And although I have never
Lent my card
Or borrowed one for someone else
I don't see why
An unused card
Cannot be transferred
Like a theater ticket
Or an opera box
I thank you.
