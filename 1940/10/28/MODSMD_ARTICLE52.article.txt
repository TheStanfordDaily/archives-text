r EDITOR, SIR:
There has been increasing sentiment around En
cina for a naval R.O.T.C. unit. Many of the men,
cither from aversion for army life or from family tradi
tion, have been averse to joining the army R.O.T.C.
and yet are eager to serve in the navy.
The navy has R.O.T.C. courses in other big uni
versities on the Coast, such as Cal and U.C.L.A. It
seems strange that Stanford, the leading western uni
versity, should lack this most desirable, and in these
times necessary, course.
Naval officials have expressed a willingness to ad
minister this course and await only the opportunity to
step in.
With the West Coast the center of the navy's activ
ity, it becomes increasingly apparent that more con
centrations of men for the ships will be out here in
Ihe next few months. Why, then, shouldn't their offi
cers be men from this university rather than from Cal
or some eastern college?
The army R.O.T.C. has proved a success. Is there
any reason why a similar unit under the navy would
not succeed?
