# SIGN LANGUAGE
## 
### 
r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
After reading Mr. Ames' column last week in
wiehh he advocated placing signs on the trees in the
parking adjacent to the Stanford stadium I felt much
relieved. I was happy to hear that our worries would
be over.
It was swell last week-end. Along with 60.000-odd
other spectators I parked my jalope amidst the trees.
I looked all over the place. I looked up in the trees
for a sign of some sort. I didn't even find Mr. Ames
there. I gave up and went to the game.
After listening to the announcer, who gave his usual
little speech about safe driving on the way home, I
went back to my car. But it wasn't that easy. I hunted
and hunted. Then I hunted and hunted. Even the
tree formations that I had memorized didn't do any
good. So I hunted and hunted.
Finally I found my car. But only through a system
which I worked out all for myself. I just waited until
everyone had left. Even then it was so dark I had
to light matches to find my way. But I found it.
By that time I wasn't in any mood to think about
safe driving on the way home.
Let's bring back the axe so we can cut down those
trees. Or at least blaze a trail through them.
In hopes.
One Who Believes in Signs
