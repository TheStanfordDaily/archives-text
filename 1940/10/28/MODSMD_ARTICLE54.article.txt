# 'Jawn' Barrymore Seen At His Undramatic Best
## 
### 
"THE GREAT PROFILE" with John Barrymore, Mary Beth Hughes, and
Gregory RatolT, currently playing at the Varsity Theater
If you can picture a member of the great theatrical family of Barry
mores engaging in such un-theatrical scenes as careening down a stage
in a wheel chair and crashing itno the orchestra or as dressed in long
white tights and pretending to he an acrobat, you can get some fair idea
of the clowning that goes on in A
"The Great Profile."

Barrymore is first seen as a slight
ly mildewed exponent of Shake
speare, temporarily "at liberty."
When a play turns up with a back
er, everything seems, fine.
BACK TO THE BOTTLE
Upon investigation of the play,
Barrymore is forced to take recourse
to his ever-present bottle to give
himself courage to go on. Making a
dramatic entrance in a rather lop
sided condition, he knocks most of
the scenery over but draws laves
from the critics.
Meanwhile the little authoress of
the play, who had hoped that her
play would carry a great message,
sets out to reform the old repro
bate; whereupon he swears off ev
erything excepting hot milk.
TO THE BOTTLE AGAIN
The show of course loses money,
and the only hope is to get "Jawn"
back in his usual condition. Barry
more's wife saves the situation by
planing in from Reno and staging
a magnificent free-for-all in his
dressing room, whereupon he de
cides that she is still the most rav
ishing of all his wives and promptly
| drops his hot milk pledge.
Barrymore screams, howls, and
tears his hair, and in short does
everything but recite Shakespeare.
At the rate he tears through this
, picture one wonders how much
longer he can stand the pace; so by
I all means don't fail to see this clown
! acting in his autobiography. â€”
