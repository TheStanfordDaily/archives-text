# Junior Excom To Stop 'Pork'
## 
### 
Following the precedent set last
year by Junior Class President
Sherman MellinkofT, Class of '42
president, Jim Haugh announced
recently he would form a junior
class ex committee.
This committee will be formed of
one representative from each house,
eating club, and proportionate rep
resentation from the larger dormi
tory units.
From this group will be elected a
council of four members to work
with the class officers and to ap
prove all selections for all commit
tee jobs.
Haugh said, in formulating the
plan, that he believed the power to
appoint committee "plums" should
be taken from the hands of one or
two class officers and that the rest
of the class should have some say
as to who should handle class ac
tivities.
The ex committee will be formed
as soon as all living groups can
elect representatives. This com
mittee will meet immediately to
pick the members for the board. It
will also hold meetings before all
important junior class acivities,
such as the Junior Prom, Water
Carnival, and other major activities.
"We feel that this is a step for
ward in keeping with the efforts of
the Class of '42 to foster democratic
spirit in class relations, following
the class caucus last spring to take
nomination of officers out of the
hands of the materialistic row cau
cuses," said Hauph yesterday.
