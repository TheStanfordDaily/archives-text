|>RITONS threatened with an in
vasion of their country prob- j
ably will be slow to realize that j
successful resistance at home and an
effective counter-blockade of the
continent will not necessarily mean
victory.
Thus far the German attack on
the British Isles has not approxi
mated an invasion, but the Axis is
making headway on other fronts
that may be of sufficient conse
quence to permit abandonment of i
invasion plans. The Axis' latest
drives into the Balkans may so alter
the picture as to make Germany and
the continent blockade-proof.
When Germany went into Ruma
nia she gained more than access to
Rumanian oil sources. Occupation
of that country greatly facilitated
transportation of oil from Russian
ports on the Black Sea.
For some time Germany and
Russia have had a pact which pro
vides for the importation into
Germany of considerable quanti
ties of Russian oil. but the existing
overland transportation facilities
have not been adequate for Ger
many to receive shipment of any
great part of the oil promised by
the Russian pact.
But. now Germany has taken over
control of the Danube and now tank
ers may fill at Russian ports on the
Black Sea and ply the Danube with
out entering foreign territory on
their way to the industrial centers
of the greater Reich. There now
exists the means of supplying in
dustrial Europe with the war com
modity she lacks but needs so des
perately; and in the Black Sea and
on the Danube there can be no ef
fective molestation by the British.

JREPORT of Italy's attack on
Greece adds strength to the be
lief that the Axis will try to make
a reality the Berlin-Bagdad thor
oughfare to the oil fields of the Near
East, for Germany can be expected
to strike through Bulgaria from the
north to encircle Greece. Turkey
then would stand alone to block the
Berlin to Bagdad plan.
But such speculation assumes that
Russia has assured the Axis that it
will not intervene even if the Dar
danelles are taken from the Turks.
Such a stand on the part of Russia
would indicate a complete about
face on its traditional attitude
toward the straits problem, but Rus
sia perhaps no longer considers an
outlet to the Mediterranean a vital
issue—or at least an issue over
which to risk conflict with the Axis.
Russia by her occupation of the
three Baltic countries during the
past year has acquired an outlet
to the outside world. Germany
may have satisfied Russia's need
for world trade in the recent pact,
and Russia may no longer need to
look for other markets.
Germany needs the surplus food
stuffs of Russia and her oil. Russia
needs Germany's machinery and
other industrial products and may
abandon Turkey and any defense of
the straits for greater trade with
Germany.

| T may be the amount of aid that
Britain can bring to Greece dur
ing the first days of the Italian at
tack that will influence most Tur
key's decision—either to stand by
Greece and Britain or succumb to
the anticipated Axis demands.
Yesterday dispatches both from
Belgrade in Yugoslavia and from
Athens indicated that the conquest
of Greece will not be an easy one
for the Italians. Terrain will aid the
Greeks in defending their country
along the Albanian border and un
verified reports suggest that the
British fleet will attempt to prevent
the Italians from seizing any im
portant Greek island or harbor. The
tide of battle during these first days
is being watched intently in An
kara, capital of Turkey.
