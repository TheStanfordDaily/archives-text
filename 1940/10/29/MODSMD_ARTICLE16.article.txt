### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 28 (UP). —The draft-age men of America look to
the luck of the draw tomorrow.
It's draft lottery day—4he day of the biggest and most serious game of
chance in the nation's peacetime history.
From a 10-gallon goldfish howl will he drawn little sky-blue capsules,

each containing a number that
determine the order in which the
17,000,000 men who registered Oct.
16 for the draft will be classified and
considered for a year of military
service.
STARTS AT NOON
Starting promptly at noon, the
capsules will be drawn one at a
time. President Roosevelt will
touch off the historic ceremony with
a brief speech. Then, Secretary of
War Henry L. Stimson will step to
the platform of the government au
ditorium, dip his hand into the bowl,
and pull out a pellet.
A moment later, the first number
drawn will be flashed throughout
the land.
Secretary of the Treasury Henry
Morgenthau, Jr., Attorney General
Robert H. Jackson, Navy Secretary
Frank Knox and other government
officials will follow Stimson in that
order in the drawing. The task then
will be turned over to a corps of
volunteers who will draw until the
last of the capsules is removed —
j probably in the early hours Wed-
I nesday morning.
| HOW IT WILL WORK
Briefly, here's how the lottery will
work:
There will be a total of 8,500 cap
sules in the bowl. Each will con
tain a number ranging from No. 1
to No. 8,500. These cover the high
est registration number listed by any
of one local draft board, plus some
700 extra.
Assuming that numbers are
drawn in this order: 3034, 5, 5100,
215, etc. Then, 3034 becomes order
No. 1 as drawn in the national lot
tery. This means that men holding
registration serial number 3034 will
be the first to receive question
naires which will determine their
classification. If he is Class 1A
"available, fit for general military
service," he will be the first called
to the colors. Men placed in Class
1A will be those physically fit, with
out essential occupations, and with
out dependents.
DKTERMINES SEQUENCE
Men holding Serial No. 5 thus
! would receive Order No. 2; Regis
tration Serial No. 5100 would receive
Order No. 3, etc.
The drawing thus determines the
sequence in which men will be
classified and considered for serv
ice by local draft boards which will
classify the men.
(The local Palo Alto Draft Board
has already posted registration
numbers for the 4355 prospective
draftees in this area. The first
classification questionnaires will be
mailed to all those whose numbers
are picked from the "fishbowl" to
day in approximately one week,
local authorities reported.)

Assuming that numbers are

WASHINGTON, Oct. 28 (UP). —The draft-age men of America look to
the luck of the draw tomorrow.
It's draft lottery day—4he day of the biggest and most serious game of
