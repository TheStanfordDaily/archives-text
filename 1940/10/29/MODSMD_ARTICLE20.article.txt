# Ucla Festival Starts Friday
## 
### HAP EVERETT 
Still slightly dizzy from the effects
of its suicide gridiron schedule,
U.C.L.A. will stage a tremendous
three-day homecoming this week
end at Westwood with Stanford as
guest of honor.
Apparently precedent isn't going to
bother the Bin ins. The last time
they started getting friendly before
a big game was at Berkeley two
weeks ago when their underdog big
brothers from Cal put out the wel
come mat and rudely upset the
Uclans 9-6.
GOOD SPIRITS UNLUCKY
After two days of joint celebra
tion with the Bears in which all
rivalry was dissolved into good spir
its, the favored southerners went
out there and lost by the margin of
a field goal for the third time this
season.
Pierce Gannon, chairman of
homecoming, is counting on an upset
Saturday afternoon to climax the
big week-end but the Indian ball
club has already shown its contempt
for such affairs. Two weeks ago,
Washington State alumni and stu
dents were staging Pullman's great
est homecoming celebration since the
days of Ed Goddard. Along came
the Indians and blasted the Pride
of Palouse right out of Rogers
Field.
CELEBRATION PLANNED
But even if Stanford's football
team docs choose to put the damper
on the U.C.L.A. homecoming this
week-end, the citizens of Westwood
are determined to have a good time
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday
morning. Gannon and his henchmen
have planned a mammoth Breakfast
Club gathering, radio broadcast, and
parade.
Open house at U.C.L.A. fraterni
ties and sororities will get more and
more open as Bruin alumni arrive
from all over the world (Los An
geles County) and Slanford men
and women roll in from the north.
Orrin Tucker has been signed for
the big dance Friday night and
Gannon urges Stanford to get down
in time for this gala event.
Stanford's special train leaves at
8:45 o'clock Friday and returns at
6:45 o'clock Monday morning with
round trip tickets priced at $10.

bother the Bin ins. The last time
they started getting friendly before
a big game was at Berkeley two
weeks ago when their underdog big
brothers from Cal put out the wel
come mat and rudely upset the
Uclans 9-6.
GOOD SPIRITS UNLUCKY
After two days of joint celebra
tion with the Bears in which all
rivalry was dissolved into good spir
its, the favored southerners went
out there and lost by the margin of
a field goal for the third time this
season.
Pierce Gannon, chairman of
homecoming, is counting on an upset
Saturday afternoon to climax the
big week-end but the Indian ball
club has already shown its contempt
for such affairs. Two weeks ago,
Washington State alumni and stu
dents were staging Pullman's great
est homecoming celebration since the
days of Ed Goddard. Along came
the Indians and blasted the Pride
of Palouse right out of Rogers
Field.
CELEBRATION PLANNED
But even if Stanford's football
team docs choose to put the damper
on the U.C.L.A. homecoming this
week-end, the citizens of Westwood
are determined to have a good time
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday
morning. Gannon and his henchmen
have planned a mammoth Breakfast
Club gathering, radio broadcast, and
parade.
Open house at U.C.L.A. fraterni
ties and sororities will get more and
more open as Bruin alumni arrive
from all over the world (Los An
geles County) and Slanford men
and women roll in from the north.
Orrin Tucker has been signed for
the big dance Friday night and
Gannon urges Stanford to get down
in time for this gala event.
Stanford's special train leaves at
8:45 o'clock Friday and returns at
6:45 o'clock Monday morning with
round trip tickets priced at $10.
Still slightly dizzy from the effects
of its suicide gridiron schedule,
U.C.L.A. will stage a tremendous
three-day homecoming this week
end at Westwood with Stanford as
guest of honor.
Apparently precedent isn't going to
bother the Bin ins. The last time
they started getting friendly before
a big game was at Berkeley two
weeks ago when their underdog big
brothers from Cal put out the wel
come mat and rudely upset the
Uclans 9-6.
