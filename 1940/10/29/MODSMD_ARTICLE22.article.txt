# Fascist Troops Smash At Borders of Greece; Turkey Watches Soviet
## Britain Sends Men, Warships To Greek Base 
### United Press 
Premier Benito Musolini sent
his Italian legions smashing al
Greece Monday and within a few
days, perhaps even only hours,
war may engulf all the Balkan*.
Befgrade reports that Russia
had protested to Germany and
Italy against the Balkan push were
scoffed at in Berlin and Moscow
and Fascists in Rome contended
that Russia had agreed well in
advance to the move against
Greece.
It seems that Turkey will tin
what Moscow tells her to do, re
gardless of any pact with Britain.
Furthermore, the Ankara govern
ment wants to see how extensive
and effective Britain's aid to Greece
is before it makes a fateful decision.
ENGLISH AID
British aid appeared to Ix? forth
coming speedily and, according to
unconfirmed Balkan reports, Brit
ish warships and troops already
have taken over the Greek naval
base of Salonika at; the top of the
Aegean â€” key to the Dardanelles
and the goal of Italy's armed forces
now battling the Greeks along the
Albanian border 150 miles to the
west.
But aid on land and in the air
may be more difficult for the British
because (1) the British land forces
in the Near East are none too large
and (2) like Holland and Belgium,
Greece, in striving to remain at
peace, was reluctant to enter into
any defense plan with the British.
The Italians asserted Monday
night that the war against Greece
really wasn't under way yet, thai
full opportunity was being given
Premier John Metaxas and his
Athens government to reconsider
and capitulate to Mussolini's ulti
matum demanding the right to place
Italian armed forces anywhere on
Greek territory.
WAR STARTS' TODAY
But today, the Italians claimed,
will begin the war in earnest with
widespread bombing attacks and
the landing of parachute troops on
the Greek islands and mainland.
The Greeks, in an official com
munique early today, said they
were defending themselves "vigor
ously" in vigorous fighting along the
northwestern frontier with Albania.
In many instances, according to
Jugoslav border reports, the at
tacking Italians were hurled bark
with heavy losses find were able to
capture only two or three towns,
giving them not more than a 10-
mile-deep foothold on Greek terri
tory.
If the Italian armies beat down
Greek resistance along the frontier
they probably will strike with mech
anized units 150 miles across Mace
donia toward Salonika.
