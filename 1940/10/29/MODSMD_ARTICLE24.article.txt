catacombs. When Stanfordites en
ter the basketball pavilion on the
night of Nov. 8, they will find them
selves surrounded by the mystery
of the past.
Dancers will enter from the fa
miliar campus into the dimly lighted
atmosphere and dark shadows of an
ancient burial place far below the

front lobby and adjoining passage
ways will simulate the musty mazes
of the catacombs.
DEVIL'S PUNCH BOWL
Cobwebs will hang from the dark
Ceiling to add to the eeriness of the
surroundings. The entrance will
fcive the effect of entering a rocky

•walls. Animated skeletons and
j'hosts will quench the thirst of the'
♦lancers with liquids brewed in the
devil's punch bowl.
The main dance floor will offer
relief from the dimness of the en
trance. In the center of the room a
color ball of mirrors will reflect
multi - colored lights around the
floor and walls.
CARMINE TO SING
