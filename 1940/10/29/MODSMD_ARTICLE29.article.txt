# Army Develops Farm Invention
## 
### 
With all possible haste and se
crecy, the army is developing a
Stanford invention which will be
an important military strategem,
according to Dr. Russell V. Lee,
spokesman at a luncheon of the
Stanford Associates at the Bohe
mian Club yeserday. Dr. Lee in
troduced the four inventors of the
klystron to the club members.
Less than two years ago the Stan
ford Physics Department announced
the achievement of Professors W.
W. Hansen and D. L. Webster and
Research Associates Russell and
Sigurd Varian, and since then in
tensive experiments on the klystron
have been under way at the Army's
Wright Field and at the laboratories
of the Sperry Gyroscope Company.
MANUFACTURERS MOVE
The Sperry Company, which is
licensed to manufacture the kly
stron under Stanford University's
patent, has recently moved to New
York to facilitate production and
distribution of the instrument, vi
tally necessary to the Army.
The klystron, Stanford Associates
were told, is an ultra-short wave
radio tube, which will be used by
the Army for the blind landing of
planes. The physical principle which
makes the tube work consists of an
ingenious linkage of two resonators
called "rhumbatrons," which inter
rupt the speed of a steady flow of
electrons, causing the electrons to
collect in groups or bunches, and
give oft' their power in radiation.
EXTRA-SHORT WAVES
Klystron models now in produc
tion emit waves of ten centimeters,
about four inches, in length and
even shorter wave lengths are said
to be clearly attainable.
Professor Terman, head of elec
trical engineering department, spoke
today of the instrument's poten
tialities in television and long-dis
tance telephone wavecasting. Ter
man will continue the development
of the klvsron here at Stanford.
