The dance and music of Bali are
living arts, influenced by locale and
changing with the time, whereas in
Java the dance and music are tra
ditional.
NATIVE ORCHESTRA
Besides the dancers, a native
gamelin orchestra will appear on
the stage playing rhythmic accom
paniments on native instruments, in
cluding gongs, cymbals, wooden
xylophones, Javanese violins, war
drums, and bamboo clappers.
Until recently the Bali and Java
nese form of dance was a jealously
guarded secret. Only through word
of-mouth accounts of tourists and
the writing of professional globe
trotters was it possible to get the
faintest conception of an art that
accompanies every stage of the na
tive's life.
Devi Dja is the originator of this
group. When a tour was made
thi*ough Java several years ago by
Anna Pavlowa, Devi Dja decided to
keep dancing and to bring a troupe
representative of her country's cus
toms to the outer woi-ld.
