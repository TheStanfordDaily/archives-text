# Stanford Crew Launches First Shell, Second Year
## 
### HAL SHAFER 
"Ready all!— Hike!"
The Stanford crew dug in as a man, and the practice scow skimmed
away from the float.
Somebody taught a crah, spraying the cox'n in the chill morning
breeze, but the Stanford crew looked good.
Ted Cole, one of the crew's Founding Fathers, turned away from the
men who were taking their Saturday morning workout and. with a gleam

of pride in his eyes, said:
"We've been getting the best
coaching in the country, this morn
ing." .
EBKIGHT COACHES
Out there in the Redwood City
Yacht Harbor, standing in the bow
of the scow, barking orders, was a
trim figure that looked like he be
longed in the stands at Bay Mead
ows. It was California's ace coach
and Poughkeepsie champion — Ky
Ebright.
The lads were turning to with a
will under Ky's valuable guidance,
but there was another reason for the
unusual exuberance — Saturday
morning was to mark another step
forward in their effort to revive crew
at Stanford.
FIRST SHELL
Their first shell was due to arrive
any minute, a donation of the Uni
versity of California crew.
Obtaining a shell for practice and
building of a float in the Redwood
slough have been the major ob
stacles confronting crew officials.
First step in resurrecting crew at
Stanford, under a tombstone since
1921, was the construction of a
practice' scow, in use since last
spring.
It's a story of determination. Con
struction of the scow is vividly re
lated in a paper prepared by Carl
Gerlach, ardent crewer:
"We sweated, we. went without
eating at times, we spent all our
money, forgot about jobs we needed

to work our way through school,
forgot about studies, dates, and
worked nights; but, we made our
patterns, moulded our castings, |
forged our braces, made our adjust
able footboards and rolling seats and !
produced a non-leaking boat bet
ter than California or Washington
could boast."
Cole estimates it will be four
years before the crew enters inter
collegiate competition. Immediate
outlook of the crew finds probable
spring competition with junior col- I
lege crews such as Sacramento and
Compton.
EXPENSE PROBLEMS
Probably the biggest problem at
present is procuring and maintain
ing adequate shells, which cost a
mere $1200 apiece.
But prospects look good. Crew at
Stanfoi'd has not only been resusci
tated, but is drawing full, healthy
breaths.
When the new shell pulled up to
the float on the top of a Cal bus
Saturday, those boys really made
some noise. If enthusiasm is all
Stanford's crew needs, it won't be
long till the lads are taking them
on at Poughkeepsie, just as the
Cards did in 1915.
It was believed, in 1891, that the
expenses of the student should not
exceed $200 per year, exclusive of
clothing and railway fare.

forgot about studies, dates, and
worked nights; but, we made our
patterns, moulded our castings, |
forged our braces, made our adjust
able footboards and rolling seats and !
produced a non-leaking boat bet
ter than California or Washington
could boast."
Cole estimates it will be four
years before the crew enters inter
collegiate competition. Immediate
outlook of the crew finds probable
spring competition with junior col- I
lege crews such as Sacramento and
Compton.
EXPENSE PROBLEMS
Probably the biggest problem at
present is procuring and maintain
ing adequate shells, which cost a
mere $1200 apiece.
But prospects look good. Crew at
Stanfoi'd has not only been resusci
tated, but is drawing full, healthy
breaths.
When the new shell pulled up to
the float on the top of a Cal bus
Saturday, those boys really made
some noise. If enthusiasm is all
Stanford's crew needs, it won't be
long till the lads are taking them
on at Poughkeepsie, just as the
Cards did in 1915.
It was believed, in 1891, that the
expenses of the student should not
exceed $200 per year, exclusive of
clothing and railway fare.
"Ready all!— Hike!"
The Stanford crew dug in as a man, and the practice scow skimmed
away from the float.
Somebody taught a crah, spraying the cox'n in the chill morning
breeze, but the Stanford crew looked good.
Ted Cole, one of the crew's Founding Fathers, turned away from the
men who were taking their Saturday morning workout and. with a gleam

of pride in his eyes, said:
"We've been getting the best
coaching in the country, this morn
ing." .
EBKIGHT COACHES
Out there in the Redwood City
Yacht Harbor, standing in the bow
of the scow, barking orders, was a
trim figure that looked like he be
longed in the stands at Bay Mead
ows. It was California's ace coach
and Poughkeepsie champion — Ky
Ebright.
The lads were turning to with a
will under Ky's valuable guidance,
but there was another reason for the
unusual exuberance — Saturday
morning was to mark another step
forward in their effort to revive crew
at Stanford.
FIRST SHELL
Their first shell was due to arrive
any minute, a donation of the Uni
versity of California crew.
Obtaining a shell for practice and
building of a float in the Redwood
slough have been the major ob
stacles confronting crew officials.
First step in resurrecting crew at
Stanford, under a tombstone since
1921, was the construction of a
practice' scow, in use since last
spring.
It's a story of determination. Con
struction of the scow is vividly re
lated in a paper prepared by Carl
Gerlach, ardent crewer:
"We sweated, we. went without
eating at times, we spent all our
money, forgot about jobs we needed

to work our way through school,
forgot about studies, dates, and
worked nights; but, we made our
patterns, moulded our castings, |
forged our braces, made our adjust
able footboards and rolling seats and !
produced a non-leaking boat bet
ter than California or Washington
could boast."
