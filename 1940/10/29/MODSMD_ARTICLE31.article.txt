stringent observance of the Uni

Excuses claiming that the stu
dents did not see the "Faculty Only"
signs have been discredited by the
Council on the basis that not only
are the signs plainly visible, but
also because of publicity given this
particular infraction in the news
columns of The Daily.
Thirteen fines alone weie given
by Council for parking in the fac
ulty lot. Others were presented for
.speeding and other parking viola
tions.
"Due to the fact that parking fa
cilities on campus are limited, we
try to treat the violators as leniently
as possible," asserted Chairman
Wilson Cannon, "but nevertheless
we expect full co-operation from the
students. This goes for speeding,
also."

California farm income showed a
sharp rise during the spring months,
followed by about a 50 per cent
decline.
