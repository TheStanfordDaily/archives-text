### JERRY BRUCKER 
pARADOXES and such. People!
that go in for that sort of thing ;
can find one right here on the Stan- !
ford campus. His name is Frankie
Albert.
Before the right honorable Mr. j
Albert gets mad and declares war
on Slants, let me, in the words of I
the immortal Stevenson, explain.
Frankie Albeit has a five-game
average of 0.4 yards gained run
ning per play. Which is just about
as low as that of any regular
hackfield man in the country. Yet
this same Frank Albert is the lead
ing scorer of the Pacific Coast
Conference with 27 points.
His closest competition is being
furnished by two teammates, Pete
Kmetovie and Norm Standlee, with
24 points per each.
You're welcome, Mr. Ripley.

TJTARRY SHIPKEY has come up
with another pulverizing frosh
eleven. This edition of the Papoose
machine seems to have even more
get-up and move than the last two,
which were far from bad.
Two years ago the frosh, with
Frankie Albert and Pete Kmetovie
sparking the team, went through j
their season undefeated and un
tied for the first time is ,'] 7 years, i
Last year's Shipkeymen, with |
little A1 Cole providing the inspi- I
ration, dropped only one game, a
one-point heartbreaker to the Tro
babes in the Coliseum.
This year the frosh seem a cinch
for an undefeated season and a
Little Four championship. This |
squad looks even better than the >
two preceding.
The most promising part of the |
picture is that no one man has
starred on this eleven. Several
players have given good accounts
of themselves, but no one has been
a standout consistently.
The sly gag Shipkey pulled on the
Trobabes Saturday illustrated the
plentiful material present. He started
iho second half with a second string
hackfield, made up of speed backs,
in contrast to the power quartet that
struggled through the first half
without too much success.
Lucky Louie is still faring pretty j
well. Three ties cut the list of Fri
day's predictions down to seven, six !
of which were right. Following the j
usual procedure, Louie threw out the
three ties when computing his sea- J
son average.
The standings—Won 28. lost 8,
percentage, 77.7.

that go in for that sort of thing ;
can find one right here on the Stan- !
ford campus. His name is Frankie
Albert.
Before the right honorable Mr. j
Albert gets mad and declares war
on Slants, let me, in the words of I
the immortal Stevenson, explain.
Frankie Albeit has a five-game
average of 0.4 yards gained run
ning per play. Which is just about
as low as that of any regular
hackfield man in the country. Yet
this same Frank Albert is the lead
ing scorer of the Pacific Coast
Conference with 27 points.
His closest competition is being
furnished by two teammates, Pete
Kmetovie and Norm Standlee, with
24 points per each.
You're welcome, Mr. Ripley.

TJTARRY SHIPKEY has come up
with another pulverizing frosh
eleven. This edition of the Papoose
machine seems to have even more
get-up and move than the last two,
which were far from bad.
Two years ago the frosh, with
Frankie Albert and Pete Kmetovie
sparking the team, went through j
their season undefeated and un
tied for the first time is ,'] 7 years, i
Last year's Shipkeymen, with |
little A1 Cole providing the inspi- I
ration, dropped only one game, a
one-point heartbreaker to the Tro
babes in the Coliseum.
This year the frosh seem a cinch
for an undefeated season and a
Little Four championship. This |
squad looks even better than the >
two preceding.
The most promising part of the |
picture is that no one man has
starred on this eleven. Several
players have given good accounts
of themselves, but no one has been
a standout consistently.
The sly gag Shipkey pulled on the
Trobabes Saturday illustrated the
plentiful material present. He started
iho second half with a second string
hackfield, made up of speed backs,
in contrast to the power quartet that
struggled through the first half
without too much success.
Lucky Louie is still faring pretty j
well. Three ties cut the list of Fri
day's predictions down to seven, six !
of which were right. Following the j
usual procedure, Louie threw out the
three ties when computing his sea- J
son average.
The standings—Won 28. lost 8,
