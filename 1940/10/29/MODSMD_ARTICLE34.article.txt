# Unbeaten, Untied Indians Head for Sixth Straight
## 
### 
Now under the scrutiny of football fans the nation over as a member
of the rapidly shrinking list of unbeaten, untied elevens still left in the
country, Stanford's spectacular Indians, still exhilarated by their last
minute victory over U.S.C.'s Thundering Herd, prepared for its sixth

win of the season.
Their opponent next Saturday in
Los Angeles is probably the best
team in the country to have lost five
straight ball games â€” the U.C.L.A.
Bruins. Beaten twice 7-0, twice 9-6,
and once 9-7, the boys from West
wood have never been outclassed
and cannot be discarded in the
minds of Coach Clark Shaughnessy's
Warriors as a "breather" team.
NEW PLAYS DEVELOPED
The first-stringers as well as
those reserves who saw a lot of ac
tion against the Trojans took things
easy yesterday, heading for the
shower room after an hour and a
half of signal practice on some more
new offense. Shaughnessy's bag of
tricks seems bottomless, and for the
sixth straight week he has the Cards
cooking up some untouched forma
tions and plays.
WARNECKE STILL OUT
After the bruising U.S.C. struggle,
Shaughnessy's list of injuries has
mounted up again. Pete Kmetovie,
though he was in a suit, worked out
rather stiffly, bothered by a hip
pointer sustained in Saturday's fray.
Chuck Taylor's sprained ankle
kept him under wraps yesterday,
but both he and Kmetovie will
probably be in shape for U.C.L.A.
game if their coach wants or has to
use them. The only doubtful starter
for this coming Saturday's game is
Rod Warnecke. Rod was in a suit
yesterday but was unable to wear
sr jlder pads because of his still
sore shoulder.
