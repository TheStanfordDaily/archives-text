# Frosh Coach Fears Upset In Breather
## 
### 
Stanford's high-riding freshman
footballers went hack to work yes
terday in preparation for their
contest with ChafTey Junior College
(his week-end.
Taking into account the Papoose
squad's perfect season records to
date, the ChafTey game ought to be
a breather. But when a team is on
top it has no breather games, for
every opponent is pointing for that
team and the glory that would come
with a victory over it.
Cases of little known teams up
setting undefeated ones are all too
frequent to permit Coach Harry
Shipkey and his charges to let down
a bit this week in anticipation of
the Little Big Game the following
Saturday. Overconfidence has been
the nemesis of many a winning elev
en, and Shipkey isn't counting on
letting it upset his outfit's chances
tor an undefeated season.
The fine play of the second Pap
oose backfield, which drove to the
first i'rosh tally Saturday, gives
Shipkey added strength to toss
against Chaffey and the Cal Frosh,
Stanford's two remaining opponents.
Especially encouraging was the
fancy running of Frank Forbes,
little reserve left halfback, who car
ried the. mail most of the time in
the first Papoose touchdown drive.
Forbes reminded many of A1 Cole
by his nifty sprints through the
Trobabe secondary.
