T~)OLITICAL campaigning is entering that last
Ju strenuous one-week period. Wendell Will
kie, now in Kentucky, is speaking again about
the third term and its enslavement of the indi
vidual to the state. Mr. Willkie's voice is be
ginning to get a little hoarse.
But Mr. Roosevelt, after visiting five boroughs
of metropolitan New York and three New Jersey
cities, was still in fine voice last night. He
charged Republican leadership with playing
politics with national security and asserted that
defeat of the New Deal would make America the
victim of the same forces that led to the collapse
of France.
This sort of frenzied oratory will continue, we
know from past experience, until the eve of the
election. Mirroring this national political ten
sion is Stanford's own swiftly growing interest
in the campaign and its issues.
The intense rivalry between parties has been
conditioned this year as never before by events
that have broader significance—the draft draw
ing today, the rapidly growing crisis in the Bal
kans, and the continual aerial warfare between
Berlin and London.
These things dwarf purely local matters. Yet
America—and Stanford—are conscious of the
fact that the nation will elect its chief executive
in a few days.
On the eve of past elections the Farm has
taken on all the aspects of a political rally. Stu
dents used to jam the old Assembly Hall to hear
major party cases presented. On some occa
sions Dr. Wilbur has chairmaned gatherings
that have discussed both sides of political meas
ures.
This year student participation in national
politics will be just as complete, just as enthu
siastic. If the foreign scene has captured bigger
slices of the front page than ever before, it has
also served to shadow the typically American
hub-a-hub-a and hurrah of election time with a
greater significance, a more profound impor
tance for each individual voter.
When the Stanford Political Union made its
last-ditch stand for existence last spring—and
lost—a new idea succeeded it this autumn. A
few interested men who believed in discussion
of controversial issues in a democratic way
formed a Stanford Forum. Ex Committee nod
ded approval, and the ambitious new organiza
tion set forth to justify its existence. Its first
really official act will be offered the public to
morrow night when it sponsors the Farm's big
political fracas.
At tomorrow's Stanford Forum speakers from
rival party clubs will present their views on
the presidential race. What they say will be
open to guestion and evaluation.
But Memorial Hall tomorrow night will be
reminiscent of Stanford at election time —1936,
1932, 1928. Stanford talks about issues, freely,
democratically, in open meetings. This year's
problems will find this year's solutions—but
whatever they are, Stanford will discuss them.
