# Lucky Number
## 
### 
LOTTERIES may be illegal in the United
States but today the government itself is
going to personally conduct the biggest raffle
in the history of the country.
And the payoff won't be a set of dishes, or
an electric refrigerator, or even a nice, new,
shiny automobile. Of course, in a way this lot
tery has advantages over most of them that one

runs into at motion picture shows or in dark
corners of the neighborhood billiard palace.
There will be so many more "winners" than
usual. Yes sir, the government is no piker when
it comes to gambling games.
Five-million winners will evolve out of the
"goldfish" bowl from which Secretary of War
Stimson will pull the first "lucky" number.
Each prize—$30.
Oh yes, and room and board.—G. M.
