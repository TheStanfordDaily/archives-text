### BUD, AMES 
THUMBS UP AND DOWN FOR CAL
J-JERE goes for another fling into the field of sport
which seems to be the topic of conversation on
everyone's lips these days. Sports Editor Jerry Brucker
is getting awfully mad about this trampling on his
journalistic toes, but he can't object when the sport
discussion concerns the thing nearest and dearest to
your heart, namely, the Stanford "Wow-boy" Wondex*-
Who's-Got-It(?) football team.
♦ # ♦ *
Apparently our friendly rivalry with California—
that institution somewhere in Berkeley—frequently
gets the best of us. A lot of people missed the point
last Saturday. Stanford should have been rooting for
California. With Washington slated as our toughest op
position for that Rose Bowl bid, it would have been
all to our advantage to have had our arch rival, Cali
fornia, knock off Washington last Saturday.
Nevertheless, a goodly portion cheered last Satur
day when they heard that Washington had come from
behind to knock off the Golden Bears.
Incidentally, despite Washington's win last week,
Stanford is still tied with Minnesota as the second
best team in the country—which sounds awfully good
in any language. Very soon ,it may be next week-end,
Michigan (the top team) and Minnesota are going to
play each other. One has got to lose their first game,
and that will give us undisputed possession of second
place.
A tie would be even better. That would make us
top team in the nation. And last year we wound up in
the cellar, the dark, dark cellar of the Coast Con
ference.
* * * 4
week we should have been rooting for Cali
fornia. Now we should pull a Dr. Jekyll and root
the other way—for Washington. That is, of course,
only so far. What we mean is that Coach Jimmy
Phelan of Washington has started a beef with Stub
Allison of California which may have important bear
ing on this year's Big Game.
After last week's game, Phelan complained, bitterly,
publicly, and in print, against the "rocker-shift" which
the California eleven is now using. This rocker-shift,
for your edification, is a slight bobble, a slight jerk
made by the linemen a couple of counts before the
play actually begins. It's a nasty trick, and one which
throws opposing linemen off balance because they
think the play has started. Phelan wants to throw it
out of the conference.
Now this isn't the first time that this beef has ap
peared in Coast football. A couple of years ago the
Pacific Coast Conference voted a strong thumbs-down
on this rocker-shift as a nasty practice. Stub Allison
said "okey," and agreed not to use the shift. So last
Saturday the California men used it in playing Wash
ington.
So tonight it might help if you say an extra little
prayer not for Washington (the gateway to the Rose
Bowl) but for Washington's coach, Jimmy Phelan,
who may be the making or breaking of our forward
wall in the coming Cal-Stanford game. Possibly the
king of them all, Coach Shaughnessy, will have some
thing to say about this, and soon, too.
And don't overlook Cal just because they have been
losing—but very consistently. With their rocker shift
they were able to push Washington around. That may
go for us, too.

So tonight it might help if you say an extra little
prayer not for Washington (the gateway to the Rose
Bowl) but for Washington's coach, Jimmy Phelan,
who may be the making or breaking of our forward
wall in the coming Cal-Stanford game. Possibly the
king of them all, Coach Shaughnessy, will have some
thing to say about this, and soon, too.
And don't overlook Cal just because they have been
losing—but very consistently. With their rocker shift
they were able to push Washington around. That may
go for us, too.
THUMBS UP AND DOWN FOR CAL
J-JERE goes for another fling into the field of sport
which seems to be the topic of conversation on
everyone's lips these days. Sports Editor Jerry Brucker
is getting awfully mad about this trampling on his
journalistic toes, but he can't object when the sport
discussion concerns the thing nearest and dearest to
your heart, namely, the Stanford "Wow-boy" Wondex*-
Who's-Got-It(?) football team.

Apparently our friendly rivalry with California—
that institution somewhere in Berkeley—frequently
gets the best of us. A lot of people missed the point
last Saturday. Stanford should have been rooting for
California. With Washington slated as our toughest op
position for that Rose Bowl bid, it would have been
all to our advantage to have had our arch rival, Cali
fornia, knock off Washington last Saturday.
Nevertheless, a goodly portion cheered last Satur
day when they heard that Washington had come from
behind to knock off the Golden Bears.
Incidentally, despite Washington's win last week,
Stanford is still tied with Minnesota as the second
best team in the country—which sounds awfully good
in any language. Very soon ,it may be next week-end,
Michigan (the top team) and Minnesota are going to
play each other. One has got to lose their first game,
and that will give us undisputed possession of second
place.
A tie would be even better. That would make us
top team in the nation. And last year we wound up in
the cellar, the dark, dark cellar of the Coast Con
ference.
* * * 4
week we should have been rooting for Cali
fornia. Now we should pull a Dr. Jekyll and root
the other way—for Washington. That is, of course,
only so far. What we mean is that Coach Jimmy
Phelan of Washington has started a beef with Stub
Allison of California which may have important bear
ing on this year's Big Game.
After last week's game, Phelan complained, bitterly,
publicly, and in print, against the "rocker-shift" which
the California eleven is now using. This rocker-shift,
for your edification, is a slight bobble, a slight jerk
made by the linemen a couple of counts before the
play actually begins. It's a nasty trick, and one which
throws opposing linemen off balance because they
think the play has started. Phelan wants to throw it
out of the conference.
Now this isn't the first time that this beef has ap
peared in Coast football. A couple of years ago the
Pacific Coast Conference voted a strong thumbs-down
on this rocker-shift as a nasty practice. Stub Allison
said "okey," and agreed not to use the shift. So last
Saturday the California men used it in playing Wash
ington.
