# CAMPUS OPINION
## VERDI VS. GREEN 
### 
r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
I notice in this morning's "Thumbs Up" col
umn the anouncement of an opera called "Rigoletto'.' by
one Joe Green. Now I have been a follower of opera
for several years, but I am not familiar with Mr.
Green's work. I have tried to find out something about
this composer, his life and works, but the usually re
liable "Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians,"
the Taylor-Kerr-Hughes "Music Lovers' Encyclopedia"
and even the "Encyclopedia Brittanica" have failed me,
for alas! I can find no mention of Mr. Green or his
music. „
I can only assume from this that the opera is a very
modern one, and that Mr. Green has risen to fame
since the publication of the aforementioned. If this
is the case, I think it is a bit cocky of composer Green
to select for his new opera the same title that the
Italian master Giuseppe Verdi used for his musical
adaptation of Victor Hugo's "Le Roi S'Amuse" in 1851.
Has Mr. Green used the same plot? That might ex
plain it. In the public interest, I think it would be
fine if the Daily's music critic (who, by the way has
been doing a splendid job on the opera reviews, even
though de Paolis did stink in "Don Giovanni") would
give us a brief sketch of Mr. Green and his new opera
if only to make sure that some of the readers would
not be disappointed upon arriving in the standee line
at the opera house to find that they were attending a
new work instead of the Verdi opera.
Sincerely yours,
Bill Moran
