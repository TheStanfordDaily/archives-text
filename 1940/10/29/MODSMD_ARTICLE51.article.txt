# ENCINAMEN APES?
## 
### 
r |MIE EDITOR, SIR:
1 Tonight upon coming out of the Encina library,
I find fragments of a coke, a broken dish, and some
| paper scattered over the bottom of the main stair well.
In appeal to anything decent that may be left in the
make-up of the guilty party, it looked very disgust
| ing! It requires no superior intellect to throw food.
Any ape could do as well . Stanford was not founded
half a century ago in order that hoodlums might be
! amused. If you must revert to your primitive in
| stincts, why pick on Encina? So give your classmates
and the janitor a break by doing your throwing else
where. (Why not try a baseball or football field?)
Thank you,
i Still Hopeful
