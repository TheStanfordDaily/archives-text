# Jordan's Child Verses Have Whimsical Air
## 
### 
"Eric's Book of Beasts," by David
Starr Jordan. Sale is sponsored by
Cap and Gown for the benefit of the
Convalescent Home. Obtainable
from Mrs. Payson Treat for 75 cents
and $1, for paper-bound or canvass
backed copies, respectively.
Sometimes when a great man is
very, very busy, he is not great
enough to take time to do the little
things that bring a lot of happiness
to people. Most of the time there
aren't enough great men to do the
little things that really count.
WRITTEN FOR SON
But David Starr Jordan wasn't
this kind of a man. He was a k great
man that had plenty of time, be
cause he made it, to do such homely
little things as writing a book of
verse for his young son, Eric. He
was a great man because he was the
first president of Leland Stanford
Junior University. He was a greater
man because he took the time to do
a lot of little things that made people
happy.
Eric used to pester his father to
make up verses for him. So David
Jordan would sit down and accom
pany water color cartoons drawn by
him in his leisure, he would pen
verses. Result is this book of animal
verses and sketches. Later Shimada
Sekko did black-and-white sketches
and Paul Elder published it.
•WHIMSICAL APPEAL'
Printed first for all good little boys
and girls in May of 1912, the whim
sical appeal of the delightful lines
and sketches includes a following of
adults who, after all, are only older
boys and girls.
You might want it because you are
sentimental about owning something
of David Starr Jordan's. We admire
that. But we want it because it has
that Peter Pan appeal that, after all,
is the most fun to read about.—
