## Young Politicos To Speak at 7:30 
### 
Stanford Young Republicans yes
terday named four debators to go
to the post tomorrow night to chal
lenge the campus Democrats in the
first meeting of the new Stanford
Forum in Memorial Auditorium at
7:30 o'clock.
Tomorrow night's pre-election
rally is calculated to fire up stu
dent interest for Thursday's stu
dent election, in which all Stanford
students, regardless of age, will
name their choice in a straw Presi
dential vote.
Republicans who will sing the j
song of Wendell Willkie are Ann
Killefer, Barney Gill. Jim Kessler,
and Hugh O'Donnell. These four will
debate four prominent Young Dem
ocrats, Sylvia Berry, Bob Newell,
Bob Beckham, and Bob Low.
BRUCE JESSUP TO JUDGE
Guest moderator will be Bruce
Jessup, A.S.S.U. president, who
stated yesterday:
"The Forum meeting tomorrow
night promises to be very interest
ing and worth while. It deserves all
the support that we as students can
give it."
Jack Laughlin, Young Republican
president, claimed:
"The voters who are now on the
fence will have no doubt that Wen
dell L. Willkie should be the next
President of the United States, after
the debate tomorrow night."
DEMOCRATS DEFENSIVE
Bob Beckham, Young Democrats
head, spoke for the Roosevelt sup
porters:
"We plan to be strictly on the
defensive, due to the attacks of
Willkie and the Republican party on
President Roosevelt. We're not say
ing all the things Roosevelt has done
have been good, but we think he
can discharge the presidential du
ties better than Willkie can."
Tomorrow night's conclave will be
the first meeting sponsored by the
newly created Stanford Forum,
which replaces the former Stanford
Political Union.
