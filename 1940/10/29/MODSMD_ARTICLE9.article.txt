# Drama Professor To Talk Over KPO
## 
### 
Miss Claire MacGregor. assistant
professor of speech and drama, will
discuss the speech problems in Ha
waii when she speaks tomorrow af
ternoon on the Stanford radio pro
gram at 5:30 o'clock over KPO.
Miss MacGregor will include in
her discussion the three serious ob
stacles which she believes stand in
the way of establishing standards of
English speech in Hawaii.
They are: first, the prevalent use
of the native tongue and "pidgin
English" within the home; second,
constant abuse of the English lan
guage by English-speaking peoples
in their daily conversation with the
Oriental; and third, the personal dis
interest of the student himself in
learning to speak the English lan- j
guage.
She believes that the solution of
these problems may be accom
plished by the American schools in
their teaching of the next-generation j
Oriental.
