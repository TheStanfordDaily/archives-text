JJTALY has started to Vage total |
war against Greece, although Mus- ;
solini insists the conflict is a purely j
local one between Greece and Al- i
bania.
The spearhead of the Italian at- j
tack evidently is aimed at Salonika, j
Greek port on the Aegean Sea which |
is some 90 miles from the Albanian ;
border as the crow flies but close i
to 140 miles overland through some j
of the most difficult terrain in Eu- j
rope. The Italians want to seize i
this port before the British fleet can '
land a sizeable defending force j
there.
But reports from Athens as j
early as yesterday indicated that 1
small detachments of British
troops had already landed in Sa
lonika. If the British arc able to
place a strong force in Salonika
within any short time, the Axis
may be forced to move into Greece
from the north â€” a move which
will require the invasion of either
Bulgaria or Yugoslavia. Salonika
is only some 50 miles from the
Yugoslav border and the terrain
is much easier than over the
mountainous route from Albania.

MUSSOLINI, it is assumed, has
three objectives in Greece:
First, the occupation of Salonika
-s a base of operations; second, seiz
ure of the Gx-eek island of Corfu at
the mouth of the Adriatic; and
third, domination of the entire Hel
lenic peninsula in order to isolate
Turkey.
Italian success in attaining these
objectives would certainly influence
Turkey, wavering between the
British and the Axis, to give up
British friendship, which may result
in armed conflict, in favor of some
agreement with the Axis.
But Italian failure in Greece will
give the British an excellent oppor
tunity to strengthen her position in
the eastern Mediterranean. For one
thing, British bombing expeditions
over Italian industrial centers
would be greatly facilitated if the
British had bases in Greece. Italian
industrial areas, to an even greater
extent than British industrial ai*eas,
are concentrated in a few localities,
and Italian military might would
suffer from intensified bombing of
these localities.
Another possible consequence of
British occupation of Greece is the
bombing of the Rumanian oil
fields. To date, this has not been
possible because of their great
distance from British plane bases.
There is much at stake in the
battle over Greece and it may be
expected that Italian failure here
will bring support from Germany in
the form of an overland attack on
Greece through Bulgaria and Yu
goslavia.

| from London and
from Athens have not disclosed
the extent of British aid, but specu
lation has persisted that Mussolini
expected Greece to succumb with
out resisting and that he is not pre
pared to conquer the country him
self with any great speed.
Turkey is still watching the situa
tion closely and there have been
both reports that she will enter the
war on the side of Greece at any
moment and that she will remain
neutral as long as Russia can do so.
In Russia's attitude remains the
key to the entire situation, and re
ports from Moscow concerning the
Russian position have been con
spicuously lacking. The only men
tion of Russia's present Balkan
policy came from London, where it
was rumored that the Soviet would
abandon her traditional interest in
the straits in an effort to avoid con
flict wtih Although this
was in no way confirmed in any
European capital, it seemed quite
feasible to observers in the United
States.
British government spokesmen
have on several occasions said that
they had given up all hope of Rus
sian resistance to any Axis push
toward the Dardanelles. The next
few days will tell whether there was
any truth to these statements.
