# Students Will Argue Willkie vs. Roosevelt In Auditorium, 7:30
## 
### 
What happens when the irre
sistible force meets the immovable
object?
By all rights that's a physicist's
question. But it's the question Stan
ford men and women may well be
asking tonight when they file into
Memorial Auditorium at 7:30 o'clock
for the first meeting of the Stanford
Forum.
Up there on the stage, behind a
speaker's rostrum, four Young
Democrats and four Young Repub
licans will, in turn, bombard or
build up Franklin D. Roosevelt and
Wendell L. Willkie.
Democratic speakers are Sylvia
Berry, Bob Newell, Bob Beckham,
and Bob Low. Republicans who
will take the rostrum are Joe Morin,
Jim Kessler, Barney Gill, and Den
nis Green. Guest moderator will be
Bruce Jessup, A.S.S.U. president.
Promising to pull no punches, Low
yesterday challenged:
"It's up to the Republicans to
show that Roosevelt's faults out
weigh his recognized accomplish
ments, and to show that, their candi
date is better qualified to be Presi
dent during the present crisis. We
Democrats will stand on Roosevlt's
record."
Republican speaker Green com
mented briefly:
"A third term is against the tra
ditional American system of party
checks."
Newell said:
"Recognizing certain shortcom
ings, I say the Democratic program
is typified by the Roosevelt admin
istration, but my conviction in the
desirability of re-electing Roosevelt
lies more specifically in the fact
that the Republicans are deluding
themselves about the capabilities of
Mr. Willkie, who seems to be a typ
ical Wall Street corporation lawyer,
in view of his record as president
of Commonwealth and Southern
holding company.
