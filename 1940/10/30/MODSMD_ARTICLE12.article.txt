# National Lottery Draws Names of 24 Stanford Men, Two Professors
## Stimson Draws No. 158 First; 800,000 Added 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 29 (UP). —
Blue pellets drawn from a goldfish
bowl in the nation's first peacetime 1
draft lottery tonight called up the j
class of 1940—800,000 strong—to aid '
in safeguarding the hemisphere in a
world aflame.
There# were 9,000 capsules in the
10-gallon jar at noon when Presi
dent Roosevelt appeared personally
in Departmental Auditorium to ex
plain in a speech that the muster
was needed to make the country
strong so it may continue to live
in "freedom and in peace."
158 IS FIRST DRAWN
In the capsules lay fresh hopes for
some and disappointment for oth
ers of the 17,000,000 men between 21
and 35 years who registered for se
lective service. They will be classi
fied according to answers to ques
tionnaires which will go out first to
those whose numbers emerged first
from the bowl today.
The drawing continued late into I
the night.
Secretary of War Henry L. Stim- !
son, blindfolded with a strip of linen, !
reached into the bowl at 12:18 p.m.
(E.S.T.) and handed a lottery slip j
to Mr. Roosevelt, who, a moment be- '
fore, had completed his speech be- !
fore a battery of microphones.
DRAMATIC INTERLUDE
"The first number drawn by Sec
retary of War Stimson is—" he be- j
gan.
There was a momentary hush and
then a feminine scream as Mr.
Roosevelt said:
"158."
The outcry came from Mrs. Mil
dred C. Bell, of Washington, D.C.,
who came early and was placidly
knitting while waiting to see if the
number of her son, Robert, 21, a
former student at St. Johns in Balti
more, came up.
There were other mothers, moth
ers of John, the plumber, of Bill,
the clerk, of Sam, the truck driver,
who heard "158" as it was flashed
from coast to coast.
800.000 IN FIRST DRAFT
The President repeated each of
the first 15 numbers as they were
drawn and then left. He had re
ceived a noisy welcome on enter
ing the auditorium, but he was of
solemn mind. It was, he told some
1,000 persons who jammed every
seat and millions in his radio audi
ence, a "most solemn ceremony."
To some 800,000 men it meant a
year of their life. A year in which
they will get a gun, clothing, food,
shelter, training and $21 a month
before they make way for new
trainees.
"We are mustering all of our re
sources, manhood and industry and
wealth to make our nation strong
in defense," the President said.
"For recent history proves all too
clearly, I am sorry to say, that only
the strong may continue to live in
freedom and in peace."
Today those called for training
cannot be sent outside continental
United States or its territorial pos
sessions.
As though sensing the uneasiness
among thousands of Johnnys who
may get their guns when they'd pre
fer to keep the foothold they have
in budding careers, the President
said only 5 per cent of the
registrants would be mustered.
ONLY FIVEVER CENT
"The young men of America have
thought this thing through," h,e
said. "They have not been stimu
lated by or misled by militarist
propaganda. They fully understand
the necessity for national defense
and are ready, as all citizens of
our country must be, to play their
part in it."
October of i 940 almost duplicated
July 1917 when the first number
emerged from the bowl. It was 258
in the first World War lottery and
158 today. Other scenes and some
of the characters were alike. There
was the same bowl and the same
paddle to stir the pellets.
LOTTERY QUICKENS
By mid-afternoon the lottery
swung into full stride. A fresh aide
took his place at the bowl and began
passing capsules back to a trio of
girls who shucked them and handed
them to the tellers.
At 5 p.m. numbers were being
called at the rate of 500 an hour and
it was estimated that the first 2,000
to 2,500 drawn would provide • the
first group of 800,000 selective serv
ice trainees. The theory is that the
first 2,118 numbers drawn would
fill the first call and that it would
be necessary to classify 4,000,000 men
to obtain 800,000 class 1A men who
could be inducted into immediate
service.
