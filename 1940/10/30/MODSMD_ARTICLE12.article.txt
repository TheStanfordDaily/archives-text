# National Lottery Draws Names of 24 Stanford Men, Two Professors
## Stimson Draws No. 158 First; 800,000 Added 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 29 (UP). —
Blue pellets drawn from a goldfish
bowl in the nation's first peacetime 1
draft lottery tonight called up the j
class of 1940—800,000 strong—to aid '
in safeguarding the hemisphere in a
world aflame.
There# were 9,000 capsules in the
10-gallon jar at noon when Presi
dent Roosevelt appeared personally
in Departmental Auditorium to ex
plain in a speech that the muster
was needed to make the country
strong so it may continue to live
in "freedom and in peace."
158 IS FIRST DRAWN
In the capsules lay fresh hopes for
some and disappointment for oth
ers of the 17,000,000 men between 21
and 35 years who registered for se
lective service. They will be classi
fied according to answers to ques
tionnaires which will go out first to
those whose numbers emerged first
from the bowl today.
The drawing continued late into I
the night.
Secretary of War Henry L. Stim- !
son, blindfolded with a strip of linen, !
reached into the bowl at 12:18 p.m.
(E.S.T.) and handed a lottery slip j
to Mr. Roosevelt, who, a moment be- '
fore, had completed his speech be- !
fore a battery of microphones.
DRAMATIC INTERLUDE
"The first number drawn by Sec
retary of War Stimson is—" he be- j
gan.
There was a momentary hush and
then a feminine scream as Mr.
Roosevelt said:
"158."
The outcry came from Mrs. Mil
dred C. Bell, of Washington, D.C.,
who came early and was placidly
knitting while waiting to see if the
number of her son, Robert, 21, a
former student at St. Johns in Balti
more, came up.
There were other mothers, moth
ers of John, the plumber, of Bill,
the clerk, of Sam, the truck driver,
who heard "158" as it was flashed
from coast to coast.
800.000 IN FIRST DRAFT
The President repeated each of
the first 15 numbers as they were
drawn and then left. He had re
ceived a noisy welcome on enter
ing the auditorium, but he was of
solemn mind. It was, he told some
1,000 persons who jammed every
seat and millions in his radio audi
ence, a "most solemn ceremony."
To some 800,000 men it meant a
year of their life. A year in which
they will get a gun, clothing, food,
shelter, training and $21 a month
before they make way for new
trainees.
