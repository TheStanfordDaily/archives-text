# Registrants Scan Numbers In Tense Hush
## 
### WILSON CANNON 
It was cold and foggy out of
doors hut the little room on 514
Bryant was musty-dry and full
of warm humanity. Only a few
men were there. There was but
little conversation.
Elbowing within reading-room of
the first of the registrant lists, the
task of scanning the 4,000-odd names
began. E ich newcomer found "158"
first, then smiled at his neighbor.
More men began to walk up the
stairs and into the room. The tight
little knot about each list thickened.
Now and then one man would break
away and walk down the stairs.
Most jotted a number on a scratch
pad or torn envelope.
AIJ, RACES
Someone bumped your arm and a
stocky negro apologized huskily.
Leaning against the wall waiting for
an opening were two Filipinos. The
next name on the list was that of a
Japanese.
Still more people flowed in. A
most apologetic was the entrance of
a venerable oldster leaning on a
cane. He looked down the line for
a familiar face, Ihen took his place.
He was looking for the names of
his sons. A husky mechanic walked
in with his baby daughter on his
shoulder. The baby thought it was
a game.
WOMEN COME TOO
Three young women came through
the door, laughing as they climbed
the stairs. The men about the lists
moved to let them in.
"Seems funny to think that
people are doing thi.s all over the
country!" No one laughed. Every
one turned to look at the speaker.
Five Farm students rushed up
the stairs. The oldsters grinned at
their haste. They found places be
side one of the files, called names
to one another. "Gee, I just missed
it," called one.
COMMON PURPOSE
The room was almost full. A
white-haired lady leaned against the
rail as she timidly plodded up the
stairs. A Chinese boy was the first
to offer her his arm, the others
backed away to give her room.
She read each name slowly, turn
ing each page with the end of a
pencil. She paused and looked
around the room before she turned
each page.
It was foggy outside, but the loom
was warm.

Now and then one man would break
away and walk down the stairs.
Most jotted a number on a scratch
pad or torn envelope.
AIJ, RACES
Someone bumped your arm and a
stocky negro apologized huskily.
Leaning against the wall waiting for
an opening were two Filipinos. The
next name on the list was that of a
Japanese.
Still more people flowed in. A
most apologetic was the entrance of
a venerable oldster leaning on a
cane. He looked down the line for
a familiar face, Ihen took his place.
He was looking for the names of
his sons. A husky mechanic walked
in with his baby daughter on his
shoulder. The baby thought it was
a game.
WOMEN COME TOO
Three young women came through
the door, laughing as they climbed
the stairs. The men about the lists
moved to let them in.
"Seems funny to think that
people are doing thi.s all over the
country!" No one laughed. Every
one turned to look at the speaker.
Five Farm students rushed up
the stairs. The oldsters grinned at
their haste. They found places be
side one of the files, called names
to one another. "Gee, I just missed
it," called one.
COMMON PURPOSE
The room was almost full. A
white-haired lady leaned against the
rail as she timidly plodded up the
stairs. A Chinese boy was the first
to offer her his arm, the others
backed away to give her room.
She read each name slowly, turn
ing each page with the end of a
pencil. She paused and looked
around the room before she turned
each page.
It was foggy outside, but the loom
was warm.
It was cold and foggy out of
doors hut the little room on 514
Bryant was musty-dry and full
of warm humanity. Only a few
men were there. There was but
little conversation.
Elbowing within reading-room of
the first of the registrant lists, the
task of scanning the 4,000-odd names
began. E ich newcomer found "158"
first, then smiled at his neighbor.
More men began to walk up the
stairs and into the room. The tight
little knot about each list thickened.
Now and then one man would break
away and walk down the stairs.
