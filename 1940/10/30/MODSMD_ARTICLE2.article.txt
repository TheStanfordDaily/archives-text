# U.S., British Citizens Aid Greek Troops, Organize Athens Foreign Brigade

### 
ATHENS, Oct. 29 (Ul*). —United States and British citizens today began
mobilization of Greek International Brigade to reinforce outnumbered but
stubbornly resisting Greek troops battling Italian invaders along the
mountainous northern frontier.
A group of Vcnizelist officers, all first class lighters but dismissed for

their part in the 1935 revolt against
King George, appealed to the mon
arch and Premier John Metaxes to
put political squabbles aside and
send them to the front "in this
gravest hour."
Greece's defending forces were
reported to be holding Italian mech
anized forces to scant gains along
the Albanian border. There was no
talk of anything but a finish fight to
preserve the nation's independence.
ATHENS BOMBING FEARED
Metaxes appealed to Italy to treat
Athens as an open city and spare it
from bombardment but, so far as
could be learned, no reply was
forthcoming.
Shop owners criss-crossed tape
on their windows to prevent shat
tering in event of bombings, and
air raid wardens in steel helmets
moved through the streets among
soldiers in full war kit bound for
the front.
POLICE PROTECT ITALIANS
In the Gulf of Corinth port oi
Patras, west of Athens, steel helmet
ed police and troops were called oul

of the city from angry crowds seek
ing vengeance for Monday's Italiar
air attack in which 50 persons were
killed and at least 100 others in
jured.
