# Ennis Music to Fill Catacombs At Annual Sophomore Cotillion
## 
### JOHNNY LUCAS 
Combining the danceable music
of Skinnay Ennis and his orchestra
and the eerie catacomb theme in
which float ghoulies and beasties and
things that go bump in the night,
the annual Sophomore Cotillion
will be one of the best remembered
dances in this year's calendar.
The Ennis band is famous for its
music on the Bob Hope radio show.
Besides the hearth bellows breath
ing of Skinnay, there will be on
hand Carmine, Ennis' appealing girl
singer, Pete Carpjenter, tenor singer
and hot man on the trambone, and
Sonny Dawson, the yodelling guitar
boy.

Terry Coonan has promised a
thrilling scene for the Cotillion.
! There will be plenty of dim, grue
i some lighting; hideous, gloomy
j shadows; dusky bodies enticing the
I dancers into obscure corners. For
! the price of a bid Stanfordites can
; forget their everyday surroundings
| and wander through storybook fan
j tasy (or horror).
BRIGHT DANCE FLOOR
In order to provide a needed con
trast to the horrible catacomb ad
! venture, the dance floor will be
J gayer and more brightly lighted,
j The Pavilion is being utilized to
