# Grid Team Preps Pass Offensive
## 
### 
Looking as smooth as silk as they
fc-iled through new and old of
fensive plays at yesterday's practice
session, Stanford's undefeated, un
tied gridders prepared for their sixth
straight victory of the 1940 season.
At; usual Coach Clark Shaugh
nessy has styled his team's offense j
ior the coming week-end to capital
ize on the weak spots of the Cards' i
opponents, U.C.L.A.'s Bruins. Though
the Bruins under Coach Babe Hor
rcll have a line touted almost as |
strong as U.S.C.'s, they are sup
posed to be weak on their pass de- J
fense.
Therefore Farm fans can expect j
to see their quart'erback, Frankie
Albert, tossing a lot of his deadly ,
passes in Los Angeles Saturday af
ternoon. However, Shaughnessy
doesn't plan to concentrate his of- !
lense on passing alone and has a !
few new crinkles in the Indian run
ning attack which he expects to
make yardage through the rugged
Bruin forward line.
TWO INJURIES
Two of Shaughnessy's first-string i
linemen have been placed on the j
"doubtful starter" list for Satur- [
day's game. They are rangy Rod I
Warnecke at left tackle and chunky j
Chuck Taylor at left guard. War- !
necke, who injured some muscles'
in hiÂ±> shoulder a week ago yester- 1
day' in scrimmage previous to the '
U.S.C. game, was in a uniform yes- ;
terday, wearing a harness similarj
to what his running mate at the i
other tackle, Bruno Banducci,
wears.
This rig consists of a band J
around the injured arm which is I
fastened by laces to Warnecke's
pants, keeping him from raising his
arm above a certain level. Taylor,
however, was not in a suit yester
day, still resting the ankle he
twisted in the rough and tumble
Trojan game.
ROBESKY TAKES OVER
With Taylor and Warnecke taking
things easy yesterday, John Kerman
moved into the second string line
up at guard, and Ed McCain filled
in at tackle. On the first string the
surprising Ken Robesky and Ed
Stamm filled in for Taylor and War
necke, respectively.
Another newcomer to the second
string was quarterback Thor Peter
son. Thor tossed a couple of beau
tiful passes that missed by a whis
ker of being completed in the dying
minutes of the first half of the
U.S.C. tilt. He now has moved j
ahead of sophomore Ray Hammett j
as the first substitute for Albert on i
(he strength of his all-around run- j
n ' n g> punting, 'and passing ability. 1
now that he has mastered the ball !
handling.
Assistant Coach Husky Hunt's
invaluable bunch of reserves are
again working on opponents' plays
in an effort to give the varsity a
true picture of the Ucla offense. To
morrow these reserves will throw
what Bruin plays they have mas
tered at Shaughnessy's first, and
second stringers and the coaching
staff will go to work at perfecting
a defense to stop Robinson, Overlin,
Cantor and Co.
In scrimmage last night the in
jury bugaboo dug further into the
squad, picking off Ray Hammett,
third-string sophomore quarter,
and Hank Norberg, sophomore end.
Hammett reinjured some ribs.
Norberg. the hard luck kid, came up
wilh a badly injured foot. X-rays
will be taken to rig term ine if there
are any bones broken.
