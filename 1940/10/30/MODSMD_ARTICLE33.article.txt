# Card Splashers To Invade Ucla, S.C. This Week
## 
### 
Preparing for an invasion of
U.C.L.A. and U.S.C. pools this week
end. Stanford's water polo team will
be polishing up on its fast-breaking
offense in hupes of dunking either
one of their favored rivals.
With stress placed on shooting at
every opportunity, the Indians will
be drilling in the 20-yard pool to j
compensate for the use of shorter !
courses in the southern schools.
The Cards will undoubtedly en
ter the two-day tournament in the
underdog spot, b'Jt their potential !
strength, as evidenced by their j
showing last Saturday against the ;
Trojans, will not be overlooked by
either U.S.C. or U.C.L.A.
Stanford started what looked like |
an extremely bleak season w'th only j
two returning veterans. Captain j
Ted Moreno was outstanding last [
year as a guard, and Dave Nottage
saw action in several games. Mo
reno was the only man on the squad
with high school experience behind
him.
DEFENSE INTENSIVE
However, in a recent interview :
Coach Thornton said, "The manner i
in which the boys reached a peak !
in the U.S.C. game was very en
couraging. Holding the strong Tro
jans to a 4-2 score was an achieve
ment. considering the dark outlook
at the beginning of the season. Stan
ford defense is outstanding and
what the Cards lack in offense we
hope to iron out by intensive prac
tice this week."
In comparison with Stanford's
green and inexperienced squad is
the powerful U.C.L.A. contingent.
Five members of last year's con
ference championship team have
played together for four years of
high school and two years of col
lege water polo without dropping a
game.
BRECKNER OUTSTANDING
Outstanding man in the water last
week was goalie Breckner. llis bril
liant saves were largely responsible
for U.S.C.'s low score. Thornton
predicts that if he continues to play
the same brand of ball as he did
Saturday he will make a strong bid
for all-conference honors.
Moreno continued to play his
usual dependable game, while
Mitchell and Jessup teamed up to
hold down Wolf, star of Southern
California's offense. Mitchell, one
of the fastest breaking guards to be
developed at Stanford, played all
around his highly-touted rival.
Howcv(i, Weeden, Nottage, and
Tietien,% rapidly developing for->
wards, were unable to break
: through the tight Trojan defense.

the powerful U.C.L.A. contingent.
Five members of last year's con
ference championship team have
played together for four years of
high school and two years of col
lege water polo without dropping a
game.
BRECKNER OUTSTANDING
Outstanding man in the water last
week was goalie Breckner. llis bril
liant saves were largely responsible
for U.S.C.'s low score. Thornton
predicts that if he continues to play
the same brand of ball as he did
Saturday he will make a strong bid
for all-conference honors.
Moreno continued to play his
usual dependable game, while
Mitchell and Jessup teamed up to
hold down Wolf, star of Southern
California's offense. Mitchell, one
of the fastest breaking guards to be
developed at Stanford, played all
around his highly-touted rival.
Howcv(i, Weeden, Nottage, and
Tietien,% rapidly developing for->
wards, were unable to break
: through the tight Trojan defense.
Preparing for an invasion of
U.C.L.A. and U.S.C. pools this week
end. Stanford's water polo team will
be polishing up on its fast-breaking
offense in hupes of dunking either
one of their favored rivals.
With stress placed on shooting at
every opportunity, the Indians will
be drilling in the 20-yard pool to j
compensate for the use of shorter !
courses in the southern schools.
The Cards will undoubtedly en
ter the two-day tournament in the
underdog spot, b'Jt their potential !
strength, as evidenced by their j
showing last Saturday against the ;
Trojans, will not be overlooked by
either U.S.C. or U.C.L.A.
Stanford started what looked like |
an extremely bleak season w'th only j
two returning veterans. Captain j
Ted Moreno was outstanding last [
year as a guard, and Dave Nottage
saw action in several games. Mo
reno was the only man on the squad
with high school experience behind
him.
DEFENSE INTENSIVE
However, in a recent interview :
Coach Thornton said, "The manner i
in which the boys reached a peak !
in the U.S.C. game was very en
couraging. Holding the strong Tro
jans to a 4-2 score was an achieve

at the beginning of the season. Stan
