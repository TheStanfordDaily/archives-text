# Frosh Gridders Brush Up Weak Pass Defense
## 
### 
Trying to keep at the peak they
hit in their game against the
U.S.C. frosh last Saturday, the
Papoose gridders yesterday went
through a session of dummy pass
scrimmage with the first stringers
working on both offense and de
fense.
For the most part, the frosh pass
ing attack last Saturday was pretty
fnir, although it didn't click nearly
as well as it did in previous games
against easier opponents. Stanford's
pass defense, however, was weak as
shown by the goodly number of
passes Ihe Trobabes completed.
Both of the S. C. touchdowns were
made by the air route following
drives which featured passes as the
moat potent weapon of attack.
It was that weakness that Harry
Shipkey, frosh mentor, was trying
| to get rid of yesterday. For the Cal
| frosh, whom the Papooses play a
week from Saturday, are quite likely
to take advantage of such a glaring
! weakness.
And it's quite certain that those
Cubs will be well aware of any
weaknesses the frosh showed last
week-end, for Bob Herwig, Cali
fornia's freshman football coach and
! former All-American center, was
; in the press box scouting both of
i Stanford's football teams in action
against U.S.C.
Although the Papoose grid squad,
by virtue of their reputation, should
win their game against Chaffey
Junior College this Saturday, it is
quite likely that the junior college
! gridders may give Shipkey's boys a
1 tough afternoon of football. Un
| derdog teams have a way of doing
I that, i
