						Drive in Time

### 
EACH year Stanford's overcrowded activities
wheel spins with greater speed and Tess di
rection than before. Occasionally the brakes
are applied by an alert Ex Committee and the
whole machine is stopped for overhauling.
This year's job of oiling and repairing the
mechanics of student projects was dropped in
the lap of John Porter and his Drives Committee.
Meeting with a faculty group appointed by Dr.
Wilbur, the A.S.S.U. sub-committee mapped a
calendar of Farm events for the two and a half
quarters of this academic year.
Most of its recommendations were routine —
apportioning time to fund-gathering causes,
evaluating one project in relation to another,
and shuffling the whole matter into the Uni
versity's list of examinations —and holidays.
But when the student-faculty committee tack
led the Convalescent Home Drive it faced the
largest single extra-curricular item, one involv
ing nearly every Stanford man and woman.
Acting on unanimous suggestion of last year' 3
Ex Committee, the Drives Committee combined
Back to the Farm Week and the Home Drive.
And it recommended that it occur no later than
the fourth week in spring quarter.
This second proposal is a radical shift of
policy. It would definitely place the Drive at
the beginning instead of the middle or end of
spring. But such a plan is a sincere attempt to
solve a tough problem—that of declining profits
from the Home Drive.
As long as spring quarter and the actual furor
of committee activity is sufficiently far in the
future to discuss the matter clinically, Ex Com
mittee must realize that, as a money-maker, the
Drive has dropped in effectiveness for several
years.
After all, what good is a Convalescent Home
Drive if it doesn't make money? And, though
the off-campus soliciting has netted a higher
return each year, the other sections have been
steadily declining since the King and Queen
contest was abandoned.
Barbaric as it was, the King-Queen election—
and its Masque Ball—coined money for the
kiddies. Its bad features, however, outweighed
its good and the idea was scrapped.
But if Stanford, to revive flagging interest in
its most worthy charity, can inject new life into
the Home Drive by combining it with Back to
the Farm Week and by shoving it forward into
the first unmarred days of spring quarter, these
artificial means should be taken.
Another mildly successful Home Driye with
another drop in revenue would definitely put
the whole matter on the skids. Any steps that
can be taken to save the project by revamping
its spot in the social calendar should be taken—
and quickly.
To "pin one on for the kiddies" this year will
mean pinning the Convalescent Home Drive
on the first part of spring quarter.
