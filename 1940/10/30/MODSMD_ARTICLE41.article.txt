# Bellwether on Boos
## 
### 
BELLWETHER is hardly the sort who continu
ally whips himself into a froth. The sage
has no fluff-and-feathers in his makeup. To dash
around a corner and find this mental giant
haranguing three diminutive freshmen was a
distinct shock.
The oration stopped upon my arrival, prob
ably because of an inadvertent thwack on the
back that one of my elbows had administered
to the prophet. When he recovered Wis breath
it was the Bellwether of old who smiled down
his nose at the three palpitating frosh.
' Well, bye-bye, laddies," he boomed. "Think
it over."
The great one delicately brushed off the grass
stems and sat down. "Join me, boy." Then ac
cepting the proffered pack of cigarettes he lit
two and handed me one.
"Bellwether," I began, realizing that the cig
arettes were hardly worth mention, "none of
my business, I know, but what was going on?"
The great man nibbled at a blade of grass.
"Hated to see our boys and girls booing at last
Saturday's game. Bad idea. Doesn't go at all."
"I see. So you caught those three in the
middle of it all?"
The prophet sighed. "No, they were just the
object lesson." Then, noncommittally, "seemed
to apply at that."
The lengthy Bellwetherian bulk propped itself
upon bulbous elbows. "Laddie, what did you
think of the booing-section?"
"Well . . . Bellwether, it's like this . .
Stanford's sage nodded sadly. "Et tu, Brute?"
The situation was rapidly growing critical.
Emery," I hemmed, I was carried away by
the masses. Felt like a heel a moment after."
One Bellwether eye cocked in my direction.
Immaterial, laddie, how did you feel when the

S.C. stands didn't pick up the nasty habit? Kind
of rubbing coals over ashes or something,
wasn't it?"
"The Bellwether logic was effective even if
the metaphor wasn't. "Don't rub it in, Emery."
"How do you think it sounded over the radio,
laddie?"
"Cripes, Bellwether, they didn't do that!"
"Immaterial, they could have." Bellwether
rolled over and drew himself to his haunches.
"Never mind, son, we learn by experience. As
for me, I'm off to class." The long shape un
folded.
Curiosity could no longer be restrained.
"Bellwether!" I pleaded. "Didn't you join in
with just a wee little boo?"
"Immaterial, laddie. Picked up laryngitis last
week and couldn't even whisper."—W. C.

"Cripes, Bellwether, they didn't do that!"
"Immaterial, they could have." Bellwether
rolled over and drew himself to his haunches.
"Never mind, son, we learn by experience. As
for me, I'm off to class." The long shape un
folded.
Curiosity could no longer be restrained.
"Bellwether!" I pleaded. "Didn't you join in
with just a wee little boo?"
"Immaterial, laddie. Picked up laryngitis last
week and couldn't even whisper."—W. C.
BELLWETHER is hardly the sort who continu
ally whips himself into a froth. The sage
has no fluff-and-feathers in his makeup. To dash
around a corner and find this mental giant
haranguing three diminutive freshmen was a
distinct shock.
The oration stopped upon my arrival, prob
ably because of an inadvertent thwack on the
back that one of my elbows had administered
to the prophet. When he recovered Wis breath
it was the Bellwether of old who smiled down
his nose at the three palpitating frosh.
' Well, bye-bye, laddies," he boomed. "Think
it over."
The great one delicately brushed off the grass
stems and sat down. "Join me, boy." Then ac
cepting the proffered pack of cigarettes he lit
two and handed me one.
"Bellwether," I began, realizing that the cig
arettes were hardly worth mention, "none of
my business, I know, but what was going on?"
The great man nibbled at a blade of grass.
"Hated to see our boys and girls booing at last
Saturday's game. Bad idea. Doesn't go at all."
"I see. So you caught those three in the
middle of it all?"
The prophet sighed. "No, they were just the
object lesson." Then, noncommittally, "seemed
to apply at that."
The lengthy Bellwetherian bulk propped itself
upon bulbous elbows. "Laddie, what did you
think of the booing-section?"
"Well . . . Bellwether, it's like this . .
Stanford's sage nodded sadly. "Et tu, Brute?"
The situation was rapidly growing critical.
Emery," I hemmed, I was carried away by
the masses. Felt like a heel a moment after."
One Bellwether eye cocked in my direction.
Immaterial, laddie, how did you feel when the

S.C. stands didn't pick up the nasty habit? Kind
of rubbing coals over ashes or something,
wasn't it?"
"The Bellwether logic was effective even if
the metaphor wasn't. "Don't rub it in, Emery."
"How do you think it sounded over the radio,
laddie?"
"Cripes, Bellwether, they didn't do that!"
"Immaterial, they could have." Bellwether
rolled over and drew himself to his haunches.
