### BUD AMES 
DID YOU FEEL THE DRAFT?
YESTERDAY the government played a nifty lot
tery game in which every one of the lucky, lucky
contestants got a prize. "Hey, hey, step up gents, and
take your pick. There's a winner every time. You
can't lose."
Only the government could work out this glorified
"shell game" in such a way that every one of the
16,400,000 contestants was a winner. A sandwich in
every capsule.
Probably most of you missed the frolic at the
big drawing yesterday morning because you were in
9 o'clock classes. So for your belated information—
the whole thing started off with a mushy-voiced an
nouncer breathing reverently into a microphone all
about how Henry L. Stimson, Secretary of War, was
blindfolded and how he was going to draw the first
numbered capsule out of the beer mug.
"Mr. Stimson is stepping to the bowl. He reaches
in, and grasps a capsule, and in a moment you will
hear the first number."
There was a sound of scuffling, and the next voice
turned out to be that of President Roosevelt. As nifty
a job of upstaging as you could want. Well, anyway,
Mr. Stimson got to draw the number, didn't he?

I
«l\flAA freens...the furst seeraal nomba is one-fiva,
ITA eight."
Somewhere in the crowd behind Roosevelt a woman
screamed. Just like vaudeville. Immediately she was
strong-armed to the microphone for an interview. It
is still a question whether she was laughing from joy
or whether it was just plain, down-to-earth hyster
ical gibbering.
Anyway, it seems that she has a son who helps a
plumbing contractor which makes him as certain of
getting tossed into the army as one Siamese twin is
of the other.
Then in an oily voice which would have made
Simon Legree sound like Roosevelt addressing the
Stanford Republican Club, Secretary of War Stimson
breathed a quote which would chill even a Good
humor Man.
"I'm sure, Mrs , that your boy will spend a
pleasant year in the army. Heh, heh. heh."
You could just see him pulling away at his long
black mustache.

jgUT here is an encouraging note which came out
of yesterday's proceedings. We have it. on strict
est authority from a potentate who is the guiding
fist on one of the local draft boards that Stanford
students have very little to fear. He doesn't believe
that the board will do much about dragging you stu
dents out of school even if your number should be
called. Which it probably will.

By the way, Jimmy Stewart of "Holly-would
you?" infamy held the first draft number called, num
ber 158, and that's no fooling. Doesn't your heart just
go pitty-pat. Just think of cleaning out all those army
stables—next to Jimmy Stewart!
