## GUISEPPI GREEN 
### 
r Â£' , HE EDITOR, SIR:
I would suggest that Bill Moran look in an
Italian-English dictionary in the names section under
Guiseppe and then under Verdi. I think that he
didn't look far enough or in the right places and
when defeat overtook him the third time he should
have changed his tactics and used his head. If he
had, he would have seen that the writer of "Thumbs
Up" was jokingly translating Italian into English.
When Bill Moran looks into the aforementioned dic
tionary he will find that Guiseppi Verdi is the Italian
for Joseph Green.
Sincerely yours,
Howard Weller
