EDITOR, SIR:
In the debate which has raged over Rallycom's
slogans there has been one most pertinent factor over
looked. This factor is peculiar to election years (we
must keep abreast of the times).
Rallycom's noxious little plasters have the fortu
uate property of covering up the even more noxious
campaign propaganda of the "Vote for St. Franklin"
and "No Fourth or Fifth Term Either" variety.
Vote for Thomas.
And—
