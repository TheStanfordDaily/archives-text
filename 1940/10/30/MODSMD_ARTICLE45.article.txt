# LET'S INCREASE THE RATIO

### 
r EDITOR, SIR:
This is one of the best universities on the Pa
cific Coast. Its campus is set in the rolling foothills
of the Coast Range; when the evening mists drift in, it
is beautiful. The people are charming, though per
haps their insincerity is their greatest fault. There
are enough books in the libe to furnish reading mate
rial for any serious student.
But Stanford's primary advantage, from my point
of view, is not its dreamy landscape or educational
facilities. I am a woman. Admittedly I came here
to find a man to marry, while I buffed the rough
edges off my personality. The draft will take the
men away. I might be facetious and say that if
enough men disappear, I will go to the University of
Alaska where the ratio is 27 to 1, but that is an im
possibility.
I am sure there are other women at Stanford in my
position. Perhaps they too will say that Stanford will
lose its main talking point when the men disappear.
As a consequence of this shortage, I suggest that the
number of women at Stanford be reduced to keep
pace with that of the men. Competition must be kept
equal. Surely a place can be found in the current
defense scheme for the women. If not, Roosevelt might
be willing to put in a few places, if for nothing else
but the votes.
Sincerely,
Farmerette
