# Fast Dialogue Features New Anti-War Film

### 
"Foreign Correspondent." Well
worth the time and money no
matter how far you have to go
to see it.
With the tempo set by some very
fast dialogue concocted by James
Hilton and the inimitable Robert
Benchley, this film takes the au
dience through a series of scrapes
and narrow escapes designed to
leave them limp at the end of two
hours. '
It could easily have been merely
a highly entertaining adventure
stoxy, but in the hands of Director
Alfred Hitchcock, England's "mas
ter of suspense," it is one of the
most subtle and effective pieces of
anti-war propaganda ever to come !
out of Hollywood.
EVE OF WAR
The story is that of Johnny John- j
ston, a young American newspaper j
man, who goes to Europe on the eve |
of the war for his first assignment j
as a foreign correspondent. He is to j
cover the conference of an inter- |
national peace organization headed [
by a certain Stephen Fisher which I
is striving apparently to avert war. |
While carrying out this seemingly |
simple assignment, Johnny stumbles j
on a fake assassination, a kidnap
ing, and a whole ring of spies head
ed by the same Mr. Fisher. Com
plications set in when Johnny falls
in love with Fisher's daughter Carol,
who knows nothing about her fa
ther's activities.
McCREA EXCELLENT
Joel McCrea as Johnny is excel
lent in his most winning, tweedy,
American-charm manner. Herbert
Marshall as the smooth Mr. Fisher,
Albeit Basserman as Holland's tired
old "Iron Man" Van Meer, and
George Sanders as ffolliott (remem
ber him as Favelle in "Rebecca"?)
are all splendid. Of Laraine Day
(Dr. Kildare's Nurse Lamont) one
might say she was adequate. Rob
ert , Benchley as the London Cor
respondent for Johnny's newspaper I
steals the show. • j
You can almost tell who wrote j
which lines. Typical Benchley is
where Johnny clad only in a bath
robe is discovered in Carol's bath
room. She tells him she would like
him better dressed. Says Johnny,
"Oh, you like the intellectual type,
eh?"
Typical Hilton is the last speech
given by Johnny from a London
radio studio during an air raid. If
that doesn't finish you off com
pletely, better ask for your money
back.—Fisher

out of Hollywood.
EVE OF WAR
The story is that of Johnny John- j
ston, a young American newspaper j
man, who goes to Europe on the eve |
of the war for his first assignment j
as a foreign correspondent. He is to j
cover the conference of an inter- |
national peace organization headed [
by a certain Stephen Fisher which I
is striving apparently to avert war. |
While carrying out this seemingly |
simple assignment, Johnny stumbles j
on a fake assassination, a kidnap
ing, and a whole ring of spies head
ed by the same Mr. Fisher. Com
plications set in when Johnny falls
in love with Fisher's daughter Carol,
who knows nothing about her fa
ther's activities.
McCREA EXCELLENT
Joel McCrea as Johnny is excel
lent in his most winning, tweedy,
American-charm manner. Herbert
Marshall as the smooth Mr. Fisher,
Albeit Basserman as Holland's tired
old "Iron Man" Van Meer, and
George Sanders as ffolliott (remem
ber him as Favelle in "Rebecca"?)
are all splendid. Of Laraine Day
(Dr. Kildare's Nurse Lamont) one
might say she was adequate. Rob
ert , Benchley as the London Cor
respondent for Johnny's newspaper I
steals the show. • j
You can almost tell who wrote j
which lines. Typical Benchley is
where Johnny clad only in a bath
robe is discovered in Carol's bath
room. She tells him she would like
him better dressed. Says Johnny,
"Oh, you like the intellectual type,
eh?"
Typical Hilton is the last speech
given by Johnny from a London
radio studio during an air raid. If
that doesn't finish you off com
pletely, better ask for your money
back.—Fisher
"Foreign Correspondent." Well
worth the time and money no
matter how far you have to go
to see it.
With the tempo set by some very
fast dialogue concocted by James
Hilton and the inimitable Robert
Benchley, this film takes the au
dience through a series of scrapes
and narrow escapes designed to
leave them limp at the end of two
hours. '
It could easily have been merely
a highly entertaining adventure
stoxy, but in the hands of Director
Alfred Hitchcock, England's "mas
ter of suspense," it is one of the
most subtle and effective pieces of
anti-war propaganda ever to come !
