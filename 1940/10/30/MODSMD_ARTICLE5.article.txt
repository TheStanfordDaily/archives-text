# Excom Cancels Projected Talk By van Paassen
## A.S.S.U. President, Manager to Approve Concert Appointee 
### M. J. MONTGOMERY 
While there was a quorum pres
ent last night at Ex Committee's
longest and least conclusive meeting
of the quarter, the appointment of
a World Affairs Day chairman was
postponed, action was tabled on
Cardinals charter revision, and last
week's decision to present a lecture
by Pierre van Paassen Feb. 20 was
rescinded.
Cancellation of the lecture arose
because it was scheduled the week
the Public Exercises Committee
presents Vilhjalmur Stefansson, the
world famous author, explorer and
scientist, who spoke at Stanford in
1938 on "Transpolar Commerce by
Air."
BIG GAME BONFIRE: On Ross
Anderson's recommendation Cardi
nals appointments for the bonfire
committee were rejected, since ap
pointees included students on schol
astic probation and the Row-Hall
distribution was uneven.
CONCERT SERIES: The concert
manager's absolute power in the ap
pointment of his successor was mod
ified by Excom's action to extend
control of the manager's selection to
the approval of Ex Committee. Dick
Stepp recommended this chiefly
because the A.S.S.U. underwrites
the Concert Series, and is therefore
directly responsible.
DRIVES COMMITTEE: If John
Porter's proposed calendar is exe
cuted, the County Fair, Y.W.C.A.
finance drive, Family Call, the
March of Dimes will be scheduled
Winter Quarter, and the Senior and
Alumni and Convalescent Home
drives held Spring Quarter.
The "Y's" request to collect books
for Chinese students was referred
to the Drives Committee.
RED CROSS DRIVE: Appoint
ments for drive heads in various
living groups, made by Rosamond
Upson, chairman, were approved.
They will be published next week.
