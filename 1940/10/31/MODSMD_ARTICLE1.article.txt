activities have
been going on in Greece as they
did in other European countries
prior to invasion—if any truth can
be attached to two reports coming
from abroad last night.
From Rome came the report that
allegedly. pro-Fascist Prince Paul
was arrested by the government to
.spike fifth-column activities in
Greece.
The other report coming from Bel
grade suggested that Italy and
Greece were about to come to terms
through the help of fifth column
government factions in Greece.
Whatever the truth in these re
ports, it is at least possible that the
Axis has here attempted its usual
policy of either dislodging or throw
ing into confusion the existing pro-
British government of the country
to be invaded. To date, this policy
has been conspicuously effective.
Governments have been confused in
Austria, Poland, Norway, Belgium,
Holland, and France; and the gov
ernment of Rumania was finally dis
lodged.

/""ERTAINLY Nazi and Fascist
agents have been placed in ev
ery country of the world. Some
fifth-column instigated groups are
well known. In France there was
the "Croix de Feu" and in Rumania
there was the "Iron Guard." In the
United States there is the German-
American Bund and in Great Brit
ain there was the Fascist Union.
Each one of these organizations op
erated for a long time legally, ac
cording to the laws of the particular
country in which it existed.
In France high figures in the
government were, if not actually
members of the legal Fascist
group, sympathizers with the
group and undoubtedly acted in
accordance with its policies
even when these policies conflicted
directly with the policies of the
government which they were sup
posedly representing. Pierre La
val is only the most publicized
French politician to do this.
In Greece the Nazi-Fascist line of
attack was quite probably little dif
ferent than it was in these other
countries. Prince Paul possibly
drew support directly from the Axis
abroad to create a revolutionary sit
uation which would give him the
opportunity of seizing the throne or
to urge the ministers of the pro-
British government to support ac
tively the pro-Axis policy.
The creation of a revolutionary
situation would weaken the gov
ernment's resistance to actual in
vasion or even prevent the gov
ernment from functioning. The
placing of pro-Axis Prince Paul
on the throne would bring Greece
into the Axis camp without the
necessity of a struggle.

certain elements of the
Greek population have been of
fended by the extremely British at
titude of King George 11, the devel
opment of a hostile, anti-govern
ment opposition has been made eas
ier. This group would be anti-Brit
ish and pro-Axis simply because it
disliked a king who seemed to them
to be more British than Greek.
If the British cannot show more
definite military aid to Greece im
mediately, this pro-Axis group will
find many new supporters and less
internal opposition.
In addition, Greece's neutral
neighbors—Bulgaria and Yugoslavia
—are undoubtedly bringing pressure
on Greece to submit to Axis de
mands and erect a pro-Axis gov
ernment.
These factors may be of sufficient
weight to bring about an agreement
between Italy and Greece and the
placement of Prince Paul on the
Greek throne, if the present gov
ernment does not dispose of him
beforehand.
