# PIPERS SKIRL, LEAVE FOR MR. BURNS
## Officer Forbids Unique Concert 
### JAN GOULD 
The Campbells were coming over
the women's hockey field the other
Monday night, escorted by Dick
Laidlaw of Branner and ' Nick" Car
ter of Encina, when Officer George
Burns came along.
"Those bagpipes," Mr. Burns said.
"I think you'd better take them
away to the country. You might go
play near Manglni's."
So ended a request program of
Scottish marches and dirges for a
small and select audience gathered
near the swimming pool, uninter
rupted except for occasional cries
from Lagunita and Roble across the
way, and taken at the time by the
pipers to be complimentary. Not
that Carter and Laidlaw were upset
by being evicted: there are people,
they know, who are not in tune with
the pipes; and short of Carter's re
marking during the course of com
plaints ' Who's the woman with the
deep male voice?" they were stoical.
Although both are of Scottish de
scent, and sport their clan tartans
on their instruments, they learned

to pipe in Dallas and in Oakland.
Laidlaw first picked up some un
used bagpipes five years ago at
Highland Park High School in Tex
as, and learned his tunes and fin
gering without any instruction and
minus a "chanter," the small prac
tice pipe. For three years, he an
nounced, he never talked to an
other enthusiast.
"I didn't know to put honey in
my bag," he continued. "Sure. It
keeps it airtight—eight-cent honey
is what I use, too.
"I have the best pair of lungs in
Dallas," he said after a minute. "I
learned the hard way."
SCHOOL IN SCOTLAND
"Nick" Carter picked up the
pipes under the instruction of Brick
Johnson coach of the pipe band of
Piedmont High School in Oakland,
five years ago. His first interest had
been aroused during his school ex
perience at Delhousie Castle, out
side Edinburgh, and his attending
the Northern Meetings and the Al
dershot and other tattoos.
SOMEWHERE OR SOMETIME
"Fellow named Laidlaw," his
namesake said, "was the first cas
ualty of something or other."
"They're all brave," Carter said.
"At least to hear Fred McLellan,
champion piper of California, tell
about it.
And then they piped. Striding the
traditional 105 paces a minute, they
marched up and down the wet grass
of the field, or stood facing each
other, frowning and taking the time
with their heel. In duet they played
the famous "Lord Lovat's Lament,"
one of the best - known funeral
marches. They played the "Barren
Rocks of Aden," and Carter said:
"Did you ever notice that when
Sabu or Cary Grant is in trouble
in one of those empire pictures, the
Scotties always come to that tune?
Or 'Highland Laddie' sometimes."
Pacing side by side they skirled
down the field to "79th's Farewell to
Gibraltar"; Carter played a welcome
to the 43rd Northern Meetings, and
Laidlaw countered with "Cock o'
the North," and they joined again
with "MacPherson's Lament and
Farewell" and "Over the Road to
Skye."

the famous "Lord Lovat's Lament,"
one of the best - known funeral
marches. They played the "Barren
Rocks of Aden," and Carter said:
"Did you ever notice that when
Sabu or Cary Grant is in trouble
in one of those empire pictures, the
Scotties always come to that tune?
Or 'Highland Laddie' sometimes."
Pacing side by side they skirled
down the field to "79th's Farewell to
Gibraltar"; Carter played a welcome
to the 43rd Northern Meetings, and
Laidlaw countered with "Cock o'
the North," and they joined again
with "MacPherson's Lament and
Farewell" and "Over the Road to
Skye."
The Campbells were coming over
the women's hockey field the other
Monday night, escorted by Dick
Laidlaw of Branner and ' Nick" Car
ter of Encina, when Officer George
Burns came along.
"Those bagpipes," Mr. Burns said.
"I think you'd better take them
away to the country. You might go
play near Manglni's."
So ended a request program of
Scottish marches and dirges for a
small and select audience gathered
near the swimming pool, uninter
rupted except for occasional cries
from Lagunita and Roble across the
way, and taken at the time by the
pipers to be complimentary. Not
that Carter and Laidlaw were upset
by being evicted: there are people,
they know, who are not in tune with
the pipes; and short of Carter's re
marking during the course of com
plaints ' Who's the woman with the
deep male voice?" they were stoical.
Although both are of Scottish de
scent, and sport their clan tartans
on their instruments, they learned

to pipe in Dallas and in Oakland.
Laidlaw first picked up some un
used bagpipes five years ago at
Highland Park High School in Tex
as, and learned his tunes and fin
gering without any instruction and
minus a "chanter," the small prac
tice pipe. For three years, he an
nounced, he never talked to an
other enthusiast.
"I didn't know to put honey in
my bag," he continued. "Sure. It
keeps it airtight—eight-cent honey
is what I use, too.
"I have the best pair of lungs in
Dallas," he said after a minute. "I
learned the hard way."
SCHOOL IN SCOTLAND
"Nick" Carter picked up the
pipes under the instruction of Brick
Johnson coach of the pipe band of
Piedmont High School in Oakland,
five years ago. His first interest had
been aroused during his school ex
perience at Delhousie Castle, out
side Edinburgh, and his attending
the Northern Meetings and the Al
dershot and other tattoos.
SOMEWHERE OR SOMETIME
"Fellow named Laidlaw," his
namesake said, "was the first cas
ualty of something or other."
"They're all brave," Carter said.
"At least to hear Fred McLellan,
champion piper of California, tell
about it.
And then they piped. Striding the
traditional 105 paces a minute, they
marched up and down the wet grass
of the field, or stood facing each
other, frowning and taking the time
with their heel. In duet they played
the famous "Lord Lovat's Lament,"
one of the best - known funeral
marches. They played the "Barren
