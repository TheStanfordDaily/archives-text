# Farm Holds Straw Vote Today; Forum Discusses Presidential Aspirants
## Audience Boos, Cheers Favorites In Hot Debate 
### 
The Stanford Forum took its how
last night in a storm of controversy.
And national polities slipped into
Memorial Hall at 7:.'10 o'clock when ,
eight speakers, representing campus
Democratic and Republican organi
zations, argued the merits of their
presidential nominees.
The audience of 200 that cheered,
booed and shouted during the hour
and a half long meeting kept A. S.
S. U. President Bruce Jessup, mod
erator of the discussion, busy pre
serving order. And, at the end of
the formal speeches and rebuttals,
questions popped from every corner
of the house.
AUDIENCE PRO-WILLKIE
Heavily pro-Willkie, the audience
directed most queries at the Demo
cratic representatives â€” Bob Low,
Bob Beckham, Sylvia Berry, and I
Bob Newell.
Advocating the election of the He
publican nominee were Joe Morin,
Jim Kessler, Barney Gill, and Den
nis Green. Three speakers from
each organization presented five
minute constructive arguments. J
Newell and Green were allowed ten- I
minute refutation periods.
Morin opened the Republican case I
by speaking of the personal quali- !
fications of Willkie as "a liberal and 1
man of the people who worked in
I the hay fields to earn the money for
a college education."
BECKHAM CONSIDERS NY A
Bob Beckham considered the ben
eficial aspects of New Deal youth
legislation such as the CCC and
NYA. He further evalualed the so
cial legislation of the Administration
and challenged Americans to oppose
its purposes and still "call them
selves liberal."
The dangers of a third term occu
pied the attention of Barney Gill,
who referred to President Roosevelt
as "the voice."
Bob Low considered the practical
political aspects of the Administra
tion and the President's ability as a
political leader to maneuver legis
lation through both houses of Con
gress. He declared that "Willkie is
no party leader. He is even at var
iance with Mr. McNary on basic
campaign issues and the record
shows that he disagrees with promi
nent Republican Senator's and Con
gressmen."
Jim Kessler spoke on the NRA,
the WPA, and the national debt.
Sylvia Berry, replying to Republican
advocates with a rapid, machine
gun delivery that piled fact after
fact against the Willkie record, af
firmed that TVA and NLRB, both
agencies which the Republican
would be called upon to continue as
President, had brought action against
the utilities company which Willkie
had headed.
