REPUBLICAN STRONGHOLD
Stanford has proved to be a Re
publican bulwark in the five straw
votes held in the past. Only excep
tion was the first election in 1912,
when Wilson defeated Taft and
Roosevelt. No student straw votes
were held in 1916 or 1920.
In 1924, however, Stanford stu
dents favored Coolidge over La-
Follette and Davis, and in 1928
Hoover took the campus by a land
slide, as he did in 1932, trouncing
Roosevelt and Thomas. In 1936 Lon
don was named over Roosevelt.
This election is jointly sponsored
by The Stanford Daily and Pi Sigma
Alpha national political science fra
ternity, and Stanford Republican
and Democratic groups. Dwight
Hutchinson and Donald Crawford
are co-chairmen.

REPUBLICAN STRONGHOLD
Stanford has proved to be a Re
publican bulwark in the five straw
votes held in the past. Only excep
tion was the first election in 1912,
when Wilson defeated Taft and
Roosevelt. No student straw votes
were held in 1916 or 1920.
In 1924, however, Stanford stu
dents favored Coolidge over La-
Follette and Davis, and in 1928
Hoover took the campus by a land

Roosevelt and Thomas. In 1936 Lon
