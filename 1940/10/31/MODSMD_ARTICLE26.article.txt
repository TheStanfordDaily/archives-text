### 
For the first time aince September, 1939, the wars in Europe and Asia are being shifted to positions
ol secondary importance in the news and picture columns of the nation's newspapers. The reason
loi iLis is t!i<- American presidential campaign—now entering its final and most hectic week. The
pictures below arc but a lew oi the scores of campaign pictures that have been received from oho
tographic services by The Daily in the past two weeks.


THE CHALLENGER. . .Few "fighting" pictures of Wendell L.
Willkie have been taken, mostly because he refuses to strike
"poses" for photographers. In this scene, however, Mr.
Willkie is good and mad. Reason: one nicely-placed egg,
thrown by a Chicago WPA worker, which hit the Repub
lican nominee squarely.


RAIN DIDN'T £10? a large crowd from turning out to hear the Republican nominee at New
York. This speech marked the end of a long campaign tour through the entire West.


MO3T ACTIVE campaigner in the Democratic party has
been vice-presidential nominee Henry A. Wallace, former
secretary of agriculture in Mr. Roosevelt's cabinet. Above,
he addresses a crowd at Oakland, Calif.


THE CHAMPION. . .In his first admittedly political speech
of the campaign, President Roosevelt struck at the "falsifi
cations of his opponents before a Philadelphia audience.


BITTER OPPONENT of many
of Mr. Roosevelt's foreign and
domestic policies in the last
seven years, Missouri's Sena
tor Bennett Champ Clark nev
ertheless came out for the
President's re-election last
week.


HAILED BY REPUBLICANS was the powerful denunciation
of the third term by California's Senator Hiram W. Johnson.
Admitting he did not agree with Willkie and McNary on
all issues, the veteran isolationist nevertheless said that the
third term was the "foremost issue in thp camnaion "
