# 'Board of Strategy Polishes Defense Against Robinson
## 
### 
Running right on a planned schedule in preparation for their fourth
conference game with U.C.L.A.. Coach Clark Shaughnessy's Indians pol
ished oil their pass offense yesterday and turned their attention to stop
ping the Bruin offense in general and Jackie Robinson in particular.
A reserve eleven under the direction c;f head scout Husky Hunt
impersonated the Bruins from Westwood in yesterday's defense practice,
and Shaughnessy and his other as- A

sistants, Jim Lawson, Phil Bengt
son, and Marchie Schwartz, started
teaching their first and second
stringers the defense the board of
strategy has already figured out on
paper.
IN THE DARK
The Card coaching staff is a little
in the dark as to whether the Bruins'
flashy Robinson will perform at that
key left halfback spot which is so
vacant because of the graduation of
the great Kenny Washington, or
whether he, having failed to gain
much yardage this year except on
punt returns, will move back to his
favorite right halfback position.
If Robinson goes back to right
half and uses again his natural
speed on reverses around the flanks
instead of his still lacking straight
ahead power, Ted Forbes will take
over the first string left half post.
Leo Cantor at fullback and Ned
Mathews at quarterback will round
out Coach Babe Horrell's backfield.
NORBERG OUT
A couple of other Bruin backfield
men who are sure to action against
the Cardinal are Ray Bartlett, a
rangy negro who played end last
year, and Leon Brown, who along
with Bartlett plays right halfback.
Hank "the Hard Luck Kid" Nor
berg is on the sidelines again. This
time it is a broken bone in his foot;
yesterday X-rays confirmed what
the doctors suspected Tuesday night.
Ray Hammett, who was hurt ihe
same time Norberg was, was back in
a uniform yesterday and will go
south.
Coach Clark Shaughnessy is send
ing his gridmen south in shifts this
week-end for the Bruin tussle. A
greater part of the squad, 40 men,
will shove off this afternoon in order
to get in Los Angeles in time to
work out on the Coliseum Field.
