# Greek Truce Looms if Aid Not Hurried
## Balkan Rumors Claim Grecian King Will Be Forced to Quit Throne 
### United Press 
Unless Great Britain makes some
sort of an effective show of aid in
defense of Greece within a day or
two the Greeks may give up and
come to terms with Benito Musso
lini on his own conditions, Balkan
dispatches implied Wednesday
night.
The reports of an impending
"deal" between Rome and Athens
to end the three-day-old conflict
may well be Axis propaganda in
tended to disrupt Greek morale, but
it seemed evident that strong pres
sure was being exerted on Greece
by Germany and Italy, perhaps aided
by Greece's still-neutral neighbors.
EXPLANATION
The explanation for this may well
lie in the fact that Britain's land
forces in the Near Eastern theater of
war are woefully small and that
every man is needed for defense of
Alexandria and the Suez Canal and
the rich British oil fields of Iran
and Iraq. Likewise Bi-itish strength
in the air is far inferior to that of
Italy in the eastern Mediterranean.
The British admiralty in London
announced British warships from
eastern Mediterranean bases were
actively aiding Greece, however,
and have mined strategic western
and southern ocastal waters to pro
tect ancient Athens from naval as
sault.
NEGOTIATIONS UNDER WAY
Rome hinted undcr-cover nego
tiations already are under way with
"fifth columnists" among the
Greeks and pro-Axis Crown Prince
Paul of Greece may be thrust upon
the throne in the familiar Axis man
ner to turn the nation over to Italian
military and naval occupation.
King George 11, whose British
sympathies have been subject to
complaint even among his own peo
ple in the past, then would be driv
en into British exile for the second
time in 16 years.
