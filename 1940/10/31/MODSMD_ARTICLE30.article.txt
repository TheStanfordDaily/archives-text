# Shipkey Makes Frosh Gridders Pass-Conscious
## System Gives Team Plenty of Work But No Injury Dangers 
### 
Pass drill was again the order of
the day on the frosh practice field
yesterday as Coach Harry Shipkey
sent his gridders through a long
workout that terminated only when
darkness enveloped the field.
Shipkey has quite a novel system
of making his boys pass-conscious.
They have a regular game scrim
mage with two exceptions: (1)
there can be only one running play
in each series of four downs, and
(2) instead of being tackled, the
ball carrier is stopped by being
tagged with two hands.
PLENTY OF WORK
Thus the teams get plenty of work
on passes, and there is no danger of
backs being injured through hard
tackles.
On the tossing end of most of the
first string's passes were Bob
Mitchell and Bob Koch, while little
Lee Scott did most of the flinging
for the seconds.
Absent for most of the workout
was Loren LaPrade, who was ex
cused early in order that he might
put some heat on his injured leg. It
is quite certain, however, that the
injury, a shin splint, will not keep
the Papoose's defensive ace from
seeing action against Chaffey J. C.
Saturday.
Because he doesn't think that his
charges know their assignments
well enough, Coach Shipkey plans
to put the Papoose squad through a
hard session on offense, with the
boys running through their entire
repertoire of plays.
THIRDS NEED WORK
"The first two outfits know their
stuff fairly well," the frosh mentor
declared, "but the thirds certainly
can use a lot of work." ,
The frosh are not only working to
get ready for their game against
Chaffey this Saturday but also for
their clash the following week-end
when they journey to Memorial
Stadium at Berkeley for their an
nual crack at the Cal Cubs,
