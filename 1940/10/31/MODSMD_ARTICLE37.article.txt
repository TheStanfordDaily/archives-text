### JERRY BRUCKER 
REPORT from operative 448
down in the glamor section of
the state flew in by carrier pigeon
this morning.
The package contained two collar
buttons, a box of shredded wheat,
and a letter. The letter read as
follows:
"Dear Jerryk (must be a typograph
ical error):
"Warn Coach Sbaughnessy &
Co. t<» prepare for a rough week
end. Even Graunian's Chinese is
plastered with 'Beat Stanford'
stickers. Rumors of dissension on
Briun team is subversive propa
ganda. Central Avenue stooge re
ports Jackie Robinson intends to
score two touchdowns personally.
"The Ucla team is ready to do or
die for Jimmy Lunceford. What
ever happens, don't give away points
on the game. Bruin line is very
tough defensively. Witness the fact
that no team has; scored more than
one touchdown against them this
year.
Yours, 448"

to Don Glendort, sports
writer of the San Francisco
News.
In your column Tuesday, Oct.
29, you said that the Stanford
rooting section pulled a card trick
between halves of the U.S.C. game
that had "cheap political signifi
cance."
I presume you referred to the
"No Third Term" stunt. That was
the third part of a series stunt. The
first two parts read, "Rose Bowl,
For Troy."
Rally Committee may not be too
sharp in some aspects, but if you
can find any "cheap political sig
nificance" in that stunt you're wel
come to it. Personally, I thought it
was sorta funny.
♦ * *
With that off our chest, we'll now
turn around and spank the Stanford
rooting section.
Football officials are not trying
to rob anyone. They get paid no
matter who wins. It's their job to
call the rule infractions as they
see them. Perhaps they occasion
ally sec them wrong; usually it is
the person in the stands whose
vision is faulty.
That pass interference penalty
called by Field Judge George Hicks
in the stadium last Saturday may
or may not have been justified.
However, the raspberry that greeted
the decision was entirely out of
place.
The team took the decision in
stride as one of the breaks of the
game, the rooting section should
have done the same.
The boos from the stands are
standard equipment in professional

1 baseball games or over in Berke
ley at the basketball games, but
net in Stanford Stadium.

COUPLE of new intramural
1 1 sports have been added to the
i campus picture.
An intramural bo\vling league is
j being organized along the lines of
j one last year. Organizations can
j enter a five-man team, each entry
j pays for his own lines. Regular
rates prevail.
No intramural credit is given for
this sport, but the game's popu
larity has brought out a large
entry list and should furnish some
\ gocd competition.
Coach Pitch Johnson advanced
, the idea of an Irish relay for intra
murals. The relay consists of a 16-
i man iour-mile race. Each man runs
! a 440. The event would not be run
on the track, but over a cross-
I country course around the campus.
If enough organizations can be in
terested to warrant a trial, the race
may become a regular part of the
j. fall intramural program.

In your column Tuesday, Oct.
29, you said that the Stanford
rooting section pulled a card trick
between halves of the U.S.C. game
that had "cheap political signifi
cance."
I presume you referred to the
"No Third Term" stunt. That was
the third part of a series stunt. The
first two parts read, "Rose Bowl,
For Troy."
Rally Committee may not be too
sharp in some aspects, but if you
can find any "cheap political sig
nificance" in that stunt you're wel
come to it. Personally, I thought it
was sorta funny.

With that off our chest, we'll now
turn around and spank the Stanford
rooting section.
Football officials are not trying
to rob anyone. They get paid no
matter who wins. It's their job to
call the rule infractions as they
see them. Perhaps they occasion
ally sec them wrong; usually it is
the person in the stands whose
vision is faulty.
That pass interference penalty
called by Field Judge George Hicks
in the stadium last Saturday may
or may not have been justified.
However, the raspberry that greeted
the decision was entirely out of
place.
The team took the decision in
stride as one of the breaks of the
game, the rooting section should
have done the same.
The boos from the stands are

COUPLE of new intramural
1 1 sports have been added to the
i campus picture.
An intramural bo\vling league is
j being organized along the lines of
j one last year. Organizations can
j enter a five-man team, each entry
j pays for his own lines. Regular
rates prevail.
No intramural credit is given for
this sport, but the game's popu
larity has brought out a large
entry list and should furnish some
\ gocd competition.
Coach Pitch Johnson advanced
, the idea of an Irish relay for intra
murals. The relay consists of a 16-
i man iour-mile race. Each man runs
! a 440. The event would not be run
on the track, but over a cross-
I country course around the campus.
If enough organizations can be in
terested to warrant a trial, the race
may become a regular part of the
j. fall intramural program.
REPORT from operative 448
