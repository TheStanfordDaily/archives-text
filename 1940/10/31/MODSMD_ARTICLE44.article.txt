THAT Stanford women are paragons of virtue
we cannot deny. From the woolen underwear
of New England to the scanty bathing suits of
California, the charm and grace of Stanford
womanhood is a known fact.
No more does that noxious old maxim apply:
"Four out of five women are good-looking—and
the fifth goes to Stanford."
That was an unfair statement to make about
the Farmerettes, however. There was no statis
tical substantiation for any such claim. Stan
ford's cuties had every reason to complain that
they were being condemned by a sweeping gen
eralization that had never been proved. Perhaps
they were lucky that no proof was forthcoming.
They were probably lucky as hell. Figures
might have proved the contention true . . . may
be a statistical analysis of the situation might
have been worse than the old bromide.
But those days are gone forever. All Stanford
women are now gueens. From the remotest cor
ner of the cactus gardens to the lonely light that
burns on a Saturday night in Lagunita, they are
beautiful.
But do they have the reguisites to be good
housewives? Anyone knows that 99 per cent
of local womanhood is looking for a mate. Most
Stanford men are so overwhelmed by the con
summate beauty of our coeds that they no longer
look for beauty alone in choosing a wife. Be
sides the traditional Stanford poise, they must
have something on the domestic ball . . . they
must be able to possess as many household
graces as they do social graces.
And how does the curriculum afford them an
opportunity to learn these valuable husband
getting tricks? The answer is that the school
has one (1) course in domestic sciences. In
other words, the Administration is trying to
marry Stanford men off to women ungualified
for the duties of a housewife.
In these times of domestic strife, every able
bodied man is thinking of getting married and
then retiring to the mountains of Montana to
get away from it all (and the draft).
And it's tough to live in the mountains of
Montana with a woman who has had just one
(1) domestic science course.—G. M.

look for beauty alone in choosing a wife. Be
sides the traditional Stanford poise, they must
have something on the domestic ball . . . they
must be able to possess as many household
graces as they do social graces.
And how does the curriculum afford them an
opportunity to learn these valuable husband
getting tricks? The answer is that the school
has one (1) course in domestic sciences. In
other words, the Administration is trying to
marry Stanford men off to women ungualified
for the duties of a housewife.
In these times of domestic strife, every able
bodied man is thinking of getting married and
then retiring to the mountains of Montana to
get away from it all (and the draft).
And it's tough to live in the mountains of
Montana with a woman who has had just one
(1) domestic science course.—G. M.
THAT Stanford women are paragons of virtue
we cannot deny. From the woolen underwear
of New England to the scanty bathing suits of
California, the charm and grace of Stanford
womanhood is a known fact.
No more does that noxious old maxim apply:
"Four out of five women are good-looking—and
the fifth goes to Stanford."
That was an unfair statement to make about
the Farmerettes, however. There was no statis
tical substantiation for any such claim. Stan
ford's cuties had every reason to complain that
they were being condemned by a sweeping gen
eralization that had never been proved. Perhaps
they were lucky that no proof was forthcoming.
They were probably lucky as hell. Figures
might have proved the contention true . . . may
be a statistical analysis of the situation might
have been worse than the old bromide.
But those days are gone forever. All Stanford
women are now gueens. From the remotest cor
ner of the cactus gardens to the lonely light that
burns on a Saturday night in Lagunita, they are
beautiful.
But do they have the reguisites to be good
housewives? Anyone knows that 99 per cent
of local womanhood is looking for a mate. Most
Stanford men are so overwhelmed by the con
summate beauty of our coeds that they no longer
look for beauty alone in choosing a wife. Be
sides the traditional Stanford poise, they must
have something on the domestic ball . . . they
must be able to possess as many household
graces as they do social graces.
