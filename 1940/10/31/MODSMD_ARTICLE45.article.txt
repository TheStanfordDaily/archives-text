FOUR years ago 1,200 Stanford men and
women pushed their way into the old As
sembly Hall on the eve of election day to hear
a forum discussion of the Landon-Roosevelt
campaign.
Last night 200 Stanfordites sank into the red
plush seats of Memorial Hall to listen to a
Willkie-Roosevelt debate. If last night's group
was numerically weaker it was certainly as
vocal as any group of its size.
It's difficult to determine just why Memorial
Hall wasn't packed last night. Judging from the
interest of the spectators, it should have been.
Maybe last night's meeting wasn't planned
sufficiently far ahead of time to allow adeguate
publicity. Maybe this week, of all weeks, was
a bad one for University students. The draft
lottery and the red wave of war that has en
gulfed the Balkans have shoved purely*political
thoughts into the background, have grabbed

black headlines and left party palaver for sec
ond-play spots. Maybe a winning football team,
appearing Saturday in the Colseum, has some
thing to do with the situation.
At any rate last night's crowd, though vocal,
was not large. Its best feature was its spirit of
participation. Nearly every member of the
audience followed each twist of reasoning, each
swift turn of argument.
And when the meeting was thrown open to
questioning from the floor, Moderator Bruce
Jessup had a hard time deciding which person
was on his feet first. When a point was well
presented, hammered home with logic and fact,
the audience recognized the verbal victory.
Whether the point favored Roosevelt or Willkie,
last night's crowd applauded.
The Stanford Forum had a solid, worth-while
premiere last night. If it can continue to present
such programs its success is a certainty.
The Farm has discussed political candidates—
today it will vote on them.
