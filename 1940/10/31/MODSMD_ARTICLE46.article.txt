### BUD AMES 
TO TICKEE. NO WASHYTON GAME
many of you this will be ihe last Daily you
will be reading until after the coming week-end
at U.C.L.A. Many of you, displaying your usual aca
demic fervor, are leaving today for the sunny south
land.
Here's hoping it won't be your last Daily (period).
Take it easy, those of you who are going by auto.
And to those of you who are going on the special
student train we bid you a fond farewell forever.
And when you get down to the Los Angeles sta
dium, here's hoping again that you don't run into
the same sort of gate trouble that Pat Smith, co
chairman of Rally Committee, had here last week.
You see, the Rally Committee goes over to the
stadium early on Saturday mornings to tack all those
card-stunt cards under the seats. So last Saturday
before the S.C. game there was Pat Smith, head
woman of Rally Committee, over in our stadium
tacking cards. About 10:30 o'clock in rushes the
B.A.C. bouncers, who, in all seriousness, inform our
heroine that she must either give them her ticket or
get out of the stadium.
Her rally sweater doesn't mean anything. Neither
does that pile of cards, and hammers, and tacks, and
everything. She just plain has to do one or the
other.

Pat produces her game ticket, they tear it to
shreds and then leave happily. Finally the cards
are all tacked up, and Pat leaves the stadium for a
little lunch. Unfortunately she leaves by an end zone
gate, and therefore doesn't get a pass-out check.
Comes game time, and here comes Pat up to the
gate, dressed to the teeth in Rally Committee white.
The gateman yells, "Hy ya, Pat? Who's going to win
the game?"
Then Pat explains her trouble about the passout
check. And the gateman says, "Sure, I know you,
Pat. But I can't let you in. Why don't you try the
end-zone gate?"
So Pat plods down to the end-zone gate. "Hy ya,
Charlie, Fred, and Bob? I forgot to get a pass-out
check. Can you let an ole head of Rally Committee
in?"
"Nope, I don't care if we are engaged. I can't let
you in. Rally Committee will have to go on alone."

these B.A.C. toughies broke down and let
our heroine into the end zone. But even then she
could only go as far as the wire fence which separates
the end-zone from the "uppercrust" seats. Three
more fence guards talked it over with Pat, kidded
about their last date, but decided they couldn't let
her in . The B.A.C. wouldn't like that. And they meant
it.
Things looked bad until, at last, a B.A.C. official
solved the problem. Looking furtively over each
shoulder, this official whispered, "Of course, you know,
I can't do this in an official capacity, but I think
we can sneak you in."
So she snuck in like The Shadow at a Harlem
night mud fight.
We certainly hope President Wilbur has his ticket
for the Washington game. No ticketâ€”no get in.
Just suppose:
"Hy ya, Albert and Standlee? Sure, I know you're
supposed to play in the game against Washington
this afternoon, but. the B.A.C. says you don't get in
without a ticket. Sorry."
