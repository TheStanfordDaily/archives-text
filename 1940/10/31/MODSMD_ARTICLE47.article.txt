r J I HE EDITOR, SIR:
This morning I was rudely awakened by some
one shouting: "Giuseppe Verdi—that's Italian for Joe
Green!" Two minutes later I was dashing up the
library steps. Quick —an Italian dictionary—name sec
tion —Giuseppe—Joseph. My pulses grew weak, I stag
gered. I could hardly bear to look. Verdi—my God!
Green. I could never have guessed it!
My sincere thanks to Reader \yeller for clarify
ing the situation.
Moral: Never try to be funny by being subtle when
writing to The Daily. "Non han finito ancor! Qual
derisione!" as Joe Green said.
Sincerely,
Guglielmo Moran
