INDIANS (on the Rose Bowl War Path):
As director of Stanford relations for the U. C.
L. A. 1940 Homecoming Celebration, it is my extreme
pleasure to extend a cordial invitation for all to at
tend our annual Homecoming Celebration.
To enumerate events that might be an added at
traction besides the informal party time atmosphere
so prevalent this time of year, we have the following
schedule:
1. Friday morning, Nov. 1, the Coronation of the
Homecoming Queen at 11 a.m. on the quad.
2. Open houses at all the fraternities and sororities
â€”also some floats will be built, and some students
will start to "fly low."
3. Date dinners will be held at all sororities and
fraternities.
4. The parade Friday night will be followed imme
diately by the bonfire, around which a student rally
will be held and broadcast.
5. Friday night at 10 o'clock a dance will be held
with Orrin Tucker and Bonnie Baker. Also, a tremen
dous amount of stars and guest artists will be in
attendance.
Saturday morning everyone will rest up for the
Homecoming game and the biggest upset of the year.
Come down and visit us this year, for it's "Teepee
Time Down South."
Sincerely,
Pierce Gannon
Director of Stanford Relations
