"AUDOBON'S AMERICA," by Donald Culross Peattie and published
by Houghton Mifflin Company.
When most people hear the name "Audobon" they immediately think
of the artist who drew so many pictures of wild life. Little else about his
fascinating; life is known. In this fine book the real Audobon is fully

described as the artist, naturalist,
journalist, and frontiersman that he |
was.
Audobon was sent to America in
1803 to avoid the dragnet of the Na- |
poleonic Wars. After unsuccessful
attempts at various enterprises he j
drifted West into the then little ;
country of the Alleghanies.
KEPT SKETCH BOOK
He kept going continually, never
being content to stay for long in
one place. His sketch book was al
ways in his hand, and he left a
wealth of drawings and sketches of
America as a result.
He went as far North as Labi'a
dor and South to Louisiana, where
he thoroughly explored the vast
cypress swamps. He traveled
through New England and as far ;
West as the "Mountains of the \
Winds," as he called the Rockies.
HAS SELF PORTRAIT
A part of Audobon's journal is ;
given with its individuality of spell- j
ing and unaccountable underscoring.
However, it shows Audobon to have (
been a good and reliable interpreter j
of the pioneer American Scene. The j
articles on the wildfowl of the West
are particularly good.
The real beauty of the book lies j
in its excellent, reproductions of j
some of the artist's lesser known j
drawings. Included are a self por
ti'ait and a view of Natchez, the city
where he got his first lessons in oil
painting from a wandering portrait
painter.
The book has been beautifully |
printed and much credit is due Mr. j
Peattie for his excellent, text and j
editing. If you don't care to read
the book, at least glance through it
to see the plates.â€”Wuenschel
