/ 1 REECE last night seemed to be
doomed—doomed to the fate of
the other countries which have been
forced to submit to the Axis pow
ers, whether by armed intervention
or by the threat of armed interven
tion.
The most conspicuous indication
that Greece can not hold out long
came from London, and reports
from other capitals, with the excep
tion of Athens, were no more en
couraging for the Greek cause.
A spokesman for the British gov
ernment, Lord Chatfield, Minister
of Defense Co-ordination, said in a
radio broadcast that Greece could
not expect Britain to send troops to
her assistance from across the
Mediterranean in Egypt, thereby
weakening her defense of the Suez.
"But sea and air power will be of
more help to Greece than a large
army sent to Salonika," he said.
This attitude on the part of a
high British official must mean
that Britain docs not want to have
a repetition in Greece of the Nor
wegian and Belgian catastrophes.
In fact, it is likely that the British
government looks upon the Axis
attack on Greece as a "bait" to
trap a British expeditionary force
sent to aid the Greeks.

JT IS probable that the diplomatic
war going on in the Balkans at
the present time is even more im
portant than the fighting going on
between Italians and Greeks some
where inside the Greek border.
The Greek radio broadcast last
night that "an Italian army corps
penetrated Greek territory but met
strong resistance and immediately
was repulsed."
From Rome reports, it would ap
pear that the Italians were making
substantial gains. Italian newspa
pers claim that Fascist legions have
penetrated 30 miles into Greek ter
ritory and are about to take the for
tified town of Janina.
These two dispatches are as con
tradictory as any pair of reports
since the Russo-Finnish skirmish.
But the diplomatic war is the one
observers in this country are
watching.
Suddenly yesterday, Franz von
Papen, German ambassador to Tur
key, abandoned his post and depart
ed for Germany. This move was re
garded with apprehension in An
kara, since the Germans are already
known to be exerting all possible
pressure on Turkey to prevent her
from coming to the aid of Greece.
German diplomats were exert
ing the same pressure on Bulgaria
and on Yugoslavia. Both of these
countries arc already Nazi-domi
nated, but to date there has been
no actual occupation by troops, as
has been the case in Rumania.
If the Italians are slowed in their
attack on the east, it is supposed that
the Germans would strike through
these countries from the north.
Salonika, one of the Axis objectives
in Greece, is a great deal more ac
cessible from this direction. Nazi
diplomats arc "urging" the govern
ments of Bulgaria and Yugoslavia to
permit the passage of German
troops, thus making possible an at
tack on Grcece from the north.

B UT. as has been pointed out be
fore, it is extremely doubtful
•whether Greece will be able to hold
out long enough to make such a
move on the part of the Germans
necessary. Greece is much more
likely to succumb to the undercover
activities of its strongly anti-British
fifth-column factions.
Although there is no new report
of an impending Greek-Italian
deal, it,s possibility certainly has
been increased by the declaration in
London that the British were in no
position to send an expeditionary
force to Greece.
Many Greeks, already offended by
the activities and attitude of King
George II who seems to them to be
more British than Greek, may
weigh this statement from London
as "the last straw." Pro-Axis
Prince Paul is likely to have many
new followers during the next few
days.

the Germans would strike through

out long enough to make such a

activities of its strongly anti-British
fifth-column factions.
Although there is no new report
of an impending Greek-Italian
deal, it,s possibility certainly has
been increased by the declaration in
London that the British were in no

doomed—doomed to the fate of
the other countries which have been
forced to submit to the Axis pow
ers, whether by armed intervention
or by the threat of armed interven
tion.
The most conspicuous indication
that Greece can not hold out long
came from London, and reports
from other capitals, with the excep
tion of Athens, were no more en
couraging for the Greek cause.
A spokesman for the British gov
ernment, Lord Chatfield, Minister
of Defense Co-ordination, said in a
radio broadcast that Greece could
not expect Britain to send troops to
her assistance from across the
Mediterranean in Egypt, thereby
weakening her defense of the Suez.
"But sea and air power will be of
more help to Greece than a large
army sent to Salonika," he said.
This attitude on the part of a
high British official must mean
that Britain docs not want to have
a repetition in Greece of the Nor
wegian and Belgian catastrophes.
In fact, it is likely that the British
government looks upon the Axis
attack on Greece as a "bait" to
trap a British expeditionary force
sent to aid the Greeks.

JT IS probable that the diplomatic
war going on in the Balkans at
the present time is even more im
portant than the fighting going on
between Italians and Greeks some
where inside the Greek border.
The Greek radio broadcast last
night that "an Italian army corps
penetrated Greek territory but met
strong resistance and immediately
was repulsed."
From Rome reports, it would ap
pear that the Italians were making
substantial gains. Italian newspa
pers claim that Fascist legions have
penetrated 30 miles into Greek ter
ritory and are about to take the for
tified town of Janina.
