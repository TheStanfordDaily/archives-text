# Series to Repeat Matterhorn Film
## 
### 
Do you want to get away from
politics and war? Would you like
to climb 14,782 feet to the top of
the* Matterhorn, or would you rather
/sit. in the soft Memorial Hall seats
and see someone else do it?
An English motion picture, "The
i Challenge," which answers these
questions, will be repeated in the
J Tuesday Evening Series on election
night, Nov. 5, at 7:30 o'clock in the
Auditorium of the Memorial Hall.
The picture was shown last sum
mer and is being repeated because
of popular demand, according to the
Committee on Public Exercises.
*The mighty Matterhorn, between
the frontiers of Italy and Switzer
land, is the hero of the plot. A hu
man being pits himself against a
mountain and thereby provides an
allegory for man's relentless fight
against nature. The "challenge" is,
; of course, the snowy peak herself,
j defying mountaineers to reach her
i summit.
