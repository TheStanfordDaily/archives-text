# Cards Invade Bruin Lair
## Unbeaten, Untied Indians To Defend Clear Record Bruins Will Attempt to Pull Upset On Stanford, Regain Lost Prestige 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Now fully aware of (heir chances of rolling through seven conference
opponents and into the Rose Bowl, Stanford's flashy football tenin will
invade Ix»s Angeles' Memorial Coliseum 53 strong, determined to keep
their unbeaten, untied record clean by stopping Coach Babe Iforrell's

U.C.L.A. Bruins.
In five short weeks Coach Clark
Shaughnessy and a bunch of foot
ballers who improve by the minute
have transformed Stanford's football
team from a so-so ball club that
would be lucky to win half its ball
games into the terror of the coast.
Now, however, they are and prob
ably will be the favorites in all their
ball games—a team with a mystify-

ng, deceptive, apparently unstop
>able offense, a team which doesn't
enow when it's beaten and which
:omes through best when the pres
;ure is on.
So tomorrow as 2 , /2-l favorites
ind hoping for their sixth straight
victory, these dark horses of the
:onference face a dangerous Bruin
earn. Though they have been bcat
?n in five straight games, the
3ruins are by no means an easy
ouch.
FEW TOUCHDOWNS
No team, not "even the highly
touted Texas Aggies, led by the
?reat John Kimbrough, Norm
Standlee's only rival for All-Ameri
can honors at fullback, has been able
to score more than one touchdown
against U.C.L.A. They have lost all
'of their tilts by heartbreakingly
close scores, twice 9-6, twice 0-7,
and once 7-0.
The Bruins are a strange case.
Last year they were runners-up in
the conference and were l'obbed of a
victory over the supposed national
champions, U.S.C., by the final gun;
having to be satisfied with a score
less tic. With most of their power
ful line returning and losing only
the mighty Kenny Washington from
their first-string backfield, the
Bruins were expected to do great
things again this year.
It doesn't seem right that the loss
of the capable Washington can ex
plain Ucla's feeble showing this
year. More likely they got of! to a
bad start against a good team,
Southern Methodist, and haven't
been able to pull themselves out. »f
their run yet.
SEEK PRESTIGE
Every week has been "vow
week" for the Bruins in their at
tempt to redeem themselves and
this week they have their biggest,
opportunity. For if they can .stop
the dazzling Indians they will have
regained most of their lost prestige.
But it will be quite a task to stop
(he Indians this week. Shaughnessy
has armed them with a few new
weapons of both ground and air at
tack and they themselves arc finally
realizing that they are a Rose Bowl
bound team.
And whether the uncertain Jackie
Robinson plays the key left, half
back position or the deploying right
half spot, Shaughnessy and his
board of strategy feels that they
have solved the Bruin offense.
One glaring weakness has stood
out in the U.C.L.A. defense in al
most every one of their games this
year and that is their ability to
knock down enemy pusses. After
Frankie Albert's brilliant display of
passing which baffled and beat
U.S.C. last Saturday, things look
rather bright for the aerial minded
Cards.
On the other hand the Bruin line
is big and tough from tackle to
tackle. It has slopped pretty well
some ol the best ground offenses in
the country, Santa Clara's, Southern
Methodist's, Oregon State's, and
Texas A and Ms.
ALWAYS ALBERT
YVilh the new tricks in their run
ning attack from the T-formation,
the Cards will try to pierce this
tough Ucla forward line and, even
ii' they don't make much impression
this way, they always have Albert's
talented pitching arm to depend on.
II Sfandlee shows he has the
power to consistently make yardage
between the Bruin ends, he will
have accomplished what both the
great Kimbrough and Oregon State's
candidate for All-American honors,
Jim Kis'selberg, failed to do.

invade Ix»s Angeles' Memorial Coliseum 53 strong, determined to keep
their unbeaten, untied record clean by stopping Coach Babe Iforrell's

U.C.L.A. Bruins.
In five short weeks Coach Clark
Shaughnessy and a bunch of foot
ballers who improve by the minute
have transformed Stanford's football
team from a so-so ball club that
would be lucky to win half its ball
games into the terror of the coast.
Now, however, they are and prob
ably will be the favorites in all their
ball games—a team with a mystify-

ng, deceptive, apparently unstop
>able offense, a team which doesn't
enow when it's beaten and which
:omes through best when the pres

So tomorrow as 2 , /2-l favorites

victory, these dark horses of the

earn. Though they have been bcat
?n in five straight games, the
3ruins are by no means an easy

FEW TOUCHDOWNS
No team, not "even the highly
touted Texas Aggies, led by the
?reat John Kimbrough, Norm
Standlee's only rival for All-Ameri
can honors at fullback, has been able
to score more than one touchdown
against U.C.L.A. They have lost all
'of their tilts by heartbreakingly
close scores, twice 9-6, twice 0-7,
and once 7-0.
The Bruins are a strange case.
Last year they were runners-up in
the conference and were l'obbed of a
victory over the supposed national
champions, U.S.C., by the final gun;
having to be satisfied with a score
less tic. With most of their power
ful line returning and losing only
the mighty Kenny Washington from
their first-string backfield, the
Bruins were expected to do great
things again this year.
It doesn't seem right that the loss
of the capable Washington can ex
plain Ucla's feeble showing this
year. More likely they got of! to a
bad start against a good team,
Southern Methodist, and haven't
been able to pull themselves out. »f
their run yet.
SEEK PRESTIGE
Every week has been "vow
week" for the Bruins in their at
tempt to redeem themselves and
this week they have their biggest,
opportunity. For if they can .stop
the dazzling Indians they will have
regained most of their lost prestige.
But it will be quite a task to stop
(he Indians this week. Shaughnessy
has armed them with a few new
weapons of both ground and air at
tack and they themselves arc finally
realizing that they are a Rose Bowl
bound team.
And whether the uncertain Jackie
Robinson plays the key left, half
back position or the deploying right
half spot, Shaughnessy and his
board of strategy feels that they
have solved the Bruin offense.
One glaring weakness has stood
out in the U.C.L.A. defense in al
most every one of their games this
year and that is their ability to
knock down enemy pusses. After
Frankie Albert's brilliant display of
passing which baffled and beat
U.S.C. last Saturday, things look
rather bright for the aerial minded
Cards.
On the other hand the Bruin line
is big and tough from tackle to

U.S.C. last Saturday, things look

YVilh the new tricks in their run

the Cards will try to pierce this
tough Ucla forward line and, even

Now fully aware of (heir chances of rolling through seven conference
opponents and into the Rose Bowl, Stanford's flashy football tenin will
invade Ix»s Angeles' Memorial Coliseum 53 strong, determined to keep
their unbeaten, untied record clean by stopping Coach Babe Iforrell's

U.C.L.A. Bruins.
In five short weeks Coach Clark
Shaughnessy and a bunch of foot
ballers who improve by the minute
have transformed Stanford's football
team from a so-so ball club that
would be lucky to win half its ball
games into the terror of the coast.
Now, however, they are and prob
ably will be the favorites in all their
ball games—a team with a mystify-

ng, deceptive, apparently unstop
>able offense, a team which doesn't
enow when it's beaten and which
:omes through best when the pres
;ure is on.
So tomorrow as 2 , /2-l favorites
ind hoping for their sixth straight
victory, these dark horses of the
:onference face a dangerous Bruin
earn. Though they have been bcat
?n in five straight games, the
3ruins are by no means an easy
ouch.
FEW TOUCHDOWNS
No team, not "even the highly
touted Texas Aggies, led by the
?reat John Kimbrough, Norm
Standlee's only rival for All-Ameri
can honors at fullback, has been able
to score more than one touchdown
against U.C.L.A. They have lost all
'of their tilts by heartbreakingly
close scores, twice 9-6, twice 0-7,
and once 7-0.
The Bruins are a strange case.
Last year they were runners-up in
the conference and were l'obbed of a
victory over the supposed national
champions, U.S.C., by the final gun;
having to be satisfied with a score
less tic. With most of their power
ful line returning and losing only
the mighty Kenny Washington from
their first-string backfield, the
Bruins were expected to do great
things again this year.
It doesn't seem right that the loss
of the capable Washington can ex
plain Ucla's feeble showing this
year. More likely they got of! to a
bad start against a good team,
Southern Methodist, and haven't
been able to pull themselves out. »f
their run yet.
SEEK PRESTIGE
Every week has been "vow
week" for the Bruins in their at
tempt to redeem themselves and
this week they have their biggest,
opportunity. For if they can .stop
the dazzling Indians they will have
regained most of their lost prestige.
But it will be quite a task to stop
(he Indians this week. Shaughnessy
has armed them with a few new
weapons of both ground and air at
tack and they themselves arc finally
realizing that they are a Rose Bowl
bound team.
And whether the uncertain Jackie
Robinson plays the key left, half
back position or the deploying right
half spot, Shaughnessy and his
board of strategy feels that they
have solved the Bruin offense.
One glaring weakness has stood
out in the U.C.L.A. defense in al
most every one of their games this
year and that is their ability to
knock down enemy pusses. After
