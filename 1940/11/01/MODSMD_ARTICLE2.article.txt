Defeating President Roosevelt by slightly less than a 3 to 1 vote, Wen
dell L. Willkie was named by Stanford students as their choice for the
next President of the United States in yesterday's campus straw vote.
The Farm faculty also chose Willkie, but by a 2 to 1 vote over Roose
velt.

Totals in the student election <
are:
Willkie 757
(Repuhlican-Townsend)
Roosevelt 276
(Democratic)
Thomas 43
(Progressive)
Browder 11
(Communist)
Bahson 11
(Prohibitionist)
Of the faculty members, voting in
a separate poll, 124 favored Willkie;
65 were for Roosevelt, and 4 for
Thomas. Browder and Babson re
ceived no votes. «• i»
In addition, two questions were
voted upon, with the following re
sults.
TWO QUESTIONS
If the tradition against a third
term were not involved in this elec
tion, which Presidential candidate
would you vote for?
Willkie 731
Roosevelt 301
Thomas 1
If there were no war in Europe
today, which Presidential candidate
would you vote for?
Willkie 709
Roosevelt 218
Thomas Mi
This reveals that for 58 of the 276
people voting for Roosevelt, the war
is the major issue. If there were no
war, they would vote for Willkie.
JUST THIRD TERM
And for 32 out of the 757 students
voting for Willkie, the third term is
the primary Issue. If there were no
third term, they would vote against
Roosevelt. Significant also is that
13 Roosevelt voters would favor
Thomas, if there were no war.
Results of yesterday's straw vote
indicate a 4 per cent loss in Will
kie support since The Daily's last
Presidential poll October 4.
Stanford professors indicated that
if a third term issue were not in
volved, they would favor Roosevelt
over Willkie. Conversely, Willkie
would have an even greater ma
jority over Roosevelt, if there were
no war in Europe.
Faculties of three schools, Gradu
ate Business, Engineering, and Law,
were unanimously for Willkie, while
Roosevelt had a majority in three
other schools. The Schools of So
cial Sciences, Letters, and Art named
Roosevelt over Willkie.
LOWER WANTS WILLKIE
Lower Division students favored
Willkie over the four other candi
dates more strongly than upper di
vision students. And graduates were
even more doubtful, with Willkie
tallying less than a 2 to 1 vote over
Roosevelt.
DAILY HELPS
The straw vote was jointly spon
sored by The Stanford Daily and Pi
Sigma Alpha, national political sci
ence fraternity, in co-operation with
Stanford Republican and Democratic
groups.
This was the sixth Presidential
straw vote held on the Stanford
campus. Stanford has voted Repub
lican in every election except 1912
whe;i Wilson defeated Roosevelt and
Taft.
