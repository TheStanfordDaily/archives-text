LOS ANGELES, Oct. 31 (UP).â€”
Coach Babe Horrell ran Stanford
plays against his U.C.L.A. Bruins to
day and attempted to build up a
defense to stop the sharpshooting
Indians Saturday. All Bruins, with
the exception of tackle Jack Som
mers, were in top physical shape.
Sommers is still suffering from a
leg injury.

There is no city in Alaska as
large as Burlingame, Calif.
