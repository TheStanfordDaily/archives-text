# Undefeated Card Frosh Favored Over J.C. Squad
## 
### DON SELBY 
In an attempt to run their string of victories to five straight, Stanford's
undefeated and untied freshman gridders take on thrice-beaten Chaffey
Junior College at 2 o'clock tomorrow afternoon in Stanford Stadium.
Although the Papoose squad should be rated the definite favorites, if
j only on the basis of comparative seasonal records. Chaffey might surprise
as underdogs often do.

However, Coach Harry Shipkey
| has been giving his charges plenty
jof work this week. And, as a rule,
| Irosh grid teams are not as often af
| fected by overconfidence as are var
sity elevens. All of which leads to
(he conclusion that the Papooses
j shouldn't have too much trouble
with the boys from the South this
week-end.
CAL LOOKS EASY
A victory tomorrow would send
> the frosh into the Little Big Game a
week hence as definite favorites, es
; pecially in view of the tough time
| the Ucla lrosh, whom Stanford de
; feated by a large margin, gave the
Cai Cubs last week-end.
For the first time this season.
Shipkey will start a largely revised
outfit, for, although he has made
one or perhaps two changes in the
line-up from game to game before,
I this week will see five boys on the
. field for the starting kickoff who
haven't opened a game this season.
The Papooses' set of "pony backs."
Joe Mardesich, Frank Forbes, Jim
Troupe, and Jackie Reynolds, will
j open in place of the regular quartet
of Bob Koch, Bob Mitchell. Buck
Fawcett, and Johnny Kenward. It
was the "ponj' back field" that l'ang
: up Stanford's first tally against, the
Trobabes last week-end, and if the
Chaffey gridders let any one of
them get past the line of scrim
mage Saturday it may mean a touch
down for the little Indians.
01 this backfield, Forbes is the
only one who has started a game for
the frosh. while Bill Wilson at right
I end, and Matt Petrlich at left guard
| are the other new starters. Dick
Abrams opened a couple of games
i at tackle early in the season, but
! this will be his first starting role
at right guard.
WILSON AFIRE
Wilson was on the sidelines for
the frosh's first few contests be
cause of injuries, but since his re
covery he has been going like a
house afire and should play some
good ball tomorrow.
Chaffey J. C. ended a two-game
losing streak last Friday night when
they dumped Pomona J.C., 13-0. A
pair of sub backs, Ed Hearn and
Pete Gibson, scored with breakaway
runs of 26 and 13 yards, respec
tively.
The probable starting line-up for
Chaffey J.C. is: Charles McFate, left
end; A1 Shaw, left tackle; Bernard
Schullz, left guard; Kenneth Kil
day (captain), center: Harry Muns,
right guard; Richard Davis, right
tackle: Leo Penn, right end; Curtis
Clemmer, quarter: Donald Norton,
left half; Dale Praym, right half;
and David Alcala. full.
The Papooses will open with Jim
Ellis at left end, Jean Lamoure at
left tackle, Petrlich at left guard.
Loren LaPrade at. center. Abrams at
right guard, Darwin Seeley at right
tackle, Wilson at right end. Rey
nolds at quarter, Forbes at left half,

Junior College at 2 o'clock tomorrow afternoon in Stanford Stadium.

as underdogs often do.

Cai Cubs last week-end.
For the first time this season.
Shipkey will start a largely revised
outfit, for, although he has made
one or perhaps two changes in the
line-up from game to game before,
I this week will see five boys on the
. field for the starting kickoff who
haven't opened a game this season.
The Papooses' set of "pony backs."
Joe Mardesich, Frank Forbes, Jim
Troupe, and Jackie Reynolds, will
j open in place of the regular quartet
of Bob Koch, Bob Mitchell. Buck
Fawcett, and Johnny Kenward. It
was the "ponj' back field" that l'ang
: up Stanford's first tally against, the
Trobabes last week-end, and if the
Chaffey gridders let any one of
them get past the line of scrim
mage Saturday it may mean a touch
down for the little Indians.
01 this backfield, Forbes is the
only one who has started a game for
the frosh. while Bill Wilson at right
I end, and Matt Petrlich at left guard
| are the other new starters. Dick
Abrams opened a couple of games
i at tackle early in the season, but
! this will be his first starting role
at right guard.
WILSON AFIRE
Wilson was on the sidelines for
the frosh's first few contests be
cause of injuries, but since his re
covery he has been going like a
house afire and should play some
good ball tomorrow.
Chaffey J. C. ended a two-game
losing streak last Friday night when
they dumped Pomona J.C., 13-0. A
pair of sub backs, Ed Hearn and
Pete Gibson, scored with breakaway
