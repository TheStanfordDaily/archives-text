p'OR the first time since the season
started the Indians today are not |
looking forward to playing an un
defeated team Saturday. But, me- j
thinks, in spite of the fact that the |
Bruins have yet to garner a victory, j
those who crowd the Coliseum to
morrow will witness a close, hard |
fought ball game.
The positions of the two teams 1
are exactly reversed since the same
time last year. In 1939 the Stanford
team was seeking its first win of the
year, While the Bruins were riding |
the crest of a victory wave that al
most carried them into the Rose
Bowl.
What happened that Saturday j
has not been forgotten. A light
ing Cardinal eleven outplayed the
vaunted Uclahs for the better part
of the game, seemed headed for a
win until one of Frankie Albert's
passes went haywire and the
Bruins tied up the ball game.
The same thing may very well
happen this year. Add paragraphs
one and three together and you
have the incentive that may inspire
Babe Horrell's team to play way ;
over their heads. Throw in the fact j
that no team, not even Texas A. and ;
M., S.M.U., or Santa Clara were '
able to score more than one touch
down against the Bruin defense, and
you have the ingredients of a major
upset.
* * *
r piIEN stop to think that Jackie
Robinson will be in good
physical shape for the first time j
since the Southern Methodist
opener, that U.C.L.A. is spotted
between Southern California and
Washington on the Stanford must 1
beat list, and that three Indian
first-stringers are in doubtful con
dition and things look even
blacker.
And all the good Coach Clark I
Shaughnessy has to put up against >
this vast array of circumstances is
a fighting, unbeaten and untied
bunch of boys who have come
through every test so far with flying
colors.
The odds on the game are absurd, i
Two and a half to one is too big a !
price for any game between two-
Coast Conference teams. If any j
U.C.L.A. backer wants my money I
he'll have to put up at ieast five
dollars to my eight, if I had eight.

Two and a half to one is too big a !
price for any game between two-
Coast Conference teams. If any j

he'll have to put up at ieast five

p'OR the first time since the season
started the Indians today are not |
looking forward to playing an un
defeated team Saturday. But, me- j
thinks, in spite of the fact that the |
Bruins have yet to garner a victory, j
those who crowd the Coliseum to
morrow will witness a close, hard |
fought ball game.
The positions of the two teams 1
are exactly reversed since the same
time last year. In 1939 the Stanford
team was seeking its first win of the
year, While the Bruins were riding |
the crest of a victory wave that al
most carried them into the Rose
Bowl.
What happened that Saturday j
has not been forgotten. A light
ing Cardinal eleven outplayed the
vaunted Uclahs for the better part
of the game, seemed headed for a
win until one of Frankie Albert's
passes went haywire and the
Bruins tied up the ball game.
The same thing may very well
happen this year. Add paragraphs
one and three together and you
have the incentive that may inspire
Babe Horrell's team to play way ;
over their heads. Throw in the fact j
that no team, not even Texas A. and ;
M., S.M.U., or Santa Clara were '
able to score more than one touch
down against the Bruin defense, and
you have the ingredients of a major
upset.
