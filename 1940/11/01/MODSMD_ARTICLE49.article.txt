OVER half the Stanford men and women
who will watch the Indians tomahawk
the Bruins in the Coliseum on Saturday will
drive south from Palo Alto.
Already that great trek has begun. It's a field
day for local constables at every wide spot in
the highway. A Stanford sticker, the legend
goes, is easy to spot and its driver is "good for
the cash," provided, of course, he makes the
error of failing to heed traffic rules.
And this week-end, too, may well be busy
season for ambulance drivers and undertakers.
Eight hundred miles of road to cover comprises
eight hundred miles of hazard.
Those of us who may spend a relatively quiet
Saturday afternoon huddled over a radio (by
necessity and not choice) will look forward to
seeing the rest of Stanford on the Quad Mon
day morning. We'd hate to miss you.
Take it easy, then. Give the other guy a
break. Remember that the Model A isn't com
peting with United Airlines on the Palo Alto- Los
Angeles run.
Remember that Stanford may make another
southern trip—about New Year's time. The
roses in that bowl are a lot sweeter than the
ones they'll pile over your casket after they
pick you out of an auto's twisted frame.
