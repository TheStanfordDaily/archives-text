# Houses Asked To End Rushing Before Dance
## Catacombs and Ennis Will Make Contrast For Cotillion Theme 
### 
Pete Whittlesey, president of In
terfraternity Council, has recom
mended that all fraternity houses end
their first rushing period by 9 o'clock
the night of the Sophomoi'e Cotillion
so that both the freshmen and the
members of the houses will be able
to attend the dance, which will be
from 9 to 12 o'clock next Friday.
The sophomores plan to make the
Cotillion so outstanding that no one
will want to miss it, and they will
appreciate the co-operation of the
houses.

GHOSTS TO SERVE
A combination of a "hell and
heaven atmosphere" with the sweet
tunes of Skinnay Ennis' orchestra
will be unusual and interesting. The
devil's punch bowl tended by bone
rattling skeletons and animated
ghosts will refresh the thirsty be
tween dances and during intermis
sions.
Dress for those who attend the
catacombs ball (or the corpses' night
off) will be semi-formal, with for
mals for the women and dark suits
| for the men.
