# Bellwether on Bucks
## 
### 
THE new statue on the libe fountain was really
a beauty. Finely chiseled lines outlined the
massive forehead of a dreamer, a face which
saw the better things in life. Perched on the
lower coping of the spouting fountain, it sur
veyed the Quad and passers-by from the classic
pose of Rodin's "The Thinker."
I drew closer. Marvelous bit of modern real
ism. Rather along cubist lines it seemed. May
be a bit out of proportion.
The statue spoke. "Hello, laddie, what's
Bruin?"
"Oh, it's only you, Bellwether," I answered
in a hurt tone. "What are you doing as a
statue?" It was "rather disconcerting.
The statue shifted slightly. Rodin would have
been surprised to see his "Thinker" assume a
left-handed pose.
"Listen, Emery," I muttered gruffly. "Come
out of it. You'll have to cut this statue stuff.
It's not the mustard, you know."
Bellwether, rather ungraciously, unfolded. It
was a mistake. His shoes and the ends of his
trousers were dripping as he hauled them rap
idly out of the fountain.
The Sage's tone was a masterpiece. "Laddie,"
he said, "I've been thinking."
I was not amazed. "Emery, what about?" I
waited expectantly.
Somewhere in America, there is a mother."
Bellwether's voice was virginally prophetic.
Had the great mind slipped? Was this the
sort of stuff Bellwether was made of? Then:
This mother is sitting by a fireside. On her
head is an old lace kerchief." Bellwether was
growing flowery. "In her lap are the canceled
checks which sent her son to Stanford." The
eloquent forefinger stabbed in my direction.
"And what is her son doing?"
I waved nebulously. "Oh, stuff and things."
I knew it wasn t a good answer. So did Emery.
Her son is sleeping through his eight o'clock,
going down to Paly for his nine o'clock, and
coking at the Cellar for his ten and eleven
o'clocks."
Oh, so that was it. Sounds great, Bellwether;
got a car?"
Bellwether was shocked, but evidently not
surprised. Laddie, I could have expected that
from you. Do you realize what that son is spend
ing for that morning's pleasure?"
Oh, I was still nebulous, "nickel for the
coke and a bit for gas."
The Sage was shocked to erect stiffness. If
I had not caught his threshing foot there would
have been an awfully wet Bellwether. "Laddie,
you left out four bucks that he spent."
I was mystified. "Bellwether, where do you
get that idea?"
Laddie, how much do you pay for one quar
ter's worth of learning at the Farm?"
Oh, plus another $20 for books and
fees."
Correct. The Sage beamed at my mathe
matics. \ou take an average of 15 units a
quarter, don't you?" I nodded. "And classes
last 10 weeks per quarter, don't they?" Again
the nod. "So you see!"
Even the Bellwether forefinger and its ges
tures didn't help. I thought. And I thought
some more. Then suddenly it came.
Bellwether," I beamed, "this is magnificent.
Marvelous deduction. Think I'll run off to my
ten o'clock and save some dough.

The Sage blushed a bit at my effusion. "Think
nothing of it, laddie. Glad to be of help."
"Bellwether," I said, "how long did it take you
to figure this out?"
"About two hours, laddie. Been sitting here,
thinking."
I looked at him admiringly. "Let's be off to
class, boy."
Not for me. Only had an eight and a nine
today!"

in a hurt tone. "What are you doing as a
statue?" It was "rather disconcerting.
The statue shifted slightly. Rodin would have
been surprised to see his "Thinker" assume a
left-handed pose.
"Listen, Emery," I muttered gruffly. "Come
out of it. You'll have to cut this statue stuff.
It's not the mustard, you know."
Bellwether, rather ungraciously, unfolded. It
was a mistake. His shoes and the ends of his
trousers were dripping as he hauled them rap
idly out of the fountain.
The Sage's tone was a masterpiece. "Laddie,"
he said, "I've been thinking."
I was not amazed. "Emery, what about?" I
waited expectantly.
Somewhere in America, there is a mother."
Bellwether's voice was virginally prophetic.
Had the great mind slipped? Was this the
sort of stuff Bellwether was made of? Then:
This mother is sitting by a fireside. On her
head is an old lace kerchief." Bellwether was
growing flowery. "In her lap are the canceled
checks which sent her son to Stanford." The
eloquent forefinger stabbed in my direction.
"And what is her son doing?"
I waved nebulously. "Oh, stuff and things."
I knew it wasn t a good answer. So did Emery.
Her son is sleeping through his eight o'clock,
going down to Paly for his nine o'clock, and
coking at the Cellar for his ten and eleven
o'clocks."
Oh, so that was it. Sounds great, Bellwether;
got a car?"
Bellwether was shocked, but evidently not
surprised. Laddie, I could have expected that
from you. Do you realize what that son is spend
ing for that morning's pleasure?"
Oh, I was still nebulous, "nickel for the
coke and a bit for gas."
The Sage was shocked to erect stiffness. If
I had not caught his threshing foot there would
have been an awfully wet Bellwether. "Laddie,
you left out four bucks that he spent."
I was mystified. "Bellwether, where do you
get that idea?"
Laddie, how much do you pay for one quar
ter's worth of learning at the Farm?"
Oh, plus another $20 for books and
fees."
Correct. The Sage beamed at my mathe
matics. \ou take an average of 15 units a
quarter, don't you?" I nodded. "And classes
last 10 weeks per quarter, don't they?" Again
the nod. "So you see!"
Even the Bellwether forefinger and its ges
tures didn't help. I thought. And I thought
some more. Then suddenly it came.
Bellwether," I beamed, "this is magnificent.
Marvelous deduction. Think I'll run off to my
ten o'clock and save some dough.

The Sage blushed a bit at my effusion. "Think
nothing of it, laddie. Glad to be of help."
"Bellwether," I said, "how long did it take you
to figure this out?"
"About two hours, laddie. Been sitting here,
thinking."
I looked at him admiringly. "Let's be off to
class, boy."
Not for me. Only had an eight and a nine
today!"
THE new statue on the libe fountain was really
a beauty. Finely chiseled lines outlined the
massive forehead of a dreamer, a face which
saw the better things in life. Perched on the
lower coping of the spouting fountain, it sur
veyed the Quad and passers-by from the classic
pose of Rodin's "The Thinker."
I drew closer. Marvelous bit of modern real
ism. Rather along cubist lines it seemed. May
be a bit out of proportion.
The statue spoke. "Hello, laddie, what's
Bruin?"
"Oh, it's only you, Bellwether," I answered
in a hurt tone. "What are you doing as a
statue?" It was "rather disconcerting.

I was not amazed. "Emery, what about?" I
waited expectantly.
Somewhere in America, there is a mother."
Bellwether's voice was virginally prophetic.
Had the great mind slipped? Was this the
sort of stuff Bellwether was made of? Then:
This mother is sitting by a fireside. On her
head is an old lace kerchief." Bellwether was
growing flowery. "In her lap are the canceled
checks which sent her son to Stanford." The
eloquent forefinger stabbed in my direction.
"And what is her son doing?"
I waved nebulously. "Oh, stuff and things."
I knew it wasn t a good answer. So did Emery.
Her son is sleeping through his eight o'clock,
going down to Paly for his nine o'clock, and
coking at the Cellar for his ten and eleven
o'clocks."
Oh, so that was it. Sounds great, Bellwether;
got a car?"
Bellwether was shocked, but evidently not
surprised. Laddie, I could have expected that
from you. Do you realize what that son is spend
ing for that morning's pleasure?"
Oh, I was still nebulous, "nickel for the
coke and a bit for gas."
The Sage was shocked to erect stiffness. If
I had not caught his threshing foot there would
have been an awfully wet Bellwether. "Laddie,
you left out four bucks that he spent."
I was mystified. "Bellwether, where do you
get that idea?"
Laddie, how much do you pay for one quar
ter's worth of learning at the Farm?"
Oh, plus another $20 for books and
fees."
Correct. The Sage beamed at my mathe
matics. \ou take an average of 15 units a
quarter, don't you?" I nodded. "And classes
last 10 weeks per quarter, don't they?" Again
the nod. "So you see!"
Even the Bellwether forefinger and its ges
tures didn't help. I thought. And I thought
some more. Then suddenly it came.
Bellwether," I beamed, "this is magnificent.
Marvelous deduction. Think I'll run off to my
ten o'clock and save some dough.

The Sage blushed a bit at my effusion. "Think
nothing of it, laddie. Glad to be of help."
"Bellwether," I said, "how long did it take you
to figure this out?"
"About two hours, laddie. Been sitting here,
thinking."
I looked at him admiringly. "Let's be off to
class, boy."
Not for me. Only had an eight and a nine
today!"
