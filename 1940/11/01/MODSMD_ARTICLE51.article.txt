### BUD AMES 
NOTES BEFORE HEADING SOUTH
WOME of you have been wondering about those
L "Hollywoodish" card stunts pulled off by the S.C.
rooting section last Saturday. Some suggested that
it would be nice for Stanford to do something in a
similar vein in the Stanford card stunts.
Rally Committee, in charge of that sort of activi
ties, says it just can't be worked out. In the the first
place, we usually sit on the shady side. And you can
thank your heavenly B.A.C. that you do. Sun is sun
but sun in the eyes is no fun. Secondly, it costs
over $700 to supply the S.C, rooting section with
those flashy cards. Our Rally Committee, who do
not get as large a budget, do card stunts for a whole
season for a little over $200.
That means that we would have to save those
flashy cards for four years in order to make the
books balance. Not so good.
And incidentally, those reflector stunts require spe
cial designing. S.C. hires a professional Hollywood
designer to dope out their stunts. U.C.L.A., whose
stunts will make S.C. look sick tomorrow, hires a
man from the Walt Disney studio.
That about ends that.

r next item hardly comes under the head of
"local." But it is important, and as such rates
some comment even in all this jumble.
We speak of the move made recently by Wendell
Willkie in getting boxer Joe Louis to do a little
Republican campaigning. On the surface, this may
seem to you like a big joke and possibly just a little
more of the ballyhoo that is a presidential campaign.
In reality this lining-up of Joe Louis has deeper
roots.
You may or may not have heard it before, but some
politicians have stated that the negros in this country
swing enough electoral votes, especially around big
cities like Chicago and New York, to swing the na
tional election one way or the other with a little con
certed action.
Think it over. And if you don't think Joe Louis
packs a presidential wallop with the United States
colored population, you'd better sit down in your 8
o'clock and think it over again. Just hark back to all
the negro riots they had in the big cities the night
that Max Schmeling sent Louis crashing to the canvas
for the count.
So when you read in the paper about shuffling,
sleepy Joe Louis saying, "I am for Willkie because I
think he will help my people. I figure my people ought
to be for him too"—don't laugh or snicker. Some Re
publican has gotten very smart and is not so calmly
marching a mass of dusky votes over into the Willkie
plantation.
* * # *
aren't as bad here at. home as you might
think. At least you don't have to get a permit to
hate somebody. Sounds silly, but up in the marshes
across the bay—that means the University of Califor
nia—the guys and gals had to get a permit from the
city fathers yesterday in order to hate Stanford during
the coming Big Game period.
That IS silly.
And what is even sillier, their student-body presi
dent John McPherson solemnly promised the fathers
in return that no street cars would be overturned, no
theater doors broken down, no policemen attacked if
the '"Hate Stanford" ban was lifted.
That's almost as bad as promising that Cal is going
to win the Big Game.
