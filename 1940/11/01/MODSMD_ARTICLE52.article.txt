## OFF-CAMPUS OPINION 
### 
(The following statement appeared in (lie edi
torial columns of The Daily Trojan and is here
reprinted for "those who walk on the Quad." —
The Editor)

IN reciprocation of the smug compliment offered S.C.
by Colin McClintock, Stanford football star, who
so patronizingly nods at us in the Stanford Daily col
umn, Campus Opinion —we take offense at his con
descension.
He pleads for no more mud-slinging at S.C. in his
letter to the "Dippy," as the Stanford publication is
aptly termed by its readers. He remarks that al
though "we may feel superior intellectually to S.C.
and their athletes, please let's not stoop to the point
of tearing them down in our Daily." We find his
usage of the words "intellectually" and "stoop" grossly
inappropriate.
St. Mary's Collegian exchange editor, Bill Feneran,
quoted from McClintock's amazing balderdash, term
ing the grid-star-turned-writer "blasphemous" with
the suggestion tTiat we settle accounts.
That suggestion is well taken here in the south
land, where the opinion is not prevalent that Stan
ford breeds a race of superior men (or women).
Feneran proposed a spelling bee to settle accounts.
All we want is a reasonable basis for this conceit.
Naturally, the implication that only THE PEOPLE go
up to the Farm seems unfounded to us. We extend
a sincere challenge for factual support of the supe
riority complex reflected in McClintock's letter. There
is something distasteful about carrying justifiable
school pride and spirit to the point of being "stuffy."
Of course, Stanford is a good college. To Mr. Mc-
Clintock and his deigning colleagues, however, we
put this query: Honestly now, do you really feel that
he who walks the Quad walks with God?—R. H.
