# ROUSING IN RHYME
## 
### 
'T'HE EDITOR, SIR:
..."Christian" leaders who endorse fighting for
Democracy might appropriately close their rabble
rousing talks to students by leading in singing the fol
lowing hymn, composed by Carl A. Brown:
"Onward Christian soldiers, stick those long knives in,
Fill them full of bullets, blow them limb from limb.
Like the gentle Savior, whom we all adore,
Poison them with gases, baptize them with gore.
"Raze their glorious country, burn their homes and
grain,
Show to them no mercy, let them lie in pain.
This is holy conflict, let God's will l>c done;
Kill their wives and children, spare not anyone.
"Let the brave all murder, 'tis the Lord's desire.
Forth to the bloody conflict, filled with holy fire,
Do not weaken ever, kill like saints of yore.
Strike till men and nations perish evermore."
Ri sjx>ctfully submitted.
A Super-Patriot
