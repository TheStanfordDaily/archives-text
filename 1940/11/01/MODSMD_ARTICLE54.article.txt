# Roadrunners Get Warm Reception in Drafty Tent
## 
### 
"YES, MY DARLING DAUGH
TER," produced by the Roadrunners,
now playing in a tent on Embarca
dero two blocks east of Middleiield.
If this show is to be judged by the
size of the crowd, it was not a suc
cess. But if it is to be judged by
the fine amateur acting and the au
dience reaction, it IS a success.
Marianne Breuner, playing the
part of an authoress with a definite
past, handled the role with ease.
Particularly outstanding was Fred
Clark as Titus Jaywood, the past in
the mother's life.
MOTHER DID IT
The plot revolves around the
mother and her modern daughter,
who finds herself in the same situa
tion as did her mother 20 years be
fore Margaret Wood portrayed Ellen
Murray, the daughter. In spite of
the coldness of the tent. Miss Wood
gave warmth to her part.
These stars were well backed by
George Wood, Margaret Paulson,
J P. Cahn, the producer and co-or
dinator of the Roadrunners, and Hal
Keith.
These productions deserve much

more support than they are receiv
ing. This reviewer went to last
night's performance expecting to see
a typical amateur show with many
awkward pauses and forgotten lines,
but that illusion was marred by the
smoothness of the production.
' Yes, My Darling Daughter" will
be shown again tonight with a re
turn engagement of "Private Lives"
scheduled for tomorrow night.

The Roadruners are mainly Stan
ford graduates. All of their para
phernalia can be packed into their
large truck and trailer and moved en
masse.
They have their own lighting sys
tem composed of a generator and
cast-off automobile headlights.
From here the show will move to
Los Gatos for two nights, then to
San Jose for three more. This ven
ture proves that amateur produc
tions can be produced with a pro
fessional finesse.—Horrall
Paul Robeson was Phi Beta Kappa
