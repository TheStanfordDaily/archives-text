# FIRST NUMBER THAT OF THEIR SON
## 
### 

CONSCRIPTION STRUCK HOME immediately upon the drawing of the first number by Secretary of
War Slimson Tuesday. In the room where the drawing was made were Harry Bell (right), World War
veteran, and Mrs. Bell. The first number drawn—no. 158 —was that of their son, Robert, 21. Mrs. Bell's
exclamation was heard by radio listeners immediately after President Roosevelt read the number. Draft
Director Dr. Clarence A. Dykstra is between the Bells.
