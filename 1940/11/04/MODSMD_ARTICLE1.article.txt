r rHE United States is one of the
few remaining countries where
people have the opportunity of
choosing their own governmental
representatives.
Tomorrow, Americans will elect
their highest public officer for a
four-year period and at the same
time select numerous other officials
of varying degrees of importance.
In 1788, Americans elected their
first President under the then re
cently-ratified Constitution, and they
have been electing Presidents at
four-year intervals ever since.
Over the course of these more than
150 years the American people have
come to look upon several of their
past leaders as superior Presidents.
Voters have perhaps not considered
the characteristics that place these
Presidents in a more revered light.
* * â™¦
r JHHE ideal method of selecting a
President might be to define the
qualifications of outstanding men
who have held the office and then
select candidates who best fill these
requirements.
But voters tomorrow will select
their President from a list of four
or five candidates. There will be
little opportunity to apply idealistic
tests in the selection.
In some cases the choice will be
more on the basis of emotions than
on reasoning; and at any rate there
can be no "right and wrong" nor
"yes and no" distinctions between
the two major party candidates. Too
many persons are going to cast their
votes for both of these candidates to
make any dogmatic "right and
wrong" statement, and as long as
individual personalities differ in a
democratic society, voters will differ
on the choice of two political can
didates.
But in spite of the fact that
there is no "right" and "wrong"
nor "yes" and "no" distinction
between the two men, voters will
be asked to make just this distinc
tion when they elect one of the
candidates and discard the other.
Neither candidate is all "right"
and neither is all "wrong," but that
is the choice voters will have to
make.
In a class in "American Democ
racy" last Friday, Professor Edgar
Eugene Robinson said:
"We expect so much more of our
Presidents than we expect of our
selves that when they don't live up
to these expectations we let them
know."
Certainly this is the American
system of throwing out one party
and replacing it with the other.

pROFESSOR ROBINSON listed
the six qualities that we seem to
demand in our Presidents:
(1) Experience in government;
(2) technical knowledge of the
machinery of government: (!5)
leadership in a major political
party; (4) ability to state great
public issues; (5) ability to sell
oneself to the people; (({) and in
tellectual integrity.
These are the qualities that
Americans expect in their Presi
dents. When these six arc combined
in one man, we have the symbol
which is the great American Presi
dent. That is the historical record.
But tomorrow voters will not ask
themselves which of the candidates
possesses these characteristics. They
will instead choose the candidate
most acceptable to them. For some,
there will be only one candidate;
for others, there will be a difficult
choice between two men, neither of
whom is "all right" or "all wrong."
