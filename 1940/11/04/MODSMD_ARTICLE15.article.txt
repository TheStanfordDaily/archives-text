## Both Candidates Appear Confident As 'Race-Horse' Finale Predicted 
### 
NEW \ OKK, Nov. 3 (L'l®). —The 1!M0 presidential campaign roared
toward a noisy end tonight with feuding leaders of organized labor joined
in a forecast that the men and women who toil will decide the most
bitterly fought contest in a quarter of a century.
The verdict actually lies with some 50,000,000 persons who arc ex-

pected to exercisc on Tuesday the<
greatest privilege of democracy
gives its citizerus—use of the ballot.
Polls open in the morning and some
hint of the will of the people may
be' available by midnight.
IT WILL BE CLOSE
Polls and private surveys forecast
a "race horse" finish. TTicy clash
with optimistic predictions of forces
backing candidates Franklin D.
Roosevelt and Wendell L. Willkie.
Both men appeared confident as the
campaign reached the stretch.
The Sabbath brought only a slight
lull in the struggle for the nation's
highest honor. The President re
turned to Washington from Cleve
land, 0., where, in the fifth of a
series of six major campaign
speeches, he asked for a vote of
confidence for a third—and final
term. He spent part of the day in
conference on international prob
lems with Secretary of State Cordell
Hull and prepared to leave tonight
for his Hyde Park, N.Y., home.
CANDIDATES SPEAK
There he will learn whether his
bid for another four years in power
has been accepted or rejected by
the electorate. He will make a final
appeal for support in a speech to be
delivered between 11 p.m. and 11:30
p.m. tonight over the three na
tional networks.
Willkie, who told a crowd that
jammed the rafters at Madison
Square Garden last night that "vic
tory, victory- Is on the march," spent
a comparatively quiet Sabbath. Ac
companied by members of his fam
ily, the Republican candidate at
tended Episcopal Church services
and heard Rector Henry Darlington
urge parishioners to vote on Tues
day,
"Our citizenship in this country is
not only a great privilege but a re
sponsibility—it is your responsibility
to keep it a privilege," the clergy
man said.
VOTE TOMORROW
A similar plea was voiced by
President Roosevelt. In a statement
declaring that "it is a duty to the
nation that every citizen should ex
ercise the solemn right, of suffrage
guaranteed under the constitution,"
the chief executive added:
"It therefore beehoves all citizens
to co-operate to the end that the
largest number eligible shall regis
ter their preference in the elections
to be held on Tuesday, Nov. 5, next.
