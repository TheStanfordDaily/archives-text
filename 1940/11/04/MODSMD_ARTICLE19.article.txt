An overflowing Stanford rooting
section "gave 'em the axe" in the
Los Angeles Coliseum Saturday af
ternoon as the Cardinals marched
to their seventh straight win, the
sixth straight win of the season in
as many games, and the lowly
Bruins' sixth straight loss of the
season.
Indian supporters flocked to the
Southland for the annual tussle,
leaving the Farm as early as Wed
nesday, going by auto, plane, train,
and even "thumb."
Estimates of the number travel
ing south were placed as high as
2,000 students, many of whom rode
the Stanford Special.
Game time was 2:15 o'clock, yet
rooters arriving at 2 o'clock were
forced to sit in a special space next
to the overflowing cheering section,
attesting to the large crowd.
Card stunts by both U.C.L.A. and
Stanford rooters featured half-time
entertainment, with an Indian brave
chasing the Bruin's scalp on the
playing field .
Saturday night found celebrants
in Hollywood's famous Cocoanut
Grove, Earl Carroll's, and the new
Palladium, where Tommy Dorsey
recently opened.
