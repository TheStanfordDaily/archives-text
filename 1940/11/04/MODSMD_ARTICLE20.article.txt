## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 3 (UP). â€”
Draft experts have completed Ihe
outline of a program under which
conscientious objectors would be
put to work on non-combattant na
tional defense projects sponsored
either by the government or relig
ious organizations, it was learned
tonight.
The program, drawn along liberal
lines, is designed to carry out that,
portion of the selective service act
which states that conscientious ob
jectors can be excused from mili
tary training provided they are as
signed to work of "national im
portance under civilian direction."
Under the act, such an objector is
defined as one who "by reason of
religious training and belief, is con
scientiously opposed to participation
in war in any form."
