COLISEUM, LOS ANGELES,
Nov. 2 (Special to The Daily).â€”
Stanford's all - victorious Indian
griddors played Jackie Robinson
and ten other Bruins in the Coli
seum at Iyos Angeles Saturday,
and the sparkling Indians rolled
to a 20-14 victory over the now
six-time losers, U.C.LA.. in a
game that put Stanford one step
closer to the coveted Rose Bowl
bid.
But, although they played brilliant,
ball, the Indians had their hands
full with the Bruins' one and only
offensive threat, Robinson, who
probably played the best game of
his young life Saturday.
STANDLEE SHINES
Indian ball carriers, especially
Norm Standlee, Stanford's candidate
for Ail-American honors, had a field
day, running up 372 yards from
ground plays alone, and adding 38
yards from passes, as the vaunted
Bruin defense wilted before the hard
blocking of the Indians' forward
wall. As the statistics showed, Stan
ford was always the master of the
game, doing anything they wanted,
anytime they wanted to. That is,
everything but completely stopping
Robinson.
Nine minutes after the start of the
battle the Indians rang up touch
down number one in as fast an ex
hibition of offensiv football as
anyone would want to see. The In
dians marched 67 yards, starting
when Gallarneau, running
like an entirely different man than
last year's Hugh Gallarneau, cut
back inside the Uclan right end for
a 21-yard gain. Then "Skeeter" Pe
ter Kmetovic broke through the
line and scooted down the sidelines
for 33 yards before he was knocked
out of bounds. From that point
Duke Gallarneau whacked inside of
tackle to pay dirt. Frankie Albert
kicked the extra point from Kmeto
vic's fingers.
TOUCHDOWN NO. 2
Starting on their own 13, the In
dians drove 87 yards for their sec
ond tally. It was Kmetovic off
tackle for live. And then "Chief"
Standlee, handling his 225 pounds as
if he were a lightweight, plowed
through the line, dove over line
backer Matthews, landing with one
hand on the ground, and sped down
the field for 42 yards gained before
being brought down by Ben Kvitky.
It was amazing the way this huge
giant, Standlee, ran by defenders as
if they were standing still.
Gallarneau roared over left tackle
for 14 yards, after the Indians had
been set back five yards for too
many times out. Kmetovic gained
nothing, and on third down with
one yard to go for a first down,
Standlee ran the end and lateralled
to Gallarneau, who fumbled momen
tarily, regained control of the ball,
and went for five, yards and a first
down. Standlee gained three, but
the Stanfords lost that and two more
on another time out penalty.
ALBERT PASSES
On fourth down after line plays
by Standlee and Eric Armstrong,
who had replaced Gallarneau, had
gained but four yards, Albert cross
ed up the Bruins, who expected a
kick. And most teams would have
kicked in this position, but not dar
ing Frankie. Running wide to his
left with Uclan defenders closing in
on him rapidly, Albert leaped into
the air and flipped the ball into the
end zone to Clemmie Tomerlin,
who leaped a good three yards into
the air to spear the ball with Ray
Bartlett on him like a shadow. Al
bert converted.
With the second half under way
the Bruins began to come to life
when they took the ball on the
Stanford 48 after the Indians were
penalized for unnecessary rough
ness. Izzy Cantor's second-down
pass to Milt Smith gained 19 yards
as Don MacPherson recovered when
Smith fumbled. Then the Uclans
pulled a pass that pulled Stanford's
defensive right half up into the flat
as MacPherson cut over far behind
him to take Cantor's toss in the
clear. MacPherson romped over
withefut a hand being laid on him.
Robinson converted to make the
score 14-7.
GALLARNEAU AGAIN
Then it was the Indians' turn
again, and they went for their third
touchdown in six plays from the
Bruin 42 in this manner: Albert for
eight on a quarterback sneak. Two
plays gained nothing, and on fourth
down Frankie pitched the second of
his two completed passes of the
afternoon to Kmetovic for 24 yards,
to the 10. From there Gallarneau
hit inside tackle for six and again
through the same spot for the score.
Albert's conversion attempt was
wide.
From there on it was practically
Robinson's show, starting when he
intercepted Albert's pass on the
Bruin 36. Failing to find a receiver
on an intended pass play, the negro
flash sped to score.
