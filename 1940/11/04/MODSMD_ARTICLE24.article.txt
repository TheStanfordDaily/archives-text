The United States cannot fight
the totalitarian nations with their

•CONTINUE TRADE'
Dr. Brandt maintained that trade
must continue regardless of world
political structure. He said that gov
« rnment subsidy of private enter
prise in competition for foreign mar
kets is the limit to which the Uni
ted States should go in trying to
compete with totalitarian nations.
"We should do everyhing in our
power to keep international co-op
« ration and good will alive in the
lion-totalitarian world, and to
strengthen those who fight for
themselves and for us against the
totalitarian regimes," pleaded Dr.
Brandt.
THE NKW ORDER'
Professor Steiner spoke on Ja
pan's "new order" in East Asia. He
vas in China when the war began

ically self-sufficient area in which
co-operation of the Chinese is
sought.
