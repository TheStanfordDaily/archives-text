SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 3 (UP).
|â€”A typhoon believed 1o have been
! of disaster proportions early today
| swept across the island of Guam,
: United States' important far eastern
j Pacific naval base, causing damage
and "distress among the civil popu
lation," naval headquarters re-
I ported.
Howling gales that reached the
terrific velocity of 150 miles an hour
shortly after midnight wrecked the
Pan American Airways hotel and
, damaged the navy's hangar at
Guam, it was reported by both the
navy and Pan American. Guam is
1500 miles east of Manila.
Full extent of casualties among
the white and native population,
and property damage to the city of
; Apra and the naval base could not
be determined immediately on the
basis of meager messages reaching
i the mainland through interrupted
communications.
