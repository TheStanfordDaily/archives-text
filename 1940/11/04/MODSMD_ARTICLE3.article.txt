# Italo-Greek Forces Open Major Fight
## Janina Sector Buttle May Decide Outcome Of Invasion Attempt 
### 
HOME, Nov. 3 (UP). â€” Reliable
Fascist quarters reported tonight
that Greek and Italian troops were
locked in the Janina sector of
Greece in a raging battle which
might decide the outcome of the
whole war.
The opposing forces were said to
have hurled their full might at each
other.
Two other Italian columns were
reported "advancing" through the
invaded country toward major ob
jectives. One was thought to be
pressing down the west coast of
Greece.
FRONTIER DRIVE CRUCIAL
Probably the most important of all
operations from the strategic stand
point, spokesmen said, was a drive
along the Greek-Jugoslav frontier
north of Salonika.
(The dispatch made no mention of
the extent of the advance. To be
literally "north of Salonika" such a
spearhead would have had to be
driven eastward some 100 miles
from the Greek-Albanian frontier.)
A thrust to Salonika would cut
off Thrace from the remainder of
Greece and communications be
tween the Greek mainland and many
of the islands would be hampered.
ITALIANS CLAIM VICTORY
The Italian war communique
claimed that the invading forces
"have overcome with decisive strat
egy numerous defense lines which
were well fortified and strongly sup
ported by delaying tactics."
The newspaper Popolo Di Roma
said that the Greek general staff ex
pected the Greek army to hold their
frontier positions against the Italians
for at least two weeks. It said that
the Italians were occupying Greece
to eliminate any threat of war in
the Balkans and to place forces in a
position to drive toward British po
sitions in the Mediterranean.
