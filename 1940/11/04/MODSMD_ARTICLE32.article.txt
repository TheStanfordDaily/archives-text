# Series to Show 'The Challenge'
## Mountaineering Film Offered Tomorrow 
### 
With a mighty mountain chal
lenging all comers to ascend its sum
mit as the background, "The Chal
lenge," an English motion picture,
will be presented for the Tuesday
Evening Series tomorrow night at
7:30 o'clock in Memorial Hall.
The conquest of the Matterhorn,
rising 14,782 feet above the Italian-
Swiss border, provides the historical
background for the picture. This
film is the first to be photographed
at such an altitude.
DANGEROUS TASK
The motion picture company that
ascended the Alps for its magnifi
cent and realistic scenes is the first
to record a drama in such a natural
setting. Scenes were actually pho
tographed on the Matterhorn.
The cast includes Robert Douglas,
Joan Gardner, Luis Trenker, and
Mary Clare. The art director is Vin
cent Korda. Outstanding photog
raphy of Georges Perinal is fea
tured. The "Washington Post" said
in a review of the film, "The cam
eraman is the real hero of this
picture."
PLOT TOLD
The story revolves around the
jealousy and pride involved in
climbing the Matterhorn. Jean An
toine Carell, Italian guide and here
of the plot, knows the mountair
| better than any other man and love;
i it with a jealous passion.
He is determined to reach it;
; summit one day, thereby winning
i glory and tourist trade for his na
i tive town of Breuil. The competi
i tion, tragedy, and excitement in
i volved in attaining the goal provide
j the basis for the story.
