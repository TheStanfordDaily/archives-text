# Farm Fencing Squad Holds Oakland to Tie
## 
### 
Stanford's fencing squad fought to
an 8-8 tie with the Oakland foilers j
Friday evening in the Encina Gym.
Sorely missing the services of Mar
lin Nelson and Bob Boyd, who went j
south to see the football game, !
Coach Elwyn Bugge's outfit used a
four-man team which fared pretty
well despite the lack of the two
veterans.
