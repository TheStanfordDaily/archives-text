touchdown. Coldiron made the
extra point good. Final score:
Stanford Frosh 38, Chaffey 0.
Clicking like a full-fledged Red Machine, Stanford's high-scoring
freshman grid team continued its march toward a perfect season here
Saturday, rolling over Chaffey J.C. 38 to 0.
The Papooses chalked up three touchdowns in each half while keeping
their own g<ial line immaculate. Only time the Jayseers passed the year
ling 20, they were turned back

a net gain of but three yards on
four plays.
Every man on the Stanford bench
saw action in the encounter, which
served fair notice on the Cal Cubs
that they are in for trouble in the
Li tie Big Game next week.
PASSES CLICK
Again it was the frosh passing
attack that paid dividends. Three of
the tallies were scored on pass plays,
while two more climaxed passing
drives deep into enemy territory.
Fullback Randall Fawcett accounted
for another with a 56-yard sprint
down the sidelines, after taking a
wide lateral from the flanker posi
tion.
After a scoreless first quarter, the
Papoose attack started to roll early
in the second. A poor Chaffey punt
and two running plays gave the
Cards a first down on the J.C. 32.
On the next play, Johnny Kenward
faded back and rifled a perfect pass
to John Reynolds, who took it over
his shoulder at a dead run on the
1-yard line to score. Jim Troupe
booted a perfect conversion to make
it 7-0.
SECOND SCORE
In the same period, Kenward
pulled down a Chaffey pass on his
own 47 to set up the second Card
tally. With Kenward and Bob
Mitchell carrying the mail, the
frosh punched their way to the
enemy 12. There, on fourth down,
they shook Mitchell into the clear
in the end zone and Bob Koch hit
him with a perfect toss. The con
version was wide—l 3-0.
Stanford kicked off and two plays
later they were again holding hands
with a touchdown. A holding pen
alty on the kick-off return set Chaf
fey back to its own 20. Tackle Jim
Cox set them back further by drop
ping Norton for a 7-yard loss. The
J.C. quarter elected to quick kick,
but Cox again strolled into their
backfield to block it. and guard Bill
Joslyn smothered the ball on the 14.
Four running plays featured by a
nifty end-around by Morris Madden
took the frosh to the 2. where Keith
Pinion punched through center for
the score. No one seemed worried
when Pinion's place-kick missed.
Score: 19-0.
INTERCEPTED PASS
That was all for the first half. The
Jayseers threatened momentarily at
ihe start of the second when Nor
ton intercepted Papoose Frank
Forbes' pass on the frosh 45. But
end Bill Wilson got the ball back
for the frosh and paved the way for
Fawcett's touchdown dash by i*e
covering a backfield fumble on the
49.
After an ofTside penalty, Fawcett
went out on a wide flanker, took a
lateral from Forbes, and went all
the way with the aid of some beau
tiful downfield blocks. That made
it 25-0.

The fifth Card score followed
Forbes' 11-yard punt return to the
J. C. 29. Mitchell then passed 16
yards to Forbes, who outran the
secondary to the goal line. Jim
Ellis' kick hit the crossbar—3l-0,
The frosh wound up the afternoon
in the following manner. Leland
Scott returned a punt 36 yards to
the Chaffey 27. Two running plays
gained but four, so Bob Koch passed
to Doyle Coldiron on the 6. A pass
was incomplete, Koch got one at
right tackle, and then Scott went
through the same spot for the
touchdown. Coldiron made the
extra point good. Final score:
Stanford Frosh 38, Chaffey 0.
