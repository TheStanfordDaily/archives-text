# Card Soccer Team Shades Ucla Kickers
## 
### 
Although handicapped by the loss
of two stellar veterans, Stanford's
soccer squad nabbed a close deci
sion from Ucla, 3-2, in Los Angeles
| Saturday morning.
Coach Harry Maloney's outfit
' found the Uclans greatly improved,
j and the absence of Fernando Eleta,
I center forward, and Dick Harman,
left back, left two key positions in
: the front line to be filled by men
with less playing experience.
Teller Weinmann, outside left, Joe
MacHarg, inside left, and George
Dole, inside right, scored for the In
dians. The Bruins had the same
| eleven men as were on the 1939
; club, giving them a smooth-playing
J forward combination. But Stanford
had the scoring punch that counted
in the victory.
The Cards' defensive play also
I showed up well, with all 20 players
j getting in.
Next Saturday Stanford takes on
; powerful San Jose State here at
10:30 o'clock. Harman and Eleta will
be on hand for the game and Ma
! loney hopes to bring in another
I scalp to the already imposing vic
! Tory string.
