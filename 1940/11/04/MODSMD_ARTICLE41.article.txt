### 
CHICAGO. Nov. 3 (UP). â€”Chi-
cago's powerhouse Bears throttled
three desperate fourth period rallies
by the Green Beiy Packers today and
routed virtually the Packers' last
hope for another world professional
football championship with a 14 to 7
victory before the largest crowd
ever to see a pro game in Chicago.
