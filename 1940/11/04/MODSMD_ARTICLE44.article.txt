NEW YON k. Nov. 3 (UP). â€”
Moving into the football stretch,
an even dozen major college teams
remained today with perfect rec
ords after a week-end in which
four more unbeaten and untied
elevens were humbled, Notre
Dame was challenged amazingly,
and Minnesota escaped by a one
point margin.
Northwestern, Navy, Detroit and
Clemson had their records shat
tered. This left in the "perfect"
brackets only Cornell. Boston Col
lege, Georgetown, Penn State, La
fayette and Franklin-Marshall in
the East; Minnesota, Michigan and
Notre Dame in the Midwest; Ten
nessee in the South: Texas Aggies
in the Southwest; and Stanford on
the Pacific Coast.
While the season's largest crowd
of 78,000 fans looked on in amaze
ment at Yankee Stadium, Notre
Dame was extended to the limit to
squeeze out a 7-0 victory over an
underdog Army eleven that regis
tered 16 first downs to the "Irish"
four, completed six forward passes
to one, and gathered much more
net yardage.
At Evanston, 111., 49,000 spectators
saw Minnesota blast Northwestern's
perfect record, 13-12, by the kick of
second stringer Joe Mernik who was
called from the bench after Minne
sota's first touchdown.
