# A 						Straw in the Wind
## 
### 
NO one was amazed at the outcome of Thurs
day's straw vote. Before Stanford stopped
along the Quad to mark an "X" after its favorite
candidate's name, the results were already
pretty certain.
Not even the most ardent Democrat supposed
that suddenly and miraculously the Farm might
shrug off its cloak of staunch Republicanism
and hop to the New Deal cause. In the six
Presidential straw votes held on campus the
Republicans have triumphed five times. In the
Stanford ballot of 1912 Wilson defeated Roose
velt and Taft. But that was the only time that the
Democrats have been able to break through the
gates at the end of Palm Drive.
One gratifying result of the balloting was its
substantiation of The Daily's cross-sectional
sampling, conducted earlier this quarter by
Herm Silverman. Thursday's mass vote indi
cated a deviation of only 4 per cent from the
previous public opinion survey of the Farm.
All of these moderately irrelevant facts are
simply so much useless addenda to the really
important part of the ballotâ€”the two questions
about the third term issue and the foreign policy
controversy.
An evaluation of the figures shows that Stan
ford professors, if it were not for the third term
question, would favor Roosevelt over Willkie.
On the other hand, undergraduates were not
appreciably affected by the third term debate.
They very clearly would not back Roosevelt if
it were his first or second attempt at gaining the
Presidency. This is a fairly surprising summa
tion. The Farm's older voters, influenced either
by tradition or by a larger store of experience
which teaches them to avoid a supposed "con
centration of power," are voting against a third
term more positively than they are voting /or
Wendell Willkie.
Undergraduate Stanford is not much im
pressed with the third term arguments, prefers
to favor Willkie rather than oppose Roosevelt's
breach of tradition.
Among students the war in Europe gained
some votes for Roosevelt, while it failed to
affect the vote of professors to any great degree.
This twisted alignment implies, somehow, that
the war is of greater importance to Stanford
students than the third term bickering, while
the opposite statement would represent the atti
tude of Stanford's faculty. The war dictates their
political attitude less definitely than does the
third term.
If it is possible to make any clear evaluation
of the trend of voting according to age and
in University, the results might be vaguely en
couraging for Mr. Roosevelt. Lower Division
students favored Willkie more strongly than
Upper Division men and women. And'gradu
ates seemed less inclined than any other group
to back the Republican candidates. This seems
to indicate that, with each liberalizing year at
college, students favored New Deal measures
and men more clearly.
Whatever this confused pattern may mean,
it will all be nicely washed away by tomorrow's
voting and by next week no one will remember
exactly what Stanford's few hundred straw bal
lots totaled.
