# God Bless Kate Smith

### 
THE movies have been here to stay for some
years, but a new type of feature apparently
is outdrawing Donald Duck and Popeye as a
between-the-acts bit of entertainment.
Hitch-hike into Paly for your favorite screen
bill, ride down to San Jose for the flickers or
journey to the City for your entertainment and
you'll find the same features present. And while
they are comparatively newcomers to the
screen, they have the extended runs of a Garbo
or a Gable.
The new stars are silver-voiced Kate Smith,
the American Flag, and various spots of beauty
and refinement in which our nation abounds.
Here and now let it be said that our Flag is
the most inspiring of all pennants; that this
country of ours is the modern realization of
Pangloss' "best of all possible worlds"; that Kate
Smith is the only one of the three open to ques
tion.
But let it also be added that no one likes to
have this sort of education stuffed down his
gullet.
Seeing the American fleet, various cavalry
tioops riding over the hills into the setting sun
arid the Battle of Bunker Hill in technicolor sand
wiched between various and sundry Mickey
Mice, the newsreels and the local advertising
guide smacks of rank commercialism.

The red, white and blue of Old Glory is a
most inspiring sight to Americans from Maine
to California. Sliding down a spidery pole as
a bugle whispers "Taps" puts it in a perfect
setting. Transpose it to the screen of a theater
between a tobacco ad and next week's bill and
the thrill is missing.
It's like the thrill of watching the neighbor's
baby playing in its crib as compared to holding
the brat down in a box at the opera.
There's a place, and a time, for everything.
We of 1940 America know that outside forces
may be pressing upon the bulwark of cherished
democracy. We know that somewhere men are
fighting the fight of death. We see it in our
news columns and hear it over our radios. But
we hate to see Hollywood waving it in our faces.
We hate to see it gradually impinging on the
advertisement of the local laundry.â€”W. C.
