IT'S A PRESIDENTIAL PHOTO-FINISH
so ends the bloody week-end down in the
Southland. Did you have a good time Saturday
night.' Now it s a quick welcome back to the Farm
again, for those of you who found it in your hearts
and pocketbooks to leave the Farm for the pleasures at
U.C.L.A. And now on to the more pressing business
of the day—or, rather, tomorrow.
* * * *
Tomorrow, as if you could forget it, is the big day
when all good ward-heelers get together and drag
gray-haired old ladies by their old gray hair down to
the nearest polling booth to vote for the "right"
candidate.
Tomorrow is presidential election day.
Tomorrow you will have to scrape political mud
out of your newspaper for the last time. Tomorrow
for the last time. Tomorrow for the last time you
will read about the WPA worker who threw eggs at
Willkie an dthe Young Republican who threw onions
back at Roosevelt. By now you must be getting
awfully tired of going to rallies with "the boys."
Picking the winner of the election is a pretty tough
job. In fact, it is impossible, and, if all you English
instructors will permit, it is becoming more impossible
the nearer we get to that fateful deadline.
The Gallup Poll shows this fact very clearly. Of
course you may not be a believer in polls, but the
Gallup boys have a nasty habit of being nastily accu
rate in calling the winners. And according to them
Roosevelt is dropping votes faster than Jackie Robin
son chasing Clyde Jeffrey.
About a week ago, President "Youa Freenn" Roose
velt had about 56 per cent of you voters in his Demo
cratic bag. Fifty-six per cent of the total vote leaves
a not-so-fat 44 per cent for Wendell "If you elec me
prezzdent Uni' States" Willkie.
\ in *
r JpiIAT gives Roosevelt al2 per cent lead—or have
you figured that out already?
But that was last week. A couple of days ago the
redhot Gallup boys whipped out another presidential
poll, just to show that they really an' truly know
that there is a presidential election in the offing. This
later poll showed that Roosevelt had dropped to only
about 53 per cent of the total vote. In short, his 12
per cent lead over Willkie had been cut in half.
Now it is a couple of days later. Maybe by now
Roosevelt isn't in the lead any more. Tomorrow we
will know.

QNE thing is certain. Probably a greater percentage
of the United States will vote in this election
than have ever voted before. Things are as tied-up
as the Wilson-Hughes election.
Today, every citizen, you, and you, and you, are
hyper-conscious of the issues, both national and inter
national, which we MUST face and which our President
(forever or to-be?) MUST face. Now, people more
than ever want a voice in what is rushing on. Hence
they will get out and vote.
So rest assured, if you vote for him, YOUR can
didate will be elected.
