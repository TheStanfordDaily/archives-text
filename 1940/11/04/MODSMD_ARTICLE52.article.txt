## BOWL-BOUND?

EDITOR, SIR:
Nowadays, wherever you go, you hear talk of
Stanford going to the Rose Bowl. At the football
games, in the Quad, at rallies, and all around the cam
pus, the subject of the Rose Bowl comes up. The
present time is not the time to be considering this
subject, as football season is really just getting started,
and some of the toughest games Stanford will ever
have this season lie before her.
The Washington game won't be a pushover, and
Cal is gunning to beat us even if she doesn't win an
other game all season. This isn't the time for "Rose
Bowl Talk."
Let me tell you what is slowly and surely hap
pening to Stanford. A state of over-confidence is
slowly creeping over her as the Great Cardinal team
piles up the scores. Knute Rockne once said that the
greatest menace to a winning football team is over
confidence, and he was telling the truth.
Over-confidence has made greater teams than ours
lose to small schools. Now we all realize that Stan
ford has the best, team on the Coast, but it is the
fact of knowing it-that may result in disaster.
It would be a wonderful thing if Stanford did go
to the Rose Bowl, but realize the fact that there are
other teams in the country who are trying just as
hard to get to the Rose Bowl as we are. Let's cut the
talk of Rose Bowl to a later date. In the meantime
let's get back of our team in a conscientious manner
and push them on to victory.
