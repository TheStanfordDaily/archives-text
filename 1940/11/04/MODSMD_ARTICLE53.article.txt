# TOLERANCE FOR ALL
## 
### 
THE EDITOR. SIR:
While casting my ballot in the straw vote this
morning I noted something which may seem insig
nificant but which, nevertheless, smacks of intoler
ance and discourtesy. Namely, that the Democratic
candidates on the ballot had been shunted down the
list to a cellar position below that of the Communist
party. Maybe I'm mistaken but it was my belief that
the party in power traditionally assumes the first
place on the ballot.
Perhaps, since the campus is without a doubt Re
publican, it was thus arranged to facilitate fast, effi
cient voting between classes for the majority. But
how about the poor Democrat (yes, there are a few
around) who must search diligently until he finally
finds his standard at. the bottom of the heap. Un
sporting I calls it. Being a died-in-the-wool Free
Soiler myself, I don't write this to vent my hurt feel
ings but merely as a reminder that tolerance and
courtesy are two prime requisites of an educated
person.
Sincerely,
D. B.
