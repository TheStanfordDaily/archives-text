# Sayao, Schipa Close Series With 'Manon'
## 
### 
The intimacy of subject matter
and the sympathy between the music
and language of the French lyric
opera were displayed Friday night
in the San Francisco Opera Com
pany's performance of Massenet's
"Manon" by an all-around excel
lent cast.
Bidu Sayao again showed her fit
ness for the role of the petite Manon
with her charming, never overly
acted manner and her full but light
voice. Few singers are so suited to
bring out the intimate character of
Manon.
TITO IS GOOD
Tito Schipa as the Chevalier des
Grieux brought all the emotion and
power of his experienced voice to
the role, although his acting was not
up to his singing. The supporting
cast, headed by John Brownlee as
Lescaut, were equal to the stand
ards of Sayao and Schipa.
Lorenzo Alvary was the dignified,
venerable Count des Grieux, im
pressing the audience with both his
voice and manner. Alessio de Paolis
was the old roue, Guillot Morfon
taine, George Cehanovsky was De-
Gretigny, and Margaret Ritter, Rob
ert Ballagh, and Stanley Noonan
completed the cast.
CHORUS EFFECTIVE
Merola conducted and the stage
direction was under Armando Ag
nini. The chorus was particularly

effective, especially with Sayao in
her gavotte and aria in the fourth
act.
"Manon" completed the list of
operas given by the San Francisco
company in its eighteenth season, a
season successful with its well bal
anced casts and highlighted by the
San Francisco premiere of "Der
Rosenkavalier." The curtain went
down the last time for 1940 Satur
day night after a repeat performance
of "Carmen."
