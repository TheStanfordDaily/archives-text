The Daily today publishes the answers to last week's nine objective ;
questions in the "Know Stanford" contest together with the side-lights 1
that make them interesting.
The oldest national women's Greek-letter fraternity, Kappa Alpha
Theta, was also the first fraternity to found a chapter at Senator and Mrs.

Stanford's new Western
This was in 1892.
A little over 48 years ago, on April
24, 1892, the first pajamarino was
held. On that day Stanford's var
sity baseball team beat Cal for the
first time. The students went wild
and a horde of men swarmed over
Ihe campus in their night shirts,
ending up with an impromptu sere
nade to the women in old Roble
(now Sequoia). Pajamas were later
substituted for night shirts, and the
tradition was reserved to the U.S.C.
rally.
There is some question as to just
what type of architecture the Uni
versity buildings really are, but ac
cording to the architect's avowed
intentions it is an adaptation of the
Spanish Mission design.
Lcland Stanford Jr.'s middle name

was DeWitt. He disliked the name
violently, and for that reason it
was never used.
As the University is a memorial
to the Stanfords' son, Mrs. Stanford
asked that the number of women
never exceed the number of men.
The famed "500" limit was her origi
nal stipulation.
Tom Irwin, editor of the Daily
Palo Alto (now the Stanford Daily)
led the fight to stop so-called
"freshman discipline." From the
founding of the school until Feb
ruary 1923, the practice of hazing
freshman men was rooted in Stan
ford tradition, although it was
against University rules.
SOPIIS DISCIPLINED
At that time all non-fraternity
men lived in Encina. Sophomores
living in the hall handled the "dis
ciplining," and all plans were kept
secret. Perhaps the most dangerous
part of the hazing routine was
"tubbing." The frosh were routed
out of bed at any time of the night
by masked sophomores, and walked
to Mayfield in their pajamas. That
they were paddled, and paddled
hard, is of course taken for granted.
The freshmen were "tubbed" at
the horse trough in Mayfield. The
method was to shove the man under
water and hit him in the stomach—
|he was usually removed uncon
scious. After he was revived, he
walked back to Encina, dripping
wet, his lungs full of water, in his
pajamas.
Many of the men who entered
Stanford immediately after the war
had been overseas in active service.
Hazihg, to them, was not only child
ish. but intolerable. Among these
was Tom Irwin, '23.
"They never touched me," Mr.
I Irwin, now head of public relations
| for San Francisco's public utilities,
said in an interview last week, "but
they got almost all of my friends. I
said then, when I was a freshman,
that I was going to stop it—if I
could."
Mr. Irwin began an editorial cam
| paign against hazing as soon as he
| took the office of Daily editor in
the fall of 1922. Things came to a
| head at the very end of his term
in February of '23.
Four men, Mr. Irwin, his brother
Jake, Cecil Marquis, and Beverly
Baillard, who lived in Encina, got
wind that a hazing party was sched
uled for a certain evening and
posted themselves in front of Encina
to await developments.
