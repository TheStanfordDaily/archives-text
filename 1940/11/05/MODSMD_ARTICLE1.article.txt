### BOB LOW 
LECTIONS in the United States
have known extreme bitterness.
As election day approaches every
four years, observers express the
notion that "this is the dirtiest elec
tion in years." Again this year this
expression has found its way into
newspapers all over the country.
But this isn't the first time that
eggs have been thrown at a Presi
dential candidate. In fact, there is
no historical basis for assuming that
we have been in the midst of the
"dirtiest campaign ever."
Many times in the past, the same
political mud-slinging has been seen.
Jackson was called a dictator, and
his opponents claimed he wished to
be king. Jefferson, Lincoln, Wilson
and all the others were attacked by
the opposition. And this is the im
portant thing—they are attacked by
the opposition and there was no at
tempt at suppression.
Only once in the history of this
country has there been any at
tempt on the part of the admin
istration in power to muzzle criti
cism of the government and its
officers. But this attempt was
short-lived and the Alien and Se
dition gag rules were thrown out
once and for all in the first dec
ade of the 19th century.
* * *
and criticism are a part
of our democratic system. There
is no alternative if representative
government is to go on.
The people must be informed of
the activities of their representa
tives, and no man can say where
the just limit of this criticism shall
be. So in a democratic system of
government there is no limit to crit
icism. The people are the judges of
the validity of conflicting claims.
Only greater education and
greater interest on the part of an
increasingly larger portion of the
population can make democracy
continue to progress in the face of
totalitarian competition. To believe
in Democracy is to believe in the
will of the majority of the people,
and increased confidence in the ma
jority must be strengthened by in
creased education and increased in
terest in the affairs of government.
So when the election returns are
tabulated today and tomorrow, real
believers in Democracy will show
their colors. They will express con
fidence in our system regardless of
election outcome.
But the poor loser today and to
morrow. whether Democrat or
Republican, is the person who has
lost faith in the American people,
lie is the one who will accept a
system in which there is no criti
cism, no attack from the opposi
tion. and no chance for the people
to demonstrate their alleged "lack
of ability to govern themselves"
at regular elections.

T HE past political campaign has
known extreme bitterness. The
issues have been obscured by gen
eralities and mud-slinging from both
camps perhaps because the candi
dates themselves have differed so
little in their announced aims. Ob
servers looking on from a foreign
country might have difficulty in
determining points of variance.
Whether or not the President is
re-elected is of relatively small
consequence for the person who
will fight for the right to disagree—
and, most important, for the right of
those with whom he disagrees to
express their views.
If the present administration is
replaced by another in January,
Roosevelt's supporters of today will
have the privilege of attacking the
new Republican administration. And
if Roosevelt is returned to the
White House the Republican oppo
sition will go on attacking the
Roosevelt administration.
Democracy is not threatened, then,
except by those who will abandon
their belief in the right to disagree.
Democracy will not come to an end
because Roosevelt is elected or be
cause Willkie is elected. It will be
undermined by those who express
frankly a belief that the "people
don't know what's good for them"
after today's election.

believers in Democracy will show
their colors. They will express con
fidence in our system regardless of
election outcome.
But the poor loser today and to
morrow. whether Democrat or
Republican, is the person who has
lost faith in the American people,
lie is the one who will accept a
system in which there is no criti
cism, no attack from the opposi
tion. and no chance for the people
to demonstrate their alleged "lack
of ability to govern themselves"
at regular elections.

T HE past political campaign has
known extreme bitterness. The
issues have been obscured by gen
eralities and mud-slinging from both
camps perhaps because the candi
dates themselves have differed so
little in their announced aims. Ob
servers looking on from a foreign
country might have difficulty in
determining points of variance.
Whether or not the President is
re-elected is of relatively small
consequence for the person who
will fight for the right to disagree—
and, most important, for the right of
those with whom he disagrees to
express their views.
If the present administration is
replaced by another in January,
Roosevelt's supporters of today will
have the privilege of attacking the
new Republican administration. And
if Roosevelt is returned to the
White House the Republican oppo
sition will go on attacking the
Roosevelt administration.
Democracy is not threatened, then,
except by those who will abandon
their belief in the right to disagree.
Democracy will not come to an end
because Roosevelt is elected or be
cause Willkie is elected. It will be
undermined by those who express
frankly a belief that the "people
don't know what's good for them"
after today's election.
LECTIONS in the United States
have known extreme bitterness.
As election day approaches every
four years, observers express the
notion that "this is the dirtiest elec
tion in years." Again this year this
expression has found its way into
newspapers all over the country.
But this isn't the first time that
eggs have been thrown at a Presi
dential candidate. In fact, there is
no historical basis for assuming that
we have been in the midst of the
"dirtiest campaign ever."
Many times in the past, the same
political mud-slinging has been seen.
Jackson was called a dictator, and
his opponents claimed he wished to
be king. Jefferson, Lincoln, Wilson
and all the others were attacked by
the opposition. And this is the im
portant thing—they are attacked by
the opposition and there was no at
tempt at suppression.
Only once in the history of this
country has there been any at
tempt on the part of the admin
istration in power to muzzle criti
cism of the government and its
officers. But this attempt was
short-lived and the Alien and Se
dition gag rules were thrown out
once and for all in the first dec
ade of the 19th century.

is no alternative if representative
government is to go on.
The people must be informed of
