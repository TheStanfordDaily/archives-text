SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 4 (UP).
â€”Americans are a lazy people "who
want to do things with the least
possible mental effort," H. G. Wells,
noted British writer, said today.
Asserting the United States has
"too much party and class conflict."
Wells said Britain didn't want
America to come into war because I
'we don't think the United States is
1 sufficiently united."
