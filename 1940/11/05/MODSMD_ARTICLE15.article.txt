It is in the cards that two Stan
forditcs will be lucky today at
lft o'clock when the hand of Fate,
disguised as a sophomore, tosses
Iftft pieces of candy all carefully
wrapped (so you can't lose) out
of an upper story window of the
English Corner.
Inside two of the pieccs of candy
there will be a free bid to the
Sophomore Cotillion. Nobody
should fail to pick up a piece of
candy if he sees one, for he may
be the lucky winner.
