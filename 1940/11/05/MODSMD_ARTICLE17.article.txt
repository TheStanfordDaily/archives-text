# Latest Polls Give Margin To New Deal
## Republicans Need 'Big Four' Electoral Votes for Triumph 
### 
NEW YORK. Nov. 4 (UP).
—The tumultous 1940 national
political campaign ended to
night, and tomorrow some 50,-
000,000 Americans will decide
what may be the closest White
House race since 1916 when
Woodrow Wilson, inched out
bewhiskercd Charles Evan*
Hughes.
Last-minute polls and oilier sur
veys gave President Roosevelt a
slight hump on the popular vote.
They agreed, generally, too, Wen
dell L. Willkie must win the elec
toral votes of the "big four" states—
New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois
and Ohio—if he is to triumph.
Final moments of the hot drive
for the nation's top honor found both
candidates active.
Tomorrow night Willkie will listen
to the voice of the people through
the ballot at his headquarters in
the Commodore Hotel. Secret serv
ice officials already have placed in
motion machinery to guard his life
in the event he triumphs.
F.D.R. AT HOME
President. Roosevelt will receive
the election returns at bus Hyde
Park, N.Y., home in the company of
a group of intimate friends.

Republicans lacked 51 seats of a
hair-line majority in the House after
the 1938 Congressional elections.
They were able, through a union
with anti-New Deal Democrats not
only to turn aside Administration
proposals but to jam through meas
ures obnoxious to the President.
These included the Smith amend
ments to the Wagner Labor Act and
legislation calling for court review
of rulings by quasi-judicial federal
agencies.
DEMOS KEEP SENATE
Both measures were blocked by
the Senate, which will remain Dem
ocratic regardless of tomorrow's
balloting.
Present membership of the House
is Democrats, 259; Republicans, 167;
Farmer-Labor, 1; Progressive, 2;
and five vacancies. All scats arc at
stake.
Present membership of the Sen
ate is Democrats, (19; Republicans,
25; Progressives, 1; and Independ
ent, 1. Up for re-election are
Democrats, 25; Republicans, 10; and
one Progressive.
The ultimate complexion of the
House may be influenced by the
splintering of party lines in the tor
rid race for the White House. They
cracked like match sticks under th<*
blow of a third-term nomination
and the Democratic selection of
Henry A. Wallacc, former Repub
lican, as Mr. Roosevelt's running
mate; under the Republican conven
tion choice of Willkie, who was a
Democrat as late as 1932 and as the
President's forcig7i affairs and na
tional defense policies bloomed as
campaign issues.

Farmer-Labor, 1; Progressive, 2;
and five vacancies. All scats arc at
stake.
Present membership of the Sen
ate is Democrats, (19; Republicans,
25; Progressives, 1; and Independ
ent, 1. Up for re-election are

one Progressive.
The ultimate complexion of the
House may be influenced by the
splintering of party lines in the tor
rid race for the White House. They
cracked like match sticks under th<*
blow of a third-term nomination
and the Democratic selection of
Henry A. Wallacc, former Repub
lican, as Mr. Roosevelt's running
mate; under the Republican conven
tion choice of Willkie, who was a
Democrat as late as 1932 and as the
President's forcig7i affairs and na
tional defense policies bloomed as
campaign issues.
NEW YORK. Nov. 4 (UP).
—The tumultous 1940 national
political campaign ended to
night, and tomorrow some 50,-
000,000 Americans will decide
what may be the closest White
House race since 1916 when
Woodrow Wilson, inched out
bewhiskercd Charles Evan*
Hughes.
Last-minute polls and oilier sur
veys gave President Roosevelt a
slight hump on the popular vote.
They agreed, generally, too, Wen
dell L. Willkie must win the elec
toral votes of the "big four" states—
New York, Pennsylvania, Illinois
and Ohio—if he is to triumph.
Final moments of the hot drive
for the nation's top honor found both
candidates active.
Tomorrow night Willkie will listen
to the voice of the people through
the ballot at his headquarters in
the Commodore Hotel. Secret serv
ice officials already have placed in
motion machinery to guard his life
in the event he triumphs.
F.D.R. AT HOME
President. Roosevelt will receive
the election returns at bus Hyde
Park, N.Y., home in the company of
a group of intimate friends.

Republicans lacked 51 seats of a
hair-line majority in the House after
the 1938 Congressional elections.
They were able, through a union
with anti-New Deal Democrats not
only to turn aside Administration
proposals but to jam through meas
ures obnoxious to the President.
These included the Smith amend
ments to the Wagner Labor Act and
legislation calling for court review
of rulings by quasi-judicial federal
agencies.
