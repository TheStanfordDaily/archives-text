Walter Bruce is a paradox.
You'd never guess it by liis name, but Walter Bruce is a Latin-Ameri
can, a Chilean to be exact. ,
This handsome Latin from south «tf Panama, the gentleman with the
skillfully clipped moustachio. the large, intelligent eyes, and the slightly

receding forehead, is Stanford's#
guest from the Ciitholie University
in Santiago.
Winner of the Tarver Interfrater
nity exchange scholarship, estab
lished in the memory of Bruce Tar
ver, Lloyd Wilson, Theta Delt, is
studying at the Catholic University
this year, while Bruce is attending
Stanford.
SCOTCH, LATIN BLOOD
About that paradox. Bruce ex
plains away the unusual combina- j
lion of Anglo-Saxon surname and j
swarthy complexion as the result of j
bis grandfather's marriage. His i
grandfather, a Scottish officer on a
British man-o'-war visiting in
Chile, married his grandmother, a
Chilean, and settled in Chile.
Up there on the dresser in
Bruce's room in the Theta Delt |
house, you notice —as a matter of j
fact, you can't help but notice—the
charming picture of a sulty senorita.
Walter's property.
On it is inscribed, "Con todo ca
rino a mi pichoto." Bruce tries to
explain it away, "It doesn't mean
love, but more or less love."
FROM CATHOLIC COLLEGE
Bruce, a graduate of the Catholic ;
University in '37, is mixing one part
of civil engineer major and one part !
Graduate School of Business during
his three quarters on the Farm.
The whole concoction is flavored ;
with a not over prolific knowledge j
of English, although he speaks it
rather fluently.
But, he complains, "English is i
hard for me. First I must under- I
si'and my professors, then take notes, I
which are a combination of Spanish [
;t rid English, then write my reports !
in Spanish, and then translate them j
into English."
Back to that girl friend on the |
dresser. At mention of her name, j
he smiled a Latin smile, and sighed
in the South American way, "Some
(i nes I hear from her more than one
tines a week. But then the boys
ii the house get dates for me, and j
help me to forget her."
