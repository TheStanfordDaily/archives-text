# United Airliner Crash Kills 10
## Plane Strikes Peak As Radio Beam Fails 
### 
A United Airlines Mainliner J
crashed on Bountiful Peak in the I
Wasatch Mountains killing ten per- |
sons this morning.
The plane, which left San Fran- :
ciseo last night bound for New York, j
apparently struck the mountain I
about 5 a.m., 16 minutes after Pilot
Howard Fey reported to the Salt '<
Lake Airport, 10 miles southwest of j
Bountiful Peak, he was going to
try to pierce fog layers and come
in for a landing.
RADIO BEAM FAILS
Failure of the radio beam Fey j
was using for his instrument land- [
ing was given as the probable cause ;
of the crash by C. V. Hall, United
Air Lines vice-president in charge j
of operations. Hall said only half
the regular navigation signal was |
coming through and this would
probably lead Fey into the moun- j
tains.
Wreckage of the plane was sighted '
from the air shortly before noon, j
but it was not until hours later that j
a ground party, trudging through !
eight inches of heavy, wet snow and
up the steep mountainside, reached
the scene.
BODIES MANGLED
First to reach the wreck on foot '
was a party led by Dick Sperry of
Salt Lake City. He said the bodies j
of Fey and Sandegren were found
in front of the plane. They had
been hurled through the windshield
a.s the ship struck the mountain with I
terrific force.
The other bodies, horribly man- '
gled, were inside the cabin. All 10
apparently died instantly.
The twin engines of the craft were j
driven through the wings. One wing i
was lipped off. The fuselage was
broken in two.
The plane hit the peak at the
height of the first full-fledged snow- i
storm of the winter in this area. It
had been snowing since yesterday j
morning. Temperatures aloft were
below zero. Other pilots said a
strong wind was blowing.

RADIO BEAM FAILS
Failure of the radio beam Fey j
was using for his instrument land- [
ing was given as the probable cause ;
of the crash by C. V. Hall, United
Air Lines vice-president in charge j
of operations. Hall said only half
the regular navigation signal was |
coming through and this would
probably lead Fey into the moun- j
tains.
Wreckage of the plane was sighted '
from the air shortly before noon, j
but it was not until hours later that j
a ground party, trudging through !
eight inches of heavy, wet snow and
up the steep mountainside, reached
the scene.
BODIES MANGLED
First to reach the wreck on foot '
was a party led by Dick Sperry of
Salt Lake City. He said the bodies j
of Fey and Sandegren were found
in front of the plane. They had
been hurled through the windshield
a.s the ship struck the mountain with I
terrific force.
The other bodies, horribly man- '
gled, were inside the cabin. All 10
apparently died instantly.
The twin engines of the craft were j
driven through the wings. One wing i
was lipped off. The fuselage was
broken in two.
The plane hit the peak at the
height of the first full-fledged snow- i
storm of the winter in this area. It
had been snowing since yesterday j
morning. Temperatures aloft were
below zero. Other pilots said a
strong wind was blowing.
