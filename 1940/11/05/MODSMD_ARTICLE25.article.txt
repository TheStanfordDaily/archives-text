# GREEK-ITALIAN BATTLE GROWS ON MAIN FRONT
## 
### 
ATHENS, Nov. 4 (UP). —Main
bodies of the Greek and Italian ar
mies have clashed and a large-scale
battle is developing, late reports
from the front stated tonight.
The British air force was taking
part (presumably operating from
Greek territory) by heavy bombing
attacks on the Italian east coast ports
of Bari, Brindisi and Santa Qua
ranta where men and munitions
destined for Greece were massed.
TANKS REPULSED
Earlier dispatches said that Greek
forces had repulsed a heavy Italian
assault with tanks in the Epirus
sector and had pushed closer to the
Italian invasion base of Koritza in
Albania.
Italian aviation heavily bombed
Greek front positions—apparently in
preparation for the present big bat
tle—and ranged far into the Greek
interior.
British naval forces, including the
escort vessel H.M.S. Wryneck and
the minesweeper H.M.S. Fareham,
arrived at Piraeus, the port of Ath
ens, yesterday.
