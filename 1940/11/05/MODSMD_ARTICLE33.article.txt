### JERRY BRUCKER 
JVORM STANDLEE got a vote for
All-American from Hnp-
I'cll, coach of the U.C.LA. Bruins.
After watching The Chief tear up
the dirt of the Coliseum, Horrell said
that the big Stanford fullback was
better than John Kimbrough, the
wonder man of Texas A. & M. Most
of the members of the Bruin team
concurred.
The general opinion was that
Norm was a faster power runner
and kept his feet better than the
star of the Southwest.
If the Indians can scalp the Hus
kies in the stadium Saturday and
squeak by the remaining two games
on their schedule, fans in the Rose
Bowl may witness these two great
backs in action.
The only drawback is that most
All-Americans are chosen around
the middle of December, and one
of the boys will be left pretty well
out in the cold. The other, if the
Aggies and the Indians do meet in
Pasadena, will have a tough time
proving his superiority.
Vic Lindskog. who may miss the
Washington game because of a
had hand, is being mentioned as a
possible All-Coast center. Rudy
Mucha of Washington was boomed
fur the spot when the season
started, but according to all re
ports he hasn't lived up to ex
pectations this year.
Lindskog has played sound foot
ball in every game this year. Never
flashy, he has been one of the best
defensive linemen on the field in
every game the Indians have pla3'ed.
He has only one fault, his passes on
punt formations have a tendency to
be inaccurate.
Lindskog never played center be
fore this fall; perhaps by next year
he'll be in the running for All-
American.

IV! Y nomination for outstanding !
players in the Ucla tilt go not to
the stars who were applauded when
they left the field, as Hugh Gallar
neau, Norm Standlee, Jackie Rob
inson, and Frankie Albert, respec
tively, but to a couple of boys no- !
body else seems to have noticed.
They are Ken Robesky and Ed
Stain ni.
Filling in for a couple of injured
regulars, these two performed so
well {hat the team functioned just
as though Jack Warnecke and
Chuck Taylor were not sitting on
the bench.
Robesky played a good part of the
game in the Bruin backfield. Ken
knifed through several times to spill
Uclans as soon as they got the ball.
He's also a ball hawk, having re
covered two fumbles now in as
many games.
Stamm was not sensational, and
made a few mistakes, but played a
steady, dependable game most of
the time. With a little more ex
perience he might develop into
the best tackle on the squad.
It makes the experts who said that
Stanford would be very weak in line
reserves look pretty funny. I don't
know whether the credit for the de
velopment of these men should go
to Clark Shaughnessy, Line Coach
Phil Bengtson, or to the players
themselves, but a combination of
the three factors has given Stan
ford as good a forward wall as
the one that made the Vow Boys
click.

Lucky Louie almost hit the
jackpot this week. The great Ca
nadian middle man caught nine
out of ten to boost his average for
the year to .805 per cent.
