# Undefeated Papoose Gridders Shape Offense for Cal Game
## 
### 
Five down, one to go. That's the story of the undefeated, untied Stan
ford frosh football team as it gets set for the final big push of the season
this week.
Hard work and plenty of it will he the theme of the workouts
today through Thursday as the Papoose gridders prepare for their most

important engagement of the sea-,
son, the Little Big Game, which
comes off Saturday in Memorial
Stadium at Berkeley.
Following his charges' victory
over Chaffey J. C. last Saturday,
Frosh Coach Harry Shipkey enter
tained 42 freshman footballers at
Sunday dinner at his home, at
which time the team elected Loren
LaPrade, center, and Bob Koch,
right halfback, co-captains for the
California frosh game as well as
honorary captains for the season.
KENWARD INJURED
The only serious injury to a Stan
ford frosh gridder Saturday was
sustained by Quarterback Johnny
Kenward, who has a hip pointer.
But he is expected to be in shape
for this week-end's contest. Other
wise the outfit is in fine fettle, both
physically and mentally, for the
game that can determine whether
the Papooses' season is successful or
only mediocre.
Despite the large score they ran
up, Shipkey does not f«el that his
boys were very consistent offens
ively last Saturday.
'•They went in spurts too much,"
declared the big frosh mentor. "But
defensively they played exception
ally well against ground plays, es
pecially when they held Chaffey for
downs when the latter was threat
ening to score from the four-yard
line."
SHIPKEY WORRIED
But the fact that ihe junior col
lege gridders completed a good
number of passes right over center
is giving Shipkey quite a bit of
worry.
Cal uses that pass down the
middle a lot, and it's a dangerous
weapon," he said.
Yesterday's drill featured a punt
scrimmage with plenty of body
contact as Shipkey and his aides
gave the boys a lesson on how to
give the punter better protection.
Work on punt coverage was also
included.

included.
Five down, one to go. That's the story of the undefeated, untied Stan
ford frosh football team as it gets set for the final big push of the season
this week.
Hard work and plenty of it will he the theme of the workouts
today through Thursday as the Papoose gridders prepare for their most

important engagement of the sea-,
son, the Little Big Game, which
comes off Saturday in Memorial
Stadium at Berkeley.
Following his charges' victory
over Chaffey J. C. last Saturday,
Frosh Coach Harry Shipkey enter
tained 42 freshman footballers at
Sunday dinner at his home, at
which time the team elected Loren
LaPrade, center, and Bob Koch,
right halfback, co-captains for the
California frosh game as well as
honorary captains for the season.
KENWARD INJURED
The only serious injury to a Stan
ford frosh gridder Saturday was
sustained by Quarterback Johnny
Kenward, who has a hip pointer.
But he is expected to be in shape
for this week-end's contest. Other
wise the outfit is in fine fettle, both
physically and mentally, for the
game that can determine whether
the Papooses' season is successful or
only mediocre.
Despite the large score they ran
up, Shipkey does not f«el that his
boys were very consistent offens
ively last Saturday.
'•They went in spurts too much,"
declared the big frosh mentor. "But
defensively they played exception
ally well against ground plays, es
pecially when they held Chaffey for
downs when the latter was threat
ening to score from the four-yard
line."
SHIPKEY WORRIED
But the fact that ihe junior col
lege gridders completed a good
number of passes right over center
is giving Shipkey quite a bit of
worry.
Cal uses that pass down the
middle a lot, and it's a dangerous
weapon," he said.
Yesterday's drill featured a punt
scrimmage with plenty of body
contact as Shipkey and his aides
gave the boys a lesson on how to
give the punter better protection.
Work on punt coverage was also
included.
