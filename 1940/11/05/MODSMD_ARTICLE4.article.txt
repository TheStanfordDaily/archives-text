# Ski Club Shows Film Thursday
## 
### 
Ski enthusiasts will this week
have an opportunity to learn some
of the sport's finer points when on
Thursday evening the Ski Club
presents Dr. Frank Howard's color
movie, "Ski Maniac," in the Edu
cation Building auditorium.
This movie, according to Prexy
Dave Nottage of the Ski Club, con
cerns the adventures of a young
woman bitten by the "ski bug" and
contains shots of some of the better
skiing recently done in this coun-'
try.
Dr. Howard's reputation as a
color photographer has been firmly
established by former visits to this
vicinity. He is also an excellent
skier and is at the present time
vice-president of the California Ski
Association.
All those interested, in addition to
all past and present members of the
Ski Club, arc invited to attend. Pro
ceeds from the 23-cent admission
will go to the Ski Club.
The movie has been scheduled so
that it will not conflict with the
rally to be held the same night and
will be followed by a meeting of
the Ski Club at which the organi
zation's plans for the coming year
will be revealed.
