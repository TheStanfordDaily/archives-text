# Fireboys Sear El Cuadro, 32-0
## 
### 
The Firchouse gang was red hot
yesterday, crushing EI Cuadro, 152-0.
v\liile the A.T.O.'s dumped the Chi
Psis, G-0. in the only two intra
' mural games played.
"Whippet" Willie Cannon, A.T.O.
fullback, took the Chi Psi opening
[ kickoff on his 20-yard line, picked
lup beautiful blocking down the
] sidelines, cut in toward the middle
| and went for a touchdown without
I a hand being laid on him. The con
version attempt was smeared.
After the second half began it was
iso dark everybody looked like
j Jackie Robinson, but frequent fum
i bles and hard-driving linemen
stopped further scoring. The A.T.O.'s
threatened several times on bril
liant running p'ays but were unable
to tally again.
The Pfyl boysâ€”Frank blocked for
brother Monty, and with the help of
I "Midget" McCloud and Ken Moul
ton, fast-charging center, the Fire
j house gave El Cuadro its worst
I lacing in many'a game.
