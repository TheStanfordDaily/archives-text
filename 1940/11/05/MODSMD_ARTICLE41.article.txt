# Card Eleven Faces Tough Week of Practice Work
## 
### 
In comparison to the full week of rest Washington's Huskies sot last
week, the one day recess from practice C'oacli Clark Sha ugliness.v gave his
Indian first and second stringers yesterday seems rather scant,
Washington, after coasting at half speed through California "-(> :â–  week
ago last Saturday, drew a hye on the day Stanford played their sixth

straight and roughest football game 4
against U.C.L.A. in Los Angeles, i
This means that the Huskies have
had a week of rest and leisurely
work before even starting their
preparations for their titanic game
with Shaughnessy's Warriors.
On the other hand, Stanford, hav- !
inc; gone at full tilt since the begin
ning of the season to hang up their j
undefeated and untied record, will
have to drag themselves together
today after their most bruising game
to launch a campaign against the
only team which stands between \
them and the Rose Bowl.

Though Coach Jimmy Phelan's
men from the north lost their sea- j
son's opener to Minnesota 19-14, they
are right up there with the Cards
as unbeaten and untied on the
Coast. A loss to the Gophers of
j Minnesota is not disgraceful, for
last week these leaders of the Big
Ten established themselves as the
| top eleven in the country, keeping
j thir record clean with a victory
over a formerly unbeaten, untied
Northwestern outfit.
Though the Stanford "Wow Boys"
might be physically wearited by
i their strenuous season to date they
have a good chance of being able to
! start their so-called first string for
the first time since the W.S.C.
game.
LINDSKOG INJURED
Rod Warnecke, Shaughnessy's
I starting tackle in the first four
games, got a day off from active
play last Saturday and now should
be in top shape for the Huskies.
Chuck Taylor, a guard and another
] of Shaughnessy's starting linemen,
i also had a rest over the week-end;
, and the ankle he twisted in the
| U.S.C. game is well on the mend.
The only member of the "doubt
ful starter" list for this coming Sat
urday's crucial game with Washing
ton is first string center Vic Linds
kog. Vic, who likes things plenty
rough and tough, split his hand wide
| open on a stray cleat last Saturday

and may be handicapped by this in
jury at his center position.
It is possible that Vic will be able
to play with his- hand safely en
cased in a cast, and that he will re
linquish his centering duties on punt
formations to either of the guards,
Dick Palmer or Chuck Taylor.
