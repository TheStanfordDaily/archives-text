# We Want Roosevelt
## 
### 
STANFORD has already rather definitely
found its place in the Willkie column.
Whether or not its choice will mirror the na
tional average we'll know tonight. I can say
with all confidence that my words will not
seriously influence one single vote.
They are, at best, a sincere expression, not
flippantly tossed in the faces of the campus'
Republican majority. They constitute the prin
cipal reasons why I shall vote today for Frank
lin D. Roosevelt.
I believe that Wendell Willkie has offered no
constructive program of action. He has failed
during the long months of campaigning to pro
pose any measures which can compare with
the benefits which have accrued to the people
from New Deal legislation.
Wendell Willkie is "all things to all men."
His statements of policy have been conflict
ing and misleading. Either he is hopelessly
confused or deliberately insincere. In New
Haven on Oct. 9 he declared that "the Repub
lican party is the enemy of monopoly." Last
April in Fortune Magazine he said "the Repub
licans started the trend toward concentration
of power."
Speaking at Los Angeles in September, Will
kie stated, "It is my considered opinion that
labor has been the chief sufferer from the poli
cies of the New Deal."
Four days later in Seattle the Republican can
didate declared, "I stand for every one of the
social gains that labor has made. National La
bor Relations Act, free collective bargaining,
minimum wages and maximum hours, social
security benefits, insurance against unemploy
ment, adequate pensions. Now if the New Deal
wants to claim credit for these minimum safe
guards, I say let it have just as much as it
deserves."
If Mr. Willkie actually believes in these and
other measures, all instituted by the Adminis
tration over rather consistent Republican oppo
sition, he stands virtually alone among his party
leaders.
If, too, he sincerely backs most New Deal
legislation he must urge its continuation. His
principal criticism of these enactments lies in
their administration, then, and not their funda
mental construction. It is difficult to see how,
if elected, Willkie might further these laws
when his party stalwarts have sought to kill
them.
Just as Willkie favors the Administration's
social and economic program in its essentials,
he also favors its farm program. In Des Moines
last August he said, "I will not take away any
of the benefits gained by agriculture during the
last few years. I do not favor changing the
present farm program unless a better one is
gradually evolved."
Willkie likes the New Deal, then, but he
wishes to accomplish its aims "more cheaply."
Yet the government spending which he abhors
is the same spending which makes possible
the farm program, the governmental checks on
large-scale industrial units, the social legisla
tion to which he pays homage.
The Republican candidate, too, says that the
New Deal has ruined industry. Yet the Federal
Reserve Board Index of Production is \3Vi per
cent above the 1929 average. Industry may now
be receiving an artificial stimulus from the de
fense program, but let's contrast the seven com
plete years of the New Deal with the last seven
years of Republicanism. The years 1925 to
1932, which include the Hoover depression and
the Coolidge boom, show a physical volume of
industrial production at 89; the seven Roose
velt years average 92.
No administration which has increased the
national income by 18 billion dollars can be
ruining the country's industry. In fact, statis
tics show that the average of commercial fail
ures has decreased by 742 a month since Roose
velt took office.
{■ resident Roosevelt s foreign policy, center
ing about an able State Department, is one of
his strongest points. Attempts to retain South
America within the United States' instead of
Germany's economic orbit should be, I firmly
believe, continued. And President Roosevelt's
attitude toward totalitarian powers is clear and
definite; it is an established fact that authori
tarian rulers oppose his re-election.
Both candidates have favored the selective
service draft. And yet I cannot support a nom
inee who opposes the equal conscription of
wealth as well as man power in time of peril.
Willkie has done that.
It will not please me today to vote for any
man for a third consecutive term. Yet I believe

that his broad, full experience in foreign af
fairs qualifies the President to lead America
through a tense world situation. Franklin D.
Roosevelt believes in the capitalist economy. If
he has regulated and controlled its activities
he has done so to strengthen it ultimately. He
believes, I am convinced, in worth while re
form, in the furtherance of free enterprise by
fair, democratic means.
And his cohorts, in their stand for universal
brotherhood and equality among people, think
of democracy as an unfinished achievement, a
struggle, and an agency of popular will for a
better way of life.—Dwight Hutchinson

{■ resident Roosevelt s foreign policy, center
ing about an able State Department, is one of
his strongest points. Attempts to retain South
America within the United States' instead of
Germany's economic orbit should be, I firmly
believe, continued. And President Roosevelt's
attitude toward totalitarian powers is clear and
definite; it is an established fact that authori
tarian rulers oppose his re-election.
Both candidates have favored the selective
service draft. And yet I cannot support a nom

Willkie has done that.
It will not please me today to vote for any
man for a third consecutive term. Yet I believe

that his broad, full experience in foreign af
fairs qualifies the President to lead America
through a tense world situation. Franklin D.
Roosevelt believes in the capitalist economy. If
he has regulated and controlled its activities
he has done so to strengthen it ultimately. He
believes, I am convinced, in worth while re
form, in the furtherance of free enterprise by
fair, democratic means.

brotherhood and equality among people, think
of democracy as an unfinished achievement, a
struggle, and an agency of popular will for a

STANFORD has already rather definitely
found its place in the Willkie column.
Whether or not its choice will mirror the na
tional average we'll know tonight. I can say
with all confidence that my words will not
seriously influence one single vote.
They are, at best, a sincere expression, not
flippantly tossed in the faces of the campus'
Republican majority. They constitute the prin
cipal reasons why I shall vote today for Frank
lin D. Roosevelt.
I believe that Wendell Willkie has offered no
constructive program of action. He has failed
during the long months of campaigning to pro
pose any measures which can compare with
the benefits which have accrued to the people
from New Deal legislation.
Wendell Willkie is "all things to all men."
His statements of policy have been conflict
ing and misleading. Either he is hopelessly
confused or deliberately insincere. In New
Haven on Oct. 9 he declared that "the Repub
lican party is the enemy of monopoly." Last
April in Fortune Magazine he said "the Repub
licans started the trend toward concentration
of power."
Speaking at Los Angeles in September, Will
kie stated, "It is my considered opinion that
labor has been the chief sufferer from the poli
cies of the New Deal."
Four days later in Seattle the Republican can
didate declared, "I stand for every one of the
social gains that labor has made. National La
bor Relations Act, free collective bargaining,
minimum wages and maximum hours, social
security benefits, insurance against unemploy
ment, adequate pensions. Now if the New Deal
wants to claim credit for these minimum safe
guards, I say let it have just as much as it
deserves."
If Mr. Willkie actually believes in these and
other measures, all instituted by the Adminis
tration over rather consistent Republican oppo
sition, he stands virtually alone among his party
leaders.
If, too, he sincerely backs most New Deal
legislation he must urge its continuation. His
principal criticism of these enactments lies in
their administration, then, and not their funda
mental construction. It is difficult to see how,
if elected, Willkie might further these laws
when his party stalwarts have sought to kill
them.
Just as Willkie favors the Administration's
social and economic program in its essentials,
he also favors its farm program. In Des Moines
last August he said, "I will not take away any
of the benefits gained by agriculture during the
last few years. I do not favor changing the
present farm program unless a better one is
gradually evolved."
Willkie likes the New Deal, then, but he
wishes to accomplish its aims "more cheaply."
Yet the government spending which he abhors
is the same spending which makes possible
the farm program, the governmental checks on
large-scale industrial units, the social legisla
tion to which he pays homage.
The Republican candidate, too, says that the
New Deal has ruined industry. Yet the Federal
Reserve Board Index of Production is \3Vi per
cent above the 1929 average. Industry may now
be receiving an artificial stimulus from the de
fense program, but let's contrast the seven com
plete years of the New Deal with the last seven
years of Republicanism. The years 1925 to
1932, which include the Hoover depression and

security benefits, insurance against unemploy
ment, adequate pensions. Now if the New Deal
wants to claim credit for these minimum safe
guards, I say let it have just as much as it
deserves."
If Mr. Willkie actually believes in these and
other measures, all instituted by the Adminis
tration over rather consistent Republican oppo
sition, he stands virtually alone among his party
leaders.
If, too, he sincerely backs most New Deal
legislation he must urge its continuation. His
principal criticism of these enactments lies in
their administration, then, and not their funda
mental construction. It is difficult to see how,
if elected, Willkie might further these laws
when his party stalwarts have sought to kill
them.
Just as Willkie favors the Administration's
social and economic program in its essentials,
he also favors its farm program. In Des Moines
last August he said, "I will not take away any
of the benefits gained by agriculture during the
last few years. I do not favor changing the
present farm program unless a better one is
gradually evolved."
Willkie likes the New Deal, then, but he
wishes to accomplish its aims "more cheaply."
Yet the government spending which he abhors
is the same spending which makes possible
the farm program, the governmental checks on
large-scale industrial units, the social legisla
tion to which he pays homage.
The Republican candidate, too, says that the
New Deal has ruined industry. Yet the Federal
Reserve Board Index of Production is \3Vi per
cent above the 1929 average. Industry may now
be receiving an artificial stimulus from the de
fense program, but let's contrast the seven com
plete years of the New Deal with the last seven
years of Republicanism. The years 1925 to
1932, which include the Hoover depression and
the Coolidge boom, show a physical volume of
industrial production at 89; the seven Roose
velt years average 92.
No administration which has increased the
national income by 18 billion dollars can be
ruining the country's industry. In fact, statis
tics show that the average of commercial fail
ures has decreased by 742 a month since Roose
velt took office.
{■ resident Roosevelt s foreign policy, center
ing about an able State Department, is one of
his strongest points. Attempts to retain South
America within the United States' instead of
Germany's economic orbit should be, I firmly
believe, continued. And President Roosevelt's
attitude toward totalitarian powers is clear and
definite; it is an established fact that authori
tarian rulers oppose his re-election.
Both candidates have favored the selective
service draft. And yet I cannot support a nom
inee who opposes the equal conscription of
wealth as well as man power in time of peril.
Willkie has done that.
It will not please me today to vote for any
man for a third consecutive term. Yet I believe

that his broad, full experience in foreign af
fairs qualifies the President to lead America
through a tense world situation. Franklin D.
Roosevelt believes in the capitalist economy. If
he has regulated and controlled its activities
he has done so to strengthen it ultimately. He
believes, I am convinced, in worth while re
form, in the furtherance of free enterprise by
fair, democratic means.
And his cohorts, in their stand for universal
brotherhood and equality among people, think
of democracy as an unfinished achievement, a
struggle, and an agency of popular will for a
better way of life.—Dwight Hutchinson
STANFORD has already rather definitely
found its place in the Willkie column.
Whether or not its choice will mirror the na
tional average we'll know tonight. I can say
with all confidence that my words will not
seriously influence one single vote.
They are, at best, a sincere expression, not
flippantly tossed in the faces of the campus'
Republican majority. They constitute the prin
cipal reasons why I shall vote today for Frank
lin D. Roosevelt.
I believe that Wendell Willkie has offered no
constructive program of action. He has failed
during the long months of campaigning to pro
pose any measures which can compare with
the benefits which have accrued to the people
from New Deal legislation.
Wendell Willkie is "all things to all men."
His statements of policy have been conflict
ing and misleading. Either he is hopelessly
confused or deliberately insincere. In New
Haven on Oct. 9 he declared that "the Repub
lican party is the enemy of monopoly." Last
April in Fortune Magazine he said "the Repub
licans started the trend toward concentration
of power."
Speaking at Los Angeles in September, Will
kie stated, "It is my considered opinion that
labor has been the chief sufferer from the poli
cies of the New Deal."
Four days later in Seattle the Republican can
didate declared, "I stand for every one of the
social gains that labor has made. National La
bor Relations Act, free collective bargaining,
minimum wages and maximum hours, social
security benefits, insurance against unemploy
ment, adequate pensions. Now if the New Deal
wants to claim credit for these minimum safe
guards, I say let it have just as much as it
