# We Want Willkie
## 
### 
Dear boss;
Years ago there was an old saying about
the Daily shack that "you may be right, but
I'm the Editor." You're the Editor, boss, but
tonight I think I'M right.
I want Wendell Willkie for President.
For eight years I've been eyeing New Deal
policies, watching New Deal construction, and
listening to Roosevelt's supporters call him
God. And much but the last I've found good.
During the same eight years, however, there
have been many things which I have not found
agreeable in the policies and attitudes of the
New Deal and its President. There have been
many things which rubbed against the grain of
my concept of government and democracy.
Wendell Willkie has given voice to those ob
jections. Objections against New Deal action
which I have felt but have seldom heard
spoken during those eight years. And, at the
same time, he has accepted the basic strength
and purpose of such New Deal action which I
have found to be good.
This may serve to illustrate what I mean.
I do not like the spirit of the Administration's
business policy. Much-needed control was ap
plied in 1932, but this control at the same time
brushed off business' attempts at co-operation.
The New Deal plumped down too many "thou
shalt nots" upon the shoulders of the nation's
businesses . . . with not enough concrete ex
planation.
This is a capitalistic country. There must be
co-operation, not antagonism, between big
business and government.
Plant expansion and employment openings
did not appear with government reforms. Busi
ness incentive did not result from New Deal
business legislation. Relief upon a gigantic
scale was the inevitable result.
Some relief will always be necessary. But
not relief under a government headed by a
President with an attitude toward reforms ap
proaching that of a "Junior league social
worker." Today there are over 9,000,000 unem
ployed workers in America.
I want a job when I graduate, not relief.
I do not like President Roosevelt's intoler
ance to opposition. When he attempted to
stack the Supreme Court he was attempting to
remove the last vestige of control exerted over
himself by this system of government in which
we believe. With a rubber-stamping Congress,
success in the Supreme Court attempt would
have dealt a severe blow to American democ
racy.
A contrast to the New Deal view of govern
mental domination with control in the hands of
President Roosevelt, is Mr. Willkie's sworn be
lief in the American system of private owner
ship and free enterprise. Mr. Willkie enjoys
the trust of even those who oppose him.
Mr. Roosevelt combined insincerity with
hatred of opposition when he dictated the action
of the Democratic National Convention. "I
must be drafted to serve," was his statement.
I must be your candidate," were his orders
to the convention. He proved mastery over his
party, while discarding his party's confidence,
when he demanded the nomination of Henry
Wallace.
"I will only run if drafted," said Mr. Roose
velt. In 1938 members of his cabinet family
sounded the country for feeling on the tjiird
term issue.
I do not like insincerity in government.
Master of the "grand gesture," Roosevelt has
used the big stick too often in his dealings with
foreign governments. He has already been ex
tremely provocative to the dictators. The Roose
velt temperament leads toward impetuosity in
diplomatic action. He thumbed the American
nose to the Axis with his unprecedented action
in trading the 50 destroyers to Britain without
consent of Congress.
He may "gesture" us into war.
I think that the government of the next four
years must of necessity be a compromise gov
ernment, with representatives of both parties
representing the viewpoint of a united country.
Roosevelt bluffed such a compromise but his
Republican members in the cabinet are hardly
true representatives of the G.O.P.
The personality of a new leader would be a
vital tonic to the country. Today, Roosevelt
cannot inspire the confidence he could in 1932.
The past eight years have made confidence in
Roosevelt a difficult matter. Willkie would have
the confidence of the electorate ... he would
not face the outraged sentiments of the people
and even a vast section of his own party as
would Mr. Roosevelt.
I want to return to the true spirit of democ
racy in which Mr. Willkie believes. I believe
we can continue in the American way.â€” Wil
