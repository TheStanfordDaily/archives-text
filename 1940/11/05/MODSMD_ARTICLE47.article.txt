# Russell Pursues Aherne Through Madcap Comedy
## 
### 
"HIRED WIFE." with Rosalind Russell, Brian Aherne, Virginia Bruce,
and Robert Bench ley, now placing at the Stanford Theater.
As well as being amusing, entertaining, witty, and other applicable ad
jectives. this comedy provides an excellent camera's-eye view of the
gentle feminine art of catching a man.

In this particular case Brian
Aherne is a cement magnate suscep
tible to blondes in spring (like hay
fever), Rosalind Russell his indis
pensable secretary. In her super
efficient way she loves him, and pro
tects him from his seasonal amor
ous attacks.
STRICTLY PLATONIC
They are married for business
reasons so that he can put his as
sets in her name, and forestall an
impending bankruptcy suit. Purely
a marriage of convenience—so he
thinks until she gets down to work.
But with Mama holding the purse
strings Poppa is not in an advan
tageous position.
However, Aherne thinking he is
in love with Virginia Bruce, puts
up a manly struggle. Whereupon
Miss Russell calls up her reserves in
the form of a South American gig
olo, whom she turns loose on the
Other Woman.
AND BENCHLEY TOO
After this the plot goes through a
series of convolutions as complicated
as anything that's come out of Hol
lywood lately but succeeds in reach
ing a finale happy for all con
cerned.
The whole thing is as shiny and
attractive as cellophane, the tempo
and feeling are sensitively adapted
to each scene. The acting is fault
less—even to Benchley's sleep-talk
ing bits.
The other half of the bill is de
voted to a gloomy news commentary
—''London Can Take It" and "Sky
Murder" in which Nick Carter
looked as if he needed a little liver
pill.—Douglass
