SCENES AUTHENTIC
The picture is supposed to take

international rivalry for the honor of

tude. The English cinema company
which climbed the Alps for the
breath-taking and realistic scenes is
the first to record a picture in such
a natural setting. No English corn
flakes were used for effect, for scenes
were actually photographed on the
Matterhorn.
BRITISH ACTORS STAR
Robert Douglas, Joan Gardner,
Luis Trenker, and Mary Clare head
the all-star English cast. Contrary
to belief, this is not a war picture.

the first to reach the mountain's
summit, for in so doing he knows he
will bring glory and tourist trade
for his native town of Breuil.
The picture was shown during the
summer session, and is being re
peated tonight because of popular
demand, according to the Commit
tee on Public Exercises.
