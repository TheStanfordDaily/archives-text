# Students Break Encina Phones
## 
### 
Reports notwithstanding to the
effect that Stanford "was dead on its
feet" last week-end while the ma
jority of the campus was reveling
in Los Angeles, there was enough
life left on the Farm that Encina
residents will be faced with a se
verely crippled telephone service
for an indefinite period.
Sometime between the Encina ex
change's closing time Friday night
and its opening Saturday morning,
some marauder or marauders broke
off the hooks on 12 of Encina's 13
corridor phones.
"The phones will not be repaired
until the students have convinced
me that they really want them,"
said Dean John Bunn yesterday.
"Encina is a community proposi
tion, and responsibility must be
shared by the group as a whole. The
innocent must suffer the conse
quences with the guilty," added
Dean Bunn.
The destruction was discovered
Saturday morning. When the ex
change operator plugged in at 7
o'clock, practically every phone in
Encina was in use. When no one
answered his requests for num
bers, he called for an investigation.
The only corridor phone missed
; was in the Bull-pen. It will con
tinue in service, as will the two pay
| phones in the main lobby.
