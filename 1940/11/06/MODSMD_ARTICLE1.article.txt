### BOB LOW 
capital in the world last
J night was watching the election
returns in the United States.
For some time reports from abroad
have indicated that the Axis dic
tators were interested in the elec
tion to more than a slight extent.
These reports probably will never
l>e verified.
President Roosevelt several days
ago stated his reason for accepting
an unprecedented third term nom
ination. He said that the critical
foreign situation required the pres
ence of an experienced hand in the
White House. It was, he said, his
duty to offer his services to his
country at this time.
This morning the election results
stole the headlines and most of the
space in American newspapers, but
this did not mean that the foreign
situation has lost significance—only
that for the moment the election
warranted premier attention in this
country.
Tomorrow foreign dispatches
will he hack on the front pages
and Americans will Ik* made
aware that the position of Cireat
Britain has become more critical
while they were preoccupied with
the election.

£T IS true that the Italians are ap
parently stopped, at least for a
time, by the Albanians, but even the
most, optimistic observers place little
significance in this show of resist
ance.
What is regarded with apprehen
sion is the news that German troops
are concentrating by the thousands
in Rumania. The presence of forces
of this strength is not a precau
tionary measure; the Yugoslavs and
Bulgars are not likely to pounce on
Nazi-dominated Rumania.
Although the British have prom
ised aid to Greece, it appears that
the country will not hold out for
long with added pressure from the
north. Russia evidently has at
least partially agreed to the Axis
push into the Balkans.
The fall of Greece will be detri
mental to the British for several
reasons:
First, the Axis will have a new
strategically located base in the
eastern Mediterranean from which
to launch further attacks on the
Suez and on Egypt.
Second, Turkey will be all but
surrounded and she will have to
submit to Axis demands.
Third, Axis control of Turkey and
the Dardanelles will give Italy and
Germany an opportunity to crash on
to the rich Near Eastern oil fields.
Fourth, Britain's continental
blockade in such an eventuality will
be all but futile, for the Axis will
have access to the one commodity
.she must have to continue the war.

| N SPITE of the "encouraging" re
ports of Greek resistance, then
the situation for Britain becomes
more critical day by day. Not only
is there the possibility of military
defeat in the event an expeditionary
force is sent to Greece; there are
even more ominous possibilities.
In the past, speculation on Brit
ain's losses at sea have been mini
mized in London and officials have
claimed that, the losses have been
made up for by confiscation of ships
of other nations and by the building
of new ones.
6ut the tonnage of Norway, Bel
gium, the Netherlands, and of Den
mark is already in the hands of the
British. Undoubtedly the British
are more hard-pressed to maintain
their vital supply routes than ever
before.
So the capitals of the world watch
ed the American Presidential elec
tion. The British know that they
will continue to receive aid from
the United States in ever-increasing
quantities; the Axis knows it will
find no syippathy in America.
