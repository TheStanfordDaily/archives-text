# Roosevelt Tide Sweeps Country as Third Term Precedent Is Smashed
## Most Fiercely Contested Election Since '16 Gives Willkie 12,251,393, Roosevelt 15,083,262 at Midnight 
### 
Franklin Delano Roosevelt swept into the office of Presi
dent of the United States for the third time yesterday, roll
ing up a total of 447 electoral votes to his Republican oppo
nent, Wendell Willkie's 84.
These figures are based on United Press figures releaser!
at midnight last night.
The election was termed the most fiercely contested since
the Wilson-Hughes election of 1916, and resulted in an un-

precedented turnout at the
polls.
According to the incomplete re
turns Willkie totalled a popular
vote of 12,000,000 approximately
3,000,000 under that of President
Roosevelt.
WIIJLKIE STATES
Willkie carried seven states defi
nitely—Maine, North Dakota, Ver
mont, Kansas, Colorado, Nebraska,
South Dakota, and possibly New
Jersey, Michigan, Indiana, and
lowa.
A little after midnight (E.S.T.)
President Roosevelt appeared before
a cheering crowd of his neighbors in
Duchess County, N.Y., declaring
that he will l-emain just about tho
same man he has been in the past.
"We, of course, face difficult time.t
in this country," Mr. Roosevelt, said,
"but I think you will find me the
same Franklin Roosevelt that you
have known for a great many years."
F.R. AWAITED RETURNS
The President said that, his elec
tion was not yet confirmed—that the
returns from California and Oregon
and other states of the Far West a«
yet wcye only scattered.
"But," he said, "it. looks all right "
Wendell Willkie appeared before
a wildly enthusiastic crowd of his
supporters in the lobby of the Con
gress Hotel in New York City, his
headquarters, at approximately
12:30 o'clock (E.S.T.).
"I hope that none of you ate
either afraid or disheartened, be
cause I am not in the slightest," he
said. "I just wanted to come down
and thank you so much for being
my fellow supporters in this strug
gle, to say 'hello' to you before going
back to my room upstairs."
NO STATEMENT
In answer to frantic shouts of
j "Don't give up!" from the assem *
blage, he answered:
"Those of you who are saying that
don't know me."
The defeated candidate retired
11:30 a.m. (EST.) without making
any formal statement regarding the
outcome of the election. His only
| remark was:
"I am not giving up."
The Republican candidate for the
Vice-Presidency, Senator Charles L.
McNary, conceded the election at
around 9:30 o'clock (P.S.T.). Several
notable pro-Willkie papers, among
them the influential New York
Times, had conceded prior to that
time.
From London, reports poured over
the wires that Great Britain was
"jubilant" over the re-election of
President Roosevelt, foreseeing in
the event an increase of the United
States' "all aid, short of war" to the
warring democracy. The London ra- J
ciios and newspapers had given [
running reports on the election all
through the night.
iiRITONS FAVOR F.R.
Although it has been emphasized ;
there that both President Roosevelt
and his opponent were pledged to |
.-insist the British war effort, Britons
generally strongly favored "our old
trusted friend, Roosevelt, because
of his vigorous condemnations of
aggressors and his proven readiness
to transform words into action."
Found "significant" by most ob- j
servers was the fact that Willkie ;
carried New Jersey handily, thereby I
defeating Boss Frank Hague's j
fumed Democratic Jersey City ma- :
chine.
