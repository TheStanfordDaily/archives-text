# Cotillion Bid Lost in Midst Of Quad Crowd
## Gruesome Theme Promised Dancers For Friday Night 
### 
Standing atop the steps of English
Corner yesterday morning, Shorty
Grannis flung an armful of candy to
the students massed beneath him. In
| the wrappers of two of the candies
were Sophomore Cotillion bids for a
I pair of lucky scramblers.
When the pile of bodies was un
i tangled only one holder of a' lucky
candy could be unearthed. He is
Maurice Barusch. What happened to
the holder of the other candy is de
batable or, at any rate, unknown.
Members of the decoration com
mittee for the Cotillion have been
working over at the Pavilion for the
past few days, and are busy prepar
ing the most gruesome possible set
ting for the dance in keeping with
the catacombs theme. The recon
structed underground ruins will be
realistic in a chilly, dank atmos
phere.
Skinnay Ennis and his danceable
orchestra will handle the musical
end of the affair with Carmine and
Sonny Dawson heading the vocal
department. Hot trombonist Pete
| Carpenter will punctuate the smooth
i melodies with torrid solos for those
who appreciate an occasional bit of
J swing. Refreshments will be served
i by appropriately costumed attend
ants.
