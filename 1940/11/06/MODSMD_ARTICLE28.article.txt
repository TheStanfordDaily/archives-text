A presidential poll conducted on
universities throughout the coun-
I try by Irving Glasband, Southern
California student, showed a Willkie
preference. The poll was divided
geographically by the Mississippi
River, Willkie getting better odds
in the eastern half of the country.
The total vote gave Willkie 50
per cent, Roosevelt 46.4 per cent and
also-rans 3.6 per cent. The West
! tallied Willkie 50.8 per cent. Roose-
I velt 48.2 per cent, and the others
' 1 per cent. East of the Mississippi
| the vote went 49.6 per cent for
Willkie, 45.2 per cent for Roose
velt, and 4.9 per cent for the strag
glers. The recent Stanford straw
vote contributed to Glasband's poll.
