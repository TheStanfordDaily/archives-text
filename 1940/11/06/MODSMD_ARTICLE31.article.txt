## JERRY BRUCKER, Sports Editor Indians to 'Shoot Works' Against Huskies; Hope To Hit Rose Bowl Trail 
### 
Coach Clark Shaughnessy drove his Indians hard .yesterday, and the
arc lights burned over the practice held until after 7 o'clock. Already
a week behind his rival, Coach Jimmy Plielan, in preparing for this
week's deciding conference game with Washington's Huskies, Shaugh
nessy is pressing hard to catch up with the men from the north.

It seems that now there is a good<
chance that Vic Lindskog, the Cards' !
rugged candidate for all-Coast hon- j
ors at center, will be able to start
Saturday's game despite his injured
hand. However, he was not in a suit
yesterday; and his capable substi
tutes, Doug Stahle and hefty Colin
McClintock, were runing at the first
and second pivot spots, respectively. I
LINEMEN RETURN
Though Shaughnessy will have
again at his call this Saturday two
linemen who started the first four
games of the season, Jack Warnecke
and Chuck Taylor, the Indian head
coach might choose to start in their
place those two vastly improved
linemen who filled in for these first
stringers in the U.S.C. and U.C.L.A.
games, Ed Stamm and Ken Robesky.
Stamm, the giant sophomore
tackle, started both the Trojan and
Bruin games and was largely re- !
sponsible for stopping U.S.C.'s Peo
ples and Bant a on their powerful
off-tackle thrusts in the last half of ]
this game.
ROBESKY SHINES
Robesky is a senior who has work
ed his way to the top the hard way.
When first-stringer Taylor turned
an ankle in the Trojan game, Ken
popped ofT the bench and into the '
lray to spill Peoples for a four-yard
loss on the first running play. He
continued to shine in this game and
last Saturday in Los Angeles against
the Bruins.
Washington as well as Stanford
has its injury problems. Ernie
Steele, Husky halfback, has a frac
tured finger and will have to wear a
splint on this, his passing hand, next
Saturday. Rudy Mucha, Phelan's
hot and cold All-Coast center pros- j
pect, is bothered by a sore shoulder I
and may not be at full strength for j
the Stanford tilt.
RAZZLE-DAZZLE
Yesterday, Shaughnessy and his |
coaching staff dug deep into their I
bag of tricks for some new plays and
formations for this approaching,
most important game of the season.
In their effort to blast the Huskies
from the trail to the Rose Bowl, the
Cardinals will shoot the works.
Both the first and second stringers
rolled through almost two hours of !
signal practice on the offensive I
against dummies. Tomorrow or the
next day they will, as they usually
do late in the week, shift their at
tention to stopping what the north
erners have to throw at them.
