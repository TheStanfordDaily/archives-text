# Water Poloists To Invade S.J. Pools Tonight
## 
### 
Handicapped by the probable loss
through injury of forward Dave
Nottage, the Stanford varsity water
polo squad will tangle with the San
Jose State varsity following the pre
liminary fracas between the i'rosh
paddlers of the two schools.
Playing the game in the San Jose
pool is expected to make things
tough for the varsity as well as for
the freshmen because of the extreme
shallowness of the pool. Players ax - e
not allowed to touch the bottom
without having a foul called on
them, usually resulting in six or
seven penalties on the visiting team,
enough to turn the tide of victory
in a hard-fought game.
NOTTAGE INJURED
Nottage suffered a hard blow on
the nose in the U.S.C. game last Sat
urday morning, resulting in smashed
cartilages, and the doctor may not
allow him to play because of the
danger of infection. As he tied for
the high-scoring honors in the
southern tilt, his loss may well mean
the margin between victory and de
feat.
Tradition is in favor of the In
dians, for San Jose has only been
victorious once in the history of the
two-game yearly series between the
teams, a series which started in 1934.
CARDS FAVORED
The Cards are the current favo
rites, but the Spartans are reported
to have improved very fast since the
two defeats that they suffered at the
hands of the Stanford splashers
earlier in the season, and it is en
tirely possible that they may pull a
surprise upset and wallop the Red
skins.
The Stanford line-up: sprint,
Weeden; forwards, Tietjen and Man
waring, Jamieson or Hauerwass;
centerback. Jessup; left guard, Ma
rino (captain): goalie, Bleckener or
Smith.
