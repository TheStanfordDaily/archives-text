# Tough Frosh Grid Team To Face Cal
## 
### 
Ambling along on the momentum
j they gained with their victory over
Pomona J. C. last week-end, Cali
! fornia's freshman eleven will prob
ably be a tough club for the Stan
| lord frosh to handle when the two
teams meet in Memorial Stadium
this Saturday.
Although the Cubs did not look
too potent in their 7-0 win over
Pomona, Assistant Frosh Coach Bob
Dakan. who scouted the game, re
ports that it was evident that they
were playing under wraps, probably
preferring to withhold the greater
part of their bag of tricks for the
Little Big Game.
If past performances are uny cri
teria, there is one boy who bids fair
to give the Papooses a rough time
Saturday. He is Billy Reinhard,
165-pound brother of the Cal var
sity tackle; and according to all re
ports of the Cal frosh's previous
games he is quite a runner. Another
Cub back who showed well last
week-end was tiny Tony Messina,
1 150-pound reserve halfback from
; Crockett, who was responsible for
| the lone Cal touchdown.
Although comparative season rec
ords against common opponents puts
Stanford firmly in the favorite's seat
for this game, this is still the Little
Big Game; and whenever Stanford
! and California athletic teams meet,
sure-fire predictions are just as
liable to be all wet as not.
According to statistics, the rail
roads of the United States now own
or operate more automobile trucks
than locomotives.
