# Hawaii Swimming Team Works Hard
## 
### 
WAILUKU, MAUI, Hawaii (UP).
â€”To make swimming champions,
swim them eight hours a day.
This formula, too tough for most
coaches, brings home the bacon for
smiling Soichi Sakamoto, who illus
trates the pronunciation of his first
name by scratching his arm vigor
ously ("So-itchy").
Methodical and endlessly pains
taking. Sakamoto uses daily work
sheets for his Alexander House
Community Association swimmers,
several of whom are national cham
pions.
