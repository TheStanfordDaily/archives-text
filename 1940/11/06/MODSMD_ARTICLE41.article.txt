# Alpha Delts Top Phi Delts 1-0; El Tigre Forfeits to Phi Psi
## 
### 
The hitherto undefeated Phi Delt ball handlers slugged it out on even
terms with the strong Alpha Dells \csterriay only In lose the game in an
overtime period. The s'lii Dolts displayed power on the ground, while the
Alpha Delts were the largest yardage gainers. A controversial pass inter
ception by Frank Mitchell of the Alpha Delts complicated matters some-

what. but the yardage superiority of
the Alpha Delts in the five overtime
plays earned them the nod.
The Phi Psis won the only re
maining game over the El Tigres by
the forfeit route.
Only one volleyball team, the El
Campos, showed up to gain a forfeit
decision over the Betas as the elec
tion proved too strong an attraction
for other competitors.
