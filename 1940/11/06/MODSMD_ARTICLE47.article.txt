TT'S all over.
1 The last canvass-shrouded voting booth has
been piled in the corner. Tired, grave election
boards are tabulating the final results. The
United Press' chattering teletype is unwinding
the story of political victory. A stubborn, un
yielding Wendell Willkie, in conference with
party chieftains in a smoke-filled Hotel Com
modore room, refuses to concede defeat.
But America, having cast its ballot, knows
that its chief executive for the next four years
will be Franklin D. Roosevelt.
The United States, with sure confidence and
considered judgment, has named a man to the
presidency for the third term. Post-campaign
celebrations are in progress across the country.
The Democrats are, tonight, exultant with
triumph, just as the Republicans once more are
depressed with defeat.
But the real winner of the 1940 campaign, one
of the most bitter, hard-fought presidential
races, is American democracy. Across the
ocean—both to the east and the west—totalitar
ian commanders may sneer at the prospect of
a free people choosing, actually choosing, the
men who will carry forth the issues and ideas
which they approve.
Though they may shudder at the re-election
of President Roosevelt, an avowed enemy of
authoritarianism, they must feel that the United
States is shaken by party divisions. The close
ness of the vote in some sections might make
them believe that America is disunified, divided
by political cleavage.
If, indeed, they think this is true they are
mistaken. For today, this morning, America's
partisan play is finished.
America has, today, scored the greatest tri
umph of all. For freely, without coercion or dic
tation, the United States has elected its leaders.
And democracy, a product of hard work and
unswerving conviction, has proved itself an
active force in a world where it has had little
repute these days.
