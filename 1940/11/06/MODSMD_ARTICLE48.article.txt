# A 						Democratic Press

### 
IF ANY one group in the United States (be
sides the Republican National Committee)
missed calling the election correctly, it was the
nation's press.
It is a little saddening tonight to look back
over the campaign and evaluate the place of
the Fourth Estate. Almost without exception
papers backed the candidacy of Willkie. On
election eve, if one were to believe what they
printed, Wendell had packed his toothbrush and
was ready to move into the White House.
And yet by 9:30 Tuesday night no one in the
world doubted that Roosevelt had been selected
by Mr. and Mrs. Citizen, completely and with
out reservation.
This strange feat of the press, its ability to
side 100 per cent with the unpopular candidate,
duplicates its 1936 performance when it
trumped up the Landon cause to the point that
it actually had people believing that Alf had
a chance.
It would not be so regrettable if this attitude
were reflected only in editorial comment. Ev
ery newspaper in the nation is entitled to ex
press its opinion. But when almost every major
paper champions the losing candidate, it must
indicate that the American press is sadly out of
step with the people it serves.
Furthermore, the nation's press has not been
content to express its opinions alone but has,
in addition, stooped to coloring news content
and shifting news-play so that its favored can
didate received every conceivable "break" in
the campaign race.
Mr. Roosevelt had a doubly difficult fight to
makeâ€”he had to defeat not only an able op
ponent, Mr. Willkie, but a thoroughly hostile
press. That is why his vindication at the hands
of the American electorate constitutes a serious
indictment of present-day journalism.
A newspaper is, in a sense, a single person
ality. It presents the judgment of its publisher
(one man) and its advertisers (unified by virtue
of economic class). What these powerful men
order, a paper must print.

But a paper is, too, a public utility. When,
forsaking all attempts to present unbiased news
coverage and to confine editorialization to the
correct columns, a paper prostitutes itself be
fore the public it cannot fail to suffer in the
final analysis.
The American press has suffered by its
wholesale sell-out to a cause which popular
vote has failed to support. Its voice has been
emotional and unsound.
And today the vaunted "power of the press"
is seriously crippled, perhaps lost.
