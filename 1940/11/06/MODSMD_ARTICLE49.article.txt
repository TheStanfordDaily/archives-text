. . . AND GIVE A CHEER FOR STANFORD SNOBS
is enough. And you've probably had
enough of this election business from the front
page of this paper to last you from now until Mother's
Day. So let's jump back to a discussion of the last
liquid week-end in Los Angeles.
Probably nowhere, at no other school in the coun
try will you find as large a mass migration between
two campuses as took place between Stanford and
U.C.L.A. last week. The student special train was
as full as a Cecil B. DeMille production. The root
ing section looked like scenes from "Cimarron"—with
out Richard Dix. And Highway 101 had more Stanford
cars on it than Henry Ford's assembly line on
double pay.
Plenty of people went south. The rooting section
was crammed with people (students), some with their
hair slightly gray at the temples.
And all these cars on the highway meant just
one thing, the usual thing—trouble with the cops.
❖ * a|( He
hate Stanford students. It's the truth. And
A it's been going on for quite some time now. And
when a cop comes right out and says it, then you
know he must have it bad.
Last summer, a Stanford sophomore was stopped
by a California cop. To smooth things over, this stu
dent started up a conversation which finally worked
around to Stanford. Stanford conversations have a
way of doing that thing. After a few minutes the
cop spoke.
"You know," he siad, "you're the nicest Stanford
kid I've met up with yet. When I was back on the
101 route, we boys sure used to lay for you Stanford
kids. We used to <»heck the days on the calendar
when you would be going and coming from school.
And then we'd have a field day."
"All you Stanford guys are a bunch of snobs. Ev
erytime you get stopped you wise-acre around and
get off a lot of unnecessary cracks."

r pHAT'S exaggerating it a little. In reality Stanford
drivers are extremely courteous on the road.
They have a lot of territory to cover in a very little
time. And they do it in very gentlemanly style.
It sort of looks like the cops think that Stanford
ites are a gold mine. Last week-end they dove into
this gold mine with a sickening abandon. We didn't
get a ticket, but ask the person next to you, and he
probably did . It was a red-letter day which the cops
had circled on their calendars.

Stanford students are gentlemen and gentlewomen
on the road. They like to signal with trucks to see
if it is safe to pass. They stop frequently, several cars
at a time, for coffee and a chat.
Last Sunday night, just outside of Salinas, a
couple of young Salinas high school boys fell asleep
and crashed their car into a telephone pole. Hun
dreds of cars roared on up the highway past the
wreck.
But it was finally Stanford students, three sepa
rate, unattached cars full of them, who finally came to
the aid of these kids, who stopped to clear the wreck
age, to walk into the bloody glass in order to wrap
the injured kid in blankets to keep him warm until
the ambulance came, to cheer the badly cut kid
driver who stood shaking on the verge of tears, just
staring at his dazed friend.
Those must have been the snobs that the cop was
talking about.
