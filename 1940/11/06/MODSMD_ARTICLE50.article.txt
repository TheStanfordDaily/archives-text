# CAMPUS OPINION
## BATHTUB BALLAD 
### 
r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
A bunch of the boys and gals were whooping it
up last Saturday night in one of the better known Los
Angeles roadhouses, the Cocoanut Grove to be exact.
During one of the intervals when the orchestra went
out to powder its collective noses, these same boys
and gals broke into the melodious strains of a new
patriotic song, "God Bless Clark Shaughnessy." At
the conclusion of this rendition, the assembled multi
tudes applauded vociferously and energetically for
quite some time.
This was indeed encouraging to the originators of
the song, and it was tried later on in the evening in
one of the lesser known taverns with equal success.
This second outburst of approval was enough to con
vince these overoptimistic, maniacal song improvisers
that they had a hit.
So here is what they are going to do. They are
going to present the lyrics of this new ditty along
with its old dilapidated melody to you loyal Indians
for your approval. If you as Indian supporters like it
you can clamor for it through one Gordon Nicoll or
you can demand it in a rally, or you can bellow it in
the bathtub.
The writers really don't care when or where you
sing it, they just hope you want to sing it. So, after
all this palaver, here it is. The tune is "God Bless
America" and Kate Smith has not been asked to
sing it.
GOD BLESS CLARK SHAUGHNESSY
God bless Clark Shaughnessy
Frankie Albert, too.
Stand beside them and guide them
And they will bring victories dear to you.
We won at Kezar
We trimmed old Oregon
Then the Bronco and U.S.C.
God bless Clark Shaughnessy .
And Norm Standlee
God bless Clark Shaughnessy
And Norm Standlee.
There are other verses ready to go into effect after
Saturday, so please don't worry about the words be
coming too monotonous to repeat.
The writers believe that the song is particularly
appropriate at this time bocause the famous Stanford
spirit had been fast reaching its lowest ebb when
this man came from out of nowhere and showed us
the light. The writers mention two other men and
for good reason they believe. One is the best field
general in western football, and the other is the best
fullback in the United States. So there is your song,
students; do with it what you like. If you like it let
it be known; if you burn it, the writers will hang
their heads momentarily and then carry on with
"thumbs up" just as though nothing had happened.
Sincerely yours,
Ming Whang

The writers believe that the song is particularly
appropriate at this time bocause the famous Stanford
spirit had been fast reaching its lowest ebb when
this man came from out of nowhere and showed us
the light. The writers mention two other men and
for good reason they believe. One is the best field
general in western football, and the other is the best
fullback in the United States. So there is your song,
students; do with it what you like. If you like it let
it be known; if you burn it, the writers will hang
their heads momentarily and then carry on with
"thumbs up" just as though nothing had happened.
Sincerely yours,

r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
A bunch of the boys and gals were whooping it
up last Saturday night in one of the better known Los
Angeles roadhouses, the Cocoanut Grove to be exact.
During one of the intervals when the orchestra went
out to powder its collective noses, these same boys
and gals broke into the melodious strains of a new
patriotic song, "God Bless Clark Shaughnessy." At
the conclusion of this rendition, the assembled multi
tudes applauded vociferously and energetically for
quite some time.
This was indeed encouraging to the originators of
the song, and it was tried later on in the evening in
one of the lesser known taverns with equal success.
This second outburst of approval was enough to con
vince these overoptimistic, maniacal song improvisers
that they had a hit.
So here is what they are going to do. They are
going to present the lyrics of this new ditty along
with its old dilapidated melody to you loyal Indians
for your approval. If you as Indian supporters like it
you can clamor for it through one Gordon Nicoll or
you can demand it in a rally, or you can bellow it in
the bathtub.
The writers really don't care when or where you
sing it, they just hope you want to sing it. So, after
all this palaver, here it is. The tune is "God Bless
America" and Kate Smith has not been asked to
sing it.
GOD BLESS CLARK SHAUGHNESSY
God bless Clark Shaughnessy
Frankie Albert, too.
Stand beside them and guide them
And they will bring victories dear to you.
We won at Kezar
We trimmed old Oregon
Then the Bronco and U.S.C.
God bless Clark Shaughnessy .
And Norm Standlee
God bless Clark Shaughnessy
And Norm Standlee.
There are other verses ready to go into effect after
Saturday, so please don't worry about the words be
coming too monotonous to repeat.
