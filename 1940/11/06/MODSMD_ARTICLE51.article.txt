"THE BELOVED RETURNS: LOTTE IN WEIMAR,'' by Thomas Mann,
translated by 11. T. Lowe-Porter, Alfred Knopf, Inc., New York. On sale
at the Stanford Bookstore.
In the summer of 1772 Hans Kestner, his betrothed Charlotte Bull, and
Joiiann Wolfgang von Goethe spent a beautiful, if sad, companionship in

the little town of Wetzlar, where,
Goethe and Kestner were fellow law
students. Goethe, in the course of
the friendship, also fell in love with
Lotte, discreetly made love to her,
expressed touching sentiments, but
resigned himself to her approaching
marriage with Hans .
Goethe departed from Wetzlar be
fore the wedding, giving up his law
studies. The following year the
Kestners were somewhat outraged
when Goethe published "The Sor
rows of Young Werther," the ro
mantic novel based on their triangle
courtship which started the romantic
revolution in Germany.
RETURNS FOR VISIT
Forty-four years later Lotte, 63
years old, a widow and the mother
of 11 children, satisfied her curiosity
to meet again the greatest man of
his age by visiting Weimar, osten
sibly to see her sister and brother
in-law who lived there, accompa
nied by her daughter, Lottchen. It
is this visit that Thomas Mann has
made into a novel.
"The Beloved Returns" has per
haps more properly been called a
study of genius than merely a novel.
It is more a novel of dialogue than
even Mann's previous works; of re
flective dialogue. It is not the best
thing Mann has written, but he is so
superior to his contemporaries that
we need not worry whether or
not it is of lasting value.
A succession of callers on Lotte
upon her arrival at her hotel reveal
Goethe as a genius, not a god.
Fraulein Schopenhauer relates the
near break between Goethe and his
son, the ultimate subjection of the
boy to the will of the father who
had in his youth been a violent revo
lutionary, and the admiration Goethe
still held for Napoleon (after Water
loo) as an internationalist.
POWERS REVEALED
Through his own meditations
Goethe reveals his powers and his
pettiness. He knows there is some
thing in man and in a poem that is

always out of the reach of man. But
he protests when scientists refuse to
accept his scientific theories.
Lotte and the great one meet only
once, except for a farewell meeting,
during her stay in Weimar. He
gives a small, very formal dinner in
honor of her and her daughter, small
enough not to cause too much stir
in the town and formal enough to
avoid unnecessary and absurd remi
niscence. When they later meet
privately for a farewell, Goethe
says he gave Lotte "eternal youth."
She replies, perHaps ironically,
"Peace be to your old age."â€”Adams
