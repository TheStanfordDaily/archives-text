### BOB LOW 
J>RESIDENT ROOSEVELT had
only a few things to say yester
day following his victory in the
election but they were of the ut
most importance.
"After the ballots are counted,'' he
said, "the United States of America
will still be united. Discussion
among us should and will continue,
for we are free citizens of a free
nation. But there can be no argu
ments about the essential fact that
in our desire to remain at peace by
defending our democracy, we are one
nation and one people."
These words were not uttered in
the course of a political campaign
speech. They were the words of
the man who knows that America
faces a most trying future and that
the responsibility for America's
safe passage through these times
remains to a very great extent
upon his own shoulders.
The President docs not seek to
curb discussion, as he clearly points
out, but he feels that we need a
certain unity at this time.
* * *
A s , IF to demonstrate the type of
differences he wishes to eliminate
from the American picture, the
President immediately intimated yes
terday that he desires foremost to
settle the conflict between the CIO
and the AFL.
The President found the opportu
nity to suggest this as he spoke to
reporters yesterday following a cere
mony at which he laid the corner
stone of a post office in his home
town of Hyde Park.
Workmen, watching the ceremo
nies, bore placards reflecting the bit
terness between the AFL and the
CIO.
"Head the other way," the Presi
dent told reporters as he nodded
toward the placards. "There's your
story."
With the campaign over, the
President has no possible reason
to refuse to make some immediate
move to bring labor's two most
important organized groups to
gether. When he says that "we
are one people," the President
makes it clear that America will
not stand for disunity in the ranks
of labor if that disunity is to ham
per our national unity.
It is problematic whether the dif
ferences between the AFL and the
CIO are as basic as many have been
led to believe. It is true that im
portant jurisdictional disputes arise,
but many members of the two un
ions feel these could be settled if it
were not for the leadership of the
two groups.
Speculation is already prevalent
that John L. Lewis, head of the CIO,
will retire, and this in the minds of
many observers is one way to i*ec
oncile the rank and file of the two
unions. William Green, pi-esident of
the AFL, and Lewis are personal
enemies of long standing. Lewis'
elimination from the scene might
make settlement a great deal easier.
* * Â»
JT WAS Lewis who organized the
Committee for Industrial Organi
zation as a subsidiary group to the
AFL. When Green refused to rec
ognize the desirability of organizing
some industries along industrial
lines instead of along the traditional
AFL pattern, Lewis withdrew and
set out. to build up a separate union.
The two men since this initial split
have never agreed over an important
issue. During the years when the
New Deal was considering labor
legislation, both the AFL and the
CIO pressure groups had to be taken
into account and the two invariably
brought conflicting demands to
Congress.
But many observers continue to
believe that the basic conflict is not
one between two organized groups of
working men, but. a struggle be
tween the dynamic personalities of
Green and Lewis.
At a time when public opinion de
mands national unity, the settlement
of the AFL-CIO conflict is more
likely. If the President suggests
strongly that national unity cannot
be imperiled by a continuation of the
conflict, as it seems he will, one im
portant step toward national unity
will have been made.
No two men will be permitted to
imperil the welfare of an entire
people.
