'DIGNIFIED RALLY'
,In commenting on the first use of
the amphitheater for a rally, Kim
ball said last night, "Dr. Wilbur and
the administration have been very
generous in letting us use the Frost
Amphitheater for the rally. Their
only stipulation is that we conduct a
'dignified rally without any damage
to property.'
"We hope to make this rally the
beginning of a Farm tradition, so
take it easy on the shrubs and plants
and walk only on the designated
paths.
"We specially urge members of
the faculty and administration to
join us for this big evening and are
reserving a section for them."
