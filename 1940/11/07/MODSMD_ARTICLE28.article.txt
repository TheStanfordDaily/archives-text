# Stanford's Strong First In Vocational Guidance
## 
### VIC MINAHAN 
In the years since the Great De
pression, thv choosing of a life's
work has become an increasingly se
rious matter to college students, and
the work of guiding students in that
choice lias become a major function
of a modern university or college.
Unknown to most Stanford stu
(dents is the fact that .one of the
i foremost pioneers in the testing of
j the vocational interests and abilities
1 of students is a member of the Farm
j faculty. ,
He Ls Dr. E. K. Strong, Jr., an asso
ciate professor in the Graduate
School of Business, and the author
j of the Strong Vocational Interest
! Blank, which is accepted throughout
i the country as the foremost Voca
! tional Interest test in existence.
STARTED AT CARNEGIE
The idea of making a form to test
j the vocational leanings of young
men and women came to Dr. Strong
j in 1920, when he was head of the
Department of Vocational Education
| at Carnegie Institute.
"You see, in those days large com
panies had a hard time getting
enough skilled employees, and they
J were worried by the fact that many
l of their employees would go into
J the wrong type of work and become
j misfits," Dr. Strong explained in an
j interview yesterday.
"Well, the Westinghouse Electric

Company came to us and wanted to
know how to test their younger em
ployees in such a way that they
would know whether to put them
into production, designing or sales, j
We tried every kind of a test imag
inable, with almost no success."
Finally, Dr. Strong explained, he
hit upon the idea of giving a test
covering a wide field of interests to
men prominent in the various pro
fessions and fields of business, and
making up a Vocational Interest test
from the results.
LIMITED FIELD
"We were all surprised at the suc
ces of the idea. Our first test, being
limited to testing in only the fields
of production, designing and sales,
had only 20 items. The present one
has 400."
Much of the ground work for the
present test was done by Dr. Karl M.
Cowdery. present associate registrar
of the University. Dr. Strong came
here in 1923, and Dr. Cowdery was
a student who wanted to do re
search in the field of vocational edu
cation. He experimented with the in
terest test hi the fields of law, medi
cine and engineering, and again ex
| cellent results were achieved.
TWO REVISIONS
Finally, a test covering 17 occupa
) tions was written up by Dr. Strong
and his associates in 1925, and com
pletely revised in 1927.
"There's nothing mystical or
! hocus-pocus about the test," re
marked the professor, leaning back
: in his swivel chair and chewing his
l cigar thoughtfully. "It's based on
: factual research and the results have
â–  proved themselves to be a valid in
; dication of the subject's vacational
I leanings.
BUSINESS MEN HELP
"What we do is simply this: We
, prepare a number of questions cov-
I ering all sorts of unrelated things,
| and then give those to men promi-
I nent in the professions or businesses
which we wish to cover.
"From the results of this question
naire, we make the Strong Test. For
j instance: if a certain question is an
j swered in affirmative by a large per
| centage of the lawyers, that question
: assumes a plus grading for law. If
; they answer it in the negative, it
becomes minus for that profession.
1 SCORE BY INTEREST
"Every item in the test has a plus,
1 minus or zero grading for each of the
i 24 occupations it now covers. Thus if
j a person answers the questions that
are plu.s for law in the affirmative,
jhe is given a high score for that
profession."
The test has continually surprised
I him by its success, according to Dr.
: Strong. It was given to all members
of the Class of 1927 and then com
i pared in 1937 with their occupations.
There was a remarkably high cor
relation.
