"DOWN ARGENTINE WAY" —
now playing at the Fox Stanford
Theater.
When Hollywood producers realize
that Betty Grable's legs and Don |
Ameche's phony Spanish accent are j
not enough to make even a grade B
movie, pictures like this one will be
come extinct, we hope.
"Down Argentine Way" is little
more than a travelogue interspersed
with interminable shots of sweaty
Latin-Americans in red costumes
cavorting around in their interpreta
tion of the "Conga." The result is an
indigestible jumble of long stretches
of horse-filled Argentine field, Car
men Miranda, Charlotte Green
wood's acrobatics, views of the Bue
nos Aires town hall, and Don Ame
che in riding pants that are a wee
bit too'tight.
But this is local color, we are told.
Somewhere along the line, however,
they forgot about that trivial thing
called "plot." Maybe "Down Ar
gentine Way" is Hollywood's last
stand for vaudeville. At any rate,
it's simply a series of connected spe
cialty numbers that aren't connected.

Florida is already planning a 1945
Centennial Celebration to mark its
