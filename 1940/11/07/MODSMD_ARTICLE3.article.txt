### 
Former President Herbert Hoo
ver from his campus residence yes
terday afternoon released the fol
lowing statement to the press:
"Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Wallace
are to he congratulated. Mr. Will
kie and Mr. McNary made a good
fight. When the people speak,
theirs is the voice to be obeyed.
The Roosevelt administration has
the responsibility of government
and leadership in national policies.
Yet our whole democratic system
depends on the maintenance of two
great political parties.
"The Republican party has the
responsibility to carry on con
structive opposition and to contend
for its principles. The anvil of de
bate is, in fact, an instrument
which creates national unity.
"The election closed with both
candidates and both parties pledg
ed to the utmost national prepar
edness and to keep out of foreign
wars. The transcendent duty now
is the full co-operation of every
body in this vital purpose."
President Wilbur stated yester
day afternoon that lie had no offi
cial statement to make 011 the out
come of the election. He said,
however, "We have had elections
before, and have always gotten
over them."
