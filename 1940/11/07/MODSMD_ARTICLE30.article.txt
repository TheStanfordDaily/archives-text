# Lunch Club Hears Speech
## Professor Pictures Transfer of Lingnan 
### 
The trek of Lingnan University
from Canton to Hong Kong was de
scribed by Dr. William Cadbury
yesterday in his lecture, "Student
Life in War-Torn China" before the
Luncheon Club.
"The purpose of the Chinese gov
ernment from the very beginning,"
Dr. Cadbury said, "was that educa
â–  tional institutions should not be
destroyed no matter what the re
! suits might be."
After the invasion in the north
students stopped at Lingnan in their
journey to the South and West, ac
| cording to the director of the Canton
Hospital and head of the medical
department of the University.
When the bombing of Canton be
! gan. the attack on Lingnan was evi
dent, so classes were moved to tem
{ porary quarters in the ground floor
of two- and six-story reinforced
concrete buildings so that studies
might continue during the daily
! air-raids.
Then, with the invasion and evac
uation of Canton, Lingnan moved to
temporary quarters in the British
| university in Hong Kong, where
classes are being held in the eve
| ning after the classes of the British
university, according to Dr. Cad
! bury.
