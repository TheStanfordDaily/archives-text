# Rain Threatens Grid Chances
## Soggy Turf Would Aid Invaders 
### 
Once again a slippery field and a
wet hall are threatening to gang up
with another conference opponent,
and this time the most fearsome of
all opponents, Washington, to knock
Stanford's high-flying Indians from
their path to the Rose Bowl.
Gray skies and gentle showers
indicate there is a chance that Sat
urday's champion deciding game
may be played in an atmosphere
which would knock down the antici
pated gate receipts and give a defi
nite advantage to the invaders from
the North.
The fact that these Washington
Huskies beat a powerful Oregon
State eleven lf>-0, playing their sea
son's best game on a wet field, is
indication enough that rain won't
hamper in the least Coach Jimmy
Phelan's team.
McADAMS HAS POWER
The effectiveness of Washington in
the rain is due in general to the
type of game they play. True, they
have a passing attack
which can be unleashed from the
talented arm of Dean McAdams, but
they also have a more potent run
ning attack which strives to make
only lour or five yards a play and
moves down the field in short spurts.
And in particular, the power
housing fullbacks Jack Stackpool,
Walt Harrison, and Mike McCorkle
and Halfback McAdams add to the
Huskies' ability to ramble on a
wet Hold.
TEAM GETS LOST
For about an hour fifty Stanford
footballers and five coaches appar
ently vanished from the face of the
campus. Managers, pressmen, and
giiddcrs a little late for practice
were entirely in the dark as to
where the team had gone. Finally
they emerged from their hiding
place in the baseball shack behind
the Sunken Diamond, where they
had been having a chalk talk, to
go back to (heir regular practice
field for two hours of defensive
drill.
Norm ("Big Chief") Standlee,
Shaughnessy's locomotive-like full
back, was still bothered by a char
ley horse received in the U.C.L.A.
game and did not suit up for yes
terday's session. However, Norm
will probably be back in a uniform
today and will definitely be ready
for Saturday's tough game.
LINDSKOG TO PLAY
"Vicious Vic" Lindskog was back
in the harness today, learning his
defensive assignments at backing up
the line against Washington. Other
wise the lineup which started
against the Bruins was intact.
This means that Shaughnessy and
his board of strategy seem to be
planning to start Ken Robesky and
Ed Stamm, the boys who have
proved themselves under fire when
a couple of first stringers, - Chuck
Taylor and Jack Warnecke, were
tied down by injuries.
