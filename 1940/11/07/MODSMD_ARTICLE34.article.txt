PUBLICITY drums are booming up
and down the Pacific slope for a
little fracas that's going to be right
in our laps Saturday.
When Clark Shaughnessy's red
skin raiders play host to Jim Phe
lan's Huskies in the stadium, folks ;
hereabouts will see the biggest big
game on the Coast this year.
A Hollywood press agent would
be at a loss for adjectives to de
scribe the clash that will take
place. The team that comes out
of the battle on top will, almost
without a doubt, represent the
West in the Pasadena Rose Bowl.
Washington has had all the best
of the schedule so far. After the
tough Minnesota opener they had
the Idaho and Oregon games to pol- I
i,sh up on before disposing of their
toughest Northwest foe. Oregon
State.
Now they've had two weeks to ]
concentrate on the Stanford game.
They worked all last week on de- j
fense against the T formation. This
week they'll probably split their
time between defense and offense.
« * «
pEW people now remember the
outcome of last year's Wash
ington-Stanford game, played in
the great Northwest. To refresh
your memory, the final score was
8-5. and the Huskies were pretty
lucky to win it.
Considering this, it's a trifle hard
to figure why Washington was
handed the Coast championship on
a paper plate bel'roe the season j
started, and Stanford was relegated I
to the nether regions of the stand- [
ings.
Maybe they'll change my mind I
Saturday, but I think that Phelan's j
team is doomed to lose two more
games on the schedule this year.
I think they'll drop a very close
one to Coach Shaughnessy's bat
tered Indians this week-end, and
I think that they'll lose to South
ern California on the following
Week-end. The Jones power may
very well prove too much for j
them.
# :Jr $
r pHE above sounds pretty cocky, j
and it's early in the week to be
making predictions, especially after
the strength-sapping struggle the
Indians went through down south j
last Saturday, but there's one thing
that makes me think that the
Shaughnessymen have a fine chance
to kick over the dope bucket.
Washington has not yet met the
likes of the pass attack that Frankie
Albert and Thor Peterson will throw
at them. Take a look at the op
ponents they've run up against so
far.
Minnesota, Idaho, Oregon, Ore
gon State, and California. None of
these teams have what might be
called a red hot aerial attack. Stan
ford, with Albert doing most of the
pitching. and with Kmetovic,
Meyer, Graff, Gallarneau, Standlee
and Tomerlin on the receiving end,
will give the Husky secondary a lot
to worry about.
It's a cinch that the Indians will
have to do a good deal of passing
to whip Washington. The Husky
line, with Rudy Mucha hacking up.
will prove to he just as tough to
go through as was the Uclan
forward wall.
In addition, Washington has good !
flankmen who will not permit as I
much yardage around the ends as
did the Bruin wingmen.

to kick over the dope bucket.
Washington has not yet met the
likes of the pass attack that Frankie
Albert and Thor Peterson will throw
at them. Take a look at the op
ponents they've run up against so
far.
Minnesota, Idaho, Oregon, Ore
gon State, and California. None of
these teams have what might be
called a red hot aerial attack. Stan
ford, with Albert doing most of the
pitching. and with Kmetovic,
Meyer, Graff, Gallarneau, Standlee
and Tomerlin on the receiving end,
will give the Husky secondary a lot
to worry about.
It's a cinch that the Indians will
have to do a good deal of passing
to whip Washington. The Husky
line, with Rudy Mucha hacking up.
will prove to he just as tough to
go through as was the Uclan
forward wall.
In addition, Washington has good !
flankmen who will not permit as I
much yardage around the ends as
did the Bruin wingmen.
PUBLICITY drums are booming up
and down the Pacific slope for a
little fracas that's going to be right
in our laps Saturday.
When Clark Shaughnessy's red
skin raiders play host to Jim Phe
lan's Huskies in the stadium, folks ;
hereabouts will see the biggest big
game on the Coast this year.
A Hollywood press agent would
be at a loss for adjectives to de
scribe the clash that will take
place. The team that comes out
of the battle on top will, almost
without a doubt, represent the
West in the Pasadena Rose Bowl.
Washington has had all the best
of the schedule so far. After the
tough Minnesota opener they had
the Idaho and Oregon games to pol- I
i,sh up on before disposing of their
toughest Northwest foe. Oregon
State.
Now they've had two weeks to ]
concentrate on the Stanford game.
They worked all last week on de- j
fense against the T formation. This
week they'll probably split their
time between defense and offense.
« * «
pEW people now remember the
outcome of last year's Wash
ington-Stanford game, played in
the great Northwest. To refresh
your memory, the final score was
8-5. and the Huskies were pretty
lucky to win it.
Considering this, it's a trifle hard
to figure why Washington was
handed the Coast championship on
a paper plate bel'roe the season j
started, and Stanford was relegated I
to the nether regions of the stand- [
ings.
Maybe they'll change my mind I
Saturday, but I think that Phelan's j
team is doomed to lose two more
games on the schedule this year.
I think they'll drop a very close
one to Coach Shaughnessy's bat
tered Indians this week-end, and
I think that they'll lose to South
ern California on the following
Week-end. The Jones power may
very well prove too much for j
them.

r pHE above sounds pretty cocky, j
and it's early in the week to be

the strength-sapping struggle the
Indians went through down south j
last Saturday, but there's one thing
that makes me think that the
Shaughnessymen have a fine chance
to kick over the dope bucket.
