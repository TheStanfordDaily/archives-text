NEW YORK. Nov. (i (UP).—Pres
ident Roosevelt will begin his prece
dent-shattering third term armed
with a thumping Electoral College
victory and with Democratic ma
jorities in both houses of Con
gress, United Pre.s Tabulation of
virtually complete election returns
showed tonight.
The popular vote contest was
j close but late reports widened Mr.
Roosevelt's lead over Wendell L.
j Willkic, although Willkie will poll
♦he largest popular vote by a de
feated candidate.
The President's electoral count
skyrocketed to 410 at 9 p.m. (ET).
Tliis was 144 more than the 266
needed to elect but 113 fewer than
Mr. Roosevelt won in his smashing
defeat of Alf M. Landon in 1936.
At that hour, the third-term tick
| ct bad won 54.5 per cent of the
popular vote and Willkie 45.5 per
! cent, according to United Press
tabulations. This vote count stood:
| Roosevelt, 24,312,772; Willkie, 20-
303.850.
Republican hopes of controlling
! the House died when it became ap
| parent that Democrats had picked
up nine seats, net, with only 13
| congressional contests still unde
cided. On this basis, Democrats
would have 262 seats; Republicans,
156; Progressive, 3; and the Amer
ican Labor Party, 1.
