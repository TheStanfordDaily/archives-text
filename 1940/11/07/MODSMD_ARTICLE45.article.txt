# Card Crew Starts Work
## 
### 
After a period of one month's in
tensive scow training, the Stanford
crew has begun its practice in the
shell.
Work was necessarily limited as
the oarsmen had some difficulty get
ting used to the instability of the
as compared wit',h the flat
bottomed barge. By the end of the
outing, however, the crew had the
shell moving along well.
A great deal of difficulty was ex
perienced with the hands-away mo
tion of the stroke due to the fact
that the shell is rigged lower than
the scow. As a result the finish of
the stroke was torn from the water.
Lee Doud, a sophomore from Ta
coma, Wash., was to have stroked
the crew, but is now out for the rest
of the season with stomach trouble.
Doud was one of the most promising
oarsmen out, and his loss was keen
ly felt.
Another sophomore, Bob Schaef
fer, is slated for the No. "7" posi
tion. Schaeffer is an oarsman of
considerable experience, having
rowed for the championship Tabor
Academy crew of 1939. and he
should lend much-needed stability
to the boat.
It is hoped to have the regular
launching float available by next
week. At present the crew is pre
cariously launching from the Red
wood City yacht harbor raft.
