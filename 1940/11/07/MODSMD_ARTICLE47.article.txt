# Frosh Grid Team Preps For Cal Bears
## 
### 
Going full steam ahead in this,
their last week of practice, Stan
lord's undefeated, untied frosh foot
ball team yesterday indulged in
their last contact work before they
take on the California Cubs in the
Little Big Game at Berkeley Sat
urday.
Even at that, only two teams, the
third and fourth strings, partici
pated in the scrum as Coach Harry
Shipkey readied them for, action
Saturday.
In the meantime, the first two out
fits, having had plenty of contact
work in their games to date, were
kept free of any action in which
might receive injuries. Instead,
they smoothed over their offense,
running their entire repertoire of
plays against the bags, and concen
trating mainly on their "rainy-day"
attack.
RAIN MAY HAMPER
Although it is expected that a
wet turf in Memorial Stadium will
slow down the Papoose attack to a
certain extent, Shipkey does not
feel that rainy weather will be any
advantage for the Cubs.
The frosh passing attack has
played a large part in their victories
thus far, but they possess a power
ful ground attack as we\J —a ground
attack that will probably prove quite
an important factor in the game if
rainy weather plays havoc with
their aerial offense.
SUFFER BRUISES
Thjree backs, Randall Fawcetl,
Bob Mitchell, and Doyle Coldiron,
are still suffering from minor
bruises sustained in the Chaffey
contest last week-end, but all are
expected to be in top shape for the
Papoose eleven's biggest clash of
the season this Saturday. This means
that Shipkey will still have his dual
backfields intact, one powerful,
large quartet, and a set of "scat"
backs who are small but strike
! quickly.
With the greatly improved work
|of Jim Cox and Fred Howell at
tackles, the frosh add reserve
| strength at the spots where Cal
teams usually shoot most of their
: power plays. Cox and Howell will
I back up Jean Lamoure and Darwin
| Seeley, who have been playing some
! good ball themselves.
DRILL AGAINST PASSES
The rest of the line, with Jim El
lis and Bill Wilson at ends. Bill
Joslyn and Dick Abvams or Kelly
Ross at guards, and Loren LaPrade
I at center, bids well to give the Cub
| running attack a rough afternoon.
( Cal, however, has yet to be com
pletely stopped on the ground.
Today's drill will feature work on
! pass offense, as well as a session or
defense against California pass
plays, Shipkey is hoping that his
[ charges' defense against aerials
i which wasn't too strong in the
Chaffey J.C. game, will be in shape
to halt the well-co-ordinated Cuh
overhead attack.

attack that will probably prove quite

rainy weather plays havoc with
their aerial offense.
SUFFER BRUISES
Thjree backs, Randall Fawcetl,
Bob Mitchell, and Doyle Coldiron,
are still suffering from minor
bruises sustained in the Chaffey
contest last week-end, but all are
expected to be in top shape for the
Papoose eleven's biggest clash of
the season this Saturday. This means
that Shipkey will still have his dual
backfields intact, one powerful,
large quartet, and a set of "scat"
backs who are small but strike
! quickly.
With the greatly improved work
|of Jim Cox and Fred Howell at
tackles, the frosh add reserve
| strength at the spots where Cal
teams usually shoot most of their
: power plays. Cox and Howell will
I back up Jean Lamoure and Darwin
| Seeley, who have been playing some
! good ball themselves.
DRILL AGAINST PASSES
The rest of the line, with Jim El
lis and Bill Wilson at ends. Bill
Joslyn and Dick Abvams or Kelly
Ross at guards, and Loren LaPrade
I at center, bids well to give the Cub
| running attack a rough afternoon.
( Cal, however, has yet to be com
pletely stopped on the ground.
Today's drill will feature work on
! pass offense, as well as a session or
defense against California pass
plays, Shipkey is hoping that his
[ charges' defense against aerials
i which wasn't too strong in the
Chaffey J.C. game, will be in shape
to halt the well-co-ordinated Cuh
overhead attack.
Going full steam ahead in this,
their last week of practice, Stan
lord's undefeated, untied frosh foot
ball team yesterday indulged in
their last contact work before they
take on the California Cubs in the
Little Big Game at Berkeley Sat
urday.
Even at that, only two teams, the
third and fourth strings, partici
pated in the scrum as Coach Harry
Shipkey readied them for, action
Saturday.
In the meantime, the first two out
fits, having had plenty of contact
work in their games to date, were
kept free of any action in which
might receive injuries. Instead,
they smoothed over their offense,
running their entire repertoire of
plays against the bags, and concen
trating mainly on their "rainy-day"
attack.
RAIN MAY HAMPER
Although it is expected that a
wet turf in Memorial Stadium will
slow down the Papoose attack to a
certain extent, Shipkey does not
feel that rainy weather will be any
advantage for the Cubs.
