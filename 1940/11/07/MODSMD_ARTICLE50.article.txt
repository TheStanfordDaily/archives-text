# Yearly Pilgrimage
## 
### 
TONIGHT 450 freshmen will dust their best
shoes and hang up the bib and tucker in
preparation for tomorrow evening's trek past the
post office and up Lasuen for their first real
taste of Stanford's Row.
Tonight the Farm's 24 fraternities will sweep
behind the doors and polish house trophies in
anticipation of the first stage of the yearly pil
grimage from Encina.
Many of the freshmen will be catching their
first glimpse of fraternity life. Already they
have spent the first two months of their Uni
versity careers within one of the dormitories.
Already they have inspected the upperclass
halls as guests of Interclub Council.
Tomorrow they see the other half of Stan
ford's living group picture. And, in the main,
they will find that the differences between the
two narrow down to a few basic essentials.
Probably the most important single differ
ence is the type of living group which the fresh
man will prefer for his next three years as a
member of the great Farm family.
Each house along Fraternity Row offers a
closer-knit structure, in which each member is
accorded an integral part. Row men base some
of their best claims upon the fact that frater
nity life offers a chance to know each member
of a smaller group extremely well.
Life in the University dormitories is carried
on on a necessarily larger, necessarily- looser
knit scale. Similarly, Hall men point to one
of their biggest assets as the opportunity to
know a larger number of men fairly well.
From the financial angle, a necessarily im
portant one to a large percentage of Encina men,
the Halls offer a slightly cheaper residence.
Discounting initiation fees, the Hall will cost
each man approximately $10 less per quarter
than will life up the Row.
Most fraternities allow initiation fees to be
paid over a wide time period, thus easing thin
wallets as much as possible.
Socially, the problem of Row and Hall is one
you make yourself. The question is one of
living groups and the people in them . . . the
answer is to choose the group into which you
will best fit. You will make your way regard
less of which you choose. —W. C.

Already they have inspected the upperclass
halls as guests of Interclub Council.
Tomorrow they see the other half of Stan
ford's living group picture. And, in the main,
they will find that the differences between the
two narrow down to a few basic essentials.
Probably the most important single differ
ence is the type of living group which the fresh
man will prefer for his next three years as a
member of the great Farm family.
Each house along Fraternity Row offers a
closer-knit structure, in which each member is
accorded an integral part. Row men base some
of their best claims upon the fact that frater
nity life offers a chance to know each member
of a smaller group extremely well.
Life in the University dormitories is carried
on on a necessarily larger, necessarily- looser
knit scale. Similarly, Hall men point to one
of their biggest assets as the opportunity to
know a larger number of men fairly well.
From the financial angle, a necessarily im
portant one to a large percentage of Encina men,
the Halls offer a slightly cheaper residence.
Discounting initiation fees, the Hall will cost
each man approximately $10 less per quarter
than will life up the Row.
Most fraternities allow initiation fees to be
paid over a wide time period, thus easing thin
wallets as much as possible.
Socially, the problem of Row and Hall is one
you make yourself. The question is one of
living groups and the people in them . . . the
answer is to choose the group into which you
will best fit. You will make your way regard
less of which you choose. —W. C.
TONIGHT 450 freshmen will dust their best
shoes and hang up the bib and tucker in
preparation for tomorrow evening's trek past the
post office and up Lasuen for their first real
taste of Stanford's Row.
Tonight the Farm's 24 fraternities will sweep
behind the doors and polish house trophies in
anticipation of the first stage of the yearly pil
grimage from Encina.
Many of the freshmen will be catching their
first glimpse of fraternity life. Already they
have spent the first two months of their Uni
versity careers within one of the dormitories.
