# ...and from the Ashes

### 
THE old Cardinals is dead. •
The undemocratic, self-perpetuating body
that has hovered around the skirts of Ex Com
mittee for six years, autonomous and yet de
pendent upon the A.S.S.U. for life, is a thing
of the past.
In its place is a new Cardinals, liberalized
and revamped so that it shall be a true service
organization, made up of capable workers, all
of them selected more democratically, and all
responsible for final approval to the Executive
Committee. Cardinals, old style, was replaced
by the current edition last Tuesday night when
Excom's by-laws were extensively altered.
With the changes safely in the books, it is
too early to predict exactly what benefits will
accrue. The Daily, which has consistently urged
the revision, can only hope that its results will
be satisfactory. If the new system is shown to
possess the same evils, or other disadvantages,
it must be altered again. But its aims, at least,
are sound.
The revised by-laws indicate that Cardinals
members will be picked by a joint meeting of
Cardinals and Ex Committee; that the list of
candidates will be submitted from tryoutees in
terviewed during a clearly established period
each May; that new Rally Committee heads
v/ill assist in picking next year's Rally Com
mittee instead of having it selected by out
going chairmen. These and other worth while
reforms should make the membership more
representative, less a shut-and-closed proposi
tion.
One of the most significant changes was the
one which outlawed that fatal last clause of
the former by-law. It has provided a beautiful
loop-hole by declaring that "The Executive
Committee shall only disapprove on matters of
policy or on details if contrary to the constitu
tion or by-laws."
The current revision makes Excom final judge
of all Cardinals actions, every appointment, ev
ery recommendation.
Cardinals has come in for a solid house-clean
ing, in a constitutional sense, and not a mere

white-washing. The changes in its organization
were designed to strengthen its service aspects,
its usefulness to the University community, and
to clip its independent, autocratic sway. Wheth
er or not these revisions will prove satisfactory,
only time can determine.
At least they were made in good faith.

the revision, can only hope that its results will
be satisfactory. If the new system is shown to
possess the same evils, or other disadvantages,
it must be altered again. But its aims, at least,
are sound.
The revised by-laws indicate that Cardinals
members will be picked by a joint meeting of
Cardinals and Ex Committee; that the list of
candidates will be submitted from tryoutees in
terviewed during a clearly established period
each May; that new Rally Committee heads
v/ill assist in picking next year's Rally Com
mittee instead of having it selected by out
going chairmen. These and other worth while
reforms should make the membership more
representative, less a shut-and-closed proposi
tion.
One of the most significant changes was the
one which outlawed that fatal last clause of
the former by-law. It has provided a beautiful
loop-hole by declaring that "The Executive
Committee shall only disapprove on matters of
policy or on details if contrary to the constitu
tion or by-laws."
The current revision makes Excom final judge
of all Cardinals actions, every appointment, ev
ery recommendation.
Cardinals has come in for a solid house-clean
ing, in a constitutional sense, and not a mere

white-washing. The changes in its organization
were designed to strengthen its service aspects,
its usefulness to the University community, and
to clip its independent, autocratic sway. Wheth
er or not these revisions will prove satisfactory,
only time can determine.
At least they were made in good faith.
THE old Cardinals is dead. •
The undemocratic, self-perpetuating body
that has hovered around the skirts of Ex Com
mittee for six years, autonomous and yet de
pendent upon the A.S.S.U. for life, is a thing
of the past.
In its place is a new Cardinals, liberalized
and revamped so that it shall be a true service
organization, made up of capable workers, all
of them selected more democratically, and all
responsible for final approval to the Executive
Committee. Cardinals, old style, was replaced
by the current edition last Tuesday night when
Excom's by-laws were extensively altered.
With the changes safely in the books, it is
too early to predict exactly what benefits will
accrue. The Daily, which has consistently urged
the revision, can only hope that its results will
be satisfactory. If the new system is shown to
possess the same evils, or other disadvantages,
it must be altered again. But its aims, at least,
