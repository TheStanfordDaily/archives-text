# File but Don't Forget
## 
### 
WHEN Betty Avery and Jim Mack were
handed the difficult task of organizing and
setting into operation the long-debated card-file
system of appointments three weeks ago, the
burden of proof—that the card files would work
—'"was slipped to them along with the major
duty of organization.
Next Tuesday the co-chairmen will return
a completed job to Excom for approval. At the
same time the burden of making the democratic
card-file system work will become a student
body responsibility.
The co-chairmen have completed a herculean
bit of work with gratifying results. But making
the system and its various ramifications a suc
cess cannot be a two-man job.
The system can work. Betty Avery and Jim
Mack have shown that. A little student assist
ance will push card-files past its first and hard
est year and along the well-paved road to final
success.—W. C.
