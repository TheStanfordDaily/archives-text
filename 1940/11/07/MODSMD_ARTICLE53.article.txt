UTILITIES MAN. WHAT NOW?
does Willkie go from here? What sort of
businesses do defeated presidential candidates
take up when they find they haven't kissed enough
babies?
In previous instances this problem has not been so
difficult to solve. When John Q. Electoralvote gave
ex-President Hoover the go-bye, all he had to do
was retire with the usual dignity which haloes an
ex-president. Mr. Hoover was and is financially fairly
well to do—to put it as mildly as possible. He had
live or six—or a couple of dozen—nest eggs to fall
back on.
And take Landon—which Roosevelt did. He was
and still is a dyed-in-the-wool politician with no small
amount of cash lying close at hand. And no matter
what happens, no matter which way the election
plunges, Landon can still be a politician.
But Willkie just doesn't work like that. He didn't
inherit wealth. He wasn't a politician before the
Republicans drafted him to service. Willkie has al
ways worked for his living. And he gave up his job
when his campaign reached the "pi*omising" stage.
Now he has no job, no presidency, no nothing ex
cept a lot of Democrats who will be watching what
he does.
What will Willkie do for a job? Who is going to
hire "one slightly used" presidential candidate? Will
kie has by this campaign made definite political friends
and enemies. In view of these political enemies,
where will Willkie fit in?
It's an unanswerable question, which, as newspa
per columns usually say, the next few months alone
can answer.

speaking of the election, Mr. Gallup Poll got
just as nastily accurate as possible. He polled
our native California's vote to within two-tenths of
one per cent. That's closer than bedmates in a sub
marine.
Also, Dan Clark, who used to instruct journalism
students down on the Farm, recently took up this
polling business. He predicted San Francisco's vote to
within one-half of one per cent.
Now here really is a way to make money. If you
could get as accurate a poll which would pick the
winner in a horse race you would think you had a
gold mine. Why can't you do the same with elec
tions?
Somebody did. Herm Silverman, the guy who com
piles all the local polls for The Dialy, checked the
polls, and then ran around betting all he could on
Roosevelt. Today he is 11 dollars richer.
All of which isn't a very ethereal way to talk of
a Presidential election.

Last Tuesday the Sophomore Cotillion (tomorrow
night with Carmene) people threw a lot of candy out
of an English Comer window. In one of those pieces
was wrapped a certificate awarding the holder a
free $3 bid to the Cotillion.
And here's the tear-jerker. The guy who caught
that piece in the scramble broke his expensive glasses
doing it.
