# CAMPUS OPINION
## NO POLITICS

r JpHE EDITOR, SIR:
In answer to D.B.'s recent cryptic statement, we
would like to point out that the order of candidates
followed in the Stanford "straw" ballot was that of
the official ballot for the California Eighth Congres
sional District.
And as to motive, we may happily state that the
framers of the poll were and are third termites, and
so the implication that the Willkie Volunteers (now
the demoralized victims of a mechanized political
army) sinisterly placed the name of Eleanor's husband
last on the ballot, must fail for lack of substantiation.
