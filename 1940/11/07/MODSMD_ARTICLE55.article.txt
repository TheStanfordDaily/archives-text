# LEST WE FORGET
## 
### 
HPHE EDITOR, SIR:
Bob Low in today's History column has ex
pressed what I feel sure has been in the minds of a
good many thinking Americans during the past few
months. That America is greater than any and all of
its parts is not merely wistful idealism but sound
democratic tradition and practical political theory.
Yet all too often in the heat of interfactional strife
we tend to lose sight of this.
Class hatred has been one of the chief talking
points of this presidential campaign—even while both
parties claim they are striving for national unity.
But, as Mr. Low pointed out, there can be no democ
racy without vital oppositions. The American way of
life is magnanimous enough to encompass Republican
and Democrat, industrialist and laborers, black man
and white. Christian and Jew. It is big enough to
sustain all the conflicts of these groups and from their
very disagreements draw the elements that make
democracy in this country great.
But this is only possible if. in the midst of these
relatively trivial disputes, we can keep our sense of
perspective and not fall prey to the provincialism
that is the strongest force for disunity in America.
Lest we forget.
Very truly yours,
B H.
