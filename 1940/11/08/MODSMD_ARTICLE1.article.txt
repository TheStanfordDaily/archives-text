blockade of the Brit
ish Isles may be approaching
the stage of effectiveness that will
imperil Britain's vital communica
tion lanes with.the outside world.
Since the outset of the war in
September 1939, Germany has claim
ed an imposing lLst of British ships
sunk by Nazi submarines, raiders,
and aircraft, though reports from
London have consistently minimized
British losses. Spokesmen for the
British Cabinet, in fact, have claim- |
ed that Britain's new ships—seized I
from Nazi-conquered nations or re- I
eently constructed—more than equal
losses at the hands of the German
instruments of blockade.
But dispatches from Dublin, Ber- J
Jin, and New York yesterday indi
cated that the German blockade is
becoming more of a menace than
the British heretofore have been
willing to admit.
In Dublin, Prime Minister Eamon
DeValera rejected British demands
for Irish naval bases in no uncertain
terms. He said:
"Any attempt to bring pressure
to bear on us by any of the bel
ligerents, inclining Great Brit
ain, would only lead to blood
shod. As long as this government
remains in office we shall defend
our rights."

W HAT
is significant is that the
British government considered
the Nazi submarine menace in the
North Atlantic of such proportions
as to bring a request in London for
bases in Ireland to place the de
fending fleet in a more strategic po
sition. Several days ago Prime Min
ister Winston Churchill intimated
that the British fleet was fighting
German submarines in the North
Atlantic at a disadvantage without
bases in the Irish Free State.
These words from the British
Prime Minister seemed to be
"soundings" as to the possibility of
securing these bases. DeValera said
"no" almost before Churchill's words
reached the Irish people. Not all is
well with British defenses when ex
perienced statesmen risk antagoniz
ing the Irish Free State at a time
like the present.
The report from Berlin which in
dicates that blockade warfare is
taking a considerable toll disclosed
that "German bombing planes and
coastal guns have sunk two ships
and crippled a cruiser and 17 other
vessels during the last 36 hours in
a stepped-up offensive against Brit
ish shipping."
In the first, months of the war,
German reports of British shipping
losses were continually proved to be
erroneous by the British. But
lately, German claims have not been
refuted by the British with anything
like the same degree of certainty,
and in fact German claims more
often than not have been admitted
some time later in the British press.
So even if yesterday's claims
from Berlin were greatly exag
gerated, they cannot be passed off.
It may be assumed upon the rec
ord of the past few months that
they contain enough validity to
make them significant.

New York came the report
that a Nazi sea raider of the
Graf Spce type was "leisurely" at
tacking British convoys en route
from Canada to English ports.
Distress signals were received
from two British ships which re
ported their positions as mid-way
between the coast of Newfoundland
and the English ports of destina
t ion.
Meanwhile the official German ra
dio asserted two British steamers
had been badly damaged by Nazi
warships in the North Atlantic only
100 miles off the Newfoundland
coast. The German assertion that
the attack occurred only 100 miles
from land was without doubt inac
curate, for it would be absurd for
the Germans to disclose the true
position of the skirmish with Brit
ish warships ranging the Atlantic.
But regardless of the conflicting
position reports, it seems from both
New York and Berlin reports that
German warships arc raiding in the
North Atlantic with some success.
