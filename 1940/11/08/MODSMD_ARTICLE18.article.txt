# Farm Players Score Again With 'Of Thee'
## 
### DIXON ADAMS 
The final cui'tain last night in
Memorial Hall on the Stanford
Players' presentation of "Of Thee 1
Sing" proved the Kaufman, Rys
kind, Gershwin musical comedy to
be one of the group's greatest suc
cesses. Co-operation between a very
large cast, staging, and costuming
were smooth throughout.
Harold Millen in the leading role
of John P. Wintergreen was excel
lently cast, looking, acting, and
singing the part. Appearing for the
first time on the Memorial Hall
stage, Millen was not quite as pol
ished as some of the supporting
cast, but he will undoubtedly be
come one of Stanford's outstanding
actors.
VILLAINESS GOOD
Yvonne Hazlett as Diana Deve
reux, the villainess from the South,
acted the part capably but was
somewhat harsh in song. Edna Fol
som as Mary Turner, was the effi
cient yet domestic secretary who
captures the heart of the president,
giving the part a touch of the pro
fessional actress.
Dana Winters repeated his past
dramatic triumphs as the much
forgotten vice-presidential candi
date, Alexander Tlirottlebottom, giv
ing the best comic interpretation in
the performance. Brad Young as
Matthew Arnold Fulton, filled his
part better after the election gave
Wintergreen the presidency and the
part required full confidence. Had
I he acted with a little confusion and
I embarrassment over Throttlebot
| tom's name, the comic effect would
| have been heightened.
POLITICIANS CLICK
Peter E. Vinson as Louis Lipp
man, Robert O'Neill as Francis X.
Gilhooley, Sam Morford as Senator
! Lyons, and Toni Cafaratti as Senator
| Jones, came up to all the require
i ments of the comic politicians from
four sections of the country.
Adolfo Arias was the French Am-
I bassador to French perfection, with
, all the bowing and scraping and
temper of the Latin diplomat. Edith
| Strickland as secretary to the presi-
I dent's wife and Richard Dwan as
| secretary to the president deserve
special praise for their singing,
j dancing, and delivery of lines.
I The songs and famous musical
j numbers went over with ovations
I from the audience due to excellently
j trained choruses. The sets gave the
I appropriate political background. In
! the Atlantic City scene a cleverly
designed backdrop gave the impres
i sion of a beach resort without por
| t raying a specific scene.
