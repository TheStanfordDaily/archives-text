# CARDS TACKLE HUSKIES TOMORROW
## Cost Champs to Battle For Rose Bowl Chance Power, Speed, Passing to Highlight Display of All-American Grid Talent 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Two nationally ranking football teams, both undefeated in roast con
ference competition, one a power heavy, veteran eleven from Washington,
the other a quick firing, freshly developed bunch of Stanford Indians meet
i tomorrow in the Farm stadium to answer the biggest question of the 1911)
! season.
Who will represent the West in that liose Bowl classic next January 1?

Will it be the pre-season favorites,
those rugged, purple and gold clad
footballers from the north; or will
it bo last year's conference doormat,
those skyrocketing Warriors of
Coach Clark Shaughnessy whose
roman candle offense has bewildered
six opponents so far this year and
has brought Stanford football back
into national prominence?
ALL-AMERICAN BATTLK
Tomorrow's decisive game will be
a true battle of All-Americans.
Where in the country will the foot
ball fan find a more bruising full
back than Stanford's Norm Stand
lee, fleeter halfbacks than Ernio
Steele of Washington and the Card's
Pete Kmetovic and Hugh Gallar
neau, or more deadly passers than
the Huskies' Dean McAdams and
Shaughnessy's Frankie Albert, all
passing, punting and carrying on one
field?
Or where will there be a better
collection of slashing, powerful line-

men than the North's Rudy Mucha,
Ray Frankowski, and Jay McDowell
and Stanford's Vic Lindskog, Bruno
Banducci, and Dick Palmer?
COACHING COMPETITION
But there will be more to tomor
row's game than some All-American
performances by some great foot
ball players. If the Cards win for
the seventh straight time, then for
the seventh straight time the Stan
ford coaching stafT of Shaughncssy,
Marchie Schwartz, Phil Bengston,
Jim Lawson, and Husky Hunt will
have skillfully scouted the oppon
ents and applied their wizardry to
hitting the weak spots of the de
fense and stopping any offensive
thrusts.
However the Indian coaching
staff has pretty cagey competition
tomorrow in the person of Washing
ton's Jimmy Phelan. For the past
few years, when his team hasn't
gone to the Rose Bowl, Phelan has
made a practice of upsetting or
scaring to death the eleven which
finally made the grade.
RAIN MAY THWART CARDS
Sure to be an important factor in
tomorrow's headliner will be the
weather conditions. On a wet field,
such as they negotiated without
much difficulty against Oregon State
earlier in the year, the Huskies'
style of attack, moving in short
gainers on prolonged drives, is only
slightly handicapped.
Contrary to Washington, Shaugh
ncssy's Warriors have yet to try
their distractors, their laterals, and
spot passes with a wet ball and a
slippery field. What will happen to
A1 Cole, Hugh Gallameau, or Pete
Kcetovic when they start their heel
and toe work on an uncertain turf.
Or have Shaughncssy and his board

Tomorrow's conference game
with Washington will start at 2:00
sharp instead of the customary
2:!{0. This is in accordance with
the precedent established in the
past concerning games late in the
season.
Rally Committee has announced
that white shirts, pompons and
rooters caps will he required at the
game.
