# CARDS TACKLE HUSKIES TOMORROW
## Cost Champs to Battle For Rose Bowl Chance Power, Speed, Passing to Highlight Display of All-American Grid Talent 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Two nationally ranking football teams, both undefeated in roast con
ference competition, one a power heavy, veteran eleven from Washington,
the other a quick firing, freshly developed bunch of Stanford Indians meet
i tomorrow in the Farm stadium to answer the biggest question of the 1911)
! season.
Who will represent the West in that liose Bowl classic next January 1?

Will it be the pre-season favorites,
those rugged, purple and gold clad
footballers from the north; or will
it bo last year's conference doormat,
those skyrocketing Warriors of
Coach Clark Shaughnessy whose
roman candle offense has bewildered
six opponents so far this year and
has brought Stanford football back
into national prominence?
ALL-AMERICAN BATTLK
Tomorrow's decisive game will be
a true battle of All-Americans.
Where in the country will the foot
ball fan find a more bruising full
back than Stanford's Norm Stand
lee, fleeter halfbacks than Ernio
Steele of Washington and the Card's
Pete Kmetovic and Hugh Gallar
neau, or more deadly passers than
the Huskies' Dean McAdams and
Shaughnessy's Frankie Albert, all
passing, punting and carrying on one
field?
Or where will there be a better
collection of slashing, powerful line-

men than the North's Rudy Mucha,
Ray Frankowski, and Jay McDowell
and Stanford's Vic Lindskog, Bruno
Banducci, and Dick Palmer?
COACHING COMPETITION
But there will be more to tomor
row's game than some All-American
performances by some great foot
ball players. If the Cards win for
the seventh straight time, then for
the seventh straight time the Stan
ford coaching stafT of Shaughncssy,
Marchie Schwartz, Phil Bengston,
Jim Lawson, and Husky Hunt will
have skillfully scouted the oppon
ents and applied their wizardry to
hitting the weak spots of the de
fense and stopping any offensive
thrusts.
However the Indian coaching
staff has pretty cagey competition
tomorrow in the person of Washing
ton's Jimmy Phelan. For the past
few years, when his team hasn't
gone to the Rose Bowl, Phelan has
made a practice of upsetting or
scaring to death the eleven which
finally made the grade.
RAIN MAY THWART CARDS
Sure to be an important factor in
tomorrow's headliner will be the
weather conditions. On a wet field,
such as they negotiated without
much difficulty against Oregon State
earlier in the year, the Huskies'
style of attack, moving in short
gainers on prolonged drives, is only
slightly handicapped.
Contrary to Washington, Shaugh
ncssy's Warriors have yet to try
their distractors, their laterals, and
spot passes with a wet ball and a
slippery field. What will happen to
A1 Cole, Hugh Gallameau, or Pete
Kcetovic when they start their heel
and toe work on an uncertain turf.
Or have Shaughncssy and his board

Tomorrow's conference game
with Washington will start at 2:00
sharp instead of the customary
2:!{0. This is in accordance with
the precedent established in the
past concerning games late in the
season.
Rally Committee has announced
that white shirts, pompons and
rooters caps will he required at the
game.
of strategy an ofTense styled for such
a situation?
Another one of the many question ;
marks which will bother coaches and j
fans until game time tomorrow is ]
the problem of injuries. Will the !
charley horse which kept Norm j
Standlee in street clothes for the j
fourth consecutive practice yester
day slow him down, and will that
bad cleat cut in Vic Lind.skog's hand
hamper his passes from center on {
punt formation?
HUSKY INJURIES
On the other side of the fence— |
will thut splint on the hand of i
Washington's best pass receiver and
dangerous breakaway artist Ernie j
Steele be a handicap, and will the
recurrent shoulder injury of Rudy
Mucha's keep him from playing the j
All-American ball northern follow
ers say he is capable of.
According to Coach Phel a n, I
Washington's policy will be not vo j
stop the Indians as much as to out- j
score them. For this monumental |
task Phelan has Dean McAdams, i
one of the finest passers and punters j
on the coast, the swift Steele for I
pass receiving and fancy running.
Jack Stackpool, Walt Harrison and j
Mike McCorkle for power into ihe
middle, and Don Means to call the
signals and lay down the blocks.
SlrC.ii SCORE EXPECTED
If this is to be a high scoring duel,
Washington will have to step to ;
match the effectiveness of Frankie j
Albert's bullet passes, the sheer ;
power and startling speed of Norm ;
Standlee, the dash and deceptiveness
of the ever improving Hugh Gallar- t
neau and Pete Kmetovic, and the
side line scoots of those little Indian ■
"scat backs," Eric Armstrong and
A1 Cole.
Phelan and his "score more than j
the Cards" campaign are going to |
find that Stanford's line isn't a one- j
sided team, they have a stubborn i
and smart defensive as well as an ;
offense. A lot of deserved tribute j
has been paid to Freddie Meyer for
his ability to turn in end runs which
were the specialty of Santa Clara
and Washington State, but over on
the other side of the line is a fel
low who, though smaller than Fred
die. has been just as brilliant, Stan
Graff.
Stanford tackles were supposed
to be weak this year but few coach
es would complain if they had
Bruno'Banducci on one side of their
line and Ed Stamm and Jack War
necke to bottle things up on the
other side. Ken Robesky, who along
with Stamm has worked his way
; into the starting lineup by filling in
for an injured first stringer, in such
a capable way, will hold down one
j of the guard spots.
Physically able lo play but a little
rusty because of his layoff is Chuck
Taylor, right behind Robesky. For
those all important linebacking jobs
Shaughnessy has thp clever Dick
Palmer, as well as Vic Lindskog,
who Stanford fans think will show
All-Coast Mucha a few things about
how to play center. If Vic's hand
bothers him too much, Doug Stahle
will be ready to take over.
