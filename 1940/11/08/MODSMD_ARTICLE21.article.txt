# Britain, U.S., Australia Reach Mutual Agreement On Far Eastern Defense
## 
### United Press 
Both power politics and military blows figure in the current interna
tional picture, with the former still largely under cover but perhaps des
tined to play the decisive role in the European war.
In the field of power politics these developments were reported:
1. !n London it was learned on high authority that the United States,

liiitain and Australia have agreed
"in principle" on defense coopera
tion in the Pacific, probably envisag
ing use of each other's bases in an
(rnergency. The negotiations were
iid to have reached a stage where
a quick decision could be made if
1 rouble arose in the Pacific.
2. High French officials were
said to be concerned for the bet
terment of relations between the
C'nited States and Europe and
Pierre Laval, French vice-premier
and foreign minister, was reported
anxious to act as intermediary l>e
t ween America and the Axis
powers.
In Moscow, where negotiations
for a non-aggression pact with Ja
] hi were nearing conclusion, Soviet
leaders proclaimed anew a policy of
Jj< ace and neutrality.
4. In Dublin, Eamon DeValera,
lii ! premier, nipped in the bud a
lii itish campaign for the return t:>
Britain of Irish bases formerly held
by Britain and given back to the
Free State in 1933. The British
Badly need these bases to combat
1 lie growing Nazi U-boat war in the
North Atlantic, and in London it was
siid that United States aid might
be sought to persuade Eire to sur
render them on a lease basis.
5. Authoritative circles in Wash
ington described as ridiculous ru
.nors from across the Atlantic that
President Roosevelt, strengthened
by re-election, was considering a
iew peace effort which might end

the European war.
6. The Italian press, long in
censed at Switzerland for not
stopping the passage over Swiss
territory of British bombers bound
for Italy, savagely attacked the
Swiss press for pro-Greek senti
ments and warned that Switzer
land might "hnd herself confront
ed by the uncomfortable experi
ence which Greece is suffering be
cause of its pro-British stand."
British bombers from heav
ily attacked Brindisi, Italian base
and port on the Adriatic coast, and
R.A.F. bombers based in Britain
again blasted the French coast "in
vasion bases" and military objectives
in Germany.
The -German Luftwaffe, which
Wednesday night again stepped up
the attack on Britain to blitzkrieg
tempo and gave London the longest
air raid alarm of the war, returned
in daylight and night hours Thurs
day in wave after wave but in some
what lesser numbers than the pre
ceding 24-hour period.
