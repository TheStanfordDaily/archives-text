## 
### 
Freshmen were urged not to raid
the California campus in the pre-Big
Game activities in a mass meeting in
Encina lounge Wednesday night.
Bruce Jessup, president of the A. S.
S. U., in a short speech asked for
co-operation in the parade and rally
and especially in the building of
the bonfire.
The general plan for the bonfire
was mentioned. Jessup said that the
wood and framework had already
been arranged for.

raiding pledge between the two
schools. Because of mob violence,
California has been prevented from
holding rallies in Berkeley for the
last few years. The pledge, which
was originally drawn up by Jim Rey
nolds in 1937, was read to the fresh
men. It has already been signed by
Bruce Jessup and John McPherson,
president of the California student
body.

was turned over to Bob Dodge, head
sponsor of Encina, who introduced
the candidates for president of the
freshman class.
