# Waring to Air Indian Hymn
## 
### 
Stanford gels a radio plug from
coast to coast the night before the
Big Game, and it has Encina Hall
to thank for it. About a month ago
a petition was circulated in Encina
asking Fred Waring, the name
band leader, to play the Hymn on
his regular program on that night.
Over 400 Encinamcn signed the
petition, and it was mailed to Mr.
Waring in New York. Yesterday,
Bob Worcester and Joel Lee, the
organizers of the movement, re
ceived a letter reading as follows:
.'I am very happy to inform you
that we have scheduled the Stan
ford Hymn on our College Smoker
edition of Chesterfield Pleasure
Time Friday, Nov. 29, as a salute
to the Stanford-Cal game. Please
extend my personal greetings to
the men of Encina Hall. Sincerely,
Fred Waring"
