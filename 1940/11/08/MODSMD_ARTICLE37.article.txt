## 'Unlimited Horizons' To Discuss Science 
### 
Roundtable discussion on the
great scientific discoveries of the
past and present and their influence
on civilization will be conducted by
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, Stanford
president, Dr. Robert Gordon Sproul,
president of tlie University of Cali
fornia, and Dr. Robert A. Millikan,
president of the California Institute
of Technology, tonight on "Unlimited
Horizons," the new radio program
under the co-sponsorship of the
three institutions.
"Scienceâ€”Bane or Blessing" is the
subject of the discussion which will
go on the air at 8:80 o'clock over an
NBC Blue Network. The series of
programs are an attempt to offer to
the common man a number of dis
cussions on subjects of physical sci
ence which will be interesting, in
formative, and yet not strictly tech
nical.
In the future, programs on astron
omy, physics, geology, biology, and
other allied fields of science will fea
ture other prominent men. Variety is
the keynote of a program which
should create an interest in the mys
teries of science for the everyday
layman.
