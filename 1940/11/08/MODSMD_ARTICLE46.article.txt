great football teams come to
the crossroads tomorrow after
noon in Stanford Stadium. One will
; go on along the trail to the Rose
Bowl, the other will take the path
that leads to the limbo of teams
j that were not quite good enough.
Whoever wins, the game will go
down in the records as the best
clash on the coast this year. The
Indian-Husky battle is. in the
words of Patrick Henry, a nat
ural. Or maybe it was Sam Gold
wyn.
The 60,000 fans who will jam into
the Stadium will see college football
at its best. They'll witness a clash
i between two great football teams,
| one that gets its touchdowns mainly
through speed and deception, one
that stresses power. Both teams are
masters of finesse and fundamentals.
The Stanford-Washington games
have all been close for the last three
years. In 1937 Stanford squeaked
through with a 13-7 win up North.
Washington came out on top the
next two years by scores of 10-7
and 8-5. A little rapid fire compu
tation reveals that over the three
game stretch both teams have tal
lied 25 points.
The records of the two teams
this year are tops on the Pacific
Coast. Undefeated Stanford against
once-beaten Washington.

'J'MIE matter of rain has been keep
ing Stanford on the edge of its
collective chair all week. Latest
forecasts say that it will clear up
today and the game will be played
on a dry, fast field.
Clark Shaughnessy doesn't ap
pear very worried about that as
pect of the situation. He has been
quoted as saying "We'll both han
dle the same ball."
There's no arguing with that state
ment, but there's also no denying
the fact that mud would give the
speedy Stanford backs some trouble.

| Pete Kmetovic and A1 Cole slipped
I and fell down several times in the
Coliseum last week on a relatively
dry track.
Also handicapped would be the
Stanford passing game. In order to
loosen up the defense for the quick
breaking running plays, the Indians
must be able to provide at least a
good passing threat.
