# Farm Paddlers Down San Jose In Close battle
## 
### 
Overcoming the "jinx" at the San
Jose pool, the Stanford varsity water
polo team eked out a 7-G victory
over the San Jose State varsity
Wednesday night after the frosh had
lost by a 9-X count in the prelimin
i ary.
Playing without the services of
Dave Nottage, ace forward, the var
sity was able to roll up a 4-3 lead at
half time and managed to hold onto
the margin during the second pe
riod when they were shooting in ihe
feared shallow end of the pool.
OUTSTANDING PLAYERS
The loss of Nottage served to Wing
Roger Manwaring to the attention
of Coach Thornton. Although he
only played one quarter, Manwaring
was the high scorer in the game
with three tallies to his credit, as
well as playing a good team game.
Bob Jones, sophomore centerback,
who replaced Bruce Jessup in the
second half, was another outstand
ing player for the Cards. Through
his play he is assured of at least one
hall of the playing time from now
!( n through the season, Coach
! Thornton stated.
BRECKNER SHINES
Much credit for the victory is due
I to the efforts of goalie Bob Breck
ner in the second half. The out
j standing player in the pool, Breck-
I ner was making impossible saves on
San Jose shots, and if his play the
rest of the season keeps time to his
work in this game he should be a
leading candidate for all-Coast hon
ors.
The usual steady game was
turned in by Mitchell, Weeden, and
Captain Marino.
In the preliminary to the varsity
tilt the Staniord Frosh suffered
their first defeat of the season at the
hands of the San Jose State Frosh
by a score of 9-8. The freshman
| lost the toss for position, and as a
| result were forced to shoot in the
i shallow end of the pool all through
I the secpnd half, whore they nicin
j aged to blow a 5-3 halftime load
BONNER I'OINT MAN
Claik Bonner at the sprint posi-
I tion was the high point man for the
i Papooses with two tallies to his
j ciedit. Price and Blatt at the guards
j and Peter Lee at the goalie spot
were other outstanding freshmen
players.
Friday night the varsity travels to
San Francisco to play the Olympic
Club, National Junior A.A.U. cham
pions, who beat them by a 13-3
count in the first game. Stanford
| has improved greatly, however, and
should give a good account of it
self. The game will be preceded
by a junior varsity contest at 8:15.
