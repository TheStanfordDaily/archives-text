# New Trackmen Head for Top
## 
### 
Stanford's track team isn't going
to rest on its laurels.
When Bill Ellington's forces wound
up the 1940 season many track ob
servers considered the Indians the
nation's greatest team and certainly
U.S.C. was the only other team in
the same class.
But building anew this year after 1
losing Captain Clyde Jeffrey, the [
great Paul Moore, and giant Stan j
Anderson, Stanford seems headed j
for a place among the top three !
cinder teams in the nation along 1
wiih Cal and the Trojans.
Under their new head coach,
Pitch Johnson, and old Wild Bill as
assistant, the Indians are out there
daily at Angell Field pointing for
the '41 season and a Cal meet that
should be the best in years from yn
impartial standpoint.
NEW FACES SEEN
New faces at Angell Field include !
Ed Hertel, Fullerton hurdler, and
Pete Ida, broad jumper from San
Francisco J. C.
"Bullet" Battagiia steps into Jef
frey's shoes in the sprints, Blair '
Hyde and Ernie Clark will hand!.' 1
the middle distances, A1 Grey in the j
shot and Emerson Hiler in the dis- |
cus takes care of the weights, Bob
Stone returns in the javelin, and
broad jumpers Peterson, Kern, and
Chambers are back.
Vein Hart, frosh co-captain last
year, will help out Sid Hayes in the
hurdles and Jim Lincoln in the high
jump.
