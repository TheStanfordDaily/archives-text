# Undefeated Frosh to Face Cal
## Papoose Grid Season to End On Bear Field 
### DON SELBY 
Seeking their third consecutive
victory in the Little Big Game se
ries and an undisputed to the
Little Four Championship, Stan
ford's undefeated and untied fresh
man football team, 42 strong, will
trot out onto the turf in Memorial
Stadium, Berkeley, tomorrow after
noon at 2 o'clock to take on the
University of California Yearlings in
what stacks up to be the best con
test of the freshman season.
The Stanford frosh are good.
There's no denying that; and in ac
cordance with comparative scores oi
Ihe two teams against common op
ponents, they will be sitting in the
favorite's seat when ihe game gets
underway. However, the Cubs, al
though they have dropped a couple
of close ones, are a better than aver
age ball club themselves.
{ I BS KEYED UP
Then, too, the Cubs are almost al
ways twice as potent against Stan
ford than they are against any other
team. That's just natural, for this is
the Little Big Game, the most im
portant clash of the year lor both
teams. The psychological advantage
will be riding with Cal, for a victory
for them Saturday would make a
success of their season, despite the
losses they have suffered earlier in
the year.
Add to that the fact that they are
definitely pointing for the Papooses
with the intention of spoiling the
hitter's perfect season record, and it's
easy to see why the Cubs will be one
tough, scrappy gang feu - the little In
dians to handle tomorrow.
Needless to say, a win for the
Stanfords would be a fitting climax
to a successful season, for it would
mean three things for the Papoose,
squad: (1) three straight victories
over Cal, (2) six consecutive tri
umphs for an undefeated, untied
season, and (3) the championship of
the Little Four Conference. And
Coach Harry Shipkey's boys will lie
out after that win.
BALANCES ELEVEN
Who will be the Papoose stand
out tomorrow? Our guess is: no one.
This year's yearling team, in con
trast to the past two Papoose elev
ens, on the Farm has won every
game with a smooth, well-balanced
attack that features teamwork
rather than a single star back. And
the chances are that if Stanford wins
the Little Big Game tomorrow, it
will be the result of eleven men
playing together as a single well
knit unit.
This doesn't mean that Coach
Shipkey lacks talented backs. He
doesn't, for, as a matter of fact, he
has not only one, but two excellent
backfield units that he can use in
terchangeably. Each of these units,
within itself, has all the requisites of
a good backfield. In the tailback
spot most of the time for the first
quartet is Bob Mitchell, truly a
triple threat back, who can run, pass,
and kick with the best frosh backs
in the Little Four Conference. Bob
Koch, co-captain with center Loren
LaPrade, is also a sturdy ball carrier
and a good passer.
PAPOOSE LINE STRONG
The Papoose line looks to be one
oi the strongest Shipkey has turned
out in the last several years, and
should give the Cub running attack
a tough afternoon. From here we'd
say the Papoose will win by a touch
down.

Stanfords would be a fitting climax
to a successful season, for it would
mean three things for the Papoose,
squad: (1) three straight victories
over Cal, (2) six consecutive tri
umphs for an undefeated, untied
season, and (3) the championship of
the Little Four Conference. And
Coach Harry Shipkey's boys will lie
out after that win.
BALANCES ELEVEN
Who will be the Papoose stand
out tomorrow? Our guess is: no one.
This year's yearling team, in con
trast to the past two Papoose elev
ens, on the Farm has won every
game with a smooth, well-balanced
attack that features teamwork
rather than a single star back. And
the chances are that if Stanford wins
the Little Big Game tomorrow, it
will be the result of eleven men
playing together as a single well
knit unit.
This doesn't mean that Coach
Shipkey lacks talented backs. He
doesn't, for, as a matter of fact, he
has not only one, but two excellent
backfield units that he can use in
terchangeably. Each of these units,
within itself, has all the requisites of
a good backfield. In the tailback
spot most of the time for the first
quartet is Bob Mitchell, truly a
triple threat back, who can run, pass,
and kick with the best frosh backs
in the Little Four Conference. Bob
Koch, co-captain with center Loren
LaPrade, is also a sturdy ball carrier
and a good passer.
PAPOOSE LINE STRONG
The Papoose line looks to be one
oi the strongest Shipkey has turned
out in the last several years, and
should give the Cub running attack
a tough afternoon. From here we'd
say the Papoose will win by a touch
down.

Seeking their third consecutive
victory in the Little Big Game se
ries and an undisputed to the
Little Four Championship, Stan
ford's undefeated and untied fresh
man football team, 42 strong, will
trot out onto the turf in Memorial
Stadium, Berkeley, tomorrow after
noon at 2 o'clock to take on the
University of California Yearlings in
what stacks up to be the best con
test of the freshman season.
The Stanford frosh are good.
There's no denying that; and in ac
cordance with comparative scores oi
Ihe two teams against common op
ponents, they will be sitting in the
favorite's seat when ihe game gets
underway. However, the Cubs, al
though they have dropped a couple
of close ones, are a better than aver
age ball club themselves.
{ I BS KEYED UP
Then, too, the Cubs are almost al
ways twice as potent against Stan
ford than they are against any other
team. That's just natural, for this is
the Little Big Game, the most im
portant clash of the year lor both
teams. The psychological advantage
will be riding with Cal, for a victory
for them Saturday would make a
success of their season, despite the
losses they have suffered earlier in
the year.
Add to that the fact that they are
definitely pointing for the Papooses
with the intention of spoiling the
hitter's perfect season record, and it's
easy to see why the Cubs will be one
tough, scrappy gang feu - the little In
dians to handle tomorrow.
