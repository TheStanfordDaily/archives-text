# Husky Sports Editor Lauds Washington Unity, Generalship

### BOB BAILIE 
(Sports Editor, Washington Daily)
After an hour's discussion with your athletic publicity man, Don Lieb
endorfer, yesterday, I came away convinced there is little to choose from
m picking the superior team in tomorrow's number one game in the
Pacific Coast Conference.
Mr. Liebendorfer did not try to sell me the idea that Washington would

beat the Indians. It was an objec-,
tive man-to-man analysis. And be
lieve me, man for man, Washington
and Stanford do not give the betting
fans very much to work with. But
my job in these lines is to give you
a few of my impressions of the
Huskies.
What kind of a team does Jim
Phelan have (his year? It most cer
tainly is not the super outfit tlie
Saturday Evening Post and all the
rest of the periodicals, experts, etc.
claimed it was back in September.
We are too thin on capable reserves
at center, end and halfback to be
called a powerhouse ball club. The
secret of Washington's success thus
far, is, I believe, the earnest desire
oi the entire squad to play good
football and do it as an eleven-man
rather than a one-man unit. Not
that the squad lacks for players of
superior ability. Any coach would
be happy to have our ends, Bill
Marx and Jay McDowell, guard Ray
Frankowski, center Rudy Mucha,
and backs Dean McAdams, Walt
Harrison, and Jack Stackpool.
Another little - mentioned reason
why the Huskies function smoothly
is the brainy field generalship of
quarterback Don Means. It was
Means' cleverness that brought a

belated Washington victory over
California two weeks ago.
In a few words then, Washington's
success is due largely to the same
intangible factor that has given
your Stanford team an almost magic
touchâ€”a splendid team spirit and
the urge to play good football. The
fact remains, however, the Huskies
will be in the poorest physical con
dition Saturday of any time this
season. In spite of ,an extra week
in which to recuperate, Jim Phelan
can expect only partial service from
four of his regulars. Rudy Muchu.
center, Dick Greenwood, guard,
Ernie Steele, left half and Jack
Stackpool will all be slowed down
by ailments, although all four may
be in the starting line-up.
