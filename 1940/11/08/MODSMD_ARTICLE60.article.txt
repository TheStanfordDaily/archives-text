# Enema 1E, 4W Clash for Title
## 
### 
Two colorful intramural football
teams from the Class of 1944, En
cina 1E and Encina 4W, lock horns
this afternoon on the new field at
4:10 to decide the all-Encina cham
pionship. The winner of this battle
will move to the all-University
semi-finals to be played Nov. 19.
Yesterday's contests saw a fast
Breakers team outscore the Phi Sigs,
23 to 12. Al Wool, member of the
frosh team when Pete Kmetovic and
Frankie Albert were first-year men,
was the sparkplug for the winners.
The Phi Sigs were good, but a good
ground game and a powerful aerial
attack proved to be their downfall.
BETAS WIN
The Betas and Theta Xi's played
off their postponed game with the
Betas winning, 13-6. The Theta Xi's,
aveti though they lost again, man
aged to give their superior oppo
nents a fight.
The all-University intramural
football play-offs begin next week.
Following the Encina championship
game tomorrow, the A.T.O.'s and
El Toros meet Monday. The Kappa
Sigs play the winner Thursday. The
D.U.'s and Zetes battle Wednesday.
FIREHOUSE VS. PHI DELTS
Tuesday finds last year's cham
pionship outfit, the Firehouse boys,
going up against the surprise team
of this year, Phi Delta Phi. Sequoia
and the Phi Psi first team play
next Friday, the winner meeting
either the Firehouse or Phi Delta
Phi. The pairings and schedules are
posted on the bulletin board in the
Encina Gym.
Last year the Zetes and the Fire
house fought to several scoreless ties
