## 
### 
BERKELEY, Calif., Nov. 7 (UP).
! â€”Thirty-nine University of Califor
nia football players left tonight for
I Los Angeles where they will play
I University of Southern California
| Saturday.
Three of them were injured and
I were just going for the ride: Art
! Anderson, Joe Merlo and Ray Arn
| old.
Doubtful starters were Ted Staf
| fler, left end, and Chuck Donohue,
left guard.

Tumbleweeds stopped a train
between Cheyenne, Wyo., and Den
/er, Colo. Crushed beneath the
wheels of the train, the weeds made
:he rails too slippery.
