# Stanford's First Citizen
## 
### 
DESPITE the fact that the only living ex-presi
dent of the United States votes at Stanford's
Precinct Number One, few students ever have
any closer contact with Mr. Hoover than direct
ing tourists from Maine to Florida to the gap
in the greenery through which the Hoover's
adobe may be seen. Most of us live on the
campus for four years without ever glimpsing
the Farm's most prominent alumnus.
Today the student body will be given the
opportunity not only to see, but to hear, a man,
who cannot fail to be admired, even by those of
opposing political viev/s, for his intelligence and
ability and for his contribution to the American
scene. It would be non-sensical to rehash Mr.
Hoover's years in the White House, but none
can refute the fact that many of the difficulties
which confronted him during these years, fric
tion between capital and labor, unemployment,
and other domestic crises are now awaiting a
third try at their solution by the present ad
ministration.
Following his policy in his last public ap
pearance at Stanford, Mr. Hoover plans to base
his talk on guestions submitted to him by stu
dents and faculty. In his appearance last spring,
he discussed the University financial crisis, the
California migrant problem, covered the Euro
pean situation, and cheered graduating seniors,
by quoting statistics showing that 90 per cent
of them would have jobs within 60 days, in his
discussion of the youth employment problem.
Today's lecture, three days after a national
election, answering questions submitted by a
group vitally interested in the domestic and
international situation, will undoubtedly con
cern preparedness, the foreign wars, and even,
perhaps the recent presidential race', should be
the most interesting and important answer to
their own "Information, Please" that the student
body will hear for a long time. Possibly it is
for the reason that these questions will un
doubtedly concern preparedness, foreign wars,
and even, perhaps, the recent presidential race,
that Mr. Hoover has requested that his talk be
kept "off the record."
Incidentally, remember that the bawl-out
lists some four thousand syllabus payers, and
Memorial Theater will only seat 1,800 of them.
Last spring nearly a thousand irate students for
got that fact and found themselves without the
red leather portals when they closed. Moral:
beat it like mad to Memorial Theater when the
bell dismissing eight o'clock rings if you plan
to hear Herbert Clark Hoover, Stanford '95, ad
dress the student body this morning.â€” M.E.F.
