# Mr. Ghost Goes to Town
## 
### 
THERE'S nothing like a good, cheerful Friday
night, I always say.
The sophomores are going to take care of it
for us this evening. They're tossing a "cata
combs party" in the Basketball Pavilion, replete
with skeletons, ghostly lights, uncanny sur
roundings, and vocal numbers by Carmene.
It should be a gay affair.
There is something, I think, a little disquiet
ing about spending four hours under these sur
roundings. There will be a fine crowd and I
would not for the world suggest that anyone
miss a whirl at things. The sophomores are cer
tain to pick up a lot of three-rock donations that
will swell the coffers.
But I'm chilled at the prospect of our own fa
miliar Pavilion suddenly assuming the aspects
of Malta, even for one evening. I find the
thought of drinking liquid refieshments -of
t iiiy kind from "the Devil's Punch Bowl" some

what distasteful.
And though the class of '43's energetic pub
licity writer assures us on the front page today
that "the strange dimness and sparkling music
will form an unusual contrasting combination,"
I'm not so sure the sophomores didn't slip a
week when they looked at the calendar. These
goings-on would have meant a little more about
Hallowe'en time.
All in all, I'm tempted to believe that Mr.
Skinnay Ennis and his music, which I know is
excellent, will comprise the most secure part
of the show.
