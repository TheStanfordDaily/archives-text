### HUD AMES 
AFTER ONE BATTLE; BEFORE ANOTHER
the smoke of a presidential election has
cleared, you begin to hear of little things, nasty
little incidentals, which when added together cause
you to stop and'think a while.
Yesterday morning, a Farmerette dropped in her
conversation a note which limelights for a moment the
pressing question of the past election with regard to
the "army" movement in these United States today.
She related how her brother, who holds a reserve
officer's commission in the army, was called yester
day to Fort Benning, Georgia, for training until June.
He's not supposed to bring his wife. He has to be
there in three days, so short a time, in fact, that he
can't drive by car. So he is thinking of selling his
present car and buying another down in Gergia. He
won't have time to wind up his business affairs for
his absence. Drop everything, drop everything; it's
a matter of hours. Rush. Rush, RUSH.
* * * *
The unpleasant twist came when he read the date
line on the order from the army. It read November 1.
And as the Farmerette put it, 'My family arc so
mad they can't see straight. They rush our brother so
fast he doesn't know what he's doing. I don't like it,
and my folks don't like it, the way they have that
order written out with time to spare on the first of
this month. And then they didn't send it to him until
after the election."
. . . until after the election.

r JpHIS rain has been hanging on and hanging on. And
things have reached the serious stage, what with
our tussle with Washington scheduled for tomorrow.
As yet, our beloved Coach Clark has not shown much
concern for the inclement weather.
But you can't deny that Kmetovic will have a
tough time cutting, and Albert will have a tougher
time passing in a cuppy field.
Right now a field tarpaulin, like they have at many
other schools, would be just the ticket. Unfortunately
Stanford doesn't have that little thing, which costs up
in the thousands of dollars.
But then again, you can almost bet your bottom
nickel that the winner of tomorrow's crasher-crusher
will sail into this year's Rose Bowl game. And Stan
ford's deceptive play needs the kind of a field which
bears that "tarpaulin-covered" look after wet weather.
The money that the B.A.C. would get from one
Rose Bowl game would more than pay for a field
tarpaulin. It might prove a worth while investment.
Of course, it's too late now to be crying over spilt
rainwater—but there is going to be the Rose Bowl
next year.
So keep your eyes on "the Indians' flying feet to
morrow, and see if they slip. And please, Mr. Ather
ton, no rain tonight.
