# CAMPUS OPINION
## PHONES AND CHILDREN 
### 
'J'HE EDITOR, SIR:
Some infantile mind sawed off all the phone
hooks in the Encina phone booths. As a result there
will be no outgoing calls except at the pay phones;
and incoming calls are listed at noon and 6 o'clock
and received through the pay boolh at that time.
The Dean of Men's office has reported that there will
be nothing done about this situation until the moronic
mind that conceived the idea confesses.
With fraternity rushing about to start, the absence
of phones will be a decided hindrance. The phone
plays such an important part in every Encinaman's
daily activity that I think something should be done
about it.
Anybody that thinks this kind of a joke is funny
should be thrown out on his ear. Stanford is an insti
tution for people who have adult minds and want to
broaden them. Certainly not a place for people who
think this kind of joke is a humorous one.
As this lousy trick was committed on Friday night
when two-thirds of the school was away it should
be an easy job for those who are interested to trace
down the culprit. The manly thing for this child to
do, in order to redeem himself, would be to 'less up
and save Encinamen a lot of trouble and incon
venience.
