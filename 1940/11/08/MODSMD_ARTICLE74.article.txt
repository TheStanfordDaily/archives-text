# ANY IDEAS. GAGS?
## 
### 
r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
Believe it or not, Rally Committee sincerely ap
preciates constructive criticism and helpful .sugges
tions from the campus as a whole. We've had a very
satisfying response to our request for sticker sugges
tions, and hope the student body hasn't forgotten that
they're still welcome. Beavers and Bears are yet to
come up, you know.
But more important, Stanford is going to have a
Big Game card stunt section of 2,500, with both men's
and women's sections participating. The opportunities
are practically unlimited, and Rally Committee issues
herewith an invitation to each amateur artist and
gagman on campus to give us his ideas on stunts.
We'll really use the good ones. Drop them in our box
outside the A.S.S.U. office any time before next Tues
day noon. Thanks. >
Pat Smith
