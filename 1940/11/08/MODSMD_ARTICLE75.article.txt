jniE EDITOR, SIR:
In The Daily distributed on Election Day, you
let down your back hair ana admitted that your vote
would be cast for Franklin Roosevelt. Well and good.
And for that matter it provided interesting contrast
to the consensus of campus opinion.
But when there arc two editorials the following
day lauding the results of that election and describ
ing the Republicans as "depressed with defeat"—that's
a pretty big pill to swallow. So you are elated Tha
oidy natural to suppose. But where do we get that
line "by 9:30 no one would have doubted that Mr.
Roosevelt had been selected by Mr. and Mrs. Citizen
completely and without reservation"? What about that
45 per cent of total votes cast that opposed him?
No real American has any alternative but to stand
behind the President in his new term, but I say: Thank
God for that 45 per cent opposition. May it sober him
enough to realize that not everyone considers him
the Lord's annointed.
Yours sincerely.
