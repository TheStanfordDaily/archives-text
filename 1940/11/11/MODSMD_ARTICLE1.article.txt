of whether or not
the Greek forces along the Al
banian border are stemming the
Italian advance, the actual fate of
the Greek nation is quite possibly
being detrmined in another part of
Europe by Adolf Hitler and a rep
resentative of his Russian ally.
Conflicting reports from Athens
and Rome on the course of the war
in the lower Balkans do not cast
any great light on the status of the
fighting there. But it is agreed by
observers in this country that a new
German-Soviet deal could place
Greece in an untenable position.
To date the Germans have not
participated in the lower Balkan es
capade, probably in deference to
Russia's traditional interests there—
and more specifically in the Darda
nelles. If Russia were to give Ger
many the "go ahead" sign to strike
at Greece from the north through
Bulgaria, Greece might well be cut
in two by a quick Nazi thrust to
Salonika, strategic port on the
Aegean Sea.
That Greece could hold out in
the face of attack from the Italians
on the east and the Germans on
the north is extremely doubtful,
and Axis pressure from the north
is one expected result of the talks
between Hitler and Molotov in
Berlin.

SPITE of new censorships im
posed on foreign dispatches sent
out of Berlin, American correspond
ents during the past two days have
"speculated" more than a little on
the possibilities of the conversations
in the German capital.
One report quoted a German
newspaper as saying Molotov's visit
will cause Turkey and the "states
lying within the closer German-
Russian field of power" to adopt a
more friendly attitude toward the
Axis.
Another newspaper suggested that
the talks would result in a new pact
between Japan and Russia and per
haps greater participation by Japan
in the war against Great Britain. It
is known that Japanese and Rus
sian diplomats have been negotiat
ing for the past month, and a Russo-
Japanese reconciliation has been
expected. Germany has urged both
nations to reach some understand
ing so that their concerted efforts
might be directed against Great
Britain more actively.

sia and Germany co-operating more
extensively to consolidate Europe
and the Near East into the Axis
