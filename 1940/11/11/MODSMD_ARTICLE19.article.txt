## 
### 
LONDON, Nov. 10 (UP). The
end of the second month of Nazi
blitzkrieg from the air finds London
in better shape than immediately
after the first 30 days of 24-hour
hammering by German bombing
planes.
Hundreds more buildings have
been smashed and hundreds more
persons have been killed each week,
it is true, but the British capital is
learning to adapt itself to front line
conditions. The reduced tempo of
the German raids has made it pos
sible for the city to start catching
up on most of the important dam
age.
