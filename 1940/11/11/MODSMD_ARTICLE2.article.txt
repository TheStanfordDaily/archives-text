# Chamberlain, Pittman Die; British Ex-Prime Minister Hailed by England's Press
## Colorful Nevada Senator Succumbs Of Heart Attack; Had Served State In Congress Continuously Since 1906 
### 
LONDON, Monday, Nov, 11 (UP). —Former Prime Minister Neville
Chamberlain, reviled during the last months of his premiership for his
Munich appeasement policy, was hailed in death as a martyr by the
British press today.
The 71-year-old "apostle of appeasement" died Saturday night at
Ileckfield House near Odiham, driven into political oblivion by ill hcatlh

and critics of his attempt to fore-<
stall the war he did not want.
NO PEACE
Chamberlain, who had promised
"peace in our time," did not have
peace even in his dying hours. Day
and night from his sick bed he heard
the drone of German bombers at
tacking London and several bombs
fell near his camouflaged farm home.
iGreat Britain and her empire
bowed in sorrow at his passing today
and the press which so strongly crit
icized his policies asserted that he
leaves a reputation of "unsullied
integrity and an example of devo
tion to duty that have helped to up
hold the dignity of our public life."
He was in a coma many hours
before his death at 5:30 p.m. His
wife and sisters were at his bedside.
DECLINING HEALTH
Chamberlain had been in declin
ing health since July 29 when he was
successfully operated on for an in
testinal obstruction. He was forced
to retire from the politics he so
loved on Oct. 3.
He was the last of the Chamber
lain dynasty and will probably go
down in history as one of the most
controversial figures, who ever ap
peared on the international scene.
Because of his efforts to bring about
wcrld peace, history probably will
record him as the prize bungler of
modern British history.
In reconstructing the events which
led to the present conflict, future
historians must seek the answer to:
CRUCIAL QUESTIONS
Did Chamberlain's policy of com
promise with the totalitarian powers
as incarnated in the Munich pact of
September, 1938, open the floodgates
to war?
If not, would a logical extension
of the policy of compromise in the
gradual .shaping of the new world
have averted the conflict?
In other words, could war have
been averted had Chamberlain not
been forced to reverse his policy in
favor of a strong stand against the
territorial expansion of the totali
tarian powers?
SENATOR KEY PITTMAN
DIES AFTER RE-ELECTION
RENO, Nev., Nov. 10 (UP).—
Senator Key Pittman of Nevada,
chairman of the Senate Foreign Re
lations Committee, shown below,
died early today of heart disease,
with which he was stricken after
succumbing to exhaustion the day
before his re-election to a fifth term
in the Senate.
He died at Washoe County Gen
eral Hospital. His wife, Mimosa
Gates Pittman, who flew from
Washington, D.C., was at his bed
side.
VARIED CAREER
Sixty-eight years old, Pittman
had a career which ranged from
gold mining in Alaska to a post in
the nation's foreign affairs which in
influence ranks next to that of Sec
retary of State.
Exhausted from his many duties
in Washington, which included pre
siding over the Senate in the ab
sence of Vice-President John Nance
Garner, and the rigors of his cam
paign for re-election, which he ac
complished by the defeat of Samuel
Piatt, Republican, Pittman entered
the hospital last Monday.
FAVORED ROOSEVELT
The Senator favored some phases
of the New Deal, disliked others,
and was at odds with some New
Deal leaders. Three years ago he
favored limiting the presidency to
a single six-year term, but a recent
reply to a speech of Colonel Charles
A. Lindbergh indicated he favored
i re-election of President Roosevelt.
Pittman then added that "our
' government does not have to use
I military force and will not unless
] necessary." This was in line with
i his theory that "you don't have to
; shoot a man when you can starve
him to death." He favored financial
sanctions against international out
lawry.

The Senator favored some phases

LONDON, Monday, Nov, 11 (UP). —Former Prime Minister Neville
Chamberlain, reviled during the last months of his premiership for his
Munich appeasement policy, was hailed in death as a martyr by the
British press today.
The 71-year-old "apostle of appeasement" died Saturday night at
Ileckfield House near Odiham, driven into political oblivion by ill hcatlh

and critics of his attempt to fore-<
stall the war he did not want.
NO PEACE
Chamberlain, who had promised
"peace in our time," did not have
peace even in his dying hours. Day
and night from his sick bed he heard
the drone of German bombers at
tacking London and several bombs
fell near his camouflaged farm home.
iGreat Britain and her empire
bowed in sorrow at his passing today
and the press which so strongly crit
icized his policies asserted that he
leaves a reputation of "unsullied
integrity and an example of devo
tion to duty that have helped to up
hold the dignity of our public life."
He was in a coma many hours
before his death at 5:30 p.m. His
wife and sisters were at his bedside.
DECLINING HEALTH
Chamberlain had been in declin
ing health since July 29 when he was
successfully operated on for an in
testinal obstruction. He was forced
to retire from the politics he so
loved on Oct. 3.
He was the last of the Chamber
lain dynasty and will probably go
down in history as one of the most
controversial figures, who ever ap
peared on the international scene.
Because of his efforts to bring about
wcrld peace, history probably will
record him as the prize bungler of
modern British history.

CRUCIAL QUESTIONS
Did Chamberlain's policy of com
promise with the totalitarian powers
as incarnated in the Munich pact of
September, 1938, open the floodgates
to war?
If not, would a logical extension
of the policy of compromise in the
gradual .shaping of the new world
have averted the conflict?
In other words, could war have
been averted had Chamberlain not
been forced to reverse his policy in

SENATOR KEY PITTMAN
DIES AFTER RE-ELECTION
RENO, Nev., Nov. 10 (UP).—
Senator Key Pittman of Nevada,
chairman of the Senate Foreign Re
lations Committee, shown below,
died early today of heart disease,
with which he was stricken after
succumbing to exhaustion the day
before his re-election to a fifth term
in the Senate.
He died at Washoe County Gen
eral Hospital. His wife, Mimosa
Gates Pittman, who flew from
Washington, D.C., was at his bed
side.
VARIED CAREER
Sixty-eight years old, Pittman
had a career which ranged from
gold mining in Alaska to a post in
the nation's foreign affairs which in
influence ranks next to that of Sec
retary of State.
Exhausted from his many duties
in Washington, which included pre
siding over the Senate in the ab
sence of Vice-President John Nance
Garner, and the rigors of his cam
paign for re-election, which he ac
complished by the defeat of Samuel
Piatt, Republican, Pittman entered
the hospital last Monday.
FAVORED ROOSEVELT
The Senator favored some phases
of the New Deal, disliked others,
and was at odds with some New
Deal leaders. Three years ago he
favored limiting the presidency to
a single six-year term, but a recent
reply to a speech of Colonel Charles
A. Lindbergh indicated he favored
i re-election of President Roosevelt.
Pittman then added that "our
' government does not have to use
I military force and will not unless
] necessary." This was in line with
i his theory that "you don't have to
; shoot a man when you can starve
him to death." He favored financial
sanctions against international out
lawry.
LONDON, Monday, Nov, 11 (UP). —Former Prime Minister Neville
Chamberlain, reviled during the last months of his premiership for his
Munich appeasement policy, was hailed in death as a martyr by the
British press today.
The 71-year-old "apostle of appeasement" died Saturday night at
Ileckfield House near Odiham, driven into political oblivion by ill hcatlh

and critics of his attempt to fore-<
stall the war he did not want.
NO PEACE
Chamberlain, who had promised
"peace in our time," did not have
peace even in his dying hours. Day
and night from his sick bed he heard
the drone of German bombers at
tacking London and several bombs
fell near his camouflaged farm home.
iGreat Britain and her empire
bowed in sorrow at his passing today
and the press which so strongly crit
icized his policies asserted that he
leaves a reputation of "unsullied
integrity and an example of devo
tion to duty that have helped to up
hold the dignity of our public life."
He was in a coma many hours
before his death at 5:30 p.m. His
wife and sisters were at his bedside.
DECLINING HEALTH
Chamberlain had been in declin
ing health since July 29 when he was
successfully operated on for an in
testinal obstruction. He was forced
to retire from the politics he so
loved on Oct. 3.
He was the last of the Chamber
lain dynasty and will probably go
down in history as one of the most
controversial figures, who ever ap
peared on the international scene.
Because of his efforts to bring about
wcrld peace, history probably will
record him as the prize bungler of
modern British history.
In reconstructing the events which
led to the present conflict, future
historians must seek the answer to:
CRUCIAL QUESTIONS
Did Chamberlain's policy of com
promise with the totalitarian powers
as incarnated in the Munich pact of
September, 1938, open the floodgates
to war?
If not, would a logical extension
of the policy of compromise in the
gradual .shaping of the new world
have averted the conflict?
In other words, could war have
been averted had Chamberlain not
been forced to reverse his policy in
favor of a strong stand against the
territorial expansion of the totali
tarian powers?
