# Rose-Bowling Cards Wallop Huskies
## Big Red Machine Comes From Behind to Win 20-10; kmetovic Scores Double' Offensive Drive Shifts to High In Second Half 
### CHUCK SMITH 
All (lu* tradition of courage and
fight which has been piling up
around the incomparable Axe Yell
during its 40 years of existence
reached a dramatic climax last
Saturday afternoon when Stan
ford's famous yell touched off tho
greatest comeback in Farm foot
ball history.
According to Gordy Nicoll, there
was no law against giving the Axe
Yell during a Washington game and
likewise there seemed to be no law
against Coach Clark Shaughnessy
and his "rolling on" Indians spotting
the toughest opponent they have
met in many years ten big points,
and then rising to erase this lead
and crush the Huskies 20-10.
Remember the set-up? Without
Norm Standlee in there to provide
the essential power through the
middle, Stanford had bogged down
three times within the Washington
25-yard line. Meanwhile, the Hus
kies had put together a 56-yard run
by fullback Jack Stackpool, a 34-
yard pass play, McAdams to Young
love, and a 17-yard field goal by a
substitute end, John Mizen, for 10
points.
GIVE 'EM THE AXE'
It was late in the third quarter
and the Huskies seemed confident
that they had exploded Stanford's
Rose Bowl dreams and that they
had solved the Shaughnessy mys
tery. In fact, they had just made
one first down on a pass play and
were on. the threshold of another
and a possible touchdown; it was
second and one yard to go for them
on the Card 29.
Then the loudest and most effec
tive Stanford rooting section gave
forth with their favorite yell.
Chuck Taylor. Stanford's scrappiest
and most effective lineman, pro
ceeded to pile up three successive
Husky attempts for that meager
yard.
SUPERLATIVE TEAM
From there a Stanford team
which deserves more superlatives
describing courage, deception, pre
cision, and speed took the offensive
to win their ball game. Hugh Gal
larneau, running as he never did
before, cut the left side of the Hus
ky line for 5 yards and then again
for 9. The Indian war drums were
rumbling.
Then came the first of a breath
taking string of three Card touch
down plays. Frankie Albert, the
ever-cool little field general whose
passes were particularly deadly last
Saturday, drifted back and hit Pete
Kmctovic with a bullet pass just
over the head of Washington's
linebackers.
| PETE SCAMPERS
Pete took wing with the ball on
the Husky 39 and fairly flew to the
end zone through, past, and around
three members of the Washington
secondary. Albert made good the
conversion and now the Indians
were within one touchdown of the
invaders from the North.
But. it. was only the beginning.
Just before the quarter ended, Stan
Graff solved a Washington statue of
liberty play and hurried Husky
halfback Bill Gleason's pass from
this formation so much that it went
straight into the arms of alert
Albert.
