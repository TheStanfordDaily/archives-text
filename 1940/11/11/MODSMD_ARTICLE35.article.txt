# Papooses Bump Cal Babes 7-6
## Shipkeymen Win Frosh Grid Crown 
### DON SELBY 
Once again it was Jim Ellis'
trusty toe lliat came to the succor
o! the Stanford Frosh. For Ellis'
point-after-touclulow n kick gave
the Papooses their margin of vic
tory as they slapped down the
California yearlings. 7-(». in Me
morial Stadium at Berkeley Sat
urday, to end their season with
: n undefeated, untied record as
well as the Little Big Four cham
pionship.
Just as their varsity big brothers
bad to do, the Papooses were forced
to come from behind to win Satur
day's crucial. And they did it in
fine style, doing their best work
when the going was the toughest.
The win marked the fourth straight
year that Coach Harry Shipkey has
piloted his charges to victory in the
Little Big Game.
Billy Reinhard, brother of the Cal
varsity tackle, almost proved to be
Stanford's nemesis as he rambled 93
yards to a touchdown shortly before
the first half ended. The play came
when the Cubs took the ball on
their own seven following Frank
Forbes' 33-yard punt.
Reinhard, the deep man in punt
formation, went behind his own
goal line, supposedly to kick Cal out
of the hole, but instead he ran wide
to his light, cut back inside the
Papoose left end, and slanting back
to his left sped It) pay dirt. Rein
hard's attempted conversion sailed
wide of the goal posts, leaving the
Cubs on the long end of a 6-1 score.
KICKING HELPS
However, the missed conversion
didn't seem of much importance at
the time, for Cal had had the upper
hand throughout most of the first
hall due to the excellent kicking
of this same Reinhard.
Coach Shipkey must have given
his boys a real "fight" talk between
the halves, for the Papooses came
back raring to go. And GO they
did, wasting little time erasing the
Cub lead. Using their T formation
offense for the first time in the
game, Stanford marched 52 yards
to the Cub one-yard line, only to
be held for downs.
But the little Indians weren't to
bt denied. The next time they got |
tli ball, Buck Fawcett, hard-hitting I
Stanford fullback, punted out of
bounds on !he Cal one, which was
followed by Reinhard's return boot '
of 34 yards. From there the Red
skins v/ent to work in earnest.
CARDS ROLL
Co-captain Bob Koch hit for four,
and Fawcett picked up two more.
Following his one-yard gain through
the line. Koch got the Papooses out
of the hole with a perfect pass to
End Bill Wilson, who went to the
Cal 15 before being brought down.
Once more it looked as if Stan
ford was stopped when, after Forbes'
three-yard jaunt around left end
netted three, Johnny Kenward
gained nothing and Koch's third
down pass fell incomplete. But
Forbes pulled the drive out of the i
fire when, failing to find a receiver
on a pass play, he tore through cen
ter for seven yards and a first down
as the quarter ended.
SCAT BACKS IN
Then the little Indians lost four as
Fawcett was held for no gain and
Forbes slipped and fell four yards
behind the line of scrimmage. So
in came two of Shipkey's "scat"
backs. Joe Mardesich at right half,
and Lee Scott at left half.
Quick-like the frosh pulled the
Scott-to-Mardesich reverse that had
proved so successful in the U.S.C. !
game, and speedy Mardesich scam
pered around right end, hurdled one
defender, and went over for the tie- ,
ing tally. It was here that Ellis'
educated toe came to the rescue as
he lofted a perfect kick over the
crossbar to send Stanford into the
7-6 victory.
CARDS SUPERIOR
Not only by the score, but by the
statistics as well did the Papooses
how their superiority over a Cal
team that played the best ball of I
its season. Stanford out first-j
clowned the Cubs, 5 to 2. and out

Once again it was Jim Ellis'
trusty toe lliat came to the succor
o! the Stanford Frosh. For Ellis'
point-after-touclulow n kick gave
the Papooses their margin of vic
tory as they slapped down the
California yearlings. 7-(». in Me
morial Stadium at Berkeley Sat
urday, to end their season with
: n undefeated, untied record as
well as the Little Big Four cham
pionship.
Just as their varsity big brothers
bad to do, the Papooses were forced
to come from behind to win Satur
day's crucial. And they did it in
fine style, doing their best work
when the going was the toughest.
The win marked the fourth straight
year that Coach Harry Shipkey has
piloted his charges to victory in the
Little Big Game.
Billy Reinhard, brother of the Cal
varsity tackle, almost proved to be
Stanford's nemesis as he rambled 93
yards to a touchdown shortly before
the first half ended. The play came
when the Cubs took the ball on
their own seven following Frank
Forbes' 33-yard punt.
Reinhard, the deep man in punt
formation, went behind his own
goal line, supposedly to kick Cal out
of the hole, but instead he ran wide
to his light, cut back inside the
Papoose left end, and slanting back
to his left sped It) pay dirt. Rein
hard's attempted conversion sailed
wide of the goal posts, leaving the
Cubs on the long end of a 6-1 score.
KICKING HELPS
However, the missed conversion
didn't seem of much importance at
the time, for Cal had had the upper
hand throughout most of the first
hall due to the excellent kicking
of this same Reinhard.
Coach Shipkey must have given
his boys a real "fight" talk between
the halves, for the Papooses came
back raring to go. And GO they
did, wasting little time erasing the
Cub lead. Using their T formation
offense for the first time in the
game, Stanford marched 52 yards
to the Cub one-yard line, only to
be held for downs.
But the little Indians weren't to
bt denied. The next time they got |
tli ball, Buck Fawcett, hard-hitting I
Stanford fullback, punted out of
bounds on !he Cal one, which was
followed by Reinhard's return boot '
of 34 yards. From there the Red
skins v/ent to work in earnest.
CARDS ROLL
Co-captain Bob Koch hit for four,
and Fawcett picked up two more.
Following his one-yard gain through
the line. Koch got the Papooses out
of the hole with a perfect pass to
End Bill Wilson, who went to the
Cal 15 before being brought down.
Once more it looked as if Stan
ford was stopped when, after Forbes'
three-yard jaunt around left end
netted three, Johnny Kenward
gained nothing and Koch's third
down pass fell incomplete. But
Forbes pulled the drive out of the i
fire when, failing to find a receiver
on a pass play, he tore through cen
ter for seven yards and a first down
as the quarter ended.
SCAT BACKS IN
Then the little Indians lost four as
Fawcett was held for no gain and
Forbes slipped and fell four yards
behind the line of scrimmage. So
in came two of Shipkey's "scat"
backs. Joe Mardesich at right half,
and Lee Scott at left half.
Quick-like the frosh pulled the
Scott-to-Mardesich reverse that had
proved so successful in the U.S.C. !
game, and speedy Mardesich scam
pered around right end, hurdled one
defender, and went over for the tie- ,
ing tally. It was here that Ellis'
educated toe came to the rescue as
he lofted a perfect kick over the
crossbar to send Stanford into the
7-6 victory.

Once again it was Jim Ellis'
trusty toe lliat came to the succor
o! the Stanford Frosh. For Ellis'
point-after-touclulow n kick gave
the Papooses their margin of vic
tory as they slapped down the
California yearlings. 7-(». in Me
morial Stadium at Berkeley Sat
urday, to end their season with
: n undefeated, untied record as
well as the Little Big Four cham
pionship.
Just as their varsity big brothers
bad to do, the Papooses were forced
to come from behind to win Satur
day's crucial. And they did it in
fine style, doing their best work
when the going was the toughest.
The win marked the fourth straight
year that Coach Harry Shipkey has
piloted his charges to victory in the
Little Big Game.
Billy Reinhard, brother of the Cal
varsity tackle, almost proved to be
Stanford's nemesis as he rambled 93
yards to a touchdown shortly before
the first half ended. The play came
when the Cubs took the ball on
their own seven following Frank
Forbes' 33-yard punt.
Reinhard, the deep man in punt
formation, went behind his own
goal line, supposedly to kick Cal out
of the hole, but instead he ran wide
to his light, cut back inside the
Papoose left end, and slanting back
to his left sped It) pay dirt. Rein
hard's attempted conversion sailed
wide of the goal posts, leaving the
Cubs on the long end of a 6-1 score.
KICKING HELPS
However, the missed conversion
didn't seem of much importance at
the time, for Cal had had the upper
hand throughout most of the first
hall due to the excellent kicking
of this same Reinhard.
Coach Shipkey must have given
his boys a real "fight" talk between
the halves, for the Papooses came
back raring to go. And GO they
did, wasting little time erasing the
Cub lead. Using their T formation
offense for the first time in the
game, Stanford marched 52 yards
to the Cub one-yard line, only to
be held for downs.
But the little Indians weren't to
bt denied. The next time they got |
tli ball, Buck Fawcett, hard-hitting I
Stanford fullback, punted out of
bounds on !he Cal one, which was
followed by Reinhard's return boot '
of 34 yards. From there the Red
skins v/ent to work in earnest.
CARDS ROLL
Co-captain Bob Koch hit for four,
and Fawcett picked up two more.
Following his one-yard gain through
the line. Koch got the Papooses out
of the hole with a perfect pass to
End Bill Wilson, who went to the
Cal 15 before being brought down.
Once more it looked as if Stan
ford was stopped when, after Forbes'
three-yard jaunt around left end
netted three, Johnny Kenward
gained nothing and Koch's third
down pass fell incomplete. But
Forbes pulled the drive out of the i
fire when, failing to find a receiver
on a pass play, he tore through cen
ter for seven yards and a first down
as the quarter ended.
SCAT BACKS IN
Then the little Indians lost four as
Fawcett was held for no gain and
Forbes slipped and fell four yards
behind the line of scrimmage. So
in came two of Shipkey's "scat"
backs. Joe Mardesich at right half,
and Lee Scott at left half.
Quick-like the frosh pulled the
Scott-to-Mardesich reverse that had
proved so successful in the U.S.C. !
game, and speedy Mardesich scam
pered around right end, hurdled one
defender, and went over for the tie- ,
ing tally. It was here that Ellis'
educated toe came to the rescue as

crossbar to send Stanford into the
