### JERRY BRUCKER 
i SEEN IN THE STADIUM
Seems to me that David Selznick,
J Sam Goldwyn, Hal Roach, and so
! forth are passing up a good bet.
They should sign up Clark Shaugh
ncssy to direct flicker thrillers dur
ing tne on season. Coach Clark's
Indians have provided more story
book finishes in seven games than
have ever come out of the film capi
tal.
While they're at it they might hire
Frankie Albert as an assistant di
rector.
Everyone in the stadium, includ
ing the personnel of both teams
and the two coaches, were sur
prised when Frankie Albert came
out of the T to sneak around his
own right end in the fourth quar
ter to gain 11 yards completely
sans interference.
Albert was laughing as he was
brought down. You see, the Indians
actually had no such play in their
repertoire. The ball was supposed
to go to Vucinich on a line buck,
but they missed connections and
Frankie found himself in his own
baekfield with no one to give the
ball to.
So, completely unrehearsed, the
Indians pulled off the best piece of
deception of the year by mistake.
TIMMY PHELAN. after having the
*" Rose Bowl Gravy Tray swiped
from Under his nose in a whirlwind
finish, had some very nice things to
say about the Indians. Comparing
Stanford to Minnesota, he delivered
the following oration:
"I wouldn't pick any team over
Stanford. The Indian-s beat us
today. Minnesota was lucky to
beat us."
Which is the way a cautious
Irishman l>l<c Pheliin would say
that he thinks Stanford is a bet
ter team than Minnesota.
There must bo something in this
Axe Yell superstition that's rapidly
growing up around here. In three
games now the Shaughnessymen
have put on their best brand of ball
after the rooting section went to
work on The Axe. Just look at Bull
