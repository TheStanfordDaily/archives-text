# Winged-0 Defeats Indian Cindermen
## 
### 
Mushy Girard flashed some of his
old form Saturday to lead the Olym
pic Club cross-country team to a
25-31 victory over the Indians on
ihe Stanford course.
The former Stanford star finished
the 4-mile grind in 22:53.3 after
trailing the surprising Bill Bost
wick into the last mile. Mush,
hanging back at the three-mile
mark, appeared to be running strong
despite intermittent cloudbursts and
finished a good 15 yards ahead of
Bostwick.
Vince Ruble, ex-San Jose distance
man, and his teammate Frank
Lawrence beat out Aub Seed and
Bob Isle of Kansas State took
sixth.
