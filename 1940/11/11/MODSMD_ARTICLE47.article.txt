# What Armistice?
## 
### 
TN London they'll be cleaning up after an all
-1 night air-raid.
In Paris each resident moves in a hell that
only a conquering German army could create
for him.
In Berlin they'll be cleaning up after an all
night air-raid, too.
In Rome Italians are being taught to hate the
Greeks so that morale will not be undermined
by lack of success in the Balkan war.
In Tokyo there is talk of striking at the British
while their hands are tied with European prob
lems.
In Washington the twenty-second anniversary
of the signing of the Armistice that ended World
War I will be observed. It will be no spectacu
lar celebration. There will be few troops march
ing on parade, no insistent music of military
bands. Instead, in a cathedral whose vaults
reach up toward a grey, stormy sky, President
Roosevelt will offer one small prayer—a voice
alone and silent amid the loud clamor of con
quest.
"Let America have peace."
Let America, in the family of war-ridden
nations, worship the desire for peace, for a
decent way of life, free from the terror of de
struction and the dread of man-made machines
that shower death on men, women, and children
alike.
"Let America have peace."
Let America, this day of all days, seek the
dream which, ten years ago, seemed a certainty.
Let America prepare to protect that dream, if
need be.
But let America worship peace, as a shrine
toward which every government, every civili
zation, will strive. Through its tenets every
member of this nation will gain; and if its prin
ciples fail, every man and woman will lose.
And with each personal loss—of life or prop
erty or aspiration—will come a loss to the world
at large, to civilization in general.
I wenty-two years ago when the major powers
of the world signed their names to a scrap of
paper, they believed that it might endure. Now,
these few years later, its objectives have been
discarded as readily as the carelessly scrawled
words of any idealistic schoolboy.
America stands alone in a confused, insecure
universe.
When, today, "taps" sound in Memorial
Church after those few seconds of silence, let
us pray that those taps will not sound for civili
zation as a whole. Let us hope that a chance
still exists for a fair way of life and a democratic
means of existence.

Let America prepare to protect that dream, if
need be.
But let America worship peace, as a shrine
toward which every government, every civili
zation, will strive. Through its tenets every
member of this nation will gain; and if its prin
ciples fail, every man and woman will lose.
And with each personal loss—of life or prop
erty or aspiration—will come a loss to the world
at large, to civilization in general.
I wenty-two years ago when the major powers
of the world signed their names to a scrap of
paper, they believed that it might endure. Now,
these few years later, its objectives have been
discarded as readily as the carelessly scrawled
words of any idealistic schoolboy.
America stands alone in a confused, insecure
universe.
When, today, "taps" sound in Memorial
Church after those few seconds of silence, let
us pray that those taps will not sound for civili
zation as a whole. Let us hope that a chance
still exists for a fair way of life and a democratic
means of existence.
TN London they'll be cleaning up after an all
-1 night air-raid.
In Paris each resident moves in a hell that
only a conquering German army could create
for him.
In Berlin they'll be cleaning up after an all
night air-raid, too.
In Rome Italians are being taught to hate the
Greeks so that morale will not be undermined
by lack of success in the Balkan war.
In Tokyo there is talk of striking at the British
while their hands are tied with European prob
lems.
In Washington the twenty-second anniversary
of the signing of the Armistice that ended World
War I will be observed. It will be no spectacu
lar celebration. There will be few troops march
ing on parade, no insistent music of military
bands. Instead, in a cathedral whose vaults
reach up toward a grey, stormy sky, President
Roosevelt will offer one small prayer—a voice
alone and silent amid the loud clamor of con
quest.
"Let America have peace."
Let America, in the family of war-ridden
nations, worship the desire for peace, for a
decent way of life, free from the terror of de
struction and the dread of man-made machines
that shower death on men, women, and children
alike.
"Let America have peace."
Let America, this day of all days, seek the
dream which, ten years ago, seemed a certainty.
Let America prepare to protect that dream, if
need be.
But let America worship peace, as a shrine
toward which every government, every civili
zation, will strive. Through its tenets every
