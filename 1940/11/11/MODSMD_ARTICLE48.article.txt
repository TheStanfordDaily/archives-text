THAT history is a quantity that knows no
absolutes is a fact known to most literate
persons. What we call "history" is merely the
interpretation that one man or a man from one
general school of thought places upon a series
of recorded incidents and trends.
For instance, certain historians take data
evolving out of America's great Civil War of
1861 65 and by their interpretation of these
facts place blame for the conflict upon the Con
federacy. Others take these same facts and
with very little effort can twist them so that a
reader rationally believes the South was utterly
blameless for the war.
By the same token the United Press dispatch
on page 1 of today's Daily which reports the

death of Neville Chamberlain is in a sense in
accurate. The particular sentence to which we
refer says:
"Because of his efforts to bring about world
peace, history probably will record him as the
pri2e bungler of modern British history."
At the moment the British press is hailing
Chamberlain as a martyr, who sturdily believed
that the policy of appeasement that he pursued
would prevent the outbreak of a war that many
believed inevitable.
This is the same British press that almost to a
man reviled bitterly Chamberlain's policies of
rapprochement with Hitler. Death removes the
sting of harsh thoughts.
But to this writer it seems that United Press
is optimistic when it asserts that the ex-Prime
Minister will go down in history as the "prize
bungler." Such a thing will be true only if
England wins the present war.
If Germany emerges victorious in the con
flict now destroying civilization in Europe, her
interpretation of history is the one that will be
passed down. And Germany's interpretation of
the facts that have made this war, and that this
war has made, are certainly bound to be vastly
different from those of a conservative British
historian.
Undoubtedly the German-leaning histories
will say that if Britain had followed Chamber
lain's policy of appeasement the war would
never have occurred.
In this short column it is impossible to evalu
ate the circumstances underlying Chamberlain's
course of action. It would take volumes to ana
lyze the condemnations and justifications of his
position.
But this much seems certain:
Neville Chamberlain's station in history de
pends upon who in the future will interpret the
facts of this era.â€”G. M.
