### BUD AMES 
. . . RIGHT IN THE NECK. THE NECK
WASHING will make it so.
Some time you must have thought that if you
hoped and prayed hard enough for something you
wanted very much, that it would finally come to you.
So you shut your eyes, and wished so damn hard
that you shook, your eyes popped, and then it came
true.
Well, in that general vein, you might say that
our "Axe Yell" is just that sort of wishing. And the
louder you shout, the better the team does.
It happened last Saturday. There Washington was
with 10 rather large points on the Cards. They had
the ball with second down and one yard to go. We
held, we held again. And then just before that fourth
and decisive play, our stands broke into the Axe Yell,
which is Stanford's alone.
* * * *
That was the turning point of the game. From a
Cardinal eleven that was taking a dumping, the In
dians turned into a spitting mad team that took away
the ball, and then charged to two touchdowns in twice
as many minutes.
It was the Axe Yell that did it. It must have been.
Haven't you noticed how it has worked in other
games this season? It was just the same story in the
Southern California game, when we were all tied up
at 7 to 7. Then came the Axe Yell. Then Standlee
powered the ball over for our second and decisive
touchdown. All it took was the Axe Yell. It must
have been.
* * * *
| RESPITE the intangible power which all of you
felt that the Axe Yell radioed to our team, there
were a few conformists who complained against such
use of the yell. They wanted to save it until the Big
Game.
Perhaps they were right to their way of thinking,
the traditional way. But, brother, something was
needed in that third period Saturday. And the Axe
Yell filled the bill.
Just how well it filled the bill is clearly shown by
what acting-captain Hugh Gallarneau said after the
game. "Ya know," he said in a strange seriousness,
'that Axe Yell was the first yell that we have really
heard all season. By really I mean that most yells
sound to us like nothing more than a roar, a roar that
lets us know that you rooters are up there.
"But Saturday we actually heard the Axe Yell. We
heard something more than just an encouraging roar.
We knew from that Axe Yell that something had to
be done. So we did it."
And that comes from the mouth of one who really
knows.
Perhaps that yell will win the Rose Bowl game
for us. ....
And if you want further evidence of the pep this
Axe Yell gives to the team, you might take a look in
Chuck Smith's football story which starts on page 1
of this paper. In that story you will read a little side
note of thanks given by Coach Shaughnessy—to Gordy
Nicoll, head yell leader.
So you can see how much your yelling and
cheering means to the team and to the coach.

Just how well it filled the bill is clearly shown by
what acting-captain Hugh Gallarneau said after the
game. "Ya know," he said in a strange seriousness,
'that Axe Yell was the first yell that we have really
heard all season. By really I mean that most yells
sound to us like nothing more than a roar, a roar that
lets us know that you rooters are up there.
"But Saturday we actually heard the Axe Yell. We
heard something more than just an encouraging roar.
We knew from that Axe Yell that something had to
be done. So we did it."
And that comes from the mouth of one who really
knows.
Perhaps that yell will win the Rose Bowl game
for us. ....
And if you want further evidence of the pep this
Axe Yell gives to the team, you might take a look in
Chuck Smith's football story which starts on page 1
of this paper. In that story you will read a little side
note of thanks given by Coach Shaughnessy—to Gordy
Nicoll, head yell leader.
So you can see how much your yelling and
cheering means to the team and to the coach.
. . . RIGHT IN THE NECK. THE NECK
WASHING will make it so.
Some time you must have thought that if you
hoped and prayed hard enough for something you
wanted very much, that it would finally come to you.
So you shut your eyes, and wished so damn hard
that you shook, your eyes popped, and then it came
true.
Well, in that general vein, you might say that
our "Axe Yell" is just that sort of wishing. And the
louder you shout, the better the team does.
It happened last Saturday. There Washington was
with 10 rather large points on the Cards. They had
the ball with second down and one yard to go. We
held, we held again. And then just before that fourth
and decisive play, our stands broke into the Axe Yell,
which is Stanford's alone.
* * * *
That was the turning point of the game. From a
Cardinal eleven that was taking a dumping, the In
dians turned into a spitting mad team that took away
the ball, and then charged to two touchdowns in twice
as many minutes.
It was the Axe Yell that did it. It must have been.
Haven't you noticed how it has worked in other
games this season? It was just the same story in the
Southern California game, when we were all tied up
at 7 to 7. Then came the Axe Yell. Then Standlee
powered the ball over for our second and decisive
touchdown. All it took was the Axe Yell. It must
have been.
* * * *
| RESPITE the intangible power which all of you
felt that the Axe Yell radioed to our team, there
were a few conformists who complained against such
use of the yell. They wanted to save it until the Big
Game.
Perhaps they were right to their way of thinking,
the traditional way. But, brother, something was
needed in that third period Saturday. And the Axe
Yell filled the bill.
Just how well it filled the bill is clearly shown by
