# CAMPUS OPINION
## THAT FEMININE TOUCH

THE EDITOR. SIR:
To Rally Committee:
Why can't the girls' rooting section always partici
pate in card stunts? We never have a chance to get
in on the fun except when there aren't enough men to
make the stunts effective, as was the case last week
end. We did all right with them at the U.C.L.A. game
and had a lot of fun doing it.
If the women helped out with the cards, Rally
Committee would have more room to work out stunts
and we'd make a much better showing for the rooters
across the way. We would be only too glad to co
operate with Rally Committee if they would only give
us a chance. We don't want to change existing
seating arrangements—girls in a block with pompons
is fine. U.C.L.A. women were seated as we sit at
our games and they did all right with their stunts. I
think the Stanford women could do as well (even
without Walt Disney).
