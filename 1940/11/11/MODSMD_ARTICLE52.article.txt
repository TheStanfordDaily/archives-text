# 'Spring Parade' Flickers Deanna In Waltz Fantasy
## 
### 
Now playing at Stanford Theater, "SPUING PARADE."
Fantastic but pleasant, "Spring Parade" is a usual Durbin production,
in which Miss Durbin sings her way out of a Tyrol village, and into the
Emperor's Palace in Vienna.
Co-starring with Deanna Durbin is Robert Cummings, who plays the

part of an officer in His Majesty's,
Army. Outside of a continual smile,
a la Robert Taylor, his acting is
ineffectual.
The Undauntable Madcaps with
Sakall add comedy to the movie,
while Mischa Auer, in a smaller
part, is his own "owlish" self, and
good for the usual number of
laughs.
If you like waltzes, you'll find
plenty of them. Deanna "trills" the
Blue Danube which runs through
the movie intermittently with the
Emperor's waltz, giving the picture
the light gay swing that is so much
a part of the Viennese atmosphere.
MISS lIITS
"It's Foolish but It's Fun" and
"When April Sings" are two of the
songs, but seem to just miss being
hits.
The lack of plot and the improba
bility of the story add to the weak
ness of the picture, but it is color
ful, amusing, and good for light en
tertainment. Miss Durbin is al
ways refreshing, if unexciting, and
the background of music carries her
through the tight spots where good
acting might be necessary.
Though the picture is slow in
paits, Deanna's life is a consistency
of adventures. From the time her
fortune is told at her village fair,
and she suddenly finds herself on
her way to Vienna in a baker's (Sz
Sakall) hay-wagon, things happen
quickly for Miss Durbin.
THE LUCKY GUY
She immediately falls violently in
love with a young officer and com
poser (Robert Cummings), gets into
all sorts of difficulty trying to at
tain his success, but all ends hap
pily in a personal review with the
Emperor, who is charged with the
naivete of the young Deanna.
Though the story is completely
unmoving in plot, it is far from bor
ing, and the background of Vien
nese waltzes with Deanna's really
lovely voice makes the picture well
worth seeing.â€”Kennedy.
