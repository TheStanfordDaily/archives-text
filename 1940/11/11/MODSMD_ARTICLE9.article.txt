## 
### 
The Daily herewith publishes the answers to the questions of last
week's "Know Stanford" quizzes.
The first tug-of-war between freshmen and sophomores took place
in 1894.
Leland Stanford, Jr.. died of typhoid fever in Florence, Italy, on March

13, 1884. He was fifteen years old at<
the time. In the Grant of Endow
ment establishing the University, it
was stated that the idea of establish
ing an institution of this kind "for
the benefit of mankind" came di
rectly from Leland, Jr. It was the
morning after his death that Gov
ernor Stanford determined that "the
children of California shall be my
children."
Memorial Arch was located on the
Outer Quadrangle lacing Palm Drive
and leading into Memorial Court.
It was destroyed in the earthquake
of 1906 and was never replaced be
cause it had always been rather
heavy and inconsistent with the rest
of the Farm's architecture.
HEAVY DAMAGE
Damage resulting from the earth
quake was extremely heavy finan
cially and morally.

For not only was the cost of re- j
pairing buildings high (it was about
$1,300,000) but the destruction was j
a severe check to the University's
development. A good deal of the
progress already achieved was sac
rificed, and the endowed buildings
had to be rebuilt at the University's
expense.
UNION CEMENTED
Leland Stanford was nominated
for Governor of California in June !
18(51. He was elected by a substan- j
tial plurality and it was in his ad
ministration that California's sup- j
port of the Union cause was ce- j
mented.
The Palo Alto Farm was famous
for horse-breeding in the early days j
I before the Stanfords bought it. This
| tradition was kept up under Leland :
j Stanford, who made horse-raising
i his hobby. Governor Stanford's
j trotters were world-famous and held
; all the world records. Each year he
j shipped them to Madison Square
I Garden in New York for the auc-
I tions and contests there. His most
I famous horses were "Electioneer,"
j "Palo Alto," and "Sunol."
The original Farm was 650 acres.
At is maximum, it had expanded to
8,000 acres.
HOOVER ORGANIZES
Herbert C. Hoover proposed and
became the first president of the
men's clubhouse or Stanford Union
in 1909.
Memorial Church was designed
especially by Mrs. Stanford to be a
memorial to her husband. The
Stanfords had visited Venice in
1884 and had been impressed with
I the interior of the church of San
I Marco there. It provided the basic
| pattern for the coloring and mo
j saics of the Memorial Church. It
was Mrs. Stanford's wish that the
Church should be the center of the
I spiritual life of the University in
that it should be the symbol of the
| ideals and ethics of the students.
The publication of the first edi
tion of the Stanford Quad was in
1894.
