earthquake of major import- j
ance has brought death and de- !
struction to Rumania during the
past few days and reports last night I
told of new-found disasters all over
the country.
According to press dispatches
from Bucharest, the catastrophe is
the worst Rumania has seen in 138
years. The death toll has been esti
mated as high as 10,000. But the
news of this earthquake has a pecu
liar significance for the outside
world at this time that may steal i
the headlines before long in Great
Britain and the United States.
The earthquake has wrought havoc
with oil wells in every part of the
country.
When the Germans walked into
Rumania last mortth, their two
major objectives were believed to
have been, first, control and ex- i
pansion of the oil industry and,
second, domination of the trans
portation system in the country to
facilitate importation of goods from
Russia ports on the Black Sea.
When King Carol was forced to
abdicate his throne, a new govern
ment headed by General Antonescu
assumed control. Members of the
Nazi "Iron Guard" replaced officers
in the old government and in the
army who could not be counted upon
to support Nazi-inspired policies in
Rumania.
Rumania, in brief, was subjected
to the rule of a small band of Iron
Guardists and a larger number of
Germans, sent into the country to
supervise the actions of the new
government.
"W/TTEN the earthquake struck
with devastating force a few
days ago, Rumanian peasants sensed
something more profound than the
physical suffering that the earth
quake brought them.
Thousands of peasants believed
that some divine force had arrived
to punish them for permitting the
Nazi invaders to take over their
country and to force the abdication
of their king.
Simple, superstitious peasants
believed their own inaction—their
failure to resist the expulsion of
the "annointcd by God"—was the
cause of the earthquake that
brought death and misery to
thousands.
So beneath the headlines of phys
ical destruction in Rumania there
lies another story—a story that ma
terialistic persons in the civilized
Western World will have difficulty
in comprehending.

N° ONE yet knows to what ex
tent the oil fields of Rumania
were damaged, for the Nazi-imposed
censorship in Bucharest would pre
clude any allusion to this vital
topic. But it is known that Bu
charest itself suffered considerably,
and many of the chief oil fields are
not many miles from the Rumanian
capital.
Two days ago when reports of
the earthquake were first reaching
the United States, one authority on
Rumania made the following ob
servation:
"Presumably it was in the main to
get control of the Rumanian oil
fields that Germany sent men and
material into that country in con
siderable strength. Crippling of the
oil output might handicap seriously
Adolf Hitler's air war against Brit
ain in particular and his military
program in general."
Whether Rumania's oil output has
lx;cn "crippled" is still a matter for
speculation.
If Germany is depending upon
the Rumanian wells and this supply
is shut off, it may be expected that
Hitler will strike quickly to pro
cure new sources.
Although Hitler's meeting with
Molotov was planned before the
present Rumanian catastrophe was
known, it may influence the dis
cussions and hasten the action that
many observers believe the two
will agree upon—a German thrust
into the lower Balkans with a sub
jugation of Turkey to permit access
to the oil fields of the Middle East.
