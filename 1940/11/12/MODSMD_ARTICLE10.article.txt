Dance is well on the way to be
coming a real "Stanford tradition."

been reduced from $5 to $3 and the
location changed to the San Fran
cisco Golf and Country Club at In
gleside on U.S. 101.
Beckham stated that the decrease
in price would mean no decrease in
the quality of the dance and that
the change of location would make
it possible to accommodate a larger
crowd than last year.

refreshing music" dancers at
