# 'Independent' Plan Designed For Thinkers
## 
### 
If, while snooping through the
Bawlout, you happen to see "John
Doc â€”Okmulgee, Hist (Ind. St. PI.)"
don't let the "Ind. St. PI." trick you
into the gloomy conclusion that John
walks around the campus in an in
tellectual fog and is a human edition
of the Britannica.
In fact, the epithet "Independent
Study Plan" is far more likely to
mean that he is head of Men's
Council, prominent in dramatics, j
debating, editor of the Quad, or even
of The Daily.
FOR ACTIVE STUDENTS
As a general rule students who
take work on the Independent Study
Plan are conspicuous in student ac
tivities, probably for the simple rea
son that the plan is accommodated
to those who want to think for them
selves and arc thinking where they
are going.
Very few students take more than
one-third of their work in Inde
pendent. Starting in the freshman
i year, the plan is an attempt to in
| crease and satisfy the interest, of
| the undergraduate and to vary the
! monotony of the lower division re
-1 quired courses.
PLAN EXPLAINED
In the lower division the plan op
j crates in small groups in required
' courses, each group continuing for
a quarter only. In the upper divi
' sion the student has two choices.
| He may either do Individual De
partmental Work, which is within
j one department for one quarter, or
| he may adopt the University Plan,
' and plan part of his work for six
j quarters under supervision of the
Independent Study Committee.
The plan was begun at Stanford
I for the upper division in 1925 and
j for the lower division in 1931. It rc
j semblcs the tutorial system of teach
| ing at Oxford and Cambridge, an at
j tempt to get back to the original
j close relations between the student
' and the teacher.
