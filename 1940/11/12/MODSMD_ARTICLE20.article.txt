### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 11 (UP). â€”
Wendell L. Willkie, addressing the
millions who voted for him for
President, urged them tonight to
continue to fight for the principles
of his campaign as a constructive
opposition vital to the "balanced op
eration of democracy."
In a nationwide radio talk broad
cast over the donated networks of
NBC, CBS and MBS, the defeated
Republican candidate asked his fol
lowers continue the organizations
they founded to support him but not
in his name.
Willkie thus thrust aside post
election talk the clubs might be
maintained to insure his renomina
tion in 1944.
"I do not want this great cause
to be weakened by even a semb
lance of any personal advantage to
any individual," he said, explaining
his request the various Willkie clubs
adopt another name. "I feel too
deeply about it for that. 1944 will
take care of itself. It is of the very
essence of my belief that democracy
is fruitful of leadership."
