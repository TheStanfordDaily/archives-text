# Stanford Does Not Condemn Financial Help for Athletes

### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
"I do not believe in importing and paying dopes to play football."
So says a Rohle lass, who aptly expresses the majority opinion of
Stanford students: that gridiron heroes should be allowed free tuition and
jobs, as long as the\ do not neglect their grades. But giving them "grades"
and ether financial aids, other (hail tuition, is to be condemned. This was

by an opinion survey of a
cross-section of the campus con
ducted by The Stanford Daily.
Interesting is the fact that this
same question was asked a cross
section before the present grid sea
son began. At that time 55 per cent
of the students questioned voted to
limit aid to "jobs." and only 24 per
cent would furnish free tuition.
However, 15 per cent would allow
"any and all aid," but 5 per cent said
"no special aid at all," and 3 pel
cent. were undecided.
But by last week opinion had
shifted with the majority favoring
free tuition and jobs, and an in
crease in the number favoring "any
and all aid." The "no-aid-at-all"
proponents remained stubbornly the
same.
In the same survey another ques
tion was asked, "Do you approve or
disapprove of the work being done
by Edwin N. Atherton?"
The cross-section voted P> 7 pel
cent. in. favor of Atherton's work. 8
per cent disapproved, and 25 per
cent were undecided. Women were
much more undecided than men,
but a larger proportion of the latter
group opposed the "czar" than did
the women.
