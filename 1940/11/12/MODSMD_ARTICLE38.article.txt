PRESIDENT General Ismet
Irionu of Turkey, successor of
the late famous Kemal Ata
turk, who told the national as
sembly at Istanbul that Tur
key would not enter the war
and that her territory, seas,
and skies would be forbidden
to any belligerents.


TYPICAL OF EVERY-DAY scenes in London is this dramatic picture of air-raid wardens res
cuing a young lady from the debris of a bomb-wrecked home. According to the caption
passed by the British censor, she was buried under ruins for more than 5 hours. Late United
Press leports from London say stormy weather over the channel may give the English a
breathing spell by making accurate bombing more difficult.


FIRST AMERICAN CASUALTY in the war at sea was the American freighter City of Ray
ville, which sank after colliding with a mine off the coast of Australia. One member of the
38-man crew was killed. He was Third Engineer James Bryan, 22, of Norfolk, Va. The United
States Neutrality Act forbids American ships from belligerent ports but Australia has no
been declared within the zone of conflict. There were no indications as to whether the
was planted by the British or Germans. Meanwhile, Secretary of State Cordell Hull a
nounced from Washington that no action would be taken regarding the sinking pending i
conmletr investirratirm


INSTEAD OF THE fairly easy conquest expected when Italian troops invaded Greece two
weeks ago, a bitter battle has developed between II Duces heavily-mechanized legions and
the ballet-skirted" Helvetian troops. Over the week-end the Greeks claimed to be besieg
ing Koritza (1), although later reports say an Italian counter-offensive is driving them back.
Another Greek victory was claimed at Konitza (2). A naval battle took place off Coi fu (3).
