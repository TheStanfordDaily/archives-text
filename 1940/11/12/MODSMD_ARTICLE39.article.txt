STANFORD is about to be invaded
by an outfit that is tops in its i
line. Come Friday and the U.C.L.A
water polo team will meet Coach
Nort Thornton's waterdogs in En
eina Pools, and the Farm will see
what experts are calling the greatest
tank team in the history of the
sport.
This particular Bruin aggregation i
Came virtually intact from four
yea re of playing together at Los j
AngeleS High. They have played
together so long that they hardly
have to look where they're passing
the ball, they know a teammate will
be there to pick it up.
When they're working right
they can keep control of the ball
for minutes at a time without let
ting it touch the water.
Just to clinch the yarn, this phe
nomenal toam was beaten last week i
in their own pool by Cal, 8-6.

JJEMEMBER that dog team that
the Indian braves chased out of
the stadium between halves Satur
day?
That was a bunch of educated
puips, nothing like the brand of
mutt that usually takes part in a
football game. They're trained
over in Sunnyvale at Bill Thomp
son's West Point of Dogdom.
Pooches trained by Thompson are j
guaranteed to protect you from J
street cars, pour tea, stay home with j
the baby, and read to your sick j
mother-in-law. Seriously, they do
everything but eat with a knife and j
fork.

r r , HIS column's nominee, and that
of a good portion of the foot- j
ball team, for the most underrated'
and under-publicized man on the
squad is senior left end Stan "Bos
coe" Graff.
ClralT is the forgotten man of
11)40. Light and small for an end.
Boscoe has put out a really good
brand of hall in every game so
far, hut the sports pages have been
so full of Standlee, Albert. Gal
larneau. Kmetovic. Lindskog. Tay
lor and Banducci that one would
think Stanford didn't have a left
end.
He specializes in stripping the in
terference on defense, enabling the f
secondary to grab the runner, is a
good blocker and a fine pass re
ceiver.

||UGH GALLARNEAU won the I
Keeble pen award for his game j
against Washington. And he's one j
boy who really deserved it. Hugh
played a great game, and actually j
did the work of two men. He was j
the best power threat the Indians |
had after Standlee left the game J
and carried the ball more times than
any man on either squad.
Lucky Louie had a very rough 1
week-end. He'd have the
score of the Indian-Husky tilt
right on the nose if Kmetovic
hadn't pirated that fourth period
pass*, just as Frankie Albert did
in the U.S.C. game, hut of the ten
games picked only four came out
right.
His season record is 41 right, 15
wrong, .732 per cent.
