# Vucinich to Replace Standlee; Indians Take Light Workout
## 
### CHUCK SMITH 
A war-weary bunch of heroic Stanford football players took things
easy yesterday. Coach Clark Shaughnessy gave his Bowl-bound Indians
a deserved rest, calling practice to a close at 5:15.
The biggest football news on the campus yesterday came from the silent
corridors of the Palo Alto Hospital, where the Cards' All-American full-

back, Norm Standlee, is interned,
with an injured leg. The report is
that Norm is resting easy and that
all he needs is four or five days in
the hospital and a week's vacation
from practice to put him back in top
shape.
This means that the big power
house will not be available for the
Oregon State game next Saturday
and many fans who were looking
forward to the battle between the
best fullbacks on the Coast, Jim
Kissel burg of the Beavers and
Standlee. will be disappointed. In
fact, "Chief" will probably not be in
a suit until the Monday before the
California game.
VUCINICII IMPROVES
Sophomore Milt Vucinich will
take over Standlee's duties from the
fullback spot next Saturday and the
"Slashing Slav." mellowed by more
than 50 minutes of action against
Washington, will have a chance to
show how well he will fit into the
scheme of things next season.
'Except for everyone
was in a suit yesterday and, though
a little battered, gave every evi
dence of being ready to go at top
speed again next Saturday against
the Beavers. After brushing up on
their offense for an hour and a half,
the squad headed for the showers
and later viewed the informative
pictures of their victory over Wash
ington.
TAYLOR STARS
Shaughnessy was pleased with the
performance of his entire line
against the powerful Huskies and of
the work of Chuck Taylor in par
ticular. The chunky, red-headed,
sophomore guard started the Cards'
sensational comeback by personally
stopping three Washington power
plays for a vital first down in the
third quarter.
Big Ed Stamm proved that he
deserved the starting position over
the more experienced Jack War
necke with his 56 minutes of effec
tive work, stopping, along with
"Bruising Bruno" Banducci, the
Huskies' off-tackle smashes. De
spite of his injured hand. "Vicious
Vic" Lindskog looked every bit
as good at center as Rudy Mucha,
the northerners' candidate for Ail-
American.
ROBESKY OUTSTANDING
Close to Taylor as the outstanding
Stanford lineman of the day was
Taylor's own substitute, Ken Ro
besky. Ken, a senior who still has
another year of eligibility, plays the
same fierce and driving game that
Taylor does and is almost as effec
t ive.
Dick Palmer, with his uncanny
ability to spot plays before they
materialize, was as effective as ever,
either floating back to be the third
line backer, or slashing in to be
the sixth lineman, making or help
ing to make more than his share of
stops.
