# Booters Seek Redeeming Win
## 
### 
"The San Jose defeat is over and
forgotten as far as the team and I
are concerned," said Harry Maloney
yesterday. But he reflected long
enough to make a few comments
nn the game.
For the first 20 minutes the team
played like champions, battling the
favored Spartans to a standstill. But
then the rains came, and after it
cleared away, the Indians had lost
their fight and spirit.
Main defects in the team's play
as outlined by Maloney were: wait
ing for the ball, instead of going out
after it and thereby losing the ball
to the Spartans time after time; bad
passing—many times the Indians
passed directly to their opponents;
failure to spread the game; and
charging down the middle instead
of working with the wings.
But that is all over and the team
has two games this week in which
to redeem themselves. Tomorrow
the Indians will take on a veteran
San Mateo Junior College team, and
this Saturday they tackle the
U.C.L.A. Bruins, whom they beat
earlier in the season.
The San Mateo game is scheduled
to start at 3:30 o'clock and the Bruin
game at 10:30 in the morning, both
on the local field.
