## JERRY BRUCKER, Sports Editor Toro, Sequoia Steam Toward League Crowns 
### 
Stanford's version of the nation's
oothali howl clashes got under way
yesterday when four of the school's
iiifst intramural teams tore up the
irrf from 4 until dusk. When the
>un had set and the last player had
eft the field, two great outfits, the
A.T.O.'s and the Phi Psis, found
themselves eliminated from any fur
ther chance at the University cham
pionship. and two better teams. El
roro and Sequoia, advanced a step
nearer to the much-sought-after
title.
The most thrilling of the two
?ames was the Sequoia-Phi Psi
contest. Both teams sported beau
tiful passing threats, but one pass
for conversion proved to be the
downfall for the Row men. The
score was 20-19, and that is just
how close the game was.
The losers scored twice on long
passes chucked by Captain Ike
Boone to Jim Adams. Adams made
spectacular running catches of both
passes.
SEQUOIA PICKS WEAKNESS
Sequoia, paced by the twin pass
ing combination of Murphy and
Wood, combined its always threat
ening aerial offense with a keen
sense of observation. The Sequoia
quarterback had an uncanny ability
of picking out the defensive weak
nesses.
The second game saw two poten
tial all-intramural players lead El
Toro to a stunning 7-0 win over
A.T.O. Frank Van Acker, all-mural
back of last year, and Marsh Weigel,
brilliant end, teamed to score Toro's
only touchdown. Willie Cannon and
Kai Larson were the mainstays for
A.T.O. This game gave the Toros
the championship of League V, and
places them in the all-University
champoinships as an outstanding
contender for the crown.
IRISH RELAY PLANNED
A new intramural sport, the Irish
relay, will be inaugurated as soon as
sign-ups are completed. The entry
list is now posted on the bulletin of
the Encina Gym. It will be a three
mile race starting at Angel 1 Field, up
around the Union, and back to the
track via the Chemistry Building.
A map of the course and all in
formation will be mailed to each
organization Wednesday night.
If any eliminated football team
wants a challenge game, the manager
should contact Bert Pike, intra
mural manager, at his office in the
Encina Gym or at 24319 for a field
and referee.
