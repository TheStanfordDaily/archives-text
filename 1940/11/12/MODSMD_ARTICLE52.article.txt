### 
NEW YORK. Nov. 11 (UP).—This
can he clincher week in four of the
nation's seven major football con
ferences, with Stanford, Minnesota,
! Texas Aggies and Utah assuring
themselves of at least title ties if
they knock off Saturday's opponents.
It can be a double clincher for
I Stanford, surprise team of 1940. I
Should the Indians defeat Oregon
State at Palo Alto this triumph is
virtually certain to secure later rec- 1
ognition as Pacific Coast Conference
champion and Rose Bowl defender. ;
Victory over Oregon State would
give the Indians six straight con
ference wins this season, and even
should they lose their last game to
California on Nov. 23, Washington
! would be the only squad with a
! chance to tie them. However, Stan
ford beat Washington last week, and
in case of a tie at the season's end,
conference balloting can be expected
to follow custom and pick Stanford
over Washington for the Rose Bowl.
Minnesota can assure itself at
least a tie for the Big Ten crown
by beating Purdue this week at
Minneapolis. After such a victory,
! the Golden Gophers could lose their
I last game to Wisconsin on Nov. 23,
; and still wind up in no worse than
| a deadlock with the winner of this
I week's Michigan-Northwestern tilt.
