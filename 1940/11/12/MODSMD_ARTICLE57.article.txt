# Bellwether on the Ball
## 
### 
BELLWETHER'S gaze was gently approving.
The old sage implied a tinge of raptured
amazement in the lift of the tufted Bellwether
eyebrows. "Laddie," he murmured, "this is
wonderful. Imagine your studying in this hal
lowed spot!"
Since the great one had taken to wearing
rubber-soled shoes to classes, I never had been
able to detect his approach. I had not even an
inkling of his presence until the Bellwether fore
finger rendered an approving tap upon my
shoulder.
I looked around. The bench of the Inner
Quad was littered with bits of paper covered
with mystic figures in what I fondly term my
handwriting. The pencil in my fingers was
worn to a stub.
"Bellwether," I wondered, "what sort of guff
is this? Why all this eulogy in my behalf?"
"Simple," deduced the great one. "You've
been studying, of course. Probably for some
sort of math mid-term." The Bellwether smile
was condescending.
My answering grin was positively shameful.
"But, Bellwether," I chortled, "you're off on the
beam. I've been figuring out the scores on
these football cards! Think I'll make a bit of
coin this week-end."
The crestfallen gleam in the Bellwether eye
was swiftly changed to a glint of attrition. The
Bellwether forefinger lashed out beneath my
shrinking nose.
"Laddie," he cried, "have you fallen so low?"
"Low?" I was a bit off the beam. "You mean
in a sort of financial way? Well, I admit I am
a . . ."
Even the great man winced at that one. "Lad
die," he continued, taking a firmer grip on my
shoulder. "I was referring to the more intrinsic
aspects of the racket. Of course you knew that
you are aiding and abetting a lottery?"
"Well, you see, I, ah . . ."
"Oh, you didn't? Then probably you knew
it was all against the law?"
I peered beneath the surrounding shrubbery
for a policeman. "Bellwether, are you . .
"Yes, I'm sure. Besides, it's contrary to the
statutes of the University. You know those fel
lows distributing the cards haven't gotten clear
ance through the Administration. That makes
you an accessory to the fact. You knew that,
didn't you?"
I thought that one over. "Well, Emery . . ."
The sage continued. "Besides, you're putting
collegiate football on a par with horse-racing
and the parimutuels, It cheapens the sport in
the eyes of the public, even the gambling pub
lic. How about that?"
"Well, now, I think . . ."
"Of course you agree. So would the rest of
your card-betters if they thought it over. Be
sides, you don't win on the fool things. Last
week the local lottery chief took in almost a
thousand bucks and paid out about $400."
"Okeh, Bellwether, maybe you're . . ."
"Certainly I'm right. Hand me that card and
get along with you."
I handed him the card. Then:
"Hmmmm."
"Hmmmm?"
Hmmmm! What do you think of Podunk vs.
Clunkdale and seven points?"—W. C.
BELLWETHER'S gaze was gently approving.

didn't you?"
I thought that one over. "Well, Emery . . ."
The sage continued. "Besides, you're putting
collegiate football on a par with horse-racing
and the parimutuels, It cheapens the sport in
the eyes of the public, even the gambling pub
lic. How about that?"
"Well, now, I think . . ."
"Of course you agree. So would the rest of
your card-betters if they thought it over. Be
sides, you don't win on the fool things. Last
week the local lottery chief took in almost a
thousand bucks and paid out about $400."
"Okeh, Bellwether, maybe you're . . ."
"Certainly I'm right. Hand me that card and
get along with you."
I handed him the card. Then:
"Hmmmm."
"Hmmmm?"
Hmmmm! What do you think of Podunk vs.
Clunkdale and seven points?"—W. C.
BELLWETHER'S gaze was gently approving.
The old sage implied a tinge of raptured
amazement in the lift of the tufted Bellwether
eyebrows. "Laddie," he murmured, "this is
wonderful. Imagine your studying in this hal
lowed spot!"
Since the great one had taken to wearing
rubber-soled shoes to classes, I never had been
able to detect his approach. I had not even an
inkling of his presence until the Bellwether fore
finger rendered an approving tap upon my
shoulder.
I looked around. The bench of the Inner
Quad was littered with bits of paper covered
with mystic figures in what I fondly term my
handwriting. The pencil in my fingers was
worn to a stub.
"Bellwether," I wondered, "what sort of guff
is this? Why all this eulogy in my behalf?"
"Simple," deduced the great one. "You've
been studying, of course. Probably for some
sort of math mid-term." The Bellwether smile
was condescending.
My answering grin was positively shameful.
"But, Bellwether," I chortled, "you're off on the
beam. I've been figuring out the scores on
these football cards! Think I'll make a bit of
coin this week-end."
The crestfallen gleam in the Bellwether eye
was swiftly changed to a glint of attrition. The
Bellwether forefinger lashed out beneath my
shrinking nose.
"Laddie," he cried, "have you fallen so low?"
"Low?" I was a bit off the beam. "You mean
in a sort of financial way? Well, I admit I am
a . . ."
Even the great man winced at that one. "Lad
die," he continued, taking a firmer grip on my
shoulder. "I was referring to the more intrinsic
aspects of the racket. Of course you knew that
you are aiding and abetting a lottery?"
"Well, you see, I, ah . . ."
"Oh, you didn't? Then probably you knew
it was all against the law?"
I peered beneath the surrounding shrubbery
for a policeman. "Bellwether, are you . .
"Yes, I'm sure. Besides, it's contrary to the
statutes of the University. You know those fel
lows distributing the cards haven't gotten clear
ance through the Administration. That makes
you an accessory to the fact. You knew that,
didn't you?"
I thought that one over. "Well, Emery . . ."
The sage continued. "Besides, you're putting
