DESPITE the fact that only about 1 per cent of
the student body participates in the actual
publication of The Daily, its other 99 per cent
may contribute at any time to these columns.
Through the medium of Campus Opinion it
is their privilege to point with pride and view
with alarm, to agitate, to criticize, to offer sug
gestions and attack motives. The campus has
done so, often and loudly.
And from the mail-bags full of correspond
once have sprung many important additions to
the Farm's physical and intellectual store.
Heally only one rule governs the use of this

daily space reserved for airing Stanford opin
ion.
Letters to Campus Opinion must be signed
by the writer. If, however, the author requests
that his name be deleted in publication, the edi
torial board will do so. A large number of let
ters are filed promptly in the waste basket be
cause they fail to meet this simple requirement.
To keep Campus Opinion a representative
matter, writeâ€”but sign your name.
