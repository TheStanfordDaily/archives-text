### BUD AMES 
Oil BOY! LOTS OF BLOOD!
JT'S an easy thing to pick up your newspaper in
the morning, glance through the crammed pages and
then—all of a sudden, bang, you read something you
don't like.
The fact that you don't like it can't be denied, any
more than you can deny a hotfoot. But it must be
realized that printing everything that everybody will
like at all times is as impossible as catching Pete
Kmetovic. It just can't be done, brother; it just can't
be done.
But newspapers all over the country try very hard
to do that impossible thing. They slip up in some in
stances. And then in other instances they make up
for their "sins." Just as an example, which we were
working up to all the time anyway, is the manner in
which the newspapers all over the country handle
news-reporting on major airplane crashes which, as
it must to all, come to even the best of planes.
«< * * *
J-JERE the newspapers really play ball.
It's a nasty thing to look forward to, but the
next time some airliner crashes, take a thorough look
into the printed reports. They will always place all
or almost all of the blame on the pilots or the weather
conditions, or an incorrect wrist watch—but there is
rarely anything blamed on the planes.
For this, the airplane industry and U. S. airlines
are extremely thankful. Flying is a growing field,
which you already know, and all it takes is a couple
of juicy crashes to knock off their passenger trade
for months to come.
Just like Jerry Mayer, Daily associate, who was
going to fly from Stanford back to a big journalism
conference in Kansas City. That flying would save
him valuable school time. Everything was all okey—
that is, until that airliner crashed just recently up in
Utah. Immediately Mayer's mother wrote him that
flying was "no-go," and that it was "the train or else."
Multiply that a few hundred times, and you get
some idea of what a crash will do to the air lines.
* * >i« #
A™ if the newspapers didn't play ball, and lay the
blame on the weather instead of the plane, you
could multiply that by THOUSANDS. And don't
think it doesn't take restraint to keep from printing
that airplane "was mechanically inferior," and that
"the blood was spread for blocks and blocks around."
That is the sort of material of which journalistic epics
are made.
So don't think that the papers are always just
jumping at a chance to print "tales of blood and
slaughter."
Believe it or not, they sometimes look deeper than
the surface.

which the newspapers all over the country handle
news-reporting on major airplane crashes which, as
it must to all, come to even the best of planes.

J-JERE the newspapers really play ball.
It's a nasty thing to look forward to, but the
next time some airliner crashes, take a thorough look
into the printed reports. They will always place all
or almost all of the blame on the pilots or the weather
conditions, or an incorrect wrist watch—but there is
rarely anything blamed on the planes.
For this, the airplane industry and U. S. airlines
are extremely thankful. Flying is a growing field,
which you already know, and all it takes is a couple
of juicy crashes to knock off their passenger trade
for months to come.
Just like Jerry Mayer, Daily associate, who was
going to fly from Stanford back to a big journalism
conference in Kansas City. That flying would save
him valuable school time. Everything was all okey—
that is, until that airliner crashed just recently up in
Utah. Immediately Mayer's mother wrote him that
flying was "no-go," and that it was "the train or else."
Multiply that a few hundred times, and you get
some idea of what a crash will do to the air lines.

A™ if the newspapers didn't play ball, and lay the
blame on the weather instead of the plane, you
could multiply that by THOUSANDS. And don't
think it doesn't take restraint to keep from printing
that airplane "was mechanically inferior," and that
"the blood was spread for blocks and blocks around."
That is the sort of material of which journalistic epics
are made.
So don't think that the papers are always just
jumping at a chance to print "tales of blood and
slaughter."
Believe it or not, they sometimes look deeper than
the surface.
Oil BOY! LOTS OF BLOOD!
JT'S an easy thing to pick up your newspaper in
the morning, glance through the crammed pages and
then—all of a sudden, bang, you read something you
don't like.
The fact that you don't like it can't be denied, any
more than you can deny a hotfoot. But it must be
realized that printing everything that everybody will
like at all times is as impossible as catching Pete
Kmetovic. It just can't be done, brother; it just can't
be done.
But newspapers all over the country try very hard
to do that impossible thing. They slip up in some in
stances. And then in other instances they make up
for their "sins." Just as an example, which we were
working up to all the time anyway, is the manner in
which the newspapers all over the country handle
news-reporting on major airplane crashes which, as
it must to all, come to even the best of planes.
