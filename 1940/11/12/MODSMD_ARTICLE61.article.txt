# CAMPUS OPINION
## GODS LAW VS. THE DAILY 
### 
EDITOR, SIR:
I should like to call attention to the fact that
The Stanford Daily is guilty of helping to promulgate
the insidious philosophy which is destroying the
foundations of civilization in other parts of the world
and which is attempting to undermine our own.
In the last editorial, signed G. M., this is stated in
summing up a British statesman's activities: "Neville
Chamberlain's station in history depends upon who in
the future will interpret the facts of this era." Per
haps in the history books, BUT NOT IN HISTORY.
Such sloppy thinking and lack of evaluation as
this is a terrible danger in America. We can know
the truth and in spite of whoever interprets or mis
interprets the facts in history books, Chamberlain's
acts were either right or wrong on an absolute basis
of God's law, according to whether he acted for the
good of the world or not and not according to who
interprets the facts.
So G. M., though the rest of your editorial is fair
and charitable, think over your philosophy and realize
that the true standard is not our mind or the writing
of any government but, the natural law. and it is in
relation to this that we must see anyone's place in
history ,and in relation to this that we must chart our
international course.

(Editor's Note: It is my opinion that you have
not disproved the contention established in the
editorial you refer to. Who. for instance, is going
to evaluate what constitutes the "absolute basis of
God's law." And two persons may not agree on
what determines "natural law."—G. M.)
