# AH. PHONES AGAIN
## 
### 
TPHE EDITOR, SIR:
The Encina phones are back in service.
Now that we have been without them for more
than a week and realize the inconvenience caused by
their disconnection, I think I express the feelings of a
majority of the Encina men when I say I sincerely
hope that whoever is responsible for this dastardly
incident will hereafter vent his maniacal fury some
where of! the campus and particularly not in Encina.
Though given a chance to witness the inconve
nience which he caused the 500 residents of Encina,
the perpetrator who would not 'fess up, must by
now feci as low as he is in the eyes of the entire
campus.
Sincerely,
Encinaman
