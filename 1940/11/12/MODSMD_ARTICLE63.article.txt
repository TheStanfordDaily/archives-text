THE EDITOR. SIR:
The latest B.A.C. Student Body Card Inquisi
tion seems to be under way. so it might be appropriate
to brine a few figures to the attention of that august
body, in re the transferability of said cards.
The average Stanford student doesn't seem to
realize it, but he pays $10 a quarter of his $15 for
"special student privileges." What arc these privi
leges? We are permitted to pay 52.35 more to attend
our football games than does the purchaser of a sea
son ticket! The latter pays $<> plus $4.40 for Big Game—
a total of $10.40; added to our ten bucks is the $2.75
for S.C. and Big Game a total of $12.75.
But this isn't enough. We are charged ten dollars
for each of the next two quarters for a couple of
dollars worth of basketball and baseball entertain
ment. And yet, we can't transfer our cards without
the risk of depositing an extra two dollars in the
B.A.C.'s coffers. It would seem that the student body
has become only a subsidiary to the 8.A.C.. to be
exploited at will.
Hopefully for the CI ass of 42 on,
