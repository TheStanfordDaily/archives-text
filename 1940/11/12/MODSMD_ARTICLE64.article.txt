# Fading Beauty Is Main Idea Of New Novel
## 
### 
•MR. SKEFFINGTON" by Eliza
beth. On sale at the Stanford
Bookstore.
This delightful story, by the author
of "Elizabeth and Her German
Garden" and "The Enchanted
April,"is not about Mr. Skeflington
at all. It is the exclusive story of
Mrs. Skeflington.
Fanny Skeflington is one of those
women who has always been beau
tiful, petted, and spoiled. Suddenly,
when she is nearly 50, she realizes
that a bout of typhoid has robbed
her of her beauty.
ANNOYING DOCTOR
When she seeks a famous doctor's
advice, he tells her bluntly to act
her age and look up her divorced
husband. Naturally she's horrified,
and instead she begins to look up
her old lovers.
One by one the men of her ilfe
parade through the pages—some old
and bald, some grown a shade of
fensive with the years, a few callow
and embarrassed. But not one of
them understands Fanny's quest.
SUPERB PORTRAITS
She isn't quite sure herself. Per
haps she's looking for peace, per
haps a reason for the years of un
thinking pleasure her beauty has
given her. Fanny is no fool, and she
has a charming sense of humor; the
men, squirming in the presence of
this no-longer-lovely ghost out of
the past, are ludicrous, pathetic, and
altogether human.
Elizabeth tells the stoiy in the in
cisive, lucid, graceful style that is
peculiarly her own. She gives no
quarter to the heroine's admittedly
glaring faults, but Fanny's still about
the most likeable and believable
character out of fiction we've met
lately.—Nowell
