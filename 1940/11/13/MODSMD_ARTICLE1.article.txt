HITLER and Soviet Pre
mier H. V. Molotov met for two j
and a half hours in Berlin yester- j
day and the ears of the world are \
waiting for some official indication j
of what the two men have decided. |
But one thing seems all but cer- j
tain.
Great Britain's position will not be j
improved as a result of a conver- j
sation between Hitler and Stalin's j
most trusted diplomat.
In Washington yesterday, high
diplomatic officials in the State De
partment offered what on the sur
face seems a likely outcome of the
conversations in Berlin. These
sources suggested that Germany's
primary objective at the present
time is control of Iraq's oil fields,
which lie to the east and south of
Turkey.
To attain this objective, Ger
many must secure the co-opera
lion of Russia to put enough pres
sure on Turkey to win her away
from her pact with Great Britain
and to force her into the Axis
camp.
Hitler, if this is to be the case,
must reach some agreement with
Russia over the Dardanelles and
Turkey. Washington observers put
forth the speculation that Germany
would also seek some agreement as
to spheres of influence in the Near
East. Germany might offer Russia a
free hand in Persia in return for
pressure on Turkey and a free hand
in Iraq.

possible purposes of Ger
man control of the oil fields in
Iraq were advanced:
First, to give Nazi war economy a
much-needed oil supply.
Second, to halt the flow of this
supply to the British and particu
larly to the British fleet in the Medi
terranean.
Third, to eliminate Turkey as a
potential threat to Axis domination
of the eastern Mediterranean.
If Hitler is able to persuade Molo
tov to put "the squeeze" on Turkey,
Germany may very well be in a po
sition to reach her objective in the
Near East.
Every indication is that in the
meeting. Hitler did not make any
demands that would antagonize a
most convenient friendship, and
vice versa that Molotov did not
attempt to stay Hitler's hand to
the extent of losing his friendship.
The question now is not whether
or not there is actual cordiality be
tween the two nations. The fact is
that the present status of ostensible
friendship is convenient more than
a little for both natiorsjßUKnd both
Germany and Russia are having
some trouble from other quarters;
Germany from Britain and Russia
from Japan.
If Molotov leaves Berlin in a huff
—without some new agreement—the
world will be as surprised as it was
following the original Nazi-Soviet
deal two summers ago. And yet, this
is a possibility.

interesting light was thrown on
the Italo-Greek war in the
mountainous region of the Hellenic
peninsula yesterday when Virginio
Gayda, authoratitive Fascist spokes
man in Rome, claimed that prepa
rations for the Greek campaign were
not started until after the fighting
commenced.
To American ears, this sounded
like a poor alibi for an even poorer
Italian military display in the Bal
kans.
Gayda went on to say that "the
British and Greek aggression" pro
voked the conflict and that the Ital
ians had not expected to be forced
1o wage war against Greece. Just
how Greece had antagonized Italy,
Gayda did not say.
In Athens the Germtfti legation
reaffirmed that Greek-German re
lations were satisfactory and that
Germany regards the war as en
tirely an Italian affair. This was per
haps the greatest encouragement
Greece has had since the start of the
conflict, for Greece could not with
stand a German blitzkrief from the
north.
