# Molotov, Fuehrer Confer On New World Set-up In Secret Berlin Meeting
## Two-day Talks Believed to Concern Mutual Balkan Problems, Diplomatic Relations with Vichy Government 
### 
BERLIN, Nov. 12 (UP). —Yiacheslav M. IMolotov, Soviet Premier and
Foreign Commissar, conferred for two and a half hours today with Chan
cellor Adolf Hitler on his plans for a "new order" in world affairs.
Molotov, who arrived by train at 11 a.m., was not accorded the usual
Nazi pageantry—possibly due to wartime restrictions.
An hour after the Soviet statesman had been installed in Bcllevuc
Palace, he was received by Foreign Minister Joachim von Rihhentrop,

who had welcomed him at the sta
tion with other Nazi dignitaries, for
the first of a series of political and
economic conferences expected to
extend through two days.
CONFERENCE SECRET
A company of storm trooper body
guards presented honors on hir. ar
rival and departure.
What transpired at Molotov's con
ferences was kept secret. Neither
official German quarters nor the
German press would make any dis
closure or hazard any opinion on
the talks.
According to some quarters, the
talks today as well as those to he
held tomorrow deal primarily with
delineating clearly the spheres of
influence and interest of Germany,
Italy, Russia, Japan and perhaps
Spain. Although the German-Ital
ian-Japancsc alliance established
the sphere of each of these nations
in broad outlines, German quar
ters state all the parties concerned
thought it advisable to formulate
their relations more precisely.
The questions discussed therefore
cover not only Europe but Asia and
Africa. Their nature was said to
be dominantly political.
These quarters expect the ques
tion of the Near East, specifically
Turkey's present-day position, to
occupy an important place in the
discussions.
BALKANS DISCUSSED
It was felt the new situation in
the Balkans arising from the Italo-
Greek war also would receive close
consideration. Although Italy is not
represented at the conference, it
was believed she would be kept in
formed of the procedings.
German quarters expressed opti
mism at the outcome of the German-
Russian conversations and said they
will result in definite formulation of
each country's future policy.
MORE TALKS EXPECTED
German quarters expect the re
sults of the conferences to be ap
parent soon. For one thing, fur
ther diplomatic contacts between
Berlin, Vichy and Madrid were ex
pected to follow immediately. In
creased diplomatic activity between
the Axis powers and several South
eastern states —especially Hungary,
Rumania and Slovakia and prob
ably Bulgaria later—also was ex
pected to follow the present talks.
The Russian statesman is accom
panied by a staff of 32 advisers and
experts in foreign and economic
j affairs. This is the first state visit
| abroad of a head of the U.S.S.R.
