# Stanford to Play Major Role In Defense Training Program
## 
### 
Under a $!),000.000 nationwide appropriation by Congress, a program
to train engineers of northern California. Nevada .and L'tali for skilled
technical posts in national defense industries has been launched.
Flans for gearing Stanford into the national ellort have been outlined
by Samuel B. Morris, dean of engineering at Stanford, and regional

adviser to the Federal Office of
cation, sponsor of the program, to
the engineering school faculty.
COURSES OFFERED
Announcement of the first courses i
to be offered will be made on Nov.
25, and instruction is expected to
begin shortly thereafter.
Thirty thousand students are ex
pected to enroll throughout the
country at about 150 engineering
schools eligible to participate.
FEDERAL GRANTS
Federal allotments will be made to
those colleges participating in the
program to meet the costs of sala
ries ,materials and supplies, refer
ence books, and maintenance and
repair of equipment. Living ex
penses of students will not be de
frayed. but students will not be re
quired' to pay tuition.
Courses given will be for those
able to devote their entire time to
preparation for future defense jobs,
and for workers now employed who
wish to enter into more technical
fields.
TO FILL SHORTAGE
Courses given will be designed to
I fill in the potential shortages of in
i spectors of materials, chemicals, ex
plosives, tools, dies, aircraft power
plants, structures and instruments;
production engineers and super
, visors; physical metallurgists; ma
i line engineers and architects.
The Stanford Engineering School
has sent questionnaires to 3.000 of
| its graduates, all of whom are em
j ployed, asking what defense train
ing course would be of most prac
! tical interest to them. A majority of
the reports received indicate that
' the greatest interest is in production
i engineering.
