### 
Predictions of an early and cold
winter and an exceptional season
for skiers is being borne out by the
weather, according to the Winter
Sports Committee of the California
| State Chamber of Commerce.
Last Sunday skiing was enjoyed
j by groups in Lassen Volcanic Na
tional Park, at Mt. Rose in Nevada,
I at Soda Springs in the Donner Sum
; mit area, and at Mammoth Moun
j tain on the Eastern Sierra Slopes.
At the latter point, three feet of
packed snow was reported, with ice
I forming on the lakes and predic
; tions that it would hold were unani-
I mous.
