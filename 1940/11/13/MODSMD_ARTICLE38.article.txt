# Gridders Mold Defense Early for O.S.C. Battle
## Powerful Beaver Reserves Hope To End Stanford Victory String 
### 
Evidently the Stanford coaching staff has an extra healthy respect for
their next Saturday opponent's offense. For yesterday, a day earlier than
has been the usual procedure, Coach Clark Shaughnessy and his gang of
assistants started molding the defense with which they plan to stoji
Oregon State's Beavers. A _____

During the weeks of practice be
fore the Washington, Santa Clara,
and U.S.C. games the Cardinals did
not go to work planning to stop the
heralded offensive power of their
three toughest rivals to date until
Wednesday. But yesterday Shaugh
nessy had some willing freshmen
who haven't had enough football
this year despite the fact that their
regular season is over, working some
of the Beaver plays against the var
sity.
BEAVERS IMPROVED**^
According to Assistant Coach Phil
Bengtson, who first saw the Beav
ers in action early in the season in
their 0-0 tie with the Trojans, and
more recently in their 19-13 victory
over California, Oregon State is a
greatly improved team.
The northerners' coach, Lon Stin
er. has developed a powerful second
string which might mean the differ
ence between the two teams next
Saturday. The Cardinals, wearied
by seven straight weeks of hard
fought, winning football, might be
able to stand up against the assault
of one Oregon team but the weight
of numbers the Beavers posses might
be too tough for them.
ATTACK ANALYZED
Oregon State has a potent pass
ing attack which raised havoc with
California a couple of weeks ago in
Berkeley. Three times the Beavers
scored by air and twice the combi
nation was from halfback Bob
Dethem to halfback Gene Gray.
With hard-socking George Peters
to lay down the blocks and with the
highly touted Jim Kisselbergh to
provide the ball carrying punch,
Stiner's team has a good power of
fense. For speedy end sweeps, Ore
gon State has their two fleet half
backs to pack the mail, and on such
occasions Kisselbergh lends a ca
pable hand with his blocking.
TOUGHER AND TOUGHER
Every week things appear tougher
for the Indians, but that is the way
for all winning teams. Each victory
they chalk up takes a little more
physically out of the boys and cer
tainly Stanford's ball games have
been getting progressively tougher.
And with every victory Shaugh
nessy's Warriors hang up, their fu
ture opponents become more deter
mined to beat them. So now that
Stanford is at the top of the heap,
with everyone pointing for them,
each Saturday, regardless of the op
position, becomes a higher hurdle
for the Indians.

An 1877 football team had nine
linemen, a quarterback, two half
backs, a three-quarter back, and
two fullbacks.

ence between the two teams next
Saturday. The Cardinals, wearied
by seven straight weeks of hard
fought, winning football, might be
able to stand up against the assault
of one Oregon team but the weight
of numbers the Beavers posses might
be too tough for them.
ATTACK ANALYZED
Oregon State has a potent pass
ing attack which raised havoc with
California a couple of weeks ago in
Berkeley. Three times the Beavers
scored by air and twice the combi
nation was from halfback Bob
Dethem to halfback Gene Gray.
With hard-socking George Peters
to lay down the blocks and with the
highly touted Jim Kisselbergh to
provide the ball carrying punch,
Stiner's team has a good power of
fense. For speedy end sweeps, Ore
gon State has their two fleet half
backs to pack the mail, and on such
occasions Kisselbergh lends a ca
pable hand with his blocking.
TOUGHER AND TOUGHER
Every week things appear tougher
for the Indians, but that is the way
for all winning teams. Each victory
they chalk up takes a little more
physically out of the boys and cer
tainly Stanford's ball games have
been getting progressively tougher.
And with every victory Shaugh
nessy's Warriors hang up, their fu
ture opponents become more deter
mined to beat them. So now that
Stanford is at the top of the heap,
with everyone pointing for them,
each Saturday, regardless of the op
position, becomes a higher hurdle
for the Indians.

An 1877 football team had nine
linemen, a quarterback, two half
backs, a three-quarter back, and
two fullbacks.
Evidently the Stanford coaching staff has an extra healthy respect for
their next Saturday opponent's offense. For yesterday, a day earlier than
has been the usual procedure, Coach Clark Shaughnessy and his gang of
assistants started molding the defense with which they plan to stoji
Oregon State's Beavers. A _____

During the weeks of practice be
fore the Washington, Santa Clara,
and U.S.C. games the Cardinals did
not go to work planning to stop the
heralded offensive power of their
three toughest rivals to date until
Wednesday. But yesterday Shaugh
nessy had some willing freshmen
who haven't had enough football
this year despite the fact that their
regular season is over, working some
of the Beaver plays against the var
sity.
BEAVERS IMPROVED**^
According to Assistant Coach Phil
Bengtson, who first saw the Beav
ers in action early in the season in
their 0-0 tie with the Trojans, and
more recently in their 19-13 victory
over California, Oregon State is a
greatly improved team.
The northerners' coach, Lon Stin
er. has developed a powerful second
string which might mean the differ
ence between the two teams next
Saturday. The Cardinals, wearied
by seven straight weeks of hard
fought, winning football, might be
able to stand up against the assault
of one Oregon team but the weight
of numbers the Beavers posses might
