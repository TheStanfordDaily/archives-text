# Marble Finishes Amateur Career
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 12 (UP).—Al
ice Marble turned professional to
day and thereby accomplished in
less than four minutes the task
which the world's best women ama
teurs have failed to do for four
years—end her reign as queen of
American tennis.
The blonde Oakland, California,
miss, probably the best woman play
er of all time, announced her de
cision briefly and simply. Any fur
ther tennis conquests, she said,
would be superfluous and the time
has come to concentrate on a per
manent career. The career will be
that of a concert singer.
