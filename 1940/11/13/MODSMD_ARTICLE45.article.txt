## 
### 
The Stanford varsity boxing squad
held an informal workout against
the San Jose State varsity squad
yesterday and showed up very well
in the ten non-decision matches
that were fought. '"Prospects are
fine for a good season for the Stan
ford mittmen," stated Coach Clay
ton Frye after watching his boxers
work out against the San Jose slug
gers.

There are 50,000 to 7,000 workers
in the average beehive.
