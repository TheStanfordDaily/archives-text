CORVALLIS, Ore., Nov. 12 (UP).
—The Oregon State College foot
ball team drilled to day against
Stanford plays outlined to them by
scouts in preparation for their clash
with the Indians Saturday. The
Orangemen's defense has yielded
an average of only one touchdown a
game this season and their offense
showed increased power in a tri

CLEVELAND, Nov. 12 (UP).—
Roger Thorpe Peckinpaugh, a gray,
quiet man, brought a new air of
soft-spoken confidence to Cleveland
today in replacing roaring volatile
Oscar Vitt as manager of the In
dians' baseball team.
Quietly, almost perfunctorily, club
owner Alva Bradle announced
Peckinpaugh was his choice after
weeks of speculation .and rumors.
Thus returned to Cleveland one of
the greatest shortstops in baseball—
the man fired by Bradley in 1933
after managing the team for five
years.
Bradley disclosed Peckinpaugh
had been signed to a two-year
contract but would not divulge the
terms.
