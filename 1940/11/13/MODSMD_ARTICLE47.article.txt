# Frosh Hoopsters Prime for Marin
## 
### 
Though football still tops the
sports parade, Stanford's freshman
hoop squad is gunning for its opener
with Marin J. C. Dec. 2 in the Pa
vilion. Practice has been under way
only two weeks, and the boys are
slowly rounding into shape.
Thirty-four answered the call,
but last week's cut sliced the squad
to 23. Larry Wolf, Bill Nourse. Bud
Madden, and Hank Hege, reported
from football, giving Lee 27 to
work with.
Most important game on the sched
ule is a three-game series with Cal
at the end of the season. Lee's
teams in the past two years have
defeated the Bears, and though it is
lar too early to make any predic
tions, the strength of star high
school and prep school players
should give the Papooses a power
ful team.

BERKELEY, Cal., Nov. 12 (UP).â€”
Still elated by California's triumph
over U.S.C., Coach Stub Allison pre
dicted his Bears may play their
best game of the season against Ore
gon next Saturday.
