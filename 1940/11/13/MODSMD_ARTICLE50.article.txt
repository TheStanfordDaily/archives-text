# Lowering the Boom
## 
### 
THE latest addition to the A.S.S.U.'s "depart
ment of worthy projects" is the full-fledged
Card Files system that emerged from last night's
Excom meeting.
Betty Avery and Jim Mack said, "Here it is,
in working order."
And Ex Committee promptly passed a motion
that will lower the boom on all activities chair
men. Beginning at the first of winter quarter,
all committee appointments for general student
body projects must bear the approving signa
tures of the men's and women's Card File chief
tains.
If these two chairmen are vigilant and if, too,
committee heads are co-operative, Stanford's
student democracy can extend to every phase
of the activity system. Last night's swift legis
lative action was the result of several years of
planning, the result of trial-and-error experi
mentation.
The one truly important "if" which governs
the success of the Card File plan is the doubt
which surrounds its acceptance by chairmen
who, heretofore, have had a free hand in nam
ing their committee workers. While these lead
ers were usually thoughtful in their choice of
members, they sometimes stooped to sheer poli
tics. More often they were somewhat careless —
they often named close friends or club or fra
ternity brothers who might benefit from a free
bid tossed their way or a few words of publicity
in a news column. '
Under the Card File system formulated this
year, committee heads will still be free to pick
and choose workers as they please. But, from
the ratings on the cards of their nominees, it
must be apparent to those in charge of the file
that the index has been used, that selections
are sound and in good faith.
Ratings of workers will be made by chairmen
v/ho have witnessed their efforts. When it is
clearly established that no appointments will
be made outside the Card File, student regis
tration will climb. Already it totals nearly 100
per cent among the women, more than 50 per
cent among men.
Such a scheme as this is necessarily ideal
istic. Its critics can find a few loop-holes that
will make it possible for chairmen to avoid em
ploying the files. Excom and its Card File work
ers lay no claim to the invulnerability of the
plan.
But it can work. Twice this quarter, on large
assignments, it has proved practicable.
And if it cancels a campus "spoils system"
and substitutes a heightened student democracy
in even the most unimportant committee task,
its success will be secure.

THE latest addition to the A.S.S.U.'s "depart
ment of worthy projects" is the full-fledged
Card Files system that emerged from last night's
Excom meeting.
Betty Avery and Jim Mack said, "Here it is,
in working order."
And Ex Committee promptly passed a motion
that will lower the boom on all activities chair
men. Beginning at the first of winter quarter,
all committee appointments for general student
body projects must bear the approving signa
tures of the men's and women's Card File chief
tains.
If these two chairmen are vigilant and if, too,
committee heads are co-operative, Stanford's
student democracy can extend to every phase
of the activity system. Last night's swift legis
lative action was the result of several years of
planning, the result of trial-and-error experi
mentation.
The one truly important "if" which governs
the success of the Card File plan is the doubt
which surrounds its acceptance by chairmen
who, heretofore, have had a free hand in nam
ing their committee workers. While these lead
ers were usually thoughtful in their choice of
members, they sometimes stooped to sheer poli
tics. More often they were somewhat careless —
they often named close friends or club or fra
ternity brothers who might benefit from a free
bid tossed their way or a few words of publicity
in a news column. '
Under the Card File system formulated this
year, committee heads will still be free to pick
and choose workers as they please. But, from
the ratings on the cards of their nominees, it
must be apparent to those in charge of the file
that the index has been used, that selections
are sound and in good faith.
Ratings of workers will be made by chairmen
v/ho have witnessed their efforts. When it is
clearly established that no appointments will
be made outside the Card File, student regis
tration will climb. Already it totals nearly 100
per cent among the women, more than 50 per
cent among men.
Such a scheme as this is necessarily ideal
istic. Its critics can find a few loop-holes that
will make it possible for chairmen to avoid em
ploying the files. Excom and its Card File work
ers lay no claim to the invulnerability of the
plan.
But it can work. Twice this quarter, on large
assignments, it has proved practicable.
And if it cancels a campus "spoils system"
and substitutes a heightened student democracy
in even the most unimportant committee task,
its success will be secure.
