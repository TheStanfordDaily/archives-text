A LITTLE more than a year ago a Farm senior
sat on the prickly cushion in this same
swivel chair on which I am now sitting, slipped
a sheaf of copy paper from the battered desk to
my left, and typed out a dream of a Big Game
Dance in which the community of Stanford
could share.
Larry Livingston, then Editor of The Daily,
continued his fight for a Big Game Dance for
Stanford and by Stanford. The Daily carried
both story and feature comment upon the pro
posal. Larry poured several reams of editorials
into the back pages, gradually formulating a
workable and a desirable plan for the proposed
occasion.
The idea caught on. Campus Opinion letters
and English Corner crowds liked the proposal.
Ex-corn discussed it, found it feasible, and hired
big-name Jimmy Grier and his orchestra at the
eleventh hour.
Millbrae Country Club was packed, and the
dance turned out to be a howling success.
At one jump the Big Game Dance arrived as
a campus tradition.
This year, with Cardinals again handling the
administrative details of the function, Big Game
Dance is already well under way. And in line
with the avowed purpose of making it as rep
resentative a Stanford affair as possible, two
major changes from last year's policy have
been made.
First, the location has been changed to big
ger San Francisco Country Club, which has
facilities to handle a larger crowd than did last
year's spot. The move was wise; last year they
turned them away at the door.
Second, the price per couple has been

dropped to three bucks, a tariff that will ac
commodate end-of-the-quarter pocketbooks. At
last year's price a profit was realized by the
A.S.S.U., sponsors of the affair. This year's
policy is one of making the dance self-support
ing—not of realizing an income.
Another typically Stanford touch was added
to the list of pre-dance plans when Freddy Na
gel, Farm alumnus of a few years back, was
signed to play for the dance. A few electricians
and movers may turn out to be the only non-
Stanford men in the country club.
It is a Stanford affair. It is something that
Stanford can arrange for her Roughs and Far
merettes. And it is something that is fun.
It's a swell tradition.—W. C.

swivel chair on which I am now sitting, slipped
a sheaf of copy paper from the battered desk to
my left, and typed out a dream of a Big Game
Dance in which the community of Stanford
could share.
Larry Livingston, then Editor of The Daily,
continued his fight for a Big Game Dance for
Stanford and by Stanford. The Daily carried
both story and feature comment upon the pro
posal. Larry poured several reams of editorials
into the back pages, gradually formulating a
workable and a desirable plan for the proposed
occasion.
The idea caught on. Campus Opinion letters
and English Corner crowds liked the proposal.
Ex-corn discussed it, found it feasible, and hired
big-name Jimmy Grier and his orchestra at the
eleventh hour.
Millbrae Country Club was packed, and the
dance turned out to be a howling success.
At one jump the Big Game Dance arrived as
a campus tradition.
This year, with Cardinals again handling the
administrative details of the function, Big Game
Dance is already well under way. And in line
with the avowed purpose of making it as rep
resentative a Stanford affair as possible, two
major changes from last year's policy have
been made.
First, the location has been changed to big
ger San Francisco Country Club, which has
facilities to handle a larger crowd than did last
year's spot. The move was wise; last year they
turned them away at the door.
Second, the price per couple has been

dropped to three bucks, a tariff that will ac
commodate end-of-the-quarter pocketbooks. At
last year's price a profit was realized by the
A.S.S.U., sponsors of the affair. This year's
policy is one of making the dance self-support
ing—not of realizing an income.
Another typically Stanford touch was added
to the list of pre-dance plans when Freddy Na
gel, Farm alumnus of a few years back, was
signed to play for the dance. A few electricians
and movers may turn out to be the only non-
Stanford men in the country club.
It is a Stanford affair. It is something that
Stanford can arrange for her Roughs and Far
merettes. And it is something that is fun.
It's a swell tradition.—W. C.
