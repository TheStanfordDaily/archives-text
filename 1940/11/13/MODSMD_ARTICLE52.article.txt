### BUD AMES 
. . . FOR "SPECIAL STUDENT PRIVILEGES"
this ticket-checking monkey business that went
on at the Washington game last Saturday has
stirred up no small amount of vitriolic comment on
the part of most of the students. This grumble germ
has even spread to part of the faculty.
It might prove worth your while to refer back to
yesterday's Campus Opinion letter which complained
against the checking of student body cards. But for
the sake of convenient summing-up, the letter pointed
out that each student pays 10 buckaroos a quarter for
what are termed "special student privileges."
That's what those punch-numbers on your student
body card represent—"special student privileges." But,
the letter points out, we are "permitted to pay $2.35
more to attend our football games than does" the plain
old John Doe purchaser of a season ticket.
And what do you get for your $10 during winter
and spring quarter? Why, you get a few nifty basket
ball games, and a couple of baseball games, if you
like baseball, and, and, and—well, just and.

as was suggested earlier in the col
umn, the students aren't the only ones who feel
a little hurt.
Yesterday an assistant teacher on the Farm faculty
dropped a piece of sage, and slightly heated, comment
on this student body card deal.
"I'm an assistant on the faculty," he said, "and I
don't even get the same rate on football tickets as do
the Stanford Dames, the wives of the faculty. I've got
to pay the regular outside price."
He then went on to wonder why some sort of con
cession couldn't be made for these assistants.

A ND all in all, most of the students were a little
hurt, by the whole affair. They just couldn't un
derstand why, after four or more years, the B.A.C.
should up and decide to check the cards at a home
game.
A great many didn't see the kick-off because they
were detained at the gate.
But what really caused the water to boil was the
trouble that gate attendants gave the rightful owners
of some of the cards.
One Tri-Delt stepped innocently to the gate and
presented her ticket. The gateman growled, "Are you
the person on this cai'd?"
"Yes, and my Bawlout average is 94 plus 102. And
[ live at the Tri-Delt house, whose president is So
and-So."
"Oh, 'memorizing it, eh? We'll have to hold you
here to check on this."
Finally, however, along came Pat Adams, whom
the gate attendant knew, and she vouched for her
sister.

Another sorority woman, swearing she hadn't given
away her student body card, was forced to walk all
the way back to the row to look for that card by a
gateman with whom she has been out on several dates.
She finally had to buy a regular ticket when she
couldn't find it.
Well, there's nothing like being trusted.
