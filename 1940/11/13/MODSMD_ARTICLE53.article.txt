## SOMEBODY MISSED THE BOAT 
### 
'pIE EDITOR. SIR:
As the editor of a student publication, your job
is, I presume, to keep the students informed on matters
concerning them. If so, you really missed the boat in
regard to the publicity for the sale of football tickets
this fall.
We new students were not acquainted with the
system of early sale of rooter's tickets here at Stan
ford, and the only notices we had about them were a
small item in The Daily on Sept. 30, and another one
at the bottom of page one, two days later, entitled,
"Cal, S.C. Ticket Sale Ends Today." These appeared
only one week after school opened, and two whole
months before the Big Game, and that's all the in
formation you gave us.
Today I had to buy a ticket for $4.40. The price is
plenty irritating, but so is the fact that my seat is on
(he two-yard line, a helluva spot, instead of in the
rooters section in midfield. I'm not alone, either. At
the B.A.C. there is a waiting list of about .'5OO students
who want seats in the rooting section. Thfit. wouldn't
be a bad addition to the size of the section, would it?
We have to pay The Daily two bucks a quarter
whether we like it or not, so how about giving us poor
students who don't know the score a little more dope
on matters like this? The Rose Bowl tickets will
uive you a good chance to practice up with some hig
her and blacker notices.
Sincerely yours,
Marion B. Scavers, Clr.B.
P.S.: You don't know anyone who has an extra
Big Game rooter's ticket, do you?
