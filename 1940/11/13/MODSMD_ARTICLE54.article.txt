"THE EDITOR, SIR:
When I came to Stanford and more particularly
to Encina, I thought that there was a really sweil
bunch of fellows here. And even though I still main
tain that belief as far as the fellows I know goes, there
evidently are the well known bad apples among them
as evidenced by the ones who damaged the tele
phones, the ones who turned in the fire alarms, and
the fellow who pushed in my rear fender and left me
to pay the bill.
It seems to me there is a point where fun leaves off
and where intentional, downright dirtiness begins.
The latter applies to the fellows who did the things
I mentioned above. We have a name for that kind
of guys as I believe anyone does. But it wouldn't
be fit to print.
Perhaps the ones who did damage to the phones
weren't Encina fellows as I have heard via the
Grapevine from one of the upperclass halls. I'm in
clined to believe this supposition, as it doesn't seem
logical that anyone here would do something that
would inconvenience him as much as the rest of the
Encina men. As for my car I'd like to say, it would bo
a real pleasure to get hold of that guy for just a few
minutes.
Sincerely yours,
One of the Class ul II
