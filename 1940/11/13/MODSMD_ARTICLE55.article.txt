# Fast Talking Lee Tracy Scores In Zany Comedy
## 
### 
"EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF," currently at the Geary Theater in
San Francisco.
j As WaUy Britt, a screen writer out of a job, fast-talking Lee Tracy
peonies hack to the stage in a role that wouldn't suffer in comparison

with his earlier Broadway successes.
The man who created the role of i
Hildy Johnson in "The Front Page," j
great newspaper play, and who j
played the lead in a London version
of "Idiot's Delight," is at his best in
the comedy vehicle written for him I
by Milton Lazarus and produced by !
Arthur Hutchinson and Arthur Rip
ley.
HOLLYWOOD CAST
As a play, "Every Man for Him
self" is nothing but what it pro- j
fesses to be, a comedy. But snappy
dialogue, a cbmpletely wacky plot, !
and a capable supporting east |
largely recruited from Hollywood I
to enhance the talents of Mr. Tracy j
put it a notch above the usual run '
of stage comedies.
The star's personality registers 1
much better over the footlights than j
it does on the screen. His motion ■
picture performances have never!
reached the standard he set in New
York as the hoofer in "Broadway," j
which ran for two years on the
G.W.W.
HUMOR UNINHIBITED
Also, Tracy has a much better op- i
portunity to put over his particular j
brand of satirical humor with no !
Hays office on hand to protect the |
morals of the audience.
As for the play itself, the first act ;
sets a pace in laughs and action that
the other two acts do not quite
maintain. The curtain rises on
Wally Britt asleep in a living room
chair, one shoe and sock on the j
floor.
FLASHBACK ON BINGE
From Al. Britt's general bandy
man, played by Murray Alper, the j
audience learns that the writer has
just returned from a four-day
binge that terminated a five-year \
dry spell.
During the remainder of the play
Britt and the audience learn how
he occupied his time during that
alcoholic period. A screwball ,
couple, Charlie Williams and Beryl :
Vaughan, a movie executive, played
by Hollywood's John Gallaudet, a
screen gangster, Grant Richards, and
a retired gang king, Wally Maher. j
and stooge, help complicate mat
ters.
LOVE INCLUDED
Wally Britt's love life is ade- |
quately taken care of by Susan Fox,
as Helen, and Kay Linaker, as j
Elizabeth. Miss Linaker appeared
the better actress of the two; so, j
evidently to make everyone happy, !
Miss Fox plays the feminine lead.
The show is booked to open on
Broadway in January. How it will
fare before the critical New Yorkers
no man can say, but right now it's a
better comedy than you'll see on the
screen.—Brucker
