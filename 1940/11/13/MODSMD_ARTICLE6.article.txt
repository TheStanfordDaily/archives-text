# Number 5868 Turns Up First For Army Health Examination
## 
### CHARLES BULL 
The draft is starting to work.
Dr. Charles E. Shepard. director of the Men Students' Health Service,
performed Sunday the first medical examinations which will either qual
ify or disqualify draft-eligible men from the local area.
But strangely enough the first man to be examined was not one who

was immdiately to be rushed off to,
the training camps, but whose order
number was way down the list,
5868.
GROVER FIRST IN LINE
He was Stanford's man of magic
and jiu jitsu, Jack Grover. Jack
wasn't worried about being drafted
right away but he's planning an ex
tended trip to South America for
purposes of study and adventure and
the draft board is not letting any
eligible man out of the country
without having his complete record
on file.
Any man who procures his pass
port to leave the United States by
special permission is subject wher
ever he is to call by the draft.
SOUTH AMERICAN WAY
Grover, who graduated last June,
will leave in January from New
York to register at the University
of Chile at Santiago, where he plans
to get his Master's degree on busi
ness opportunities in South Amer
ica, .
But all will not be study. For he
has chosen a subject which will
necessitate a good bit of travel
throughout the entire continent.
During these travels, in addition to
his survey work, he plans to fill in
spare time with deep-sea diving,
hunting, mountain climbing, and
photography, opportunities for all of
which are profuse in the southern
countries.
Grover might also do some teach
ing of self-defense, an art on which
he has specialized while at Stan
ford.
QUOTA- EXCEEDED
Dr. Shepard, who has been ap
pointed examiner for the whole Pale
Alto area, stated yesterday that the
selective service examination is al
most as thorough as the regulai
army physical.
Heartening to local men was Dr
Shepard's statement that the quots
for the Palo Alto area unil the first
j of the year was six men and thai
' there were already 18 volunteers.
YVASSERMAN N REQUIRED
"One thing being required of all
draftees this year that was not done
| during the 1917 draft is a Wasser
mann test," he said.
The Farm's genial health service
director volunteered to attempt ar
i answer to any and all questions or
physical requirements for prospec
tive draftees, saying, "There art
| many rumors floating around anc
we would be glad to try to straighter
them out if we could. Just tell then
! to come up."
