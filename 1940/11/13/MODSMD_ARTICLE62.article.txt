WASHINGTON, Nov. 12 (UP).â€”
The United States today formally
recognized Gen. Manuel Avila Ca
mancho as the President-elect of
Mexico. The move ended, insofar as
! this country is concerned, a dispute
between Avila Camancho and his
rival, Gen. Juan Andreu Almazan,
as to who was the President-elect.
Avila Camancho received formal
recognition when the State Depart
ment announced President Roosevelt
had named Vice-President-elect
Henry A. Wallace as his special
representative with rank of ambas
sador to attend the inauguration of
Camancho on Dec. 1.
It marked the first time the United
State has taken a formal and official
position in the Camancho-Almazan
controversy. Almazan, who has
I been in this country for several
weks, has persistently declared that
\ he would be inaugurated.
