AS the war in Europe drags on i
day after day, a victory for i
Great Britain seems more remote.
It is this thought that drives many
Americans into a most perplexing
position.
Americans, who cannot visualize |
a British defeat and at the same i
time are reluctant to commit !
themselves to a more definite par- j
ticipation in the war, are being
pulled by the desire for peace and
by the desire for the retention of
our democratic way, which they j
believe cannot stand in the face I
of a totalitarian victory in Europe.
Great Britain has maintained her
control of the seas although her
lifelines extending out from the Isles
are continually threatened. She may
lose control of the Mediterranean,
but it is doubtful whether this
would bring about a downfall at
home.
Germany, on the other hand, is
consolidating with some degree of
success—in spite of frequent reports
of dissension in conquered territo
ries—the en it re European continent.
Germany and her satellites are be
coming a more securely self-suffi
cient economic bloc as trade with
Soviet Russia expands.

most important
deficiency — oil — becomes more
accessible as she pushes further into
the Balkans. Importation from Rus
sia increases and production in Ru
mania cannot be counted upon—fol
lowing repair of crippled production
facilities which resulted from the
earthquake—to be heightened to sat
isfy Germany's war economy.
Food supplies on the continent are
barely adequate this winter, ac
cording to the most reliable reports
available in this country. But by
next spring some steps will have
been taken to increase agricultural
acreage in conquered or dominated
Balkan lands and distribution will
be improved.
In other words, the war in Europe
appears to be reaching some sort of
balance, which if untouched by
weight of new aid from nations in
other hemispheres, will continue in
definitely.
But the United States has un
dertaken a policy of additional aid
to Britain. From reports from
London and New York. U.S. aid
has already bolstered Britain's de
fenses considerably and even
contributed to her new aerial of
fenses.
Hitler spoke to Molotov in Ber
lin yesterday with this firmly in
mind. He was aware that U. S. help
to Britain was being stepped up to
the point where it was beginning to
be felt.
Hitler has given up his plan for
invasion of England, at least for
several months, it appears. His new
policy evidently is to maintain an
intensified submarine war on Brit
ish shipping and also to make the
European continent an economic unit
which can hold up regardless of the
British blockade.
R UT Hitler must take one more
step to make his position se
cure; he must have oil.
Observers in this country have
suggested for some months that
Hitler's next move would be toward
the Near Eastern oil fields in Iraq.
At present only Russia stands in the
way of this objective—for Turkey
must submit or be crushed without
support from the Soviet.—and the
talks in Berlin by now have prob
ably removed this last obstacle.
Reports from Athens and Lon
don were encouraging last night,
hut even these signs of Allied suc
cesses did not improve the long
range picture. In spite of the fact
that the Greeks arc more than
holding their own, their position
has not changed substantially
since the outbreak of the conflict
—and they remain doomed, sooner
or later, to Axis conquest'.
Germany has solidified her posi
tion; and her defeat seems more and
more remote. But Britain's position
requires our continued and increas
ing aid if she is to hold out.
The limit of this aid is the per
plexing problem that faces the gov
ernment in Washington as the war
drags on.
