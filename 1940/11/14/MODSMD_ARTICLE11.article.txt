BERKELEY. Nov. K'J (UP). —The telephone jangles incessantly to
night at a certain girls' boarding house near the University of Cali
fornia campus, because 20 of the resident co-eds had a letter pub
lished in The Daily California!!, student newspaper, offering them
selves, in a spirit of tomfoolery, as wives to prospective conscriptees.

It started in a spirit of tomfool
ery—but things are getting more
serious now. The girls put a tele
phone number in the letter. Since
The Daily Californian was published
this morning, nearly 50 young men
have called to ask for blind dates.
Under a. heading "Excellent Bar
gain," the student newspaper ran
the letter:
WE WILL MARRY'
"To the Editor: Only 20 more days
till enlistment—marry early and
avoid the draft. Our bureau can
guarantee to supply you with de
pendents who can cook, wash dishes,
tell jokes, dance, and like beer.
"Excellent bargain in blondes,
brunettes, and redheads. Only a
limited supply of non-smokers, sn
don't delay. Phone our Berkeley
representative now, BE (tele
phone number omitted here to keep
the number of applicants within
reasonable bounds—Ed.) and ask
for S. Claus, our personal repre
sentative, before Uncle Sam puts you
on a bean diet.
"This is an unpaid, non-political
adv.

SH, IT'S A (iAC,
"P.S.: That's not all we can do."
A call to BE brought a pleas
ant voiced girl who admitted she
was "S. Claus." In fact, she said,
she was the girl who wrote the let
ter, with the aid of 19 of her board
ing house friends.
"It's a gag," she said, "but I guess
some other people don't think so.
We've had more than 30 telephone
calls since the letter appeared.
"Of course, many of the girls
here want husbands, but they'll get
them the normal way. We didn't
really mean we'd many just anyone
who telephoned us. I'm sorry now
we included the telephone number.
"Most of the young men who call
ask for blind dates. So far there
I haven't been any direct proposals of
marriage. The girls here don't gen-
S orally accept blind dates from pcr
| feet, strangers," she added.
LINE BUSY
The "P. 5.," she said, wasn't the
: girls' idea.
"We didn't, put that post script on
the letter. We're pretty mad about
that. We think that, was tacked onto
, the letter after it got to The Daily
| Califomiari," she said.
I'urther calls to BE during
the next hour brought the invari
able response from the telephone
I operator:
"The line is busy."
So was "S. Claus." She was ex-
I plaining.
