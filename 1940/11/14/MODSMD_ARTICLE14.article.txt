# Army Reveals Bombsight Deal With England
## 'Outmoded hut Good' Sight Was Traded; New Device Guarded 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 13 (UP).—j
An outmoded, but highly effective j
type of American airplane bomb- !
sight has been delivered to Great |
Britain, it was disclosed today.
The bombsight is not the highly- j
publicized and zealously guarded
secret device now used by U. S. ,
Army and Navy planes.
The news appeared to clear up !
confusion stemming from recur
rent reports that «the secret sight
would be or had been released to
the British. Army and Navy officers
have felt too great a risk might be
involved if the secret device were
made available at this time. Their
chief fear is that it would fall into
German hands.
DEVICE EFFECTIVE
Well-informed sources said the
released sight, though not as accu
rate as the secret device, is highly
effective and incorporates many of
its features. They said officials here
consider it more effective than sights
now being used by the British.
It was revealed two of the out
moded sights were taken to Halifax,
N.S., several weeks ago and placcd
aboard one of the over-age destroy
ers traded by the United States to
Great Britain in the recent swap for
Western Hemisphere bases.
The sights have reached Britain
safely, the United Press informants
said, and are being used experi
mentally.
WELLES EXPLAINS POLICY
It is considered a foregone con
clusion the British will install the
bombsight in the 13 latest-model
"flying fortress" bombers which re
portedly will go to Britain this
month.
Acting Secretai'y of State Sumner
Welles said the United States has
not acquired and does not intend to
acquire military bases from any
Latin American republic. He indi
cated, however, that this country
might accept invitations to share the
use of bases built by the nations
themselves.
This government's position was
set forth by Welles in denying re
ports that the United States was ne
gotiating for lease of air and naval
bases in Uruguay.
