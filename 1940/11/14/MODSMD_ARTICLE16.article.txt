# Stanford to Observe National Thanksgiving
## 
### 
Stanford this year will co-operate
with the rest of the nation in ob
serving the legal (Roosevelt)
Thanksgiving. For the Farm as well
as for all America, Thanksgiving
comes on Thursday, Nov. 21. Stan
ford's vacation will therefore ex
tend from Nov. 21 through Nov. 24.
This means that finals will not
follow Thanksgiving week-end as
was the case last year. Finals week
begins Dec. 10.
