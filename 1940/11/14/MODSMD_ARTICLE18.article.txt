# Farm 'Goes' For Riotous Caricatures
## 
### HAL SHAFER 
Ever had a man make a fool of
you, and make you like it?
There's a man who can do it, and
he's been wowing them on the Row
and on campuses throughout the
country for years.
It's L. C. Ward, professional cari
caturist, who, in the record-breaking
time of about 120 seconds, can take
your visage and make it look like
you just emerged from a refreshing
trip through a washing-machine.
FUNNIEST CREATURE
It looks simple. He sits you down
in a chair for the profile, slaps a
few deft lines on his paper, and
builds around them the funniest
looking creature you've ever seen. J
The best part about the whole proc
ess is that the finished ma.sterpiece
looks like the l'eal thing.
Aesthetes would say he "catches
the real you."
But, whatever it is, he gets a dol
lar a shot, has done nearly every
house on the campus, and is really
cleaning up.
TWELVE-YEAR CAREER
Ward makes Stanford about every
three years. He will tell you he
launched his caricaturing career 12
years ago; in fact, he started cari
caturing his road to fame at Stan
ford. In those days he charged two
bits a portrait.
Since that, time, he has married a
Palo Alto girl, and they travel about
the country in a trailer, caricaturing
as they go. Ward has "done every
college of consequence in the
country."
SWIFT TECHNIQUE
His technique consists of swiftly
setting down his subject's most no
ticeable features with sketch pencil,
and rounding out the job with india
ink. For an additional consideration
he will do the job in color with
crayons.
Ward's ability to catch a person's
most, comical characteristic and to
capitalize on it is the result of many
years' practice, and he takes ad
vantage of every course which he
believes will improve his technique.

and on campuses throughout the
country for years.
It's L. C. Ward, professional cari
caturist, who, in the record-breaking
time of about 120 seconds, can take
your visage and make it look like
you just emerged from a refreshing
trip through a washing-machine.
FUNNIEST CREATURE
It looks simple. He sits you down
in a chair for the profile, slaps a
few deft lines on his paper, and
builds around them the funniest
looking creature you've ever seen. J
The best part about the whole proc
ess is that the finished ma.sterpiece
looks like the l'eal thing.
Aesthetes would say he "catches
the real you."
But, whatever it is, he gets a dol
lar a shot, has done nearly every
house on the campus, and is really
cleaning up.
TWELVE-YEAR CAREER
Ward makes Stanford about every
three years. He will tell you he
launched his caricaturing career 12
years ago; in fact, he started cari
caturing his road to fame at Stan
ford. In those days he charged two
bits a portrait.
Since that, time, he has married a
Palo Alto girl, and they travel about
the country in a trailer, caricaturing
as they go. Ward has "done every
college of consequence in the
country."
SWIFT TECHNIQUE
His technique consists of swiftly
setting down his subject's most no
ticeable features with sketch pencil,
and rounding out the job with india
ink. For an additional consideration
he will do the job in color with
crayons.
Ward's ability to catch a person's
most, comical characteristic and to
capitalize on it is the result of many
years' practice, and he takes ad
vantage of every course which he
believes will improve his technique.
