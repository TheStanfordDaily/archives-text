# Dr. Cheney Talks On 'Malingering'
## 
### 
Dr. Garnett Cheney spoke to the
Stanford Pre-Medical Society last
night about "Malingering," which is
the practice of faking illness to get
out of doing something unpleasant.
The doctors who have been ap
pointed to examine draftees have
received instructions to watch
carefully for any signs of malinger
ing in the men thoy examine.
In the last draft, for the first
World War, it has since been proved
that there was a tremendously high
number of men who didn't go to
war who actually hadn't a thing
wrong with them. In a military hos
pital in San Francisco it was esti
mated that about 20 per cent of all
the patients weren't sick at all.
A large percentage of supposedly
disabled veterans, who are drawing
compensations up to $100 a month,
are really malingerers. Dr. Cheney
said. But it is at times very hard to
decide whether a person is sick or
faking. To determine this doctors
first notice whether the person's
actions arc suspicious, if he has ex
aggerated symptoms, is vague, or
not co-operative.
