# Cold Wave Flows East; Many Killed
## Property Damages Mount into Millions In Central States 
### (By United Press 
A wave of hitter cold flowed east- 1
ward Wednesday night across the |
central states and the Great Lakes
region, following a storm that bat
tered cities and shipping, killed at
least 121} persons, and destroyed
crops, livestock and property.
As wind diminished over Lake
Michigan, hardest hit of the Great
Lakes which suffered their greatest
November storm, Coast Guardsmen
reported six boats sunk, six ground
ed and scores of small craft torn to
pieces. The bodies of 18 seamen
had been recovered along the
wreckage-scattered Michigan shore.
Fifty-one were missing and feared
dead.
SHIPPING DESTROYED
Temperatures as low as 5 de
grees were expected in the Lake
Michigan area Wednesday night..
Amid such shivering temperatures
Coast Guardsmen and volunteers
went, about the task of searching
Lake Michigan for missing seamen.
Survivors told of 70-mile-an-hour
gales that whipped up waves 30 feet
high, blinding snowstorms and dar
ing rescues.
Freighters ranging from 200 to 600
feet long were piled around the
lake's shores like match sticks.
Those that went down were ground
to bits on rocks.
Only California and Florida es
caped the cold wave which had
sent temperatures below zero in the
northern tier of states from the
Rockies to Michigan and brought
readings elsewhere in the nation to
20 to 30 degrees below normal.
COLD TO CONTINUE
The U. S. Weather Bureau at Chi
cago forecast continued cold for
most areas Wednesday night and
Thursday.
Temperatui-es had declined only
slightly in eastern states as the cold
winds spent their force in the Ap
palachians, but freezing was fore
cast for New England and the
middle Atlantic states tonight. New
York City's temperature was ex
pected to drop to the 20's by Thurs
day. Chilling rains fell along the
seaboard.
HUNTERS LOST
Zero readings were reported as
far south as centi-al Kansas and Mis
souri, with the extreme cold cen
tered in a belt from Montana across
the Dakotas, lowa and Minnesota.
One of the heaviest death tolls was
taken among duck hunters along the
Mississippi River at least 25 froze
or drowned and several were miss
ing.
In three days, the storm, follow
ing an erratic course eastward from
the Rocky Mountains, had, in addi
tion to the deaths, injured hun
dreds and caused uncounted mil
lions of dollars' property damage
from tornadoes, blizzards, sleet and
rain.
