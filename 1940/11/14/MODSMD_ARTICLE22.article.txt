# Britain Boasts Crippling Half Italy's Battleships; 'Empire Balance Renewed'
## 
### 
LONDON, Nov. 13 (UP). —Britain rejoiced tonight at a daring Royal
Naval attack which restored a British balance of naval power in the
Mediterranean by crippling half of Italy's battleships.
Within a 24-hour period, the Admiralty announced, 12 Italian wur
ships and supply vessels were sunk, crippled or damaged by flfet air arm

and surface units in two pitched
battles.
The action was in two engage
ments—a fleet air attack in force on
the Italian main battle fleet at its
Taranto base and an attack by Brit
ish light surface vessels on an es
corted Italian convoy, in the Straits
of Otranto. The most spectacular,
and the most damaging to Italy, was
at Taranto.
THK MAIN ACTION
At Taranto, the British said they
wrecked two battleships, two cruis
ers, and two auxiliary warships. A
third battleship was believed badly
damaged. This, if true, knocks out
one-third to a half of Italy's capital
ships.
Taranto is inside the heel of the
Italian boot; the narrow Straits of
Otranto separate Italy and Albania.
"The result of this action affects
decisively the balance of naval
power in the Mediterranean," the
Admiralty reported. "The result
also carries with it reactions to the
naval situation in other parts of the
globe."
FIRST SUCCESS
The air attack at Taranto was the
first successful major naval action
where planes won a decisive victory
over ships of the line. The aircraft
faced concentrated shore fire in
addition to a tremendous concen
tration of high angle guns.
In the second action a squadron
of light forces operating on the
main line of Italian communications
across the Straits of Otranto between
Italy and Albania intercepted off the
Albanian port of Valona an enemy
convoy consisting of four supply
ships escorted by two destroyers.
