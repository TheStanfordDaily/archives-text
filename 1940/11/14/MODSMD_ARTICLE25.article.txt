# Kreps Proposes Revising U.S. Taxation Methods
## 
### 
"Almost every American tax is paid directly by the consumer."
And this, according to Dr. Theodore Kreps, prominent New Dealer
and Stanford associate professor of business economics, necessitates an
extensive reorganization of United States taxation methods. He spoke
last night before 45 members of Pi Sigma Alpha, political science hon
orary, at a dinner meeting in thd*

Union.
"The families whose income aver
ages less than $60 a month bear the
greatest proportionate burden of
taxation in the nation," Dr. Kreps
declared.

As economic adviser to the Tem
porary National Economic Commit
tee, he said that the major recom
mendation of that committee "prob
ably would be" revision of existing
taxation laws, the "closing of all
loopholes to obviate passing taxes
from industry to consumer."
Turning from this theme, he dis
cussed the concentration of eco
nomic power in the hands of a few
men, comparing this rapid growth of
centralization in America with
similar cartelization in Europe.
"Three-fourths of all capital re
turn in America is received by less
than half a million people," he said.
"In addition, this same small group
earns 10 per cent of the salaries of
the country.
STOCKHOLDERS A MYTH
"The 200 largest corporations in
1 his country are controlled by about
75,000 people. The myth of 'mil-
Tons and millions of stockholders all
over the country' is just that — a
myth," he continued.
Aside from this small controlling
Toe, other stockholders may hold
it few isolated shares which allows
them little power, he declared.
"Today such large economic col-
T -tives as U. S. Steel cannot be
c; lied individual enterprises. They
si. are all the characteristics of gov
< rnment—they have legislative and
executive branches, are vast finance
-items," he said.

"Almost every American tax is paid directly by the consumer."
And this, according to Dr. Theodore Kreps, prominent New Dealer
and Stanford associate professor of business economics, necessitates an
extensive reorganization of United States taxation methods. He spoke
last night before 45 members of Pi Sigma Alpha, political science hon
orary, at a dinner meeting in thd*

Union.
"The families whose income aver
ages less than $60 a month bear the
greatest proportionate burden of
taxation in the nation," Dr. Kreps
declared.
TO PLUG LOOPHOLES
As economic adviser to the Tem
porary National Economic Commit
tee, he said that the major recom
mendation of that committee "prob
ably would be" revision of existing
taxation laws, the "closing of all
loopholes to obviate passing taxes
from industry to consumer."
Turning from this theme, he dis
cussed the concentration of eco
nomic power in the hands of a few
men, comparing this rapid growth of
centralization in America with
similar cartelization in Europe.
"Three-fourths of all capital re
turn in America is received by less
than half a million people," he said.
"In addition, this same small group
earns 10 per cent of the salaries of
the country.
STOCKHOLDERS A MYTH
"The 200 largest corporations in
1 his country are controlled by about
75,000 people. The myth of 'mil-
Tons and millions of stockholders all
over the country' is just that — a
myth," he continued.
Aside from this small controlling
Toe, other stockholders may hold
it few isolated shares which allows
them little power, he declared.
"Today such large economic col-
T -tives as U. S. Steel cannot be
c; lied individual enterprises. They
si. are all the characteristics of gov
< rnment—they have legislative and
executive branches, are vast finance
-items," he said.
