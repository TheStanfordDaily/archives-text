# N.Y. Fashion School Offers Five Fellowships to Seniors
## 
### PEGGY JADDEN 
You expect to graduate in June—only seven months away. Then
what? By that time, Big Game, Stanford's trip to the Rose Bowl, the
Junior Prom, and Stanford in the Spring will be merely memories of
what has probably been the happiest year of your life.
Four years of work and pleasure have flown by. You suddenly

realize that you have no particular,
outstanding talent. If you're an
English major you think you can
write. If you've been in the Gaieties
you think you can sing or dance. If
you've a flair for clothes, someone
suggests that fashion is the most
rewarding career for women. They're
right. It is.
So you go job-hunting. All at
once you discover that jobs are
scarce even for college graduates,
and the uncertainty of the times
does not help this condition. And
still you want to be on your own!
But how? Do not apply unprepared
for that position. What you need is
specialized training.
The Tobe-Cobum School in New
York City offers that training to
carefully selected young women in
an intensive one-year course.
While art schools throughout the
country are training thousands of
women for the field of costume de
sign, this is the only school to spe
icalize in preparing its students for
fashion work in which ideas are at a
premium but ability in drawing or
designing is noX essential. It accepts
only young women with two or
more years of college training, be
cause a good cultural background
and a well disciplined mind are es
sential to receive full value from
the course. On graduation almost
every girl in the school is absorbed
into stores and magazines through
out the country.

The Tobe-Coburn School is now
offering its annual award to college
seniors. Five fashion fellowships
for the year 1941-42 will be com
petitively awarded to those who
show the greatest aptitude for fash
ion work. Each fashion fellowship
covers the full year's tuition of $700.
Hari'iet Witbeck of Stanford won
the fellowship the year before last.
Other Stanford graduates now at
tending arc Pamela Steffan and
Jean Reynolds. Why not increase
Stanford's representation? Ap
plicants must register and complete
first test questions before Decem
ber 10. Registration blanks may be
obtained from Peggy Jadden. You
might be the lucky one!

and a well disciplined mind are es
sential to receive full value from
the course. On graduation almost
every girl in the school is absorbed
into stores and magazines through
out the country.

The Tobe-Coburn School is now
offering its annual award to college
seniors. Five fashion fellowships
for the year 1941-42 will be com

Other Stanford graduates now at
tending arc Pamela Steffan and
Jean Reynolds. Why not increase
Stanford's representation? Ap

You expect to graduate in June—only seven months away. Then
what? By that time, Big Game, Stanford's trip to the Rose Bowl, the
Junior Prom, and Stanford in the Spring will be merely memories of
what has probably been the happiest year of your life.
Four years of work and pleasure have flown by. You suddenly

realize that you have no particular,
outstanding talent. If you're an
English major you think you can
write. If you've been in the Gaieties
you think you can sing or dance. If
you've a flair for clothes, someone
suggests that fashion is the most
rewarding career for women. They're
right. It is.
So you go job-hunting. All at
once you discover that jobs are
scarce even for college graduates,
and the uncertainty of the times
does not help this condition. And
still you want to be on your own!
But how? Do not apply unprepared
for that position. What you need is
specialized training.
The Tobe-Cobum School in New
York City offers that training to
carefully selected young women in
an intensive one-year course.
While art schools throughout the
country are training thousands of
women for the field of costume de
sign, this is the only school to spe
icalize in preparing its students for
fashion work in which ideas are at a
premium but ability in drawing or
designing is noX essential. It accepts
only young women with two or
more years of college training, be
cause a good cultural background
and a well disciplined mind are es
sential to receive full value from
the course. On graduation almost
