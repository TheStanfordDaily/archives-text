## 
### 
Stanford opened its 1940-41 sea
son with a surprising but well
earned tie with Utah's Kedskins,
3-3. yesterday afternoon on High
way Field.
Patrick Fenton, Ute captain, and
Bill Dirker, Stanford No. 1, tied for
high goal honors with two tallies
each. However, it was the defensive
work of Stan Glikbarg and the all
field play of Joe Smith that high
lighted the play of the locals.
Stanford took an early lead over
the favored team from Utah when
Dirker scored in the final seconds
of the second chukker. The Red
skins from the Mountain States
came back to tie the score in the
third due to the work of Captain
Fenton and Hubert Nuttle, their
No. 2 man.
The fourth period saw both teams
score a goal on shots by Glickbarg
and Fenton. Dirker swept in an
approach shot made by Glickbarg,
who had received the ball from
Smith after the latter had taken
the pellet the length of the field, to
give the Cards temporary lead in
the fifth chukker.
A last-minute foul shot by Fenton
tied the score up in the last period,
3 to 3.
The two teams will meet again
Friday afternoon for a return
match. The first goal scored will
decide the winner of yesterday's
deadlock.
