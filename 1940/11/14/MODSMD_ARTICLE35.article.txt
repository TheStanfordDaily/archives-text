# Hoopsters Prep For Hamlin Clash
## 
### 
While Stanford's "Wow Boys" j
have been running wild on the
gridiron. Coach Everett Dean's bas
ketballers, completely out of the
limelight, have been hard at work
getting ready for the coming season, j
which opens the first Monday after
the Hig Game.
At that time the Indians will meel
Hamlin University, of St. Paul, a
team that is going to play several
coast universities before the start of
Christmas vacation. The Hamlin
game will be the Indians' only con- !
test before the start of the new !
year.
Coach Dean started his charges j
practicing on an outdoor program j
three times a week shortly after the !
beginning of fall quarter; and it |
wasn't until the last week in Octo- !
ber that the hoopsters moved into [
the Pavilion for their workouts.
Since the first of November the j
basketball team, cut to 22 men to j
aid speedy practice, has been prac- j
t icing daily In anticipation of its
first game. With all the regulars
from last year's second-place outfit,
with the exception of Leon LaFaille,
returning this season, the prospects
are bright for a successful season.
Coach Dean is waiting to see the !
team in action against a tough op
ponent, however, before making any
predictions for the coming season.
