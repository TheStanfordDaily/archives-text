# Trackmen to Hold Intrasquad Meet
## 
### 
The high jump and hundred will
hold the spotlight in tomorrow's
intrasquad track meet at Angell
Field.
Ken Battaglia, captain of the Reds,
will have his hands full in the cen
tury trying to beat out Bob Waters,
a frosh with a sensational high
school record at Bakersfield, where
both he and Jack Trout ran 9.7.
Jim Lincoln, White captain, faces
Vein Hart in the high jump. Hart,
frosh co-captain last year with Ed
Stamm, was out for weeks but is
now in good shape.

When driving through fog at
night, sit us high in the seat as
possible, and use the low beam of
your headlights. This takes advan
tage of the belt just above the
ground where the fog is least dense.
