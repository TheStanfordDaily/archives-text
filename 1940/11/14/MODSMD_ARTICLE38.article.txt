# Indian Gridders Plot Defense; Kmetovic Hurt
## 
### 
Coach Clark Shaughncssy and hb
hoard «»f strategy continued yester
day to instruct Stanford's unbeaten,
untied footballers how to stop the
offense of their next opponent. Ore
gon State.
Those Beavers from the north are
be juiid to throw everything in their
books against the Cardinals in a
desperate last ditch defense of their
Rose Bowl hopes. Early in the sea
son, Coach Lon Stiner's men were
tabbed along with U.S.C. and Wash
ington as the potential winners of
the Pacific Coast Conference.
Since then the Huskies have fallen
before the startling Indians and the
Trojans have been tripped by both
California and Stanford. This means
that the Beavers, with only one
conference defeat against their
credit aie the only gridders who
have a chance of snatching the
treasured Bowl bid from Shaugh
nessy & Co.
IF O.S.C. WINS
For if Stiner's men turn the trick
on Stanford and Cal's fast improv
ing Bears can turn back the In
dians, it might mean a New Year's
Day of roses lor the northerners,
providing Washington drops another
of their remaining games. Apart
from their hopes of the Rose Bowl,
Oregon State will have the added
incentive of being the team to solve
the Shaughnessy mystery, some
thing which seven other elevens
have failed to do.
For these reasons, plus the fact
that the Cardinals have their of
fense pretty well polished, Shaugh
nessy has been concentrating on his
team's planned defense for this
coming Saturday's contest.
KMETOVIC INJURED
Pete Kmetovic, the Card speed
merchant, spent yesterday's prac
tice on the sidelines again, still rest
ing Lip from the charley horse he
picked up in the Washington game.
And in practice another first stringer
was laid up with a minor injury.
Stan Graff, veteran end, suffered a
rather severe cramp in his leg but
he is expected, along with Kmetovic,
to be ready to go come Saturday
afternoon.
Meanwhile the regular first string
backfield, with the exception of Milt
Vucinich in place of Norm Standlee, \
went ahead learning their assign
ments for stopping the highly touted
Oregon passing attack which spelled i
Cal's defeat.
In the line it looks as though the
same seven that started against !
Washington will take over at 2 p.m. :
Saturday. This means that Chuck
Taylor will be back at his old spot 1
at starting left guard and that Ed
Stamm, the reserve who made good,
will be in there at left tackle.

Trojans have been tripped by both
California and Stanford. This means
that the Beavers, with only one
conference defeat against their
credit aie the only gridders who
have a chance of snatching the
treasured Bowl bid from Shaugh

IF O.S.C. WINS
For if Stiner's men turn the trick
on Stanford and Cal's fast improv
ing Bears can turn back the In
dians, it might mean a New Year's
Day of roses lor the northerners,
providing Washington drops another
of their remaining games. Apart
from their hopes of the Rose Bowl,
Oregon State will have the added
incentive of being the team to solve
the Shaughnessy mystery, some
thing which seven other elevens
have failed to do.
For these reasons, plus the fact
that the Cardinals have their of

nessy has been concentrating on his
team's planned defense for this
coming Saturday's contest.

picked up in the Washington game.

was laid up with a minor injury.
Stan Graff, veteran end, suffered a
rather severe cramp in his leg but
he is expected, along with Kmetovic,
to be ready to go come Saturday
afternoon.

Vucinich in place of Norm Standlee, \

Oregon passing attack which spelled i
Cal's defeat.

Washington will take over at 2 p.m. :
Saturday. This means that Chuck
Taylor will be back at his old spot 1
at starting left guard and that Ed
Stamm, the reserve who made good,
will be in there at left tackle.
