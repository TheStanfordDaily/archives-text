# Card Kickers Whip Bulldogs

### 
After trailing at half time, Stan
ford's varsity soccer team rallied
valiantly to push over two scores
in the second half and defeat the
surprisingly stubborn San Mateo
Junior College Bulldogs, :i-2.
Coach Maloney in anticipation of
a breather started the second team
and the Mateans promptly piled up
a 2-0 lead by the end of the first
quarter. The first-stringers were
lushed ir. immediately, and after a
shaky start they tallied on a pen
ally kick by George Dole.
In the third period, another pen
alty kick by George Dole and a
spectacular left-footed shot by Joe
McHarg from the side gave the
Indians the lead they never relin
quished.
The outstanding man of the game,
however, was center forward Fred
Forest of San Mateo, who dribbled
the Indian defenders silly and ac
counted lor his team's two tallies.
