; r Underwood has been pound
! ing out the same tune all sea
-1 son, and I'm just about as tired of it
as you are, but here we go again.
Once more the Indians must turn
on the pressure and beat a very
tough football team in order to con
tinue their march on the Rose Bowl.
Before every game this season we've
said, quote -/This is the oneâ€”un
quote. Now Clark Shaughnessy's
great team is up against the last
obstacle between it and the Rose i
Eowl. <
We're not ignoring California
Nov. .'!(). That, too, will be a bruis
ing battle, but the Big Game is a
separate crusade. This Saturday,
if the Indians can Dam the Beav
ers without the aid of Chief Norm
Standlee, they'll have cinched the
conference championship and the
Pasadena nomination.
One of the big attractions of the
' Oregon State-Stanford fracas has ;
gone up in smoke. All year this col- |
umn has been looking forward to j
the meeting between the Coast's two
greatest fullbacks, Norm Standlee j
arid Jim Kisselburgh, great Beaver
point-getter.
A bad leg that will keep Norm I
out of a suit will prevent the final
chapter being written in a five-year
series between the two. Their
rivalry dates back to the days when
they played on rival teams in their j
high school days down in Long
| Beach.
In the past Kisselburgh's teams
were victorious three times, Stand
lee was on the winning squad only
once. Saturday was to be the
game of revenge, the game in
which Norm would be ahlv enough
supported to show his real worth
and lead his team to a win.
It was also to be the last appear
ance Norm would make in a cardi
nal uniform on the turf of Stanford
Stadium. Those of us who have
watched him play these last three !

seasons would have liked to see him
play in this last home game, would
have liked to see him get the cheers
he deserves after having a hand in
winning that game.
But it isn't going to work that
way. so we'll just have to wait until
the Chief mops up Cal to bring The
Axe back to the Farm, and let him
know what we think of him then.
HPIIE Wow Boys now rank fourth
in stature among the nation's
football teams, only Minnesota.
( crnell and Texas A & M ranking
above them in that order on the
A.P. weekly football poll.
I won't deny being prejudiced, but j
my personal ranking differs from j
this a bit. I d put the Indians and :
Texas A & M bracketed on top un
til they prove which is the best
team in the Rose Bowl (I hope) on
the first day of 1941.
Minnesota has played a tough
schedule and come out well, but i
they lucked bv Washington early,
while the Indians beat the Huskies
decisively at their peak.
As for Cornell, the Big "Un
read has laced only one foe of
major character this season, Ohio
State. They won that one, and
there's no doubt that they're a
good team, but I'd like to see how
they'd make out in the Coast or
Western Conferences.
