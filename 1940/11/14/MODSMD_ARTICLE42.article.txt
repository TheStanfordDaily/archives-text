# kappa Sigs Defeat Encima 4W
## 
### 
A vastly underrated Encina 4W
football team came within a lew
points yesterday of pulling the big
gest upset in intramurals this year.
It scored two touchdowns against
a tricky Kappa Sig outfit, but the
Row team converted twice to win,
14-12.
Both of the winners' scores were
made on long gains, one a pass from
Lanpehier to Harris for a net gain
ol 63 yards, the other a pass from
Lanpehier to Snedecour on a sleeper
play for 50 yards. Throughout the
season the Kappa Sigs have used the
sleeper play to good advantage.
The Encinamen tallied once on a
long pass trom Clark to Smith, and
again after a steady march down
the field. The score was made on a
short pass from Clark to Crosby.
In a game having no bearing on
the all - Univeifcity championship,
the S.A.E.'s downed a slower Bran
ner team, 6-0. The only score of
the game was made on a beautiful
pass from Knight Raymond to Bob
Newell. The winners passed up two
other scoring opportunities with
poor passes.
Saturday the first running of the

intramural Irish relay will take
place. The marathon will be three
miles long, starting at Angell Field,
progressing up to the Phi Sig house,
past the Museum, and back to the
field. A team will consist of 12 run
ners, each man running 440 yards.
Irophies will be awarded to the first,
