# Ballots Preferred
## 
### 
ONE single identifying slant which almost
every national or municipal poll uses to
the fullest are these words; "A representative
cross-section yesterday showed that . . ."
Monday a representative cross-section of the
freshman class elected its officers for the year
1940-1941.
Three hundred sixty Roble Farmerettes and
Encinamen filed to the polls to cast their ballots
for these offices. Almost three hundred more
stayed at home. Result? Slightly more than
half the frosh elected the officers which are to
represent the class of '44 during their first year
on the Farm.
At that, the percentage of votes cast was
higher than almost every spring quarter or mid
year election of recent years. Under the im
pelling force of national election year, the frosh
turned in the most representative vote since
1936.
In last year's spring quarter elections, the
most hotly contested and most talked-of cam
pus election in at least the past four years, not
even half the student body even bothered to
trek to the polls a\id mark their ballots.
Today's student officials, without exception,
are men and women of the highest caliber. But
when you get down to it, they reached their
positions through elections in which an appall
ingly small percentage of the campus electorate
partook.
It's not the fault of any system or of any
trend. The privilege of casting a vote in campus
elections is available to each and every stu
dent.
Inertia and a don't-give-a-damn atitude on the
part of the student electorate is the cause. What
the cure for this year-long brand of "spring
fever" might be, I don't know.
Any sort of reform coming from without
would be impossible. If students don't care
who wins what position, if they don't care to
exercise their voting prerogative, nothing can
be done.
A "representative cross - section" will pick
their officers for them.â€”W. C.
