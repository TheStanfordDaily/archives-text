# The 						Preferential Ballot
## 
### 
THREE hundred sixty frosh filed to the Quad
polls yesterday from 8:30 to 2 o'clock to vote
in their first Stanford election. The frosh were
handed their ballots, reached for pens, and were
faced with what was probably their initial meet
ing with the preferential system of voting.
Few of their ballots were invalidated through
incorrect marking. This can probably be at
tributed to native intelligence on the part of '44
rather than to a quick grasp of the voting system
itself.
A good many people on the Farm have found
that system a bit tough to fathom. Many of
those who do understand it remain dubious as
to the usefulness of the preferential ballot.
The system is good. The only time it might
kick-back upon those who vote under it is when
the voters are unable to fathom its workings.
The preferential ballot is both a general and
primary election rolled into one. The number of
men in the running won't affect the ultimate
outcome in any manner. Even if every glamour
boy and 8.W.0.C. on the campus tosses his or
her bonnet in the ring the system will eventu
ally reflect the campus' predominant choice.
Voting for the candidate you prefer is simple.
Merely indicate on the ballot that he is your
first choice for that office. If his name is not on
the ballot, write him in and then give him your
vote.
So far it's simple. Then you think, "Joe Doakes
is the only one who will give my candidate
trouble. He's the next best man but I want my
man to win. I'll give Doakes last place on the
ballot."
There's where the mistakes are made. Every
voter must realize that he should have an al
ternate candidate in the event that his«man does
not gain a majority. But unless your first choice
candidate is last man on the first choice list, the
second choice votes you cast will not be
counted.
Only when your candidate has a smaller total
than any other man, will his name be discarded
and the second choice votes on your ballot be
used.
In the event that your man is eliminated, the
man you like next best for the position should
receive your second choice vote. But if you
hide him far down the ballot to protect your
first choice man an inferior candidate may re
ceive your second choice vote.
For purposes of illustration, let us conduct a
mock election with Emery Bellwether, Joe
Doakes, Ken Jones, and Edgar Murgatroyd in
the running.
On the first ballot Bellwether led with a count

of 400. Doakes was second with 350, Murga
troyd third with 200, and Jones trailed with 150.
No one had a majority of the 1100 votes cast.
Jones, the low man, is dropped and his second
choice votes are tallied. Bellwether got 25 of
them for a total of 425; Doakes received 25 also
for a total of 325; Murgatroyd received the re
maining 100 for a total of 300 votes. Still no one
has gained the majority necessary for election.
Murgatroyd, the last man, is eliminated leav
ing only Bellwether and Doakes in the running.
On a tabulation of the second choice votes on
Murgatroyd's ballots Bellwether receives 200
for a total of 625 and the majority necessary for
election.
The example is over and the point made.
Give the preferential balloting system a chance
the next time you use it. It has the confidence
of the leaders among the Farm political factions.
Properly used it cannot help but express the
choice of the campus electorate.—W. C.

No one had a majority of the 1100 votes cast.
Jones, the low man, is dropped and his second
choice votes are tallied. Bellwether got 25 of
them for a total of 425; Doakes received 25 also
for a total of 325; Murgatroyd received the re
maining 100 for a total of 300 votes. Still no one
has gained the majority necessary for election.
Murgatroyd, the last man, is eliminated leav
ing only Bellwether and Doakes in the running.
On a tabulation of the second choice votes on
Murgatroyd's ballots Bellwether receives 200
for a total of 625 and the majority necessary for
election.

THREE hundred sixty frosh filed to the Quad
polls yesterday from 8:30 to 2 o'clock to vote
in their first Stanford election. The frosh were
handed their ballots, reached for pens, and were
faced with what was probably their initial meet
ing with the preferential system of voting.
Few of their ballots were invalidated through
incorrect marking. This can probably be at
tributed to native intelligence on the part of '44
rather than to a quick grasp of the voting system
itself.
A good many people on the Farm have found
that system a bit tough to fathom. Many of
those who do understand it remain dubious as
to the usefulness of the preferential ballot.
The system is good. The only time it might
kick-back upon those who vote under it is when
the voters are unable to fathom its workings.
The preferential ballot is both a general and
primary election rolled into one. The number of
men in the running won't affect the ultimate
outcome in any manner. Even if every glamour
boy and 8.W.0.C. on the campus tosses his or
her bonnet in the ring the system will eventu
ally reflect the campus' predominant choice.
Voting for the candidate you prefer is simple.
Merely indicate on the ballot that he is your
first choice for that office. If his name is not on
the ballot, write him in and then give him your
vote.
So far it's simple. Then you think, "Joe Doakes
is the only one who will give my candidate
trouble. He's the next best man but I want my
man to win. I'll give Doakes last place on the
ballot."
There's where the mistakes are made. Every
voter must realize that he should have an al
ternate candidate in the event that his«man does
not gain a majority. But unless your first choice
candidate is last man on the first choice list, the
second choice votes you cast will not be
counted.
Only when your candidate has a smaller total
than any other man, will his name be discarded
and the second choice votes on your ballot be
used.
In the event that your man is eliminated, the
man you like next best for the position should
receive your second choice vote. But if you
hide him far down the ballot to protect your
first choice man an inferior candidate may re
ceive your second choice vote.
For purposes of illustration, let us conduct a
mock election with Emery Bellwether, Joe
Doakes, Ken Jones, and Edgar Murgatroyd in
the running.
On the first ballot Bellwether led with a count

of 400. Doakes was second with 350, Murga
troyd third with 200, and Jones trailed with 150.
No one had a majority of the 1100 votes cast.
