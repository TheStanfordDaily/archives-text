yHAT's what comes from going off half-cocked. The
facts get jumbled, and jumbled facts rarely prove
effective. All this build-up is again concerned with
this subject of checking student body tickets.
Yesterday the word was that every student paid
10 greenies to the B.A.C. for the privilege of going to
football games. This is not true. A super-super state
ment from Dick Stepp, student manager, the man who
knows where the money goes, shows that the B.A.C.
itself gets only $1 from each man and 50 cents from
cach woman when all the chips are in.
With that out of the way, it might be added that
the question of the student prices does not at present
appear to be the major complaint.
It seems to be the method used by the B.A.C. to
check students at the gate. Here is the bottleneck.
This IS true.
The trouble with the present system, as was pointed
out in the last Excom meeting, is that it is ineffective.
* * « #
Saturday, according to report, the B.A.C.
grabbed a little over 60 cards. The estimation
was that this number of unhappy card holders repre
sented about one-third of the people who attempted
this little gate-crashing stunt.
But what is mystifying is the fact that after grab
bing a student body card from a non-student, the
gatemen let these "crooks" go on into the game any
way.
Mathematically figured this was a very good gamble
for all the non-student crashers. Let's see! It cost
them $2 to retrieve a taken student-body card. And
it cost them $1.50 for a regular ticket.
In other words, they were gambling $2 against
$1.50. All they stood to lose was 50 cents at the most.
And since the gatemen were catching only one-third
of them, the gamble became almost as good as betting
on Joe Louis.
And to make the thing even better, if it worked,
they stood to get a better seat., in the center rooting
section. And all they gambled was 50 cents.

JN OTHER words, the B.A.C. was trying to beat a
50-cent gamble. But with all this silly messing around
all they did accomplish was to tie up all the proceed
ings and the card punching at the student gate. They
questioned real students, while they let pass many
people who had never seen the Farm before except
in newsreels.
The result was that deserving and rightful students
missed part of the game—in some cases almost the
whole first quarter.
And while we're on the subject of the student gate,
a little suggestion from a big-wig on Men's Council
(an organization that thinks before it speaks) might
prove* worthy of your consideration.
"Isn't there some way that the student gate could
be enlarged, if the B.A.C. is going to check all these
cards, this fellow suggested. "I counted about seven
gatemen at the student gate. With all this monkey
business that is too small a number to check the cards
jf over 4000 students."

And, oh yes—the Stanford Dames are not the wives
of the faculty. They arc the wives of Stanford
students.
