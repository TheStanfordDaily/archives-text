## THANKS 
### 
T'HE EDITOR. SIR:
As general chairman of the dance committee
for the Roble Formal, I want to give a vote of thanks
to all tlie girls whose assistance made it a success.
Thus, this letter, since the columns of The Daily seem
to offer the best medium for making my appreciation
public.
Thanks should go mainly to these committee chair
men: Betty Blystone, decorations; Emily Howard, or
chestra; Dodie Crile, reception; Ailce Parks, refresh
ments; Dione Holmes, patrons; Eleanor Hyman, tick
ets; Jane Williams, clean-up; and Mary Bills, mis
cellaneous. To all their committee members who
worked so well with them goes my gratitude also.
Mary Jean Hayncs
