AT LEAST SEVEN persons were killed and forty others seriously injured when an explosion razed the
United Railway and Signal Company's plant at Woodbridge, N.J. (above), shortly before blasts in two
Pennsylvania powder plants killed at least six persons. The Federal Bureau of Investigation launched a
probe on the three explosions.
