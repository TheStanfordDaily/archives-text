# WHERE IT GOES

'[W EDITOR. SIR:
Because of the misunderstanding and misrepre
sentation made in letters to "Campus Opinion" during
the past two mornings regarding the division of the
SIS community fees paid by each student per quarter,
I should like to help to clarify the situation.
Tlie .$l5 fees are divided in the following manner:
Guild Fees (Health Service) $ 5.00
Gym 5.00
A. S. S. U 1.25
Stanford Daily 75
Union and Clubhouse 1.00
Theater 1.00
B. A. C 1.00
Total $15.00
The guild fee of $5 covers medical services and a
portion of students' hospital expenses. Five dollars
from each woman student goes to the women's gym,
and $5 from each man to the men's gym for the privi
leges of the gymnasia and athletic grounds. The $10
going to these two budgets may have created the im
pression that the B.A.C. receives $10 per student for
the privileges of seeing games. Such is not the case,
for the B.A.C. receives only $1 per student, and of
each dollar obtained per woman student, the B.A.C.
remits 50 cents to the Women's Athletic Association per
quarter.
Should anyone wish to know more of the details
of the community fee, I will be very happy to discuss
the matter with him at any time.
Dick Stepp.
Student Manager, A.S.S.U.
