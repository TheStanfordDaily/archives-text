# Robeson Packs Theatre To Open Concert Season
## 
### 
The same "Old Man River," which caused an otherwise mediocre per
formance of "Show Boat" to play to packed houses last spring in the
Geary Theater, brought thunderous applause Tuesday night when the
Opera Association presented Paul Robeson in the first of this season's

concert attractions. i
In a concert which inevitably fea
tured the spirituals of his race,
Robeson reaffirmed his reputation as
one of the world's great bassos. His
"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot," "Deep
River," "Go Down Moses" and
"Prayer" (a plea for the end of the
sorrow and suffering of the negro
race) had a richness and warmth of
interpretation that kept the audi
ence clamoring in their places for
12 encores.
But it was in his group of real
istic national songs by Mussorgsky,
the English folk-song, "Oh No,
John," arranged by Cecil Sharp, and
"She Is Far from the Land," an old
Irish melody arranged by Stanford,
that the colored bass' mastery of
concert techniques was most clearly
seen. With volume and range that
is seldom heard in one but the
Wagnerian specialists, still he is ca
pable of expression and meaning that
makes for the most sympathetic
handling of anything he sings.
SPIRITUALS FEATURED
Among his 'encores, Robeson in
cluded the new "Ballad for Ameri
cans" by John Latouche and Earl
Robinson, "Water Boy," "Journey's
End," "Oh, Ma Baby" and "Scan
dalize Ma Name," an amusing negro
secular song.
His accompanist, Lawrence Brown,
who arranged most of the spirituals,
complemented and collaborated with
the gigantic negro singer on two of
the evening's offerings. "Joshua Fit
dc Battle of Jericho" and "Lil David,
Play on Your Harp" were done in
inimitable camp meeting style with
both Brown and Robeson obviously
enjoying their rendition and its re
ception.
INTERMISSION SOLOIST
Robeson was assisted by Clara
Rockmore, who presented two
groups of selections on the There
min. The Theremin, which looks
like a gadget in a Flash Gordon
drawing, is played by controlling
electric oscillations by movement of
the two hands in the electro-mag
netic field about the instrument. The
performer never touches it.
Even the intervals of music from
this unusual contrivance could not
detract from Robeson's concert,
which provided one of the most sat
isfactory musical evenings that
anyone, music lover or not, could
hope to have.—Farrell

the evening's offerings. "Joshua Fit
dc Battle of Jericho" and "Lil David,
Play on Your Harp" were done in
inimitable camp meeting style with
both Brown and Robeson obviously
enjoying their rendition and its re
ception.
INTERMISSION SOLOIST
Robeson was assisted by Clara
Rockmore, who presented two
groups of selections on the There
min. The Theremin, which looks
like a gadget in a Flash Gordon
drawing, is played by controlling
electric oscillations by movement of
the two hands in the electro-mag
netic field about the instrument. The
performer never touches it.
Even the intervals of music from
this unusual contrivance could not
detract from Robeson's concert,
which provided one of the most sat
isfactory musical evenings that
anyone, music lover or not, could
hope to have.—Farrell
The same "Old Man River," which caused an otherwise mediocre per
formance of "Show Boat" to play to packed houses last spring in the
Geary Theater, brought thunderous applause Tuesday night when the
Opera Association presented Paul Robeson in the first of this season's

concert attractions. i
In a concert which inevitably fea
tured the spirituals of his race,
Robeson reaffirmed his reputation as
one of the world's great bassos. His
"Swing Low, Sweet Chariot," "Deep
River," "Go Down Moses" and
"Prayer" (a plea for the end of the
sorrow and suffering of the negro
race) had a richness and warmth of
interpretation that kept the audi
ence clamoring in their places for
12 encores.
But it was in his group of real
istic national songs by Mussorgsky,
the English folk-song, "Oh No,
John," arranged by Cecil Sharp, and
"She Is Far from the Land," an old
Irish melody arranged by Stanford,
that the colored bass' mastery of
concert techniques was most clearly
seen. With volume and range that
is seldom heard in one but the
Wagnerian specialists, still he is ca
pable of expression and meaning that
makes for the most sympathetic
handling of anything he sings.
SPIRITUALS FEATURED
Among his 'encores, Robeson in
cluded the new "Ballad for Ameri
cans" by John Latouche and Earl
Robinson, "Water Boy," "Journey's
End," "Oh, Ma Baby" and "Scan
dalize Ma Name," an amusing negro
secular song.
His accompanist, Lawrence Brown,
who arranged most of the spirituals,
complemented and collaborated with
the gigantic negro singer on two of
the evening's offerings. "Joshua Fit
dc Battle of Jericho" and "Lil David,
