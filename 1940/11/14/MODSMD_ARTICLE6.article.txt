The social, economic and political
differences of China and Japan were
discussed by the Rev. Mr. Augustine

tional Church bqfore the Luncheon
Club yesterday.
Dr. Jones, speaking on the subject,
"South of Hong Kong," told of his
travels in Hawaii, Japan, China, In
dia, Australia, the Philippines, and
the Near East.
"China has never had any strong
concept of the nation," Dr. Jones
said, explaining the strong love of
family and ancestry in that coun
try. "It has been said that China is
a civilization, not a nation.'
NUMBER 105
He described the military loyalty
of Japan toward the emperor in
contrast with the Chinese feeling.
"Japan has never had a change of
dynasty," Dr. Jones remarked. "The
present emperor is number 165 of
the unbroken succession."
He told of the interest of Japan
in the Dutch possessions of the Far
East v rich in tin and rubber.
RUBBER EMBARGO
"If Japan should put an embargo
on rubber from the Malay Archi
pelago, it would go hard on our
rubber tire industry, until we could
develop the Central American in
dustry."
Dr. Jones illustrated his speech
with anecdotes about, his travels and
stories from the history and folk
lore of the countries he visited.
There will be no meeting of
Luncheon Club next week because
