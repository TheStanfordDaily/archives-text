W6ORITAJN sells oil to Japan."
"The United States fails to j
take adequate measures to combat \
the infiltration of foreign agents into J
the country."
The first of these statements is |
one that came over the press wires j
several days ago. The second is a
statement that has not yet appeared,
but it seems probable that some
thing resembling it will appear in
the press soon.
There is a certain parallel between
these two inconsistencies—both are
indications that a nation is aiding a
potential enemy.
From Java several days ago came
the report that the British-controlled
and operated oil companies in the |
Dutch East Indies had agreed to in- i
crease substantially their oil exports |
to Japan.
Since the start of Japan's drive
into the continent Great Britain
has officially supported China, but
meanwhile has contributed war |
materials to both nations. Now ;
when it seems that Japan may en- ;
ter into a war against Great Brit- !
ain, an English oil company de
cides to expand its trade with
Japan.

that the oil company
' in the East Indies is a private |
corporation, it is a peculiar govern- j
mental policy that permits aid to the j
Japanese war machine.
But the situation in the United
States has its parallel.
The United States is committed to
an all-aid-short-of-war policy to
Great Britain and thus is hardly
demonstrating friendship for the
Axis. The United States, in short,
has become a non-belligerent, sid
ing with Britain against Germany.
That the American people favor
aiding Britain is apparent, but evi
dently many Americans expect Ger
many to overlook this aid or at least
do nothing about it.
On the one hand we have taken
practical war steps, but on the other
we have done almost nothing to pro
tect ourselves against internal war
steps being taken against us.
And so we are incensed .at the
sabotage that becomes every day
more evident in our defense indus
tries, but we have not taken "war
steps" or even "steps-short-of-war"
to curtail activities of foreign agents
in this country.

The Federal Bureau of Investiga
tion is being expanded greatly, but !
this seems inadequate at the pres
ent; it seems much like the pro
verbial "shutting the door after the
horse has run away." The FBI may
track suspects for days, but the
chances are that nothing will be
done until after their work has been
done—after a plant has been blown
up.
While the FBI increases its per
sonnel. foreign governments in
crease their personnel. Evidence
this in the greatly expanded con
sular agencies of both Germany
and Italy in this country.

again, no steps have been
taken to curtail the Communist
and German-American Bund activ
ities—or their encouragement to the
saboteurs. Both of these groups are
committed to opposing defense
measures and have stated so
through ofTiical spokesmen.
While the British permit aid to
Japan, her "most" potential enemy;
ihe United States permits agents of
her "most" potential enemy to op
erate within her borders.
The parallel is not close, but there
is a parallel that America might well
consider. Perhaps these are the
weaknesses of democracy.
The British government in order
to halt the flow of oil to Japan must
extend its regulatory powers and
certain stockholders and tycoons in
London may be displeased.
The U.S. in order to curtail sabo
tage activities must perhaps restrict
certain groups, and take action
against the new consular agents in
a manner that will violate the best
American traditions of freedom to
all.
But these are steps a democracy
must take if it is to survive.
