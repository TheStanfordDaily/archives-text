# Stanford Man Perfects New Opinion Poll
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Calling elections these days isn't
a matter of concentrated prayer or
a couple of quick wishes on the
moon. It's an exact science involv
ing mathematics, questionnaires,
and hard, careful work.
There's no doubt about the busi
ness end of the thing, cither. No
body is laughing at Gallup. And in
a smaller way, using a local basis,
an ex-Stanford man is doing rather
well, too.
Dan E. Clark II came to Stanford !
last year from the University of
Oregon as a teaching fellow in the
Division of Journalism. The subject
of his roaster's thesis was public
opinion polls; unlike theses of the
"provisioning and equipment of the
Spanish armada" sort, this did more
than add an M.A. to its author's
name. It provided him with a thriv
ing businesss.
The method used was developed
by Clark and Dr. Chilton R. Bush
of the Division of Journalism. It is
designed for polling public opinion
in local areas, and involves taking
samples from a proportional cross
section of the various income groups.
Last fall. Clark called the Ham
and Eggs election in Redwood City
within .8 percentage points of the
actual vote. Using this as a proof
of the polls' efficacy, he sold the
: idea to four city newspapers.
The national election, naturally,
i was the crucial test for Clark's
j polls. They came through with
) flying colors. In the four cities the
I results were within 2.3 percentage
points of the actual vote —in Phila-
delphia, an error of 2.3 percentage
points; in Pittsburgh, an error of
1.8; in Portland, an error of 2.2;
and in San Francisco an error of
only .03 percentage points.
The election was the most spec
tacular event covered by the var
ious polls, because it was the real
check on validity. Their real.pur
pose is to furnish the papers in
Which they appear with accurate
public opinion on local questions,
such as the draft, civic problems,
city elections, and bond issues.
A story appears in each newspaper
once a week. In these, the results
of some matter of local interest are
published and discussed. Clark
hires interviewers in each city, shut
tling back and forth across the
country via plane to keep a check on
his interests.
Despite his Stanford connections
and the fact that the main office is
located in Los Altos, most of his
San Francisco interviewers are Uni
versity of California women. He
says they come from Cal because
it's easier for them to get to ihe
City during the week. No disloy
alty intended.

Dan E. Clark II came to Stanford !
last year from the University of
Oregon as a teaching fellow in the
Division of Journalism. The subject
of his roaster's thesis was public
opinion polls; unlike theses of the
"provisioning and equipment of the
Spanish armada" sort, this did more
than add an M.A. to its author's
name. It provided him with a thriv
ing businesss.
The method used was developed
by Clark and Dr. Chilton R. Bush
of the Division of Journalism. It is
designed for polling public opinion
in local areas, and involves taking
samples from a proportional cross
section of the various income groups.
Last fall. Clark called the Ham
and Eggs election in Redwood City
within .8 percentage points of the
actual vote. Using this as a proof
of the polls' efficacy, he sold the
: idea to four city newspapers.
The national election, naturally,
i was the crucial test for Clark's
j polls. They came through with
) flying colors. In the four cities the
I results were within 2.3 percentage
points of the actual vote —in Phila-
delphia, an error of 2.3 percentage
points; in Pittsburgh, an error of
1.8; in Portland, an error of 2.2;
and in San Francisco an error of
only .03 percentage points.
The election was the most spec
tacular event covered by the var
ious polls, because it was the real
check on validity. Their real.pur
pose is to furnish the papers in
Which they appear with accurate
public opinion on local questions,
such as the draft, civic problems,
city elections, and bond issues.
A story appears in each newspaper
once a week. In these, the results
of some matter of local interest are
published and discussed. Clark
hires interviewers in each city, shut
tling back and forth across the
country via plane to keep a check on
his interests.
Despite his Stanford connections
and the fact that the main office is
located in Los Altos, most of his
San Francisco interviewers are Uni
versity of California women. He
says they come from Cal because
it's easier for them to get to ihe
City during the week. No disloy
alty intended.

Calling elections these days isn't
a matter of concentrated prayer or
