# Kennedy Stops At Farm, Flies To See Hearst
## U.S. Ambassador Visits Son John; Travels to Wyntoon 
### 
Joseph P. Kennedy, U.S. ambas
sador to England, yesterday visited
his son John at Stanford and flew
north to Wyntoon, palatial moun
tain home of Publisher William
Randolph Hearst.
Kennedy, who said he was travel
ing and speaking only as a private
citizen, said he had no future plans
"except to do all I can to keep the
United States out of war."
APPEASEiVTKNT STAND
Asked about his stand on appease
ment of the totalitarian powers,
Kennedy said:
"I have never had a good defini
tion of appeasement. The only pol
icy I am advocating is that America
stay out of the war. If that is ap
peasement, make the most of it."
The German air attack on England
has not seriously affected British
economy nor morale, Kennedy said.
He said he believed the official Brit
ish figures on casualties and dam
age arc "sustantially correct."
' "If California will just keep mak
ing airplanes as it has been doing,
neither Japan nor anyone else will
ever give the United States a min
ute's trouble."
! VISITS HEARST
Kennedy was emphatic in his
statement it would be disastrous
for the United States to enter a
war abroad.
"When somebody says 'Ltl'.-> go
to war,' I ask 'How are you going
to war and how arc you going to get
in? How could you land troops
3,000 miles away with submarines
and airplanes as active as they
are?'"
Kennedy took an airliner north to
Medford, Ore., then drove back
across the state line into California
to the Heai'st resort. He said he was
uncertain as to how long he would
stay at Wyntoon and did not discuss
his plans to confer with the pub
lisher.
