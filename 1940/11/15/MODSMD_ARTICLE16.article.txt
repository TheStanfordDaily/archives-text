# Weakened Card Eleven To Face Crucial Game With Standlee on Bench
## Underrated Beaver Team Expected To Provide Challenge to Favored Cardinal Squad in Battle Tomorrow 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Every game a crucial game seems to be the rule for Stanford's stream
lined footballers. And tomorrow's is no exception, for (he Cards, at their
lowest physical and mental pitch, go out to protect their unbeaten, untied
record against a vastly underrated Oregon State eleven.
The experts have picked Shaughnessy's quick-striking Indians and

their whirlwind offense to slop the
Beavers by the absurd odds of 2-1.
but you can't deny a team which,
like Oregon State, has gone through
seven tough games with only a tie
with U.S.C. in the heat of Los An
geles and an undeserved three
touchdown loss to Washington.
RESERVE STRENGTH
A more important reason to fear
Oregon State than their seasonal rec
ord to date is the fact that they
have everything a good ball club re
quires. Sure to be a decisive factor

in Saturday's game between two
teams which have played bruising
football for seven straight week
ends is reserve strength, and the
Beaver's Coach Lon Stlner has
come up in the past few week
ends with a second string almost
equal to his first unit.
But the Beavers' threatening
strength doesn't end here. They
have a handful of scooter type
backs, light and fast, who can pass
and punt, as well as run up yard
age, in Bob Olsen, Gene Gray, Don
Durdan and Bob Dethem. First
stringer Olsen, however, is listed
a doubtful starter for tomorrow's
tilt.
PASS THREAT
Durdan raised havoc against
Washington State, beating the Cou
gars almost single-handed. He
passed to two touchdowns, set \ip
the third on another pass and scored
it himself. Against Cal it was Deth
em and Gray who did the ditty
work, for the pass combination of
Dethem to Gray scored the first
and the third decisive touchdowns.
The highly regarded fullback, Jim
Kisselburgh, mans the power guns
for yardage down the middle; and he
is ably backed up by Kenny Dow,
who has been elected captain for
the Beavers. Gene Peters at quar
terbeck handles the blocking assign
ments and the important job of
calling signals. Behind Betel's is
John Sommerville and filling in at
halfback is Joe Tomich.
Add to this versatile baekfield a
line that averages 200 pounds and
you see why Oregon State has a
fine chance of blocking the Indians'
path to the Rose Bowl. Stand-outs
in the line arc Johnny Leovich, a
rangy pass-catching end, Vic Sears,
mentioned on many All-Coast, teams
last year at tackle, and the veteran
Len Younce at guard.
STANDI,EE TO BE MISSED
Bui if Oregon State is to break
I the Cards' string of victories, it
j won't be as much because of the
j strength of the northerners as bc
\ cause of the weakened conditions of
I the Indians.
Shaughncssy's men are going to
j miss a guy named Norm Stand lee
jan awful lot tomorrow. Gone will
be the throat of power down the
middle to mix up with the brilliant j
aerial attack and striking end
sweeps, with Standlee on the j
bench.
Tomorrow the Cards will be a ,
team that has taken a terrific beat
ing during their past seven weeks ;
of success and one which wasn't able
to do any contact work whatsoever
this week for fear of injuries.
INDIAN INJURIES
Pete Kmetovic will be nursing a I
bad hip pointer but will be able to
\>lay. Vic Lindskog, the busy cen
ter. is .still bothered by an injured
hand. Stan Graff, captain and
starting end, got a bad cramp Wed
nesday which he hopes to have
worked out by game time tomorrow.
Shaughnessy's big problems this
week have been mainly defense and
the working in of Milt Vucinich at
the first-string fullback spot.
"Voose," who had to perform 55
minutes against Washington, did
quite well considering the shoes he
had to til! and his inexperience. Be
hind Vucinich will be the newly
promoted Rod Parker and Bob
Crane.
With Standlee gone, the burden
of carrying the power down the
middle will fall, as it did last Satur
day, mainly on Hugh "Duke" Gal
larneau. Last week Hugh carried 25
times and will probably be almost as
busy tomorrow mixing his punch
between the tackles with his speed
around the ends.
