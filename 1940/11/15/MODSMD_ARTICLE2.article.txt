# Greek Push Forces Italy To Retreat
## Italian Army Caught In Mountain Passes; At Mercy of Hellenes 
### 
ATHENS, Nov. 14 (UP). — The
Greek army launched a heavy of
fensive along the 120-mile front
from the lonian Sea to the Jugoslav
border today, slaughtering retreating
Italian columns taught in narrow
mountain passes.
Greek Evzones, mountain fighters,
cavalry and infantry fell on the
Italians at dawn. The attack was
supported by mountain artillery,
tanks and Greek and British planes
which planted bombs "like potatoes"
among the Italians.
Within three hours after the big
offensive started, front dispatches
reported these results:
1. The Italian southern wing
had been thrown back across the
Kalamas River at several points.
2. In the Kalpaki sector in the
center, the gateway to Janina,
Italians were driven from their
first line defenses and were being
pursued by Greek cavalry.
3. In the hard-fought northern
sector, Greek heavy guns on a high
plateau opened a murderous fire on
Italian positions on the Koritza-
Konitza Road. Answering an Italian
SOS, 400 trucks of reinforcements
were dispatched by Gen. Übaldo
Soddu. Italian commander-in-chief.
The caravan was demolished by Al
lied bombers.
The attacking Greeks shouted
their battle-cry of "Acra." a trans
lation of which would be: "Get
the hell out of here."
Heavy fighting was reported from
the Pindus mountains to the south
all the way to the Jugoslav frontier.
Late dispatches reported the Italians
driven from fortified positions on
important 4,500-foot mountains after
three hours of fierce fighting. Ital
ian fortified positions in Smolika
and Voiusa ravines were stormed.
