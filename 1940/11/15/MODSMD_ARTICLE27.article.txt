RERUN. Friday, Nov. 15 (UP). â€”Berlin had one of its most spectacu
lar aerial dispiays last night when British bombers raided the German
capital and. according to Nazi spokesmen, lost four planes.
Anti-aircralt guns and searchlights Mazed away as several of the
raiders hroke through the capital's outer defenses and came in over the

heart of the city. (
A Nazi spokesman said in addi
tion to the planes shot down over
Beilin, three other British planes
were brought down during the
night's operations over Germany.
The air raid alarm, which sent
Berliners scurrying to shelters as
searchlight beams pierced the heav
ens and anti-aircraft guns began
thundering, ended early today.
Of the four British planes reported
downed over Berlin, three Were
above the city proper and the fourth
was over a suburb, informants said.
Four British airmen were reported
captured .
Searchlights picked up one of the
raiders and held it in their beams
for five minutes while defense guns
pounded away at it, the Nazis said.
Anti-aircraft batteries and ma
chine guns turned a blistering fire
on the plane, which finally was hit
and set on fire.
"It hurtled down like a comet,"
the spokesman said, and crashed in
Ihe south part of Berlin.
One member of the crew who
escaped by parachute was spot
lighted until he hit the earth and
was caotured.
