## 
### 
Art McCue and his orchestra will
play * their seventh straight Ram's
Head engagement on Friday, No
vember 20, when McCue takes up
his baton to direct the score of the
1940 Big Game Gaieties.
Signing of the ex-Stanford man's
orchestra was announced yesterday
by Harry Muheim, Gaieties director.
There are 18 pieces in the group,
the largest number in its history.
A member of Ram's Head, McCue
has been playing for the Gaieties
and the Spring Show since 1938.
Orchestrations this year are being
handled by Hal Moreno, musical
director. He held the same post for
last year's "I'm a St rangier Here
Myself," and assisted Myron Birn
baum on the 1939 Gaieties.
It is planned to use mUsic as an
integral part of several of the skits.
According to Muheim, "Moreno has
a feeling he's going to go hog wild
in a couple of numbers."
Pete Wangenhcim, technical di
rector, asked that all members of
the stage crew report to the Memo
rial Hall shop this afternoon, to
night, tomorrow morning, and to
morrow night. "I want to sec the
game too," he said, "so we're tak
ing Saturday afternoon off."
