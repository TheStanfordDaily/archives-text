BERLIN, Nov. 11 (UP>. —Nazi political quarters tonight said Soviet i
Premier V. M. Molotov's conferences here with Chancellor Adolf Hitler
had "renewed and deepened German-Russian friendly relations."
Molotov left for home today after two days of long talks with Hitler
and other high German oflicials, leaving behind him the greatest diplo-

malic mystery of the times.
All aspects of the German-Russian
discussions—carried on not only by
Molotov but by 65 Russian oflicials
and industrialists he brought with
him—remained shrouded in utmost
secrecy.
Nazi political quarters said "Ger
many regards the policy commenced
with the non-aggression pact of last
year as a firm and lasting basis for
collaboration which has been of ad
vantage to both powers and must
therefore be further extended."
They added the Berlin talks
showed Russia shares this view.
The laconic communique after the
conferences ended said:
"During his presence in Berlin
the 12th and 13th of November this
year, V. M. Molotov, chairman of
the Soviet of People's Commissars
and Foreign Minister of the Soviet
Union, had a conference with the
Fuehrer and Reichminister of For
eign Affairs von Ribbentrop. An
exchange of opinions occurred in an
atmosphere of mutual trust and led
to agreement on all important ques
tions of interest to Germany and the
Soviet Union."
