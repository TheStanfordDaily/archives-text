# Balkan Drive Looms in East

By United Press

A bold stroke by Germany in
Southeastern Europe seems indi
cated as the next major phase of the
war. Fac.orii considered pointing in
this direction include:
1. The frank statement by author
ized German quarters that Ger
many's No. 1 job is to smash Britain
and that the "center of gravity of
this struggle has moved to the
southeast."
2. Russian Premier Molotov's im
portant conversations in Berlin,
which.-'terminated quickly and ap
parently to Germany's satisfaction.
Soviet interests in Southeastern Eu
x-ope, of vital importance in Moscow,
must be considered by Germany.
3. Rumanian Premier Antonescu's
visit to Rome, where the Rumanian
leader was reported to have agreed
to supply oil to Italy's war machine
and increase the flow of raw mate
rials to both Axis powers. Anto
nescu also ordered demobilization
of Rumanian armed forces, putting
the country completely under Ger
man domination.
4. The inability of Italy, Ger
many's Axis partner, to knock the
British out of Egypt and Palestine,
the Italian fiasco in Greece and the
heavy blow struck the Italian bat
tle fleet by Britain at Taranto. It
becomes increasingly obvious that
if Britain is to be dislodged from
the eastern Mediterranean, Ger
many must do it.
3. The long inactivity of Ger
many's vast land forces, which have
done virtually nothing since the
collapse of France. The defense of
the British Isles by thq Royal Air
Force forced Germany to lay aside
plans to invade England. The bulk
of this huge army is believed to have
been returned to southern Germany,
Slovakia and Rumania—where it is
in position to strike through the
Balkans.
It is generally believed lack of
an understanding by Germany of
her position in Rumania to strike
toward Britain's rich oil supplies in
Iraq and toward Egypt and the
Suez Canal, vital bottleneck in Brit
ish Empire communications. It ap
pears that this understanding may
now have been reached.
Some quarters believe Russia's
contribution may be far more than
mere permission for an Axis adven
ture down her flank.

been returned to southern Germany,
Slovakia and Rumania—where it is
in position to strike through the
Balkans.
It is generally believed lack of
an understanding by Germany of
her position in Rumania to strike
toward Britain's rich oil supplies in
Iraq and toward Egypt and the
Suez Canal, vital bottleneck in Brit
ish Empire communications. It ap
pears that this understanding may
now have been reached.
Some quarters believe Russia's
contribution may be far more than
mere permission for an Axis adven
ture down her flank.

A bold stroke by Germany in
Southeastern Europe seems indi
cated as the next major phase of the
war. Fac.orii considered pointing in
this direction include:
1. The frank statement by author
ized German quarters that Ger
many's No. 1 job is to smash Britain
and that the "center of gravity of
this struggle has moved to the
southeast."
2. Russian Premier Molotov's im
portant conversations in Berlin,
which.-'terminated quickly and ap
parently to Germany's satisfaction.
Soviet interests in Southeastern Eu
x-ope, of vital importance in Moscow,
must be considered by Germany.
3. Rumanian Premier Antonescu's
visit to Rome, where the Rumanian
leader was reported to have agreed
to supply oil to Italy's war machine
and increase the flow of raw mate
rials to both Axis powers. Anto
nescu also ordered demobilization
of Rumanian armed forces, putting
the country completely under Ger
man domination.
4. The inability of Italy, Ger
many's Axis partner, to knock the
British out of Egypt and Palestine,
the Italian fiasco in Greece and the
heavy blow struck the Italian bat
tle fleet by Britain at Taranto. It
becomes increasingly obvious that
if Britain is to be dislodged from
the eastern Mediterranean, Ger
many must do it.
3. The long inactivity of Ger
many's vast land forces, which have
done virtually nothing since the
collapse of France. The defense of
the British Isles by thq Royal Air
Force forced Germany to lay aside
plans to invade England. The bulk
of this huge army is believed to have
been returned to southern Germany,
Slovakia and Rumania—where it is
in position to strike through the
Balkans.
