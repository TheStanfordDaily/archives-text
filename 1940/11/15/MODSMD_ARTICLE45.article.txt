# Paly Light Opera Group Scores Hit with 'lolanthe'
## 
### 
To the gay, zestful melodies of
Gilbert and Sullivan, the Palo Alto
Light Opera Association presented
its annual fall operetta, "lolanthe,
or the Peer and the Peri." Super
vised by Ralph Emerson Welles, and
under the musical direction of El
wyn Bugge, the action and music
were co-ordinated into a colorful
show, lovely to look at and lovely
to hear.
Costumed by Chrysella Kiler and
framed most beautifully in sets by
Carroll Alexander, a company of 40
people sang and acted the biting
satire of England's masters of light
opera, who concentrated their ef
forts on Parliament in this particu
lar opera.
The voices of the romantic leads,
Carl Uppman and Mildred Keeney,
blended perfectly and both were
rich and lyrical in their solo pas
sages.
The famous role of the Lord Chan
cellor was played, all too well, by
Francis Seago. His "nightmare"
song was a highlight.
Keith Allen, a Stanford student,
as Private Willis added to Ihe gen
eral comedy and was a perfect foil
for the Fairy Queen, Louise Plun
kett, whose remarkable contralto
voice was a definite addition to the
musical side of the evening.
Marjorie Benson, in the title role,
displayed an extremely flexible
voice. Philip T. McLean and Leonid

Bryner, as the two Earls who sought
the hand of the heroine, pompously
| strutted their way through their
ndiculous roles.
Great praise is due the chorus and
j its trainer. Never did the voices
i become too individual; they blended,
producing a smooth, harmonious in
j terpretation of their numbers.
If you are of the "Gilbert-and-
I Sullivan - are - the - greatest -
products-ol'-England" school, then
( you can't afford to stay away from
j the Palo Alto Community Theater
, tonight, tomorrow night, or Monday
I night.—Sprager.
