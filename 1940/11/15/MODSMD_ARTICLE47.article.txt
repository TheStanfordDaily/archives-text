### 
Stanford will send eight debaters
south to Pepperdine College in Los
Angeles this week-end to participate
in a three-day Western Speech In
vitational Forensic Touranment on
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
Two freshmen, Allan Armer and
Howard Leeden, and six varsity
debaters yet to be chosen will at

The national debate question this
year at all American universities is
"Resolved: That a permanent union
or treaty should be established
among the states of the Western
Hemisphere." Each team will be
prepared to debate either the af
firmative or negative.
Pepperdine has scheduled seven
events for the affair. They are as
follows: debate, ex tempore, oratory,
impromptu, after-dinner speaking,
progression debate, and conferences
for both coaches and students.
Varsity debaters from Stanford
will take part in the debate, ex tem
pore, impromptu, and progression
debate; the freshmen will partici
pate in debate and ex tempore. Four
divisions of each event have also
been planned. They are men's var
sity, women's varsity, men's lower
division, and women's lower divi
sion.
