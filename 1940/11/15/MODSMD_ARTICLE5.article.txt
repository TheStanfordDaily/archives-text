### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Nov. 14 (UP).
■—The San Francisco Board of Su
pervisors today discovered it had
inadvertently repealed ordinances
against downtown parking during
rush hours and all parking on Mar
ket Street.
The situation arose with the adop
tion of a new city-wide traffic
code which failed to restore all of
the old provisions. The supervisors
will consider the case at next Mon
day's meeling.
