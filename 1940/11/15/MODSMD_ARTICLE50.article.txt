Officers and directors of the Holly
wood Park Race Track and the Los j
Angeles Turf Club, which operates j
the Santa Anita Race Course, were j
ordered today by the State Horse I
Racing Board to appear before the j
board in connection with Gov. Cul- j
bert Olson's charge that both tracks ]
had "reneged" in paying the state 1
$'500,000 taken on charity racing j
days.
Chairman Jerry Giesler, of Ihe I
State Racing Board, told the ofTi- |
cials to appear, with their bookkeep- i
ing records, before the board Mon
day, Nov. 25.
Giesler's order was the latest de- j
velopment in the controversy opened !
by Governor Olson when, in a letter i
to the racing board, he charged that I
the two clubs had failed to pay the |
state treasury profits which had as
sertedly been promised the state j
from charity racing days.
