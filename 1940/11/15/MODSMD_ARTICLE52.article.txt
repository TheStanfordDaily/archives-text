seniors will take part in
their last game in Stanford Sta
dium when the Indians play host to
the Orangemen of Oregon State Col
lege tomorrow. Only two are regu
lars, the rest may not even see
much action in the last game on
their home field.
Right halfback Hugh Gallarneau
and left end Stan Graff are the regu
lars who will be playing their last
game on the Farm turf. Both have
played fine ball in their last sea
son, and deserve more credit than
either or both combined are likely
to get for their part in Stanford's
gridiron success this year. Graff
will lead the team as acting captain
tomorrow.
Other seniors, most of who will
probably see little or no action
against the Beavers, are halfback
John Casey, guard Chick Orme,
quarter Thor Peterson, full Bob
Templeton, and center Jim Verdieck.
They're all good football players,
and any one of them might have
been a star if they'd played regu
larly, but there just happened to be
one or two better men in front of
them most of the time.
Thor Peterson and Jim Ver
dieck are the hard luck kids of
the bunch. Peterson was slated to
move in ahead of Frankie Albert
before the season started, hut tore
loose a couple of ribs in scrim
mage and never had a real chance
to show what he could do.
Verdieck was the defensive star of
last year's ill-fated Indian eleven,
but found three men in front of
him all this year. Vic Lindskog
transferred in to take the starting
center job, and juniors Doug Stahle
and Colin McClintock improved
enough to move into the second and
third string positions.

they're trying to make us
believe that the Oregon State
Beavers will give Clark Shaugh
nessy's team its toughest game to
date. It's a little bard to swallow
that yarn week after week, but
the catch is that they could very
well be right. *
The Beavers are comparatively
fresh, they caught W.S.C. in the
mud up north last week and plas
tered a pretty bad defeat on them.
The same day the Indians had to
go all out to beat a very tough and
rugged Washington squad. So Stan
ford will send out a team tired from
a helluva tough slate of seven
games, while Lon Stiner's club is
definitely on the up-grade.
The northerners will show up
with a well rounded team. They're
very tough defensively and have a
good, varied offense. Jim Kissel
burgh furnishes the power, a couple
of sprinting halfbacks the speed.
They have good kicking and passing.
Throw in the fact that the In
dians' most powerful ground threat,
Norm Standlee, will be gathering
splinters on the bench and you have
a pretty good argument for an
O.S.C. win.
But it'll take more than that to
convince people around this neck
of the woods that the Beavers
will come out on top. The gam
blers reflected the feeling quite
well when they made the Indians
2-1 choices in the betting. Even
without the Chief, they don't think
the Shaughnessymen arc going to
be beaten.
Neither do I. There's no doubt
that it'll be a tough, and probably a
close, ball game, but I expect to see
more points on the Stanford side of
the scoreboard than on the O.S.C.
side when the game ends tomorrow
afternoon.
While sticking my neck out in this
fashion, I might as well dispense a
few more predictions of very ques
tionable validity. The first is that
Milt Vucinich will do a whale of a
job of filling in for Standlee and tear
off some good gains through the
Beaver forwards.
The second is that Hugh Gallar
neau will top both teams in the aver
age-yards-per-try department. The
third i» that it will once again be the
left arm of Frankie Albert that will
play the largest part in bringing the
Indians their eighth victory.

Other seniors, most of who will
probably see little or no action
against the Beavers, are halfback
John Casey, guard Chick Orme,
quarter Thor Peterson, full Bob
Templeton, and center Jim Verdieck.
They're all good football players,
and any one of them might have
been a star if they'd played regu
larly, but there just happened to be
one or two better men in front of
them most of the time.
Thor Peterson and Jim Ver
dieck are the hard luck kids of
the bunch. Peterson was slated to
move in ahead of Frankie Albert
before the season started, hut tore
loose a couple of ribs in scrim
mage and never had a real chance
to show what he could do.
Verdieck was the defensive star of
last year's ill-fated Indian eleven,
but found three men in front of
him all this year. Vic Lindskog
transferred in to take the starting
center job, and juniors Doug Stahle
and Colin McClintock improved
enough to move into the second and
third string positions.

they're trying to make us
believe that the Oregon State
Beavers will give Clark Shaugh
nessy's team its toughest game to
date. It's a little bard to swallow
that yarn week after week, but
the catch is that they could very
well be right. *
The Beavers are comparatively
fresh, they caught W.S.C. in the
mud up north last week and plas
tered a pretty bad defeat on them.
The same day the Indians had to
go all out to beat a very tough and
rugged Washington squad. So Stan
ford will send out a team tired from
a helluva tough slate of seven
games, while Lon Stiner's club is
definitely on the up-grade.
The northerners will show up
with a well rounded team. They're
very tough defensively and have a
good, varied offense. Jim Kissel
burgh furnishes the power, a couple
of sprinting halfbacks the speed.
They have good kicking and passing.
Throw in the fact that the In
dians' most powerful ground threat,
Norm Standlee, will be gathering
splinters on the bench and you have
a pretty good argument for an
O.S.C. win.
But it'll take more than that to
convince people around this neck
of the woods that the Beavers
will come out on top. The gam
blers reflected the feeling quite
well when they made the Indians
2-1 choices in the betting. Even
without the Chief, they don't think
the Shaughnessymen arc going to
be beaten.
Neither do I. There's no doubt
that it'll be a tough, and probably a
close, ball game, but I expect to see
more points on the Stanford side of
the scoreboard than on the O.S.C.
side when the game ends tomorrow
afternoon.
While sticking my neck out in this
fashion, I might as well dispense a
few more predictions of very ques
tionable validity. The first is that
Milt Vucinich will do a whale of a
job of filling in for Standlee and tear
off some good gains through the
Beaver forwards.
The second is that Hugh Gallar
neau will top both teams in the aver
age-yards-per-try department. The
third i» that it will once again be the
left arm of Frankie Albert that will
play the largest part in bringing the
Indians their eighth victory.

seniors will take part in
their last game in Stanford Sta
dium when the Indians play host to
the Orangemen of Oregon State Col
lege tomorrow. Only two are regu
lars, the rest may not even see
much action in the last game on
their home field.
Right halfback Hugh Gallarneau
and left end Stan Graff are the regu
lars who will be playing their last
game on the Farm turf. Both have
played fine ball in their last sea
son, and deserve more credit than
either or both combined are likely
to get for their part in Stanford's
gridiron success this year. Graff
will lead the team as acting captain
tomorrow.
