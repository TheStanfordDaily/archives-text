j reserves.

closer than it looks.

; comes back.
Texas over Texas Christian — but
i anything can happen here.
Stanford over Oregon State—ln
! idans step into Rose Bowl.
Michigan over Northwestern —
Harmon and Co. bounce back.
Indiana over Wisconsin — more
i scoring punch.
Oklahoma over Missouri—after a
close, hard fight.
