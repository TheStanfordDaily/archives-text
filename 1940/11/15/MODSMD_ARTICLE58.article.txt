# Buggemen Prepare For Meet with Cal
## 
### 
Coach Elwyn Bugge is putting his
charges through vigorous practice
sessions these days in preparation
for the Indian-Bear struggle slated
for November 29 at Berkeley.
The Buggemen have shown plenty
of class so far this season, having a
.750 average for the year. Bugge's
outfit took the Bears' measure last
year, and if this season's victories
mean anything, it should be ;i re
peater for the Cards.
