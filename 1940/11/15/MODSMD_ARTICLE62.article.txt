with Menlo Junior College, ended in
a 1-1 tie. It. was the first soccer
game for a lot of the players and
the fledgling kickers showed re
markable promise.
Pescadero High School eked out a
1-0 victory in the last quarter of
play of the second game. Both
teams played good soccer, and the
i'ro.sh seemed vastly improved over
their first encounter. Despite the
fact that th Papoose kickers were
in '"Pesky's" territory most of the
time, they failed to have the neces
sary punch and the visitors scored
on a fast break-away play.
There have been no games since
the Pescadero encounter but Coach
Tevfik Sadullah has been concen
trating on fundamentals. Numerous
scrimmages have been held and
usually once a week with Harry
Maioiley's varsity reserves.
