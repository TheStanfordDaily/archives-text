# Gallagher Heads Cub Front Office
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Nov. 14 (UP). â€” Jim
Gallagher, veteran Chicago baseball
writer, today was named general
manager of the Chicago Cubs in an
other move by owner Phil K. Wrig
ley to end the confusion in the
front office of his National League
baseball club.
Gallagher's appointment was as
much of a surprise as the sudden
release yesterday of Charles Leo
(Gabby) Hartnett, who had man
aged the Cubs since July, 1938.
First task to greet Gallagher when
he takes over his new job Monday
is hiring a manager to replace Hart
nett. Leading candidates so far ap
parently are Jimmy Wilson of the
Cincinnati Reds and Bill Meyer ol'
the Kansas City Blues, although
Wrigley insists he has contacted
neither.
