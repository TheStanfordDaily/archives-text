# Indians to Tangle With Ucla Booters
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity soccer team, I
fresh from a narrow win over the !
San Mateo Bulldogs, will meet the
U.C.L.A. Bruins tomorrow at 1:30
o'clock on the local field. In the
first meeting of the teams earlier [
in the season, the Indians managed i
to eke out a 4-3.
Coach Harry Maloney wasn't |
overly pleased with the work of the ;
team San Mateo, especially I
the showing made by the second
stringers. But he thought that the j
first stringers showed "fire" by going j
in with the score 2-0 against them i
and coming out with a win.

In 189G the student body promoted
and managed successfully a Pader
ewski concert in San Jose and again
in 1008 one in the Assembly Hall.
