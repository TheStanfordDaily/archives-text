# Big Game Bonfire Returns To Lake Bed Site on Probation
## 
### HAL SHAFER 
Stanford once again will roast the lowly Golden Bear in Lagunita lake
bed at the annual Big Game bonfire this year, due to the signing of a
no-unnecessary-disturbance guarantee by Bruce Jessup. A.S.S.U. presi
dent, and Bob Breckner, bonfire chairman, with the Administration.
The tripartite agreement permits return of the bonfire to its tradi
tional site with the following

visos:
1. Bonfire collecting and building j
will not begin until 6 a.m., the day j
of the bonfire, Thursday, Nov. 28.
2. No unnecessary noise is to be j
made which will disturb the Row,
Roble or Lagunita before or after ;
the bonfire.
3. No disturbances inside Roble
will be tolerated, and guards will
probably be placed in the vicinity
to prevent such occurrences.
ROBLE HYSTERIA' RECALLED
The concludii\g stipulation re
calls disturbances and "Roble hys
teria" caused two years ago by bon
fire activities. It was these occur
rences which precipitated com
plaints from hall directors and ne
cesitated change in site of the bon
fire to the field south of Encina.
If this year's bonfire is carried out
according to student - administra
; tion agreements, the affair will be
| held in Lagunita lake bed in the
| future.
Stressing that this year's "pro
bationary" bonfire must be con
ducted according to the rules, Jes
sup stated:
"If we can conduct the bonfire
| this year in a reasonable way, its
permanent site at the Lake will be
! secured."
