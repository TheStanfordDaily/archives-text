THIS afternoon from 3 to 5:30 o'clock, the femi
nine half of the class of '44 will have its first
chance to examine a part of Stanford life that
has not before presented itself for attention.
Courtesy teas are a mild form of that virulent
disease, winter quarter rushing. As their title
implies, they are a courtesy only, signifying
nothing except that the Row women would
like to meet Susie Freshman and have Susie
Freshman meet them.
But they do offer Susie an opportunity to
look at life up the Row in an atmosphere which,
despite its hectic sociability, is comparatively
free from the feverish excitement of winter
rushing. Susie will be able to compare and con
trast the houses and what they have to offer
v/ith Lagunita and Union which she inspected
earlier in the fall. Probably it will be this after
noon too when the feminine half of '44 will
discover that the nine sororities on the campus
can only accommodate slightly more than a
third of the women enrolled, and inevitably
160 or more of her sister Robleites will not
pledge.
If Susie has been observant this fall she will
have discovered that Stanford doesn't distin
guish between Hall and Row women, and
ough sorority life is an integral part of the
nus, it is a way of life that is necessarily in
inority. Women who are prominent cam
'ures are prominent not because they are
Row, but are prominent because they
i contribution to make to Stanford,
er this week-end, the freshman women
realize that the main difference between
and Row is the size of the living groups.
■ lie Row, the houses permit knowing a small
ip of people exceedingly well, while in the
iiuas, there is the opportunity for a larger circle
of not quite such close friends. The other dif
ference she can find out from Miss Sims, the
director of Roble, any time this quarter.
That difference is living expenses. Miss Sims'
figures, which are from the Dean of Women's
office, estimate that tangible expenses average
about $10 per month more on the Row than in
the Halls. This figure is exclusive of initiation
fees, cost of pins, etc.
So, after this week-end, freshman women
will have seen both ways of life at Stanford
close-up, and will have a basis for their choice
as to how they plan to spend their next three
years when the question arises in winter quar
ter.—M. E. F.

If Susie has been observant this fall she will
have discovered that Stanford doesn't distin
guish between Hall and Row women, and
ough sorority life is an integral part of the
nus, it is a way of life that is necessarily in
inority. Women who are prominent cam
'ures are prominent not because they are
Row, but are prominent because they
i contribution to make to Stanford,
er this week-end, the freshman women
realize that the main difference between
and Row is the size of the living groups.
■ lie Row, the houses permit knowing a small
ip of people exceedingly well, while in the
iiuas, there is the opportunity for a larger circle
of not quite such close friends. The other dif
ference she can find out from Miss Sims, the
director of Roble, any time this quarter.
That difference is living expenses. Miss Sims'
figures, which are from the Dean of Women's
office, estimate that tangible expenses average
about $10 per month more on the Row than in
the Halls. This figure is exclusive of initiation
fees, cost of pins, etc.
So, after this week-end, freshman women
will have seen both ways of life at Stanford
close-up, and will have a basis for their choice
as to how they plan to spend their next three
years when the question arises in winter quar
ter.—M. E. F.
THIS afternoon from 3 to 5:30 o'clock, the femi
nine half of the class of '44 will have its first
chance to examine a part of Stanford life that
has not before presented itself for attention.
Courtesy teas are a mild form of that virulent
disease, winter quarter rushing. As their title
implies, they are a courtesy only, signifying
nothing except that the Row women would
like to meet Susie Freshman and have Susie
Freshman meet them.
But they do offer Susie an opportunity to
look at life up the Row in an atmosphere which,
despite its hectic sociability, is comparatively
free from the feverish excitement of winter
rushing. Susie will be able to compare and con
trast the houses and what they have to offer
v/ith Lagunita and Union which she inspected
earlier in the fall. Probably it will be this after
noon too when the feminine half of '44 will
discover that the nine sororities on the campus
can only accommodate slightly more than a
third of the women enrolled, and inevitably
160 or more of her sister Robleites will not
pledge.
