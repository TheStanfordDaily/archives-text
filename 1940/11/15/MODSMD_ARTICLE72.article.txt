# Hysteria Week

THE lake is the only place for the Big Game
Bonfire.
Those of us who crowded out of the Pavilion
and stumbled across the street to that vacant
lot near Toyon must have realized last Novem
ber that it just wasn't the correct spot.
The Bonfire didn't click.
Somehow, in comparing the location with
previous bonfires staged on the dry bed of
Lake Lagunita, last year's site suffered. It was
impossible for anyone to stand very near the
pyre. The crowd was disorganized and the yell
kings had difficulty gathering attention. The
spirit generated in the Pavilion trickled away
just as the throng itself streamed out, fan-like,
over the whole, wide area. The fire was fin
ished in a few minutes and everyone trotted
home, a little disappointed.
It is safe to say that the organization of last
year's Bonfire was not to blame. It had com
petent handling in every respect â€”committees
were efficient and plans were well mapped. It
was no great disaster, but it certainly left some
thing to be desired.
This year the fault that spiked the 1939 Bon
fire has been corrected. It is gratifying to Stan
ford to have student officials such as Anne
Townsend and Bruce lessup, both of whom
were acutely conscious of the shortcomings
of the location of last year's fire. It is a break
for the Farm as a whole that these representa
tives, through meetings with University offi
cials, who originally shifted the Bonfire to its
unpopular position, were able to bring it back
to the lake again.
It is now Stanford's duty to see that it stays
at the lake.
Everyone knows the yarn about Roble Hys
teria. The building of the Bonfire underneath
the windows of the frosh women's dorm proved
much too exciting a feature to compete with
mundane lectures and routine academic as
signments. Result hysteria. Or, as Webster
says, "a nervous affection, chiefly in women,
characterized by choking sensations, paroxysms

of laughter or weeping, and frequently simi
lating other diseases."
This sort of thing shouldn't go on, the Ad
ministration decided. So the Bonfire was shifted.
The set of rules that has been approved by
students in charge and the officials of the Uni
versity should eliminate any further objections.
If it is possible to insure the continuation of a
tradition by signing an agreement, that insur
ance will go into effect Big Game Week. Un
dergraduate Stanford must realize that, in this
trial year, it is treading a thin line. One step in
the wrong direction may cancel all gains.
So keep calm, women.
