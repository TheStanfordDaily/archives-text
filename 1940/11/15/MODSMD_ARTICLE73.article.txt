STILL MOKE NOTES FROM THE CUFF
IUST a few journalistic scrapings thrown together
to keep you wise on what's going on:

This month is positively the last day for seniors
to have their pictures taken for the Quad senior
page. Positively. Absolutely. Maybe.

Over 5000 ski enthusiasts turned out in San Fran
cisco Wednesday to attend the Examiner's Ski Show.
By some strange coincidence it was the largest turn
out this show has ever drawn and Paulette Goddard
was there. Yes siree; nothing like the wind and the
snow and skis and to stimulate a man.

JN AN indirect way, Stanford women yesterday were
paid an extremely glowing tribute. It came with
the news that beginning next semester the campus au
thorities at our hisster university in Berkeley are
going to ring an early curfew for freshman and sopho
more women.
Coeds (quote) must be in their homes by 7:30 p.m.
on week nights, and limit callers to the hours before
midnight (unquote). That, sounds bad; it's about time
they limited it to midnight.
The reason given—which presupposes that it IS
the reason—for this early closed-door policy is the
spectacular (that's Cal) downward surge of those
women's scholastic averages under the present rules
which allow women to stay out until 10:30 p.m., and
allow them to entertain visitors until 2 a.m.
That 10:30 business has a familiar ring. Mostly
because, except, on the nights when "good" girls get
lockouts, the Farm women are supposed to be in at
the same time.
Apparently, however, the Stanford women are bet
ter able to take care of themselves, scholastically speak
ing, after 7:30. And you can read that again. Even
with our 10:30 system, which the Cal women can't
stomach, there are very few Farmerettes who take
the scholastic low road which leads to home and
that big neighboring Swede farmer who wanted to
marry her all the time anyway.

rpHERE i s another angle to this student body card
deal. Under the regulations issued by the Stanford
Hospital for Stanford student visitors is the stipulation
that "the Information Clerk at the Hospital will issue
visiting permits to student visitors on the presenta
tion of student body cards. These permits will be
checked by the nurse in charge of the room or ward
and are to be exchanged for the student body card
as the visitor leaves the hospital."
"... but my mother is dying."
"Sorry. No student body card, no get in. What do
you think this is—the Washington game?"

Recently, on short notice, a Stanford woman wanted
to visit Dwight Hutchinson, the Daily editor, when
he was in the hospital with a cut foot.
So she put on bohbie socks, a shockingly short
skirt and told the Information Clerk that she was a
Paly High girl.
Thoy let her right in without a student body card
