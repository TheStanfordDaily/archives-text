## STUDENT BODY PRIVILEGES 
### 
yHE EDITOR, SIR:
I can't quite see any good reason for ihe detec
tive work on the part of the B.A.C. at last Saturday's
game. As has already been mentioned in this paper,
many students were detained at tlie gate while ljeing
put through a cross-examination, while others lost
their cards as a result of handing them to their friends
or crooks, as one person put it, when they themselves
were unable to go.
Now, what I am wondering is—why docs Stanford
have to be so careful about not letting anyone but
bona fide Stanford students in on a student-body card?
The fact that a student possesses a card means that
there should be a seat waiting for him in the stands.
Therefore there should be no question of lack of
seats for real students. If this student cannot use
his card, why shouldn't he let a friend use it if he so
desi res?
You might say that the school loses the money that
these persons would otherwise pay if they bought
tickets. How much would this amount to? Probably
less than 150 cards would be lent, which means a
loss of $225. if all these persons were to buy tickets.
But how many of these persons would or could buy
tickets if they did not have the use of a student-body
card. 1 Probably not more than a quarter of them,
which brings the loss to the college down to about
$57 —$5< out of (50,000 other paid admissions.
Can't we at Stanford afford to lose $57 to let a
few students pass on this student-body privilege if
they cannot use it?
