# INQUISITION?
## 
### 
'I'M IE EDITOR. SIR:
As an interested onlooker (having attended no
football game during the last five years at Stanford)
I should like to join Doughty and Raynes in denounc
ing the B.A.C. inquisition against transferring student
lxÂ»dy cards. Having, against his will, paid the required
$15 community fee, why should not the purchaser be
privileged to allow another student use of the card?
Are we to understand that the B.A.C. prefers vacant
bleachers rather than a large rooting section? Or*does
the B.A.C. fear the student body card will be used
by a Fifth-Columnist, or perhaps a rooter for the op
posing team? In brief, why and wherefore must the
inquisition continue?
