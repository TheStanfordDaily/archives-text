### 
The story of the invention and
development of the klystron by
members of the Stanford Depart
ment of Physics will be dramatized
over station KGO tonight at 8:30
o'clock.
This will be the second in a series
of programs entitled "Unlimited
Horizons." It is broadcast weekly
over a coast-to-coast hook-up, and
deals with recent developments in
' university research in the fields of
engineering and physics.
Stanford, the University of Cali
fornia, and the California Institute
of Technology are the three uni
versities participating in this new
j radio feature.
! The klystron is an ultra-short
! wave radio tube which has opened
I new fields in the ultra-high frc
j quency region. It was first applied
i to blind landings in aircraft, and
; has proved highly successful.
