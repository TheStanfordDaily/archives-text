jpAN - AMERICAN solidarity for
many years was little more than
a political phrase appearing in the
U. S. press.
Today, Pan-American solidarity
has passed the stage of exclusive
political usage and may even have
emerged from the stage of wish
thinking.
Although much credit is due the
Administration in Washington for
its efforts in behalf of mutual un
derstanding in the Western Hemis
phere, it may be said, with substan
tial evidence to back the case, that
the war in Europe has done more
toward closer relations among the
nations of North and South America
than any Administration in Wash
ington has ever done.
Several items in the news dur

trend of I>atin-American rela

equally significant, revealed that the
governments of Mexico and the
United States were negotiating a
mutual defense agreement.
Mexican politics have been beyond
the comprehension of Americans
for as many years as presidents or
dictators have held office in that
country. Mexican elections have
never been elections in so far as
Americans understand the word,
and Mexican presidents have
seemed to us like absolute rulers
of the dictator variety.
This year's election was as mysti
fying as any in the past with the
issues obscured by alleged "foreign
influence."

is known that he was supported by
those elements who stood by expro

fields below the Rio Grande. Amer

were not happy when Comacho's
election was announced.
But since Hitler has become mas

for better relations between the
United States and Mexico has eclips
