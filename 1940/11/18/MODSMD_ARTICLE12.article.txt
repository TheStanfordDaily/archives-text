# War in Winter To Be Subject Tuesday Night
## 
### 
A symposium on "Winter and
Waij" will be presented for the
Tuesday Evening Series tomorrow
night at 7:30 o'clock in Memorial
Hall.
Participating in the discussion
will be Merrill K. Bennett, profes
sor of economic geography; Philip
W. Buck, associate professor of po
litical science; and Joseph S. Davis,
professor of economic research.
In usual war discussions, military,
naval, and air movements are given
much attention. Tomorrow night
two other factors will particularly
concern the speakers: namely, that
Europe is now entering winter which
will extend for most of the countries
well into April and that the whole
problem of fuel and food is related
to winter.
Professor Bennett will discuss fac T
tors of economic geography including
climate and temperature. Professor
Buck will speak of the recent diplo
matic moves in Europe.
Resources in fuel, food, and fi
nances of the warring countries will
be discussed by Professor Davis. At
the end of the program there will
be an opportunity for the audience
to question the speakers.
