Harry Muheim, Gaieties director,
promises that the forthcoming show
will be elaborately staged, but that
spectacular sets will not be used at
a sacrifice of production speed.
Staging is in charge of Technical
Director Pete Wangenheim.
VARIED LOCALES
Locales for the various songs and
skits range from the Sahara desert
to Cell Block "B" in San Quentin.
The Sahara enters into some sort
of complicated rapprochement be
tween songster Brad Young and the
Foreign Legion. All Muheim will
say about the cell is that it's au
thentic. He refused to name his
technical consultant.
Mary Merner will sing from a sus
pansion bridge—guaranteed to be
more secure than the Tacoma Nar
rows structure. No reason can be
found for this set. "She just thought
it would be kind of nice to sing off
a bridge," Muheim stated.
F.D.R. VIES WITH KAPPAS
Your local draft board will vie
with a new and magnificent back
ground for President Roosevelt; and
a luxurious sorority (allegedly the
Kappa house) will furnish the back
ground for "The Man Who Came to
Sunday Night Supper on Friday
Night When They Weren't Serving
It."
A set termed "simple but huge"
is one consisting of a large adobe
wall. It goes with a song entitled
"Beside an Old Adobe Wall." Ac
cording to Muheim, "any logical per
son can figure that one out." The
opener and finale will involve some
sort of "screwball staging."
"I sure wish we could think of a
hot comment to make about these
sets," Muheim said yesterday, "but
they defy description — Wangen
heim says they even defy construc
tion."
