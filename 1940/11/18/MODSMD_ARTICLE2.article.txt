# Alumni Boom Willkie For Farm Head
## Name Not Mentioned As Wilbur Successor, Leland Cutler Claims 
### 
Prospects that Wendell L. Willkie
is being boomed for the presidency
of Stanford University to succeed
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur mush
roomed over the week - end, and
brought fortli comments from two
University trustees.
The San Francisco Call-Bulletin
reported Saturday, "The move has
passed well beyond the talking stage,
and interested alumni have met to
discuss means of securing the offer
and inducing Willkie to accept."
However, yesterday's Chronicle
apparently spiked the suggestion
with an official statement from Le-

land W. Cutler, chairman of the
board of trustees and member of a
joint trustees - faculty committee
which is considei'ing a possible
successor.
"Many names have been submit
ted for a successor to President Wil
bur but Willkie's name has never
been submitted or considered in
any way by the trustees. There's
absolutely nothing to it," Cutler
said.
Dr. Wilbur was to have retired
August 31, 1940, but was asked to
continue as president until Jan. 1,
1942, when Fiftieth Anniversary
celebrations of 1941 will terminate.
VERMONT OFFER
Circulation of the Willkie-for
president-of-Stanford rumor fol
lowed reports Friday from Vermont
that Willkie would be offered the
presidency of a university in that
state.
One alumnus, Alan Drury, former
Daily associate editor of Vol. 94 and
Bull-Sessioner, has circularized
campus living groups extensively in
an effort to promote Willkie for
the post.
Almon Roth, former Stanford
comptroller and currently a trustee
and head of the Employers' Council
of San Francisco, declared for the
Examiner he likewise had not heard
any mention of Willkie's name for
the post of president.
ROTH COMMENTS
"It is not such a bad idea," he is
reported to have said. "The New
Deal takes care of its people. We
could do worse for Mr. Willkie."
Roth, himself, had been mentioned
as a possible successor to Dr. Wil- :
bur.
C. V. Taylor, chairman of the Fac- j
ulty Advisory committee, said yes
terday that Willkie's name is. among
200 that have been submitted.- "If
an available candidate were men
tioned now, the successor to Dr. :
Wilbur might be named tomorrow," \
he said when asked when the com
mittee would name the new presi
dent.
Frank Walker, new comptroller I
and financial vice-president, de- |
clined to make a statement other ,
than, "I haven't heard anything be
yond what I've seen in the papers." !
Professor Edgar E. Robinson, head :
of the Committee on Public Exer
cises", also declined to comment.
According to the reports that
; the Stanford position would be of-
I fered to Willkie, the alumni spon
soring the plan may believe the
G.O.P. chieftain would be favorably
inclined because the post would
; permit him the freedom to remain
before the public as a writer and |
| speaker on political subjects.
It was pointed out that the Uni
-1 versity presidency, as in the case of
Woodrow Wilson when he was
president of Princeton, would pro- j
vide an excellent springboard for ;
the 1944 campaign, concerning '
which Willkie has remarked:
"Nineteen forty-four will take care i
! of itself."
