# CARDS 'BOWL' OVER O.S.C., 28-14
## Indians Cop Pasadena Bid in Last Half Spree Albert Handily Solves Tricky Oregon Defense 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Those startling Indians won their
eighth straight and Rose Bowl
clinching game last Saturday in their
usnal surprising and highly effective
fashion, submerging Oregon Stated
Beavers 28-14 with a flood of touch
downs in a breath-taking third
quarter.
Surprising because they ground
out all of their 14 first downs and
the fat total of 311 yards along tin
ground while their most powerful
and consistent ground gainer, Norm
Standlee, sat on the bench, the
Cards solved the unorthodox 4-3-3-1
defense of the northerners.
ONLY FOUR PASSES
Surprising because they attempted
only four passes, Coach Clark
Shaughnessy's Warriors rolled on
toward Pasadena, ignoring almost
entirely their heretofore favorite
and most successful offensive
weapon.
Frankie Albert, Stanford's Ail-
American of the day, used hi.s aerial
acrobatics only once to score when
he hurled a 39-yard pass in that
hectic third quarter to Hugh Gal
larneau, who danced into the end
zone.
Surprising too was the sensational
punting of this same Albert, who
kicked 6 times for an average of
50.6 yards, including one bad punt
which got out of hand and went out
of bounds after only 14 yards. Also
unexpected was the veteran way in
which Milt Vucinich took over
Standlee's job at fullback, espe
cially on the Cards' first quarter 71-
yard drive to score.
PARKER SURPRISES
But the most surprising of the
fullbacks was the almost unheard-of
Pod Parker, one of Shaughnessy's
hardest working reserves. His hours
of toil down on the third-string paid
off last Saturday as Rod swept the
Beaver right end from the 18-yard
line, cut back sharply, and squirted
into the end zone for six points.
The first four minutes of the game
were astonishing enough to the
Cardinal rooting section, fort.hey
saw their team waltz 71 yards on
nine plays following the opening
kick-off through the supposedly
powerful Beavers. Their team was
good but it, wasn't supposed to do
this to a team that had an expe
rienced line averaging over 200
pounds and a specially devised de
fense for stopping Shaughnessy's
now famous T-formation .
But there it. was, right in front of
them. Starting from their own 20,
the Cards first sent Ppte Kmetovic
through the middle for 5 yards, and
then Gallameau through the same
spot for 4 more. Vucinich, looking
an awful lot like Standlee, slashed
through tackle for 8 and a first
down on the 46.
GALLARNEAU GOES 2!Â»
Gallarneau crossed the orange and
black men up with the first of a
series of successful Indian end
sweeps, going 20 yards to the
Beaver 25. Vucinich hammered the
middle to the 20 and then Kmetovic
duplicated Gallarneau's trip only in
the opposite direction for 13 yards.
It was first down on the 7 and
things were going so easy. Gallar
neau moved it to the 2, Albert to
the 1, and then Vucinich poured over
tackle into the end zone; and the
Cards were away to a good start.
Albert made this conversion good,
as he did all his others during the
afternrton.
But the Beavers did have some
thing to back up all the pre-game
reports of their power. This some
thing was mainly their plunging
fullback, Jim Kisselburgh, who
made plenty of yardage through the
Reds' forward wall in the first half.
VARIED OFFENSE
Coach Lon Stiner's men mixed the
power of Kisselburgh, the flashy
running of their speedy halfbacks,
Bob Dethman and Don Durdan, and
climaxed it all with a brilliant pass,
Durdan to end Norm Peters, for 29
yards and the trying touchdown.
Maybe these Beavers were going
to be tough. But the third quarter
settled the issue. For after nine
minutes of the half had passed the
Cards had run up three more touch
downs in breath-taking suddenness
and had sewed up the ball game.
The Cardinals' awakening came
on a fourth down gamble by Albert.
It was fourth and 1 on the Beaver
40 and instead of punting, Frankie
called on "Duke" Gallameau to
plow through tackle for the precious
yard and an extra one for good
measure.
LATERAL CLICKS
On the very next play Albert lat
eraled out into the flat to Kmetovic,
who, aided by a sensational block
by Chuck Taylor, ripped all of the
38 yards into the end zone. There
was that Big Red Machine striking
as usual without warning and going
all the way on one play.
Almost immediately afterwards
Kmetovic recovered a Beaver fumble
on the Oregon State 33, and Albert
pitched his only successful pass of
the meager four he attempted.
Frankie found Gallarneau slipping
behind Durdan, the Beaver safety
man; and Hugh took the 39-yard
pass just as he moved into pay dirt.
Now desperate, the men from the
North started passing and their first
attempt was snared by Kmetovic on
Stanford's 39. From here the In
dians rolled the 61 yards to the goal
line on 7 quick thrusts. Gallarneau
started things by picking up 8 at
tackle; then Albert faded to pass but
ran instead for 13 big yards and a
first down.
PARKER SCORES
The startling Mr. Parker rammed
between end and tackle for 12 and
another first down on the 28. "Mid
get" A1 Cole snaked his way toward
and down the sidelines for 10 more
yards and another first down. Two
passes missed ' fire, and then
Parker barged through tackle and
the entire Beaver secondary for
those remaining 18 yards.
Oregon State's final score was the
lucky connection of a pass over the
heads of a bunch of over-anxious
Indian second and third stringers.
Yet. even though they were trailing
28-14, the Beavers managed to move
all of 67 yards on a prolonged march
in the fourth quarter only to be
denied by the stubborn Indian first
.striVig line on the Card 11.
