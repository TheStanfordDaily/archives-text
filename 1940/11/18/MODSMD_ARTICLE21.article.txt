# CARDS 'BOWL' OVER O.S.C., 28-14
## Indians Cop Pasadena Bid in Last Half Spree Albert Handily Solves Tricky Oregon Defense 
### CHUCK SMITH 
Those startling Indians won their
eighth straight and Rose Bowl
clinching game last Saturday in their
usnal surprising and highly effective
fashion, submerging Oregon Stated
Beavers 28-14 with a flood of touch
downs in a breath-taking third
quarter.
Surprising because they ground
out all of their 14 first downs and
the fat total of 311 yards along tin
ground while their most powerful
and consistent ground gainer, Norm
Standlee, sat on the bench, the
Cards solved the unorthodox 4-3-3-1
defense of the northerners.
ONLY FOUR PASSES
Surprising because they attempted
only four passes, Coach Clark
Shaughnessy's Warriors rolled on
toward Pasadena, ignoring almost
entirely their heretofore favorite
and most successful offensive
weapon.
Frankie Albert, Stanford's Ail-
American of the day, used hi.s aerial
acrobatics only once to score when
he hurled a 39-yard pass in that
hectic third quarter to Hugh Gal
larneau, who danced into the end
zone.
Surprising too was the sensational
punting of this same Albert, who
kicked 6 times for an average of
50.6 yards, including one bad punt
which got out of hand and went out
of bounds after only 14 yards. Also
unexpected was the veteran way in
which Milt Vucinich took over
Standlee's job at fullback, espe
cially on the Cards' first quarter 71-
yard drive to score.
PARKER SURPRISES
But the most surprising of the
fullbacks was the almost unheard-of
Pod Parker, one of Shaughnessy's
hardest working reserves. His hours
of toil down on the third-string paid
off last Saturday as Rod swept the
Beaver right end from the 18-yard
line, cut back sharply, and squirted
into the end zone for six points.
The first four minutes of the game
were astonishing enough to the
Cardinal rooting section, fort.hey
saw their team waltz 71 yards on
nine plays following the opening
kick-off through the supposedly
powerful Beavers. Their team was
good but it, wasn't supposed to do
this to a team that had an expe
rienced line averaging over 200
pounds and a specially devised de
fense for stopping Shaughnessy's
now famous T-formation .
But there it. was, right in front of
them. Starting from their own 20,
the Cards first sent Ppte Kmetovic
through the middle for 5 yards, and
then Gallameau through the same
spot for 4 more. Vucinich, looking
an awful lot like Standlee, slashed
through tackle for 8 and a first
down on the 46.
GALLARNEAU GOES 2!»
Gallarneau crossed the orange and
black men up with the first of a
series of successful Indian end
sweeps, going 20 yards to the
Beaver 25. Vucinich hammered the
middle to the 20 and then Kmetovic
duplicated Gallarneau's trip only in
the opposite direction for 13 yards.
It was first down on the 7 and
things were going so easy. Gallar
neau moved it to the 2, Albert to
the 1, and then Vucinich poured over
