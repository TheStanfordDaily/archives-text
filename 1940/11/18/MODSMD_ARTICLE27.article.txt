"The most important thing about a
man is what he treasures," said Dr.
D. Elton Trueblood in his sermon

What you are is determined by
what you value, Dr. Trueblood de
clared. Both men and nations go to
pieces when they worship lesser
things, he added.
Two of the things which are
overly-prized in modern civilization
are 'money and our lives, and two of
the things which are undervalued
are loving fellowship and the way
of life in which it is possible for men
to be free, he said.
"Let us at this Thanksgiving pe
riod be thankful for the right
things, and thankful that we still
have a pattern of life in which
those of the most enduring worth
are still treasured."
