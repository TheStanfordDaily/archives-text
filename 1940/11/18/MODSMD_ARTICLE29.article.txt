## 
### 
DOWNEY. Nov. 17 (UP). —Government pressure to effect a settlement
of the strike that has paralyzed the Vultee aircraft factory since Friday
increased tonight as Army Air Corps pilots from MoiTett Field passed
through C.1.0. picket lines and took delivery of 17 basic training planes.
Major Sidney Simpson of the War Department and Arnold To lies of
the National Defense Commission staff arrived today from Washington.

They immediately began conferences,
with Lyman Sisley and E. H. Fitz
gerald. local federal conciliators, ex
pected to a meeting of representa
tives of the company and the Auto
mobile Workers' Union.
OFFICIALS WILLING
Both Vultee and union officials
expressed willingness to attend the
proposed meeting, Tonight, how
ever, they issued supplementary
statements defending their posi
tions in the strike, arising chiefly
from a controversy over wages.
More than 5200 workers are idle as
the result of shutdown of the fac
tory, currently engaged in manufac
turing $80,000,000 worth oi military
aircraft for national defense.
Arriving by train from MofTett
Field, near San Francisco, the army
pilots drove through the picket lines
in a bus after two of them had ex
plained their identity to the striking
workmen. The pickets made no
demonstration. Only skeleton lines
were on picket duty because of
heavy rainfall.
ISSUE EXPLAINED
The company's official statement
released today described "the con
sequences of the untimely strike
against a vital unit of the national
defense program" as far-reaching.
Completion of present enlarge
ments of the factory will have ex
panded facilities 1100 per cent and
will provide continuous employ
ment for 10,000 men, the statement
said.
"This is the only issue in the
walkout," a union statement said.
"Vultee workers originally de
! manded 75 cents an hour, but dur
ing negotiations offered a compro
mise of G5. The workers agreed to
day to restate their demand at 75
since the strike was forced upon
them."
