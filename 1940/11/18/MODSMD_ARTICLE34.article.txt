# Broncos Rally To Beat Gaels
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 17 (UP).
â€”Santa Clara overcame an early St.
Mary's lead to crush the Gaels 19-7
today in a bitter football battle be
tween the traditional rivals before
40,000 fans in fog-shrouded Kezar
Stadium.
St. Mary's passed to a touchdown
in the first nine minutes of play, but
the Bowl-conscious Broncos, 2-1
favorites, came back with the tying
touchdown in the second period and
the winning scores in the third,
when the fog was so thick it was
difficult to distinguish the players
on the field.
Shortly after the game opened, St.
Mary's got the ball on the 50-yard
line after an exchange of punts and
halfback Ed Heffeman passed 38
yards to lanky Leroy Ruskusky who
ran to a touchdown. End Joe
Aguirre converted.
Bottled up in the first quarter by
guard George Zuky's accurate punts,
the Broncos roared back in the sec
ond period. With a minute and a
half to play in the opening half, half
back Kenny Casanega uncorked an
impromptu play which netted 52
yards and a touchdown. Casanega
skirted around right end, twisted
free from two tacklers and reached
the 13-yard line where he lateraled
to halfback Harry Sanders who car
ried the ball into the end zone.
