the Indians safely over their |
eighth hurdle of the season, and
a lead pipe cinch, barirng war and i
taxes, for the Rose Bowl nomination, i
we can all sit back and relax until j
the time comes to start worrying,
about the Big Game.
It's about time now for a million |
and one experts and sports writers !
to come up with the astounding j
news that they picked Stanford to '
wind up on top of the conference
I months before the season started.
: There'll be a lot of 'em that will
j suddenly discover that, while they
did not mention it at the time, they
had a pretty good idea all along
that the Cardinal team would be in
Pasadena on New Year's.
Just to be unique, this column
will admit that, though we're
| supposed to be the team's most
I frantic boosters at all times, we
j never suspected that they'd clean
up on all comers in such effective
fashion.
Before the U.S.F. game Lucky
Louie and yours truly would prob
ably have gladly settled for as many
wins as losses over the season. The
Big Game was about all we were
j pointing for.
Now we find that, everywhere but
; on the Farm, the attempt to regain '
; the Axe has become almost a sec
ondary issue, completely eclipsed by
the astounding record of what, God |
i help us, we'll have to call a Cin
derella team with a Cinderella j
j coach.

TN A WAY, it's almost too bad
, that the Indians have been such ;
: a sensation this year. The un
-1 usual success, and the attending
publicity, is likely to make it tough
' on Clark Shaughnessy in the
years to come.
Granted that he's a great coach,
possibly the greatest in the coun
try, and a very likeable sort of a
guy. He's done a swell job this
year, no matter what happens from
here on in, but living up to that !
record in the future is going to be
difficult. t
Everyone makes mistakes, even
j Knute Rockne was guilty of a few
! hutches in his long career. My hope
, is that when the breaks gang up on
' him and he boots a couple, the
j alumni will remember that Clark
! Shaughnessy has proved his ability
j as a coach, and will prove it again.

J>ITCH JOHNSON may be given
credit for bringing to light an
event that should prove one of the
most popular on the intramural
i program.
The Irish Marathon run off Sat
urday morning was a success both
from the standpoint of the competi
tors and the spectators.
In the first annual running of

this race, the one-two teams, the
Sigma Nus and the Alpha Delts,
were only 15 yards apart at the
finish of the three-mile route. It
was a close race and an interest
ing one to watch all the way.
