# Cards Tie UCLA In Soccer Tilt
## 
### 
The U.C.L.A. Bruin soccer team
gained a certain amount of revenge
last Saturday by battling the In
dian kickers to a 2-2 standstill. In
the first meeting the Bruins bowed
3-2.
The Bruins drew first blood by
scoring early in the first period, but
the score was tied up when sure
footed George Dole connected with
a penalty kick. Second-string cen
ter forward Francis Morgan put the
Indians into the lead in the third
period by taking a head pass from
right forward George LaNicca and
scoring.
U.C.L.A. came back in the final
quarter to score on a penalty kick,
and from then on both teams bat
tled in the center of the field until
the end of the game.
