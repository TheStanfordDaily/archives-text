Johnny Grant in 10 flat and 22.2.
Another frosh, quarter-miler Bill
Spaulding, nipped Bob Smith in 51.7

ing pace for 300 yards.
Going over the last flight exactly
even, Vern Hart and Ed Hertel fin

the highs, with the judges giving
the nod to Hertel. Hart cleared 6
feet, 2% inches in the high jump
to defeat Lincoln, while Ed Tomaso
looked good with a 13-foot job in
the pole vault.
