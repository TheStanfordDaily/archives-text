# Splashers Bow Before Bruins
## 
### 
After absorbing a 15-5 beating at
the hands of the U.C.L.A. water polo
squad in Los Angeles earlier in
the season, the- Stanford splashers
came back strong last Friday after
noon and managed to keep the Bruin
supporters in a continual state of
suspense as they lost in a close
5-4 battle.
Led by substitute forward Fred
Manwaring, who scored two of the
Indians' four goals, the Cards
showed that they would be a defi
nite threat to Cal in the first of the
two-game series, which is to be
played in the Encina Pool tomorrow
afternoon.
Led by Grant Culley, high-scoring
sensation, who accounted for six of
the frosh scores, the freshman de
feated Sequoia High School 8-3 in
the preliminary to the varsity tilt.
Colonel Charles A. Lindbergh's
mother-in-law, Mrs. Dwight Mor
row, is acting president of Smith
College.
