# Polomen Take Two from Utes
## 
### 
The Stanford pool team galloped 1
rough-shod over the University of
Utah riders Friday, with a 7-3
score. Led by Captain Joe Smith,
the Indians tallied twice in the sec
ond chukker before Utah managed
to score.
A previous game had been played
on Wednesday, ending in a 3-3 tie.
Both teams agreed to settle this ini
tial contest by awarding the deci
sion to the team that scored first in
the Friday game. Stanford made the
first point, thus winning both games.
The Indians drove the ball through
the goal twice in the second period,
three times in the third and twice
again in the last period of the six
chukker game. Utah scored one goal
in the "s6c6nd, third, and chuk
kers.
A. T. LaPrade played an out
standing game at No. 3 position, ac
counting for four of the seven Stan
ford goals. Each of the other three
players, Mike Gates, Captain Smith,
and Stan Glikbarg, scored once.
Gates at No. 1 position was very
largely responsible for the smashing
Cardinal attack, by repeatedly rid
ing out the Utah defense men.
Captain Fenton of Utah tried to
stage a comeback in the last period,
but despite a Utah tally by Nuttle,
the powerful Stanford aggregation
marked up two more on the score
board.
