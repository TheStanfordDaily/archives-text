# A 						Second Nomination
## 
### 
WHEN the presidential race was safely con
signed to the historians and the debris of
political campaigning was swept into little piles
and labeled '"national unity," a handful of Stan
ford alumni began discussing the selection oi
another President —the President of this Uni
versity.
These discussions were spontaneous affairs.
They led to no concerted group action. To a
large degree they were simply speculations of
the "wouldn't it be nice if" type.
The people who considered the name of
Wendell Willkie seemed to believe that, though
he was not elected President of the United
States, he might make a successful President
of Stanford University.
It is obvious that Mr. Willkie has certain
scholarly inclinations. Last spring he indicated
that nothing would please him more than act
ing as head of a college. As a brilliant lawyer,
an able speaker, and a man of positive personal
magnetism, Mr. Willkie might offer Stanford
much. As a sane business man and a friend of
large industrial leaders, he might bring tangible
gain to a University whose financial status
needs a boost.
No one knows, of course, whether or not
Wendell Willkie has given up serious political
office-seeking, whether he is ready to settle
down to a less turbulent but very large job—
that of administering the affairs of an educa
tional institution. Similarly, no one knows
whether or not Mr. Willkie would like to live
"on the Farm."
No superficial evaluation such as this can
draw any clear conclusions. It is certainly true
that Stanford, as a well-accredited school, would
suffer from attempts to convert it into a political
springboard.
All that is clear at this time is the fact that
Wendell Willkie's name has been placed in
nomination for the presidency of Stanford. It
will in time receive consideration, perhaps.
But it will be only one of 200 names submit
ted to the committee.
