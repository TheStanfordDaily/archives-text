# Bellwether on Buttons
## 
### 
OUR amiable friend Bellwether would wince
to the gills if he had ever been the sub
ject of the appellation "smooth." The Bell
wether sweater and trou are never directly
opposed to the trend of fashion, but to Emery
they are merely external coverings to keep off
the wind, the #un and the rain.
But it was a sodden Bellwether that bumped
around the corner of the P.O. as the tower
chimes sounded 8 p.m. A Bellwether whose
jeans and T-shirt were unspeakable. A be
hatted Bellwether with brim low over his eyes.
"Just a second, Emery," I called. "What's
doing?"
The sage straightened. "Laddie, you recog
nize me? I thought this disguise was impene
trable. Well, I guess beauty can't be hidden."
I he Great Man shaded his eyes with a ham
like hand and peered under a neighboring bush.
"Laddie, can you ke£p a secret?"
"Within reason. After all, I'm human."
"Debatable, debatable. Anyway, I'll let you
in on something. I'm scouting some illegal
rushing for the mob."
"What mob, Bellwether?"
"Incidental. Scouting's the thing. There's a
sport that takes talent."
"Talent?"
"Oh, you know. Scouting down leads, fol
lowing black sedans and all that sort of thing."
Bellwether drew lines on the street with a
burlap-covered toe.
"Any luck along these lines, Emery?"
The Great Man blushed. "Well, some. Fol
lowed one party to a cabin on the Skyline the
other night. Great party. Brew and pledge pins
flying around in fine fashion. They thought I
was the caretaker."
I can see why, Bellwether. Any more luck?"
Emery dismissed the insinuation. "Three
frosh and two upperclassmen went to San Jose
a while back. My operative in Los Angeles
phoned that they passed through a day ago.
Not coming back until formal pledge day, I
guess."
I grinned. "Rather drastic measures, Bell
wether."
results, boy."
Bellwether waved a tish-tishing forefinger.
Funniest one was taking two young lads to
the carnival and keeping them on the loop-a
plane all evening. They were too dizzy to even

notice the pledge pins. Marvelous workers,
marvelous."
"Gad, Emery, this must keep you busy day
and night!"
"Oh, no. All I've got are five or six good
customers. The rest just aren't any fun to watch
at all. lust plain conservatives." The sage
shook his head. "My mob isn't interested in
them."
The chimes rang eight-thirty. Bellwether ad
justed his hat. "Must be off, laddie. Got a trail
to follow."
"Tally-ho, Bellwether, where to?"
"Up to the hills back of campus, laddie. We're
rushing a guy to join our mob."—W. C.

"Gad, Emery, this must keep you busy day

"Oh, no. All I've got are five or six good
customers. The rest just aren't any fun to watch
at all. lust plain conservatives." The sage
shook his head. "My mob isn't interested in
them."
The chimes rang eight-thirty. Bellwether ad
justed his hat. "Must be off, laddie. Got a trail
to follow."
"Tally-ho, Bellwether, where to?"
"Up to the hills back of campus, laddie. We're
rushing a guy to join our mob."—W. C.
OUR amiable friend Bellwether would wince
to the gills if he had ever been the sub
ject of the appellation "smooth." The Bell
wether sweater and trou are never directly
opposed to the trend of fashion, but to Emery
they are merely external coverings to keep off
the wind, the #un and the rain.
But it was a sodden Bellwether that bumped
around the corner of the P.O. as the tower
chimes sounded 8 p.m. A Bellwether whose
jeans and T-shirt were unspeakable. A be
hatted Bellwether with brim low over his eyes.
"Just a second, Emery," I called. "What's
doing?"
The sage straightened. "Laddie, you recog
nize me? I thought this disguise was impene
trable. Well, I guess beauty can't be hidden."
I he Great Man shaded his eyes with a ham
like hand and peered under a neighboring bush.
"Laddie, can you ke£p a secret?"
"Within reason. After all, I'm human."
"Debatable, debatable. Anyway, I'll let you
in on something. I'm scouting some illegal
rushing for the mob."
"What mob, Bellwether?"
"Incidental. Scouting's the thing. There's a
sport that takes talent."
"Talent?"
"Oh, you know. Scouting down leads, fol
lowing black sedans and all that sort of thing."
Bellwether drew lines on the street with a
burlap-covered toe.
"Any luck along these lines, Emery?"
The Great Man blushed. "Well, some. Fol
lowed one party to a cabin on the Skyline the
other night. Great party. Brew and pledge pins
flying around in fine fashion. They thought I
was the caretaker."
I can see why, Bellwether. Any more luck?"
Emery dismissed the insinuation. "Three
frosh and two upperclassmen went to San Jose
a while back. My operative in Los Angeles
phoned that they passed through a day ago.
