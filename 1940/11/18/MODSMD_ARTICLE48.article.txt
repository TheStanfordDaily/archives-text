# BULL SESSION

### BUD AMES 
WE ARE POOR LITTLE COWS, WHO . . .
in, we're inâ€”we're in, we're in.
It sounds great, and after you've rolled it over
your tongue a few times, just like a sip of good
wine, it sounds even better. It get's to be a chant,
something you will sit up in your bed at night and
scream.
Yes, sir, we're in the Rose Bowl. And that is
something to be proud of, since only one team in
eight gets to go there each year. And frankly, at
the beginning of this fall you could have gotten 100-
to-1 odds that the ol' Red an' White would be grunt
ing around the Rose Bowl come this New Year's Day.
Now we are over the hump. The only question
now seems to be. "Who are we going to play (beat) in
the Rose Bowl?"

r JPHE unhappy consensus of public opinion seems to
indicate that Texas A. & M., on the strength of
their southern gridiron triumphs, will ride their steers
north to the land of roses and richness and rigor
mortis.
And, another consensus of opinion, this time of
student opinion, seems to indicate just as strongly
that the Fanners and Farmerettes sort of wish it
wouldn't be Texas A. & M.
They just don't think much of the idea of an
agricultural and mechanical school with a history and
heritage no longer than a nickel beer walking in on
the most coveted plum in football circles.
Not that there is anything wrong with an agri
cultural and mechanical school in itself. Farmers and
miners are fine people. So are bankers and beer bar
ons. So is everybody else. But, these students feel,
the American public can't get very excited about a
game wtih an agricultural and mining school. There
just isn't any color.
'J 1 HAT'S it. They haven't got any of that intangible
stuff you call "color." And don't say that color
doesn't make the difference between a successful and
unsuccessful Rose Bowl game. Color is the Rose Bowl
game.
But where is the color in the Texas Agricultural
and Mechanical college? There are no rich songs such
as they have at Cornell, "the pride of tha Yeast."
There is no back history of Big Ten championships
such as is held by Minnesota.
There is nothing, nothing but agriculture, and big
men. and mechanics, and a lot of roughies who will
jitney into Pasadena in best Okie style.
Can't you just picture it. There you are, sitting in
the coveted Rose Bowl. The crowd is tense, silent
for a moment, an dthen from across the stadium
comes the last strains of the Texas A. & M. anthem.
". .. All hail to the land of cows and steers;
Hail our mines too.
All hail our alma mater dear,
Moo, moo, moo."
