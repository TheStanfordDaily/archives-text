"pHE EDITOR, SIR:
The calm of evening, dog, and blazing fire is in
terrupted by a radio news item: "Alumni seek Wendell
j Willkie as president of Stanford."
Not being part of that passel of "alumni" whose
demands are so often heard, we do deem it none the
less fitting and proper that we raise our voices at this
point, lest a horrid joke turn into a new adminis
tration for the Farm.
Stanford is an institution of learning, albeit one
with occasional twinges of Republicanism. Republic
anism is after all always with us. A minor vice of
Senator Stanford s, 85's head raised highest from '28 to
32, and now hangs little lower. If Republican virtue is
to be the test of fitness for office of the president of our
university, it ill behooves us. to reach out to Elwood,
Indiana, when San Juan hill is close at hand.
Stanford is more attuned to the free discussion of
all sides of every issue than to serve as the rostrum
for the spokesmen of the "loyal opposition."
What Stanford needs is not so much a power house
of Commonwealth and Southern design, as a live,
quick, and understanding scholar: a Jordan, a Hutch
ins, a Dykstra, a restless scholar, who will convert
Die Luft der Freiheit from a sirocco into a roarinc
wind.
When we consider—as the country must—that Stan
; ford is as close as it is to Palo Alto, it is apparent that
: our choice of a president for Stanford concerns not
only the adherence of the university, but likewise the
j community, the state, .and the nation.
j Let the sun set singly on San Juan Hill.
Very truly yours,
Hal Von Breton '34, David McllinkofT '34

i TPHE EDITOR. SIR:
i I would like to call attention to a rather special
I case in connection with the use of student body cards
by others than their original owners. Some of the
student assistants at the University enjoy the games.
Many of us are forced, for one reason or another, to
register on the unit basis. In so doing, we have the
! privilege of paying a la carte for the various items
listed by Mr. Stepp. We may pay $5 Guild Fees (Health
Service). We may pay the required fee for the use
of the gymnasium. We may subscribe to The Daily.
But we may not, to my knowledge, pay $1 for the
privilege of sitting in the rooting section. In the past
some of us have borrowed student body cards with
out too great qualms of conscience.
| We are students. We have the right to sit in the
rooting section even though Mr. Stepp and the B.A.C.
withhold the privilege. After all, the only justifica
tion for a football season is the pleasure derived from
it by the students, on and of! the team. The fact that
the B.A.C. is able to grub a few dollars to help pay
for minor sports would be all to the good if the
B.A.C. would remember that they are here for the
students' benefit, and not vice versa.
May I suggest, then, that graduate students regis
| tercd on the unit basis be permitted to buy game
l privilege tickets for the rooting section? At a reason
-1 able price? Say $1 (cf. Stepp)?
And while I am at it, may I also suggest that the
I faculty be given passes to the games? Isn't that carry-
I ing commercialism a little too far?
Sincerely,
j '" J • ~ Alex Calhoun
