# James Hilton Blames War On Democracies' Apathy
## 
### 
All the withdrawal and idealism that characterized "Good-bye Mr.
Chips" and "Lost Horizon" caine to life again last Thursday night on the
stage of the San Francisco Memorial Opera House. James Hilton looked
at the world through Mr. Chips' eyes and found it "a place not Ut to live

in, but only to live under." i
During the short but arresting
speech, it was not hard to imagine
that the beloved old schoolmaster
was sitting in front of his fire and
chatting on present day events over
a cup of tea. Yet James Hilton al
lowed none of his imagination to
color the existing state of affairs.
"Those were happy days, happier
than today when the diabolical
forces are not fantasies but strange
and terrible truths," he mused.
HAD TO COME
Strangely enough, being an Eng
lishman, James Hilton does not
blame the "rather disagreeable man,"
Hitler, for this chaos. He says that
even if Hitler had died ten years
ago the battle would still exist, for
it is not a new battle.
"The struggle of brute force
against the conscience of man has
existed since ancient days—since the
day that conscience was born."
BLAMES THE PAST
He blames the post-war attitude
for the present situation. In that
fateful year of 1919 the great chance
came and went. Instead of showing
a "generosity rising out of strength"
or even a completely ruthless de
stroyal of Germany, the victors took
a middle course.
"Charity and wisdom then could
have prevented fumbling today. But
the victors were not super men and
they lacked vision. They chose a
happy mean, a peace that was
either too harsh or not harsh
enough."
ENGLAND ALSO
He does not spare the part of Eng
land in all this "gigantic mess."
When the war was over, the Eng
lishman lapsed into a state of apathy.
He saw a "long golden afternoon of
declining effort." Europe and its
problems were remote and "Polly
anna with a British accent stalked
the streets of Mayfair."
Mr. Hilton accuses the world of
not appreciating democracy while it
had it. Like the League of Nations,
democracy was given "too much
popular approval and no private
faith—lip service but not enough
mind service and soul service."
PRESENTS PANACEA
Finally, questioning whether the
world has arisen out of apathy in
time to prevent the great "con
spiracy" against it from working,
James Hilton gives his solution
should democracy survive.
"My brightest hope is in an emerg
ing shape, something that may be

bom out of the hearts of men, an
English-speaking union."
The British vice-consul who in
troduced Mr. Hilton followed the
applause by saying Mr. Hilton would
answer questions. However, as si
lence reigned, James Hilton smiled
and with a characteristic bit of hu
mor remarked, "I will take that as a
compliment. I seem to have left
everyone breathless."—Deane
