BORIS of Bulgaria visited
Adolf Hitler in Germany Sun
day.
On the sui-face this is not spec
tacular news.
But in this short bulletin may
rest the clue to the Hitler-Molotov
meeting in Germany last week
which has kept the world on edge j
ever since.
For some time it has been ex
pected that Hitler would come to
the support of Italy in the Balkans
and continue her drive to the oil
fields of the Near East. There have
been three possible "obstacles" to
this plan — Bulgaria, Russia, and
Turkey.
But the only major stumbling
block has been Russia.
The decision of Turkey would
have to depend upon that of the
Soviet for she is not strong enough
to stand alone in the road of a
German drive. This became more
evident when Turkey failed to live
up to her defense alliance with
Greece, but waited instead to see
what Russia would do.
And Bulgaria, although geograph
ically in the way of a German
drive, could never be expected to
hold up the Nazi military machine.
The only question that interested
the Germans was whether she
could count on Bulgaria to submit
peacefully or whether she would be
forced to crush feeble Bulgarian
resistance.
But Bulgaria was an ally of
Germany during World War I and
she has been pro-Nazi since the
outbreak of the present conflict.
The chances are that she would
permit German troops to pass
through the country without of
fering resistance.
>»t * »J«
r |' , HE only real obstacle, then, has
been Russia and the question
was whether she would sanction
Germany's drive through the stra
tegic straits region which tradition
ally she has considered within her
own sphere of influence, even
though controlled by another power.
Knig Boris' trip to Berlin followed
Molotov's visit within little more
than a week—a factor that may be
significant.
If Molotov's did give Hitler per
mission to extend his "new Europe"
into Bulgaria, Turkey* and the Near
East, the Fuhrer would be inter
ested in learning at first hand Bul
garia's official position or at least in
concluding some agreement with
that country in the event she is al
ready in compliance wtih Ger
many's "Berlin-to-Baghdad dream."
It. is possible that Hitler spoke
with King Boris in order to insure
Bulgaria's co-operation in the "new
Europe" plans that he is allegedly
discussing with representatives of
other countries at the present time.
Another possibility is that Hit
ler plans to attack Greece from the
north. Such an attack would ne
cessitate the passage of troops
through Bulgaria.
* * *
r l' , o ACHIEVE his long-range
"Drach Nach Osten," Hitler
needs the co-operation of Bulgaria
and also the capitulation of Greece.
Hitler may not have discussed
with Boris the long-range objective
of the oil fields of the Near East,
but it. seems probable that one or
both of the other topics was con
sidered.
Meanwhile an anticipated meeting
in Vienna this week among German,
Italian, Hungarian, and Rumanian
drew most speculation from the
press.
And in Berlin it was announced
that Hitler met the foreign minis
ters of Italy and Spain in conversa
tions which were described as the
"second diplomatic offensive" against
their enemies. According to Nazi
sources the "first diplomatic offen
sive" was concluded with the laying
down of plans for a "new Europe."
They claim that the second stage
will see the start of operations to
make these plans a reality.
Possibly King Boris' little-publi
cized visit has something to do with
Htiler's next move.

drew most speculation from the

that Hitler met the foreign minis

But in this short bulletin may
rest the clue to the Hitler-Molotov
meeting in Germany last week
which has kept the world on edge j
ever since.
For some time it has been ex
pected that Hitler would come to
the support of Italy in the Balkans
and continue her drive to the oil
fields of the Near East. There have
been three possible "obstacles" to
this plan — Bulgaria, Russia, and
Turkey.
But the only major stumbling
block has been Russia.
The decision of Turkey would
have to depend upon that of the
Soviet for she is not strong enough
to stand alone in the road of a
German drive. This became more
evident when Turkey failed to live
up to her defense alliance with
Greece, but waited instead to see
what Russia would do.
And Bulgaria, although geograph
ically in the way of a German
drive, could never be expected to
hold up the Nazi military machine.
The only question that interested
the Germans was whether she
could count on Bulgaria to submit
peacefully or whether she would be
forced to crush feeble Bulgarian
resistance.
But Bulgaria was an ally of
Germany during World War I and
she has been pro-Nazi since the
outbreak of the present conflict.
The chances are that she would
permit German troops to pass
through the country without of
fering resistance.

Germany's drive through the stra

ally she has considered within her

though controlled by another power.
Knig Boris' trip to Berlin followed
Molotov's visit within little more
than a week—a factor that may be
significant.
If Molotov's did give Hitler per
mission to extend his "new Europe"
into Bulgaria, Turkey* and the Near
East, the Fuhrer would be inter
ested in learning at first hand Bul
garia's official position or at least in
concluding some agreement with
that country in the event she is al
ready in compliance wtih Ger
many's "Berlin-to-Baghdad dream."
