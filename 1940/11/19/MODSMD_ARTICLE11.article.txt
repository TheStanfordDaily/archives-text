# Lewis Asks for Co-operation In Disunited CIO Convention
## 
### 
ATLANTIC CITY, N.J., Nov. IK (UP). —John L Lewis pleaded today
with delegates to the third annual Congress of Industrial Organizations
convention to cease their "damnable bickering" so that his top flight lien -
tenant, Philip Murray, will accept the C.1.0. presidency.
Tears welled in Lewis' eyes from three ovations as he went before the
convention to make his valedictory—to announce his plan to retire from

pffice, to plead for unity, to advocate
election of a "more unified leader
ship" to which the membership
could give unstinted support, to
denounce the Democratic party's
failure to improve living standards,
and to denounce as lies allegations
that, Communists, Nazis or Fascists
conceive, endorse or support C.1.0.
policies.
LOOK TO SELVES
Lewis made no reference to
A.F.L.-C.1.0. peace, on which the
delegates expect a new unity ap
peal from Mr. Roosevelt; and his
only reference to his political pol
icy was a warning to members that
they must depend on themselves,
and be wary of hoping that the
Democratic party will do away with
the poll tax in the South or lift the
standard of living of what Lewis de
scribed as "52,000,000 shrunken bel
lies."
Telegrams from 23 C.1.0. locals
and C.1.0. members urging that
Lewis' resignation be rejected, and
three urging its acceptance, were
read at the afternoon session of the
C.1.0. convention.
LOOK TO FUTURE
As Lewis spoke it was apparent
that he was concerned about the
future of the now-divided C.1.0.
It was reported that Murray had
told him that he was hesitant to
take the presidency withou an af
firmative demonstration of its unity.
