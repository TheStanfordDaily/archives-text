The terror of Ihe freshman
R.O.T.C. students at Stanford is one
ex-cavalryman, Sergeant Cashen by
name. By the time the students
have weathered four years of the
military department, he is affec
tionately known as "Joe," whose
bark is worse than his bite.
In addition to being first sergeant
I of the enlisted men and supply ser
i geant of the unit, he is also assist
ant instructor in equitation and draft,
j When he gets through with a class,
j both horses and riders arc more than
I willing to admit that, he knows his
| business.
HERE SINCE 1 Dl'.ft
Having been connected with the
Stanford R.O.T.C. since 15KJ0, he has
seen many students come and go
and sees little change in one class
from the other, "Stanford students
j are always Rood," he says. This
j year, with the enrollment in the
| military department above capacity,
| he thinks they arc a more serious
lot, paying more attention to their
military work, with an eye to the
I future.
The sergeant's special interest is
in horses and his own. named Star,
! is naturally the best in the stable,
; according to him. Star is an ace polo
! pony and enjoys doing some fancy
i tricks if an audience is present.
