# Second Annual Big Game Dance to Highlight Return Of Axe, Stanford Victory
## S.F. Club Picked As Ideal Location For Festivities 
### 
"What shall we do Big Game
night?"
More than 700 Stanford students
found the ideal answer to that ever
perplexing question last year when
they attended the first annual
A.S.S.U.-sponsored Big Game dance.
This year, with so much more
to celebrate, the traditional Axe on
display, the larger San Fi-ancisco
Golf and Country Club, and Freddy
Nagel and his orchestra, the ideal
answer for 1940 Big Game night will
again be forthcoming.
In fact, Chairman Bob Beckham
and his committee have thought of
practically everything.
Foreseeing that most students who
go to the game will have no place to
change from clothes dusty and dirty
from the happy trek across the floor
of Berkeley's Memorial Stadium to
smooth semi-formal attire, the com
mittee has arranged for special
lounge and dressing rooms at the
club for both men and women. These
rooms will be open to all students
attending the dance at any time
during the evening.
NAGEL PLAYS
For jubilant dancers, the "youth
ful and refreshing music of Freddy
Nagel" will echo through three of
the clubhouse rooms and an outdoor
patio.
Decorations, with the motif slight
ly on the cardinal side, will simu
late a football field replete with
goal posts and all the trimmings, in
cluding, of course, The Axe, the
original one and only.
And for those who expended all
their available energy cheering for
the team and don't feel like dancing
all the time there will be lots of
overstuffed easy chairs and couches.
A PRICE CUT
Best information of all for stu
dents of the penny-pinching class,
no small percentage of Farm resi
dents, was the announcement that
the price of bids had been reduced
to $3 per couple. These bids are on
sale at the A.S.S.U. office.
The dance will truly be completely
Stanford in atmosphere, decora
tions, and band. Freddy Nagel is an
old Stanford man from way back.
He transferred here in his junior
year from the University of Nevada
and went on to receive a degree in
Electrical Engineering. He was a
member of Sigma Nu.

The dance will truly be completely
Stanford in atmosphere, decora
tions, and band. Freddy Nagel is an
old Stanford man from way back.
He transferred here in his junior
year from the University of Nevada
and went on to receive a degree in
Electrical Engineering. He was a
member of Sigma Nu.
"What shall we do Big Game
night?"
More than 700 Stanford students
found the ideal answer to that ever
perplexing question last year when
they attended the first annual
A.S.S.U.-sponsored Big Game dance.
This year, with so much more
to celebrate, the traditional Axe on
display, the larger San Fi-ancisco
Golf and Country Club, and Freddy
Nagel and his orchestra, the ideal
answer for 1940 Big Game night will
again be forthcoming.
In fact, Chairman Bob Beckham
and his committee have thought of
practically everything.
Foreseeing that most students who
go to the game will have no place to
change from clothes dusty and dirty
from the happy trek across the floor
of Berkeley's Memorial Stadium to
smooth semi-formal attire, the com
mittee has arranged for special
lounge and dressing rooms at the
club for both men and women. These
rooms will be open to all students
attending the dance at any time
during the evening.
NAGEL PLAYS
For jubilant dancers, the "youth
ful and refreshing music of Freddy
Nagel" will echo through three of
the clubhouse rooms and an outdoor
patio.
Decorations, with the motif slight
ly on the cardinal side, will simu
late a football field replete with
goal posts and all the trimmings, in
cluding, of course, The Axe, the
original one and only.
And for those who expended all
their available energy cheering for
the team and don't feel like dancing
all the time there will be lots of
overstuffed easy chairs and couches.
A PRICE CUT
Best information of all for stu
dents of the penny-pinching class,
