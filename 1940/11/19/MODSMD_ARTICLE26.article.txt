# Tuesday Series to Spot forum on 'Winter, War'
## Professors to Consider Effects Of Climate, Food Supply on Conflict 
### 
llow will Europeans live and work through this winter? How does
Ihe winter season limit the military, naval, and air war, or does it?
What is the winter in Europe in terms of rain, snow, ice, and tempera
hires? Is it possible that (lie diplomatic strategy of the next four months
can he foreseen in a survey of the climate of Europe?

These and other questions will be,
considered tonight in the symposium
on "Winter and War" to be given
for the Tuesday Evening Series in
the Auditorium of the Memorial
Hall at 7:30 o'clock. Merrill K. Ben
nett, professor of economic geogra
phy; Philip W. Buck, associate pro
fessor of political science; and Jo
seph S. Davis, professor of economic
research will participate in the
discussion.
The average temperature in Jan
uary is 52 degrees Fahrenheit in
Athens, 38 degrees in London, and
2d decrees in Warsaw. Freezing
weather in Athens is about as rare
as it is in San Francisco, where
the average January temperature is
50 degrees.
PLENTY OF LIGHT
The battle between the Greeks
and Italians cannot be expected in
the next few weeks to proceed un
der natural conditions comfortable
for the soldiers, according to Dr.
Bennett. They will, it is true, have
more than nine and one-half hours
of daylight for their work.
Those who can stay in the lower
elevations will not be subjected to
freezing temperatures. But there
may be much work to do at high al
titudes in cold and snowy weather,
; nd almost everywhere on very
choppy terrain.
IiAIN LOOKS BAD
"To one not familiar with mili
tary science, the onset of the rainy
weather looks like a queer time to
< hoose for an attack upon Greece,"
pointed out Dr. Bennett.
Dr. Davis will consider present
and prospective adequacy of food
.•-applies. No one can predict or
prophesy with assurance, but Dr.
Davis believes that we can construct
reasonably adequate picture of
v hat the situation actually is from
many bits of current information.
Professor Buck -will discuss the
iplomatic strategy in the fall and
'inter. In his opinion the combina
! on of winter and war is bringing

Europe to the edge of the abyss.
At the close of the three talks, the
meeting will be thrown open for
questions from the audience.

freezing temperatures. But there
may be much work to do at high al
titudes in cold and snowy weather,
; nd almost everywhere on very
choppy terrain.

"To one not familiar with mili
tary science, the onset of the rainy
weather looks like a queer time to
< hoose for an attack upon Greece,"
pointed out Dr. Bennett.
Dr. Davis will consider present
and prospective adequacy of food
.•-applies. No one can predict or
prophesy with assurance, but Dr.
Davis believes that we can construct
reasonably adequate picture of
v hat the situation actually is from
many bits of current information.
Professor Buck -will discuss the
iplomatic strategy in the fall and
'inter. In his opinion the combina
! on of winter and war is bringing

Europe to the edge of the abyss.
At the close of the three talks, the
meeting will be thrown open for
questions from the audience.
llow will Europeans live and work through this winter? How does
Ihe winter season limit the military, naval, and air war, or does it?
What is the winter in Europe in terms of rain, snow, ice, and tempera
hires? Is it possible that (lie diplomatic strategy of the next four months
can he foreseen in a survey of the climate of Europe?

These and other questions will be,
considered tonight in the symposium
on "Winter and War" to be given
for the Tuesday Evening Series in
the Auditorium of the Memorial
Hall at 7:30 o'clock. Merrill K. Ben
nett, professor of economic geogra
phy; Philip W. Buck, associate pro

discussion.
The average temperature in Jan
uary is 52 degrees Fahrenheit in
Athens, 38 degrees in London, and
2d decrees in Warsaw. Freezing
weather in Athens is about as rare
as it is in San Francisco, where
the average January temperature is
50 degrees.
PLENTY OF LIGHT
The battle between the Greeks
and Italians cannot be expected in
the next few weeks to proceed un
der natural conditions comfortable
for the soldiers, according to Dr.
Bennett. They will, it is true, have
more than nine and one-half hours
of daylight for their work.
Those who can stay in the lower
elevations will not be subjected to
freezing temperatures. But there
may be much work to do at high al
titudes in cold and snowy weather,
; nd almost everywhere on very
choppy terrain.
