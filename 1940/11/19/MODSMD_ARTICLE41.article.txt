# Card Paddlers Face Cal
## Victorious Bear Team Seeks Title 
### 
California's unbeaten and untied
water polo team invades the Stan
ford campus this afternoon to play
the Indians in a game that will de
cide whether or not they cinch the
championship this week. If Cal
should lose all the rest of their
games, the worst that they could do
would he a tie for the title, while a
wiji over the Cards would clinch the
trophy for them.
"Comparative scores rate Cal the )
heavy favorites, but this is our big
game, and anything can happen,"
stated Coach Nort Thornton yes
terday.
Boasting tv%'o 8-6 defeats over the
supposedly invincible U.C.L.A. pad- !
dlers, which team defeated Stanford j
twice by scores of 15-5 and 5-4, |
along with a pair of victories over
U.S.C., the men from Berkeley have |
easily proved themselves to be the
standout team in the conference.
bear offense
The Bears play a straight offense, |
with their forwards, Lamb and Ar- !
onson, doing all of the shooting and j
scoring, while the big gun on their I
defense is "Woody" Woodman, cap- |
tain and goalie, who should have !
little trouble making all-Coast. Lamb |
is rated by Bear Coach Dowden as '
being the greatest forward that he
ever coached.
Starting line-up for Stanford will
find Bill Weeden at sprint, Dave
Nottage and Fred Manwaring at for- j
wards, Bob Jones at cent-erback, Bob
Mitchell and Captain Ted Moreno at
guard spots and Bob Breckner in i
the goal.
FROSH CONTEST
The varsity game is to be pre
ceded by a contest between the Card i
and Bear Frosh, who will take to '
the water at 3 o'clock. The Stan- !
ford frosh, who have lost but one I
game to date, are heavy favorites
to win the game on the basis of J
scores against opponents that have I
played both teams, having defeated
Paly and Sequoia high schools twice j
each, while the Cal frosh have lost j
to each of them.
"I am counting heavily on Grant j
Culley, whom I consider to be the I
best freshman forward to enter I
Stanford in several years, to pro- !
vide the offensive punch that we
will need to lick Cal," announced |
Coach Thornton.
CARRY WEIGHT
The brunt of the defensive bur- I
den will be carried by Price, Blatt. j
and Decius, with Peter Lee, another |
outstanding frosh, in the goalie po- !
sition.
The Frosh game will start at 3
o'clock and the varsity will take to !
the water at. 4:15 o'clock. There will j
be a charge of 25 cents for those
presenting student bodv cards.
