# SIDELINE SLANTS

### JERRY BRUCKER 
INTERCOLUMNAR dissension is a
bad thing at its best, and a good
1 thing at its worst, or something I
equally confusing, and we hesitate j
:to come to journalistic grips with
| such an erudite gentleman as the !
Daily's Bull Sessioner, but here goes.
In the past we have refrained from j
! violent combat with Mr. Ames, even
! when he poached repeatedly on j
! what we consider our private and j
I sacred property, the field of sports, I
1 mainly because we considered him
j a right guy and a good Republican,
! but now the time has come.
For now we have caught the
man with the unruly hair in a
conglomeration of statements with
which we totally, heartily, and ab
solutely disagree. We refer to his
satirical little diatribe yeysterday
morn devoted to the Texas School
of Agriculture and Mining.
Our colleague based his remarks
! on the assumption that Texas A. & i
M. would oppose Stanford in the i
j Rose Bowl come New Year's Day,
; 1941. Needless to point out, that's
taking a lot for granted, but just for
| the sake of argument we'll let it :
j ride.

B UD ' S main objection to the
i champs of the Southwest is that
| they lack "that intangible stuff you j
call color." Mebbeso. But there are
! an awful lot of people who've seen
| 'em play, and who ' listened to the
Sugar Bowl game last New Year's.
You take a team with a hell-for-
S leather fullback like Jolting John
Kimbrough, who, no matter how
i much we favor our own Chief Norm
i Standlee, is a lot better than a
mediocre football player, and you,
1 have a pretty good start in the line
j of "color."
Toss in a pass threat capably
handled by halfback Marion Pugh,
a sensational sophomore end named
Kill Henderson, round it out with
a gang of less publicized players
good enough to perform the tra
dition-breaking feat of winning
the Southwest Conference title
two years hand running, and you
have an organization almost as
colorful as Mr. Ames' best tie.

Aggies don't have a song
comparable to "Far Above
Cayuga's Waters." They don't boast
as long and distinguished a record j
I on the gridiron as Minnesota's Gold- i
en Gophers. But. Mr. Ames, would j
you like to see Yale or Wisconsin j
in the Pasadena Gravy Bowl this I
year. No? But Yale has been play
ing football since time began, and
Wisconsin is generally conceded to
have the prettiest goldurned fij>ht :
song you ever heard.
It's on football merits that teams
are chosen to play in the Pasa
dena classic, and the lads from
College Station, Tex., have the
second best in the land these days.
They have compiled a long un
defeated string, whereas Minne
sota has won two games this year
by one point, another by four
points, and beat Ohio State when
they were outgained more than
2-1.
The Illini Union is being rushed
to completion at the University of
Illinois.
