# Shaunees Want Cornell in Bowl
## 
### 
—On a strictly personal basis, Stan
ford's blue ribbon football boys ap
parently want to play either Cornell,
Minnesota or Texas Aggies—in about
that order of choice—in the Rose
Bowl, a very informal poll showed
tonight.
'"The Aggies look like the best
bet as a Rose Bowl opponent to
me," said Frank (Little Prince) Al
bert.
CORNELL DISAPPOINTS
"I was a little disappointed in Cor
nell because they didn't beat Dart
mouth by a bigger score," Albert
added. (He didn't know yet that
Cornell today relinquished the 7-3
victory and gave it to Dartmouth,
3-0, on a referee's error).
On the other hand, Hugh Gallar
neau, Albert's backfield running
mate, is for Cornell.
"I'd think the boys would like to
get a crack at Cornell." said Hugh,
"or possibly Minnesota."
CORNELL VOTE
Fred Meyer, end, and fraternity
brother of Albert, wanted Cornell.
"Cornell's got a good record, de
spite the Dartmouth affair," said
Meyer. "They'd be a good drawing
card.
Stan (Boscoe) Graff, end, wanted
Minnesota or Cornell.
"I'd like to prick that Cornell
bubble," he said.
Carl Warnecke, tackle, wanted
Minnesota as his first choice and
Cornell as his second choice.
ANOTHER HURDLE
Coach Clark Shaughnessy doesn't
talk about it.
"We've still got to beat California
a week from Saturday," he said.
