The Daily in the October 3 issue printed an editorial
entitled "We Are in Whose Army Now?" by Bill Rogers,
which was answered by George Hislop. A copy was also
sent to Governor Culbeit I. Olson, who in turn forwarded
it to Secretary ot War Henry L. Stimson. The following is
Secretary Stimson's answer. The Editor
Hon. Culbert L. Olson,
Governor of California,
Sacramento, California
Dear Governor Olson:
Your letter of October 7th enclosing an edi
torial by Bill Rogers in the "Beverly Hills Citi
zen" has been read by me with much interest.
Its importance would deserve a personal answer
even if Bill Rogers' father had not been a per
sonal friend of mine. That last fact adds deeply
to the interest I take in answering it.
The basic reason for the situation which young
Rogers complains of and with which I am myself
personally only too familiar is not delinguency
on the part of the officers of the Army but the
attitude taken towards the Army in peace time
by our whole population including to a certain
extent him and you and me. This attitude has
been traditional and historic dating back to the
beginning of our government. It has been our
unvarying habit whenever a war was over—
and thus far fortunately all our wars have ended
with success—to forget the war and the meth
ods, mental, spiritual, and physical, by which
we had won it, as guickly as possible and to
subside into the confidence that no other war
would ever come. This atitude of our population
has necessarily reflected itself in the attitude of
Congress towards the Army. Appropriations to
keep up any sort of preparedness in the Army
or to furnish it with the weapons necessary for
it to use in modern warfare have been consid
ered a rather unnecessary expense and have not
been given. It takes a great deal of money to
keep an army up to date during a period of such
dramatic changes in mechanical equipment as
have occurred during the last twenty years.
And so when the present emergency arose our
Army did not have such equipment. It had only
the stocks of old artillery and rifles and other
material which had been stored up in our ar
senals and warehouses since we laid them aside
twenty-one years ago. That is why young Rog
ers found himself drilling with horsedrawn ar
tillery and hacking along our modern roads on
horses instead of racing along in motor cars and
with mechanized guns. I was an artilleryman in
the Great War myself and /ecognize quite as
keenly as Mr. Rogers the obsolescence of the
weapon with which he was drilled, but such
weapons are the best we have now in sufficient
quantities to train our young men. And our ex
perience in this respect is not unique. The
young men of Great Britain have been having
exactly the same experience and in fact their
Home Guards are now armed and trained in
large part with surplus artillery of the same kind
which they have purchased from us. They did
not have the stocks of these old weapons in suf
ficient quantities when the war hit them. We
fortunately had enough for us both.
As you can see, this is not the fault of the
officers of the Army as young Rogers seems to
think. On the contrary, no element of our popu
lation has suffered so much from the realization
that we were falling behind in our defense
weapons as the patriotic officers of the Army.
And nobody realizes as clearly as they do how
dangerous our condition is or are working so
hard to remedy it as those same officers. It is
due to the foresight and intelligence of those
officers that we do have today the beginnings of
a new mechanized equipment. During the long
years of forgetfulness on the part of their coun
trymen they have themselves been keeping
abreast in their studies and experiments of the
development of artillery and other ordnance
abroad. And as a result of that foresight, now
that the money has been given us we are build
ing for the Army not only speedy and effective
mechanized artillery but new varieties of all
other kinds of weapons which will compare
very favorably with those even of the Germans.
But it takes many months and in some cases
years to turn out such weapons in sufficient
quantities to supply the young men who use
them when the time comes. As I happen to
know from the secret reports which I am now
privileged to read, even the German Army itself
in its successful campaign in France, although
it had been preparing itself for war for three or
four years, was still largely equipped with
horsedrawn artillery and horsedrawn trucks.
I am sorry that Mr. Rogers does not appreciate
the R.O.T.C. I think he is sadly mistaken in this
respect. But, owing to my age, I am able to
compare the modern R.O.T.C. with our absence
of any such school for young officers in 1917
and prior. The R.O.T.C. is a great improvement
on our situation then. It is an institution which
has taken time to develop to its present effi
ciency but it is now turning out far better trained
officers than any of us citizen officers in 1917.
So in summary my reaction to Mr. Rogers'
editorial is this: I am very glad that he is so
patriotic and so interested in our national wel
fare that he is ready himself to contemplate
serving his country in this crisis and to take the
time necessary for training as he says he has
done. I realize that hundreds of thousands of

other young men are like him and that these
young men deserve the best training and the
best care their government can give them. That
is what we here in the War Department are try
ing to do and that is what the officers of the
Regular Army and the National Guard are try
ing to do. But Mr. Rogers must remember that,
solely owing to our national attitude towards
war and the Army, we start a long ways behind
scratch and that it will take untiring effort and
zeal on the part of all concerned to be ready
to defend this country against some of the pos
sible enemies in the world who now confront it.
So I hope he will give more of his time towards
developing this common spirit of patriotism and
energy than to railing at "fossilism" and red
tape and lack of initiative on the part of the
Army, which do not really exist. It is true that
our equipment is now old-fashioned but before
Mr. Rogers has finished his year of training
which we are ready to give him, he will have
had a good deal of opportunity to train with
modern equipment or 1 am greatly mistaken.
Very sincerely yours,
HENRY L. STIMSON,
Secretary of War
