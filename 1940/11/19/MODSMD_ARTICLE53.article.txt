### BUD AMES 
A PLEA IN TIME SAVES . . . TWENTY BUCKS
i IJEHE we are back on this subject of Rose Bowl
repercussions again. But since they are of much
concern to everyone of you Farmers and Farmerettes,
they are worth a few column inches of pro and con
1 discussion.
This time it's the question of what to do in Los
I Angeles on New Year's Eve.
Tliat takes money. Yes, sir, yes, sir, three bugs
J full; one for the cash drawer, one for that dame, and
{ one for general running expenses such as orchids,
cigarettes, tips, orchids, cigarettes, and tips, and orchids.
And on New Year's Eve you can just multiply the
usual price by the number of sweater fuzz strands on
your tuxedo front.
No matter how you figure it, if you're planning to
; take your girlie to one of those Los Angeles holduptels
i on New Year's Eve you had better start selling your
I parents down the river right now.

; in round numbers—you can always figure
1 it by the round on New Year's Eve—a fair-sized
' evening with a one quart, girl at any of the Los An
j geles hotels or night spots will cost you close to $20
j or $25 before you are through—and, brother, that
j means through.
Apparently somebody else had the same idea, and
; so recently they upped and sounded the cry for "more
i fun on less dollars." A sound idea.
j Now, this isn't authoritative, because as yet no au
i thority has blossomed into print with anything defi-
I nite, but it is going around that Cardinals is planning
j to throw a musical get-together come this New Year's
I Eve.
The hearsay details report that they are looking for
I a likely country club, or a reasonable facsimile, some
i where in the neighborhood of LA. or the Bowl city.

IF THIS is the straight goods, you had better start
j thanking Cardinals right now. Such an idea would
! probably be right down the Stanford students' alley.
| That is, of course, unless you don't care where your
j money goes, which would place you among the favored
| few.
| Just a hasty, conversational check-up of all the
Stanfordites within calling distance indicates that
j about everyone and his mother's cousins are going to
| be in Los Angeles come this "'appy, 'appy New Year."
Even at say $5 a couple at such a dance, that would
be saving every Stanford male about $15 or $20 apiece.
And suppose just 500 couples of our over 4000 stu
dents attended. That would be $2500. You can almost
buy Glen Miller's band for $1500; it wouldn't cost
$1000 to rent the joint.
So if Cardinals springs this idea, why don't some
; of you people come right out and say that you like
j their idea for saving money. If you let campus or-
I ganizations know what you want, they are usually
pretty quick to oblige.
