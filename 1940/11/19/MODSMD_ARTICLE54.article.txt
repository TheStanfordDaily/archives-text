## AS OUR SYMBOL 
### 
THE EDITOR, SIR:
I feel that I must protest against certain actions
of the Stanford yell leader last Saturday afternoon.
Such sentences as "A six for the Oregon State um
pire," "Wonder why the Oregon State rooters came
up." and "Oregon State High School is not through
yet." are not indicative of a sportsmanlike spirit. The
officials are trying to do a good job and deserve our
support and the Oregon team and rooters as our guests
should be treated with as much courtesy as possible.
In summing up, I wish to say that I do not believe
the yell leader's exhibition was a manifestation of the
true Stanford spirit.
A Stanford Student
P.S.: It must be remembered that the yell leader
is the symbol of Stanford students and therefore re
sponsible to them for any action which he makes in
! the course of his work.
