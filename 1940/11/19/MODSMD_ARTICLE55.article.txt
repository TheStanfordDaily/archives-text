# THE 						B.A.C. AGAIN
## 
### 
r FHE EDITOR. SIR:
" I wish to call attention to the injustice caused
I by the commercialism and greed of the B.A.C. to
j members of the student body in which said members
i are denied their primary right of seeing the Big
Game.
We are students. We have paid huge fees for (he
privilege of being students. The team is our team. We
i have the right to watch that team play and the B.A.C.
| should not be allowed to deny us this light to satisfy
1 their greed for that $4.40. These students are willing
! to pay $1.65 for their tickets. True, they had their
privilege of buying thfcse tickets if they wished and
J they failed to. But they may have justifiable reasons
j for not doing so at the time. They may have been
| sick and thus not in a position to buy them.
| Further, the sale is only for two days and it comes
so early in the year. One cannot know if he will be
I able to attend. Whatever the reason is it is imma
terial. These students should be allowed to buy
tickets if they so desire right up to the day of the
game. Say the student body is 4000. It would not injure
the B.A.C. to hold open 4000 seats on the 50-yard line
until the day of the game. If all of them are not pur
i chased they can easily be sold just before the game.
For this very reason thef"B.A.C. has no right to
; keep us from the game. We must remember the
j B.A.C. and the alumni exist for the benefit of the
; students. Their rights are secondary to those of the
| students and should give way when there is a con
flict between these rights.
I ask and demand that the students' primary rights
. be enforced; that the B.A.C. be forced to sell tickets
to all bona fide registered students who desire to
attend the Biii Game. If. in the SO.OOO seats in the
Memorial Stadium there are not enough to satisfy stu
dents and alumni, let's make the alumni stay home and
i not the students,
