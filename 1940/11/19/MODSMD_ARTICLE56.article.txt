# Fox Features Gary Cooper, Fightin' Men
## 
### 
THE WESTERNER." now play
ing at the Fox Stanford Theater.
A few "fightin'" words, lots of
dirty cowboys, a combination "sa
loon-courtroom" and The Westerner
is under way. The old, languid, fun
ny attitude of Gary Cooper is dis
guised in a plaid shirt and ushered
in on a stolen horse—but neverthe
less it is present and just as hu
morous.
A real lady of the plains is the
independent little spitfire who is
fighting for the rights of the agrarian
population against the cattle-raisers
in a land where there is not room
enough for both. In her spare time
she concentrates her charms on
Gary Cooper.

Judge Roy Bean, played by Wal
j tor Brennan, monopolizes many of
! the best scenes in a very entertain
' ing manner. Sole instigator of the
j law, he passes death sentences for
I th« fun of attending the public
hangings.
He is crude, merciless, stubborn,
' and stupid, but he has a weakness.
Said weakness is a lifelong adoration
and worship of none other than the
far-famed Lily Langtry. This ro
mantic set-up is a source of humor
throughout the entire play until the
Judge's last scene, when a tear
jerking incident drags pity from even
j the most unemotional show-goer.
HOT STUFF
A ravishing fire that sweeps across
I the crops and destroys every house
I and bam in its path is a marvelous
j piece of photography, and is as real
| a fire as has ever been produced in
a western.
It isn't a riotous comedy; nor is it
a heavy tragedy. It's just good clean
fun with a few sober moments—and
what a role for Gary Cooper! Fan
or no, you'll like him.—Brinkman
The first record of the cultivation
of sweet peas was in 1699, when

THE WESTERNER." now play
ing at the Fox Stanford Theater.
A few "fightin'" words, lots of
dirty cowboys, a combination "sa
loon-courtroom" and The Westerner
is under way. The old, languid, fun
ny attitude of Gary Cooper is dis
guised in a plaid shirt and ushered
in on a stolen horse—but neverthe
less it is present and just as hu
morous.
A real lady of the plains is the
independent little spitfire who is
fighting for the rights of the agrarian
population against the cattle-raisers
in a land where there is not room
enough for both. In her spare time
she concentrates her charms on
Gary Cooper.
BRENNAN GRABS
Judge Roy Bean, played by Wal
j tor Brennan, monopolizes many of
! the best scenes in a very entertain
' ing manner. Sole instigator of the
j law, he passes death sentences for
I th« fun of attending the public
hangings.
He is crude, merciless, stubborn,
' and stupid, but he has a weakness.
Said weakness is a lifelong adoration
and worship of none other than the
far-famed Lily Langtry. This ro
mantic set-up is a source of humor
throughout the entire play until the
Judge's last scene, when a tear
jerking incident drags pity from even
j the most unemotional show-goer.
HOT STUFF
A ravishing fire that sweeps across
I the crops and destroys every house
I and bam in its path is a marvelous
j piece of photography, and is as real
| a fire as has ever been produced in
a western.
It isn't a riotous comedy; nor is it
a heavy tragedy. It's just good clean
fun with a few sober moments—and
what a role for Gary Cooper! Fan
