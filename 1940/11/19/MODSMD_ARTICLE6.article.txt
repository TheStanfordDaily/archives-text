# Men's Council Wiggles Finger, Lays That Law
## 
### 
Explanation of parking and traffic
regulations on the road encircling
the inner Quad was made by Men's
Council yesterday following an un
usual number of parking citations
within that area.
The chains at Engineering Corner
and Physics Corner which normally
block automobile passage are re
moved and free traffic permitted
over the week-end. No automobile
passage or parking along that road
is permitted during week days ex
cept for emergencies.
CHAIN TROUBLE
Men's Council pointed out that
unless the chains and posts which
block the roadway are completely
taken down, passage is not permit
ted to the general public. SeveraJ
violations occurred during the past
week when one of the chains was
temporarily dropped.
Several traffic parking violations
occurred in the no-parking area in
the driveway in front of Branner.
It was pointed out at the meeting
that this was made a no-parking
area several years ago in response
to such a request from residents of
the hall.
BETTER COME
With no other than traffic cases
on the week's docket, the meeting
closed with a warning to traffic vio
lators to appear at meetings upon
schedule. Failure to appear, or to
notify a member of Council, may
result in an increased fine.
