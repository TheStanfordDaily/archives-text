### BOB LOW 
officials yesterday began to
talk for the first time about the
diplomatic negotiations being car
ried on by Reichsfuehrer Adolf j
Hitler.
According {o high Nazi sources,
the present conversations will re- I
suit in the creation of a gigantic j
coalition hostile to Great Britain.
Hitler has already conferred with
Spanish Foreign Minister Ramon j
Serrano Suner and with King Boris j
of Bulgaria. Tomorrow he will meet
with diplomatic representatives of j
Hungary.
Spain, Hungary, and Bulgaria to
date have not officially joined hands
with the Axis, but all three have
been outwardly sympathetic in their
attitude.
The Spanish government has not
forgotten vital German and Italian
aid during the bitterly fought
civil war and up to this point she
has not repaid Italy or Germany.
In fact, Germany's adaptation of
the "continental system" has suf
fered by Spain's neutrality, for
Great Britain can still trade with
Europe through Spain.
Evidence of the extent of this
trade is the tremendous quantity of
Spanish wines that appear on the
American market, imported through
British liquor exporting firms.
Hungary long has been looked
upon as the bread basket of Europe.
With German troops lining her bor
ders, Hungary will have to accede
to Nazi demands in order to retain
her territorial integrity. In addition,
the Hungarian government — a vir
tual dictatorship—is sympathetic to
ib<> dictatorial regime of the Third
Reich.
* * *
XJITLER might very well like to
dictate to Hungary terms iden
tical with those he dictated to Yugo
slavia several weeks ago. Under
that agreement, Germany secured
the right to all food surpluses pro
duced in Yugoslavia with the un
derstanding that the Yugoslav gov
ernment would encourage agricul
ture at the expense of industrial ac
tivity. Such a pact would make
possible a more favorable exchange
by Germany of industrial items in
return for foodstuffs.
Hitler would like such terms
with another country — this time
Hungary.
Bulgaria has been a friend of
Germany since her alliance with
the central powers in World War
I. Bulgaria, and Hungary, too,
lost territory by the Treaty of
Versailles. Neither of these coun
tries has last faith in Germany
and only through German aid or
acquiescence can they regain that
territory.
These three countires are, and
have been, in' the Nazi camp.
In the past few weeks. Hitler has
spoken to ranking diplomats of
France, Italy, and Russia. These
meetings, according to Nazi spokes
men, ended the first stage of the
"new Europe" plan. The present
conversations, they say, are the be
ginning of a working out of the
plans agreed upon in the earlier
discussions.

while Nazi officials yesterday
began to talk for the first time
about the diplomatic negotiations
being carried on by Hitler, it is ob
vious that "disclosures" in Berlin
actually revealed nothing unknown
to the outside observer. What is
likely is that Hitler in the near fu
ture will take some steps to make
his Berlin-Bagdad dream a reality.
Spain is rich in minerals; Hun
gary is rich in foodstuffs, and Bul
garia, likewise, is primarily an agri
cultural nation.
These agreements will assure
to Germany resources which,
when combined with those already
available, will make a strenuous
drive to the east more possible by
adding to Nazi strength and
morale.
That Berlin announces that Ger
many dominates the European con
tinent is not news; but the consoli
dation of these nations under the
Reich will make her next, move—a
drive to the East—the easier.

officials yesterday began to
talk for the first time about the
diplomatic negotiations being car
ried on by Reichsfuehrer Adolf j
Hitler.
According {o high Nazi sources,
the present conversations will re- I
suit in the creation of a gigantic j
coalition hostile to Great Britain.
Hitler has already conferred with
Spanish Foreign Minister Ramon j
Serrano Suner and with King Boris j
of Bulgaria. Tomorrow he will meet
with diplomatic representatives of j
Hungary.
Spain, Hungary, and Bulgaria to
date have not officially joined hands
with the Axis, but all three have
been outwardly sympathetic in their
attitude.
The Spanish government has not
forgotten vital German and Italian
aid during the bitterly fought
civil war and up to this point she
has not repaid Italy or Germany.
In fact, Germany's adaptation of
the "continental system" has suf
fered by Spain's neutrality, for
Great Britain can still trade with
Europe through Spain.
Evidence of the extent of this
trade is the tremendous quantity of
Spanish wines that appear on the
American market, imported through
British liquor exporting firms.
Hungary long has been looked
upon as the bread basket of Europe.
With German troops lining her bor
ders, Hungary will have to accede
to Nazi demands in order to retain
her territorial integrity. In addition,
the Hungarian government — a vir
tual dictatorship—is sympathetic to
ib<> dictatorial regime of the Third
Reich.

XJITLER might very well like to
dictate to Hungary terms iden
tical with those he dictated to Yugo
slavia several weeks ago. Under
that agreement, Germany secured
the right to all food surpluses pro
duced in Yugoslavia with the un
derstanding that the Yugoslav gov
ernment would encourage agricul
ture at the expense of industrial ac
tivity. Such a pact would make
possible a more favorable exchange
by Germany of industrial items in
return for foodstuffs.
Hitler would like such terms
with another country — this time
Hungary.
Bulgaria has been a friend of
Germany since her alliance with
the central powers in World War
I. Bulgaria, and Hungary, too,
lost territory by the Treaty of
Versailles. Neither of these coun
tries has last faith in Germany
and only through German aid or
acquiescence can they regain that
territory.
These three countires are, and
have been, in' the Nazi camp.
In the past few weeks. Hitler has
spoken to ranking diplomats of
France, Italy, and Russia. These
meetings, according to Nazi spokes
men, ended the first stage of the
"new Europe" plan. The present
conversations, they say, are the be
ginning of a working out of the
plans agreed upon in the earlier
discussions.

while Nazi officials yesterday
began to talk for the first time
about the diplomatic negotiations
being carried on by Hitler, it is ob
vious that "disclosures" in Berlin
actually revealed nothing unknown
to the outside observer. What is
likely is that Hitler in the near fu
ture will take some steps to make
his Berlin-Bagdad dream a reality.
Spain is rich in minerals; Hun
gary is rich in foodstuffs, and Bul
garia, likewise, is primarily an agri
cultural nation.
