# Ducats Sell For Game Celebration
## Stanfordites to Play At Post-Big Game Semi-Formal Dance 
### 
Stanford's second annual Big
Game Dance is going to go over \
with a bang this year, taking pre- I
vious indications as a yardstick.
Last year 700 Stanfordites packed j
the dance to capacity under the fol- j
lowing conditions:
A victory-less football team, a'
last-minute decision to hold the j
dance, for the first time in the '
school's history, and bids at $5.
BOUND FOR SUCCESS
However, all these conditions have
been reversed this year—a Rose
Bowl-bound team, no chance of
losing the game, all arrangements
for the dance completed early, in
cluding Freddy Nagel and his Stan
ford orchestra, a Big Game dance
tradition already started, and price
of bids reduced to $3.
Chairman Bob Beckham pointed
out, however, that the reduction in
price will not mean a reduction in
the quality of the dance. There will
be plenty of free parking space; and
arrangements have been made with
the San Francisco Golf and Coun
try Club, locale of the dance, to
open two lounge and dressing rooms
where any students attending the
dance may change their clothes.
It has been arranged to have
dancing in three large rooms and an
outdoor patio. For tired rooters
there will be numerous overstuffed
chairs and couches. Also a bar —
well-stocked with cokes.
FROM 10 TO 2
The dance will last from 10 until
2 o'clock. The country club is at
Ingleside in San Francisco on U. S.
101 south of Sloat Boulevard. Wom
en's 2:30 late leaves will be extended
to 3:3o's for the occasion. Bids are
on sale now at the A.S.S.U. office.
Nagel's band started its starry
career several years ago playing for
Farm Gaieties and Spring Shows.
The band, which has stayed together
since then playing numerous en
gagements at meccas for discrimi
nating dancers throughout the West,
still retains its collegiate atmos
phere.
Nagel's musical library Ls famous
for its many peppy and danceable
arrangements of famous and popular
college songs,'and it is promised that
he will flavor his program at the
Big Game Dance with a liberal
I sprinkling of same.
