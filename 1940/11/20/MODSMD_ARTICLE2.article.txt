### M. J. MONTGOMERY 
"Anybody but McPherson will
touch off the Big Game Bonfire,"
Bruce Jessup assured student body
representatives at Ex Committee
last night after they unanimously
expressed vehement campus opinion
"opposed."
Jessup expressed his intention to
do everything else to further
friendly relations between Stan
ford and Cal during Big Game ri
valry. But, threatened by forces
organized in Encina and Sequoia
"forcibly to prevent" John McPher
son, Cal's president, from touching
a match to the Golden Bear's fu
neral pyre in the Lagunita lake-bed,
Stanford's A.S.S.U. head declared
neither president would risk the
"arson."
"It would be like letting the Stan
ford captain make the first touch
down for Cal," said Sylvia Berry to
settle the question.

pressed doubt as to the need for
such a dance in view of competi
tive entertainment offered New

Bruce Jessup assured student body
representatives at Ex Committee
last night after they unanimously
expressed vehement campus opinion
"opposed."
Jessup expressed his intention to
do everything else to further
friendly relations between Stan
ford and Cal during Big Game ri
valry. But, threatened by forces
organized in Encina and Sequoia
"forcibly to prevent" John McPher
son, Cal's president, from touching
a match to the Golden Bear's fu
neral pyre in the Lagunita lake-bed,
Stanford's A.S.S.U. head declared
neither president would risk the

down for Cal," said Sylvia Berry to
settle the question.
