BERLIN, Wednesday, Nov. 20 (UP). —Hundreds of German planes
blasted the great British industrial eity of Birmingham with thou*and.i
of bomhs during the night in an attack "equaling or possibly surpassing"
the destruction of Coventry last week. Nazi spokesmen said today.
Munitions works and military factories in Birmingham were bombed

with unusual success," German
quarters said. A clear night aided
the German raiders, they added.
Duration of the attack on th<» city
of more than 1,000,000 population
was not known.
Sweeping in over Birmingham in
waves, the German bombers loosed
their thousands of explosives and
started great fires, it was Eaid.
After the first wave of bombers
attacked, informants said, "twenty
huge fires leaped up and cast a glare
over the entire city, facilitating thf
orientation of subsequent waves."

Nazi spokesmen said the defences
of the Midlands city, which i* 11."?
miles northwest of London and a
great railway center, were "ineffec
tual" against the German bomber?;
battering at Birmingham hour after
hour.
It was the west Midlands town's
worst attack of the war. Early today
high explosive and incendiary bomb*
still showered down on it, blasting
apart and setting fire to an ever
growing number of houses, shops
and buildings of every sort.
Authorities, admitting heavy prop
erty damage already had been
caused, claimed the bulk of it was
to civilian property and damage to
industrial buildings was relatively
small.
CAPITAL BOMBED
Other targets in the Midlands
also were being bombed. Casualties
were feared at two Midlands towns
and some small country districts.
Victims were believed trapped in
two localities.
All reports to London indicated
the raiders, sweeping over the east
coast in greater numbers than have
been heard lately, were ferrying
their heaviest loads of explosives to
the Midlands, where last Thursday
night they struck the hardest air
blow of the war at Coventry.
The usual post-midnight lull in
London was lacking early today.
The anti-aircraft batteries around
the metropolitan area kept up their
barrage, with single raiders or small
groups breaking through at brief in
tervals to make bombing runs across
the capital.
ENEMY PLANE DOWN
Raiders were reported over Liver
pool three times, but officials naid
they only dropped incendiary bomb*
on the outskirts.
An enemy plane, a Heinkel 11!
bomber, crashed in flame;; in the
marshes near Barking. Five crow
men were trapped and killed.
Another raider was shot down in
flames near Nuneaton, Warwick
shire. The crew escaped by para
chute. One was captured and an
other was believed at large.
