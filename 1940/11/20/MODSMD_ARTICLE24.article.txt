# House Balks At Sine Die Resolution
## Opposing Democrats Support Republican Leader Joe Martin 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 19 (UP).—
Insurgent House Democrats teamed
up with a solid Republican minority
today to defeat leadership plans for
sine die adjournment of Congress.
The unexpected reverse came on
an adjournment resolution intro
duced by Democratic Leader John
MeCormack. The vote was 191 to
3-18.
McCormack and Speaker Sam
Rayburn were caught napping. They
appeared stuned and were at a loss
to explain why the Democrats de-
M i ted to support Republican Leader
Joseph Martin.
NO SINE DIE
liny burn said immediately there
would be no further effort to ad
journ sine die for some time. Sen
ate Majority Leader Alben W. Bark
ley recessed his chamber with the
statement "adjournment is a dead
issue." He commented wryly a good
many Republicans probably are cha
grined "because they wanted to have
I heir cake and eat it too."
He apparently was referring to
what some Democrats described as
Republican determination to oppose
a< journment "merely for the sake
ol the record" and with the fore
knowledge they would be defeated.
They were victorious, however.
!v..PS STICKING
Republicans in both chambers
h; ve steadfastly opposed prolonged
adjournment during the war emer
gr ncy. With the aid of conservative
D< mocrats they forced Congress to
i< nain in session last summer after
President Roosevelt said he saw no
reason why it should not quit.
In the months that followed the
Conscription Bill and millions of
dollars in defense appropriations
were passed.
'i*he Republican leadership ap
pr. ently took its cue from Wen
cU II L. Willkie, defeated G.O.P.
Pi 'sidential nominee, who only yes
l' day reiterated both chambers
• h >uld stay on the job until the
n< v Congress meets on Jan. 3.
