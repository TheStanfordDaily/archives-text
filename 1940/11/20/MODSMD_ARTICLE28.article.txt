# Lillien Martin Helps Oldsters Find New Life After Fifty
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Probably any scond-generation Stanfordite could get a complete dossier
on Dr. Lillien Martin from bis parents. Sbe taught psychology here until
she retired about two decades ago, and a darn good professor she was.
according to extant evidence.
All I)r. Martin should be today, according to the accepted ideas about
old age, is a white-haired old lady busy knitting tea cosies, content with

her memories. But Dr. Martin
never one to take things the easy ,
way, and today at the age of 88 ;
she is busy giving interests and new [
life to hundreds of forgotten, un
happy old people through her Old
Age Center in San Francisco.
Dr. Martii, after she became
emeritus, established what was
probably the first child guidance
clinic in America. One clay a re
port concerning a 12-year-old neu
rotic came to her attention. The
child was being bullied by his "fat
uous" grandfather.. The report con
cluded: "The problem is: How to
scrap the old man." On the margin
she scribbled the remark: "Not scrap
—salvage."
REMEDY—ACTIVITY
From this grew the Old Age Cen
ter. Psychologist Matrin saw that
men and women over 50 are often
victims of their own fears and feel
ings of insecurity. Thus they tend
to resist change, become self-cen
tered and obstinate. Her remedy is
simple—activity.
"When yom" body moves, .so does
your mind," she says.
Perhaps the most spectacular ex
ample ol the Martin methods ef
fectiveness is the lady herself. It
took her 50 hours of driving les
| sons, but she still learned to drive
|at the age of 76. Since then she's
, driven across the continent six
times.
TWO TRIPS
She has made two trips around
j the world studying social and in-
I dustrial conditions during her trav
i els, and a year ago she took a 20,000-
! mi'e junket through South America,
j jungles and all. She prepared for
the South American tour by learn
ing Spanish and typing.
This dynamic woman believes
firmly that the "over 50" segment
of the population has a great deal
to contribute to society, and that
their tremendous "reservoir of tal
ent and energy should be conserved
I and utilized."

According to records, more than
10 per ccnt of till fire alarms in the
United States arc for automobile
fires.
