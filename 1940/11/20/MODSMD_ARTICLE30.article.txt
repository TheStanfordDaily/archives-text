ATLANTIC CITY, N.J.. Nov. 19 "
UP). —John L. Lewis, who is retir- g
ng as president of the Congress of j C
ndustrial Organizations, tonight , d
'irtually called on peace-seeking c '
inions to quit the CIO. I v
The CIO convention followed him i
vith unanimous adoption of a reso- s
ution which directed CIO negotia-
ors to stand pat for labor peace pre- j
equisites which the American Fed- ! [
nation of Labor has long held out c
igainst. The resolution offered no ; I
aeace overtures to the AFL. J
Lewis spoke at a session which J
'ollowea onq in which Philip Mur- j
ray, CIO vice-president who was j
he choice of right and left-wing
CIO factions to succeed Lewis in |
;he presidency, had announced that ;
he was not a candidate for the office, i
Murray refused to say whether he !
would accept a draft to the presi- ;
dency and it was assumed that an j
attempt would be made to draft
him.
NO AFL PEACE
There can be no "honorable
peace" with the AFL, Lewis thun- j
dered, until the CIO is strong I
enough to bargain on "equal terms." i
Amid thunderous applause, Lewis
rejected suggestions of the amalga
mated Clothing Workers Union
that "exploratory" negotiations be
resumed with the AFL committee. |
He asserted it would be "a shame j
and a waste of time to raise the
hopes of millions of people in this
country by making it appear there j
is any possibility of peace."
He extended a virtual invitation j
to quit to the Amalgamated Cloth
ing Workers of America and the ;
United Textile Workers Union as he
named former CIO leaders — Presi
dent David Dubinsky of the Inter
national Ladies Garment Workers
Union and President Max Zaritsky j
of the United Hatters, Cap and Mil
linery Workers Union—as having
pledged fealty "by book, bell and
candle" v/hen the CIO began its !
struggle but "wearied of the fight." j
"THE EASY WAY" x
"Dubinsky took the easy way," J
Lewis continued. "Zaritsky took the I
easy way.
"If anybody else in the CIO wants j
to take the easy way, then in God's ;
name take it."
His fiery speech to the CIO con- i
vention closed labor peace debate, 1
and the convention unanimously |
continued its peace committee, in
structing it to insist upon simulta
neous admission of all CIO unions ;
without jurisdictional surrenders
into any united labor movement, j
