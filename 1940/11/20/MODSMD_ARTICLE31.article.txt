## 
### 
The Alumni Conference Commit- [
tee decided at its meeting last week '
that the annual Alumni Conference
would be held on the Stanford cam
pus Feb. 8 and 9, 1941. Other con
ferences are to be held in Los Ange
les, San Diego, Seattle, and Port
land, but the dates for these are not j
yet decided.
The conference will be a two-day
affair, consisting of several discus
sions, topped off with a banquet on j
Sunday evening. Although the pro- j
gram is not definitely set, Jack
Shoup, chairman of the Conference i
Committee, announced that a panel i
discussion on the question "Where
does America go from hero?" is
planned for Saturday, Feb. 8. It
will take up tlie foreign and inter
nal policies of the United States ;
separately. Professor Thomas A.
Bailey of the History Department
will act as chairman, assisted by
Philip W. Buck, associate professor
in political science. Mr. Buck was |
chairman of the panel discussion
last year.

On Sunday, Jan. 9, then* will be
three discussion periods, each of
which will include three individual
groups. Possible topics for these dis
cussions were considered by the
committee last night, but no definite
subjects were chosen. They will
include, however, topics about the
j University as well as questions of
general interest. Heretofore these
| discussions have not included sub
' jects peculiar to Stanford.
| Dr. Wilbur will be the principal
speaker of the conference, acting
as guest speaker at the closing ban
. quet Sunday evening,,
The affair is sponsored by the
Alumni Association and has been
j held annually for the last eight
j years. It is actively participated in
' by the Stanford faculty. Last year
Ralph H. Lutz, professor of history,
highlighted the conference, with his
| own predictions regarding the Eu
[ ropean war.
A large attendance is expected at
this conference, since interest in all
; alumni functions has increased no-
I tably this year.
