# Splashers Scuttle Cal, 6-4
## Last Minute Scores Met Indian Win 
### BOB CHANDLER 
Ltd l>y Dave Nottage and Fred
Manwaring, with three and two
goals. respectively, the Stanford
varsity water polo team pulled the
upset of the season yesterday after
noon when they defeated the league
leading California team by a score
of (i-4. A hectic last quarter saw
tv\<> Card tallies in the last minute
of play break a tie that had lasted
from the middle of the third quar
ter.
The Thorntonmen started scoring
early in the first quarter, when
Manwaring rang the bell on a tip
in shot after a beautiful pass from
Nottage. Shortly afterwards, Not
tage went out 011 a foul, but the
fighting Indians, playing with six
men, managed to stave off a Cal
score until early in the second
quarter when the Bears scored
twice in quick succession. Late in
ihe quarter Nottage came through
with his first goal of the day and
the half ended in a 2-2 tie.
INDIANS LEAD
Early in the third period Mitchell
dribbled all the way in and scored,
giving Stanford a 3-2 lead which
they hold until late in the period,
when Perry Lamb turned a blocked
pass into a Cal score, and another
quick tally put the Bears in Ihe
lead.
The beginning of the fourth quar
ter saw Nottage scoring again after
a beautili'! bit of teamwork that
Ifc'fi aim with a clear shot at the goal
from about 10 feet out. With about
40 seconds remaining Nottage was
again worked clear on the breaking
offense that the Indians employed,
and Manwaring broke loose in the
last 10 seconds of play to give the
Cards their sixth and final tally.
The exuberant Stanford squad im
mediately tossed Coach Nort Thorn
ton into the pool.
BRILLIANT TEAMWORK
The Indians played exceptionally
brilliant ball throughout the con
test, with every man on the team
turning a good game, both as a
team and by virtue of individual
play. Only one substitution, Hauer
wass for Fred Manwaring, was
used throughout the game, the rest
of the starting team remained intact
during the cor lost.
The Stanford line-up saw Bill
Weeden at the spring post, Dave Not
tage and Fred Manwaring at the for
ward spots, and Bob Jones, sopho
more transfer from Fullerton Junior
College, at centerback. Captain Ted
Moreno and Bob Mitchell started at
the guard positions while goalie Bob
Breckner turned in his usual bril
liant game in the cage. Jones,
Mitchell and Nottage showed par
ticularly well, while Breckner com
pletely outclassed Bear Captain
"Woody" Woodman in the goal.
The close guarding of the ace Cal
forward, Perry Lamb, by captain
Ted Moreno, had a great deal to do
with the final outcome, almost nulli
fying his scoring threats, while Don
Aronson also had a great deal of
trouble in shaking Mitchell loose.
PAPOOSES WIN, 7-.1
In what team members called "the
toughest game of the season," the
strong Stanford frosh, led by newly
elected Captain Bob Blatt. had very
little trouble in disposing of the
weak Cal frosh, a contest that saw
the Papooses winding up on the tall
end of a 7-3 score.
Closely guarded by the Cal guards,
Grant Culley contented himself
with feeding his team-mates, tally
ing only "once during the afternoon's
play. Carpenter, Bonner, and Lee
turned in games that will mark
them all for future varsity compe
tition. The scoring consisted of a
singleton by Culley, two goals from
Carpenter, two from the ace frosh
centerback, Bob Hind, and one each
from Captain Bob Blatt and Clark
Bonner. The game showed Peter
Lee to be one of the most outstand
ing goalies to have ever competed
under the yearling banner.
The varsity game brought out the
possibilities that the varsity has
?hown to its followers the whole
season, and at least postpones the
clinching of the pennant by Cal un
til Big Game day, when the teams
meet in the Berkeley pools on the
morning of the football game. At
present, Stanford has suffered three
defeats, which precludes it from
,my mathematical chance at the
coveted championship. Cal has lost
only one game and do no worse
than a tie for the championship,
while the two southern squads,
U.S.C. and U.C.L.A., must each win
both of their remaining games for a
tie, an impossibility, since they play
each other twice.
