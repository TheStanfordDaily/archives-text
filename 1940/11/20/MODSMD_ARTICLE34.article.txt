'T'HAT official's butch in the Cor
nell-Dartmouth game Saturday
will go down in sports annals along
side the Merkle boner and other
prize mistakes. *
And the alarrping aspect of the
whole thing is that it's the second
time in as many years that the ref
eree, in a major game, has gotten
balled up on the number of downs.
A somewhat similar situation
popped up in the Notre Dame-
Carnegie Tech game last year. The
ref again mistook the down, then
corrected himself, causing the En
gineers to lose the ball on downs.
That blew over, and the Cornell-
Dartmouth mixup was straightened
out when the Ithacans, more or less
extra-legally, gave the game to the
White Indians, but if officials de
cide to make a regular practice of
this, football is going to get very
confusing to player and spectator
alike.
Football powers that be will have
to work on a sure-fire scheme to
eliminate such happenings. It
seems gigantic scoreboards don't
make an impression on the type that
officiates at America's gridiron
spectacles. Neither does the downs
box.
Perhaps referees should be equip
ped with a four-leaf clover (real or
imitation) every time the ball
changes hands and after every first
down. Then he could remove a leaf
every time a play is run.
Or lie might he given a quartet
of silver dollars at similar inter
vals. and throw one into the
stands after each scrum. Thus
football c'Miid combine hank night
and bingo, and still have more ac
curate officiating.
Then again, some people believe
in changing the rules. They rea
son, "A third term for Roosevelt,
why not a fifth down for Cornell."

r |~ I HERE will now be a slight pause
for a oommercial (unpaid) an
nouncement.
Tickets for- the Big Game are
still on sale. At present some
GO.OfIO ducats have been sold, over
20,000 good seats remain. They
can be obtained at any of the Bay
Area ticket agencies and at the
athletic offices of Stanford and
California.
For those living outside the Bay
Area, the Stanford B.A.C. is still
taking mail and wire orders for
tickets.

AN encouraging report from Dr.
Fritz Roth, medical custodian of
the gridders, indicates that Norm
Standlee should be ready to go in
top form for the Big Game.
The Chief is scheduled to throw
away his crutches today, by
Thursday he should be able to do
a little mild running.
If everything goes O.K. Norm
might be able to rejoin the team for
real practice early next week, in
plenty of time to get back in good
shape before Saturday.
The Students' Guild was organized
in 1895 for the purpose of providing
for the care of the students in time
of sickness.

The Chief is scheduled to throw
away his crutches today, by
Thursday he should be able to do
a little mild running.
If everything goes O.K. Norm
might be able to rejoin the team for
real practice early next week, in
plenty of time to get back in good
shape before Saturday.
The Students' Guild was organized

'T'HAT official's butch in the Cor
nell-Dartmouth game Saturday
will go down in sports annals along
side the Merkle boner and other
prize mistakes. *
And the alarrping aspect of the
whole thing is that it's the second
time in as many years that the ref
eree, in a major game, has gotten
balled up on the number of downs.
A somewhat similar situation
popped up in the Notre Dame-
Carnegie Tech game last year. The
ref again mistook the down, then
corrected himself, causing the En
gineers to lose the ball on downs.
That blew over, and the Cornell-
Dartmouth mixup was straightened
out when the Ithacans, more or less
extra-legally, gave the game to the
White Indians, but if officials de
cide to make a regular practice of
this, football is going to get very
confusing to player and spectator
alike.
Football powers that be will have
to work on a sure-fire scheme to
eliminate such happenings. It
seems gigantic scoreboards don't
make an impression on the type that
officiates at America's gridiron
spectacles. Neither does the downs
box.
Perhaps referees should be equip
ped with a four-leaf clover (real or
imitation) every time the ball
changes hands and after every first
down. Then he could remove a leaf
every time a play is run.
Or lie might he given a quartet
of silver dollars at similar inter
vals. and throw one into the
stands after each scrum. Thus
football c'Miid combine hank night
and bingo, and still have more ac
curate officiating.
Then again, some people believe
in changing the rules. They rea
son, "A third term for Roosevelt,
why not a fifth down for Cornell."

r |~ I HERE will now be a slight pause
for a oommercial (unpaid) an
nouncement.
Tickets for- the Big Game are
still on sale. At present some
GO.OfIO ducats have been sold, over
20,000 good seats remain. They
can be obtained at any of the Bay
Area ticket agencies and at the
athletic offices of Stanford and
California.
For those living outside the Bay
Area, the Stanford B.A.C. is still
taking mail and wire orders for
tickets.
