# Frosh Cagers Drill for Marin
## 
### 
Beebs Lee got bis frosh basket
bailers together for the first time
last night and the resulting scrim
mage produced showed more fight
than an Indian rooting section af
ter one of those questionable deci
sions by the referee.
Of the 28 men still on ihe squad
j four teams squared oil to start things
i going, the other eight being sub
stituted at a moment's notice.
PREPARE FOR MARIN
In preparation for the Marin J.C.
; tussle December 2, most of the
j time last night went to general de
fensive play as "Scoop" Carlson's
Jaysee outfit has always been rated
high in its league, never having fin
i ished worse than second for the
j past two seasons.
On the other hand, Lee's teams
have beaten California in their an
nual three-game series for the last
two years and should go to town
again this year if he can keep his
men in the same place at the same
J time for practice sessions. Labs
make it nretty hard, so night prac
tices will be slated when possible.
