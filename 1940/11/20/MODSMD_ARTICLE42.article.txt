# Varsity Defeats Freshman Kickers
## 
### 
The Card frosh soccer squad took
a 3-0 defeat from a makeshift var
sity team yesterday afternoon as a
workout for their first major game
against the Berkeley Cubs.
The freshmen showed what Coach
Tcfvik Sadullah called "a 100 per
cent improvement" over their early
season form, in holding a team made
up of first and second string var
sity players to three goals.
