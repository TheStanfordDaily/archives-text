# Jenkins, Lello Battle Friday
## 
### 
NEW YORK. Nov. 1!) (UP).—The
lightweight title probably will
change hands Friday night when
Champion Lew Jenkins and Pete
Lello tangle at Madison Square
Garden. Moreover, it's one of those
rarely genuine "grudge fights." Yet
the bout threatens to be held in
virtual privacy.
In the good old days a lightweight
championship fight was one of the
year's outstanding sports events,
because the lightweights generally
have been ranked right next to the
heavies as the No. 2 money division.
Tho Jenkins - Lello lightweight
title brawl has crept up on, thp
public with virtually no fanfare or
publicity. This is singularly un
fortunate, both for Promoter Mike
•Jacobs and the fans—to say nothing
of the fighters. Because this sched
uled 15-round bout shapes up as a
mighty attractive melee.
LELLO DISLIKES CHAMP
Challenger Lello of Gary, Ind.,
dislikes Champion Jenkins so much
he has offered to fight him "for
nothing" in a gymnasium. Hence,
Lello, at least, will not be disap
pointed with Friday night's gate.
Lello is sore at Jenkins because
he knocked out Texas Lew in their
one and only meeting at Chicago in
May, 1939, but Jenkins never would
give him credit for the kayo. In
stead, according to Gary Pete, Jen
kins told everyone in New York the
Chicago officials had ganged up on
him and stopped the fight in the
ninth round because he was bleed
ing a bit from an old eye gash.
Such was not the case, according
to Lello.
HE CAN'T FIGHT'
Lello, a former Gary steel mill
worker of Polish-French parentage,
I admits honestly that Senor Jenkins
of Texas is a great puncher, "but
he can't fight."
Both Lello and Kline scoff at the
2-1 odds offered by New York
bookies, favoring Jenkins. Both are
, betting plenty on the fight.
Manager - Trainer - Second Kline
concludes, "Certainly I bet on fights,
; but only when I'm positive I'm put
ting my money on the winner,
This time I can't miss, because Pete
is good and mad at that prevari
cating Texan."
