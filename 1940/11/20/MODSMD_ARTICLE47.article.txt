THE steady stream of criticism denouncing
Stanford's Board of Athletic Control has as
sumed torrential proportions. Each successive
mail brings to this office a larger stack of Cam
pus Opinions condemning Board policies and
actions.
It is clear that they must be discussed. The
Board of Athletic Control has definitely side
stepped student opinion in enforcing its check
of student-body cards. Executive Committee de
cided that transference of cards was not an
honor code violation, though it clearly was not
a desirable procedure. In spite of this stand, the
Board has since consistently refused to take
any adequate steps to make transference im
possible.
Time after time it has been urged to use a
system of pictures or identification on student
body cards. And, too, on several occasions it
has assured student representatives that "check
ing of cardfe will not result in delays that will
keep rooters from seeing any part of the game."
Yet the treatment of Stanford men and women
by guards at the one small gate provided for
their use has resulted, time after time, in incon
venience and delay, often causing large groups
to miss the opening minutes of play.
If the Board again subjects Stanford students
to its particular brand of "inquisition" in the next
two games (assuming, of course, a Rose Bowl
bid), it will again be violating the wishes of
the majority of people who live on the Farm.
Furthermore, the Board's policy in relation to
sale of rooters' tickets has resulted in severe
criticism. The consensus holds that, for such
games as the Big Game and the Rose Bowl
game, as many tickets be made available to
students as there are students who wish to at
iend the games. There should be no restrictions.
Furthermore, adequate facilities and ample
time-limits should be provided. In the past root
ers have been forced to stand in lines that
stretched from the B.A.C. office to the street.
They have been obliged, too, to buy their tick
ets nearly two months before the game. And
they have been permitted only two days'in
which to purchase tickets.
No one doubts for a moment that athletics is
a big business. It is strange how, occasionally,
people forget that it is not such a big business
that it should be conducted to the detriment
of the students who, after all, make up the
important part of an undergraduate university.
Without students, college athletics could not
exist.
College sports began as a valuable means of
training men for life. If the emphasis has
changed so vastly that the original premise is
now discarded, the university, the individual,
and the sport have lost immeasurably.
The Board of Athletic Control has remained
stolid and unresponsive under the lash of stu
dent opinion for years. On Oct. 1, 1936, Daily
Editor Irv Jorgensen remarked that "again this
fall, the B.A.C. has heard growlings from stu
dents about the management of ticket sales."
A Campus Opinioner on Nov. 2, 1938, said,
"We shall never forget the slur of an over
handed administration." Two weeks later Asso
ciate Editor Harry Sheldon reported, "Excom's
sub-committee for investigation last night defi
nitely went on record in favor of cards with
pictures. . . . A1 Masters has agreed that this
is the best way to stop violations."
And last autumn Editor Larry Livingston said,
"Perhaps the past secretive actions of the B.A.C.
and its apparent lask of interest in undergradu
ate opinions have made the students feel that it
is not a real part of the University and therefore
unworthy of their respect and consideration.
"Whatever the cause, it is a certainty that

little love is l©st between the student body and
the 8.A.C."

sub-committee for investigation last night defi

And last autumn Editor Larry Livingston said,
"Perhaps the past secretive actions of the B.A.C.
and its apparent lask of interest in undergradu
ate opinions have made the students feel that it
is not a real part of the University and therefore
unworthy of their respect and consideration.
"Whatever the cause, it is a certainty that

THE steady stream of criticism denouncing
Stanford's Board of Athletic Control has as
sumed torrential proportions. Each successive
mail brings to this office a larger stack of Cam
pus Opinions condemning Board policies and
actions.
It is clear that they must be discussed. The
Board of Athletic Control has definitely side
stepped student opinion in enforcing its check
of student-body cards. Executive Committee de
cided that transference of cards was not an
honor code violation, though it clearly was not
a desirable procedure. In spite of this stand, the
Board has since consistently refused to take
any adequate steps to make transference im
possible.
Time after time it has been urged to use a
system of pictures or identification on student
body cards. And, too, on several occasions it
has assured student representatives that "check
ing of cardfe will not result in delays that will
keep rooters from seeing any part of the game."
Yet the treatment of Stanford men and women
by guards at the one small gate provided for
their use has resulted, time after time, in incon
venience and delay, often causing large groups
to miss the opening minutes of play.
If the Board again subjects Stanford students
to its particular brand of "inquisition" in the next
two games (assuming, of course, a Rose Bowl
bid), it will again be violating the wishes of
the majority of people who live on the Farm.
Furthermore, the Board's policy in relation to
sale of rooters' tickets has resulted in severe
criticism. The consensus holds that, for such
games as the Big Game and the Rose Bowl
game, as many tickets be made available to
students as there are students who wish to at
iend the games. There should be no restrictions.
Furthermore, adequate facilities and ample
time-limits should be provided. In the past root
ers have been forced to stand in lines that
stretched from the B.A.C. office to the street.
They have been obliged, too, to buy their tick
ets nearly two months before the game. And
they have been permitted only two days'in
which to purchase tickets.
No one doubts for a moment that athletics is
a big business. It is strange how, occasionally,
people forget that it is not such a big business
that it should be conducted to the detriment
of the students who, after all, make up the
important part of an undergraduate university.
Without students, college athletics could not
exist.
College sports began as a valuable means of
training men for life. If the emphasis has
changed so vastly that the original premise is
now discarded, the university, the individual,
and the sport have lost immeasurably.
The Board of Athletic Control has remained
stolid and unresponsive under the lash of stu
dent opinion for years. On Oct. 1, 1936, Daily
Editor Irv Jorgensen remarked that "again this
fall, the B.A.C. has heard growlings from stu
dents about the management of ticket sales."
