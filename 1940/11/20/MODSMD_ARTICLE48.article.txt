# BULL SESSION

DO IT TIIE I LARD WAY
IT doesn't take the big city papers any longer than a
rubber band in a snow storm to make fact out of
fancy. If So-and-so is just thinking of killing his
mother-in-law, why, by golly, by the late evening
edition he's up and killed her.
Well, yesterday the city papers in usual style
committed worse than murder. They came out as bare
faced as a Gillette razor advertisement with the state
ment that Stanford is going to light Cal's Big Game
bonfire; and, of course, since this is to be a reciprocal
trade agreement, the boys from Berkeley are going to
come panting down to the Lagunita lake bed, and
there, against a background of thousands of scream
ing Roble women, set our bonfire, outhouse and
all.

I N usual style, they jumped the gun. Nothing definite
on this subject has been decided upon. The word
from our leader, Bruce Jessup, says that the proposal
had just been given a conversational once-over lightly,
with a view to further action.
That action came last night. Since this column is
groaned into the journalistic world early in the after
noon, it is impossible here to state what action Ex
Committee took last night.
Let us hope at this point that they took the right
action. People, hundreds of people—not just the writer
of this column for the benefit of you hyper-conscien
tious Campus Opinion writers—have expressed the
hope that our Big Game bonfire tradition will not pass
by the boards.
A lot of guys will work awfully hax-d lor an aw
fully long time to build our bonfire next week, and
despite the fact that it will be in the name of "sweet
ness and light" (as the S.F. Examiner puts it), those
guys won't like it much if some Cal official in a tweed
suit walks forward and lights our "masterpiece" with
honey dipped matches.
The feeling would probably be the same at Cal.

|7ROM the point of view of the administration, how
ever, this little plan comes under the head of a
"good deal."
Every year the Big Game bonfire takes a lot of
guarding by Encina huskies. And there is nothing like
guarding a bonfire with the rung from one of Encina's
bannisters. They make the nicest crunching noise.
And every year, the Administration says, "No, no,"
and cites a few figures about the cost of replacing the
rungs that are wrenched out on the ran. And every
year, everybody seems to forget, and the day after the
bonfire the Encina carpenters are busier than a xylo
phone player four bars behind.

Maybe this is barking in the wrong vestibule. Let
us still hope that if Stanford lights Cal's bonfire this
year that they will still do it in the traditional way,
the hard way.
