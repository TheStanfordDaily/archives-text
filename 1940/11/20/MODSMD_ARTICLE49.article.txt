# CAMPUS OPINION
## BRIGHT OR DULL? 
### 
Y<HE EDITOR, SIR:
I see in Mr. Ames' column a rather obvious ex
ample of a school of thought which seems to be
gaining some support of late. This I will designate
"'Colorism." It looks down on the pitifully outmoded
conception that a football team is to be rated on its
ability to play football. After all, "it rilly isn't much
fun to watch a football game if there's nothing to see
but twenny-two (or is it twenny?) big men pushing
each other around, donch'thinkEunice?"
My dear Mr. Ames, I grant that football has passed
the "just for exercise" stage by a good margin. But
can you be serious when you say that a team like
Texas A. & M., which has reduced the appearance of
so many "colorful" teams and schools to something
resembling that dull material that one finds in puddles
after a rain, should be barred from playing brilliant
hued Stanford on the ground that it can't compete in
color? If that's the case then the hell with the foot
ball game. Let's just match color!
Very truly yours,
NOT an Okie
