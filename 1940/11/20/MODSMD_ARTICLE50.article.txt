# STANFORD DEMOCRACY?

### 
r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
If we are to judge the action taken by the
student body B.A.C. in checking the student body
cards, I would like to say that it is nothing short of
a stench of Fascism. I thought for a moment that I
was before the- tribunal of one of the high Fascist,
courts, what with questions as to my age, city, and
♦he other childish questions no other person would
think of. We pride ourselves in our democratic insti
tutions, but the B.A.C. conducts itself in a manner
which is too reminiscent of the Fascist countries. We
pay a goodly sum to attend Stanford, we are proud
of academic tolerance and freedom but we stop prid
ing ourselves when we point to her dictatorship-like
conduct of handling students at the game.
We are living in America, not Russia, Germany or
Italy. Perhaps the B.A.C. is not fully aware of this
fact.
We're tired, damned tired!
