EDITOR, SIR:
About Sim's suggestion the other day that some
plans be made for getting Stanford kids together in
L.A. I as an alumnus second it enthusiastically. It'd
be swell if we alumni and students could get together
for New Year's Eve at a reasonable rate. Look at the
success the Big Game Night made last year. How
about hiring a ballroom at some hotel?
