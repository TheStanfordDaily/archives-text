yiiE EDITOR, SIR:
Quite a while ago you printed a statement on
the costs involved in putting on card stunts at our
football games. You said some of the rooters, in fact,
a good number of them, wanted bigger and better, if
possible, stunts. It seems to me that the large majority
of the cost must be in purchasing the colored cards.
New cards must be purchased for every game, as
everyone joins the contest of seeing who can scale
his card the farthest. People have been hurt by sail
ing cards, but that is not my point. The point is that
if the majority of the student body really wants more
stunts, they should and probably would co-operate
and pass the cards to the sides of the rooting section
immediately after the show to be collected by the
Rally Committee for use at the next game.
This may have been tried before and it may not
have worked out, but how about letting Gordy use
his powers of persuasion and have him ask everyone
to co-operate the next time we have card stunts. It
can't be expetced to work at the Big Game, but there
is a good chance it might work at other games.
By this saving in cost we could probably afford to
buy enough cards for the girls' section to use, thereby
satisfying the Farmerette whose letter you printed
some days ago.
