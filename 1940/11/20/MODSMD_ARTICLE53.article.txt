"FOR WHOM THE BELL
TOLLS," by Ernest Hemingway.
Robert Jordan, a skilled blower
of bridges and an American volun
teer for Loyalist Spain in her Civil
War, is sent forth to add one more
notch to his gunstock—the bridge on
the road to La Granja. To blow a
bridge is a simple task, but to set
it off to coincide with some one
else's movements—well, that is an
entirely different matter.
And when one is beset with nu
merous complications in the plan,
one's experience makes a good
stoiy. This is precisely what Hem
uigway has done. His characters
are even more believable than in
"Farewell to Arms," an inevitable
comparison. Jordan himself is as be
lievable as any flesh and blood char
acter. He faces unusual situations
but he takes them on or falls be
foi'e them as one would expect him
to, knowing him as one does.
CHARACTERS FINE
But even more real and fine are
the people he is dealing with: An
selpo, the "old man who will live
until he dies," a quotation that
speaks paragraphs; Pablo, the fes
tering, gloomy Pablo, with his hate;
the admirable, sharp-tongued Pilar,
almost "stealing the show"; the
little Maria, cropped-haired, but
pretty. And, with others just as
good as these, they seem players of
a whole age, acting and reactmg on
one another in but three days. In
them Hemingway reaches depths he
has heretofore left unplumbed.
There is nothing humorous in this
book. There is no "comic relief"
(horrible phrase!). What lightness
there is has a grimness behind it, a
dismal cynicism, even the lazy gypsy
Rafael who "makes the joke" has a
hollow overcastness. The business of
the characters is seriously. In the
end they hope to win a cause; now
they must blow up a bridge as an
advance to that end. Living in our
part of the world, we, as yet, do not
realize the seriousness of this.
MAKES READER THINK
But on reading this book you

will gain at least an inkling of what
it is to fight for something you be
lieve in. Clifton Fadiman said of it,
"You are larger and more of a per
son on page 471 than you were on
page 1." We know that the cause in
Spain was lost, but the end was not,
and it is still being fought for. It
takes a great and capable writer to
catch all the fullness of the striving
for a cause. Hemingway did it.
Particularly interesting is the
technique of conversation. They all
speak in typical Spanish style, as if
directly translated. It has a beauti
ful and true effect. When you read
this book, watch for the many, many
bits of philosophy that lie hidden in
the conversations, practical and eye
opening. This book will not only
make you feel; it will make you
think.—Lucas

and it is still being fought for. It
takes a great and capable writer to
catch all the fullness of the striving
for a cause. Hemingway did it.
Particularly interesting is the
technique of conversation. They all
speak in typical Spanish style, as if
directly translated. It has a beauti
ful and true effect. When you read
this book, watch for the many, many
bits of philosophy that lie hidden in
the conversations, practical and eye
opening. This book will not only
make you feel; it will make you
think.—Lucas
"FOR WHOM THE BELL
TOLLS," by Ernest Hemingway.
Robert Jordan, a skilled blower
of bridges and an American volun
teer for Loyalist Spain in her Civil
War, is sent forth to add one more
notch to his gunstock—the bridge on
the road to La Granja. To blow a
bridge is a simple task, but to set
it off to coincide with some one
else's movements—well, that is an
entirely different matter.
And when one is beset with nu
merous complications in the plan,
one's experience makes a good
stoiy. This is precisely what Hem
uigway has done. His characters
are even more believable than in
"Farewell to Arms," an inevitable
comparison. Jordan himself is as be
lievable as any flesh and blood char
acter. He faces unusual situations
but he takes them on or falls be
foi'e them as one would expect him
to, knowing him as one does.
CHARACTERS FINE
But even more real and fine are
the people he is dealing with: An
selpo, the "old man who will live
until he dies," a quotation that
speaks paragraphs; Pablo, the fes
tering, gloomy Pablo, with his hate;
the admirable, sharp-tongued Pilar,
almost "stealing the show"; the
little Maria, cropped-haired, but
pretty. And, with others just as
good as these, they seem players of
a whole age, acting and reactmg on
one another in but three days. In
them Hemingway reaches depths he
has heretofore left unplumbed.
There is nothing humorous in this
book. There is no "comic relief"
(horrible phrase!). What lightness
there is has a grimness behind it, a
dismal cynicism, even the lazy gypsy
Rafael who "makes the joke" has a
hollow overcastness. The business of
the characters is seriously. In the
end they hope to win a cause; now
they must blow up a bridge as an
advance to that end. Living in our
part of the world, we, as yet, do not
realize the seriousness of this.
MAKES READER THINK
But on reading this book you

will gain at least an inkling of what
it is to fight for something you be
lieve in. Clifton Fadiman said of it,
"You are larger and more of a per
son on page 471 than you were on
page 1." We know that the cause in
Spain was lost, but the end was not,
and it is still being fought for. It
takes a great and capable writer to
catch all the fullness of the striving
for a cause. Hemingway did it.
