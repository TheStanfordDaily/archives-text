# Shoulder Dislocation Bars Cefaratti from '40 Gaieties
## 
### 
Tony Cefaratti, Ram's Head comedy star, will not be in the cast next
Friday when the curtain goes up on the 1940 version of Stanford's tradi- J
tional Big Game Gaieties, Director Harry Muheim announced last night, j
X-rays of a chronic shoulder dislocation have revealed that the rough- i
and-tumhlc activities required by his part might result in permanent in- !

Jury. Original plans had called for
Cefaratti to perform with a taped
shoulder, but the injury, sustained
as a result of a high school football
accident, has become aggravated in
the last few weeks, and Cefaratti,
acting under doctor's orders, will
not appear.
Since Cefaratti's appearance had i
been problematical from the begin- !
ning of rehearsals, Muheim said that
there will be no difficulty with last
minute fill-ins.
REHEARSALS SMOOTH
"Rehearsals are proceeding
smoothly," he added. "Of course
we're all about crazy, but that's an
occupational disease. The show'll go
on. It always does."
Adolfo Arias, dunce director, is
particularly pleased with the manner
in which his section of the show is
coming along.
"We're having a helluva time try
ing to forget jitterbuggingâ€”par
ticularly me," he said, "but they're
a wonderful group of dancers and
they have learned the most difficult,
intricate routine in the history of
the Gaieties in only two rehearsals."
COMBINATION ROUTINE
The "difficult" number is a rhum
ba-conga entitled, "May Mi Tia,"
translated as "Oh, My Aunt!" The
dance calls for a combination of
several different conga and l'humba
steps done by the different couples
at the same time.
The rhumba-conga is the second
I half of a huge night-club number.
The first part of the dance is a slow
j sophisticated routine done to Bill
j Quinn's "You're Such a Puzzle to
Me." Trick lighting arrangements
involving the use of ultra-violet and
costumes equipped with zippers, and
sliding panels will will facilitate the
quick change to "Hay Mi Tia."
ARIAS COMMENTS
"That black light is going to help
|in more ways than one," Arias
j commented.
I Finale for the first half of the
| show will be a spectacular presen
i tation called "Indo-Jive." In this a
huge drum will fill the center of the
stage with two ritual fires on each
side. The entire scene will be done
in red lighting effects. The dance
j starts in the Indian vein, shifts to
] a wild jive version of the same
| theme, and then returns to the orig
inal in a drive wind-up.
Arias was a little shaky about just
| what kind of Indians they were
i supposed to be.
"Arias's conception of Indians," he
! said.
