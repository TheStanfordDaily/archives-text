infantrymen, equipped to
fight in the mountainous Balkan
terrain, continued to push Italian in
vading forces back into Albania dur
ing the past week-end as Athens
boasted new victoires and Rome ad
mitted the surrender of Koritza.
What the Greek success will mean
in the long run is not known. Cer
tainly, Italy's tremendous advantage
in man-power and materiel will be
gin to tell when the Fascist legions
are reorganized, and Greece may find
herself in a bad way before that
should Germany decide to strike
from the north.
But the Greek victories may have
♦he immediate effect of bolstering
Turkish resistance to anticipated
Axis demands. According to neu
tral observers abroad, the British
have intentionally minimized the
extent of aid to Greece in order to
create the impression that the
Greeks alone are able to drive back
the much-touted Italian forces.
Such an impression would tend to
stiffen the resistance of nearby
Turkey.
In Turkey, martial law has been
declared for the European prov
inces and those in Asia Minor bor
dering 011 the Straits. This might
be an indication that Turkey is
preparing to resist a Nazi ultima
tum.

jy/JEANWHILE diplomatic pressure
x from Germany added two new
countries—Hungary and Rumania—
to the formal Axis alliance. The
news added little to the already es
tablished fact that the two coun
tries have been linked with the
Axis.
German troops occupied Rumania
several mnoths ago and the country
has been under direct Nazi-control
ever since. The announcement, then,
that Rumania joined the Axis
comes like a formal declaration of
an already established status.
Her government a dictatorship,
Hungary has been pro-Axis since the
outbx-eak of the war. Surrounded as
she is by Nazi armed might, Hun
gary could hardly stay out of the
formal agreement announced last
week.
An interesting note was cast on
the signing of the Hungarian alli
ance by the official news agency in
Russia. There it was declared that
the Soviet had not been notified of
the agreement prior to the signing, as
the German press claimed.
No further comment was made in
Moscow, but the possibility re
mained that she had not fully con
sented to the signing up of Hungary
—an action that might be a prelude
to a long-awaited Drang Nach
Ostcn.

pERHAPS the biggest news of the
week-end for Americans was
the announcement in New York by
Lord Lothian, British ambassador tc
the United States, that Great Brit
ain was "beginning to come to the
end of her financial l'esources."
That this statement reflected the
actual condition of British finances
was taken for granted in this coun
try. It was regarded as the inevi
table result of the mounting trenc
of British war needs in America.
American aid to Britain is de
pendent upon British purchasing
power in the U. S. Should this
purchasing power be exhausted,
America will he faced with the
question of giving material to
Britain or of curtailing entirely
further practical assistance.
Only if the United States is will
ing to accept repayment' of long
term loans in goods, aid to Britaii
could be continued. It is this Ameri
can policy that caused Britain t<
default on World War I debts.

A partial return by the CJO to th<
New Deal camp may be one resul
of the election of Philip Murray t<
the presidency of the union that, ha
been headed by John L. Lewis sinci
its inception. Murray was Lewis
personal candidate and they are ii
full agreement on policy. Howevci
Murray did not follow Lewis' sup
port of Wendell Willkie in the presi
dential race.
