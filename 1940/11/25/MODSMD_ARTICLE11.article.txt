Campus opinion shows that there '
Is no other way to spend the eve- |
ning and early hours of the morning
which offers so much in the way of
a good time as the A.S.S.U.'s own
Cardinal - sponsored Big Game
Dance.
Details on this year's affair which,
after last year's success, is well on
its way to becoming a Stanford
tradition:
Plact—San Francisco Golf and
Country Club at Ingleside on
U.S. 101, Junipero Serra Blvd.
Time—From 10 until 2 o'clock
of Saturday night and Sunday
morning.
Music—The smooth and refresh
ing rhythms of Freddy Nagel and
his orchestra.
Occasion — Stanford's glorious
victory-to-be over Cal and at
tendant return of "The Axe."
FREE BIDS
One of the added features which
will prove most attractive to those
who don't want to make the long
journey back to the Farm is the fact
that the club has arranged to have
two large lounges and dressing
rooms which will be open all eve
ning to those attending the dance,
who wish to attire themselves in
the appropriate semiformal garb.
Chairman Bob Beckham disclosed
yesterday that a surprise will be
pulled later this week in which a
couple of lucky Stanfordites will
receive free bids to the dance. If
they have already purchased bids
the price will be refunded to them
in full.
NAGEL TO PLAY
Freddy Nagel's music especially
for collegiate dancers will be wafted
via loudspeaker systems through
three spacious dancing rooms and an
outdoor patio.
Emphasizing the feature that this
is a dance for Stanford students
only, the committee was able to se
cure a real Stanford orchestra.
Nagel graduated from the Farm in
'30 and his band was originally
formed to play for campus musicals
such as the Gaieties and Spring
Shows. He has since played extended
engagements at Del Monte, the St.
Francis, the Wilshire Bowl,
"See you at the Big Game Dance"
has become a byword of Stanford
ites planning their post-game cele
brations for Saturday night.
