# Gaieties Reach Full Rehearsal
## Show in Good Shape For Friday Premiere 
### 
Gaieties players will be in dead
earnest this afternoon when they
don full makeup and mostume for
their first dress rehearsal. The
"dinner rehearsal" will last from
4 to 12 o'clock.
According to Director Harry Mu
heim, vacation rehearsals we're
very satisfactory, and the show is
in good shape. A production meet
ing was held during the week-end.
"We thought it was a good idea to
find out just how the show was
going to run," he said.
At this meeting all the music and
line cues were set, with an eye to
"keeping the show running at an
exhausting speed." Saturday morn
ing the complete show was rehearsed
in order, with the exception of a few
specialty acts which were in Los An
geles.
WIDE TUNE SELECTION
Tunes in the show will range from
the usual quota of romantic songs to
patter and satire lyrics.
"No Use" will be sung in a For
eign Legion setting by Brad Young
and Gerry Hughes. Miss Hughes is
the sole surviving member of the
Theta Trio which was originally
scheduled to accompany Young's
lament. Appearance of the other
two-thirds was canceled by ill
ness.
"The fact that it's in the Foreign
Legion is not too pertinent, but we
have to stage these things some
where," Muheim declared.
MOORE-HOWARD COMBINE
Tommy Howard and Barbara
Moore will join the Glee Club in
"Don't Be Romantic with Me," while
Brad Young and Gerry Hughes will
return to normal surroundings for
the sentimental "Hold Your Heart."
"Nothing New Under the Moon"
will be sung by Mary Merner on
that bridge, as previously an
nounced. Patty Bouchard will pre
sent "Men Are Mean" as her con-
I tribution to the bitter side of the
show.
Alcohol will enter the picture with
J "Tipsy Toper" sung by Ray Stahl
: and Olga Widmann, and "The Moon
i Is Up, the Top Is Down" will pre-
J sent Yvonne Hazlett and Tommy
Howard taking care of a romantic
i angle.' Hal Millen and Judy Pope
j will handle the song department in
j the combined song and dance,
i "You're Such a Puzzle to Me."
