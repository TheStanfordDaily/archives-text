some 500 gallons of oil and spray the
completed structure Thursday af
ternoon. Walt Heinecke, local Shell

works display at the Bonfire Thurs

gather combustible materials to fill
the huge framework. By arrange
ment with Dean Yost, the A.S.S.U.

rafters together in anticipation of
more yelling than has ever before
been heard in the old place since
the time of the Vow Boys.
