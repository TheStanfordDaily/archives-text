# Card Debating Team Ties For Third Place Honors In Pepperdine Tourney
## 
### 
Eight Stanford debaters returned home Thanksgiving Day from Los
Angeles, after participating in the four-day Western States Debate Tourna
ment, held at George Pepperdine College.
Those making the trip were Roger Boas (captain), Joe Morin, Jim Fro
lik, Irving Fine, Jim Kesslcr, and Jack Webster of the varsity, and two

debaters Allan Armer and
I Howard Ledeen.
Several hundred debaters from
I West Coast universities competed for
trophies awarded both the winning
debaters and the winning school.
U.S.C. once again carried away ma
jor honors, winning first place in 10
out of 15 divisions. Stanford's lower
division, four-man debate team of
Frolik, Fine, Kessler, and Webster
won their way to a tie for third out
of a field of 46 entered teams, emerg
ing with only two defeats.
U.S.C. won this event, with an un
defeated record, and College of Pa
cific and San Francisco State tied
for second with one defeat apiece.
The Stanford team was defeated by
U.S.C. and College of Pacific, Fine
and Frolik surprised the San Fran
cisco btate team, handing them their
only defeat in the tournament.
Jim Kessler, Rober Boas, and Jim
Frolik reached the semi-finals of
the impromptu speaking contests,
with Kessler going into the final
round. Kessler spoke on the topic,
"Our Refugee. Guests," but was
edged out by the speakers from
U.S.C., Pepperdine, and Los Angeles
City College.
Stanford lost a possible first place
when its after-dinner speaker, Roger
Boas, was barred from participa
tion in his specialty because his
tournament registration had not '
been sent in properly.
The freshman team of Allen Armer i
and Howard Ledeen reached the j
finals in the Class B division, but i
were eliminated by U.S.C. in the j
finals rounds.
The debaters represented Stanford
at the Western Association of Teach- j
ers of Speech Banquet following the i
tournament, at which the trophies i
were presented to winners in all I
divisions.
