## Athens Troops Push Deeper into Albania; Moscopole Captured 
### 
ATHENS, Mon., Nov. 25 (UP).—|
Greek troops smashing deeper into
Albania have captured the town of
Moscopole with 1500 Italian soldiers
and penetrated the outskirts of Pog
radec. Italy's No. 2 Albanian base on
the northern front, a war commu
nique reported today.
As the Grecian army continued to
advance along the whole 120-mile
front from the lonian Sea to the
Jugoslav border, it was announced
that British reinforcements —includ-
ing Royal Air Force pilots and
troops from New Zealand and
Cyprus—had arrived on the Greek
mainland.
MOSCOPOLE OCCUPIED
Greek soldiers and cavalry occu
pied Moscopole, 10 miles west of
Koritza, and Greek advance guards
at 11 a.m. yesterday penetrated the
outskirts of Pogradec, which is 22
miles north of Koritza, the com
munique said.
An official spokesman said that the
town of Pogradec is not yet com
pletely occupied by Greek forces but
"it is presumed it will be very
soon."
By taking Moscopole and pene
trating to Pogradec, the Greeks
broke through the Italian second
line of defense on the northern front
and appeared to have halted any at
tempt by the Fascists to reorganize
in that sector for a stand.
NEW FASCIST LINE
Pogradec is only 56 miles south
east of the Albanian capital of Ti
rana and is on the Shkumbi River
where 35 miles northwest it spreads
across Albania before turning south
toward Greece. It was believed that
the Italians might attempt to make
a strong stand there.
(Dispatches from Sofia, Bulgaria,
hinted that since the second de
fense line of the Italians in the
Pogradec sector appeared to be
crumbling, the Fascist forces will
attempt to construct a third line
River.)
In addition to taking Italian pris
oners at Moscopole during "mopping
up" operations in the Koritza sector,
the communique said that 12 guns,
mortars and other war materials
were captured by Greek forces.
Allied planes the communique
added, successfully bombed three-re
treating Italian columns in the
northern sector.
Official quarters said that the
Greeks were holding positions thus
far attained in the Argyrokastron
Valley, adding there were no new
developments on the southern front
to report.
BRITISH AID
British warships transported an
undisclosed number of troops across
the Mediterranean and landed them
at a Greek mainland port whex'e the
populace greeted them with en
thusiasm. The British reinforce
ments and equipment were unloaded
quickly. The troops lined up and
boarded buses for schoolhouses
where they were quartered for the
night.
A ministry of public security
communique said that no Italian air
raids were carried out Sunday on
the interior of Greece.
