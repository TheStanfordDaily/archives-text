# Chaplin Flays War Mongers In 'Dictator'
## 
### 
Writing, directing, and producing
a picture isn't enough for Charlie
Chaplin, just so that no one could
j overlook him he gave himself two
roles, and whistled up the tunes
that were used in the musical back
ground.
All tl.is makes Chaplin sound
j like something akin to a one-man
j baseball team, but with the differ
j ence that the result is a better-than -
| good show. Chaplin has for a long
I time been surrounded by a halo,
i and spoken of in hushed tones of
| awe—as a "great artist." But he is
i smart enough not to let art inter
| fere with entertainment.
PLOT PUSHED AROUND
In fact he lets the story wait in
| spots while he launches off on some
I typical bit of Chaplinesque whimsi
cality.
However, it's the sort of plot that
can be left to shift for itself. The
story, which makes no bones about
| being improbable, is about a little
i Jewish barber who is bounced on
his head in an airplane crash in
World War I, to return to his ghetto
shop twenty years later. Meanwhile
j the country (Tomania) has been
taken over by the dictator Adenoid
Hynkel (the parallel is obvious)
PLAYS DOUBLE ROLE
As the barber, Chaplin is him
self, the funny pathetic little guy,
always just two or three paces be
! hind the eight ball. As the dictator,
| he gives the most vitriolic satire on
; dictators yet recorded on celluloid,
j Chaplin recently declared that the
picture intended no offense, but as
! yet Hitler and Mussolini have not
recommended it as "just clean fun."
Because it isn't; its whimsical,
it's slapstick, it's fun, but its humor
is deadly. In fact it s just one more
proof that the most effective way of
: criticizing anything i.s to make fun
I of it.—Douglass
