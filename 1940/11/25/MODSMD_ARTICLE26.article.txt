# Tuesday Series Features Talk By Forester
## "Horatio Horn blower' Author Will Discuss Novel and Travels 
### 
C. S. Forester, famed English au-
Ihor, will speak tomorrow night at
7:30 o'clock for the Tuesday Series
in the Auditorium of the Memorial
Hall on "A Historical Novelist Liv
ing in History."
"Captain Horatio Hornblower,"
Forester's great trilogy of the sea in
the time of the Napoleonic wars, won
for him the James Tait Memorial
Prize for Literature, England's high
est literary award. It was also a
Book-of-the-Month selection and a
choice of The Book Society in Eng
land. Warner Brothers bought the
movie rights to the book and are
making a picture of it.
COLUMBUS TRAVELOGUE
"To the Indies," his current book,
which tells the story of Christopher
Columbus' third voyage to America,
has also been received with wide
spread enthusiasm from critics and
public. His other books include ''The
General," "The African Queen,"
"The Gun," "Payment Deferred,"
"The Happy Return," and others.
Forester was born in Cairo, Egypt,
son of an English officer. He was
sent to England to be educated. He
received a degree from Dulwich
College and later studied medicine
at Guy's Hospital in London. Medi
cine and a scientific education had
little appeal for him, for he was al
ready contributing verse to leading
English reviews and at the age of
22 he began writing novels.
SUCCESS STORY
He went through the*usual period
of privation and hardship, and his
early work received little recogni
tion. His first, successful novel was
"Payment Deferred," which he
dramatized with J. E. F. Dell in 1928.
It was this play which Charles
Laughton selected for. his first ap
pearance on the American stage, and
which was subsequently filmed to
give Laughton his first screen suc
cess .
The publication of "The General"
attracted widespread attention in
France and Germany as well as in
the United States. Forester's repu
tation is based not only on his sym
pathetic study of character, but also
on exact and careful historical re
search.
This gives special interest to his
recent book, "To the Indies," which
gives a graphic picture of the life
of Christopher Columbus and of the
great era of exploration which led
to the colonization of America.
