the aid of several doses of
bicarbonate, Thanksgiving tur
keys have been taken care of and
the time has just about come to start
whooping it up for the Big Game.
Before delving into traditions,
new plays, and the condition of
Norm Standlee's ankle, however,
it might he well to devote a little
more space to possibilities for a
Rose Bowl opponent. As The Daily I
ceases publication for the quarter
with the Big Game issue Friday, j
this will be the last crack we'll !
have at the subject.
With Pennsylvania's victory over
Cornell, another Rose Bowl eligible
has appeared. The Quakers, their
record marred only by a defeat at
the hands of mighty Michigan and a
tie with Harvard, thrust themselves
into the front ranks of bowl pre
tenders by slapping down the highly j
touted Big Red.
Michigan, on the same day, boost
ed the Quaker cause no little by
handling Ohio State, rated a strong,
though not a championship, team,
a sound lacing. Harmon & Co. were
able to defeat Pennsylvania by only
two touchdowns.
The prospect of a Penn-Stan- I
ford batle in the Hose Bowl j
pleases a lot of football fans who j
have felt that the East-West facet
of the classic has been badly ne- j
glected of late. Not since Lew j
Little's Columbia Lions defeated
the Vowing Sophs has a repre- j
sentative of what we really think j
of as the East been invited.
Bringing Penn out for the game
would revive interest in the Rose
Bowl game in a section of the coun
try which has begun to look on the
Pasadena bid as a southern mo
nopoly.

O* the other hand, an unde
feated opponent on New Year's j
Day would undoubtedly boost the
prestige of the Indians if they won. j
A victory over either Minnesota or !
Texas A. & M. would rank Stan
ford first or second in the nation. |
Of these two teams, Minnesota
would be considered by sports fans !
in general as the worthiest oppo- j
nent, Texas A. & M. is the most like- |
ly to accept the invitation.
Athletic heads of the Big 'Nine j
will meet December 6; on that date j
they might, conceivably, authorize I
post-season games for Western Con- 1
ference teams. Whether the Pacific
Coast representative would care to
withhold naming their opponent un
til after this meeting is problemat- j
ical.
Texas A. & M. remains the most
logical team (o get the bid. The
Cadets, however, have one more
tough hurdle to get over before
completing a two-year undefeated
record. They must heat the Texas
Longhoms in their last scheduled
game Thursday.
While the Cadets should have
enough stuff to t;ike the Longhoms,
they'll have to bust another estab
lished tradition to do it. For some
time down in the Southwest Con
ference these two teams have been
alternating victories. This fall it's
Texas' turn to come out on top. '
If highly-publicized Cowboy Jack
Crain busts loose a time or two,
(hey might do it, and further com
plicate the Bowl selection.
