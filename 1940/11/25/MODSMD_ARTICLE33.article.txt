# Booters Prep For Bear Tilt
## 
### 
Stanford's soccermen will get the i
jump on Big Game festivities when j
they engage the Golden Bear boot- |
ers from California on the home field
Wednesday afternoon.
The Card eleven will be fighting to
stay within striking distance of the
league leading San Jose Spartans. A
loss to the Bears would kill the
mathematical possibility of the Ma
loneymen copping the title.
The game will be the first of the
annual two-game series, the second
will be played at Berkeley Saturday
morning before the Big Game.
Wednesday's tussle will also be the
last appearance for the Cards on
their home field for the 1940 season.
The Stanford booters snapped out
of a two weeks slump last Wednes
day when they trounced San Fran
cisco Junior College, 4-1. This vic
tory establishes the Cards as slight
favorites over the Berkeley aggre
gation, as the Bears could get no
better than a tie game with the
same team.
Coach Tevfik Sadullah's frosh will
take on the Bear Cubs on the frosh
field at the same time the varsity
is playing Wednesday. The Pap
oose kickers have played only two
games so far this year, losing one
and tieing one, but have gained
experience by scrimmaging the
varsity reserves in practice.
