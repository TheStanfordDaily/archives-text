### 
ANN ARBOR, Mich., Nov. 24
(UP). —Into a musty trunk down in
a humid locker room tonight was
stuffed a scrap of maize and blue
bearing number 98, the jersey of
Tom Harmon, the second football
player the University of Michigan
has thus immortalized.
Henry Hatch, equipment manager,
laid the jersey away beside the
number 47, which once covered the
back of Benny Oosterbaan, all
time great end of the middle '20's.
These numbers, never again to be
worn at the Wolverine school, have
been blazed in football annals with
unmatched brilliance.
The last chapter for No. 98 was
written Saturday at Columbus, Ohio,
when Harmon finished his college
career by shattering the touchdown
record of Red Grange, the old "Gal
loping Ghost" of Illinois in the
last decade. Harmon scored three
touchdowns as Michigan routed
Ohio State 40-0, lo shoot his total
for three seasons to 33. Grange
scored 31 for Illinois.
