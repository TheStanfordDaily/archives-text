# Standlee Absent as Card Team Scrimmages Against Cal Plays
## 
### 
With Norm Standlee still hobbling around on crutches, the Indian grid
ders will go back to work Ibis afternoon, preparing for the Big Game.
After stiff workouts Friday and Saturday, the Indians had a day oil
yesterday, will start working against Cal plays either this afternoon or

tomorrow.
Fred Meyer and Clem Tomerlin,
who were with Standlee on the in
jured list, are expected to be % in
shape to go through practices with
the rest of the squad starting today.
Suffering from leg injuries, both
were kept out of suits until Satur-

The odds against Standlee's even
being in a suit Saturday are grow
ing larger as every hour passes. The
medicos haven't been able to dis
cover the cause of the swelling that
I sets in as soon as The Chief starts
to do any running.
Because of the injury, Norm is now
considerably out of condition. He
j tips the beam at about 225 compared
to his regular playing weight of 216
J pounds. Even if the ankle trouble
j does clear up, he would probably
not be in shape to play his best game
against the Bears.
Coach Clark Shaughnessy branded
! Saturday's practice as the "worst of
the year," but said that the squad
i should get back in stride this week.
He blamed the poor showing on the
1 three-day lay-off following the Ore
gon State game.
