# Who Cares About Finals?
## 
### 
FINAL examinations are three weeks away,
but to the majority of the Stanford campus
the quarter will build into its climax Thursday
and Friday of this week. And Saturday, with the
Big Game, it will end. Of course, there will still
be those exams, but if Stanford wins the Big
Game (for the first time since 1936), it is a safe
thing to say that they will be only an incidental
hurdle between the conclusion of the regular
season and the Rose Bowl game.
Every year, no matter how the football team
has fared, Big Game Week is one of gala festivi
ties on the Farm. The Bonfire, Rally, Parade,
Gaieties, and, now, Dance are all part of the
maze of activities which inundates Stanford
students. Spirit is usually high during this
week.
For the past three years, however, it has
been somewhat difficult for Stanford men and
women to do more than simulate true, irresis
tible Spirit. It's not easy to give the old rah-rah
try when you are on the losing side consistently.
But this year no one is worrying about the
campus attitude. A look at the football team's
record suffices as an explanation. Judging by
the unrest in Encina, 1940's Bonfire is going to
be the biggest in years. The frosh are anxious
to get at those boxes and logs that form the
gigantic pyre, and rumor has it that they are
disappointed that last year's ruling by the Ad
ministration prevents them from starting the
search before Thursday morning.
Inaugurated with singular success last year,
the Big Game Dance will be held at the San
Francisco Golf and Country Club this year with
Freddy Nagel's orchestra on the bandstand.
After several weeks of indecision, the dance
was held last year because of strong support
given the undertaking by The Daily.
Despite the scant time for preparations it was
an unqualified success. This year it should
firmly entrench itself as a traditional activity of
Big Game Week.
The Gaieties on Thursday and Friday will
be up to their usual standard, under the guid
ance of Harry Muheim. Muheim, one of Stan
ford's funniest comedians, has prepared a show
that he thinks will surpass even last year's
howl-fest.
Saturday—the Big Game, the last step on
Stanford's Rose Bowl path.
No, there doesn't seem to be much doubt that
final exams will be but an anti-climax to this
quarter's festivities.—G. M.

Every year, no matter how the football team
has fared, Big Game Week is one of gala festivi
ties on the Farm. The Bonfire, Rally, Parade,
Gaieties, and, now, Dance are all part of the
maze of activities which inundates Stanford
students. Spirit is usually high during this
week.
For the past three years, however, it has
been somewhat difficult for Stanford men and
women to do more than simulate true, irresis
tible Spirit. It's not easy to give the old rah-rah
try when you are on the losing side consistently.
But this year no one is worrying about the
campus attitude. A look at the football team's
record suffices as an explanation. Judging by
the unrest in Encina, 1940's Bonfire is going to
be the biggest in years. The frosh are anxious
to get at those boxes and logs that form the
gigantic pyre, and rumor has it that they are
disappointed that last year's ruling by the Ad
ministration prevents them from starting the
search before Thursday morning.
Inaugurated with singular success last year,
the Big Game Dance will be held at the San
Francisco Golf and Country Club this year with
Freddy Nagel's orchestra on the bandstand.
After several weeks of indecision, the dance
was held last year because of strong support
given the undertaking by The Daily.
Despite the scant time for preparations it was
an unqualified success. This year it should
firmly entrench itself as a traditional activity of
Big Game Week.
The Gaieties on Thursday and Friday will
be up to their usual standard, under the guid
ance of Harry Muheim. Muheim, one of Stan
ford's funniest comedians, has prepared a show
that he thinks will surpass even last year's
howl-fest.
Saturday—the Big Game, the last step on
Stanford's Rose Bowl path.
No, there doesn't seem to be much doubt that
final exams will be but an anti-climax to this
quarter's festivities.—G. M.
FINAL examinations are three weeks away,
but to the majority of the Stanford campus
the quarter will build into its climax Thursday
and Friday of this week. And Saturday, with the
Big Game, it will end. Of course, there will still
be those exams, but if Stanford wins the Big
Game (for the first time since 1936), it is a safe
thing to say that they will be only an incidental
hurdle between the conclusion of the regular
season and the Rose Bowl game.
