# Bellwether on Ballads
## 
### 
\\T SEE," said Bellwether with a faint smile,
1 that Thanksgiving vacation treated you
well."
I slid over to the corner of the booth in the
Cellar. "Sit down, Emery," I parried, turning
off the little light to conceal the bags under my
eyes. "And what did you do?"
Bellwether eased into the seat, cursing softly
as he bumped his knees on the table. "Well,
Laddie, I was around here all vacation. Played
around a bit, then studied in the libe all day
Saturday and Sunday."
Resisting an impulse to remind him that the
libe had been closed all day Saturday and
Sunday, I fended off an inadvertent blow from
the folded newspaper the Sage was idly pound
ing on the table. "What have you got there,
Emery? Catching up on back files of The
Daily?"
Bellwether's deprecating sniff was a master
piece. "Laddie, don't be humorous." He waved
the paper in the air to the imminent danger of
a loitering hasher. "This is a copy of one of the
City newspapers." He flipped the paper open
to a sports page column. "See this?"
"What?"
"This story here about our rooting section.
This guy doesn't like us to sing 'God Bless
Clark Shaughnessy'."
"Why, is he a Cal man?"
Bellwether scratched his head. "I never
thought of that. Anyway, he's afraid we're
using a tune that has become one of the coun
try's patriotic airs and parodying it."
"So what?"
"Oh, he doesn't like it. He seems to think its
detrimental to society."
I scratched my head. "That's twaddle, Bell
wether."
"Exactly. More than* that, he's afraid that we
might begin using the 'Star Spangled Banner'
for a football song."
Whew," I whistled. "He must be a Cal man."
Bellwether yawned. "He must have been
having an awful time finding material to finish
out his column. The great man yawned again.
I can't even get excited about it all." He got
up and patted me on the head. "See you later."
"So long, Bellwether."

The Sage turned away, then reached into a
gaping pocket and tossed back a scrap of
paper. "Here's a ballad I was planning to send
to that sports columnist. You read it."
I picked it up.
"Sports writer, 'tis of thee,
Protector of liberty,
I pen these words.
Next time you need some guff
To end your column's stuff
Just figure that you have enough
Without such blurbs."â€”W. C.
