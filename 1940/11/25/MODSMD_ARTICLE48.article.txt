MORE NOTES FROM THE CUFF
I BEGINNING today, beginning right now, another Big
Game Week is bursting into your sleepy con
sciousness.
i Throughout this week you will paddle against an
I avalanche of Big Game propaganda, which at first
j glance will appear to be just "so much more guff." So
here comes a plea for your more careful consideration
of the history, heritage, and hoopray which is coming
your way. It rhymes!
Obviously enough, these Big Game traditions will
mean a great deal more this year than in the last few
years. Nothing succeeds like succeeding. And really,
the tales of Big Game week read and tell like eight
| volumes of "The Rover Boys" under the direction of
! Cecille B. DeMille. You will hear how the axe tra
! dition began, of the running fight between Cal and
1 Stanford students all across San Francisco, and of the
; Cal student who grabbed the first woman he saw. pre-
I tending he was her husband so that he might sneak
the axe (under his coat) past inspecting Stanford men.
It's all good reading and listening, so give it a try.
i It will give you a new slant on this. Big Game Week.

speaking of stuff right out of "The Rover Boys,"
news has just come from Japan that a Stanford
graduate has had a run-in with the police.
j Even in Japan, it should happen!
In this case, it's Meville Jacoby. who graduated
from the Farm in 1938, and is now a United Press cor
respondent in the Far East. A whole pack of Japa
nese four-footers jabbed a whole pack of rifles in
\ Jacoby's back and then accused him of taking photo
-1 graphs of a Japanese military depot for one Charles
| Reed, United Slates consul at Hanoi.
"Oh, don't be silly, lady; everybody knows where
Hanoi is."
# * * *
Then the little yellow men went on to say that
| this was all a port of "self-admitted espionage upon
! Japanese military establishments in French Indo
| China."
Well, anyway, they released Jacoby.
Leave it to a Stanford man to turn up in an espio
nage case. This ought to create quite a boom in that
new Winter Quarter course, Espionage and Nasty
Business, 117.
* *, * sjs
let's switch back to the war situation in Eu
| rope. Well, to get down to it, yesterday a couple
j of women from Pasadena (women with these reports
j always come from Pasadena) who have just returned
j from France say that the French have discovered the
j way to demoralize the German army of occupation.
The French women won't talk to them. No. sir, not
j a single one. As a result many German soldiers have
i committed suicide.
That's enough to make you stand right up on top
of your theater seat and shout "God Bless America"
: right along with Kate Smith.

j of women from Pasadena (women with these reports
j always come from Pasadena) who have just returned

The French women won't talk to them. No. sir, not

MORE NOTES FROM THE CUFF
I BEGINNING today, beginning right now, another Big
Game Week is bursting into your sleepy con
sciousness.
i Throughout this week you will paddle against an
I avalanche of Big Game propaganda, which at first
j glance will appear to be just "so much more guff." So
here comes a plea for your more careful consideration
of the history, heritage, and hoopray which is coming
your way. It rhymes!
Obviously enough, these Big Game traditions will
mean a great deal more this year than in the last few
years. Nothing succeeds like succeeding. And really,
the tales of Big Game week read and tell like eight
| volumes of "The Rover Boys" under the direction of
! Cecille B. DeMille. You will hear how the axe tra
! dition began, of the running fight between Cal and
1 Stanford students all across San Francisco, and of the
; Cal student who grabbed the first woman he saw. pre-
I tending he was her husband so that he might sneak
the axe (under his coat) past inspecting Stanford men.
It's all good reading and listening, so give it a try.
i It will give you a new slant on this. Big Game Week.
* * * *
speaking of stuff right out of "The Rover Boys,"
news has just come from Japan that a Stanford
graduate has had a run-in with the police.
j Even in Japan, it should happen!
In this case, it's Meville Jacoby. who graduated
from the Farm in 1938, and is now a United Press cor
respondent in the Far East. A whole pack of Japa
nese four-footers jabbed a whole pack of rifles in
\ Jacoby's back and then accused him of taking photo
-1 graphs of a Japanese military depot for one Charles
| Reed, United Slates consul at Hanoi.
"Oh, don't be silly, lady; everybody knows where
Hanoi is."

Then the little yellow men went on to say that
