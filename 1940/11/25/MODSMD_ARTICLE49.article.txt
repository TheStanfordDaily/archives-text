## GORDY, YOU'RE WONDERFUL 
### 
r JpHE EDITOR, SIR:
A letter appeared in the Campus Opinion col
umn of The Daily concerning our faithful yell leader,
Gordy Nicoll. What I have seen of Gordy throughout
this year as yell-king has been "A number one" by
me. At every football game mid rally, Gordy has been
there to put them over. He has been the backbone of
the rooting section at all the games.
During the last game when Gordy said, "A six for
the Oregon State umpire!" he was probably just ex
pressing his own feelings jokingly, and letting us know
that he felt as bad about the decision as we did. As
for the other little remarks, I'm sure they were just
made to keep the rooting section in good humor, and
so that they would not go home thinking that they
had been to a dull game.
I'm sure that Gordy can back on us for all the
co-operation he wants and that this backing will be
in the true Stanford spirit. His good work so far out
weighs any little thing that happened last Saturday.
