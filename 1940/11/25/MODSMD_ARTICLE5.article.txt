ADDED TO THE ALREADY tense Far Eastern situation were the demands last week of Thailand (Siam)
for part of Cambodia, former Siamese territory in Indo-China. Premier General Luang Bipul Singgram
(left) outlined Thailand's claims while Bangkok "Thai BlÂ«K>d" workers staged an anti-Cambodian demonstra
tion (right). Border clashes were reported last week, but were denied in both Indo-Chnia and Thailand
capitals.
