# DEMOCRACY OR PEACE?

TP HE EDITOR, SIR:
In History... 1940, Bob I jOw states in part,
"Americans.. .are being pulled by the desire for peacc
and by the desire for the retention of our democratic
way, which they believe cannot stand in the face of a
totalitarian victory in Europe."
Ignoring the obvious lessons of 1917, ignoring the
less obvious but far more potent trends of today, Bob
Low states that peace or the maintenance of our demo
cratic way are the opposite sides of the coin.
Strong measures were taken in 1917 to railroad us
into the "war to end wars." Many people were im
prisoned for desiring peace (they were attempting to
overthrow the government). Workers were shot for
desiring a living wage (they were foreign agents).
And now, when we aren't even at war, we see the
same antidemocratic trends developing. People are
clubbed on the Capitol steps while praying for the
maintenance of that peace, minority parties are perse
cuted and thrown ofT the ballot, aliens are finger
printed and registered.
If this country, where 45.000,000 people haven't
enough to eat, goes to war we will lose all semblance
of democracy—and we won't regain it this time.
