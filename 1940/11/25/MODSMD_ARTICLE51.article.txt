Dick Stepp's breakdown of the $15 foes would
seem to put an end to the beefing about the money
paid to the B.A C. Apparently each student pays only
$1 tf) that organization.
But is that really all? Apologists for commercial
ized collegiate football commonly justify it by saying
that the income derived therefrom supports the other
sports and the gymnasium. Stanford, I imagine, has
a sufficiently large gate to do this. If so, then why
is the student taxed $i» every quarter for the gym?
Is this one really a hidden tax for the 8.A.C.? It would
seem that each one of us pays every quarter in
stead of only one. Th.it makes a difference. Eighteen
dollars a year should buy some pretty good (trans
ferable) football tickets.
