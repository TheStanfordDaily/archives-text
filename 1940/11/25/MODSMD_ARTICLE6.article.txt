# 'Forgotten Man? Forget It,' Retorts Daily's Simon Legree
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
There arc a lot of forgotten men roaming around the campus, but one
man who is forgotten, except by a select few, isn't worried about it. He is
Frank Bush, business manager of The Daily, and official Simon Legree to
approximately 100 people connected with the Peninsula's only morning

daily. ♦
Concensus around the Daily is that
Bush is a thoroughly nice guy per
sonally, but, as the man-who
cracks-the-financial-whip, he finds
himself the object of polite war
waged by the editorial staff—a no
toriously scatter-brained lot in re
gard to money matters.
However, a little impersonal hat
red is completely offset, according to
Bush, by the fact that the business
manager's combined salary and prof
its for the year will pay all ex
penses for his senior year.
As financial supervisor for The
Daily, he handles the income from
display and classified advertising,
and subscriptions, supervises solic
iting for ads, sees that bills are
made out and paid, and determines
what expenditures The Daily can
make.
DICTATOR—NO LESS
To the uninitiated this would
seem qiute a job in itself, but the
ramifications of the thing are even
move tremendous. The number of
ads in The Daily, alone, determine
whether the paper is going to have
four, six, or eight pages. The num
ber of pictures the paper uses de
pends entirely on the amount of ad
vertising, and, whether those pic
tures are local or syndicated is en
tirely up to Bush's estimate of ex
penses.
"One of the biggest problems we
have on the business side is getting
tryoutees," he commented. "The
frosh and sophs don't seem to un
derstand that there are seven sala
ried positions over here, and, for
anyone who plans to go into adver
tising, the experience Ls invaluable.
Our tryoutees are put through the
mill just as they would be in an
advertising firm or newspaper, from
all angles—soliciting, make-up, and
display."

The editorial side does its bit to
see that Bush earns his salary in
minor ways. If the Shack develops
a hole in the floor, he is hounded
! with pathetic yarns replete with
lurid details about fractured ankles
and injured dignity, until he calls
a carpenter: if the paper goes over
time he sadly digs into the profits
for time-and-a-half for the back
shop; if the heating equipment goes
wrong the staff wears mufflers and
sneezes reproachfully and pointedly
in his direction.
But the greatest of his little wor
ries is the typewriter situation.
'"What do they do to those things,"
I he asks, "pound out the copy with
I hammers?"

ads in The Daily, alone, determine
whether the paper is going to have
four, six, or eight pages. The num
ber of pictures the paper uses de
pends entirely on the amount of ad
vertising, and, whether those pic

tirely up to Bush's estimate of ex
penses.
"One of the biggest problems we
have on the business side is getting
tryoutees," he commented. "The
frosh and sophs don't seem to un
derstand that there are seven sala
ried positions over here, and, for
anyone who plans to go into adver
tising, the experience Ls invaluable.
Our tryoutees are put through the
mill just as they would be in an
advertising firm or newspaper, from
all angles—soliciting, make-up, and
display."

The editorial side does its bit to
see that Bush earns his salary in
minor ways. If the Shack develops
a hole in the floor, he is hounded
! with pathetic yarns replete with
lurid details about fractured ankles
and injured dignity, until he calls
a carpenter: if the paper goes over
time he sadly digs into the profits
for time-and-a-half for the back
shop; if the heating equipment goes
wrong the staff wears mufflers and
sneezes reproachfully and pointedly
in his direction.
But the greatest of his little wor
ries is the typewriter situation.

I he asks, "pound out the copy with

FRANK BUSH
There arc a lot of forgotten men roaming around the campus, but one
man who is forgotten, except by a select few, isn't worried about it. He is
Frank Bush, business manager of The Daily, and official Simon Legree to
approximately 100 people connected with the Peninsula's only morning

daily. ♦
Concensus around the Daily is that
Bush is a thoroughly nice guy per
sonally, but, as the man-who
cracks-the-financial-whip, he finds
himself the object of polite war
waged by the editorial staff—a no
toriously scatter-brained lot in re
gard to money matters.
However, a little impersonal hat
red is completely offset, according to
Bush, by the fact that the business
manager's combined salary and prof
its for the year will pay all ex
penses for his senior year.
As financial supervisor for The
Daily, he handles the income from
display and classified advertising,
and subscriptions, supervises solic
iting for ads, sees that bills are
made out and paid, and determines
what expenditures The Daily can
make.
DICTATOR—NO LESS
