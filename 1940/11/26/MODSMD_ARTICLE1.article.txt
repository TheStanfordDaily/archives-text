ORD LOTHIAN'S assertion that
J Britain can continue paying
cash for materials purchased in this
country for not longer than another
six months or a year did not come
as a surprise to Americans who have
been in contact with the British
Purchasing Commission.
Great Britain has spent vast sums
in the United States for some time
and this expenditure has been ac
celerated greatly since the outbreak
of the war. British purchases in this
country have been curtailed only by
the Johnson Act, which forbids the
extension of credit to nations al
ready in default on World War I
debts.
Several suggestions have been of
fered to permit Britain to increase
her purchases of war materials in
this country. The two that seem the
most feasible at the present time are
the following:
First, that the Johnson Act be re
pealed and that unlimited loans be
made to Great Britain; and,
Second, that the United States ac
cept British possessions in the
Western Hemisphere as payment for
further war material purchases.
* * *
[JOTH of these proposals have the
same objective—to assist Brit
ain in her war against Germany.
But they differ in several important
respects.
Repeal of the Johnson Act, for in
stance, would require Congressional
action, but a trade of materials for
new possessions in the Western
World might well be made secretly
by the Administration in Washing
ton. Several months ago, the attor
ney general's office declared that
the destroyer trade was constitu
tional. In return for the over-age
vessels, the United States received
not possession but lease of the bases
for 99 years.
America has annexed consider
able territory since the founding of
the Republic, but never has Con
gressional approval been asked
when territory was annexed. In
fact, it is possible that the United
States today would not stretch
from the Atlantic to the Pacific
had Congressional sanction been
required for each territorial an
nexation.
There is no precedent, then, that
requires a chief executive to consult
with Congress, and the majority of
Americans at the pi'esent time prob
ably would not voice strong objec
tions to another secret deal if Brit
ain were to benefit by its culmina
tion.
Objection to this proposal would
come quite probably only from those
who from the start have opposed aid
to Great Britain and who believe
the United States can contribute to
her owji defense best by remaining
aloof from the European conflict.
Every indication — including results
of national polls—is that this is a
very small group, possibly less than
5 per cent of the population.

the British Press Asso
k ciation suggested that a "possi
bility of the future" might be the
trading of certain West Indian pos
sessions to the United States for
war supplies.
Commenting on the possibility
of the repeal of the Johnson Act,
the association said, "... if the
isolationists oppose repeal, the
transfer of British islands remains
an ultimate possibility."
The objections to the repeal of the
Johnson Act seem obvious to many
Americans who point to Britain's
default of World War I debts. But
there are many Americans who feel
that aid to Britain at the present
time is an important aspect of 'our
own country's defense and that
loans to Britain must be made re
gardless of the risk. In other words,
they deem aid to Britain so vital
that they are more than willing to
give war materials to Britain.
If Administration forces urge the
Congress to repeal the Johnson Act,
the American people will have an
opportunity to discuss the issue; but
if the Administration decides to
trade materials for territory, there
will be no opportunity for discus
sion. This is one paramount differ

default of World War I debts. But

that aid to Britain at the present

they deem aid to Britain so vital
that they are more than willing to

Great Britain has spent vast sums
in the United States for some time
and this expenditure has been ac

country have been curtailed only by
the Johnson Act, which forbids the

her purchases of war materials in
this country. The two that seem the

World might well be made secretly

There is no precedent, then, that
