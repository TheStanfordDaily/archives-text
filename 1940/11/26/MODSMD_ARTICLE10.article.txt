## 
### 
Gaieties Director Harry Mulieim stood on the arms of one of Memorial
Hall's red plush scats waving his arms and yelling his head off.
"If you're not confused you should be, because you certainly look it"
It was the beginning of the first and most grueling of the Gaieties'
complete rehearsals—straight through from 4 o'clock to midnight yes-

terday. The entire cast, half a hun-

played through three times. Then—
"Okay, cast on the apron. Strike."
