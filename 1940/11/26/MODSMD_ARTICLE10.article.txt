# 'Cecil B.' Muheim Directs Mob At Grueling Gaieties Rehearsal
## 
### 
Gaieties Director Harry Mulieim stood on the arms of one of Memorial
Hall's red plush scats waving his arms and yelling his head off.
"If you're not confused you should be, because you certainly look it"
It was the beginning of the first and most grueling of the Gaieties'
complete rehearsals—straight through from 4 o'clock to midnight yes-

terday. The entire cast, half a hun-
dred of them, were battling their ,
way through the "opener." They i
tried it four times in all, and then j
Muheim made a speech.
THEY'RE OFF'
"All right. Be on tap when you '
should be. I'll see you from time 1
to time from now until midnight." I
The cast scattered, and the process j
of putitng 1940's Big Game Gaieties j
together, unit by unit, began.
First came "The union Must Be |
Preserved." Back in the darkened !
theater Muheim, slouched approxi- |
mately on the base of his skull, mut- !
tered suggestions to his secretary, !
Elaine Raley. The Cellar satire
played through three times. Then—
"Okay, cast on the apron. Strike."
OUT GOES THE CELLAR
The skits cast shuffled out to the
front of the stage and Pete Wan- ■
genheim's overalled stage crew set
about the business of moving out the i
Cellar counter and moving in Brad i
Young's particular section of the i
Foreign Legion. Mulieim, Secretary !
Raley's notes in hand, huddled with ;
the coast, pointing out mistakes, !
dead spots, making suggestions.
Only the beginning.
All over Memorial Ha 1,1 those not
required on s'agc settled down to j
kill time, one way or another. The
great round table in the conference ;
room was covered with books, rang
ing from "For Whom the Bell Tolls"
to "Social Control of Industry."
Out in the lobby, Dance Director
Adolfo Arias peacelully put his
corps of dancers through two rou
tines at the same time. In the
Green Room several bull sessions
grew heated. A select few slept in
the overstuffed orchestra seats.
Meanwhile th various musical
numbers and skits were taking shape
on the stage. People scuttled in
and out with microphones while
strange comments floated from the
loudspeaker—"Oh, dam', too low
in the middle" . . . "Testing, one,
two" ... "I donno about that?"
. . . "Boy, neither do I."
AND lIOUKS LATER
They ate at 7 o'clock, and then
back to the routine.—"Okay, cast
on apron. Strike."—At 10:30, Mu
heim, a little dazed, was murmur
ing.
"Geez, the show looks eood . .

. . . "Boy, neither do I."
