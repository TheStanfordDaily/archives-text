# Sororities Plan Rush Schedule

### 
Panhcllcnic Council has officially
accepted the winter rushing schedule
planned by Virginia Stcrry and pre
sented to the sorority organization
at its last meeting.
The schedule is different from last
year's in that it has four periods in
stead of the usual three which
should insure both Robleitcs and
sorority girls a wider basis on which
to make their decisions.
Rushing will start with dinner,
Thursday night, Jan. 9. The first
period will also include Friday
lunch and dinner, and Saturday
lunch. The second period will in
clude Sunday dinner and supper
and Monday lunch. Sunday rushing
is another innovation of this year's
system. The third period will con
sist. of Tuesday dinner, Wednesday
lunch and dinner. Rushing will
close with preference dinners
Thursday and Friday nights, Jan.
17 and 18. Pledging will take place
Saturday night.
Panhellenic Council wishes to re
mind Stanford women that there
should be no contact between fresh
men and Row Women during Big
