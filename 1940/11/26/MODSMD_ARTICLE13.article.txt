# Stanford Students Paint Big 'C'; Cal Slaps Back With Quad Decorations
## Pre-Big Game Raids Get Off To Vivid Start 
### 
Stanford visited Cal's campus
early yesterday morning. And Cal
paid the Farm a visit at approxi
mately the same time.
At the Berkeley campus, the Big
C was subjected to a coat of cardi
al-red paint and a 25-foot red "S"
was painted in the street before the
men's gymnasium.
And on the Farm a 6-foot, white
"C" made its appearance just be
low the steps on Memorial Arch
which lead to the chapei.
THREE CARS STOPPED
One Stanford student was arrested
and two carloads of Stanford men
were stopped early Monday morn
ing by Berkeley police. The arrested
student was given a ticket for going
through a stop sign and was obliged
to return to the local campus when
the officer learned the purpose of
his visit. The police also Inter
cepted two other Stanford car*
heading for the "C" and .sent tliem
back to the Farm.
The Stanford Daily learned yes
terday that, six cars left the Farm
about 2 o'clock in the morning after
waking a local hardware merchant
who sold them the paint. Tho En
cina-filled cars separated and ad
vanced upon Cal by different
routes.
810 C' SUFFERS
Three of the cars were accident
ally intercepted, one became lost en
route, and two arrived at the "C."
Cal's symbol was unguarded, but
covered with grease so that no paint
could be applied.
But the ingenious freshmen mixed
gasoline with their paint and went
ahead with the raid. Only half of
the "C" could be reddened, how
ever, as the rest of the paint was in
the car that became lost.
Occupants of the missing car were
not to be undone, for they painted a
big "S" on the street in front of the
men's gym in the heart of Cal's
campus.
OFFICER SKIDS ON PAINT
This was discovered by Officer
J. L. Ross at 3:30 o'clock, shortly
after he had arrested the first Stan
ford student. The patrol car he
was driving skidded on the paint
slippery pavement.
Little information has been ob
tained concerning the Cal raid on
the local campus. Several Encina
men reported that four Cal students
walked through the frosh hall short
ly after midnight but this has not.
been verified.
Local campus officers were un
aware of the paint job and had no
report of it previous to The Daily's
telephoned questions. San Fran
cisco papers reported the painting
of the "S" in front of the gym but
said the "C" was untouched. None
mentioned the raid on the Farm.
