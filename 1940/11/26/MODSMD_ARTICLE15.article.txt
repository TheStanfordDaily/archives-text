# Men's Council Cautions Against Campus Raids
## 
### 
Mens Council at its regular Monday meeting, yesterday issued warning
against infraction of the no invasion pledge signed last month for the
eighth successive year by the Student Body presidents of Stanford and
California, and hinted that "drastic measures" would be taken should such

infractions occur.
This attitude was taken without
previous knowledge of Sunday
night's raid on the California cam
pus, Wilson Camion, chairman of
Council, said.
"Council's decision was made with
absolutely no previous knowledge of
last night's affair," Cannon said yes
terday. "When the matter was con
sidered it was hoped that there
would he no occasion to discuss any
such infractions."
No comment was made on what
the "drastic measures" might be.
Since the first signing of the mu
tual agreement is 1933, there have
been no Council cases on the Stan
ford campus for a violation of the
pact.
Other business of yesterday's
meeting included a varied series of
traffic offenses. Stressed again dur
ing the session was the parking area
behind Education Building which is
reserved for the use of faculty
members.
Several traffic violators who have
not appeared at meeting on sched
ule were again warned of the in
creased fine which may be levied
against, latecomers. Those who arc
unable to attend Council meeting
were advised to contact some Coun
cil mcmlxjr beforehand.
