### 
Immediately following the Gaie
ties, all roads will lead to the Pa
vilion for the Big Game Jolly-up.
Chairman Jess Hazlett announced
that Jimmie Davis and his orches
tra will play for the dance. Admis
sion is free.
Hazlett said yesterday that he
hoped the campus queens would
help to make this one of the best
jolly-ups ever by showing up and
giving those fellows a break who
didn't get their bid for a date for
Big Game Night in under the three
week limit.
