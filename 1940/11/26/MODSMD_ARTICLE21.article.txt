WASHINGTON, Nov. (UP). —Great Britain hopes to obtain finan
cial aid from the United Stales next year as well as ships, planes and
munitions, liriiish Ambassador Lord Lothian said today after an 80-
minnte conference with President Roosevelt.
lie insisted that he and Mr. Roosevelt "never mentioned finance at all"

their conference and the
President "made no promises of any
sort or kind."
The ambassador went to the White
House two days atfer his return
from London, where he has been
conferring during the past month
with his government.
All) EXPECTED
Lord Lothian's expression of Brit
ish hopes for American assistance in
the form of finance, ships and planes
—a reiteration of statements he
made immediately after his return
from England—came in the midst of
a brewing Congressional battle over
any proposal to make U. S. loans or
credits available to Britain.
After leaving the White House, he
went to the State Department for a
conference with Secretary of State
Cordell Hull, who returned today
from a 10-day vacation.
Mr. Roosevelt met with Hull for
about a half hour after the Presi
dent conferred for 90 minutes with
Senate Majority Leader Alben W.
Barkley md other Congressional ad
visers
Barkley said he did not believe
the matter of British loans or cred
its would be brought up during the
remaining days of the present ses
sion.
NO COMMENT
He and the others declined to say
whether the question of loans was
discussed during the conversations
with Mr. Roosevelt.
Tip-off on the impending Con
gressional battle was furnished by
Sen. Gerald P. Nye, R., N.D., who
introduced a resolution calling for a
senatorial inquiry into the extent of
the British Empire's financial re
sources in this country.
The action was seen as a reply to
demands by Sen. William H. King,
D., Utah, for repeal of the Johnson
Act which bans credits and loans to
any nation in default of its World
War debts to the United States.
JOHNSON TO FIGHT
Sen. Hiram W. Johnson, R., Cal.,
author of the act, promised a last
ditch fight to keep the ban in oper
ation.
Government sources have said that
British credits in this country
amount to $8,000,000,000 or more in
cash, securities, real estate,
plant and other investments. These
credits, they said) are "more than
enough" to cover commitments on
British war orders which arc placed
at $2,422,000,000 by a National De
fense Commission spokesman.
