## 
### 
"ARISE MY LOVE." now playing at the Fox Stanford Theater.
One of the better pictures to come out of Hollywood at the tag end of
the 1940 open season on movie-goers is this Paramount comedy, co
starring Claudette Colbert and Kay Milland.
It's a story of a beautiful newspaper woman, contrary to all traditions

of the fourth estate, and a flying,
solider of fortune who become em
broiled in the European fireworks.
SHE SAVE HE
Augusta Nash (Colbert) rescues
Tom Martin (Milland) from a firing
squad in Spain by posing as his
wife in order to manufacture a
scoop.
With a good start, the story then
proceeds to collapse into a sort of
Cook's tour of Europe, the principles
romantically traipsing around the
continent. Augusta and Tom visit
Paris briefly, go A.W.O.L. for three
days in the Forest of Compeigne,
then start for America on the Athe
nia, bound for home and security.
THEN THEY PAKT
After the tragedy, which both sur
vive in true Hollywood style, they
split up, Milland going to fly for
Poland, Colbert going back to her
job as a war correspondent. After a
series of current event headlines
and Augusta Nash by-lines, the lov
ing couple is reunited in the Forest
of Compeigne. midst hearts and
flowers and waving banners.
But in spite of the vagaries of plot,
the picture is raised above medio
crity by good direction, capable act
ing by the leads and several sup
porting character's, and sharp dia
logue which, unfortunately, gives
place to the "moral" in the closing
scenes.
ORCHIDS TO LEISAN
Credit for the able direction goes
to Mitchell Leisen, who put out a
smooth picture and showed remark
able restraint in refraining from
pounding home the preparedness
theme in the usual sledgehammer
Hollywood manner.
An outstanding supporting per
formance is turned in by Walter
Able as the harried Paris editor of
the Associated News, Colbert's em
ployers. His oft-repeated "I'm not
happy" brought forth laughs
throughout the show. —Brucker
