### 
BELGRADE, Jugoslavia, Nov. 25
(UP). â€”Greek forces after a smash
ing 40-mile drive into the northern
scctor of Albania tonight were be
lieved preparing to dig in around
Pogradec and concentrate on Italian
positions in the central and south
ern sectors, according to frontier re
ports reaching here.
The main Greek northern army is
expected to occupy the strategic vil
lage of Pogradec, 48 miles south
east of the Albanian capital of Ti
rana, sometime tomorrow since the
Italian ocupation troops withdrew
from there last night.
ITALIANS FLEE
After the occupation of Koritza,
the Greek advance guard pursuing
the retreating Italians reportedly
has been unable yet to contact the
Fascist legions.
According to frontier reports the
Italians were said to be with
drawing to heavily fortified posi
tions in the Kamia Mountains about
six miles east and north of Pogra
dec.
Thus it is believed after the Greek
occupation of Pogradec the north
ern sector may be stabilized, with
the Greeks concentrating their ef
forts south of the Koritza region in
the central sector.
GREEKS ADVANCE
Greek forces in the Pogradec sec
tor were said to be advancing con
tinuously and have occupied with
out fighting the villages of Nisavec,
Podgorje, Bratomir, Halarup, Pis
kupije and Tuesmiste. By the cap
ture of these villages the Greeks now
have a line running from Nisavec on
the north shore of Lake Malik
northward to Tusemiste on the Ju
goslav frontier.
It was reported that the 1,500
Italian soldiers captured by the
Greeks in the Koritza sector (which
a Greek war communique an
nounced) constituted an Italian reg
iment which was without food and
arnunition.
