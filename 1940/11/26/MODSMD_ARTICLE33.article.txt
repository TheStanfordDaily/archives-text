NEW ORLEANS. Nov. 25 (UP).â€”
The executive council of the Ameri
can Federation of Labor won its
fight at a stormy convention session
tonight to retain unrestricted au
thority to suspend AFL unions that
engage in dual movements similar
to the rival Congress of Industrial
Organizations.

A mail pouch, falling from a train
n Ohio, scattered $75,000 in checks.
