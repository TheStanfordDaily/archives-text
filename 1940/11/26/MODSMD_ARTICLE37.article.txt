### JERRY MAYER JERRY BRUCKER 
(Editor's Note — Today Jerry I
Mayer, fonder sports editor of
The Daily and present associate
editor, comes back to the old Un-
I derwocd to get some words of
1 wisdom off his chest. Next week
East Lynnc.)

r pHIS is written in defense of a
! man who, it seems to me, needs
1 a few words spoken in his favor at
! this time. He is '"Tiny" Thornhill.
| whose contract was not renewed for I
this football season after his 1939 i
eleven had stumbled through the :
i worst record any Stanford team in ;
1 history has ever tried to hide.
To make my position clear, let
it be stated that this is not meant
to be a comparison of the coach- ,
ing abilities of Thornhill and Clark
Shaughnessy. Over a period of
years, Shaughnessy has estab
lished himself as one of the game's j
master-minds. This year's Stanford
team is merely concrete proof of
what grid experts have known for
years about "Coach Clark's" abil
ity.
But at the same time there has
I been a tendency to run Thornhill
1 into the ground unfairly. Perhaps
this is natural in view of the fact
; that the 1939 team's record was so
\ poor and this year's is so good. But ;
when Time magazine, with extreme
! sophistry, says the following, some
! clarification is needed:
"Taking over a feeble Stanford
j team that had won only one of its
games under Tiny Thornhill last
i year, shabby, shy Coach Shaugh
nessy had miraculously . .
Practically every sports writer on
j the Coast has made similar state
! ments. The general concensus on the
j campus seems to be the same—that
; Shaughnessy has taken the same
i material Tiny had, and made them
; one of the greatest outfits in the
nation.
* * *
That this is fallacious may be de
termined by a single look at the
: first and second string line-ups.
; Move your eye along the regular
| line-up from tackle to tackle —
Stamm, Taylor, Lindskog, Palmer,
: and Banducci. Every one of them
i sophomores, every one of them out
standing players. It is true that the
same first-string backfield returns,
but it is difficult to imagine how
effective they might be if the sopho
mores weren't in front of them.
The second string affords even
a more graphic example of the
fact that Shaughnessy has inher
ited practically a new team in
stead of a "feeble team that won
: only one of its games."
There's Tomerlin, Francis, Mc-
Cain, and Dhlevsen 011 the line,
none of whom have had previous
varsity experience. The second- |
j string backfield has three players
who arc sophomores—Cole, Vuci-
I nich. and Armstrong. The fourth
member of the second backfield,
Peterson, was practically useless
to Thornhill because of injuries.
The players who are new, and not
| holdovers from last year's "feeble
team," are easy to count. There are
12 of them, out of a possible 22 first
and second-stringers. Many of them
; are key men in Stanford's success.
* » *
That Stanford is fortunate to have !
acquired Clark Shaughnessy is un
deniable. His offense is the most

well-conceived collegiate attack in
the country. His discipline on the
players has been to their individual
benefits as well as beneficial to the
team as a whole.
But Shaughnessy can stand on
his own reputation. His pedestal
need not be built on the wreckage
of his predecessor. Because the
facts show that his predecessor
left very little wreckage. Shaugh
nessy inherited windfall material.
Ilis claim to fame lies 011 the fact,
then, that he used it so advan
tageously.
Thornhill's reputation should not
suffer because he didn't use the same
material to such good advantage. He
didn't have the same material.

well-conceived collegiate attack in
the country. His discipline on the
players has been to their individual
benefits as well as beneficial to the
team as a whole.
But Shaughnessy can stand on
his own reputation. His pedestal
need not be built on the wreckage
of his predecessor. Because the
facts show that his predecessor
left very little wreckage. Shaugh
nessy inherited windfall material.

Thornhill's reputation should not
suffer because he didn't use the same
material to such good advantage. He
didn't have the same material.
(Editor's Note — Today Jerry I
Mayer, fonder sports editor of
The Daily and present associate
editor, comes back to the old Un-
I derwocd to get some words of
1 wisdom off his chest. Next week
East Lynnc.)

r pHIS is written in defense of a
! man who, it seems to me, needs
1 a few words spoken in his favor at
! this time. He is '"Tiny" Thornhill.
| whose contract was not renewed for I
this football season after his 1939 i
eleven had stumbled through the :
i worst record any Stanford team in ;
1 history has ever tried to hide.
To make my position clear, let
it be stated that this is not meant
to be a comparison of the coach- ,
ing abilities of Thornhill and Clark
Shaughnessy. Over a period of
years, Shaughnessy has estab
lished himself as one of the game's j
master-minds. This year's Stanford
team is merely concrete proof of
what grid experts have known for
years about "Coach Clark's" abil
ity.
But at the same time there has
I been a tendency to run Thornhill
1 into the ground unfairly. Perhaps
this is natural in view of the fact
; that the 1939 team's record was so
\ poor and this year's is so good. But ;
when Time magazine, with extreme
! sophistry, says the following, some
! clarification is needed:
"Taking over a feeble Stanford
j team that had won only one of its
