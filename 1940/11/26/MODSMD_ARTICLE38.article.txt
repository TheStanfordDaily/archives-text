# Farm Aviators Defeat U.S.C.
## 
### 
The Stanford Flying Team won
their annual meet with U.S.C. for
the fourth consecutive year by the
narrow score of 27 to 23 last Satur
day.
Taking all firsts with the exception
of the balloon bursting event, the
Stanford birdmen were easily the
most spectacular team on the field.
S.C., however, succeeded in roll
ing up points by copping second
and third spots, and the meet re
mained in question until the last
event.
Dick Williams and Charlie Wheel
er of the Stanford Club had a field
day. Williams, who was flight cap
tain, took first in the bomb dropping
and Wheeler took firsts in spot
landings, bulls-eye landings and pa-
strafing, thereby taking top
scoring honors. Williams and
Wheeler combined their talents and
together captured the cross-country
event, cinching the meet for Stan
ford.
The meet was run off on a four
man team basis, the Stanford team
consisting of Dick Williams, Ed Rust,
Charlie Wheeler, and Frank Martin.
