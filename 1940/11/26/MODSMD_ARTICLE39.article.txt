# Soccermen Prep For Cal Contest
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity soccermen have
two big reasons for whipping Cali
fornia tomorrow afternoon. First
of all because they are California
and are due for a thrashing. Sec
ondly, because a victory over the
Bears would leave the Indians in
the race for the California Intercol
legiate Soccer Conference crown.
The Indians have suffered but one
defeat this season, bowing to the |
strong Spartans from San Jose State. |
The Spartans have since then been j
tied by San Francisco J. C. and a
loss by San Jose, coupled with Stan
ford wins over the Bears will give
the Cards the title.
So all Stanford has to do is to
beat the Bears. The Indians jumped i
out of a two-week slump last week i
by trouncing San Francisco J. C.
4-1, and Coach Harry Maloney be- 1
lieves that they can winâ€”if they ,
play the ball they know. At any
rate, the game looks to be a dead
toss-up.
