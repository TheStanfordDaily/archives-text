# Shaughnessy Grooms Vucinich, Parker to Replace Standlee
## 
### 
Resigned (« the fact that Stanford will he without the* services of its
ace fullback. Norm Standlee, against California. Coach Clark Shaugh
nessy and his coaching stall calmly went ahead with their preparation
for the rapidly approaching Big Game.
Even if the "Chief" is able to don a uniform next Saturday he is sure
to he a far cry from his old hammering, slashing self, for his ankle and

knee are still weak and he is about
10 pounds overweight after his
weeks of repose in the hospital.
The Indians' routine for practice
this week will be no different from
their success-producing sessions of
the past two months. Yesterday
they .smoothed over their offense and
got a smattering of the decepive de
fensive formations they plan to throw
at the Bears and their unorthodox '
"rocker" shift.
SUBS FOR STANDLEE
Without Standlee in there at full- |
back, Shaughnessy is running the ,
blossoming Milt Vucinich and has
flashy Rod Parker to back up the
"Slashing Slav." Though both of
these boys are fair country ball
players on offense, they are both
noticeably weak on defense.
"Voose" hasn't quite the speed
that Standlee had to cope with short
passes into the flat in his defensive
zone; and Parker, faster than Milt,
is not suie of himself, sometimes
coming in to make the tackle when
he should be defending against
passes.
POLISH UP DEFENSE
Shaughnessy's problem, there
fore, is to educate these two on
their defense assignments and to
polish up the type of Card attack
that functioned so well in the Wash
ington and Oregon State games
without the terrific power threat of
Standlee down the middle.
This means that Vucinirh and
Hugh Gallarneau will alternate the
punches at the center of the line.
Though they haven't the crunching
power that Standlee possesses, they
know how to pick their holes, and at
times a two-year-old could make
yardage through the holes that fiery
sophomore line opens up.
ALBERT CALLS 'EM
Against the Beavers and the Hus
kies, Frankie Albert mixed sweeps
around the ends, using his two
speedy halfbacks, Pete Kmetovic and
Gallarneau, carrying in either di
rection, with off tackle slants and
bullet passes.
Though the center of the Cal line
is not particularly strong, Frankie
will not have Standlee to throw at
it and may be forced to call the
type of game he did so successfully
in the last two tilts.

without the terrific power threat of
Standlee down the middle.
This means that Vucinirh and
Hugh Gallarneau will alternate the
punches at the center of the line.
Though they haven't the crunching
power that Standlee possesses, they
know how to pick their holes, and at
times a two-year-old could make
yardage through the holes that fiery
sophomore line opens up.
ALBERT CALLS 'EM
Against the Beavers and the Hus
kies, Frankie Albert mixed sweeps
around the ends, using his two
speedy halfbacks, Pete Kmetovic and
Gallarneau, carrying in either di
rection, with off tackle slants and
bullet passes.
Though the center of the Cal line
is not particularly strong, Frankie
will not have Standlee to throw at
it and may be forced to call the
type of game he did so successfully
in the last two tilts.
Resigned (« the fact that Stanford will he without the* services of its
ace fullback. Norm Standlee, against California. Coach Clark Shaugh
nessy and his coaching stall calmly went ahead with their preparation
for the rapidly approaching Big Game.
Even if the "Chief" is able to don a uniform next Saturday he is sure
to he a far cry from his old hammering, slashing self, for his ankle and

knee are still weak and he is about
10 pounds overweight after his
weeks of repose in the hospital.
The Indians' routine for practice
this week will be no different from
their success-producing sessions of
the past two months. Yesterday
they .smoothed over their offense and
got a smattering of the decepive de
fensive formations they plan to throw
at the Bears and their unorthodox '
"rocker" shift.
SUBS FOR STANDLEE
Without Standlee in there at full- |
back, Shaughnessy is running the ,
blossoming Milt Vucinich and has
flashy Rod Parker to back up the
"Slashing Slav." Though both of
these boys are fair country ball
players on offense, they are both
noticeably weak on defense.
"Voose" hasn't quite the speed
that Standlee had to cope with short
passes into the flat in his defensive
zone; and Parker, faster than Milt,
is not suie of himself, sometimes
coming in to make the tackle when
he should be defending against
passes.
POLISH UP DEFENSE
Shaughnessy's problem, there
fore, is to educate these two on
their defense assignments and to
polish up the type of Card attack
that functioned so well in the Wash
