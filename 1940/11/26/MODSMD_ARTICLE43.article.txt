# Fireboys Blast Sequoia, 33-0
## 
### 
It*x getting to be an old story, but
the Firehouse won again yesterday.
This time they blasted Sequoia out
of the intramural football picture.
33-0. That victory moves the smoke
eaters into the finals tomorrow
against El Toro.
Yesterday's game was a rout from
start to finish. The only thing dif
ferent from any other Firehouse win
this season was that the Pfyl broth
ers didn't do all of the scoring.
Tennis star Tom Kruger, Jim Mc-
Cloud, and Frank Farrell made a
few points themselves. Besides scor
ing touchdowns, Farrell and Mc-
Cloud converted once each.
Monte Pfyl scored first on a 12-
yard run which climaxed an 82-
yard march; McCloud was next with
i a 25-yard run following a 65-yard
march. Monte Pfyl ran 55 yards for
: the third touchdown and tossed to
! brother Frank for the fourth. Kru-
I ger passed to Farrell for the grand
| finale.
The Firehouse boys should have
! no trouble defeating El Toro for the
; championship tomorrow. Toro bare
! ly gqt into the finals by a one-point
| win over the Kappa Sigs. Tomor
j row's battle should be terrific, how
i ever,- for it pits three of the best
mural pigskin toters against each
other, namely, the Pfyl brothers and
| Frank Van Acketv ■■■■»
The Firehouse squadron bombed
1 its way into the last round with a
j first-round bye, a second-round
26-0 win over Phi Delta Phi,'and
