NEW YORK, Nov. 25 (UP).-The
college football curtain descends this
week on a grand finale of torrid re
gional battles in which four confer
ence titles and several bowl invi
tations will be at stake.
Navy will bo favored heavily over
Army in their annual classic at
Philadelphia because the Cadets
have registered but one victory this
season. The game lacks general
significance, but it is virtually cer
tain to attract the year's biggest
crowd, more than 100,000, because
of its tradition and pageantry.
Canners held 17.086,917 cases of
