AN ill wind blew through the Farm yesterday
and dropped a surprise package in the laps
of Stanford's student body.
The ill wind was the much-publicized account
of a Card freshman raid Sunday night on the
Berkeley campus. The yarn has been spun on
the feature pages of the evening papers, it occu
pies a front-page spot in this issue of The Daily.
The raid itself is not the entire story.
Eight years ago the student body presidents
of Stanford and California, acting with full con
sent of the student bodies of both institutions
and in their behalf, signed an agreement. The
pact was one in v/hich the undergraduates of
the two universities mutually agreed to avoid
and condemn the mass "invasions" which had
grown to the proportions of vandalism and
physical injury.
The move, wisely made, was not designed to
strip Big Game week of the fun and tradition in
which it has long been steeped. Fine sports
manship is the basic tradition of the Big Game.
But fine sportsmanship and student vandalism
are hardly synonymous.
Each year since that pioneering agreement a
similar promise has been signed by the two
student body presidents. Stanford's Bruce Jes
sup and Cal's John McPherson signed the 1940
model early last month.
A group of Encinamen broke Stanford's
pledge Sunday night.
Several weeks ago Jessup spoke at an Encina
smoker. The subject of the discussion was the
agreement which he and McPherson had signed
a few days before.
The Daily carried several stories and featured
editorial comment on the agreement.
Cal's campus is the scholastic home for some
15,000-odd students. On the Farm the total en
rollment hovers close to 4,200. Yet the first
inove in disregard of the mutual pact came from
the Palo Alto campus.
Yesterday, although totally unaware of the
preceding evening's jaunt to Berkeley, Men's
Council issued a thinly veiled warning to pros
pective breakers of the pledge. The announce
ment of Sunday's raid was not received until
several hours following the meeting.
Plainly worded in the agreement is a clause
providing for "severe discipline" should viola
tion take place.
The frosh who trekked to Berkeley apparently
overlooked the agreement in general.
Whether Council can or will overlook that
clause in specific is questionable.
This ill wind blew nobody no good nohow.—

Cal's campus is the scholastic home for some
15,000-odd students. On the Farm the total en
rollment hovers close to 4,200. Yet the first
inove in disregard of the mutual pact came from
the Palo Alto campus.
Yesterday, although totally unaware of the
preceding evening's jaunt to Berkeley, Men's
Council issued a thinly veiled warning to pros
pective breakers of the pledge. The announce
ment of Sunday's raid was not received until
several hours following the meeting.
Plainly worded in the agreement is a clause
providing for "severe discipline" should viola
tion take place.
The frosh who trekked to Berkeley apparently
overlooked the agreement in general.
Whether Council can or will overlook that
clause in specific is questionable.
This ill wind blew nobody no good nohow.—

AN ill wind blew through the Farm yesterday
and dropped a surprise package in the laps
of Stanford's student body.
The ill wind was the much-publicized account
of a Card freshman raid Sunday night on the
Berkeley campus. The yarn has been spun on
the feature pages of the evening papers, it occu
pies a front-page spot in this issue of The Daily.
The raid itself is not the entire story.
Eight years ago the student body presidents
of Stanford and California, acting with full con
sent of the student bodies of both institutions
and in their behalf, signed an agreement. The
pact was one in v/hich the undergraduates of
the two universities mutually agreed to avoid
and condemn the mass "invasions" which had
grown to the proportions of vandalism and
physical injury.
The move, wisely made, was not designed to
strip Big Game week of the fun and tradition in
which it has long been steeped. Fine sports
manship is the basic tradition of the Big Game.
But fine sportsmanship and student vandalism
are hardly synonymous.
Each year since that pioneering agreement a
similar promise has been signed by the two
student body presidents. Stanford's Bruce Jes
sup and Cal's John McPherson signed the 1940
model early last month.
A group of Encinamen broke Stanford's
pledge Sunday night.
Several weeks ago Jessup spoke at an Encina
smoker. The subject of the discussion was the
agreement which he and McPherson had signed
a few days before.
The Daily carried several stories and featured
editorial comment on the agreement.
