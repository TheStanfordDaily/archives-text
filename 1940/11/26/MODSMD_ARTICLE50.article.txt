FIRST steps to alleviate a situation on the Farm
which has assumed some proportion during
recent years were taken last night when a com
mittee composed of students, faculty, and Ad
ministration members met to formulate plans for
a student co-operative housing program.
Stanford, generally known as a "rich man's
school," has actually needed such a project ever
since the 1929 crash. Figures reveal that at least
one-third of the men in the student body work
their way either partially or wholly through
school. The recent rise in tuition and living
costs in the halls has aggravated the situation
for many of these students.
Coming at this time, the co-operative housing
plan will ease the financial load for these Stan
fordites, besides giving the Farm an opportunity
to investigate a system that is spreading rapidly
throughout the country.
The theory behind the co-op is not only a re
duction in living costs. It is also an experiment
in democratic self-government. All the mem
bers pay the same reduced rent, and added to
this they share the household work, such as
weeding the lawn, cleaning the windows, hash
ing at dinner, and the myriad of other tasks
connected with such a scheme.
This pioneer move (for the Farm) is a highly
commendable step toward taking care of the
needs of a large segment of the Stanford male
population besides providing them with a dem
onstration of practical democracy in action.—
