# What's Cooking, Old Man?

### 
THE DAILY, never an organization to break
precedent, holds its weekly staff meeting
today at 1:15 o'clock. In the memory of the old
est inhabitant of the Shack there has never been
an instance when this small weekly convention
was not held.
Guest artist will be Editor Hutchinson, who
will do cartwheels on his crutches to demon

| strate his athletic prowess. "The Voice of the
! Valley" will describe prune-picking conditions
1 in central California for the edification of the
intelligentsia.
Edit Board will convene at 1 o'clock to grope
desperately for topics for the consumption of
the staff.
