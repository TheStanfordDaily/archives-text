# BULL SESSION
## 
### BUD AMES 
NOW IS THE TIME FOR ALL GOOD . . .
| JIERE it is over four days until Big Game kick-off
time and already Stanford and Cal have crossed
swords.
All that is necessary is the mention of Big Game
i week, and then before you can say "Stanford Squashes
I Cal," student representatives from both schools start
i visiting each other with large burglar bags and buckets
j of paint.
It happened last year, it happened two years ago,
I it happened 50 years ago.
It happened early yesterday morning—when five
| car loads of Stanford men roared through the night up
; to the Berkeley campus and painted the C. We talked
1 with one of the boys who did the painting, and he
j says that the whole tiling was carried out as smoothly
; as ice cream sliding over a tonsil operation.
♦ * * *
| r jpHE inspiration came about 10 o'clock Sunday night.
So the painters routed out a Palo Alto paint sales
j man, and explained to him the situation. The paint
j salesman thought that it would be a swell trick on
Cal, so he sold them $10 worth of his best red stuff.
Five cars left the campus. Three of those got lost
| en route and spent the night wandering around Ber
! keley. The other two cars made it to the C. found the
| cement insignia unguarded, and so painted away, using
I whisk brooms as brushes. All returned unshaved.
Not to make the picture lop-sided, it must be ad-
I mitted that on the same night, some California men
I raided a Farm fraternity, making off with a few
1 Stanford trophies.
* * * *
| these raids will probably bring down the ad
! * ministrative wrath of Stanford and Berkeley. And
J both schools will probably hold a hasty meeting and
: agree not to carry on any more of these raids. It has
| been done before.
But year after year, as regular as fish on Friday,
J each school raids and re raids the other campus. And
j raids will be made when you are older and weaker
! than a bottle of beer opened yesterday.
These raids are all a part of the spirit of Big Game
Week. They are a part of that, something which is
j pounded into every Stanford student's brain from the
j time he or she sets foot on the Farm. You can shake
| your finger, the administration can shake its finger,
: but you can't stop Big Game spirit and Big Game
j traditions any more than you can stop Norm Standlee
j running downhill.
That's just the way the Stanfordite works. He raids,
; he grabs Cal r-ooting caps, he shouts jibes, because
j something inside tells him to.
There is nothing malicious behind the actions of
| either Stanford or Cal during this week. Little mate
| rial damage is done. . . .
j But. say, maybe those Cal boys raided us last night
J and planted C's all over the Farm. Why those . . .
