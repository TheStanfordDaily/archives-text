# CAMPUS OPINION
## THE 						POINT TO LIFE 
### 
EDITOR, SIR:
This is in reply to your note below my letter
in yesterday's Daily signed G. M. First may I ask
that the fact that you can baldly state that "two
persons may not agree on what determines natural"
law or ask "Who is going to evaluate what consti
tutes the absolute basis of God's law?" is only typical
of the great modern university and is the most shock
ing condemnation of our educational curriculum that
can be written.
I am a very poor philosopher, but please let me try
to tell you briefly and humbly what you are over
looking.
There comes to each and every one of us, as
there has come to every human being through the
ages, a day when we finally realize that we are not.
sufficient unto ourselves—when we know beyond all
doubt that some higher force outside our own control
is acting upon our being, and, at that moment, we
cannot help but ask ourselves if not "whence we
came, at least "where wc are going." It is then at
death that we can no longer hide the realization that
there is finked to us through a definite relationship of
cause and effect an outside force which determines
our state of being or non-being and against which we
cannot prevail.
It is this relationship between the force that cre
ates us and ourselves that constitutes the fundament
of the natural law. It needs no interpretation and
admits of no "evaluation." If wc recognize this rela
tionship and desire to express the sentiments of grati
tude and appreciation which are inborn in us for this
greatest gift of existence then we fulfill the natural
law.
Another phase of the natural law perhaps more
to the point in question is that of the relationship
between human beings as individual personalities, yet
all bound together by virtue of the common Force that
created them. As individual created human beings
each of these has certain attributes, certain inherent
rights created in him (for instance, the right to fulfill
the relationship between himself and his Creator as
he sees fit) and these rights are more important than
the right of physical power or even the right of supe
rior intellect or of superior material productiveness.
The power of control of the inherent, fundamental
rights of a person belongs only to that individual or
his Creator and obviously not to other created beings
who have nothing to do with their origin or use. This
relationship is fixed in the act of Creation. In order
to recognize it wc were given intelligence and a
conscience.
Here is the conclusion. The natural law is there,
fixed! Wc cannot "interpret" it.
We need only to interpret and evaluate our acts and
those of other men in their relation to the natural law
in order to distinguish right from wrong.
This may be difficult at times, but it is as certainly
possible as the facts of these relationships are certain.
That is the point to life.

all bound together by virtue of the common Force that
created them. As individual created human beings
each of these has certain attributes, certain inherent
rights created in him (for instance, the right to fulfill
the relationship between himself and his Creator as
he sees fit) and these rights are more important than
the right of physical power or even the right of supe
rior intellect or of superior material productiveness.
The power of control of the inherent, fundamental
rights of a person belongs only to that individual or
his Creator and obviously not to other created beings
who have nothing to do with their origin or use. This
relationship is fixed in the act of Creation. In order
to recognize it wc were given intelligence and a
conscience.
Here is the conclusion. The natural law is there,
fixed! Wc cannot "interpret" it.
We need only to interpret and evaluate our acts and
those of other men in their relation to the natural law
in order to distinguish right from wrong.
This may be difficult at times, but it is as certainly
possible as the facts of these relationships are certain.
That is the point to life.

EDITOR, SIR:
This is in reply to your note below my letter
in yesterday's Daily signed G. M. First may I ask
that the fact that you can baldly state that "two
persons may not agree on what determines natural"
law or ask "Who is going to evaluate what consti
tutes the absolute basis of God's law?" is only typical
of the great modern university and is the most shock
ing condemnation of our educational curriculum that
can be written.
I am a very poor philosopher, but please let me try
to tell you briefly and humbly what you are over
looking.
There comes to each and every one of us, as
there has come to every human being through the
ages, a day when we finally realize that we are not.
sufficient unto ourselves—when we know beyond all
doubt that some higher force outside our own control
is acting upon our being, and, at that moment, we
cannot help but ask ourselves if not "whence we
came, at least "where wc are going." It is then at
death that we can no longer hide the realization that
there is finked to us through a definite relationship of
cause and effect an outside force which determines
our state of being or non-being and against which we
cannot prevail.
It is this relationship between the force that cre
ates us and ourselves that constitutes the fundament
of the natural law. It needs no interpretation and
admits of no "evaluation." If wc recognize this rela
tionship and desire to express the sentiments of grati
tude and appreciation which are inborn in us for this
greatest gift of existence then we fulfill the natural
law.
Another phase of the natural law perhaps more
to the point in question is that of the relationship
between human beings as individual personalities, yet
all bound together by virtue of the common Force that
created them. As individual created human beings
each of these has certain attributes, certain inherent
rights created in him (for instance, the right to fulfill
the relationship between himself and his Creator as
he sees fit) and these rights are more important than
the right of physical power or even the right of supe
