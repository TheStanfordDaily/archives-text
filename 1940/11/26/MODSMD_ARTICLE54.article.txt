r pHE EDITOR. SIR:
To hear young men debate hunger in Europe
when in America people are slowly going under, he
cause their health is undermined by inadequate food!
I am one of them. Industry, business does not want
50-year-olds, so we are on relief and live on $20 per
month, paying rent out of that amount. It sounds silly
to hear men debate foreign needs when an American
cannot oven get someone to read a good play, in order
that the writer may get on her feet again. Yes. we are
a humane people, and so empty-headed. In order to
cover our own shortcomings, we go abroad and got
sentimental, which is much easier than to cope with
our own ills. Puck certainly was right . . . so was
