# C.S. Forester To Tell How To Read News
## 
### 
World War II has created a whole
new set of problems for authors and
writers, according to C. S. Forester,
author of "Captain Horatio Horn
blower," who will speak for the
Tuesday Evening Series tonight at
7::Â»0 o'clock in the Auditorium of
the Memorial Hall.
"Authors of belligerent and non
belligerent countries alike find it
difficult to concentrate on their work
when such momentous events as we
have seen during the past year are
crashing about us," he said recently.
"Creative writing, especially fic
tion, presupposes, on the part of the
creator, a certain ability to blot out
from his consciousness everything
but the subject with which he is
dealing. No intelligent, person, cer
tainly no person with imagination
enough to be a writer, can help
brooding over what the world is now
experiencing," he commented.
ARRIVES IN AMERICA
Forester was turned down for ac
tive military service at the outbreak
of the war; so he brought his family
to America and has spent most of
his time in Hollywood, where he has
been aiding in making plans for the
filming of his book, "Captain Hora
tio Hornblower." His most recent
work is "To the Indies." This is his
sixth visit to this country and he has
lived here for comparatively long
periods of time.
In the course of research for his
novels, he was impressed by the dif
ference between the accounts of the
men who actually took part in the
struggle and the'claims made by
their respective governments and by
the historians who came after them.
He observed the same processes of
work when, as special correspondent
and otherwise, he was an eye-wit
ness of various major events in re
cent history.
TODAY'S HISTORY
In his lecture tonight on "A His
torical Novelist Living in History,"
Forester explains these discrepan
cies and puts forward suggestions as
to how to read a full interpretation
into official statements made during
! the current course of events. He
! thinks it is possible to peck behind
i the scenes and not have to wait un
| til the curtain is lifted many years
I later.
The lecture will give Forester's
I view of contemporary history as
I drawn from the vital news of the
j day. Tonight's program will con
clude the Tuesday Evening Series
for the quarter. The Scries will be
j resumed January 7.
