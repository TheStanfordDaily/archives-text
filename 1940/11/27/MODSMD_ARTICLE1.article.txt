|>RITISH shipbuilding facilities are
inadeqaute to keep up with
losses caused by German submarines
and surface-craft raiders.
This is the statement that came
yesterday from Ronald Cross, min
ister of shipping, in a nationwide
broadcast to the British people.
Americans have suspected for
some time that Britain's shipping 1
losses were greater than gener- 1
ally admitted by the British gov- j
eminent or by the British press, J
but yesterday this belief was con
firmed for the first time by an
authoritative spokesman.
During World War I, it was a
similar submairne blockade that all
but forced Great Britain into sub
mission. British shipping was
aided immeasurably by America's
entry into the war.
Now, while Britain is not count
ing on our active participation in
the war, she is expecting us to con
tribute ships to keep the British
Isles fed and supplied with war ma
terials. But, only a few days, ago,
Lord Lothian, British ambassador to
the United States, indicated that his
country would not be able to pay
cash for materials in this country for
longer than six months or a year.
In brief, Britain Is faced with a tre
mendous problem — perhaps one
whose solution is vital to the exist
ence of the British nation.
Britain must have ships, and the
United States is the only nation that
can supply them.
But when Britain runs out of cash,
how can she purchase ships in the
United States? The Johnson Act
forbids extension of credit to na
tions which have defaulted on
World War I debts, and Congres
sional repeal of the Act is doubtful
at this time. The suggestion that
Britain cede possessions in the West
Indies in return for war materials
or ships from the United States is
practical from the American point
of view, perhaps, but it certainly
would not be the best of policies for
a British government (administra
tion) to undertake.

r J I IIE populations of British pos
sessions the world over—regard
less of race or color — consider
themselves subjects of King George.
If one colony were traded suddenly
to another power, it would be a
stunning blow to the other peoples
of the empire as well as to British
prestige everywhere.
Great Britain is a great nation
because she has built up this em
pire and the people of the British
Isles are aware of this now, when
the empire more than ever before
is threatened with disintegration.
The trading of a part of the em
pire for ships or other war mate
rials can be undertaken, then, by a
British government only as a last
resort.
Under these circumstances, it
is ilkely that the British govern
ment will exert pressure in Wash
ington to secure the repeal of the
Johnson Act. Perhaps it is pres
sure of this sort that has already
led many to believe that the ad
ministration wishcsh the Act to be
repealed.

1 ENERAL Juan Andreu Almazan,
* defeated Mexican presidential
candidate, returned to his nation's
capital yesterday and announced
that he had relinquished all claims
to the presidency because the
United States had thrown its sup
port to his opponent, General Man
uel Camacho.
The return of Almazan to Mexico
and the announcement that he will
relinquish any claims to the presi
dency comes as good news both in
the United States and in the coun
tries of Latin America.
Mexican presidential elections
were turbulent affairs long before
the adoption of a new constitution
in 1917 and they have continued so
ever since. The election last July
was not an extraordinary one, but.
most observers admitted that it was
one of the most tranquil in recent
years.
Travel on U.S. 99 to Los Angeles
is unimpeded despite four-lane con
struction near Madera.
