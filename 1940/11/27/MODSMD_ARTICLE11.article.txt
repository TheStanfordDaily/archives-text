(Tin* following interview with
Captain Friedrich Wiedemann.
German Consul Cieneral in San
Francisco, is presented in line with
The Daily's policy of acquainting
its readers with prominent names
in the news. The first of the series
was an interview with Wendell L.
Willkie.)

By HAROLD M. SHAFER

On his desk lay two books, "The
Strategy of Terror" and "The March
of Democracy." On the wall to one
side hung a colored portrait of Der
Fuehrer.
Capt. Fritz Wiedemann," No. 1
Nazi in the Western Hemisphere,
leaned forward on his massive desk
and told me what, he thought of
Adolf Hitler.
He recalled days at the front dur
ing World War I. when he was cap
tain of Private Hitler's company.
The German officer once saved the
life of the man who today directs
the destinies of the European con
tinent.
A member of the Chancellor's
personal entourage and one of the
Fuehrer's most intimate and trusted
collaborators. Capt. Wiedemann is

the present German Consul General
in San Francisco.
And in the way of world politics
he told me exactly nothing in the
most pleasant and gentlemanly man
ner imaginable.
Capt. Wiedemann's title belittles
his true capabilities—he's a diplomat
of the suavest school. He sniffed un
savory questions a mile away, and in
such cases either steered ihe conver

►sat ion into more satisfactory chan
! ncls or good-naturedly refused to
i answer touchy point-blank queries.
The Nazi officer denied any knowl
edge of or connection with Ihc Ger
man-American Bund.
I He declined to stale his opinions
on future Nazi-U. S. trade relations
in the event England is defeated,
He declined discussion of German
relations in Latin America.
But this handsome, well-built
sportsman conducts his office in a
straightforward, joking manner that
inspires confidence.
Growing serious for a moment, he
analyzed the man Hitler, and the
reasons for his success.
"In 1919 Hitler was the type of
unknown, brave soldier that had
served at the front for four years,
j Until the end of the war he was a
| dispatch bearer in my regiment.
! Events during the revolutionary pc
| riod of 1918 and 1919 caused internal
evolution that brought Hitler to the
I start of his career, the way he has
I followed ever since.
"Following the War years, Ger
many was hard hit. by the events of
the War and of the Treaty of Ver
sailles and. as a consequence there
of, there existed a feeling that there
would be no chance to rise again.
"Hitler promised he would be able
to rise from disaster and has proved
he could do it. For this reason he is
admired in Germany, and to this I
attribute his success."


CAPTAIN FRITZ WIEDEMANN
He added that the main fact of
Hitler's strength is his personality.
Capt. Wiedemann's daughter,
Annemarie, attended Stanford last
year for one quarter, and is now in
Berlin. "I had a letter from her to
day." He beamed at mention of her
name.
The consul general assumed his
present post in March, 1939, and now
lives in Hillsborough, but is planning
to move to the city in December.
He stated that there have been no
direct trade relations between Ger
many and the United States since
the outbreak of the present war, and
that trade with South America is
not strong.
He said the crew of the Columbus,
German ship sunk off the east coast
last year, is still interned on San
Francisco's Angell Island, and re
fused to comment on any knowl
edge of the whereabouts of the
Graf Spee's crew, majority of
which is said to have threaded its
way back toward the homeland from
Uruguay and Argentina.
IS HITLER S ADJUTANT
A native of Bavaria, Capt. Wiede
mann studied for a time at the Uni
versity of Munich in 1919. He burst
into international politics in the
summer of '38 with a trip to London
as Hitler's personal go-between.
With Messrs. Julius Schaub and
Wilhelm Bruckner, he is one of the
Fuehrer's three personal adjutants
and has an office in the Chancellery
on the Wilhelmplatz in Berlin. He
accepted tnis post when Hitler be
came Chancellor in 1933.
In this position, he handled many
personal appeals, petitions and re
ports directed to his superior, and
accompanied Hitler on his many
trips throughout Germany. His ad
ministrative life was Centered in
Bex-lin and the Berchtesgaden. In
1937 he was sent to the United States
on a survey. He was later dis
patched to London to sound out the
attitude of the British government
on the Sudeten question.
LIKES ATHLETICS
In younger days, Capt. Wiede
mann was an excellent horseman
and fencer, and a devoted amateur
racing driver. Today he keeps in
shape by boxing. Capt. Wiede
mann's command of English is good,
but he frequently falls back on a
translator.
As the consul's office closed for
the afternoon, an ex-Army officer
cordially said "goodbye," placed the
traditional diplomatic Honiburg on
his greying black hair, and strode
to the elevator.

By HAROLD M. SHAFER

On his desk lay two books, "The
Strategy of Terror" and "The March
of Democracy." On the wall to one
side hung a colored portrait of Der
Fuehrer.
Capt. Fritz Wiedemann," No. 1
Nazi in the Western Hemisphere,
leaned forward on his massive desk
and told me what, he thought of
Adolf Hitler.
He recalled days at the front dur
ing World War I. when he was cap
tain of Private Hitler's company.
The German officer once saved the
life of the man who today directs
the destinies of the European con
tinent.
A member of the Chancellor's
personal entourage and one of the
Fuehrer's most intimate and trusted
collaborators. Capt. Wiedemann is

the present German Consul General
in San Francisco.
And in the way of world politics
he told me exactly nothing in the
most pleasant and gentlemanly man
ner imaginable.
Capt. Wiedemann's title belittles
his true capabilities—he's a diplomat
of the suavest school. He sniffed un
savory questions a mile away, and in
such cases either steered ihe conver

►sat ion into more satisfactory chan
! ncls or good-naturedly refused to
i answer touchy point-blank queries.
The Nazi officer denied any knowl
edge of or connection with Ihc Ger
man-American Bund.
I He declined to stale his opinions
on future Nazi-U. S. trade relations
in the event England is defeated,
He declined discussion of German
relations in Latin America.
But this handsome, well-built
sportsman conducts his office in a
straightforward, joking manner that
inspires confidence.
Growing serious for a moment, he
analyzed the man Hitler, and the
reasons for his success.
"In 1919 Hitler was the type of
unknown, brave soldier that had
served at the front for four years,
j Until the end of the war he was a
| dispatch bearer in my regiment.
! Events during the revolutionary pc
| riod of 1918 and 1919 caused internal
evolution that brought Hitler to the
I start of his career, the way he has
I followed ever since.
"Following the War years, Ger
many was hard hit. by the events of
the War and of the Treaty of Ver
sailles and. as a consequence there
of, there existed a feeling that there
would be no chance to rise again.
"Hitler promised he would be able
to rise from disaster and has proved
he could do it. For this reason he is
admired in Germany, and to this I
attribute his success."


CAPTAIN FRITZ WIEDEMANN
He added that the main fact of
Hitler's strength is his personality.
Capt. Wiedemann's daughter,
Annemarie, attended Stanford last
year for one quarter, and is now in
Berlin. "I had a letter from her to
day." He beamed at mention of her
name.
The consul general assumed his
present post in March, 1939, and now
lives in Hillsborough, but is planning
to move to the city in December.
He stated that there have been no
direct trade relations between Ger
many and the United States since
the outbreak of the present war, and
that trade with South America is
not strong.
He said the crew of the Columbus,
German ship sunk off the east coast
last year, is still interned on San
Francisco's Angell Island, and re
fused to comment on any knowl
edge of the whereabouts of the
Graf Spee's crew, majority of
which is said to have threaded its
way back toward the homeland from
Uruguay and Argentina.

into international politics in the
summer of '38 with a trip to London
as Hitler's personal go-between.
With Messrs. Julius Schaub and
Wilhelm Bruckner, he is one of the
Fuehrer's three personal adjutants
and has an office in the Chancellery
on the Wilhelmplatz in Berlin. He
accepted tnis post when Hitler be
came Chancellor in 1933.
In this position, he handled many
personal appeals, petitions and re
ports directed to his superior, and
accompanied Hitler on his many
trips throughout Germany. His ad
ministrative life was Centered in
Bex-lin and the Berchtesgaden. In
1937 he was sent to the United States

By HAROLD M. SHAFER

On his desk lay two books, "The
Strategy of Terror" and "The March
of Democracy." On the wall to one
side hung a colored portrait of Der
Fuehrer.
Capt. Fritz Wiedemann," No. 1
Nazi in the Western Hemisphere,
leaned forward on his massive desk
and told me what, he thought of
Adolf Hitler.
He recalled days at the front dur
ing World War I. when he was cap
tain of Private Hitler's company.
The German officer once saved the
life of the man who today directs
the destinies of the European con
tinent.
A member of the Chancellor's
personal entourage and one of the
Fuehrer's most intimate and trusted
collaborators. Capt. Wiedemann is

the present German Consul General
in San Francisco.
And in the way of world politics
he told me exactly nothing in the
most pleasant and gentlemanly man
ner imaginable.
Capt. Wiedemann's title belittles
his true capabilities—he's a diplomat
of the suavest school. He sniffed un
savory questions a mile away, and in
such cases either steered ihe conver

►sat ion into more satisfactory chan
! ncls or good-naturedly refused to
i answer touchy point-blank queries.
The Nazi officer denied any knowl
edge of or connection with Ihc Ger
man-American Bund.
I He declined to stale his opinions
on future Nazi-U. S. trade relations
in the event England is defeated,
He declined discussion of German
relations in Latin America.
But this handsome, well-built
sportsman conducts his office in a
straightforward, joking manner that
inspires confidence.
Growing serious for a moment, he
analyzed the man Hitler, and the
reasons for his success.
"In 1919 Hitler was the type of
unknown, brave soldier that had
served at the front for four years,
j Until the end of the war he was a
| dispatch bearer in my regiment.
! Events during the revolutionary pc
| riod of 1918 and 1919 caused internal
evolution that brought Hitler to the
I start of his career, the way he has
I followed ever since.
"Following the War years, Ger
many was hard hit. by the events of
the War and of the Treaty of Ver
sailles and. as a consequence there
of, there existed a feeling that there
would be no chance to rise again.
"Hitler promised he would be able
to rise from disaster and has proved
he could do it. For this reason he is
admired in Germany, and to this I
attribute his success."


CAPTAIN FRITZ WIEDEMANN
He added that the main fact of
Hitler's strength is his personality.
Capt. Wiedemann's daughter,
Annemarie, attended Stanford last
year for one quarter, and is now in
Berlin. "I had a letter from her to
day." He beamed at mention of her
name.
The consul general assumed his
present post in March, 1939, and now
lives in Hillsborough, but is planning
to move to the city in December.
He stated that there have been no
direct trade relations between Ger
many and the United States since
the outbreak of the present war, and
that trade with South America is
not strong.
He said the crew of the Columbus,
German ship sunk off the east coast
last year, is still interned on San
Francisco's Angell Island, and re
fused to comment on any knowl
edge of the whereabouts of the
Graf Spee's crew, majority of
which is said to have threaded its
way back toward the homeland from
Uruguay and Argentina.
