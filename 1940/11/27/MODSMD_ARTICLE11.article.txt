By HAROLD M. SHAFER

On his desk lay two books, "The
Strategy of Terror" and "The March
of Democracy." On the wall to one
side hung a colored portrait of Der
Fuehrer.
Capt. Fritz Wiedemann," No. 1
Nazi in the Western Hemisphere,
leaned forward on his massive desk
and told me what, he thought of
Adolf Hitler.
He recalled days at the front dur
ing World War I. when he was cap
tain of Private Hitler's company.
The German officer once saved the
life of the man who today directs
the destinies of the European con
tinent.
A member of the Chancellor's
personal entourage and one of the
Fuehrer's most intimate and trusted
collaborators. Capt. Wiedemann is

the present German Consul General
in San Francisco.
And in the way of world politics
he told me exactly nothing in the
most pleasant and gentlemanly man
ner imaginable.
Capt. Wiedemann's title belittles
his true capabilities—he's a diplomat
of the suavest school. He sniffed un
savory questions a mile away, and in
such cases either steered ihe conver

►sat ion into more satisfactory chan
! ncls or good-naturedly refused to
i answer touchy point-blank queries.
The Nazi officer denied any knowl
edge of or connection with Ihc Ger
man-American Bund.
I He declined to stale his opinions
on future Nazi-U. S. trade relations
in the event England is defeated,
He declined discussion of German
relations in Latin America.
But this handsome, well-built
sportsman conducts his office in a
straightforward, joking manner that
inspires confidence.
Growing serious for a moment, he
analyzed the man Hitler, and the
reasons for his success.
"In 1919 Hitler was the type of
unknown, brave soldier that had
served at the front for four years,
j Until the end of the war he was a
| dispatch bearer in my regiment.
! Events during the revolutionary pc
| riod of 1918 and 1919 caused internal
evolution that brought Hitler to the
I start of his career, the way he has
I followed ever since.
"Following the War years, Ger
many was hard hit. by the events of
the War and of the Treaty of Ver
sailles and. as a consequence there
of, there existed a feeling that there
would be no chance to rise again.
"Hitler promised he would be able
to rise from disaster and has proved
he could do it. For this reason he is
admired in Germany, and to this I
attribute his success."
