# Cal Burns 'C' On Farm Quad
## 
### 
While a siege party of Stanford
frosh applied a red paint and gaso
line wash to Cal's big "C" Sunday
night, Berkeleyites were leaving a
few calling cards on the Farm.
Visible effects of the California
raid found here yesterday were a
20-foot "C" burned in the Business
School lawn, another, smaller "C"
painted in white on the pavement in
front of the Memorial ' Arch and
large blotches of yellow paint on the
Roble walk, the latter indicating un
successful effort sat a more artistic
production.
Removal of the painted "C" was
effected by the early morning appli
cation of a blowtorch, while Roble
ites left for their 8 o'clocks all un
aware of the intended da'tnage.
Only remains in front of the frosh
women's dorm were a few yellow
streaks in the pavement.
Commenting on the offenses, Jes
sup said, "The raids were in direct
violation of an agreement signed by
John McPherson and myself. We
hoped the non-aggression pact
which was designed purely to pre
vent injury to the students and de
struction or damage to property
would receive the support of the
students."
When the Daily Californian re
ported the incident, its editor, Ed
; Tackle, suggested that if local po
lice forces wr-re not able to handle
any situation which might arise
Governor Culbcrt Olson should
"call out the national guard."
