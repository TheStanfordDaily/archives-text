### 
Where's the missing bid?
Yesterday morning when Hugh Gallameau and Thor Peterson, sub
bing for Frankie Albert who was in the hospital, passed a hundred tiny
footballs out a second-story window on the English Corner there were
free bids concealed in two of the balls.
But so far only one of these slips has heen turned in to receive a bid
at the A.S.S.U. oflice. And this was turned in by a pass-snagging member

cii . uiuvt. xi.iiu mw w«."> n
of the fairer sex, Dorothy
whom Coach Shaughnessy evidently
overlooked when lining up ends for
the football squad.
But there is still one more com
plimentary bid at the U.S.S.U. of
fice for the person holding the little
slip rubber-stamped and signed by
Student Manager Dick Stepp.
Started for the first time last year
as the result of a campaign con
ducted by The Daily, the dance went
over with tremendous success.
LARGER HALL
This year a larger hall, the San
Francisco Golf and Country Club
on Junipero Serra Boulevard at the
San Mateo-San Francisco county
line, and Fredy Nagel with his Stan
ford orchestra will make the affair
a definite success.
Sue Atkinson yesterday an
nounced the names of members of
the faculty who will be patrons and
patronesses at the dance. They are
Dr. and Mrs. Stanley L. Sharpe,
Mr. and Mrs. Wytz Gorter, Dr. and

and Mrs. George Knoles.
The main dancing room will be
made to simulate a football field
(except for the floor) with cardinal
wrapped goal posts over the end
doors and streamers and pompons
all over the place.
AXE TO BE SHOWN
The huge Stanford banner used on
the rim of the stadium will also form
an integral part of the decorations,
as will the famed traditional Stan
ford Axe. The Axe will be placed
in a prominent spot well out of
reach.
Chairman Bob Beckham indicated
that provision had been made for
lounge and dressing rooms for any
one attending the dance who wishes
to change his clothes. These rooms
will be open all evening and were
provided so that it would be un
necessary to return to the campus
before the dance.

o'clock.

Where's the missing bid?
Yesterday morning when Hugh Gallameau and Thor Peterson, sub
bing for Frankie Albert who was in the hospital, passed a hundred tiny
footballs out a second-story window on the English Corner there were
free bids concealed in two of the balls.
But so far only one of these slips has heen turned in to receive a bid
at the A.S.S.U. oflice. And this was turned in by a pass-snagging member

cii . uiuvt. xi.iiu mw w«."> n
of the fairer sex, Dorothy
whom Coach Shaughnessy evidently
overlooked when lining up ends for
the football squad.
But there is still one more com
plimentary bid at the U.S.S.U. of
fice for the person holding the little
slip rubber-stamped and signed by
Student Manager Dick Stepp.
Started for the first time last year
as the result of a campaign con
ducted by The Daily, the dance went
over with tremendous success.
LARGER HALL
This year a larger hall, the San
Francisco Golf and Country Club
on Junipero Serra Boulevard at the
San Mateo-San Francisco county
line, and Fredy Nagel with his Stan
ford orchestra will make the affair
a definite success.
Sue Atkinson yesterday an
nounced the names of members of

patronesses at the dance. They are
Dr. and Mrs. Stanley L. Sharpe,
Mr. and Mrs. Wytz Gorter, Dr. and

doors and streamers and pompons
all over the place.
AXE TO BE SHOWN
The huge Stanford banner used on
the rim of the stadium will also form
an integral part of the decorations,

ford Axe. The Axe will be placed
in a prominent spot well out of
reach.
Chairman Bob Beckham indicated
that provision had been made for
