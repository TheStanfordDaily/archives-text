# Vultee Workers Accept Terms; Strikers Elated
## Dies Charges Union Leaders May Have Communist Support 
### 
DOWNEY, Nov. 20 (UP).â€”Vultec
aircraft workers late today accepted
terms settling a 12-day strike at the
airplane plant and the company im
mediately announced work would
resume at 7 o'clock tomorrow
morning.
A roar of approval was voiced by
the hundreds of workers who jam
med into the Odd Fellows Hall at
Downey to ratify an agreement
reached earlier today on conditions
suggested by R. J. Thomas, interna
tional president of the automobile
workers.
Vultee President Richard W. Mil
lar promised plane production
would be resumed "as soon as is
humanly possible."
THOMAS GETS CREDIT
Dr. John B. Steelman, government
conciliator who today took charge of
repeatedly deadlocked negotiations,
gave credit for the settlement to
I{. J. Thomas, international president
of the CIO Uiiited Automobile
Workers, whose aircraft membership
was involved in the strike.
The Dies* Committee on Un-
American Activities yesterday
charged leaders in the Vultee strike
had Communistic afliliations. To
day President Roosevelt in Wash
ington called Secretary of War
Henry Stimson, Secretary of Navy
Frank Knox, Attorney General Rob
ert H. Jackson and Defense Com
missioner Sidney Hillman. They
were to confer in the national de
fense program.
WAGES INCREASED
Vultee had agreed to a basic wage
increase compromise of 62 1 u cents
an hour, paid vacation, sick leave
and increased pay for beginners.
But the company had insisted on a
two-year no-strike clause. This
was the final stumbling block in
mediation.
A contract with Vultee will be the
first obtained by the UAWA in
West Coast aircraft.
In accepting Vultee terms, the
union reportedly reserved the right
to renew wage negotiations for fur
ther increase next vear.
