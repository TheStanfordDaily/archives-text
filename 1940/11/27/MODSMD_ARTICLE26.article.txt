## C. S. Forester Draws On History, Recalls Napoleonic Period

audience's sincere attention until
the moment sudden illness forced j
him to retire from the rostrum, I
while he spun a tale of the Napo- j
loenio period and compared Little
Corporal techniques with modern
warfare.

World Wars I and 11.
SUCCESS OR DEATH
"When you're working for a dic
tator, the stake you put on the board
is your life. If you fail, you die.
The statesman who pits himself
against the tyrannical powers of Eu
rope today is risking death by tor
ture."
This, perhaps, was the most start
ling statement of the Englishman's
interesting talk, "A Historical Nov
elist Living in History."
He described how, as a special cor
respondent in Spain during the
Civil War, he observed and helped
originate the term "Fifth Column."
'FIFTH COLUMN' IDEA
In writing an obituary of Gen.
Mola, Forester recalled the gener
al's statement, "We have four col
umns approaching Madrid, and a
fifth ready to rise inside." The ex
pression was later popularized by
Ernest Hemingway in his story,
"Fifth Column," and has stuck.
Forester told his listeners how
falsification of German submarine
logs in World War I led to unre
stricted submarine warfare, sink
ing of U. S. ships, and entry of the
U. S. into the war.
Not a little British propaganda
found its way into the speech, in
the form of such phrases as "the
eternal British navy."
The novelist made an interesting
address, but displayed the disturb
ing English habit of stuffing his
handkerchief up his coat sleeve.—

"When you're working for a dic
tator, the stake you put on the board
is your life. If you fail, you die.
The statesman who pits himself
against the tyrannical powers of Eu
rope today is risking death by tor
ture."
This, perhaps, was the most start
ling statement of the Englishman's
interesting talk, "A Historical Nov
elist Living in History."
He described how, as a special cor
respondent in Spain during the
Civil War, he observed and helped
originate the term "Fifth Column."
'FIFTH COLUMN' IDEA
In writing an obituary of Gen.
Mola, Forester recalled the gener
al's statement, "We have four col
umns approaching Madrid, and a
fifth ready to rise inside." The ex
pression was later popularized by
Ernest Hemingway in his story,
"Fifth Column," and has stuck.
Forester told his listeners how
falsification of German submarine
logs in World War I led to unre
stricted submarine warfare, sink
ing of U. S. ships, and entry of the
U. S. into the war.
Not a little British propaganda
found its way into the speech, in
the form of such phrases as "the
eternal British navy."
The novelist made an interesting
address, but displayed the disturb
ing English habit of stuffing his
handkerchief up his coat sleeve.—
