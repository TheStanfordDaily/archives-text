# Italians Rush Troops to Halt Greek Advance
## Disorganized Fascists Flee Along 120-Mile Front Near Delvino 
### 
ATHENS, Nov. 2<» (UP).—A big
battle was reported developing to
night in the Argyrocastron - Sante
Qnaranti sector of southern Albania
where the Italians were lighting des
perately to keep from being cut ofV
from the coast as heavy reinforce- j
ments of crack Fascist troops were
rushed to the front.
Well-informed military quarters j
said Gen. Übaldo Soddu, director of •
the Italian campaign against Greece,!
appeared to have stemmed the 11a 1 - i
ian retreat at some points by bring- j
ing up heavy reinforcements.
It was reported Soddu had hurled j
Fascist troops into the front lines ]
from the coast to the Jugoslav fron- j
tier while the Italian battle policy !
of decimating units for deserting po
sitions appeared to have been halted. ;
GREEKS IN ALBANIA
The Greeks, however, were said
still to be driving into Albania with
their many-pronged drive. In an
effort to check this drive, Italian
planes throughout the day roared
up and down the 120-mile front,
blasting villages and bridges and
often bare mountain tops. It was
believed a mighty effort was being
made to check the Greek advance
by cutting communications.
The heaviest fighting was around
i the town of Delvino, on the road
; between Argyrocastro and Sante
Quaranti, which the Italians call
Porto Edda for II Duce's daughter.
; In this southern sector the Italians
| were making a desperate stand,
l'earful of being cut off from the
I coast.
At the north end of the front, vic
j torious Greek forces continued past
! Pogradec and Moscopole, hammering
j at the heels of the Italians, who ap
j parently were falling back on El
Basan. Hundreds of Italian pris
j oners were sent to the rear in their
| own captured trucks.
STORES CAPTURED
So large were the quantities of
Italian military equipment and
stores captured in the Koritza-
Pogradec-Moscopole region that
| Greek military authorities report
edly detailed 3,000 peasants to col
j lect it. Greek troops meanwhile
j pushed on through the valley west
| ward from Moscopole and other
| Greek units forged northward along
I the shore of Lake Ochrida.
In the central sector, a United
j Press staff correspondent with the
j Greek forces confirmed that the
! Italian mechanized fqrees had been
j "hurled far back into Albania."
