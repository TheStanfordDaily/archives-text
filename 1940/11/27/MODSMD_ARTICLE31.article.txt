# FIELD WORRIES O.S.C.
## 
### 
CORVALLIS. Ore., Nov. 26 (UP).
â€”Coach Lon Sliner of the Oregon
State College football team was
worried today about the heavy con
dition of the Corvallis gridiron. A
slow field will work a hardship on
the Beavers, who rely on razzle
dazzle and are outweighed by the
University of Oregon Webfeet they
meet here Saturday.
