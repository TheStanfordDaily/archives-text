### JERRY BRUCKER 
AT THEIR semi-daily press lunch
eon yesterday, the Incorporated
Association of One-Armed Stanford
Sport Writers, surrounded by news
papers, scout reports, and three
stock exchange tickers, spent 18
hours and 11 minutes selecting their
19IJS All-American. After consum
ing 999,999,999" i cups of chocolate
and 34 packs of Sensations, the All—
Farm board of stooges selected the
lollowing eleven players.
Ends—Paul Severin, North Car
olina. and (icnc Goodrcaull, Hus
ton College.
Tackles—Mike Enich. lowa, and
Bob Kcinhard. California.
(■liards —Hob Suffritlge, Tennes
see. and Marshall Robnett. Texas
A. &. M.
Center—Bob Nelson. Baylor.
Backs—Frankie Albert. Stanford.
Tom Harmon, Michigan, Francis
Reagan. Pennsylvania, and John
Kimbrough. Texas A. & M.
♦ * ♦
r INHERE was a good deal of argu
ment about the seven-line posi
tions. Paul Severin, co-captain of the
North Carolina Tar Heels, was a
unanimous choice, but Goodreault
had to be railroaded through sup
porters of Hill Marx of Washing
ton and Stanford's Freddy Meyer.
In addition to the two tackle se
lections, Nick Drahos of the Big
Red from Ithaca and Jim Stuart of
Oregon received consideration, but
were relegated to the second team.
Suff ridge was chosen at one
guard, but Marshall Robnett, main
stay of the great Texas Aggie line,
was chosen over Bob's Tennessee
teammate, Ed Molinski. Southern
California's Ben Sohn was consid
ered overrated by a majority of the
experts. Chuck Taylor was consid
ered favorably, but did not receive
the post because of his sophomore
status.
Bob Nelson, because of his in
spired. dependable play with a
not-too-good team, earned the
first pivot post. Rudy Mucha of
Washington. Chct Gladehuck of
Boston College, and Vic Lindskog
received mention.

| 'lIOOSING the All-Americhn i
4 backfield was a cinch. The four !
named were easily the outstanding;
backs in the nation, both in ability !
and headlines. A quartet with the
running talents of Reagan and Har
mon, the passing of Albert, and the j
power dashes of Kimbrough would
be as dangerous an offensive threat
as football of all time could offer.
The only conceivable weak point I
of this backfield would be in the
blocking department, where most of
the load would fall on Kimbrough.
Norm Standlec's injured leg,
which has already caused him to
miss almost two full games, drop
ped him out of consideration in the
fullback spot, where he was giv
ing Kimbrough an even battle.
The positions were almost evenly
divided sectionally. Three men were
chosen from the Southwest, two j
each from the South, the East, the j
Midwest, and the Pacific Coast. I
Robnett and Kimbrough made Texas
A. & M. the only school to land two
men on the team.

to the strictly kosher, the NEA

named on the third string, behind
