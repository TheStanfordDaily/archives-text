# Cards Improve; 'Chief' Sprints
## 
### 
For the first time yesterday Stan
ford's Rose Bowling Indians gave
evidence that (hey were practicing
for the one and only Big (iame and
that they were out to win a victory
dearer to must alumni and students
than a triumph in the Rose Bowl.
The Indians came to life with a
bang yesterday, showing more zip
and fire than in any previous prac
tice session this year. They went at
full tilt for three hours, running
through offensive and defensive sig
nal practice with lots of chatter.
Their rejuvenation was quite a
relief to Coach Clark Shaughnessy
and his coaching staff, for late last
week the Cards had been distress
ingly lethargic and sloppy in their
ball handling.
More good news for the coaches
yesterday was the appearance at
practice of Norm Standlee, the In
dians' doubtful starter for Saturday's
game. "Big Chief" was able 'to
apply the pressure in straightaway
jaunts up and down the sidelines
but didn't attempt to do any cutting
on his bad ankle.
Though his leg was a little sore
alter his first real workout in three
weeks, Norm looked like his pld self
on his sprints; and if there is no
swelling resulting from yesterday's
exercise, prospects of his seeing
action will be greatly improved.
Yesterday in their defensive drill
the Cards concentrated on stopping
the power thrusts of impersonated
Jim Jurkovich and Jack McQuary
at tackle, and got pointers from then
expert staff of coaches and scouts on
stopping the Breakaway threat of
Orv Hatcher before he gets started.
NEW YORK, Nov. 2(3 (UP).â€”One
of the year's most significant heavy
weight fights will be at Madison
Square Garden Friday night when
handsome Billy Conn meets Lee
Savold, the Des Moines dynamiter
for a 12-round brawl.
