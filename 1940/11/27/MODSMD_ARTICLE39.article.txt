backs.
STARTING LINE-UP
Senior Cordy Nicoll gets the call
at right half, with Wilson Clark at
center half. Maloney called Clark
one of the best center halves in the
league, and that he measured up to
the legion of good center halves that
have been developed at Stanford.
The other halfback is Sophomore
Ray Chapot. who is improving with
every game.
The outside right and inside l ight
positions go to Co-Captains George
LaNicca and George Dole, respec
tively. Both are great leaders, and
are inspirations to the team.
At center forward will be Francis
Morgan, who has played every posi
tion on the team, but now seems to
have found his right spot. At inside
left will be Sophomore Joe McHarg,
with Tony Guntherman holding
down the outside left position.

means that the breaks will decide
the game.

shoulder ailment, while Fullback
Arismendi had a damaged knee,
