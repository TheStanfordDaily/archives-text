series, the second of which will he
played in Berkeley, Saturday prior
to the Big Game.
The Indians to date have an im
pressive record, which shows five
wins and only one loss. The Bears
seem to have a tough team, also, al
though they have tasted defeat
twice. At any rate, the game ap
pears to be a dead toss-up, which
means that the breaks will decide
the game.
TWO RESERVES INJURED
No practice was held yesterday,
giving the boys a chance to rest up
for the game. In Monday's session it
was learned that two reserves,
George Koffer and Louis Arismendi,
would be unavailable for the game
today.
Koffer was bothered with an old
shoulder ailment, while Fullback
Arismendi had a damaged knee,
which hasn't been responding to
treatment.

start the same team that has been
seeing heavy duty throughout the
year. At goalie will be Jack Burns.

one of the steadiest goalies in the
league. At right back will be pow
erful Ned Pugh, who will be playing
his final home game of his career.
Pugh, teamed with left back Dick
Harmon, give the Indians two
steady, long-kicking defensive full
backs.
STARTING LINE-UP
Senior Cordy Nicoll gets the call
at right half, with Wilson Clark at
center half. Maloney called Clark
one of the best center halves in the
league, and that he measured up to
the legion of good center halves that
have been developed at Stanford.
The other halfback is Sophomore
Ray Chapot. who is improving with
every game.
The outside right and inside l ight
positions go to Co-Captains George
LaNicca and George Dole, respec
tively. Both are great leaders, and
are inspirations to the team.
At center forward will be Francis
Morgan, who has played every posi
tion on the team, but now seems to
have found his right spot. At inside
left will be Sophomore Joe McHarg,
with Tony Guntherman holding
down the outside left position.
Stanford University started pos
sessing nothing in its own right ex
cept its buildings and something like
90.000 acres of unproductive land.
