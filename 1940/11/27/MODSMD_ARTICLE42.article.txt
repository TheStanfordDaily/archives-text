# For Frustrated Men Only
## 
### 
PRECEDENT is a difficult thing to buck . . .
or even to think of bucking. Precedent keeps
men out of the White House (sometimes), stops
Stanfordites from smoking on the Quad (some
times), prohibits local students from talking in
the library (never).
But one precedent that has almost been shat
tered on the Farm seems to have practically
escaped the notice of the persons who are most
vitally affected by its passing. Perhaps it is
almost natural that Stanford's harassed senior
men might not notice its exit. They have spent
three years encumbered by its awfulness, its
eerie unnaturalness.
Their lives have been made a living hell by
its presence. It has driven them to drink (if they
were 21 or over, of course), it has made a night
mare of their week-ends.
The subject under discussion could be but
one thing—the despised, omnipotent Ratio. In
past years, when the Ratio of men to women on
the campus was around three and a half to one,
existence for Stanford men was unbearable.
Women held the whip-hand; they could dictate
where they wished to go. The balance of power
was piled overwhelmingly on the feminine side
of the fence.
Stanford's senior men have been battering
against the Ratio for three long, unproductive
years. The fact that the percentage has been
gradually dwindling has been known, but it was
not enough to make any real difference.
This year the Ratio is the lowest it has ever
been—something like two and a small fraction
to one. But of course the seniors couldn't pos
sibly be in a position to realize this. They have
wasted away physically by their strenuous ef
fort to best an unbeatable thing. Their poor
bodies are wracked and broken. Their spiritual
beings are disillusioned and crushed.
But, such a situation does not exist with the
underclassmen. They have matriculated in an
era of bread and honey. Their chance of re
ceiving a green signal on the date proposition
is greater than it has ever been in the past. It
would be ridiculous for them to take the word
of the embittered seniors on the subject.
All they have to do is to walk (don't run) to
the nearest phone, call the woman of their de
sire, or a reasonable facsimile thereof, and say
in a quiet, modulated voice:
"How's about a date for the Big Game Dance
at the San Francisco Golf and Country Club Sat
urday night?"
The old fatalistic hypothesis doesn't go any
more. A Stanford underclassman who hesitates
because he is certain that his gorgeous, fur-clad
creation already has a date is lost. According
to the new Ratio, she undoubtedly does not
have a date, is just sitting around on her couch
waiting for you (and only you) to call.
But do not become satiated with your success.
Speak quietly while in the presence of seniors.
Let them pass out of the Stanford picture in
peace and quiet, softly muttering under their
breath of a percentage game that has left them
physical and mental shells.—G. M.
