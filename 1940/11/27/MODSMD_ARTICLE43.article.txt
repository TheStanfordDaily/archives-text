I his type of modifying clause has been crop
ping up in Stanford talk ever since that after
noon in the stadium when the Indians outdis
tanced Oregon State. Everyone was reasonably
sure of the Bowl then, but, after all, it wasn't
polite to mention the party before the host had
mailed the invitations.
So, in all official or semiofficial matters cen
tering about Pasadena or New Year's Day or
roses, the Farm has been making rather definite
plans for appropriate commemoration, append
ing somewhat awkwardly the conditional "if
we go to the Rose Bowl."
Ex Committee was more forthright than other
official groups last night when it clearly dis
cussed extensive plans for a gigantic rally in
Los Angeles on Monday night, December 30.
With undergraduate and recent alumni talent,
the Stanford band in full force, and the yell
kings in unbelievable glory, the evening should
be one that Stanford men and women will re
member for a long time.
Practical considerations tied Excom's hands
in their efforts to stage a New Year's Eve dance
at some country club or hotel in the southland.
They acted wisely in elinquishing the idea,
even though the desirability of such a function
was unquestioned. Financially it was a serious

proposition, and the difficulties in securing a
suitable site and band were almost insurmount
able.
Sanely turning from this venture, Excom and
Rally Committee decided to concentrate on a
successful rally for Stanford men, old and new,
before the Rose Bowl game. Bill Kimball has
been arranging details for the program and it
is certain that a centrally located and adequate
place will be selected for the pre-victory cele
bration.
At any rate, Stanford has relaxed a little in
its consideration of prospects for New Year's
Day. Officialdom may remain silent, but Stan
ford students, at least, have little doubt of one
team that will be on the gridiron in Pasadena,
January 1, 1941.

ping up in Stanford talk ever since that after
noon in the stadium when the Indians outdis
tanced Oregon State. Everyone was reasonably
sure of the Bowl then, but, after all, it wasn't
polite to mention the party before the host had
mailed the invitations.
So, in all official or semiofficial matters cen
tering about Pasadena or New Year's Day or
roses, the Farm has been making rather definite
plans for appropriate commemoration, append
ing somewhat awkwardly the conditional "if
we go to the Rose Bowl."
Ex Committee was more forthright than other
official groups last night when it clearly dis
cussed extensive plans for a gigantic rally in
Los Angeles on Monday night, December 30.
With undergraduate and recent alumni talent,
the Stanford band in full force, and the yell
kings in unbelievable glory, the evening should
be one that Stanford men and women will re
member for a long time.
Practical considerations tied Excom's hands
in their efforts to stage a New Year's Eve dance
at some country club or hotel in the southland.
They acted wisely in elinquishing the idea,
even though the desirability of such a function
was unquestioned. Financially it was a serious

proposition, and the difficulties in securing a
suitable site and band were almost insurmount
able.
Sanely turning from this venture, Excom and
Rally Committee decided to concentrate on a
successful rally for Stanford men, old and new,
before the Rose Bowl game. Bill Kimball has
been arranging details for the program and it
is certain that a centrally located and adequate
place will be selected for the pre-victory cele
bration.
At any rate, Stanford has relaxed a little in
its consideration of prospects for New Year's
Day. Officialdom may remain silent, but Stan
ford students, at least, have little doubt of one
team that will be on the gridiron in Pasadena,
January 1, 1941.
