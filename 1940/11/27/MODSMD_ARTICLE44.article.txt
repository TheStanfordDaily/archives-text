LENI) A LITTLE EAR TO OUR PLEAS
|T DOESN'T pay to bite the hand that feeds you. But
justice must be done (not to coin another phrase).
Things just can't go on as they have been these last
couple of days without some attempt being made to
print the truth about this C-painting business.
Recent reports printed by the big-fisted bosses of
this paper placed a large squashing thumb on the
Farmers who painted Cal's cement C early Monday
morning. Yesterday the following quote appeared in
one of the Daily's editorials.
Cal s campus is the scholastic home for some
15,000-odd students. On the Farm, the total enrollment
hovers close to 4,200. Yet the first move in disregard of
the mutual pact came from the Palo Alto campus."
That's a lot of misinformed hooeyâ€” to bite the
hand that feeds. Cal men were on the Stanford cam
pus raiding a fraternity two hours before the C was
painted. Stanford did not move first. Cal came first,
and the less maliciously-inclined Stanfordites moved
more slowly.
So, the nasty-nasty shouldn't be thundered down
on the Farm lads.

A ND in the second place, the first story written in
yesterday's Daily said that the C was covered with
grease to prevent the application of paint. That too
is a lot of hooey. And the San Francisco newspapers
stated that California students sounded the alarm and
drove the Stanford boys away from the C before it
could be painted. Again, they're wrong. Nobody from
Cal ever attempted to drive away the C painters, and
the C was completely painted.
It appears, however, that some California students
attempted to save face by telling the local newspa
pers that Stanford had been unsuccessful in their
traditional raid. On the way home, one of the Stan
fordites called a San Francisco newspaper to give the
news, and that newspaper said, "Oh, we know about
that. We've already had about 40 calls saying that the
C wasn't painted."
Probably Cal calls.
And incidentally, take note that the Stanfordites
called the city newspapers. They couldn't have thought
they were doing much wrong, if they were willing to
so publicize their actions.
This is just one opinion, an opinion which feels that
those Stanfordites shouldn't be blamed with "start
ing the whole thing."

HERE is a plea to the administration not to go
k " too hard. No one person was responsible.
Proof of this fact is a slip of paper now in Encina.
That paper carries over 240 signatures of Encina dwell
ers and it says, "We, the undersigned, accept full re
sponsibility for any action done by the Encina boys
who went to paint the C."
So you see, cracking down and punishing indi
viduals wouldn't make the Encinaites feel any differ
ent. They all feel a joint responsibility which can not
be limited to a few individuals.
