# CAMPUS OPINION
## THE 						WORMS 
### 
HTHE EDITOR, SIR:
Book snatching can bo cxpccted of some col
leges and there are obvoius reasons why, but why at
Stanford?
I'm beefing (and I'm not the only one) because I'm
more or less enrolled in a Soc. course in which we
use a text, at least I did until someone lifted it from
a libe book rack. That book (3.50) with the blue un
derlines, and daisy-chain on page 98 was my pride
and joy—and essential, too, because sleeping through
8 o'clocks every morn doesn't produce many notes,
so I use the text—shameful I know.
The fault is probably my own in placing too much
trust in the Stanford student body, or in believing
wholesale all about the Stanford honor system, and
the other high values that stand for this university.
On the other hand, maybe you need the book
worse than I, but be a good guy and leave it in the
libe when you're thru, so I can collect the bounty.
Expectant Bookworm
