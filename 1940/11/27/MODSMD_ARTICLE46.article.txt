yHE EDITOR. SIR:
Perhaps Stanfordites aren't smug, self-satisfied,
stuffed shirts. But they are behaving about that little
trouble across the water exactly as outsiders predicted
they would.
Stanford, in its well-bred way, is ignoring the whole
thing. And why not? Isn't that living up to its pro
vincial reputation?
Outsiders have always called Stanford provincial.
Provincialism was all right a few years ago. But re
lated to the present it has ceased to be mere provin
cialism and has become pure apathy, which is all
wrong.
Yes, there is a rumor that people on the Farm are
apathetic—apathetic to issues which are at this mo
ment changing each one of their small, contented lives.
These issues are namely the draft and the possi
bility of the U. S. at war. True, they have been ac
cepted by Stanford, but they have also been shoved
aside with false nonchalance.
Stanfordites have taken the "why-worry-it's-fate"
attitude or the "let's-not-talk-about-it" pose. What's
the trouble? Are they scared to death or are they
really smug and unconcerned?
In either case they're damn fools to go on ignor
ing issues—issues which are fundamentally personal.
They're waiting on the tracks for the train, uncon
cernedly twiddling thumbs.
The Stanford student is rated as one of the most
intelligent in the country. But what kind of intelli
gence is apathy?
That inuch-used and overrated phrase, "war mon
gcring," may occur to some of you at this point. But,
I assure you, you are not being submitted to any such
mongering. Besides, do you know what war monger
ing is? Can you distinguish between good and bad
propaganda? There are those who doubt you can!
How soon are Stanfordites going to get wise? How
much longer are they going to recline in a com
fortable hack seat?

Yes, there is a rumor that people on the Farm are
apathetic—apathetic to issues which are at this mo
ment changing each one of their small, contented lives.
These issues are namely the draft and the possi
bility of the U. S. at war. True, they have been ac
cepted by Stanford, but they have also been shoved
aside with false nonchalance.
Stanfordites have taken the "why-worry-it's-fate"
attitude or the "let's-not-talk-about-it" pose. What's
the trouble? Are they scared to death or are they
really smug and unconcerned?
In either case they're damn fools to go on ignor
ing issues—issues which are fundamentally personal.
They're waiting on the tracks for the train, uncon
cernedly twiddling thumbs.
The Stanford student is rated as one of the most
intelligent in the country. But what kind of intelli
gence is apathy?
That inuch-used and overrated phrase, "war mon
gcring," may occur to some of you at this point. But,
I assure you, you are not being submitted to any such
mongering. Besides, do you know what war monger
ing is? Can you distinguish between good and bad
propaganda? There are those who doubt you can!
How soon are Stanfordites going to get wise? How
much longer are they going to recline in a com
fortable hack seat?
E. G. E.
