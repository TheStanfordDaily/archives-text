# Davis Scores Hit in Drama Of Far East
## 
### 
"THE LETTER," starring Bette
Davis, Herbert Marshall, and Jaines
Stephenson.
This picture comes as a bombshell
special from Hollywood and for
anybody looking for something to
take his mind off the exams coming
up it's certainly worth the trip to
the city, where it is playing an ex
tended i*un.
This is a typical Somerset
Maugham story with its locale in a
British colony in the Far East. Bette
Davis, after shooting her lover in a
jealous rage over his having taken
a Eurasian bride, cooks up a fabu
olus story which completely fools
her husband and the entire British
colony.
EURASIAN SUBTLETY
The alibi fools everyone until a
letter turns up which proves with
out a doubt that she has been hav
ing an illicit love affair. Her lawyer
succeeds in covering up the letter
after going through much mental
agony and some trying circum
stances.
Perhaps the best moment of the
show comes after the trial at which
the lawyer has perjured himself to
save his client. A party is in prog
ress, celebrating the acquittal. Bette
Daivs finds a dagger under her door
from the Eurasian—a subtle way of
suggesting that someone is anxious
for her to get out of the way.
TRAGIC FINALE
She kicks the dagger aside simply
because she is just too cowardly to
go through with it. During the party
she realizes how guilty she is, as
proven by her action in pleading not
guilty. She drifts out of the party
and to the gate of the plantation
where the Eurasian is waiting for
her with the daggei\ There is a last
glimpse of her crumpled body and
then the strains of the orchestra
playing inside the house.
Excellent direction keeps the
suspense at a tight pitch throughout
the show and brilliant performances
by Miss Davis, James Stephenson as
the lawyer, and Herbert Marshall,
who plays the husband, make this
about the best mystery yet.—Wuen

suggesting that someone is anxious
for her to get out of the way.
TRAGIC FINALE
She kicks the dagger aside simply
because she is just too cowardly to
go through with it. During the party
she realizes how guilty she is, as
proven by her action in pleading not
guilty. She drifts out of the party
and to the gate of the plantation
where the Eurasian is waiting for
her with the daggei\ There is a last
glimpse of her crumpled body and
then the strains of the orchestra
playing inside the house.
Excellent direction keeps the
suspense at a tight pitch throughout
the show and brilliant performances
by Miss Davis, James Stephenson as
the lawyer, and Herbert Marshall,
who plays the husband, make this
about the best mystery yet.—Wuen
