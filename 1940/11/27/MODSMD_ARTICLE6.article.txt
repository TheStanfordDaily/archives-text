Due to the apparent misunder
standing or deliberate violation
of the "no invasion" pledge that
was broken by certain Stanford
students Sunday night, we believe
that a reaffirmation of the A.S.S.U.
and Men's Council stand is in or
der at this time.
The promise was aimed at the
prevention of injury or serious
trouble to students and damage
or destruction of property on
either university campus. The
pledge was made by Stanford in
good faith. In the same spirit the
A.S.S.U. and Men's Council prom
ised to uphold it. Conditions in
regard to disciplinary action in no
way changed since the signing of
the agreement.
We sincerely hope that this will
servo to clear up any misunder
standing and that there will be no
further unseemly conduct on the
part of Stanford students to mar
this biggest of Big Games.
