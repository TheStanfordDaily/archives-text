# Muheim Promises 'Terrific' Skits to Set Gaieties Pace
## 
### 
With the promise that the entire
Gaieties will bo as good as the open- !
er and finale—two parts of the show
guaranteed to be "terrific"—Direc- i
tor Harry Muheim last night re- J
pleased a survey of this Friday's
Gaieties skits and specialty acts.
First on the program will be "The j
Union Must Be Preserved," an actual
excerpt from a quiet Monday after
noon in the Cellar with hashers
hashing and the juke box juking,
as ever.
An authentic reproduction of Cell
Block C in San Quentin will be the
scene of "Escape into Paradise Lost."
Tliis is the pathetic tale of a few
Stanford men, temporarily lodged in
the California Big House, who sud
denly develop a strong urge to see
the Big Game.
O. B. NOXIOUS RETURNS
"Escape" will feature O. B. Nox
ious, as portrayed by Ash Wilson,
a character who is now wending his
odorous way through his fourth
consecutive Ram's Head production.
The skit winds up with a "fine, full
throated rendition" of the prison
hymn.
The same element, of authenticity
which marks "The Union" is pres
ent in "The Man Who Came to Sun
day Night. Supper on Friday Night
When They Weren't Serving It."
LAUNDRY POLICY
"We've finally cleaned this one up
enough so that we can use it," Mu
heim said. He added that the skit
characters include "a boor from Cal
and a bunch of smooth people from
Stanford."
"Does That Draft. Bother You?"
shows how your local draft board
operates, at the same time showing
j a "keen insight into this thing
called war," Muheim stated.
} "We cut 'Lay That Plate' out of
j the show last night," the director
i said, "People laughed at it—they
thought it was funny — they were
wrong. It. was slow, and would have
cobbed up the show."
In the line of specialty acts, the
omnipresent Shorty Grannis will re
veal what Roosevelt has been up to

lately. "We Take You Now to Lon
don" shows how people bomb
people.
SPECIALTY ACTS
Isabel Fawcett, as a Helen Hoskin
sonesque club women will give a
three-minute speech on "Culture,"
while the Zook twins in their allot
ted time do their best to disprove
Miss Fawcett's most basic conten
tions.
'Bud Cady is in and out of the
show all evening," Muheim con
cluded. "He winds up by being
out."
