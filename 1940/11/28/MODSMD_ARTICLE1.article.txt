### BOB LOW 
ominous note was j
sounded by a high British states
man yesterday when Arthur Green- j
wood, a member of Britain's inner
war cabinet, admitted in Parliament \
that the position of British ship
ping was "like that of April, 1917,"
which, it was admitted after the
war, was the nation's darkest mo
ment of World War 1.
This disclosure follows by only a
few days statements by Lord Lo
thian, ambassador to the United
States, and by Ronald Cross, min
ister of shipping, that indicate simi
larly that Britain's position today is
precarious.
Lord Lothian said that Britain's
cash reserve could not be expected
to hold out longer than six months
or a year, while Mr. Cross declared
that Britain's ship building facilities
wore inadequate to keep up with
the toll taken by German subma
rines.
"There are compensations in
new ships," Mr. Greenwood said
yesterday, "and we are doing all
wc can to increase home produc
tion. At the same time I am look
ing to an accretion of strength
from America."
But it is obvious that the United
States cannot help materially in re
placing British shipping losses at the
present time. Most consipcuous ob
stacle is, of course, America's lim
ited ship-building facilities.
As Leslie Hore-Belisha, former
war minister, pointed out in com
menting on Britain's position, Amer
ica during the year before the war
produced only 300,000 tons of mer
cantile tonnage. This is almost an
insignificant figure alongside of the
official figures of British shipping
losses during the present conflict.
In addition, the United States is
now producing ships for her own
small merchant marine.
Hore-Belisha said Britain's pro
gram for nc-w construction was
aimed at 1,350,000 tons a year and
that this "at the present rate of
sinkings would not see us through
15 weeks."
Certainly, if this is the case,
America cannot save Britain and
Hore-Belisha has recognized this.
The remedy, he says, is to cripple
Italy and force her out of the war,
an action for which "the Greeks have
opened the way with a swift series
of successes."

r J' , HE statements of Lothian, Hore-
Belisha, and Greenwood have
not gone unnoticed in the United
States, and it is possible that the
all-aid-short-of-war pressure groups
will make use of them from now on.
But pressure of this sort does not
build ships, and the repeal of the
Johnson Act likewise cannot
change the situation to any great
extent. Britain evidently needs more
ships than the United States can
supply her.

The Senate Foreign Relations
Committee yesterday reviewed the
issue of financial aid to Britain and
decided to shelve the matter until
the next session of Congress, on the
grounds that it did not yet require
attention.
Meanwhile another proposal
drew its share of comment in
Washington, Senator Gerald P.
Nye asked for a far-reaching sur
vey of British financial resources
in this country with the aim of de
termining the urgency of Brit
ain's needs at the present time.
Nye pointed out that British hold
ings in this country "have been de
clared to amount to five or six bil
lion dollars."

spokesmen in Berlin an
' nounced by surprise yesterday
that Bulgaria was not expected to
join the Axis alliance, as has been
predicted by authoritative observers
for some time.
If Bulgaria is actually to remain
outside of the Axis camp, this might
be taken as an indication that Rus
sia did not. make any far-reaching
commitment in the Molotov-Hitler
talks several weeks ago.
The Nazis have signed up with
Italy and Japan, and more recently
with Hungaiy, Slovakia, and Ru
mania.
