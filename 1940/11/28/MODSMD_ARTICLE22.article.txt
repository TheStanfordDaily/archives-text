## 
### 
It's "H<wr with '44*' today.
Slncc the cold hour of 6 this morn
ing truckloads of Encinaroen and
their plunder have l>ecn pounding
the highways In preparation for a
magnificent spectacle that will b«
touched of! at approximately 8:W
o'clock tonight.
Those sweating, slaving frosh arc
working with light hearts today —

they're going to rqast a burly
Grizzly over Stanford's Fiftieth Year
Big Gamp Bonfire.
"The higher the enthusiasm, the
higher the Bonfire," promised Chair
man Bob Breekner last night, fol
lowing erection of the giant tele
phone poles preparatory to today's
workout.
Freshmen are building their mas
sive pyre around a base of 10,00()
beer boxes, donated by a San Jow»
brewery. Breekner prophesied that
this year's Bonfire will be longer
than usual under construction, due
to the distance to be covered in
hauling the crates.
Details are complete, and tho
eventful day will proceed in well
planned cog-wheel fashion.
Oodles and oodles of luscious Roblc
women will do their part, toward
burning in effigy the California Benr
—they'll be out there serving hot
coffee and doughnuts for breakfast,
and later a tasty lunch, under the
direction of Pat Adams.
PINWHEEL CROWNS FIRE
Oil will drench the finished pyre,
and a giant pinwheel will crown the
whole works. Careful plans and
hard work are preparing "the finest
ever" for the satiation of 4.200 Stan
fordites eager for a certain bear
skin.
It's just like Breekner said last
night, "If advance enthusiasm is any
indication, this year's Bonfire will
be the finest, ever."
Committee heads are Dick Wells,
trucking and scouting; Chuck Smith,
entertainment and fireworks; Pat
Adams, food; and Bill Korener, con
struction.
Trucking and scouting committee
consists of BUI Howell, Bud Agnew,
Tommy Howard, Dave Doud, Rusk
Vail, Stan Lee, Tim Driscoll, Jack
Euphrat, John Shores, Irving Hell
man, Roscoe Jones, and Boh
Stampley.
Construction committee includes
Doug McDonald, Jim Haugh, Ray
Durham, Dick Lyon, Jack Boyd,
Sandy Tatum, Ralph Thompson, Bob
Snoddy, Charlie Bull, Bill Smith,
Roy McClory, Bob Shiner, Ray
Chapot, Bob McNeil, and George
Jackson.
Return of the Bonfire to its tra
ditional site in the Lagunlta lake
bed was assured this year by a joint
! pact signed by Bnice Jessup,
A.S.S.U. president, and Breekner,
with the Administration.
The agreement, promised to cur
tial unnecessary noise before and
after the Bonfire is burning, and t(»
prevent so-called "Robin hysteria."
| The lake bed is a probationary aite,
depending on student conduct, ac
cording to the tripartite conven
, tion.

PINWHEEL CROWNS FIRE
Oil will drench the finished pyre,
and a giant pinwheel will crown the
whole works. Careful plans and
hard work are preparing "the finest
ever" for the satiation of 4.200 Stan
fordites eager for a certain bear
skin.
It's just like Breekner said last
night, "If advance enthusiasm is any
indication, this year's Bonfire will
be the finest, ever."
Committee heads are Dick Wells,
trucking and scouting; Chuck Smith,
entertainment and fireworks; Pat
Adams, food; and Bill Korener, con
struction.
Trucking and scouting committee
consists of BUI Howell, Bud Agnew,
Tommy Howard, Dave Doud, Rusk
Vail, Stan Lee, Tim Driscoll, Jack
Euphrat, John Shores, Irving Hell
man, Roscoe Jones, and Boh
Stampley.
Construction committee includes
Doug McDonald, Jim Haugh, Ray
Durham, Dick Lyon, Jack Boyd,
Sandy Tatum, Ralph Thompson, Bob
Snoddy, Charlie Bull, Bill Smith,
Roy McClory, Bob Shiner, Ray
Chapot, Bob McNeil, and George
Jackson.
Return of the Bonfire to its tra
ditional site in the Lagunlta lake
bed was assured this year by a joint
! pact signed by Bnice Jessup,
A.S.S.U. president, and Breekner,
with the Administration.
The agreement, promised to cur
tial unnecessary noise before and
after the Bonfire is burning, and t(»
prevent so-called "Robin hysteria."
| The lake bed is a probationary aite,
depending on student conduct, ac
cording to the tripartite conven
, tion.
It's "H<wr with '44*' today.
Slncc the cold hour of 6 this morn
ing truckloads of Encinaroen and
their plunder have l>ecn pounding
the highways In preparation for a
magnificent spectacle that will b«
touched of! at approximately 8:W
o'clock tonight.
Those sweating, slaving frosh arc
working with light hearts today —

they're going to rqast a burly
Grizzly over Stanford's Fiftieth Year
Big Gamp Bonfire.
"The higher the enthusiasm, the
higher the Bonfire," promised Chair
man Bob Breekner last night, fol
lowing erection of the giant tele
phone poles preparatory to today's
workout.
Freshmen are building their mas
sive pyre around a base of 10,00()
beer boxes, donated by a San Jow»
brewery. Breekner prophesied that
this year's Bonfire will be longer
than usual under construction, due
to the distance to be covered in
hauling the crates.
Details are complete, and tho
eventful day will proceed in well
planned cog-wheel fashion.
Oodles and oodles of luscious Roblc
women will do their part, toward
burning in effigy the California Benr
—they'll be out there serving hot
coffee and doughnuts for breakfast,
and later a tasty lunch, under the
direction of Pat Adams.
