# Farm joins in National Christmas Seal Campaign
## 
### 
Once more the scourge against
tuberculosis will be brought to the
public eye as this week the annual
Christmas Seal sale gets under way.
Stanford, playing its part in the na
tionwide campaign, yesterday sent
Nancy Mann, Pi Phi '43, to San Jose
;.s representative to a meeting of
lhe School Committee for Christ
mas Seal sale in Santa Clara county.

Emphasis was
laid specifically on
the importance of
university and col
lege participation in
this sale, the in
come of which is
the sole support of
the Santa Clara
Tuberculosis Asso
ciation which is af
filiated with the na-

tielp to Protect tional organization.
)o ur Home front Subseq uently
Tuberculosis plans were made
for a Christmas Seal Drive to be
held on the campuses of Stanford
tind Santa Clara Universities. At
the Farm, seals will go on sale this
W< ok at the Post Office.
As always, the need is very great
i'ua year. Tuberculosis, prime cause
u youthful deaths between the ages
»if 15 and 35, -according o the San

Jose committee is especially preva
lent in California. Recent statistical
surveys show that there is no sec
tion of the state that has escaped
the disease. As a cause of death, it
is the greatest single factor in all
age groups in California.
However, the work of the Cali
fornia Tuberculosis Association
working in conjunction with the na
tional association has made great
progress in the prevention and cure
of tuberculosis.
Twenty years ago, tuberculosis
was responsible for 11 out of every
100 deaths in California; today that
margin has been cut to 5.
Ine money raised from the annual
sale of Christmas seals affords sci
entific research the financial means
to carry on its work. According to
experts, tuberculosis in this nation
can not only be brought under con
trol, but can ultimately be wiped
out entirely.
Stanford's part in this national
campaign will therefore be similar
to that of colleges and universities
all over the country. Contrary to the
usual procedure, the drive will not
be conducted by individuals can
vassing living groups this year, but
will consist so!et> of the sale a* the
Post Office.

i'ua year. Tuberculosis, prime cause
u youthful deaths between the ages
»if 15 and 35, -according o the San

Jose committee is especially preva
lent in California. Recent statistical
surveys show that there is no sec
tion of the state that has escaped
the disease. As a cause of death, it
is the greatest single factor in all
age groups in California.
However, the work of the Cali
fornia Tuberculosis Association
working in conjunction with the na
tional association has made great
progress in the prevention and cure
of tuberculosis.
Twenty years ago, tuberculosis
was responsible for 11 out of every
100 deaths in California; today that
margin has been cut to 5.
Ine money raised from the annual
sale of Christmas seals affords sci
entific research the financial means
to carry on its work. According to
experts, tuberculosis in this nation
can not only be brought under con
trol, but can ultimately be wiped
out entirely.
Stanford's part in this national
campaign will therefore be similar
to that of colleges and universities
all over the country. Contrary to the
usual procedure, the drive will not
be conducted by individuals can
vassing living groups this year, but
will consist so!et> of the sale a* the
Post Office.

tuberculosis will be brought to the
public eye as this week the annual
Christmas Seal sale gets under way.
