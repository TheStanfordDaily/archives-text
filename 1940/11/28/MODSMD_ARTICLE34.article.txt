## 
### 
Students in colleges all over the i
United States are becoming more in- !
terested in contemporary world poli- j
lies, according to John A. Stevenson, j
guest speaker at Luncheon Club yes- I
terday.
"There is no vital difference in stu
dent attitude and opinion between
one legion and another," said the ;
speaker, basing his views on recent !
tours of middlewest, coast, and mid- I
die Atlantic campuses.
Thoughtful students, should begin I
now to prepare for the disordered I
world into which they will be grad- 1
uated, he said.
He commended the work of stu- !
dent groups in the solving of local i
problems, such as co-operative hous- j
ing and Community Chest. Small ;
fellowship groups and church groups,
he said, were most active in this j
type of work.
