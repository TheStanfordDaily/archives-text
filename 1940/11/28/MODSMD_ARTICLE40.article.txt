# Bears Play Soccermen To Deadlock
## 
### 
Tlie Stanford and California soc
cer teams battled away for four
quarters yesterday, and when the
final whistle blew both teams were
in a 0-0 deadlock. Thus the Con
ference standings were left up to
Saturday's game at Berkeley, which
will find both teams battling again.
But though the score belies it,
there was plenty of action through
out the entile game. Both teams
were playing their -bos 4 ball, and
only sensational work by the goalies
and the defending fullbacks kept
the teams from scoring.
The Bears came out onto the field
with a rush, and looked like they
were going to sweep the Indians off
their feet. But as the quarter wore
on, the Indian defense tightened up
to hold the Bears at bay.
Stanford came close to scoring
time alter time, but was denied
only because of the ineffective
shooting of the forwards.
GAME OPENS UP
In the second half 'the game
opened up, and it looked like some
one would score, but no one did.
Late in the fourth period Stanford's
George La Nicca took a perfect pass
from Georgie Dole, got past the last
defending Bear defender and seemed
to be haded for a goal, but he got
going so fast he missed his shot.
Coach Maloney had praise for all
his boys, especially Goalie Jack
Burns. Burns was truly sensational
the way he handled drives at the
Stanford goal, and more than once
he stopped a certain California
score.
Sensational also was the heads-up
play of the two fullbacks, Dick
Harmon and Ned Pugh. Pugh, with
his towering kicks, put California
in the hole more than once.
La N'cca and Dole played their
usual stellar games, as did the ever
consistent Wilson Clark. A surprise
started in today's game was little
A1 Wool, who took over the wing
position. Wool played throughout
the first half, showing a fiery, in
spirational game.

Late in the fourth period Stanford's
George La Nicca took a perfect pass
from Georgie Dole, got past the last
defending Bear defender and seemed
to be haded for a goal, but he got
going so fast he missed his shot.
Coach Maloney had praise for all
his boys, especially Goalie Jack
Burns. Burns was truly sensational
the way he handled drives at the
Stanford goal, and more than once
he stopped a certain California
score.
Sensational also was the heads-up
play of the two fullbacks, Dick
Harmon and Ned Pugh. Pugh, with
his towering kicks, put California
in the hole more than once.
La N'cca and Dole played their
usual stellar games, as did the ever
consistent Wilson Clark. A surprise
started in today's game was little
A1 Wool, who took over the wing
position. Wool played throughout
the first half, showing a fiery, in
spirational game.
