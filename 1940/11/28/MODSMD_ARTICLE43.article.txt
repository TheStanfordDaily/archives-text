## JERRY BRUCKER, Sports Editor Shaughnessy's Warriors Fire Up for Cal Clash 
### 
Out cn the varsity football practice field yesterday things really began
to bum in typical pre-Big Game fashion. The Indians' lire and spirit is
definitely on the upswing and roaring toward a crowning crescendo come
Saturday afternoon.
Coach Clark Shaughnessy's Warriors showed more pep, zip. and chatter

han at any previous practice session
md the whole drill was marked by ,
Irive and precision.
Otherwise the news concerning j
he Cards' preparation for the one j
md only Big Game with Cal was !
nuch the same. B"ig Norm Standlee's j
:ondition was much the same as it \
vas on Tuesday, and the Chief Uni
ted his activities to sprinting up ;
md down the sidelines.
STANDLEE HINDERED
Though the swelling in Standlee's
inkle has gone down appreciably, it j
s still rather stiff and sore, and the
lefty fullback is unable to start in
\ hurry or do any dodging or cut
ing.
Continuing the style set earlier in j
he week, the Cards divided their i
ime between offensive and defensive j
irills. Shaughnessy and his staff of
nasterminds are nursing along their
r-formation, and it is sure to reach
its high point of deceptivcness and i
effectiveness against the Bears.
California's pass defense has been j
ixceptionally weak this year and the j
Bears have been beaten more than
ance by aerial thrusts. Therefore it
is certain that Frankie Albert and
bis capable left arm will see plenty
r>f action up at Cal next Saturday
afternoon.
OFFENSIVE PASSING
Evidence of this fact is the of
fensive passing drills Shaughnessy
has sent his team through this week.
Along with Albert, Thor Peterson
and Ray Hammett have been doing
the pitching, and the busy receivers
have been Freddie Meyer, Clemmie
Tommerlin, Stan Graff, Hugh Gal
larneau, Pete Kmetovic, A1 Cole, and
Eric Armstrong.
If Standlee is on the sidelines for
Saturday's game, the Indians will
start a team containing only two
graduating seniors which is some
sort of a record and certain indica-t
tion of the big things to come in
Stanford football. As it is the seniors
eligible for captain of Saturday's
game is limited to only three regu
lars, Gallarneau, Graff, and Stand
lee.
Under usual circumstances the
idea of starting a team with a total
of six sophomores would seem to
indicate that Stanford's was a green
and inexperienced team. But those
sophomores, the linemen in particu
lar, are going to show the Bears that
they know an awful lot for first-year
men.
More than 25 North Carolina in
dustries are dependent upon raw
materials supplied by the state's
forests, a State Department of Con
servation survey shows.
