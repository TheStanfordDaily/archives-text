Parking Lot field.
For 89.9 minutes the frosh were
the victors, but with seconds to go
Cal took the ball the length of the
field and after a short struggle

The locals were led by the all- ;
field play of Jack Pagen, center and j
right half. Along with being a j
defensive giant and feeding the ball ;
continually to the forward wall,
he scoltd the Cards' second goal ;
on a long but perfectly placed kick.
CIIANG MAIN THREAT

main offensive threat, booting!
through two of his team's three ;
scores.

goal area and forced a Cal man to j
push the ball through his own goal. ;
A short while later the Bearbabes j
tied the score up at one all, which
it remained until the end of the '

midway in the third period, while !
; the Indian reserves could not gen
jerate a score.
TWO QUICK GOALS

! the start of the final period, the
local boys struck twice in quick
succession to take a 3-2 lead. Pa
gen, only Stanford man to play the ,
entire game, made good a penalty j
kick givep him. This was followed
by a goal scored by E. K. Hartley

j Little Indians will be at full strength
i with Captain Dick Diebenkorn,
Hank Peters, Bob Sol, and Jose Rey '
' back in good shape.
The Bear Cub socccrmen had to
stage a "Frank Mcrriwell" liuish to
tie the improved Papoo.sc kickers,
3-3, yesterday afternoon on the
Parking Lot field.
For 89.9 minutes the frosh were
the victors, but with seconds to go
Cal took the ball the length of the
field and after a short struggle
booted it into the goal.
The locals were led by the all- ;
field play of Jack Pagen, center and j
right half. Along with being a j
defensive giant and feeding the ball ;
continually to the forward wall,
he scoltd the Cards' second goal ;
on a long but perfectly placed kick.
CIIANG MAIN THREAT
Harry Chang was the visitors' i
main offensive threat, booting!
through two of his team's three ;
scores.
The Redskins' first score came 1
When Jere McWethy rushed into the .
goal area and forced a Cal man to j
push the ball through his own goal. ;
A short while later the Bearbabes j
tied the score up at one all, which
it remained until the end of the '
half.
Coach Tefvik Sadullah sent the
second string in to start the second
half. Chang made his second score I
midway in the third period, while !
; the Indian reserves could not gen
jerate a score.
TWO QUICK GOALS
With the first string back in at j
! the start of the final period, the
local boys struck twice in quick
succession to take a 3-2 lead. Pa
gen, only Stanford man to play the ,
entire game, made good a penalty j
kick givep him. This was followed
by a goal scored by E. K. Hartley
on a pass from Rey.

"blitzkrieg" by the Bears in the last
I minute.
