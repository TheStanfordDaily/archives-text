ACTING swiftly to clarify the status of Stan
ford "night raiders" who violated the offi
cial Big Game peace pact, Men's Council met in
extraordinary session last night to sentence 24
Encinamen who painted the "C" last Sunday.
There was no compulsory attendance. The
24 appeared voluntarily after it was announced
that such a meeting would be held. And when
the small but vocal rooting section of frosh that
gathered ouside Old Union had dispersed there
was little excitement.
Men's Council and Stanford men, Class of
'44, had a bull session.
They decided that insufficient notice had been
given freshmen that the "unfriendly acts" were,
actually, subject to severe penalty. This lack of
appreciation for the gravity of the offense was
due to inadequate information made available to
freshmen. Once they understood the situation,
they agreed that their penalties were merited.
If thirty hours of work sounds like a rough
load, it might be well to consider other sen
tences that could be imposed. A consideration
of such sentences leads to an evaluation of the
whole delicately balanced machinery of the
Farm's judicial system.
Men's Council, at its inception, was delegated
authority from the President of the University.
The fundamental root of that authority still rests
with the Administration. Try as you may to
dodge it, the issue remains—Men's Council is
responsible, ultimately, to the men who run
Stanford University, a private educational in
stitution. If the Administration chooses not to
approve Men's Council action, the authority of
that body is worth about as much as a Rose
Bowl ticket in the cold, grey dawn of January 2.
Men's Council, in making a strong and rea
sonable stand, accepted its responsibility to deal
with student offenses. It left no doubt, as the
result of its work last night, that lax student
officialdom would lose its authority to punish
any and all violators.
Taken out of the hands of students, the pun
ishment that might have been meted out by a
less sympathetic Administration would have
been far from lenient. With this year's practical
lesson safely tucked away, the current crop
of freshmen can think over the possible conse
quences of their actions. Maybe, from their ex
perience, they'll remember to tell the Class
of '45:
"Take it easy."

ford "night raiders" who violated the offi
cial Big Game peace pact, Men's Council met in
extraordinary session last night to sentence 24
Encinamen who painted the "C" last Sunday.
There was no compulsory attendance. The
24 appeared voluntarily after it was announced
that such a meeting would be held. And when
the small but vocal rooting section of frosh that
gathered ouside Old Union had dispersed there
was little excitement.
Men's Council and Stanford men, Class of
'44, had a bull session.
They decided that insufficient notice had been
given freshmen that the "unfriendly acts" were,
actually, subject to severe penalty. This lack of
appreciation for the gravity of the offense was
due to inadequate information made available to
freshmen. Once they understood the situation,
they agreed that their penalties were merited.
If thirty hours of work sounds like a rough
load, it might be well to consider other sen
tences that could be imposed. A consideration
of such sentences leads to an evaluation of the
whole delicately balanced machinery of the
Farm's judicial system.
Men's Council, at its inception, was delegated
authority from the President of the University.
The fundamental root of that authority still rests
with the Administration. Try as you may to
dodge it, the issue remains—Men's Council is
responsible, ultimately, to the men who run
Stanford University, a private educational in
stitution. If the Administration chooses not to
approve Men's Council action, the authority of
that body is worth about as much as a Rose
Bowl ticket in the cold, grey dawn of January 2.
Men's Council, in making a strong and rea
sonable stand, accepted its responsibility to deal
with student offenses. It left no doubt, as the
result of its work last night, that lax student
officialdom would lose its authority to punish
any and all violators.
Taken out of the hands of students, the pun
ishment that might have been meted out by a
less sympathetic Administration would have
been far from lenient. With this year's practical
lesson safely tucked away, the current crop
of freshmen can think over the possible conse
quences of their actions. Maybe, from their ex
perience, they'll remember to tell the Class
of '45:
"Take it easy."
