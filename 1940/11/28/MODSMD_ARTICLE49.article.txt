# The 						American Privilege
## 
### 
IF ANY American still needed proof of the
privilege it is to live in this country, the recent
strike at the Vultee airplane plant in southern
California should have dispelled all doubts.
Many reactionary thinkers and perhaps a few
liberal ones—undoubtedly resented the strike
action on the part of the Vultee workers to bar
gain for a "decent living wage." Last June a
North Carolina Congressman told striking ship
yard workers at Kearney that "this is no time
lor labor to try and grab off 10 cents an hour
more."
A Senator from Georgia, on hearing of the
Kearney demands for an additional 10 cents an
hour, hysterically hollered, "Treason." If such
sentiments were in force five months ago when
our "national emergency" was less pronounced
than it is at present, there can be little doubt
that even a greater number of persons reflect
these views now. To them the action on the
tage America's defense program. It was a
tage American's defense program. It was a
case of the workers taking advantage of an in
dustrial enterprise which was not in a position
to fight back due to the integral defense func
tions it was performing.
The strike ended last Tuesday after 12 days
duration with the workers receiving a compro
mise basic wage of 62Vt cents an hour, paid
vacation, sick leave, and increased pay for be
ginners. The company in turn received a two
year no-strike clause in the contract.
Whether the settlement was just or not is not
the main point of this editorial, although we
think it was, to say the least. The Wall Street
Journal estimated last summer that the eight
largest airplane companies in the U. S. would
receive an average profits increase of 15.3 per
cent from their national defense contracts. A
conscriptee, who certainly is doing his best in
the national defense program, receives no such
compensation for his well-meant and impor
tant services.
It is a basic principle of democratic govern
ment that labor and capital shall work hand in
hand for the benefit of the nation. When the
aircraft factories receive their share of the prof
its, perhaps the workers are not out of line

asking 62 Vz cents an hour in order to com
fortably raise their families in the American
way of life.
But above all, this strike should serve as a
graphic, vivid illustration of America's system.
The strikers should realize that under a totali
tarian regime their organization for collective
bargaining would be destroyed. They would
be a vast herd of unguided skills directed by
the whims of the government.
The airplane factory officials should under
stand that under a dictatorship they would be
mere agents 01 the siaie. There would be no
chance for compromise as there was in the
Vultee strike.
Whether, as has been alleged, Communism
was involved in the Vultee strike or not we do
not know. We do know that it is a desperate
privilege to live in a country where striking,
compromise, and mediation are possible.—G.M.
