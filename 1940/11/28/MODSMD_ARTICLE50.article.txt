STANFORD IS UNDER HIS SKIN
JT'S phenomenal the rapidity with which you or any
body else becomes attached to this Farm. It just up
and happens, quicker than Superman late for a date.
From the moment you step or are pushed off at the
Palo Alto station you sort of feel that you own a
small hunk of Stanford, a hunk that is expressly
yours. The next day you may flunk the Aptitude Test
and get shipped home. Or maybe any one of a dozen
things happens, and you don't get in.
That doesn't seem to matter. You are and always
consider yourself a part of the Stanford family. And
whether you were here four days or forty years, you
will always go running around to help another Stan
fordite.

of which is a way of paying a compliment to
one Dick Payne, who for reasons unknown has
not been able to return to the Farm, to finish college
with his Class of '42. But Dick keeps thinking about
Stanford, and so when he read a recent plea for an
inexpensive New Year's evening in Los Angeles, he
went way out of his way to help the Stanford family.
This is just a suggestion, but as Dick puts it: "If
Cardinals, or any other Stanford organization, wants
to hold such a party, may I suggest that they begin
making arrangements now."
He did a little investigation on your behalf and
these are his forwarded results and conclusions:
"1. If a hotel has but one ballroom, they don't want
to rent because they can make more otherwise. This
includes the Vista del Arroyo (Pasadena), the Bev
erly Wilshire and maybe the Hollywood Roosevelt.
"2. The large country clubs have already made ar
rangements for the use of their ballrooms. In this
group are the Annandale (Pasadena) and the Mid
wick (South Pasadena). It would be safe to assume
that most of the country clubs would be obliged to
hold New Year's parties for their members."

only positive result of Dick's inquiries was re
ceived from the Biltmore Hotel. They have avail
able their Blue Ballroom, which would accommodate
500 couples. The room has been tentatively arranged
for, but the word from Stanford might turn the trick
if it had the money behind it. They said they would
like to take care of the Stanford crowd if they could.
The ballroom includes a nice lounge and a bar. The
fee, $350.
One other thing about the Biltmore. With dinner
they would charge $5 per person and would include
the rental in this. Then there would be the orchestra
to find.
Dick winds up his meaty message with two post
scripts. First, that he would suggest a dance without
any dinner, and secondly that the rent for 500 couples
would be 35 cents per personâ€”rather inexpensive.
