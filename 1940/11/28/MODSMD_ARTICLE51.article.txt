# CAMPUS OPINION
## THE 						BAND SPEAKS 
### 
r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
The B.A.C. docs not seem seriously disturbed by
the potshots being taken at its game ticket policy, so
it will probably not mind being made the scapegoat
for a few other sins. Our squawk is in behalf of the
band, us red-coated horn-tooters who do our best to
add a little color, a little spirit, and, occasionally, a
little music to a good many of Stanford's activities.
We devote four or five hours a week to the earning
of one unit of credit. On registration day we buy
student body cards at the usual retail price, but on
our cards all the football games are punched out in
advance in order that we may pay for the privilege of
performing during the game. We sit in the worst seats
in the house, and if anyone doubts it let him try watch
ing a game from the ground level. We look uphill
toward the scene of action, and whenever a miscel
laneous group of managers, photographers, and as
sorted free list gets out of the way we get a tolerably
good view of the play on one end. This explains why
we think Graft, Meyer, and Tomerlin are Stanford's
best football players.
In return for all this the band doesn't have to pay
extra to see Cal and U.S.C., and we get a trip to L.A.
with expenses paid. '"Oho," you and four thousand
others say enviously, "they get a free trip to L.A. What
are those guys complaining about, anyway?" Well, our
expense money, judiciously expended, will buy three
or four meals and get our uniforms cleaned.
Comparison, they say, is odious, but it might be
mentioned that the band of Southern Methodist Uni
versity, where twenty thousand is the biggest football
crowd of the season, travels six thousand miles a year,
visiting both Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and when they
arrive at a game they don't have to sleep in Pullman
cars parked in some Godforsaken comer of a railroad
yard. We don't object to being lulled to sleep by the
snorting and clanking of switch engines, but we do
worry a little lest our car get picked up by mistake,
and switched off to the loading dock of some southern
California jute mill.
All this, however, is chronic stuff to give background
to our current squawk. Every year on the Friday be
fore the Big Game the band heroically eschews the
Gaieties and goes up to the cily to play for a radio
rally. The B.A.C. hires a bus for this excursion, and
it is one of the band's favorite events, one to which
it looks forward all Fall Quarter. It happens that Sher
man Clay owns "Come Join the Band" and this year
they won't let us play it over the air for reasons which
elude reasonable explanation.
We have plenty of other school tunes, but the B.A.C.
apparently thinks that the impossibility of playing
"Come Join" furnishes a perfect opportunity to econ
omize on bus fare. So, on Tuesday, much too late to
get Gaieties tickets, we find our radio rally is off. We
don't like it much, but we can't do anything about it
except bounce scathing letters off the B.A.C.'s im
penetrable hide.

man Clay owns "Come Join the Band" and this year
they won't let us play it over the air for reasons which
elude reasonable explanation.
We have plenty of other school tunes, but the B.A.C.
apparently thinks that the impossibility of playing
"Come Join" furnishes a perfect opportunity to econ
omize on bus fare. So, on Tuesday, much too late to
get Gaieties tickets, we find our radio rally is off. We
don't like it much, but we can't do anything about it
except bounce scathing letters off the B.A.C.'s im
penetrable hide.

r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
The B.A.C. docs not seem seriously disturbed by
the potshots being taken at its game ticket policy, so
it will probably not mind being made the scapegoat
for a few other sins. Our squawk is in behalf of the
band, us red-coated horn-tooters who do our best to
add a little color, a little spirit, and, occasionally, a
little music to a good many of Stanford's activities.
We devote four or five hours a week to the earning
of one unit of credit. On registration day we buy
student body cards at the usual retail price, but on
our cards all the football games are punched out in
advance in order that we may pay for the privilege of
performing during the game. We sit in the worst seats
in the house, and if anyone doubts it let him try watch
ing a game from the ground level. We look uphill
toward the scene of action, and whenever a miscel
laneous group of managers, photographers, and as
sorted free list gets out of the way we get a tolerably
good view of the play on one end. This explains why
we think Graft, Meyer, and Tomerlin are Stanford's
best football players.
In return for all this the band doesn't have to pay
extra to see Cal and U.S.C., and we get a trip to L.A.
with expenses paid. '"Oho," you and four thousand
others say enviously, "they get a free trip to L.A. What
are those guys complaining about, anyway?" Well, our
expense money, judiciously expended, will buy three
or four meals and get our uniforms cleaned.
Comparison, they say, is odious, but it might be
mentioned that the band of Southern Methodist Uni
versity, where twenty thousand is the biggest football
crowd of the season, travels six thousand miles a year,
visiting both Atlantic and Pacific coasts, and when they
arrive at a game they don't have to sleep in Pullman
cars parked in some Godforsaken comer of a railroad
yard. We don't object to being lulled to sleep by the
snorting and clanking of switch engines, but we do
worry a little lest our car get picked up by mistake,
and switched off to the loading dock of some southern
California jute mill.
All this, however, is chronic stuff to give background
to our current squawk. Every year on the Friday be
fore the Big Game the band heroically eschews the
Gaieties and goes up to the cily to play for a radio
rally. The B.A.C. hires a bus for this excursion, and
it is one of the band's favorite events, one to which
it looks forward all Fall Quarter. It happens that Sher
man Clay owns "Come Join the Band" and this year
they won't let us play it over the air for reasons which
