# Sayao Voice, Manner Thrill S.F. Audience
## 
### 
Presenting a program almost iden
tical to that which she sang for her
Stanford audience just a year ago,
the Brazilian soprano, Bidu Sayao,
had her first opportunity to prove to
San Francisco's music lovers that she
was as consummate a concert artist
as she was a Manon or a Mimi.
Prove this she did without a
doubt, for during the evening the
petite soprano was brought back to
the stage for no less than ten en
cores, which ranged from the charm
ing song by Buzzi-Peccia, "Colum
betta," to the Gavotte from Mas
senet's "Manon," from the dramatic
aria "Un Bel Di" from Puccini's
"Madame Butterfly," to the difficult
bit of colorutura work by Delibes,
"Filles de Cadiz." She showed again
in her San Francisco concert the
same fine artistry and charming
stage presence which impressed her
Stanford audience last year.
FRENCH SONGS
The program was composed first
of a group from the eighteenth cen
tury, including "My Mother Bids Me
Bind My Hair" of Haydn, which Miss
Sayao sang in English, concluding
the group with the favorite aria from
"Rigoletto," "Caro Nome." Next
followed a group of French songs
which ranged from the pensive
"Pourquoi Rester Sculette" of Saint-
Saens to the colorutura show piece,
"Villanella," by DeH'Acqua.
Perhaps Miss Sayao was most at
home in the next selection, the
Waltz from "Romeo and Juliette"
which she sang with a lightness and
beauty of tonal quality which is
usually lacking in modem interpre
tations of this aria. The encores for
this group were the "Manon" Ga
votte and the aria from "Butterfly,"
which showed that the singer could
use her usually lyric voice for dra
matic music to great advantage. The
intermission was followed by a
group of Italian and Brazilian songs,
and the concluding group was made
up of English songs delivered in a
very intimate fashion.
ACCOMPANIST MISSES
If there was anything about the
concert that was shoi't of perfection
it was in the accompaniments by
Milne Charnley, who still has a tend
ency to force the tempo slightly, and
who fails to completely back up the
singer in* the more dramatic selec
tions.â€”Moran
