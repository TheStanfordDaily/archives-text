# Weary Frosh Pyre Builders Buoyed Up by Robleites, Food
## 
### 
Soup's on, frosh!
And there won't have to be a second call after those weary freshmen,
slaving on the bonfire, see who their waitresses arc. For behind the food
will be 20 Rohle queens.
The frosh women arc Annette Long, Lorce Meek. Patsy Weiss, Pat
Chubbuck, Bev Humphries, Barbara Sanborn, Kay Schwartz, Phil Swing,

Elizabeth Terry, and Daisy Day.
Other food slingers are Mary Etta
Fagan, Ann Gallery, Betty May Hale,
Fran Harrison, Nancy Haskins,
Diane Holmes, Joan Kibbey, Sis
Larkin, and Betty Jane Tweedy.
For breakfast, served between 7:30
and 8 o'clock, the pyre builders will
not have much to choose from. But
those 30 dozen doughnuts and gal
lons of coffee should taste mighty
good to those freshmen who have
gadded about since early morn in
search of bonfire material.
LUNCH AT 11:30
Lunch will be served from 11:30
to 12:30 o'clock. The menu: sand
wiches, potato salad, milk, ice cream
and cookies. Service tables will be
located between the bonfire and the
Boathouse.
But the Class of '44 aren't doing
all the work for this affair. The
hundreds of sandwiches will be
prepared this morning by the so
rorities and each fraternity is fur
nishing one gallon of milk.
FOOD DONATED
The Rainbow Doughnut Shop of
Redwood City is donating the
doughnuts. Coffee is furnished by
the Indian Drive Inn, cookies by
the National Biscuit Company, and
ice by the Palo Alto Ice Company.
Pat Adams is in charge of the
repast, assisted by Jean Crook, Carol
Rhodes, Carol Edwards, Elizabeth
Eastman, Ruth Anne Green, Ann
Bossinger, Hays Busch and Bob
Hampton.
