The Shirt that Knows
P.M. Etiquette
Does your dress shirt look as if you've been on a
War Dance along about midnight? Pleats caved in
like an accordion? Tsk! Tsk! Manhattans ... black or
white tie ... never act up that way. Bosoms stay crum
ple- and criticism-proof, collars maintain a well-be
haved attitude. That's because of the fine cloth used in
tailoring them, followed by skilled workmanship (of
real interest to you only for its marathon results!)
