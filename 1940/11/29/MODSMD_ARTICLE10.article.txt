# Game Dance Culminates Hectic Week
## S. F. Country Club To Provide Ground For Free Parking 
### 
Rally, parade, bonfire, spirit, THE
BIG GAME!
And to climax this tremendous
surge of football mania which is
'sweeping the campus is the Big
Game Dance.
An exclusively Stanford crowd, a
Stanford orchcslra, football decora
tions and the traditional Axe make
this the best bet for joyous Stan
fordites to celebrate this most
eventual week in campus history.
The BiGame Dance, now well
on its way to becoming a real tra
dition, will be held at the San Fran
cisco Golf and Country Club on
Junipero Serra Boulevard at the
San Mateo - San Francisco county
line.

For directions on how to reach
the club from either the campus,
down-town San Francisco, or the
Bay Bridge, see the map printed
below.
The orchestra will be under the
masterful baton of Freddy Nagel,
Stanford '36, who promises that he
will be as elated as all the dancers
on that eventful night and that his
music will be in just the right mood
for a crowd of hoarse but happy
dancers.
Besides abundant free parking fa
cilities the club will furnish two
lounge rooms where anyone attend
ing the dance may change to the
appropriate semi-formal attire.
There will be three large rooms and
an outdoor patio for dancing.

Bids for the Big flame Dance
are slill on sale at the A.S.S.U.
office for $3.00 per couple. Chair
man Boh Beckham requests that
all those planning to attend the
dance purchase bids before this
afternoon. They will also be on
sale at the door.
