Coach Clark Shaughncssy this year
has carried on the tradition of all
Stanford coaches in their first sea
son at Stanford in a rather impres
sive fashion. Pop Warner,* during
his first year here, installed the class

maintained it and was blessed with
a crew of "Vowing Sophs'' who
went to the Rose Bowl.
