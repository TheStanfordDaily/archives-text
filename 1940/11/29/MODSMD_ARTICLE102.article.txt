# Psychology Favors Bears, Claims Cal Sport Editor
## Berkeley Scribe Avoids Game Prediction, Praises Allison 
### BRUCE LEE (Daily Californian Sports Editor 
You tell me who's going to win the Big Game.
Oh sure, I have a hunch—a hunch that points to California
as the ultimate victor. That surprising conclusion is reached
mainly on the basis of the peculiar psychology set up in the
mind of a team preceding each Big Game. Also, by deduc
tion is probably helped along by no little amount of prejudice.
Whoever wins, the coach of the team will really have a
record of which to boast. Whoever loses, the coach of that
team need not count the season as ruined.
Reams have been written in praise of the "miracles" that \
! Clark Shaughnessy has wrought down there at Stanford. My |
| adding to those tributes to Shaughnessy won't make much dif- !
I ference in his stack of clippings one way or the other, but at j
I least I'd like to go on record as reiterating everything laudatory 1
] that has been said about the job he has done.
But you know, with all the publicity drums beating out the j
! rhythm of Clark Shaughnessy's name, the work that. Stub
I Allison has been doing here at Berkeley has been noticed only
J too little.
ALLISON'S JOB
And it was and is a great piece of work. The Stubber took
a team, demoralized, down-hearted, trampled upon, beaten in
every sense of the word, and brought it up to a point where it
is considered one of the strongest—now second, perhaps, only 1
to Stanford (and we'll see about that!)—teams on the coast.
Perhaps Stub's record isn't as wonderful to behold on the
Pacific Coast Conference books as is that of Shaughnessy's,
but in the minds of every Californian who has seen this fighting I
?ang of Golden Bears overcome every kind of handicap pos- !
sible, I'll bet Stub's mark stands as high as does Clark's.
Stanford's in a position where they're tight as a drum j
head. They've got an unbeaten record to maintain. They're j
heavy favorites. They're going to the Bowl; they need a clean !
record for that.
SET FOR UPSET
Cailfornia is, inversely, in a remarkable position for an 1
upset. The Bears arc on their way up. They've had a taste of |
blood and they like it very much; they want more. They'll '
face the famous T formation they've heard so much about,
that's baffled every other opponent on the Coast. Yes, Cali
fornia is on a peak, ready to prove to the football world that
Stanford can be beaten, that the ignition to the Indians' Model T
can be short-circuited.
Now about the personnel of the two squads. The Cards are .
1 moulded into a smooth-functioning unit, with heavy emphasis
on the first string. So it is with California, and that smooth- j
| runing combination wasn't found until the U.S.C. game.
! CONDITION GOOD
With the possible exception of Big Chief Norm Standlee, 1
Stanford is in about the best condition of the year, especially ;
, since they've had a week in which to rest and prepare. So it
, is with California. For the first time this .season the roster of
, the Golden Bears is complete, all men present and accounted for.
On the line, the Cards have a very tough first string, with
i several men possible All-Coast selections, namely, Fred Meyer,
; Vic Lindskog, Bruno Banducci, and Chuck Taylor.
Similarly, California has some standouts in the forward wall.
Bob Reinhard, All-American candidate, is the outstanding man,
I but George Herrero, Chuck Donohoe, Harlen Gough, and Mot -
ley Mathewson may receive mention on more than one All-
Coast eleven.
INDIAN BACKS
Stanford, in the backfield, has a plunging fullback. Norm
Standlee (we know Milt Vucinich will probably start), a
I speedy right half, Hugh Gallarneau, a tricky left half. Pete
I Kmetovic, and a spark-plug passing, punting, running quar-
I terback. Frank Albert.
Except for that quarterback spot, so it is with California.
The Allison system, however, doesn't make use of the quarter
| the way Shaughnessy does. Instead, the California quarter- j
i back, Bill Elmore, is a blocker—almost exclusively. But speedy
Jim Jurkovich at right half, tricky-travelling Orv Hatcher at
tailback and crashing Jafck McQuary at full parallel closely |
1 the Stanford ball-carrying corps.
STANFORD FAVOKEI)
If there's any advantage anywhere, it's indeeel hard to see.
1 On past record dope, any advantage would go to Stanford, but
; we've decided that such "dope" is just about worthless.
Well, there it is.
Psychology favors California: team strength, Stanford.

Stanford, in the backfield, has a plunging fullback. Norm
Standlee (we know Milt Vucinich will probably start), a
I speedy right half, Hugh Gallarneau, a tricky left half. Pete
I Kmetovic, and a spark-plug passing, punting, running quar-
I terback. Frank Albert.
Except for that quarterback spot, so it is with California.
The Allison system, however, doesn't make use of the quarter
| the way Shaughnessy does. Instead, the California quarter- j
i back, Bill Elmore, is a blocker—almost exclusively. But speedy
Jim Jurkovich at right half, tricky-travelling Orv Hatcher at
tailback and crashing Jafck McQuary at full parallel closely |
1 the Stanford ball-carrying corps.

Well, there it is.
Psychology favors California: team strength, Stanford.
You tell me who's going to win the Big Game.
Oh sure, I have a hunch—a hunch that points to California
as the ultimate victor. That surprising conclusion is reached
mainly on the basis of the peculiar psychology set up in the
mind of a team preceding each Big Game. Also, by deduc
tion is probably helped along by no little amount of prejudice.
Whoever wins, the coach of the team will really have a
record of which to boast. Whoever loses, the coach of that
team need not count the season as ruined.
Reams have been written in praise of the "miracles" that \
! Clark Shaughnessy has wrought down there at Stanford. My |
| adding to those tributes to Shaughnessy won't make much dif- !
I ference in his stack of clippings one way or the other, but at j
I least I'd like to go on record as reiterating everything laudatory 1
] that has been said about the job he has done.
But you know, with all the publicity drums beating out the j
! rhythm of Clark Shaughnessy's name, the work that. Stub
I Allison has been doing here at Berkeley has been noticed only
J too little.
ALLISON'S JOB
And it was and is a great piece of work. The Stubber took
a team, demoralized, down-hearted, trampled upon, beaten in
every sense of the word, and brought it up to a point where it
is considered one of the strongest—now second, perhaps, only 1
to Stanford (and we'll see about that!)—teams on the coast.
Perhaps Stub's record isn't as wonderful to behold on the
Pacific Coast Conference books as is that of Shaughnessy's,
but in the minds of every Californian who has seen this fighting I
?ang of Golden Bears overcome every kind of handicap pos- !
sible, I'll bet Stub's mark stands as high as does Clark's.
Stanford's in a position where they're tight as a drum j
head. They've got an unbeaten record to maintain. They're j
heavy favorites. They're going to the Bowl; they need a clean !
record for that.
SET FOR UPSET
Cailfornia is, inversely, in a remarkable position for an 1
upset. The Bears arc on their way up. They've had a taste of |
blood and they like it very much; they want more. They'll '
face the famous T formation they've heard so much about,
that's baffled every other opponent on the Coast. Yes, Cali
fornia is on a peak, ready to prove to the football world that
Stanford can be beaten, that the ignition to the Indians' Model T
can be short-circuited.
Now about the personnel of the two squads. The Cards are .
1 moulded into a smooth-functioning unit, with heavy emphasis
on the first string. So it is with California, and that smooth- j
| runing combination wasn't found until the U.S.C. game.
! CONDITION GOOD
With the possible exception of Big Chief Norm Standlee, 1
Stanford is in about the best condition of the year, especially ;
, since they've had a week in which to rest and prepare. So it
, is with California. For the first time this .season the roster of
, the Golden Bears is complete, all men present and accounted for.
On the line, the Cards have a very tough first string, with
i several men possible All-Coast selections, namely, Fred Meyer,
; Vic Lindskog, Bruno Banducci, and Chuck Taylor.
Similarly, California has some standouts in the forward wall.
Bob Reinhard, All-American candidate, is the outstanding man,
I but George Herrero, Chuck Donohoe, Harlen Gough, and Mot -
ley Mathewson may receive mention on more than one All-
Coast eleven.

on the first string. So it is with California, and that smooth- j
| runing combination wasn't found until the U.S.C. game.
! CONDITION GOOD
With the possible exception of Big Chief Norm Standlee, 1
Stanford is in about the best condition of the year, especially ;
, since they've had a week in which to rest and prepare. So it
, is with California. For the first time this .season the roster of
, the Golden Bears is complete, all men present and accounted for.
On the line, the Cards have a very tough first string, with
i several men possible All-Coast selections, namely, Fred Meyer,
; Vic Lindskog, Bruno Banducci, and Chuck Taylor.
Similarly, California has some standouts in the forward wall.
Bob Reinhard, All-American candidate, is the outstanding man,
I but George Herrero, Chuck Donohoe, Harlen Gough, and Mot -
ley Mathewson may receive mention on more than one All-
Coast eleven.
INDIAN BACKS
Stanford, in the backfield, has a plunging fullback. Norm
Standlee (we know Milt Vucinich will probably start), a
I speedy right half, Hugh Gallarneau, a tricky left half. Pete
I Kmetovic, and a spark-plug passing, punting, running quar-
I terback. Frank Albert.
Except for that quarterback spot, so it is with California.
The Allison system, however, doesn't make use of the quarter
| the way Shaughnessy does. Instead, the California quarter- j
i back, Bill Elmore, is a blocker—almost exclusively. But speedy
Jim Jurkovich at right half, tricky-travelling Orv Hatcher at
tailback and crashing Jafck McQuary at full parallel closely |
1 the Stanford ball-carrying corps.
STANFORD FAVOKEI)
If there's any advantage anywhere, it's indeeel hard to see.
1 On past record dope, any advantage would go to Stanford, but
; we've decided that such "dope" is just about worthless.
Well, there it is.
Psychology favors California: team strength, Stanford.
You tell me who's going to win the Big Game.
Oh sure, I have a hunch—a hunch that points to California
as the ultimate victor. That surprising conclusion is reached
mainly on the basis of the peculiar psychology set up in the
mind of a team preceding each Big Game. Also, by deduc
tion is probably helped along by no little amount of prejudice.
Whoever wins, the coach of the team will really have a
record of which to boast. Whoever loses, the coach of that
team need not count the season as ruined.
Reams have been written in praise of the "miracles" that \
! Clark Shaughnessy has wrought down there at Stanford. My |
| adding to those tributes to Shaughnessy won't make much dif- !
I ference in his stack of clippings one way or the other, but at j
I least I'd like to go on record as reiterating everything laudatory 1
] that has been said about the job he has done.
But you know, with all the publicity drums beating out the j
! rhythm of Clark Shaughnessy's name, the work that. Stub
I Allison has been doing here at Berkeley has been noticed only
J too little.
ALLISON'S JOB
And it was and is a great piece of work. The Stubber took
a team, demoralized, down-hearted, trampled upon, beaten in
every sense of the word, and brought it up to a point where it
is considered one of the strongest—now second, perhaps, only 1
to Stanford (and we'll see about that!)—teams on the coast.
Perhaps Stub's record isn't as wonderful to behold on the
Pacific Coast Conference books as is that of Shaughnessy's,
but in the minds of every Californian who has seen this fighting I
?ang of Golden Bears overcome every kind of handicap pos- !
sible, I'll bet Stub's mark stands as high as does Clark's.
Stanford's in a position where they're tight as a drum j
head. They've got an unbeaten record to maintain. They're j
heavy favorites. They're going to the Bowl; they need a clean !
record for that.
SET FOR UPSET
Cailfornia is, inversely, in a remarkable position for an 1
upset. The Bears arc on their way up. They've had a taste of |
blood and they like it very much; they want more. They'll '
face the famous T formation they've heard so much about,
that's baffled every other opponent on the Coast. Yes, Cali
fornia is on a peak, ready to prove to the football world that
Stanford can be beaten, that the ignition to the Indians' Model T
can be short-circuited.
