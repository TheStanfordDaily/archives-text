Tomorrow's Big Game will provide the climax to the success
story of five Stanford sophomore footballers. Bruno Banducci,
Dick Palmer, Ed Stamm. Chuck Taylor, and Milt Vucinich are
sure to have a lot, to do with a Stanford victory over Cal to
morrow.
These five played side by side through a highly successful
freshman season last year and this year have made good in a
big, varsity way. They have filled in the weak spots of last
year's team, not in a typically mediocre sophomore fashion,
but in a brilliant, constantly improving way which has played
a large part in Stanford's sensational football rise.
