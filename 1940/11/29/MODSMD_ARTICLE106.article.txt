# Cagers Tangle With Hamlin U. In Fall Quarter
## 
### 
Raising the curtain on the local
basketball season, Stanford's cagers
—the same boys who copped second
place in the conference last year—
take on Hamlin University's quintet
Monday night at 8 o'clock in the
Pavilion.
With a full team of lettermen to
work with. Coach Everett Dean will
probably field a team that will be
favored over the Hamlin outfit, al
though predictions this early in the
season are extremely unreliable. The
cagers from St. Paul, however, usu
ally have a good team, having been
state champions for the last nine
seasons.
Hamlin, coached by »jJoe Hut ton,
one of Dean's all-conference cagers
at Carleton College in 1923, will also
play several other bay region teams
during the course of their barn
storming tour.
BRIEF VACATION
After this game the Indians will
take a brief vacation from the courts
until finals are completed, coming
back on Dec. 17 to play the Olympic
Club in the Civic Auditorium in San
Francisco. Before they start the new
year with a home game against San
Diego State on Jan. 2, Dean's crew
will take on Indiana and Nebraska
on Jan. 21 and 27, respectively, in
San Francisco.
The first conference game will find
U.S.C.'s "Terrible" Trojans invading
the Farm for a pair of games on
Jan. 17 and 18.
Because of the fact that so many
lettermen have returned, Stanford's
starting line-up appears to be al
most set with Don Williams and
Fordy Anderson at forwards, Ken
Davidson and Bill Cowden at
guards. The center position, how
ever, is a different, story. Last season
Dick Taylor and Bob Penn handled
center duties, but this year Don Bur
ness, who had an operation on his
knee last year, has moved into the
competition for the starting center
berth.
BCRNKSS SMOOTH
Burn ess, who made his letter the
year l>efore last, is one of the
smoothest, cagers Stanford has had
since the days of Hank Luisetti, and
if his knee holds up he should give
the Indians added strength. All dur
ing practice this fall Burness has
been wearing a heavy bandage on
his knee and will probably continue
to do so all season.
Up from Coach Beeb Lee's all vic
torious frosh of last season are Jaek
Dana, Fred Linari, Fx! Voss, Leo Mc-
Caffrey, and John Eiklemati. Coach
Dean isn't counting too much on
these sophomores, however. He
says:
"It is very seldom that sophomores
are outstanding."
McCaffrey, a third-quarter frosh,
is not eligible for competition until
next quarter.
Rounding out the Indian squad
are Chuck Smith. Bob Wenzel, Tom
Fuller, Tiff Denton, and John All
tucker.

Rounding out the Indian squad
are Chuck Smith. Bob Wenzel, Tom
Fuller, Tiff Denton, and John All
tucker.
Raising the curtain on the local
basketball season, Stanford's cagers
—the same boys who copped second
place in the conference last year—
take on Hamlin University's quintet
Monday night at 8 o'clock in the
Pavilion.
With a full team of lettermen to
work with. Coach Everett Dean will
probably field a team that will be
favored over the Hamlin outfit, al
though predictions this early in the
season are extremely unreliable. The
cagers from St. Paul, however, usu
ally have a good team, having been
state champions for the last nine
seasons.
Hamlin, coached by »jJoe Hut ton,
one of Dean's all-conference cagers
at Carleton College in 1923, will also
play several other bay region teams
during the course of their barn
storming tour.
BRIEF VACATION
After this game the Indians will
take a brief vacation from the courts
until finals are completed, coming
back on Dec. 17 to play the Olympic
Club in the Civic Auditorium in San
Francisco. Before they start the new
year with a home game against San
Diego State on Jan. 2, Dean's crew
will take on Indiana and Nebraska
on Jan. 21 and 27, respectively, in
San Francisco.
The first conference game will find
U.S.C.'s "Terrible" Trojans invading
the Farm for a pair of games on
Jan. 17 and 18.
Because of the fact that so many
lettermen have returned, Stanford's
starting line-up appears to be al
most set with Don Williams and
Fordy Anderson at forwards, Ken
Davidson and Bill Cowden at
guards. The center position, how
ever, is a different, story. Last season
Dick Taylor and Bob Penn handled
center duties, but this year Don Bur
ness, who had an operation on his
knee last year, has moved into the
competition for the starting center
berth.
BCRNKSS SMOOTH
Burn ess, who made his letter the
year l>efore last, is one of the
smoothest, cagers Stanford has had
since the days of Hank Luisetti, and
if his knee holds up he should give
the Indians added strength. All dur
ing practice this fall Burness has
been wearing a heavy bandage on
his knee and will probably continue
to do so all season.
Up from Coach Beeb Lee's all vic
torious frosh of last season are Jaek
Dana, Fred Linari, Fx! Voss, Leo Mc-
Caffrey, and John Eiklemati. Coach
Dean isn't counting too much on
these sophomores, however. He
says:
"It is very seldom that sophomores
are outstanding."
McCaffrey, a third-quarter frosh,
is not eligible for competition until
next quarter.
