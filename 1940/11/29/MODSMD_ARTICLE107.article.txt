# Soccermen Battle Bears In Final Tilt
## 
### 
The Indian soccermen will lake J
he field for the last time tomorrow
do battle with the defensively
powerful California Bears. The
wil lget under way at 10:30
D'clock on the Califorina soccer
field.
In their meeting last Wednesday,!
he two teams battled to a 0-0 dead
ock, and both teams arc anxious for
â€¢evenge.
If the Indians take the contest,
they will gain second place in the
California Intercollegiate Soccer
Conference, but if they lose it will
throw things into a jumble.
The Indians have had a highly
successful season this year, going
through the year with only one con
ference defeat, that by San Jose,
and the tie with California. An
other encouraging note about this
year's team is that a great majority
of the squad are juniors and sopho
mores, and will be back next year
Tor heavy duty. Among the most
promising of these are Fernando
Eleta, A 1 Wool, Louis Arismendi,
Ray Chapot, Joe McHarg, and Tony
i Guntherman.
SAME SQUAD STARTS
Coach Maloney said that he ;
j would .start the same line-up for to- !
morrow's game that he started last
j Wednesday. At goalie will be the
defensively sensational Jack Burns.
The two fullbacks will be Ned Pugh
and Dick Harmon.
At the halfback posts wiil be
Wilson Clark, Gordy Nicoll and I
; sophomore Ray Chapot. Outside
right goes to George La Nicca and
' inside right to George Dole. The
three forwards will be Franny Mor
gan, Joe McHarg and Tony Gun
j therman.
Cal was in the underdog role j
when they held the Cards to a draw |
on the Stanford field. Tomorrow the |
Maloneymen will not underrate their
opponents, figure to be a lot harder ;
| to heat.
Principal Stanford offensive threat
comes from forwards George La- j
Nicca find George Dole. In Pugh,
Harmon and Burns the Farm team '
has potentially the % strongest de- !
fense trio in the league. The only
| time the defense really faltered was
I when the Cards dropped that 4-1 de
eision to the Spartans.
<;i:t few workouts
The Cards have been hampered
this season, strangely enough, by the
large size of the squad. This neees- j
sitated splitting the team into two
groups, one to practice three days
a work, the other to work two days. !
Coach Maloney has been working
hard to improve the Stanford at- '
; tack this week. The scoring punch
was present in the early game of
the season, but after the hooters had
won live straight an unaccountable
1 slump hit the team and perform
ances fell off considerably.
The blame for this cannot be laid
to injuries, as the eleven has re- \
semhfed the football team in being
remarkably free from serious in
juries.
