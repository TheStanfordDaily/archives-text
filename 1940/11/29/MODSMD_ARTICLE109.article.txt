# Bowl-Bound Stanford Indians Ready to Bring Axe Back to the Farm
## Unmarred Season at Stake As Cards March to Berkeley; Standlee to Flay at Fullback 
### JERRY BRUCKER Sports Editor, The Stanford Daily 
Bent on achieving the first Stanford gridiron vic
tory over California since 1935, Clark Shaughnessy's
undefeated and untied Indians will do battle with the
vastly improved Golden Bears on the turf of Berke
ley's Memorial Stadium tomorrow afternoon.
Seventy-five thousand fans and rooters, a capacity
crowd, will jam the stands to witness the forty-sixth
clash between the Cardinal and the Blue and Gold,
the forty-sixth Big Game.

► Iwo awards hang on the outcome of tomorrow's
jame. First and most important is the Stanford Axe,
rvhich has been in the possession of California since
1936. In 1933 Stanford put up the Axe as a trophy
to go to the winner of the annual Big Game. It re
named on the Farm until the Beara swamped Stan
ord, 20-0, the year after the graduation of the Vow
ng Sophs.
Tomorrow, if the Indians win, the historic chopper
vill return to its case in the Union.
The second honor that Stanford will be shooting
'or Ls undisputed possession of the Pacific Coast Con
ference title and a clear right to the Pasadena Rose
Bowl bid. A victory would do the trick, a loss would
irop the Indians to a tie with Washington for the
crown.
TEAMS READY
Reports from the rival camps indicate that, with
one possible exception, both squads will be at full
strength when the whistle blows at 2 o'clock to
morrow.
That exception is Stanford's crashing fuLlback,
I senior Norm Standlee. Injured in the first quarter of
; the Washington game three weeks ago, Standlee made
practice for the first time Tuesday. His bad ankle
made him miss 13 days of practice, which may impair
his effectiveness even if he is able to start the game.
But whether he is on the bench or on the field, the
Chief will be acting captain for Stanford tomorrow.
Tliis honor comes as a reward for his three years of
great football on Stanford teams, good and bad.
MEYER RECOVERED
All other members of the two squads have, how
ever, fully recovered from injuries received during
the season. Freddy Meyer and Clem Tomerlin, Stan
ford flankmen, have fully recovered from injuries they
came up with after the Oregon State game.
Ted Staffler, George Herero, Morley Mathewson,
Bear linemen, suffering from injuries earlier in the
week, have been labeled O.K. for action by the med
icos. Jim Jurkovich, sophomore backfield star, was
removed from the Oregon game two weeks ago be
cause of a crack on the head, but is now back in top
shape.
If Standlee is fit. to start, Clark Shaughnessy will
field, for his first Big Game, the same eleven men who
! opened in the Washington.
j VOOSH MAY START
If Norm is unable to play, or is held on the bench
until a crucial point in the game, sophomore Milt
Vucinich will get. the call. Rod Parker will be on
hand to take over if big Milt hogs down.
Both Parker and Vucinich showed flashes of of
fensive brilliance against the Beavers, but neither
| can match Standee's hard tackling and heads-up pass
protection on defense.
If Vucinich is nominated on the starting eleven,
six men playing their first year of varsity football
for the Cardinal will be in the line-up, five of them
sophomores.
TWO SOPHS
Only two first -year men will start for the Bears,
j (renter Fom Mason and l ight halfback Jim Jurkoviclv.
Tomorrows meeting will find Slanford favored to
win for the first time since their last victory in 193, r ».
Current betting odds favor the Indians about 3-1. It's
! also the first time since that, date that Stanford has
come up to the Big Game with a better won-and-lost
record than their Bear rivals.
In spite of their mediocre record this fall, however,
. the Boars boast of one of the strongest lines defen
sively on the Coast. In Boh Reinhard, Chuck Dono
hoe, and George Hercrro they have three top-flight.
! linemen.
INDIAN PASSES %
California has yet to show, however, a passing at
lack that can measure up to the aerial offensive of
tho Indian squad, featured by the southpaw sling
ing of quarterback Frankie Albert. The Bears have
also been spotty at. times on pass defense.
The Stanford line has been very effective in stop
piny ground attacks this year. Only two touchdown.,
have boon scored through this forward wall all sea
son. and one of those war, a plunge by U.S.C.'s Jack
Banta after a pass interference penalty placed the
ball on the one-yard line.
KICKERS MEET
A punting duel between two of the nation's best
kickers may feature the game. Bob Reinhard, big
tackle, has done most of the Bear punting this year,
and has done it extremely well. Frankie Albert, taking
his first serious crack at the kicking chores for Stan
ford in the Oregon State game, averaged over 50 yards
per boot.
The Stanford warriors will leave the campus to
night and stay at Rancho Hacienda until kickoff time
tomorrow. Tho California squad will also assume an
off-campus address for tonight, but Stub Allison did
not disclose just where the Bears will hibernate.
Coaches of both teams appeared satisfied that their
charges were primed for their best effort of the year.
Stanford's squad has regained the high peak in spirit
and timing that they have maintained all year.

per boot.
The Stanford warriors will leave the campus to
night and stay at Rancho Hacienda until kickoff time
tomorrow. Tho California squad will also assume an
off-campus address for tonight, but Stub Allison did
not disclose just where the Bears will hibernate.
Coaches of both teams appeared satisfied that their
charges were primed for their best effort of the year.
Stanford's squad has regained the high peak in spirit
and timing that they have maintained all year.
Bent on achieving the first Stanford gridiron vic
tory over California since 1935, Clark Shaughnessy's
undefeated and untied Indians will do battle with the
vastly improved Golden Bears on the turf of Berke
ley's Memorial Stadium tomorrow afternoon.
Seventy-five thousand fans and rooters, a capacity
crowd, will jam the stands to witness the forty-sixth
clash between the Cardinal and the Blue and Gold,
the forty-sixth Big Game.

► Iwo awards hang on the outcome of tomorrow's
jame. First and most important is the Stanford Axe,
rvhich has been in the possession of California since
1936. In 1933 Stanford put up the Axe as a trophy
to go to the winner of the annual Big Game. It re
named on the Farm until the Beara swamped Stan
ord, 20-0, the year after the graduation of the Vow
ng Sophs.
Tomorrow, if the Indians win, the historic chopper
vill return to its case in the Union.
The second honor that Stanford will be shooting
'or Ls undisputed possession of the Pacific Coast Con
ference title and a clear right to the Pasadena Rose
Bowl bid. A victory would do the trick, a loss would
irop the Indians to a tie with Washington for the
crown.
TEAMS READY
Reports from the rival camps indicate that, with
one possible exception, both squads will be at full
strength when the whistle blows at 2 o'clock to
morrow.
That exception is Stanford's crashing fuLlback,
I senior Norm Standlee. Injured in the first quarter of
; the Washington game three weeks ago, Standlee made
practice for the first time Tuesday. His bad ankle
made him miss 13 days of practice, which may impair
his effectiveness even if he is able to start the game.
But whether he is on the bench or on the field, the
Chief will be acting captain for Stanford tomorrow.
Tliis honor comes as a reward for his three years of
great football on Stanford teams, good and bad.
MEYER RECOVERED
All other members of the two squads have, how
ever, fully recovered from injuries received during
the season. Freddy Meyer and Clem Tomerlin, Stan
ford flankmen, have fully recovered from injuries they
came up with after the Oregon State game.
Ted Staffler, George Herero, Morley Mathewson,
Bear linemen, suffering from injuries earlier in the
week, have been labeled O.K. for action by the med
icos. Jim Jurkovich, sophomore backfield star, was
removed from the Oregon game two weeks ago be
cause of a crack on the head, but is now back in top
shape.
If Standlee is fit. to start, Clark Shaughnessy will
field, for his first Big Game, the same eleven men who
! opened in the Washington.
j VOOSH MAY START
If Norm is unable to play, or is held on the bench
until a crucial point in the game, sophomore Milt
Vucinich will get. the call. Rod Parker will be on
hand to take over if big Milt hogs down.
Both Parker and Vucinich showed flashes of of
fensive brilliance against the Beavers, but neither
| can match Standee's hard tackling and heads-up pass
protection on defense.
If Vucinich is nominated on the starting eleven,
six men playing their first year of varsity football
for the Cardinal will be in the line-up, five of them
sophomores.
TWO SOPHS
Only two first -year men will start for the Bears,
j (renter Fom Mason and l ight halfback Jim Jurkoviclv.

win for the first time since their last victory in 193, r ».
Current betting odds favor the Indians about 3-1. It's

come up to the Big Game with a better won-and-lost
record than their Bear rivals.

California has yet to show, however, a passing at
lack that can measure up to the aerial offensive of
tho Indian squad, featured by the southpaw sling

also been spotty at. times on pass defense.
The Stanford line has been very effective in stop
piny ground attacks this year. Only two touchdown.,
have boon scored through this forward wall all sea

Banta after a pass interference penalty placed the
ball on the one-yard line.

A punting duel between two of the nation's best
kickers may feature the game. Bob Reinhard, big

and has done it extremely well. Frankie Albert, taking

A punting duel between two of the nation's best
kickers may feature the game. Bob Reinhard, big
tackle, has done most of the Bear punting this year,
and has done it extremely well. Frankie Albert, taking
his first serious crack at the kicking chores for Stan
ford in the Oregon State game, averaged over 50 yards
per boot.
The Stanford warriors will leave the campus to
night and stay at Rancho Hacienda until kickoff time
tomorrow. Tho California squad will also assume an
off-campus address for tonight, but Stub Allison did
not disclose just where the Bears will hibernate.
Coaches of both teams appeared satisfied that their
charges were primed for their best effort of the year.
Stanford's squad has regained the high peak in spirit
and timing that they have maintained all year.
Bent on achieving the first Stanford gridiron vic
tory over California since 1935, Clark Shaughnessy's
undefeated and untied Indians will do battle with the
vastly improved Golden Bears on the turf of Berke
ley's Memorial Stadium tomorrow afternoon.
Seventy-five thousand fans and rooters, a capacity
crowd, will jam the stands to witness the forty-sixth
clash between the Cardinal and the Blue and Gold,
the forty-sixth Big Game.

► Iwo awards hang on the outcome of tomorrow's
jame. First and most important is the Stanford Axe,
rvhich has been in the possession of California since
1936. In 1933 Stanford put up the Axe as a trophy
to go to the winner of the annual Big Game. It re
named on the Farm until the Beara swamped Stan
ord, 20-0, the year after the graduation of the Vow
ng Sophs.
Tomorrow, if the Indians win, the historic chopper
vill return to its case in the Union.
The second honor that Stanford will be shooting
'or Ls undisputed possession of the Pacific Coast Con
ference title and a clear right to the Pasadena Rose
Bowl bid. A victory would do the trick, a loss would
irop the Indians to a tie with Washington for the
crown.
TEAMS READY
Reports from the rival camps indicate that, with
one possible exception, both squads will be at full
strength when the whistle blows at 2 o'clock to
morrow.
That exception is Stanford's crashing fuLlback,
I senior Norm Standlee. Injured in the first quarter of
; the Washington game three weeks ago, Standlee made
practice for the first time Tuesday. His bad ankle
made him miss 13 days of practice, which may impair
his effectiveness even if he is able to start the game.
But whether he is on the bench or on the field, the
Chief will be acting captain for Stanford tomorrow.
Tliis honor comes as a reward for his three years of
great football on Stanford teams, good and bad.
MEYER RECOVERED
All other members of the two squads have, how
ever, fully recovered from injuries received during
the season. Freddy Meyer and Clem Tomerlin, Stan
ford flankmen, have fully recovered from injuries they
came up with after the Oregon State game.
Ted Staffler, George Herero, Morley Mathewson,
Bear linemen, suffering from injuries earlier in the
week, have been labeled O.K. for action by the med
icos. Jim Jurkovich, sophomore backfield star, was
removed from the Oregon game two weeks ago be
cause of a crack on the head, but is now back in top
shape.
If Standlee is fit. to start, Clark Shaughnessy will
field, for his first Big Game, the same eleven men who
! opened in the Washington.
j VOOSH MAY START
If Norm is unable to play, or is held on the bench
until a crucial point in the game, sophomore Milt
Vucinich will get. the call. Rod Parker will be on
hand to take over if big Milt hogs down.
Both Parker and Vucinich showed flashes of of
fensive brilliance against the Beavers, but neither
| can match Standee's hard tackling and heads-up pass
protection on defense.
If Vucinich is nominated on the starting eleven,
six men playing their first year of varsity football
for the Cardinal will be in the line-up, five of them
sophomores.
TWO SOPHS
Only two first -year men will start for the Bears,
j (renter Fom Mason and l ight halfback Jim Jurkoviclv.
Tomorrows meeting will find Slanford favored to
win for the first time since their last victory in 193, r ».
Current betting odds favor the Indians about 3-1. It's
! also the first time since that, date that Stanford has
come up to the Big Game with a better won-and-lost
record than their Bear rivals.
In spite of their mediocre record this fall, however,

California has yet to show, however, a passing at
lack that can measure up to the aerial offensive of
tho Indian squad, featured by the southpaw sling

also been spotty at. times on pass defense.
The Stanford line has been very effective in stop
piny ground attacks this year. Only two touchdown.,
