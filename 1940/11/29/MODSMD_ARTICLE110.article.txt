||UMANIA'S pro-Nazi Iron
Guardists two days ago exe
cuted G4 followers of former King
Carol. Yesterday new killings were
reported, and the picture took on
the aspects of civil war.
It was the tone of yesterday's dis
patches from Bucharest that re
veals the terrorism that Rumania
is knowing these days at the hands
of llu? Iron Guardists.
Two university professors, Nicho
las lorga and Vergil Madgearu,
were among those found shot to
death near the capital. Both wei'e
former cabinet members.
Quotations from the United Press
dispatches disclose more of the
murdered men:
"Madgearu was a political figure
of importance. He was minister of
finance and of commerce in several
Feasant Party governments. He was
professor of commercial science at
the ITigh Academy and author of
works on economics
'It was learned thai Iron Guuid
is Is abducted lorga front his home.
1 io was furmei premier, minister of
education, and a member of ex-
King Carol's Royal Council. He was
also Carol's private tutor. He was
considered the world's greatest au
thority on Byzantine art."
These are two victims of Nazi
tactics in Rumania. It was similar
terror and brutality that made
the Nazi regime secure in Ger
many in 19:54 by the now-famous
Blood Purge.

the past week, British states
men have described the pre
t arious position in which British
hipping finds itself. Buried among
these distressing appeals was a
comment by Leslie Hore-Belisha
! hat perhaps deserves more atten
on than it received.
Hore-Belisha said that Britain
could not count upon the United
States to replace her shipping
losses but must take the initiative
herself and knock Italy out of
the war.
Dispatches from both London and
ithens during the past weeks in
lieate that the British decided upon
his course some time ago. Every
Iritish action in the Mediterranean
ins been aimed at forcing Italy
nto a major engagement. Con
tantly, she has sent air squadrons
ver strategic Italian bases, and on
everal occasions it appears that the
hiti.sh fleet tried to draw the Fas
cist navy into battle.
More recently, Britain has sent
an expeditionary force to Greece,
which at present quite possibly is
giving the Greeks more aid than
is generally admitted.
Dispatches yesterday told of new
Greek advances and also of a Brit
ish victory over the Italian fleet in
the Mediterranean. Whether there
i: great significance to either of
these actions is questionable, but
the fact remains clearly that the
British are set upon knocking Italy
out of the war.
