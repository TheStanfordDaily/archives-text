BRIDE ROMPS
Let it be; known now that the j
Smetana opus is a lighi comic opera.
It was produced during the spring I
light opera season at the Met, where j
it was a great success. It is gen- j
erally known as a romping Czecho- j
slovakian folk-opera, according to
F. Cowles Strickland, director of '
dramatics in the division.
"The Bartered Bride," which will j
be produced in conjunction with the
music department, revolves around
the story of a young girl, Marie, j
whose parents have arranged with
a marriage broker to marry her off J
to a shy, bashful, stuttering boy.
Complications arise when it is !
known that she loves an other. Dur- j
ing the unwinding of the plot, a
circus hires the shy boy to play the [
part of a bear in a ballet. A circus j
ballet, complete with slapstick, is .
not grand opera.
