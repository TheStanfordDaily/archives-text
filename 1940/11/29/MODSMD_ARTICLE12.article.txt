# Big Game Spirit Climbs With Traditional Pyre; S.A.E. Cops Float Prize
## 
### JEAN NOWELL HAROLD SHAFER 
A howling, hilarious mob of Stanfordites
lined Lasuen from the Fiji house to the En
gineering corner last night, as the Big Game
Parade, half a hundred floats long, wended its
torch-lit way down the Row toward the Pa
vilion.

Ranging from the magnificent to i
the very risque in treatment, the
floats were unanimous in their basic
themes—Shaughnessy and the foot
ball team are wonderful; kill Cal;
the Rose Bowl is a fine thing when
you're going to be in it.
From the judges' stand on the
Post Office steps, Drs. Margery Bai
ley, Philip Buck, and Robert Ross
observed the proceedings, dodged
Madrono's shower of nuts and the
Sigma Chi's water-bags, and finally
decided that Sigma Alpha Epsilon's
senior entry was worthy of the
sweepstakes prize, the Roos Broth
| ers' loving cup.
ROSE-COVERED FLOAT
The loving-cup winner was a huge
Indian and a dead bear on a float
covered completely with roses. Fi
' nal touch to the Pasadena-type cre
| ation was a "queen" in the strict
i Tournament of Roses sense.
El Campo walked off with the
Best Men's award, a football from
Smith's, with its diatribe against,
the B.A.C. The float depicted a
man confined in the stocks for
lending his student body card.
The white-robed nut-throwing |
women from Madrono were judged i
best in ihe women's division. They
will win a picture from the Camera J
Shop. The Keeble award, also a j
picture, went to Chi Psi for the
most original entry. This was the
signing of a non-aggression pact
with John MacPherson as Stalin and
Bruce Jessup as Hitler. Second prize
in this division went to Alpa Kappa
Lambda for their bear with the rosy
light bulb in the seat of his pants,
iA. O. PI'S WIN
"Referee's Time Out," entered by
! Alpha Omicron Pi, copped the Most
j Humorous entry award; El Toro's
I Indian camp with symbols of vic
| tory hung out to dry, a tepee, a
Queen — strictly home-grown — and
a Redskin beating a drum won
Zwerlein's cup for the entry most I
symbolic of the Big Game.
Toro also won first place in the
Mon's Hall division with El Campo
taking second place, and El Capitan's
oil-well Campanile third.
In the Women's Hall division, Ma
drorio was awarded first prize, tho 1
"Life at Roble" float was second,
and Klahoya's "Beating the Bear" 1
! entry was third.
"S.A.E., Jr.," depicting two cows I
j illustrative of "the ol' squeeze play" j
' and "it's in the bag," took first place
in the Fraternity division. Second !
was D.U.'s "Shag's Pluto Water" 1
and third was Phi Kappa Sigma's ;
steam-roller.
First in the Sorority division was I
the A. O. Pi float. "Our Team Is
Red-Hot," entered by Kappa Kappa
i Gamma, was second, and Gamma
Phi Beta's picture of the kowtow
! ing bears was awarded third place.
.

Stanford gutted the coffin of the lowly
Golden Bear last night.
To the tune of the Farm's own rolling
"Give 'Em the Axe," 5,000 members of the
Stanford family sang a dirge for Saturday's
opponent around a blazing funeral pyre that

►many believed was the highest and
the chubbiest in Big Game history.
Throwing itself higher and high
er into the heavens, last night's fire
marked (he return of Stanford's most
colorful of her many sacred tradi
tions to its foimer site in LagunUu
lake bed.
Since 6 o'clock yesterday morn
ing spirited Encinamen had been
piling 10,000 beer boxes and as
sorted conglomerate of every de
j scription onto the giant pile.
ENCINA GUARD
From the moment the last brick
bat had been hurled at the massive
Bonfire until oil was .sprayed around
its base and Freshman President Jim
Ellis lighted the fuse that sent En
ema's pride roaring and kicking
into the sky, careful guard had been
kept against a Cal invasion.
An entire ring of Encinamen gir
dled the fire, and proud was the man
who swung a $5 lath-turned and
polished hickory banister.
But Cal didn't turn up, and the
old grizzly began to broil following
Walt Heinecke's Shell fireworks and
Sequoia's affixing of the coffin to
Stanford's Fiftieth Year Big Game
Bonfire.
GREAT SPIRIT
Bob Breckner, Bonfire chairman,
■ lauded the hard-working men of '44
who erected the 60-foot pile thus:
"The size of the Bonfire evidences
the tremendous enthusiasm and hard
| work of th frosh."
During the day, specially chosen
! Roble women served breakfast and
I lunch to their slaving he-men.

marked (he return of Stanford's most

Since 6 o'clock yesterday morn
ing spirited Encinamen had been
piling 10,000 beer boxes and as
sorted conglomerate of every de

ENCINA GUARD
From the moment the last brick
bat had been hurled at the massive
Bonfire until oil was .sprayed around
its base and Freshman President Jim
Ellis lighted the fuse that sent En
ema's pride roaring and kicking
into the sky, careful guard had been
kept against a Cal invasion.
An entire ring of Encinamen gir
dled the fire, and proud was the man
who swung a $5 lath-turned and
polished hickory banister.
But Cal didn't turn up, and the
old grizzly began to broil following
Walt Heinecke's Shell fireworks and
Sequoia's affixing of the coffin to
Stanford's Fiftieth Year Big Game
Bonfire.
GREAT SPIRIT
Bob Breckner, Bonfire chairman,
■ lauded the hard-working men of '44
who erected the 60-foot pile thus:
"The size of the Bonfire evidences
the tremendous enthusiasm and hard
| work of th frosh."
During the day, specially chosen
! Roble women served breakfast and
I lunch to their slaving he-men.
A howling, hilarious mob of Stanfordites
lined Lasuen from the Fiji house to the En
gineering corner last night, as the Big Game
Parade, half a hundred floats long, wended its
torch-lit way down the Row toward the Pa
vilion.

Ranging from the magnificent to i
the very risque in treatment, the
floats were unanimous in their basic
themes—Shaughnessy and the foot
ball team are wonderful; kill Cal;
the Rose Bowl is a fine thing when
you're going to be in it.
From the judges' stand on the

Stanford gutted the coffin of the lowly
Golden Bear last night.
To the tune of the Farm's own rolling
"Give 'Em the Axe," 5,000 members of the
Stanford family sang a dirge for Saturday's
opponent around a blazing funeral pyre that

►many believed was the highest and
the chubbiest in Big Game history.
Throwing itself higher and high
er into the heavens, last night's fire
marked (he return of Stanford's most
colorful of her many sacred tradi
tions to its foimer site in LagunUu
lake bed.
Since 6 o'clock yesterday morn
ing spirited Encinamen had been
piling 10,000 beer boxes and as
sorted conglomerate of every de
j scription onto the giant pile.
ENCINA GUARD
From the moment the last brick
bat had been hurled at the massive
Bonfire until oil was .sprayed around
its base and Freshman President Jim
Ellis lighted the fuse that sent En
ema's pride roaring and kicking
into the sky, careful guard had been
kept against a Cal invasion.
An entire ring of Encinamen gir
dled the fire, and proud was the man
who swung a $5 lath-turned and
polished hickory banister.
But Cal didn't turn up, and the
old grizzly began to broil following
Walt Heinecke's Shell fireworks and
Sequoia's affixing of the coffin to
Stanford's Fiftieth Year Big Game
Bonfire.
GREAT SPIRIT
Bob Breckner, Bonfire chairman,
■ lauded the hard-working men of '44
who erected the 60-foot pile thus:
"The size of the Bonfire evidences
the tremendous enthusiasm and hard
| work of th frosh."
During the day, specially chosen
! Roble women served breakfast and
I lunch to their slaving he-men.
A howling, hilarious mob of Stanfordites
lined Lasuen from the Fiji house to the En
gineering corner last night, as the Big Game
Parade, half a hundred floats long, wended its
torch-lit way down the Row toward the Pa
vilion.

Ranging from the magnificent to i
the very risque in treatment, the
floats were unanimous in their basic
themes—Shaughnessy and the foot
ball team are wonderful; kill Cal;
the Rose Bowl is a fine thing when
you're going to be in it.
From the judges' stand on the
Post Office steps, Drs. Margery Bai
ley, Philip Buck, and Robert Ross
observed the proceedings, dodged
Madrono's shower of nuts and the
Sigma Chi's water-bags, and finally
decided that Sigma Alpha Epsilon's
senior entry was worthy of the
sweepstakes prize, the Roos Broth
| ers' loving cup.
ROSE-COVERED FLOAT
The loving-cup winner was a huge
Indian and a dead bear on a float
covered completely with roses. Fi
' nal touch to the Pasadena-type cre
| ation was a "queen" in the strict
i Tournament of Roses sense.
El Campo walked off with the
Best Men's award, a football from
Smith's, with its diatribe against,
the B.A.C. The float depicted a
man confined in the stocks for
lending his student body card.
The white-robed nut-throwing |
women from Madrono were judged i
best in ihe women's division. They
will win a picture from the Camera J
Shop. The Keeble award, also a j
picture, went to Chi Psi for the
most original entry. This was the
signing of a non-aggression pact
with John MacPherson as Stalin and
Bruce Jessup as Hitler. Second prize
in this division went to Alpa Kappa
Lambda for their bear with the rosy
light bulb in the seat of his pants,
iA. O. PI'S WIN
"Referee's Time Out," entered by
! Alpha Omicron Pi, copped the Most
j Humorous entry award; El Toro's
I Indian camp with symbols of vic
| tory hung out to dry, a tepee, a
Queen — strictly home-grown — and
a Redskin beating a drum won
Zwerlein's cup for the entry most I
symbolic of the Big Game.
