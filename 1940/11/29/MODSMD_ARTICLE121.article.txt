leadet. Clark Shaughnessy. He has given to us all an example which we
can he proud to emulate."
Dean Bunn went on to say that throughout the whole of this season,
which is unparalleled in Stanford athletic history. Mr. Shaughncssy

has always demonstrated the finest
sportsmanship in his relations with
opponents, officials, the press and
the public.
Mi. Bunn stressed the fact that
above all Coach Shaughnessy "has
never failed to remember that he
represents Stanford," and that he
has placed the welfare of his boys
first in all cases.
"If we all—students, faculty, yell
leaders, players, revelers—do our
part as well, then we shall be able
to look back on this 1940 Big Game
with a sense of satisfaction in a job
well done and with the assurance
that we have been welcome guests."
