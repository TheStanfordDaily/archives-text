## 
### 
"(Jet to the Big Game early! We can't stress that too much," was the
gist of the official statement released last night by Itally Committee Chair
men Bill Kimball and Pat Smith.
"According to B.A.C. statistics. 3,092 rooters' tickets have been sold to
Stanford students, and it's going to be a tight squeeze to get them all in.

Rally Committee will have to
low the policy of 'first come first
served' in filling the rooting section."
The Stanford rooting section will
occupy section G on the west
(shady) side of Berkeley stadium,
students entering through gates FF
and G. The kickoff is scheduled for I
2 o'eiock.

Requirements for admission to the
rooting section are the same as have
been enforced all during the season
—white shirts or blouses, and root
ers' hats or pompons. All gii-ls who
have victory feathers are requested
to wear them, according to the
chairmen.
For the first time in Farm histox'y,
women as well as men will partici
pate in half-time card stunts. The
entire stunt section contains 2,200
students.
Kally Committee has prepared 12
separate stunts, some of them com
posed of several parts. The huge
section allowed the artists much
more freedom than they have had in
the past, according to Kimball, and
the stunts are expected to be among
the most effective ever performed by
Stanford.
MOVING STUNT '
Biggest innovation is a moving
stunt—a large Stanford Indian wav
ing his hand in greeting to the Cal
rooters. Another is an exact copy of
the windshield sticker now being
used on the Berkeley campus which
shows a long, lanky bear chasing a
freightened little Indian with the
Axe. In the Farm version, of course,
the position are reversed.
Other stunts feature the Cal bear
behind a huge black eight-ball,
Stanford's own red racer of Daily
fame, the WOW boys of 1940, Coach
Clark Shaughnessy, and the Farm's
fiftieth anniversary celebration.
Last stunt is a huge American eagle
with the United States shield on his
breast.
Before the kickoff the band will
present a special marching stunt in
honor of the Bears. The Cal band
takes over the field during half
time.
