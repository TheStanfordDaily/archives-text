SAN FRANCISCO. Nov. 28 (UP).
â€”Golden Gate bridge authorities to
day rejected a proposal to screen the
sidewalks of the bridge for the pur
pose of preventing suicides.
Bridge Manager William Harrel
son told the board of directors that
the screens would increase wind re
sistance. Engineer Russell Cone sent
word from Tacoma that he opposed
the screens because they would be
unsightly and would interfere with
maintenance.
"Even if we place screens along
the bridge itself, there still would be
many places along the approaches
from which despondent persons
might leap," Harrelson said.
