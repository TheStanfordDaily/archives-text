# Cal Confidence Cools as Card Chances Loom High and Wide
## 
### 
California's confidence is waning fast, and with it goes much of Berke
ley's Big Game lighting spirit.
Last week a member of the Cal student body wrote to Stanford concern
ing the Texas A and IVI versus Stanford question. He ended his vitriolic
letter by saying. "What's the matter —afraid to take a licking?"

"Oh well—consider the source, i
maybe you'll have the wind taken
out of your sails after Cal beats the |
tar out of the poor lil* Indian No- |
vember 3Uth.
"Learn to take success without
getting so blastedly big headed. And
above all try being good losers—
just for a change."
Such was the expression of the
growing Big Game spirit last week.
But this week, Cal men are blowing
out the other side of their strained
faces.
Last night a Stanford man ofTered
a Cal student three to one odds and
14 points on tomorrow's game. The
Cal man refused—an expression of
weakening Cal spirit.
Down on the Farm, Stanfordites
climaxed a week of feverish activi
ties with a best-ever parade, a bon
fire, and a pledge to bring back the
axe.
Outward expressions, which
brought the administrative wrath of
Stanford and California officials,
simmered through the week and

j of raids by both student bodies.
Last Sunday night a Cal raiding
I party looting one of the Farm fra
ternities. At the same time retaliat
ing Stanfordites painted the C. From
that point overt spirit, of a rugged
type, sprayed both campuses, as
raiders see-sawed back and foi-th,
burning C's on Farm lawns, paint
ing S's on California sidewalks.
Tomorrow that Big Game spirit
will push Stanford to victory and
the Axe into Stanford's display case.
