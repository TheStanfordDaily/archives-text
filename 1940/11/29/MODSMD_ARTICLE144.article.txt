# Battle for 'The Axe' Rages For 41 Years
## Huge Weapon Symbolizes Bitter Card-Bear Rivalry 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Strangest thing about the Stanford Axe is that, while it is the greatest
symbol of the Cal-Stanford rivalry, it, in itself, did more than any other
thing to create that rivalry; and the events surrounding its origin and
checkered history are credited by some authorities with having crystallized
both the Stanford and University of California spirits. .?
It all began back in '9l when Stanford first opened its gates. The
Berkeley Behemoth was settled in its ways with a good 30 years of

tradition under its belt. It had had,
no rivals for three decades, and
when the Palo Altans moved in
down on the Peninsula, it was only
natural that Cal should look down
her regal nose at the upstarts. Also
it was only natural that the Stan
fords should be the cocky little
fellows, resentful of their rivals'
superior attitude.
Events rolled along nicely until.
1899. Stanford had dropped only
one of- the Cal-Stanford baseball
series, even winning the very first
game, played in 1892. It had also
won thq first football game played
the same year, at the Haight Street
Grounds in San Francisco. Serpen
tine was used for the first time then
to decorate the San Francisco -
bound student trains. Cal was be
ginning to realize that the battle
for athletic supremacy was on.
YELL INTRODUCED
BY IRWIN IN '96
In 1896, Will Irwin, together with
Chris Bradley, had introduced the
Axe Yell. It could not have been
equaled as an expression of the
sentiment Stanford held for U.C.
All the bloody associations con
nected with axes touched the kin
dred feeling Stanford held for its
still superior rival.
Then in 1899 a black tragedy
hit the Farm. George Beckett,
captain of the baseball team and
star pitcher, died before the sea
son started. He couldn't be re
placed arid Stanford lost the first
game of the series. It looked as
though the "any-Stanford-man
is - worth two - Cal -men - any - time -
any-place" theory was in for a
nasty set-back.
Desperately the students sought a
way to rebuild team spirit. Out of
this search came the first Big Game
Bonfire and The Axe. At the bon
fire Frank English and Billy Erb,
yell leader in his off-season from
football, produced a huge ten-pound
axe and before a cheering throng
sharpened it to a razor edge. Then,
with the crowd at a fever pitch, they
cut off the head of a blue and gold
effigy with one blow.
ROOTERS TAKE AXE
TO BASEBALL GAME
The great red axe went with the
rooters to the baseball game in San
Francisco, and it was constantly in
evidence. But Stanford lost the
gahie and the series 9-7. Strangely,
it was Cal's place to make the Axe
a 33-year bone of contention. Some
University of California men hadn't
liked that axe and they determined
to take down the Stanford come
uppance a little by stealing it.
Meanwhile the despondent Billy
Erb had given the axe to Carl Hay
den (Hayden grew up to be a U.S.
Senator, but he was only a de
bater then), and he and two com
panions started off dragging the axe
behind them. Tom Mcfadden, 200-
pound Stanford tackle, heard some
Cal men planning the theft. Imme
diately the axe regained some of
its prestige, if only that it gave him
a chance to battle a few Berkeley
ites. He joined the other three and
they started warily off down the
street.
BERKELEY HORDE
FOLLOWS DEFENDERS
A growing horde of Cal men fol
lowed them. The four defenders
took a four-man grip on the prize,
and waited. Then began a fight
which raged over San Francisco for
six or seven hours. At first the melee
was general, then gradually four
radiating lines formed, each man
with his arms locked around the
man in front of him, and the four
Stanford men at the nucleus grim
ly hanging on to their axe.
It was natui-al that their grips
should evetnually break, but Mc-
Fadden managed to last the long
est. Among the Berkeleyites was a
football player, Paul Castlehun. He
is now Dr. Castlehun of San Fran
cisco. In an interview yesterday
he said:
"I heard somebody yell, 'Every
body grab a man, and somebody
gdl the axe!' The next thing I
knew I had it. I started to run,
with the idea of getting it home,
since I lived near there, but the
thing was too heavy."
With a howling mob after him,
unsure whether it was friend or foe
(a number of Stanford men had
joined the crowd by :then but they
were heavily outnumbered), he
threw the axe to Fondini Bacigalupi,
who, when he becam'e " exhausted,
relayed it to Bill Drumm.
HURDLER STARTS
TO RUN WITH AXE
In the mob was a Stanford hur
dler named Stout; watching his
chance he stuck with Drumm.
Drumm, also exhausted, unknow
ingly handed the prize over to him,
and then Stout started to run. Stan
ford would have recovered the axe
right then if littlp Jimmy Hopper,
Berkeley's wonder quarterback, had
not ..been among those present. He

brought down Stout with a very il
legal flying tackle, and recovered
the weapon. The battle then turned
into a triumphal march.
In the meantime Senator-to-be
Hayden had called the police saying
that a crowd' of U.C. students had
stolen a valuable souvenir in the
form of an axe, and were making
away with it in a stolen horse and
wagon. The chief wanted a descrip
tion of the horse and wagon but
Hayden howled back over the phone:
"To helj with the horse and
wagon. We want the axe!"
The captors had by this time
abandoned their commandeered
horse and wagon and taken the
street car. With them was Stan
ford's "Crazy Joe" Hamilton, biding
his time, He saw his chance in
Chinatown after the captors had cut
off the handle in a butcher shop.
In a letter written in 1930 to Dink
Temple ton he says:
"I forget whether the axe - was
stolen after the first or second time
I was fired, or after the first time I
flunked. But I had had six months'
newspaper work in San Francisco
and that helped, or rather it should
have helped but didn't. My detail
had been Chinatown, the red-light
district, and the morgue.
FAMILIAR GROUND
NEAR DUPONT STREET
"Consequently . . . near the top
of old Dupont Street ... I was on
familiar ground. But the thing that
has always puzzled me is that ap
parently they were too.
"However, I knew just what to
do. I dived in, grabbed as many legs
as I could, we came down in a bunch
and-1 hollered for the police hoping
that someone I knew would come
along. They punched me around a
bit and because I was still ob
streperous one of them kicked me in
the ribs for good measure. I looked
at him calmly and said, 'I will kill
you if I ever see you again'; he
bowed quite gracefully, they took
the axe. and went away, some of
them remaining a few moments
longer on my carcass discussing to
tally irrelevant things. Then they
also went and the police came.
"I knew a couple of cops, and
we raced for the Ferry. We be
gan arresting suspicious charac
ters till we had quite a huddle.
But we found no axe. It was get
ting late so the cops decided to
call it a day."
Dr. Castlehun was present among
those arrested. And according to
him, this is what happened. The
gang with the axe found the Ferry
building quite crowded with Stan
ford reinforcements and Mr. Ham
ilton's police. After a brief confer
ence it was decided that Cliff Miller,
the only man with an overcoat,
should hide it. Thinking fast, he
spied an unescorted coed, a nodding
acquaintance of his, offered her his
aim, and strolled into the building.
The coed has remained unidentified
to this day. The axe was taken to
Berkeley.
HAMILTON RECOGNIZES
BEAR ASSAILANT
Hamilton met his man that night
at dinner, with the Irwin brothers
and Billy Erb. He says, "... I was
sure I knew him but I couldn't
place the face . . . later it flashed
upon me that this was the man
who had engineered the job on
Dupont Street and had kicked me
in the slats. It seemed just a bit out
of place to attempt to carry out
my threat and I have never seen
him since. That man was Jimmy
Hopper."
Over in Berkeley the first and
wildest of 31 Axe Rallies was taking
place. Twice a Stanford man, Harry
Dutton, had the axe in his hands
during the next two days. Both
times something intervened. Then
a raid was staged on the Chi Psi
house where Charlie Pringle, foot
ball captain and first custodian of
the axe, lived. 'The raiders tore the
house apart, but failed to find the
object of their search.
Battles were numerous from then
on, until the two schools agreed that
the raids were off. Then Will Irwin
planned the last battle of this series
IRWIN EXPELLED
ON EVE OF GRADUATION
Expelled on the eve of graduation
in '9B, he had been coaching the
junior show at California, and re
frained as a matter of honor from
participating in the raids. As soon
as his job was finished, he was free
to go after the Axe. And although
as he expresses it, he was in a
perilous position with the faculty,
he did plan the famous Fence raid
and carried out one end of it.
Faculty agreement had stipu
lated that there would he no more
Axe raids, but liad said nothing
about any other sort of raid. Ir
win's idea was to capture the most
valuable of Cal's trophies, the
Senior Fence, and hold it as

hostage. This he did, with no
hitches, but Cal chose to regard
the raid, as a favor since the fence
was an eyesore, and the Axe
continued to reside in the vaults
of the Berkeley American Trust
For 31 years the Axe belonged to
Cal. Raid after raid was beaten off
or fell through. Each year, before
the Stanford-Cal baseball game, it
was removed from the bank and
turhed over to the new custodian
at the Axe Rally. Berkeleyites
began to feel that the Axe was le
gally theirs.
IMMORTAL "21"
REGAIN AXE IN 1930
Then on April 3, 1930, Stanford
regained the Axe. The "Immortal
21" were organized by Don Kropp
in 1927. Twice they had been within
an ace of recovering the famed
weapon. But each time they had
failed. In '27, Moroni Jameson ac
tually carried the Axe into the
Berkeley bank, but was so com
pletely surrounded that he could
not escape; and in '2B the Axe Custo
dian, after being tackled by Stan
ford men, had fallen on top of the
traditional implement. The delay
had given rescuers time to arrive,
and the attackers were beaten off.
No raid was attempted in '29.
The "21," all from Sequoia, in
cluded: Howard Avery, '3l; Gerald
Bettman, '3l; Robert Loofbourow,
'3l; Matt Lehmann, '3l; Eric Hill,
'29; Louis Ferrino, '3l; Gordon
Snodgrass, '3O; Warren Gage, '3O;
Raymond Walsh, '3O; Abe Jensen, 1

Henry Powell, '29; Edward Soares,
'3O; and Robert Gordon, '3l.
THE "21" DISPERSE
AMONG CALIFORNIANS
On the Thursday morning, the "21"
slipped quietly away from the cam
pus in three cars. They rented a
fourth car in Oakland. Occupants
of one car went directly to the
Greek Theater, the second group
joined the Cal frosh in their march
to the bank, the third parked two
blocks from the bank, and the
fourth were right at the bank.
All but five of the men the rally
edged their way to positions close
to the Axe during the ceremonies.
Ten minutes before the rally closed,
the remaining five left the theater to
take up posts near the armored car.
These were the fake cameramen,
who delayed proceeding so that the
other conspirators could join the
frosh guards on the car's running
boards. As soon as the armored
car pulled away, the "cameramen"
raced back to the bank.
When the armored car arrived

at the bank, the fake cameramen
again began asking for pictures,
so as to give the remaining 21 a
chance to get into position. Fresh
man guards, pleased to be photo
graphed, drew away. Norm Hor
ner, Axe Custodian, inside the car,
began to get restive. Just as he
stepped out onto the sidewalk, an
overcharged flash-bulb was ex
ploded in his face.
At this point Howard Avery drop
ped from the top of the car,
wrenched the Axe from his hands,
passed it through several hands to
Loofbourow, Hill, and Bettman.
Loufbourow calmly tucked it under
his sweater and walked to the
camera car, got in and drove away.
FROM GET-AWAY CAR
TEAR GAS DROPPED
Just as the get-away car left,
Miller dropped the tear gas bomb.
Horner, fighting furiously, was
joined by the frosh guards, and they
swept Avery into the bank. In the
bomb confusion, Kropp and Miller
ransacked the car to make sure they
hadn't seized a fake.
Ferrino and his men blocked every
entrance to the vicinity, delaying any
messages which might be relayed to
the rest of the campus. Then the
rest of the men mixed with the crowd
and passed the word to "go up to
the Campanile and organize a pur
suit party to get the Axe back from
those Stanford men."
This second ruse delayed matters
materially and gave the Axe car a
chance to get away.
Back at Stanford, a wild im
promptu rally was staged. The
Daily put out an extra at 4 o'clock
in the morning, most of the staff
working in the (c pajamas. Tfne
crowd marched from the foot of the
Quad to Encina where the frosh
gleefully joined in, then they went
up the Row picking up most of the
fraternity and sorority inhabitants.

At the post office the fear of retalia
tory raids was expressed and so the
Axe was taken to Roble where Paul
Speegle led the yelling, and the
Roble women, who had all complete
ly forgotten lockouts, took the Axe
in for the night.
Newspapers all over the United
States carried stories of the fa
mous raid. The "21" chose to give
no one leader the credit, and all
laurels and honor were distributed
equally. The Palo Alto American
Trust vaults held the Axe for two
years, and then, in 1933, the col
orful weapon was put up as a
perpetual Big Game trophy.
Probably, if the Axe had not been
stolen, it would have been thrown
into a corner and forgotten. As it
happened, however, the Axe became
the burning symbol of the two
schools' rivalry a rivalry which
has existed since 1891 with only a
three-year lapse.
During 1915-16-17, the Big Game
was played against Santa Clara.
Both U.C. and Stanford had aban
doned American football in 1906,
but Cal chose to return to American
football three years before Stan
ford did. Santa Clara stuck to
rugby, and it is for that reason that
Stanford traditionally plays the
Broncos each season.

Strangest thing about the Stanford Axe is that, while it is the greatest
symbol of the Cal-Stanford rivalry, it, in itself, did more than any other
thing to create that rivalry; and the events surrounding its origin and
checkered history are credited by some authorities with having crystallized
both the Stanford and University of California spirits. .?
It all began back in '9l when Stanford first opened its gates. The
Berkeley Behemoth was settled in its ways with a good 30 years of

down on the Peninsula, it was only

States carried stories of the fa
mous raid. The "21" chose to give
no one leader the credit, and all
laurels and honor were distributed
equally. The Palo Alto American
Trust vaults held the Axe for two
years, and then, in 1933, the col
orful weapon was put up as a
perpetual Big Game trophy.
Probably, if the Axe had not been
stolen, it would have been thrown
into a corner and forgotten. As it
happened, however, the Axe became
the burning symbol of the two
schools' rivalry a rivalry which
has existed since 1891 with only a
three-year lapse.
During 1915-16-17, the Big Game
was played against Santa Clara.
Both U.C. and Stanford had aban
doned American football in 1906,
but Cal chose to return to American
football three years before Stan
ford did. Santa Clara stuck to
rugby, and it is for that reason that
Stanford traditionally plays the
Broncos each season.

Strangest thing about the Stanford Axe is that, while it is the greatest
symbol of the Cal-Stanford rivalry, it, in itself, did more than any other
thing to create that rivalry; and the events surrounding its origin and
checkered history are credited by some authorities with having crystallized
both the Stanford and University of California spirits. .?
It all began back in '9l when Stanford first opened its gates. The
Berkeley Behemoth was settled in its ways with a good 30 years of

tradition under its belt. It had had,
no rivals for three decades, and
when the Palo Altans moved in
down on the Peninsula, it was only
natural that Cal should look down
her regal nose at the upstarts. Also
it was only natural that the Stan
fords should be the cocky little
fellows, resentful of their rivals'
superior attitude.
Events rolled along nicely until.
1899. Stanford had dropped only
one of- the Cal-Stanford baseball
series, even winning the very first
game, played in 1892. It had also
won thq first football game played
the same year, at the Haight Street
Grounds in San Francisco. Serpen
tine was used for the first time then
to decorate the San Francisco -
bound student trains. Cal was be
ginning to realize that the battle
for athletic supremacy was on.
YELL INTRODUCED
BY IRWIN IN '96
In 1896, Will Irwin, together with
Chris Bradley, had introduced the
Axe Yell. It could not have been
equaled as an expression of the
sentiment Stanford held for U.C.
All the bloody associations con
nected with axes touched the kin
dred feeling Stanford held for its
still superior rival.
Then in 1899 a black tragedy
hit the Farm. George Beckett,
captain of the baseball team and
star pitcher, died before the sea
son started. He couldn't be re
placed arid Stanford lost the first
game of the series. It looked as
though the "any-Stanford-man
is - worth two - Cal -men - any - time -
any-place" theory was in for a
nasty set-back.
Desperately the students sought a
way to rebuild team spirit. Out of
this search came the first Big Game
Bonfire and The Axe. At the bon
fire Frank English and Billy Erb,
yell leader in his off-season from
football, produced a huge ten-pound
axe and before a cheering throng
sharpened it to a razor edge. Then,
with the crowd at a fever pitch, they
cut off the head of a blue and gold
effigy with one blow.
ROOTERS TAKE AXE
TO BASEBALL GAME
The great red axe went with the
rooters to the baseball game in San
Francisco, and it was constantly in
evidence. But Stanford lost the
gahie and the series 9-7. Strangely,
it was Cal's place to make the Axe
a 33-year bone of contention. Some
University of California men hadn't
liked that axe and they determined
to take down the Stanford come
uppance a little by stealing it.
Meanwhile the despondent Billy
Erb had given the axe to Carl Hay
den (Hayden grew up to be a U.S.
Senator, but he was only a de
bater then), and he and two com
panions started off dragging the axe
behind them. Tom Mcfadden, 200-
pound Stanford tackle, heard some
Cal men planning the theft. Imme
diately the axe regained some of
its prestige, if only that it gave him
a chance to battle a few Berkeley
ites. He joined the other three and
they started warily off down the
street.
BERKELEY HORDE
FOLLOWS DEFENDERS
A growing horde of Cal men fol
lowed them. The four defenders
took a four-man grip on the prize,
and waited. Then began a fight
which raged over San Francisco for
six or seven hours. At first the melee
was general, then gradually four
radiating lines formed, each man
with his arms locked around the
man in front of him, and the four
Stanford men at the nucleus grim
ly hanging on to their axe.
It was natui-al that their grips
should evetnually break, but Mc-
Fadden managed to last the long
est. Among the Berkeleyites was a
football player, Paul Castlehun. He
is now Dr. Castlehun of San Fran
cisco. In an interview yesterday
he said:
"I heard somebody yell, 'Every
body grab a man, and somebody
gdl the axe!' The next thing I
knew I had it. I started to run,
with the idea of getting it home,
since I lived near there, but the
thing was too heavy."
With a howling mob after him,
unsure whether it was friend or foe
(a number of Stanford men had
joined the crowd by :then but they
were heavily outnumbered), he
threw the axe to Fondini Bacigalupi,
who, when he becam'e " exhausted,
relayed it to Bill Drumm.
HURDLER STARTS
TO RUN WITH AXE
In the mob was a Stanford hur
dler named Stout; watching his
chance he stuck with Drumm.
Drumm, also exhausted, unknow
ingly handed the prize over to him,
and then Stout started to run. Stan
ford would have recovered the axe
right then if littlp Jimmy Hopper,
Berkeley's wonder quarterback, had
not ..been among those present. He

brought down Stout with a very il
legal flying tackle, and recovered
the weapon. The battle then turned
into a triumphal march.
In the meantime Senator-to-be
Hayden had called the police saying
that a crowd' of U.C. students had
stolen a valuable souvenir in the
form of an axe, and were making
away with it in a stolen horse and
wagon. The chief wanted a descrip
tion of the horse and wagon but
Hayden howled back over the phone:
"To helj with the horse and
wagon. We want the axe!"
The captors had by this time
abandoned their commandeered
horse and wagon and taken the
street car. With them was Stan
ford's "Crazy Joe" Hamilton, biding
his time, He saw his chance in
Chinatown after the captors had cut
off the handle in a butcher shop.
In a letter written in 1930 to Dink
Temple ton he says:
"I forget whether the axe - was
stolen after the first or second time
I was fired, or after the first time I
flunked. But I had had six months'
newspaper work in San Francisco
and that helped, or rather it should
have helped but didn't. My detail
had been Chinatown, the red-light
district, and the morgue.
FAMILIAR GROUND
NEAR DUPONT STREET
"Consequently . . . near the top
of old Dupont Street ... I was on
familiar ground. But the thing that
has always puzzled me is that ap
parently they were too.
"However, I knew just what to
do. I dived in, grabbed as many legs
as I could, we came down in a bunch
and-1 hollered for the police hoping
that someone I knew would come
along. They punched me around a
bit and because I was still ob
streperous one of them kicked me in
the ribs for good measure. I looked
at him calmly and said, 'I will kill
you if I ever see you again'; he
bowed quite gracefully, they took
the axe. and went away, some of
them remaining a few moments
longer on my carcass discussing to
tally irrelevant things. Then they
also went and the police came.
"I knew a couple of cops, and
we raced for the Ferry. We be
gan arresting suspicious charac
ters till we had quite a huddle.
But we found no axe. It was get
ting late so the cops decided to
call it a day."
Dr. Castlehun was present among
those arrested. And according to
him, this is what happened. The
gang with the axe found the Ferry
building quite crowded with Stan
ford reinforcements and Mr. Ham
ilton's police. After a brief confer
ence it was decided that Cliff Miller,
the only man with an overcoat,
should hide it. Thinking fast, he
spied an unescorted coed, a nodding
acquaintance of his, offered her his
aim, and strolled into the building.
The coed has remained unidentified
to this day. The axe was taken to
Berkeley.
HAMILTON RECOGNIZES
BEAR ASSAILANT
Hamilton met his man that night
at dinner, with the Irwin brothers
and Billy Erb. He says, "... I was
sure I knew him but I couldn't
place the face . . . later it flashed
upon me that this was the man
who had engineered the job on
Dupont Street and had kicked me
in the slats. It seemed just a bit out
of place to attempt to carry out
my threat and I have never seen
him since. That man was Jimmy
Hopper."
Over in Berkeley the first and
wildest of 31 Axe Rallies was taking
place. Twice a Stanford man, Harry
Dutton, had the axe in his hands
during the next two days. Both
times something intervened. Then
a raid was staged on the Chi Psi
house where Charlie Pringle, foot
ball captain and first custodian of
the axe, lived. 'The raiders tore the
house apart, but failed to find the
object of their search.
Battles were numerous from then
on, until the two schools agreed that
the raids were off. Then Will Irwin
planned the last battle of this series
IRWIN EXPELLED
ON EVE OF GRADUATION
Expelled on the eve of graduation
in '9B, he had been coaching the
junior show at California, and re
frained as a matter of honor from
participating in the raids. As soon
as his job was finished, he was free
to go after the Axe. And although
as he expresses it, he was in a
perilous position with the faculty,
he did plan the famous Fence raid
and carried out one end of it.
Faculty agreement had stipu
lated that there would he no more
Axe raids, but liad said nothing
about any other sort of raid. Ir
win's idea was to capture the most
valuable of Cal's trophies, the
Senior Fence, and hold it as

hostage. This he did, with no
hitches, but Cal chose to regard
the raid, as a favor since the fence
was an eyesore, and the Axe
continued to reside in the vaults
of the Berkeley American Trust
For 31 years the Axe belonged to
Cal. Raid after raid was beaten off
or fell through. Each year, before
the Stanford-Cal baseball game, it
was removed from the bank and
turhed over to the new custodian
at the Axe Rally. Berkeleyites
began to feel that the Axe was le
gally theirs.
IMMORTAL "21"
REGAIN AXE IN 1930
Then on April 3, 1930, Stanford
regained the Axe. The "Immortal
21" were organized by Don Kropp
in 1927. Twice they had been within
an ace of recovering the famed
weapon. But each time they had
failed. In '27, Moroni Jameson ac
tually carried the Axe into the
Berkeley bank, but was so com
pletely surrounded that he could
not escape; and in '2B the Axe Custo
dian, after being tackled by Stan
ford men, had fallen on top of the
traditional implement. The delay
had given rescuers time to arrive,
and the attackers were beaten off.
No raid was attempted in '29.
The "21," all from Sequoia, in
cluded: Howard Avery, '3l; Gerald
Bettman, '3l; Robert Loofbourow,
'3l; Matt Lehmann, '3l; Eric Hill,
'29; Louis Ferrino, '3l; Gordon
Snodgrass, '3O; Warren Gage, '3O;

THE "21" DISPERSE
AMONG CALIFORNIANS
On the Thursday morning, the "21"
slipped quietly away from the cam
pus in three cars. They rented a
fourth car in Oakland. Occupants
of one car went directly to the
Greek Theater, the second group
joined the Cal frosh in their march
to the bank, the third parked two
blocks from the bank, and the
fourth were right at the bank.
All but five of the men the rally
edged their way to positions close
to the Axe during the ceremonies.
Ten minutes before the rally closed,
the remaining five left the theater to
take up posts near the armored car.
These were the fake cameramen,
who delayed proceeding so that the
other conspirators could join the
frosh guards on the car's running
boards. As soon as the armored
car pulled away, the "cameramen"
raced back to the bank.
When the armored car arrived

at the bank, the fake cameramen
again began asking for pictures,
so as to give the remaining 21 a
chance to get into position. Fresh
man guards, pleased to be photo
graphed, drew away. Norm Hor
ner, Axe Custodian, inside the car,
began to get restive. Just as he
stepped out onto the sidewalk, an
overcharged flash-bulb was ex
ploded in his face.
At this point Howard Avery drop
ped from the top of the car,
wrenched the Axe from his hands,
passed it through several hands to
Loofbourow, Hill, and Bettman.
Loufbourow calmly tucked it under
his sweater and walked to the
camera car, got in and drove away.
FROM GET-AWAY CAR
TEAR GAS DROPPED
Just as the get-away car left,
Miller dropped the tear gas bomb.
Horner, fighting furiously, was
joined by the frosh guards, and they
swept Avery into the bank. In the
bomb confusion, Kropp and Miller
ransacked the car to make sure they
hadn't seized a fake.
Ferrino and his men blocked every
entrance to the vicinity, delaying any
messages which might be relayed to
the rest of the campus. Then the
rest of the men mixed with the crowd
and passed the word to "go up to
the Campanile and organize a pur
suit party to get the Axe back from
those Stanford men."
This second ruse delayed matters
materially and gave the Axe car a
chance to get away.
Back at Stanford, a wild im
promptu rally was staged. The
Daily put out an extra at 4 o'clock
in the morning, most of the staff
working in the (c pajamas. Tfne
crowd marched from the foot of the
Quad to Encina where the frosh
gleefully joined in, then they went
up the Row picking up most of the
fraternity and sorority inhabitants.

At the post office the fear of retalia
tory raids was expressed and so the
Axe was taken to Roble where Paul
Speegle led the yelling, and the
Roble women, who had all complete
ly forgotten lockouts, took the Axe
in for the night.
Newspapers all over the United
States carried stories of the fa
mous raid. The "21" chose to give
no one leader the credit, and all
laurels and honor were distributed
equally. The Palo Alto American
Trust vaults held the Axe for two
years, and then, in 1933, the col
orful weapon was put up as a
perpetual Big Game trophy.
Probably, if the Axe had not been
stolen, it would have been thrown
into a corner and forgotten. As it

rest of the men mixed with the crowd
and passed the word to "go up to
the Campanile and organize a pur
suit party to get the Axe back from
those Stanford men."
This second ruse delayed matters
materially and gave the Axe car a
chance to get away.
Back at Stanford, a wild im
promptu rally was staged. The
Daily put out an extra at 4 o'clock
in the morning, most of the staff
working in the (c pajamas. Tfne
crowd marched from the foot of the
Quad to Encina where the frosh
gleefully joined in, then they went
up the Row picking up most of the
fraternity and sorority inhabitants.

At the post office the fear of retalia
tory raids was expressed and so the
Axe was taken to Roble where Paul
Speegle led the yelling, and the
Roble women, who had all complete
ly forgotten lockouts, took the Axe
in for the night.
Newspapers all over the United
States carried stories of the fa
mous raid. The "21" chose to give
no one leader the credit, and all
laurels and honor were distributed
equally. The Palo Alto American
Trust vaults held the Axe for two
years, and then, in 1933, the col
orful weapon was put up as a
perpetual Big Game trophy.
Probably, if the Axe had not been
stolen, it would have been thrown
into a corner and forgotten. As it
happened, however, the Axe became
the burning symbol of the two
schools' rivalry a rivalry which
has existed since 1891 with only a
three-year lapse.
During 1915-16-17, the Big Game
was played against Santa Clara.
Both U.C. and Stanford had aban
doned American football in 1906,
but Cal chose to return to American
football three years before Stan
ford did. Santa Clara stuck to
rugby, and it is for that reason that
Stanford traditionally plays the
Broncos each season.

Strangest thing about the Stanford Axe is that, while it is the greatest
symbol of the Cal-Stanford rivalry, it, in itself, did more than any other
thing to create that rivalry; and the events surrounding its origin and
checkered history are credited by some authorities with having crystallized
both the Stanford and University of California spirits. .?
It all began back in '9l when Stanford first opened its gates. The
Berkeley Behemoth was settled in its ways with a good 30 years of

tradition under its belt. It had had,
no rivals for three decades, and
when the Palo Altans moved in
down on the Peninsula, it was only
natural that Cal should look down
her regal nose at the upstarts. Also
it was only natural that the Stan
fords should be the cocky little
fellows, resentful of their rivals'
superior attitude.
Events rolled along nicely until.
1899. Stanford had dropped only
one of- the Cal-Stanford baseball
series, even winning the very first
game, played in 1892. It had also
won thq first football game played
the same year, at the Haight Street
Grounds in San Francisco. Serpen
tine was used for the first time then
to decorate the San Francisco -
bound student trains. Cal was be
ginning to realize that the battle
for athletic supremacy was on.
YELL INTRODUCED
BY IRWIN IN '96
In 1896, Will Irwin, together with
Chris Bradley, had introduced the
Axe Yell. It could not have been
equaled as an expression of the
sentiment Stanford held for U.C.
All the bloody associations con
nected with axes touched the kin
dred feeling Stanford held for its
still superior rival.
Then in 1899 a black tragedy
hit the Farm. George Beckett,
captain of the baseball team and
star pitcher, died before the sea
son started. He couldn't be re
placed arid Stanford lost the first
game of the series. It looked as
though the "any-Stanford-man
is - worth two - Cal -men - any - time -
any-place" theory was in for a
nasty set-back.
Desperately the students sought a
way to rebuild team spirit. Out of
this search came the first Big Game
Bonfire and The Axe. At the bon
fire Frank English and Billy Erb,
yell leader in his off-season from
football, produced a huge ten-pound
axe and before a cheering throng
sharpened it to a razor edge. Then,
with the crowd at a fever pitch, they
cut off the head of a blue and gold
effigy with one blow.
ROOTERS TAKE AXE
TO BASEBALL GAME
The great red axe went with the
rooters to the baseball game in San
Francisco, and it was constantly in
evidence. But Stanford lost the
gahie and the series 9-7. Strangely,
it was Cal's place to make the Axe
a 33-year bone of contention. Some
University of California men hadn't
liked that axe and they determined
to take down the Stanford come
uppance a little by stealing it.
Meanwhile the despondent Billy
Erb had given the axe to Carl Hay
den (Hayden grew up to be a U.S.
Senator, but he was only a de
bater then), and he and two com
panions started off dragging the axe
behind them. Tom Mcfadden, 200-
pound Stanford tackle, heard some
Cal men planning the theft. Imme
diately the axe regained some of
its prestige, if only that it gave him
a chance to battle a few Berkeley
ites. He joined the other three and
they started warily off down the
street.
BERKELEY HORDE
FOLLOWS DEFENDERS
A growing horde of Cal men fol
lowed them. The four defenders
took a four-man grip on the prize,
and waited. Then began a fight
which raged over San Francisco for
six or seven hours. At first the melee
was general, then gradually four
radiating lines formed, each man
with his arms locked around the
man in front of him, and the four
Stanford men at the nucleus grim
ly hanging on to their axe.
It was natui-al that their grips
should evetnually break, but Mc-
Fadden managed to last the long
est. Among the Berkeleyites was a
football player, Paul Castlehun. He
is now Dr. Castlehun of San Fran
cisco. In an interview yesterday
he said:
"I heard somebody yell, 'Every
body grab a man, and somebody
gdl the axe!' The next thing I
knew I had it. I started to run,
with the idea of getting it home,
since I lived near there, but the
thing was too heavy."
With a howling mob after him,
unsure whether it was friend or foe
(a number of Stanford men had
joined the crowd by :then but they
were heavily outnumbered), he
threw the axe to Fondini Bacigalupi,
who, when he becam'e " exhausted,
relayed it to Bill Drumm.
HURDLER STARTS
TO RUN WITH AXE
In the mob was a Stanford hur
dler named Stout; watching his
chance he stuck with Drumm.
Drumm, also exhausted, unknow
ingly handed the prize over to him,
and then Stout started to run. Stan
ford would have recovered the axe
right then if littlp Jimmy Hopper,
Berkeley's wonder quarterback, had
not ..been among those present. He

brought down Stout with a very il
legal flying tackle, and recovered
the weapon. The battle then turned
into a triumphal march.
In the meantime Senator-to-be
Hayden had called the police saying
that a crowd' of U.C. students had
stolen a valuable souvenir in the
form of an axe, and were making
away with it in a stolen horse and
wagon. The chief wanted a descrip
tion of the horse and wagon but
Hayden howled back over the phone:
"To helj with the horse and
wagon. We want the axe!"
The captors had by this time
abandoned their commandeered
horse and wagon and taken the
street car. With them was Stan
ford's "Crazy Joe" Hamilton, biding
his time, He saw his chance in
Chinatown after the captors had cut
off the handle in a butcher shop.
In a letter written in 1930 to Dink
Temple ton he says:
"I forget whether the axe - was
stolen after the first or second time
I was fired, or after the first time I
flunked. But I had had six months'
newspaper work in San Francisco
and that helped, or rather it should
have helped but didn't. My detail
had been Chinatown, the red-light
district, and the morgue.
FAMILIAR GROUND
NEAR DUPONT STREET
"Consequently . . . near the top
of old Dupont Street ... I was on
familiar ground. But the thing that
has always puzzled me is that ap
parently they were too.
"However, I knew just what to
do. I dived in, grabbed as many legs
as I could, we came down in a bunch
and-1 hollered for the police hoping
that someone I knew would come
along. They punched me around a
bit and because I was still ob
streperous one of them kicked me in
the ribs for good measure. I looked
at him calmly and said, 'I will kill
you if I ever see you again'; he
bowed quite gracefully, they took
the axe. and went away, some of
them remaining a few moments
longer on my carcass discussing to
tally irrelevant things. Then they
also went and the police came.
"I knew a couple of cops, and
we raced for the Ferry. We be
gan arresting suspicious charac
ters till we had quite a huddle.
But we found no axe. It was get
ting late so the cops decided to
call it a day."
Dr. Castlehun was present among
those arrested. And according to
him, this is what happened. The
gang with the axe found the Ferry
building quite crowded with Stan
ford reinforcements and Mr. Ham
ilton's police. After a brief confer
ence it was decided that Cliff Miller,
the only man with an overcoat,
should hide it. Thinking fast, he
spied an unescorted coed, a nodding
acquaintance of his, offered her his
aim, and strolled into the building.
The coed has remained unidentified
to this day. The axe was taken to
Berkeley.
HAMILTON RECOGNIZES
BEAR ASSAILANT
Hamilton met his man that night
at dinner, with the Irwin brothers
and Billy Erb. He says, "... I was
sure I knew him but I couldn't
place the face . . . later it flashed
upon me that this was the man
who had engineered the job on
Dupont Street and had kicked me
in the slats. It seemed just a bit out
of place to attempt to carry out
my threat and I have never seen
him since. That man was Jimmy
Hopper."
Over in Berkeley the first and
wildest of 31 Axe Rallies was taking
place. Twice a Stanford man, Harry
Dutton, had the axe in his hands
during the next two days. Both
times something intervened. Then
a raid was staged on the Chi Psi
house where Charlie Pringle, foot
ball captain and first custodian of
the axe, lived. 'The raiders tore the
house apart, but failed to find the
object of their search.
Battles were numerous from then
on, until the two schools agreed that
the raids were off. Then Will Irwin
planned the last battle of this series
IRWIN EXPELLED
ON EVE OF GRADUATION
Expelled on the eve of graduation
in '9B, he had been coaching the
junior show at California, and re
frained as a matter of honor from
participating in the raids. As soon
as his job was finished, he was free
to go after the Axe. And although
as he expresses it, he was in a
perilous position with the faculty,
he did plan the famous Fence raid
and carried out one end of it.
Faculty agreement had stipu
lated that there would he no more
Axe raids, but liad said nothing
about any other sort of raid. Ir
win's idea was to capture the most
valuable of Cal's trophies, the
Senior Fence, and hold it as

hostage. This he did, with no
hitches, but Cal chose to regard
the raid, as a favor since the fence
was an eyesore, and the Axe
continued to reside in the vaults
of the Berkeley American Trust
For 31 years the Axe belonged to
Cal. Raid after raid was beaten off
or fell through. Each year, before
the Stanford-Cal baseball game, it
was removed from the bank and
turhed over to the new custodian
at the Axe Rally. Berkeleyites
began to feel that the Axe was le
gally theirs.
IMMORTAL "21"
REGAIN AXE IN 1930
Then on April 3, 1930, Stanford
regained the Axe. The "Immortal
21" were organized by Don Kropp
in 1927. Twice they had been within
an ace of recovering the famed
weapon. But each time they had
failed. In '27, Moroni Jameson ac
tually carried the Axe into the
Berkeley bank, but was so com
pletely surrounded that he could
not escape; and in '2B the Axe Custo
dian, after being tackled by Stan
ford men, had fallen on top of the
traditional implement. The delay
had given rescuers time to arrive,
and the attackers were beaten off.
No raid was attempted in '29.
The "21," all from Sequoia, in
cluded: Howard Avery, '3l; Gerald
Bettman, '3l; Robert Loofbourow,
'3l; Matt Lehmann, '3l; Eric Hill,
'29; Louis Ferrino, '3l; Gordon

Henry Powell, '29; Edward Soares,

THE "21" DISPERSE
AMONG CALIFORNIANS
On the Thursday morning, the "21"
slipped quietly away from the cam
pus in three cars. They rented a
fourth car in Oakland. Occupants
of one car went directly to the
Greek Theater, the second group
joined the Cal frosh in their march
to the bank, the third parked two
blocks from the bank, and the
fourth were right at the bank.
All but five of the men the rally
edged their way to positions close
to the Axe during the ceremonies.
Ten minutes before the rally closed,
the remaining five left the theater to
take up posts near the armored car.
These were the fake cameramen,
who delayed proceeding so that the
other conspirators could join the
frosh guards on the car's running
boards. As soon as the armored
car pulled away, the "cameramen"
raced back to the bank.
When the armored car arrived

at the bank, the fake cameramen
again began asking for pictures,
so as to give the remaining 21 a
chance to get into position. Fresh
man guards, pleased to be photo
graphed, drew away. Norm Hor
ner, Axe Custodian, inside the car,
began to get restive. Just as he
stepped out onto the sidewalk, an
overcharged flash-bulb was ex
ploded in his face.
At this point Howard Avery drop
ped from the top of the car,
wrenched the Axe from his hands,
passed it through several hands to
Loofbourow, Hill, and Bettman.
Loufbourow calmly tucked it under
his sweater and walked to the
camera car, got in and drove away.
FROM GET-AWAY CAR
TEAR GAS DROPPED
Just as the get-away car left,
Miller dropped the tear gas bomb.
Horner, fighting furiously, was
joined by the frosh guards, and they
swept Avery into the bank. In the
bomb confusion, Kropp and Miller
ransacked the car to make sure they
hadn't seized a fake.
Ferrino and his men blocked every
entrance to the vicinity, delaying any
messages which might be relayed to
the rest of the campus. Then the
rest of the men mixed with the crowd
and passed the word to "go up to
the Campanile and organize a pur
suit party to get the Axe back from
those Stanford men."
This second ruse delayed matters
materially and gave the Axe car a
chance to get away.
Back at Stanford, a wild im
promptu rally was staged. The
Daily put out an extra at 4 o'clock
in the morning, most of the staff
working in the (c pajamas. Tfne
crowd marched from the foot of the

fraternity and sorority inhabitants.

began to get restive. Just as he
stepped out onto the sidewalk, an
overcharged flash-bulb was ex
ploded in his face.
At this point Howard Avery drop
ped from the top of the car,
wrenched the Axe from his hands,
passed it through several hands to
Loofbourow, Hill, and Bettman.
Loufbourow calmly tucked it under
his sweater and walked to the
camera car, got in and drove away.
FROM GET-AWAY CAR
TEAR GAS DROPPED
Just as the get-away car left,
Miller dropped the tear gas bomb.
Horner, fighting furiously, was
joined by the frosh guards, and they
swept Avery into the bank. In the
bomb confusion, Kropp and Miller
ransacked the car to make sure they
hadn't seized a fake.
Ferrino and his men blocked every
entrance to the vicinity, delaying any
messages which might be relayed to
the rest of the campus. Then the
rest of the men mixed with the crowd
and passed the word to "go up to
the Campanile and organize a pur
suit party to get the Axe back from
those Stanford men."
This second ruse delayed matters
materially and gave the Axe car a
chance to get away.
Back at Stanford, a wild im
promptu rally was staged. The
Daily put out an extra at 4 o'clock
in the morning, most of the staff
working in the (c pajamas. Tfne
crowd marched from the foot of the
Quad to Encina where the frosh
gleefully joined in, then they went
up the Row picking up most of the
fraternity and sorority inhabitants.

At the post office the fear of retalia
tory raids was expressed and so the
Axe was taken to Roble where Paul
Speegle led the yelling, and the
Roble women, who had all complete
ly forgotten lockouts, took the Axe
in for the night.
Newspapers all over the United
States carried stories of the fa
mous raid. The "21" chose to give
no one leader the credit, and all
laurels and honor were distributed
equally. The Palo Alto American
Trust vaults held the Axe for two
years, and then, in 1933, the col
orful weapon was put up as a
perpetual Big Game trophy.
Probably, if the Axe had not been
stolen, it would have been thrown
into a corner and forgotten. As it
happened, however, the Axe became
the burning symbol of the two
schools' rivalry a rivalry which
has existed since 1891 with only a
three-year lapse.
During 1915-16-17, the Big Game
was played against Santa Clara.
Both U.C. and Stanford had aban
doned American football in 1906,
but Cal chose to return to American
football three years before Stan
ford did. Santa Clara stuck to
rugby, and it is for that reason that
Stanford traditionally plays the
Broncos each season.

Strangest thing about the Stanford Axe is that, while it is the greatest
symbol of the Cal-Stanford rivalry, it, in itself, did more than any other
thing to create that rivalry; and the events surrounding its origin and
checkered history are credited by some authorities with having crystallized
both the Stanford and University of California spirits. .?
It all began back in '9l when Stanford first opened its gates. The
Berkeley Behemoth was settled in its ways with a good 30 years of

tradition under its belt. It had had,
no rivals for three decades, and
when the Palo Altans moved in
down on the Peninsula, it was only
natural that Cal should look down
her regal nose at the upstarts. Also
it was only natural that the Stan
fords should be the cocky little
fellows, resentful of their rivals'
superior attitude.
Events rolled along nicely until.
1899. Stanford had dropped only
one of- the Cal-Stanford baseball
series, even winning the very first
game, played in 1892. It had also
won thq first football game played
the same year, at the Haight Street
Grounds in San Francisco. Serpen
tine was used for the first time then
to decorate the San Francisco -
bound student trains. Cal was be
ginning to realize that the battle
for athletic supremacy was on.
YELL INTRODUCED
BY IRWIN IN '96
In 1896, Will Irwin, together with
Chris Bradley, had introduced the
Axe Yell. It could not have been
equaled as an expression of the
sentiment Stanford held for U.C.
All the bloody associations con
nected with axes touched the kin
dred feeling Stanford held for its
still superior rival.
Then in 1899 a black tragedy
hit the Farm. George Beckett,
captain of the baseball team and
star pitcher, died before the sea
son started. He couldn't be re
placed arid Stanford lost the first
game of the series. It looked as
though the "any-Stanford-man
is - worth two - Cal -men - any - time -
any-place" theory was in for a
nasty set-back.
Desperately the students sought a
way to rebuild team spirit. Out of
this search came the first Big Game
Bonfire and The Axe. At the bon
fire Frank English and Billy Erb,
yell leader in his off-season from
football, produced a huge ten-pound
axe and before a cheering throng
sharpened it to a razor edge. Then,
with the crowd at a fever pitch, they
cut off the head of a blue and gold
effigy with one blow.
ROOTERS TAKE AXE
TO BASEBALL GAME
The great red axe went with the
rooters to the baseball game in San
Francisco, and it was constantly in
evidence. But Stanford lost the
gahie and the series 9-7. Strangely,
it was Cal's place to make the Axe
a 33-year bone of contention. Some
University of California men hadn't
liked that axe and they determined
to take down the Stanford come
uppance a little by stealing it.
Meanwhile the despondent Billy
Erb had given the axe to Carl Hay
den (Hayden grew up to be a U.S.
Senator, but he was only a de
bater then), and he and two com
panions started off dragging the axe
behind them. Tom Mcfadden, 200-
pound Stanford tackle, heard some
Cal men planning the theft. Imme
diately the axe regained some of
its prestige, if only that it gave him
a chance to battle a few Berkeley
ites. He joined the other three and
they started warily off down the
street.
BERKELEY HORDE
FOLLOWS DEFENDERS
A growing horde of Cal men fol
lowed them. The four defenders
took a four-man grip on the prize,
and waited. Then began a fight
which raged over San Francisco for
six or seven hours. At first the melee
was general, then gradually four
radiating lines formed, each man
with his arms locked around the
man in front of him, and the four
Stanford men at the nucleus grim
ly hanging on to their axe.
It was natui-al that their grips
should evetnually break, but Mc-
Fadden managed to last the long
est. Among the Berkeleyites was a
football player, Paul Castlehun. He
is now Dr. Castlehun of San Fran
cisco. In an interview yesterday
he said:
"I heard somebody yell, 'Every
body grab a man, and somebody
gdl the axe!' The next thing I
knew I had it. I started to run,
with the idea of getting it home,
since I lived near there, but the
thing was too heavy."
With a howling mob after him,
unsure whether it was friend or foe
(a number of Stanford men had
joined the crowd by :then but they
were heavily outnumbered), he
threw the axe to Fondini Bacigalupi,
who, when he becam'e " exhausted,
relayed it to Bill Drumm.
HURDLER STARTS
TO RUN WITH AXE
In the mob was a Stanford hur
dler named Stout; watching his
chance he stuck with Drumm.
Drumm, also exhausted, unknow
ingly handed the prize over to him,
and then Stout started to run. Stan
ford would have recovered the axe
right then if littlp Jimmy Hopper,
Berkeley's wonder quarterback, had
not ..been among those present. He

brought down Stout with a very il
legal flying tackle, and recovered
the weapon. The battle then turned
into a triumphal march.
In the meantime Senator-to-be
Hayden had called the police saying
that a crowd' of U.C. students had
stolen a valuable souvenir in the
form of an axe, and were making
away with it in a stolen horse and
wagon. The chief wanted a descrip
tion of the horse and wagon but
Hayden howled back over the phone:
"To helj with the horse and
wagon. We want the axe!"
The captors had by this time
abandoned their commandeered
horse and wagon and taken the
street car. With them was Stan
ford's "Crazy Joe" Hamilton, biding
his time, He saw his chance in
Chinatown after the captors had cut
off the handle in a butcher shop.
In a letter written in 1930 to Dink
Temple ton he says:
"I forget whether the axe - was
stolen after the first or second time
I was fired, or after the first time I
flunked. But I had had six months'
newspaper work in San Francisco
and that helped, or rather it should
have helped but didn't. My detail
had been Chinatown, the red-light
district, and the morgue.
FAMILIAR GROUND
NEAR DUPONT STREET
"Consequently . . . near the top
of old Dupont Street ... I was on
familiar ground. But the thing that
has always puzzled me is that ap
parently they were too.
"However, I knew just what to
do. I dived in, grabbed as many legs
as I could, we came down in a bunch
and-1 hollered for the police hoping
that someone I knew would come
along. They punched me around a
bit and because I was still ob
streperous one of them kicked me in
the ribs for good measure. I looked
at him calmly and said, 'I will kill
you if I ever see you again'; he
bowed quite gracefully, they took
the axe. and went away, some of
them remaining a few moments
longer on my carcass discussing to
tally irrelevant things. Then they
also went and the police came.
"I knew a couple of cops, and
we raced for the Ferry. We be
gan arresting suspicious charac
ters till we had quite a huddle.
But we found no axe. It was get
ting late so the cops decided to
call it a day."
Dr. Castlehun was present among
those arrested. And according to
him, this is what happened. The
gang with the axe found the Ferry
building quite crowded with Stan
ford reinforcements and Mr. Ham
ilton's police. After a brief confer
ence it was decided that Cliff Miller,
the only man with an overcoat,
should hide it. Thinking fast, he
spied an unescorted coed, a nodding
acquaintance of his, offered her his
aim, and strolled into the building.
The coed has remained unidentified
to this day. The axe was taken to
Berkeley.
HAMILTON RECOGNIZES
BEAR ASSAILANT
Hamilton met his man that night
at dinner, with the Irwin brothers
and Billy Erb. He says, "... I was
sure I knew him but I couldn't
place the face . . . later it flashed
upon me that this was the man
who had engineered the job on
Dupont Street and had kicked me
in the slats. It seemed just a bit out
of place to attempt to carry out
my threat and I have never seen
him since. That man was Jimmy
Hopper."
Over in Berkeley the first and
wildest of 31 Axe Rallies was taking
place. Twice a Stanford man, Harry
Dutton, had the axe in his hands
during the next two days. Both
times something intervened. Then
a raid was staged on the Chi Psi
house where Charlie Pringle, foot
ball captain and first custodian of
the axe, lived. 'The raiders tore the
house apart, but failed to find the
object of their search.
Battles were numerous from then
on, until the two schools agreed that
the raids were off. Then Will Irwin
planned the last battle of this series
IRWIN EXPELLED
ON EVE OF GRADUATION
Expelled on the eve of graduation
in '9B, he had been coaching the
junior show at California, and re
frained as a matter of honor from
participating in the raids. As soon
as his job was finished, he was free
to go after the Axe. And although
as he expresses it, he was in a
perilous position with the faculty,
he did plan the famous Fence raid
and carried out one end of it.
Faculty agreement had stipu
lated that there would he no more
Axe raids, but liad said nothing
about any other sort of raid. Ir
win's idea was to capture the most
valuable of Cal's trophies, the
Senior Fence, and hold it as

hostage. This he did, with no
hitches, but Cal chose to regard
the raid, as a favor since the fence
was an eyesore, and the Axe
continued to reside in the vaults
of the Berkeley American Trust
For 31 years the Axe belonged to
Cal. Raid after raid was beaten off
or fell through. Each year, before
the Stanford-Cal baseball game, it
was removed from the bank and
turhed over to the new custodian
at the Axe Rally. Berkeleyites
began to feel that the Axe was le
gally theirs.
IMMORTAL "21"
REGAIN AXE IN 1930
Then on April 3, 1930, Stanford
regained the Axe. The "Immortal
21" were organized by Don Kropp
in 1927. Twice they had been within
an ace of recovering the famed
weapon. But each time they had
failed. In '27, Moroni Jameson ac
tually carried the Axe into the
Berkeley bank, but was so com
pletely surrounded that he could
not escape; and in '2B the Axe Custo
dian, after being tackled by Stan
ford men, had fallen on top of the
traditional implement. The delay
had given rescuers time to arrive,
and the attackers were beaten off.
No raid was attempted in '29.
The "21," all from Sequoia, in
cluded: Howard Avery, '3l; Gerald
Bettman, '3l; Robert Loofbourow,
'3l; Matt Lehmann, '3l; Eric Hill,
'29; Louis Ferrino, '3l; Gordon

THE "21" DISPERSE
AMONG CALIFORNIANS
On the Thursday morning, the "21"
slipped quietly away from the cam
pus in three cars. They rented a
fourth car in Oakland. Occupants
of one car went directly to the
Greek Theater, the second group
joined the Cal frosh in their march
to the bank, the third parked two
blocks from the bank, and the
fourth were right at the bank.
All but five of the men the rally
edged their way to positions close
to the Axe during the ceremonies.
Ten minutes before the rally closed,
the remaining five left the theater to
take up posts near the armored car.
These were the fake cameramen,
who delayed proceeding so that the
other conspirators could join the
frosh guards on the car's running
boards. As soon as the armored
car pulled away, the "cameramen"
raced back to the bank.
When the armored car arrived

at the bank, the fake cameramen
again began asking for pictures,
so as to give the remaining 21 a
chance to get into position. Fresh
man guards, pleased to be photo
graphed, drew away. Norm Hor
ner, Axe Custodian, inside the car,
began to get restive. Just as he
stepped out onto the sidewalk, an
overcharged flash-bulb was ex
ploded in his face.
At this point Howard Avery drop
ped from the top of the car,
wrenched the Axe from his hands,
passed it through several hands to
Loofbourow, Hill, and Bettman.
Loufbourow calmly tucked it under
his sweater and walked to the
camera car, got in and drove away.
FROM GET-AWAY CAR

Just as the get-away car left,
Miller dropped the tear gas bomb.
Horner, fighting furiously, was
joined by the frosh guards, and they
swept Avery into the bank. In the

ransacked the car to make sure they

Greek Theater, the second group
joined the Cal frosh in their march
to the bank, the third parked two
blocks from the bank, and the
fourth were right at the bank.
All but five of the men the rally
edged their way to positions close
to the Axe during the ceremonies.
Ten minutes before the rally closed,
the remaining five left the theater to
take up posts near the armored car.
These were the fake cameramen,
who delayed proceeding so that the
other conspirators could join the
frosh guards on the car's running
boards. As soon as the armored
car pulled away, the "cameramen"
raced back to the bank.
When the armored car arrived

at the bank, the fake cameramen
again began asking for pictures,
so as to give the remaining 21 a
chance to get into position. Fresh
man guards, pleased to be photo
graphed, drew away. Norm Hor
ner, Axe Custodian, inside the car,
began to get restive. Just as he
stepped out onto the sidewalk, an
overcharged flash-bulb was ex
ploded in his face.
At this point Howard Avery drop
ped from the top of the car,
wrenched the Axe from his hands,
passed it through several hands to
Loofbourow, Hill, and Bettman.
Loufbourow calmly tucked it under
his sweater and walked to the
camera car, got in and drove away.
FROM GET-AWAY CAR
TEAR GAS DROPPED
Just as the get-away car left,
Miller dropped the tear gas bomb.
Horner, fighting furiously, was
joined by the frosh guards, and they
swept Avery into the bank. In the
bomb confusion, Kropp and Miller
ransacked the car to make sure they
hadn't seized a fake.
Ferrino and his men blocked every
entrance to the vicinity, delaying any
messages which might be relayed to
the rest of the campus. Then the
rest of the men mixed with the crowd
and passed the word to "go up to
the Campanile and organize a pur
suit party to get the Axe back from
those Stanford men."
This second ruse delayed matters
materially and gave the Axe car a
chance to get away.
Back at Stanford, a wild im
promptu rally was staged. The
Daily put out an extra at 4 o'clock
in the morning, most of the staff
working in the (c pajamas. Tfne
crowd marched from the foot of the
Quad to Encina where the frosh
gleefully joined in, then they went
up the Row picking up most of the
fraternity and sorority inhabitants.

At the post office the fear of retalia
tory raids was expressed and so the
Axe was taken to Roble where Paul
Speegle led the yelling, and the
Roble women, who had all complete
ly forgotten lockouts, took the Axe
in for the night.
Newspapers all over the United
States carried stories of the fa
mous raid. The "21" chose to give
no one leader the credit, and all
laurels and honor were distributed
equally. The Palo Alto American
Trust vaults held the Axe for two
years, and then, in 1933, the col
orful weapon was put up as a
perpetual Big Game trophy.
Probably, if the Axe had not been
stolen, it would have been thrown
into a corner and forgotten. As it
happened, however, the Axe became
the burning symbol of the two
schools' rivalry a rivalry which
has existed since 1891 with only a
three-year lapse.
During 1915-16-17, the Big Game
was played against Santa Clara.
Both U.C. and Stanford had aban
doned American football in 1906,
but Cal chose to return to American
football three years before Stan
ford did. Santa Clara stuck to
rugby, and it is for that reason that
Stanford traditionally plays the
Broncos each season.

Strangest thing about the Stanford Axe is that, while it is the greatest
symbol of the Cal-Stanford rivalry, it, in itself, did more than any other
thing to create that rivalry; and the events surrounding its origin and
checkered history are credited by some authorities with having crystallized
both the Stanford and University of California spirits. .?
It all began back in '9l when Stanford first opened its gates. The
Berkeley Behemoth was settled in its ways with a good 30 years of

tradition under its belt. It had had,
no rivals for three decades, and
when the Palo Altans moved in
down on the Peninsula, it was only
natural that Cal should look down
her regal nose at the upstarts. Also
it was only natural that the Stan
fords should be the cocky little
fellows, resentful of their rivals'
superior attitude.
Events rolled along nicely until.
1899. Stanford had dropped only
one of- the Cal-Stanford baseball
series, even winning the very first
game, played in 1892. It had also
won thq first football game played
the same year, at the Haight Street
Grounds in San Francisco. Serpen
tine was used for the first time then
to decorate the San Francisco -
bound student trains. Cal was be
ginning to realize that the battle
for athletic supremacy was on.
YELL INTRODUCED
BY IRWIN IN '96
In 1896, Will Irwin, together with
Chris Bradley, had introduced the
Axe Yell. It could not have been
equaled as an expression of the
sentiment Stanford held for U.C.
All the bloody associations con
nected with axes touched the kin
dred feeling Stanford held for its
still superior rival.
Then in 1899 a black tragedy
hit the Farm. George Beckett,
captain of the baseball team and
star pitcher, died before the sea
son started. He couldn't be re
placed arid Stanford lost the first
game of the series. It looked as
though the "any-Stanford-man
is - worth two - Cal -men - any - time -
any-place" theory was in for a
nasty set-back.
Desperately the students sought a
way to rebuild team spirit. Out of
this search came the first Big Game
Bonfire and The Axe. At the bon
fire Frank English and Billy Erb,
yell leader in his off-season from
football, produced a huge ten-pound
axe and before a cheering throng
sharpened it to a razor edge. Then,
with the crowd at a fever pitch, they
cut off the head of a blue and gold
effigy with one blow.
ROOTERS TAKE AXE
TO BASEBALL GAME
The great red axe went with the
rooters to the baseball game in San
Francisco, and it was constantly in
evidence. But Stanford lost the
gahie and the series 9-7. Strangely,
it was Cal's place to make the Axe
a 33-year bone of contention. Some
University of California men hadn't
liked that axe and they determined
to take down the Stanford come
uppance a little by stealing it.
Meanwhile the despondent Billy
Erb had given the axe to Carl Hay
den (Hayden grew up to be a U.S.
Senator, but he was only a de
bater then), and he and two com
panions started off dragging the axe
behind them. Tom Mcfadden, 200-
pound Stanford tackle, heard some
Cal men planning the theft. Imme
diately the axe regained some of
its prestige, if only that it gave him
a chance to battle a few Berkeley
ites. He joined the other three and
they started warily off down the
street.
BERKELEY HORDE
FOLLOWS DEFENDERS
A growing horde of Cal men fol
lowed them. The four defenders
took a four-man grip on the prize,
and waited. Then began a fight
which raged over San Francisco for
six or seven hours. At first the melee
was general, then gradually four
radiating lines formed, each man
with his arms locked around the
man in front of him, and the four
Stanford men at the nucleus grim
ly hanging on to their axe.
It was natui-al that their grips
should evetnually break, but Mc-
Fadden managed to last the long
est. Among the Berkeleyites was a
football player, Paul Castlehun. He
is now Dr. Castlehun of San Fran
cisco. In an interview yesterday
he said:
"I heard somebody yell, 'Every
body grab a man, and somebody
gdl the axe!' The next thing I
knew I had it. I started to run,
with the idea of getting it home,
since I lived near there, but the
thing was too heavy."
With a howling mob after him,
unsure whether it was friend or foe
(a number of Stanford men had
joined the crowd by :then but they
were heavily outnumbered), he
threw the axe to Fondini Bacigalupi,
who, when he becam'e " exhausted,
relayed it to Bill Drumm.
HURDLER STARTS
TO RUN WITH AXE
In the mob was a Stanford hur
dler named Stout; watching his
chance he stuck with Drumm.
Drumm, also exhausted, unknow
ingly handed the prize over to him,
and then Stout started to run. Stan
ford would have recovered the axe
right then if littlp Jimmy Hopper,
Berkeley's wonder quarterback, had
not ..been among those present. He

brought down Stout with a very il
legal flying tackle, and recovered
the weapon. The battle then turned
into a triumphal march.
In the meantime Senator-to-be
Hayden had called the police saying
that a crowd' of U.C. students had
stolen a valuable souvenir in the
form of an axe, and were making
away with it in a stolen horse and
wagon. The chief wanted a descrip
tion of the horse and wagon but
Hayden howled back over the phone:
"To helj with the horse and
wagon. We want the axe!"
The captors had by this time
abandoned their commandeered
horse and wagon and taken the
street car. With them was Stan
ford's "Crazy Joe" Hamilton, biding
his time, He saw his chance in
Chinatown after the captors had cut
off the handle in a butcher shop.
In a letter written in 1930 to Dink
Temple ton he says:
"I forget whether the axe - was
stolen after the first or second time
I was fired, or after the first time I
flunked. But I had had six months'
newspaper work in San Francisco
and that helped, or rather it should
have helped but didn't. My detail
had been Chinatown, the red-light
district, and the morgue.
FAMILIAR GROUND
NEAR DUPONT STREET
"Consequently . . . near the top
of old Dupont Street ... I was on
familiar ground. But the thing that
has always puzzled me is that ap
parently they were too.
"However, I knew just what to
do. I dived in, grabbed as many legs
as I could, we came down in a bunch
and-1 hollered for the police hoping
that someone I knew would come
along. They punched me around a
bit and because I was still ob
streperous one of them kicked me in
the ribs for good measure. I looked
at him calmly and said, 'I will kill
you if I ever see you again'; he
bowed quite gracefully, they took
the axe. and went away, some of
them remaining a few moments
longer on my carcass discussing to
tally irrelevant things. Then they
also went and the police came.
"I knew a couple of cops, and
we raced for the Ferry. We be
gan arresting suspicious charac
ters till we had quite a huddle.
But we found no axe. It was get
ting late so the cops decided to
call it a day."
Dr. Castlehun was present among
those arrested. And according to
him, this is what happened. The
gang with the axe found the Ferry
building quite crowded with Stan
ford reinforcements and Mr. Ham
ilton's police. After a brief confer
ence it was decided that Cliff Miller,
the only man with an overcoat,
should hide it. Thinking fast, he
spied an unescorted coed, a nodding
acquaintance of his, offered her his
aim, and strolled into the building.
The coed has remained unidentified
to this day. The axe was taken to
Berkeley.
HAMILTON RECOGNIZES
BEAR ASSAILANT
Hamilton met his man that night
at dinner, with the Irwin brothers
and Billy Erb. He says, "... I was
sure I knew him but I couldn't
place the face . . . later it flashed
upon me that this was the man
who had engineered the job on
Dupont Street and had kicked me
in the slats. It seemed just a bit out
of place to attempt to carry out
my threat and I have never seen
him since. That man was Jimmy
Hopper."
Over in Berkeley the first and
wildest of 31 Axe Rallies was taking
place. Twice a Stanford man, Harry
Dutton, had the axe in his hands
during the next two days. Both
times something intervened. Then
a raid was staged on the Chi Psi
house where Charlie Pringle, foot
ball captain and first custodian of
the axe, lived. 'The raiders tore the
house apart, but failed to find the
object of their search.
Battles were numerous from then
on, until the two schools agreed that
the raids were off. Then Will Irwin
planned the last battle of this series
IRWIN EXPELLED
ON EVE OF GRADUATION
Expelled on the eve of graduation
in '9B, he had been coaching the
junior show at California, and re
frained as a matter of honor from
participating in the raids. As soon
as his job was finished, he was free
to go after the Axe. And although
as he expresses it, he was in a
perilous position with the faculty,
he did plan the famous Fence raid
and carried out one end of it.
Faculty agreement had stipu
lated that there would he no more
Axe raids, but liad said nothing
about any other sort of raid. Ir
win's idea was to capture the most
valuable of Cal's trophies, the
Senior Fence, and hold it as

hostage. This he did, with no
hitches, but Cal chose to regard
the raid, as a favor since the fence
was an eyesore, and the Axe
continued to reside in the vaults
of the Berkeley American Trust
For 31 years the Axe belonged to
Cal. Raid after raid was beaten off
or fell through. Each year, before
the Stanford-Cal baseball game, it
was removed from the bank and
turhed over to the new custodian
at the Axe Rally. Berkeleyites
began to feel that the Axe was le
gally theirs.
IMMORTAL "21"
REGAIN AXE IN 1930
Then on April 3, 1930, Stanford
regained the Axe. The "Immortal
21" were organized by Don Kropp
in 1927. Twice they had been within
an ace of recovering the famed
weapon. But each time they had
failed. In '27, Moroni Jameson ac
tually carried the Axe into the
Berkeley bank, but was so com
pletely surrounded that he could
not escape; and in '2B the Axe Custo
dian, after being tackled by Stan
ford men, had fallen on top of the
traditional implement. The delay
had given rescuers time to arrive,
and the attackers were beaten off.
No raid was attempted in '29.
The "21," all from Sequoia, in
cluded: Howard Avery, '3l; Gerald
Bettman, '3l; Robert Loofbourow,
'3l; Matt Lehmann, '3l; Eric Hill,
'29; Louis Ferrino, '3l; Gordon
Snodgrass, '3O; Warren Gage, '3O;

Henry Powell, '29; Edward Soares,

THE "21" DISPERSE
AMONG CALIFORNIANS
On the Thursday morning, the "21"
slipped quietly away from the cam
pus in three cars. They rented a
fourth car in Oakland. Occupants
of one car went directly to the
Greek Theater, the second group
joined the Cal frosh in their march
to the bank, the third parked two
blocks from the bank, and the
fourth were right at the bank.
All but five of the men the rally
edged their way to positions close

the remaining five left the theater to

THE "21" DISPERSE
AMONG CALIFORNIANS
On the Thursday morning, the "21"
slipped quietly away from the cam
pus in three cars. They rented a
fourth car in Oakland. Occupants
of one car went directly to the
Greek Theater, the second group
joined the Cal frosh in their march
to the bank, the third parked two
blocks from the bank, and the
fourth were right at the bank.
All but five of the men the rally
edged their way to positions close
to the Axe during the ceremonies.
Ten minutes before the rally closed,
the remaining five left the theater to
take up posts near the armored car.
These were the fake cameramen,
who delayed proceeding so that the
other conspirators could join the
frosh guards on the car's running
boards. As soon as the armored
car pulled away, the "cameramen"
raced back to the bank.
When the armored car arrived

at the bank, the fake cameramen
again began asking for pictures,
so as to give the remaining 21 a
chance to get into position. Fresh
man guards, pleased to be photo
graphed, drew away. Norm Hor
ner, Axe Custodian, inside the car,
began to get restive. Just as he
stepped out onto the sidewalk, an
overcharged flash-bulb was ex
ploded in his face.
At this point Howard Avery drop
ped from the top of the car,
wrenched the Axe from his hands,
passed it through several hands to
Loofbourow, Hill, and Bettman.
Loufbourow calmly tucked it under
his sweater and walked to the
camera car, got in and drove away.
FROM GET-AWAY CAR
TEAR GAS DROPPED
Just as the get-away car left,
Miller dropped the tear gas bomb.
Horner, fighting furiously, was
joined by the frosh guards, and they
swept Avery into the bank. In the
bomb confusion, Kropp and Miller
ransacked the car to make sure they
hadn't seized a fake.
Ferrino and his men blocked every
entrance to the vicinity, delaying any
messages which might be relayed to
the rest of the campus. Then the
rest of the men mixed with the crowd
and passed the word to "go up to
the Campanile and organize a pur
suit party to get the Axe back from
those Stanford men."
This second ruse delayed matters
materially and gave the Axe car a
chance to get away.
Back at Stanford, a wild im
promptu rally was staged. The
Daily put out an extra at 4 o'clock
in the morning, most of the staff
working in the (c pajamas. Tfne
crowd marched from the foot of the
Quad to Encina where the frosh
gleefully joined in, then they went
up the Row picking up most of the
fraternity and sorority inhabitants.

At the post office the fear of retalia
tory raids was expressed and so the
Axe was taken to Roble where Paul
Speegle led the yelling, and the
Roble women, who had all complete
ly forgotten lockouts, took the Axe
in for the night.
Newspapers all over the United
States carried stories of the fa
mous raid. The "21" chose to give
no one leader the credit, and all
laurels and honor were distributed
equally. The Palo Alto American
Trust vaults held the Axe for two
years, and then, in 1933, the col
orful weapon was put up as a
perpetual Big Game trophy.
Probably, if the Axe had not been
stolen, it would have been thrown
into a corner and forgotten. As it
happened, however, the Axe became
the burning symbol of the two
schools' rivalry a rivalry which
has existed since 1891 with only a
three-year lapse.
During 1915-16-17, the Big Game
was played against Santa Clara.
Both U.C. and Stanford had aban
doned American football in 1906,
but Cal chose to return to American
football three years before Stan
ford did. Santa Clara stuck to
rugby, and it is for that reason that
Stanford traditionally plays the
Broncos each season.

Strangest thing about the Stanford Axe is that, while it is the greatest
symbol of the Cal-Stanford rivalry, it, in itself, did more than any other
thing to create that rivalry; and the events surrounding its origin and
checkered history are credited by some authorities with having crystallized
both the Stanford and University of California spirits. .?
It all began back in '9l when Stanford first opened its gates. The
Berkeley Behemoth was settled in its ways with a good 30 years of

tradition under its belt. It had had,
no rivals for three decades, and
when the Palo Altans moved in
down on the Peninsula, it was only
natural that Cal should look down
her regal nose at the upstarts. Also
it was only natural that the Stan
fords should be the cocky little
fellows, resentful of their rivals'
superior attitude.
Events rolled along nicely until.
1899. Stanford had dropped only
one of- the Cal-Stanford baseball
series, even winning the very first
game, played in 1892. It had also
won thq first football game played
the same year, at the Haight Street
Grounds in San Francisco. Serpen
tine was used for the first time then
to decorate the San Francisco -
bound student trains. Cal was be
ginning to realize that the battle
for athletic supremacy was on.
YELL INTRODUCED
BY IRWIN IN '96
In 1896, Will Irwin, together with
Chris Bradley, had introduced the
Axe Yell. It could not have been
equaled as an expression of the
sentiment Stanford held for U.C.
All the bloody associations con
nected with axes touched the kin
dred feeling Stanford held for its
still superior rival.
Then in 1899 a black tragedy
hit the Farm. George Beckett,
captain of the baseball team and
star pitcher, died before the sea
son started. He couldn't be re
placed arid Stanford lost the first
game of the series. It looked as
though the "any-Stanford-man
is - worth two - Cal -men - any - time -
any-place" theory was in for a
nasty set-back.
Desperately the students sought a
way to rebuild team spirit. Out of
this search came the first Big Game
Bonfire and The Axe. At the bon
fire Frank English and Billy Erb,
yell leader in his off-season from
football, produced a huge ten-pound
axe and before a cheering throng
sharpened it to a razor edge. Then,
with the crowd at a fever pitch, they
cut off the head of a blue and gold
effigy with one blow.
ROOTERS TAKE AXE
TO BASEBALL GAME
The great red axe went with the
rooters to the baseball game in San
Francisco, and it was constantly in
evidence. But Stanford lost the
gahie and the series 9-7. Strangely,
it was Cal's place to make the Axe
a 33-year bone of contention. Some
University of California men hadn't
liked that axe and they determined
to take down the Stanford come
uppance a little by stealing it.
Meanwhile the despondent Billy
Erb had given the axe to Carl Hay
den (Hayden grew up to be a U.S.
Senator, but he was only a de
bater then), and he and two com
panions started off dragging the axe
behind them. Tom Mcfadden, 200-
pound Stanford tackle, heard some
Cal men planning the theft. Imme
diately the axe regained some of
its prestige, if only that it gave him
a chance to battle a few Berkeley
ites. He joined the other three and
they started warily off down the
street.
BERKELEY HORDE
FOLLOWS DEFENDERS
A growing horde of Cal men fol
lowed them. The four defenders
took a four-man grip on the prize,
and waited. Then began a fight
which raged over San Francisco for
six or seven hours. At first the melee
was general, then gradually four
radiating lines formed, each man
with his arms locked around the
man in front of him, and the four
Stanford men at the nucleus grim
ly hanging on to their axe.
It was natui-al that their grips
should evetnually break, but Mc-
Fadden managed to last the long
est. Among the Berkeleyites was a
football player, Paul Castlehun. He
is now Dr. Castlehun of San Fran
cisco. In an interview yesterday
he said:
"I heard somebody yell, 'Every
body grab a man, and somebody
gdl the axe!' The next thing I
knew I had it. I started to run,
with the idea of getting it home,
since I lived near there, but the
thing was too heavy."
With a howling mob after him,
unsure whether it was friend or foe
(a number of Stanford men had
joined the crowd by :then but they
were heavily outnumbered), he
threw the axe to Fondini Bacigalupi,
who, when he becam'e " exhausted,
relayed it to Bill Drumm.
HURDLER STARTS
TO RUN WITH AXE
In the mob was a Stanford hur
dler named Stout; watching his
chance he stuck with Drumm.
Drumm, also exhausted, unknow
ingly handed the prize over to him,
and then Stout started to run. Stan
ford would have recovered the axe
right then if littlp Jimmy Hopper,
Berkeley's wonder quarterback, had
not ..been among those present. He

brought down Stout with a very il
legal flying tackle, and recovered
the weapon. The battle then turned
into a triumphal march.
In the meantime Senator-to-be
Hayden had called the police saying
that a crowd' of U.C. students had
stolen a valuable souvenir in the
form of an axe, and were making
away with it in a stolen horse and
wagon. The chief wanted a descrip
tion of the horse and wagon but
Hayden howled back over the phone:
"To helj with the horse and
wagon. We want the axe!"
The captors had by this time
abandoned their commandeered
horse and wagon and taken the
street car. With them was Stan
ford's "Crazy Joe" Hamilton, biding
his time, He saw his chance in
Chinatown after the captors had cut
off the handle in a butcher shop.
In a letter written in 1930 to Dink
Temple ton he says:
"I forget whether the axe - was
stolen after the first or second time
I was fired, or after the first time I
flunked. But I had had six months'
newspaper work in San Francisco
and that helped, or rather it should
have helped but didn't. My detail
had been Chinatown, the red-light
district, and the morgue.
FAMILIAR GROUND
NEAR DUPONT STREET
"Consequently . . . near the top
of old Dupont Street ... I was on
familiar ground. But the thing that
has always puzzled me is that ap
parently they were too.
"However, I knew just what to
do. I dived in, grabbed as many legs
as I could, we came down in a bunch
and-1 hollered for the police hoping
that someone I knew would come
along. They punched me around a
bit and because I was still ob
streperous one of them kicked me in
the ribs for good measure. I looked
at him calmly and said, 'I will kill
you if I ever see you again'; he
bowed quite gracefully, they took
the axe. and went away, some of
them remaining a few moments
longer on my carcass discussing to
tally irrelevant things. Then they
also went and the police came.
"I knew a couple of cops, and
we raced for the Ferry. We be
gan arresting suspicious charac
ters till we had quite a huddle.
But we found no axe. It was get
ting late so the cops decided to
call it a day."
Dr. Castlehun was present among
those arrested. And according to
him, this is what happened. The
gang with the axe found the Ferry
building quite crowded with Stan
ford reinforcements and Mr. Ham
ilton's police. After a brief confer
ence it was decided that Cliff Miller,
the only man with an overcoat,
should hide it. Thinking fast, he
spied an unescorted coed, a nodding
acquaintance of his, offered her his
aim, and strolled into the building.
The coed has remained unidentified
to this day. The axe was taken to
Berkeley.
HAMILTON RECOGNIZES
BEAR ASSAILANT
Hamilton met his man that night
at dinner, with the Irwin brothers
and Billy Erb. He says, "... I was
sure I knew him but I couldn't
place the face . . . later it flashed
upon me that this was the man
who had engineered the job on
Dupont Street and had kicked me
in the slats. It seemed just a bit out
of place to attempt to carry out
my threat and I have never seen
him since. That man was Jimmy
Hopper."
Over in Berkeley the first and
wildest of 31 Axe Rallies was taking
place. Twice a Stanford man, Harry
Dutton, had the axe in his hands
during the next two days. Both
times something intervened. Then
a raid was staged on the Chi Psi
house where Charlie Pringle, foot
ball captain and first custodian of
the axe, lived. 'The raiders tore the
house apart, but failed to find the
object of their search.
Battles were numerous from then
on, until the two schools agreed that
the raids were off. Then Will Irwin
planned the last battle of this series
IRWIN EXPELLED
ON EVE OF GRADUATION
Expelled on the eve of graduation
in '9B, he had been coaching the
junior show at California, and re
frained as a matter of honor from
participating in the raids. As soon
as his job was finished, he was free
to go after the Axe. And although
as he expresses it, he was in a
perilous position with the faculty,
he did plan the famous Fence raid
and carried out one end of it.
Faculty agreement had stipu
lated that there would he no more
Axe raids, but liad said nothing
about any other sort of raid. Ir
win's idea was to capture the most
valuable of Cal's trophies, the
Senior Fence, and hold it as

hostage. This he did, with no
hitches, but Cal chose to regard
the raid, as a favor since the fence
was an eyesore, and the Axe
continued to reside in the vaults
of the Berkeley American Trust
For 31 years the Axe belonged to
Cal. Raid after raid was beaten off
or fell through. Each year, before
the Stanford-Cal baseball game, it
was removed from the bank and
turhed over to the new custodian
at the Axe Rally. Berkeleyites
began to feel that the Axe was le
gally theirs.
IMMORTAL "21"
REGAIN AXE IN 1930
Then on April 3, 1930, Stanford
regained the Axe. The "Immortal
21" were organized by Don Kropp
in 1927. Twice they had been within
an ace of recovering the famed
weapon. But each time they had
failed. In '27, Moroni Jameson ac
tually carried the Axe into the
Berkeley bank, but was so com
pletely surrounded that he could
not escape; and in '2B the Axe Custo
dian, after being tackled by Stan
ford men, had fallen on top of the
traditional implement. The delay
had given rescuers time to arrive,
and the attackers were beaten off.
No raid was attempted in '29.

at the Axe Rally. Berkeleyites
began to feel that the Axe was le
gally theirs.
IMMORTAL "21"
REGAIN AXE IN 1930
Then on April 3, 1930, Stanford
regained the Axe. The "Immortal
21" were organized by Don Kropp
in 1927. Twice they had been within
an ace of recovering the famed
weapon. But each time they had
failed. In '27, Moroni Jameson ac
tually carried the Axe into the
Berkeley bank, but was so com
pletely surrounded that he could
not escape; and in '2B the Axe Custo
dian, after being tackled by Stan
ford men, had fallen on top of the
traditional implement. The delay
had given rescuers time to arrive,
and the attackers were beaten off.
No raid was attempted in '29.
The "21," all from Sequoia, in
cluded: Howard Avery, '3l; Gerald
Bettman, '3l; Robert Loofbourow,

THE "21" DISPERSE
AMONG CALIFORNIANS
On the Thursday morning, the "21"
slipped quietly away from the cam
pus in three cars. They rented a
fourth car in Oakland. Occupants
of one car went directly to the
Greek Theater, the second group
joined the Cal frosh in their march
to the bank, the third parked two
blocks from the bank, and the
fourth were right at the bank.
All but five of the men the rally
edged their way to positions close
to the Axe during the ceremonies.
Ten minutes before the rally closed,
the remaining five left the theater to
take up posts near the armored car.
These were the fake cameramen,
who delayed proceeding so that the
other conspirators could join the
frosh guards on the car's running
boards. As soon as the armored
car pulled away, the "cameramen"
raced back to the bank.
When the armored car arrived

at the bank, the fake cameramen
again began asking for pictures,
so as to give the remaining 21 a
chance to get into position. Fresh
man guards, pleased to be photo
graphed, drew away. Norm Hor
ner, Axe Custodian, inside the car,
began to get restive. Just as he
stepped out onto the sidewalk, an
overcharged flash-bulb was ex
ploded in his face.
At this point Howard Avery drop
ped from the top of the car,
wrenched the Axe from his hands,
passed it through several hands to
Loofbourow, Hill, and Bettman.
Loufbourow calmly tucked it under
his sweater and walked to the
camera car, got in and drove away.
FROM GET-AWAY CAR
TEAR GAS DROPPED
Just as the get-away car left,
Miller dropped the tear gas bomb.
Horner, fighting furiously, was
joined by the frosh guards, and they
swept Avery into the bank. In the
bomb confusion, Kropp and Miller
ransacked the car to make sure they
hadn't seized a fake.
Ferrino and his men blocked every
entrance to the vicinity, delaying any
messages which might be relayed to
the rest of the campus. Then the
rest of the men mixed with the crowd
and passed the word to "go up to
the Campanile and organize a pur
suit party to get the Axe back from
those Stanford men."
This second ruse delayed matters
materially and gave the Axe car a
chance to get away.
Back at Stanford, a wild im
promptu rally was staged. The
Daily put out an extra at 4 o'clock
in the morning, most of the staff
working in the (c pajamas. Tfne
crowd marched from the foot of the
Quad to Encina where the frosh
gleefully joined in, then they went
up the Row picking up most of the
fraternity and sorority inhabitants.

At the post office the fear of retalia
tory raids was expressed and so the
Axe was taken to Roble where Paul
Speegle led the yelling, and the
Roble women, who had all complete
ly forgotten lockouts, took the Axe
in for the night.
Newspapers all over the United
States carried stories of the fa
mous raid. The "21" chose to give
no one leader the credit, and all
laurels and honor were distributed
equally. The Palo Alto American
Trust vaults held the Axe for two
years, and then, in 1933, the col
orful weapon was put up as a
perpetual Big Game trophy.
Probably, if the Axe had not been
stolen, it would have been thrown
into a corner and forgotten. As it
happened, however, the Axe became
the burning symbol of the two
schools' rivalry a rivalry which
has existed since 1891 with only a
three-year lapse.
During 1915-16-17, the Big Game
was played against Santa Clara.
Both U.C. and Stanford had aban
doned American football in 1906,
but Cal chose to return to American
football three years before Stan
ford did. Santa Clara stuck to
rugby, and it is for that reason that
Stanford traditionally plays the
Broncos each season.

Strangest thing about the Stanford Axe is that, while it is the greatest
symbol of the Cal-Stanford rivalry, it, in itself, did more than any other
thing to create that rivalry; and the events surrounding its origin and
checkered history are credited by some authorities with having crystallized
both the Stanford and University of California spirits. .?
It all began back in '9l when Stanford first opened its gates. The
Berkeley Behemoth was settled in its ways with a good 30 years of

tradition under its belt. It had had,
no rivals for three decades, and
when the Palo Altans moved in
down on the Peninsula, it was only
natural that Cal should look down
her regal nose at the upstarts. Also
it was only natural that the Stan
fords should be the cocky little
fellows, resentful of their rivals'
superior attitude.
Events rolled along nicely until.
1899. Stanford had dropped only
one of- the Cal-Stanford baseball
series, even winning the very first
game, played in 1892. It had also
won thq first football game played
the same year, at the Haight Street
Grounds in San Francisco. Serpen
tine was used for the first time then
to decorate the San Francisco -
bound student trains. Cal was be
ginning to realize that the battle
for athletic supremacy was on.
YELL INTRODUCED
BY IRWIN IN '96
In 1896, Will Irwin, together with
Chris Bradley, had introduced the
Axe Yell. It could not have been
equaled as an expression of the
sentiment Stanford held for U.C.
All the bloody associations con
nected with axes touched the kin
dred feeling Stanford held for its
still superior rival.
Then in 1899 a black tragedy
hit the Farm. George Beckett,
captain of the baseball team and
star pitcher, died before the sea
son started. He couldn't be re
placed arid Stanford lost the first
game of the series. It looked as
though the "any-Stanford-man
is - worth two - Cal -men - any - time -
any-place" theory was in for a
nasty set-back.
Desperately the students sought a
way to rebuild team spirit. Out of
this search came the first Big Game
Bonfire and The Axe. At the bon
fire Frank English and Billy Erb,
yell leader in his off-season from
football, produced a huge ten-pound
axe and before a cheering throng
sharpened it to a razor edge. Then,
with the crowd at a fever pitch, they
cut off the head of a blue and gold
effigy with one blow.
ROOTERS TAKE AXE
TO BASEBALL GAME
The great red axe went with the
rooters to the baseball game in San
Francisco, and it was constantly in
evidence. But Stanford lost the
gahie and the series 9-7. Strangely,
it was Cal's place to make the Axe
a 33-year bone of contention. Some
University of California men hadn't
liked that axe and they determined
to take down the Stanford come
uppance a little by stealing it.
Meanwhile the despondent Billy
Erb had given the axe to Carl Hay
den (Hayden grew up to be a U.S.
Senator, but he was only a de
bater then), and he and two com
panions started off dragging the axe
behind them. Tom Mcfadden, 200-
pound Stanford tackle, heard some
Cal men planning the theft. Imme
diately the axe regained some of
its prestige, if only that it gave him
a chance to battle a few Berkeley
ites. He joined the other three and
they started warily off down the
street.
BERKELEY HORDE
FOLLOWS DEFENDERS
A growing horde of Cal men fol
lowed them. The four defenders
took a four-man grip on the prize,
and waited. Then began a fight
which raged over San Francisco for
six or seven hours. At first the melee
was general, then gradually four
radiating lines formed, each man
with his arms locked around the
man in front of him, and the four
Stanford men at the nucleus grim
ly hanging on to their axe.
It was natui-al that their grips
should evetnually break, but Mc-
Fadden managed to last the long
est. Among the Berkeleyites was a
football player, Paul Castlehun. He
is now Dr. Castlehun of San Fran
cisco. In an interview yesterday
he said:
"I heard somebody yell, 'Every
body grab a man, and somebody
gdl the axe!' The next thing I
knew I had it. I started to run,
with the idea of getting it home,
since I lived near there, but the
thing was too heavy."
With a howling mob after him,
unsure whether it was friend or foe
(a number of Stanford men had
joined the crowd by :then but they
were heavily outnumbered), he
threw the axe to Fondini Bacigalupi,
who, when he becam'e " exhausted,
relayed it to Bill Drumm.
HURDLER STARTS
TO RUN WITH AXE
In the mob was a Stanford hur
dler named Stout; watching his
chance he stuck with Drumm.
Drumm, also exhausted, unknow
ingly handed the prize over to him,
and then Stout started to run. Stan
ford would have recovered the axe
right then if littlp Jimmy Hopper,
Berkeley's wonder quarterback, had
not ..been among those present. He

brought down Stout with a very il
legal flying tackle, and recovered
the weapon. The battle then turned
into a triumphal march.
In the meantime Senator-to-be
Hayden had called the police saying
that a crowd' of U.C. students had
stolen a valuable souvenir in the
form of an axe, and were making
away with it in a stolen horse and
wagon. The chief wanted a descrip
tion of the horse and wagon but
Hayden howled back over the phone:
"To helj with the horse and
wagon. We want the axe!"
The captors had by this time
abandoned their commandeered
horse and wagon and taken the
street car. With them was Stan
ford's "Crazy Joe" Hamilton, biding
his time, He saw his chance in
Chinatown after the captors had cut
off the handle in a butcher shop.
In a letter written in 1930 to Dink
Temple ton he says:
"I forget whether the axe - was
stolen after the first or second time
I was fired, or after the first time I
flunked. But I had had six months'
newspaper work in San Francisco
and that helped, or rather it should
have helped but didn't. My detail
had been Chinatown, the red-light
district, and the morgue.
FAMILIAR GROUND
NEAR DUPONT STREET
"Consequently . . . near the top
of old Dupont Street ... I was on
familiar ground. But the thing that
has always puzzled me is that ap
parently they were too.
"However, I knew just what to
do. I dived in, grabbed as many legs
as I could, we came down in a bunch
and-1 hollered for the police hoping
that someone I knew would come
along. They punched me around a
bit and because I was still ob
streperous one of them kicked me in
the ribs for good measure. I looked
at him calmly and said, 'I will kill
you if I ever see you again'; he
bowed quite gracefully, they took
the axe. and went away, some of
them remaining a few moments
longer on my carcass discussing to
tally irrelevant things. Then they
also went and the police came.
"I knew a couple of cops, and
we raced for the Ferry. We be
gan arresting suspicious charac
ters till we had quite a huddle.
But we found no axe. It was get
ting late so the cops decided to
call it a day."
Dr. Castlehun was present among
those arrested. And according to
him, this is what happened. The
gang with the axe found the Ferry
building quite crowded with Stan
ford reinforcements and Mr. Ham
ilton's police. After a brief confer
ence it was decided that Cliff Miller,
the only man with an overcoat,
should hide it. Thinking fast, he
spied an unescorted coed, a nodding
acquaintance of his, offered her his
aim, and strolled into the building.
The coed has remained unidentified
to this day. The axe was taken to
Berkeley.
HAMILTON RECOGNIZES
BEAR ASSAILANT
Hamilton met his man that night
at dinner, with the Irwin brothers
and Billy Erb. He says, "... I was
sure I knew him but I couldn't
place the face . . . later it flashed
upon me that this was the man
who had engineered the job on
Dupont Street and had kicked me
in the slats. It seemed just a bit out
of place to attempt to carry out
my threat and I have never seen
him since. That man was Jimmy
Hopper."
Over in Berkeley the first and
wildest of 31 Axe Rallies was taking
place. Twice a Stanford man, Harry
Dutton, had the axe in his hands
during the next two days. Both
times something intervened. Then
a raid was staged on the Chi Psi
house where Charlie Pringle, foot
ball captain and first custodian of
the axe, lived. 'The raiders tore the
house apart, but failed to find the
object of their search.
Battles were numerous from then
on, until the two schools agreed that
the raids were off. Then Will Irwin
planned the last battle of this series
IRWIN EXPELLED
ON EVE OF GRADUATION
Expelled on the eve of graduation
in '9B, he had been coaching the
junior show at California, and re
frained as a matter of honor from
participating in the raids. As soon
as his job was finished, he was free
to go after the Axe. And although
as he expresses it, he was in a
perilous position with the faculty,
he did plan the famous Fence raid
and carried out one end of it.
Faculty agreement had stipu
lated that there would he no more
Axe raids, but liad said nothing
about any other sort of raid. Ir
win's idea was to capture the most
valuable of Cal's trophies, the
Senior Fence, and hold it as

hostage. This he did, with no
hitches, but Cal chose to regard
the raid, as a favor since the fence
was an eyesore, and the Axe
continued to reside in the vaults
of the Berkeley American Trust
For 31 years the Axe belonged to
Cal. Raid after raid was beaten off
or fell through. Each year, before
the Stanford-Cal baseball game, it
was removed from the bank and
turhed over to the new custodian
at the Axe Rally. Berkeleyites
began to feel that the Axe was le
gally theirs.

as his job was finished, he was free
to go after the Axe. And although
as he expresses it, he was in a
perilous position with the faculty,
he did plan the famous Fence raid
and carried out one end of it.
Faculty agreement had stipu
lated that there would he no more
Axe raids, but liad said nothing
about any other sort of raid. Ir
win's idea was to capture the most
valuable of Cal's trophies, the
Senior Fence, and hold it as

hostage. This he did, with no
hitches, but Cal chose to regard
the raid, as a favor since the fence
was an eyesore, and the Axe
continued to reside in the vaults
of the Berkeley American Trust
For 31 years the Axe belonged to
Cal. Raid after raid was beaten off
or fell through. Each year, before
the Stanford-Cal baseball game, it
was removed from the bank and
turhed over to the new custodian
at the Axe Rally. Berkeleyites
began to feel that the Axe was le
gally theirs.
IMMORTAL "21"
REGAIN AXE IN 1930
Then on April 3, 1930, Stanford
regained the Axe. The "Immortal
21" were organized by Don Kropp
in 1927. Twice they had been within
an ace of recovering the famed
weapon. But each time they had
failed. In '27, Moroni Jameson ac
tually carried the Axe into the
Berkeley bank, but was so com
pletely surrounded that he could
not escape; and in '2B the Axe Custo
dian, after being tackled by Stan
ford men, had fallen on top of the
traditional implement. The delay
had given rescuers time to arrive,
and the attackers were beaten off.
No raid was attempted in '29.
The "21," all from Sequoia, in
cluded: Howard Avery, '3l; Gerald
Bettman, '3l; Robert Loofbourow,
'3l; Matt Lehmann, '3l; Eric Hill,
'29; Louis Ferrino, '3l; Gordon

THE "21" DISPERSE
AMONG CALIFORNIANS
On the Thursday morning, the "21"
slipped quietly away from the cam
pus in three cars. They rented a
fourth car in Oakland. Occupants
of one car went directly to the
Greek Theater, the second group
joined the Cal frosh in their march
to the bank, the third parked two
blocks from the bank, and the
fourth were right at the bank.
All but five of the men the rally
edged their way to positions close
to the Axe during the ceremonies.
Ten minutes before the rally closed,
the remaining five left the theater to
take up posts near the armored car.
These were the fake cameramen,
who delayed proceeding so that the
other conspirators could join the
frosh guards on the car's running
boards. As soon as the armored
car pulled away, the "cameramen"
raced back to the bank.
When the armored car arrived

at the bank, the fake cameramen
again began asking for pictures,
so as to give the remaining 21 a
chance to get into position. Fresh
man guards, pleased to be photo
graphed, drew away. Norm Hor
ner, Axe Custodian, inside the car,
began to get restive. Just as he
stepped out onto the sidewalk, an
overcharged flash-bulb was ex
ploded in his face.
At this point Howard Avery drop
ped from the top of the car,
wrenched the Axe from his hands,
passed it through several hands to
Loofbourow, Hill, and Bettman.
Loufbourow calmly tucked it under
his sweater and walked to the
camera car, got in and drove away.
FROM GET-AWAY CAR
TEAR GAS DROPPED
Just as the get-away car left,
Miller dropped the tear gas bomb.
Horner, fighting furiously, was
joined by the frosh guards, and they
swept Avery into the bank. In the
bomb confusion, Kropp and Miller
ransacked the car to make sure they
hadn't seized a fake.
Ferrino and his men blocked every
entrance to the vicinity, delaying any
messages which might be relayed to
the rest of the campus. Then the
rest of the men mixed with the crowd
and passed the word to "go up to
the Campanile and organize a pur
suit party to get the Axe back from
those Stanford men."
This second ruse delayed matters
materially and gave the Axe car a
chance to get away.
Back at Stanford, a wild im
promptu rally was staged. The
Daily put out an extra at 4 o'clock
in the morning, most of the staff
working in the (c pajamas. Tfne
crowd marched from the foot of the
Quad to Encina where the frosh
gleefully joined in, then they went
up the Row picking up most of the
fraternity and sorority inhabitants.

At the post office the fear of retalia
tory raids was expressed and so the
Axe was taken to Roble where Paul
Speegle led the yelling, and the
Roble women, who had all complete
ly forgotten lockouts, took the Axe
in for the night.
Newspapers all over the United
States carried stories of the fa
mous raid. The "21" chose to give
no one leader the credit, and all
laurels and honor were distributed
equally. The Palo Alto American
Trust vaults held the Axe for two
years, and then, in 1933, the col
orful weapon was put up as a
perpetual Big Game trophy.
Probably, if the Axe had not been
stolen, it would have been thrown
into a corner and forgotten. As it
happened, however, the Axe became
the burning symbol of the two
schools' rivalry a rivalry which
has existed since 1891 with only a
three-year lapse.
During 1915-16-17, the Big Game
was played against Santa Clara.
Both U.C. and Stanford had aban
doned American football in 1906,
but Cal chose to return to American
football three years before Stan
ford did. Santa Clara stuck to
rugby, and it is for that reason that
Stanford traditionally plays the
Broncos each season.

Strangest thing about the Stanford Axe is that, while it is the greatest
symbol of the Cal-Stanford rivalry, it, in itself, did more than any other
thing to create that rivalry; and the events surrounding its origin and
checkered history are credited by some authorities with having crystallized
both the Stanford and University of California spirits. .?
It all began back in '9l when Stanford first opened its gates. The
Berkeley Behemoth was settled in its ways with a good 30 years of

tradition under its belt. It had had,
no rivals for three decades, and
when the Palo Altans moved in
down on the Peninsula, it was only
natural that Cal should look down
her regal nose at the upstarts. Also
it was only natural that the Stan
fords should be the cocky little
fellows, resentful of their rivals'
superior attitude.
Events rolled along nicely until.
1899. Stanford had dropped only
one of- the Cal-Stanford baseball
series, even winning the very first
game, played in 1892. It had also
won thq first football game played
the same year, at the Haight Street
Grounds in San Francisco. Serpen
tine was used for the first time then
to decorate the San Francisco -
bound student trains. Cal was be
ginning to realize that the battle
for athletic supremacy was on.
YELL INTRODUCED
BY IRWIN IN '96
In 1896, Will Irwin, together with
Chris Bradley, had introduced the
Axe Yell. It could not have been
equaled as an expression of the
sentiment Stanford held for U.C.
All the bloody associations con
nected with axes touched the kin
dred feeling Stanford held for its
still superior rival.
Then in 1899 a black tragedy
hit the Farm. George Beckett,
captain of the baseball team and
star pitcher, died before the sea
son started. He couldn't be re
placed arid Stanford lost the first
game of the series. It looked as
though the "any-Stanford-man
is - worth two - Cal -men - any - time -
any-place" theory was in for a
nasty set-back.
Desperately the students sought a
way to rebuild team spirit. Out of
this search came the first Big Game
Bonfire and The Axe. At the bon
fire Frank English and Billy Erb,
yell leader in his off-season from
football, produced a huge ten-pound
axe and before a cheering throng
sharpened it to a razor edge. Then,
with the crowd at a fever pitch, they
cut off the head of a blue and gold
effigy with one blow.
ROOTERS TAKE AXE
TO BASEBALL GAME
The great red axe went with the
rooters to the baseball game in San
Francisco, and it was constantly in
evidence. But Stanford lost the
gahie and the series 9-7. Strangely,
it was Cal's place to make the Axe
a 33-year bone of contention. Some
University of California men hadn't
liked that axe and they determined
to take down the Stanford come
uppance a little by stealing it.
Meanwhile the despondent Billy
Erb had given the axe to Carl Hay
den (Hayden grew up to be a U.S.
Senator, but he was only a de
bater then), and he and two com
panions started off dragging the axe
behind them. Tom Mcfadden, 200-
pound Stanford tackle, heard some
Cal men planning the theft. Imme
diately the axe regained some of
its prestige, if only that it gave him
a chance to battle a few Berkeley
ites. He joined the other three and
they started warily off down the
street.
BERKELEY HORDE
FOLLOWS DEFENDERS
A growing horde of Cal men fol
lowed them. The four defenders
took a four-man grip on the prize,
and waited. Then began a fight
which raged over San Francisco for
six or seven hours. At first the melee
was general, then gradually four
radiating lines formed, each man
with his arms locked around the
man in front of him, and the four
Stanford men at the nucleus grim
ly hanging on to their axe.
It was natui-al that their grips
should evetnually break, but Mc-
Fadden managed to last the long
est. Among the Berkeleyites was a
football player, Paul Castlehun. He
is now Dr. Castlehun of San Fran
cisco. In an interview yesterday
he said:
"I heard somebody yell, 'Every
body grab a man, and somebody
gdl the axe!' The next thing I
knew I had it. I started to run,
with the idea of getting it home,
since I lived near there, but the
thing was too heavy."
With a howling mob after him,
unsure whether it was friend or foe
(a number of Stanford men had
joined the crowd by :then but they
were heavily outnumbered), he
threw the axe to Fondini Bacigalupi,
who, when he becam'e " exhausted,
relayed it to Bill Drumm.
HURDLER STARTS
TO RUN WITH AXE
In the mob was a Stanford hur
dler named Stout; watching his
chance he stuck with Drumm.
Drumm, also exhausted, unknow
ingly handed the prize over to him,
and then Stout started to run. Stan
ford would have recovered the axe
right then if littlp Jimmy Hopper,
Berkeley's wonder quarterback, had
not ..been among those present. He

brought down Stout with a very il
legal flying tackle, and recovered
the weapon. The battle then turned
into a triumphal march.
In the meantime Senator-to-be
Hayden had called the police saying
that a crowd' of U.C. students had
stolen a valuable souvenir in the
form of an axe, and were making
away with it in a stolen horse and
wagon. The chief wanted a descrip
tion of the horse and wagon but
Hayden howled back over the phone:
"To helj with the horse and
wagon. We want the axe!"
The captors had by this time
abandoned their commandeered
horse and wagon and taken the
street car. With them was Stan
ford's "Crazy Joe" Hamilton, biding
his time, He saw his chance in
Chinatown after the captors had cut
off the handle in a butcher shop.
In a letter written in 1930 to Dink
Temple ton he says:
"I forget whether the axe - was
stolen after the first or second time
I was fired, or after the first time I
flunked. But I had had six months'
newspaper work in San Francisco
and that helped, or rather it should
have helped but didn't. My detail
had been Chinatown, the red-light
district, and the morgue.
FAMILIAR GROUND
NEAR DUPONT STREET
"Consequently . . . near the top
of old Dupont Street ... I was on
familiar ground. But the thing that
has always puzzled me is that ap
parently they were too.
"However, I knew just what to
do. I dived in, grabbed as many legs
as I could, we came down in a bunch
and-1 hollered for the police hoping
that someone I knew would come
along. They punched me around a
bit and because I was still ob
streperous one of them kicked me in
the ribs for good measure. I looked
at him calmly and said, 'I will kill
you if I ever see you again'; he
bowed quite gracefully, they took
the axe. and went away, some of
them remaining a few moments
longer on my carcass discussing to
tally irrelevant things. Then they
also went and the police came.
"I knew a couple of cops, and
we raced for the Ferry. We be
gan arresting suspicious charac
ters till we had quite a huddle.
But we found no axe. It was get
ting late so the cops decided to
call it a day."
Dr. Castlehun was present among
those arrested. And according to
him, this is what happened. The
gang with the axe found the Ferry
building quite crowded with Stan
ford reinforcements and Mr. Ham
ilton's police. After a brief confer
ence it was decided that Cliff Miller,
the only man with an overcoat,
should hide it. Thinking fast, he
spied an unescorted coed, a nodding
acquaintance of his, offered her his
aim, and strolled into the building.
The coed has remained unidentified
to this day. The axe was taken to
Berkeley.
HAMILTON RECOGNIZES
BEAR ASSAILANT
Hamilton met his man that night
at dinner, with the Irwin brothers
and Billy Erb. He says, "... I was
sure I knew him but I couldn't
place the face . . . later it flashed
upon me that this was the man
who had engineered the job on
Dupont Street and had kicked me
in the slats. It seemed just a bit out
of place to attempt to carry out
my threat and I have never seen
him since. That man was Jimmy
Hopper."
Over in Berkeley the first and
wildest of 31 Axe Rallies was taking
place. Twice a Stanford man, Harry
Dutton, had the axe in his hands
during the next two days. Both
times something intervened. Then
a raid was staged on the Chi Psi
house where Charlie Pringle, foot
ball captain and first custodian of
the axe, lived. 'The raiders tore the
house apart, but failed to find the
object of their search.
Battles were numerous from then
on, until the two schools agreed that
the raids were off. Then Will Irwin
planned the last battle of this series
IRWIN EXPELLED
ON EVE OF GRADUATION
Expelled on the eve of graduation
in '9B, he had been coaching the
junior show at California, and re
frained as a matter of honor from
participating in the raids. As soon
as his job was finished, he was free
to go after the Axe. And although
as he expresses it, he was in a
perilous position with the faculty,
he did plan the famous Fence raid
and carried out one end of it.
Faculty agreement had stipu
lated that there would he no more
Axe raids, but liad said nothing
about any other sort of raid. Ir
win's idea was to capture the most
valuable of Cal's trophies, the
Senior Fence, and hold it as

of place to attempt to carry out
my threat and I have never seen
him since. That man was Jimmy
Hopper."
Over in Berkeley the first and
wildest of 31 Axe Rallies was taking
place. Twice a Stanford man, Harry
Dutton, had the axe in his hands
during the next two days. Both
times something intervened. Then
a raid was staged on the Chi Psi
house where Charlie Pringle, foot
ball captain and first custodian of
the axe, lived. 'The raiders tore the
house apart, but failed to find the
object of their search.
Battles were numerous from then
on, until the two schools agreed that
the raids were off. Then Will Irwin
planned the last battle of this series
IRWIN EXPELLED
ON EVE OF GRADUATION
Expelled on the eve of graduation
in '9B, he had been coaching the
junior show at California, and re
frained as a matter of honor from
participating in the raids. As soon
as his job was finished, he was free
to go after the Axe. And although
as he expresses it, he was in a
perilous position with the faculty,
he did plan the famous Fence raid
and carried out one end of it.
Faculty agreement had stipu
lated that there would he no more
Axe raids, but liad said nothing
about any other sort of raid. Ir
win's idea was to capture the most
valuable of Cal's trophies, the
Senior Fence, and hold it as

hostage. This he did, with no
hitches, but Cal chose to regard
the raid, as a favor since the fence
was an eyesore, and the Axe
continued to reside in the vaults
of the Berkeley American Trust
For 31 years the Axe belonged to
Cal. Raid after raid was beaten off
or fell through. Each year, before
the Stanford-Cal baseball game, it
was removed from the bank and
turhed over to the new custodian
at the Axe Rally. Berkeleyites
began to feel that the Axe was le
gally theirs.
IMMORTAL "21"
REGAIN AXE IN 1930
Then on April 3, 1930, Stanford
regained the Axe. The "Immortal
21" were organized by Don Kropp
in 1927. Twice they had been within
an ace of recovering the famed
weapon. But each time they had
failed. In '27, Moroni Jameson ac
tually carried the Axe into the
Berkeley bank, but was so com
pletely surrounded that he could
not escape; and in '2B the Axe Custo
dian, after being tackled by Stan
ford men, had fallen on top of the
traditional implement. The delay
had given rescuers time to arrive,
and the attackers were beaten off.
No raid was attempted in '29.

THE "21" DISPERSE
AMONG CALIFORNIANS
On the Thursday morning, the "21"
slipped quietly away from the cam
pus in three cars. They rented a
fourth car in Oakland. Occupants
of one car went directly to the
Greek Theater, the second group
joined the Cal frosh in their march
to the bank, the third parked two
blocks from the bank, and the
fourth were right at the bank.
All but five of the men the rally
edged their way to positions close
to the Axe during the ceremonies.
Ten minutes before the rally closed,
the remaining five left the theater to
take up posts near the armored car.
These were the fake cameramen,
who delayed proceeding so that the
other conspirators could join the
frosh guards on the car's running
boards. As soon as the armored
car pulled away, the "cameramen"
raced back to the bank.
When the armored car arrived

at the bank, the fake cameramen
again began asking for pictures,
so as to give the remaining 21 a
chance to get into position. Fresh
man guards, pleased to be photo
graphed, drew away. Norm Hor
ner, Axe Custodian, inside the car,
began to get restive. Just as he
stepped out onto the sidewalk, an
overcharged flash-bulb was ex
ploded in his face.
At this point Howard Avery drop
ped from the top of the car,
wrenched the Axe from his hands,
passed it through several hands to
Loofbourow, Hill, and Bettman.
Loufbourow calmly tucked it under
his sweater and walked to the
camera car, got in and drove away.
FROM GET-AWAY CAR
TEAR GAS DROPPED
Just as the get-away car left,
Miller dropped the tear gas bomb.
Horner, fighting furiously, was
joined by the frosh guards, and they
swept Avery into the bank. In the
bomb confusion, Kropp and Miller
ransacked the car to make sure they
hadn't seized a fake.
Ferrino and his men blocked every
entrance to the vicinity, delaying any
messages which might be relayed to
the rest of the campus. Then the
rest of the men mixed with the crowd
and passed the word to "go up to
the Campanile and organize a pur
suit party to get the Axe back from
those Stanford men."
This second ruse delayed matters
materially and gave the Axe car a
chance to get away.
Back at Stanford, a wild im
promptu rally was staged. The
Daily put out an extra at 4 o'clock
in the morning, most of the staff
working in the (c pajamas. Tfne
crowd marched from the foot of the
Quad to Encina where the frosh
gleefully joined in, then they went
up the Row picking up most of the
fraternity and sorority inhabitants.

At the post office the fear of retalia
tory raids was expressed and so the
Axe was taken to Roble where Paul
Speegle led the yelling, and the
Roble women, who had all complete
ly forgotten lockouts, took the Axe
in for the night.
Newspapers all over the United
States carried stories of the fa
mous raid. The "21" chose to give
no one leader the credit, and all
laurels and honor were distributed
equally. The Palo Alto American
Trust vaults held the Axe for two
years, and then, in 1933, the col
orful weapon was put up as a
perpetual Big Game trophy.
Probably, if the Axe had not been
stolen, it would have been thrown
into a corner and forgotten. As it
happened, however, the Axe became
the burning symbol of the two
schools' rivalry a rivalry which
has existed since 1891 with only a
three-year lapse.
During 1915-16-17, the Big Game
was played against Santa Clara.
Both U.C. and Stanford had aban
doned American football in 1906,
but Cal chose to return to American
football three years before Stan
ford did. Santa Clara stuck to
rugby, and it is for that reason that
Stanford traditionally plays the
Broncos each season.

Strangest thing about the Stanford Axe is that, while it is the greatest
symbol of the Cal-Stanford rivalry, it, in itself, did more than any other
thing to create that rivalry; and the events surrounding its origin and
checkered history are credited by some authorities with having crystallized
both the Stanford and University of California spirits. .?
It all began back in '9l when Stanford first opened its gates. The
Berkeley Behemoth was settled in its ways with a good 30 years of

tradition under its belt. It had had,
no rivals for three decades, and
when the Palo Altans moved in
down on the Peninsula, it was only
natural that Cal should look down
her regal nose at the upstarts. Also
it was only natural that the Stan
fords should be the cocky little
fellows, resentful of their rivals'
superior attitude.
Events rolled along nicely until.
1899. Stanford had dropped only
one of- the Cal-Stanford baseball
series, even winning the very first
game, played in 1892. It had also
won thq first football game played
the same year, at the Haight Street
Grounds in San Francisco. Serpen
tine was used for the first time then
to decorate the San Francisco -
bound student trains. Cal was be
ginning to realize that the battle
for athletic supremacy was on.
YELL INTRODUCED
BY IRWIN IN '96
In 1896, Will Irwin, together with
Chris Bradley, had introduced the
Axe Yell. It could not have been
equaled as an expression of the
sentiment Stanford held for U.C.
All the bloody associations con
nected with axes touched the kin
dred feeling Stanford held for its
still superior rival.
Then in 1899 a black tragedy
hit the Farm. George Beckett,
captain of the baseball team and
star pitcher, died before the sea
son started. He couldn't be re
placed arid Stanford lost the first
game of the series. It looked as
though the "any-Stanford-man
is - worth two - Cal -men - any - time -
any-place" theory was in for a
nasty set-back.
Desperately the students sought a
way to rebuild team spirit. Out of
this search came the first Big Game
Bonfire and The Axe. At the bon
fire Frank English and Billy Erb,
yell leader in his off-season from
football, produced a huge ten-pound
axe and before a cheering throng
sharpened it to a razor edge. Then,
with the crowd at a fever pitch, they
cut off the head of a blue and gold
effigy with one blow.
ROOTERS TAKE AXE
TO BASEBALL GAME
The great red axe went with the
rooters to the baseball game in San
Francisco, and it was constantly in
evidence. But Stanford lost the
gahie and the series 9-7. Strangely,
it was Cal's place to make the Axe
a 33-year bone of contention. Some
University of California men hadn't
liked that axe and they determined
to take down the Stanford come
uppance a little by stealing it.
Meanwhile the despondent Billy
Erb had given the axe to Carl Hay
den (Hayden grew up to be a U.S.
Senator, but he was only a de
bater then), and he and two com
panions started off dragging the axe
behind them. Tom Mcfadden, 200-
pound Stanford tackle, heard some
Cal men planning the theft. Imme
diately the axe regained some of
its prestige, if only that it gave him
a chance to battle a few Berkeley
ites. He joined the other three and
they started warily off down the
street.
BERKELEY HORDE
FOLLOWS DEFENDERS
A growing horde of Cal men fol
lowed them. The four defenders
took a four-man grip on the prize,
and waited. Then began a fight
which raged over San Francisco for
six or seven hours. At first the melee
was general, then gradually four
radiating lines formed, each man
with his arms locked around the
man in front of him, and the four
Stanford men at the nucleus grim
ly hanging on to their axe.
It was natui-al that their grips
should evetnually break, but Mc-
Fadden managed to last the long
est. Among the Berkeleyites was a
football player, Paul Castlehun. He
is now Dr. Castlehun of San Fran
cisco. In an interview yesterday
he said:
"I heard somebody yell, 'Every
body grab a man, and somebody
gdl the axe!' The next thing I
knew I had it. I started to run,
with the idea of getting it home,
since I lived near there, but the
thing was too heavy."
With a howling mob after him,
unsure whether it was friend or foe
(a number of Stanford men had
joined the crowd by :then but they
were heavily outnumbered), he
threw the axe to Fondini Bacigalupi,
who, when he becam'e " exhausted,
relayed it to Bill Drumm.
HURDLER STARTS
TO RUN WITH AXE
In the mob was a Stanford hur
dler named Stout; watching his
chance he stuck with Drumm.
Drumm, also exhausted, unknow
ingly handed the prize over to him,
and then Stout started to run. Stan
ford would have recovered the axe
right then if littlp Jimmy Hopper,
Berkeley's wonder quarterback, had
not ..been among those present. He

brought down Stout with a very il
legal flying tackle, and recovered
the weapon. The battle then turned
into a triumphal march.
In the meantime Senator-to-be
Hayden had called the police saying
that a crowd' of U.C. students had
stolen a valuable souvenir in the
form of an axe, and were making
away with it in a stolen horse and
wagon. The chief wanted a descrip
tion of the horse and wagon but
Hayden howled back over the phone:
"To helj with the horse and
wagon. We want the axe!"
The captors had by this time
abandoned their commandeered
horse and wagon and taken the
street car. With them was Stan
ford's "Crazy Joe" Hamilton, biding
his time, He saw his chance in
Chinatown after the captors had cut
off the handle in a butcher shop.
In a letter written in 1930 to Dink
Temple ton he says:
"I forget whether the axe - was
stolen after the first or second time
I was fired, or after the first time I
flunked. But I had had six months'
newspaper work in San Francisco
and that helped, or rather it should
have helped but didn't. My detail
had been Chinatown, the red-light
district, and the morgue.
FAMILIAR GROUND
NEAR DUPONT STREET
"Consequently . . . near the top
of old Dupont Street ... I was on
familiar ground. But the thing that
has always puzzled me is that ap
parently they were too.
"However, I knew just what to
do. I dived in, grabbed as many legs
as I could, we came down in a bunch
and-1 hollered for the police hoping
that someone I knew would come
along. They punched me around a
bit and because I was still ob
streperous one of them kicked me in
the ribs for good measure. I looked
at him calmly and said, 'I will kill
you if I ever see you again'; he
bowed quite gracefully, they took
the axe. and went away, some of
them remaining a few moments
longer on my carcass discussing to
tally irrelevant things. Then they
also went and the police came.
"I knew a couple of cops, and
we raced for the Ferry. We be
gan arresting suspicious charac
ters till we had quite a huddle.
But we found no axe. It was get
ting late so the cops decided to
call it a day."
Dr. Castlehun was present among
those arrested. And according to
him, this is what happened. The
gang with the axe found the Ferry
building quite crowded with Stan
ford reinforcements and Mr. Ham
ilton's police. After a brief confer
ence it was decided that Cliff Miller,
the only man with an overcoat,
should hide it. Thinking fast, he
spied an unescorted coed, a nodding
acquaintance of his, offered her his
aim, and strolled into the building.
The coed has remained unidentified
to this day. The axe was taken to
Berkeley.
HAMILTON RECOGNIZES
BEAR ASSAILANT
Hamilton met his man that night
at dinner, with the Irwin brothers
and Billy Erb. He says, "... I was
sure I knew him but I couldn't
place the face . . . later it flashed
upon me that this was the man
who had engineered the job on
Dupont Street and had kicked me
in the slats. It seemed just a bit out
of place to attempt to carry out
my threat and I have never seen
him since. That man was Jimmy
Hopper."
