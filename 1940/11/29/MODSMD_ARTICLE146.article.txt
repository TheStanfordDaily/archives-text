# OLD FEUD RENEWED
## 
### 
An old feud will be renewed in
this year's Big Game when Right
Halfback Jim Jurkovich of Cali
fornia faces Fullback Milt Vucinich
of Stanford. In the Little Big Game
last year, Vucinich somewhat ruf
fled the Berkeley fireball with some
crushing tackles. He hopes to re
peat tomororw while Jurkovich will
equally be prepared for his old an
tagonist.
