# Two Stanford Men Complete 'West Point of Air' Course
## 
### 
Two former Stanford Flying Cadets, VV. N. Hite, ':>!), Arlington. Wash.,
and Frank 11. Beales, '40. Mountain View, Calif., are among the 2(i(i em
bryo pilots who completed the basic phase of their training course for
the Army Air Corps about Nov. 22. at Randolph Field. Texas, the "West
Point of the Air." The objective of the army program is to train officers

to pilot the objective 12,800 combat
planes of the Air Corps.
The Flying Cadets will transfer
to the advanced flying school at
Kelly Field. Texas, for a final ten
weeks' aerial training in formation
flying and cross-country navigation,
both day and night, before winning
their "wings" and shoulder bars as
second lieutenants in the Air Corps
Reserve.
The goal of the Air Corps is to
turn out 12,000 pilots annually to
man the 54 combat groups of the
G.11.Q. Air Force recently author
ized. Expansion of the Air Corps
ground forces to 163,000 men will
be required to keep the aerial arm
of the army operating at full tactical
strength.
SKY DEFENSE
Twelve thousand eight hundred
combat planes of all types, light,
medium, and heavy bombardment,
interceptor, and fighter pursuit, as
well as medium and long range re
conaissance aviation, will be em
ployed to erect invincible and im
pregnable barriers for sky defense.
This ninth class of Flying Cadets
to complete basic training under the
expansion program of the Air Corps
started their primary training last
July. Numerous flying schools lo
cated at strategic centers through
out the country are utilized by the
Air Corps for this phase.
At these schools they spent 10
weeks learning the fundamentals of
pilotage on rugged 200-horsepower
army biplanes. Each Flying Cadet
logged about 65 hours flying time,
about half of it solo. All aerial ma
neuvers from landings and take-offs
to loops and snap rolls were mas
tered.
ASSEMBLE AT RANDOLPH
In September all were assembled
at Randolph Field, the Air Corps'
giant flight training school in south
Texas, for their basic flight training.
The Flying Cadets stepped from
their low-powered primary training
planes into 450-horsepower low
wing basic trainers, with 150-mile
an-hour cruising speed.
Seventy - five additional flying
hours have been acquired on this

ype craft, which embodies many
)f the features of a 1941 combat
ilane. They got their first taste of
light flying, making take-offs and
anding in the darkness, aided by
he glare of huge flood lights. In
strument or "blind flying" has been
ncluded in their course of training
at Randolph Field.
TNAL STEP AHEAD
Ahead of them lies the final step
n the transformation of a young
college man into a full-fledged mil
tary pilot. At Kelly Field they will
ly even speedier planes on naviga
tion flights Several hundred miles
n extent. Three-plane formations
vvill gradually be built up to six
ind then twelve-plane groups, each
:raft manned by a Flying Cadet.
At graduation, scheduled for
some time early in January, they
will receive their "wings," emblem
of military pilots, and will be ready
for service on combat squadrons of
;he rapidly expanding Air Corps.
During the 30-week training pe
riod. Flying Cadets are paid $75 per
month in addition to their uniforms,
food, and clothing. When commis
sioned their pay is increased to $205
a month. • ■

TNAL STEP AHEAD
Ahead of them lies the final step
n the transformation of a young
college man into a full-fledged mil
tary pilot. At Kelly Field they will
ly even speedier planes on naviga
tion flights Several hundred miles

vvill gradually be built up to six

At graduation, scheduled for
some time early in January, they
will receive their "wings," emblem

for service on combat squadrons of

Two former Stanford Flying Cadets, VV. N. Hite, ':>!), Arlington. Wash.,
and Frank 11. Beales, '40. Mountain View, Calif., are among the 2(i(i em
bryo pilots who completed the basic phase of their training course for
the Army Air Corps about Nov. 22. at Randolph Field. Texas, the "West
Point of the Air." The objective of the army program is to train officers

to pilot the objective 12,800 combat
planes of the Air Corps.
The Flying Cadets will transfer
to the advanced flying school at
Kelly Field. Texas, for a final ten
weeks' aerial training in formation
flying and cross-country navigation,
both day and night, before winning
their "wings" and shoulder bars as
second lieutenants in the Air Corps
Reserve.
The goal of the Air Corps is to
turn out 12,000 pilots annually to
man the 54 combat groups of the
G.11.Q. Air Force recently author
ized. Expansion of the Air Corps
ground forces to 163,000 men will
be required to keep the aerial arm
of the army operating at full tactical
strength.
SKY DEFENSE
Twelve thousand eight hundred
combat planes of all types, light,
medium, and heavy bombardment,
interceptor, and fighter pursuit, as
well as medium and long range re
conaissance aviation, will be em
ployed to erect invincible and im
pregnable barriers for sky defense.
This ninth class of Flying Cadets
to complete basic training under the
expansion program of the Air Corps
started their primary training last
July. Numerous flying schools lo
cated at strategic centers through
out the country are utilized by the
Air Corps for this phase.
At these schools they spent 10
weeks learning the fundamentals of
pilotage on rugged 200-horsepower
army biplanes. Each Flying Cadet
logged about 65 hours flying time,
about half of it solo. All aerial ma
neuvers from landings and take-offs
to loops and snap rolls were mas
tered.
ASSEMBLE AT RANDOLPH
In September all were assembled
at Randolph Field, the Air Corps'
giant flight training school in south
Texas, for their basic flight training.
The Flying Cadets stepped from
their low-powered primary training
planes into 450-horsepower low
wing basic trainers, with 150-mile
an-hour cruising speed.
Seventy - five additional flying
hours have been acquired on this

ype craft, which embodies many
)f the features of a 1941 combat
ilane. They got their first taste of
light flying, making take-offs and
anding in the darkness, aided by
