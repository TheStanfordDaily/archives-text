# Vegetable Man 'Squashes' Cal, 13-0
## 
### 
If the vegetable man has anything
to say about it, Stanford is going to
"squash" California come tomorrow
afternoon. A concrete proof of his
faith in the Indian team rests in the
office of Miss Christine Ricker, di
rector of dining halls.
One of the truck farmers who sup
plies the dining halls with vegetables
inscribed these words in a growing
squash six months ago: California 0â€”
Stanford 13. As the squash devel
oped, scar tissue formed the inscrip
tion perfectly. He recently presented
the finished product showing his
prediction to Miss Ricker.
The squash, which is slightly
larger than a football, may be used
in decorating the team's training
table tonight. Only thing holding
them back is the fear that the grid
ders may hold the score down to
conform with the vegetable man's
prophecy.
