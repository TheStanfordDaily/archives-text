# HOOVER WAR LIBE NEARS COMPLETION
## 
### 
If building is any indication, the depression is over.
On the campus, and in Paly, building is moving along rapidly on johs
of all sorts. The only trouble is they are all going to be finished by
December, and then the curious will have nothing to gtfwk at for a long
time to come.
Work on the Hoover War Library is rapidly ncaring completion, and
110 longer can men be seen crawling like ants up and down the sides. The
scaffolding is all off, and work is now ....

being pushed forward on the inside.
According to the foreman, there
is no truth to the rumor that the
scaffolding was removed with un
seemly haste because of the fear
that the Cal students would mount
it and adorn the sides with large
C's.
Work on the overpass on U.S. 101
will be finished in six weeks, ac
cording to Foreman L. P. Jones. At
present there are four structures
sticking up somewhat precariously,
it seems, but eventually they Will
form the main supports for the road
into Paly.
Huge machines are laying con
crete at the rate of 380 cubic yards

a day for the new highway, and that
part of the work will be finished
shortly.
Moving on down the road a
stretch, work on the underpass into
Palo Alto is taking shape rapidly,
a.s is the town's swanky new sta
tion.
Asked how soon the job would
be finished, G. W. Thompson, resi
dent engineer, said:
"Tell me what the weather will
be like and I'll tell you how soon
we will finish."
Thompson thought, however, that
the job would be completed by
January 1.
