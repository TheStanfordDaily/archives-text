Hears is that they will have a battle
on thpir hands but that they are
fully capable of winning tomorrow's
45th Big Game.
The Indians' husky fullback and
candidate for Ail-American honors,
Captain Norm Standlee, figures:
"They are bound to be tough— Cal
always is: but I feel that we have
the stuff to beat them."
ALBERT OPTIMISTIC
A little more optimistic was
Franki© Albert, Coach Clark
Shaughnessy's brilliant little field
general, punter, and passer de luxe.
Frankie said, "If we get off to a
good start and score in the first
quarter, we can take them by as
many as lour touchdowns."
Lanky Freddie Meyer, Stanford's
able fh'.nkman and the talented re
ceiver who makes many of Albert's
passes pay oft, was also confident of
victory. "With the breaks, we can
turn them back by three touch
downs," commented Fred when he
war: quizzed.
The Cards' two scrappy sopho
more ilnemari, Bruno Banducci and
Chuck Taylor, tackle and guard, re
spectively. were not flowery but
rather emphatic in their opinion. All
they had to say was, "We can take
'cm!"
PALMER LIKES SPIRIT
Big, powerful, and good looking
Dick Palmer, Stanford's defensive
signal caller who is always turning
up at. the right time to make tackles
Irom his line-backing spot, felt that

"the fight of the team and the spirit
of the rooting section will help us
beat Cal."
Ed "Truck" Stamm, the promis
ing sophomore, and Stan Graff, End
Coach Jim Lawson's veteran wing
man, both stated that Cal was going
to be tough because of the terrific
spirit generated by a Big Game.
They opined, 'Cal, no matter their
seasonal record, is always fired to
new heights by the spirit of the Big
Game."
All in all the mental attitude of
of the players seems ideal. They feel
confident that they have an expert
coaching staff handling them, a fiery
l'ooting section behind them, and the
ability to dump the Bears.
But they aren't overconfident and
are fully aware that tomorrow's is
the one and only Big Game and that

Game."
All in all the mental attitude of
of the players seems ideal. They feel
confident that they have an expert
coaching staff handling them, a fiery
l'ooting section behind them, and the
ability to dump the Bears.
But they aren't overconfident and
are fully aware that tomorrow's is
the one and only Big Game and that
they will have an inspired oppo
nent which will turn in its best
game of the year.
The general consensus of those
Stanford gridders who will wear
the Cardinal and White in action to
moirow against Berkeley's battling
Hears is that they will have a battle
on thpir hands but that they are
fully capable of winning tomorrow's
45th Big Game.
The Indians' husky fullback and
candidate for Ail-American honors,
Captain Norm Standlee, figures:
"They are bound to be tough— Cal
always is: but I feel that we have
the stuff to beat them."
ALBERT OPTIMISTIC
A little more optimistic was
Franki© Albert, Coach Clark
Shaughnessy's brilliant little field
general, punter, and passer de luxe.
Frankie said, "If we get off to a
good start and score in the first
quarter, we can take them by as
many as lour touchdowns."
Lanky Freddie Meyer, Stanford's
able fh'.nkman and the talented re
ceiver who makes many of Albert's
passes pay oft, was also confident of
victory. "With the breaks, we can
turn them back by three touch
downs," commented Fred when he
war: quizzed.
The Cards' two scrappy sopho
more ilnemari, Bruno Banducci and
Chuck Taylor, tackle and guard, re
spectively. were not flowery but
rather emphatic in their opinion. All
they had to say was, "We can take
'cm!"
PALMER LIKES SPIRIT
Big, powerful, and good looking
Dick Palmer, Stanford's defensive
signal caller who is always turning
up at. the right time to make tackles
Irom his line-backing spot, felt that

"the fight of the team and the spirit
of the rooting section will help us
beat Cal."
Ed "Truck" Stamm, the promis
ing sophomore, and Stan Graff, End
Coach Jim Lawson's veteran wing
man, both stated that Cal was going
to be tough because of the terrific
spirit generated by a Big Game.
They opined, 'Cal, no matter their
seasonal record, is always fired to
new heights by the spirit of the Big
Game."
