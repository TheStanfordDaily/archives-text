### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 28 (UP).â€”
A 2,500-page Federal Bureau of In
vestigation report on Harry Bridges
was sent to the Justice Department
today for study to determine whether
the facts warrant deportation pro
ceedings against the West Coast. CIO
leader.
Attorney General Robert H. Jack
son said that the report, sent to him
by Chief G-man J. Edgar Hoover,
is "confidential and purely factual
in character" and presents no recom
mendations.
The FBI investigation of Bridges
started Aug. 24 when Jackson or
dered the case reopened in view of
the newly-enacted alien registration
law, under which Bridges would be
deportable should he be found to
have been a member of any organi
zation advocating overthrow of the
government by force.
Deportation proceedings which
previously had been brought against
Bridges were dropped when Harvard
Law School Detm James Landis re
ported that the Australian-born
leader of the West Coast maritime
unions was not a member of such an
organization when a previous de
portation warrant was issued.
