### 
MEXICO CITY, Nov. 2S (I I*). â€”Henry A. Wallace's triumphal 750-
milc trip from the United Stales border to Mexico City was marred tonight
by a wild anti-American demonstration outside the United States Em -
hassy. Police were forced to disperse the yelling crowd with drawn pistols
and tear gas bombs.
The crowd, estimated at UOO to 700 women, children and students, had
gathered in a nearby street as a result of handbills which warned them
ihat Mexico's sovereignty was in*

danger.
At a given moment the crowd
lushed into the square and tried to
crosh the Chancery's doors but the
attendants slammed them shut in
time.
DOWN WITH GRINGOS!
The milling crowd then began to
shout "Viva Almazan!" and "Down
with the Gringos!"
Missiles were thrown at the Chan
cery and anti-American handbills
were tossed into the air.
Almazan is General Juan An
dreu Almazan, defeated in the pres
idential election last July. Upon his
return here from the United States
early this week he said he had aban
dond his claim as "legally elected"
President of Mexico because ihe
U.S. government had chosen to back
the administration candidate. Gen
eral Manuel Avila Camacho. Wal
lace was sent here to be the official
U.S. representative at Avila Ca
macho's inauguration Dec. 1.
WALLACE MISSES RIOT
Wallace did not see the demon
stration when he arrived at the Em
bassy residence, which is situated
around the corner from the Chan
cery. He and his party, which in
cluded Ambassador Josephus Dan
iels, and the Mexican Ambassador
to Washington, Dr. Francisco Cas
tillo Najera, therefore did not en
counter any personal incidents.
The majority of the Embassy stal T
were in the buildings or on the
sidewalks watching the crowd, but
the military attache, Colonel Gor
don McCoy, who had accompanied
Wallace on his trip from the border,
was hit in the jaw as he left his
car and tried to shoulder his way
through the crowd. He did not sus
tain any injury.
Twenty minutes after Wallace's
arrival order had been restored and
Ihe square cleared. Motorcycle po
lice then tsablished a cordon around
the Chan - / building.
