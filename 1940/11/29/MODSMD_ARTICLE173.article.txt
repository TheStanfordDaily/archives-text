# Bear Roasting Continues After 48-Year Precedent
## 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
Stanford undergraduates held a
mass meeting last night to carry
out their most sacred duty.
lhc> were busy about their lethal
business of cremating the lowly
Golden Bear on the torture grill of
Stanford's Fiftieth Year Big Game
Bonfire.
Scattered about the outer edges of
the funeral pyre were a few old
timers, clustered in little groups
here and there.
It was as if they were watching
over the bloodthirsty scene from a
distance of perspective in the shad
ows of Stanford's past.
They must have recalled the in
fant days back in '92 when the In
dians first roasted the Bear, estab
lishing a Bonfire tradition that has
been carried out as a duty and a
privilege to today.
TROLLEY DERAILED
Ask some of the boys like Ser
jeant Tom Casey about the time
they derailed the old Toonerville
trolley that used to run from Paly
to the campus, broke it up with dis
patch, and piled it on the blaze. That
was in '29.
It was all right, though, because
the practically defunct street car
company announced they didn't
want it anyway. Service was dis
continued.
Advancing history to the year of
33, they say it wasn't necessary to
cremate the fuzzy creature from up
north; the grid squad took care of
that angle to the tune of 7 to 3. And
anyway, that year attention was
centered on the lynching of two
slayers who were snached from the
county jail by a mob of 20,000 down
in San Jose.
CAL PLOT FOILED
Then came '35, the year U.C.'s
hopes symbolically went up in
smoke at a bonfire which attracted
10,000 frenzied rooters. The Bear
was annihilated 13-0. That year
the Axe was on hand for the first
time at any rally; "Doodles" Wea
ver, ex-Farm funny man, was.in his
prime; and a new song was writ
ten. "Get on the Big Red Toboggan,"
to the tune of "Put on Your Old
Gray Bonnet."
CAL PLOTS
In .'!G Cal plotted to set off the Big
Game pyre prematurely, and
stopped at nothing short of an in
cendiary bomb, concealed in the
pile of material that formed the
Bonfire. However, the plot was
foiled when Philip Kellerman and
Douglas Bryan laid just claims to
immortality by discovering the in
let rial machine before it exploded.
This was the year the Stanford
women rated "Jeemy" Coffis the
ladies favorite on the grid squad.
In ":58 Roble women continued the
tradition by serving lunches to the
Bonfire workers, and the pile rose
just as high and burned as brightly
as ever before, only the Cal men
managed to beat the Indians (5-0
BEARMEN EARLY
And in '39 and again this year the
Bear was early to his own funeral.
He waxed over-anxious, and came
down a day early to burn what
litlle wood had already been accum
ulated by Encinamen.
