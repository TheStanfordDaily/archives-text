# Pre-Game Rally Lifts Rafters
## Stanford Goes Wild In Jammed Pavilion 
### 
Over 4,000 Stanfordites and towns
people packed the bleachers, jammed
the floor, and filled every inch of
standing room last night in the Pa
vilion for the noisiest, maddest Big
Game Rally since Stanford started
sending 11 men across the Bay.
There was no need to generate the
spirit—the electricity was there.
And then the spark—they brought
in the Bear's Big Black Bier—it
was a madhouse all over again.
Quiet for a minute—and again the
Pavilion shook as the Varsity and
Coach Clark Shaughnessy climbed
the platform.
SPEAKERS EXCITE
The feet - pounding, whistling,
yelling crowd was brought to its
feet by a procession of speakers
telling why Stanford will beat Cal.
Paying his respects to what he
termed "the greatest coaching staff
and team in America," Frank Fish
Walker told of his exile in New
York for the past 20 years. "I have
seen the best teams in the East and
the Middle West, including Notre
Dame's Four Horsemen, but I say
to you if any of them played Stan
lord Saturday, I'd choose Stanford
to win," he exclaimed.
LEISER TALKS
Bill Leiser, San Francisco sports
editor, truthfully pointed out that no
pep talk was needed, for Stanford
can beat the devil out of Cal anyway.
Leiser introduced the first surprise
of the evening—Will Aubrey, radio
and stage entertainer, who sang an
original Russian hill-billy song,
"Where the Vodka River Flows."
Enemy-camp representative, Cal
Student President John McPherson,
congratulated the coach and team,
but booes and hisses followed his
remark, "This coming Saturday you
will meet up with the best team on
the Coast."
COIiBUS ORATES
And the man who knows Card
football, Stanford's All - American
Bill Corbus. declared there has never
been a Stanford team showing as
much never-die spirit as this. "The
Cal game is a season in itself, and.
although we've got a tough job on
our hands, Stanford will rise to
win."
Pandemonium rose to a new height
when Coach Shaughnessy took the
mike saying, "After the heart-warm
ing greeting I received last spring
when I met the student body the
first time, I was left with a deter
mination io do my best for a school
that loves football and sports."
The crowd told him he had.
Speaking of the next game. Coach
Shaughnessy confided that he knows
the boys will finish the job—"And
you know what I mean by that," he
concluded.
Surprise No. 2 of the evening was
Aubrey Austin, who delivered a
stirring address while the band
drowned him out with "Here Comes
—And by request of all, the
local favorite, Sergeant Tommy Ca
sey, appeared, and everybody would
have been in the aisles—except they
were filled.
Bright red stockings were pre
sented to the hard-working Gordy
Nicoll; float winners were named;
a new clapping yell was introduced,
and the Stanford Glee Club pre
sented two new songs—the Rally was
about over. Except for the highlight,
the last, and the best—the Axe Yell.
