SMITH IS BUTLER
"Family Album," the V-j.utain
, raiser, is a Victorian coinedly in
j one scene. A neat touch is the •
jot' background music in the sketch
| The use is particularly effective iVi
{ a lively, staccato piece of music
! played whenever C. Aubrey Smith,
as the old family butler, makes his
| entrances. At the sound of the
i music, the whol? audience was
craning its collective neck expec
tantly. In a group of excellent ac
i tors, Miss Joan Fontaine was a
j standout both for her beauty and
i ability.
The only real lag in the whole
} evening occurred during the presen
tation of "Ways and Means." This
! sketch was just a bit thinner than
; the other two, both as to mood and
j characters. Brian Aherne and Be
nita Hume did their best to gag
through the two scenes and the di
rector co-operated with any number
iof .stage devices . . . but, there
was that lag!
GARDINER EXCELS
Surprise of the evening occurred
' when the traditionally demure
| Heather Angel appeared in "Fumed
Oak" as the gangly, awkward ado
| lescent with adenoids. Reginald
Gardiner as the oppressed, meek
husband who, in the second scene,
1 stages a violent rebellion against
his despicable family life was really
| magnificent.
If the British are relieved by the
' performances as much as the Amer
j icans are entertained, the Players'
Theater has killed the proverbial
two birds.—Mullany

"Family Album," the V-j.utain
, raiser, is a Victorian coinedly in
j one scene. A neat touch is the •
jot' background music in the sketch
| The use is particularly effective iVi
{ a lively, staccato piece of music
! played whenever C. Aubrey Smith,
as the old family butler, makes his
| entrances. At the sound of the
i music, the whol? audience was
craning its collective neck expec
tantly. In a group of excellent ac
i tors, Miss Joan Fontaine was a
j standout both for her beauty and
i ability.
The only real lag in the whole
} evening occurred during the presen
tation of "Ways and Means." This
! sketch was just a bit thinner than
; the other two, both as to mood and
j characters. Brian Aherne and Be
nita Hume did their best to gag
through the two scenes and the di
rector co-operated with any number
iof .stage devices . . . but, there
was that lag!
GARDINER EXCELS
Surprise of the evening occurred

Oak" as the gangly, awkward ado

Gardiner as the oppressed, meek
husband who, in the second scene,
1 stages a violent rebellion against
his despicable family life was really

If the British are relieved by the
