# Dies Labelled Feature Hound
## House Urged to Pass Fifth Column Laws 
### 
WASHINGTON. Nov. 28 (UP).-
Chairman Martin Dies of the House
Committee on Un-American Activi
sts, was labeled a "publicity seek
r" by Rep. Samuel Dickstein, D..
N. Y., who urged the House to dis
continue the committee next year
,nd substitute rigid anti-fifth col
umn legislation.
Dickstein's blast came as Dies was
en route from his Orange, Texas,
home for a White House conference
tomorrow to discuss coordination of
the Government's anti-sabotage and
anti-espionage work.
PUBLISHES DOCUMENTS
During the past week, the Dies
Committee has published two docu
ments —a"white paper" on German
propaganda activities in this coun
try and a "red book" designed to
refute the U. S. Communist Party's
claim that it is free of Moscow
domination. Between times, Dies
has criticized Justice Department
and Federal Bureau of Investigation
methods.
Yesterday President Roosevelt
warned him against interfering with
functions of executive departments.
ATTACK SHAMEFUL
"Any attack by Dies or any mem
ber of his committee on the De
partment of Justice is shameful and
disgraceful," Dicks t e in said. "I
would not exchange one G-man for
all the investigators that Dies has
had on his political payroll."
He said the "white paper" con
tained "not a bit of evidence" that
would lead to the indictment or
conviction of anyone.
Dickstein exhibited a copy of
Dies' recent book — The Trojan
Horse in America—and said "If you
want to know anything about this
investigation, you've got to buy a
' book for $2.50."
