THAT six-day period of insanity that culmi- i
nates in the Big Game—and is followed by
a black Sunday—reached crescendo heights
last night at the Pavilion and the lake.
To Encina and Roble, it's all a new story.
And to the rest of us it's a more familiar but
never tiresome one. Every, year the moist
bored senior is soundly rocked by the terrific
spirit that is generated by Big Game Week.
It's impossible to sit through a period of such j
frenzy and not be touched by it.
The boiling turmoil of Thursday night will |
bubble into Memorial Stadium in Berkeley to- !
morrow. It will be in the crammed bleachers i
where alumni watch their university's team. It |
will be in the rooting section where four thou
sand Farm undergraduates wil be screaming ;
for the Axe.
And it will be on the field where an unbeat
able Stanford squad will face its forty-five year
rival.
Big Game time knows no adequate descrip
tive adjectives. The whole show is something
that Barnum or DeMille or Billy Rose couldn't
manufacture. And to someone outside that j
charmed circle of Stanford or Cal men and j
women, it cannot bring the same lift, the same ;
sudden quickening of the pulse, the same thrill i
along the spine.
The hard, gruelling work with Coach Clark ;
ohaughnessy, under the arc lights, on the
greensward; afternoons full of drill, chalk talks,
dinners at training table, between-halves par- j
leys—all the long parade of autumn quarter j
days—these things are ended for the Stanford
varsity.
The results of those hours of work, eloquently
told on eight Saturday afternoons, are part of :
the record.
Tomorrow afternoon the "rags to riches boys" j
will make their drive to cinch a spot among the
immortals of Stanford grid history. No one on
the Farm doubts the outcome of tomorrow's !
final effort. The dividends already have been
big.
The chant from the stands will be strong,
clear, and confident—because it will be a vic
tory chant.

manufacture. And to someone outside that j
charmed circle of Stanford or Cal men and j
women, it cannot bring the same lift, the same ;
sudden quickening of the pulse, the same thrill i
along the spine.
The hard, gruelling work with Coach Clark ;
ohaughnessy, under the arc lights, on the
greensward; afternoons full of drill, chalk talks,
dinners at training table, between-halves par- j
leys—all the long parade of autumn quarter j
days—these things are ended for the Stanford
varsity.
The results of those hours of work, eloquently
told on eight Saturday afternoons, are part of :
the record.
Tomorrow afternoon the "rags to riches boys" j
will make their drive to cinch a spot among the
immortals of Stanford grid history. No one on
the Farm doubts the outcome of tomorrow's !
final effort. The dividends already have been
big.
The chant from the stands will be strong,
clear, and confident—because it will be a vic
tory chant.
THAT six-day period of insanity that culmi- i
nates in the Big Game—and is followed by
a black Sunday—reached crescendo heights
last night at the Pavilion and the lake.
To Encina and Roble, it's all a new story.
And to the rest of us it's a more familiar but
never tiresome one. Every, year the moist
bored senior is soundly rocked by the terrific
spirit that is generated by Big Game Week.
It's impossible to sit through a period of such j
frenzy and not be touched by it.
The boiling turmoil of Thursday night will |
bubble into Memorial Stadium in Berkeley to- !
morrow. It will be in the crammed bleachers i
where alumni watch their university's team. It |
will be in the rooting section where four thou
sand Farm undergraduates wil be screaming ;
for the Axe.
And it will be on the field where an unbeat
able Stanford squad will face its forty-five year
rival.
Big Game time knows no adequate descrip
tive adjectives. The whole show is something
that Barnum or DeMille or Billy Rose couldn't
manufacture. And to someone outside that j
charmed circle of Stanford or Cal men and j
women, it cannot bring the same lift, the same ;
sudden quickening of the pulse, the same thrill i
along the spine.
