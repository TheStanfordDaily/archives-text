# Death of a Crusader
## 
### 
THE recent appointment of Senator George of
Georgia as chairman of the Senate's foreign
relations committee marked the last step in the
passing from the public scene of one of the
most colorful figures Washington congressional
circles has ever seen.
Senator Key Pittman of Nevada, who died
early this month, first went to the upper body
of Congress in 1912. He stayed there continu
ously for 28 years until his death, which came
five days after he had been elected to the Sen
ate for his fifth term.
In these days of professional politicians, a
figure like Pittman was a refreshing sight in
America's legislative body. By affiliation he
was a Democrat, but actually he supported
whatever measure he considered most appro
priate, no matter which political party had
originated it.
He favored many phases of the New Deal,
disliked others. He spoke and thought articu
lately no matter which side of the fence he was
on.
After graduating from a small southern min
isterial college in 1890, Pittman could not resist
the lure of adventure. Soon after his gradua
tion he invested money in a land boom in the
state of Washington. The speculation collapsed
and Pittman was forced to become a lumber
camp logger in order to save enough money to
study law.
After being admitted to bar in Seattle at the
age of 20 he lost everything in another depres
sion. To recoup his losses he headed for the
Klondike at first reports of the gold rush.
After prospecting for a few months he became
Nome's first district attorney, organized the com
munity's so-called "consent" government,
helped dislodge unscrupulous city officials.
But the lure for riches and excitement were
too much for Pittman. When he heard word of
the silver strike at Tonopah, Nevada, he rushed
to the States again. Friends from Alaska pushed
him into politics and law in Nevada, where in
1910 he was defeated for the Senate. But his
opponent died and Pittman was appointed to the
unexpired term. Thereafter he war. elected

regularly, ascending to the chairmanship of the
foreign relations committee upon the death of
Senator William E. Borah, another colorful old
timer.
Pittman, a man of strong likes and dislikes,
was outspoken in his thoughts. The State De
partment was at one time afraid that the Ne
vada solon might precipitate an international in
cident when he said bluntly for publication:
"American people do not like Hitler."
He was against armed intervention in Europe,
believing that financial sanctions would hand
cuff international outlawry.
There are only a handful of veterans of Pitt
man's ilk left in Washington, Senator Norris of
Nebraska, for instance. But perhaps America
needs such men now.
Men who lived hard, fought hard, but thought
clearly.
Men who had the courage of their convictions,
and whose convictions were usually right.—

After being admitted to bar in Seattle at the
age of 20 he lost everything in another depres
sion. To recoup his losses he headed for the
Klondike at first reports of the gold rush.
After prospecting for a few months he became
Nome's first district attorney, organized the com
munity's so-called "consent" government,
helped dislodge unscrupulous city officials.
But the lure for riches and excitement were
too much for Pittman. When he heard word of
the silver strike at Tonopah, Nevada, he rushed
to the States again. Friends from Alaska pushed
him into politics and law in Nevada, where in
1910 he was defeated for the Senate. But his
opponent died and Pittman was appointed to the
unexpired term. Thereafter he war. elected

regularly, ascending to the chairmanship of the
foreign relations committee upon the death of
Senator William E. Borah, another colorful old
timer.
Pittman, a man of strong likes and dislikes,
was outspoken in his thoughts. The State De
partment was at one time afraid that the Ne
vada solon might precipitate an international in
cident when he said bluntly for publication:
"American people do not like Hitler."
He was against armed intervention in Europe,
believing that financial sanctions would hand
cuff international outlawry.
There are only a handful of veterans of Pitt
man's ilk left in Washington, Senator Norris of
Nebraska, for instance. But perhaps America
needs such men now.
Men who lived hard, fought hard, but thought
clearly.
Men who had the courage of their convictions,
and whose convictions were usually right.—

THE recent appointment of Senator George of
Georgia as chairman of the Senate's foreign
relations committee marked the last step in the
passing from the public scene of one of the
most colorful figures Washington congressional
circles has ever seen.
Senator Key Pittman of Nevada, who died
early this month, first went to the upper body
of Congress in 1912. He stayed there continu
ously for 28 years until his death, which came
five days after he had been elected to the Sen
ate for his fifth term.
In these days of professional politicians, a
figure like Pittman was a refreshing sight in
America's legislative body. By affiliation he
was a Democrat, but actually he supported
whatever measure he considered most appro
priate, no matter which political party had
originated it.
He favored many phases of the New Deal,
disliked others. He spoke and thought articu
lately no matter which side of the fence he was
on.
After graduating from a small southern min
isterial college in 1890, Pittman could not resist
the lure of adventure. Soon after his gradua
tion he invested money in a land boom in the
state of Washington. The speculation collapsed
and Pittman was forced to become a lumber
camp logger in order to save enough money to
study law.
