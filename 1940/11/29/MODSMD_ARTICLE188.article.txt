DOWN THE ROAD A PIECE
WAITH these words on this back page, The Daily
winds up its Autumn quarter effort for the year
1940.
So finish your scrambled eggs, or coffee, or your
eight o'clock, give this copy the once-over lightly, and
then forget about us until next quarter.
But, before you leave, here are a few bits of in
formation which may or may not prove of some in
terest and of some benefit to a good many.
As you probably have heard whispered around by a
few people, there is talk of our going to the Rose
Bowl this year. Honest. And since the Rose Bowl is
in Pasadena, by a cool,, collected process of logic that
means that you will at some time have to go to Pasa
dena if you are going to the game. So here, right from
the sunny south, right from Pasadena, come these few
tips.
•i* ■» *
getting to the game: the traffic starts around
7 o'clock in the morning Rose Bowl day. That is
no exaggeration. So if you are coming any great dis
tance from out of town, you had better start bright
and early. It just can't be put into words the way
those roads clog up with cars.
If yftu are approaching Pasadena from the wester
ly side, from Los Angeles or from Hollywood let us
say, then make an effort to stay off Colorado Boule
vard. This main road bottlenecks over the Colorado
Street bridge—suicide bridge—fights the Rose Parade
traffic, and in general is the most congested of the
lead-in highways.
Your best approach would be from a southerly
direction, or, better yet, from the east. Keep your
car guided so you can swing in from that side. If you
are coming from downtown Los Angeles, however, you
can pick up a new 45 mile-an-hour super highway
(to Pasadena) just off of Figueroa Street.
j(: * * jfc
Vf/HEN you get doton in the gulch holding the Rose
Bowl try to park in the south of the two parking
lots. The north lot is off all good lead-out roads, and
you will have to cross the south lot anyway in your
way out of the gulch. So save time this way.
As to living conditions in Pasadena, well, they
aren't so good. The hotels are all slanted for an
elderly patronage and their prices run higher than a
Four Roses salesman. There are no flop houses, no
good auto courts, and not much good of anything to
live in. So it would be best for you out-of-towners
to park the grips either in Los Angeles proper or to
find a pal who lives in Pasadena some time between
now and vacation time.
♦ ♦ ♦
As a whole the eating conditions in Pasadena are
pretty poor. The best drive-in is the Rite Spot, which
serves good food a mile west of the Colorado Street
bridge. Another drive-in is the G. and L. in down
town Pasadena. The car girls are better here.
These sort of places are your best place to pick up
a quick lunch on the run Rose Bowl day.
If you want a complete meal, well, for example,
there's the little Fiench restaurant in downtown Pasa
dena, or you might give the little Patio restaurant on
California Street a try. These places are swell for
dates and inexpensive.
As to bars—l his is a real tip—they are scarcer than
people under 50 years of age in Pasadena.
* #• Xt *
So, so long for now. A very Merry Christmas, a
marry-her New Year's Eve, and see you in the Rose
Bowl.

eight o'clock, give this copy the once-over lightly, and
then forget about us until next quarter.
But, before you leave, here are a few bits of in
formation which may or may not prove of some in
terest and of some benefit to a good many.
As you probably have heard whispered around by a
few people, there is talk of our going to the Rose
Bowl this year. Honest. And since the Rose Bowl is
in Pasadena, by a cool,, collected process of logic that
means that you will at some time have to go to Pasa
dena if you are going to the game. So here, right from
the sunny south, right from Pasadena, come these few
tips.
•i* ■» *
getting to the game: the traffic starts around
7 o'clock in the morning Rose Bowl day. That is
no exaggeration. So if you are coming any great dis
tance from out of town, you had better start bright
and early. It just can't be put into words the way
those roads clog up with cars.
If yftu are approaching Pasadena from the wester
ly side, from Los Angeles or from Hollywood let us
say, then make an effort to stay off Colorado Boule
vard. This main road bottlenecks over the Colorado
Street bridge—suicide bridge—fights the Rose Parade
traffic, and in general is the most congested of the
lead-in highways.
Your best approach would be from a southerly
direction, or, better yet, from the east. Keep your
car guided so you can swing in from that side. If you
are coming from downtown Los Angeles, however, you
can pick up a new 45 mile-an-hour super highway
(to Pasadena) just off of Figueroa Street.
j(: * * jfc
Vf/HEN you get doton in the gulch holding the Rose
Bowl try to park in the south of the two parking
lots. The north lot is off all good lead-out roads, and
you will have to cross the south lot anyway in your
way out of the gulch. So save time this way.
As to living conditions in Pasadena, well, they
aren't so good. The hotels are all slanted for an
elderly patronage and their prices run higher than a
Four Roses salesman. There are no flop houses, no
good auto courts, and not much good of anything to
live in. So it would be best for you out-of-towners
to park the grips either in Los Angeles proper or to
find a pal who lives in Pasadena some time between
now and vacation time.
♦ ♦ ♦
As a whole the eating conditions in Pasadena are
pretty poor. The best drive-in is the Rite Spot, which
serves good food a mile west of the Colorado Street
bridge. Another drive-in is the G. and L. in down
town Pasadena. The car girls are better here.
These sort of places are your best place to pick up
a quick lunch on the run Rose Bowl day.
If you want a complete meal, well, for example,
there's the little Fiench restaurant in downtown Pasa
dena, or you might give the little Patio restaurant on
California Street a try. These places are swell for
dates and inexpensive.
As to bars—l his is a real tip—they are scarcer than
people under 50 years of age in Pasadena.
* #• Xt *
So, so long for now. A very Merry Christmas, a
marry-her New Year's Eve, and see you in the Rose
Bowl.
