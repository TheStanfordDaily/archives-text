IN RE E. G. E.
r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
May I address E. G. E. whose letter appeared in
these columns several days ago?
You, E. G. E.. say slurringly, in your own small,
smug, semi»sophisticated way that the main reason
Stanford men and women arc ignoring outside events
is because of their well-bred, smug, self-satisfaction,
and that they are damn fools for doing so. I chal
lenge that on a basis that you will have to grant me.
Even you in your magnificent alertness, unless you
are not entirely normal, will be considerably more
concerned about the fact that your girl broke a date
with you for Big Game night, or the recurrent growth
of that mole on the end of your nose, than of thou
sands of misguided German people dying as a direct
result of the gallant efforts of that paragon of virtue
the R.A.F. You should not be criticized for doing so
either.
As for the tremendously important issues such as
the draft and of being precipitously thrown into a
melee of flying steel and poison gas, etc. (horrible,
isn't, it?), it seems to me that it is a great waste of
effort to try and develop any sort of a complex over
it. We should try to enjoy as much as possible that
amount of peace, quiet and provincialism (really no
crime at all) that is left to us. And besides, there is
really not much point in crossing bridges before you
come to them.
As for your digression on propaganda, it seems to
me that in the ABSENCE OF FACT and the absence
of means to obtain a passive indifference and devote
one's life to the things close at hand which are more
vital.
You query, "How soon are Stanfordites going to
get wise?"
This type of emotionally-charged conceit assumes
that the writer has already reached that Utopian peak
of supreme knowledge, and omnipotence, which en
ables him to look down his patrician nose on our bliss
ful ignorance from his bare watch tower on the pin
nacle of slurring adolescence. ... A delicate bit of
rationalization on your part. «>
And unquestionably, since you are not in the driv
ers' seat, I think that I shall continue to relax and
enjoy life reclining in the back tseat.
Love and kisses,

these columns several days ago?
You, E. G. E.. say slurringly, in your own small,
smug, semi»sophisticated way that the main reason
Stanford men and women arc ignoring outside events
is because of their well-bred, smug, self-satisfaction,
and that they are damn fools for doing so. I chal
lenge that on a basis that you will have to grant me.
Even you in your magnificent alertness, unless you
are not entirely normal, will be considerably more
concerned about the fact that your girl broke a date
with you for Big Game night, or the recurrent growth
of that mole on the end of your nose, than of thou
sands of misguided German people dying as a direct
result of the gallant efforts of that paragon of virtue
the R.A.F. You should not be criticized for doing so
either.
As for the tremendously important issues such as
the draft and of being precipitously thrown into a
melee of flying steel and poison gas, etc. (horrible,
isn't, it?), it seems to me that it is a great waste of
effort to try and develop any sort of a complex over
it. We should try to enjoy as much as possible that
amount of peace, quiet and provincialism (really no
crime at all) that is left to us. And besides, there is
really not much point in crossing bridges before you
come to them.
As for your digression on propaganda, it seems to
me that in the ABSENCE OF FACT and the absence
of means to obtain a passive indifference and devote
one's life to the things close at hand which are more
vital.
You query, "How soon are Stanfordites going to
get wise?"
This type of emotionally-charged conceit assumes
that the writer has already reached that Utopian peak
of supreme knowledge, and omnipotence, which en
ables him to look down his patrician nose on our bliss
ful ignorance from his bare watch tower on the pin
nacle of slurring adolescence. ... A delicate bit of
rationalization on your part. «>
And unquestionably, since you are not in the driv
ers' seat, I think that I shall continue to relax and
enjoy life reclining in the back tseat.
Love and kisses,
