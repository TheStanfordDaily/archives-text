## 
### 
In. diagnosing the individual players of tomorrow's classical Big Game,
'Ilie Daily has given the nod to seven Stanford gridders and four Bears
on n man-for-man basis. This is taking for granted that the Cards' ailing
AIJ-American fullback, Norm Standlee, will not be able to perform at
top speed.
ALIFORNIA POSITIONS STANFORD
i'< (} Stalfler (178) I-KR (187) Fred Meyer
alfler is a senior whose strongest point is his defensive play. Meyer,

<i Not only i.she an experienced lineman, outstanding on ofi'ense as wcU
■in defense, but he handles the important punting assignments with boots
aviating around 50 yards. Banducci is the most promising sophomore
a kle on the Coast, doing his best when the going is rough. FDCiE TO
KLINIIARD.
A)f Anderson (190) LGR (205) Dick Palmer
Anderson i.s rather inexperienced; though he isn't brilliant, he can be
co i: idered a good blocker and tackier. Palmer has shown all season ex
ff'l Monal football sense for a sophomore. His alert lin.ebacking and de
i' -ir'vi signal calling has made him the backbone of the Card defense.
1..' ill: TO PALMER.

1 harh's Donohoe (178) RGL (202) Charles Taylor
Donohoe is another of Cal's light, fast, and fiery linemen who have
oui -barged and outfoxed their opponents during the season. Taylor is an
i<;< ; I guard, built low to the ground, heavy, and fast charging. He single
handed stopped a Washington drive for a touchdown and has stamped
J itr "If as one of the outstanding linemen in the conference. EDGE TO
TAYLOR.
George Herrero (lf>0) RTL (215) Ed Stamm
Herrero has proved himself a come-through artist and is especially
effective on defense because of his vicious charge. Stamm, a sophomore,
has the stature but not the speed or experience to make him a great tackle
FOGE TO lIERREEO.
' orley Mathewson (185) REL (180) Stan Graff
Mathewson i.s the Bears' pass-catching 2nd who has made a good come
-1 ici: this year. He, however, is not as steady on defense as Graff, who is
i st as good at catching a pass as he is at dumping interference and stop
i.ing the ball-carrier. EDGE TO GRAFF.
siJl Klmore (195) Q (170) Frank Albert
Elmore is a fine blocking back and a fair country signal caller. Albert,
Oil the other hand, i.s more versatile. His quarterbacking has been brilliant
I roughout the year, his leadership responsible for more than one Card

< : v Matcher (176) LHR (1»0) Hugh Gallarneau
California's left halfback packs the burden of the Bear offense and
he goes so goes the team. Hatcher went in the U.S.C. and Oregon games
<i so Cal won. A hard runner as well as a constant breakaway threat
: cause of his speed, Hatcher is Cal's most consistent ground gainer. Gal-
I meau is much similar in his style of play—a power runner as well as a
' d burner. SLIGHT EDGE TO HATCHER.
n Jurkovich (185) RHL (173) Pete Kmetovic
Jurkovich is Cal's sophomore sensation who can score on either power
long spectacular runs. The Bears' right half can pass and kick if he
tailed upon. Kmetovic with his breath-taking speed and change of
K'(\ his pass receiving and punt returning has become the high scorer on
< Indians' Rose Bowl-bound team. SLIGHT EDGE TO KMETOVIC.
xU McQuary (183) F (202) Milt Vucinich
McQuary has an excellent ground-gaining average for the season with
: quick starting power. He can kick and pass if necessary and is a cool,
.perienccd ball player. Vucinich, pressing to fill the large gap left by the
i'once of Standlee, has plenty of natural drive but lacks experience,
pecially on defense. EDGE TO McQUARY.

McQuary has an excellent ground-gaining average for the season with

i'once of Standlee, has plenty of natural drive but lacks experience,
pecially on defense. EDGE TO McQUARY.
In. diagnosing the individual players of tomorrow's classical Big Game,
'Ilie Daily has given the nod to seven Stanford gridders and four Bears
