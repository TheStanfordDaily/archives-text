# Indians, Grizzlies Wreak Minor Pre-Game Damage

### AMIE REICHERT 
While the Farm last night was yelling its collective head o<T in one
of the most successful Big Game rallies in Stanford's history, over in
Berkeley the boys were whooping it up in a far less organized way.
Twenty Cal students were arrested as the student body indulged in
comparatively mild pre-gamc demonstrations, and although police re-

ported that the damage hit an
time low, things were not exactly
quiet on the other, side of the water.
Bonfires blazed on many of the
street corners on and off campus.
Only Stanford vandalism reported
was an "S" which, strangely enough,
was reversed—burned in a lawn po
posite Hilard Field, the second larg
est athletic field at Berkeley.
NO STANFORDS
According to reports from the
Daily Californian last night, there
were no Stanford students in the
Cal vicinity, and if there were
they were being pretty inoffensive.
The person or persons responsible
for the kerosene-burned "S" were
not discovered.
Although the Stanford students
responsible for the recent raids on
the Berkeley campus in violation of
Ihe agreement signed last month
by Bruce Jossup and John Mac-
Pherson, presidents of the two stu
dent bodies, have been apprehended,
as yet the Cal offenders have not
been discovered.
Aside from the threat of Stanford i
blitzkriegs however, the Cal stu- j
dents were having domestic troubles
in addition last night. Guards sta- I
toincd around the huge pyre which I
is to be lit at tonight's Berkeley rally i
evidently were caught napping j
when two small boys of the local j
aggregation proceeded to lug sev
eral of the crates and logs away '
from the unlit pile and started a j
private bonfire in front of Bowles
Hall.
