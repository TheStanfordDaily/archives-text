# Tomorrow's Game Recalls Cal Rivalry
## 
### HAP EVERETT 
Fighting to maintain their lead in
the Big Game series, Stanford's In
dians go into Memoiral Stadium at
Berkeley tomorrow to choke off a
Cal rally that lias closed the gap
considerably in the past four years.
Stanford has a 20 to 17 margin in
Big Games played during the first
15 years of the rivalry with eight ;
games ending in ties. Never since !
the Cal Wonder Team have the |
Bears trampled Stanford into the I
turf so consistently as in recent
years.
After the Vow Boys left, Cal
.started to work on the Indians' ad
vantage in the Big Game series with
the result that the lead has been
pared to three games.
A sensational catch by Perry
Thomas of Vic Bottari's pass in the
'36 game started a parade of Bear
points. Thomas fell across the goal
line making a one-hand stab and
after a couple of intercepted passes,
Cal wound up on the long end of a
20-0 score.
BEARS REACH PEAK
Then the Bears reached their peak
during the senior year of the great
Chapman, Meek, Herwig, Schwartz
combination. In the rain Stanford
went down to defeat 13-0 with
Paulman, Fay, and Coffis unable to
get going on the .sloppy turf.
The Big Red Team failed to click
when the chips were down in '38,
being denied touchdowns twice on
the Cal two-yard line. After domi
nating the play for 55 minutes, the
Indians were defeated when Bottari
tossed a pass to Angelo Reginato for
ihe lone score.
Battling to stay out of the Coast
Conference cellar, last year the old
rivals met in Stanford Stadium be
fore GO.OOO faithful fans who knew
that the Big Game would be a lulu
no matter where the Bears and In
dians were in the standings. The
Golden Bear triumphed 32-14.
INDIANS TO REGAIN CREST
So now Stanford has to pour it on
to preserve their record of more
wins since 1892 and to end this streak
of Bear victories that has made the
last four years a monotonous story.
Before this, series of unfortunate
incidents, Stanford was riding the
crest in Big Game competition.
FIRST BIG AME
Stanford and Cal got off to a bad
start in the first Big Game. At first
Roble girls doubted the propriety
of attending the game, but the Cal
women said it would be proper for
women to go and Stanford girls
agreed to attend. This was on a
cold day in March, 1892, and every
thing was ready. Seven thousand
fans at four-bits apiece filled the
old Haight Street grounds in the
city. Only one thing went wrongâ€”
there was no ball. The crowd waited
until 4:15 for that pigskin but it was
worth it for Stanford drew first
blood in the great rivalry-to-be,
14-10.
BULLETS FLY IN '95
Archie Rice, '95, tells of one ex
citing event in Big Game history.
"On the night of the 1894 Big
Game, Whitehouse, '96, former Stan
ford varsity tackle, and Rosenfeld,
'95, were seriously bullet-wounded
and the face of McMillan. '97, for
me i varsity guard, was grazed by a
third bullet fired from a revolver
at close range by a disgruntled Cal
undergraduate. Since there were no
deaths, the affair was hushed up and
settled out of court."
BEARS CAPTURE AXE
In 1899 an event occurred that
heightened Big Game fever and
spurred on the friendly hatred be
tween the two schools. E. A. St rout
of Stanford, entrusted with the Stan
ford Axe, a new token of victory
that originated in that year, was
attacked by two dozen Cal men on
back street near the old Haight
ball park following a baseball game.
The Bears captured the axe, cele
brated, and plunged it into a gov
ernment-protected vault in a Berke
ley bank.
CAL COMES UP
Stanford's streak extended to 1931
but in 1928 the Indians had to come
from behind to gain a 13-13 tie.
Hank Schaldach led Cal to victory
for the first time in eight years in
'31 as Phil MofTatt rode the bench.
The Immortal 21, filthy-cord-clad
Sequoia men, recovered the Axe
and Stanford played way over its
head in 1932 to fight off valiant
Schaldach for a scoreless tie.
Whether a new cycle starts to
morrow or not remains to be seen,
but it's about time that Stanford
consolidated that fast-disappearing
edge in Big Game competition.
