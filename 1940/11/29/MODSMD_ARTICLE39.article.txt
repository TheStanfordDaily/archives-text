'J'HIS is the big one.
Way back in the days before j
the curtain went up on the 1940 i
football spectacle, before either ex
perts or rooters seriously mentioned
Stanford and "Rose Bowl" in the i
same breath, before Clark Shaugh
nessy and his downtrodden Indians
became the terror of the Coast by
rolling up eight straight sparkling i
victories, there was one sentiment i
in the minds of everyone connected
with the Farm.
"Beat Cal and we'll be happy."
That was the way talk ran in pre
season bull sessions. Since that time
dreams of the Pasadena bid, of an
undefeated season, of top national
ranking, relegated the annual Axe
classic to the limbo of forgotten
causes.
But in the past week the Big
Game spirit has llamcd into being
on both the Palo Alto and Berke
ley campuses. Here at Stanford
there's a crusade afoot to regain
the Axe after its four-year so- (
journ in the hands of the Golden
Bear. Across the bay California
is primed to upset the favored
Indians and end their winning |
streak.
So as the Axe yell echoes back j
and forth across Memorial Stadium
tomorrow afternoon two great teams |
will stage a battle that will go down ■
in the gridiron annals of the two I
schools alongside the thrillers of the
past.
There's none of the "Big Game is |
the Big Game even if both teams !
haven't won this season" attitude j
this year. There's nothing of the ;
Yale-Harvard tradition in this clas- j
j sic.
This conflict has a 44-game back- ,
j ground, is between two natural
rivals situated only a few miles i
apart, but tradition will have to
share the spotlight with national j
football prominence when the teams j
clash tomorrow.
The consistent improvement of
i the Bears over the season has dc- J
I stroyed the suspicion created in
| early October, following the Mich
igan debacle, thai this year's Cal-
Stanford meeting would be a rout.
There's little talk along that lino
j today. When they handed the U.S.C. j
Trojans a 20-7 defeat in their Los
Angeles bailiwick, the Blue and Gold
warriors proved that Ihey now rank j
1 with the best in the country.
So when the cardinal-jerseyed
Indians and the blue-shirted Bears
line up for the kickoff tomorrow
afternoon, 75,000 fans will start on j
a joyride of thrills that can be
matched only by the outstanding Big
Games of the past.

For three years Norm has been

a star of the Stanford team. No
one will deny that during this
period he has consistently been
the most valuable single player
on the squad. He has done as
much for Stanford football.
In the last two California games,
Norm has been a great player on a
losing team. This year he has a
chance to be an even greater player
on a winning team.
Whether or not his ankle is mend
ed enough to allow '"The Chief" to
take part in the fray tomorrow, no
fitter man could be named to lead
the Indians in their attempt to re
gain the Axe. No player is more
deserving of the honor.
Norm Standlee will be the
Stanford acting captain tomorrow.

The best indication of the wide

It'll be Sunday morning, not Sat
urday afternoon, in Manila, but a
large group of Stanford and Cali
fornia alumni will gather to listen
to the Big Game, relayed halfway
around the world by short-wave
radio.
In a decade when the doings
of dictators usually clutter up the
ether, it is encouraging that
Americans can be this interested
in intercollegiate sport.

Way back in the days before j
the curtain went up on the 1940 i
football spectacle, before either ex
perts or rooters seriously mentioned
Stanford and "Rose Bowl" in the i
same breath, before Clark Shaugh
nessy and his downtrodden Indians
became the terror of the Coast by
rolling up eight straight sparkling i
victories, there was one sentiment i
in the minds of everyone connected
with the Farm.
"Beat Cal and we'll be happy."
That was the way talk ran in pre
season bull sessions. Since that time
dreams of the Pasadena bid, of an
undefeated season, of top national
ranking, relegated the annual Axe
classic to the limbo of forgotten
causes.
But in the past week the Big
Game spirit has llamcd into being
on both the Palo Alto and Berke
ley campuses. Here at Stanford
there's a crusade afoot to regain
the Axe after its four-year so- (
journ in the hands of the Golden
Bear. Across the bay California
is primed to upset the favored
Indians and end their winning |
streak.
So as the Axe yell echoes back j
and forth across Memorial Stadium
tomorrow afternoon two great teams |
will stage a battle that will go down ■
in the gridiron annals of the two I
schools alongside the thrillers of the
past.
There's none of the "Big Game is |
the Big Game even if both teams !
haven't won this season" attitude j
this year. There's nothing of the ;
Yale-Harvard tradition in this clas- j
j sic.
This conflict has a 44-game back- ,
j ground, is between two natural
rivals situated only a few miles i
apart, but tradition will have to
share the spotlight with national j
football prominence when the teams j
clash tomorrow.
The consistent improvement of
i the Bears over the season has dc- J
I stroyed the suspicion created in

igan debacle, thai this year's Cal-
Stanford meeting would be a rout.
There's little talk along that lino
j today. When they handed the U.S.C. j
Trojans a 20-7 defeat in their Los
Angeles bailiwick, the Blue and Gold
warriors proved that Ihey now rank j

spread interest in tomorrow's clash
comes from across the Pacific.
It'll be Sunday morning, not Sat
urday afternoon, in Manila, but a

In a decade when the doings

'J'HIS is the big one.
Way back in the days before j
the curtain went up on the 1940 i
football spectacle, before either ex
perts or rooters seriously mentioned
Stanford and "Rose Bowl" in the i
same breath, before Clark Shaugh
nessy and his downtrodden Indians
became the terror of the Coast by
rolling up eight straight sparkling i
victories, there was one sentiment i
in the minds of everyone connected
with the Farm.
"Beat Cal and we'll be happy."
That was the way talk ran in pre
season bull sessions. Since that time
dreams of the Pasadena bid, of an
undefeated season, of top national
ranking, relegated the annual Axe
classic to the limbo of forgotten
causes.
But in the past week the Big
Game spirit has llamcd into being
on both the Palo Alto and Berke
ley campuses. Here at Stanford
there's a crusade afoot to regain
the Axe after its four-year so- (
journ in the hands of the Golden
Bear. Across the bay California
is primed to upset the favored
Indians and end their winning |
streak.
So as the Axe yell echoes back j
and forth across Memorial Stadium
tomorrow afternoon two great teams |
will stage a battle that will go down ■
in the gridiron annals of the two I
schools alongside the thrillers of the
past.
There's none of the "Big Game is |
the Big Game even if both teams !
haven't won this season" attitude j
this year. There's nothing of the ;
Yale-Harvard tradition in this clas- j
j sic.
This conflict has a 44-game back- ,
j ground, is between two natural
rivals situated only a few miles i
apart, but tradition will have to
share the spotlight with national j
football prominence when the teams j
clash tomorrow.
The consistent improvement of
i the Bears over the season has dc- J
I stroyed the suspicion created in
| early October, following the Mich
igan debacle, thai this year's Cal-
Stanford meeting would be a rout.
There's little talk along that lino
j today. When they handed the U.S.C. j
Trojans a 20-7 defeat in their Los
Angeles bailiwick, the Blue and Gold
warriors proved that Ihey now rank j
1 with the best in the country.
So when the cardinal-jerseyed
Indians and the blue-shirted Bears
line up for the kickoff tomorrow
afternoon, 75,000 fans will start on j
a joyride of thrills that can be
matched only by the outstanding Big
Games of the past.

I or not Norm Standlee
| is able to face California in his
I last Big Game will probably not be
I finally decided until kickoff time
| tomorrow afternoon.
For three years Norm has been

a star of the Stanford team. No
one will deny that during this
period he has consistently been
the most valuable single player
on the squad. He has done as
much for Stanford football.
In the last two California games,
Norm has been a great player on a
losing team. This year he has a
chance to be an even greater player
on a winning team.
Whether or not his ankle is mend
ed enough to allow '"The Chief" to
take part in the fray tomorrow, no
fitter man could be named to lead
the Indians in their attempt to re
gain the Axe. No player is more
deserving of the honor.
Norm Standlee will be the
Stanford acting captain tomorrow.
