# Aggies Smashed By Texas, 7-0
## 
### 
AUSTIN, Tex., Nov. 28 (UP).—
One bad minute, in which Texas
made the game's only touchdown,
today ended the Texas Aggies' 19-
game winning streak and their Rose
Bowl hopes.
The score was 7 to 0.
Texas got the opening kickofl on
their 35 when the ball went out of
bounds. Pete Layden, Texas full
back who was the day's outstanding
player, passed 32 yards to halfback
Jack Crain. A second pass fell in
complete. Then halfback Noble
Doss made a spectacular catch of
another Layden pass on the Aggie
one-foot line.
Layden scored over right guard
on the first try, four downs after
the kickofl. Crain kicked the extra
point—and that was the ball game.
Forty-five thousand persons, larg
est crowd ever to see a Southwest
Conference game, then saw 59 min
utes of furious football. But those
j seven points held good. Texas' vic
| tory kept intact a 19-year record
; of beating the Aggies at Austin, and
it kept alive the hopes of Southern
Methodist and Rice, each beaten only
j once, to tie the Aggies for the con
j ference championship.
