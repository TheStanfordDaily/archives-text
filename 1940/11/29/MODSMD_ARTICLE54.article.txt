# COACH CLARK MEETS STUB ALLISON
## 
### 
Coach Clark Shaughnessy will
coach his first Big Game tomorrow.
He received his education at Min
nesota where in 1912 and 1913 he
was selected as a member of the
all-Big Ten team for tackle, end,
and fullback. He was also an out
standing member of the track team,
competing in the middle distances
and in all of the weight events.
From 1915 to 1926 he was coach
at Tulane. In 1925 his midget loot
ball team was the first Southern
squad asked to compete in the Rose
Bowl classic, but school officials re
fused the invitation because the
'earn was too light. When he started
coaching at the Southern school,
there was a very inadequate field,
but by the time he departe'd, Tu
lane had the biggest football sta
dium in the South.
Shaughnessy took over the coach
ing duties at Loyola of the South
in 1927, and remained there until
ihc school banned football in 1933.
From Loyola Shaughnessy moved
to Chicago in 1933, His victory rec
ord there was definitely not im
pressive through no fault of his
own. The faculty stopped giving
athletic scholarships, a de-emphasis
was placed on sports, and the under
graduate part of the school had prac
tically disappeared.
At the end of the 1939 season,
Chicago abandoned football for in
tramural sports. Shaughnessy was
offered a life-time position as direc
tor of intramural athletics, but he
refused in order to assume his
coaching position at Stanford. While

at Chicago he developed an all-
American, Jay Berwanger, one of
the greatest halfbacks ever to play
for the Maroons.
Stub Allison started coaching for
California in 1935, following Navy
Bill Ingram. Befoie taking over the
head coaching responsibilities, he
was an assistant under Ingram. He
graduated from Carleton in 1917.
Allison sent a "new wonder team"
to the Rose Bowl on January 1, 1937,
only to be defeated by Alabama.
13-0. The stars of that year were
Vic Bottari, Sam Chapman, John

Meek, and Bob Herwig. Chapman
and Hei wig were picked on most of
the All-American teams for the
1936 season.
In the five Big Games Allison has
coached, he has turned back the
challenge of the Indian from the
Farm four times. His only defeat
at the hands of Stanford was suf
fered in 1935.. when the Cards left
the field with a 13-0 win. For three
years after that contest the Bears
held Stanford scoreless, but last
year the combination of Albert and
Meyers clicked for two touchdowns.

Shaughnessy took over the coach
ing duties at Loyola of the South
in 1927, and remained there until
ihc school banned football in 1933.
From Loyola Shaughnessy moved
to Chicago in 1933, His victory rec
ord there was definitely not im
pressive through no fault of his
own. The faculty stopped giving
athletic scholarships, a de-emphasis
was placed on sports, and the under
graduate part of the school had prac
tically disappeared.
At the end of the 1939 season,
Chicago abandoned football for in
tramural sports. Shaughnessy was
offered a life-time position as direc
tor of intramural athletics, but he
refused in order to assume his
coaching position at Stanford. While

at Chicago he developed an all-
American, Jay Berwanger, one of
the greatest halfbacks ever to play
for the Maroons.
Stub Allison started coaching for
California in 1935, following Navy
Bill Ingram. Befoie taking over the
head coaching responsibilities, he
was an assistant under Ingram. He
graduated from Carleton in 1917.
Allison sent a "new wonder team"
to the Rose Bowl on January 1, 1937,
only to be defeated by Alabama.
13-0. The stars of that year were
Vic Bottari, Sam Chapman, John

Meek, and Bob Herwig. Chapman
and Hei wig were picked on most of
the All-American teams for the
1936 season.
In the five Big Games Allison has
coached, he has turned back the
challenge of the Indian from the
Farm four times. His only defeat
at the hands of Stanford was suf
fered in 1935.. when the Cards left
the field with a 13-0 win. For three
years after that contest the Bears
held Stanford scoreless, but last
year the combination of Albert and
Meyers clicked for two touchdowns.

Coach Clark Shaughnessy will
coach his first Big Game tomorrow.
He received his education at Min
nesota where in 1912 and 1913 he
was selected as a member of the
all-Big Ten team for tackle, end,
and fullback. He was also an out
standing member of the track team,
competing in the middle distances
and in all of the weight events.
From 1915 to 1926 he was coach
at Tulane. In 1925 his midget loot
ball team was the first Southern
squad asked to compete in the Rose
Bowl classic, but school officials re
fused the invitation because the
'earn was too light. When he started
coaching at the Southern school,
there was a very inadequate field,
but by the time he departe'd, Tu
lane had the biggest football sta
dium in the South.
