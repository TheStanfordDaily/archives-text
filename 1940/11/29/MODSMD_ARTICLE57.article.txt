# Key Men Out as Tankmen Seek to Upset Bears Again
## 
### 
Officially invading the Cal campus without threat of reprisal, the
Stanford varsity water polo team will travel to Berkeley for a game with
the Bear varsity at II o'clock tomorrow morning. Led hy Captain Ted
Moreno, the Cards will attempt to repeat a 6-4 triumph that they gained
earlier in the season. a

"Absence of two key men puts
| two strikes on us already, but we
will be in there fighting," stated
| Coach Nort Thornton Wednesday.
Thornton was referirng to the ab
sence of sprint man Bill Weeden,
' who left the campus early this week
i for an inter-fraternity conference in
i New York City, and Bob Mitchell,
J stellar guard, who is confined to the
hospital with a case of flu and will
1 not be able to play Saturday. Fred
j Manwaring will lose several days'
| practice this week because of a
[ scratched eyeball but will be able
to compete Saturday.
Reports from Berkeley indicate
i that the Bears have been practicing
; hard ever since their upset, defeat
earlier in the month and have defi
j nite ideas of vengeance upon the
Indians.
"The Bears are mad about that
defeat and will pull no punches for
! a chance to swamp us," said Coach
I Thornton.
Absence of the key men will ne
j cessitate a big change in the Stan
! ford line-up, according to Thornton.
| Two men who started the season as
1 regulars will be starting tomorrow

V
j for the first time in several games.
Bruce Jessup and Bob Tietjen had
their position won away i'rom them
shortly after the season started, but
will be in the starting line-up tomor
row as centerback and forward, re
spectively.
The Cards will field Dave Nottage
: at sprint, Manwaring and Tietjen at
forwards, Jessup at centerback, Cap
! tain Moreno and Bob Jones at
| guards, and Bob Breckner in the
1 cage. Nottage has been the Cards'
j ace offensive foi-ward and Jones a
| shining light as centerback until the
j change was made necessary.
Cal is still relying a great deal on
its two ace forwards, Don Aronson
and Tad Mitchell, to keep up the
fine scoring record that they have j
maintained so far this season and on
the sterling efforts of Captain
Woody Woodman in the goal to keep
the Cards from scoring too freely. |
After the last game they have finally |
come to realize the potentialities of
the Stanford squad and will not
| take them as lightly as they did
after, the two Card defeats by
U.C.L.A.
