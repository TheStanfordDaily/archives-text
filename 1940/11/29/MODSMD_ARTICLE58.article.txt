# Grid Season Nears Finale Tomorrow
## 
### 
Although it seems that it was only
I yesterday that footballs started
floating over the nation's gridirons,
| the 1940 pigskin campaign is speed
| ily drawing to a close. Already foot
| ball enthusiasts are speaking in
i terms of "bowls" and All-American
j teams, and after tomorrow's game;
j the majority of the nation's top elev
j ens will call it quits for the year.
THE EAST
While the highly touted Cornell
I Indians and the surprisingly strong
Pennsylvania Quakers were getting
most of the headlines, the fighting
I Boston College Eagles were sweep
ing to their second consecutive sea
son without a defeat. With such boys
as End Gene Goodreault and 240-
j pound Center Gene Gladchuck on
i the line opening the way for All-
American contender Chick O'Rourke,
the backs like Henry "The Hammer"
Toczylowski and "Blackjack" Holo
vack, the Eagles knocked over nine
formidable opponents and es
tablished themselvse as the "best" in
the East.
Pre-season favorite Cornell made
the experts look good in the early
j part of the year, but two weeks be
fore the close of their season they
| met disaster in the form of a Dart
mouth team that has been pushed
j around by all previous opponents.
; The Dartmouth win was probably
| the biggest reversal of the year, and
was the first defeat suffered by the
| Cornellians in two seasons,
i Pennsylvania was the surprise
t6am of the East this year. Coach
J Munger took a green bunch of boys
I and developed a fighting line which
i sprung flashy Francis Reagan into
the open for numerous touchdowns
| and probably onto a majority of the
All-American teams.
The Quakers, however, had two
| "'cold" Saturdays, being trounced by
■ Michigan and tied up by lowly Har
vard. Georgetown was the other
eastern power team, but was defeated
by Boston College IS-18, in one of
I the best games of the year.
| THE MIDWEST
As expected, the Midwest pre
sented a maze of powerhouses from
which Minnesota's mighty Golden
Gophers emerged battered, out
gained, outplayed but undefeated.
But because they won their games,
the Gophers must be placed on top
I of Midwestern football.
Close behind them, and probably
j one of the best of this year's elev
j ens, comes the mighty Wolverines of
; Michigan. With strength on the line,
with Forrest Evashevski and the in
; comparable Tommy Harmon in the
backfield, Michigan went through
j their season with one loss—a one
j point defeat by Minnesota.
Close behind these two teams is
Northwestern, who lost only to
Michigan and Minnesota and last
week ended its season with an im
pressive 20-0 win over Notre Dame.
Ohio State, which started the sea
son out like a "juggernaut," lost a
heart-breaker to Minnesota and from
then on fell completely apart. The
same is true of Notre Dame, which
gave promise of being one of the
best of all Irish teams ever devel
oped. The Irish fall was started by
Army, then Navy and finally ce
mented by a gallant lowa team.
THE SOUTH
Exactly as it was Inst year, the
Southern picture was dominated by
Tennessee. With backs three deep,
and a line boasting of several All—
Americans, the Volunteers swept
aside all opponents and went through
to their third straight undefeated
season.
Other Southern "strength" elev
ens were Duke, Clemson, Alabama,
and Mississippi State.
The biggest flop in the South was
Georgia Tech. The Bulldogs with
I Bob Ison on the wing, and tihy
J Johnny Bosch as the offensive
1 threat, seemed loaded. But the Tech
j team wilted away, and ended near
! the cellar of their conference.
THE SOUTHWEST
Despite their upset loss to the Uni-
I versity of Texas, 7-0. yesterday,
Texas A. & M. still has a chance to
I be the first team in history to win
i the undisputed Southwest Confer
' ence title two years in a row. How
-1 ever, if Rice and Southern Meth-
I odist each win their games tomor
i row, the winner of the Rice-S.M.U.
contest the following Saturday will
be tied for the championship with
! the Aggies.
