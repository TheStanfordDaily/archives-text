### 
SACRAMENTO. Nov. 28 (UP).â€”
Southern California conservation
clubs today urged Gov. Culbert 01-
j son to retain present fish and game
commissioners in making appoint
ments under the new lisli and game
law approved at the November
election.
Edmund M. Brock, Los Angeles.
| president of the club council, said
j about 50 organized sports and con
j servation clubs approved the recom
mendation. The new law provides
| for a commission of five members,
as at present, but with six-year
j terms staggered so that only one
. term will expire in any particular
j year.
The staggering term plan was
suggested "to remove the commis
! sion from politics." Governor Olson
! will name all five members to start
| the new system, with confirmation
required by the Senate. Members
[ may be removed by a majority vote
| of both houses of the legislature.
Present commissioners are Nate
Milnor, Mono County, chairman;
Edwin L. Carty, Oxnard; Lee F.
Payne, Los Angeles; Germaine Bul
cke, San Francisco, and Ben Wil
liams, Alturas.
