# Conn, Savold Tangle Tonight
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 28 (UP). —
Billy Conn and Lee Savold. both
striving for a title shot at Joe Louis,
tangle tonight at Madison Square
Garden in the year's most important
heavyweight contenders' battle.
Handsome Billy is favored at 5 to
1 because he already is the light
heavyweight champion, because lit
is the ling's most brilliant boxer,
and because he has never lost a
New York bout.
Conn's 175-pound crown will not
be at stake in this 12-round brawl
because Savold, the Dos Moines dy
namiter, is a genuine heavyweight,
scaling about 18(> pounds. This will
give lethal Lee more than 10 pounds
advantage over Pittsburgh Billy,
who expects to weigh about 174.
Although Conn has beaten four
other heavies with comparative
ease in hi'; drive toward a Louis
bout, most fight experts regard these
5-1 odds with amazement. That
price by no means reflects the risk
that Conn is taking with his pres
tige tomorrow night when he tackles
the hardest hitter he ever met. Sa
vold, the blond bomber, enters the
ring riding a string of five straight
knockouts, and he has belted out 17
of his last 22 opponents.
Savold is doubly dangerous be
cause he is young—only 24, an ex
cellent boxer who was schooled by
Mike Gibbons, and a rugged chap
who claims never to have been
kayoed.
