## 
### 
Stanford's freshman basketball
team will open its 11)40--! 1 season
Monday, when they tangle with t'ie
strong Marin J. C. five in the Stan
ford Pavilion. The Frosh will run
through a scrimmage this afternoon
with the Salinas Junior College team
in preparation for their opening
game.
Coach Beeb Lee is looking forward
to this scrimmage,' which will en
able him to choose a starting lineup
for Monday's game. At present start
ing positions are wide open,
STIFF OPENER
Coach Lee called Marin Junior
Colljge a "stiff opener." The Bull
dogs have provided the Frosh stiff
competition in past years, although
the Cards have won in the last two
encounters.
Stanford was pronounced as being
behind schedule in the matter of
nractices. Coach Lee said that labs
have been interfering with practices,
making it impossible to get all of
the team together at the same time.
For that reason, the Frosh have been
put through their paces at night
during the past few days.
At center the top contenders for
starting spots are Bob Wreisner, Dick
McDonough and Charles Moore. All
three boys have been showing about
the sahie abiilty around the pivot
spot, and any one of them might
get the call for Monday's game.
FIGHT FOR SPOTS
There are four frosh fighting' it up
for the forward positions. Bill
Hooper from Kiski, a small but fiery
man; Frank McCann, a dead-eye
from Piedmont High School; Diek
West from Portland and Dick Mid
dle ton.
The guard positions will find
John Leddy, Fred Oliver and Bob
Halstead battling for the starting
spots. Leddy is up from the frosh
football team, where he played a lot
of end.
