# Papoose-Cub Tilt Tomorrow
## 
### 
Although still hunting for their
initial win, Stanford's frosh soccer
squad will be slight favorites when
they play the second half of their
"big game" with the Cal yearlings
Saturday morning at Berkeley.
Since the Papooses made such a
good showing Wednesday afternoon
against the Bearbabes" tying them
3-3, without the services of several
key men, they stand a good chance
of emerging victorious in their two
game series against the hooters from
across the bay.
KEY MEN BACK
Bob Sol and Jose Rey, two im
portant cogs in the frosh's offense,
are expected to be back in good
shape. Rey was able to hobble
around at center forward in Wed
nesday's game but was unable to
run, thereby limiting his scoring
possibilities considerably. Sol did
not play at all in the first Cal tussle
but .should assume his center for
ward position. Both men hail from
South America.
DIEBENKORN CAPTAIN
The defense will be bolstered con
siderably too with the return to the
fullback spots of "Hank" Peters and
Dick Diebenkorn, captain in Wed
nesday's battle. Peters is recovering
from a case of influenza, while
Diebenkorn received a leg injury
early in the game against the Cubs.
Jack Pagen, outstanding man on
the field in Wednesday's contest,
will start at his right half-back post
from which he plays a good offen
sive as well as defensive game. The
two other halfbacks will be Phil
Chapman and Bob Hannah. Chap
man is probably the hardest kicker
on the squad.
John Gertridge will play right
wing with Sol and Rey trading ofT
at the center forward and left wing
positions. The two remaining posts,
inside left and right, will be manned
by Jere McWethy, E. K. Hartley, and
Bud Creary. Bob Brooks will ably
handle the goal.
