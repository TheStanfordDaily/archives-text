# Papoose Gridders Cop Crown
## Frosh Victory Over Cal Climaxes Perfect Season 
### DON SELBY 
the crest of their biggest victory wave since an ail-victorion.s
year in 1938. Stanford's frosh gridders swept through a six-game sched
ule this fall to win the Little Big Four championship with nary a defeat
or tie to mar their record.
Climax of the season came with a 7-6 victory over the University of
California yearlings, which marked the fourth consecutive year that

Coach Harry Shipkey's
crews have been victorious in the i
Little Big Game.
The Papooses went into the Cal
game as definite favorites, but, as
in all Cal-Stanford competition, sea- j
son records went for naught, and the i
little Indians had to come from be- j
hind to cop the contest.
KNOCK over use.
The Shipkeymen reached their |
peak mid-way in the season when
they knocked over a highly touted j
University of Southern California I
freshman eleven by a 20-12 score, j
After a first half that was all U.S.C., i
the Papoofe.s came from behind in ;
the third quarter to ring up two |
quick touchdowns, ihus establishing |
a lead which they held throughout j
the game.
Aside from these two hard-fought |
contests, the Indian yearlings rolled j
through the season like a ball of
fire, trouncing each and every team
they met by overwhelming scores.
They started out the season with
a 21-0 win over San Mateo, followed :
by .">B-0 and 47-(» victories over |
U.C.L.A. frosh and Modesto J.C., j
respectively. Between the U.S.C. j
frosh and Cal frosh games, the Ship- 1
laymen sandwiched in a 38-0 win
over Chaffey J.C.
Let's review some of Shipkey's j
first stringers:
LEFT END JIM ELLIS: Was one
of the best place-kickers Stanford !
has seen in years. Ellis isn't very |
big, hut he was consistently good j
both on offense and defense.
LEFT TACKLE JEAN LA
MOURE: Big and strong, he was |
outstanding on defense. With more I
finesse he should make a good var- '
sity tackle.
LEFT GUARD BILL JOSLYN:
Was potentially the best lineman on J
the frosh team, but played in spurts. ;
On some days he was really brilliant, j
CENTER LOItEN LA PRADE:
Too much praise can't be given this i
stalwart of the Papoose line. On j
defense he was all over the field !
making resounding tackles, stopping j
plays before they got to the line of
scrimmage. On offense he was a i
sure-fire blocker. He was co-cap- j
tain of the team.
RIGHT GUARD KELLY ROSS: A
fightei all the way, this Arkansas
lmy played good ball all year. He j
was a good blocker.
RIGHT TACKLE DARWIN SEE
LEY: Made his bid for fame when
he intercepted a pass in the Tro
babe game and rambled 65 yards
to a touchdown. On defense he was
a stone wall, playing steady ball all
season.
RIGHT ENDS BILL WILSON
AND BILL BRUBAKER: Split the
starting assignments, with Bruba
ker getting Ihe call early in season :
while Wilson started the last three
games. Brubaker was an outstand
ing offensive end, but Wilson's stel
lar defensive play put him on the
first team after the first four games. !
QUARTERBACK JOHN KEN
WARI): Steadiness was this boy's j
strongest forte. He blocked well all '
season and played brilliantly on !
defense in several games.
LEFT HALF 808 MITCHELL: A
steady runner and an excellent pass
er, Mitchell was the team's main
offensive throat throughout the sea
son.
RIGHT HALF 808 KOCII: Was
one of the most versatile backs on
the team. He passed to several
touchdowns, and xvas one of the \
most devastating runners on the
team. He was co-captain of the
team.
FULLBACK BUCK FAWCETT:
For power down the middle it was !
Fawcett who got the call. An ex- !
ceptionally fast boy. he should make i
a good varsity back. He handled !
the kicking for the Papooses.
There are numerous other frosh j
players who played good ball dur
ing the season and deserve credit, j
but lack of space makes it impos- I
sible to mention them all here.
Leading scorer on the team was j
Fawcett, who tallied 30 points, while
Koch and Frank Forbes, reserve left
half, each hit pay dirt four times
for 21 points apiece. The other |
scorers were: Mitchell, 18; Jim
Troupe, 18; Lee Scott, 12; Joe Mar
dcsich, 12; Ellis, 11; Doyle Coldiron,

University of Southern California I
freshman eleven by a 20-12 score, j
After a first half that was all U.S.C., i
the Papoofe.s came from behind in ;
the third quarter to ring up two |
quick touchdowns, ihus establishing |
a lead which they held throughout j
the game.
Aside from these two hard-fought |
contests, the Indian yearlings rolled j
through the season like a ball of
fire, trouncing each and every team
they met by overwhelming scores.
They started out the season with
a 21-0 win over San Mateo, followed :
by .">B-0 and 47-(» victories over |
U.C.L.A. frosh and Modesto J.C., j
respectively. Between the U.S.C. j
frosh and Cal frosh games, the Ship- 1
laymen sandwiched in a 38-0 win
over Chaffey J.C.
Let's review some of Shipkey's j
first stringers:
LEFT END JIM ELLIS: Was one
of the best place-kickers Stanford !
has seen in years. Ellis isn't very |
big, hut he was consistently good j
both on offense and defense.
LEFT TACKLE JEAN LA
MOURE: Big and strong, he was |
outstanding on defense. With more I
finesse he should make a good var- '
sity tackle.
LEFT GUARD BILL JOSLYN:
Was potentially the best lineman on J
the frosh team, but played in spurts. ;
On some days he was really brilliant, j
CENTER LOItEN LA PRADE:
Too much praise can't be given this i
stalwart of the Papoose line. On j
defense he was all over the field !
making resounding tackles, stopping j
plays before they got to the line of
scrimmage. On offense he was a i
sure-fire blocker. He was co-cap- j
tain of the team.
RIGHT GUARD KELLY ROSS: A
fightei all the way, this Arkansas
lmy played good ball all year. He j
was a good blocker.
RIGHT TACKLE DARWIN SEE
LEY: Made his bid for fame when
he intercepted a pass in the Tro
babe game and rambled 65 yards
to a touchdown. On defense he was
a stone wall, playing steady ball all
season.
RIGHT ENDS BILL WILSON
AND BILL BRUBAKER: Split the
starting assignments, with Bruba
ker getting Ihe call early in season :
while Wilson started the last three
games. Brubaker was an outstand
ing offensive end, but Wilson's stel
lar defensive play put him on the
first team after the first four games. !
QUARTERBACK JOHN KEN
WARI): Steadiness was this boy's j
strongest forte. He blocked well all '
season and played brilliantly on !
defense in several games.
LEFT HALF 808 MITCHELL: A
steady runner and an excellent pass
er, Mitchell was the team's main
offensive throat throughout the sea
son.
RIGHT HALF 808 KOCII: Was
one of the most versatile backs on
the team. He passed to several
touchdowns, and xvas one of the \
most devastating runners on the
team. He was co-captain of the
team.
FULLBACK BUCK FAWCETT:
For power down the middle it was !
Fawcett who got the call. An ex- !
ceptionally fast boy. he should make i
a good varsity back. He handled !
the kicking for the Papooses.
There are numerous other frosh j
players who played good ball dur
ing the season and deserve credit, j
but lack of space makes it impos- I
sible to mention them all here.
Leading scorer on the team was j
Fawcett, who tallied 30 points, while
Koch and Frank Forbes, reserve left
half, each hit pay dirt four times
for 21 points apiece. The other |
scorers were: Mitchell, 18; Jim

Climax of the season came with a 7-6 victory over the University of

LEFT END JIM ELLIS: Was one
of the best place-kickers Stanford !
has seen in years. Ellis isn't very |
big, hut he was consistently good j
both on offense and defense.
LEFT TACKLE JEAN LA
MOURE: Big and strong, he was |
outstanding on defense. With more I
finesse he should make a good var- '
sity tackle.
LEFT GUARD BILL JOSLYN:
Was potentially the best lineman on J
the frosh team, but played in spurts. ;
On some days he was really brilliant, j
CENTER LOItEN LA PRADE:
Too much praise can't be given this i
stalwart of the Papoose line. On j
defense he was all over the field !
making resounding tackles, stopping j
plays before they got to the line of
scrimmage. On offense he was a i
sure-fire blocker. He was co-cap- j
tain of the team.
RIGHT GUARD KELLY ROSS: A
fightei all the way, this Arkansas
lmy played good ball all year. He j
was a good blocker.

FULLBACK BUCK FAWCETT:
For power down the middle it was !
Fawcett who got the call. An ex- !
ceptionally fast boy. he should make i
a good varsity back. He handled !
the kicking for the Papooses.
There are numerous other frosh j
players who played good ball dur
