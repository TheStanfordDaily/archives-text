# Glove Tourney Finals Slated For January 23
## 
### 
The All-University and Novice
boxing tournaments, in past years
held at different dates, have been
scheduled for the same time this
year, according to Clayton Frye, box
ing coach.
The finals have been tentatively
set for January 23. Dates for the
elimination matches will not be de
termined until the number of tourna
ment entrants is known.
Another innovation this year will
be the awarding of an expensive
wrist watch with the Stanford seal
on its face to the All-University
heavyweight champion. The watch is
donated by Mr, Jack Rice, alumnus
and former member of the B.A.C.
TOURNEY DIVISIONS
EXPLAINED
The Novice tourney is open to all
men who have never won a Stan
ford tournament or who are not
members of the Card team. All men
registered at Stanford are eligible
for the All-University.
Student boxers have been working
out and training for the tournaments
for the past two months and work
outs with San Jose and San Fran
cisco State have been held.
Outstanding boxers who will prob
ably see action in one of the two
tournaments include: heavyweights,
Don Grant. Johnny Ward, and Vic
Lindskog; 165 pounds, Ed Stone, Ken
Rosengren, and Jim Thurman; 155
pounds, Tom McMichael, Bronell
Carr, Jim McCloud, A 1 Smith, and
George Torassa; welterweight. Frank
Hewett. Aubrey Fairfax, and Walt
Stoessel.
LIGHTWEIGHT BOXERS
Lightweights are John Wilson,
Blair Hyde, Dick Lyon, and Johnson
Chin: and in the 127-pound class are
Paul Spain and Bruce Berg.
Following the two tournaments,
boxers selected for the team will go
into a strenous training period and
the intercollegiate boxing season will
open with a match early in February.
The schedule is not yet drawn up,
but will be at a meeting of graduate
managers of coast colleges to be held
in the near future.
Coach Frye, author of a book on
boxing just recently published, is
optimistic over the team's prospects.
"Everything looks good and we
should have a winning team," he re
ports. "However, we are weak in
the lighter weights."
