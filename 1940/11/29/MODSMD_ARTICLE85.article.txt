# Rugby to Have Veteran Team
## 
### 
With the possibility that Stan
ford's ace backfield combination of
Frankie Albert, Hugh Gallarneau,
Norm Standlee, and Pete Kmetovie
may turn from the current grid
wars to play rugby this winter,
Harry Maloney, minor sports di
rector, is confident of a strong 1941
club.
The Indian ruggers have amazed
coast fans in the last eight seasons
with their steady winning play, hav
ing tied the Golden Bears for the
Northern California Rugby Union
title last year with seven scalps and
one loss.
The four wow boys, along with
Ned Pugh and Carl Gerlach, who
return from the '30 team, will prob
ably form a working nucleus at the
start of the season.
Volunteei Coach Jim Wylie will
probably divide duties with Ma
loney and the two men of experience
should build another team capable
of repeating in the Coast Union.
With seven straight victories be
hind them last year, the ruggers
barely were downed by Cal in the
tussle that decided the league tie.
Other men probably returning are
Bob Oider, Art Geissler, Paul Ugrin,
AI Wool, Francis Morgan, and Jake
Thompson.
