## Inexperienced Stanford crew Winds Up First Rowing Quarter 
### JERRY BRUCKER, Sports Editor 
Willi a crew practicing regularly three times a week, the Stanford crew
is winding up its initial quarter of rowing, the lirst to he held in nearly
twenty years.
I hough positions are far from definite, the crew, as it has been practic
ing. is made up as follows: Bow, Boh Porter; 2. Lee Peake; 3. John Hoi-

,Tom: 4, R>ger Boas; 5, Carl Gerlach;
6, Ted Cole; 7. Bob Schaeffer; stroke,
John Maclean; cox, Wylt Drake.
Despite the inexperience of the
oarsmen, the boat has been moving
surprisingly well, and the water
manship has been constantly im
proving.
John Maclean, a sophomore trans
fer from U.C.L.A., has been strok
ing the crew with a great deal of
spirit that has made the men be
hind him work hard at all times.
Maclean rowed in the freshman boat
at U.C.L.A. and will thus not be
eligible for competition, but having
an experienced oarsman in the
stroke seat has been a great help to
the crew.
Wall Drake has been doing most
of the steering of the shell, and
shows signs of becoming a promising
coxswain. He has done remarkably
well in negotiating the tricky chan
nel of the Redwood Harbor course.
Two of the biggest obstacles con
fronting the Boat Club have now
been removed. Thanks to the gen
erosity of Mr, W. A. Gould, of
Mountain View, the crew has been
given the use of a motor launch,
which will greatly help in coaching.
Another major obstacle was the
lack of a suitable launching raft.
This, too, has now been removed, as
Redwood City has just completed a
float for the exclusive use of the
crew.
With facilities for some thirty
persons, the membership of the Boat
Club is to be enlarged next quarter.
Freshmen especially are wanted.
Anyo-.e interested is urgd to turn
out next quarter as most of the row
ing then will be confined to pre
liminary training, prior to the shell
rowing of the spring quarter. Gym
credit will be given, or Upper Di
vision men can register for one unit.

the crew.
Wall Drake has been doing most
of the steering of the shell, and
shows signs of becoming a promising
coxswain. He has done remarkably
well in negotiating the tricky chan
nel of the Redwood Harbor course.
Two of the biggest obstacles con
fronting the Boat Club have now
been removed. Thanks to the gen
erosity of Mr, W. A. Gould, of
Mountain View, the crew has been
given the use of a motor launch,
which will greatly help in coaching.
Another major obstacle was the
lack of a suitable launching raft.
This, too, has now been removed, as
Redwood City has just completed a
float for the exclusive use of the
crew.
With facilities for some thirty
persons, the membership of the Boat
Club is to be enlarged next quarter.
Freshmen especially are wanted.
Anyo-.e interested is urgd to turn
out next quarter as most of the row
ing then will be confined to pre
liminary training, prior to the shell
rowing of the spring quarter. Gym
credit will be given, or Upper Di
vision men can register for one unit.
Willi a crew practicing regularly three times a week, the Stanford crew
is winding up its initial quarter of rowing, the lirst to he held in nearly
twenty years.
I hough positions are far from definite, the crew, as it has been practic
ing. is made up as follows: Bow, Boh Porter; 2. Lee Peake; 3. John Hoi-

,Tom: 4, R>ger Boas; 5, Carl Gerlach;
6, Ted Cole; 7. Bob Schaeffer; stroke,
John Maclean; cox, Wylt Drake.
Despite the inexperience of the
oarsmen, the boat has been moving
surprisingly well, and the water
manship has been constantly im
proving.
John Maclean, a sophomore trans
fer from U.C.L.A., has been strok
ing the crew with a great deal of
spirit that has made the men be
hind him work hard at all times.
Maclean rowed in the freshman boat
at U.C.L.A. and will thus not be
eligible for competition, but having
an experienced oarsman in the
stroke seat has been a great help to
the crew.
