# Grid Squad Has Preview Of Gaieties
## Jolly-up to Follow Afternoon Showing; Davis' Hand to Play 
### RUTH MELLINKOFF 
An afternoon of entertainment to
morrow at the Gaieties will be
capped hy the traditional Big Game
Jolly-up. The dress rehearsal last
night of the Ram's Head extrava
ganza was applauded vigorously by
scattered members of the varsity
squad, guests, and the cast itself.
It was complete with Muheim
stalking, orchestra leader in shirt
sleeves, members of the stage crew
peeping out from the wings, and
Bud Cady. Typical Muheimism:
"Let me caution tjie cast not to
walk across the stage; 'you're rip
pling the sky."
The draft skit and the jail se
quence are good for the laughs; the
park bench scene is good for love
and Bud Cady is riotous. The whole
show is chuck full of originality and
fun.
Although there was the usual last
minute confusion—stone walls shak-

FREE JOLLY-UP
When the matinee performance of
the Gaieties is over, the audience
will leave the theater to try and
emulate the dancing of Adolfo Arias
and Co. at the Big Game Jolly-up.
Whether or not they will succeed
shouldn't discourage anyone from
going over to the Women's Gym
and doing a little dancing to Jimmy
Davis and his orchestra. Admis
sion is free, and there is nothing
like tuning up for the more serious
business of Saturday niqht.
