# Card Poloists Finish Season With Defeat
## 
### 
Winning two out of three games
played, the Stanford polo team
wound up the fall season with a
.687 average.
The Indians opened their season
with a double win over the Utah
Redskins, 4-3, 7-3, but were not so
successful in their next encounter,
dropping the first of two scheduled
games, 11-1. to the University of
Arizona at Tucson over the Thanks
giving holiday. The second game
and a possible chance for revenge
was washed out by rain.
The team that has been used in
the games this fall, and the goals
scored by the individual players,
follow:
No. 1. Bill Dirker (2) and Alike
Gates (1)-; No. 2, Captain Joe Smtih
(1); No. 3, A. T. LaPrade (4); No. 4,
Stan Glikbarg (3). Smith, LaPrade,
and Glikbarg are veterans, while
Dirker and Gates are newcomers to
the squad.
The score was tied. 3-3, at, the end
of the regulation six chukkers in
their first contest with the Utes,
but the teams decided that who
ever scored the first goal in their,
next game would be declared win
ner of the first. Stanford was award
ed the initial game when they
knocked through a goal in the first
period. They went on to win that
game also by a margin of four tallies.
In the Arizona game the locals
became disorganized in the last two
periods and enabled their hosts to
add seven scores to the four they
already had to win in a walk.
Major Francis Garrecht, Indian
coach, -is attempting to line up one
more practice game for his charges
before the Christmas vacation. The
mallettecrs usually take a forced
lay-off during winter quarter due
to inclement weather.
