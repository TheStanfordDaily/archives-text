# WE'LL GET THE AXE, THE AXE
## Game Crowd Is a Show Worth Seeing Card Stunts, Bands Add to the Mammoth Big Game Spectacle 
### 
A roaring crowd packing the Me
morial Stadium, two sets of brilliant
half time card stunts, a pair of
brightly garbed bands made up of
Ihe cream of the musicians of two
great universitiesâ€”all this DeMille
spectacle will take a back seat to
morrow when two football teams
match talent.
Bui, during time-outs, between
halves, and after the final gun the
spotlight, will he on the crowd it
self. The story, the drama, takes
place not only on the emerald turf
of the gridiron, but also in the
stands. From far and near they
come to Berkeley or Palo Alto, de
pending on the year, to see both the
actual game and the show that
goes with it.
For it's the greatest of all shows,
for thrills, for atmosphere, for pulse
pounding, eye dimming thrills and
sentiment.
It's the one and oply Big Game.
There's more meaning packed into
those five little slugs of type than
could be packed into a volume the
size of Webster's International.
RANKS WITH CLASSICS
This annual clash between the
elevens of Stanford and California
ranks with the best and oldest rival
ries in the country, in any country.
With the battle for,the Little Brown
Jug, the Army-Navy meeting, and
the mellowing tradition of the Yale
liarvard game, this is one of the
classics of football.
Tied in with this rivalry is the
story of the Stanford Axe. No one
knows where this little hunk of
steel actually came from, but to the
13,000 singing, chanting, yelling
rooters who will vie with each other
from opposite sides of the field, pos
session of the Axe will mean more
than anything else in life for a
two and a half hour period.
EXPERTS THERE
Most of the rest of the 75,000
screaming fans will be the alumni
of the two schools on hand to cheer
their Alma Mater 011 to victory. But
in addition there'll be others, some
who never went to college, a great
many who literally are not yet out
of short pants, who are looking for
ward to the time when they can lay
claim to a more important, role in
the drama of the Big Game.
And high above this colorful mass
will be a few dozen men who will
try to keep cool while the rest of
the world is in turmoil. Tear your
eyes away from the glimmer of the
Axe, the thrill of the game, for a
moment during the afternoon, and
take a look up there. It's not a spec
tacular part of the Big Game, but
there's just as much feeling high up
in the press box as in the rooting
section. It'o another facet of the
color of a gridiron classic.
TWILIGHT COMES
And after the game all rivalry
will be forgotten for the moment
as the supporters of the two bands
of gridiron warriors meet for cheers,
songs, and, finally, the singing of the
two Alma Maters.
And so another Big Game will be
history, as the crowd files out the
exits, but before that, happens
there'll be a short snatch of high
power living that no one who wit
nesses it will be able to forget.
