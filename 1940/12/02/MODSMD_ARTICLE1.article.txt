AS it bccamc apparent tliat
France would fall to Hitler's
mechanized legioas last May, Italy's
Premier Mussolini decided to
throw his country into the war on
the side of the Germans. So eager ,
was II I)uce to get "in on the kill"
that he declared war on France
before his nation was actually {
ready for such a move.
The alliancc between Italy and I
Germany has been a peculiar one j
for many reasons, and yet it has been
no more peculiar than other agree- j
ments reached since Hitler began his
mad game of world domination.
Italy participated against Germany
in the World War, although her en
trance into the conflict did not meet
with popular approval among the
masses of Italian people. Italy fared
badly in the fighting and when the
peace was drawn up at the conclu
sion of the war, she was largely
overlooked in the dispensation of
spoils. The Italian governing class
and those persons of the "intelli
gentsia" who wished to see Italy re
turn to the days of Roman glory
were grieved by the Treaty of Ver
sailles.
But the rest of the Italian people,
while they had no particular love
for the framers of the peace, were
more grieved with their own ruling
class for getting the nation into
what seemed to them a useless
war.
Depression and revolution fol
lowed. Mussolini came into power on
the cry that he alone could save the
country from communism.
But Italy, a nation largely non
self-sufficient, did not pull out en
tirely from her pre-war status of one
of the poorest nations in Europe.
* * n>
jyjUSSOLINI, like Hitler several
years later, attempted to com
pensate for this lack of material
prosperity with the injection into
the minds of the people of a feeling
of national pride and spirit. Italy
soon became an aggressive, nation
alistic nation.
So Mussolini gave his people
the hope for a greater future—al
though this did not mean neces
sarily a future of more bread and
hutter. Mussolini entered the pact
with Hitler because of the like
ness of conditions within the two
countries and because of their like
positions in the world of nations.
As the year 1940 draws to a close,
observers are beginning to wonder
whether the entry of Italy into the
war last May may not be the most
important single event of the year—
in so far as an eventual victory for
the Allies is concerned. Italy today
seems to be the vulnerable factor in
the Axis sfctup and every new hope
for the British cause comes from
some new discovery of Italian
weakness.
* * *
IS possible that Italian failures
in the Balkan campaign and in the
action against the Suez have moved
the Germans to go more slowly in
their drive to the East. Certainly,
Greek victories over the Italians
have tended to bolster the courage
of the Turks and Bulgarians to re
sist Nazi pressure.
While the British continue to be
hard-pressed bv the German sub
marine blockade, possibility of a
British offensive against the weak
link of the Axis increases daily.
Offensive tactics have won for the
Germans to date; only a British
counter-offensive will turn the tide
of this war.
1940 has been a German year; but
1941 may well be a British year if she
is able to capitalize on the weak
nesses of Italy—the country that last
May jumped to get. "in on the kill."
But until aid from the United
States has been stepped up to
counter-balance Germany's superior
war productivity, Britain will re
main in a precarious position at
home. And as Leslie Hore-Belisha
has pointed out, the way to lessen
the pressure on the Isles is to strike
at Italy and knock her out of the
war. This may be expected as an
important part of British strategy
during the coming year. Before
long, the Italian people may be
grieved at a ruling clique that drags
them into a senseless war.

The alliancc between Italy and I
Germany has been a peculiar one j
for many reasons, and yet it has been
no more peculiar than other agree- j
ments reached since Hitler began his
mad game of world domination.
Italy participated against Germany
in the World War, although her en
trance into the conflict did not meet
with popular approval among the
masses of Italian people. Italy fared
badly in the fighting and when the
peace was drawn up at the conclu
sion of the war, she was largely
overlooked in the dispensation of
spoils. The Italian governing class
and those persons of the "intelli
gentsia" who wished to see Italy re
turn to the days of Roman glory
were grieved by the Treaty of Ver
sailles.
But the rest of the Italian people,
while they had no particular love
for the framers of the peace, were
more grieved with their own ruling
class for getting the nation into
what seemed to them a useless
war.
Depression and revolution fol
lowed. Mussolini came into power on
the cry that he alone could save the
country from communism.
But Italy, a nation largely non
self-sufficient, did not pull out en
tirely from her pre-war status of one
of the poorest nations in Europe.

jyjUSSOLINI, like Hitler several
years later, attempted to com
pensate for this lack of material
prosperity with the injection into
the minds of the people of a feeling
of national pride and spirit. Italy
soon became an aggressive, nation
alistic nation.
So Mussolini gave his people
the hope for a greater future—al
though this did not mean neces
sarily a future of more bread and
hutter. Mussolini entered the pact
with Hitler because of the like
ness of conditions within the two
countries and because of their like
positions in the world of nations.
As the year 1940 draws to a close,
observers are beginning to wonder
whether the entry of Italy into the
war last May may not be the most
important single event of the year—
in so far as an eventual victory for
the Allies is concerned. Italy today
seems to be the vulnerable factor in
the Axis sfctup and every new hope
for the British cause comes from
some new discovery of Italian
weakness.
* * *
IS possible that Italian failures
in the Balkan campaign and in the
action against the Suez have moved
the Germans to go more slowly in
their drive to the East. Certainly,
Greek victories over the Italians
have tended to bolster the courage
of the Turks and Bulgarians to re
sist Nazi pressure.
While the British continue to be
hard-pressed bv the German sub
marine blockade, possibility of a
British offensive against the weak
link of the Axis increases daily.
Offensive tactics have won for the
Germans to date; only a British
counter-offensive will turn the tide
of this war.
1940 has been a German year; but
1941 may well be a British year if she
is able to capitalize on the weak
nesses of Italy—the country that last
May jumped to get. "in on the kill."
But until aid from the United
States has been stepped up to
counter-balance Germany's superior
war productivity, Britain will re
main in a precarious position at
home. And as Leslie Hore-Belisha
has pointed out, the way to lessen
the pressure on the Isles is to strike
at Italy and knock her out of the
war. This may be expected as an
important part of British strategy
during the coming year. Before
long, the Italian people may be

was II I)uce to get "in on the kill"
that he declared war on France
before his nation was actually {
ready for such a move.
The alliancc between Italy and I
Germany has been a peculiar one j
for many reasons, and yet it has been
no more peculiar than other agree- j
ments reached since Hitler began his
mad game of world domination.
Italy participated against Germany
in the World War, although her en
trance into the conflict did not meet
with popular approval among the
masses of Italian people. Italy fared
badly in the fighting and when the
peace was drawn up at the conclu
sion of the war, she was largely
overlooked in the dispensation of
spoils. The Italian governing class
and those persons of the "intelli
gentsia" who wished to see Italy re
turn to the days of Roman glory
were grieved by the Treaty of Ver
sailles.
But the rest of the Italian people,
while they had no particular love
for the framers of the peace, were
more grieved with their own ruling
class for getting the nation into
what seemed to them a useless
war.
Depression and revolution fol
lowed. Mussolini came into power on
the cry that he alone could save the
country from communism.
But Italy, a nation largely non
self-sufficient, did not pull out en
tirely from her pre-war status of one
of the poorest nations in Europe.

jyjUSSOLINI, like Hitler several
years later, attempted to com
pensate for this lack of material
prosperity with the injection into
the minds of the people of a feeling
of national pride and spirit. Italy
soon became an aggressive, nation
alistic nation.
So Mussolini gave his people
the hope for a greater future—al
though this did not mean neces
sarily a future of more bread and
hutter. Mussolini entered the pact
with Hitler because of the like
ness of conditions within the two
countries and because of their like
positions in the world of nations.
As the year 1940 draws to a close,
observers are beginning to wonder
whether the entry of Italy into the
war last May may not be the most
important single event of the year—
in so far as an eventual victory for
the Allies is concerned. Italy today
seems to be the vulnerable factor in
the Axis sfctup and every new hope
for the British cause comes from
some new discovery of Italian
weakness.

IS possible that Italian failures
in the Balkan campaign and in the
action against the Suez have moved
the Germans to go more slowly in
their drive to the East. Certainly,
Greek victories over the Italians
have tended to bolster the courage
of the Turks and Bulgarians to re
sist Nazi pressure.
While the British continue to be
hard-pressed bv the German sub
marine blockade, possibility of a
British offensive against the weak
link of the Axis increases daily.
Offensive tactics have won for the
Germans to date; only a British
counter-offensive will turn the tide
of this war.
1940 has been a German year; but
1941 may well be a British year if she
is able to capitalize on the weak
nesses of Italy—the country that last
May jumped to get. "in on the kill."
But until aid from the United
States has been stepped up to
counter-balance Germany's superior
war productivity, Britain will re
main in a precarious position at
home. And as Leslie Hore-Belisha
has pointed out, the way to lessen
the pressure on the Isles is to strike
at Italy and knock her out of the
war. This may be expected as an
important part of British strategy
during the coming year. Before
long, the Italian people may be
grieved at a ruling clique that drags
them into a senseless war.
