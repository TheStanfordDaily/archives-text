Leland Stanford was president of
the Central Pacific Railroad Com
pany, and he was one of the main
participants in the ceremonies cele
brating the joining of the Union

"THE FRENCHMAN"
"Encina" refers to the California
live oak, and "Roble" refers to the
California white oak. Most of Stan
ford's residences are named for trees.
"The Frenchman," a mysterious
character around whom many tales
have revolved, came to Mayfield in
1874, giving his name as Peter

Coutts. He was reported to have
brought with him enormous wealth,
but who he was and whence he got
his money were not known to the
people of the time.
He disappeared in 1881 after
spending much money on unique
buildings and towers. He is said to
have built towers because he was
forever on the lookout for enemies,
and some say he tunneled escape
passages from tower to tower
through the Santa Clara hills.
In 1925 the probable truth indi
cated that he was Paulin Caperon,
former director of the Bank of Bor
deaux, and that he was in hiding to
escape the payment of bank debts
as the result of its failure.
