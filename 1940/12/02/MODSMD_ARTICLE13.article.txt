# STANFORD VS. NEBRASKA IN BOWL
## Indians Defeat Cal, 13-7; Scores by Gallarneau, 'Kmet' Bring Back Axe Huskers First Big Six Team To Receive Bid 
### 
A question which lias been
plaguing the minds of football fans
the country over since mid-Novem
ber when it appeared certain that
Stanford would be the West's rep
resentative in the Rose Bowl next
January 1 was answered at 9 o'clock
last night.
For at that time Stanford's Grad
uate Manager A1 Masters concluded
negotiations with Major Lawrence T.
"Biff" Jones, athletic director and
head football coach of Nebraska
University to the effect that the Big
Six champions would be the In
dians' opponent in Pasadena in 1941.
Earlier in the afternoon a stream
lined edition of Stanford's Board of
Athletic Control held a special meet
ing to make the important choice.
Three members of the board. Mas
ters, Professor William B. Owens,
president of the N.C.A.A. and faculty
member on the 8.A.C., and Norm
Standlee, the Cards' all-Americafi
fullback and student member on the
board, made the selection and nego
tiations were soon under way.
BIG SIX CHAIRMAN NOTIFIED
Masters first notified Dr. H. D.
Bergman, chairman of the faculty
representatives of the Big Six, and
Bergman polled the members of the
Midwest Conference to eliminate a
ruling concerning post-season games.
By telephone Masters concluded
arrangements with Nebraska through
Major Jones. This means that the
Cornhuskers will be the first Big
Six team to uphold the honors of the
East against the cream of the Coast
in Pasadena.
Just within the last few days has
Nebraska emerged as the logical
candidate, what with the defeat of
Texas A. & M., Tennessee's and Bos
ton's acceptance of bids to the Sugar
Bowl, Cornell's and Pennsylvania's
refusal to come west, the Big Nine's
iron rule against letting their mem
bers, Michigan and Minnesota in
particular, participate in a post-sea
son classic.
| ONLY BLACK MARK
The only mark against the Corn
huskers' record was a 13-7 beating
by Minnesota, which is ranked by
many as the top team in the nation
| This beating came at the very be
; ginning of the season, and though
"Biff" Jones' boys outplayed the
Gophers, they yielded to a 49-yarc
pass in the final minutes of the
game.
Next they trampled once prouc
| Pitt 14-7 and, going back into the
j conference to sew up their title, the
! Huskers turned back lowa State 21-
' 12 and knocked off Kansas State, as
mentioned, 20-0.
This ran their season's total to 175
points as against 64 for their op
ponents. This is the identical total
that Clark Shaughnessy's flashy In
dians have run up in the same num
ber of games; however, the Cards
have yielded 72 points to their op
ponents.
Stanford's coach and new hero,
Clark Shaughnessy, was highly
pleased with the B.A.C.'s selection.
Shaughnessy is a close friend of the
Cornhuskers' line coach, Link Ly
man, and has a high regard for the
coaching ability and the character of
Lyman and his boss, Major Jones.

j conference to sew up their title, the
! Huskers turned back lowa State 21-
' 12 and knocked off Kansas State, as
mentioned, 20-0.
This ran their season's total to 175
points as against 64 for their op
ponents. This is the identical total
that Clark Shaughnessy's flashy In
dians have run up in the same num
ber of games; however, the Cards
have yielded 72 points to their op
ponents.
Stanford's coach and new hero,
Clark Shaughnessy, was highly
pleased with the B.A.C.'s selection.
Shaughnessy is a close friend of the
Cornhuskers' line coach, Link Ly
man, and has a high regard for the
coaching ability and the character of
Lyman and his boss, Major Jones.
A question which lias been
plaguing the minds of football fans
the country over since mid-Novem
ber when it appeared certain that
Stanford would be the West's rep
resentative in the Rose Bowl next
January 1 was answered at 9 o'clock
last night.
For at that time Stanford's Grad
uate Manager A1 Masters concluded
negotiations with Major Lawrence T.
"Biff" Jones, athletic director and
head football coach of Nebraska
University to the effect that the Big
Six champions would be the In
dians' opponent in Pasadena in 1941.
Earlier in the afternoon a stream
lined edition of Stanford's Board of
Athletic Control held a special meet
ing to make the important choice.
Three members of the board. Mas
ters, Professor William B. Owens,
president of the N.C.A.A. and faculty
member on the 8.A.C., and Norm
Standlee, the Cards' all-Americafi
fullback and student member on the
board, made the selection and nego
tiations were soon under way.
BIG SIX CHAIRMAN NOTIFIED
Masters first notified Dr. H. D.
Bergman, chairman of the faculty
representatives of the Big Six, and
Bergman polled the members of the
Midwest Conference to eliminate a
ruling concerning post-season games.
By telephone Masters concluded
arrangements with Nebraska through
Major Jones. This means that the
Cornhuskers will be the first Big
Six team to uphold the honors of the
East against the cream of the Coast
in Pasadena.
Just within the last few days has
Nebraska emerged as the logical
candidate, what with the defeat of
Texas A. & M., Tennessee's and Bos
ton's acceptance of bids to the Sugar
Bowl, Cornell's and Pennsylvania's
refusal to come west, the Big Nine's
iron rule against letting their mem
bers, Michigan and Minnesota in
particular, participate in a post-sea
son classic.

The only mark against the Corn
huskers' record was a 13-7 beating
by Minnesota, which is ranked by
many as the top team in the nation
