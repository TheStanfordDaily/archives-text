Stanford's Wow Boys of 1940 ended a four-year Big Game
drought when they handed Cal a convincing 13-7 licking
Saturday before 75,000 fans in Berkeley's Memorial Stadium.
The Indians overcame a stubborn Golden Bear with two
second period touchdowns, returning the Axe to the Farm

+aftcr it liad remained four .years in
Berkeley. The victory pave Stan
ford undisputed claim to the Pacific
Coast Conference championship and
the right to represent the West in
the Rose Bowl.
Under the tutelage of Coach Clark
Shaughnessy, this Indian squad bo
came the first since 1914 to go
through its schedule undefeated and

untied, climbed to second place in
the national rankings behind Min
nesota.
NINTH WIN
In chalking up their ninth win of
the year against a traditional foe,
their play was steady and cffoctiv ,
though they didn't triumph by as
big a margin as rabid Farm rooters
had hoped they would. A valiant
California defense and a gridiron
that appeared to have suffered badly
from a heavy dew along the side
lines prevented a more decisive final
score.
After an even first quarter,
"Skeeter Peter" Kmetovic drove
over the Bear right tackle from the
one-yard line for the opening tally.
The score climaxed a 58-yard sus
tained drive featured by 22- and H
yard sprints by Hugh Gallameau, a
12-yard pass from Frankie Albert to
Clem Tomerlin, and a 19-yard run
by Kmetovic.
ALBERT CONVERTS
Albert booted the conversion with
Kmetovic holding. A few minutes
later the Indian quarterback at
tempted a 40-yard field goal that
missed only by about 6 feet, going
slightly to the left of the uprights
and below the crossbar.
A bad pass from center which
gave Stanford the ball on downs on
the Bear 35 led to the second score.
Gallarneau went over left guard on
the sixth play for two yards and the
score. This time Albert's kick wont
wide and the Indians retired at the
half with a 13-0 lead.
LONE CAL SCORE
The lone California score came
when Jack McQuary, Boar fullback,
smashed 9 yards through left guard
to the end zone with 17 seconds to
play. McQuary place-kicked the
extra point.
But before that the most dra
matic moments of the game took
place. With the ball on the Stanford
41, Albert fired a third-down
intended for A1 Cole into the flat to
his left. The Bears' Carl Hoberg
came up fast, .snagged the ball, and
