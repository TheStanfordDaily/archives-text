### JERRY BRUCKER 
Stanford's Wow Boys of 1940 ended a four-year Big Game
drought when they handed Cal a convincing 13-7 licking
Saturday before 75,000 fans in Berkeley's Memorial Stadium.
The Indians overcame a stubborn Golden Bear with two
second period touchdowns, returning the Axe to the Farm

+aftcr it liad remained four .years in
Berkeley. The victory pave Stan
ford undisputed claim to the Pacific
Coast Conference championship and
the right to represent the West in
the Rose Bowl.
Under the tutelage of Coach Clark
Shaughnessy, this Indian squad bo
came the first since 1914 to go
through its schedule undefeated and

untied, climbed to second place in
the national rankings behind Min
nesota.
NINTH WIN
In chalking up their ninth win of
the year against a traditional foe,
their play was steady and cffoctiv ,
though they didn't triumph by as
big a margin as rabid Farm rooters
had hoped they would. A valiant
California defense and a gridiron
that appeared to have suffered badly
from a heavy dew along the side
lines prevented a more decisive final
score.
After an even first quarter,
"Skeeter Peter" Kmetovic drove
over the Bear right tackle from the
one-yard line for the opening tally.
The score climaxed a 58-yard sus
tained drive featured by 22- and H
yard sprints by Hugh Gallameau, a
12-yard pass from Frankie Albert to
Clem Tomerlin, and a 19-yard run
by Kmetovic.
ALBERT CONVERTS
Albert booted the conversion with
Kmetovic holding. A few minutes
later the Indian quarterback at
tempted a 40-yard field goal that
missed only by about 6 feet, going
slightly to the left of the uprights
and below the crossbar.
A bad pass from center which
gave Stanford the ball on downs on
the Bear 35 led to the second score.
Gallarneau went over left guard on
the sixth play for two yards and the
score. This time Albert's kick wont
wide and the Indians retired at the
half with a 13-0 lead.
LONE CAL SCORE
The lone California score came
when Jack McQuary, Boar fullback,
smashed 9 yards through left guard
to the end zone with 17 seconds to
play. McQuary place-kicked the
extra point.
But before that the most dra
matic moments of the game took
place. With the ball on the Stanford
41, Albert fired a third-down
intended for A1 Cole into the flat to
his left. The Bears' Carl Hoberg
came up fast, .snagged the ball, and
started goalward with four-man in
terference.
Albert, covering up on the pass,
fought off the four blockers, drove
Hoberg back into the center of the
field, where he and Jack Francis
brought him down a yard short of
the goal.
Before a play could be run the
quarter ended and the Indian first
string came back on the field to put
up the best goal-line stand of the
season and take the ball away from
the Bears on the one-foot line.
Sophomore tackle Ed Stamm did a
heroic job on this occasion, making
two of the four stops himself.
Naming an outstanding player on
the Cardinal squad is an impossible
task. Chuck Taylor. Bruno Ban
ducci, Hugh Gallarneau, Boscoe
Graff, Dick Palmer, Stamm, Frankie
Albert, Freddy Meyer, Pete Kmeto
vic. Clem Tomerlinâ€”all these and
more played a large part in the
victory.
But if there are two men who de
serve more credit than the other
members of the squad, they are
Norm Standlee and Doug Stahle.
The Chief, probably as a result of
his two weeks' stay in the Palo Alto
Hospital, found himself slowed
down almost to a walk on offense,
but was a very important cog in
the Indian defense. Just how val
uable he was in stopping the Cal
running attack was demonstrated
best when either of his two subs,
Milt Vucinich or Piod Parker, came
into the game.
Stahle played a marvelous game

i tilling in for Vic Lindskog after the
j latter left the field in the first pe
riod. Doug was especially effective
j on pass defense, covering up well
I and intercepting one Bear forward.
For the losers Orv Hatcher was
| the main offensive threat, breaking
I loose for several good gains and car
rying the ball 29 times for an aver
j age of 3.9 yards per try.
The Indians came out of the
i game without serious injuries.
Standlee played in every quarter
without doing his bad ankle any
harm. Lindskog was knocked
groggy, but should be ready for
finals.
