# Ambassador To England Quits Post
## Kennedy to Devote Time Helping Keep Country Out of War 
### 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 1 (UP). â€”
.Joseph P. Kennedy today announced
he has submitted his resignation as
United States Ambassador to Great
Britain so that he may devote his
lime to "the greatest cause in the
world today ... to help the Presi
dent keep the United States out of
war."
He said he submitted his reslgna
-1 ion to President Roosevelt on Nov. 1
but that he had acceded to Mr.
Roosevelt's wish that he continue to
serve until his successor was chosen.
Kennedy added, however, that he
would not return to London as am
bassador.
He announced his resignation after
an unscheduled conference with the
chief executive this morning.
PREPARED STATEMENT
In a prepared statement, Kennedy
said:
"On November 6 1 tendered to the
President my resignation as his am
bassador to the Court of St. James.
"Today the President was good
enough to express regret, over my
decision, but to say that, not yet be
ing prepared to appoint my succes
sor, he wishes me to retain my des
ignation as ambassador until he is.
but I shall not return to London in
that capacity.
"My plan is, after a short holiday, j
lo devote my efforts to what seems !
to me the greatest cause in the j
world today, and means, if success
ful, the preservation of the American i
form of democracy. That cause is to j
help the President keep the United .
States out of war."
ACTION EXPECTED
Kennedy's resignation had been i
anticipated generally. He flew back
from London six weeks ago amid
widespread rumors that he would
resign immediately because he dis
agreed with the Administration for
eign policy. He met these reports,
however, with a nationally broadcast
speech urging Mr. Roosevelt's re
election.
Kennedy flew into Washington un
expectedly Sunday and went direct
ly to the White House for a long and
leisurely discussion with Mr. Roose
f'elt on the whole problem of Brit
ish-United States relations and this
country's representation at the Court
of St. James.
CONFAB AMICABLE
Kennedy, it was learned, told Mr.
Roosevelt that he felt he could ren
der this country greater service by
remaining here and working with
the President to keep the United
States out of war. This work would
be carried on as a private individual.
It would indicate that Kennedy will
not retain any government capacity
after relinquishing his ambassador
ship.
A source close to both Mr. Roose
velt and Kennedy said that their
unscheduled conference today was
most amicable and that the Presi
dent and his ambassador found
themselves in general agreement on
most questions affecting British-
United States relations.
