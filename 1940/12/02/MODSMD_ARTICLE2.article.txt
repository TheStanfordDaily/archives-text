### 
"Rose Bowl Rally? Of course," said Rally Committee Chairmen Bill
Kimhall and Pat Smith last night. "When? Monday, Dec. 30, at 8 o'clock
in the evening. Where? Well, your guess is as good as ours."
Decision on a suitable Los Angeles auditorium to house Stanford's
first official student and alumni rally preceding a Rose Bowl game has

been delayed pending settlement of,
price, size, and other questions.
"We're holding out for a place that
will accommodate every loyal Farm
supporter who wants to come," the
chairmen declared.
Place of the rally and directions
for reaching it will be printed on
the back of the Rose Bowl wind
shield stickers which will be dis-

tributed by Rally Committee next
week. It will also be enclosed in all
Autumn Quarter grade envelopes
mailed out during Christmas vaca
tion.
In addition to the rally, Stanford
will be represented in pre-game fes
tivities by a float in the Tournament
of Roses parade, money for which
was voted by the B.A.C. last week.
The theme will probably be con
nected with the. Farm's fiftieth an
niversary celebration.
Plenty of support and publicity
on the rally has been promised by
southern California sports writers
and by Stanford alumni in all parts
of the state, according to Kimball.
"We want to make this rally just
as important to the alumni as it is
to the student body," he continued.
The program has not been com
pleted, but plans include speeches
by student officers and coaches from
both Stanford and Nebraska, en
tertainment by stars of Farm pro
ductions, talks by recent, graduates,
and plenty of yells and band music.
Arrangements are being handled
by the Rally Committee chairmen
and by Bess Paulsen and Micky
Levee, co-chairmen for the rally.
