# Foresighted Cards Hacksaw Steel Goal Posts Before Tilt
## 
### 
Some guys are good guys. Others
make their goal posts of steel and
embed them in concrete.
When some Stanford students
charged down onto the field after
the game to get the goal posts, there
were broad smiles on the faces of
the California rooters. The cops, too,
smiled, and turned away. There was
no need to watch these goal posts.
Or so they thought.
Up in the radio booth the an
nouncer was telling his audience
that it was impossible for the stu
dents to pull down the posts, and
gave a detailed description of their
wonderful strength.
Yet while the announcer was
complacently talking, the cops look
ing indifferent, and the California
rooters smilingâ€”down came the goal
posts.
Then the announcer went mad, the
cops began to get interested, and
the collective jaws of the California
students dropped.
It was not a superhuman effort on
the part of the Stanford students
that brought the goal posts toppling
down. That part of it was simple.
The real work had been done earlier
in the week.
Late last Wednesday night a group

' of students from two fraternities and
one eating club calmly walked into
the Memorial Stadium and patiently
cut through three quarters of the
steel goal posts. The job, done with
an ordinary hack saw, took two
hours. Very meticulously they re
wrapped the padding around the
cuts in the steel piping, and went
home, with no one but themselves
any the wiser, according to reports
i received by The Daily.
So when the game was over, those
1 in the "know" charged down and
j knocked them over with no more
' trouble than the team had in
i knocking over Cal.
