# Chaplain Tells Quaker Stand Against War
## 
### 
"The Quaker Way," an article ex
| plaining the Quaker attitude toward
'< war, written by Dr. D. Elton True
| blood, professor of philosophy of re
| ligion and University chaplain, was
published in the December issue of
' Wie Atlantic Monthly. Dr. True-
J blood has written several books on
the Quaker faith and co-edits the
"Friend," a Quaker magazine pub
lished in Philadelphia.
The Quaker "Religious Society of
; Friends" is not merely an anti-war
| group, according to Dr. True blood,
| but it also opposes all oppression,
j racial prejudice, and slavery. Con
scientious objection to war is inci
; dental to the group's entire policy
! of seeking to overcome evil with
j good.
CONCRETE EXAMPLE
He referred to the Friends' pro
j gram of reconstruction and child
j feeding during and after the World
j War as a concrete example of the
I Quaker philosophy. They believed
! that if the victorious nations had
| spent as lavishly on such a program
i in 1919 as they spent on war, an
other war would never have ensued.
"The Quaker opposition to war
arises," Dr. Trueblood stated, "not
from refusal to face reality, not from
the nature of the issues in a par
ticular war, and not from fear of
physical death, but from a concep
tion of how the world is to be re
made."
GROUP SACRIFICE
Adherence to the Quaker way does
not make it impossible to see that
submission to invasion at the hands
of those who will destroy freedom

may be the worst possible of all
choices, according to Dr. Trueblood's
article.
However, the Friends believe that
a special group may adhere loyally
and sacrificially to a position which
even the members of the group rec
ognize is not yet possible for the
nation.
