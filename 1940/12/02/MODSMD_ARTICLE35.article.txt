# Stanford Cagers Play Tonight
## Deanmen to Meet Hamline Tonight in Pavilion at 8 
### 
Pre pa red to take over Stanford's
sport spotlight which has for the
last three months been shining on a
bunch of highly successful football
ers. the Cards' 1!»40-41 basketball
team under the guidance of Coach
Everett Dean will open its official
season tonight in the Pavilion at ,X
< clock against Hamline University.
The invaders from Minnesota on
j a barn-storming tour through the
j West lost their first game to De-
Pauw University 26-25 by virtue of a
I last-minute field goal. But Everett
Dean and his cagers are not under
j estimating the Hamline five, which
; has been Minnesota state champions
! for the past nine years.
LINE-UP NOT RELEASED
Although Mr. Dean has not an
nounced any starting line-up as yet
it seems probable that co-Captain
Don Williams and Fordy Anderson
will open at forwards, and co-Cap
tain Kenny Davidson and Bill
Cowden will start at guards. The
only position in doubt is the center
spot, where Don Burness is threat
ening to take over ii# place of last
year's regular, Dick Taylor. Bur
ness, who was a star as a sopho
more but was injured last season, is
pressing the towering Taylor for
starting honors.
j BUT FAST
Another unit on the other hand
specializes in speed and not size. Re
taining Burness at center, Dean has
experimented with the .speedy quin
tet, including Fred Linari and An
derson at forwards, Davidson and
the reliable Bob Wensel at the
guards.
At any rate, all of these boys as
well as Jack Dana, Tiff Denton, at
forwards, and John Alltucker at
guard will probably see action in
the Indians' debut.
There seems to be no drastic
change in the Indians' offense this
year. Again Dean's men will fea
ture that devastating fast break that
ran so many opponents into the floor
last year. This means good back
board work on defense by David
son and especially Cowden and
Burness or Taylor, the quick pass
out to one of the forwards, and the
full court drive to the basket.
DEPENDS ON WILLIAMS
On the slow type of offense, Dean
will depend on the deadly medium
! shooting eyes of Williams and Dav
; idson, the clever ball handling at the
[ pivot spot by Burness, and the
| quick cuts off the block of team
| mates toward the basket for a close-
I in. shot.

full court drive to the basket.
DEPENDS ON WILLIAMS
On the slow type of offense, Dean
will depend on the deadly medium
! shooting eyes of Williams and Dav
; idson, the clever ball handling at the
[ pivot spot by Burness, and the
| quick cuts off the block of team
| mates toward the basket for a close-
I in. shot.
Pre pa red to take over Stanford's
sport spotlight which has for the
last three months been shining on a
bunch of highly successful football
ers. the Cards' 1!»40-41 basketball
team under the guidance of Coach
Everett Dean will open its official
season tonight in the Pavilion at ,X
< clock against Hamline University.
The invaders from Minnesota on
j a barn-storming tour through the
j West lost their first game to De-
Pauw University 26-25 by virtue of a
I last-minute field goal. But Everett
Dean and his cagers are not under
j estimating the Hamline five, which
; has been Minnesota state champions
! for the past nine years.
LINE-UP NOT RELEASED
Although Mr. Dean has not an
nounced any starting line-up as yet
it seems probable that co-Captain
Don Williams and Fordy Anderson
will open at forwards, and co-Cap
tain Kenny Davidson and Bill
Cowden will start at guards. The
only position in doubt is the center
spot, where Don Burness is threat
ening to take over ii# place of last
year's regular, Dick Taylor. Bur
ness, who was a star as a sopho
more but was injured last season, is
pressing the towering Taylor for
starting honors.
j BUT FAST
Another unit on the other hand
specializes in speed and not size. Re
taining Burness at center, Dean has
experimented with the .speedy quin
tet, including Fred Linari and An
derson at forwards, Davidson and
the reliable Bob Wensel at the
guards.
At any rate, all of these boys as
well as Jack Dana, Tiff Denton, at
forwards, and John Alltucker at
guard will probably see action in
the Indians' debut.
There seems to be no drastic
change in the Indians' offense this
year. Again Dean's men will fea
ture that devastating fast break that
ran so many opponents into the floor
last year. This means good back
board work on defense by David
son and especially Cowden and
Burness or Taylor, the quick pass
out to one of the forwards, and the
full court drive to the basket.
