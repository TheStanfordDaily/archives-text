# Indian Soccermen Bow To Cal, 2-1, in Final Tilt
## 
### 
Playing without the watchful eye
and guiding hand of Coach Harry
Maloney, Stanford's varsity soccer
men dropped a 2-1 decision to the
California Bears in their final game
of the year. Coach Maloney, who had
a slight cold at the beginning of the
week, was ordered by his doctor to
miss the game.
The Indians came out fast, and for
a while looked as if they were going
to play their best game of the year.
Alter pounding near the Bear goal
throughout the first quarter, the In
dians tallied early in the second
period.
The Stanford score came off the
toe of co-Captain George LaNicca,
who planted the ball squarely in the
goal from 15 yards out.
This left the Bears undaunted, for
they came right back in the same
second period to score twice and
win the game. Both of the Bear
scores were made against a team
studded with second-stringers, who
were being given a chance to make
a letter.
As in past games the two Cap
tains George Dole and George La-

Nicca played starring roles. Wilson
Clark again displayed the heads-up
play that he has shown all season
and other lighting performances
were turned in by the two fullbacks,
Ned Hugh and Dick Harmon.
Thus did the soccermen end their
1940 season, leaving a record of six
wins, one tie, and three losses. This
team showed a big improvement
over last year's, and was highly suc
cessful in that many of the regu
lars will be back for next year's
eleven.
