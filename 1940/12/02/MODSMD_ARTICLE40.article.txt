T~)EOPLE usually note the rapyd approach of
Jr Finals by the absence of The Daily in front of
the door. One morning they wake up and dis
cover that it's not there. That's a sure sign that
exams will begin in ten days. If they are at all
astute at that hour of the morning they remark
to themselves that ten days is a helluva short
time to pick up all the academic loose-ends.
The Daily should have ceased publication
with its Friday issue. That would have been a
logical and beautiful time to call it quits. Offer
ing up its whole self in fourteen magnificent
pages (just a little late), The Daily should have
lapsed into silence.
But events intervened. For the first time since
1935 the Indians brought the Axe back from
Berkeley. And the Coast Conference courte
ously proffered a Rose Bowl bid. With these
world-shattering happenings, The Daily decided
to vary its routine a little, too. That accounts
for this special issue, all 2,000 green copies of it.
And that means that I have to write one more
editorial before fall quarter publication ends.
In that black fog that follows a convivial week
end, I find it difficult to uncover anything sig
nificant to say. Two important things occurred
-we retrieved the Axe and we definitely will
play in the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day.
Stanford is grateful tor these things. They
were not unexpected but their predictability
didn't alter their value. The comparison be
tween the inept Indians of 1939 and the sensa
tional Indians of 1940 is a satisfying one. And
the thought of being a part, even a little part
as a Stanford rooter, of that gigantic Rose Bowl
spectacle is pleasant. It should add to the en
joyment of New Year's eve and day.
Beyond these few random and unimportant
reflections, it is hard for this writer to manufac
ture any satisfactory essay on the return of the
Axe or the coming game with Nebraska. Every
Stanford man and woman feels strongly about
the former and looks forward to the latter.
The B.A.C.'s ticket arrangements for New
Year's day are more than adequate, from the
student point of view. And the opportunity for
a large number of Stanford men to work as
ticket-takers and program salesmen is an extra
break that should be appreciated. The Rose
Bowl may be manned, we have a feeling, by an
all-Stanford crew.
Disappointment in Texas may be great at the
selection of Nebraska to play against the In
dians. The Southern schools have, it seems, a
fine feeling of co-operation. Friday afternoon
The Daily received this telegram from the Daily
Texan, publication of the University of Texas:
Tradition-inspired Texas team defeated Ag
gies today. Urge you don't overweight defeat
of Southwest's powerhouse in choosing Rose
Bowl opponent. Aggies still number one in
nation in our book."
The best evidence of such a spirit on the
Coast was Cal s between-the-halves card stunt
with the Redskin in the midst of the roses—a
heart-warming gesture from the usually hostile
Bear rooting section.
One pertinent reaction to the return of the
Axe -Stanford didn t have to toss tear gas this
time; we let Frankie Albert toss passes.

cover that it's not there. That's a sure sign that
exams will begin in ten days. If they are at all
astute at that hour of the morning they remark
to themselves that ten days is a helluva short
time to pick up all the academic loose-ends.
The Daily should have ceased publication
with its Friday issue. That would have been a
logical and beautiful time to call it quits. Offer
ing up its whole self in fourteen magnificent
pages (just a little late), The Daily should have
lapsed into silence.
But events intervened. For the first time since
1935 the Indians brought the Axe back from
Berkeley. And the Coast Conference courte
ously proffered a Rose Bowl bid. With these
world-shattering happenings, The Daily decided
to vary its routine a little, too. That accounts
for this special issue, all 2,000 green copies of it.
And that means that I have to write one more
editorial before fall quarter publication ends.
In that black fog that follows a convivial week
end, I find it difficult to uncover anything sig
nificant to say. Two important things occurred
-we retrieved the Axe and we definitely will
play in the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day.
Stanford is grateful tor these things. They
were not unexpected but their predictability
didn't alter their value. The comparison be
tween the inept Indians of 1939 and the sensa
tional Indians of 1940 is a satisfying one. And
the thought of being a part, even a little part
as a Stanford rooter, of that gigantic Rose Bowl
spectacle is pleasant. It should add to the en
joyment of New Year's eve and day.
Beyond these few random and unimportant
reflections, it is hard for this writer to manufac
ture any satisfactory essay on the return of the
Axe or the coming game with Nebraska. Every
Stanford man and woman feels strongly about
the former and looks forward to the latter.
The B.A.C.'s ticket arrangements for New
Year's day are more than adequate, from the
student point of view. And the opportunity for
a large number of Stanford men to work as
ticket-takers and program salesmen is an extra
break that should be appreciated. The Rose
Bowl may be manned, we have a feeling, by an
all-Stanford crew.
Disappointment in Texas may be great at the
selection of Nebraska to play against the In
dians. The Southern schools have, it seems, a
fine feeling of co-operation. Friday afternoon
The Daily received this telegram from the Daily
Texan, publication of the University of Texas:
Tradition-inspired Texas team defeated Ag
gies today. Urge you don't overweight defeat
of Southwest's powerhouse in choosing Rose
Bowl opponent. Aggies still number one in
nation in our book."
The best evidence of such a spirit on the
Coast was Cal s between-the-halves card stunt
with the Redskin in the midst of the roses—a
heart-warming gesture from the usually hostile
Bear rooting section.
One pertinent reaction to the return of the
Axe -Stanford didn t have to toss tear gas this
time; we let Frankie Albert toss passes.
T~)EOPLE usually note the rapyd approach of
Jr Finals by the absence of The Daily in front of
the door. One morning they wake up and dis
cover that it's not there. That's a sure sign that
exams will begin in ten days. If they are at all
astute at that hour of the morning they remark
to themselves that ten days is a helluva short
time to pick up all the academic loose-ends.
