LETS YOU AND HIM FIGHT
IT SEEMS unfair that Stanford should have to be
punished because two other factions are having a
pitch-and-tumble fight.
But that's exactly what has been going on of late.
The two combatants are ASCAP and the National
Broadcasting Company. Stanford is the middle man
in the sandwich. For the information of those who
aii-n't up on the music world. ASCAP is the unionish
organization of American song and lyric writers. They
are so strong and so well organized that the little black
ledger books show that they own over !M) per cent of
all the popular and was-popnlar music played in thes<

United States today. That includes Stanford's bongs
—but more about that later.
There is nothing quite its strong as being strong—
which ultimately leads to showing somebody just
how big your muscles really are. So recently, ASCAP,
Lri a vicious flex of muscles, attempted to up the price
they charged the different broadcasting companies for
broadcasting ASCAP songs over the air.
* * * w
W ELL : sir, the National Broadcasting Company,
which is no puny itself, flexed back, and then
backed up their action. And this where Stanford
comes into the picture.
Their first move was to ban all ASCAP songs from
all unsponsored programs. That was the first step in
NBC's attempt to break the ASCAP monopoly. More
recently NBC has been removing from the airlanes
ASCAP songs which were theme songs for the various
programs.
That is a blow to Stanford since it means that our
hymn, our marching songs can't be played on any un
sponsored programs. Why? Because ASCAP owns
the copyrights to most of our songs. A number of
years ago, Sherman-Clay, in a well-intentioned move,
bought up the rights to our songs when they published
our song book.
As the result of a couple of deals, these rights are
now in ASCAP hands.

IJ U T what makes things worse, starting Jan. 1, 1941,
the National Broadcasting Company will not play
any, not ANY, ASCAP songs over the air whether it's
on sponsored or unsponsored programs.
Again that includes our songs.
And NBC couldn't have picked a worse day on
which to start their purge. For Jan. 1, 1941, happens
to be the day we are playing in the Rose Bowl.
And that means that between the halves, NBC will
not broadcast our swell marching songs. That means
that at the end of the game NBC will not broadcast
our tingling hymn as we stand singing in front of the
other stands.
There will be no, "And now, ladies and gentlemen,
we switch you down to the Rose Bowl field, where the
Stanford band is maneuvering and playing that famous
marching song, 'Come Join the Band'."
There will be none of that—because ASCAP and
NBC are fighting over their marbles. Let's hope they
break it up pretty soon.

An additional note that just couldn't be left out.
All hail last week's Big Game Gaieties. Many say they
were "the best ever in the last four years." Bright
spots were the songs. Previous Gaieties songs have all
gone la-te-da-te-da, and the words of one fitted just
as neatly into the music of another.
Last week's songs showed surprising strength,
Swell.
