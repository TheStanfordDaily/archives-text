## SKY'S THE LIMIT 
### 
r JpIE EDITOR, SIR:
An open letter to all sky playboys: .
Although military airplanes flitting about from
cotton puff to cotton puff on a field of azure may easily
be confused by some as a thing of beauty and a job
forever; it seems to me that there is considerably more
.sky available than that immediately about Mrs. Stan
ford's University for young men and women.
The continuous series of Doppler effects ringing in
one's ears is getting slightly tiresome. So please go
play games somewhere elseâ€”as finals loom up in the
sky like the Hoover Libe.
A. O. N.
