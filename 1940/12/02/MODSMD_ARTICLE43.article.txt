# RUSHING OPEN HOUSES
## 
### 
J<HE EDITOR, SIR:
It seems to*me that the system of rushing is in
Dne respect neither fair to the prospective freshmen,
nor to the fraternities themselves. I refer to the rush
ing of fellows who come here entirely unacquainted
and without friends among the alumni.
During the open house period, we all tried to get
to as many of the houses as we could, and consequently
each house had to see about a hundred fellows or more
each night. How can the fraternities remember the
names of those fellows whom they have not pre
viously sent bids, or of whom they have not heard
previously? Perhaps one in twenty-five will be re
membered. What chance have we who don't know any
fraternity members got?
Wouldn't it be a good idea to have two open house
periods—one for a general survey, and a second for
preference to which we could go unasked in order to
get better acquainted? I believe it would be fairer to
both sides, and I humbly submit this idea for future
classes.
Sincerely yours,
