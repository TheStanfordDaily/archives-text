# WORRY WILL SAVE THE WORLD

EDITOR, SIR:
The whoop and holler of E. G. E. seems to be a
little disconcerting. In his letter about the apathy of
Stanford students, he raises the cry that the provin
cialism of the students is not the attitude that all good
Red. White, and Blue-blooded Americans should take.
He makes the assertion that the students are either
smug or frightened.
After an overlong harangue on ihe subject, E. G. E.
fails to say why he should become inflamed about the
European crisis or how we might go about getting
worked up over it. If he is concerned with the draft
and all of the emergency measures being taken by
the government. I believe it is his own business. Per
sonally, I don't give a damn, because there isn't a
great deal I can do about it, as an individual or as a
member of the student body.
If worrying about European wars and U. S. drafts
will help, I'm ready to start worrying. If there is noth
ing to be done aside from that, I can't see any use
in becoming hysterical. Maybe E. G. E. is just suf
fering from a bad case of "finals nerves."
