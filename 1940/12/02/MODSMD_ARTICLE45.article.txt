# A 						DIFFICULT PROBLEM
## 
### 
r PHE EDITOR, SIR:
We are faced at this time with the difficult prob
lem of selecting a worthy opponent for the Rose Bowl
contest. Such a problem requires the co-operation of
all of us students, so here is our suggestion. Only an
undefeated, outstanding team is worthy of considera
tion, Minnesota and Cornell (we claim Cornell un
defeated and we won't listen to anything you have to
say) are in conferences opposed to post-season games.
Tennessee, and kindred teams, are of the Southern
professional type, and there i r s sentiment against them.
Texas A. & M. was beaten after reading the Dippy's
"Bull Session." Is there any other team in the coun
try with a record worthy of consideration? We find
one that has lost only one game in the past three
years. This year it averaged 28'2 points to its oppo
nents 4 points per game, and finished an undefeated
season. We refer to the Stanford Frosh, Not only are
the Stanford Frosh the only logical choice, but there
are many advantages to such a selection: (1) It would
bring together two of the best coaches in the country—
Clark Shaughnessy and Harry Shipkey; (2) it would
give the Frosh valuable experience and precedent;
(3) Stanford cannot lose; (4) it would then be possible
for certain Stanford players to play four consecutive
years in the Rose Bowl; and (5) Stanford will get the
entire net gate receipts.
Very respectfully yours.
