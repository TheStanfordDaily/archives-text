# Racy Gaieties Production Provides Lots of Laughs
## 
### AUDREY STEELE 
This is a post mortem. We went
to the Gaieties last Friday night and
we're convinced of one thing: If the
word s-e-x wasn't in Mr. Webster's
word-book, would the Gaieties
do for songs, jokes, and general fol
de-rol? We're not prudish, but we
don't like it.
We sat in one of the nice red
plush chairs in the balcony. It was
a neat way to rest up after the rally
and before the game. After we read
the program (which was a good deal
funnier than the show), we were
glad they started on time.
We almost left at the half. But we
didn't, and we're glad of that. The
second part picked up speed and
lile. Maybe it was a psychological
trick. By making the first half so
bad, the second half, which wasn't
anything super-special, looked pret
ty good.
But we'd gone there prepared to
be entertained and we were deter
mined to laugh, if it cracked our
faces. So we broke down on the
between-scene vignettes. Cady's
monotonous appearance became ex
cruciating. Likewise the quip about
the peculiarly-placed stairs amused
us.
Some of the and dancing
was noticeably off key and out-of
step. Seems like the vocalists and
terpsichorists needed their wheaties.
But on the other hand the five hits
and a dent were good and Zelver
silly enough to be funny. Patty

Bouchard can put songs over. Too
bad she didn't have some of the
others to doctor up. Barbara Moore
and Tommy Howard's voices blended
nicely.
You may think we have the post-
Big Game blues. We don't. We're
not even being perverse just for the
sake of it. We had fun and we love
the Gaieties. The Gaieties are as
much a part of the celebration as the
Big Game itself. We only think they
could be improved.

the Gaieties. The Gaieties are as
much a part of the celebration as the
Big Game itself. We only think they
could be improved.
This is a post mortem. We went
to the Gaieties last Friday night and
we're convinced of one thing: If the
word s-e-x wasn't in Mr. Webster's
word-book, would the Gaieties
do for songs, jokes, and general fol
de-rol? We're not prudish, but we
don't like it.
We sat in one of the nice red
plush chairs in the balcony. It was
a neat way to rest up after the rally
and before the game. After we read
the program (which was a good deal
funnier than the show), we were
glad they started on time.
We almost left at the half. But we
didn't, and we're glad of that. The
second part picked up speed and
lile. Maybe it was a psychological
trick. By making the first half so
bad, the second half, which wasn't
anything super-special, looked pret
ty good.
But we'd gone there prepared to
be entertained and we were deter
mined to laugh, if it cracked our
faces. So we broke down on the
between-scene vignettes. Cady's
monotonous appearance became ex
cruciating. Likewise the quip about
the peculiarly-placed stairs amused
us.
Some of the and dancing
was noticeably off key and out-of
step. Seems like the vocalists and
terpsichorists needed their wheaties.
But on the other hand the five hits
and a dent were good and Zelver
silly enough to be funny. Patty

Bouchard can put songs over. Too
bad she didn't have some of the
others to doctor up. Barbara Moore
and Tommy Howard's voices blended
nicely.
You may think we have the post-
Big Game blues. We don't. We're
not even being perverse just for the
sake of it. We had fun and we love
the Gaieties. The Gaieties are as
much a part of the celebration as the
Big Game itself. We only think they
could be improved.
