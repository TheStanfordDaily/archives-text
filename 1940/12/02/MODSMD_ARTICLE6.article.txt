# Farm Lies Low After Big Day
## Axe Comes to Farm After Berkeley Stay 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
Up in Lagunita lake bed there lies
a little pile of charred nibble.
Up at Cal they're wondering what
to do with a broken down goal post.
The Stanford Axe resides in the
Stanford Union showcase.
And black Sunday has faded into j
blue Monday.
In short, Stanford has finished ■
celebrating the biggest Big Game in
many a moon.
TENSE CROWD
Big Game week raids and retalia
tions have blended into an old story.
But not many will soon forget the
charged atmosphei'e that hovered
over Memorial Stadium—not many
will forge that they were hoafs'e
before the game ever started.
From one side of the field roared
taunting chants from the largest
rooting section in the world, and
back rolled answers from the most
determined and the happiest rooting
section in the world.
And after the game was over,
hordes of Stanford men poured onto
the field to have at those goal posts
—previously sawed and ready to
topple. And topple they did. Tri
umphant Stanford marched those
goal posts in front of the California
Bear and let him know who's king
of the mountain.
HANDS OVER AXE
Then, John McPherson handed
over the Axe to a grinning Bruce
Jessup, and eager hands of half a
hundred Stanford men reached up
to take possession. They marched it
across the field to the Stanford side,
and tucked it carefully away in a
B.A.C. chest.
Today the Axe is once again on
display in the Stanford Union show
case for the first time since 1935. In
1933 Stanford established the Axe
as a trophy to be awarded the win
ner of the annual Big Game. It re
mained on the Farm until the year
after the graduation of the Vowing
Sophomores.
Today Stanford men are nursing
bruises and finding Stanford women
to mend torn shirts and pants, for
"Clafk Shaughnessy's Wow Boys won
the Big Game.
Anel Stanford men brought back

Anel Stanford men brought back
i the Axe.
Up in Lagunita lake bed there lies
a little pile of charred nibble.
Up at Cal they're wondering what
to do with a broken down goal post.
The Stanford Axe resides in the
Stanford Union showcase.
And black Sunday has faded into j
blue Monday.
In short, Stanford has finished ■
celebrating the biggest Big Game in
many a moon.
TENSE CROWD
Big Game week raids and retalia
tions have blended into an old story.
But not many will soon forget the
charged atmosphei'e that hovered
over Memorial Stadium—not many
will forge that they were hoafs'e
before the game ever started.
From one side of the field roared
taunting chants from the largest
rooting section in the world, and
back rolled answers from the most
determined and the happiest rooting
section in the world.
And after the game was over,
hordes of Stanford men poured onto
the field to have at those goal posts
—previously sawed and ready to
topple. And topple they did. Tri
umphant Stanford marched those
goal posts in front of the California
Bear and let him know who's king
of the mountain.
HANDS OVER AXE
Then, John McPherson handed
over the Axe to a grinning Bruce
Jessup, and eager hands of half a
hundred Stanford men reached up
to take possession. They marched it
across the field to the Stanford side,
and tucked it carefully away in a
B.A.C. chest.
Today the Axe is once again on
display in the Stanford Union show
case for the first time since 1935. In
1933 Stanford established the Axe
as a trophy to be awarded the win
