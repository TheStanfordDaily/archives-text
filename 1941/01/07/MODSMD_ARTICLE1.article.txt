### BOB LOW 
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT yes
terday asked the people of the
United States to make America an
"arsenal" for the democratic coun
tries of the world which would re
sist aggression. His words outlined
clearly the policy of the government
of the United States in a world torn
by war.
That the words of the President
expressed a policy favored by a ma
jority of the people is unquestion
able. However, there remains an
articulate and powerful minority
that is fighting this course at every
turn. The place of this group can
not be overlooked, but as the year
1940 passes into history it might be
interesting to review the majority
trend that seems to come to a head
in the President's message.
* * *
1 AST year at this time, Congress
was fighting over revision of the
Neutrality Act. America, in other
words, still had not outwardly de
cided to aid Britain and France.
Isolationism was a powerful force.
Spokesmen for the Administration
urged the Congress to take notice of
the dangers confronting the nation—
of our tremendous stake in the out
come of the European war. Yet,
many looked across the Atlantic at
what to them seemed like a "phoney"
war.
Slowly the majority of Americans
were stirred—first by the invasion of
Finland and then by the invasion of
the Low Countries.
And then abruptly the majority
of Americans awakened when
France fell and the British Isles
themselves were threatened with
invasion.
The American Congress reflected
the will of the majority when it
enacted a stupendous national de
fense program and then carried
through a compulsory selective serv
ice bill over the opposition of an in
creasingly smaller but increasingly
more articulate minority.
Since the outbreak of the Euro
pean war in September 1939, Amer
ica has undergone a deep change—
slowly, at first, and then with as
tounding rapidity after the defeat of
France.
And what is most amazing is that
the greater part of this change took
place in some six months—between
the fall of France and the Presi
dent's message yesterday.

I TP TO the message yesterday, the
American people knew of no
definite policy but only that one
was evolving. Yesterday the foreign
policy of the United States was of
ficially announced.
We are openly committed to
give all aid short of man-power
to Great Britain and to any other
nation that resists Axis aggres
sion. This means that internally
the United States must assume a
full-fledged war economy.
But the American people are slow
to recognize the full significance of
this policy. The draft affected some,
impressing to some degree the grav
ity of the situation. But the arma
ment has meant prosperity or good
times for many more.
A war economy demands sacrifices
from all, and this is the aspect of
the present program that a large
number of Americans as yet do not
understand.

A majority wish Britain to win
the war, and agree that America
should aid with her tremendous re
sources.

Referring to the armament pro
gram in his talk before Congress
yesterday, President Roosevelt said
that he was "not satisfied with the
progress thus far made." He did not
attribute his dissatisfaction to lack
of confidence in the men who are in
charge of the program.

He intimated that more sacrifices
must be made if the policy of the
Administration, approved by a ma
jority of the people, is to be more
than a political platform.
