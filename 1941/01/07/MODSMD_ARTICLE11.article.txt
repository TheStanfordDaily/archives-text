# Farm Enrollment Falls Slightly As Stanford Enters Fiftieth Year
## Late Students Swell General Fund by $1,144 
### 
With the sizeable sum of $1,144 in
late fines jingling in what Registrar
J. Pearce Mitchell calls the "gen
eral fund." Stanford University yes
terday opened its long - sought,
much-publicized Fiftieth Year with
aching heads, rain, and a decided
drop in total registrations.
The Administration's books, at
closing time last night, showed a
total of 4,097 registered for winter
quarter's wet weather as compared
with last year's total of 4,122 —a de
crease of 25.
WOMEN FALL OFF
This decrease leans heavily to the
feminine side, since the tabulations
show only three less men as com
pared with 22 less women.
Most outstanding total, however,
was this year's late registrations due
to Rose Bowl and flu trouble. At the
end of official registration day, Fri
day, 567 fewer students had regis
tered than last year at the end of
the first day. At the end of the
second day, 572 less than last year
had registered.
SAME OLD STORY
"Oh, we're not surprised. This
happened the last time we went to
the Rose Bowl," said Miss Cook
through the Administration Build
ing's information window. "No, I
can't tell you how many registered
today; they are still pouring in."
All of which has plinked at least
$1,144 into the University treasury.
Any still-later registrants tomorrow
will have to pay an increased fine of
$3 instead of the $2 fine for Saturday
and yesterday. Such registrations
will increase the $1,144 total.
