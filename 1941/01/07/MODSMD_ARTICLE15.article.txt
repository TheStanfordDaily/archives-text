# Wilbur Ends First 25 Years As President
## 
### JANET GOULD 
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur finished
his first 25 years as President of
Stanford January 1, 1941, as the
United States and the University
prepared again for the war, watched
world patterns change—while Stan
ford men and women "remain the
same."
Drawing from his experiences as
Secretary of the Interior, president
of the American Medical Associa
tion, chairman of the board of Insti
tute of Pacific Relations and of the
Association for American College
Presidents, and head man of the
Farm, Dr. Wilbur said yesterday
that Ihere had been changes in the
world and in the university environ
ment, but "very little change in the
students."
PRAISES STUDENTS
"They still have the same wide
awakeness," the President declared.
"I realized the difference when I
went to Washington in 1929, and had
older audiences, less intci'estcd in
things.
"Today there is the same high
quality of students. Approve of
them? Yes, or I wouldn't be here'."
Dr. Wilbur took office as Presi
dent Jan. 1, 1916, just when, he said,
Woodrow Wilson had been re-elect
ed to keep the nation out of war, and
Stanford students were trying to
solve the same problems that face
them today. Asked if he dared pre
dict 1941 reactions in the light of
his observations, the President re
plied:
"It's in the lap of the gods. You
can't say what you are going to do
or what you are not going to do.
You may not want trouble, but if
somebody comes along and knocks
your wife down, you find yourself
in trouble. That's the way it is to
day."
STUDIED AIHiOAD
Dr. Wilbur graduated from Stan
ford in 189(5 and received his M.D.
in 1897. From there he was a stu
dent of medicine in London and
Munich, taught in universities from
Arizona to Porto Rico, and was dean
of the Stanford School of Medicine
from 1911 to 1916, when he became
President of the University.
As President of Stanford, Dr. Wil
bur saw his faculty and the Univer
sity appropriations more than treble
and watched the student body be
come almost double the enrollment
of 19J6. As an author he published
many articles upon questions under
his jurisdiction as Secretary of the
Interior under Herbert Hoover and
upon Pacific relations. In the last
four years he has written four books:
"Stanford Horizons" in 1936; "Mflrch
of Medicine" in 19118; "Hoover Poli
cies" in 1937; and, just this fall, "Hu
man Hopes," a compilation of ad
dresses and essays on education,
soical service, and hygiene.

the globe except arctic and antarc-

his jurisdiction as Secretary of the
Interior under Herbert Hoover and
upon Pacific relations. In the last
four years he has written four books:
"Stanford Horizons" in 1936; "Mflrch
of Medicine" in 19118; "Hoover Poli

Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur finished
his first 25 years as President of
Stanford January 1, 1941, as the
United States and the University
prepared again for the war, watched
world patterns change—while Stan
ford men and women "remain the
same."
Drawing from his experiences as
Secretary of the Interior, president
of the American Medical Associa
tion, chairman of the board of Insti
tute of Pacific Relations and of the
Association for American College
Presidents, and head man of the
Farm, Dr. Wilbur said yesterday
that Ihere had been changes in the
world and in the university environ
ment, but "very little change in the
students."
PRAISES STUDENTS
"They still have the same wide
awakeness," the President declared.
"I realized the difference when I
went to Washington in 1929, and had
older audiences, less intci'estcd in
things.
"Today there is the same high
quality of students. Approve of
them? Yes, or I wouldn't be here'."
Dr. Wilbur took office as Presi
dent Jan. 1, 1916, just when, he said,
Woodrow Wilson had been re-elect
ed to keep the nation out of war, and
Stanford students were trying to
solve the same problems that face
them today. Asked if he dared pre
dict 1941 reactions in the light of
his observations, the President re
plied:
"It's in the lap of the gods. You
can't say what you are going to do
or what you are not going to do.
You may not want trouble, but if
somebody comes along and knocks
your wife down, you find yourself
in trouble. That's the way it is to
day."
STUDIED AIHiOAD
Dr. Wilbur graduated from Stan
ford in 189(5 and received his M.D.
in 1897. From there he was a stu
dent of medicine in London and
Munich, taught in universities from
Arizona to Porto Rico, and was dean
of the Stanford School of Medicine
from 1911 to 1916, when he became
President of the University.
As President of Stanford, Dr. Wil
bur saw his faculty and the Univer
sity appropriations more than treble
and watched the student body be
come almost double the enrollment
of 19J6. As an author he published
many articles upon questions under
his jurisdiction as Secretary of the
