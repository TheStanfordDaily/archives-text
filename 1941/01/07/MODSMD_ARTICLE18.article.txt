# F.R. Pledges U.S. Against Axis Powers
## President Roosevelt Asks Congress to Give Billions for Allied Aid 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 0 (UP). —
Pr< .idcnt Roosevelt today firmly re
j< < t< d the theory of United States
isolation from t lie international
crisis and asked Congress to vote
billions in war aid to the democra
cies which are fighting the "new
order of tyranny" of the Axis
powers.
Appearing before a joint session
of the new Congress to report on
the state of the union, the Presi
dent was applauded loudly and
often as he flayed the methods and
motives of dietators, pledged all-out
aid to Great Britain, Greece and
China, and promised unrelenting op
position to any peace "dictated by
a;;- l essors and sponsored by ap
peasers."
p.m:si;nts motto
Mr. Roosevelt was emphatic in his
iii istence that the United States aid
foreign nations fighting to keep their
fieedom. He recommended that this
motto be adopted in relation to those
countries:
"We Americans are vitally in
terested in your defense of free
dom.
"We are putting forth our en
ergies, our resources, and our or
ganizing powers to give you the
strength to regain and maintain a
free world. We shall send you in
ever - increasing numbers of ships,
planes, tanks and guns.
"This is our purpose and our
pledge."
The President's plan, proposing,
in effect, unlimited credits to
Britain and other nations resist
ing "aggression," envisioned re
payment "with a reasonable time
following the close of hostilities, in
similar materials, or, at our opin
ion, in other goods of many kinds
which they can produce and which
we need."
NO INTIMIDATION
He also made it plain that this
government will not be intimidated
in fulfillment of this purpose by
threats from dictators. Such aid, he
insisted, is not an act of war even if
a dictator should "unilaterally pro
claim it so to be."
"When the dictators are ready to
make war upon us," he said, "they
will not wait for an act of war on
our part. They did not wait for
Norway 01* Belgium or the Nether
lands to commit an act of war.
THREAT FROM WITHIN
Because of the fifth-column threat,
he declared that all of this country's
d' fense problems now must be con
sidered as part of the great emer
gency on which all national effort
must be centered. First need, he as
serted, is a "swift and driving in
crease in armament production"
which will bring "quicker and bet
ter results."
"1 am not satisfied with the prog
ress thus far made," he said. "The
men in charge of the program rep
resent the best in training, ability
and patriotism. They are not satis
fied with the progress thus far
made. None of us will be satisfied
until the job is done."

The President's plan, proposing,
in effect, unlimited credits to
Britain and other nations resist
ing "aggression," envisioned re
payment "with a reasonable time
following the close of hostilities, in
similar materials, or, at our opin
ion, in other goods of many kinds
which they can produce and which
we need."
NO INTIMIDATION
He also made it plain that this
government will not be intimidated
in fulfillment of this purpose by
threats from dictators. Such aid, he
insisted, is not an act of war even if
a dictator should "unilaterally pro
claim it so to be."
"When the dictators are ready to
make war upon us," he said, "they
will not wait for an act of war on
our part. They did not wait for
Norway 01* Belgium or the Nether
lands to commit an act of war.
THREAT FROM WITHIN
Because of the fifth-column threat,
he declared that all of this country's
d' fense problems now must be con
sidered as part of the great emer
gency on which all national effort
must be centered. First need, he as
serted, is a "swift and driving in
crease in armament production"
which will bring "quicker and bet
ter results."
"1 am not satisfied with the prog
ress thus far made," he said. "The
men in charge of the program rep
resent the best in training, ability
and patriotism. They are not satis
fied with the progress thus far
made. None of us will be satisfied
until the job is done."
