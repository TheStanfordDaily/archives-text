# Farm Chemists in a Lather Attempting to Analyze Soap
## 
### 
Soap as a cleansing agent lias been used for a long time, but why it
cleans is the problem the Stanford chemistry department and Dr. J. W.
Mcßain, professor of chemistry, are trying to solve. Research is now cen
tered around means of dyeing new synthetic fabrics and the study of
the formation of carbon on automobile cylinders.

| Scientists are studying dyeing
j prevention of the formation of car
| bon with the thought that the right |
cleaning agent detergent ought to j
make any substance soluble in any
solvent.
The Stanford research is directed ]
at the physical structure of soap.
When changing from a solid to a
liquid upon being heated, soap
passes through five distinct forms.
The research group wants to know
what the chemical nature of these
forms is.
By studying photographs of the
I basic structure of soap, Dr. Mcßain
i hopes that eventually the individual
molecules may be photographed
with every atom showing. If this
can be brought about, the secret
lying behind soap's powers may
finally be discovered.
