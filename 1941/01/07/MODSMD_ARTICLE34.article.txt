Remember those cards for the stunts at Rose Iiowl?
Over 1,750 sets—7,ooo cards—and they didn't get there by magic. While
Stanfordites watched the parade or were comfortable in warm beds, mem
bers of the Rally Committee were going up and down the 50 rows tacking
on the cards. They began at 8:30 and finished after 12 o'clock.
Nor was this the most difficult part of the work. The stunts had to
be planned; then sketched in mniiaturc on graph paper, with every

square representing a seat.
tough job follows: the color of the
cards must be indicated on each in
struction card and this must be done
for each individual stunt.
For the Rose Bowl game there
were 10 stunts and 11 additional
parts to be performed by 1,750 root
ers. Rally Committee, thus, went
through the 1,750 instruction cards
21 times—34,7so in all, to mark in
the required color. And then each
stunt had to be checked against the
graph sketch. Finally, the cards
were placed at the correct row and
seat.
To prepare the stunts for the Bowl,
committee members remained on
campus two days after exams and
details were handled by members
living in Los Angeles.
The most important function of
the service group is to plan rallies—
arrange for speakers, stunts, and ad
vertising. Train rallies and parades
are planned by the committee, and
it is in charge of student seating at
football games.
In the past the committee's duties
usually ended with the last, grid
game. However, Bill Kimball and
Pat Smith, this year's co-chairmen,
have indicated that the group will
participate in preparation for Stan
ford's Fiftieth Anniversary Celebra
tion.
