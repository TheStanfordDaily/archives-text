Editorial comment on the Presi
dent's state of the Union message:
Chicago Daily Tribune—The Presi
dent revealed himself ... to be in
an excited frame of mind. The text,
filled as it is with alarms, hasty gen
eralizations, contradictions, and
threats to Europeans and Americans
alike, is not the work of a man
facing a situation dispassionately.
New York Daily News—The Pres
ident seemed vague to us on the
extent of our war aims. ... If a
return to the status quo as of the
day before Hitler tore into Poland
is the eventual British war aim and
is to be ours likewise, then from all
signs now visible we'd better resign
ourselves to the prospect of a war
or series of wars as long and bitter
as the Napoleonic wars.
New York Times — There cannot
be the slightest doubt that the course
to which Mr. Roosevelt pledged this
country yesterday has the endorse
ment of the vast majority of our
people, and that they will approve
whatever measures are needed to put
it into practice. In an hour of great
crisis the President has spoken to
the nation with candor and with
foresight.
The Dallas Morning News — The
President has indisputably declared
war on the totalitarian powers and
asks Congress to support the con
flict with the weapon now at hand,
aid to Britain.

1941 Orange Week celebration.
