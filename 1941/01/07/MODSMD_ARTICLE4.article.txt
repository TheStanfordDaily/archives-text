# Make-up Exams Due by June
## New Rules Issued For Flu Incompletes 
### 
The Committee on Scholarship has
issued a new set of regulations gov
erning the making up of incom
pletes because of last quarter's in
fluenza epidemic. The following
rules will go into effect:

"Although University regulations
allow students four quarters in
which to make up "incompletes," it
seems advisable under the circum
stances that the grades be made up
as soon as possible. For scholarship
purposes the Committee on Schol
arship has voted to ignore the "in
completes" up to the end of the
spring quarter, but that any grades
not made up by that time will have
the same effect as if they were fail
ures.

"This means that although a
student actually has four quarters
in residence in which to make up
the incompletes, he runs the risk
of incurring scholarship action (in
the case of Lower Division stu
dents) after the expiration of two
quarters if the work is not made
up then.
"It is hoped that during the
winter and spring quarters in
structors will set dates as early as
convenient when make-up exami
nations will he given. The Com
mittee on Scholarship will accept
make-ups even if they occur dur
ing the first three weeks of the
quarter. Any instructor wishing
to give his make-up examinations
before the published dates (Janu
ary 2:5 to March 21) may feel free
to do so.
"It is suggested that instructors
post notices on the departmental
bulletin boards giving the course
number, date, hour and place of each
make-up examination.
"The Registrar's Office will be
glad to answer questions regarding
general regulations governing "in
completes."
