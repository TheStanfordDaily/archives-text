# Cards Swamp San Diego
## Cage Stars Swish Up 52-29 Score 
### DON SELBY 
With sharp-shooting Don Williams
hitting the hoop for a total of 1(5
points, Stanford rolled over San
Diego State—the team that defeated
Cal last week—by a 52-2!) score in
the Pavilion last night.
Closely pressing his running mate
at forward for high-scoring honors
was Fordy Anderson, who tallied 11
points, while Forward Phelps of San
Diego led the losers in the scoring
column with (5 points.
The tricky ball-handling of Coach
Everett Dean's starting five, al
though it wasn't as smooth as usual,
baffled the Staters sufficiently to al
low the Indians to break into the
hole for set-ups time and again.
TOOK LEAD EARLY
Ringing up 14 points before their
opponents had tallied a single field
goal, the Indians jumped into an
early lead which they stretched to
2(5 points at one time in the game.
The cosest San Diego could come to
closing the gap after the first ten
minutes of play was 11 points.
Don Williams gave evidence that
he is going to be a tough man to
keep out of the scoring columns
when the conference season rolls
around with his dead-eye shooting
from the floor. He hit the hoop for
six field goals, which is good shoot
ing in tiny man's league. The re
mainder of his total points came
from the four free throws he made
good out of six attempts.
The outcome of the game was
never in doubt, although San Diego's
Sell wood, Echle, and Hale hit for
consecutive field goals just before
the gun ended the first half.
NO LETDOWN
Immediately after the second half
got under way Anderson popped a
20-footer, which was followed by
Kenny Davidson's tip-in. Then An
derson rang the bell three times in
a row, once from 15 feet out and
twice from under the bucket, and
Bill Cowden and Davidson followed
with field goals that sent the Indians
way out in front.
Although Coach Dean sent in a
string of substitutes that cleared the
bench, the scoring parade didn't let
up at the end of the game as Jack
Dana and Ed Voss, a pair of flashy
looking sophomores, each tallied a
field goal and Chuck Smith added a
point with a charity toss.
Smith, by the way, wore Num
ber 7 jersey, formerly worn by the
immortal Hank Luisetti —the player
whom Ex Committee last year voted
to honor by putting his jersey in
moth balls for all time to come.
BURN ESS LOOKS OKAY
From the looks of his work around
the post, Don Burness has com
pletely overcome the knee injury
which kept him out of competition
all last season, and his teamwork
with Williams and Anderson makes
the trio a unit that gives promise of
being the smoothest on the Coast be
fore the season is over.
An important factor in Stanford's
easy win over the Staters was the
backboard work of the Indian
guards, Davidson and Cowden,

derson rang the bell three times in
a row, once from 15 feet out and
twice from under the bucket, and
Bill Cowden and Davidson followed
with field goals that sent the Indians
way out in front.
Although Coach Dean sent in a
string of substitutes that cleared the
bench, the scoring parade didn't let
up at the end of the game as Jack
Dana and Ed Voss, a pair of flashy
looking sophomores, each tallied a
field goal and Chuck Smith added a
point with a charity toss.
Smith, by the way, wore Num
ber 7 jersey, formerly worn by the
immortal Hank Luisetti —the player
whom Ex Committee last year voted
to honor by putting his jersey in
moth balls for all time to come.
BURN ESS LOOKS OKAY
From the looks of his work around
the post, Don Burness has com
pletely overcome the knee injury
which kept him out of competition
all last season, and his teamwork
with Williams and Anderson makes
the trio a unit that gives promise of
being the smoothest on the Coast be
fore the season is over.
An important factor in Stanford's
easy win over the Staters was the
backboard work of the Indian
guards, Davidson and Cowden,

TAMPA, Fla., Jan. 6 (UP).—A
glimpse of what's in the cards for
the amateur tennis world in 1941
was in prospect today with the open
ing of the Dixie tournament in
which the top three men players of
the country are competing. These
players are Riggs, McNeill, and Ko
vacs.
PORTLAND, Ore. (UP).- Racing
of midget automobiles ranging
around 20 inches in length and
powered by tiny gasoline engines
has made its appearance in Port
land. The racers hold meets each
week-end.
With sharp-shooting Don Williams
hitting the hoop for a total of 1(5
points, Stanford rolled over San
Diego State—the team that defeated
Cal last week—by a 52-2!) score in
the Pavilion last night.
Closely pressing his running mate
at forward for high-scoring honors
was Fordy Anderson, who tallied 11
points, while Forward Phelps of San
Diego led the losers in the scoring
column with (5 points.
The tricky ball-handling of Coach
Everett Dean's starting five, al
though it wasn't as smooth as usual,
baffled the Staters sufficiently to al
low the Indians to break into the
hole for set-ups time and again.
TOOK LEAD EARLY
Ringing up 14 points before their
opponents had tallied a single field
goal, the Indians jumped into an
early lead which they stretched to
2(5 points at one time in the game.
The cosest San Diego could come to
closing the gap after the first ten
minutes of play was 11 points.
Don Williams gave evidence that
he is going to be a tough man to
keep out of the scoring columns
when the conference season rolls
around with his dead-eye shooting
from the floor. He hit the hoop for
six field goals, which is good shoot
ing in tiny man's league. The re
mainder of his total points came
from the four free throws he made
good out of six attempts.
The outcome of the game was
never in doubt, although San Diego's
Sell wood, Echle, and Hale hit for
consecutive field goals just before
the gun ended the first half.
NO LETDOWN
Immediately after the second half
got under way Anderson popped a
20-footer, which was followed by
Kenny Davidson's tip-in. Then An
derson rang the bell three times in
a row, once from 15 feet out and

TAMPA, Fla., Jan. 6 (UP).—A
glimpse of what's in the cards for
the amateur tennis world in 1941
was in prospect today with the open
ing of the Dixie tournament in
which the top three men players of
the country are competing. These
players are Riggs, McNeill, and Ko
vacs.
PORTLAND, Ore. (UP).- Racing
of midget automobiles ranging
around 20 inches in length and
powered by tiny gasoline engines
has made its appearance in Port
land. The racers hold meets each
week-end.
With sharp-shooting Don Williams
hitting the hoop for a total of 1(5
points, Stanford rolled over San
Diego State—the team that defeated
Cal last week—by a 52-2!) score in
the Pavilion last night.
Closely pressing his running mate
at forward for high-scoring honors
was Fordy Anderson, who tallied 11
points, while Forward Phelps of San
Diego led the losers in the scoring
column with (5 points.
The tricky ball-handling of Coach
Everett Dean's starting five, al
though it wasn't as smooth as usual,
baffled the Staters sufficiently to al
low the Indians to break into the
hole for set-ups time and again.
TOOK LEAD EARLY
Ringing up 14 points before their
opponents had tallied a single field
goal, the Indians jumped into an
early lead which they stretched to
2(5 points at one time in the game.
The cosest San Diego could come to
closing the gap after the first ten
minutes of play was 11 points.
Don Williams gave evidence that
he is going to be a tough man to
keep out of the scoring columns
when the conference season rolls
around with his dead-eye shooting
from the floor. He hit the hoop for
six field goals, which is good shoot
ing in tiny man's league. The re
mainder of his total points came
from the four free throws he made
good out of six attempts.
The outcome of the game was
never in doubt, although San Diego's
Sell wood, Echle, and Hale hit for
consecutive field goals just before
the gun ended the first half.
NO LETDOWN
Immediately after the second half
got under way Anderson popped a
20-footer, which was followed by
Kenny Davidson's tip-in. Then An
derson rang the bell three times in
a row, once from 15 feet out and
twice from under the bucket, and
Bill Cowden and Davidson followed
with field goals that sent the Indians
way out in front.
Although Coach Dean sent in a
string of substitutes that cleared the
bench, the scoring parade didn't let
up at the end of the game as Jack
Dana and Ed Voss, a pair of flashy
looking sophomores, each tallied a
field goal and Chuck Smith added a
point with a charity toss.
Smith, by the way, wore Num
ber 7 jersey, formerly worn by the
immortal Hank Luisetti —the player
whom Ex Committee last year voted
to honor by putting his jersey in
moth balls for all time to come.
BURN ESS LOOKS OKAY
From the looks of his work around
the post, Don Burness has com
pletely overcome the knee injury
which kept him out of competition
all last season, and his teamwork
with Williams and Anderson makes
the trio a unit that gives promise of
being the smoothest on the Coast be
fore the season is over.
An important factor in Stanford's
easy win over the Staters was the
backboard work of the Indian
guards, Davidson and Cowden,
