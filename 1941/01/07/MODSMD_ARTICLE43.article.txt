will be a definite threat for a start
;ng post off the Indian varsity next
season.
CENTER COPS HONORS
Dick Sourikoff, Sacramento cen
ter, managed to cop the high scor
ing honors for the game in spite of
the poor passing and ragged team
work of his mates and led Middleton
r ind Wreisner in the race for indi
vidual honors by one point when
the final gun sounded. ,
The frosh were handicapped by
•be loss of Bud Madden and Fred
Oliver due to scholastic difficulties,
ind will be without their services
for the entire season. Lee had
counted heavily on this oair of tall
boys to team with Middleton to
•five the freshmen a strong forward
wall.
Individual scores contributed by
frosh players included: Hooper, 6;
McCann, 2; Middleton, 9; Wreisner,
9; and Halstead, 4.
Combining a fast-breaking offense with clever ball-handling, "Becbs"
Lee's frosh basketball team managed to trounce a strong Sacramento
Junior College team last night in the preliminary to the varsity game.
Led by Dick Middlcton and Bob Wreisner, who tanked nine points each,
the frosh led 16-14 af half time and were never in serious trouble during
the second half.
The Card frosh showed themselves to be well versed in fundamentals
and tiid some fine work on rebounds. Bill Hooper, ace fresh guard, showed
himself to be one of the best frosh

rebound men to play in the pavilion
in several years, as he consistently
controlled the backboard and played
a general "ball-hawk" game.
McCANN STEALS BALL
Frank McCann, freshman forward,
and Bill Halstead, alternate guard,
managed to steal the ball with al
most clocklike regularity during the
fading moments of the contest as
the ragged passing of the visiting
squad became worse in the last hectic
few minutes of the game. John
Hage, frosh guard, v/ho has just re
covered from influenza, entered the
->ame only for a few minutes during
'he second half, but showed that he
will be a definite threat for a start
;ng post off the Indian varsity next
season.
