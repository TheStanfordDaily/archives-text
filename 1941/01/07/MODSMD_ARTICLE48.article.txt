# Baseball Dope For New Year
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 6 (UP).—Base
ball potpourri: Henry Edwards, pub
licity man of the American League,
finally has come through with the
news we've been waiting for since
October—"The Boston Red Sox were
in first place 57 days in 1949, 20
more days than Detroit, which won
the pennant, and five more days
than Cleveland, which finished sec
ond." . . . And then Henry spoils
it all by adding: "But they pay off
on the club that's first at the fini
ish." . . . Having forecast the de
cline of the Yanks and picked the
Red Sox as their successors, we at
least were shooting in the direction
of the bull's eye . . . and outside the
pitching box the Red Sox had the
best club in the American League
last year but unfortunately in that
important matter of chucking Joe
Cronin's boys were close to the worst.
PITCHING TIP
Here's a tip: Watch Jimmy Wil
son work wonders with Bill Lee
and Dizzy Dean of the Cubs . . .
Dizzy idolizes Wilson and if there's
any pitching left in his right arm
Wilson will get it out for the Cubs.
. . . The Reds did not ask the Yan
kees for any physical reports on
Monte Pearson before they boughl
the veteran righthander . . . Ed
Dariow told Warren Giles that
Pearson was okay physically and
Darrow's word was good enough for
the Reds' boss.
CATCHER SPEAKS
Eirdie Tebbetts, Tigers' catcher,
says he can't recall ever having bis>n
struck out by Bob Feller, a state
ment he may uegret. Dick Bartell
said about the same thing once
when he was with the Giants follow
ing a spring tour with the Indians.
. . . . Since then Bartell hasn't made
many loud fouls off Bullet Bob.
MORE DOPE
Hal Trosky and MeJ Harder arc
the only two Indians who were
with Cleveland when Roger Peck
inpaugh managed the club in 1933.
. . . Outfielder Jim Mallory, signed
by Washington as a free agent, is a
former football star at North Caro
lina. . . . Dizzy Trout, Tigers' pitch
er, who wore spectacles last sea
son, is now wearing the new con
tact lenses which are adjusted to
the eyeballs. ... If they prove a
success it will mean a boon to
players with weak eyes.
