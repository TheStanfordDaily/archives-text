T3ICKING up what might be called the loose ends after a month of more
«tr less blissful silence on the part of Slants.
There seems to be a stereotyped reaction to the ever present question,
"What did you think of the game?" It consists mainly of incoherent
gurgling sounds issuing at machine-gun tempo from an open mouth,
accompanied by disconnected hand motions and frequently by circular
rotation of the auditory appendages.
Even the Los Angeles newspapers, which usually have a tendency to
discredit anything remotely connected with the better half of this fair
state, broke down and scattered superlatives plentifully over the sport
pages.
And those Indian and Cornhusker gridders really deserved all the
typographical bouquets thrown their way. The spectacular battle they
put on probably wasn't the over-all most thrilling encounter in the
history of the classic, as as some over-enthusiastic writers stated, but as
an exhibition of wide-open, hell-for-leather gridiron pyrotechnics, I
don't think you'll tincl anything to surpass it in the annals of college
football.

HPHROUGHOUT the country "T Formation" is beginning to symbolize
hocus pocus and black magic. A legend of invincibility has grown up,
mainly because of the success enjoyed by Stanford and the Chicago Bears
during the past season.
That the T Formation is infallible is now one of the major delusions
to which sports fans fall prey every once in a while. Frankly, it's hooey.
The basic offensive formation that has raised Clark Shaughnessy
and George Ilaias to the top of the gridiron ladder with this year is
not the real reason fcr the successes of their two teams.
Granting that it makes possible a widely diversified, fast-hitting at
tack, the T alone is not enough to make a championship football team.
The most important requisite is still good football players. Perhaps a given
group of football players would be more successful working from the T
than from a single or double wing back because of the variety of plays
possible, but Stanford's success this year can be traced directly to a fine
bunch of football players molded into a great team by a smart coach.
The role of the T Formation wasn't incidental, but it was far from
I the most important factor.

After reading in the papers all fall that the Chicago Bears used
the same offense that our Indians employed, it was quite a surprise to
see the pro champs in action against the National League All-Stars
in Los Angeles.
The formation was the same all right, but the idea and execution of
the offense was entirely different. There's almost as wide a gap between
Stanford and Chicago T Formations as there is between the Notre Dame
and Warner systems.
The Bears generate terrific power through the line to roll up yards.
Their backs are fast as well as big, but the Bears show little of the blind
ing speed Hugh Gallarneau and Pete Kmetovic furnish the Indians. The
polished deception that Stanford has employed so successfully is almost
entirely lacking from the Bear offense.

The Intercollegiate Football Rules Committee adopted three changes to
give football coaches something to think about in their spare time during
the months before the next season opens.
The first, intended mainly to benefit the smaller teams, does away
with restrictions on substitutions, a player may re-enter the game at
any time his coach pleases.
The second permits a substitute to talk without penalty before a play
has been run following his entry into the game. Thus a coach, if he wants
to, can send information into the fray at any time.
The last makes a fourth down pass over the goal line that is incom
plete the same as any other incompleted pass, instead of giving the other
team the ball on the 20-yard line on a touchback.

That the T Formation is infallible is now one of the major delusions

possible, but Stanford's success this year can be traced directly to a fine

There seems to be a stereotyped reaction to the ever present question,

put on probably wasn't the over-all most thrilling encounter in the

HPHROUGHOUT the country "T Formation" is beginning to symbolize
hocus pocus and black magic. A legend of invincibility has grown up,
mainly because of the success enjoyed by Stanford and the Chicago Bears
during the past season.
That the T Formation is infallible is now one of the major delusions
to which sports fans fall prey every once in a while. Frankly, it's hooey.
The basic offensive formation that has raised Clark Shaughnessy
and George Ilaias to the top of the gridiron ladder with this year is
not the real reason fcr the successes of their two teams.
Granting that it makes possible a widely diversified, fast-hitting at
tack, the T alone is not enough to make a championship football team.
The most important requisite is still good football players. Perhaps a given
group of football players would be more successful working from the T
than from a single or double wing back because of the variety of plays
possible, but Stanford's success this year can be traced directly to a fine
bunch of football players molded into a great team by a smart coach.
The role of the T Formation wasn't incidental, but it was far from
I the most important factor.

After reading in the papers all fall that the Chicago Bears used
the same offense that our Indians employed, it was quite a surprise to
see the pro champs in action against the National League All-Stars
in Los Angeles.
The formation was the same all right, but the idea and execution of
the offense was entirely different. There's almost as wide a gap between
Stanford and Chicago T Formations as there is between the Notre Dame
and Warner systems.
The Bears generate terrific power through the line to roll up yards.
Their backs are fast as well as big, but the Bears show little of the blind
ing speed Hugh Gallarneau and Pete Kmetovic furnish the Indians. The
polished deception that Stanford has employed so successfully is almost
entirely lacking from the Bear offense.

The Intercollegiate Football Rules Committee adopted three changes to
give football coaches something to think about in their spare time during
the months before the next season opens.
The first, intended mainly to benefit the smaller teams, does away
with restrictions on substitutions, a player may re-enter the game at
any time his coach pleases.
The second permits a substitute to talk without penalty before a play
has been run following his entry into the game. Thus a coach, if he wants
to, can send information into the fray at any time.
The last makes a fourth down pass over the goal line that is incom
