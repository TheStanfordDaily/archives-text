Do me a favor, will you?
Take all' the "JI-Amei-.can ;eams
(hat didn't honor Pete Kmetovic
with a halfliack position, wrap them
carefully in a cement slipover and
drop them in the river along with
!hat last hatch <if ring-tailed kittens.
Make sure it's a deep river, too.
I don't want any All-American teams
i without Kmeto' ic on them havin
j a single chance to float and thus
I haunt their pickers any longer,
i What I'm trying to say—and I'm a
j man who'll finally say what li<; aim:
I to even if it takes 17,000 words —i.:
that Kmetovic is the best halfback
I have seen since the start of the
1940 football season. And modest
creature that I am, I'll point out with
a calloused index finger that I saw
just about all the good ones.
I'll name you a tew that Kmeto
vic, who is the main reason Stanford
beat Nebraska in the Rose Bowl, it
superior to. There is De Correvont.
There's Franck. There's Reagan.
There's—well, that's enough to give
you a general idea.
Kmetovic didn't even make the
j official All-Coast team. He was for
gotten in the balloting for Gallar
neau, a teammate. The fact that
Gallarneau scored two touchdowns
to Kmetovic's one in the Rose Bowl
does not alter my view. Gallarneau's
first score was set up by Pete's runs.
Kmetovic is faster than a dog
chasing its own tail around a greased
pole. And he doesn't take long to
get fast, meaning that he needs no
spur to start him off. With his speed
I he has ail the things that make for
yards in the open field. He can
show a tackier a leg and take it away
with a Houdini touch. He has a
I beautiful change of pace. Just when
you think he is going at top speed,
i he slips the throttle another notch
| and really slips into high gear.
Kmetovic can take it, too. He took
a severe beating from the burly Ne
braskans, but at the finish he was
wearing a smile and tip-toeing about
I with plenty of spring left in his
muscles.
Before the Rose Bowl game the
talk was all about Standlee, Gal
, larneau, Luther, llopp and Rohrig.
' j They were the ball carriers who
' | were rated as tops and likely to
stand out. But Kmetovic was so
1 much better than any of them—so
1 much smarter, faster, tougher—that
you wondered why the Coast ex-
J ports had elected to hide his light
under a bushel of clippings— for
other backs.
He'll be back next year. So will
1 almost all of the Stanford team that
dusted Nebraska. So will Clark
| Shaughnessy. This means that all
the Rose Bowl boys have to worry
• about from now until this time next
' year is a suitable opponent for the
Indians. No matter what team comes
' out, I'll take my man Kmetovic to
be the star. He has it, and he hands
out. Ask Nebraska!
