# Wow Boy Encore in '41? Only Three Regulars Lost
## 
### CHUCK SMITH 
The sun thai ended Stanford's decisive football victory over Nebraska
New Year's Day also officially closed the Indians' first untied and unde
feated gridiron season since 1914.
In fact, the last untarnished season's record in American football at
Stanford dates way back to 1905. But in '15, a bunch of Cardinal rugby

stars rolled through 12
winning the Big Game with Califor- (
nia 2(J-8 and getting their biggest
scare, strangely enough, from a little
Santa Clara team which they beat
only 13-0.
But since then none can compare j
with Coach Clark Shaughnessy's
amazing band of Indians. Not even
Dink Templeton, Murray Cudde
back, Shipkey, or Walker, Ernie
Nevers, "Tricky Dick" Hyland, Phil
Moffatt, or Bobby Grayson played
on a team that could boast a sea
sonal record comparable to the 1940
varsity.
BOWL VICTORY TYPICAL
That greatest of all Rose Bowl
games, that 21-13 Stanford victory
over the Cornhuskers, was typical
of the entire Cardinal season. It
was a surprise to see the Indians
win their first game of the year, let
alone 10 in a row when they had
the dreary memory of '39 hanging
over them.
And in just the same way it was
startling to the 92,000 spectators in
that spacious Rose Bowl to see
Shaughnessy's Warriors do the un
expected after those first fearsome
four minutes. Just as they had been
doing all season, Albert and Co.
put together brains, speed, and their
unquenchable desire to win to come
from behind and whip the vaunted
Huskers.
Already visible is the big question
football fans the nation over will
be asking come next September:
"Will Stanford roll on?" And why
shouldn't Stanford?
CHIEF WILL BE MISSED
True, a couple of vital cogs in
Shaughnessy's smooth-running grid
machine will be missing, but the In
dians above all have been called
versatile and always have turned up
with a victory punch in one de
partment of the game.
Most sorely missed will be Cap
tain Norm Standlee, Shaughnessy's
crashing, faking, punting, passing,
and defending giant. "Chief" of
fered the necessary punch at the
middle in the tight spots and, more
important than this, he was the
threat into the line that made Hugh
Gallarneau and Pete Kmetovic click
on their end sweeps.
Norm was also the best linebacker
on the Coast, defending against flat
passes as well as line plunges with
equal success. And when his leg
was well, Norm was a punter who
could average over 50 yards per
afternoon.
II SANS GALLARNEAU
Also gone next season will be the
Cards' most improved backfield man,
another captain, Hugh Gallarneau.
Under Shaughnessy and Backfield
Coach Marehy Schwartz. Hugh. "The

♦
Duke," has changed from a hedging
runner to a powerful, still swift,
head-on ball carrier.
Instead of heading for the side
! lines as of old, this season Hugh
lowered the boom and either ran
over or right past would-be tacklers
for the most consistent ground
gaining average of any Stanford
back. In Stanford's always threat
ening aerial game, Gallarneau was
| the guy who could haul down the
! touchdown tosses.
AND BOSCO, TOO
The third graduating senior and
j the third Rose Bowl captain is Stan
"Bosco" Graff. "Bosco" finished his
third year as a first-string wingman
and was the most dependable man
on the team. Usually not spectacu
lar but consistently good, Stan
opened up in his last, the Rose Bowl
game, earning praises from Southern
California scribes of being "the
best end in Arroyo Seco since Keith
Topping."
But it is the horde of returning
first and second stringers that will
make Stanford roll on next season.
There will be Fred Meyer, Bruno
Banducci, Chuck Taylor, Vic Lind
skog, Diek Palmer, and Ed Stamm,
six of the seven first-string line
j men.
HALF BACKFIELD STAYS
Half the backfield is intact with
Stanford's Ail-American Frankie
Albert and "Sceeter Peter" Kmeto
vic still hanging around. The sec
ond string backfield with the ex
ception of Thor Peterson, who alter
nated with Sophomore Ray Ham
mett. will return. They are Milt Vu
cinich at full, and A1 Cole and Eric
Armstrong at the halfback spots.
The list of returning reserve line
men is almost endless. At ends there
will be Clem Tomerlin, Art Meiners,
Bob Ditlevsen, Hank Norberg; at
tackles, Rod Warnecke, Ed McCain,
Bill Mannon, Bud Radditz; at
guards, Ken Robcsky, Jack Fran
cis; and at center, Doug Stahle and
Colin McClintock.

be asking come next September:
"Will Stanford roll on?" And why
shouldn't Stanford?
CHIEF WILL BE MISSED
True, a couple of vital cogs in
Shaughnessy's smooth-running grid
machine will be missing, but the In
dians above all have been called
versatile and always have turned up
with a victory punch in one de
partment of the game.
Most sorely missed will be Cap
tain Norm Standlee, Shaughnessy's
crashing, faking, punting, passing,
and defending giant. "Chief" of
fered the necessary punch at the
middle in the tight spots and, more
important than this, he was the
threat into the line that made Hugh
Gallarneau and Pete Kmetovic click
on their end sweeps.
Norm was also the best linebacker
on the Coast, defending against flat
passes as well as line plunges with
equal success. And when his leg
was well, Norm was a punter who
could average over 50 yards per
afternoon.
II SANS GALLARNEAU
Also gone next season will be the
Cards' most improved backfield man,
another captain, Hugh Gallarneau.
Under Shaughnessy and Backfield
Coach Marehy Schwartz. Hugh. "The

♦
Duke," has changed from a hedging
runner to a powerful, still swift,
head-on ball carrier.
Instead of heading for the side
! lines as of old, this season Hugh
lowered the boom and either ran
over or right past would-be tacklers
for the most consistent ground
gaining average of any Stanford
back. In Stanford's always threat
ening aerial game, Gallarneau was
| the guy who could haul down the
! touchdown tosses.
AND BOSCO, TOO
The third graduating senior and
j the third Rose Bowl captain is Stan
"Bosco" Graff. "Bosco" finished his
third year as a first-string wingman
and was the most dependable man
on the team. Usually not spectacu
lar but consistently good, Stan
opened up in his last, the Rose Bowl
game, earning praises from Southern
California scribes of being "the
best end in Arroyo Seco since Keith
Topping."
But it is the horde of returning
first and second stringers that will
make Stanford roll on next season.
There will be Fred Meyer, Bruno
Banducci, Chuck Taylor, Vic Lind
skog, Diek Palmer, and Ed Stamm,
six of the seven first-string line
j men.
HALF BACKFIELD STAYS
Half the backfield is intact with
Stanford's Ail-American Frankie
Albert and "Sceeter Peter" Kmeto
vic still hanging around. The sec
ond string backfield with the ex
ception of Thor Peterson, who alter
nated with Sophomore Ray Ham
mett. will return. They are Milt Vu
cinich at full, and A1 Cole and Eric
Armstrong at the halfback spots.
The list of returning reserve line
men is almost endless. At ends there
will be Clem Tomerlin, Art Meiners,
Bob Ditlevsen, Hank Norberg; at
tackles, Rod Warnecke, Ed McCain,
Bill Mannon, Bud Radditz; at
guards, Ken Robcsky, Jack Fran
cis; and at center, Doug Stahle and
Colin McClintock.
The sun thai ended Stanford's decisive football victory over Nebraska
New Year's Day also officially closed the Indians' first untied and unde
feated gridiron season since 1914.
In fact, the last untarnished season's record in American football at
Stanford dates way back to 1905. But in '15, a bunch of Cardinal rugby

stars rolled through 12
winning the Big Game with Califor- (
nia 2(J-8 and getting their biggest
scare, strangely enough, from a little
Santa Clara team which they beat
only 13-0.
But since then none can compare j
with Coach Clark Shaughnessy's
amazing band of Indians. Not even
Dink Templeton, Murray Cudde
back, Shipkey, or Walker, Ernie
Nevers, "Tricky Dick" Hyland, Phil
Moffatt, or Bobby Grayson played
on a team that could boast a sea
sonal record comparable to the 1940
varsity.
BOWL VICTORY TYPICAL
That greatest of all Rose Bowl
games, that 21-13 Stanford victory
over the Cornhuskers, was typical
of the entire Cardinal season. It
was a surprise to see the Indians
win their first game of the year, let
alone 10 in a row when they had
the dreary memory of '39 hanging
over them.
And in just the same way it was
startling to the 92,000 spectators in
that spacious Rose Bowl to see
Shaughnessy's Warriors do the un
expected after those first fearsome
four minutes. Just as they had been
doing all season, Albert and Co.
put together brains, speed, and their
unquenchable desire to win to come
from behind and whip the vaunted
Huskers.

third year as a first-string wingman
and was the most dependable man
on the team. Usually not spectacu
lar but consistently good, Stan
opened up in his last, the Rose Bowl
game, earning praises from Southern
California scribes of being "the
best end in Arroyo Seco since Keith
Topping."
But it is the horde of returning
first and second stringers that will
make Stanford roll on next season.
There will be Fred Meyer, Bruno
Banducci, Chuck Taylor, Vic Lind
skog, Diek Palmer, and Ed Stamm,
six of the seven first-string line
j men.
HALF BACKFIELD STAYS
Half the backfield is intact with
Stanford's Ail-American Frankie
Albert and "Sceeter Peter" Kmeto
vic still hanging around. The sec
ond string backfield with the ex
ception of Thor Peterson, who alter
nated with Sophomore Ray Ham
mett. will return. They are Milt Vu
cinich at full, and A1 Cole and Eric
Armstrong at the halfback spots.
The list of returning reserve line
men is almost endless. At ends there
will be Clem Tomerlin, Art Meiners,
Bob Ditlevsen, Hank Norberg; at
tackles, Rod Warnecke, Ed McCain,
Bill Mannon, Bud Radditz; at
guards, Ken Robcsky, Jack Fran
cis; and at center, Doug Stahle and
Colin McClintock.
The sun thai ended Stanford's decisive football victory over Nebraska
New Year's Day also officially closed the Indians' first untied and unde
feated gridiron season since 1914.
In fact, the last untarnished season's record in American football at
Stanford dates way back to 1905. But in '15, a bunch of Cardinal rugby

stars rolled through 12
winning the Big Game with Califor- (
nia 2(J-8 and getting their biggest
scare, strangely enough, from a little
Santa Clara team which they beat
only 13-0.
But since then none can compare j
with Coach Clark Shaughnessy's
amazing band of Indians. Not even
Dink Templeton, Murray Cudde
back, Shipkey, or Walker, Ernie
Nevers, "Tricky Dick" Hyland, Phil
Moffatt, or Bobby Grayson played
on a team that could boast a sea
sonal record comparable to the 1940
varsity.
BOWL VICTORY TYPICAL
That greatest of all Rose Bowl
games, that 21-13 Stanford victory
over the Cornhuskers, was typical
of the entire Cardinal season. It
was a surprise to see the Indians
win their first game of the year, let
alone 10 in a row when they had
the dreary memory of '39 hanging
over them.
And in just the same way it was
startling to the 92,000 spectators in
that spacious Rose Bowl to see
Shaughnessy's Warriors do the un
expected after those first fearsome
four minutes. Just as they had been
doing all season, Albert and Co.
put together brains, speed, and their
unquenchable desire to win to come
from behind and whip the vaunted
Huskers.
Already visible is the big question
football fans the nation over will
be asking come next September:
"Will Stanford roll on?" And why
shouldn't Stanford?
CHIEF WILL BE MISSED
True, a couple of vital cogs in
Shaughnessy's smooth-running grid
machine will be missing, but the In
dians above all have been called
versatile and always have turned up
with a victory punch in one de
partment of the game.
Most sorely missed will be Cap
tain Norm Standlee, Shaughnessy's
crashing, faking, punting, passing,
and defending giant. "Chief" of
fered the necessary punch at the
middle in the tight spots and, more
important than this, he was the
threat into the line that made Hugh
Gallarneau and Pete Kmetovic click
on their end sweeps.
Norm was also the best linebacker
on the Coast, defending against flat
passes as well as line plunges with
equal success. And when his leg
was well, Norm was a punter who
could average over 50 yards per
afternoon.
II SANS GALLARNEAU
Also gone next season will be the
Cards' most improved backfield man,
another captain, Hugh Gallarneau.
Under Shaughnessy and Backfield
Coach Marehy Schwartz. Hugh. "The

♦
Duke," has changed from a hedging
runner to a powerful, still swift,
head-on ball carrier.
Instead of heading for the side
! lines as of old, this season Hugh
lowered the boom and either ran
over or right past would-be tacklers
for the most consistent ground
gaining average of any Stanford
back. In Stanford's always threat
ening aerial game, Gallarneau was
| the guy who could haul down the
! touchdown tosses.
AND BOSCO, TOO

j the third Rose Bowl captain is Stan
"Bosco" Graff. "Bosco" finished his
