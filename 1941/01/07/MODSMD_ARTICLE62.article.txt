## 
### 
Wednesday, weather permitting. Stanford's championship rugby team
will start practice for a busy season.
Harry Maloney, head of the coaching stalT. was very optimistic over
Ihe chances of the team, and predicted one of the best seasons e\er.
One of the main reasons for Coach Maloney's optimism is that under a

new ruling, anyone enrolled at
University, except freshmen, is eli
gible to play. This includes gradu- j
ate and transfer students.
Freshmen will not be left out of
the picture this year. Maloney an
nounced that if enough freshmen j
turn out, a first-year team will lie
organized and will enter into com
petition.
Another more obvious reason for !
the optimism in rugby circles is the j
large number of players the staff ;
has to draw on. Among these are
Bernard, Jedenoff, Geisler, and j
Pugh. And from Stanford's unbeaten
'ootball team will come two expe
rienced ruggers in Frankie Albeit, |
who is slated for his old position at j
fullback, and speedy Pete Kmetovic,
who will probably take one of the
mside three-quarter positions.

Though Kmetovic will not have
his partner of last year, Gallarncuu,
on his other side, indications are j
that a great many more footballers j
will turn out for rugby.
