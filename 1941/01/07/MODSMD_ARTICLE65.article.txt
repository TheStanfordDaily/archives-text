ON the front page of today's Daily, A1 Mas
ters offers a general accounting of Rose
Bowl ticket sales. As the man who had to "take
the rap" for all the confusion and tumult that
resulted from ticket distribution, Mr. Masters
deserves a little sympathy.
During the past lew years the system of ap
portioning those $4.40 gilt-edged securities has
assumed more the aspect of a racket than an
organized method of allotment. From a con
sideration of the terms of the contract between
the Tournament of Roses and the Coast Con
ference, it is easy to discover that the fault does
not lie entirely with the host school. It would
be foolish to lay all blame upon Stanford in
this case.
The ill-will which resulted from the sale
more than outweighed the $100,000 that is piled
in B.A.C. coffers. And A1 Masters, like every
Stanford student, realizes that.
It has been rather obvious for the last five
years that a thorough reorganization of Rose
Bowl ticket sales should be effected. The Rose
Bowl is more than a Pasadena civic enterprise;
it is now an integral part of the Coast Confer
ence season. And the Conference should exert
pressure upon the Rose Bowl Association to
revamp the entire structure of distribution.
When an attempt is made to toss 88,000 tick
ets to 200,000 would-be buyers, someone is cer
tain to be deprived. This time again, as in the
past, alumni and students suffered. Even
though every Stanford man or woman who
wished to attend the game was provided with
a ticket, it is regrettable that the B.A.C. failed to
fill student orders for general admission seats.
In this respect the B.A.C. violated student faith
for it intimated that all such "optional" requests
would be filled. In reality only a fraction of
the earliest orders received were recognized.
The remainder of the block of 33,000 seats went
to alumni and "special groups."
These special groups included travel agen
cies, railroad lines, hotels, and individuals who,
since the Rose Bowl first became popular, have
been allowed to buy large quantities of seats.
This practice should cease. When it is possible
for a Los Angeles furniture store to give two free
Bowl tickets with every purchase of a four
piece bedroom set while Stanford men and
women cannot obtain seats, the time has come
for an extensive reorganization.
Any attempt to remedy the situation will con
stitute an advancement, but the most glaring
mistakes might be removed by these steps:
Eliminating all block selling to "special
groups."
Reducing public sale to about 10,000 seats and
cutting the maximum purchase to two, instead
of four, tickets.
Apportioning more seats to visiting schools
and less to the Tournament of Roses and Coast
Conference members.
Reducing student "optionals" to two instead
of four, but honoring students and faculty be
fore alumni.

Reducing alumni applications to two tickets.
These and other reforms might not satisfy
that tremendous audience of 112,000 who
wanted to watch the Indians and the 'Huskers
but were stopped short at their post-office box
by a card from the Rose Bowl that said "we
regret to inform you."
But. with the prospect of making a return
hip to Pasadena next winter, Stanford should
do its utmost to accomplish some new means
of distributing those pasteboards.

since the Rose Bowl first became popular, have
been allowed to buy large quantities of seats.
This practice should cease. When it is possible
for a Los Angeles furniture store to give two free
Bowl tickets with every purchase of a four
piece bedroom set while Stanford men and
women cannot obtain seats, the time has come
for an extensive reorganization.
Any attempt to remedy the situation will con
stitute an advancement, but the most glaring
mistakes might be removed by these steps:
Eliminating all block selling to "special
groups."
Reducing public sale to about 10,000 seats and
cutting the maximum purchase to two, instead
of four, tickets.
Apportioning more seats to visiting schools
and less to the Tournament of Roses and Coast
Conference members.
Reducing student "optionals" to two instead
of four, but honoring students and faculty be
fore alumni.

Reducing alumni applications to two tickets.
These and other reforms might not satisfy
that tremendous audience of 112,000 who
wanted to watch the Indians and the 'Huskers
but were stopped short at their post-office box
by a card from the Rose Bowl that said "we
regret to inform you."
But. with the prospect of making a return
hip to Pasadena next winter, Stanford should
do its utmost to accomplish some new means
of distributing those pasteboards.
ON the front page of today's Daily, A1 Mas
ters offers a general accounting of Rose
Bowl ticket sales. As the man who had to "take
the rap" for all the confusion and tumult that
resulted from ticket distribution, Mr. Masters
deserves a little sympathy.
During the past lew years the system of ap
portioning those $4.40 gilt-edged securities has
assumed more the aspect of a racket than an
organized method of allotment. From a con
sideration of the terms of the contract between
the Tournament of Roses and the Coast Con
ference, it is easy to discover that the fault does
not lie entirely with the host school. It would
be foolish to lay all blame upon Stanford in
this case.
The ill-will which resulted from the sale
more than outweighed the $100,000 that is piled
in B.A.C. coffers. And A1 Masters, like every
Stanford student, realizes that.
It has been rather obvious for the last five
years that a thorough reorganization of Rose
Bowl ticket sales should be effected. The Rose
Bowl is more than a Pasadena civic enterprise;
it is now an integral part of the Coast Confer
ence season. And the Conference should exert
pressure upon the Rose Bowl Association to
revamp the entire structure of distribution.
When an attempt is made to toss 88,000 tick
ets to 200,000 would-be buyers, someone is cer
tain to be deprived. This time again, as in the
past, alumni and students suffered. Even
though every Stanford man or woman who
wished to attend the game was provided with
a ticket, it is regrettable that the B.A.C. failed to
fill student orders for general admission seats.
In this respect the B.A.C. violated student faith
for it intimated that all such "optional" requests
would be filled. In reality only a fraction of
the earliest orders received were recognized.
The remainder of the block of 33,000 seats went
to alumni and "special groups."
These special groups included travel agen
cies, railroad lines, hotels, and individuals who,
since the Rose Bowl first became popular, have
been allowed to buy large quantities of seats.
