# And No Gray Hairs

THE first fifty years met the second ... on
New Year's Day, January 1, 1941.
Fifty years ago a Governor of this state and
his wife built a memorial for a cherished son
who had left this world too soon. The only
child of Senator and Mrs. Stanford had died,
but with the building of the University which
bears his name the children of California be
came their children.

Senator and Mrs. Stanford have become al
most legendary figures, immersed as they are
in the haze of stories of the past. But for fifty
years their life-blood has been reflected and
perfected in the light of this institution.
To you and me of this undergraduate genera
tion, the thought and sacrifice which back
grounded each progressive step of this Uni
versity—in buildings and eguipment, in pres
tige, in tradition, and in worth—can hardly be
recognized. It is difficult for us to examine the
Farm in anything but the light of our own
studenthood.
A handful of students, a few buildings, have
grown through a half century, over obstacles
which sometimes threatened to overwhelm
them, into the Stanford University of 1941.
Today the ivy-covered buildings of the Quad,

the broad acres of the campus, seem permanent
gifts of time. But a rough road was traveled
through the fifty years between 1891 and today.
Permanent they seem, and yet, standing in
the crossroads of a century, we can look for
ward to the rough road that lies ahead. Yet you
and I can be confident that the road will be
followed, and that the proud structure of today
will be even greater in the years to come.
"The winds of freedom" have blown for fifty
years. The "children of California" will be Stan
ford's for many years to come.—W. C.
