# Position and Team Play
## 
### 
UNDISCOURAGED by rain, post-New Year
fatigue, and the resumption of classes,
Daily staff will ford the stream that flows in
front of the Shack and cluster for muster at
1:15 today. Edit Board, provided with speed
boats, will tie up at the dock about 1 o'clock.
After the holiday yarns have been spun, staff
will adjourn to the Cellar for bromos.
