after-vacation rubbage

JTI YA, FELLOW. Have a good vacation?
Not bad. How about you?
Not bad. Have a nice Christmas? Was Santa Claus
good to you? Heh, heh, heh.
Pretty good. How about you?
Oh, forget it. All we wanted to say was Happy
New Year and welcome back to the Farm for another
quarter of that educational mumbo-jumbo. Oh, boy,
only 10 weeks until finals!

Your Hit Parade had "Jeannie with the Light
Brown Hair" right up there—last week. It was a close
fight over "Camptown Piace Track" and everybody's
favorite, "Sierra Sue."
Yes, this ASCAP-BMI music fight seems to be the
big topic of conversation buzzing around these days.
Just about everybody agrees with the end that BMI
is seeking—but not with the means used to obtain that
end. One gets awfully tired of the same four songs
over and over, doesn't one?
But don't count ASCAP out. They are fighting
harder than Stanford football players in the second
quarter. Over the vacation past, they mailed a propa
gandish letter which cries out against the foul, das
tardly things that are being done to college songs. Oh,
if you only knew!
In that letter, ASCAP blames everything on BMI
and the Germans and Italians. ASCAP says that all
three are in cahoots. But, here, read for yourself a
paragraph from the ASCAP letter:
"And what do they (BMI) propose to substitute for
ASCAP music? Songs over 56 years old that are
consequently in the pubic domain. The works of un
established, mostly inexperienced newcomers who are
being plugged by Broadcast Music, Inc., radio's own
subsidized publishing company. German and Italian
music acquired through a deal approved by the Nazi
and Fascist Ministers of Propaganda. This latter is
their largest source of material."
Oh, those nasty Germans and Italians. Don't you
dare listen to a BMI song. Germans, you know.

class in Personal Problems in Modern Society
has struck a bottleneck.
Professor Berreman wanted to get a new textbook
so he sent East for a few copies. The publishing com
pany wrote back that the government won't allow
them to ship that book through the mails. Hot stuff.
And there are no copies in the library.
So the class will just have to go on using the same
old text. Incidentally, that class is at 11 o'clock, Mon
day through Friday.

A T the Rose Bowl: A fat, elderly woman who ob
viously had never seen a football game before sud
denly turned to her escort and said, "Why doesn't
Stanford put back in the dirty players? They do much
better."
Some Stanford band members got plenty of drinks
in Los Angeles—and all for nothiVig.
They just walked up to a Nebraska man and, clap
ping him on the back, said, "Well, we did it."
"Did what?"
"Hitch-hiked all the way out here from Oklahoma.
We're broke, but we've got our Bowl tickets."
"Shay, boys, that's some feat. Come on and have a
drink."
And they went on and on and on and on.

JTI YA, FELLOW. Have a good vacation?
Not bad. How about you?
Not bad. Have a nice Christmas? Was Santa Claus
good to you? Heh, heh, heh.
Pretty good. How about you?
Oh, forget it. All we wanted to say was Happy
New Year and welcome back to the Farm for another
quarter of that educational mumbo-jumbo. Oh, boy,
only 10 weeks until finals!

Your Hit Parade had "Jeannie with the Light
Brown Hair" right up there—last week. It was a close
fight over "Camptown Piace Track" and everybody's
favorite, "Sierra Sue."
Yes, this ASCAP-BMI music fight seems to be the
big topic of conversation buzzing around these days.
Just about everybody agrees with the end that BMI
is seeking—but not with the means used to obtain that
end. One gets awfully tired of the same four songs
over and over, doesn't one?
But don't count ASCAP out. They are fighting
harder than Stanford football players in the second
quarter. Over the vacation past, they mailed a propa
gandish letter which cries out against the foul, das
tardly things that are being done to college songs. Oh,
if you only knew!
In that letter, ASCAP blames everything on BMI
and the Germans and Italians. ASCAP says that all
three are in cahoots. But, here, read for yourself a
paragraph from the ASCAP letter:
"And what do they (BMI) propose to substitute for
ASCAP music? Songs over 56 years old that are
consequently in the pubic domain. The works of un
established, mostly inexperienced newcomers who are
being plugged by Broadcast Music, Inc., radio's own
subsidized publishing company. German and Italian
music acquired through a deal approved by the Nazi
and Fascist Ministers of Propaganda. This latter is
their largest source of material."
Oh, those nasty Germans and Italians. Don't you
dare listen to a BMI song. Germans, you know.

class in Personal Problems in Modern Society
has struck a bottleneck.
Professor Berreman wanted to get a new textbook
so he sent East for a few copies. The publishing com
pany wrote back that the government won't allow
them to ship that book through the mails. Hot stuff.
And there are no copies in the library.
So the class will just have to go on using the same
old text. Incidentally, that class is at 11 o'clock, Mon
day through Friday.

A T the Rose Bowl: A fat, elderly woman who ob
viously had never seen a football game before sud
denly turned to her escort and said, "Why doesn't
Stanford put back in the dirty players? They do much
better."
Some Stanford band members got plenty of drinks
in Los Angeles—and all for nothiVig.
They just walked up to a Nebraska man and, clap
ping him on the back, said, "Well, we did it."
"Did what?"
"Hitch-hiked all the way out here from Oklahoma.
We're broke, but we've got our Bowl tickets."
"Shay, boys, that's some feat. Come on and have a
drink."
And they went on and on and on and on.
