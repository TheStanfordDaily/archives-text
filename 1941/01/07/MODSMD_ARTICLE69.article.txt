DAILY SHAKEDOWN

rpHE EDITOR, SIR:
May I suggest a re-examination of the Daily's
policy in regard to reviews of campus dramatic and
musical performances. The general spirit of co-opera
tion is splendid and greatly appreciated. I refer only
to the practice of printing "criticisms" by unqualified
reviewers.
Realizing that the highest level of critical journal
ism can not be maintained in a student publication,
it is, nevertheless, astonishing that the Daily's reviews
of campus productions are usually inept and often ill
considered.
There is no thought of entrusting the excellent
news commentary, History 1941, or the traditionally
fine major sport reviews to any but the best qualified
writers. Is this not possible in the field of art criti
cism?
To adequately "cover" a dramatic performance or a
concert requires a good deal of "background" which
means not only reading but a rich experience in at
tending all sorts of productions and a certain amount
of first-hand knowledge of the concert stage and the
theaterâ€”its traditions, its techniques, and its signifi
cance in the social pattern. It is conceivable that this
background is possessed by a considerable number of
Stanford men and women. I make no imputation as to
sincerity of effort but I have noticed in two years of
following the Stanford Daily that most of your re
viewers bring little of the necessary background to
their assignment.
This is no plea for "rave notices" or undeserved
compliments. Every performance inevitably must,
stand upon its own merit. A review may be "good"
regardless of opinion. Too many student critics, in
fact, are guilty of "gush." The most an educated per
son asks of a reviewer is a minimum of bias, an appre
ciation of outstanding technical problems, general jour
nalistic ability including an effective vocabulary, and
the important ability to relate the theater to life.
If there is any basis for the foregoing comments, it
provides a real challenge for Stanford journalism. I
feel certain you will agree that the general attitude
toward the arts at Stanford is. to say the least, unsatis
factory. A valiant effort is being made to raise the
standards and extend the influence of drama, music
and dance. The Daily can be of great assistance in
maintaining the highest possible standards of campus
reviews.
