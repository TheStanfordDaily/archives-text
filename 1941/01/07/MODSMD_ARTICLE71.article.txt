# Another "Epic" Finds Taylor As Doughboy
## 
### 
FLIGHT COMMAND," starring
Robert Taylor, now playing at the
Stanford Theater
One day, way in the deep, dim
past of American motion pictures,
some enterprising scenario writer
got an idea for a story about Uncle
Sam's fighting forces. Just imagine
the thrill of seeing a poor young
recruit being picked on by all those
tough soldiers, and being so, so un
happy. And then he ups and rescues
one of those who had picked on him,
becomes a hero of the outfit, and
is loved by all, including that pretty
young thing who used to be the
girl of the guy he rescued.
With a few minor changes, this
gush has been used by Hollywood in
and out for about ten years—every
time they think they need another
patriotic picture they pull it out of
the archives and away they go.
BOY LOSES GIRL
"Flight Command" is the latest of
this series, and is as trite and boring
as any of them—the only difference
being that Pat O'Brien isn't in it and
the guy (Robert Taylor) doesn't get
the girl (she's married already).
Taylor is as good-looking as ever,
while Ruth Hussey adds the sex
appeal. The show isn't really so bad
if you disregard the plot and watch
the planes zooming around up above
or Miss Hussey slinking around
down below.
PLENTY OF BEAUTY
The companion feature—"A Night
at Earl Carroll's"—bears out Oscar
Levant's premise that no matter how
zany and inconsistent the show is
as long as there are plenty of good
looking women and a few corny
jokes the audience will enjoy it (we
did). Brenda and Cobina and Ken
Murray add the comic touch, while
Carroll's cuties ("through these por
tals pass, etc.") are nice decoration.

as any of them—the only difference
being that Pat O'Brien isn't in it and
the guy (Robert Taylor) doesn't get
the girl (she's married already).
Taylor is as good-looking as ever,
while Ruth Hussey adds the sex
appeal. The show isn't really so bad
if you disregard the plot and watch
the planes zooming around up above
or Miss Hussey slinking around
down below.
PLENTY OF BEAUTY
The companion feature—"A Night
at Earl Carroll's"—bears out Oscar
Levant's premise that no matter how
zany and inconsistent the show is
as long as there are plenty of good
looking women and a few corny
jokes the audience will enjoy it (we
did). Brenda and Cobina and Ken
Murray add the comic touch, while
Carroll's cuties ("through these por
tals pass, etc.") are nice decoration.
