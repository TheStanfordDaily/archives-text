# Wilbur Publishes Book of Speeches
## 
### 
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur's book,
"Human Hopes," was released by
the Stanford University Press just
before Christmas. This is the third
book of a series that is made up of
Dr. Wilbur's speeches to medical,
school, and political groups. The
new book has even wider appeal
than the two previous volumes due
to the greater selection of speeches.
It is written in the same forceful
style that always characterizes Dr.
Wilbur's writings and speeches.
The book, certain to attain the
success of the two earlier works, can
be obtained through the University
Press. The price is $3.
