# Masters Clarifies Rose Bowl Ticket Sale Mix-up
## 
### DON LIEBENDORFER 
Athletic Publicity Director
Attempting to fill a demand for more than 200,000 tickets with just
88,447 seats available—that was the impossible task which faced A1 Mas
ters, general manager of the Board of Athletic Control, in handling the
Rose Bowl game between Stanford and Nebraska. Masters, who believes
that between 200,000 and 250,000 tickets could have been sold, had they
available, said yesterday,

"There have been so many rumors
and misunderstandings in regard to
the ticket distribution that we should
like to have all interested parties
know the complete facts.
"In the first place, the Rose Bowl
game is different from any other
football contest in that the New
Year's Day classic involves more
than the two competing schools, in
this case, Stanford and Nebraska.
Other groups concerned are the
Tournament of Roses, the Press, the
Pacific Coast Conference, and the
General Public. Incidentally, the
distribution of tickets is more or
less covered by a contract, which is
in its third, and I sincerely hope,
its last year.
RESTRICTIVE CONTRACT
"This contract is between the Pa
cific Coast Conference and the Tour
nament of Roses and is based on
the theory that each party involved
is entitled to an opportunity to
cover its obligations to as great an
eft ent as possible. Not a single one
of the groups concerned was at all
satisfied with the number of tick
ets it received.
"The answer is, of course, that
the demand far exceeds the supply
and the Rose Bowl has outgrown
its accommodations, at least in a
game which captures the public
fancy as did the Stanford-Nebraska
affair. We made every attempt to
give Stanford students a good break.
3-day rooter sale
"The rooters sale was spread over
three days and each student, in addi
tion to his rooter's ticket, was Riven
an application blank for four addi
tional seats. These student, applica
tions were in Class 2, with alumni.
Inasmuch as the rooters sale was
held on December 2, 3, and 4 and
alumni applications were not mailed
until December 2, the students who
appeared on the first day of the sale
actually had an advantage over
alumni.
"The Stanford - Nebraska game
j was sold out in two and one-half
days, however, and students or
alumni who did not return their ap
| plications immediately could not be
accommodated. We were able to
J take care of only part of these
j blanks which arrived in our office
; December 5, and all which arrived
later had to be turned back.
"Here is the exact accounting as
to how the tickets were distributed
: to the various groups:
i 14.105 Tournament of Roses
i I 10.1(»6 University of Nebraska
13.00 ft Public sale
Stanford rooters
4,277 Press (outside of press box)
