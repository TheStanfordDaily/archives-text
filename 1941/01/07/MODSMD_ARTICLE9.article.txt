# Farm Party In Rose-Bowl Wows Crowd
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Ninety-thousand people came to
Stanford's 50th birthday party last
Wednesday.

A number of ill-wishers from Ne
braska crashed the brawl, but those
concerned agreed that the hosts had
chosen a beautiful setting (the Rose
Bowl) for the celebration, and that
the presence of the Cornhuskers
(both team and rooters) added a
necessary tang to the occasion.

Los Angeles watched amazed as
the Farm, transplanted en masse for
the occasion, blasted the roof off the
Ambassador at Monday's rally, cele
brated New Year's Eve in the usual
murderous fashion, and then con
verged, little the worse, on Pasa
dena New Year's Day. Consensus
among the Stanfords seems to be
that the pace was grueling but
worth while.

Packing the humid Ambassador
Auditorium, the early arrivals (late
comers were forced to seek enter
tainment elsewhere) expressed ut
most confidence in the Wow-boys,
who were safely tucked in in Pasa
dena at the time. Harry Muheim
turned in a wrily humorous job of
emceeing the proceedings—introduc
ing the beauteous Nebraska queen,
Coach Shaughnessy, and Everett
Smith, president of the Los Angeles
Alumni, in fitting style.
Aside from the first moment of
confusion, when the Stanford root
ing section inadvertently rose to
cheer the red-clad 'Huskers, the sec
tion conducted itself in a manner to
make both Rally Committee and
Gordy Nicoll proud.
Among the post-game crowd com
ments of the "I wasn't worried a bit,
not a bit, when they made the first
touchdown" sort were usual. How
ever, those across the field who
heard the first Axe-Yell will swear
that there was mass-prayer in the
hallowed lines.
Perhaps the major problem among
the rooters was the fact that no
cokes were sold on the bleachers.
The strangest contretemps resulting
from this oversight was the case of
the man whose neighbor went out
for cokes during the half. He got
along all right holding two cards
until the map stunt came along. He
himself was background in that
stunt, but his partner was a section
of Nebraska—and as such had to
stand up. Rally Committee Chair
man Pat Smith refuses to tell how
a quick-witted sophomore commit
teeman solved the baffled rooter's
problem.
While most of Stanford arrived in
tact and only a little weary at game
lime, the Farm crowd who turned
up at 9:15 o'clock for the Tourna
ment of Roses parade was regarded
with awe by their more slothful
fellows. The Stanford float, a gi
gantic birthday cake honoring the
50th year, received third prize in
the educational units.

Ninety-thousand people came to
Stanford's 50th birthday party last
Wednesday.

A number of ill-wishers from Ne
braska crashed the brawl, but those
concerned agreed that the hosts had
chosen a beautiful setting (the Rose
Bowl) for the celebration, and that
the presence of the Cornhuskers
(both team and rooters) added a
necessary tang to the occasion.

Los Angeles watched amazed as
the Farm, transplanted en masse for
the occasion, blasted the roof off the
Ambassador at Monday's rally, cele
brated New Year's Eve in the usual
murderous fashion, and then con
verged, little the worse, on Pasa
dena New Year's Day. Consensus
among the Stanfords seems to be
that the pace was grueling but
worth while.

Packing the humid Ambassador
Auditorium, the early arrivals (late
comers were forced to seek enter
tainment elsewhere) expressed ut
most confidence in the Wow-boys,
who were safely tucked in in Pasa
dena at the time. Harry Muheim
turned in a wrily humorous job of
emceeing the proceedings—introduc
ing the beauteous Nebraska queen,
Coach Shaughnessy, and Everett
Smith, president of the Los Angeles
Alumni, in fitting style.

confusion, when the Stanford root
ing section inadvertently rose to
cheer the red-clad 'Huskers, the sec
tion conducted itself in a manner to
make both Rally Committee and
Gordy Nicoll proud.
