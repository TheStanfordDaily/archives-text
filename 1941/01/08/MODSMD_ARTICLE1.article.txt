r PHE gravity of the present inter
national situation has not been
recognized by a large section of the
American people. Obviously, Presi
dent Roosevelt has been aware of
this for some time, and his message
to Congress two days ago reflected
consternation over the apathy of
Americans who are still unwilling to
think about the war in Europe or
America's place in a world at war.

And yet even more perplexing is
the attitude of those who do not
realize that national responsibility
must be placed immediately over
any "self-responsibility," for in this
category one may list numerous em
ployer and employee leaders whose
co-operation the nation needs now
more than ever before.
At the present time, a miniature
war is brewing in one of the major
industrial plants of the nation—in
the Ford plant at Dearborn, Mich
igan. Without attempting to con
demn entirely cither side in the
light, one thing is certain. Neither
side has placed national interest
above personal interest. In other
words, neither realizes fully the
gravity of the present crisis.
Various attacks have been made
upon Ford ever since many years
ago he attempted to be an expert on
aflairs of the nation and of the
world by speaking and writing for
public consumption.
More recently he has been at
tacked as pro-German and anti-
British.
The CIO, likewise, has come in
for its share of criticism. Also the
accusation of Communist influence
and of selfish motives has been di
rected at the union.
But it is possible that one or
both parties in the labor fight in
the Ford plant may be brought ab
ruptly to the realization that the
safety of the nation depends to a
certain degree on co-operation from
them. ,
Indeed, it will shock America if
the government is forced to tell the
union it must cease its organizing
activities within the plant for the
duration of the emergency or if
Ford is told he must play ball with
the Administration or give up his
right to run his own plant.
The possibility that either of these
or both will be forced upon the Ad
ministration is not as remote as many
now believe. It is clear that the
President has proclaimed what
amounts to a state of war for the
internal economy of the nation.

German troops are reported

Should Germany occupy the sim

Boris, it would he just one short
step to Salonika, the Greek port
on the Aegean.
Unlike the terrain in which Ital
ians and Greeks have been fighting
in western Greece and in Albania,
the land in the eastern section is
relatively flat and unobstructed.
German mechanized divisions could
strike quickly in this country and
confront the Greek armies on a new
front.
British help to Greece should Ger
many strike with her mechanized
troops would probably be of little
significance, for Britain is not pre
pared to resist an attack of this na
ture with the small land force
which has been supporting Greece.
Occupation of Salonika by the
Germans would be disastrous to
Greece and would force Britain to
withdraw from its only foothold in

Salonika is less than a hundred
