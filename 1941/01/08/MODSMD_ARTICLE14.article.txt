### 
Thinking about a job for the sum
mer? Then don't think about it any
longer but put in an application
at the student employment bureau
in the administration building as
soon as possible.
Hashing jobs, camp counselors,
roustabouts, cannery workersâ€”any
of these and many more are being
offered, and early applications are
advisable to insure early interviews
with prospective employers.
