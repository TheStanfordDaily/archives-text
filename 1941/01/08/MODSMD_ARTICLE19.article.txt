# Diplomat Comments on League Action in Russo-Finnish War
## Holsti Returns to Stanford Faculty After 10 Years as Geneva Minister 
### JEAN NOWELL 
The little white card on the door indicates that the office belongs to an
R. Holsti, and that, if you want to see him, his office hours are from 3 to
4 o'clock on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
But the name on that card would mean a great deal to any informed
diplomat—for it was the name R. Holsti who, a year ago, stood in the

Palace of Peace in Geneva and
livered Finland's great appeal to the
League of Nations.
"When the Finnish government,"
he said on that occasion, "asked you
to meet it believed that you might

find some way of transforming
world-wide sympathy for Finland in
to a practical idea. Give us back
peace!"
Dr. Holsti's efforts on behalf of
Finland in part resulted in Russia's
expulsion from the League and the
organization of an unprecedented
scale by the League secretariat of
immediate and practical aid to Fin
land.
LEAGUE'S FUTURE
On the Farm as acting professor
of political' sicence for winter, spring,
and summer quarters, Dr. Rudolf
Holsti, in an interview yesterday,
said that the League circle in Geneva
is "optimistic as regards the future"
of the League.
"We mustn't forget that the League
has great property, that is, the two
palaces and 80 to 100 million Swiss
francs," he declared. "Roughly, that
is 20 to 25 million dollars, and there
are more than 50 states in the League
whose property it is."
STILL DIPLOMAT
When asked whether, in the event
of a British victory, the League
would play an important part in
framing of the peace treaty, Dr. Hol
sti shrugged and commented, "That's
for the members to decide."
He refused, smiling, to make any
sort of statements at all on Fin
land's ticklish diplomatic and polit
ical relations with its totalitarian
neighbors because "I am still a mem
ber of the diplomatic service of my
country"; and would only state that,
as far as he could determine, the
newspaper accounts of the Russo-
Finnish war were accurate and un
biased.
DISTINGUISHED CAREER
From 1914 to 1918 Dr. Holsti was
acting professor of political science
at the University of Helsinki, and
was a member of the Finnish par
liament from 1913 to 1918. He en
tered the Finnish government in
1917, and then was appointed diplo
matic representative to the Peace
Conference in 1919.
He served as foregn minister
through four different cabinets from
1919 to 1922, and then took over the
post of temporary representative to
the League. He held the temporary
post until 1927, at which time he
was made permanent minister to the
League. He handled Finnish affairs
in Geneva until 1940, simultaneously
filling the position of foreign min
ister again in 1936 and 1938.
THANKS HOOVER
"We are extremely grateful, the
Finns, to Mr. Herbert Hoover and
his committee for what they have
done for us," he said. "I met Mr.
Hoover in London in '18, and he
then gave us incalculable aid in the
way of foodstuffs and supplies. So,
he knew already how to help us
when the time came again.
"I cannot say that Stanford is bet
ter today than it was in the summer
of 1930 when I taught here last," he
laughed, "because that would imply
that, it was not so good then. I think
it is one of the greatest universities
in the world."

Dr. Holsti will speak at Lunch
eon Club on "The Role of the
Small Nation" at 12:15 o'clock to
day.

is 20 to 25 million dollars, and there
are more than 50 states in the League
whose property it is."
STILL DIPLOMAT
When asked whether, in the event
of a British victory, the League
would play an important part in
framing of the peace treaty, Dr. Hol
sti shrugged and commented, "That's
for the members to decide."
He refused, smiling, to make any
sort of statements at all on Fin
land's ticklish diplomatic and polit
ical relations with its totalitarian
neighbors because "I am still a mem
ber of the diplomatic service of my
country"; and would only state that,
as far as he could determine, the
newspaper accounts of the Russo-
Finnish war were accurate and un
biased.
DISTINGUISHED CAREER
From 1914 to 1918 Dr. Holsti was
acting professor of political science
at the University of Helsinki, and
was a member of the Finnish par
liament from 1913 to 1918. He en
tered the Finnish government in
1917, and then was appointed diplo
matic representative to the Peace
Conference in 1919.
He served as foregn minister
through four different cabinets from
1919 to 1922, and then took over the
post of temporary representative to
the League. He held the temporary
post until 1927, at which time he
was made permanent minister to the
League. He handled Finnish affairs
in Geneva until 1940, simultaneously
filling the position of foreign min
ister again in 1936 and 1938.
THANKS HOOVER
"We are extremely grateful, the
Finns, to Mr. Herbert Hoover and
his committee for what they have
done for us," he said. "I met Mr.
Hoover in London in '18, and he
then gave us incalculable aid in the
way of foodstuffs and supplies. So,
he knew already how to help us
when the time came again.
"I cannot say that Stanford is bet
ter today than it was in the summer
of 1930 when I taught here last," he
laughed, "because that would imply
that, it was not so good then. I think
it is one of the greatest universities
in the world."

Dr. Holsti will speak at Lunch
eon Club on "The Role of the
Small Nation" at 12:15 o'clock to
day.
The little white card on the door indicates that the office belongs to an
R. Holsti, and that, if you want to see him, his office hours are from 3 to
4 o'clock on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
But the name on that card would mean a great deal to any informed
diplomat—for it was the name R. Holsti who, a year ago, stood in the

Palace of Peace in Geneva and
livered Finland's great appeal to the
League of Nations.
"When the Finnish government,"
he said on that occasion, "asked you
to meet it believed that you might

find some way of transforming
world-wide sympathy for Finland in
to a practical idea. Give us back
peace!"
Dr. Holsti's efforts on behalf of
Finland in part resulted in Russia's
expulsion from the League and the
organization of an unprecedented
scale by the League secretariat of
immediate and practical aid to Fin
land.
LEAGUE'S FUTURE
On the Farm as acting professor
of political' sicence for winter, spring,
and summer quarters, Dr. Rudolf
Holsti, in an interview yesterday,
said that the League circle in Geneva
is "optimistic as regards the future"
of the League.
"We mustn't forget that the League
has great property, that is, the two

post until 1927, at which time he
was made permanent minister to the
League. He handled Finnish affairs
in Geneva until 1940, simultaneously
filling the position of foreign min
ister again in 1936 and 1938.
THANKS HOOVER
"We are extremely grateful, the
Finns, to Mr. Herbert Hoover and
his committee for what they have
done for us," he said. "I met Mr.
Hoover in London in '18, and he
then gave us incalculable aid in the
way of foodstuffs and supplies. So,
he knew already how to help us
when the time came again.
"I cannot say that Stanford is bet
ter today than it was in the summer
of 1930 when I taught here last," he
laughed, "because that would imply
that, it was not so good then. I think
it is one of the greatest universities
in the world."

Dr. Holsti will speak at Lunch
eon Club on "The Role of the
Small Nation" at 12:15 o'clock to
day.
The little white card on the door indicates that the office belongs to an
R. Holsti, and that, if you want to see him, his office hours are from 3 to
4 o'clock on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
But the name on that card would mean a great deal to any informed
diplomat—for it was the name R. Holsti who, a year ago, stood in the

Palace of Peace in Geneva and
livered Finland's great appeal to the
League of Nations.
"When the Finnish government,"
he said on that occasion, "asked you
to meet it believed that you might

find some way of transforming
world-wide sympathy for Finland in
to a practical idea. Give us back
peace!"
Dr. Holsti's efforts on behalf of
Finland in part resulted in Russia's
expulsion from the League and the
organization of an unprecedented
scale by the League secretariat of
immediate and practical aid to Fin
land.
LEAGUE'S FUTURE
On the Farm as acting professor
of political' sicence for winter, spring,
and summer quarters, Dr. Rudolf
Holsti, in an interview yesterday,
said that the League circle in Geneva
is "optimistic as regards the future"
of the League.
"We mustn't forget that the League
has great property, that is, the two
palaces and 80 to 100 million Swiss
francs," he declared. "Roughly, that
is 20 to 25 million dollars, and there
are more than 50 states in the League
whose property it is."
STILL DIPLOMAT
When asked whether, in the event
of a British victory, the League
would play an important part in
framing of the peace treaty, Dr. Hol
sti shrugged and commented, "That's
for the members to decide."
He refused, smiling, to make any
sort of statements at all on Fin
land's ticklish diplomatic and polit
ical relations with its totalitarian
neighbors because "I am still a mem
ber of the diplomatic service of my
country"; and would only state that,
as far as he could determine, the
newspaper accounts of the Russo-
Finnish war were accurate and un
biased.
DISTINGUISHED CAREER
From 1914 to 1918 Dr. Holsti was
acting professor of political science
at the University of Helsinki, and
was a member of the Finnish par
liament from 1913 to 1918. He en
tered the Finnish government in
1917, and then was appointed diplo
matic representative to the Peace
Conference in 1919.
He served as foregn minister
through four different cabinets from
1919 to 1922, and then took over the
post of temporary representative to
the League. He held the temporary
post until 1927, at which time he
was made permanent minister to the
League. He handled Finnish affairs
in Geneva until 1940, simultaneously
filling the position of foreign min
ister again in 1936 and 1938.
