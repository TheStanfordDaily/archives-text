# Vocom to Begin Winter Series
## Group Aims to Make Women Job Minded 
### 
After a quarter of plans, research,
and general undercover work, Wom
en's Vocational Committee emerged
yesterday with an active program to
make 800 Farm women job-minded.
Beginning Jan. 22 with a panel
by seven guest authorities on how
to apply for a job, the committee will
present seven programs for the ben
efit of seniors, juniors and sopho
mores on radio, government service,
journalism, merchandising and per
sonnel. Meetings will be held in the
Nitery at 7:10 o'clock, and all the
women in the University are in
vited to attend.
ANSWER 'EM
The basis for the choice of meet
ing topics was a thousand question
naires distributed and answered last
quarter asking to find the fields
most popular and most important to
undergraduate women. Teaching
headed the list with twice as many
votes as the next vocation, which
was personnel work.
From there the choices fell to
merchandising, secretarial work, and
advertising on down the line. As
a result the Dean of Women's com
mittee, which is under the jurisdic
tion of Women's Conference, will
present special programs in all fields
but teaching and secretarial work,
and have added discussions of gov
ernment service and dramatics for
good measure.
OUR LEADERS
Annabelle Clark, Jcane Cham
bers, and Jeanne Levy are in charge
of the first meeting two weeks from
today. Chairman of the committee is
Widney Watson, with Madeleine
Robb as secretary and Margaret
Terry as treasurer.
Other chairmen for the quarter's
activities are Claire Burtchaell and
Rosamond Upson, dramatic fields
including radio; Ruth Dynes, gov
ernment service; Janet Gould, jour
nalistic vocations including adver
tising; Helen Sehroeder and Jeanne
Levy, merchandising; Elizabeth
Eastman, personnel, and Doris Do
land and Madeleine Robb, choice
of majors for freshmen and sopho
mores.
Not an employment agency, Vo
com was started to help lower di
vision students choose the majors
which will fit them for their work,
and to give upperclassmen an idea
of the problems connected with get
ting a job after graduation.
