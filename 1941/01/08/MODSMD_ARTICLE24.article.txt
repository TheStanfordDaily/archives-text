# Guerard Sees "France Forever"; Offers Plan For "A Lasting Peace"
## Professor Sets Up Five-Point Program For United Europe 
### JOHN HORRALL 
Discrediting such ''appeasers" as
Col. Charles A. Lindbergh and Sen
ator Burton K. Wheeler, Professor
Albert Guerard maintained that "no
negotiated peace can ever exist in
Europe" last night before a Tuesday
Series audience in Memorial Audi
torium.
He ofTered five points on which
a new Europe can be established,
asserting that they can be effec
tive only if they are agreed upon by
both conqueror and conquered.
The main theme of Professor Gue
rard's talk was France's place in a
possible new European federation.
He also discussed the reasons be
hind France's fall.
THE POINTS
His first point toward the con
struction of a lasting peace was the
establishment of equality of status
for the individual. Point two ex
pressed the necessity of liberty of
thought and expression, in such
fields as press, religion, and busi
ness specifically as well as all others.
For his third point he brought
forth a theme that he mentioned
throughout his discussion, that there
must be a liquidation of the imperial
spirit. Point four stressed free trade
within a European federation. His
final and most important point de
manded a federal social legislation
second to none.
DECENT LIVING
Supplementing his final point, he
affirmed that "a world which can
afford preparedness and war can af
ford decent living conditions."
"The main problem which con
fronts the France of tomorrow is
whether or not France will smile
again," he declared. "France is not a
race. It is a language group. France
is all tradition. To me, France is
something elusiveâ€”unassuming and
smiling intellectual courage claim
ing to be neither angel nor beast.
The best of Frenchmen appear to us
with a smile. But will the France of
tomorrow show this same smiling
spirit?"
THREE REASONS
Professor Guerard offered three
reasons for the cause of the recent
"democratic disaster." The first rea
son was, he said, the superiority of
the Germans in technical skill. He
held that England escaped immediate
defeat because God made her an
island.
Reason two placed a blame on the
rightist minority for refusing to co
operate with the leftist majority.
Daladier was weak, but France was
no weaker politically than was Eng
land; it was only more exposed, he
declared.
"If," he declared, "for the past
eight years we had had a new name
each time we had a new Roosevelt,
we would have had as many lead
ers as France had."
The third and final reason for the
democratic disaster was that the
heart of the French Bourgeoise was
on the left, but his pocket was on
fho right. The same was true with
the bourgeoise in all countries, but
the pocketbook won in France.
