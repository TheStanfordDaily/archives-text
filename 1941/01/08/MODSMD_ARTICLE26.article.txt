# Barbey to Head Annual Convalescent Home Drive
## Excom Refuses to Take Initiative In Rose Bowl Ticket Controversy 
### M. J. MONTGOMERY 
Ex Committee last night approved the appointment of Graham Barbey
as chairman of Stanford's own combination of sweet charity and college
a la Hollywood—the Convalescent Home Drive. Last year Ned Pugh
handled the drive, which is always under Cardinals.

DEMOCRACY: Bruce Jessup
ported that most other American i
colleges represented at the National
Student Federation of America
convention, which he attended last
month, reported a higher percentage ;
of voters within the student body I
than Stanford's habitual ballot —
around 50 per cent.
Suggestions by the committee in- |
elude more voting places, longer
hours, and longer, stronger ore
election. The feeling was that this
would not be as effective, perhaps,
as the spectacular campaign stunts
which other schools use to increase
the vote, and which Stanford con
scientiously avoids.
B.A.C. MEETING: Exc :om agreed !
that action in regard to the inade
quacy of Rose Bowl tickets should
come from the Coast Conference and j
the Rose Bowl Association rather \
than from Stanford alone.
Ex Committee expressed gratitude
to A1 Masters for refraining from
validation of tickets at the Big Game
and the Rose Bowl, and for the plans
now under discussion for revising
student body cards to include iden
tification.
FROSII BIBLE: Appointment of
the handbook editor was postponed
until next week since only one ap
plication had been filed.
ATHLETIC AWARDS: Football,
cross country, water polo and soc
cer awards will be approved by tele
phone vote of Ex Committee this
week as soon as they are released by
the coaches and the B.A.C.
N.S.F.A. CONVENTION: Empha
sis of the meeting, like the empha
sis in other colleges, was more on
active interest in national politics
and world problems than on strictly
student affairs, Jessup reported.
Stanford's A.S.S.U. president voted
against affiliation with both the In
ternational Student Service and the
American Youth Congress. Both
moves were defeated because of the
radical reputation of these groups.
THANK YOU: The A.S.S.U.
thanked Pat Smith, Bill Kimball,
and all of Rally Committee for their
work during football season and the
Rose Bowl celebrations.
DATES: Law Association dance,
Jan. 25; Lagunita formal. Feb. 14;
Union dance, Feb. 15; Roble formal,
Feb. 21; Junior Prom, May 2.
