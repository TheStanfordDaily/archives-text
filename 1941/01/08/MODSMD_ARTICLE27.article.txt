BERLIN, Jan. 7 (UP).â€”Three de
structive British air raids on Bremen
last week were acknowledged Tues
day, as Nazi sources were boasting
of widespread successes in renewed
daylight bombing attacks on London
and other points in England.
Several raids on the British capi
tal and other targets were carried
out during Tuesday by the German
air force despite most unfavorable
flying weather, authorized spokes
men said. A railroad freight yard
and an air field north of London
were reported bombed and grounded
planes machine-gunned.
