# Ibsen's Satire To Hit Boards At 8:15 Tonight
## Three-Show Sell-Out Marks First Winter Drama Production 
### 
After a week-end of practically
uninterrupted rehearsals, Stanford's
actors have polished up to a fine
point their forthcoming perform
ance of Henrik Ibsen's "Wild Duck."
The play will hit the boards tonight
at 8:15 o'clock in the Little Theater.
The play, which started rehearsal
last quarter, had to undergo an in
tense period of review after three
weeks of vacation on the part of the
students. Usual procedure of re
hearsals at Stanford entails prac
tice spaced with academic activities.
This time the rehearsals have ap
proached the professional stage with
all-day rehearsals Friday, Saturday,
Monday, and Tuesday.
A NEW RECORD
This is also the first time a play
has been presented so early in the
quarter, and success of the venture
is well-reflected by the outstanding
sale of tickets. Thursday, Friday,
and Saturday are sellouts with only
about 20 tickets left for the opening
performance.
"The Wild Duck" is an apt selec
tion for the opening of the Univer
sity's 50th year since it was written
the opening of the century by Ibsen,
who is generally recognized as the
father of modern drama. From his
work stems most of the contempo
rary drama as seen in the works of
Shaw and Behrman, whose plays
will be given later in the year.
BITTER EXPRESSION
This show may be termed a satir
ical comedy which stresses the bit
ter attitude that Ibsen had toward
the government of Norway at the
time. It was originally written as
almost an allegory with political
significance which has come to be
realized only in the last year.
Ibsen predicted that a lack of in
tegrity among the Scandinavian na
tions would be paid for by the grand
children of his generation. The treat
ment of contemporary problems in
the theater earmarked modern
drama, and was the sourcebook of
future writers.
YOU GUESS
"Hie Wild Duck" is the satirical
sketch of a Norwegian who pays lip
service to idealism. Beyond that,
what the play is about cannot be con
jectured; for few can understand
Ibsen, especially in this play.
Tickets may be obtained by call
ing P.A. 22041 or by calling at the
box office.
