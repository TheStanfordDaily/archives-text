# Make-ups Due Spring Quarter
## Committee Revises Rules on Incompletes 
### 
Because of last quarter's flu epi
demic, the Committee on Scholar
ship has issued new rules governing
the making up of incompletes.
The Committee has voted to ignore
the incompletes until the end of
spring quarter, but any grades not
made up by that time will have the
same effect as if they were failures.
PLENTY OF TIME
This means that although the stu
dent actually has four quarters in
residence to make up the incom
pletes, he runs the risk of incurring
scholarship action (in the case of
Lower Division students) after the
expiration of two quarters.
It is hoped that during the winter
and spring quarters, instructors will
set dates as early as possible when
make-up examinations will be giv
en. The Committee on Scholarship
will accept make-ups even if they
occur during the first three weeks
of the quarter.
INSTRUCTORS FREE
Any instructor wishing to give
make-ups before the published dates
(January 23 to March 21) may do
so. It is suggested that instructors
post notices on the departmental
bulletin boards giving the course
number, date, hour, and place of
each examination.
The Registrar's Office will answer
any questions regarding general reg
ulations governing incompletes.
