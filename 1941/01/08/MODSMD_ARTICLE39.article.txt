# Card Cagers Battle Gaels Tonight at 8
## 
### 
Socking their sixth win of the
current season, Stanford's cagers,
viho hid. fair to he the top outfit
in the southern division of the Pa
cific Coast Conference, take the
court in the Pavilion tonight at 8
o'clock against the Galloping Gaels
from St. Mary's College.
Having downed Hank Luisetti and
the Olympic Club several weeks ago,
the Indians will probably enter the
game as favorites, for the charges of

"Dutch" Conlon, who succeeded the
late Harlan Heebs Dykes as basket
ball mentor at the Moraga institu
tion, were recently walloped by the
Winged "O."
Hot shot for the Gaels is Jackie
Tobin, whom many rate as the flash
iest hoopster in the bay region out
side of the great Luisetti. When St.
Mary's tangled with the Olympians,
it was only the basket-shooting of
Tobin that kept the Gaels in the
game at all.
MAYBE DAVIDSON
It is quite probable that Kenny
Davidson, to whom Coach Everett
Dean usually assigns the toughest
defensive job, will guard the dan
gerous Tobin. Even though defense
is one of Davidson's strongest points,
be is no slouch on offense, having
been the conference's leading guard
in the scoring columns last season,
when the Indians took second spot
in the southern division.
One of the things that makes the
crowd cheer for Davidson is his
faking all the way, even when he is
shooting. However, it has been said
by experts that Davidson's shooting
would be even more effective if he
drew a bead on the basket a few
seconds sooner, instead of faking un
til the very last instant. Be that as
it may, Davidson was stiil the best
guard in the southern division last
year, and promises to repeat this
season.
FOURTH STRAIGHT
Should the Indians cop the deci
sion tonight, they will have run their
current winning streak to four
straight. Only the one-point margin
by which they lost to the University
of Indiana has kept Dean's boys from
having a perfect season to date.
Tonight the Indians will be out
to avenge the defeat the Gaels hung
on them last season, and Williams,
Davidson & Co. should do just that,
unless pre-season dope is all wet.
Stanford's starting line-up will
probably be the same as it has been
in most of this season's games: Don
Williams and Fordy Anderson at
forwards; Don Burness at center;
and Davidson and Bill Cowden at
guards. Likely to see action with the
second five are Jack Dana and Tiff
Denton, forwards; Ed Voss, center;
and John Alltucker and Bob Wen
zel, guards.

The appearance of Number 7 on
the Pavilion floor in the Utah
State and San Diego State games
was due to an unfortunate mis
take. Starting tonight the num
ber, theoretically retired last year
in honor of Hank Luisetti, will he
seen no more.
