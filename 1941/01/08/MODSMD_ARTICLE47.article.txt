IF Trust-Buster Thurman Arnold can iron out
the A.S.C.A.P.-8.M.1. dispute he will earn the
undying gratitude of the listening public. Offi
cials who are involved feel that the struggle
may be settled within two months. But this
appears to be sheer optimism in light of the
bitter controversy that has boiled away since
the networks balked at the composers' demands
for IV2 per cent of the gross yearly income.
As far as trusts are concerned Mr. Arnold
will have little to choose between when he
evaluates the contestants. For all practical in
tents it is a case of one large combination's seek
ing to break the sway of another.
When the broadcasting industry ruined the
sale of popular song hits by reducing their life
(and the revenue from record and sheet music
sales) tremendously, A.S.C.A.P. succeeded in
protecting the composer and his affiliates.
Frankly commercial, the radio networks were
willing to pay for tunes. A.S.C.A.P.'s request
for IV2 per cent represented $9,000,000 —a small
fraction of radio's earnings. And yet far more
than 7V2 per cent of all broadcasting time is
occupied by music—much of it authored by
A.S.C.A.P.
The industry's attempt to destroy a combina
tion—one that had grown inordinately power
ful but whose essential purpose was to protect
artists and publishers from exploitation by a
large commercial interest —led to the formation
of 8.M.1., actually a company union.
So far 8.M.1, has failed to produce songs that
can compare with the vast body of A.S.C.A.P.
music. Most radio listeners will agree to this.
It is true that, potentially, 8.M.1, may be a good
thing. It should provide a medium for unknown
and unrecognized artists to reach the attention
of the public. But, too, its existence is a threat
to legitimate profits which are due competent
musicians and composers.
Radio network broadcasting today is a huge,
unified industry. Its attempt to break a society
that protects artists from exploitation seems
highly unethical.
Yet wherever the greatest truth may lie, the
American public is the loser. The quality of
radio musical entertainment which we now hear
is indisputable evidence of this loss.
