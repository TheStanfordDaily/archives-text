# New Year's Dirge
## 
### 
EXACTLY a week ago the curtain drew over
the year 1940. As the clock ticked off the
minutes of last December 31, horns were blow
ing, people were mingling joyously, glasses
were being tilted at that old 180-degree angle.
A tremendous blast of noise as the hands of
the clock crossed themselves. And the hubbub
continued on into the year 1941, gradually dying
down until in the hours when the street lights
went off there were only a few diehards trying
desperately to make some fun, unwilling to
concede that the merrymaking was over.
But news dispatches from England didn't
reflect any such cheery festivities at the en
trance of a new year. Strict regulations limited
lighting in houses. And it's not easy to be gay,
to drink to the future, when that very future
portends nothing but desolate promises of death
and destruction rained from a relentless enemy.
Even here in the United States, a country not
officially at war, the pace seemed somewhat
tempered from that of usual New Year's festivi
ties. Maybe sixteen and a half million young
Americans, lifting their glasses merrily to escort
in 1941, were subconsciously wondering what
the incoming year had in store for them.
Perhaps the rapid pace of the celebrations
was a partial attempt to forget temporarily a
future that is swiftly becoming more and more
dismal to the young American who last Octo
ber fulfilled his obligation to the Selective Serv
ice Law. And even many younger men, men
who have since passed or are rapidly approach
ing the age that will make them eligible for the
next conscription period, probably paused.
And while death and destruction is being
poured upon millions of persons with whose
aims you sympathize, and while there is the
possibility that your own personal future—as
well as that of your country —is tied up with
that conflict, it is almost impossible for you not
to pause momentarily to consider his place in
the general scheme.

It is difficult to be unequivocally happy, if
such a thing is ever possible, when one's career
depends upon a nearby war and a course of
action being formulated in Washington. There

were many thousands of couples last New
Year s Eve who held hands and wondered
whether the marriage and home they had so
recently contemplated was feasible. Likewise,
there were millions of parents who sadly pon
dered a war-torn world into which they had
reared their children, a world that they had ex
perienced themselves twenty-odd years ago
and never expected to see again.
America's New Year's celebrations were gay
and carefree enough. But millions of persons
halted midway through their festivities to won
der just what 1941 had in store that justified such
a celebration.
And maybe wished that the calendar had
moved back a year instead of forward.—G. M.

recently contemplated was feasible. Likewise,
there were millions of parents who sadly pon
dered a war-torn world into which they had
reared their children, a world that they had ex
perienced themselves twenty-odd years ago
and never expected to see again.
America's New Year's celebrations were gay
and carefree enough. But millions of persons
halted midway through their festivities to won
der just what 1941 had in store that justified such
a celebration.
And maybe wished that the calendar had
moved back a year instead of forward.—G. M.
EXACTLY a week ago the curtain drew over
the year 1940. As the clock ticked off the
minutes of last December 31, horns were blow
ing, people were mingling joyously, glasses
were being tilted at that old 180-degree angle.
A tremendous blast of noise as the hands of
the clock crossed themselves. And the hubbub
continued on into the year 1941, gradually dying
down until in the hours when the street lights
went off there were only a few diehards trying
desperately to make some fun, unwilling to
concede that the merrymaking was over.
But news dispatches from England didn't
reflect any such cheery festivities at the en
trance of a new year. Strict regulations limited
lighting in houses. And it's not easy to be gay,
to drink to the future, when that very future
portends nothing but desolate promises of death
and destruction rained from a relentless enemy.
Even here in the United States, a country not
officially at war, the pace seemed somewhat
tempered from that of usual New Year's festivi
ties. Maybe sixteen and a half million young
Americans, lifting their glasses merrily to escort
in 1941, were subconsciously wondering what
the incoming year had in store for them.
Perhaps the rapid pace of the celebrations
was a partial attempt to forget temporarily a
future that is swiftly becoming more and more
dismal to the young American who last Octo
ber fulfilled his obligation to the Selective Serv
ice Law. And even many younger men, men
who have since passed or are rapidly approach
ing the age that will make them eligible for the
next conscription period, probably paused.
And while death and destruction is being
poured upon millions of persons with whose
aims you sympathize, and while there is the
possibility that your own personal future—as
well as that of your country —is tied up with
that conflict, it is almost impossible for you not
to pause momentarily to consider his place in
the general scheme.

It is difficult to be unequivocally happy, if
such a thing is ever possible, when one's career
depends upon a nearby war and a course of
action being formulated in Washington. There

were many thousands of couples last New
Year s Eve who held hands and wondered
whether the marriage and home they had so
recently contemplated was feasible. Likewise,
there were millions of parents who sadly pon
dered a war-torn world into which they had
reared their children, a world that they had ex
