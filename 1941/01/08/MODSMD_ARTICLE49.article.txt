# BULL SESSION
## 
### BUD AMES 
AND FOR THE FUTURE . . . ?
JYJANY— perhaps a majority of you readers—read
with some interest the History column which Bob
Low writes every day for the front page of The Daily.
Low is a precise and a very logical thinker; he care
fully thinks before he taps out his daily message.
And his results have proven to be surprisingly accu
rate.
Yesterday's Campus Opinion letter writer testified
to that fact when he wrote:
"There is no thought of entrusting the excellent
news commentary, History 1941, or the traditionally
fine major sports reviews to any but the best qualified
writers."
And yet, despite his clarity of thought, Bob some
what desperately blurted out yesterday, "Oh gosh!
I'm not sure if taking all these journalism courses is
going to do me any good. I've been talking with the
navy people; before I know it I may be in the navy."
"That's right, Bob. You know, guys like us can't
tell what's going to happen tomorrow. There's noth
ing you can look forward to with certainty. There's
little you can plan on for certain."
"Yep,'' Bob said. "There's little we can plan on."
* * * *
B°, B „ is no defeatist. Neither are you or you or the
fellow sitting next to you in your 9 o'clock class.
Or the hasher who gets your order wrong and then
jokingly blames it on German sabotage. Or the West
ern Civ professor who alters his lectures frequently—
perhaps more frequently next quarter—in order to
work in a couple of jokes about the way Italians fight
or about the Greek skirts.
Bob expresses a new sort of thought that is fore
most in the minds of younger Americans, those people
whom the Senators call the "leaders of tomorrow."
Such thinking is not healthy. But it can not be
avoided. Like Topsy, it just grows. And grows and
grows. And as it grows it changes—it has changed—
our evaluation, changed our outlook on such intan
gibles as honor and respect—yes, and even God.
* * * *
Y"OU remember the Ten Commandments? Well, re
cently Professor Paul R. Farnsworth of Stanford
conducted a survey among students here at the Farm.
He asked his sample guinea pigs to rate these Ten
Commandments in the order of their importance. The
Commandment which reads: "Thou shalt have no
other Gods before me" was ranged seventh.
"Thou shalt do no murder," which was ranged sixth
in the Bible, was ranked first in the minds of these
students.
"Thou shalt not steal"—ranked eighth in the Bible
—was ranked second by your fellow students.
* * * *
Doesn't that seem to express something? Under
the cloud of war, things like "One God" and "not
take the name of the Lord thy God in vain" seem less
important to young Americans. But things like mur
der and stealing and pillaging—those have become
more important.
Today, tomorrow, more and more, our thoughts are
consciously and unconsciously becoming thoughts only
of murder and stealing and false witness.
This is not supposed to be a sermon. It is just
a feeling which suddenly swelled when Bob said, some
what desperately, "There is little you can plan on for
certain."
Just tab it as war worries.

AND FOR THE FUTURE . . . ?
JYJANY— perhaps a majority of you readers—read
with some interest the History column which Bob
Low writes every day for the front page of The Daily.
Low is a precise and a very logical thinker; he care
fully thinks before he taps out his daily message.
And his results have proven to be surprisingly accu
rate.
Yesterday's Campus Opinion letter writer testified
to that fact when he wrote:
"There is no thought of entrusting the excellent
news commentary, History 1941, or the traditionally
fine major sports reviews to any but the best qualified
writers."
And yet, despite his clarity of thought, Bob some
what desperately blurted out yesterday, "Oh gosh!
I'm not sure if taking all these journalism courses is
going to do me any good. I've been talking with the
navy people; before I know it I may be in the navy."
"That's right, Bob. You know, guys like us can't
tell what's going to happen tomorrow. There's noth
ing you can look forward to with certainty. There's
little you can plan on for certain."
"Yep,'' Bob said. "There's little we can plan on."

B°, B „ is no defeatist. Neither are you or you or the
fellow sitting next to you in your 9 o'clock class.
Or the hasher who gets your order wrong and then
jokingly blames it on German sabotage. Or the West
ern Civ professor who alters his lectures frequently—
perhaps more frequently next quarter—in order to
work in a couple of jokes about the way Italians fight
or about the Greek skirts.
Bob expresses a new sort of thought that is fore
most in the minds of younger Americans, those people
whom the Senators call the "leaders of tomorrow."
Such thinking is not healthy. But it can not be
avoided. Like Topsy, it just grows. And grows and
grows. And as it grows it changes—it has changed—
our evaluation, changed our outlook on such intan
gibles as honor and respect—yes, and even God.

Y"OU remember the Ten Commandments? Well, re
cently Professor Paul R. Farnsworth of Stanford
conducted a survey among students here at the Farm.
He asked his sample guinea pigs to rate these Ten
Commandments in the order of their importance. The
Commandment which reads: "Thou shalt have no
other Gods before me" was ranged seventh.
"Thou shalt do no murder," which was ranged sixth
in the Bible, was ranked first in the minds of these
students.
"Thou shalt not steal"—ranked eighth in the Bible
—was ranked second by your fellow students.
* * * *
Doesn't that seem to express something? Under
the cloud of war, things like "One God" and "not
take the name of the Lord thy God in vain" seem less
important to young Americans. But things like mur
der and stealing and pillaging—those have become
more important.
Today, tomorrow, more and more, our thoughts are
consciously and unconsciously becoming thoughts only
of murder and stealing and false witness.
This is not supposed to be a sermon. It is just
a feeling which suddenly swelled when Bob said, some
what desperately, "There is little you can plan on for
certain."
Just tab it as war worries.
