# Bowl Ticket Sale Hit by Masters
## 
### 
Dissatisfied with the system of
distributing Rose Bowl football game
tickets, A1 Masters, Stanford grad
uate manager, said yesterday he
will seek a revision to provide more
tickets to the competing Pacific Coast
Conference school.
Asserting "No one was satisfied
with conditions existing this year,"
he pointed out that available tickets
for the Stanford - Nebraska game
were sold out within three days
after the sale opened.
Principal sufferers, he said, were
Stanford alumni. It was necessary
to return unfilled more applications
than Stanford was able to fill. He
indicated that at the June meeting
of the Pacific Coast Conference he
will ask elimination or curtailment
of three particular blocks of tickets
â€”the 15,000 on public sale; the 4HOO
allotted to transportation, travel and
hotel groups; and the 4200 which he
said went this year to the press for
use outside the press box.
