r EDITOR, SIR:
Your story of last quarter's "Know Stanford"
contcst, and just by way of keeping the record straight.
"The dramatic clubs which preceded Ram's Head
were known as the Sword and Sandals, the Masquers,
and the Skull and Snakes."
They were, instead, Sword and Sandals, Masquers,
and Barnstormers. Ram's Head was for a time, con
temporary with them. The four societies were then
amalgamated into one, called Stagers.
The present society two years ago discarded the
name of Stagers, took on the name of the old Ram's
Head.
Know Stanford.
