# EVILS OF TOBACCO
## 
### 
r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
There is a very serious danger that we think is
currently ensnaring college students all over the coun
try. It is that of smoking. Physicians and physiolo
gists of any degree of fame are unanimously joining
hands in protest of this nasty, unhygienic habit.
We have been going together for four years now,
find not once has the ogre tobacco crossed our lips.
Believe me, young people, this is responsible more
than any other factor for any bliss we might have
enjoyed.
We traveled down to see the Rose Bowl game and
were absolutely astounded by the number of students
in the Stanford rooting section who were smoking.
Every time that suspense was high, the great majority
of the undergraduates would almost automatically
reach for cigarettes to allay their pent-up emotions.
This strikes us as being highly abnormal. When stu
dents resort to cigarettes as a substitute for their nor
mal outlets, it is time for a halt to be called lest the
country as a whole suffer serious consequences in the
future when these selfsame persons will be running
the nation.
It is our opinion (and this has been borne out by
famous medical men) that tobacco dulls the mental
processes and deteriorates physical emotions. Further
more, there can be no doubt that it is a sloppy habit
in that the ashes fall on one's clothes frequently, ne
cessitating increased bills for cleaning. Also there is
an unhealthy effect on innocent bystanders in that
the smoke blown by the smoker and inadvertently
inhaled by the bystander coats his lungs and shortens
his life.
We have discovered by our constant companionship
that smoking is an absolute evil that must be de
stroyed if the men (and women) of the future are to
produce a strong, alert, intelligent race.
Sincerely yours,
A.R. and R.L.
