TRELAWNY: A Man's Life by Margaret Armstrong.
Following her recent successful biography, "Fanny Kemble," Margaret
Armstrong has turned a mass of historical evidence into another popular
biography, this time the story of Edward Trelawny, a contemporary of

Fanny Kemble's.
Trelawny, of a noble, though im
poverished English family, ran
away from his school at an early
age and embarked upon a series of
adventures that surpass those of this
generation's soldier of fortune, Rich
ard Halliburton.
While still a very young man sail
ing the Indian Ocean he captured a
pirate town in Madagascar. He res
cued the daughter of a sheik and
married her only to lose her by
poisoning. He told her story in his
famous "Adventures of a Young
Man."
BURNS BODY
In Italy Trelawny's friendship
with Percy Shelley ripened into the
greatest experience of his life. After
Shelley's tragic death it was Tre
lawny who undertook the burning of
his body on the beach near Via
reggio.
Fighting with Byron for the free
dom of Greece; living in a cave on
Mount Parnassus with a Greek
chieftain; visiting America, where he
almost lost his life while trying to
swim across the Niagara River; buy
ing slaves in order to set them free
—these were some of the other high
lights of his career.
WHAT A LIFE
Hardy and handsome to the last,
he died at 89, having outlived four
wives. At his request his ashes were
buried beside those of his greatest
friend, Shelley.
With the exception of several sen
tences which contain some very an
tedated expressions, the book makes
for interesting reading, besides
bringing to light many new facts
concerning Shelley and Lord Byron.
