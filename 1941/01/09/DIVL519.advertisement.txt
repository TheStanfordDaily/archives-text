Developing heller apparatus of many kinds at lower cost
is a continuous process in the Bell System. It plays a major
part in making your telephone scrvicc the finest and cheapest
in the world. Here is one of many cases in point:
Above you see two telephone loading coils—one old, one
new. Such coils are spaced at regular intervals along tele
phone circuits. They reduce electrical losses...help to bring
your voice through clearly, strongly over long distances.
Through the years, engineers at Bell Telephone Labora
tories have succeeded in making these coils smaller and
smaller. In so doing, they have greatly reduced the cost per
coil, which...multiplied by the millions in use...has helped
to keep the cost of out-of-town service low. - _
