### BOB LOW 
pRESIDENT ROOSEVELT two
days ago established a new su
per defense board with William S.
Knudsen chairman.
For some time, the cry had been
raised that the national defense
program lacked centralized author
ity and therefore was not progress
ing as satisfactorily as it might.
The President heard this criticism
and now final responsibility rests
with Knudsen.
The new board is to be known as
the Office for Production Manage
ment. Knudsen's subordinates on
the board are Sidney Hillman, asso
ciate director general; Secretary of
War Henry L. Stimson, and Secre
tary of the Navy Frank Knox.
At the press conference at which
the formation of the board was
made public, President Roosevelt
declared that Knudsen would have
complete control over the entire de
fense program.
The President pointed out that
the hoard would have authority to
take over industrial plants which
refuse to co-operate in the pro-
jram.
At the same time a statement is
sued by the new board warned labor
that it must not use "its position im
properly."
In his opening message to Con
gress last week, the President asked
the American people to make the
United States an arsenal for democ
racy everywhere. The new board
intends to see that this is done.
The far-reaching significance of
this policy has not yet been im
pressed upon the American people.
But it may not be long before Amer
icans know that a war economy ex
ists within the borders of the United
States—much as its does within the
borders of the nations actively par
ticipating in war.

MINORITY continues to oppose
the defense program, and some
members of Congress will fight it at
every opportunity.
A little-noticed press dispatch from
Washington yesterday revealed the
character of some of the opposition
which is entrenched in Congress.
Mrs. Roosevelt, wife of the Presi
dent, said she experienced "pro
found shock" when minority mem
bers of Congress failed to applaud
the portion of the President's mes
sage to Congress in which he men
tioned the four points on which he
believed a lasting peace could be
based—freedom of speech and ex
pression, freedom of religion, free
dom from want, and freedom from
fear.
"I thought," she said, "that any
body could applaud those four
principles."
Before she had completed her
comments to the press, the reporters
present broke out into applause, an
almost unprecedented action.
"Surely" she continued, "there
will he differences in the way the
objectives are to he carried out,
hut we must have the objectives at
heart and really care for them.
It must be possible to rise above
personal feelings."
Obviously, there is no reason to
suppose that everyone listening to a
speech of the President of the
United States should applaud at
a given moment as an audience
might be compelled to do in a to
talitarian state. But there is some
thing important in Mrs. Roosevelt's
comments.
She intimates that the administra
tion cannot expect co-operation from
a sizable minority that opposes the
President. In other words, there are
those even in the Congress who
have not yet placed interest in the
nation above personal or political
interests.
The President has asked for co
operation from everyone in making
America an arsenal for the defense
of democracy. Those who oppose
him on this issue either have lost
their faith in democracy or do not
understand the gravity of the pres
ent situation.
Mrs. Roosevelt's words in them
selves were not "played up" in the
newspapers before the American
people; but national defense lead
ers in Washington are aware of the
nature of the opposition which they
must combat to put over the pro
gram.

based—freedom of speech and ex
pression, freedom of religion, free
dom from want, and freedom from
fear.
"I thought," she said, "that any
body could applaud those four
principles."
Before she had completed her
comments to the press, the reporters
present broke out into applause, an
almost unprecedented action.
"Surely" she continued, "there
will he differences in the way the
objectives are to he carried out,
hut we must have the objectives at
heart and really care for them.
It must be possible to rise above
personal feelings."
Obviously, there is no reason to
suppose that everyone listening to a
speech of the President of the
United States should applaud at
a given moment as an audience
might be compelled to do in a to
talitarian state. But there is some
thing important in Mrs. Roosevelt's
comments.
She intimates that the administra
tion cannot expect co-operation from
a sizable minority that opposes the
President. In other words, there are
those even in the Congress who
have not yet placed interest in the
nation above personal or political
interests.
The President has asked for co
operation from everyone in making
America an arsenal for the defense
of democracy. Those who oppose
him on this issue either have lost
their faith in democracy or do not
understand the gravity of the pres
ent situation.
Mrs. Roosevelt's words in them
selves were not "played up" in the
newspapers before the American
people; but national defense lead
ers in Washington are aware of the
nature of the opposition which they
must combat to put over the pro
gram.
pRESIDENT ROOSEVELT two
days ago established a new su
per defense board with William S.
Knudsen chairman.
For some time, the cry had been
raised that the national defense
program lacked centralized author
ity and therefore was not progress
ing as satisfactorily as it might.
The President heard this criticism
and now final responsibility rests
with Knudsen.
The new board is to be known as
the Office for Production Manage
ment. Knudsen's subordinates on
the board are Sidney Hillman, asso
ciate director general; Secretary of
War Henry L. Stimson, and Secre
tary of the Navy Frank Knox.
At the press conference at which
the formation of the board was
made public, President Roosevelt
declared that Knudsen would have
complete control over the entire de
fense program.
The President pointed out that
the hoard would have authority to
take over industrial plants which
refuse to co-operate in the pro-
jram.
At the same time a statement is
sued by the new board warned labor
that it must not use "its position im
properly."
In his opening message to Con
gress last week, the President asked
the American people to make the
United States an arsenal for democ
racy everywhere. The new board
intends to see that this is done.
The far-reaching significance of
this policy has not yet been im
pressed upon the American people.
But it may not be long before Amer
icans know that a war economy ex
ists within the borders of the United
States—much as its does within the
borders of the nations actively par
ticipating in war.

War Henry L. Stimson, and Secre
tary of the Navy Frank Knox.
At the press conference at which
the formation of the board was
made public, President Roosevelt
declared that Knudsen would have
complete control over the entire de
fense program.
The President pointed out that
the hoard would have authority to
take over industrial plants which
refuse to co-operate in the pro-
jram.
At the same time a statement is
sued by the new board warned labor
that it must not use "its position im
properly."
In his opening message to Con
gress last week, the President asked
the American people to make the
United States an arsenal for democ
racy everywhere. The new board
intends to see that this is done.
The far-reaching significance of
this policy has not yet been im
pressed upon the American people.
But it may not be long before Amer
icans know that a war economy ex
ists within the borders of the United
States—much as its does within the
borders of the nations actively par
ticipating in war.

MINORITY continues to oppose
the defense program, and some
members of Congress will fight it at
every opportunity.
A little-noticed press dispatch from
Washington yesterday revealed the
character of some of the opposition
which is entrenched in Congress.
Mrs. Roosevelt, wife of the Presi
dent, said she experienced "pro
found shock" when minority mem
bers of Congress failed to applaud
the portion of the President's mes
sage to Congress in which he men
tioned the four points on which he
believed a lasting peace could be
based—freedom of speech and ex
pression, freedom of religion, free
dom from want, and freedom from
fear.
"I thought," she said, "that any
body could applaud those four
principles."
Before she had completed her
comments to the press, the reporters
present broke out into applause, an
almost unprecedented action.
"Surely" she continued, "there
will he differences in the way the
objectives are to he carried out,
hut we must have the objectives at
heart and really care for them.
It must be possible to rise above
personal feelings."
Obviously, there is no reason to
suppose that everyone listening to a
speech of the President of the
United States should applaud at
a given moment as an audience
might be compelled to do in a to
talitarian state. But there is some
thing important in Mrs. Roosevelt's
comments.
She intimates that the administra
tion cannot expect co-operation from
a sizable minority that opposes the
President. In other words, there are
those even in the Congress who
have not yet placed interest in the
nation above personal or political
interests.
The President has asked for co
operation from everyone in making
America an arsenal for the defense
of democracy. Those who oppose
him on this issue either have lost
their faith in democracy or do not
understand the gravity of the pres
ent situation.
Mrs. Roosevelt's words in them
selves were not "played up" in the
newspapers before the American
people; but national defense lead
ers in Washington are aware of the
nature of the opposition which they
must combat to put over the pro
gram.
