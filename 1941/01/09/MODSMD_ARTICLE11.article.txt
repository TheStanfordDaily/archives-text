# Rush Dinner Will Honor Roble Belles
## Sororities to Issue Second Period Bids Saturday Morning 
### 
Reble lassies will trek up the Row
for dinner this evening to make their
formal how to the Greek letter or
ganizations as the 1941 sorority
rushing period officially begins.
Dr»ssy street-length frocks will be
the rule for both sorority girls and
freshmen tonight, and the Class of
'44 will find this type of dress most
suitable for dinner dates until the
preference period. Quad clothes will
be worn for all luncheon dates.
Bids for this first period, which
includes also lunch and dinner to
morrow and lunch Saturday, were
distributed at Roble by members of
Panhellenic Council during dinner
last night and were returned to the
sorority houses about midnight.
Rushees were allowed to accept no
more than one date with each house
and the same rule will hold true for
the second period.
SUNDAY RUSHING
Second period bids will go out
Saturday morning and this period
includes Sunday dinner and supper
and Monday lunch. Rushing on
Sunday is an innovation this year,
included so that an extra period
which would provide a broader basis
for both house and rushee decisions
might be added.
The third period of rushing will
be made up of Tuesday dinner and
Wednesday lunch and dinner, thus
breaking the tradition of having
Wednesday a "day of silence" be
tween rushers and rushees.
