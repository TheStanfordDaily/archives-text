##

The Winter Quarter program of Men's Vocational Committee will get

living groups on campus.

members of the Vocom today, ac

All fraternities and eating clubs will
be visited, as well as Branner, Toy

The booklets are condensations of
Coca-Cola's famous "The Red Bar
rel," and were printed this year for

the distinct purpose of distributing
them to vocational guidance groups
at colleges and universities. Each

businesses and professions ranging
alphabetically from advertising and
aviation to retailing and wholesal
ing.
Each article is written by a rec

of staff of the U. S. Army, who writes
on "The Army as a Career"; and

control committee of the U. S. House
of Representatives, who writes on
"Public Service as a Career."
The obtaining and distributing of
these vocational books marks the

committee this quarter will include
presenting the Vocational Lecture
Scries, which will begin later this
month, and adding to the Voca

The Winter Quarter program of Men's Vocational Committee will get
under way today with the issuing of over 200 of the Coca-Cola Com
pany's popular vocational booklet, "Your Career," to the various men's
living groups on campus.
The booklets will be presented to the presidents of the living groups by

members of the Vocom today, ac
cording to Chairman Frank 'Mallory.
All fraternities and eating clubs will
be visited, as well as Branner, Toy
on, Sequoia, and Encina halls.
The booklets are condensations of
Coca-Cola's famous "The Red Bar
rel," and were printed this year for

the distinct purpose of distributing
them to vocational guidance groups
at colleges and universities. Each
consists of 24 articles on various
businesses and professions ranging
alphabetically from advertising and
aviation to retailing and wholesal
ing.
Each article is written by a rec
ognized expert in the field. Among
the more familiar names that appear
above "Your Career" articles are
Brig. Gen. L. D. Gasser, deputy chief
of staff of the U. S. Army, who writes
on "The Army as a Career"; and
Robert Ramspeck, chairman of the
control committee of the U. S. House
of Representatives, who writes on
"Public Service as a Career."
The obtaining and distributing of
these vocational books marks the
first function of the Vocom of the
Winter Quarter. Other work of the
committee this quarter will include
presenting the Vocational Lecture
Scries, which will begin later this
month, and adding to the Voca
tional Guidance library.
