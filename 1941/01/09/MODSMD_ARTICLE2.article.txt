# Hoover Libe Tower Gets Belgian Bells
## First Concert Set For June Dedication Of Newest Building 
### 
Ending a long journey over land
and sea, the famous Belgian carillon
arrived on campus yesterday morn
ing. Its installation in the tower of
ihe new Hoover Library of War,
Revolution, and Peace will begin
next month.
A two-trailer truck manned by a
special crew brought the carillon
from San Francisco. It was shipped
by boat from New York. The 35-bell
carillon and playing mechanism,
weighing 20,000 pounds, was trans
ported in 27 crates.
Some time in mid-February Ka
miel Let'evere, carillonneur of the
Riverside Church in New York City,
will travel to Stanford to supervise
its installation. Transporting the
equipment to the tower in the ele
vator and installing it will take
nearly a month, but the work should
be completed about March 15, ac
cording to Dr. Ralph H. Lutz, chair
man of the Library's board of direc
tors.
CONCERT IN JUNE
The first public concert has been
planned for next June, when the
Library will be dedicated. The au
dience for the evening program will
be seated in the Frost Memorial
Amphitheater.
In addition to the carillon, ? three
ton statue of the late King Albert I
of Belgium arrived yesterday in the
same shipment. The statue will be
displayed in one of the exhibit
rooms. Both the carillon and statue
were on display at the Belgian Pa
vilion at the New York World's
Fair.
President Ray Lyman Wilbur ex
pressed the University's gratifica
tion in the Belgian gift.
WILBUR'S STATEMENT
"We take great pleasure in getting
the Belgian carillon as an addition
to the Stanford campus," Dr. Wilbur

activities of Mr. Hoover and Pro
fessor Kellogg in the Belgian Relief
and through the work here of schol

by the Belgian-American Educa
tional Foundation.
"We are very much gratified to
have this characteristic gift in our
possession. It is one we will enjoy
over the years ahead," he concluded.

been presented to Herbert Hoover
by the people of Belgium, "in grati
tude for his services in Belgian re
lief during the World War."
