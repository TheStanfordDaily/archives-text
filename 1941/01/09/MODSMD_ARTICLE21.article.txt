# F.R.'s Budget Reaches Peacetime High; Allied Aid to Increase Figures
## Defense Total Nears 1919 War Appropriation 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jail. 8 (UP). —
President Roosevelt's record peace
time budget of $17,485,528,049 for the
1942 fiscal year brought a flood of
proposals in Congress tonight to
safeguard the economic life of the
nation as it prepares for "total de
fense of democracy everywhere."
The President requested $10.-
811,314,600 additional for prepared
ness and served notice that he will
call for further undetermined bil
lions to aid Great Britain, China,
and Greece in their struggle against
aggression. These expenditures may
skyrocket the overall defense bud
get alone to $20,000,000,000.
DEFENSE FIGURES
Mr. Roosevelt asked $10,800,000,000
for national defense because "the
threatening world situation forces us
to build up land, sea and air forces
able to meet and master any con
tingency."
This figure does not include the
"billions of dollars" worth of war
supplies which he proposes to turn
over to the embattled democracies on
a loan-lease basis—a plan he touched
on only briefly.
Such a program is "essentially
and rightfully" a complement to the
national defense program, he said,
and "would call for appropriations
and contract authorizations over and
above this budget."
Thus, the two programs together
would send the 1942 figure soaring
over the nation's all-time record
mark of $10,998,000,000, the amount
expended by this country's world
war armed forces for one fiscal year
(1919).
NO DISCLOSURES
A noteworthy phase of the mes
sage was the care exercised by the
President in avoiding disclosure of
the exact number of men, planes,
ships, guns and other pertinent in
formation that might be considered
military secrets.
Mr. Roosevelt reported that the
United States has a $28,000,000,000
national defense program on the
basis of appropriations, authoriza
tions and recommendations from
June 1940 through June, 1942.
The chief executive said the United
States actually • will spend "more
than 25 bililon dollars for defense"
within a three-year period.
"This can be accomplished," he
added, "but only if management, la
bor and consumers co-operate."
FIGURE TENTATIVE
Even the $10,800,000,000 national
defense figure must be tentative, the
President warned, "when we recall
the staggering changes in the woi-ld
situation in the last six months. No
one can predict the cost of a project
that is still in development, for no
one can define the future."
In the schedule below figures for
the fiscal year 1940 are actual, those
