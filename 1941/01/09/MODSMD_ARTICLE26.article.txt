### AMIE REICHERT 
By AMIE REICHERT

Waik softly and carry a big stick
when you approach the brown
wooden building across the street
from the Daily Shack. Especially be
wary of the automobiles parked
around the entrance to the building;
they are simply camouflage for the
wild-eyed urchins who pop out at
you, shrilling, "Wanta buy a Quad?
Wanta buy a Quad?"
If you manage to slip through the
lilies, to escape the ever-watchful
tryoutees who wait in ambush out
side, and enter the building, you
are qualified to carry the next mes
sage to Garcia.
IDIOT'S DELHiHT
Inside the Qu;id office, Editor
Chuck Runacres mid Co. are alleged
ly engaged in the business of get
ting out the 1941 Quad in all its
glory. The confusion is exquisite,
Harried photographers dash madly
about, cameras in hand, tryoutees
underfoot. A radio in the corner
playing ihe cream of the 8.M.1, crop
does its best to inform you that
Jeanie has light brown hair, but it's
useless. The agonizing moans of
frustrated copy writers and sales
j men at the Quad office give 8.M.1,
j more competition than A.S.C.A.P.
In the midst of all this, unbeliev
j able as it may seem, some people are
actually working. The editor him
self is up to his wrists in glue past
ing up the senior layouts. There are
i people copying dummies, and there
.ire others filing pictures.
SECOND LINE
Then, too, there's the second line
of offense. Hordes of little people
who jump on you, shouting, "Wanta
I join the business staff?" The idea
being that if the salesmen don't
' get you outside, the staff inside will.
The walls of the office are covered
with calendars and the editor's pet
axioms, such as "Both in knowledge
I and in doubt, always look in the
Bhwlout." There's also a sign over
the entrance to the dark room which
admonishes, "No lipstick, please."
In another corner of the room is
a picture of a smiling dog with his
tongue hanging out over a photo
graph of a smiling girl labeled "Mar
' gie."
The editor, caught between trips
j from his office to the main room,
announced that the '41 Quad will
be quite changed from last year's
book. "We're really hitting that
• anniversary theme a lot," he said.

Publication date for the Quiid,
according to Runacres, is set for
May 20. Progress on the book is
coming along according to schedule,
with some departments far in ad
vance.
Biggest problem in this year's
Quad, according to the staff, was
the business of getting material to
carry out the 50th anniversary
theme. This entailed endless hours
of research in the library, but the
job is finally completed and all
writing for the book has been fin
ished.

The main task before the Quad

Waik softly and carry a big stick
when you approach the brown
wooden building across the street
from the Daily Shack. Especially be
wary of the automobiles parked
around the entrance to the building;
they are simply camouflage for the
wild-eyed urchins who pop out at
you, shrilling, "Wanta buy a Quad?
Wanta buy a Quad?"
If you manage to slip through the
lilies, to escape the ever-watchful
tryoutees who wait in ambush out
side, and enter the building, you
are qualified to carry the next mes
sage to Garcia.
IDIOT'S DELHiHT
Inside the Qu;id office, Editor
Chuck Runacres mid Co. are alleged
ly engaged in the business of get
ting out the 1941 Quad in all its
glory. The confusion is exquisite,
Harried photographers dash madly
about, cameras in hand, tryoutees
underfoot. A radio in the corner
playing ihe cream of the 8.M.1, crop
does its best to inform you that
Jeanie has light brown hair, but it's
useless. The agonizing moans of
frustrated copy writers and sales
j men at the Quad office give 8.M.1,
j more competition than A.S.C.A.P.
In the midst of all this, unbeliev
j able as it may seem, some people are
actually working. The editor him
self is up to his wrists in glue past
ing up the senior layouts. There are
i people copying dummies, and there
.ire others filing pictures.
SECOND LINE
Then, too, there's the second line
of offense. Hordes of little people
who jump on you, shouting, "Wanta
I join the business staff?" The idea
being that if the salesmen don't
' get you outside, the staff inside will.
The walls of the office are covered
with calendars and the editor's pet
axioms, such as "Both in knowledge
I and in doubt, always look in the
Bhwlout." There's also a sign over
the entrance to the dark room which
admonishes, "No lipstick, please."
In another corner of the room is
a picture of a smiling dog with his
tongue hanging out over a photo
graph of a smiling girl labeled "Mar
' gie."
The editor, caught between trips
j from his office to the main room,
announced that the '41 Quad will
be quite changed from last year's
book. "We're really hitting that
• anniversary theme a lot," he said.

Publication date for the Quiid,
according to Runacres, is set for
May 20. Progress on the book is
coming along according to schedule,
with some departments far in ad
vance.
Biggest problem in this year's
Quad, according to the staff, was
the business of getting material to
carry out the 50th anniversary
theme. This entailed endless hours
of research in the library, but the
job is finally completed and all
writing for the book has been fin
ished.
