SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 8 (UP).â€”
The Rev. Edgar Allan Lowther, San
Francisco clergyman, related to a
federal court jury today how he was
bilked of $3400 in the age-old "Span
ish prisoner" swindle, and named
Camillio Lopez Vasquez as one of
the two men involved in the racket.
Accused with Vasquez is Juan
Barrena. They are the first men ever
brought to trial in United States
courts accused of the fabled racket, J
and their attorney said he would
base his defense on the assertion the
men were practically "kidnaped'
from Mexico to face the charge.
Lowther related he flew to Mexico
City last April with his wife and
son, Hugh, where he was met by
Vasquez at the airport. Despite sev
' eral attempts, he was unable to see
I the "prisoner" who was willing to
i pay a fortune if aided in escaping
"unjust imprisonment."
