# Indians Rout Gaels, 51-35
## Tobin Cops Honors With Ten Buckets 
### DON SELBY 
Despite the brilliant efforts of St.
Mary's Jackie Tobin, who rang up
21 points, Stanford added another
victory to ils gradually increasing
win list last night as it defeated
the Galloping Gaels, 51-35, in the
Pavilion.
It was the same old story of a
team being better than an individual
star, for aside from Tohin the Gaels
were only an average ball club,
while Stanford's teamwork gave all
the Indians' shots from close in.
Don Williams and Fordy Ander
son, Stanford's flashy forwards,
were smoothness personified at times
last night as they passed the ball
back and forth under the bucket
just as if the defensive team jvasn't,
there, finally setting the stage for
clear lay-in shots.
CARDS GRAB LKAD
Coach Everett Dean's charges
started the game like a house afire,
piling up 14 points before Tobin's
one-handed shot from 15 feet out
started a Gael scoring spree that
closed the gap somewhat, although
the Indians were still far from be
ing in danger.
Midway in the first half the Gaels
put on a defensive stall, keeping
a light defensive formation around
(he bucket and refusing to come out
to meet the Indian guards. The
Cards soon tired of merely passing
the ball back and forth in back
court, however, and lost the ball
trying to break through to the bas
ket.
Shortly before the end of the first
period Kenny Davidson sneaked
through the defense, took a pass
from Bill Cowden, and tallied from
close in; then Williams tanked a
one-bander from the foul line, which
was followed by Cowden's two good
charity tosses, and Stanford went
into a 31-21 lead as the half ended.
SECOND HALF SLOW
Both teams slowed up perceptibly
in the second half, Stanford scoring
from the floor only eight times as
against 13 field goals tallied in the
first half.
The flashy Tobin was a one-man
bnll club for St. Mary's, sdbring 11
points in the first half, when he was
guarded by Davidson, and 10 points
in the second half, with Cowden
guarding him. He scored all but
four points of his team's second-half
total.
But Stanford had eight men who
could hit the basket and, with An
derson and Williams tallying 13 and
12 points, respectively, the Indians
were never in danger.
Led by Jim Pollard, the most
promising of Coach Beeb Lee's
charges, the Stanford Frosh downed
the Varsity Reserves, 40-36, in the
preliminary contest. Pollard and
Tom Fuller, Reserve forward, tied
for high-point honors with 12 points
each. The game was close all the
way, with the Reserves trailing at
36-34 with five minutes left to play.
At that point Pollard hit the hoop
twice and Dick McDonough added
another to send the Frosh's total to
40, while Fuller's last-minute field
goal failed to bring the Reserves out
of the hole.

Despite the brilliant efforts of St.

21 points, Stanford added another
victory to ils gradually increasing
win list last night as it defeated
the Galloping Gaels, 51-35, in the
Pavilion.
It was the same old story of a
team being better than an individual
star, for aside from Tohin the Gaels
were only an average ball club,

started a Gael scoring spree that

last night as they passed the ball
back and forth under the bucket
just as if the defensive team jvasn't,
there, finally setting the stage for
clear lay-in shots.
CARDS GRAB LKAD
Coach Everett Dean's charges
started the game like a house afire,
piling up 14 points before Tobin's
one-handed shot from 15 feet out
started a Gael scoring spree that
closed the gap somewhat, although
the Indians were still far from be
ing in danger.
Midway in the first half the Gaels
put on a defensive stall, keeping
a light defensive formation around
(he bucket and refusing to come out
to meet the Indian guards. The
Cards soon tired of merely passing
the ball back and forth in back
court, however, and lost the ball
trying to break through to the bas
ket.
Shortly before the end of the first
period Kenny Davidson sneaked
through the defense, took a pass
from Bill Cowden, and tallied from
close in; then Williams tanked a
one-bander from the foul line, which
was followed by Cowden's two good
charity tosses, and Stanford went
into a 31-21 lead as the half ended.
SECOND HALF SLOW
Both teams slowed up perceptibly
in the second half, Stanford scoring
from the floor only eight times as
against 13 field goals tallied in the
first half.
The flashy Tobin was a one-man
bnll club for St. Mary's, sdbring 11
points in the first half, when he was
guarded by Davidson, and 10 points
in the second half, with Cowden
guarding him. He scored all but
four points of his team's second-half
total.
But Stanford had eight men who
could hit the basket and, with An
derson and Williams tallying 13 and
12 points, respectively, the Indians
were never in danger.
Led by Jim Pollard, the most
promising of Coach Beeb Lee's
charges, the Stanford Frosh downed
the Varsity Reserves, 40-36, in the
preliminary contest. Pollard and
Tom Fuller, Reserve forward, tied
for high-point honors with 12 points
each. The game was close all the
way, with the Reserves trailing at
36-34 with five minutes left to play.
At that point Pollard hit the hoop
twice and Dick McDonough added
another to send the Frosh's total to
40, while Fuller's last-minute field
goal failed to bring the Reserves out
of the hole.

Despite the brilliant efforts of St.
Mary's Jackie Tobin, who rang up
21 points, Stanford added another
victory to ils gradually increasing
win list last night as it defeated
the Galloping Gaels, 51-35, in the
Pavilion.
It was the same old story of a
team being better than an individual
star, for aside from Tohin the Gaels
were only an average ball club,
while Stanford's teamwork gave all
the Indians' shots from close in.
Don Williams and Fordy Ander

were smoothness personified at times
last night as they passed the ball
back and forth under the bucket
just as if the defensive team jvasn't,
there, finally setting the stage for
