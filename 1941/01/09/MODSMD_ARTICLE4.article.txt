### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 8 (UP).
President Roosevelt today asked
Congress for new taxes to help de
fray costs of the multi-billion dollar
preparedness program and for leg
islation to intensify the drive to
prevent "war millionaires."
Discussing the nation's fiscal poli
cies in his annual budget message,
he vigorously opposed putting de
fense expenditures on a pay-as-you
go basis. That could be accom
plished. he said, only through "very
drastic and restrictive taxation
which curtails consumption."
