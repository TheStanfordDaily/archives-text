# Farm Skiers Plan First Snow Trip
## 
### 
All reservations for this week
end's trip by the Ski Club must be
made by today noon at the A.S.S.U.
office. This is the first trip of the
season and weather conditions in
Yosemite promise excellent skiing.
Membership cards are now on sale
at the A.S.S.U. office for $1.50. When
presented with a student body card
they entitle the holder to special
half rates on the upskis, buses, and
rental of all ski equipment. Ski
Club pins, though not required, are
on sale at Smith's in Palo Alto.
Besides the prospect of good ski
ing—there is 5 feet of snow on
Badger Pass—Stanford students can
look forward to an evening of din
ner and entertainment at the Awah
nee Hotel on Friday night as guests
of the Yosemite Winter Club.
