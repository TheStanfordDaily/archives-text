\ LONG about this time of year
comes usually the doldrums of
sports. With football shelved until
August, and with baseball stars loaf
ing around for the most part, accu
mulating fat to be worked off in the
training camps in a couple of
months, the field of holler, hurray
and hoopla drops into a semi-coma.
Since news <if the howl games
drepped oIT the front pages of (he
nation's sport pages, athletic ad
jective slingers have been dig
ging pretty deep for stuff to fill
the columns. The best example
that comes to mind is the guessing
games the San Francisco papers
have been playing in trying to
name the opening of the Albany
racetrack across the bay.
This glorified mud fight has
rated top spots in the Chronicle, Ex
aminer, News, etc., and from the
looks of things now it may serve as
i steady source of news right up to
the time when the baseball hold-out
stories come into season.
But, from the looks of things
down here on the Farm, things won't
too dull for the next couple of
months. Ordinarily as high a degree
of excitement isn't generated by
basketball games as by the more
publicized gridiron sport, but with
the fine team Coach Everett Dean is
presenting this season, you and you
and you will have to forget about
studies for another quarter and
come down to the Pavilion to watch
an outfit which promises to be the
best cage aggregation in these parts
since Luisetti and Co. ruled the
Coast.

[ JURING the late Christmas vaca- j
tion, the Indian hoop detail made
a better-than-fair record in games |
nlayed in the Civic Auditorium in J
San Francisco.
Their most notable achievement j
was a decisive win over the Olympic j
Club quintet in a game that marked
the return of Hank Luiselti to the
amateur courts. The great Luisetti
tanked 20 points in the game, but it
wasn't enough to overcome the j
smooth-passing teamwork of the !
squad wearing the colors of his old J
school.
The only loss the Deanmen have
suffered all season came at the j
hands of a highly regarded Indiana
cage outfit. The Hoosiers, consid
ered one of the top teams in the na- !
tion, eked out an overtime 60-59
win over an Indian club suffering
from the absence of Fordy Ander
son.
Don Williams rang up the highest j
individual point total for a Stanford
eager so far this season in the Ne
braska game in late December.
Willy hit the hoop for 24 digits, the
same number tanked by Luisetti j
against St. Mary's in the first game |
of the double bill.

r IMIE squad seems to be even
better equipped for the Con- \
ference hoop scramble than it was j
last winter, when it gained second j
place in the Southerh Division
standings.
Williams is the best shot-maker
of the starting five, but at that he's
not far ahead of the rest of the
team. Fordy Anderson's sensational
ball-stealing tactics lead to a lot of
field goals and keep the opposition
perpetually worried.
Don Burness and Dick Taylor give j
the squad two fine pivot men. Bur- '
ness is somewhat the smoother ball j
handler of the two, and has been 1
getting the starting call most of the !
time, but Taylor's height and his ex- i
ceptional speed for a big man are i
going to make him mighty useful
; against some of the tall teams of the
i conference.

In Kenny Davidson and Bill
Ccivden, Coach Dean has two of
the host guards anyone could ask
fur. Both are fine defensive play
ers, good .».!i<:ts, and efficient in
taking the l»a!l cfT the hackhoard.
Last year's squad had a good deal
of trouble because of lack of reserve
strength, an ailment from which this
club should be relatively free. Bob
Wenzel, Bob Penn, Jack Dana, Ed
Voss and Till Dt nton are on hand
to spell the starters and should
profit by the experience they have
been getting in the past few games.

r J I ME Indians will show their wares
attain in Sun Francisco Satur
day night, when they meet the San tit
Clara Broncos. The Broncs took a
cross country trip during vacation,
and compiled an impressive record
against top competition.
On the Coast the Santa Clarans
rank with Stanford, U.S.C., and a
couple of the Northwest teams as
the cream of the casaba crop.
A.S S.IJ. cards will he honored
at Civic Auditorium, lint it might
he wise to get there early in order
to get a seat. With the return of
Hank Luisetti to the courts, bas
ketball has taken hold up in the
city, and the Indian-Krone lilt
should pack the place.
