# An Empty Gesture

DEMOCRACY has one very peculiar charac
teristic. Because of constitutionally guar
anteed rights of free speech, any man can be
heard. And if he is celebrated enough he can
make his voice sound completely out of pro
portion to the importance of the view he is
representing.
A graphic example of this fact is Senator
Burton K. Wheeler, Montana's very competent
and sincere isolationist leader. At this time
when an overwhelming majority of the Ameri
can people are devoted to the task of preparing
this country physically, industrially, and mor
ally for any eventuality, Senator Wheeler has
persistently disapproved of almost all measures
relating to the President's foreign policy.
And because Wheler's record in Congress is
so outstanding, his comments always receive
widespread recognition. This may be fair
enough in consideration of his record as a Con
gressman. But nevertheless it cannot be denied
that Wheeler represents an infinitesimal minor
ity of the American people, and the publicity
his views receive blows this minority into a
prominence it does not deserve.
Recently in a radio address Mr. Wheeler pro
posed an eight-point working basis toward a
peace that should be negotiated immediately
between the warring countries. Almost every
newspaper in the nation carried reports of the
talk in conspicuous places on their front pages.
Mr. Wheeler's eight points are as follows:
1. Restoration of Germany's 1914 boundaries
with an autonomous Poland and Czechoslo
vakia.
2. Restoration of independent France, Hol
land, Norway, Belgium, and Denmark.
3. Restoration of Alsace-Lorraine to France.
4. Restoration of German colonies.
5. Protection of all racial and religious mi
norities in all countries.
6. Internationalization of the Suez Canal.
7. No indemnities or reparations.
8. Arms limitations.
Even if peace could be arranged at the pres
ent time, as Senator Wheeler suggests, it seems
absolutely incredible that a German-dominated
Axis would subscribe to the majority of these
points—especially the first three and the fifth.
Only the most optimistic of persons could pos
sibly believe that Germany would ever cease
hostilities at the present time and agree to a
plan such as Wheeler's.
It seems remarkable that a man as conscien
tious as Senator Wheler could stand so whole
heartedly in the way of President Roosevelt's
foreign policy, and yet offer so inadequate a
substitute.—G. M.
