WINTER quarter and The Daily could not
be complete without the anual editorial
about the library parking lot.
With the season's precipitation it has attained
its usual condition of viscosity. Now that the
storm has lapsed into that long interim of grey
days that will stretch until the next deluge, it
lies stagnant and sluggish, its placid surface
stirred only by the passage of an occasional
car or the peregrinations of a foolhardy but cour
ageous traveler on foot.
It is fed by several tributaries and, so far,
science has been unable to detect any visible
outlet. Like Lake Tahoe, its depths have never
been plumbed.
The Corporation Yard has been petitioned
time and again to drag it for bodies of persons

who have wandered into its morass on dark
nights. It is expected that this quarter's de
crease in enrollment is directly attributable to
the loss of life occasioned by tidal waves that
have trapped victims on isolated sandbars and
washed them into the surrounding wilderness.
The student guide service has been forced to
employ two extra men to conduct the new in
flux of visitors past the spectacle. Life-belts are
provided all sightseers in the fear that an espe
cially large wave might engulf them.
Librarians who live in the southern or eastern
part of Palo Alto and must approach their work
by way of the quagmire have all made down
payments on motor boats. Students in Encina,
Branner, and Toyon employ either water wings
or row-boats, depending upon their economic
status.
Late last night it was authoritatively rumored
that the Coast Guard was thinking of establish
ing a base.
