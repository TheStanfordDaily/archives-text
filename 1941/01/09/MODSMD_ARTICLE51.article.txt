fIVERY so often—and that's enough—the University
collects all its agents and big operators together
for a monstrous effort. And then, abra-kadabra, just
like that, they publish a book or pamphlet or some
thing like that concerning the termite problem in the
San Joaquin Valley, or the life and death of a Coca-
Cola class.
Well, sir, just as regular as clock work, the Uni
versity came out not so long ago with a little book
which looks like a cross between a Bawlout and a
Bingo-Bank Night, and which bears the vicious title of
"Report of the Students' Organizations Fund." And
because it is just cram-packed full of rows and rows
of complex figures and because it is a University pub
lication few of you will probably ever take the trouble
to look it over.
So we took the liberty of hunting and pecking
through its 150 pages, with the view of bringing to
light a few facts which, in the interest of science, bet
ter living, and all that propaganda stuff (sound of fan
fare off stage) must, yea verily, must find voice.

(pause for effect) students—your lead
ers are corrupt.
Kind of a good sentence, eh? Bet you read on.
Yes, students, a quick glance at the "Return Check
Account" betrays what has been going on. Pi'inted
in that section are the names of many campus lead
ers—that man next to you may be one—who have been
using dubious means to obtain funds.
Look at the record of Mary Etta Farrell. On the
surface she's the treasurer of Cap and Gown, the
Women's Editor of The Daily, and senior sponsor in
Roble. But look, look in the book. Printed right there
is her name with a check for five whole dollars which
was redeemed because drawn on the wrong bank.
Ain't that awful?
And there's Anne Townsend. Well, your honor, on
the surface Anne is vice-president of the A.S.S.U. But
the book shows that Miss Townsend had a check for
$3.09 redeemed because of insufficient funds. Corrup
tion. Corruption. Who knows how far this thing has
gone. The .next time it may be $3.50. And the next
time $3.65. Hold on to yourself now. You've just got
to go on and read the truth.
And Frank Bush, the business manager of The
Daily, the man through whose horny fingers passes
all the Daily's gold—your gold, brothers and sisters—
well, Bush is in this litte book for a $3 check which—
we must use the bitter word "bounced" because of
insufficient funds. What has been going on behind the
locked doors of the Daily office?
* * * * ,
a tear on your cheek. Well, what must be
must be. But it doesn't stop there. There are more
and more names.
There's Bill Janss, and Encina Club, and Toyon
Club, and Scott Dudley, the swimmer, and Brad Young,
the Gaieties singer, and—oh heaven, even the Tri
Delts are in on this one. Oh, heavens! Yes, and you'll
even find the name of one of Stanford's professors of
agricultural economics. But you'll have to rustle up
a copy and<read the rest of the details for yourself.
We just can't go on (crumbles, sobbing, to the floor).
For us—it's back to Jersey City and Mayor Hague,
where life is clean.
