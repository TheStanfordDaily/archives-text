JAVA JIVE

yHE EDITOR, SIR:
Back in the days when a student body card was
an innocuous piece of pasteboard that didn't entail
a third degree grilling and an F. 8.1, investigation, back
in the days when The Daily was not so frenziedly
enmeshed in the controversial issues of campus power
and politics, there arose a man of the people, a friend
of the common man to voice the plea of the little
people for a 5-cent glass of tomato juice.
Those were the days when the little things in life
counted. Our perspective was not blurred by the
grandeur and glory that was the Wow Boys. So, we
got our five-cent tomato juice.
Well, this is a plea again for a little justice in the
Cellar with special reference to the coffee situation.
No, we're not asking for a three-cent cup of Java;
that nickel price is fine with us so long as the brown
fluid in the cup is coffee and not a reasonably accu
rate facsimile. But, to endure the tortures of drink
ing what tastes unquestionably and uncomfortably
like burnt peanut shells and with no more than this
to fortify one, to go out into the blustry winter and
make one's way to an 8 o'clockâ€”this is too much to
bear and be silent even if there are larger, more vital
issues occupying The Daily's editorial columns.
So let the Cellar heed the hand-writing on the wall,
and take on a load of dated coffee.
Cap'n Henry
