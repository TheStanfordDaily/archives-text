HPHE EDITOR, SIR:
I was deeply impressed by the letter which ap
peared in the Campus Opinion column yesterday with
reference to the evils of tobacco. Such an attitude is
highly commendable in view of the fact that some of
the guiltiest tobacco offenders can be found on the
Farm.
As a companion to yesterday's excellent testimo
nial, I should like to say a word in behalf of the tee
totalers in our midst. Certainly alcoholism is a tre
mendous detriment to student health and morals, and
scientists have discovered that it deadens student
brains so that they are unable to cope with text
books. 8 o'clocks, and other tribulations which require
alert, fresh intellects.
Furthermore, alcohol not only burns holes in your
clothes, but your innards too. Can't something be done
about the rampant delinquency of Stanford students in
this respect? Why doesn't The Daily print a series of
Crusading editorials against the greatest threat to the
moral fiber of American youth?
