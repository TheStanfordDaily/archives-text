# Stanford Players Capture Tragic Tone of Ibsen Play
## 
### AUDREY STEELE 
"The Wild Duck," by Ilenrik Ibsen, being presented in the Little Theater
tonight, Friday and Saturday at 8:15 o'clock by the Stanford Players.
It was with regret that your reviewer had to leave the opening per
formance of "The Wild Duck" last night with two acts as yet unplayed,
in order to meet a press deadline. For the Stanford Players were doing
a good job on Henrik Ibsen's
act drama. Iww _ ___ _

The actors met the mood of the
Norwegian tragedian from the be
ginning of the vehicle and were
carrying it to the right pitch, as at
the end of the third act, Gregers
Werle, played by Hal Millen, and
dubbed as afflicted with a bad case
of integrity, was determined to in
form Hjalmar Ekdahl (Asher Wil
son) of his tainted life.
PORTRAY INNUENDO
At its best, Ibsen's strange con
glomerate of idealism and realism is
difficult and challenging to handle.
Dana Winters as Old Ekdahl, Hjal
mar's father, and Alladine Bell as
Gina Ekdahl, Hjalmar's wife, dis
played their cognizance of the hid
den yet all-important strains of in
nuendo in their well-characterized
delivery.
Lines were muffed in a few places,
but of course that is nothing that
cannot be smoothed over for the
remaining three performances. Of
ten, too, I felt that some of the
lines were hurried, which is again
a technical defect easy to correct.
IBSEN REALISM
Sometime in a college student's
academic experiences he is bound
to be exposed to Ibsen, generally
named the father of modern drama.
Therefore it hardly seems necessary
to retell the plot of "The Wild
Duck." It suffices to mention that
the threads of the story are woven
about the lives of two families â€”one
which remains rich and suffers, the
other which falls to poverty and suf
fers also.

Realism of the tragedy of the life
of a child born from illicit love, an
old man imprisoned and broken
spirited, a namby-pamby bewildered
ne'er-do-well, and a half arrogant,
half sincere idealist is the backbone
of the play. Here Ibsen is not the
mystic of "The Master Builder" nor
the convention breaker of "The
Doll's House." Here the Norwe
gian playwright is dull, sad, and
horribly real.
GOOD CHARACTERIZATION
Frank Burt, who took over the
part of Werle in place of Ted Mar
cuse, was good, the quick change
apparently making no difference.
Hedvig, the Ekdahls' daughter, who
so significantly was affected with
weak eyes like the elder Werle, was
played by Emily Ruth. The part
was done in character. However,
may a humble reviewer offer a small
suggestion? A more simple costume
would be much easier on the eyes
and the imagination.
Betty Howe, as Mrs. Sorby, Werle's
housekeeper, was sufficiently ob
noxious. Relling, the doctor, played
by Adolfo Arias; Molvik, the theo
logian, played by Quentin War
ren; Graeberg, portrayed by Rob
ert Libott, and the waiter and din
ner guests were all in excellent
character.
Direction was by F. Cowles Strick
land. Sets were by William Bas
sett and wardrobe by Anne Mead
ows.
