### 
Because he fears being mistaken
for a British propagandist, Dr. Ru
dolph Holsti, new political science
professor, refused to say whether
Finland would prefer German or
Russian dictatorship in answer to a
question raised after his speech to
the Luncheon Club yesterday noon.
Dr. Holsti spoke on "The Role of the
Small Nations."
"I do not want to break faith with
the American public by attempting
to answer such a question," said the
the former Finnish foreign minister.
"I am still a member of the Finnish
diplomatic service."
Dr. Holsti, who .served as Finland's
representative on the League of Na
tions Council, emphasized the power
which the small nations exercised in
the League. Scandinavia with its 30
million population had ap many
votes on League action as the
whole British Empire composed of
450 million people. This greater rep
resentation of the smaller nations
made it possible for them to control
the world powers.

"As representative of Finland, I
was always consulted by the great
powers on matters of policy before
action was taken," Dr. Holsti re
lated. "The large nations never at
tempted to dictate to the little
countries."
