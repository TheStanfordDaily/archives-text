will win the war." 1
That phrase has been one of
Hitler's master propaganda slogans
of the present European conflict.
One need only turn to the pages
of Mein Kampf to learn of Hitler's
personal theories on the art of prop- ■
aganda, and at the present time one
can see his theories in operation by ■
analyzing carefully the utterances of
Nazi spokesmen in Germany and of
Nazi sympathizers in the United
States.
"Germany is invincible." That is
only part of the great propaganda
barrage which Hitler is throwing
upon the world.
Prime Minister Winston Church-
ill said yesterday that at last the
legend of Axis invincibility has been *
smashed.
It was an important statement,
because Nazi propaganda has been 1
so forceful as to convince many 1
Americans that in reality the Ger
mans were a superior warring 1
people who would eventually beat 1
any enemy. To point out that the '
Germans are not invincible is to
say that Britain will win the war. 1

r J , HERE are not a few American
business leaders who have hesi- '
tated in co-operating to the fullest i
extent in our national defense pro- 1
gram because they believed that
Germany would beat England and
then America would be compelled
to do business with the Nazis. Nat- 1
urally, these men have not wanted
to show anti-German feelings when
it was probable that in the near
future they would be dealing with
Germany—if the German govern
ment so wills.
Business men in this frame of
mind have taken the supposed long
range view that it was better to stay
on good terms with the Nazis if it
would place them on a sort of "pre
ferred list" after a German victory
and a German peace.
The thought has been expressed
among leading executives in the au
tomobile industry, for instance, that
to deal with a victorious Germany
would be expedient and beneficial
to their workers and themselves.
"Business as usual, Nazis or no
Nazis in Germany" has been their
reasoning.
They have believed Germany
would win.
But it is of the utmost importance
that these men, above almost all
others, should not be carried aw°.y
by the legend of German invinci
bility; these men must work now in
the belief that they are supporting
a cause that will win out in the
end.

Vt/HAT these men have not been
able to understand is that they
will not be able to do business with
Germany if Germany wins the war.
American costs of manufacture will
place American prices far above Ger
man prices on comparable goods, for
Germany has already demonstrated
that she will not hesitate to use
slave labor if necessary.
German war industries have al
ready employed imported Polish
workers at absurdly low wages
and there is every reason to sup
pose that these same workers
could he forced to work in in
dustrial plants after the conclu
sion of a German pcace. How
could American manufacturers
compete against this practice?
The President's message to Con
gress asked the American people to
subordinate everything, if neces
sary, to the national -defense pro
gram. The country is now com
mitted to a policy to prevent a Ger
man victory.
Prime Minister Churchill inti
mated yesterday, too, that Britain's
ability to beat Germany might de
pend upon realization of this plea—
upon the extent to which Ameri
cans would subordinate their own
interests to the national interest at
the present time. He said bluntly
that British success depends upon
American aid.
So, it is hoped that the smashing
of Axis invincibility in Africa will
indirectly stimulate co-operation in
national defence on the part of
some of those who up to the present
have hesitated for fear of a German
victory.
