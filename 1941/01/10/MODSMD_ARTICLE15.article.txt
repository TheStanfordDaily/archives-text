LONDON, Fri., Jan. 10 (UP). —
Atfer a three-day lull, the German
air force scattered bombs in vir
tually every section of Britain last
night and early today, leaving
casualties and destruction in one of
its most widespread offensives.
Some of the planes attacking Lon
don apparently were heavy bombers
flying extremely high to stay out of
reach of the defense guns. Others
seemed to be speedier fighter-bomb
ers streaking over at a lower alti
tude in the teeth of the gunfire.
A terriffic explosion and vivid
white flash in the sky over a south
England area shook houses 10 miles
distant. Observers believed a Brit
ish gunner had scored a direct hit
on a German plane, exploding its
bombs.
