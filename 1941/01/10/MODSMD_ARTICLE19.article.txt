# Defense Leaders Pave Way for Introduction Of Loan-Lease Bill Today
## Extraordinary White House Session Held; Private Corporation Plan 'Discarded,' Senate Leader Claims 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 (UP). —An extraordinary White House con
ference late today cleared the way for introduction in Congress tomorrow
of legislation to turn over "billions of dollars" worth of war supplies to
Great Britain and other embattled democracies under President Roose
velt's loan-lease proposal.
General agreement on a bill was reached after a 45-minute conference

.between Mr. Roosevelt and Cabinet,
Congressional, and defense chiefs.
Details were not revealed immedi
ately but it was understood the idea
of a quasi-private corporation to
handle the loan-lease plan had been
discarded in favor of a direct grant
of authority to the war and Navy
Departments.
Companion bills embracing the
plan will be introduced simulta
neously tomorrow at noon by Sen
ate Majority Leader Alben W.
Barkley and House Democratic
Leader John M. McCormack, two of
the White House conferees.
"There is nothing like that in the
bill," Barkley told newspapermen
regarding the Corporation proposal.
With the corporation plan defi
nitely eliminated, it was believed
the bill would seek to give the
Army and Navy—whose com
mander-in-chief is Mr. Roosevelt
—full authority to provide all-out
material aid to Britain.
There were reports the first re
quest for cash to carry out the loan
lease plan might be anywhere from
two to five billion dollars. This re
quest possibly might be contained
in the impending measure.
CASH NOT ON HAND
In that event the bill would
merely be an authorization to spend
money for munitions, planes and
ships for Britain and the other be
leaguered democracies. Actual cash
appropriations would have to come
later.
Reports circulating in congres
sional quarters are that the program
will amount to as much as ten bil
lion dollars.
EXTRAORDINARY SESSION
The extraordinary conference be
gan at 3:30 p.m. after Mr. Roose
velt's weekly Cabinet meeting. The
five Cabinet members remained in
the President's office, apparently dis
cussing in detail the legislation nec
essary to translate into action his
pledge to Britain, Greece and China.
The legislative conferees arrived at
5 p.m.
Knudsen, first to leave, declined
to comment on the bill, explaining:
"I am not in the legisaltive busi
ness and I'm not so good at it. I am
in the material end."
FEW SPECIFIC CLAUSES
There was no intimation how the
legislation will function — whether
contracts between the United States
and benefitting governments would
be required or whether such con
tracts would provide specific means
for repayment, etc.
