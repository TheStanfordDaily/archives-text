Towers reassured Congressmen

defense production.
UP TO CONGRESS

time" legislation will be presented

Rep. James W. Mott, R., Ore., said
during the ensuing discussion of la

time of this emergency if the em
ployers and labor haven't enough
patriotism or interest in their coun
try to get together, it is up to Con
gress to do something."
Vinson replied the probem was the
responsibility of Congress.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 9 (UP). — I
Carl Vinson, chairman of the pow
erful House Naval Affairs Commit
tee, served notice Thursday that
Congress is prepared to get tough
with anybody or anything that in
terferes with national defense.
He sounded the warning during a
committee inquiry into rearmament
production lags after naval aero
nautics chief John H. Towers testi
fied that a strike is imminent at a
plant making 1,900 military aircraft
engines.
NO PRODUCTION LAGS'
Production and labor chiefs Wil
liam S. Knudsen and Sidney Hill
man, joint heads of the new super
defense agency, warned Tuesday
that all activity must be subordi
nated to the defense effort.
In connection with Vinson's dis
closure Congress would act against
any interference with the defense
program, it was recalled Towers
had revealed to the committee
Tuesday the Navy Department is
preparing legislative recommenda
tions designed to eliminate produc
tion lags. He said the recommenda
tions would include changes in the
Walsh-Healy Act which sets labor
standards for work on certain fed
eral contracts.
Towers reassured Congressmen
that this country's secret bomb
sight has not been released to any
foreign power.
In answer to a question, he con
ceded that there were "millions and
millions of dollars" worth of ma
chine tools idle, but he added that
they are "specialized tools" which in
most cases can not be adapted to
defense production.
UP TO CONGRESS
Vinson warned "at the proper
time" legislation will be presented
to deal with labor situations that
delay production.
"Congress is not going to sit qui
etly by and permit anything to in
terfere with the procurement and
delivery of the defense program,"
he said.
Rep. James W. Mott, R., Ore., said
during the ensuing discussion of la
bor situations in defense that "in a
time of this emergency if the em
ployers and labor haven't enough
patriotism or interest in their coun
try to get together, it is up to Con
gress to do something."
