# Farm Shortens Engineer A.B. To Aid Defense
## University to Offer Summer Courses For Three-year Plan 
### 
In answer to the rapidly increas
ing demand for engineers in the
Army and in the expansion of in
dustry for national defense pur
poses, Stanford will arrange for stu
dents to earn the A.B. degree in en
gineering in three years instead of
the traditional four, it was an
nounced today.
In order to make this possible, the
University will, for the first time,
offer courses in engineering during
the summer quarter. Attendance in
summer will enable high school
graduates with proper preparation to
complete the regular 12-quarter
(four years) course for the degree
in three years.
The new program is not abbre
viated, but is the regular full-time
four-year training condensed simply
by the expedient of using summer
sessions, it was emphasized. It will
make it possible for many students
to graduate within their twenty-first
year, and to have the value of an
engineering education uninterrupted
by military duty.
At least four years of undergrad
uate work can be completed, under
the new plan, before the youth is
inducted into military service, which
under present conditions of mechan
ized warfare has so many demands
on engineering talents.
Stanford heretofore has offered
only surveying courses in the sum
mer, while some other engineering
schools have provided summer
courses for the benefit of advanced
students. Stanford, however, is pio
neering in offering a program of
study which has been shortened in
the length of time required for its
completion, but not in content, for
the specific purpose of meeting na
tional defense needs.
