# Anne Lindbergh Fortells Failure Of 'Crusades'
## 
### DIXON ADAMS 
"The Wave of (he Future," by Anne Morrow Lindbergh; Harcourt,
Brace and Company, New York.
For its length, "The Wave of the Future" has probably caused more
of a stir among the reading public than any other volume in recent years.
For what more controversial subject could Anne Lindbergh choose than
A,the war?

These 41 short pages are sub
titled "A Confession of Faith," but
they confess to very little faith. The
subject is introduced by way of the
sixth century Roman philosopher
Baethius, who, in an age "when
the established world was cracking
...and a dream of civilized order
and unity was dying," sat and asked
himself questions which were be
sieging his mind.
'WHOSO SEEKS THE TRUTH'
And Anne Lindbergh, on her first
page, quotes from Boethius: "And
therefore whoso seeks the truth,
shall find in no wise peace of
heart.'" This quotation sets the
whole tone of her faith for Europe.
During her years in Europe Mrs.
Lindbergh was exposed to the con
flicting points of view which are now
battling each other in the field, and
she frankly and honestly states that
she cannot see this war as a "cru
sade" on the part of either side.
The world should have corrected
the abuses that caused Communism
and Fascism, but the world was
filled with lethargy and was blind,
and has consequently been brought
to its knees, "if we do not better
our . . . democracy, there will be
no use trying to 'save' (it) by fight
ing; (it) will crumble away under
the very feet of our armies." We
had best correct the abuses at home
which abroad made a revolution, un
fortunately violent as it may be, an
historical necessity. A "crusade" in
Europe will not correct them.
PRO-AMERICAN IDEALS
Anne Lindbergh has, especially
since the appearance of this book,
been called everything from "anti-
American," "anti-British," to "pro-
German" by excited interventionists.
The truth is that upon no statement
in her book can anyone call her
"anti" or "pro" anything, unless it
be "pro-American."
The only difference between Anne
Lindbergh and most "pro-Ameri
can" people these days is that she
understands what has happened
abroad, understands that Fascism is
not merely an "accident," and has
some practical, wise suggestions for
this country to avoid the same path
as Europe.

"The Wave of (he Future," by Anne Morrow Lindbergh; Harcourt,
Brace and Company, New York.
For its length, "The Wave of the Future" has probably caused more
of a stir among the reading public than any other volume in recent years.
For what more controversial subject could Anne Lindbergh choose than
A,the war?

These 41 short pages are sub
titled "A Confession of Faith," but
they confess to very little faith. The
subject is introduced by way of the
sixth century Roman philosopher
Baethius, who, in an age "when
the established world was cracking
...and a dream of civilized order
and unity was dying," sat and asked
himself questions which were be
sieging his mind.
'WHOSO SEEKS THE TRUTH'
And Anne Lindbergh, on her first
page, quotes from Boethius: "And
therefore whoso seeks the truth,
shall find in no wise peace of
heart.'" This quotation sets the
whole tone of her faith for Europe.
During her years in Europe Mrs.
Lindbergh was exposed to the con
flicting points of view which are now
battling each other in the field, and
she frankly and honestly states that
she cannot see this war as a "cru
sade" on the part of either side.
The world should have corrected
the abuses that caused Communism
and Fascism, but the world was
filled with lethargy and was blind,
and has consequently been brought
to its knees, "if we do not better
our . . . democracy, there will be
no use trying to 'save' (it) by fight
ing; (it) will crumble away under
the very feet of our armies." We
had best correct the abuses at home
which abroad made a revolution, un
fortunately violent as it may be, an
historical necessity. A "crusade" in
Europe will not correct them.
PRO-AMERICAN IDEALS
Anne Lindbergh has, especially
since the appearance of this book,
been called everything from "anti-
American," "anti-British," to "pro-
German" by excited interventionists.
The truth is that upon no statement
in her book can anyone call her
"anti" or "pro" anything, unless it
be "pro-American."
The only difference between Anne
Lindbergh and most "pro-Ameri
can" people these days is that she
understands what has happened
abroad, understands that Fascism is
not merely an "accident," and has
some practical, wise suggestions for
this country to avoid the same path
as Europe.
