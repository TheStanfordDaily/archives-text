ATHENS, Friday, Jan. 10 (UP).—
Greek forces, fighting with bayonets
in the snow-covered mountain re
gion on the northern Albanian front,
have stormed Italian fortified posi
tions and captured Fascist ski troops,
a government spokesman reported

An undisclosed number of the Al
pine troops also were trapped while
attempting to escape when Greek
Evzones flanked a high peak and
surrounded them, the spokesman
said.
200 PRISONERS
A Greek war communique re
ported that important enemy posi
tions were taken at bayonet point,
resulting in the capture of 200 Fas
cist soldiers and much war ma
terial.
United Press Correspondent Nich
olas Yoker with the Greek army in
the north confirmed the trapping of
the Alpini. He reported the Italian
retreat began when the Greeks laid

Greek infantry then moved up
hill through snow which cut visi
bility to a yard or two and trapped
the ski troops.
CAPTURE VILLAGES
The government spokesman said
j the Greeks captured several addi

I four days, he said, and have fallen
! back to newly prepared defenses
protected by masses of barbed wire.
The spokesman said Greek planes
sighted Italian transports, troops
and guns, apparently intended to
reinforce the sectors where the Ital
ians have suffered the heaviest losses
1 recently. Greek airmen dived low
! and machine-gunned Italian col
: umns, while bombers blasted at the
i lines of motor trucks and mules.
