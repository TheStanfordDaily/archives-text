# SHIP SEALERS PICKET
## 
### 
PORTLAND. Ore., Jan. 8 (UP).â€”
Pickets threatened two big Port
land industries today but work went
on as usual in both. Members of the
CIO Ship Scalers Union began pick
eting the port of Portland dry
docks, where two government
dredges and a lumber schooner are
undergoing repairs and the oceanic
terminal, where the Willamette Iron
and Steel Company is converting
two ships into troop transports for
the Navy.
