# Interfraternity Head Reports
## Wendell Willkie Talks At Greek Convention 
### 
A full report on activities of the
thirty-second annual Interfrater
nity Conference, Nov. 28-30, in New
York City, at which Wendell L.
Willkie was the principal speaker,
was released yesterday by Pete
Whittlesey, Interfraternity president.
Whittlesey attended the conven
tion in company will Bill Weeden,
Interfraternity secretary.
Thirty-six hundred delegates were
present, representing CO fraternities,
comprising 2,452 chapters and 850,000
living members.
LAUDS UNITED SPIRIT
As guest speaker, Mr. Willkie,
Beta, said:
"The fraternal spirit in America
is a functioning of the democratic
process. In the college fraternities
men learn to discuss without acri
mony, to reform without vindictive
ness, and to live with each other in
peace and accord for the accom
plishment of a unified spirit."
He also declared in the course of
his adddress that it is as necessary
for America to give aid to Britain
as to build armaments for itself.
THOMAS PRESIDES
Lowell Thomas, famed news com
mentator and Kappa Sigma, was
master of ceremonies and, according
to Whittlesey, Mr. Thomas and Mr.
Willkie enlivened the meeting by
snappy repartee.
Recommendations included less
frequent national conventions, co
operative buying and accounting (in
operation at Stanford), repairs on
chapter houses which will reduce
operating expenses, giving parents
information as to the financial op
eration of the chapters, and the en
couragement of alumni to assist
chapters financially and with ad
vice.
IMPROVEMENT URGED
L. G. Balfour, re-elected chair
man, Sigma Chi, warned:
"Beware of being self-satisfied.
Do not let our achievements of to
day, outstanding as they may be,
obscure our desire to improve our
position in the future. Never should
we be wholly satisfied with our pre
vious accomplishments. Rather we
should use them as stepping stones
to higher achievements in the fu
ture."
