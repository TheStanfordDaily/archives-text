### 
OAKLAND, Jan. 9 (UP).—Lloyd
Mangrum of Chicago's Oak more
Country Club showed his heels to
a brilliant field of more than 200
touring golfers today by galloping
over the soggy Sequoyah Country
Club course for a 67 to lead the first
round of play in the $5,000 Oakland
Open Tournament.
Mangrum had the advantage of a
late start, for a steady north wind
dried the course considerably after
noon and the cards of the afternoon
players averaged two strokes better
than the morning golfers.
Mangrum's 67 was three under
par for the 6,000-yard course. He
scored a 33 on the out nine and 34
coming home, including birdies on
the fifth, ninth and 14th holes.
