# Series to Show South Sea Film

Depicting the native life of Fiji,
| the lamed South Sea island, "Fiji,
Cannibal Land of Yesterday," an all- j
j color motion picture by Herbert E.
Knapp, cinematographer, world
| traveler and lecturer, will be
screened next Tuesday for the Tues
day Evening Series.
Mr. Knapp will lecture along with
j the movies. The picture was filmed
j entirely in the South Seas. In
cluded in the many fascinating and
j unusual scenes of native life is an
amazing record of the mysterious
i rite of fire-walking. For years sei- i
| entists have puzzled over this in
i credible feat and many of them dis- '
i pute its authenticity.
The movie records every aspect of
j this ancient ceremony, and Mr.
Knapp believes that his shots, which
j include a close-up examination of
the fire-walkers' feet after the rit
i ual, prove conclusively that no
i trickery is used.

At the opening of the University
insuperable objections were found
to the placing of telephones in the
President's office and in Encina Hall.
