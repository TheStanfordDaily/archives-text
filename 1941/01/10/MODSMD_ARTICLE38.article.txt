# Cagers Set To Konko Bronco
## Coast Hoop Titans Meet Tomorrow 
### 
In their tliird game this week,
Stanford's baskethallers — six - time
winners in seven games played—
take the court tomorrow night at 8
o'clock against the Santa Clara
Broncos in San Francisco's Civic
Auditorium.
The Papoose cagers tangle with
Commerce High School at 6:30
o'clock in the preliminary.
With a good quintet last season,
the Indians ran into the Broncs on
one of the latter's hot nights and
came out on the short end of a 42-

out to even the count with the cag

EASTERN RECORD
And anyone who thinks that Stan
ford won't have any trouble in
hanging up a victory needs only to
look at the record of wins piled up
by the Broncs on their recent barn
storming tour in the East and Mid
west to change his mind. For Coach
George Barsi's speedy quintet took
on some of the best teams the East
has to offer this winter and came
home with a record of three games
won out of five played.
First, they waxed City College of
New York, 49-41, and followed with
a 57-28 walloping of Franklin and
Marshall University. Then the
Broncs dropped two in a row as La-
Salle and then Duquesne hung de
feats on them by scores of 41-35 and
42-40, respectively. But the Coast
ers finished strong with a 43-39 win
over DePaul University's hitherto
undefeated five in a game that really
boosted the stock of Pacific Coast
basketball as far as th& Midwest
was concerned.
FIVE STRAIGHT
Before they started their eastern
tour, Santa Clara's hoopsters won
five straight games.
So it isn't hard to understand why
Santa Clara should enter tomorrow
night's contest no worse than an even
choice to emerge the victor.
The man that should give the In
dians the most trouble is Jim Rick
ert, lofty center, who has led the
Broncs in scoring this season. Be
cause George Barsi took only nine
men on the eastern tour, Rickert had
to play almost all of every contest,
which should mean that he will be
in condition to go the route against
Stanford.
HALE THREATENS
If the Cards spend too much time
watching Rickert, however, they
may find that one Bruce Hale, who
rated with Hank Luisetti and Don
Burness as one of the best cagers
to be turned out of San Francisco's
prep schools, will be peppering the
hoop. Hale hit a shooting slump the
early part of this season because of
an ankle injury.
The Bronc-Indian tussle may
prove to be one of the fastest bas
ketball games seen in the Civic Au
ditorium this year, for Santa Clara's
fast break has been one of its most
effective weapons against eastern
teams, and the Indians have used
the same tactics to good advantage in
most of the games they have played.
CLEVER. TOO
When they run up against Don
Williams, Fordy Anderson, and
Kenny Davidson coming down on
fast breaks, however, the Broncos
are liable to see more clever ball
handling and footwork than they
have yet had to cope with, for this
trio of Indians make up one of the
smoothest - functioning, fast - break
units seen in the Pavilion in many
a moon.
The probable starting line-up for
the game:
Stanford Santa Clara
Anderson F Hale
Williams F Passaglia
Burness C Rickert
Cowden G Feerick
Davidson G Mangan

EASTERN RECORD
And anyone who thinks that Stan
ford won't have any trouble in
hanging up a victory needs only to
look at the record of wins piled up
by the Broncs on their recent barn
storming tour in the East and Mid
west to change his mind. For Coach
George Barsi's speedy quintet took
on some of the best teams the East
has to offer this winter and came
home with a record of three games
won out of five played.
First, they waxed City College of
New York, 49-41, and followed with
a 57-28 walloping of Franklin and
Marshall University. Then the
Broncs dropped two in a row as La-
Salle and then Duquesne hung de
feats on them by scores of 41-35 and
42-40, respectively. But the Coast
ers finished strong with a 43-39 win
over DePaul University's hitherto
undefeated five in a game that really
boosted the stock of Pacific Coast
basketball as far as th& Midwest
was concerned.
FIVE STRAIGHT
Before they started their eastern
tour, Santa Clara's hoopsters won
five straight games.
So it isn't hard to understand why
Santa Clara should enter tomorrow
night's contest no worse than an even
choice to emerge the victor.
The man that should give the In
dians the most trouble is Jim Rick
ert, lofty center, who has led the
Broncs in scoring this season. Be
cause George Barsi took only nine
men on the eastern tour, Rickert had
to play almost all of every contest,
which should mean that he will be
in condition to go the route against
Stanford.
HALE THREATENS
If the Cards spend too much time
watching Rickert, however, they
may find that one Bruce Hale, who
rated with Hank Luisetti and Don
Burness as one of the best cagers
to be turned out of San Francisco's
prep schools, will be peppering the
hoop. Hale hit a shooting slump the
early part of this season because of
an ankle injury.
The Bronc-Indian tussle may
prove to be one of the fastest bas
ketball games seen in the Civic Au
ditorium this year, for Santa Clara's
fast break has been one of its most
effective weapons against eastern
teams, and the Indians have used
the same tactics to good advantage in
most of the games they have played.
CLEVER. TOO
When they run up against Don
Williams, Fordy Anderson, and
Kenny Davidson coming down on
fast breaks, however, the Broncos
are liable to see more clever ball
handling and footwork than they
have yet had to cope with, for this
trio of Indians make up one of the
smoothest - functioning, fast - break
units seen in the Pavilion in many

Williams, Fordy Anderson, and
Kenny Davidson coming down on
fast breaks, however, the Broncos
are liable to see more clever ball
handling and footwork than they
have yet had to cope with, for this
trio of Indians make up one of the
smoothest - functioning, fast - break
units seen in the Pavilion in many
a moon.
The probable starting line-up for
the game:
Stanford Santa Clara
Anderson F Hale
Williams F Passaglia
Burness C Rickert
Cowden G Feerick
Davidson G Mangan
In their tliird game this week,
Stanford's baskethallers — six - time
winners in seven games played—
take the court tomorrow night at 8
o'clock against the Santa Clara
Broncos in San Francisco's Civic
Auditorium.
The Papoose cagers tangle with
Commerce High School at 6:30
o'clock in the preliminary.
With a good quintet last season,
the Indians ran into the Broncs on
one of the latter's hot nights and
came out on the short end of a 42-

EASTERN RECORD
And anyone who thinks that Stan
ford won't have any trouble in
hanging up a victory needs only to
look at the record of wins piled up
by the Broncs on their recent barn
storming tour in the East and Mid
west to change his mind. For Coach
George Barsi's speedy quintet took
on some of the best teams the East
has to offer this winter and came
home with a record of three games
won out of five played.
First, they waxed City College of
New York, 49-41, and followed with
a 57-28 walloping of Franklin and
Marshall University. Then the
Broncs dropped two in a row as La-
Salle and then Duquesne hung de
feats on them by scores of 41-35 and
42-40, respectively. But the Coast
ers finished strong with a 43-39 win
over DePaul University's hitherto
undefeated five in a game that really
boosted the stock of Pacific Coast
basketball as far as th& Midwest
was concerned.
FIVE STRAIGHT
Before they started their eastern
tour, Santa Clara's hoopsters won
five straight games.
So it isn't hard to understand why
Santa Clara should enter tomorrow
night's contest no worse than an even
choice to emerge the victor.
The man that should give the In
dians the most trouble is Jim Rick
ert, lofty center, who has led the
Broncs in scoring this season. Be
cause George Barsi took only nine
men on the eastern tour, Rickert had
to play almost all of every contest,
which should mean that he will be
in condition to go the route against
Stanford.
HALE THREATENS
If the Cards spend too much time
watching Rickert, however, they
may find that one Bruce Hale, who
rated with Hank Luisetti and Don
Burness as one of the best cagers
to be turned out of San Francisco's
prep schools, will be peppering the
hoop. Hale hit a shooting slump the
early part of this season because of
an ankle injury.
The Bronc-Indian tussle may
prove to be one of the fastest bas
ketball games seen in the Civic Au
ditorium this year, for Santa Clara's
fast break has been one of its most
effective weapons against eastern
teams, and the Indians have used
the same tactics to good advantage in
most of the games they have played.
CLEVER. TOO
When they run up against Don
Williams, Fordy Anderson, and
Kenny Davidson coming down on
fast breaks, however, the Broncos
are liable to see more clever ball
handling and footwork than they
have yet had to cope with, for this
