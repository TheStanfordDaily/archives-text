### JERRY BRUCKER 
TUST a couple of days ago we officially closed the football season and
pi omised not to mention the subject again. At the time we solemnly
intended to stick by that statement, but now something has come up that
we feel the readers (the fellas up at the house) might like to know about.
Hugh Gallarneau, under-publicized Indian halfback during the past
season, will next fall join the ranks of ex-Stanford stars performing on
the gridirons of professional football.
The Duke has not signed a contract with any team yet, but unless
somebody throws a mighty lucrative desk job his way between now
and next fall, he 11 play football for either the Chicago Rears or the
New York Yankees.

A s THE leading ground gainer of the undefeated "Wow Boys," Hugh
would be a valuable addition to either team.
The Bears, National Pro League champions this year, drew Gallarneau
in the annual draft of college senior stars. After the Rose Bowl game,
Hugh talked to George Halas, owner-coach of the Bears, but no definite
arrangement was made.
Gallarneau also has a letter from the New York Yankees, a mem
ber of the smaller American Professional Football League. This league
id made up, for the most part, of the smaller cities in the East.
The Yankees do not have to conform to the draft restrictions the Bears
are subject to and appear to be conducting a raid on the source of Na
tional League material. Recently John Kimbrough, the Texas A. & M.
star who beat out Norm Standlee on the All-American lists, gave out that
his best offer from a pro club came from the Yankees.

r J I HE Yankees appear ready to lay a good deal of dough on the line to
get a good ball club. The American Pro League doesn't seem to have
a chance to rival the older National circuit, so just what the New York
club is trying to accomplish is rather obscure.
Perhaps they're trying to put together a squad that will win
enough publicity to enable the New York club to take over one of
the weaker National League franchises and go info competition with
Steve Owen's Giants. Chicago is the only city that has two National
Pro League clubs, and it hasn't worked out so well in that (own in
spite of the lack of competition from a major college team in the city.
* * * *
Be that as it may, Gallarneau is sitting tight at the moment, but will
almost certainly accept the offer of one of the two teams.
Of the two teams, he'd rather play with the Bears, because they are
an established club with a strong following, and because they play the
same brand of football that Clark Shaughnessy's squad used. But if the
Yankees can overbid the Bears by a substantial amount, he may pass up
the National League to play for the other outfit.
One thing, Hugh doesn't have to worry about being drafted for a while.
He appeared before the local draft board and obtained at least temporary
exemption because of dependentsâ€”and it's not what you're thinking; he
and his sister support his mother.

to a rumor (at least it's only a rumor to us) Freddie Meyer
won't be back to play end for the Indians next fall. Some Army
quartermaster is slated to drag Fred off to camp come June, according to
present dope.
With Bosco Graff graduating, this means that Jim Lawson will have to
develop a couple of new ends to take the place of a duo that often looked
like the best flankmen on the Coast.

who can drag themselves away from the food trough in time to
go up to the Santa Clara-Stanford basketball game Saturday eve might
find themselves looking at the best hoop battle to be seen around here
this season.
Santa Clara has a very highly ranked quintet this year, and if
Everett Dean's team can overcome the rather enervating effect of
three walk-over victories in a row. there'll be goings on up at the
Civic Auditorium that won't be forgotten for some time.
For details as to place, time, and admission, see the hoop yarn by Don
Selby in the neighboring columns. If you can't make it Saturday you'll
still be able to see the second game between the two teams to be played
here later this month.
