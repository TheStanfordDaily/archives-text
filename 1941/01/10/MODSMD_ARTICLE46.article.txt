Stanford's forgotten men went
hack to work yesterday.
They're the guys that are out for
rugby, which was once the leading
sport at Stanford in the good old
days of the Santa Clara Valley.
It seems the game is too import
ant, with its brilliant past, for a
minor sport; too unimportant, with
football so well established, for a
major sport; so the boys get out
there and work just for their love
of the game and a gaudy traveling
jacket.
It's going to be pretty hard for
Frankie Albert, who was on every
body's All-American, Pete Kmeto
vic, who wound up the grid season
kissing movie actresses, and the
other glory-laden football men who
are turning out for rugby, to get
used to working for nothing, but
Coaches Harry Maloney and Jim
Wylie think that the championship
of the Rugby Union and the Inter
collegiate League will be enough of
a goal to work toward even if no
awards are given.
Rugby is one tough game and is
often played in sloppy weather. The
only attraction is the rough going.
