Just as he was about to address
! the ball a messenger boy elbowed
through the crowd and shoved a
telegram into his hand. It ordered
him to report to his draft board on
Jan. 15 for military service.

pounds, had tied for the Open
Championship in 1940 with Lawson
Little and Gene Sarazen but was

Phoenix Open tournaments during
the winter.
