# The 						Right to Object
## 
### 
DEMOCRACY has one peculiarly magnifi
cent characteristic. Because of constitu
tionally guaranteed rights of free speech, any
man can be heard. Beyond that right comes the
native privilege of man to think—and to draw
his own conclusions.
This is a point of view to which I adhere. But
in recent newspaper comment on the radio
proposed "peace plan" of Senator Burton K.
Wheeler, a rather different vein of thought has
been expressed.
Recent comment dealing with Senator Wheel
er's radio talk expressed surprise and concern
that (1) the suggestions of a man who "repre
sents only an infinitesimal minority of the
American people" should receive so great pub
licity, and (2) that a man of Wheeler's promi
nence and integrity "could stand so whole
heartedly in the way of President Roosevelt's
foreign policy without offering an adequate
substitute."
Roosevelt and Wheeler both want peace. The
President named an all-out "defensive-offen
sive" as the only way that America could bring
the olive branch to Europe.
Wheeler desires the same conclusion—peace.
But he feels that the Roosevelt-inaugurated, war
courting policy should be used only as a last
resort. And he expresses the wish of countless
fellow Americans that other avenues for peace
would be explored before embarking on the
sea of rough words and rougher international
behavior.
Intense national preparedness, yes. But not
what amounts to a practical declaration of war
until we have tried every other avenue of peace.
Wheeler has been standing "whole-heartedly
in the way of President Roosevelt's foreign
policy" in the way that a thinking man in a
democracy stands "whole-heartedly" for his
convictions. Free speech, until time of war
necessitates its eclipse, is perhaps the greatest
bulwark of our democratic precepts. The men
who seemingly clog the wheels by their un
responsiveness to coercion from above are the
men who assure this guarantee.
The Montana Senator is characterized as "sin
cere," "competent," and possessing widespread
recognition for his work in Congress. Can such
a public servant be criticized for failure to be
come an administrative puppet?
Too bad Senator Borah is gone.—W. C.

Recent comment dealing with Senator Wheel
er's radio talk expressed surprise and concern
that (1) the suggestions of a man who "repre
sents only an infinitesimal minority of the
American people" should receive so great pub
licity, and (2) that a man of Wheeler's promi
nence and integrity "could stand so whole
heartedly in the way of President Roosevelt's
foreign policy without offering an adequate
substitute."
Roosevelt and Wheeler both want peace. The
President named an all-out "defensive-offen
sive" as the only way that America could bring
the olive branch to Europe.
Wheeler desires the same conclusion—peace.
But he feels that the Roosevelt-inaugurated, war
courting policy should be used only as a last
resort. And he expresses the wish of countless
fellow Americans that other avenues for peace
would be explored before embarking on the
sea of rough words and rougher international
behavior.
Intense national preparedness, yes. But not
what amounts to a practical declaration of war
until we have tried every other avenue of peace.
Wheeler has been standing "whole-heartedly
in the way of President Roosevelt's foreign
policy" in the way that a thinking man in a
democracy stands "whole-heartedly" for his
convictions. Free speech, until time of war
necessitates its eclipse, is perhaps the greatest
bulwark of our democratic precepts. The men
who seemingly clog the wheels by their un
responsiveness to coercion from above are the
men who assure this guarantee.
The Montana Senator is characterized as "sin
cere," "competent," and possessing widespread
recognition for his work in Congress. Can such
a public servant be criticized for failure to be
come an administrative puppet?
Too bad Senator Borah is gone.—W. C.
DEMOCRACY has one peculiarly magnifi
cent characteristic. Because of constitu
tionally guaranteed rights of free speech, any
man can be heard. Beyond that right comes the
native privilege of man to think—and to draw
his own conclusions.
This is a point of view to which I adhere. But
in recent newspaper comment on the radio
proposed "peace plan" of Senator Burton K.
Wheeler, a rather different vein of thought has
been expressed.
