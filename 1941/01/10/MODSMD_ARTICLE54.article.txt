EX COMMITTEE thought about it for a while.
And Betty Avery and Jim Mack talked about
it for a while. Now there's a rule in the books
that says, "Every committee chairman must use
the activities card files for selecting his workers
this year."
That regulation has gone into effect this quar
ter. Already several groups have been chosen
from the file. Office hours have been estab
lished in Old Union and the men's and women's
chairmen are willing to co-operate at all times
with harassed chairmen seeking workers and
would-be workers who have been tardy in
submitting their names to the office.
Activities card file began as a dream—a
dream of a practical democracy, organized so
that every student member of the University
community might take part in campus extra
curricular life according to his inclination and
ability. People said it wouldn't work—that it
was idealistic and fantastic to believe that com
mittees could be picked from a metal filing case,
that interests and capabilities could be classified
in such an orderly fashion that a chairman
could find the men and women he sought.
But this year's activities card file proponents
have created a large and highly complete list
ing. With the appointment of Graham Barbey
as Convalescent Home Drive chairman will be
gin the task of selecting the A.S.S.U.'s largest

group of workers. And only those persons
whose names are classified in the activities card
file will participate in committee work for the
remainder of the year.
Ample time still remains for all who missed
earlier appeals to have their names included
in the steadily growing catalogue of Stanford
men and women who wish to benefit from extra
curricular enterprise and whose interests permit
the inclusion of some work in the cause of stu
dent democracy.
