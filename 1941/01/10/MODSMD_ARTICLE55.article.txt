HELP, ROBBER, THIEF!

r JpHIS doesn't seem to be the opportune moment to
break out into a conversational rash over "the
hopelessness of it all" or "your corrupt campus lead
ers," so the second best thing to do is to hash over
the Bookstore situation.
There's always something that can be said about
good old Bookstore. If you're particularly interested
in picking up a few trenchant quotes concerning just
what John Q. Public thinks about your home of the
pad-and-pencil, just drop into the Cellar and grab
yourself a nickel slice of chocolate-coated ev»«-drop
ping.
"We was robbed. Look at that second-hand book.
It's smaller than a demi-tasse and dirtier than the
grounds keeper at Albany race track, and still they
charged me $3.75 for it—plus 11 cents tax. What a
jip!"
* * * *
AS a matter of fact, that her or that she was prob
ably not jipped.
And this information comes straight from the head
of one of Stanford's departments, and a man who, in
his spare moments, is a stockholder in your Book
store. Well, readers, yesterday this man made a state
ment which goes further toward clearing up this gen
eral distaste for the Bookstore which is felt by many
on the campus.
"The Bookstore's failure," he said, "lies for the
most part in its directors' failure to let the campus
and the students know what they (the directors) are
doing."
He then went on to explain that the prices pen
ciled in the second-hand books are, to the best of his
knowledge, as low as is possible. But the Bookstore
never took the trouble to have published any state
ments making this fact known or outlining their sec
ond-hand book policy. As a consequence, since you
and you don't know what is going on, there is a nat
ural rise of that suppressed suspicious nature.
# * * *
still bigger is the complaint against the Book
store's present rebate system. If the directors had
publicized this system more thoroughly and had ex
plained its inner workings more carefully, the num
ber of campus complainers would undoubtedly drop
close to that well known nil.
You don't like to save all those slips, and lug them
over at the end of the year.
But what most of you don't understand is that this
system grew as a result of a survey made in most of
the Pacific Coast's big universities. And now, because
you do all the figure work yourself, the Bookstore
saves over $2000 in accounting charges every year.
This money comes back to you in rebates and in
scholarships.
So now let's wind up this whole thing by saying
that the Bookstore had nothing to do with this little
chit-chat. This is an appeal to the Bookstore direc
tors that they, in the future, spread the good word
around more liberally, that they pump a little pub
licity into the Bookstore's veins. Up with publicity;
down with unnecessary suspicion.

All right, all right; so you still were robbed! Tell
it to the Bookstore.
