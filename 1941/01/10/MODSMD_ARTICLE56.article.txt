HE GIVES A DAMN

r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
Perhaps a few Campus Opinion readers noticed
an article which appeared during that hectic period
last quarter between Big Game and Finals. It was
signed E.G.E. and mentioned something about the
apathy of Stanford students toward that little skir
mish across the water. So far, I've read two answers
directed to E.G.E.—both with the attitude, "So what,
and who gives a damn?"
Wednesday brought forth similar comments by
Bud Ames on the same subject to the effect that there's
little these days that we can plan on.
Now, I don't know exactly what E.G.E. is trying
to do, but I sense a certain rebellion he has against
the general campus plague of "What the hell can
we do? It's not our business; we didn't start it."
I agree with Ames, Low and all the rest of the
student body that we can't tell exactly what's going to,
happen tomorrow, but I DO believe there's a great
deal we can do about it—for ourselves.
First, there is more to indicate that we, the U.S.A..
are going to be in that trouble over there (only it's
going to be over here by then), than there is saying
we arc not. The draft is at work right now on men
between 21 and 36. The Navy is equipped for war
conditions with war time crews on every ship and full
battle equipment. The Army is doing its best to mod
ernize and expand.
In spite of all this, the Third Termer was good
enough to temporarily exempt college students from
the draft, because the college training was felt to be
more valuable. Now, I may be slightly haywire but
it's my impression that F.D.R. said Stanford could
stay open till June because he expects to get officers
and leaders from men in our classrooms.
So, here's my gripe. Kids from high school and men
from civilian jobs are being trained now to be buck
privates to follow orders of their superiors and learn
the art of bliztkrieging. Their superiors are to be col
lege students (who else?) who will in time become
commissioned officers due to their superior knowledge
and training.
Yep, we're the guys who are supposed to be the
leaders, the men to help direct the battle, and to co
ordinate business at home for war-time conditions.
Yet, what are we doing now to train ourselves for the
job? Are we going to lead or be led?
We are continuing our college education like Uncle
Franklin said we should, but are we, in addition, sub
sidizing our knowledge with studies of the military or
ganizations of this country, and how cach one of us
becomes a part of the Army, Navy, or Marine Corps.
Personally, I'd like to see a little interest on the
part of the student body as a whole, boys and girls
alike, on what this military talk is all about. We have
an Army and a Navy: yes, but who runs them and
how do they work? What will be your job when
things break? Will your present interests fit into a
military organization?
You may have voted for Willkie at the last elec
tion because you thought F.D.R. was slightly off the
track. But that's past now and can't be changed; yet,
your present status of. "Oh, what the hell—forget it."
can be and should bo changed.
Take it away, E.G.E. I'm all for you.
A Reservist
