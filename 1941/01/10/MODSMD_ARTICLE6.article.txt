# Belgian Bells Arrive Via New York World's Fair
## 
### 
From Tournai, Belgium, to the belfry of the Hoover War Library.
That's the story—not quite completed—of the famous Belgian carillon
which arrived on campus two days ago, after a delayed voyage half-way
around the world by land and sea.
The 35 bells and playing mechanism, weighing 20,000 pounds, were

manufactured in Toumai,
by Marcel Michels, one of the
world's greatest craftsmen in his
field. On each large bell is cast the
inscription, "Me fudit Tornaci Mar
cellus Michels Jr.—1939."
When completed, the carillon was
shipped across the Atlantic to New
York, where for the last two years
its music has entertained New York
Fair-goers from the tower of the
Belgian Pavilion. The carillon, with
a three-ton statue of the late King
Albert I of Belgium, was trans
ported from New York to San Fran
cisco by boat and was immediately
brought to Stanford by a two-trailer
truck, manned by a special crew.
Installation will begin the middle
of February when Kamiel Lefevre,
carillonneur of the Riverside Church
in New York City, arrives to super
vise the difficult task. Installation
will take about a month.
The bells and equipment will as
cend the new library building in
the elevator, not up the outside by
crane. They will be placed in the
belfrey, approximately 250 feet
above ground, hanging in a steel
frame. The frame will occupy a
space 20 feet square and 18 feet
high.

The keyboard, or clavier, will be
installed immediately below the bel
fry on the thirteenth floor. In addi
tion to the clavier, for manual play
ing by a carilloneur, there will be
installed an electrically driven drum
which can be used to play the bells
automatically.
The drum contains 7,400 holes in
which pegs called "notes" are in
serted. As the drum revolves, these
trip a contact which causes the ap
propriate bell to ring. Thus, 120 full
bars of music can be played auto
matically.
The largest bell weighs 1500
pounds and sounds the lowest tone
of the carillon, G-sharp. Smallest
of the bells weighs 25 pounds and
sounds G-sharp, three octaves
higher. With a range of three oc
taves, the bells are capable of play
ing any piece suitable for any car
illon.
The bells, cast in peacetime, were
presented to Herbert Hoover by the
people of Belgium, "in gratitude for
his services in Belgian relief during
the World War." Bourdon, largest
of the bells, bears the Latin inscrip
tions "Quia nominor Leopoldus Reg
ius una pro pace sono super fluctus
Atlantis," which may be translated,
"Because I am Leopold I ring only
for peace over the Atlantic."
The carillon will be dedicated next
June when, in connection with
Stanford's 50t.h anniversary, the
Hoover Library building is dedi
cated.

tion to the clavier, for manual play
ing by a carilloneur, there will be
installed an electrically driven drum
which can be used to play the bells
automatically.
The drum contains 7,400 holes in
which pegs called "notes" are in
serted. As the drum revolves, these
trip a contact which causes the ap
propriate bell to ring. Thus, 120 full
bars of music can be played auto
matically.
The largest bell weighs 1500
pounds and sounds the lowest tone
of the carillon, G-sharp. Smallest
of the bells weighs 25 pounds and
sounds G-sharp, three octaves
higher. With a range of three oc
taves, the bells are capable of play
ing any piece suitable for any car
illon.
The bells, cast in peacetime, were
presented to Herbert Hoover by the
people of Belgium, "in gratitude for
his services in Belgian relief during
the World War." Bourdon, largest
of the bells, bears the Latin inscrip
tions "Quia nominor Leopoldus Reg
ius una pro pace sono super fluctus
Atlantis," which may be translated,
"Because I am Leopold I ring only
for peace over the Atlantic."
The carillon will be dedicated next
June when, in connection with
Stanford's 50t.h anniversary, the
Hoover Library building is dedi
cated.
From Tournai, Belgium, to the belfry of the Hoover War Library.
That's the story—not quite completed—of the famous Belgian carillon
which arrived on campus two days ago, after a delayed voyage half-way
around the world by land and sea.
The 35 bells and playing mechanism, weighing 20,000 pounds, were

manufactured in Toumai,
by Marcel Michels, one of the
world's greatest craftsmen in his
field. On each large bell is cast the
inscription, "Me fudit Tornaci Mar
cellus Michels Jr.—1939."
When completed, the carillon was
shipped across the Atlantic to New
York, where for the last two years
its music has entertained New York
Fair-goers from the tower of the
Belgian Pavilion. The carillon, with
a three-ton statue of the late King
Albert I of Belgium, was trans
ported from New York to San Fran
cisco by boat and was immediately
brought to Stanford by a two-trailer
truck, manned by a special crew.
Installation will begin the middle
of February when Kamiel Lefevre,
carillonneur of the Riverside Church
in New York City, arrives to super
vise the difficult task. Installation
will take about a month.
The bells and equipment will as
cend the new library building in
the elevator, not up the outside by
crane. They will be placed in the
belfrey, approximately 250 feet
above ground, hanging in a steel
frame. The frame will occupy a
space 20 feet square and 18 feet
high.

The keyboard, or clavier, will be
installed immediately below the bel
fry on the thirteenth floor. In addi
tion to the clavier, for manual play
ing by a carilloneur, there will be
installed an electrically driven drum
which can be used to play the bells
