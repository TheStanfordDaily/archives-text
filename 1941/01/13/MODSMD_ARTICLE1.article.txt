German troops have been
poised in Rumania on the Bul
garian border for some time, there
has been little discussion of the
presence of these units by represen
tatives of the neighboring Balkan
governments.
Yesterday, dispatches came from
Moscow, Istanbul, and Sofia, each
of which touch upon this subject di
rectly and indicate officially for the
first time that these governments
are watching closely the movements
of the Germans in this region.
In a communique released by the
official Tass news agency in Mos
cow, it was claimed that Russia had
not been notified of these German
troop movements, although the Nazis
have consistently declared that their
actions in the Balkans were sanc
tioned by the Soviet government.
* ♦ *
T>EFERRING to the recent ru
mors of German troops entering
Bulgaria, the communique said:
"First, if German troops really
are present in Bulgaria and if the
further dispatch of German troops
to Bulgaria really is taking place,
then all this occurred and is oc
curring without the knowledge
and consent of the U.S.S.R., since
the German side never raised the
question of the presence or dis
patch of German troops to Bul
garia.
"Second, in particular, the Bul
garian government never ap
proached the U.S.S.R. with an in
quiry regarding the passage of
German troops to Bulgaria and
consequently could not have re
ceived any reply from the
U.S.S.R."
This bulletin is interesting, to say
the least, for it was only a few days
ago that Berlin announced the cul
mination of several sizable new
trade agreements with Russia. The
wording of the Moscow communique
indicates clearly that the U.S.S.R. is
apprehensive over the German pol
icy—a drive deeper into the Bal
kans—that the Nazis have attempted
to carry out with Russian sanction.
If there is any truth to the Russian
communique, the Germans claimed
official Russian compliance which
never existed.
In Istanbul, a high Turkish official
told the United Press correspondent
that Turkey would declare war upon
Germany should Nazi troops cross
the frontier into Bulgaria.
The same Turkish official was
quoted as saying that Turkey was
already contributing to the col
lapse of the Italian garrison in
the Docecancse Islands, Italian
possessions along the Turkish
coast, by preventing supply ships
from reaching the islands. Such
an assertion demonstrates the ex
tent to which the Turks have cast
their lot with Great Britain and
her allies.

J>REMIER Bogdan Filoff, top man
in King Boris' government in
Bulgaria, reiterated his country's
pledge to fight if necessary to de
fend its interests and freedom. He
said that the nation's prime inter
ests continued to be to stay out of
the conflict.
This statement came from the
three nations standing in the path
of any German drive to the south
east and to the oil fields of the Near
East.
The statements made in Bulgaria
and in Turkey sounded as if Rus
sian assistance would be taken for
granted in the event of further Ger
man aggression in the Balkans. The
attitude expressed in these two
countries, coupled with the official
communique released in Moscow,
may be a clue to a strengthening of
Balkan resistance.

J>REMIER Bogdan Filoff, top man
in King Boris' government in
Bulgaria, reiterated his country's
pledge to fight if necessary to de
fend its interests and freedom. He
said that the nation's prime inter
ests continued to be to stay out of
the conflict.
This statement came from the
three nations standing in the path
of any German drive to the south
east and to the oil fields of the Near
East.
The statements made in Bulgaria
and in Turkey sounded as if Rus
sian assistance would be taken for
granted in the event of further Ger
man aggression in the Balkans. The
attitude expressed in these two
countries, coupled with the official
communique released in Moscow,
may be a clue to a strengthening of
Balkan resistance.
German troops have been
poised in Rumania on the Bul
garian border for some time, there
has been little discussion of the
presence of these units by represen
tatives of the neighboring Balkan
governments.
Yesterday, dispatches came from
Moscow, Istanbul, and Sofia, each
of which touch upon this subject di
rectly and indicate officially for the
first time that these governments
are watching closely the movements
of the Germans in this region.
In a communique released by the
official Tass news agency in Mos
cow, it was claimed that Russia had
not been notified of these German
troop movements, although the Nazis
have consistently declared that their
actions in the Balkans were sanc
tioned by the Soviet government.
* ♦ *
T>EFERRING to the recent ru
mors of German troops entering
Bulgaria, the communique said:
"First, if German troops really
are present in Bulgaria and if the
further dispatch of German troops
to Bulgaria really is taking place,
then all this occurred and is oc
curring without the knowledge
and consent of the U.S.S.R., since
the German side never raised the
question of the presence or dis
patch of German troops to Bul
garia.
"Second, in particular, the Bul
garian government never ap
proached the U.S.S.R. with an in
quiry regarding the passage of
German troops to Bulgaria and
consequently could not have re
ceived any reply from the
U.S.S.R."
This bulletin is interesting, to say
the least, for it was only a few days
ago that Berlin announced the cul
mination of several sizable new
trade agreements with Russia. The
wording of the Moscow communique
indicates clearly that the U.S.S.R. is
apprehensive over the German pol
icy—a drive deeper into the Bal
kans—that the Nazis have attempted
to carry out with Russian sanction.
If there is any truth to the Russian
communique, the Germans claimed
official Russian compliance which
never existed.
In Istanbul, a high Turkish official
told the United Press correspondent
that Turkey would declare war upon
Germany should Nazi troops cross
the frontier into Bulgaria.
The same Turkish official was
quoted as saying that Turkey was
already contributing to the col
lapse of the Italian garrison in
the Docecancse Islands, Italian
possessions along the Turkish
coast, by preventing supply ships
from reaching the islands. Such
an assertion demonstrates the ex
tent to which the Turks have cast
their lot with Great Britain and
her allies.
