# Graduates Hold Key Jobs In U.S. Foreign Service

### CLAUDIA NETTLES 
(Editor's Note: This is the first of two articles dealing with Stan
ford graduates who arc members of the United States Foreign Service.
Many of these ex-Stanfordites hold positions that have become doubly
important since the outbreak of World War II.)

Stationed at vital diplomatic posts throughout the world, Stanford
graduates in the United States Foreign Service are helping to direct
American political and economic policies in today's war crisis. Since 1921
over 25 Stanford students have been placed in consular and diplomatic
offices by the government of the United States.

Last week's mails brought the po
litical science department the news
that eight more Farm students have
passed their written examinations in
Washington for entrance into the
service. Although they must still
take oral exams, Dr. Graham Stuart
feels certain that any man capable
of coming out on top in the strin
gent writtens can master the orals,
too.
SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATES
Temple Wanamaker and Ernest
Siracusa, two of the successful can
didates, were graduated from Stan
ford last spring. Both men belonged
to Phi Beta Kappa, Phi Sigma Al
pha (political science honorary fra
ternity), and International Relations
Club.
Wanamaker took all of his polit
ical science courses on independent
study. He also made all prepara
tion for the foreign exams on his
own hook. Such independent prep
aration is a rare feat since the great
majority of candidates take at least
three months of specialized training
in Washington beforehand. Siracusa
prepared at the Campbell-Turner
School last summer.
Benedict Prieth, another man who
passed the written exams, possesses
three Stanford degrees. He was
graduated here in 1931, took his
master's degree in 1932 and his doc
tor's degree in 1939. For his doc
tor's dissertation on Germany's la
bor front, Prieth conducted exten
sive investigation in Germany.

rection of the late Walter Thomp
