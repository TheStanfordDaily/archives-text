# Graduates Hold Key Jobs In U.S. Foreign Service
## 
### CLAUDIA NETTLES 
(Editor's Note: This is the first of two articles dealing with Stan
ford graduates who arc members of the United States Foreign Service.
Many of these ex-Stanfordites hold positions that have become doubly
important since the outbreak of World War II.)

Stationed at vital diplomatic posts throughout the world, Stanford
graduates in the United States Foreign Service are helping to direct
American political and economic policies in today's war crisis. Since 1921
over 25 Stanford students have been placed in consular and diplomatic
offices by the government of the United States.

Last week's mails brought the po
litical science department the news
that eight more Farm students have
passed their written examinations in
Washington for entrance into the
service. Although they must still
take oral exams, Dr. Graham Stuart
feels certain that any man capable
of coming out on top in the strin
gent writtens can master the orals,
too.
SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATES
Temple Wanamaker and Ernest
Siracusa, two of the successful can
didates, were graduated from Stan
ford last spring. Both men belonged
to Phi Beta Kappa, Phi Sigma Al
pha (political science honorary fra
ternity), and International Relations
Club.
Wanamaker took all of his polit
ical science courses on independent
study. He also made all prepara
tion for the foreign exams on his
own hook. Such independent prep
aration is a rare feat since the great
majority of candidates take at least
three months of specialized training
in Washington beforehand. Siracusa
prepared at the Campbell-Turner
School last summer.
Benedict Prieth, another man who
passed the written exams, possesses
three Stanford degrees. He was
graduated here in 1931, took his
master's degree in 1932 and his doc
tor's degree in 1939. For his doc
tor's dissertation on Germany's la
bor front, Prieth conducted exten
sive investigation in Germany.
THOMPSON DIRECTS
He wrote his thesis under the di
rection of the late Walter Thomp
son, political science professor. Be
fore coming to Stanford, Prieth at
tended Realschule in Traunstein,
Bavaria, for five years and studied J
law at the University of Munich. He
was at one time a member of the
Nazi party.
The other five men who have
completed the major requirement
for Foreign Serivce placement are
Constantine Gertmenian, James
Triola, Winchester Heicher, William
Durkee, and Oscar C. Holder.
OUTSTANDING
Outstanding among Stanford's
veteran diplomats is Dr. Frances
Willis, one of the few women ever
to he selected for this profession.
Since July, Dr. Willis has been sta
tioned at Madrid, where she holds I
a consular post. Before she was ;
moved to Madrid, Dr. Willis served
in the foreign embassies at Brus- I
sels, Valparaiso, Santiago, Stock- ;
holm, and Luxemburg. She took her
doctor's degree in the political de
partment in 1923.
ON DUTY IN SPAIN
Also on duty in Spain is John j
Jernegan, '33, vice-consul at Barce
lona. His particular duties include
issuing visas to Europeans to sail for
the United States. Since Spain and
Portugal are the only two countries
from which Europeans can still get
to the United States, the immigra
tion problem in Spanish consular
posts is acute.
Although Lisbon is the greatest
exit gateway, all seaport towns such
as Barcelona encounter vast num
ber's of war refugees. Jernegan also
aids supervision of United States
commercial activities in Spain.

Black widow spiders are so named
because the females willingly make
widows of themselves by eating iheir
husbands.

Stationed at vital diplomatic posts throughout the world, Stanford
graduates in the United States Foreign Service are helping to direct
American political and economic policies in today's war crisis. Since 1921
over 25 Stanford students have been placed in consular and diplomatic
offices by the government of the United States.

Last week's mails brought the po

that eight more Farm students have
passed their written examinations in

feels certain that any man capable
of coming out on top in the strin

SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATES
Temple Wanamaker and Ernest
Siracusa, two of the successful can
didates, were graduated from Stan
ford last spring. Both men belonged
to Phi Beta Kappa, Phi Sigma Al
pha (political science honorary fra
ternity), and International Relations
Club.
Wanamaker took all of his polit
ical science courses on independent
study. He also made all prepara
tion for the foreign exams on his
own hook. Such independent prep
aration is a rare feat since the great
majority of candidates take at least
three months of specialized training
in Washington beforehand. Siracusa
prepared at the Campbell-Turner
School last summer.
Benedict Prieth, another man who
passed the written exams, possesses
three Stanford degrees. He was
graduated here in 1931, took his
master's degree in 1932 and his doc
tor's degree in 1939. For his doc
tor's dissertation on Germany's la
bor front, Prieth conducted exten
sive investigation in Germany.
THOMPSON DIRECTS
He wrote his thesis under the di
rection of the late Walter Thomp
son, political science professor. Be
fore coming to Stanford, Prieth at
tended Realschule in Traunstein,
Bavaria, for five years and studied J
law at the University of Munich. He
was at one time a member of the
Nazi party.
The other five men who have
completed the major requirement
for Foreign Serivce placement are
Constantine Gertmenian, James
Triola, Winchester Heicher, William
Durkee, and Oscar C. Holder.

ON DUTY IN SPAIN
Also on duty in Spain is John j
Jernegan, '33, vice-consul at Barce
lona. His particular duties include
issuing visas to Europeans to sail for
the United States. Since Spain and
Portugal are the only two countries
from which Europeans can still get
to the United States, the immigra
tion problem in Spanish consular
posts is acute.
Although Lisbon is the greatest
exit gateway, all seaport towns such
as Barcelona encounter vast num
ber's of war refugees. Jernegan also
aids supervision of United States
commercial activities in Spain.

Black widow spiders are so named
because the females willingly make
widows of themselves by eating iheir
husbands.
