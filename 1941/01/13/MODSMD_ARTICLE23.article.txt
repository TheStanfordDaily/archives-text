# 'No Strike,' Says Card Track Team in Answer To Unfounded Report
## Cinder Squad to Continue Practice Despite Mistaken Rumor of Break Reported by San Francisco Paper 
### CHUCK SMITH 
If Stanford's varsity track team strikes, it will he because the idea was
put in their minds by some misinformed sports writers of a San Francisco
paper. For no such dream ever entered the minds of the Indian runners
and jumpers until they opened the sports pages <>f this paper yesterday.
True, things haven't been running as smoothly as possible out on

►Angell Field, but there is no more
, stress or strain than could be ex
pected during the first season of a
new coach with novel ideas about
j coaching track.
And yet Franklin "Pitch" John
son, Stanford's new cinder coach,
and his ideas are new only to Stan
ford. He is a coach with a fine rec
ord at Drake University behind
j him who believes in bringing a track
man gradually up to a peak, quite a
; contrast to the hard work methods
used by Dink Templeton and Bill
Ellington before him.
MISUNDERSTANDINGS ARISE
But few misunderstandings which
have arisen from Johnson's emphasis
on attendance in his track classes
and his cautious method of develop
ing a star apparently provided an
unknown sports writer on the afore
mentioned San Francisco paper with
just the scrap of material for a
sensational blast concerning an ap
proaching strike by the Stanford
tracksters.
The only important and startling
bit of truth printed in this exagger
ated picture of conditions on the
Farm was the fact that Ken Battag
lia, not Frank, as the badly con
fused author of the article insisted
on calling him, has been refused a
grant-in-aid scholarship this coming
quarter.
NO EVIDENCE PRESENT
Kenny's grant-in-aid was handled
by the Buck-of-the-Month Club,
which has been forced to drop sev
eral of their scholarships lately be
cause of lack of funds. There is no
evidence, as was revealed in a B.A.C.
meeting last night, that Kenny has
been refused financial aid because
he has not co-operated with John
son and his proposed strenuous
schedule of workouts for the com
ing quarter.
As to the inferences made by the
San Francisco writer concerning
the other leading tracksters, Al
Gray, shot putter, Sid Hayes, hurd
ler, and Jim Lincoln, high jumper,
quitting track entirely — these are
absolutely false.
NONE HAVE QUIT
According to team caplain Ernie
Clark, none of these potential point
winners in conference competition
will drop track. Hayes has signed
up for golf (his quarter but spends
more time working out on Angell
Field than he docs at the golf
course.
While Gray and Lincoln, though
they were both victims of John
son's strict grading for their poor
atendance during the fall quarter,
have no intention in the world of
failing to turn out for track and to
buckle down to hard work when
the season gets under way.

bit of truth printed in this exagger
ated picture of conditions on the
Farm was the fact that Ken Battag
lia, not Frank, as the badly con
fused author of the article insisted
on calling him, has been refused a
grant-in-aid scholarship this coming
quarter.
NO EVIDENCE PRESENT
Kenny's grant-in-aid was handled
by the Buck-of-the-Month Club,
which has been forced to drop sev
eral of their scholarships lately be
cause of lack of funds. There is no
evidence, as was revealed in a B.A.C.
meeting last night, that Kenny has
been refused financial aid because
he has not co-operated with John
son and his proposed strenuous
schedule of workouts for the com
ing quarter.
As to the inferences made by the
San Francisco writer concerning
the other leading tracksters, Al
Gray, shot putter, Sid Hayes, hurd
ler, and Jim Lincoln, high jumper,
quitting track entirely — these are
absolutely false.
NONE HAVE QUIT
According to team caplain Ernie
Clark, none of these potential point
winners in conference competition
will drop track. Hayes has signed
up for golf (his quarter but spends
more time working out on Angell
Field than he docs at the golf
course.
While Gray and Lincoln, though
they were both victims of John
son's strict grading for their poor
atendance during the fall quarter,
have no intention in the world of
failing to turn out for track and to
buckle down to hard work when
the season gets under way.
If Stanford's varsity track team strikes, it will he because the idea was
put in their minds by some misinformed sports writers of a San Francisco
paper. For no such dream ever entered the minds of the Indian runners
and jumpers until they opened the sports pages <>f this paper yesterday.
True, things haven't been running as smoothly as possible out on

►Angell Field, but there is no more
, stress or strain than could be ex
pected during the first season of a
new coach with novel ideas about
j coaching track.
And yet Franklin "Pitch" John
son, Stanford's new cinder coach,
and his ideas are new only to Stan
ford. He is a coach with a fine rec
ord at Drake University behind
j him who believes in bringing a track
man gradually up to a peak, quite a
; contrast to the hard work methods
used by Dink Templeton and Bill
Ellington before him.
MISUNDERSTANDINGS ARISE
But few misunderstandings which
have arisen from Johnson's emphasis
on attendance in his track classes
and his cautious method of develop
ing a star apparently provided an
unknown sports writer on the afore
mentioned San Francisco paper with
just the scrap of material for a
sensational blast concerning an ap
proaching strike by the Stanford
tracksters.
