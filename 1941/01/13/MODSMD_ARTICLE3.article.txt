# Fight Starts To Restrict F.R.'s Power
## Congressional Battle Looms on New 'Land, Lease' Aid for Allies 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 12 (UP).â€”A
bi-partisan drive to limit drastically
the supreme power which the "lend
lease" bill to aid embattled democ
racies would vest in President
Roosevelt gained momentum tonight
as democratic leaders prepared to
start the measure on its way through
Congress this week.
FOUR OBJECTIVES
The campaign thus far has devel
oped four objectives:
1. Reasonable security for defense
weapons obtained from this country
under the plan.
8. Limitation to one or two years
of the proposed presidential power.
4. Elimination or revision of the
provision allowing craft of foreign
powers to be repaired or outfitted
in American air, military and naval
bases.
4. Continued certification by Army
and Naval officials that this na
tion's defense would not be weak
ened by materials sent abroad.
Abandonment of such assurance is
projected in the legislation.
Leaders would not predict to what
extent the legislators would adhere
to President Roosevelt's plea for
speedy action on the bill. It was
trapped at the outset in a "prestige
battle" among House democrats.
PRESTIGE FIGHT
Chairman Andrew J. May, D., Ky.,
of the Military Affairs Committee,
will seek tomorrow to have the
measure withdrawn from the For
iegn Affairs Committee and sent to
his group. Chairman Sol Bloom, D.,
N.Y., of the Foreign Affairs group,
was not worried and prepared to
open hearings on Tuesday.
He said first witnesses will be
Secretary of State Cordell Hull,
Secretary of the Navy Frank;
Knox, Secretary of War Henry L.
Stimson, and Secretary of the Treas
ury Henry Morgenthau, Jr. He plans
to conclude hearings in three days
and rush the legislation to the
floor.
