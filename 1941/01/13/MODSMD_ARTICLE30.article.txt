WASHINGTON, Jan. 12 (UP).—
The American Federation of Labor
tonight urged Congress to approve
promptly President Roosevelt's de
fense plans but reiterated its oppo
sition to restriction of civil freedoms,
including the right to strike.
The Federation pledged its sup
port of "the Administration's total
defense program" in a 1941 legisla
tive program made public by Presi
dent Wiiliam Green. He said the
A.F.L. "does not seek selfish advan
tage for labor at the expense of
national welfare" but that, on the
contrary, it "pledges labor to make
sacrifices for the national welfare."
Its publication coincided with an
nouncement by Senator Henry Cabot
Lodge, Jr., R., Mass., that he plans
to introduce legislation "for the cre
ation of a special congressional com
mittee to look into all phases of our
national defense effort."
