HYDE PARK, N.Y., Jan. 12 (UP).
—President Roosevelt today cre
ated a Division of Defense Housing
Co-ordination in the executive de
partment to insure that expansion
of defense industries will not cause
acute housing shortages unprepared
for such an emergency.
Mr. Roosevelt created the new
agency by executive order, giving
the force of law to duties which
Palmer previously had been exe
cuting in a quasi-official capacity
under the old N.D.H.C. setup.
The housing co-ordination office
will not have funds or authority
actually to construct new dwellings.
Instead, it will act in liaison, co
ordinating work of existing housing
organizations and directing their ef
forts toward communities where
rapidly expanding defense indus
tries are creating acute problems.
