### JERRY BRUCKER 
Everett Dean's bas
keteers defeated the highly-rated
Santa Clara Broncos up at the Civic
Auditorium Saturday night, their
showing must have caused a lot of
the experts to stop and think a
little.
Before the season started most
sports writers were willing to hand
at least the Southern Division Cham
pionship of the P.C.C. to the In
dians on a silver platter, as the say
ing has gone so often.
We've got to admit being guilty
of that same frame of mind, but
the last four times we've seen the
club in action causes us to won
der if Coach Dean's crew may not
have quite a tussle to wrest the
crown from Sam Barry's Trojans.
Southern California, regarded be
fore the cage season got under way
as slightly weaker than usual,
seems to have come up with a fine
team. Their record in non-confer
ence practice games is very feood,
including, as it does, a victory over
Indiana. There are a lot of circum
stances connected with the Stanford-
Indiana and S.C. - Indiana games
that make the comparative scores
unreliable, but the fact remains that
the Trojans turned the trick ar.d the
Indians did not.
* # *
mistake that the Indians
made in the Utah State, San
Diego State, and St. Mary's games
could be somewhat overlooked. The
Farm quint was so far superior to
these teams that wild passes and
missed set-ups could be charged to
a natural relaxation against infe
rior squads.
But when you come to the
Santa Clara game, it's a different
story. Granting that the Broncs
were probably the best team, ex
cluding Indiana, that Stanford has
met this year, the Deanmcn still
looked far from impressive.
The squad was undoubtedly tied
up, as is more or less natural against
a traditional foe of this caliber, but
that factor alone cannot account for
the many fumbles, bad passes, and
missed free throws.
Of course, no basketball team can
be perfect, the best quintets can't
go through a game without a few
boots and wild passes. And with the
intricate, fast-passing style of play
Dean has installed, these errors are
bound to increase some.
* * *
there were at least a dozen
times Saturday night when the
ball was passed to a spot where no
Stanford man was, and it looked a
trifle foolish, to say the least, to see
the ball go between a couple of
Santa Clara men and out of bounds.
The most convincing evidence that
the team was off form is to be
found in the foul shooting. Co
captain Don Williams is usually
quite accurate from the free-throw
line, but against Santa Clara he
managed to cash in on only two
charity tosses out of seven.
Looking back, it would seem
that the squad has tailed off defi
nitely from the peak they reached
in the games during vacation.
Perhaps that's a natural result of
having to buckle down and put in
a little time on book larnin' now
and then.
Glancing at the other side of
things for a moment, however, the
Indians were very good when their
passes did connect Saturday night.
And Don Burness cracked out of a
mild scoring slump to tank six field
goals for 12 points. If the squad
can sharpen up a little this week
they might regain top form when
the Trojans come to town Friday
and Saturday.
* * *
JTS hard to say what this track
situation that broke in the San
Francisco papers yesterday is likely
1o take. My guess is thai*it will soon
be hushed up completely, and that
the whole affair wil blow over.
There are undoubtedly a lot of
angles to the affair that will prob
ably never come to light.
We feel a trifle peeved at the
"spokesman for the team" who
handed the story to the Chronicle
on the day that The Daily could
not get at least an even break on
the beat. The only obvious rea
son for sabotaging the campus pa
per in this fashion and giving the
exclusive story to another paper
would be the monetary considera
tion that might be involved.
Luckily, the story received fairly
friendly treatment from the Chron
icle, but the result in other papers
will probably be a good deal harsher.
Regardless of whether or not the
trackmen had sound reason to kick,
the course they took is going to lead
to very adverse publicity, possibly
of the type that followed the Cleve
land Indian blow-up last summer.

little.
Before the season started most
sports writers were willing to hand
at least the Southern Division Cham
pionship of the P.C.C. to the In
dians on a silver platter, as the say
ing has gone so often.
We've got to admit being guilty
of that same frame of mind, but
the last four times we've seen the
club in action causes us to won
der if Coach Dean's crew may not
have quite a tussle to wrest the
crown from Sam Barry's Trojans.
Southern California, regarded be
fore the cage season got under way
as slightly weaker than usual,
seems to have come up with a fine
team. Their record in non-confer
ence practice games is very feood,
including, as it does, a victory over
Indiana. There are a lot of circum
stances connected with the Stanford-
Indiana and S.C. - Indiana games
that make the comparative scores
unreliable, but the fact remains that
the Trojans turned the trick ar.d the
Indians did not.
* # *
mistake that the Indians
made in the Utah State, San
Diego State, and St. Mary's games
could be somewhat overlooked. The
Farm quint was so far superior to
these teams that wild passes and
missed set-ups could be charged to
a natural relaxation against infe
rior squads.
But when you come to the
Santa Clara game, it's a different
story. Granting that the Broncs
were probably the best team, ex
cluding Indiana, that Stanford has
met this year, the Deanmcn still
looked far from impressive.
The squad was undoubtedly tied
up, as is more or less natural against
a traditional foe of this caliber, but
that factor alone cannot account for
the many fumbles, bad passes, and
missed free throws.
Of course, no basketball team can
be perfect, the best quintets can't
go through a game without a few
boots and wild passes. And with the
intricate, fast-passing style of play
Dean has installed, these errors are
bound to increase some.
* * *
there were at least a dozen
times Saturday night when the
ball was passed to a spot where no
Stanford man was, and it looked a
trifle foolish, to say the least, to see
the ball go between a couple of
Santa Clara men and out of bounds.
The most convincing evidence that
the team was off form is to be
found in the foul shooting. Co
captain Don Williams is usually
quite accurate from the free-throw
line, but against Santa Clara he
managed to cash in on only two
charity tosses out of seven.
Looking back, it would seem
that the squad has tailed off defi
nitely from the peak they reached
in the games during vacation.
Perhaps that's a natural result of
having to buckle down and put in
a little time on book larnin' now
and then.
Glancing at the other side of
things for a moment, however, the
Indians were very good when their
passes did connect Saturday night.
And Don Burness cracked out of a
mild scoring slump to tank six field
goals for 12 points. If the squad
can sharpen up a little this week
they might regain top form when
the Trojans come to town Friday
and Saturday.

JTS hard to say what this track

1o take. My guess is thai*it will soon
be hushed up completely, and that
the whole affair wil blow over.
There are undoubtedly a lot of
angles to the affair that will prob
ably never come to light.
We feel a trifle peeved at the
"spokesman for the team" who
handed the story to the Chronicle
on the day that The Daily could
not get at least an even break on
the beat. The only obvious rea
son for sabotaging the campus pa
per in this fashion and giving the
exclusive story to another paper
would be the monetary considera

Luckily, the story received fairly
friendly treatment from the Chron
icle, but the result in other papers
will probably be a good deal harsher.
Regardless of whether or not the
trackmen had sound reason to kick,
the course they took is going to lead
to very adverse publicity, possibly
of the type that followed the Cleve

dians on a silver platter, as the say
ing has gone so often.
We've got to admit being guilty
of that same frame of mind, but
the last four times we've seen the
club in action causes us to won
der if Coach Dean's crew may not
have quite a tussle to wrest the
crown from Sam Barry's Trojans.
Southern California, regarded be
fore the cage season got under way
as slightly weaker than usual,
seems to have come up with a fine
team. Their record in non-confer
ence practice games is very feood,
including, as it does, a victory over
Indiana. There are a lot of circum
stances connected with the Stanford-
Indiana and S.C. - Indiana games
that make the comparative scores
unreliable, but the fact remains that
the Trojans turned the trick ar.d the
Indians did not.
* # *
mistake that the Indians
made in the Utah State, San
Diego State, and St. Mary's games
could be somewhat overlooked. The
Farm quint was so far superior to
these teams that wild passes and
missed set-ups could be charged to
a natural relaxation against infe
rior squads.
But when you come to the
Santa Clara game, it's a different
story. Granting that the Broncs
were probably the best team, ex
cluding Indiana, that Stanford has
met this year, the Deanmcn still
looked far from impressive.
The squad was undoubtedly tied
up, as is more or less natural against
a traditional foe of this caliber, but
that factor alone cannot account for
the many fumbles, bad passes, and
missed free throws.
Of course, no basketball team can
be perfect, the best quintets can't
go through a game without a few
boots and wild passes. And with the
intricate, fast-passing style of play
Dean has installed, these errors are
bound to increase some.
* * *
there were at least a dozen
times Saturday night when the
ball was passed to a spot where no
Stanford man was, and it looked a
trifle foolish, to say the least, to see
the ball go between a couple of
Santa Clara men and out of bounds.
The most convincing evidence that
the team was off form is to be
found in the foul shooting. Co
captain Don Williams is usually
quite accurate from the free-throw
line, but against Santa Clara he
managed to cash in on only two
charity tosses out of seven.
Looking back, it would seem
that the squad has tailed off defi
nitely from the peak they reached
in the games during vacation.
Perhaps that's a natural result of
having to buckle down and put in
a little time on book larnin' now
and then.
Glancing at the other side of
things for a moment, however, the
Indians were very good when their
passes did connect Saturday night.
And Don Burness cracked out of a
mild scoring slump to tank six field
goals for 12 points. If the squad
can sharpen up a little this week
they might regain top form when
the Trojans come to town Friday
and Saturday.

JTS hard to say what this track
situation that broke in the San
Francisco papers yesterday is likely
1o take. My guess is thai*it will soon
be hushed up completely, and that
the whole affair wil blow over.
There are undoubtedly a lot of
angles to the affair that will prob
ably never come to light.
We feel a trifle peeved at the
"spokesman for the team" who
handed the story to the Chronicle
on the day that The Daily could
not get at least an even break on
the beat. The only obvious rea
son for sabotaging the campus pa
per in this fashion and giving the
exclusive story to another paper
would be the monetary considera
tion that might be involved.
Luckily, the story received fairly
friendly treatment from the Chron
icle, but the result in other papers
will probably be a good deal harsher.
Regardless of whether or not the
trackmen had sound reason to kick,
the course they took is going to lead
to very adverse publicity, possibly
of the type that followed the Cleve
land Indian blow-up last summer.
Everett Dean's bas
keteers defeated the highly-rated
Santa Clara Broncos up at the Civic
Auditorium Saturday night, their
showing must have caused a lot of
the experts to stop and think a
little.

sports writers were willing to hand
at least the Southern Division Cham
