# Indians Corral Broncos
## Card Quintet Wins Seventh Victory, 34-32 
### BY DON SELBY 
In as thrilling a game as you'd
ever want to see, the outcome of
which was never determined until
the final gun sounded, Stanford's
cagers took Santa Clara down the
line with a 34-32 victory in San
Francisco's Civic Auditorium Satur
day night.
Although the thrill-packed game
was as close as it could possibly be,
it was far from the best game that
Everett Dean's Indians have played
this season. Time after time the ball
would go rolling out of bounds, the
result of a pass on the part of one
Indian who was anticipating a team
mate's move which never devel
oped.
POOR ON FREE SHOTS
All other things being as they
were, Stanford would have taken
the game going away had they been
able to m-ike good on a decent num
ber of the free throws that were
awarded them, for the Indians
lurned charity tosses into points only
four times in twelve attempts. The
Broncs, on the other hand, con
verted six of their eight free throws
into points.
GAME SEE-SAWS
In the first half, the score was tied
six different times, at 2-2, 4-4, 6-6,
10-10, 15-15, and 17-17. But Stan
ford's Don Williams sent his team
out in front just before the first half
ended with a 30-foot field goal from
the side, after Marty Passaglia's
free throw had upped the Bronc
total to 18.
It looked like "goodby Broncos"
at the start of the second half, when
the Indians hit for five field goals
to run their lead out to 29-20 as
Santa Clara added only a couple of
points on charity throws. First, Don
Burness, Stanford's tricky center,
faked Jim Rickert out of position and
went around him for a lay-in shot.
Then Williams added a field goal
as a result of a beautiful bit of
passing when Fordy Anderson drove
toward the basket from the left
hand side and slipped the ball to
Burness coming in from the other
side. Burness in turn flipped it out
to Williams, who was directly in
front of the bucket.
BURNESS TALLIES
Burness then rang up three more
buckets. He went around Rickert
for the first one, took a beautiful
bounce pass under the hoop from
Anderson for the second tally, and
had a clear lay-in shot for the third.
After that, however, Santa Clara
put on a scoring rally of its own,
as Bruce Hale, the Bronco's big gun
Saturday night, and Harry O'Rourke
swished the net on long shots, and
Rickert and Passaglia tallied on
set-ups. j
With five minutes left in the ball
game, Bob Feerick and Hale hit for
field goals to bring the Broncs even
with Stanford at 32 each, at which
point-total the score remained until
there were but two minutes to go.
Then the ever-faithful Bill Cowden
whipped through a free throw and
Williams added another to put the
Indians out in front by the margin
which won the game.
Burness, Williams, and Hale were
the leading scorers for the evening,
each ringing up 12 points.

line with a 34-32 victory in San

day night.
Although the thrill-packed game
was as close as it could possibly be,
it was far from the best game that
Everett Dean's Indians have played

POOR ON FREE SHOTS
All other things being as they
were, Stanford would have taken
the game going away had they been
able to m-ike good on a decent num
ber of the free throws that were
awarded them, for the Indians
lurned charity tosses into points only
four times in twelve attempts. The
Broncs, on the other hand, con

into points.
GAME SEE-SAWS
In the first half, the score was tied
six different times, at 2-2, 4-4, 6-6,
10-10, 15-15, and 17-17. But Stan
ford's Don Williams sent his team
out in front just before the first half
ended with a 30-foot field goal from
the side, after Marty Passaglia's
free throw had upped the Bronc
total to 18.
It looked like "goodby Broncos"
at the start of the second half, when
the Indians hit for five field goals
to run their lead out to 29-20 as
Santa Clara added only a couple of
points on charity throws. First, Don
Burness, Stanford's tricky center,
faked Jim Rickert out of position and
went around him for a lay-in shot.
Then Williams added a field goal
as a result of a beautiful bit of
passing when Fordy Anderson drove
toward the basket from the left
hand side and slipped the ball to
Burness coming in from the other
side. Burness in turn flipped it out
to Williams, who was directly in

Everett Dean's Indians have played
this season. Time after time the ball
would go rolling out of bounds, the
result of a pass on the part of one
Indian who was anticipating a team
mate's move which never devel
oped.
POOR ON FREE SHOTS
All other things being as they
were, Stanford would have taken
the game going away had they been
able to m-ike good on a decent num
ber of the free throws that were
awarded them, for the Indians
lurned charity tosses into points only
four times in twelve attempts. The
Broncs, on the other hand, con
verted six of their eight free throws
into points.
GAME SEE-SAWS
In the first half, the score was tied
six different times, at 2-2, 4-4, 6-6,
10-10, 15-15, and 17-17. But Stan
ford's Don Williams sent his team
out in front just before the first half
ended with a 30-foot field goal from
the side, after Marty Passaglia's
free throw had upped the Bronc
total to 18.
It looked like "goodby Broncos"
at the start of the second half, when
the Indians hit for five field goals
to run their lead out to 29-20 as
Santa Clara added only a couple of
points on charity throws. First, Don
Burness, Stanford's tricky center,
faked Jim Rickert out of position and
went around him for a lay-in shot.
Then Williams added a field goal
as a result of a beautiful bit of
passing when Fordy Anderson drove
toward the basket from the left
hand side and slipped the ball to
Burness coming in from the other
side. Burness in turn flipped it out
to Williams, who was directly in
front of the bucket.
BURNESS TALLIES
Burness then rang up three more
buckets. He went around Rickert
for the first one, took a beautiful
bounce pass under the hoop from
Anderson for the second tally, and
had a clear lay-in shot for the third.
After that, however, Santa Clara
put on a scoring rally of its own,
as Bruce Hale, the Bronco's big gun
Saturday night, and Harry O'Rourke
swished the net on long shots, and
Rickert and Passaglia tallied on
set-ups. j
With five minutes left in the ball
game, Bob Feerick and Hale hit for
field goals to bring the Broncs even
with Stanford at 32 each, at which
point-total the score remained until
there were but two minutes to go.
Then the ever-faithful Bill Cowden
whipped through a free throw and
Williams added another to put the
Indians out in front by the margin
which won the game.
Burness, Williams, and Hale were
the leading scorers for the evening,
each ringing up 12 points.

In as thrilling a game as you'd
ever want to see, the outcome of
which was never determined until
the final gun sounded, Stanford's
cagers took Santa Clara down the
line with a 34-32 victory in San
Francisco's Civic Auditorium Satur
