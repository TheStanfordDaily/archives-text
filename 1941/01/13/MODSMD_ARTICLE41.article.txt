# Freshman Hoopsters Scuttle Commerce, Tackle Palo Alto
## 
### 
After soundly drubbing Commerce High, 45-32, Saturday eve in San
Francisco's Civic Auditorium, Stanford's frosh hoopsters engage the Palo
Alto high quintet tonight in the Pavilion at 6:30 o'clock.
Finesse and experience played a large part in the victory, Beeb Lee's
first-stringers never being headed after the opening minutes. Lee's top

five ran up a 17-5 score in the first<
12 minutes, completely outclassing
and outmaneuvering their oppo
nents.
SECOND UNIT ALLOWS SCORES
Lee took out his first squad and
inserted a complete new unit of
Leddy, Hege, Halstead, McCann, and
McDonough. Chuck Lerable, high
scoring Commerce forwaid, found
the new defense to his liking, and
bucketed three field goals and a
free throw to bring the score to
17-12. Midge Kujimoto, flashy Com
merce forward, followed with two
more, then the new defense tight
ened up and only one more Com
merce score followed in the half, that
being a charity toss by Ace Warren.
Bob Halstead countered twice for
the frosh and followed a free throw,
the half ending 22-17.
INCREASE LEAD
With the first-stringers starting
the second half, Stanford pulled
away quickly, two six-footers, Jim
Pollard and Bob Wreisner, tallying
from close in and Bill Hooper fol
lowing with a barrage of set-ups
that put the Leemen in frent 34-23.
Lerable led the bucket brigade with
16 points, Bill Hooper came second
with 14, and Pollard third with 12.
