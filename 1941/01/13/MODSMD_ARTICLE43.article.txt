# Once-Defeated Indians Meet U.S.F. Tonight
## 
### 
With only one day's rest follow
ing their torrid debacle with the
Santa Clara Broncos Saturday niglit,
the Stanford Indians go to bat again
tonight—this time against the Uni
versity of San Francisco in the
Pavilion at 8 o'clock
Rated as the top hoop team in
northern California, Stanford will
probably go into tonight's game in 1
the favorite's seat, although it is a
well known fact that a basketball
game can, and often does, go one
way or the other without the
slightest regard for the favored
team.
On the same night as the Indians
were nosing out the Broncos, 34-32,
the Dons were dropping a close one
to Cal over at Berkeley. The Bears,
still looking for that "right" combi
nation, found one second team unit
that worked together well enough to
hand the Dons a 36-32 trimming, de
spite the offensive play of Bob Bur
man, who hit the hoop for 11 points.
If the Indians can keep U.S.F. out
side the first line of defense as far
as shots are concerned, the Dons
are liable to find themselves in a
bad way; that is, unless they can
swish the net on those 35-footers
like the Broncs did.
Because the first conference games
of the season—and those against the
always tough Trojans — are set for
this week-end, Everett Daen, Stan
ford's wily basketball mentor, is se
riously considering letting first
stringers Don Williams, Don Bur
ness, and Ken Davidson ride the
bench tonight in order that they
might get a little rest.
The other first team members,
Fordy Anderson and Bill Cowden,
are scheduled to start against the
Dons, but the chances are they
won't play long, for they, too, need
rest to be in the best of condition
for the U.S.C. invasion of the Farm.
Last season Stanford drubbed
U.S.F., 48-23, and this season both
teams are improved, which makes it
appear that the Indians should come
out on top again tonight.
The possible starting line-up:
Stanford U.S.F.
Anderson F Nessier
Penn F Bussenius
Taylor C Burnian
Wenzel G M. Porter
Cowden G J. Porter

It costs, the average angler from
$3 to $5 per pound for his fish while
the housewife gets hers in the mar
ket for 15 to 20 cents a pound.

Fordy Anderson and Bill Cowden,
are scheduled to start against the
Dons, but the chances are they
won't play long, for they, too, need
rest to be in the best of condition
for the U.S.C. invasion of the Farm.
Last season Stanford drubbed
U.S.F., 48-23, and this season both
teams are improved, which makes it
appear that the Indians should come
out on top again tonight.
The possible starting line-up:
Stanford U.S.F.
Anderson F Nessier
Penn F Bussenius
Taylor C Burnian
Wenzel G M. Porter
Cowden G J. Porter

It costs, the average angler from
$3 to $5 per pound for his fish while
the housewife gets hers in the mar
ket for 15 to 20 cents a pound.
With only one day's rest follow
ing their torrid debacle with the
Santa Clara Broncos Saturday niglit,
the Stanford Indians go to bat again
tonight—this time against the Uni
versity of San Francisco in the
Pavilion at 8 o'clock
Rated as the top hoop team in
northern California, Stanford will
probably go into tonight's game in 1
the favorite's seat, although it is a
well known fact that a basketball
game can, and often does, go one
way or the other without the
slightest regard for the favored
team.
On the same night as the Indians
were nosing out the Broncos, 34-32,
the Dons were dropping a close one
to Cal over at Berkeley. The Bears,
still looking for that "right" combi
nation, found one second team unit
that worked together well enough to
hand the Dons a 36-32 trimming, de
spite the offensive play of Bob Bur
man, who hit the hoop for 11 points.
If the Indians can keep U.S.F. out
side the first line of defense as far
as shots are concerned, the Dons
are liable to find themselves in a
bad way; that is, unless they can
swish the net on those 35-footers
like the Broncs did.
Because the first conference games
of the season—and those against the
always tough Trojans — are set for
this week-end, Everett Daen, Stan
ford's wily basketball mentor, is se
riously considering letting first
stringers Don Williams, Don Bur
ness, and Ken Davidson ride the
bench tonight in order that they
might get a little rest.
