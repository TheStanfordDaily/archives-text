# A 						Fair Chance

IN the words of a San Francisco headline, a
strike has been "averted" at Stanford.
It has been averted because it was never
contemplated. As a Daily sports writer points
out on today's front page, Stanford's track team
may suffer from dissension. But in general this
disharmony is the natural, though unfortunate,
aftermath of the Farm's unsettled coaching situ
ation last year.
Though it is certain that there are obvious
factions in the 1941 squad, their basis seems
to be coaching methods and not strictly per
sonalities. It is understandably difficult for
men who have trained along certain lines to
alter their technique.
In addition it is logical to believe that Mr.
Johnson may be unfamiliar with certain under
stood practices that have arisen at Angell Field.
Whatever arguments may be bandied about,
these facts are clear:
"Pitch" Johnson comes to the Farm with an
excellent record as a competent coach. He was
signed by the University for a period of five
years. Whatever may be his methods of train
ing and squad procedure, he deserves a chance
to demonstrate their validity.
This is Mr. Johnson's first year at Stanford.
No one expects him to turn out a Conference
championship track team. No one expects him
to be a modern miracle-man. But it is only fair
that, during this first and difficult season, he
have the full support and active collaboration
of his team and the student body.
