# Moral Retrogression
## 
### 
WHILE Stanford University is celebrating
its fiftieth birthday this year, another anni
versary that is receiving much less publicity is
also going on in an undemonstrative way on
the Farm campus.
This year marks the nineteenth that Stanford
has had its famous Honor Code, an institution
that seems unbelievable to students in a tre
mendous percentage of the nation's universi
ties, where the thought of unproctored exami
nations is inconceivable.
The University of California, one of the lead
ing educational institutions in the country, has
proctors pacing the confines of its library at all
times. It is their duty to keep absolute silence.
When Berkeleyites take their examinations it is
out of the question to expect the professor to
leave the room.
This creates a situation that is somewhat
similar to the Prohibition Era of this country
when Americans would drink because it was
the smart thing to do. At California, the stu
dents cheat in their exams merely out of resent
ment at what they consider a reflection upon
their personal integrity.
At Stanford, where students are unregulated
in their quizzes by any other medium than the
Honor Code, only an infinitesimal amount of
cribbing goes on. In fact, the Honor Code is so
strongly engrained here that a visiting professor
was booed because on leaving the room he
reminded the students to observe the Code.
But as great an institution as the Honor Code
is, of recent years it has been used as a petty
regulative whip by little brass hats on high
stools. The Honor Code in its entirety loses its
real meaning when it is applied to freshman
raids on the Big "C," to students selling their
student body cards to friends for football games,
to girls not turning in their slips when they
are on Rest Schedule, or to keeping a book out
of the library a little too long.
A student may believe that he has every right
to sell his student bdy card because he has
paid for its use and he sees no reason why
someone else should not use it if he doesn't.
When confronted with the proposition that he
has violated the Honor Code by something he
considers morally right, it is more than likely
to obscure the meaning of the Honor Code in
its greater sense. He is likely to consider it
not as a code of ethical behavior, but an instru
ment to restrict his personal rights.
The Honor Code is a fine thing, when applied
in a moral sense.
Stanfordites know innately that cheating in

exams is a serious ethical and moral breach.
They know that they will be despised by their
fellow students if they violate it. In respect to
examinations it is a vague, yet omnipotent, re
striction that keeps them in line more than any
number of proctors would.
But when it is applied to various petty things,
the Code itself becomes petty in the eyes of
the students. It loses all its moral force when
it is used as an instrument of regulation by
librarians, custodians, and nurses.
After all, traffic violators do not receive the
same punishment as murderers. Nor should
Stanford's Honor Code be held over Stanford
students for every offense.
It is too admirable a thing to be used in any
thing except its larger, greater sense.—G. M.

was booed because on leaving the room he
reminded the students to observe the Code.
But as great an institution as the Honor Code
is, of recent years it has been used as a petty
regulative whip by little brass hats on high
stools. The Honor Code in its entirety loses its
real meaning when it is applied to freshman
raids on the Big "C," to students selling their
student body cards to friends for football games,
to girls not turning in their slips when they
are on Rest Schedule, or to keeping a book out
of the library a little too long.
A student may believe that he has every right
to sell his student bdy card because he has
paid for its use and he sees no reason why
someone else should not use it if he doesn't.
When confronted with the proposition that he
has violated the Honor Code by something he
considers morally right, it is more than likely
to obscure the meaning of the Honor Code in
its greater sense. He is likely to consider it
not as a code of ethical behavior, but an instru
ment to restrict his personal rights.
The Honor Code is a fine thing, when applied
in a moral sense.
Stanfordites know innately that cheating in

exams is a serious ethical and moral breach.
They know that they will be despised by their
fellow students if they violate it. In respect to
examinations it is a vague, yet omnipotent, re
striction that keeps them in line more than any
number of proctors would.
But when it is applied to various petty things,
the Code itself becomes petty in the eyes of
the students. It loses all its moral force when
it is used as an instrument of regulation by
librarians, custodians, and nurses.
After all, traffic violators do not receive the
same punishment as murderers. Nor should
Stanford's Honor Code be held over Stanford
students for every offense.
It is too admirable a thing to be used in any
thing except its larger, greater sense.—G. M.
WHILE Stanford University is celebrating
its fiftieth birthday this year, another anni
versary that is receiving much less publicity is
also going on in an undemonstrative way on
the Farm campus.
This year marks the nineteenth that Stanford
has had its famous Honor Code, an institution
that seems unbelievable to students in a tre
mendous percentage of the nation's universi
ties, where the thought of unproctored exami
nations is inconceivable.
The University of California, one of the lead
ing educational institutions in the country, has
proctors pacing the confines of its library at all
times. It is their duty to keep absolute silence.
When Berkeleyites take their examinations it is
out of the question to expect the professor to
leave the room.
This creates a situation that is somewhat
similar to the Prohibition Era of this country
when Americans would drink because it was
the smart thing to do. At California, the stu
dents cheat in their exams merely out of resent
ment at what they consider a reflection upon
their personal integrity.
At Stanford, where students are unregulated
in their quizzes by any other medium than the
Honor Code, only an infinitesimal amount of
cribbing goes on. In fact, the Honor Code is so
strongly engrained here that a visiting professor
was booed because on leaving the room he
reminded the students to observe the Code.
