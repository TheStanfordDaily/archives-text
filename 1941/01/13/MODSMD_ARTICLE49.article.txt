### BUD AMES 
HEADS, YOU LOSE; TAILS, YOU LOSE

WTHERE do you begin the discussion of rushing?
Do you open up with some uproariously funny,
and probably extremely trite, statement about Roble
hysteria? Or, how about saying something poignant
about the "swell" (it's always "swell") job of Inter
fraternity Council? Or better yet, how about a huge
helping of rushing heartbreak?
Well, there just isn't any beginning to a discussion
of rushing down on the Farm. It's like a game of
drop-the-handkerchief. You can jump into the circle
anywhere—and it's still the same old vicious circle.
Perhaps you don't play "drop-the-hanky." But
you'll play this game. Whether you like it or not,
whether you take a direct interest in it or not, old
king rushing has got you right by the throat. You'll
play this game all right, play it until the last tear is
shed, until the last hand is shook, until the last glass
is empty, until the last pledge is straight-jacketed at
the end of this week.
* * * *
here goes for a jump into the circle. And here
you are, plumb in the middle of a roundtable on
the new things that have been going on in women's
rushing.
Yesterday Afternoon, a group of men and women,
both hall and row, bulled over the new "Run-'em-till
they-drop" system through which the Roble belles are
now catapulting faster than quicksilver through the
lady who was born with no stomach.
A Roble sponsor spoke up.
"Well, this new rushing system, with no "day of
silence," has its good and bad points," she said. "I've
got to admit that the extra day does give the girls a
better chance to see more of the houses in general
and more of "the" house in particular. And I admit
that, psychologically, the "day of silence"—just sitting
in your room, thinking—is enough to drive anyone to
Dinah's."
But, this sponsor went on to say, she believes that
from a physical standpoint the new system, which
allows no time for air, is running the girls' legs down
to the stumps.
"And besides," she added, "it doesn't allow the girls
who must make a decision to make that decision after
cool and logical thought.
"That's just the idea," one of the fellows added.
"Never let a Roble woman have time to think a
thing out."
* * * *
gVERYBODY chuckled, smiled—and their eyes took
on a far-distant look.
But really, this business of leaping before looking
logically is worth consideration. Just like they say
in all the rushing talks, after all, the girl is making
the decision of whom she will live with for the next
three years. And yet she must decide that in a mat
ter of minutes.
Last Saturday night, the second bids were distrib
uted through Roble during dinner time.
By 10:30 all those bids had to be back with pref
erences marked.
Our sponsor friend mentioned one girl who, in des
peration, flipped a coin.
That's the idea—never let a Roble woman have
time to think a thing out.

That's the idea—never let a Roble woman have
time to think a thing out.
HEADS, YOU LOSE; TAILS, YOU LOSE

WTHERE do you begin the discussion of rushing?
Do you open up with some uproariously funny,
and probably extremely trite, statement about Roble
hysteria? Or, how about saying something poignant
about the "swell" (it's always "swell") job of Inter
fraternity Council? Or better yet, how about a huge
helping of rushing heartbreak?
Well, there just isn't any beginning to a discussion
of rushing down on the Farm. It's like a game of
drop-the-handkerchief. You can jump into the circle
anywhere—and it's still the same old vicious circle.
Perhaps you don't play "drop-the-hanky." But
you'll play this game. Whether you like it or not,
whether you take a direct interest in it or not, old
king rushing has got you right by the throat. You'll
play this game all right, play it until the last tear is
shed, until the last hand is shook, until the last glass
is empty, until the last pledge is straight-jacketed at
the end of this week.

here goes for a jump into the circle. And here
you are, plumb in the middle of a roundtable on
the new things that have been going on in women's
rushing.
Yesterday Afternoon, a group of men and women,
both hall and row, bulled over the new "Run-'em-till
they-drop" system through which the Roble belles are
now catapulting faster than quicksilver through the
lady who was born with no stomach.
A Roble sponsor spoke up.
"Well, this new rushing system, with no "day of
silence," has its good and bad points," she said. "I've
got to admit that the extra day does give the girls a
better chance to see more of the houses in general
and more of "the" house in particular. And I admit
that, psychologically, the "day of silence"—just sitting
in your room, thinking—is enough to drive anyone to
Dinah's."
But, this sponsor went on to say, she believes that
from a physical standpoint the new system, which
allows no time for air, is running the girls' legs down
to the stumps.
"And besides," she added, "it doesn't allow the girls
who must make a decision to make that decision after
cool and logical thought.
"That's just the idea," one of the fellows added.
"Never let a Roble woman have time to think a
thing out."
* * * *
gVERYBODY chuckled, smiled—and their eyes took
on a far-distant look.
But really, this business of leaping before looking
logically is worth consideration. Just like they say
in all the rushing talks, after all, the girl is making
the decision of whom she will live with for the next
three years. And yet she must decide that in a mat
ter of minutes.
Last Saturday night, the second bids were distrib
uted through Roble during dinner time.
By 10:30 all those bids had to be back with pref
erences marked.
Our sponsor friend mentioned one girl who, in des
peration, flipped a coin.
That's the idea—never let a Roble woman have
time to think a thing out.
