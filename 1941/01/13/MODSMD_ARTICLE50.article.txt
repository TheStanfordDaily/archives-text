'JUIE EDITOR, SIR:
You are indeed fortunate in having Bruce Jcs
sup as the president of your student body.
At the annual Christmas Congress of N.S.F.A. in
New Brunswick, N.J., he impressed all the delegates
as the type of fellow this country needs more of!
Congratulations on your Rose Bowl victory.
Jack McKay,
Colgate University, Hamilton, N.Y.
