# NO ROBBERY HERE

r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
Many thanks to Bud Ames for his well-informed
comment on the Bookstore.
He is quite right also in his criticism of the direc
tors of the store for failing to discover some effective
means of properly informing the student body as to
the policies of the store. Those of us who are mem
bers of the board of directors have been quite con
scious of our errors of omission in this regard, and
have lately been discussing ways and means of meet
ing the problem. I hope that we can do something
about it.
Many members of the student body are actually un
aware that the Bookstore is a co-operative, non-profit
institution. (The stockholder to whom Mr. Ames re
fers never receives any dividends.)
Many students do not realize, also, that in the
past five years the Bookstore has contributed $28,000
to the University: $22,000 for the Commission for Stu
dent Aid, $2,500 for scholarships, and $3,500 for a
Bookstore Loan Fund. Last year, in addition to con
tributing $3,500 to the University, we returned to the
pre-depression practice of paying rebates to students
in proportion to their sales slips, and in the spring
quarter we thus returned about $4,171 of profits to stu
dents and faculty. We hope to cut a still fatter melon
this year.
But just a word about this robbery business. Last
year the Bookstore's profit on nearly $166,000 of sales
was $9,246, or about 5*2 per cent of gross sales. That
is about as narrow a margin as it is safe to have. In
the textbook department, about which the most grip
ing occurs, we did $73,432 worth of business for a
pretty shaky profit of $1,860 (before rebates, gift to the
University, or income taxes were deducted), or about
2 per cent of gross sales. That IS a slim margin.
In case your readers do not know who they are,
the present board of directors is made up of Dean
Jackson, Professors Dodds, Faville, Rathbun, and my
self. In addition President Jessup of the Associated
Students and Mr. Stepp, student manager, attend our
meetings and give us all the help they can. We are
all anxious to have the Bookstore serve the interests
of the student body and faculty to the 'fullest possible
extent. And believe it or not, we welcome complaints
and suggestions.

the policies of the store. Those of us who are mem
bers of the board of directors have been quite con
scious of our errors of omission in this regard, and
have lately been discussing ways and means of meet
ing the problem. I hope that we can do something
about it.
Many members of the student body are actually un
aware that the Bookstore is a co-operative, non-profit
institution. (The stockholder to whom Mr. Ames re
fers never receives any dividends.)
Many students do not realize, also, that in the
past five years the Bookstore has contributed $28,000
to the University: $22,000 for the Commission for Stu
dent Aid, $2,500 for scholarships, and $3,500 for a
Bookstore Loan Fund. Last year, in addition to con
tributing $3,500 to the University, we returned to the
pre-depression practice of paying rebates to students
in proportion to their sales slips, and in the spring
quarter we thus returned about $4,171 of profits to stu
dents and faculty. We hope to cut a still fatter melon
this year.
But just a word about this robbery business. Last
year the Bookstore's profit on nearly $166,000 of sales
was $9,246, or about 5*2 per cent of gross sales. That
is about as narrow a margin as it is safe to have. In
the textbook department, about which the most grip
ing occurs, we did $73,432 worth of business for a
pretty shaky profit of $1,860 (before rebates, gift to the
University, or income taxes were deducted), or about
2 per cent of gross sales. That IS a slim margin.
In case your readers do not know who they are,
the present board of directors is made up of Dean
Jackson, Professors Dodds, Faville, Rathbun, and my
self. In addition President Jessup of the Associated
Students and Mr. Stepp, student manager, attend our
meetings and give us all the help they can. We are
all anxious to have the Bookstore serve the interests
of the student body and faculty to the 'fullest possible
extent. And believe it or not, we welcome complaints
and suggestions.
