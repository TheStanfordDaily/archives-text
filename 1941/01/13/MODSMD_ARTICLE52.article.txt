# Feudin' Benny, Allen Rampage Through Film
## 
### 
"Love Thy Neighbor." starring Jack
Benny and Fred Allen, now show
ing at the Stanford Theater.
Risking the possibility of an anti
climactic effect, Paramount has taken
the famous radio feud of funnymen
Fred Allen and Jack Benny and
turned it into one of the hit film
comedies of the season in "Love Thy
Neighbor."
Supported by an excellent cast,
outstanding in which are Rochester,
Benny's famous butler, and Mary
Martin, who finally sings "My Heart
Belongs to Daddy" for her screen
audiences, Messrs. Benny and Allen
stage a running dog-fight.
ACTS STAND OUT
It all starts out with Allen shov
ing Jack's ramshackle "car" through
a couple of buildings and ends up
with Benny marrying Fred's niece.
The plot is the usual sequence of
absurd-situation and mistaken-iden
tity scenes, which are used only as
fill-in between the acts of Benny,
Allen, Rochester, Martin & Co. Sev
eral good songs are also introduced,
although their chance for fame has
been cut short by the radio vs.
ASCAP feud.
HERO CRACKSTERS
The heroes of "Love Thy Neigh
bor," however, are not Jack Benny
or Fred Allen, but are the gag
writers who cooked up the verbal
ammunition which the two use in
their skirmishes. Every time the
two get on the screen together they
start rattling off cracks like angry
machine-guns, and the result is
highly entertaining.
Also showing is "Murder over
New York," the latest Charlie Chan
thriller.—Minahan
