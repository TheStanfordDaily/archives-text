## 
### 
Glory and cash were heaped on
the heads of Betty Avery and Bill
Turner yesterday afternoon when
they proved the winning combina
tion on Professor Puzzlewit's week
ly radio quiz program.
Quoth the "Professor" at the end
of the program when it was an
nounced that the winners had rolled
up a score of 575, "You are to be
congratulated. These are the high
est scores we have had in many,
many moons." The victors l-eturned
triumphant and twenty-five dollars
richer last night.
Trailing with 550 were Ned Pugh
and Annabelle Clark who came out
second in the verbal tilt and were
awarded ten dollars. Short on glory,
but long on shoes, were Ross An
derson and Sylvia Berry who were
awarded money orders by the chain
shoe store sponsor for their third
place, with a score of 450.
