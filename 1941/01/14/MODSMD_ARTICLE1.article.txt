JpOR centuries the Balkan penin
sula has been a hodge-podge of
nationalities, each with its own pe
culiar nationalistic aim. For years
each of these nationalities has ex
isted as a minority group in a greater
empire of another nation. The Rus
sians, the Turks, and the Austro-
Hungarian government of pre-
World War I have controlled various
regions and peoples of the Balkan
peninsula.
Following the first World War,
some attempt was made to give each
of these peoples its own national
boundaries and government. But .
invariably, each of the peoples re
tained nationalistic aims — aims to j
recover territory which they be
lie /ec 1 belonged to them.
At the present time when so much
speculation has been heard over
possibility of extension of the war
deeper into the Balkans, it is pos
sible that the nationalistic aims of
the various peoples will play an im
portant part in determining the
course of action of each of these
governments.

IRUMANIA, if one is to go by the
claims of neighboring Balkan
states, was the winner by the treaties
following the first World War. And
Rumania has already paid for sid
ing with the Allies in the early
struggle in being forced to cede ter
ritory to all of her neighbors since
the Nazi occupation.
Bulgaria, on the other hand, is
still supposedly sitting on the
fence, between the Axis and the
British camps, waiting to see on
which side she will have the best
chance of fulfilling her national
aims. Bulgaria still insists that
Greece and Jugoslavia, and Turk
ey to a lesser extent, possess ter
ritory which by right belongs to
her.
Greece and Turkey are both al
lied with Great Britain at the pres
ent, although Turkey has not yet
actively participated in the war. If
and when the British should win this
war, it will not be likely that she
will sanction a cession of Greek or
Turkish territory to satisfy the na
tional aims of Bulgaria.
If Bulgaria's national aims play
the great part that many experts
on the Balkans believe they do,
then Bulgaria must he considered
as leaning toward the Axis. Ger
many can make her territorial
promises.
Rumors that Germany would come
to the aid of Italy by striking at
Greece through either Bulgaria or
Jugoslavia have been prevalent for
many months. Most of the talk has
concerned the possibility of German
troops attacking Greece through
Bulgaria.

B UT the shortest and quickest j
route to Greece for German
troops concentrated in Rumania and
Hungary is through Yugoslavia. And
invasion of Yugoslavia possibly
would not bring a declaration of
war by Turkey, as an invasion of
Bulgaria would be sure to, at least
according to statements made by
high Turkish officials.
Invasion of Yugoslavia might be a
much easier military operation than
generally supposed here, for the
people, and one may suppose the
army as well, of the' country are
not unified to any degree. In fact,
the Croats and the Serbs have been
at odds almost continually since the
formation of Yugoslavia following
World War I.
German government quarters have
publicized conversations carried on
with Balkan representatives lately,
but, and perhaps significantly, little
has been said concerning relations
with Yugoslavia.
Both Bulgaria and Turkey might
watch an invasion of Yugoslavia
without taking up arms themselves.
Bulgaria, for remaining passive,
might be guaranteed by the Nazis
the Yugoslav territories she consid
ers a part of her national aim.
Turkey, too, might remain passive,
for German troops in Yugoslavia
would not be a greater immediate
threat to Turkish interests than if
they remained in Rumania.

JpOR centuries the Balkan penin
sula has been a hodge-podge of
nationalities, each with its own pe
culiar nationalistic aim. For years
each of these nationalities has ex
isted as a minority group in a greater
empire of another nation. The Rus
sians, the Turks, and the Austro-
Hungarian government of pre-
World War I have controlled various
regions and peoples of the Balkan
peninsula.
Following the first World War,
some attempt was made to give each
of these peoples its own national
boundaries and government. But .
invariably, each of the peoples re
tained nationalistic aims — aims to j
recover territory which they be
lie /ec 1 belonged to them.
At the present time when so much
speculation has been heard over
possibility of extension of the war
deeper into the Balkans, it is pos
sible that the nationalistic aims of
the various peoples will play an im
portant part in determining the
course of action of each of these
governments.

IRUMANIA, if one is to go by the
claims of neighboring Balkan
states, was the winner by the treaties
following the first World War. And
Rumania has already paid for sid
ing with the Allies in the early
struggle in being forced to cede ter
ritory to all of her neighbors since
the Nazi occupation.
Bulgaria, on the other hand, is
still supposedly sitting on the
fence, between the Axis and the
British camps, waiting to see on
which side she will have the best
chance of fulfilling her national
aims. Bulgaria still insists that
Greece and Jugoslavia, and Turk
ey to a lesser extent, possess ter
ritory which by right belongs to
her.
Greece and Turkey are both al
lied with Great Britain at the pres
ent, although Turkey has not yet
actively participated in the war. If
and when the British should win this
war, it will not be likely that she
will sanction a cession of Greek or
Turkish territory to satisfy the na
tional aims of Bulgaria.
If Bulgaria's national aims play
the great part that many experts
on the Balkans believe they do,
then Bulgaria must he considered
as leaning toward the Axis. Ger
many can make her territorial
promises.
Rumors that Germany would come
to the aid of Italy by striking at
Greece through either Bulgaria or
Jugoslavia have been prevalent for
many months. Most of the talk has
concerned the possibility of German
troops attacking Greece through
Bulgaria.

B UT the shortest and quickest j
route to Greece for German
troops concentrated in Rumania and
Hungary is through Yugoslavia. And
invasion of Yugoslavia possibly
would not bring a declaration of
war by Turkey, as an invasion of
Bulgaria would be sure to, at least
according to statements made by
high Turkish officials.
Invasion of Yugoslavia might be a
much easier military operation than
generally supposed here, for the
people, and one may suppose the
army as well, of the' country are
not unified to any degree. In fact,
the Croats and the Serbs have been
at odds almost continually since the
formation of Yugoslavia following
World War I.
German government quarters have
publicized conversations carried on
with Balkan representatives lately,
but, and perhaps significantly, little
has been said concerning relations
with Yugoslavia.
Both Bulgaria and Turkey might
watch an invasion of Yugoslavia
without taking up arms themselves.
Bulgaria, for remaining passive,
might be guaranteed by the Nazis
the Yugoslav territories she consid
ers a part of her national aim.
Turkey, too, might remain passive,
for German troops in Yugoslavia
would not be a greater immediate
threat to Turkish interests than if
they remained in Rumania.
