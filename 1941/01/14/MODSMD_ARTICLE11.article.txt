pective members today and to
morrow from 11:30 to 1 o'clock for
lunch and from 5:30 to 7 o'clock for
dinner. These affairs will be the
last chances for rushees to make
their choices, and for the houses to
scrutinize prospects.
FINAL CHOICE'
Rushees will signify their final
choice by accepting invitations to
Thursday night's preference dinner.
Pledging Friday will definitely
not take place in Encina as it has
in the past, but will be done either
in the A.S.S.U. committee room in
the Old Union or in the Women's
Clubhouse, according to Pete Whit
tlesey, Interfraternity president.
FORMAL PLEDGING
Warren Turner, Interfraternity
auditor, will formally pledge the En
cinamen from 3 to 5 o'clock. Rush
ees will name the house of their
choice, and in the event there is no
bid entered for them, they may
name others.
Each house will be required, as is
customary, to buy a bid to the prom
for each active member and each
pledge. Bids will be sold at the
A.S.S.U. office at $1.25 each for the
semi-formal affair.
The dance will last from 9 to 1
o'clock in the Women's Gym, both
sides of which will be used, with
an orchestra in each.
