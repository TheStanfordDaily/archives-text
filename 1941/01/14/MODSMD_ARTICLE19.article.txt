# Ellington Expresses Surprise, 'I Never Even Suspected It'
## 
### 
Exclusive Interview with The Daily
By BUD AMES
Angcll Field is silent. No more will it hear the joshing voice of Bill
Ellington, "the grand old man of Stanford track," urging "his hoys" to
world's records.
For yesterday noon Bill Ellington, coach of last year's record-breaking
squad, was informed by representatives of Stanford's Board of Athletic-

► Control that his contract would not
be renewed next August 31, when
it terminates.
"I never knew—never even sus
pected—it was coming," Bill said
late last night in an exclusive inter
view with The Daily. He drew on
his pipe. "Then at noon I was told
that my contract would definitely
not be renewed. I was offered the
alternative of continuing in my pres
ent capacity throughout this season
or of taking a leave of absence."
REASON FOR ACTION
"The reason for this action —they
said that it was because they be
lieved 'in the future I would not
co-operate with the new coach,
Pitch Johnson'."
Ellington, absent from track cir
cles, will continue, however, to coach
golf until June. From there, Bill
has no idea where he will go. But
he will go.
"I can't tell you how tough it's
going to be to leave Stanford. I
love the place. I ought to after living
here for 14 years. No, I don't know
where I'll go."

When questioned about the offers
of coaching positions he had re
ceived from Washington State and
Michigan State, Bill stated that there
was little behind the Michigan State
offer and that the Washington State
offer entailed to much work. There
he would have been required to
coach freshman football, scout var
sity football, coach freshman bas
ketball, coach track, and teach two
classes as well.
DIVISION OF VOTES UNKNOWN
At deadline last night, Ellington
had no idea how the nine B.A.C.
votes which decided his fate were
balloted; but he expressed much in
terest.
Ellington joshed, but remained si
lent when questioned on the relation
of his discharge to recent reper
cussions in the track team.
"Well, so long, fellows," he said
through the pipe smoke. He stepped
out into the rain, heading for his
little cottage on Alvarado Row. "I'll
be seeing you around—until June."
