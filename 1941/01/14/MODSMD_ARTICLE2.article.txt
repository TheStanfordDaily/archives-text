Princess Stefanie Ilohenlohe, friend and confidante of Adolf Hitler and

apartment house last night after U.S. immigration officials had served a
warrant for her to appear in San Francisco for deportation trial Jan. 17.

Following v/eeks of rumors as
the whereabouts of the Hungarian
noblewoman, the immigration de
partment yesterday took action which
charged her with overstaying a de
partment of justice order demanding
she leave the United States by
Jan. 11.
Stephen White, a San Francisco
attorney, posted a $25,000 indemnity
bond to insure the princess' avail
ability.
Although the princess would not
admit reporters to the apartment at
602 Forest Street at which she is
staying, it was learned that she in
tended to remain in seclusion until
her trial in San Francisco Friday.
USES ALIAS
Joseph Bullock, attorney for the
princess, stated that she would have
been removed to a federal hospital
had her condition not been so
critical.

Palo Alto apartment listed under the
name of "M. J. Hunter" since Dec.
26, Bullock said.
Early in the day, the princess re
leased a statement through her at-,

is a chance to prove my innocence.
"I am anti-Nazi, pro-British and
pro-American," she said. London is
my home and England is my coun
try."
SON AT STANFORD
Her son, Francis, who attended
Stanford last year, had been in New
York but was on his way to be with
his mother, Bullock said. Francis
was a graduate student in the Divi
sion of Journalism.
Bullock asserted that the princess
"is not now and never was connected
with the Nazi government." He said
"that she had resided for a time with
Widemann, German consul general
in San Francisco, but "when she
learned the attitude of the United
States, toward her visit, she left im
mediately."
