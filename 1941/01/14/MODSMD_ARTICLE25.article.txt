# Rains Fill Lake During 10-day Farm Deluge
## 
### 
In January of 1941 the rains came
to the Farm. And the result of the
deluge is a full lake.
Not for nothing have Stanford
students been inundated for the past
10 days. For a full lake is a tacit
guarantee of a successful spring
quarter.
At present the water, which is a
dark rich brown—a healthy muddy
color—looks none too inviting. The
only things floating in it were a lost
snail ,a handful of leaves, and an
empty box which once contained
"Campfire Marshmallows."
But given a little time in which
to settle down, by spring the water
will be populated with students in
and out of boats.
The rains have not been quite as
heavy this year as last, with the re
sult that the lake, while well over
the 36-foot mark, does not seem to
be in danger of flooding. Last year
the water was over the marker ne
cessitating drainage. 4
There are still several weeks of
wet weather ahead, according to
weather predictions . The lake will
probably rise more in this time.

Torture was once recognized as a
part of criminal procedure in Scot
land.
