## Dean Yost Discusses Recent Flu Epidemic On Stanford Campus 
### 
Miss Mary Yost, dean of women,
yesterday appeared before Women's
Conference in answer to a request
for information regarding accom
modations and care of women stu
dents during the recent influenza
epidemic. Conference also elected
the members of Women's Nominat
ing Committee at this meeting.
Characterizing the flu epidemic,
which caused 71 women students to
take incompletes in all or a part of
their courses, Miss Yost gave the
statistics compiled by her office on
the effect of the flu on scholarship.
CAMPUS SUSCEPTIBLE
She also stated that even if it had
not been for the flu this fall quarter
would not have been as successful
academically as last fall. She men
tioned as a possible reason for this
the excitement and activities attend
ant the week preceding Big Game.
The figures cited by Miss Yost on
scholarship exclude incompletes
taken because of the flu. Forty-four
woman students were put on proba
tion to 44 last year. There were
eight more Lowr Division students
with grades below C than last yeai',
17 more Upper Division students
with minus 1-5, and there were 29
students to last year's 30 in Upper
Division with more than minus 5
gradepoints. To last year's six dis
qualifications, there were four this
year.
NINE SENIORS CHOSEN
Each year Conference elects nine
senior women to serve as a nomi
nating committee and to select can
didates for student body offices held
by women. For the winter elections,
this group will select candidates for
three vacant Council positions, for
the post of sophomore woman on Ex
Committee, and possibly for the post
of graduate member on Excom.
Elected yesterday were the fol
lowing members: Portia Smith, Betty
Avery, Anne Townsend, Margaret
Ray, Martha Phillips, Anne Killefer,
Nell Plopper, Martha Nordling, and
Mary Etta Farrell. These nine sen
ior women will also nominate can
didates for the spring elections.
