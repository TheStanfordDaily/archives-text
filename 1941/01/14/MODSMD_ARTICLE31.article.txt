# Marriage Complicates Farm Diplomat's Pursuit of Duty

### CLAUDIA NETTLES 
(Editor's Note: This is the sec
ond and last article dealing with
Stanford graduates who are
members of the United States
Foreign Service. Today's story
deals with incidents of the cur
rent European strife and their ef
fect on various Farm alumni ac
tive in the diplomatic service.)

One of the most ingenious devices
for solution of immigration diffi
culties in the stories of diplomatic
adventure is told by Robert M. Me-
Clintock, Stanford '31.
On duty at Santiago, Chile, Mc-
Clintock wanted to marry a Chilean
girl who was then traveling with
her mother in France. Parisian au
thorities would not grant the girl a
return passport unless she was mar
ried. So McClintock procured a
substitute bride, married her under
his true love's name, and mailed the
marriage certificate to Paris post
haste.
J'ASSED WITH HONORS
McClintock, incidentally, passed
one of the highest examinations in
the history of United States foreign
service. He is now vice-consul at
Helsinki, Sweden.
Orray Taft, '31, lost a job in the
consular service at Warsaw in the
summer of 1939, when Germany in
vaded Poland. Taft was visiting
Stanford on leave of absence before
the war broke, with the intention of
returning shortly. At that time he
told Dr. Graham Stuart, political
science professor, that he was very
pessimistic about the war threat.
Two weeks later he was notified that
the Warsaw office had been abol
ished due to the entrance of Nazi
troops. He was immediately trans
ferred to Algiers.
BLITZKRIEG WIFE
Taft's wife is classified by the for
eign service as a Blitzkrieg widow.
She was not allowed to accompany
her husband to Warsaw or Algiers.
This ban on wives extends to diplo
mats in all' belligerent countries.
The state of bachelorhood proved

a decided advantage to George
West, '33, and James Penfield, '29,
in securing appointments to the first
United States consul office in Green
land. When Germany conquered
Denmark, Greenland became a pos
sible point for German penetration.
To prevent establishment of Ger
man air bases, the United States
government immediately dispatched
consuls to Godthrabb.
ADDITIONAL QUALIFICATION
Besides the usual training, Pen
field and West could boast the
highly desirable qualification of be
ing unmarried. They started for
Greenland on less than a week's
notice.
West was graduated from Stanford
as a philosophy major. After grad
uating, he traveled in Syria, Arabia,
and Persia for the Standard Oil
Company. On this tour he decided
to enter the Foreign Service. He
returned to America, took special
training, and passed the examina
tion using his first-hand knowledge
of Arabic for the language test. West
has served at Juarez, Canton, Muk
den and Yunnanfu.
AND IN IRELAND
Vice-consul at Belfast, Ireland, is
the currently-important post held by
Roswell Beverstock, '37. He and his
colleagues keep Uncle Sam informed
on the state of English and Irish po
litical affairs.
France's collapse forced William
D. Moreland, '29, to relinquish his
job at Bordeaux for duty in the
State Department. All French con
sular posts except the one at Vichy
were closed because there was no
normal commerce or American im
migration after the German inva
sion.
