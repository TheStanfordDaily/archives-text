## JERRY BRUCKER, Sports Editor Frosh Five Easily Smites Paly, 43-22 
### 
Fourteen men saw action last night
as Stanford's frosh basket bailers ran
rings around a stubborn Palo Alto
quintet, winning their fifth victory
of the season, 43-22, in the Pavilion.
With Bill Hooper out of the line
up with a bad cold, Coach Beeb Lee
started Dick West in his place, Bob
Wreisner, Jim Pollard, Dick Middle
ton, and Frank McCann making up
the balance of the starting squad.
At the opening jump, Pollard
grabbed the leather from way up
thar', dribbled past "two slightly
nervous Palymen, and scored from
the keyhole. Pollard sank his sec
ond attempt from close in, and Mc-
Cann followed with another after
Middleton stole the ball from Jimmy
Mitchell, Palo Alto forward.
TALLIES FIVE TIMES
Before the dazed prep outfit could
tally a point, Wreisner and West
broke through and scored, leaving
the frosh with 10, Palo Alto with a
large white goose egg.
Lee's second-stringers didn't warm
the bench long as a new unit went
in only nine minutes after the game
started.
The men in green made a bold but
vain bid against the new team, with
rangy Norm Keeler as the spearhead
of the attack. The dark-skinned
Palo Alto forward was the out
standing man for the losers, showing
much-needed aggressiveness that his
mates lacked.
COMPLETE CONTROL
Lee's men controlled the ball at
all times. Wreisner and Pollard, the
tv/o tallest men on the squad, made
their opponents look silly as they
towered over them, intercepting
passes and generally breaking up
the slow Paly offense.
West filled in nicely for Hooper,
handling the ball with ease and feed
ing Pollard and Wreisner beauti
fully-timed passes for the six-foot
ers to sink.
MANY CARI) SUBS
Bill Brubaker and bespectacled
Honry Lew, a couple of boys who |
don't get in very often, broke into
the scoring column to swell the
frosh total. Lee substituted freely
in the second half, and fourteen men
saw action before the game was
over.
Pollard topped the bucket parade
with 13 points, Keeler of Palo Alto
was second with 11, and Wreisner
came next with 10.
San Mateo is next on the schedule.
The game is scheduled for Friday
night in the Pavilion, preceding the
varsity-Trojan titanic.
