# Cardinal Golfers Play in Tourney
## 
### 
Three Stanford men started the 72-
hole grind of the $5000 Oakland Open
Golf Tournament. None finished.
Sid Hayes, better known as a
hurdler on the track team, was first
to leave the play, as his first round
score of 83 wasn't good enough to
keep him in competition.
Gordie Hough, senior member of
the golf team, posted a 36-hole total
of 157, which was three strokes over
the qualifying mark, so Hough had
to leave the tournament at the end
of the second day.
Warren Berl, Indian golf captain,
finished the third round with 228
strokes, one too many to enable him
to start the final round of play on
Sunday.

A hydroelectric generating plant
to cost $3,210,000 is to be constructed
by the Pacific Gas and Elect*' Com
pany at Dutch Flat on the riear
Kiver, Nevada County.
