# Ruggers to Flay University Club
## 
### 
With the first game of the season
coming up Saturday, Stanford's star
studded rugby team, under the di
rection of Harry Maloney and Jim
Wylie, has been fighting rain and
the consequent lack of practice to
round itself into shape. The rug
gers face the University Club Sat
urday afternoon, weather permit
ting.
Many of the Rose Bowlers are
playing on the team with All-
American Frankie Albert and Pete
Kmetovic flashing. Ned Pugh, Art
Geissler, and Jake Thompson, an
other football man, are some of the
returning veterans from last year's
team.
The Indians will center their at
tack around the blazing speed of
Kmetovic and the consistent play of
the other veterans. Missing from the
outfit via graduation will be Hugh
Gallarneau and George Jedenoff,
among others.
Nothing is known of the Univer
sity Club except that it is composed
: of graduates from the University of
j California.
