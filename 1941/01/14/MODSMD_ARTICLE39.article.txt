# Cagers Take Things Easy, Roll Over U.S.F., 45-30; Boh Penn Scores 16 Points
## 
### 
Coach Everett Dean uncovered a
hot-shot forward on his squad last
night, as lanky Bob Penn, reserve
forward, led Stanford's Indians to a
45-30 victory over the U.S.F. Dons
in the Pavilion.
Penn's shooting, which garnered
him high scoring honors with 1G
points, was the only highlight in a
game that was extremely dull and
sloppy. Of the Stanford first quintet
only Bill Cowden and Fordy An
derson started the contest, with Ken
Davidson and Don Williams coming
in for a few minutes in the second
half. Don Burness did no playing
whatsoever.
Even when they were in the game,
the Indian five that is supposed to
be THE basketball team of the Pa
cific Coast didn't do a great deal to
pull away from the Dons. As a mat
ter of fact, Stanford looked just as
good—and at times better—when a
team made up of Jack Dana, Bob
Penn, Ed Voss, Bob Wensel, and
John Alltucker was handling the
situation for the Indians.
Penn just wouldn't be denied
when he was near the bucket, fight
ing and scrambling for the ball all
the time. Most of Penn's points were
the result of his follow shots where
he used his height to good advan
tage in grabbing the ball out of the
melee.
Bob Burman, center, led the U.S.F.
scorers with 10 points, but it was
the work of Irwin Bafigo, a husky
reserve forward, that surprised for
the Dons. Bafigo played but a short
time, leaving the game midway in
the second half on four personal
fouls, but during his stay he whipped
in three field goals that came just
when the Dons needed them most.
A ten-minute period of scoreless
ness on the part of the Indians put
them behind, 10-6, midway in the
first half, but Cowden and Penn hit
for a pair of field goals and Penn,
Voss, and Wenzel added a point
apiece from the free-throw line to
send Stanford into a lead they re
fused to relinquish for the remain
der of the game.

By dint of Penn's 13 points in the
first half, the Indians ended the !
canto with a lead of four points at
24-20.
Little Freddy Linari, another sub
stitute, showed a flash of form when
he got in, tossing in two buckets in
the final minutes of play.
