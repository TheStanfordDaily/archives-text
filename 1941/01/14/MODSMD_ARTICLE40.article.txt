# Menlo Rugby Team Loses Game, 6-0
## 
### 
The Pctaluma Athletic Club,
strengthened by several University
of San Francisco players, defeated
the Menlo Ramblers rugby team 6-0
yesterday on the north bay field.
Petaluma scored on a penalty kick
and a try.
Paired with Petaluma's unexpected
strength was the fact that the Ram
blers were weakened by the loss of
Bob DeLuca and Clarke Congdon.
