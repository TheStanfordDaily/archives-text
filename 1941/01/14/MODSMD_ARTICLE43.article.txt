r Farm on the whole isn't quite
aware of it yet, but in just ten
! days the region in the immediate
vicinity of the Pavilion will prob
ably bear a striking resemblance to
a bombed area in London.
For on the eve preceeding the
night of January 29, to be exact,
will take place what promises to be
I the greatest event in the history of
| the Marquis of Queensbury sport
I here at Stanford.
Johnny Ward and Vie Lind
skog will meet in the heavyweight
division of the All-University
Championships, sponsored by the
Circle S.
There have been good fights in
j the Pavilion ring before, they tell
me, but this bout is likely to put
them all in the shade. The con
testants are both fine amateur fight
ers, and if they chose to go into the
professional ring might not fare too
badly.
Ward's fistic prowess is well
known to most Farm students.
Johnny wasn't in school during the
boxing season last year, but the
year before that he was unbeatable
against what competition could be
found for him.
* # *
experts have gone so far as
to call him the best heavyweight
on the Coast, either amateur or pro
fessional. That's going a long way,
but there's a good deal of justifica
tion for the belief.
He carries a terrific punch in
either hand, is rugged, hard to
hit, and hard to hurt when hit. He
usually carries the fight to his op
ponent. is aggressive enough to
make any bout he's in interesting.
Unlike many college boxers, Ward
takes the sport very seriously. He
trains hard and trains all the time,
and as a result is always in good
condition. Due to a lack of real

i competition — someone who could
live him a stiff fight—his real abil
ity h--»s probably never been fully
tested.
♦. * •
better known as a
football player, hasn't been 1
.seen in action with the gloves here,
but his reputation is such that he
should give Ward a tough buttle.
Boxers who have seen him work out
in the gym, however, say that he's
got what it takes.
He came to Stanford fistic circles
with a long string of victories behind
him, included among them a win
that gave him a Golden Glove cham
pionship. As that's the fastest com
pany in amateur boxing, Lindskog
must be quite proficient with his
dukes.
Because he competed in a Gold
en Gloves tourney, Lindskog is not
eligible to fight on the Stanford
boxing team, according to amateur
hexing regulations. But both
Lindskog and Ward are big boys,
so far over the light-heavy limit
that they couldn't be used in the
| same mateli anyway, and a serious
threat to either is not likely to ;
arise in ordinary college compe
i tition.

r Farm on the whole isn't quite

For on the eve preceeding the
night of January 29, to be exact,
will take place what promises to be
I the greatest event in the history of

I here at Stanford.
Johnny Ward and Vie Lind
skog will meet in the heavyweight
division of the All-University
Championships, sponsored by the
Circle S.
There have been good fights in
j the Pavilion ring before, they tell
me, but this bout is likely to put
them all in the shade. The con
testants are both fine amateur fight
ers, and if they chose to go into the
professional ring might not fare too
badly.
Ward's fistic prowess is well
known to most Farm students.
Johnny wasn't in school during the
boxing season last year, but the
year before that he was unbeatable
against what competition could be
found for him.
* # *
experts have gone so far as
to call him the best heavyweight
on the Coast, either amateur or pro
fessional. That's going a long way,
but there's a good deal of justifica
tion for the belief.
He carries a terrific punch in
either hand, is rugged, hard to
hit, and hard to hurt when hit. He
usually carries the fight to his op
ponent. is aggressive enough to
make any bout he's in interesting.
Unlike many college boxers, Ward
takes the sport very seriously. He
trains hard and trains all the time,
and as a result is always in good
condition. Due to a lack of real

i competition — someone who could
live him a stiff fight—his real abil
ity h--»s probably never been fully
tested.
♦. * •
better known as a
football player, hasn't been 1
.seen in action with the gloves here,
but his reputation is such that he
should give Ward a tough buttle.
Boxers who have seen him work out
in the gym, however, say that he's
got what it takes.
He came to Stanford fistic circles
with a long string of victories behind
him, included among them a win
that gave him a Golden Glove cham
pionship. As that's the fastest com
pany in amateur boxing, Lindskog
must be quite proficient with his
dukes.
Because he competed in a Gold
en Gloves tourney, Lindskog is not
eligible to fight on the Stanford
boxing team, according to amateur
hexing regulations. But both
Lindskog and Ward are big boys,
so far over the light-heavy limit
that they couldn't be used in the
| same mateli anyway, and a serious
threat to either is not likely to ;
arise in ordinary college compe
i tition.
