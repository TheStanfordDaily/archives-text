NOW that Bill Ellington has announced his
contract as assistant track mentor will not
be renewed when it expires next August the
whole muddled situation deserves a good air
ing.
The declaration of the Board of Athletic Con
trol's action had to come from Mr. Ellington,
however. It would have been unfair for the
Board to issue statements to the press and the
public after its Sunday meeting before it noti
fied Bill of its decision. Had he so chosen, Bill
might never have released the news to the
v/orld in general. He might have gone ahead
during the ensuing season in his present ca
pacity. It is understandable that such a posi
tion would be unbearable to a man who has
served Stanford so well for such a long time.
The action of the B.A.C. was not a unanimous
one. It did not have the support of every mem
ber of the body. In fact, student representatives
on the Board differed with the majority view.
As a member of the B.A.C. who is unable to
cast a vote and is merely present at the courtesy
of that group, this writer is not at liberty to
reveal confidential proceedings of the body.
But he can say that, to a man, every student
present, together with one faculty representa
tive, sought to retain the services of Bill Elling
ton for another year.
In all fairness to the Board, however, it can
be said that its action was designed to further
the interests of future track squads on the Farm.
It felt that Mr. Ellington and Mr. Johnson had
developed divergent methods of coaching that
could never be reconciled.
A disciple of Dink Templeton, Bill Ellington
follows the school of training which Templeton
shaped. After working under Dink for so many
years it would be impossible for Ellington to
have perfected any other scheme. Mr. John
son's technique is opposed to the Templeton
school. To have an assistant coach and a head
coach differing as to procedure would prove
disastrous to morale and performance of Farm
track outfits.
Last spring the Board of Athletic Control
signed a contract with Pitch Johnson for five
years' service. It signed a contract with Bill
Ellington for one year's service. When it be
came apparent that dissension might exist in the
ranks of trackmen, the Board was forced to take
some action—regardless of the ability of either
coach.
It chose to notify Bill Ellington that, seven
months from now, he would no longer be a
part of the athletic picture on the Farm.
That action may or may not have been wise.
This writer believes it was not. He believes
that Bill Ellington should have been retained.
He is inclined to think that the B.A.C.'s original
error was made last spring and that these sub
sequent repercussions might have been elimi
nated by more intelligent decision when the
opportunity was fresh.
But today Stanford must face the facts. The
B.A.C. has .increased its unpopularity, even
though its motives were supposedly sincere.
There is nothing that the student body, indi
vidually or collectively, can say to Bill Elling
ton except, in an unavailing way, "Good luck,
Bill."

have perfected any other scheme. Mr. John
son's technique is opposed to the Templeton
school. To have an assistant coach and a head
coach differing as to procedure would prove
disastrous to morale and performance of Farm
track outfits.
Last spring the Board of Athletic Control
signed a contract with Pitch Johnson for five
years' service. It signed a contract with Bill
Ellington for one year's service. When it be
came apparent that dissension might exist in the
ranks of trackmen, the Board was forced to take
some action—regardless of the ability of either
coach.
It chose to notify Bill Ellington that, seven
months from now, he would no longer be a
part of the athletic picture on the Farm.
That action may or may not have been wise.
This writer believes it was not. He believes
that Bill Ellington should have been retained.
He is inclined to think that the B.A.C.'s original
error was made last spring and that these sub
sequent repercussions might have been elimi
nated by more intelligent decision when the
opportunity was fresh.
But today Stanford must face the facts. The
B.A.C. has .increased its unpopularity, even
though its motives were supposedly sincere.
There is nothing that the student body, indi
vidually or collectively, can say to Bill Elling
ton except, in an unavailing way, "Good luck,
Bill."
NOW that Bill Ellington has announced his
contract as assistant track mentor will not
be renewed when it expires next August the
whole muddled situation deserves a good air
ing.
The declaration of the Board of Athletic Con
trol's action had to come from Mr. Ellington,
however. It would have been unfair for the
Board to issue statements to the press and the
public after its Sunday meeting before it noti
fied Bill of its decision. Had he so chosen, Bill
might never have released the news to the
v/orld in general. He might have gone ahead
during the ensuing season in his present ca
pacity. It is understandable that such a posi
tion would be unbearable to a man who has
served Stanford so well for such a long time.
The action of the B.A.C. was not a unanimous
one. It did not have the support of every mem
ber of the body. In fact, student representatives
on the Board differed with the majority view.
As a member of the B.A.C. who is unable to
cast a vote and is merely present at the courtesy
of that group, this writer is not at liberty to
reveal confidential proceedings of the body.
But he can say that, to a man, every student
present, together with one faculty representa
tive, sought to retain the services of Bill Elling
ton for another year.
In all fairness to the Board, however, it can
be said that its action was designed to further
the interests of future track squads on the Farm.
It felt that Mr. Ellington and Mr. Johnson had
developed divergent methods of coaching that
could never be reconciled.
