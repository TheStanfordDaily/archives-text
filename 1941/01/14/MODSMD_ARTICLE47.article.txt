# A 						Stanford Friend
## 
### 
WHILE the University is celebrating its fif
tieth birthday, it is appropriate to remem
ber that the University has been built up by
men and women who have faith in Stanford and
in the products Stanford turns out.
George E. Gamble, Palo Alto mining engi
neer, is one of these. Nine Stanford students
are being helped this year to get an education
by the George E. Gamble scholarships, estab
lished by Mr. Gamble in 1934 on an endow
ment which now approaches $80,000.
Although he was a member of the wealthy
family connected with Procter & Gamble, soap
manufacturers, Mr. Gamble as a student here
in the class of 1905 was impressed by the
struggles of his self-supporting classmates to
carry the burden of their courses while earning
their way through college.
Yesterday was Mr. Gamble's birthday, and
it's safe to guess that he is a few years older
than the University. Stanford's students wish
him many happy returns.
