Y OU reacl in yesterday's Daily about Betty Avery
and "Redhot" Turner being the winning team in
Professor Puzzlewit's radio quiz for a national shoe
company. But that's only the surface information.
What really happened was—
Well, first, your leader, everybody's leader, Ned
Pugh, was asked what was a pack-rat. Keeping up
the flourishing tradition of campus leaders, Ned thought
over his question a while. At last he spoke.
"A pack-rat is a little rat," he mumbled above the
dripping of perspiration, "a little rat—that has a
pack on its back like a kangaroo has on its stomach."
And, by golly, that actually stumped Professor
Puzzlewit. He puffed and said he wasn't sure whether
that was the truth or not. Then he pleaded with Ned
for more information concerning the pack-rat.
Well, Ned finally gulped out enough information to
put it over on the puzzled Professor Puzzlewit.
Incidentally, Leader Ned has a Bawlout average of
142 plus 268, 'way better than a B-plus average. But
that doesn't include information on pack-rats.
AND so the program for 't'he shoe with no soul"
(ouch!) plodded on.
Next on the menu was Miss Sylvia Wilcox Berry—
another leader, according to rumors that are brewing
up the Row. Miss Berry has a grade-point average of
88 plus 163, which, dear readers, is just one little
point below being straight A or God himself.
Incidentally, with such an average, Sylvia is the
logical choice for the next president of this University,
And also, now that we're back on the subject, Sylvia
spends a great deal of her time over in the Speech and
Drama Department. So Professor Half—correction—
Puzzlewit asked her who was Emperor Jones.
She thought and she thought—and nothing hap
pened. As a result she was awarded third prize—27
pairs of basketball sneakers.

and stuff plodded on. And guess who, kid.
Well, next up was Annabclle Clark, who was a
big gun last year, head of Women's Conference, and
was so smart that this year she is taking graduate
work.
Miss Clark—it still is Miss, isn't it?—was given
about six questions; She answered one.
Ross Anderson, another campus leader, didn't know
why Harry Hopkins was in the news. Well—gosh, why
was he? (Weak laugh.)
All this adds up to show the value of a college edu
cation. Broadening, isn't it?
Added note for the day: A cackling voice just in
formed us over the phone that "someone" took the
900-pound bell from the El Campo eating club last
night and placed it on President Wilbur's front door
step.
You take it from here.
