EDITOR, SIR:
This letter is written in the hope that it may be
called to the attention of at least a few Stanford par
ents —particularly the parents of Roble women. It is a
plea for these parents to leave their daughters alone
during rushing, and after rushing, unless, of course,
the daughters ask for help and advice.
This letter is in no sense to be construed as an
indictment of parental interest in general or motherly
love in particular. It is just a statement of certain
facts about the Stanford rushing system and the psy
chology of woman rushees.
Clearly, of the 250 women in Roble, there are many
who, for a variety of reasons, are not sorority material.
But no one has ever made the statement that the
Stanford sororities pledge every worth while girl in
Roble. Far more than 90 women (the average annual
row quota) qualify under the somewhat nebulous rules
of "sorority material." Of these, many are overlooked
because of the difficult rushing system, and many sim
ply "do not choose to run."
* * * *
The problem of parental interference is one of the
greatest faced by Roble's harried sponsors and fresh
men. These fall into two classes: (1) the parent who,
either because of affiliations or inclinations, wishes
daughter to pledge one particular house, (2) the par
ent who just wants daughter to "make" a sorority.
In the first case, the bewildered rushee, faced with
what seems like the first momentous adult decision of
her life, may, because of loyalty to her parents, pledge
a house to which she is unsuited. Or if the house
sensibly realized her lack of suitability and does not
pledge her, the situation may be even worse. Often,
in the second instance, alumni connections are rallied
into action, embarrassing both the sorority and the un
pledged rushee. But, more important, the girl must en
dure tearful bitter phone calls from her parents, and
questions certainly not designed to aid her peace of
mind.
In the second case, the situation is even more un
pleasant, for, if the girl does not pledge at all, either
from choice or involuntarily, she must not only endure
the recriminations and countless questions, she must
battle the sense of "not having made the grade" in
culcated in her by parents whose regard for the
sorority system is based on "snob" appeal.

Of course, understanding advice from a girl's par
ents is invaluable. But, in the event that parents arc
not prepared to give that sort of advice, it would be
better if they absented themselves from the situation
entirely.
The girl who wished to pledge and did not has a
difficult adjustment to make, one which requires sym
pathy as well as a few lectures designed to bolster
her morale. Sympathy alone, no matter how well
meant, can only make her sorry for herself. Cer
tainly recriminations will not help. The girl who did
not pledge from choice undoubtedly had good rea
sons. Her parents arc entitled to an explanation, but
the decision itself is not for them to question. She
has a right to choose the conditions under which she
will live for the next three years.
The girl who pledged a house other than the one
her parents desired her to pledge is perhaps the most
ticklish problem of all. She chose that house because
she liked the women in it. Query and comment on the
subject will only split her loyalties. Since she is old
enough to choose her friends, it is certainly up to
her parents to accept them, at least until they have
good reason not to do so.

love in particular. It is just a statement of certain
facts about the Stanford rushing system and the psy
chology of woman rushees.
Clearly, of the 250 women in Roble, there are many
who, for a variety of reasons, are not sorority material.
But no one has ever made the statement that the
Stanford sororities pledge every worth while girl in
Roble. Far more than 90 women (the average annual
row quota) qualify under the somewhat nebulous rules
of "sorority material." Of these, many are overlooked
because of the difficult rushing system, and many sim
ply "do not choose to run."
* * * *
The problem of parental interference is one of the
greatest faced by Roble's harried sponsors and fresh
men. These fall into two classes: (1) the parent who,
either because of affiliations or inclinations, wishes
daughter to pledge one particular house, (2) the par
ent who just wants daughter to "make" a sorority.
In the first case, the bewildered rushee, faced with
what seems like the first momentous adult decision of
her life, may, because of loyalty to her parents, pledge
a house to which she is unsuited. Or if the house
sensibly realized her lack of suitability and does not
pledge her, the situation may be even worse. Often,
in the second instance, alumni connections are rallied
into action, embarrassing both the sorority and the un
pledged rushee. But, more important, the girl must en
dure tearful bitter phone calls from her parents, and
questions certainly not designed to aid her peace of
mind.
In the second case, the situation is even more un
pleasant, for, if the girl does not pledge at all, either
from choice or involuntarily, she must not only endure
the recriminations and countless questions, she must
battle the sense of "not having made the grade" in
culcated in her by parents whose regard for the
sorority system is based on "snob" appeal.

Of course, understanding advice from a girl's par
ents is invaluable. But, in the event that parents arc
not prepared to give that sort of advice, it would be
better if they absented themselves from the situation
entirely.
The girl who wished to pledge and did not has a
difficult adjustment to make, one which requires sym
pathy as well as a few lectures designed to bolster
her morale. Sympathy alone, no matter how well
meant, can only make her sorry for herself. Cer
tainly recriminations will not help. The girl who did
not pledge from choice undoubtedly had good rea
sons. Her parents arc entitled to an explanation, but
the decision itself is not for them to question. She
has a right to choose the conditions under which she
will live for the next three years.
The girl who pledged a house other than the one
her parents desired her to pledge is perhaps the most
ticklish problem of all. She chose that house because
she liked the women in it. Query and comment on the
subject will only split her loyalties. Since she is old
enough to choose her friends, it is certainly up to
her parents to accept them, at least until they have
good reason not to do so.
