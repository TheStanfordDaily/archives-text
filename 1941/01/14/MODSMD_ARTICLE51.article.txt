# Paganini's Story Theme Of New Komroff Novel
## 
### 
"THE MAGIC BOW," by Man
uel KomrofT.
In the field of romanticized history
there are very few writers who can
beat Manuel KomrofT. This state
ment, of course, applies to writing
of the caliber he exhibited in the
magnificent "Coronet" and some of
his better short stories, and not the
second rates effort, '"Two Thieves."
Up to his old tricks again in "The
Magic Bow" or "A Romance of
Paganini," the master has turned out
a fascinating yarn about the famous
violinist whose name was known in
every corner of Europe during the
first half of the nineteenth century.
But, few people, then as now,
knew more than Paganini's name,
although those living in the large
cities of Europe did have the privi
lege of hearing his music. (He is
considered by many to have been
the greatest violinist of all time.)
Because of the secrecy surround
ing his activities, he was called a
disciple of the devil, a charlatan, and
many other things. No doubt either
he or his manager was smart
enough to capitalize on this aura of
mystery.
Without doing a little research on
the subject, it would be impossible
for the layman to know whether the
book is accurate in its delineation
of Paganini's fabulous history. How
ever, accurate or not, it's interesting,
and that's what counts.
The book deals with the first years
of the artist's life, stopping as he
enters on the European phase of his
career in Vienna. At 20 Paganini
won his violin, a Stradivarius, by
playing a wealthy musician's con
certo by sight. With the violin, he
played his first concert, the one at
which he made history by contin
uing right through when his E
string snapped. It was this trick of
transposition which led to the now
well known Bach air played on the
G-string.
Many of the famous stories about
Paganini are explained logically, at
least in this story—how he came to
tune his* strings slightly off key;
where the legends of his having
sold his soul to the devil came
from; the origin of his heavy, broad

bow; and where he got his unusual
Guarnarius.
Aside from the story of Paganini
himself, the best vignette in the
book concerns the strange monk,
whose deranged mind somehow
linked Paganini's unusual bow with
the powers of evil. The love story
is trite, and the character of the
little countess is vague and un
important.—Nowell
