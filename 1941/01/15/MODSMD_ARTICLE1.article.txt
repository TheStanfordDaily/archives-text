### BOB LOW 
Great Britain and France
are at odds is not news, but
yesterday rumors that the two
former allies were on their way
toward better relations were dis
pelled.
At the time of the Oran incident
last summer — when units of the
British fleet demolished several of
the largest ships of the French navy
in order to prevent them from fall
ing into German hands —it ap
peared that the break between
France and England might reach the
point where France would actively
participate in the war on the side
of Germany.
Since that time, the gov
ernment has not indicated officially
its attitude toward Britain. How
ever, without any declaration of
policy foreign observers in France
have intimated that with the re
moval of Pierre Laval from the
Vichy government relations between
Britain and France might be counted
upon to improve.
The controlled French press yes
terday fired at Britain the strong
est criticism of the British heard
in France for some time. The
occasion for the outburst was a
speech delivered by Alfred DufT
Cooper from London to Latin
America.
According to a United Press dis
patch, the entire propaganda hand
out was devoted to a French rebut
tal of Duff Cooper's speech.
The French government's state
ment asserted that Britain for cen
turies had despoiled the Lati' pow
ers' colonial empires for the gran
deur of the British Empire.
Obviuusly, such "'ords coming
directly and officially from the
French government indicate that
Britain and France are far from
reconciling their differences.
And this attitude on the part of
the Vichy government may have
ramifications in other parts of the
world.
Since the capitulation of France
last June, no one in the United
States has known what action the
French armies in the Near East and
in North Africa would take. In fact,
nothing definite has been written to
indicate whether these sizeable
bodies of troops had decided to fol
low the Vichy government or
whether they would break and take
up the standard of General De-
Gaulle's Free French Government
operating from London.

JpROM reports slipping out from
occupied France and especially
from Paris, it may be assumed that
German propaganda is having con
siderable weight in winning the
French people away from their
former allies.
French troops, whether in the
Near East or in North Africa, will
be affected to some extent by the
changing attitude of the people at
home. Communication between con
tinental France and almost-isolated
detachments of French troops can
not be good at the present time.
However, there is no question
that the sentiments of the Vichy
government and Oi the French peo
ple reach these men. Radio ad
dresses from the new capital, per
haps some letters and newspapers,
have reached unquestionably these
men.
French hatred of the German
people will not he altered appre
ciably by any amount of Nazi
propaganda, hut French friend
ship for the British, never too
strong, might be broken more
easily.
The attitude or even the exact
whereabouts of the remaining
French troops has not been known
or at least disclosed to the outside
world since the fall of France. But
statements like the one yesterday
from the government in Vichy must
be regarded ominously.
France is now under a totalitarian
regime, and the people have no
other voice to listen to than to that
of government spokesmen. This
type of propaganda is sure to have
its effect both upon people within
France and troops remaining under
arms in other parts of the world.
California will reecive $5,616,544
in federal aid in 1941-42 for high
way improvements and grade
crossing elimination.
