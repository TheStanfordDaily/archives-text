# ALL THAT'S LEFT OF SIDI BARRANI

### 

LITTLE REMAINED of Sidi Barrani, Italy's advance base in Egypt, after the British bombarded it from
land, sea and air. Once a strong fort, it is now reduced to a heap of rubble. In the foreground of the
above photo, a captured Italian motor transport proceeds to the rear past ruins of the fort.
