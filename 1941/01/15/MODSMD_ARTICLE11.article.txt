# "J'accuse..."
## 
### 
"Last night the Board of Athletic Control of Stanford Univer
sity fired Bill Ellington, the man who had just coached performers
who had broken three world's records and tied another, the man
who had given Stanford the greatest track team it had probably
ever had. The explanation given by the Board—its members
could not be reached for personal statements—was that Ellington
and Johnson could not successfully coach track together. John
son emphatically denies this.

"Johnson first appeared here at Stanford this fall. He was
appointed coach over a year ago after Templeton's resignation.
In the Jiort time he has been here, he has impressed us all as
a very competent coach and an extremely likeable fellow who
would fit easily into the Stanford scene. However, we were all
amazed at the appointment as Ellington seemed the logical suc
cessor to Dink Templeton. Ellington's skill is disputed by no one.
In the period between Templeton's resignation and Johnson's
taking up the duties of head coach this fall, Ellington served as
head coach. His record last year has been called by everyone
lemarkable. And what is more important to us, the members of
the team, a better time was never had by any track team. A
coach was never better liked. Everyone likes and respects
"Old Bill."

"How the Board of Athletic Control can fire arbitrarily, with
out any discussion, without any regard for the wishes of the
student members of the Board, a man of this caliber we are sure
is inexplicable to any man who has made his "S" at Stanford.
"We realize the Board, after its successful appointment of
Clark Shaughnessy, feels it is living among the gods on Mount
Olympus. And since the gods can do no wrong, they apparently
have no regard for anyone's feelings or economic status, even
if that person has been around Stanford for fifteen years and
has been very competent and popular to boot.
"We also realize that the Board from its lofty heights will pay
no attention to any mundane popular student opinion, no matter
how wholehearted it might be. We are simply voicing our pro
test in behalf of a fine man who we think has been given a
rotten deal.
"Good luck to you, Bill. And we hope, as you do, that Stan
ford may someday have beneficent and capable management
of its athletic affairs."

no attention to any mundane popular student opinion, no matter
how wholehearted it might be. We are simply voicing our pro
test in behalf of a fine man who we think has been given a
rotten deal.

ford may someday have beneficent and capable management
of its athletic affairs."

"Last night the Board of Athletic Control of Stanford Univer
sity fired Bill Ellington, the man who had just coached performers
who had broken three world's records and tied another, the man
who had given Stanford the greatest track team it had probably
ever had. The explanation given by the Board—its members
could not be reached for personal statements—was that Ellington
and Johnson could not successfully coach track together. John
son emphatically denies this.

"Johnson first appeared here at Stanford this fall. He was
appointed coach over a year ago after Templeton's resignation.
In the Jiort time he has been here, he has impressed us all as
a very competent coach and an extremely likeable fellow who
would fit easily into the Stanford scene. However, we were all
amazed at the appointment as Ellington seemed the logical suc
cessor to Dink Templeton. Ellington's skill is disputed by no one.
In the period between Templeton's resignation and Johnson's
taking up the duties of head coach this fall, Ellington served as
head coach. His record last year has been called by everyone
lemarkable. And what is more important to us, the members of
the team, a better time was never had by any track team. A
coach was never better liked. Everyone likes and respects
"Old Bill."

"How the Board of Athletic Control can fire arbitrarily, with
out any discussion, without any regard for the wishes of the
student members of the Board, a man of this caliber we are sure
is inexplicable to any man who has made his "S" at Stanford.
"We realize the Board, after its successful appointment of
Clark Shaughnessy, feels it is living among the gods on Mount
Olympus. And since the gods can do no wrong, they apparently
have no regard for anyone's feelings or economic status, even
if that person has been around Stanford for fifteen years and
has been very competent and popular to boot.
