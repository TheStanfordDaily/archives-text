# Daily Opens New Tryout Period Today
## 
### 
Prospective members of The Daily
editorial staff will attend a meeting
in the Library of the Press Building
at 4 o'clock today, according to an
announcement by Dwight Hutchin
son, editor, today.
Men of the Class of '44 will be es
pecially welcome, according to
Hutchinson, but anyone interested in
working on the paper is urged to
attend this meeting.
Unlike last fall's tryoutee train
ing period, today's meeting will be
the only time that formal instruc
tion in The Daily's style will be
given. Tryoutees will immediately
begin work on the copy desk and
United Press desks, and appoint
ments to the staff will be made on
the basis of work done up to the
second week in February. How
ever, no previous journalism expe
rience is necessary for neophytes.
Hutchinson will briefly address
the tryoutees on The Daily's style,
point and promotion system, and
The Daily as an activity. The meet
ing will be conducted by Mary Etta
Farrell, women's editor.
