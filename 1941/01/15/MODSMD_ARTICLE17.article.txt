# CINDER SQUAD BOMBARDS D.A.C.
## Seventeen Indian Track Competitors Sign Letter Blasting Ellington Sack Team Bitterly Rebukes Board; Lauds Ex-Coach 
### CHUCK SMITH 
The howling tempest of rumor and
fact concerning strife on Stanford's
track team and the release of Assist
ant Cofich Kill Ellington howled to
a climax yesterday with the framing
of a bilter letter written by the mem
bers of the team collectively.
Seventeen members of the Cards'
1941 cinder team yesterday at a
meeting at the Deke house dcided
that it was about time that they, the
persons most affected by the crisis
out on Angell Field which was sup
posedly ended wih the suspension of
Ellington, should be heard from.
The essence of the letter was the
team's objection to the dismissal of
Ellington by the all-powerful Board
of Athletic Control, which the cin
dermen gave a sarcastic verbal lash
ing. Hand in hand with the condem
nation of the B.A.C. was a paragraph
of praise for the tracksters' favorite,
"Wild Bill" Ellington.
OLYMPUS GODS
A deeper significance of the un
precedented letter was the reference
to the Board of Athletic Control as
"gods on Olympus" who feel they
"can fire arbitrarily, without any
discussion, without any regard for
the wishes of the student members
... a man of this caliber."
This seems to coincide with the
feeling that most athletes at Stan
ford are alleged to have had for the
B.A.C. for the past few years: that is,
that the board works according to
only its own wishes, unconscious of
the feelings of the athletes whose
interests they are supposed to be
looking out for.
NO CRITICISM
Conspicuously missing from the
letter was any criticism of Head
Coach Franklin Johnson and his
methods. Contrary to rumors which
have been humming about the cam
pus, the tracksters seem to think
that Johnson had nothing to do with
Ellington's release and that the track
team could get along with two
coaches; for their wrath was hurled
against the B.A.C. alone.
Toward the close of the letter a
note of futility seems to creep in:
"We (the trackmen) also realize
that the board from its lofty heights
will pay no attention to any mun
dane popular student opinion, no
matter how wholehearted it might
be. We are simply voicing our pro
test . . ."
And yet, even though the cinder
men are pessimistic about the ef
fectiveness of their open letter, it is
certainly a clear cut statement of
the students most directly concerned
by his latest and most criticized
action of the B.A.C. in an effort to
remedy the abnormal relationship
between athletes at Stanford and the
body which guides their destiny.
