# F.D.R. Terms Wheeler's Speech 'Rotten Untruth'; Hits 'Unpatriotic' Critics
## President's Angry Outburst in Reply To Senator's 'Plowing Under Every Fourth U.S. Boy' Radio Statement 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 11 (UP). —President Roosevelt today denounced
as "most untruthful, rotten and dastardly" a statement by Sen. Burton K.
Wheeler, I)., Mont., that the New Deal's "triple A" foreign policy, as
embraced by the lend-lease hill, is to "Ipoy under every fourth American
hoy." «

Wheeler, leader of Senate non-in
terventionists, used the phrase in a
radio debate Sunday night. The
President said two or three foes of
the lend-lease bill had employed
the expression and he felt it was
time to kill the slogan at the start.
F.D.R. ANGRY
"I regard it as the most untruth
ful, as the most dastardly, most un
patriotic thing that has ever been
said," he said, his face grim and eyes
flashing. "That really is the rotten
est thing that has been said in public
life in my generation."
He gave correspondents permis
sion to quote him directly—a pro
cedure used only when he wants to
add special emphasis to his words.
Wheeler promptly countered, "Ap
parently the President has lost his
temper.
"I sincerely hope my statement
will be proven to be untrue and no
American boys will be plowed under
because of the Administration's war
minded foreign policy," he said.
"Nothing could be more unpatriotic
than to try to fan the passions of
the American people to the point
where they will accept a program
that will eventually send American
boys to be killed upon foreign
battlefields.
WHEELER REPLIES
"I am not unmindful the Presi
dent has said no American boys
will be se it abroad, but I submit to
the American people that every
speech that has been made by the
President since the election has been
one tending to bring this country
step by step into the foreign war.
"I hope his utterances will not in
timidate other people from express
ing their honest opinions."
The President's outburst came
during a general discussion of the
proposed British aid bill. He re
fused to answer a question whether
he would accept a limitation of the
powers which would be vested in
him, explaining if he answered this
inquiry others would follow at sub
sequent press conferences. He urged
this be avoided.
He was ready with a quick reply,
however, to a query for comment
on the label of "blank check" which
has been applied to his powers un
der the measure. He challenged
correspondents to draft a measure
providing for sufficient power to
turn the United States into an "ar
senal for democracy" which would
not be so labeled.
