# Card Cagers To Battle Trojan Five
## 
### 
With their first conference games
of the season coming up this week
end, Couch Everett Dean and the
Stanford cagers settled down yes
terday to a hard practice schedule
for the rest of the week in prep.tra
tion for their battle with U.S.C. in
the Pavilion this Friday and Satur
day nights.
Coach Dean has planned his prac
tice schedule so that the Indians
will have plenty of time to drill on
the two phases of the game in which
they have seemed weakest in the
last few games, free throws, and
fast break. Drill on the fast break
will be only a part of a general of
fensive practice designed to smooth
out the ever-so-many rough spots
that the Indians have shown in their
victories over Utah Slate, St. Mary's,
Santa Clara, and U.S.F. For it is
quite apparent that Stanford will
have to play better ball to defeat
the always-good Trojans than they
have been playing the last week or
so.
S.F. (JAME NOT TYPICAL
Last night's contest with the
U.S.F. Dons, which Stanford won
45-30, should not be considered a
criterion of the Indians' ability, how
ever, Dean said yesterday. He based
his statement on the fact that he
had no regular combination in the
game for more than a few moments
at a time and that the team mem
bers could arouse no enthusiasm in
a game against a team which had
already lost to Cal's second team.
Despite the fact that there was
some poor offensive play in evidence
in the Stanford - Santa Clara battle
last Saturday night, Dean detected
some heartening points, namely,
Stanford's defensive game and stall
game. But a basketball team has to
make points before it can work its j
stall game.
POOR SHOOTING
One of the things that played
havoc with Stanford's point total in
the Santa Clara game was the poor
shooting from the free-throw line,
where the Indians tanked only 4 out
ot 12 attempts. It seems quite likely
that the reason for this poor show
ing was the fact that the Indians
have been playing two and three
games per week, thus giving them
little time to practice foul shots.
Ordinarily each of the Stanford
cagers shoots from 30 to 40 foul
shots per px-actice session, but up
until this week there just haven't
been enough practice periods. Bill
Cowden and Ed Voss lead the In
dians in free throws with an 80 per
cent average, and Don Williams is
next in line with an average of 70
per cent.
