# Zivic to Face 'Hank' Friday
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 14 (UP).—Henry
Armstrong, seeking greater glory in
the twilight of his career, returns to
the ring Friday night in an attempt
to recapture the welterweight crown
from Fritzic Zivic.
If the chocolate soldier fails in
this attempt, it may be his last battle
—surrender to the marching years
and taps for one of the most amazing
campaigns in pugilistic history.
But Armstrong, veteran of nearly
3i)o amateur and professional fights,
says he won't fail, now that his eyes
have been repaired and his body
energized by a long-needed rest.
Hammering fit nry hasn't fought
for three and a half months; not since
the night of Oct. 4, when he lost the
welter crown to this same Fritzie
Zivic, a strong, clever Pittsburgher
who virtually blinded Armstrong
during 15 thrill-packed rounds.
Armstrong, the only man who
ever held three ring titles simul
taneously, lest the last of his crowns
that night. And in so doing, his eyes
suffered such a battering and gash
ing an operation was necessary on
Ins left eye and long treatments were
needed on his right.
"My eyes are as good as new,
now," says the 23-year-old Los An
geles negro. "Zivic won't be fighting
a blind man this time."
Betting men believe Henry and his
repaired eyes will work better.
