### JERRY BRUCKER 
j reading that letter signed
I by the seventeen members of
the Stanford track team, there's
really very little left to be said con
cerning the B.A.C. action in firing
Bill Ellington. The spikemen got
right at the heart of the situation
and made clear their stand in the'
matter perfectly.
Their course was the wisest to '
follow. They simultaneously placed
a vote of confidence in the middle
man in the recent storm and regis
tered a strong protest against the
drastic work of the Board of Ath
letic Control.
Their censure of the men who
Sunday kicked Old Bill out of what
has been his stamping grounds for
14 years isn't nearly as stiff a pun
ishment as . (hose men deserve for
their vicious bungling of the situa
tion, but it's as stiff as it is in the
power of at<y student group to
make it.
Their wisest action was a negative j
| one. In not going on strike against j
the B.A.C. move they demonstrated
their own intelligence and made the ,
athletic moguls look worse than if j
the team had refused to run. This
| also prevented making a bad situa-
J tion much, worse.
* * *
can be done now to
I make the Board reconsider it's
decision. In a short time the
case of Ihe stabbing of Bill Ellington
j will so down in history along with
the many other mistakes these men
(and we do not include in this cate
gory the student representatives who
> voted against Ihe action) have made
in the past and will make in the fu- '
|ture. No amount of student opinion I
: will serve to keep Bill on the Farm, j
The B.A.C. showed when the 1
older members outvoted the student
representatives that they don't give
a damn what the people who pay
$130 a quarter feel about the mat
ter. They have mishandled the track
situation here at Stanford for a long
iime, and evidently intend to con- '
tinue doing so.
The most ironic part of the whole
mess can be found in the following |
j paragraph, quoted from the pages of
The Stanford Daily, Jan. 5, 1940:
" 'We feci,' said a member of the
B.A.C. after the selection (of Pitch i
Johnson), 'that the election of a new
coach now will preclude any possi
' bility of verbal battles in the local

press and between various alumni
factions. The bad publicity of that
long campaign has been avoided by
the early selection of a truly supe
rior coach.' "
Fine sentiments, those, but the
appointing of a new track coach be
fore the incumbent in the job had
started to develop what proved to
be a great track team is the mistake
that led to the present battle.
* * *
NÂ° ONE wants to fire Pitch John
son before ho has shown what
he can do. Nor, we hope, is any
one going to judge his ability on the
performance of the Cardinal track
men in the coming campaign. Con
sidering the material on hand and
the . phenomenal record of last
yaer's fine runners, that would be
unfair.
Yet they kicked Ellington out of
'he driver's seat without any com
punction just about a year ago. It's
not the hiring of Johnson that's
causing the beef today, nor the de
motion of Ellington; it's the betrayal
of a man who gave Stanford his
time and efforts for 14 years, who
turned down two belter offers to
remain as assistant coach on the
Farm.
We're not too sure of our legal
points, but we're reasonbly certain
that Bill could sue for slander the
man who said his dismissal was be
cause "in ihe future he would not
co-operate."
Anyone who knows Bill at all will
realize that failure to co-operate
would be just as much out of his
line as suing for slander.
We're not going to bid him good
by. We'll wish him the luck he de
serves after two raw deals, but for
the most part we'll just sit here and
cus:-: tho B.A.C. till hell freezes over.
