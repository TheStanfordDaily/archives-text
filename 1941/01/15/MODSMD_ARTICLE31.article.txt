# Frosh Track Prospects Look Good as First Training Begins
## 
### 
With the makings of a team that has a chance to heat the Cal frosh
in the annual Little Big Meet for the first time in many a year, the
'Papoose spikeslers have started work for the coming spring, despite a
muddy track.
The squad will he built around several ex-prep stars that are now in

the Encina fold. Bob Waters from<
Bakersfield looks like a probable
successor to Clyde Jeffrey in the
sprints and maybe quarter-mile. He
won both 100 and 220 from varsity
man Ken Battaglia in the fall meet.
Kenny Taix, a 9.8 century man,
has just enrolled from San Jose and
will ably support Waters in the
dashes.
ABLE DISTANCE MAN
Lanky Bob Compton is expected to
be one of the best frosh distance
men in recent years. Compton ran
the 880 at South Pasadena High last
year, but due to his tremendous
stride he will likely run the longer
races.
Don Riess, state champ in the 120
high hurdles, will lead a strong
group of hurdlers. He comes from
Burlingame. Joe Mardesich, San
Diego gridman who won several in
door interscholastic titles while at
Lawrenceville School in New Jer
sey last year, will give the Papooses
more sure points in the timber-top
ping events.
CiRIDDERS ON TEAM
Three recruits from the freshman
football team will take care of the
weight events. Bill Joslyn of San
Francisco is tabbed to hold up the
Stanford tradition of having the
best discus throwers in the world.
He th row the platter 142 feet in an
autumn meet, which would win
many a college meet.
Number 1 shot putter v/ill be Jean
Lamour, who heaved the 12-pound
shot 54 feet for Fresno High last
spring. He also tosses the discus.
THREE-LETTER MAN
Versatile Johnny Kenward, who
quarterbacks in the fall and sits on
the basketball bench in the winter,
will propel the javelin next spring.
He had previously thrown the spear
at Berkeley High School.
Howard Wright, Compton's team
mate at South Pasadena, is sched
uled to take over the high jump
duties, while Buck Fawcett, erst
while fullback, has done 23 feet in
the broad jump, which is good
enough for firsts against frosh com
petition.
Only worry thus far is the lack of
talent in the pole vault, where nary
a candidate has turned out.
