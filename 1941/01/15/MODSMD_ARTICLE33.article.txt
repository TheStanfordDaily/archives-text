# Frosh to Shine In Glove Event
## 
### 
Dark horses galore have been un
covered by Clayton Frye and Bill
Wilbur, boxing coaches, as they
round the Farm's ringmen into shape
in preparation for the novice and
all-University event to be held Jan.
2!J. Several freshmen who came to
Stanford unheralded are holding the
spotlight as they work out in the
Encina gym daily.
Johnson Chin has been showing
so much class that Frye wants to
put him into the all-University divi
sion instead of the novice. Chin will
fight in either the 135- or 145-pound
class. Not a freshman, but a good
man with his dukes, Ira Fishman is
a man to watch in the 155-pound
novice division.
Besides Fishman, H. Claflin and
Bob Efteland v/ill spar in the 155-
pound class. In the all-University
165-pound group, several talented
boxers have signed or will sign soon.
Ted Bravos, Ken Rosengren, who
fought last year, and John Ryan,
who won the novice crown in his
weight two years ago but quit
school soon after, have placed their
names on the sign-up sheet in the
Encina gym.
The most torrid scrap, except
possibly in the heavyweight class,
will take place in the all-University
155-pound class. Tom Mac Michael,
Jim Thurmond, and Jim McCloud,
all gifted and experienced ringmen.
will sock it out for the golden
gloves in that weight.
