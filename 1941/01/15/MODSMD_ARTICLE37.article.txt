STANFORD student opinion, reacting swiftly
to Bill Ellington's announcement that his
contract with the University will not be re
newed, has fanned into life the smouldering
flame of resentment against the Board of Ath
letic Control.
The Board has always been an unpopular
institution —its very existence and its life-and
death authority over athletic affairs have irri
tated students. Those of us who have been
naive enough to consider college athletics as
an undergraduate matter and not precisely a
big business are frequently disillusioned by
Board actions.
The Board, too, is acutely aware of the un
popular light in which it is held by Stanford
tuition-payers. And yet it seems unable to
remedy its public relations.
Voicing what seems to be the majority view
on the Farm, Jerry Brucker analyzes the track
situation, as it stands to date, in his "Sideline
Slants" column. His ideas are shared rather
generally by the man on the Quad.
However bitterly student voices may cry
"injustice" at the treatment of a gentleman
who has contributed so largely to Stanford's
athletic prowess, they should not damn the
man who was picked by the Board to succeed
Bill Ellington. Pitch Johnson, both as a man
and as an exponent of a system of coaching,
has not had an opportunity to demonstrate his
ability.
When Pitch Johnson accepted the B.A.C.'s
offer last year he did so in good faith. He came
to the Farm one day last August, looked at An
gell Field's smoothly graded oval over which
have paced some of the West's greatest cham
pions. He had signed a five-year contract with
Stanford. His job was a big one—to turn out
teams that could equal or advance the records
that Dink Templeton and Bill Ellington had en
gineered.
Pitch Johnson stepped into the midst of an
athletic mix-up that has seldom been equaled.
When he signed on that dotted line he could
not have realized the dividends of disharmony
that would add up, with compound interest, to
today's startling total.
According to the track team's resolution,
". . . Ellington and Johnson could not success
fully coach track together. Johnson emphati
cally denies this."
Today Bill Ellington is through. Nothing that
student opinion, clamoring at the closed doors
of a Board of Athletic Control meeting, can say
will change that unalterable decree.
But Pitch Johnson will be the Farm's varsity
track chief for four more years. It is not un
reasonable to hope that he be granted some
measure of support and co-operation. In the
interests of Stanford's track future, he deserves
that backing.
