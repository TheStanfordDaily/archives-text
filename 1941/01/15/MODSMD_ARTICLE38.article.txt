# Descent into the Maelstrom

### 
OVER a year ago, The Daily Northwestern,
student publication of Northwestern Uni
versity, came out in its editorial columns en
dorsing a suggestion by the president of North
western that freshmen be advised not to partici
pate in campus activities during their first year
in college.
The editorial pointed out that in university a
student has little enough time to study, to read,
to think. Which is a graphic truth that cannot
be refuted. It is assumed from The Northwest
ern's editorial tone, although it does not say
so specifically, that it would be permissible for
students to enter into activities after their first
year when they are acclimated to the stress of
college life.
Actually, the problem of time becomes more
acute the further along the student gets in his
college career. If The Northwestern's original
premise is carried out to its logical conclusion,
a student has less reason to get into activities
the higher his class. This idea must be deplor
able to Stanford's many embryo politicians who
climb to student offices on a step-ladder of
committee jobs.
However, The Northwestern overlooks com
pletely one of the basic advantages of campus
activities. It is true that the fundamental pur
pose of the university is for developing and
expanding our mental processes, but there is
inextricably involved in a college education
the aspect of personality development. Few
accomplish this than through the medium of

would deny that it is within the legitimate prov
ince of the university to train personality.
And there is no greater or easier way to
social intercourse, the play and interplay of
ideas and varied personalities. And any cam
pus activity, whether it be the student news
paper, the yearbook, the rally committee, or
even a lowly clean-up committee for a school
dance, provides the student with this advan
tageous contact.
Of course, such a thing can be—and fre
guently is—overdone. And naturally, a fresh
man is the one who is likely to lose the most
from too great a concentration on activities to
the exclusion of his studies.
But outside activities have a definite place
in college life. And when they are properly
adjusted to the student's study schedule, there
can be little possible objection to them.
Furthermore, there seems no reason why
freshmen should not step right into the activi
ties cycle. After all, there is nothing like per
sonal experience to discover just how much of
a thing is good for one.—G. M.
