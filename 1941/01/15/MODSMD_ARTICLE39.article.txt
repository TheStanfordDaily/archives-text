# BULL SESSION
## 
### BUD AMES 
JNTO your lives has come a crisis, a crisis so sweep
ing in nature that it threatens to engulf you all.
If you have been in the Cellar during the last few
days ,if you have refreshed yourself with a harmless
looking coke, you ARE engulfed.
Now before going any farther, it is only fair to warn
you that if you have a weak stomach, even slightly
squeamish, well then, turn to the movie review column
or the Bull Board section. This is no place for you.
Now for those of you who are still with us, are you
ready? Hang on, here it comes.
* * * *
JT hasn't been bad liquor. Nor are your eyes going
bad on you. Those little black things you've been
seeing in the bottom of your coke glasses aren't just
imaginary spots. They're really there.
Ghastly isn't it, finishing off a large lemon coke—
the 10-cent size—and then bumping square into a few
of those dark specks in the bottom of the glass?
Now the next and natural question is—
Are they organic or inorganic, man or beast, vege
table or mineral?
To date nobody knows. Nobody knows. And no
body seems to care. They just seem to go on, always
there at the bottom of those paper cups, lurking behind
the hunks of ice. If you haven't noticed them yet, take
a good look at the bottom of your next coke glass.
Then you'll see 'em.
The question is—do they see you too?
Perhaps some hasher dumped a pound of ground
coffee in the coke squirter and the coke into the cof
fee dispenser by mistake. You could hardly tell the
difference. Maybe that has been the trouble with the
coffee that the Campus Opinion letter complained about
a couple of days ago.
Or perhaps the Biology Department put them there.
Certain species of South American phftglslls can live
only in coke syrup, you know. Perhaps those specks
are phftlslls which came north with the Monarch
butterfly migration. And, oh, if you only knew how
phftglslls multiply!

more probably, it is something introduced by
the Nazi agents and spies. What a wonderful
place to hide valuable information—right in the bot
tom of your coke cups, under the ice where nobody
would suspect looking for it.
Well, it's all very mysterious. After all, one does
like to know what one is drinking, doesn't one?
So we just referrde back to our old stand-by
"The Students' Organizations Fund" booklet and dis
covered that last year the Union cleared over $27,000.
This money goes for breakage and for paying for our
new theater.
But surely they can afford one of those new super
eight Take-Specks-Out-of-Cokes machines which are
now on the market. And think how nice it would be
with no spots in your coke.

There's only one word that describes this Elling
ton deal.
