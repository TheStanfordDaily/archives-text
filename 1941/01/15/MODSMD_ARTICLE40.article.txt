GLAMOUR. LTD.
r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
While down L.A. way for the Rose Bowl game
and the other excitement of celebrating a New Year,
I chanced to visit 20th Century Fox Studio. The pass
word which got me through those massive studio
gates was one little word, STANFORD. The gates
opened and I was ushered into the presence of a
mighty "Bigwig" who practically curtsied he was so
GRACIOUS. Of course, I, who had never seen a
studio before was slightly nervous especially after be
ing grimaced at by half-a-dozen movie executives, all
of whom had heard the magic word of Stanford.
"Mr. Bigwig" introduced me to a very Hollywood
ish young man who escorted me through the grounds.
He also was very courteous although he talked much
faster than I (which is very unusual) and asked doz
ens of questions about Stanford's mighty team. I,
being a "fern," know next to nothing about the sci
ence and rules of football, but I managed to praise the
players to such a degree that I wouldn't be in the
least, surprised if they, along with Mr. Shaughnessy,
aren't made glamor boys soon.
Talking of glamor boys, Cesar Romero, upon hear
ing I was from Stanford flashed me that dazzling Cisco
Kid smile. . . . Whoops-de-doo, it's good to be alive,
"especially when you have an "Injun" feather in your
hat.
Although I'm still quite ignorant of movie studios,
my visit was an interesting one for it proved to me
without a doubt
"Our Fame Has Spread"

r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
Most students with automobiles will not pick up
other students who are walking in the damned rain.
And thereby hangs a tale.

A TRACKMAN SPEAKS

r rilE EDITOR, SIR:
As a Stanford student who is out for track I
think it is a rotten deal Bill Ellingotn has gotten. After
giving Stanford so many fine track teams it doesn't
seem right that he should be "fired."
We all think Bill is the finest sort of a fellow. We
also like Pitch Johnson. I believe that these two men
can easily work together and form more outstanding
track teams for Stanford. That is, they could if the
B.A.C. would give them n chance.
Sincerely,
