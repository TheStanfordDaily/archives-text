# Harold Laski Offers Analysis, Solution of British Problems
## 
### 
"WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?" by Harold J. Laski—Viking Press.
Harold Laski, brilliant political theorist and spokesman for Britain's
Labour Party, has written what his publishers inform you on the jacket
is a statement of British democracy—"the cause for which England is
fighting, and the future which she is promising the world."

Whether or not this is entirely so,
—and I think both points are debat
able—Laski here presents a clear
and effective analysis of the present
world situation, its causes and pos
sible outcome, with special emphasis
on Britain's domestic needs at this
time.
His conclusion, the answer to
"Where Do We Go from Here?" in
volves extensive social reforms
within the British Empire: the cur
tailment of the powers and profits of
the privileged class, assurances by
legislation of security to the labor
class, and eventually, when the war
is won, the establishment of a just,
negotiated peace based on the abro
gation of state sovereignty in all
Europe, and the simultaneous abro
gation of all vested interests.
A REAL FIGHT
The last measures, of course, pre
clude a British victoiy. Mr. Laski
sees this victory as the result of a
European revolution which will
burst forth once Britain has taken
the necessary lead in social reform.
Reform which will assure the world
that this war is not a war of impe
rialism but a genuine fight— not to
preserve the institutions of capital
istic democracy that have twice led
the world to the brink of destruc
tion—but to establish a new order
of political and economic equality
such as the world has not yet seen.
If by now you have got the im
pression that Laski's solution for the
ills of the world is a trifle idealistic,
that the post-War Europe he en
visages sounds like a leaf out of Sir
Thomas More, that is precisely the
feeling the book leaves.
VERY DEFEATISM
This sort of reaction is, of course,
the very "defeatism" Mr. Laski is
attempting to combat in his book.
The fact, of course, that there are
numerous flaws in Britain's—and in
our —system which demand reform.
IS INDISPUTABLE
But Mr. Laski is an avowed Marx
ian Socialist, and though this in it
self would not of necessity demolish
arguments, nevertheless there is
constantly the all too vivid picture
of the Soviet before us. Marxian
Socialism hardly seems a practicable
solution. The fact, too, that not once
in his book, even in his most scath
ing condemnations of totalitarianism,
does Mr. Laski rebuke Russia, does
not add to the weight his words
will carry with those of us who are
not "pink."
LOGICAL, BRILLIANT
In spite of this, "Where Do We
Go from Here?" is one of the most
enlightening documents to emerge
from the present conflict. Mr. Laski
is always logical, often brilliant. His
bok Ls challenging and stimulating,
book is challenging and stimulating,
will be an eye-opener; an expose of
what went on behind the doors of
No. 10 Downing Street when Cham
berlain hung his hat there.
For others, it will be merely a
more lucidly stated analysis of what
has been said before. But for all
Americans it will provoke a cau
tious surveyal of our own set-up
and the inquiry: Where should we
go from here?—Reichert

the necessary lead in social reform.
Reform which will assure the world
that this war is not a war of impe
rialism but a genuine fight— not to
preserve the institutions of capital
istic democracy that have twice led
the world to the brink of destruc
tion—but to establish a new order
of political and economic equality
such as the world has not yet seen.
If by now you have got the im
pression that Laski's solution for the
ills of the world is a trifle idealistic,
that the post-War Europe he en
visages sounds like a leaf out of Sir
Thomas More, that is precisely the
feeling the book leaves.
VERY DEFEATISM
This sort of reaction is, of course,
the very "defeatism" Mr. Laski is
attempting to combat in his book.
The fact, of course, that there are
numerous flaws in Britain's—and in
our —system which demand reform.
IS INDISPUTABLE
But Mr. Laski is an avowed Marx
ian Socialist, and though this in it
self would not of necessity demolish
arguments, nevertheless there is
constantly the all too vivid picture
of the Soviet before us. Marxian
Socialism hardly seems a practicable
solution. The fact, too, that not once
in his book, even in his most scath
ing condemnations of totalitarianism,
does Mr. Laski rebuke Russia, does
not add to the weight his words
will carry with those of us who are
not "pink."
LOGICAL, BRILLIANT
In spite of this, "Where Do We
Go from Here?" is one of the most
enlightening documents to emerge
from the present conflict. Mr. Laski
is always logical, often brilliant. His
bok Ls challenging and stimulating,
book is challenging and stimulating,
will be an eye-opener; an expose of
what went on behind the doors of
No. 10 Downing Street when Cham
berlain hung his hat there.
For others, it will be merely a
more lucidly stated analysis of what
has been said before. But for all
Americans it will provoke a cau
tious surveyal of our own set-up
and the inquiry: Where should we
go from here?—Reichert
"WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?" by Harold J. Laski—Viking Press.
Harold Laski, brilliant political theorist and spokesman for Britain's
Labour Party, has written what his publishers inform you on the jacket
is a statement of British democracy—"the cause for which England is
fighting, and the future which she is promising the world."

Whether or not this is entirely so,
—and I think both points are debat
able—Laski here presents a clear
and effective analysis of the present
world situation, its causes and pos
sible outcome, with special emphasis
on Britain's domestic needs at this
time.
His conclusion, the answer to
"Where Do We Go from Here?" in
volves extensive social reforms
within the British Empire: the cur
tailment of the powers and profits of
the privileged class, assurances by
legislation of security to the labor
class, and eventually, when the war
is won, the establishment of a just,
negotiated peace based on the abro
gation of state sovereignty in all
Europe, and the simultaneous abro
gation of all vested interests.
A REAL FIGHT
The last measures, of course, pre
clude a British victoiy. Mr. Laski
sees this victory as the result of a
European revolution which will
burst forth once Britain has taken
the necessary lead in social reform.
