# Cannabalism In Fiji Causes Isolationism
## 
### 
Because Fijians have developed a
severe isolationist complex from
their traditional custom of eating all
visiotrs this group of 250 islands in
the South Seas has remained vir
tually immune from the influence of
western civilization, according to
Herbert E. Knapp. Mr. Knapp il
lustrated his account of life in the
isles with a color film entitled.
"Fiji, Cannibal Land of Yesterday,"
at last night's Tuesday Evening Lec
ture program.
"No one knows for certain
whether cannibalism still exists in
Fiji, but it is highly probable," Mr.
Knapp said. "Fifty years ago boys
celebrated their coming of age by
killing a man for the first time, usu
ally a slave. Another man was
killed for the marriage feast and
four men buried alive under each
post of the newlyweds' house be
fore the couple could move in."
LESS EATING
Since this time cannibalism has
decreased to such an extent that
most of the villages in Viti Levu,
the largest of the islands, are per
fectly safe for visitors. Mr. and
Mrs. Knapp traveled through jun
gles into what were once considered
the most savage locations in the
South Sea cannibal lands.
"As soon as we arrived we were
greeted by the ceremony of the
national drink. This mud-colored
liquid consists of pulverized root
and water, and tastes like licorice
melted with a goodly portion of
mud. Fiji etiquette demands that
an entire cupful be consumed at one
swallow."
WIGGLING DISH
A favoritd dish on the isles is baby
octopus. These are caught and
cooked by the women on special
occasions. Moi'e common seafood is
shellfish.
"One of the first customs we be
came acquainted with after living in
Fiji was 'cari-cari,' the native habit
of acquiring any object in the vil
lage by admiring it. Unfortunately
this applies to visitors, also and Mrs.
Knapp had to watch her clothes to
keep them from disappearing.
POUNI) TAX
In relating the history of the
islands, Mr. Knapp said at one time,
the English decided to impose a per
capita tax of one pound. This was
paid in produce wbich was shipped
down the river. Those who refused
to pay were thrown in jail.
Instead of regarding this action as
a punishment, the natives were
highly delighted with the good food
and luxurious quarters of the Eng
lish jail. They not only tried their
best to be arrested but also brought
their entire families to jail with
them. When they returned home
again they were given the title of
"government man" and were greatly
respected afterwards.
