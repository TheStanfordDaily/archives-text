### 
PLYMOUTH, Eng., Jan. 14 (UP).
—The American-born Lady Astor
took time out from relief work
Tuesday to proclaim the invinci
bility of a people who can take what
Plymouth took Monday night —
10,000 incendiaries and tons of ex
plosives.

Charles S. Teague of Santa Paula
has been re-elected president of the
California Fruit Growers Exchange
for the twentieth consecutive time.
