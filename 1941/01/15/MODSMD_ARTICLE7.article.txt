Ten new living groups were added yesterday to the honor roll lisf
of units contributing 1(10 per cent to the "March of Dimes" campaign under
way over the entire country to raise money for research and treatment
of infanitle paralysis.
Thu complete honor roll now stands as published in the adjoining

column.
With total contributions well over
$50 for the first two days of the
drive, Chairman Bob McNeil an
nounced last night that today was to
be designated as a special day for
students not connected with any
living group to make their contribu
tions in any one of the "wishing
wells" stationed in prominent spots
around the campus.
The drive is being conducted on
the campus by Alpha Phi Omega,
national service fraternity. Organi
zation is by living group repre-

sentatives.
Stanford goal for this year's drive
is $400 or approximately one dime
from every student. Last year Uni
versity research departments re
ceived more than $20,000 from pro
ceeds of the drive.
The drive progress thermometer
will be in front of the Library today.
McNeil reminded the student body
yesterday that this charity is per
sonally sponsored by the President.
