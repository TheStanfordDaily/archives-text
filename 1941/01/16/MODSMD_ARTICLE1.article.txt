r United States is still aiding
the Axis.
That is the declaration that comes
from Britain's Ministry of Economic
Warfare yesterday.
Although the British statement
said that there was no reason to be
lieve that this aid has been delib
erate, the figures released serve to
indicate that there is no doubt that
Americans, most probably unwit
tingly, are still aiding the Axis.
Charges that various American
manufacturers have been shipping
goods which are reshipped to the
Axis have appeared for some time in
various liberal periodicals in the
United States. Most observers have
not placed much faith in these ar
ticles, for they have not contained
proof of these shipments and they
have tended to demonstrate that
whatever shipments finally reached
Italy or Germany must of necessity
be so small as to be of little actual
consequence.
The question has always been,
how could any sizable shipments
reach the Axis intact with Britain
controlling the seas and with United
States ships prohibited from war
zones?

r JpHE British declaration yesterday
answers this question. To quote
the dispatch from the Ministry:
"Some United States producers are
helping Germany indirectly by sell
ing Russia commodities in which
Germany is deficient. Of these, cot
ton is the most important."
The British figures show that
between October 15 and Decem
ber 15, 1940, Russia imported
more cotton from the United
States than she usually imports
from all sources during an entire
year. Russia exported to Germany
2,000,000 lbs. of cotton in 1940 in
accordance with the Soviet-
German trade agreement. Under
the new pact signed last week, it
is proposed to increases Russian
cotton exports to Germany.
"It is clear that such Russian cot
ton exports are possible only be
cause, of Soviet imports from the
United States," the British state
ment said.
"Another important United States
export to Russia is oil drilling and
other oilfield equipment. According
to British information, the Russian
oil output, which is of very direct
interest to Germany, can be main
tained or increased only by the use
of such United States equipment.
Germany cannot provide this
equipment.
"Finally, a good deal of crude
oil is sent to Vladivostok from the
United States, or by way of the
United States, releasing certain
amounts for export to Germany."

facts and figures should not
be taken lightly. It is obvious
that Americans, shipping goods on
Japanese merchantment for the
most part, are aiding the Axis—con
trary to the official foreign policy of
the United States government.
In America, coercion is only the
last resort of govei'nment, and in the
past it has been used to protect
sovereignty itself.
To date, exporting goods that ulti
mately reach the Axis has not been
deemed of sufficient consequence to
demand that the government take
action. However, in the near fu
ture these shipments should be
stopped.
The President has already placed
on a special reserve list certain
goods vital to our own defense in
dustries which may not be exported
under any circumstances.
The President has declared on
more than one occasion that Britain
is America's first-line of defense. To
be consistent in backing up this
policy necessitates the embargo of
all goods that reach Britain's ene
mies. The first step in this direction
would be to investigate the British
facts and figures made public yes
terday.
