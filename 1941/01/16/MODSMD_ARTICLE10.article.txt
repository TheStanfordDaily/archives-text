houses on separate evenings or they
may attend the two dinners at the
same house.
FORMALS REQUIRED
Established garb for these occa
sions is, according to Peg Stanfield,
chairman of Pan Hellenic, formal
dinner dress.
On returning from the last pref
erence dinner Friday night, rushees
will be obliged to state their final
choice of houses. The choice will be
given in one, two, three order.
The expression of preference made
on this occasion is binding, accord

SYSTEM DIFFERS
The system of rushing in opera
tion this year differs from that
formerly used in that there are now
four instead of three periods. This
innovation was brought about in
attempts to avoid, if possible, late
rushing, and to provide greater op
portunity for the people involved in
rushing to get to know each other.
