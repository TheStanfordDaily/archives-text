# Activities Group To Sign Up Men
## 
### 
In the immediate future members
of the Aetivity Files Committee will
visit men's living groups and eating
clubs to sign up all men who failed
to fill in cards last quarter. Though
activity cards for women members
of the student body are nearly 100
per cent complete, only a small per
centage of men have been con
tacted.
Activity Files have added repre
sentatives from Interfraternity and
Interclub councils to insure close
contact with major groups on
campus.
By an Ex Committee ruling, all
committees have to be selected from
the files and approved by the Activ
ity Files chairman, Betty Avery.
Each committee head is required to
report back upon his committee so
the files will be able to furnish a
record of the individual's compe
tence.
