# Noted Pianist Appears Here Monday Night
## Robert Casadesus To Play Selections From Ravel, Chopin 
### 
When Robert Casadesus appears
as soloist at Stanford Monday he will
present a program of piano music
encompassing representative works
of the last three centuries.
Composers represented on the pro
gram range from Beethoven to Ra
vel, with Chopin in between. In
addition Schubert, Schumann and
Chabrier will be heard from.
Mr. Casadesus, who is appearing
as the second in the annual Stanford
Concert Series, was a good friend of
the late Maurice Ravel, famous
French composer who died recently.
It is natural then that he should in
clude on any program of his a com
position by the man whom he ad
mired and respected as a great friend
and composer.
SCHUBERT REPRESENTED
The program will get under way
with Schubert's "Sonata in A Major."
This work is typical of Schubert's
romantic music; it is melodious and
singable.
Beethoven's "Sonata in F Minor"
should prove to be the highlight of
the program. It has the favored spot
just preceding the intermission and
is the most difficult and dramaitc
work Casadesus will play.
Following the intermission, Mr.
Casadesus will return to play "Pa
pillons" by Schumannâ€”a work ex
acting in its technical aspects for any
pianist.
TICKETS AVAILABLE
Next follows Ravel's "Sonatine"
and Chabrier's "Bouree fantastique,"
which will close the program. The
latter work is typical of this French
composer, who preceded the modern
period. It is strongly reminiscent
of Ravel and Debussy in its bril
liance and wit.
Tickets for this and following con
certs are now available at the Con
cert Series office in Old Union. Two
more concerts are scheduled for the
season: Dorothy May nor, soprano,
and Nino Martini, tenor.
