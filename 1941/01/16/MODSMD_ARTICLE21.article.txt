# Rabbi Addresses Luncheon Club
## 
### 
Rabbi Gordon, a member of the
Berkeley Hillel Foundation, traced
the activities of the Jew from the
Middle Ages to modern times yes
terday noon at the Luncheon Club.
He made an earnest plea for de
mocracy by stressing the fact that
"all non-conformists," not only Jews
but all minorities, are being perse
cuted in Europe today.
He told of the position of the Jew
from the French Revolution with its
spirit of liberty, equality, and fra
ternity which liberated his people
from their Middle Aged ghetto, to
the modern crisii. During this lat
ter event the Jews have enjoyed a
measure of freedom in certain sec
tions of the world.
