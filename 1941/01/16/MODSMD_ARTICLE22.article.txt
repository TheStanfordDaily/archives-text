FINAL CHAPTER
The final chapter of the story of
the Farm's track upheaval of the
past five days was written last night
when The Daily received the an
nouncement that Jeffrey, Indian
track hero, had been promoted from
his former position as assistant
freshman track coach.
Jeffrey, co-holder of the official
world record 100-yard dash mark of
9.4 seconds, and member of the
record-breaking mile relay team
last year, will start his new duties
immediately. The appointment will
last through the school year and will
mean that he will spend most' of
his time working with the freshman
team.

The appointment, while coming as
a surprise, met with universal ap

Johnson, under whom Jeffrey will
work, expressed great delight.
"I think Jeff has the personality

leadership we are looking for. I'm
pleased to have a fine young fellow
like Jeff as my associate," he said.
"That's wonderful. That's swell.
Jeff has the personality needed for
the job and I think that he will make
a wonderful track coach," said Bill
Ellington, recently ousted assistant
whom Jeffrey will replace.

said last night.

record mark of 3:10.5s for the mile
