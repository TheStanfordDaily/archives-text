Secretary of State Cordell Hull and
Treasury Secretary Henry Morgen

terms today that Great Britain
faces a financial dilemma which
only President Roosevelt's loan
lease bill can prevent and that the
United States may be drawn into the
European war regardless of the
course it pursues.
Both appeared before the House
Foreign Affairs Committee in sup
port of the far-reaching British aid
bill. Secretary of War Henry L.
Stimson will testify tomorrow.
Morgenthau submitted a balance
.sheet of British finances showing
that Britain will be able to pay cash
this year for some $3,000,000 in war
materials ordered from this country,
hut he said that "when it comes to
finding the dollars to pay for any
thing like what they may need, they
just haven't got it."
