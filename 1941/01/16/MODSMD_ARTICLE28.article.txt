# Former Professor Tells Of Stanford in Last War
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
College students these days are in
a dither.
And among their worries is just
what it's going to be like around
here if the United States again feels
impelled to join the rather lethal
game of follow-the-leader popular
among the nations at present.
Since there seems to be a dearth
of seers on the Farm, the anxious
student's next best source of infor
mation is Dr. C. A. Duniway's "War
History of Stanford," available in
the library. At present the book,
awaiting publication, is only a col
lection of typewritten yellow sheets
in a battered manila envelope.
HECTIC WAR LIFE
But, despite its non-glamorous
appearance, it can be gathered that
life at Stanford during World
War II (if and when) is going to be
pretty hectic, if the past is any in
dication.
Dr. Duniway, who taught at Stan
ford before the war, took the presi
dency of the University of Colorado.
Since his retirement four years ago
he has been living here on the
campus. He began work on "War
History of Stanford" a year ago this

month.
Perhaps the major difference be
tween the previous pre-war period
and the present state of National
Emergency was the news. According
to Dr. Duniway, the "Daily Palo
Alto," now the "Daily," ran a col
umn of war news for about five
months in 1914. After that time, un
til 1917, war news in the "Dippy"
was confined to "an occasional in
terview, or lecture or letter."
CHARITIES SUPPORT
Stanford men, other than the na
tionals of belligerent nations who
naturally returned to Europe im
mediately, confined themselves to
organizing ambulance units, and the
school as a whole turned out whole
heartedly for the various charitiesâ€”
particularly Herbert Hoover's Bel
gian relief.
The predominant tone of the
school after war was declaimed was
one of hysterical activity. Telling in
chronological order, the faculty and
student enlistments, the work of the
older men in defense, and academic
adjustments, Dr. Dunaway's book
presents an interesting picture of
Stanford in arms.
