# El Campo Rescues Lost Bell
## 
### 
For whom does the Campo bell
toll? Up until yesterday it looked
like a toss-up between President
Wilbur and the Corp Yard.
But El Campo's huge "900-pound"
bell which was mysteriously found
Monday on Dr. Wilbur's front door
step is now back in its place on the
Campo dining table.
According to members of the eat
ing club they don't have the slight
est idea as to who did the dirty
work. The Daily, however, discov
ered yesterday that some of the boys
from Toro were responsible.
Monday afternoon The Daily re
ceived a telephone call from an un
known "someone" reporting the in
cident. Next day several Campo
members went to the Wilbur res-

idence only to find that the bell had
already been removed.
It next turned up at the Corp
Yard, where workmen were keeping
it in storage until the Campos got
wise. From there it was finally re
turned yesterday by a rescue squad
from the club.
A postcard, received yesterday by
The Daily, and signed "The Perpe
trators" reported that "the bell felt
like 900 pounds, but only weighs
450."
