# 'Bartered Bride' Need Choristers
## 
### 
More voices are needed for the
chorus of "The Bartered Bride,"
Joel Carter announced today. There
is need especially for tenors and
basses. All who are interested are
requested to see either Mr. Carter
or Dr. Poppper at the choir room on
Monday, Wednesday, or Friday af
ternoons between 1 and 5:30 o'clock
or to attend a chorus rehearsal on
Monday night at 7:30 o'clock at the
Little Theater.
The chorus will take part in five
numbers, and because of the early
rehearsal schedules, singers may
expect few last-minute rehearsals!
Students are urged to try out as
there are still a few leading roles
open.
