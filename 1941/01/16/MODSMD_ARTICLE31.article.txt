ATHENS, Jan. 15 (UP). â€”Greek
troops smashing forward through a
terrific snowstorm have captured
new Italian positions in Albania
after fierce fighting, a government
source reported tonight.

The spokesman said the Italians
were resisting desperately, to gain
time for labor battalions fortifying
fresh lines and strengthening de
fenses of Valona.
