# Stanford Cage Team Set For Highly-Touted Troy
## 
### 
When the Indians take the court against Sam Barry's Trojans in the
Pavilion tomorrow night, they will face one of the strongest teams they
will have to meet during the season.
For no matter how poor his material is reported to he before the begin
ning of the season, Sam Barry, S.C. cage mentor, always manages to turn

out an exceedingly good ball
This season the Trojans weren't sup
posed to be too sharp, mainly be
cause they lost four men from last
season's top quintet through gradua
tion. Only Jack Lippert remains.
But from a number of subs who
saw quite a bit of action last season,
Barry has molded an outfit that is
really ready to defend the crown
U.S.C. won in the Southern Division
of the Pacific Coast Conference a
year ago.
With Lippert/as its main cog, the
S.C. machine has played lots of good
ball so far this season, hanging up a
SG-35 victory over U.C.L.A., their
cross-town rivals, last Friday night.
On the weight of his performance
against the Bruins, Lippert went into
the lead in the Conference scoring
column. This, however, is a rather
hollow honor in view of the fact that
neither Stanford nor California has
played a Conference game yet.

The other Trojan hot-shot is Bob
Ormsby, a forward, who is an ex
ceptionally good shot. Ormsby has
been assigned to fill the spot left by
the graduation of Ralph Vaughn,
last year's Trojan star. The remain
der of the S.C. first team, Len Berg,
Joe Reising, and Johnny Luber, are
not exceptionally brilliant cagers,
although they are better than aver
age.
Yesterday afternoon Coach Ever
ett Dean sent his Indians through a
fast workout, featuring defense in a
scrimmage against the Trojan of
fense as emulated by the reserves.
Stanford tied up the reserves some
thing fierce in the scrimmage, but
it is not to be expected that they will
find the going as easy tomorrow and
Saturday nights.
Both Donnie Williams and Fordy
Anderson rang up a number of field
goals in yesterday's scrimmage on a
series of fast breaks, a part of the
Indian offense which, by the way,
hasn't been very effective in the
last few games. By dint of plenty of
work on this phase of the game, how
ever, Dean expects his charges to
tank more than a few points on fast
breaks this week-end.
Lanky Bob Penn, who starred for
Stanford in the U.S.F. game, will be
an important addition to the string
of subs Dean can run into the con
test if necessary. Because much of
his time has been taken up by a
flying course he has been taking,
Penn hasn't had very much oppor
tunity to practice up until a week
or so ago. But now that he can work
out regularly with the team, Penn is
likely to see quite a bit of action,
for as he showed in the U.S.F. game,
he is a valuable man, especially on
offensive rebounds where his 6 feet
s'L> inches come in handy.
