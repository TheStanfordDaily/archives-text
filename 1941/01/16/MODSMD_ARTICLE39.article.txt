"EVIDENTLY crew is not going to
return to Stanford, at least not
in the role it played on the Farm 20
years ago. The day will probably
never come when' a Cardinal eight
will row on the Hudson in the
Poughkeepsie Regatta.
Rowing as a sport may remain at
Stanford in the same status that it
now holds, but even a major miracle
won't get the present Boat Club into
intercollegiate competition of any
importance.
The movement has come a long
wpy since the rebirth of crew was
hailed in The Daily last year.
There is an organized group of
! oarsmen now, and they have ac
| cumulated a good deal of equip
ment practically on a shoe-string.
Starting from scratch last year
they now have a place to row and
a shell to row in. Men in the ac
tivity now get gym credit for the
time spent on the water.

I there's one factor that is go
| ing to keep crew from develop
ing into anything but a "sport for
sport's sake" affair here. That fac
tor is money.
Estimates as to the cost of sup
porting rowing vary according to the
source. A1 Masters places the figure
at $50,000 a year. That sum, he says,
includes only operating expenses,
does not take into consideration the
initial investment.
A man who has been closely con
nected with athletics here at Stan
ford for some years quoted a $75,000
a year figure, evidently including
the cost of installing an adequate
plant.
A man connected with the Boat
Club here at Stanford says that
crew can be run here on an inter
collegiate, but probably not a big
time, basis for a cost of $2,000 per
year.
Those are the extremes, on the
record of actual figures, all these es
itmates are a good deal off. Cornell,
one of the biggest rowing schools in
the East, budgets roughly $20,000 a
year for crew. The Big Red nat
urally have one important saving,
they do not need to make a trans
continental trip to compete at Pough
keepsie.
California, which does have to
make this journey, spends around
$30,000 a year on crew, according to
fairly reliable figures.

In view of the decline in atli
lctic revenue over the last ten
years, a proven statistical fact,
Stanford could not afford to spend
a sum near this size.
Unfortunately crew is the only
I sport of anywhere near major pro
portions which does not bring any
revenue at all. No sport but football
even comes close to paying its own
way, yet all other sports contribute
I at least a small sum to their own
support.
The "no funds" answer to the oft
recurring question of bleachers for
Angell Field in past years demon
strates the condition of athletic
finances. Money for athletic pur
poses is spread thinly enough ngw
without adding another large debit
to the fiscal balance sheet.
Crewmen Avill point out that
rowing has not cost the school a
ccnt so far. That is correct. But it
is to their own best interest that
they realize that at no time in the
future may they expect financial
help from the B.A.C. They must
also realize that without such help
crew will never achieve an im
portant position on the Farm.
Harry Maloney, always a backer
of minor sports and a supporter of
rowing says that the shell game can
never reach an important intercol
legiate level here.
Any di-eams that the rowing en
thusiasts may have of competing
with California and Washington on
the water, no matter how far in
the future, must remain just dreams.
