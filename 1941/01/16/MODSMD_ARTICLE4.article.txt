WASHINGTON, Jan. 15 (UP). —The Navy Department has launched an
all-out effort to speed construction of a two-ocean fleet, Secretary Frank
Knox revealed today.
He said most of the nation's Navy yards have gone on a six-day, 48-
hour week and some have started on a three-shift system that is being
4 1 ~ :Jl_. :LI

extended ' as rapidly as possible
virtually all yards. He added in
some instances yards may work two
10-hour shifts to permit overhaul
ing of machinery, but in all cases
workers are paid overtime for work
in excess _ of 40 hours—the basic
work week.
TOP SPEED NEEDED
Knox emphasized everything pos
sible is being done to speed con
struction.
Rear Admiral Samuel M. Robin
son, chief of the Navy's Bureau of
Ships, told the House Naval Affairs
Committee the shipbuilding program
has been stepped up to a pace that
will see 151 destroyers turned out in
the next three years instead of the
scheduled 100.
The committee swiftly approved a
bill authorizing a $300,000,000 ex
penditure for better fleet antiaircraft
defenses.
ESCORT VESSELS
It then heard a request for im
mediate authority and funds to build
280 "urgently needed" submarine
chasers, minesweepers and motor
torpedo boats capable of operating
with the fleet or as escort vessels
anywhere.
The committee did not take final
action on the Navy's request for
$315,000,000 for shipbuilding and
$194,000,000 for ordnance.
Rear Admiral W. R. Furlong of
the Navy's Ordnance Bureau told
the committee among the reasons
additional facilities were needed
were:
1. British pleas for more guns to
arm their merchant ships.
2. The U. S. Navy's desire to have
an ample supply of guns to arm
1,816 American merchant ships im
mediately if this country should en
ter the war.
Robinson revealed that by 1946
United States naval power, including
combat vessels, sweepers, and aux
iliaries, would total 1,898 craft. He
said the Navy now has 782 ships, in
cluding 322 major combat vessels.
