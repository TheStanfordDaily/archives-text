# Farm Swim Stars to Bid For Crown
## 
### 
Stanford's powerful swimming
team has an excellent chance of re
gaining the Conference champion
ship last held by the Cards in 1938.
Stanford held the title from 1918
until 1933 inclusive, and lost it to
U.S.C. from then until 1936. Stan
ford won again in 1937 and 1938 and
the Trojans again took the title for
the last two years.
The Indians are potentially pow
erful in every event with half a
dozen stars returning along with a
lot of lesser lights from last year's
team. Led by Co-Captains Roy
Vitousek and Bill Weeden, the
Cards have announced that they are
definitely after the title, according
to Coach Nort Thornton.
WEEDEN OUT
Vitousek, 1940 Conference breast
stroke champion and record holder,
should prove to be the coast's
greatest and most Versatile swim
mer this year. He will compete in
the 100-yard free-style event and
is expected to gain national recogni
tion. Weeden, 1939 Conference
champion in the backstroke and
second-place winner in 1940, was
stricken with appendicitis on New
Year's Eve and will be lost to the
squad for at least six weeks, but he
will probably be available when the
big meets roll around.
In the diving events the Cards
point to Howard Adams, 1940 cham
pion, and Bill Niccolls, third-place
winner in last year's conference
meet. The largest group of sprinters
ever to compete under the Cardi
nal banner includes Vitousek, Young,
Regnolds, Miller, McKillop, Walz,
Stelle, Dillon, and Vanina.
BACKSTROKERS GOOD
The middle distances will be ably
taken care of by a quartet of fine
prospects including Don Smith, A1
Frost, Hays Busch and Bob Jones.
There are three outstanding back
stroke candidates in Bill Weeden,
"Doc" Colyear, and Jim Canning.
Colyear was the ace of last year's
frosh, while Canning placed fourth
in the conference.
The breaststroke will have Vitou
sek, Meyer, Pain, and Harris. Scott
Dudley, holder of the nation's frosh
record in this event, will improve
the Indians' chances in this event.
The interclass swimming meet be
tween members of the squad will be
held Saturday, January 25, at 2
o'clock. This opens the season for
the varsity, which will have at least
one meet a week from then on until
April 26, except during finals and
spring vacation.

team has an excellent chance of re
gaining the Conference champion
ship last held by the Cards in 1938.
Stanford held the title from 1918
until 1933 inclusive, and lost it to
U.S.C. from then until 1936. Stan
ford won again in 1937 and 1938 and
the Trojans again took the title for
the last two years.
The Indians are potentially pow
erful in every event with half a
dozen stars returning along with a
lot of lesser lights from last year's
team. Led by Co-Captains Roy
Vitousek and Bill Weeden, the
Cards have announced that they are
definitely after the title, according
to Coach Nort Thornton.
WEEDEN OUT
Vitousek, 1940 Conference breast
stroke champion and record holder,
should prove to be the coast's
greatest and most Versatile swim
mer this year. He will compete in
the 100-yard free-style event and
is expected to gain national recogni
tion. Weeden, 1939 Conference
champion in the backstroke and
second-place winner in 1940, was
stricken with appendicitis on New
Year's Eve and will be lost to the
squad for at least six weeks, but he
will probably be available when the
big meets roll around.
In the diving events the Cards
point to Howard Adams, 1940 cham
pion, and Bill Niccolls, third-place
winner in last year's conference
meet. The largest group of sprinters
ever to compete under the Cardi
nal banner includes Vitousek, Young,
Regnolds, Miller, McKillop, Walz,
Stelle, Dillon, and Vanina.
BACKSTROKERS GOOD
The middle distances will be ably
taken care of by a quartet of fine
prospects including Don Smith, A1
Frost, Hays Busch and Bob Jones.
There are three outstanding back
stroke candidates in Bill Weeden,
"Doc" Colyear, and Jim Canning.
Colyear was the ace of last year's
frosh, while Canning placed fourth
in the conference.
The breaststroke will have Vitou
sek, Meyer, Pain, and Harris. Scott
Dudley, holder of the nation's frosh
record in this event, will improve
the Indians' chances in this event.
The interclass swimming meet be
tween members of the squad will be
held Saturday, January 25, at 2
o'clock. This opens the season for
the varsity, which will have at least
one meet a week from then on until
April 26, except during finals and
spring vacation.
