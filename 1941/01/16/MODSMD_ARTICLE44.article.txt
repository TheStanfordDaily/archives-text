# Papoose Cagers To Meet Jaysee
## 
### 
Stanford's frosh quintet goes up
against the toughest Jaysee outfit
in the Northern California J. C. loop
when it tackles San Mateo tomor
row night in the Pavilion at 6:30
o'clock.
Experts are sitting up nights try
ing to figure out ways of stopping
the Jaysee's Cortez, flashy forward,
who set a new prep record when he
scored 33 points against Modesto J.C.
in tournament competition.
Coach Beeb Lee is counting on his
two skyscrapers, Jim Pollard and
Bob Wreisner, to hold down the ef
forts of Cortez to a minimum. On
the whole, the Bulldog squad has
the disadvantage in average height,
and it may prove their undoing.
Monday eve against Palo Alto
High, the freshmen hit the hoop
for a 38 per cent average in the
first half and a 41 per cent mark in
the second. Lee's unit system of
substituting turned out pretty well
against the high school outfit, and
the frosh mentor may use it again
Friday.
