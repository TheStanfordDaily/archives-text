# For Frosh Only

### 
THE freshmen have consumed just about all
the free meals they'll be offered.
And the brothers are sitting around upstairs
puzzling over that fourteenth "final" list. In
Encina the consumption of electricity has almost
reached its peak and each wide, bare, imper
sonal corridor echoes the hum of voices. The
Class of '44 is in the process of making up its
mind.
As this jaded senior recalls, those were hectic
days. Intervening years have not, we imagine,
changed things much. Tomorrow afternoon for
mal pledging will end the weeks of rushing,
the hours of indecision and suspense. And both
Encina and Stanford's 24 fraternities will breathe
an expressive sigh of relief.
But you—you freshman up there in that third
floor bull-pen room — don't worry too much
about this business. Those text-books look a
little dusty. You probably haven't touched
them since you brought them home from the
Bookstore. You and your roommate can't quite
make up your minds which house it'll be—or
whether it might not be better to move across
the street to Toyon. Don't worry, though. This
is just a once-a-year show. It'll be over about
2:30 Saturday morning.
Because, you see, after this annual January
performance is finished, that Hall-Row dividing
line that looms like the Rocky Mountains now
will shrink to its proper size. Basically the
choice which faces Encinamen this week is one
which centers about living group alone. It is a
decision as to whether or not a man shall live
in a small, compact, closely knit organization
or whether he will live in a larger, more demo
cratic, less select group.
It is possible for a man to be happy or un
happy in either environment. Each offers ad
vantages and each possesses obvious draw
backs. But once your choice is made, don't
worry about its outcome. Stanford as a whole
will still remain the same. And, as soon as the
tension of these last few days has disappeared,
Stanford will forget about that mythical Hall-
Row split. You see, Stanford is still small
enough a school to consider itself a unit. And
it won't make much difference whether you live
on Lasuen or Arguello.
Not too many seasons from now January 1941
will seem a little remote, in sharp focus, without
shadow—and perhaps worth a laugh.
