# Bellwether on the Beam

in!" I yelled.
v—' The door whisked open and in floated
Bellwether like a weather-beaten clipper ship
under full sail. "Laddie," he boomed, leaning
against the atrocity my roommate fondly calls
a dresser and parking one foot in the best chair.
"Good to see you."
"Well, if it isn't Bellwether!" I beamed, mov
ing the chair out of range. "Given you up for
lost. Where've you been, boy?"
Bellwether blushed. "A bad case of judg
ment, laddie. Walked into the hospital Reg
day to visit a sick friend and they wouldn't let
me out till now. Regulations and that sort of
thing, you know."
I slipped the pack of smokes into the desk
drawer. "Well, Emery, must have kept you out
of things a bit, eh?"
The drawer hadn't shut fast enough. Through
the smoke of his newly lit cigarette Bellwether
frowned severely. "Did a bit, boy. Sorry about
it. Things seem to have slipped up since I've
been gone."
"We did the best we could, Emery." I was
a bit disgruntled. "What's the deal?"
The Sage pulled the ch'air back again and
grimaced at the roommate's dresser. "This
rain," he nodded. "Something must be done
about it."
It sounded as if the bee in the Bellwether
bonnet had been out taking a quickie. "Doesn't
make sense, Emery. Can't do anything about
the rain."
The Great Man waggled his foot reprovingly,
to the detriment of the chair. "Don't be silly,
laddie. I'm talking about the parking conglom
eration the rain has left here on campus."
I couldn't resist it. "What happened, Bell
wether—step in some of that knee-deep mud by
the libe lot?"
"Ridiculous," snapped the Sage. "Besides I
didn't see it."
I grinned.
"No laughing matter," Bellwether muttered.
"Besides, we may lose some of our smaller
frosh entirely some day."
I nodded. "Gotta admit you're right, Emery.
Still, what do do? Can't do much now, can we?"
"Why not? We can take down the fence be-

cars a place to park."
I was amazed. "Bellwether, why didn't I think

of that?"
The Sage thumped a deprecating forefinger
on a soggy knee. "Nothing to it, boy. Just live
a clean life. I'd best be going now. Maybe
some of the boys will want to help tear down
that fence."
"Bye, Emery. Keep out of the puddles."
"Hi-ho, laddie." One look back as he left
the room. "Get rid of that dresser, son. It ain't
healthy."—W. C.

of that?"
The Sage thumped a deprecating forefinger
on a soggy knee. "Nothing to it, boy. Just live
a clean life. I'd best be going now. Maybe
some of the boys will want to help tear down
that fence."

v—' The door whisked open and in floated
Bellwether like a weather-beaten clipper ship
under full sail. "Laddie," he boomed, leaning
against the atrocity my roommate fondly calls
a dresser and parking one foot in the best chair.
"Good to see you."
"Well, if it isn't Bellwether!" I beamed, mov
ing the chair out of range. "Given you up for
lost. Where've you been, boy?"
Bellwether blushed. "A bad case of judg
ment, laddie. Walked into the hospital Reg
day to visit a sick friend and they wouldn't let
me out till now. Regulations and that sort of
thing, you know."
I slipped the pack of smokes into the desk
drawer. "Well, Emery, must have kept you out
of things a bit, eh?"
The drawer hadn't shut fast enough. Through
the smoke of his newly lit cigarette Bellwether
frowned severely. "Did a bit, boy. Sorry about
it. Things seem to have slipped up since I've
been gone."
"We did the best we could, Emery." I was
a bit disgruntled. "What's the deal?"
The Sage pulled the ch'air back again and
grimaced at the roommate's dresser. "This
rain," he nodded. "Something must be done
about it."
It sounded as if the bee in the Bellwether
bonnet had been out taking a quickie. "Doesn't
make sense, Emery. Can't do anything about
the rain."
The Great Man waggled his foot reprovingly,
to the detriment of the chair. "Don't be silly,
laddie. I'm talking about the parking conglom
eration the rain has left here on campus."
I couldn't resist it. "What happened, Bell
wether—step in some of that knee-deep mud by
the libe lot?"
"Ridiculous," snapped the Sage. "Besides I
didn't see it."
I grinned.
"No laughing matter," Bellwether muttered.
"Besides, we may lose some of our smaller
frosh entirely some day."
I nodded. "Gotta admit you're right, Emery.
Still, what do do? Can't do much now, can we?"
"Why not? We can take down the fence be-
