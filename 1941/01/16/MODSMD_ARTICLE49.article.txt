# BULL SESSION

### BUD AMES 
following paragraphs are verbatim bits from a
letter which has just come from war-torn England.
This is in all seriousness. Read what this Englander
says, how he verbalizes beautifully and directly the
horrors of war over London. Its simple directness will
shiver you.
This is no press report; this is what is actually
happening.

"On the day of the declaration of war by Cham
berlain . . . there was an air raid warning. I went
downstairs and watched some people hurry by, with
their gas masks, toward the primitive shelters under
some of the buildings and then as nothing happened
and the all-clear went they came back in the dusk
to their homes.
". . . Still no raids except a few warnings to
which no one paid any attention. The war went on
and France lost and the air warnings came more often.
I served from almost the first on the telephones of my
post. (Note: the writer is over 60 years old.)
"... Then the big raids came and bombs l'ained
down at night and at first there was little we could
do about it but sit and hope the damage wouldn't be
too great. The regular and the auxiliary fire depart
ments were wonderful; the police and special police
were wonderful, never shirking extra duty or dangers
and many have been killed.
"... But they (his employees) got there by one
route or another and did their work and got back
home—when they lost their homes they took a day off
and saved what they could and got another place to
live, or fixed up part of their own ruined house and
went back there to live. . . . The common people are
winning this war.
"... One night when I was on duty at the tele
phones a message came through from headquarters
that fire bombs not making much noise had been
dropped in the dark. The wardens volunteer. Re
member, most of them, if not all, older than me and
I'm over 60, went out aijd climbed in the dark out
on the roofs over four stories up. They were barristers
and judges and no one of them had done harder work
than an occasional round of golf for 40 years. And
these same men or others like them were and are
doing the same sort of thing night after night all over
London and England. Wonderful, I call it.
one night a bomb dropped in the road di
rectly in front of the place I was sleeping and
smashed the building over where I was and when I
woke they were digging me out.
"... So we went on, the by now familiar drone
of the planes, the gun fire of the barrage, the rattling
down of bits of shell and shrapnell—some big enough
to put a hole in the roof—punctuated by the thud and
crash of bombs or the whistle of them through the air
and the guessing as to whether the next from that
plane would be nearer or further off, all to be lit up
by fires nearer or further off as the noise died down
and we had a chance to look outside sometimes to
see flares let down on parachutes so that the enemy
could see better what to do in the way of aiming.
". . .In our place, glasses that we had left on
the table the night before had been broken straight
off and an old fashioned cruet with the oil and vine
gar and oil bottles in it stood in its place, but all the
stoppers had been taken out by the vacuum created
by the explosion, the clock was running and hardly
anything was hurt in back of the flat.
"... I stood at the door of the shelter until
Beecher (his son) came, as I knew he would if he
were alive, and as I heard him calling as he climbed
over the pile of masonry and roof and floor timbers
higher than a full story, I was glad that he was alive,
too."

A LETTER FROM LONDON
following paragraphs are verbatim bits from a
letter which has just come from war-torn England.
This is in all seriousness. Read what this Englander
says, how he verbalizes beautifully and directly the
horrors of war over London. Its simple directness will
shiver you.
This is no press report; this is what is actually
happening.

"On the day of the declaration of war by Cham
berlain . . . there was an air raid warning. I went
downstairs and watched some people hurry by, with
their gas masks, toward the primitive shelters under
some of the buildings and then as nothing happened
and the all-clear went they came back in the dusk
to their homes.
". . . Still no raids except a few warnings to
which no one paid any attention. The war went on
and France lost and the air warnings came more often.
I served from almost the first on the telephones of my
post. (Note: the writer is over 60 years old.)
"... Then the big raids came and bombs l'ained
down at night and at first there was little we could
do about it but sit and hope the damage wouldn't be
too great. The regular and the auxiliary fire depart
ments were wonderful; the police and special police
were wonderful, never shirking extra duty or dangers
and many have been killed.
"... But they (his employees) got there by one
route or another and did their work and got back
home—when they lost their homes they took a day off
and saved what they could and got another place to
live, or fixed up part of their own ruined house and
went back there to live. . . . The common people are
winning this war.
"... One night when I was on duty at the tele
phones a message came through from headquarters
that fire bombs not making much noise had been
dropped in the dark. The wardens volunteer. Re
member, most of them, if not all, older than me and
I'm over 60, went out aijd climbed in the dark out
on the roofs over four stories up. They were barristers
and judges and no one of them had done harder work
than an occasional round of golf for 40 years. And
these same men or others like them were and are
doing the same sort of thing night after night all over
London and England. Wonderful, I call it.
one night a bomb dropped in the road di
rectly in front of the place I was sleeping and
smashed the building over where I was and when I
woke they were digging me out.
"... So we went on, the by now familiar drone
of the planes, the gun fire of the barrage, the rattling
down of bits of shell and shrapnell—some big enough
to put a hole in the roof—punctuated by the thud and

route or another and did their work and got back
home—when they lost their homes they took a day off
and saved what they could and got another place to
live, or fixed up part of their own ruined house and
went back there to live. . . . The common people are
winning this war.
"... One night when I was on duty at the tele
phones a message came through from headquarters
that fire bombs not making much noise had been
dropped in the dark. The wardens volunteer. Re
member, most of them, if not all, older than me and
I'm over 60, went out aijd climbed in the dark out
on the roofs over four stories up. They were barristers
and judges and no one of them had done harder work
than an occasional round of golf for 40 years. And
these same men or others like them were and are
doing the same sort of thing night after night all over
London and England. Wonderful, I call it.
one night a bomb dropped in the road di
rectly in front of the place I was sleeping and
smashed the building over where I was and when I
woke they were digging me out.
"... So we went on, the by now familiar drone
of the planes, the gun fire of the barrage, the rattling
down of bits of shell and shrapnell—some big enough
to put a hole in the roof—punctuated by the thud and
crash of bombs or the whistle of them through the air
and the guessing as to whether the next from that
plane would be nearer or further off, all to be lit up
by fires nearer or further off as the noise died down
and we had a chance to look outside sometimes to
see flares let down on parachutes so that the enemy
could see better what to do in the way of aiming.
". . .In our place, glasses that we had left on
the table the night before had been broken straight
off and an old fashioned cruet with the oil and vine
gar and oil bottles in it stood in its place, but all the
stoppers had been taken out by the vacuum created
by the explosion, the clock was running and hardly
anything was hurt in back of the flat.
"... I stood at the door of the shelter until
Beecher (his son) came, as I knew he would if he
were alive, and as I heard him calling as he climbed
over the pile of masonry and roof and floor timbers
higher than a full story, I was glad that he was alive,
too."
