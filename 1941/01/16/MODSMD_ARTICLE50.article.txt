RELIGION AND DEMOCRACY

EDITOR, SIR:
President Wilbur's message printed in the Rose
Bowl program proclaims to the world that "In the
coming year, educators and scholars, men of science
and the professions, and leaders of industry and gov
ernment will come from throughout the nation to
Stanford University, to demonstrate and reaffirm the
position of this University ... as an institution . . .
devoted to the preservation of free men and a free
society."
Certainly this program is a logical one for Stan
ford to follow.
But does it?
Today the United States, where men are still free,
is in grave danger, both from within and without.
One of America's chief lines of defense against this
two-fold threat is the preservation of the religious
fervor, the spiritual zeal, and the patriotic love of
country of its people, especially its youth; for if these
feelings were erased, there would be little left for
which to fight.
Yet, what do we find going on here at Stanford?
Let us examine, merely as an example, the RE
QUIRED freshman course, the History of Western
Civilization.
In this course deliberate attempts are made to be
little and break down religions, including Christian
ity, the religion of the majority of Stanfordites. We
are told that many of its beliefs are ridiculous; we are
told that religious zeal is silly for educated and
thoughtful persons; we who fervently believe in a
spiritual Christianity are laughed at; we are classed
as suckers if we believe much that is printed in
the Bible.
On the other hand, many of the "brilliant" profes
sors sneer at democracies, extol dictatorships in flow
ing and colorful terms. In addition many uncalled-for
remarks are made in the classrooms and sections,
remarks that are needless, suggestive, and often abso
lutely filthy. The morals of the students who hear
these remarks will sometimes tend to decay, slowly,
but surely.
These tactics are the same as those used by fifth
columnists and traitors. They, too, attempt to under
mine the religions, the patriotism, and the morals of
the people whose country they seek to wreck and ruin.
Why are such conditions tolerated at Stanford Uni
versity, "an institution . . . devoted to the preserva
tion of free men and a free society"?

EDITOR, SIR:
President Wilbur's message printed in the Rose
Bowl program proclaims to the world that "In the
coming year, educators and scholars, men of science
and the professions, and leaders of industry and gov
ernment will come from throughout the nation to
Stanford University, to demonstrate and reaffirm the
position of this University ... as an institution . . .
devoted to the preservation of free men and a free
society."
Certainly this program is a logical one for Stan
ford to follow.
But does it?
Today the United States, where men are still free,
is in grave danger, both from within and without.
One of America's chief lines of defense against this
two-fold threat is the preservation of the religious
fervor, the spiritual zeal, and the patriotic love of
country of its people, especially its youth; for if these
feelings were erased, there would be little left for
which to fight.
Yet, what do we find going on here at Stanford?
Let us examine, merely as an example, the RE
QUIRED freshman course, the History of Western
Civilization.
In this course deliberate attempts are made to be
little and break down religions, including Christian
ity, the religion of the majority of Stanfordites. We
are told that many of its beliefs are ridiculous; we are
told that religious zeal is silly for educated and
thoughtful persons; we who fervently believe in a
spiritual Christianity are laughed at; we are classed
as suckers if we believe much that is printed in
the Bible.
On the other hand, many of the "brilliant" profes
sors sneer at democracies, extol dictatorships in flow
ing and colorful terms. In addition many uncalled-for
remarks are made in the classrooms and sections,
remarks that are needless, suggestive, and often abso
lutely filthy. The morals of the students who hear
these remarks will sometimes tend to decay, slowly,
but surely.
These tactics are the same as those used by fifth
columnists and traitors. They, too, attempt to under
mine the religions, the patriotism, and the morals of
the people whose country they seek to wreck and ruin.
Why are such conditions tolerated at Stanford Uni
versity, "an institution . . . devoted to the preserva
tion of free men and a free society"?
