"NO, NO, NANETTE,'' now play
ing at the Stanford Theater.
The title, "No, No, Nanette" of
course brings up associations in one's
mind of the great Broadway musical
comedy success of 15 years or so
ago, of "Tea for Two," "I Want to
Be Happy," and other favorite tunes
that we still hear, or of the techni
color movie of the play that was
made 10 or 12 years ago.
The musical score has been prac
tically dropped from this latest re
vival and for obvious reasons. There
isn't anyone in the cast who can
sing, so, according to Hollywood
formula, the play is made to fit the
cast, though I do believe I remem
ber the themes of the music being
played in the background while
Anna Neagle spoke the lyrics.
As comedy, however, the embar
rassing situations in the plot never
fail to produce hilarity in the audi
ence. Anna Neagle as Nanette is the
big name attraction of the film but
she had better stick to being Queen
Victoria.
Roland Young as the uncle who
is too weak or dumb to say "No"
fills the role with his usual capabil
ity; Richard Carlson is more ro
mantic than ever in the role of the
dreamy artist; and Victor Mature
gets further build-up in the recently
started campaign to make him the
he-man, Clark Gable type.
Eve Arden as Kitty from Kansas
with a French accent tickles every
one in the cast coyly with her
feather muff, Helen Broderick plays
the unsuspecting wife, and, inevi
tably, Zasu plays the part of the
maid.—Adams
