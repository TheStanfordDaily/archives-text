# Franz Hohenlohe Rejoins Mother
## 
### 
Prince Franz Hohenlohe, former
Stanford graduate student, last night
rejoined his mother, Princess Stef
anie, who faces deportation for over
staying a passport extension, at the
Casa Real apartment at which the
Hungarian noblewoman has been
staying in Palo Alto.
"I am in favor of her leaving the
country as soon as possible," the
Prince said. 'She would be happier
living with grandfather in Hungary
and I will try to convince her of
that, but it probably won't do any
good."
The Princess has continually in
sisted that she wished to prove her
innocence of charges that she is a
Nazi-sympathizer and that she
wishes to remain in this country.
Her son arrived by plane from New
York.
