JTALY and Germany are becoming
quite concerned about American
aid to Great Britain, and their ef
forts to put an end to our shipments |
ot nations who resist aggression have
ranged all the way from direct sabo
tage in American industry to harm
less propaganda.
One of the strangest pieces of
propaganda yet seen appeared yes
terday in the press of Italy. Ob
viously, it was designed to intimi
date the United States, and con
vince the people here that aid to
Britain is not desirable.
According to the Italian newspa
pers, a secret United States military
report has been seized by Fascist
authorities. The report, they say,
declares that the belief the United
States would be in danger of attack
if Britain should fall is "based on
an erroneous evaluation of the fact
and has no military foundation."
"The United Statsc should not
interfere in European affairs and
should not take a financial inter
est in the war," one Italian news
paper supposedly quotes from the
report. "United States industries
should not furnish war material to
foreign nations."
These quotations are supposed to
be taken from a confidential mili
tary report seized by the Italians.
Certainly the quotations ai*e what the
Italians wish the American people
to believe. And that is about as far
as they go.
One official in Washington sum
med up the significance of the Italian
claims . "Pure propaganda," he said.
"The reports never existed."
It is the old totalitarian propa
ganda technique. Hitler says in
Mein Kampf that the only kind of a
lie that the people will believe is a
big lie. They see through slight ex
aggerations, because they come in
contact with them in every-day life.
But a big, absolutely absurd lie, he
says, the people will believe if it is
repeated often enough.
The Italian claims, of course, have
no basis at all; they are merely
what the Italians wish Americans to
believe.

I N .. testimony given before the
House Foreign Affairs Committee
several days ago, it was disclosed
that British capitalists were still per
mitted to keep their holdings in the
United States while the government
was insisting that Britain could no
longer make cash purchases in this
country.
Meanwhile, the British govern
ment has instituted taxes at home
that make taxes in the United States
seem slight in comparison.
The House Committee did not
learn the extent of British holdings
in the United States, but there were
no denials that such holdings exist.
Conversion of these holdings into
cash to purchase war supplies in the
United States most likely would not
be of tremendous immediate benefit
to the British, for the holdings here
could not pay for even a small part
of the goods that Britain wishes to
secure.
But if the British government
forced holders of these securities
to turn them over in order to es
tablish credit in this country, the
impression created here would he
most favorable.
People might then say that Brit
ain is actually fighting a total war
and is doing her belt to finance pur
chases in this country. If nothing
more .the action would be effective
propaganda on the part of the Brit
ish in stiffling rumors that the
wealthy in Britain are not making
adequate sacrifices.
The return that a few Britains are
getting on these investments in this
country, in the long run, might seem
inconsequential when compared with
the benefits that would accrue from
a more unified and more under
standing attitude of the British sit
uation by the American peopleâ€”an
attitude that could be furthered by
such action.
