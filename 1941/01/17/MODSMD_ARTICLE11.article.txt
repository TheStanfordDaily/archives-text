LONDON, Jan. 16 (UP). —German
dive bombers destroyed the 9,100-
ton British cruiser Southampton in
the all-day battle with a British
naval squadron off Sicily last Fri
day, the Admiralty revealed today.
A fire set by the bombs forced
abandonment of the warship, which
was sunk by the British crew when
they found it impracticable to tow
the vessel to port.
VESSELS REACH PORT
In the battle, which cost German-
Italian forces at least 12 planes and
one destroyer, the 23,000-ton Brit
ish aircraft carrier Illustrious, re
ceived a terrific battering in a
seven-hour attack. The 1335-ton
destroyer Gallant was damaged by
a mine or torpedo.
These two vessels reached port,
although the aircraft carrier received
a direct hit by a 1,000-pound bomb
and "many perforations above and
below the water line" from other
bombs bursting alongside.
UNKNOWN REFUGE
The port where the damaged ships
took refuge was not disclosed, but
probably was Malta or Alexandria,
as the warships were escorting an
important convoy eastward toward
Greece when the attack occurred.
The Admiralty also announced
today the British submarine Pan
dora, 1475 tons, sank two Italian
supply ships, each of about 5,000
tons, southward bound in the cen
tral Mediterranean and probably
en route to Libya.
British airmen were reported to
day to have left the huge Wilhelm
shafen naval base a roaring inferno
after a night long attack.
