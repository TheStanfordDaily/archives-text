# Interfraternity Prom to Honor New Row Men
## 
### 
An expected 300 Stanford men
will conclude the current rushing
season when they officially join the
fraternal bond as pledges of the
Farm's 24 local fraternities this af
ternoon, and will be honored by all
fraternity men and their dates at
tonight's annual Interfraternity
Pledge Prom.
From 3 to 5 o'clock the neophytes
will be pledged by Warren Turner,
Interfraternity auditor, in the A. S.
S. U. committee room, Old Union.
CARDS TO UK TURNED IN
Pledge cards must be turned in to
the A.S.S.U. office by fraternities not
later than 10 o'clock this morning,
as requested by Pete Whittlesey, In
terfraternity president.
Following pledging ceremonies
this afternoon, the respective houses
will host their new pledges at din
ner and attend the S.C. basketball
game, followed by the Prom in the
Women's Gym from 9 to 1 o'clock.
The orchestras of Garwood Van
and Gene Englander will play for
the dancers, who will attend the
yearly affair in semi-formal dress.
PROM TICKETS AVAILABLE
Chairman Bob Prince urges that
fraternities obtain their tickets to
day at the A.S.S.U. office. Each
house must purchase a bid for each
active member and each pledge.
Ducats are $1.25.
Patronesses and patrons will be
Dr. and Mrs. Stan Sharp, Professor
and Mrs. Elmer Fagan, and Mr. and
Mrs. George Kn&les. No special
theme or decorations will be used
for the affair.
Fraternity men will meet their
pledges in front of the Chapel Sun
day morning and each house will
attend the 11 o'clock service in a
body. Dr. D. Elton Trueblood, chap
lain, will deliver a specially pre
pared sermon to conclude pledging
ceremonies with a note of solemnity.
QUOTA OF FOURTEEN
Fourteen freshmen pledges consti
tute a full pledge class in any one
house, and as many transfers and
men of other classes as desired may
be pledged in addition, according to
Whittlesey.
"We know there have undoubt
edly been a few minor violations of
the rushing rules, but there have
been fewer complaints this year
than any year in the past," said
Whittlesey. ''This is true both of
last quarter's Initiation Period and
of rushing. We can't root out all
rush violations at one time, but we
are gradually working toward it."
Rushing for the current season
started early last November with an
open house period, at which all non
fraternity men were welcome to
visit any house without an invita
tion, and included six different pe
riods. Rushees attended preference
dinners on the Row last ni^ht.
