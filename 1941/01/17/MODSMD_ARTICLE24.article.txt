# West Memorial Speaker Discusses Refugee Relief
## 
### 
The worries of the typical Stanford undergraduate are as nothing com
pared to those of Dr. Rufus Jones, who, as chairman of the American
Fviends Service Committee, has assumed a large part of the responsibility
fÂ«.r the welfare of thousands of refugee children in Europe.
I>i\ Jones, professor emeritus of philosophy at Ilaverford College, is at
Stanford to deliver the West Me-a.

ii...rial Lectures next Tuesday, Wed- I
nesday, and Thursday evenings.
The Friends Committee, which is
a Quaker organization, has since the
downfall of France been feeding
over 40,000 children in that area.
"They are pail of the great horde
of refugees from Belgian and north
ern, occupied, France," said Dr.
Jonos, as he sat erect and impec
cable, showing few signs of the in
cessant activity which has filled his
77 years.
TO SEND MERCY SHIPS
"We have been spending about
$100,000, which has been raised
mostly in America. Although here
tofore we have not sent food, but
have simply bought it in Switzer
land, we expecting to be able to
send two mercy ships to France with
food and clothing from America."
Dr. Jones said that this last enter
prise would be conducted in co-op
eration with the Red Cross as a
great many of the Friends Commit
tee efforts also have been.
About the mercy ships, the noted
philosopher said, "We are informed
thai they will be allowed to go
through the English blockade. There
is no danger from the Germans;
they have no fleet down there."
Queried as to the complications of
securing the British okay on such a
project, he remarked, "The British
don't mind making a few excep
tions like that."
AIDED GERMAN JEWS
Author of 45 books, mainly philo
sophic, which have been published
over a period of 40 years, Dr. Jones
has for 20 years occupied his pres
ent position as chairman of the
American Friends Service Com
mittee. In that capacity he sailed
to Germany two years ago to ask
German officials for authorization to
relieve the German Jews.
"Their stores had been wrecked
and they were in general misery. We
did finally get permission to do some
relief work."
This simple admission is perhaps
one of the greatest tributes that
could ever be paid Dr. Jones: that
he successfully plead for mercy with
the Nazi government.
