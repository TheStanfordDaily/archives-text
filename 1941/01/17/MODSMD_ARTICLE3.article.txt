# Stanford Five to Battle Trojan Champs Tonight In Conference Opener
## Indians Challenge Powerful U.S.C. Quintet for Southern Division Lead; Seek Revenge for Former Defeats 
### 
Definitely planning to make their first steps in IJI4I conference basket
ball competition in the right direction, Stanford's highly-regarded cagers
battle the Terrible Trojans from U.9.C. in the Pavilion tonight and to
morrow night at 8 o'clock.
Whether the Indians are really deserving of the rank of favorites to cop

the crown in the Southern
of the Pacific Coast Conference will
in all probability be determined this
week-end. For it is almost a cer
tainty that if Stanford isn't the top
team, U.S.C. is.
And the Trojans, with a team that
has already turned in a conference
win over U.C.L.A., are out to prove
that the latter is the case. Of course,
there is a chance that the teams may
split this week-end's games, the first
half of the four-game series, in
which case little or nothing would be
determined.
GLOOMY SATURDAY?
The chances for an Indian victory
Friday night loom brighter than for
a Saturday night win for two rea
sons: (1) if this Card quintet is any
thing like last year's they will just
play a better game of basketball on
the first night, and (2) Coach Sam
Barry, Trojan cage mentor, always
turns out a rough, hard-to-handle
outfit that takes a lot out of its op
ponent in the first night of a two
game stand.
However, Everett Dean's team this
season may be just smooth enough
to be able to finesse the cagers from
Troy into defeat two nights in a
row.
There is little doubt that Wil
liams, Davidson & Co. are the
smoothest-functioning quintet the
Southern Division has seen in sev
eral years when they are "on their
game." And they have a habit of
being "on their game" when the
chips are down, as they most cer
tainly will be this week-end.
CHOICE OF STYLES
This pair of contests will give the
2(500 hoop fans who will pack the
Pavilion on each Friday and Satur
day night a chance to view two en
tirely different styles of basketball.
They will see a Stanford team that
features tricky ball-handling and
clever footwork, and a U.S.C. quin
tet that relies mostly on aggressive
ness.
In man-power the Cards rate
somewhat of an edge, for while
U.S.C. counts mostly on Guard Jack
Lippert and Forward Bob Ormsby to
hang up points, Stanford has any
number of men who may take high
scoring honors, especially Don Wil
liams, Kenny Davidson, and Fordy
Anderson.
WILLIAMS LOOKS HOT
As shown by the season statistics
printed in yesterday's Daily, Wil
liams is the leading Indian scorer,
having tallied HO field goals and 17
free throws for a total of 137 points
j in nine games played, including the
U.S.F. game in which he played only
I a few minutes. Anderson and Dav
idson are next with 70 and 64 points,
respectively.
Williams will probably be hot to
night; he usually is. The question
seems to be: Will enough other In
dians ring up points to outscore the
Trojans? Last season Kenny Dav
! idson could always be counted on
for buckets at the right time, for he
was the leading guard in the South
ern Division scoring columns. This
year, however, Davidson hasn't
been hitting the hoop with his former
regularity, although he is still one of
the steadiest ball players on the
outfit.
ANDERSON IMPORTANT
Anderson has hot and cold nights.
On some nights he spins them in
from under the bucket and from
outside the keyhole; on other nights
the hoop just seems to have a lid
over it as far as he is concerned. If
the smallish, baby-faced forward
has a sharp eye tonight, it may
mean a victory for the Indians in
their first conference encounter.
Don Burness is potentially the
best center in California. Certainly
he plays the most effortless basket
'ball of any of the pivot men here
abouts. As a point-getter, Burness
was phenomenal in high school, hav
ing established the San Francisco
prep scoring record. And in the
Santa Clara - Stanford game last
week-end he showed promise of be
coming one of the Indians' better
scorers as he finessed the highly
touted Jim Rickert time after time
to ring the gong for 12 points.
COWDEN POINT-GETTER
The other Stanford guard, Bill
Cowden, has never been hailed as a
scoring great, getting credit for his
defensive prowess instead. But
statistics show that he has 60 points
to his credit this season, which rates
him right close to Davidson and
Anderson in the point ratings.
All in all, Coach Everett Dean has
turned out a ball club that definitely
looks like the best in the Southern
Division on paper and on records of
some past performances. Tonight's
and tomorrow night's results will
tell the story in facts.
If Stanford has the stuff to whip
the Trojans two nights in a row, the
Indians will really be the class of
the conference and the logical fa
vorites to represent the Southern
Division in the play-offs for the
championship of the Pacific Coast
Conference in the spring.
STARTING LINE-UP
If it's a split in these first two
games, the battle probably won't be
decided until later in the season.
And if Troy cops a pair, Sam Bar
ry's boys will be odds-on favorites
to cop the title for the second con
secutive year.
So the pressure is really on Dean
and his lads tonight. And most of
the experts in these parts are count
ing on them to come through.

hang up points, Stanford has any
number of men who may take high
scoring honors, especially Don Wil
liams, Kenny Davidson, and Fordy
Anderson.
WILLIAMS LOOKS HOT
As shown by the season statistics
printed in yesterday's Daily, Wil
liams is the leading Indian scorer,
having tallied HO field goals and 17
free throws for a total of 137 points
j in nine games played, including the
U.S.F. game in which he played only
I a few minutes. Anderson and Dav
idson are next with 70 and 64 points,
respectively.
Williams will probably be hot to
night; he usually is. The question
seems to be: Will enough other In
dians ring up points to outscore the
Trojans? Last season Kenny Dav
! idson could always be counted on
for buckets at the right time, for he
was the leading guard in the South
ern Division scoring columns. This
year, however, Davidson hasn't
been hitting the hoop with his former
regularity, although he is still one of
the steadiest ball players on the
outfit.
ANDERSON IMPORTANT
Anderson has hot and cold nights.
On some nights he spins them in
from under the bucket and from
outside the keyhole; on other nights
the hoop just seems to have a lid
over it as far as he is concerned. If
the smallish, baby-faced forward
has a sharp eye tonight, it may
mean a victory for the Indians in
their first conference encounter.
Don Burness is potentially the
best center in California. Certainly
he plays the most effortless basket
'ball of any of the pivot men here
abouts. As a point-getter, Burness
was phenomenal in high school, hav
ing established the San Francisco
prep scoring record. And in the
Santa Clara - Stanford game last
week-end he showed promise of be
coming one of the Indians' better
scorers as he finessed the highly
touted Jim Rickert time after time
to ring the gong for 12 points.
COWDEN POINT-GETTER
The other Stanford guard, Bill
Cowden, has never been hailed as a
scoring great, getting credit for his
defensive prowess instead. But
statistics show that he has 60 points
to his credit this season, which rates
him right close to Davidson and
Anderson in the point ratings.
All in all, Coach Everett Dean has
turned out a ball club that definitely
looks like the best in the Southern
Division on paper and on records of
some past performances. Tonight's
and tomorrow night's results will
tell the story in facts.
If Stanford has the stuff to whip
the Trojans two nights in a row, the
Indians will really be the class of
the conference and the logical fa
vorites to represent the Southern
Division in the play-offs for the
championship of the Pacific Coast
Conference in the spring.
STARTING LINE-UP
If it's a split in these first two
games, the battle probably won't be
decided until later in the season.
And if Troy cops a pair, Sam Bar
ry's boys will be odds-on favorites
to cop the title for the second con
secutive year.
So the pressure is really on Dean
and his lads tonight. And most of
the experts in these parts are count
ing on them to come through.

Definitely planning to make their first steps in IJI4I conference basket
ball competition in the right direction, Stanford's highly-regarded cagers
battle the Terrible Trojans from U.9.C. in the Pavilion tonight and to
morrow night at 8 o'clock.
Whether the Indians are really deserving of the rank of favorites to cop

the crown in the Southern
of the Pacific Coast Conference will
in all probability be determined this
week-end. For it is almost a cer
tainty that if Stanford isn't the top
team, U.S.C. is.
And the Trojans, with a team that
has already turned in a conference
win over U.C.L.A., are out to prove
that the latter is the case. Of course,
there is a chance that the teams may
split this week-end's games, the first
half of the four-game series, in
which case little or nothing would be
determined.
GLOOMY SATURDAY?
The chances for an Indian victory
Friday night loom brighter than for
a Saturday night win for two rea
sons: (1) if this Card quintet is any
thing like last year's they will just
play a better game of basketball on
the first night, and (2) Coach Sam
Barry, Trojan cage mentor, always
turns out a rough, hard-to-handle
outfit that takes a lot out of its op
ponent in the first night of a two
game stand.
However, Everett Dean's team this
season may be just smooth enough
to be able to finesse the cagers from
Troy into defeat two nights in a
row.
There is little doubt that Wil
liams, Davidson & Co. are the
smoothest-functioning quintet the
Southern Division has seen in sev
eral years when they are "on their
game." And they have a habit of
being "on their game" when the
chips are down, as they most cer
tainly will be this week-end.
CHOICE OF STYLES
This pair of contests will give the
2(500 hoop fans who will pack the
Pavilion on each Friday and Satur
day night a chance to view two en
tirely different styles of basketball.
They will see a Stanford team that
features tricky ball-handling and
clever footwork, and a U.S.C. quin
tet that relies mostly on aggressive
ness.
In man-power the Cards rate
somewhat of an edge, for while
U.S.C. counts mostly on Guard Jack

If Stanford has the stuff to whip
the Trojans two nights in a row, the
Indians will really be the class of
the conference and the logical fa
vorites to represent the Southern
Division in the play-offs for the
championship of the Pacific Coast
Conference in the spring.
STARTING LINE-UP
If it's a split in these first two
games, the battle probably won't be
decided until later in the season.
And if Troy cops a pair, Sam Bar
ry's boys will be odds-on favorites
to cop the title for the second con
secutive year.
So the pressure is really on Dean
and his lads tonight. And most of
the experts in these parts are count

Definitely planning to make their first steps in IJI4I conference basket
ball competition in the right direction, Stanford's highly-regarded cagers
battle the Terrible Trojans from U.9.C. in the Pavilion tonight and to
morrow night at 8 o'clock.
Whether the Indians are really deserving of the rank of favorites to cop

the crown in the Southern
of the Pacific Coast Conference will
in all probability be determined this
week-end. For it is almost a cer
tainty that if Stanford isn't the top
team, U.S.C. is.
And the Trojans, with a team that
has already turned in a conference
win over U.C.L.A., are out to prove
that the latter is the case. Of course,
there is a chance that the teams may
split this week-end's games, the first
half of the four-game series, in
which case little or nothing would be
determined.
GLOOMY SATURDAY?
The chances for an Indian victory
Friday night loom brighter than for
a Saturday night win for two rea
sons: (1) if this Card quintet is any
thing like last year's they will just
play a better game of basketball on
the first night, and (2) Coach Sam
Barry, Trojan cage mentor, always
turns out a rough, hard-to-handle
outfit that takes a lot out of its op
ponent in the first night of a two
game stand.
However, Everett Dean's team this
season may be just smooth enough
to be able to finesse the cagers from
Troy into defeat two nights in a
row.
There is little doubt that Wil
liams, Davidson & Co. are the
smoothest-functioning quintet the
Southern Division has seen in sev
eral years when they are "on their
game." And they have a habit of
being "on their game" when the
chips are down, as they most cer
tainly will be this week-end.
CHOICE OF STYLES
This pair of contests will give the
2(500 hoop fans who will pack the
Pavilion on each Friday and Satur
day night a chance to view two en
tirely different styles of basketball.
They will see a Stanford team that
features tricky ball-handling and
clever footwork, and a U.S.C. quin
tet that relies mostly on aggressive
ness.
In man-power the Cards rate
somewhat of an edge, for while
U.S.C. counts mostly on Guard Jack
Lippert and Forward Bob Ormsby to
hang up points, Stanford has any
number of men who may take high
scoring honors, especially Don Wil
liams, Kenny Davidson, and Fordy
Anderson.
WILLIAMS LOOKS HOT
As shown by the season statistics
printed in yesterday's Daily, Wil
liams is the leading Indian scorer,
having tallied HO field goals and 17
free throws for a total of 137 points
j in nine games played, including the
U.S.F. game in which he played only
I a few minutes. Anderson and Dav
idson are next with 70 and 64 points,
respectively.
Williams will probably be hot to
night; he usually is. The question
seems to be: Will enough other In
dians ring up points to outscore the
Trojans? Last season Kenny Dav
! idson could always be counted on
for buckets at the right time, for he
was the leading guard in the South
ern Division scoring columns. This
year, however, Davidson hasn't
been hitting the hoop with his former
regularity, although he is still one of
the steadiest ball players on the
outfit.
ANDERSON IMPORTANT
Anderson has hot and cold nights.
On some nights he spins them in
from under the bucket and from
outside the keyhole; on other nights
the hoop just seems to have a lid
over it as far as he is concerned. If
the smallish, baby-faced forward
has a sharp eye tonight, it may
mean a victory for the Indians in
their first conference encounter.
Don Burness is potentially the
best center in California. Certainly
he plays the most effortless basket
'ball of any of the pivot men here
abouts. As a point-getter, Burness
was phenomenal in high school, hav
ing established the San Francisco
prep scoring record. And in the
Santa Clara - Stanford game last
week-end he showed promise of be
coming one of the Indians' better
scorers as he finessed the highly
touted Jim Rickert time after time
to ring the gong for 12 points.
COWDEN POINT-GETTER
The other Stanford guard, Bill
Cowden, has never been hailed as a
scoring great, getting credit for his
defensive prowess instead. But
statistics show that he has 60 points
to his credit this season, which rates
him right close to Davidson and
Anderson in the point ratings.
All in all, Coach Everett Dean has
turned out a ball club that definitely
looks like the best in the Southern
Division on paper and on records of
some past performances. Tonight's
and tomorrow night's results will
tell the story in facts.

Southern Division has seen in sev
eral years when they are "on their
game." And they have a habit of
being "on their game" when the
chips are down, as they most cer
tainly will be this week-end.
CHOICE OF STYLES
This pair of contests will give the
2(500 hoop fans who will pack the
Pavilion on each Friday and Satur
day night a chance to view two en
tirely different styles of basketball.
They will see a Stanford team that
features tricky ball-handling and
clever footwork, and a U.S.C. quin
tet that relies mostly on aggressive
ness.
In man-power the Cards rate
somewhat of an edge, for while
U.S.C. counts mostly on Guard Jack
Lippert and Forward Bob Ormsby to
hang up points, Stanford has any
number of men who may take high
scoring honors, especially Don Wil
liams, Kenny Davidson, and Fordy
Anderson.
WILLIAMS LOOKS HOT
As shown by the season statistics
printed in yesterday's Daily, Wil
liams is the leading Indian scorer,
having tallied HO field goals and 17
free throws for a total of 137 points
j in nine games played, including the
U.S.F. game in which he played only
I a few minutes. Anderson and Dav
idson are next with 70 and 64 points,
respectively.
Williams will probably be hot to
night; he usually is. The question
seems to be: Will enough other In
dians ring up points to outscore the
Trojans? Last season Kenny Dav
! idson could always be counted on
for buckets at the right time, for he
was the leading guard in the South
ern Division scoring columns. This
year, however, Davidson hasn't
been hitting the hoop with his former
regularity, although he is still one of
the steadiest ball players on the
outfit.
ANDERSON IMPORTANT
Anderson has hot and cold nights.
On some nights he spins them in
from under the bucket and from
outside the keyhole; on other nights
the hoop just seems to have a lid
over it as far as he is concerned. If
the smallish, baby-faced forward
has a sharp eye tonight, it may
mean a victory for the Indians in
their first conference encounter.
Don Burness is potentially the
best center in California. Certainly
he plays the most effortless basket
'ball of any of the pivot men here
abouts. As a point-getter, Burness
was phenomenal in high school, hav
ing established the San Francisco
prep scoring record. And in the
Santa Clara - Stanford game last
week-end he showed promise of be
coming one of the Indians' better
scorers as he finessed the highly
touted Jim Rickert time after time
to ring the gong for 12 points.
COWDEN POINT-GETTER
The other Stanford guard, Bill
Cowden, has never been hailed as a
scoring great, getting credit for his
defensive prowess instead. But
statistics show that he has 60 points
to his credit this season, which rates
him right close to Davidson and
Anderson in the point ratings.
All in all, Coach Everett Dean has
turned out a ball club that definitely
looks like the best in the Southern
Division on paper and on records of
some past performances. Tonight's
and tomorrow night's results will
tell the story in facts.
If Stanford has the stuff to whip
the Trojans two nights in a row, the
Indians will really be the class of
the conference and the logical fa
vorites to represent the Southern
Division in the play-offs for the
championship of the Pacific Coast
Conference in the spring.
STARTING LINE-UP
If it's a split in these first two
games, the battle probably won't be
decided until later in the season.
And if Troy cops a pair, Sam Bar
ry's boys will be odds-on favorites
to cop the title for the second con
secutive year.
So the pressure is really on Dean
and his lads tonight. And most of
the experts in these parts are count
ing on them to come through.

Definitely planning to make their first steps in IJI4I conference basket
ball competition in the right direction, Stanford's highly-regarded cagers
battle the Terrible Trojans from U.9.C. in the Pavilion tonight and to
morrow night at 8 o'clock.
Whether the Indians are really deserving of the rank of favorites to cop

the crown in the Southern
of the Pacific Coast Conference will
in all probability be determined this
week-end. For it is almost a cer
tainty that if Stanford isn't the top
team, U.S.C. is.
And the Trojans, with a team that
has already turned in a conference
win over U.C.L.A., are out to prove
that the latter is the case. Of course,
there is a chance that the teams may
split this week-end's games, the first
half of the four-game series, in
which case little or nothing would be
determined.
GLOOMY SATURDAY?
The chances for an Indian victory
Friday night loom brighter than for
a Saturday night win for two rea
sons: (1) if this Card quintet is any
thing like last year's they will just
play a better game of basketball on
the first night, and (2) Coach Sam
Barry, Trojan cage mentor, always
turns out a rough, hard-to-handle
outfit that takes a lot out of its op
ponent in the first night of a two
game stand.
However, Everett Dean's team this
season may be just smooth enough
to be able to finesse the cagers from
Troy into defeat two nights in a
row.
There is little doubt that Wil
liams, Davidson & Co. are the
smoothest-functioning quintet the
Southern Division has seen in sev
eral years when they are "on their
game." And they have a habit of
being "on their game" when the
