# Stanford Five to Battle Trojan Champs Tonight In Conference Opener
## Indians Challenge Powerful U.S.C. Quintet for Southern Division Lead; Seek Revenge for Former Defeats 
### 
Definitely planning to make their first steps in IJI4I conference basket
ball competition in the right direction, Stanford's highly-regarded cagers
battle the Terrible Trojans from U.9.C. in the Pavilion tonight and to
morrow night at 8 o'clock.
Whether the Indians are really deserving of the rank of favorites to cop

the crown in the Southern
of the Pacific Coast Conference will
in all probability be determined this
week-end. For it is almost a cer
tainty that if Stanford isn't the top
team, U.S.C. is.
And the Trojans, with a team that
has already turned in a conference
win over U.C.L.A., are out to prove
that the latter is the case. Of course,
there is a chance that the teams may
split this week-end's games, the first
half of the four-game series, in
which case little or nothing would be
determined.
GLOOMY SATURDAY?
The chances for an Indian victory
Friday night loom brighter than for
a Saturday night win for two rea
sons: (1) if this Card quintet is any
thing like last year's they will just
play a better game of basketball on
the first night, and (2) Coach Sam
Barry, Trojan cage mentor, always
turns out a rough, hard-to-handle
outfit that takes a lot out of its op
ponent in the first night of a two
game stand.
However, Everett Dean's team this
season may be just smooth enough
to be able to finesse the cagers from
Troy into defeat two nights in a
row.
There is little doubt that Wil
liams, Davidson & Co. are the
smoothest-functioning quintet the
Southern Division has seen in sev
eral years when they are "on their
game." And they have a habit of
being "on their game" when the
chips are down, as they most cer
tainly will be this week-end.
CHOICE OF STYLES
This pair of contests will give the
2(500 hoop fans who will pack the
Pavilion on each Friday and Satur
day night a chance to view two en
tirely different styles of basketball.
They will see a Stanford team that
features tricky ball-handling and
clever footwork, and a U.S.C. quin
tet that relies mostly on aggressive
ness.
In man-power the Cards rate
somewhat of an edge, for while
U.S.C. counts mostly on Guard Jack
Lippert and Forward Bob Ormsby to
hang up points, Stanford has any
number of men who may take high
scoring honors, especially Don Wil
liams, Kenny Davidson, and Fordy
Anderson.
WILLIAMS LOOKS HOT
As shown by the season statistics
printed in yesterday's Daily, Wil
liams is the leading Indian scorer,
having tallied HO field goals and 17
free throws for a total of 137 points
