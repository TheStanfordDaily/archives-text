# Robert Casadesus to Appear In A.S.S.U. Concert Monday
## 
### 
Second of Stanford's four A.S.S.U. j
sponsored concerts will feature the
piano artistry of Robert Casadesus,
famed French concert pianist now
residing in America since the Nazi
occupation.
He will appear on the stage of
Memorial Theater Monday evening
at 8:15 o'clock.
Engaged by the Concert Series in
response to student requests for
more instrumental artists, Casadesus'
program will be taken from the
works of Beethoven, Chopin, Ravel,
Schumann, Schubei't, and Chabrier.
He has been highly acclaimed
throughout Europe and America.
Virgil Thompson of the New York
Herald Tribune recently wrote, "I
would be willing to walk a mile or
two (and have done so) to hear Rob
ert Casadesus play practically any
thing at any time."
When playing with the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra the au
dience was so insistent in its ap
plause that he was required to play
an encore, a rare occasion when

playing with a symphony.
Tickets are still available at the
Concert Series office in the Old
Union and will be sold at the box
office Monday night.
