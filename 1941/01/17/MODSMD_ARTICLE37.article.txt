# Frosh Quintet To Face Fast Bulldog Cagers
## 
### 
An invading hand from San Ma
teo J. C. led by Ramon Cortez will
battle Stanford's yearling quintet to
night in the Pavilion at 6:30 o'clock
in a game that has all the earmarks
of being as close a struggle as the
varslty-S.C. titanic which follows
at 8 o'clock.
The speedy Cortez set a new J. C.
scoring record when he hit the
bucket for a total of 33 points against
Bakorsfield in a Junior College
tournament held a couple of weeks
ago.
Coached by Clyde Devine, the
Bulldogs boast of three veterans
from the prep leagues: Hank Jan
viere, forward; Bob Whitmore, also
a forward; and the only six-footer
on the squad, Guard Bob Sheehan.
BATTLE AT CENTER
The highly-touted Cortez hails
from South San Francisco, where he
Was a standout as high-scoring cen
ter. Only disadvantage he will have
tonight is that skyscraper Bob
Wriesner will be towering over him.
Devine said after the Santa Clara
debacle that the Bronco freshmen
were the finest he has seen all sea
son, but that his own squad just
couldn't get going. He expects Cor
tez to give the whole Stanford team
plenty of trouble with his dead-eye
shooting.
Starting line-up for the frosh will
probably be the same as it has been
in past games, except for Bill
Hooper, who may not see action to
night because of a cold which has
been bothering him all week.
Hooper hit the basket for 16 points
to take high-scoring honors against
Commerce High last week but was
unable to play last Monday against
Palo Alto. He has been taking light
workouts this week and if the doc
tor gives his okay the stellar frosh
guard will start.
ADD MENLO J. C.
Rangy Jim Pollard will divide the
forward spots with Dick West, and
Hooper and Dick Middleton will hold
down the guard positions.
Coach Beeb Lee has scheduled
another tough nut for the frosh to
crack tomorrow night when they
meet Menlo J. C. in the first game
of tomorrow's double-header.
Tonight's probable line-ups:
Stanford San Mateo
Pollard F Whitmore
West F Janviere
Wreisncr C Cortez

ADD MENLO J. C.
Rangy Jim Pollard will divide the
forward spots with Dick West, and
Hooper and Dick Middleton will hold
down the guard positions.
Coach Beeb Lee has scheduled
another tough nut for the frosh to
crack tomorrow night when they
meet Menlo J. C. in the first game
of tomorrow's double-header.
Tonight's probable line-ups:
Stanford San Mateo
Pollard F Whitmore
West F Janviere
Wreisncr C Cortez
Hocper G Sheehan
Middleton G Sorick
An invading hand from San Ma
teo J. C. led by Ramon Cortez will
battle Stanford's yearling quintet to
night in the Pavilion at 6:30 o'clock
in a game that has all the earmarks
of being as close a struggle as the
varslty-S.C. titanic which follows
at 8 o'clock.
The speedy Cortez set a new J. C.
scoring record when he hit the
bucket for a total of 33 points against
Bakorsfield in a Junior College
tournament held a couple of weeks
ago.
Coached by Clyde Devine, the
Bulldogs boast of three veterans
from the prep leagues: Hank Jan
viere, forward; Bob Whitmore, also
a forward; and the only six-footer
on the squad, Guard Bob Sheehan.
BATTLE AT CENTER
The highly-touted Cortez hails
from South San Francisco, where he
Was a standout as high-scoring cen
ter. Only disadvantage he will have
tonight is that skyscraper Bob
Wriesner will be towering over him.
Devine said after the Santa Clara
debacle that the Bronco freshmen
were the finest he has seen all sea
son, but that his own squad just
couldn't get going. He expects Cor
tez to give the whole Stanford team
plenty of trouble with his dead-eye
shooting.
Starting line-up for the frosh will
probably be the same as it has been
in past games, except for Bill
Hooper, who may not see action to
night because of a cold which has
been bothering him all week.
Hooper hit the basket for 16 points
to take high-scoring honors against
Commerce High last week but was
unable to play last Monday against
Palo Alto. He has been taking light
workouts this week and if the doc
tor gives his okay the stellar frosh
guard will start.
