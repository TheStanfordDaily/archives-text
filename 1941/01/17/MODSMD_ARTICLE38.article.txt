## 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. 16 (UP). —
Back from the land of darkness

surgeon, and he is confident he will
regain the title when he climbs into
the ring before more than 17,000
fans at Madison Square Garden.

him the 7'& to 5 favorite over the
pug-nosed Pittsburgher who almost

thrill-packed encounter. They be
lieve the bull-shouldered Los An
geles Negro can whip Zivic, if he
can see.

Highways of the world have in
creased from 6,582,001 to 10,036,233
miles in the past 10 years.
