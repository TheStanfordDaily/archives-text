### JERRY BRUCKER 
VST/HAT gives on this campus, any
how?
Tonight and tomorow night Ev
erett Dean's basketeers open their
conference season against by all odds
their toughest competition, Sam
Barry's title-defending U.S.C. Tro
jans.
For the piddling sum of 40 cents
or, as our neighbors to the south
say, quarenta centavos, you, and
you, and even Bud Ames can get a
ticket. Eighty cents to see basket
ball the likes of which hasn't ap
peared around these parts since that
guy Luisetti wound up his college
career.
So what happens?
Give up?
Well, it's like this, Joe.
* * *
APPROXIMATELY 1(500 Stan
ford students are interested
enough to turn out each night and
condescend to watch the two best
basketball teams on the Coast in
action.
Mighty white of 'em, isn't it. But
how about the some 3400 other Stan
ford students who won't be there
each night? What's the deal on
them? Discounting Phi Betes and
moi'ons, where's the school spirit
around here?
Well, it seems there's a Pledge
Prom Friday night and the sororities
are holding open house along the
Row Saturday night. So the Farm
goes social, and the Indian court
ment will just have to struggle along
with 1600 rooters.

J7VERETT DEAN has been work
ing for two years to develop a
team that has a good chance to cop
the Coast title. A dozen or so men
on the squad gave up their Christ
mas vacations in order to play sev
eral tough games so they'd be ready
to open against the champs.
And a good deal less than half
the student body is going to take
an hour and a half off from the
gay social whirl to root for this
outfit each night. The rest will
he too busy.
The girls wouldn't miss you if you
showed up a little late at the sorori
ties. And things won't really get
rolling at the Pledge Prom until 10
o'clock at the earliest.
It's too late to do much about it
now. The remaining tickets have

gone on public sale. But maybe when
the Indians play Cal over at Ber
keley we can make it up to them by
journeying across the bay en masse
to give them some real support.

showed up a little late at the sorori
ties. And things won't really get
rolling at the Pledge Prom until 10
o'clock at the earliest.
It's too late to do much about it
now. The remaining tickets have

gone on public sale. But maybe when
the Indians play Cal over at Ber
keley we can make it up to them by
journeying across the bay en masse
to give them some real support.
VST/HAT gives on this campus, any
how?
Tonight and tomorow night Ev
erett Dean's basketeers open their
conference season against by all odds
their toughest competition, Sam
Barry's title-defending U.S.C. Tro
jans.
For the piddling sum of 40 cents
or, as our neighbors to the south
say, quarenta centavos, you, and
you, and even Bud Ames can get a
ticket. Eighty cents to see basket
ball the likes of which hasn't ap
peared around these parts since that
guy Luisetti wound up his college
career.
So what happens?
Give up?
Well, it's like this, Joe.

APPROXIMATELY 1(500 Stan
ford students are interested
enough to turn out each night and
condescend to watch the two best
basketball teams on the Coast in
action.
Mighty white of 'em, isn't it. But
how about the some 3400 other Stan
ford students who won't be there
each night? What's the deal on
them? Discounting Phi Betes and
moi'ons, where's the school spirit
around here?
Well, it seems there's a Pledge
Prom Friday night and the sororities
are holding open house along the
Row Saturday night. So the Farm
goes social, and the Indian court
ment will just have to struggle along
with 1600 rooters.

J7VERETT DEAN has been work
ing for two years to develop a
team that has a good chance to cop
the Coast title. A dozen or so men
on the squad gave up their Christ
mas vacations in order to play sev
eral tough games so they'd be ready
to open against the champs.
And a good deal less than half
the student body is going to take
an hour and a half off from the
gay social whirl to root for this
outfit each night. The rest will
he too busy.
The girls wouldn't miss you if you
showed up a little late at the sorori
ties. And things won't really get
rolling at the Pledge Prom until 10
o'clock at the earliest.
