## 
### 
With prospects becoming increas
ingly bright for a successful season.
Stanford's ruggers start out with a
, double-header 011 the local Held to-
I morrow afternoon.
The Cardinal varsity will jangle
with the University Club, composed
of ex-California stars, in the first
game, and the junior varsity will
tcke on the Mcnlo Junior College
squad in the final.
"No teams have been selected to
start the game as yet," stated Coach
Harry Maloney last night, "but all
men other than freshmen suiting up
for the game will play in either the
first or second contest."
FEW PRACTICES
Stanford has only had three prac
tices this season, due to the wet and
muddy condition of the practice
field, and consequently the coaching
stafi has not as yet had time to Select
the starters. Lists of the men who
are to start the two games will be
posted on the gymnasium bulletin
board after tomorrow afternoon's
practice.
The coaching staff at Stanford is
unique in that all of them, with the
exception of Maloney, are dollar-a
year-men that don't even get the
dollar, but are out there for the fun
of it and the love of the game. Jim
Wylie, head coach, first came to the
United States in 1912 with an all-
Australian team that played matches
throughout the country. Returning
to his home in New Zealand at the
close of the tour, he came to this
country again in the fall of 1913
with a team called the New Zealand
All-Blacks, so called because of the
colors of their jerseys, and remained
here at the end of their campaign
and entered Stanford.

j pic Games held in Paris.
With prospects becoming increas
ingly bright for a successful season.
Stanford's ruggers start out with a
, double-header 011 the local Held to-
I morrow afternoon.
The Cardinal varsity will jangle
with the University Club, composed
of ex-California stars, in the first
game, and the junior varsity will
tcke on the Mcnlo Junior College
squad in the final.
"No teams have been selected to
start the game as yet," stated Coach
Harry Maloney last night, "but all
men other than freshmen suiting up
for the game will play in either the
first or second contest."
FEW PRACTICES
Stanford has only had three prac
tices this season, due to the wet and
muddy condition of the practice
field, and consequently the coaching
stafi has not as yet had time to Select
the starters. Lists of the men who
are to start the two games will be
posted on the gymnasium bulletin
board after tomorrow afternoon's
practice.
The coaching staff at Stanford is
unique in that all of them, with the
exception of Maloney, are dollar-a
year-men that don't even get the
dollar, but are out there for the fun
of it and the love of the game. Jim
Wylie, head coach, first came to the
United States in 1912 with an all-
Australian team that played matches
throughout the country. Returning
to his home in New Zealand at the
close of the tour, he came to this
country again in the fall of 1913
with a team called the New Zealand
All-Blacks, so called because of the
colors of their jerseys, and remained
here at the end of their campaign
and entered Stanford.
