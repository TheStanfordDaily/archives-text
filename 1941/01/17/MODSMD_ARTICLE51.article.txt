WE of the so-called stronger sex often find
the intricacies of women's doings in gen
eral quite beyond our realm of understanding.
In specific, the foibles and hubba-hubba of
soiority rushing have always taken the cake.
Thus it was with some interest that the con
tention advanced in a recent Campus Opinion
letter, which appeared on the back pages of
Tuesday's Daily, was noticed. The letter, writ
ten by "one of the sisters," listed parental inter
ference as one of the greatest factors making for
discomfort and actual unhappiness.
With usual male abruptness, most of us dis
missed the contention as mere twaddle. It was
rather a surprise to find the upper-division
womenfolk of the Farm referring to it as the
"cold dope."
They should know. They've been through
it all.
All will tell you the same story. It's no soft
job convincing the folks that things "aren't the
same as when you went to college, mother."
And making up your own mind is a hard thing
to do without the telegram that comes every
noon and the phone call every evening to make
things harder.
Girls who joined a house are agreed along
much the same line. Many who joined house
A instead of sorority B (which was mother's or
Aunt Suzy's) were faced with the very definite
problem of explaining it all when mother (or
Aunt Suzy) once got them home. The problem
was there, but in almost every nstance every
one was happy once explanations were finally
put across.
The girl who joined sorority B, because of
parental pressure, has in some instances man
aged to find her own niche. In other instances
she has found to her dismay that mother was
wrong after all. Mother may admit it, shortly
after pledging, but the understanding sympathy
has come too late.
Women who didn't pledge admit what prob
ably is an even greater problem of explanation.
Sometimes the choice was their own, some
times not. And it took a bit of time before they
realized that at a school like Stanford it didn't
really matter after all.
Tomorrow it's all over again till next year.
And the women—Row and Hall—who have
been through it can vouch that both they and
their parents are satisfied at whatever course
was taken.
Take it from the upperclass women. They
know.—W. C.

It has always seemed to me that the best
outcome for the first World War would have
been the "peace without victory" which Presi
dent Wilson sought to secure in 1916; and it
has always seemed to me that the most tragic
aspect of the whole episode was the manner
in which the United States disgualified itself,
in the early war years, for working to such
an end. . . .and in the same way it seems idle
to me now to suppose that in the far more
desperate times of 1941, we can fall back
upon any given solutions simply because
they might conceivably have worked a quar
ter of a century ago.—Walter Millis

It has always seemed to me that the best
outcome for the first World War would have
been the "peace without victory" which Presi
dent Wilson sought to secure in 1916; and it
has always seemed to me that the most tragic
aspect of the whole episode was the manner
in which the United States disgualified itself,
in the early war years, for working to such
an end. . . .and in the same way it seems idle
to me now to suppose that in the far more
desperate times of 1941, we can fall back
upon any given solutions simply because
they might conceivably have worked a quar
ter of a century ago.—Walter Millis
WE of the so-called stronger sex often find
the intricacies of women's doings in gen
eral quite beyond our realm of understanding.
In specific, the foibles and hubba-hubba of
soiority rushing have always taken the cake.
Thus it was with some interest that the con
tention advanced in a recent Campus Opinion
letter, which appeared on the back pages of
Tuesday's Daily, was noticed. The letter, writ
ten by "one of the sisters," listed parental inter
ference as one of the greatest factors making for
discomfort and actual unhappiness.
With usual male abruptness, most of us dis
missed the contention as mere twaddle. It was
rather a surprise to find the upper-division
womenfolk of the Farm referring to it as the
"cold dope."
They should know. They've been through
it all.
All will tell you the same story. It's no soft
job convincing the folks that things "aren't the
same as when you went to college, mother."
And making up your own mind is a hard thing
to do without the telegram that comes every
noon and the phone call every evening to make
things harder.
Girls who joined a house are agreed along
much the same line. Many who joined house
A instead of sorority B (which was mother's or
Aunt Suzy's) were faced with the very definite
problem of explaining it all when mother (or
Aunt Suzy) once got them home. The problem
was there, but in almost every nstance every
one was happy once explanations were finally
put across.
The girl who joined sorority B, because of
parental pressure, has in some instances man
aged to find her own niche. In other instances
she has found to her dismay that mother was
wrong after all. Mother may admit it, shortly
after pledging, but the understanding sympathy
has come too late.
Women who didn't pledge admit what prob
ably is an even greater problem of explanation.
Sometimes the choice was their own, some
times not. And it took a bit of time before they
realized that at a school like Stanford it didn't
really matter after all.
Tomorrow it's all over again till next year.
And the women—Row and Hall—who have
been through it can vouch that both they and
their parents are satisfied at whatever course
was taken.
Take it from the upperclass women. They
know.—W. C.
