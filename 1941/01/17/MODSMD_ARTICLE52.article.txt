# It Can't Happen Here
## 
### 
FRONT-PAGED on yesterday's Daily was a
photograph portraying a bonfire on the West
wood campus in which U.C.L.A. students were
burning several hundred old radios. The flam
ing spectacle was intended as a demonstration
against the current A.S.C.A.P.-8.M.1. contro
versy.
The incident, which achieved national recog
nition, was only one of similar demonstrations
during recent months in which college students
condoned or condemned the latest happenings
in the news.
U.C.L.A.'s outbreak reached the pages of
many of the nation's dailies. Most readers
chuckled, then tagged it just "another damn
fool college trick."
Most readers were right. It was.
It can't happen here. There's another "damn
fool college trick" that the Farm has either un
consciously assimilated or just as unconsciously
created. And that's the trick of just not being
interested in what goes on in the world about us.
Call it the well-known "Stanford inertia"; call
it our equally famous "ivy-tower attitude"—the
fact remains that somehow the Farm just isn't
curious about news emanating from the other
side of the moat we have dug around the
borders of the campus.
There are exceptions. But as usual, these only
serve to prove the rule.
It isn't just that the comics and sports sections
are the only portions of the city dailies that re
ceive attention; nor is it merely that top-notch
celebrities on the Memorial Hall rostrum draw
empty seats and Palo Alto matrons—it's that

plus the fact that no one bothers to get hepped
up about anything.
Last November someone did. The rejuve
nated Stanford Forum drew an audience of over
200 with its discussion of the presidential quali
fications of Roosevelt and Willkie.
With its initial venture tucked under its belt,
the Forum embarked upon a policy of follow
ing up the November effort whenever national
or international news warranted it.
The Forum would have a hard time finding
a better and more bitterly contested subject than
the lend-lease proposal over which armed
camps have already begun battle in Congress.
Perhaps only the 200 who attended in No
vember will turn out again. Perhaps good tim
ing and publicity can turn out double that
number. It could be a good deal.
It's worth a try. —W. C.
