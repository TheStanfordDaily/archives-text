### BUD AMES 
DIMES FOIt GOOD CAUSES
| is the time to clear up a few little old notes
left over in the notebook.
And believe it or not, the first thing right off the
bat is another bit of trouble that has been brewing in
the Cellar—of all places. If it isn't the Bookstore,
then you can be as confident as the fraternity with 23
pledges that it will be the Cellar.
And this time it's the nickelodeon.
Yesterday afternoon the hashers swept up a
crumbled sobbing body along with three cigarette
package wrappers, a hoard of crushed coke cups and
three medium-sized crushed blondes.
Pledging trouble? No, the body sobbed, nickelodeon
trouble.
SEE, the body was a hep, a gate, from way, way
back. And he was just nuts, simply mad over that
super new Artie Shaw quintet and their rending
(meant to be spelled, rending) of "I Hear That Rhap
sody for the 87th Time."
So up he steps to the machine, with all its blinking
lights, and while everybody watches—for falling change
—he plunks down number 8 and number 13 buttons,
pushes in a whole dime, and retires to listen to that
jumpy stuff which features 15 drums and 32 double
cymbals down front.
No sooner has he disappeared into the back room
than a dark looking individual in a block S sweater
tries to see if it's too late to get the dime out. It is.
But he tried hard. So he flicks up the buttons, and
flips down number 15 and number 16.
And what happens. You get "Trade Winds" and
"Sweet Molly Malone." (Call 22151.)
Or maybe "Java Jive' sung by three effeminate
negroes.

something be done to correct this wrong?
J Must this poor soul be forced to go through life
distrusting his fellow men? Must he? In the name of
decency, democracy and the Fiftieth Anniversary,
this is made to you. Give this man a break. Let his
dime go to a good cause—not for "Trade Winds" or
"Sweet Molly Malone" or "Java Jive" sung by three
effeminate negroes.
"Oh, Charlie, please play that 'South American
Way.' Doesn't that Mexican from Brooklyn just send
you?"

And speaking about dimes going to a good cause,
some agent has been running around screaming about
plunking your dimes into the March of Dimes banks.
Which is a good idea. Just give up one of those cokes
with spots in the bottom of the glass and drop that
dime instead into the bank.
Brother and sister, you may be next.
But you've got to admit that there's something dia
bolical about Kenny Cameron's being the representa
tive for his house in the March of Dimes drive.

pushes in a whole dime, and retires to listen to that
jumpy stuff which features 15 drums and 32 double
cymbals down front.
No sooner has he disappeared into the back room
than a dark looking individual in a block S sweater
tries to see if it's too late to get the dime out. It is.
But he tried hard. So he flicks up the buttons, and
flips down number 15 and number 16.
And what happens. You get "Trade Winds" and
"Sweet Molly Malone." (Call 22151.)
Or maybe "Java Jive' sung by three effeminate
negroes.

something be done to correct this wrong?
J Must this poor soul be forced to go through life
distrusting his fellow men? Must he? In the name of
decency, democracy and the Fiftieth Anniversary,
this is made to you. Give this man a break. Let his
dime go to a good cause—not for "Trade Winds" or
"Sweet Molly Malone" or "Java Jive" sung by three
effeminate negroes.
"Oh, Charlie, please play that 'South American
Way.' Doesn't that Mexican from Brooklyn just send
you?"

And speaking about dimes going to a good cause,
some agent has been running around screaming about
plunking your dimes into the March of Dimes banks.
Which is a good idea. Just give up one of those cokes
with spots in the bottom of the glass and drop that
dime instead into the bank.
Brother and sister, you may be next.
But you've got to admit that there's something dia
bolical about Kenny Cameron's being the representa
tive for his house in the March of Dimes drive.

| is the time to clear up a few little old notes
left over in the notebook.
And believe it or not, the first thing right off the
bat is another bit of trouble that has been brewing in
the Cellar—of all places. If it isn't the Bookstore,
then you can be as confident as the fraternity with 23
pledges that it will be the Cellar.
And this time it's the nickelodeon.
Yesterday afternoon the hashers swept up a
crumbled sobbing body along with three cigarette
package wrappers, a hoard of crushed coke cups and
three medium-sized crushed blondes.
Pledging trouble? No, the body sobbed, nickelodeon
trouble.
SEE, the body was a hep, a gate, from way, way
back. And he was just nuts, simply mad over that
super new Artie Shaw quintet and their rending
(meant to be spelled, rending) of "I Hear That Rhap
sody for the 87th Time."
So up he steps to the machine, with all its blinking
lights, and while everybody watches—for falling change
—he plunks down number 8 and number 13 buttons,
pushes in a whole dime, and retires to listen to that
jumpy stuff which features 15 drums and 32 double
cymbals down front.
