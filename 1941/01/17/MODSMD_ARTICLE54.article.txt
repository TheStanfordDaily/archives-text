# CAMPUS OPINION

MILK-FED PRUNELLA

|JEAR EDITOR:
I do hope I may call you dear—my sister knew
you and spoke of you so often. (Really, I always
looked forward to coming here to Stanford partly be
cause I hoped some day to know you.)
Some people say Stanford is wicked! That the
students are frivolous and carnal and don't give a
damn (please don't think I'm profane, but this is im
portant!) Really, I had begun to fear, to just tremble
that this was actually true!
But the recent letters about smoking and drinking
to Campus Opinion (it is such a super column) have
made me think that some Stanford students do have
souls.
Because smoking is so terrible and sinful, too. And
my favorite line of poetry is "Lips that touch liquor
will never touch mine." A girl must be so careful
for her spotless soul. Mother always said, "If you're
drunk you're sunk." And that's true, too. Don't you
think so?
Before, I've always been afraid to write—but now
with these courageous letters that have already been
written, I can open my heart and speak of what has
long troubled me—the evils of drinking milk!
I think milk-drinking is a habit. Our mothers
started us on it before we had a chance. And then
we, because we don't listen hard enough for the Voice
of Conscience, let it become a habit. And habits are
so wicked! Habit-forming drugs are a horrible leaven
in society, ruining men and breaking up homes—and
yet we fail to recognize milk-drinking for the in
sidious habit it is!
I feel sorrier for milkmen than anybody.
And the poor cows! How would you like to be a
cow?
It's just too awful.
I do feel almost ashamed for using your valuable
time, but it's important to me, and I just had to give
my Message.
Horty sends her love.

r EDITOR, SIR:
Have you noticed the placards which someone
has placed on bulletin boards about the campus, de
riding the "Csar" of the Board of Athletic Control for
recent action which resulted in the termination of
Bill Ellington's 14-year service at Stanford? They're
quite forceful, as you must admit.
The B.A.C. takes a terrific pasting from the stu
dents, and has for quite some time. Seemingly the
Board deserves most of the censure it gets.
But in all cases this group is acting along a course
which it thinks best, and a course which is calcu
lated for a better athletic life on the Farm.
Then why don't they tell us about it? Why do
they wait until someone else hands the information to
the students in the worst possible light?
The B.A.C, certainly is aware of the spot they hold
in student opinion. Why don't they play ball with us
and do something about it?

dents, and has for quite some time. Seemingly the
Board deserves most of the censure it gets.
But in all cases this group is acting along a course
which it thinks best, and a course which is calcu
lated for a better athletic life on the Farm.
Then why don't they tell us about it? Why do
they wait until someone else hands the information to
the students in the worst possible light?
The B.A.C, certainly is aware of the spot they hold

and do something about it?

I do hope I may call you dear—my sister knew
you and spoke of you so often. (Really, I always
looked forward to coming here to Stanford partly be
cause I hoped some day to know you.)
Some people say Stanford is wicked! That the
students are frivolous and carnal and don't give a
damn (please don't think I'm profane, but this is im
portant!) Really, I had begun to fear, to just tremble
that this was actually true!
But the recent letters about smoking and drinking
to Campus Opinion (it is such a super column) have
made me think that some Stanford students do have
souls.
Because smoking is so terrible and sinful, too. And
my favorite line of poetry is "Lips that touch liquor
will never touch mine." A girl must be so careful
for her spotless soul. Mother always said, "If you're
drunk you're sunk." And that's true, too. Don't you
think so?
Before, I've always been afraid to write—but now
with these courageous letters that have already been
written, I can open my heart and speak of what has
long troubled me—the evils of drinking milk!
I think milk-drinking is a habit. Our mothers
started us on it before we had a chance. And then
we, because we don't listen hard enough for the Voice
of Conscience, let it become a habit. And habits are
so wicked! Habit-forming drugs are a horrible leaven
in society, ruining men and breaking up homes—and
yet we fail to recognize milk-drinking for the in
sidious habit it is!
I feel sorrier for milkmen than anybody.
And the poor cows! How would you like to be a
cow?
It's just too awful.
I do feel almost ashamed for using your valuable
time, but it's important to me, and I just had to give
my Message.
Horty sends her love.

Have you noticed the placards which someone

riding the "Csar" of the Board of Athletic Control for
recent action which resulted in the termination of
Bill Ellington's 14-year service at Stanford? They're
quite forceful, as you must admit.
