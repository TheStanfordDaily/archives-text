# Saroyan Reminiscences Make Whimsical Tales

"MY NAME IS ARAM,"by William Saroyan—llarcourt, Brace.
Here's another hit of Saroyan nostalgia. But there arc one or two
tilings (hat are singular aliout this opus. One* is thai it comes amazingly
close to proving that the author is almost as good as he' says he is.
"My Name Is Aram" is all about a small Armenian urchin, Aram
r» i_ i • / i i

Garoghlanian (gargle when you say>
it) and his tribe. It's a whimsical
yet sharply drawn picture of Saroy
an's early life in and around Fresno.
It is also a pertinent document of
first - generation immigrants in
America and how they do or don't
become oriented.
TASTY DISH
In the case of the Garoghlanians
the orientation just never had a
chance. That is what makes the book
so utterly delightful. For this is a
sort of Armenian version of Clar
ence Day's "Life with Father" (only
here the accent is on uncles) coupled
with Mark Twain's "Huckleberry
Finn."
Combine these elements with Wil
liam Saroyan, "the world's greatest
living author"—by his own modest
admission — and you have what
sounds like an indigestible literary
concoction, but what proves to be a
surprisingly tasty dish.
Like everything from the pen of
"the greatest living author" this
book will either send you or leave
you totally unsent. But viewing it
impartially, .there is no doubt but
that this is Saroyan's best work to
date.
CHARACTERS REAL
It is good because it is natural,
unpretentious, completely unaffect
ed, and sincere. It is good because it
is wistful without being maudlin,
nostalgic without being saccharine,
and naive without being shallow.
It's also good because it rings
true, because Aram's relatives —
while they may be nothing like
what you and I have around the
house—are real characters in both
the literary and literal sense of the
term.
The book is a collection of 14
short stories—many of which have
appeareel within the last few years '
published separately in magazines.
But because the theme of each is
basically the same, and because
Saroyan's approach is consistent,
they tie up beautifully into a uni

♦
fied book that is almost a novel.
The fact that almost every critic
who has reviewed the book has his
particular favorite story and each
one picks a different one seems to
be a pretty good endorsement of the
book as a whole.
The best ones, in the ejpinion of
this reviewer, are the one about
Aram and Lionel Strongfort; the one
about Dikran, the orator; the Pres
byterian choir singers (funniest of
the lot); the Ojibway Indian; and
"the poor and burning Arab." That's
five right there. At the risk of be
ing undiscrirninating, we could
come right out and say they're all
good—Reichert
