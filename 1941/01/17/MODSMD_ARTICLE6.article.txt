nothing" is left of the $2,000,000,000
which Britain put into an inter

the bill would confer on Mr. Roose
velt.
5. Senator Robert A. Taft, R.,
Ohio, said that numerous letters

for all possible aid to England
consistent with the United States
remaining at peace.

N.Y., introduced into the Congres
sional Record Willkie's statement
