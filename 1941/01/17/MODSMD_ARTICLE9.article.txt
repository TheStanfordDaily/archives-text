# Stanford to Host U.C. For Joffre Forensic Tilt
## 
### 
The Medaille Joffre Debate, oldest intercollegiate debate contest of its
kind in the United States, will be held again this year, according to Rob
ert Hammett, Farm debate manager, who received word from the Alliance
Francaise today. The contests will continue although the French Republic,
traditional subject of the debate, no longer exists.

Forty-seven years ago Baron
Pierre de Coubertin, the man who
brought the Olympic Games back to
the world, offered an award known
as the "Medaille Carnot" in honor of
the martyred French president, Sadi
Carnot. This award was to be pre
sented each year to the Stanford or
California speaker making the best
showing in an annual debate.
The name of the award was
changed in 1917 to the "Medaille
Joffre" in honor of the great French
war hero, Marshall Joffre. As a
further step toward international
understanding and good will be
tween the United States and
France, the French government took
official cognizance of the contest.
According to the debate rules, a
general subject on some phase of
French policy is selected by the two
schools several months prior to the
contest. After a period of intensive
study on the general subject, the
speakers are given a specific ques
tion, pertaining to the general sub
ject, two hours before the debate.
These rules tend to make the debate
an extemporaneous discussion, and
not a mere oratorical contest.
Last year Stanford's Sherman
Mellinkoff won the 46t.h annual de
bate, thus breaking a 22-22 tie be
tween Stanford and California. The
47th contest in tl.s series will be
held on the Stanford campus early
in March of this year.
