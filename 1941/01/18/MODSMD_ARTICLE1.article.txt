# Favored Farm Hoopman Squash Roughie-Toughie Troy, 43-37
## 
### 
Turning back a late U.S.C. rally
that brought the Trojans to with
in three points of the snappy In
dians, Stanford's cagers took the
Pacific Coast Confetence champs
down the line, 43-37, last night in
their opening bid for this year's
crown.
Coach Everett Dean's charges
started out like they were going to
run away with the Trojans, mov
ing into a 14-4 lead before the con
test was six minutes old. Stanford's
block and roll attack worked al
most to perfection during that
opening spree. Add a fast break that
had their opponents reeling, and
you have the reason the Indians
were never headed.

After that first spurt of Stanford
scoring the Trojans started to play
their ball game, but the Indians
were just too classy for Coach Sam
Barry's outfit last night, maintain
ing a comfortable margin through
out the first canto as the half ended
with the Indians enjoying a seven
point lead at 25-18.
At the outset of the second period
Bob Ormsby, high scoring U.S.C.
forward, hit the hoop for a field
goal to pull the Ttojans to within
five points, but Burness tallied on
a tip-in, Williams spun one in from
under the basket, Cowden added a
pair on a couple of free throws, and
Burness rang the gong again to
stretch Stanford's lead to 13 points
at 33-20, the largest margin the In
dians enjoyed.

Ormsby Stars

In tlie closing minutes of the con
test, Ormsby showed why he is
rated as one of the U.S.C. stars,
as he whipped in three field goals
while the Indian defense laxed a
little. With three minutes of play
remaining it was 40-37 and it looked
as if the Trojans might tie up the
old ball game. But Bill Cowden
turned a charity toss into a point
before he left the game on four
personal fouls. Then Fordy Ander
son swished the net with a spin
shot from beneath the bucket with
a half a minute to go.
At that point Stanford went in
to its effective stall game, and the
mighty Trojans were definitely on
the losing end.
Tied for Top
The victory puts the Indians into
a tie for the lead in the standings
of the Southern Division of the
P.C.C. California shares the con
ference lead with the Indians by
dint of a 42-32 win over U.C.L.A.
