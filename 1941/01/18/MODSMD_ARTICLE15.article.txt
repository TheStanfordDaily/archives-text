# Campus Views Relatively Sane Pledge Week
## 
### 
This has been a quiet rush week,
or relatively so compared to other
years, is the consensus of campus
opinion. No recurrence of the 1938
"Koble Revolt" occurred to mar
the smoothness of 1941 Greek letter
rushing and tonight's open house at
which the pledges will be presented
to the campus will climax what the
Farm hails as a "sane" rush week.
Attributing the noticeable lack of
Roble unrest to various reasons,
comments on the conduct of this
year's group ot rusiiees coincide
favorably.
Larger Periods
Discussing the new four period
rush week that was inaugurated this
year, Peg Stanfield, Pan Hellenic
head, emphasized the value of the
continuous periods. "The freshmen
don't have time to worry about it,*'
she said. "Of course it's awful wear
ing, but it's as hard on us as it is
on them."
Mary June Montgomery, Roble
Head Sponsor, commented on the
sensible attitude shown by the
freshmen as follows: "The sanity
with which the girls have conducted
themselves during this period of
rushing is indicative of a better
sense of values than I've seen in any
class in four years."
Row Agrees
Tri Delt senior, Marge Hovey,
though she bewailed the hectic
week and "rushing nerves", de
clared in favor of the four periods
of rushing. "It gives us a chance to
see more of the girls, and to get
to know them better."
She approved the "drop list" fea
ture of this year's rushing whereby
names which had been dropped by
one house could be picked up by
other interested houses, and the
fact that answers to rushing invita
tions were made binding this year.
Margaret Ray, Roble prexy, join
ed M. J. Montgomery, in crediting
the rushees with their share of
of praise for the comparative seren
ity of the last week, when she re
marked, "The girls have accepted
the system and the responsibility
of making their decisions them
selves. It's gratifying to see rushing
go so calmly."
