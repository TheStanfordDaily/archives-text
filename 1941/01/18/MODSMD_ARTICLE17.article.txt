It is well known that this year
the Sororities were trying out a new
system. Faults in it that were not
noticeable when merely written

put into effect. Now that these

basis of a revision in the program
for next year.
1 would like to express my ap
preciation for the sensible way in
which the freshmen and other new
women reacted to this entirely dif
ferent experience—added by the co
operation of the sponsors.
I sincerely hope that tonight's
new pledges will find in their sor
ority life invaluable experiences;
both as individuals and as members
of the Stanford student body.
