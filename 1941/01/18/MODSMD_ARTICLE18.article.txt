### 
Ninety-nine frosh women last
year trekked the path from Roble
Hall up the Row as pledges to the
Farm's nine sororities. Topping the
list was Alpha Phi, with 14 new
members. In second place were
Kappa Alpha Theta and Kappa
Kappa Kappa Gamma, with 13
pledges each.
Of last year's new pledges, 89
belonged to the class of 43, three
were sophomores, and seven were
juniors. The total pledge number
was 14 less than the number in
1939.
