# Women's Dormitories Offer Fine Facilities for Farmerettes
## 
### 
One hundred and eight Roble
women broke the first bonds of the
closely knit Roble unit tonight
when they selected the group in
which they will live for the rest of
their Stanford careers.
The same problem of choice will
face the remaining 180 feminine
members of the class of '44 in a
few months. Only, for them, it will
be simply a matter of the size and
type group in which they wish to
live. Their choice is not irrevocable.
Farm's '500'
The various upper class hall units
on the Farm accomodate approxi
mately 500 women, and in the eight
units, it is possible for the "hall"
women to find any sort of condi
tions she desires.
In Lagunita, "the most beautiful
dormitiry in America," Stanford's
alleged "country club" atmosphere
comes nearest physical realization.
The woman who wants diversified
companionship and her own wash
basin can find both there.
At the opposite pole from La
gunita is tiny Elm Cottage, housing
at the most 14 or 15 women. Be
tween the two hall extremes are
the remaining six halls. In the Un
ion, about 60 women find big dorm
itory conditions combined with a
more old fashioned atmosphere.
Union women like their quarters
because it's possible to get to an
8 o'clock without even opening
their eyes.
Smaller Units
About the same size as an aver
age sorority are Madrono, Mari
posa, Manganita, Cosa Ventura, and
Hawthorne. All of these except
Ventura are part of the Union Unit.
Madrono, particularly, prides itself
on its air of cameraderie, and notes,
with pleasure, that it has longest
waiting lists of all the halls.
If a woman chooses the smaller
living group, she must also choose
a brief walk before breakfast—if
she eats breakfast—since none of
them serve meals. Ventura women
eat at Lagunita and the remainder
in the Union.
Wide Preference
Statistics seem to indicate that
in most cases the hall a woman
chooses first is the one in which
she stays. It all seems to be a
matter of habit, and where she
makes her friends.
However, one thing the women of
the class of '44 are going to find
out next fall—if they haven't found
out already—is that Hall or Row
affiliations on the Farm don't make
a great deal of difference.

which they will live for the rest of
their Stanford careers.
The same problem of choice will
face the remaining 180 feminine
members of the class of '44 in a
few months. Only, for them, it will
be simply a matter of the size and
type group in which they wish to
live. Their choice is not irrevocable.
Farm's '500'
The various upper class hall units
on the Farm accomodate approxi
mately 500 women, and in the eight
units, it is possible for the "hall"
women to find any sort of condi
tions she desires.
In Lagunita, "the most beautiful
dormitiry in America," Stanford's
alleged "country club" atmosphere
comes nearest physical realization.
The woman who wants diversified
companionship and her own wash
basin can find both there.
At the opposite pole from La
gunita is tiny Elm Cottage, housing
at the most 14 or 15 women. Be
tween the two hall extremes are
the remaining six halls. In the Un
ion, about 60 women find big dorm
itory conditions combined with a
more old fashioned atmosphere.
Union women like their quarters
because it's possible to get to an
8 o'clock without even opening
their eyes.
Smaller Units
About the same size as an aver
age sorority are Madrono, Mari
posa, Manganita, Cosa Ventura, and
Hawthorne. All of these except
Ventura are part of the Union Unit.
Madrono, particularly, prides itself
on its air of cameraderie, and notes,
with pleasure, that it has longest
waiting lists of all the halls.
If a woman chooses the smaller
living group, she must also choose
a brief walk before breakfast—if
she eats breakfast—since none of
them serve meals. Ventura women
eat at Lagunita and the remainder
in the Union.
Wide Preference
Statistics seem to indicate that
in most cases the hall a woman
chooses first is the one in which
she stays. It all seems to be a
matter of habit, and where she
makes her friends.
However, one thing the women of
the class of '44 are going to find
out next fall—if they haven't found
out already—is that Hall or Row
affiliations on the Farm don't make
a great deal of difference.
One hundred and eight Roble
women broke the first bonds of the
closely knit Roble unit tonight
when they selected the group in
which they will live for the rest of
their Stanford careers.
