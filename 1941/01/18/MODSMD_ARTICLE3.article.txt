# Sororities Will Fete Pledges Tonight In Row Open Houses
## 
### 
Fairly shining with characteristic enthusiasm and expectancy, a
brand new crop of Row girls from the class of '44 is being feted tonight
as their older sisters in the Greek letter societies introduce them to the
campus.
Small dance orchestras and record players provide the background

for "getting acquainted" conversa-'
tion as well as dance music; and
punch and cookies or similar re
freshments figure prominently in
adding to the general festivities as
men from all over the campus rally
round to pass approval on the girls
who are destined to live on the
Row for the next three years.
The nine sorority houses opened
their doors at 7:30 o'clock and will
stay open to all who wish to come
until 12 o'clock, the regular closing
hour for all women's residences
Saturday evenings. It is expected
that groups at the different houses
will grow larger after the finish of
Stanford-U.S.C. basketball game
which is being played at the Pa
vilion tonight.
After receiving their bids at
Roble, pledges were driven up the
Rdw by alumnae members of Cap
and Gown who traditionally con
duct neophytes to the house of their
choice.
Formal pledging will take place
either right after the house closes
tonight or tomorrow morning when
pledges will have had a chance to
rest up from festivities in their fu
ture homes.
Tomorrow noon will see soror
ities welcoming their new members
at banquets, after which Robleites
will return to the freshman hall to
exchange confidences and chatter,
having formally become the better
half of the Class of '44 Row con
tingent.
