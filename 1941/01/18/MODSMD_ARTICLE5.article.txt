# New Rushing System Called 'Step Forword'
## 
### 
Members of the current crop of
sorority pledges arc products of a
rushing system drastically remod
eled since last year's open season on
frosli and other new students.
Since winter, 1940, perhaps the
major shift has been from a three
period, seven-day skirmish to a
four-period, nine-day system. This
change was made in the hope that
the Row would become better ac
quainted with its rushees and vice
versa. It was also expected that
the new system would eliminate, to
a degree, late rushing.
Day of Silence
Rushing formerly started on a
Friday, ran through until Wednes
day, which was dramatically tag
ged, "The Day of Silence." Prefer
ence dinners followed on Thursday
and Friday nights, with pledging
on Saturday.
"The Day of Silence" gave rush
ees the luxury of 24-hours in which
to brood, to give way to indecisive
ness and to run up long distance
telephone hills on their families.
In utilizing this day and also the
proceeding Thursday, tiie present
system results in the most intensive
rushing yet conducted on the
campus.
Women who have previously eu
gaged in rushing will grasp immed
iately the import of a Pan Hell re
vision which states that students
attending two preference dinners at
the same house are assured an in
vitation to pledge that house. If
this rule survives, it will eliminate
the sorriest sight of rushing: the
girl who believes herself set, hav
ing been bid to two dinners, only to
be left without the invitation to
pledge.
It's Over Now
Also designed to prevent late
rushing is the drop list, now uti
lized. Final preferences of rushees
were checked down to second and
third choices to insure against
either house or rushee being over
looked in the final reckoning.
Although both Row women and
rushees bear unmistakable traces of
their nine-day ordeal, the longer,
more intensive period has its ad
vantages and these may outweigh
the various strains. Box scores on
the whole situation are back now
and decision will be made now that
all the returns arc in.
Sponsors, Row women, and
Frosh alike can relax and say "It's
over now."
