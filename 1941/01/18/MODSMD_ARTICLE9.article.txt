## 
### 
Stanford's yearling hoop squad
collides with Menlo J. C. tonight
after successfully stopping San Ma
teo's Ramon Cortez and company,
38-33, in a nip and tuck battle play
ed in the Pavilion last night.
In winning their sixth encounter
in seven starts, the '44 boys played
their best brand of basketball while
being constantly under pressure,
from start to finish.
Starting lackadaisically, the Pa
pooses found themselves on the
wrong end of a 15-7 score before
the game had been going ten min
utes. Unloosing a sudden barrage of
field goals, they climbed to a one
point, 19-18 lead, at the end of the
first half.
From there on the lead changed
hands every minute or so to keep
the spectators on their feet yelling
for more. Sorich missed a free
throw with a chance to tie up the
game at 31-all. Bob YVreisner took
a bounced pass from Bill Hooper
for a set-up and put the Frosh in
front, 33-31. They were never
headed after that, with the Frosh
adding five and the visitors two
for a final count of 38-33.
