### BOB LOW 
d \NE of the most influential forces I
in British life and politics, the J
Church of England, has stated the
war aims which it would like to see
realized upon England's victory.
For months Americans and Brit- I
ishers alike have looked in vain for I
a definite statement of policy by a
British spokesman.
The Church of England, tradi
tionally a stronghold of middle
and upper-class conservatism, has
accepted this challenge and has
made public a resolution adopted
by its leading clergymen which
might well be made accessible to
every reading and thinking man
the world over.
In the January 20 issue of '"Time,"
a resolution presented to the Mal
vern Conference by the Archbishop
of York is quoted. According to this
source, the resolution was received
without a single dissenting voice.
Since it appears to this writer that
this resolution warrants the consid
eration of everyone, several ex
cerpts from the document follow:
"After the war our aim must be
the unification of Europe as a co
operative commonwealth.
"In international trade a genuine
interchange of materially needed
commodities must take the place of
a struggle for so-called favorable
balance. . . .
"Christian doctrine must insist
that production exists for consump
tion. ... To a large extent produc
tion is carried on not to supply the
consumer with goods but to bring
profits to the producer. . . . The
monetary system must be so admin
istered that what the community
can produce is made available to the
members of the community, the
satisfaction of human needs being
accepted as the only true end of
production."
This is part of the resolution
adopted unanimously .
* * *
A N amendment to this resolution
was added by a large majority,
although it was admitted that there
was some objection to its passage.
It said in part:
"The ownership of the great re
sources . . . (by) private individuals
's a stumbling block. . . . The time
has come, therefore, for Christians
to proclaim the need for seeking
some form of society in which this
stumbling block will be removed."
These words do not come from a
group of crackpots seated about a
table in a dimly-lit cellar room.
They are the well considered
thoughts of some of the best edu
cated and best cultured men in the
world.
At the same time the gathering
proposed reforms for the structure
and function of the church itself. A
passage from this resolution fol
lows:
"The whole congregation . . .
should regularly meet to plan and
carry out some common enter
prise for the general good; if
there are social evils in a locality,
such as bad housing or malnutri
tion, let them consider how the
evil can be remedied."

8 N these resolutions there is faith
for the man who has been skep
tical. The coal miners of England,
one of the most poverty-stricken
groups in a civilized country, have
been fighting wholeheartedly, if re
ports in the United States are accu
rate, for a cause that the British
governing clique says is theirs.
Members of the working class in
this country, too, have questioned
the "social-mindedness" of Britain's
governing group. But here in the
words of a resolution set down by
the usually complacent Church of
England is the hope of a people.
The order of society envisioned in
these resolutions is the alternative
to the totalitarian way. The British
are fighting for the right to realize
these hopes; for the Britain of 1939
cannot be the Britain that survives
this war. It must be a Britain that
will move toward this new society
that leads the way in a world of
peace.
Totalitarianism thrives on want,
but cannot exist in a society where
human needs are satisfied.

Traffic deaths in the United States
during the first eight months of 1940
totaled 20,640, an increase of 7 per
cent over the same period in 1939.

by its leading clergymen which
might well be made accessible to
every reading and thinking man
the world over.
In the January 20 issue of '"Time,"
a resolution presented to the Mal
vern Conference by the Archbishop
of York is quoted. According to this
source, the resolution was received
without a single dissenting voice.
Since it appears to this writer that
this resolution warrants the consid
eration of everyone, several ex
cerpts from the document follow:
"After the war our aim must be
the unification of Europe as a co
operative commonwealth.
"In international trade a genuine
interchange of materially needed
commodities must take the place of
a struggle for so-called favorable
balance. . . .
"Christian doctrine must insist
that production exists for consump
tion. ... To a large extent produc
tion is carried on not to supply the
consumer with goods but to bring
profits to the producer. . . . The
monetary system must be so admin
istered that what the community
can produce is made available to the
members of the community, the
satisfaction of human needs being
accepted as the only true end of
production."
This is part of the resolution
adopted unanimously .

A N amendment to this resolution
was added by a large majority,
although it was admitted that there
was some objection to its passage.
It said in part:
"The ownership of the great re
sources . . . (by) private individuals
's a stumbling block. . . . The time
has come, therefore, for Christians
to proclaim the need for seeking
some form of society in which this
stumbling block will be removed."
These words do not come from a
group of crackpots seated about a
table in a dimly-lit cellar room.
They are the well considered
thoughts of some of the best edu
cated and best cultured men in the
world.
At the same time the gathering
proposed reforms for the structure
and function of the church itself. A
passage from this resolution fol
lows:
"The whole congregation . . .
should regularly meet to plan and
carry out some common enter
prise for the general good; if
there are social evils in a locality,
such as bad housing or malnutri
tion, let them consider how the
evil can be remedied."

8 N these resolutions there is faith
for the man who has been skep
tical. The coal miners of England,
one of the most poverty-stricken
groups in a civilized country, have
been fighting wholeheartedly, if re
ports in the United States are accu
rate, for a cause that the British
governing clique says is theirs.
Members of the working class in
this country, too, have questioned
the "social-mindedness" of Britain's
governing group. But here in the
words of a resolution set down by
the usually complacent Church of
England is the hope of a people.
The order of society envisioned in
these resolutions is the alternative
to the totalitarian way. The British
are fighting for the right to realize
these hopes; for the Britain of 1939
cannot be the Britain that survives
this war. It must be a Britain that
will move toward this new society
that leads the way in a world of
peace.
Totalitarianism thrives on want,
but cannot exist in a society where
human needs are satisfied.

the unification of Europe as a co
operative commonwealth.
"In international trade a genuine
interchange of materially needed
commodities must take the place of
a struggle for so-called favorable
balance. . . .
"Christian doctrine must insist
that production exists for consump

consumer with goods but to bring
profits to the producer. . . . The
monetary system must be so admin

can produce is made available to the
members of the community, the
satisfaction of human needs being
accepted as the only true end of
production."
This is part of the resolution
adopted unanimously .

A N amendment to this resolution
was added by a large majority,
although it was admitted that there
was some objection to its passage.
It said in part:
"The ownership of the great re
sources . . . (by) private individuals
's a stumbling block. . . . The time
has come, therefore, for Christians
to proclaim the need for seeking
some form of society in which this
stumbling block will be removed."
These words do not come from a
group of crackpots seated about a
table in a dimly-lit cellar room.
They are the well considered
thoughts of some of the best edu
cated and best cultured men in the
world.
At the same time the gathering
proposed reforms for the structure
and function of the church itself. A
passage from this resolution fol
lows:
"The whole congregation . . .
should regularly meet to plan and
carry out some common enter
prise for the general good; if
there are social evils in a locality,
such as bad housing or malnutri
tion, let them consider how the
evil can be remedied."

8 N these resolutions there is faith
for the man who has been skep
tical. The coal miners of England,
one of the most poverty-stricken
groups in a civilized country, have
been fighting wholeheartedly, if re
ports in the United States are accu
rate, for a cause that the British
governing clique says is theirs.
Members of the working class in
this country, too, have questioned
the "social-mindedness" of Britain's
governing group. But here in the
words of a resolution set down by
the usually complacent Church of
England is the hope of a people.
The order of society envisioned in
these resolutions is the alternative
to the totalitarian way. The British
are fighting for the right to realize
these hopes; for the Britain of 1939
cannot be the Britain that survives
this war. It must be a Britain that
will move toward this new society
that leads the way in a world of
peace.
Totalitarianism thrives on want,
but cannot exist in a society where
human needs are satisfied.

Traffic deaths in the United States
during the first eight months of 1940

d \NE of the most influential forces I
in British life and politics, the J
Church of England, has stated the
war aims which it would like to see
realized upon England's victory.
For months Americans and Brit- I
ishers alike have looked in vain for I
a definite statement of policy by a
British spokesman.
The Church of England, tradi
tionally a stronghold of middle
and upper-class conservatism, has
accepted this challenge and has
made public a resolution adopted
by its leading clergymen which
might well be made accessible to
every reading and thinking man
the world over.
In the January 20 issue of '"Time,"
a resolution presented to the Mal
vern Conference by the Archbishop
of York is quoted. According to this
source, the resolution was received
without a single dissenting voice.
Since it appears to this writer that
this resolution warrants the consid
eration of everyone, several ex
cerpts from the document follow:
"After the war our aim must be
the unification of Europe as a co
operative commonwealth.
"In international trade a genuine
interchange of materially needed
commodities must take the place of
a struggle for so-called favorable
balance. . . .
"Christian doctrine must insist
that production exists for consump
tion. ... To a large extent produc
tion is carried on not to supply the
consumer with goods but to bring
profits to the producer. . . . The
monetary system must be so admin
istered that what the community
can produce is made available to the
members of the community, the
satisfaction of human needs being
accepted as the only true end of
production."
