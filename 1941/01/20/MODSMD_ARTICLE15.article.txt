# March of Dimes Ends Wednesday
## 
### 
Stanford's "March of Dimes" goes
into its last lap this week, ending
on Wednesday. With only three
more days to go, the $400 quota is
still a long way off, having reached
approximately the 50 per cent mark.
Since Friday seven new houses
have added their names to the honor
roll in the drive to raise money for
the fight against infantile paralysis.
These are: Beta Theta Pi, Pi Beta
Phi, Chi Psi, Madrono, Kappa Sig
ma, Sigma Chi, and Kappa Kappa
Gamma.

House presidents of those living
groups who have not as yet collected
100 per cent contributions are re
quested by Drive Chairman Bob
McNeil to make a final effort in to
night's house meetings.
