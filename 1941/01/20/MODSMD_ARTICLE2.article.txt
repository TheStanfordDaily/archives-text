# F.R. to Take Third Pledge Today at 12
## Unprecedented Oath Ritual to Be Attended By Axis Envoy Corps 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 1!) (UP).—
Franklin Delano Roosevelt tomorrow
takes the oath as President of the
United States for the third time—a
privilege never before accorded any
man. Time for the event Ls noon.
In the heart of a nation at peace
and against the backdrop of a world
at war, Mr. Roosevelt will place his
left hand upon an ancient bible at the
stroke of noon, rtyse his right hand
and solemnly swear that he will:
"... Faithfully execute the office
of President of the United States;
and will, to the best of my ability,
preserve, protect, and defend the
Constitution of the United States."
TRADITION ENDED
The moment he utters those words,
the two-term tradition will have
ended officially and the nation will
embark on four presidential years
designed perhaps to be as fateful as
any in its history.
Ahead of the President lie deci
sions of tremendous scope.
His third inauguration comes at a
moment when the nation and the
world are awaiting the outcome of a
pending Congressional battle over
legislation that would bestow upon
Mr. Roosevelt broad powers to lend
or lease American armaments to
embattled democracies.
It comes at a time when, in Mr.
Roosevelt's own words, the United
States faces "an emergency as se
rious as war itself."
SITUATION GRAVE
Taking the gravity of the world
situation into consideration, the
President himself requested that
there be no elaborate ceremonies on
this historic occasion.
He set the pattern by limiting his
inaugural address to 12 minutes —
the same length as his first inaug
ural address in the bank crisis and
depression days of 1933 and eight
minutes shorter than his 1937
speech.
The inaugural parade has been
curtailed by comparison with that of
four years ago. In keeping with the
theme of the times, the parade will
emphasize national defense. Weather
permitting, 280 Army and Navy
planes will roar overhead. And, for
the first time, officers and men of
the Army's new armored force,
equipped with motorcycles, scout
cars, tanks, anti-aircraft guns, anti
tank guns and heavy field pieces
will participate in an inauguration.
The oath-taking will be witnessed
by diplomats of 56 nations, including
envoys of Axis powers whose gov
ernments Mr. Roosevelt has sharply
criticized. Italian, German and
Japanese diplomats were invited and
each has revealed intention of at
tending.
This will bring together, for the
first time since outbreak of the
European war, offiicals of the war
ring nations of Asia and Europe.
Custom dictates that envoys shall
be seated according to a traditional
system of rank, in the order of their
arrival here. By chance, neutral en
voys will sit in such an order as to
separate all hostile factions.
