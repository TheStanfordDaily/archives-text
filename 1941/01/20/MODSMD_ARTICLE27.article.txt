### HAROLD SHAFER 
The day that a biographer .sits [
himself down to record the successes i
of outstanding Stanford men and
women, he'll include the name of
Harold F. Elliott.
And for good reason, for Mr. El
liott, '16, and manager of the '16
Quad, will be featured in the special
engineering issue of the Stanford Il
lustrated Review next month as one
of 22 Stanford engineering graduates
who, for a time, worked for the old
Federal Telegraph Company of Palo
Alto and later became an outstand
ing inventor.
DEVELOPS TRANSMITTER
During the first World War, Mr.
Elliott was one of several Stanford
men who developed the Poulson arc
from the tiny Danish original to a
mechanism the castings for which
weigh 15 tons each.
The Poulson arc was the first suc
cessful continuous radio wave trans
mitter, and after the American pat
ents had been secured for Federal,
it subsequently became the basis of
the entire United States Navy radio
communication system during the
j World War. Later, this system be
came the basis of Mackay Radio.
Mr. Elliott was with Federal from
1916 to 1924, where his activities in
cluded design, production engineer
ing and development work, and
consulting engineer for the Chinese
project of Federal and its subsidiary,
the Federal Telegraph Co. of Dela
ware, from 1923 to 1925.
NEW STATIONS ESTABLISHED
After Federal developed the
Navy's communication system, 200
and 500 kilowatt stations were es
tablished at San Diego, Annapolis,
Pearl Harbor, Mare Island, Phila
delphia, and a 1,000 kilowatt station
at Bordeaux in 1917. At the Bor
deaux station, eight self-supporting
towers, 820 feet high, were installed.
These are the highest which have
ever been erected for the purpose,
and gave the Allies radio contact
anywhere in the world.
Hundreds of smaller sending and
! receiving sets for the Navy were de
! signed and materials fabricated and
tested at Federal's Palo Alto home
| plant, and these were installed on
all vessels of the U. S. Navy.
All this before any broadcasting oi
radio as the public knew it!
Mr. Elliott left Federal in 1924 and
until 1927 did development work
and produced a radio receiver, the

patents for which the Victor Talking
Machine Co. and RCA Victor Co.
purchased. These receivers were
put in production in 1929, and
500,000 —a half-million—were built,
half of which are still in service
today.
The receivers sold in one year to
taled a retail value of $70,000,000!
Each of these microsynchronous re
ceiver models cost $200.
From 1931 to the present time Mr.
Elliott has worked in development
and patent activity, specializing in
push-button, remote control and
clock control mechanisms. The
Motorola automobile and home re
ceivers, which he invented, embody
several of these developments.
CLOCK WITH MEMORY
What is perhaps the latest mar
keted development in radio is his—
the clock control mechanism by
which the user can set the clock for
various times during the day, dial
the stations for those times, and sit
hack in his easy chair while the ra
dio automatically turns on and off
the correct stations at the proper
times. He calls it his "clock that
remembers."
Mr. Elliott's Motorola tuning
mechanism which he invented for
the home set and push-button radio
has returned enough capital to pay
for a commodious house and prop
erty on the campus, which he is
planning at present.
During the time he has been
"free-lancing," he has chalked up to
his credit some 15 to 20 patents. He
is also a photography enthusiast and
returned recently from a tour of the
Southwest with some remarkable
scenic studies.
The day that a biographer .sits [
himself down to record the successes i
of outstanding Stanford men and
women, he'll include the name of
Harold F. Elliott.

DEVELOPS TRANSMITTER
During the first World War, Mr.
Elliott was one of several Stanford
men who developed the Poulson arc
from the tiny Danish original to a
mechanism the castings for which
weigh 15 tons each.
The Poulson arc was the first suc
cessful continuous radio wave trans
mitter, and after the American pat
ents had been secured for Federal,
it subsequently became the basis of
the entire United States Navy radio
communication system during the
j World War. Later, this system be
came the basis of Mackay Radio.
Mr. Elliott was with Federal from
1916 to 1924, where his activities in
cluded design, production engineer
ing and development work, and
consulting engineer for the Chinese
project of Federal and its subsidiary,
the Federal Telegraph Co. of Dela
ware, from 1923 to 1925.
NEW STATIONS ESTABLISHED
After Federal developed the
Navy's communication system, 200
and 500 kilowatt stations were es
tablished at San Diego, Annapolis,
Pearl Harbor, Mare Island, Phila
delphia, and a 1,000 kilowatt station
at Bordeaux in 1917. At the Bor
deaux station, eight self-supporting
towers, 820 feet high, were installed.
These are the highest which have
ever been erected for the purpose,
and gave the Allies radio contact
anywhere in the world.
Hundreds of smaller sending and
! receiving sets for the Navy were de
! signed and materials fabricated and
tested at Federal's Palo Alto home
| plant, and these were installed on
all vessels of the U. S. Navy.
All this before any broadcasting oi
radio as the public knew it!
Mr. Elliott left Federal in 1924 and
until 1927 did development work
and produced a radio receiver, the

patents for which the Victor Talking
Machine Co. and RCA Victor Co.
purchased. These receivers were
put in production in 1929, and
500,000 —a half-million—were built,
half of which are still in service
today.
The receivers sold in one year to
taled a retail value of $70,000,000!
Each of these microsynchronous re
ceiver models cost $200.
From 1931 to the present time Mr.
Elliott has worked in development
and patent activity, specializing in
push-button, remote control and
clock control mechanisms. The
Motorola automobile and home re
ceivers, which he invented, embody
several of these developments.
CLOCK WITH MEMORY
What is perhaps the latest mar
keted development in radio is his—
the clock control mechanism by
which the user can set the clock for
various times during the day, dial
the stations for those times, and sit
hack in his easy chair while the ra
dio automatically turns on and off
the correct stations at the proper
times. He calls it his "clock that
remembers."
Mr. Elliott's Motorola tuning
mechanism which he invented for
the home set and push-button radio
has returned enough capital to pay
for a commodious house and prop
erty on the campus, which he is
planning at present.
During the time he has been
"free-lancing," he has chalked up to
his credit some 15 to 20 patents. He
is also a photography enthusiast and

During the time he has been
"free-lancing," he has chalked up to
his credit some 15 to 20 patents. He
is also a photography enthusiast and
returned recently from a tour of the
Southwest with some remarkable
scenic studies.
The day that a biographer .sits [
himself down to record the successes i
of outstanding Stanford men and
women, he'll include the name of
Harold F. Elliott.
And for good reason, for Mr. El
liott, '16, and manager of the '16
Quad, will be featured in the special
engineering issue of the Stanford Il
lustrated Review next month as one
of 22 Stanford engineering graduates
who, for a time, worked for the old
Federal Telegraph Company of Palo
Alto and later became an outstand
ing inventor.
DEVELOPS TRANSMITTER
During the first World War, Mr.
Elliott was one of several Stanford
men who developed the Poulson arc
from the tiny Danish original to a
mechanism the castings for which
weigh 15 tons each.
The Poulson arc was the first suc
cessful continuous radio wave trans
mitter, and after the American pat
ents had been secured for Federal,
it subsequently became the basis of
the entire United States Navy radio
communication system during the
j World War. Later, this system be
came the basis of Mackay Radio.
Mr. Elliott was with Federal from
1916 to 1924, where his activities in
cluded design, production engineer
ing and development work, and
consulting engineer for the Chinese
project of Federal and its subsidiary,
the Federal Telegraph Co. of Dela
ware, from 1923 to 1925.
NEW STATIONS ESTABLISHED
After Federal developed the
Navy's communication system, 200
and 500 kilowatt stations were es
tablished at San Diego, Annapolis,
Pearl Harbor, Mare Island, Phila
delphia, and a 1,000 kilowatt station
at Bordeaux in 1917. At the Bor
deaux station, eight self-supporting
towers, 820 feet high, were installed.
These are the highest which have
ever been erected for the purpose,
and gave the Allies radio contact
anywhere in the world.
Hundreds of smaller sending and
! receiving sets for the Navy were de
! signed and materials fabricated and
tested at Federal's Palo Alto home
| plant, and these were installed on
all vessels of the U. S. Navy.
All this before any broadcasting oi
radio as the public knew it!
Mr. Elliott left Federal in 1924 and
until 1927 did development work
and produced a radio receiver, the

patents for which the Victor Talking
Machine Co. and RCA Victor Co.
purchased. These receivers were
put in production in 1929, and
500,000 —a half-million—were built,
half of which are still in service
today.
The receivers sold in one year to
taled a retail value of $70,000,000!
Each of these microsynchronous re
ceiver models cost $200.
From 1931 to the present time Mr.
Elliott has worked in development
and patent activity, specializing in
push-button, remote control and
clock control mechanisms. The
Motorola automobile and home re
ceivers, which he invented, embody
several of these developments.
CLOCK WITH MEMORY
What is perhaps the latest mar
keted development in radio is his—
the clock control mechanism by
which the user can set the clock for
various times during the day, dial
the stations for those times, and sit
hack in his easy chair while the ra
dio automatically turns on and off
the correct stations at the proper
times. He calls it his "clock that
remembers."
Mr. Elliott's Motorola tuning
mechanism which he invented for
the home set and push-button radio
has returned enough capital to pay
for a commodious house and prop
erty on the campus, which he is
planning at present.
During the time he has been
"free-lancing," he has chalked up to
his credit some 15 to 20 patents. He
is also a photography enthusiast and
returned recently from a tour of the
Southwest with some remarkable
scenic studies.
