# Farm Debaters Meet Today In Finals for Campus Title
## 
### 
Two Stanford debate teams will
clash today in the final round of
the third annual Delta Sigma Rho
all-University tournament. The
championship debate is scheduled
for 4:15 o'clock in the Little Theater
of Memorial Hall.
Both teams fought their way to
the final match through a series of
Delta Sigma Rho elimination de
bates held throughout autumn quar
ter. Jim Kessler and Jack Webster
will face a team composed of Colin
McClintock and John Pollock.
The question will be "Resolved:
that the nations of the Western
Hemisphere should form a perma
nent union." Winners of the Uni
vex*sity Championship will i-eceive
the Delta Sigma Rho trophy, and
will be sent to Marin County where
they will meet the San Quentin
Prison debate team.
The San Quentin match has been
held eight times, Stanford winning
five of the matches, and San Quentin

three. Judges for the prison debate
are usually prominent lawyers and
teachers from San Francisco. The
San Quentin debate will probably be
held near the middle of February.
Judges of the debate today will be
Dr. L. T. Chapin, debate coach; Dr.
J. G. Emerson, professor of public
speaking; and Dr. H. C. Heffner,
head of the public speaking depart
ment.
Dr. Chapin, who acted as judge in
some of the earlier fall matches de
clared, "The four debaters who are
participating today have been work
ing hard for a long t.ime, and will
give an excellent debate no matter
which side wins."
The debate will be one hour long,
and Milton Marks, president of the
national honorary debate fraternity
will act as chairman. Winners of the
contest will become members of the
varsity debate squad next year.
Last year's contest was won by
Roger Boas and George Jackson.
