Bad weather again hindered search

plane, missing with seven men
aboard since last Thursday some
where between Tacoma, Wash., and
Sacramento.
McChord Field headquarters, Ta
coma, unable to get searching planes
off the ground because of fog and
poor visibility, set up a camp at Ar
lington, Ore., from where 100 men
and eight planes will direct an ex
tensive search over the mountains
of southern Washington, Oregon,
and northern California.
