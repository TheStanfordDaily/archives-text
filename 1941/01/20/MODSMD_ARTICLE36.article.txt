# Cagers Cop Troy Series
## Cards Annex Pair to Lead Conference 
### DON SELBY 
Chalk up a pair of wins for those
up ami coming Indian cagers!
For in their first time out against
conference competition this season,
Coach Everett Dean's buys jumped
into the Southern Division lead
with Friday and Saturday night vic
tories over U.S.C., the defending
champions, by scores of 43-37 and
3fl-34, respectively.
As is usually the case in these
two-night conference stands, the
second game of the U.S. ' ■ Stanford
series was deride Uv slow •' than the
opener. U.S.C. is typic.J the type
of team that wears down its oppo
nent in the first night's contest in
hopes of rolling to an easy victory
over a weary foe on the next night.
But the Trojans were licked at their
own game this week-end, for they
were just as tired Saturday night as
the Indians were. And Stanford had
the class to come through Saturday
night while the Trojans didn't.
LAST-MINUTE RALLY
Friday night saw Stanford jump
into an early lead which they re
fused to relinquish during the en
tire encounter, repelling a last
minute U.S.C. rally which brought
the Trojans to within three points of
the flying Indians. Just when it
looked as if the men from Troy
might be getting into the old ball
game, Bill Cowden dropped through
a free throw and Fordy Anderson
added a field goal, stretching the
Card lead to the six-point margin of
victory.
The second game was one of the
roughest, dirtiest contests seen in
the Pavilion in some time as Offi
icals Lloyd Leith and Ernie Bailly
blew their whistles for 42 fouls.
Stanford's Don Burness and U.S.C.'s
Jack Barron and Bob Matthews were
tossed out of the game on four fouls
apiece.

Following Berg's 20-foot field
goal with seven minutes to go in
the first half, U.S.C. suffered a field
goal drought which lasted for about
five minutes before Berg again tal
lied. In the meantime Stanford
didn't fare too well either, David
son's two field goals and Burness's
free throw being the total of Stan
ford scoring. But Davidson whipped
through a one-hander from ten
feet out just before the gun to give
the Cards a six-point lead at 18-12
at the intermission.
Throughout the second half the
Trojans matched Stanford point for
point, and although the margin of
lead occasionally varied, Stanford
ford was usually six points ahead
until Guard Johnny Luber put
through a free throw that brought
Troy's final total to 34 points, just
live short of Stanford's 39.

Following Berg's 20-foot field

five minutes before Berg again tal

Chalk up a pair of wins for those
up ami coming Indian cagers!
For in their first time out against
conference competition this season,
Coach Everett Dean's buys jumped
into the Southern Division lead
with Friday and Saturday night vic
tories over U.S.C., the defending
champions, by scores of 43-37 and
3fl-34, respectively.
As is usually the case in these
two-night conference stands, the
second game of the U.S. ' ■ Stanford
series was deride Uv slow •' than the
opener. U.S.C. is typic.J the type
of team that wears down its oppo
nent in the first night's contest in
hopes of rolling to an easy victory
over a weary foe on the next night.
But the Trojans were licked at their
own game this week-end, for they
were just as tired Saturday night as
the Indians were. And Stanford had
the class to come through Saturday
night while the Trojans didn't.
LAST-MINUTE RALLY
Friday night saw Stanford jump
into an early lead which they re
fused to relinquish during the en
tire encounter, repelling a last
minute U.S.C. rally which brought
the Trojans to within three points of
the flying Indians. Just when it
looked as if the men from Troy
might be getting into the old ball
game, Bill Cowden dropped through
a free throw and Fordy Anderson
added a field goal, stretching the
Card lead to the six-point margin of
victory.
The second game was one of the
roughest, dirtiest contests seen in
the Pavilion in some time as Offi
icals Lloyd Leith and Ernie Bailly
blew their whistles for 42 fouls.
Stanford's Don Burness and U.S.C.'s
Jack Barron and Bob Matthews were
tossed out of the game on four fouls
apiece.
CAN'T HIT lIOOP
Following Berg's 20-foot field
goal with seven minutes to go in
the first half, U.S.C. suffered a field
goal drought which lasted for about
five minutes before Berg again tal
lied. In the meantime Stanford
didn't fare too well either, David
son's two field goals and Burness's
free throw being the total of Stan
ford scoring. But Davidson whipped
through a one-hander from ten
feet out just before the gun to give
the Cards a six-point lead at 18-12
at the intermission.
Throughout the second half the
Trojans matched Stanford point for
point, and although the margin of
lead occasionally varied, Stanford
ford was usually six points ahead
until Guard Johnny Luber put
through a free throw that brought
Troy's final total to 34 points, just
live short of Stanford's 39.
