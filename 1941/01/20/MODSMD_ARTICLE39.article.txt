# University Club Ruggers Push Indians to 11-11 Tie
## 
### 
Scoring 11 points in the first period, the Stanford varsity rugby squad
was unable to break the ice during the second half and was tied 11-11 by
the University Club fifteen last Saturday afternoon.
Sensing at the end of the first period that they were in possession of a
commanding lead, the Indians were badly fooled when the Clubbers came
back in the second half to tie , ——

score.
Stanford gave its followers a great
deal to look forward to because of
their sterling, and at times brilliant,
play during the opening period. Tak
ing the ball down the field in a
series of rushes, the Cards scored
and converted early in the game to
give them a 5-0 lead and were never
headed from that time until the half
time gun went off. During this pe
riod tries were made by Ted Cole,
Roger Laverty and George Jedenoff,
while Cam Pierce made the lone
conversion.
EXPERIENCE SHOWS
The greater experience of the
clubmen paid dividends during the
second half when they took advan
tage of all their breaks to tie the
score. The final three points were
made by Hickey Barry as he scored
a try which came after the final gun
but before the ball had been
grounded. Stanford had eased up, j
and their comparatively green squad
was unable to cope with the way in
which the clubmen gained control
of the ball at crucial times.
The jayvee game with Menlo
Junior College ended in a 3-0 vic
tory for Stanford, in spite of rather
ragged playing by both teams. It
was rather hard to single out any
one player for praise in this contest,
due to the universal lack of expe
rience. The scoring was done on a
free kick by A1 Cole.
COACHES PLEASED
In both games Stanford showed the
effects of only having had three
afternoons of practice. However, the
coaching staff was well pleased with
the results obtained and is looking
forward to being able to field two
good squads every week.
Tentatively scheduled for this
Saturday is a game with the Olympic
Club, the strongest team in the Rug

by Union. At a meeting to be held
in San Francisco tonight the final
schedules for the season will be |
made up, and at this time the tilt ]
will undoubtedly be arranged.

EXPERIENCE SHOWS
The greater experience of the
clubmen paid dividends during the
second half when they took advan
tage of all their breaks to tie the
score. The final three points were
made by Hickey Barry as he scored
a try which came after the final gun
but before the ball had been
grounded. Stanford had eased up, j
and their comparatively green squad
was unable to cope with the way in
which the clubmen gained control
of the ball at crucial times.
The jayvee game with Menlo
Junior College ended in a 3-0 vic
tory for Stanford, in spite of rather
ragged playing by both teams. It
was rather hard to single out any
one player for praise in this contest,
due to the universal lack of expe
rience. The scoring was done on a
free kick by A1 Cole.
COACHES PLEASED
In both games Stanford showed the
effects of only having had three
afternoons of practice. However, the
coaching staff was well pleased with
the results obtained and is looking
forward to being able to field two
good squads every week.
Tentatively scheduled for this
Saturday is a game with the Olympic
Club, the strongest team in the Rug

by Union. At a meeting to be held
in San Francisco tonight the final
schedules for the season will be |
made up, and at this time the tilt ]
will undoubtedly be arranged.
Scoring 11 points in the first period, the Stanford varsity rugby squad
was unable to break the ice during the second half and was tied 11-11 by
the University Club fifteen last Saturday afternoon.
Sensing at the end of the first period that they were in possession of a
commanding lead, the Indians were badly fooled when the Clubbers came
back in the second half to tie , ——

score.
Stanford gave its followers a great
deal to look forward to because of
their sterling, and at times brilliant,
play during the opening period. Tak
ing the ball down the field in a
series of rushes, the Cards scored
and converted early in the game to
give them a 5-0 lead and were never
headed from that time until the half
time gun went off. During this pe
riod tries were made by Ted Cole,
Roger Laverty and George Jedenoff,
while Cam Pierce made the lone
conversion.
