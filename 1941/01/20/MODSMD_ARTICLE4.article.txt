# Quad Sets Deadline For Pledge Pictures
## 
### 
Fraternity and sorority pledges
may have their pictures taken this
week and the early part of next
week if they wish to appear in the
1941 Quad. All other organization
people who have not as yet had
their pictures taken may also do so
at this time. According to Charles
Runacres, '41 editor, this will be ab
solutely the last time that the studio
will be open for individual pictures.
Students should make their ap
pointments immediately at the Quad
office, preferably for the morning,
when service is more prompt. Stu
dents are requested not to fail to
keep their appointments.
