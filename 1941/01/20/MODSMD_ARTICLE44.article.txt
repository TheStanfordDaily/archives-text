DISSATISFACTION with Stanford's sorority
system has again popped out of hiding this
week-end. It's the first time since the famous
Roble Revolt of 1938 that the campus in general
has had a glimpse of the inner mechanism of
the pledging system —and has discovered that
all is not sweetness and light, even among the
sisters.
Pan-hellenic has meted out slight penalties
and will pursue its investigation again today.
And the individuals who should cry the most
are those few freshman women who won't be
permitted to pledge until spring—because they
were penalized for the faults of a machine in
which their finges were unwittingly caught.
It is safe to say that this year's revelation of
unethical rushing methods depicted an annual
situation. Violations were probably no more
flagrant than usual; they were merely detected
and discussed by a group of people who, three
years ago, couldn't quite stand the stench of the
sorority set-up. They couldn't stand it again in
1941.
It is a source of amazement to a great many
people that Stanford should tolerate the exist
ence of the present method of women's rushing
and pledging. The women's living-group ar
rangement is so full of flaws, so full of elements
that are undemocratic and in complete negation
of all the ideals of the University that it is un
believable that it should continue to exist.
It seems possible to solve the problem in one
of two ways:
1. Create a sufficient number of sororities so
that all women who choose may pledge one,
instead of allowing only one-third to join.
2. Abolish sororities completely and turn so
rority houses into small women's living groups.
The latter plan is by far the more desirable,
for the essential difficulty with the present sys
tem is internal. The idea of a small group,
fairly closely knit, is not fundamentally bad.
But the outside influence of alumnae, the bar
ring of women because of religious or economic
reasons, and the high-pressure ushing methods
are all faults that center in undemocracy and,
when extended, tend to create a pseudo-aris
tocracy that should have no place in the Uni
versity family.
If recurrences of this week-end's troubled
pledging follow from year to year, it is con
ceivable that Stanford sororities will go. The
tendency is in that direction. And the faster
the pace, the better.
