# The 						Road to War

\\n~>HE weary men are marching down the
X road tonight," says Raymond E. Manches
ter, Dean of Men of Kent State University at
Kent, Ohio.
In one of his series of weekly communica
tions, which are known as "The Saturday Let
ter," he uses this phrase with dramatic impact to
describe the soldiery of Europe, and the future
(when the war is terminated) of those who will
be "left living there to breathe the stench of
frightful carnage born of hate."
But, because of happenings in this country
over the past few months, few people would
miss the implication if Mr. Manchester's phras
ing were changed slightly to say:
"The excitable (deluded, hysterical, patriotic
any of these adjectives could be used here,
depending upon the convictions of the indi
vidual) men are marching down the road to
night."
As the United States drives closer to total
fulfillment of its "all aid to Britain" platform,
those marching feet seem to be coming closer
and closer. The inference to be drawn from the
re-phrasing of Mr. Manchester's sentence is that
instead of it being the European who is march
ing alone, America is forming its battalions.
Such a thing cannot be pointed out as a
definite fact, but notice the direction of Amer
ica's present policies—and notice the mounting
spirit of our civilian population.
A recent Gallup poll showed that 60 per cent
of Americans are favorable to the President's
"all aid" platform, no matter what the conse
quences. Note closely the italics.
Last Saturday morning two American sailors
pulled off the spectacular feat of climbing out
side a semi-skyscraper building in San Fran
cisco and ripping to shreds a Nazi swastika.
Some three thousand persons stood in the street
below, the great majority of them applauding
the act, which certainly is a flagrant breach of
international etiquette, considering the fact that
this country still retains full diplomatic inter
course with Germany.
In an official release, the Navy Department
explains that the two sailors responsible for the
act had recently been released from the Naval

Hospital and were soon to be discharged from
the service.
But while the Navy Department can attempt
to explain away the sailors' actions as the results
of irresponsible mentalities, and while the State
Department in Washington can apologize to
the German Embassy, no power in the country
can explain or apologize for 3,000 civilians
standing in a San Francisco street screaming
"Tear it down," nor can any official exchange
erase the fact that 60 per cent of the American
people favor aid to Britain no matter what the
consequences.
It is but a brief step from the San Francisco
incident to one similar to the scene in Baltimore,
Maryland, some twenty-four years ago when
David Starr Jordan was stoned by a rioting mob
while he was in the midst of a speech denounc
ing war.
This writer has no editorial comment to make,
other than that he believes the observations he
has made constitute a definite trend. Like
everyone else, he has his own ideas as to the
events occurring in the United States at present.
But he does believe that all one has to do is
read the subtle propaganda being released ev
ery day in the newspapers of the nation, take
notice of civilian opinion, and lastly, follow our
"hemispherical defense" preparations, to read
striking truth into the sentence:
"The (excitable, deluded, etc.) men are march
ing down the road tonight."—G. M.
