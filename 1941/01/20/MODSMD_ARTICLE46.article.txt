know that old rushing talk. You sweeten
everything up, dust off all the good looking house
members, cut house bills, temporarily, by at least $10,
and then in your sweetest Listerined breath you say:
''Now what you want in a house is a congenial
group to live with. Alter all, just because the Umpty-
Pumps across the street have got a lot of big names
in their house, doesn't mean you will be happy there.
You're making a decision of whom you're going to
live with for the next three years.
"What you want is a congenial group."
And then everybody nods. And then the rushee
isn't sure. And then everybody holds her (or him)
down. And then the rushee decides that taking the
pledge pin would be the best idea—for a while, any
way.

B UT out of this past week of catch-as-catch-can
has come *a story concerning "that dirty, dirty
women's rushing" which makes you wonder.
This concerns one of those sororities which did a
bad thing. They must be a congenial group.
It all happened down at one of the local drop-in
pass-out pubs where an active sorority woman was
putting the business to a not-so-starry-eyed Roble
woman. What d'ya say, asks the Row woman. Nope,
says the Roble gal. And so it see-saws back and
forth, yes, no, yes, no, have another short one, yes, no.
Well, the whole running dog fight ended up, of all
places, in the Women's rest room—always spelled with
a capital W. What a congenial group! But still the
Roble woman said no. So the 'Row woman flung her
frail and desperate body across the door in best
Olivia DeHaviland style, thus blocking the only exit.
And there they stayed, locked in the women's rest
room for 45 minutes, arguing it out.
Now there would be a good house to join. What
atmosphere, what class, what a swell rushing set-up.
Exclusive, anyway.
* * * *
AND now let's jump to another subject. It's a sub
ject of vital interest.
As you know, during the past weeks you have
discovered the things that your campus leaders have
been doing behind the drawn curtains. But never
has anything spotty or shady been discovered within
the Administration itself. That is, not until a few
minutes ago when one of the Farm's secret agents
came rushing up with this bit of news which will age
you 15 years, which will, undoubtedly, send you to
an early grave.
Your Dean of Men has committed a hideous crime!
Yes, last Saturday, right here on the campus, he
drove through a stop sign. It wasn't a new sign; it's
been there for years. Your dean was on familiar
ground. And yet, he drove right through.
But he was discovered. People like that always
are. There always is some weak link in the perfect
crime. In this case it was an eye witness.
And to make things worse, when he discovered that
somebody had witnessed the violation your dean turned
his face away to escape identity. But it was too late.
Too late. Things like that just can't be undone in a
moment. The deed was done. There's only one thing
left to do—call Gordy the Cop.

AND now let's jump to another subject. It's a sub
ject of vital interest.
As you know, during the past weeks you have
discovered the things that your campus leaders have
been doing behind the drawn curtains. But never
has anything spotty or shady been discovered within
the Administration itself. That is, not until a few
minutes ago when one of the Farm's secret agents
came rushing up with this bit of news which will age
you 15 years, which will, undoubtedly, send you to
an early grave.
Your Dean of Men has committed a hideous crime!
Yes, last Saturday, right here on the campus, he
drove through a stop sign. It wasn't a new sign; it's
been there for years. Your dean was on familiar
ground. And yet, he drove right through.
But he was discovered. People like that always
are. There always is some weak link in the perfect
crime. In this case it was an eye witness.
And to make things worse, when he discovered that
somebody had witnessed the violation your dean turned
his face away to escape identity. But it was too late.
Too late. Things like that just can't be undone in a
moment. The deed was done. There's only one thing
left to do—call Gordy the Cop.

TALE OF TWO TIDBITS
know that old rushing talk. You sweeten
everything up, dust off all the good looking house
members, cut house bills, temporarily, by at least $10,
and then in your sweetest Listerined breath you say:
''Now what you want in a house is a congenial
group to live with. Alter all, just because the Umpty-
Pumps across the street have got a lot of big names
in their house, doesn't mean you will be happy there.
You're making a decision of whom you're going to
live with for the next three years.
"What you want is a congenial group."
And then everybody nods. And then the rushee
isn't sure. And then everybody holds her (or him)
down. And then the rushee decides that taking the
pledge pin would be the best idea—for a while, any
way.

B UT out of this past week of catch-as-catch-can
has come *a story concerning "that dirty, dirty
women's rushing" which makes you wonder.
This concerns one of those sororities which did a
bad thing. They must be a congenial group.
It all happened down at one of the local drop-in
pass-out pubs where an active sorority woman was
putting the business to a not-so-starry-eyed Roble
woman. What d'ya say, asks the Row woman. Nope,
says the Roble gal. And so it see-saws back and
forth, yes, no, yes, no, have another short one, yes, no.
Well, the whole running dog fight ended up, of all
places, in the Women's rest room—always spelled with
a capital W. What a congenial group! But still the
Roble woman said no. So the 'Row woman flung her
frail and desperate body across the door in best
Olivia DeHaviland style, thus blocking the only exit.
And there they stayed, locked in the women's rest
room for 45 minutes, arguing it out.
