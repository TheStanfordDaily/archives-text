CONCERNING FOREIGN POLICY

HPHE EDITOR, SIR:
For the past few months I have been reading
Bob Low's article in The Stanford Daily. For some
reason, whether it be selfish or altruistic, he has
jumped on the wagon and shouted, "Britain is the
last stronghold of democracy" or "this war is that of
a democratic people against a totalitarian state" or
better still "a war of democracy against fascism." If
this were a war exclusively of the English people
against the controlled machine of Hitler I would be
on the next bale of cotton to England. But there is
more to this picture than has been painted by either
Mr. Low or the other columnists.
Why are such appeasers as Lord Lothian, Lord
Halifax, and Sir Samuel Hoare allowed to hold such
important diplomatic posts? If Churchill is the enemy
of appeasement why did he retain Chamberlain in his
cabinet until he died and why was he against help to
Republican Spain? Our own Ambassador Kennedy
when asked if England was fighting for democracy an
swered thualy, "That's the bunk." (Interview in the
Boston Globe.)
I wish to say that the data collected here docs not
prove anything one way or the other. It merely sug
gests that possibly our support of Britain with either
goods or men may not be the best policy for preserv
ing democracy in the world nor the best policy for
crushing Fascism or Communism. The San Francisco
Examiner has time and again warned that while the
Allies and the Fascists expend their energies that
Russia is expanding her military might, is enjoying a
profitable trade, and she becomes more powerful while
the democracies become weaker and weaker. By send
ing our necessary armaments and foodstuffs to England
we might possibly be cutting our own throats and
hamstringing democracy for all time.
K I. M.
