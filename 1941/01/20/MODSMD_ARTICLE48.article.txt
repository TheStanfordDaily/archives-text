# 'Santa Fe Trail' Reflects Slavery Issue in Kansas
## 
### 
"Santa Fe Trail," starring Krrol
Flynn and Olivia dc llaviland,
with Raymond Massey and Ron
ald Reagan
Don't let the title scare you away
from this one, thinking it's another
one of those cowboy and Indian
things—if you do you'll miss a really
fine historical film. The title is only
a camouflage—or perhaps it was
tagged onto the picture by mistake—
anyway the story deals with the
free-slave issue prior to the Civil
War, and almost completely ignores
the Trail.
Without the usual trumpery and
bombast of historical spectacles, this
picture turns a searchlight on that
dark decade that preceded the out
break of the War of Emancipation.
With restraint and impartiality it
illustrates the febrile agonies of a
nation torn between two factions.
John brown Revolt
The searchlight throws into relief
one phase of the struggle, that of the
movement led by John Brown and
his followers, which becomes a re
flection of all the currents and cross
currents that buffeted the nation.
The thread of the narrative is
picked up at West Point, 1854, when
seven of the outstanding members of
the graduating class are ordered to
the suicide station of Leavenworth,
Kansas, as punishment for engaging
in a brawl over the abolitionist issue.
The seven include J. E. B. Stuart
(Errol Flynn), George Custer (Ron
ald Reagan), Phil Sheridan, and oth
ers before their friendship was shat
tered by the Civil War. They no
sooner arrive at the farthest western
army outpost in the Union, than they
come to grips with John Brown
(Raymond Massey), then engaged
in making "bloody Kansas" a little
more gory.
BONE OF CONTENTION
Kansas, then enjoying only the
status of a territory, was the focal
point of the free-slave issue, with
each faction trying to bring Kansas
into the Union on its side.
Here it is that John Brown, the
impassioned zealot, is engaged in
bushwhacking activities seeking to
force the issue to decision—a deci
sion which he feels can be decided
only by blood. The character of
Brown and his ideals are relent
lessly torn from their sentimental
shroud, to stand forth in a cold and
penetrating glare.

John Brown in this light becomes
no legend-hallowed martyr, but an
uncompromising fanatic, who recog
nizes no law but the law of God as
interpreted by John Brown. The
film courageously shows Brown as a
warped crusader so intent on a prin
ciple that he has lost all human
feelings.
MASSEY STARS
Raymond Massey's characterization
is of such dimensions that it all but
obscures the work of the other ac
tors. However, Errol Flynn as hand
some daredevil Jeb Stuart is at his
best — the gallant officer, without
overdoing the swagger. Olivia de
Havilland is as appealing as always,
here providing an object of rivalry
between Custer and Stuart.
It's the direction and the beauti
fully clearly stale- screen story that
make the picture the excellent docu
ment that it is. Warner Brothers set
a new standard in historical cinema
tography that many other studios
could do well to emulate.
The companion feature is "Gal
lant Sons," a murder mystery ap
parently designed to give work to
some veteran child actors. The plot
is a little thin in spots, and the kid
could almost say precocious, but it's
dies are a bit too resourceful—one
moderately entertaining and not
cloyingly cute.—Douglass
