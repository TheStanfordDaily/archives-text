Robert Casadesus, born and educated in France, has now adopted

Francisco Symphony Orchestra a
few seasons back, he was received
with great applause by the San
Francisco audience.
His program for this evening will
be a varied one drawing from the
wox-ks of old masters and moderns
alike, including the following se
lections:
VARIED PROGRAM
Schubert's "Sonata in A Major,
Opus 120" in three movements; the
"Sonata in F Minor, Opus 57," com
monly known as Appassionata, by
Beethoven; "Papillons, Opus 2" by
Schumann; Chopin's "Scherzo, Opus
39" in C sharp minor; "Sonatine," in
three movements by Maurice Ravel;
and "Bourree Fantasque," by Chab
rier.
Though Casadesus (pronounced
Ka-zuh-deh-su) is also a composer
of no small note, he will not include
any of his own works in the pro
gram. He considers this merely a
hobby. His works include chamber
music as well as larger composi
tions for piano and symphony or
chestra.
BORN IN PARIS
Casadesus was born in Paris in
1899 of a family of international mu
sical reputation. He was a pupil of
Diemer at the Paris Conservatoire,
and won the Conservatoire's first
prize in 1913. In Europe and Amer
ica alike, he is considered one of
the foremost pianists of the day.
Since his American debut in 1935
he has played here regularly in
solo recitals and with leading
American orchestras, winning great
er favor with each successive con
cert appearance.
The pianist has just completed an
album of recordings of works by
Ravel, whom he admires profoundly,
and who had been his close friend.
