# Philosopher Talks On Biblical Love
## 
### 
"The More Excellent Way" was
the topic of yesterday's sermon at
the Stanford Memorial Chapel. Dr.
Rufus Jones, renowned professor of
philosophy at Haverford College, de
livered a dissertation on the way St.
Paul introduces his great, chapter
on love.
"There are (wo words explaining
love," the philosopher said, "that are
mentioned continually in religious
history.*' He explained one as
"Agape." from St. Paul's doctrine,
interpreting it as "love coming down
from above and seeking after us."
Dr. Jones pointed out the other
word, "Eros," which is contained in
Plato's teachings. He said that this
represented tlove as "the way down
and the way up."
A large audience included many
fraternity men and sorority women
who joined their pledges in front of
the chapel to attend services.
