HITLER and Benito Mus
solini met for the fifth time yes
terday, presumably somewhere in
Germany.
On four previous occasions since
the war started, meetings of these
two men have been followed by
new, unexpected acts by the Axis
powers.
Speculation the world over today
is centered about what new devel
opments may be expected as a re
sult of this conference.
The Nazi government released
only one short communique about
the meeting of Hitler and Musso
lini, and that was anything but in
formative as to the decisions
reached. The official report said:
"At a meeting attended l»y the
Axis foreign ministers, Hitler and
II I)ucc had an intensive discus
sion in the spirit of cordial friend
ship between the two heads of
government and in the close com
radeship of battle between the
German and Italian peoples. It re
sulted in complete agreements of
views on all questions."
Complete secrecy surrounded the
meeting and barely an hour and a
half before this official communique
was made public, an authorized gov
ernment spokesman denied any
knowledge of the meeting.
"I know absolutely nothing about
any meeting or conference," he said.
"I deny that such a meeting has
taken place."
So it is against the background of
this secrecy and with the knowledge
of what has followed Hitler-Musso
lini talks in the past that observers
speculate on the next Axis move.

authoritative German
k papers were bold in their pre
dictions and pointed out results of
the previous meetings between the
two men:
"The year 1939 brought eradica
tion of the Polish disturber of the
peace," one paper said.
"The year 1940 brought the
crushing of the last continental op
ponent of the Axis—France.
'The year 1941 will crown the
string of victories with the blow of
destruction against England."
The same paper referred to the
British successes in the Mediterra
nean (in Albania and in North Af
rica) as "only on the fringe of the
real events of the war."
The French campaign, the paper
said, had strengthened the German
thesis of careful, long-prepared
plans followed by a "swift and thor
ough triumph."
"Once again the world stands on
the brink of historic events, which
always since the entrance of Italy
into the war have been indicated by
the meetings between the Fuehrer
and II Duce."
These statements typify those
coming from the controlled press
since the official communique was
released.

the German people
are being told that something
big is about to be brought off. These
comments come from the Nazi propa
ganda machine and are primarily for
home consumption.
It is not probable that the Ger
mans are merely trying to shatter
the nerves of their enemies, for
the German people themselves are
being led to expect new victories.
Neither the leadership of Germany
nor of Italy can afford "to let their
people down" at this time.
The prestige of Mussolini both
with his own people and with the
peoples of other countries has not
been enhanced by the defeats of
Fascist Legions in Albania and in
North Africa.
And, too, Hitler's position of re
spect among his people depends to
some extent upon the ability of Mus
solini to restore confidence in his
regime, for it cannot be forgotten
that Hitler and Mussolini are allies,
supposedly cordial friends, fighting a
common enemy.
Hitler cannot permit his Axis
partner to suffer further humilia
tion.
Whatever Hitler and Mussolini
have in store for the world is not
known, but one likelihood is that
Hitler will take steps to pull Italy
out of a bad situation.

the German people
are being told that something
big is about to be brought off. These
comments come from the Nazi propa
ganda machine and are primarily for
home consumption.
It is not probable that the Ger
mans are merely trying to shatter
the nerves of their enemies, for
the German people themselves are
being led to expect new victories.
Neither the leadership of Germany
nor of Italy can afford "to let their
people down" at this time.
The prestige of Mussolini both
with his own people and with the
peoples of other countries has not
been enhanced by the defeats of
Fascist Legions in Albania and in
North Africa.
And, too, Hitler's position of re
spect among his people depends to
some extent upon the ability of Mus
solini to restore confidence in his
regime, for it cannot be forgotten
that Hitler and Mussolini are allies,
supposedly cordial friends, fighting a
common enemy.
Hitler cannot permit his Axis
partner to suffer further humilia
tion.
Whatever Hitler and Mussolini
have in store for the world is not
known, but one likelihood is that
Hitler will take steps to pull Italy
out of a bad situation.
HITLER and Benito Mus
solini met for the fifth time yes
terday, presumably somewhere in
Germany.
On four previous occasions since
the war started, meetings of these
two men have been followed by
new, unexpected acts by the Axis
powers.
Speculation the world over today
is centered about what new devel
opments may be expected as a re
sult of this conference.
The Nazi government released
only one short communique about
the meeting of Hitler and Musso
lini, and that was anything but in
formative as to the decisions
reached. The official report said:
"At a meeting attended l»y the
Axis foreign ministers, Hitler and
II I)ucc had an intensive discus
sion in the spirit of cordial friend
ship between the two heads of
government and in the close com
radeship of battle between the
German and Italian peoples. It re
sulted in complete agreements of
views on all questions."
Complete secrecy surrounded the
meeting and barely an hour and a
half before this official communique
was made public, an authorized gov
ernment spokesman denied any
knowledge of the meeting.
"I know absolutely nothing about
any meeting or conference," he said.
"I deny that such a meeting has
taken place."
So it is against the background of
this secrecy and with the knowledge
of what has followed Hitler-Musso
lini talks in the past that observers
speculate on the next Axis move.

knowledge of the meeting.
"I know absolutely nothing about
any meeting or conference," he said.
"I deny that such a meeting has
taken place."
So it is against the background of
this secrecy and with the knowledge
of what has followed Hitler-Musso
lini talks in the past that observers
speculate on the next Axis move.

authoritative German
k papers were bold in their pre
dictions and pointed out results of
the previous meetings between the
two men:
"The year 1939 brought eradica
tion of the Polish disturber of the
peace," one paper said.
"The year 1940 brought the
crushing of the last continental op
ponent of the Axis—France.
'The year 1941 will crown the
string of victories with the blow of
destruction against England."
The same paper referred to the
British successes in the Mediterra
nean (in Albania and in North Af
rica) as "only on the fringe of the
real events of the war."
The French campaign, the paper
said, had strengthened the German
thesis of careful, long-prepared
plans followed by a "swift and thor
ough triumph."
"Once again the world stands on
the brink of historic events, which
always since the entrance of Italy
into the war have been indicated by
the meetings between the Fuehrer
and II Duce."
These statements typify those
coming from the controlled press
since the official communique was
released.

the German people
are being told that something
big is about to be brought off. These
comments come from the Nazi propa
ganda machine and are primarily for
home consumption.
It is not probable that the Ger
mans are merely trying to shatter
the nerves of their enemies, for
the German people themselves are
being led to expect new victories.
Neither the leadership of Germany
nor of Italy can afford "to let their
people down" at this time.
The prestige of Mussolini both
with his own people and with the
peoples of other countries has not
been enhanced by the defeats of
Fascist Legions in Albania and in
North Africa.
And, too, Hitler's position of re
spect among his people depends to
some extent upon the ability of Mus
solini to restore confidence in his
regime, for it cannot be forgotten
that Hitler and Mussolini are allies,
supposedly cordial friends, fighting a
common enemy.
Hitler cannot permit his Axis
partner to suffer further humilia
tion.
Whatever Hitler and Mussolini
have in store for the world is not
known, but one likelihood is that
Hitler will take steps to pull Italy
out of a bad situation.
