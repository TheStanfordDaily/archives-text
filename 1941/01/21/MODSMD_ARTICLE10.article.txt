# 'Dimes March' Finds Wrench In Machinery
## 
### 
The March oi Dimes suffered a
slight loss when two of its boxes
were torn open and rifled by an
unknown person, it was discovered
early last night. Since the boxes
had been emptied freoucntly, it is
believed that the total amount taken
was not over $2. A box in Lagunita
is suspected to have lost about $1
in the same manner.
A $5 bill was collected from the
box in the Union Cellar, the gift of
an anonymous person.
Also, the name of the Firehouse
was added to the 100 per cent honor
roll yesterday with the discovery
that their donation had amounted to
100 per cent since last Wednesday.
Delta Gamma and Madrono living
club added their names to the con
stantly growing list, leaving only
seven fraternities and three sorori
ties yet to be added. Encina has
earned a standing of nearly 100 per
cent, having given up to now over
$42.
Only one eating club has responded
and the others are urged to add
their names promptly.
The drive draws to a close today,
and tomorrow morning will see the
complete honor roll and total of the
drive appearing in the Daily. Alpha
Phi Omega, sponsors of the drive,
are hoping that the total amount of
money will reach $250.
It is not too late to join the March
for aid to infantile paralysis victims.
