NEW YORK, Jan. 20 (UP). â€”
Stocks fell off irregularly today to
around the lowest levels of the year
in the dullest trading in nearly four
months.
Another new record high for
steel operations failed to stimulate
interest in the list. Only 380,000
shares were traded on the "big
board," the smallest total since last
Oct. 1 when 370,00 were turned
over.
