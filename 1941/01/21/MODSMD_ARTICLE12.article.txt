# Rams to Read 'Gentle People'
## Student Dramatists To Present New Show 
### 
"The Gentle People,' a play by
Irwin Shaw, is to be read Friday
night at 8:15 o'clock in the Little
Theater Memorial Hall. Ram's
Head, student dramatic organiza
tion, has announced a new admis
sion price of 15 cents.
"It's the first full-length play by
the newest significant author in the
theater," Tad Marcuse, Ram's Head
reading director, said yesterday,
"and, since the department is end
ing its 50 years of drama festival
with S. N. Behrman, we thought
we'd go a step further."
The play, termed by the author a
"Brooklyn Fable," is the story of
two gentle old men and a girl, who
inadvertently become involved with
a racketeer. With Franchot Tone,
Sylvia Sidfiney, Sam Jaffe, and Elia
Kazan in the leading roles, "The
Gentle People" played a full season
on Broadway.
Irwin Shaw burst on the New
York play writing scene a few years
ago when his startling one-act play,
"Bury the Dead," won him interna
tional recognition. He was 23 at the
time it was first produced.
