### 
ATHENS. Jan. 20 (UP).â€”Destruc
tion of an Italian submarine in the
Mediterranean was reported by the
Greek Admiralty tonight, following
a Fascist air attack on the port of
Athens and reports of an impending
enemy offensive in Albania of "new
nnd daring" character.
British and Italian planes battled
in the sky over the port of Piraeus,
which was bombed, and a Royal Air
Force communique reported one of
the Fascist raiders was shot down
in flames, while a British plane
crashed in landing and burst into
flame.
