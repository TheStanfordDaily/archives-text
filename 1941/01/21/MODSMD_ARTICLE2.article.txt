# Third Term Is Dedicated To 'American Democracy'
## Over 100,000 Hear President Warn 'All Sacrifice' Needed for Defense 
### 
WASHING lON, Jan. 20 (UP). â€”President Roosevelt today dedicated his
precedent-shattering third term to the preservation of democracy and
vigorously rejected the belief of some that "tyranny and slavery" will
dominate the world of tomorrow.
Before 100,000 persons massed in the east plaza of the Capitol to sec

him inducted into office again, the<
President warned "great perils never
before encountered" face democracy
today, and said the perpetuation of
freedom and liberty furnishes high
est justification for every sacrifice
made in the cause of national de
fense.
MUST GO FORWARD
"For this we must muster the
spirit of America, and the faith of
America," he said. "We do not re
treat. We are not content to stand
still. As Americans, we go for
ward, in the service of our country,
by the will of God."

His face grim, his thinning grey
hair rumpled by a stiff, wintry wind
which chilled his listeners, he drew
cheers and applause when he said
slowly and with emphasis:
"Democracy is not dying."
The oath of office was adminis
tered to the President at 12:11 p.m.
by Chief Justice Charles Evans
Hughes. His left hand resting on
his family's two-century-old Dutch
bible and his right hand raised, Mr.
Roosevelt pledged to "preserve, pro
tect, and defend the Constitution of
the United States, so help me God."
FAITH IS KEYNOTE
Henry Agard Wallace, former Sec
retary of Agriculture, had been
sworn in as Vice-President a mo
ment earlier by his immediate prede
cessor, John Nance Garner.
Keynote of the President's ad
dress was this nation's unswerving
faith in democratic principles and
its determination they shall not be
overcome by enemies without the
United States or apathy of those
within.
He did not, in so many words, re
affirm this country's plan to supply
all-out aid to democracies resisting
aggression. But, this promise ran
through the message in his defense
of democracy.
HEMISPHERE A UNIT
The President mentioned no other
country by name. But his frequent
mention of the "Americas" indicated
he continued to think of the entire
western hemisphere as one unit in
the struggle against the spread of
totalitarianism.
Mr. Roosevelt compared the tasks
before the people today to those of
the day of George Washington and
Abraham Lincoln. In Washington's
day, he said, the need was to create
and weld together a nation; in Lin
coln's day to preserve that nation
from disruption from within.
He concluded with this admoni
tion:
"In the face of great perils never
before encountered, our strong pur
pose is to protect and to perpetuate
the integrity of democracy. For this
we muster the spirit of America, the
faith of America."
