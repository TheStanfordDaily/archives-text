# Men's Council Probes Honor Code Violation
## Postpones Decision; Dockets Flooded By Parking Tickets 
### 
Men's Council, discussing the first
Honor Code violation on its docket
this quarter and the second of this
year, yesterday postponed a deci
sion in the case until further inves
tigation of circumstances surround
ing the violation could be made.
Decision was postponed for a
week. Council members made no
further comment on the Code in
fraction.
A "certain student" was required
to complete 12 hours at the Conval
escent Home before Reg day, spring
quarter, for holding a reserve book
out the night and morning before a
last-quarter final.
The book, needed for study by all
members in the course, was the only
one on reserve.
PARKING VIOLATIONS
Pelted from all sides with parking
violations growing from the increas
ing muddy weather parking problem
on campus, Council continued its
policy of holding pedestrian rights
more important than parking privi
lege's m pedestrian walk-ways.
Greatest contention was the zone
behind the education libe parking
lot. During the dry season, cars
could park anywhere in that area.
Now, with the area a morass, driv
eis cutting to 8 o'clocks left their
rear wheels on the sidewalk, forc
ing pedestrians into the street.
SIGNS SHOW
To clarify the zone, "no parking"
signs were augmented along the road
by B.A.C. parking blocks.
Speeders again were warned that
Galvez, the highway past Encina and
the 8.A.C., had become the main
artery of down-town traffic with the
101 underpass still in stages of com
pletion, and that due caution should
be observed in that area.
With several parking and speed
ing offenders not appearing at either
of the first two meetings of the
quarter, Council reaffirmed its pol
icy of increasing fines for late-com
ers who do not contact some mem
ber of Council before a non-ap
pearance.

the 8.A.C., had become the main
artery of down-town traffic with the
101 underpass still in stages of com
pletion, and that due caution should
be observed in that area.
With several parking and speed
ing offenders not appearing at either
of the first two meetings of the
quarter, Council reaffirmed its pol
icy of increasing fines for late-com
ers who do not contact some mem
ber of Council before a non-ap
pearance.
Men's Council, discussing the first
Honor Code violation on its docket
this quarter and the second of this
year, yesterday postponed a deci
sion in the case until further inves
tigation of circumstances surround
ing the violation could be made.
Decision was postponed for a
week. Council members made no
further comment on the Code in
fraction.
A "certain student" was required
to complete 12 hours at the Conval
escent Home before Reg day, spring
quarter, for holding a reserve book
out the night and morning before a
last-quarter final.
The book, needed for study by all
members in the course, was the only
one on reserve.
PARKING VIOLATIONS
Pelted from all sides with parking
violations growing from the increas
ing muddy weather parking problem
on campus, Council continued its
policy of holding pedestrian rights
more important than parking privi
lege's m pedestrian walk-ways.
Greatest contention was the zone
behind the education libe parking
lot. During the dry season, cars
could park anywhere in that area.
Now, with the area a morass, driv
eis cutting to 8 o'clocks left their
rear wheels on the sidewalk, forc
ing pedestrians into the street.
SIGNS SHOW
To clarify the zone, "no parking"
signs were augmented along the road
by B.A.C. parking blocks.
Speeders again were warned that
Galvez, the highway past Encina and
the 8.A.C., had become the main
artery of down-town traffic with the
101 underpass still in stages of com
pletion, and that due caution should
be observed in that area.
With several parking and speed
ing offenders not appearing at either
of the first two meetings of the
quarter, Council reaffirmed its pol
icy of increasing fines for late-com
ers who do not contact some mem
ber of Council before a non-ap
pearance.
