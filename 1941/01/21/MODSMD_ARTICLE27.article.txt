# Law Association Plans Fund Dance
## 
### 
Precedent will be broken on Sat
urday when the Law Association will
give its first dance. The dance, al
though sponsored by the Law Asso
ciation, is for the benefit of a schol
ar.ship fund sponsored by this year's
Law School graduating class.
The dance is to be held at the
Millbrae Country Club. Ernie Heck
scher, who is currently at the Mark,
will play. The admission fee is $2
per couple.
All money made on the dance will
be given to this year's graduating
class to begin their scholarship fund.
The money will either be put in the
bank or into annuities. After gradu
ation, the class will continue to pay
dues which wiil also be placed in
the fund. In about 20 years, they
believe that they will have enough
for a scholarship, that is, enough to
pay for the tuition of one student for
one year.
