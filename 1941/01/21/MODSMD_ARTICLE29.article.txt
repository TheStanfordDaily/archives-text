# Vichy Refuses Fleet to Nazis
## Petain Returns Laval To Place in Regime 
### 
VICHY, Jan. 20 (UP). â€” France
refuses to turn over her immobilized
fleet to Germany for use against
Britain and insists upon full observ
ance of the French-German armis
tice despite the reconciliation of
Marshal Henri Philippe Petain and
Pierre Laval, an official spokesman
said Monday.
The "dissipation of all misunder
standings" between Petain and the
man he ousted as vice-premier on
Dec. 13 was undertaken by the 84-
year-old marshal in a move to curb
a violent campaign in the Paris press
against the Vichy government, it
was stated.
FORESEE SHAKE-UP
There was strong speculation the
ardently pro-German Laval might
be restored to a place in the Vichy
regime, perhaps as a special inter
mediary between Vichy and the
German authorities in Paris.
Petain's special emissary to Paris
at present is Count Fernand de Bri
non, who worked closely with Laval
during the latter's striving for closer
collaboration between France and
Germany.
A revision of Petain's cabinet and
a reaffirmation of collaboration with
Adolf Hitler was anticipated.
NO POLICY CHANGE
A government spokesman asserted
today that as a result of the Petain-
Laval meeting, aboard a railroad
coach at LaFerte, 25 miles north of
Vichy late Saturday, French do
mestic and foreign policy "has not
undergone the slightest change" and
remains exactly as it was the day
Laval was ousted and temporarily
placed under arrest. Petain remains
the supreme chief of state with all
power in his hands and any ulti
mate cabinet shifts will not affect this
authority, the spokesman said.
EXPLAIN MOVE
The official French radio today
broadcast an explnaation of the
dramatic meeting of Marshal Pe
tain and Laval.
"It was for imperious reasons of
domestic policy that Petain decided
to deprive himself on Dec. 13 of the
aid of Laval, as Marshal Petain an
nounced over the radio the next
day," the broadcast explanation said.
