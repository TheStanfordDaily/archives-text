# Avery Describes Planned Revision of Card Files
## 
### 
Betty Avery, chairman of activity card files, announced the planned
revisions for uext year's* card files at Women's Conference yesterday. At
the same time, she stated that men's card files and the difficulty of getting
committee chairmen to use the files constituted the major problem for the
rest of the year.

Despite announcements regarding
the use of the files for all commit
tee work, chairmen have been se
lecting committees before consult
ing the files. Miss Avery asked that
conference members emphasize the
importance of using the card files in
their living groups.
Few men have signed up with the
card files, and since all committees
appointed in the future will be made
up of names from the file, it is im
perative that all men interested in
spring quarter activities sign up im
mediately. Miss Avery will be in
the card files office from 1 to 2
o'clock Monday and Tuesday to help
anyone who has not yet signed up.
PLANNED CHANGE
The planned revision of the card
files will be Incorporated into the
new A.S.S.U. Constitution. The new
plans call for a single head of card
files activities, who will be appointed
by and responsible to Ex Committee.
This head will be assisted by an
Activities Co-ordinating Board made
up of members from Conference, In
terfraternity Council, and Inter
club Council.
Newly appointed members of ac
tivity files are Ed Hutsing, repre
sentative of Interclub Council, and
Pete Whittlesey, representative from
Interfraternity Council. Phil Roen
thal has been appointed to the com
mittee as co-ordinator of the men's
files.

agenda yesterday included an an
nouncement by Nell Plopper that
