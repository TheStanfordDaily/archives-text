s Coach Everett Dean yesterday sent his casters hack to work in
tl °' l '° r a puii ' of * a,m ' s lhii > week-end against the Utmersilv
ol California and San Jose State College.
While the Indians were copping the first half of their four-game series
with U.S.C., Cal was held to a split.

with their Los Angeles brothers, ,
U.C.L.A., who were definitely fa
vored to take the eellar honors for
another year. All of which means
that either the Bruins have a bet
ter team than expected or California
is not up to snufl.
The fact that Center Fryer was the
high-point man in the Bruin vic
tory Saturday night leads to the
conclusion that the former was the
case. That is, Ucla is not as bad as I
everyone, including Cal, thought it
would be.
The thought behind this state- !
mentis this: last year Jackie Rob
inson, Ucla's one-man athletic in- '
stitution, did practically all the play- !
ing that was done by the West wood 1
quintet, so if Fryer was high scorer
on a team on which Robinson still
plays first string, it must mean that
the Bruins are playing team basket
ball instead of a one-man game.
And a team that has the-very
good Mr. Robinson is really t'ood.
