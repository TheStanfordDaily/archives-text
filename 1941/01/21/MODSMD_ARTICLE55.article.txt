# To Better Serve
## 
### 
WITH one triumph to its credit, the Stanford
Forum yesterday announced that its next
meeting will treat the subject of "The Stanford
Student Looks to National Defense."
The choice of this topic could not have been
wiser. Since that fateful October day when
Stanford men filled out those Selective Service
cards, the haze of confusion that has surrounded
national defense measures has grown thicker
and thicker. It is difficult for a potential draft
server to discover exactly what steps he may
take to prepare himself for a place that will be
of most benefit in the preparedness program.
This quandary in which most Stanford draftees
find themselves is not a localized perplexity.
The nation in general seems to lack adequate
information about means that are being em
ployed to further national defense.
Often, it seems likely, a college undergrad
uate may take university training which will
render his services much more valuable in a
specialized field than as a "squads-left-and
right" man. What these fields are, no one seems
to know.
This task of seeking to inform college men
of their place in the national picture will be
shouldered on the Farm by the Forum, acting
in conjunction with Dr. Wilbur and the Stanford
Student Defense Council. The undertaking is
an ambitious one, but its interest is so general
that it cannot fail to draw a large campus au
dience.
By way of example, Stanford's Engineering
School recently condensed its course so that
students may now fulfill their requirements in
three years. Such procedure as this deserves
the attention of undergraduates who are, per
haps, interested in employing their education in
government defense projects.
The Stanford Forum faces a task of gigantic
proportion. But any store of facts which will
help to dissipate the confusion surrounding the
place of the undergraduate in the preparedness
program will constitute a major blessing.
