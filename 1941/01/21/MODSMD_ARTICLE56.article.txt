ACTIVITIES FILE, launched in too great a
rush and branded "N.G." by many because
it failed to produce immediate results, last week
was rescued for the second time by Excom in a
streamlining move that practically assures early
success to the system.
By eliminating the co-chairman impracticality
and putting the rejuvenated File under one ex
ecutive head, Excom cut a maze of red tape that
surrounded co-ordination of the men's and wom
en's systems into one workable unit.
Rendered practically impotent during its first
quarter of existence by conflicting plans and
detail work, Activities File is now a smoothly
functioning system under a single chairman
with single responsibility.
Teeth were given the File system by an Ex
com ruling early this quarter which requires
each committee head to use the File and have
his selection stamped "okeh" before final ap
proval by Ex Committee.
Two-edged, this provision eliminates the basic
faults of the system as originally conceived.
First: Each committee chairman must of ne
cessity use the card file; for without validation
by the File chief his committee will not receive
Excom sanction. Fractious committee heads
may find their committees summarily dis
banded.
Second: Activity-conscious students must of
necessity sign up in the File system; for unless
their names are entered they will not be avail
able for selection.
With most lower - division women already
signed in the File, present likelihood is that Ex
com's axe will fall upon men selectees for com

mittee work unless Row and Hall roughs enter
the system before start of spring quarter.
Moving to bring the male element into the
system, Betty Avery, card file chief, this week
brought the head of Interfraternity Council and
an Inter-Club representative into the activities
fold. With these members to co-ordinate the
signing of men students, Activities File is as
sured a workable system by spring.
When the filing system was put into effect last
quarter, it was on a probationary basis—it had
to prove itself before Excom would cut loose
the apron strings.
Take a hot tip. The apron strings are gone.—

faults of the system as originally conceived.
First: Each committee chairman must of ne
cessity use the card file; for without validation
by the File chief his committee will not receive
Excom sanction. Fractious committee heads
may find their committees summarily dis
banded.
Second: Activity-conscious students must of
necessity sign up in the File system; for unless
their names are entered they will not be avail
able for selection.
With most lower - division women already
signed in the File, present likelihood is that Ex
com's axe will fall upon men selectees for com

mittee work unless Row and Hall roughs enter
the system before start of spring quarter.
Moving to bring the male element into the
system, Betty Avery, card file chief, this week
brought the head of Interfraternity Council and
an Inter-Club representative into the activities
fold. With these members to co-ordinate the
signing of men students, Activities File is as
sured a workable system by spring.
When the filing system was put into effect last
quarter, it was on a probationary basis—it had
to prove itself before Excom would cut loose
the apron strings.
Take a hot tip. The apron strings are gone.—

ACTIVITIES FILE, launched in too great a
rush and branded "N.G." by many because
it failed to produce immediate results, last week
was rescued for the second time by Excom in a
streamlining move that practically assures early
success to the system.
By eliminating the co-chairman impracticality
and putting the rejuvenated File under one ex
ecutive head, Excom cut a maze of red tape that
surrounded co-ordination of the men's and wom
en's systems into one workable unit.
Rendered practically impotent during its first
quarter of existence by conflicting plans and
detail work, Activities File is now a smoothly
functioning system under a single chairman
with single responsibility.
Teeth were given the File system by an Ex
com ruling early this quarter which requires
each committee head to use the File and have
his selection stamped "okeh" before final ap
proval by Ex Committee.
Two-edged, this provision eliminates the basic
faults of the system as originally conceived.
