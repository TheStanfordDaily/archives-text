# Blessed Are Those

BRAVING rumors of dirty rushing by the
Quad and Chappie, members of the Daily
edit board will slip into the edit office this after
noon at 1 o'clock to check staff preference lists.
At 1:15, members of the staff who survived
any illicit pledging practices by the rival tongs
will march into the Shack to receive editorial
congratulations. The party will break up for an
informal open house at the Union Cellar.
