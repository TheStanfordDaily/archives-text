# BULL SESSION

### BUD AMES 
you're a Stanfordite. You say you are. You've
been going around telling everybody that would
listen for quite some time now. But do you really
know what you are saying?
Do you realize what lies behind that one little word,
Stanfordite? Of course, you don't—you never stopped
to consider it. So that is what is going to happen right
now. Just consider all over the place, and the result
will be a definition of a Stanfordite.
If you are a man, you are a Stanfordite—
If you are secretly proud that somewhere on the
campus is the "Hoover Home," but for the life of you,
you don't know where it is.
If you dance at L'Omelette with three feet of good
clean salty air between you and your date, or usually,
somebody else's date.
If you've had one severe case of poison oak which
you can't explain. Hunting for a golf ball—that won't
do.
If you step into the Cellar at least twice a day for
a coke and a cigarette and several handshakes, even
though you detest cokes, are allergic to cigarette to
bacco, but just love to yell at all the gang.
If you can't remember the name of the guy who
passes you on the Quad and calls you by name. So you
yell, "Hy'ya, fellow, how's it going?" By that time he
has passed out of hearing, and really doesn't care much
because he is already yelling at somebody else.
If you wept two nights through because you forgot
to fill out an application for the Activities Card File,
and you just knew, just knew that Graham Barbey
would be awfully mad and probably wouldn't let you
paint signs for "Back to the Farm" Week.
If your house lost at least four pledges to the
Sigma Chis.

A ND if you are a woman, you are a Stanfordite—
If a sorox-ity rushed you in the rest room of a
local bar.
If the food in the hall doesn't set so well about
three times a quarter. Or if you find a little green
worm under the leaf of lettuce in your carrot and
raisin salad. Sometimes you only find half a worm—
and wiggling, too.
If you get tired of wearing clean dresses and silk
stockings around the Quad only to find that all the men
are wearing unshaven faces and a borrowed sweat
shirt.
If you think that without doubt yours is the best
house or hall on the campus.
If you are oh so tired of little men and large cokes
day after day after day.
If you would give up your best pair of nylons just
to get into a section of that cute Mr. Nicol. Isn't he
just too cuddly for words?
If you wish you could swear out loud at all the
basketball games. If you wish you could see more
swimming meets.
If you just can't understand why the fellows see so
much in that dumb girl that sits next to you in your
10 o'clock.
If you own at least six sweaters.
So now you are a Stanfordite.

SO YOU'RE A STANFORDITE?
