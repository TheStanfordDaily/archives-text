EMERY'S SISTER

r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
I have been following with interest the com
ments of my brother, Emery Bellwether, on perti
nent campus questions, and, until now have not felt
the urge to try and steal any of the glory that is right
fully his but which we consider ot belong to the family
as a whole.
However, I feel that as my esteemed fraternal rela
tive has not yet seen fit to express himself on this
question of illegal rushing, I cannot hold out any
longer.
Why must this evil exist within the ivy-clad walls
of Stanford's fraternity and sorority houses? Would it
not be much fairer to both the freshmen and the
houses if each person was allowed to make his own
choice without being taken "down the road" to one
of the "local pass-in-and-out pubs." A person cannot
make a judicious choice when he is as high as a
Georgia pine and must not be expected to do so. As
pointed out by the estimable Mr. Hutchinson in this
morning's Daily, ''high-pressure rushing methods are
. . . faults that center in undemocracy."
True, only too true, but his idea of doing away with
all sororities is entirely too strict a proposal. What
docs Emery think about it?

STANFORD'S SUPERMAN

'yHE EDITOR, SIR:
I was both surprised and amazed on reading in
The Daily that the El Campo bell was reputed to have
tipped the scales at 900 pounds. My amazement was
lessened but little when the culprits of the aflair
slashed the weight to 450 pounds. You see, I am care
taker at the Dr. Wilbur residence, and when I ar
rived at work Monday morning at five I found the
bell in the driveway in front of the porch. With a
little effort I picked up and moved the bell to a less
obstructing place upon the porch some yards away.
It pains me to think I have been underrating my
muscular power all these years. Nine hundred pounds!
I'm wasting my time as a caretaker with that much
power in my system. Confidentially, though, I did
groan under the load, and I must admit it couldn't
have weighed more than two hundred pounds.
Sincerely yours,
Muscles
