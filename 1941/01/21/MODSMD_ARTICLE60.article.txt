### ANDREY STEELE 
A master of piano technique played from the stage of the Memorial
Theater last night. He is Robert Casadesus, French virtuoso, who has
been delighting American audiences since his debut in this country in 191(5.
Unsmiling, yet with a gracious mien, the pianist gave his interested
audience a program displaying almost infallible technique, done with typ
cai French precision. Casadesus
Aras master of the instrument at all
:imes, playing with thorough and
painstaking care.

Opening the concert with Schu
bert's "Sonata in A Major, Opus
120," Casadesus successfully im
parted the warmth of the compos
er's romanticism. The Allegro
movement gave Casadesus opportu
nity to portray the lyrical swiftness
of Schubert.
TECHNICAL PROWESS
With Beethoven's Appassionata
Sonata the virtuoso continued to
display his prowess as a piano mas
ter technician. Casadesus deftly
handled the heavier and more un
wieldy parts of the Allegro Assai
and the presto with skill showing
years of background. The entire
audience seemed to feel the emotion
of the music.
Casadesus seemed more at ease as
he let the lilting sweetness of Schu
mann's "Papillons, Opus 2" carry
him away from his awareness of
technique and into a world of tone
ideas. The French pianist gave
Chopin an .excited interpretation,
forgetting himself in a torrent of
technique. He played "Scherzo,
Opus 39."
SENSITIVE, THRILLING
Sensitive to the thrilling fantasies
of Maurice Ravel's "Sonatine,"
Casadesus warmed to an exciting
climax as he played the movement
Anime. Both Modere and Mouve
ment de menuet showed the pian
ist's love of Ravel's music, and his
complete knowledge of the compos
ers' musical mind.
Exuberant as he finished the last
number of the printed program,
Casadesus rollicked through "Bour
ree fantasque" by Chabrier. The
French modernist gave the virtuoso
a vehicle which offered the possi
bility of combining his technique
with a subtle spark of tantalizing
spontaneity.
All in all the solemn yet not un
appreciative artist received the tu
mult of applause accorded him with
a courtly composure. And indeed the
applause was due him. For the con
cert was one for serious music lov
ers and made no concessions to a
musically untrained audience. It
was a musician's program played to
a receptive and intelligent audience.

Theater last night. He is Robert Casadesus, French virtuoso, who has
been delighting American audiences since his debut in this country in 191(5.
Unsmiling, yet with a gracious mien, the pianist gave his interested
audience a program displaying almost infallible technique, done with typ
cai French precision. Casadesus
Aras master of the instrument at all
:imes, playing with thorough and
painstaking care.

Opening the concert with Schu
bert's "Sonata in A Major, Opus
120," Casadesus successfully im
parted the warmth of the compos
er's romanticism. The Allegro
movement gave Casadesus opportu
nity to portray the lyrical swiftness
of Schubert.
TECHNICAL PROWESS
With Beethoven's Appassionata
Sonata the virtuoso continued to
display his prowess as a piano mas
ter technician. Casadesus deftly
handled the heavier and more un
wieldy parts of the Allegro Assai
and the presto with skill showing
years of background. The entire
audience seemed to feel the emotion
of the music.
Casadesus seemed more at ease as
he let the lilting sweetness of Schu
mann's "Papillons, Opus 2" carry
him away from his awareness of
technique and into a world of tone
ideas. The French pianist gave
Chopin an .excited interpretation,
forgetting himself in a torrent of
technique. He played "Scherzo,
Opus 39."
SENSITIVE, THRILLING
Sensitive to the thrilling fantasies
of Maurice Ravel's "Sonatine,"
Casadesus warmed to an exciting
climax as he played the movement
Anime. Both Modere and Mouve
ment de menuet showed the pian
ist's love of Ravel's music, and his
complete knowledge of the compos
ers' musical mind.
Exuberant as he finished the last
number of the printed program,
Casadesus rollicked through "Bour
ree fantasque" by Chabrier. The
French modernist gave the virtuoso
a vehicle which offered the possi
bility of combining his technique
with a subtle spark of tantalizing
spontaneity.
All in all the solemn yet not un
appreciative artist received the tu
mult of applause accorded him with
a courtly composure. And indeed the
applause was due him. For the con
cert was one for serious music lov
ers and made no concessions to a
musically untrained audience. It
was a musician's program played to
a receptive and intelligent audience.
