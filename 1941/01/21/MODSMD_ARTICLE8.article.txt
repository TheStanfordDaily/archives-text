# 'I Am' Followers Acquitted by Jury

LOS ANGELES, Jan. 20 (UP).â€”
White-garbed followers of the "I
Am" movement today shrieked their
blessings upon judge and jury in a
federal courtroom where three lead
ers of the nation-wide religious order
were acquitted on mail fraud
charges and the jury failed to reach
a verdict in the cases of six other
defendants.
Since Thursday, when Judge Leon
R. Yankwich turned the case over to
the jury of 12 men, the "I Am" fol
lowers have sat patiently awaiting
the outcome of the seven-week trial
while the jurors tried to come to
some agreement on the guilt or in
nocence of the nine persons charged
with defrauding these and other be
lievers in the Ascended Masters of
the "I Am" movement of $15,000,000.
