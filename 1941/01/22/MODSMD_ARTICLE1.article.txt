### BOB LOW 
REVOLUTION in Rumania."
That's the headline carried by
newspapers in neighboring Bul
garia yesterday.
According to reports coming direct
from Bucharest, something less
than a revolution is taking place
there, but widespread disorders are
admitted.
The whole thing started when a
Nazi Iron Guardist official was
murdered. Just who did the jol>
has not been ascertained. In fact,
different versions of the crime were
heard in accounts in Berlin, Bel
grade, Sofia, and Budapest.
Four capitals have four different
accounts of the murder, and each
version reflects the influence of a
strong propaganda machine.
In Berlin, the official German
news agency said that the assassina
tion was carried out by a "radical
Greek" and that ten prominent
Greeks were ordered arrested in the
Rumanian capital.
In Budapest, it was reported that
the assassin was identified as one
Axiatis, a Greek boxing champion,
and that he had been executed for
the crime.
In Belgrade, it was intimated that
the assassination had been planned
and carried out by extremist Iron
Guardists within the police ranks.
This was backed up by the claim
that all members of the Rumanian
police holding Iron Guard member
ships had been discharged.
In Sofia, the cries were revolution,
and officials there and in Ankora,
Turkey, indicated that Communists
were involved in the assassination.
* * Sj!
three of these four
reports and perhaps all four of
them are erroneous. Each of the
governments that published sup
posedly accurate accounts of the
disturbances in Rumania had a par
ticular object in slanting the story.
Each tried to make it fit in with an
already outlined policy.
Both Berlin and Budapest, capital
of Hungary, which is under Nazi
domination, hope that they can
frame a Greek, perhaps in the same
manner that a Communist was
framed as perpetrator of the Reich
stag fire crime.
Belgrade, capital of a country all
but surrounded by Axis armed
might, still hopes to resist conquest
by Italy and Germany. To claim
that an Iron Guardist was killed by
another Iron Guardist is to try to
take a neutral position on the mat
ter.
In Sofia, and in Ankara, it is hoped
that Russia will stand up against fur
ther Nazi aggression in the Balkans.
If it is proved that a Communist
murdered a Nazi in Rumania, it
could be implied that all was not
well between Germany and the So
viet. Bulgaria and Turkey hope
that this is true .because she feels
that only a Russian stand against
Germany will bolster the other
neutral countries of the Balkan
region.

interesting rumors have cir
culated in Zurich, Switzerland,
for the past few days.
Germany, according to one dis
patch, was forced to abandon plans
to send troops through Bulgaria
to invade Greece from the north
hccausc Russia demanded that the
Nazis leave Bulgaria alone as the
price of Moscow's acceptance of
the new Russian-German trade
treaty.
The second holds that a Greek
commercial delegation passing
through Istanbul en route from Mos
cow was quoted as saying that the
Soviet has 1,800,000 troops on the
German border and "expects to go
to war with Germany eventually."
Both of Ihese reports lacked con
firmation.
These rumors, like the ones com
ing from the capitals which com
mented on the Rumanian assassina
tion, sound like wish-thinking on
the part of their authors.
But the next few weeks, following
the latest Hitler-Mussolini meeting,
will tell which, if any, of these re
ports has any foundation.

These rumors, like the ones com
ing from the capitals which com
mented on the Rumanian assassina
tion, sound like wish-thinking on
the part of their authors.
But the next few weeks, following
the latest Hitler-Mussolini meeting,
will tell which, if any, of these re
ports has any foundation.
REVOLUTION in Rumania."
That's the headline carried by
newspapers in neighboring Bul
garia yesterday.
According to reports coming direct
from Bucharest, something less
than a revolution is taking place
there, but widespread disorders are
admitted.
The whole thing started when a
Nazi Iron Guardist official was
murdered. Just who did the jol>
has not been ascertained. In fact,
different versions of the crime were
heard in accounts in Berlin, Bel
grade, Sofia, and Budapest.
Four capitals have four different
accounts of the murder, and each
version reflects the influence of a
strong propaganda machine.
In Berlin, the official German
news agency said that the assassina
tion was carried out by a "radical
Greek" and that ten prominent
Greeks were ordered arrested in the
Rumanian capital.
In Budapest, it was reported that
the assassin was identified as one
Axiatis, a Greek boxing champion,
and that he had been executed for
the crime.
In Belgrade, it was intimated that
the assassination had been planned
and carried out by extremist Iron
Guardists within the police ranks.
This was backed up by the claim
that all members of the Rumanian
police holding Iron Guard member
ships had been discharged.
In Sofia, the cries were revolution,
and officials there and in Ankora,
Turkey, indicated that Communists
were involved in the assassination.

three of these four
reports and perhaps all four of
them are erroneous. Each of the
governments that published sup
posedly accurate accounts of the
disturbances in Rumania had a par
ticular object in slanting the story.
Each tried to make it fit in with an
already outlined policy.
Both Berlin and Budapest, capital
of Hungary, which is under Nazi
domination, hope that they can
frame a Greek, perhaps in the same
manner that a Communist was
framed as perpetrator of the Reich
stag fire crime.
Belgrade, capital of a country all
but surrounded by Axis armed
might, still hopes to resist conquest
by Italy and Germany. To claim
that an Iron Guardist was killed by
another Iron Guardist is to try to
take a neutral position on the mat
ter.
In Sofia, and in Ankara, it is hoped
that Russia will stand up against fur
ther Nazi aggression in the Balkans.
If it is proved that a Communist
murdered a Nazi in Rumania, it
could be implied that all was not
well between Germany and the So
viet. Bulgaria and Turkey hope
that this is true .because she feels
that only a Russian stand against
Germany will bolster the other
neutral countries of the Balkan
region.
