,the students of Stanford University,"
after Dramatic Council had con
cluded arrangements for the release
of the money.
As head of the committee on se
lection, Dr. Heffner said, "It is only
right that the student members of
the committee should be consulted
by the faculty members, and that
their wishes should be given the
deepest consideration. They ought
to take a deep interest in the work
done."
FIELD NOT DECIDED
At present, according to Dr. Heff
ner, it has not been decided what
field the library will specialize in—if
it does specialize at all.
"We might specialize in American
drama," he declared, "or the com
mittee might decidc to concentrate
on Elizabethan drama, using the
University's already excellent col
lection as a nucleus, or perhaps we
may start a collection of theatrical
history."
He pointed out that the historical
collection might be better than the
atrical literature because "we're
more apt to buy the theater litera
ture out of the regular funds."
"At any rate," he added, "the
committee will make no move toward
the disposition of the money until
we know exactly what we want."
A survey of the material already
in the library is being made at pres
ent, and the $2,000 will, of course,
only supply the beginning of the
collection. Ram's Head and Dramatic
Council will make additional grants
each year, the amount to be deter
mined by the annual profits of the
organization.
PLAN ADDITIONS
The library, however, will not
have to rely ofi Council gifts
alone, Dr. HefTner said. It is plan
ned that the Stanford Players will
give "drama library" performances
each year, the profits 'from which
will also go towards the purchase
of additional books.
Expressing himself as "enthusias
tic" about the future of the project,
Dr. HefTner cited as an example the
■Elizabethan library at Yale, started
from student funds, and now consid
ered one of the finest collections in
the country; the same is true of the
Johns Hopkins "Tudor and Stuart"
club founded by the famous physi
cian, Sir William Osier.
"The grant is an honor to Ram's
i Head and a gift worthy of the
University," he concluded.

their wishes should be given the
deepest consideration. They ought
to take a deep interest in the work
done."
FIELD NOT DECIDED
At present, according to Dr. Heff
ner, it has not been decided what
field the library will specialize in—if
it does specialize at all.
"We might specialize in American
drama," he declared, "or the com
mittee might decidc to concentrate
on Elizabethan drama, using the
University's already excellent col
lection as a nucleus, or perhaps we
may start a collection of theatrical
history."
He pointed out that the historical
collection might be better than the
atrical literature because "we're
more apt to buy the theater litera
ture out of the regular funds."
"At any rate," he added, "the
committee will make no move toward
the disposition of the money until
we know exactly what we want."
A survey of the material already
in the library is being made at pres
ent, and the $2,000 will, of course,
only supply the beginning of the
collection. Ram's Head and Dramatic
Council will make additional grants
each year, the amount to be deter
mined by the annual profits of the
organization.
PLAN ADDITIONS
The library, however, will not
have to rely ofi Council gifts
alone, Dr. HefTner said. It is plan
ned that the Stanford Players will
give "drama library" performances
each year, the profits 'from which
will also go towards the purchase
of additional books.
Expressing himself as "enthusias
tic" about the future of the project,
Dr. HefTner cited as an example the
■Elizabethan library at Yale, started
from student funds, and now consid
ered one of the finest collections in
the country; the same is true of the
Johns Hopkins "Tudor and Stuart"
club founded by the famous physi
cian, Sir William Osier.
"The grant is an honor to Ram's
i Head and a gift worthy of the
University," he concluded.

Terming Dramatic Council's $2,0(10 library gift "intelligent and fore
sighted," Dr. Hubert HefTner, head of the Division of Speech and Drama,
yesterday outlined the plans of the committee on selection.
The unprecedented grant, announced yesterday, was presented to
tllu division for the purpose of "founding a dramatic library for all
,the students of Stanford University,"
after Dramatic Council had con
cluded arrangements for the release
of the money.
As head of the committee on se
lection, Dr. Heffner said, "It is only
right that the student members of
the committee should be consulted
by the faculty members, and that
