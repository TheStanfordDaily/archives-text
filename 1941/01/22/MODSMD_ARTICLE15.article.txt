Facing his audience. Bishop Parsons then defined the purpose of the

Conference as one of trying "to
the ways in which the quality of
leadership which God gives may be
made more effective in doing the
work of leadership."
The Conference will last two more

commemorative of the 50th anni

Second speaker yesterday was D.
Elton Trueblood, University chap
lain, who maintained that the pro
motion of religious experience will
be made easier when it is realized
that the validity of religious experi
ence is really stronger than that of
sensory experience.
In explaining some of the hin
drances to widespread religious be
lief, Dr. Trueblood drew from his
contacts here with students.
"They think they don't believe
and they think that they are not
concerned with the church, but they
will all agree that you can depend
on experience. That is, the tem
pered mood of our time. It has
largely come of the success of the
natural sciences."
He further defined the job of a
minister as one of spiritual mid
wifery—borrowing the figure from
Plato. "We have to help people to
give birth to their religious notions."
FATHER WALSH SPEAKS
In a forceful address given at a
luncheon session of the Conference,
Father Charles Walsh, president of
Santa Clara, called for organization
of leadership "by mapping out ways
in which the young can lead for God
and godliness, as other forces have
planned ways for them to lead for
atheism and other perverse isms."
At the afternoon session, the
group, vastly enlarged since morn
ing, heard Dr. Lynn T. White, Sr.,
who dealt concretely and spiritedly
with the problem of "Training for
the Pastoral Office."
He stressed the thorough ground
ing in "good" theology and the sound
knowledge of Christian ethics with
which the young minister should bo
equipped.
He dwelt even more feelingly on
the minister's position in the com
munity as the "expert comforter." In
this context, he said, "The pastoral
preacher will know on what fronts
his people will be fighting their
battles." To aid in these battles, Dr.
Vv hite held that the minister must
1)'. building the morale of his people
constantly. He must know the
language of religion and use it
a: ;iinst the despair, physical sick
i!' s, of anguish of his parishioners.
Quoting, Dr. White cautioned. "Re
: ruber, most people are fighting a
hard battle."
Last speaker of the day was Ar
r Cushman McGifTert, president
of the Pacific School of Religion.
C'iiing the need for a synthesis be
tween Christianity and securalism,
P isident McGifTert stressed, how
< \ r, the critical benefits which are
to be derived from secularism.

Second speaker yesterday was D.
Elton Trueblood, University chap
lain, who maintained that the pro
motion of religious experience will
be made easier when it is realized
that the validity of religious experi
ence is really stronger than that of
sensory experience.
In explaining some of the hin
drances to widespread religious be
lief, Dr. Trueblood drew from his
contacts here with students.
"They think they don't believe
and they think that they are not
concerned with the church, but they
will all agree that you can depend
on experience. That is, the tem
pered mood of our time. It has
largely come of the success of the
natural sciences."
He further defined the job of a
minister as one of spiritual mid
wifery—borrowing the figure from
Plato. "We have to help people to
give birth to their religious notions."
FATHER WALSH SPEAKS
In a forceful address given at a
luncheon session of the Conference,
Father Charles Walsh, president of
Santa Clara, called for organization
of leadership "by mapping out ways
in which the young can lead for God
and godliness, as other forces have
planned ways for them to lead for
atheism and other perverse isms."
At the afternoon session, the
group, vastly enlarged since morn
ing, heard Dr. Lynn T. White, Sr.,
who dealt concretely and spiritedly
with the problem of "Training for
the Pastoral Office."
He stressed the thorough ground
ing in "good" theology and the sound
knowledge of Christian ethics with
which the young minister should bo
equipped.
He dwelt even more feelingly on
the minister's position in the com
munity as the "expert comforter." In
this context, he said, "The pastoral
preacher will know on what fronts
his people will be fighting their
battles." To aid in these battles, Dr.
Vv hite held that the minister must
1)'. building the morale of his people
constantly. He must know the
language of religion and use it
a: ;iinst the despair, physical sick
i!' s, of anguish of his parishioners.
Quoting, Dr. White cautioned. "Re
: ruber, most people are fighting a
hard battle."
Last speaker of the day was Ar
r Cushman McGifTert, president
of the Pacific School of Religion.
C'iiing the need for a synthesis be
tween Christianity and securalism,
P isident McGifTert stressed, how

to be derived from secularism.

rial Theater.

commemorative of the 50th anni
versary of the University.
Second speaker yesterday was D.
Elton Trueblood, University chap
lain, who maintained that the pro
motion of religious experience will
be made easier when it is realized
that the validity of religious experi
ence is really stronger than that of
sensory experience.
In explaining some of the hin
drances to widespread religious be
lief, Dr. Trueblood drew from his
contacts here with students.
"They think they don't believe
and they think that they are not
concerned with the church, but they
will all agree that you can depend
on experience. That is, the tem
pered mood of our time. It has
largely come of the success of the
natural sciences."
He further defined the job of a
minister as one of spiritual mid
wifery—borrowing the figure from
Plato. "We have to help people to
give birth to their religious notions."
FATHER WALSH SPEAKS
In a forceful address given at a
luncheon session of the Conference,
Father Charles Walsh, president of
Santa Clara, called for organization
of leadership "by mapping out ways
in which the young can lead for God
and godliness, as other forces have
planned ways for them to lead for
atheism and other perverse isms."
At the afternoon session, the
group, vastly enlarged since morn
ing, heard Dr. Lynn T. White, Sr.,
who dealt concretely and spiritedly
with the problem of "Training for
the Pastoral Office."
He stressed the thorough ground
ing in "good" theology and the sound
knowledge of Christian ethics with
which the young minister should bo
equipped.
He dwelt even more feelingly on
the minister's position in the com
munity as the "expert comforter." In
this context, he said, "The pastoral
preacher will know on what fronts
his people will be fighting their
battles." To aid in these battles, Dr.
Vv hite held that the minister must
1)'. building the morale of his people
constantly. He must know the
language of religion and use it
a: ;iinst the despair, physical sick
i!' s, of anguish of his parishioners.
Quoting, Dr. White cautioned. "Re
: ruber, most people are fighting a
hard battle."
Last speaker of the day was Ar
r Cushman McGifTert, president
of the Pacific School of Religion.
C'iiing the need for a synthesis be
tween Christianity and securalism,
P isident McGifTert stressed, how
< \ r, the critical benefits which are
to be derived from secularism.
