# Dr. Rufus Jones Tells Meaning of Immortality In Man's Worldly Life
## West Lecturer Delivers First Talk of Series 
### JOHN HORRALL 
Immortality must lit in with the
rest of man's life, not being some
thing apart from life itself. Dr. Ru
fus Jones explained last night in the
first of the series of James West
Memorial Lectures on "Implications
of Man's Mind." He believes that we
must look for a connection between
the mortal and the immortal in
spirit.
"By spirit I mean a conscious self,
an experiencing subject, with or
ganizing dominion over its objects of
experience, together with a persist
ent self-identity and a purpose of
its own," Dr. Jones pointed out.
With the thought that every ex
perience is an experience of time,
the lecturer remarked that there
can be no experienced time in be
ings without spirit. All .of this in
volves looking back on experiences
and forward to the future. In this
felt duration-time, which is con
trasted with geological or clock
time, we blend the past, present, and
future into a momentous duration
with inward significance.
MIND IS A WHOLE'
"Significance is what counts,
rather than length." Dr. Jones be
lieves. "The mind in great moments
of decision seems to be operating as
a whole rather than as a thing of
parts. The conclusion, the decision
often seems to roll out ready made,
as though in this vilal duration-time
our accumulated wisdom suddenly
functioned as a unit, without inter
mediate steps."
Dr. Jones emphasized that this
unique time-experience is the char
acteristic form of all moral endeavor.
As well as being the basis of our
capacity to look before and after, it
is the foundation of our apprecia
tion of music, prose, and poetry.
"The mind that knows cannot be
utterly sundered from the external
world of nature. It is no longer ten
able to suppose that our minds cre
ate their objects out of mental stuff.
The world outside has a stubborn
reality of its own," he declared
WORLD LIKE CIRCLE
He compared this world outside
with the convex and concave sides
of a circle, in that they are different
but cannot be pried apart and made
independent entities. We do, how
ever, possess, in our sanity, an in
tegral, self-idcntical self, which
knows what it knows and does what
it does, he added.
"We are in large measure the
makers of ourselves," he concluded,
"but fortunately we start with a
precious impartation, or birth-gift,
which is big with the potentiality of
spirit; otherwise we might have
ended as a hop-toad, 'A creature
predestined to move in a well-de
fined groove,' with no power to build
a self from within."
Dr. Jones was introduced to the
capacity audience by Dr. Ray Ly
man Wilbur. Tonight at 7:30 Dr.
Jones will discuss "Goods That Are
Good Without Qualification," and
tomorrow he talks on the "Intima
tions of an Over-World." Last
night's lecture was the first of these
lectures for the Stanford Conference
on Spiritual Leadership.
