.51. and Feb. 1.
In the early 15th century the Eng- j
! lish overran France, leaving the
French only one stronghold â€” Or-
I leans. The Dauphin had to be J
| crowned at Rheims to become king j
of France. But since his mother j
I favored the English, she claimed he j
j was illegitimate, and did all in her J
power to prevent him from being j
crowned.
Joan was a simple peasant maid
of Domremy who, while she was |
! watching her flocks, heard the voices !
of Saint Catherine and Saint Michael
telling her that hers was the destiny j
to save France.
VICTIM OF TRICK
She persuaded Baudricourt, a i
i military squire, to lend her soldiers !
to go to Orleans to see the Dauphin.
When Joan arrived in court she |
j found a trick had been played upon j
her and that they had put Giles de
| Rais upon the throne to fool her.
But Joan selected the Dauphin from
among the courtiers.
Belief in Joan's mission took the
people by storm and under her
leadership and Dunois' military
strategy, the French relieved be
seiged Orleans. Backed by the
people, Joan undertook to have the j
i Dauphin crowned at Rheims to the i
confusion of Ihe English.
CHURCH OPPOSES
The Earl of Warwick, and Cau- !
| chon, the religious power behind !
j the throne of England were opposed [
j to Joan from the first because they '
i felt that she would aid the down- |
, fall of ihe nobility and the church. !
| They bent every effort to capture i
j her, and when she was taken at !
' 1 Compeigne by treachery even her
| j friends deserted her.
Joan was tried as a sorceress and |
, after months of imprisonment con- j
demned to be burned.
Immediately after her death, faith I
in her saintliness spread and in a j
I : later century she was canonized.
