# Bloody Street Fighting In Bucharest; Antonescu, Iron Guard Make Peace
## Sweeping Decrees Place Industry Under Military Control; Army Men Put in High Positions of Authority 
### 
BUCHAREST, Wed., Jan. 22 (UP). —Premier Gen. lon Antonescu last
night fixed a 24-hour deadline for the complete crushing of "anarchy"
which spread across Rumania after the assassination of a German general
staff officer in Bucharest.
At the same time Antonescu, fiery "red dog" of the Army before he

became dictator four months ago,<
militarized the nation's key indus
tries v including arms plants, and
placed army leaders in posts of
high authority, including the Min
istry of Interior and Police.
An agreement between the pro-
Nazi Iron Guard and the Antonescu
regime restored calm in Bucharest
after daylong widespread disorders
described in a joint Iron Guard-Gov
ernment statement as amounting to
"the first lap of a national revolu
tion."
By Antonescu's decree, 87 vital in
dustries were placed under military
control, including all state and pri
vate arms plants, the Rumanian
Ford plant, the Standard and Inter
national Oil companies, cement, shoe,
cigarette, aviation, telephone fix
tures, oil well supplies, match and
textile plants.
UNIFYING DECREE
The sweeping decree, it was said,
is designed to "unify and guaran
tee Rumanian vital production."
The crisis precipitated by the as
sassination of Major Doering, of the
German general staff, was understood
to have led directly to Antonescu's
dismissal of Minister of Interior lon
Petrovitschescu, and the naming of
General Dimitriu Popescu to the
post.
The chief of the Rumanian secret
service also was ousted and the
crisis spread when high officials of
Bucharest and px*ovincial centers,
who were Petrovitschescu's ap
pointees, refused to give up their
posts.
SOLDIERS MARCH
Since Monday night, police head
quarters of Bucharest has been
guarded by soldiers, who paraded
late Tuesday behind a military band
and were cheei'ed by crowds.
A spokesman of the Antonescu
government and Commander Med
rea of the Iron Guard last night is
sued a joint statement to the foreign
press branding as an "odious crime"
the assassination of Major Doering.
