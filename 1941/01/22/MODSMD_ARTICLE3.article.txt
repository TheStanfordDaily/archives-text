BUCHAREST, Wed., Jan. 22 (UP). —Premier Gen. lon Antonescu last
night fixed a 24-hour deadline for the complete crushing of "anarchy"
which spread across Rumania after the assassination of a German general
staff officer in Bucharest.
At the same time Antonescu, fiery "red dog" of the Army before he

became dictator four months ago,<
militarized the nation's key indus
tries v including arms plants, and
placed army leaders in posts of
high authority, including the Min
istry of Interior and Police.
An agreement between the pro-
Nazi Iron Guard and the Antonescu
regime restored calm in Bucharest
after daylong widespread disorders
described in a joint Iron Guard-Gov
ernment statement as amounting to
"the first lap of a national revolu
tion."
By Antonescu's decree, 87 vital in
dustries were placed under military
control, including all state and pri
vate arms plants, the Rumanian
Ford plant, the Standard and Inter
national Oil companies, cement, shoe,
cigarette, aviation, telephone fix
tures, oil well supplies, match and
textile plants.
UNIFYING DECREE
The sweeping decree, it was said,
is designed to "unify and guaran
tee Rumanian vital production."

sassination of Major Doering, of the
German general staff, was understood
to have led directly to Antonescu's
dismissal of Minister of Interior lon
Petrovitschescu, and the naming of
General Dimitriu Popescu to the
post.
The chief of the Rumanian secret
service also was ousted and the
crisis spread when high officials of
Bucharest and px*ovincial centers,
who were Petrovitschescu's ap
pointees, refused to give up their
posts.

sued a joint statement to the foreign
press branding as an "odious crime"
the assassination of Major Doering.
"After the first kip of rational I
revolution the country will resume
a normal, quiet and peaceful life," it
was stated.
This agreement between the Iron
Guard and the government to end
the critical situation brought sighs
of relief through the country.
Antonescu, in his demand for or
der, said:
"Peace and order must be re
established within 24 hours."
The official gazette said of the as
sassination of Doering, without
