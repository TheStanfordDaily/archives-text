A SWASTIKA FLEW over San Francisco Saturdayâ€”for a
while. At right, crowds gather in protest below the official
German emblem flown legally from the offices of the Ger
man consulate ten stories above the street. Harold Sturte
vant, sailor aboard the U.S. Destroyer Craven, may be seen
in the right picture as he prepared to climb out on the flag
pole from a fire escape. Above, he straddles the pole pre
cariously and rips at the flag with a knife. Sturtevant and his
confederate, shown together on the fire escape (right) were
convicted of "malicious mischief" by a San Francisco court,
then turned over to the Navy.
