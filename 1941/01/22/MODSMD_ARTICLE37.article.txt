'T'HAT was quite a rough little
soiree the Indian and Trojan j
hoop teams put on for the benefit i
of some 2,600 customers in the Pa- I
vilion Saturday night. With both
teams playing hard slashing basket
ball, the spectators saw probably the
most vicious game that's been I
played in these parts since Bob I
Herwig led a rugged Blue and Gold !
quintet.
Friday's tilt was relatively peace
ful compared to the brawl that de
veloped in the second game. At
times the Trojans seemed more in- j
tent on displaying their muscles j
than putting the ball through the 1
hoop.
'1 he whistle tooting was so per
sistent that at one time in the
second half there were seven men !
on the flour with three personal
folds against them. With that
many facing ejection it's some- j
thing of a minor miracle that only j
two men, Trojans Bob Matthews [
and Jack Bairon, were forced to
leave the game.
Referees Lloyd Leith and Ernie
Bailey did as good a job of calling j
the infractions as could be expected j
under the circumstances. On a
game like that there's not much an j
official cari do but blow his whistle j
and pray that somebody doesn't [
start swinging.
When the two teams meet again
in the Southland, before Los An- j
geles referees, Everett Dean had j
better have a hospital car reserved i
on the train for the trip home.
* * *
(> NE tiling that is becoming
more evident as the season
progresses is the defensive pro
ficiency of this Indian five. The [
only points the Trojans scored
Saturday night from within 20
feet of the hoop were free throws
and rebound shots.

The man-for-man Stanford de
fense kept the Trojans from work
ing their set plays with any degree
of success. Fordy Anderson kept
Jack Lippert, S.C. captain and scor
ing hot-shot, efficiently bottled up
throughout both games.
Sam Barry had his men using a
man-for-man also instead of the
shifting zone set-up they more often
utilize. These tactics stopped the
fast-break attack the Deanmen spe
icalize in, which may have been a
favor. The Trojarts had the edge in
man-power, and not using the fast
break might have enabled the Stan
ford players to stand the gaff bet
ter for two tough games.
* * *
the Indians will be after
their third conference win and
their ninth consecutive victory over
in Berkeley when they take on the
Bears in the first game of the series.
Which reminds us. it's about
time this school got behind what
should be a championship bas
ketball team. The rooters Friday
and Saturday, what few there
were, seemed to lie victims of the
"Oh, hell, why yell" philosophy.
Granted that the games weren't
the type to whip up a frenzied
spirit, hut there should have been
a lot more fire.
So why not make it a point to
travel over the bridge Friday night
and give the team some support? It
should be a good ball game. Don't
let that defeat Cal took at the hands
of U.C.L.A. fool you. The Bears are
always just twice as good against
favored Stanford teams.
Tickets for Friday's game are on
sale today at the B.A.C. for 40 cents
per each.

(> NE tiling that is becoming

Saturday night from within 20
feet of the hoop were free throws

The man-for-man Stanford de

of success. Fordy Anderson kept
Jack Lippert, S.C. captain and scor
ing hot-shot, efficiently bottled up
throughout both games.
Sam Barry had his men using a
man-for-man also instead of the
shifting zone set-up they more often
utilize. These tactics stopped the
fast-break attack the Deanmen spe
icalize in, which may have been a
favor. The Trojarts had the edge in
man-power, and not using the fast
break might have enabled the Stan
ford players to stand the gaff bet

the Indians will be after
their third conference win and

Bears in the first game of the series.
Which reminds us. it's about
time this school got behind what
should be a championship bas
ketball team. The rooters Friday
and Saturday, what few there
were, seemed to lie victims of the
"Oh, hell, why yell" philosophy.
Granted that the games weren't
the type to whip up a frenzied
spirit, hut there should have been
a lot more fire.
So why not make it a point to
travel over the bridge Friday night
and give the team some support? It
should be a good ball game. Don't
let that defeat Cal took at the hands
of U.C.L.A. fool you. The Bears are
always just twice as good against
favored Stanford teams.

of some 2,600 customers in the Pa- I

teams playing hard slashing basket
ball, the spectators saw probably the
most vicious game that's been I
played in these parts since Bob I
Herwig led a rugged Blue and Gold !
quintet.

ful compared to the brawl that de
veloped in the second game. At
