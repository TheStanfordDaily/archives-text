# Yearling Hoopmen Prep for Spartans
## 
### 
Facing the last and toughest half
of its 41 schedule, Stanford's year
ling hoopmen went through a rigid
floor drill yesterday in the Pavilion.
Emphasis was on a fast break of
fensive play, with lots of time de
voted to timing and speeding up long
passes.
San Jose State, slated to play the
Frosh here Saturday night, comes
up with a good team season after
season, but the Cardinal babes
haven't lost a game since the be
ginning of the quarter and shouldn't
have much trouble stopping the
Spartans.
