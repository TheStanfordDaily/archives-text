# Ruggers to Play Olympic Club In Tough Battle Saturday
## 
### 
The Stanford rugby team tackles what will probably be its toughest
opponent of the season next Saturday afternoon when the Olympic Club
visils the Farm for its annual tilt with the Indians.
Rated as one of the strongest teams in the Northern California Rugby
Union, the clubmen are greatly feared by Coaches Jim Wylie and Harry

their team are such former Stanford
greats as Bill Paulman, Pete Fay,
Gordy Malatratt, Jim Mull in. Buck
! Van Dcllen, and last year's Captain
Howard Hickingbotham. The club
bers are trying to obtain the services
j of Hugh Gallarneau for the balance
j of this season.
Association members last night de
j cided to try to do away with the
j constant bickering that arises from
throw-ins in the scrum by having
the referee perform this task in the
future. This is in the nature of an
experiment, and will be used only
if it succeeds in its purpose.
Expected to star for Stanford in
the tilt are George Jedenoff, with
three years of experience, Frankie
Albert and his educated toe, and
"Skeeter Peter" Kmetovic. Ted Cole,
ace breakaway man, will be lost to
the team for the game because of
a fall suffered in the rain Tuesday
morning.
The coaching staff is hoping that
the weather will clear off enough to
hold two hard practices this after
noon and tomorrow in preparation
j for the contest. It was stated yes-
I terday that only men showing up
for both of these practices need ex
pect to get into either of the games
Saturday afternoon.
Immediately following the varsity
tilt the jayvees will tangle with the
strong Menlo Ramblers, made up of
former players of Menlo Junior Col
lege. If the weather permits the
j games will be played in the Stadium.
