# Bears May Put Indians 'On the Spot' with Upset In Basketball Tilt at Cal
## 
### 
Although Stanford is out in front in the Southern Division standings
of the P.C.C. and js thereby rated the favorite over Cal tliis Friday night,
the Bears arc- likely to give Coach Everett Dean's Indians more than
a little worry and probably quite a bit of trouble.
This business <:f being the top choice isn't so hot. If the Indians

cop the game it will just be
everyone expects. On the other
hand, if Cal comes out on top Stan
ford's cagers will probably be called
a bunch of fakers who should never
be leading the conference.
Yet when you stop to think it over,
it is very seldom that a team, no
matter how good it is, goes through
a season in this tough conference
without a few setbacks. Even the
teams on which Hank Luisetti
starred were knocked over once in
a while.
INDIANS SHOULD WIN
So, should the Indians accidentally
drop their opener of the Cal series, j
which isn't too probable in view
of the fact that Stanford can usually
handle the Bears in the first game,
it would far from mean that the In
dians are doomed to stay out of
top spot.
Up at Berkeley Coach Nibs Price,
Bear hoop mentor, has a few cagers
who can turn on the heat when
necessary. A note of oddity is the
fact that one of these boys is Merv
Lafaille, a brother to Leon Lafaille,
who played forward for Stanford in
'38, '39, and '40.
CAL MAY IMPROVE
Price's other offensive star is Cap- '
tain Johnny McGee, lanky center. !
who tied with Lafaille for Cal scor
ing honors in the Bruin games. Each
scored 22 points.
Roy Tamm, forward, is the only
Bear starter who played first team
on last year's Cal team, which split I
their series with the Indians. As
a floor man, Tamm is only mediocre,
but he is a better than average shot.
Although he only tallied six points
per night against the Bruins, Tamm
showed in the games he played
against Stanford last season that he
can really hit the hoop when the
time comes.

ing honors in the Bruin games. Each
scored 22 points.
Roy Tamm, forward, is the only
Bear starter who played first team
on last year's Cal team, which split I
their series with the Indians. As
a floor man, Tamm is only mediocre,
but he is a better than average shot.
Although he only tallied six points
per night against the Bruins, Tamm
showed in the games he played
against Stanford last season that he
can really hit the hoop when the
time comes.
Although Stanford is out in front in the Southern Division standings
of the P.C.C. and js thereby rated the favorite over Cal tliis Friday night,
the Bears arc- likely to give Coach Everett Dean's Indians more than
a little worry and probably quite a bit of trouble.
This business <:f being the top choice isn't so hot. If the Indians

cop the game it will just be
everyone expects. On the other
hand, if Cal comes out on top Stan
ford's cagers will probably be called
a bunch of fakers who should never
be leading the conference.
Yet when you stop to think it over,
it is very seldom that a team, no
matter how good it is, goes through
a season in this tough conference
without a few setbacks. Even the
teams on which Hank Luisetti
starred were knocked over once in
a while.
INDIANS SHOULD WIN
So, should the Indians accidentally
drop their opener of the Cal series, j
which isn't too probable in view
of the fact that Stanford can usually
handle the Bears in the first game,
it would far from mean that the In
dians are doomed to stay out of
top spot.
Up at Berkeley Coach Nibs Price,
Bear hoop mentor, has a few cagers
who can turn on the heat when
necessary. A note of oddity is the
fact that one of these boys is Merv
Lafaille, a brother to Leon Lafaille,
who played forward for Stanford in
'38, '39, and '40.
CAL MAY IMPROVE
