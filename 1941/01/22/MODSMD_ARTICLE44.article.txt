# Boxers Enter Final Training
## 
### 
With elimination matches on lop
for Friday, Stanford's ring masters
are entering the final stages of train
ing for the all-University and nov
ice championships to take place a
week from today in the Pavilion.
While the publicity has been cen
tered around Vic Lindskog and
Johnny Ward in the heavyweight
All-U battle, Don Grant has estab
lished himself as a strong contender
for the watch and golden gloves to
be awarded to the champ in that
class.
Only Mel Ellett has signed up for
the light-heavy class, but others are
sure to fight. Four men, Ted Bra
vos, Ken Rosengren, John Ryan,
and Brownell Carr, will fight in the
165-pound weight class, with Ryan
and Rosengren as favorites.
Tom Mac Michael, Jim Thurmond,
and Reg Vela have signed for the
155-pound division. In the welter
weight division Frank Hewitt and
Fairfax will stage a hot battle for
the title. Dick Lyon is the only con
tender to date in the 127-pound di
vision, and Bronson Cooley and
Bruce Berg will match wits and
brawn in the flyweight class.
Twenty-four novice glovemen
have indicated their intentions to
date, but no one has signed up for
the 127 and 120 weights. Boxers
should sign up in the Encina gym
before Friday's eliminations.
