STANFORD'S student-body organization is
carrying a top - heavy financial burden.
When the A.S.S.U. borrowed over $330,000 from
the University in 1938 to construct a new thea
ter, it assumed a financial obligation which
places it, roughly, in the position of a tight-rope
walker over Niagara Falls.
As soon as Memorial Hall was completed, it
was donated to the University. But the debt con
tracted by the student-body remains, collecting
interest at 5 per cent. The principal has been
reduced to about $271,000. But this year's in
terest charges, not compounded, will total $13,-
546. And, if the income from student fees is
about the same this year as last, a deficit of
$1,300 on interest alone will exist. This amounts
to 9 per cent of interest charges. And this 9 per
cent must come from the profits of the Stanford
Union.
Under the existing agreement with the Union,
•75 per cent of its profits over the next four years
will go to the Theater Fund and 25 per cent will
be retained in the Union cash reserve fund. But
the joker exists in this clause:
The Union cash fund already totals about
$11,000. Its ceiling, under the agreement, would
be $30,000. Why it is necessary that, each year,
unused cash be dropped into a contingency
fund that is already too fat, no one can under
stand. It may be decades before the total
reaches $30,000 and all profits can be utilized
by the A.S.S.U.
Stanford students may as well face the facts.
If they ever hope to see the principal of their
1938 loan appreciably reduced and the amount
interest payments safely met, they must effect
a new contract with the Stanford Student Union
£o that its contingency fund is set at about
510,000 and its profits, above actual operating
expenses, are turned into the Theater Fund.
