# To Lead a World

IT was always one of Mrs. Stanford's fondest
hopes that the life of the University she and
her husband founded would revolve around the
Memorial Chapel.
It is perhaps fitting, therefore, that the first
function of Stanford's Fiftieth Year celebration
should itself center intimately around the cam
pus' non-sectarian place of worship.
The Stanford Conference on Spiritual Leader
ship, which commenced yesterday, and con
tinues today and tomorrow, has brought to the
Farm an imposing galaxy of theologians and
educators.
The charge has oftentimes been leveled—and
with justification—that the world in general and
Stanford in particular have swung far to the side
of materialistic considerations to the exclusion
of the ethical and moral facets of life.
The troublous world of today shows some
proof of another eclipse, which always seems
to come with warfare, of mankind's conscious
ness of the "Brotherhood of Man." In these days
when the Prince of Peace is wandering rest
lessly over the world looking for a home that
will still worship Him rather than a mortal fac
simile who masquerades in heavenly cloth, it is
refreshing to find a group gathered for the pur
pose of discussing spiritual necessities.
And that Stanford is the instrument for such
a conference must necessarily reflect credit
upon this community.
Only a handful of students were in attend
ance at the meetings yesterday, which is a per
sonal reproach to Stanford's undergraduates.
The events of the world have shown that there
is not a close enough balance between the ma
terial and the spiritual.

The dissertations are undeniably metaphysi
cal and theological, but an acquaintance with
these values is almost necessary if one is to say
he has a well-rounded outlook on life.
At yesterday's invocation, Bishop Edward L.
Parsons prayed for "courage to face, as leaders
should, the problems and the terrors of the day."
Stanford students, preparing to step into the
leadership of the next generation, might well
acquaint themselves with values that can help
make life a tolerant, adjusted affair in contrast
to today's terrorized confusion.—G. M.

to today's terrorized confusion.—G. M.
IT was always one of Mrs. Stanford's fondest
hopes that the life of the University she and
her husband founded would revolve around the
Memorial Chapel.
It is perhaps fitting, therefore, that the first
function of Stanford's Fiftieth Year celebration
should itself center intimately around the cam
pus' non-sectarian place of worship.
The Stanford Conference on Spiritual Leader
ship, which commenced yesterday, and con
tinues today and tomorrow, has brought to the
Farm an imposing galaxy of theologians and
educators.
The charge has oftentimes been leveled—and
with justification—that the world in general and
Stanford in particular have swung far to the side
of materialistic considerations to the exclusion
of the ethical and moral facets of life.
The troublous world of today shows some
proof of another eclipse, which always seems
to come with warfare, of mankind's conscious
ness of the "Brotherhood of Man." In these days
when the Prince of Peace is wandering rest
lessly over the world looking for a home that
will still worship Him rather than a mortal fac
simile who masquerades in heavenly cloth, it is
refreshing to find a group gathered for the pur
pose of discussing spiritual necessities.
And that Stanford is the instrument for such
a conference must necessarily reflect credit
upon this community.
Only a handful of students were in attend
ance at the meetings yesterday, which is a per
sonal reproach to Stanford's undergraduates.
The events of the world have shown that there
is not a close enough balance between the ma
terial and the spiritual.

The dissertations are undeniably metaphysi
cal and theological, but an acquaintance with
these values is almost necessary if one is to say
he has a well-rounded outlook on life.
At yesterday's invocation, Bishop Edward L.
Parsons prayed for "courage to face, as leaders
should, the problems and the terrors of the day."
Stanford students, preparing to step into the
leadership of the next generation, might well
acquaint themselves with values that can help
make life a tolerant, adjusted affair in contrast
to today's terrorized confusion.—G. M.
