### BUD AMES 
WHY go to college? Why throw your money away
to glean and pick out a college education from
all this hodge-podge? After all, if you are successful
in life you are successful. What more could you want
than a happy home, oodles and oodles of money to
toss around, and a happy home life to boot?
It's all yours for the asking. At least that's what
they say in the papers. You have no idea how many
really sterling propositions are waiting for you in
the Personal Want Ad columns of the paper you read
every day.
Why—why, just for example, here are a few of the
things offered in the columns of a couple of the lax-ger
San Francisco newspapers. And they're yours, yours,
all yours. So on to success and more money than
you could possibly count. It's just lying around.
* * * *
'T'HESE are quoted verbatim:
"LADY OF MEANS, 35, attractive, unencum
bered. Sunny disposition. Very large income. Univer
sity grad. Wishes to meet edu. gentleman with per
sonality, one who has at least made a success of life in
achievement, if not financially. Gentleman who can
meet the above requirements and of high character
only need apply ..."
Now there is an opportunity for some one of you
fellows. No more books, no more 8 o'clocks, nothing
but a lady of means. Morning, noon, and night.
Or how about this one for the women?
"BACHELOR, 41, desires meet young lady of good
background." How's your background?
Or how about, "YOUNG MAN, 23, wishes to meet
lady of means."
Or how about, "YOUNG MAN, 29, good income and
habits, meet girl. Obj. Matrimony."
See? See? There you are. It's just there waiting for
you. Everything you ever dreamed about. And all for
nothing. All you've got to do is write a letter, and
then supreme, refreshing happiness is yours forever
and forever.
* * * *
B U T that isn't the end of it all. There are hundreds
of other wholesome offers in the Personal Want
Ad columns. How about this one?
"ANY GIRL in trouble or distress apply to Briga
dier Lee, the Salvation Army Headquarters, San Fran
cisco."
There you are, all in a nut shell . Wasn't it foolish
to worry all this time? All you've got to do is drop in
on good old Maude, and she'll fix you up on younr
final exams, or that bank loan you want to float—and
everything.
And here's an important one: "FACE LIFTING,
noses remodeled, scars removed, ears reshaped, set
back. Wrinkled eyelids smoothed painlessly."
And finally, here is one that all of you will want to
get in on: "YOUNG LADY wants $150 loan at 4 per
cent interest." Now why don't some of you go down
and help her out? Bring some sunshine into her life.
There now . Can't you feel the good just oozing
out of you? Aren't you happy? Lots of husbands, lots
of wives, loads of money, no wrinkled eyelids, no
distress, no nothing. Happiness, supreme, complete
happiness in the Personal Want Ad column.

"LADY OF MEANS, 35, attractive, unencum
bered. Sunny disposition. Very large income. Univer
sity grad. Wishes to meet edu. gentleman with per
sonality, one who has at least made a success of life in
achievement, if not financially. Gentleman who can
meet the above requirements and of high character
only need apply ..."
Now there is an opportunity for some one of you
fellows. No more books, no more 8 o'clocks, nothing
but a lady of means. Morning, noon, and night.
Or how about this one for the women?
"BACHELOR, 41, desires meet young lady of good
background." How's your background?
Or how about, "YOUNG MAN, 23, wishes to meet
lady of means."
Or how about, "YOUNG MAN, 29, good income and
habits, meet girl. Obj. Matrimony."
See? See? There you are. It's just there waiting for
you. Everything you ever dreamed about. And all for
nothing. All you've got to do is write a letter, and
then supreme, refreshing happiness is yours forever
and forever.
* * * *
B U T that isn't the end of it all. There are hundreds
of other wholesome offers in the Personal Want
Ad columns. How about this one?
"ANY GIRL in trouble or distress apply to Briga
dier Lee, the Salvation Army Headquarters, San Fran
cisco."
There you are, all in a nut shell . Wasn't it foolish
to worry all this time? All you've got to do is drop in
on good old Maude, and she'll fix you up on younr
final exams, or that bank loan you want to float—and
everything.
And here's an important one: "FACE LIFTING,
noses remodeled, scars removed, ears reshaped, set
back. Wrinkled eyelids smoothed painlessly."
And finally, here is one that all of you will want to
get in on: "YOUNG LADY wants $150 loan at 4 per
cent interest." Now why don't some of you go down
and help her out? Bring some sunshine into her life.
There now . Can't you feel the good just oozing
out of you? Aren't you happy? Lots of husbands, lots
of wives, loads of money, no wrinkled eyelids, no
distress, no nothing. Happiness, supreme, complete
happiness in the Personal Want Ad column.

WHY go to college? Why throw your money away
to glean and pick out a college education from
all this hodge-podge? After all, if you are successful
in life you are successful. What more could you want
than a happy home, oodles and oodles of money to
toss around, and a happy home life to boot?
It's all yours for the asking. At least that's what
they say in the papers. You have no idea how many
really sterling propositions are waiting for you in
the Personal Want Ad columns of the paper you read
every day.
Why—why, just for example, here are a few of the
things offered in the columns of a couple of the lax-ger
San Francisco newspapers. And they're yours, yours,
all yours. So on to success and more money than
you could possibly count. It's just lying around.
