MOZART AND MURDER

EDITOR, SIR:
After reading in the paper of the proposal to
"Selectively" draft Yehudi Menuhin a few ideas
occurred to me:
1. It would seem that the draft board is going out
of its way to get Yehudi; after all he has a wife and
two children.
2. Must America keep justifying the charge of other
and older nations that she is uncultured? Must we
repeat the mistakes of the last war? Just to mention
two such mistakes, I recall the poets Alan Seeger
and Joyce Kilmer. They were young poets who had
time to write only enough to indicate that they had
the essential creative spark, and then it was snuffed out
"at midnight in some flaming town." Why? Because
we are a democracy and everyone is equal to his
neighbor. Granting that we are all born equal, it's
still quite obvious, isn't it, that we aren't all the same
—we have different talents and abilities. But it is use
less to labor the obvious.
3. We are a nation that worships productive effi
ciency; one feature of such a system is to put each man
to work for which he is most suited; are Yehudi's
amazing dextrous fingers primarily suited for deliv
ering the bayonet jab?

4. Apparently in this country we are, in the main,
sensible only of the gross and macroscopic in our ef
forts to be democratic. Thus we can not see beyond
and behind immediately perceptible physical goods.
Thomas Edison, indisputably a genius, produced ideas
translatable into "touchable" goods; therefore he was
not trained as a soldier. Our short-sighted view stops
here; we are incapable of putting on the same level of
value, the type of thihg which is produced by Yehudi
and which appeals to the feelings and cannot be dis
pensed with in terms of dollars and cents.
5. The conflict in Europe has driven to our shores
many artists in the class of Yehudi. The opportunity
for America to become the world's cultural center is
unparalleled. But genius in music, art, literature must
go by the board, unnoticed in consideration for se
lective service—or just unnoticed in general. On the
other hand, we cannot reasonably object (in fact, we
are boasting about it) if we become the world's
fashion center; there is culture which in terms of
money can be calculated rather lucratively.
6. It is well known that the spark of genius in
spires potential genius.
7. Even the aborigine in darkest Africa loves his
music and jealously guards it—poor barbarian.
8. If anywhere, it is in the universities that an ef
fective realization must come of this problem. And
yet I have heard college students say, "Why not? He's
no better than the rest of us." My commiseration to
these people; they have wasted four years.
9. Can it reasonably be argued that because we
choose to indulge ourselves in hearing Yehudi—or a
hundred Yehudis—play Brahms' Lullaby we shall
thereby materially weaken the forces which are pre
venting us from hearing the air-raid siren's wail?

neighbor. Granting that we are all born equal, it's
still quite obvious, isn't it, that we aren't all the same
—we have different talents and abilities. But it is use
less to labor the obvious.
3. We are a nation that worships productive effi
ciency; one feature of such a system is to put each man
to work for which he is most suited; are Yehudi's
amazing dextrous fingers primarily suited for deliv
ering the bayonet jab?

4. Apparently in this country we are, in the main,
sensible only of the gross and macroscopic in our ef
forts to be democratic. Thus we can not see beyond
and behind immediately perceptible physical goods.
Thomas Edison, indisputably a genius, produced ideas
translatable into "touchable" goods; therefore he was
not trained as a soldier. Our short-sighted view stops
here; we are incapable of putting on the same level of
value, the type of thihg which is produced by Yehudi
and which appeals to the feelings and cannot be dis
pensed with in terms of dollars and cents.
5. The conflict in Europe has driven to our shores
many artists in the class of Yehudi. The opportunity
for America to become the world's cultural center is
unparalleled. But genius in music, art, literature must
go by the board, unnoticed in consideration for se
lective service—or just unnoticed in general. On the
other hand, we cannot reasonably object (in fact, we
are boasting about it) if we become the world's
fashion center; there is culture which in terms of
money can be calculated rather lucratively.
6. It is well known that the spark of genius in
spires potential genius.
7. Even the aborigine in darkest Africa loves his
music and jealously guards it—poor barbarian.
8. If anywhere, it is in the universities that an ef
fective realization must come of this problem. And
yet I have heard college students say, "Why not? He's
no better than the rest of us." My commiseration to
these people; they have wasted four years.
9. Can it reasonably be argued that because we
choose to indulge ourselves in hearing Yehudi—or a
hundred Yehudis—play Brahms' Lullaby we shall
thereby materially weaken the forces which are pre
venting us from hearing the air-raid siren's wail?

MOZART AND MURDER

EDITOR, SIR:
After reading in the paper of the proposal to
"Selectively" draft Yehudi Menuhin a few ideas
occurred to me:
1. It would seem that the draft board is going out
of its way to get Yehudi; after all he has a wife and
two children.
2. Must America keep justifying the charge of other
and older nations that she is uncultured? Must we
repeat the mistakes of the last war? Just to mention
two such mistakes, I recall the poets Alan Seeger
and Joyce Kilmer. They were young poets who had
time to write only enough to indicate that they had
the essential creative spark, and then it was snuffed out
"at midnight in some flaming town." Why? Because
we are a democracy and everyone is equal to his
neighbor. Granting that we are all born equal, it's
