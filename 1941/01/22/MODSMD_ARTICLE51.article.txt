# 'Golden Gate' Tells Sketchy Story of Port
## 
### 
"Golden Gate," by Alfred Rosenberg.
On sale at the Stanford Bookstore.
Mr. Rosenberg has given us an
other biography of San Francisco,
but one with its attention centered
on the city as a port. The story of
the ships which have sailed through
that narrow passage between the
Marin hills and the Presidio is told
from the time of the discovery of
the Golden Gate down to the pres
ent-day Matson and President lines'
steamships.

The book, however, does not have
intrinsic value because of its new
angle on a subject too often treated
these days. Instead of writing a
really thorough and valuable work
on an intriguing port, the author
has tried to include everything from
the actions of the Vigilante Com
mittee to the building of the rail
roads in his book.

One does get, though, an interest
ing, panoramic, even if sketchy, view
of San Francisco from the water
front—a view of the city burning six
times within 18 months, while each
time the hasty, over-anxious ctiizens
rebuilt the same wooden buildings;
of nouveau riche aristocracy spend
ing money where it showed the most;
of a city held back by its own con
scious corruptness from becoming
the civilized center that it is now.

The most intensely dramatic chap
ter of the book is that on the 1934
waterfront tie-up and the resultant
general strike, which the author is
painstakingly careful to treat objec
tively. With the National Guard
troops keeping order on the Embar
cadero and all the important indus
tries idle, Mr. Rosenberg creates an
atmosphere of a great modern me
tropolis under siege.

The last chapter looks toward the
future and is a warning that if the
waterfront unions and their employ
ers don't soon settle their differences,
the port won't be worth differing
over.—Adams

intrinsic value because of its new
angle on a subject too often treated
these days. Instead of writing a
really thorough and valuable work
on an intriguing port, the author
has tried to include everything from
the actions of the Vigilante Com
mittee to the building of the rail
roads in his book.

One does get, though, an interest
ing, panoramic, even if sketchy, view
of San Francisco from the water
front—a view of the city burning six
times within 18 months, while each
time the hasty, over-anxious ctiizens
rebuilt the same wooden buildings;
of nouveau riche aristocracy spend
ing money where it showed the most;
of a city held back by its own con
scious corruptness from becoming
the civilized center that it is now.

The most intensely dramatic chap
ter of the book is that on the 1934
waterfront tie-up and the resultant
general strike, which the author is
painstakingly careful to treat objec
tively. With the National Guard
troops keeping order on the Embar
cadero and all the important indus
tries idle, Mr. Rosenberg creates an
atmosphere of a great modern me
tropolis under siege.

The last chapter looks toward the
future and is a warning that if the
waterfront unions and their employ
ers don't soon settle their differences,
the port won't be worth differing
over.—Adams
