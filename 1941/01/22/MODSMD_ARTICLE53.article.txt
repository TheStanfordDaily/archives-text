# March of Dimes Fund Receives 98% Support
## All Houses Except Zetes Give 100 Pct. To Aid $250 Total 
### 
Bob McNeil, head of the March of
Dimes campaign, reported that all
sororities gave 100 per cent and
every fraternity, except Zeta Psi,
ran up a perfect score to give the
drive a total of 5250.
The average for all living groups
was 98 per cent. The halls and eat
ing clubs that are on the honor list
are: Union Club, including its liv
ing groups, Roble, Encina, Branner,
Toyon, The Oaks, El Toro, and El
Campo. Sequoia averaged 80 per
cent and Lagunita just missed 100
per cent.
An estimated $15 to $20 was un
fortunately stolen from Sigma Chi,
Theta Xi, Delta Tau Delta, and La
gunita. These losses were reported
by Curby Lowe, who discovered the
missing money from various places
around the campus, and Dave Jack
man, who accounted for the lost
mpney boxes in the fratei*nity
houses.
Nevertheless, McNeil expects $250
as the sum total from all sources,
although the money has not been
entirely collected.
