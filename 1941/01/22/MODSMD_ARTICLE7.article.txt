# Excom Rules Four-Day Week For Con Drive
## 'Back to Farm' Day To Climax Intensive Week of Activities 
### 
Ex Committee members last night
came out in favor of a four-day
week when they recommended to
Graham Barbey, chairman of the
Convalescent Home Drive, that
"Stanford's favorite charity" be al
lotted four days of the week, in
stead of the usual five.

The recommendation was in line
with criticisms leveled at the Drive
last year on the grounds that there
were too many activities, not all of
them profitable, crammed into one
week. This year the fun-giving,
profit-showing events will be re
tained, the less purposeful events
junked.
Climax of the four-day drive, to
be held early in the spring quarter,
will be the "Back to the Farm" day
and dance on Friday night, the Con
Home week starting on Tuesday.
Profits from the dance will be split
50-50 between the Con Home Drive
and the Boathouse.
Other business of the committee
follows:
SOCIAL REGULATIONS: After
a lengthy period of consideration,
Anne Townsend presented to the
committee an outline of social func
tions designed to clarify the A.S.-
S.U.'s responsibility and authority
in such matters. Hereafter, social
functions will be categorized under
three headings: those over which Ex
Committee exercises full jurisdic
tion, requiring date clearance and
chaperone appointments; those for
which the organization need only
apply for a date; and those for which
the organization need only unoffi
cially clear the date with the vice
president.
WORLD AFFAIRS DAY: In a
communication to Bob Einstein,
chairman of the above affair, Pro
fessor E. E. Robinson listed pos
sible speakers for the occasion in
order of their preference by the
Committee on Public Exercises: Ru
dolf Holsti, Edouard Benes, Wen
dell Willkie, Harold J. Laski, Pierre
von Paasen, Royce Brier, John B.
Hughes. A quick poll of the Com
mittee resulted in preferences which
differed from those above.
MOFFETT FIELD BOYS: Anne
Townsend reported to the Commit
tee that a former Stanford man now
at Moffett Field had suggested that
Stanford extend some social cour
tesies to men stationed at Moffett
Field. It was recommended that use
of athletic equipment and perhaps
privileges of the golf course be ex
tended. Sylvia Berry's spot reac
tion to the suggestion was, "The
field has already been explored . . .
Boy!"
DEFENS E FORUM: Dwight
Hutchinson brought to the Commit
tee tentative plans made by Bill
Turner, chairman of Stanford's Na
tional Defense Committee, and Bob
Peckham, chairman of the Stan
ford Forum, for a discussion of
means by which students could aid
in national defense without neces
sarily being draftees. Committee
approved.
OLD CLOTHES DRIVE: John
Porter recommended "that the
Y.W.C.A. be allowed to have an old
clothes drive if they run it the same
way as the book driveâ€”sorta quiet."
Committee approved the recommen
dation.
