### BOB LOW 
BILL to Further Promote the
Defense of the United States,
and for Other Purposes."
That's Bill No. 1776, the lend
lease bill that has been stealing the
headlines for the past two weeks.
Hearings on the bill have been
going on before the House Commit
tee on Foreign Affairs for the past
few days, and Joseph P. Kennedy
and Charles McNary are among the
political leaders who have appeared.
The bill, in short, has been the cen
ter of the greatest controversy since
the November elections.
Most of those who oppose the bill,
as well as those who support it, fa
vor the general principle of "all
aid-short-of-war to Britain." The
conflict over the bill has been bit
ter, and the old name-calling de
vices o fevery political dispute have
been brought into play.
The provisions of the bill itself
are vague, and it is this very
vagueness that has attracted the
major portion of criticism. Op
ponents of the measure hold that
its passage will make the Presi
dent a dictator, at least in every
thing hut name.
* * *
r JPHE bill as it originally appeared
before the House Committee
gave the President wide powers over
defense materials and anything that
has any connection whatsoever with
the defense program. Included un
der the definition of defense articles
besides actual implements of war
are "any machinery for the produc
tion, processing, repair, servicing or
operation of any article (and) any
component material or part."
In another section the President is
authorized to order any government
official to manufacture or procure in
any way any defense article, and
for any country the President de
sires. And this provision has a
"notwithstanding the provisions of
any other law" clause that makes it
the more comprehensive.
The President may also lend,
transfer, exchange, or sell articles
to any country, or have such ar
ticles repaired or reconditioned
for the use of any other country.
Likewise he has wide powers over
"defense information" — a term
which includes anything that is
remotely related to national de
fense.
At the same time the bill at
tempts to prevent foreign govern
ments, who have received materials
or information from the United
States, from disposing of these ma
terials (or their patents) or this- in
formation without the consent of
the American government.
To finance the carrying out of
any of the provisions of the bill,
the President is given what amounts
to a blank-check—to spend unap
propriated moneys in the Treasury,
And finally, the President may make
any additional orders necessary tc
carry out the bill.
* # *
HTHE issues involved in the con
troversy over the bill are per
haps bigger than any of the mer
that discuss them.
In his speech at the opening of
Congress, the President asked the
American people to make the
United States an "arsenal for
Democracy." The bill that his ad
ministration proposes is aimed to
facilitate actions implied by his
words to Congress.
The President admits frankly tha
he wants to help Democracy—anj
country that resists aggression —
wherever possible. The bill, then
is more than a national issue. It i:
an issue that concerns all those wh(
are its potential benefactors. Th<
bill is of international, of universa
consequence, in the mind of th<
President and those who support it.
Throughout the 1920's and th<
1930's the United States pursued ;
course that might well be terme<
ultra-nationalistic. Tariffs weri
high; international co-operation wa
low.
What the President believes am
has in mind when he pens a bil
that will give him such unlimitei
powers is the complete abandon
ment of this policy. To him, it is
responsibility of the United States t
do its part in the ideological conflic
that envelopes the world; and thi
bill, he believes, will make his belie
possible.

and for Other Purposes."
That's Bill No. 1776, the lend
lease bill that has been stealing the
headlines for the past two weeks.
Hearings on the bill have been
going on before the House Commit
tee on Foreign Affairs for the past
few days, and Joseph P. Kennedy
and Charles McNary are among the
political leaders who have appeared.
The bill, in short, has been the cen
ter of the greatest controversy since
the November elections.
Most of those who oppose the bill,
as well as those who support it, fa
vor the general principle of "all
aid-short-of-war to Britain." The
conflict over the bill has been bit
ter, and the old name-calling de
vices o fevery political dispute have
been brought into play.
The provisions of the bill itself
are vague, and it is this very
vagueness that has attracted the
major portion of criticism. Op
ponents of the measure hold that
its passage will make the Presi
dent a dictator, at least in every
thing hut name.
* * *
r JPHE bill as it originally appeared
before the House Committee
gave the President wide powers over
defense materials and anything that
has any connection whatsoever with
the defense program. Included un
der the definition of defense articles
besides actual implements of war
are "any machinery for the produc
tion, processing, repair, servicing or
operation of any article (and) any
component material or part."
In another section the President is
authorized to order any government
official to manufacture or procure in
any way any defense article, and
for any country the President de
sires. And this provision has a
"notwithstanding the provisions of
any other law" clause that makes it
the more comprehensive.
The President may also lend,
transfer, exchange, or sell articles
to any country, or have such ar
ticles repaired or reconditioned
for the use of any other country.
Likewise he has wide powers over
"defense information" — a term
which includes anything that is
remotely related to national de
fense.
At the same time the bill at
tempts to prevent foreign govern
ments, who have received materials
or information from the United
States, from disposing of these ma
terials (or their patents) or this- in
formation without the consent of
the American government.
To finance the carrying out of
any of the provisions of the bill,
the President is given what amounts
to a blank-check—to spend unap
propriated moneys in the Treasury,
And finally, the President may make
any additional orders necessary tc
carry out the bill.

HTHE issues involved in the con
troversy over the bill are per

In his speech at the opening of
Congress, the President asked the
American people to make the
United States an "arsenal for
Democracy." The bill that his ad
ministration proposes is aimed to
facilitate actions implied by his
words to Congress.
The President admits frankly tha
he wants to help Democracy—anj
country that resists aggression —
wherever possible. The bill, then
is more than a national issue. It i:
an issue that concerns all those wh(
are its potential benefactors. Th<
bill is of international, of universa
consequence, in the mind of th<
President and those who support it.
Throughout the 1920's and th<
1930's the United States pursued ;
course that might well be terme<
ultra-nationalistic. Tariffs weri

lease bill that has been stealing the
headlines for the past two weeks.
Hearings on the bill have been
going on before the House Commit
tee on Foreign Affairs for the past
few days, and Joseph P. Kennedy
and Charles McNary are among the
political leaders who have appeared.
The bill, in short, has been the cen
ter of the greatest controversy since
the November elections.
Most of those who oppose the bill,
as well as those who support it, fa
vor the general principle of "all
aid-short-of-war to Britain." The
conflict over the bill has been bit
ter, and the old name-calling de
vices o fevery political dispute have
been brought into play.
The provisions of the bill itself
are vague, and it is this very
vagueness that has attracted the
major portion of criticism. Op
ponents of the measure hold that
its passage will make the Presi
dent a dictator, at least in every
thing hut name.

r JPHE bill as it originally appeared
before the House Committee
gave the President wide powers over
defense materials and anything that
has any connection whatsoever with
the defense program. Included un
der the definition of defense articles
besides actual implements of war
are "any machinery for the produc
tion, processing, repair, servicing or
operation of any article (and) any
component material or part."
In another section the President is
authorized to order any government
official to manufacture or procure in
any way any defense article, and
for any country the President de
sires. And this provision has a
"notwithstanding the provisions of
any other law" clause that makes it
the more comprehensive.
The President may also lend,
transfer, exchange, or sell articles
to any country, or have such ar
ticles repaired or reconditioned
for the use of any other country.
Likewise he has wide powers over
"defense information" — a term
which includes anything that is
remotely related to national de
fense.
At the same time the bill at
tempts to prevent foreign govern
ments, who have received materials
or information from the United
States, from disposing of these ma
terials (or their patents) or this- in
formation without the consent of
the American government.
To finance the carrying out of
any of the provisions of the bill,
the President is given what amounts
to a blank-check—to spend unap
propriated moneys in the Treasury,
And finally, the President may make
any additional orders necessary tc
carry out the bill.

HTHE issues involved in the con
troversy over the bill are per
haps bigger than any of the mer
that discuss them.
In his speech at the opening of
Congress, the President asked the
American people to make the
United States an "arsenal for
Democracy." The bill that his ad
ministration proposes is aimed to
facilitate actions implied by his
words to Congress.
The President admits frankly tha
he wants to help Democracy—anj
country that resists aggression —
wherever possible. The bill, then
is more than a national issue. It i:
an issue that concerns all those wh(
are its potential benefactors. Th<
bill is of international, of universa
consequence, in the mind of th<
President and those who support it.
Throughout the 1920's and th<
1930's the United States pursued ;
course that might well be terme<
ultra-nationalistic. Tariffs weri
high; international co-operation wa
low.
What the President believes am
has in mind when he pens a bil
that will give him such unlimitei
powers is the complete abandon
ment of this policy. To him, it is
responsibility of the United States t
do its part in the ideological conflic
that envelopes the world; and thi
bill, he believes, will make his belie
possible.
