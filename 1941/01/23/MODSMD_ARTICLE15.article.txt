### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
More than 150 members of the j
"Stanford Family" honored Dr. Ray j
Lyman Wilbur yestei'day at a j
luncheon at the Bohemian Club in j
San Francisco celebrating the i
twenty-fifth anniversary of his in
auguration as president of the Uni
versity.
Those attending included Stanford i
alumni, professors, students, and
friends of the University. The meet
ing was arranged by Stanford Asso
icates, alumni group.
Dr. Wilbur surveyed the past and
outlined the prospects for Stanford's
next 25 years.
"As I let go the reins it is my
hope that some young and vigorous
man will take them and carry the
University forward into greater
days of usefulness to our people and
our nation," he said.
"Since the University had to do
with youth it needs to keep the
point of view of youth, to be ready
for change, to be full of vigor, to be
daring, to try the unknown, to be
industrious, and to be free from con
trolling prejudice," he continued.
INAUGURATION IN 191Â«
Dr. Wilbur was inaugurated as
president of the University in the
Chapel on Jan. 22, 1916. Only
Nicholas Murray Butler, president
of Columbia, has served longer as
the head of a leading American
educational institution.
Dr. Wilbur asserted that, though
Stanford was started as a personal
memorial, it required the lives of
Dr. Jordan and other members of
the "Old Guard" to build it into a
great institution. He said that the
University cannot be termed "pri
vately endowed."
"Actually it belongs to the public
and is gift supported," he stated.
WILBUR FORESEES
Entering upon prophecy for the
next 25 years, Dr. Wilbur predicted
a diminishing significance of the
bachelor of arts degree and a cor
responding emphasis on advanced
work. He also declared that there
will be "less real interest in the
various sideshows and much more
in the University as a whole."
"As one looks back over the 50
years of the life of Stanford Uni
versity, all the difficulties of the
past merge into a horizon with more
rose glow than blue in it. It is the
score that counts, not the ifs and
ands, the ups and downs. I think
that we of the Stanford Family can
all agree that Stanford has made a
good score in each one of its fifty
years," he said.
George A. Ditz, Stockton attor
ney and president of Stanford Asso
ciates, presided and Dr. Harry B.
Reynolds, retired Palo Alto physi
cian and classmate of Dr. Wilbur,
spoke.
