# West Lecturer Reveals 'Goods'
## Discusses Values Of Beauty, Truth, Love 
### 
Presenting to an eagerly atten
tive audience those qualities which
he considered "goods that are good
without any qualification," Dr. Ru
fus Jones delivered the second of
the West Lectures on "The Implica
tions of Man's Mind" last night in
Memorial Hall.
The "goods" which Dr. Jones con
sidered unqualifiedly good were
beauty, the sense of morality, truth,
and love.
BEAUTY UNIQUE
Before plunging into his discus
sion of the fundamental goods, the
lecturer told his audience that
"something unique, something
worthy of conservation was neces
sary to even consider the immortal
ity of man." In order to determine
these "somethings" an examination
of the word "value" was conducted.
Dr. Jones described the word as
"bedraggled and in need of a high
poWered bath of purification" to free
it from its current economic conno
tation.
Considering beauty, Dr. Jones
claimed for it a uniqueness derived
from the fact that it is unexplain
able by sense stimuli, that it must
be apprehended, appreciated by a
mind in order to exist, but that it
can't be reduced to a simple mental
perception. Yet, he maintained that
it is fully as objective as it is sub
jective. "It is as objective as the
Himalaya Mountains," he asserted.
KEATS RULED OUT
As for the sense of morality, "it is
the most august feeling in the
world," according to Dr. Jones. "You
don't become Adam, man, until
something of that order of 'must'
comes to you." He further defined it
as the tendency to transcend a given
situation. Differentiating it, he said
that matter shows no moral prefer
ence, rain would as soon fall on the
just as the unjust.
The noted philosopher would not
admit Keats' classic definition of
truth into his discussion. It does not
"pass outside the field of poetry, for
the two values, Beauty and Truth,
are in no sense identical, though
both are intrinsic goods."
LOVE INSTRINSIC GOOD
Pointing to the quality of Love
exhibited by Jesus Christ as the
type worthy of inclusion in the
classification, Dr. Jones said,
"Whether Love of that quality ap
pears it is an intrinsic good and it
belongs in the list of the supreme
value-realities."
Continuing, "It is a Love that
beareth all things, believeth all
things, hopeth all things, endureth
all things. It never fails, never lets
go. It is not provoked. It suffers
long and is very kind."
Dr. Jones will deliver the last
lecture tonight.
