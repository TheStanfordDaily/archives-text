# British Push Conscription Of Workers
## Churchill Confesses Lack of Manpower In Munitions Plants 
### 
LONDON, Jan. 22 (UP).—Britain
is "getting into its war stride" with
4,000,000 troops ready to repluse any
German invasion of the British Isles
—but there is a shortage of man
power in the war factories supplying
these forces with weapons, Prime
Minister Winston Churchill said
today.
Defending the policies of his
eight-man War Cabinet, Churchill
spoke in the House of Commons in
support of the government's drastic
new plan to conscript men and
women workers — by compulsion
where necessary—to speed up the
arms output.
REDUCE SERVICES
The armed forces, Churchill said,
may be compelled to reduce their
demands for greater manpower dur
ing the next six months to provide
workers for vita: industries such as
arms plants. .
The armed forces are enormous,
he explained, because in 1939 they
were set up along with a vast series
of plants and establishments with
the view of "continuous action on
the continent of Europe against the
German enemy."
Last June, however, the British
armed forces were driven of? the
European continent.
FACTORIES BUILT
Sufficient factories have been es
tablished to supply British armed
forces with all necessary weapons
and supplies, he said, and the 16th
month of the war finds 100,000 more
workers in munitions and aircraft
plants than at the end of four years
of the World War.
Harry L .Hopkins, personal envoy
of President Roosevelt, sat in the
gallery as Churchill spoke. In con
ferences during the last week they
are understood to have discussed
means of standardizing United
States and British arms production
under Mr. Roosevelt's pi'ogram of
"all-out" aid to Britain.
LABOR NEEDED
Supporting the labor conscription
plan, announced yesterday by Min
ister of Labor Ernest Bevin, Church
ill said labor must be supplied to
the new arms factories, to shipyards
and farms.
