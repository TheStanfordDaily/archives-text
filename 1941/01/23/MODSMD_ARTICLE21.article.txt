# Riabbi Irving F. Reichert Delivers Brilliant Speech To Spiritual Conference
## Leader Hits Mediocrity Of Preachers, Sunday Schools As Causes of Half-Empty Churches 
### ROSEMARIE MULLANY 
"Many people know the Ten Commandments hy heart, but have never
taken them to heart."
Thus citing one of the obstacles to the universal practice of religion,
Rabbi Irving F. Reichert of San Francisco delivered a brilliant speech
yesterday before the Stanford Conference on Spiritual Leadership.

Discussing the falling-away from
religion in current society, Rabbi
Reichert maintained that "the at
tack on religion is only incidental
in an assault upon the whole struc-

ture of modern society." His subject
was "Leadership in the Promotion of
Religious Faith."
MODERNIZE RELIGION
To attain a real leadership, out
moded church rituals and liturgies
will have to be modernized or their
importance in the services mini
mized in favor of the sermons. Above
all, Rabbi Reichert pointed out,
"The crying need in our time is for
unity. Unity in many things. Athe
ism is not a major problem. Apathy
is."
"What I am pleading for is a re
statement of the religious verities so
that they will bo intellectually ac
ceptable," he said.
POOR PREACHING'
Stressing the importance of
preaching in a church, the noted
rabbi said, "Mediocrity of preach
ers is responsible for the half
empty condition of our churches."
Dealing with Sunday school educa
tion offered at present, he remarked,
"When one considers the appalling
mediocrity of Sunday school educa
tion in America, the wonder is not
how many are outside the church,
but how many are in it."

cluded Bishop Karl Block of the
Episcopal Church, who conducted
the morning worship; Bishop Ed
win H. Hughes, of the Washington
Methodist Church; Dr. John Ben

Dr. Bennett gave scholarly and
thoughtful treatment to the difficult
übject of "Intellectual Reconstruc
tion." This rebuilding would take
place along four mental fronts, he
said; the concept of God, the con-,
cept of human nature, the relation
between Christianity and society, !
and the concept and construction of
the church.
In a fiery address, to which the '
term "oratory" could be justifiably |
applied, Bishop Hughes recalled for
his listeners his early church train
ing and held that churches are go- {
ing to have to re-exert their com
forting power.

sible relations in theology between I

fracas.

ways refer to it as 'European re
construction'."

Dr. Adolf Keller, last speaker in

the experiences of Europe and the

"Many people know the Ten Commandments hy heart, but have never

Thus citing one of the obstacles to the universal practice of religion,
Rabbi Irving F. Reichert of San Francisco delivered a brilliant speech
yesterday before the Stanford Conference on Spiritual Leadership.

Discussing the falling-away from
religion in current society, Rabbi
Reichert maintained that "the at
tack on religion is only incidental
in an assault upon the whole struc-

ture of modern society." His subject
was "Leadership in the Promotion of
Religious Faith."
MODERNIZE RELIGION
To attain a real leadership, out
moded church rituals and liturgies
will have to be modernized or their
importance in the services mini
mized in favor of the sermons. Above
all, Rabbi Reichert pointed out,
"The crying need in our time is for
unity. Unity in many things. Athe
ism is not a major problem. Apathy
is."
"What I am pleading for is a re
statement of the religious verities so
that they will bo intellectually ac
ceptable," he said.
POOR PREACHING'
Stressing the importance of
preaching in a church, the noted
rabbi said, "Mediocrity of preach
ers is responsible for the half
empty condition of our churches."
Dealing with Sunday school educa
tion offered at present, he remarked,
"When one considers the appalling
mediocrity of Sunday school educa
tion in America, the wonder is not
how many are outside the church,
but how many are in it."

ion, who dealt with "Intellectual
Reconstruction"; and Dr. Adolf Kel
ler, affiliated with Interchurch Aid, i
who spoke on "European Expe
rience."
Dr. Bennett gave scholarly and
thoughtful treatment to the difficult
übject of "Intellectual Reconstruc
tion." This rebuilding would take
place along four mental fronts, he
said; the concept of God, the con-,
cept of human nature, the relation
between Christianity and society, !
and the concept and construction of
the church.
In a fiery address, to which the '
term "oratory" could be justifiably |
applied, Bishop Hughes recalled for
his listeners his early church train
ing and held that churches are go- {
ing to have to re-exert their com
forting power.
Dr. Adolf Keller, last speaker in
the afternoon, spoke on the pos- j
sible relations in theology between I
the experiences of Europe and the
trend in America. At the outset, he
differentiated the points of view of
various countries on the present
fracas.
"In Germany," he said, "they al- j
ways refer to it as 'European re
construction'."
The conference will conclude to
morrow.
