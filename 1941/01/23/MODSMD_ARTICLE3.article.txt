# Sadie Hawins Dance Set Feb. 7
## 
### 
Ladies, choose your partners.
Cardinals last night approved the
night of Friday, Feb. 7, for the re
birth of last year's successful, riotous
Sadie Hawkins Day dance. Pat Ad
ams was appointed as dance chair
man.
Although a brainchild of the class
of '43, this year's Sadie Hawkins
Dance has been taken over by Car
dinals, at least for this year, to fa
cilitate rapidity of action since the
dance date is only two weeks away.
STRICTLY WOMEN
"This dance is strictly a women's
affair," Chairman Pat Adams said
last night. "The women invite their
partners, only women may buy bids,
and for the most part the dance
committee will be feminine. This
committee will be named within the
next few days."
Since Stanford plays Cal here in
basketball on the night of the dance,
all dancers attending the game will
wear their costumes, which will
range from gingham dresses to blue
jeans, anything in keeping with the
Sadie Hawkins spirit.
DETAILS LATER
As yet, due to surprise action, no
bid price has been set, nor has an
orchestra been selected, but the
dance will be held in the Women's
Gym.
Cardinals closed their usual Wed
nesday night meeting with a slight
rehash and revision of their constitu
' (ion, and a vote of thanks to Jim
Haugh, junior class president, for
his assistance in explaining the in
i tricacics of the forthcoming dance.
