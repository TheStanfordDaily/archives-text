# Small Schooners Battle Heavy Sea

### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 22 (UP).â€”
Heavy seas along the Pacific- Coast
today battered two small lumber
schooners, one of which managed to
reach port.
The S.S. Solano, of 94'J ions, limped
into Coos Bay at Marshfield, Ore.,
for repairs. The crew had manned
the pumps all night to keep the ves
sel afloat. r lhe S.S. Derblay of the
Alaska Steamship Company joined
the Solano and escorted her into
Coos Bay.
The other crippled schooner, the
S.S. Katherine Donovan, was riding
out the storm successfully off the
Northern California coast. The Coast
Guard cutter Shawnee of Eureka
j went to her assistance. The Kather
ine Donovan, with its engines dead,
wallowed in the heavy seas but kept
its head into the wind with the aid
of a sea anchor.
