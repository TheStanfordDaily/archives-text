CPLASHING around from one
sport to a wetter one.
Harry Wolter and his horsehide
crew must be getting pretty tired of
this endless precipitation. The Cards
don't start their season for a while,
but this is the time when they
should be working out regularly. It
takes a long period for a ball-player
to round into top shape.
Heavy rains this early, however,
often indicate an early spring. If
that comes to pass Harry will be
very happy.
The blame for some of the
Cards' lack of success last spring
might be laid on the unusually
tardy rains. Because of lack of
practice in hitting against good
chuckcn:, the club staggered
through its first few games prac
tically runless, the labor on the
mound of Cootie Thompson and
Claude Purkitt going for little
more than naught.
Last year's nine fared rather poor
ly in the league race, but baseball is
a game that always generates op
timism. All but two or three regu
lars will be back, and several good
prospects are coming up from the
frosh. If a couple of hitting out
fielders, a steady catcher, and
maybe a pitcher develop, the Farm
might find a championship ball
team on hand.
* * *
TUST a week from last night, next
Wednesday if you are in a fog,
the Farm will converge en masse on
the Pavillion.
Eoxing has been an extremely
popular sport on the Farm for some
years now, but the Circle S will find
more cash rolling in via the box
office this year than ever before.
Top attraction will be the VVard-
Lindskog heavyweight fracas, but

spectators will also witness many
other good bouts. With the novice
and the AU-U championships on
the same night, at least 12 bouts
will be held, .'Mi rounds minimum
of leather slinging.
Combining the two tourneys will
give the customers more for their
money, but it seems to hand a raw
deal to some of the novices. In the
past, with the events held at least
two weeks apart, a man could fight
in both. Under the new set-up the
best man in a weight may fight in
the novice division and be forced to
pass up the other medal.
As an example, take the case of
Frank Hewitt last winter. Hewitt
dropped a close decision in the nov
ice tournament to Blair Hyde. In
the All-University bouts some time
later he fought again and defeated
Jim Potts for the 145-pound crown.

I>AUL MOORE, distance star of
last spring's potent track aggre
gation, is returning to the spike
sport. Moore, whose races against
Louie Zamparini will not soon be
forgotten hereabouts, has sent in
his entry for the Wanamaker mile,
highlight of the Millrose games, in
New York. The date is a week from
Saturday, Feb. 1.
Paul may have some trouble
negotiating the board track, but
as holder of the world record for
three-quarters of a mile, he
should be able to give a good
account of himself.
With hard work and a good pub
licity build-up, Paul could develop
into a miler ca'pable of filling the
spot in track vacated by Glenn Cun
ningham. Whether he wants to or
not, I don't know, but he has all the
necessary physical equipment to be
the first man to run the oft-talked-of
four-minute mile.

tardy rains. Because of lack of
practice in hitting against good
chuckcn:, the club staggered

mound of Cootie Thompson and

Last year's nine fared rather poor
ly in the league race, but baseball is
a game that always generates op
timism. All but two or three regu
lars will be back, and several good
prospects are coming up from the
frosh. If a couple of hitting out
fielders, a steady catcher, and
maybe a pitcher develop, the Farm
might find a championship ball
team on hand.

TUST a week from last night, next
Wednesday if you are in a fog,
the Farm will converge en masse on
the Pavillion.
Eoxing has been an extremely
popular sport on the Farm for some
years now, but the Circle S will find
more cash rolling in via the box
office this year than ever before.
Top attraction will be the VVard-
Lindskog heavyweight fracas, but

spectators will also witness many
other good bouts. With the novice
and the AU-U championships on
the same night, at least 12 bouts
will be held, .'Mi rounds minimum
of leather slinging.
Combining the two tourneys will
give the customers more for their
money, but it seems to hand a raw
deal to some of the novices. In the
past, with the events held at least
two weeks apart, a man could fight
in both. Under the new set-up the
best man in a weight may fight in
the novice division and be forced to
pass up the other medal.
As an example, take the case of
Frank Hewitt last winter. Hewitt
dropped a close decision in the nov
ice tournament to Blair Hyde. In
the All-University bouts some time
later he fought again and defeated
Jim Potts for the 145-pound crown.

I>AUL MOORE, distance star of
last spring's potent track aggre
gation, is returning to the spike
sport. Moore, whose races against
Louie Zamparini will not soon be
forgotten hereabouts, has sent in
his entry for the Wanamaker mile,
highlight of the Millrose games, in
New York. The date is a week from
Saturday, Feb. 1.
Paul may have some trouble
negotiating the board track, but
as holder of the world record for
three-quarters of a mile, he
should be able to give a good
account of himself.
With hard work and a good pub
licity build-up, Paul could develop
into a miler ca'pable of filling the
spot in track vacated by Glenn Cun
ningham. Whether he wants to or
not, I don't know, but he has all the
necessary physical equipment to be
the first man to run the oft-talked-of
four-minute mile.
CPLASHING around from one
sport to a wetter one.
Harry Wolter and his horsehide
crew must be getting pretty tired of
this endless precipitation. The Cards
don't start their season for a while,
but this is the time when they
should be working out regularly. It
takes a long period for a ball-player
to round into top shape.
Heavy rains this early, however,
often indicate an early spring. If
that comes to pass Harry will be
very happy.
