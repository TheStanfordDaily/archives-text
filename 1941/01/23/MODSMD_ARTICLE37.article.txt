# Detroit Will Pay Bobo Newsom Baseball's Top Hurling Salary
## 
### 
DETROIT. Jan. 22 (UP). —Buck (Just Call Me 80-bo) Newsom, pitch
ing hero of the Detroit Tigers in the 1940 World Series, will be paid more
than $.'ls,ooo—highest hurler's salary ever known—next season by the
American League champions.
Club Owner Walter O. Briggs disclosed (he Ilartsville, S.C., right-

received $30,000 for his
services last season, and highly re
liable sources said Buck would get
at least a $5,000 raise.
Bonuses given liberally by the
wealthy automobile body manufac
turer throughout the season may
send Newsom's income to $37,000
it was believed.
RECORD lIIGII
The $35,000 figure topped the pre
vious estimated high of $27,500 paid
Lefty Grove by the Philadelphia
Athletics but there was some doubt
it would beat the sum said to have
been promised Bob Feller, speed
ball star of the Cleveland Indians.
Feller's salary had been reported as
"more than $30,000" but Indians'
President Alva Bradley, notified in
Cleveland that Newsom was to re
ceive $35,000, said only: "The ques
tion is, is he getting it?"
Bradley refused to disclose the
exact amount Feller would- be paid
on grounds it was "a private matter."
21 -GAME WINNER
Newsom's record last year was 21
victories against five losses. In the
World Series he won two games but
lost the last and deciding battle in a
pitching duel with big Paul Der
ringer of Cincinnati. He permitted
an average of only 2.83 earned runs
[ per game and was one of the big
factors in the Tigers' pennant drive.
Long known for his generosity
when making out contracts, Briggs
probably would have set another
top salary for Hank Greenberg if
the big slugger were sure we would
not be drafted.

DETROIT. Jan. 22 (UP). —Buck (Just Call Me 80-bo) Newsom, pitch
ing hero of the Detroit Tigers in the 1940 World Series, will be paid more
than $.'ls,ooo—highest hurler's salary ever known—next season by the
American League champions.
Club Owner Walter O. Briggs disclosed (he Ilartsville, S.C., right-

received $30,000 for his
services last season, and highly re
liable sources said Buck would get
at least a $5,000 raise.
Bonuses given liberally by the
wealthy automobile body manufac
turer throughout the season may
send Newsom's income to $37,000
it was believed.
RECORD lIIGII
The $35,000 figure topped the pre
vious estimated high of $27,500 paid
Lefty Grove by the Philadelphia
Athletics but there was some doubt
it would beat the sum said to have
been promised Bob Feller, speed
ball star of the Cleveland Indians.
Feller's salary had been reported as
"more than $30,000" but Indians'
President Alva Bradley, notified in
Cleveland that Newsom was to re
ceive $35,000, said only: "The ques
tion is, is he getting it?"
Bradley refused to disclose the
exact amount Feller would- be paid
on grounds it was "a private matter."
21 -GAME WINNER
Newsom's record last year was 21
victories against five losses. In the
World Series he won two games but
lost the last and deciding battle in a
pitching duel with big Paul Der
ringer of Cincinnati. He permitted
an average of only 2.83 earned runs
[ per game and was one of the big
factors in the Tigers' pennant drive.
Long known for his generosity
when making out contracts, Briggs
probably would have set another
top salary for Hank Greenberg if
the big slugger were sure we would
not be drafted.
