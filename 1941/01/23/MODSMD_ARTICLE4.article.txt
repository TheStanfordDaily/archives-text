# 'Daily' Acknowledges Prieth Misstatement
## 
### 
Tin* Daily takes this opportunity
to apologize to Benedict Prieth,
'31, for an error of fact con
tained in a recent article con
cerning Stanford graduates in the
United States Foreign Service.
The article fallaciously claimed
that at one time Prieth was a
member of the Nazi party. He was
not.
