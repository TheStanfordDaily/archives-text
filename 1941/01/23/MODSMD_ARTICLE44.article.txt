# Indian Cagers Hold Last Tough Session for Bears
## 
### 
In preparations for the first of the Big Game hoop series, Coach Ev- |
erett Dean sent his Indian cagers through their last tough session of the
week yesterday afternoon.
Anticipating a Cal outfit that will be playing above its head. Dean had
his first-stringers scrimmaging against a reserve quintet during a good I

of yesterday's drill. As the
j reserves, doing their best to play the
role of the Bear five, came down |
i court on offense, the Indians picked !
them up in a tight man-to-man de- j
i fense much as they worked against
the Trojans last week-end.
But every once in a while Chuck j
Smith or Tommy Fuller would lose j
his man on a block play and go all
the way in to the bucket for a lay- j
up shot, a trick that the Indians will
have to keep the Bears from ac
complishing very often.
i "BEARS' HELD DOWN
Little Ross Meyer played Merv
| Lafaille's forward spot as the re- j
i serves emulated Cal. but he was |
well held down by ihe guarding of
Kenny Davidson. If Davidson can
handle Lafaille, the Bear hot-shot,
nearly as well, it will be a big item !
! in the Cards' victory chances.
Big Bill Cowden was assigned to
[ rruard Roy Tamm, as played by
Fuller. Cowden, who looks to be one
of the best defensive men in the
conference, should not have a great I
i deal of trouble in handling Tamm
i this Friday night, for the Cal set
shot artist has not been hitting
the hoop too regularly this season.
WORK FAST BREAK
Although part of the scrimmage
featured defensive work, there was
also a good deal of fast break on the
part of the first-stringers in evi
dence, as the Indians forced the re
serves to pass wild as they picked
them up in backcourt. The Cards
look smooth racing down the court
on fast breaks in practice. The
question is, can they duplicate this
in actual competition?
From time to time this season
i Dean's charges have displayed that j
! smoothness, but at other times they j
have looked a little on the erratic j
; side as they tossed the ball around
! under the bucket.
FACE SPARTANS
Somewhat overshadowed by the
i importance of the Cal-Stanford game
this Friday night, is the contest the
Indians have with San Jose State
Spartans on the following night in
the Pavilion.
Down at State, Coach Walt Mc-
Pherson has developed a better than
average ball club, one which has
copped five out of six games played
this season. They have beaten I
Humboldt State twice, Utah State,
MofFett Field, and College of the
Pacific. Their one defeat came at
the hands of C.O.P. in the first game
of their series.
The Spartan first team is made up
of Captain Hal Carruth and Donald
Boysen at forwards, Dick Uhrham
mer at center, and Ernie Allen and
John Allen at guards.
Johnny Allen, who, by the way, is I
no relation to the other guard, is one !
of State's most versatile athletes. He
will be remembered as one of San
Jose's better footballers.
