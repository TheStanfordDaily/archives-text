# Frosh Hoopsters Prep for San Jose
## 
### 
As an indication of how Stanford's
frosh hoopsters may fare against San
Jose Saturday night, the Spartan
Cubs were soundly beaten Tuesday
by Menlo J. C.â€”a team that the
Card yearlings smothered, 38-13.
Coach Beebs Lee scheduled an
other scrimmage yesterday and the
boys went at it as if they were in
I a real game. Hank Hege, Johnny
Brooke, and Dick McDonough looked
pretty good against the first-string
team of Jim Pollard, Dick West,
Dick Middleton, Bill Hooper, and
Bob Wreisner.
