THE year 1941 signifies Stanford's "First Fifty-
Years" and, at the same time, it marks
twenty-five years of leadership under the guid
ance of Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur.
Yesterday was the anniversary of that Jan
uary day in 1916 when Dr. Wilbur walked into
the Chapel as first Dean of Stanford's Med
School and came out as the University's third
President. Today, a quarter of a century later,
Dr. Wilbur is still a tall, vigorous, incisive man,
scarcely aged by the burden of directing a great
University's complex organization.
And Dr. Wilbur is still, after twenty-five years
of dealing with youth's problems, a man with
young ideas. The tiring, trivial affairs that each
day have passed across Dr. Wilbur's desk would
have made an ordinary man a little bitter, weary
of students and their ways.
But such is not true of Stanford's President.
Dr. Wilbur's beliefs are still fresh and his reac
tions to student matters still healthy.
Stanford has completed fifty years of service
to the world of knowledge and opinion. Twenty
five of those years have borne the impress of
Dr. Wilbur's presence. And if, today, Stanford
stands in the top rank of America's educational
institutions, it owes an incalculable part of that
position to the work of its President.
If the man who will head Stanford next year
can remember a few words that Dr. Wilbur
spoke yesterday, Stanford may retain that place
always:
"Since the University has to do with youth it
needs to keep the point of view of youth, to be
ready for change, to be full of vigor, to be dar
ing, to try the unknown, to be industrious, and
to be free from controlling prejudices."
