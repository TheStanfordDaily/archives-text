# Outside the Shroud

THE scene can take place almost anywhere on
the European continent. It can be a Heinkel
bomber circling an English town, an R.A.F.
bomber over Germany or occupied France. It
can be an Italian Caproni bomber soaring over
a Greek city, or a Greek plane over Naples.
But whatever side is doing the bombing, all
objectives — military, economic, human — be
come the same denominator. An airplane can
only make an approximate aim at an objective.
If the aim is successful, good enough. If not,
there is another time.
Cable dispatches from the European battle
front constantly refer to the destruction of ob
jects that are no more essential to the successful
conduct of a war than is a Civil War rifle. Ger
many protests bitterly of the toll of human life
exacted from a British bombing raid made on a
locality "containing no military objectives."
The same complaint issues repeatedly from
Britain regarding Nazi aerial warfare.
That is a secondary tragedy of war, secondary
only to the tragedy of war itself. It is some
thing that the fatalistic person must shrug off.
The sword, as it has developed through the ages
into the potent weapon it is today, can no longer
afford to distinguish between its just and unjust
opponent.
It is a Frankenstein monster that must de
stroy, and it cannot control the path of its de
struction. Consequently, all that is good and
fine perforce must perish also. Civilization and
its component parts cannot exist side by side
with the sword.
Perhaps it is difficult for American college
students to realize their unenviable position.
Theirs is the last outpost of culture. In Europe
learning is in complete eclipse. Scientists de
vote their talents to methods of death and de
struction. Social scientists apply themselves to
theses justifying such horror.
Universities are closed, their windows
boarded over, their treasures put away, their
students killing. All the accumulated knowl
edge of the generations, and the universities
that preserve it, are common denominators with
munitions factories and strategic military ob
jectives.
This country must take over the burden of j

education, lest education die with all the other
things that war kills. American university stu
dents of today have an added obligation. Now
they not only are obligated to themselves, but
to the future of the world.
It is not to be expected that young Americans
will take this responsibility. It is beyond our
comprehension.
The realization must probably be born out of
actual experience, such as that of the European
student.
But the fact remains that when, and if, Ameri
ca's intellectual light is extinguished, the world
will be in cultural blackness.—G. M.
