### BUD AMES 
CONCRETE MIXERS AM) FULL DRESS
just start chatting along. There doesn't seem
to be a drastic need for carrying a fiery journal
istic sword today because all the committees and ad
ministrative heads and campus leaders in general have
just about exhausted themselves for this week.
Which, for no reason at all, leads us into a dis
cussion of what a great place this America is. But not
the stock stuff. You read it in the papers, you hear it
in the Cellar. "Aren't the American people a fine
race?"
People must see something worth while in this
place. If you need assurance of this fact you have only
to job once-over-lightly through the faithful Bawlout.
Every year, you see more and more people who come
here from other countries—or bits of land that once
were countries.
And on this campus today are two men—their
names could not be mentioned or relatives back home
would suffer—who have come here to your land of
the free.
* * * *
VTfHAT have these men seen? Well, some things you
carj't print. But here are some of the horrors one
of thesfe men had to face. (What follows is absolutely
true; it is the condensation of bits of conversation, of
things that people have heard.)
He was thrown into a concentration camp, and there
was forced to do menial tasks unfit to be printed. He
saw his mother lined up before a wall and shot before
his eyes. He saw his father shot; he saw his brother
shot.
Torture? Yes, he has seen men tortured, too. But
not in the old-fashioned trite manner. No. He saw men
loaded into a concrete mixer. Then the motor was
started. Round, round, ground the circular mixer until
the man inside was ground to death.
Finally he escaped—through political pull and a
few ingenious tricks. Today he is here on the Stan
ford campus. He works, and is relatively happy, in the
land of the free.
* * * *
A™ the other man?
Back there he would wake up of a morning and
find two uniformed—in full-dress, mind you—men
standing beside his bed. Nothing was said. He dressed,
ate, and then stepped into another room with the silent
men.
"Herr So-and-So," they would say, "three days ago
you were seen talking to Herr Blank. What was the
subject of your conversation?"
And he would answer.
And they would leave. Maybe they would be back
next morning, maybe not for a month. But they always
came back.
And his brother—well, he is a member of the first
divisions that went into Czechoslovakia and Poland.
And now he is here on the Stanford campus.
Why then, why then does somebody or some people
slink around and steal from the Infantile Paralysis
coin boxes? Or why—as was printed in a San Jose
newspaper a few weeks ago—did two men kick the
crutches from under a crippled newsboy and then steal
his coins.
Does it take concrete mixers and silent men in
full-dress uniform?
Which is a fiery sword.

Back there he would wake up of a morning and
find two uniformed—in full-dress, mind you—men
standing beside his bed. Nothing was said. He dressed,
ate, and then stepped into another room with the silent
men.
"Herr So-and-So," they would say, "three days ago
you were seen talking to Herr Blank. What was the
subject of your conversation?"
And he would answer.
And they would leave. Maybe they would be back
next morning, maybe not for a month. But they always
came back.
And his brother—well, he is a member of the first
divisions that went into Czechoslovakia and Poland.
And now he is here on the Stanford campus.
Why then, why then does somebody or some people
slink around and steal from the Infantile Paralysis
coin boxes? Or why—as was printed in a San Jose
newspaper a few weeks ago—did two men kick the
crutches from under a crippled newsboy and then steal
his coins.
Does it take concrete mixers and silent men in
full-dress uniform?
Which is a fiery sword.

just start chatting along. There doesn't seem
to be a drastic need for carrying a fiery journal
istic sword today because all the committees and ad
ministrative heads and campus leaders in general have
just about exhausted themselves for this week.
Which, for no reason at all, leads us into a dis
cussion of what a great place this America is. But not
the stock stuff. You read it in the papers, you hear it
in the Cellar. "Aren't the American people a fine
race?"
People must see something worth while in this
place. If you need assurance of this fact you have only
to job once-over-lightly through the faithful Bawlout.
Every year, you see more and more people who come
here from other countries—or bits of land that once
were countries.
And on this campus today are two men—their
names could not be mentioned or relatives back home
would suffer—who have come here to your land of
the free.

VTfHAT have these men seen? Well, some things you
carj't print. But here are some of the horrors one
of thesfe men had to face. (What follows is absolutely
true; it is the condensation of bits of conversation, of
things that people have heard.)
He was thrown into a concentration camp, and there
was forced to do menial tasks unfit to be printed. He
saw his mother lined up before a wall and shot before
his eyes. He saw his father shot; he saw his brother
shot.
Torture? Yes, he has seen men tortured, too. But
not in the old-fashioned trite manner. No. He saw men
loaded into a concrete mixer. Then the motor was
started. Round, round, ground the circular mixer until
the man inside was ground to death.
Finally he escaped—through political pull and a
