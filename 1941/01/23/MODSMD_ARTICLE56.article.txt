### AND THE WARMTH 
Y'HE EDITOR, SIR:
A master of review technique wrote from the
shack of The Stanford Daily yesterday. She is Audrey
Steele, Stanford review virtuoso, who has been de
lighting Stanford audiences since her debut on this
campus in 1940.
Unsmiling yet with a gracious mien, the reviewer
gave her interested readers a review displaying almost
infallible technique, done with typical American pre
cision. Steele was master of the typewriter at all
times, writing with thorough and painstaking care.
Opening the review with a comment about Casa
desus' rendition of "Schubert's Sonata in A Major,
Opus 120," Steele successfully imparted the warmth of
the pianist successfully imparting the warmth of the
composer's romanticism. All the readers seemed to feel
the emotion of the review.
