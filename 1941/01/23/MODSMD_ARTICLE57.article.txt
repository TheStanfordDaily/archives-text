r PHE EDITOR, SIR:
The subject of freshman grades and how they
may be improved has long been a topic of discussion.
I believe that there is a course given on how to study.
This is surely a good thing, but, as is the case of my
roommate (this is done with his full permisison) the
cause lies in the immediate surroundings of his place
of study. The following is a list of articles I found on
his none too spacious desk:
One desk lamp, one biology book, one copy of
"Microbe Hunters," one 1906 dictionary, two books of
lens paper, one short piece of glass tubing, one pair of
wire cutters, one bottle of ink, one ash tray, one
shoe horn, one calendar (1941), one meal ticket book,
one fountain pen, one bottle of cigarette lighter fluid,
one package of Egyptian cigarettes, two books of
matches (one empty), one sorority pledge extra, one
Frosh Bible, a coat hanger, several German papers, a
nail file, a flashlight, one Stanford Bookstore blotter,
two bicycle slips, a screw driver, a rubber anti
rattler, a benzadrine inhaler, a pair of cuticle scis
sors, a bottle of ink eradicator, a bottle of hair tonic,
a jar of brushless shaving cream, a small length of
serpentine, an unpaid doctor's bill, a pair of pliers, a
piece of wrapping paper, a piece of solder, a bor
rowed speech (9) syllabus, one broken yellow pencil,
two Western Civ books, one unopened package of
notebook paper, scattered ashes, one package of Luck
ies, an Oliver typewriter (1913 model), a copy of the
Constitution and By-laws of the A.S.S.U., a badly
cut-up Esquire, a copy of "Where to Sin in San Fran
cisco," one rooter's megaphone, three bottles of "en
ergy' pills, one burned-out flashlight bulb, a radio
and phonograph, one record ("Gloomy Sunday"), and
finally, an incense burner.
This conglomeration, coupled with the general at
mosphere of Encina, is probably the reason why my
"roomie" and several other "Encinamen" went slightly
(?) minus.
