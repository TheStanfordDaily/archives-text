# Arabian Night Fantasy Stars Sabu, John Justin
## 
### 
A flying carpet and a magic horse, a duel between a lad and a spider,
and even a Djinni 200 feet tall—in short all the wonders of an Arabian
Nights tale provide the charm of "The Thief of Bagdad."
From the start, the film is fantasy. Opening of the story finds the hero,
John Justin, a blind beggar walking the streets with his dog. The tale

of his deception by a wicked magi-,
cian, Conrad Veidt, and of how he
and Sabu, a shrewd little thief of
Bagdad, set out first to escape the
magician and then to rescue from
his clutches the traditional lovely
princess, in this case June Duprez,
is crammed with miracles and high
adventure.
SPELLS AND STUFF
To climax their already extreme
difficulties, Justin and Sabu are be
witched by the magician, the prince
losing his sight and Sabu becoming
a dog. When at long last the spell is
broken, the pair are faced by still
greater trials. Separated during a
storm at sea, and cast ashoi'e on an
island, Sabu finds a four-inch
Djinni sealed up in a bottle. He
pulls the cork and the Djinni re
solves into a 200-foot giant.
Though threatened with imme
diate destruction, the indomitable
Sabu by a ruse succeeds in bottling
up the Djinni once more and only
releases it when the giant grants
him three wishes. From this point
on, the story revolves around the ef
forts of Sabu to find the prince.
WELL PRODUCED
"The Thief of Bagdad" gives a re
freshing contrast to current war
films. The acting of Sabu is out
standing. Conrad Veidt is good in
the role of the magician, and John
Justin turns in a pleasing job as the
dethroned prince. The portrayal of
the Djinni by Rex Ingram is awe
some, and June Duprez does a cred
itable performance also.
The show might be more effective
if it were not quite so long, but
good acting, trick photography, and
technicolor make this Alexander
Korda production a topnotcher. —

cian, Conrad Veidt, and of how he
and Sabu, a shrewd little thief of
Bagdad, set out first to escape the
magician and then to rescue from
his clutches the traditional lovely
princess, in this case June Duprez,
is crammed with miracles and high
adventure.
SPELLS AND STUFF
To climax their already extreme
difficulties, Justin and Sabu are be
witched by the magician, the prince
losing his sight and Sabu becoming
a dog. When at long last the spell is
broken, the pair are faced by still
greater trials. Separated during a
storm at sea, and cast ashoi'e on an
island, Sabu finds a four-inch
Djinni sealed up in a bottle. He
pulls the cork and the Djinni re
solves into a 200-foot giant.
Though threatened with imme
diate destruction, the indomitable
Sabu by a ruse succeeds in bottling
up the Djinni once more and only
releases it when the giant grants
him three wishes. From this point
on, the story revolves around the ef
forts of Sabu to find the prince.
WELL PRODUCED
"The Thief of Bagdad" gives a re
freshing contrast to current war
films. The acting of Sabu is out
standing. Conrad Veidt is good in
the role of the magician, and John
Justin turns in a pleasing job as the
dethroned prince. The portrayal of
the Djinni by Rex Ingram is awe
some, and June Duprez does a cred
itable performance also.
The show might be more effective
if it were not quite so long, but
good acting, trick photography, and
technicolor make this Alexander
Korda production a topnotcher. —
Gile
A flying carpet and a magic horse, a duel between a lad and a spider,
and even a Djinni 200 feet tall—in short all the wonders of an Arabian
Nights tale provide the charm of "The Thief of Bagdad."
From the start, the film is fantasy. Opening of the story finds the hero,
John Justin, a blind beggar walking the streets with his dog. The tale

of his deception by a wicked magi-,
cian, Conrad Veidt, and of how he
and Sabu, a shrewd little thief of
Bagdad, set out first to escape the
magician and then to rescue from
his clutches the traditional lovely
