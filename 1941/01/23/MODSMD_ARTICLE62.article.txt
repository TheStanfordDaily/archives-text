# Wiley Loses Out; Clerk Misses Him
## 
### 
SALEM, Ore., Jan. 22 (UP). â€”
Aack Eakin, reading clerk of the
House of Representatives of the
state legislature, learned the names
of the representatives so well last
session that he has been bragging he
used the list to put himself to sleep
instead of counting sheep.
Today while calling off the names
begining with "W" he sang out
"Wiley."
Now his friends accuse him of
sleeping on the job, for Representa
tive Herman Wiley, of Lynn County,
is not here this year. He was de
feated in the general election.
