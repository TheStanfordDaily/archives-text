# Convalescents Receive $320 From Unknown
## 
### CHARLES BULL 
In this day of speed and sophisti
cation, one's faith in human nature
sometimes needs a little boost.
Mrs. Ruth Atwood, superintendent
of Stanford's Convalescent Home, re
ceived such a boost yesterday and
wanted the rest of the campus to
know about it.
Mrs. Atwood often receives small
contributions through the mail from
parents of children who have stayed
a few weeks or months building up
weakened bodies in the health-giv
ing surrounidngs of the Convales
cent Home.
NOT LIKE THE REST
But the other day came an en
velope with the regular mail ad
dressed to the Home and postmarked
"San Francisco." It looked just like
any other piece of mail.
But when Mrs. Atwood opened it
she found the following typewritten
note, unsigned, paper-clipped not
to a couple of dollar bills, or even
ten-dollar bills—it was attached to
three crisp, new $100 bills and a $20
bill:
"Dear Sir:
"Enclose you will find some bill.
Our child have been helped by the
Home before. I am glad that I am
able to pay back some that we owe
the Home. And i hope othei's will
be help with it."
Unsigned.
Just typed as printed above on a
three-inch strip cut with scissors
from a piece of typing paper.
Clipped to $320.
ADDRESS UNKNOWN
No one will ever know who
skimped and saved to make this con
tribution. But somewhere there is
someone that apprecia
tion, to be sincere and heartfelt,
needs no name attached, no formal
thank-you letter.
