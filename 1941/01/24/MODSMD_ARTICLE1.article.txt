### BOB LOW 
{ 'HARLES A. LINDBERGH voiced
his views on the President's
lend-lease proposal yesterday be
fore the House Committee on For- |
eign Affairs. The speech hit the
headlines in every community in the
United States.
Lindbergh, once the hero of mil
lions of Americans because of his
historic flight across the Atlantic,
yesterday showed himself to be the
man whom millions of Americans
will hate.
Lindbergh's opinions must be re
spected by every man as the opin
ions of a citizen of the United
States, but what becomes dangerous
is that many Americans give tre
mendous weight to his words be
cause once he flew alone across the
Atlantic Ocean.
Lindbergh was the first man to fly
the Atlantic, and it was this feat
which gained his fame. To Ameri
cans, he was an expert pilot, an
accurate navigator, a daring person
ality, and, above all, a modest man
who typified the American hero in
whom they wished to believe.
But Lindbergh yesterday did
not talk about airplanes (except
briefly); lie did not talk as an
expert engineer who perhaps
knows no superior the world over.
Lindbergh spoke as an expert in
history, diplomacy, and affairs of
the nation. Millions listened be
cause his name was Charles A.
Lindbergh.

the statements he made
are several which deserve ex
amination at this time while the de
bate on the measure goes on in
Congress.
He said, for one thing, that the
war in Europe is not our war, be
cause we had no part in declaring
war. But he said we encouraged
Britain to declare war.
He admitted that he had never
publicly denounced Hitler's policies
but that he had done so privately.
He said that we should not antago
nize any other country.
He hit out against President
Roosevelt's state-of-the-union ad
dress to Congress in which the
President said that we cannot hide
behind a "Chinese wall" of isolation.
Lindbergh said he believed the
United States can endure regardless
of what happens abroad.
Before many days pass, scores of
prominent statesmen will tear apart
the opinions of Lindbergh and give
Americans the other side of the
question. Yet, no one can doubt
Lindbergh's sincerityâ€” he repre
sents a portion of public opinion
which should be heard.
* * *
the aeronautical ex
pert, spoke as Lindbergh the
statesman, the diplomat, and the
economist. But if he had confined
his words to air power's part in
the dispute, his opinions would have
to be respected.
If Lindbergh speaks upon topics
on which he is not qualified to
speak, because he has a well
known name, it might be expected
that Golfer Bobby Jones, for in
stance, would speak on the size of
our navy or on how many guns
an airplane should mount.
While Lindbergh speaks on air
planes, his words must be listened to
carefully, for he is an expert in the
field. When he invades another
field, it must be remembered that
his words may be no better qualified
than those of hundreds of other
lesser known men who are not
heard although they are experts in
the particular field.
Lindbergh advocated a negotiated
peace in his remarks before the
committee, because he favored
neither side winning the war. Mu
nich was a negotiated peace, and the
world has seen its results.
At another time, he said that
trans-Atlantic bombing expeditions
were possible but not feasible now.
No one is more qualified to make
this second statement, but the first
must be recognized as just "an
other man's opinion."
