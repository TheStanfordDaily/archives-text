# Theologians Take Heed Of Students
## Religious Leaders Hear Campus View On 'Loss of Faith' 
### ROSEMARIE MULLANY 
Stimulated by the frank admis- I
sion of an undergraduate, Margaret
Tuttle, '42, that "everything is torn
down and the professor seldom both
ers to put it together again," the
Conference on Spiritual Leadership
yesterday came to grips for the first
time with a problem directly re
lated to University students.
Miss Tuttle had reference to the
number of students who lose their
religious faith after a year's en
counter with Western Civ. The sit
uation she suggested briefly in her
address, the assembled clergy sub
stantiated by their eager queries as
to how the situation could be rem
edied.
Asked how the church could min
ister more efficiently to the needs
of its young people, Miss Tuttle re
plied:
SUPERFICIALITY WON'T HOLD
"The deeper you can reach into
their spirits, the better. If you say
anything superficial you can't hold
young people."
Dr. Thomas Oliver, former chap
lain pro-tem of the University, rose
at this point in the meeting to say
tfiat fundamentally it was not the
function of the University to build
up the faith of young people. That
function, he maintained, was re
served to the church.
Rabbi Irving F. Reichert of San
Francisco contributed to the meet
ing by recalling numerous occa
sions when young people he had
taught in Sunday school returned to
him after being away at college and
complained that they had been told
that Judaism was "narrow, parochial
and tribal." In this context, he said:
STUDENTS. FACULTY EQUAL
"The religious education of a
considerable number of members of
college faculties has not in many in
stances been greater than that of
the students they are teaching. I
think it might be a very good idea
if some members of the faculty
would take the trouble of informing
themselves on these matters."
The question was then raised as
to how many of the clergy present
at the meeting had faculty members
in their churches. To a man they
agreed with the local clergyman
who said,
"I can count them on the fingers
of one hand."
FACULTY NOT WANTED
One minister qualified the above
discussion saying that among the
parishioners of the average church
there was a reluctance to see fac
ulty members join the church.
Among remedial suggestions made
at the meeting was one to establish
a pre-registration camp to which
incoming freshmen would be in
vited for a thorough discussion of
religious questions. The theory of
the suggestion was "forewarned is
forearmed." Also raised was the
question of what the undergraduates
themselves were doing to offset the
religious stumbling-blocks they en
countered.
FURTHER QUESTIONING
At one point during the eager
questioning by delegates of Miss
Tuttle, she intimated that all of
what was expounded in courses such
as Western Civ and psychology was
not detrimentally intended. She
drew an analogy to the bird that
is released from confinement into
the darkness of night in order that
he may be saved. "But the bird
doesn't know he is being saved," she
deplored, "and we, as students, are
in the same position."
Speakers at the morning session of
the Conference, which ended yes
terday, were Rabbi Edgar F. Mag
nin, of Los Angeles, who staunchly
maintained that church rituals and
liturgy should not be specifically
adapted to the needs of an apathetic
public.
"With all our faults, we have
something to offer. It is not for us
to mold ourselves to every Tom,
Dick, and Harry. We have some
thing to offer: the most precious
thing in the world."
Later, Dr. W. A. Brown gave a
thoughtful consideration of the pro
motion of fellowship in religion. At
the luncheon meeting, Dr. Ray Ly
man Wilbur stated that the world
needs a reassertion of human dig
nity. He declared that in his ex
perience he had decided that science
alone is not enough to lead to the
needed religious renaissance.
Preceeding Miss Tuttle, Bishop Ed
win H. Hughes of the Washington
Methodist Church spoke on '"train
ing for Social Action." He asserted
that in social action the church
should be an active leader and not
a follower.

Stimulated by the frank admis- I
sion of an undergraduate, Margaret
Tuttle, '42, that "everything is torn
down and the professor seldom both
ers to put it together again," the
Conference on Spiritual Leadership
yesterday came to grips for the first
time with a problem directly re
lated to University students.
Miss Tuttle had reference to the
number of students who lose their
religious faith after a year's en
counter with Western Civ. The sit
uation she suggested briefly in her
address, the assembled clergy sub
stantiated by their eager queries as
to how the situation could be rem
edied.
Asked how the church could min
ister more efficiently to the needs
of its young people, Miss Tuttle re
plied:
SUPERFICIALITY WON'T HOLD
"The deeper you can reach into
their spirits, the better. If you say
anything superficial you can't hold
young people."
Dr. Thomas Oliver, former chap
lain pro-tem of the University, rose
at this point in the meeting to say
tfiat fundamentally it was not the
function of the University to build
up the faith of young people. That
function, he maintained, was re
served to the church.
Rabbi Irving F. Reichert of San
Francisco contributed to the meet
ing by recalling numerous occa
sions when young people he had
taught in Sunday school returned to
him after being away at college and
complained that they had been told
that Judaism was "narrow, parochial
and tribal." In this context, he said:
STUDENTS. FACULTY EQUAL
"The religious education of a
considerable number of members of
college faculties has not in many in
stances been greater than that of
the students they are teaching. I
think it might be a very good idea
if some members of the faculty
would take the trouble of informing
themselves on these matters."
The question was then raised as
to how many of the clergy present
at the meeting had faculty members
in their churches. To a man they
agreed with the local clergyman
who said,
"I can count them on the fingers
of one hand."
FACULTY NOT WANTED
One minister qualified the above
discussion saying that among the
parishioners of the average church
there was a reluctance to see fac
ulty members join the church.
Among remedial suggestions made
at the meeting was one to establish
a pre-registration camp to which
incoming freshmen would be in
vited for a thorough discussion of
religious questions. The theory of
the suggestion was "forewarned is
forearmed." Also raised was the
question of what the undergraduates
themselves were doing to offset the
religious stumbling-blocks they en
countered.
FURTHER QUESTIONING
At one point during the eager
questioning by delegates of Miss
Tuttle, she intimated that all of
what was expounded in courses such
as Western Civ and psychology was
not detrimentally intended. She
drew an analogy to the bird that
is released from confinement into
the darkness of night in order that
he may be saved. "But the bird
doesn't know he is being saved," she
deplored, "and we, as students, are
in the same position."

The question was then raised as
to how many of the clergy present
at the meeting had faculty members
in their churches. To a man they
agreed with the local clergyman
who said,
"I can count them on the fingers
of one hand."
FACULTY NOT WANTED
One minister qualified the above
discussion saying that among the
parishioners of the average church
there was a reluctance to see fac
ulty members join the church.
Among remedial suggestions made
at the meeting was one to establish
a pre-registration camp to which
incoming freshmen would be in
vited for a thorough discussion of
religious questions. The theory of
the suggestion was "forewarned is
forearmed." Also raised was the
question of what the undergraduates
themselves were doing to offset the
religious stumbling-blocks they en
countered.
FURTHER QUESTIONING
At one point during the eager
questioning by delegates of Miss
Tuttle, she intimated that all of
what was expounded in courses such
as Western Civ and psychology was
not detrimentally intended. She
drew an analogy to the bird that
is released from confinement into
the darkness of night in order that
he may be saved. "But the bird
doesn't know he is being saved," she
deplored, "and we, as students, are
in the same position."
Speakers at the morning session of
the Conference, which ended yes
terday, were Rabbi Edgar F. Mag
nin, of Los Angeles, who staunchly
maintained that church rituals and
liturgy should not be specifically
adapted to the needs of an apathetic
public.
"With all our faults, we have
something to offer. It is not for us
to mold ourselves to every Tom,
Dick, and Harry. We have some
thing to offer: the most precious
thing in the world."
Later, Dr. W. A. Brown gave a
thoughtful consideration of the pro
motion of fellowship in religion. At
the luncheon meeting, Dr. Ray Ly
man Wilbur stated that the world
needs a reassertion of human dig
nity. He declared that in his ex
perience he had decided that science
alone is not enough to lead to the
needed religious renaissance.
Preceeding Miss Tuttle, Bishop Ed
win H. Hughes of the Washington
Methodist Church spoke on '"train
ing for Social Action." He asserted
that in social action the church
should be an active leader and not
a follower.
Stimulated by the frank admis- I
sion of an undergraduate, Margaret
Tuttle, '42, that "everything is torn
down and the professor seldom both
ers to put it together again," the
Conference on Spiritual Leadership
yesterday came to grips for the first
time with a problem directly re
lated to University students.
Miss Tuttle had reference to the
number of students who lose their
religious faith after a year's en
counter with Western Civ. The sit
uation she suggested briefly in her
address, the assembled clergy sub
stantiated by their eager queries as
to how the situation could be rem
edied.
Asked how the church could min
ister more efficiently to the needs
of its young people, Miss Tuttle re
plied:
SUPERFICIALITY WON'T HOLD
"The deeper you can reach into
their spirits, the better. If you say
anything superficial you can't hold
young people."
Dr. Thomas Oliver, former chap
lain pro-tem of the University, rose
at this point in the meeting to say
tfiat fundamentally it was not the
function of the University to build
up the faith of young people. That
function, he maintained, was re
served to the church.
Rabbi Irving F. Reichert of San
Francisco contributed to the meet
ing by recalling numerous occa
sions when young people he had
taught in Sunday school returned to
him after being away at college and
complained that they had been told
that Judaism was "narrow, parochial
and tribal." In this context, he said:
STUDENTS. FACULTY EQUAL
"The religious education of a
considerable number of members of
college faculties has not in many in
stances been greater than that of
the students they are teaching. I
think it might be a very good idea
if some members of the faculty
would take the trouble of informing
themselves on these matters."
The question was then raised as
to how many of the clergy present
at the meeting had faculty members
in their churches. To a man they
agreed with the local clergyman
