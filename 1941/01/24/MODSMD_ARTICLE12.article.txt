# Jones Asserts Plausibility Of Immortality
## Conclusion Reached In Final Lecture Of 1941 West Series 
### 
To the question that has always
loomed largest in the minds of men
—immortality—Dr. Rufus Jones last
night offered an answer. In the third
and last of the West Lectures he de
clared that men have every reason
to expect the existence of an over
world.
He deduced this conclusion from
the fact that man knows so little
about his "beginnings," yet is sure
of his existence; therefore he is
justified in supposing a carry-over
of some nature into immortality.
SUPREME 'GOODS' EXIST
Another springboard to a conclu
sion of immortality, according to
Dr. Jones, is the existence of a spir
itual world of reality which is evi
denced by the presence in men's
minds of such supreme "goods" as
Love, Beauty, Truth, and Morality.
The West Lectures were estab
lished in 1910 by Mr. and Mrs. Fred
West of Seattle, in memory of their
son, Raymond Fred, a member of
the Class of 1906, who died before
the completion of his college course.

there is something worthy of being
conserved."

spiritual world of reality, existing in
men's minds, offers material worthy
