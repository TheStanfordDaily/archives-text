The United States will enter the war.
So think 72 per cent of the Stanford student body. Twenty
eight per cent of thfe campus answered "the nation will not" in
a survey of student opinion conducted by The Stanford Daily.
Even more unanimous was the cross-section on the question
of aid to Britain. Asked "Do you approve or disapprove of 'all
aid to Britain short of war,' such as the Lend-Lease Bill?" 74 per
cent of the students approved and only 26 per cent were against.
A breakdown of the cross-section on the "war entrance" ques
tion reveals that more women than men believe the United States
will enter the war.
Yes No Undecided
Women 70% 23% 7%
Men 67% 33%
However, no direct trend is noticeable when the cross-section
is considered by class.
Yes No
Freshmen 71% 29%
Sophomores 53% 47%
Juniors 69% 31%
Seniors 73% 27%
Graduates 75% 25%

An analysis of the results on the "aid-to-Britain" issue indicates
almost the same proportion of voting as on the war question.
However, women approved of aid to Britain much more heartily
than the men. Approving all aid, such as the lend-lease proposal
of President Roosevelt, are 83 per cent of the women and 70 per
cent of the men.
Comments on entering the war were loud and many; a few of
the students insisted on qualifying their answers with lengthy
statements. Some of the comments were:
"It's just a question of weeks." "If we don't get in by sum
mer (and I think we shall), we won't enter at all." "I'm too
young to go and, thus, am not directly concerned." "I think
we'll get in the war, but I won't admit it in the guestionnaire."
A majority of the comments on the Lend-Lease Bill were favor
able, but a few opposed. "I approve of some aid to Britain, but
not the President's measure or any other which would be certain
to bring us into the war." "The President's bill is leading us to
war sooner, but I believe we would be dragged in anyway."
(Editor's Note: This is the first in a series of reports on a re
cent poll of student opinion conducted by The Daily. Tabula
tions on other subjects will follow in early issues.)
