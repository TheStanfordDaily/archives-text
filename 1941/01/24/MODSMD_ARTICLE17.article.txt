# Four Women's Positions Open
## Nominating Group To See Applicants 
### 
Women's Nominating Committee
will convene for the first time this
year Monday afternoon from three
to five o'clock in the Ex Committee
room to interview aspirants for the
positions of sophomore woman on
Ex Committee and for three Women's
Council positions.
The group will also meet on Tues
day and Wednesday afternoons from
one to five o'clock, and Thursday
from one to four o'clock.
The purpose of the committee is,
according to Martha Nordling, pres
ident of Women's Conference, to aid
in putting before the campus as
nominees women known to be ca
pable of whatever position they are
running for. This does not preclude
the possibility that qualified people
may be overlooked and if such is the
case they may circulate their peti
tions, securing signatures of fifteen
students, and run for the office.
Also announced yesterday was the
fact that anyone interested in being
interviewed by the committee may
appear on any of the above-men
tioned days or get in touch with a
member of the group to set a time,
or better still, according to Martha
Nordling, contact their living group
president.
The elections for which the pros
pective candidates are being con
sidered are the usual winter quarter
A.S.S.U elections. Nominations will
open on Feb. 4 and close Feb. 5. The
election will be held on Feb. 11.
