# Cards Favored to Cop Third Conference Tilt At Berkeley Tonight
## Farm Cagers Set for First Of Split Series 
### DON SELBY 
Odds-on favorites to cop their
third consecutive conference victory,
Stanford's cagers travel across the
bay tonight to meet the University
of California in Berkeley at 8 o'clock
in the first game of the Stanford-
Cal hoop series. Saturday night the
Indians take on the San Jose State
Spartans in the Pavilion.

Although the Bears have not been
very impressive in the games they
have played thus far, they are
gradually coming into their own, as
evidenced by their 47-34 win over
U.S.F. last Tuesday night. That
Coach Nibs Price's boys are im
proving is shown by the comparison
of the scores in the two games Cal
played against the Dons. In the
first contest the Bears eked out a
36-32 victory in contrast to the 13-
point margin that separated the
two teams Tuesday.
LAFAILLE SCORES HIGH
One of the main features of the
Bear win was the shooting of Merv
Lafaille, who rang the gong for 16
points, while his running mate at
forward, Roy Tamm, dropped in nine
counters. Bill Cowden and Kenny
Davidson, Stanford guards, have
their work all cut out for them. But
off past records, they are just the
boys to handle the job.
The chances are that the star Bear
forwards will find the going much
tougher against Messrs. Cowden and
Davidson than it has been most of
the time this season.
Perhaps quite significant in the
mediocre showing of Cal's cagers
this season is the absence through
graduation of Walt Bickerton, stal
wart guard of last season's quintet.
In the guard spots this year are Irv
Hodes, Dave Thurm, and Jim Bailey,
none of whom equal Bickerton when
it comes to popping the points.
U.S.F. HOLDS HODES
In the U.S.F. game Hodes' four
points were the only ones made by
the California guards, which may
mean that Everett Dean, Indian bas
ketball coach, will be able to con
centrate his team's defense some
what.
An Indian win tonight would fur
ther open the gap between Stanford
and the rest of the outfits in the
standings of the Southern Division
of the Pacific Coast Conference. At
the present time California is in
second spot with a win and a loss,
but if they are defeated tonight they
will drop into a three-way tie with
U.S.C. and U.C.L.A., for the latter
two teams take time out from con
ference competition this week-end
to allow the northern California
