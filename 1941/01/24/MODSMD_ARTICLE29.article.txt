# Vivid Colors Keynote Costume Designs for Shaw's 'St. Joan'
## 
### 
Color, color and still more color is the motif Mrs. Helen Green has
stressed for her costumes of the coming production of Shaw's "St. Joan," to
he presented in the Memorial Theater Jan. 30, 31, and Feb. 1.
Costumes, all authentic Gothic design of the flamboyant period, will
display a lavishness that has not been seen since the production of
t "Richard II" given last year. â–²

Colors are all of the deep jewel- I
like tones which were characteristic |
of the period when pride in costumes :
equalled the peacock's and head- |
dresses and shoes achieved absurd j
proportions.
The wardrobe for the show is one
of the largest ever attempted, with
all the costumes made by the stu
dents and in some cases made by
the actors themselves. And with all
the lavish display of cloth of gold
and silver, the total cost for the cos
tumes came to only $150.
Headdresses for the show are of
the huge and towering variety, tall
dunce caps, horned hats and jeweled
towers top the ladies, with the gen
tlemen not to be outdone in turbans,
soft Robin Hood shaped hats, and
the Bishop's hat a tremendous red
cartwheel.
Since the theme of the play builds
up to the burning of Joan, every
costume has about it something
flamelike. Sleeves have ragged
edges, capes are- slashed and jagged,
hats have zig-zag cut cockades and
cross-cut veils.
As the play progresses the cos
tumes grow in brilliance with the
only dull note being the costumes of
the Dauphin, who has no money, and
those of the Earl of Warwick, rich

and sombre in burgundy and gun
metal.
Armor forms a vital part of the
play's costuming, and cardboard,
silver and oilcloth are the basic ma
terials, but the creation is so real
istic you expect to hear it clank.
Joan's armor stands out among all
the rest as she wears a suit of blue
and gold among the duller silvers,
golds, and blacks.
Tickets for the play are still on
sale and may be purchased at the
box office or reserved by phoning
