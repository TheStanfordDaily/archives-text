# Lend-Lease Plan Called 'Suicide Bill'
## Hutchins Flays FDR Foreign Policy; Sees Drift Toward War 
### 
CHICAGO, Jan. 23 (UP).—Presi
dent Robert Maynard Hutchins of
the University of Chicago tonight
questioned whether the United
States has achieved democracy, crit
icized President Roosevelt's foreign
policies, and warned the nation it is
"about to commit suicide" by drift
ing into war.
"The President is reconciled to
active military intervention if such
intervention is needed to defeat the
Axis in this war," he said. "I hold

that the United States can better
serve suffering humanity every
where by staying out."
JUST 'AN AMERICAN'
Speaking "simply as an American"
and not as president of the univer
sity or the representative of any
organization, Hutchins addressed a
nationwide radio audience via
NBC's Red Network.
He charged Mr. Roosevelt's
speeches and recommendations are
committing us to obligations abroad
which we cannot perform; said the
nation is morally and intellectually
unprepared to go into this war;
charged the national government is
a government by pressure groups;
and said the "words 'short of war'
are ominously missing from the
President's recent speeches."
F.D.R. SUPPORTER
Hutchins has supported Mr. Roose
velt for eight years and has been
mentioned as a possible appointee
for various govei'nmental posts. He
said the speech marked his first
public assertions in those eight years
on national policy and the first time
he has publicly questioned the
President.
Hutchins said it is impossible to
listen to Mr. Roosevelt's recent
speeches, to study the lease-lend
bill, and to read the testimony of
Cabinet officers upon it without
concluding "that the President now
requires us to underwrite a British
victory, and apparently a Chinese
and a Greek victory, too."

CHICAGO, Jan. 23 (UP).—One
hundred and twenty-five members
of the University of Chicago fac
ulty tonight issued a statement
urging immediate enactment of
the "lend-lease" bill which, they
said, would empower President
Roosevelt "to take all necessary
measures to prevent the national
disaster which threatens us as long
as Hitler remains undefeated."

intervention is needed to defeat the
Axis in this war," he said. "I hold

that the United States can better
serve suffering humanity every
where by staying out."
JUST 'AN AMERICAN'
Speaking "simply as an American"
and not as president of the univer
sity or the representative of any
organization, Hutchins addressed a
nationwide radio audience via
NBC's Red Network.
He charged Mr. Roosevelt's
speeches and recommendations are
committing us to obligations abroad
which we cannot perform; said the
nation is morally and intellectually
unprepared to go into this war;
charged the national government is
a government by pressure groups;
and said the "words 'short of war'
are ominously missing from the
President's recent speeches."
F.D.R. SUPPORTER
Hutchins has supported Mr. Roose
velt for eight years and has been
mentioned as a possible appointee
for various govei'nmental posts. He
said the speech marked his first
public assertions in those eight years
on national policy and the first time
he has publicly questioned the
President.
Hutchins said it is impossible to
listen to Mr. Roosevelt's recent
speeches, to study the lease-lend
bill, and to read the testimony of
Cabinet officers upon it without
concluding "that the President now
requires us to underwrite a British
victory, and apparently a Chinese
and a Greek victory, too."

CHICAGO, Jan. 23 (UP).—One
hundred and twenty-five members
of the University of Chicago fac
ulty tonight issued a statement
urging immediate enactment of
the "lend-lease" bill which, they
said, would empower President
Roosevelt "to take all necessary
measures to prevent the national
disaster which threatens us as long
as Hitler remains undefeated."
CHICAGO, Jan. 23 (UP).—Presi
dent Robert Maynard Hutchins of
the University of Chicago tonight
questioned whether the United
States has achieved democracy, crit
icized President Roosevelt's foreign
policies, and warned the nation it is
"about to commit suicide" by drift
ing into war.
"The President is reconciled to
active military intervention if such
intervention is needed to defeat the
Axis in this war," he said. "I hold

that the United States can better
serve suffering humanity every
where by staying out."
