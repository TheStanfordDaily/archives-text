# Niccolls Out Of Swim Meet
## 
### 
The addition of several entries
from the junior class and the en
forced withdrawal of senior Bill
Niccolls from the diving lists point
to a victory for the '42 splashers in
the annual interclass swimming meet
tomorrow afternoon,
Niccolls was counted on to take
at least a second in the diving event
and split the points between jun
iors Howie Adams and Bill Gard,
while junior Burt Singer will give
freshman Tod Gardner an unex
pected battle in the 200-yard
breaststroke contest. Singer, a
transfer from San Francisco State,
has done a lot of swimming under
the colors of the Olympic Club, and
has turned in times slightly faster
than those of Gardner. While he
will compete in this meet, he will
be ineligible for competition.
The entrance of Hilleary into the
backstroke event will give at least
one or two more points to the jun
iors, giving them a possible ten
point margin over the sophomores.

Weeds annually cost California
agriculturists $50,000,000 in dircct
I crop losses and control.
