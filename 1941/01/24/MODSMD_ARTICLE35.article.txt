# Stanford Ruggers to Clash With Olympic Club Tomorrow
## 
### 
Tackling what will undoubtedly prove to be their toughest opponent
of the present campaign for championship honors, Stanford varsity rug
gers tangle with the Olympic Club Saturday afternoon at 2:30. Made up
of former Card stars, the clubmen trek to the Farm with the avowed
intention of smearing Stanford.
Stanford will field one of the strongest line-ups in recent years when
they take to the turf against the Clubmen. The front rank of the scrum

will see Franny Morgan, Paul Ugrin,,
and "Pop" Bernard, co-captain of
the aggregation, in the starting posi
tions. Combining speed with expe
rience, these men should all be
stand-outs in the tilt.
COLE MAY BE OUT
The rest of the forward pack will
be made up of Carl Gerlach and
Cameron Pierce, conversion experts,
in the second rank, with Ted Cole
and Bob Demailly holding down the
breakaway spots. Cole is handi
capped by the results of a fall on a
rainy sidev/alk Tuesday morning,
and in case he is not ready to go he
will give way to "Chick" Orme or
Warren Sleeper.
Ned Pugh will handle the all-im
portant breakaway position, while
Ed McCain and Dick Lyon will be
ready to fill in in case of injury to
any of the starters.
ALBERT TO PLAY
Frankie Albert will handle the
punting chores from fullback, while
Bob Olden and Ken Battaglia will
hold down the right and left wing
positions. Co-captain Jake Thomp
son will take over his old position
at halfback.
George Jedenoff will again step
into the first five-eighths post, with
"Skeeter Peter" Kmetovic back at
his last yeax-'s spot at second five.
Norm Standlee, slated to start at
center three, may not see action be
cause of a shoulder injury, in which
case the position will be filled by
Roger LaVerty. Reserves who are
almost certain to see action are A1

Wool, Lee Bickenbach, Art Geissler
and Bob Sengstack.
Due to the rainy weather of the
past week, the game will not be held
in the Stadium, but will be played on
either the new intramural field or
on the freshman football practice
field. The jayvees meet the power
ful Menlo Ramblers immediately
following the varsity tilt.
More than 28 billion board feet of
lumber will be required in 1041 for
national defense construction.

be made up of Carl Gerlach and
Cameron Pierce, conversion experts,
in the second rank, with Ted Cole
and Bob Demailly holding down the
breakaway spots. Cole is handi
capped by the results of a fall on a
rainy sidev/alk Tuesday morning,
and in case he is not ready to go he
will give way to "Chick" Orme or
Warren Sleeper.
Ned Pugh will handle the all-im
portant breakaway position, while
Ed McCain and Dick Lyon will be
ready to fill in in case of injury to
any of the starters.
ALBERT TO PLAY
Frankie Albert will handle the
punting chores from fullback, while
Bob Olden and Ken Battaglia will
hold down the right and left wing
positions. Co-captain Jake Thomp
son will take over his old position
at halfback.
George Jedenoff will again step
into the first five-eighths post, with
"Skeeter Peter" Kmetovic back at
his last yeax-'s spot at second five.
Norm Standlee, slated to start at
center three, may not see action be
cause of a shoulder injury, in which
case the position will be filled by
Roger LaVerty. Reserves who are
almost certain to see action are A1

Wool, Lee Bickenbach, Art Geissler
and Bob Sengstack.
Due to the rainy weather of the
past week, the game will not be held
in the Stadium, but will be played on
either the new intramural field or
on the freshman football practice
field. The jayvees meet the power
ful Menlo Ramblers immediately
following the varsity tilt.
More than 28 billion board feet of
lumber will be required in 1041 for
national defense construction.
Tackling what will undoubtedly prove to be their toughest opponent
of the present campaign for championship honors, Stanford varsity rug
gers tangle with the Olympic Club Saturday afternoon at 2:30. Made up
of former Card stars, the clubmen trek to the Farm with the avowed
intention of smearing Stanford.
Stanford will field one of the strongest line-ups in recent years when
they take to the turf against the Clubmen. The front rank of the scrum

will see Franny Morgan, Paul Ugrin,,
and "Pop" Bernard, co-captain of
the aggregation, in the starting posi
tions. Combining speed with expe
rience, these men should all be
stand-outs in the tilt.
COLE MAY BE OUT
