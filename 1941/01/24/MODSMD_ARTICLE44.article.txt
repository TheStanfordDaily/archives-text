WITH winter elections less than a month
away, Women's Nominating Committee is
opening shop again to give the once-over to
applicants for sophomore woman on Ex Com
mittee and three Women's Council spots.
The idea behind Nominating Committee is
simple: it eliminates democratic procedure and
establishes a board of nine that judges whether
or not a candidate is suitable for holding an
A.S.S.U. office. Hovering around the protective
skirts of Conference, Nominating Committee has
been able to hold this tyrannical sway over the
feminine political set-up for seasons now.
Candidates are interviewed by Nominating
Committee. Supposedly their records are dis
cussed. Their "interest in the position" is con
sidered by a group of so-called "impartial"
seniors.
And then the slate is drawn up.
The impartial seniors begin to do a little "con
sidering," which consists principally of horse
trading. It is natural that they should have pre
conceived ideas. It is natural, too, once their
choices are made, that they insure the election
of the women they pick. Time after time they
have packed the slate so that, in every classi
fication, it was inevitable that one woman would
be a cinch victor.
The proponents of Nominating Committee in
sist that it eliminates the caucus. If it eliminates
the caucus, it sets up a far worse thing —a small
group of women with arbitrary power over the
candidates for student-body positions —a super
caucus that makes no effort to be representative
or democratic . »
Perhaps the motive which inspired Nominat
ing Committee is founded in the belief that Stan
ford women are incapable of nominating and
electing their own Perhaps Conference
has decided that it can make a better choice
than the system of popular vote that has been
rather widely accepted in America.
Or maybe women just love to form com
mittees.
