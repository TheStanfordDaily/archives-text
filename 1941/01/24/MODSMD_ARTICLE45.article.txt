A.S.S.U. control of student social functions,
often characterized as an institution so gar
bled that even the most zealous cannot find a
solution, underwent a housecleaning last Tues
day evening.
Regulations, long the bane of Stanford student
groups planning a group affair but who, try as
they might, could not wade through the under
brush surrounding A.S.S.U. responsibility and
authority in such matters, were cut down to
what should amount to a workable minimum.
The "what should we do's" of club, house,
and group presidents were boiled down within
a basic three-point outline to which Excom ex
pressed immediate and complete satisfaction.
The three points of the skeleton outline include:
(1) Student body, class, and official group
affairs.
(2) Exchange dinners, open houses, firesides,
and the like.
(3) Hay rides, skating parties, and similar in
formal group functions.
In the innovation of the latter category, under
which fall most of the "misfit" unit functions
which group leaders find puzzling, lies the crux
of the rejuvenated system.
House presidents, with a house hay ride in
prospect, chew fingernails over whether the
rules call for the formal granting of a date, Ex
com approval, chaperones, and the other folde
rol necessary for a formal house function.
The A.S.S.U. vice-president, similarly grinds
her bicuspids over her digital appendages while
wondering how to keep the night of a Soph
Carnival empty of conflicting hay rides and skat
ing parties.
Point three of the skeleton outline should
smooth the foreheads of each.
Informal affairs of the type in question need

not go through the stereotyped route of the
more formal functions. What the new outline
calls for is a clearing through the A.S.S.U. of
these informal affairs in order to eliminate con
flicts as much as possible.
The "clearing through" will not mean the
granting of a date, approval by Ex Committee,
or the usage of one of the three on-campus and
one off-campus functions which fall under group
one. What it will mean is an end to the confu
sion of a Friday night with a Sadie Hawkins
Hop, two exchange dinners, and a skating frolic
all going full blast. It'll work, too.
Just call 8201 and ask for Anne Townsend.

Point three of the skeleton outline should
smooth the foreheads of each.
Informal affairs of the type in question need

not go through the stereotyped route of the
more formal functions. What the new outline
calls for is a clearing through the A.S.S.U. of
these informal affairs in order to eliminate con
flicts as much as possible.
The "clearing through" will not mean the
granting of a date, approval by Ex Committee,
or the usage of one of the three on-campus and
one off-campus functions which fall under group
one. What it will mean is an end to the confu
sion of a Friday night with a Sadie Hawkins
Hop, two exchange dinners, and a skating frolic
all going full blast. It'll work, too.
Just call 8201 and ask for Anne Townsend.

A.S.S.U. control of student social functions,
often characterized as an institution so gar
bled that even the most zealous cannot find a
solution, underwent a housecleaning last Tues
day evening.
Regulations, long the bane of Stanford student
groups planning a group affair but who, try as
they might, could not wade through the under
brush surrounding A.S.S.U. responsibility and
authority in such matters, were cut down to
what should amount to a workable minimum.
The "what should we do's" of club, house,
and group presidents were boiled down within
a basic three-point outline to which Excom ex
pressed immediate and complete satisfaction.
The three points of the skeleton outline include:
(1) Student body, class, and official group
affairs.
(2) Exchange dinners, open houses, firesides,
and the like.
(3) Hay rides, skating parties, and similar in
formal group functions.
In the innovation of the latter category, under
which fall most of the "misfit" unit functions
which group leaders find puzzling, lies the crux
of the rejuvenated system.
House presidents, with a house hay ride in
prospect, chew fingernails over whether the
rules call for the formal granting of a date, Ex
com approval, chaperones, and the other folde
rol necessary for a formal house function.
The A.S.S.U. vice-president, similarly grinds
her bicuspids over her digital appendages while
wondering how to keep the night of a Soph
Carnival empty of conflicting hay rides and skat
ing parties.
