WOMEN; FRONT AND CENTER
LAST the women have come into their own.
Committee after committee around this drenched
campus is named week after week. And then when
the key committee members are named, their first
name is always Joe, or Frank, or Ned, or Graham or
something equally masculine. And the women—well,
they get the dinky jobs, like painting scenery and
sawing two-by-fours. Lots of muscle work but little
credit.
So last year the Class of '42 (that's this year's Junior
class) put their collective heads together and came up
with something new in dance ideas.
And so, dea' readers, was born the largest legiti
mate race riot ever to hit the ivy-banked walls of
the dear old Farm.
A blast of battered trumpets, tra-taa, and there you
have the Sadie Hawkins Dance.

j AST night Jim Haugh, junior class president, chat
ted before Cardinals for close to half an hour,
chewing over the rebirth of last year's success. Should
the dance be given; would it be a success? Cardinals,
on the strength of last year's yeas decided yes.
Who should handle the dance? Haugh supported
the Class of '42, which had conceived and executed the
first dance. Cardinals leaned slightly toward yearly
putting the dance in the hands of oncoming sopho
mores. Finally, the middle course was taken—Cardi
nals took over, quickly naming Pat Adams chairman.
Undoubtedly some of her committee assistants will be
sophomore women.
But that is the important point—they will be women.
This whole dance bears the sign "For Women Only."
Women will paint the signs, and write the publicity,
and conceive the ideas, and sign the band. And the
women instead of the men will lay out their greenies
for the tickets, which naturally means that women
alone will select their partners.
Another example of freedom on the Farm.

B UT here is a note to these women to get off their
individual pantries and get hopping in an active
sort of way. The only date Cardinals could grant for
the dance is Friday night, Feb. 7, which is just two
short but oh-so wearisome weeks away from tonight.
Here is an opportunity for the women to pay back for
a few of those dates they are always mumbling about
paying back. Somebody, some time, must have bought
each Stanford woman a coke. So there should be a
100 per cent turnout—as with last year—at the Sadie
Hawkins Hop.
It won't be long now until you more fortunate males
(those having a larger coke purchasing power) will be
dancing in blue jeans and holding a nifty woman in a
Sadie Hawkins-Daisy Mae costume—which speaks for
itself.
And as for you men, why don't you ask some girl
to dinner on Friday night? Or, ask her to the Cal
basketball game. Then, just out of decency, she'll have
to ask you to the dance.
Even if you have to bring your spinster aunt from
Keokuk here to take you to the dance, don't miss
this knock-down-drag-out melee in blue jeans and
gingham, this crescendo of pigs, pumpkins, petrified
men, and powerful women.
