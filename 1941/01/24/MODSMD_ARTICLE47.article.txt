# CAMPUS OPINION
## WHERE'S YEHUDI 
### 
r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
It seems to me that Ychudi Menuhin, with a
wife and two children, should not be drafted; but
other Yehudis without dependents should go just the
same as any of the rest of us. Let them display their
talent in their own fields to the soldiers at the rate of
a dollar a day instead of going to the army camps to
give concerts at several hundred dollars a night. Very
few men who join the army ever get close enough
to deliver a bayonet jab — and believe me it takes a
lot of talent to deliver one successfully.
