# TABLE TALK

r |UIE EDITOR, SIR:
Encina food has long been a topic for "Campus
Opinion" columns. Moan, moan, moan about not
enough this or too darn much of that. Sympathetic
readers say, "Those poor underfed frosh; no wonder
they look so little these days."
Well, Encina has company nowadays. There are
approximately 100 girls that eat in the dining room of
the Union Unit who are slowly, but surely, starving
to death or dying from indigestion.
The by-word of the dining room is broccoli and
lima beans. And when it's not broccoli and lima
beans, it's chop-suey or sauerkraut.
Breakfast is worth getting up for once a week.
And that's the morning that they serve doughnuts.
But then we never know what day they're going to
give us doughnuts so we sleep through breakfast be
cause it's just too much to get up and face sticky
rolls and runny eggs. Consequently we have to cut
a class and spend our allowances on Cellar breakfasts.
At least they have doughnuts.
And then there's lunch. All 100 girls have to stand
in a never-moving line to get some pureed spinach
and warmed-over potatoes slung on a plate and thrust,
at them Or else we might get a combination salad
... a combination of everything that we've had for
the last two weeks with vinegar poured over it If
you like mayonnaise, just try and get it.
The bay-off is dinner. We do admit that sometimes
we get a good steak or a good lamb chop, but the occa
sion is so rare that we find it a topic for bull sessions
for a week hence. The nights that we can invite fac
ulty guests to dinner, we inevitably get a chicken
and noodle dish . . . that's what they call it. But
what does it taste like? Mucilage and erasers, with
little bits of pimiento interspersed.
We could go on indefinitely griping about our '
vittles. But the thought of it makes us rather ill
right now. We want some plain food and plenty of i
it. Just give us something that we can bear looking
at and we'll try to swallow it. Please don't make us
eat half our meals in the Cellar or downtown. Our
allowances can't afford it, especially since we pay
$150 per quarter for room and board. We just ain't
getting our money's worth.
