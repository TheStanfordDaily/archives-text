# Hudson's Bay Displays Muni to Poor Advantage
## 
### 
"HUDSON'S HAY," now playing
at the Fox Stanford Theater. This
is the story of Mr. Pierre Radisson
and his friend Gooseberry, who are
trappers and who are poor, but who
have discovered much beaver pelt |
in Hudson's bay, which they can j
not take advantage of because they |
are poor.
Mr. Radisson and his friend Goose
berry, after having a terrible time
trying to convince all the governors |
that there is much beaver pelt in
Hudson's Bay, finally convince a
young, banished English aristocrat.
With the young man's money and
the perseverance of Mr. Radisson
and his friend Gooseberry, the three
succeed in establishing a nice little
pelt business. Then there are fat
governors, jails, escapes, a tempera- j
mental king and his mistresses and
before you know it the little pelt
business has become the Hudson
Bay Company and the picture is '

I over.
Mr. Paul Muni was Mr. Radisson
and Mr. Laird Creeger was his
! friend Gooseberry. Mr. Muni, I dis
liked. He seemed mechanical, jerky.
! Besides his French accent or what
j ever it was, wasn't good. Mr. Muni j
| doesn't seem to be able to relax and
, play his part. He seems to always
1 be acting. His mind seems to be on
that Academy Award.
Mr. Creeger was very good, and
one of the biggest men I have ever
seen on the screen. Vincent Price as
the young aristocrat was also very
good and may go places. Gene
Teirny, whom I had been looking
forward to seeing for some time, dis
appointed me; not because of her
inability to act, but because there is
j something wrong with her face. I
think it is her teeth.â€”Saroyan
