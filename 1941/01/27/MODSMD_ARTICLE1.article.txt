jyj EMBERS of America's diplo
matic and cor iUlar service have
been observing conditions in Europe
for the administration in Washing
ton.
Recently, two •*** observers
have flown to Europe to report their
personal impressions back home.
The first of these was Colonel Bill
Donovan, prominent New Yorker
who was leader of New Yorker
"Fighting Sixty-ninth," and the sec
ond was Harry Hopkins, former
secretary of commerce.
According to dispatches received
in this country, Colonel Donovan is
taking in many of the European
capitals including those of the Bal
kan nations. Mr. Hopkins is in
London as President Roosevelt's
unofficial representative. Yesterday,
a third unofficial observer arrived in
London.
His name is Wendell Willkie.
"I want to see as much as possible
of production," he said on arrival,
"meet public officials, talk with the
people, and see everything I can."
Although Mr. Willkie's trip has
been called a personal sight-seeing
tour there is the possibility that it
is something more than that.
Prime Minister Winston Church
ill, it is reported, telephoned Mr.
Willkie in New York last Mon
day evening and extended him
something of a "bon voyage" and
a welcome.

from Rumania, and
neighboring Balkan countries,
continue to tell of a general state
of anarchy within Rumania.
Most of the reports are confusing,
but it is fairly well established that
an Iron Guard, pro-Nazi uprising is
in progress. Premier General lon
Antonescu, himself not unfriendly to
tihe Axis, evidently is trying to
squash the rebellion. What is far
from cle?r is what German troops
stationed in Rumania are doing, if
anything, to curb the disorders.
Some two years ago a rumored
Iron Guard revolt was put down by
King Carol — who last fall was
forced to abdicate. The leader of
the conspiracy two years ago was a
certain Oria Sima. When King
Carol put a price on his head, the
Iron Guard leader fled the country,
and did not return until he sneaked
back when Carol went into exile.
Last nights dispatches told con
flicting stories of the status and
whereabouts of Sima. One report
from Bulgaria said that Sima had
been caught near the frontier and
executed. But at the same time
rumors persisted that Sima was
still free, and in fact, continuing
the rebellion.
Loyal government troops were
said in another report to have cap
tured one Iron Guard stronghold
after a 50-hour battle.
So while conflicting reports con
tinue to pour in, the big question in
the minds of many is the German
army of occupation.
Not many weeks ago, Bulgarian
circles claimed that some hundreds
of thousands of German troops
were in Rumania, many of them
along the Bulgarian border. But re
viewing the reports more recently
which tell of practical anarchy in
Rumania, it becomes difficult to be
lieve that such a considerable force
of Germans is in Rumania. It is
hardly probable that strong German
forces could stand by and watch a
revolution going on about them.

<> N , the home front, the battle over
the President's "lend-lease"
proposal will be continued today
before the House Committee on
Foreign Affairs.
Senate leaders opposing the bill
{ire expected to ask President
Roosevelt to request the warring
nations to state their war aims, dis
close their peace conditions, and
"any and all secret treaties for dis
poistion of territorial spoils."
Three of the nation's top-ranking
military leaders will testify before
the House Committee today at a
secret session—secret supposedly to
prevent military information from
becoming public Some opposition
leaders believe Democrats want a
secret session to keep the answers
of these men on current foreign
policies and the status of the defense
program from reaching the public.
