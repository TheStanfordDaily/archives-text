# Series to Show Chinese Film
## 'Sable Cicada' Relates Story of Han Dynasty 
### 
"Sable Cicada," a Chinese motion
picture, will be pi*ojected for the
Tuesday Series followers tomorrow
night in the auditorium of the Me
morial Hall. Produced in Shanghai
with a cast of outstanding Chinese
stage and film stars, it is a magnifi
cent example of the traditional Chi
nese theater translated into a sound
motion picture.
The story, told in the manner of
the ancient story-tellers, is an in
teresting historical classic of the
Han dynasty. It is easy to follow,
and the Mandarin dialogue is ably
translated through the liberal use of
English titles. The Chinese musical
background and original dialogues
have been preserved intact.
"Sable Cicada" was given at New
York in 1939. It met with such suc
cess that arrangements were made
for a New York premiere in the
Metropolitan Opera House, the first
motion picture ever to be shown in
the exclusive home of the opera
and the ballet. The picture starts
at 7:30 o'clock.
