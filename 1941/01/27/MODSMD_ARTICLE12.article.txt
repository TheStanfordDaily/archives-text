## 
### 
Symphony for Stanford and California—symphony as you'll like to
hear it!
For the first time in the history of any symphony orchestra the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra will present a University "Pop" Concert
for Stanford and Cal students at the Opera House March 2.

The orchestra, conducted
Pierre Monteux, will play an en
tirely student-selected program and
it is believed it will be the lyric
type of music that will give new
symphonygoers a taste of sym
phony without having to undergo
the heavier numbers.
900 SEATS SOLD
Already 900 special student seats
have been sold by Chairman Dick
Lyons, graduate med student, with
out the benefit of publicity. He
predicted yesterday the Opera
House will be sold out. Stanford
has one-half the orchestra seats,
one-half the boxes, the entire Grand
Tier, and a limited block of seats
in the Dress Circle. The remaining
seats in the Dress Circle are on sale
at the A.S.S.U. office at $1.
"This will be the first time such a
concert will have been undertaken,
and the student enthusiasm so far
has been truly unexpected, showing
the students have been waiting for
something in this line," Lyons said
yesterday.
STUDENT MANAGEMENT
"The joint Stanford-Cal symphony
is being entirely student run, and it
is their ideas and enthusiasm which
are putting it over," he added. He
stated that the symphony has "cut
the heart out of the prices" in order
to make the affair possible.
Student enthusiasm for symphony
music has been steadily growing in
the past two years, and many Stan
ford and Cal students attend regu
larly, possessing joint-owned boxes.
TO PLAY HYMNS
Outstanding feature of the eve
ning's program will be special ar
rangements by the orchestra of the
Stanford and California hymns.
Many students are planning to
make the evening a date affair.
Approximately a week before the
concert, student leaders will present
a symphony forum on the Stanford
campus, to give students a back
ground on music and composers to
be heard. Recognized authorities,
including Mr. and Mrs. Monteux,
both artists in their own right, will
project their personalities into the
discussion.
Students who are in charge of the
affair include, besides Lyons, Brandy
Bassett, John Collins, Dan Hays,
and Johnny Piel.
Students are asked to make four
selections and send them in to the
A.S.S.U. office.

For the first time in the history of any symphony orchestra the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra will present a University "Pop" Concert
for Stanford and Cal students at the Opera House March 2.

The orchestra, conducted
Pierre Monteux, will play an en
tirely student-selected program and
it is believed it will be the lyric
type of music that will give new
symphonygoers a taste of sym
phony without having to undergo
the heavier numbers.
900 SEATS SOLD
Already 900 special student seats
have been sold by Chairman Dick
Lyons, graduate med student, with
out the benefit of publicity. He
predicted yesterday the Opera
House will be sold out. Stanford
has one-half the orchestra seats,
one-half the boxes, the entire Grand
Tier, and a limited block of seats
in the Dress Circle. The remaining
seats in the Dress Circle are on sale
at the A.S.S.U. office at $1.
"This will be the first time such a
concert will have been undertaken,
and the student enthusiasm so far
has been truly unexpected, showing
the students have been waiting for
something in this line," Lyons said
yesterday.
STUDENT MANAGEMENT
"The joint Stanford-Cal symphony
is being entirely student run, and it
is their ideas and enthusiasm which
are putting it over," he added. He
stated that the symphony has "cut
the heart out of the prices" in order
to make the affair possible.
Student enthusiasm for symphony
music has been steadily growing in
the past two years, and many Stan
ford and Cal students attend regu
larly, possessing joint-owned boxes.
TO PLAY HYMNS
Outstanding feature of the eve
ning's program will be special ar
rangements by the orchestra of the
Stanford and California hymns.
Many students are planning to
make the evening a date affair.
Approximately a week before the
concert, student leaders will present
a symphony forum on the Stanford
campus, to give students a back
ground on music and composers to
be heard. Recognized authorities,
including Mr. and Mrs. Monteux,
both artists in their own right, will
project their personalities into the
discussion.
Students who are in charge of the
affair include, besides Lyons, Brandy
Bassett, John Collins, Dan Hays,
and Johnny Piel.
Students are asked to make four
selections and send them in to the
A.S.S.U. office.
