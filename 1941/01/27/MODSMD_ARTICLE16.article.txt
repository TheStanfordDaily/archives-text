# Rain Threatens Lake, Robleites
## 
### 
With the promise of rain and
more rain, weary Farm students are
beginning to think that a raincoat
during Winter Quarter is as im
portant as a rooter's cap is during
Fall Quarter.
As the steady downpour contin
ues, Robleites in particular are cast
ing nervous glances toward Lake
Lagunita, swollen from the heavy
rains and nearing the high water
mark. Yesterday the water was
lapping the 37-foot mark. The
marker ends at 39 feet and so does
the embankment which separates
the lake from Roble and Lagunita
halls.
Precautions are being taken so
that the lake will not be in danger
of overflowing as it was last year
at this time. With the lake as high
as it is now there is no danger of its
drying up until late in the Spring
Quarter.
