# Card Cagers Stage Rally To Whip Cal
## Reserves Nose Out San Jose Spartans Saturday Night, 42-40 
### 
Staging a desperate end-game
rally after they had trailed for most
of the game, Stanford's conference
leading cagers handed the Univer
sity of California a 35-31 setback to
cop their third conference victory
in as many starts.
Don Burness was the big gun for
the Indians—and in no uncertain
manner. For while the rest of
the Cards spent most of their time
tossing the ball around outside the
keyhole, Burness pumped through
eight field goals and three free
throws to take high-scoring honors
with 19 points.
Friday definitely wasn't Stanford's
night to play ball, and the Bears
took advantage of the fact, turning
in the best game they have played
this season.
LAFAILLE SHINES
While the zones defense employed
by Cal might have had something to
do with the unexpected closeness of
the fracas, the unalertness of the In
dians cannot be attributed to the
Bears' defensive tactics. When it
came to ball-hawking, the Bears
were definitely superior.
Just as Burness stood out for
Stanford, so did Merv Lafaille and
Jim Bailey shine for Cal. The
former was practically the whole
Bear offense, especially in the first
half when he hit the hoop for 11
points, five less than his total for
the evening. Playing his best game
of the year, Bailey covered his de
fensive backboard like a blanket as
he took almost every rebound after
a Stanford shot.
However, Burness & Co. weren't
to be denied their victory after such
a good start in conference competi
tion. Going into the second half with
the score tied at 19-19 and then fall
ing behind after five minutes of
play as the Bears opened the gap
to five points at 21-26, the Indians
finally came to the realization that
they had to pour on the heat if
they wanted to come out on top.
CARDS POUR ON HEAT
And pour it on they did, popping
six field goals and two free throws
while holding the Bears to two goals
from the floor and a single charity
toss made good. During this period
Burness tanked three field goals,
two of them in the last couple of
minutes of play, and added a pair
of points from the foul line. A 25-
foot set shot and a left-handed push
shot by Donnie Williams, who got
back on his shooting game just at
the right time, and a field goal by
Bob Wensel on an out-of-bounds
play accounted for the rest of the
Indian scoring during those hectic
last minutes.
To Burness must go the plaudits,
for without him Stanford would be
a defeated team now. His offensive
rebound work and his shooting
from the pivot post kept the In
dians in the ball game Friday night.
The old saying about tfie night
being darkest before the dawn cer
tainly held true in the Berkeley
gym Friday night. For soon after
the second half started Co-Captain
Kenny Davidson was removed from
the game on four personal fouls—
the result of his attempts to stop the
very hot Mr. Lafaille. And it looked
like Stanford was doomed to de
feat. But the dawn came and so
did the Indians, as Cal tied up badly
when the Redshirt drive started,
missing no fewer than four easy
set-ups.
While the entire first team except
Burness sat in the grandstand Sat
