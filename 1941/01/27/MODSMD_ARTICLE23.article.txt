# Casualties Hit St. Joan Cast
## Replacements Found For Original Players 
### 
Assembling a cast for Shaw's "St.
Joan," which will be presented in
the Memorial Theater Thursday,
Friday and Saturday, has proven
somewhat of a headache for Direc
tor Charles Vance. Only relief has
been the excellent caliber of the
students found to replace those
forced to drop out of the play.
Most recent blow was the accident
befalling Dan Holtom, who was
scheduled to play the part of Cau
chon, the powerful chaplain who
caused Joan's death. Due to Hol
tom's accident, Charlie Bulotti has
volunteered to step in, so the cast
has not suffered.
Other replacements in the "St.
Joan" line-up will bring some new
names to Stanford audiences, and
also show the wealth of material
that has turned up for campus pro
ductions.
Keith Allan will play the part of
the haughty Duke of Tremouille
since Asher Wilson found his aca
demic load a bit heavy this quarter.
Bob Coombs has doctor's orders to
rest, so AJolfo Arias will take the
part of Bluebeard.
Sam Morford had to drop out of
the part of the Inquisitor because of
illness, affording Brownlee Corring
a chance at a good big role. Mel
Ellett, who was to have played the
executioner, has relinquished the
part ot Carlisle Kramer because of
boxing engagements he has taken
on.
In luck was Ted Marcuse, who got
out of the hospital in time to ar
range special rehearsals to allow
him to go on in his role of the Earl
of Warwick.
