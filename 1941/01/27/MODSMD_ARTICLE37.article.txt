DETROIT, Jan. 26 (UP).—The To
ronto Maple Leafs tonight increased
their lead in the National Hockey
League race by defeating the Detroit
Red Wings 2-0.
Fresh from a 31-24 victory over
the San Jose State freshmen Satur
day night, Stanford's yearling cag
ers tackle undefeated Santa Clara
tonight in the Pavilion at 0:30.
Boasting of wins over such pow
erful teams as Menlo J.C., U.S.F.
frosh, Cal frosh, and Modesto J.C.,
the Bronco babes will undoubtedly
offer Coach Beeb Lee's quintet its
toughest battle to date.
In grabbing their eighth scalp the
Card frosh ran into tough sledding
Saturday against San Jose, but
dead-eye Frank McCann solved the
situation with seven field goals, six
of them in the second half, to pull
the game out of the fire.
Clever guarding by both squads in
the first half kept down the scoring,
and the Spartans left the floor at
the gun with a 12-10 advantage.
A few moments after the second
canto tip-off McCann, Dick Middle
ton, Bill Hooper tallied in quick
succession to give the Cards a com
manding lead which was never re
linquished.
