## JERRY BRUCKER, Sports Editor Vengeful Krone Gagers To Invade Farm Tonight 
### 
As if they haven't had enough basketball this past week-end, Stan
ford's Indians take on the red hot Santa Clara Broncos in the Pavilion
tonight at 8 o'clock.
The Broncs are probably straining at the leash to get at the Cards,
who took them down a notch, .'{4-112, a couple of weeks ago. Add to that

the fact that Coach George Barsi's<
outfit will be seeking revenge
against a P.C.C. team for the 47-42
shellacking handed them by Cal
Saturday night, and you see why
Santa Clara is going to be a tough
quintet to handle tonight.
Even though they had a rest Sat
urday night after Friday night's
clash with the Bears, the Indians are
not as apt to be in the same condi
tion for a tough game as they would
be on a week-end. There can be no
doubt but what a battle as close as
the Bear-Card one was takes some
thing out of a eager.
Whether Burness & Co. can come
back and whip the Broncos so soon
is the big question.
On the other hand, of course,
Santa Clara was playing a speedy
game with Cal Saturday night while
the Cards were resting, so perhaps
the condition factors will balance
each other and the fans will get to
see as close a game as the last In
dian-Bronc contest was.
If Don Burness can get some help
on the scoring end the Indians can
play ball with Santa Clara any
time, although it must be admitted
that these two teams are as close to
being even in ability as any two
teams could be.
Stanford has Burness and Don
Williams for scoring. But the
Broncos have Bruce Hale and Jim
Rickert. No matter which way you
look .at it, there's going to be a
close ball game here tonight.
The probable starting line-ups:
Stanford Santa Clara
Anderson F Hale
Williams F Rickert
Burness C Mangan
Cowden G Feerick
Davidson G Passar'lia

Williams for scoring. But the
Broncos have Bruce Hale and Jim
Rickert. No matter which way you
look .at it, there's going to be a
close ball game here tonight.
The probable starting line-ups:
Stanford Santa Clara
Anderson F Hale
Williams F Rickert
Burness C Mangan
Cowden G Feerick
Davidson G Passar'lia
As if they haven't had enough basketball this past week-end, Stan
ford's Indians take on the red hot Santa Clara Broncos in the Pavilion
tonight at 8 o'clock.
The Broncs are probably straining at the leash to get at the Cards,
who took them down a notch, .'{4-112, a couple of weeks ago. Add to that

the fact that Coach George Barsi's<
outfit will be seeking revenge
against a P.C.C. team for the 47-42
shellacking handed them by Cal
Saturday night, and you see why
Santa Clara is going to be a tough
quintet to handle tonight.
Even though they had a rest Sat
urday night after Friday night's
clash with the Bears, the Indians are
not as apt to be in the same condi
tion for a tough game as they would
be on a week-end. There can be no
doubt but what a battle as close as
the Bear-Card one was takes some
thing out of a eager.
Whether Burness & Co. can come
back and whip the Broncos so soon
is the big question.
On the other hand, of course,
Santa Clara was playing a speedy
game with Cal Saturday night while
the Cards were resting, so perhaps
the condition factors will balance
each other and the fans will get to
see as close a game as the last In
dian-Bronc contest was.
If Don Burness can get some help
on the scoring end the Indians can
play ball with Santa Clara any
time, although it must be admitted
that these two teams are as close to
being even in ability as any two
teams could be.
Stanford has Burness and Don
Williams for scoring. But the
Broncos have Bruce Hale and Jim
Rickert. No matter which way you
look .at it, there's going to be a
