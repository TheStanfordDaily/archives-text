# Farm Ruggers Whip Olympics
## 
### 
Showing their followers much
better teamwork than they have ex
hibited heretofore this season, the
Stanford varsity ruggers were able
to hand the highly-touted Olympic
Club fifteen a 17-8 beating Saturday
afternoon.
Sparked by the brilliant punting
of Ail-American Frankie Albert and
the running of All-McLemore Pete
Kmetovic, the Indians held a 9-8
lead at half-time and managed to
score six more points in the second
period while keeping the clubmen at
bay. Albert personally accounted
for eight points, all of them kicks,
v/hile Kmetovic, Barnard and Jede
noff each scored touchdowns.
A much-improved jayvee squad
was able to hold the strong Menlo
Ramblers A. C. to a 6-6 tie.
With a little dry weather for prac
tice purposes this week, the Cards
will be able to get in the intensive
workouts needed in preparation for
the U.S.F. tilts next Saturday. It is
planned to have Norman Cleveland
and Jim Wylie each work one-half
of the squad on different fields all
this week.
