TNTER-OFFICE MEMO:

1 Dear Hutch:
In regard to last Friday's edit on Women's
Nominating Committee—Have you forgotten
that last spring, Women's Conference asked
each women's living group to discuss the value
of Nominating Committee, and to vote on
whether the campus should retain it? This
move was the result of criticism not unlike that
which you leveled at it, that the committee was
undemocratic, that it was unfair for nine women
to select the candidates for the campus to vote
upon.
The living groups voted for its retention.
They decided that the procedure by which the
Committee was selected (election by Confer
ence members representing their living groups)
resulted in a representative and impartial group,
and since their selections for candidates could
be augmented by any independent candidate
by means of petition (requiring only fifteen
names), the Committee was not a group with
arbitrary power.
Obviously this vote was not actuated by the
belief that Nominating Committee is the perfect
solution but that it is the best one so far.
Contrast Nominating Committee with the ear
lier caucus set-up. Houses advanced their best
candidates, and then by trading support for
support, a slate was made up.
Nominating Committee, composed of women
from five activities and six different living
groups and including past or present Excom
and Council members who know the requisites
these positions demand outside of enthusiasm
and the qualifications they require in return for
the prestige that goes with them, interview in
terested possible candidates. Resulting selec
tions are based on a girl's ability as shown by
her card file record of past living group and
campus activities and on her interest in and
knowledge of the position she is seeking as
revealed by her answers to Nominating Com
mittee's questions. The committee also deter
mines whether the girl will have the time to
devote to the position, or whether her interests
and time will be divided by other activities.
Quote Friday's edit, "Time after time they
have packed the slate so that, in every classifi
cation, it was inevitable that one woman would
be a cinch victor." You suggested that the com
mittee insured the election of the women they
picked by this means. There is no possible way
Nominating Committee can insure the election
of any candidate, but the campus has approved
the validity of Nominating Committee's choices.
For example, Nell Plopper was a committee
selection for a Council position last winter.
Through an oversight of Election Board, her
name was omitted from the printed ballot. Each
living group was phoned to tell members of the
mistake, and Nell won a write-in victory. Last
spring she was elected Chairman of Council by
the Council members.
In the past there was a natural reluctance on
the part of Hall women to run for high campus
posts. Understandably, too. The Row, much
more highly organized, saw that each member
of a house voted. The Halls, under-organized,
turned out very poorly. Naturally no Hall
woman cared for the ignominy of an over
whelming defeat. Under Nominating Commit

tee, the president of each living group turns
in the names of interested girls, and of people
whose names were not turned in who have the
qualifications and interest. This system has
resulted in a far more representative slate for
the past couple of years.
However, this does not mean that Nominating
Committee selects candidates on a Hall-Row
basis. Far from it. If you should notice next
Monday that the candidates for sophomore
woman or for Council positions all live north of
the post ofice on Lasuen, or all live in Lagunita
or Union, that will mean that Nominating Com
mittee felt those girls had the qualifications, in
terest and time to give to those positions, and
that the campus would benefit from having one
of the group in the spot.
But that won't mean that no one else will run.
Any other woman student of the necessary
scholastic standing may run upon Election
Board's receipt of a petition with fifteen signa
tures.
This isn't a defense in whole of Nom. Com.,
Hutch; it has its faults, but it is a defense of
the nine senior women who will be giving four
teen or fifteen hours next week in the interest
of the women students.—M. E. F.
