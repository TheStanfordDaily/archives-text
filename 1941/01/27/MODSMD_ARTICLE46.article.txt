f AST week was Juicier Apples Week. And this week
it's Know Your Professors Week.
Have you ever thought about the gymnastics that
your noble leaders in education go through in de
scribing the Three Punic Wars, or in pronouncing a
French vocabulary?
Of course, you have all heard of Professor Fagan,
the widget man, who flies over lowa on his chair, and
shouts down to all the lowa farmers, "Hey, down there,
how much corn have you got?" And in that way, Mr.
Fagan learns all about crop output—right in the chalky
classroom.
Oh, you've all heard about Mr. Fagan. But, he's
been getting all the credit for years now. It's time
that some of your other and well-beloved professors
took a few scholastic curtain calls. Each has an idio
syncrasy.
* it * *
Yt/ ELL, first of all there's Professor Boggs, a cohort
of Mr. Fagan. He's definitely of the "wipper"
class. Mr. Boggs walks into the classroom, claps on
his glasses, opens the textbook to the proper page,
jerks off his glasses, puts them back on, says hello,
takes them off, on, off, on . . . and then before you
know it, the hour is up, and everybody folds up his
newspaper and rushes to the Cellar.
And there's Gerald I. Jordan of the Political Science
department. He's the latiny, textbook type. Everything
is "ipso facto." Ipso facto, banana milk shakes are
yellow. Ipso facto, you are all going to flunk this
course.
But undoubtedly the best dramatist is your own
Professor Roth, a member of the "slip-over-a-quick
one" species. He paces as he lectures, and you can al
ways tell when a shady story is in the offing. Because
as the crisis approaches, he moves to the window, and
at the gag-line he lifts a bar of the Venetian blind and
looks out. Good suspense.

JJUT the Economics Department doesn't have all the
showmen. No siree, not by a long shot. If you
like music with your musing, just drop in on the
History Department's Professor Treat, the "jingle-bells
man." Always, always he has a dollar in small change
in his pockets which he jingles in his trouser pocket
faster than Lionel Hampton playing "Gin for Christ
mas" with a riveting machine.
But Mr. Treat realizes that he has stiff competition
in the Economics Department. So he puts on a doubly
brilliant performance by perching on just one leg as
he jingles his coins. And then, quick, he switches the
coins to another hand and his perching to the other
foot—and the house comes down.
It's always good for an encore.
And Professor Martin always gives a good perform
ance—tracing a red thread through the pages of Mexi
can history, or in asking Juarez what he wants.
And Mr. LeMaitre in his French class presents a
three-ring circus with his impersonation of the jovial
hero and the nasty villain sneaking to the door.
Well, all in all, your professors put on a good show.
It makes for more interesting classes. Now all we
need is a professor who can tap dance while lecturing.
Why, he'd play to packed classes every time.
