'T'HE EDITOR, SIR:
The paradoxical Mr. Low in his paradoxical col
umn entitled "History (not Opinions), 1941," proceeds
to tell us that Mr. Lindbergh, while competent to dis
cuss aeronautics, is in no wise qualified to give us his
opinions on foreign affairs. Mr. Low didn't say, but I
suppose the reason for the lack of qualifications on the
part of the latter was the fact that Mr. Lindbergh
had not taken World Politics (Political Science 133).
To continue Mr. Low's argument to its logical con
clusion, may I ask him how he reconciles the fact that
as an expert on tennis he feels so competent to formu
late a foreign policy for the United States.
Sincerely,
Bill Harrington
