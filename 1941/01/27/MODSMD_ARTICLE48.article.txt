# GREG VS. HARRINGTON

### 
r THE EDITOR, SIR:
There are some well meaning isolationists who
criticize the Daily's "Historian" because he thinks
Lindbergh is not a political scientist.
Such critics are confusing fact with wish. It is
perfectly obvious that if Lindbergh hadn't flown to
Paris and if his son had not been kidnaped, no one
would listen to his views on war. And it must be
equally obvious that those two feats—flying to Paris
and being the father of a kidnaped son—do not certify
anyone's immunity to political imbecility. But the iso
lationists think Lindbergh is an authority because he
agrees with them.
If one is an isolationist, why need he indulge in
such circular reasoning to justify his opinions? Rather
than attempt to make a political scientist out of a
pilot—an odd metamorphosis at best—why don't these
isolationists simply defend Lindbergh's views? If the
views are defensible, let them be defended. But let's
not sprinkle Lindbergh's words on war with holy
water just because he is a great flyer.
Ben Jonson once observed that if a gnat stings an
elephant, he is nonetheless a gnat. Gnats and Lind
bergh both fly, but neither is an authority on politics.
Gnats, I must confess, are less authoritative, though;
Lindbergh got a medal from Hermann Goering.
Sincerely,
Greg
