# Marcuse, Wilson Perform Superbly in Play Reading
## 
### 
Before we start out to say what was wrong with last Friday night's
reading of "The Gentle People"—and there was plenty wrong—we are
going to say that there was much that was worthwhile in it. Enough, in
fact, for us to he of the opinion that the readings are worth continuing, not
only for their intrinsic value, but also for the place they fill in campus

dramatics.
Stanford's production schedule is r
jammed full, and for that reason il ;
is next to impossible for interested I
people to see plays of this sort while j
they are still new. In the reading,
a living picture of the play, with
characterization, can be gained.
TWO ACTORS GOOD
However, if Ram's Head had read
"The Gentle People" for no other
reason than that it wanted to, the
play would still have been worth
hearing just for two characteriza
tions —Ash Wilson's Jonah, and Ted
Marcuse's Goff.
The different technique of read
ing makes the actor depend almost
entirely on inflection and facial ex
pression, but these two were excel
lent despite the limitations of the
medium.
Catching the musical cadences of
Jewish speech, Wilson's extraordi
narily flexible voice projected the
kindly, humorous understanding
personality of Jonah Goodman to
perfection. Marcuse made Goff a
grim killer, using casual de-empha
sis on certain lines to convey the
appalling lack of humanity of the
man "with a rock inside him."
HEROINE IMPLAUSIBLE
Emily Ruth gave a characteriza
tion of Stella Goodman, which was
interesting, but utterly implausible
as far as the play was concerned.
Making Stella a tough, hard little
babe, she utterly lost the motivation
for the repentant about-face at the
end. Jonah Goodman could have
had no sympathy for such a daugh
ter, and the only logical remark for
her to make after discovery of
Goff's death would have been
something like "Jeez, so I finally got
my name in th' pap-ers."
Donna Goodheart and Frank Burt,
both managed to carry the force of
their parts to the audience, and
would have been outstanding if they
were not being compared with Mar
cuse and Wilson.
With greater time for rehearsals
and casting, plus the experience
gained from this first effort, we
should judge that the next Ram's
Head reading will be something to
shout about.—Nowell
