## 
### 
Stars of this and last year's Gaie
ties—Dana Winters, Adolpho Arias,
Patty Bouchard, and many others —
are already working on songs and
skits which will brighten intermis
sion time of the Sadie Hawkins
Dance, Chairman Pat Adams an
nounced yesterday afternoon.
This dance, scheduled to shake the
boards of the Women's Gymnasium
Friday night, Feb. 7, from 9:30 to 1
o'clock, already promises a sell-out,
as Farm women show ever-increas
ing interest. Requests for bids will
be answered this afternoon at the
A.S.S.U. office where the total 500
bids go on sale. The price is $1.97 —
$1.95 for the woman and 2 cents for
the man.
TICKETS AT A.S.S.U.
"With regard to this ticket sale,
there has been some misunder
standing," Chairman Adams said.
"Tickets will be sold only at the
A.S.S.U. office, and not by the dance
representatives who are merely
promoting women's interest in the
dance.
"The men are already interested,
and waiting."
Bids will be sold only to women.
Women must invite their partners,
and no stags, either men or women,
will be admitted to the dance. Pat
Adams also stressed the importance
of buying the limited bids early as
many California students, down for
the Cal-Stanford basketball game,
are planning to attend the dance.

Dance, Chairman Pat Adams an
nounced yesterday afternoon.
This dance, scheduled to shake the
boards of the Women's Gymnasium
Friday night, Feb. 7, from 9:30 to 1
o'clock, already promises a sell-out,
as Farm women show ever-increas
ing interest. Requests for bids will
be answered this afternoon at the
A.S.S.U. office where the total 500
bids go on sale. The price is $1.97 —
$1.95 for the woman and 2 cents for
the man.
TICKETS AT A.S.S.U.
"With regard to this ticket sale,
there has been some misunder
standing," Chairman Adams said.
"Tickets will be sold only at the
A.S.S.U. office, and not by the dance
representatives who are merely
promoting women's interest in the
dance.
"The men are already interested,
and waiting."
Bids will be sold only to women.
Women must invite their partners,
and no stags, either men or women,
will be admitted to the dance. Pat
Adams also stressed the importance
of buying the limited bids early as
many California students, down for
the Cal-Stanford basketball game,
are planning to attend the dance.
