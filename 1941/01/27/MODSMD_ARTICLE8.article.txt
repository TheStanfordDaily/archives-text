# Stuart Backs New Power Granted F. R. under Aid Bill
## 
### CLAUDIA NETTLES 
Dr. Graham Stuart of the political science department yesterday de
clared that America's policy of self-preservation demands the emergency
power granted to the President by the Lend-Lease Bill now before
Congress.
Our policy to keep out of war comes second to our prime policy of

self preservation," Dr. Stuart
"Since we are now unprepared to
defend ourselves against the dicta
torships, we should give every pos
sible assistance to those states
which are checking the totalitarian
advance."
Although Dr. Stuart believes in
unlimited aid to Britain, he does not
think that the British need Ameri
can troops. Furthermore, he is con
vinced that the Roosevelt admin
istration is doing everything pos
sible to keep America out of war.
"I think Britain's ultimate victory
lies in her power to reduce Central
Europe to starvation by controlling
the sealanes," Dr. Stuart said.
"America can strengthen British
power by confiscating enemy ves
sels in our ports and selling them
to the English. We can freeze the
credits of enemy powers including
Italy, Germany, and Japan. We can
even repair British ships in our
ports. Although such aid is a viola
tion of international law, it would
merely be a retaliatory measure
against the totalitarian powers."
OPINION OF COLONEL
Charles Lindbergh's recent state
ment that the Lend-Lease Bill in
creases the risk of American en
trance into the war failed to impress
Dr. Stuart.
"As commander-in-chief of the
army and navy, the President could
utilize these forces to get us into
the war without any of the authori
zations in the Lend-Lease Bill, if
he were so disposed," Dr. Stuart as
serted. "I respect Lindbergh's au
thority on matters of aviation, but I
don't put much faith in his opinions
on world politics."
The argument that the bill es
tablishes an American dictatorship
is also of little consequence, accord
ing to Dr. Stuart. The centralized
authority granted to the President
is essential to the maximum effi
ciency required to combat the Nazi
war machine.
U.S. NEEDS BILL
"In emergency, a democracy is
weak because of its slowness to act,"
Dr. Stuart explained. "Totalitarian
states do not suffer from such a
handicap. The Lend-Lease Bill gives
the executive power to act
promptly."
Substantially, Dr. Stuart favors
the Lend-Lease Bill in its present
form. However, he sees no serious
objection to a time-limit of two
years.
"I approve of necessary debate on
this bill," Dr .Stuart said, "but the
sooner it can be passed, the better."

"Since we are now unprepared to
defend ourselves against the dicta
torships, we should give every pos
sible assistance to those states
which are checking the totalitarian
advance."
Although Dr. Stuart believes in
unlimited aid to Britain, he does not
think that the British need Ameri
can troops. Furthermore, he is con
vinced that the Roosevelt admin
istration is doing everything pos
sible to keep America out of war.
"I think Britain's ultimate victory
lies in her power to reduce Central
Europe to starvation by controlling
the sealanes," Dr. Stuart said.
"America can strengthen British
power by confiscating enemy ves
sels in our ports and selling them
to the English. We can freeze the
credits of enemy powers including
Italy, Germany, and Japan. We can
even repair British ships in our
ports. Although such aid is a viola
tion of international law, it would
merely be a retaliatory measure
against the totalitarian powers."
OPINION OF COLONEL
Charles Lindbergh's recent state
ment that the Lend-Lease Bill in
creases the risk of American en
trance into the war failed to impress
Dr. Stuart.
"As commander-in-chief of the
army and navy, the President could
utilize these forces to get us into
the war without any of the authori
zations in the Lend-Lease Bill, if
he were so disposed," Dr. Stuart as
serted. "I respect Lindbergh's au
thority on matters of aviation, but I
don't put much faith in his opinions
on world politics."
The argument that the bill es
tablishes an American dictatorship
is also of little consequence, accord
ing to Dr. Stuart. The centralized
authority granted to the President
is essential to the maximum effi
ciency required to combat the Nazi
war machine.
U.S. NEEDS BILL
"In emergency, a democracy is
weak because of its slowness to act,"
Dr. Stuart explained. "Totalitarian
states do not suffer from such a
handicap. The Lend-Lease Bill gives
the executive power to act
promptly."
Substantially, Dr. Stuart favors
the Lend-Lease Bill in its present
form. However, he sees no serious
objection to a time-limit of two
years.
"I approve of necessary debate on
this bill," Dr .Stuart said, "but the
sooner it can be passed, the better."
Dr. Graham Stuart of the political science department yesterday de
clared that America's policy of self-preservation demands the emergency
power granted to the President by the Lend-Lease Bill now before
Congress.
Our policy to keep out of war comes second to our prime policy of

self preservation," Dr. Stuart
