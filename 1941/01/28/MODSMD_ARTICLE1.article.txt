CONGRESSIONAL leaders, both
Democratic and Republican,
conferred with President Roosevelt
last night on proposed changes in
the British-Aid Bill now being dis
cussed before House and Senate
committees.
According to early reports, Mr.
Roosevelt was asked to accept a two
year limitation on the life of the bill
and an amendment that would re
quire the President to report to
Congress every 90 days on action
taken by him under the bill.
Another suggested restriction
that may have been discussed in
the conference last night is the
proposal to forbid American ship
Convoys in European waters. This
would technically he possible un
der the present bill.
In holding the conference, Mr.
Roosevelt took notice of mounting
objections by minority group
spokesmen to his attempt to have
the hill passed in as short a time
as possible. Included at the con
ference were both Senate Minority
Leader Charles L. McNary and
House Minority Leader Joseph W.
Martin.
Both of these Republican leaders
have voiced their opposition to the
bill as its now stands. The confer
ence at the White House last night
may have gone a long way to iron
ing out differences between opposi
tion leaders and-the administration.
If the conference was anything like
a success, both groups might be a
great deal happier — the opposition
bloc with restrictions on the Presi
dent's power under the bill, and
those in favor of the bill by its
speedy passage.

JAPAN'S lower house, which cor
** responds somewhat to the House
of Commons in England, several
days ago approved a resolution to
strengthen Japanese defense ex
penditures. Yesterday the same
resolution was passed unanimously
by the House of Peers.
Government spokesmen said that
Japan's policy was to stabilize and
establish a new order in Asia by
settling the Chinese "incident" and
thus "contribute to world peace and
human welfare."
But of even more interest to ob
servers in the United States is
the statement made by Premier
Prince Fumimaro Konoye, who
has been in office since the out
break of the conflict.
"The fact that the China inci
dent, which has entered its fifth
year, still is unsettled," he said, "is
neither the fault of the military
nor of anyone else. I am alone
responsible. I am determined as
my last public service to settle this
incident, which started during
my first cabinet."
This is a peculiar sentiment for
Americans used to hearing their po
litical figures disclaim any responsi
bility for past failures in office.
Members of parliament applauded
the prince's words.
For some time there has been
speculation in Japan that Prince
Konoye might resign. Certainly
these words diminish the possibility
of his resignation. If members of
parliament are behind him strongly,
there is little reason to expect a
change in the premier's office.

\V/ ENDEI L WILLKIE and Harry
Hopkins talked things over in
London yesterday. As far as could
be learned, their missions in Eng
land were the same: to find out what
actually is taking place in Britain
and report their impression as accu
rately as possible when they return
to this country.
Mr. Hopkins has been called Mr.
Roosevelt's personal envoy while
Mr. Willkie is supposedly making
the inspection trip for his own in
formation.
However, when the two men re
turn to the United States, Americans
will have information secured by
men of widely differing political
views. Disclosure of their impres
sions—excluding technical military
information—might well be encour
aged on their return.

CONGRESSIONAL leaders, both
Democratic and Republican,
conferred with President Roosevelt
last night on proposed changes in
the British-Aid Bill now being dis
cussed before House and Senate
committees.
According to early reports, Mr.
Roosevelt was asked to accept a two
year limitation on the life of the bill
and an amendment that would re
quire the President to report to
Congress every 90 days on action
taken by him under the bill.
Another suggested restriction
that may have been discussed in
the conference last night is the
proposal to forbid American ship
Convoys in European waters. This
would technically he possible un
der the present bill.
In holding the conference, Mr.
Roosevelt took notice of mounting
objections by minority group
spokesmen to his attempt to have
the hill passed in as short a time
as possible. Included at the con
ference were both Senate Minority
Leader Charles L. McNary and
House Minority Leader Joseph W.
Martin.
Both of these Republican leaders
have voiced their opposition to the
bill as its now stands. The confer
ence at the White House last night
may have gone a long way to iron
ing out differences between opposi
tion leaders and-the administration.
If the conference was anything like
a success, both groups might be a
great deal happier — the opposition
bloc with restrictions on the Presi
dent's power under the bill, and
those in favor of the bill by its
speedy passage.

JAPAN'S lower house, which cor
** responds somewhat to the House
of Commons in England, several
days ago approved a resolution to
strengthen Japanese defense ex
penditures. Yesterday the same
resolution was passed unanimously
by the House of Peers.
Government spokesmen said that
Japan's policy was to stabilize and
establish a new order in Asia by
settling the Chinese "incident" and
thus "contribute to world peace and
human welfare."
But of even more interest to ob
servers in the United States is
the statement made by Premier
Prince Fumimaro Konoye, who
has been in office since the out
break of the conflict.
"The fact that the China inci
dent, which has entered its fifth
year, still is unsettled," he said, "is
neither the fault of the military
nor of anyone else. I am alone
responsible. I am determined as
my last public service to settle this
incident, which started during
my first cabinet."
This is a peculiar sentiment for
Americans used to hearing their po
litical figures disclaim any responsi
bility for past failures in office.
Members of parliament applauded
the prince's words.
For some time there has been
speculation in Japan that Prince
Konoye might resign. Certainly
these words diminish the possibility
of his resignation. If members of
parliament are behind him strongly,
there is little reason to expect a
change in the premier's office.

\V/ ENDEI L WILLKIE and Harry
Hopkins talked things over in
London yesterday. As far as could
be learned, their missions in Eng
land were the same: to find out what
actually is taking place in Britain
and report their impression as accu
rately as possible when they return
to this country.
Mr. Hopkins has been called Mr.
Roosevelt's personal envoy while
Mr. Willkie is supposedly making
the inspection trip for his own in
formation.
However, when the two men re
turn to the United States, Americans
will have information secured by
men of widely differing political
views. Disclosure of their impres
sions—excluding technical military
information—might well be encour
aged on their return.
