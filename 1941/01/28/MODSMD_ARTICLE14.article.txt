# Tapestry Curtain to Highlight Lavish 'St. Joan Production
## 
### 
Stanford stage crews don't do things by halves when they prepare for a
production. This time they have been slaving for "St. Joan,"
Shaw's tragedy, to he produced in the Memorial Theater Thursday, Fri
day, and Saturday.
Biggest task for this show was the painting of an 1800-foot tapestry to

act as a front curtain for the play.<
The design was taken from an au
thentic Gothic tapestry of the early
15th century.
Students worked on the tapestry
over the Christmas vacation, under
the direction of Charles Vance, and
at the rate of 250 brush strokes per
square foot you can figure the labor
it took. Different lighting effects
will pick out the rich colors of the
tapestry to follow out the mood of
the scenes that follow.
VANCE DESIGNS SETS
Immense sets representing the 15th
century Gothic have been designed
by Charles Vance, director of the
play. Most of them will simulate
gray stone, an appropriate cold
background to set off the rich col
ors of the costumes.
Flanking the tapestry on either
side will be two towering stone
Gothic warriors, cleverly constructed
of chicken wire, flannel, sawdust,
glue and plaster to simulate stone.
Another statue especially con
'structed will be the virgin and
child for the church scene. All the
interiors will be of different gray
tones with the exception of the tent
scene.
TENT SHOW?
In the scene where the Earl of
Warwick, Cauchon and Stogumber
plot Joan's downfall because her na
tionalistic convictions will bring
about the downfall of church and
feudal state, action will take place
in a burgundy tent, crestcd in sil
ver and supported by a tent pole of
heraldic blue and red.
Gold encrusted velvet banners
will carry out the theme of the play
in several scenes, with crests and
flags of the period. Lifelike effects
will be produced in the tent scene
by a brazier of glowing coals as the
only lighting in that scene.
WIND MACHINES, TOO
Even a wind machine has been
constructed for the Battle of Orleans,
in which the soldiers pray for a West
wind; when Joan appears to lead
the men, the wind changes and her
white banner floats toward the
walls of the city, presaging victory.
Music for the play will not be of
the period, but has been selected to
reflect the moods of the scenes. Bill
Bassett has been in charge of the
construction under Mr. Vance, and
Elena Madison is head of properties.
Jim Walters and Carleton Cross will
supervise the lighting effects.
Tickets for the play are still avail
able and may be obtained by calling
at the box office or by telephoning
Mr. Barker at P.A. 22041. Best seats
are available for the opening night
Thursday.
