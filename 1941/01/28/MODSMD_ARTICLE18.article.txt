# Sirens Shriek, Quad Smokes, Firemen Burn
## 
### 
Sirens screaming, the three cam
pus fire trucks roared out of the
station at 7:20 o'clock yesterday
morning in answer to a telephone
call reporting a fire on the Quad.
When the fire wagons arrived in
the Inner Quad, a very scared
woman pointed to the Arts and Let
ters Building next to the Chapel.
Smoke was pouring out of the win
dows and from under the doors.
The firemen, wearing their heavy
boots and fire jackets, stood ready
for action while Captain Hat Hatley
entered the smoke-filled building.
Minutes passed. It looked like a big
one. Hoses were unrolled.
Then the captain came out drip
ping with water. "Call a plumber,
chief, a steam pipe has busted."
According to Mr. J. W. McDon
nell, superintendent of buildings
and grounds, woodwork and plaster
were damaged in two rooms of the
building. Actual costs can not be
determined until the walls and ceil
ing have dried.
