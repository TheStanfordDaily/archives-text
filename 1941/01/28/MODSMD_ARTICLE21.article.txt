# Rush Penalty Rules Clarified By Panhellenic
## Pledging Contract Lists Punishments, Alumna Tells Council 
### 
Penalties which were inflicted on
the five houses having illegal con
tact with rushees during this year's
sorority rushing are those specified
in the Panhellenic bidding contract,
Mrs. Joseph W. Bingham, president
of the Palo Alto Alumnae Council,
told Stanford's Panhellenic Council
yesterday. Since every sorority girl
is required to know the contract,
each house was cognizant of the
punishment involved when it vio
lated rushing rules, she declared.
Mrs. Bingham, a member of the
joint committee which inflicted the
penalties, appeared before the meet
ing to clarify the system of punish
ment because many questions had
been raised concerning technicalities.
RULES CLARIFIED
Such questions as whether or not
a house could have guests for Fri
day lunch instead of Sunday night
supper showed that the sororities
did not understand the spirit of the
punishment inflicted, Mrs. Bingham
said.
The following specific rules which
will hold until spring quarter were
set down by the special committee:
1. No rushing of any kind, not
even through house pledges in Roble.
This includes unnecessary contact
with Roble girls by sorority mem
bers.
NO ENTERTAINING
2. No entertaining of any kind, in
cluding teas, dances, exchange din
ners, Sunday night suppers, or en
tertainment of faculty members or
administration officers. Entertaining
by or for the alumnae is strictly for
bidden. Both alumnae groups and
mothers' clubs may hold business
meetings in the house, but may not
be entertained at tea by house mem
bers.

All appeals for leniency in special
cases are to be presented to the
special committee which consists of
Mrs. Bingham, Dean Yost, Panhel
lenic President Peggy Stanfield, and
two senior members of Panhellenic.
