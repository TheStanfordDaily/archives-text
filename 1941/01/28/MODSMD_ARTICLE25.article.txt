### 
VICHY, Jan. 24 (UP). —An end of the month-old stalemate in relations

cabinet and reports that a message from Hitler was en route to Vichy.
Minister of Justice Raphael Alibert and Minister of Labor Rene Belin

on Dec. 14 was about to be healed.
NO PROGRESS
There has been no progress in
French - German relations since
Laval's ouster, leading to many
wild reports abroad regarding Ger
man demands. The Petain govern
ment has insisted, however, that it
refuses to turn over its fleet for use
against Britain and that it demands
rigid observance of the French-
German armistice accord.
Petain's new constitutional act
provides:
1. Ministers and high state func
tionaries must take an oath before
Petain "swearing fidelity to his per
son."
2. All officials will be personally
responsible to Petain—a responsibil
ity "embracing their persons and
their property."
FULL AUTHORITY
3. In event of "betrayals" Petain
will have full authority to hand out
punishment as he desires, pronounc
ing "whatever civil reparations are
to be made."
4. The extraordinary powers vest
ed in Petain will not prevent ordi
nary legal procedure from func
tioning against the accused.
5. The penalties may be applied
not only to those officials in office
now and in the future but "to former
ministers, high dignitaries and high
functionaries who have been in of
fice during the past 10 years."

VICHY, Jan. 24 (UP). —An end of the month-old stalemate in relations
between Adolf Hitler and the French government appeared imminent to
night. There was a yew shake-up in Marshal Henri Philippe Petain's
cabinet and reports that a message from Hitler was en route to Vichy.
Minister of Justice Raphael Alibert and Minister of Labor Rene Belin

.resigned from the Cabinet Monday,
following bitter accusations in
Nazi-held Paris that they had been
blocking French-German collabora
tion.
Hitler's message, the resignations
of Alibert and Belin and the recent
reconciliation between Marshal Pe
tain and Laval indicated that a
break in the deadlock which devel
oped atfer Laval's ouster as French
vice-premier and foreign minister
on Dec. 14 was about to be healed.
NO PROGRESS
There has been no progress in
French - German relations since
Laval's ouster, leading to many
wild reports abroad regarding Ger
man demands. The Petain govern
ment has insisted, however, that it
refuses to turn over its fleet for use
against Britain and that it demands
rigid observance of the French-
German armistice accord.
Petain's new constitutional act
provides:
1. Ministers and high state func
tionaries must take an oath before
Petain "swearing fidelity to his per
son."
2. All officials will be personally
responsible to Petain—a responsibil
ity "embracing their persons and
their property."
