### 
MIAMI, Fla., Jan. 27 (UP).—'The
21,833-ton British liner Empress of
Australia, in which King George
and Queen Elizabeth sailed to Can
ada for a visit to the United States
in 1939, has been torpedoed and ap
parently is sinking 200 miles off
Dakar on the west coast of Africa,
tropical radio reported tonight.
It is assumed that, like other
famous luxury liners of the British
merchant fleet, the Empress of Aus
tralia has been engaged in war
duty—either as an armed auxiliary
or as a transport for troops.
Tropical Radio said it received the
following message directed to its
station here:
"S OS. Torpedoed. Down by the
bow. All boats over the side. Posi
tion about 200 miles off Dakar.
Decks awash."
The message was timed 1:043 p.m.
(EST).
Ten minutes later a second mes
sage said:
"Being shelled again."
Two minutes later the radio sta
tion here reported, only "a few un
intelligible dots and dashes" could
be heard from the ship.
