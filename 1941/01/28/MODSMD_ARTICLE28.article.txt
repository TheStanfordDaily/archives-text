Insulation by compressed air.
That's the latest contribution of Stanford's electrical engineering re
search department. Dr. li. 11. Skilling, acting head of the department, has
l<ir some time been interested in this research which will provide an e.'Ti
< ient and cheaper means of insulation.

Last week at the American
tute of Electrical Engineering in
Philadelphia, William C. Branner, >
Stanford graduate student, who aid- j
ed Dr. Skilling, presented a paper j
on the subject. '
The paper dealt with the electrical ;
"strength" of compressed air—that J
is ,the determination of the voltage '
needed to produce electrical spark- I
ing in a closed chamber containing !
air under compression.
AIII MORE EFFICIENT
Dr. Skilling discovered that air
under compression acts as a more
efficient insulator to prevent spark
ing in electrical apparatus such as
X-ray transformers, electric cables,
and heavy-duty switches.
The most common type of insula
tion now in use is the "oil balh," in
which the equipment is submerged
in especially refined oil. Cables are
usually wrapped in oil-impregnated
paper to prevent sparks from leap
ing to their metal sheathing, accord
ing to Dr. Skilling.
A more recent system used in such |
instruments as switches involves the
blowing of air between the two
poles whenever a circuit is broken.
STRENGTH INCREASED
Dr. Skilling discovered that the
strength of air under pressure is ten
times as high as non-compressed
air ,and that if electrical equipment
is enclosed within a chamber filled
with compressed air, it is effectively
insulated against sparking.
Air has been used as an insulator j
more and more in recent years, Dr.
Skilling said, and the research helps
to answer a question among elec
trical engineers as to its potential
effectiveness for this purpose.
The findings of Dr. Skilling and 1
his assistant will also have import
ant bearing on compression in au
tomobile and airplane engine cylin
ders. They will be of particular in
terest to designers of sparkplugs
used in modern high-compression
engines.

Stanford graduate student, who aid- j
ed Dr. Skilling, presented a paper j
on the subject. '
The paper dealt with the electrical ;
"strength" of compressed air—that J
is ,the determination of the voltage '
needed to produce electrical spark- I
ing in a closed chamber containing !
air under compression.
AIII MORE EFFICIENT
Dr. Skilling discovered that air
under compression acts as a more
efficient insulator to prevent spark
ing in electrical apparatus such as
X-ray transformers, electric cables,
and heavy-duty switches.
The most common type of insula
tion now in use is the "oil balh," in
which the equipment is submerged
in especially refined oil. Cables are
usually wrapped in oil-impregnated
paper to prevent sparks from leap
ing to their metal sheathing, accord
ing to Dr. Skilling.
A more recent system used in such |
instruments as switches involves the
blowing of air between the two
poles whenever a circuit is broken.
STRENGTH INCREASED
Dr. Skilling discovered that the
strength of air under pressure is ten
times as high as non-compressed
air ,and that if electrical equipment
is enclosed within a chamber filled
with compressed air, it is effectively
insulated against sparking.
Air has been used as an insulator j
more and more in recent years, Dr.
Skilling said, and the research helps
to answer a question among elec
trical engineers as to its potential
effectiveness for this purpose.
The findings of Dr. Skilling and 1
his assistant will also have import
ant bearing on compression in au
tomobile and airplane engine cylin
ders. They will be of particular in
terest to designers of sparkplugs
used in modern high-compression
engines.
Insulation by compressed air.
That's the latest contribution of Stanford's electrical engineering re
search department. Dr. li. 11. Skilling, acting head of the department, has
l<ir some time been interested in this research which will provide an e.'Ti
< ient and cheaper means of insulation.
