# Cards Take Broncs, 44-41
## Passaglia, Davidson Tie For Honors 
### DON SELBY 
Playing «ine of their best hall
games of the season, Stanford's cag
ers put down a last-half Bronco
tally to wallop Santa Clara in the
Pavilion last night, 44-41.
With Don Burness pumping
through two field goals before the
Broncs were warmed up, the In
dians went into an early lead which
they held throughout the game. The
first half was all Stanford, as the
Indians lengthened their lead to 10
points twice during that period. But
the Broncs came with a rush in the
second canto, with Marty Passaglia,
hot-shot Bronc forward, hitting the
hoop for seven field goals which,
along with his first-half free throw,
gave him a tie with the Indians'
Kenny Davidson for high-point
honors with 15 counters.
Davidson was the Indians' big
gun tonight just as Burness was
against Cal last Friday night. His
faking and all around ball handling
was more than Coach George Barsi's
lads could cope with.
INDIANS LEAD AT HALF
A pair of ten-footers by Davidson
and a one-handed shot by Don Wil
liams just before the end of the first
half sent the Indians into a ten
point lead at 26-16 as the teams left
the court at the intermission. But
starting the second period, Santa
Clara, playing a much faster ball
game, cut the lead down to 6 points
as Bob Feerick and Passaglia started
pouring the ball through the hoop
from anywhere from 10 to 20 feet
out.
But despite the offensive talents
of Feerick and Passaglia the Broncs
failed to head the flying Stanfords at
any time in the second half, the
smallest margin in the score before
the last two minutes being 5 points
when Passaglia tallied on a set-up
and again on a 30-foot set shot and
Feerick added 2 more points on a
set shot to bring the score to 35-30.
BRONCS THREATEN
But at that point Bill Cowden's
field goal and free throw, a pair of
left-handers by Burness, and a field
goal by Bob Wensel went the Indian
point total soaring. With three min
utes left in the ball game, Bruce
Hale, who was held to two field
goals by ihe guarding of Cowden,
tanked a IP-footer from the side to
bring the Broncs within threatening
distance, but Loo Murphy's field
goal with two minutes to go ended
the Santa Clara scoring as the In
dians went into their effective stall
game.

pouring the ball through the hoop
from anywhere from 10 to 20 feet

But despite the offensive talents
of Feerick and Passaglia the Broncs
failed to head the flying Stanfords at
any time in the second half, the
smallest margin in the score before
the last two minutes being 5 points
when Passaglia tallied on a set-up
and again on a 30-foot set shot and
Feerick added 2 more points on a
set shot to bring the score to 35-30.
BRONCS THREATEN
But at that point Bill Cowden's
field goal and free throw, a pair of
left-handers by Burness, and a field
goal by Bob Wensel went the Indian
point total soaring. With three min
utes left in the ball game, Bruce
Hale, who was held to two field
goals by ihe guarding of Cowden,
tanked a IP-footer from the side to
bring the Broncs within threatening
distance, but Loo Murphy's field

the Santa Clara scoring as the In

Playing «ine of their best hall
games of the season, Stanford's cag
ers put down a last-half Bronco
tally to wallop Santa Clara in the
Pavilion last night, 44-41.
With Don Burness pumping
through two field goals before the
Broncs were warmed up, the In
dians went into an early lead which
they held throughout the game. The
first half was all Stanford, as the
Indians lengthened their lead to 10
points twice during that period. But
the Broncs came with a rush in the
second canto, with Marty Passaglia,
hot-shot Bronc forward, hitting the
hoop for seven field goals which,
along with his first-half free throw,
gave him a tie with the Indians'
Kenny Davidson for high-point
honors with 15 counters.
Davidson was the Indians' big
gun tonight just as Burness was
against Cal last Friday night. His
faking and all around ball handling
was more than Coach George Barsi's
lads could cope with.
INDIANS LEAD AT HALF
A pair of ten-footers by Davidson
and a one-handed shot by Don Wil
liams just before the end of the first
half sent the Indians into a ten
point lead at 26-16 as the teams left
the court at the intermission. But
