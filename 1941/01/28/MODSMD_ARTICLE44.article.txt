# Papoose Cagers Eclipse Bronco Yearlings, 32-28
## 
### 
Jim Pollard broke a 28-28 overtime deadlock with two sensational
'buckets in the closing seconds to give Stanford's frosli cagers a 32-28
victory over (he Santa Clara yearlings in last night's preliminary in the
Pavilion,
Bi'onco forward Sam Patrick must have had a bad dream before

waking up this morning. With
chance to win the struggle on two I
free throws — being fouled by Eob j
Wreisner as the gun went off the !
first time — he missed them both,
and the crowd screamed its lungs
out as the game went into over
time.
Nary a foul was called in the
overture both squads scoring once
apiece while the clock ran around to
30 seconds before the gun, at which
point Pollard sank the winning and :
clinching tallies.
POLLARD HIGH SCORER
By virtue of the two, the rangy
frosh forward took high-scoring
honors for the evening with 12
points, and unlucky Mr. Patrick
followed with 9. Dick Middleton,
Dick West, and Sam Aliamo each
had eight.
In the first half, over-zealous
guarding produced 13 fouls, ten of
them called on Stanford. Middle
ton and Dick McDonough were
ejected on four personals, Frank
McCann and Dick West taking over
and finishing.
COLTS TAKE LEAD
Employing a" bullet-like break,
the Colts burned up the floor in
the first half, leaving the floor with
a 14-13 advantage.
The Card babes came back
strongly and matched their oppo
nents with bucket for bucket, and at
one time were ahead, 21-15. Santa
Clara bounced right back with even
Claar bounced right back with even
more speed, making good two shots j
to every one for the Red five, finallv

tying the score at 26-26. Pollard
took care of the overtime period.
