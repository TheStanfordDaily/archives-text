# An Active Democracy
## 
### 
TO those who noticed The Daily's cross-sec
tional sampling of Stanford opinion last
week, it was apparent that the undergraduate
had moved a long way down the road to war
in the past year.
In January, 1940, after Russia had broken into
Finland at last, the Baltic was still partially sur
rounded by free states, France was crouching
behind the Maginot, and the icy grip of winter
held the Continent in its cold, blue vise, the
United States felt relatively confident that it
would not enter the conflict. Today about 70
per cent of those people you pass on the Quad
think the United States will be a participant —
sometime, maybe soon.
Just about that same percentage of Stanford
men and women heartily favor the Lend-Lease
Bill. They want all-out aid to Britain. And al
most all of them are sincere in wishing the
overthrow of Hitlerism and the triumph of
democracy. Some of them wish to fight that
battle, actively, at once.
The greatest issue which has entered the pic
ture in the past few months is perhaps unsolv
able. Is it possible to resist the totalitarian on
slaught without becoming totalitarian? Can
America fight two wars—the war to defeat Hit
ler abroad, by means of economic assistance to
England; and the war to preserve the spirit and
active structure of democracy at home? With
out one, the other is useless.
Today our position is extremely practical.
England is furthering one of those battles. If
we can assist England with materials of war,
and not with men, we can save America from
ihe fate of another "lost generation." Ours is a
struggle against time—to give democracy an
other chance after it muffed the last one in 1918.
And while we help England fight one battle, it
is essential that America, at home, in the fac
tory and the field, the classroom and the court,
fight the other battle—to prove that democracy
can work in time of crisis as in time of peace.
Unlike the popular axiom to the contrary, war
does settle something. It decides who shall gov
ern, what ideology shall be imposed, in the
immediate future. Viewing the world scene can
didly, America, innately, must wish that de
mocracy will be the ruling ideology. And
America must contribute, as best she can, to the
success of the battle to preserve that form of
government. That choice is made.

Unlike the popular axiom to the contrary, war
does settle something. It decides who shall gov
ern, what ideology shall be imposed, in the
immediate future. Viewing the world scene can
didly, America, innately, must wish that de
mocracy will be the ruling ideology. And
America must contribute, as best she can, to the
success of the battle to preserve that form of
government. That choice is made.
TO those who noticed The Daily's cross-sec
tional sampling of Stanford opinion last
week, it was apparent that the undergraduate
had moved a long way down the road to war
in the past year.
In January, 1940, after Russia had broken into
Finland at last, the Baltic was still partially sur
rounded by free states, France was crouching
behind the Maginot, and the icy grip of winter
held the Continent in its cold, blue vise, the
United States felt relatively confident that it
would not enter the conflict. Today about 70
per cent of those people you pass on the Quad
think the United States will be a participant —
sometime, maybe soon.
Just about that same percentage of Stanford
men and women heartily favor the Lend-Lease
Bill. They want all-out aid to Britain. And al
most all of them are sincere in wishing the
overthrow of Hitlerism and the triumph of
democracy. Some of them wish to fight that
battle, actively, at once.
The greatest issue which has entered the pic
ture in the past few months is perhaps unsolv
able. Is it possible to resist the totalitarian on
slaught without becoming totalitarian? Can
America fight two wars—the war to defeat Hit
ler abroad, by means of economic assistance to
England; and the war to preserve the spirit and
active structure of democracy at home? With
out one, the other is useless.
Today our position is extremely practical.
England is furthering one of those battles. If
we can assist England with materials of war,
and not with men, we can save America from
ihe fate of another "lost generation." Ours is a
struggle against time—to give democracy an
other chance after it muffed the last one in 1918.
And while we help England fight one battle, it
is essential that America, at home, in the fac
tory and the field, the classroom and the court,
fight the other battle—to prove that democracy
can work in time of crisis as in time of peace.
