# Minority Dilemma
## 
### 
THREATENING to disrupt the entire emotional
balance of the campus is a situation that
arose during the recent rains and is fraught
with social significance.
The complaint has often been leveled that the
ratio of men to women at Stanford is such that
only a small percentage of the Farm's male
population is able to enjoy the normal com
patible relationship that should exist between
man and won^n.
But during the downpour of the past few days,
the position of those few Stanford men who
have been fortunate enough to insure their
normal pursuits in the field of social relation
ships has been threatened seriously.
This is a circumstance that proper authorities
should take steps immediately to remedy. It
is serious enough when only a few Stanford
men have the opportunity to enjoy a normal
"friendship" with women. It is downright dan
gerous when the position of these few happy
mortals is jeopardized.
But that is exactly what has happened. Ac
cording to all confidential reports that The Daily
has received, the Cactus Gardens have become
a mire impossible of penetration by automobile.
* Also, the grapevine has it that Gordy's little red
headlight has been working overtime on the
golf course and other such rendezvous.
The Daily, in line with its policy of attempting
to ameliorate all unsound conditions on the cam
pus, offers the following suggestions to restore
normality to this particular problem:
1. For a slight fee to allay depreciation costs,
the B.A.C. could loan out its portable barriers
that it uses to detour traffic on football days.
The user could then find some reasonably quiet

road, encircle his car with these barriers, and
hang out a detour sign to turn traffic elsewhere.
2. The campus could be re-zoned at night to
make some of the asphalt roads available to
the young people. For instance, Palm Drive
could be closed off at one end and the students
could park there safely and with complete as
surance.
3. A special ordinance could be enacted by
Excom specifying that lower headlights should
be installed on all cars.
In our opinion, one concrete result will accrue
from an intelligent application of any of the
above three suggestions, namely, a long stride
will be taken toward realization of Dr. Wilbur's
oft-repeated dream of keeping Stanfordites on
campus.â€”G. M.
