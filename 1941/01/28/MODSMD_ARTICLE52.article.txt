THE Daily staff convenes today at 1:15 o'clock
to talk over life in general and newspaper
work only incidentally. Editor Hutchinson will
give forth on his philosophy of life, cleverly
tying in his discussion with the importance of
photography in everyday living. To illustrate
his point, the Quad will take the Daily staff
picture after the meeting. Editorial Board will
meet at 1 o'clock to cut paper doilies.
