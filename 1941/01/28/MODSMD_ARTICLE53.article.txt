### BUD AMES 
. . . EVER SEE A SANDWICH WALKING?
N°- NO, not that. Anything but that.
Sorry, but it just has to be that way. Yes, here
we go back into the Cellar again. Every week, you
must read at least one scalding message of light deal
ing with center of Farm life—the Cellar. Most of them
don t mean much. But here today, hotter than a
Mexican blue-plate lunch, is something which stops
the show.
It happened a couple of days ago, when the fair
hairy heroine of this little drama minced into the Cel
lar for a bracer in the form of a strong, healthy
cheese sandwich—on whole-wheat with lots of mayon
naise. It was a strong sandwich all right. It turned
out that it was strong enough to walk.
* * * *
W/T3LL ,to get on with it, the sandwich arrived with
one of the hashers in tow and deposited itself
on the scarred counter. The heroine lifted the bread
—whole-wheat—and there were the little triangles of
cheese, looking no bigger than diapers for a midget's
premature baby.
Cheese. But where was the mayonnaise? Some
body had forgotten to spread on the mayonnaise. So
the heroine jumped up and down a few times, and
finally somebody brought up a pot of mayonnaise.
As our heroine started spreading it over the sand
wich, she was bothered by a little black speck lying
on the bread. No, it was not one of those specks you
used to find in the bottom of your cokes. Guess again.
Well, anyway, she carefully picked out the speck
and placed it to the side of the plate, right next to
those two slices of dill pickle. It is dill, isn't it? And
then she went on sloshing the mayonnaise.
Then she happened to glance back at the plate.
Where was the speck. It had gone. Had it blown
away? No, there it was. There it was.
Crawling.
It wasn't a speck at all. It turned out to be a
somewhat chagrinned slug, about as big as a pencil
eraser—you know the kind of slug you find in any
cabbage patch, if you've got a cabbage patch.
* * * *
J-JOW it had gotten there nobody knows. But that
isn't important. The point is that it was STILL
there. Olives, and a little scrap of lettuce, and two
slices of dill pickle, you can stand with your cheese
sandwiches. But not a chagrinned slug.
Now truthfully and rightly you can mumble
grumble that crusades against the Cellar are "dead
letter" topics. The Cellar is always taking a drubbing
about something—the service, the hashers, the dime
tomato juices. But performing cheese is going a little
too far.
A slug in the sandwich speaks of something. You
draw your own conclusions.
And with regard to the last Cellar campaign—the
one against specks in the bottom of the cokes—well,
it is a pleasure to inform you here, that the few
poignant, printed words seem to have done the trick.
The specks are gone.
What were they? A microscopic study of a couple
of the specks showed that they were a lacquer mate
rial—the kind that is found lining coke dispensers. So
you see, comment did do some material good.
And now, here's to happier, healthier sandwiches
that aren't hungry themselves. Just so long as they
cant' walk, it's okay.

Then she happened to glance back at the plate.
Where was the speck. It had gone. Had it blown
away? No, there it was. There it was.
Crawling.
It wasn't a speck at all. It turned out to be a
somewhat chagrinned slug, about as big as a pencil
eraser—you know the kind of slug you find in any
cabbage patch, if you've got a cabbage patch.
* * * *
J-JOW it had gotten there nobody knows. But that
isn't important. The point is that it was STILL
there. Olives, and a little scrap of lettuce, and two
slices of dill pickle, you can stand with your cheese
sandwiches. But not a chagrinned slug.
Now truthfully and rightly you can mumble
grumble that crusades against the Cellar are "dead
letter" topics. The Cellar is always taking a drubbing
about something—the service, the hashers, the dime
tomato juices. But performing cheese is going a little
too far.
A slug in the sandwich speaks of something. You
draw your own conclusions.
And with regard to the last Cellar campaign—the
one against specks in the bottom of the cokes—well,
it is a pleasure to inform you here, that the few
poignant, printed words seem to have done the trick.
The specks are gone.
What were they? A microscopic study of a couple
of the specks showed that they were a lacquer mate
rial—the kind that is found lining coke dispensers. So
you see, comment did do some material good.
And now, here's to happier, healthier sandwiches
that aren't hungry themselves. Just so long as they
cant' walk, it's okay.
. . . EVER SEE A SANDWICH WALKING?
N°- NO, not that. Anything but that.
Sorry, but it just has to be that way. Yes, here
we go back into the Cellar again. Every week, you
must read at least one scalding message of light deal
ing with center of Farm life—the Cellar. Most of them
don t mean much. But here today, hotter than a
Mexican blue-plate lunch, is something which stops
the show.
It happened a couple of days ago, when the fair
hairy heroine of this little drama minced into the Cel
lar for a bracer in the form of a strong, healthy
cheese sandwich—on whole-wheat with lots of mayon
naise. It was a strong sandwich all right. It turned
out that it was strong enough to walk.
* * * *
W/T3LL ,to get on with it, the sandwich arrived with
one of the hashers in tow and deposited itself
on the scarred counter. The heroine lifted the bread
—whole-wheat—and there were the little triangles of
cheese, looking no bigger than diapers for a midget's
premature baby.
Cheese. But where was the mayonnaise? Some
body had forgotten to spread on the mayonnaise. So
the heroine jumped up and down a few times, and
finally somebody brought up a pot of mayonnaise.
As our heroine started spreading it over the sand
wich, she was bothered by a little black speck lying
on the bread. No, it was not one of those specks you
used to find in the bottom of your cokes. Guess again.
Well, anyway, she carefully picked out the speck
and placed it to the side of the plate, right next to
those two slices of dill pickle. It is dill, isn't it? And
then she went on sloshing the mayonnaise.
