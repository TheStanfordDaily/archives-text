# CAMPUS OPINION
## LONE EAGLE AGAIN 
### 
r jpHE EDITOR, SIR:
Last Friday I was quite perturbed over Mr.
Low's column and his "Hearst-like" remarks about
Colonel Lindbergh. Had it not been for two papers
and two hundred pages to read, I would have run to
pen and paper immediately. But now, one Greg has to
add to my wrath with some horribly misguided re
marks in defense of Mr. Low.
May I remind Mr. Low and Greg, that Colonel
Lindbergh was INVITED to speak at last week's
meeting, that he was invited because his knowledge
of world aviation is superior to anyone else's, and
that his opinion is considered by a great many people
in Washington to be well worth hearing. Colonel Lind
bergh has traveled a great deal, and has talked with
many important European men, far more than most
of our government leaders. Consequently, he has had
a good chance to form a well grounded opinion of
world affairs.
Furthermore, what Colonel Lindbergh said was in
answer to questions asked him. Various Congres
sional leaders desired his opinion on subjects seem
ingly remote from aviation, and Colonel Lindbergh
was gracious enough to give answers and had cour
age enough to say what he honestly thought.
And by the blue blazes, I'd like to know what right
Mr. Low and the rest of the American newspapermen
(who hate Lindbergh), have in coming out with sharp
criticism of Lindbergh personally and his right to
voice an opinion. Criticize what he says, but why his
right to say it? If Lindbergh is not qualified to speak,
who is? And when he has been asked a question
and has answered it, a newspaper insists on retorting
with, "Who is Lindbergh, anyway?"
Then I am inclined to agree with DNB, "what
kind of a country is this?"
And, Greg, what makes you think Mr. Harrington
is an isolationist? In fact, I don't believe Mr. Har
rington expressed an opinion on anything except a few
careless remarks made by Mr. Low.
