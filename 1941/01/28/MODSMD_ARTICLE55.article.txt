# Arthur in Woolen Nightie Is Low Point in 'Arizona'
## 
### 
"ARIZONA," starring Jean Arthur and William Ilolden, now playing at
the Stanford Theater.
This week "Arizona" joins the steady run of westerns and near-west
erns that the Hollywood studios have been specializing in lately. But this
latest attempt falls short of the usual standard. It has the hero, the fair

maiden, the gunplay, the hoary,
sheriff, and two villains for good
measure but when all are combined
the result is a lengthy film with
good points few and far between.
Columbia studios took a brief re
spite from the extravaganza type
and had only one medium-sized
herd of cattle, one wagon train at
tacked by Indians, and one sprawl
ing shack-town with extra-filled
streets.
JUST TOO LONG
This fact itself was a decided re
lief and would have been chalked
up in favor of the movie if it hadn't
been drawn to such lengths. That
constitutes the main fault; "Ari
zona" was too long.
Jean "well-I'll-be-dogged" Ar
thur shows amazing versatility in
the part of the lone white woman
in the struggling town of Tucson in
the days before Arizona became a
state. She slaps her jean-covered
knee and slings guns with the best
of them. In fact, she puts over the
masculine idea with such force that
her hero, William Holden, appears
to be tied to her apron string.
TWO VILLAINS
A fine job of crafty villainizing is
done by Warren William and Porter
Hall. Together they harass Miss Ar
thur until Mr William as "chief
threat" stabs his partner in the back
and meets an untimely "two-gun"
end at the hands of Mr. Holden.
All in all, "Arzona' should go in
the class two-and-a-half-bell pic
tures. Its ranking might have been
higher had it not been for a tender
moonlit scene in which Jean Ar
thur in a woolen nightie is sere
naded through the window by Wil
liam Holden to the tune of "Jeanie
With the Light Brown Hair." To
anyone who turns a radio on these
days, that in itself is no recom
mendation.â€”Deane
