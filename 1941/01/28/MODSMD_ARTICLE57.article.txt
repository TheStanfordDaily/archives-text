# Debaters to Meet St. Mary's Squad
## 
### 
Thursday evening two Stanford
debaters will travel to Moraga,
where they will clash with a St.
Mary's team on the question, "Re
solved: That propaganda is leading
the United States toward war."
Stanford will take the negative side
of the question in the non-decision
debate.
