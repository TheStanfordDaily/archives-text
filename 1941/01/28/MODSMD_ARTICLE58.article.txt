# Encinamen Sell Shipwreck Bids
## Survivors to Dance On 'Tropical Island' 
### 
With frantic freshman committee
men frenziedly making final prepa
rations for their first big dance, the
sale of bids to Encina Hall's open
ing social event of the year, Friday
night's Shipwreck Dance, began
comparatively quietly yesterday.
Designed by Eric Hauser, the
tickets are in the form of a folder
and carry out the tropical theme of
the dance. Prices are "50 clam
shells" to Encinamen and one dollar
to outsiders. In this program and in
the propaganda promulgated by
Bill Steif's publicity committee,
guests are asked to wear what "they
wore when the ship went down."
TEMPORARY TROPICS
A real boat will be the center of
attention inside the Encina lobby,
which will be decked out to repre
sent a tropical island. Decoration
committee members under the di
rection of Ted Eberle are now
working out the problem of getting
the boat into the lobby, where the
dance will be held.
Under temporarily swaying palms
beneath a temporary starry blue sky,
survivors of the wreck of the S.S.
Encina will dance to the music of
Captain Carvel Craig and his or
chestra, according to Eberle .
