# Chivalry May Yield To Public Safety
## 
### 
DENVER, Jan. 27 (UP).â€”Chivalry
may be sacrifices to public safety in
Denver and the practice of the man
getting from the car and opening
the door for his lady fair become as
dead as the dodo bird.
This retreat in manners was pro
posed today by Police Chief August
Hanebuth, who said he would ask
the city council to pass an ordinance
making it unlawful for a driver to
enter or alight from his car on the
street side.
Quentin C. Allyn of Sanger is the
new president of the Fresno County
Junior Farm Bureau.
