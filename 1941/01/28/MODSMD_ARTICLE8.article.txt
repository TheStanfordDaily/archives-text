# Excom to Meet For Discussion Of Honor Code
## Wilbur Invites Group To Consider Faculty Member's Protest 
### 
Invitations to paxiicipate in an
honor code discussion at the home
of Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur will be
extended to Ex Committee members
by Bruce Jessup tonight when Ex
com holds its regular weekly meet
ing.
The proposed honor code discus
sion was prompted by a recent let
ter written by a faculty member
who expressed some doubt as to the
justification under the honor code
for students taking examinations
away from the room in which they
are being given. Dr. Wilbur is
seeking student reaction to the in
cident and it is expected that mem
bers of both councils will also be
present.
Bruce Jessup and Dick Stepp will
report to Committee on #ie business
transacted at a recent Union Board
of Governors meeting. Also under
consideration will be the adoption of
a new method of choosing the Con
cert Series manager, who in the past
has simply been appointed by the
outgoing manager and approved by
Ex Committee.
The possibility of affiliating
Speakers Bureau with the Division
of Speech and Drama will be con
sidered also. The bureau has lately
seemed to be outgrowing its capacity
as a student organization operating
on a student budget, according to
Jessup.
