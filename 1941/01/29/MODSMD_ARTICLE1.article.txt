AME-CALLING is but one de
vice used by effective propa
gandists.
That is the opinion of the Insti
tute for Propaganda Analysis, a
non-profit, non-partisan organiza
tion, whose board of advisers in
cludes Grayson N. Kefauver, dean
of Stanford's School of Education.
During the current discussion of
the aid-tft-Britain bill or the, lend
lease bill (both names have been
used), name-calling has played a
prominent part. In fact, Americans
seemingly have learned much from
/the rfropaganda machines of the
totalitarian states.
In many of the countries of Eu
rope, those who disagree with the
existing regime are given labels,
such as "enemy of the state," "Com
munist," "international Jew," or any
of a number of other names. Re
cently, in Nazi-dominated lands, the
term "Communist" has been dis
carded in references to those who
oppose the government. This change
in technique was necessitated by
the German-Soviet alliance.
In this country name-calling has
taken another turn. The state or the
party in power has no monopoly on
its use.
At the present time, one who op
poses the bill before Congress may
be called by his opponents a
"Fascist" or an "appeaser." Neither
is accurate in perhaps close to 100
per cent of the cases.
On the other hand, one who sup
ports the bill may be called by the
opposition a "war-monger" or he
may be told he is "un-American."
In fact, this last term has been used
by both parties to the dispute.
Name-calling is not new in
American politics or history. But it
is interesting to note at this time,
when the technique has been ex
plored so thoroughly by the profes
sional propagandists of Europe, what
part name-calling plays in our own
country.
Because a person objects to the
bill before Congress docs not
mean he is a Fascist or even one
who would sit down to dinner
with an avowed Nazi or Fascist.
And bccausc a person favors
speedy passage of the bill does
not mean that lie favors a declara
tion of war or that he wants to
bury every fourth American son
under the soil of Europe.

significant changes were
offered yesterday for the lend
lease bill before Congress. Demo
cratic leaders of the House agreed
on them and several opposition
spokesmen said they thought these
changes would satisfy many who
have attacked the bill in its pres
ent form. The four changes:
1. Imposition of a two-year limit
on the life of the bill. #
2. Restrictions against the use
of U.S. ships as convoys in Eu
ropean waters.
3. Requirement that the Presi
dent make periodic reports (ev
ery 150 days has been mentioned)
to Congress on all transactions
under the defense program.
4. Provision requiring the Presi
dent to consult with the army
chief of staff and the chief of
naval operations before sending
war materials to other nations un
der the program.
Sol Bloom, chairman of the House
Foreign Affairs Committee, said he
felt these four changes covered "all
objections" to the bill advanced thus
far.

A DEBATE in the Senate commit
tee which is holding hearings on
the bill showed yesterday the widely
differing stands that two veteran
members of the Senate can hold on
the same issue, and neither of the
gentlemen is "un-American."
Senator Hiram Johnson of Cali
fornia said he was opposing the bill
because he wanted to keep us out
of the "bloody war."
Senator Carter Glass of Virginia
said he favored aiding Britain to
the full extent, even if it provoked a
declaration of war on the part of
Germany.
Senator Johnson was quoted as
saying later that Mr. Glass "is the
only person here who wants to de
clare war now."
