Among the glamorous publicity
shots being displayed around the
campus for the forthcoming "St.
Joan" was a picture of Bud Cady
all done up in a semi-medieval
bathrobe. You know Cady — the
"apologetic guy" of last fall's Gaie
ties. Well, last Friday Cady's pic
ture was stolen.
"Tch, tch," said the theater crowd,
"such vandalism," and forgot about
it. But today the picture turned up
in Cady's mail box clipped to the
following note:
"Dear Mr. Cady: We hope you
don't mind our borrowing your
picture for the week-end. It
looked lovely in all the nice
places we used it.
Yours, The Thieves"
Cady is baffled. "I don't under
stand," u says. "Why do such
things ~ /s happen to me?"
"I'm not what they mean by
this letter. Is it a compliment, or
what?"
