# Hawkins Dance Bid Purchases Pass 100 Mark
## Daisy Maes Assume Social Obligations To Their Li'l Abners 
### 
With 'iien all over the campus
self-consi'onslv checking on each
other's popularity Farm "Daisy
Maes," ticket sales the Sadie
Hawkins Jig went »*„cr the hundred
mark early yesterday af'.ernoon at
the A.S.S.U. office.
Patterned after A1 Capp's now
famous comic strip "Li'l Abner" the
Farm version of a Sadie Hawkins
dance will be held on Friday night,
Feb. 7, in the Women's Gym from
9:30 to 1 o'clock. It will be the sec
ond official time Farm women have
assumed the social initiative.
According to Pat Adams, chair
man, costumes should be as "rug
ged" as possible. Jeans and loud
shirts for men, raggedly short and
equally loud ginghams for women
will be in order. Art McCue and
his band will also be appropriately
garbed.
BOOMING SALES
With booming ticket sales rapidly
eating away the total 500 bids avail
able, Chairman Adams was defi
nite in stating that they won't last
long. "Late-comers are liable to find
themselves all dressed up with no
place to go," she commented.
The whole Hawkins legend receiv
ed its impetus from an episode in
Capp's strip wherein Sadie's pop, a
scion of the Ozarks, gets worried
about his daughter's courtin' which
had been lagging—the prospective
bride having reached 35 without an
offer. So, he simply gives all the
town's eligibles a head start on
Sadie; the one who's caught is auto
matically her bridegroom.
THE IDEA SPREADS
From this simple plot, colleges all
over the country snapped up the idea
of a Sadie Hawkins dance. Last year
the success of these dances, held at
over 200 universities throughout the
country, created what amounts to a
tradition.
Stanford's version last year shared
this phenomenal success, with the
result that one week ago two cam
pus organizations were quibbling
over the privilege of giving the
dance.
HAIR FOR SALE
In the interests of furthering the
Daisy Mae illusion, Pat Adams re
ports that blonde tresses are rea
sonably available from the counters
of the local five-and-dimery.
