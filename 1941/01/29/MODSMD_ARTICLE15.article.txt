## Hopkins Discusses Deal in England; On Other Fronts: Fascists Hold Anti-U.S. Meeting; Hitler to Speak

LONDON, Jan. 28 (UP). â€”Great Britain and the United States arc nego
tiating a far-reaching proposal for joint economic warfare against the
Italo-German Axis in an effort to double the effectiveness of Britain's
blockade, it was disclosed Tuesday by economic experts.
Under the plan being discussed in and in Washington, all Ger-

>man assets in the United States
would be "frozen" by order of Presi
dent Roosevelt, and ships trading
with the Axis would be denied entry
to U. S. ports throughout the woiid.
SUPPLIES TO RUSSIA
Because of the shipment of United
States cotton, copper, brass, wheat,
and oil drilling machinery to
Vladivostok and other Soviet ports,
Dalton said, the Russians are able
to release domestic supplies to
Germany.
The scheme covers "virtually ev
ery phase of economic warfare," it
was stated.
President Roosevelt's personal
envoy, Harry L. Hopkins, has been
in discussion with leaders of the
British Avar cabinet on the pro
posals which also are one of the
principal topics of the Washington
talks of Viscount Halifax, New
British ambassador, it was said.
The foundation of the plan, as out
lined by authoritative economists
here, rests with the United States,'
right as a free nation to deny finan
cial and commercial facilities which
benefit interests "acting contrary to
the democratic system."
