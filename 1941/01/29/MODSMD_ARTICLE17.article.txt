# Audience Hails Chinese Film As Laugh Hit
## 
### 
A good looking general, an ambi
tious government official, his plans
to save his country, and a beautiful
girl—it sounds familiar to American
moviegoers, yet last night it was en
acted in Chinese for the Tuesday
Evening Series. "Sable Cicada," a
Chinese movie produced in Shang
hai, aroused laughs and admiration
from a large audience.
Violet Koo, China's outstanding
cinema artist, played the role of
the versatile heroine. First she
played the shy, hard-to-get type for
the handsome general, then she
quickly changed to a coquettish
young thing of 16 and back to the
demure role again in a typically
American way.
The story, which is a Chinese
classic familiar to all children in
that country, dealt with the fall of
the Han dynasty in the latter part of
the third century A.D. Beautiful
native music in the background
helped the audience into the proper
frame of mind. English subtitles
aided comprehension when the
Chinese dialect got out of hand.
The story moved rather slowly at
times, but interest centered on the
facial expressions of the characters
and the native dances. The costum
ing and photography were excellent,
featuring pageant scenes that could
be compared with Cecil B. DeMille's
best.
