# Excom Places Speakers Bureau Under Authority Of Department of Speech
## Anderson Offers Plan for Revision Of Athletic Award Bases; Method Of Choosing Concert Head Changed 
### ROSEMARIE MULLANY 
Voting unanimously to turn Speakers Bureau over to the Division of
Speech and Drama, Ex Committee last night relinquished its complete
authority over this precocious part of the student government.
This action of Ex Committee's terminates a year-long discussion be
tween the bureau and the student manager over allotment of funds. The

activities of the bureau have in the
last few years branched out exten
sively and last year's head of the
bureau, Hugh O'Donnell, was at
great pains to secure more than the
$50 appropriation then given by
the A.S.S.U.
It was finally raised slightly, but
not enough to cover a secretary's
salary. The manager, forced to do
all his own correspondence, which
mounted rapidly, found himself un
'able to carry the burden of admin-
itive plus clerical work.
EXECUTIVE BOARD
Ur der present plans, the bureau
will t inction under the direction of
an executive board made up of the
head of the division, the faculty ad
viser of the bureau, and one, pos
sibly two, students.
Other business of the committee
follows:
ATHLETIC AWARD REVISION:
Sweeping revisions of the system of
athletic awards were enacted pro
visionally by Ex Committee. These
changes affect all but a few sports
and will be fully dealt with in an
early edition of The Daily.
CONCERT SERIES MANAGER:
Amending a former action where
by they decreed that the Series
manager should he chosen by a
committee composed of the stu
dent body president, student man
ager and incumbent manager, Ex
com members last night voted to
eliminate the student body presi
dent from the committee. It was
felt that in the case of any dis
pute, this division of votes would
be the fairest to all concerned.
WORLD AFFAIRS DAY: Bob
Einstein reported that he is now
dickering with Royce Brier and
John B. Hughes, San Francisco
newspapermen, hoping to secure
them as speakers at a Wo/ld Affairs
Day forum.
CARD FILES SWELLED: No en
terprise on which committee mem
bers have embarked this year has
prompted the excitement which last
night attended the sign-up of the

Voting unanimously to turn Speakers Bureau over to the Division of
Speech and Drama, Ex Committee last night relinquished its complete
authority over this precocious part of the student government.
This action of Ex Committee's terminates a year-long discussion be
tween the bureau and the student manager over allotment of funds. The

activities of the bureau have in the
last few years branched out exten
sively and last year's head of the
bureau, Hugh O'Donnell, was at
great pains to secure more than the
$50 appropriation then given by
the A.S.S.U.
It was finally raised slightly, but
not enough to cover a secretary's
salary. The manager, forced to do
all his own correspondence, which
mounted rapidly, found himself un
'able to carry the burden of admin-
itive plus clerical work.
EXECUTIVE BOARD
Ur der present plans, the bureau
will t inction under the direction of
an executive board made up of the
head of the division, the faculty ad
viser of the bureau, and one, pos
sibly two, students.
Other business of the committee
follows:
ATHLETIC AWARD REVISION:
Sweeping revisions of the system of
athletic awards were enacted pro
visionally by Ex Committee. These
changes affect all but a few sports
and will be fully dealt with in an
early edition of The Daily.
CONCERT SERIES MANAGER:
Amending a former action where
by they decreed that the Series
manager should he chosen by a
committee composed of the stu
dent body president, student man
ager and incumbent manager, Ex
com members last night voted to
eliminate the student body presi
dent from the committee. It was
felt that in the case of any dis
pute, this division of votes would
be the fairest to all concerned.
WORLD AFFAIRS DAY: Bob
Einstein reported that he is now
dickering with Royce Brier and
John B. Hughes, San Francisco
newspapermen, hoping to secure
them as speakers at a Wo/ld Affairs
Day forum.
