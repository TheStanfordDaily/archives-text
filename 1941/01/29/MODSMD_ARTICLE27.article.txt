Shaw which will be presented in the Memorial Theater tomorrow, Friday

To his equals and superiors, Gilles !
de Rais was an honorable gentleman |
of the court who had won many i
honors for his bravery while still
I young, and whose only fault was his
excessive extravagance; but to the
peasants of his Breton barony he was
a monster, and it was through their
evidence that he was finally be
trayed for what he was.
FORTUNES RUINED
When, through his extravagance,
Gilles de Rais ruined his fortunes,
he sought to restore them through
necromancy and sacrifice to Satan.
Children and young boys of the
neighborhood disappeared in great
numbers, until the peasants were
driven to protest.
When finally de Rais aroused the
anger of the church through viola
tion of ecclesiastical rules his
crimes were brought out, and in his
confessions his horrible practices of
torture and murder of children were
revealed to such extent that they
filled pages. Furthermore, his fiend
ish delight in sadistic activities
brought his reputation to ruin.
HANGED AT LAST
Only to escape excommunication
from the church did de Rais con
fess to his many crimes and he was
hanged in 1440. The number of his
I victims is said to have been 140.
With exception of the process of
| Joan of Arc, Bluebeard's was the
