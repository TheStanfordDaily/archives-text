it snuck up on us.
Meaning the baseball season.
While papers elsewhere were trying
to determine whether Bob Feller or
Buck Newsome is the highest paid
pitcher in baseball, and just how
much cash Joe DiMaggio will get
from the Yankees this year, the
horrehide sport made its debut here
on the Farm yesterday with a no
ticeable absence of fanfare and
whoop-ti-do.
The Indians might be a very good
ball club this year. But then, they
looked like a great team last year
until the league season opened,
when they began to have one heck
of a time winning ball games.
This entry has already had some
hard luck. Carl Kcllenbergcr,
hard-hitting outfielder up from the
frosh, ran into scholastic diffi
culties and won't be eligible until
spring quarter. Thor Peterson, vet
eran fly chaser, will also be lost to
the club.
Alex Cereghino is the only out
fielder with a good hold on his job.
"Cherry" is a good bet to hold down
the center field job a good part of
the time.
Bill Ravetto, a transfer, is leading
the pack fighting for Norm Juney's
old spot in left field. Cookie South,
because of his experience, has first
call in right field, but his hold on
the job is pretty shaky.

IYJONTY PFYL and Elton Boone
are back to hold down short and
third,. but the other two positions
are wide open. Ray Hammett, a
sophomore, has worked well at first,
and Aurelio (the guy with the
name) Caruso may be the goods at
second, but they've got a tough bat
tle on their hands.
The catching, a weak point last
year, should improve with the
presence of Ace Hanlon, star
frosh backstop last season. Han
lon has a world of fire, and looks
like a great prospect.
Captain Cootie Thompson will
again be the mainstay of the mound
corps. Coach Harry Wolter expects
him to get more help this year from
such as Claude Purkitt, Phil Wolf,
Russ Smith, and Bill Harms.
Purkitt pitched a couple of fine
games in the latter stages of the '40
season. Wolfe, top frosh hurler last
year, has improved greatly this fall.
This afternoon, weather permit
ting, as we must say at this time of
year, the Cards will take on a club
made up of major and minor leagu
ers. The Kenealy line-up hasn't
been released, but on a basis of the
men they've brought down in past
years, Farm fans will get a look at

some real major league stars in
action.
In the last two years Dario
Lodigiani, Babe Dahlgren, Ernie
Lcmbardi. and others have played
cn the sunken diamond, so if you
want to see some real hail play
ers, hustle out there around 3:15.
* >1* *
tonight, just to keep studies
from becoming monotonous, the
Novice and All-U championships
will be held in the ring in the Pa
vilion.
Johnny Ward meets Vic Lindskog
in the feature event, and there'll be
more good bouts on tap than
have been seen here on one night,
before.
