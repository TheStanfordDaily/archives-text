# Varsity Nine Wins Opener
## Deanmen Prepare For Uclan Bruins 
### 
With three victories in the last
1 five days under their belts, Stan
: ford's high-fiying cagers went to
work yesterday afternoon in prepa
! ration for their invasion of Westwood
this coming week-end when they
, take on the Ucla Bruins in a pair of
j conference battles.
It was an Indian team playing
j nearly its best game of basketball
â–  that defeated Santa Clara, 44-41,
Monday night, and if Coach Everett
Dean's charges can duplicate that
brand of ball against the Bruins,
this week-end should see Ihe Cards
! stretch their P.C.C. lead even fur
ther.
U.C.L.A., on the other hand, ean
! not be rated as too easy a foe, for
i it, must be remembered that the
Bruins once defeated the Cal quin
i tet that gave the Indians such a
I scare last Friday night.

Stanford's varsity bafteballers
opened the season with a 5-2 vic
tory over the Gaddini All-Stars in a
sloppily played game this afternoon.
The tilt was a good warm-up for to
morrow's game with the Kennealy
Seals, who usually sport a good
hunch of major leaguers.
The Indians found they had a
couple of potential stars in Phil
Wolf and Aurelio Caruso, two soph
omore additions. Caruso doubled
twice to drive in one run and score
another. Hurler Wolf took over the
| mound duties in the fourth, fifth,
and sixth, holding the All-Stars
I scoreless.
Cootie Thompson started for Stan
ford and was touched for a couple
I of singles in the first, which led to
a run. Powers, first All-Star to hit,
dropped a Texas Leaguer over sec
| ond base. He scored on Lodigiani's
i fluke single which Cereghino and
j Caruso let fall to the ground as they
held a conference to decide who
should catch it.
Stanford made its first score in
the last of the second
