# Odds Favor Golf Scoring Records

FORT WORTH, Tex., Jan. 28
(UP). â€”It is an even money bet to
day that the National Open golf
scoring record will be broken next
June because the men who will run
the show have decided against
toughening up the Colonial Club
course for the championship.
Ralph Guldahl fired the record
231 for 72 championship holes in
the 1937 open at Birmingham, Mich.,
but anything more than 280 will not
eevn have a look-in at the 1941 title,
and there probably will be a dozen
players in a dog-fight around that
figure on the final day.

Operation of San Francisco's city
and county government costs an
average of 21 cents a day per citizen.
