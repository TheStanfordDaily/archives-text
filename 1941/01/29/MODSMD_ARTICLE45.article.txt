# Ah, Wilderness
## 
### 
ONE of the boys in a midnight bull session
that had switched from women to the
European war, as so many bull sessions are
apt to nowadays, was a bit hesitant about draw
ing any profound conclusion.
"All this talking," he grumbled, "doesn't get
us anywhere. Who gives a damn what we
think?"
Take that and multiply by approximately
13,000,000 and you've got the inner feelings of
the young men and women of this nation. And
it's true, in this age of 1941, where the remnants
of patriarchy are still deeply infused within our
culture.
It's too bad that all these 13,000,000 voices
of ours are crying in the wilderness with no
one to listen. But what's worse is having every
newspaper editor and radio commentator tell
ing us what we think.
More words are put into the mouths of the
"youth of America" every day than would fill
old man Harvard's five-foot shelf. You and I are
endorsing this or protesting that on the editorial
pages of every newspaper or over the air on
each day's broadcast.
They quote us. But no one asks us. And
where it all comes from no one knows.
Some few youth groups, largely in the East
ern states, have attempted to take the burden
of speaking for the "youth of America" upon
their own shoulders. Most of these have turned
into dismal flops. The publicity was hardly the
sort that would make anybody care what you
and I actually do think.
And so you and I are quoted in the papers.
And so any casual reader, and there are millions
of them, has a mental picture of the "youth of
America" as rarin', fightin' fools (if it's an inter
ventionist paper) or as staid milksops (if it's an
isolationist publication).
I don't think you and I want to fight in British
East Africa for some oil company's interests. If
someone brings an army over here then things
are different. Anyone would protect his home
and family.
But what most of the 13,000,000 of us want is
a chance to get started on that job we're hoping
for; and maybe that cottage for two that you
read about. We'll carry a gun should the time
come — but the thought of other generations
doing the same during an ever recurrent 25-
year cycle seems like birth control's strongest
selling point.
Maybe the young Germans, Italians, and Japa
nese want something else. Perhaps prodding
some unfortunate at the point of a bayonet is
their ideal of a perfect twenty-first birthday.
I don't think they feel that way either.—W. C.

doing the same during an ever recurrent 25-
year cycle seems like birth control's strongest
selling point.
Maybe the young Germans, Italians, and Japa
nese want something else. Perhaps prodding

their ideal of a perfect twenty-first birthday.
I don't think they feel that way either.—W. C.
ONE of the boys in a midnight bull session
that had switched from women to the
European war, as so many bull sessions are
apt to nowadays, was a bit hesitant about draw
ing any profound conclusion.
"All this talking," he grumbled, "doesn't get
us anywhere. Who gives a damn what we
think?"
Take that and multiply by approximately
13,000,000 and you've got the inner feelings of
the young men and women of this nation. And
it's true, in this age of 1941, where the remnants
of patriarchy are still deeply infused within our
culture.
It's too bad that all these 13,000,000 voices
of ours are crying in the wilderness with no
one to listen. But what's worse is having every
newspaper editor and radio commentator tell
ing us what we think.
More words are put into the mouths of the
"youth of America" every day than would fill
old man Harvard's five-foot shelf. You and I are
endorsing this or protesting that on the editorial
pages of every newspaper or over the air on
each day's broadcast.
They quote us. But no one asks us. And
where it all comes from no one knows.
Some few youth groups, largely in the East
ern states, have attempted to take the burden
of speaking for the "youth of America" upon
their own shoulders. Most of these have turned
into dismal flops. The publicity was hardly the
sort that would make anybody care what you
and I actually do think.
And so you and I are quoted in the papers.
And so any casual reader, and there are millions
of them, has a mental picture of the "youth of
America" as rarin', fightin' fools (if it's an inter
ventionist paper) or as staid milksops (if it's an
isolationist publication).
I don't think you and I want to fight in British
East Africa for some oil company's interests. If
someone brings an army over here then things
are different. Anyone would protect his home
and family.
But what most of the 13,000,000 of us want is
a chance to get started on that job we're hoping
for; and maybe that cottage for two that you
read about. We'll carry a gun should the time
come — but the thought of other generations
doing the same during an ever recurrent 25-
year cycle seems like birth control's strongest
selling point.
