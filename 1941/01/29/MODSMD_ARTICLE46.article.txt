ALMOST unnoticed by three-fourths of the
campus, The Daily printed a small article
not long ago to the effect that Dr. Wilbur had
announced that the course "Women in the
Home" will be given again in the spring quarter.
The course, contrary to popular belief, is not
given for the benefit of the mythical feminine
two-thirds who come to Stanford to get married,
but rather is directed at equipping senior women
with some knowledge of consumer economy as
well as some of the practical aspects of home
making. Admission to the course is by per
mission only, as the enrollment must corre
spond with the available lab equipment.
Because of the limited enrollment, so many
women were unable to take the course that the
matter was taken to Dr. Wilbur. Seeing the
value of the course and the interest in it, he
allocated funds from the University budget's
emergency funds so that it might be given
again.
The popularity of this course and the Social
Science course, "Personal Problems in Modern
Society," also with limited enrollment, points to
an unmistakable deficiency in Stanford's aca
demic curriculum for women. Undoubtedly
there are women students who forego a Stan
ford education in order to take courses in home
economics and dietetics at universities else
where.
However, the interest in these courses does
not necessarily indicate an interest in home
economics. It does indicate that students want
their college educations supplemented by
courses that will prepare them not only to meet
and cope with the everyday working world,
but for the practical aspects of living.
Stanford offers courses in economics, but
they are given from the producer's standpoint.
Courses presenting consumer economics—simi
lar to "Women in the Home" but more far-reach
ing and inclusive are the ones that students are
evidencing an interest in.
Eventually this demand may lead to the es
tablishment of a Department of Euthenics, simi

lar to the one at Vassar and other Eastern col
leges. At this point the University hampered
by lack of equipment, or instructors, could not
answer a demand of this kind. However, the
fact that "Women in the Home" is being re
peated, that members of the University dining
halls staff are again contributing their time and
information to this project, shows that the Uni
versity is attempting to meet a need—that of
preparing its students to better meet the post
collegiate social environment.—M. E. F.
