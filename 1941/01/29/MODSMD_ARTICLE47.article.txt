# BULL SESSION
## LONG, ICE COLD ONES 
### BUD AMES 
JJERE comes just an extra note left over in the little
black notebook.
It concerns this new skating club which has been
organized by some go-getters on this Farm. Frankly,
it's a swell idea, and something that should have been
done quite some time ago.
About two years ago, very much on the sly, a few
students here questioned several other students re
garding the possibility of creating some sort of an ice
hockey team which would represent Stanford in local
and intercollegiate ice circles.
The students—many of them—liked the idea. Many
of them came from the East or had attended eastern
prep schools. And why, they wondered, couldn't Stan
ford support a hockey team in much the same man
ner as Southern California and several other colleges?
* + * *
the ice enthusiasts sounded out the B.A.C. to
find out just how much administrative force could
be mustered behind this student promotion scheme.
But two years ago was a dark, dark time in the stale
mated B.A.C. The football squad, which in reality
supports the other Stanford sports, had shown little
signs of being a football team, present, past, or
future. * k
Frankly, they said, there just wasn't much hope of
raising money to start a new sport, hockey.
After that, plans began to flatten out rapidly.
Thoughts of a team were soon forgotten. It's funny,
but you know how important money is if you want
to get a new idea under way. No dough—no go.
But the interest in skating lived on. And now it is
beginning to express itself in the growing hoards of
Stanford people who are motoring down to the new
ice rink in San Jose for evenings of ankle-twisting
and chummy cross-armed skating.
* * * *
I\ ow a Stanford skating club has been formed, and
some energetic people have gone out of their col
lective ways to arrange for special ticket books which
get you student into that rink. And if you ax'e a nov
ice, they'll throw in a mess of free instruction which
will cut your falls to less than one a minute.
But even if you don't feel in the club-joining mood,
the rink is a swell place to have a rip-roaring good
time. You are always looking for some place new to
go for a date—and here it is. The toll charge is less
than a quarter if you bring along your student body
card.
If you don't have skates, the total charge for en
trance, skates, and the works is just 58 cents a per
son. And it's a nice place to go on a date. And try
one of their hot dogs with everything on—they're
swell.

hockey team which would represent Stanford in local
and intercollegiate ice circles.
The students—many of them—liked the idea. Many
of them came from the East or had attended eastern
prep schools. And why, they wondered, couldn't Stan
ford support a hockey team in much the same man
ner as Southern California and several other colleges?

the ice enthusiasts sounded out the B.A.C. to
find out just how much administrative force could
be mustered behind this student promotion scheme.
But two years ago was a dark, dark time in the stale
mated B.A.C. The football squad, which in reality
supports the other Stanford sports, had shown little
signs of being a football team, present, past, or
future. * k
Frankly, they said, there just wasn't much hope of
raising money to start a new sport, hockey.
After that, plans began to flatten out rapidly.
Thoughts of a team were soon forgotten. It's funny,
but you know how important money is if you want
to get a new idea under way. No dough—no go.
But the interest in skating lived on. And now it is
beginning to express itself in the growing hoards of
Stanford people who are motoring down to the new
ice rink in San Jose for evenings of ankle-twisting
and chummy cross-armed skating.

I\ ow a Stanford skating club has been formed, and
some energetic people have gone out of their col
lective ways to arrange for special ticket books which
get you student into that rink. And if you ax'e a nov
ice, they'll throw in a mess of free instruction which
will cut your falls to less than one a minute.
But even if you don't feel in the club-joining mood,
the rink is a swell place to have a rip-roaring good
time. You are always looking for some place new to
go for a date—and here it is. The toll charge is less
than a quarter if you bring along your student body
card.
If you don't have skates, the total charge for en
trance, skates, and the works is just 58 cents a per
son. And it's a nice place to go on a date. And try
one of their hot dogs with everything on—they're
swell.
JJERE comes just an extra note left over in the little
black notebook.
It concerns this new skating club which has been
organized by some go-getters on this Farm. Frankly,
it's a swell idea, and something that should have been
done quite some time ago.
About two years ago, very much on the sly, a few
students here questioned several other students re
