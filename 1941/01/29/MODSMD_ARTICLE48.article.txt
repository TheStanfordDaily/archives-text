# CAMPUS OPINION
## LONE EAGLE, AND HOW 
### 
yHE EDITOR, SIR:
At the terrible risk of bringing down upon my
head the biting sarcasm of Stanford's isolationist
Moses, a certain Mr. Harrington, I would like to sug
gest that he examine the facts behind "Black Knight"
Low's discussion of Lindbergh before riding forth to
defend the slightly speckled "honor" of suffering
Colonel Lindbergh.
Mr. Low did not suggest that the Lone (and how!)
Eagle was competent to discuss aeronautics but not
foreign affairs and let the matter go at that. Your
very, very poor analogy involving Mr. Low, his ten
nis, and the United States' foreign policy suggested
that you read the lead of the column in question and
let the matter go at that. Mr. Low specifically cited
statements of Colonel (or is it Herr) Lindbergh which
lead any person who looks at the facts to only one
conclusion.
While anyone will grant that Britain is not in the
present conflict simply for deah, deah democracy but
also for the British pound, one will have to agree that
Britain comes closer to representing democracy than
Germany. One hundred per cent guilt or innocence is
hard to find! At most, one side in the conflict must be
content to emulate Ivory Soap and be only 99 44-100
per cent pure—no side in a situation like this is totally
right.
However, there is the question of degree in situa
tions like this, and the blame for the precipitation of
the present conflict is not so equally divided that it
can be said that a victory by either side would amount
to the same thing.
When dealing with a malignant growth like Fascism,
one can't compromise. It may be compared to a can
cer—either you "get" the cancer or it "gets" you.
Does Lindbergh presume for a moment that democ
racy can live surrounded by Fascism? Only two con
clusions can be drawn from his argument. Either he
wants Fascism or he is misguided in his reasoning to
such an extent that he can't understand that Fascism
doesn't reach maturity physically until it has no more
room in which to expand.
Keep up the good work, Mr. Low.

conclusion.
While anyone will grant that Britain is not in the
present conflict simply for deah, deah democracy but
also for the British pound, one will have to agree that
Britain comes closer to representing democracy than
Germany. One hundred per cent guilt or innocence is
hard to find! At most, one side in the conflict must be
content to emulate Ivory Soap and be only 99 44-100
per cent pure—no side in a situation like this is totally
right.
However, there is the question of degree in situa
tions like this, and the blame for the precipitation of
the present conflict is not so equally divided that it
can be said that a victory by either side would amount
to the same thing.
When dealing with a malignant growth like Fascism,
one can't compromise. It may be compared to a can
cer—either you "get" the cancer or it "gets" you.
Does Lindbergh presume for a moment that democ
racy can live surrounded by Fascism? Only two con
clusions can be drawn from his argument. Either he
wants Fascism or he is misguided in his reasoning to
such an extent that he can't understand that Fascism
doesn't reach maturity physically until it has no more
room in which to expand.
Keep up the good work, Mr. Low.

yHE EDITOR, SIR:
At the terrible risk of bringing down upon my
head the biting sarcasm of Stanford's isolationist
Moses, a certain Mr. Harrington, I would like to sug
gest that he examine the facts behind "Black Knight"
Low's discussion of Lindbergh before riding forth to
defend the slightly speckled "honor" of suffering
Colonel Lindbergh.
Mr. Low did not suggest that the Lone (and how!)
Eagle was competent to discuss aeronautics but not
foreign affairs and let the matter go at that. Your
very, very poor analogy involving Mr. Low, his ten
nis, and the United States' foreign policy suggested
that you read the lead of the column in question and
let the matter go at that. Mr. Low specifically cited
statements of Colonel (or is it Herr) Lindbergh which
lead any person who looks at the facts to only one
conclusion.
