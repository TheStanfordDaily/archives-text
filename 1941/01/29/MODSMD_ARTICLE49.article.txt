# LOW VS. LINDBERGH
## 
### 
HP HE EDITOR, SIR:
Bob Low, in his column published last Friday,
made a careless statement which should not go un
answered. He said, "Lindbergh, once the hero of mil
lions of Americans because of his historic flight across
the Atlantic, yesterday showed himself to be the man
whom millions of Americans will hate."
To swallow wholeheartedly Mr. Low's prophecy
"millions of Americans" will hate Lindbergh for his
testimony at the hearings on the lease-lend bill would
be a reflection on one's intelligence. Lindbergh de
scribed the lease-lend bill as a "major step" toward
hostilities and declared he wanted a victory for neither
side in the war because "it would be a disaster for
Europe if either side won." Contrary to Mr. Low's
opinion, this proposal is deserving of careful atten
tion. He seems to have forgotten completely there
may be another side to this question.
It will be recalled that many of those who opposed
our entrance into the first world war and who were
most rebuked by hysterical columnists were recog
nized as the real heroes after the world regained its
common sense.
In following Mr. Low's column it has seemed to us
that he is accepting blindly every administration pro
posal, and instead of commenting on the news, is just
writing it up without thinking critically about it.
And shall we start today, Mr. Low, to hate Lind
bergh?
