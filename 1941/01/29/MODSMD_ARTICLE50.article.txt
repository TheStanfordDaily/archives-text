LORD HALIFAX, right, successor to Lord Lothian as the British Ambassador to the United States, and
Lady Halifax are greeted in Annapolis. Md., by Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox as they come ashore
from the British battleship King George V which brought them from England. President Roosevelt and Lord
