# Hepburn Repeats Stage Hit in 'Philadelphia Story'
## 
### 
"THE PHILADELPHIA STORY," starring Katherine Hepburn, Cary
Grant and James Stewart.
It has become an axiom among movie-goers that Hollywood has never
seemed to be able to do one thing—transfer a show from the "legitimate"
stage to the screen without damaging it beyond recognition.
In producing "The Philadelphia Story," however, RKO lias broken
jinx. The plot, action and characters of this highly successful play have

improved, if anything, by the
movie producers, and show
should rank high on the list of
candidates for this Academy
Award.
The most obvious I'eason for this
unprecedented success is that the
star who "made" the play also plays
the lead in the movie. Katharine
Hepburn in the role of the spoiled,
prejudiced heroine of this fascinat
ing comedy has projected herself at
last onto the rolls of the really great
actresses of Hollywood.
PLOT TWISTING
The plot, of course, does not
wholly escape the destructive ma
chinations of the scenario writers.
The character of the magazine re
porter— played on the screen by
Jimmy Stewart —has been changed
from the leading male part to a
position secondary to that of "Ka
ty's" first husband.
This, of course, was necessary in
order to give Cary Grant—the first
husband—proper standing on the
cast.
JUST TOO PERFECT
It would be unfair to criticize the
picture on so petty a basis, how
ever — it's "just too perfect."
Whether you like Hepburn and her
accent, Grant and his good looks,
Stewart and his drawl, or Roland
Young and his dry humor, you'll
thoroughly enjoy "The Philadelphia
Story."—Minahan
