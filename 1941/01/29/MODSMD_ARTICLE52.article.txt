# Greeks Launch New Offensive
## Hellenic Forces Push Through Heavy Rains 
### 
ATHENS, Wed., Jan. 29 (UP).—A
large scale Greek offensive, launched
as the war with Italy entered its
fourth month, early today was re
ported along a 75-mile long front,
with Hellenic troops rushing
through Italian barbed wire en
tanglements in fierce bayonet
charges.
The assault, opened in some sec
tors in heavy rain and almost knee
deep mud, was said in front-line dis
patches to be pushing upon Italy's
Albanian port of Valona, toward
Berati above Klisura and up through
the mountains toward Elbasan fur
ther to the north.
The Italians, according to these
reports, threw swarms of tanks, in
fantry and bombing planes at the
Greeks in an effort to stall their
drive. Italian warships shelled
Greek rear lines along the Adriatic
coast south of Khimara to the
Greek frontier.
On the coastal front below Valona
Greek evzones and regular infantry
detachments were said to have
swept forward in bayonet charges
after their guns had pounded a
breach in Italian barbed wire.
In a desperate effort to recapture
lost ground, the Italians counter
attacked at least twice behind a
spearhead of medium and light
tanks. The tanks were hurled back,
it was reported, by Greek antiair
craft guns and several were de
stroyed or put out of commission.
In one Greek attack on a cluster
of houses in the central sector an
Italian garrison of 183 officers and
men was said to have been cap
tured.
The battle spread with increasing
intensity, accounts from the front
said — from the Klisura-Tepelini
zone northward toward the massive
sacred mountain of Tomor—the Al
banian Olympus. There were heavy
losses among Italian forces attempt
ing to defend the road to Berati.
