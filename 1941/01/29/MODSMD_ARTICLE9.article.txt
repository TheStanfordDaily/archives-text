# 'Eye to the Future' Encinaman Practices Amateur Barbering
## 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
Most anybody can be a hasher, most anybody ran be a laundry agent,
and most anybody can peddle magazines, but there's an ingenious lad
who is working a new angle on the old Encina game:
He's George Stimson, 19-year-old freshman Beta pledge from Pasa
dena, who is doing a whale of a hair-cutting business right in his own

room!
Just drop down to 120 Encina any
old time and George will fix you up
—he works on the theory that some
guys are good guys and other guys
patronize the professional barber
shops.
For George is an amateur —in the
broad sense of the word, that is.
The budding tonsorial artist never
charges his victims for the product
of his talents; his customers just
plink the customary two-bits in a
"contribution" bottle on their way
out.
George has been cutting hair ever
since he came up to the Farm last
September. He first learned how by
practicing on the Stimson's Chinese
cook, one Joe Jue, but he says, "Joe
didn't like it because his hair took a
month to grow back."
When George camc up to school,
lie told the boys he was from barber
college, set up shop, and went right
to work. George estimates he has
about 50 regulars who always come
back for more. Fifty customers at
two-bits a whack!
We walked in on him while he
was working over his roommate,
Henry Mears, the other day, and
George showed us just how he does
it, from start to finish. First, he |
takes any old chair that happens to
be handy, sits his customer on top !
of the back of the chair with the
customer's feet on the seat of the
chair, places a towel around the cus
tomer's neck, and a sheet, any old
sheet, over the whole works.
"I go to work with the hand j
shears and later I thin out the hair
with the scissors," he explained as
he took time out to peer across a \
desk bearing a sultry picture of a j
movie actress. He admitted that j
when he started cutting hair his only
instrument was a pair of paper j
shears.
STERILIZES TOOLS
George cleans his instruments
after every job in a sterilizing solu- j
tion. The whole thing is very sani- j
tary, except for the hair on the !
floor, which he lets the janitor worry j
about.
George polishes off every job
with a thorough massage, for which
he has prepared his own hair tonic, 1
"Stimson's Three Way." The label j
on the bottle says:
"Performs Three Vital Functions:
1. Perfumes (Gardenia de Kress).
2. Lubricates (335-5 M.H. oil).
3. Kills dandruff (Thymolycitate). i
Also contains vitamin B-l, which ;
invigorates the scalp and hair fol
licles."
George's time is your time, and J
the boys usually drop in after lunch
or dinner for a quick one. His i
roomie says, "I've even seen it hap
pen at 12 o'clock at night."

Most anybody can be a hasher, most anybody ran be a laundry agent,
and most anybody can peddle magazines, but there's an ingenious lad
who is working a new angle on the old Encina game:
He's George Stimson, 19-year-old freshman Beta pledge from Pasa
dena, who is doing a whale of a hair-cutting business right in his own

room!
Just drop down to 120 Encina any
old time and George will fix you up
—he works on the theory that some
guys are good guys and other guys
patronize the professional barber
shops.
For George is an amateur —in the
broad sense of the word, that is.
The budding tonsorial artist never
charges his victims for the product
of his talents; his customers just
plink the customary two-bits in a
"contribution" bottle on their way
out.
George has been cutting hair ever
since he came up to the Farm last
September. He first learned how by
practicing on the Stimson's Chinese
cook, one Joe Jue, but he says, "Joe
didn't like it because his hair took a
month to grow back."
When George camc up to school,
lie told the boys he was from barber
college, set up shop, and went right
to work. George estimates he has
about 50 regulars who always come
back for more. Fifty customers at
two-bits a whack!
We walked in on him while he
was working over his roommate,
Henry Mears, the other day, and
George showed us just how he does
it, from start to finish. First, he |
takes any old chair that happens to
be handy, sits his customer on top !
of the back of the chair with the
customer's feet on the seat of the
chair, places a towel around the cus
tomer's neck, and a sheet, any old
sheet, over the whole works.
"I go to work with the hand j
shears and later I thin out the hair
with the scissors," he explained as
he took time out to peer across a \
desk bearing a sultry picture of a j
movie actress. He admitted that j
when he started cutting hair his only
instrument was a pair of paper j
shears.
STERILIZES TOOLS
George cleans his instruments
after every job in a sterilizing solu- j
tion. The whole thing is very sani- j
tary, except for the hair on the !
floor, which he lets the janitor worry j
about.
George polishes off every job
with a thorough massage, for which
he has prepared his own hair tonic, 1
"Stimson's Three Way." The label j
on the bottle says:
"Performs Three Vital Functions:
1. Perfumes (Gardenia de Kress).
2. Lubricates (335-5 M.H. oil).
3. Kills dandruff (Thymolycitate). i
Also contains vitamin B-l, which ;
invigorates the scalp and hair fol
licles."
