ONE OF
THE OLDEST
TRADITIONS
STILL ALIVE "
It started about 1899 when "Sticky" Wilson was a stu
dent at Stanford and was making his candies in his first
little shop right on the Campus. Stanford Co-eds starred
the custom of announcing their engagements by passing
a five-pound box of "Sticky's" candies at the dinner table.
This custom has become a tradition at Stanford, and the
five-pound boxes of Wilson's Co-Ed Chocolates are still
being passed at dinner when engagements are announced.
