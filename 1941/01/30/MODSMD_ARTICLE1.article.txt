UNUSUAL controversy was
waged over the British Aid Bill
before the House Foreign Affairs
Committee yesterday.
The outcome was a vote to reject
an amendment which would have
banned use of United States war
ships to convoy war materials
abroad.
Secretary of War Henry L. Stim
son opposed the measure on the
grounds that such y provision would
handcuff the President, who is given
complete control over the army and
navy under the Constitution.
He was quoted as saying that it
would be a "bad thing" for Con
gress now to introduce a bill which
"even by implication would fetter a
power that existed untrammelled
for 150 years, even if the provision
had no efficacy." Mr. Stimson point
ed out further that such a law
"would indicate misapprehension
and would not contribute to unity."
Thereupon Senator Robert M.
LaFollette arose to remind Mr.
Stimson that in a speech made in
New England shortly before his
appointment to the cabinet the
secretary had advocated use of
U. S. convoys.
Asked whether he continued to
hold this view, Mr. Stimson replied
he now carries out policies laid
down by the President and "my
personal opinions are wholly ir
relevant."
But regardless of the action taken
yesterday which killed the amend
ment, it was predicted that the no
convoy provision would be written
into the bill either in committee or
on the floor of the House.
At a recent press conference
President Roosevelt assured re
porters that the administration was
not considered the use of convoys.
He described such a plan as a "haz
ardous undertaking."
The House committee yesterday
agreed on two other amendments:
one which would require the
President to make periodic reports
to Congress on action taken under
the bill; a second to require the
President to consult with military
and naval authorities before ship
ping war materials abroad.
All three of these measures were
demanded by opposition leaders.
One Congressman opposed to the
bill indicated that they would meet
all the objections he had heard to
the bill thus far.

17IGHT years ago today, Adolf
Hitler, leader of the German
National Socialist Party which could
not win a majority of voters in a
free election, was named chancellor
of Germany by doddering old Paul
von Hindenbui-g. Today, Hitler will
make his annual anniversary speech.
Speculation on what the Fueh
rer will touch upon has been based
primarily on the theory that he
will take this opportunity to an
swer President Roosevelt's "ar
senal of Democracy" speech. Al
ready he has asserted that Amer
ica's all-out aid to Britain will
come too late to save the British
from disaster and that "no power
on earth can delay Britain's fate."
German newspapers during the
past few days have predicted that
Britain will be overwhelmed with
the same precision as was shown
in the campaigns in the Lowlands
and in France. Several papers have
said the attack will come suddenly
and where least expected.

death of General John Me
taxas deprived Greece of her
foremost military strategist. Much
of Greece's success has been attrib
uted to his tactical genius.
The new premier, and virtual dic
tator, Alexander George Corizis, is
supposed to know little of military
matters. Greece's military leader
ship it is assumed will rest mainly
with Alexander Popagos, who has
been chief of staff.
What effect the absence of Metaxas
will have on the conflict in Albania
is difficult to predict. But the man
who amazed the world by defying
Mussolini and then achieved victory
after victory over superior forces is
gone.
