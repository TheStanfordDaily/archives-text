# Poll Reveals Farm Opinion On 'Jeanie'-ASCAP Feud
## 
### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
Praises have been sung to "Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair"
so often since Jan. 1 that her hair, as well as radio listeners', is fast
becoming gray. Who is principally at fault for the current radio
music dispute that's causing the death of our "Jeanie" and the dis
traction of the American radio audience?
In a survey of campus opinion conducted by The Stanford
Daily, 43 per cent of the students questioned blamed ASCAP for
the dispute. Closely following are 33 per cent of the cross
section who say that the National Association of Broadcasters
and BMI should share the blame equally with ASCAP. Only 19
per cent accuseu the broadcasters and BMI as being solely at
fault.
A breakdown of the cross-section according to class reveals
no definite trend, although in three classes less than a majority
blamed ASCAP.
ASCAP Broadcasters Both
Freshman 22% 7% 71%
Sophomore 59% 12% 29%
Junior 42% 21% 37%
Senior 65% 15% 20%
Graduate 31% 27% 42%
RADIO LISTENING AFFECTED
"How has the radio-music dispute affected your radio listen
ing?" was the supplementary question asked the cross-section.
A significant portion—34 per cent—replied it "listened less" since
ASCAP music was cut off the air. Nevertheless, 62 per cent re
vealed they listened to the radio the same amount as before.
Oddly enough, 4 per cent answered "listen more."
An analysis of the question according to sex shows the fol
lowing:
Listen Less Same More
Men 36% 58% 6%
Women 30% 70% 0%
(Any percentage less than 1 is considered 0)
COMMENTS DEROGATE ASCAP
Comments revealed that a small proportion of the students
were undecided as to who should be blamed. "Whose fault—
that's what I would like to know." Most comments were deroga
tory toward ASCAP, few praised the broadcasters. A junior hall
man said, "I sanction the ends ASCAP seeks, but not the means
they're using." Typical of many comments was, "I listen the
same, but I don't enjoy it."

fault.
A breakdown of the cross-section according to class reveals
no definite trend, although in three classes less than a majority
blamed ASCAP.
ASCAP Broadcasters Both
Freshman 22% 7% 71%
Sophomore 59% 12% 29%
Junior 42% 21% 37%
Senior 65% 15% 20%
Graduate 31% 27% 42%
RADIO LISTENING AFFECTED
"How has the radio-music dispute affected your radio listen
ing?" was the supplementary question asked the cross-section.
A significant portion—34 per cent—replied it "listened less" since
ASCAP music was cut off the air. Nevertheless, 62 per cent re
vealed they listened to the radio the same amount as before.
Oddly enough, 4 per cent answered "listen more."
An analysis of the question according to sex shows the fol
lowing:
Listen Less Same More
Men 36% 58% 6%
Women 30% 70% 0%
(Any percentage less than 1 is considered 0)
COMMENTS DEROGATE ASCAP
Comments revealed that a small proportion of the students
were undecided as to who should be blamed. "Whose fault—
that's what I would like to know." Most comments were deroga
tory toward ASCAP, few praised the broadcasters. A junior hall
man said, "I sanction the ends ASCAP seeks, but not the means
they're using." Typical of many comments was, "I listen the
same, but I don't enjoy it."
Praises have been sung to "Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair"
so often since Jan. 1 that her hair, as well as radio listeners', is fast
becoming gray. Who is principally at fault for the current radio
music dispute that's causing the death of our "Jeanie" and the dis
traction of the American radio audience?
In a survey of campus opinion conducted by The Stanford
Daily, 43 per cent of the students questioned blamed ASCAP for
the dispute. Closely following are 33 per cent of the cross
section who say that the National Association of Broadcasters
and BMI should share the blame equally with ASCAP. Only 19
per cent accuseu the broadcasters and BMI as being solely at
fault.
