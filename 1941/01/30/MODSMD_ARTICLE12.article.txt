# Luncheon Club Hears Refugee
## 
### 
From the Golden Horn of Istanbul
to the Golden Gate of San Fran
cisco came Dr. Susanne Engle
mann, refugee from Germany.
Speaking to the Luncheon Club
yesterday, Dr. Englemann told both
humorous and gruesome experiences
of her trip through Russia, China,
and Japan. She was amused at the
Russian customs officer who sus
piciously examined her copies of
the "New Testament" and "Tale of
Two Cities." Both Dr. Englemann
and her large audience were shock
ed at the picture of men wearing
masks in plague-stricken China.
