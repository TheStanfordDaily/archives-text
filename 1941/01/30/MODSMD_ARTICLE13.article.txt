THE DALLES, Ore., Jan. 29 (UP).
—Fire destroyed a strange dugout
"roothouse" near here today, taking
two lives and seriously burning a
third man.
Pete Jackson, Indian, and a white
man known only as "Harry" lost
their lives when their shelter dug
into the roots of a big tree burned.
A third man, Ed Thomas, Indian,
escaped by crawling through the
flames to the door of the hut. Thomas
suffered burns about the face and
hands.
The fire started from an open stove
that heated the flimsy dugout.
