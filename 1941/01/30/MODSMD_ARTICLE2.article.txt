l '3t, Joan," a high tragvdy by
George Bernard Shaw, opens to
night in Memorial Theater at 8:15
o'clock for a three-night run.
Not since last year's production of
"Richard II" has such effort gone
into any play to produce acting, sets,
and costumes worthy of a profes
sional theater. If you don't like the
actors or the acting, go to see the
sets and costumes, or vice versa.
Don't be scared away by the term
"tragedy," the show is being played
for laughs as well as drama and
Shaw's inimitable humor will be
played to the hilt.
TALENTED CAST
A cast has been selected from the
University's best talent and is really
worthy of a Shaw play. Playing the
lead will be Janice Schwenson, a
newcomer who has promise, as was
demonstrated when she played a
leading role in "The Poor of New
York."
Bud Cady will play the Dauphin,
while Ted Marcuse will take the
part of the Earl of Warwick, arch
enemy of Joan. John de Stogumber
(Frank Burt) chaplain of Winches
ter, is the power behind the English
throne who plots Joan's death.
Tremouille, the lord chamberlain
of France (Keith Allan), is also an

by his wife, the Duchess (Mary
