A NEW ERA

adays are being written to econo- j
mize on talent and that the decline i
of the theater is sure to continue, Dr. j
Heffner stressed new chances in the [
"American amusement industry,"
whose scope he declared was limit

mined to storm- Broadway, he said,
.she must have experience gained in
a summer theater, general back
ground, utter confidence, a truly
.splendid wardrobe, and a "lot of
brass."
Mrs. Morris, for 15 years a mem
ber of the board of trustees of the j
Pasadena Playhouse, described the j
careers of several prominent film !
players and pointed out that talent !

Alto, Mr. Welles cautioned the

that there were more opportunities
vocationally for men than for women.
"Don't turn to the theater voca

RADIO WORK
From her first job—screaming in
an Oakland radio murder mystery—
Miss Isabel Goldthwaite, Stanford
38, turned to writing continuities,
commercials, and sales promotion for
KSFO.
Splitting the chances for a new
comer's making good in radio, Miss
Goldthwaite said that a good begin
ning is half luck, half "grim de
termination."
FROM BOTTOM WORK
"The best ways to get into radio
are through secretarial work and
through an apprenticeship at a small
radio station," Miss Goldthwaite
said. "Of the two, a year's work in
a small station is far preferable."
Other ways of entering the field
are through advertising agencies and
through dramatic training, she said,
and added that there are few open
ings in the large networks except
via small-station experience.
Chairmen for this second Vocom
meeting were Rosamond Upson and
Claire Burtchaell.

RADIO WORK
From her first job—screaming in
an Oakland radio murder mystery—
Miss Isabel Goldthwaite, Stanford
38, turned to writing continuities,
commercials, and sales promotion for
KSFO.
Splitting the chances for a new
comer's making good in radio, Miss
Goldthwaite said that a good begin

termination."
FROM BOTTOM WORK
"The best ways to get into radio
are through secretarial work and
through an apprenticeship at a small
radio station," Miss Goldthwaite
said. "Of the two, a year's work in
a small station is far preferable."
Other ways of entering the field
are through advertising agencies and
through dramatic training, she said,
and added that there are few open
ings in the large networks except
via small-station experience.

RADIO WORK
From her first job—screaming in
an Oakland radio murder mystery—
Miss Isabel Goldthwaite, Stanford
38, turned to writing continuities,
commercials, and sales promotion for
KSFO.
Splitting the chances for a new
comer's making good in radio, Miss
Goldthwaite said that a good begin
ning is half luck, half "grim de
termination."
FROM BOTTOM WORK
"The best ways to get into radio
are through secretarial work and
through an apprenticeship at a small
radio station," Miss Goldthwaite
said. "Of the two, a year's work in
a small station is far preferable."
Other ways of entering the field
are through advertising agencies and
through dramatic training, she said,
and added that there are few open
ings in the large networks except
via small-station experience.
Chairmen for this second Vocom
meeting were Rosamond Upson and
Claire Burtchaell.
