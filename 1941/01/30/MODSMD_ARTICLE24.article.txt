# Union Profits Redistributed For Memorial Theater Fund
## 
### 
A special rearrangement of Union profit dividends to cover all interest
charges on Memorial Theater was effected at the last meeting of the Union
Board of Governors, according to Dick Stepp, student manager.
While the Union will continue to donate the first 75 per cent of its
profits toward the general Memorial Theater fund, by the new arrange-

lament the Union will commence ap
plying part of the remaining 25 per
cent surplus to interest charges.
By the new arrangement, it is
hoped that the original 75 per cent
now can be applied solely on the
principle of the debt, instead of on
both principle and interest as in the
past.
'A SINKING FUND'
The 25 per cent will be ti'eated
somewhat as a sinking fund when
normal A.S.S.U. funds are unable
, to meet the interest charges. Should
j the interest deficit be greater than
25 per cent of Union profits, how
ever, the Union is relieved of re
sponsibility.
The theater, which was completed
! and ready for use in the fall of 1937,
i was built at a cost of $500,000 by the
Associated Students. The A.S.S.U.
could pay only a part of this cost
outright, and even taking advan
tage of gifts and funds made avail
able by the administration, it was
still necessary to make a loan of
| $330,000.
INSUFFICIENT FUNDS
! This sum was borrowed from the
j University to build the theater,
j which, when completed was a gift to
: the University from the A.S.S.U.
j This debt of $330,000 draws 5 per
| cent interest charges and this year
j the interest will amount to $13,546.
I The A.S.S.U. funds would have
; been insufficient to meet the whole
j of this sum and it would have been
i necessary to dig into the 75 per cent
! Union donation which cuts down on
J the amount applied to the principal
i of the debt.
This exigency has been overcome
jby the present arrangement, ac
cording to Stepp.
