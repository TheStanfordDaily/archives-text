## 
### 
In a game characterized by sloppy
base-running, Stanford's varsity j
baseball club managed to eke out a
2-1 win over Kencally's Seals yes- j
terday afternoon.
The Seals, made up of major and
minor league stars, took the lead in
the first half of the third inning
when Wight got on base on a field
er's choice, and went to second on
the play on Mathewson at third base.
Lodigiani, outfield star of the Phila
delphia Athletics, singled to bring
Wight home.
Stanford lost a golden opportunity
to score in the last half of the fourth
when Hal Costello went to sleep and
was caught off third base. In the
same inning Babe Dahlgren showed
some of the fielding genius that en
ables him to hold down first base
for the New York Yankees when he
went high into the air to cut off a j
line drive that had looked like a !
sure hit.
DOUBLE FOR JENNINGS
Ted Jennings started out the first (
half of the sixth with a double and
Purkitt, Indian chukker, looked like
he was in for a bad time when he
walked Lloyd Christopher, star ;
center-fielder, for the Oakland Oaks, j
The next three men up went down j
in a row, however, Dahlgren strik- !
ing out and Ratto popping up to j
"Ace" Hanlon. Jensen flied to Pfyl
to end the rally.
What looked to be a promising 1
Stanford rally in the last half of the
sixth when Alex Cereghino got on
first on an infield hit and was sacri- '
ficed to second by Monte Pfyl ended |
when Costello and Hanlon fanned to J
finish the inning.
RALLY IN SEVENTH
Stanford's big rally came in the
last half of the seventh inning
when Parsons got on with a single
and went to second on an error by
Dahlgren. He was caught off second
and Boone walked. Ditlevsen's sin
gle and a combination of an infield
hit by Graham and an error by the
Seals' pitcher filled the bases.
"Cootie" Thompson was safe on
first on a fielder's choice wlhile
Boone scored and Graham was out
at second. Hammett flied to right
field to end the inning.
In the last half of the eighth Cos
tello singled and stole second on a
bad throw by Kearse, Seal catcher. I
He went to third on an infield out
and came home with the winning
run when the pitcher dropped a wild
throw from the catcher and fell
down trying to recover the ball.
