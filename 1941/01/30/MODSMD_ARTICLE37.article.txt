# Indian Hoopmen Leave Tonight For Two-Game Bruin Series
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity hoop squad, which leads the rest of the pack in the
race for the championship of the Southern Division of the Pacific Coast
Conference, yesterday skipped through a speedy workout, with another
practicc session on tap for this afternoon before the Indians entrain tonight
for the Southland to take on U.C.L.A. in two games this week-end.

The Bruin five used to be the out- (
fit on which the rest of the confer
ence teams fattened their averages,
but with Coach Wilbur Johns' new
deal for basketball at the Westwood
institution, things have changed
considerably.
The Bruins' attempt to climb out
of the cellar spot this season was
predicted by Stanford's Coach Ev
erett Dean before the year's com
petition began, and Dean still doesn't
see anything wrong with Ucla's bet
tering itself as long as his Indians
aren't the victims.
And that is just the reason why
the genial Stanford coach and his
cagers are not taking this week-end's
clashes too lightly. They know that
this season the Bruins can and often
do play good basketballl. Besides,
staying on top of the heap in a
confex-ence as tough as this one is a
tough assignment for any outfit,
even these red-hot Indians.
This week has seen and is seeing

a lot of work by the Cards on
smoothing out their offense — even
though it looked plenty smooth
against Santa Clara Monday night—
as well as some practice on defense
against Ucla maneuvers.
