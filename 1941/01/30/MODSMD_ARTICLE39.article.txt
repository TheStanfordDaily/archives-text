## JERRY BRUCKER, Sports Editor Frosh Cagers Slate Twin Bill For Week-end 
### 
After their sensational 32-28
photo-finish victory over the Santa
Clara freshmen three nights ago,
Stanford's yearling cagers have been
getting up steam for a double header
slated for the coming week-endâ€”
Modesto J. C. and San Jose High
School.
Experts still talk of the amazing
team that stymied the Bronco
babes Monday eve in a wild over
time period with Jim Pollard com
ing through in the clutch to fire the
winning buckets.
In the extra session Colt Stan Pat
rick drove in for a set-up at the
tipofT to put the 'Clarans in front,
and it looked for a moment like
they might stay there. But Coach
Beeb Lee inserted Dick West in the
line-up, and West, cool as a cucum
ber, calmly proceeded to dump in a
one-handed push shot from the key
hole to tie the score.
POLLARD TO RESCUE
Came Pollard to the rescue with
one of the most beautiful shots of
the evening. As Bill Hooper's lofty
field goal try began to fall short of
the backboard, Pollard zoomed un
der the basket, smacked the ball in
mid-air and gently nursed it
through the net cords for the win
ning tally. He followed a moment
later with another from outside the
slot to put the game on ice, 32-28.
MODESTO STRONG
Modesto smothered San Jose State
frosh, 59-36, while the locals beat
the Spartans by a mere 7 points.
But Santa Clara took the Modestans,
46-39, and going on that score, the
Papoose five should be able to add
another scalp to their already im
posing victory string of 9 wins.
In place of the Hollister J. C. game
that was scheduled for Saturday
night, the yearlings will take on San
Jose High School in the Pavilion at
3 o'clock Saturday afternoon. The
Hollister game has been cancelled.
