THE underpass which has served as a giant
barrier between the Farm and Palo Alto for
so long is about finished. With elaborate cere
mony the City Council and all officialdom ei
ther closely or remotely concerned will offer
speeches and paeans of praise. The barriers will
go down.
And cars will once more resume their swift
and normal course from Palm Drive into Uni
versity Avenue.
That time is still a month or more in the future.
But initiation of direct travel to Paly will be an
innovation to Stanford's freshman class. The
men and women of '44 have never seen the
time when it has been possible to drive from the
Varsity Theater to the Ad Building without any
seriously abrupt turning.
If they bothered to read to page 57 of their
Frosh Bibles, though, they've heard about what
that book's editors hopefully called "a tradition."
There they may have seen these words:
Rides to Paly—Diagonally across from the
History Corner, at the campus end of Palm
Drive, and at the Roos Bros, corner in Palo
Alto, car-less Farm men and women will await
the aid of their more fortunate classmates.
Tradition rules that those with care pick up
those without.
For the past year "rides-to-Paly" has taken a
bad shellacking—principally from thoughtless
Stanfordites who have, unconsciously, used the
underpass construction as an excuse to over
look those of us who've been standing on the
corner, waiting and waiting.
Like the half-dozen other full-grown Stanford
traditions, ''rides-to-Paly" was born in a spirit of
friendly co-operation. No great amount of repeti
tive preaching was required to convince Stan
ford men and women that it was a good custom,
for it arose spontaneously. No further reitera
tion should be necessary for Stanford men and
women to continue a useful and democratic
practice.

men and women of '44 have never seen the
time when it has been possible to drive from the
Varsity Theater to the Ad Building without any
seriously abrupt turning.
If they bothered to read to page 57 of their
Frosh Bibles, though, they've heard about what
that book's editors hopefully called "a tradition."
There they may have seen these words:
Rides to Paly—Diagonally across from the
History Corner, at the campus end of Palm
Drive, and at the Roos Bros, corner in Palo
Alto, car-less Farm men and women will await
the aid of their more fortunate classmates.
Tradition rules that those with care pick up
those without.
For the past year "rides-to-Paly" has taken a
bad shellacking—principally from thoughtless
Stanfordites who have, unconsciously, used the
underpass construction as an excuse to over
look those of us who've been standing on the
corner, waiting and waiting.
Like the half-dozen other full-grown Stanford
traditions, ''rides-to-Paly" was born in a spirit of
friendly co-operation. No great amount of repeti
tive preaching was required to convince Stan
ford men and women that it was a good custom,
for it arose spontaneously. No further reitera
tion should be necessary for Stanford men and
women to continue a useful and democratic
practice.
