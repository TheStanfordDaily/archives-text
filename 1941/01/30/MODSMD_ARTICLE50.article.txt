A THO gives a damn what we think?" asked
V V a Stanford student who was a bit hesitant
about drawing any profound conclusions on the
present status of international affairs.
"Take that and multiply by approximately
13,000,000 and you've got the inner feelings of
the young men and women of this nation," say
many persons.
And no doubt there are countless millions of
America's youth who do feel that their inner sen
timents are not being considered in the negotia
tions that are presently going on in Washington.
These millions claim that words are being put
in their mouths by every newspaper editor and
news commentator. They are quoted in the
papers, and no one seems to know where the
words came from.
But they will admit to you that "some few
youth groups, largely in the Eastern states, have
attempted to take the burden of speaking for the
'youth of America' upon their own shoulders.
Most of these have turned into dismal flops."
The question must then necessarily arise as to
whether these expressions failed because they
were not representative of the youth of the
country, or, and this is important, because youth
is not capable of speaking for itself intelligently
in a crisis such as this. If the latter is true, then
such attempts at expression are always bound
to fail.
Furthermore, it takes some imagination for
a young American to think that he is not being
represented in Washington at present. If he (or
she) is opposed to the Lend-Lease Bill, there are
always on their side Senator Burton K. Wheeler,
Senator Hiram Johnson, Colonel Charles A. Lind
bergh, and others who believe that the bill as it

stands now will direct us into the European war.
If the young American believes that this coun
try is under obligation to throw America's re
sources to the side of democracy, he has Presi
dent Roosevelt, Wendell Willkie, Senator Carter
Glass to represent him.
It may well be true that these men are not con
sidering the thoughts of young America while
they feint and spar verbally, but the result is the
same. What they are doing is deciding youth's
fate in this country, and no young person in
America can rightfully say that his is a voice
crying in the wilderness.
And if they doubt the wisdom of a patriarchy,
let them consider the possibility of a govern
ment or society on any other basis. One has to
have lived a long time to be able to help others
live. Leadership is more than emotion, it is ma
ture reason. It is built on experience founded
in heartbreak, achievement, and understanding.
Even that section of America's youth that cries
out against patriarchy must see that.
It is true that youth always bears the brunt
of patriarchal mistakes, but it is also youth that
benefits by patriarchal wisdom in the longest
run.—G. M.

It may well be true that these men are not con
sidering the thoughts of young America while
they feint and spar verbally, but the result is the
same. What they are doing is deciding youth's
fate in this country, and no young person in
America can rightfully say that his is a voice
crying in the wilderness.
And if they doubt the wisdom of a patriarchy,
let them consider the possibility of a govern
ment or society on any other basis. One has to
have lived a long time to be able to help others
live. Leadership is more than emotion, it is ma
ture reason. It is built on experience founded
in heartbreak, achievement, and understanding.
Even that section of America's youth that cries
out against patriarchy must see that.
It is true that youth always bears the brunt
of patriarchal mistakes, but it is also youth that
benefits by patriarchal wisdom in the longest
run.—G. M.
A THO gives a damn what we think?" asked
V V a Stanford student who was a bit hesitant
about drawing any profound conclusions on the
present status of international affairs.
"Take that and multiply by approximately
13,000,000 and you've got the inner feelings of
the young men and women of this nation," say
many persons.
And no doubt there are countless millions of
America's youth who do feel that their inner sen
timents are not being considered in the negotia
tions that are presently going on in Washington.
These millions claim that words are being put
in their mouths by every newspaper editor and
news commentator. They are quoted in the
papers, and no one seems to know where the
words came from.
But they will admit to you that "some few
youth groups, largely in the Eastern states, have
attempted to take the burden of speaking for the
'youth of America' upon their own shoulders.
Most of these have turned into dismal flops."
The question must then necessarily arise as to
whether these expressions failed because they
were not representative of the youth of the
country, or, and this is important, because youth
is not capable of speaking for itself intelligently
in a crisis such as this. If the latter is true, then
such attempts at expression are always bound
to fail.
Furthermore, it takes some imagination for
a young American to think that he is not being
represented in Washington at present. If he (or
she) is opposed to the Lend-Lease Bill, there are
always on their side Senator Burton K. Wheeler,
Senator Hiram Johnson, Colonel Charles A. Lind
bergh, and others who believe that the bill as it

stands now will direct us into the European war.
If the young American believes that this coun
try is under obligation to throw America's re
sources to the side of democracy, he has Presi
dent Roosevelt, Wendell Willkie, Senator Carter
Glass to represent him.
