A YEAR AGO—A YEAR AHEAD?
through a tear, today makes a year since . .
Since what? What has happened in that year?
Oh, many, many things in general. In particular, there
has been a swelling change in the gray-matter of you
people—or rather, in the way you use that gray
matter.
What all this means was so ably expressed in the
last copy of New Yorker magazine:
Just as a man slowly dying from some incurable
disease seldom realizes that he is a little bit worse from
day to day, so a nation sick with fever for war is
not apt to be aware how fast and how deep the in
fection is spreading."
This is a rational and well-considered statement.
You ha\je all been bitten by the war bug. And the
fever has spread. But every day there is that fever—
possibly a little worse. But by now that fever is a
part of you, like coffee in the morning, or a puff on a
cigarette, or taking off a sock.
You're no longer conscious of it because it is no
longer new.

j-JOW SO? Did you ever think what you or your
fellow students said a year ago today under greatly
similar world conditions?
In this week, a year ago, your Excom refused a
plan to send aid to the Finns who, you will remember,
were then fighting the Russians. The next day, in an
editorial on this refusal, one writer said:
. Today we are only arguing about giving
civilian aid relief to a belligerent. But if some group,
even though it be one as significant as the Associated
Students of Stanford University, does not stand up and
point out that such aid is not neutral, next year we
may be haranguing over a far more serious question."
Then, it was a question and a quarrel over sending
just civilian aid to the remote Finns.
One of you in a Campus Opinion letter even went
so far then as to scald President Wilbur, when you
said:
"Dr. Wilbur in his opposition to the A.S.S.U.'s
stand on the Finnish relief fails pitifully to distin
guish between neutrality and humanitarianism."
Then, it was a question and a quarrel over neutral
ity versus humanitarianism,

r FODAY is a year later. And what do you say
today?
A portion of one of yesterday's Campus Opinion
letters said: "When dealing with a malignant growth
like Fascism, one can't compromise. It may be com
pared to a cancer—either you "get" the cancer or it
"gets" you.
Now, it is only a question of "getting" the cancer
first.
And in the last student poll, 72 per cent of you said
that you believed that the United States will enter the
war. And 74 per cent of you approved of the Lend-
Lease Bill, which makes civilian relief to the Finns
look smaller than passing out nickels to a panhandler.
How you have changed in your thought.
What will you be saying, or doing, or possibly won't
be physically able to do a year from today?
So smile through a tear, 'til this time next year . . .
