T"HE EDITOR, SIR:
Yesterday's Campus Opinioner, Jack Becket,
claims to have boiled when he read my letter about
Lindbergh. The effect of the boiling was monstrous, I
can assure him, for the heat must have scrambled his
brains.
That, at any rate, is the most obvious explanation
for an argument like this one of Jack Becket's: Lind
bergh is an authority on aviation; Lindbergh was
a.sked questions by a Congressional committee; there
fore no one should say Lindbergh is an expert on
world politics.
But this ambisenseless Mr. Becket, admittedly,
gives us an alternative reason for his logical arterio
sclerosis—besides, that is, the possible organic horrors
of overheating. Becket says, "I am inclined to agree
with DNB, 'what kind of a country is this?"'
Deutsche Nauchrichten Buro knows quite well what
kind of a country this is, and asks the question for
rhetorical reasons only. If Jack Becket asks the ques
tion in the same vein, then let him say so, and we
will know that his talk of democracy is typical DNB
hypocrisy.
Without such an admission, we must be kind to
Jack Becket, and assume that he is ideologically
straight, but has just overheated his head.
Sincerely,
Greg
