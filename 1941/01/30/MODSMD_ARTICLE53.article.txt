"PHE EDITOR, SIR:
"Not. a Tennis Star's"' two-bits worth in a re
cent Daily Campus Opinion repels me, not alone be
cause of its seamy logic but because the author could
easily have said what he had to say in about one
paragraph.
Did Mr. Harrington say he was an Isolationist? Has
anyone accused and proved Mr. Harrington to be an
Isolationist? Look at the facts, Mr. "Not a Tennis Star."
The point in question was Mr. Low's competency
to declare Mr. Lindbergh's incompetency with regard
to the truth of the foreign situation. After we have
decided this point, then it will be time to pass on
Lindy's testimonial merits.
Personally, I'm hot for the latter occasion.
Sincerely,
J.L.
