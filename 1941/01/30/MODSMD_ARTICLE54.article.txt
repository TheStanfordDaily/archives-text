Except for a few minor difficulties,
preparations for Encina Hall's open
ing social event of the year, the
Shipwreck Dance tomorrow night in
the Encina lobby, are going along
very well, according to Bud Crary,
dance chairman.
Among the minor difficulties is
the recalling of several hundred
tickets, which were distributed to
salesmen before being checked
through the A.S.S.U. office.
TICKETS RECALLED
Since a great many bids had al
ready been sold, the command to
call them back from Business Man
ager Dick Stepp caused a great deal ,
of hurried work by Eric Hauser and
his ticket committee. However, this
misunderstanding has been straight
ened out and sales are now running
smoothly.
Carvel Craig's orchestra and his
featured vocalist, Miss Sherry Ber
gen, will play for the affair.
A scow, which will play the part
of the S. S. Encina wrecked on the
"Rock," has been borrowed from
the Palo Alto Yacht Club and will
be moved into the Encina lobby
some time tomorrow by the fresh- ;
men.
COSTUMES—WHOOPS!
Guests, who will '"wear what they
wore when the ship went down,"
will dance on a temporary palm
island constructed by Ted Eberle
and his decorations crew. A gang
plank will be used as the entrance
to the dance.
Encina residents may buy bids
for 50 cents and outsiders for one
dollar from any one of the follow
ing: Bud Crary, Rod Wheeler, Eric
Hauser, Bill Reich, Bob Rucker,
Bob McClean, Ed Gibbs, Jack
Rieser.

man, Jcre McWethy, Vic Ferrari,
