# Many Men Wait While 200 Daisy Maes Pick Best Abners
## 
### 
According to latest returns, more than 200 Farm women have picked
their men for the Sadie Hawkins Hop and plunked their $1.97 down on the
A.S.S.U. office counter.
After three days of the ticket sale, nearly one-half of the tickets have
been sold, the figures reveal. With a full week remaining before the

.dance on Feb. 7, it is anticipated that
latecomers will be left with men
on their hands and no place to go.
Art McCue and his band, garbed
in appropriate Ozark styles, will
minister musically to Farm Daisy
Maes and their Abners at the dance
which is to be held in the Women's
Gym from 9:30 to 1.
This late starting time is causing
women no end of trouble over pre
dance entertainment, according to
reliable sources. It has brought home
to them the problem of budgeting a
dateâ€”a fact which will no doubt
cause Stanford men a small bit of
elation.
As for costumes, Pat Adams,
chairman, has said, "The more rug
ged, the better." In practice this
will probably result in jeans and
loud shirts for men, loud, brief
ginghams for women.
Gaieties stars are still scheduled
to entertain the crowd of Ozark ac
ceptables and it is expected that
such notables as Dana Winters,
Adolfo Arias and Patty Bouchard
will perform.
Chairman Adams yesterday stress
ed the importance of getting tickets
as soon as possible in view of the
fact that visitors from Cal who will
be here for the basketball game will
also be clamoring for tickets.
