# Stanford Fivers May Obtain Plane
## 
### 
With the prospect of obtaining
their own plane, all members of the
Stanford Flying Club will meet in
the clubroom at the airport tonight
at 7:30 o'clock.
If enough members are present,
the exclusive use of a light plane at
a reduced rate is assured. An army
pilot, whose name is unannounced,
will talk on military aviation. All
active members are urged to be
present, and others interested in
aviation are invited.
