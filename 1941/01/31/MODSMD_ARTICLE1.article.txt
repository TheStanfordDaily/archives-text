### BOB LOW 
HITLER pulled on his kid
gloves yesterday and stalked
into the Berlin Sports Palace for his
eighth anniversary speech to the
German people.
The kid gloves were for the
United States, for if Adolf had been
sitting around the Chancellery for
the last few nights trying to dope
out a few nice, smooth, innocuous
things to say to Mr. Roosevelt, he
couldn't have done better. Obvious
ly Hitler wasn't very eager to an
tagonize the American public.
He did indicate, of course, that
any American convoys escorting
British ships laden with war sup
plies will he torpedoed. That came
as a surprise to no one. Even the
Congressmen who voted down the
proposal to prevent the President
from sending convoys probably
realized that, if those armed ships
were sent, they'd be the target of
Nazi raiders.
Hitler also warned Americans that
if we have any thoughts in the back
of our heads of intervening in Eu
rope at the moment he is poised for
that long-awaited "knockout" blow
against England, Germany "will
quickly change her objective." This,
too, comprises no great revelation to
the average citizen. In fact, Adolf
noised it around yesterday that Ger
many wishes to avoid war with the
United States. And the audience of
13,000 that heard him speak clapped
loudest at this statement.
* * *
r JpHE thread of significance that
wound in and out of the Fueh
rer's 91-minute oration may lead to
a few interesting conclusions. It
seemed to show that Hitler believes
the war is in its last stages, that a
German victory is in the cards, and
that peace treaties will be signed
very soon. That would explain his
allusion to "last-minute" assistance
to England. And that assumption
would clarify his motives for not
wishing to irritate Mr. and Mrs. Av
erage American with too loud a pro
test against U.S. unneutrality.
Hitler walked lightly and po
litely yesterday, and glanced over
his shoulder to see how Washing
ton was taking it.

jyjEANWHILE, the United States
government's investigation of
the industrial "bottle-necks" that
have been hampering the flow of de
fense materials blossomed into a
written indictment against the Alu
minum Company of America. The
Federal Grand Jury charged that
the trust has combined with the
German Dye Trust and several
other concerns to create a situation
in which Germany has been getting
at least four times as much magne
sium a year as the United States.
If the charges introduced by the
Grand Jury arc true —and it seems
almost certain that they are—this
case will be probably the most im
portant one before the Department
of Justice in the last year. The
government has been preparing its
case against the six corporations
and nine individuals for some
time. It has all the aspects of a
gigantic "international expose"
that may reveal how German con
spiracy restricted U. S. output to
one producer.
The aircraft industry has had
great difficulty in securing adequate
supplies of magnesium, an essential
product. The delay can be traced to
a serious shortage of foundry facil
ities for the production of the metal.
According to the Department of
Justice, the price, too, has been
maintained at "artificially and un
reasonably high levels" in contrast
to the price quoted for the metal
abroad. And, at the same time, only
one magnesium producer has been
allowed to exist in the United
States.
If the jury can discover the com
plex financial and patent relations
that tie the American branch of the
industry to I. G. Farbenindustrie of
Germany, they will be taking an
additional step to speed production
of so necessary a commodity.

jyjEANWHILE, the United States
government's investigation of
the industrial "bottle-necks" that
have been hampering the flow of de
fense materials blossomed into a
written indictment against the Alu
minum Company of America. The
Federal Grand Jury charged that
the trust has combined with the
German Dye Trust and several
other concerns to create a situation
in which Germany has been getting
at least four times as much magne
sium a year as the United States.
If the charges introduced by the
Grand Jury arc true —and it seems
almost certain that they are—this
case will be probably the most im
portant one before the Department
of Justice in the last year. The
government has been preparing its
case against the six corporations
and nine individuals for some
time. It has all the aspects of a
gigantic "international expose"
that may reveal how German con
spiracy restricted U. S. output to
one producer.
The aircraft industry has had
great difficulty in securing adequate
supplies of magnesium, an essential
product. The delay can be traced to
a serious shortage of foundry facil
ities for the production of the metal.
According to the Department of
Justice, the price, too, has been
maintained at "artificially and un
reasonably high levels" in contrast
to the price quoted for the metal
abroad. And, at the same time, only
one magnesium producer has been
allowed to exist in the United
States.
If the jury can discover the com
plex financial and patent relations
that tie the American branch of the
industry to I. G. Farbenindustrie of
Germany, they will be taking an
additional step to speed production
of so necessary a commodity.
HITLER pulled on his kid
gloves yesterday and stalked
into the Berlin Sports Palace for his
eighth anniversary speech to the
German people.
The kid gloves were for the
United States, for if Adolf had been
sitting around the Chancellery for
the last few nights trying to dope
out a few nice, smooth, innocuous
things to say to Mr. Roosevelt, he
couldn't have done better. Obvious
ly Hitler wasn't very eager to an
tagonize the American public.
He did indicate, of course, that
any American convoys escorting
British ships laden with war sup
plies will he torpedoed. That came
as a surprise to no one. Even the
Congressmen who voted down the
proposal to prevent the President
from sending convoys probably
realized that, if those armed ships
were sent, they'd be the target of
Nazi raiders.
Hitler also warned Americans that
if we have any thoughts in the back
of our heads of intervening in Eu
rope at the moment he is poised for
that long-awaited "knockout" blow
against England, Germany "will
quickly change her objective." This,
too, comprises no great revelation to
the average citizen. In fact, Adolf
noised it around yesterday that Ger
many wishes to avoid war with the
United States. And the audience of
13,000 that heard him speak clapped
loudest at this statement.
* * *
r JpHE thread of significance that
wound in and out of the Fueh
rer's 91-minute oration may lead to
a few interesting conclusions. It
seemed to show that Hitler believes
the war is in its last stages, that a
German victory is in the cards, and
that peace treaties will be signed
very soon. That would explain his
allusion to "last-minute" assistance
to England. And that assumption
would clarify his motives for not

HITLER pulled on his kid
gloves yesterday and stalked
into the Berlin Sports Palace for his
eighth anniversary speech to the
German people.
The kid gloves were for the
United States, for if Adolf had been
sitting around the Chancellery for
the last few nights trying to dope
out a few nice, smooth, innocuous
things to say to Mr. Roosevelt, he
couldn't have done better. Obvious
ly Hitler wasn't very eager to an
tagonize the American public.
He did indicate, of course, that
any American convoys escorting
British ships laden with war sup
plies will he torpedoed. That came
as a surprise to no one. Even the
Congressmen who voted down the
proposal to prevent the President
from sending convoys probably
realized that, if those armed ships
were sent, they'd be the target of
Nazi raiders.
Hitler also warned Americans that
if we have any thoughts in the back
of our heads of intervening in Eu
rope at the moment he is poised for
that long-awaited "knockout" blow
against England, Germany "will
quickly change her objective." This,
too, comprises no great revelation to
the average citizen. In fact, Adolf
noised it around yesterday that Ger
many wishes to avoid war with the
United States. And the audience of
13,000 that heard him speak clapped
loudest at this statement.

r JpHE thread of significance that
wound in and out of the Fueh
rer's 91-minute oration may lead to
a few interesting conclusions. It
seemed to show that Hitler believes
the war is in its last stages, that a
German victory is in the cards, and
that peace treaties will be signed
very soon. That would explain his
allusion to "last-minute" assistance
to England. And that assumption
would clarify his motives for not
wishing to irritate Mr. and Mrs. Av
erage American with too loud a pro
test against U.S. unneutrality.
Hitler walked lightly and po
litely yesterday, and glanced over
his shoulder to see how Washing
ton was taking it.

jyjEANWHILE, the United States
government's investigation of
the industrial "bottle-necks" that
have been hampering the flow of de
fense materials blossomed into a
written indictment against the Alu
minum Company of America. The
Federal Grand Jury charged that
the trust has combined with the
German Dye Trust and several
other concerns to create a situation
in which Germany has been getting
at least four times as much magne
sium a year as the United States.
If the charges introduced by the
Grand Jury arc true —and it seems
almost certain that they are—this
case will be probably the most im
portant one before the Department
of Justice in the last year. The
government has been preparing its
case against the six corporations
and nine individuals for some
time. It has all the aspects of a
gigantic "international expose"
that may reveal how German con
spiracy restricted U. S. output to
one producer.
The aircraft industry has had
great difficulty in securing adequate
supplies of magnesium, an essential
product. The delay can be traced to
a serious shortage of foundry facil
ities for the production of the metal.
According to the Department of
Justice, the price, too, has been
maintained at "artificially and un
reasonably high levels" in contrast
to the price quoted for the metal
abroad. And, at the same time, only
one magnesium producer has been
allowed to exist in the United
States.
If the jury can discover the com
plex financial and patent relations
that tie the American branch of the
industry to I. G. Farbenindustrie of
Germany, they will be taking an
additional step to speed production
of so necessary a commodity.
