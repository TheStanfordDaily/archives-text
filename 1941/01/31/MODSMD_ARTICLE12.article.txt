# Men Offer Cars to Dates For Hawkins Turnabout Hop
## 
### 
Farm Daisy Maes who find themselves without transportation for the
iSndie Hawkins Hop need not despair. An unofficial, but reliable poll
conducted yesterday by The Daily revealed that Stanford men will sur
render even their cars for a chance to attend the dance.
The chances are getting slimmer, however, according to Pat Adams,

chairman, who yesterday announced,
that more than 300 bids had passed
over the counter of the A.S.S.U.
office. In the last two days the
pasteboards have been going at the
rate of 100 per day.
Evidence that Stanford men are
still being efficiently, if somewhat
primitively, snagged is shown in an
exclusive photograph on this page.
This, however, is a' rare case. Not
all the Farm Li'l Abners are dis
playing Mr. Taylor's unseemly re
luctance.
New recruits for entertainment at
the dance were also announced yes
terday by Chairman Adams. Among
those who are lending their talents
for the occasion are Tommy How
ard, Barbara Moore, Mary Merner,
Gerry Hughes, Yvonne Hazlett, Ray
Stahl, Olga Widman, Hal Millen,
Judy Pope, and Patty Bouchard â€”
all luminaries who shone in the
last Gaieties. , j
Tickets to the dance are priced kit
$1.95 for "ladeez," plus 2 cents
"tacks for gents."
Stanfordites who attended the last
Hawkins frolic will remember tne
corncob pipes and blonde hair mops
sported by almost unrecognizable
Roughs. Many of the men went
whole hog and dressed as women
carrying out the "Backwards" as
pect of the occasion.
The Hop will be held in the wom
en's gym Friday, Feb. 7, from 9:30
to 1 o'clock.
