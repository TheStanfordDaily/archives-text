# Measle Epidemic Threatens Farm
## 
### 
Recalling the epidemic of Ger
man measles on the campus in 1935,
Dr. O. N. Anderson, medical ad
viser of men, yesterday warned
that there is now danger of a simi
lar epidemic. Since this disease is
extremely contagious, he urges
that any student who does not feel
well report to the Student Health
Service immediately.
Although the disease is not se
rious, it usually incapacitates the
student for 3 to 4 days. The symp
toms are a pink rash on the face
and chest with the sensation of
feverishness. This may be accompa
nied by a sore throat and a swelling
of the glands in the neck, according
to Dr. Anderson.
Yesterday Dr. Helen B. Pryor,
head of the Women's Health Serv
ice, discussed the disease and its
care with Women's Council.
