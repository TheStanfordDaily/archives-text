# Hunger Threat Rises in Europe
## Research Institute Reveals Conditions 
### CLAUDIA NETTLES 
Serious widespread hunger threat
ens, hut has not yet clearly emerged
in vulnerable sections of Axis
dominated Europe, according to the
Stanford Food Research Institute's
"World Wheat Survey" released to
day. Included in this area arc Po
land, Bohemia-Moravia, Slovakia,
Germany, Denmark, Norway, the
Low Countries, occupied and unoc
cupied France, and Italy.
These countries are suffering
from severe shortages of meat, fats,
milk and milk products, eggs, fish,
fruits, coffee, tea, and cocoa. Al
though the wheat supply in this area
will probably fulfill total food re
quirements, the Institute report
predicts an unfillable deficiency of
feed grains and other foodstuffs to
maintain even the reduced herds of
livestock and poultry flocks which
survived the recent German-or
dered stock slaughter.
If the German government should
attempt to distribute her war re
serves evenly among the total
population now under its rule, the
i Axis - controlled territory would
have a chance to evade hunger
problems during the current crop
year, according to the Food Re
search Survey. However, German
policy, transportation, and distribu
tion problems would present for
midable obstacles to such a task.
"Almost certainly the large Ger
man war reserves of grain will not
be sharply curtailed to feed the
civil populations of surrounding
countries," the report said, "and
without drafts upon these reserves
the potential food supplies of some
of these countries seem dangerously
I small."
Evidences of food deficiency are
most obvious in Belgium and Po
land which instituted stringent bread
rationing after surrender to Ger
many in order to postpone a near
shortage of bread grain supplies.
These countries limited per capita
bread purchases to approximately
two-fifths to two-thirds of the na
tional average in pre-war years.
The effect of the rations was to
