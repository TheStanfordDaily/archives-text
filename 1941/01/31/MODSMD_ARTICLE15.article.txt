# Hunger Threat Rises in Europe
## Research Institute Reveals Conditions 
### CLAUDIA NETTLES 
Serious widespread hunger threat
ens, hut has not yet clearly emerged
in vulnerable sections of Axis
dominated Europe, according to the
Stanford Food Research Institute's
"World Wheat Survey" released to
day. Included in this area arc Po
land, Bohemia-Moravia, Slovakia,
Germany, Denmark, Norway, the
Low Countries, occupied and unoc
cupied France, and Italy.
These countries are suffering
from severe shortages of meat, fats,
milk and milk products, eggs, fish,
fruits, coffee, tea, and cocoa. Al
though the wheat supply in this area
will probably fulfill total food re
quirements, the Institute report
predicts an unfillable deficiency of
feed grains and other foodstuffs to
maintain even the reduced herds of
livestock and poultry flocks which
survived the recent German-or
dered stock slaughter.
If the German government should
attempt to distribute her war re
serves evenly among the total
population now under its rule, the
i Axis - controlled territory would
have a chance to evade hunger
problems during the current crop
year, according to the Food Re
search Survey. However, German
policy, transportation, and distribu
tion problems would present for
midable obstacles to such a task.
"Almost certainly the large Ger
man war reserves of grain will not
be sharply curtailed to feed the
civil populations of surrounding
countries," the report said, "and
without drafts upon these reserves
the potential food supplies of some
of these countries seem dangerously
I small."
Evidences of food deficiency are
most obvious in Belgium and Po
land which instituted stringent bread
rationing after surrender to Ger
many in order to postpone a near
shortage of bread grain supplies.
These countries limited per capita
bread purchases to approximately
two-fifths to two-thirds of the na
tional average in pre-war years.
The effect of the rations was to
encourage substitution of potatoes
and coarser cereals for wheat and
rye, as well as to cut food con
sumption.
The German ration, on the other
hand, is reasonably liberal in view
of the present scarcity of various
other foods, which might be ex
pected to swell the demand for
bread. However, the Institute sur
vey states that it is reasonable to
suppose that members of "inferior"
races and persons of "unenlightened"
political views find it difficult to
secure adequate amounts of bread.
If the British continue their
blockade of overseas shipments to
any part of the Axis-dominated
area, except, perhaps, unoccupied
France, the Danube basin will be
come virtually the sole source of
wheat imports in this region, since
Russian exports cannot be depended
upon.
In all parts of the Danube basin
except Bulgaria, the Institute has
received reports that there is evi
dence, especially in cities, of un
usual shortages of wheat. Sporadic
bread shortages have been reported
in Belgrade and the Hungarian
Food Minister announced recently
that Hungary faces a serious wheat
shortage. Reports from Rumania
stress heavy substitution of corn for
wheat this year.
So far, the survey reports, hun
ger does not seem to have developed
on a large scale, but the threat re
mains.

Evidences of food deficiency are
most obvious in Belgium and Po
land which instituted stringent bread
rationing after surrender to Ger
many in order to postpone a near
shortage of bread grain supplies.
These countries limited per capita
bread purchases to approximately
two-fifths to two-thirds of the na

The effect of the rations was to
encourage substitution of potatoes
and coarser cereals for wheat and
rye, as well as to cut food con

The German ration, on the other

of the present scarcity of various
other foods, which might be ex

In all parts of the Danube basin
