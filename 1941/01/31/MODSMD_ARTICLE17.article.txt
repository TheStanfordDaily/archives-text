# Cagers Face Ucla Twice In Games at Westwood
## 
### 
Stanford's basketball team, twelve strong, started on a trip last night.
This isn't just a pleasure trip, for the Indians have an important mis
sion to fulfill when they reach their destination, I,os Angeles.
Going into tonight's fracas with a headlock on the conference lead
with three games w«;»n as against none lost, the Indians are definitely bat-

tling under pressure, for the Uclans«
would like nothing better than to
knock the Cards off their lofty nest
tonight or tomorrow night.
While the Bruins and Indians are
matching baskets in Westwood this
week-end, U.C.L.A.'s cross-town
rivals, the Trojans from U.S.C., will
be attempting to move out in front
of the California Bears in a pair of
conference games at Berkeley. The
Bears, Trojans, and Bruins are all
tied up in second spot in the con
ference standings, and these two
sets of games should clear up the
situation, unless, of course, each
team wins one game and loseg one.
BRUINS IMPROVE
Down at U.C.L.A., Coach Wilbur
Johns has molded a quintet which
appears to be the best to represent
the Westwood institution in the past
several years. Instead of having a
one-man basketball team in Jack
Robinson, as was the case last year,
the Bruins now have a club that
plays team ball, as was shown in
the U.C.L.A.-Cal series.
In Johnny Fryei\ a sophomore
sensation, Coach Johns has uncov
ered a Bruin center who can do
some scoring on his own hook. Fry
er was just what the Bruins needed
to have a good team, for. although
Jackie Robinson is just about the
best shot in the conference he
couldn't handle all the scoring
himself.
With their return to form in the
Santa Clara clash last Monday
night, Coach Everett Dean's charges
should lengthen their conference
lead tonight and tomorrow night
despite the improvement of the
Bruins. Everyone has known all
along that the Indians could really
play a classy brand of ball when
they were on their game, but even
in their victories over the Trojans
and Bears, they didn't play the game
they were capable of. However,
they did come out on top and, after
all, that's what counts.
CARDS ARE FAST
Smoothness is Stanford's strongest
point, but it is a quality that is
sometimes very hard to keep at a
peak. If the Indians have it tonight,
the Bruins are bound to have more
than a little trouble stopping them,
especially on those fast breaks that
find Don Williams, Fordy Anderson,
and Don Burness speeding down
court and handling the ball like a
trio of magicians.
Just who the Indian star or stars
will be this week-end nobody
knows. Some nights it's Kenny Dav
idson, on others it's Williams or
Burness. It's a hunch, but watch
for what Burness docs tonight. The
way he made the highly touted Jim
Rickert of Santa Clara look like he
was asleep at the post in the two
Bronc-Card games gives evidence
that the smooth Stanford center can
really give pointers on under-the
basket play.
Coach Dean took 12 players south,
including, besides the first team,
Johnny Alltucker, Bob Wensel,
Freddie Linari, Jack Dana, Ed Voss,
Dick Taylor, and Bob Penn.
The probable starting line-up:
STANFORD U.C.L.A.
Anderson F Robinson
Williams F L. Anderson
Burness C Fryer
Cowden G Null

Stanford's basketball team, twelve strong, started on a trip last night.
This isn't just a pleasure trip, for the Indians have an important mis
sion to fulfill when they reach their destination, I,os Angeles.
Going into tonight's fracas with a headlock on the conference lead
with three games w«;»n as against none lost, the Indians are definitely bat-

tling under pressure, for the Uclans«
would like nothing better than to
knock the Cards off their lofty nest
tonight or tomorrow night.
While the Bruins and Indians are
matching baskets in Westwood this
week-end, U.C.L.A.'s cross-town
rivals, the Trojans from U.S.C., will
be attempting to move out in front
of the California Bears in a pair of
conference games at Berkeley. The
Bears, Trojans, and Bruins are all
tied up in second spot in the con
ference standings, and these two
sets of games should clear up the
situation, unless, of course, each
team wins one game and loseg one.
BRUINS IMPROVE
Down at U.C.L.A., Coach Wilbur
Johns has molded a quintet which
appears to be the best to represent
the Westwood institution in the past
several years. Instead of having a
one-man basketball team in Jack
Robinson, as was the case last year,
the Bruins now have a club that
plays team ball, as was shown in
the U.C.L.A.-Cal series.
In Johnny Fryei\ a sophomore
sensation, Coach Johns has uncov
ered a Bruin center who can do
some scoring on his own hook. Fry
er was just what the Bruins needed
to have a good team, for. although
Jackie Robinson is just about the
best shot in the conference he
couldn't handle all the scoring
himself.
With their return to form in the
Santa Clara clash last Monday
night, Coach Everett Dean's charges
should lengthen their conference
lead tonight and tomorrow night
despite the improvement of the
Bruins. Everyone has known all
along that the Indians could really
play a classy brand of ball when
they were on their game, but even
in their victories over the Trojans
and Bears, they didn't play the game
they were capable of. However,
they did come out on top and, after
all, that's what counts.
CARDS ARE FAST
Smoothness is Stanford's strongest
point, but it is a quality that is
sometimes very hard to keep at a
peak. If the Indians have it tonight,
the Bruins are bound to have more
than a little trouble stopping them,
especially on those fast breaks that
find Don Williams, Fordy Anderson,
and Don Burness speeding down
court and handling the ball like a
trio of magicians.
Just who the Indian star or stars
will be this week-end nobody
knows. Some nights it's Kenny Dav
idson, on others it's Williams or
Burness. It's a hunch, but watch
for what Burness docs tonight. The
way he made the highly touted Jim
Rickert of Santa Clara look like he
was asleep at the post in the two
Bronc-Card games gives evidence
that the smooth Stanford center can
really give pointers on under-the
basket play.

Williams F L. Anderson
Burness C Fryer
Cowden G Null
