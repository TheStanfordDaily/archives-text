BERLIN, .fan. 30 (UP). —Adolf
Hitler said today that American help
for Britain "will be torpedoed," and
should the American people enter
the war, "Europe will defend it
self."
The Fuehrer, speaking to a cheer
ing throng of 20,000 in the Berlin
Sports Palace, declared that "Ger
many from the start has taken into
calculation the possibility of Amer
ican aid to Britain.
"Whoever believes they will be
able to help England," he said, "must
know that in any case every ship
with or without convoy that comes
to their help will be torpedoed."
Hitler declared that the combined
force of Germany's reinforced sub
marine fleet, her air force and un
precedented land divisions will
strike this spring "and force a de
cision one way or another."
He said the war will continue but
the past year and a half's fighting
"has practically" decided its out
come.
"The year 1941," he said, "will be
the historical year of a great new
order in Europe.
"When the hour comes," Hitler
declared, "we will strike decisively
and the gentlemen (of Britain) will
learn this year as an historical fact
that we have used our time well."
He said that the German people
had no issue against the American
people.
"Everybody knows this who does
not wish to falsify the facts," he
said. "Germany has never been
against American interests. It has
fought with them for the liberty of
their continent."
He promised that Germany would
spring great surprises upon its ene
mies and that Germany had fully
armed—to an extent which even the
people of Germany do not realize.
"We are in a war which we did
not want," he declaimed. "Our op
ponents will have their 'blue won
der' (colloquial German for 'big
surprise')."
Italy, he asserted, stands firmly at
Germany's side and hopes for revolt
in Italy or Germany because of Ital
ian setbacks are vain.
