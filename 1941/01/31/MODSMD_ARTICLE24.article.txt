WASHINGTON, Jan. 30 (UP). —
German Chancellor Adolf Hitler's

ers under the pending lend-lease
bill.
Sen. Claude Pepper, D., Fla., who
frequently speaks for the adminis
tration, described the threat "as
just the same old Hitler tech

"Once again," he said, "Hitler is
trying to divide the forces of
democracy by sowing the seeds of
suspicion."
