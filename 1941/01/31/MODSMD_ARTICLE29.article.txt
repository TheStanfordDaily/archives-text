# Men's Vocom Opens Monday
## 
### 
PettJ Whittlesey and Dick Meyer
hoff, presidents of Interfraternity
Council and Interclub Council, re
spectively, announced yesterday
that fraternity and club members
will be excused from Monday night
meetings in order to attend the Vo
cational Problems Series talks.
The first of these talks will take
place this Monday evening, when
Dean J. Hugh Jackson of the Grad
uate School of Eusiness speaks on
"A Career in Business." Dean Jack
son will be introduced by Bruce
Jessup, A.S.S.U. president, who
headed the Men's Vocational Com
mittee, sponsor of the series, last
year.
Chairman Frank Mallory of the
Vocom emphasized yesterday that
the talks will last only one hour—
from 7 to 8 o'clock—and therefore
will not interfere with evening
study schedules. The talks will be
held every Monday evening in the
Encina lobby.
The announcement that fraternity
and club members will be excused
from meetings in order to attend
the talks fitted in well with the
Committee's drive to interest stu
dents other than freshmen in the
talks. Although a large part of the
audience is naturally made up of
first-year men, Vocom is expecting
a large number of Row and Hall
men to attend.
