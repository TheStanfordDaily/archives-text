# Janice Schwensen Takes Star Honors in 'Excellent' Performance of 'St. Joan'
## Shaw Play Reflects Professional Caliber as Stanford Players Show Acting, Production Superiority 
### ROSE DOUGLASS 
A splendid performance of one of the meatiest tragedies of the modern
theater was awarded to the somewhat select audience who attended the
opening performance of Bernard Shaw's "Saint Joan" last night in Memo
rial Hall. »
The Stanford Players may congratulate themselves on another memor-

rable production this morning,<
judging by the excellence of the
first five scenes, which this reviewer
was able to enjoy before forced to
leave in order to make The Daily's
deadline.
The whole show lived up to the
advance promises of a production of
professional caliber, both in the
acting, the sensitive direction, and
the technical aspects. All the re
sources of the Stanford Theater
joined forces to turn out a finished
and beautifully modulated perform
ance of a brilliant and many-faceted
drama.
MASTERFUL PERFORMANCE
Janice Schwenson as Joan did a
masterful job in the title role. The
part is not one for an actress of
mediocre ability to undertake, and
Miss Schwenson displayed a talent
worthy of such an ambitious ve
hicle.
She played the maid with all the
vigor and fire that Shaw's charac
terization gives her—not the soulful
little martyr of school books, but a
hardy peasant girl with a head
strong determination, who does not
hesitate to tread on the toes of her
social betters.
TOUCH OF GLORY
Her magnificent voice and her
graceful vitality, and most of all her
fire and spirit gave Joan the touch
of glory that makes Shaw's heroine
a convincing and exciting charac
ter.
But the many other notable per
formances were not overshadowed
by that of Miss Schwenson. John
High played the Archbishop of
Rheims with subtlety and the right
touch of nastiness for the part of
"the old fox," Dave Regnery as
Dunois, the bastard of Orleans, im-:
parted the integrity of the battle
toughened soldier, who was Joan's
only real friend, with a sort of re
laxed vitality that made him like
able.
OTHER ACTORS GOOD
Of those scenes witnessed, the
third was outstanding. Here Ted
Marcuse, the unscrupulous War
wick, Charles Bulotti as the equivo
cal Bishop of Beauvais, and Frank
Burt as de Stogumber, the fanatical
English cleric, maintained a high
level of dramatic intensity, in a
scene that tends to be wordy, as the
political and ecclesiastical implica
ations of the case of of Joan d'Arc
are expounded.
Cadaverous Bud Cady as the
Dauphin wrenched a good many
laughs out of the audience, but his
down-East accent and broad char
acterization made it look like he
thought he was still playing in The
Gaieties."
