## JERRY BRUCKER, Sports Editor Frosh Cage Five to Face J. C. Outfit 
### 
Odds -on favorites because of their
victory over Santa Clara frosh
Monday nJifl*!. Stanford's frosh
hoopnicn tackle two clubs this
week-endâ€”Modesto J. C. tonight at
7:15 and San Jose high school to
morrow afternoon at 3, both games
to be played in the Pavilion.
Art Dittbemer's valley aggrega
tion put the skids under Cal's
yearlings Wednesday eve, 42-31,
which may shed some light on the
Modestans' all-around strength. Sig
Jaeobsen, captain and forward of
the Pirates, led the bucket parade
against the Bear cubs, tallying 14
points.
As for Saturday's encounter,
Coach Beeb Lee will probably get a
chance to use some of the boys who
have been warming the bench for
the better part of the season, as the
Card babes will have a great height
advantage and a far more experi
enced squad.
Tomorrow's game will be the last
one before Stanford's traditional
rivals from Berkeley invade the
Pavilion for the first of a three
game series on Feb. 7.
