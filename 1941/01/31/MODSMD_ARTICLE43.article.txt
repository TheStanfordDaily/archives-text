# Rugby Team To Battle U.S.F. Dons
## 
### 
Stanford's rugby squad will (an
gle with the U.S.F. fifteen Saturday
afternoon in what should prove to
be a comparatively easy tilt for the
Indians. Starting at 2:30 o'clock, the
game may be decided by the supe
rior condition of the Cards.
Stanford will probably start with
virtually the same line-up that de
feated the Olympic Club squad last
Saturday, with Morgan, Ugrin and
Barnard in the front rank, and
: Orme, Pierce, Demailly, arid Lyon
| in the second rank. Ned Pugh will
| start at his lock position.
The backfield will probably line
[up with Albert. Cole, Olden,
Thompson, JedenofT. Kmetovic, and
j Standlee in the starting posts. This
line-up is only tentative, however,
and may be changed by the coaches
before game time.
Slated to play against Menlo
Junior College in the closing game
j at 3:30, the Stanford Frosh are not
: ready for competition at this time
and the game will be played be
tween Menlo and the varsity re
| serves.
The games will probably be
' played on the new intramural field.
! due to the poor shape of the rugby
| field.
