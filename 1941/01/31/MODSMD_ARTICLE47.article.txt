## 
### 
With two victories under their collective belt. Stanford's varsity base
hidlers will attempt to make it three straight tomorrow afternoon when
they tangle with the Hank of America nine 011 the Sunken Diamond at
2:."50 o'clock.
Little is known on the Farm about the Bankers aggregation other

than the fact that they made a fairly
respectable showing for themselves
in the Winter League play in San
Francisco. It is known, however,
that their line-up will not be studded
with stars as were the rosters of the
squads that the Indians beat earlier
this week. According to Coach
Harry Wolter they are a good semi
pro team, nothing more.
Stanford will start the tilt with
either Claude Purkitt or "Cootie"
Thompson on the mound, with Ace
Hanlon handling * the backstop
chores. Ray Hammett will cover
first base and Harry Parsons will
hold down the keystone sack. With
Elton Boone on third base and
Monte Pfyl at shortstop, this looks
like the best infield that the Indians
can offer the visitors. Cereghino,
Falascio, and Graham will play out
field for the Cards.
The Indians have, shown up very
well in the two games that they
have won this year, and actually
looked like they might be approach
ing mid-season form in the last tilt.
With Thompson and Purkitt to han
dle the pitching, Stanford may go a
long way on the championship trail.
The team hitting seemed rather
weak at times last Thursday, the
boys failing several times to come
through when a hit. would have
meant a run or two.
