# Women's New Place
## 
### 
MRS. FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT, whom we
have always considered a liberal and
progressive woman, has become a renegade to
the cause of national unity, if remarks attributed
to her in recent news dispatches are any cri
terion.
Speaking on the subject of whether America's
young womanhood should be conscripted along
with the men, the First Lady allegedly asserted
that "at the present time it would be very un
wise to conscript women in the way in which
men have been conscripted."
It is truly unbelievable that women, granted
equality under the law by the Women's Suf
frage Act of 1919, would shirk this opportunity
to prove their equality. We confidently ex
pected America's young womanhood to rally
behind the men last October, and to a person
volunteer for conscription.
Here was their chance to show that the equal
ity granted them by suffrage was not just a
superficial one. But they muffed the opportunity
completely. So instead of going down in his
tory as irrepressible Amazons, defiant, coura
geous, willing to follow their men through all
vicissitudes, America's young women have
shown their true colors.
For those who doubt the widespread benefits
of womanhood conscription, let them muse over
the following points. Feminine conscription
would:
1. Contribute to the morale of the national
unity movement. With the women by their
sides, the men would realize that they had
something concrete to fight for. Besides, what
good are men without women, and vice versa?
2. Make much better soldiers. Brother, think
of all those knife thrusts you've taken in the
back, and consider how much nicer it would
be to have them directed at the enemy instead
of at yourself.
3. Would make better fighters because they
are so cold-blooded. If any person knows any
women who are not so, please direct such in
formation immediately to the undersigned.
4. Save the War Department money on cloth
ing materials and food. Inasmuch as it is doubt
ful whether the women would consent to wear
trousers, that much money would be saved.
It is a physiological fact that women eat less
than men—unless they are not paying for the
food—so some adjustment would have to be
made on their paychecks to guarantee that they
do not eat the government into bankruptcy.
5. Could distract the enemy by swirling their
skirts, thus putting our soldiers in a better posi
tion to exterminate them. The problem may
arise, of course, as to what quota of our own
soldiers will be distracted.
6. As far as Stanford is concerned, woman
hood conscription would solve the sorority
problem. No women, no sororities, no problem.
A cinch.
Of course, there are ramifications to the plan
that would need some ironing out. For instance,
there might be a slight tendency for too much
relaxation. But by careful psychological re
search some solution could possibly be effected.
Attention, you Freudians.—G. M.

IF in the period that lies just ahead of us tree
discussion is to continue, then universities
must not be compelled to abide by the dictates
of anyone, individual or group, that holds to
one point of view, old or new. They must be
free to seek the truth and to announce it as they
find it.
If this privilege does not continue to be ac
corded to universities, if the military, or a party,
or a chamber of commerce, or any other organi
zation can succeed in having its particular brand
of idea taught as the one to be accepted, we
shall then be under fascism . . .
For any authority to limit the teacher's ac
tivity in seeking and teaching the truth, because
of disagreement with him or because of fear of
the effect of teaching the truth, is nothing less
than authoritarianism. It is the antithesis of

democracy.
Nevertheless, the teacher must use discretion
in the manner he presents the truth. He must
not use his position as a crusading ground for
any pet idea. He must remember that his pro
fessional position demands special obligations
to the community.—President Raymond A. Kent,

MRS. FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT, whom we
have always considered a liberal and
progressive woman, has become a renegade to
the cause of national unity, if remarks attributed
to her in recent news dispatches are any cri
terion.
Speaking on the subject of whether America's
young womanhood should be conscripted along
with the men, the First Lady allegedly asserted
that "at the present time it would be very un
wise to conscript women in the way in which
men have been conscripted."
It is truly unbelievable that women, granted
equality under the law by the Women's Suf
frage Act of 1919, would shirk this opportunity
to prove their equality. We confidently ex
pected America's young womanhood to rally
behind the men last October, and to a person
volunteer for conscription.
Here was their chance to show that the equal
ity granted them by suffrage was not just a
superficial one. But they muffed the opportunity
completely. So instead of going down in his
tory as irrepressible Amazons, defiant, coura
geous, willing to follow their men through all
vicissitudes, America's young women have
shown their true colors.
For those who doubt the widespread benefits
of womanhood conscription, let them muse over
the following points. Feminine conscription
would:
1. Contribute to the morale of the national
unity movement. With the women by their
sides, the men would realize that they had
something concrete to fight for. Besides, what
good are men without women, and vice versa?
2. Make much better soldiers. Brother, think
of all those knife thrusts you've taken in the
back, and consider how much nicer it would
be to have them directed at the enemy instead
of at yourself.
3. Would make better fighters because they
are so cold-blooded. If any person knows any
women who are not so, please direct such in
formation immediately to the undersigned.
4. Save the War Department money on cloth
ing materials and food. Inasmuch as it is doubt
ful whether the women would consent to wear
trousers, that much money would be saved.
It is a physiological fact that women eat less
than men—unless they are not paying for the
food—so some adjustment would have to be
made on their paychecks to guarantee that they
do not eat the government into bankruptcy.
5. Could distract the enemy by swirling their
skirts, thus putting our soldiers in a better posi
tion to exterminate them. The problem may
arise, of course, as to what quota of our own
soldiers will be distracted.
6. As far as Stanford is concerned, woman
hood conscription would solve the sorority
problem. No women, no sororities, no problem.
A cinch.
Of course, there are ramifications to the plan
that would need some ironing out. For instance,
there might be a slight tendency for too much
relaxation. But by careful psychological re
search some solution could possibly be effected.

IF in the period that lies just ahead of us tree

democracy.
Nevertheless, the teacher must use discretion
in the manner he presents the truth. He must
not use his position as a crusading ground for
any pet idea. He must remember that his pro
fessional position demands special obligations

MRS. FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT, whom we
have always considered a liberal and
progressive woman, has become a renegade to
the cause of national unity, if remarks attributed
to her in recent news dispatches are any cri
terion.
Speaking on the subject of whether America's
young womanhood should be conscripted along
with the men, the First Lady allegedly asserted
that "at the present time it would be very un
wise to conscript women in the way in which
men have been conscripted."
It is truly unbelievable that women, granted
equality under the law by the Women's Suf
frage Act of 1919, would shirk this opportunity
to prove their equality. We confidently ex
pected America's young womanhood to rally
behind the men last October, and to a person
volunteer for conscription.
Here was their chance to show that the equal
ity granted them by suffrage was not just a
superficial one. But they muffed the opportunity
completely. So instead of going down in his
tory as irrepressible Amazons, defiant, coura
geous, willing to follow their men through all
vicissitudes, America's young women have
shown their true colors.
For those who doubt the widespread benefits
of womanhood conscription, let them muse over
the following points. Feminine conscription
would:
1. Contribute to the morale of the national
unity movement. With the women by their
sides, the men would realize that they had
something concrete to fight for. Besides, what
good are men without women, and vice versa?
2. Make much better soldiers. Brother, think
of all those knife thrusts you've taken in the
back, and consider how much nicer it would
be to have them directed at the enemy instead
of at yourself.
3. Would make better fighters because they
are so cold-blooded. If any person knows any
women who are not so, please direct such in
formation immediately to the undersigned.
4. Save the War Department money on cloth
ing materials and food. Inasmuch as it is doubt
ful whether the women would consent to wear
trousers, that much money would be saved.
It is a physiological fact that women eat less
than men—unless they are not paying for the
food—so some adjustment would have to be
made on their paychecks to guarantee that they
do not eat the government into bankruptcy.
5. Could distract the enemy by swirling their
skirts, thus putting our soldiers in a better posi
tion to exterminate them. The problem may
arise, of course, as to what quota of our own
soldiers will be distracted.
6. As far as Stanford is concerned, woman
hood conscription would solve the sorority
problem. No women, no sororities, no problem.
A cinch.
Of course, there are ramifications to the plan
that would need some ironing out. For instance,
there might be a slight tendency for too much
relaxation. But by careful psychological re
search some solution could possibly be effected.

IF in the period that lies just ahead of us tree
discussion is to continue, then universities
must not be compelled to abide by the dictates
of anyone, individual or group, that holds to
one point of view, old or new. They must be
free to seek the truth and to announce it as they
find it.
If this privilege does not continue to be ac
corded to universities, if the military, or a party,
or a chamber of commerce, or any other organi
zation can succeed in having its particular brand
of idea taught as the one to be accepted, we
shall then be under fascism . . .
For any authority to limit the teacher's ac
tivity in seeking and teaching the truth, because
of disagreement with him or because of fear of
the effect of teaching the truth, is nothing less
