# BULL SESSION
## RURAL FARM DELIVERY 
### BUD AMES 
JJERE is a natural for one of those Robert Benchley
short movies which cover every phase of everyday
triteness from reading in bed to filling out an income
tax report.
This one goes under the rather obvious title of
"Stanford Post Office at Noon." The time is yester
day just before the 11 o'clock classes are out; the
scene; the front of the post office. The "character"—
you.
As the scene opens, several rustic looking S.A.E.'s
appear through their front door. They blink at the
unexpected sun, practice up on a' few nasty and
meaningful whistles (the marines-are-in-town type)
and then settle down on the front steps to await the
carnage.
A few early comers, wiping flecks of coke from
their lips, float out of the Cellar, waddle up to the
post office. They go inside, appear with their letters
which they leave unopened. After all, they must look
nonchalant when the mob gets out of 11 o'clocks.

r PHE chimes begin. Everyone glances self-consciously
at a wrist watch, and then squints up toward the
Quad.
The rush starts. First up the street is a dark look
ing student in a two-day beard and faded blue jeans.
He glances down at the pile of Saturday Evening
Posts on the box by the door, and thinks how easy
it would be just to pick one up and forget to leave
the nickel. But the other men on the steps had 'the
same idea, and they are watching him. So he smiles
sheepishly, says something about the "patriotic cover,"
and then stumbles over the step on his way into the
hiding darkness.
Already the S.A.E.'s are whistling. Oh, boy, a
blonde and a brunette together. More and more, and
more students. A bewildered professor long contem
plates the chances of getting into the post office—
through all that mob—to buy three three's and a penny
postcard.
"Hy, Sylvia, what ya' know?"
"Oh, not much, Bruce, how's it going with you?"
"Well, don't work too hard."
Another whistle from across the street. A short
man in a shiny black Buick convertible roars up to
the road, shoves in the clutch and guns his motor.
He double parks, and everybody—simply everybody—
is looking at him.

HPHE black man opens his letter, and begins to look
nonchalant. Cigarettes everywhere. Smoking is the
thing. A sweater with a girl appears from out of the
post office darkness. She rips open the letter, looks
at the affectionate signature on the last page. She
smiles, and goes on reading, down the steps. She
walks squarely into two men who had seen her coming
all the time—and then just floats back to Roble.
Another girl is shaking a letter vigorously. Noth
ing falls out. Then she blows out the envelope, peers
inside, then crumbles it.
The Phi Delts come home in their rattles.
The man in the shiny black car leaves with a car
load of mixed women. Traffic begins to move again.
The S.A.E.'s have tired and puckered lips, so they
give up their useless whistling.
More people tromp up, somebody filches a Satur
day Evening Post, and the melee begins all over again.
And your mailbox was empty.
