# CAMPUS OPINION
## GO GETTUM ROBLE!

r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
There seems to be around this campus a sorry
lot of gloomy faced men who on a closer look can be
recognized as a bunch of Encina wall flowersâ€”at least
they are wall flowers to date so far as the Sadie
Hawkins dance goes. Come. Come now! We dated,
wined, and Dinahed you! How about giving us the
break of saving us from disillusionment and just give
us a hint about the seventh. You'll find that the En
cina males won't be as elusive as those of Dogpateh.
Dateless
