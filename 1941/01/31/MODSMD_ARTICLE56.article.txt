# THE 						FLYING TRAPEZE
## 
### 
r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
This is about Mr. Saroyan. He is a movie critic.
He is a "Daily" movie critic. That is to say, he is only
another literary miscarriage, a mental afterbirth. Soon
he will be writing Bull Session. He is sure to be
editor.
Mr. Saroyan liked neither ''Hudson's Bay" nor Paul
Muni. He prefers Lagunita and Paulette Goddard.
Muni, Saroyan says, is "mechanical, jerky." Paulette
is not described.
Muni is a good actor. He was good in "Hudson's
Bay." No French-Canadian was ever more French-
Canadian than Paul Muni. His acting transforms a
mediocrity into excellence. However, Mr. Saroyan
says that he was unnatural, that his mind was on the
Academy Award. The question now arises, where was
Mr. Saroyan's mind? On Goddard? On Lagunita? On
Head-copy-reader? Let's send a Johnny Walker label
to the Daily and find out.
Mr. Saroyan also disliked the film's leading lady.
He says she doesn't brush her teeth. Paulette Goddard
docs.
Mr. Saroyan is in some way related to The Man on
the Flying Trapeze. He does not take after him, how
ever. His talents lie in other fields. Hod-carrying or
the Daily, I think.

This is about Mr. Saroyan. He is not a movie
critic. He is not a Daily movie critic. That is to
say that he is just a guy that goes to school and
when asked to write reviews of movies, writes
them. He will never he writing Bull Session. lie
is almost certain never to he editor.
Mr. Saroyan liked neither Hudson's Hay nor
Paul Muni. He docs like Paulette Goddard very
much, hut has never heen in Lagunita. so he can't
say. It is prohahly a nice place to live.
Mr. Muni is not a good actor. He was not good
in "Hudson's Bay." He was mechanical and jerky.
His mind seemed to he on the Academy Award.
Mr. Saroyan's mind was not on Lagunita or on
Paulette although he thinks of her often.*
Mr. Saroyan disliked the leading lady. There
seemed to be something wrong with her face. He's
not sure whether the leading lady brushes her
teeth or not but he knows there is something wrong
with her face, lie is also uncertain about Paulette
and her brushing.
Mr. Saroyan is In some way related to the
Man on the Flying Trapeze. He does not take after
him: his talents may lie in other fields, hut since
he doesn't know what a hod is. max he it's The
Daily.â€”Sarox an.
