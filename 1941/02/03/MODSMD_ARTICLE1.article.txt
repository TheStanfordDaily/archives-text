### BOB LOW 
JT LOOKS like Henry Ford, the
little billionaire who loves sym
phony and hates organized labor, is
going to take what he gets from la
bor and grimace politely when he
takes it. At least, the latest com
munique from the labor front would
make it appear that two of the Ford
plants are going union—and soon.
For yesterday, A.F.L. President
William Green announced that a
majority of the 60,000 workers in the
great Lincoln and River Rouge
plants have been enrolled in two
new chartered federal unions.
Ford's light to keep his beloved
"family" away from the crass re
lationships engendered by such
organization has been hitter; but
the battle between the A.F.L. and
C.1.0. for control of the sprawl
ing lllivver empire has been even
more slam-bang.
Washington labor experts, after
hearing the A.F.L. announcement,
judged that the C.1.0. would not give
up the Lincoln and River Rouge
plums without a fight, and added
that the showdown might come
through an election supervised by
the National Labor Relations Board.

£N ANY event, it is clear that Ford
is going to get a union shop. The
handwriting on the walls of his ivory
tower made that plain enough last
Thursday when he was denied a
War Department defense contract
because of his refusal to accept a
stipulation requiring him to observe
all federal labor laws.
A liberal government, stepping
up defense production in a des
perate effort to get itself at full
defense strength as well as to
supply all possible aid to Great
Britain, is not going to tolerate any
nonsense from capricious manu
facturers. Nor is it going to stand
for hot jurisdictional labor dis
putes.
In what apparently was an effort
to sooth the troubled manufacturer,
President Green tossed him the fol
lowing well-oiled crumbs:
# * *
of members of the
A.F.L. unions have been em
ployed by the Ford Motor Company
inside its plants ever since it was
established. None of these employ
ees was ever discriminated against
by the management because of union
membership."
He went on to hope that "a col
lective bargaining and co-operative
relationhip which has always existed
between A.F.L. unions in Ford
plants and the management" will be
established between th" manage
ment and the newly chartered fed
eral unions.
However, the A.F.L. added a
little grit to Green's silky state
ments. For, while he was talking
about cosy amity, certain persons
designated as "other A.F.L.
sources" announced that the Fed
eration is prepared to ask the
Labor Board for an election if the
Ford Motor Company does not
recognize the new unions as bar
gaining agents of a majority of
the workers.
The Ford Company is the only
party specifically mentioned, but it
is clear that the A.F.L. isn't afraid
of the results of any election in the
Lincoln and River Rouge plants.
And Mr. Ford and the Congress of
Industrial Organizations can both go
climb a tree.
C.1.0.-A.F.L. dog-fights aside, it
is the Knight of the Cheap Auto
who is the "pathetic figure" in the
case. He is the man who can't win.
For years he has planted flower
gardens and promoted choral groups
among his employees, possibly as a
deterrent to any dreams of union
ization burgeoning in their collective
breasts.
However, Mr. Ford, the man who
blithely promised the nation 1000
military airplanes a day (a figure
his son Edsel later jacked up to
5000), cannot go on losing defense
contracts. He has his reputation to
think of.
