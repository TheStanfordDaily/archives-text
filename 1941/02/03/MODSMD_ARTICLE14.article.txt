# Paid Moore Trails Field in Mile Event
## 
### 
Paul Moore, mile sensation at
Stanford last year, finished a poor
last in the Wanamaker mile at the
Millrose Games Saturday.
Paul, world's record holder at the
three-quarters mile, was obviously
out of condition and finished far
behind his Eastern rivals, Walter
Mehl and John Munski.
