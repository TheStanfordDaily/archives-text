# Vichy Emissary Leaves For Paris to Consider Reinstatement of Laval
## Lend-Lease Bill Debate Begins Today in House 
### 
VICHY, Mon, Feb. .3 (UP).â€”Tho
seven weeks old crisis in French
and German relations neared its
climax early today when Admiral
France's Darlan, chief confidant of
Marshal Henri Philippe Petaln, left
for Paris aboard a special train for
a showdown on Adolf Hitler's "col
laboration" demands.
Hitler's foremost demand, upon
which Paris Nazis say there can be
no compromise, is for the restora
tion to power of pro-German Pierre
Laval.
In Paris, it was said, Darlan will
receive a German note formally
setting forth Hitler's demands.
DEADLOCK REACHED
(The German official news agency
DNB in a Geneva dispatch said Ad
miral Darlan was seeking to "ini
tiate conversations" in Paris but
that Paris quarters "consider the
time for conversations to be inop
portune so long as Vichy has not yet
gained clear recognition of the pres
ent situation."
(This appeared to indicate that
unless Admiral Darlan, as emissary
of Petain, was prepared to submit
fully to Hitler's demands the dead
lock in French - German relations
could not be broken.)
CRISIS NEAR
With Darlan's departure from
Vichy at 12:58 a.m. the dangerous
crisis in French-German relations
reached its climax, with a move one
way or another anticipated in 24
hours.
France's future now hangs upon
Marshal Petain's answer to Hitler's
firm insistence that Petain reinstate
Laval, ousted from his post as vice
prcmier and foreign minister by the
84-year-old marshal on Dec. 14 and
temporarily held under arrest.
Darlan's trip, it was said, is ex
pected definitely to settled Laval's
status which the Germans, with the
backing of the Nazi-dominated Paris
press, insist is the fundamental con
dition for resumption of French-
German collaboration.
