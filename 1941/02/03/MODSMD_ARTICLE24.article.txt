# DISCUSSION ON BRITISH AID BILL STARTS TODAY
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 2 (UP).—
The House begins debate on the
Administration's British aid bill—
one of the most historic issues be
fore Congress in a quarter of a
century — and the Democratic
leadership predicted that the
measure would pass by a 2 to I
majority this week.
A segment, of Republican House
members has vowed to go all out
in its opposition to the pending
measure. This group plans to
counter with a seven-point British
aid legislative program calling for a
drastic curb on the chief executive's
powers and proposing a grant to
the British government of $2,000,-
000,000 in credits for purchase of
armaments here.
Chairman Sol Bloom of the House
Foreign Affairs Committee, which
approved the Administration meas
ure with four minor changes last
week, said he would fight to the
limit any attempt to "put anything
into the bill that will destroy it."
House Republican Leader Joseph
Martin, Jr., said after a meeting of
the GOP membership last week that
"a great many Republicans are vot
ing against the bill" unless some
amendments are added to restrict
the President's powers. He favored
a $2,000,000,000 loan to Britain.
