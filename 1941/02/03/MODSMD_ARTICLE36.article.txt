# Flyers Acquire New Cub Plane
## Club Teams to Vie For Cal Competition 
### 
Stanford's rapidly growing flying
club has a new possessionâ€”a Piper
Cub airplane available exclusively
to club members. Use of the ship
begins today, according to Helen
Ford, flying club secretary.
Rights to the plane were an
nounced at a meeting of the organi
zation held late last week. A new
and faster plane, the Interstate
Cadet, soon will be made available
to members in place of the Cub.
At the meeting, presided over by
President Charles Wheeler, 15 new
members were present, bringing the
total enrollment to 32. Charles
Sharp, who holds both instructor
and instrument ratings, was selected
as the club's new vice-president.
Three club members, Wheeler,
Sharp, and Dick Williams, were ap
pointed captains of flying teams,
which will compete against each
other. From these three groups, a
top team will be chosen to compete
against California near the end of
February. Meets with Stockton,
Fresno, and San Jose will" be sched
uled later.
Authorities on aviation will speak
at future meetings. The general
public as well as members are in
vited to attend the meetings, which
will be held every Wednesday at the
airport at 7:30 o'clock.
