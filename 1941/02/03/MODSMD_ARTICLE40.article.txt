W/EEKLY letter to the Ii.A.C.
fT Fellas:
I\o\v that the affair Ellington has
blown over, things down your way
must be pretty cjuiet, so here are a
couple of things to keep you occu
pied.
The first deals with basketball.
Due to the limited capacity of
the gym, whenever the varsity is
playing anyone important it is
absolutely necessary for the spec
tators to show ur> early in order to
get a seat, r lhus, whether they
want to or not. they must witness
the freshman game.
Saturday the frosh defeated an
undefeated Santa Clara quint. And,
as far as we could ascertain, the
numbers on the program for the
Papoose squad had absolutely no
relation to the numbers they wore
cm their uniforms.
That was probably just a slip-up,
and partially excusable as such. But
more aggravating is the fact that
the numbers of the team that op
poses the frosh are never listed on
lhe program. Many times these
teams boast prep stars of major
proportions, yet their work must
remain anonymous to the paying
customers.
So do you think maybe it would
he possible to add to the programs
the names and numbers of the
boys the frosh play?

A LSO, would it be possible to re
lease some sort of a practice
game tentative schedule of the
corning activities of the baseball
team.
Of course, rain and bad weather
make any schedule for this sport
subject to change, but if we had a
tentative schedule of games it would
be much easier to give the ball team
the publicity it deserves.
East Wednesday Sam Chapman,
star Philadelphia Athletic out
fielder, played on the Sunken
Diamcnd, yet only about a score
cf spectators were on hand.
Other major leaguers will play
here in the next few weeks, but
unless baseball fans are given suf
ficient notice of when the games are
to be played, the crowds will be just
as small as yesterday's.

J~£EGINS to look as though the
boys might have something out
there on the rugby field.
After what must have been a dis
appointing opener against the Uni
versity Club, the squad got rolling I
last Saturday and slaughtered a j
highly rated Olympic Club fifteen, j
Sparked by Frankie Albert and |
Pi te Kmetovic, the ruggers looked
very impressive.
Before getting too high on the
squad, however, it must be admitted
lh;;t ihe Clubmen had some excuses.
An outfit of that type doesn't have
much time for practice, and what
ever conditioning they do is done by
the players on their own hook.
So, naturally, they tired in the
second half Saturday. They needed
a "tightener," just as thoroughbreds
need a couple of races to get in
top shape after a lay-off.
But just the same, it looks as
though Jim Wylie and Harry Ma
loney have the makings of a good
club on hand.
:J» * $
WfE made a mistake department.
Recently, Slants, discussing the
prospects of Harry Wolter's base
ball proteges, stated that Thor Pet
erson would not be with the squad
this year.
Tuesday, when Ihe Indians opened
the season against the Gaddini All-
Stars, Peterson started in center
field.
So we're wrong.
