The inevitable finally caught up with Stanford's high-flying basket
ball team down in Los Angeles over the week-end. For, after coming from
behind in Friday night's game with a blistering finish to beat U.CL,A.'s
Bruins 54-44, Coach Everett Dean's cagcrs failed to repeat on Saturday
and dropped a heartbreaker 45-44.
Rare enough are undefeated football seasons, as the Farm is still well
aware of, but an undefeated basketball team comes one-in-a-million.

After all. those tricky Indians
couldn't keep on winning forever.

After the Bronco tilt came three
days of intcn.-ive practice for the be
leaguered Indians, a bumpy, 10-hour
train ride to Los Angeles, and then
those two tough games with U.C.LA.
which resulted in the first Stanford
defeat since the Indiana game back
on December 21.
But despite the disaster of the past
week-end, Mr. Dean's fire-ball cage
team still leads the Pacific Coast
Conference's Southern Division, has
won 14 out of its iG ball games (the
two losses each being Ly one point
only), and was recently ranked the
number one basketball team in the
country by a nationwide newspaper
poll.

Getting back to those two games
in the southland, the Indians met a

Though they were trailing by four
points with 1!) minutes to go on
Friday, the Cards, sparked by the
return to form of Fordy "Cheeks"
Anderson and the ever deadly eye
oi Don Williams, came surging back
to win their ball game going away.
Saturday the Indians started out
in much the same fashion, coasting
along some four to six points behind
Lhe Bruins. But hampered by the
loss of their key man, Don Burness,
who was forced from the game with
Four personal fouls in the first half,
the Indians weren't able to make
:heir finishing bid strong enough to

Saturday the Indians started out
in much the same fashion, coasting
along some four to six points behind
Lhe Bruins. But hampered by the
loss of their key man, Don Burness,
who was forced from the game with
Four personal fouls in the first half,
the Indians weren't able to make
:heir finishing bid strong enough to
:atch the inspired southerners.
California has received nearly 11
per cent of the nation's defense con
tacts awarded to date.
The inevitable finally caught up with Stanford's high-flying basket
ball team down in Los Angeles over the week-end. For, after coming from
behind in Friday night's game with a blistering finish to beat U.CL,A.'s
Bruins 54-44, Coach Everett Dean's cagcrs failed to repeat on Saturday
and dropped a heartbreaker 45-44.
Rare enough are undefeated football seasons, as the Farm is still well
aware of, but an undefeated basketball team comes one-in-a-million.

After all. those tricky Indians
couldn't keep on winning forever.
STILL CHAMPS
After the Bronco tilt came three
days of intcn.-ive practice for the be
leaguered Indians, a bumpy, 10-hour
train ride to Los Angeles, and then
those two tough games with U.C.LA.
which resulted in the first Stanford
defeat since the Indiana game back
on December 21.
But despite the disaster of the past
week-end, Mr. Dean's fire-ball cage
team still leads the Pacific Coast
Conference's Southern Division, has
won 14 out of its iG ball games (the
two losses each being Ly one point
only), and was recently ranked the
number one basketball team in the
country by a nationwide newspaper
poll.
BRUINS IMPROVE
Getting back to those two games
in the southland, the Indians met a
vastly improved Bruin quintet.
Though they were trailing by four
points with 1!) minutes to go on
Friday, the Cards, sparked by the
return to form of Fordy "Cheeks"
Anderson and the ever deadly eye
oi Don Williams, came surging back
to win their ball game going away.
