## 
### 
iakmg a pair < ver the week-end,
the Indian frosh hoopmc n shaded
| Modesto J. C. Friday eve, 29-27, and
shellacked San Jose State high
j school Saturday afternoon, 33-19.
Friday's encounter almost equaled
the Santa Clara thriller of a week
j 3go, the ye.irlings winning on Bob
j Wreisner's tip-in a split second be
| fore the gun sounded.
Modesto Coach Art Dittberner put
a team on the floor that spanked the
frosh around and led at the half
time, 13-8. But for the third time
| in three games the '44 boys came
J back strong in the second half after
! a paltry 7 points in the first stanza,
j Every man on the team found his
j shooting eye, and the buckets came
! thick and fast.
Bill Hooper nabbed high-scoring
honors with ten tallies, nine of them
coming in the last half. Wireisner
l made but one basket the whole eve
j ning, but it was enough to win the
game.
Saturday, San Jose was no match
j for the Papoose five. Every man on
j Coach Beeb Lee's outfit got into the
scorebook. Frank McCann scored
| 10 points, the highest total yet made
| this season by anyone oh (lie squad.
Next Friday will find California's
frosh coming down for the first of a
three-game series.
