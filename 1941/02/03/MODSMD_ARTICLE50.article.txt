# Varsity Ruggers Down U.S.F., 8-0
## 
### 
Led by an aroused Pete Kmetovic
who did everything but referee the
game, the Stanford varsity ruggers
were able to down a tough U.S.F.
squad to the tune of 8-0 last Satur
day afternoon.
Kmetovic took it upon himself to
go on a scoring spree and person
ally accounted lor every Stanford
tally. Pete broke a deadlock that
lasted all through the first half with
a 25-yard run that climaxed a bril
liant passing rush by Roger Laverty
and A1 Wool and then made the
conversion. A few minutes later he
added a 20-yard penalty kick to
close the scoring for afternoon.
U.S.F. threatened only once in the
game when Kynock and Portello
staged a downfield passing rush that
came near the Stanford goal line
when it was finally stopped by a
fumble.
In a tilt that followed the varsity
contest the Reserves were held to a
0-0 tie by Menlo Junior College. The
Reserves hammered at the Menlo
goal-line all the way through the
second half and ended the game with
the ball on the two-yard line, but
were unable to break the ice.
