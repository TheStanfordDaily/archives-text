# No Athletes Needed
## 
### 
HOUSE and Hall presidents will be checking
over their lists of "eligibles" tonight and
trying to arouse a little hubba-hubba spirit to
get petitions signed and dropped in the box on
Law Steps.
It's a tough job, because winter election is
never too animaied. It arrives suddenly and is
greeted with apathy. In general, the number
and importance of positions justify no excep
tional display of energy in going to the polls.
Candidates will be nominated and the thirteen
available jobs will be filled adequately.
One of those jobs, however, requires an extra
ounce of consideration窶馬ow, before the nomi
nations are made.
The position is that of student member on the
Board of Athletic Control. A rapid analysis of
the qualifications for the spot would indicate
that an athlete be nominated. He would logi
cally be supposed to understand B.A.C. prob
lebs better than the average non-athlete.
So far the reasoning is sound. While the ath
lete may know well enough the reactions of his
team-mates to Board policies, he is, three-fourths
of the time, a physical education major. If not a
major, he often does much work in the depart
ment. As such he is dependent upon recom
mendation from his department in seeking a
coaching or teaching job after graduation. With
his future in mind, he is naturally hesitant about
opposing any action proposed by faculty or
alumni or administrative members of the Board.
Sometimes the athlete is on a scholarship
from an alumni group, one of whose most promi
nent members may be on the Board. Under
these circumstances it is impossible for the
student to be completely free in his expression
of opinion.
It would be absurd, of course, to infer that
any member of the Board indulges in actual
coercion to influence student members. Such
is not the case. But, try as he may, the Stanford
man or woman who votes next week cannot
overlook the fact that an un-stated, implied co
ercion exists if an athlete is named to the B.A.C.
That athlete is not free to speak in behalf of
Stanford students. And if student representa
tion on the B.A.C. is to be maintained, it is im
perative that non-athletes and non-physical
education majors be selected. Undergraduates'
interests can best be served on the Board by
an average Stanford man, unhampered by
strings of any type, whose reaction is that of a
typical student, and who is not afraid to do a
little walking on a few toes.

and importance of positions justify no excep
tional display of energy in going to the polls.
Candidates will be nominated and the thirteen
available jobs will be filled adequately.
One of those jobs, however, requires an extra
ounce of consideration窶馬ow, before the nomi
nations are made.
The position is that of student member on the
Board of Athletic Control. A rapid analysis of
the qualifications for the spot would indicate
that an athlete be nominated. He would logi
cally be supposed to understand B.A.C. prob
lebs better than the average non-athlete.
So far the reasoning is sound. While the ath
lete may know well enough the reactions of his
team-mates to Board policies, he is, three-fourths
of the time, a physical education major. If not a
major, he often does much work in the depart
ment. As such he is dependent upon recom
mendation from his department in seeking a
coaching or teaching job after graduation. With
his future in mind, he is naturally hesitant about
opposing any action proposed by faculty or
alumni or administrative members of the Board.
Sometimes the athlete is on a scholarship
from an alumni group, one of whose most promi
nent members may be on the Board. Under
these circumstances it is impossible for the
student to be completely free in his expression
of opinion.
It would be absurd, of course, to infer that
any member of the Board indulges in actual
coercion to influence student members. Such
is not the case. But, try as he may, the Stanford
man or woman who votes next week cannot
overlook the fact that an un-stated, implied co
ercion exists if an athlete is named to the B.A.C.
That athlete is not free to speak in behalf of
Stanford students. And if student representa
tion on the B.A.C. is to be maintained, it is im
perative that non-athletes and non-physical
education majors be selected. Undergraduates'
interests can best be served on the Board by
an average Stanford man, unhampered by
strings of any type, whose reaction is that of a
typical student, and who is not afraid to do a
little walking on a few toes.
HOUSE and Hall presidents will be checking
over their lists of "eligibles" tonight and
trying to arouse a little hubba-hubba spirit to
get petitions signed and dropped in the box on
Law Steps.
It's a tough job, because winter election is
never too animaied. It arrives suddenly and is
greeted with apathy. In general, the number
and importance of positions justify no excep
tional display of energy in going to the polls.
