# Spring Song
## 
### 
STANFORD'S male population, at least one
quarter of it, is whistling a merry spring
tune these days. The restless breeze, stealing
wistfully across the hills, leaving behind it a
veil of new green foliage, is a psalm, a rhap
sody, a joyous trumpet of gaiety and light
headedness.
It isn't the normal spring feeling that pervades
these Stanford men. The normal spring reac
tion would be to intensify their afternoon travels
down the highway in search of the lucid liquid
brew that symbolizes camaraderie and good
fellowship.
But as the week grows toward its close, and
the Sadie Hawkins Hop approaches reality, this
one-quarter of Stanford's male students, the
500 who have been invited to the Hop, will be
living in the clouds.
For they will have "arrived" socially. They
will have beaten the old quota racket. The 500
women who will have bought tickets to the Hop
will have chosen them as the "men of their
desire" (anyway, until the next thing comes
along).
Of course, if Cardinals (sponsor of the Hop)
really wanted to play fair, they might have
made a few changes in the dance. For instance,
only 500 men will be among the elite come
Friday night. Undoubtedly there were many
women who flipped coins trying to decide
whom to ask. Others may have decided not to
go at all, not knowing which of their many
escorts to invite.
This constitutes a depressing problem for
the majority of the Farm's men and women. The
whole thing still falls a trifle short of faultless
democracy.
If Cardinals had really Wanted to insure
Jeremy Bentham's philosophy of "the greatest
good for the greatest number," they would have
made it obligatory for the women to invite two
or more men. They could change the name of
the dance to "One Night in an Amazon's
Harem."
Think of the publicity the dance would get.

Why, it would be a natural. Every news maga
zine, picture periodical, paper in the country
would carry accounts of it.
Of course, a minor dilemma might be pre
sented after the dance was over. It would be
quite a problem deciding who was to escort the
girl to the door. But Stanford's women have in
genious methods of escaping from such di
lemmas. It would be worked out some way, no
doubt.
However, as things stand now, some Stanford
men are whistling their gay little tunes dedi
cated to the altar of spring. And many is the
Stanford man who will return to his abode early
Saturday morning, look into his unsullied wal
let, and wonder if such things can actually be
true. â€”G. M.
