AS YE SOW . . .
IT WOULDN'T take much checking back on your
part to discover that sales for last year's Sadie
Hawkins Dance did exactly the opposite of what they
are doing this year.
That is, last year only a few bids sold at first, and
then in the last three or four days they went, like
hotcakes. And this year the bids have been going at
the rate of about a hundred a day for the first four
days, which means in about another day the whole
riot will be sold out.
Conversational comments regarding this fact were
dropped at one of your local sororities. What, the ques
tion went, could be the reason for this rush sale?
* * >!« *
then a sorority woman took the conversational
reins in hand, and stated very firmly: "You know,
I believe—l mean this seriously now —I believe that
women are becoming more conscious of men."
This is news. And yet, in the light of what is going
on on our national front, it is something which is
very likely to happen.
When you say it out loud, it may sound like a
funnypaper plot, but you can't get around the rather
biological fact that the new armyish trend which is
shouldering its way into civilian life is bringing on a
new type of feminine thought. Some of the fellows are
being drafted. Some think joining the army would be
a good life. People are being shipped hci'e. Things
are turning over pretty rapidly. Food for conscious
ness.
Overt evidences of this trend can be seen in, for
instance, the girls in the Joe Palooka comic strip that
are just crazy for the uniform and for the soldiers. In
the girl who broke into the papers recently because
she stowed away on a destroyer. In the casual jok
ing remark made by Sylvia Berry at an Excom meet
ing a few weeks ago, where, when questioned con
cerning extending certain privileges to soldiers, she
said:
"That field has already been explored—wow."
* * * *
9RETTY superficial bits of evidence, aren't they?
But you must admit that they are indicative of
something that is going on inside these United States.
All along the line, the women are kissing the boys
goodbye. And when they aren't directly affected, they
are at least reading about what is happening to thou
sands of other women in other places. And they are
reading about it; and they are thinking about it. And
it's pretty hard to completely conceal what you mull
over in your mind.
That sorority woman struck close to a bulls-eye
when she said: "You know, I believe—l mean this se
riously now—l believe that women are becoming more
conscious of men."
And what about the men? Yeah, brethren, here
the scattered bread floweth back on the river five
fold! Yeah, brethren.
The thought of a year in one of those army camps
can certainly raise a stream of woman-consciousness.
