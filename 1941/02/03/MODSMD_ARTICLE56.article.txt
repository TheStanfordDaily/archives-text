# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
Editor's Note: The (low of Daily Campus Opin
ions reminds us of a recent New Yorker caption,
quoted from the Manliassct Mail: "An anonymous
letter received this week by the Manliassct Mail
does not appear in this issue as the sender's name
was not attached. While names are withheld
from publication upon request, they must he on
file. If the writer will supply his name, the letter
will he published, although its content doesn't
seem to make sense."
