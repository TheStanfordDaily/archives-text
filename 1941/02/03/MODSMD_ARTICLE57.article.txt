# WHO "BELLS" THE CAT?

J I HE EDITOR, SIR:
Contrary to public opinion, I have a friend.
More than that, my friend is a Stanford woman. In
addition to both these disadvantages, she is an Alpha
Phi.
But the thing that really chills me is that she has
been having dreams. It could happen to anyone. For
the last four nights in succession she has been stand
ing on the lower deck of Dick Spencer's boathouse
with a Stanford letterman. Conversation ensues. He
says, "You go first." She says, "No, you go first."
Ditto, and yet again, ditto. Finally, in desperation,
she dives into Lagunita, and he follows. 'She swims
beyond the reach of the frogs. Whereupon, he clubs
her.
This can't go on. Unless Lake Lagunita is drained,
or all Block S men are confined to quarters, my friend
will have to take Abnormal Psych as a defensive meas
ure. She has tried the Modern Library Giant by
Freud. No soap.
