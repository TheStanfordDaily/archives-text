r pilE EDITOR, SIR:
As an interested reader of The Daily, I feel that
I have a right to express some views which are in
dicative of opinions I have heard expressed in various
places on the campus recently.
They concern your editorial page, which should re
flect the policy of the paper toward all issues con
cerning Stanford. That space which is not consumed
by advertising is in my opinion 60 per cent wasted on
verbiage. Your editorials are beyond reproach. But
the reviews have yet to express something worth
while about the cinema; most of them reflect a
twisted sense of humor and a lack of keen appreciation
of art in its various forms. Your "Campus Opinion"
column should be enlarged. The London Times is a
national institution in Great Britain partly because of
a like column. Many Stanford students read avidly
those opinions you deign to print. But chief among
the space wasters is Mr. Ames' column, "Bull Ses
sion." It is simply an enlarged "Campus Opinion"
column given over to the mediocre talents of one who
has little to say and does not know how to express
himself.
If this aids you in realizing the attitude of many
of us, I shall be very glad. If it is printed, I shall
admire your attitude. If it is withheld, you can imagine
yourselves creating a stifled but not baffled opposi
tion to your censorship.
