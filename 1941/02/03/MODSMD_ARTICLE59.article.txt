# Lamarr, Gable Wrestle With Communistic Hash
## 
### 
"Comrade X," starring Clark Cable
and Iledy Lamarr, now playing at
the Stanford Theater.
Somebody told us that down in
Hollywood they gathered up all the
anti-Communistic and anti-Fascist
jokes lying around on the cutting
room floors and spliced them to
gether and got a picture called
"Comrade X."
Maybe they did. But however they
threw it together, they got a pic
ture with some very poor acting,
some very funny jokes, and out of
it all, the answer to the question,
"What'll we do with the next couple
of hours?" Because seeing "Com
rade X" is a good way to spend a
few hours having a good time laugh
ing.
W HAT TO LOOK FOR
We can't tell you the story of the
plot, because it would spoil the
whole effect for those of you that will
see it. So the next best thing is to
tell you what to look for.
Clark Gable is getting better and
better in every picture he plays.
Give him five more years and he'll
be capable of legitimate stage work.
In this film he plays the part of a
happy-go-lucky (they usually are
in the movies) American newspaper

man, who gets himself all mixed up
in Russian politics. Watch for the
scene under the tree at the end of
tlie street car line.
As always Hedy Lamarr is beau
tiful and doesn't act. She gets a
break in this picture though, be
cause her apparent lack of ability
to do anything but look beautiful,
doesn't hinder her a bit. She blun
ders through the film as a loyal
member of the Communist party and
everything she does is hilarious.
We're not sure whether she meant
it to be that way or not.
FULL OF SLAPSTICK
Watch for the slapstick comedy.
I The vehicle carries everything from
cameras disguised as portable ra
dios to almost burying live people.
Everyone is spying on everyone else
and it is a regular occurrence to
have Russian officials die from traf
fic accidents after pneumonia set in.
Look for the tank race. The in
congruity of the whole episode is so
ridiculous it's hilarious. Don't miss
j Hedy, alias Theodore, acting as a
street car conductor. All in all, don't
miss the show. It contains a good
bit of fine satire buried in a bunch
of old jokes, that somehow comes
out in a good mixture, producing a
laugh riot. —Steele

"Comrade X," starring Clark Cable
and Iledy Lamarr, now playing at
the Stanford Theater.
Somebody told us that down in
Hollywood they gathered up all the
anti-Communistic and anti-Fascist
jokes lying around on the cutting
room floors and spliced them to
gether and got a picture called
"Comrade X."
Maybe they did. But however they
threw it together, they got a pic
ture with some very poor acting,
some very funny jokes, and out of
it all, the answer to the question,
"What'll we do with the next couple
of hours?" Because seeing "Com
rade X" is a good way to spend a
few hours having a good time laugh
ing.
W HAT TO LOOK FOR
We can't tell you the story of the
plot, because it would spoil the
whole effect for those of you that will
see it. So the next best thing is to
tell you what to look for.
Clark Gable is getting better and
better in every picture he plays.
Give him five more years and he'll
be capable of legitimate stage work.
In this film he plays the part of a
happy-go-lucky (they usually are
in the movies) American newspaper

man, who gets himself all mixed up
in Russian politics. Watch for the
scene under the tree at the end of
tlie street car line.
As always Hedy Lamarr is beau
tiful and doesn't act. She gets a
break in this picture though, be
cause her apparent lack of ability
to do anything but look beautiful,
doesn't hinder her a bit. She blun
ders through the film as a loyal
member of the Communist party and
everything she does is hilarious.
We're not sure whether she meant
it to be that way or not.
FULL OF SLAPSTICK
Watch for the slapstick comedy.
I The vehicle carries everything from
cameras disguised as portable ra
dios to almost burying live people.
Everyone is spying on everyone else
and it is a regular occurrence to
have Russian officials die from traf
fic accidents after pneumonia set in.
Look for the tank race. The in
congruity of the whole episode is so
ridiculous it's hilarious. Don't miss
j Hedy, alias Theodore, acting as a
street car conductor. All in all, don't
miss the show. It contains a good
bit of fine satire buried in a bunch
of old jokes, that somehow comes
out in a good mixture, producing a
laugh riot. —Steele
