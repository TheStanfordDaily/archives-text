# Women Leer as Li'l Abners Mailt Over 2-cent Head Price
## 
### 
Farm women arc holding the social whip hand this week and it's cost
ing them $1.97 to do it. Most of the 420 local Daisy Macs who clutch the
instrument—its form is a bit of pasteboard—in their hot little palms feel
that they have their money's worth. Only 80 of these pasteboards arc left.
"What irks me is that the men arc represented by the 2 cents," ranted

one prospective Li'l Abner. And the,
women leer and nod.
Cut though they are, Stanford men
are bending over backward —or
would it be forward?—angling for a
bid to the touted Sadie Hawkins
Hop, to be held Friday night in the
Women's gym from 9:30 to 1
o'clock. An informal survey reveals
that they are willing to turn their
cars over to women who are with
holding invitations because of the
transportation problem. As one
woman put it, "That's real anxiety!"
GAIETIES STARS
Pat Adams, chairman of the Hop,
has arranged to have stars of last
year's Gaieties on hand at the dance
to perform during intermissions.
These luminaries include Patty
Bouchard, Gerry Hughes, Mary
Merner, and Tommy Howard.
Art McCue and his band have
been signed for the affair and will
appear dressed in the best Ozark
tradition.
NO CAE STUDENTS
Although some mention was orig
inally made of making some bids
available to Cal students who will
be here for the basketball game,
this plan has been dropped. "It
looks now as though the number of
bids we can sell will not accommo
date all the Stanford people who
want to go," reasoned Chairman
Adams.
With the week-end total of bids
sold resting at 420, the few remain
ing will probably be gone by tonight
or at the latest tomorrow some time,
according to an estimate by Miss
Inez Stevens in the A.S.S.U. office
where the tickets are being sold.

that they have their money's worth. Only 80 of these pasteboards arc left.
"What irks me is that the men arc represented by the 2 cents," ranted

one prospective Li'l Abner. And the,
women leer and nod.
Cut though they are, Stanford men
are bending over backward —or
would it be forward?—angling for a
bid to the touted Sadie Hawkins
Hop, to be held Friday night in the
Women's gym from 9:30 to 1
o'clock. An informal survey reveals
that they are willing to turn their
cars over to women who are with
holding invitations because of the
transportation problem. As one
woman put it, "That's real anxiety!"
GAIETIES STARS
Pat Adams, chairman of the Hop,
has arranged to have stars of last
year's Gaieties on hand at the dance
to perform during intermissions.
These luminaries include Patty
Bouchard, Gerry Hughes, Mary
Merner, and Tommy Howard.
Art McCue and his band have
been signed for the affair and will
appear dressed in the best Ozark
tradition.
NO CAE STUDENTS
Although some mention was orig
inally made of making some bids
available to Cal students who will
be here for the basketball game,
this plan has been dropped. "It
looks now as though the number of
bids we can sell will not accommo
date all the Stanford people who
want to go," reasoned Chairman
Adams.
With the week-end total of bids
sold resting at 420, the few remain
ing will probably be gone by tonight
or at the latest tomorrow some time,
according to an estimate by Miss
Inez Stevens in the A.S.S.U. office
where the tickets are being sold.
Farm women arc holding the social whip hand this week and it's cost
ing them $1.97 to do it. Most of the 420 local Daisy Macs who clutch the
instrument—its form is a bit of pasteboard—in their hot little palms feel
that they have their money's worth. Only 80 of these pasteboards arc left.
