# Trueblood Speaks On College Values
## 
### 
Dr. D. Elton Trueblood gave his
first sermon of this quarter yester
day morning at 11 o'clock in the
Stanford Memorial Chapel.
The topic of his discussion, "The
Creation of the Future," explained
the ways in which the universities
are maintaining a better world for
all its inhabitants.
"The fundamental task of the uni
versities is the guardianship of
eternal values," was quoted from
President Conant of Harvard Uni
versity. President Conant's report,
which has been widely publicized,
inspired Dr. Trueblood's sermon.
"To a large extent in America,"
said Trueblood, "the University is
taking the place of the Church which
formerly occupied the main place in
maintaining spiritual standards."
