### BOB LOW 
r JPHAT conference in Paris yester
day among Hitler's special en
voy, Otto Abentz, old Marshall Pe
tain's good friend Admiral Darlan,
and Pierre Laval, was full of signs
and portents. The trouble is, that
while anyone could see the signs
and smell the portents, nobody
knows what happened.
So interested world observers have
fallen back on the old-fashioned fac
ulty of putting two and two together?
and it is safe to say that neither
Britain nor the United States likes
what is the most probable conclu
sion. It is likely that quite a few
Frenchmen, who were not con
sulted, will not approve either.
Prime factor in the problem is
Laval, the gentleman who thinks
Hitler is the best horse in the
European race. When Laval and
his collaborator, Paul Baudouin,
were ousted from the Vichy cab
inet in December, there was
much glee in democratic circles, al
though 110 one had much faith in
the permanency of the shake-up.

TIITLER let the old gentleman en
joy his triumph for a little over
a month, seeing to it, however, that
satellite Laval did not remain un
der arrest long. Yesterday's meeting
was Der Fuehrer's wrap on the
knuckles; ;Jid it hurt. As a result,
the Vichy government is being
strangled into a much closer co
operation with the Axis.
It is probable that Laval will
return to Vichy, nominally to bis
old post as minister of foreign
affairs and propaganda, but he
will, in reality, be acting in the
name of Petain, directing the ef
forts of a cabinet composed chiefly
of technicians.
Working with Laval will be Ad
miral Darlan, Paul Baudoin, and
General Charles Huntziger. These
four will constitute the French gov
ernment, it is assumed, with Petain
retaining his full authoirty as Chief
of State. The title should be quite
a comfort to the aged marshall.
At any rate, it was announced in
Paris that the conference has
"practically ended" the 50-day
Franco-German crisis, and the good
word went out last night that "only
the details" remained to be worked
out. Rapid conferences of this sort
are possible when the party of the
first part is standing over the party
of the second part with a gun.
And the gun is loaded with the
shells of threatening the cancella
tion of an armistice and the renewal
of war.
* * *
jyjEANWHILE in the United j
States, a country practically
cross-eyed from eyeing the involve
ments of European and Asiatic wars,
and its own national emergency,
paused for a moment to focus on
the Supreme Court.
For yesterday the court, in a
unanimous decision, upheld the
constitutionality of the New Deal's
key Wages and Hours Law. In a
sweeping opinion Justice Stone af
firmed the broad regulatory powers
of Congress and held that Congress
has full authoirty under the Con
stitution to bar from interstate com
merce articles produced in violation
of the established federal standards.
However, broad as the opinion
was, it did not do away with the
child labor problem, which has
been festering around the nation's
political swamps since the Con
gressional Amendment of 1924.
The wage-hour law bans employ
ment of children under 1(5, in the
manufacture of all goods destined
for interstate commerce.
But in the case of goods destined
only for intrastate commerce, the
tots can still legally work their
chubby fingers to the bone—at least
until the remaining 12 states get
around to ratifying the 1924 amend
ment.
The wage-hour ruling was ap
proved in rulings on two test cases,
one of which involved a Georgia
lumber company indicted on charges
of failing to pay the minimum hourly
wage and refusing to pay time-and
a-half overtime in excess of the
statutory week.
The indictments were quashed by
Federal Judge William H. Barrett
on grounds that the law was un
constitutional. Today's rulings re
instated them.

The wage-hour law bans employ
ment of children under 1(5, in the
manufacture of all goods destined
for interstate commerce.
But in the case of goods destined
only for intrastate commerce, the
tots can still legally work their
chubby fingers to the bone—at least
until the remaining 12 states get
around to ratifying the 1924 amend
ment.
The wage-hour ruling was ap
proved in rulings on two test cases,
one of which involved a Georgia
lumber company indicted on charges
of failing to pay the minimum hourly
wage and refusing to pay time-and
a-half overtime in excess of the
statutory week.
The indictments were quashed by
Federal Judge William H. Barrett
on grounds that the law was un
constitutional. Today's rulings re

r JPHAT conference in Paris yester
day among Hitler's special en
voy, Otto Abentz, old Marshall Pe
tain's good friend Admiral Darlan,
and Pierre Laval, was full of signs
and portents. The trouble is, that
while anyone could see the signs
and smell the portents, nobody
knows what happened.
So interested world observers have
fallen back on the old-fashioned fac
ulty of putting two and two together?
and it is safe to say that neither
Britain nor the United States likes
what is the most probable conclu
sion. It is likely that quite a few
Frenchmen, who were not con
sulted, will not approve either.
Prime factor in the problem is
Laval, the gentleman who thinks
Hitler is the best horse in the
European race. When Laval and
his collaborator, Paul Baudouin,
were ousted from the Vichy cab
inet in December, there was
much glee in democratic circles, al
though 110 one had much faith in
the permanency of the shake-up.

TIITLER let the old gentleman en
joy his triumph for a little over
a month, seeing to it, however, that
satellite Laval did not remain un
der arrest long. Yesterday's meeting
was Der Fuehrer's wrap on the
knuckles; ;Jid it hurt. As a result,
the Vichy government is being
strangled into a much closer co
operation with the Axis.
It is probable that Laval will
return to Vichy, nominally to bis
old post as minister of foreign
affairs and propaganda, but he
will, in reality, be acting in the
name of Petain, directing the ef
forts of a cabinet composed chiefly
of technicians.
Working with Laval will be Ad
miral Darlan, Paul Baudoin, and
General Charles Huntziger. These
four will constitute the French gov
ernment, it is assumed, with Petain
retaining his full authoirty as Chief
of State. The title should be quite
a comfort to the aged marshall.
At any rate, it was announced in
Paris that the conference has
"practically ended" the 50-day
Franco-German crisis, and the good
word went out last night that "only
the details" remained to be worked
out. Rapid conferences of this sort
are possible when the party of the
first part is standing over the party
of the second part with a gun.
And the gun is loaded with the
shells of threatening the cancella
tion of an armistice and the renewal
of war.

jyjEANWHILE in the United j
States, a country practically
cross-eyed from eyeing the involve
ments of European and Asiatic wars,
and its own national emergency,
paused for a moment to focus on
the Supreme Court.
For yesterday the court, in a
unanimous decision, upheld the
constitutionality of the New Deal's
key Wages and Hours Law. In a
sweeping opinion Justice Stone af
firmed the broad regulatory powers
of Congress and held that Congress
has full authoirty under the Con
stitution to bar from interstate com
merce articles produced in violation
of the established federal standards.
However, broad as the opinion
was, it did not do away with the
child labor problem, which has
been festering around the nation's
political swamps since the Con
gressional Amendment of 1924.
The wage-hour law bans employ
ment of children under 1(5, in the
manufacture of all goods destined
for interstate commerce.
But in the case of goods destined
only for intrastate commerce, the
tots can still legally work their
chubby fingers to the bone—at least
until the remaining 12 states get
around to ratifying the 1924 amend
ment.
The wage-hour ruling was ap
proved in rulings on two test cases,
one of which involved a Georgia
lumber company indicted on charges
of failing to pay the minimum hourly
wage and refusing to pay time-and
a-half overtime in excess of the
statutory week.
The indictments were quashed by
Federal Judge William H. Barrett
on grounds that the law was un
constitutional. Today's rulings re
instated them.
r JPHAT conference in Paris yester
day among Hitler's special en
voy, Otto Abentz, old Marshall Pe
tain's good friend Admiral Darlan,
and Pierre Laval, was full of signs
and portents. The trouble is, that
while anyone could see the signs
and smell the portents, nobody
knows what happened.
So interested world observers have
fallen back on the old-fashioned fac
ulty of putting two and two together?
and it is safe to say that neither
Britain nor the United States likes
what is the most probable conclu
sion. It is likely that quite a few
Frenchmen, who were not con
sulted, will not approve either.
Prime factor in the problem is
Laval, the gentleman who thinks
Hitler is the best horse in the
European race. When Laval and
his collaborator, Paul Baudouin,
were ousted from the Vichy cab
inet in December, there was
much glee in democratic circles, al
though 110 one had much faith in
the permanency of the shake-up.

TIITLER let the old gentleman en
joy his triumph for a little over
a month, seeing to it, however, that
satellite Laval did not remain un
der arrest long. Yesterday's meeting
was Der Fuehrer's wrap on the
knuckles; ;Jid it hurt. As a result,
the Vichy government is being
strangled into a much closer co
operation with the Axis.
It is probable that Laval will
return to Vichy, nominally to bis
old post as minister of foreign
affairs and propaganda, but he
will, in reality, be acting in the
name of Petain, directing the ef
forts of a cabinet composed chiefly
of technicians.
Working with Laval will be Ad
miral Darlan, Paul Baudoin, and
General Charles Huntziger. These
four will constitute the French gov
ernment, it is assumed, with Petain
retaining his full authoirty as Chief
of State. The title should be quite
a comfort to the aged marshall.
At any rate, it was announced in
Paris that the conference has
"practically ended" the 50-day
Franco-German crisis, and the good
word went out last night that "only
the details" remained to be worked
out. Rapid conferences of this sort
are possible when the party of the
first part is standing over the party
of the second part with a gun.
And the gun is loaded with the
shells of threatening the cancella
tion of an armistice and the renewal
of war.
