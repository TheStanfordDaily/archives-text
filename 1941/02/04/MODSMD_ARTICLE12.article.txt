# Bid Sellout Frustrates 'Li'l Abners'
## Pat Adams Attempts To Get Extra Space For Hawkins Dance 
### 
With the last bid sold yesterday at
11:!!0 o'clock and a waiting list of
50, Pat Adams, chairman of the
Sadie Hawkins Hop, was attempting
last night to have both sides of the
Women's Gym opened for the dance.
If she succeeds in this venture,
Chairman Adams announced that
more tickets will be placed on sale.
The force of her persuasion, she em
phasized, varies directly with the
number of potential Daisy Maes on
the waiting list.
After the sellout, campus women
consulted on the profits of scalping
Sadie Hawkins bids. One of the
more timid coeds ventured, "Gee,
we could sell 'em for $2!"
Scalping opportunities were slack,
however, with the announcement
from Chairman Adams that "I don't
think we'll have to refuse anyone
admission. There are several other
angles we can work and it's not fair
to keep anyone from going."
Plans for intermission entertain
ment from assorted Gaieties stars
were still in force and Mary Leigh
ton Taylor, in charge of arrange
ments, has announced that refresh
ments will consist in part of pop
corn balls — more to be announced
later.
Mary Bills, another member of
the committee, has ordered small
but noisy horns for everyone at
tending.
Chairman Adams urged Daisy
Maes without tickets to continue
signing up on the waiting list. "The
longer the list, the stronger the
chance of opening both sides of the
gym-"
