yesterday in a letter from Dr. Nich

bia University. Two representatives
of the endowment will travel with
the group.
The purpose of the two months'
tour to several Latin American coun

a small, selected group of editors
and scholars from different parts of
the United States an opportunity to
increase their knowledge of Latin
America, to exchange information
and opinions with colleagues there,
and to bring back to their profes
sional work fresh impressions gained
in that way."
CLASSES TO CONTINUE
Special leave has been granted
Dr. Stuart from his academic duties
so that he might accept the invita
tion. Arrangements are being made
to take care of his classes.
A former member of the Stanford
faculty, Dr. Harold Benjamin, now
of the University of Maryland, has
also been invited to join the party.
The itinerary for the group is
planned to "leave them at liberty to
follow their own interests" as far as
possible. The object of the trip is to
promote good will between the
Americas.
