gible students, should be dropped

placed on the Law Steps.
Eligible nominees will face the
acid test Feb. 11, election day, when
votes will be cast to decide future
occupants of the ten positions.
VACANT POSTS
Posts open include: one on the
B.A.C. which was left vacant by
Clyde Jeffrey's appointment to posi
tion of assistant track coach. Three
execuitve posts are open: those of
graduate man, junior man, and
sophomore woman. For the past
year these positions have been held
by John Porter, Bob Low, and Syl
via Berry.
Three Men's Council positions and
the same number of berths on
Women's Council will also be filled.
"Please note that all women in
order to be eligible for nomination
to any of these Women's Council
posts must have 120 units," Betty
Moses warned last night.
NEW YELL LEADER
In addition to the above posts, the
coming election will also decide the
successor to Gordy Nicoll as head
yell leader and that successor's two
assistants.
"We hope there will be increased
interest in this year's election,"
Betty Moses added. "In a few days
Excom will act on a new system
which will bring out a greater per
centage of the vote. This should give
a truer voting picture, and a better
chance to all nominees."
"And, in conclusion, remember
that only those persons who are
eligible may sign these nomination
petitions. That is, men may not sign
petitions for Women's Council, or
vice versa."
Nominations are now in order.
They opened this morning at 8 o'clock, and will remain open until
5 o'clock tomorrow afternoon. The prizes are ten crucial, key A.S.S.U.
