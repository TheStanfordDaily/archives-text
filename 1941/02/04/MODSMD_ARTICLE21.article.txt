# Vichy Rumor Says Laval May Return
## Change of Cabinet Predicted by Paper To Satisfy Germany 
### 
PARIS, Feh. 2 (UP).â€”A com
pletely new Vichy cabinet pledged
to closer collaboration with Adolf
Hitler and restoration to power of
Pierre Laval with "even greater au
thority" than before his ouster as
French vice-premier appeared im
minent Monday night.
Monday's conference in Paris
among Admiral Francois Darlan,
special emissary of Marshal Henri
Philippe Petain, the pro-German La
va! and Hitler's personal envoy, Otto
Abetz, was said to have "practically
ended" the 50-day-old crisis in
French-German relations.
PI TAIN TO STAY
Beaten and trouble-beset France
appeared to be heading toward a
government dominated by four men
- Laval, Admiral Darlan, Paul Bau
douin and General Charles Huntzi
ger with the aged Petain retaining
full authority as chief of state.
It is predicted in Vichy that within
a week the present cabinet of Petain
will be swept out and replaced by a
new cabinet, including Laval,
pledged to a policy of "active col
li; boration" with Germany.
Darlan, Minister of Navy and Pe
tain's closest confidant, arrived in
Paris aboard a special train from
Vichy at 7 a.m. to find a basis for
this collaboration in talks with Laval
and Abetz. It was said tonight that
'"only details remain to be worked
out."
HITLER DEMANDS FLEET
Official denials have been made in
Vichy of reports abroad that Hitler
lias demanded not only the return
to power of Laval but also the sur
render of France's immobilized fleet
of 100 or more warships and several
naval bases including Bizerte.
A shakeup in the Petain cabinet
may come within a few days after
Darlan's return to Vichy, it was
understood tonight.
