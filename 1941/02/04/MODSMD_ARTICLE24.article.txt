# Jackson Speaks on Business Careers at Vocom Meeting

### 
"Business men today need to know what's going on in the world," said
Dean .1. Hugh Jackson of the Stanford Graduate School of Business in a
talk before an audience of about 200 in Encina lobby last night. Dean
Jackson's talk opened this winter's Vocational Problems Series with the

( subject of "A Career in Business."
Speaking on the problem of what
school subjects to take in prepara
tion for a business career, Dean
Jackson stressed the importance of a
broad, general education.
"The practice at Stanford of re
quiring freshmen and sophomores to
take subjects from all general fields
is strongly favored by those of the
Business School faculty," the dean
remarked. "We find that the broader
the student's education is, the bet
ter his chances in business are."
In regard to specific subjects, the
dean recommended especially psy
chology. He also regarded as im
portant economics, political science,
sociology, biology and chemistry.
"The choice of a major, however,
depends to quite an extent on the
type of business you are planning to
enter. We customarily divide busi
ness into five general functional
fields: manufacturing, sales, finan
cial. personnel, and control.
"After deciding what general field
you want to go into, you should de
cide what specific type of business
you are interested in, such as petro
leum, automobile manufacturing, in
surance, and so on," the dean ad
vised.
However, it is possible to go too
far in trying to get into a "booming"
business, he cautioned. As an exam
ple of this he spoke of the large
numbers of college graduates in the
1920's that went into selling se
curities.
"Today," he remarked, "no one
wants to go into investment broker
age, and most of those that are in
it would like to get out."
As a contemporary example of this
dangerously "booming" type of busi
ness, the dean cited various indus
tries active in national defense,
such as airplane manufacturing.
In reply to a query about prospec
tive salaries, Dean Jackson said
that most college graduates who get
positions in business start 'at about
$2500 per year.
