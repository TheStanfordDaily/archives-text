OW it begins to look as though
Everett Dean wasn't so fai
wrong way back in November when
he forecast an unusually close
Southern Division cage race this
winter. The feat of the Ucla Bruins
Saturday night down in L.A. makes
the Indian coach a pretty good man
to ask about the weather when
planning to go to the beach.
With the Bears improving every
week, the Indian hoopsters are in
for a real struggle in the Pavilion
Friday night. Williams - Davidson
and Company will have the advan
tage of playing on their home court,
but against this the Bears can stack
the confidence gained by their two
victories over S.C.
'I his game may go a long way
toward deciding the champion
ship, and then again it might just
snarl the race up into a tie. If
Cal can duplicate the perform
ance of their southern relations
they'll step into a tie for the lead.
That would mean that the race
would probably be in doubt until
the end of this month, when the two
teams meet again, over in Berkeley
on Feb. 28 and here on March 1.
But you can't sell that kind of talk
around here. Now that we've got
less than two weeks left before va
cating (he S.E. chair, we might as
well toss our neck out and whip off
a few predictions.
The first is simple, thai the In
dian quintet will take the Bears
Friday. And further, that they'll
also lick the Cal team on Feb. 28.
* * *
Y OOKING further into the crystal
coke bottle, we find the Indians
n lose only two more tilts this
ison at the most. The first of these
the March 1 match, which might
) to Cal if Stanford has the title
inched. The second, strangely
enough, is the latter of the two S.C.
games to be played in the South- j
land.
Straying further, as the literati j
would put it. afield, we run into a '
couolo of other Farm teams that
might come up with a championship, j
They are Nort Thornton's swimmers I
and the varsity ruggers.
There's a chance that the rugby
squad might get nipped some day i
on a wet field, hut the splashers j
needn't worry about weather
conditions. It'll be no easy road to

they both have the potential

JVEWS flash of the week.
Albany opened Saturday.
And the fastest time for six fur
longs was 1:17 3-5. Which, if you
aren't familiar with the sport of
kings and touts, is just about three

last year.

scoring data released today dis- !
closes one very interesting fact.
Jackie Robinson, who waltzed
away with the scoring honors last
year, is currently tied for third
position in the racc.
And the only reason he's in the
first ten at all is some 18 charity
losses he made good. The Negro
flash has less field goals than the
first 13 men in the standings.
Which information may not be as
encouraging as it would at first ap
pear.
Because when Jackie starts hit
ting the hoop that Bruin quintet is
going to he very hard to handle.
And how many people would he
unhappy if the Uclans teed off on
S.C. a couple of times and the
Trojans wound up in the cellar?

Jackie Robinson, who waltzed

position in the racc.
And the only reason he's in the

Southern Division cage race this
winter. The feat of the Ucla Bruins
Saturday night down in L.A. makes
the Indian coach a pretty good man
to ask about the weather when
planning to go to the beach.
With the Bears improving every

JVEWS flash of the week.
Albany opened Saturday.
And the fastest time for six fur
longs was 1:17 3-5. Which, if you
aren't familiar with the sport of
kings and touts, is just about three
seconds behind the time of the
broken dov/n goat one of the broth- j

r PHE southern division individual
scoring data released today dis- !
closes one very interesting fact.
Jackie Robinson, who waltzed
away with the scoring honors last
year, is currently tied for third
position in the racc.
And the only reason he's in the
first ten at all is some 18 charity
losses he made good. The Negro

first 13 men in the standings.
