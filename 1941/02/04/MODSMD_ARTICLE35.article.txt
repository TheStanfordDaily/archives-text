# U.C.L.A. Series Reveals Burness'
## 
### 
Stanford discovered one thing
j while being defeated by U.C.L.A.
last Saturday night: Don Burness is
definitely an important cog in that
Indian cage machine.
Since the Indians made it plenty j
close in the closing minutes of the
game, it is only logical to believe j
that they would have copped the
game had not Burness been banned
from the game on fouls in the first
half. Not that Ed Voss, sub center,
didn't play good ball, for he did.
However, no one could expect him
to handle the duties with the same !
adeptness as Burness.
It wps Stanford's fast break that
had a great deal to do with the ;
Cards' 54-44 win Friday night; but
with Burness out Saturday night
that fast break was slowed down tc
a walk. They definitely needed his
speed and smooth ball handling, and I
most of all they needed his dead- j
eye shooting.
Johnny Fryer and Ernie Handels
man make the Westwooders a much '
better outfit than they were a year
ago when they had only Jackie Rob
inson. The Cards will probably have
a tough battle on their hands the
next time they meet the Bruins, too.
The loss of one game so far this
conference season doesn't look too
bad for the Indian cagers, for un-

I defeated teams just aren't expected
in basketball. The disappointing
part of the whole thing is that the
| game in which they were defeated
was so close.

Stanford discovered one thing
j while being defeated by U.C.L.A.
last Saturday night: Don Burness is
definitely an important cog in that
Indian cage machine.
Since the Indians made it plenty j
close in the closing minutes of the
game, it is only logical to believe j
that they would have copped the
game had not Burness been banned
from the game on fouls in the first
half. Not that Ed Voss, sub center,
didn't play good ball, for he did.
However, no one could expect him
to handle the duties with the same !
adeptness as Burness.
It wps Stanford's fast break that
had a great deal to do with the ;
Cards' 54-44 win Friday night; but
with Burness out Saturday night
that fast break was slowed down tc
a walk. They definitely needed his
speed and smooth ball handling, and I
most of all they needed his dead- j
eye shooting.
Johnny Fryer and Ernie Handels
man make the Westwooders a much '
better outfit than they were a year
ago when they had only Jackie Rob
inson. The Cards will probably have
a tough battle on their hands the
next time they meet the Bruins, too.
The loss of one game so far this
conference season doesn't look too
bad for the Indian cagers, for un-

I defeated teams just aren't expected
in basketball. The disappointing
part of the whole thing is that the
| game in which they were defeated
was so close.
