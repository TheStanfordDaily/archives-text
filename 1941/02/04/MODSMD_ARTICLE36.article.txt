## JERRY BRUCKER, Sports Editor Seals Squeeze 4-3 Victory From Cardinal Diamond Team 
### 
Big league baseball invaded the
Farm as Kenneally's Seals nabbed a
4-3 decision over Stanford's var
sity nine yesterday afternoon at the
Sunken Diamond, reversing the 2-1
victory of the Indians in their first
game.
Coach Harry Welter's club ou(hit
the Seals, 7-4. but two timely double
plays killed o(T a pair of Card rallies.
The game began as a pitcher's
duel of the first order between Stan
ford's Russ Smith and Kenneally's
A1 Musanti. Smith's overhead slants
baffled the Seals for three innings
as he gave up only one hit and three
walks.
Phil Wolf look over the mound
duties in the fourth and was touched
for a. double, which, combined with
two free passes, gave the Seals their
first run.
Stanford found Musanti in the
fourth, but not for long.
CARDS SCORE IN FIFTH
Stanford scored all its runs in
the fifth frame as Bob Ditlevson
started the merry-go-round with a
base blow between first and second,
and ''Cookie" South looped a Texas
leaguer into lelt field to put men on
first and second.
Wolter picked on Clark Graham to
pinch-hit for Wolf, and Graham did
his duty with a sharp single through
Musanti s legs, Ditlevson crossing
the plate, South stopping at second.
The professionals came to life in
the sixth as Claude Purkett took his
turn on the mound. Pfyl threw out
Dahlgren to start the inning with
the best play of the game, but Elton
Boone couldn't handle Arnold Trax
ler s blow down the third base line,
and the Seal left fielder was safe at
first.
Shelley McConnell blasted a
double about an inch away from i'ic
left field foul line, Trexler making
it to third. Purkitt settled down and
fanned Sven Jessen to relieve the

J pressure for a bit.
Eddie Kearse smashed a hard
; drive down the third base line,
j Boone making a nice stop on the
I ball, but from his deep position a
hurried throw into the dirt at first
j got away from Ray Hammett, and
Traxler and McConnell crossed the
plate. Musanti drove a two-bagger
into deep center field and Kearse
tallied with the Seals' third run of
the inning which was the margin of
victory.

Big league baseball invaded the
Farm as Kenneally's Seals nabbed a
4-3 decision over Stanford's var
sity nine yesterday afternoon at the
Sunken Diamond, reversing the 2-1
victory of the Indians in their first
game.
Coach Harry Welter's club ou(hit
the Seals, 7-4. but two timely double
plays killed o(T a pair of Card rallies.
The game began as a pitcher's
duel of the first order between Stan
ford's Russ Smith and Kenneally's
A1 Musanti. Smith's overhead slants
baffled the Seals for three innings
as he gave up only one hit and three
walks.
Phil Wolf look over the mound
duties in the fourth and was touched
for a. double, which, combined with
two free passes, gave the Seals their
first run.
Stanford found Musanti in the
fourth, but not for long.
CARDS SCORE IN FIFTH
Stanford scored all its runs in
the fifth frame as Bob Ditlevson
started the merry-go-round with a
base blow between first and second,
and ''Cookie" South looped a Texas
leaguer into lelt field to put men on
first and second.
Wolter picked on Clark Graham to
pinch-hit for Wolf, and Graham did
his duty with a sharp single through
Musanti s legs, Ditlevson crossing
the plate, South stopping at second.
The professionals came to life in
the sixth as Claude Purkett took his
turn on the mound. Pfyl threw out
Dahlgren to start the inning with
the best play of the game, but Elton
Boone couldn't handle Arnold Trax
ler s blow down the third base line,
and the Seal left fielder was safe at
first.
Shelley McConnell blasted a
double about an inch away from i'ic
left field foul line, Trexler making
it to third. Purkitt settled down and
fanned Sven Jessen to relieve the

J pressure for a bit.
Eddie Kearse smashed a hard
; drive down the third base line,
j Boone making a nice stop on the
I ball, but from his deep position a
hurried throw into the dirt at first
j got away from Ray Hammett, and
Traxler and McConnell crossed the
plate. Musanti drove a two-bagger
into deep center field and Kearse
tallied with the Seals' third run of
the inning which was the margin of
victory.
Gladdini's All-Stars come back for
a return engagement here tomorrow.
