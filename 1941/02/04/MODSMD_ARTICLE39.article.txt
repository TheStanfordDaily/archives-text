# Frosh to Meet Cub Hoopsters
## 
### 
Pecking away at the basket in the
Pavilion, Stanford's frosh hoopsters
ran through a practice scrimmage
yesterday in preparation for the
coming frosh-Cal titanic, hilled for
Friday night.
Coach Beeb L*ee gave a lot of in
' dividual help yesterday, especially
to Fred Oliver, whom he is groom
ing for a return to the center spot
after a long absence.
Still undefeated in '41, the yearling
cagers get a chance at their tradi
tional Bear Cub rivals in a three
game series. After Friday's game,
the next two will be played on
Feb. 28 and March 1.
Between Friday and the last two
Cal engagements, the frosh take on
Lowell High School Feb. 21, and
Monterey High School the follow
ing evening.
