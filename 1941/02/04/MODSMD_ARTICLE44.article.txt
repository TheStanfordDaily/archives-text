# Bellwether on Babes

AD," murmured Bellwether as he peered
vU into the room of the Men's Rest Home
which I had been calling home for two days.
"You look bad!"
"Just a minute, Emery," I warbled accusingly.
"Is that the way to Console an invalid? Damned
calloused approach. Where's all the sweetness
and light that's supposed to be traditional?"
The Bellwether beam was utterly unruffled.
"Plain unvarnished truth, Laddie. Can'tmake a
lily out of a turnip. Anyway, here's a box of
candy to ease your tribulations."
Overlooking the turnip remark looked like
the magnanimous thing to do. "Thanks, Bell
wether. That square piece a chew?"
"Yurp," mumbled the Great Man thickly.
"God, too."
"Don't talk while your mouth's full, Bell
wether. It isn't becoming." I slid the candy to
comfortable reach. "What's on your mind?"
The Bellwether bulk eased over on the foot
of the bed, to the acute dismay of my feet.
"Well, Laddie," he said, enveloping half the
supply of candy in one enormous paw, "you've
heard of the Activities File?"
"Certainly, Emery." I started on my second
bit of candy. "What about it?"
The Sage grinned through another mouthful
of sweets. "Kinda gave me an idea. How about
a Babe File? You know, cross-catalogue all the
women on campus so that any laddie who
wants a date can call the central office and get
what he wants."
I looked at the Great Man accusingly. "Listen,
Bellwether. The wrong man's in this bed. It
should be you!"
Emery overlooked the insinuation. "Now,
now, Laddie. Trouble is you have no vision.
Think of what a boon it would be. All a laddie
would have to do is ring the central office and
get exactly the lassie he wants for the occasion."
I was unconvinced. "Fine idea, Emery, but
it won't work."
The Bellwether forefinger beat a rapid tattoo
fractions of an inch from my nose. "Vision, Lad
die, you need vision! We'll catalogue each babe
according to size, geenral coloring, and other
distinguishing features. In addition, we'll cross
file according to whether she's the 'beach pic
nic,' 'formal dance,' or 'sympathetic' type, and
so on."
"Hmmmm. Mebbe so, Emery." I watched
the Great Man unblinkingly finish the remnants
of the candy. "But I'm still not convinced."
The Sage grimaced. "Look, Laddie, after
someone takes out a babe he reports back to
the central office. Then we enter the remarks
on our confidential files. See? We can't slip
at all doing that. If a babe gets consistently
bad reports, we'll have one of our staff look
into it." Bellwether beamed conclusively.
"Emery," I apologized, "I must be a confirmed
doubter. I'm sorry I didn't see the light sooner."
"There, there, Laddie. Don't fret." The Bell
wether hulk rose to leave. "Bye now."
I yelled my last question out the door after
him. "Bellwether! What will you do about the
Sadie Hawkins dances?"
There was no answer.â€”W. C.
