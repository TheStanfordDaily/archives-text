REHASH OF USED TRASH
A s INDICATED by a Campus Opinion, some of you
were offended. You weren't included in the re
cent "You Are a Stanfordite If" confab. So, at the
momentous request of all three of you readers, here
goes for another round-robin.
If you are a man, you are a Stanfordite . . .
If you aren't going to the Sadie Hawkins Dance. If
you tell everybody you don't give a damn about going
to that damn ole dance, but in your heart you know
that you would say yes faster than Carmen Miranda
running over that bomba-la-bomba tune if some lovely
asked you.
If in the morning you turn first to the Hospital
reports in The Daily, and chuckle diabolically all the
way down the list of your friends. If you wonder what
that girl you took out last week-end is doing in the
Women's Rest Home.
* * * *
If you picked out the frailest, palest woman you
could find, and took her skiing for a week-end. You
had it all planned how, in your best aggressive style,
you were going to show her how to do it. And then,
she slalomed rings around you, yelling "skiheil" at
the top of the loudest lungs you ever heard.
If you've waited day after day for the Quad to
announce "definitely the last day for Quad pictures."
And then gave up in desperation because they just
never announced it. Every day is the last day.
If your mother asks you if you were born with
those saddle shoes and green plaid socks on.
* * * *
AND if you're a woman, you are a Stanfordite . . .
If you've bought another sweater since last week.
If you've given up the idea of eating cheese sand
wiches in the Cellar.
If you think that girl who wrote about dreaming
that lettermen hit her over the head in Lake Lagunita
is working a pretty good angle, and you wish you
had thought of the idea sooner.
If, being a sorority pledge, the powers that be told
you that now is the time for all good women to come
to the aid of the Friends of the Foreign Legion Com
mittee, or the Any Old Clothes Committee—or just
any old committee.
If you can drink any Stanford man under the table
on five minutes notice.
* * * *
If you can run from the front seat of the car
thi'ough the front door of your house or hall in half
the time of the average Alpha Delt.
Or Zete.
If your nose is beginning to look like a coke
bottle, and even the food in Roble begins to taste like
a fresh lime coke or the squashed cigarette he has
been carrying around in his hip pocket for the past
week.
If you wonder why in the name of Fanny Brice
you are reading this.
So now you are a Stanfordite.

If you picked out the frailest, palest woman you
could find, and took her skiing for a week-end. You
had it all planned how, in your best aggressive style,
you were going to show her how to do it. And then,
she slalomed rings around you, yelling "skiheil" at
the top of the loudest lungs you ever heard.
If you've waited day after day for the Quad to
announce "definitely the last day for Quad pictures."
And then gave up in desperation because they just
never announced it. Every day is the last day.
If your mother asks you if you were born with
those saddle shoes and green plaid socks on.
* * * *
AND if you're a woman, you are a Stanfordite . . .
If you've bought another sweater since last week.
If you've given up the idea of eating cheese sand
wiches in the Cellar.
If you think that girl who wrote about dreaming
that lettermen hit her over the head in Lake Lagunita
is working a pretty good angle, and you wish you
had thought of the idea sooner.
If, being a sorority pledge, the powers that be told
you that now is the time for all good women to come
to the aid of the Friends of the Foreign Legion Com
mittee, or the Any Old Clothes Committee—or just
any old committee.
If you can drink any Stanford man under the table
on five minutes notice.
* * * *
If you can run from the front seat of the car
thi'ough the front door of your house or hall in half
the time of the average Alpha Delt.
Or Zete.
If your nose is beginning to look like a coke
bottle, and even the food in Roble begins to taste like
a fresh lime coke or the squashed cigarette he has
been carrying around in his hip pocket for the past
week.
If you wonder why in the name of Fanny Brice
you are reading this.
So now you are a Stanfordite.

If you are a man, you are a Stanfordite . . .
If you aren't going to the Sadie Hawkins Dance. If
you tell everybody you don't give a damn about going
to that damn ole dance, but in your heart you know
that you would say yes faster than Carmen Miranda
running over that bomba-la-bomba tune if some lovely
asked you.
If in the morning you turn first to the Hospital
reports in The Daily, and chuckle diabolically all the
way down the list of your friends. If you wonder what
that girl you took out last week-end is doing in the
Women's Rest Home.
