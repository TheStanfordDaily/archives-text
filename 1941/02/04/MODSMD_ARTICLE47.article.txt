# CAMPUS OPINION
## WHAT COMES OFF? 
### 
EDITOR, SIR:
We have not, as yet, looked further ahead than
the next few years in our viewpoints on the present
war. All that we have done is to view the immediate
circumstances and attitudes that sux-round us now. We
have assumed that the news and viewpoints we have
are entii'ely unbiased and correct. That is obviously
false.
But disregarding all present factors concerning this
war—disregarding our likes and dislikes—disregarding
our censors news and pro-British attitudes—what will
follow after the war?
To quote Lincoln: "Suppose you go to war, you
cannot fight always, and when, after much loss on both
sides, and no gain on either, you cease fighting, the
identical old questions are again upon you."
I would like to invite discussion of this subject. If
England wins—then what? If England loses—then
what? What will be a fair peace? How can the future
wars be prevented? Who shall pay for the havoc? Let
us call to mind Wilson's fourteen points. Let us call to
mind the peace following the last war and see what
conclusions we can reach concerning the after effects
of this war.
This is an aspect that we have not considered, and
let us view it from the standpoint of a better world
after the strife and with an eye toward justice and
fair play.
