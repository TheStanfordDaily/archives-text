r jPHE EDITOR, SIR:
I think that I shall never see
A Packard stop for you or me.
We walk to school and get a ride
In rattling Fords with nine inside.
Your chances for a lift are fine
In models, say, of '29.
A clatter down the road—you grin,
For soon some guy will shout, "Hop in!"
But. when you hear a soothing purr,
To hope for rides is but to err.
Democracy in heaps—O.K.
The Packards sneer and look away.
