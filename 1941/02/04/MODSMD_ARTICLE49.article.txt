# 'EUROPE'S CANCER'
## 
### 
r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
At last our great university has produced a
man who understands this world and its historical
processes with remarkable clarity. I am referring to
none other than "Not a tennis star." Never before has
this "malignant growth," fascism, been explained in
such easily understood terms . Let us all don our armor,
raise our banners, and march forth to cut out that
"cancer" that is engulfing Europe.
But how these warriors will be surprised and their
prophets embarrassed when they return home. For
they will find, as did the French soldiers when they
returned home, economic chaos, unemployed in num
bers never imagined possible, and not fifty million
people living by starving as now but many more. And
on top of this economic decay will be built a struc
ture, perhaps in the name of Americanism or national
unity, that will be fascism just as in Italy, Germany,
or France.
Fascism is not Mussolini's idea or Hitler's idea. It is
the inevitable result when, instead of facing our acute
social problems and striking at their roots, we attempt
to remove it as one removes a cancerâ€”by steel.
John Weymouth
