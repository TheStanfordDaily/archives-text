# James Hilton Writes Clever New Mystery
## 
### 
"RANDOM HARVEST,'' by James
Hilton, now on sale at the Staf
ford Bookstore.
James Hilton again comes up with
something different—just as his pre
vious novels, "Lost Horizon" and
"Goodbye Mr. Chips" were totally
different from one another — with
"Random Harvest," which departs
from either of the above or from
any previously-tried plot in a book
published so far this season.
Although this is primarily a war
novel, Hilton gets in all his usual
situations and characters, sentiment
and imagination. "Random Harvest"
is the story of a man who has been
badly shot up in the last war, and
whose mind remains a blank from
the time he is wounded in 1917 until
his identity returns in 1919.
Finally remembering who he is, he
returns a stranger to his family. His
father dies and he is forced to take
charge of his worthless family and
his father's business.
NUDGED BY MEMORY
He endures a loveless but most
efficient marriage which furthers
his career. It is at this point when
he is a successful M.P. and the
shadow of the present war is hang
ing over England that he is nudged
by memory to take a night drive to
a certain London suburb. This visit
makes everything concerning the
events of his missing years click
into place.
Hilton puts the main character,
Charles Rainier, on a par with any
other of his famous characters. He
also includes some opinions on the
world situation. Two love affairs
are included but are kept well re
strained. The moralizing at the end
could very well have been ex
cluded.
UPPER CLASS ENGLISH
The description of the upper-class
English family, the dull parasites
whom Rainier is forced to support,
is probably the best piece of work
in the book. This family certainly
had nothing on the one in "The
Little Foxes" for being generally
disgusting.
In this book Hilton has not used
to the full extent the imagery of
"Lost Horizon." Neither has he put
in the sentimentality so effectively
used in "Goodbye Mr. Chips." But
the fascinating story told in "Ran
dom Harvest" raises it above the
general novel class; however, it is
outranked by both of the books
mentioned above!—Wuenschel
