# Refugee to Speak For Luncheoners
## 
### 
Ruth Frankel, refugee from Ger
many, will talk on "Three Chapters
in My Life" this Wednesday at the
Luncheon Club meeting this Wed
nesday noon in the Nitery. Miss
Frankel, who is 28, lived and went to
school during the hectic post war
years before Hitler. She was able to
contrast this brief democratic pe
riod with Nazi Germany.
And now, after two years in
America and the Philippines, Miss
Frankel will contrast her previous
experiences with the third chapter,
life in the United States.
Admission, which includes lunch,
will be 25 cents, as usual.
