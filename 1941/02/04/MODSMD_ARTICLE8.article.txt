# Prix de Paris Contest Winner Discusses Futures in Fashion
## 
### AUDREY STEELE 
A walking formula for success has been on the Stanford campus for
the past four days, in the person of Miss Mae Moon, representative of
Vogue magazine. Dark-haired, piquant and a very charming person in
every sense of the word, Miss Moon chatted yesterday at luncheon with a
group of Stanford women about the furbelows and fun of fashions.

Miss Moon, who was last
winner of Vogue's Prix de Paris
contest for senior college women, is
now in charge of college activities
for the fashion magazine.
Queried about the possibilities
open to women for jobs in fashions
and fashion reporting, 'Miss Moon
averred that if a person had the
talent and the ambition, she saw no
reason why she couldn't succeed.
"What if I hadn't won the con
test, what work would I have gone
into after graduation? Well, you
see, I was an archeology major at
Bryn Mawr, and simply rabid to
play the organ. I really don't know."
FAME PRESCRIPTION
Perhaps that's the ideal prescrip
tion for fame in fashions. Choose
an entirely irrelevant major in col
lege, dote on an avocation and have
enough stamina to feel you have
something to give to the fickle pub
lic. No matter how fantastic it
sounds, it seems to have worked in
Miss Moon's case.
Queried on how Stanford women
differ from the women in eastern
colleges, Miss Moon was quick to
exclaim, "They're not different at
all. All eastern college women feel
that Stanford women are collegiate
sisters."
According to Miss Moon, the
fashion field on the west coast is
very broad and identical in import
ance with that of the East. For ex
ample, Los Angeles, she said, is the
second largest clothing manufactur
ing center in the United States.
Also, Miss Moon feels that San
Francisco women are some of the
best-dressed in the United States,
displaying the bay city'*; cosmopoli
tan taste.
OWN BACKYARD
Miss Moon advised women who
aspire to New York fashion jobs to
tart in their own backyard and do
things startling enough to merit the
attention ol New York bigwigs. She
also mentioned the often-overlooked
possibilities of jobs for women on
trade publications, as department
' tore fashion co-ordinators and in
publicity work.
Miss Moon explained the workings
ol the Vogue contest for senior col
lege women. The possibilities are
wide, she avowed, because even if
you are not a winner, the contact
you have with Vogue will widen
your scope of job opportunities. The
contest offers opportunity for women
interested in both fashions and gen
eral culture reporting.
Arriving in Los Angeles this morn
ing, Miss Moon plans to visit
Scripps, Pomona,-U. S. C. and U. C.
L. A. before returning to New York.
Also included on her five-week
iti>i ,iry were University of Wash-I
inyton, Reed, University of Oregon, 1
and Oregon State.

contest offers opportunity for women
interested in both fashions and gen

Scripps, Pomona,-U. S. C. and U. C.

A walking formula for success has been on the Stanford campus for
the past four days, in the person of Miss Mae Moon, representative of
Vogue magazine. Dark-haired, piquant and a very charming person in
every sense of the word, Miss Moon chatted yesterday at luncheon with a
group of Stanford women about the furbelows and fun of fashions.

Miss Moon, who was last
winner of Vogue's Prix de Paris
contest for senior college women, is
now in charge of college activities
for the fashion magazine.
Queried about the possibilities
open to women for jobs in fashions
and fashion reporting, 'Miss Moon
averred that if a person had the
talent and the ambition, she saw no
reason why she couldn't succeed.
"What if I hadn't won the con
test, what work would I have gone
into after graduation? Well, you
see, I was an archeology major at
Bryn Mawr, and simply rabid to
play the organ. I really don't know."
FAME PRESCRIPTION
Perhaps that's the ideal prescrip
tion for fame in fashions. Choose
an entirely irrelevant major in col
lege, dote on an avocation and have
enough stamina to feel you have
something to give to the fickle pub
lic. No matter how fantastic it
sounds, it seems to have worked in
Miss Moon's case.
Queried on how Stanford women
differ from the women in eastern
colleges, Miss Moon was quick to
exclaim, "They're not different at
all. All eastern college women feel
that Stanford women are collegiate
sisters."
According to Miss Moon, the
fashion field on the west coast is
very broad and identical in import
ance with that of the East. For ex
ample, Los Angeles, she said, is the
second largest clothing manufactur
ing center in the United States.
Also, Miss Moon feels that San
Francisco women are some of the
best-dressed in the United States,
displaying the bay city'*; cosmopoli
tan taste.
OWN BACKYARD
Miss Moon advised women who
aspire to New York fashion jobs to
tart in their own backyard and do
things startling enough to merit the
attention ol New York bigwigs. She
also mentioned the often-overlooked
possibilities of jobs for women on
trade publications, as department
' tore fashion co-ordinators and in
publicity work.
Miss Moon explained the workings
ol the Vogue contest for senior col
