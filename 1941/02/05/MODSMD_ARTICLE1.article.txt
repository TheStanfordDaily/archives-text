### BOB LOW 
YESTERDAY the world was told
that, as a result of the Abetz-
Darlan-Laval conference in Paris,
the 51-day-old "crisis" between
France and Germany was now vir
tually at an end. But, today, France's
chief of state, Henri Philippe Pe
tain, turned thumbs down on the
Hitler-inspired agreement.
It seems that when Admiral Dar
lan presented the demands for pro-
Nazi Laval's reinstatement into the
Vichy government as virtual "man
on horseback," the aged Marshall
called his advisers into an hour and
a half emergency session. Then,
after a 15-minute private confer
ence with Admiral Darlan, he
emerged .to call the demands "pre
tentious" and impossible because of
"military and strategic exigencies."
Among the rumors current in
the United States and England is
a persistent story relating that the
84-year-old Petain is senile, that
he has complete command of his
faculties only in the mornings.
This may or may not be true; but,
if it is, the Marshall must spend his
morning hours being a very clever
statesman indeed. France holds just
one ace in its desperate game with
Hitler, and Petain is handling it
carefully and apparently to good
effect.
* <1 <!
r jPHAT ace is the B'rench fleet—a
fleet virtually intact, and poten
tially very dangerous to the Nazis.
Then, too, General Gamelin, sta
tioned with his army in North Af
rica, is a factor that Hitler must
consider.
General Gamelin, rumored to
dislike the British because it was
through them that Foche and not
himself became commander in
chief of the French armies during
World War I, still is a former
student and great admirer of Pe
tain's.
Thus, the Germans dare not anger
the old Marshal too much. It is true
that they could probably occupy all
of France without much trouble, but
they dare not risk that fleet's falling
into British hands. And the North
African army on the march would
prove no help to Mussolini's already
battered enterprises there.
* * *
THE other hand, Petain's
problem is to keep what is left
of France as free from Nazi domi
nation as he can, without angering
Hitler into a complete occupation.
So the two states, the beaten and
the victor, jockey back and forth,
each trying for what they can get.
Petain has always been bitterly
against any attempt to touch the
fleet or the overseas empire; and
it is probable that Hitler's de
mands, relayed to him through
Abetz and Darlan, must have at
least touched on the sore subject.
When the new agreement is
drawn up (there has not been an
absolute break in the negotiations)
it is probable that these points will
be removed, or at least toned down
so that they can be accepted.
* * Hi
Jy/JEANWIIILE the controversy
raging over America's lend
lease bill showed no signs of letting
up. Now in open debate on the
floor of the House, and being con
sidered at. Senate hearings, the bill
received much pro and con argu
ment yesterday — without, however,
being the subject of such spectacu
lar comment as was caused by Colo
nel Lindbergh's testimony.
President Roosevelt is being ex
tremely guarded in his comments on
the debate and hearings, at pi'esent.
There really is little he needs to say,
since the bill's passage, according to
straw votes taken both in the House
and Senate, is a foregone conclu
sion.

Jy/JEANWIIILE the controversy
raging over America's lend
lease bill showed no signs of letting
up. Now in open debate on the
floor of the House, and being con
sidered at. Senate hearings, the bill
received much pro and con argu
ment yesterday — without, however,
being the subject of such spectacu
lar comment as was caused by Colo
nel Lindbergh's testimony.
President Roosevelt is being ex
tremely guarded in his comments on
the debate and hearings, at pi'esent.
There really is little he needs to say,
since the bill's passage, according to
straw votes taken both in the House
and Senate, is a foregone conclu
sion.
YESTERDAY the world was told
that, as a result of the Abetz-
Darlan-Laval conference in Paris,
the 51-day-old "crisis" between
France and Germany was now vir
tually at an end. But, today, France's
chief of state, Henri Philippe Pe
tain, turned thumbs down on the
Hitler-inspired agreement.
It seems that when Admiral Dar
lan presented the demands for pro-
Nazi Laval's reinstatement into the
Vichy government as virtual "man
on horseback," the aged Marshall
called his advisers into an hour and
a half emergency session. Then,
after a 15-minute private confer
ence with Admiral Darlan, he
emerged .to call the demands "pre
tentious" and impossible because of
"military and strategic exigencies."
Among the rumors current in
the United States and England is
a persistent story relating that the
84-year-old Petain is senile, that
he has complete command of his
faculties only in the mornings.
This may or may not be true; but,
if it is, the Marshall must spend his
morning hours being a very clever
statesman indeed. France holds just
one ace in its desperate game with
Hitler, and Petain is handling it
carefully and apparently to good
effect.
* <1 <!
r jPHAT ace is the B'rench fleet—a
fleet virtually intact, and poten
tially very dangerous to the Nazis.
Then, too, General Gamelin, sta
tioned with his army in North Af
rica, is a factor that Hitler must
consider.
General Gamelin, rumored to
dislike the British because it was
through them that Foche and not
himself became commander in
chief of the French armies during
World War I, still is a former
student and great admirer of Pe
tain's.
Thus, the Germans dare not anger
the old Marshal too much. It is true
that they could probably occupy all
of France without much trouble, but
they dare not risk that fleet's falling
into British hands. And the North
African army on the march would
prove no help to Mussolini's already
battered enterprises there.
* * *
THE other hand, Petain's
problem is to keep what is left
of France as free from Nazi domi
nation as he can, without angering
Hitler into a complete occupation.
So the two states, the beaten and
the victor, jockey back and forth,
each trying for what they can get.
Petain has always been bitterly
against any attempt to touch the
fleet or the overseas empire; and
it is probable that Hitler's de
mands, relayed to him through
Abetz and Darlan, must have at
least touched on the sore subject.
When the new agreement is
drawn up (there has not been an
absolute break in the negotiations)
it is probable that these points will
be removed, or at least toned down
so that they can be accepted.

Hitler into a complete occupation.
So the two states, the beaten and
the victor, jockey back and forth,
each trying for what they can get.
Petain has always been bitterly
against any attempt to touch the
fleet or the overseas empire; and
it is probable that Hitler's de
mands, relayed to him through
Abetz and Darlan, must have at
least touched on the sore subject.
When the new agreement is
drawn up (there has not been an
absolute break in the negotiations)
it is probable that these points will
be removed, or at least toned down
so that they can be accepted.
* * Hi
Jy/JEANWIIILE the controversy
raging over America's lend
lease bill showed no signs of letting
up. Now in open debate on the
floor of the House, and being con
sidered at. Senate hearings, the bill
received much pro and con argu
ment yesterday — without, however,
being the subject of such spectacu
lar comment as was caused by Colo
nel Lindbergh's testimony.
President Roosevelt is being ex
tremely guarded in his comments on
the debate and hearings, at pi'esent.
There really is little he needs to say,
since the bill's passage, according to
straw votes taken both in the House
and Senate, is a foregone conclu
sion.
