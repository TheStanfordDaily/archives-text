# Excom Plans for Sale of 200 Extra Tickets to Hawkins Hop
## 
### 
And now they're wondering what to do with the % Daisy Maes who
are on the waiting list for the Sadies Hawkins Hop!
The administration has given the official "nay" to the proposition that
both sides of the gym he opened. The reasoning behind this turn-down
is sound, according to Bruce Jessup, who yesterday said that having an-

other dance on the recently redone
floor would necessitate a whole new
floor being laid.
"And we can't take on that ex
pense," he said.
LI'L ABNEKS SAD
"But my little Abner'll be so dis
appointed," wailed one co-ed.
In answer to this well-worn senti
ment, the A.S.S.U. offers the pros
pect of waxing the patio bricks,
turning the 600 couples lose in the

available space, and hoping for the
best.
The 500 th bid to the dance was
sold to a breathless potential Daisy
Mae at 11:30 o'clock Monday morn
ing. Since then Farm women have
beseiged the A.S.S.U. office fran
tically waving $1.97 through the
office window.
STEPP FORLORN
Dick Stepp, student manager,
who hopes to make a dent in the
Boathouse deficit as a result of the
dance, wanders about the office for
lorn and crushed. If tickets can be
sold to the 96 on the waiting list
$189.12 will pour into the A.S.S.U.
treasury and no student manager
likes to see a prospect like that slip
by.
Stepp has even considered open
ing Memorial Hall for the Hop, us
ing the stage as a dance floor. This
hope was defeated yesterday when
it was discovered that there was no
more room in the Theater than in
the Gym.
