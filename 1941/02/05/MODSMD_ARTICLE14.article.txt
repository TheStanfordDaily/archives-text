# EXCOM BRAINCHILD TRAPS 'BRAINS'
## 
### 
Activity Card Files, brain child of
Ex Committee, last week caught up
with Anne Townsend, A.S.S.U. vice
president, and Ross Anderson, Ex
corn's member-at-large. After thus
far successfully evading the files
draft, they were cornered by Card
Files co-chairmen Betty Avery and
Phil Rosenthal.

At Excom's regular meeting Card
Files' heads were called on to report
the progress of their work. It was

They were signed and catalogued on

The women's section of the Card
Files is now completely filed and
cross-filed, according to Betty Av
ery.
