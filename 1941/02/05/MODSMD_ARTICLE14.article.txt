# EXCOM BRAINCHILD TRAPS 'BRAINS'
## 
### 
Activity Card Files, brain child of
Ex Committee, last week caught up
with Anne Townsend, A.S.S.U. vice
president, and Ross Anderson, Ex
corn's member-at-large. After thus
far successfully evading the files
draft, they were cornered by Card
Files co-chairmen Betty Avery and
Phil Rosenthal.

son, Hotly Avery, Phil Rosenthal,

At Excom's regular meeting Card
Files' heads were called on to report
the progress of their work. It was
discovered that neither Anne Town
send nor Anderson had filed cards.
They were signed and catalogued on
the spot.
The women's section of the Card
Files is now completely filed and
cross-filed, according to Betty Av
ery.
Progress has also been made in

the filing of men's activities. Cards
have been sent out to all men
through Interfraternity Council, In
terclub Council, and the men spon
sors. The committee expects to
have the returned cards filed very
shortly, according to Fhil Rosenthal.
Early next week Card Files' heads
plan to meet with the four class
presidents, and the chairmen of
Cardinals and Axe Society to ac
quaint them with the completed files
and emphasize that all future ap
pointments must be made through
Files Committee.
All students who have not yet
filed activity cards and who are in
terested in committee work should
do so at once.
"The aim of the files is to give
everyone who is interested in activ
ity work an opportunity, and to
create a more democratic system of
selection. We hope to establish this
organisation so that it will become
a permanent and a routine matter,"
Rosenthal said.
