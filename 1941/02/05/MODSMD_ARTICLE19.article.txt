# Astronomer Tells Audience Of Sun Spots
## 
### 
Comparing rainfall, tree growth,
and radio reception on the earth
with the occurrence of sun spots,
Dr. Ilarlan True Stetson, promi
nent lecturer and authority on as
tronomy, spoke to the Tuesday
Series followers last night on "The
Sun and Its Influence on Human
AlTairs."
"Hurricanes which are experi
ences in the Caribbean region can
be compared to the sun spots," Dr.
Stetson pointed out. "The sun is
about one million times the size of
the earth, and the sun spots are
about one million times the size of
the hurricanes."
ANALYZE TREK RINGS
He described how scientists have
connected the past sun spots with
happenings on the earth by analy
sis of tree rings. For a time these
investigators had trouble connect
ing the period from the last part of
the 17th century and the beginning
of the 18th century with foregoing
times, but to their relief they found
that no record had been kept during
that time.
This discovery added confidence
to the investigations, and the study
of tree rings and their connection
with sun spots has continued.
SEES CONNECTIONS
"There was a sunspot peak in
1928 and a stock market peak in
1929," Dr. Stetson remarked. "The
spots started decreasing before the
market crash. The market touched
bottom in 1932, the spots in 1933.
Since then both have risen." This
may be coincidence.
Dr. Stetson definitely believes that
there are connections between this
solar phenomenon and activity on
the earth. We may be able to pre
dict future events by the perfection
of the science of observation of sun
spots, according to Dr. Stetson.
