# CAMPUS SMASH
## 
### 
Last night at 10:30 o'clock a Ford
coupe driven down the Row by Ray
Watson collided with another Ford
coupe piloted by Miss Gloria Green
back, who was traveling east on
Santa Ynoz. The impact caused
Watson's car to completely reverse
its direction. Watson suffered a cut
on the knee and was taken to the
hospital by friends for treatment.
