### 
LONDON, Wed., Feb. 5 (LP). —Waves of German raiders swept over
England and Wales last night and early today, lighting machine gun
battles in the skies with British lighter planes in the luftwaffe's most
extensive night time attack in weeks.
The attacks extended from the Scottish border down through London,

the Midlands, Wales and southwest
England but nowhere did they ap
pear to have approached "blitz" in
tensity.
Several relays of Nazi planes
crossed the eastern industrial sec
tion of the Midlands, where two
bombs fell on one town. The noise
of machine guns could be heard.
ALL CLEAR SOON
German planes came over London
but an "all clear" signal sounded
about 11 p.m. In a town of north
west England three persons were
killed when a bomb demolished
their home. Liverpool, the West
Midlands, a northeastern town, the
Thames Estuary, and southwest Eng
land also reported attacks.
The weather was fine Tuesday
over the Channel and for the first
time in many days it was possible
to see the cliffs between Calais
and Boulogne, now capped with
snow.
BOMB STARTS FIRES
A town on the Thames Estuary
reported a high explosive bomb fell
in its main street, near a theater,
blasting shops, offices and a hotel but
failing to stop a variety show at the
theater. It was feared there was a
number of casualties. Several fires
were started but quickly extin
guished.
