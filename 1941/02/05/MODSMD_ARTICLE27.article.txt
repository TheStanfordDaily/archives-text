Set a date hi' some time next year and that's when we'll he in the war.
This prediction was made hy Dr. John B. Canning, professor of eco
nomics, in an interview yesterday.
"And ? think that's the way we ought to go. This is our war," the

noted economist added. <
Dr. Canning qualified his first
statement, however, with the stipu
lation that Britain must hold out
until we are actually able to partici

measure, similar to the one used in
the last war, through which the
United States and England will cor

war materials.
