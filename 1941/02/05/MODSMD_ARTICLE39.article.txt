# Cagers Prep Under Sword Of Blue-Gold 'Flying Five'
## Friday Night Tilt May Determine Future Pacific Coast Champions 
### DON SELBY 
Full of the old popper despite their unexpected defeat at the hands
of U.C.L.A. last Saturday night, Stanford's cagers started putting on the
pressure yesterday for their meeting this Friday night with the University
of California Bears in the Pavilion.
In most of the other conference games they have played, the Indians

have had a little margin to work
on. That is, after the first series
with S.C., they were not in danger
of losing their leadership in any
single game. But they are no longer
in that position, for a win by Cal
Friday night would send the Indians
and Bears into a tie for the top
spot.
For the first time in many a moon,
the University of Southern Califor
nia is not slated to be in one of the
tap two positions in the standings
of the Southern Division of the Pa
cific Coast Conference. Of course,
the Trojans can still move up, for
the first half of the four-game round
robin conference schedule has not
yet been played through.
But the way that both the Indians
and the Bears handed U.S.C. four
straight setbacks doesn't speak well
for the Trojans' chances to make a
comeback.
WHO WILL TOP?
Perhaps this is just Stanford's and
California's year to outclass the
southerners. Assuming that, the big
question is still unsettled. Just who
—Stanford or California—is going 1o
have the best of the northern Cali
fornia cage teams?
So far the Indians have the edge
with a full-game lead over their
traditional rivals from across the
bay. But the rough time that the
Bears gave Stanford before bowing
to the Indians in the first contest of
the Big Game series, plus the man
ner in which they knocked over
U.S.C. point to a great California
quintet — one that will play plenty
of hot basketball before being de
feated by any Coast team.
OFF THEIR GAME
Stanford, however, was off its
game in the last fray with the Bears,
while Cal was playing one of its
best games. The Indians, when play
ing their top basketball, have the
class to take the Bears to the
cleaners.
But a Stanford team that waits
until the second half to turn on the
heat—as was the case in both games
against U.C.L.A.—is very likely to
find itself decidedly in arrears of
five flying Bears.
We've said it before and we'll say
it again. The Southern Division of
the P.C.C. is a plenty tough league
to play ball in. And no one is
realizing that fact more these days
than each Stanford basketballer and
Coach Everett Dean.
