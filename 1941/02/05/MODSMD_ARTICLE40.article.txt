# Mermen to Face Y.M.C.A. in City
## 
### 
Stanford's powerful varsity swim
ming team will meet one of its
strongest opponents when they face
the Central Y.M.C.A. of San Fran
cisco iu the city next Saturday night
at 8:!50 o'clock. In a recent meet
against San .Jose State the Sea
Horses demonstrated the fact that
(hey have one of the strongest teams
(in the West Coast.
The "Y" has one of the greatest
groups of sprint stars ever assembled
under ono banner. With the excep
tion of the great Roy Vitousek.
there is no Stanford man capable of
winning an event in the shorter dis
tances, and even Vitousek may have
some trouble with the "Y's" new
find, Bill Hickey.
The outcome of the meet will
probably be decided by the finish
of the 400-yard relay, the last event
of the program. It is hoped that the
Indians will splash their way to vic
tory in this event and give them a
slight margin in the meet.
