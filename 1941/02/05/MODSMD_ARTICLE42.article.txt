# Stanford Nine To Oppose Big League Players
## 
### 
Here for a return engagement,
Gaddini's All-Stars tackle Stan
ford's baseball squad today on
Sunken Diamond at 3:15 o'clock. A
week ago the Card nine rapped the
Stars, 5-2, hut today Gaddini's line
up may he bolstered by a couple of
big leaguers—possibly Babe Dal
ghren of the New York Yankees and
Jce Orengo, bought by the New
York Giants this year.
Dalghren played here Monday for
Kenneally's Seals and cavorted
around the initial sack in great
style, giving the paltry 40 or 50 fans
a pretty good exhibition for a man
who is supposed to be out of shape.
Sam Chapman, hard-hitting out
fielder of the Philadelphia Athletics
will probably be on hand in center
field along with another Philadel
phian, second baseman Dario Lodi
giani.
HAVE WON THREE
Back to the local nine — Coach
Harry Wolter's aggregation has won
three out of four encounters, its
only loss being to Kenneally's two
days ago, 4-3.
No one can doubt that the In
dians aren't playing real ball clubs
in this siege of practice contests, for
men like Dahlgren, Lodigiani, Chap
man, Ted Jennings, and Orengo—all
of whom have played here this sea
son — are professional players and
any team that can play on par with
these sluggers must be rated pretty
high.
INFIELD SMOOTHER
Work around the infield was
smoother Monday than it has been.
Shortstop Monty Pfyl, for one, rob
bed Dalghren of two sure base
jknocks as He took care of the
Yankee first baseman's two light
ning grounders and turned them
into easy outs.
Wolter hasn't attempted to let one
pitcher go the route yet, his four
mound.smen, Phil Wolf, Claude Pur
kitt, A1 Smith, and Cootie Thomp
son all taking a turn on the hill
against Kenneally's.
NO LINE-UP YET
The Stanford coach hasn't re
leased his starting batteries yet, but
taking a guess at it would put
Thompson on the mound and Ace
Hanlon behind the plate.
(The following line-ups are sub
ject to last-minute change. Gad
dini's is as it appeared when the
All-Stars played here a week ago
without Dalghren and Orengo.)
