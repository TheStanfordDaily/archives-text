# VIGH WILL 'CROWN'
## 
### 
Ernie Vigh, the upstate farm boy
who has developed into a Metro
politan crowd-pleaser by virtue of
his yen for action and leather throw
ing style from gong to gong, said
today that he would "crown" Billy
Sose in no uncertain terms in their
middleweight tilt this Friday night.
The robustly built Ernie who has
36 knockouts to his credit bases his
claims on the fact that he has
sparred with Sose and found him
weak in the body. He will weigh in
at 159 pounds for Sose, just one
under the 160-pound limit.
