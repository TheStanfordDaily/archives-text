AT the risk of being highly repetitive, The
Daily again pleads with Stanford men and
women to nominate candidates for member-at
large on the Board of Athletic Control who are
neither athletes nor physical education majors.
The best representatives that the student
body can elect will be those who are completely
free from any implied or suggested coercion,
who may vote as average undergraduates on
Board policies. It is not the intention of this
writer to imply that any external pressure is
ever brought on scholarship-holders or physi
cal education majors, who are dependent upon
certain members of the Eoard, but an unspoken
and implied censorship cannot help but exist.
To eliminate any embarrassing circumstances,
it will be infinitely more satisfactory for Stan
ford undergraduates if they elect a non-major
and non-athlete to the B.A.C.
The Daily will actively support such a man
for the office.
