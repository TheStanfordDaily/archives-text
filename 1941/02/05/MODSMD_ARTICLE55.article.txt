IT might not be a violation of the fire laws,
but it may be plenty uncomfortable—those
1,400 people in one small room on Friday night.
Ex Committee decided last night to "accom
modate" the 100 eager women on the waiting
list by selling them, together with almost any
one else who drops by the A..SS.U. office this
afternoon, tickets for the Sadie Hawkins dance.
By "accommodating" a couple of hundred
people who just didn't buy their bids early
enough, Excom stands in order to inconvenience
the other thousand who have already reserved
their one square foot of floor space in the dinky
Women's Gym.
Excom didn't legislate into existence any ad
ditional room for the new arrivals, except sug
gesting that maybe they can dance in the patio.
Brother, this isn't spring. And, brother, these
aren't June nights.
This little episode is just another variation on
the old nursery rhyme about the people who
killed that goose who laid the golden eggs. If
sponsors of the 1942 edition of the Sadie Haw
kins dance wonder why it doesn't go over with
a bang-bang, they can only look back to this
year's spectacle of 1,400 people in one room—
and remember those sore toes.
