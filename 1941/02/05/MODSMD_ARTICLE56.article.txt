# The 						Crooked Mind

### 
LOGICIANS point out that a favorite trick of
a person engaging in invalid argument is
to take his opponent's proposition and change
it so that he himself is arguing on more familiar
ground while his adversary is at the disadvan
tage of disputing in territory that he had not
anticipated in his opening proposition.
In other words, by diverting the argument
the fallacious reasoner can seem to completely
undermine his opponent's dissertation. Actu
ally, though, he is only arguing on a point his
opponent had never introduced. This trick,
utilized either consciously or unconsciously, is
called "diversion" by logicians, and is known
as a prime factor in unsound reasoning.
A perfect example of diversion is presented
in one of today's Campus Opinions. Probably
it is an unintentional violation of sound thinking
in this case, but the fact remains that the writer
attempts to clinch his case by a diversion.
First of all, he claims that The Daily's recent
poll, which showed that 74 per cent of Stan
ford's students favored the Lend-Lease Bill, is
inaccurate. He diverts the argument from a
question of accuracy to one of emotion in which
he says that President Roosevelt's foreign pol
icy is favored only by the "loud little hand
ful." He goes on to say that he refuses to be
lieve that people are foolish enough to destroy
their own country (ostensibly by favoring the
Lend-Lease Bill), and then attempts to disprove
the accuracy of the poll on the grounds of his
personal emotions in the matter.
This is an interesting little example of
crooked thinking. We do not begrudge the
writer of the Campus Opinion his belief that
Communism is the root evil of the whole situ
ation. We have no idea of how accurate his
figures are relative to the 30.000,000 persons
"murdered" in Russia.

But we begrudge his opinion that The Daily's
poll is inaccurate merely because its results do
not fit in with his emotional findings. The
Daily's poll is a product of scientific research
conducted by experts. It was not formulated
by one of the student members of the paper.
It so happens that Dr. George Gallup's na
tion-wide cross-index has shown that a majority
of the nation as a whole also favors the Lend-
Lease Bill. It is a courageous man who would
doubt the accuracy of the Gallup poll.
Obviously, then, the Lend-Lease Bill is fa
vored by more than the "loud little handful." As
a matter of fact, the number of persons opposing
it constitutes a much smaller handful. They
are entitled to their "loudness." But, all things
being equal, one who denies scientific fact and
substitutes for it personal reactions must neces
sarily be louder than the majority.
The plea cannot be made too many times, in
these days of stress, for people to keep their
thinking straight. And few persons would agree
that straight reasoning consists of denying your
adversary's argument, particularly when it is
well substantiated, and substituting personal
opinion. There's too much of that these days.

Obviously, then, the Lend-Lease Bill is fa
vored by more than the "loud little handful." As
a matter of fact, the number of persons opposing
it constitutes a much smaller handful. They
are entitled to their "loudness." But, all things
being equal, one who denies scientific fact and
substitutes for it personal reactions must neces
sarily be louder than the majority.
The plea cannot be made too many times, in
these days of stress, for people to keep their
thinking straight. And few persons would agree
that straight reasoning consists of denying your
adversary's argument, particularly when it is
well substantiated, and substituting personal
opinion. There's too much of that these days.

LOGICIANS point out that a favorite trick of
a person engaging in invalid argument is
to take his opponent's proposition and change
it so that he himself is arguing on more familiar
ground while his adversary is at the disadvan
tage of disputing in territory that he had not
anticipated in his opening proposition.
In other words, by diverting the argument
the fallacious reasoner can seem to completely
undermine his opponent's dissertation. Actu
ally, though, he is only arguing on a point his
opponent had never introduced. This trick,
utilized either consciously or unconsciously, is
called "diversion" by logicians, and is known
as a prime factor in unsound reasoning.
A perfect example of diversion is presented
in one of today's Campus Opinions. Probably
it is an unintentional violation of sound thinking
in this case, but the fact remains that the writer
attempts to clinch his case by a diversion.
First of all, he claims that The Daily's recent
poll, which showed that 74 per cent of Stan
ford's students favored the Lend-Lease Bill, is
inaccurate. He diverts the argument from a
question of accuracy to one of emotion in which
he says that President Roosevelt's foreign pol
icy is favored only by the "loud little hand
ful." He goes on to say that he refuses to be
lieve that people are foolish enough to destroy
their own country (ostensibly by favoring the
Lend-Lease Bill), and then attempts to disprove
the accuracy of the poll on the grounds of his
personal emotions in the matter.
This is an interesting little example of
crooked thinking. We do not begrudge the
writer of the Campus Opinion his belief that
Communism is the root evil of the whole situ
ation. We have no idea of how accurate his
figures are relative to the 30.000,000 persons
"murdered" in Russia.

But we begrudge his opinion that The Daily's
poll is inaccurate merely because its results do
not fit in with his emotional findings. The
Daily's poll is a product of scientific research
conducted by experts. It was not formulated
by one of the student members of the paper.
It so happens that Dr. George Gallup's na
tion-wide cross-index has shown that a majority
of the nation as a whole also favors the Lend-
Lease Bill. It is a courageous man who would
doubt the accuracy of the Gallup poll.
Obviously, then, the Lend-Lease Bill is fa
vored by more than the "loud little handful." As
a matter of fact, the number of persons opposing
it constitutes a much smaller handful. They
are entitled to their "loudness." But, all things
