### BUD AMES 
IF YOU MUST DRINK. STAY HOME
start this whole tete-a-tete off today by back
ing into the situation. Most of you will admit that
Princeton is a solidy, granitey university. It has lots
of ivy all over the walls, hundreds of those traditional
crop-haircuts, and, oh, just the usual run of wholesome
traditions.
And their traditions are really traditions since the
date on their label reads 1747, which doesn't exactly
make them fresh.
Now, in view of these facts, you would be inclined
to think that such a university would, through force
of habit if for no other reason, tend to the straight
and narrow, to that which has been dragging on
through almost two centuries.

A ND yet, Princeton, never to be outdone by all the
rest of us cow colleges in this land of life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness, yesterday pulled a sen
sational rare-bit out of their hat—undoubtedly a pork
pie—by breaking tradition.
Yesterday, the Princetonian overlords went on rec
ord to the effect that, henceforth and hereafter, liquor
WILL be permitted in the students' rooms.
Now there is something.
And who made the announcement? Why, their
Dean of Men, Christian Gauss, of course.
And in place of the old regulation set down in
1747 which ruled suspension or expulsion to any stu
dent found having liquor in his room, the trustees
substituted a regulation making "intoxication or dis
order and bad manners arising from the use of liquor"
subject to the same penalties.
* * * *
PRECEDENT—of the most startling nature —has
been established. The obvious thing at this time,
in the glowing light of this precedent, would be to
suggest a similar campaign in your Farm newspaper
along the same lines.
After all, the change at Princeton came as the di
rect, the directest of direct, result of a campaign which
was created, begun, and carried to the desired goal by
The Daily Princeton, which is comparable to this rag—
to put it bluntly.
But somehow, a certain campaign titled "These
Places Serve Liquor to Minors" back a couple of years
ago brought nothing but unfavorable comment. And
much of it by you students.
And though this may seem like an avoiding reac
tion to those who revel in and plead for much blood
spilt by the journalistic fiery sword, now is hardly the
time for all good men and all good women to come
to the aid of the cause—even if you wanted to.
This is Stanford's fiftieth anniversary. We are
nearing the end of this volume of The Daily. Next year
we are changing presidents. Oh. you can go on for
quite some time fingering off similar reasons. Perhaps,
like Princeton, we will have to wait 193 years.
Yet, let's not forget what has gone by the boards
back East. They have met an actuality, they have
faced it, and handled it very well. You can't get
around the fact that traces of a similar problem exist
in the West as well. Let's not stick our heads in the
sand like so many ostriches. Princeton's point is well
taken.
Their action brings back a mother's kindly advice.
"If you feel you have to drink, for heaven's sake
please come home where you can do it the right way,
in a gentlemanly fashion. I will be glad to give you a
drink under those circumstances."

rect, the directest of direct, result of a campaign which
was created, begun, and carried to the desired goal by
The Daily Princeton, which is comparable to this rag—
to put it bluntly.
But somehow, a certain campaign titled "These
Places Serve Liquor to Minors" back a couple of years
ago brought nothing but unfavorable comment. And
much of it by you students.
And though this may seem like an avoiding reac
tion to those who revel in and plead for much blood
spilt by the journalistic fiery sword, now is hardly the
time for all good men and all good women to come
to the aid of the cause—even if you wanted to.
This is Stanford's fiftieth anniversary. We are
nearing the end of this volume of The Daily. Next year
we are changing presidents. Oh. you can go on for
quite some time fingering off similar reasons. Perhaps,
like Princeton, we will have to wait 193 years.
Yet, let's not forget what has gone by the boards
back East. They have met an actuality, they have
faced it, and handled it very well. You can't get
around the fact that traces of a similar problem exist
in the West as well. Let's not stick our heads in the
sand like so many ostriches. Princeton's point is well
taken.
Their action brings back a mother's kindly advice.
"If you feel you have to drink, for heaven's sake
please come home where you can do it the right way,
in a gentlemanly fashion. I will be glad to give you a
drink under those circumstances."
IF YOU MUST DRINK. STAY HOME
start this whole tete-a-tete off today by back
ing into the situation. Most of you will admit that
Princeton is a solidy, granitey university. It has lots
of ivy all over the walls, hundreds of those traditional
crop-haircuts, and, oh, just the usual run of wholesome
traditions.
And their traditions are really traditions since the
date on their label reads 1747, which doesn't exactly
make them fresh.
Now, in view of these facts, you would be inclined
to think that such a university would, through force
of habit if for no other reason, tend to the straight
and narrow, to that which has been dragging on
through almost two centuries.

A ND yet, Princeton, never to be outdone by all the
rest of us cow colleges in this land of life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness, yesterday pulled a sen
sational rare-bit out of their hat—undoubtedly a pork
pie—by breaking tradition.
Yesterday, the Princetonian overlords went on rec
ord to the effect that, henceforth and hereafter, liquor
WILL be permitted in the students' rooms.
Now there is something.
And who made the announcement? Why, their
Dean of Men, Christian Gauss, of course.
And in place of the old regulation set down in
1747 which ruled suspension or expulsion to any stu
dent found having liquor in his room, the trustees
substituted a regulation making "intoxication or dis
order and bad manners arising from the use of liquor"
subject to the same penalties.

PRECEDENT—of the most startling nature —has
