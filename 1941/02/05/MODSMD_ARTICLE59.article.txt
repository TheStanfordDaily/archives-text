# 'LOUD LITTLE HANDFUL'
## 
### 
HPHE EDITOR, SIR:
Bud Ames makes tlie statement in his column
that 74 per cent of the students approve of the lease
lend bill. I question the accuracy of this poll, which
was taken by Herm Silverman.
The bill gives the President power to give away the
wealth and the means of defense of the nation, which
of course is what he has indicated that he wants to
do. Those who favor measures of this sort are the
same "loud little handful" who got us into the last
war against the interests and best judgment of the
country as a whole. *
Fascism and National Socialism arose in Italy and
Germany in order to avert Communism. Therefore
Communists all over the world have endeavored to
bring a hostile coalition against these countries. Yet
the Communist rulers of Russia, having murdered
thirty million (30.000,000) individuals in their own
country, dare not bring Russia into the war for fear
of a revolt.
Instead, the other nations of the world are en
. couraged to destroy each other so that the rulers of
Russia will reign supreme.
If most, of the people are in favor of destroying
their own country in order to make the world safe
for Communism, they are certainly foolish. But I
refuse to believe that most of us are so foolish. In my
opinion, those dragging us into war are merely the
"loud little handful" of professional agitators.
