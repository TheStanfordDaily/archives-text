# LION OF JUDAH GETS HIS REVENGE
## 
### 

A VALUABLE ALLY to the British is Hailc Selassie, the "Conquering Lion of Judah," who is shown at
left with British officers inspecting Ethiopian troops armed with British guns. The ex-Emperor of Ethiopia
is back in his country, stirring revolt, and planning revenge on the Italians, who used tanks and planes to
defeat his tribesmen in 1935.
