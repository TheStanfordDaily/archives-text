# Thomas Wolfe Rings Bell In Autobiographical Novel
## 
### 
"YOU CAN'T GO HOME AGAIN," by Thomas Wolfe.
It took Thomas Wolfe quite a while to work up to the book that he
was clearly capable of writing, but he finally made it with "You Can't Go
Home Again." his third posthumously-published novel.
Adhering to the principle which he voices through his author-hero—

that a writer can make a good
only from personal experience —
Wolfe's plot is almost entirely auto
biographical.
It's all about a young author,
George Webber, and his not alto
gether steady rise to success. As a
clinical study of the psychological
development of a talented, but still
fairly normal man, "You Can't Go
Home Again" is consistently well
written.
DIFFERENT CHARACTERS
But the most interesting parts of
the book are those which deal with
the people Webber runs across —
none of them stereotyped characters,
yet all of them convincingly nat
ural. There's something about the
little Oriental, Mr. Katamoto, with
his friendly giggle, and the waiter
with a yen to write the great Arme
nian novel that leaves you with a
nice feeling about the brotherhood
of man.
By far the most amazing person in
the well-populated book is Lloyd
McHarg, a successful writer with
eccentric habits.
WHY, THAT'S ME
So remarkable was this charac
terization that several self-conscious
authors have publicly pronounced
their not-too-indignant ire at be
ing put into "You Can't Go Home
Again."
The book ends in rather weak at
tempt at self-explanation, which is
too old a trick to have very much
potency left.
The narrative had told so much
about Webber that it was anti-cli
mactic to have everything explained
in words of ten syllables.
In spite of that, it's a good book—
Wolfe in his clearest and most lucid
style.—Campbell
