J7RANCE can't win.
That is the probable simple an
swer to the fight being waged for
control of the French people by
Henri Petain and Pierre Laval.
Last June when the French armies
were crushed, the Germans imposed
upon France not an unjust peace
but merely an almost meaningless
armistice.
The German army occupied most
of France, that is the land inhab
ited by all but 8 million continental
Fienchmen. The Germans kept 2
million prisoners of war as hostages
and immediately set these men to
W' .k within their own war econ
omy.
The coasts of France bordering
the Straits of Dover and the Atlantic
were seized for submarine bases and
other preparations for invasion of
the British Isles. And the Germans
at the same time made certain that
•i through railroad under their con
trol connected the rich mercury
mines of Spain with the industries
of the Greater Reich.
Within the unoccupied territory,
France was permitted to erect a gov
ernment — subsequently called the
Vichy government. It was to be the
organ of the French people to ar
range terms of peace and lead in
the reconstruction of France. From
the outset, this government, a dic
tatorship under Marshal Petain, at
tempted to maintain its dignity as a
representative organ of Frenchmen
everywhere and not submit to the
Nazi domination which seemed in
evitable when the actual fighting
stopped in June.
* * *
B" T there have been those in
France who desired full col
laboration with the Nazis.
Laval first was given tlie post
of vice-premier and then relieved
of his duties when his pro-Nazi
sympathies became obnoxious to
Petain and the men about him.
Laval in the minds of most
Frenchmen soon became the sym
bol of appeasement, the symbol
of appeasement, the symbol of
humiliation, the traitor of France.
Today, with backing from a small
part of the French people—which
the United Press correspondent es
timates as low as 1 per cent—and
with the support of Nazi government
spokesmen in occupied France, this
man is attempting to take over the
French nation.
If Petain is forced to submit to
Laval's demands, it may be expect
ed that France under a military dic
tatorship will become a satellite of
Germany with all the characteristics
of the "mother" country.
If Petain refuses Laval's demands
for power, it is possible German
troops will occupy all France and
wipe out any semblance of a
French government.
Reports from Europe yesterday
indicated Petain had undertaken
to follow a compromise path—re
sign and appoint Admiral Fran
cois Darlan head of the govern
ment.
* * *
B UT the most optimistic observ
ers look upon the appointment
of Darlan as no better than a stop
gap move, for the feud between La
val and Petain will go on. And the
feud between these two is rapidly
becoming a fight between Laval and
the French people.
Press reports yesterday from ob
servers both in Paris and in Vichy
reflect this situation. Petain, these
dispatches say, is the symbol of "re
constructed France," the only man
with any popular following.
Laval, at his office in Paris, is said
to receive hundreds of threatening
letters a week and according to re
ports in Vichy "would have trouble
mustering 1 per cent" of the people
behind him if he gained control of
the government.
But Laval is supported by the
Nazi armed fist.
Yesterday a German propaganda
broadcast to France from Stuttgart
warned:
"Remember, there is only an ar
mistice between Germany and
France and peace has not yet been
established. If the position changes
for the worse, Germany will be
obliged to require securities from
France and impose much more se
vere peace terms. France is warned."

of vice-premier and then relieved
of his duties when his pro-Nazi
sympathies became obnoxious to
Petain and the men about him.
Laval in the minds of most
Frenchmen soon became the sym
bol of appeasement, the symbol
of appeasement, the symbol of
humiliation, the traitor of France.
Today, with backing from a small
part of the French people—which
the United Press correspondent es
timates as low as 1 per cent—and
with the support of Nazi government
spokesmen in occupied France, this
man is attempting to take over the
French nation.
If Petain is forced to submit to
Laval's demands, it may be expect
ed that France under a military dic
tatorship will become a satellite of
Germany with all the characteristics
of the "mother" country.
If Petain refuses Laval's demands
for power, it is possible German
troops will occupy all France and
wipe out any semblance of a
French government.
Reports from Europe yesterday
indicated Petain had undertaken
to follow a compromise path—re
sign and appoint Admiral Fran
cois Darlan head of the govern
ment.
* * *
B UT the most optimistic observ
ers look upon the appointment
of Darlan as no better than a stop
gap move, for the feud between La
val and Petain will go on. And the
feud between these two is rapidly
becoming a fight between Laval and
the French people.
Press reports yesterday from ob
servers both in Paris and in Vichy
reflect this situation. Petain, these
dispatches say, is the symbol of "re
constructed France," the only man
with any popular following.
Laval, at his office in Paris, is said
to receive hundreds of threatening
letters a week and according to re
ports in Vichy "would have trouble
mustering 1 per cent" of the people
behind him if he gained control of
the government.
But Laval is supported by the
Nazi armed fist.
Yesterday a German propaganda
broadcast to France from Stuttgart
warned:
"Remember, there is only an ar
mistice between Germany and
France and peace has not yet been
established. If the position changes
for the worse, Germany will be
obliged to require securities from
France and impose much more se
vere peace terms. France is warned."
J7RANCE can't win.
That is the probable simple an
swer to the fight being waged for
control of the French people by
Henri Petain and Pierre Laval.
Last June when the French armies
were crushed, the Germans imposed
upon France not an unjust peace
but merely an almost meaningless
armistice.
The German army occupied most
of France, that is the land inhab
ited by all but 8 million continental
Fienchmen. The Germans kept 2
million prisoners of war as hostages
and immediately set these men to
W' .k within their own war econ
omy.
The coasts of France bordering
the Straits of Dover and the Atlantic
were seized for submarine bases and
other preparations for invasion of
the British Isles. And the Germans
at the same time made certain that
•i through railroad under their con
trol connected the rich mercury
mines of Spain with the industries
of the Greater Reich.
Within the unoccupied territory,
France was permitted to erect a gov
ernment — subsequently called the
Vichy government. It was to be the
organ of the French people to ar
range terms of peace and lead in
the reconstruction of France. From
the outset, this government, a dic
tatorship under Marshal Petain, at

representative organ of Frenchmen
everywhere and not submit to the
Nazi domination which seemed in

with any popular following.
Laval, at his office in Paris, is said
to receive hundreds of threatening
letters a week and according to re
ports in Vichy "would have trouble
mustering 1 per cent" of the people
behind him if he gained control of
the government.
But Laval is supported by the
Nazi armed fist.
Yesterday a German propaganda
broadcast to France from Stuttgart
warned:
"Remember, there is only an ar
mistice between Germany and
France and peace has not yet been
established. If the position changes
for the worse, Germany will be
obliged to require securities from
France and impose much more se
vere peace terms. France is warned."
J7RANCE can't win.
That is the probable simple an
swer to the fight being waged for
control of the French people by
Henri Petain and Pierre Laval.
Last June when the French armies
were crushed, the Germans imposed
upon France not an unjust peace
but merely an almost meaningless
armistice.
The German army occupied most
of France, that is the land inhab
ited by all but 8 million continental
Fienchmen. The Germans kept 2
million prisoners of war as hostages
and immediately set these men to
W' .k within their own war econ
omy.
The coasts of France bordering
the Straits of Dover and the Atlantic
were seized for submarine bases and
other preparations for invasion of
the British Isles. And the Germans
at the same time made certain that
•i through railroad under their con
trol connected the rich mercury
mines of Spain with the industries
of the Greater Reich.
Within the unoccupied territory,
France was permitted to erect a gov
ernment — subsequently called the
Vichy government. It was to be the
organ of the French people to ar
range terms of peace and lead in
the reconstruction of France. From
the outset, this government, a dic
tatorship under Marshal Petain, at
tempted to maintain its dignity as a
representative organ of Frenchmen
everywhere and not submit to the
Nazi domination which seemed in
evitable when the actual fighting
stopped in June.
* * *
B" T there have been those in
France who desired full col
laboration with the Nazis.
Laval first was given tlie post
of vice-premier and then relieved
of his duties when his pro-Nazi
sympathies became obnoxious to
Petain and the men about him.
Laval in the minds of most
Frenchmen soon became the sym
bol of appeasement, the symbol
of appeasement, the symbol of
humiliation, the traitor of France.
Today, with backing from a small
part of the French people—which
the United Press correspondent es
timates as low as 1 per cent—and
with the support of Nazi government
spokesmen in occupied France, this
man is attempting to take over the
French nation.
If Petain is forced to submit to
Laval's demands, it may be expect
ed that France under a military dic
tatorship will become a satellite of
Germany with all the characteristics
of the "mother" country.
If Petain refuses Laval's demands
for power, it is possible German
troops will occupy all France and
wipe out any semblance of a
French government.
Reports from Europe yesterday
indicated Petain had undertaken
to follow a compromise path—re
sign and appoint Admiral Fran
cois Darlan head of the govern
ment.
* * *
B UT the most optimistic observ
ers look upon the appointment
of Darlan as no better than a stop
gap move, for the feud between La
val and Petain will go on. And the
feud between these two is rapidly
becoming a fight between Laval and
the French people.
Press reports yesterday from ob
servers both in Paris and in Vichy
reflect this situation. Petain, these
dispatches say, is the symbol of "re
constructed France," the only man
with any popular following.
Laval, at his office in Paris, is said
to receive hundreds of threatening
letters a week and according to re
ports in Vichy "would have trouble
mustering 1 per cent" of the people
behind him if he gained control of
the government.
