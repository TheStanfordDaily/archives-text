# Newell Chooses Drive Callers
## Stanford Fund Plans Dinner on Feb. 18 
### 
One hundred and twenty ''callers"
have been enlisted to work in the
Family Call, and appointment of the
remainder of the students will be
finished by tomorrow, according to
Bob Newell, chairman of the Stan
ford Fund's Family Council.
A total of 160 callers will be
needed to carry the Family Call to
Palo Alto homes of alumni and
friends of the University.
Plans are nearly completed for a
"Call to the Family" dinner to be
held in the Union Feb. 18. The five
members of the Council and the
176 aides and callers will attend
the dinner as guests of the Stanford
Fund and receive suggestions on
how to carry out their assignments.
Following the dinner, the 180 call
ers paired off in couples, will start
on their rounds of homes, taking
the Stanford Fund's Appeal directly
to the doors of the alumni and
friends.
The purpose of the Family Call is
to bring to the alumni and friends,
in a more personal way than by let
ter, an appreciation of past help.
The callers will ask the privilege of
bringing their 1941 Stanford Fund
gift back to the campus.
"This year's drive promises to be
more successful than ever," Newell
stated. "The Fiftieth Year Celebra
tion is an added incentive."
