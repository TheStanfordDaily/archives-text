# Expert on Murder Talks to Pre-Meds
## 
### 
Dr. Joseph Catton kept his au
dience sitting tensely in their seats
as he spoke to the Pre-Medical Club
last night on "Behind the Scenes of
Murder." The famous alienist gave
tragic, yet often humorous, exam
ples from his own experiences with
murder cases, and stated the press
ing need for society to supplement
its so far unsuccessful efforts to cope
with murderers pnd other criminals
with adequate psychological clinics
all over the country.
Duane Midkiff was elected presi
dent of the club, succeeding Ed
Nielsen who has been president for
the past half-year. Frank Boutin
was re-elected vice-president.
