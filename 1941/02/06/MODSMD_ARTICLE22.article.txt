## Li'l Abners Express Doubts about Social Activities after Hop 
### 
If those 70 once-desperate Daisy
Maes who signed the Hawkins wait
ing list at the A.S.S.U. office don't
call for their bids by 5 o'clock to
day, their Li'l Aimers won't spend
the evening at the Hop, according to
Pat Adams, chairman.
Bids were being sold to all com
ers yesterday, but today the bits of
pasteboard that represent social se
curity Friday night for Farm men
will be sold only to women whose
names appear on the waiting list.
Last night's figures indicate that
there will be close to 600 couples at
the dance.
A bulletin for budgeting Daisy
Maes was received late yesterday
from Bill Kimball, who announced
that cokes will be on sale at the
dance for 5 cents instead of the
usual 10.
Other financial considerations were
voiced by a typical Farm man yes
terday who said, "It's not the money
that's spent on me, it's the attention
I receive."
From the same source as above
came a commentary on the "grave
social problem" which will confront
the women after the dance, which
ends at 1 o'clock. "What's going to
happen to us then?" queried one
perplexed Li'l Abner.
Chairman Adams again confirmed
her previous announcement that
Gaieties stars will entertain the
crowd at intermission and that re
freshments will be served.
The dance is now finally sched
uled to be held in the Women's Gym
from 9:30 to 1 o'clock and Art Mc-
Cue's orchestra, outfitted in the tra
ditional Ozark manner, will perfonn
for the dancers.
