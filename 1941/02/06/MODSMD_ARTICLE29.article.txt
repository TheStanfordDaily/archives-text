# Tau Beta Pi Hears Role Of Engineer
## L. Letchfield Speaks On 'New Frontiers" At Annual Banquet 
### 
The role of the engineer in mod
ern society was appraised by two of
the most prominent men in North
ern California engineering circles at
the fourth annual Tan Beta Pi en
gineers' banquet last night.
L. T. Letchfield, assistant vice
president and consulting engineer
for the Wells-Fargo Bank of Sun
Francisco, and Smith DaFrance, en
gineer in charge of the research de
partment at MofTetl Field, play very
different roles in the engineering
profession. But their views on engi
neering today as expressed in their
talks last night, coincide to a great
degree.
Taking issue with the contention
that overproduction in industry
threatens our society, Mr. Letchfield
declared:
"Until the day when the last hu
man need is met and the last hu
man desire Ls satisfied, there will be
no overproduction."
Mr. DaFrance emphasized the
great opportunities which exist in
engineering today as a result of the
research work done in the labora
tories of the great private concerns
throughout the country.
Both Mr. Letchfield and Mr. Da-
France stressed the importance of
the ability to think rationally that
results from an engineering educa
tion.
Mr. DaFrance advised the stu
dents to "learn above all to think
clearly," and stressed the value of
acquiring the engineer's ability to
use "rational thinking based on
facts."
The speakers were introduced by
Sydney Terry, president of the Stan
ford chapter of Tau Beta Pi. Also on
the program were the presidents of
the local chapters of the A.1.E.E., the
A.S.C.E., the A.S.M.E.. the G.& M.S.,
and the I.A.E.S.
