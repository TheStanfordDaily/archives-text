## 
### 
VICHY, Feb. 5 (UP). — Marshal
Henri Philippe Petain tonight of
fered to surrender his direct con
trol of the French government to
Admiral Francois Darlan in a com
promise with Pierre Laval's demand
he be installed as premier over a
Vichy regime hand-picked by him.
Admiral Dai'lan, closest confidant
of Petain, leaves for Paris at 11 a.m.
Thursday in another effort to reach
an agreement with Laval and the
latter's German supporters and
solve the seven-week-old crisis in
French-German relations.
Rather than submit to Laval's
"pretentious" demands for almost
dictatorial powers, the 84-year-old
Petain was understood to have told
his council of ministers in an hour
long session late Wednesday he was
prepared to give up his direct lead
ership of the government, retaining
only the title of chief of state.
Under the proposed compromise
Darlan would become premier —
there is no premier now—and be the
most powerful figure of defeated
France, while Laval would be com
pelled to take a secondary role.
The situation remained extremely
critical tonight, with no indications
as to whether Laval, with strong
Nazi backing, would accept such a
compromise with the demands
which he sent to Vichy Tuesday
with Darlan.
