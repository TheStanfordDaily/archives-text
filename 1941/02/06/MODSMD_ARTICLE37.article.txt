### JERRY BRUCKER 
as we'd like to take the
credit, the baseball schedule
that appeared yesterday was prob
ably not a result of the comments on
the subject we made in this column
Monday.
Don Liebendorfer handed us the
schedule out of the ball game Mon
day afternoon, just half a dozen
hours after the paper containing the
recommendation appeared.
Now Don is a very effiicent
publicity man, but the picture of
him glancing at The Daily over
his morning cup of coffee, then
rushing right down to the office
and whipping out a copy of the
baseball schedule just to keep a
sports editor happy is a little too
far-fetched.
But however it happened, it's
mighty nice to have been able to
release the schedule at an earlier
date than usual.
♦ * *
JT'S beginning to make us pretty
mad, this constant reference of
bay area scribes to the Indian buck
etmen as "the team without re
serves."
Why don't those guys wise up
and discover that this is the 1941
season instead of the late lamented
1940 campaign. While we may not
be expert in judging basketball
players, we'll wager a used Bawlout
against a Union ham sandwich with
any of those paid-to-write boys that
this Stanford team is as well sup
plied with reserves as any in the
history of the school.
Further, we'll say that Everett
Dean could take his second live
men and stack them up against a
similar quint form any of the pres
ent conference squads, and there
wouldn't he four points difference
after a regulation game.
And don't throw the fact that the
Indians dropped the second game
against Ucla at me. Any club with
less capable reserves would have
lost by more than one point to the
Bruins on that night if they lost a
star of the caliber of Don Burness
via the foul route after 12 minutes.

J )EAR B. A. C.:
Here we go again. This time
its another beef about the tennis
coach situation that we've got
floating around midwest the dan
druff.
This is not meant to reflect on the
work of Marchy Schwartz. From
what we hear he's doing a good job
as tennis "co-ordinator," but that's
really all he can do. Marchy is not
a tennis coach. He can't tell the
men on the squad what's wrong
with their stroking or footwork.
Perhaps you figure that such lads
as Larry Dee, Jim Wade, Bob Low,
and Chuck Hutchinson have per
fected their games to such an ex
tent that no coach could help them.
Well, they're good all right, but
there isn't a tennis player living
whose game wouldn't improve if
someone was constantly around to
point out his faults. And they
know it.
Wc may get by with it this year,
if we're lucky. But in the seasons
to come, when the above mentioned
stars graduate, Stanford tennis is
going to be in mighty bad shape. So
bad, in fact, that unless something
is done in the very near future, the
sport might fade out of the picture
entirely.
Would you like that?

Wc may get by with it this year,
if we're lucky. But in the seasons
to come, when the above mentioned
stars graduate, Stanford tennis is
going to be in mighty bad shape. So
bad, in fact, that unless something
is done in the very near future, the
sport might fade out of the picture
entirely.
Would you like that?
as we'd like to take the
credit, the baseball schedule
that appeared yesterday was prob
ably not a result of the comments on
the subject we made in this column
Monday.
Don Liebendorfer handed us the
schedule out of the ball game Mon
day afternoon, just half a dozen
hours after the paper containing the
recommendation appeared.
Now Don is a very effiicent
publicity man, but the picture of
him glancing at The Daily over
his morning cup of coffee, then
rushing right down to the office
and whipping out a copy of the
baseball schedule just to keep a
sports editor happy is a little too
far-fetched.
But however it happened, it's
mighty nice to have been able to
release the schedule at an earlier
date than usual.
♦ * *
JT'S beginning to make us pretty
mad, this constant reference of
bay area scribes to the Indian buck
etmen as "the team without re
serves."
Why don't those guys wise up
and discover that this is the 1941
season instead of the late lamented
1940 campaign. While we may not
be expert in judging basketball
players, we'll wager a used Bawlout
against a Union ham sandwich with
any of those paid-to-write boys that
this Stanford team is as well sup
plied with reserves as any in the
history of the school.
Further, we'll say that Everett
Dean could take his second live
men and stack them up against a
similar quint form any of the pres
ent conference squads, and there
wouldn't he four points difference
after a regulation game.
And don't throw the fact that the
Indians dropped the second game
against Ucla at me. Any club with
less capable reserves would have
lost by more than one point to the
Bruins on that night if they lost a
star of the caliber of Don Burness
via the foul route after 12 minutes.

J )EAR B. A. C.:
Here we go again. This time
its another beef about the tennis
coach situation that we've got
floating around midwest the dan
druff.
This is not meant to reflect on the
work of Marchy Schwartz. From
what we hear he's doing a good job
as tennis "co-ordinator," but that's
really all he can do. Marchy is not
a tennis coach. He can't tell the
men on the squad what's wrong
with their stroking or footwork.
Perhaps you figure that such lads
as Larry Dee, Jim Wade, Bob Low,
and Chuck Hutchinson have per
fected their games to such an ex
tent that no coach could help them.
Well, they're good all right, but
there isn't a tennis player living
whose game wouldn't improve if
someone was constantly around to
point out his faults. And they
know it.
