## 
### 
Another major sport gets under
way 1 his week-end when the varsity
tennis team opens its season in a
match with Ihe Golden Gate Tennis
Club to be held on the varsity courts
at 2 o'clock Saturday.
The Indians, rated one of the best
net teams in the country, should not.
have any trouble in winning, al
though John Murio, city champion of
San Francisco, will probably be in
the Golden Gate line-up.
The players representing Stanford
will be picked from the squad of
ten men consisting of Larry Dee,
Emery Noale, Bob Low, Jack Gur
ley, Allan Rose. Tom Kruger, Chuck
Hutchinson, Stan Owen, Harper Ink,
and Jimmy Wade.
The doubles teams are usually
made up of Owen and Low, and
Neale and Gurley, but, Low, who
has just been released from the rest
home, will not be able to play this
week-end. Larry Dee has just had
an operation on his foot, but will
probably be able to play anyhow.
