# Pollard to Head Frosh Quintet
## 
### 
Jim Pollard yesterday was elected
captain of the Stanford frosh hoop
squad for the balance of the '41 sea
son. Pollard, who hails from Oak
land. has developed into an out
standing forward and looks like po
tential varsity material.
Scrimmage in the Pavilion was
slightly wobbly yesterday, but a lot
of the boys burned the midnight oil
Tuesday night for midterms, which
may account for the let-down.
As for the Cal-Cardinal yearling
encounter, slated for Friday eve, the
Bqar Cubs have a record of nine
victories in sixteen contests. Man
to watch is Jack Rocker, high-scor
ing center, who has been the spark
plug of Coach Bob Herwig's five all
season. The lanky center scored 13
points against Richmond High to
lead his mates to a 44-26 victory
over the Oilers last Saturday.
Fred Oliver, long absent from the
Redshirts' line-up. was going great
guns in practice and will probably
work his* way into a second-string
spot behind Bill Hooper at guard.
Having yet to lose a game in '41,
the frosh must be rated over Cali
fornia to win their three-game
series.
