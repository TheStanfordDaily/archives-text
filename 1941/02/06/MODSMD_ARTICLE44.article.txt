# Undefeated Ruggers to Face Petaluma Spartans Saturday
## 
### 
Stanford's fast-improving varsity rugby squad tangles with the Peta
luma Spartans next Saturday afternoon in what may prove to he one of
their toughest games of the season. In spite of the fact that they were
licked by Cal last week-end by a 17-3 count, the Spartans boast of a
win over the strong Olympic Club fifteen.

The coaching staff is spending a
great deal of time in working on the
forwards this week after the poor
showing that they made against
U.S.F. in the game last Saturday.
In spite of the Stanford height and
weight advantage, the Dons con
sistently got control of the ball in
the lineouts. Lack of condition
showed up in the forward's follow
ing of the ball.
PRACTICE PASSING
The Indian backs have been
working on their passing rushes
after they lost ground several times
last week because of fumbles. Loss
of Norm Standlee and Frankie Al
bert was also somewhat responsible
for the fact that the Cards were
only able to score eight points on
the much greener Dons.
In a preliminary to the varsity
game the Stanford Reserves will at
tempt to break into the win column
in a fracas with the frosh.
RESERVES BETTER
In spite of their three-tie record,
the Reserves have shown up very
well in the last two games that they
have played with the Menlo Ram
blers and Menlo Junior College, and
should have little trouble in dispos
ing of the inexperienced frosh if all
ihe players show up for the contest,
which was the main difficulty in
their last game.
Instead of playing the jaysee game
after the varsity tilt as has been
tried the last three times, the Re
serve-frosh fracas will start at 1:30
with the varsity game following im
mediately afterward.
