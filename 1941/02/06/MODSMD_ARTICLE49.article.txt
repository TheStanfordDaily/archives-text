## Card Hoopsters Tighten Offense for Cal Clash 
### JERRY BRUCKER, Sports Editor 
Riff tilings can be expected to happen in the Pavilion Friday night
when Stanford and California clash in the second contest of their annual
four-game basketball series.
From the looks of things around their practice sessions, the Indians
are preparing for great happeningsâ€”and with a definite end in mind. The

are plenty good that the
same sort of attitude is prevalent
across the bay at the Berkeley insti
tution as Coach Nibs Price sends his
surprising Bears through their daily
workouts.
All of which goes to show that
the stage is definitely set for one of
the biggest Big Games in Stanford
and Cal hoop history, especially in
view of the fact that these two quin
tets are waging an increasingly close
battle for the conference leadership.
TICKETS SOLD OUT
The cracker-box Pavilion has
been completely sold out to stu
dents of Stanford and Cal. There
aren't even enough tickets for the
students of the two universities, let
alone for all the loyal alumni. There
will be no public sale of tickets.
The sellout shouldn't be unexpect
ed, however, for it is only logical to
conclude that there should be enough
basketball fans included in the
20 000 who make up the student
bodies of Stanford and Cal to fill
the 2800 seats in the Pavilion.
DEFENSE WORKS
The close fight that Cal gave them
when the two teams met several
weeks ago has made the Indians
quite apprehensive of the Bears.
Yesterday afternoon Coach Everett
Dean sent his charges through a
snappy session against the staggered
zone defense used by California.
The offensive tactics the Indians
worked on yesterday weren't en
tirely new, but they seem adapt
able to this particular defense;
which is the same as saying that it
doesn't look as if the Cal defense is
adaptable to this style of offense.
