A FRIEND of mine said recently, "I haven't
heard any good news in the last two
weeks." Not eager to be a Pollyanna, I hesitate

One bit of good news stems from the list
of four nominees for the B.A.C. spot. Three
of the candidates are not physical education
majors, nor are they, as far as we know, athletic
scholarship holders. Any of the three, by virtue
of this, should make an excellent representative
for Stanford undergraduates on the Board. They
deserve the support of all who vote on Tues
day. This item may appear trivial, but it comes
as the most encouraging sign of the annual win
ter quarter election fracas.
