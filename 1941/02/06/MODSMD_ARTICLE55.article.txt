# Wingfoot Rumors

### 
A GUEST lecturer here at Stanford, Dr.
George Russell Harrison, is currently be
ing mentioned as a possible successor to Dr.
Ray Lyman Wilbur when the latter steps out as
President of the University this year.
Dr. Harrison, who graduated from Stanford in
1919 and was an associate professor of physics
here before he started teaching at the Massa
chusetts Institute of Technology, was seen hav
ing lunch at the Union with members of the
faculty committee that is collaborating with the
Board of Trustees on the selection of the new
President.
That is the basis of the rumor. Any sort of
substantiation is virtually impossible inasmuch
as everyone having any knowledge of the ne
gotiations going on remains absolutely close
mouthed.
From time to time other names have been
mentioned. Last November Wendell Willkie's
name rose amidst a cloud of speculation. The
Willkie boom lasted quick, died on its feet, as it
were, mainly because Willkie obviously know
little or nothing about being supposedly con
sidered for the post.
One name that has been constantly men
tioned in a guarded way is that of Dr. Loren R.
Chandler, Dean of Stanford's School of Medi
cine.
Still another rumor has it that the man to re
place Dr. Wilbur has already been chosen. He
is reputed to be from another section of the
country, and to be a man who excels in the
contact work necessary for solicitation of en
dowment funds. He also possesses, naturally,
the academic qualifications to be expected of
a candidate for the position of President of Stan
ford University.
Whether the above rumor has any basis we
do not know, although it is not improbable.
However, probably every educator of any
fame whatsoever who visits Stanford in the near
future for any reason will have his name ban
died about by persons speculating on Dr. Wil
bur's successor.
Dr. Harrison may be the man. But whether he
is or not, the rumors will keep centering on vari
ous different persons until the actual choice is
revealed.â€”G. M.
