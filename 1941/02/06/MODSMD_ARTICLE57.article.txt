# Political Traitor?

### 
WENDELL WILLKIE, defeated G.O.P. candi
date for the presidency of the United
States, completed his inspection tour of bomb
racked England yesterday and at present is fly
ing home to testify to his findings before the
Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, which
is now discussing the Lend-Lease Bill.
Before leaving England Willkie directed a
violent speech to the German people in which
he bitterly flayed their government. In his com
munication, which was translated into German
and transmitted to Germany by the British
Broadcasting Company, Willkie said:
"I am of purely German descent . . . Tell
the German people we German-Americans re
ject the hate, aggression, and lust for power of
the present German government."
When he returns to the United States he will
be called to the stand of the Senate's Foreign
Relations Committee and is expected to be the

Administration's star witness.
That this situation is dramatic is a vast under
statement. It is doubtful if American history
records a similar instance, where a man de
feated for the highest office in the land turns
around within a lew months to back the man
who defeated him. And to back him on a bill
to which his own party is officially opposed.
Wendell Willkie is an unusual man. He first
made history by grabbing his party's nomina
tion away from the professional politicians. He
made more history by rolling up the greatest
number of votes any defeated candidate has
ever registered.
And now he continues to make history by
refusing to let traditional party politics dictate
to his conscience.—G. M. ■
