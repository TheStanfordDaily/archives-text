### BUD AMES 
MAKE THE SWALLOWING EASIER
JF YOU put your mind to it you can probably, right
at this very minute, think back as far as the be
ginning of last autumn quarter.
Well, if you do it now, you will remember that at
about that time you and your loved ones were writh
ing in the throes of a problem entirely new to this land
of fields of flowing grain and of buzzing metropolises.
You were mulling over the yeahs and the nays of the
proposed selective service bill which was being shuf
fled through Congress. Whether or not you felt that
you were being dealt from the bottom of the deck,
you soon found that you would accept selective service
as a future institution—or else.
* * * *
the bill was passed. You cocked your head in
best bird dog style, puckered your lips quizzically,
and then, with a cure-all shrug of your shoulders,
you said:
"Well, there's not much to be done about the mat
ter, now that it is law. I guess there must be some
real need for this draft business, or else the big boys
down in Washington would never have put through
this expensive program.
"Well, if it must be, it must be. Maybe life in the
army ior a year won't be as bad as everybody says."
And so you shoved the problem as far as possible
back into the not-so-gray recesses of your mind, and
waited for that expected—but actually dreaded—day,
when a uniformed man would inform you that your
number was up.
So you accepted the decision.
* * * *
now the wheels of selective service have been
turning. Thousands of men have been yanked into
camps. Thousands of men have been ferried out to a
life of sea - sickness. Hundreds of men have been
thrown into the air.
You accepted this. It wasn't so hard to swallow.
Why then does the radio and the press insist upon
continually throwing at you bits of information which
do not make such easy swallowing, which stick in
your throat and make you wish you hadn't attempted
to swallow them.
The newspaper spreads its front page with a story
of a troop train being derailed on the way to camp, with
the resulting death of a couple of young recruits.
Isn't there enough other important news to spread all
over the newspapers? A lot more important things
than troop train wrecks are happening every day.
And how does such news affect you and the rest of
the John Does?
The radio news commentator, who has only 15 min
utes in which to cram in all the news of the day, takes
a large hunk of his time in describing the young re
cruit pilot who crashed and whose "bloody, burnt,
battered, bruised body was found hanging on a picket
fence."
How does such news affect you and the rest of the
John Does?
Give us the news, you say. But better that it be
news that is easier swallowing. If too much sticks in
our throats, we are liable to choke—and get sick at
our stomachs.
