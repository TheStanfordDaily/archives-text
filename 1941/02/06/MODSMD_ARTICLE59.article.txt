A STANFORD INDICTMENT

r EDITOR, SIR:
Only the philosopher can know himself; for he
has special introverted eyes and lives in a world
where students are not, nor menials—himself, only an
idea. Most of us have to rely on the criticisms and
witticisms of others if we are to understand ourselves
at all well.
The best books on Frenchmen are written by Ger
mans who condemn them, on Americans by British
ers who envy our animal-like energies and stupidi
ties; and students are best analyzed by the menials
that wait upon them because these have caustic, cold
eyes carefully designed by the intrigues of chance.
Your menial's mind is a curious thing, warped and
twisted by circumstance and inclination and a thou
sand shadowy by-plays of its furtive ego; and your
menial is a shiftless sort, lusting hard after adventure
and life, drifting and not being anywhere long, until,
late into life, his lusts burned low, he meets a con
genial sort and settles down, forever, wherever the
meeting may hap, a menial always. But his judgments
of Men and America are worth listening to because
he looks upward from the bottom: and at the bot
tom is only colorless, bald fact.
Your menial knows most Stanford students are tal
ented, far above America's average. But (and he can
tell these things from your deportment, gait, luster
in your eyes, your food-filled mutterings) he thinks
much of your talents wasted on efforts aimed low, after
achievements attainable to the lesser endowed.
He believes few of you scholars, yet fewer lovers
of Learning; and these of you are hidden someplace
where from your glory rarely shineth. Your menial
believes more than half of you will be educated at
your lips only, and his own ego therefore swells. He
knows it is not hard to learn big words and say little
thoughts.
Your greatest virtue? Your good humor, of course!
You are all good fellows and can laugh away much
work. Good humor is often indicative of a self too
easily satisfied.
Your greatest vice? Not drinking nor betting nor
laziness, but intellectual pride. Pride that shows it
self in big words and little thoughts and in rash dis
dain for the thoughts of the common man.
At the bottom, there are no niceties; only work
and sweat, and there is no veneer. Drifting hither,
wherever, and yon over America's vast limitless acres,
America's vast beautiful acres, through America's
great pulsing cities, America's great lust-ridden cities,
your menial has seen men rise and men fall. He
knows education is a stumbling block to many; for
it induces the aforementioned intellectual pride; and
with this pride no man can ever rise.
He knows, beyond everything. Stanford students,
like most students everywhere, need a fearful and a
tremendous humbling.

much of your talents wasted on efforts aimed low, after
achievements attainable to the lesser endowed.
He believes few of you scholars, yet fewer lovers
of Learning; and these of you are hidden someplace
where from your glory rarely shineth. Your menial
believes more than half of you will be educated at
your lips only, and his own ego therefore swells. He
knows it is not hard to learn big words and say little
thoughts.
Your greatest virtue? Your good humor, of course!
You are all good fellows and can laugh away much
work. Good humor is often indicative of a self too
easily satisfied.
Your greatest vice? Not drinking nor betting nor
laziness, but intellectual pride. Pride that shows it
self in big words and little thoughts and in rash dis
dain for the thoughts of the common man.
At the bottom, there are no niceties; only work
and sweat, and there is no veneer. Drifting hither,
wherever, and yon over America's vast limitless acres,
America's vast beautiful acres, through America's
great pulsing cities, America's great lust-ridden cities,
your menial has seen men rise and men fall. He
knows education is a stumbling block to many; for
it induces the aforementioned intellectual pride; and
with this pride no man can ever rise.
He knows, beyond everything. Stanford students,
like most students everywhere, need a fearful and a
tremendous humbling.

Only the philosopher can know himself; for he
has special introverted eyes and lives in a world
where students are not, nor menials—himself, only an
idea. Most of us have to rely on the criticisms and
witticisms of others if we are to understand ourselves
at all well.
The best books on Frenchmen are written by Ger
mans who condemn them, on Americans by British
ers who envy our animal-like energies and stupidi
ties; and students are best analyzed by the menials
that wait upon them because these have caustic, cold
eyes carefully designed by the intrigues of chance.
Your menial's mind is a curious thing, warped and
twisted by circumstance and inclination and a thou
sand shadowy by-plays of its furtive ego; and your
menial is a shiftless sort, lusting hard after adventure
and life, drifting and not being anywhere long, until,
late into life, his lusts burned low, he meets a con
genial sort and settles down, forever, wherever the
meeting may hap, a menial always. But his judgments
of Men and America are worth listening to because
he looks upward from the bottom: and at the bot
tom is only colorless, bald fact.
Your menial knows most Stanford students are tal
ented, far above America's average. But (and he can
tell these things from your deportment, gait, luster
in your eyes, your food-filled mutterings) he thinks
much of your talents wasted on efforts aimed low, after
achievements attainable to the lesser endowed.
