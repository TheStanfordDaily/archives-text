### 
"The Good Humor Man" by George
Price, on sale at the Stanford
Bookstore
In this marvelous book, George
Price, the well-known funnyman of
the New Yorker, Collier's, and Sat
urday Evening Post, has put his
funniest and most famous cartoons.
All of Price's little gems are here,
including the one of the lady cow
who turns a pair of soulful eyes on
the dullard who is milking her and
says to him, "Gently, sir; it's Moth
er's Day."
Then there is the priceless one of
the bewildered guests as they are
shown by their hosts into the guest
room filled with sleeping people, a
cat nursing her family, and women
undressing, with the remark, "Just
make yourselves at home!"
MAN OR MOOSE?
Also included is the one of the
rather queer-looking individual who
returns home with a bedraggled sign
saying, "Bring Back the Bull Moose
Party!" and a large moose's head
jammed over his own. His wife
greets him with the remark, "Well,
how did the rally go?"
In addition to the extensive col
lection of famous Price humor, a
section is on the artist's life as he
was a young and struggling art stu
dent. George Price, like almost all
cartoonists, originally intended do
ing serious painting and spent a great
deal of time studying the Old Mas
ters.
COY MODEL
His diary tells that his first bottle
neck occurred when his model re
fused to undress to pose for him,
making it necessary for him to guess
as to how the lines should go. Con
sequently he turned to cartooning.
In two hundred pages the car
toonist has packed the book with
laughs. You can't go wrong by
buying this one. George Price
should bring out one of these an
thologies yearly, for this one is in
valuable.â€”Wuenschel
