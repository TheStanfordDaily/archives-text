# Luncheon Club Told Nazi Tales
## Tyranny, Hard Life Pictured by Refugee 
### 
Fleeing Nazi Germany, Miss Ruth
Frankel came to America via Lon
don and the Philippines. Addressing
the Luncheon Club yesterday, Miss
Frankel told her experiences In a
Germany impoverished by war, in a
Germany dominated by Hitler, and
in America, "where freedom reigns."
"Life was not easy after the War.
New clothes were unheard of, and I
saw oranges in picture books. While
the new democracy built parks,
swimming pools, and libraries, it
made no attempt to educate the
people to democracy," Miss Frankel
said. The teachers still believed in
and taught the old imperialism.
Miss Frankel pictured her desire
to come to America because life
under Hitler was a nightmare. Books
are censored and "One always has
the feeling that you are watched."
After months in Shanghai and the
Philippines, Miss Frankel at last ar
rived in San Francisco. Impressed
with the wonderful feeling of secur
ity in America as well as the free
dom and friendliness, Miss Frankel
said, "I would never go back to Ger
many even if I could."
