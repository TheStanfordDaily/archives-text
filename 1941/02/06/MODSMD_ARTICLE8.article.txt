# S.E. Post Stars Klystron Story

### 
"The Klystron Boys," written by
Frank J. Taylor, '19, of Los Altos,
telling the story of the invention of
the Stanford klystron ultra-short
wave radio tube, appears in this
week's Saturday Evening Post.
Taylor relates the human story of
Sigurd Varian, a Pan-American
flyer, and his brother, Russell, who
settled down at Stanford to work the
idea with the aid of Professors D. L.
Webster and W. W. Hansen, of the
physics department.
Today the klystron aids engineers
to do things in radio which yester
day were only dreams. Its military
uses are one of the most important,
as Mr. Taylor reveals in his article.
