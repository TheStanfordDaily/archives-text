1 ERMANY is demanding that the
* French government be moved
from Vichy to Paris and that Pierre
Laval be installed as dictator of the
new puppet regime.
Until yesterday this news was
merely speculation based on rumors
circulated both in Paris and in the
provisional capital at Vichy. But
yesterday a press association dis
patch from Paris, via Berlin, indi
cated that the German pressure is
real and officially sanctioned by the
Nazi government.
On Feb. 3, an American corre
spondent in Paris tried to file a
story to the United States giving
details of the conflict between Nazi
supported Laval and French-sup
ported Petain. German censors in
Paris relayed the dispatch to Berlin
for approval by other authorities.
And only yesterday, Feb. 6, the
story reached New York.
In other words, what appears in
that dispatch is factual, or at least
what German censors want Ameri
cans to believe. This time observers
agree the Germans are not merely
dishing out propaganda.
According to the dispatch, the
newly-organized Party of National
Popular Concentration in Paris which
is supporting Laval will stage a
"huge" demonstration in Paris with
in the next few days with Laval the
principal speaker to show its
strength.
But the most interesting part of
the dispatch is the list of conces
sions that Germany is willing to
make France in return for "col
laboration," which it is understood
includes French Africa. Laval is
supposed to have submitted these
German proposals to Petain just
before the Vichy government
ousted him as vice-premier. The
German terms for collaboration:
1. Reduction of the daily levy im
posed upon France for the mainte
nance of the German army of occu
pation from 400,000,000 to 50,000,000
francs.
2. "Practical elimination" of the
line of demarcation between Nazi
held and unoccupied France.
3. A return of the government to
Paris.
. 4. Release of the 500,000 to 1,300,-
000 French prisoners now in Ger
many.
5. Italy to relinquish all claims to
Corsica, Nice, and Djibouti.
6. Germany to take only Alsace
and part of Lorraine.
7. German security of the French
Empire.
8. Germany to cease requisitioning
supplies from France.
9. German assurance of sufficient
supplies of food for all France.
These are the concessions Ger
many is willing to make in order to
make Laval master of France. Ger
many must be sure Laval will "col
laborate" willingly to make pro
posals of this magnitude. The ques
tion remains, what has Laval prom
ised secretly in return?

days ago Wendell Will
kie broadcast indirectly a mes
sage to the German people. Asked
for any statement he would like to
have relayed to Germany, Willkie
gave the British Broadcasting Com
pany a short talk, part of which
follows:
"I am of purely German de
scent. My family name is not
Willkie but Willicke. My grand
parents left Germany 90 years ago
because they were against autoc
racy and demanded the right to
live as free men.
"I too claim that right. I am proud
of my German blood, but I hate ag
gression and tyranny.
"Tell the German people my con
victions are shared in full by an
overwhelming majority of my fel
low countrymen of German de
scent. They too believe in freedom
and human right.
"Tell the German people we
German-Americans reject the hate,
aggression, and lust for power of
the present German government."

will be beheaded. The German gov

cated that the German pressure is
real and officially sanctioned by the
Nazi government.
On Feb. 3, an American corre
spondent in Paris tried to file a
story to the United States giving
details of the conflict between Nazi
supported Laval and French-sup
ported Petain. German censors in
Paris relayed the dispatch to Berlin
for approval by other authorities.
And only yesterday, Feb. 6, the
story reached New York.
In other words, what appears in
that dispatch is factual, or at least
what German censors want Ameri
cans to believe. This time observers
agree the Germans are not merely
dishing out propaganda.
According to the dispatch, the
newly-organized Party of National
Popular Concentration in Paris which
is supporting Laval will stage a
"huge" demonstration in Paris with
in the next few days with Laval the
principal speaker to show its
strength.
But the most interesting part of
the dispatch is the list of conces
sions that Germany is willing to
make France in return for "col
laboration," which it is understood
includes French Africa. Laval is
supposed to have submitted these
German proposals to Petain just
before the Vichy government
ousted him as vice-premier. The
German terms for collaboration:
1. Reduction of the daily levy im
posed upon France for the mainte
nance of the German army of occu
pation from 400,000,000 to 50,000,000
francs.
2. "Practical elimination" of the
line of demarcation between Nazi
held and unoccupied France.
3. A return of the government to
Paris.
. 4. Release of the 500,000 to 1,300,-
000 French prisoners now in Ger
many.
5. Italy to relinquish all claims to
Corsica, Nice, and Djibouti.
6. Germany to take only Alsace
and part of Lorraine.
7. German security of the French
Empire.
8. Germany to cease requisitioning
supplies from France.
9. German assurance of sufficient
supplies of food for all France.
These are the concessions Ger
many is willing to make in order to
make Laval master of France. Ger
many must be sure Laval will "col
laborate" willingly to make pro
posals of this magnitude. The ques
tion remains, what has Laval prom
ised secretly in return?

And only yesterday, Feb. 6, the
story reached New York.
In other words, what appears in
that dispatch is factual, or at least
what German censors want Ameri
cans to believe. This time observers
agree the Germans are not merely
dishing out propaganda.
According to the dispatch, the
newly-organized Party of National
Popular Concentration in Paris which
is supporting Laval will stage a
"huge" demonstration in Paris with
in the next few days with Laval the
principal speaker to show its
strength.
But the most interesting part of
the dispatch is the list of conces
sions that Germany is willing to
make France in return for "col
laboration," which it is understood
includes French Africa. Laval is
supposed to have submitted these
German proposals to Petain just
before the Vichy government
ousted him as vice-premier. The
German terms for collaboration:
1. Reduction of the daily levy im
posed upon France for the mainte
nance of the German army of occu
pation from 400,000,000 to 50,000,000
francs.
2. "Practical elimination" of the
line of demarcation between Nazi
held and unoccupied France.
3. A return of the government to
Paris.
. 4. Release of the 500,000 to 1,300,-
000 French prisoners now in Ger
many.
5. Italy to relinquish all claims to
Corsica, Nice, and Djibouti.
6. Germany to take only Alsace
and part of Lorraine.
7. German security of the French
Empire.
8. Germany to cease requisitioning
supplies from France.
9. German assurance of sufficient
supplies of food for all France.
These are the concessions Ger
many is willing to make in order to
make Laval master of France. Ger
many must be sure Laval will "col
laborate" willingly to make pro
posals of this magnitude. The ques
tion remains, what has Laval prom
ised secretly in return?

for any statement he would like to
have relayed to Germany, Willkie
gave the British Broadcasting Com
pany a short talk, part of which
follows:
"I am of purely German de
scent. My family name is not
Willkie but Willicke. My grand
parents left Germany 90 years ago
because they were against autoc
racy and demanded the right to
live as free men.
"I too claim that right. I am proud
of my German blood, but I hate ag
gression and tyranny.
"Tell the German people my con
victions are shared in full by an
overwhelming majority of my fel
low countrymen of German de
scent. They too believe in freedom
and human right.
"Tell the German people we
German-Americans reject the hate,
aggression, and lust for power of
the present German government."
Only a few Germans in Germany
heard this foreign broadcast. Ger
mans who did, and were caught,
will be beheaded. The German gov
ernment, as a returning Berlin cor
respondent pointed out, does not
like its citizens to know what
Americans are thinking.
1 ERMANY is demanding that the
* French government be moved
from Vichy to Paris and that Pierre
Laval be installed as dictator of the
new puppet regime.
Until yesterday this news was
merely speculation based on rumors
circulated both in Paris and in the
provisional capital at Vichy. But
yesterday a press association dis
patch from Paris, via Berlin, indi
cated that the German pressure is
real and officially sanctioned by the
Nazi government.
On Feb. 3, an American corre
spondent in Paris tried to file a
story to the United States giving
details of the conflict between Nazi
supported Laval and French-sup
ported Petain. German censors in
Paris relayed the dispatch to Berlin
for approval by other authorities.
And only yesterday, Feb. 6, the
story reached New York.
