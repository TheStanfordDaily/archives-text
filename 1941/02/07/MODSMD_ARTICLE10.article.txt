# IF SUN SHINES, UNDERPASS WILL OPEN
## 
### VIC MINAHAN 
If the sun is shining outside your
window this morning, you'll he rid
ing to Paly through the underpass
tomorrow.
That was the announcement of
Chief Engineer George W. Thomp
son yesterday afternoon. Eyeing the
unsettled skies worriedly, he re
marked:
"If it doesn't rain tomorrow we'll
be able to finish painting the lines
and cleaning off the pavement in
time to open both underpasses be
fore the week-end. If it rains, you'll
just have to wait until Monday—
if it doesn't rain Monday."
According to Engineer Thompson,
the prolonged rainy season is the
cause of the late opening of the
underpasses. The opening date was
originally set for Feb. 1. but the wet
weather forced a week's postpone

'ment.
Don't rush down to he the "first
one through," howevei*. Because
you won't be the first.
"Cars have been scooting through
here at various intervals for the last
week—every one of them thinking
he was the first one through," Mr.
Thompson remarked. "It's always
that way near the end of a job like
this.
"See, there goes another one now!"
And a woman with a wildly tri
umphant look in her eye shot
through on El Camino, studiously
ignoring the barriers and "detour"
signs.
The opening of the underpasses
will mark the end of more than a
year's work, which began during
Christmas vacation of 1939. At first
only the construction on the Palo

Alto side was planned, but a sudden
discovery of more money by the
eity fathers caused the project to be
extended to include elimination of
the Palm Drive-El Camino crossing.
The entire project has cost ap
; proximately $180,000, of which $80,-
000 was paid by Palo Alto and the
! balance by the state.
Although the underpasses will be
opened this week-end, weather per
mitting, work on the project will be
continued for several weeks, ac
cording to Engineer Thompson.
Landscaping and paving of some of
the leaves' of the "cloverleaf" sys
tem of side roads remains to be done.
The latter eliminates unnecessary
left-hand turns and traffic snarls.
The lighting system has also to be
installed.
7 he official and ceremonious open
ing of the underpasses will take
place sometime in March, preceded
by an elaborate "transportation fes
tival" and accompanied by the usual
bunting, speeches, and general cele
bration.
