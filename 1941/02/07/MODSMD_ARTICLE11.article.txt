# Cards, Bears to Tangle Tonight in Cage Crisis
## 
### DON SELBY 
It's Stanford against Cal again in
the Pavilion at 8 o'clock tonight.
But this time there's more than the
Big Game basketball series at stake.
With half the Coast Conference
schedule finished, the Indian cagers
are on top of the league heap, but a
hot breath, otherwise known as one
game, behind them, are the boys
from Berkeley.
LEAD OR TIE?
If Stanford can cop the decision
tonight, the Indians will again move
way out in front of the rest of the
field in the race for the champion
ship of the Southern Division. On
the other hand, if the Bears win, the
race will be tied up tighter than a
fiddle string, with Cal and Stanford
each having four wins and two
losses.
From the performances of the two
teams in the opening game of this
season's Big Game hoop series, there
is very little evidence on which to
base a prediction for tonight's battle.
Of course, the Indians won; but it
was an extremely close game, 35-31,
which saw the Bears miss no fewer
than four easy lay-in shots in the
last four minutes of play.
CARDS CAN DO 'ER
Stanford has a ball club which
can play real basketball when it is
on its game. But that is the big
question. Will the Indians, indi
vidually and collectively, be on their
game tonight? They weren't the
last time they met Cal and a nar
row escape was the result. Tonight
should see Stanford take the Bears
down a peg, but a tough battle is
definitely on tap.
One of the tough things about the
Bears is that you can never tell be
forehand which ones of them are
going to be hot on any particular
night. Against Stanford last time it
was Merv Lafaille, but since then
several others, including Jim Bailey
