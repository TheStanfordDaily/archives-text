# Cards, Bears to Tangle Tonight in Cage Crisis
## 
### DON SELBY 
It's Stanford against Cal again in
the Pavilion at 8 o'clock tonight.
But this time there's more than the
Big Game basketball series at stake.
With half the Coast Conference
schedule finished, the Indian cagers
are on top of the league heap, but a
hot breath, otherwise known as one
game, behind them, are the boys
from Berkeley.
LEAD OR TIE?
If Stanford can cop the decision
tonight, the Indians will again move
way out in front of the rest of the
field in the race for the champion
ship of the Southern Division. On
the other hand, if the Bears win, the
race will be tied up tighter than a
fiddle string, with Cal and Stanford
each having four wins and two
losses.
From the performances of the two
teams in the opening game of this
season's Big Game hoop series, there
is very little evidence on which to
base a prediction for tonight's battle.
Of course, the Indians won; but it
was an extremely close game, 35-31,
which saw the Bears miss no fewer
than four easy lay-in shots in the
last four minutes of play.
CARDS CAN DO 'ER
Stanford has a ball club which
can play real basketball when it is
on its game. But that is the big
question. Will the Indians, indi
vidually and collectively, be on their
game tonight? They weren't the
last time they met Cal and a nar
row escape was the result. Tonight
should see Stanford take the Bears
down a peg, but a tough battle is
definitely on tap.
One of the tough things about the
Bears is that you can never tell be
forehand which ones of them are
going to be hot on any particular
night. Against Stanford last time it
was Merv Lafaille, but since then
several others, including Jim Bailey
and Bob Alameida, have taken their
turns in the star role.
IT'S UNPREDICTABLE
Kenny Davidson, co-captain of
the Indian cagers, did the guarding
job on Lafaille when the two teams
met before, and although he failed
to hold the Bear hot shot down in
the first half, he did a pretty good
job in the second period before go
ing out of the game on fouls.
But the Bears are probably hav
ing just as hard a time as the In
dians are in trying to figure out who
their opDonent's big gun is going to
be tonight. It's just one of those un
predictable things.
DON AND FORDY
Stanford's starting forwards, Don
Williams and Fordy Anderson, are
two of the best ball-handling for
wards in the Southern Division, and
Williams is also one of the best
shots, being surpassed only by his
teammate, Don Burness, in points
scored this season.
Anderson has his hot and cold
nights, but when he is really play
ing his ball game there isn't a
smoother floor man in these parts.
He played one of his better games
in the first Ucla encounter and the
result was a Card victory and 15
points to Anderson's credit.
MAN-TO-MAN WORK
That Burness can get around
Johnny McGee to pop the points was
shown in the last Cal game when he
hit the hoop for 19 points. Stopping
McGee was something else again,
however, and a point that Burness
found quite difficult, the Bear cen
ter breaking loose several times for
easy set-ups.
Since then the Indians have done
quite a bit of work on their man-to
man-all-over-the-court defense, and
the Bears should have a much
harder time breaking free tonight.
Then, too, Stanford knows what to
expect from Cal in the way of de
fense.
OFFENSE TACTICS
Coach Everett Dean has given his
charges a series of offensive maneu
vers designed to take advantage of
the weaknesses of this staggered
zone defense. Whether or not these
tactics will prove effective or not
will be shown tonight.

Anderson F Lafaille

ing his ball game there isn't a
smoother floor man in these parts.
He played one of his better games
in the first Ucla encounter and the
result was a Card victory and 15
points to Anderson's credit.
MAN-TO-MAN WORK
That Burness can get around
Johnny McGee to pop the points was
shown in the last Cal game when he
hit the hoop for 19 points. Stopping
McGee was something else again,
however, and a point that Burness
found quite difficult, the Bear cen
ter breaking loose several times for
easy set-ups.
Since then the Indians have done
quite a bit of work on their man-to
man-all-over-the-court defense, and
the Bears should have a much
harder time breaking free tonight.
Then, too, Stanford knows what to
expect from Cal in the way of de
fense.
OFFENSE TACTICS
Coach Everett Dean has given his
charges a series of offensive maneu
vers designed to take advantage of
the weaknesses of this staggered

will be shown tonight.
Tiie probable starting line-ups:
STANFORD CALIFORNIA
Anderson F Lafaille
Williams F Tamm
Burness C McGee
Cowden G Bailey
Davidson G I lodes or
Alameida
It's Stanford against Cal again in
the Pavilion at 8 o'clock tonight.
But this time there's more than the
Big Game basketball series at stake.
With half the Coast Conference
schedule finished, the Indian cagers
are on top of the league heap, but a
hot breath, otherwise known as one
game, behind them, are the boys
from Berkeley.
LEAD OR TIE?
If Stanford can cop the decision
tonight, the Indians will again move
way out in front of the rest of the
field in the race for the champion
ship of the Southern Division. On
the other hand, if the Bears win, the
race will be tied up tighter than a
fiddle string, with Cal and Stanford
each having four wins and two
losses.
From the performances of the two
teams in the opening game of this
season's Big Game hoop series, there
is very little evidence on which to
base a prediction for tonight's battle.
Of course, the Indians won; but it
was an extremely close game, 35-31,
which saw the Bears miss no fewer
than four easy lay-in shots in the
last four minutes of play.
CARDS CAN DO 'ER
Stanford has a ball club which
can play real basketball when it is
on its game. But that is the big
question. Will the Indians, indi
vidually and collectively, be on their
game tonight? They weren't the
last time they met Cal and a nar
row escape was the result. Tonight
should see Stanford take the Bears
down a peg, but a tough battle is
definitely on tap.
One of the tough things about the
Bears is that you can never tell be
forehand which ones of them are
going to be hot on any particular
night. Against Stanford last time it
was Merv Lafaille, but since then
several others, including Jim Bailey
and Bob Alameida, have taken their
turns in the star role.
IT'S UNPREDICTABLE
Kenny Davidson, co-captain of
the Indian cagers, did the guarding
job on Lafaille when the two teams
met before, and although he failed
to hold the Bear hot shot down in
the first half, he did a pretty good
job in the second period before go
ing out of the game on fouls.
But the Bears are probably hav
ing just as hard a time as the In
dians are in trying to figure out who
their opDonent's big gun is going to
be tonight. It's just one of those un
predictable things.
DON AND FORDY
Stanford's starting forwards, Don

One of the tough things about the
Bears is that you can never tell be
forehand which ones of them are
going to be hot on any particular
night. Against Stanford last time it
was Merv Lafaille, but since then
several others, including Jim Bailey
and Bob Alameida, have taken their
turns in the star role.
IT'S UNPREDICTABLE
Kenny Davidson, co-captain of
the Indian cagers, did the guarding
job on Lafaille when the two teams
met before, and although he failed
to hold the Bear hot shot down in
the first half, he did a pretty good
job in the second period before go
ing out of the game on fouls.
But the Bears are probably hav
ing just as hard a time as the In
dians are in trying to figure out who
their opDonent's big gun is going to
be tonight. It's just one of those un
predictable things.
DON AND FORDY
Stanford's starting forwards, Don
Williams and Fordy Anderson, are
two of the best ball-handling for
wards in the Southern Division, and
Williams is also one of the best
shots, being surpassed only by his
teammate, Don Burness, in points
scored this season.
Anderson has his hot and cold
nights, but when he is really play
ing his ball game there isn't a
smoother floor man in these parts.
He played one of his better games
in the first Ucla encounter and the
result was a Card victory and 15
points to Anderson's credit.
MAN-TO-MAN WORK
That Burness can get around
Johnny McGee to pop the points was
shown in the last Cal game when he
hit the hoop for 19 points. Stopping
McGee was something else again,
however, and a point that Burness
found quite difficult, the Bear cen
ter breaking loose several times for
easy set-ups.
Since then the Indians have done
quite a bit of work on their man-to
man-all-over-the-court defense, and
the Bears should have a much
harder time breaking free tonight.
Then, too, Stanford knows what to
expect from Cal in the way of de
fense.
OFFENSE TACTICS
Coach Everett Dean has given his
charges a series of offensive maneu
vers designed to take advantage of
the weaknesses of this staggered
zone defense. Whether or not these
tactics will prove effective or not
will be shown tonight.
Tiie probable starting line-ups:
STANFORD CALIFORNIA
Anderson F Lafaille
Williams F Tamm
Burness C McGee
Cowden G Bailey
Davidson G I lodes or
Alameida
It's Stanford against Cal again in
the Pavilion at 8 o'clock tonight.
But this time there's more than the
Big Game basketball series at stake.
With half the Coast Conference
schedule finished, the Indian cagers
are on top of the league heap, but a
hot breath, otherwise known as one
game, behind them, are the boys
from Berkeley.
LEAD OR TIE?
If Stanford can cop the decision
tonight, the Indians will again move
way out in front of the rest of the
field in the race for the champion
ship of the Southern Division. On
the other hand, if the Bears win, the
race will be tied up tighter than a
fiddle string, with Cal and Stanford
each having four wins and two
losses.
From the performances of the two
teams in the opening game of this
season's Big Game hoop series, there
is very little evidence on which to
base a prediction for tonight's battle.
Of course, the Indians won; but it
was an extremely close game, 35-31,
which saw the Bears miss no fewer
than four easy lay-in shots in the
last four minutes of play.
CARDS CAN DO 'ER
Stanford has a ball club which
can play real basketball when it is
on its game. But that is the big
question. Will the Indians, indi
vidually and collectively, be on their
game tonight? They weren't the
last time they met Cal and a nar
row escape was the result. Tonight
should see Stanford take the Bears
down a peg, but a tough battle is
definitely on tap.
One of the tough things about the
Bears is that you can never tell be
forehand which ones of them are
going to be hot on any particular
night. Against Stanford last time it
