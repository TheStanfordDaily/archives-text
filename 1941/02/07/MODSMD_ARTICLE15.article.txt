# Farm Meets Its Nominees
## 
### 
In a general student assembly,
Stanford students yesterday after
noon were introduced to their 26
nominees who seek election in next
Tuesday's A.S.S.U, election.
Noticeably absent from the get
together were five men, who by their
absence signified that they "did not
choose to run."
The declinations were Albert T.
Henley (for graduate man on Ex
com), Bayard Collier, Ken Jones,
and Bob Laverty (all for assistant
yell leader posts), and Bud Ames
(junior man on Excom), who de
clined because his nomination had
been made without his knowledge.
NEW POLL SYSTEM
Introductions were in the hands
of Bruce Jessup, A.S.S.U. president,
who pointed out and named each
candidate. The meeting closed with
an important message by Betty
Moses, nominating committee chair
man, who explained the new polling
system which will be instituted in
this election.
Tuesday, four polling places will
be placed about the Quad â€”on Eng
lish Corner, on Engineering Corner,
on inner Quad, and on Psychology
Corner. Each student voting may go
to any one of these four polls,
where he must sign a voting blank
and have his student body card
punched.
PROVIDES CIIECK-UP
"This new system has been created
for two reasons," Betty Moses ex
plained. "First, it will enable
campus organizations to check who
and how many of their members
have voted. And second, your sign
ing will enable poll officials to check
that signature with the signature on
your student body card.
"This will prevent any transfer of
student body cards."
Any further declinations may be
made by signing an official declina
tion blank by noon today. These
blanks may be obtained at the
A.S.S.U. office.
"I also want to thank Nominating
Committee, the Election Board, and
the special election committee for
the fine work they have been doing
to date," Betty Moses concluded.
