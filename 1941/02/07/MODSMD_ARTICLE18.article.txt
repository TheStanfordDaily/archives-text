# Total German Control Over Vichy Threatened As New Crisis Looms
## British Plead For Passage Of Lease Bill 
### 
NEW YORK, Feb. 6 (UP). â€” A
warning that Adolf Hitler may es
tablish gaulcitcr rule over France
unless the Vichy government quick
ly accepts Pierre Laval as its leader
highlighted the Franco-German
crisis Thursday night.
The Vichy regime, however, pre
pared to offer Laval his former post
as vice-premier, with Admiral Fran
cois Darlan assuming direet control
of the government as premier and
Marshal Henri Philippe Petain re
maining only as titular chief of
state.
Armed with a threat to send the
formidable French fleet to Africa
beyond Germany's reach, Darlan ar
rived in Pax-is Thursday night to
seek a compromise on the Nazi
supported demands which would in
stall Laval as virtual dictator of
France. There was belief in many
quarters in Vichy that Laval would
reject the proposal that he return to
the French government in a sec
ondary role.
PETAIN OUSTER SEEN
A spokesman for the Nazi-sup
ported French party of national pop
ular concentration in Paris de
manded that the French government
return there with Laval as its chief
authority, leaving Petain as a figure
head.
President Roosevelt's attitude of
all-out aid to Britain and Italy's
military defeats were alleged to
have "influenced" Petain's opposi
tion to Laval's proposals.
