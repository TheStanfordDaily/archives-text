crew.)

IT IS ulmost exactly a year since a
group of rowing enthusiasts be
gan work on a training scow that
was to be the first step toward
bringing crew back to Stanford.
Last Sunday the work of the
Boat Club was completed, and
though the crew has neither
asked for nor rcccivcd support of
any kind from the school, it will
nevertheless enter competition this
spring, marking the first time that
the Stanford colors have been seen
on the water since 1922.
Astronomical figures of all sorts
were quoted by various sources as
to the amount that it would take to
start the sport, but mainly due to
the fine work of Carl Gerlach, the
crew was able to build its scow,
boat house, and launching raft on
the money collected from member
ship fees and small contributions of
old crew alumni who wished to see
the sport re-established at Stan
ford.
Two of the main objections to
starting crew were such expenses as
transportation to Redwood City, and
the purchase of a powerful motor
launch for coaching purposes.
The club members have supplied
their own transportation, and are re
imbursed by the club treasury for
the gas used during the quarter.
The coaching launch was secured
through the efforts of Nemo Peder
sen, one of the coaches, and is
loaned to the crew by W. A. Gould
of Mountain View. Gas and oil are
being supplied by a group of crew
alumni in San Francisco.
Since the crew received gym
credit, a group of some 20 oarsmen
have been working out three times
a week, with many informal prac
tices held besides. Enthusiasm is
high, and the members of the club
are looking forward to their first
races.

/COMPETITION will be tough for
an inexperienced crcw, but the
oarsmen hope to spring many a sur
prise in their first season.
Four rates have been definitely
fixed. On April 18 the crew will
enter a triangular meet on the
Oakland Estuary with Sacramento
J.C. and the Washington light
weight crew. On April 2G the crew
will race Compton J.C. May 17
the crcw will travel south to meet
one of the U.C.L.A. crews, and on
May 17 the last race of the sea
son will he held either at Sacra
mento or on the Estuary.
Coaching is at present in the hands
of four former crew men from Cali
fornia: Kirk Smith, stroke of the
champion Bear crcw of 1939, Stan
Freeborn, of the '39 and '40 crews,
and Fred Kelley, all of whom are
attending graduate schools at Stan
ford. Nemo Pedersen, the fourth
coach, lives in Palo Alto.
The Boat CI lilt's treasury is at
present in the healthiest condi
tion it has ever been in, and there
is a good chance that another
shell will be secured before spring
rowing starts.
With its initial organization en
tirely complete, the club members
can now enjoy the fruits of their
labors by taking daily five-mile
rows.
