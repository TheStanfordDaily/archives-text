# Stanford Nine Tackles Athens
## 
### 
Sunken Diamond is pretty well
flooded with yesterday's rain, but
the Cardinal varsity flyhawks will
attempt to play off their scheduled
tilt with the Athens Athletic Club
tomorrow at 2:30.
If the poor weather doesn't relent
by then, Coach Harry Wolter's nine
will get a lay-off until Monday,
when they meet Kenneally's Seals
for a third time.
With their first league tiff slated
for March 1 with Santa Clara, the
Indians aren't getting much of a
break as far as the weather goes, but
Wolter hopes to get in at least five
more games before the Bronco en
gagement.
Gaddini's All-Stars will play here
Wednesday, the Maher Paint Com
pany nine Feb. 22, and San Jose
State College Feb. 25.
Frosh Baseball Coach Harry Ship
key has scheduled a game with Bal
boa today for his yearling outfit,
but it's a million to one that the
game will not be played, due to the
very poor condition of the field.
