SAN ANTONIO. Tex., Feb. 6 (UP).
â€”A dark horse Texan, 28-year-old
Charley Klein, New Braunsfels pro,
was crowding the nation's stars to
night as a favorite in the $5,000
Texas open. He tied for $100 first
money in today's pro-amateur com
petition over the tough Willow
Springs course.
A pair of men's and women's
champions, Lawson Little and Betty

ball 64 in the tie.
