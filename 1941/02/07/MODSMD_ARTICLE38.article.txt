# Card Tankmen To Meet S.F. 'Y'
## 
### 
Stanford's swimming team will
meet the San Francisco Centra)
Y.M.C.A. in their first big event of
the season. Saturday night in San
Francisco.
Scheduled to begin at 8:30 o'clock,
the meet will be a battle of giants,
for both teams are good. Stanford
is the logical choice to win the Pa
cific Coast championship, and the
"Y" has high hopes of winning the
Y.M.C.A. national championship this
spring.
According to Coach Norton Thorn
ton, the meet will be close, every
thing depending on the relay. Go
ing by comparative limes, the "Y"
has the very slight edge of three
fifths of a second, but Stanford is
expected to make up this hand
breadth difference swimming against
superior competition.
Ray Vitousek is expected to win
the 50- and 100-yard events without
much trouble, having made the fast
est time in the nation this year with
54 seconds flat. The backstroke is
all Stanford's too, with Bill Weeden
and "Doc" Colyear both clocked at
well over 8 seconds under any of
the "Y" swimmers' best times in the
150.
