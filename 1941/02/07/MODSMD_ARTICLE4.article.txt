# Daisy Maes, 600 Strong, to Turn Tables Tonight
## Gaieties' 'Six Hits' To Entertain at Hop In Intermission Time 
### 
Farm Daisy Maes, 600 of 'em with
Li'l Abners in tow, will for the sec
ond official time assume the social
initiative tonight as they converge
on the Women's Gym at 9:30 o'clock
for the Sadie Hawkins Hop.
A last-minute announcement
from Chairman Pat Adams revealed
that "Six Hits and a Dent," the suc
cessful sextet of last year's Gaieties
will be among the intermission en
tertainers. The group is comprised
of Elena Bruton, Bill Quinn, Stan
Vanderburgh, Craig Stevenson,
Jack Shaw, Tommy Howard, and
Tom Crellin.
PATIO WAXED
To accommodate the 1200 people
expected at the hop, the Gym patio
will be waxed for dancing and fit
ted up with a public address system.
The crowd of comic-strip dancers
will be supplied with licorice sticks,
horns, whistles and coi-n-cob pipes,
according to further word from
Chairman Adams. Cokes will be on
sale for five cents instead of the
usual ten, as a special concession to
Daisy Maes experiencing difficulty
with the evening's budget.
McCUE AND BAND
Art McCue and his band, who will
be dressed as befits the occasion, are
expected to have their own vocal
ist with them, in addition to the
many other entertainers being re
cruited from the Gaieties.
Speculation was still rife among
the socially-elect males going to the
dance as to what kind of escorts
Farm Daisy Maes will turn out to
be. Informal surveys reveal a naive
curiosity concerning the amount to
be spent and after-the-dance diver
sion.
The hop will conclude at 1 o'clock
and Stanford women will have an
other year ahead of them to think
of prospective dates for next year's
"turnabout."

will be waxed for dancing and fit
ted up with a public address system.
The crowd of comic-strip dancers
will be supplied with licorice sticks,
horns, whistles and coi-n-cob pipes,
according to further word from
Chairman Adams. Cokes will be on
sale for five cents instead of the
usual ten, as a special concession to
Daisy Maes experiencing difficulty
with the evening's budget.
McCUE AND BAND
Art McCue and his band, who will
be dressed as befits the occasion, are
expected to have their own vocal
ist with them, in addition to the
many other entertainers being re
cruited from the Gaieties.
Speculation was still rife among
the socially-elect males going to the
dance as to what kind of escorts
Farm Daisy Maes will turn out to
be. Informal surveys reveal a naive
curiosity concerning the amount to
be spent and after-the-dance diver
sion.
The hop will conclude at 1 o'clock
and Stanford women will have an
other year ahead of them to think
of prospective dates for next year's
"turnabout."
