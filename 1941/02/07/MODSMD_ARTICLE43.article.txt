NOW is the time for all good men to come to
the aid of the party. Now is the time for
all good men to come to the aid of the party.
Now is the time for . . .
Typing practice? Could be . . . but with mid
year elections a step over the weekend, instead
it is the song that Row and Hall political solons
are dinning into the ears of the campus elec
torate.
It's getting near that stage of the game where
dark-hatted figures glide between living groups
garnering support for Joe Zilch and the rest of
the boys.
But there's one "minor" item which yearly
causes political wiseacres to bow their heads
in grief.
The boys and girls just won't bother to vote.
Over the past five years an average of
slightly less than one-half of the student body
has elected the campus student officers. The
other 51 per cent didn't cast a ballot.
"A representative cross-section" of the Farm
elect our student officers ... to paraphrase the
terminology of the national pollsters.
Without exception, today's student officials,
as well as those of the past five years, are men
and women of the highest caliber. There's no
beef there. The beef comes with the realiza
tion that these officers reach their positions
through the support of an appallingly scanty
portion of the student electorate.
When less than one-half of the boys and girls
go to the polls, it takes a surprisingly small frac
tion of the entire student body to landslide an
applicant into office.
When the national electorate gathers once
every four years to choose the highest officer of
our nation seldom does more than half of this
group use its voting privilege. This is hardly
surprising when the heterogeneous, hurly-burly
mixture of this group is taken into considera
tion.
But it's discouraging when a compact, closely
knit student body at one of the nation's leading
universities shows even less enthusiasm in
choosing its own officers.
And instead lets the afore-mentioned "repre
sentative cross-section" do it for them.
At a recent session Excom wishfully extended
the election balloting hours and increased the
number of ballot boxes . . . hoping that would
ease the problem.
Other possible solutions come to mind. Bet
ter publicity including a "picture-board" of can
didates so that the campus would become more
aware of who the candidates actually are. Per
haps a rejuvenation of the old system under
which candidates toured key-living groups in
a body . . . again with the "know your candi
date" theory in mind.
It's a helluva note as is.—W. C.

Without exception, today's student officials,
as well as those of the past five years, are men
and women of the highest caliber. There's no
beef there. The beef comes with the realiza

through the support of an appallingly scanty
portion of the student electorate.
When less than one-half of the boys and girls
go to the polls, it takes a surprisingly small frac

applicant into office.
When the national electorate gathers once
every four years to choose the highest officer of
our nation seldom does more than half of this
group use its voting privilege. This is hardly
surprising when the heterogeneous, hurly-burly
mixture of this group is taken into considera

But it's discouraging when a compact, closely
knit student body at one of the nation's leading
universities shows even less enthusiasm in
choosing its own officers.
And instead lets the afore-mentioned "repre
