# A 						Renewed Education
## 
### 
THE Stanford Alumni Association will offi
cially begin the "First Fifty Years" celebra
tion this week-end with a series of events de
signed to draw old grads from near and far back
to the Quad.
If the speeches and symposia don't pack Me
morial Hall, nothing will. After a welcoming
address by Frank Walker, the University's new
financial vice-president, alumni will hear a
panel discussion of the topic, "Where Does

America Go from Here?" History Professor
Thomas Bailey will preside, and participants
will include Royce Brier of the San Francisco
Chronicle, Philip Buck, Graham Stuart, Charles
Fairman, John Masland, Karl Brandt, Joseph S.
Davis, Paul Eliel, and Bernard Haley.
Albert Guerard will discuss the "Future of
the Arts under Totalitarianism"; Coach Clark
Shaughnessy will handle "Development of a
Successful Football Team," and other specific
scientific and religious themes will be dealt with
by professors who are eminently qualified as
authorities in the field.
From the registration on Saturday afternoon
to the final event, a banquet on Sunday night
with Dr. Wilbur as principal speaker, the Con
ference should serve to emphasize the ties that
bind together the Stanford Family. At the same
time it will offer an unparalleled opportunity to
gain an increased knowledge of recent learning
and the effects of world conflict on educational
and cultural processes. The renewing of old
acquaintances will not, obviously, be over
looked, either.
If the parade of activities that the Fiftieth Year
committee has scheduled for 1941 can compare
favorably with this opening affair, the success
of the project is already assured.
