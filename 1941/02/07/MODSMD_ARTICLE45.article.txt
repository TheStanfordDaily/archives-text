CONVERSATIONAL STEW
CONVERSATIONS and gab-fests are just like so
many pounds of Union stew. Every day it's shov
eled up in heaping helpings. You look at it for a
while and obviously it must be stew. But what parts
make life interesting, you wonder.
So you take your fork and pick around under the
bumps and hunks, and pick out the tidbits that look
the best.
Well, conversationally speaking, that is just what
has been done with a scramble of varied conversation
spread over the past few days. And out of the con
versational stew has come these choicer tidbits.

J7LASH. Exclusive to the campus. What certain vice
president of what certain Stanford student body
got left on a certain country road a couple of notes
a g°— an d didn't get home until 4 o'clock in the
morning?
The story goes that this raven-haired miss was out
driving on one of those country roads with a date last
week-end. (The usual questions omitted.) Suddenly
the car broke down. What to do? There was a lock
out to meet. Well, go to the nearest telephone and
call for help, of course.
But the guy didn't have a nickel to call with. Not
a thin nickel.
So there they were, a million miles from nowhere.
And they didn't get home until 4 o'clock.
* * * *
JpLASH. Exclusive to the Daily. Two Farmers were
sitting in their respective beds in the Men's Rest
Home. Down there they take your temperature at
the drop of a flu victim—about once every hour.
Came temperature time. There the two sat, each
with a thermometer in his mouth. The nurse leaves
for a quick one. One man pulls out the thermometer
and rubs it briskly against the blanket for a moment.
Then back into the mouth.
As the nurse comes back into the room he says,
"Gosh, I feel kinda hot."
"Nonsense," says the nurse, and glances casually at
the temperature tube.
Which reads 105. The nurse suspects an epidemic.
* * * *
Exclusive to The Daily. As students file
into the Marriage class, they are handed a pagey
mimeographed exam. Everybody hurries to seat, and
begins looking over the questions.
Silence. Only the hushed rustle of examination
papers.
Then suddenly a girl begins to laugh. Her un
checked chuckles shake the auditorium.
And everybody starts rustling back through the
questions, looking for the "good one" she is laughing
at.

Exclusive to The Daily. As students file
into the Marriage class, they are handed a pagey
mimeographed exam. Everybody hurries to seat, and
begins looking over the questions.
Silence. Only the hushed rustle of examination
papers.
Then suddenly a girl begins to laugh. Her un
checked chuckles shake the auditorium.
And everybody starts rustling back through the
questions, looking for the "good one" she is laughing
at.
CONVERSATIONAL STEW
CONVERSATIONS and gab-fests are just like so
many pounds of Union stew. Every day it's shov
eled up in heaping helpings. You look at it for a
while and obviously it must be stew. But what parts
make life interesting, you wonder.
So you take your fork and pick around under the
bumps and hunks, and pick out the tidbits that look
the best.
Well, conversationally speaking, that is just what
has been done with a scramble of varied conversation
spread over the past few days. And out of the con
versational stew has come these choicer tidbits.

J7LASH. Exclusive to the campus. What certain vice
president of what certain Stanford student body
got left on a certain country road a couple of notes
a g°— an d didn't get home until 4 o'clock in the
morning?
The story goes that this raven-haired miss was out
driving on one of those country roads with a date last
week-end. (The usual questions omitted.) Suddenly
the car broke down. What to do? There was a lock
out to meet. Well, go to the nearest telephone and
call for help, of course.
But the guy didn't have a nickel to call with. Not
a thin nickel.
So there they were, a million miles from nowhere.
And they didn't get home until 4 o'clock.

JpLASH. Exclusive to the Daily. Two Farmers were
sitting in their respective beds in the Men's Rest
Home. Down there they take your temperature at
the drop of a flu victim—about once every hour.
Came temperature time. There the two sat, each
with a thermometer in his mouth. The nurse leaves
for a quick one. One man pulls out the thermometer
and rubs it briskly against the blanket for a moment.
Then back into the mouth.
As the nurse comes back into the room he says,
"Gosh, I feel kinda hot."
"Nonsense," says the nurse, and glances casually at
the temperature tube.
Which reads 105. The nurse suspects an epidemic.
