r jpHE EDITOR, SIR:
Lately there has been a lot of comment on the
Union Cellar and most of them from the same source.
I am saying nothing against Mr. Ames' column, but
against his ideas.
First he started out with the Cellar cofTee. What
he has against the cofTee I don't know, but he has
made some remarks on that subject. I am here to say
that Cellar cofTee is made of nothing but pure un
adulterated cofTee beans, and good old Stanford water.
The fact that a few of the beans might have been
missed in the grinding shouldn't hurt the quality of
the cofTee.
Then there was the comment about the black specs
in the coke glasses. This was a trivial matter which
Mr. Ames made into one of great proportions. The
Cellar does everything to keep the coke glasses clean
and sanitary and if there are any black specs in the
bottom of the glasses they get there by themselves.
This brings us to the last and I hope final bit of
Cellar gossip. The case of "The slug in the cheese."
I am not trying to deny the fact that the slug was
there, but I am on the side of the Cellar. Can they
help it if a worm crawls into a cheese at the factory
and is later deposited in a sandwich? Or perhaps the
worm liked to eat cheese. At any rate, the Cellar had
nothing to do with it.
To rephrase an old subject I might add, you can't
please all the people all of the time. The Cellar tries
to hit a happy medium and everybody is dissatisisfied.

EDITOR, SIR:
I have just given to a current charity drive. Un
willingly.
During this drive I was approached with sob
stories; in front of a group of people; privately;
threateningly; and in various other sundry ways.
I like to make my own decisions as to what charity
I'm going to contribute to, and how much. If I prefer
to give to a less publicized relief fund, I think it un
fair to have to say "no" more than once to a well
known organization. Or vice versa.
Why are these dozen or more drives for money (or
time) so rude and peremptory? Don't the people ask
ing for contributions realize that their attitude is so
antagonizing that by the time Spring Quarter and its
worth while drives come along, some of us are going
to be so sick of the whole thing that we're going to
turn against all charities.
And I don't see why I have to sign my name.
After all, maybe you're in charge of the next drive,
and then where would I be?
