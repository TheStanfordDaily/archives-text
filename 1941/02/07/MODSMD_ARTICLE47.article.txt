# A 						FEW SECONDS BEFORE DEATH

THIS PHOTO, taken by Mrs. G. M. Berger of her mother, Mrs. W. C.
Nemitz of Oakland, was a prelude to tragedy. The older woman
waded in the surf at Half Moon Bay and stood ankle-deep in the
water while her daughter took snap-shots of her. Suddenly a huge
breaker knocked Mrs. Nemitz oIT her feet and swept her out of
sight. The body was discovered later by a Coast Guardsman.
