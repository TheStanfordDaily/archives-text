# Stanford Fund Callers To Begin Visits Feb. 18
## 
### 
Knocking at the doors of some 1300 homes of Palo Alto alumni and
friends of the University beginning Feb. 18 will be 160 Stanford students
who have been enlisted to conduct the 1941 Family Call.
These student callers are in charge of carrying the Stanford Fund's
Family Call directly to the doors of the alumni and friends. They repre-

.sent the students' participation in
the Fund's program in which all
branches of Stanford's Family fac
ulty, alumni, friends, and studentsâ€”
take part.
The students' work in the program
is sponsored by the A.S.S.U. and is
directed by a hierarchy of cam
paigners, headed by the Student
Family Council of five.
AIDES AND CALLERS
The council is assisted by 16 aides
and each aide is responsible for en
listing 10 callers. The callers,
working in couples, will call on the
homes of alumni and friends of the
University whose names and ad
dresses are listed on prospect cards.
The 1941 Call will begin Feb. 18
following a dinner for all partici
pants given by the Stanford Fund
Committee at the Union.
LIVING ENDOWMENT'
The Stanford Fund is a plan or
ganized by alumni and friends of
Stanford which seeks to aid the
University by an annual gift from
every one of its alumni and friends.
Gifts are not sought as additions to
the endowment, but as additions to
the yearly income. It is thus called
a living endowment program.
"Combined with the 50th Year
Celebration, this year's drive prom
ises to attract more student inter
est. and should be more successful
than drives in the past," Bob Newell,
chairman of the council, reports.

Other members of the council and
aides include Jeanne Chambers,
Mary Jean Haynes, Widney Watson,
Virginia Dean, Georgiana Dole,
Rosamond Upson, Lois Whitmore,
and Ruthelen List.

Whittlesey, Bud Billings, George
Jackson, Oliver Hamlin, Bill Turner,

mann, Jack Burns, John Moore, and

sistant director of the Stanford
Fund, advises the Council.
