Prime Minister Winston
Churchill broadcast to the peo
ple of the United States yesterday
"to give us the tools and we will
finish the job," the British armed |
forces smashed out spectacular vic
tories over Italy in the Mediter- i
ranean.
Among Britain's military achieve
ments for the day was a naval
bombardment of the port of Genoa,
which previously had been attacked
only from the air by planes flying
all the way from bases in the Brit
ish Isles.
But it was Churchill's speech
that drew the mast attention in
Washington and the most com
ment in the American press.
Although the consensus in
Washingotn indicated Churchill's
broadcast was not likely to influ
ence Senate action on the lend
lease bill now before that body,
the words of the British Prime
Minister did provoke striking
statements from a number of
Senators.
Senator Burton K. Wheeler, vio
lent critic of the bill, pointed out
that Britain during the World War
did not want America to send
troops abroad but that we finally
did send an expeditionary force to
the battlefields of France.
"If we aren't going to send
American boys abroad why are we
buying 4,500,000 identification tags?
Why are we buying 1,500,000 cas
kets?" His remarks evidently were
made in reference to recent orders
placed by the Office for Production
Management.

W/TIEELER declared he had little
faith in Churchill's assertions
that Britain does "not need the gal
lant armies which are forming in the
United States — not this year, not
next year, nor any other year that
I can foresee."
Proponents of the British-aid
measure called the British Prime
Minister's talk "reassuring" and
"magnificent."
Senator Carter Glass, veteran
Virginia Democrat who has op
posed the Administration on nu
merous occasions during the past
two years, has been a constant
advocate of the hill and his re
marks yesterday were as strong in
favor of the bill as Wheeler's were
against the same measure.
Glass, referring to Churchill's
broadcast, declared "it's a damn
sight better speech than anyone in
the Senate will make against the
lend-lease hill."
Another Senator said he was not
surprised by Churchill's statement
about need of American troops "be
cause all experienced observers
have known this all along.
"Germany has extended her lines
more and more and now needs nine
times more man power than Britain
requires to press an offensive," he
said.
While praising Churchill's speech,
another Senator asserted Britain had
"no right to expect that we'd send
troops abroad."

Francois Darlan, com
promise candidate to head the
French government in Vichy, yes
terday was appointed vice-premier
by Marshal Petain in a move that is
expected to permit the return of
pro-Nazi Pierre Laval to the Cabi
net in the near future.
Darlan will have in his hands the
duties of foreign minister as well as
those of vice-premier in the new
set-up. Laval has wanted this post.
According to the official com
munique of the Petain regime, the
cabinet move was made after La
val refused to consent to Petain's
suggested compromise of the
eight-weeks-old dispute. The res
ignation of Pierre-Etienne Flandin
made Darlan's appointment to the
vice-premiership possible.
But observers in Vichy and in
Paris look upon the Cabinet shift
as no better than a stop-gap move.
Petain, under pressure from Laval's
Nazi-supported followers in Paris,
might have refused entirely Laval's
demands or he might have acceded
and permitted Laval to take over
the government.
Petain attempted to reach a
compromise agreement and he has
declared he will take a back scat
role in the Cabinet.

Darlan will have in his hands the

According to the official com

Petain, under pressure from Laval's

that Britain does "not need the gal
lant armies which are forming in the
United States — not this year, not
next year, nor any other year that
I can foresee."
Proponents of the British-aid
measure called the British Prime
Minister's talk "reassuring" and
"magnificent."
Senator Carter Glass, veteran
Virginia Democrat who has op
posed the Administration on nu
merous occasions during the past
two years, has been a constant
advocate of the hill and his re
marks yesterday were as strong in
favor of the bill as Wheeler's were
against the same measure.
Glass, referring to Churchill's
broadcast, declared "it's a damn
sight better speech than anyone in
the Senate will make against the
lend-lease hill."
Another Senator said he was not
surprised by Churchill's statement
about need of American troops "be
cause all experienced observers
have known this all along.
"Germany has extended her lines
more and more and now needs nine
times more man power than Britain
requires to press an offensive," he
said.
While praising Churchill's speech,
another Senator asserted Britain had
"no right to expect that we'd send
troops abroad."

Francois Darlan, com
promise candidate to head the
French government in Vichy, yes
terday was appointed vice-premier
by Marshal Petain in a move that is
expected to permit the return of
pro-Nazi Pierre Laval to the Cabi
net in the near future.
Darlan will have in his hands the
duties of foreign minister as well as
those of vice-premier in the new
set-up. Laval has wanted this post.
According to the official com
munique of the Petain regime, the
cabinet move was made after La
val refused to consent to Petain's
suggested compromise of the
eight-weeks-old dispute. The res
ignation of Pierre-Etienne Flandin
made Darlan's appointment to the
vice-premiership possible.
But observers in Vichy and in
Paris look upon the Cabinet shift
as no better than a stop-gap move.
Petain, under pressure from Laval's
Nazi-supported followers in Paris,
might have refused entirely Laval's
demands or he might have acceded
and permitted Laval to take over
the government.
Petain attempted to reach a
compromise agreement and he has
declared he will take a back scat
role in the Cabinet.
Prime Minister Winston
Churchill broadcast to the peo
ple of the United States yesterday
"to give us the tools and we will
finish the job," the British armed |
forces smashed out spectacular vic
tories over Italy in the Mediter- i
ranean.
Among Britain's military achieve
ments for the day was a naval
bombardment of the port of Genoa,
which previously had been attacked
only from the air by planes flying
all the way from bases in the Brit
ish Isles.
But it was Churchill's speech
that drew the mast attention in
Washington and the most com
ment in the American press.
Although the consensus in
Washingotn indicated Churchill's
broadcast was not likely to influ
ence Senate action on the lend
lease bill now before that body,
the words of the British Prime
Minister did provoke striking
statements from a number of
Senators.
Senator Burton K. Wheeler, vio
lent critic of the bill, pointed out
that Britain during the World War
did not want America to send
troops abroad but that we finally
did send an expeditionary force to
the battlefields of France.
"If we aren't going to send
American boys abroad why are we
buying 4,500,000 identification tags?
Why are we buying 1,500,000 cas
kets?" His remarks evidently were
made in reference to recent orders
placed by the Office for Production
Management.
