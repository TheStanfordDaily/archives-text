## 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
Stanford's "T" formation is the
major topic of conversation today in
football circles throughout the
country—and that's a direct state
ment from The Man Who Knows.
Coach Clark Shaughnessy, named
the "Coach of the Year" at a De
troit alumni banquet and the only
man ever to drive a Model T into
the Rose Bowl, made this statement
yesterday following his return from
a two weeks' trip throughout the
East, with stops at 10 major cities.
"How good is it and how can you
stop it?" are the questions with
which football enthusiasts pummeled
Coach Shaughnessy every time he
turned around on his nationwide
junket.
Asked yesterday if he plans to
use the "T" formation again next
season, he took a wide trip around
Robin Hood's barn and wound up
with "Probably, but not for certain."
The Coach of the Year's itinerary
included stops at Chicago, Detroit,
and Philadelphia for alumni ban
quets, and New York, Washington,
Omaha, Kansas City, St. Louis, Co
lumbia, Mo., and Sioux Falls, S.D.
He visited his daughter at Columbia,
who is a student at Stephens Col
lege.
At the Detroit banquet, attended
by 1500, he was awarded the "Coach
of the Year" plaque, similar to the
one formerly presented by the New
York World.
In Philadelphia the Cardinal men
tor was honored by the Philadelphia
Sports Writers Association at a
banquet attended by 2000, including
sports celebrities from every section
of the nation. In New York he vis
ited old friends.
"I was very much pleased with
the interest of the Stanford alumni,
who were wonderful, and I was
glad to meet them," he said.
Coach Shaughnessy stated spring
practice will start about April 1 and,
asked if he has been working on
plays for next year, he answered la
conically, "No time."
In answer to the question, "Will
you have the same assistant coaches
next season?" he smiled quickly and
said, "Sure."
Asked to pick the most outstand
ing reason for his success last sea
son, he said, without hesitating,
"Good kids," the boys on the team.
Before spring practice gets under
way he will travel to Los Angeles,
Feb. 13, to appear before alumni and
will make several other Coast trips.

Stanford's "T" formation is the
major topic of conversation today in
football circles throughout the
country—and that's a direct state
ment from The Man Who Knows.
Coach Clark Shaughnessy, named
the "Coach of the Year" at a De
troit alumni banquet and the only
man ever to drive a Model T into
the Rose Bowl, made this statement
yesterday following his return from
a two weeks' trip throughout the
East, with stops at 10 major cities.
"How good is it and how can you
stop it?" are the questions with
which football enthusiasts pummeled
Coach Shaughnessy every time he
turned around on his nationwide
junket.
Asked yesterday if he plans to
use the "T" formation again next
season, he took a wide trip around
Robin Hood's barn and wound up
with "Probably, but not for certain."
The Coach of the Year's itinerary
included stops at Chicago, Detroit,
and Philadelphia for alumni ban
quets, and New York, Washington,
Omaha, Kansas City, St. Louis, Co
lumbia, Mo., and Sioux Falls, S.D.
He visited his daughter at Columbia,
