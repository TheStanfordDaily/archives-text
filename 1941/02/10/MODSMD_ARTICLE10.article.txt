# Shaughnessy Says 'T' Still Talk of Town
## 
### HAROLD SHAFER 
Stanford's "T" formation is the
major topic of conversation today in
football circles throughout the
country—and that's a direct state
ment from The Man Who Knows.
Coach Clark Shaughnessy, named
the "Coach of the Year" at a De
troit alumni banquet and the only
man ever to drive a Model T into
the Rose Bowl, made this statement
yesterday following his return from
a two weeks' trip throughout the
East, with stops at 10 major cities.
"How good is it and how can you
stop it?" are the questions with
which football enthusiasts pummeled
Coach Shaughnessy every time he
turned around on his nationwide
junket.
Asked yesterday if he plans to
use the "T" formation again next
season, he took a wide trip around
Robin Hood's barn and wound up
with "Probably, but not for certain."
The Coach of the Year's itinerary
included stops at Chicago, Detroit,
and Philadelphia for alumni ban
quets, and New York, Washington,
Omaha, Kansas City, St. Louis, Co
lumbia, Mo., and Sioux Falls, S.D.
He visited his daughter at Columbia,
who is a student at Stephens Col
lege.
