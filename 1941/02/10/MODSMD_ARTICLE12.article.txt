# Wilbur Urges Freedom Fight
## Blasts Possibility Of Individuality Loss 
### 
Heatedly proclaiming for freedom
of opoprtunity in the university and
for the individuality of man, Presi
dent Ray Lyman Wilbur, '96, last
night warned that "Above all there
must be an atmosphere of freedom
in Stanford and other universities
. . . even though we have to fight
for it."
Addressing over 400 members of
the Stanford Family at the Alumni
Conference concluding banquet, for
what was perhaps his last speech to
alumni as President of the Univer
sity, Dr. Wilbur observed that com
pulsory military training is all right
if necessary to preserve democracy,
"but it's a terrible price to pay."
"Who invented the airplane? Was
it the Wright brothers or was it a
Nazi? Who invented the electric
light—was it one of Mussolini's men
or was it Edison?" he demanded.
"Out of a democracy come the
great ideas of great men that have
now become so important in the age
of science," he said.
Sporting a patriotic, large red car
nation, the University President, who
has received honorary degrees from
20 colleges and universities and three
foreign governments declared:
"Democracies that do not give uni
versities the right to make the dis
tinctions of quality and competition
will fail, and will go down to igno
minious failure. Intelligence seems
to have been telescoped."
On the speakers' table was a huge
double-decker birthday cake, the
first tier supporting 50 blazing
candles in honor ot Stanford's 50th
anniversary, and the second deck
bearing 25 candles proclaiming the
conclusion of Dr. Wilbur's quarter
ccntury of presidency.
