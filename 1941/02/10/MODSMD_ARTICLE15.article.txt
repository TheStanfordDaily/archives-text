# 'Y' TO OPEN FINANCE DRIVE
## Association Leaders Set Goal for $500 
### 
After house meetings tonight the
Y.W.C.A. annual finance drive will
officially start, it has been announced
by Martha Phillips, "Y" president.
It. is hoped that by this Friday $500
will have been deposited in the
"Y" coffers to help defray next year's
expenses.
If the expected goal is reached, the
money will be spent to contribute to
charitable organizations such as the
Stanford Convalescent Home, the
American Red Cross, the British War
Relief Society, and for social service
projects.
Some of the larger expenses of
the "Y," the salary of a trained
secretary, insurance, and furniture
and fixture costs, are paid for by
the Stanford Y.W.C.A. Advisory
