# Stanford Professors Favor War if British Defeat Near
## Pi Sigma Alpha Poll Shows Faculty Approves Lend-Lease Bill by 65 Pct. 
### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
The United Slates should declare war against Germany rather than
allow Great Britain to l>c defeated.
So believe (50 per cent of Stanford's professors polled in a foreign policy
survey conducted by Pi Sigma Alpha, national political science fraternity.
However, 91 per cent of the Farm faculty are against immediate decla
ration of war against Germany.
Of the three "aid to Britain" questions asked the professors, only one
was approved. Sixty-five per cent favor the "Lend-Lease" Bill as re-

ported from the House Foreign Af-,
fairs Committee. But a majority of
the professors disapprove of U.S.
merchant vessels transporting sup
plies to England and also say no to
a convoy of British merchant ves
sels by the American navy.
Although approving of aid to
Britain, 68 per cent of the faculty
believe this policy will lead to armed
participation on the part of the Uni
ted States.
A bare majority—s2 per cent —
believe the United States should not
fight Japan to prevent a Nipponese
occupation of the Dutch East Indies
or Singapore.
ALL FACULTY QUERIED
While all the faculty was asked
these questions, many professors
failed to answer the questionnaire.
The actual tabulation is as follows:
Yes No
If the U.S. must choose be
tween seeing Great Britain
forced to accept Hitler's
terms or entering the war,
do you favor our entrance? 91 63
Should the U.S. declare war
against Germany now?... 14 148
Should Congress enact the
"Lend-Lease" Bill as re
ported from the House
Foreign Affairs Commit
tee? 107 58
Should U.S. merchant ves
sels transport supplies to
Great Britain? 62 98
Do you believe that the U.S.
policy of granting aid short
of war will probably lead
to armed participation on
the part of the U.S.? 101 48
ANSWERS INCONSISTENT
An inconsistency of opinion in the
survey is seen by Donald Crawford,
who, with Ed Dole, was in charge
of the poll. "The survey reveals that
the professors think we should not
declare war, yet they believe we are
going to war because of our present
policies. They, nevertheless, support
these policies—the lend-lease bill—
but oppose the convoying of British
ships or the using of our own."
Significant is the comparison of
the faculty poll with the .student
sux'vey recently conducted by The
Daily. Seventy-four per cent ap
proved of the "lend-lease" bill, while
65 per cent of the faculty also fa
vored the measure.
In addition, 72 per cent of the
students and (38 per cent of the fac
ulty believe the United States will
enter the war.
PROFESSORS COMMENT
A few of the professors' comments
are as follows:
"To hell with Hitler and you don't
need to keep it secret." "Convoy
ships, if necessary."
"The disadvantages of declaring
war now seem to me to far out
weigh any likely advantages."
"Morally, war has been declared;
technically, it does not matter."
"Due to the official position of the
military service of the
the members of the military depart
ment at Stanford are not privileged
to debate questions of future mili
tary policy."

policy of granting aid short
of war will probably lead
to armed participation on
the part of the U.S.? 101 48
ANSWERS INCONSISTENT
An inconsistency of opinion in the
survey is seen by Donald Crawford,
who, with Ed Dole, was in charge
of the poll. "The survey reveals that
the professors think we should not
declare war, yet they believe we are
going to war because of our present
policies. They, nevertheless, support
these policies—the lend-lease bill—
but oppose the convoying of British
ships or the using of our own."
Significant is the comparison of
the faculty poll with the .student
sux'vey recently conducted by The
Daily. Seventy-four per cent ap
proved of the "lend-lease" bill, while
65 per cent of the faculty also fa
vored the measure.
In addition, 72 per cent of the
students and (38 per cent of the fac
ulty believe the United States will
enter the war.
PROFESSORS COMMENT
A few of the professors' comments
are as follows:
"To hell with Hitler and you don't
need to keep it secret." "Convoy
ships, if necessary."
"The disadvantages of declaring
war now seem to me to far out
weigh any likely advantages."
"Morally, war has been declared;
technically, it does not matter."
"Due to the official position of the
military service of the
the members of the military depart
ment at Stanford are not privileged
to debate questions of future mili
tary policy."
The United Slates should declare war against Germany rather than
allow Great Britain to l>c defeated.
So believe (50 per cent of Stanford's professors polled in a foreign policy
survey conducted by Pi Sigma Alpha, national political science fraternity.
However, 91 per cent of the Farm faculty are against immediate decla
ration of war against Germany.
Of the three "aid to Britain" questions asked the professors, only one
was approved. Sixty-five per cent favor the "Lend-Lease" Bill as re-

ported from the House Foreign Af-,
fairs Committee. But a majority of
the professors disapprove of U.S.
merchant vessels transporting sup
plies to England and also say no to
a convoy of British merchant ves
sels by the American navy.
Although approving of aid to
Britain, 68 per cent of the faculty
believe this policy will lead to armed
participation on the part of the Uni
ted States.
A bare majority—s2 per cent —
believe the United States should not
fight Japan to prevent a Nipponese
occupation of the Dutch East Indies
or Singapore.
