# British Fleet Bombs Genoa In Bold Move
## Nile Army Continues Drive Across Libya; El Aghelia Captured

LONDON, Mon., Feb. 10 (UP).â€”
The British fleet, sweeping boldly
[up through the Ligurian Sea at
dawn Sunday, smashed the great
Italian port of Genoa with more
than .'5OO tons of shells and perhaps
saved Gen. Maxime Weygand's
French army in Africa from an im
minent German attack, it was stated
officially last night.
The docks of the Benito Musso
lini basin and the inner harbor of
Genoa are protected by two and one
half-mile Principe Umberto with a
narrow entrance at each end.
DISTRICTS HIT
Flanking the outer harbor are
crowded shop and tenement dis
tricts which may have been badly
hit.
Genoa's port facilities are among
the best anywhere in Italy and the
city has excellent railroad connec
tion with Germany by way of Bren
ner Pass, over which the Nazi expe
ditionary force spoken of by
Churchill probably would be moved.
Since the start of the war Genoa
has been attacked four times by long
range bombers of the Royal Air
Force, flying IGOO miles non-stop
across the Alps and back to bomb
their targets.
FLEET ELSEWHERE
Since the British Navy recently
"swept" the entire eastern Mediter
ranean without finding a trace of
the Italian fleet it is assumed here
that the Italian main forces are
somewhere along the west coast,
probably Sardinia.
The bombardment of Genoa fol
lowed a precedent set by the Brit
ish planes operating from aircraft
carriers badly battered the units of
the Italian fleet moored there.
