# Indian Cagers Down Cal, 49-42, to Strengthen Lead In Conference Standings
## 
### DON SELBY 
To all intents and purposes the Stanford cagers dropped the cham
pionship of the Southern Division of the P.C.C. in their own laps Friday
niyht in the Pavilion when they walked over the University of California
for the second time this season, 49-42, to move way cut in front in the
conference standings at the half-way mark.

Saturday night the second-string
ers took over for Stanford, and with
two minutes of help from Don Wil
liams, Fordy Anderson, and Bill
Cowden, managed to nose out the
U.S.F. Dons, 37-35. Coach Everett
Dean inserted the three regulars in
the last two minutes to protect
Stanford's slim lead. Not a point
was scored in the final two minutes.
While the Indians were rapping
the; Bears here Friday night, the
erstwhile U.S.C. greats were just
managing to nose out their cross-

town rivals, U.C.L.A., 43-41, in the
southland to force the Bruins down
into a tie with the Trojans for the
cellar spot in the league standings.
The Bears had the hot shots Fri
day night, John McGee and Roy
Tamm taking high scoring honors
with 17 and 16 points, respectively,
but Stanford had the basketball
team—and that was what counted.
Tamm and McGee potted a shot
apiece soon after the ball game got
under way to put the Bears into
an early lead at 4-0, but tallies by
Cowden, Anderson, and Kenny
Davidson shot the Indians into a
6-6 tie with Cal after McGee had
again hit the hoop on a field goal
attempt.
From that point on Cal never
once regained their lead, as Stan
ford controlled the ball game in a
manner that was definite and con
clusive. Throughout the game the
Indians were getting their shots
close to the basket by virtue of
their smooth offensive maneuvers,
while Cal men were forced to take
a great number of their shots from
20 or 25 feet out.
TOO MUCH FOR CAL
Stanford s fast break and dead
eye shooting was far too much for
the charges of Coach Nibs Price to
handle during that first half, and
the Indians' superiority is shown by
the half-time score of 25-15. The
Bears were taking almost as many
shots but their percentage of shots
made good was a far cry from that
of Stanford.
California threatened semi-se
riously several times in the second
half as the Bear attack speeded up
somewhat, but the Indians never al
lowed the margin of their lead to
get below four points which was the
difference after Tamm and McGee
rang up two points apiece to bring
the score to 38-34. But at this point
Stanford moved into another of
fensive formation with three men
out and the two forwards in the
corners, which was the signal for an
Indian scoring parade that didn't
let up until the Bears were a de
feated team.

The way Stanford played basket
hall Friday night was just a re
minder of what Coach Dean's cagers
can do when they are playing their
game. They were definite and
smooth, but most of all they were
basketball-wise. Combine these with
some better-than-average shooting
and you see why the Indians had
little trouble with Cal, their major
challenger for conference honors.
Saturday night's set-to with U.S.F.
found Coach Dean resting his regu
lars for their conference battles with
the Trojans next week-end and at
the same time giving playing time
to his reserves. He used a non
senior quintet most of the time,
probably with an eye toward next
season when Williams and Davidson
will be gone.

20 or 25 feet out.
TOO MUCH FOR CAL
Stanford s fast break and dead
eye shooting was far too much for
the charges of Coach Nibs Price to
handle during that first half, and
the Indians' superiority is shown by
the half-time score of 25-15. The
Bears were taking almost as many
shots but their percentage of shots
made good was a far cry from that
of Stanford.
California threatened semi-se
riously several times in the second
half as the Bear attack speeded up
somewhat, but the Indians never al
lowed the margin of their lead to
get below four points which was the
difference after Tamm and McGee
rang up two points apiece to bring
the score to 38-34. But at this point
Stanford moved into another of
fensive formation with three men
out and the two forwards in the
corners, which was the signal for an
Indian scoring parade that didn't
let up until the Bears were a de
feated team.

The way Stanford played basket
hall Friday night was just a re
minder of what Coach Dean's cagers
can do when they are playing their
game. They were definite and
smooth, but most of all they were
basketball-wise. Combine these with
some better-than-average shooting
and you see why the Indians had
little trouble with Cal, their major
challenger for conference honors.
Saturday night's set-to with U.S.F.
found Coach Dean resting his regu
lars for their conference battles with
the Trojans next week-end and at
the same time giving playing time
to his reserves. He used a non
senior quintet most of the time,
probably with an eye toward next
season when Williams and Davidson
will be gone.
To all intents and purposes the Stanford cagers dropped the cham
pionship of the Southern Division of the P.C.C. in their own laps Friday
niyht in the Pavilion when they walked over the University of California
for the second time this season, 49-42, to move way cut in front in the
conference standings at the half-way mark.

Saturday night the second-string
ers took over for Stanford, and with
two minutes of help from Don Wil
liams, Fordy Anderson, and Bill
Cowden, managed to nose out the
U.S.F. Dons, 37-35. Coach Everett
Dean inserted the three regulars in
the last two minutes to protect
Stanford's slim lead. Not a point
was scored in the final two minutes.
While the Indians were rapping
the; Bears here Friday night, the
erstwhile U.S.C. greats were just
managing to nose out their cross-

town rivals, U.C.L.A., 43-41, in the
southland to force the Bruins down
into a tie with the Trojans for the
cellar spot in the league standings.
The Bears had the hot shots Fri
day night, John McGee and Roy
Tamm taking high scoring honors
with 17 and 16 points, respectively,
but Stanford had the basketball
team—and that was what counted.
Tamm and McGee potted a shot
apiece soon after the ball game got
under way to put the Bears into
an early lead at 4-0, but tallies by
Cowden, Anderson, and Kenny
Davidson shot the Indians into a
6-6 tie with Cal after McGee had
again hit the hoop on a field goal
attempt.
From that point on Cal never
once regained their lead, as Stan
ford controlled the ball game in a
manner that was definite and con
clusive. Throughout the game the
Indians were getting their shots
close to the basket by virtue of
their smooth offensive maneuvers,
while Cal men were forced to take
a great number of their shots from
20 or 25 feet out.

for the second time this season, 49-42, to move way cut in front in the
conference standings at the half-way mark.

Saturday night the second-string
ers took over for Stanford, and with
two minutes of help from Don Wil
liams, Fordy Anderson, and Bill
Cowden, managed to nose out the
U.S.F. Dons, 37-35. Coach Everett
Dean inserted the three regulars in
the last two minutes to protect
Stanford's slim lead. Not a point
was scored in the final two minutes.
While the Indians were rapping
the; Bears here Friday night, the
erstwhile U.S.C. greats were just
managing to nose out their cross-

town rivals, U.C.L.A., 43-41, in the
southland to force the Bruins down
into a tie with the Trojans for the
cellar spot in the league standings.
The Bears had the hot shots Fri
day night, John McGee and Roy
Tamm taking high scoring honors
with 17 and 16 points, respectively,
but Stanford had the basketball
team—and that was what counted.
Tamm and McGee potted a shot
apiece soon after the ball game got
under way to put the Bears into
an early lead at 4-0, but tallies by
Cowden, Anderson, and Kenny
Davidson shot the Indians into a
6-6 tie with Cal after McGee had
again hit the hoop on a field goal
attempt.
From that point on Cal never
once regained their lead, as Stan
ford controlled the ball game in a
manner that was definite and con
clusive. Throughout the game the
Indians were getting their shots
close to the basket by virtue of
their smooth offensive maneuvers,
while Cal men were forced to take
a great number of their shots from
20 or 25 feet out.
TOO MUCH FOR CAL
Stanford s fast break and dead
eye shooting was far too much for
the charges of Coach Nibs Price to
handle during that first half, and
the Indians' superiority is shown by
the half-time score of 25-15. The
Bears were taking almost as many
shots but their percentage of shots
made good was a far cry from that
of Stanford.
California threatened semi-se
riously several times in the second
half as the Bear attack speeded up
somewhat, but the Indians never al
lowed the margin of their lead to
get below four points which was the
difference after Tamm and McGee
rang up two points apiece to bring
the score to 38-34. But at this point
Stanford moved into another of
fensive formation with three men
out and the two forwards in the
corners, which was the signal for an
Indian scoring parade that didn't
let up until the Bears were a de
feated team.
INDIANS HOT
The way Stanford played basket
hall Friday night was just a re
minder of what Coach Dean's cagers
can do when they are playing their
game. They were definite and
smooth, but most of all they were
basketball-wise. Combine these with
some better-than-average shooting
and you see why the Indians had
little trouble with Cal, their major
challenger for conference honors.
Saturday night's set-to with U.S.F.
found Coach Dean resting his regu
lars for their conference battles with
the Trojans next week-end and at
the same time giving playing time
to his reserves. He used a non
senior quintet most of the time,
probably with an eye toward next
season when Williams and Davidson
will be gone.
