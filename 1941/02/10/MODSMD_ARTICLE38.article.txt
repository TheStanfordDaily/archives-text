### JERRY BRUCKER 
A T THE basketball game Friday
night.
Wonder why Winkic Jones, wear
ing the armband of a B.A.C. cop,
was beefing with the Cal rooters
across the way before the game
started. Wink is a pretty rugged
boy, and a good amateur wrestler,
but that red sweater looked mighty
lonely as the Cal section began to
get riled up.
If he sticks around, Wink may
he of some assistance to Clark
Shajughncssy bolstering up the
tackle positions next fall.
The cold dope on Davidson's ankle.
When Kenny left the floor just be
fore half time it looked as though
Evei'ett Dean might have something
to worry about. The ankle was hurt
last week, and reinjury might be
not so good.
But it turned out' to be nothing
important. Kenny had been playing
with the ankle taped, and when the
exertion caused it to swell some
what he had to go in and have it
retaped.
Kenny didn't suit up for the
U.S.F. game the following night,
and should be in top shape for the
U.S.C. series this week-end.
* * *
IN OUR estimation, the popular
slander that the Indian hoop
squad is weak in reserve strength
received something of a blow-up at
Kezar Auditorium Saturday.
U.S.F. may not have a really top
flight basketball team, but they have
got a gang of men who are sup
posed to know something about the
game. Add to this the fact that they
were playing on what amounts to
being their home court, and they
should be a fairly dangerous op
ponent.
So Everett Dean started his
second string against the Dons.
And that second string came
through with a 37-35 victory.
Three regulars saw action. Don
Williams, Fordy Anderson and Bill
Cowden entered the game in the
last minute and thirty seconds to
protect the two-point lead.
* * *
r J' , HIS doesn't exactly belong in this
column, but as both parties con
cerned jp'e at present active in
fports, we'll try and slip it by.
Anyway, our nomination for the
best-looking couple at the Sadie
Hawkins Hop Friday night goes to
Chuck Hutchison, soph tennis
flash, and Frank Hewitt, AII-U
135-pound champ for two years
running.

fore half time it looked as though
Evei'ett Dean might have something
to worry about. The ankle was hurt
last week, and reinjury might be
not so good.
But it turned out' to be nothing
important. Kenny had been playing
with the ankle taped, and when the
exertion caused it to swell some
what he had to go in and have it
retaped.
Kenny didn't suit up for the
U.S.F. game the following night,
and should be in top shape for the
U.S.C. series this week-end.

IN OUR estimation, the popular
slander that the Indian hoop
squad is weak in reserve strength
received something of a blow-up at
Kezar Auditorium Saturday.
U.S.F. may not have a really top
flight basketball team, but they have
got a gang of men who are sup
posed to know something about the
game. Add to this the fact that they
were playing on what amounts to
being their home court, and they
should be a fairly dangerous op
ponent.
So Everett Dean started his
second string against the Dons.
And that second string came
through with a 37-35 victory.
Three regulars saw action. Don
Williams, Fordy Anderson and Bill
Cowden entered the game in the
last minute and thirty seconds to
protect the two-point lead.

Anyway, our nomination for the
best-looking couple at the Sadie
Hawkins Hop Friday night goes to
Chuck Hutchison, soph tennis

135-pound champ for two years
running.
A T THE basketball game Friday
night.
Wonder why Winkic Jones, wear
ing the armband of a B.A.C. cop,
was beefing with the Cal rooters
across the way before the game
started. Wink is a pretty rugged
boy, and a good amateur wrestler,
but that red sweater looked mighty
lonely as the Cal section began to
get riled up.
If he sticks around, Wink may
he of some assistance to Clark
Shajughncssy bolstering up the
tackle positions next fall.
The cold dope on Davidson's ankle.
