### 
Led by three members of Clark Shaughncssy's Rose Bowl football
team, Stanford's varsity rugby squad trounced a weak-looking Petaluma
Spartan outfit by a 17-0 count last Saturday afternoon.
Of the Indians' 17 tallies, 12 were made by former football players,
Kerman scoring six, while A1 Cole and Norm Standlee each

.made a try for a total of six more.
Kernian made his points on two
free kicks, while Cole's came as
the climax of a passing rush and a
sideline run. Standlee powered his
way over the line from about 15
yards out. A conversion by Carl
Gerlach and a try by A1 Wool fin
ished the scoring for the day.
The Indians showed a great deal
of improvement over their game of
last week, especially in the forward
wall, where the improvement was
particularly noticeable. The backs,
although handicapped by the loss of
first-stringers Pete Kmetovic and
Frankie Albert, managed to show up
well on their defensive work, but at
times their offensive tactics left
much to be desired.

Kerman scoring six, while A1 Cole and Norm Standlee each

.made a try for a total of six more.
Kernian made his points on two
free kicks, while Cole's came as
the climax of a passing rush and a
sideline run. Standlee powered his
way over the line from about 15
yards out. A conversion by Carl
Gerlach and a try by A1 Wool fin
ished the scoring for the day.
The Indians showed a great deal
of improvement over their game of
last week, especially in the forward
wall, where the improvement was
particularly noticeable. The backs,
although handicapped by the loss of
first-stringers Pete Kmetovic and
Frankie Albert, managed to show up
well on their defensive work, but at
times their offensive tactics left
much to be desired.
HERMAN KICKS
Although Stanford kept the ball
consistently within Petaluma terri
tory during the first half they were
unable to score except on the two
free kicks by Kerman and the half
ended with the board reading 6-0 in
favor of the Cards. Highlight of the
period was a brilliant 50-yard run
by A1 Wool.
Starting slowly in the second half,
the Indians awoke with a bang, a
good passing rush developed, and A1
Cole stepped his way along the side
lines for a try. Gerlach converted
from a difficult angle to raise the
ante to 11-0.
CHIEF TALLIES
Shortly afterwards a dribbling
rush started, culminating when
Standlee took the ball th last 15
yards with about four men hanging
onto him. In the closing minutes of
the game A1 Wool made the final try
and closed the scorebook for the
afternoon.
The Stanford frosh defeated the
Reserves, 3-0, in the pi'climinary to
the varsity tilt.
Led by three members of Clark Shaughncssy's Rose Bowl football
team, Stanford's varsity rugby squad trounced a weak-looking Petaluma
Spartan outfit by a 17-0 count last Saturday afternoon.
Of the Indians' 17 tallies, 12 were made by former football players,
Kerman scoring six, while A1 Cole and Norm Standlee each

.made a try for a total of six more.
