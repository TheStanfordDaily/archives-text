# Frosh Quint Works Overtime To Top California Cubs, 37-34
## 
### 
Stanford's yearling cagemen work
ed overtime Friday night in the
Pavilion to stop a stubborn Califor
nia frosh, 37-34, in the first of their
three-game series.
The lead see-sawed back and
forth in the first half, and not once
was there more than a four-point
?ap between the two quintets.
Stanford's man-to-man defense ap
peared strong at the start, but the
Cubs' Bob Dabble, seemingly pos
sessed of dead-eye accuracy, brought
the Redshirt guards out into the
back court with his uncanny shots
from anywhere outside the keyhole.
The speedy California forward hit
the hoop for 10 points to take second
in the high-scoring department to
the Cardinals' Jim Pollard, who
Withered a total of 13. The score was
t : ied at lfi-16 at the half .
PAPOOSES FORGE AHEAD
With about a minute and a half
Lo go, "cool and collected" Dick West
dropped in a one-handed push shot
from the slot to put the Card babes
| in front, 20-27. Captain Jim Pollard
1 threw on the stall signal, and while
, (he clock ran around the '44 boys
I played hot potato, but not quite long
enough.
Lanky Eob Wriesner was close in
and tried a shot with but seven sec
onds remaining. Cal's substitute
guard, Stan Troedson, grabbed the
leather off the backboard and went
all the way down, shooting from
about 20 feet out. The ball dropped
through the cords, and a moment
later as the gun barked, the score
was deadlocked at 29-29.
Overtime was a different story.
I An inspired Red and White team
came back and played top-notch
basketball, stymying Cal at every
point and holding Coach Bob Her
wig's club to a mere five tallies in
the five-minute added session.
DABBLE HOT
After the amazing Dabble had
opened the extra period with a field
goal, Pollard calmly cashed in a
charity toss, and Bodo Middleton
took a pass from Wreisner and
swished the net for two points to
put Stanford ahead, 32-31.

Cal's rangy Jack Rocker tied it up I
again on a free throw, but Pollard
countered with a center-in pass
play from Wreisner and the Cards
forged ahead, 34-32. Wreisner per
formed a perfectly executed pivot
play and made the try good to give
his mates a four-point advantage.
Pollard got a great hand from the
assembled mob as he went out on
four personals, Fred Oliver taking
over at his forward spot. With some
70 or 80 seconds left the Reds pulled
a successful stall, losing the ball
only once to Tommy Carlson, who
tallied a field goal.

Lloyd Brown, former big league
southpaw, 2 and 1, for the sixth an
nual baseball players' golf cham
pionship.
Stanford's yearling cagemen work
ed overtime Friday night in the
Pavilion to stop a stubborn Califor
nia frosh, 37-34, in the first of their
three-game series.
The lead see-sawed back and
forth in the first half, and not once
was there more than a four-point
?ap between the two quintets.
Stanford's man-to-man defense ap
peared strong at the start, but the
Cubs' Bob Dabble, seemingly pos
sessed of dead-eye accuracy, brought
the Redshirt guards out into the
back court with his uncanny shots
from anywhere outside the keyhole.
The speedy California forward hit
the hoop for 10 points to take second
in the high-scoring department to
the Cardinals' Jim Pollard, who
Withered a total of 13. The score was
t : ied at lfi-16 at the half .

I played hot potato, but not quite long
enough.
Lanky Eob Wriesner was close in
and tried a shot with but seven sec
onds remaining. Cal's substitute
guard, Stan Troedson, grabbed the
leather off the backboard and went
all the way down, shooting from
about 20 feet out. The ball dropped
through the cords, and a moment
later as the gun barked, the score
was deadlocked at 29-29.
Overtime was a different story.
I An inspired Red and White team
came back and played top-notch
basketball, stymying Cal at every
point and holding Coach Bob Her

the five-minute added session.
DABBLE HOT
After the amazing Dabble had
opened the extra period with a field
goal, Pollard calmly cashed in a
charity toss, and Bodo Middleton
took a pass from Wreisner and
swished the net for two points to
put Stanford ahead, 32-31.
