FACULTY and student opinions on the war
are remarkably similar. According to Pi Sig
ma Alpha's poll of Stanford professors, faculty
minds have reacted in much the same way to
national foreign policy as have those of their
students, as revealed several weeks ago in a
Daily cross-sectional sampling.
In general, students seem to favor the Lend-
Lease Bill a little more strongly than faculty
members. Undergraduates, too, are slightly
more affirmative in their belief that the present
policy of all-aid-short-of-war will probably lead
to U.S. armed participation.
This, in itself, reveals a strange inconsistency
on the surface. Both professors and students
favor aid to England; neither group wishes to
enter the war in a direct way; and yet both feel
that our current policies are leading us into the
struggle.
This line of reasoning has appeared in each
of the polls. And, in general, it seems to reflect
an attitude that the entire nation senses. Emo
tionally and practically we want to help Eng
land. At the same time we're reasonably sure
that it's leading us toward war. That accounts
for the majority vote against sending our ships
to convoy British merchant vessels or to trans
port war materials. These are simply proce
dures that are more dangerous for our "neu
trality." If these ships are torpedoed, we are all
sure that America will be drawn into the con
flict. In short, convoying British ships and
using the American merchant marine to carry
supplies is, in the opinion of most of us, merely
"asking for it." We can still remember 1917.
There's a top-spin of fatality and pessimism
on this rolling ball of public opinion, too. No
matter how much we may feel that our govern
ment's undertakings are leading us toward war,
we also experience a sense of futility in trying
to avert entrance. This may stem from the fact
that many Stanfordites—and many Americans
—believe that, in the long run, England will
be defeated and America will be left the task
of cleaning up Europe, or living in a world
dominated largely by Naziism. Those who
think in this vein are backing England now, as
a temporary practical policy, just as one would
finger an amulet, with a prayer on his lips.
Actually, then, the fact that replies to Pi
Sigma Alpha and the Daily poll do not show
what statisticians would call a lovely consist
ency is not really a startling result. War or
peace are comparative matters and the method
of their attainment is not as clear as a mathe
matical equation.
Winston Churchill came nearest the truth,
perhaps, when he declared yesterday that this
is a war of machines, while World War I was
one of men. "Give us the tools and we shall
fight it," he said. America has already pledged
herself to that end.
