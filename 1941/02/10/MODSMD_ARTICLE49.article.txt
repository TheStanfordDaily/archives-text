# Vox Populi

THE percentage of people who take the
trouble to vote in the winter elections is
usually well below the 50-mark. But this time
Ex Committee and Election Chairman Betty
Moses have instituted a few new wrinkles de
signed to prop that total into some sort of a
respectable figure.
The fact that less than half the student body
will be selecting about ten important A.S.S.U.
officials is nothing for a student democracy to
boast about. However, with polls open for a
longer time, especially with the Law Steps poll
handling all "windup" balloters until 4:30, the
turnout should increase somewhat.
It won't be sensationally big, probably, but
it should indicate that at least a slightly larger
crowd will pick the winners.

If only those people who have screamed at
an unpopular B.A.C. ruling will take the trouble
to vote for B.A.C. member . . .
If only those of us who've complained at Ex
com for piddling with useless details and over
looking some major student affair will vote for
the three Ex Committee posts . . .
If only those of us who've booed the yell
leader for his choice of yells or his inept re
marks will stop at the polls tomorrow to choose
next year's king . . .
If only those of us who've argued with Men's
Council about that parking tag we picked up
while we "stopped for a minute in front of the
Ad Building" will take the time to cast a bal
lot .. .
Then we'll have a democratic election and
a representative student government.
