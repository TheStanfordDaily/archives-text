EDITORIAL STAFF will ease regular meeting
day forward to Monday instead of Tuesday,
slip into the Shack about 1:15 with plenty of
handkerchiefs and black crepe to mourn the
death of Volume 98.
Minus the two associates, who should be well
on their convivial way to San Francisco, Edit
Board will convene at one o'clock to bank
flowers around the coffin and offer up slight
prayerful hymns. Afternoon Club will be con
ducted in hushed silence and mourners will
group themselves around the departed in last
tribute. Edit Board will foot the bill.
