### BUD AMES 
SILENT WINGS OF INVASION
morning. A bunch of fraternity men, some
in pajamas, two or three wrapped in towels on
their way to the shower—all pausing, listening silent
to the radio.
Winston Churchill was speaking. And everyone of
those men wanted to hear what he had to say.
As a matter of fact, the Prime Minister didn't say
a great deal that could be termed of world import.
There were few promises— except of "an ultimate vic
tory." Speaking in a Boake Carterish voice, Churchill
summarized the encouraging events of the past two
months, warned Bulgaria not to make the mistake of
jumping in with Germany as they did in the last
war, and called upon the British people for increased
vigilance in the face of increasing invasion threats.
* * * *
W/HAT sort of invasions did he mention? He warned
against invasion by gas, by parachute, by gliders.
By gliders. That strikes a new note, a note which
bears careful consideration. You've undoubtedly been
thinking a great deal about invasion these last few
months. And without assuming too much, it is fairly
safe to assume that you thought of that invasion of
Britain in terms of boats, hundreds of them, and planes,
hundreds of them, ferrying German troops across the
Channel.
But how about this glider angle?
Oh, no, it's not a silly as it sounds. In fact, it's
highly probable and possible.
Last year we interviewed a little Hungarian who
had just come from a little town near the Austrian
border. This man, after graduation from the Zurich
Institute of Technology in Switzerland, went to Ger
many and took up gliding.
He there became the first Hungarian ever to receive
a German class A gliding license.
* * * *
our conversations, this Hungarian spoke
often of the extensive gliding training that has
been going on in Germany for the many past years.
Thousands of Germans ai'e learning to soar, he in
forms us. There is no fuel waste, and at the same
time, the students learn all the necessary fundamentals
for flying a motor driven plane.
The Germans never let outsiders know much about
what is going on inside Germany. But you can bet
your last $50 bill that German potentates aren't for
getting this inexpensive, efficient, and silent means of
transporting troops to England.
On the warm currents riding over England's shores,
thousands of gliders, carrying a man and a machine
gun, or small bombs, or radio equipment, could soar
silently, silently over the British cities. There would
be no air warning. Nothing but silence.
And then, at the appointed minute, down they
would come, thousands of them.
So take the tip of the little Hungarian Stanford stu
dent who has seen what is actually happening. And
when and if the invasion comes, look for those gliders.
Silent wings of invasion.

been going on in Germany for the many past years.
Thousands of Germans ai'e learning to soar, he in
forms us. There is no fuel waste, and at the same
time, the students learn all the necessary fundamentals
for flying a motor driven plane.
The Germans never let outsiders know much about
what is going on inside Germany. But you can bet
your last $50 bill that German potentates aren't for
getting this inexpensive, efficient, and silent means of
transporting troops to England.
On the warm currents riding over England's shores,
thousands of gliders, carrying a man and a machine
gun, or small bombs, or radio equipment, could soar
silently, silently over the British cities. There would
be no air warning. Nothing but silence.
And then, at the appointed minute, down they
would come, thousands of them.
So take the tip of the little Hungarian Stanford stu
dent who has seen what is actually happening. And
when and if the invasion comes, look for those gliders.
Silent wings of invasion.
SILENT WINGS OF INVASION
morning. A bunch of fraternity men, some
in pajamas, two or three wrapped in towels on
their way to the shower—all pausing, listening silent
to the radio.
Winston Churchill was speaking. And everyone of
those men wanted to hear what he had to say.
As a matter of fact, the Prime Minister didn't say
a great deal that could be termed of world import.
There were few promises— except of "an ultimate vic
tory." Speaking in a Boake Carterish voice, Churchill
summarized the encouraging events of the past two
months, warned Bulgaria not to make the mistake of
jumping in with Germany as they did in the last
war, and called upon the British people for increased
vigilance in the face of increasing invasion threats.

W/HAT sort of invasions did he mention? He warned
against invasion by gas, by parachute, by gliders.
By gliders. That strikes a new note, a note which
bears careful consideration. You've undoubtedly been
thinking a great deal about invasion these last few
months. And without assuming too much, it is fairly
safe to assume that you thought of that invasion of
Britain in terms of boats, hundreds of them, and planes,
hundreds of them, ferrying German troops across the
Channel.
But how about this glider angle?
Oh, no, it's not a silly as it sounds. In fact, it's
highly probable and possible.
Last year we interviewed a little Hungarian who
had just come from a little town near the Austrian
border. This man, after graduation from the Zurich
Institute of Technology in Switzerland, went to Ger
many and took up gliding.
He there became the first Hungarian ever to receive
a German class A gliding license.
