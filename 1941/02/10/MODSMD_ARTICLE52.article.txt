# CAMPUS OPINION
## . . . AT ONCE 
### 
r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
The Daily is a very fine paper.
However, Daily dear, we feel that there are a few
matters that should be brought to your attention.
Namely, viz., and to wit: Stanford women wear bobby
socks on the Quad; Stanford students smoke on the
Quad; the rushing system is based on false prin
ciples; the campus roads should be improved; the Cel
lar coffee is really very poor; the B.A.C. is a czar;
Stanford students pay no attention to what goes on
in the outside world; very few Stanford men have
draft registration cards; nobody ever picks up any
body when he drives to Paly; or back; social sciences
120 is restricted to seniors, and juniors who are
engaged.
Please attend to these matters at once.
Thank you.
Tevis Ferguson and Charles Jameson
