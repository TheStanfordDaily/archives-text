THE EDITOR, SIR:
Again it seems necessary to bring up that old
gripe of getting rides to and from Palo Alto. I have
nothing at all against the men students; whether they
are driving '24 Dodged or '41 Cadillacs, they invariably
have the courtesy to pick up the poor pedestrian or at
least look sympathetic.
The object of this criticism are the women that are
more than happy to be asked out on a date, ride to
and from the City and then the next day, when they
happen to be fortunate enough to be in their own car
or one of their friends', just breeze by, leaving their
one-time dates standing on the street corner for
lornly looking in the direction of the campus. (Their
special delight is to cruise around and around the
hitch-hiker, usually when it is raining.)
As usual, this opinion will do no good, but at any
rate, it will give the women an idea of how the males
around here feel about the whole thing.
