# Quarantine Off For Gamma Phi
## Polio Spread Danger Subsides on Campus 
### 
Quarantine of the Gamma Phi
Beta house for infantile paralysis is
over this morning, according to an
announcement from Dr. Helen B.
Pryor, medical adviser to women.
The restriction was officially
placed on the house early Friday
by the Stale Doard of Health as a
pi'ecaution against the remote possi
bility of infection. The two women
students were rembved from the
house on Januafy 28 and 29 re
spectfully. At the time neither of
the girls realized the potential grav
ity of their condition, Dr. Pryor
said.
The more serious case was first
treated at the Palo Alto Hospital
as a strep throat. When, on last
Monday, the girl did not respond
to treatment for the throat ailment,
the polio condition was apprehended.
Reckoning from Jan. 29, when the
second case broke out, the incuba
tion period is up today and Dr.
Pryor announced last night that she
believed Ihe campus was "safely
through it."
"It is not an epidemic now. The
disease is really seasonal in epi
demic form, coming then in late
summer. When it occurs like this,
it is what is called 'sporadic'."
Asked if the general student body
should be advised of necessary pre
cautions, Dr. Pryor stated that there
was no call for any to be taken now
that the incubation period is over.
