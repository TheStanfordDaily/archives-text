BRANDT, Stanford's inter
nationally-famed expert in the
Food Research Institute, indicated
Saturday in the panel discussion on
"Where does America Go from
Here?" that Germany's only imme
diate point of vulnerability in re
gard to foods or resources is her oil
supply.
Mr. Brandt asserted Germany had
the necessary military equipment
"to shoot the works" in an attack
on Britain this spring. The food
supply of Europe, he said, was ade
quate at least for this winter, al
though he predicted widespread
malnutrition.
Oil ,Mr. Brandt declared, was the
one commodity Germany was hav
ing trouble in procuring, although
a deficiency did not exist now be
cause of the huge stores accumu
lated during seven years of "prep
aration" prior to the outbreak of
the war.
Yesterday, Britain broke off diplo
matic relations with Rumania.
On the surface the news does not
sound astounding, for it has been
known for some time that Nazi
troops have occupied the country—
perhaps preparatory to jumping off
on a new drive deeper into the
Balkans.
But Britain's move may be a step
in the direction of a declaration of
war against Rumania and this could
be of the utmost importance. Ru
mania is Germany's chief source of
oil.
According to the official state
ment released in London, the Nazis
are using Rumanian territory "with
out one word of dissent from the
Rumanian government" as a "mili
tary base in furtherance of plans
for prosecuting the war."
Britain, it appears, needs little
educational excuse to declare war
against Rumania under such cir
cumstances.

| RUMANIA on March 23, 1939,
signed a trade agreement with
Germany which provided among
other things for German rearma
ment of Rumania and for Germany
to supervise development of re
sources including oil within Ru
mania.
In other words, Rumanian econ
omy even before actual Nazi troops
occupied the country was geared
by Germans for the German war
machine.
Britain, it is supposed, would like
the opportunity to cut off this sup
ply of oil from the Reich. With air
bases in Greece, Britain might
carry out successfully such an oper
ation. The same operation might
have been next to impossible before
Greek bases were available to the
British.
Prime Minister Winston Church
ill in his speech two days ago
warned that German advance units
were pouring into Bulgaria. He
called them the "tentacles" of the
Nazi war machine.
Yesterday, information came from
several sources in Europe that
"thousands of German troops" in
civilian clothes were entering Bul
garia to make way for an outright
invasion of the country. According
to these reports, the German ad
vanced guard resembled the ad
vanced "tourist" units dispatched to
Norway and the Lowlands before
actual attack.

r | I HE situation in France may have
taken a peculiar turn. It is ru
mored that Hitler has discontinued
his support of Laval and "will at
tempt to find "another solution." At
any rate, it appears Marshal Petain
has won at least a temporary vic
tory with the installation of Admiral
Darlan in the Cabinet—in the post
of foreign minister which Laval de
manded be given him.
But the rumor has its ominous in
terpretations, too. When Hitler turns
to "another solution," it may well be
occupation of what remains of Free
France.
