# Light Satire Opens Here Wednesday
## Politics Complicate Story in Behrman's 'Rain from Heaven' 
### 
A newspaper story about a Ger
man-Jewish refugee first gave Sam
uel Behrman the idea for his play
"Hiain from Heaven," which will be
Riven in tlie Little Theater for four
nights starting Wednesday.
The story concerns an English
lady who has a habit of collecting
friends and trying to aid worthy
causes, her pity extending especially
to refugees from totalitarian states.
When the play opens there are
three refugees staying with Lady
Wingate. One is a German-Jewish
music critic, Hugo Willens, who has
b en banned from Germany but
v. ho feels it is better to fight than
b ■ resigned to his fate.
€13A KACTER CONTRAST
Other refugees are Jurin, a Rus
sian who is resigned to being a Jew,
a.id Sasha, another Russian who
ti ics to hide that he is Jewish.
Also staying with Lady Wingate at
the time are some American
friends; Rand Eldridge, who is in
love with the British noblewoman;
Rand's brother, Hobart; an Ameri
can newspaperman who is very
much interested in youth movements.
Hobart's wife, Phoebe, has once
had an affair with Willens and she
tells Rand that Willens and Lady
Wingate are having an affair to
complicate the situation.
MORE COMPLICATIONS
Sasha is in love with Joan, Ho
bart's daughter, who is there with
her parents; and last of the house
hold is Wyatt, an American Rhodes
Scholar who is laughingly referred
to as "the American refugee."
The play is written around con
temporary affairs but has Behrman's
touch of light comedy which is both
entertaining and serious. The var
ious love affairs and their result,
along with the question of whether
Hobart's ventures in youth move
ments will succeed, go to make up
the plot.
Tickets for the show may be re
served by calling at the box office or

Other refugees are Jurin, a Rus
sian who is resigned to being a Jew,
a.id Sasha, another Russian who
ti ics to hide that he is Jewish.
Also staying with Lady Wingate at
the time are some American
friends; Rand Eldridge, who is in
love with the British noblewoman;
Rand's brother, Hobart; an Ameri
can newspaperman who is very
much interested in youth movements.
Hobart's wife, Phoebe, has once
had an affair with Willens and she
tells Rand that Willens and Lady
Wingate are having an affair to
complicate the situation.
MORE COMPLICATIONS
Sasha is in love with Joan, Ho
bart's daughter, who is there with
her parents; and last of the house
hold is Wyatt, an American Rhodes
Scholar who is laughingly referred
to as "the American refugee."
The play is written around con
temporary affairs but has Behrman's
touch of light comedy which is both
entertaining and serious. The var
ious love affairs and their result,
along with the question of whether
Hobart's ventures in youth move
ments will succeed, go to make up
the plot.
Tickets for the show may be re
served by calling at the box office or
by calling Mr. Barker at P.A. 22041.
A newspaper story about a Ger

"Hiain from Heaven," which will be
Riven in tlie Little Theater for four

The story concerns an English

friends and trying to aid worthy
causes, her pity extending especially

When the play opens there are
three refugees staying with Lady
Wingate. One is a German-Jewish
music critic, Hugo Willens, who has
