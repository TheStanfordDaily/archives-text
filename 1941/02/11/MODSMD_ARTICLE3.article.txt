# British Stop Rumanian Relations
## English Call Country 'Nazi Military Base,' Increase War Threat 
### 
LONDON, Feb. 10 (UP).—Great
Britain Monday broke oIT diplomatic
relations with Rumania because the
Balkan nation had become "a Ger
man military base" and brought
nearer the threat of a British aerial
attack on the vital Rumanian oil
fields, now guarded by German
troops.
Bombardment of the oil fields
which supplying Germany's war
machine with fuel undoubtedly
would be withheld, however, until
a declaration of war against the
strife-torn nation. Britain fears
Adolf Hitler soon may strike from
Rumania across Bulgaria toward
Turkey and the Dardanelles.
The stage was set for an eventual
declaration of war—should the more
than 200,000 German troops now in
Rumania strike deeper into the
Balkans—when British Minister Sir
Reginald Hoare in Bucharest handed
a note to Premier General lon An
tonescu breaking off relations.
Balkan diplomats said that they
feared war might be close at hand
in the Balkans, involving not only
Rumania but Bulgaria as well.
With the German army en
trenched throughout Rumania, re
ports reached London of the es
tablishment of a big Nazi military
base in Bulgarian Dobrudja near
Rumania's southern border.
Reports that Russia has given Bul
garia a "last chance" to sign a mili
tary alliance were treated skeptically
by diplomats who said such a Soviet
move at this moment might easily
be construed in Berlin as a hostile
act. The Secretary General of the
Russian Foreign Office, A. M. Sobo
leff, is reported to have arrived in
Sofia, however.
