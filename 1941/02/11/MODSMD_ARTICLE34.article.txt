aggregation (hat can Jay claim
to having one of the strongest
boxing teams on the Pacific Coast, if
not in the country, will furnish the
opposition for Coach Clayton Frye's
mittmen Friday night.
The Cal Aggies recently gave
warning (hat they will he just as
lough as ever in the ring this year,
when (hey copped a s'a to 2\■>
meet from Oregon State.
For a relatively small school the
Aggies invariably come up with an
unusually large and talented group
of boxers.
Most publicized battler on the
Aggie squad is Elton Tobiassen,
who last year copped the Pacific
Coast 145-pound crown. Frankie
Hewitt, if he is able to round into
shape, will oppose Tobiassen and
should give him a tough bout.
Hewitt missed practice all last
week because of a had cold, hut
if he can get in some kind of con
dition between now and Friday he
will have a good chance to upset
the Aggie pride.
The Davis squad will furnish
Johnny Ward with some opposition
in the heavyweight class in the per
son of one Ralph Colin. Colin has
one kayo win on his record already
this season over Ken Pruitt of
O.S.C.

good for a laugh, the
Examiner.
Rapidly becoming famous in the
fourth estate is this San Francisco
paper's aptitude for seeing the funny
side of things. Yesterday morning,
in case you missed it, it was the
sports page streamer that carried
the chuckle.
STANFORD SIGNS DON GAME
—MALLEY RESIGNS
Which is one of the best tributes
yet to Clark Shaughnessy and his
T formation outfit.

Jy/JALLEY'S resignation and the
possibility of Buck Shaw's go
ing back to Notre Dame may bring
a couple of new personalities into
bay area coaching circles.
We won't believe that Buck Shaw
yarn until we see it confirmed in
print, however. Buck is so well
taken care of in regard to athletes,
etc., at Santa Clara that he would be
foolish to try and step into Layden's
shoes unless offered a good slice of
the output of the United States
mint.
Advice ot U.S.F. from this col
umn is to grab Mr. Slip Madigan
away from the Albany boss track.
The way things seem to be going
at the cross-the-bay circuit. Slip
should be just about ready to get
out of that whacky racket and
back into something sane and
peaceful like football.
If given anything like a free hand,
Madigan would have the Dons going
places in the higher gridiron circles
in practically no time. Give him a
good line coach, say Tiny Thornhill,
and U.S.F. would have one of the
best drawing teams on the Coast
and elsewhere.

TUST one question before closing
•" up for the day. Will someone
kindly explain why the bottom has
dropped out of golf scores? We can
remember way back to the days
when a 70 was a fairly respectable
score. Yet this winter you can
hardly pick up a paper without
reading about some guy tieing the
P.G.A. competitive 18-hole record
with a 62. Are the courses easier,
the golfers better, or what?
