# Farm Hoopsters Point to S.C. Series to Cinch P.C.C. Crown
## 
### 
Despite the fact that they ; way out in front with a bendlock on
the leadership of the Coast ( ■ erence Southern Division, Stanford's
hoopsters are doing anything Init !• fing these days.
In the final pair of games it • U.S.C. scries, coming up this week
end in Los Angeles, the Indians II be trying to come as close as nos-

sible to wrapping up the Soul he: <
Division crown for themselves, b
cause a twin win over the Trojans
would mean that the Indians would
only have to cop one game from Cal
in order to take the championship.
The results of their two games
with U.C.L.A. a week from this Fri
day and Saturday nights would have
no effect on the outcome of Stan
ford's position in the final confer
ence standings.
STILL NO CINCII
However, it is going to be no easy
task for the Indians to roll through
the second half of this conference
loop. For, while the first half was a
drawn-out affair with a great many
open dates for practice games tossed
in, the second half finds three
straight week-ends of concent!.ited
league play.
After this week-end's Trojan
clashes the Cards have to fact the
surprising Bruins in two games, and
then on Feb. 28 and March 1, Stan
ford closes its regular basketball
schedule with a pair of contests with"
Cal, Friday night's game to be
played at Berkeley and Saturday
night's clash here.
LIKELY TO TIRE
This is going to make it tough go
ing for Coach Everett Dean's cagers.
who have tendency to tire badly in
the second game of a two-night
stand, although this tendency is not
as pronounced this season as it was
a year ago. However, the Indians
will havo a little relief from the
usual pressure, for by winning only
one game 4rom each Troy, Uch.
and Cal, the Indians v/ill still haw
at least a lie for the top spot in th<
Southern Division clinched.
At that, it would only be a tie i
if the Bears can win two games from !
each U.S.C. and U.C.L.A.
The ankle injury sustained by
Co-captain Kenny Davidson in the
Ucla series bothered him just .1
little against Cal Friday night, but
with the rest he has had over th>
week-end, the tricky Stanford guar*
should be able to hit it up in prac
tice this week.
