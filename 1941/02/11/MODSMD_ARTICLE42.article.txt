# Card-All Star Battle Slated
## 
### 
Yesterday's leaden skies and inter
mittent showers didn't help, but if
the sun shines Stanford's varsity
nine will engage Gaddini's All-Stars
on the Sunken Diamond tomorrow
afternoon at 3:15.
Rain and a soggy field canceled the
Cards' game with the Stars last
week after two innings, with the
northerners leading 1-0. Heading
Gaddini's aggregation of professional
and semi-pro ball players is Ted
Jennings, third baseman of the San
Francisco Seals.
WOLF INJURED
Phil Wolf, one of Coach Harry
Wolter's starting pitchers, injured his
hands in a glass door Saturday and
will probably be lost to the squad
for almost a month. Two stitches
had to be taken, and Wolf won't
even be able to wave at anybody
for a while. But in about three weeks
he'll get a chance to start working
the wing back in shape for the Reds'
initial league encounter with Santa
Clara on March 1.
During the interim Wolter has
three other moundsmen who are
x'eady, willing and able — namely,
Russ Smith, "Cootie" Thompson, and
Claude Purkitt.
MILLION DOLLAR INFIELD
Around the infield most spots are
two deep, and as the practice season
wears on, Wolters may develop a
million dollar combination.
At first base Hal Costello and Ray
Hammett are still battling it out,
while on the keystone Harry Par
sons and Tommy Howard are vying
for the starting berth. Monty Pfyl
has shortstop pretty well cinched,
and Elton Boone seems to have con
trol of third base.
