hard on the heels of Marshal Ro
dolfo Graziani's fleeing, shattered
army, was believed to be well past

moving across Tripolitanian soil, and
there were increasing indications
that General Sir Archibald Wavell
might push toward Tripoli, 425 miles
away, without, a paus.e

to be smashing hard at Tripoli,
perhaps in preparation for a land
drive. Planes of the British Medi

ting the big seaplane station there
and setting fire to an airdrome
hangar.

CAIRO, Feb. 10 (UP).—British
mechanized forces, biting ofT the
entire northern triangle of Italian
Eritrea, have reached the Red Sea
and captured the town of Mersa
Taclai while RAF bombers laid
siege to the Eritrean capital of As
mara, it was stated officially* Mon
day.
On the North African battlefront
the victorious Army of the Nile is
"clearing areas" westward to cap
tured El Agheila, a third of the way
from fallen Benghazi to the great
Italian base of Tripoli.
The British spearhead of tanks,
hard on the heels of Marshal Ro
dolfo Graziani's fleeing, shattered
army, was believed to be well past
El Agheila on the Gulf of Sidra,
moving across Tripolitanian soil, and
there were increasing indications
that General Sir Archibald Wavell
might push toward Tripoli, 425 miles
away, without, a paus.e
British bombers were revealed
to be smashing hard at Tripoli,
perhaps in preparation for a land
drive. Planes of the British Medi
terranean Fleet's air arm "suc
cessfully raided" Tripoli on Satur
day night and early Sunday, hit
ting the big seaplane station there
and setting fire to an airdrome
hangar.
Monday's high command commu
nique reported the capture of Karora
on the Eritrean-Sudan border about
25 miles from the Red Sea as well
as Mersa Taclai.
Mersa Taclai placed Britain's
forces on the Red Sea coast, north of
vital Massawa, for the first time.
Another British column which has
driven 150 miles into Eritrea from
the west, capturing Agordat and
Barentu with the eventual aim of
joining the northern force, continued
to exert "pressure on enemy posi
tions" around the railroad town of
Keren, 35 miles norwthest of As
mara.
