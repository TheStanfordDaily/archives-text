IT seems too simple—this preferential method
of voting. You just list the men or women
you prefer for the office, one, two, three, like
that.
And so the politicians for years have been
trying to complicate matters by urging you and
me to pick Glutz for number one, and then the
least likely to win for number two. "You don't
want to harm our man's chances by picking
this strong guy second," the ward-heelers say.
All this admonition about splitting the party
is so much political eye-wash. It just isn't pos
sible with a preferential ballot.
The one important thing to remember when
you go to the polls today is this:
Your second choices will not even be con
sidered until your first choice is definitely
defeated.
And so, just to make it very graphic, The
Daily will present a little practical example of
Stanford's election system in operation.
For our mock election, let's assume that Jones
and Wilson of the Halls will oppose Allen and
Cummings of the Row. When the votes are
counted, Jones has 200 votes, Wilson has 400,
Allen has 500, and Cummings 100.
This means a total of 1,200 votes, but no one
has a majority. Then the preferential mecha
nism goes to work. Cummings, who is low
man, is eliminated and his seconds are counted.
Fifty of these go to Allen, giving him 550. Wil
son got 25, for 425; Jones got 25 for a total of
225. Still no majority is apparent.
So Jones, the low man, is dropped and his sec
onds are tallied. His entire second vote may go
to Wilson, which puts the other Hall man ahead
with 625 and the election is in the bag.
Allen, who led the race for two rounds, was
aced out at the last because his party failed to
back him on seconds and the Halls failed to
switch any seconds to his side.
Our mock ballot ends, and those who've taken
the trouble to follow through a rather unintel
ligible maze of figures can see the result—
second choices are not counted until the first
choice candidate is definitely finished.
This election method has proved widely suc
cessful because, quite obviously, it allows the
individual voter to choose the men he thinks
most suited for the task, in the order of their
abilities. If he wishes to vote a "straight party
ticket," being perhaps unfamiliar with each can
didate, he is still permitted to do so. The prefer
ential ballot does not break up party lines, if
the voter wishes them to exist.
At the same time, this system allows you and
me to pick the men we want. If our boy Glutz
is defeated, our next choice has the benefit of
our support. No matter whether he be a Hall
or a Row candidate, if we think him capable,
he should receive our second-choice support.
And he will—but only after Glutz is polished
off.
Stanford's preferential system can tick along
with great efficiency. It can pick the best men
for the jobs, if the voters will just give it a
chance to work.

And so, just to make it very graphic, The
Daily will present a little practical example of
Stanford's election system in operation.
For our mock election, let's assume that Jones
and Wilson of the Halls will oppose Allen and
Cummings of the Row. When the votes are
counted, Jones has 200 votes, Wilson has 400,
Allen has 500, and Cummings 100.
This means a total of 1,200 votes, but no one
has a majority. Then the preferential mecha
nism goes to work. Cummings, who is low
man, is eliminated and his seconds are counted.
Fifty of these go to Allen, giving him 550. Wil
son got 25, for 425; Jones got 25 for a total of
225. Still no majority is apparent.
So Jones, the low man, is dropped and his sec
onds are tallied. His entire second vote may go
to Wilson, which puts the other Hall man ahead
with 625 and the election is in the bag.
Allen, who led the race for two rounds, was
aced out at the last because his party failed to
back him on seconds and the Halls failed to
switch any seconds to his side.
Our mock ballot ends, and those who've taken
the trouble to follow through a rather unintel
ligible maze of figures can see the result—
second choices are not counted until the first
choice candidate is definitely finished.
This election method has proved widely suc
cessful because, quite obviously, it allows the
individual voter to choose the men he thinks
most suited for the task, in the order of their
abilities. If he wishes to vote a "straight party
ticket," being perhaps unfamiliar with each can
didate, he is still permitted to do so. The prefer
ential ballot does not break up party lines, if
the voter wishes them to exist.
At the same time, this system allows you and
me to pick the men we want. If our boy Glutz
is defeated, our next choice has the benefit of
our support. No matter whether he be a Hall
or a Row candidate, if we think him capable,
he should receive our second-choice support.
And he will—but only after Glutz is polished
off.
Stanford's preferential system can tick along
with great efficiency. It can pick the best men
for the jobs, if the voters will just give it a
chance to work.
IT seems too simple—this preferential method
of voting. You just list the men or women
you prefer for the office, one, two, three, like
that.
And so the politicians for years have been
trying to complicate matters by urging you and
me to pick Glutz for number one, and then the
least likely to win for number two. "You don't
want to harm our man's chances by picking
this strong guy second," the ward-heelers say.
All this admonition about splitting the party
is so much political eye-wash. It just isn't pos
sible with a preferential ballot.
The one important thing to remember when
you go to the polls today is this:
Your second choices will not even be con
sidered until your first choice is definitely
defeated.
