# For the Laughs
## 
### 
DAILY people are a sentimental crowd.
Yesterday two men who've been hanging
around the Shack for three and a half years
walked out. One of them will return .today as
editor; the other will be through.
While there are certain advantages to spend
ing a carefree spring quarter, it will be tough
to fill in all those hours that have been spent
writing editorials and yarns, dummying, watch
ing the yellow paper roll out of the U.P. printer,
working with type and stories and people, or
just sitting around with a coke and a cigarette
for a little bull-slinging.
The one who doesn't come back today will
be the second best man on the staff—maybe
the best, actually. His loss will be felt by the
whole crew, but they're accustomed to such a
procedure. It has happened before, and it will
happen again.

The thing these men both realize is that The
Daily has to be worth while at the time, in it
self. If they've been figuring on the future,
they've lost a lot of the present. The work
they've done here is work for the hour alone—
for the kick it hands them day in and day out,
and for the laughs that come along. This is no
place to look too far into tomorrow—it has to be
good at the time to be worth the trouble.
If things have been satisfying, five days a
week or most of the five days, then the time
and effort have added up to a fair total. If the
future looks so rosy and the present so bad
that every day in the Shack is just a space of
time reaching toward an eventual goal, The
Daily has been a waste of time.
