ARE YOU MEN VIRILE?
W» A * is the Stanford man coming to? Worse yet,
what is the Stanford committeeman coming to?
Has he lost his fire, his flame, that old pepper? Is
he fizzling out?
Little articles turning up at the A.S.S.U. office
seem to indicate that he is. And it's a shame, too.
Back in the good old days you used to read reams
and reams of material extolling the merits of the
Stanford man in the rumble seat. A date with a Stan
ford man was the sure key to the happiest, hottest
evening of mixed entertainment.
And just a few years ago the Literary Digest Maga
zine carried a special poll article on what Stanford
students thought about kissing and necking.

Vf/TIAT did that poll show? Well, 81 per cent of the
students then said that they necked, 7 per cent
said no.
Forty-three per cent said they kissed on first dates.
But do you think a poll taken today would show
the same results. No. A bitter, broken no. Why?
Because the Stanford man has lost that certain some
thing, that touch, that feel of the situation which
used to give him that Melvyn Douglas-Clark Gable
appeal.
And the women know it. Yes, they are well, too
well aware of what has been going on in the male
ranks. And there is proof of that fact in that little
article in the A.S.S.U. office which we mentioned
before.
What is it?
It's the index to male virility on this campus.
What is it?
It's a hot water bottle.
* * * *

come, man, get a grip on yourself. Chin
up, stout heart, there'll always be an England,
and all that sort of stuff.
You see, fellows, a Stanford woman took that hot
water bottle with her on her Sadie Hawkins date last
Friday night. Now, haven't things come to a fine
state of affairs, haven't things taken a terrible turn,
when Stanford women have to take hot water bottles
along on dates?
What's the matter with you men? A hot water
bottle can't talk, can it? You can. A hot water bottle
can't dance, can it? You can. A hot water bottle can't
do hundreds of brilliant things you can do.
And yet, and yet, she still took along a hot water
bottle on her date. That's the sign. That's the straw
that broke the camel's back. The walls are crumbling.
The grains of sand have begun to flow.

as if that wasn't enough, that gal's date who
came to claim that hot water bottle turned out to
be a committeeman. A committeeman, mind you. The
men in whom we placed our trust. Our leaders, the
nucleus of our student body.
And she had to take along a hot water bottle.
Oh, the shame of it all. There's only one thing
left—the short way out. You never can face your
mother again. Never again can you look another hot
water bottle square in the face. The shame.

used to give him that Melvyn Douglas-Clark Gable
appeal.
And the women know it. Yes, they are well, too
well aware of what has been going on in the male
ranks. And there is proof of that fact in that little
article in the A.S.S.U. office which we mentioned
before.
What is it?
It's the index to male virility on this campus.
What is it?
It's a hot water bottle.
* * * *

come, man, get a grip on yourself. Chin
up, stout heart, there'll always be an England,
and all that sort of stuff.
You see, fellows, a Stanford woman took that hot
water bottle with her on her Sadie Hawkins date last
Friday night. Now, haven't things come to a fine
state of affairs, haven't things taken a terrible turn,
when Stanford women have to take hot water bottles
along on dates?
What's the matter with you men? A hot water
bottle can't talk, can it? You can. A hot water bottle
can't dance, can it? You can. A hot water bottle can't
do hundreds of brilliant things you can do.
And yet, and yet, she still took along a hot water
bottle on her date. That's the sign. That's the straw
that broke the camel's back. The walls are crumbling.
The grains of sand have begun to flow.

as if that wasn't enough, that gal's date who
came to claim that hot water bottle turned out to
be a committeeman. A committeeman, mind you. The
men in whom we placed our trust. Our leaders, the
nucleus of our student body.
And she had to take along a hot water bottle.
Oh, the shame of it all. There's only one thing
left—the short way out. You never can face your
mother again. Never again can you look another hot
water bottle square in the face. The shame.
ARE YOU MEN VIRILE?
W» A * is the Stanford man coming to? Worse yet,
what is the Stanford committeeman coming to?
Has he lost his fire, his flame, that old pepper? Is
he fizzling out?
Little articles turning up at the A.S.S.U. office
seem to indicate that he is. And it's a shame, too.
Back in the good old days you used to read reams
and reams of material extolling the merits of the
Stanford man in the rumble seat. A date with a Stan
ford man was the sure key to the happiest, hottest
evening of mixed entertainment.
And just a few years ago the Literary Digest Maga
zine carried a special poll article on what Stanford
students thought about kissing and necking.

Vf/TIAT did that poll show? Well, 81 per cent of the
students then said that they necked, 7 per cent
said no.
Forty-three per cent said they kissed on first dates.
But do you think a poll taken today would show
the same results. No. A bitter, broken no. Why?
Because the Stanford man has lost that certain some
thing, that touch, that feel of the situation which
used to give him that Melvyn Douglas-Clark Gable
appeal.
And the women know it. Yes, they are well, too
well aware of what has been going on in the male
ranks. And there is proof of that fact in that little
