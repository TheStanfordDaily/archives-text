r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
Contrary to the opinion expressed recently in
this paper concerning the mediocrity of one Mr.
Ames' column, I wish to state that there are many
of us who feel that The Daily should contain more
feature articles concerning student activity.
We are able to read the much censored war news
and various other affairs of national interest in any
of the City newspapers. Since Stanford is rather
spread out—especially the living organizations, articles
that featured more of the playful side of student life
would tend to help unify the student body in that we
could all enjoy them together.
Adding another such column to The Daily would
not detract at all from the standards of the paper as
many successful newspapers do contain such person
alized columns.
