EDITOR, SIR:
It would seem a serious reflection on the Univer
sity when the voice of religion is one crying out in
the wilderness on our campus. I have reference to
the sermon preached in our chapel this Sunday last
which was addressed for the most part to students. It
fell upon inappropriate ears for there were fewer than
one hundred Stanford students present, and they com
prised less than one-fourth of the congregation. In
view of the fact that ours is one of the most beautiful
chapels on the West Coast, and the service is less
than an hour long, it seems indeed strange that the
attendance at the basketball games outweighs that at
church by tenfold.
G. C. W.
