r IMIE EDITOR, SIR:
Bill 1776 (The Lcnd-Lease Bill) and other similar
bills have falsely been called Aid to Britain Bills.
They are not so. The Lend-Lease Bill and others will
only leave us with great problems and undoubtedly
very bitter. If we sell, lend, or lease war materials to
Britain we will have great financial worries, and if
we take colonial possessions for payment we will have
grave social and economic problems on hand.
If we sincerely believe in helping Britain, and I do,
we should send her arms as outright gifts or at cost,
regardless of consequences. If we extend such free
aid to Britain, I do not think that Germany will de
clare war on us, and unless we are greatly provoked,
I do not believe that we will declare war on Germany.
Our present form of "aid" to Britain is that Britain
will supply the blood, if we will supply the guns, if
Britain will supply the cash, If we don't want to sup
ply the blood, we should supply the cash as a gift.
Yours for less hypocrisy
Peter A. Low
