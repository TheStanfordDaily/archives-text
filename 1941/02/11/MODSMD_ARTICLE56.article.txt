# Rachmaninoff Program Hits Musical High
## 
### 
Sergei Rachmaninoff electrified a
San Francisco audience for the sec
ond time Friday afternoon when he
appeared as soloist for the first of
two paix-s of concerts with the San
Francisco Symphony Orchestra in
an all-Rachmaninoff program in the
War Memorial Opera House.
Rachmaninoff's music, often in
the Russian vein of Tschaikowsky,
and his great virtuosity combined to
produce one of the great concerts of
San Francisco's season.
PLAYS OWN NUMBER
The powerful, romantic second
symphony occupied the first half
of the program and the orchestra
under Pierre Monteux realized all
of the work's possibilities. It is one
of Rachmaninoff's greatest master
pieces and clearly dominated the
program.
The composer appeared as soloist
for the first time of the afternoon
playing his first piano concerto,
Rachmaninoff's Opus 1 written when
he was 17 years old. Although
completely revised in 1917, it can
in no way be compared to the sym
phony. But the composer's playing
gave it an enthusiastic performance.
RHAPSODY IS CLIMAX
The rhapsody on a theme of Paga
nini was Rachmaninoff's greatest
virtuoso triumph of the afternoon
and concluded the program. Com
posed on the tune of Paganini's
Caprice in A Minor for solo violin,
the work is in the form of 24 varia
tions on the original theme.
The program was repeated Satur
day night and Rachmaninoff will
appear again this week with the
symphony orchestra in a pair of
concerts devoted to works of Bee
thoven, Schumann, Wagner, and
the soloist's own third piano con
certo.â€”Adams
