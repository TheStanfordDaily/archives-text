# Stanford Women Forego Bridge to Knit for Britain
## 
### AMIE REICHERT 
President Wilbur has often said, "Some of the best Stanford men are
women.'
I To prove it, over 200 Stanford women are now foregoing bridge
games and movies to knit and sew for the British War Relief.
Room 21!), IJIO University Ave., is the headquarters of the Palo Alto

branch of the British War Relief,
Association of Northern California.
There each day, British sympathizers
who want to help may obtain wool
or material to make clothes for
British children and soldiers.
PALY WOMEN HELP
Palo Alto matrons devote one day
a week from 10 until 4 o'clock to
supervising the work. In addition to
giving out materials, they grate
fully receive donations in the form
of either money or old clothes.
> "We can use practically every
thing, and we are grateful for any
thing," said Mrs. Lily Freitus, who
was in charge of the office yesterday.
"The present need seems to be
greatest for evacuees, especially
children," she added.
Used clothing constitutes a great
and important part of the contribu
tions received. If the garments can
be mended they are fixed up by
workers and cleaned free of charge
by local cleaning establishments.
ARTICLES NEEDED
Every form of knitting and sewing
is needed and used by the associa
tion. Especially important are men's
pajamas, baby's layetes, children's
clothing, squares of cloth for quilts,
knitted squares for afghans and
stretcher covers, sweaters, socks,
mittens, and skirts.
Other items which are badly
needed are soap, flashlights, tooth
brushes, towels, sheets, and hospital
beds. The British Relief Association
of Northern California recently sent
300 hospital cots to the Middleton
Park Hospital in England. They are
being used there for wounded
R.A.F. pilots.
FARM WOMEN AID
Stanford girls, working either
through the campus Y.W.C.A. or
directly through the Palo Alto War
Relief Headquarters have been knit
ting and sewing and even making
helmets for soldiers.
All these articles are sent from
Palo Alto to the San Francisco
headquarters by car. Stanford girls
who own cars have also helped out
in the transportation problems.
The Palo Alto Relief has such a
large clientele that an elaborate
card file system is required to keep

track of all the workers. In addi
tion there are many people who
come in weekly with cash donations.
The Palo Alto branch was organ
ized in October, 1939, and in the last
year it has combined with the Allied
Relief Association, which was dis
solved.
Bazaars, raffles, and food sales are
also part of the association's activi
ties. And on Feb. 19 the Palo Alto
Community Players are presenting
"The Enchanted Cottage" for Brit
ish relief.
Stanford women who are anxious
to work should contact either Miss
Davidson of the F.W.C.A., Helen
Severance, or the British Relief of
fice in Palo Alto.
