### BOB LOW 
WILLKIE, less than 48
hours after his whirlwind trip
abroad, testified before the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee yes
terday on the British-aid bill.
The testimony in many ways was
not startling, for it has been known
that Willkie favors passage of the
bill. But as he spoke yesterday,
Willkie had in his mind a picture
of the England that is fighting this
war. No other person who has ap
peared before either the Senate
committee or the House committee
has had this experience recently.
While vigorously endorsing the
bill, Willkie made several sugges
tions worthy of consideration—es
pecially since it is almost a fore
gone conclusion that the bill will
pass.
The former Republican presiden
tial nominee emphasized the need of
amendments to limit any "unneces
sary authortiy" for the President,
but at the same time admitted the
proposed "extraordinary" powers
were intended to meet an "extra
ordinary situation."
He said many members of Con
gress who believe in the general
objectives of t!ie bill are "sincerely
disturbed" by its broad grant of
powers to the President. To eradi
cate this concern, he suggested the
Democratic majoi-ity "in the spirit
of candor and co-operation" try to
curtail to some extent the Presi
dent's tremendous sweep of power,
if this can be done without destroy
ing the objectives of the bill.
"It would be truly inspiring for
us and liberty loving people ev
erywhere if this bill could be
adopted with a non-partisan and
almost unanimous vote," he said.
He commented favorably on one
amendment which has been adopted
in the House version of the bill but
which has not gained widespread
attention. This amendment makes it
possible for Congress by a concur
rent resolution—by a majority vote
—to repeal the entire measure.
* * *
A s he read from his prepared state
ment, Willkie touched upon al
most every aspect of the bill.
"No man can guarantee to you
that the policy of aid to Britain
will not involve the United States
in war," he said. "Hitler will make
war on us, or on our friends and
allies in this hemisphere when, as,
and if he chooses. That is his rec
ord. But he is far less apt to be
aggressive while Britain stands,
than if she were to fall."
This is the sentiment of many who
have consistently advocated speedy
passage of the measure, but it is a
sentiment that has found perhaps
too little expression in arguments
favoring the bill.
This is the reasoning of those per
sons who favor the bill because they
believe aid to Britain is the best
policy to try to avoid war. Professor
Graham Stuart in the panel discus
sion Saturday called the measure
an excellent "insurance policy" for
the United States.
Most men who favor the bill want
the United States to stay out of war,
though they know no policy is an
absolute guarantee that their wishes
will be realized.

troops continued to pour
deeper into the Balkans yester
day and preparations were on foot
through the area for an extension
of the zone of hostilities.
In Budapest, capital of Hungary,
it was reported dozens of Nazi trans
port planes flew over the city on
their way to Rumania.
In Sofia, capital of Bulgaria, Ger
man "penetrations" were denied of
ficially. Prime Minister Winston
Churchill indicated in his message
Sunday that Nazi troops dressed as
civilians were invading Bulgaria as
advanced "tentacles" of an outright
military attack.
Observers in some quarters were
inclined to believe Churchill's as
sertion, and dismiss the official de
nials in Sofia. But the question re
mained, why should the Nazis use
plane transports to convey troops
into Rumania? The Nazis already
have a strong force in that country—
moved into the territory by land
across an unobstructed border.

A s he read from his prepared state
ment, Willkie touched upon al
most every aspect of the bill.
"No man can guarantee to you
that the policy of aid to Britain
will not involve the United States
in war," he said. "Hitler will make
war on us, or on our friends and
allies in this hemisphere when, as,
and if he chooses. That is his rec
ord. But he is far less apt to be
aggressive while Britain stands,
than if she were to fall."
This is the sentiment of many who
have consistently advocated speedy
passage of the measure, but it is a
sentiment that has found perhaps
too little expression in arguments
favoring the bill.
This is the reasoning of those per
sons who favor the bill because they
believe aid to Britain is the best
policy to try to avoid war. Professor
Graham Stuart in the panel discus
sion Saturday called the measure
an excellent "insurance policy" for
the United States.
Most men who favor the bill want
the United States to stay out of war,
though they know no policy is an
absolute guarantee that their wishes
will be realized.

troops continued to pour
deeper into the Balkans yester
day and preparations were on foot
through the area for an extension
of the zone of hostilities.
In Budapest, capital of Hungary,
it was reported dozens of Nazi trans
port planes flew over the city on
their way to Rumania.
In Sofia, capital of Bulgaria, Ger
man "penetrations" were denied of
ficially. Prime Minister Winston
Churchill indicated in his message
Sunday that Nazi troops dressed as
civilians were invading Bulgaria as
advanced "tentacles" of an outright
military attack.
Observers in some quarters were
inclined to believe Churchill's as
sertion, and dismiss the official de
nials in Sofia. But the question re

plane transports to convey troops
into Rumania? The Nazis already
have a strong force in that country—

WILLKIE, less than 48
hours after his whirlwind trip
abroad, testified before the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee yes
terday on the British-aid bill.
The testimony in many ways was
not startling, for it has been known
that Willkie favors passage of the
bill. But as he spoke yesterday,
Willkie had in his mind a picture
of the England that is fighting this
war. No other person who has ap
peared before either the Senate
committee or the House committee
has had this experience recently.
While vigorously endorsing the
bill, Willkie made several sugges
tions worthy of consideration—es
pecially since it is almost a fore
gone conclusion that the bill will
pass.
The former Republican presiden
tial nominee emphasized the need of
amendments to limit any "unneces
sary authortiy" for the President,
but at the same time admitted the
proposed "extraordinary" powers
were intended to meet an "extra
ordinary situation."
He said many members of Con
gress who believe in the general
objectives of t!ie bill are "sincerely
disturbed" by its broad grant of
powers to the President. To eradi

ord. But he is far less apt to be
aggressive while Britain stands,
than if she were to fall."
This is the sentiment of many who
have consistently advocated speedy
passage of the measure, but it is a
sentiment that has found perhaps
too little expression in arguments
favoring the bill.
This is the reasoning of those per
sons who favor the bill because they
believe aid to Britain is the best
policy to try to avoid war. Professor
Graham Stuart in the panel discus
sion Saturday called the measure
an excellent "insurance policy" for
the United States.
Most men who favor the bill want
the United States to stay out of war,
though they know no policy is an
absolute guarantee that their wishes
will be realized.

WILLKIE, less than 48
hours after his whirlwind trip
abroad, testified before the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee yes
terday on the British-aid bill.
The testimony in many ways was
not startling, for it has been known
that Willkie favors passage of the
bill. But as he spoke yesterday,
Willkie had in his mind a picture
of the England that is fighting this
war. No other person who has ap
peared before either the Senate
committee or the House committee
has had this experience recently.
While vigorously endorsing the
bill, Willkie made several sugges
tions worthy of consideration—es
pecially since it is almost a fore
gone conclusion that the bill will
pass.
The former Republican presiden
tial nominee emphasized the need of
amendments to limit any "unneces
sary authortiy" for the President,
but at the same time admitted the
proposed "extraordinary" powers
were intended to meet an "extra
ordinary situation."
He said many members of Con
gress who believe in the general
objectives of t!ie bill are "sincerely
disturbed" by its broad grant of
powers to the President. To eradi
cate this concern, he suggested the
Democratic majoi-ity "in the spirit
of candor and co-operation" try to
curtail to some extent the Presi
dent's tremendous sweep of power,
if this can be done without destroy
ing the objectives of the bill.
"It would be truly inspiring for
us and liberty loving people ev
erywhere if this bill could be
adopted with a non-partisan and
almost unanimous vote," he said.
He commented favorably on one
amendment which has been adopted
in the House version of the bill but
which has not gained widespread
attention. This amendment makes it
possible for Congress by a concur
rent resolution—by a majority vote
—to repeal the entire measure.

A s he read from his prepared state
ment, Willkie touched upon al
most every aspect of the bill.
"No man can guarantee to you
that the policy of aid to Britain
will not involve the United States
in war," he said. "Hitler will make
war on us, or on our friends and
allies in this hemisphere when, as,
and if he chooses. That is his rec
ord. But he is far less apt to be
aggressive while Britain stands,
than if she were to fall."
This is the sentiment of many who
have consistently advocated speedy
passage of the measure, but it is a
sentiment that has found perhaps
too little expression in arguments
favoring the bill.

sons who favor the bill because they
