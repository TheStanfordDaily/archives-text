# BUCKET, LANTERN, LADY, AND BOAT
## 
### JAN GOULD 
So Barbara Mock will have her
boat on the lake spring evenings,
and Stanford University is "relieved
of any responsibility f< r accidents
and/or other contingencies." Signed,
Richard Stepp.
And lake-goers in good weather
will see a small—a very small—out
rigger dinghy cruising around after
hours, containing one glass-bottomed
periscope, one bright lantern, and
perhaps the most determined woman
on the Stanford campus.
It all began last quarter when
Miss Mock, who graduated last June,
wanted to continue her studies in
biology by investigating lake plants.
Braving the comments of friends,
the reluctance of authority, and the
lack of even a pair of water wings,
she started looking for the right
people.
FOR ECOLOGY ONLY
First, permission. Professor Ira L.
Wiggins, for whom she is doing her
research in ecology—the relation of
plants and organisms to their en
vironment and to each other—sug
gested that she explore the possibili
ties of the plants in Lake Lagunita,
which is classed by geologists as an
intermittent reservoir. From there
it was necessary to get the permis

sion of the comptroller to utilize the
Inke before its official opening, and
after the 10 o'clock curfew; and
after "signing her life away," as
she put it, Miss Mock obtained the
following note from Dick Stepp, stu
dent manager.
"To Whom It May Concern:
"This is to certify that Miss Bar
bara Mock has been granted per
mission to use a boat on Lake La
gunita before official opening of the
Lake. This permit is extended so
that she might continue study for
Professor Wiggins on the Lake's
plant life. It is understood that the
permission is given to her alone, and
she has relieved the A.S.S.U. and
Stanford University of any respon
sibility for accidents and/or other
I contingencies."
BOAT BUILT IN A DAY
The "Nutrino" is the answer sup-
I plied by Harry Allred, graduate
student in physics, to the boat ques
• tion. Built on a Sunday morning
I from plans declared to have been
found in a "How to Build a Boat in
| Your Spare Time" column, the craft
is a flat-bottomed dinghy with an
outrigger to keep her steady, paint
ed white with a frieze of Little In
juns. The boat was christened re
cently with a test tube of alcohol
j from the physics department, and

its name is a scientific one meaning
"smaller than a neutron." After the
boat was built, Miss Mock and All
red spent spare time calking it with
cotton fiber and putty before they
put it into the water, where, its
owner declared, "it leaked buckets."
Warming to her favorite subject—
her research—Miss Mock talked of
her coming work on the lake.
"Those horrible little burrs that
everyone curses fall quarter? They
are the most interesting things on
campus. People don't know how
precious those things are.
TREMENDOUS SEEPAGE
"An inconceivable amount of wa
ter goes through the lake every day,
with about 1,000.000 gallons seeping
through the bottom alone," she
added.
Although provided with an after
hours leave and a boat of her own,
Miss Mock cannot take any super
cargo with her, because "Nutrino"
was not built to accommodate more
than one person at a time. As for the
rest of her research equipment, she
I said that all she needed now was
"some sort of glass-bottomed bucket,
only longer" to use as a periscope to
see the bottom of the lake. Where
j will I get it?
! "I'll build it!
I "I've done all right so far."
