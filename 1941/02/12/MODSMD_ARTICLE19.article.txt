# Bay Overflows To Innundate Paly Airport
## 
### 
The Palo Alto Airport was
flooded this morning when a high
tide backed by a strong wind caused
a 25-foot break in the dike protect
ing the north end of the field.
The entire field was covered by
water from the bay, with the excep
tion of a small part of a runway.
The rising water threatened planes
and so they had to be removed.
When the planes were warmed up,
pilots took them off on the only
runway, which was less than 400
feet long. These planes were flown
to Moffett Field. The larger air
craft, however, were kept at the air
port because they could not be
lifted from the short runway.
Although repair work will begin
immediately, the field cannot be
used for some time, according to
Harry White, owner of the airport.
City engineers explained that there
is no way to drain the water off.
