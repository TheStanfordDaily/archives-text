# Campus Queen Contest Isn't
## 
### 
"Is there a contest for cam
pus queen now going on?" asked
an anxious feminine voice over
The Daily's extension telephone
No. 2.
The surprised reporter knew
nothing of such a contest, nor
did anyone in the Shack. "We
don't know anything about it, but
why do you ask?"
A rather disappointed voice an
swered, "In my car this morning
I found a printed fi-hy-6 card
reading, 'Ilarkcn unto these words
â€”you, Miss So-and-so, have hcen
nominated for campus queen."
A pause.
And she banged down the phone.
