# Farm Skiers Go for Simple Snow Clothes

Vogue and local stores to the con
trary, you don't have to have a spe
cial wardrobe for skiing, judging
by the consensus of Stanford stu
dents.
Skis, boots, trousers, and a couple
of sweaters make up the equipment
that Fi irm students, male and female,
pack for Yosemite, Badger, arid other
ski points.
DETAILS COUNT
Emphasis is on the small details,
however: the boots must be well
oiled, the trousers should fit tightly
around the ankle, and the wind
breaker .should be damp- and cold
resistant. Also rating high is the
matter of changes of wool socks, mit
tens, scarf and ear muffs. Even the
hardy outdoor types wouldn't think
ol facing a day of skiing without
these essential protections.
Whether you have the fanciest
suspenders, tasseled socks, or em
broidered sweaters does not by any
means distinguish you as a real
skier. The lounge lizards are wel
come to their foxy trappings, but
you'll find the true stave artists will
choose attire for comfort and sim
plicity.
It's a cinch that where speed and
skill are concerned, that little Tyro
lean hat with the pheasant feather
tilted at such an intriguing angle
isn't going to come through.
A streamlined figure, tall and slim,
is accentuated by the downhill
trouser with that straight lean line
from hip bone to boot. Wear your
socks inside with downhills, and if
you must wear gaiters, wear knick
ers. Dark blue, green, or grey trous
ers are not only flattering, but also
practical. Gabardine is an old stand
y in materials, for it holds its shape

and is water-repellant when the rub
comes.
Accessories in bright colors, and
those nifty Jantzen sv/eaters really
fill the bill, but don't overdo it. For
(hose blizzardy days, parkas with
hoods are almost indispensable, and
those of oiled silk seem to take a lot
of punishment.
When your muscles ache, and a

hot drink and a round of bridge
sounds wonderful, you might slip
into a chic pair of beige doeskin
slacks and a precisely tailored jacket
for that much-needed rest.
We recommend Sloan s liniment as
+i sure cure for the creaks and crinks
of tiie day after, but remember thai
there's no sure cure for falling in
love with your ski instructor.

these essential protections.
Whether you have the fanciest
suspenders, tasseled socks, or em
broidered sweaters does not by any
means distinguish you as a real
skier. The lounge lizards are wel
come to their foxy trappings, but
you'll find the true stave artists will
choose attire for comfort and sim
plicity.
It's a cinch that where speed and
skill are concerned, that little Tyro
lean hat with the pheasant feather
tilted at such an intriguing angle
isn't going to come through.
A streamlined figure, tall and slim,
is accentuated by the downhill
trouser with that straight lean line
from hip bone to boot. Wear your
socks inside with downhills, and if
you must wear gaiters, wear knick
ers. Dark blue, green, or grey trous
ers are not only flattering, but also
practical. Gabardine is an old stand
y in materials, for it holds its shape

and is water-repellant when the rub
comes.
Accessories in bright colors, and
those nifty Jantzen sv/eaters really
fill the bill, but don't overdo it. For
(hose blizzardy days, parkas with
hoods are almost indispensable, and
those of oiled silk seem to take a lot
of punishment.
When your muscles ache, and a

hot drink and a round of bridge
sounds wonderful, you might slip
into a chic pair of beige doeskin
slacks and a precisely tailored jacket
for that much-needed rest.
We recommend Sloan s liniment as
+i sure cure for the creaks and crinks
of tiie day after, but remember thai
there's no sure cure for falling in
love with your ski instructor.
Vogue and local stores to the con
trary, you don't have to have a spe
cial wardrobe for skiing, judging
by the consensus of Stanford stu
dents.
Skis, boots, trousers, and a couple
of sweaters make up the equipment
that Fi irm students, male and female,
pack for Yosemite, Badger, arid other
ski points.
DETAILS COUNT
Emphasis is on the small details,
however: the boots must be well
oiled, the trousers should fit tightly
around the ankle, and the wind
breaker .should be damp- and cold
resistant. Also rating high is the
matter of changes of wool socks, mit
tens, scarf and ear muffs. Even the
hardy outdoor types wouldn't think
ol facing a day of skiing without
these essential protections.
