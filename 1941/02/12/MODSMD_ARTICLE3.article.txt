## 
### 
BUDAPEST, Feb. 11 (UP).
Fleets of huge German transpoi
planes, each carrying nearly 10
Nazi troops, sped over Budapest int
the Balkans today while Rumani
hurriedly strengthened her military
precautions against any surprise j
British bombings of the Rumanian
oil fields.
In the past 48 hours an estimated
100 German transport planes car
rying a total of perhaps 10,000
troops into Rumania and toward
Bulgaria have passed over the
Hungarian capital.
Reports that Adolf Hitler was
preparing to launch a "blitz" drive
in the Balkans could not be con
firmed here, however.
