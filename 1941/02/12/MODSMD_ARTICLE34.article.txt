## JERRY BRUCKER, Sports Editor Cagers Prep For Angry Trojan Five 
### 
II won't lie a bit surprising if
Coach Everett Dean's cagers find
themselves confronted hy a very
angry group of Trojans on the
Shrine court in Los Angeles this
week-end. For the poor boys from
Trey have been having a very luck
less season this year, and they're
about ready for a turnabout.
As a matter of fact, things have
been worse for U.S.C. this season, as
far as basketball is concerned, than
they have been for many a moon.
Here it is halfway through the sea
son and where do we find the Tro
jan hoop team but in last spot in
the conference standings.
On top of that the Trojans will
be forced to face the league-leading
Indians without the services of their
star guard, Captain Jack Lippert,
who has been declared ineligible
because of scholarship difficulties.
Oftimes a series of adverse condi
tions serves to turn a team into a
raging aggregation that won't be
beat; Stanford's Mr. Dean is just
hoping that this won't be the case
with U.S.C.
TROJANS STILL THERE
Following on the heels of Pro
fessor Hugh C. Willett's declaration
of Lippert's ineligibility, the Trojans
knocked over the Bruins from West
wood. which serves as evidence that
perhaps Coach Sam Barry's boys
aren't washed up after all.
The stage is set for Stanford to
practically cinch the southern divi
sion crown this week-end, but doing
that is apt to be a tougher job than
most people expect.
While dropping their 34th con
secutive basketball game to U S.C.
last Friday night, the Bruins sal
vaged something out of the debris
for Jackie Robinson, Ucla's jack-of
all-sports, jumped into the leader
ship in the conference scoring race, j
replacing Stanford's Don Burness, !
who was relegated to third place as I
John McGee of California moved
into the second spot. Indian Don !
Williams is fourth.
BEARS FACE TROUBLE
Chances are the Bruins will do our i
Indian hoopsters a good turn this
week-end when they run up against
their Berkeley cousins. For it is
doubtful if the Bears, Stanford's
main challengers for conference
honors, can whip U.C.L.A. two nights
in a row. Things like that just
aren't being done to the Bruins this
year. And if the Bears drop even
one contest before they meet Stan
ford in the final games of the season, j
their chances for overtaking the In
dians will suffer greatly â€” probably
irreparably.
