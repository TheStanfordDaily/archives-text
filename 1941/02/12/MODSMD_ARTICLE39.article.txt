Papooses, with the rest of the team
held in reserve. â€¢

| double bill against the high school
j teams, the frosh will resume their
annual feud with the Cal Cubs. The
Friday night encounter will be
played in the Stanford Pavilion, with
the second contest taking place on
the home grounds of the Cal frosh.

northerners, 37-34, last Friday and
will be out to make it a double and
cop the series. If Stanford wins the
second game, however, the third
will also be played.
