# Farm Ringmen To Face Aggies Here Friday
## 
### 
Meeting one of (he best intercol
legiate boxing outfits on the Coast,
Stanford's ringmen face the C'al Ag
gies from Davis Friday night at 8
(A'h t'k in the Pavilion. Coach Clay
ton Frye has been working his men
all weqk in preparation for the
match.
The evening's top bout should be
the Frank Hewitt-Toby Tobiassen
duel. Tobiassen, the Aggies' "Cin
derella fighter," won the Pacific
Cca.-t Intercollegiate championship
in the 145-pound class last year.
Hewitt, who won the all-University
crown in this division two weeks
ago, has been troubled with a cold
all week, but if he can reach top
shape by Friday, he stands a good
chance of beating the Farmer.
Another good fight should be the
heavyweight clash with Stanford's
pride, Johnny Ward, meeting Ralph
Colin. Colin showed plenty of class
by knocking out Oregon State's Ken
Pruitt a few weeks ago.
The Aggies sport some classy
fighters in all divisions, among them
Ha J Coombs, who reached the
P.C.I, finals in the lightweight
class last year.
Boxing at the northern institution
is a major sport along with football,
track, and basketball. The Aggies
were instrumental in bringing the
National Intercollegiate Champion
ships to Sacramento last year, and
earned much praise from visiting
mitt men.
