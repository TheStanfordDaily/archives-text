jyjORE notes and stuff pertaining
to the jumbled coaching situa
tion hereabouts.
They should be a mighty thankful
bunch of people down Santa Clara
way now that Buck Shaw has an
nounced his intention of continuing
to tutor the Bronco gridmen. And
they probably are, all but the
higher-ups who almost certainly
had to increase his salary some
what.
But whatever sum the Bronco
authorities had to hand out can be
considered money well spent in view
of the revenue Shaw-coached teams
have brought in. For a small school
Santa Clara has done mighty well in
a gridiron way in the past few years,
mighty well.
Something that strikes a little
closer to the Farm seems to he
coming up in connection with the
U.S.F. coaching job vacated by
George Malley.
# * *
'jj'HEY say that among those being
considered for the Don position
is a guy named Marchy Schwartz,
who in case you just came in, has
been doing a mighty nice job help
ing Clark Shaughnessy instruct the
Indian backs.
There are two things about this
deal, if it should come off, that we
don't like.
The first is that Stanford would
have to do a lot of looking to find a
man to replace Marchy. Assistant
coaches of his caliber are few and
far between. He knows inside foot
ball thoroughly and can explain it
clearly.
Our second objection looks at it
from another angle. If Schwartz is
offered the job and accepts, he'll
run into a very tough situation on
the Hilltop.
U.S.F. is a small school that plays
a tough schedule. The situation
right in the city makes it tough for
athletes to keep their minds on their
work, though this factor may be
overemphasized.
What appears to be a very disor
ganized alumni, with several fac
tions bickering back and forth, make
a coach's life up there unhappy.
What the San Francisco position
calls for is a combination politician.

! diplomat, and psychiatrist, not a
; football coach.

ALBANY is getting in deeper
and deeper, in a figurative as
well as a literal sense. When
Chairman Geisler handed out the
close-down order Monday the
track's chances to save something
out of the mess actually Hew out
the window.
About all you can give the direc
tors of the Golden Gate Turf Club
I credit for is colossal, unquenchable,
and asinine optimism.
Of course it's easy enough to con
demn the idea as a whacky pipe
dream now, and mayhap it isn't quite
sporting to kick 'em while they're
down, but the fact remains that the
idea was basically unsound.
No northern California track, in
view of what must be seen as sea
sonal weather condition, could hope
to have a successful season compet
ing with Santa Anita.
The class of horses running still
plays an important part in per
suading the suckers to chunk it in.
And, thoroughbreds being on the
whole had commuters, two major
tracks 500 miles apart cannot op
erate with any degree of co-oper
ation.
Of necessity there must be a war
for the services of the horses, and
here Santa Anita was in a far bet
ter position than Albany.

ALBANY is getting in deeper
and deeper, in a figurative as

Chairman Geisler handed out the
close-down order Monday the
track's chances to save something
out of the mess actually Hew out
the window.
About all you can give the direc
tors of the Golden Gate Turf Club
I credit for is colossal, unquenchable,
and asinine optimism.
Of course it's easy enough to con
demn the idea as a whacky pipe
dream now, and mayhap it isn't quite
sporting to kick 'em while they're
down, but the fact remains that the
idea was basically unsound.
No northern California track, in
view of what must be seen as sea
sonal weather condition, could hope
to have a successful season compet
ing with Santa Anita.
The class of horses running still
plays an important part in per
suading the suckers to chunk it in.
And, thoroughbreds being on the
whole had commuters, two major
tracks 500 miles apart cannot op
erate with any degree of co-oper
ation.
Of necessity there must be a war
for the services of the horses, and
here Santa Anita was in a far bet
ter position than Albany.
jyjORE notes and stuff pertaining
to the jumbled coaching situa

They should be a mighty thankful
bunch of people down Santa Clara
way now that Buck Shaw has an
nounced his intention of continuing
to tutor the Bronco gridmen. And
they probably are, all but the
higher-ups who almost certainly
had to increase his salary some
what.
But whatever sum the Bronco
authorities had to hand out can be
considered money well spent in view
of the revenue Shaw-coached teams
have brought in. For a small school
Santa Clara has done mighty well in
a gridiron way in the past few years,
mighty well.
Something that strikes a little

'jj'HEY say that among those being
considered for the Don position
is a guy named Marchy Schwartz,
who in case you just came in, has
been doing a mighty nice job help
ing Clark Shaughnessy instruct the
Indian backs.
There are two things about this
deal, if it should come off, that we
don't like.
The first is that Stanford would
have to do a lot of looking to find a
man to replace Marchy. Assistant
coaches of his caliber are few and
far between. He knows inside foot
ball thoroughly and can explain it
clearly.
Our second objection looks at it
from another angle. If Schwartz is
offered the job and accepts, he'll
run into a very tough situation on
the Hilltop.
U.S.F. is a small school that plays
a tough schedule. The situation
right in the city makes it tough for
athletes to keep their minds on their
work, though this factor may be
overemphasized.
