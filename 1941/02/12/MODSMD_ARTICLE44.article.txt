# Nine to Play Tenney Parkers Saturday
## 
### 
Yesterday's downpour forced can
cellation of the Gaddini's All-Star-
Cardinal baseball game, which was
to have been played here today.
Praying for no more rain, Coach
Harry Wolter scheduled a game with
Berkeley's Tenney Park nine for
Saturday afternoon at 2:30 o'clock.
