# Why 'Y'?
## 
### 
THE Y.W.C.A. started its annual finance drive
Monday night. It is hoped that by this Friday
S5OO will have been deposited in the "Y" cof
fers to help defray next year's expenses. After
reading this far, the eyes of the campus prob
ably turned the pages of Monday's Daily to
"Bull Session."
It's true that the campus is overrun with
drives, but that observation is less true this
v/inter quarter than last. The functioning of the
A.S.S.U. brain child, the drives committee, has
done a great deal to obviate the nuisance and
v/orry of eternally contributing to this and that,
as well as the strain on the allowance.
For this reason the importance of the "Y's"
drive should become more apparent. The fact
that the drives committee allowed the "Y" a
relatively quiet (financially speaking) time of
year indicates the importance that the commit
tee and the A.S.S.U. attribute to this cause and
to this organization. And with good reason.
The "Y" is one of the most unselfish campus
organizations. Everything done by it as a group
is done in the interest of the student body as a
whole, and for less fortunate individuals. The
"Y" deserves its tag —a service organization.
An examination of the activities carried on by
the group supports this statement. Its Discus
sion Groups—Social Service, Musical Appre
ciation, Volunteer Community Service, Trans
fer and Freshman Orientation, and Public Af
fairs and Tours—are all directed at the develop
ment of the individual or to contribute to Stan
ford life by developing in its members an aware
ness of what is happening in the world.
A breakdown of the expected proceeds of the
"Y's" finance drive reveals that the foregoing
groups are to receive but a very small portion
of the S5OO goal. Actually only 43 per cent of
the net will be spent on the campus group—
and that will go for general office expenses
mostly. The other 57 per cent?
Well, another breakdown shows that 25 per
cent of the expected $500 goal will go to the
Stanford Convalescent Home, 10 per cent to the
Berkeley Workers School Scholarship, 5 per
cent to students in beleaguered Chinese and
British universities, and 5 per cent for social
service projects—recreation for migrant chil
dren, American Red Cross, British War Relief,
etc.—and 12 per cent to send delegates to the
various Y.W.C.A. conferences where the pro
gram of the local group is co-ordinated with
the national scheme of the "Y."
Is it too much to ask Stanford students to con
tribute to these causes? The "Y" thinks not, and
the A.S.S.U. obviously concurs.
A dollar from each of 500 students, and the
"Y" will have obtained its goal, and those 500
students will have paid for one week of play
days for a migrant's child or a day's scholarship
at the Berkeley Workers School, or even for
five days' phone service for the Stanford group.
The point is that no matter how infinitesimal a
part of the "Y's" work that dollar will cover, it
will be of service.
The point is that if more than 500 students, say
even 1,000, contribute a like amount, the service
that the Stanford "Y" can give to its community
and to its members will be less than infinitesi
mal, and something in which the student body
as a whole may feel, proudly, that it has shared.
