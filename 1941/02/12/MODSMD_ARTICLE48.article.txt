# 'Far Into Tomorrow'
## 
### 
A HOSPITAL bed is no place to observe
either a triumph or a defeat.
It's senseless to talk about accidents; the
papers are full of them and the World Almanac
can probably furnish the inquiring man with
column on column of figures about where they
happen, how many of them happen, and how
they happen. But that's mighty thin stuff to
night. They do occur. That's all.
This editorial is traditionally dedicated to the
vanquished associate editor. It'll be a little
tough to direct this to you, Jerry, because you
won't be reading it tomorrow morning. The
shades are drawn in your hospital room and
there's a little red card on the door that says,
"No visitors."
You know all the old stuff, though, Humph.
You've read it before from a half dozen Daily
chiefs to "the man who won't be back." You
can reflect, more or less contentedly, on three
and a half years of competition, on the rough
times and the smooth ones. You'll recall that
first sports beat you handled and the way you
phoned in intramural scores from the drafty
phone-booth on the third floor of Encina. And
you'll remember grinding out Sideline Slants
from the mill every day and the way you griped
v/hen the night editors used to hack your punch
line.
They'll remember you for a while around
the Shack, too, for a swell news sense, for the
way you headed those U.P. stories in nothing
flat, for a liberal, inquiring editorial bent that
kept you always poking into questionable sub

jects and laughing at trumped-up ideas. Even
though you'd probably never admit it, you were
cast a lot in the mould of "the crusading college
editor."
But you won't be reading these words tomor
row. When the doctor finally says "All right"
and the nurse pulls up the shades and cranks
up that high, steel hospital bed, there'll be a lot
of people outside the door. Maybe I'll be one
of them, because I'll want to say these things
to you.
But I won't say them well. It'll just be,
"Sorry." And "Thanks."

But you won't be reading these words tomor
row. When the doctor finally says "All right"
and the nurse pulls up the shades and cranks
up that high, steel hospital bed, there'll be a lot
of people outside the door. Maybe I'll be one
of them, because I'll want to say these things
to you.
But I won't say them well. It'll just be,
"Sorry." And "Thanks."
A HOSPITAL bed is no place to observe
either a triumph or a defeat.
It's senseless to talk about accidents; the
papers are full of them and the World Almanac
can probably furnish the inquiring man with
column on column of figures about where they
happen, how many of them happen, and how
they happen. But that's mighty thin stuff to
night. They do occur. That's all.
This editorial is traditionally dedicated to the
vanquished associate editor. It'll be a little
tough to direct this to you, Jerry, because you
won't be reading it tomorrow morning. The
shades are drawn in your hospital room and
there's a little red card on the door that says,
"No visitors."
You know all the old stuff, though, Humph.
You've read it before from a half dozen Daily
chiefs to "the man who won't be back." You
can reflect, more or less contentedly, on three
and a half years of competition, on the rough
times and the smooth ones. You'll recall that
first sports beat you handled and the way you
phoned in intramural scores from the drafty
phone-booth on the third floor of Encina. And
you'll remember grinding out Sideline Slants
from the mill every day and the way you griped
v/hen the night editors used to hack your punch
line.
They'll remember you for a while around
the Shack, too, for a swell news sense, for the
way you headed those U.P. stories in nothing
flat, for a liberal, inquiring editorial bent that
kept you always poking into questionable sub

jects and laughing at trumped-up ideas. Even
though you'd probably never admit it, you were
cast a lot in the mould of "the crusading college
editor."
