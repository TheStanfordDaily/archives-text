### BUD AMES 
HOW TO WIN AN ELECTION
to the front page of this paper, the
fall elections are all over. Not that they were
ever on. This fall election just never seems to cause
any bloody commotions. Fall elections, pooh. The
hallmen never seem to care. The rowmen never seem
to care.
But wait until the spring election. Wait. Then you
will see more alliances than an octopus in a factory of
plumber's helpers.
If you're in doubt, you can ask the guy next -o you
about what a plumber's helper is.
And since spring elections do, for some strange
reason, seem more important to all you student read
ers, here are a few tips on how to get you or your
friend into office in the next election.
Better cut these out and save them. Nothing like
this, so pertinent, so timely, so authentic, so all-inclu
sive, will ever again be printed.

''JMPS on How You Too Can Be a Campus Figure.
Always carry at least eight different packs of cig
arettes, each a different brand. You must always have
just the brand that the potential voter likes. If he
smokes 10-cent cigarettes—you'll just have to carry
them, too. If he rolls his own—you guessed it.
Make several carbon copies of all your lecture
notes. Then as exams come around, you can loan
them around to all the desperates. No matter how
corrupt you are, you can always rake in these votes—
if they're REALLY desperate.
If you're a man, take a different date to the Mark
or St. Francis every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday
night. If you're a woman, use the conveyor-belt sys
tem for sandwiching in coke dates.
Know everybody—simply everybody—on campus by
name. Yes, every name of every one of the 5000 stu
dents. Just "hy, fellow, what ya' know" won't do.
And if you call Hugo something like Ferdinand, well,
you never can tell how many blocs of votes will go
the wrong way.
Read all the Campus Opinion letters, and take your
cue from them. Then tell everybody that you agree
with what they said. Down with the Cellar cokes.
Down with the Cellar coffee. Down with the people
who don't give you rides to Paly. Down the chaser.
Down with everything.
* H 1 *
DE seen at ALL times, at the RIGHT places with
" the RIGHT people.
Go minus in the Bawlout. Then you're one of the
majority. That always helps.
Buy a 12-passenger 1945 Cadillac Special. Then
at noon every day, run a taxi service from the post
office to every place on the campus.
Be the only candidate running.
Become president of Stanford and then do away
with all 8 o'clocks. If you could do away with 9
o'clocks too that would mean a mess more votes.
Hire a French chef for Roble. That's 300 votes
cinched.
Stuff the ballot box.
And then, if you're still in school—brother, you de
serve being head of Clean-up Committee after the
Pre-registration Frosh Barbecue.

Always carry at least eight different packs of cig
arettes, each a different brand. You must always have
just the brand that the potential voter likes. If he
smokes 10-cent cigarettes—you'll just have to carry
them, too. If he rolls his own—you guessed it.
Make several carbon copies of all your lecture
notes. Then as exams come around, you can loan
them around to all the desperates. No matter how
corrupt you are, you can always rake in these votes—
if they're REALLY desperate.
If you're a man, take a different date to the Mark
or St. Francis every Friday, Saturday, and Sunday
night. If you're a woman, use the conveyor-belt sys
tem for sandwiching in coke dates.
Know everybody—simply everybody—on campus by
name. Yes, every name of every one of the 5000 stu
dents. Just "hy, fellow, what ya' know" won't do.
And if you call Hugo something like Ferdinand, well,
you never can tell how many blocs of votes will go
the wrong way.
Read all the Campus Opinion letters, and take your
cue from them. Then tell everybody that you agree
with what they said. Down with the Cellar cokes.
Down with the Cellar coffee. Down with the people
who don't give you rides to Paly. Down the chaser.
Down with everything.

Buy a 12-passenger 1945 Cadillac Special. Then
at noon every day, run a taxi service from the post
office to every place on the campus.
Be the only candidate running.
Become president of Stanford and then do away

Hire a French chef for Roble. That's 300 votes
