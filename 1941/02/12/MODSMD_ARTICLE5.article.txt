last night that Stanford is, in the
eyes of the sovereign state of Cali
fornia, a fish and game district.

firearms. At present, it is illegal for
a student to own a gun under the
fish and game laws, but negotia
tions now under way may result in
modification of this ruling.
If the ruling is amended, it was
recommended last night that a cen
tral storing place for the guns be
constructed.
Other business of the Committee
follows:
WORLD AFFAIRS DAY: Bob
Einstein, chairman, announced that
Dr. Robert Gordon Sproul, presi
dent of the University of California,
will be unable to speak here on
World Affairs Day. With professional
speakers exceeding the A.S.S.U.
budget, Excom decided to let the
whole matter ride a while.
CONERT SERIES ASSISTANTS:
Committee voted down a proposal
to increase the salaries of the two
concert series assistants on the
grounds that these people were
working toward a fairly well-paid
position and that the increase would
put their salaries out of proportion
to other salaried student jobs.
