## OURS BUT TO DIE

EDITOR, SIR:
Have you had your casket fitting yet? Well, you
better attend to this matter immediately. It has just
been revealed that the army has ordered 1,500,000 cas
kets as well as 4,500,000 identification tags for identi
fying our bloody torsos. No, there is nothing like an
absolute government.
In case you had any doubt about our fighting over
seas, dismiss it immediately. Our army is now plan
ning the construction of transports. Silly of us to
have any ideas about these things because the men
in Washington have our future well sewed up.
Informed sources in Washington expect us to enter
the war by fighting Japan in her attempt to invade
Sumatra, Malay, and Borneo. Oh, you don't know
exactly where the places are. Well, start looking at the
maps because you may even die for these bits of
British and Dutch jungle.
