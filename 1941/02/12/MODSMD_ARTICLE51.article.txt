# 'ANY' SLIPS COUNT

r PHE EDITOR, SIR:
The text of the Lease-Lend bill should have the
close and immediate attention of every American
blessed with literacy. It should be carefully read to
every illiterate. And every small word should be
deeply pondered. The most intense concentration
should be applied to one very small word that is
repeated again and again, almost with wearying in
sistence. The word is "any." Any slips into the bill
very inconspicuously. Anyone could miss it. Sec
tion II includes any weapon, etc.: any machinery, etc.;
any component material, etc.; any other commodity,
etc.; any article, etc.; any foreign government, etc.;
any plan, etc.; any defense article, etc.; Section 111 be
gins to betray the profundity and the comprehensive
ness of any. Here we find: "Notwithstanding the pro
visions of any other law . . . any other department;
. . . any defense article; any country whose defense
the President deems vital ... to any such govern
ment," etc. Section 111 Roes deeper into any when it
refers to "any other direct or indirect benefit which the
President deems satisfactory." Section IV has a
sprinkling of any, as has Section V. But there is a
very important little any in Section VI: "Out of any
money in the Treasury, not otherwise appropriated."
Thore is a rest for anv in Section VII and VIII, but
in Section IX, the President has power to "promulgate
such rules and regulations as may be necessary and
proper to carry out any of the proposals of the act."
And he may exercise any power of authority con
ferred on him through this act through such depart
ment or agency or officer as he shall direct." The
immortal framers of the bill slipped in that last line,
by using such instead of any. Perhaps they did not
have another any left. Taking the Lease-Lend bill as
a whole, it seems that there is not any power which the
President at any time who held any such power. And
the people cannot do anything about it. But they
are sure that at any time any bill like this may carry
this, or any other country into any war on this or any
other planet.

sistence. The word is "any." Any slips into the bill
very inconspicuously. Anyone could miss it. Sec
tion II includes any weapon, etc.: any machinery, etc.;
any component material, etc.; any other commodity,
etc.; any article, etc.; any foreign government, etc.;
any plan, etc.; any defense article, etc.; Section 111 be
gins to betray the profundity and the comprehensive
ness of any. Here we find: "Notwithstanding the pro
visions of any other law . . . any other department;
. . . any defense article; any country whose defense
the President deems vital ... to any such govern
ment," etc. Section 111 Roes deeper into any when it
refers to "any other direct or indirect benefit which the
President deems satisfactory." Section IV has a
sprinkling of any, as has Section V. But there is a
very important little any in Section VI: "Out of any
money in the Treasury, not otherwise appropriated."
Thore is a rest for anv in Section VII and VIII, but
in Section IX, the President has power to "promulgate
such rules and regulations as may be necessary and
proper to carry out any of the proposals of the act."
And he may exercise any power of authority con
ferred on him through this act through such depart
ment or agency or officer as he shall direct." The
immortal framers of the bill slipped in that last line,
by using such instead of any. Perhaps they did not
have another any left. Taking the Lease-Lend bill as
a whole, it seems that there is not any power which the
President at any time who held any such power. And
the people cannot do anything about it. But they
are sure that at any time any bill like this may carry
this, or any other country into any war on this or any
other planet.

The text of the Lease-Lend bill should have the
close and immediate attention of every American
blessed with literacy. It should be carefully read to
every illiterate. And every small word should be
deeply pondered. The most intense concentration
should be applied to one very small word that is
repeated again and again, almost with wearying in
sistence. The word is "any." Any slips into the bill
very inconspicuously. Anyone could miss it. Sec
