One of the skier's hapipest compendiums is the ski chapter contained
in the Encyclopedia of Sports, hy Frank G. Menke, which traces the his
tory of skiing from primitive times in sections of Asia and the Old
Country right up to date.
Interesting facts to be gleaned from a perusal of the handy volume
follow. ~

The ski is man's oldest means of
traveling over the snow and ice. It
is the grandaddy of the sled", skates,
snowshoes, bobsleds, and the to
boggan . . . the earliest ski runners
were made of the bones of large
animals, these being strapped to the
shoes by means of leather thongs . . .
modern skiers have found the per
fect ski is the one which reaches
from the ground to the wrist of an
upstretched arm — the standard
measurement which exists today.
BEST SKI WOOD
The best timber for skis is Ameri
can second-growth shag—shellbark
white hickory—from the forests of
Minnesota . . . also ash, yellow pine,
maple and birch . . . skis were used
at least 2000 years before Christ . . .
the Mongols of Northern Asia
equipped not only themselves but
their horses with skis 30 centuries
ago.
Skis were first used in warfare at
the battle of Oslo, Norway, in 1200
A.D. . . . skiing was introduced into
Central Europe via Austria in 1580
. . . today fans ski on the slopes of
snow-capped peaks in Hawaii . . .
the first jumpers known to the
United States were two youthful
brothers—Torgus and Mikkcl Hem
mestvedt—who were living in Red
Wing, Minn., and who gained local
fame that spread finally throughout
the state, by jumping from reason
ably high hills without breaking
their necks.
QUICK POPULARITY
No sport ever adopted by the
United States has ever made such
tremendous strides in popularity as
has skiing or "sheing" since 1930,
when it was almost unknown, to the
present time . . . more than 1,500,000
persons went in for one form or an
other of skiing during the 1937-38
winter, and they spent around $150,-
000,000 for equipment, toggery,
traveling, hotel and incidental ex
penses.
Skiing, as a competitive sport, is
divided into five sections: jumping—
most spectacular, flying kilometer —
most dangerous, slalom—most grace
ful, cross country—most gruelling,
skijoring — a horse pulls the fan
along over the ice, a novelty sport.
Points are voted in jumping for
four reasons—distance, courage, con
trol while racing down, while in
flight, while landing and slowing to
the finish, and form or gracefulness.
FLYING KILOMETER
The flying kilometer is a down
hill event, the steeper the hill the
better . . . the rules permit a 150-
foot flying start . . . the course is
usually iced . . . the highest pos
sible rate of speed is the ambition
. . . the skis are speically built, of
extra heavy. hickory . . . each is
loaded with slabs of lead to accel
erate descent . . . each ski weighs
25 or more pounds and is 6 inches
wide . . . competitors wear heavy
goggles and usually a hood . . . the
speed attained sometimes reaches
close to 90 miles an hour ... if a
racer hits a snag or obstruction of
any kind, or if he makes a blunder
in steering, he goes hurtling into
space.—Shafer

loaded with slabs of lead to accel

25 or more pounds and is 6 inches
wide . . . competitors wear heavy
goggles and usually a hood . . . the
speed attained sometimes reaches
close to 90 miles an hour ... if a

Skis were first used in warfare at
the battle of Oslo, Norway, in 1200
A.D. . . . skiing was introduced into
Central Europe via Austria in 1580
. . . today fans ski on the slopes of
snow-capped peaks in Hawaii . . .
the first jumpers known to the
United States were two youthful
brothers—Torgus and Mikkcl Hem
mestvedt—who were living in Red
Wing, Minn., and who gained local
fame that spread finally throughout
the state, by jumping from reason
ably high hills without breaking
their necks.
QUICK POPULARITY
No sport ever adopted by the
United States has ever made such
tremendous strides in popularity as
has skiing or "sheing" since 1930,
when it was almost unknown, to the
present time . . . more than 1,500,000
persons went in for one form or an
other of skiing during the 1937-38
winter, and they spent around $150,-
000,000 for equipment, toggery,
traveling, hotel and incidental ex
penses.
Skiing, as a competitive sport, is
divided into five sections: jumping—
most spectacular, flying kilometer —
most dangerous, slalom—most grace
ful, cross country—most gruelling,
skijoring — a horse pulls the fan
along over the ice, a novelty sport.
Points are voted in jumping for
four reasons—distance, courage, con
trol while racing down, while in
flight, while landing and slowing to
the finish, and form or gracefulness.
FLYING KILOMETER
The flying kilometer is a down
hill event, the steeper the hill the
better . . . the rules permit a 150-
foot flying start . . . the course is
usually iced . . . the highest pos
sible rate of speed is the ambition
. . . the skis are speically built, of
extra heavy. hickory . . . each is
loaded with slabs of lead to accel
erate descent . . . each ski weighs
25 or more pounds and is 6 inches
wide . . . competitors wear heavy
goggles and usually a hood . . . the
speed attained sometimes reaches
close to 90 miles an hour ... if a
racer hits a snag or obstruction of
any kind, or if he makes a blunder
in steering, he goes hurtling into
space.—Shafer
