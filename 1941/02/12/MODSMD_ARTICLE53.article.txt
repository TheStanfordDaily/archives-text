## Paly Stores Donate Clothes for Show

There will be a very important
meeting of all the models for the
County Fair Fashion Show today at
4:30 o'clock in the Women's Club
house. According to Peggy Jadden,
chairman, the absence of many of
the girls at last week's meeting ne
cessitates another drawing for the
stores whose clothes each girl will
model. Due to the importance of
this meeting, any girl who fails to
attend and has no legitimate excuse
will be automatically eliminated.
Ten Palo Alto stores are contrib
uting clothes to be shown, and it is
necessary that all models get in
touch with their store as soon as
possible. The stores are Sue Berry,
Carolyn Kelsey, Roos Bros., Joseph
Magnin, Hinks, Walster's, Bryant's,
the Seven-to-Seventeen Shop, Mary
Roy, and the Clothes Closet.
The show, which will be some
thing out of the ordinary in fashion
shows, according to the committee,
will feature the latest in spring
clothes with emphasis on what will
be seen on and around campus dur
ing spring quarter. Isabelle Fawcett
will act as commentator.
The committee has also chosen ten
girls to act as contact girls between
the stores whose clothes will be
shown and the models. They are:
Carroll Edwards, Juanita Gossman,
Jane Harrington, Virginia Sisk, Lois
Jean Walker, Mary Weaver, Shirley
Okell, Priscilla Reynolds, Barbara
Atwood, and Natalie Kitchin.
