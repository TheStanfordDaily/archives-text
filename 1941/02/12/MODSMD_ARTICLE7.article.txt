# Behrman Drama to Open Run In Little Theater Tonight, 8:15
## 
### 
"Rain from Heaven" opens a four-night run tonight in the Little
Theater at 8:15 o'clock.
The satire by Samuel Bchrman was chosen as a part of the 50-year
drama festival which the Speech and Drama Division is putting on honor
ing the University's Golden Jubilee.

oenrman is well up on the list oi,
outstanding American playwrights,
ind his work exemplifies the mod
ern trend of the last 50 years.
Although it was written seven
years ago, and although the world
has moved past rapidly since its
writing, still, "Rain from Heaven"
hits home when it comes to com
mentary on contemporary affairs.
! Although it was written before
the war, Behrman had a feeling of
war's imminence and some of the
sentiments that are current today
can be heard in Lady Wyngate's
sentiments. She appears to exem
plify the England of then, of now,
and of the future.
F. Cowles Strickland, director of
dramatics, is directing the play and
takes special interest since he spent
a summer near Behrman in Stock-
Idge when he was writing "Rain
om Heaven."
Strickland was present at all the
writes and rehashes of the play,
while Behrman was writing it for
Itia Claire, so he has an inside idea
of what Behrman had in mind when
lii wrote the play.
