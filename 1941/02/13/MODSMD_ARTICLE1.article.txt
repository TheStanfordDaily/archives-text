### BOB LOW 
planes carrying Ger
man troops two days ago were
reported flying over Budapest, Hun
gary en route to Rumania. Accord
ing to dispatches from the Hungarian
capital, the planes flew so low the
Nazi markings on the undersides of
the planes' wings were clearly vis
ible.
Yesterday, the report that these
planes were flying toward Rumania
sounded even more unreasonable
than it did two days ago. Why
should the German High Command
send additional troops to Rumania by
air? The country has already been
occupied by an estimated 200,000
German troops who entered the
country by land.
The United Press correspondent in
Budapest yesterday told of another
100 German transports flying over
the city. This time he did not say
they were flying to Rumania; he said
they were "speeding on into the
Balkans."
From other European sources
there came the news that 30,000
troops had invaded Bulgaria and
now the story of German trans
ports over Budapest is beginning
to make sense. The troop trans
ports over Budapest were on the'?
way to the interior of Bulgaria.
Sunday, Prime Minister Churchill
asserted the "advanced tentacles" of
the German army and air force were
already in Bulgaria. His words are
now finding confirmation.
In Sofia, capital of Bulgaria, no
official would comment publicly on
the presence of German troops
within the borders of the nation.
However, some news, perhaps sig
nificant, did trickle out of the Bul
garian Parliament.
Bulgarian Premier Bogdan FilolT,
speaking before Parliament, de
clared German technicians were
in control of the nation's air fields
"in the mutual interests of Ger
many and Bulgaria." This was re
ported in Budapest by a diplo
matic official who had just re
turned from Sofia.
Another diplomat, arriving in
Budapest from Rumania, asserted
German troops had already pushed
across into Bulgaria and that a Nazi
drive southward might be expected
within a few days.

Jj ITTLE opposition, if any, is ex
pected from Bulgaria should
Germany use the country as an ave
nue for an attack on Greece to re
lieve the pressure on the Italians
and to create a new war front for
Britain.
It is less than a hundred miles
from the Bulgarian border to Sa
lonika, Greece's chief port on the
Aegian. German mechanized divi
sions could be expected to traverse
this ground with great force, for the
terrain here is a great deal better
suited for "blitzkrieg" tactics than
the mountainous region invaded by
the Italians.
But some observers believe Ger
man troops will not attempt an in
vasion of Greece but will remain
poised on the Greek border in an
effort to "pressure" the Greeks into
signing a truce with Mussolini.
Although Turkey has a mutual
defense pact with Greece, many
believe Turkey will remain a
"non-belligerent" unless her ter
ritory is subjected to attack.
Turkey* has indicated its sym
pathy for Britain with continual,
though not stupendous, aid to the
British forces. The Turks, for in
stance, have not permitted supply
ships to reach Italy's Dodecanese
Islands, located off the Turkish
coast.

| AST fall when King Carol was
forced to abdicate from the
throne of Rumania, it was predicted
freely that the long-waited for Ger
man drive-to-the-East would be at
tempted within a few months. Ger
man troops subsequently occupied
Rumania and favorable trade treaties
were reported between Bulgaria and
Germany.
King Boris went to Germany for
a talk with Hitler, and German pres
sure was reported being exerted on
Yugoslavia. All these items were
looked on as preliminary measures
for the actual drive.
