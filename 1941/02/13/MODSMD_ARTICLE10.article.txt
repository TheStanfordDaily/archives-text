# Dr. Hawkins Outlines Duties Of Modern-Day Philosophers
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
To promote, if possible, "good political thinking" is the philosopher's
job in these days of war and national emergency, according to Dr. David
Hawkins, Stanford philosophy instructor.
"A great many of the citizens of this country are talking in terms of
contingencies, and what will happen if . . ." Dr. Hawkins said in an
__ ▲interview yesterday.

His contention is that some of the
factors in the political situation are
within our control and some are not;
that "it's just useless speculation to

For example, he noted that there
are certain "political alchemists"
who think we can reach a good so

the subject will show that the kind
of efficiency fascism has to offer is
based precisely on the destruction

In regard to "soothsayers" who tell
us that if we don't enter the war
against Germany at this time, Ger
many will conquer us later, Dr.
Hawkins says:
"This may or may not be true but,
if we act on that alone, we slide over
many vital issues, and eventually we
will get left feeling like a victim of
Fate. Good political thinking starts
with the whole present situation, and
with the things in that situation that
we can control. If it is necessary to
have strong national defense, we
want to see to it that we actually
get that and not something else."
MUCH TO DEFEND
"This means above all that we
continue to have much to defend,
that we redouble our efforts to se
cure adequate living standards, that
we be prepared to protect our civil
and academic liberties. These are
