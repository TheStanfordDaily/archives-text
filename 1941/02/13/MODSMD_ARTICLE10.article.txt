# Dr. Hawkins Outlines Duties Of Modern-Day Philosophers
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
To promote, if possible, "good political thinking" is the philosopher's
job in these days of war and national emergency, according to Dr. David
Hawkins, Stanford philosophy instructor.
"A great many of the citizens of this country are talking in terms of
contingencies, and what will happen if . . ." Dr. Hawkins said in an
__ ▲interview yesterday.

His contention is that some of the
factors in the political situation are
within our control and some are not;
that "it's just useless speculation to
pay all our attention to the things
that aren't within our control."
The philosophers, Dr. Hawkins
says, cannot tell America what to
do, but they can say a good deal
about how to know what to do.
DO THEY MIX?
For example, he noted that there
are certain "political alchemists"
who think we can reach a good so
ciety by combining the "efficiency"
of fascism with the "values" of de
mocracy. Yet concrete thinking on
the subject will show that the kind
of efficiency fascism has to offer is
based precisely on the destruction
of democracy, he.stated.
In regard to "soothsayers" who tell
us that if we don't enter the war
against Germany at this time, Ger
many will conquer us later, Dr.
Hawkins says:
"This may or may not be true but,
if we act on that alone, we slide over
many vital issues, and eventually we
will get left feeling like a victim of
Fate. Good political thinking starts
with the whole present situation, and
with the things in that situation that
we can control. If it is necessary to
have strong national defense, we
want to see to it that we actually
get that and not something else."
MUCH TO DEFEND
"This means above all that we
continue to have much to defend,
that we redouble our efforts to se
cure adequate living standards, that
we be prepared to protect our civil
and academic liberties. These are
the issues within our control; when
we think in terms of them, we aren't
left feeling like victims of Fate."
In commenting on the trends of
present-day thought likely to af
fect modern philosophers, he stated
that there seems to be a growing
disillusionment with the whole lib
eral and scientific attitude.
"NOBLE LIE"
"And the attack on the best social
knowledge we have comes from
within as well as without," he re
marked. "Many American writers
seem to be bidding for the place the
Hitlerian apologists occupy in Ger
many."
According to Dr. Hawkins the
Stoics' adoption of Plato's "noble lie"
theory (i..e, one must deceive the
people in order to rule for their
own interests) was largely respon
sible for the break-down of ancient
scientific attitudes. And eventually
philosophy became "sodden with
superstition."
MUST GUAKI)
It is this same sort of thing against
which we must guard today," he
stated. "With this difference—re
ligion was the touchy subject then.
Today it "is politics."
"But," he concluded, "the basis of
democracy is the truth." "When you
take away the philosopher's right to
tell the truth, democracy is gone.
Then he must do as he has done in
Germany—retire to an ivory tower
and worry about symbolic logic, or
become an official apologist for the
regime."

"A great many of the citizens of this country are talking in terms of

His contention is that some of the
factors in the political situation are
within our control and some are not;
that "it's just useless speculation to
pay all our attention to the things
that aren't within our control."
The philosophers, Dr. Hawkins
says, cannot tell America what to
do, but they can say a good deal
about how to know what to do.
DO THEY MIX?
For example, he noted that there
are certain "political alchemists"
who think we can reach a good so
ciety by combining the "efficiency"
of fascism with the "values" of de
mocracy. Yet concrete thinking on
the subject will show that the kind
of efficiency fascism has to offer is
based precisely on the destruction
of democracy, he.stated.
In regard to "soothsayers" who tell
us that if we don't enter the war
against Germany at this time, Ger
many will conquer us later, Dr.
Hawkins says:
"This may or may not be true but,
if we act on that alone, we slide over
many vital issues, and eventually we
will get left feeling like a victim of
Fate. Good political thinking starts
with the whole present situation, and
with the things in that situation that
we can control. If it is necessary to
have strong national defense, we
want to see to it that we actually
get that and not something else."
MUCH TO DEFEND
"This means above all that we
continue to have much to defend,
that we redouble our efforts to se
cure adequate living standards, that
we be prepared to protect our civil
and academic liberties. These are
the issues within our control; when
we think in terms of them, we aren't
left feeling like victims of Fate."
In commenting on the trends of
present-day thought likely to af
fect modern philosophers, he stated
that there seems to be a growing
disillusionment with the whole lib
eral and scientific attitude.
"NOBLE LIE"
"And the attack on the best social
knowledge we have comes from
within as well as without," he re

seem to be bidding for the place the

According to Dr. Hawkins the
Stoics' adoption of Plato's "noble lie"
theory (i..e, one must deceive the
people in order to rule for their
own interests) was largely respon
sible for the break-down of ancient
scientific attitudes. And eventually
philosophy became "sodden with
superstition."
