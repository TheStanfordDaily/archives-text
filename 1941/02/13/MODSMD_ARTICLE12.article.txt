## 
### 
CAIRO, Feb. 12 (UP). — Already
many hard-fought miles past To
bruk and the Italian prisoners (seen
Tin picture to the left) British mili
tary commanders said that tlie im
portant Italian oasis of Giarahuh, 125
miles south of Bardia and one of the
' last remaining pockets of Italian
resistance in eastern Libya, might
fall soon.
British land and air forces struck
deeper into Italy's east African em
pire on four fronts Wednesday, and
reports reached Cairo that Marshal
Rodolfo Graziani, commander-in
chief of the shattered Fascist army
in north Africa, had left, for Rome
| by airplane.
The reports that. Graziani had
I flown home, perhaps on orders of
Premier Benito Mussolini, came
from the captured Italian base of
Benghazi in eastern Libya but lacks
confirmation.
It also was reported here the
17,879-ton crack Italian liner Conte
Rosso had struck an Italian mine in
I the Mediterranean while en route to
Sicily with refugees from north
Africa and that many were drowned.
What appeared to have been the
heaviest British air raid thus far on
| Germany's Stuka bases.


IN THE WAKE of Britain's fast-advancing Army of the Nile, ruins of Tobruk. with nibble-covered streets
and shell-marked buildings, were left behind. Here's the lirst picture from Tobruk, with long lines of
Italian naval prisoners on their way to concentration camps. (Cablcphoto from London.)
