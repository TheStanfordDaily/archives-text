# 'Y.W.' Finance Drivers Expect $500 by Friday
## Contributions Still Needed to Complete Expected Collections 
### 
The Y.W.C.A. annual finance
drive, now in its fourth day, will
supply the money to pay for the
"Y's" 50th year on the Stanford
campus. Helen Johnson, chairman
of the drive, expects that the $500
goal will be reached tomorrow, the
last day, in order that the "Y" may
continue to carry out its work of
providing special activities for
women on the campus.
The opportunities which the "Y"
offers have been expanded to such
an extent that this year 13 groups
have been organized to supplement
the academic work of its members.
The Social Service, Music Apprecia
tion, Volunteer Community Service
Discussion, Marriage and the Home,
Freshman Discussion, and the Youth
Hostels are only a few of these
groups now being offered by the "Y."
HOLD MEETINGS
The members interested in each of
these special activities hold meetings
either every week or every other
week. Some of the more active "Y"
members who are chairmen of the
group meetings are Betty Augur,
Dorothea Harr, Margaret Brigham,
Norma McKenzie, Ellen Moule, B. J.
Binney, Jeanne Chambers, and Hel
en Severance. The variety of inter
est groups is a great advance over
the opportunities offered when the
"Y" was founded.
49 YEARS OLD
Forty-nine years ago a group of
Stanford women and some regular
Y.W.C.A. members organized a
Stanford chapter. Since that time
many prominent women have been
members. Mrs. Theresa Wilbur
Paist, Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur's sis
ter, was an early leader and spon
sor of the association, and was at
one time secretary of the "Y."
If 500 campus women have do
nated their dollars by tomorrow, the
charitable work of the Stanford
Y.W.C.A. will be able to continue
for another year.

Forty-nine years ago a group of
Stanford women and some regular
Y.W.C.A. members organized a
Stanford chapter. Since that time
many prominent women have been
members. Mrs. Theresa Wilbur
Paist, Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur's sis
ter, was an early leader and spon
sor of the association, and was at
one time secretary of the "Y."
If 500 campus women have do
nated their dollars by tomorrow, the
charitable work of the Stanford
Y.W.C.A. will be able to continue
for another year.
The Y.W.C.A. annual finance
drive, now in its fourth day, will
supply the money to pay for the
"Y's" 50th year on the Stanford
campus. Helen Johnson, chairman
of the drive, expects that the $500
goal will be reached tomorrow, the
last day, in order that the "Y" may
continue to carry out its work of
providing special activities for
women on the campus.
The opportunities which the "Y"
offers have been expanded to such
an extent that this year 13 groups
have been organized to supplement
the academic work of its members.
The Social Service, Music Apprecia
tion, Volunteer Community Service
Discussion, Marriage and the Home,
Freshman Discussion, and the Youth
Hostels are only a few of these
groups now being offered by the "Y."
HOLD MEETINGS
The members interested in each of
these special activities hold meetings
either every week or every other
week. Some of the more active "Y"
members who are chairmen of the
group meetings are Betty Augur,
Dorothea Harr, Margaret Brigham,
Norma McKenzie, Ellen Moule, B. J.
Binney, Jeanne Chambers, and Hel
en Severance. The variety of inter
est groups is a great advance over
the opportunities offered when the
"Y" was founded.
