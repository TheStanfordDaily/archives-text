Describing the student life in war
tom Shanghai, Miss Helen Morton
of the World Students' Christian
Association addressed Luncheon
Club yesterday.
Reporting the useful work of the
student association in providing
books, clothing, and medicine, Miss
Morton expressed the wish there
was money enough to install heat
ers, closets, study rooms, and pro
vide current newspapers and books
on foreign affairs which are so sadly
lacking.
Miss Morton was both amazed and
pleased to see the uplifting effect of
the revival of religion among the
students in the Far East who are
surrounded by bombs, suffering,
lack of vital necessities, and a per
sistent fear from attack.
Briefly tracing the history of the
World Students' Christian Associa
tion from its inception in the last
century, an earnest plea was made
for a greater membership and more
funds with which to carry on "this
useful society which is helping to
preserve education and student life
the world over in this modern
crisis."
