## German 'Big Bertha' Guns Blast English Coastal Towns; Senate Amends Presidents British Aid Bill 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 12 (UP). —Wendell L. Willkie, 1040 Kepuhican
Presidential nominee, and Seeretary of the Navy Frank Knox took sharp
issue with each other tonight over whether the United States can safely
release more destroyers to Great Britain without impairing the American
fleet. * 1 —

"We have no more ships to spare
if we want a balanced fleet, "Knox
said at a press conference.
It was the second time in less than
two weeks Knox had raised an em
phatic voice against aiding Britain
"by depleting the fleet."
Willkie, who conferred with Presi
dent Roosevelt last night after urg
ing before the Senate Foreign Re
lations Committee that this country
send Britain from five to ten addi
tional destroyers each month, said
he was "surprised" to read Knox's
statement.
"Information given me by high
authorities in the government," he
told the United Press by long dis
tance telephone from New York,
"after my testimony yesterday con
firmed my views that we are in a
position, without any injury to our
navy or national defense, to give
Great Britain immediate effective
assistance by furnishing to her addi
tional destroyers."
The "high authorities" presum
ably were Mr. Roosevelt, since the
President was the only government
official on whom Willkie called after
his appearance at the committee
hearing. He told the committee
British Prime Minister Winston
Churchill had informed him that
additional destroyers were among
England's three most pressing de
fense needs.
