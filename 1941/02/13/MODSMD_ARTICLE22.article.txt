# A 						Cappella Choir Sings on Series
## 
### 
Combining well trained voices and
the dignity of the Memorial Church,
a concert by the San Jose State Col
lege A Cappella Choir was sung on
the program of the Tuesday Series
1 his week. The choir was directed
by Joseph Running.
The choir's first selection, Tschai
kowsky's "O Blest Are They," ac
centuated the female voices. The
words in this and all other numbers
were exceptionally clear. The out
â–  landing presentation of the evening
was the choir's rendition of "An
Apostrophe to the Heavenly Hosts"
by Willan. The selection featured
exceptional part singing.
Andy Holme took the baritone
solo in Grieg's "How Fair Is Thy
Pace." His voice stood out well in
contrast to the entire ensemble. The
t rogram was confined to religious
selections but had enough light
compositions to provide a pleasing
contrast.

Dosing oneself with vitamin tab
lets is useless, according to physiol
ogists. In the average daily diet it
is impossible to cut out any except
vitamin 81.
