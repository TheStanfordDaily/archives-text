# Bomber Crash Near Lovelock Takes 8 Lives
## Denver-Bound Plane Cracks Up Following Mystery Death Dive 
### 
SACRAMENTO, Feb. 12 (UP).—
A prolonged dive and violent re
covery from 12,(100 feet caused the
crash of a B-17-B Hying fortress and
the death of eight men near Love
lock, Nevada, it was stated here to
night by army ollicials.
The ship crashed on the top of
Ragged Top Mountain Feb. G shortly
after it had taken off from Sacra
mento for Lowry Field, Denver, on
a routine flight. Aboard were eight
officers and men.

Lieutenant Colonel Fred C. Nel
son, commanding McClellan Field
Air Depot, said evidence found by
the official army investigating board
was that the huge four-motored
plane went into a screaming dive
and broke up when recovery was
finally attempted.
OVER 350 M.P.H.
Colonel Nelson said the speed
achieved by the bomber in the dive
could not be estimated, but he put
it as over 350 miles per hour. He
said the investigating board cannot
say what caused the ship to enter
the dive.
Colonel Nelson declared there was
nothing to indicate structural fail
ure, as had been previously reported.
He said the "strongest airplane in
the world" could not withstand the
strain of emerging from such a dive.
ONE OF BEST
"The B-17-B flying fortress," said
Nelson, "is one of the best planes of
its type ever to be used by the army.
It has been flown under all kinds of
conditions, and it is impossible that
there could have been a structural
failure."
Colonel Nelson's statement was
not the full report of the investi
gating board. That report will be
forwarded to Washington for re
lease there.
