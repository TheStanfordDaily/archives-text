### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 12 (UP).
â€” The Administration tonight
again bowed to the opposition
and agreed to accept an amend
ment to President Roosevelt's
British Aid Bill which would
tighten Congressional control over
billions of dollars to be spent un
der the program.
Foes of the bill protested the
measure passed by the House last
week would give the President
"blank check" power to negotiate
contracts without regard to the
amount appropriated by Congress.
The new amendment would limit
these contractual pledges to moneys
appropriated or authorized by the
legislators, thus keeping the purse
strings in their hands.
