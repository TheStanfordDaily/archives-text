# Hoopmen Hep To Torpedo Troy
## Indian Cagers Travel South Today For Two-Game Series Against S.C. 
### 
Heading south for the second time this season, Stanford's league
leading cagers will pull out of the Palo Alto depot at noon today on their
way to a pair of hot contests with U.S.C.'s erstwhile Terrible Trojans.
The Indians, by leaving at noon instead of at night, will lose a Thurs
day practice session in the Pavilion, but at the same time they will have
the advantage of not having to A .

sleep on the train the night before
their first game. The squad, 12
strong, plus the coaches and man
agers, will arrive in Glendale early
this evening.
It will be a peculiar situation the
Indians have to face in the South
land this week-end. If they win,
everyone will just say, "110 hum, I
expected it"; and, while the victory
will mean a lot to Stanford's clinch
ing the southern division crown, the
Indians won't get much credit for it.
WATCII THOSE TROJANS
This will definitely give the Tro
jans a psychological advantage, for
almost anything they do will be bet
ter than what is expected of them.
Those cagers from S.C. just don't
rate for sour apples with hoop fans
this year.
That the Trojans are not a very
high scoring team is shown by Don
Liebendorfer's release on the south
ern division scoring leaders, on
which only one man from Troy, Bob
Ormsby, placed. At that he was in
last place with 43a points scored.
Coach Sam Barry just doesn't seem
to have the boys this season who
can hit the hoop like Ralph Vaughn
could a year ago.
MISS LIPPERT
Captain Jack Lippert was a good
ball player before he was declared
ineligible, but the boy who has
taken his place at guard, Ted Gos
sard, is only fair, having had but
little experience. This is his first
year on the varsity.
Jack Barron, Lenord Berg, and
Johnny Luber make up the rest of
the Trojan first team. When it is
noted that probably not one of these
ihree could crack Ucla, Stanford, or
Cal first teams, it isn't very hard to
understand why the Trojans are tied
for the cellar in the basketball
standings.
FACTORS FAVOR
Despite all the factors in Stan
ford's favor for this week-end's
clashes, there isn't much certainty at
all that the Trojans are going to let
the Indians cop both games—or even
one of the games, for that matter.
Since the Indians are way up at
the top and the Trojans are way
down at the bottom, it seems as
though those cagers from Troy
might recognize the difference in
class by guaranteeing Coach Everett
Dean and his charges two victories
this week-end. It has been a long
time since a U.S.C. hoop team has
been out of first or second place, and
the boys down there don't seem to
like it a bit.
ON SHORT WEEK
In this short week of px-actice —
only three days — Coach Dean has
been sending Williams, Davidson and
Co. through the regular pre-game
workout schedule, featuring practice
on smoothing out the wrinkles in
that already smooth offense, which
has taken Stanford through 18
games with only two losses—those
by one point each.
The 12 players making the trip are
Williams, Anderson, Penn, Dana,
and Linari, forwards; Bumess, Voss,
and Taylor, centers; and Cowden,
Davidson, McCaffrey, and Wensel,
guards.
