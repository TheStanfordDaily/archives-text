# BIG BERTHAS SHOWER ENGLISH COASTAL TOWNS
## 
### 
LONDON, Feb. 12 (UP).â€”Ger
man "Big Bertha" guns today
bombarded an English coastal
town following the Royal Air
Force's relentless night assaults
on an 800-mile stretch of Adolf
Hitler's "invasion front" and his
war centers of Bremen and Hano
ver.
Apparently delivering the first in
stallment of Prime Minister Win
ston Churchill's promise to "drop
three or four tons of bombs on Ger
many for every ton dropped on
Britain," the R.A.F. was maintaining
the destructive pace of its seven
day-old aerial offensive.
