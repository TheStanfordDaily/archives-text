# '44 Scrimmages With J.C. Five
## 
### 
Still going strong after almost a
week's lay-off, the '44 edition of!
j Stanford's frosh hoopmcn out-scrim- i
I maged Menlo J. C. yesterday after- ;
noon in the Pavilion in their last j
practice encounter until the week
end of Feb. 21 and 22, when they
meet Monterey and Lowell high
t schools.
Howard Dallmar, Menlo center,
who will enroll here next Septem
ber, was a standout on defense and
should be a great asset to Everett
Dean's varsity.
Coach Beeb Lee worked his men
in two squads, Jimmy Pollard,
Frank McCann, Dick McDonough,
Dick Middleton, and Bill Hooper
making up- one team, and Fred
Oliver, Dick West, "Bones" Hulstead,
and Bob Wreisner the other.
Both â€¢ Wreisner and McDonough i
looked hot at center and the berth
is still wide open for a starting call j
against Lowell .
Frank McCann, still the coolest
shot on the squad, made his share on
center-in plays from Wreisner and
McDonough. The Jaysees couldn't
master the puzzling offense at all
and the Red forwards got opportu
nities for many more shots than j
usual.
