# Number One Tradition
## 
### 
THERE'S very little anyone can do to enforce
a tradition except to re-state it from time to
time. Campaigns cannot be waged; organiza
tions cannot promote tradition as one would
sell tickets to a dance.
Traditions lose credence if they're bandied
about too much. They can wear thin, like a
silver charm that is discovered to be brass un
derneath. It's easy to make them seem cheap
by continually declaring them lofty.
About fifty years ago Mrs. Stanford requested
that students at the University refrain from
smoking on the Quad and along the cloisters.
For the most part, Stanford men and women
worthy of the name have observed her wishes.
Mrs. Stanford didn't walk around in front of
the Chapel deliberately looking for people who
lit a pipe or a cigar (I guess they didn't have
many cigarettes then) between classes. Oc
casionally, though, people have carelessly
stopped to smoke on the Quad. They haven't
taken the time or effort to walk to the edge.
The number of those who have been casu
ally overlooking an old custom such as this has
been increasing. Today it isn't unusual to see
a group of people between every class smok
ing in Memorial Court or along the Inner Quad
arcades.
Traditions make up the rich heritage of a
university. They color its history and shape
its future. They add a strain of constancy to a
place in which the illusion of youth, as pic
tured in the faces of four thousand undergradu
ates, is particularly strong. And as traditions,
they help to make each succeeding generation
the possessor of a common bond with past and
future classes. They serve a purpose, and they
should not be allowed to slip aawy without
reason.

In war all should sacrifice. When labor
looks at a recent issue of the Wall Street
Journal and notes that profits to stockholders
have increased two, three and even 17 times
in 1940 over 1939; when the laborer finds his
plans disrupted and earnings reduced to $30
a month and keep; when he learns that the
lumber in his cantonment barracks has been
raised in price 517.50 a thousand, and the
ships he serves in are costing the Govern
ment 80 to 90 per cent more than substantially
similar ships did a few years ago, labor and
materials having gone up in the interim less
than a third; when his family at home under
these conditions rightly worries about the
possibility of inflation of a kind that during
the last war created 22,000 millionaires—how
can one dare to demoralize him further by
taking away the social gains he strove so
hard to get, particularly when there exists
ample capacity and men to produce an extra
15 20 billion dollars worth of defense eguip
ment without any necessary increase in costs
or prices, even if wages, hours and bargain
ing rights are fully maintained?—Dr. Theo

hard to get, particularly when there exists
ample capacity and men to produce an extra
15 20 billion dollars worth of defense eguip

THERE'S very little anyone can do to enforce
a tradition except to re-state it from time to
time. Campaigns cannot be waged; organiza
tions cannot promote tradition as one would
sell tickets to a dance.
Traditions lose credence if they're bandied
about too much. They can wear thin, like a
silver charm that is discovered to be brass un
derneath. It's easy to make them seem cheap
by continually declaring them lofty.
About fifty years ago Mrs. Stanford requested
that students at the University refrain from
smoking on the Quad and along the cloisters.
For the most part, Stanford men and women
worthy of the name have observed her wishes.
Mrs. Stanford didn't walk around in front of
the Chapel deliberately looking for people who
lit a pipe or a cigar (I guess they didn't have
many cigarettes then) between classes. Oc
casionally, though, people have carelessly
stopped to smoke on the Quad. They haven't
taken the time or effort to walk to the edge.
The number of those who have been casu
ally overlooking an old custom such as this has
been increasing. Today it isn't unusual to see
a group of people between every class smok
ing in Memorial Court or along the Inner Quad
arcades.
Traditions make up the rich heritage of a
university. They color its history and shape
its future. They add a strain of constancy to a
place in which the illusion of youth, as pic
tured in the faces of four thousand undergradu
ates, is particularly strong. And as traditions,
they help to make each succeeding generation
the possessor of a common bond with past and
future classes. They serve a purpose, and they
should not be allowed to slip aawy without
reason.

In war all should sacrifice. When labor
looks at a recent issue of the Wall Street
Journal and notes that profits to stockholders
have increased two, three and even 17 times
in 1940 over 1939; when the laborer finds his
plans disrupted and earnings reduced to $30
a month and keep; when he learns that the
lumber in his cantonment barracks has been
raised in price 517.50 a thousand, and the
ships he serves in are costing the Govern
ment 80 to 90 per cent more than substantially
similar ships did a few years ago, labor and
materials having gone up in the interim less
than a third; when his family at home under
these conditions rightly worries about the
possibility of inflation of a kind that during
the last war created 22,000 millionaires—how
can one dare to demoralize him further by
taking away the social gains he strove so
hard to get, particularly when there exists
ample capacity and men to produce an extra
15 20 billion dollars worth of defense eguip
ment without any necessary increase in costs
