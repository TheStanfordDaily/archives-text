HOW TO HANDLE A WOMAN
FEW days ago, this column cast a few nasty re
marks out at you readers concerning the virility
of Stanford men. The discussion, those remarks, said
in so many words that the roughs here had lost their
drive, had lost their old finesse, that certain some
thing.
But today it's a different story. Yes, it's a much
happier story. It is a story which should freshen
your faith in the belief that the rough is still pretty
rough.
He still knows how to handle his women. He still
knows how to juggle the feminine hearts in such a
way that even the worst of situations come out all
right in the long run.

so? Well, the substantiating instance in this
case is a story which concerns a little adroit
juggling which took place just a few days ago.
It seems that a certain Stanford male—who we shall
call Man A just to keep this story straight—had a
very heavy date with a sorority woman to take her
to a dance in the city which her house was giving.
Sounds awfully complicated, doesn't it.
At the last minute Man A came down with some
one of the half a dozen diseases running around the
campus today. He couldn't take her to the dance.
So he called up a pal—a REAL pal, who was supposed
to be his friend—and he asked this pal (whom we
shall call Man B) to take his date to the dance.
Man B said okay, and took the six dollars which
Man A gave him to cover those things called "neces
sary expenses." But Man B didn't think the deal was
such a red hot idea. So, after pocketing one of the
dollars, he called up Man C—a pal—and talked him
into taking the sorority woman to that same dance.
Ordinarily you would think that the story had
gone far enough at this point. But, no, that isn't all.
Man C didn't see any bright prospects either. So he
too pocketed one of the dollars—which leaves four—
and called up a pal. They're always pals.
This Man D finally decided to take the gal to her
own house dance . So he pocketed the remaining four
dollars and took the woman to her dance. Inciden
tally—he forgot all about those "necessary incidentals,"
so the four bucks remained right in his warm pocket.

there. Doesn't that restore your faith in the
Stanford rough? Isn't he smooth the way he
handles his woman?
And can't you just feel the spirit of co-operation
that runs through the veins of every rough. Noth
ing's too good for a pal. Of course the money doesn't
mean anything. Not a thing. But it helps. Can't you
just feel that co-operation? In a pinch, there are
always eight or nine guys who will help out.
And can't you see the red, honest blood flowing
through the veins of the rough? Your dollar is al
ways safe with him. And twice as safe with one of
his "pals."
Yes, you need no longer fear for the Stanford
rough. This should restore your faith. Now you can
forget all about that hot water bottle incident.
