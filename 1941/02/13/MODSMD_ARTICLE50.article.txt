## UTOPIA, HERE WE COME 
### 
rpHE EDITOR, SIR:
The great Liberals who have been leading us
toward the greater Utopia for the past eight years
have repeatedly ranted against the proponents of our
system of free enterprise as those who care nothing
for the welfare of the common people, and who would
gladly sacrifice that welfare in order to gain economic
advantage for themselves.
Now, however, we hear a different and strange tunc
from their lips. It seems that our South American
markets are in danger. If that bad, bad man Hitler
beats dear, sweet old England, the first thing he's going
to do is jump down in South America and grab our
markets away from us.
To prevent this, we are to turn our mammoth in
dustrial strength into a great arsenal for the manu
facture of guns, tanks, bombs, gas, shells and all those
other dainty little things that England seems to need
to save Democracy and our South American markets.
Thus our whole nation is going to turn from the
task of sweet, wonderful social reform to the task of
manufacturing weapons with which to kill thousands
of Europeans. Our shells will wreck the homes of
German housewives, our airplanes will roar over the
great Italian cities, our bullets and bayonets will tear
apart the bodies of young Germans and Italians.
This is a rather awful thing to contemplate. Our
nation, founded by the great masses of people who
emigrated from Europe to escape the wars and mili
tarisms of that continent in the hope of finding a
place where they could enjoy peaceful pursuits, is to
be made into nothing more than a supply base for
those same Europeans to carry on those same wars.
And why are we doing all this? Why, to save our
South American markets.
I don't necessarily disagree with this procedure, but
it just seems a little inconsistent to me. For a man
who paints himself as the saviour of the masses from
the economic royalists, President Roosevelt is suddenly
awfully, awfully worried about our losing those all
important South American markets.
But let's not worry about it. As we drop our bombs
on some European home and watch the bodies of its
inhabitants being thrown merrily about by the explo
sion, we'll remember those South American markets.
As we sink our bayonet into the stomach of some
German youth and watch his horrible writhings, we'll
say, "Sorry, pal, but you know how it isâ€”South
American markets . .
And then when it's all over we'll enjoy those South
American markets and think how smart we all were.
But don't be surprised if we find ourselves not so
awfully admired by the.rest of the world.
An Economic Royalist
