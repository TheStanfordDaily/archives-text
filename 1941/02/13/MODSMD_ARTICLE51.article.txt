# FONE FRUSTRATION
## 
### 
EDITOR, SIR:
Did you ever try to phone Lagunita, Roble, or
any of those other places answering—sometimes—to
3121? It can't be done. •
Several days ago I tried to call Jane Jones at
Union. After five minutes of ringing, I got the opera
tor, and in my most clear, pear-shaped tones I pro
nounced Jane Jones three times. No less than ten
minutes later I was connected with Dave Doe, who
was trying to call his roommate's girl in Roble. It's one
way to meet people, but—
Then there is the agonizing, frustrated experience
of hearing that usually taciturn buzzer sound, and
seeing the bobby pin fall off, only to have the gal at
the switchboard say, "I'm sorry; I buzzed ihe wrong
room." Or even worse, "I'm sorry, but I've lost the
call."
I hate to be unreasonable, but can't something be
done about this? After all, a telephone call can be
pretty important—even in winter quarter.
Discouraged
