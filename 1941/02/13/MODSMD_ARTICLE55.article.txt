# Excellent Acting Enlivens Plot of Behrman Comedy
## 
### 
Rarely does a reviewer feel justified in recommending that theater
goers should see a production more than once. Some plays are not worth
it. Others are good enough the f rst time and dreadfully boring the second.
But were one to see "Rain from Heaven" twice it would not only be
permissible ,but would be understandable and add infinite enjoyment to

►the person's appreciation of the play.
This is not meant to hand bou
quets uncritically to the Stanford
players. For the vehicle itself con
tains so many excellent quips and
such thoughtful possibilities that it
is not possible to comprehend them
all in seeing one performance.
But last night's opening perform
ance of S. N. Behrman's Broadway
hit whetted the appetite of the
Stanford audience. If any seat is
left unfilled in the Little Theater for
the remaining three showings, just
as many persons are depriving
themselves of something excellent.
ACTORS PEP
Just as the play did something for
the players, so did the actors put
life into the production that, had it
not been handled right, should have
been very dull and stupid.
Lady Violet Wingate, whose first
name should have instead been
"Pink," was excellently portrayed by
Mizi Hinds. She chattered charm
ingly when the part demanded it
and on occasion was just as success
ful as a serious person or one with
principles.
NO COMMUNIST
Hugo Willens, the German refu
gee, who profoundly exclaims, "I am
a music critic, not a Communist,"
was convincingly played by Ted
Marcuse. Even if his German accent
was a little questionable in parts, his
character never slipped.
Rand Eldridge, Lady Wingate's
first lover and an explorer in his
own right, was well played by Hal
Millen. Deserving special mention is
Adolfo Arias' portrayal of Nikolai
Jurin, a sad, soft-spoken, well-sea
soned refugee. Adolfo caught the
comical lugubriousness of the Rus
sian's character and held it through
ought the production.
Asher Wilson played Hobart Eld
ridge for all that the part of the
intense little nincompoop was worth
and turned in a good performance.
Emily Ruth as Joan Eldridge was
well cast, as was Yvonne Hazlett as
Phoebe Eldridge, the obnoxious
clinging vine.
The rest of the cast, all well chos
en, included Norman Ross as Sascha
Barashaev, Charles Phelps as Clen
don Wyatt, and Joan Wilson as Mrs.
Dingle.

Lady Violet Wingate, whose first
name should have instead been
"Pink," was excellently portrayed by
Mizi Hinds. She chattered charm
ingly when the part demanded it
and on occasion was just as success
ful as a serious person or one with
principles.
NO COMMUNIST
Hugo Willens, the German refu
gee, who profoundly exclaims, "I am
a music critic, not a Communist,"
was convincingly played by Ted
Marcuse. Even if his German accent
was a little questionable in parts, his
character never slipped.
Rand Eldridge, Lady Wingate's
first lover and an explorer in his
own right, was well played by Hal
Millen. Deserving special mention is
Adolfo Arias' portrayal of Nikolai
Jurin, a sad, soft-spoken, well-sea
soned refugee. Adolfo caught the
comical lugubriousness of the Rus
sian's character and held it through
ought the production.
Asher Wilson played Hobart Eld
ridge for all that the part of the
intense little nincompoop was worth
and turned in a good performance.
Emily Ruth as Joan Eldridge was
well cast, as was Yvonne Hazlett as
Phoebe Eldridge, the obnoxious
clinging vine.
The rest of the cast, all well chos
en, included Norman Ross as Sascha
Barashaev, Charles Phelps as Clen
don Wyatt, and Joan Wilson as Mrs.
Dingle.

A Wellington bomber being built
at the Vickers Armstrong factory
will be presented to the British na
tion by the workers.
Rarely does a reviewer feel justified in recommending that theater
goers should see a production more than once. Some plays are not worth
it. Others are good enough the f rst time and dreadfully boring the second.
But were one to see "Rain from Heaven" twice it would not only be
permissible ,but would be understandable and add infinite enjoyment to

►the person's appreciation of the play.
This is not meant to hand bou
quets uncritically to the Stanford
players. For the vehicle itself con
tains so many excellent quips and
such thoughtful possibilities that it
is not possible to comprehend them
all in seeing one performance.
But last night's opening perform
ance of S. N. Behrman's Broadway
hit whetted the appetite of the
Stanford audience. If any seat is
left unfilled in the Little Theater for
the remaining three showings, just
as many persons are depriving
themselves of something excellent.
ACTORS PEP
Just as the play did something for
the players, so did the actors put
life into the production that, had it
not been handled right, should have
been very dull and stupid.
