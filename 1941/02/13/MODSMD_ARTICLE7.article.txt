# Women's Vocom Meet Presents Nine Advisers
## Authorities Outline Views on 'Selecting Major for College' 
### 
Answering the questions of a vol
uble group of freshman and sopho
more women gathered in the Nitcry
last night, nine faculty members
held forth on the subject of select
ing a major, cm the weekly presenta
tion of the Women's Vocational
Committee.
The questions covered almost
every phase of college work, even
including such queries as "What
should you major in if you want to
sell somebody something?" and
"Can a girl take a Strong test?"
Wide interest in biological sciences
was shown and was stimulated par
ticularly by the announcement that
laboratory technicians were in great
demand, especially in army hospi
tals.
Preceding the question and answer
period, Dr. Karl Cowdery, associate
registrar, outlined the role of the
lower division in preparing students
for work in the upper division and
choosing a majoi - .
A LARGER FIELD
He said that after building a
foundation in lower division, stu
dents choose what is designated as a
major, which is simply a larger field
of work in which they do most of
their study, supplemented with
other fields. The lack of a so-called
"minor" requirement at Stanford
was also stressed.
"An A.B. degree should not be
regarded as a job-getter but as a
foundation for entering an occupa
tion with a broad background and
learning it there, or as a basis for
further academic study," Dr. Cow
dery concluded.

foundation for entering an occupa
tion with a broad background and
learning it there, or as a basis for
further academic study," Dr. Cow
dery concluded.
