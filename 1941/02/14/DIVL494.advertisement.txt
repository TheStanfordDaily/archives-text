Early in Stanford's existence it was apparent to
both faculty and students that some organization
was badly needed to distribute books, stationery
and other supplies. To achieve this end the
Leland Stanford junior Cooperative Society was
organized with Elmer Farmer, Frank Entler,
Charles D. Marx, S. J. Brun and B. j. Wiggle as its
directors. The co-op was housed in a little shack
located on the spot where the Machine Shop now
stands.
