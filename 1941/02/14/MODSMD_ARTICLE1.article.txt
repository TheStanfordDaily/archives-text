I>EADERS of the editorial columns
of The Stanford Daily were
asked one morning in February,
1939, to turn to another page of the
paper to a new column called "His
tory . . . 1939" which was to pre
sent a "brief interpretive summary
of world and national affiars." The
writer of the editorial hinted that
those who took the trouble to read
the new column would "come out
sadder and wiser men."
Perhaps, as the present volume of
The Daily comes to a close and as
another "historian" takes over, the
objectives of this column as orig
inally stated in February, 1939, de
serve some reflection.
For three volumes "History"
was to a great extent a column
of news briefs, but at the same
time it became more interpretive.
The character of the news had a
great deal to do with transition.
As a matter of fact, much news
was no more than reported specu
lation by a particular authority or
governmental official.
Of course there has been factual
news —such as a bombing raid over
Britain or the sinking of a British
merchantman.
But what most readers were in
terested in was the significance of
seemingly unimportant events. This
demanded speculation and more in
terpretation.
But "History" expressed opinions,
too, for this is all but inevitable
when one has the task of selecting
material he will use. To leave a
story may be to slant the news.

64JJISTORY" hopes Britain will
defeat Germany in this war.
He hopes at the same time the United
States will not become involved di
rectly. But if it appears Hitler is
about to win, he is willing to serve
in a war on Naziism.
A majority of Stanford students
have expressed this same opinion
and a majority of professors think
likewise.
But why do Americans take this
stand?
"History" believes that regard
less of whether the United States
becomcs involved directly in the
war—either in the Atlantic or the
Pacific—America within 10 or pos
sibly 20 years will be faced with
an internal crisis the like of which
has not yet been seen in this
country. We, then, shall be faced
with the problems that brought
revolutions in Russia, Germany,
and Italy.
Today, unemployment has disap
peared, and in two states taxes are
to be reduced. National income is
more than keeping up with the na
tional debt. We are in the midst of
a stupendous war boom.
And America continues to try to
solve the impending difficulties. The
world when this war is over will be
a different world from the one we
have been accustomed to, and
America's appearance will depend
upon the outcome of the European
war.

JF Germany wins, America must
be an armed camp, must take on
the war economy of a totalitarian
state. To compete with a war econ
omy successfully, a nation must
adopt a war economy.
If Britain wins, America need
not adopt the war economy of the
totalitarian state. Though faced
with an internal economic crisis,
America without an armed enemy
ai,.\>ad might attempt to work out
her problems once more in the
traditional democratic way.
It is the hope of "History" that
America will go further with her
programs of social legislation en
acted for the people by the repre
sentatives of the people — not im
posed upon the people by a self
soleeted minority band of gangsters.
So these are the thoughts that lie
behind the speculations, interpreta
tions, and opinions of "History."
They are "just another man's opin
ions."
Beginning Monday, The Daily will
have a new "Historian." Her views
we shall know by her columns. Her
qualifications are already recognized.
The news today is war; the news
tomorrow will be war. But much of
Stanford slumbers on. For those
who care "History" will have its
place.
