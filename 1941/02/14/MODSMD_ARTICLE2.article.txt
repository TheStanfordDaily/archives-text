# Interfraternity Council Levels Punishment At 'Those Certain Houses'
## Two Fraternities Hit by Action Taken on Violation of Rushing, Off-Campus Party Regulations 
### 
Interfraternity Board of Control last night leveled punitive action
against two fraternities, one "found to have violated an A.S.S.U. regula
tion involving ofT-campus parties," and "a second fraternity found to have
iviolated the rushing rules by having a rushee in the house during the
silent period on Thursday preceding formal pledging."

Names of the houses were
posely withheld because of outside
(Daily) subscription and the San
Francisco papers," Interfraternity
President Pete Whittlesey said last
night.
The statement, released by the
statement committee composed of
Whittlesey, Prof. Harold M. Bacon,
and Bob Prince, Sigma Chi, follows:
"At the meeting of the Interfra
ternity Board of Control last night
in the A.S.S.U. Committee Room,
one fraternity, found to have violated
an A.S.S.U. regulation involving off
campus parties, was fined not less
than $105, the fine to be paid as fol
lows: $3.00 per man to be added to
each house bill payable by each man
living in the house and by all other
active members.
"A second fraternity was found to
have violated the rushing rules by
having a rushee in the house dur
ing the silent period on Thursday
preceding formal pledging. The
privilege of pledging new men was
cancelled for the remainder of the
academic year 1940-1941.
"Attention is called to the fact
that, "The powers of the Interfra
ternity Board of Control are com
plete and unconditional and extend
to all legislative, executive, and dis
ciplinary matters, in connection with
fraternities at Stanford University,
subject only to the approval of the
President of the University."
Another house was punished two
years ago for "Pledge Party," as the
Interfraternity docket read, and as
a result of the action in January,
1939, the house, name of which was
not released, was forced virtually to
withdraw from campus activity for
the remainder of the year.
The entire local chapter was put
on probation, and both past and
present (at that time) house presi
dents, a portion of senior class mem
bers, and individuals responsible for
the affair were forced to sever all
active connections with the local
chapter.
Members of Interfraternity Board
who met last night, besides Whit
tlesey, Prof. Bacon, and Prince, are
Dean of Men John Bunn, Jud Crary,
Bill Weeden, Interfraternity secre
tary, Ed Wearin, co-op president, By
Carlson, Delt president, Neil Bal
lard, D.U. president.
