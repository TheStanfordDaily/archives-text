# Cagers Invade South For Two Trojan Tilts In Last Half Opener
## Cards to Face Psychological Disadvantages 
### DON SELBY 
Starting the second half of the
conference loop as overwhelming fa
vorites to cop the southern division
crown, Stanford's high-flying bas
ketball team invades Los Angeles
tonight to meet the University of
Southern California cagers in the
first game of a two-night stand in
the Shrine Auditorium. The same
two teams meet again tomorrow
night.
Although the clash cannot be rated
as "crucial," because the Indians are
so far out in front that it would
take more than one loss to make
the race close, the two-game series
certainly does have considerable
bearing on the rest of the season's
battle. For a pair of Indian vic
tories would practically assure Wil
liams, Davidson & Co. the southern
division championship without play
ing the rest of the season out, es
pecially if California's Golden Bears
fail to cop both ends of their double
header with the Bruins from
U.C.L.A. at Berkeley this weekend.
READY TO GO
The Stanford cagers arrived in
Los Angeles early yesterday eve
ning and are all in fine fettle arid
ready to go after those two victories.
Besides having to overcome the
psychological disadvantage of being
the favorites, the Indians will have
to defeat another factor tonight,
namely the Shrine Auditorium—a
mammoth place in which the Indian
cagers might easily get lost from
one another.
Although there is no way to
measure the degree of its impor
tance, playing on a strange court be
fore an unfriendly crowd is defi
nitely agreed to be a disadvantage.
And the fans in southern California
are far from friendly to visiting hoop
teams; make no mistake about that.
But, of course, it must be admitted
that southern teams get none too
cheerful a welcome when they visit
Palo Alto or Berkeley.
NOT EASY
When Stanford defeated the Tro
jans in the first half of the four
game series, it was on the Stanford
court. And the Indians didn't have
any too soft a time of it at that. The
Indians copped the first game by a
six-point margin at 43-37, and the
second game by five points at 39-34.
All of which goes to show that
Stanford wasn't so superior to Coach
Sam Barry's lads that the games are
already on ice.- As a matter of fact,
it wouldn't be too surprising to see
the Trojans cop one of the two
games. And the chances are that
Saturday night will be their night
to shine—if they are going to shine
at all.
Outside of their win over thesa
same Trojans in the second game
of the series, Stanford's Indians
haven't defeated a conference op
ponent on Saturday night this sea
son, the only other Saturday night
conference contest they played be
ing their loss to Ucla two weeks ago.
CLASSY LAST YEAR
Most of the wins Coach Dean's
charges have taken on Saturday
night have been over minor oppo
nents, and Dean has used his re
serves almost exclusively. Conse
quently there still isn't any proof
that the Indians can hold out two
nights in a row any better than they
could last season, when they had a
very hard time winning Saturday
night games.
On the other hand, the Trojans
aren't quite the rough-tough-yet
classv outfit that thpv hnnn in
