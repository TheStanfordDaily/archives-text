WOLF OUT
Phil Wolf, another starting chuck

Musanti on the mound with Eddie
Kearse of Newark working behind
the plate. Dalghren, New York
Yankee first sacker, will be at the
initial, Orengo on second, Jennings
at the hot corner, and probably
Lenny Ratto at shortstop.

fielder of the Oakland Acorns, will
take care of left field, Lodigiani will
desert his regular second base posi
tion to play in center, and Arnold
