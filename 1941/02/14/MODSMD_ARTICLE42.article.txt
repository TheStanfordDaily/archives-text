## JERRY BRUCKER, Sports Editor Card Boxers Put 'Em Up With Cal Aggies Tonight 
### 
An experienced Cal Aggies boxing team comes to the Farm tonight to
battle the untried hut strong Stanford Indians at 8 o'clock in the. Pavilion.
Coach Clayton Frye has been working his men since the all-University
and novice tournament over two weeks ago. The Cards have had 110
actual competition since that event, while the Aggies have met and defeated

a good Oregon State outfit.
The heavyweight event will match
Johnny Ward, conqueror of Vic
Lindskog in a close all-University
bout, and Ralph Colin. Colin started
the season strongly with a kayo over
the Beavers' Ken Pruitt. Ward was
considered one of the top heavy
weights of this area for two years,
and since his return to the ring this
year he has once again been estab
lished as a top contender for fistic
honors.
HEWITT MAY FIGHT
If Frank Hewitt has recovered
sufficiently from the bad cold which
has been dogging him all week, he
will fight in the best event of the
night, the 145-pound class, against
the visitors' Elton "Toby" Tobiassen,
present holder of the Pacific Coast
Intercollegiate crown in this divi
sion. Tobiassen won the title as a
freshman, and according to reports
from the north he is better than
ever this year.
COOMBS VS. COOLEY
If the weights released by the Ag
gies are correct, Hal Coombs and
Bronson Cooley will match gloves in
the 120-pound class. Coombs
reached the finals in the P.C.I. event
last year only to be decisioned by
Idaho's Ted Kara, who won the Na
tional 120-pound crown. This es
tablishes Coombs definitely as the
favorite. Cooley lost his event in the
school tourney, but he showed lots
of class, lacking only experience.
Other Aggie ringmen will be
Grant Osborne, Alex Mechnikoff,
Elmer Pahl, Bob Gale, Howard
Briggs, and John Anderson. Tom
McMichael and Jim Thurmond fight
in the 155-pound event, Milt Vedder
in the 165-pound class, and Mel El
lett in the light-heavy division.
