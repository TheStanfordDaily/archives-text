## 
### 
Coach Harry Shipkey's frosh dia
mondmen will meet San Francisco
J. C. this afternooh at 3:30 o'clock
in the first game of their season.
Games were scheduled with Balboa
High and Commerce High earlier
this season but had to be cancelled
because of bad weather.
Starting as backstop will be Ward
Walkup. Sequoia High star. Al
though it is early in the season to
be classing players, he looks like a
fine prospect. Bill Rohm from San
Francisco will act as his relief.
Southpaw Don Pendergrass, a
Portland lad, is the starting hurler
and will, if necessary, be relieved
by Larry Wolfe from Seattle.
At first sack will be Bob Koch,
Papoose grid star. Tex Byrd will
hold the keystone sack and little
Lee Scott will cover the double S
zone. In the hot corner is another
Sequoia High man, Ted Nell. Out
in the daisies will be Bob Mitchell,
Felix Poletti, and Hal Petrich.
Doyle Coldiron and Bill Wilson,
pitchers; Jim Ellis, first; and Harry
Reichling, second, are all ineligible.
If the profs come through in the
pinch this quarter, the squad will be
reinforced with four more good ball
players.
