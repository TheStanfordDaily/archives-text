# Stanford Hopes Rise for O.C. Tilt
## 
### 
With the announcement that their
line-up will be 100 per cent strong
for the Olympic Club tilt tomorrow,
Stanford's hopes for a victory over
the strong Club team took a sharp
turn for the better.
Minus the services of Frankie Al
bert and Pete Kmetovic last Satur
day, Stanford still managed to roll
over the Petaluma Spartans by a
16-0 count, and with the return of
their ace fullback and first five, they
hope to avenge the tie with the Club
in their last encounter.
The preliminary contest between
the Stanford freshmen and Marin
Junior College will start at 2 o'clock,
with the varsity taking to the field
at the close of the Papoose game.
