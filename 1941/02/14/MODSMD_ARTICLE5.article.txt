# Wilton's Essay 'Next 50 Years' Wins Quiz Cash
## Second Prize Money Goes to Ruth Beahrs In 'Stanford' Contest 
### 
Bill Wilton, '44, was yesterday
judged $75 first prize winner in The
Stanford Daily's "Know Stanford"
Contest. In second place was Ruth
Beahrs, graduate student. She will
receive $25.
The first half of the winning es

For the Stanford motto were taken
the words of the German Reforma
tionist, Von Hutton: "Die Luft der
Freiheit Weht," or "The Winds of

great nation save our own is under
political subjugation to one extent
or another, and that this condition
will last, perhaps, for many years
to come.

America is the world's last strong
hold of freedom of thought, and en
terprise. Only with this assumption
clearly in mind may Stanford grow
within its complex surroundings.
Only with constant vigilance and
scrutiny will the words of Von Hut
ton remain a Stanford axiom.
In the past, Stanford has gone
through apparently unsurmountable
obstacles in the fight for its very ex
istence. Through the court strug
