# Wilton's Essay 'Next 50 Years' Wins Quiz Cash
## Second Prize Money Goes to Ruth Beahrs In 'Stanford' Contest 
### 
Bill Wilton, '44, was yesterday
judged $75 first prize winner in The
Stanford Daily's "Know Stanford"
Contest. In second place was Ruth
Beahrs, graduate student. She will
receive $25.
The first half of the winning es
say, titled "Stanford's Next Fifty
Years," follows. The Daily will print
the second half Monday morning.
For the Stanford motto were taken
the words of the German Reforma
tionist, Von Hutton: "Die Luft der
Freiheit Weht," or "The Winds of
Freedom Ai-e Blowing." These
words sound rather ironic today. To
a world filled with war, famine, and
death, there appears to be only a
dark future ahead. Through this
maze of world struggle for power
and suppression of free thought and
will, only the universities and col
leges of America remain as the
world's cultural and technical back
bones.
Through them will pass the genius
of tomorrow, and the leaders of the
future. Therefore, America's edu
cational system will, for the greater
part, largely affect that future of
democracy and free nations. Specif
ically, we must realize that every
great nation save our own is under
political subjugation to one extent
or another, and that this condition
will last, perhaps, for many years
to come.
MAINTAIN THE AXIOM
The outcome of this tragic situa
tion is apparent today; that is,
America is the world's last strong
hold of freedom of thought, and en
terprise. Only with this assumption
clearly in mind may Stanford grow
within its complex surroundings.
Only with constant vigilance and
scrutiny will the words of Von Hut
ton remain a Stanford axiom.
In the past, Stanford has gone
through apparently unsurmountable
obstacles in the fight for its very ex
istence. Through the court strug
gles, through tragic 1906, and
thrmicrta tho arnui war ifc on
suing depresison it grew, each time
stronger, each time better able to
solve its own problems.
Gratefully endowed and loyally
supported, it continuously developed
and expanded to meet those needs
which manifested themselves. Tra
ditions and precedents of various
kinds and scope were firmly estab
lished; each sane and each modified
to be becoming to a Stanford stu
dent. The Stanfords' dream of a
great university and memorial was
fulfilled, and the school's role in na
tional and civic affairs became in
creasingly apparent as the years
went on.
STANFORD AT PRESENT
For the present, Stanford remains
the outstanding and proven coedu
cational system that it is. It has
ret .ained flexible in structure, and
holds a natural appeal and charm
of international renown. On this 50th
anniversary, Stanford stands oh a
reputation as solid as it is convinc
ing; a reputation built only from
constant work, enterprise, and per
severing guidance. From looking at
the brilliant, almost remarkable
developments and achievements of
the past, we look wonderingly at
the future.
Any attempt to predict or even
analyze the subsequent years in
terms of world events is hopelessly
futile, but any attempt, or attempts
to modify Stanford's pattern of
teaching so as to fit into a scheme of
thinking, a way of material and
evident trends, is surely a step
toward the added integrity and se
curity of this institution.
New fields, new courses, and var
ious added requirements will surely
be undertaken in the future, as they
have in the past.
These may be temporal, or perma
nent, depending upon the best in
terests of the student alone. No
matter what they may be, however,
they must follow at least two defi
nite criteria which thus far have
demonstrated themselves. First,
they must have a need and demand
not only of the student but of the
average college graduate who re
alizes those needs as he sees them,
Second, they must be taught in re-*
lationship to the outside world and
be so molded as to fit distinct trends.
They must follow those particular
trends which seem vital and omni-'
present at that singular time, but

above all, they must make the stu
dent see himself in the world as an
active participant in the complex
economic, political, and social life
going on about him. Mere specta
tors with only receptive abilities
and points of view, with only plans
and ideologies, will be of little con
sequence. Also, there is the ever
increasing responsibility of the citi
zen to follow the daily happenings
and events, and a consequential
need of people with the ability to
analyze critically and wisely.

Bill Wilton, '44, was yesterday
judged $75 first prize winner in The
Stanford Daily's "Know Stanford"
Contest. In second place was Ruth
Beahrs, graduate student. She will
receive $25.
The first half of the winning es
say, titled "Stanford's Next Fifty
Years," follows. The Daily will print
the second half Monday morning.
For the Stanford motto were taken
the words of the German Reforma
tionist, Von Hutton: "Die Luft der
Freiheit Weht," or "The Winds of
Freedom Ai-e Blowing." These
words sound rather ironic today. To
a world filled with war, famine, and
death, there appears to be only a
dark future ahead. Through this
maze of world struggle for power
and suppression of free thought and
will, only the universities and col
leges of America remain as the
world's cultural and technical back
bones.
Through them will pass the genius
of tomorrow, and the leaders of the
future. Therefore, America's edu
cational system will, for the greater
part, largely affect that future of
democracy and free nations. Specif
ically, we must realize that every
great nation save our own is under
political subjugation to one extent
or another, and that this condition
will last, perhaps, for many years
to come.
MAINTAIN THE AXIOM
The outcome of this tragic situa
tion is apparent today; that is,
America is the world's last strong
hold of freedom of thought, and en
terprise. Only with this assumption
clearly in mind may Stanford grow
within its complex surroundings.
Only with constant vigilance and
scrutiny will the words of Von Hut
ton remain a Stanford axiom.
In the past, Stanford has gone
through apparently unsurmountable
obstacles in the fight for its very ex
istence. Through the court strug
gles, through tragic 1906, and
thrmicrta tho arnui war ifc on
suing depresison it grew, each time
stronger, each time better able to
solve its own problems.
Gratefully endowed and loyally
supported, it continuously developed
and expanded to meet those needs
which manifested themselves. Tra
ditions and precedents of various
kinds and scope were firmly estab
lished; each sane and each modified
to be becoming to a Stanford stu
dent. The Stanfords' dream of a
great university and memorial was
fulfilled, and the school's role in na
tional and civic affairs became in
creasingly apparent as the years
went on.
STANFORD AT PRESENT
For the present, Stanford remains
the outstanding and proven coedu
cational system that it is. It has
ret .ained flexible in structure, and
holds a natural appeal and charm
of international renown. On this 50th
anniversary, Stanford stands oh a
reputation as solid as it is convinc
ing; a reputation built only from
constant work, enterprise, and per
severing guidance. From looking at
the brilliant, almost remarkable
developments and achievements of
the past, we look wonderingly at
the future.
Any attempt to predict or even
analyze the subsequent years in
terms of world events is hopelessly
futile, but any attempt, or attempts
to modify Stanford's pattern of
teaching so as to fit into a scheme of
thinking, a way of material and
evident trends, is surely a step
toward the added integrity and se
curity of this institution.
New fields, new courses, and var
ious added requirements will surely
be undertaken in the future, as they
have in the past.
These may be temporal, or perma
nent, depending upon the best in
terests of the student alone. No
matter what they may be, however,
they must follow at least two defi
nite criteria which thus far have
demonstrated themselves. First,
they must have a need and demand
not only of the student but of the
average college graduate who re
alizes those needs as he sees them,
Second, they must be taught in re-*
lationship to the outside world and
be so molded as to fit distinct trends.
They must follow those particular
trends which seem vital and omni-'
present at that singular time, but

above all, they must make the stu
dent see himself in the world as an
active participant in the complex
economic, political, and social life
going on about him. Mere specta
tors with only receptive abilities
and points of view, with only plans
and ideologies, will be of little con
sequence. Also, there is the ever
increasing responsibility of the citi
zen to follow the daily happenings
and events, and a consequential

tors with only receptive abilities
and points of view, with only plans

increasing responsibility of the citi

and events, and a consequential
need of people with the ability to
analyze critically and wisely.
Bill Wilton, '44, was yesterday
judged $75 first prize winner in The
Stanford Daily's "Know Stanford"
Contest. In second place was Ruth
Beahrs, graduate student. She will
receive $25.
The first half of the winning es
say, titled "Stanford's Next Fifty
Years," follows. The Daily will print
the second half Monday morning.
For the Stanford motto were taken
the words of the German Reforma
tionist, Von Hutton: "Die Luft der
Freiheit Weht," or "The Winds of
Freedom Ai-e Blowing." These
words sound rather ironic today. To
a world filled with war, famine, and
death, there appears to be only a
dark future ahead. Through this
maze of world struggle for power
and suppression of free thought and
will, only the universities and col
leges of America remain as the
world's cultural and technical back
bones.
Through them will pass the genius
of tomorrow, and the leaders of the
future. Therefore, America's edu
cational system will, for the greater
part, largely affect that future of
democracy and free nations. Specif
ically, we must realize that every
great nation save our own is under
political subjugation to one extent
or another, and that this condition
will last, perhaps, for many years
to come.
MAINTAIN THE AXIOM
The outcome of this tragic situa
tion is apparent today; that is,
America is the world's last strong
hold of freedom of thought, and en
terprise. Only with this assumption
clearly in mind may Stanford grow
within its complex surroundings.
Only with constant vigilance and
scrutiny will the words of Von Hut
ton remain a Stanford axiom.
In the past, Stanford has gone
through apparently unsurmountable
obstacles in the fight for its very ex
istence. Through the court strug
gles, through tragic 1906, and
thrmicrta tho arnui war ifc on
suing depresison it grew, each time
stronger, each time better able to
solve its own problems.
Gratefully endowed and loyally
supported, it continuously developed
and expanded to meet those needs
which manifested themselves. Tra
ditions and precedents of various
kinds and scope were firmly estab
lished; each sane and each modified
to be becoming to a Stanford stu
dent. The Stanfords' dream of a
great university and memorial was
fulfilled, and the school's role in na
tional and civic affairs became in
creasingly apparent as the years
went on.
STANFORD AT PRESENT
For the present, Stanford remains
the outstanding and proven coedu
cational system that it is. It has
ret .ained flexible in structure, and
holds a natural appeal and charm
of international renown. On this 50th
anniversary, Stanford stands oh a
reputation as solid as it is convinc
ing; a reputation built only from
constant work, enterprise, and per
severing guidance. From looking at
the brilliant, almost remarkable
developments and achievements of
the past, we look wonderingly at
the future.
Any attempt to predict or even
analyze the subsequent years in
terms of world events is hopelessly
futile, but any attempt, or attempts
to modify Stanford's pattern of
teaching so as to fit into a scheme of
thinking, a way of material and
evident trends, is surely a step
toward the added integrity and se
curity of this institution.
New fields, new courses, and var
ious added requirements will surely
be undertaken in the future, as they
have in the past.
These may be temporal, or perma
nent, depending upon the best in
terests of the student alone. No
matter what they may be, however,
they must follow at least two defi
nite criteria which thus far have
demonstrated themselves. First,
they must have a need and demand
not only of the student but of the
average college graduate who re
alizes those needs as he sees them,
Second, they must be taught in re-*
lationship to the outside world and
be so molded as to fit distinct trends.
They must follow those particular
trends which seem vital and omni-'
present at that singular time, but

above all, they must make the stu
dent see himself in the world as an
active participant in the complex
economic, political, and social life
going on about him. Mere specta
tors with only receptive abilities
and points of view, with only plans
and ideologies, will be of little con
sequence. Also, there is the ever
increasing responsibility of the citi
zen to follow the daily happenings
