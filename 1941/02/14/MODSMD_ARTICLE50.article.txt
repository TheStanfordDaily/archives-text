### JERRY BRUCKER 
JT seems like just about the day
i before yesterday that we stepped
! into this job and started trying to
! keep up with the athletic life of
i the Farm. Yet now we find that the
end of Volume 98 is here, and the
time has come for us to move along
and make room for the new Sports
Editor.
With two and a half years' expe
rience on The Daily sports staff be
hind him to provide the necessary
background, Chuck Smith is well
qualified to take over the job he is
stepping into. To add to the knowl
edge of the journalistic angle of
sports he has picked up while writ
ing vaisity track and football, Chuck
has two years of experience on
Coach Everett Dean's Indian hoop
squad.
I lis better known work during
the last volume was keeping the
campus informed of the inside go
ings on of Clark Shaughnessy's
undefeated gridmen. We would
like to thank him now for helping
us out in a capacity for which he
has received little or no credit, as
Assistant Sports Editor.

i before turning the depart
ment over to Chuck we want to
thank the people who make a sports
page possible, the men who write
about the various sports, for the
swell jobs they've done.
DON SELBY. covering frosh foot
ball and varsity basketball, has
probably turned out more copy than
anyone on The Daily this volume.
The chances are good that Don will
take over this job some day, for
there isn't a better sports writer on
the staff.
Two men who wrote sports fall
quarter but are unable to take beats
this quarter because of outside ac
tivities are CIIESLEY SAROYAN
and lIAP EVERETT. Ches chron
icled the doings of Harry Maloney's
scccermen, while Hap reported the
ups and downs of the cross country
team.
JOHN HORRALL is another of
the regular writers who has done
line, conscientious work. He han
dled the tough intramural beat last
fall, and is now following the fistic
fortunes of the Card boxers.
4 The most efficient of the relatively
new members of the staff have been
808 SONTAG and 808 CHAND
LER. Sontag is doing double duty
now, covering both frosh basketball
and varsity baseball, and doing a
swell job on both. Chandler, in addi
tion to writing rugby and water polo,
has taken a crack at about every
other sport there is. Whenever some
thing unnexpected came up Bob was
the boy on the spot to take care
of it.
BUD CLARY is just breaking in
on the sports staff now writing ten
nis, but he should go a long way
when he learns the ropes.
Two of the most promising young
sters on the staff are FERRIS
BOOTH, currently writing intra
murals, and 808 HANNAH, cover
ing swimming.
Besides these boys we got a lot of
help from 11. I). THOREAU, rele
gated to the sidelines this quarter by
appendicitis, 808 REYNOLDS,
BILL STEIF, BILL COLGIILIN.
and probably a lot more whose
names have slipped out of the era
of the old grey matter.

A ND before stepping out, Chuck, i
there's one favor we'd like to !

ask. We haven't carried on many
crusades in Slants this volume, but
there's one thing we'd sort of like
to see come to pass. Please ride the
B.A.C. until they hire a coach for
the tennis squad.
And before we forget, thanks to
the undefeated Indians and Coach
Dean's casaba crew. They provided
us with what every sports reporter
hopes and prays for, winning teams
to write about. That made it awful
easy.
So that's all there is, Chuck.
Thanks again for what's gone by,
and the very best of luck to you
in your new job, it's a swell one.

JT seems like just about the day
i before yesterday that we stepped
! into this job and started trying to
! keep up with the athletic life of
i the Farm. Yet now we find that the
end of Volume 98 is here, and the
time has come for us to move along
and make room for the new Sports
Editor.
With two and a half years' expe
rience on The Daily sports staff be
hind him to provide the necessary
background, Chuck Smith is well
qualified to take over the job he is
stepping into. To add to the knowl
edge of the journalistic angle of
sports he has picked up while writ
ing vaisity track and football, Chuck
has two years of experience on
Coach Everett Dean's Indian hoop
squad.
I lis better known work during
the last volume was keeping the
campus informed of the inside go
ings on of Clark Shaughnessy's
undefeated gridmen. We would
like to thank him now for helping
us out in a capacity for which he
has received little or no credit, as
Assistant Sports Editor.

i before turning the depart
ment over to Chuck we want to
thank the people who make a sports
page possible, the men who write
about the various sports, for the
swell jobs they've done.
DON SELBY. covering frosh foot
ball and varsity basketball, has
probably turned out more copy than
anyone on The Daily this volume.
The chances are good that Don will
take over this job some day, for
there isn't a better sports writer on
the staff.
Two men who wrote sports fall
quarter but are unable to take beats
this quarter because of outside ac
tivities are CIIESLEY SAROYAN
and lIAP EVERETT. Ches chron
icled the doings of Harry Maloney's
scccermen, while Hap reported the
ups and downs of the cross country
team.
JOHN HORRALL is another of
the regular writers who has done
line, conscientious work. He han
dled the tough intramural beat last
fall, and is now following the fistic
fortunes of the Card boxers.
4 The most efficient of the relatively
new members of the staff have been
808 SONTAG and 808 CHAND
LER. Sontag is doing double duty
now, covering both frosh basketball
and varsity baseball, and doing a
swell job on both. Chandler, in addi
tion to writing rugby and water polo,
has taken a crack at about every
other sport there is. Whenever some
thing unnexpected came up Bob was
the boy on the spot to take care
of it.
BUD CLARY is just breaking in
on the sports staff now writing ten
nis, but he should go a long way
when he learns the ropes.
Two of the most promising young
sters on the staff are FERRIS
BOOTH, currently writing intra
murals, and 808 HANNAH, cover
ing swimming.
Besides these boys we got a lot of
help from 11. I). THOREAU, rele
gated to the sidelines this quarter by
appendicitis, 808 REYNOLDS,
BILL STEIF, BILL COLGIILIN.
and probably a lot more whose
names have slipped out of the era
of the old grey matter.

A ND before stepping out, Chuck, i
there's one favor we'd like to !

ask. We haven't carried on many
crusades in Slants this volume, but
there's one thing we'd sort of like
to see come to pass. Please ride the
B.A.C. until they hire a coach for
the tennis squad.
And before we forget, thanks to
the undefeated Indians and Coach
Dean's casaba crew. They provided
us with what every sports reporter
hopes and prays for, winning teams
to write about. That made it awful
easy.
So that's all there is, Chuck.

in your new job, it's a swell one.
JT seems like just about the day
i before yesterday that we stepped
! into this job and started trying to
! keep up with the athletic life of
i the Farm. Yet now we find that the
end of Volume 98 is here, and the
time has come for us to move along
and make room for the new Sports
Editor.
With two and a half years' expe
rience on The Daily sports staff be
hind him to provide the necessary
background, Chuck Smith is well
qualified to take over the job he is
stepping into. To add to the knowl
edge of the journalistic angle of
sports he has picked up while writ
ing vaisity track and football, Chuck
has two years of experience on
Coach Everett Dean's Indian hoop
squad.
I lis better known work during
the last volume was keeping the
campus informed of the inside go
ings on of Clark Shaughnessy's
undefeated gridmen. We would
like to thank him now for helping
us out in a capacity for which he
has received little or no credit, as
Assistant Sports Editor.

i before turning the depart
ment over to Chuck we want to
thank the people who make a sports
page possible, the men who write
about the various sports, for the
swell jobs they've done.
DON SELBY. covering frosh foot
ball and varsity basketball, has
probably turned out more copy than
anyone on The Daily this volume.
The chances are good that Don will
take over this job some day, for
there isn't a better sports writer on
the staff.
Two men who wrote sports fall
quarter but are unable to take beats
this quarter because of outside ac
tivities are CIIESLEY SAROYAN
and lIAP EVERETT. Ches chron
icled the doings of Harry Maloney's
scccermen, while Hap reported the
ups and downs of the cross country
team.
JOHN HORRALL is another of
the regular writers who has done
line, conscientious work. He han
dled the tough intramural beat last
fall, and is now following the fistic
fortunes of the Card boxers.
4 The most efficient of the relatively
new members of the staff have been
808 SONTAG and 808 CHAND
LER. Sontag is doing double duty
now, covering both frosh basketball
and varsity baseball, and doing a
swell job on both. Chandler, in addi
tion to writing rugby and water polo,
has taken a crack at about every
other sport there is. Whenever some
thing unnexpected came up Bob was
the boy on the spot to take care
of it.
BUD CLARY is just breaking in
on the sports staff now writing ten
nis, but he should go a long way
when he learns the ropes.
Two of the most promising young
sters on the staff are FERRIS
BOOTH, currently writing intra
murals, and 808 HANNAH, cover
ing swimming.
Besides these boys we got a lot of
help from 11. I). THOREAU, rele
gated to the sidelines this quarter by
appendicitis, 808 REYNOLDS,
BILL STEIF, BILL COLGIILIN.
and probably a lot more whose
names have slipped out of the era
of the old grey matter.

A ND before stepping out, Chuck, i
there's one favor we'd like to !

ask. We haven't carried on many
crusades in Slants this volume, but
there's one thing we'd sort of like
to see come to pass. Please ride the
B.A.C. until they hire a coach for
the tennis squad.
And before we forget, thanks to
the undefeated Indians and Coach
Dean's casaba crew. They provided
us with what every sports reporter
hopes and prays for, winning teams
to write about. That made it awful
easy.
So that's all there is, Chuck.
Thanks again for what's gone by,
and the very best of luck to you
in your new job, it's a swell one.
