# Dear Willy:

Sitting in the editor's chair and pushing the
Underwood around on the little green ..ble for
the last time tonight has induced a strange type
of panic. I'm faced with the task of giving a
final, loving pat to old 98 before it draws its
covers around it and retires to a dusty library
shelf. And I must deliver 99 into your hands,
new and unmarred.
This spectacle of life and death has left me
both inarticulate and awed.
People cluster around retiring officials just
as they do about dying men. Somehow they
accord their last few words some signicance.
Why that should be, I can't say. You see, I
won't be able to tell you much about Stanford
or The Daily that you don't already know.
* ★ * *
To the outside world, Stanford is coolly aloof.
With arched eyebrow, it looks down its nose at
mortals who pass its gates. And at the end of
Palm Drive there's a big sign, "World, Stay
Away." To those inside, though, "the Stanford
Family" isn't just a neat phrase.
This year that "ivory tower" has been rocked
a bit. Men are leaving the Farm for service in
the armed forces of the nation. The sound of in
cessant bombings in Europe and the distant
rumble of thunder from the war clouds of Asia
have beaten at the window panes. Even college
undergraduates cannot overlook such things.
That's why, Willy, you may be sitting in the
driver's seat with America turning down a road
she traveled twenty years ago—a road marked
clearly in the red letters of war.

Four months' stint here in the front office
have strengthened some beliefs and under
mined others. I am even more convinced than
ever that democracy is the best government a
nation can have. I am more frightened than ever
of the threat of fascism, far greater from within
this nation than from without. I am still con
vinced that free discussion of ideas is essential
for the preservation of liberties. I believe that
such free discussion is vanishing rapidly from
the street-corner. Maybe a university is the only
place it can exist —and it has taken a bad beat
ing in some of the nation's most enlightened in
stitutions. If you do nothing else, fight for the
chance of all men to discuss freely.
You know The Daily well enough to under
stand its position on campus. During the
next volume you will, at various times, think
it (1) a bulletin board, and (2) the only voice
that can speak for student reforms. In a sense,
both of these ideas are true. The Daily is a
house organ for the Associated Students, and
for the University, and it is the only means of
protesting faults and urging changes.
One of these aims is utilitarian and the other,
noble. Yet they can be reconciled. You will have
ten phone calls of blame for an ommission in
the Bulletin Board; one phone call of praise for
an editorial stand.
You know, too, Willy, that this editorship
proposition looks outward in one direction and
inward in another. Half your time will be spent
keeping the internal organization of The Daily
clicking along smoothly. And the other half
will be spent oiling the campus channel that
The Daily will follow. You're fortunate to have
such people as Janny Gould sticking up the
assignment sheet; Bud Ames and Charlie Bull
turning out the editorials and helping with U.P.,
and Marge Hovey looking after the tryoutees.
And you're the man, Wils, to keep that other
side of things under control—because you
know Stanford, and Stanford likes you.
Since that hot day last September a couple
of weeks before school opened, when twenty
people came back to the Shack to manufacture
a Pre-Registration issue, I've never forgotten
how lucky I've been to work with such a crew.
1 could name them all—"Scoot Hislop," with
whom I've never disagreed on any major pub
lication problem; you and Jerry, who have never
failed to go to bat when work had to be done;
Mary Etta Farrell, my idea of a perfect woman's
editor, one who could treat all frosh with smil
ing ease and pound out an intelligent, beauti
fully-handled editorial.
I'd like to thank those night editors—Charley
and Bat say they're the best crop The Daily
has ever had—for being tolerant of late edi
torials and for fashioning a readable paper, five
days a week, and week after week.
I could go on like this —and say thanks to
Jean Nowell for fine features coverage, and for
worrying with me about "Know Stanford" so
valiantly; to Romie Mullany for being Romie,
and for shouldering a very dull job; to Bob Low,
who wrote "History" with more insight and in
telligence than any Daily columnist before him;
to Audrey, and Vic, Brady, Brucker, Ches, Amie,
to Shaf, and to Ted "Lubitsch" Reed.
TheyVe all boen Volume 98. It was the staff's
paper and not mine.

And, incidentally, Will—watch out for that
editor's chair. It has a cushion; it's a swivel
chair, too. In fact, it looks damned impressive.
If you lean back too far, though, it'll throw you.
I've always thought maybe there was something
symbolic about that.
