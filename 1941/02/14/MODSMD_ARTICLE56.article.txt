# BULL SESSION

### BUD AMES 
OBITUARY NOTICE
IT'S BEEN a long time, hasn't it? A lot of water
has passed over this typewriter since way back
last fall. A lot of good-natured, and a lot of rather
serious campaigns have been waged in this column over
these past weeks.
And now it's over.
For today ends it all. Somebody else is moving in
to take over this column. Monday The Daily begins a
new volume. Monday a new, a freshly washed face
will be shining at you out of the words of this column.
Tuesday that face will be muddy.
Monday morning, beginning new,
Another sap will Bull for you.
Another man will pile this grut,
With high ideals and mind off smut
Perhaps he can stay out of my rut.

corny poetry, but when it comes to winding up
this column, it is just as well to go out in a blast
of the usual corn that has been going on for the past
many weeks.
All kidding aside though, writing this column of a
few laughs and a few more boos has been great fun.
It was hard telling exactly what you wanted to hear.
Did you want campaigns with your coffee? Or did
you want a snicker with your snail?
We weren't certain. So we mixed them up. But
always there has been but one goal in view—to bring
you a column which reflects the thoughts and the in
terests of the campus. And the campus is you.
One Campus Opinion letter writer wrote a note to
the Daily about a week ago regarding this column. In
so many vitriolic words he said that this volume's
Bull Session was just another campus opinion.
That writer meant it in a rather nasty way. But
actually, without his realizing it, he was paying a
compliment. He had said what we had always hoped
to hear. This is a campus opinion column. It should
always be your column. So, to that irate letter writer,
we say thanks.

HPHANK you, too. Thank you, every one of you The
scarcity of your complaining letters has indicated
that you have not found too much of fault in the lines
of this column from day to day.
And now, goodbye. For me, it's off to the cellar
for a coke with spots in the bottom, for a cheese
sandwich with a slug in it, for one of those Union
meals that we've been hearing so much about.
The obituary notice has been printed. You'll find
it above.
The tombstone has been laid. You'll find it below.
