# CAMPUS OPINION
## CONCERT CULTURE 
### 
TPHE EDITOR, SIR:
This column usually carries so much deprecatory
material from rabble-rousers and wild-hairs who find
no other means of expression, I should like to submit
a favorable opinion drawn upon the announcement of
the all-University "Pop" Concert March 2.
That this is the first time such an undertaking has
ever been conducted by any symphony orchestra in
the United States, and that the popular program prom
ises to feature selections that the average student,
not accustomed to symphony-going, can appreciate,
is a favorable commentary on undergraduate taste.
Pierre Monteux. who will conduct the San Fran
cisco Symphony Orchestra in the evening's presenta
tion, is well known in music cii-cles as one who has
introduced many modern works, particularly French,
to American listeners.
Many of the Row and Hall men are taking advan
tage of the occasion to "date the queen," and several
pre-symphony dinner parties in the city and the East
Bay area are planned.
All this enthusiasm adds up to the obvious con
clusion that Stanford students are actually interested
in something really worth while, instead of the usual
night of city dancing or trip down the highway, and
I for one hope their cultural appetite will be further
cultivated in the future.
