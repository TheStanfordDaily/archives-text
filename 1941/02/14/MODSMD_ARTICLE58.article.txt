# BULL SESSIONUM LITERATUM
## 
### 
r PHE EDITOR, SIR:
The other day some students were sitting around
in the Women's Clubhouse waiting for something or
other to happen when the question of a literary maga
zine for the campus came up. Among the group was
a member of the Chaparral editorial board, a Daily
man or two, the president of Writers Club, and the edi
tor of the Yearbook of Stanford Writing, soon to be
issued.
And they didn't like the idea of a Jiterary magazine,
of the kind described. They didrf't like it a bit, and
here are a few reasons.
Begin by discounting professional jealousy. Al
though this small group of students represented a
good share of the literary and journalistic power on
campus, it has nothing to gain by squelching outright
any new magazine that is raising its young head. The
new venture would in no way cross the path of The
Daily; it is completely out of the Chappie's ken, and
the Yearbook is a contest affair issued once a year,
and with more than enough material to fill its pages.
The point is, in the opinion of this group of pretty
hard-boiled amateurs, the magazine wouldn't work
because it wouldn't—as outlined by its spokesman—
be representative, in material or appeal to the campus
at large.
The idea, the man said, was to give the unpublished
writers a chance, give the people who missed out on
the Yearbook the fun of seeing themselves in print.
Asked if he thought it would sell, or support itself
by its ads, the spokesman declared, "It would be of
interest to a certain class of students, the ones who
care to see student writing advanced."
That, it seemed to a majority of those present, was
entirely too small and too hard-shelled a unit, if it
was comprised of a group outside of those in the old
English Club, the present Writers Club, and all fac
ulty members who give their evenings and a good
share of personal attention to any Stanford person
who "wants to write," as well as the literary hangers
on who contribute straight stuff to Chappie and have
a drawer full of things they're "going to do some
thing with some day."
If the new magazine is going to cater to some exotic
bunch on campus that can't find a way to get pub
lished through the regular channels, plans to write
by itself for itself, and thinks the people who were
unappreciative the other night are merely jealous and
too commercial-minded, then it is perhaps an added
indication that its ideas aren't too well in hand.
