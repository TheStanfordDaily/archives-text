# History ... 1941

### Jean Nowell 
tMVE days a week from 3 o'clock
till midnight, The Daily's clat
tering teletypes hammer out line on
line of information concerning the
news of the day. These machines
playing an omnipresent counter
point to the activities of every man
and woman on the sin ft, are the
real writers of "History . . . 1941."
Some of the material on the long
rolls of yellow paper is trivia—such
was the story of Laddie, the dog who
died of loneliness for his master.
But unimportant though Laddie
mey have been, he was part of the
fabric of events from which human
aHairs are woven.
"History" in Volume 99 will not
deal with the Laddies of the
world; because it feels that the
teletypes have more important
things to say. Laddie was of vital
interest to very few of us; and in
this column we shall attempt to
cover the events which may affect
the lives of many men and women
—particularly the men and women
of the Stanford community.
The writer of this column makes
no claim to infallibility, and she asks
you to remember one of Bob Low's
parting remarks last Friday—that
this column is "just another man's
opinion." As a dealer in opinions
based on the teletype's careful, un
colored facts, Mr. Low set a stand
ard difficult to approach. That our
opinions from time to time will dif
fer from Mr. Low's and from yours
is to be expected. The writer is not
Herr Hitler . . . and neither are you.

jyjß. HENRY FORD is an inter
esting sort of person because he
made a couple of million dollars in
the automobile business and because
he sometimes suffers (out loud) from
the delusion that he is God, or if
not God at least His visible provi
dence.
There is a certain charm in the
little notes he delivered to his
workers back in 1937, when his
men were going union right and
left. Among other things it cen
lained the item:
"Our men ought to consider
whether it is necessary to pay some
outsider every month for the priv
ilege of working at Ford's."
Lp ,t Saturday the man with the
"privilege" of being head of the
gigantic Ford concern came out
with a few opinions worthy of note.
M \ Henry Ford thinks that the
I lited States should give England
d the Axis powers "the tools to
iep on fighting till they both col-
J. pse."

M"R. HENRY FORD "sincerely
hopes" they will both collapse
because "there is no righteousness
in either cause . . . both are mo
tivated by the same evil impulse
which is greed."
Now there are varying degrees
of "greed" in the world, and it is
certain that the ideological aspect
of Europe's conflict is only one of
many facets in the situation. Cer
tainly the problem is complex, and
you might say, with little chance of
being wrong, that Great Britain is
greedy to maintain her empire,
her sovereignty, and her way of
life; and that Germany is no less
greedy to juggle several status
quos.
Mr. Henry Ford goes on:
"It is not the little people who
are doing the fighting and the suf
fering who are the greedy ones . . .
Their only guilt is idleness . . . and
the idleness has made them stupid
. . . and so the big ones, the greedy
ones, have led them into war."

A s a spokesman for the "little
people," the 77-year-old mag
nate has an interesting role. Again
he is probably right when he says
that the war is not their fault But
it is interesting to speculate on his
use of the word "idleness."
We wonder if the "little people"
who are so stupid yearned to be idle
during the Great Depression; if they
were anxious to stand in bread lines,
or go on the dole.
Mr. Henry Ford thinks that both
sides should fight till they are flat
on their backs, and that the United
States should then step in and dic
tate the peace. But with all those
"tools," Mr. Henry Ford, are you
so sure there would be any of your
little people left?
