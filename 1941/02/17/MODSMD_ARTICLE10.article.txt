# Chalmers Delivers Sunday's Sermon
## 
### 
Dr. Allen Knight Chalmers, from
the Broadway Tabernacle in New
York City, delivered yesterday's
sermon at It o'clock in the Stanford
Memorial Chapel. The topic of his
discussion was "How Do You Tell
a Person Is a Christian?"
With his stirring personality, Dr.
Chalmers gave examples of various
traits which might comprise a true
Christian, such as "a man who keeps
going when he's hit."
