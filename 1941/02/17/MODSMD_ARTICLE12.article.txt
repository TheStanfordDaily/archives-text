# Ace Daily Reporter Finds Way Through Underpass
## 
### VIC MINAHAN 
In the interests of those Stanford students who are interested in becom
ing amateur Stanleys and Livingstones, The Daily publishes today a few
simple rules for Going Through the Underpasses:
1. Going cast on Palm Drive, to turn left toward San Francisco. Go
over the El Camino underpass and stop where the center island breaks,

kbelore going under the railroad un
derpass. This is an arterial stop.
After waiting an hour or so for a
chance to cross the north half of the
road, you turn into the northeast
connecting road, which leads you
onto El Camino.
LEFT TO SAN JOSE
2. Going west on University, to
turn left toward San Jose. Go all
the way through both underpasses,
and turn left where Palm Drive
theoretically begins, using the
southwest connecting road. This is
also an arterial stop.
3. Going south on El Camino, to
1 turn left into Paly. Do not go through
| the underpass, but turn right into
the northwest connecting road.
After an arterial stop where Palm
Drive starts over El Camino, turn
left over the El Camino underpass.
4. Going north on El Camino, to
turn left to campus. Go right into
the southeast connecting road, stop
and turn left over the El Camino
underpass.
GENERAL RULES
5. To turn right, at any time.
Merely go into the appropriate con
necting road and keep going. If you
do this right, you shouldn't have to
go under or over either underpass.
Good general rule: decide before
hand where you're going. One
rough got half way through to Paly
the other day, then decided he
wanted to go to San Jose instead.
His was a gruesome death.
