MEXICO CIT¥, Fob. 16 (UP).—A
sensational report, lacking any offi
cial confirmation, of a huge Nazi
"fifth column" conspiracy embrac
ing both North and South America
and including plans to sabotage U.S.
defense preparations, circulated in
usually informed quarters here to
day.
The report, received in some
American quarters with a measure
of belief, could not be confirmed by
the United Press.
Headquarters of the conspiracy
were said to be in Philadelphia.
(The Philadelphia office of the
F. 8.1, and Philadelphia police de
nied any knowledge of the report.)
The Mexican sources presented
documents which they said proved
the existence of a Nazi-controlled
nationalist party in Mexico. They
said the organization is built on the
principle of "cell" structure.
It was said that the Japanese have
co-operated with the conspiracy re
cently.
