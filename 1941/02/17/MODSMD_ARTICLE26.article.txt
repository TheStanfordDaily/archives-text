# Oil Engineer To Address Men Tonight
## H. H. Hall to Discuss Engineering in Vocom Series at 7 in Encina 
### 
H. H. Hall, chief engineer of the
Standard Oil Company, will speak on
the third program of the current Vo
cational Problems Series this evening
in Encina lobby. His subject will
be "Engineering."
The talk will last from 7 to 8
o'clock, and as usual will not be al
lowed to go beyond that time, so
that study schedules will not be in
terfered with. Fraternity men will
bo excused from Monday night
house meetings in order to attend
the talks.
Mr. Hall indicated in a letter re
ceived yesterday that he would em
phasize engineering in his discus
sion, rather than "Engineering and
Production," as was originally an
nounced. He said he would be
willing to answer questions about
the production field, however.
The Vocational Problems Series is
being presented for the second year
under the joint sponsorship of the
Men's Vocational Committee and the
office of the Dean of Men. It was
opened two weeks ago by Dean
J. Hugh Jackson of the Graduate
School of Business, who talked on
"Business," and was continued last
week with a discussion of "Educa
tion" by Acting Dean Alvin C. En
rich of the School of Education.
Three more talks besides that of
Mr. Hall will be given. Next Mon
day E. V. Krick, vice-president of
the American Trust Company, will
speak on "Banking." His talk will
be followed on March 3 by Dean
L. R. Chandler of the Stanford
School of Medicine, who will talk
on "A Career in Medicine."
The series will be closed on March
10 by Dean M. R. Kirkwood of the
Stanford' law school, who will dis
cuss the legal profession.
