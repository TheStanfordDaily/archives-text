# Essay Prize Winner Predicts Dangers of Farm's Isolation

(Editor's Note: Following is the
second half of Bill Wilton's prize
winning essay in The Stanford
Daily's "Know Stanford" contest.
The first half of the essay, en
titled "Stanford's Next Fifty
Years." appeared in Friday's is
sue of The Daily.)

Aloofness from the daily news and
current trends, a dangerous habit of
present-day Stanford students, will
only result in a typo of "cultural
inertia," or slack interests in the
world about us, and may seriously
affect the student body as a whole.
Therefore, the need of a much closer
contact between school and the pub
lic affairs is of utmost importance
and necessity.
Public relation, extension, and
specialization courses, popular to
day, have started a decided trend
of the future. Thus, broadly speak
ing, the University must give itself
the job of linking and embodying the
theoretical with the practical aspects
of human affairs.
IDEAL CAMPUS
Materially and culturally, Stan
ford will grow and expand, but it
will have these future years not
only to enlarge, but to improve and
modify in form. The idealized Stan
ford campus, with a science quad,
separate and self-contained grad
uate law and business schools, and
a complete aeronautical school will
perhaps be realities 50 years from
now.
In these cases, because needs
are already apparent, we may ex
pect fulfillment. With certain ex
pansions, mainly concerned with
the increasngly important upper
division and graduate courses,
will come greater individualities
j and specialization in the chosen
specific ideals.
The ultimate creation of individual
students, each with his own mind
and abilities, is a primary Stanford
aim, and ideal, if not idealized type
of plan. The creation of individ
ualism, as first fostered by Dr. Jor
dan during his presidency, is of
greatest importance and conse
quence in Stanford ideals. Through
many years it has become the com
mon denominator of abili'y'and suc
cess, and perhaps marks the turning
point in a college training.
TOLERANCE AND CHARITY
Through the preaching of hu
manity and social understanding of
those nations presently imbued with
doctrines contrary to ours, toler
ance and charity must become prime
factors in the future educational
system, and must be constantly
stressed.
The restlessness, fluctuations,
and changcs of the years to come
must be met with firmness and
analysis of thought, coupled with
an insight inherent in the modern
student. Stanford, as one of Amer
ica's most influential cultural in
stitutions, must provide those
qualities to its students, and must
enlarge along lines of broad and
international scope. Such is the task
| of Stanford's future, and of the

next 50 years.
To interpret and to change Von
Hutton's words from the abstract
into fixed ideals, purposes, and ac
tualities has been Stanford's respon
sibility, and must remain so even
more in the dark years to come.
Blessed with independence, facility
of operation, an organization flexible
to the demands of the worlds of
science, politics, and business, and
possessing a heritage honorable and
cherished throughout the years,
Stanford will doubtlessly mold a fu
ture as broad and as rich in cultural
elements as have witnessed its years
of infancy.
Toward the future we look with
promise of great reward, and from
the past we gain increased strength
and devotion in the fulfillment of
the Stanfords' dream — a great me
morial to Leland Stanford Junior.

current trends, a dangerous habit of
present-day Stanford students, will
only result in a typo of "cultural
inertia," or slack interests in the
world about us, and may seriously
affect the student body as a whole.
Therefore, the need of a much closer
contact between school and the pub
lic affairs is of utmost importance
and necessity.
Public relation, extension, and
specialization courses, popular to
day, have started a decided trend
of the future. Thus, broadly speak
ing, the University must give itself
the job of linking and embodying the
theoretical with the practical aspects
of human affairs.
IDEAL CAMPUS
Materially and culturally, Stan
ford will grow and expand, but it
will have these future years not
only to enlarge, but to improve and
modify in form. The idealized Stan
ford campus, with a science quad,
separate and self-contained grad
uate law and business schools, and
a complete aeronautical school will
perhaps be realities 50 years from
now.
In these cases, because needs
are already apparent, we may ex
pect fulfillment. With certain ex
pansions, mainly concerned with
the increasngly important upper
division and graduate courses,
will come greater individualities
j and specialization in the chosen
specific ideals.
The ultimate creation of individual
students, each with his own mind
and abilities, is a primary Stanford
aim, and ideal, if not idealized type
of plan. The creation of individ
ualism, as first fostered by Dr. Jor
dan during his presidency, is of
greatest importance and conse
quence in Stanford ideals. Through
many years it has become the com
mon denominator of abili'y'and suc
cess, and perhaps marks the turning
point in a college training.
TOLERANCE AND CHARITY
Through the preaching of hu
manity and social understanding of
those nations presently imbued with
doctrines contrary to ours, toler
ance and charity must become prime
factors in the future educational
system, and must be constantly
stressed.
The restlessness, fluctuations,
and changcs of the years to come
must be met with firmness and
analysis of thought, coupled with
an insight inherent in the modern
student. Stanford, as one of Amer
ica's most influential cultural in
stitutions, must provide those
qualities to its students, and must
enlarge along lines of broad and
international scope. Such is the task
| of Stanford's future, and of the

next 50 years.
To interpret and to change Von
Hutton's words from the abstract
into fixed ideals, purposes, and ac
tualities has been Stanford's respon
sibility, and must remain so even
more in the dark years to come.
Blessed with independence, facility
of operation, an organization flexible
to the demands of the worlds of
science, politics, and business, and
possessing a heritage honorable and
cherished throughout the years,
Stanford will doubtlessly mold a fu
ture as broad and as rich in cultural
elements as have witnessed its years
of infancy.
Toward the future we look with
promise of great reward, and from
the past we gain increased strength
and devotion in the fulfillment of
the Stanfords' dream — a great me
morial to Leland Stanford Junior.
