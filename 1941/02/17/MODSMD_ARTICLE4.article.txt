# Wilbur Advocates Draft Revision
## 
### 
President Ray Lyman Wilbur to
day advocated enactment of legisla
tion to prevent drafting of medical
students under the Selective Service
Act. In his report as chairman of
the Council of Medical Education
and Hospitals of the American Med
ical Association meeting in Chicago,
Dr. Wilbur said:
"If those in authority in this coun
try are wise they will make provi
sions through legislation so that no
medical student can be drafted or
volunteer, and that those who are
proposing to study medicine are
given adequate trial before they are
drafted into some other line of
duty."
