# Albert Stars in Rugby Game
## 
### 
Sparked by (he daring, and at times unbelievable play of little Frankie
Alberl, Stanford's varsity rugby team downed the Olympic Club by a
9-4 count 011 a water-soaked field Saturday afternoon.
Splashing bis way across the muddy field, Albert led bis teammates
to victory in one of the best rugby games played 011 the local field, ac-

counting for six of (ho Indians' nine,
points.
The first half saw the ball moving
back and forth across the field, with
play remaining for the most part in
Olympic territory. With the time al
most up, Franny Morgan followed
Roger Laverty's long kick across the
goal-line and fell on it for a try. Al
bert made the conversion to give
the Cards a 5-0 lead as the half
time gun sounded.
The club squad came back strong
at the first of the second period, and
with Hugh Gallarneau leading a
passing rush, worked their way deep
into Stanford territory, where Mus
sey made a running drop-kick to
bring the count to 5-4.
After the following kick-off,
Stanford returned to the attack and
worked its way up the field in a
series of short passing and dribbling
rushes. A scrum was callcd on the
10-yard line, and after the ball was
worked into the open, Albert took a
lateral and kicked the ball squarely
through the posts while on the dead
run to-put Stanford out in front. 9-4.
Earlier in the game, Standlee had
almost powered his way over the
line from about 40 yards out, but
was overhauled from behind by
Gallarneau. However, it was Albert
who made the game a thriller for
the fans to watch. Handling the
muddy ball perfectly, despite its
slippery condition, Albert's running
and kicking were exceptional.
It was the inspired play of the
Stanford forward wall that made
the win possible, however. Follow
ing the ball to a man, they consist
ently outplayed the supposedly
stronger Club, and managed to con
trol the ball at crucial times.

into Stanford territory, where Mus
sey made a running drop-kick to
bring the count to 5-4.
After the following kick-off,
Stanford returned to the attack and
worked its way up the field in a
series of short passing and dribbling
rushes. A scrum was callcd on the
10-yard line, and after the ball was
worked into the open, Albert took a
lateral and kicked the ball squarely
through the posts while on the dead
run to-put Stanford out in front. 9-4.
Earlier in the game, Standlee had
almost powered his way over the
line from about 40 yards out, but
was overhauled from behind by
Gallarneau. However, it was Albert
who made the game a thriller for
the fans to watch. Handling the
muddy ball perfectly, despite its
slippery condition, Albert's running
and kicking were exceptional.
It was the inspired play of the
Stanford forward wall that made
the win possible, however. Follow
ing the ball to a man, they consist
ently outplayed the supposedly
stronger Club, and managed to con
trol the ball at crucial times.
Sparked by (he daring, and at times unbelievable play of little Frankie
Alberl, Stanford's varsity rugby team downed the Olympic Club by a
9-4 count 011 a water-soaked field Saturday afternoon.
Splashing bis way across the muddy field, Albert led bis teammates
to victory in one of the best rugby games played 011 the local field, ac-

counting for six of (ho Indians' nine,
points.
The first half saw the ball moving
back and forth across the field, with
play remaining for the most part in
Olympic territory. With the time al
most up, Franny Morgan followed
Roger Laverty's long kick across the
goal-line and fell on it for a try. Al
bert made the conversion to give
the Cards a 5-0 lead as the half
time gun sounded.
The club squad came back strong
at the first of the second period, and
with Hugh Gallarneau leading a
passing rush, worked their way deep
into Stanford territory, where Mus
sey made a running drop-kick to
bring the count to 5-4.
