### CHUCK SMITH 
1 r £"UIIS is a lot like getting up in
front of a bunch of people to
make a big speoeh. I'm just a little
tied up—don't krinw where to begin
or exactly what to say. Gotta make
a good first impression—gotta start
wowing 'em from the very begin
ning.
The only conventional thing to do
I is to thank my ex-boss Jerry
Brucker lor the nice build-up last
Friday and toss a few orchids back
at him. Still I'm not starting off in
this fashion for convention's sake
: but because it is the first thing that
| comes to mind. Jerry certainly ought
to be congratulated for the fine job
last volume.
It's gcing to be easy to pick up
where be left off. Example: Smith
didn't blow into the Daily shack
with the sports assignment sheet
initJl 4 yesterday afternoon (that's
very late) and yet, because of Mr,
lirufker's lingering influence, there
were already three sports stories
written and a fourth in the making,
* * #
Next should come a statement of
policy, the launching of some big
, campaign, or promises to protect the
| poor Stanford athletes, coaches, and
student body from the tyrannical
| Board of Athletic Control.
I have no particular campaign in
mind and my only policy will be
like that of the harrassed umpire,
referee, etc., who "calls 'cm as he
sees 'em."
As for the omnipresent shadow of
the B.A.C.—there's a problem. May
be I have underestimated the power
of the press in general and the in
fluence of this column in particular.
But I don t believe there is anything
I could possibly say which would
stop the board from going on in its
own sweet way — oblivious of the
wishes of athletes, coaches, and stu
dent body.
If (he moguls of the board will
ignore as important a personage
as football coach Clark Shiuigh
nessy as they did in scheduling a
game with (he University of San
Francisco Dons next October 18,
they certainly won't pay any a(-
tention to a Daily sports editor

popping off.
Now for just a little crowing about
sports in general on the campus. You
know, it's the easiest thing in the
world to write about a winning ball
club. And therefore this job ought
lo be pretty soft.
Following the example set by the
footballers last falls, Coach Everett
Dean and his race-and-chase bas
ketball teams is sewing up the
Southern Division Conference race
and has been named more than
once the best team in the nation.
A Stanford rugby team, sprinkled
liberally with Rose Bowl football
stars, is undefeated as yet and ought
to win their league, conference, or
what-have-you which is formally
known as the Northern California
Rugby Union.
Things always look bright out
on the hasehall diamond before
the season gets under way, but this
year it is more than just wishful
thinking. With a strengthened
pitching staff and some good ex
hibitions of sharp hitting in its
first couple of games, the Stan
ford nine has a real chance of liv
ing up to the annually bright
pre-season predictions.
Tennis and golf are riding on the
crest of the wave with a wealth of
veterans returning in both sports.
The swimming team, if a few mat
ters of academics are ironed out, will
be the best in Farm history. This
leaves track as possibly the only
dark spot on the sports calendar.
