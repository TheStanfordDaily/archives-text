# Dear Hutch:
## 
### 
THREE and a half years ago a bunch of frosh
walked into the Shack for the first time. You
were one of them, and I was another. We
hadn't quite gotten used to the easy familiarity
of life at Encina then and v/e were a bit amazed
at it all: the cheerful abandon of the clattering
typewriters; the way the old-timers gagged
everything up for a few laughs; the sing ses
sions; and the amazing volume of work they
managed to slip in between all those interesting
diversions.
Remember it all, Hutch? And remember how
quiet we were those first few days in the Shack,
especially when the Editor, the Great Man,
walked past? Remember, boy, how we held
our breaths until he'd gone by?
Friday you walked out of the familiar little
cubicle that's been your office for half a year
and the working center for Volume 98. And
frankly, Hutch, this time I'M holding my breath.
Because you've left Volume 99 and me more
than an office, a desk, and a battered Under
wood to push around.
You've left us both a pair of shoes that are
going to be mighty hard to fill.
It's hard to throw bouquets at the regular sort
of guy that you are, Hutch. So let's toss them
at old 98 instead. But the campus will know
what I mean. Volume 98 spelled Hutchinson
from start to finish. And that's probably the
reason it's been so confounded good.
Those 78 issues of The Daily that ended Fri
day with a " —30 —" up where the ear went 77
times before wasn't the conscious crusader that
many volumes have been. The Daily didn't
spend its time hacking into things in the blissful
way that a bull spends an evening going
through a china shop.
Volume 98 was the other kind of crusader.
The sort that has ideas and ideals . . . and isn't
afraid to use them. The crusader who doesn't
go out looking for trouble but who isn't afraid
to meet it when it comes his way.
The Daily didn't manufacture any yellow
journalese scare-crusades while you were at the
helm, Hutch. Nor did The Daily side-step any
thing that crossed its own ideals and beliefs.
That's the sort of stuff that good newspapers
are made of.
No use enumerating the swell things that you
and 98 filed on the "things completed" hook.
They'd fill these editorial columns twice over.
And most of them have been the sort of thing
that the campus won't be forgetting soon.

Tonight, with the savory remnants of 98 still
knocking through the Shack, two comparative
youngsters at this newspaper game—Volume
99 and I—are trying on those shoes that 98 and
its Editor left for us to fill.
Neither of us is going to make any rash prom
ises or outline any far-reaching program to
night. One thing we are sure of: that the Under
wood on the little green table will see plenty
of hard usage before 99 and I are through.
There will be no major changes in typogra
phy. Little 99 will look very much like her
older brothers and sisters. There will be, how
ever, an added emphasis on the little things
that are news about the campus . . . the things
that are the spice to life on the Farm. And
sports, news, and editorial sections all will do
their darnedest to give a continually reliable
and interesting picture of the events of the day.
One thing 99 and I both are sure of. That
Stanford is the best of all possible universities.
But at the same time we both know that even
this best has its weak chinks. Hutch and Volume
98 found most of them and pushed many into
public view and along the way toward cor
rection.
Some of these could be mentioned now. The
"ivory tower" attitude; that parking situation;
and the many more major and minor difficulties
that rust the joints of this institution.
We'll have more to say about these—Volume
99 and I—before we sift into retirement.
Another thing both of us are sure of. That
America and her democratic precepts are the
best of all possible institutions. But, similarly,
these two have been grotesquely altered during
the swiftly paced events of the past few years.
Those tenets of democracy, free speech, and a
free thinking people that have meant so much
to generations of Americans don't seem to carry
the weight they once did.
They will to 99 and me.
And there's another thing that both of us
are sure of. Peace is the best of all possible
institutions, even in this world of 1941 where
Europe has turned into another hotbed of cin
ders and coals. Perhaps peace can be accom
plished with you and me maintaining the status
of onlookers; perhaps peace will spread her

wings over the world again only after you and
I have entered that hotbed to sweep out those
cinders and coals.
We hope American youth will never again
be sacrificed on the altar of Mars. Perhaps
that will not be possible . . . present events
whisper that we will know "oy June.
But above all we hope that clear, unbiased,
free thinking will dictate the course we take;
and that America will make no jumps impelled
merely by the propaganda of those who can
gain by taking our nation to war.

And say, Hutch, I'd like to add one more
thing. If they toss 99 and me just half the bou
quets they'll be tossing you and 98 . . . we'll
both be happy.
