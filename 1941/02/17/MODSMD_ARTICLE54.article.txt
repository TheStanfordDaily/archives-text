# BULL SESSION
## 
### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
BACK FROM THE SUNSET
Friday Bud Ames typed a "thirty-line" on
Bull Session for the last time and climbed up the
back-page ladder into the editorial column. My case
is quite the opposite. I eased down the ladder to Bull
Session. I think maybe people read Bull Session; I
have no illusions about the way they read (I mean
do not read) editorials, and so I feel that I'm stra
tegically in a better spot today.
That implies that I'll have something to say—and
that's an extremely doubtful point.

J FEEL rather acutely that mine is an awkward posi
tion. In the first place, I said "good-bye" last
Friday, handed my keys to the new editor, closed the
door firmly behind me, and walked sadly and wanly
away into the Sunset, trailing small wisps of pink
clouds. I am now a little embarrassed to be back so
soon. And I feel sort of like the guy who, having said
farewells to all the family that came to the station,
missed the train.
If I do feel a little bit sheepish, I can condition that
feeling with the argument that this is not a perma
nent assignment. Bull Session will be written by
Jerry Mayer as soon as he leaves that hospital.
In other words, I'm strictly a "gap" man and I'm
still carrying in my most inner heart the dream of a
fine, social spring quarter.

A this hedging, of course, centers about the fact
that I'm scared of Bull Session. It has been con
ducted so beautifully by my predecessors that I can
not help but suffer in comparison. Johnny Cobbs wrote
it for three volumes. John was a master of both the
metaphor and the jack-knife. His figures of speech
influenced Daily writing for more than his term, and
his wood-carving has so undermined the Shack that
we expect it to collapse suddenly and leave us scram
bling in the debris.
A1 Drury took over for a volume. For relaxation,
just as breathers for his readers, A1 introduced Emery
Bellwether to the campus. He became an overnight
favorite and, if I recall correctly, was such a strong
write-in candidate on the A.S.S.U. ballot that he
almost won himself an Excom job.
Sherm Mellinkoff continued an old tradition beau
tifully for a year. Sherm was number .three Mellin
koff to handle Bull Session and maintained always
the high standard set by his brothers. His duels with
Hortense Figgins and his marvelous columns from the
East when he was on the debate tour with Bob
Moulton will never be forgotten around Stanford.
This year Bud Ames picked up a lot of new read
ers for the column with a style that was never stale,
always good for a laugh or two. No tremendous cam
paigns were undertaken; no particular causes fos
tered.
My specific brand of Bull Session will tag along at
the heels of all the rest —it won't have any big axes
to grind or great aims to accomplish. We hope that
it will be comfortable, sometimes amusing, and rarely
informative.
