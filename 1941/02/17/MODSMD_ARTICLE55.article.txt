## MR. GUY IS WRONG? 
### 
r EDITOR, SIR:
Last Friday there appeared in your Campus Opin
ion column a letter by a gentleman named Literary
Guy. Mr. Guy's letter was an outstanding example
of impertinence, since he there attempted to criticize
publicly a plan which had not yet had an opportu
nity of presenting itself to the public in a fully ma
tured state and concerning which Mr. Guy had formed
a number of beautifully erroneous ideas.
Mr. Guy began as follows: "The other day (actu
ally, Mr. Guy, it was four or five weeks ago) some
students were sitting around in the Women's Club
house waiting for something or other to happen."
What these students were waiting for was a meeting
of the Writers Club, and there was present a person
with an idea, who hoped to discuss it with the club.
The idea was a plan for the formation of a student
literary, scientific, and general interest magazine on
the Stanford campus, and while waiting for the meet
ing to begin, this person discussed his plan in an in
complete, off-hand manner with the four members of
the Writers Club who had showed up. The expected
meeting never materialized beyond this point, and on
this desultory discussion Mr. Guy based the opinions
which he expressed in his letter.
Mr. Guy felt the plan as he understood it would
not be "representative, in material or appeal to the
campus at large." We agree with Mr. Guy as he under
stood it, but the point is that he misunderstood. The
plan as it actually stands is designed with the special
purpose of being representative and of filling a defi
nite need on the campus.
The purpose of the proposed magazine is not at
all to "give the people who missed, out in the year
book the fun of seeing themselves in print." The
magazine is not planned to be purely literary. To be
sure, a large part of the idea is to give Stanford writ
ers a regular monthly publication in which they will
have an opportunity of interesting and amusing the
public with their brain-and-pen children; but this is
not all.
The magazine is also intended to give the entire
student body an opportunity of expressing, in essays
and articles, its opinions on all matters of current in
terest and popular concern, and occasionally to fea
ture articles by experts in various fields. There is
concentrated on this campus the finest and most varie
gated group of talent on the Pacific Coast, and by
drawing on this, Stanford should be able to produce
a magazine thoroughly interesting to all types of read
ers. We feel that such a magazine would be of great
value to Stanford and would fill a need which is not
and cannot be expected to be filled by The Daily .the
Chaparral, the Quad, or the Yearbook of Stanford
Writing.
Hoping that, now that the facts have been more
completely stated, Mr. Guy and his associates will
feel differently, we remain,
Those who are at present concerned with the plan
