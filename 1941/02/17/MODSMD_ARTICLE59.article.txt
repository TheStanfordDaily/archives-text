# Russell, Douglas Riotous As Sex Rears Its Head

### 
"THIS THING CALLED LOVE," now playing at the Stanford Theater.
Rosalind Russell in "This Thing Called Love," keeps up the fast pace
she started in "The Women" and manages to hring this picture out as a
top rate comedy. Melvyn Douglas is fast pressing Cary Grant for the
title of top comedy star of Hollywood.

"This Thing Called Love" deals<
with a woman who hag* evolved "a
practical plan for the solution of
marriage problems" and intends to
try it out on the man whom she
plans to marry.
The hitch comes when her pro
posed husband returns from the
wilds of Peru and flatly refuses to
try the plan. The plan is a dilly; in
order to guard their marriage against
divorce, the couple will be husband
and wife in name only for three
months.
BORING FROM WITHIN
On the advice of his lawyer, the
husband decides to give in to the
wife but to begin his weakening
down process from within. Under
the spell of champagne, soft lights
and music she almost gives in to
him. She comes across a copy of
her plan just in time, and his plan
falls through.
In the meantime, the husband,
who has a big business deal to worry
about as well as his marriage prob
lems, invites the big Peruvian
banker who is about to give him a
million dollar loan out to the house
for the week-end.
He thinks he has played his trump
card since the house has only two
rooms and one will have to be given
to the banker. Complications soon
develop: the banker is the devoted
father and he thinks any family
that doesn't have children, well! To
overcome this, the lawyer and the
husband dream up a prospective
mother scene for the wife, who
knows nothing about the Peruvian
house guest, his ideas about children
or her own blessed event-to-be.
MORE COMPLICATIONS
She arrives with a number of
guests, including the estranged wife
of the lawyer who has left her hus
band because she thinks he has
given his secretary a $200 dress.
In a scene frigid with icy stares
the dinner party gets under way.
Each time the subject turns to
babies, the husband jumps up to
propose a toast: to South America,
to the United States, to the Amer
icas, and finally winds up by making
everybody stand up and sing
"America" right in the middle of
the meat course.
In a nasty little scene the law
yer's wife rips off the $200 dress
and the girls really "step ten." The
husband gets so disgusted he goes
out swimming with the secretai'y
and gets poison oak, the wife goes
out with another man, and the hus
band comes home to find him in his
bed and several other things hap
pen before everything finally
straightens itself out.

Smooth direction managed to get
these questionable scenes past the
Hays office. A relative newcomer,
Allyn Joslyn, get in some excellent
acting as the lawyer. Binnie Barnes
shows off the $200 dress to its best
advantage, also shows off well when
the dress is ripped off.
Rosalind Russell and Melvyn
Douglas both keep this picture above
most comedies. For good and not too
clean fun, "This Thing Called Love"
is the best. Definitely up any
Stanford student's alley.
There is no second feature to de
tract from the main picture. The
March of Time presents an excel
lent resume of labor and defense
industry problems. Good for Poli
Sci I.—Wuenschel

months.
BORING FROM WITHIN
On the advice of his lawyer, the
husband decides to give in to the
wife but to begin his weakening
down process from within. Under
the spell of champagne, soft lights
and music she almost gives in to
him. She comes across a copy of
her plan just in time, and his plan
falls through.
In the meantime, the husband,
who has a big business deal to worry
about as well as his marriage prob
lems, invites the big Peruvian
banker who is about to give him a
million dollar loan out to the house
for the week-end.
He thinks he has played his trump
card since the house has only two
rooms and one will have to be given
to the banker. Complications soon
develop: the banker is the devoted
father and he thinks any family
that doesn't have children, well! To
overcome this, the lawyer and the
husband dream up a prospective
mother scene for the wife, who
knows nothing about the Peruvian
house guest, his ideas about children
or her own blessed event-to-be.
MORE COMPLICATIONS
She arrives with a number of
guests, including the estranged wife
of the lawyer who has left her hus
band because she thinks he has
given his secretary a $200 dress.
In a scene frigid with icy stares
the dinner party gets under way.
Each time the subject turns to
babies, the husband jumps up to
propose a toast: to South America,
to the United States, to the Amer
icas, and finally winds up by making
everybody stand up and sing
"America" right in the middle of
the meat course.
In a nasty little scene the law
yer's wife rips off the $200 dress
and the girls really "step ten." The
husband gets so disgusted he goes
out swimming with the secretai'y
and gets poison oak, the wife goes
out with another man, and the hus
band comes home to find him in his
bed and several other things hap
pen before everything finally
straightens itself out.

Smooth direction managed to get
these questionable scenes past the
Hays office. A relative newcomer,
Allyn Joslyn, get in some excellent
acting as the lawyer. Binnie Barnes
shows off the $200 dress to its best
advantage, also shows off well when
the dress is ripped off.
Rosalind Russell and Melvyn
Douglas both keep this picture above
most comedies. For good and not too
clean fun, "This Thing Called Love"
is the best. Definitely up any
Stanford student's alley.
There is no second feature to de
tract from the main picture. The
March of Time presents an excel
lent resume of labor and defense
industry problems. Good for Poli
Sci I.—Wuenschel
"THIS THING CALLED LOVE," now playing at the Stanford Theater.
Rosalind Russell in "This Thing Called Love," keeps up the fast pace
she started in "The Women" and manages to hring this picture out as a
top rate comedy. Melvyn Douglas is fast pressing Cary Grant for the
title of top comedy star of Hollywood.

"This Thing Called Love" deals<
with a woman who hag* evolved "a
practical plan for the solution of
marriage problems" and intends to
try it out on the man whom she
plans to marry.
The hitch comes when her pro
posed husband returns from the
wilds of Peru and flatly refuses to
try the plan. The plan is a dilly; in
order to guard their marriage against
divorce, the couple will be husband
and wife in name only for three
months.
