## Stefansson to Speak On Sub-Arctic Lands 
### 
The Arctic and sub-Arctic areas
with iheir virtually unexploited
natural resources and vast unpopu
lated areas may yet provide a sane
ajiswer to the world's present frenzy
for "breathing space," according to
Vilhjalmur Stefansson, Arctic ex
plorer, who comes here tomorrow
night to speak on the Tuesday Series
at 7:30 in the auditorium of Memo
rial Hall.
The recent Slattery Report from
the United States Department of the
Interior, which deals with the colo
nization of Alaska, gives special
credit to Stefansson as a source of
information upon which the gov
ernment has depended.
IMMIGRATION ENCOURAGED
The recommendations of the De
partment that immigration to Alaska
be encouraged are thus based ma
terially upon the facts collected and
the views developed by Stefansson
during 30 years of polar explorations
and the study of northern literature.
But our government was not the
first to recognize that the field work
and the writings of Stefansson were
leading men's minds away from the
old idea of the barren and hostile
North. The facts he gave and the
views he expressed in "The Friendly
Arctic" (1921) and "The Northward
Course of Empire" (1922) had re
ceived advance endorsement through
a citation giving him the official
thanks of the Canadian government.
