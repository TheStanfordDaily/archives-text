J JACK in the 1920's Soviet Russia,
all involved in the new social
experiment known as Communism,
was rather like an awkward adol
escent. She was bungling, not quite
sure what to do with her diplomatic
hands and feet.
And because the U.S.S.R. was
serving as the test-crucible for anti
capitalistic national orders, the great
"have" nations, the United States,
Great Britain, and France, chose to
regard her as a pariah state.
But today, in a certain sense,
Josef Stalin is the one riding the
pogo stick of European power
politics. The rest of the nations
bouncing along, hanging onto their
equilibrium as best they can,
watch him anxiously for every
shift in weight.
He would be less than human if
he were not enjoying this reversal of
affairs. Comrade Stalin is important;
and yesterday he let his weight be
felt.

r |MIE sudden deflation of both Bul
garia and Turkey (see story in
column 1) is obviously due to Soviet
influence. One concrete promise of
Soviet backing and these two na
tions would never have meekly en
tered into a "non-aggression" pact—
particularly after all Turkey's loud
talk.
Hut, perhaps more important,
are the "formal conversations for
a trade treaty between Russia and
Japan" which started yesterday.
' r he Japanese have already hap
'Jy announced that "most prob
<ns between the two nations al
idy have been solved or are in
process of settlement."
Russo-Japanese economic prob
lems have long been festering, and it
is undoubtedly high time that they
got together and did something
about them. However, these days,
treaties often mean far more (or
less for that matter) than their ac
tual announced contents.

JN the summer of '119, if you re
member, the first news of Soviet-
German accord came with the an
nouncement of an agreement be
tween the two countries. That this
present announcement came after
last week's conference in Moscow
between the German, Italian, and
Japanese ambassadors to the Soviet
and the Japanese-ambassador desig
nate to Germany is not an insignifi
cant item either.
Major deterrent to Japan's
avowed policy of "drive to the
South" has been the very huge and
very hostile U.S.S.R. With a mil
lion men still under arms in the
China incident, such a drive was
considered sheer suicide; and
most observers have assumed that
even the hari-kari-loving Nippon
ese would think twice before at
tempting the move.
In Hainan some (50,000 Japanese
troops have been concentrated for a
southern drive. Weak, Vichy-loyal
Indo-China has 6000 of the little
brown men within her borders, and
cruisers and destroyers are on regu
lar patrol between Malaya and
Indo-China.

| AST week, Japan stationed 13,000
troops in Haiphong, and took
over the offices of Air France and
the airdrome in Saigon. Saigon is
within easy bombing distance of
Singapore, and the British imme
diately whizzed R.A.F. and Austra
lian bombing squadrons to northern
Malaya. Waters around the strategic
Singapore base were mined. All
Americans were urged to get out of
the involved areas, unless their
presence there was absolutely nec
essary.
World War II has consisted, for
the most part, of periods of wait
ing—waiting for all hell to break
loose somewhere else. We're in
one of those periods now. Wait
ing for (hat attempt to knock out
Great Britain.
Whether Japan will join her Axis
partners in the attempt when it
comes, may depend on those inter
esting "formal conversations" now
going on in Moscow. And Josef
Stalin, as head of the U.S.S.R., can
be sure that he and his country are
very important indeed.
