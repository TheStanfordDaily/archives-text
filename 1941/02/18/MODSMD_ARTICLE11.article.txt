# Encina 'Snake Fancier' Earns His Tuition by Selling Venom
## 
### HERMAN SILVERMAN 
There are ways of earning one's tuition, and then, there are ways of
earning one's tuition.
In the latter classification is the method used by freshman
French, who has developed what is perhaps the most amazing means of
earning tuition since the good Senator opened the doors of this institution.

Method: Raising snakes and selling,
their venom.
French has always been interested
in snakes. Let's call him a "snake
fancier." So at his home in Los An
geles he started collecting them—boa
constrictors, rubber boas, rattlers,
moccasins, coral snakes, bull and
indigo snakes, and many other
species.
At one time French captured 80
of his wriggling friends and housed
them in a small building filled with
cages. Furthermore, our snake
fancier raised his own supply of
guinea pigs, rats, and mice—his pets
had to eat.
The raising of snakes, however,
proved to be more than a hobby,
for the "rattlers" proved to be com
mercially valuable. French learned
to extract venom from the rattlers,
which he sold for $25 an ounce to
drug houses engaged in manufactur
ing anti-venom for sale to travel
ers in rattlesnake-infested country.
Leigh French has been bitten
so many times that he has lost
exact count. Too much poison,
however, began to weaken his
heart, so he has given up reptology
for geology, his intended major at
Stanford.
But he didn't quit snake-milking
until he had enough money from
selling venom to pay for his first
year's tuition. At. the current venom
tuition ratio, 16 ounces did the trick.
