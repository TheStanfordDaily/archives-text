# Turkey, Bulgaria Open Balkan Sesame to Nazis With Friendship Pact
## German Troops Expected to Move Through Bulgaria in High Pressure Attempt to Force Peace on Greeks 
### 
SOFIA, Bulgaria, Feb. 17 (UP). â€”Adolf Hitler appeared tonight to have
cleared (he way for a German push across Bulgaria, presumably to force
Greece into a negotiated peace, after Turkey and Bulgaria issued a joint
declaration of "perpetual friendship" and non-aggression.
The declaration announced Monday was generally regarded to mean

following the lead of neigh
boring Russia, will remain passive
when and if the German army occu
pies Bulgaria.
High quarters predicted German
armed forces may be expected to
move through Bulgaria "perhaps in
only a matter of days now" to bring
direct pressure on Greece to make
peace with Italy.
Although Turkey's mutual aid
pact with Great Britain is to remain
effective, it was said in some quar
ters to have been greatly weak
ened.
Under the mutual aid pact, which
also remained uninvoked when Italy
invaded Greece, the Turks promised
to go to war 011 Britain's side in
event of aggression spreading the
war to the eastern Mediterranean.
(In London diplomatic quarters
called the Turkish-Bulgarian dec
laration an Axis triumph which
probably means that the Turks, de
spite their mutual aid alliance with
Britain, will not move militarily if
Germany carries out a military oc
cupation of Bulgaria. Russia was
understood to have been informed in
advance of the declaration.)
Bulgaria is resigned to a German
occupation, regarding herself as "on
the spot" and powerless to put up re
sistance, "which would be tanta
mount to committing suicide," a high
source said.
