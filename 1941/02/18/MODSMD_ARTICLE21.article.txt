# Polar Explorer Talks Tonight
## 
### 
Vilhjalmur Stefansson, America's
greatest authority on Arctic condi
tions, will speak for the Tuesday Se
ries tonight at 7:30 o'clock in the
auditorium of the Memorial Hall.
Though he has mapped and ex
plored vast areas of heretofore un
known polar lands and seas and
added three new islands to northern
maps, Stefansson is best known as
the scientist who debunked the the
ory that man could not live by meat
alone.
CHANGES DIET IDEAS
Until he published his observa
tions on the diet of the Eskimos and
his own party of white explorers in
Arctic l-egions, most doctors thought
that the use of a large percentage of
meat in the diet would produce
hardening of the arteries and high
blood pressure and bring on pre
mature old age.
Through his own experiences and
that of his companions, Stefansson
showed that if "fresh fruit and vege
tables" were omitted from the diet,
scurvy would not be the result and
that, white men are just as healthy
and happy on an exclusive meat diet
as Eskimos.
To give the medical profession an
opportunity for seeing how an ex
clusive meat diet works under av
erage conditions of city life, Stef
ansson and one of his comrades,
Karsten Andersen, lived in New
York a little more than 12 months
without anything to cat but flesh
and water.
Stefansson's first trip to Iceland
was made in 1904, and he revisited
the country the following year. His
third trip, in l9OfJ-07, was to tihe
Canadian Arctic, where he tried out
his now famous practice of "living off
the country" and proved that white
men could thrive on the Eskimo diet
and enjoy that way of life.

His subsequent expeditions through
nine more Arctic winters were
sponsored by the American Museum
of Natural History of New York and
by the Canadian government. Be
sides his several Arctic expeditions,
Stefansson made a journey to the
center of Australia in 1924 as guest
of a scientific investigator for the
Australian government.
