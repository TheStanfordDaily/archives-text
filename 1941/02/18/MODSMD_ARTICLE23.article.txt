BELGRADE, JUGOSLAVIA, Feb.
17 (UP). â€” Adolf Hitler has given
Jugoslavia the choice of collaborat
ing actively with the Axis or of
guaranteeing that she will remain
completely neutral, trustworthy
sources reported tonight.
(Jugoslavia was reported in ad
vices reaching a high foreign diplo
mat in London to be ready to "go
very far to meet German proposals,"
strengthening Hitler's hold on the
Balkans.)
