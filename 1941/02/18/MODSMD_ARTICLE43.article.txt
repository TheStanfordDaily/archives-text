# Cagers Hit Top Form Against S.C.
## 
### 
Perhaps it's too bad that the Stan
ford Indians aren't scheduled to
play any more conference tilts in
Los Angeles this season, for after
what they did to Troy last Week
end, it seems as if L. A. is the place
where the Indians play their ball
game.
Responsible for a good part of the
showing of the Indians was Fordy
Anderson, who played two of his
best games against Troy Friday and
Saturday nights. The 19 points that

he rang up was only a part of it,
for Anderson had the Trojans going
in circles with his clever ball han
dling. It was deceptive passing such
as his that made the Indian fast
break work the way it did.
And a good 50 per cent of the In
dian offense was made up of a fast
break, a fast break that very fre
quently saw Stanford's down-court
men moving in under the Trojan
basket and ringing up two points
before the Barrymen could even get
back on defense.
Besides this fast break, there were
two factors that enabled Stanford to
beat U.S.C. two nights in a row.
They were (1) Stanford's fine free
throw shooting, and (2) Stanford's
excellent defense.
On shots from the free-throw line
Saturday night the Dean-coached
cagers hit what must be their top
for this season, making good on 11
out of 14 free-throw attempts. An
derson at one time sank three
charity tosses within a minute and
a half of play.
It's an odd thing the way these
Indians handle their scoring chores.
For most of the season, Donnie Wil
liams was hitting the hoop with
amazing regularity, and it was al
ways a good guess that he would be
high-point man for the Indians in
most every game.
Then one or another of the Dean
men started raising their totals in
the box scores until every one of
the starters had been high-scorer
in one game or another during the
season. Down in L.A. last week-end
Williams hit a slight scoring slump,
something that happens to even the
best of them. But Don Burness and
Anderson moved right in 1o take
over the tallying job and did such a
good job of it that no one even
missed the points that Williams
usually makes but didn't.
WILLIAMS GOOD
In all probability Williams will get
back up to the top of that scoring
column, for he isn't the type of
player that can be kept down. But
in the meantime the Cards are cer
tain that they have a number of
other boys on the club who can
roll up the score via the field goal
route.
Don Burness' 29 points for two
games is good shooting in any man's
league, and this total should put
him right up at the top in the con
ference scoring column, especially
since last week's leader, Jackie Rob
inson of U.C.L.A., only scored 19
points as the Bruins dropped a pair
to California.
