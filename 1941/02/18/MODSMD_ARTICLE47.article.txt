### CHUCK SMITH 
j from the basketball
j team which returned to the
Farm yesterday more than a little
pleased about their two victories over
| U.S.C. as well as some dope from
i Den Selby, Daily scoop artist who
J saw the decline and fall of Troy:
The Indians had their first break
I in high gear against the once Ter
; rible Trojans. And it was the Cards'
j good condition that paid off in the
final half of both games.
'I hough Coach Everett Dean
used only seven men on both oc
casions. Stanford had the zip and
maintained a wicked pace that had
those Hollywood Redhots drag
ging their tongues on the court.
The only way the Trojan players
could recognize the men tin y were
| supposed to guard was by getting
! used to the view of Dean's cagers
from the rear as they (lashed into
their quick break.
According to Selby. about four
out of every five Stanford buckets
came from within 10 feet of the
bucket, usually on a fast break, and
it was only the long-range sharp
shooting of Trojans Bob Ortnsby and
the newly discovered sophomore,
Alex Omalev, that kept the games
from turning into debacles.

JVOT EVEN in the days of the im
mortal Angelo Henry "Hankus
Pankus" Luisetti did a Stanford
basketball team tuiti back Coach
Sam Barry's outfits four limes in a
row and make the humbling of Troy
so complete. And yet this is just
what the current crop of cagers has
done, boosting the seasonal record
to 18 wins in 20 games.
Despite this and the fact that the
Indians are two full games ahead
of the field in the race for the South
ern Division Conference crown, they
have not as yet sewed up the tide.
California's two rough-house victo
ries over U.C.L.A. have kept alive
the threat from Berkeley.

r jpHOUGH. they lost by a team
score of 5-3 last Friday night to
a tough California Aggie outfit.
Stanford's boxers put on a fine show |

of courage and sportsmanship. Win
or lose it was the Stanford man that
left his corner after the decision to
cross the ring to congratulate or
console his opponent.
That's what warms your heart
about sports on the whole at Stan- J
i ford. I think this kind of spirit is j
so evident on the Card boxing team j
because of Coach Clayton Frye and
his technique of handling the boys.
You can see confidence and
j wisdom pouring from Frye's lips
while he's talking to his fighters
between rounds and his tolerant |
smile for Johnny Ryan's rubbery !
knees and ankles as a result of
! an encounter with a rough and
! tough Farmer boxer was worth
the price of admission alone.
Maybe all the fans didn't notice |
| Mr. Frye's benign countenance but |
j they certainly appreciated Johnny j
Ward's display of finesse anjd ferocity
! in the final, heavyweight bout. John- |
jny blasted the mouthpiece of his .
! opponent halfway across the pavilion
j with a short, sharp right-handed |
| blow, winning his fight by a technical
J knockout and allowing the Farm fans j
to leave quite consoled despite the
final score of the meet.

J saw the decline and fall of Troy:
The Indians had their first break
I in high gear against the once Ter

j good condition that paid off in the
final half of both games.
'I hough Coach Everett Dean
used only seven men on both oc
casions. Stanford had the zip and
maintained a wicked pace that had
those Hollywood Redhots drag
ging their tongues on the court.
The only way the Trojan players
could recognize the men tin y were
| supposed to guard was by getting
! used to the view of Dean's cagers
from the rear as they (lashed into
their quick break.
According to Selby. about four
out of every five Stanford buckets
came from within 10 feet of the
bucket, usually on a fast break, and
it was only the long-range sharp
shooting of Trojans Bob Ortnsby and
the newly discovered sophomore,
Alex Omalev, that kept the games
from turning into debacles.

JVOT EVEN in the days of the im
mortal Angelo Henry "Hankus
Pankus" Luisetti did a Stanford
basketball team tuiti back Coach
Sam Barry's outfits four limes in a

so complete. And yet this is just
what the current crop of cagers has
done, boosting the seasonal record
