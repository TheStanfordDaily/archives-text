## 
### 
It's a double header for Stanford's
frosh hoopsters (his week-end as
the yearlings tarkle Lowell and
Monterey high se!ioo!s Friday and
Saturday, in the preliminaries to the
varsity-U.C.L.A. series.
Lowell, until a week ago, wus 011
top in the prep pennant race, but
dropped into a four-way tie for sec
ond with not much chance of re
gaining its lead. Tumbled by Mis
sion and Polytechnic, the Indians
(confusing, but that's what they
cull themselves) are deadlocked wilh
Mission, Eaiboii, and Commerce.
Possessed of an uncanny shooting
eye, tiny Tommy Low will lead the
Lowell slow break, bail control of
fense. Lew tops the scoring among
his teammates for the season with
a total of 32 points.
Lew's partner at the other forward
spot is Bob Cherry, who is second in
total scoring for the senson. At the
guards are Court Porter, most ag
gressive man on the squad, and Bob
Troppman. Center will be handled
by Bob Arnold.
On the local side of the ledger the
Card Babes are tops among college
freshman teams, having almost a
clean slate, marred only by a loss to
Washington High during Christmas
vacation when most of the boys
weren't on hand for the encounter.
Height, playing experience, and
floor finesse will show as Indian
meets Indian Friday, with Stanford's
Papooses easily favored on cold
dope.
