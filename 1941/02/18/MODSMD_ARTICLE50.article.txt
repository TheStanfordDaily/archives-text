# Skier 'Changes' Sex for Race
## 
### 
Bob Blatt tried a "turn-about"â€”
I but it didn't work.
"Last call for the men-women
ski relay," shouted the starter last
Sunday at Badger Pass where the
Stanford ski week-end was in prog
ress.
Six teams of two men and two
women started for the up-ski. But
I a commotion soon ensued.
"We protest," shouted members of
j five teams. "This is not a 'she' but
j a 'he'." They were pointing at the
! fourth member of the team com
posed of Jack Ditz, George Barloy,
and Betty Boardman.
The accused member was daintily
scarfed, wearing a woman's viser,
but the hulk of Mr. Blatt, a former
national amateur skiing champ, was
I easily recognized.
And three men and a girl atoned
j for their crime by "setting up" the
J crowd during the evening.
