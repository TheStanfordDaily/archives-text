# Ringmen Face Cal Thursday
## 
### 
Fresh from defeat at the hands of
j the Cal Aggie ringmen, Stanford's
boxing team, led by Captain Tom
McMichael, meets the California
Bears Thursday night.
Although the Indians lost last
week-end, they gained lots of well
needed experience. Only three box
ers entered the ring in good shape
as colds and injuries have been
dogging them all season.
Bronson Cooley will handle the
lightweight duties. He was deci
j sioned Friday night in a close fight.
J Milt Vedder gained his first ex
: perience this year in the Aggie bout,
and should do better Thursday in
the 145-pound class.
Captain McMichael, one of the
winners Friday night, is in good
shape to handle his 155-pound du
ties. Jim Thurmond will also fight
in the same class. Frank Ilewitt will
fight in the 145-pound weight, John
Ryan in the 165-pound division, Mel
I Ellett in the light-heavy class, and
Johnny Ward will take over the
i heavyweight fight.
