known laughingly as The Tiger of
Philadelphia, last night became the
fourteenth to go down before the
onslaught of Joe Louis in the monot
onous defense of his world's heavy
weight boxing championship before
16,000 hopeful? in Philadelphia.
The show ended after one minute,
30 seconds of the second round as
Louis confused Dorazio with lefts to
the face and body, then unleashed a
terrific right to the chin.
One moment the man whose feeble j
qualifications were a good deal of I
courage and victories over Bob Pas- i
tor, A1 McCoy, and Red Burman was
holding his own with body blows
while crouching lower than Arturo
Godoy. At next glance Gus was
stretched out on the canvas, follow
ing a precedent set long ago by the
Bomber's first opponent.
"I just wails for him to come up,"
said The Master after the workout,
"that was the best right I ever

threwed."
During the first round "The Tiger"
kept Louis busy by bobbing and
weaving and backing him into the
ropes. But the champion refused to
get excited even though the round
was a draw. He settled down in the
second round to some good hard
punching and the fight was over.
Dorazio was the third of Joe's op
ponents in his campaign of a light a
month,
