WITH the declaration of war by the United
States in April 1917, Stanford became prac
tically an armed camp with almost 500 men
enlisting for duty during the first two days of
that momentous spring quarter.
However, in 1941, the situation is different.
Young Americans are not needed on Europe's
battlefields. Though America did enact a his
tory-making peace-time draft law to train, over
a period of five years, four and a half million
men, this new Selective Service Act was to be
truly selective. It was to avoid all the old pit
falls of 1917 —dentists being impressed into the
cooks division and the like.
Today, the war we are fighting is one in
which the prime needs of the country are sane
thinking and good civil as well as military lead
ership.
Last September President Roosevelt, in a
statement sent to all educational institutions,
warned college students against interrupting
their education to enlist for military service or
work in defense industries.
"Such a decision would be unfortunate," he
said.
"We must have well-educated and intelligent
citizens who have sound judgment in dealing
with the difficult problems of today."
The student who feared that the draft might
take him out of college before completing his
education heaved a sigh of relief at the Presi
dent's statement.
In those vague October days when few,
if any, knew just how the act was going to
work, students were soothed with the gener
ality, "Of course, students will be deferred."

But right now many Stanford men in the
classes of '42, '43, and '44 are faced with just
that prospect which Mr. Roosevelt warned
against—the interruption of their all-important
education.
They have been tricked by a technicality of
the law which stated that students would be
placed in the deferred classification 1-D, until
July 1, 1941. They now find that after that date
they are at the mercy of their local boards with
respect to continuance of their college careers.
And the latest order from Washington—we
hope not from the President's office—is to have
no regard for "personal inconvenience."
With the exception of med students, engi
neers, and the like, no consideration is being
given undergraduates; no thought being given
to the greater possibilities of service to the na
tion which a college graduate can give.
With the estimated four and one-half million
Class 1-A men who registered last October 16,
it seems that the draft administrators could
make it possible for completion of university
schooling before army training begins.
And above all it seems that the words of the
President have been swept aside by the rising
tide of a kind of "preliminary war fever" in
America.—C. B.
