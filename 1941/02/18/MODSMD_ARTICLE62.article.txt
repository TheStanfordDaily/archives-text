# BULL SESSION
## THE 						MUSIC GOES 'ROUND AND 'ROUND 
### DWIGHT HUTCHINSON 
r JpHERE are two things that Bull Sessioners can write
about and be funny. They are the Cellar, and the
Cellar. At this time I'm not going to write about
either of these.
Every year it seems to old-timers that Stanford's
overcrowded activity wheel is spinning faster and
faster, and with less direction than ever before. And
every year an "activity class" develops, the committee
women and the committee men. They come by their
position in this class by virtue of the number of drives
they've served on, the number of friends they have
who are in office, and the success of the projects with
which they've been concerned.
Their standing in Farm society is achieved in gen
eral by the work they do and not by the cars they
drive and the money they spend. Quite often they
don't particularly seek jobs. Their names are known
by harassed chairmen who button-hole them and ask
for a little help. And before they know it they're
carrying on about six different activities and every
day is so clogged with appointments and meetings,
most of which consist of having a coke in the Cellar,
that the academic side of the picture is completely
overlooked. And their taste for cokes has disappeared.

Jf ATELY, however, there have been a couple of
developments in the extra-curricular system that
may change matters a little. Both of them have grown
out of a conviction on the part of Ex Committee that
work should be extended and somewhat thinned.
Johnny Porter's "Drives" committee (not to be
confused with the Dies Committee) has been func
tioning quietly for about four months. It began the
job by determining approximately what agencies would
seek money on campus this year—and then it cut down
their proposed drive periods to the most effective mini
mum. In addition, the Drives Committee spotted drives
on the calendar so that they didn't conflict with one
another. Whenever possible, it left plenty of breath
ing space between them. Any such regulatory mech
anism as this helps to keep the Farm from being driven
to death—and the people who work on such things
from rolling out too rapidly. The mentality rate is
pretty high.

IJETTY AVERY and Phil Rosenthal are the new
"activities dictators" who are running the compli
cated Card File system instituted by Excom this year.
No committee can be picked without their approval.
And every undergrad who wants to try his hand at
working for the Convalescent Home, decorating the
Pavilion for a dance, or pinning up posters can have
a fling at it—provided he signs up at the office.
It's a little tough to get anything like this started,
but once it begins to roll it becomes an accepted prac
tice and no one thinks twice about using it. The Card
File will be a tremendous relief to tired committeemen
and women who can now "retire to a Farm" and spend
a little time reading books, studying in the library,
listening to Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, and Benny
Goodman.
