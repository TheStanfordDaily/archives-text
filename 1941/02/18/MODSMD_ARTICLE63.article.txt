HPHE EDITOR, SIR:
It was early morn. I had just risen and ad
journed to the Cellar for some hotcakes and milk.
I trudged wearily down the steps and fought my way
to a seat. As I picked myself up, a handsome hasher
with flowing black hair and bags under his eyes
from too many hangovers threw a glass of water in
my direction and snarled, not unlike Edward G. Rob
inson out of the corner of his mouth: "What'll ya
have?"
I wiped the water out of my eyes and said weakly,
"Hotcakes and milk."
"Hokay," he said, and rocked backward and for
ward on his feet.
After about five minutes he was still rocking back
wards and forwards on his feet and gazing at some
girl from Roble who was daintily sipping a ten-cent
coke.
In the faintness of starvation I said, 'Please, sir."
He glared down at me as I lay in a stupor on the
counter.
"Well, what da you want?"
"Hotcakes and milk," 1 said with as much courage
as I could muster.
"Hokay, why didn't ya say so."
He strode to the kitchen window and shouted,
"Stack ahots."
The cook busily and serviceably cooked up the hot
cakes and left them smoking on the shelf by the
kitchen window.
By this time my head was reeling.
The hasher continued to look at the Roble girl sip
ping her coke.
The steam had ceased to appear from the brown
crisp cakes.
I glanced pleadingly at the hasher. He continued
to look at the Roble girl. My eyes rolled upward in
the beginnings of complete unconsciousness. I felt
the room begin to swirl about me. The hasher only
leered passionately at the Roble girl sipping her
coke . . .
