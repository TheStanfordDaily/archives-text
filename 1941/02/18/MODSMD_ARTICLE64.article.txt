r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
."Formation of the exclusive '300' club is now
being made known on the Stanford campus. At pres
ent there are only three members in the organization
and all are officers."—Daily, Feb. 13, 1941.
From time immemorial it has been the scholar's
lot to carry a cross, but these are the first scholars
ever to put neon lights on it. This action bears out
the contention of the Activities Files—"There is a place
and position for every Stanford man"—even if he has
to create that position himself.
We are thoroughly impressed with the colossal av
erages displayed by the Tedious Trio, but we are even
more impressed with the time and effort they must
have spent in leafing through the Bawlout looking for
each other. Stanford traditions as old as the pave
ment in her streets are threatened by what appears
to be a mutual approbation and back-slapping society.
The organization, by its restricted membership, con
flicts with democratic ideals.
In the interests of democracy and for the benefit
of the vast majority at Stanford who are doomed to
lifelong exclusion from the "300" we arc organizing
the "Minus-a-few" Club. Undoubtedly we will have
more members and consequently more friends than
our "rivals." Our system will allow the person most
minus to be president, next-most-minus vice-presi
dent, etc. It might be added that our club is organized
for those who prefer to play "cat-and-mouse" rather
than "ball" with the professors.
"Minus 3" (President pro tem)
"Minus 1" (V P. pro tempore)
"Plus 2" (Rushee)
