# Sherwood Makes War Plea As Lunts Realistic

"And the nations <if them which are saved shall walk in the light of it;
and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it."
"And the gales of it shall not be shut at all by day: for There Shall He
No Night there."
From the twenty-fifth verse of Chapter 21 of Revelations in the

the title of his latest play of the rise
and fall of the Finnish Mannerheim
line.
LUNTS REALISTIC
The Lunts, Alfred and Lynn, are
putting flesh and blood into the ve
hicle as they bring it to San Fran
cisco audiences from the stage of the
Curran Theater. The play closes
Saturday evening, Feb. 22.
There is precious little an inade

say about such a thing as this Sher
wood play after metropolitan editors
have damned it, prime ministers
have applauded it and actors have
had their lives changed by it.
Yet it is that sort of a production
that compels a comment, regardless
of inexperience and undeveloped
capacities. The Lunts, to first deal
with the cast, are, as the Lunts al
ways are, superb. The supporting
cast is excellent. Each one is every
inch his part. Never is there a let
down. Never do you wonder why
a certain person is playing a par
ticular part.
SHERWOOD CONFUSED
I will admit I have been hedging
up to now. I am reluctant to ex
press my view of the play itself. I
am afraid I shall be contemptuously
classed with those who have before
me been accused of calling Sher
wood a "warmonger."
But unless I say I am disap
pointed in the Sherwood of "Idiot's
Delight" and "Acropolis" I should be
insincere. It is not that I find fault
with the technique and the lines
and the settings. These are good and
fine, only as a playwright such as I
believe Robert Sherwood is, could
bring forth.
I am disappointed because I think
the author has written himself into
a confused mire. I am disappointed
because Sherwood the pacifist has
become a confused, disillusioned j
