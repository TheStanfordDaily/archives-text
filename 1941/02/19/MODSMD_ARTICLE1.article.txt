r words "pacification" and "in
filtration" are being used by all
the experts these days in reference
to what the Nazis are doing in the
Balkans. For some reason or other
the writer is reminded of football
announcer Ted Husing's use of the
verb "to seep" in describing the
actions of a fullback during a line
plunge.
Hitler, clearing the way for his
"Drang nach Osten" is "pacifying"
the Balkan countries by means of a
subtle "infiltration" of about 600,000
Germans in Rumania and 30,000 to
50,000 in Bulgaria.
Apparently the Soviets feel that,
even if the Greeks do not capitu
late, and Hitler drives down
through Bulgaria to vital Salonika,
he will make no attempt to take
the Dardanelles. The Greeks arc
out on their peninsular limb right
now, and will probably accept an
arbitrary peace, since they cannot
possibly fight a war on two fronts.
The terrain from the southern
Bulgarian frontier down to Salonika
is ideally suited to the Nazis' brand
of mechanized warfare — and far
different from the rough Albanian
mountains over which the Greeks
have been gleefully chasing the
Italians for the past several months.

r pHE tough Hellenes face an un
fortunate choice. If they give in
now they will undoubtedly be sub
jected. to the same sort of "infiltra
tion" being enjoyed by the rest of
their Balkan neighbors; but a war
with the Nazis on their home
ground, with conquest the almost
inevitable result, is not a pleasant
choice either.
According to European com
mentators, Hitler will probably
allow Greece to keep its Albanian
gains, "for the present." That
should make them feel just fine.
In the meantime, Great Britain is
losing her last foothold on the Con
tinent, though she may be able to
hold Crete, the island she occupied
at the outbreak of the Greek-Italian
affair. But her problems are going
to become even more difficult.

AfIRGINIO GAYDA in his "Po
polo d'ltalia" yesterday let it be
known that the battered Duce has a
new plan in store, when he said that
"something very big" was about to
happen. The vague remark carried
no amplification.
Since England's African ojid
Near East forces are so widely
scattered, it is probable that the
Axis partners have in mind some
thing in the nature of an all-out
naval and air attack on Gibraltar
and the Suez. With command of
the Greek peninsula and tentative
Spanish co-opcration, the move
would be quite feasible. If it docs
come, General Wavcll is going to
have his hands full.
The remnant of a silver lining for
England did show through the Bal
kan clouds today, however. Accord
ing to one commentator, it all hinges
on Britain's diplomatic break with
Rumania.

1 ERMANY's oil supply has been
' taken almost completely from
the Rumanian fields, which in nor
mal times supply approximately
48,400,000 barrels a year, and from
a Polish field which produces
3,800,000 a year. They have been
supplementing these stores with
synthetic and low temperature oil
products from coal.
If the British can bomb the Ru
manian oil fields out of commis
sion, and get at the Polish field
with the same effect, Germany will
be forced to fall back on her syn
thetic products and what she can
gain from Soviet Russia.
This would be of effective aid to
the British only if they can with
stand the coming invasion, since
Germany has large reserve stocks
on hand. But, in the long run, a
shortage of oil would prove a defi
nite disadvantage to Germany.
England, at present, is doing its
best to put Germany's synthetic coal
plants out of order, though with
what effect we do not know. The
problem is an interesting one to
speculate upon, anyhow.
Perhaps the Nazis will have to
widen their present policy of "guns
for butter" to include "icy bed
rooms for oil."

1 ERMANY's oil supply has been
' taken almost completely from
the Rumanian fields, which in nor
mal times supply approximately
48,400,000 barrels a year, and from
a Polish field which produces
3,800,000 a year. They have been
supplementing these stores with
synthetic and low temperature oil
products from coal.
If the British can bomb the Ru
manian oil fields out of commis
sion, and get at the Polish field
with the same effect, Germany will
be forced to fall back on her syn

This would be of effective aid to
the British only if they can with

Germany has large reserve stocks
on hand. But, in the long run, a
shortage of oil would prove a defi

England, at present, is doing its

plants out of order, though with

Hitler, clearing the way for his

the Balkan countries by means of a
subtle "infiltration" of about 600,000
Germans in Rumania and 30,000 to
50,000 in Bulgaria.
Apparently the Soviets feel that,
even if the Greeks do not capitu
late, and Hitler drives down
through Bulgaria to vital Salonika,
he will make no attempt to take
the Dardanelles. The Greeks arc
out on their peninsular limb right
now, and will probably accept an
arbitrary peace, since they cannot
possibly fight a war on two fronts.
The terrain from the southern
Bulgarian frontier down to Salonika

AfIRGINIO GAYDA in his "Po

no amplification.
Since England's African ojid
Near East forces are so widely
scattered, it is probable that the
Axis partners have in mind some
thing in the nature of an all-out
naval and air attack on Gibraltar
and the Suez. With command of
the Greek peninsula and tentative
Spanish co-opcration, the move
would be quite feasible. If it docs

have his hands full.

1 ERMANY's oil supply has been
' taken almost completely from
the Rumanian fields, which in nor
mal times supply approximately
48,400,000 barrels a year, and from
a Polish field which produces
3,800,000 a year. They have been
supplementing these stores with
synthetic and low temperature oil
products from coal.
If the British can bomb the Ru
manian oil fields out of commis
sion, and get at the Polish field
with the same effect, Germany will
be forced to fall back on her syn
thetic products and what she can
gain from Soviet Russia.
This would be of effective aid to
the British only if they can with
stand the coming invasion, since
Germany has large reserve stocks
on hand. But, in the long run, a
shortage of oil would prove a defi
nite disadvantage to Germany.
England, at present, is doing its
best to put Germany's synthetic coal
plants out of order, though with
what effect we do not know. The
problem is an interesting one to
speculate upon, anyhow.
Perhaps the Nazis will have to
widen their present policy of "guns

the experts these days in reference

Balkans. For some reason or other
the writer is reminded of football
announcer Ted Husing's use of the
verb "to seep" in describing the
actions of a fullback during a line

Hitler, clearing the way for his
"Drang nach Osten" is "pacifying"
the Balkan countries by means of a
subtle "infiltration" of about 600,000
Germans in Rumania and 30,000 to
50,000 in Bulgaria.
Apparently the Soviets feel that,
even if the Greeks do not capitu
late, and Hitler drives down
through Bulgaria to vital Salonika,
he will make no attempt to take
the Dardanelles. The Greeks arc
out on their peninsular limb right
now, and will probably accept an
arbitrary peace, since they cannot
possibly fight a war on two fronts.
The terrain from the southern
Bulgarian frontier down to Salonika
is ideally suited to the Nazis' brand
of mechanized warfare — and far
different from the rough Albanian
mountains over which the Greeks
have been gleefully chasing the
Italians for the past several months.
