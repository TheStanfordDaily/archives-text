# Kick-off Dinner Inaugurates Family Call
## Drive Head Praises Student Volunteers For Aiding Stanford 
### 
Paul C. Edward, '<)♦», chairman of
the Stanford Fund Committee, asked
120 callers and drive leaders of the
Stanford Family Call at a Kickoff
Dinner in the Union last night to
"come back with the bacon if you
can."
"Thanks for what you're going to
do," Mr. Edwards said. "You're go
ing to run up against a few tough
customers but you'll run up against
a great many more who will be ex
tremely friendly and intei'ested."
Mr. Edwards, present associate
editor of the San Francisco News and
president of the Commonwealth
Club, spoke to the students as they
were about to set out in couples on
informal visits to friends and alumni
of Stanford throughout the Penin
sula to seek gifts for the University
in its Fiftieth Anniversary year.
SERVICE TO STANFORD
Paul Davis, '22, director of the
Stanford Fund, declared the students
as volunteers had the opportunity of
doing a real service for their Uni
versity.
"Happy dollars to Stanford's Birth
day should be the slogan of the
drive," he said, "and we want every
dollar that comes in to be a happy
dollar."
ENACT CALL'
With the aid of students Isabel
Faweett, John Lawry, and Norman
Ross, Mr. Davis "demonstrated" in
skit-style the techniques of "how to
conduct a call" and "how not to
conduct a call."
The callers would have an excel
lent opportunity to make many new
friends on their visits, Mr. Davis
pointed out, and he asserted that
even those friends or alumni who
"seemed a bit gruff, underneath put
Stanford on a lofty pedestal."
Bob Newell, chairman of the Fam
ily Council, introduced the speakers
and said students were happy "to
do their part" as members of the
Stanford family.
GUESTS PRESENT
At the speakers' table, in addition
to Mr. Edwards, Mr. Davis, and
Newell, were Mi lion Marks, Jack
Burns, Lois Whitmore, and John
Moore.
Following the dinner, the students
departed to begin their assigned
calls. Students, a man and a woman
working together, will call on some
600 alumni and friends of the Uni
versity in the next few days.
