# German Chiefs Demamd 'Quick Peace' In Greece On Occupation Threat
## Fascist Troops Repulsed by Hellenes Along Albanian Fronts as Britain, U.S. Push Asiatic Defense Moves

SOFIA, Feb. IS (UP). â€”Germany was reported in authoritative quar
ters tonight to have launched conversations in Sofia demanding a "quick
peace" between Greece and Italy under threat of a German military occu
pation of Greece.
The latest move of Adolf Hitler to drive the British oil the European

denied in Greek quarters,
followed a British warning that
Bulgaria may be moving toward war
and a reported British threat to
bomb Rumanian military objectives
if German troops enter the country.
The Germans are serving as inter
mediaries using the new Turkish-
Bulgarian declaration of neutrality
and non-aggression as the means of
bringing pressure on the Greeks.
Germany was said to have given
the Greeks two alternatives:
1. Submit to a quick peace with
Italy.
2. A German military occupation
of Greece before Britain can rush
reinforcements there from the
north African coast.
The Germans were said to have
warned Greece might well be
come a battleground for the Ger
man and British armed forces if
the British reinforcements ar
rived before the Nazi occupation
could be carried out.
Greek quarters denied the Athens
government recently had asked the
British to refrain from sending any
troops to Gi'eece.
Semi-official quarters in Sofia to
night called the Turkish-Bulgarian
declaration a Gel-man move, which
may well have been encouraged by
Russia, because of a Soviet desire to
turn the Germans through Bulgaria
rather than toward the Dardanelles
to isolate Turkey from Britain, with
whom she had a mutual aid alli
ance.
The disclosure of Germany's de
mands for a "quick peace" between
Greece and Italy followed a British
warning to Bulgaria diplomatic re
lations may be broken.
