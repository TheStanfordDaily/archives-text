SHANGHAI, Wed., Feb. 19 (UP).
â€”Britain and the United States
will continue to push their mili
tary preparations in southeast
Asia despite an official declara
tion in Tokyo that Japan desires
peace and a settlement of all dis
putes by mediation, it was stated
in informed quarters today.
Japan's declared desire to assume
a world peacemaker's role encoun
tered official skepticism today and
j President Roosevelt and Congress
j moved to buttress United States de
i fenses in the Pacific, the Atlantic,
| and the Caribbean.
The White House and State De
: partment took a "show us" attitude
toward Japanese peace statements.
